1
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,180
And we're live Mr Maxwell.
How are you sir?

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:11,390
Mr Rogen.
Always say your brother and you brought 

3
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:11,390
your bag of all your belongings.
All my goodies,

4
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:13,650
man.
Everything I own in this world.

5
00:00:13,651 --> 00:00:14,610
I'll show it to you.
Yeah.

6
00:00:14,611 --> 00:00:17,430
This always curious about this.
This always comes up with my wife.

7
00:00:17,431 --> 00:00:19,530
Whenever I say Steve Maxwell is going to
be on the podcast.

8
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,300
That's that guy that lives out of the 
bag.

9
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:22,800
Look at.
I'm pretty crazy.

10
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,590
This is everything I owned in as well.
That's insane.

11
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,620
Right in my back.
He has a um,

12
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,070
I mean that's not even a really large 
backpack.

13
00:00:32,071 --> 00:00:34,770
Like if you brought that elk hunting,
people would be upset with him.

14
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,160
And then a little little man purse.
Yeah.

15
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:40,810
So man,
purse backpack,

16
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,660
my chords and my ipad,
stuff like that.

17
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:47,770
And I travel all over the world.
Wow.

18
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:50,770
Pack really carefully.
As you can imagine.

19
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:53,290
Three petite shirts,
three pair of pants,

20
00:00:53,291 --> 00:00:56,370
three pair of shorts,
a rain jacket too.

21
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:58,540
Lightweight hoodies,
long sleeve tee shirt.

22
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:03,870
I could pretty much recite.
I never felt more liberated than when I 

23
00:01:04,181 --> 00:01:08,050
got rid of all my stuff and I'm in a 
different country every couple of weeks.

24
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:09,280
A lot of people say,
hey,

25
00:01:09,281 --> 00:01:10,750
why not the roller bag,
Steve,

26
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:16,240
if you travel in any kind of third world
country down cobblestones.

27
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,550
Uh,
I actually had a roller bag,

28
00:01:18,551 --> 00:01:23,260
but I ditched my first trip to London,
a change trains like four times going up

29
00:01:23,261 --> 00:01:25,090
and down these damn stairs by the clunk,
clunk,

30
00:01:25,091 --> 00:01:26,410
clunk back.
I said,

31
00:01:26,411 --> 00:01:28,060
you know what,
this really sucks.

32
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:30,510
I'm going to carry it on my body.
So that's,

33
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,110
um,
I don't get any money from these guys.

34
00:01:32,111 --> 00:01:37,111
But as the tom been fantastic travel 
bags so well configured,

35
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:39,550
you wouldn't believe this stuff.
I get in there.

36
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:41,720
I even had my whole workout gym and that
thing,

37
00:01:41,721 --> 00:01:42,610
man.
Really?

38
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:45,280
And what kind of stuff's in there that 
you carry around with you everywhere

39
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,260
now,
this Tom Ben,

40
00:01:47,261 --> 00:01:49,670
is this for hiking or is this just 
primarily a trap?

41
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,690
Well,
there's a travel ban.

42
00:01:50,691 --> 00:01:53,160
I want to take a serious hike with it.
But,

43
00:01:53,161 --> 00:01:54,960
uh,
it looks like it's pretty sturdy,

44
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:58,050
very sturdy.
I use packing cubes.

45
00:01:58,051 --> 00:02:03,051
There's different packing ways,
a good resource for your listeners that 

46
00:02:03,051 --> 00:02:05,130
travel full time,
go to one bag.com.

47
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:09,030
He has many recommendations for various 
bags and uh,

48
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:14,480
where you can just basically one carry 
on bag and travel anywhere in the world 

49
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:14,940
for several weeks at a time

50
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:20,880
if you want to smell one bag.
A lot of this stuff is high tech.

51
00:02:21,551 --> 00:02:23,470
I just washed my tee shirts out in the 
sink,

52
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,630
you know,
very well if you,

53
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,050
if you were,
um,

54
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:32,090
one of the things that I've found from 
hiking and camping for long periods of 

55
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:32,740
times.
Wool wool is great.

56
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,800
There's a great company called First 
Light First Lit II that I'm a buddy 

57
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,840
minds part of my friend Ryan Callahan.
I'm out of Montana and actually catch my

58
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:46,870
dough him in Montana,
but they make will outer gear and inner 

59
00:02:47,621 --> 00:02:49,020
gear like,
um,

60
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:52,070
long johns stuff along those lines.
Fantastic.

61
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,480
A lot of hunting gear and you can wear 
that stuff for days,

62
00:02:55,481 --> 00:02:56,470
days,
days,

63
00:02:56,471 --> 00:03:00,280
and it doesn't smell stuff is this 
stretch polya mine.

64
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:05,200
It's a little of that Hashtag a,
a nylon type material,

65
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:09,550
which real stretchy.
It's a silver impregnated sober,

66
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:14,650
uh,
help stop the bacteria from so you can 

67
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:15,790
get like three or four days out of this 
tee shirt.

68
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:16,880
Really?
Yeah.

69
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,370
And doesn't stay.
Maybe you could.

70
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,570
Well,
I stinky,

71
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:21,970
stinky,
Pervs my gym.

72
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:27,690
Check this out.
I can train a rubber band.

73
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,590
It nice and metrics.
I can do.

74
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:34,620
Good morning.
What is the amount of tension on that 

75
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:34,620
railroad?
They just say heavy duty,

76
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,970
but remember the further you stretch it,
the smarter it gets.

77
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:40,300
It gets this old man.
Plenty of a stretch.

78
00:03:40,301 --> 00:03:45,301
Maybe not.
You have a bowling ball bag that I 

79
00:03:45,301 --> 00:03:48,541
bought just so I could take on the road 
with me so I could throw a 50 pound 

80
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:48,541
kettlebell in it.
Yeah,

81
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:50,560
that works.
Although I try not to check,

82
00:03:50,561 --> 00:03:51,580
but don't use it once.

83
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,280
This is a my cardio,
a little jump rope,

84
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:56,740
rope.
Anytime,

85
00:03:56,741 --> 00:03:57,420
anyplace,
anywhere.

86
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,410
He can't run.
I like to do a little running.

87
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,630
Best self defense ever.
Right?

88
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:03,790
Sprint the hell away,
man.

89
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:05,470
Yeah.
If you could run further than the person

90
00:04:05,471 --> 00:04:06,370
trying to kill you.
You know,

91
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,340
I,
I don't want to be.

92
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,360
I don't want to be like one of these old
guys that can't run,

93
00:04:10,361 --> 00:04:12,050
so it comes in handy.
That's great.

94
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,310
And this is a little homemade,
a suspension device.

95
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:20,140
I can set this any length.
A suspension device.

96
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,570
I use a price and metrics.
Body weight rows,

97
00:04:22,571 --> 00:04:24,190
Chin ups.
Basically.

98
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,380
Do you know your knots?
Not really.

99
00:04:26,381 --> 00:04:28,000
I used to be a boy scout back in the 
day.

100
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,880
I know a couple of fishing knots.
Low line,

101
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,410
right.
You just to cover that one pvc.

102
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,160
And then uh,
this is called a,

103
00:04:35,161 --> 00:04:40,161
a,
a perisic not so I can slide this right 

104
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:45,570
up and down the handle,
but if you would grab that handle and 

105
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:46,510
put weight on it,
say it doesn't move obviously.

106
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,430
So it's instantly adjustable.
Huh?

107
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,660
That's interesting.
Yeah.

108
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,500
Pressing,
not.

109
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:54,220
It's a climber's.
Dispel that process per u.

110
00:04:54,221 --> 00:04:58,050
s I k a.
If you go to an animated knots,

111
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:00,180
it's like a little app you can throw on 
your iphone.

112
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:02,380
It shows you how to do the API called.
What is it?

113
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,570
Animated.
Animated.

114
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:05,220
You can,
uh,

115
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,180
you shows you every kind of not.
So I can just throw this over a tree.

116
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,710
Do Chin ups,
body weight rows.

117
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:16,740
Oh Wow.
But if I want I can stand on it and I 

118
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,210
can do isometrics.
I'm really indecisive metrics.

119
00:05:18,211 --> 00:05:18,760
These.
Yeah.

120
00:05:18,761 --> 00:05:23,761
You showed me a lot of those the last 
time we worked out together and it was 

121
00:05:23,761 --> 00:05:24,280
really interesting what you're trying to
do now.

122
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:27,360
Isolation type movements.
I can do dead lifts.

123
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:33,060
Just absolutely incredible what it the 
kind of work it can get like 15,

124
00:05:33,821 --> 00:05:34,300
20 minutes.

125
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,730
Great for you.
You're on the road doing your comedy act

126
00:05:36,731 --> 00:05:40,980
all the time.
Going to the UFC and Kettlebell.

127
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:45,990
It's good,
but it is a pain in the ass to lug 

128
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:46,510
around and you can just in your hotel 
room,

129
00:05:46,511 --> 00:05:49,300
literally in 20 minutes,
your tongue will be hanging out.

130
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:52,090
Shockingly Metabolic,
uh,

131
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,960
amazing cardio at the same time.
You get every,

132
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,880
every muscle from your to your feet.
Good stuff.

133
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:01,180
I knew about isometrics back in the 
sixties when,

134
00:06:01,181 --> 00:06:02,300
uh,
as a young wrestler,

135
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,330
a coach use to use a lot of this stuff.
So anyway,

136
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:10,331
that's the workout gym.
Know Bruce Lee was really into 

137
00:06:10,331 --> 00:06:10,331
isometrics.
He was a,

138
00:06:10,331 --> 00:06:12,410
he was into what they would call dynamic
tension,

139
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:15,590
which is essentially the same thing,
the Great Charles Atlas,

140
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,900
Charles Bronson,
the Charles Atlas,

141
00:06:17,901 --> 00:06:21,770
those comic book ads of these to have in
the back like becoming a,

142
00:06:21,771 --> 00:06:24,290
you were 98 pound weakling,
becoming like a big stud.

143
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:29,470
That was like what he was advertised a 
lot of different dynamic tension 

144
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:29,470
exercise for,
uh,

145
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:30,960
the father of modern,
uh,

146
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:36,040
ice metrics was the guy by the name of 
Alexandra is asked who was a Russian 

147
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,791
circus performer and he was traveling 
around doing wrestling and bending steel

148
00:06:39,951 --> 00:06:43,460
breaking chains over his chest.
He's just a little guy about my size and

149
00:06:43,461 --> 00:06:48,320
he was captured by the Germans during 
World War One and imprisoned and Zass,

150
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:53,510
uh,
in order to get a little extra food 

151
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:53,510
because he's worried about losing his 
physique.

152
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:55,460
He offered to train the comma dance dog 
for extra food.

153
00:06:55,940 --> 00:07:00,940
So meanwhile he's practicing his 
isometrics on the cell bars every day.

154
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:04,460
And he eventually bent the bars and 
escaped,

155
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:10,090
went back to the circus,
got recaptured this time they put him in

156
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:13,010
chains.
He bent the,

157
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,740
he broke the chains and bent the bars 
and escaped.

158
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:18,620
Not just twice,
four times.

159
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,750
He escaped from the Germans bots.
It's all written in his biography.

160
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:27,800
I think it has anyone ever wikipedia 
this gentleman.

161
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,540
Back then they couldn't,
couldn't verify my story,

162
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:37,630
but uh,
there's no doubt that this guy was 

163
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:37,630
strong.
There's actually an old,

164
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:41,141
old,
old black and white youtube of him 

165
00:07:41,141 --> 00:07:41,141
breaking chains and stuff.
She's Alexandra is ass.

166
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,480
Another proponent of isometrics was the 
fame.

167
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:48,110
Henry Wittenberg pull up,
pull up a picture of that guy.

168
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:52,590
Z Ass.
His biography is a big one.

169
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,980
Probably 100.
Sixty pounds under 65.

170
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,630
How the fuck did he been?
Chains?

171
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:59,000
Well,
he started as a kid in the forest.

172
00:07:59,001 --> 00:08:00,800
He,
he actually went to some right there.

173
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,490
Yeah,
there we go.

174
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,190
When he was,
when he was a young boy,

175
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,720
he was really,
really,

176
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:06,890
uh,
I,

177
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:08,990
I'll tell you something,
I've lifted beams like that,

178
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,660
that,
that beam is really heavy.

179
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:16,190
He's got a beam wrapped around his neck 
with his teeth.

180
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,420
Oh my God,
that's,

181
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:22,810
it's a tif lift.
He has a special math piece where he's 

182
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:24,380
gripping it with his jaws and using his 
neck.

183
00:08:24,381 --> 00:08:26,480
Imagine how hard to beat to chuck that 
guy out.

184
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,610
Yeah.
With that kind of net.

185
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,710
That's insane.
And uh,

186
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,960
he,
he would been saplings in the forest 

187
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:35,960
because he couldn't afford steel 
obviously.

188
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:40,420
And he would ben trees to get his 
strength while these guys were the real 

189
00:08:40,911 --> 00:08:42,140
deal back in the day.
Man.

190
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:46,580
They were a pretty amazing.
And it's funny to know supplements,

191
00:08:46,581 --> 00:08:51,581
you know,
no designer whey protein PCA's know 

192
00:08:51,581 --> 00:08:55,760
there was none of this like a dude.
I'm going in a ball like a catabolic.

193
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:55,980
It's

194
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,690
been 15 minutes after my workout,
you know,

195
00:08:57,691 --> 00:08:59,880
they just eat good food and just 
trained,

196
00:08:59,881 --> 00:09:01,200
you know,
a lot of meat.

197
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:04,020
They're also closer to monkeys because 
it was like,

198
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:06,660
it was a long time ago,
long time ago.

199
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,510
It hadn't evolved yet,
but these,

200
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:14,570
these people back then,
they also didn't really understand like 

201
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:17,040
the modern principles of strength and 
conditioning.

202
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:21,000
Like I don't even think they know.
I mean,

203
00:09:21,001 --> 00:09:23,560
I'm not saying it in a bad way at all,
but I don't,

204
00:09:23,561 --> 00:09:28,561
I don't think they necessarily had like 
an understanding of all the mechanisms 

205
00:09:28,561 --> 00:09:30,670
involved.
They just knew you train hard classes,

206
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,300
you get stronger,
train heart gets stronger.

207
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,860
This guy knows what he's doing,
go visit them.

208
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:39,000
You can actually buy his book on Amazon.
Pretty interesting biography.

209
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:44,420
And I found a fence.
It was translated from Russian to 

210
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:44,730
English.
It translates kind of funny.

211
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,920
One of the confusing things is it,
uh,

212
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,010
in Russia they use different names for 
the same person.

213
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,750
So they keep.
Yeah,

214
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:52,680
I know.
It's weird man.

215
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,320
And how so?
Um,

216
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:01,700
he,
they just called them by four different 

217
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:01,700
names.
It was like,

218
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,810
are they nicknames or nicknames like 
Christie's a,

219
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,560
uh,
from the Ukrainian right.

220
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,690
Don't they use different names?
Yeah.

221
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,030
Unfortunately you're off camera.
So we're not going to be able to hear,

222
00:10:12,031 --> 00:10:13,230
you know,
they uh,

223
00:10:13,231 --> 00:10:14,490
they,
they use different names,

224
00:10:14,491 --> 00:10:19,290
like little pet pet names.
And so as I'm reading,

225
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:21,750
I'm thinking who the hell they talking 
about?

226
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:23,850
And then I'm reading back.
Oh,

227
00:10:23,851 --> 00:10:28,851
they're talking about Alexander,
but they referred them with four 

228
00:10:28,851 --> 00:10:32,421
different names in the text and it said 
it was just a kind of a weird 

229
00:10:32,421 --> 00:10:34,290
translation,
but Adley fascinating about his life.

230
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,150
That's so weird.
You know,

231
00:10:36,151 --> 00:10:41,151
it's really interesting when you see 
those old school strongman type 

232
00:10:41,151 --> 00:10:44,061
characters in because there was some 
people that were doing things back in 

233
00:10:44,061 --> 00:10:44,620
the day like you want,
always want.

234
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:46,860
I always bring up the catch wrestling 
pioneer,

235
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:52,090
a farmer,
Burns' farmer burns who used to do 

236
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:53,340
these.
He used to hang himself by his neck.

237
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:55,050
I was like,
pull this up Jamie,

238
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,030
because there's.
There's actually photos of this guy.

239
00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:02,100
This guy had a neck like my waist,
and he only weighed about 165 pounds and

240
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:07,130
he used to drop like a hangman's drop 
and catch himself by his neck.

241
00:11:07,141 --> 00:11:12,141
Look at him here and he was.
He was actually a baiting heavyweights 

242
00:11:12,141 --> 00:11:13,160
back in the day.
This is a.

243
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:15,810
This is a day where I wasn't just for 
the pin,

244
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,390
but you could do submissions in order to
force it.

245
00:11:18,391 --> 00:11:21,420
Got into the shoulders and people could 
also tap.

246
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,810
And this is rough,
tough American martial art.

247
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,190
Yeah.
This is what,

248
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:31,280
what's now known as catch wrestling or 
catch as catch can and when you would 

249
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:35,481
get someone into submission to hold,
they would call it a catch and there 

250
00:11:35,481 --> 00:11:38,331
were a lot of submission holds that they
had back in those days that are still 

251
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:43,041
super effective today.
And if you go back over the old rule 

252
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:43,041
over old,
uh,

253
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:45,930
depictions and old images of submission 
moves from farmer burns,

254
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:48,150
there's stuff that's still completely 
applicable to.

255
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,350
This stuff is awesome,
man.

256
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:52,860
I actually had his original mail order 
course back in the day when,

257
00:11:52,861 --> 00:11:57,861
as a household or collecting stuff.
I actually had his original home 

258
00:11:57,861 --> 00:11:59,140
training course.
Wow.

259
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:04,200
That's amazing.
I had to keep it in plastic and stuff 

260
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:04,200
like that.
Yeah.

261
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:04,200
Like,
look at this.

262
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,920
A neck crank he's got going on here.
He had a lot of the old order.

263
00:12:05,921 --> 00:12:10,921
Nelson man.
There's a lot of moves that they had 

264
00:12:10,921 --> 00:12:13,030
that they used to use back then that are
absolutely effective today.

265
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,590
But just as Josh Barnett.
Yes.

266
00:12:14,591 --> 00:12:19,591
I was just going to bring him out.
He really surprised deet and deeds a 

267
00:12:19,591 --> 00:12:19,591
hell of a black belt,
you know,

268
00:12:19,591 --> 00:12:24,000
really well trained black out and I 
think even he was surprised with that 

269
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,080
headlock.
He caught them in a scarf hold two,

270
00:12:26,081 --> 00:12:28,500
which is like about as old schools that 
gets lost.

271
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:30,520
They get so some of these things are so 
old.

272
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:35,520
They're new younger guys.
I mean when I was coming up the great 

273
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:40,441
and Gracie Jujitsu,
there were so many different defenses 

274
00:12:40,441 --> 00:12:43,681
against a headlock.
We just basically just kinda gave up on 

275
00:12:43,681 --> 00:12:44,920
using it.
But if you don't practice that stuff,

276
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,920
you get some wrestler or catch wrestler,
judo guy,

277
00:12:47,921 --> 00:12:52,921
some rough guy.
It gets you in one of those headlocks 

278
00:12:52,921 --> 00:12:52,921
unexpectedly.
Wow.

279
00:12:52,921 --> 00:12:54,720
He can really hurt you.
Especially a really strong guy.

280
00:12:54,721 --> 00:12:59,721
Like one of the things that's coming 
into play a lot is that bulldog choke 

281
00:12:59,721 --> 00:12:59,721
you,
you,

282
00:12:59,721 --> 00:13:00,070
you rarely see.
You see,

283
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:03,550
like every couple years someone will get
one last one being Raquel Pennington.

284
00:13:03,551 --> 00:13:05,260
Got It on Ashley,
Evan Smith and Ashley.

285
00:13:05,261 --> 00:13:10,261
Evan Smith was kind of known as being 
like the grappler in that match up with 

286
00:13:10,261 --> 00:13:13,271
Raquel Pennington was more of a striker,
but she caught her in that bull dog 

287
00:13:13,271 --> 00:13:16,420
choker and someone's like,
you got a school yard headlock.

288
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:18,550
Okay.
There are other needs or whatever.

289
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,740
Yeah,
right.

290
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:24,960
Right in front of him,
but the thing is when someone's head is 

291
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,170
here and you get that form under the 
choke and you clamp down,

292
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,240
man,
there's not a lot that guy can do.

293
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:31,870
There's not a lot when the head is here 
and if you're a strong person and you're

294
00:13:31,871 --> 00:13:33,640
fully locked in,
you're sitting on it.

295
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,590
There was not a lot.
There you go right there.

296
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:40,830
You see it right there.
We used to refer to that as the Rodeo 

297
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:41,040
chuck because it's like a cowboy ticking
down a steer on most.

298
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:42,310
It's a good way to put it.
Yeah.

299
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:43,560
Actually,
you know,

300
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:48,370
rarely.
Really early was a bruce Lee choked out.

301
00:13:48,371 --> 00:13:53,371
Kareem Abdul Jabbar in the same game of 
death,

302
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,150
game of death.
One of my favorite movies.

303
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,580
He also had the first mma gloves in that
movie,

304
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,720
MMA gloves and enter the Dragon.

305
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,080
The Dragon.
That's right.

306
00:14:05,081 --> 00:14:07,240
That's right.
He did it a.

307
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,850
was it an opera or was it the,
uh,

308
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:11,710
it was a neck crack.
What do they call that?

309
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,600
There's a crucifix of course effects 
there.

310
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:14,770
Yes,
that's right.

311
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,740
So he was pretty burly.
Oh,

312
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:17,950
he was,
you know,

313
00:14:17,951 --> 00:14:22,951
I mean as far as like being open minded,
he was so far ahead of his time with 

314
00:14:22,951 --> 00:14:26,911
combining martial arts mean he truly was
the original mixed martial artist 

315
00:14:26,911 --> 00:14:30,010
because in the time,
like even when I was starting out in the

316
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:30,880
eighties,
the early eighties,

317
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:33,070
you really weren't supposed to train 
anywhere else.

318
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:38,190
Like I would get the stink eye if I 
would go to a boxing gym and try to 

319
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:38,190
learn some boxing,
you know,

320
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:39,810
they would say.
And my truck window school,

321
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:41,500
you basically could learn everything you
want here.

322
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:46,770
You didn't need to go anywhere else and 
he definitely didn't want to learn more 

323
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:46,840
Thai or any of those other techniques.

324
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,360
You just would.
It's taking time away from your practice

325
00:14:49,361 --> 00:14:50,680
here and this is what you really need to
do.

326
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:55,820
Well,
that's martial arts teachers trying to 

327
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:55,820
protect their turf.
They,

328
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,410
you know,
they're worried about losing income.

329
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:00,110
If the students are going from this to 
that to the other thing,

330
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:02,210
will you see it from even Jujitsu 
instructors,

331
00:15:02,211 --> 00:15:07,211
unfortunately with Jujitsu instructors 
who only trained with the GE start 

332
00:15:07,211 --> 00:15:11,171
saying terrible things about people 
train Nogi and the reason being is 

333
00:15:11,171 --> 00:15:13,820
because they have too many techniques 
that rely upon handles on handles.

334
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,370
Yeah.
And as soon as they roll with a grappler

335
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:16,950
and they're,
they're,

336
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:21,960
they're going Nogi and they roll with 
like a really good solid college 

337
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,790
wrestler,
they're going to get smoked.

338
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,770
It's pretty tough.
They just can't.

339
00:15:24,771 --> 00:15:29,771
They can't deal with someone who's just 
really good at manipulating bodies that 

340
00:15:29,771 --> 00:15:33,161
are sweaty and with gable grips and 
hooks and under hooks and their use of 

341
00:15:33,161 --> 00:15:34,880
those collars and they used to like 
grabbing sleeves.

342
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:39,880
It's a whole different game and being a 
former NCAA division one wrestler I 

343
00:15:40,281 --> 00:15:42,990
hated that gave for my first three years
or so.

344
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:48,020
And then finally as I started getting a 
little old are getting close to my ffts,

345
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:53,260
I started loving it because it does slow
that game down and completely slows it 

346
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:57,041
down.
So if you're a smaller and weaker you 

347
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:57,041
can,
you can.

348
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:58,730
The gate definitely gives you a chance 
to even the odds they're a little bit.

349
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,500
Well,
it allows you to control people.

350
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,990
And I think one of the things that's 
really good about the key is people that

351
00:16:02,991 --> 00:16:07,991
live in cold climates.
If you ever get in a self defense 

352
00:16:07,991 --> 00:16:10,721
situation with some war and a jacket,
like I had a conversation with a friend 

353
00:16:10,721 --> 00:16:10,820
of mine and I said,
if you are,

354
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
if you are in some sort of a street 
fight with Jujitsu,

355
00:16:14,001 --> 00:16:16,400
black belt and you have a leather jacket
on,

356
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:21,430
you might as well be a dead person 
because if that guy just grabs your 

357
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:24,371
collar,
I'll have to do is get inside your 

358
00:16:24,371 --> 00:16:25,991
collar,
grab a hold of the back of that collar 

359
00:16:25,991 --> 00:16:25,991
and you're gone.

360
00:16:25,991 --> 00:16:28,950
You're gone.
He's going to just clamp on the other 

361
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:28,950
side and he's going to choke you to 
death.

362
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:30,770
Like you have a weapon or it actually 
is.

363
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:33,770
Yeah.
People always think like,

364
00:16:33,771 --> 00:16:35,710
I'm like in a straight fight,
you know,

365
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:40,740
you're going to be using all this fancy 
stuff that you got to be the most basic 

366
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,500
stuff you learn as a white belt at a 
blue about to fall back on that stuff.

367
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:43,750
Most likely.
Yeah.

368
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:44,690
I mean,
you know,

369
00:16:44,691 --> 00:16:45,860
you have to think,
you know,

370
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:50,000
like a person who you're fighting 
probably is not a trained martial artist

371
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:55,270
know most likely a buddy of mine got in 
a street fight with a train martial 

372
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:56,840
artist once he told me that these two 
guy,

373
00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:02,170
he and this other guy was like yelling 
at each other or something on the 

374
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:05,021
highway and they decided to pull over.
So they pulled over to the side of the 

375
00:17:05,021 --> 00:17:05,021
road.

376
00:17:05,021 --> 00:17:08,440
They got out and they started duking it 
out and he threw a leg kick and the guy 

377
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:12,340
checked it and the guy shot for a double
and he stuffed it and they're both 

378
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:12,340
looking at it.
You're like,

379
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:13,670
oh shit.
Oh Shit.

380
00:17:13,671 --> 00:17:18,671
And they said they went at it for like 
10 minutes and then high fived each 

381
00:17:18,671 --> 00:17:21,500
other afterwards and got back in the car
that had a good outcome.

382
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:22,580
Well,
they've realized.

383
00:17:22,581 --> 00:17:23,240
They're like,
oh,

384
00:17:23,241 --> 00:17:26,210
okay.
We thought another train guy,

385
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:31,240
they thought they were good.
Each guy thought they were going to get 

386
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:31,240
out and beat the shit out of some guy 
who didn't know what he was doing.

387
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,480
And they both got out and then moving 
around like,

388
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,810
oh,
look at this motherfucker.

389
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:36,590
And then after awhile they,
they thought it was funny.

390
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:39,260
That is.
Well I have,

391
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:44,710
I have used digital jobs in the fight 
and the street straight back when I had 

392
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:46,250
my school in Philadelphia.

393
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:51,370
Oh,
when crazy people would come into town 

394
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:52,690
or something.
Well we had jim fights but a couple of 

395
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:52,690
times even on the street,
you know,

396
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:53,190
just crazy stuff,
man.

397
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:57,240
Had a cab driver tried to run me over 
one time and I was furious.

398
00:17:57,241 --> 00:17:57,740
I was,
oh yeah.

399
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,790
I used to commute by bike quite a bit.
And um,

400
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,600
when I went by,
I was so mad I,

401
00:18:01,601 --> 00:18:06,601
I hit this out of his cab and you know,
just gave him a couple of my express my 

402
00:18:08,551 --> 00:18:13,551
opinion.
And then the guy pulls over and jumps 

403
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:13,551
out of the cat.
Yes,

404
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:15,320
there's coming at me and I,
you know,

405
00:18:15,321 --> 00:18:20,321
I just used the inside control and just 
laid him over the top of the cab and it 

406
00:18:20,321 --> 00:18:21,690
was over before it started.
He gave up and just got back in.

407
00:18:21,691 --> 00:18:26,220
But thank God for basic standups.
Self defense also.

408
00:18:26,221 --> 00:18:28,080
Thank God for him that you're a nice 
guy.

409
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:30,960
Yeah.
Well sort of smash his face in nowadays,

410
00:18:30,961 --> 00:18:35,961
man.
You smashed someone's face and you're 

411
00:18:35,961 --> 00:18:35,961
going to have all sorts of lawyers 
knocking on the door.

412
00:18:35,961 --> 00:18:39,090
And if there's a video of it,
because was always a video of it.

413
00:18:39,091 --> 00:18:41,880
Now in the word disguises bro,
you got to go out of the house with like

414
00:18:41,881 --> 00:18:42,690
a mascot.
That's.

415
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:43,950
How do you do it,
Joe?

416
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,230
It must be tough to wear mustaches and 
shit.

417
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:47,970
Yeah,
I don't know.

418
00:18:47,971 --> 00:18:52,890
Street self defense is like la obviously
last alternative,

419
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:57,920
like you would most likely never use any
of the techniques that you learn if 

420
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:02,901
you're lucky you could live your whole 
life and never used any martial arts if 

421
00:19:02,901 --> 00:19:02,901
you're lucky.
That's luck.

422
00:19:02,901 --> 00:19:03,360
Yeah,
absolutely.

423
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:04,460
I always,
uh,

424
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,020
I,
I personally like to run,

425
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:10,890
not because I think running is such a 
good workout.

426
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:14,760
I like to run for the skill of running 
because if you don't run,

427
00:19:14,761 --> 00:19:15,570
you're not good at running.

428
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,470
Most people don't like it.
I,

429
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:20,430
I do it more as a martial art because I 
have a,

430
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:23,220
I want to run away.
But when you run,

431
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,870
do you know,
people can't run,

432
00:19:24,871 --> 00:19:26,460
you know,
you see the way most people move.

433
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,060
I don't want to be one of those,
you know,

434
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:28,800
mid,
60,

435
00:19:28,801 --> 00:19:30,540
70 year old guys that,
you know,

436
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:33,600
you can't run.
So I practice sprints at least once,

437
00:19:33,601 --> 00:19:37,380
sometimes twice a week just for the 
skill of being able to run fast.

438
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,460
Sprints are really good for your system 
too,

439
00:19:41,461 --> 00:19:42,170
right?
You're in,

440
00:19:42,171 --> 00:19:44,430
it can be systemic was,
you know,

441
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,110
it was a real interesting study done in 
running.

442
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,530
They found that people that run in the 
zone that like do 10 ks,

443
00:19:49,531 --> 00:19:50,370
five k,
you know,

444
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:53,320
competitive running marathons,
triathlons,

445
00:19:53,321 --> 00:19:57,240
and such actually a shorter life 
expectancy than people that don't run at

446
00:19:57,241 --> 00:20:02,241
all.
When I was really surprised they claim 

447
00:20:02,241 --> 00:20:02,241
it's the oxidative stress.

448
00:20:02,241 --> 00:20:05,040
My theory is people don't use the long 
apparatus properly embraced properly.

449
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:10,830
They found that people that lived all of
them were the people that run real slow,

450
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:14,850
just nice measurably like zen running.
They they live longest.

451
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,290
They live longest.
Well,

452
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:21,530
if you ever heard of the theory that 
there's only a certain amount of 

453
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:21,530
heartbeats that you get in your life.
I have heard that.

454
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:23,370
Yeah,
I mean a kind of almost makes sense.

455
00:20:23,371 --> 00:20:26,460
When you look at the age of professional
athletes,

456
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,860
like how they die young,
they burn,

457
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:31,500
they flame out in time pretty young.
Yeah.

458
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:36,980
No,
that's something that you have been 

459
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,721
really a pioneer in avoiding like 
keeping your body healthy like deep into

460
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:42,420
your sixties and seventies and I know 
you have a whole program about that,

461
00:20:42,421 --> 00:20:44,430
about with Brazilian Jujitsu.
He has.

462
00:20:44,431 --> 00:20:46,650
I do a,
we call it just it for a lifetime.

463
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:47,880
We're actually going to do a,
uh,

464
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:51,460
a training camp this next spring in 
April in Maui.

465
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,760
Hey,
how would you like to come?

466
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:57,960
I would love to have as my guest.
I would like to,

467
00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:59,200
but I'm busy as fuck,
dude.

468
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,370
Man.
It's just hard.

469
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:03,100
It's hard for me.
Just just tell these guys,

470
00:21:03,101 --> 00:21:08,101
hey,
I'm just taking a week off and gone to 

471
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:08,320
Maui is hard.
I would have to,

472
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:13,380
you know,
it's like my time off is most of the 

473
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,350
time if I actually have actual time off,
I spent it with my family.

474
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,120
Well,
bring your wife,

475
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:17,950
bring your wife and you're a young 
diving.

476
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:23,010
Maybe they would love it.
They can take a paddleboard lessons 

477
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:24,010
while you come up and paddle board 
lessons.

478
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:24,770
I do,
man,

479
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:25,870
always nice.
But man,

480
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:28,060
every time I'm there somebody gets bit 
by a shark.

481
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:32,260
Don't know what the fuck is going on 
that have that big fear.

482
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,990
Ever since I saw that movie jaws,
it's like,

483
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,930
forget at bed while we're there and 
we're watching TV.

484
00:21:37,931 --> 00:21:42,520
And there was a newscast a about this 
kid who got his leg mauled and uh,

485
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:45,250
my,
my kids were just in the pool or just in

486
00:21:45,251 --> 00:21:45,550
the,
uh,

487
00:21:45,551 --> 00:21:48,580
the ocean rather that day we were just 
snorkeling.

488
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,700
And then we came back and we were 
watching this thing about the surfer who

489
00:21:51,701 --> 00:21:54,820
just got mangled and you know,
they had them all stitched up and he was

490
00:21:54,821 --> 00:21:57,250
fucked up.
It's just such a primal fear.

491
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:00,370
I don't know what it is.
I know it's irrational because my chance

492
00:22:00,371 --> 00:22:04,640
of being eaten by a shark is way less 
than being an accident in a car.

493
00:22:04,641 --> 00:22:05,170
And I,
you know,

494
00:22:05,171 --> 00:22:07,630
I rent cars and drop.
People always say that,

495
00:22:07,631 --> 00:22:10,480
but that doesn't make me feel any better
because the also,

496
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:13,270
the odds of you being eaten by a shark 
when you're on the shore,

497
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,610
radically decreased.

498
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:17,440
That's true.
If you ever go to the ocean,

499
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:21,460
there's zero ads increase when you get 
in the water.

500
00:22:21,461 --> 00:22:24,040
So if you don't go in the water,
you won't get bit by a shark.

501
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:25,640
That's just a fact.
When I go to the,

502
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:29,800
what does,
this is a sunset beach,

503
00:22:29,801 --> 00:22:31,810
I believe is what it's called,
which is just south of La.

504
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,000
Oh Christ.
What are you going to show me?

505
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:36,190
Reaches the water.
Seal it.

506
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:37,660
Oh No,
definitely not.

507
00:22:37,661 --> 00:22:42,661
Going back right off a Huntington beach.
Oh my God.

508
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:47,280
This is insane.
That is one big ass shark.

509
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:52,320
That's got to be bigger than eight feet 
because it just randomly caught it 

510
00:22:52,931 --> 00:22:54,160
because they were doing some other 
stuff,

511
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:57,340
so he was filming something else and the
thing just breached the water.

512
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,570
Oh my God.
Show that again.

513
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,330
Could you imagine the fucking size of 
that thing?

514
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,040
Dude,
that's a big shark.

515
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:07,450
That's not a seven foot shark.
Now imagine some kid on a surf board and

516
00:23:07,451 --> 00:23:11,620
it just comes up underneath there and 
that's how they stunned as seals.

517
00:23:11,621 --> 00:23:16,621
If you've ever watched sharks hunt the 
way they hit and knock it kind of 

518
00:23:16,621 --> 00:23:21,030
unconscious most.
And then did you ever see the film that 

519
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:24,241
they put the that they got off of right 
off of fisherman's wharf in San 

520
00:23:24,241 --> 00:23:29,010
Francisco.
Some tourists were out there and they 

521
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:29,980
were just filming the water,
taking pictures of each other and seeing

522
00:23:29,981 --> 00:23:32,950
all these people hanging around by the 
water's edge and a great wife.

523
00:23:32,951 --> 00:23:35,880
Fuck this seal up in front of everybody.
Ooh,

524
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:40,980
like right in front of everybody.
And we think it was probably two 

525
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:44,011
different seals that are killed because 
it killed one and there was just like 

526
00:23:44,011 --> 00:23:45,410
this big bloody puddle.
And then it like,

527
00:23:45,411 --> 00:23:46,460
it got ahold of a second one.

528
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:51,460
It's hard to tell because you know,
you're just looking at the surface of 

529
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,921
the water,
but massive red and I mean these people 

530
00:23:53,921 --> 00:23:56,881
are 30,
40 feet away from this thing as it's 

531
00:23:56,881 --> 00:23:57,080
tearing the Sila part.
It's really pretty crazy.

532
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:00,340
That is crazy.
There was an awesome picture of a,

533
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:04,100
a Orca hunting with his calf,
a great white.

534
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,400
Oh yeah,
yeah,

535
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,520
that's a great way to.
Yeah,

536
00:24:07,521 --> 00:24:10,050
they,
it stunted and use Jujitsu.

537
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,620
Man.
It basically grabbed and turned it over.

538
00:24:12,621 --> 00:24:14,830
And if sharks don't keep moving,
they basically dropped,

539
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:18,110
held it till it basically drowned.
And then at eight,

540
00:24:18,111 --> 00:24:20,090
it's liver and the,
the,

541
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:22,010
uh,
the people that analyze the video,

542
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:25,490
uh,
felt that the mother a orco was teaching

543
00:24:25,491 --> 00:24:26,580
the baby how to,
uh,

544
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,400
how to hunt.
How to kill a shark.

545
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,130
Yeah,
sure.

546
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:33,470
They're not nearly as agile as an Orca.
Nowhere near as smart.

547
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,730
I mean,
they're really dumb.

548
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,610
They have a tiny brain that just eat and
swim around.

549
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:39,260
But um,
the uh,

550
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,510
because when you see that video,
he,

551
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:46,540
when he flip it up upside down,
something about flipping a shark upside 

552
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:47,540
down also kinda like knocks it out.
Yeah.

553
00:24:47,541 --> 00:24:48,860
They just go passive.
Yeah.

554
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:50,360
I've seen people actually do it,
you know,

555
00:24:50,361 --> 00:24:53,120
like in shows and stuff where they'll 
just take and just flip it and rub.

556
00:24:53,121 --> 00:24:55,430
It's bizarre.
That's pretty bizarre.

557
00:24:55,431 --> 00:25:00,431
But there's a lot of weird like flaws in
God's early designs and it's almost like

558
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:04,190
the designs like that,
like the design of a shark.

559
00:25:04,191 --> 00:25:05,730
It's like what?
It has to keep swimming.

560
00:25:05,731 --> 00:25:06,470
It's just.
So here's,

561
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,540
here's that footage off of San Francisco
is though,

562
00:25:08,541 --> 00:25:11,300
this is a different one.
Is it?

563
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:12,380
Well,
why is it so close?

564
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:15,020
This is a little bit later into.
As it got closer,

565
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,600
it starts off a little farther away.
Oh,

566
00:25:17,601 --> 00:25:18,350
I see.
Okay.

567
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:23,650
Now let's go further with them because 
the further away you get to see it back 

568
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:26,510
it up from the beginning because you see
that this isn't the one though,

569
00:25:26,511 --> 00:25:27,290
Jamie.
Really?

570
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,160
Yeah.
The other one.

571
00:25:28,161 --> 00:25:30,980
It's from a distance and you actually 
see the shark.

572
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:34,490
The rkv.
Well,

573
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:35,180
which one is this?
Jamie?

574
00:25:35,181 --> 00:25:38,300
He's just a shark attack.
This is the shark eating seal.

575
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:41,870
This is right off of fisherman's wharf 
where all the restaurants are.

576
00:25:41,871 --> 00:25:43,070
People are walking around.

577
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:46,170
Yeah.
See,

578
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:47,810
okay.
So more than one.

579
00:25:47,811 --> 00:25:52,811
Great white too,
but there's more than one footage of 

580
00:25:52,811 --> 00:25:56,171
this apparently.
Obviously this is a big deal and 

581
00:25:56,171 --> 00:25:56,171
everybody has a phone too,
but to be watching this.

582
00:25:56,171 --> 00:25:57,050
I mean these look at that.
That's like,

583
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,810
what is that?
Thirty feet asked Brittany and chance,

584
00:25:59,811 --> 00:26:01,040
man.
Yeah.

585
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:03,350
There's a better footage though,
a different angle,

586
00:26:03,351 --> 00:26:08,351
which is a little bit further off where 
you actually see the shark breach the 

587
00:26:08,351 --> 00:26:09,140
water with a seal and it's mouth.
It's like,

588
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,570
Eh,
I think I'll stay on shore.

589
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:13,430
No,
Nick Diaz,

590
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:16,850
he swam from Alcatraz five different 
times,

591
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,790
five different times.
That guy swam from Alcatraz to shore,

592
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:21,380
but you know,
what am i.

593
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:26,380
One of my heroes,
Jacquelyn lane used to swim that while 

594
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:26,380
pulling a boat full of people.
Wow.

595
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,320
Shackled.
Yeah,

596
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:31,220
and like as an annual birthday event.
What a man.

597
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:34,310
He's an animal.
I like the guy was still doing all sorts

598
00:26:34,311 --> 00:26:36,560
of crazy exercises right up into his 
nineties.

599
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:42,150
Yeah.
He was a crazy man who really a real 

600
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:44,130
pioneer of health and fitness,
health wellness and juicing

601
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:46,030
and he got into Jersey.
You know,

602
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,720
I always tell these kids,
you know,

603
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,890
don't be listened to these trainers in 
their twenties to thirties or even their

604
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:53,340
forties because they haven't been over 
to the other side.

605
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:56,100
They don't know what sustainable.
They don't know.

606
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:57,080
You know,
they,

607
00:26:57,130 --> 00:26:59,400
they just don't have that longterm 
experience.

608
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,520
All my mentors were guys in the 
eighties.

609
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:07,850
They're the guys I want to learn from 
guys that went to the other side that 

610
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:09,090
are super fit,
really healthy.

611
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:10,230
You know,
they're,

612
00:27:10,231 --> 00:27:11,740
they're the guys I've been looking at,
you know,

613
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:16,820
to put my own program together.
I don't want to listen to these young 

614
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:16,830
guys.
They have no fucking idea,

615
00:27:16,831 --> 00:27:18,000
man.
I didn't.

616
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:23,120
I was a lot of the shit I did when I was
even in my forties and even early 

617
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:23,840
fifties.
I look at him.

618
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:25,590
Yeah,
there were people he would tow,

619
00:27:25,591 --> 00:27:29,820
not just a boat,
tow seven boats or something crazy.

620
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,860
I mean like 70 people.
He,

621
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:35,340
I think he told like a person for every 
year of his life.

622
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:40,320
So here he's towing like a whole stream 
of boats,

623
00:27:40,321 --> 00:27:44,700
like how many boats were back there?
The guy was an amazing swimmer.

624
00:27:44,701 --> 00:27:47,810
That water was cold and it doesn't look 
to me like he has a wetsuit on it.

625
00:27:47,811 --> 00:27:50,400
It looks like he may just have like a,
a singlet type.

626
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:53,340
It's hard to tell.
It looks like there's a wetsuit.

627
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:57,270
It's harder though,
but either way the savage.

628
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:02,360
That guy was amazing fitness guy.
There is and he's handcuffed.

629
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:08,010
Pretty amazing.
Yeah.

630
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:10,050
Here's a guy that stood the test of 
time.

631
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:12,240
He had gone to his eighties and 
nineties.

632
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:14,610
Another guy was a master,
Elliot Gracie.

633
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:19,870
I made that guy.
I actually had a Jujitsu with a lesson 

634
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:19,870
with the guy,
you know,

635
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:20,550
when he was in his late eighties.
Wow.

636
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:22,440
And you know,
okay,

637
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:24,330
he's not going to beat anybody.
Right.

638
00:28:24,331 --> 00:28:29,331
Doing competitive just.
But you wouldn't want to go up and mess 

639
00:28:29,331 --> 00:28:29,331
with that old guy.
He,

640
00:28:29,331 --> 00:28:30,270
he would,
he would mess you up.

641
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,610
He had some thick ass hands,
big hands,

642
00:28:32,611 --> 00:28:34,110
big forearms,
and he,

643
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:35,250
you know,
he,

644
00:28:35,251 --> 00:28:40,251
he would just slap it on you.
I used to hate to be the guy that he 

645
00:28:40,251 --> 00:28:41,490
demonstrated stuff on because he would 
just really put it on you.

646
00:28:41,491 --> 00:28:43,440
I felt damn near injured,
you know?

647
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:47,140
Yeah.
Well he was a pioneer of no holds barred

648
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:49,800
fights like way back in the day.

649
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:52,050
I mean,
he was doing that in the 19 forties,

650
00:28:52,051 --> 00:28:52,890
right?
Yeah.

651
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:56,310
And even before him,
his teacher,

652
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,220
he didn't learn directly for those guys.
Brothers did.

653
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:00,540
I was that guy a salt,
my Ada,

654
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,910
a little Japanese guy.
Uh,

655
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:05,550
he,
I had heard he won over 800.

656
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,890
No holds barred fight.
I don't know whether that's true or not.

657
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:12,950
Well,
it's like the Hicks and $400 dollars 

658
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:12,950
number.
Exactly.

659
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:13,170
But made a,
he did,

660
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:18,200
he did a lot of no hold bar type type 
deals and he was one of the guys that 

661
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,840
really,
really developed that a guard because he

662
00:29:21,841 --> 00:29:24,570
was finding that big American wrestlers 
and football players,

663
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:29,900
uh,
we're putting them on his back and he 

664
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:29,900
became deadly from the,
from,

665
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:34,400
from fighting from his bag.
He kind of specialized in that 

666
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:34,410
particular position.
That's so fascinating because that was a

667
00:29:34,411 --> 00:29:37,860
big part of [inaudible] game too with 
keeping himself.

668
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:41,040
I mean he was like 140 plus

669
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:45,100
when he was competing and fighting 
against much larger man,

670
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:50,310
much larger guys.
I lived with them for a month down in 

671
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:53,700
his ranch and tears office and I used to
get daily lessons and his favorite thing

672
00:29:53,951 --> 00:29:56,620
was to have you put himself into just a 
really bad position,

673
00:29:56,621 --> 00:30:01,621
like mad or whatever.
And they just basically defy you to do 

674
00:30:01,621 --> 00:30:01,621
anything to them.
And it's a,

675
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:04,120
it's a great game that you can play well
into advanced age.

676
00:30:04,121 --> 00:30:09,121
You know,
you just let the kids work on you a 

677
00:30:09,121 --> 00:30:09,580
little bit and just play defense.
And there was nothing I could do.

678
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:10,780
I mean,
he just,

679
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:12,790
you know,
he basically knew everything I was going

680
00:30:12,791 --> 00:30:14,900
to do before I did it,
you know,

681
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,150
he'd give his back,
you know,

682
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,080
let's let him out and you know,
he,

683
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:20,860
he basically,
his defense was just a superb.

684
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:26,100
You would have either had to use an 
unusual amount of strength or do 

685
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:26,950
anything or I made.

686
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:27,860
There was no full one.
It was,

687
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:32,890
but it may just put it that way.
Will Hixon you select guys start on his 

688
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:34,630
back with a full rear naked choke,
fully locked in.

689
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:36,790
That's how he would start.
It's pretty amazing.

690
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:42,170
I mean,
but if you could develop that kind of 

691
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:42,170
defense,
then if you're safe from there,

692
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:43,690
you say from everywhere,
like one of the big parts of Jujitsu,

693
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:48,930
I'm sure you'll agree,
is the ability to be safe in any 

694
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:52,291
position and the ability to understand 
what it takes to be safe in those 

695
00:30:52,291 --> 00:30:56,011
positions and the best way to do it.
Like Eddie Bravo did that when he was 

696
00:30:56,011 --> 00:30:59,191
training for or one of the big things 
that he did was he had people start off 

697
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:03,121
in bad positions.
He would have people start off mounting 

698
00:31:03,121 --> 00:31:03,121
them,
have people start off in side control.

699
00:31:03,121 --> 00:31:05,010
He never started out just facing guy,
you know,

700
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:07,330
we're,
we're two equal neutral position.

701
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:10,060
Every position,
every role started with him on his back.

702
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:14,290
Every role started with him in a 
compromised position is such a great way

703
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:19,530
to work if you're working with people 
that don't have the same skill sets as 

704
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:19,570
yourself.
For example,

705
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:24,870
Hickson was in America for years and 
years and years and he only had white 

706
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:29,671
bell blue about level guys to work with,
but this is the way he kept his sword 

707
00:31:29,671 --> 00:31:33,871
sharp.
He would put himself in these bad 

708
00:31:33,871 --> 00:31:33,871
positions,
partially closed triangles,

709
00:31:33,871 --> 00:31:37,030
maybe a parsley closed Omoplata,
uh,

710
00:31:37,031 --> 00:31:42,031
you know,
on the back with a maybe a partially 

711
00:31:42,031 --> 00:31:44,581
closed choke or whatever.
And then he just was just a genius as 

712
00:31:44,581 --> 00:31:45,190
getting out of those positions.
Yeah.

713
00:31:45,191 --> 00:31:48,370
And if you can show your training 
partners what to do,

714
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:50,680
you can actually make it more difficult 
for yourself,

715
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:52,660
for you tell them what they're doing 
wrong.

716
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:57,820
And I mean Hixon didn't just develop his
own Jiu Jitsu skills.

717
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,130
Obviously he had a lot of great students
as well,

718
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:05,160
a lot of great stuff.
And a black belt under Hixon to this 

719
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:05,160
day,
it's one of the most prestigious black.

720
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,490
Seems a,
uh,

721
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:11,390
I would say probably the closest thing 
you can get to Hickson is a so radio and

722
00:32:11,391 --> 00:32:16,391
I'm out.
The guy's unbelievable training with 

723
00:32:16,391 --> 00:32:18,431
him.
And we were talking about law school 

724
00:32:18,431 --> 00:32:20,161
man.
Luis gave me my very first private 

725
00:32:20,161 --> 00:32:20,161
lesson,
uh,

726
00:32:20,161 --> 00:32:22,150
add Hickson's old place on Pico.
That was before I didn't know that there

727
00:32:22,151 --> 00:32:23,680
was a difference in the gracies,
you know,

728
00:32:23,681 --> 00:32:25,690
when I was starting out and I was like,
oh,

729
00:32:25,691 --> 00:32:27,670
this is Gracie Jujitsu.
Okay.

730
00:32:27,671 --> 00:32:30,280
This is just like the UFC,
like who's Hixon Gracie?

731
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,460
Oh,
that's the brother didn't even know that

732
00:32:33,461 --> 00:32:38,290
he was the man.
And so Carlson gracie school was closer.

733
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,910
It was off Hawthorne,
like right off sunset.

734
00:32:40,911 --> 00:32:43,540
That was closer to where I lived by like
20 minutes and you know,

735
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:46,280
especially during traffic,
it was a nightmare to get down to pico.

736
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:47,560
So I was like,
oh,

737
00:32:47,561 --> 00:32:52,561
I'll just go to this place instead.
So I fucked up and stopped training at 

738
00:32:52,561 --> 00:32:54,410
like the best place in the world,
like I didn't even know,

739
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,180
but that's how it was when I first 
started.

740
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:56,660
Uh,
you know,

741
00:32:56,690 --> 00:33:01,690
I didn't have a clue how well,
I mean I just didn't appreciate how,

742
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:04,520
how good these guys were.
But I got lucky though.

743
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:07,520
Any given day I could have a lesson with
any of the brothers.

744
00:33:07,521 --> 00:33:10,310
They were one big happy family and they 
were always there too.

745
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:14,030
I got lucky though that when I came to 
Carlson's,

746
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:16,770
Mario Sperry was there.
Um,

747
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:18,770
Carlos by head,
toe was there.

748
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:22,520
I got to watch those guys roll.
I got to watch those guys compete.

749
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,430
Vito Belfort was there and it was when 
[inaudible] was calling,

750
00:33:25,431 --> 00:33:27,590
they were calling him victor Gracie.
Do you remember that?

751
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:28,580
I do remember that.

752
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,380
Yeah.
They would spell it with a k,

753
00:33:30,381 --> 00:33:31,700
like,
I dunno what happened.

754
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,130
They changed his name.
I really don't understand what happened.

755
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:39,330
Well,
I know in Brazil a lot of times the 

756
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:42,491
women are able to keep their original 
name so they don't always take the name 

757
00:33:42,561 --> 00:33:43,860
of their,
their husbands.

758
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,340
Well,
he was taking Carlson's name.

759
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:47,720
I mean,
he doesn't,

760
00:33:47,721 --> 00:33:49,790
he didn't.
Belford is his real name.

761
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:55,010
They're like,
he doesn't have like a gracie 

762
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:56,831
background.
He was taking mother than might have 

763
00:33:56,831 --> 00:33:56,831
been a gracie.
No,

764
00:33:57,090 --> 00:33:59,000
but there's some people that do that,
like doesn't,

765
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:00,290
doesn't.
Um.

766
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:05,040
Who has that going on?
Angela Gracie know someone.

767
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,430
Someone has that going on.
One of the men.

768
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:10,430
Has that going on?
Roger Gracie,

769
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:13,650
his father.
Roger Roger is what?

770
00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:15,970
His father's Gomez.
Yes.

771
00:34:16,410 --> 00:34:17,410
One of them.
Yeah.

772
00:34:17,411 --> 00:34:18,080
Yeah.
Yeah.

773
00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:22,800
So I think Caesar to Caesar have a 
similar situations,

774
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:24,220
so I don't know.

775
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:27,590
But uh,
I do know it's not uncommon for the,

776
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:31,040
a married woman to keep her maiden name.
That's interesting.

777
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,350
But um,
anyway,

778
00:34:33,351 --> 00:34:38,351
so like I used to see everybody called 
Vittorio Victor back then.

779
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:43,040
And like if you look at the early UFC,
I'm pretty sure I even call it.

780
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:45,590
I remember someone pulled me aside and 
said,

781
00:34:45,591 --> 00:34:48,640
you can't call him Victor Gracie at UFC 
12.

782
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:52,720
You can't call him gracie because Horian
was suing Carlson.

783
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:54,640
I remember that.
Yeah.

784
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:59,830
Like Horian was suing all the other 
Gracie's they couldn't even use their 

785
00:34:59,830 --> 00:34:59,830
last name.
Meanwhile,

786
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:04,301
Carlson Gracie is a legend,
like a real legend in Brazilian Jujitsu 

787
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:09,580
and mma,
and he was the guy who came in and beat 

788
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:11,060
the guys that Leo couldn't beat because 
Crawson was a bigger,

789
00:35:11,061 --> 00:35:12,260
tougher,
stronger guy.

790
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,600
I mean he was more of a bulldog 
approach,

791
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:19,810
which is why it was perfect that he had 
that pretty much to bridge the gap 

792
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:21,730
between Ellias young sons,
you know,

793
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,660
Elliot was getting a little up there in 
age,

794
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:28,880
you know,
and was starting to fail physically a 

795
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,050
bit and his own sense.
We're a little bit too young still,

796
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:31,890
so call us,
call us,

797
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:36,900
and Greg was like the one to defend the 
family honor up until the point where a 

798
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,130
Hickson and halls.
Gracie

799
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:43,160
got into the young man and he had a 
fantastic group of students.

800
00:35:43,201 --> 00:35:45,400
It was an unbelievable teacher,
a little boost.

801
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:49,260
Montay Mario Sperry.
I mean he had some really amazing,

802
00:35:49,261 --> 00:35:53,610
amazing students as well.
His ability to go out and recruit talent

803
00:35:53,611 --> 00:35:54,860
was just incredible.
You know,

804
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:59,900
he just knew how to do it.
He had an eye for guys that were going 

805
00:35:59,900 --> 00:35:59,900
to be really good.
Yeah.

806
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:04,041
He also had like a great family 
environment like that Carlson Gracie 

807
00:36:04,041 --> 00:36:04,041
team,
like they were very tight knit.

808
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:07,860
It said it's a fascinating time in the 
world of martial arts.

809
00:36:07,861 --> 00:36:12,861
If you go back and look at that,
the early nineties and what happened to 

810
00:36:12,861 --> 00:36:16,491
this [inaudible] Jitsu in America and 
how it just sort of exploded and change 

811
00:36:16,491 --> 00:36:18,060
the face of martial arts.
It really did.

812
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:22,320
I had my first experience in 89 and uh,
I just made up my mind.

813
00:36:22,321 --> 00:36:23,010
I wanted to learn it.

814
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:27,060
I went in as a NCAA division one 
wrestler.

815
00:36:27,061 --> 00:36:29,250
I had a really good record.
Uh,

816
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:30,440
I,
you know,

817
00:36:30,441 --> 00:36:32,490
I was like most wrestlers kind of hard,
hardheaded.

818
00:36:32,491 --> 00:36:34,420
Why do these skinny Brazilian guy's 
going to show me,

819
00:36:34,421 --> 00:36:35,610
you know,
and then I'm,

820
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:38,350
I'm tapped like a typewriter by Heuler 
and black hole.

821
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:40,470
My God,
what is this that he's doing to me?

822
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,740
I got to learn this.
And uh,

823
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:46,530
I asked Korean,
how can I learn this martial art?

824
00:36:46,531 --> 00:36:48,300
He said,
come out to torrance is the only game in

825
00:36:48,301 --> 00:36:49,530
town at that time.
That was true.

826
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:55,130
And I see you went from philly all the 
way to tour and train and I would stay 

827
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:55,130
for a week,
you know,

828
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:55,470
I,
I'd have so much money.

829
00:36:55,570 --> 00:37:00,570
I was a former school teacher and I had 
like a little retirement accounts set 

830
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:00,570
up,
you know,

831
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:01,290
some money set aside,
you know,

832
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:04,230
after I quit teaching and money I set.

833
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:08,710
So I use that to fund by Jujitsu 
education.

834
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:11,520
The meantime I had opened up my exercise
was a personal training gym.

835
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,350
I put some mats in the back,
you know,

836
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:18,860
and I would usually go and take like a 
thousand bucks and when I run out of 

837
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:21,630
money I would go back to philly again.
Says it was my business,

838
00:37:21,631 --> 00:37:23,340
I could just take off whenever I want 
it.

839
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:24,000
Oh,
that's great.

840
00:37:24,001 --> 00:37:28,470
Then I had matt it and it was the first 
gym of eastern seaboard.

841
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:32,790
I would just get all my old friends,
Philadelphia Judo Club,

842
00:37:32,791 --> 00:37:33,360
you know,
like Quito.

843
00:37:33,361 --> 00:37:38,361
Got It.
Just go in there and just work with 

844
00:37:38,361 --> 00:37:38,880
these guys and practice my Jujitsu.
And then another,

845
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:44,040
you know,
a couple months later I go back and 

846
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:44,040
spend time again.
Then I got smart.

847
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,020
I started bringing the gracies to my 
place and then they would stay with me,

848
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:49,440
stay with me sometimes for a couple of 
weeks.

849
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:51,930
Hoist actually lived with me for a month
one time.

850
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:55,410
Well I think boys in oil or they don't 
even know how schools anymore.

851
00:37:55,411 --> 00:37:59,210
They just traveling to seminars and they
find that that's more lucrative and they

852
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:03,210
get away from the hassle of having to 
pay rent and employees and all the other

853
00:38:03,211 --> 00:38:05,520
nonsense that comes with schools and you
know,

854
00:38:05,521 --> 00:38:08,370
they're just welcomed with open arms and
these weekend seminars.

855
00:38:08,371 --> 00:38:11,130
And I mean,
if a guy like hoists are heuler or Hixon

856
00:38:11,131 --> 00:38:13,620
wants to do a seminar,
like who's gonna say no going to say,

857
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:15,420
well,
that's kind of what I do to myself.

858
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:20,450
You know,
I just go around and show him the 

859
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:20,450
gracies up the fence.
And uh,

860
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:22,980
the other thing that I'm really into 
these days is just basically how can you

861
00:38:22,981 --> 00:38:25,770
keep your body still in the game?
Because I mean,

862
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,750
it is fun to roll.
It really is.

863
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:30,470
It's something that you can do into 
advanced age,

864
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:35,600
but you got to be careful and you have 
to be very careful with the preparation 

865
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,010
of your body and what are the.
What are

866
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:38,070
the keys to a person.
It's like,

867
00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:40,240
you know,
entering into their older age,

868
00:38:40,241 --> 00:38:44,600
what are the keys to maintaining the 
body's inelasticity,

869
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:45,630
your,
your,

870
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:47,620
your,
your strength and vitality.

871
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:49,570
Well,
one of the main cases,

872
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:53,380
joint mobility every single day you got 
to do some type of mobility.

873
00:38:53,381 --> 00:38:56,020
People get confused between flexibility 
and mobility.

874
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:00,490
Mobility has a connotation of strength.
You want to be able to voluntarily go in

875
00:39:00,491 --> 00:39:03,040
and out of the movement,
a given example,

876
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:04,030
a bang,
Bang,

877
00:39:04,031 --> 00:39:05,250
a grapple,
and Stryker,

878
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:09,370
I've seen your devastating kick spinning
round house thing.

879
00:39:09,371 --> 00:39:12,640
You do a one way that like the 
difference between mobility,

880
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:17,641
like splash a buddy would be,
you may be doing a split or put your 

881
00:39:17,641 --> 00:39:18,720
foot up on elevated surface and just 
holding it and stretching,

882
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:20,050
right?
That flexibility,

883
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:25,600
but lifting your leg up slowly under 
control and extending it out and holding

884
00:39:25,601 --> 00:39:27,490
it like the old Bruce Lee movie.

885
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:30,430
And that is mobility,
right?

886
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:35,610
So practicing,
moving through the full range movement 

887
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:39,420
regularly is extremely good for the 
joints ache,

888
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,210
you keep your ability to move.
The other advice I have these young,

889
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:48,610
these guys out there,
tap early and tap off and don't be a 

890
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:51,661
fool.
And this whole concept that you can't 

891
00:39:51,661 --> 00:39:52,210
tap to a lower belt that gets so many 
guys hurt.

892
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:57,660
I can't tell you how many purple bouts 
or brown bouts get really pod because 

893
00:39:57,821 --> 00:40:01,000
some really big,
strong or technical blue bag gets him in

894
00:40:01,001 --> 00:40:06,001
a bad situation.
They feel they can't tap and they'll 

895
00:40:06,001 --> 00:40:06,001
literally risk injury.
That's insane.

896
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:11,090
Yeah.
It isn't saying why in the heroin 

897
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:13,081
fortunate [inaudible].
I don't know how that ever started that 

898
00:40:13,081 --> 00:40:13,081
you can tap to Lord.
Well,

899
00:40:13,081 --> 00:40:15,250
the problem is if you feel bad about 
tapping,

900
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:17,530
that's one thing,
but if you get injured,

901
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:20,130
you're going to feel so much worse,
so much worse,

902
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:22,210
and it's going to take you so much 
longer to recover.

903
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:27,240
You like if you get.
If somebody catches you in and you're 

904
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:27,240
like,
oh boy,

905
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:27,240
this is tight.
You know what?

906
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:27,700
Let me just tap.
Fuck,

907
00:40:27,701 --> 00:40:29,200
I'm an idiot.
How did I get caught in that?

908
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:31,660
That feeling that you get is actually 
good for you.

909
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:33,550
It's good for you because that way you 
realize,

910
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:35,950
you know you can't just let your neck 
hang out there.

911
00:40:35,951 --> 00:40:40,951
You can't not defend.
You can't think about those potential 

912
00:40:40,951 --> 00:40:43,501
steps.
And I see in a lot of Jujitsu 

913
00:40:43,501 --> 00:40:46,711
situations,
I see when when a higher belt will go 

914
00:40:46,711 --> 00:40:50,350
with a very enthusiastic and the very 
ambitious lower belt,

915
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:55,800
they oftentimes disregard the 
possibility getting tapped and that's 

916
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,210
how they get tapped bore as some higher 
belts I've seen.

917
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:03,420
They've.
They'll roll with a purple belt or a 

918
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:05,671
blue belt or a wipe out and they'll roll
with everybody like that person's a 

919
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:05,671
Ninja.

920
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:09,390
So we'll roll with every.
Every single person like that person is 

921
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:11,691
like the greatest grappler that they've 
ever faced in their life and if they do 

922
00:41:11,691 --> 00:41:15,091
that,
not talking about like going hard and 

923
00:41:15,091 --> 00:41:15,091
being like really physical and hurting 
them,

924
00:41:15,091 --> 00:41:19,830
but being aware of all the possibilities
and being on your toes and being at 10 

925
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:21,190
at all times.
If you do that,

926
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:26,220
you're going to be fine or purposely 
just put yourself in danger positions 

927
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:26,220
and get caught.
Yeah.

928
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:26,400
Just,
you know,

929
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:29,920
just to practice.
But what I think,

930
00:41:29,921 --> 00:41:32,360
I think it was a horrendous boys,
uh,

931
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:34,460
either a henry here on one of those 
guys,

932
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:35,660
they,
they,

933
00:41:35,661 --> 00:41:36,170
uh,
they,

934
00:41:36,171 --> 00:41:38,720
they mentioned a,
a guy that worked in their school,

935
00:41:38,721 --> 00:41:43,721
a blackboard in his fifties who was 
really a down in the dumps over been 

936
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:47,660
haven't been roughed up by a bull boat.
And they were saying,

937
00:41:47,661 --> 00:41:48,970
well,
how old was the pool about,

938
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:51,590
you know,
and the guy was like in his twenties and

939
00:41:51,591 --> 00:41:56,591
he outweighed by about 30 pounds and I 
think they were the ones who came up 

940
00:41:56,591 --> 00:42:00,191
with the idea that like for every 10 
years of age and for every 10 pounds of 

941
00:42:00,191 --> 00:42:02,150
weight,
that's like the guy having an extra belt

942
00:42:02,151 --> 00:42:02,510
on you.

943
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:05,720
So if he knows how to use it,
I mean,

944
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:07,220
just a bit,
let's just say a big,

945
00:42:07,221 --> 00:42:10,190
strong athletic white belt.
It's 20 years old,

946
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:13,250
you know,
and maybe outweighs me by 40 pounds.

947
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:15,800
That's going to be like me fighting a 
guy,

948
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:17,840
you know,
like a much higher skill level.

949
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:23,320
What he,
what he lacks in skill and technique 

950
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,340
he's making up for with Hustle and youth
and you know he's not going to get tired

951
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:27,440
and strength.
Well,

952
00:42:27,441 --> 00:42:32,441
I also think it's very dangerous to roll
with people that are much larger than 

953
00:42:32,441 --> 00:42:32,441
you.
I mean,

954
00:42:32,441 --> 00:42:35,270
I think there's lessons to be learned in
it and I certainly did my share of it,

955
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:37,220
but man,
there's a lot of times Rowan,

956
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:42,221
with much larger guards would come off 
and your neck is fucked up or your back 

957
00:42:42,221 --> 00:42:44,390
is cracked.
Making weird noises.

958
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:45,590
It's like,
Jesus,

959
00:42:45,591 --> 00:42:46,610
is this really worth it?

960
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:49,320
Or rarely really tactical.
Yeah.

961
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:50,330
Well,
if someone's really,

962
00:42:50,331 --> 00:42:51,830
really technical,
then it's completely different.

963
00:42:51,831 --> 00:42:56,831
But if you like,
I could roll with you and we could have 

964
00:42:56,831 --> 00:42:56,831
a great job.
You want to try to kill me,

965
00:42:56,831 --> 00:42:58,800
you wouldn't try to crush me.
Maybe it's sweet being taught,

966
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:00,950
but you know,
the smart big guy.

967
00:43:00,951 --> 00:43:04,040
If he's rolling with the smaller guy or 
an older guy,

968
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,860
he's going to put himself on the bottom 
again.

969
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:09,320
Now that you swayed me or whatever and 
just practices defense in the bottom,

970
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:13,370
why would re way rather roll with a 
larger than me black belt?

971
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:15,440
Then I would have larger than me.
Purple Belt.

972
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:16,970
Well,
good point.

973
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:17,810
Yeah.
I mean it's just.

974
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:21,320
It also like if you roll with a larger 
than you black belt,

975
00:43:21,321 --> 00:43:23,450
like a or grace or something like that,
they don't have anything to prove.

976
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:24,410
You know what I mean?

977
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:27,050
Like they've also been doing it for 
their whole life.

978
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:32,740
They know how to do it correctly.
Like you can get away with so much with 

979
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:34,410
physical strength and explosiveness and 
and,

980
00:43:34,411 --> 00:43:37,850
and just wait and power,
but that doesn't make you any better.

981
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,740
It's one of the reasons why I always 
tell people,

982
00:43:39,741 --> 00:43:43,250
if you want to learn Jujitsu properly,
learn it from a little guy from a little

983
00:43:43,251 --> 00:43:45,970
guy learning from like a Barrett Yoshida
or a boiler,

984
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:50,980
Gracie or an Eddie Bravo.
If you learn Jujitsu from a smaller 

985
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:54,191
person,
you're going to learn like really 

986
00:43:54,191 --> 00:43:54,191
technical Jujitsu,
master Leo.

987
00:43:54,191 --> 00:43:56,270
His self defense still stands the test 
of time,

988
00:43:56,271 --> 00:43:57,080
man.
Sure.

989
00:43:57,170 --> 00:44:02,170
That's,
that's another thing that makes me 

990
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:02,750
really pleased to see that it's kind of 
gone full circle.

991
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:08,110
You know,
Jujitsu was kind of going the way of a 

992
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:11,111
lot of other martial arts,
like judo became like just a form of 

993
00:44:11,111 --> 00:44:11,111
jacketed wrestling really.

994
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:13,310
And you know,
taekwondo tank,

995
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:18,130
pseudo that they were at one point 
deadly martial arts,

996
00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:20,000
but now they're,
you know,

997
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,790
they're,
a lot of the bars,

998
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:24,170
furnaces has been lost in a lot of these
different,

999
00:44:24,310 --> 00:44:28,970
especially if they go Olympic.
But that was happening to Jujitsu,

1000
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:34,020
you know,
people are just basically shaking hands 

1001
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:34,020
and jumping on their ass and it was 
like,

1002
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:34,170
what,
you know,

1003
00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:35,970
and that's a fun game.
I'm not,

1004
00:44:35,971 --> 00:44:40,971
I'm not driving it.
I'm not saying that the guys are not 

1005
00:44:40,971 --> 00:44:41,070
formidable.
Athletes are amazing,

1006
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:42,830
but you know,
for the average guy,

1007
00:44:42,831 --> 00:44:44,880
they're never going to be really great.
You know,

1008
00:44:44,881 --> 00:44:49,881
they're just going to be so.
So they're doing it for fun I think is 

1009
00:44:49,881 --> 00:44:49,920
important that you back yourself up with
the self defense.

1010
00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:54,790
And I see now a big trend to going back 
to the origins of Jujitsu.

1011
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:57,240
The self defense has been really big.

1012
00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:02,400
Guys want to know the basic standup 
street defense and it was extremely well

1013
00:45:02,401 --> 00:45:04,640
developed in the old Brazilian Jujitsu 
it.

1014
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:08,730
It was very well developed,
gun knife stick club,

1015
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:10,680
you know,
all kinds of clenches.

1016
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:13,890
Defend yourself against the gods trying 
to ground and pound.

1017
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:16,620
It was all there,
but it was lost.

1018
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,100
It was last.
Well,

1019
00:45:18,101 --> 00:45:21,930
it is unfortunate when people were just 
trying to chase metals and win by points

1020
00:45:21,931 --> 00:45:26,931
and in doing so the they become 
extremely unrealistic in the actual 

1021
00:45:27,121 --> 00:45:31,530
application against a,
a fight or a fight or rather a who knows

1022
00:45:31,531 --> 00:45:36,531
what they're doing.
But one of the things that's really 

1023
00:45:36,531 --> 00:45:36,780
exciting right now is I'm Nogi 
competition.

1024
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,160
That's kind of cool.
Yeah.

1025
00:45:38,161 --> 00:45:41,200
And what Eddie Bravo is done.
Did you see Eddie Bravo invitation,

1026
00:45:41,201 --> 00:45:42,900
which was number six,
was yesterday now,

1027
00:45:42,901 --> 00:45:43,970
but I heard,
heard about.

1028
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:45,180
I heard some of the results in it.

1029
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:49,440
Sounds like a very good way to contest 
skill versus skill.

1030
00:45:49,470 --> 00:45:50,640
Yeah,
it's amazing.

1031
00:45:50,641 --> 00:45:52,560
What Eddie's done is he's figured out a 
way to.

1032
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:55,200
They have it's submission only,
so they go after it.

1033
00:45:55,201 --> 00:45:57,600
Right?
And but when it reaches a time limit,

1034
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:59,790
if it reaches a time limit and there's 
no submission,

1035
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:05,120
then what they do is they start off in 
compromised positions sorta like 

1036
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:05,120
wrestling.
You know,

1037
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:05,120
in wrestling,
one guy would start down,

1038
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:10,101
one raise position,
so in you have the option of two 

1039
00:46:10,101 --> 00:46:12,450
positions.
Either you take the back with over,

1040
00:46:12,451 --> 00:46:14,940
under just over under.
Not a choke locked in,

1041
00:46:14,941 --> 00:46:19,941
but just the back with the hooks in an 
over under or spiderweb control meaning 

1042
00:46:19,941 --> 00:46:20,220
a arm bar.
The other guy,

1043
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:22,770
the guy's defending the arm bar on it's 
lying on his back.

1044
00:46:22,771 --> 00:46:26,340
You're inside control and you have the 
arm hooked and your legs are crossed and

1045
00:46:26,341 --> 00:46:27,120
you start from there.

1046
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:32,540
And so either the person gets a tap or 
the person on the bottom escapes the 

1047
00:46:34,441 --> 00:46:37,290
position and then you count up the 
amount of time.

1048
00:46:37,470 --> 00:46:41,540
So you do it in like you.
I think there's three rounds of this and

1049
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:46,910
if someone taps than the other person 
has an opportunity to tap that to the 

1050
00:46:46,910 --> 00:46:50,661
person and whoever taps the quickest.
Like if one person taps the person 

1051
00:46:50,661 --> 00:46:52,320
within a minute and a half,
the other person does it in 30 seconds,

1052
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:56,370
that person with the 32nd person would 
win and if there's no taps in the,

1053
00:46:56,430 --> 00:46:58,760
I think it's three rounds,
three rounds of,

1054
00:46:58,790 --> 00:47:02,760
of the submission attempts.
Then they count up the amount of time it

1055
00:47:02,761 --> 00:47:07,140
took the person to escape.
So if one person escapes like 30 seconds

1056
00:47:07,141 --> 00:47:08,370
quicker,
you know,

1057
00:47:08,371 --> 00:47:10,110
then the other person that person would 
win.

1058
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:12,660
That's how Gary Tone and wound up losing
yesterday.

1059
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:14,250
What a fair way to do it.

1060
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:16,020
Yeah.
It's a smart way to do it too because it

1061
00:47:16,021 --> 00:47:21,021
ensures that you're going to have 
exciting situations because if two guys 

1062
00:47:21,021 --> 00:47:25,071
are just locked up in front of each 
other and no one ever gets to a bad 

1063
00:47:25,071 --> 00:47:25,071
spot,
you're not going to see any action.

1064
00:47:25,071 --> 00:47:30,050
But if a guy's on a guy's back and he 
has an over under and they start from 

1065
00:47:30,050 --> 00:47:30,490
there,
that's a dangerous spot.

1066
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:32,500
And so you're going to see exciting 
stuff.

1067
00:47:32,530 --> 00:47:37,530
So it,
it changes grappling from being this 

1068
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:38,710
thing that can really wanting to like 
polaris,

1069
00:47:38,711 --> 00:47:39,940
you know,
they had those matches.

1070
00:47:39,941 --> 00:47:43,480
What Gary Tonin versus some are Paul 
Horez great matchup,

1071
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,020
but it went to a draw,
you know,

1072
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:50,620
a j last name winter.
They want a clear cut winner.

1073
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:55,030
Plus it gives athletes a chance to 
showcase their skills.

1074
00:47:55,390 --> 00:47:57,030
Yes.
That's what people want to say.

1075
00:47:57,060 --> 00:48:02,060
They want to see the skill sets 
showcased and you don't get to see that 

1076
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:05,080
because sometimes these guys are so damn
good that they neutralize each other.

1077
00:48:05,170 --> 00:48:07,570
Yeah.
It doesn't always make for a great fight

1078
00:48:07,571 --> 00:48:09,370
to really good fighters.
I mean,

1079
00:48:09,371 --> 00:48:12,130
what you've seen this in the UFC many 
times you think,

1080
00:48:12,131 --> 00:48:13,270
oh my God,
this is gonna be so good.

1081
00:48:13,271 --> 00:48:14,770
And it's like,
Oh man,

1082
00:48:14,771 --> 00:48:19,771
this is really boring.
Because the guys just basically 

1083
00:48:19,771 --> 00:48:19,771
neutralize each other because they're 
just so good.

1084
00:48:19,771 --> 00:48:21,130
They're so good.
They cancel each other out.

1085
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:22,870
They can't switch.
That is a.

1086
00:48:22,871 --> 00:48:27,871
That is a problem and I think Eddie's 
come up with the perfect solution with 

1087
00:48:27,871 --> 00:48:30,730
this format of putting guys in bad 
positions in the last stage of the match

1088
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:34,030
and like a fun thing to compete it.
It's excellent.

1089
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:36,970
And it's on fight pass.
Now it's on UFC fight pass.

1090
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:42,000
So now you know,
a lot of people getting a chance to see 

1091
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:42,640
it and they put the videos on Youtube 
and all that child is at the pro level.

1092
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:43,630
Pretty much.
Yeah.

1093
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:45,040
Yeah.
Twenty $5,000

1094
00:48:45,041 --> 00:48:47,710
for the might be kind of fun.
If they just did like a grass roots,

1095
00:48:47,711 --> 00:48:51,720
then a grassroots thing just for like,
you know,

1096
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:56,760
amateurs to go in.
It would be great program about purple 

1097
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:57,520
bound a brown.
I don't know how agree.

1098
00:48:57,530 --> 00:49:02,530
Yeah.
What the logistics of a tournament like 

1099
00:49:02,530 --> 00:49:02,530
that.
My Bay.

1100
00:49:02,530 --> 00:49:02,690
But man,
I'll tell you it'd be fun to compete in.

1101
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:06,490
Eddie's done six of them and they've 
gotten better and better and yesterday's

1102
00:49:06,491 --> 00:49:09,730
was the biggest one and especially 
because it's on fight pass now,

1103
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:15,180
but he's really figured it out.
He's figured out how to make this 

1104
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:17,050
exciting thing to watch where people who
were on the outside looking in.

1105
00:49:17,370 --> 00:49:19,000
Well you know,
speaking of that cast wrestling,

1106
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:24,030
a lot of people don't realize that pre 
civil war and just post civil war 

1107
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:25,840
wrestling was the most popular sport in 
America.

1108
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:28,990
Really.
People used to sit outside the telegraph

1109
00:49:28,991 --> 00:49:33,991
offices to listen to the results of a 
lot of these old school wrestling 

1110
00:49:33,991 --> 00:49:34,660
matches.
It was way more popular.

1111
00:49:34,810 --> 00:49:35,620
Well,
first of all,

1112
00:49:35,650 --> 00:49:40,650
baseball was in its infancy.
It was like a civil war era sport that 

1113
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:44,401
was invented.
A basketball was still only like two 

1114
00:49:44,401 --> 00:49:47,881
schools.
I think we're playing it and they 

1115
00:49:47,881 --> 00:49:48,730
actually used real like peach baskets.
Really?

1116
00:49:48,731 --> 00:49:49,800
Yeah.
Oh Wow.

1117
00:49:49,830 --> 00:49:54,830
Yeah.
It was a physical education guy came up 

1118
00:49:54,830 --> 00:49:54,830
with a,
a way just to,

1119
00:49:54,830 --> 00:49:54,900
you know,
like a game.

1120
00:49:54,901 --> 00:49:59,901
So it's just a conditioning game.
Was the origins of basketball to 

1121
00:49:59,901 --> 00:50:02,840
football was Lakers and yeah,
of course I was like this big watermelon

1122
00:50:02,850 --> 00:50:06,550
and welcome ball.
But wrestling was the most popular sport

1123
00:50:06,551 --> 00:50:08,680
in America.
And it was real wrestling though.

1124
00:50:08,681 --> 00:50:13,681
There wasn't,
it wasn't like catch guys like Georges 

1125
00:50:13,681 --> 00:50:15,680
Hacking Schmidt and uh,
Frank Gosh,

1126
00:50:15,681 --> 00:50:19,030
and you know,
farmer burns and you know,

1127
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:21,550
even up to the Arabs triangle to Lewis,
you know,

1128
00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:26,860
they were still doing real wrestling and
then of course they started getting into

1129
00:50:26,930 --> 00:50:28,520
more of the entertainment business.

1130
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:33,560
How did it go bad?
Because it's really fascinating to me 

1131
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:37,121
that wrestling itself,
it's such an unbelievably difficult 

1132
00:50:37,121 --> 00:50:40,961
sport.
Like if you watch amateur wrestling in 

1133
00:50:40,961 --> 00:50:43,601
the Olympics or Olympic level,
it's unbelievably difficult and it's 

1134
00:50:43,601 --> 00:50:47,591
exciting and fun to watch,
but there's no professional venue for 

1135
00:50:47,591 --> 00:50:51,881
it.
The appropriate well until the UFC came 

1136
00:50:51,881 --> 00:50:51,881
along.
Right.

1137
00:50:51,881 --> 00:50:54,521
But that's fighting though,
like for people who just want to 

1138
00:50:54,521 --> 00:50:54,521
wrestle,
they can't.

1139
00:50:54,521 --> 00:50:57,380
It is a great basis though for a lot of 
different things.

1140
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:58,790
It certainly is,
no doubt about it,

1141
00:50:58,791 --> 00:51:02,480
but it's just,
it sucks that there's not a professional

1142
00:51:02,481 --> 00:51:04,910
avenue for actual wrestling.
Actual arresting.

1143
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:06,940
I mean think about all the things that 
are on television,

1144
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:11,980
golf or whatever.
There's this massive professional venue 

1145
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:15,851
for it.
It sounds like Eddie Bravo that was 

1146
00:51:15,851 --> 00:51:16,760
given one for Jujitsu.
Jujitsu is obviously very different than

1147
00:51:16,761 --> 00:51:18,860
wrestling.
I mean just wrestling itself,

1148
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:23,920
getting the pin and scoring points for 
take downs and all those different 

1149
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:23,920
things.

1150
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:24,710
I mean there's something to be said for 
that as a sport.

1151
00:51:24,870 --> 00:51:29,870
Maybe not the best as a martial arts for
completing a fight,

1152
00:51:30,021 --> 00:51:35,021
for finishing a fight,
wrestling with the rules that are 

1153
00:51:35,021 --> 00:51:37,421
involved in amateur wrestling,
but to me the guys who get really great 

1154
00:51:37,421 --> 00:51:41,831
at wrestling,
like I would like to see them have a 

1155
00:51:41,831 --> 00:51:44,861
professional avenue,
like a way to go from college and then 

1156
00:51:44,861 --> 00:51:49,001
compete as a professional wrestler.
And so now there's anything wrong with 

1157
00:51:49,001 --> 00:51:53,021
wwe if you're into that shit.
But I would love it if it was an actual 

1158
00:51:53,021 --> 00:51:53,370
competition,
you know,

1159
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:56,870
actual real honest to God not 
choreographed,

1160
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:58,730
nothing thrown.
They uh,

1161
00:51:58,731 --> 00:52:03,731
there was,
there was an attempt for awhile to 

1162
00:52:03,731 --> 00:52:03,731
actually come up with a professional 
restaurant.

1163
00:52:03,731 --> 00:52:04,040
Couple temps.
Yeah.

1164
00:52:04,041 --> 00:52:09,041
But it kind of fell by the wayside.
Could you imagine if that was the case 

1165
00:52:09,041 --> 00:52:12,011
with basketball?
If you play basketball in college and 

1166
00:52:12,011 --> 00:52:14,030
basketballs is like really like people 
watched on espn is this big deals in the

1167
00:52:14,031 --> 00:52:15,170
Olympics and basketball.

1168
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:18,050
But then when you went to pro,
everybody had a dress like a vampire you

1169
00:52:18,051 --> 00:52:20,480
through glitter onto the thing.
You know what I mean?

1170
00:52:20,481 --> 00:52:22,060
Like you have music.
When you introduce you,

1171
00:52:22,061 --> 00:52:23,780
you have matches in a cage.
People like,

1172
00:52:23,781 --> 00:52:28,781
what the fuck happened in basketball?
There are some countries where they 

1173
00:52:28,781 --> 00:52:32,501
actually do have rail pro wrestling 
based on basic,

1174
00:52:33,430 --> 00:52:34,330
uh,
not,

1175
00:52:34,410 --> 00:52:36,890
not essentially Olympic roles,
but like,

1176
00:52:37,050 --> 00:52:38,570
uh,
uh,

1177
00:52:38,830 --> 00:52:39,350
you know,
each,

1178
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:43,880
each country has their own little native
martial art folk style wrestling.

1179
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:46,610
Uh,
some of the African countries do this.

1180
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:47,890
It's a,
it's huge.

1181
00:52:47,891 --> 00:52:50,650
And in countries like Somalia and,
and uh,

1182
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:55,750
what was the other country?
I met this guy that travels the world 

1183
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:58,880
for the International Olympic Wrestling 
Federation and he,

1184
00:52:58,881 --> 00:53:03,881
he was just doing like,
just looking at all the different 

1185
00:53:03,881 --> 00:53:05,540
aspects of wrestling all over the world.
I met him when I was in Turkey.

1186
00:53:05,541 --> 00:53:10,010
I went to the Turkish national 
championships of oil wrestling.

1187
00:53:10,430 --> 00:53:13,010
These guys are all pretty much like 
professional level dudes,

1188
00:53:13,011 --> 00:53:14,250
man.
And uh,

1189
00:53:14,270 --> 00:53:19,270
this is the one where they were these 
buffalo hide trousers that are tied off 

1190
00:53:19,270 --> 00:53:22,961
at the knee and then they,
they basically just pour a bucket of 

1191
00:53:22,961 --> 00:53:25,991
olive oil over themselves and then they 
go out in a grass arena and they just 

1192
00:53:25,991 --> 00:53:26,220
wrestle

1193
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:29,850
and it starts out with like 50 dudes and
then you know,

1194
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:34,880
half of those guys lose and then they 
just keep going to like two guys 

1195
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:34,880
standing.
Yeah.

1196
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:35,310
Why oil?
What happened there?

1197
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:38,640
How did that go wrong?
During the Ottoman Empire?

1198
00:53:38,641 --> 00:53:43,641
They had a standing army,
the basically the Ottomans pretty much 

1199
00:53:43,641 --> 00:53:46,760
conquered the world.
So they had all these young soldiers 

1200
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:47,920
with nothing to do and these guys were 
getting.

1201
00:53:47,921 --> 00:53:48,800
It's the problems,
you know,

1202
00:53:48,810 --> 00:53:51,840
you got to keep young men occupied so 
they came up with this.

1203
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:53,970
But at the same time,
you know,

1204
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:59,030
these are ferocious warriors,
the you don't want your guys hurting 

1205
00:53:59,030 --> 00:54:00,090
each other.
So they came up with this idea of coated

1206
00:54:00,091 --> 00:54:02,490
themselves with oil to make himself 
slippery.

1207
00:54:02,730 --> 00:54:04,860
So you can go after each other,
you know,

1208
00:54:04,861 --> 00:54:07,920
like a rabid dog,
but no one really gets hurt.

1209
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:11,760
Wow.
And also it helps build t charts because

1210
00:54:11,761 --> 00:54:13,980
these guys were wearing armor and the 
freaking desert,

1211
00:54:14,350 --> 00:54:16,140
you know,
hundreds of degrees,

1212
00:54:16,770 --> 00:54:21,770
100 degrees,
and it really builds up a tremendous 

1213
00:54:21,770 --> 00:54:21,770
heat tolerance,
you know,

1214
00:54:21,770 --> 00:54:23,010
when you get used to training like that.

1215
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:26,550
So training covered with oil,
heat tolerance can skin,

1216
00:54:26,551 --> 00:54:27,240
can't breathe,
man.

1217
00:54:27,870 --> 00:54:29,370
It's pretty brutal.
Oh Wow.

1218
00:54:29,371 --> 00:54:30,390
Okay.
I see that way.

1219
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:35,420
So like you just like your,
your pores really can't sweat that good 

1220
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:39,210
hope and those guys.
And they were able to keep themselves in

1221
00:54:39,211 --> 00:54:42,480
tremendous shape.
Work on his technique.

1222
00:54:42,610 --> 00:54:47,610
One of the things they do is reach 
inside the pants and grabbed that whole 

1223
00:54:47,850 --> 00:54:51,390
and it looks a little gay I think.
But I'll tell you something.

1224
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:54,270
I actually put on the kiss but in the 
oil.

1225
00:54:54,271 --> 00:54:57,000
And I wrestled with the former junior 
national champ.

1226
00:54:57,390 --> 00:55:00,080
Dude,
he was almost breaking my ribs with the,

1227
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:01,260
with the lever.
Uh,

1228
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:06,340
he would.
He come inside the waistband of your 

1229
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:06,340
trousers and put his elbow in your 
spine.

1230
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:09,000
And the.
See the idea is to flip the guy over and

1231
00:55:09,001 --> 00:55:12,690
expose your belly button to the sky.
If you turn the guy over,

1232
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:14,820
you went,
he had with the guy on the bottom.

1233
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:17,430
This is a terrible look at it.
It looks a little Cherub.

1234
00:55:18,970 --> 00:55:21,540
He's like literally waiting.
Let's put it this way,

1235
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:24,060
would never fly.
Never fly in America.

1236
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:25,470
Well,
why is the,

1237
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:28,440
why is there a gap between the waste and
the,

1238
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:29,680
you know,
on the body.

1239
00:55:29,790 --> 00:55:32,220
It doesn't start that way.
Is this really tight?

1240
00:55:32,221 --> 00:55:37,221
But the oil over time.
But these guys are unbelievably strong 

1241
00:55:37,221 --> 00:55:38,480
and you can see the physiques and these 
guys are like,

1242
00:55:38,510 --> 00:55:41,580
oh my God.
And they are national heroes.

1243
00:55:41,581 --> 00:55:46,581
They're rock stars in their country,
but they're grabbing each other's 

1244
00:55:46,581 --> 00:55:46,581
packages.
No,

1245
00:55:46,581 --> 00:55:46,581
no,
no,

1246
00:55:46,581 --> 00:55:47,460
no.
There's no sexuality at all,

1247
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:51,120
allegedly.
And there's no way you can get your hand

1248
00:55:51,121 --> 00:55:54,240
deep in there like that and not have 
some shenanigans.

1249
00:55:54,630 --> 00:55:57,060
He's looking at his friend and going my 
whole hand.

1250
00:55:58,410 --> 00:56:00,030
You see how he's holding the,
uh,

1251
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:03,750
the leg and the pant that's used as 
leverage to flip the guy over.

1252
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:09,020
So it's almost like Jujitsu in a way or 
he's making sure that the guy can't get 

1253
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:09,600
away while he's got his hand.
Yeah.

1254
00:56:09,601 --> 00:56:11,160
Well,
that's part of it,

1255
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:13,980
but uh,
I'll tell you man,

1256
00:56:13,981 --> 00:56:15,000
this,
you can't have this.

1257
00:56:15,090 --> 00:56:18,180
I developed a keen respect for it 
though.

1258
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:18,910
You.
Oh,

1259
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:23,940
I get it.
Guys are definitely fly in a western 

1260
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:23,940
culture now.

1261
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:29,200
But you've done this before,
but these are strict Islam as to you 

1262
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:32,971
know,
and any kind of homosexuality is 

1263
00:56:32,971 --> 00:56:32,971
punishable by death of these countries.
So.

1264
00:56:32,971 --> 00:56:33,520
But you also know that that doesn't stop
it.

1265
00:56:33,530 --> 00:56:38,530
Like people that have gone over to 
Afghanistan have talked about men love 

1266
00:56:38,530 --> 00:56:41,611
Mondays or whatever the fuck they have 
over there where there's a lot of the 

1267
00:56:41,611 --> 00:56:42,160
mab.
A man boy love.

1268
00:56:42,490 --> 00:56:44,170
Yeah,
no super common.

1269
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:47,560
You know,
they have gay relationships.

1270
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:51,520
Like there was an article that was 
written about one of those gay websites,

1271
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:52,720
like a,
an APP,

1272
00:56:52,721 --> 00:56:57,721
like a grinder or something like that.
And then this guy went over to some 

1273
00:56:57,721 --> 00:57:01,830
forbidden country where some Islamic 
country and fired up the APP and it was 

1274
00:57:01,931 --> 00:57:06,931
just getting pinged left and right by 
all these gay dudes and trying to hook 

1275
00:57:06,931 --> 00:57:07,360
up your data.
That's forbidden fruit,

1276
00:57:07,361 --> 00:57:08,920
my friend.
Oh my God.

1277
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:10,340
How it is.

1278
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:16,230
I'll get up and put on a buffalo hide 
and wrestle,

1279
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:18,690
but that's about as good as it gets for 
me,

1280
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:19,210
man.
Yeah,

1281
00:57:19,211 --> 00:57:21,930
but if you were gay you'd be psyched.
I guess I was.

1282
00:57:21,970 --> 00:57:26,970
But you know,
like if you were gay and somebody like 

1283
00:57:26,970 --> 00:57:27,150
put it this way,
right?

1284
00:57:27,270 --> 00:57:31,880
Being a heterosexual man.
If a girl wanted to get all lubed up and

1285
00:57:31,881 --> 00:57:34,240
Russell and you could stick your hand 
down her pants,

1286
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:35,080
dude.
I'll be there.

1287
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:37,420
Exactly.
So matter of fact,

1288
00:57:37,421 --> 00:57:42,421
after the show up,
what's up with a tarp?

1289
00:57:43,990 --> 00:57:44,620
Nothing.
Nothing.

1290
00:57:44,621 --> 00:57:45,550
Don't worry.
Just lay it down.

1291
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:47,740
Grab the rollout.
The Vat,

1292
00:57:48,010 --> 00:57:52,120
the VAT of oil.
You're a Lulu lemon tights on those.

1293
00:57:52,121 --> 00:57:54,280
Uh,
those pants look like they're sturdy.

1294
00:57:54,281 --> 00:57:56,530
At least it looks like it's difficult to
read.

1295
00:57:57,110 --> 00:58:00,260
It took me 15 minutes to get them off 
that.

1296
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:02,440
There are so stiff.
They stand up by themselves.

1297
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:07,440
It's almost like armor.
And I literally had to oil up my balls 

1298
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:10,510
and my ass.
My thighs just slot in that thing man.

1299
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,090
Like yeah,
there's some things.

1300
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:13,000
See,
come on.

1301
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:15,490
This is not good.
That's called a waste track.

1302
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:18,190
He's actually grabbing the front,
like grabbing the Jujitsu belt,

1303
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:20,920
that's what you call it.
It's going to pull them down into a,

1304
00:58:20,921 --> 00:58:22,390
uh,
into a takedown.

1305
00:58:22,630 --> 00:58:25,000
It's called a cock holster in my world 
right there.

1306
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:26,010
Look at that one.
Boom.

1307
00:58:26,530 --> 00:58:28,210
Look at that.
That is a,

1308
00:58:28,310 --> 00:58:30,790
that is outrageous.
And he's lucky he didn't break his neck,

1309
00:58:30,791 --> 00:58:31,240
man.
Yeah,

1310
00:58:31,241 --> 00:58:32,440
for sure.
Well,

1311
00:58:32,441 --> 00:58:36,040
I'm sure when you're dealing with people
being real slippery like that,

1312
00:58:36,041 --> 00:58:38,890
that's part of the problem with actually
grappling with this.

1313
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:40,210
Hey my friend,
he's my friend.

1314
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:43,690
That's the core.
That's the version of like in prison,

1315
00:58:43,750 --> 00:58:46,270
they hold onto your pocket.
That's what it is.

1316
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:48,870
These guys looking at each other.
Don't know.

1317
00:58:48,910 --> 00:58:53,200
Girls will do unto us to do.
That's what they're saying in my country

1318
00:58:53,201 --> 00:58:56,800
there no girls,
we just throw it down,

1319
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:57,950
but it,
you know,

1320
00:58:58,450 --> 00:59:01,290
it is a very difficult way to grapple 
all jokes aside.

1321
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:03,490
That's really hard.
And in doing so,

1322
00:59:03,491 --> 00:59:08,491
like you,
you have to develop like you learn that 

1323
00:59:08,491 --> 00:59:10,400
about Nogi as well and especially if you
try to do Nogi with no shirts on.

1324
00:59:10,401 --> 00:59:14,080
And there's a big difference with bobby.
It was like crazy.

1325
00:59:14,370 --> 00:59:15,080
Uh,
the,

1326
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:20,220
the thing also about that was it,
it was very safe for the soldiers to go 

1327
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:20,680
full at it.
I mean,

1328
00:59:20,681 --> 00:59:22,910
what do you do with a standing army with
no war to fight?

1329
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:25,940
What do you do with the ball?
But at the same time,

1330
00:59:26,090 --> 00:59:28,430
you know,
you can't have him hurting each other.

1331
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:33,840
That was the,
that was the so called origins of the 

1332
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:33,840
whole sport.

1333
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:37,840
Yeah.
There was an NPR podcast on radio lab 

1334
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:40,220
about the origins of football and how 
football was created and that was one of

1335
00:59:40,221 --> 00:59:45,221
the reasons why it was so appealing.
It was like a way to compete in war 

1336
00:59:45,221 --> 00:59:47,270
without actually having war.
I mean he had objectives,

1337
00:59:47,271 --> 00:59:51,890
you have goals and instead of bullets 
and bodies got a football team wrestling

1338
00:59:51,990 --> 00:59:53,430
most sort of.
Yeah.

1339
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:55,990
And a lot of ways.
And in a way like if you think of the,

1340
00:59:56,300 --> 01:00:00,260
let's say the rugby scrum,
it's Kinda like the old shield wall,

1341
01:00:00,261 --> 01:00:01,040
isn't it?
Yeah.

1342
01:00:01,070 --> 01:00:02,960
When they,
when they formed the shield wall.

1343
01:00:03,650 --> 01:00:08,650
So I mean it's,
it's basically learning to work 

1344
01:00:08,650 --> 01:00:08,650
together.
Uh,

1345
01:00:08,650 --> 01:00:10,890
and,
and there is grappling.

1346
01:00:10,891 --> 01:00:13,380
You mean you're basically throwing guys 
down pretty hard to.

1347
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:18,460
Yeah.
I think whenever you have young men and 

1348
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:19,610
you have competition,
there's,

1349
01:00:19,670 --> 01:00:22,550
there's always going to be this desire 
to dominate.

1350
01:00:22,550 --> 01:00:24,470
Like young men always want to dominate 
other men.

1351
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:26,330
That's just always going to be the way 
it is.

1352
01:00:26,331 --> 01:00:31,331
So they figured a way to have these 
workarounds that are acceptable by 

1353
01:00:31,331 --> 01:00:34,670
society and then in fact it became the 
biggest port in the country.

1354
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:38,990
I mean team warfare,
like the NFL is the biggest sport in the

1355
01:00:38,991 --> 01:00:40,700
country,
but you know,

1356
01:00:40,701 --> 01:00:42,950
it's interesting is the early football 
days,

1357
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:48,020
you know,
you just didn't see the injuries like 

1358
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:48,020
you do now.
I made there would be elbows,

1359
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:48,020
knees,
shoulders like,

1360
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:51,521
oh,
he's like all tough boy sports where 

1361
01:00:51,521 --> 01:00:52,010
you're throwing people to the ground,
you're going to get hurt,

1362
01:00:52,370 --> 01:00:55,730
but you didn't get the concussions.
And one of the theories I had one.

1363
01:00:55,760 --> 01:01:00,760
And you don't see it in rugby or rugby 
union or Gaelic football or in that you 

1364
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:01,700
don't see it as much.
Not as much,

1365
01:01:01,730 --> 01:01:03,150
but you do definitely do see it 
directly.

1366
01:01:03,150 --> 01:01:04,880
Say it,
but it's not an epidemic.

1367
01:01:04,881 --> 01:01:09,881
Like in the NFL.
I think the helmet became a weapon and 

1368
01:01:09,881 --> 01:01:12,260
they start using the head as a weapon.
Yeah,

1369
01:01:12,410 --> 01:01:14,430
definitely.
And you know,

1370
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:18,170
to see what the NFL does now with the,
you know,

1371
01:01:18,290 --> 01:01:21,020
all of these lawsuits and all these,
all these injuries.

1372
01:01:21,050 --> 01:01:23,300
Did you happen to see a will Smith in 
that movie?

1373
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:24,440
Concussion?
Concussion?

1374
01:01:24,441 --> 01:01:24,980
No,
I didn't,

1375
01:01:24,981 --> 01:01:29,981
but I keep hearing great things about 
that movie out because I heard he was a 

1376
01:01:29,981 --> 01:01:30,320
hell of a job.
A,

1377
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:33,050
I don't know what they can do to 
mitigate it,

1378
01:01:33,250 --> 01:01:35,090
but they do have a new kind of helmet 
now.

1379
01:01:35,091 --> 01:01:40,091
I heard that that just came out.
That really reduces the sloshing of the 

1380
01:01:40,091 --> 01:01:40,250
brain.
Doesn't do that.

1381
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:45,360
Uh,
I think it's some kind of gel or 

1382
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:45,590
something in the helmet that like,
kind of like a soft kind of thing.

1383
01:01:45,650 --> 01:01:47,000
The team,
the absorption,

1384
01:01:47,390 --> 01:01:48,710
you know,
the helmets for.

1385
01:01:49,340 --> 01:01:51,650
So when he get hit your brain's still 
sloshes.

1386
01:01:52,100 --> 01:01:53,030
It's just like,
um,

1387
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:55,400
you know,
when you get hit with headgear a lot,

1388
01:01:55,430 --> 01:02:00,430
it doesn't really stop the brain and you
just take more hits because there's no 

1389
01:02:00,430 --> 01:02:00,950
surface.
It's not only that,

1390
01:02:00,951 --> 01:02:05,951
a lot of people think it actually 
accentuates the movement of the brain 

1391
01:02:05,951 --> 01:02:06,020
because the fulcrum effect,
like a fulcrum of they have someone with

1392
01:02:06,021 --> 01:02:10,070
his larger object and the head twists,
I believe they've take.

1393
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:13,010
Yeah,
there's a new helmet now that supposedly

1394
01:02:13,370 --> 01:02:17,930
is gel like that.
It takes the blow,

1395
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:19,690
but it saves the.

1396
01:02:20,330 --> 01:02:21,390
Yeah.
We're seeing in here.

1397
01:02:21,391 --> 01:02:26,391
Jimmy pulled up this video.
It says zero one believes it can reduce 

1398
01:02:26,391 --> 01:02:27,900
the chances of player sustaining 
concussion,

1399
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:33,260
and this is interesting because the,
the helmet itself sort of gibbs and 

1400
01:02:33,260 --> 01:02:33,390
expands.

1401
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:39,560
I would love to see that happen because 
I love pro football and I would be 

1402
01:02:40,321 --> 01:02:45,321
thrilled to see it that they come out a 
way that these guys can still play the 

1403
01:02:46,681 --> 01:02:48,960
game without suffering.
There's horrible injuries.

1404
01:02:49,150 --> 01:02:53,080
I agree,
but honestly I feel like the real option

1405
01:02:53,110 --> 01:02:57,250
is probably no pads.
No helmet was the same thing with mma or

1406
01:02:57,251 --> 01:02:59,890
like the original football in the US.
Well,

1407
01:02:59,930 --> 01:03:04,930
I think with mma,
one of the things that saves fighters 

1408
01:03:04,930 --> 01:03:08,340
versus boxing is that you really can't 
tee off on someone the way you can with 

1409
01:03:08,340 --> 01:03:10,090
boxing gloves,
with boxing gloves,

1410
01:03:10,091 --> 01:03:13,570
you almost can have no concern whether 
or not you're going to hit a forehead or

1411
01:03:13,590 --> 01:03:16,570
going to hit an elbow unless you have 
small hands or we can.

1412
01:03:16,571 --> 01:03:17,780
It's like very.
It's,

1413
01:03:17,790 --> 01:03:21,670
it's much more rare that boxers break 
their hands and MMA fighters.

1414
01:03:21,910 --> 01:03:26,910
But even MMA fighters,
I think they have an unrealistic amount 

1415
01:03:26,910 --> 01:03:28,900
of protection on their hands and it's 
just to protect their hands.

1416
01:03:29,050 --> 01:03:31,780
Like I still to this day,
I'll get interviews.

1417
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:33,420
I got interviewed after that.
Uh,

1418
01:03:33,460 --> 01:03:38,460
the,
the guy died overseas really recently 

1419
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:39,580
and they were saying,
do you think that they maybe should have

1420
01:03:39,581 --> 01:03:42,040
bigger gloves or maybe we should make 
people wear head gear?

1421
01:03:42,580 --> 01:03:45,160
The,
I think the real answer is no gloves,

1422
01:03:45,370 --> 01:03:50,370
not only no gloves,
no risk taping because I think that one 

1423
01:03:50,370 --> 01:03:54,241
of the more difficult aspects about 
punching someone is that your wrist 

1424
01:03:54,241 --> 01:03:56,680
joint moves when you hit things and it 
makes it way harder.

1425
01:03:56,790 --> 01:04:01,790
I mean,
you have to really concentrate to keep 

1426
01:04:01,790 --> 01:04:03,631
your fist completely tight,
make sure that your risk doesn't move 

1427
01:04:03,631 --> 01:04:07,500
when you make impact and you have to 
make impact with the first two knuckles 

1428
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:08,090
primarily.
Otherwise you could break your hand and

1429
01:04:08,670 --> 01:04:09,500
regional.
You have.

1430
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:12,840
Say I was one of the original vessels.
I told you this.

1431
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:18,020
I actually,
through my little bit of money in there 

1432
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:20,421
and um,
was voices a conditioning coach for 

1433
01:04:20,421 --> 01:04:21,450
those first three?
What did you have him do back then?

1434
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:26,520
I was actually trying to build his 
strength as much as I could because 

1435
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:27,990
Jujitsu provided all of the conditioning
that he needed.

1436
01:04:28,290 --> 01:04:33,090
He was doing a lot of work with just 
bringing in fresh partners and he wanted

1437
01:04:33,091 --> 01:04:35,490
to stay a Jujitsu purist,
although,

1438
01:04:35,550 --> 01:04:40,550
you know,
he used some kicks and so forth just to 

1439
01:04:40,550 --> 01:04:40,550
Kinda close the distance,
just closed the distance.

1440
01:04:40,550 --> 01:04:45,381
Faith the guy I make the make the guy 
wonder like what's he doing so that he 

1441
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:46,470
could get the clients and so he would 
smack guys to,

1442
01:04:46,530 --> 01:04:51,530
to open that.
You don't run the risk of breaking your 

1443
01:04:51,530 --> 01:04:54,231
hand in hand,
but in all those original UFC is the 

1444
01:04:54,231 --> 01:04:54,420
strikers all busted their hands a lot of
oversight.

1445
01:04:54,450 --> 01:04:57,030
I think three broken hands in that 
first,

1446
01:04:57,380 --> 01:05:00,030
that the first one.
Well that's realistic though,

1447
01:05:00,031 --> 01:05:03,210
and that's realistic and ground and 
pound would cease to exist.

1448
01:05:03,211 --> 01:05:05,850
Yeah.
You can't just sit there and tee off.

1449
01:05:05,910 --> 01:05:08,050
We can elbow people for sure just as 
much,

1450
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:13,280
but imagine hitting someone in the elbow
with your store at the top of the head 

1451
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:15,630
and so that that whole ground and pound 
thing would pretty much go away.

1452
01:05:15,970 --> 01:05:18,340
We'll just.
Reckless punching

1453
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:23,340
would go away.
You would have to have precision 

1454
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:23,560
punches.
You'd see a lot more open hand strikes.

1455
01:05:23,980 --> 01:05:28,540
You would see a grab was able to secure 
a holds if they can hold.

1456
01:05:28,630 --> 01:05:33,630
Yes.
I might be a boring for the subway 

1457
01:05:33,630 --> 01:05:35,380
because I think you would see grapplers 
when a lot of fights you might,

1458
01:05:35,381 --> 01:05:37,990
but I think you would also see a lot 
better Moitai.

1459
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:42,010
You would see people would have to 
develop their Moitai because you don't.

1460
01:05:42,011 --> 01:05:43,810
You wouldn't see any change in the 
weapons,

1461
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:45,580
the knees,
the kicks,

1462
01:05:45,610 --> 01:05:48,010
the elbows,
all would be exactly the same.

1463
01:05:48,011 --> 01:05:49,240
The only difference would be the 
punches,

1464
01:05:49,241 --> 01:05:52,090
so I think really high level Moitai 
practitioner,

1465
01:05:52,370 --> 01:05:53,440
they'd probably.
Yeah,

1466
01:05:53,441 --> 01:05:58,441
they'd probably have a really good 
advantage if they can keep the fight on 

1467
01:05:58,441 --> 01:05:58,441
the feet.
If the fight went to the ground,

1468
01:05:58,441 --> 01:05:59,710
you definitely see a big advantage for 
grapplers,

1469
01:05:59,711 --> 01:06:02,620
especially in securing chokes because 
you've tried,

1470
01:06:02,621 --> 01:06:05,050
I'm sure to do grapple with MMA gloves 
on.

1471
01:06:05,230 --> 01:06:06,940
It's just like wearing oven mitts or 
something.

1472
01:06:06,941 --> 01:06:10,410
Especially like rear naked.
If you try to get a rear naked choke and

1473
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:15,700
sometimes it's really hard to get it 
underneath the chin and so and 

1474
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:16,540
especially if you like pretzel grips or 
something like that.

1475
01:06:16,541 --> 01:06:21,541
It's possible.
There's so much you create a good solid 

1476
01:06:21,541 --> 01:06:25,950
two to three extra inches of space that 
you don't want with all the padding on 

1477
01:06:25,950 --> 01:06:27,760
the gloves and it just gets in the way 
and it's also,

1478
01:06:27,761 --> 01:06:29,980
it's easy for your opponent to grab them
and pull them.

1479
01:06:29,981 --> 01:06:34,981
Awful.
And while I'd love to see a return to 

1480
01:06:34,981 --> 01:06:35,320
the glove was mma.
Yeah,

1481
01:06:36,370 --> 01:06:41,370
it would be really interesting.
I'd like to see a leg somewhere where 

1482
01:06:41,370 --> 01:06:43,390
maybe on an Indian reservation or 
someplace where they didn't have all the

1483
01:06:44,290 --> 01:06:47,620
boxing is the reason why they put the 
gloves on the first place.

1484
01:06:47,650 --> 01:06:49,500
Sure.
The boxing commissions all one.

1485
01:06:49,950 --> 01:06:52,270
Well actually it was tanking habit,
you know,

1486
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:54,310
tank Abbott was the first guy to wear 
those gloves.

1487
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:57,910
Tank Abbott War,
the Chuck Norris MMA gloves,

1488
01:06:58,150 --> 01:07:01,720
which was before anybody had them.
I mean this was tank.

1489
01:07:01,721 --> 01:07:04,480
Wore them like I want to say like,
oh man.

1490
01:07:04,481 --> 01:07:09,481
It was like early,
early UFC because tank was a power 

1491
01:07:09,481 --> 01:07:10,750
puncher and he was smart enough to 
realize,

1492
01:07:10,751 --> 01:07:12,910
you know what,
I'll just taped my hands up,

1493
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:15,880
put these,
these small padded gloves on.

1494
01:07:15,881 --> 01:07:19,480
They're going to protect my knuckles and
just molly these dudes was that.

1495
01:07:19,870 --> 01:07:22,300
Was that before they went to the club 
tank?

1496
01:07:22,301 --> 01:07:23,560
Abbott was before they went through 
gloves.

1497
01:07:23,770 --> 01:07:25,810
The first UFC that I worked at didn't 
have gloves.

1498
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:28,750
I was at UFC 12 and they still didn't 
have gloves,

1499
01:07:28,751 --> 01:07:30,760
did not have gloves.
It was not mandatory.

1500
01:07:31,090 --> 01:07:33,490
It was optional.
Vituro wore gloves,

1501
01:07:33,730 --> 01:07:36,460
but he didn't have to.
I believe he also wore shoes.

1502
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:41,520
No,
he didn't wear him and those guys were 

1503
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:41,520
still wearing leslie.
He was barefoot.

1504
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:43,480
He wore when he fought vandelay.
That's him versus Tara.

1505
01:07:43,830 --> 01:07:48,830
Tara,
so all leg has no gloves but tank has 

1506
01:07:48,830 --> 01:07:49,650
gloves on.
Interesting.

1507
01:07:49,660 --> 01:07:50,800
Yeah.
Tank was,

1508
01:07:50,890 --> 01:07:55,890
I'm pretty sure a tank was the pioneer 
of wearing those kind of gloves and I 

1509
01:07:55,890 --> 01:08:00,541
think that they would call those.
I don't think they called them mma 

1510
01:08:00,541 --> 01:08:01,510
gloves back to him because I don't think
they had the term mma,

1511
01:08:01,780 --> 01:08:04,420
but the original gloves were century 
gloves,

1512
01:08:04,470 --> 01:08:09,470
you know,
central martial arts come from hitting 

1513
01:08:09,470 --> 01:08:09,470
the heavy bag,
the speed bag or something like that.

1514
01:08:09,470 --> 01:08:11,860
Yeah,
and that's what the design came from.

1515
01:08:11,890 --> 01:08:16,890
Like the design of MMA gloves didn't 
come from someone sitting down and 

1516
01:08:16,890 --> 01:08:20,441
saying,
we need the perfect glove for mixed 

1517
01:08:20,441 --> 01:08:20,441
martial arts.
Now they had.

1518
01:08:20,441 --> 01:08:23,680
They already had a model that was really
not really necessarily designed for MMA 

1519
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:25,640
and they just sort of applied into mma 
and it became the standard.

1520
01:08:25,970 --> 01:08:30,680
There's a lot of like really sloppy shit
that's in mma still to this day.

1521
01:08:30,860 --> 01:08:35,860
That shouldn't be there.
That's only in there because it was in 

1522
01:08:35,860 --> 01:08:35,860
there in the beginning,
the 12 to six elbow,

1523
01:08:35,860 --> 01:08:40,601
which I harp upon all the time because I
think it's so stupid that if you go down

1524
01:08:40,611 --> 01:08:43,850
from 12:00
to six on the clock with an elbow,

1525
01:08:43,851 --> 01:08:46,280
it's illegal.
Even if you hit someone on the thigh,

1526
01:08:46,490 --> 01:08:51,490
which is so stupid,
it's illegal and the reason why it's 

1527
01:08:51,490 --> 01:08:55,061
illegal is because the commissions,
the athletic commission saw people 

1528
01:08:55,061 --> 01:08:58,151
breaking bricks on those karate 
demonstrations that you can't do that 

1529
01:08:58,151 --> 01:09:00,170
you would kill people.
So that's why that's illegal.

1530
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:03,540
That understanding of that they weaken 
those breaks.

1531
01:09:03,710 --> 01:09:08,710
Well,
and also the reason why gloves are 

1532
01:09:08,710 --> 01:09:10,931
mandatory is because somehow or another 
they erroneously believed those gloves 

1533
01:09:10,931 --> 01:09:11,690
protective the fighters.
They don't.

1534
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:13,070
And so,
but not.

1535
01:09:13,071 --> 01:09:15,050
But knowing that knowing that you have.
I mean,

1536
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:20,080
I think if we got a room full of 
athletes and fighters and martial 

1537
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:22,580
artists and we all have the discussion,
we said let's just have a show of hands.

1538
01:09:22,581 --> 01:09:25,980
How many guys here think that the gloves
protect the opponent?

1539
01:09:28,900 --> 01:09:32,030
So everyone who knows everyone at 100 
percent.

1540
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:33,530
I think across the board.
I mean,

1541
01:09:33,531 --> 01:09:36,550
there might be a contrary enter to that 
would step in and say,

1542
01:09:36,551 --> 01:09:38,540
you know,
a personally I'd rather get punched by a

1543
01:09:38,541 --> 01:09:41,750
guy with a glove that no glove,
but most people would say fuck that.

1544
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:44,230
Most people would say bare knuckles,
probably safer for everybody.

1545
01:09:44,231 --> 01:09:44,290
Yeah.

1546
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:45,450
Involves effort.
Uh,

1547
01:09:45,790 --> 01:09:47,650
am I,
am I correct?

1548
01:09:47,740 --> 01:09:51,190
Did they not take the headgear off a 
Olympic box?

1549
01:09:51,191 --> 01:09:52,300
They did.
They did,

1550
01:09:52,410 --> 01:09:53,860
yes.
And I think that's a good move.

1551
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:57,280
I think you don't get hit as much when 
you not have headgear on.

1552
01:09:57,490 --> 01:10:01,660
I used to hate headgear sparring because
your peripheral would get screwed up,

1553
01:10:01,690 --> 01:10:04,930
especially kickboxing.
It was really dangerous because,

1554
01:10:05,290 --> 01:10:10,290
you know,
you'd get hit with a jab and you 

1555
01:10:10,290 --> 01:10:13,021
wouldn't even recognize the kick was 
coming because of they're coming over 

1556
01:10:13,021 --> 01:10:13,870
your shoulder until womp.
It's catching the side of the head.

1557
01:10:13,871 --> 01:10:15,850
It was your peripheral would get all 
fucked up.

1558
01:10:15,851 --> 01:10:20,851
He would,
it would close your peripheral quite a 

1559
01:10:20,851 --> 01:10:22,861
bit.
And I just always felt like I got hit 

1560
01:10:22,861 --> 01:10:22,861
way more when I had head gear on.
And you know,

1561
01:10:22,861 --> 01:10:27,571
it's interesting,
a little bit of boxing and that I did 

1562
01:10:27,571 --> 01:10:31,501
do.
I always noticed I always kinda had a 

1563
01:10:31,501 --> 01:10:33,770
dull headache after boxing with headgear
and when I didn't have the headgear,

1564
01:10:33,790 --> 01:10:35,080
I didn't have that same headache.

1565
01:10:35,210 --> 01:10:36,910
It was weird.
Even back then,

1566
01:10:36,911 --> 01:10:41,570
I could never understand why my head 
always hurt more after boxing with the,

1567
01:10:41,571 --> 01:10:43,870
with the headgear on.
Because your brain's squishing around.

1568
01:10:44,470 --> 01:10:45,070
Well,
no,

1569
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:48,070
but I mean at the time I didn't put the 
cause and effect together.

1570
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:48,920
I was.
No,

1571
01:10:48,950 --> 01:10:49,420
I,
I,

1572
01:10:49,421 --> 01:10:52,550
all I knew was intuitively I hated 
wearing headgear when I,

1573
01:10:52,780 --> 01:10:53,680
when I would train.
Well,

1574
01:10:53,740 --> 01:10:58,740
what's interesting,
when I've brought up this to people in 

1575
01:10:58,740 --> 01:10:59,470
high places,
they always have the same thing.

1576
01:10:59,471 --> 01:11:02,020
The public would never go for it.
The public would think it's too brutal.

1577
01:11:02,021 --> 01:11:03,740
People would think it's too brutal or 
no,

1578
01:11:04,170 --> 01:11:04,500
what if we

1579
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:06,900
created what if we created because we've
created something,

1580
01:11:06,901 --> 01:11:07,400
you know,
not,

1581
01:11:07,410 --> 01:11:09,240
not me obviously didn't have anything to
do with it,

1582
01:11:09,241 --> 01:11:11,720
but what,
what MMA is,

1583
01:11:11,721 --> 01:11:16,260
is we have a completely new sport over 
the last few decades and this completely

1584
01:11:16,261 --> 01:11:19,380
new sport is redefined the way people 
think about combat sports and fighting.

1585
01:11:19,410 --> 01:11:20,100
Right?
Okay.

1586
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:22,950
Well why don't we be honest about what 
fucking,

1587
01:11:23,010 --> 01:11:25,350
what's happening and why don't we be 
honest about like,

1588
01:11:25,380 --> 01:11:27,840
how come you can shin kick a guy in the 
face?

1589
01:11:28,290 --> 01:11:33,290
I can shin you in the face full blast,
but I can't punch you with a bare 

1590
01:11:33,511 --> 01:11:35,400
knuckle.
Do you know how stupid that is?

1591
01:11:35,610 --> 01:11:36,910
Because a guy like,
you know,

1592
01:11:36,930 --> 01:11:37,760
take,
you know,

1593
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:40,650
someone who's a power kicker,
like a Vito Belfort or something.

1594
01:11:41,220 --> 01:11:46,220
The amount of power they could generate 
from a kicked in that brush into your 

1595
01:11:46,220 --> 01:11:51,051
face.
It's so much more than anyone can ever 

1596
01:11:51,051 --> 01:11:51,051
punch.

1597
01:11:51,051 --> 01:11:54,090
I mean like multitudes more three times.
Basically it is a baseball bat,

1598
01:11:54,150 --> 01:11:56,940
but we don't have to wear Shin Pads.
How can we not enough to wear Shin Pads?

1599
01:11:56,970 --> 01:11:59,880
Because the public's not used to shins 
being covered,

1600
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:01,380
it's all it is.
I,

1601
01:12:01,470 --> 01:12:05,360
I really honestly think that the 
smartest move would be to ban tape.

1602
01:12:05,700 --> 01:12:10,700
Don't know.
You can't tape your wrists and bare 

1603
01:12:10,700 --> 01:12:10,700
knuckles.
I think such A.

1604
01:12:10,700 --> 01:12:14,780
Well,
if you go back in the early era of 

1605
01:12:14,780 --> 01:12:16,950
boxing where it was all bare knuckle,
you rarely saw knockouts.

1606
01:12:17,580 --> 01:12:18,960
There's,
there's fights used to go.

1607
01:12:18,961 --> 01:12:22,920
So like 30 rounds of all the,
you know,

1608
01:12:22,921 --> 01:12:27,921
like Jack Johnson and those guys.
Do you think that's why they used to 

1609
01:12:27,921 --> 01:12:28,650
fight like this to smack each other with
the knuckles like that?

1610
01:12:29,070 --> 01:12:30,330
Or do you think they just didn't know 
any better?

1611
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:32,000
I think they know better.
I,

1612
01:12:32,001 --> 01:12:33,640
I think,
uh,

1613
01:12:33,690 --> 01:12:34,740
the mighty men of old.

1614
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:37,260
There's not too much we could probably 
show those guys.

1615
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:40,530
Imagine if we went in at a time capsule 
back to Sparta,

1616
01:12:40,950 --> 01:12:43,170
the first professional army.
You're in Europe.

1617
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:48,880
Do you think we could actually show 
those guys anything about fighting or 

1618
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:48,880
warfare and fuck,
all those dudes up.

1619
01:12:48,990 --> 01:12:50,000
Send me back.
No,

1620
01:12:50,850 --> 01:12:51,570
no.
Honestly,

1621
01:12:52,020 --> 01:12:54,270
martial arts.
I bet they'd get fucked up.

1622
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:55,020
I really do.
I.

1623
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:58,770
Because when I look at the martial 
artists from 1993 that were competing in

1624
01:12:58,771 --> 01:13:00,870
the UFC,
then I look at the martial arts of today

1625
01:13:00,871 --> 01:13:03,150
in 2016.
Look at John Jones.

1626
01:13:03,330 --> 01:13:05,760
Do you know what the Fuck Jon Jones 
would do to UFC one?

1627
01:13:05,970 --> 01:13:10,970
I mean,
you know how ridiculous it would be if 

1628
01:13:10,970 --> 01:13:10,970
you send John Jones in the UFC one,
he'd be like,

1629
01:13:10,970 --> 01:13:11,190
get that guy out of here.
It's not fair.

1630
01:13:11,370 --> 01:13:13,020
Like he's doing a totally different 
thing.

1631
01:13:13,230 --> 01:13:15,780
I think the martial artists of today,
like Demetrius Johnson,

1632
01:13:15,781 --> 01:13:18,240
who I think is the best ever,
but we're still talking modern,

1633
01:13:18,241 --> 01:13:19,110
modern,
modern.

1634
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:24,200
Let's go 2000 years ago.
You put Jon Jones and the gladiator 

1635
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:28,311
arena.
Do you don't think he would fuck those 

1636
01:13:28,311 --> 01:13:28,311
guys up?
I think it'd be a hell of a gladiator.

1637
01:13:28,311 --> 01:13:30,270
Fighters would have a chance.
I don't think they would.

1638
01:13:30,290 --> 01:13:31,560
I don't think they would know what they 
were doing.

1639
01:13:31,561 --> 01:13:33,330
I think they knew what they're doing 
really.

1640
01:13:33,331 --> 01:13:34,370
Yeah,
I really do.

1641
01:13:34,380 --> 01:13:35,940
Um,
they didn't know in 1993,

1642
01:13:37,620 --> 01:13:39,690
a lot of this information had been lost.
Right.

1643
01:13:39,691 --> 01:13:44,691
But even Jujitsu,
which Jujitsu is a resurgence of old 

1644
01:13:44,691 --> 01:13:45,570
stuff.
Okay,

1645
01:13:45,571 --> 01:13:46,710
I see what you're saying.
What I'm saying.

1646
01:13:46,740 --> 01:13:48,700
It's like the dark ages,
you know,

1647
01:13:48,930 --> 01:13:53,930
where they are in medieval times,
but they didn't have the ability to 

1648
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:54,650
share information like they have today.
No,

1649
01:13:54,651 --> 01:13:54,910
no,
no,

1650
01:13:54,911 --> 01:13:57,270
no.
There's no internet or that's one of the

1651
01:13:57,271 --> 01:13:59,310
reasons why Jujitsu's at such a high 
level today.

1652
01:13:59,311 --> 01:14:01,170
Like there's all these like viral Bj 
Jay,

1653
01:14:01,171 --> 01:14:06,171
which is one of the ones I follow on 
instagram is a bunch when I follow on 

1654
01:14:06,171 --> 01:14:08,991
instagram where they'll have moves of 
the day and they show these moves and 

1655
01:14:08,991 --> 01:14:08,991
you'd just.

1656
01:14:08,991 --> 01:14:12,580
I've been doing Jujitsu for a long time 
and I watched something and I'll just go

1657
01:14:12,910 --> 01:14:14,140
like the home alone guy.
I'm like,

1658
01:14:14,141 --> 01:14:19,141
Oh my God,
look at this work and move like every 

1659
01:14:19,141 --> 01:14:20,170
day these kids are coming up with new 
moves every day.

1660
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:23,270
I saw somebody figured out how to go 
some.

1661
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:28,320
Some dude went from being in a heel hook
to catch in the guy in a Kamora and spun

1662
01:14:31,121 --> 01:14:32,950
out of the heel hook into a Komora.
And I was like,

1663
01:14:35,470 --> 01:14:38,150
what did you just do?
Like you watch you like how did it,

1664
01:14:38,380 --> 01:14:40,240
he just kind of replay it over and over 
and over again.

1665
01:14:40,390 --> 01:14:41,770
There's so many of those.
Now.

1666
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:46,970
Let's go back to what we were just 
talking about in ancient times.

1667
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:52,360
Your,
your ability to fight was a life or 

1668
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:52,360
death thing.
You know,

1669
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:55,490
you were actually fighting to the death,
right?

1670
01:14:55,730 --> 01:14:57,820
We don't have that true.
Unless you,

1671
01:14:57,821 --> 01:15:02,821
you know,
but usually in the military is with a 

1672
01:15:02,821 --> 01:15:03,600
shooting and guns and stuff like that.
You don't see guys fighting.

1673
01:15:03,710 --> 01:15:07,830
I mean it could be hand to hand,
but for the most part these guys were,

1674
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:10,910
were trained lawyers that would fight 
hand to hand.

1675
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:14,000
That's why I say when you're fighting to
the death,

1676
01:15:14,300 --> 01:15:17,270
you're damn good at what you do if you 
live,

1677
01:15:17,420 --> 01:15:18,080
if you live but

1678
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:20,490
don't live,
you don't get to really learn anything.

1679
01:15:22,850 --> 01:15:25,080
But there's plenty of guys that did.
Yeah.

1680
01:15:25,780 --> 01:15:30,780
And so my point is that they were well 
trained and they really knew what was 

1681
01:15:30,780 --> 01:15:30,920
going on.

1682
01:15:31,580 --> 01:15:33,950
I think there's some good points on both
sides.

1683
01:15:34,010 --> 01:15:39,010
I think there were certainly some 
incredibly tough people back then for 

1684
01:15:39,010 --> 01:15:39,010
sure.
Oh my God.

1685
01:15:39,010 --> 01:15:43,320
Yeah.
I'm sure the pain threshold of his own 

1686
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:44,910
belief,
but I think there's also this longing 

1687
01:15:44,910 --> 01:15:44,910
for nostalgia that a lot of people like 
to apply to,

1688
01:15:44,910 --> 01:15:48,110
like the ancient martial artists in the 
ancient fighters and they elect to look.

1689
01:15:48,111 --> 01:15:49,370
Oh those guys,
boy,

1690
01:15:49,371 --> 01:15:50,990
if they could fight,
you know today,

1691
01:15:51,170 --> 01:15:53,870
like if you could get this guy,
I Look Jack Dempsey,

1692
01:15:53,871 --> 01:15:58,760
who's a hell of a fighter and amazing 
boxer and just unbelievably tough man.

1693
01:15:59,210 --> 01:16:02,510
Wouldn't last one round with Mike Tyson.
Mike Tyson is prime,

1694
01:16:02,511 --> 01:16:06,260
would have ran through Jack Dempsey.
He would have ran through all of them.

1695
01:16:06,290 --> 01:16:11,290
He would have ran through gene tunney.
He would have ran through all those 

1696
01:16:11,290 --> 01:16:11,290
guys.

1697
01:16:11,290 --> 01:16:15,230
Course.
He rammed through everybody Iron Age 

1698
01:16:15,230 --> 01:16:15,230
too.
So.

1699
01:16:15,230 --> 01:16:18,170
But he.
Was that because he was mike or is it 

1700
01:16:18,170 --> 01:16:18,360
because those guys were really good.

1701
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:21,930
It was also because he had a lot of 
modern guys look pretty shitty.

1702
01:16:21,931 --> 01:16:26,931
He certainly did,
but he had the benefit of having all of 

1703
01:16:26,931 --> 01:16:29,670
those guys on film and see.
He had the internet when he had his,

1704
01:16:29,671 --> 01:16:32,470
his version of the Internet,
which was custom motto and cussed out.

1705
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:37,480
I mean,
it might not have got them on Reddit or 

1706
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:37,480
showed them all the funny memes on 
Instagram,

1707
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:40,680
but what he did do is he played him 
these films,

1708
01:16:40,681 --> 01:16:44,460
these black and white films of sugar,
Ray Robinson of Jersey,

1709
01:16:44,461 --> 01:16:49,461
Joe Walcott of Rocky Marciano.
He got to watch these old school Jack 

1710
01:16:49,461 --> 01:16:53,900
Dempsey tapes and he got to emulate 
their techniques and understand and 

1711
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:56,740
custom.
Ana would go over and meticulously 

1712
01:16:56,740 --> 01:16:58,761
different positions and different ways 
to encounter different styles and 

1713
01:16:58,761 --> 01:17:01,590
different ways to move to get better 
angles for counter shots,

1714
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:06,800
and he learned from all those techniques
in a way those guys really didn't have 

1715
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:08,370
the opportunity to do.
They had to train,

1716
01:17:08,371 --> 01:17:09,980
they had to learn from.
They had to watch other

1717
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:14,980
people do it,
but they didn't have the benefit of 

1718
01:17:14,980 --> 01:17:16,280
having a library of films made a very 
strong point.

1719
01:17:17,180 --> 01:17:18,800
Did you happen to catch them in net man?
Three.

1720
01:17:19,390 --> 01:17:20,410
What is it,
man?

1721
01:17:20,420 --> 01:17:21,680
Three know.
What is that mean?

1722
01:17:22,270 --> 01:17:27,020
You know the wing Chung guy was one of 
those crazy kung fu movies.

1723
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:27,500
Yeah.
Yeah,

1724
01:17:27,501 --> 01:17:29,050
but Mike Tyson had a.
oh,

1725
01:17:29,060 --> 01:17:33,230
that's right.
I saw the scariest shit ever.

1726
01:17:33,260 --> 01:17:36,050
Even to this day books,
Nike gets still,

1727
01:17:36,290 --> 01:17:41,290
you know,
if he just trained for a six months or 

1728
01:17:41,290 --> 01:17:44,261
so,
he looks like he's still step in there 

1729
01:17:44,261 --> 01:17:44,261
and take somebody out.
Well,

1730
01:17:44,261 --> 01:17:45,140
he definitely looks like he's still 
somewhat active.

1731
01:17:45,141 --> 01:17:48,600
There was a video of him hitting the bag
recently for some shoot for something.

1732
01:17:48,601 --> 01:17:50,020
You'd be dead.
And uh,

1733
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:50,720
you know,
he starts,

1734
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:52,790
it starts off slow,
starts getting loosened up,

1735
01:17:52,910 --> 01:17:54,470
and then he starts teeing off in the 
baggy.

1736
01:17:54,470 --> 01:17:55,410
Like,
oh Jesus.

1737
01:17:55,420 --> 01:17:57,170
Oh my God,
he's still fuck people up.

1738
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:58,760
He would still fuck people up.
Joe,

1739
01:17:58,761 --> 01:18:00,840
you would still fuck people up trying 
to.

1740
01:18:00,930 --> 01:18:01,760
We're still,
I'm still,

1741
01:18:01,761 --> 01:18:04,880
I still haunted by that spinning back 
kick you did in your garage that time.

1742
01:18:05,290 --> 01:18:06,880
You're freaking banana bag.
Bennett.

1743
01:18:06,890 --> 01:18:09,620
Half man.
My ribs hurt.

1744
01:18:09,621 --> 01:18:11,420
Just watching that man.
Well,

1745
01:18:11,570 --> 01:18:14,330
kicks are always going to be more 
powerful than punches.

1746
01:18:14,850 --> 01:18:19,850
And I think that kicking technique is 
one of the few things that is a little 

1747
01:18:19,971 --> 01:18:24,350
bit behind in mma in comparison to some 
of the traditional martial arts,

1748
01:18:24,770 --> 01:18:27,800
especially like the spinning kicks and 
straight kicks.

1749
01:18:28,490 --> 01:18:31,190
Round kicks are pretty simple.
It's pretty straightforward.

1750
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:36,400
If you look at the round kicks of like 
the best Thai fighters in the round 

1751
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:37,310
kicks of like the best Jujitsu guys,
like in Edson Barboza,

1752
01:18:37,860 --> 01:18:42,860
Barboza is right up there with pretty 
much anybody and as far as far as like 

1753
01:18:42,860 --> 01:18:44,730
kicking technique in the world,
but spinning technique,

1754
01:18:44,731 --> 01:18:46,680
straight techniques like it's turning 
side kicks.

1755
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:49,250
There's a little bit of lost knowledge 
in those.

1756
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:53,090
Not so many guys know that man that 
Sarah used to have that awesome spinning

1757
01:18:53,091 --> 01:18:53,960
back fist,
man.

1758
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:56,120
Wow.
That caught by surprise.

1759
01:18:56,340 --> 01:19:01,340
And am I correct?
You were the one that taught GSP that 

1760
01:19:01,340 --> 01:19:01,640
spinning back kick and he knew how to do
it,

1761
01:19:01,641 --> 01:19:04,550
but I helped refine it.
He actually came to me,

1762
01:19:04,551 --> 01:19:09,551
John Danaher,
who's like one of the best Jujitsu 

1763
01:19:09,551 --> 01:19:09,551
coaches in the world.
Who's.

1764
01:19:09,551 --> 01:19:11,810
He's the guy who was in charge of this,
what they called a doner death squad.

1765
01:19:11,820 --> 01:19:14,870
He's all these guys that have Henzel.
Gracie is like Gary Tonin.

1766
01:19:14,871 --> 01:19:18,950
Eddie comments to talk to the young man 
that one yesterday.

1767
01:19:19,450 --> 01:19:21,530
His name is Ryan Gordon.
Ryan,

1768
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:25,850
I think his name is who won a ubi.
Can you find out what his name is?

1769
01:19:25,970 --> 01:19:29,030
Young kid is 20 years old,
one the Ebi Tournament yesterday,

1770
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:32,030
but Donna and I were having dinner in 
GSP wanted.

1771
01:19:32,030 --> 01:19:35,480
Um,
he asked me if I knew anyone who,

1772
01:19:35,481 --> 01:19:40,481
um,
because he knew that I came from a 

1773
01:19:40,481 --> 01:19:42,101
taekwondo background and he's like,
do you know anybody who's a really good 

1774
01:19:42,101 --> 01:19:44,681
taekwondo guy that can show gsp the 
fundamentals of the spinning back kick 

1775
01:19:44,681 --> 01:19:46,430
her turning sidekick?
Yeah.

1776
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:47,030
Gordon,
Ryan,

1777
01:19:47,330 --> 01:19:48,620
young kid.
Twenty years old.

1778
01:19:48,940 --> 01:19:52,700
One the Ebi Sixteen Man Tournament.
So I stand for Ebi.

1779
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:53,600
Yeah.
Bravo,

1780
01:19:53,601 --> 01:19:54,610
Bravo,
invitational.

1781
01:19:54,650 --> 01:19:55,370
Invitational.
Okay.

1782
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:58,490
Um,
and so don her asked them and I said,

1783
01:19:58,940 --> 01:20:00,530
well,
I could show him some shit.

1784
01:20:00,590 --> 01:20:05,590
Like I know it's going to sound 
ridiculous being a comedian and you 

1785
01:20:05,590 --> 01:20:05,750
know,
just a commentator.

1786
01:20:07,420 --> 01:20:09,150
The skies man.
Well,

1787
01:20:09,151 --> 01:20:09,880
it's,
it's,

1788
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:14,960
it sounds even to me.
Ridiculous to me to say to John Danaher 

1789
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:17,160
was one of the best Jujitsu teachers in 
the world,

1790
01:20:17,450 --> 01:20:18,180
you know,
hey,

1791
01:20:18,750 --> 01:20:21,590
there's a guy that I know,
his name's me,

1792
01:20:23,430 --> 01:20:24,220
you know,
it's just,

1793
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:26,010
they're so short,
Joe.

1794
01:20:26,011 --> 01:20:31,011
I'm not,
I'm not so much dear house and trained 

1795
01:20:31,011 --> 01:20:31,011
here a few times.

1796
01:20:31,011 --> 01:20:32,760
You're a beast.
Had had had been another time,

1797
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,670
I think you probably would have been a 
hell of an MMA fighter yourself.

1798
01:20:35,910 --> 01:20:38,700
Maybe people ask me that all the time 
and I say,

1799
01:20:39,270 --> 01:20:41,310
Joe Probably.
I mean you.

1800
01:20:41,311 --> 01:20:43,260
You're a superior athlete.
There's no doubt about it.

1801
01:20:43,320 --> 01:20:46,140
You've got the fast twitch muscle fiber.
You've got the power.

1802
01:20:46,260 --> 01:20:49,380
I think a ha.
Had you had a chance,

1803
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:54,300
let's say maybe 10 years prior to when 
it started,

1804
01:20:54,450 --> 01:20:55,410
you know?
Well,

1805
01:20:55,411 --> 01:20:57,120
that's very nice of you.
I don't know.

1806
01:20:57,230 --> 01:20:58,920
I mean,
I'm not being nice.

1807
01:20:58,921 --> 01:21:00,650
I'm being honest.
You know,

1808
01:21:00,660 --> 01:21:02,100
you're really athletic,
strong guy.

1809
01:21:02,930 --> 01:21:07,930
Well,
I certainly would have competed in mma 

1810
01:21:07,930 --> 01:21:10,080
like I did and kickboxing and taekwondo,
but I totally.

1811
01:21:10,081 --> 01:21:15,081
Honestly though,
I've always been terrified of brain 

1812
01:21:15,081 --> 01:21:17,481
damage.
I knew too many people when I was young 

1813
01:21:17,481 --> 01:21:19,080
that I knew were punchy it.
It scares the shit out of me.

1814
01:21:19,140 --> 01:21:20,820
It's still to this day scares the shit 
out of me.

1815
01:21:21,060 --> 01:21:23,100
That's one of the reasons why I tell 
anybody.

1816
01:21:23,101 --> 01:21:28,101
If they're even thinking,
even they even have one foot out the 

1817
01:21:28,101 --> 01:21:28,470
back door through thinking about getting
out,

1818
01:21:28,510 --> 01:21:33,510
get out,
just get out because it's going to be 

1819
01:21:33,510 --> 01:21:33,510
some animal in there that's not thinking
about getting out.

1820
01:21:33,510 --> 01:21:34,560
There's going to be some,
some crates,

1821
01:21:34,590 --> 01:21:39,590
young psychopath who's only thinking 
about putting his shit to your face and 

1822
01:21:39,590 --> 01:21:41,410
he's probably going to do it a pro.
Well,

1823
01:21:41,470 --> 01:21:43,400
sooner or later is going to happen.
You know,

1824
01:21:43,410 --> 01:21:46,670
I lived in Philadelphia for many,
many years and uh,

1825
01:21:46,710 --> 01:21:48,960
smoking Joe Fraser used to be down in my
neighborhood.

1826
01:21:48,961 --> 01:21:52,230
Sometimes the poor guy could barely put 
two words together.

1827
01:21:52,890 --> 01:21:55,320
Hello to him.
And he didn't even know what he said.

1828
01:21:55,410 --> 01:21:59,220
It was just really sad he was gone when 
that happened to a lot of those guys.

1829
01:21:59,370 --> 01:22:01,920
I've seen it.
I've seen it in my time in the UFC.

1830
01:22:02,250 --> 01:22:02,760
And,
uh,

1831
01:22:02,761 --> 01:22:05,310
I,
I saw it in my kickboxing days.

1832
01:22:05,311 --> 01:22:07,320
I saw it with guys when,
you know,

1833
01:22:07,490 --> 01:22:09,360
when I went from taekwondo to 
kickboxing,

1834
01:22:09,750 --> 01:22:12,240
I spent a lot of time in boxing gyms 
and,

1835
01:22:12,241 --> 01:22:15,630
um,
I got to watch a lot of guys get beat up

1836
01:22:15,631 --> 01:22:19,200
and training.
And over the course of just a few years,

1837
01:22:19,201 --> 01:22:21,450
like three or four years,
I could see deterioration.

1838
01:22:21,810 --> 01:22:26,810
And that's why Jujitsu and submission 
wrestling is so much fun because you can

1839
01:22:27,791 --> 01:22:30,810
pretty much go full tilt,
really spend yourself,

1840
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:36,080
get a nice workout.
No one necessarily needs to get hurt if 

1841
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:38,070
it hurts,
even if it's highly uncomfortable.

1842
01:22:38,230 --> 01:22:39,290
He just,
you know.

1843
01:22:39,930 --> 01:22:40,710
Yeah,
that's it.

1844
01:22:40,790 --> 01:22:41,490
Yep.
You know,

1845
01:22:41,530 --> 01:22:43,040
I mean,
provided you godly,

1846
01:22:43,041 --> 01:22:48,041
let's go.
You always have to have trust with your 

1847
01:22:48,041 --> 01:22:50,091
partners,
but that is one thing you can do well 

1848
01:22:50,091 --> 01:22:53,661
into advanced stage and it is a great 
anti aging tool if you go at it in the 

1849
01:22:54,331 --> 01:22:55,740
right way.
Yeah.

1850
01:22:55,741 --> 01:23:00,741
And I think one of the things that you 
brought up earlier when it comes to 

1851
01:23:00,741 --> 01:23:03,470
joint manipulation or joint mobility and
just flexibility and mobility,

1852
01:23:04,350 --> 01:23:06,370
it's.
I think it's very important

1853
01:23:06,370 --> 01:23:09,040
that people realize that if you want 
your body to be healthy,

1854
01:23:09,190 --> 01:23:14,190
you have to use it all the time.
You can't have any excuses like old men 

1855
01:23:14,321 --> 01:23:16,480
have to actually have to work out more 
than young guys.

1856
01:23:16,870 --> 01:23:20,380
I got to work out every day,
even a couple of hours every day just to

1857
01:23:20,381 --> 01:23:22,010
maintain seven days a week.
Yeah.

1858
01:23:22,690 --> 01:23:26,260
It's not hard.
I'm not doing high intensity every day,

1859
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:27,940
you know,
high intensity twice a week.

1860
01:23:28,060 --> 01:23:29,800
So I don't burn out.
Uh,

1861
01:23:29,801 --> 01:23:34,801
even younger guys,
especially if you're involved with any 

1862
01:23:34,801 --> 01:23:36,901
kind of sport,
you got to be really careful that you 

1863
01:23:36,901 --> 01:23:39,451
don't.
Overtrain overtraining is a epidemic 

1864
01:23:39,451 --> 01:23:39,451
amongst grapplers,
Jujitsu guys.

1865
01:23:39,451 --> 01:23:44,431
Uh,
even mma guys are just chronically burn 

1866
01:23:44,431 --> 01:23:44,431
it and burn it out,
but you know,

1867
01:23:44,431 --> 01:23:48,720
too hard workouts a week is enough and 
everyday you guys do plenty of mobility 

1868
01:23:49,450 --> 01:23:52,630
and I'd like to do plenty of breathing 
exercises,

1869
01:23:52,631 --> 01:23:55,570
walking cardio and I do some static 
stretching,

1870
01:23:56,140 --> 01:23:58,230
but it's enabled me to still,
you know,

1871
01:23:58,290 --> 01:23:59,510
I can still hold my own in the mat.

1872
01:23:59,510 --> 01:24:02,790
And I surprised guy sometimes when we 
get on the mat and roll around,

1873
01:24:03,330 --> 01:24:05,590
you know,
at first they start baby in May and then

1874
01:24:05,591 --> 01:24:06,540
they say,
oh,

1875
01:24:06,610 --> 01:24:11,610
stevie still gotta go in there.
And then they start upping the ante a 

1876
01:24:11,610 --> 01:24:11,610
little bit.
Of course,

1877
01:24:11,610 --> 01:24:12,940
you know,
at the end,

1878
01:24:12,941 --> 01:24:15,040
um,
I'm usually the one tap in,

1879
01:24:15,041 --> 01:24:20,041
but how is your shoulder,
I know you were having some shoulder 

1880
01:24:20,041 --> 01:24:20,130
issues for.
I still got some issues with it ever get

1881
01:24:20,140 --> 01:24:21,760
it looked at by a doctor.
I did.

1882
01:24:21,910 --> 01:24:25,300
Here's the big old bone spur and there 
just from doing silly stupid shit,

1883
01:24:25,330 --> 01:24:27,550
not tapping quick enough,
had a couple of injuries to it,

1884
01:24:27,551 --> 01:24:29,500
you know,
it started back in college actually.

1885
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:32,140
So I don't do any overhead pressing or 
anything anymore.

1886
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:34,210
I can still do Hindu pushups and things 
like that.

1887
01:24:34,690 --> 01:24:38,110
I could still do depths.
Will you still do those shield cast with

1888
01:24:38,111 --> 01:24:39,060
uh,
with kettle,

1889
01:24:39,190 --> 01:24:40,060
with a club's?

1890
01:24:40,090 --> 01:24:45,090
Not so much because I,
I can't travel with that stuff so I 

1891
01:24:45,090 --> 01:24:46,960
pretty much went to bodyweight and 
isometrics and so forth,

1892
01:24:46,961 --> 01:24:48,790
you know,
a lot of mobility stuff.

1893
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:50,140
But uh,
I would,

1894
01:24:50,260 --> 01:24:50,940
uh,
here,

1895
01:24:50,950 --> 01:24:52,930
here's a good resource for your 
listeners.

1896
01:24:53,150 --> 01:24:55,930
Any of you guys out there listening that
have shoulder issues,

1897
01:24:56,140 --> 01:25:01,140
go and buy the book shoulder pain.
It's solution and it's prevention by Dr 

1898
01:25:02,170 --> 01:25:07,170
John M Kirsch.
He was a former orthopedic surgeon who 

1899
01:25:07,170 --> 01:25:09,781
used to do surgery for a living.
That's how you know a doctor can either 

1900
01:25:09,781 --> 01:25:12,790
cut you or give you medication to mask 
the symptoms,

1901
01:25:13,330 --> 01:25:15,220
but it can't do anything to really help 
you.

1902
01:25:15,580 --> 01:25:20,580
Well,
cursed found that bar hanging with a 

1903
01:25:20,580 --> 01:25:23,071
brachial hang [inaudible] cure.
Almost every type of shoulder ailment 

1904
01:25:23,071 --> 01:25:24,430
would get people out of pain.
Will explain.

1905
01:25:24,431 --> 01:25:29,431
A brachial hand gives you,
just made a lot with the palms facing 

1906
01:25:29,431 --> 01:25:29,431
away.
Shoulder width.

1907
01:25:29,431 --> 01:25:31,240
You know,
I usually don't use my thumb or finger,

1908
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:33,070
uh,
I mean my,

1909
01:25:33,071 --> 01:25:35,500
uh,
my thumb just grab it.

1910
01:25:35,501 --> 01:25:38,380
Like you would grab a baseball guy just 
like amongst call,

1911
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:40,490
which is what you would do for a 
grappler anyway.

1912
01:25:40,510 --> 01:25:45,510
You never really have like you Americano
holder and you just hang and it 

1913
01:25:45,941 --> 01:25:49,840
stretches out the coracoid bone.
And then the Uranus has loan as a.

1914
01:25:49,860 --> 01:25:51,760
it's like a little bone in the shoulder 
that,

1915
01:25:51,850 --> 01:25:54,340
that.
What happens is as you get older,

1916
01:25:54,490 --> 01:25:56,170
it starts to impinge back,
bring it up,

1917
01:25:56,740 --> 01:25:59,730
that book,
a shoulder pain and solutioning and make

1918
01:25:59,740 --> 01:26:01,000
a t shirt that says,
bring that up,

1919
01:26:01,001 --> 01:26:02,220
Jamie.
There we go.

1920
01:26:04,050 --> 01:26:08,690
His shoulder pain,
shoulder impingement,

1921
01:26:09,020 --> 01:26:11,590
rotator cuff tears,
um,

1922
01:26:12,740 --> 01:26:13,740
labral tears,
you know,

1923
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:17,300
four and a half stars on Amazon,
135 customer reviews.

1924
01:26:17,570 --> 01:26:19,770
That is a strong endorsement rotarian.
I'm telling you,

1925
01:26:19,790 --> 01:26:21,470
man,
when of course,

1926
01:26:21,530 --> 01:26:26,530
part of my problem is it's hard to find 
a horizontal bar sometimes when you're 

1927
01:26:26,530 --> 01:26:26,530
traveling,
you know,

1928
01:26:26,530 --> 01:26:28,140
they take all the pull up bars out of 
that.

1929
01:26:28,290 --> 01:26:30,290
The plane routes.
Why?

1930
01:26:30,410 --> 01:26:32,160
I don't know,
maybe you know,

1931
01:26:32,300 --> 01:26:34,310
poor johnny's to obese to pull himself 
up.

1932
01:26:34,311 --> 01:26:34,920
We,
you know,

1933
01:26:34,970 --> 01:26:36,980
God forbid you feel bad about himself,
you know,

1934
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:40,070
does it have to be this way?
You've got to be a break your hand,

1935
01:26:40,100 --> 01:26:45,100
so it has to be palms facing forward.
Let the shoulder come out of the socket 

1936
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:48,440
and you just hand passively until your 
grip starts to get tired.

1937
01:26:48,441 --> 01:26:53,441
You can do it multiple times.
You will be absolutely amazed how good 

1938
01:26:53,441 --> 01:26:57,791
your shoulders will feel from doe.
That so full arm strength or full arm 

1939
01:26:57,791 --> 01:26:58,200
locked down just completely.
Yeah,

1940
01:26:58,230 --> 01:27:01,460
and you just completely,
completely relaxed.

1941
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:02,780
Okay,
so you just hang,

1942
01:27:02,810 --> 01:27:07,190
just hang and just let the shoulder,
let the humans come out of the socket.

1943
01:27:07,250 --> 01:27:08,450
And Hack.
So is it,

1944
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:09,940
what is it doing?
It's just like relax.

1945
01:27:09,950 --> 01:27:12,050
He just opens up the joint.

1946
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:15,590
He gives the universe more ability to 
move.

1947
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:17,840
Even with the bone spur I have in the 
shoulder,

1948
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:20,570
when I hang regulate,
I have zero pain.

1949
01:27:20,780 --> 01:27:22,280
Whoa,
that's crazy.

1950
01:27:22,281 --> 01:27:27,281
And this guy stopped doing surgery.
This is the guy who made his living 

1951
01:27:27,281 --> 01:27:28,070
doing surgery.
Now he doesn't advocate Shaw.

1952
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:30,140
He says this works better.
Why?

1953
01:27:30,141 --> 01:27:32,840
This is an orthopedic board,
Certified Orthopedic Guy,

1954
01:27:33,140 --> 01:27:38,140
and he shows the,
a study where he did a study with the 

1955
01:27:38,140 --> 01:27:39,410
old folks.
I'm telling you,

1956
01:27:39,411 --> 01:27:41,780
it feels really,
really nice.

1957
01:27:42,290 --> 01:27:42,950
Really,
really,

1958
01:27:42,951 --> 01:27:44,500
really good.
So we'll pull lists.

1959
01:27:44,720 --> 01:27:47,840
I use this for all my clients.
I do a lot of online personal training,

1960
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,590
fat loss diet programs and such.
And uh,

1961
01:27:50,660 --> 01:27:54,290
all my guys that have shoulder issues,
I get them hanging.

1962
01:27:54,830 --> 01:27:57,890
And Yeah,
there is interesting.

1963
01:27:58,430 --> 01:27:59,330
I'll tell you,
Joe,

1964
01:27:59,390 --> 01:28:01,340
if you having any shoulder stuff going 
on right now,

1965
01:28:01,341 --> 01:28:03,410
just start hanging everyday,
even multiple times.

1966
01:28:03,860 --> 01:28:07,280
Shoulders and full of good.
That sounds counterintuitive.

1967
01:28:07,281 --> 01:28:12,281
Like it's too simple to be true,
but it's one of those things that is 

1968
01:28:12,281 --> 01:28:12,281
true.
Well,

1969
01:28:12,281 --> 01:28:14,460
I had some tears in my shoulder and uh,
I got a,

1970
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:17,120
it was having some pain so I finally 
went and got an Mri,

1971
01:28:17,450 --> 01:28:22,450
apparently had been dislocated and I 
never even knew it had been dislocated 

1972
01:28:22,450 --> 01:28:26,590
from Jujitsu.
I don't even want to see the damn 

1973
01:28:26,590 --> 01:28:26,590
pictures,
you know.

1974
01:28:26,590 --> 01:28:26,590
And uh,
had a,

1975
01:28:26,590 --> 01:28:26,590
uh,
had a labral tear.

1976
01:28:26,590 --> 01:28:31,570
I had a torn bicep tendon and I had a 
um,

1977
01:28:32,660 --> 01:28:37,660
what is it?
I'm liberal and a rotator cuff rotator 

1978
01:28:37,660 --> 01:28:39,170
cuff tear two,
you have any experts in there and he got

1979
01:28:39,340 --> 01:28:44,340
a bunch of shit going on there as well.
And anybody that's played hard boy 

1980
01:28:44,340 --> 01:28:45,860
sports like we have all our lives,
you're going to get that shit.

1981
01:28:46,310 --> 01:28:51,310
But I'm telling you a what curse found 
it didn't matter what the source of the 

1982
01:28:51,310 --> 01:28:51,310
injury was.

1983
01:28:51,650 --> 01:28:55,100
The relief is profound when you do that 
daily hanging it,

1984
01:28:55,130 --> 01:28:58,160
it's just that amazing.
Hawaii I'd done.

1985
01:28:58,220 --> 01:29:01,040
What I have done is um,
get stem cell.

1986
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:06,800
I got stem cell shots in the shoulder 
and it is incredible what the healing 

1987
01:29:06,950 --> 01:29:11,950
for.
So I had always clicking and weird shit 

1988
01:29:11,950 --> 01:29:11,950
that was going on there.
All that shit went away.

1989
01:29:12,150 --> 01:29:13,440
Throw the hangs in there.
I'm in,

1990
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:14,550
I'm in.
I'm hanging.

1991
01:29:14,930 --> 01:29:19,930
Wish I could hang right now.
I'd like to do it right now while we're 

1992
01:29:19,930 --> 01:29:19,930
doing the podcast.
The lender.

1993
01:29:19,930 --> 01:29:23,770
Hey,
I need to find some kind of portable 

1994
01:29:23,770 --> 01:29:26,091
device that uh,
what about one of the ones that goes in 

1995
01:29:26,091 --> 01:29:26,091
front of a door?
Like those,

1996
01:29:26,091 --> 01:29:27,690
those ones that you do in a doorstop be 
great,

1997
01:29:27,691 --> 01:29:32,691
but you know,
I'd have to buy one in each city and 

1998
01:29:32,691 --> 01:29:32,691
then it just dump.
It gets annoying.

1999
01:29:32,691 --> 01:29:33,330
You're committed to this.

2000
01:29:33,330 --> 01:29:34,950
Are you were,
you were saying before that you might be

2001
01:29:34,951 --> 01:29:39,951
thinking about Maui as a base?
I am slowing down just a little bit.

2002
01:29:39,991 --> 01:29:44,991
What?
I've been doing this since about 2005 I 

2003
01:29:44,991 --> 01:29:45,480
think.
Well,

2004
01:29:45,481 --> 01:29:47,130
when I met you,
you had a truck?

2005
01:29:47,160 --> 01:29:48,360
Yeah,
I was living in a van,

2006
01:29:48,361 --> 01:29:50,820
a camper and know like I can't be 
bothered with this fucking truck.

2007
01:29:50,850 --> 01:29:52,200
And I,
I really liked it.

2008
01:29:52,230 --> 01:29:54,590
But then I started traveling.
What's the hell do you do with you,

2009
01:29:54,780 --> 01:29:56,460
your rv?
You know,

2010
01:29:56,550 --> 01:29:59,090
you can't just park it somewhere,
store it.

2011
01:29:59,150 --> 01:30:03,420
You got to find somebody you like and 
you got to turn the engine over.

2012
01:30:03,970 --> 01:30:05,030
You got to maintain,
you know,

2013
01:30:05,050 --> 01:30:10,050
mice get inside.
A lot of these are vision to the 

2014
01:30:10,050 --> 01:30:11,280
electrical wiring up and yeah,
totally destroys your electrical system.

2015
01:30:11,680 --> 01:30:13,200
Yeah.
Abandoned vehicles.

2016
01:30:13,201 --> 01:30:13,820
Uh,
you know,

2017
01:30:13,821 --> 01:30:16,080
if you just sit it,
a little critters get in there.

2018
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:17,970
Yeah.
It's not uncommon at all.

2019
01:30:18,120 --> 01:30:21,090
So what the hell do you do with it?
So I finally just sold it,

2020
01:30:21,630 --> 01:30:26,630
talking of the power of the Internet.
I sold my camper van to a guy who had 

2021
01:30:26,630 --> 01:30:28,230
never seen.
I was in Germany.

2022
01:30:28,231 --> 01:30:32,760
He was in San Diego and the van was up 
in,

2023
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:34,710
uh,
in Seattle.

2024
01:30:35,100 --> 01:30:39,150
I sold it to him sight unseen to send 
him pictures as very honest.

2025
01:30:39,151 --> 01:30:44,151
I had a bunch of shit wrong with it.
I told him every single thing that was 

2026
01:30:44,151 --> 01:30:44,151
wrong with it,
you know,

2027
01:30:44,151 --> 01:30:46,410
we agreed on a price.
He wired me the money.

2028
01:30:46,620 --> 01:30:49,350
I mailed him the title and the key 
because I traveled with,

2029
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:54,400
you know,
I kept a key and I had the title with 

2030
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:54,400
me.
I mailed that to him.

2031
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:57,750
He went up and got it.
And drove it back down to San Diego from

2032
01:30:57,751 --> 01:30:58,890
Seattle.
Wow.

2033
01:30:59,040 --> 01:30:59,850
The power of the Internet.

2034
01:30:59,850 --> 01:31:00,900
My friend.
That's amazing.

2035
01:31:00,901 --> 01:31:04,140
Put it on craigslist and a boom.
I got a uh,

2036
01:31:04,160 --> 01:31:07,620
you know,
I had a few people bid on it and uh,

2037
01:31:07,940 --> 01:31:09,930
if you would've told me,
oh,

2038
01:31:09,931 --> 01:31:13,350
even 20 years ago that I'd be making a 
living on the internet,

2039
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:14,320
you know.
Well,

2040
01:31:14,330 --> 01:31:17,220
essentially you make a living doing not 
to seminars,

2041
01:31:17,221 --> 01:31:19,650
but you do have a lot of online stuff.
A lot of live stuff.

2042
01:31:19,651 --> 01:31:22,140
Yet what?
Say a understood the,

2043
01:31:22,250 --> 01:31:27,250
uh,
the power of the Internet for doing 

2044
01:31:27,250 --> 01:31:27,750
online personal training.
Uh,

2045
01:31:27,990 --> 01:31:28,900
wow.
Well,

2046
01:31:28,910 --> 01:31:32,370
a lot of people found out about you and 
me included because of the Internet.

2047
01:31:32,371 --> 01:31:37,371
I mean I found out about you from 
research and Kettlebell exercises and 

2048
01:31:37,371 --> 01:31:37,740
that's how I got some of your early 
stuff.

2049
01:31:37,980 --> 01:31:42,980
And also I knew about you because I knew
that you were one of the first American 

2050
01:31:42,980 --> 01:31:42,980
Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belts.

2051
01:31:42,980 --> 01:31:45,600
One of the first hell Helson Gracie is 
first to be sure.

2052
01:31:46,050 --> 01:31:48,150
But that a,
I think there was a bunch.

2053
01:31:48,390 --> 01:31:50,670
There was a couple of guys that 
Machado's given,

2054
01:31:51,060 --> 01:31:55,140
but I was like that first tier of actual
Gracie Jujitsu guys,

2055
01:31:55,460 --> 01:31:58,050
and then Horian and a Master Leo had 
the,

2056
01:31:58,051 --> 01:31:59,830
uh,
Gracie instructor training program.

2057
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:02,440
They were concerned that,
you know,

2058
01:32:02,441 --> 01:32:05,620
of the teaching quality.
There's a lot of guys out there teaching

2059
01:32:05,621 --> 01:32:06,880
that probably shouldn't have been 
teaching.

2060
01:32:07,270 --> 01:32:08,640
So they wanted,
they,

2061
01:32:08,641 --> 01:32:11,950
they had a specific educational style 
like how to teach the move.

2062
01:32:12,520 --> 01:32:15,670
And I was the first person to graduate 
from that instructor training program.

2063
01:32:15,850 --> 01:32:17,140
It was really good.
Will you,

2064
01:32:17,141 --> 01:32:20,830
I'm sure you're aware now the 
controversy of this Gracie University,

2065
01:32:20,831 --> 01:32:22,660
the thing that they're doing online,
they're doing.

2066
01:32:23,250 --> 01:32:26,770
The son's got a little carried away with
that blue about,

2067
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:27,500
uh,
I,

2068
01:32:27,700 --> 01:32:29,740
I'm not real thrilled with them.
Oh,

2069
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:32,510
there's one guy who's given a ride brown
belts online here.

2070
01:32:32,630 --> 01:32:34,310
Yeah.
Do you mean a Gracie?

2071
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:35,530
No.
Oh No.

2072
01:32:35,710 --> 01:32:38,410
I don't even want to say his name,
but he's pretty respected guy.

2073
01:32:39,190 --> 01:32:41,930
I read on the underground that he's 
given away up to brown belt online.

2074
01:32:41,950 --> 01:32:44,520
How could you possibly respect that?
I mean,

2075
01:32:44,521 --> 01:32:49,450
I guess the only way I would think 
physically tested and proved himself.

2076
01:32:49,460 --> 01:32:50,660
That's what I was gonna say.
I,

2077
01:32:50,710 --> 01:32:55,180
I have seen guys that have trained 
pretty much from the Internet.

2078
01:32:55,420 --> 01:33:00,420
I went to Tahiti,
I was hired by a group of grapplers to 

2079
01:33:00,420 --> 01:33:03,130
prepare them for the Society Society 
Island Championship.

2080
01:33:03,700 --> 01:33:08,700
It was very popular.
A grappling is a traditional sport in 

2081
01:33:08,700 --> 01:33:11,020
amongst the Polynesian peoples.
And I went to Tahiti.

2082
01:33:11,021 --> 01:33:16,021
I stayed there three months.
I trained these guys for the Society 

2083
01:33:16,021 --> 01:33:20,280
Island Championships and the guy that 
was running it was still a white belt 

2084
01:33:20,280 --> 01:33:21,160
and uh,
he was a prison guard there and Tahiti,

2085
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:24,250
big guy and a unbelievable grappler.

2086
01:33:24,670 --> 01:33:28,480
He outweighed me probably about 50 
pounds yet he was very soft,

2087
01:33:28,490 --> 01:33:29,740
relaxed,
technical.

2088
01:33:29,860 --> 01:33:33,850
He had never actually had a teacher.
He learned it all watching online on the

2089
01:33:33,851 --> 01:33:35,140
Internet,
speaking of the bow then.

2090
01:33:35,640 --> 01:33:40,640
And I loved the way he trained with me.
He was very respectful even though as 

2091
01:33:40,640 --> 01:33:43,880
you know,
like 30 years older than him and much 

2092
01:33:43,880 --> 01:33:43,880
smaller.
We x a good training.

2093
01:33:44,330 --> 01:33:46,900
I just gave the guy that blew about 
right in the spot.

2094
01:33:47,220 --> 01:33:47,920
Wow.
I mean,

2095
01:33:47,921 --> 01:33:52,921
there was no way that that guy was a 
white belt and I've done that at 

2096
01:33:52,921 --> 01:33:56,011
different places where people don't have
a good instructor where they are under 

2097
01:33:56,011 --> 01:33:57,400
promoted and I'll get on the mat with 
them,

2098
01:33:57,401 --> 01:34:00,010
I see what they can do and I say,
wow,

2099
01:34:00,040 --> 01:34:02,000
okay,
this guy is under promoted.

2100
01:34:02,001 --> 01:34:05,740
He just hasn't had a chance to have a 
legitimate guy give him a promotion.

2101
01:34:06,010 --> 01:34:11,010
I have got rolling with a group of 
students and he was the teacher 

2102
01:34:11,441 --> 01:34:12,750
basically because people.
Teacher.

2103
01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:14,920
Yeah,
out teacher and his guys were good.

2104
01:34:15,490 --> 01:34:16,630
They were really,
really good.

2105
01:34:16,870 --> 01:34:21,870
Well,
if you just really pay attention to the 

2106
01:34:21,870 --> 01:34:24,451
fundamentals and you really understand 
the principles behind each individual 

2107
01:34:24,451 --> 01:34:28,231
technique,
you can learn a lot online to learn a 

2108
01:34:28,231 --> 01:34:28,231
lot online,
but not brown belt.

2109
01:34:28,231 --> 01:34:33,000
Now I just feel like I need someone 
there right there with you below about 

2110
01:34:34,210 --> 01:34:35,540
almost anyone can get.
Yes,

2111
01:34:35,550 --> 01:34:36,460
I agree.
I mean,

2112
01:34:36,461 --> 01:34:38,860
I heard a really funny analogy one time 
from a,

2113
01:34:38,920 --> 01:34:42,130
I think one of carly gracie's barbells 
or maybe it was health got bit.

2114
01:34:42,370 --> 01:34:44,470
He said basically a white belt as a 
sperm.

2115
01:34:46,150 --> 01:34:51,150
The seed.
By the time your four degree a wipe out 

2116
01:34:51,150 --> 01:34:55,621
your like,
like a little baby that was just born 

2117
01:34:55,621 --> 01:34:55,621
and then the blue about is like a little
toddler,

2118
01:34:55,621 --> 01:34:58,490
like just a little little kid doesn't 
even know what he doesn't know yet,

2119
01:34:58,730 --> 01:35:01,310
but the time you're like a four degree 
blue about your,

2120
01:35:01,420 --> 01:35:02,540
you're like a child.

2121
01:35:02,990 --> 01:35:05,170
And then the purple bow is like a 
teenager,

2122
01:35:05,500 --> 01:35:08,640
dangerous teenager.
Well you know,

2123
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:13,960
you got the technique but you just 
starting to know that they can do it to 

2124
01:35:13,960 --> 01:35:18,430
purple belts.
I feel like it's like some of the most 

2125
01:35:18,430 --> 01:35:20,201
dangerous.
That's a dangerous guy because a lot of 

2126
01:35:20,201 --> 01:35:20,800
times he's still using a lot of power 
but he got the technique to.

2127
01:35:21,110 --> 01:35:22,830
And then of course by the time you're 
your brand brand,

2128
01:35:22,940 --> 01:35:27,000
you're like a young man and you know,
basically a brown belt is a black powder

2129
01:35:27,020 --> 01:35:29,720
and the skies,
it's just once you make Brown bought,

2130
01:35:29,740 --> 01:35:32,000
you've got to make black belt unless he 
does outright quit.

2131
01:35:32,150 --> 01:35:33,680
Yeah.
And you know,

2132
01:35:34,020 --> 01:35:35,770
and,
and then a black box like you know,

2133
01:35:35,960 --> 01:35:38,840
a grown man.
But for me,

2134
01:35:38,841 --> 01:35:41,210
I don't know about you,
but once I got the black bow,

2135
01:35:41,750 --> 01:35:46,550
I felt like a whole new layer of 
learning was taking place at that point.

2136
01:35:46,700 --> 01:35:48,950
Well,
you'd never stopped learning and Jujitsu

2137
01:35:48,951 --> 01:35:53,951
as long as your bodies to work.
So what we're talking about these new 

2138
01:35:53,951 --> 01:35:54,950
moves that are constantly coming out.
But then you know,

2139
01:35:54,980 --> 01:35:58,040
John John Machado has this really 
interesting take on things.

2140
01:35:58,041 --> 01:35:59,420
He said,
the more you know,

2141
01:35:59,421 --> 01:36:01,430
the less you use Lsu.
He goes,

2142
01:36:01,431 --> 01:36:06,431
I might know 10,000
techniques but to win match I might use 

2143
01:36:06,431 --> 01:36:06,800
to solve the said that one time he says,
look,

2144
01:36:06,801 --> 01:36:09,500
I know 30 ways to pass the guard,
but I only use two.

2145
01:36:09,890 --> 01:36:13,610
I have a backup,
move a and then backup plan.

2146
01:36:13,611 --> 01:36:17,210
Big Case it doesn't work.
And I think that's just the way it is.

2147
01:36:17,211 --> 01:36:21,590
Man was really good guy follow game that
that song's pressure.

2148
01:36:21,591 --> 01:36:23,480
Solid top gaze.
His bodyweight.

2149
01:36:23,510 --> 01:36:25,490
So well,
you know when I used to train to Sala he

2150
01:36:25,491 --> 01:36:29,000
could tap me out on the cross side 
without even putting a submission hold,

2151
01:36:29,270 --> 01:36:31,430
just crushing me with his weight.

2152
01:36:31,430 --> 01:36:32,510
And he's not,
I mean,

2153
01:36:32,630 --> 01:36:34,160
he's heavy,
but he's not that heavy.

2154
01:36:34,860 --> 01:36:38,480
He would rob your breath.
It was just the most horrible feeling.

2155
01:36:38,481 --> 01:36:40,700
It's like being waterboarded or 
something,

2156
01:36:40,701 --> 01:36:41,540
man.
It was like,

2157
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:44,870
oh my God,
the pressure he learned to do that,

2158
01:36:45,200 --> 01:36:47,360
you know?
But yeah,

2159
01:36:47,420 --> 01:36:48,250
uh,
the,

2160
01:36:48,530 --> 01:36:50,370
I think for,
um,

2161
01:36:50,660 --> 01:36:55,660
as far as moves and so forth,
probably one of the most outstanding 

2162
01:36:55,660 --> 01:37:00,070
clinics have ever witnessed was when 
John Shock Machado was in the second 

2163
01:37:00,140 --> 01:37:05,140
abut Dhabi.
I actually went over to the Arab 

2164
01:37:05,140 --> 01:37:05,810
Emirates and I wanted to support Salo 
and whoever at that time.

2165
01:37:06,260 --> 01:37:10,600
And I couldn't believe the clinic he put
on all closed guard too.

2166
01:37:10,640 --> 01:37:13,070
That's another lost art.
You don't see too many guys use it,

2167
01:37:13,220 --> 01:37:14,150
you know,
cron uses.

2168
01:37:14,160 --> 01:37:18,140
It could close guard.
But John Jock put on a clinic.

2169
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:23,600
Unbelievable man.
He had this super fight with Mario 

2170
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:23,760
Sperry.
I never saw such a.

2171
01:37:23,770 --> 01:37:25,100
He almost put sperry out,
man.

2172
01:37:25,420 --> 01:37:26,900
Yeah.
John John is no joke,

2173
01:37:26,901 --> 01:37:28,400
man.
He's always been a beast.

2174
01:37:28,430 --> 01:37:31,370
He's a really brilliant person to like,
uh,

2175
01:37:31,460 --> 01:37:33,440
like as a human being.
He's a great guy.

2176
01:37:33,800 --> 01:37:36,540
On top of being this amazing Jujitsu 
practitioner.

2177
01:37:36,541 --> 01:37:39,950
It's just a beautiful human being,
and from that closed guard,

2178
01:37:39,951 --> 01:37:43,070
he only used for basic moves,
triangle arm block,

2179
01:37:43,190 --> 01:37:47,480
Omoplata a gay attain.
And of course some sweeps to back it up.

2180
01:37:47,630 --> 01:37:48,840
That was it,
you know,

2181
01:37:48,950 --> 01:37:50,360
and he,
the way he put them together,

2182
01:37:50,361 --> 01:37:51,920
it was like a machine got attacked by 
Bup,

2183
01:37:51,921 --> 01:37:52,310
bup,
bup,

2184
01:37:52,311 --> 01:37:52,700
bup,
bup,

2185
01:37:52,701 --> 01:37:56,160
bup is like,
the guy in the guard was so hard

2186
01:37:56,370 --> 01:37:59,460
just not to get caught,
never saw anything about it.

2187
01:37:59,550 --> 01:38:00,420
It was like,
wow.

2188
01:38:00,540 --> 01:38:03,570
It just goes to show you that the basics
done well.

2189
01:38:04,380 --> 01:38:05,820
That's all you really need.
Yeah.

2190
01:38:05,850 --> 01:38:06,720
Well,
you know,

2191
01:38:06,780 --> 01:38:11,780
Hickson and crone,
crone to this day still just uses the 

2192
01:38:11,780 --> 01:38:11,780
basics.
Unbelievable.

2193
01:38:11,780 --> 01:38:12,130
I mean,
you know,

2194
01:38:12,131 --> 01:38:13,800
and that's,
it sounds derogatory.

2195
01:38:13,801 --> 01:38:15,600
Almost like someone like Minotauro 
wants,

2196
01:38:15,601 --> 01:38:19,410
got upset that Vinny Magalhaes many lace
was talking about his,

2197
01:38:19,411 --> 01:38:22,170
um,
his Jujitsu and he said it's very basic,

2198
01:38:22,740 --> 01:38:25,290
but that's not bad.
NASIC is not bad at all.

2199
01:38:25,291 --> 01:38:26,460
So,
and said that about me,

2200
01:38:26,461 --> 01:38:27,750
I take it as a cop.
Well,

2201
01:38:28,020 --> 01:38:29,220
personally,
you know,

2202
01:38:29,250 --> 01:38:32,910
basic is just honed to a razor sharp 
edge.

2203
01:38:32,911 --> 01:38:34,620
All of the basic techniques that you 
know,

2204
01:38:34,621 --> 01:38:36,920
I think there's um,
like harder gracie's another example,

2205
01:38:36,950 --> 01:38:41,950
another example,
one of the best Jujitsu artist in the 

2206
01:38:41,950 --> 01:38:41,950
world,
but very basic.

2207
01:38:41,950 --> 01:38:41,950
What year was that,
where he,

2208
01:38:41,950 --> 01:38:41,950
he.

2209
01:38:41,950 --> 01:38:46,730
One is the vision and then he tapped 
everybody in the open division with an 

2210
01:38:46,730 --> 01:38:51,380
ex chuck from the mountain.
He used that one take down that one 

2211
01:38:51,380 --> 01:38:55,560
throw heat does he mad at every single.
And these were all professional level,

2212
01:38:55,561 --> 01:39:00,561
best black belts in the world.
He tapped every single guy with the 

2213
01:39:00,561 --> 01:39:01,230
basic extra for the mass.
Crazy.

2214
01:39:01,260 --> 01:39:03,420
Just the first thing you learned,
right as a,

2215
01:39:03,421 --> 01:39:04,200
as a,
uh,

2216
01:39:04,870 --> 01:39:06,860
your first,
first couple months and just Jesse,

2217
01:39:06,861 --> 01:39:11,861
you learn basic extra.
The guy tapped the best in the world 

2218
01:39:11,861 --> 01:39:15,590
just doing basic stuff with.
It's such an advantage in Jujitsu to 

2219
01:39:15,590 --> 01:39:16,010
being tall and long.
Oh,

2220
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:21,200
what a nightmare.
It's a giant advantage because of the 

2221
01:39:21,200 --> 01:39:21,750
tall and long guys have so much leverage
so much.

2222
01:39:21,930 --> 01:39:26,220
And also the ability to get techniques 
and lock them up or a short,

2223
01:39:26,221 --> 01:39:28,580
stubby armed person like me just 
doesn't.

2224
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:33,800
My arms don't connect in spots like with
Doris chokes and things along those 

2225
01:39:33,800 --> 01:39:35,880
lines where you just,
you can have more space.

2226
01:39:35,881 --> 01:39:38,560
They have their arm goes deeper.
They can bet.

2227
01:39:38,561 --> 01:39:43,561
You'll see people with every type of 
physique type lounge just there because 

2228
01:39:43,561 --> 01:39:47,001
yeah,
I'm speaking like fireplug kind of 

2229
01:39:47,001 --> 01:39:47,001
built.
I mean,

2230
01:39:47,001 --> 01:39:47,001
no one was shorter and stubbier than 
sallow.

2231
01:39:47,001 --> 01:39:49,410
Right.
Yet he's like one of the most winningest

2232
01:39:49,440 --> 01:39:51,450
Jujitsu guys ever in the world.
True.

2233
01:39:51,510 --> 01:39:52,470
Wow.
You know,

2234
01:39:52,471 --> 01:39:54,730
he just maximized.
He,

2235
01:39:54,900 --> 01:39:58,200
he adapted the Jujitsu was to his 
physique or horse Mr Paul Harris.

2236
01:39:58,350 --> 01:39:59,430
No,
perfect example.

2237
01:39:59,490 --> 01:40:00,870
Exactly.
So tank,

2238
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:02,850
that's the cool thing about the game.
You know,

2239
01:40:02,851 --> 01:40:04,320
it doesn't matter how you're built.
Big,

2240
01:40:04,350 --> 01:40:05,130
tall,
short,

2241
01:40:05,250 --> 01:40:06,250
you know,
uh,

2242
01:40:06,420 --> 01:40:08,670
whether you carry a little extra weight 
or you're really skinny,

2243
01:40:08,940 --> 01:40:11,760
you can adapt this to your,
your own body.

2244
01:40:12,030 --> 01:40:13,830
So we were talking about you moving to 
Maui.

2245
01:40:14,100 --> 01:40:15,120
Yeah.
After we got up,

2246
01:40:15,121 --> 01:40:16,620
we got off track a little bit,
but yeah.

2247
01:40:17,130 --> 01:40:18,690
Why,
why Maui and what?

2248
01:40:18,710 --> 01:40:20,010
What makes you a.
well,

2249
01:40:20,011 --> 01:40:22,530
you're going to laugh at this because 
it's not scientific,

2250
01:40:22,550 --> 01:40:24,530
but,
but it is a.

2251
01:40:24,580 --> 01:40:26,790
I use an astrologer.
This guy is amazing.

2252
01:40:26,791 --> 01:40:28,680
He used to be a stanford professor.
Can say his name.

2253
01:40:28,860 --> 01:40:29,430
Sure.
Okay.

2254
01:40:29,431 --> 01:40:31,170
His name is Robert Koch.
Uh,

2255
01:40:31,171 --> 01:40:32,250
his,
his website,

2256
01:40:32,251 --> 01:40:37,251
his star center.com.
I've been using this guy for a few 

2257
01:40:37,251 --> 01:40:37,251
years.
When I first heard about it,

2258
01:40:37,251 --> 01:40:40,290
I thought this is such bullshit.
I'm never going to do this,

2259
01:40:40,740 --> 01:40:45,740
you know,
the person that turned me onto it was 

2260
01:40:45,740 --> 01:40:45,740
my,
my girlfriend,

2261
01:40:45,740 --> 01:40:46,430
and she says,
listen man,

2262
01:40:46,460 --> 01:40:48,420
just do it reading with this guy.
Just do a reading.

2263
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:54,280
And I'm Sandra,
are you mean you take advice from a guy 

2264
01:40:54,280 --> 01:40:54,280
you've never met and you're going to 
listen to those guys.

2265
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:57,430
So I gave him my birthday date,
the time of birth,

2266
01:40:57,640 --> 01:40:59,290
whereas born,
that's it.

2267
01:40:59,410 --> 01:41:01,970
Plus my name.
He read my life to me as,

2268
01:41:02,290 --> 01:41:03,940
how are you doing this?
Well,

2269
01:41:03,970 --> 01:41:06,040
maybe you got on Wikipedia,
maybe,

2270
01:41:07,750 --> 01:41:10,990
but this was an impromptu call.
So I don't know.

2271
01:41:11,260 --> 01:41:12,630
All I know is that,
uh,

2272
01:41:12,631 --> 01:41:15,040
it's based in mathematics.
He believed,

2273
01:41:15,070 --> 01:41:15,600
you know,
like,

2274
01:41:15,601 --> 01:41:16,870
uh,
the Pythagoreans,

2275
01:41:16,871 --> 01:41:21,871
you know,
they believe that everything can be 

2276
01:41:21,871 --> 01:41:21,871
explained in numbers and in mathematics.
He was a former,

2277
01:41:21,871 --> 01:41:25,090
a stanford professor.
He came from academia and he gave it all

2278
01:41:25,091 --> 01:41:30,091
up to basic to this basic astrological,
but even more important.

2279
01:41:30,340 --> 01:41:35,340
He's like an old philosopher.
He's read all the ancient Greek 

2280
01:41:35,340 --> 01:41:35,920
philosophers and he's also a.
have you heard of this?

2281
01:41:36,070 --> 01:41:38,600
Mental Science,
mental science,

2282
01:41:38,620 --> 01:41:40,600
mental science.
Basically your,

2283
01:41:40,630 --> 01:41:45,630
your,
your reality is based on your thoughts 

2284
01:41:45,630 --> 01:41:45,730
and your,
your current reality is based on the sum

2285
01:41:45,731 --> 01:41:47,320
total of all your positive and negative 
thoughts.

2286
01:41:47,580 --> 01:41:52,580
Thought thoughts are a vibrational 
pattern and the vibe you put out is the 

2287
01:41:52,580 --> 01:41:53,860
vibe you attract.
So if you're like a real negative person

2288
01:41:54,070 --> 01:41:54,790
always,
you know,

2289
01:41:54,820 --> 01:41:59,820
think saying negative statements and 
fill in a lot of negative emotional 

2290
01:41:59,820 --> 01:42:03,600
things,
you're probably going to have a pretty 

2291
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:03,600
shitty life.

2292
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:03,600
And if you're thinking like a higher 
thought,

2293
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:04,960
ha her,
of course,

2294
01:42:04,961 --> 01:42:09,961
the highest would be love.
That would be the highest vibration 

2295
01:42:09,961 --> 01:42:09,961
you're going to have.
Good things happen to you.

2296
01:42:10,030 --> 01:42:10,940
That's the basic.
Yeah,

2297
01:42:10,970 --> 01:42:13,210
in a nutshell,
as much more complicated than that.

2298
01:42:13,450 --> 01:42:16,630
So like the secret essentially like this
grit,

2299
01:42:16,720 --> 01:42:18,200
right?
Which is a great little book.

2300
01:42:18,201 --> 01:42:20,950
Well anyway,
Robert Developed his,

2301
01:42:21,130 --> 01:42:23,140
uh,
his astrological,

2302
01:42:23,570 --> 01:42:25,020
uh,
uh,

2303
01:42:25,060 --> 01:42:25,810
based on,
on,

2304
01:42:25,870 --> 01:42:29,110
on mental science as well as a basic 
physics.

2305
01:42:29,111 --> 01:42:31,090
And so anyway,
he read my life,

2306
01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:33,850
he looked at all the places in the world
because,

2307
01:42:33,880 --> 01:42:36,880
you know,
you put off a vibration like,

2308
01:42:37,330 --> 01:42:40,810
like an energy vibration,
it can actually be measured,

2309
01:42:41,590 --> 01:42:42,360
right?
Your,

2310
01:42:42,361 --> 01:42:44,940
yours would be as identifiable as your 
fingerprints or you know,

2311
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:47,470
like an eye reading iridology or 
whatever.

2312
01:42:47,980 --> 01:42:50,710
And uh,
there's places on the earth that put off

2313
01:42:50,711 --> 01:42:54,070
a vibration also.
And the place that vibes best with me is

2314
01:42:54,071 --> 01:42:56,500
anywhere in the South Pacific,
but in particular,

2315
01:42:57,130 --> 01:42:58,930
Maui.
And he really,

2316
01:42:58,990 --> 01:43:03,990
he really honed it down to the town of 
[inaudible] to try to sell you a house 

2317
01:43:03,990 --> 01:43:05,620
there now.
No,

2318
01:43:05,650 --> 01:43:08,550
the spot 67 clover lane.
Yeah,

2319
01:43:08,560 --> 01:43:10,460
there we go man.
Let's go online and look at that.

2320
01:43:10,480 --> 01:43:13,040
Oh,
the house is for sale ads.

2321
01:43:13,720 --> 01:43:14,770
Damn Robert,
you're amazing.

2322
01:43:14,980 --> 01:43:15,530
No,
but,

2323
01:43:15,531 --> 01:43:16,480
uh,
so anyway,

2324
01:43:16,530 --> 01:43:19,130
now he is supposedly the best vibration 
for,

2325
01:43:19,160 --> 01:43:20,200
for me,
for you,

2326
01:43:20,290 --> 01:43:20,650
for me.

2327
01:43:20,720 --> 01:43:23,620
So I explained to me how this guy goes 
about it.

2328
01:43:23,621 --> 01:43:26,280
So he finds out what your address or 
what your,

2329
01:43:26,281 --> 01:43:28,140
your date of birth is,
well,

2330
01:43:28,160 --> 01:43:29,870
part of the world you're born,
what time?

2331
01:43:30,700 --> 01:43:35,560
And then once he has some kind of 
computer program with all his charts and

2332
01:43:35,561 --> 01:43:39,520
numbers and he plugs all this stuff in.
And then I asked them like,

2333
01:43:39,550 --> 01:43:40,150
well,
what is it?

2334
01:43:40,151 --> 01:43:44,620
You're actually looking at the computer 
and it says it's just basically he says,

2335
01:43:44,621 --> 01:43:48,760
I can't make exact predictions.
Said if I could make exact predictions.

2336
01:43:48,761 --> 01:43:51,800
I played the stock market and you know,
but uh,

2337
01:43:51,801 --> 01:43:52,530
you know,
I,

2338
01:43:52,531 --> 01:43:55,520
I can come up with high probability for 
certain things happening.

2339
01:43:56,120 --> 01:44:00,950
And also he's looking at you ever hear 
the collective consciousness,

2340
01:44:01,370 --> 01:44:03,380
you know,
you have your higher consciousness,

2341
01:44:03,620 --> 01:44:07,160
you have your subconscious.
But then there's a collective mindset.

2342
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:10,610
It's like everyone's emotions and moods 
and thoughts,

2343
01:44:11,120 --> 01:44:11,690
right?
Right.

2344
01:44:11,691 --> 01:44:13,370
Now it's one of fear,
you know,

2345
01:44:13,371 --> 01:44:15,560
everyone's so afraid,
you know,

2346
01:44:15,561 --> 01:44:19,100
I'm traveling all over the world so you 
can literally feel the fear right now,

2347
01:44:19,101 --> 01:44:21,830
Europe is all up in arms because of the 
terrorist attacks and things.

2348
01:44:21,830 --> 01:44:24,380
And people are really scared with the 
Isis and all this.

2349
01:44:24,620 --> 01:44:29,620
There's like a real fear mentality.
The problem is if you give into that 

2350
01:44:29,620 --> 01:44:32,951
fear mentality,
you actually create the very thing 

2351
01:44:32,951 --> 01:44:32,951
you're afraid of because you're 
basically concentrated on them.

2352
01:44:33,230 --> 01:44:34,940
It's like a form of visualization,
right?

2353
01:44:35,240 --> 01:44:40,240
If you're always like.
It was like the shark thing we were 

2354
01:44:40,240 --> 01:44:42,791
talking about,
I probably would create a situation 

2355
01:44:42,791 --> 01:44:44,750
where I'd meet a shark if I went 
swimming in the ocean because you know,

2356
01:44:44,780 --> 01:44:46,520
I put too much energy into that.
Yeah,

2357
01:44:46,521 --> 01:44:48,200
me too.
Whenever I was the snorkel,

2358
01:44:48,201 --> 01:44:49,250
the goggles underneath,
I'm like,

2359
01:44:49,251 --> 01:44:50,060
where is he?
Yeah,

2360
01:44:50,120 --> 01:44:52,190
exactly.
The soccer for you and I,

2361
01:44:52,191 --> 01:44:57,191
we,
we would probably possibly actually 

2362
01:44:57,191 --> 01:44:57,730
attract a negative situation like that.
I just sad.

2363
01:44:58,310 --> 01:45:00,230
But anyway,
there is a collective mindset.

2364
01:45:00,260 --> 01:45:03,320
You can even feel like different 
countries have different moods.

2365
01:45:03,500 --> 01:45:08,500
When I get off the plane,
I can actually feel that I'm pretty 

2366
01:45:08,500 --> 01:45:08,500
sensitive to this.

2367
01:45:08,500 --> 01:45:08,720
Like in Russia,
it's real somber,

2368
01:45:08,950 --> 01:45:11,390
kind of almost depressed.
You know,

2369
01:45:11,930 --> 01:45:13,100
a place like Maui.
It's like,

2370
01:45:13,130 --> 01:45:18,130
oh my God,
I just feel so happy because I was so 

2371
01:45:18,130 --> 01:45:18,130
lucky there in paradise there in 
paradise,

2372
01:45:18,130 --> 01:45:19,550
you know,
the mood is much higher.

2373
01:45:19,551 --> 01:45:24,551
The aloha spirit as they say hello.
So he told me that was the single best 

2374
01:45:24,551 --> 01:45:26,570
place.
Other places were a place in Alaska,

2375
01:45:26,820 --> 01:45:31,070
was a place near a little town I can't 
even recall.

2376
01:45:31,550 --> 01:45:34,850
And then another place was little part 
of Alaskan coast on the coast.

2377
01:45:35,090 --> 01:45:36,350
The coast is not bad.
Yeah.

2378
01:45:36,410 --> 01:45:37,520
Like near Anchorage.
Yeah,

2379
01:45:37,521 --> 01:45:39,140
it was near Anchorage.
You use a little town.

2380
01:45:39,141 --> 01:45:44,141
Just be amazed at how moderate the 
climate is to everyone says it's quite 

2381
01:45:44,141 --> 01:45:44,870
nice there.
So you know.

2382
01:45:44,871 --> 01:45:47,060
But.
So Alaska,

2383
01:45:47,240 --> 01:45:48,740
Turkey,
Maui,

2384
01:45:48,770 --> 01:45:49,710
Alaska.
Uh,

2385
01:45:49,940 --> 01:45:54,080
I think it wasn't a hard choice.
Well,

2386
01:45:54,081 --> 01:45:58,040
it's a very relaxed environment in my 
only to like the places relaxed.

2387
01:45:58,040 --> 01:46:00,200
It's a relaxed place to live,
you know,

2388
01:46:00,201 --> 01:46:02,030
as far as like the people that live 
there,

2389
01:46:02,031 --> 01:46:04,850
they're really cool and chilled out and 
totally children.

2390
01:46:04,940 --> 01:46:06,890
My webmaster lives there.
Chris Crook,

2391
01:46:07,160 --> 01:46:09,050
awesome guy.
So I,

2392
01:46:09,051 --> 01:46:10,730
you know,
I always have business to do with him.

2393
01:46:10,970 --> 01:46:12,660
He's been doing a great job for me.
You know,

2394
01:46:12,850 --> 01:46:17,850
what does the guy told you you need to 
live near like oil minds and South 

2395
01:46:17,850 --> 01:46:22,030
Dakota be less reluctant or more?
That would be oil minds near South 

2396
01:46:24,560 --> 01:46:25,010
Dakota.
You know what I'm saying?

2397
01:46:25,040 --> 01:46:30,040
Like someone that sucks.
You can live right outside of like some 

2398
01:46:30,040 --> 01:46:30,890
fracking fucking compounds.
Yeah,

2399
01:46:30,891 --> 01:46:35,891
that's an interesting point.
I think someone with a really negative 

2400
01:46:35,891 --> 01:46:36,800
mindset might have attracted a place 
like that.

2401
01:46:36,890 --> 01:46:41,890
So then I tried to keep the vibe heavy 
and I mean a light and at a higher 

2402
01:46:42,500 --> 01:46:44,610
higher level.
And uh,

2403
01:46:44,690 --> 01:46:49,690
you know,
you can attract goodness and abundance 

2404
01:46:49,690 --> 01:46:50,070
in your life,
just like

2405
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:50,910
the sacred.
That's a,

2406
01:46:50,911 --> 01:46:52,620
that's a good book for people to start.
Well,

2407
01:46:52,621 --> 01:46:54,720
it's us.
Anderson was,

2408
01:46:54,780 --> 01:46:59,780
was quite an interesting guy.
You the power of positive thinking for 

2409
01:46:59,780 --> 01:47:03,081
sure is real.
I mean for sure there's a lot of good 

2410
01:47:03,081 --> 01:47:03,960
that can be done in your life.
If you look at things,

2411
01:47:03,990 --> 01:47:06,150
if you have a positive approach,
you can,

2412
01:47:06,180 --> 01:47:11,180
you could look at things in a good way 
and have those things have positive 

2413
01:47:11,191 --> 01:47:13,740
attributes,
have have benefit in those things.

2414
01:47:13,770 --> 01:47:18,770
Or you could look at the exact same 
thing exact same moment your life and 

2415
01:47:18,770 --> 01:47:20,460
just decide that this is the end.
Life is terrible.

2416
01:47:20,461 --> 01:47:25,461
You're a loser and people have these 
deeply grooved patterns that they've 

2417
01:47:25,461 --> 01:47:29,370
carved out in their consciousness over 
years and years of approaching different

2418
01:47:29,371 --> 01:47:34,371
situations with very similar reactions 
and it's almost like automatically like 

2419
01:47:35,041 --> 01:47:37,530
something happens to you.
Everything always goes wrong for me.

2420
01:47:37,590 --> 01:47:38,550
God,
my life sucks.

2421
01:47:38,760 --> 01:47:41,220
I'm such a loser.
But if you compared your life to someone

2422
01:47:41,221 --> 01:47:46,221
who's born in Bangladesh or Ethiopia or 
some someplace where people are like 

2423
01:47:46,440 --> 01:47:50,040
really genuinely unfortunate,
they would be laughing at you.

2424
01:47:50,070 --> 01:47:52,740
They'd be like,
you live in America and you're white and

2425
01:47:52,741 --> 01:47:55,320
you don't have cancer.
We just shut the fuck up.

2426
01:47:55,321 --> 01:48:00,321
You know,
like what's perfect example of that 

2427
01:48:00,321 --> 01:48:00,321
would be a George Costanza,
this character right on,

2428
01:48:00,350 --> 01:48:01,250
on Seinfeld,
right?

2429
01:48:01,580 --> 01:48:03,930
The guy that no matter how good he had 
it,

2430
01:48:03,931 --> 01:48:07,170
he always had managed to screw it up 
somehow and things would always,

2431
01:48:07,350 --> 01:48:10,830
always turned back.
We've all had the experience of being in

2432
01:48:10,831 --> 01:48:13,230
a room and someone would come into the 
room,

2433
01:48:13,380 --> 01:48:18,380
kind of a dark vibe and the whole room 
vibe with shore,

2434
01:48:18,780 --> 01:48:22,380
but then we've also had the experience 
where a guy would come in who was a real

2435
01:48:22,440 --> 01:48:27,440
bright,
positive thinking person and everyone's 

2436
01:48:27,440 --> 01:48:31,130
mood,
but just let that collective conscious 

2437
01:48:31,130 --> 01:48:33,581
you've got to be so aware of because not
every thought that a person has is that 

2438
01:48:33,581 --> 01:48:33,581
wrong.

2439
01:48:33,581 --> 01:48:33,960
You know,
it can come from the outside.

2440
01:48:34,170 --> 01:48:39,170
We don't manufacture our own thoughts.
You can be influenced by negative 

2441
01:48:39,170 --> 01:48:42,831
thinking from other people or positive 
thinking from other people and you got 

2442
01:48:42,831 --> 01:48:46,451
to start to be very conscious of they 
kind of thoughts passing through your 

2443
01:48:46,451 --> 01:48:49,050
brain and reject those negative thoughts
and it's not easy.

2444
01:48:49,340 --> 01:48:54,340
It's a discipline like working out.
It really is and it's also one of the 

2445
01:48:54,340 --> 01:48:56,250
more important aspects about surrounding
yourself with positive people.

2446
01:48:56,550 --> 01:48:58,020
When you surround yourself with positive
people,

2447
01:48:58,021 --> 01:49:00,480
you find them to be inspirational.
You get excited.

2448
01:49:00,481 --> 01:49:05,481
You all think along similar lines.
You support each other and help each 

2449
01:49:05,481 --> 01:49:06,240
other and it benefits everybody and you 
develop.

2450
01:49:06,270 --> 01:49:10,020
You develop like a real keen sense of 
like love and community,

2451
01:49:10,320 --> 01:49:12,360
whereas if you're around people that are
constantly negative,

2452
01:49:12,361 --> 01:49:14,510
like you're,
you're in conflict all the time,

2453
01:49:14,540 --> 01:49:15,180
all the time.

2454
01:49:15,230 --> 01:49:20,230
You're wearing out,
you're constantly getting exhausted too 

2455
01:49:20,230 --> 01:49:20,540
by the stress of an eye.
I have a theory in that too,

2456
01:49:20,541 --> 01:49:21,900
and that's just my theory.
I mean,

2457
01:49:21,901 --> 01:49:23,910
it's part of the mental science we were 
talking about.

2458
01:49:24,350 --> 01:49:26,820
Um,
I believe that those people are the ones

2459
01:49:26,821 --> 01:49:30,490
that attract all sorts of degenerative 
diseases and,

2460
01:49:30,491 --> 01:49:31,050
and,
and,

2461
01:49:31,150 --> 01:49:32,310
uh,
you know,

2462
01:49:32,940 --> 01:49:34,330
bad things happen.
Well,

2463
01:49:34,331 --> 01:49:37,020
it certainly can play a factor,
especially stress,

2464
01:49:37,021 --> 01:49:42,021
you know,
stress has been shown to be devastating 

2465
01:49:42,021 --> 01:49:44,061
to your immune system.
People that have really stressful lives 

2466
01:49:44,061 --> 01:49:47,271
and don't get enough sleep and are 
constantly negative and thinks about 

2467
01:49:47,271 --> 01:49:47,271
things.
Sleep is more important than diet.

2468
01:49:47,340 --> 01:49:48,010
You know,
people

2469
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:50,260
that are overweight,
a man,

2470
01:49:50,320 --> 01:49:55,320
I'll tell you could be in the best diet 
in the world and still having a lot of 

2471
01:49:55,320 --> 01:49:56,620
struggle with weight if you're missing 
your sleep.

2472
01:49:56,860 --> 01:49:58,390
I've seen that many,
many times,

2473
01:49:58,570 --> 01:50:03,570
even with my own clients because I do a 
lot of fat loss programs and you guys 

2474
01:50:03,570 --> 01:50:06,850
will be eating pretty decent and not 
losing the weight and then,

2475
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:07,480
you know,
I'm looking,

2476
01:50:07,481 --> 01:50:08,620
they're only getting like five and a 
half,

2477
01:50:08,621 --> 01:50:10,720
six hours a night and they're really 
stressed.

2478
01:50:11,050 --> 01:50:16,050
You know,
you have a tendency really hold onto 

2479
01:50:16,050 --> 01:50:16,050
water and,
and uh,

2480
01:50:16,050 --> 01:50:16,940
your body will hold onto that body fat.
It's an oil.

2481
01:50:16,950 --> 01:50:21,950
It's hard to dilute.
The of that is an interesting aspect of 

2482
01:50:21,950 --> 01:50:23,140
a lack of sleep is that your body holds 
onto fat.

2483
01:50:23,590 --> 01:50:25,570
It really holds on.
And also fluids,

2484
01:50:25,571 --> 01:50:27,130
you know,
what they call false fat.

2485
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:30,930
It's not even fat is just like all this 
fluid.

2486
01:50:30,931 --> 01:50:35,931
It just gets trapped in the tissues.
It might as well be fat because it's 

2487
01:50:35,931 --> 01:50:37,360
just as unattractive and just as 
uncomfortable,

2488
01:50:37,760 --> 01:50:39,760
you know?
So did you

2489
01:50:39,860 --> 01:50:44,510
bother investigating what this guy is 
doing about this astrology stuff?

2490
01:50:44,511 --> 01:50:45,730
Did you bother looking into it?

2491
01:50:46,160 --> 01:50:47,330
Listen to him.
Well,

2492
01:50:47,340 --> 01:50:49,740
his,
his website is quite interesting.

2493
01:50:49,780 --> 01:50:52,710
Is radiant.
Last is like fantastic.

2494
01:50:52,711 --> 01:50:53,490
You know,
for people.

2495
01:50:53,491 --> 01:50:58,491
What is the astrology itself based on?
It's based on the position of the stars 

2496
01:50:58,491 --> 01:50:58,620
time you were born.
Yeah.

2497
01:50:58,630 --> 01:51:03,630
Haley is Haley heliocentric.
The old astrology with earl was earth 

2498
01:51:03,630 --> 01:51:05,100
based because they believed the earth 
was the center of the universe.

2499
01:51:05,370 --> 01:51:07,710
He created his own Heleo is Hetrick,
you know,

2500
01:51:07,730 --> 01:51:12,730
with the sun is the center and then it's
just basically created his own 

2501
01:51:12,730 --> 01:51:13,350
astrology.
He did.

2502
01:51:14,580 --> 01:51:19,580
How does one do that?
How does one create their own astrology 

2503
01:51:19,580 --> 01:51:19,580
and what?
I couldn't.

2504
01:51:19,580 --> 01:51:23,580
I got almost,
and I would say almost almost understand

2505
01:51:23,671 --> 01:51:28,671
how someone could imagine that if you 
looked at thousands of years of data,

2506
01:51:30,030 --> 01:51:35,030
you could figure out that people develop
certain personality traits if they were 

2507
01:51:35,030 --> 01:51:39,111
born during certain times and you could 
sort of try to align those times with 

2508
01:51:39,360 --> 01:51:42,520
the constellations in the sky that are 
moving and the,

2509
01:51:43,140 --> 01:51:45,960
you know,
just the way the earth wobbles and where

2510
01:51:45,961 --> 01:51:49,950
the stars are at any given moment.
That kind of almost makes sense.

2511
01:51:50,100 --> 01:51:52,750
But this guy doing it on his own,
like,

2512
01:51:52,820 --> 01:51:53,480
how's he doing that?

2513
01:51:53,960 --> 01:51:58,960
You know,
I don't even pretend to really 

2514
01:51:58,960 --> 01:51:58,960
understand it.
What's know what sold me.

2515
01:51:58,960 --> 01:52:01,930
I didn't have said Maui.
He's at valley.

2516
01:52:02,520 --> 01:52:03,110
He did,
I,

2517
01:52:03,120 --> 01:52:05,290
I didn't have to understand it because 
he,

2518
01:52:05,350 --> 01:52:07,870
he basically read mine life to me like a
book.

2519
01:52:08,430 --> 01:52:12,610
It says there's no freaking way that he 
could have known this information.

2520
01:52:12,611 --> 01:52:14,170
What kind of stuff that could he not 
have known.

2521
01:52:15,120 --> 01:52:16,840
Just the way my life went,
man,

2522
01:52:16,870 --> 01:52:19,210
you know,
like my relationship with my parents and

2523
01:52:19,211 --> 01:52:22,390
the relationship with my ex wife and the
way my marriage went,

2524
01:52:22,420 --> 01:52:26,110
a way my marriage dissolved and like,
you know,

2525
01:52:26,370 --> 01:52:29,980
just all sorts of stuff like that.
Like sort of like a Tarot card reader.

2526
01:52:30,670 --> 01:52:35,140
Yeah.
But Tarot card reader is bullshit.

2527
01:52:35,380 --> 01:52:36,730
Yeah,
exactly.

2528
01:52:36,760 --> 01:52:39,530
And this is not bullshit.
I don't have,

2529
01:52:39,730 --> 01:52:44,730
let's put it this way.
He's told me not to do stuff and I've 

2530
01:52:44,730 --> 01:52:45,890
done it and

2531
01:52:46,200 --> 01:52:47,990
never has worked out for me,
man,

2532
01:52:48,340 --> 01:52:53,340
but isn't impossible that one of the 
reasons why it didn't work out because 

2533
01:52:53,340 --> 01:52:56,531
he told you not do it and that you 
thought about it and your negative 

2534
01:52:56,531 --> 01:52:56,540
thinking and negative thinking.

2535
01:52:57,150 --> 01:52:59,330
But like,
and the brand.

2536
01:52:59,360 --> 01:53:01,070
All I know is every time I go against 
him,

2537
01:53:02,390 --> 01:53:05,420
it just usually doesn't work out.
And when I listened to the guy,

2538
01:53:05,630 --> 01:53:07,100
right,
it almost always works out

2539
01:53:07,440 --> 01:53:09,450
right?
But this is sort of contrary.

2540
01:53:09,451 --> 01:53:14,451
This goes along with what you just said,
like you're almost not giving yourself 

2541
01:53:14,451 --> 01:53:15,210
advice.
You're not following your own advice.

2542
01:53:15,510 --> 01:53:20,510
You,
you literally were just talking about 

2543
01:53:20,510 --> 01:53:20,510
thinking about things in a negative way,
like,

2544
01:53:20,510 --> 01:53:25,220
like things are predestined.
So this guy has sort of created these 

2545
01:53:25,220 --> 01:53:25,980
scenarios that you shouldn't,
you shouldn't engage in

2546
01:53:26,370 --> 01:53:28,770
thing.
Like he's told me something on my chart,

2547
01:53:29,010 --> 01:53:34,010
right?
And then I'll call them a day or two 

2548
01:53:34,010 --> 01:53:34,890
later and just completely changed your 
charts changed.

2549
01:53:34,920 --> 01:53:35,340
Yeah.
Like,

2550
01:53:35,341 --> 01:53:36,480
something changed.
And I says,

2551
01:53:36,481 --> 01:53:37,260
well,
wait a second,

2552
01:53:37,290 --> 01:53:39,360
two days ago you said I shouldn't do 
this.

2553
01:53:39,480 --> 01:53:43,830
Now you're saying it's okay.
He claims it's like quantum physics,

2554
01:53:43,831 --> 01:53:48,831
right?
If you change your thought or your 

2555
01:53:48,831 --> 01:53:50,940
vibration level,
he actually sees a change on his chart,

2556
01:53:50,941 --> 01:53:52,350
on his computer.
What?

2557
01:53:52,650 --> 01:53:54,510
Yeah.
Okay.

2558
01:53:54,511 --> 01:53:57,270
This makes zero sense.
Well,

2559
01:53:57,271 --> 01:53:59,250
I'll give you another example of how 
this might work.

2560
01:54:00,080 --> 01:54:02,250
I had,
I had this guy that was a,

2561
01:54:02,251 --> 01:54:02,600
uh,
uh,

2562
01:54:02,620 --> 01:54:04,820
by a professor of,
uh,

2563
01:54:04,830 --> 01:54:05,130
he was,
uh,

2564
01:54:05,150 --> 01:54:10,150
actually a phd in biochemistry and Board
Certified Nutritionist Name is Dr 

2565
01:54:10,150 --> 01:54:12,480
Gregory House and uh,
he used to take hair samples,

2566
01:54:12,930 --> 01:54:17,930
right.
And he would test these things out for 

2567
01:54:17,930 --> 01:54:17,930
like various deficiencies,
this,

2568
01:54:17,930 --> 01:54:17,930
that,
and the other thing.

2569
01:54:17,930 --> 01:54:19,260
Right.
And he,

2570
01:54:19,860 --> 01:54:21,090
he,
he was into this,

2571
01:54:21,091 --> 01:54:22,070
um,
uh,

2572
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:23,560
electric.
Uh,

2573
01:54:24,090 --> 01:54:29,090
basically I am attached that hair 
forever and as my body would change,

2574
01:54:30,900 --> 01:54:34,500
the hair sample would change even though
I was no longer connected to it.

2575
01:54:35,180 --> 01:54:40,180
Change how it,
it would no longer show the deficiency 

2576
01:54:40,180 --> 01:54:40,180
when he would retest it.

2577
01:54:40,180 --> 01:54:40,720
Why?
Uh,

2578
01:54:40,730 --> 01:54:41,640
I know,
man,

2579
01:54:41,641 --> 01:54:43,500
it's crazy.
Crazy shit.

2580
01:54:43,650 --> 01:54:46,710
Not Violent.
He was a hardcore scientist man.

2581
01:54:46,720 --> 01:54:50,910
PHB just set up tumor.
This doesn't make any sense.

2582
01:54:50,911 --> 01:54:52,140
I just,
I don't buy that.

2583
01:54:52,290 --> 01:54:53,730
It doesn't make sense.
Your,

2584
01:54:53,760 --> 01:54:58,760
your,
your physical hair is not going to 

2585
01:54:58,760 --> 01:54:58,760
change.
Changed what actually changed?

2586
01:54:58,760 --> 01:54:59,490
I don't believe it.
Well,

2587
01:54:59,491 --> 01:54:59,840
I,
I,

2588
01:54:59,940 --> 01:55:02,400
I had trouble believing in myself.
Did you see it?

2589
01:55:02,690 --> 01:55:03,780
You know,
for a fact,

2590
01:55:03,781 --> 01:55:05,670
if you read into it,
if you looked at data,

2591
01:55:05,760 --> 01:55:10,230
I tested really actually understand the 
process,

2592
01:55:10,350 --> 01:55:13,260
right?
But I knew him not to be a liar.

2593
01:55:13,261 --> 01:55:14,370
He was.
He was sure he's not,

2594
01:55:14,371 --> 01:55:17,010
but he might just be delusional.
So looking at something like that,

2595
01:55:17,011 --> 01:55:19,350
you're talking about something that 
defies physics.

2596
01:55:19,440 --> 01:55:24,440
It defies science,
Physics that completely through physics 

2597
01:55:24,440 --> 01:55:24,560
on its ear,
right?

2598
01:55:24,561 --> 01:55:28,020
But we know that electronic can occupy 
more than one space,

2599
01:55:28,410 --> 01:55:32,670
which now opens up the whole door for 
parallel universes,

2600
01:55:33,100 --> 01:55:38,100
all sorts of stuff.
Stephen Hawkings just recently claimed 

2601
01:55:38,100 --> 01:55:42,060
that the black holes are like a door 
from one universe to another.

2602
01:55:43,110 --> 01:55:44,190
So there's all this crazy

2603
01:55:44,190 --> 01:55:46,110
stuff.
They just put everything on end.

2604
01:55:46,111 --> 01:55:50,910
What we know about physics and medicine 
and everything else.

2605
01:55:51,210 --> 01:55:56,210
I believe there's one called vibrational
medicine that they actually talk about 

2606
01:55:56,210 --> 01:55:56,610
this.
Check out that book,

2607
01:55:56,611 --> 01:55:57,180
right?
But see,

2608
01:55:57,181 --> 01:56:02,181
here's the problem where you're not 
testing subatomic particles when we're 

2609
01:56:02,181 --> 01:56:03,690
testing hair,
when you touch someone's hair and you're

2610
01:56:03,691 --> 01:56:06,480
testing here for various mineral 
deficiencies in vitamins,

2611
01:56:06,930 --> 01:56:09,600
those things aren't flying through the 
air and going back and forth.

2612
01:56:09,810 --> 01:56:11,930
So if you're here,
he was actually,

2613
01:56:11,970 --> 01:56:13,880
he was actually testing it,
the,

2614
01:56:13,930 --> 01:56:17,190
the vibrational level of the hair.
What does that mean?

2615
01:56:17,360 --> 01:56:19,910
Like it,
like everything puts off like a,

2616
01:56:19,980 --> 01:56:24,980
like an aura.
You can photograph it with Kirlian 

2617
01:56:24,980 --> 01:56:25,620
photography.
You can actually photograph the energy.

2618
01:56:25,650 --> 01:56:27,450
You know everything has an aura.
Even this cup,

2619
01:56:27,550 --> 01:56:30,600
this table,
your body and aura that you can actually

2620
01:56:30,601 --> 01:56:35,601
prove a real aura or the someone who 
believes they've actually taken pictures

2621
01:56:35,701 --> 01:56:35,940
of it.

2622
01:56:36,270 --> 01:56:39,120
You've heard the Kirlian photography 
know how to spell that.

2623
01:56:39,300 --> 01:56:40,890
A fuck.
How do you spell that?

2624
01:56:40,920 --> 01:56:45,920
Kirlian photography and they actually 
have taken pictures of this and he can 

2625
01:56:46,920 --> 01:56:51,920
actually measure the energy coming off 
this and it matched me.

2626
01:56:52,770 --> 01:56:57,770
But Jamie's a photographer.
Jamie's should know about Kirlian 

2627
01:56:57,770 --> 01:56:57,770
photography.
Ever hear about that Shit Jamie?

2628
01:56:57,770 --> 01:57:02,660
I can't say I've ever heard of.
Have you ever tried to bang some chick 

2629
01:57:02,660 --> 01:57:02,660
was really into crystals of it's to talk
to you about it.

2630
01:57:03,420 --> 01:57:04,410
Check it out.
Anyway,

2631
01:57:04,411 --> 01:57:08,100
that's.
It's pretty simple and it works for me,

2632
01:57:08,101 --> 01:57:13,101
man.
Well I understand that it probably has 

2633
01:57:13,101 --> 01:57:13,680
its application in the mind,
the power of the mind.

2634
01:57:13,681 --> 01:57:16,080
So.
But is it a big giant placebo effect?

2635
01:57:16,230 --> 01:57:17,940
I don't know.
I do know this.

2636
01:57:17,941 --> 01:57:20,550
In a recent study,
they found that placebo drugs work about

2637
01:57:20,551 --> 01:57:24,900
40 percent better than real drugs.
What test is this?

2638
01:57:24,930 --> 01:57:25,500
Uh,
there was,

2639
01:57:25,501 --> 01:57:28,580
uh,
there was a thing that I did mushrooms.

2640
01:57:28,590 --> 01:57:30,310
I read a whole.
They,

2641
01:57:30,380 --> 01:57:32,760
they've given people like regular 
medication,

2642
01:57:32,761 --> 01:57:34,140
you know,
from pharmaceutical stuff.

2643
01:57:34,380 --> 01:57:39,380
They found that placebos work way better
for what application though.

2644
01:57:40,140 --> 01:57:42,290
You know what I'm saying?
Like when you say that it,

2645
01:57:42,360 --> 01:57:47,360
the placebos worked way better for 
relief and pain relief makes sense 

2646
01:57:48,480 --> 01:57:52,200
because a lot of pain relief you can 
actually do with your own mind.

2647
01:57:52,410 --> 01:57:57,410
I don't take pain pills.
I got knee surgery and I didn't take a 

2648
01:57:57,410 --> 01:58:02,241
damn thing.
I just read so many negative side 

2649
01:58:02,241 --> 01:58:04,560
effects of the Ibuprofen and the this 
kind of stuff.

2650
01:58:04,561 --> 01:58:09,561
Well,
Ibuprofen would say probably the safest 

2651
01:58:09,561 --> 01:58:09,561
evolve them.
And it's still not good for you.

2652
01:58:09,561 --> 01:58:13,160
But my fear was always,
I just knew too many people that got 

2653
01:58:13,160 --> 01:58:13,160
addicted to pain pills.
And I'm like,

2654
01:58:13,160 --> 01:58:13,310
well,
what's,

2655
01:58:13,350 --> 01:58:15,240
what's the worst part about pain?

2656
01:58:15,240 --> 01:58:17,430
It just doesn't feel good.
Well,

2657
01:58:17,940 --> 01:58:22,940
isn't that just okay?
Can you just deal with not feeling good 

2658
01:58:22,940 --> 01:58:25,821
while you heal like the least.
Now I know I'm in pain because I'm 

2659
01:58:25,821 --> 01:58:27,630
healing.
An awful lot of pain is cut,

2660
01:58:27,760 --> 01:58:32,760
you know,
a mind thing like how you approach the 

2661
01:58:32,760 --> 01:58:33,570
signal that,
that back pain guy,

2662
01:58:33,850 --> 01:58:37,800
uh,
but also the steward,

2663
01:58:37,801 --> 01:58:42,801
Miguel de,
they were looking at x rays that 

2664
01:58:42,801 --> 01:58:44,691
people's backs and you know,
people with chronic back pain a lot of 

2665
01:58:44,691 --> 01:58:46,570
times it would not have any physical 
reason to be in back,

2666
01:58:46,820 --> 01:58:48,040
back pain.
Right.

2667
01:58:48,250 --> 01:58:50,090
And then they were all at,
you know,

2668
01:58:50,830 --> 01:58:54,520
pictures of guys that were active like 
us and their backs are a mess.

2669
01:58:54,521 --> 01:58:59,521
All sorts of slipped disc and the guys 
are not in any pain at all and it must 

2670
01:58:59,521 --> 01:58:59,890
be afraid of we'll get an x ray on my 
back,

2671
01:58:59,891 --> 01:59:00,180
you know?

2672
01:59:00,520 --> 01:59:01,380
Yeah.
Right.

2673
01:59:02,730 --> 01:59:03,750
Yeah,
right.

2674
01:59:03,760 --> 01:59:07,750
If anybody would have a messed up back,
it got to be me all the falls and throws

2675
01:59:07,751 --> 01:59:12,751
up taking over 45 years of wrestling 
users using little tiny micro injury 

2676
01:59:13,100 --> 01:59:15,160
constantly.
But yet I'm not in any pain at all.

2677
01:59:15,370 --> 01:59:16,120
Yeah.
Well,

2678
01:59:16,121 --> 01:59:20,560
pain is an interesting thing in that I 
think the mind can regulate pain,

2679
01:59:20,561 --> 01:59:24,040
so that's what I meant by 
pharmaceuticals,

2680
01:59:24,310 --> 01:59:27,170
but it doesn't make sense with other 
applications where we,

2681
01:59:27,180 --> 01:59:32,180
you know,
we find like anti epileptic medications 

2682
01:59:32,180 --> 01:59:34,951
or things along those lines where you 
just know for a fact as a physical 

2683
01:59:34,951 --> 01:59:38,851
effect on the body that these drugs have
and that they don't understand placebo 

2684
01:59:38,851 --> 01:59:39,710
effect.
You know,

2685
01:59:39,711 --> 01:59:44,711
that's one thing for sure.
They know that placebo effect is real 

2686
01:59:44,711 --> 01:59:45,970
and it does work in certain 
circumstances is the power of the mind.

2687
01:59:46,190 --> 01:59:51,190
Well,
it especially dependent upon who is 

2688
01:59:51,190 --> 01:59:52,560
receiving that effect and you know how 
much the person believes in this thing's

2689
01:59:52,570 --> 01:59:53,200
gonna heal them.

2690
01:59:53,560 --> 01:59:55,030
And if people,
you know,

2691
01:59:55,900 --> 02:00:00,900
what I find is a lot of people are 
really into the body but they're not 

2692
02:00:00,900 --> 02:00:02,620
really working with their mind or their 
thoughts are or anything like that.

2693
02:00:02,890 --> 02:00:04,360
You know,
it takes a lot of discipline.

2694
02:00:04,390 --> 02:00:05,620
It does,
but it also,

2695
02:00:05,680 --> 02:00:08,800
you really have to clearly establish 
what's woo,

2696
02:00:08,830 --> 02:00:13,830
what's nutty,
crazy crystal bullshit and what is an 

2697
02:00:13,830 --> 02:00:16,840
applicable modality like what is,
what,

2698
02:00:16,870 --> 02:00:21,870
what can you really do as far as 
meditation as far as things that are 

2699
02:00:21,870 --> 02:00:25,931
repeatable,
things that people have shown to have a 

2700
02:00:25,931 --> 02:00:29,101
beneficial effect on your consciousness,
a beneficial effect on the way you 

2701
02:00:29,101 --> 02:00:29,620
approach life.
And um,

2702
02:00:29,890 --> 02:00:33,340
and that is pretty much individually it 
is,

2703
02:00:33,370 --> 02:00:34,540
you know,
you really have to,

2704
02:00:34,600 --> 02:00:39,600
like you said,
you self experimentation one I just 

2705
02:00:39,600 --> 02:00:40,930
talked about might sound pretty damn 
weird to a lot of people,

2706
02:00:41,080 --> 02:00:45,700
but so far it's been working for me well
as long as I feel good about it.

2707
02:00:45,870 --> 02:00:50,870
Yeah.
And I don't feel like it diminishes my 

2708
02:00:50,870 --> 02:00:52,330
life in any way.
No one's taken advantage of me,

2709
02:00:52,840 --> 02:00:53,680
uh,
you know,

2710
02:00:53,681 --> 02:00:58,681
um,
I feel like confident and really good 

2711
02:00:58,681 --> 02:01:02,020
about those type of information I'm 
getting and I found it worked.

2712
02:01:02,021 --> 02:01:04,360
But like you say,
power of the mind.

2713
02:01:04,361 --> 02:01:04,940
Well,
if you,

2714
02:01:04,941 --> 02:01:06,790
if you just approach it on that level,
if you say,

2715
02:01:06,791 --> 02:01:11,791
okay,
this guy's going to give me advice and 

2716
02:01:11,791 --> 02:01:13,920
I'm going to find this advice to be 
beneficial and I'm going to follow 

2717
02:01:13,920 --> 02:01:16,291
through with it and I'm gonna use that 
as a guideline and I'm going to have 

2718
02:01:16,291 --> 02:01:19,080
good confidence in that.
These choices are going to be correct 

2719
02:01:19,080 --> 02:01:21,901
because of this guy and his knowledge.
And my problem is I've just,

2720
02:01:22,240 --> 02:01:24,550
I've seen too much bullshit.
And so,

2721
02:01:24,800 --> 02:01:29,800
um,
whatever beliefs I might've had like 

2722
02:01:29,800 --> 02:01:29,800
even six years ago before I started this
podcast,

2723
02:01:29,800 --> 02:01:31,810
a lot of them have eroded just under 
scrutiny.

2724
02:01:31,840 --> 02:01:32,850
Just understand.
No,

2725
02:01:32,860 --> 02:01:35,320
I hear Ya.
I always advise people,

2726
02:01:35,440 --> 02:01:38,230
give the guy a call.
The first session is free.

2727
02:01:38,410 --> 02:01:41,240
If you think he's a crackpot,
never call them again.

2728
02:01:41,330 --> 02:01:42,050
Yeah,
but I mean,

2729
02:01:42,110 --> 02:01:44,970
what I would want to do my problem with 
someone like that as I want,

2730
02:01:45,080 --> 02:01:47,180
I would want to go down the rabbit hole.
I would want to find out,

2731
02:01:47,181 --> 02:01:48,980
okay,
how are you making these distinctions?

2732
02:01:48,981 --> 02:01:49,900
Like what,
what,

2733
02:01:49,940 --> 02:01:53,210
how did you devise this method?
What's going on behind the scenes?

2734
02:01:53,211 --> 02:01:55,010
What do you base this on?
How do you know?

2735
02:01:55,011 --> 02:02:00,011
What are you saying?
Like what are you saying when you tell 

2736
02:02:00,011 --> 02:02:00,011
someone,
hey,

2737
02:02:00,011 --> 02:02:00,650
don't take that flight to Germany 
because something bad's going to happen.

2738
02:02:00,651 --> 02:02:05,651
Like who the fuck are you?
How do you know that you don't know 

2739
02:02:05,651 --> 02:02:08,621
that?
And that's the reality is you tell 

2740
02:02:08,621 --> 02:02:08,621
someone don't do something.
If you tell someone,

2741
02:02:08,621 --> 02:02:13,121
hey steve,
I really don't think you should go to 

2742
02:02:13,121 --> 02:02:13,121
Florida.

2743
02:02:13,121 --> 02:02:13,121
Oh fuck.
God says I shouldn't go to Florida.

2744
02:02:13,121 --> 02:02:15,950
You're already starting at cascade of 
negative thoughts and that,

2745
02:02:16,160 --> 02:02:19,460
to me that is a very good point.
And I had thought about that.

2746
02:02:19,490 --> 02:02:21,350
You know yet.
Well there's not a fucking person in the

2747
02:02:21,351 --> 02:02:26,351
world that can tell you that if you pick
up your car keys and drive your car to 

2748
02:02:26,351 --> 02:02:27,560
Minnesota,
something's gonna go wrong.

2749
02:02:27,650 --> 02:02:30,470
So if this guy's telling you that I call
bullshit,

2750
02:02:30,680 --> 02:02:35,680
not only do I call bullshit,
but I think that that kind of stuff was 

2751
02:02:35,680 --> 02:02:37,670
kind of dangerous because what he's 
looking at it is like,

2752
02:02:37,930 --> 02:02:42,930
you know,
you were really influenced by the 

2753
02:02:42,930 --> 02:02:42,930
collective a lot,
you know,

2754
02:02:42,930 --> 02:02:44,360
like people's general moods and stuff.
He gives me like a little heads up,

2755
02:02:44,390 --> 02:02:49,390
he's able to see that helps you.
Like if I wanted to do a seminar to a 

2756
02:02:49,390 --> 02:02:54,071
certain date and he'll look at the 
charts and he'll just say energy is 

2757
02:02:54,071 --> 02:02:54,080
pretty off that.

2758
02:02:54,110 --> 02:02:55,040
Okay,
but what does that mean?

2759
02:02:55,070 --> 02:02:56,840
The energy is pretty often looking at 
the charts.

2760
02:02:56,841 --> 02:02:57,920
What does that mean?
What does that mean?

2761
02:02:57,921 --> 02:03:00,410
But it's looking at it.
I might be tired.

2762
02:03:00,440 --> 02:03:02,750
I don't know.
I haven't seen these charts,

2763
02:03:03,020 --> 02:03:05,630
but I hear them clicking in the 
background and the computer that guys on

2764
02:03:05,631 --> 02:03:08,810
facebook,
he's looking at pictures going on.

2765
02:03:08,811 --> 02:03:11,320
You just checking out girls assets.
GimMe a call.

2766
02:03:11,420 --> 02:03:12,840
No fucking way.
No.

2767
02:03:13,310 --> 02:03:14,120
Yeah,
I don't care.

2768
02:03:14,121 --> 02:03:15,470
I've got.
Time is not.

2769
02:03:15,500 --> 02:03:20,500
Time is valuable.
I just think there's a guy in the world 

2770
02:03:20,500 --> 02:03:22,070
that can look at a chart and tell you 
where the energy of the world is.

2771
02:03:22,240 --> 02:03:23,840
I think there is man.
Really?

2772
02:03:23,841 --> 02:03:27,660
I've experienced it.
So this guy know you.

2773
02:03:28,370 --> 02:03:32,810
That's why I'm questioning this wacky 
guy who's out of a suitcase.

2774
02:03:33,380 --> 02:03:36,920
Maybe that's enough to.
I think you're a beautiful,

2775
02:03:36,921 --> 02:03:38,180
brilliant man.
But uh,

2776
02:03:38,330 --> 02:03:40,280
if I was your friend and I was,
I am your friend,

2777
02:03:40,281 --> 02:03:42,020
but if I was there while this was going 
down,

2778
02:03:42,470 --> 02:03:45,260
I would be asking this guy a fuck load 
of questions.

2779
02:03:45,710 --> 02:03:49,260
I do find he's a really good guys I've 
talked to about stuff too.

2780
02:03:49,520 --> 02:03:54,520
He's almost like a kinda like a 
psychologist or a psychiatrist in a way 

2781
02:03:54,520 --> 02:03:57,730
is like an ancient times.
The scientists were philosophers and all

2782
02:03:57,731 --> 02:04:00,680
the great.
Even Alexander the Great and you know,

2783
02:04:00,830 --> 02:04:03,410
uh,
all the great Roman emperors,

2784
02:04:03,411 --> 02:04:04,360
you know,
uh,

2785
02:04:04,400 --> 02:04:08,330
they would have their own private 
philosophers to advise them on things.

2786
02:04:08,331 --> 02:04:13,331
Mark Israelis for example,
and they would listen to these 

2787
02:04:13,331 --> 02:04:15,941
philosophers.
I kind of look at this guy almost as a 

2788
02:04:15,941 --> 02:04:15,941
philosophy,
as an advisor,

2789
02:04:15,941 --> 02:04:17,660
an advisor,
and I can buy that.

2790
02:04:17,661 --> 02:04:21,530
I haven't always taken and I have gone 
against the guy.

2791
02:04:21,800 --> 02:04:24,440
Like in what way?
I just didn't listen to what he said,

2792
02:04:25,110 --> 02:04:26,060
hey,
get my advice.

2793
02:04:26,061 --> 02:04:31,061
Don't do the seminar this weekend.
Why would he tell you not to do a 

2794
02:04:31,061 --> 02:04:31,061
seminar?
And he said,

2795
02:04:31,061 --> 02:04:35,170
this is bullshit.
It would be a better day to do it in 

2796
02:04:35,170 --> 02:04:35,170
this day.

2797
02:04:35,170 --> 02:04:35,170
Oh fuck.
Why,

2798
02:04:35,170 --> 02:04:40,060
you know it's Voodoo because he threw 
chicken bones in the ground and one of 

2799
02:04:40,060 --> 02:04:43,821
the sticks,
I have done it and it would be not such 

2800
02:04:43,831 --> 02:04:48,831
a good one.
Maybe he told you that it was going to 

2801
02:04:48,831 --> 02:04:48,831
be a bad one.
You had it in your head.

2802
02:04:48,831 --> 02:04:49,590
Then you went and did it.
Maybe.

2803
02:04:49,740 --> 02:04:51,150
Has He ever told you not to do 
something?

2804
02:04:51,151 --> 02:04:53,190
He did and it worked out awesome.
No,

2805
02:04:53,790 --> 02:04:55,680
that's what made me think.
Well,

2806
02:04:55,681 --> 02:05:00,681
it's because you're thinking about it.
What we talked about with negative 

2807
02:05:00,681 --> 02:05:04,521
thoughts,
maybe maybe more likely than a fucking 

2808
02:05:04,521 --> 02:05:08,570
chart can tell you the energy of the 
universe doesn't want you to fly to 

2809
02:05:08,570 --> 02:05:09,270
Miami.
That's crazy.

2810
02:05:09,810 --> 02:05:11,990
There's some pretty brilliant guys out 
there that,

2811
02:05:12,090 --> 02:05:13,560
that knows stuff that we don't,
man.

2812
02:05:14,630 --> 02:05:16,560
Um,
yes.

2813
02:05:16,561 --> 02:05:19,530
There's definitely some brilliant stuff 
that we know,

2814
02:05:19,680 --> 02:05:24,680
but this one guy that's got a computer 
that can tap into the collective energy 

2815
02:05:24,680 --> 02:05:27,180
of the universe and tell you where the,
where the energy is and what.

2816
02:05:27,330 --> 02:05:29,790
You should definitely not go to Ohio.
I've looked at your charts.

2817
02:05:29,820 --> 02:05:31,920
Fuck you.
That's what I'd say to that guy.

2818
02:05:31,921 --> 02:05:34,410
Fuck you.
Haven't you crazy man?

2819
02:05:34,440 --> 02:05:38,880
Haven't you ever gone and done a set in 
your show and it just kind of bombed,

2820
02:05:38,881 --> 02:05:41,160
you know,
it just didn't work out that if anything

2821
02:05:41,190 --> 02:05:44,340
ever went wrong,
there are a bunch of reasons why it went

2822
02:05:44,341 --> 02:05:48,960
wrong and I could look at all of them.
I could say maybe I was tired,

2823
02:05:49,110 --> 02:05:51,990
maybe I was overworked.
Maybe I didn't prepare well enough.

2824
02:05:52,020 --> 02:05:54,270
Maybe I have new material that's not 
worked out,

2825
02:05:54,271 --> 02:05:56,910
but it's not because I shouldn't have 
gone to Ohio.

2826
02:05:57,300 --> 02:06:02,300
You know what I'm saying?
It's not because some guy shows me a 

2827
02:06:02,300 --> 02:06:02,300
chart and the collective energy of the 
universe is that,

2828
02:06:02,300 --> 02:06:06,800
but just maybe there are people,
this guy in particular that could 

2829
02:06:07,920 --> 02:06:11,850
potentially write,
have seen that for sure.

2830
02:06:11,910 --> 02:06:16,910
What the set going back,
wouldn't you want to have a hold on a 

2831
02:06:18,001 --> 02:06:20,000
second because this is very important.
Well,

2832
02:06:20,060 --> 02:06:25,060
where do you want to have a method that 
you would clearly understand how this 

2833
02:06:25,060 --> 02:06:26,730
guy's making these arbitrary decisions 
and choices?

2834
02:06:26,731 --> 02:06:28,500
Because you're.
You're talking about bullshit.

2835
02:06:28,890 --> 02:06:30,960
You're talking about like Voodoo.
All right,

2836
02:06:31,140 --> 02:06:33,330
and if you're talking about,
if it's not bullshit,

2837
02:06:33,331 --> 02:06:34,920
then it's science.
So if it's science,

2838
02:06:34,921 --> 02:06:39,921
it's repeatable and you should bring it 
to people that are experts and they 

2839
02:06:39,921 --> 02:06:43,131
should analyze it and study it,
but for this guy to just sit there and 

2840
02:06:43,131 --> 02:06:43,530
click on some things and tell you,
don't go to Ohio.

2841
02:06:43,920 --> 02:06:45,180
That's bullshit.
Well,

2842
02:06:45,181 --> 02:06:46,890
all I can say is this work for me so 
far.

2843
02:06:48,840 --> 02:06:50,610
The proof is in the pudding as far as 
I'm concerned.

2844
02:06:50,640 --> 02:06:51,690
Okay.
If you.

2845
02:06:51,750 --> 02:06:56,750
Your mind decides that something will 
work out well and you have full 

2846
02:06:56,750 --> 02:07:01,101
confidence and your playing doesn't get 
hit by a meteor and everybody gets out 

2847
02:07:01,101 --> 02:07:03,420
alive and at the end of the seminar or 
the end of the trip that you took,

2848
02:07:03,630 --> 02:07:04,410
you say,
hey,

2849
02:07:04,620 --> 02:07:07,050
that guy's advice really turned out 
well.

2850
02:07:07,050 --> 02:07:08,370
It really did.
What you've done,

2851
02:07:08,400 --> 02:07:13,400
you've done it.
You basically give yourself a little 

2852
02:07:13,400 --> 02:07:13,400
mental shield to go into battle with.
Well,

2853
02:07:13,400 --> 02:07:14,220
there we go with.
That's what it is,

2854
02:07:14,221 --> 02:07:15,870
but it's not real.
Do you know what I'm saying?

2855
02:07:15,871 --> 02:07:18,520
Plus I have that mental shield,
isn't it though?

2856
02:07:18,900 --> 02:07:20,430
Well,
it is real.

2857
02:07:20,670 --> 02:07:25,670
It is in the sense that it was effective
because you had confidence in it and 

2858
02:07:25,670 --> 02:07:28,560
because you approached all of these 
events like you had confidence in it,

2859
02:07:28,800 --> 02:07:33,800
but is it real in that there's a guy who
actually can look at a computer and tell

2860
02:07:33,841 --> 02:07:36,160
you whether or not you should go 
somewhere based on the energy

2861
02:07:36,160 --> 02:07:37,510
of the universe?
No,

2862
02:07:37,690 --> 02:07:38,680
no.
That's not real.

2863
02:07:38,950 --> 02:07:43,950
It's definitely not real.
I will tell you with 100 percent 

2864
02:07:43,950 --> 02:07:46,171
confidence it's not real.
Do you know how I know it's not real 

2865
02:07:46,171 --> 02:07:46,360
because there are millions of brilliant 
people out there,

2866
02:07:46,361 --> 02:07:51,361
millions of scientists and Co and we 
talk about quantum physicists and 

2867
02:07:51,361 --> 02:07:51,361
theorists and all these different 
people.

2868
02:07:51,460 --> 02:07:56,460
They would have heard of this.
If you're talking about the guy who's 

2869
02:07:56,460 --> 02:07:56,770
making a computer program,
they would analyze this.

2870
02:07:56,771 --> 02:07:58,690
It would be something that people would 
be talking about.

2871
02:07:58,840 --> 02:08:01,650
If this guy really believes it,
he wouldn't just be holding onto it.

2872
02:08:01,651 --> 02:08:03,250
In Maui,
he would be telling the world,

2873
02:08:03,251 --> 02:08:08,251
listen,
there is a way where you can accurately 

2874
02:08:08,251 --> 02:08:08,251
predict events.
There is a way in you.

2875
02:08:08,251 --> 02:08:10,750
It would be up to peer review.
People would be studying it,

2876
02:08:10,900 --> 02:08:15,900
they would be putting out papers on it.
It would be something where we would 

2877
02:08:15,900 --> 02:08:15,900
understand,
we have figured out a code,

2878
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,310
whether it's like the fibonacci sequence
or something like that,

2879
02:08:18,311 --> 02:08:21,100
a code to the universe and if you follow
this code,

2880
02:08:21,220 --> 02:08:24,640
you have predictable,
repeatable events.

2881
02:08:24,700 --> 02:08:27,880
How do we know that there aren't a lot 
of people are doing it is the problem.

2882
02:08:27,881 --> 02:08:29,650
This is a problem,
this phrasing that you're using,

2883
02:08:29,651 --> 02:08:34,651
how do we know it could be?
It could be it's not enough to base your

2884
02:08:34,991 --> 02:08:39,991
life and any decisions and this will 
will bullshit that comes along with 

2885
02:08:39,991 --> 02:08:41,980
Tarot card reading with palm reading,
with all that stuff.

2886
02:08:42,610 --> 02:08:46,120
It's all the same and it's all one 
person telling you.

2887
02:08:46,180 --> 02:08:51,180
First of all,
he's telling you stuff you already knew 

2888
02:08:51,180 --> 02:08:51,180
about your life.
Okay?

2889
02:08:51,180 --> 02:08:54,750
This is the strategy of charlatans.
I mean this is what Tarot card readers 

2890
02:08:54,750 --> 02:08:57,070
do and palm readers do and fortune 
tellers do.

2891
02:08:57,250 --> 02:09:02,250
They tell you shit they are that you 
already know and they tell you it 

2892
02:09:02,250 --> 02:09:05,611
through leading questions and they tell 
you it through a bunch of signs that 

2893
02:09:05,611 --> 02:09:07,600
they can tell for being really good at 
reading people.

2894
02:09:07,840 --> 02:09:12,840
Then they go on to tell you what's going
to happen or what you should and 

2895
02:09:12,840 --> 02:09:16,951
shouldn't do,
and in doing that you can plant some 

2896
02:09:16,951 --> 02:09:18,130
thoughts and seeds of doubt into 
people's head.

2897
02:09:18,340 --> 02:09:23,340
This is the reason why people used to 
think that someone could put a hex on 

2898
02:09:23,340 --> 02:09:26,101
you because if I put a hex on you and 
you believe I put a hex on you and you 

2899
02:09:26,101 --> 02:09:27,810
leave this room and you're like,
I am fucked Joe.

2900
02:09:27,880 --> 02:09:30,030
Just put a hex on me and we went around 
in life.

2901
02:09:30,190 --> 02:09:34,630
That will be overwhelming your thoughts 
and if you allow that to happen,

2902
02:09:34,660 --> 02:09:39,660
it will be true.
You can manifest bad things by having 

2903
02:09:39,660 --> 02:09:43,831
bad energy and bad ideas.
This is exactly what you were talking 

2904
02:09:43,831 --> 02:09:46,630
about earlier,
but this is done through like a strategy

2905
02:09:46,631 --> 02:09:47,410
and a in a,
in a,

2906
02:09:47,500 --> 02:09:49,660
in a repeatable pattern.
Well,

2907
02:09:50,620 --> 02:09:52,480
oh,
I can say is maybe it works.

2908
02:09:52,650 --> 02:09:54,430
Maybe five,
man.

2909
02:09:54,970 --> 02:09:57,790
Crazy talk,
that's not as crazy as just say.

2910
02:09:58,110 --> 02:09:59,530
Um,
it's definitely crazy.

2911
02:09:59,650 --> 02:10:01,750
Okay.
I'm certified crazy.

2912
02:10:01,780 --> 02:10:02,410
Well,
it's just,

2913
02:10:02,560 --> 02:10:04,840
if there's a method to it,
like if this guy says,

2914
02:10:04,870 --> 02:10:06,430
oh,
here's the reason why,

2915
02:10:06,460 --> 02:10:08,470
the reason why is,
you know,

2916
02:10:08,500 --> 02:10:12,640
there's a,
like the golden sequence of the universe

2917
02:10:12,641 --> 02:10:17,641
and you can tap that golden sequence 
into a computer and it's based upon all 

2918
02:10:17,641 --> 02:10:22,051
these different factors.
If that guy has information like that 

2919
02:10:22,051 --> 02:10:25,141
and he's,
he's just holding onto it and Maui or 

2920
02:10:25,141 --> 02:10:25,270
wherever the fuck he is and he travels.
I got.

2921
02:10:25,370 --> 02:10:25,970
Yeah.
Yeah.

2922
02:10:26,160 --> 02:10:28,180
Just kind of a,
a nomad by the way.

2923
02:10:28,181 --> 02:10:30,040
Someone who went to Stanford and there's
a professor,

2924
02:10:30,041 --> 02:10:32,110
it doesn't exclude them from being out 
of their fucking mind.

2925
02:10:32,410 --> 02:10:34,040
Dr Oz is on TV

2926
02:10:34,040 --> 02:10:35,990
and he's telling people about weight 
loss medication.

2927
02:10:35,991 --> 02:10:40,991
That's a miracle.
And that fucking guy had to go to 

2928
02:10:40,991 --> 02:10:40,991
Congress about it.
Guess what?

2929
02:10:40,991 --> 02:10:44,710
He still on TV,
the guys on TV telling people about 

2930
02:10:44,710 --> 02:10:46,760
miracle weightloss fucking berries.
It's bullshit.

2931
02:10:46,761 --> 02:10:47,870
He's a,
he's a charlatan,

2932
02:10:47,960 --> 02:10:50,240
right?
Tons and tons and tons of guys out there

2933
02:10:50,241 --> 02:10:50,990
selling,
you know,

2934
02:10:50,991 --> 02:10:52,850
there's,
there's this kind of stuff as you know,

2935
02:10:52,851 --> 02:10:57,851
I'm pretty much an anti supplement guy 
and I just feel you used to take a lot 

2936
02:10:57,851 --> 02:11:01,661
of sort of $120 worth of supplements a 
month and I didn't notice a damn thing 

2937
02:11:02,871 --> 02:11:06,230
when I stopped taking all of that shit.
No one thing.

2938
02:11:06,260 --> 02:11:09,320
In fact I felt better felt.
That's interesting.

2939
02:11:09,730 --> 02:11:11,520
And once again,
you know,

2940
02:11:11,540 --> 02:11:16,540
a lot of this is placebo,
you know there is some but there's also 

2941
02:11:16,540 --> 02:11:20,561
some that's been proven by science to 
have beneficial effects on a lot of 

2942
02:11:20,561 --> 02:11:20,561
different factors.

2943
02:11:20,561 --> 02:11:25,270
But you know,
you're a guy who's a healthy active guy 

2944
02:11:25,270 --> 02:11:27,350
who's constantly eating correctly and 
not allow yourself,

2945
02:11:27,370 --> 02:11:30,740
streamlines strict with the Diet.
How do you do that on the road?

2946
02:11:30,800 --> 02:11:33,440
Like when you,
when you're in in these different places

2947
02:11:33,441 --> 02:11:38,441
and like say if you're traveling to 
countries and you might not even speak 

2948
02:11:38,441 --> 02:11:41,171
the language,
how do you make sure that you get the 

2949
02:11:41,171 --> 02:11:41,171
right food?
Well,

2950
02:11:41,171 --> 02:11:42,290
I try to always keep the quality is best
I can,

2951
02:11:42,590 --> 02:11:45,080
but as you know,
being a frequent traveler yourself,

2952
02:11:45,081 --> 02:11:50,081
you know,
you can't always get the best quality 

2953
02:11:50,081 --> 02:11:52,631
stuff talking about placebo effect.
I won't let it get me bombed out.

2954
02:11:53,130 --> 02:11:55,130
I want to start thinking negative 
thoughts,

2955
02:11:55,500 --> 02:11:57,080
eh.
Let's say for example,

2956
02:11:57,081 --> 02:11:59,810
I have to eat a,
Oh,

2957
02:11:59,811 --> 02:12:02,000
I don't know,
a bag of pretzels or something.

2958
02:12:02,450 --> 02:12:07,450
I believe I can sublimate any ill effect
of that food and that just just by being

2959
02:12:07,701 --> 02:12:10,400
grateful,
just by visualizing my body,

2960
02:12:10,430 --> 02:12:13,310
being able to respond well to the food,
it's just calories,

2961
02:12:13,311 --> 02:12:18,311
you know,
I see myself digesting it and 

2962
02:12:18,311 --> 02:12:20,150
assimilating it and I won't let it 
negatively negatively affect me.

2963
02:12:20,520 --> 02:12:22,890
You just look at it as raw cowers 
characters,

2964
02:12:23,010 --> 02:12:24,380
you know,
so it's some starch.

2965
02:12:24,381 --> 02:12:29,381
It's not the best stuff in the world and
it's not like I'm going to be eating 

2966
02:12:29,381 --> 02:12:32,321
that as a habit and I,
I'll be fine because you can work 

2967
02:12:32,321 --> 02:12:32,530
yourself up into like a,
a,

2968
02:12:32,600 --> 02:12:35,150
you know,
a real negative thing.

2969
02:12:35,390 --> 02:12:37,370
I'm going to give you an example.
When I was younger,

2970
02:12:37,520 --> 02:12:38,890
I had a friend that was,
uh,

2971
02:12:39,350 --> 02:12:44,350
uh,
taught me a lot about higher mind 

2972
02:12:44,350 --> 02:12:46,541
science and uh,
we were in a restaurant one time 

2973
02:12:46,541 --> 02:12:48,761
together and this is,
I guess maybe in the late seventies and 

2974
02:12:48,761 --> 02:12:49,250
there's a guy smoking this is when 
people could still smoke.

2975
02:12:49,910 --> 02:12:54,910
And uh,
those guys bought in to smoke on me and 

2976
02:12:54,910 --> 02:12:54,910
I'm getting madder by the minute is 
really pissing me off.

2977
02:12:54,910 --> 02:12:56,350
So I asked the guy if he,
if it's,

2978
02:12:56,430 --> 02:13:01,430
you know,
if he would please not blow smoke over 

2979
02:13:01,430 --> 02:13:01,430
to me.

2980
02:13:01,430 --> 02:13:04,690
And the guys started doing it even more 
and I wanted to punch the guy right in 

2981
02:13:04,690 --> 02:13:04,890
the face.
And uh,

2982
02:13:04,891 --> 02:13:09,590
I'm looking at my friend Tim,
and he's totally relaxed.

2983
02:13:09,591 --> 02:13:10,640
You know,
about the whole thing.

2984
02:13:11,080 --> 02:13:12,440
And it says,
doesn't that bother you?

2985
02:13:12,470 --> 02:13:14,690
Doesn't that really aggravate you?
And he said,

2986
02:13:14,691 --> 02:13:16,730
Steve,
you get yourself all worked up because I

2987
02:13:16,731 --> 02:13:19,220
can sublimate the bad effects of the 
smoke,

2988
02:13:19,400 --> 02:13:21,650
but not letting it get to me.
He says,

2989
02:13:21,830 --> 02:13:26,830
all those negative emotions and the 
anger and upset your feeling are 10 

2990
02:13:26,830 --> 02:13:28,850
times worse than any amount of cigarette
smoke blowing on you.

2991
02:13:29,600 --> 02:13:34,600
He says,
you're actually doing harm by the way 

2992
02:13:34,600 --> 02:13:37,191
you're thinking about it as opposed to 
the actual harms the smokes doing and 

2993
02:13:37,191 --> 02:13:40,941
wow,
that blew me away and I've seen him so 

2994
02:13:40,941 --> 02:13:41,040
relaxed and I started thinking,
well,

2995
02:13:41,190 --> 02:13:46,190
that's probably everything in life.
So I started looking at food the same 

2996
02:13:46,190 --> 02:13:46,190
way.

2997
02:13:46,190 --> 02:13:47,280
You know,
if you're,

2998
02:13:47,281 --> 02:13:49,020
if you eat something that may be you 
know,

2999
02:13:49,021 --> 02:13:52,740
isn't the best quality because there's 
just no other thing available.

3000
02:13:53,220 --> 02:13:54,000
Well,
so what?

3001
02:13:54,360 --> 02:13:55,680
You'll be fine,
you know,

3002
02:13:55,740 --> 02:14:00,420
you just go back to eating a really,
really good quality stuff after that.

3003
02:14:00,780 --> 02:14:04,140
It's what you do most of the time is,
is the kid.

3004
02:14:04,620 --> 02:14:08,160
Not What happens upon occasion,
but I will say this as a,

3005
02:14:08,250 --> 02:14:13,250
as a full time traveler,
I will pack my own food as much as I 

3006
02:14:13,250 --> 02:14:16,671
can.
I always carry it like a little grocery 

3007
02:14:16,671 --> 02:14:16,671
bag.
Yeah.

3008
02:14:16,671 --> 02:14:19,341
I was just telling your instagram and 
your girlfriend got food confiscated and

3009
02:14:20,790 --> 02:14:25,790
what did they confiscate?
A lot of times you can't take anything 

3010
02:14:25,790 --> 02:14:27,570
that looks at little liquidity through 
the security.

3011
02:14:27,870 --> 02:14:29,970
Sometimes they'll grab fruit,
you know,

3012
02:14:29,971 --> 02:14:31,830
like going from Mali,
back to the mainland,

3013
02:14:32,070 --> 02:14:35,330
all the fruit and stuff.
Any fresh produce they will.

3014
02:14:35,380 --> 02:14:37,980
They'll take a for example,
I had a salad,

3015
02:14:37,981 --> 02:14:39,070
right?
Uh,

3016
02:14:39,071 --> 02:14:41,790
the lenders was fine,
but they wanted the tomatoes,

3017
02:14:41,940 --> 02:14:45,690
the cucumbers off that would impasse.
Yeah.

3018
02:14:45,691 --> 02:14:48,720
The Department of Agriculture Guy,
speaking of Buddha,

3019
02:14:48,721 --> 02:14:53,721
right.
It was just the craziest thing they 

3020
02:14:53,721 --> 02:14:53,721
asked the just why I did,
but you know,

3021
02:14:53,721 --> 02:14:58,371
he had no real format.
They never have an explanation for it 

3022
02:14:58,371 --> 02:14:58,430
and stuff.
It's just band or whatever.

3023
02:14:58,431 --> 02:14:59,850
I don't know.
Certain flies.

3024
02:15:01,850 --> 02:15:03,140
Well,
they're attracted to the liquid,

3025
02:15:03,160 --> 02:15:05,940
be attracted to the stuff.
But uh,

3026
02:15:06,060 --> 02:15:11,060
yeah,
usually I don't have too much trouble 

3027
02:15:11,060 --> 02:15:11,060
getting stuff through.
And it's funny,

3028
02:15:11,060 --> 02:15:14,600
some countries are so amazingly lax,
like whereabouts is the Australia?

3029
02:15:15,841 --> 02:15:17,850
He could take liquids through the 
security.

3030
02:15:18,180 --> 02:15:18,870
You can.
Yeah,

3031
02:15:18,871 --> 02:15:20,250
you can take water and all sorts of 
stuff,

3032
02:15:20,251 --> 02:15:23,190
but you can't take a dogged Australia to
see what happened with Johnny.

3033
02:15:23,580 --> 02:15:28,580
Johnny.
Johnny Depp is still in trouble with 

3034
02:15:28,580 --> 02:15:28,580
that.

3035
02:15:28,580 --> 02:15:28,890
Did you see his video that he made?
I haven't seen it.

3036
02:15:28,900 --> 02:15:31,160
It's hilarious.
It must be really fun.

3037
02:15:31,200 --> 02:15:35,550
It's hilarious because he mock serious,
talked through his video,

3038
02:15:35,551 --> 02:15:36,030
like,
you know,

3039
02:15:36,031 --> 02:15:41,031
he's an actor,
so he made it look like he was being 

3040
02:15:41,031 --> 02:15:44,121
serious but did so in a way where it's 
pretty obvious to anyone watching that 

3041
02:15:44,121 --> 02:15:48,820
it wasn't serious.
Like it was so subtle that one of the 

3042
02:15:48,820 --> 02:15:52,400
politicians,
one of the main people in Australia 

3043
02:15:52,400 --> 02:15:52,400
actually had a comment on it,
you know,

3044
02:15:52,400 --> 02:15:56,730
how it's pretty obvious that he wasn't 
taking it seriously and made this video.

3045
02:15:56,820 --> 02:16:00,840
It's really weird what we'll go through 
security and what won't,

3046
02:16:00,980 --> 02:16:02,460
you know,
for example,

3047
02:16:02,700 --> 02:16:06,120
in China,
they were absolutely scrupulous.

3048
02:16:06,121 --> 02:16:08,460
I couldn't believe how good this girl 
wasn't that screen.

3049
02:16:08,670 --> 02:16:13,110
She got all my little secret shit I like
because I do all carry on now.

3050
02:16:13,111 --> 02:16:14,190
I don't check bags anymore.

3051
02:16:14,640 --> 02:16:19,640
Uh,
I had a little key that's actually a 

3052
02:16:19,640 --> 02:16:20,070
knife.
It opened up into a little night because

3053
02:16:20,071 --> 02:16:21,180
you didn't need a blade,
you know,

3054
02:16:21,190 --> 02:16:22,080
have to,
you know,

3055
02:16:22,530 --> 02:16:26,550
you always could use a blade no matter 
where you are to cut stuff or whatever.

3056
02:16:27,140 --> 02:16:30,160
You just always have a need for it.
She found that kid,

3057
02:16:30,220 --> 02:16:32,440
I don't even know how the hell she knew 
that that was a knife.

3058
02:16:32,970 --> 02:16:33,630
They,
um,

3059
02:16:34,090 --> 02:16:36,040
I carry like little survival tools with 
me.

3060
02:16:36,041 --> 02:16:41,041
I have like a little flint still 
firestarter sometimes when you start 

3061
02:16:41,041 --> 02:16:44,761
firing a fucking Zombie apocalypse ever 
come up.

3062
02:16:44,860 --> 02:16:47,370
Does your astrologer telling you that 
you need to carry that around that.

3063
02:16:47,400 --> 02:16:51,100
But I watched the walking dead fear,
the walking dead,

3064
02:16:52,060 --> 02:16:53,220
speaking of,
you know,

3065
02:16:53,320 --> 02:16:58,120
creating a mental but also have like one
of those little drinking straws.

3066
02:16:58,480 --> 02:17:00,280
But you know,
I'm in a filter.

3067
02:17:01,090 --> 02:17:03,360
You can actually drink a ton 40.

3068
02:17:03,390 --> 02:17:04,180
Yeah.
Well,

3069
02:17:04,181 --> 02:17:05,150
you know,
when I saw that,

3070
02:17:05,670 --> 02:17:07,750
remember the tsunami hit badly,
that resort,

3071
02:17:07,770 --> 02:17:12,770
you know,
I'm in places like that and I just 

3072
02:17:12,770 --> 02:17:12,770
figured better safe than.
Sorry.

3073
02:17:12,770 --> 02:17:14,380
Yeah,
I do believe that,

3074
02:17:14,980 --> 02:17:15,660
you know,
there's,

3075
02:17:15,940 --> 02:17:18,220
my astrologer will keep me safe from 
these things,

3076
02:17:19,360 --> 02:17:24,360
but let's just say we would have a 
situation where the water would be 

3077
02:17:24,360 --> 02:17:27,541
really shitty.
Like I've been in like places like a 

3078
02:17:27,541 --> 02:17:28,420
Novosibirsk in Russia.
Dude,

3079
02:17:28,450 --> 02:17:31,450
that's like in the middle of absolute 
nowhere.

3080
02:17:31,780 --> 02:17:36,780
You know,
if there would be any kind of natural 

3081
02:17:36,780 --> 02:17:36,780
disaster or something,
at least I know I can drink.

3082
02:17:36,780 --> 02:17:36,900
Right,
right.

3083
02:17:37,270 --> 02:17:42,270
And you know,
I have like a little thing I could make 

3084
02:17:42,270 --> 02:17:42,270
flour.
I mean you never playing,

3085
02:17:42,270 --> 02:17:43,510
playing,
playing go down and I'm surviving in the

3086
02:17:43,511 --> 02:17:48,511
Andes or something.
Have you ever made a fire with one of 

3087
02:17:48,511 --> 02:17:48,511
those things?
Yeah,

3088
02:17:48,511 --> 02:17:48,511
I have actually really packed.
Yeah.

3089
02:17:48,511 --> 02:17:50,110
I just wanted to see if I could do bring
kindling with you as well.

3090
02:17:50,110 --> 02:17:50,680
You.
Yeah,

3091
02:17:50,681 --> 02:17:51,450
you get,
you know,

3092
02:17:51,451 --> 02:17:54,850
it was like a whole little art to doing 
a fire from.

3093
02:17:55,270 --> 02:17:59,920
It's fun to try those.
They call them earth skills are ancient.

3094
02:18:00,010 --> 02:18:05,010
Ancient skills with a lot of people 
bring like steel wool or something like 

3095
02:18:05,010 --> 02:18:05,010
that.
We'll go with batteries.

3096
02:18:05,010 --> 02:18:09,991
Works really good.
And I also have a little magnifying 

3097
02:18:09,991 --> 02:18:09,991
glass thing.
I travel.

3098
02:18:09,991 --> 02:18:10,210
I always have a compass,
you know,

3099
02:18:10,240 --> 02:18:11,260
bring a company.
Well,

3100
02:18:11,261 --> 02:18:16,261
you know,
as old school I've learned how to use a 

3101
02:18:16,261 --> 02:18:16,261
map and accomplishment as a kid.
As a boy scout.

3102
02:18:16,261 --> 02:18:18,600
You do orienteering.
So I knew how to do the uh,

3103
02:18:18,610 --> 02:18:19,400
the knots,
you know,

3104
02:18:19,401 --> 02:18:22,690
my little thing.
So when you're going to these places,

3105
02:18:22,691 --> 02:18:25,960
like say if you get an offer to go to 
some strange place in Siberia,

3106
02:18:26,170 --> 02:18:30,820
are you reluctant to take any of these 
or the just like anybody who wants to do

3107
02:18:30,821 --> 02:18:31,390
a seminar?

3108
02:18:31,450 --> 02:18:33,670
I'm open for the journey,
much open for the journey.

3109
02:18:33,671 --> 02:18:35,090
I like to go to different places,
you know.

3110
02:18:35,500 --> 02:18:37,170
But in China there's last time,
my God,

3111
02:18:37,171 --> 02:18:38,950
they were taking my to fricken nail 
clippers,

3112
02:18:39,550 --> 02:18:41,410
nail clippers.
They found that little key.

3113
02:18:41,590 --> 02:18:44,890
They took my little fire starter.
How she even knew what that shit was.

3114
02:18:45,030 --> 02:18:50,030
I have no clue.
They must be well trained because she 

3115
02:18:50,030 --> 02:18:51,370
nailed me for everything man.
Wow.

3116
02:18:51,371 --> 02:18:53,140
And then you get in trouble when the 
nail you for that.

3117
02:18:53,860 --> 02:18:56,890
They just take it because none of it 
could be considered a weapon.

3118
02:18:57,310 --> 02:18:59,650
However,
I was arrested in Switzerland one time.

3119
02:19:00,220 --> 02:19:03,460
I had been traveling by train.
I had one of those.

3120
02:19:03,810 --> 02:19:08,320
A Gerber or was it cold still?
It was like a knife.

3121
02:19:08,340 --> 02:19:12,020
The spring assisted rock climbers use it
because you know,

3122
02:19:12,040 --> 02:19:14,950
if you're rock climbing and you're 
harnessed gets tangled,

3123
02:19:15,250 --> 02:19:16,840
you may have to.

3124
02:19:17,020 --> 02:19:19,890
You have to hold on to cut yourself free
from your harness,

3125
02:19:19,900 --> 02:19:21,220
right.
So you need a knife,

3126
02:19:21,221 --> 02:19:24,460
you can easily open up with one hand.
So I just liked it.

3127
02:19:24,461 --> 02:19:29,461
It was a great little knife and uh,
I had been by train and had it in my 

3128
02:19:29,481 --> 02:19:34,481
little,
my little man purse carry on thing and 

3129
02:19:34,481 --> 02:19:37,541
forgot about the damn thing.
So it went through and they pull me 

3130
02:19:38,061 --> 02:19:39,810
aside and they,
they,

3131
02:19:39,811 --> 02:19:41,600
they pulled that knife out of there and 
I was like,

3132
02:19:41,630 --> 02:19:44,360
Oh shit.
And they said in Switzerland,

3133
02:19:44,390 --> 02:19:47,570
a assistant opening night is considered 
a weapon.

3134
02:19:48,740 --> 02:19:51,680
And the place took me back.
I sat there,

3135
02:19:51,681 --> 02:19:53,430
I almost missed my plane.
They,

3136
02:19:53,440 --> 02:19:54,020
you know,
they,

3137
02:19:54,070 --> 02:19:59,070
they obviously were going on Interpol 
and doing all this bullshit to find out 

3138
02:19:59,360 --> 02:20:01,610
who I was and what I'm doing with this 
knife.

3139
02:20:01,940 --> 02:20:06,940
While to add insult to injury,
I also had like a little credit card 

3140
02:20:06,940 --> 02:20:09,380
thing and it also had like a little 
teeny blade in it.

3141
02:20:09,740 --> 02:20:10,970
It was like one of those,
uh,

3142
02:20:11,380 --> 02:20:13,400
multi-tool in the shape of a credit 
card.

3143
02:20:13,610 --> 02:20:16,370
So they found two blades in my freaking 
carry on.

3144
02:20:16,580 --> 02:20:21,580
I could have got away with a credit card
because they wouldn't have even looked 

3145
02:20:21,580 --> 02:20:24,491
at that,
but once they found one thing that tore 

3146
02:20:24,491 --> 02:20:24,491
my shit apartment,
they looked at everything.

3147
02:20:24,491 --> 02:20:26,330
Oh my God.
But it's weird,

3148
02:20:26,331 --> 02:20:27,550
you know,
like Australia,

3149
02:20:27,560 --> 02:20:32,560
China,
you don't even have to take off your 

3150
02:20:32,560 --> 02:20:32,560
shoes most places you don't have to grow
up shoes,

3151
02:20:32,560 --> 02:20:35,960
but us,
you still do fingernail clippers.

3152
02:20:35,961 --> 02:20:38,900
All that stuff goes through even small.
Even small knives,

3153
02:20:38,920 --> 02:20:43,920
you know,
they don't even bat an eyelash 

3154
02:20:43,920 --> 02:20:45,551
multi-tool we can take through Tsa,
but they're looking for stuff like 

3155
02:20:45,551 --> 02:20:45,680
liquid and,
you know,

3156
02:20:45,860 --> 02:20:48,080
any kind of shoes,
electronics.

3157
02:20:48,081 --> 02:20:50,000
A lot of times I saw them this past 
time.

3158
02:20:50,500 --> 02:20:52,000
I'm making them,
um,

3159
02:20:52,100 --> 02:20:57,100
making people prove that their computers
could turn on a saw a number of that 

3160
02:20:57,100 --> 02:21:01,350
because you know,
that one dude tried to slip a bomb 

3161
02:21:01,350 --> 02:21:01,350
through the laptop.

3162
02:21:01,350 --> 02:21:04,120
And recently have you traveled lately?
Uh,

3163
02:21:04,220 --> 02:21:09,220
did you find the security lines were 
like crazy internationally mean or just 

3164
02:21:09,220 --> 02:21:10,220
even within the US?
Seems normal.

3165
02:21:10,530 --> 02:21:15,200
It's always value is ridiculous.
At lax was absolutely awful.

3166
02:21:15,600 --> 02:21:16,070
Uh,
that,

3167
02:21:16,100 --> 02:21:21,100
that lady got through security and 
actually boarded a plane with no 

3168
02:21:21,100 --> 02:21:23,460
credentials are boarding pass one.
There's just,

3169
02:21:23,690 --> 02:21:26,660
it was just,
I read like a Bang News.

3170
02:21:26,720 --> 02:21:31,720
I usually read the,
I don't like to read the actual news 

3171
02:21:31,720 --> 02:21:31,850
because it's always talk about negative 
mindset.

3172
02:21:32,030 --> 02:21:34,280
I just look at the headlines just to 
see,

3173
02:21:34,281 --> 02:21:39,281
like,
just give me a clue like what's going 

3174
02:21:39,281 --> 02:21:39,281
on,
which I be scared of.

3175
02:21:39,281 --> 02:21:39,281
What new virus.
Well,

3176
02:21:39,281 --> 02:21:40,400
yeah,
I never read that shit,

3177
02:21:40,401 --> 02:21:44,120
but I do like to read travel stuff just 
to see what the latest and greatest is,

3178
02:21:44,121 --> 02:21:45,570
you know.
And uh,

3179
02:21:45,650 --> 02:21:46,850
anyway,
there was a new,

3180
02:21:46,900 --> 02:21:48,740
it hit international news.
Well,

3181
02:21:48,741 --> 02:21:49,430
yeah,
there we go.

3182
02:21:50,270 --> 02:21:55,270
She actually went,
got the whole way through and the word 

3183
02:21:55,270 --> 02:21:58,781
came down because TSA was already under 
fire basically just for being 

3184
02:21:58,781 --> 02:21:59,750
incompetent.
So,

3185
02:21:59,751 --> 02:22:00,730
uh,
the.

3186
02:22:01,060 --> 02:22:06,060
Anyway,
this woman got through and now all of a 

3187
02:22:06,060 --> 02:22:06,060
sudden now this will be going on for the
next month or two.

3188
02:22:06,060 --> 02:22:07,880
They're just,
Oh my God,

3189
02:22:07,970 --> 02:22:09,470
it's,
the travel is so delayed.

3190
02:22:09,560 --> 02:22:11,360
That's interesting because I've been 
traveling a lot.

3191
02:22:11,361 --> 02:22:13,430
It seems totally normal.
It always sucks.

3192
02:22:13,490 --> 02:22:15,410
Well,
I usually go pre,

3193
02:22:16,270 --> 02:22:21,270
uh,
this last time I took the budget spirit 

3194
02:22:21,270 --> 02:22:23,180
airlines,
they don't have any contract with TSA so

3195
02:22:23,181 --> 02:22:25,890
everybody goes through like the long ass

3196
02:22:26,070 --> 02:22:28,830
security lines,
but one of the best things I ever did,

3197
02:22:28,831 --> 02:22:33,831
I did global entry and I can just walk 
through like a freaking Rockstar when I 

3198
02:22:33,831 --> 02:22:35,780
come into jetpack.
Global entries.

3199
02:22:35,790 --> 02:22:36,570
Nice.
Oh my God.

3200
02:22:36,571 --> 02:22:37,980
It's so nice.
But along with it,

3201
02:22:37,981 --> 02:22:41,430
you get the pray and I usually fly 
business or first class these days,

3202
02:22:41,431 --> 02:22:44,970
especially for the really long flights.
Man that Prius so nice.

3203
02:22:45,330 --> 02:22:50,330
No shoes off.
I'm going to have to take off your 

3204
02:22:50,330 --> 02:22:50,810
jacket a.
yeah,

3205
02:22:50,880 --> 02:22:52,950
it's interesting.
It's changed,

3206
02:22:53,260 --> 02:22:56,220
you know,
short how that's changed over the course

3207
02:22:56,221 --> 02:22:56,990
of our lives,
you know,

3208
02:22:57,010 --> 02:22:59,340
it used to be you don't even have to 
have an id to get a plane,

3209
02:22:59,660 --> 02:23:03,060
get used to just hand them the ticket 
and you could give a ticket to a friend.

3210
02:23:03,410 --> 02:23:05,160
That friend could go on the plane 
instead of you.

3211
02:23:05,260 --> 02:23:05,940
Yeah,
that's right.

3212
02:23:06,150 --> 02:23:07,050
That was the old days.

3213
02:23:07,190 --> 02:23:07,920
The old days,
man.

3214
02:23:07,921 --> 02:23:09,810
You could just drive through Canada.
No problem.

3215
02:23:09,811 --> 02:23:10,620
You know,
come back.

3216
02:23:10,621 --> 02:23:12,390
I mean,
it was none of that kind of stuff.

3217
02:23:12,660 --> 02:23:15,030
So this astrologer told you to move to 
Maui,

3218
02:23:15,340 --> 02:23:16,920
you gonna,
you gonna follow his advice.

3219
02:23:16,921 --> 02:23:18,380
You're going to go there and I'm gonna.
Uh,

3220
02:23:18,390 --> 02:23:22,140
I'm setting up a little home base to 
work out.

3221
02:23:22,170 --> 02:23:25,320
I'll start travel somewhat due to some 
seminars,

3222
02:23:25,321 --> 02:23:30,321
but I'm going to set up a shop and yeah,
because I was thinking for a guy like 

3223
02:23:30,321 --> 02:23:31,980
you,
a lot of people would come to you,

3224
02:23:32,340 --> 02:23:36,630
like it might not be a bad idea to just 
family van Damn Nice place to attract,

3225
02:23:36,631 --> 02:23:37,210
right?
Yeah.

3226
02:23:37,260 --> 02:23:42,260
And not only that,
but you could set up seminars on a 

3227
02:23:42,260 --> 02:23:44,190
weekly basis and do them literally from 
the comfort of your own home.

3228
02:23:44,220 --> 02:23:49,220
You could just have a program where you 
run people out of Malibu and make a 

3229
02:23:49,220 --> 02:23:54,150
great living or Maui rather and uh,
and go back and forth if you so choose.

3230
02:23:54,150 --> 02:23:59,150
You could kind of go anywhere.
If you did do that and you could 

3231
02:23:59,150 --> 02:24:00,420
establish your own gymnasium and like 
have like a real gym there.

3232
02:24:01,470 --> 02:24:03,300
Would you start changing your own 
training?

3233
02:24:03,301 --> 02:24:05,990
Because I know a lot of what you're 
doing now is mostly by way back,

3234
02:24:06,340 --> 02:24:08,370
get back to some of the things that I 
really,

3235
02:24:08,371 --> 02:24:09,340
really enjoy,
you know,

3236
02:24:09,520 --> 02:24:12,560
like what I liked the clubs that I club 
swinging.

3237
02:24:12,860 --> 02:24:15,030
I like swinging the light clubs,
you know,

3238
02:24:15,031 --> 02:24:20,031
just as a mobility thing.
It makes my elbows and shoulders and 

3239
02:24:20,031 --> 02:24:20,031
wrist feel good.
You know what I'm talking about?

3240
02:24:20,031 --> 02:24:22,440
The little one pound Indian clubs I used
to.

3241
02:24:23,230 --> 02:24:24,770
I used to be quite the expert.
You know,

3242
02:24:24,800 --> 02:24:29,800
I actually learned that as a physical 
education major in college real as a 

3243
02:24:29,800 --> 02:24:30,060
freshman.
Uh,

3244
02:24:30,070 --> 02:24:34,440
as all pe majors had to learn basic old 
school physical culture systems.

3245
02:24:34,650 --> 02:24:37,840
And one of those was the old wooden club
system back in the day,

3246
02:24:37,841 --> 02:24:38,040
Huh?

3247
02:24:38,160 --> 02:24:43,160
Yeah.
That was a 1970 when I went through the 

3248
02:24:43,160 --> 02:24:43,980
school of Health and physical education 
at Westchester.

3249
02:24:44,010 --> 02:24:46,290
That's interesting that now 40 plus 
years later,

3250
02:24:46,291 --> 02:24:48,430
those sorts of training modalities are 
coming back.

3251
02:24:48,560 --> 02:24:49,320
Yeah.
Well,

3252
02:24:49,800 --> 02:24:50,790
so old is new,
right?

3253
02:24:50,850 --> 02:24:55,850
Yeah.
That's the little kettle bells is a 

3254
02:24:55,850 --> 02:24:55,850
perfect example of that,
right?

3255
02:24:55,850 --> 02:24:55,850
Page example,
they,

3256
02:24:55,850 --> 02:24:57,090
you know,
that was old school training tool.

3257
02:24:57,450 --> 02:24:58,860
Uh,
then they came from Germany,

3258
02:24:58,861 --> 02:24:59,480
by the way,
not,

3259
02:24:59,560 --> 02:25:03,060
not Russia really at the Germans were 
the ones that actually established.

3260
02:25:03,240 --> 02:25:05,460
He called him ringlets in those days.
No kidding.

3261
02:25:05,461 --> 02:25:10,461
A lot of the old German strong men use 
them and it looked the same like a 

3262
02:25:10,461 --> 02:25:11,430
cannon ball with the handle,
a condo.

3263
02:25:11,500 --> 02:25:13,920
So there was a lot of really weird 
designs.

3264
02:25:13,921 --> 02:25:17,370
Some of them really like circle just on 
a cannon ball,

3265
02:25:17,371 --> 02:25:20,380
you know,
they used to use real heavy ones in,

3266
02:25:20,381 --> 02:25:25,381
there are,
a lot of them were hollow and he would 

3267
02:25:25,381 --> 02:25:25,381
unscrew it

3268
02:25:25,381 --> 02:25:27,250
and they would put weight inside and 
screw it back on.

3269
02:25:27,640 --> 02:25:28,620
That was kind of interesting.
Oh,

3270
02:25:28,621 --> 02:25:29,620
so you can adjust it.
Yeah,

3271
02:25:29,621 --> 02:25:34,420
like adjustable weights and so forth.
If you had your own gym and you could do

3272
02:25:34,421 --> 02:25:36,770
whatever you want and lift weights and 
you know,

3273
02:25:36,970 --> 02:25:38,980
what would you like,
how would you set it up?

3274
02:25:38,981 --> 02:25:40,300
What'd you do?
Like standard,

3275
02:25:40,480 --> 02:25:43,630
like Olympic style weight lifting type 
exercises,

3276
02:25:43,631 --> 02:25:45,790
or never been a real fan of Olympic 
weightlifting.

3277
02:25:45,850 --> 02:25:50,850
I don't believe that it's the most 
efficient way to train athletes and 

3278
02:25:50,850 --> 02:25:53,920
there's not a lot of Ncaa a strength 
coaches and uh,

3279
02:25:54,300 --> 02:25:55,410
uh,
uh,

3280
02:25:55,420 --> 02:25:58,720
nfl strength coaches is shy more and 
more away from the Olympic lifts.

3281
02:25:58,721 --> 02:26:03,721
They're fine.
They're athletes just getting to busted 

3282
02:26:03,721 --> 02:26:03,721
up and hurt,
you know,

3283
02:26:03,721 --> 02:26:03,880
even just doing a front squat.
Why?

3284
02:26:03,881 --> 02:26:06,560
By our risk of million dollar athlete,
you know,

3285
02:26:06,580 --> 02:26:11,020
to teach them the Olympic lifting is a 
hell of a sport.

3286
02:26:11,020 --> 02:26:13,340
I mean,
it takes a lot of coordination to Joe,

3287
02:26:13,341 --> 02:26:14,390
my big lips.
Yes.

3288
02:26:14,590 --> 02:26:19,590
And as you well know,
one sport doesn't make you better at 

3289
02:26:19,590 --> 02:26:19,810
another sport.
It really doesn't.

3290
02:26:20,010 --> 02:26:25,010
It just causes motor learning confusion.
There's no doubt that Olympic weight 

3291
02:26:25,010 --> 02:26:26,860
lifters are incredible specimens.
They're strong,

3292
02:26:27,010 --> 02:26:28,720
they're fast,
they're explosive,

3293
02:26:29,020 --> 02:26:34,020
but it doesn't follow.
The doing Olympic lifting will make you 

3294
02:26:34,020 --> 02:26:35,740
stronger and more explosive and fast.
It's like self selective.

3295
02:26:36,040 --> 02:26:41,040
The gods had already had those 
attributes to weld Olympic 

3296
02:26:41,040 --> 02:26:42,220
weightlifting.
So if I take a slow twitch wandering,

3297
02:26:42,250 --> 02:26:44,100
give them Olympic lifting,
I can't select.

3298
02:26:44,120 --> 02:26:48,040
We recruit those fast twitch muscle 
papers and make them at fast twitch guy.

3299
02:26:48,660 --> 02:26:53,660
A pride is going to get them hurt.
If I was a wrestling coach or an mma 

3300
02:26:53,660 --> 02:26:58,171
coach or a football coach,
I want to be spending most of my 

3301
02:26:58,171 --> 02:26:59,800
athletes time out practicing the skills 
that the sport,

3302
02:27:00,100 --> 02:27:05,100
that's the most important thing,
the skill of the sport and most of your 

3303
02:27:05,100 --> 02:27:07,660
sports specific conditioning come from 
the practice of the sport itself.

3304
02:27:08,470 --> 02:27:13,470
Aside from that,
I went to general strength training 

3305
02:27:13,470 --> 02:27:14,470
program to make his skeletal muscle is 
as strong as humanly possible.

3306
02:27:15,610 --> 02:27:20,520
So I'm going to use modalities to do 
that and the idea is to keep it is,

3307
02:27:21,280 --> 02:27:26,280
is as safe as possible.
And I see Olympic lifting is pretty on 

3308
02:27:26,980 --> 02:27:29,260
dangerous.
I've seen a lotta guys busted themselves

3309
02:27:29,261 --> 02:27:30,370
up hurting themselves,
you know,

3310
02:27:30,640 --> 02:27:32,200
we're trying to do it.
So I'm not a big fan.

3311
02:27:32,770 --> 02:27:36,610
So you're seeing motor learning 
confusion is the term?

3312
02:27:36,611 --> 02:27:39,340
Yeah,
like sometimes people think that a power

3313
02:27:39,341 --> 02:27:41,530
clean is like the snap,
uh,

3314
02:27:41,560 --> 02:27:43,870
finish off a AA pickup,
thrown something,

3315
02:27:44,020 --> 02:27:45,950
but it's a completely different skill 
set.

3316
02:27:46,620 --> 02:27:48,490
One isn't going to make you better at 
doing the other.

3317
02:27:49,360 --> 02:27:54,360
Do you think though that strengthening 
your muscles and having more explosion 

3318
02:27:54,360 --> 02:27:59,191
and more the ability to close the 
distance quicker from box jumps and 

3319
02:27:59,191 --> 02:28:03,241
sprints and things along those lines can
directly translate to things like 

3320
02:28:03,241 --> 02:28:04,660
martial arts,
like I don't think it's very specific.

3321
02:28:04,660 --> 02:28:09,660
Yeah.
Doing a box jump as a whole lot 

3322
02:28:09,660 --> 02:28:09,660
different than shit into double egg 
throw.

3323
02:28:09,660 --> 02:28:09,660
Right?
Ever.

3324
02:28:09,660 --> 02:28:12,610
The best way to get guys really 
explosive of doing that is just do those

3325
02:28:12,611 --> 02:28:15,580
things over and over and over again and 
get really good at it.

3326
02:28:15,880 --> 02:28:17,320
That's very controversial,
isn't it?

3327
02:28:17,380 --> 02:28:18,400
Oh yeah.
There's A.

3328
02:28:18,401 --> 02:28:21,530
There's as many guys that a talk like 
me.

3329
02:28:21,980 --> 02:28:25,040
There's just as many guys that would 
argue to the death the other way,

3330
02:28:25,640 --> 02:28:26,960
but I've done both.
You know,

3331
02:28:26,961 --> 02:28:31,961
as a young boy,
I learned Olympic weight lifting from 

3332
02:28:31,961 --> 02:28:34,490
the last Olympic world champion,
Robert Bednarski.

3333
02:28:34,790 --> 02:28:39,790
My Dad used to take me down to York,
Pennsylvania when the United States was 

3334
02:28:39,790 --> 02:28:44,081
still the Mecca for Olympic lifting and 
I actually learned Olympic lifting down 

3335
02:28:44,081 --> 02:28:44,510
there,
the Old York Jim.

3336
02:28:44,870 --> 02:28:45,800
Wow.
Yeah,

3337
02:28:45,860 --> 02:28:49,630
and I used to lift in my basement,
but what I've found even when I was just

3338
02:28:49,640 --> 02:28:53,510
in high school as a wrestler that it 
wasn't really helping that much and even

3339
02:28:53,511 --> 02:28:58,511
then I just sensed like a real danger to
my body in wrestling is a tough sport as

3340
02:29:01,041 --> 02:29:02,250
it is,
right?

3341
02:29:02,480 --> 02:29:05,210
What your training should prevent 
injuries.

3342
02:29:05,960 --> 02:29:10,960
If a person needs to foam roll and do 
massages and is hurting themselves in 

3343
02:29:12,231 --> 02:29:14,840
their supplementary training,
there's something wrong.

3344
02:29:15,350 --> 02:29:20,120
If it's really a good training modality,
it should prevent injuries not caused.

3345
02:29:20,390 --> 02:29:25,390
So I,
I'm a firm believer in getting rid of 

3346
02:29:25,390 --> 02:29:25,390
all of the,
uh,

3347
02:29:25,390 --> 02:29:28,870
of the dangerous stuff out of your 
training because uh,

3348
02:29:28,980 --> 02:29:29,870
you know,
what we do,

3349
02:29:29,990 --> 02:29:34,990
you know,
martial artists dangerous enough as it 

3350
02:29:34,990 --> 02:29:34,990
is,
that's really controversial though.

3351
02:29:34,990 --> 02:29:39,880
I mean there's a lot of really high 
level strength and conditioning coaches 

3352
02:29:39,880 --> 02:29:43,061
that think that strength training and 
power training and things along those 

3353
02:29:43,061 --> 02:29:44,690
lines actually improve all of your 
skills,

3354
02:29:44,990 --> 02:29:46,490
your skills.
As a martial artist,

3355
02:29:46,520 --> 02:29:49,250
I've been strength training for 53 
years.

3356
02:29:49,251 --> 02:29:51,290
I didn't find that myself.
Right,

3357
02:29:51,291 --> 02:29:53,180
but based on your own body,
in your own life,

3358
02:29:53,600 --> 02:29:56,630
but also with clients.
Remember I've trained literally hundreds

3359
02:29:56,630 --> 02:30:01,630
and hundreds if not thousands of people 
over the years and I did find a good 

3360
02:30:01,630 --> 02:30:01,630
correlation.

3361
02:30:01,630 --> 02:30:05,150
It's just interesting because in was at 
men's journal,

3362
02:30:05,210 --> 02:30:10,210
there was just an article by a guy who 
is like one of the leading experts in 

3363
02:30:10,700 --> 02:30:15,700
speech reading and he,
he found that the thing that correlates 

3364
02:30:15,700 --> 02:30:20,170
most to your ability to run fast,
like in a sprint a was the trap bar 

3365
02:30:20,850 --> 02:30:23,480
deadlift.
He tried leg presses,

3366
02:30:23,630 --> 02:30:25,730
cleans front squats,
all this stuff.

3367
02:30:25,970 --> 02:30:30,970
The thing that had the greatest transfer
into improving your,

3368
02:30:31,071 --> 02:30:36,071
your,
your ability to sprint was the trap bar 

3369
02:30:36,071 --> 02:30:36,071
deadlift.
Why is that?

3370
02:30:36,071 --> 02:30:40,070
Just the way it positions the hips and 
the way that the weight is centered,

3371
02:30:40,280 --> 02:30:45,280
you know,
like instead of out in front of you 

3372
02:30:45,280 --> 02:30:45,280
where there's auto spinal sheering,
the,

3373
02:30:45,280 --> 02:30:49,330
your hands are on your side.
So it's like you're almost inside the 

3374
02:30:49,330 --> 02:30:49,330
weight.
Yes.

3375
02:30:49,330 --> 02:30:53,900
Uh,
and the way you hinge out in that trap 

3376
02:30:53,900 --> 02:30:53,900
bar deadlift,
I'm a big fan of that.

3377
02:30:54,060 --> 02:30:59,060
The only way I do them now,
they always felt just intuitively like 

3378
02:30:59,060 --> 02:31:00,800
such a damn good exercise.
Well anyway,

3379
02:31:00,910 --> 02:31:02,670
it was just in this month's issue,
uh,

3380
02:31:02,710 --> 02:31:07,710
I think it was men's journal.
My only feeling on trap bar deadlifts is

3381
02:31:07,821 --> 02:31:12,821
I always felt like I didn't get deep 
enough because the 45 pound plates were 

3382
02:31:12,821 --> 02:31:12,821
so large.
Well,

3383
02:31:12,821 --> 02:31:17,380
he was saying that is not necessarily 
get that much range of motion for 

3384
02:31:17,380 --> 02:31:19,560
sprinting because your legs aren't 
really bend that much anyway.

3385
02:31:19,890 --> 02:31:22,800
But there's a lot of strengths in speed 
coaches,

3386
02:31:22,801 --> 02:31:27,801
like really well known guys,
they're now going against power cleans 

3387
02:31:27,801 --> 02:31:31,341
front squats and all that.
Judge a Franco is really a famous 

3388
02:31:31,341 --> 02:31:31,341
strength coach.
He,

3389
02:31:31,390 --> 02:31:34,860
he won't risk the injury to his athletes
anymore of this stuff.

3390
02:31:34,861 --> 02:31:37,770
He's finding guys were messing up their 
elbows or wrists,

3391
02:31:37,771 --> 02:31:39,060
their fingers.
I mean,

3392
02:31:39,200 --> 02:31:42,590
if you have a guy that's like top level,
instead of deb away,

3393
02:31:42,840 --> 02:31:45,300
you know,
a wide receiver or something,

3394
02:31:45,330 --> 02:31:50,330
you do not want to use risky modalities 
and risk hurting this guy because what 

3395
02:31:50,701 --> 02:31:53,910
they do as an athlete is risky enough,
you know,

3396
02:31:53,970 --> 02:31:58,970
out there in the way they run and sprint
and cut and so forth that they kind of 

3397
02:31:58,970 --> 02:31:59,880
collisions that they have.

3398
02:32:00,150 --> 02:32:02,370
You want to make that training is safest
possible.

3399
02:32:02,730 --> 02:32:05,880
You want to make it as general as 
possible so they get,

3400
02:32:06,030 --> 02:32:08,400
as you know,
as much strength transfer.

3401
02:32:08,760 --> 02:32:10,650
It doesn't have to be fancy exercise it,
you know,

3402
02:32:10,770 --> 02:32:12,000
basically squat,
hinge,

3403
02:32:12,270 --> 02:32:12,810
push,
pull,

3404
02:32:12,811 --> 02:32:17,811
horizontal and vertical,
some type of rotation or anti rotation 

3405
02:32:17,811 --> 02:32:18,690
and then work the ancillary muscles of 
the neck,

3406
02:32:18,720 --> 02:32:20,130
the fingers,
the hands,

3407
02:32:20,131 --> 02:32:21,090
the forums,
the grip,

3408
02:32:21,330 --> 02:32:26,330
and obviously the feet.
Calves and ankles are really neglected 

3409
02:32:26,330 --> 02:32:27,330
in a lot of people's training.
Week,

3410
02:32:27,330 --> 02:32:28,590
feet,
weak ankles.

3411
02:32:28,591 --> 02:32:30,600
And we'd have a lot of guys leave that 
out.

3412
02:32:30,750 --> 02:32:32,340
And of course the neck.
Man,

3413
02:32:32,400 --> 02:32:37,400
I,
you know how many guys I know the try 

3414
02:32:37,400 --> 02:32:38,460
their neck is crazy man.
Even your jaw,

3415
02:32:38,910 --> 02:32:41,700
you know,
I can remember watching Mohammed Ali,

3416
02:32:42,120 --> 02:32:42,750
uh,
you know,

3417
02:32:42,751 --> 02:32:43,620
the old videos,
you know,

3418
02:32:43,621 --> 02:32:45,450
they do like these little snippets of 
his training.

3419
02:32:45,630 --> 02:32:50,630
He used to do a lot of [inaudible] and 
he had this really cool thing where he 

3420
02:32:50,630 --> 02:32:51,180
would take like a sling and hook it onto
a,

3421
02:32:51,181 --> 02:32:51,570
uh,
you know,

3422
02:32:51,571 --> 02:32:56,571
like a pull down and then he would open 
his jaw against the resistance that is 

3423
02:32:57,091 --> 02:33:02,091
freaking brilliant to,
to strengthen the muscles of the jaw 

3424
02:33:02,091 --> 02:33:02,091
because,
you know,

3425
02:33:02,091 --> 02:33:02,760
it's well known fact that if your jaw is
stronger,

3426
02:33:03,080 --> 02:33:08,080
uh,
there was a lot less chance of a 

3427
02:33:08,080 --> 02:33:08,080
knockout.

3428
02:33:08,080 --> 02:33:10,910
Yeah.
A lot of who used to chew beef jerky so 

3429
02:33:10,910 --> 02:33:12,270
as to strengthen their jaw.
They used to chew bubblegum all the time

3430
02:33:12,271 --> 02:33:12,690
because,
you know,

3431
02:33:12,691 --> 02:33:14,430
your jaw gets tired when you have bubble
gum.

3432
02:33:14,431 --> 02:33:17,250
I get to the bubblegum gets old.
I can just keep chewing on it.

3433
02:33:17,251 --> 02:33:19,200
And they would do that to keep their 
draw strong.

3434
02:33:19,470 --> 02:33:20,220
You know,
it's funny.

3435
02:33:20,221 --> 02:33:20,820
Uh,
they show,

3436
02:33:20,850 --> 02:33:23,180
you remember when we brought up the,
uh,

3437
02:33:23,460 --> 02:33:26,190
Alexander's ass with the tif lifting 
with that bank.

3438
02:33:26,580 --> 02:33:29,460
I used to actually have a mouthpiece in 
two teeth lifting when as a kid.

3439
02:33:29,580 --> 02:33:30,330
Really?
Yeah.

3440
02:33:30,720 --> 02:33:31,200
It was,
uh,

3441
02:33:31,201 --> 02:33:33,250
it was very popular back in the sixties,
you know,

3442
02:33:33,530 --> 02:33:35,640
teeth lifting for your neck and your 
jaws.

3443
02:33:36,030 --> 02:33:39,040
I used to lift my little sister up.
She used to lay down and I put the,

3444
02:33:39,140 --> 02:33:44,140
a little sling and a feeling on those 
like neck harnesses with the chains 

3445
02:33:45,800 --> 02:33:46,190
attached.

3446
02:33:46,260 --> 02:33:47,100
You like those?
Yeah.

3447
02:33:47,150 --> 02:33:52,150
Yeah.
Entrepreneurial too because my trainer 

3448
02:33:52,150 --> 02:33:52,150
hates him.
Uh,

3449
02:33:52,150 --> 02:33:53,700
you have to be careful and some of them 
are really crappy design,

3450
02:33:53,701 --> 02:33:55,460
man.
They hurt your ears and you know,

3451
02:33:55,480 --> 02:33:58,770
I already have qualifiers.
I don't need to make it any worse,

3452
02:33:59,070 --> 02:34:00,330
but uh,
they can be good.

3453
02:34:00,331 --> 02:34:05,331
I think one of the best things ever 
invented was the old nautilus for wide 

3454
02:34:05,331 --> 02:34:09,211
neck machine.
That was a damn good piece of equipment 

3455
02:34:09,211 --> 02:34:09,211
and later the hammer strength for way 
net.

3456
02:34:09,211 --> 02:34:10,620
See those things.
That's like Kelly Starrett.

3457
02:34:10,650 --> 02:34:12,770
I talked to him about those things,
those neck machines.

3458
02:34:12,790 --> 02:34:14,300
He's like,
those are terrible for you now.

3459
02:34:14,310 --> 02:34:15,150
That's bullshit,
man.

3460
02:34:15,180 --> 02:34:15,910
Really?
Yeah,

3461
02:34:17,280 --> 02:34:18,280
I do.
I know who to believe.

3462
02:34:18,510 --> 02:34:20,140
Yeah.
Well you gotta try it yourself.

3463
02:34:20,170 --> 02:34:23,500
I tell people to experiment,
but you know what works really well that

3464
02:34:23,501 --> 02:34:25,330
I don't think would be too controversial
for anyone.

3465
02:34:26,150 --> 02:34:27,820
Neck isom metrics.
Yeah.

3466
02:34:27,821 --> 02:34:30,170
You showed me those with a belt.
They aren't Tocqueville.

3467
02:34:30,330 --> 02:34:31,370
Fantastic.
You know,

3468
02:34:31,371 --> 02:34:33,070
Hixon used to do a lot of neck 
isometrics.

3469
02:34:33,071 --> 02:34:35,730
He used to use that rubber band.
Well,

3470
02:34:35,800 --> 02:34:38,390
he would walk back and just hold it.
Yeah.

3471
02:34:38,420 --> 02:34:43,420
You know,
it's almost like someone trying to pull 

3472
02:34:43,420 --> 02:34:45,001
you down into a front headlock or a 
front good team and then you go from 

3473
02:34:45,001 --> 02:34:49,861
the,
with it on your forehead and on your 

3474
02:34:49,861 --> 02:34:49,861
side and you to develop tremendous 
stability.

3475
02:34:49,870 --> 02:34:54,870
I don't think you know the other stuff.
I could see where it can be 

3476
02:34:54,870 --> 02:34:56,110
controversial because it all comes back 
to your technique,

3477
02:34:56,111 --> 02:34:57,220
your form.
You know,

3478
02:34:57,221 --> 02:35:00,220
if you're an idiot and you're using a 
lot of momentum and you know you're,

3479
02:35:00,221 --> 02:35:00,820
you're,
you're,

3480
02:35:00,850 --> 02:35:05,850
you're using poor technique.
I could see where he can really mess 

3481
02:35:05,850 --> 02:35:06,790
your neck up,
but isometrics.

3482
02:35:07,180 --> 02:35:08,560
They're pretty safe.
Okay.

3483
02:35:08,560 --> 02:35:11,770
But excluding isometrics,
those neck machines,

3484
02:35:11,771 --> 02:35:14,050
like moving your neck when those next 
machine neck machines,

3485
02:35:14,380 --> 02:35:19,380
where do you think the problems?
I think the problems lie and people 

3486
02:35:19,380 --> 02:35:19,380
using momentum too much,
too much weight,

3487
02:35:19,380 --> 02:35:21,420
too much momentum,
and not using good form.

3488
02:35:21,670 --> 02:35:22,330
I mean,
okay.

3489
02:35:22,331 --> 02:35:27,331
We know that you can get really strong 
and really fit using shitty technique 

3490
02:35:27,331 --> 02:35:29,020
and form.
You see it all over the gym.

3491
02:35:29,021 --> 02:35:32,050
You see huge guys seemed really muscular
dude.

3492
02:35:32,350 --> 02:35:37,350
Just thrown the crap out of the ways.
That doesn't necessarily mean it's the 

3493
02:35:37,350 --> 02:35:40,651
best way to go.
Many of those guys don't stand the test 

3494
02:35:40,651 --> 02:35:40,651
of time.
Remember earlier I was saying,

3495
02:35:40,651 --> 02:35:42,130
you know,
anyone under 60,

3496
02:35:42,660 --> 02:35:45,100
Eh,
if they haven't passed over,

3497
02:35:45,180 --> 02:35:49,000
of course that's pretty convenient for 
me now somehow,

3498
02:35:50,080 --> 02:35:51,490
but no,
seriously,

3499
02:35:51,640 --> 02:35:56,640
if you haven't been to the other side,
there's a lot of stuff that I did in my 

3500
02:35:56,640 --> 02:35:56,640
early days.

3501
02:35:56,640 --> 02:35:58,480
No way that I would advocate that stuff 
now,

3502
02:35:58,481 --> 02:36:00,940
man,
but I was always a firm believer in work

3503
02:36:00,941 --> 02:36:05,941
in the neck and I used neck harnesses 
successfully using really good strict 

3504
02:36:06,030 --> 02:36:07,990
form,
not necessarily heavy weight.

3505
02:36:08,320 --> 02:36:12,520
If you put yourself in by mechanically 
in efficient position,

3506
02:36:12,730 --> 02:36:15,730
you can really work those muscles really
hard with very,

3507
02:36:15,731 --> 02:36:18,040
very safe.
Now when you talk about neck,

3508
02:36:18,580 --> 02:36:23,580
neck harnesses and you lift your neck up
and you can lie on a bench and put a 

3509
02:36:24,311 --> 02:36:26,160
plate on your head and lift your head 
up,

3510
02:36:26,570 --> 02:36:30,030
what about side to side movements or you
can also join the site and you're,

3511
02:36:30,031 --> 02:36:31,030
you're cool with those.
Yeah.

3512
02:36:31,450 --> 02:36:33,910
Another one I remember to.
And,

3513
02:36:33,911 --> 02:36:35,710
and,
and violent context sports.

3514
02:36:35,980 --> 02:36:39,250
Someone's going to put your neck in some
pretty weird businesses whether you want

3515
02:36:39,251 --> 02:36:44,251
them to or not.
So you got to kind of endure yourself 

3516
02:36:44,251 --> 02:36:44,251
to,
you know,

3517
02:36:44,251 --> 02:36:48,020
uh,
the basic positions and what kind of 

3518
02:36:48,020 --> 02:36:48,760
repetitions you talking about when 
you're doing neck exercises.

3519
02:36:48,760 --> 02:36:50,020
Pretty High Reps.
I was like,

3520
02:36:50,080 --> 02:36:51,780
well it depends on the speed of movement
to it.

3521
02:36:52,450 --> 02:36:57,450
I mean like I,
I like a slow high tension speed and 

3522
02:36:57,450 --> 02:36:59,830
movement to really fatigue the muscles.
So it just depends how fast you going.

3523
02:36:59,950 --> 02:37:02,330
Real slow.
Usually I go by Tom under load,

3524
02:37:02,331 --> 02:37:05,200
so somewhere between a minute to 90 
seconds.

3525
02:37:05,201 --> 02:37:07,840
Time under load is good for the entire 
set.

3526
02:37:07,870 --> 02:37:08,560
Yeah,
for the set.

3527
02:37:08,730 --> 02:37:13,730
When your 92nd set.
One of the things I've gotten into over 

3528
02:37:13,730 --> 02:37:17,041
the last year or so is a long negatives 
like exploding on the initial movement,

3529
02:37:18,470 --> 02:37:21,050
the power of the movement,
like say if I do a chin up,

3530
02:37:21,080 --> 02:37:25,160
exploding up and at a very slow,
maybe like four times as long,

3531
02:37:25,190 --> 02:37:27,890
maybe even more than more than that on 
the way down.

3532
02:37:28,110 --> 02:37:29,860
And they do training.
Yeah,

3533
02:37:30,050 --> 02:37:31,370
it can be very,
very good.

3534
02:37:31,670 --> 02:37:36,670
It's been used for awhile.
One of the big proponents of that type 

3535
02:37:36,670 --> 02:37:38,910
of training was the famous Mike Mentzer,
the only guy I ever squash nigger.

3536
02:37:39,060 --> 02:37:42,650
We're talking about bodybuilding now and
as real interesting because Mike used to

3537
02:37:42,651 --> 02:37:44,820
use these very intense brief,
uh,

3538
02:37:44,860 --> 02:37:47,660
exercises the year he'd beat Arnold and 
the,

3539
02:37:47,661 --> 02:37:49,640
uh,
and the Mr Universe show,

3540
02:37:50,110 --> 02:37:52,640
uh,
Mike was only trained about 90 minutes a

3541
02:37:52,641 --> 02:37:57,170
week and Arnold was trading about 26 
hours a week.

3542
02:37:57,440 --> 02:38:00,050
How's that possible?
Because of the high intensity training.

3543
02:38:00,080 --> 02:38:01,550
Ninety minutes of non.
Yeah.

3544
02:38:01,551 --> 02:38:03,890
He was very much into a high intensity 
training,

3545
02:38:03,891 --> 02:38:06,920
like 30 minute workouts.
His discipled Dorian Yates.

3546
02:38:06,921 --> 02:38:08,780
That's 3:30
minute workouts a week.

3547
02:38:08,810 --> 02:38:10,160
That's right.
Go check him out.

3548
02:38:10,190 --> 02:38:12,140
He has a whole website called heavy 
duty.

3549
02:38:12,490 --> 02:38:17,490
Uh,
he was a real pioneer in the high 

3550
02:38:17,490 --> 02:38:17,490
tension.
Uh,

3551
02:38:17,490 --> 02:38:21,910
he used a lot and negatives for the,
doing experimentation with isometrics 

3552
02:38:22,160 --> 02:38:23,170
towards the end.
That's,

3553
02:38:23,360 --> 02:38:25,970
that's crazy though,
that he could do this 90 minutes a week.

3554
02:38:26,060 --> 02:38:27,580
And of course they're all using the 
steroids,

3555
02:38:27,581 --> 02:38:28,210
you know,
obviously,

3556
02:38:28,230 --> 02:38:29,340
you know,
with the,

3557
02:38:29,400 --> 02:38:30,680
you know,
that's helps.

3558
02:38:30,710 --> 02:38:32,090
Yeah,
that's what that would give him,

3559
02:38:32,091 --> 02:38:37,091
but people can't say it was just the 
steroids because arnold was using 

3560
02:38:37,091 --> 02:38:37,091
steroids to,
um,

3561
02:38:37,091 --> 02:38:39,290
we were talking about Paavo before the 
podcast,

3562
02:38:39,330 --> 02:38:42,780
Pavel Tsatsouline,
um,

3563
02:38:42,890 --> 02:38:47,890
and he is a proponent of low reps of 
doing things like under five reps,

3564
02:38:50,060 --> 02:38:51,830
five reps are under.
Well,

3565
02:38:51,831 --> 02:38:56,480
remember his sport is his strength.
That's what he does.

3566
02:38:56,780 --> 02:38:58,580
He's not a fighter.
He's not a martial artist.

3567
02:38:58,581 --> 02:39:00,530
He's not an athlete.
His sport,

3568
02:39:00,531 --> 02:39:05,531
his weight lifting.
If your goal is to lift as much weight 

3569
02:39:05,531 --> 02:39:09,551
as you can,
his system works extremely well because 

3570
02:39:09,551 --> 02:39:10,220
that is the sport,
right?

3571
02:39:10,310 --> 02:39:14,360
If you're an athlete and you want to use
strength training to better you and your

3572
02:39:14,361 --> 02:39:19,361
sport,
the majority of your time should be 

3573
02:39:19,361 --> 02:39:19,361
spent doing your sport.
Right?

3574
02:39:19,361 --> 02:39:20,450
Right.
So you,

3575
02:39:21,380 --> 02:39:26,380
the amount of weight isn't the most 
important thing necessarily because an 

3576
02:39:26,380 --> 02:39:28,010
athlete is not a strength specialist.

3577
02:39:28,430 --> 02:39:32,510
So once you can deadlift or press a 
certain amount of weight,

3578
02:39:32,930 --> 02:39:35,660
it's pretty much you're going to get 
diminishing returns.

3579
02:39:35,810 --> 02:39:37,640
I mean,
how strong do you need to be?

3580
02:39:37,670 --> 02:39:38,620
Right?
You know,

3581
02:39:38,630 --> 02:39:40,130
in a weight class sport.
I mean,

3582
02:39:40,131 --> 02:39:45,131
if you're,
if you're able to do a double body 

3583
02:39:45,131 --> 02:39:45,131
weight,
deadlift,

3584
02:39:45,131 --> 02:39:45,620
how much stronger you need to bear in 
order to get stronger,

3585
02:39:46,010 --> 02:39:51,010
you're going to have to specialize.
But that's going to take me away from 

3586
02:39:51,010 --> 02:39:52,550
the skills in my sport.
And also a lot of the,

3587
02:39:52,551 --> 02:39:53,990
uh,
low repetition stuff.

3588
02:39:54,260 --> 02:39:55,890
You know,
that they come from the field of,

3589
02:39:55,960 --> 02:39:57,020
of,
of weightlifting.

3590
02:39:57,200 --> 02:39:59,360
There's no doubt it's,
it's a strong dude,

3591
02:39:59,660 --> 02:40:03,650
but it's not necessary for me to do that
low of repetition when I'm just training

3592
02:40:03,651 --> 02:40:05,200
for general strength.
Well,

3593
02:40:05,201 --> 02:40:10,201
his philosophy or his claims are very 
interesting because what his claims are 

3594
02:40:10,201 --> 02:40:13,660
was that people doing these low rep,
uh,

3595
02:40:14,820 --> 02:40:19,820
exercises like five reps are under,
they experienced benefits and all of 

3596
02:40:19,820 --> 02:40:23,451
their sports and then it translated to 
all that power and strength translated 

3597
02:40:23,851 --> 02:40:25,100
to gymnastics.
And

3598
02:40:25,190 --> 02:40:30,190
Oh,
all extra strength training is going to 

3599
02:40:30,190 --> 02:40:32,451
translate into sports to an extent.
Olympic lifting works power lifting 

3600
02:40:32,451 --> 02:40:32,480
words,
you know,

3601
02:40:32,550 --> 02:40:34,290
low reps work,
high reps work.

3602
02:40:34,291 --> 02:40:38,490
I know many guys that did nothing but 
super high repetitions,

3603
02:40:38,491 --> 02:40:40,140
you know,
been plenty of guys like that.

3604
02:40:41,070 --> 02:40:46,070
It all works one way or another.
What you want though is to get as 

3605
02:40:46,070 --> 02:40:50,211
efficient as possible and you don't want
to be beat up for days after your 

3606
02:40:50,211 --> 02:40:50,211
workout.
Obviously.

3607
02:40:50,250 --> 02:40:52,500
That was one of the reasons why he liked
the little rep stuff,

3608
02:40:52,501 --> 02:40:53,070
you know,
because it,

3609
02:40:53,580 --> 02:40:56,040
it doesn't seem to beat you,
beat you up quite as much,

3610
02:40:56,220 --> 02:40:58,140
but I found that doing short,
brief,

3611
02:40:58,200 --> 02:41:01,680
intense workouts,
usually even single sets translated just

3612
02:41:01,681 --> 02:41:05,500
as well as is his anything.
I'll give you an example of.

3613
02:41:06,330 --> 02:41:10,140
You've heard of a 1973 Miami dolphins?
No,

3614
02:41:10,680 --> 02:41:12,790
they were the.
Only there were under Don Shula,

3615
02:41:13,170 --> 02:41:16,680
they're the only team to go undefeated 
and win the superbowl.

3616
02:41:16,890 --> 02:41:21,000
No other teams done it before.
Since ever in the history of the NFL.

3617
02:41:21,200 --> 02:41:25,800
They use cocaine well here in Miami,
but you know how they're trained.

3618
02:41:25,830 --> 02:41:29,490
They're trained a nautilus machines with
single set trend.

3619
02:41:30,180 --> 02:41:31,120
Why?
Yeah,

3620
02:41:31,710 --> 02:41:33,960
there we go.
So it all works.

3621
02:41:34,650 --> 02:41:37,110
It all works.
You can get in great shape,

3622
02:41:37,320 --> 02:41:40,200
no matter what you do is just what works
best,

3623
02:41:40,230 --> 02:41:43,800
what works best.
I personally believe for a lifetime,

3624
02:41:44,010 --> 02:41:45,630
and believe me,
I have a lifetime of vendors.

3625
02:41:45,870 --> 02:41:47,940
If you're getting hurt in your strength 
training,

3626
02:41:47,941 --> 02:41:52,941
you're doing something wrong.
Strength Training should prevent 

3627
02:41:52,941 --> 02:41:56,061
injuries not caused it.
So there's something wrong with your 

3628
02:41:56,061 --> 02:41:58,710
technique and your form.
Me being a wrestler and a Jujitsu Guy,

3629
02:41:58,950 --> 02:42:03,120
I can't afford to hurt myself and of 
course at my age now you get hurt.

3630
02:42:03,150 --> 02:42:05,670
Oh my God.
It takes for ever to get back.

3631
02:42:06,180 --> 02:42:09,870
We know that fast explosive training 
works,

3632
02:42:10,200 --> 02:42:13,470
but we also knows as a much higher 
chance of injury.

3633
02:42:13,980 --> 02:42:15,780
So for me,
I like slow,

3634
02:42:15,810 --> 02:42:20,810
high tension reps really controlled and 
like you discovered that slow negative.

3635
02:42:21,150 --> 02:42:21,630
Yeah,
slow,

3636
02:42:21,631 --> 02:42:26,631
negative,
seem to be having a really positive 

3637
02:42:26,631 --> 02:42:26,631
benefit on my training lately

3638
02:42:26,631 --> 02:42:28,080
and I found that,
that uh,

3639
02:42:28,160 --> 02:42:33,160
doing my exercises,
fasting supposedly did not make me 

3640
02:42:33,160 --> 02:42:36,581
faster on the mat.
I had to selectively pick the movements 

3641
02:42:36,581 --> 02:42:40,580
I want it to be fast and explosive bond 
and do those federal those and drill the

3642
02:42:40,581 --> 02:42:43,430
crap out of him until it was like a 
freaking machine.

3643
02:42:43,840 --> 02:42:46,960
One of the things that I've gotten into 
also over the last few months,

3644
02:42:47,110 --> 02:42:50,710
his grip strength.
Captains of crush.

3645
02:42:50,730 --> 02:42:54,820
Yes.
I have 167 pound one that I just smashed

3646
02:42:54,821 --> 02:42:59,821
that fucker.
I'd do it for three reps and then I 

3647
02:42:59,821 --> 02:43:02,131
throw it down.
Well thanks for taking it easy in my 

3648
02:43:02,131 --> 02:43:02,131
hammock.
We shook hands that well.

3649
02:43:02,131 --> 02:43:04,860
I started with 120 pound one and then 
uh,

3650
02:43:04,861 --> 02:43:09,040
I got 167 pounds one that I use now,
but I have a 200 and something pound one

3651
02:43:09,220 --> 02:43:12,150
that I'm saving for when I get tired.
One hundred 67 pound

3652
02:43:12,170 --> 02:43:13,410
one.
But it's like a,

3653
02:43:13,480 --> 02:43:16,260
there's a rabbit hole with that because 
I,

3654
02:43:16,310 --> 02:43:21,310
I'm,
I'm like a maintenance squeeze and 

3655
02:43:21,310 --> 02:43:21,310
things.
Now.

3656
02:43:21,310 --> 02:43:21,310
It's really weird.
It's like,

3657
02:43:21,310 --> 02:43:22,800
just make sure it's not people's hands.
Oh,

3658
02:43:22,850 --> 02:43:27,850
well I just have gotten excited about 
the idea of strengthening my hands 

3659
02:43:27,850 --> 02:43:30,610
because my strength hanning has all been
accidental for my hands.

3660
02:43:30,640 --> 02:43:35,640
It's all been just attached to dead 
lifts and Kettlebells and Chin ups and 

3661
02:43:35,651 --> 02:43:37,360
all the different stuff and that's how 
my hands got strong.

3662
02:43:37,540 --> 02:43:39,880
But I've never just actively trained my 
grip.

3663
02:43:40,330 --> 02:43:45,330
So when doing this I've been doing it 
like I'll say like four or five months 

3664
02:43:45,330 --> 02:43:48,631
now,
which has been just smashing these 

3665
02:43:48,631 --> 02:43:48,631
things all the time.
Well,

3666
02:43:48,631 --> 02:43:52,111
you know,
there there's different types of grip 

3667
02:43:52,111 --> 02:43:52,111
strength,
you know,

3668
02:43:52,111 --> 02:43:52,600
there's that crushing strength which the
captains of crush we give you,

3669
02:43:52,930 --> 02:43:54,910
but there's also like endurance 
strength,

3670
02:43:54,911 --> 02:43:56,740
which is really good bars for grappling.

3671
02:43:56,740 --> 02:43:59,140
Well just hanging off a high bar,
you know,

3672
02:43:59,260 --> 02:44:04,260
either 100 or two.
Well that's one of the things we found 

3673
02:44:04,260 --> 02:44:04,260
on fear factor.
That was interesting.

3674
02:44:04,260 --> 02:44:07,741
We did this thing where we had people 
hang all over water on a bar just 

3675
02:44:07,741 --> 02:44:09,730
hanging by their body weight and the 
women all beat them in.

3676
02:44:09,980 --> 02:44:14,140
We have strong men really like big yoked
up guys,

3677
02:44:14,141 --> 02:44:17,200
but they were too heavy and the light,
the weight ratio,

3678
02:44:17,230 --> 02:44:19,540
and they probably just did curls like 
bunch of bitches.

3679
02:44:20,400 --> 02:44:24,060
Well,
the grip is really a lot of it.

3680
02:44:24,880 --> 02:44:26,500
People just don't pay enough attention 
to it.

3681
02:44:26,930 --> 02:44:31,930
Uh,
one reason why rope climbing has stood 

3682
02:44:31,930 --> 02:44:34,021
the test of time as a grappling modality
is it's a very specific vertical type 

3683
02:44:34,021 --> 02:44:36,970
grip,
like grab a hand or a neck or a wrist or

3684
02:44:36,971 --> 02:44:40,450
forearm or even an ankle.
A really good for grapplers and man,

3685
02:44:40,451 --> 02:44:42,160
it takes tremendous grip to climb a 
rope.

3686
02:44:42,250 --> 02:44:44,430
Is a lot of stress on your joints?
Well,

3687
02:44:44,470 --> 02:44:45,380
there can be,
yeah,

3688
02:44:45,400 --> 02:44:48,340
you have to know how to climb,
but it's,

3689
02:44:48,370 --> 02:44:50,440
it has been an extra.
Hasn't been around forever.

3690
02:44:50,470 --> 02:44:52,360
Yeah.
I've got a big fat rope in my garage.

3691
02:44:52,390 --> 02:44:57,390
You know,
you've seen the gym that I have set up 

3692
02:44:57,390 --> 02:44:57,390
in my garage.
I got this rope that like,

3693
02:44:57,390 --> 02:44:57,390
I can't even get my hand all the way 
around it.

3694
02:44:57,390 --> 02:45:00,260
It's like one of those ropes that would 
tether off a,

3695
02:45:00,270 --> 02:45:01,780
an ocean liner.
That's what they're for.

3696
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:02,370
Yeah.
I mean,

3697
02:45:02,371 --> 02:45:04,140
that's where they get them,
but I'll tell you,

3698
02:45:04,180 --> 02:45:06,330
just hanging on that are squeezing it,
you know,

3699
02:45:06,340 --> 02:45:09,940
just not even climate.
Just hang it until your hand get that is

3700
02:45:09,941 --> 02:45:11,380
a tremendous grip exercise.
Oh,

3701
02:45:11,381 --> 02:45:12,610
for sure.
But um,

3702
02:45:12,790 --> 02:45:14,230
yeah,
for Jujitsu wrestling,

3703
02:45:14,231 --> 02:45:19,231
I found the captains of crush don't 
translate as well as doing things like 

3704
02:45:19,231 --> 02:45:19,630
Tao Chin ups,
you know,

3705
02:45:19,631 --> 02:45:23,080
obviously a climbing a rope.

3706
02:45:23,140 --> 02:45:27,390
A lot of guys throw a gooey over a chin 
up bar and just pull up with tactics,

3707
02:45:27,800 --> 02:45:32,800
specific grip strength and uh,
also just hanging for time like we've 

3708
02:45:33,451 --> 02:45:35,980
talked about for shoulder health,
awesome grip exercise.

3709
02:45:36,440 --> 02:45:41,050
And there's a very interesting 
correlation between a biological age and

3710
02:45:41,051 --> 02:45:42,570
chronological age.
You know,

3711
02:45:42,580 --> 02:45:44,980
old people have really weak hands,
you know.

3712
02:45:45,220 --> 02:45:48,970
So with that,
I'm like 20 smash it.

3713
02:45:49,270 --> 02:45:51,470
There you go.
Um,

3714
02:45:51,940 --> 02:45:53,150
I have a friend who,
um,

3715
02:45:53,290 --> 02:45:58,290
does the scapular exercises,
he's an archer and he hangs the way 

3716
02:45:59,201 --> 02:46:04,201
you're talking about.
And then when he gets to the hang 

3717
02:46:04,201 --> 02:46:05,970
position,
he just lifts himself fantastic exercise

3718
02:46:06,010 --> 02:46:11,010
and holds it.
He's like pinching his shoulder blades 

3719
02:46:11,010 --> 02:46:11,010
together,

3720
02:46:11,010 --> 02:46:13,940
just pulling his body up slightly with 
his arms completely locked out.

3721
02:46:14,110 --> 02:46:18,170
Those muscles have so collected and it's
good for posture to.

3722
02:46:18,320 --> 02:46:19,430
Yeah,
I'll tell you,

3723
02:46:19,431 --> 02:46:22,400
I'd like to superset that with a set of 
regular pull up sometimes.

3724
02:46:22,730 --> 02:46:24,360
Woo.
Do you feel that upper back?

3725
02:46:24,361 --> 02:46:25,730
As you know,
usually when you do pull ups,

3726
02:46:25,731 --> 02:46:30,090
your arms get tired first by,
by present,

3727
02:46:30,170 --> 02:46:31,890
preexisting,
the lats,

3728
02:46:32,180 --> 02:46:34,370
Rhomboids,
and you know your tears.

3729
02:46:34,430 --> 02:46:37,040
You know those back muscles.
Uh,

3730
02:46:37,070 --> 02:46:39,500
when you do your pull ups.
Whew man.

3731
02:46:39,530 --> 02:46:43,340
You really feel your back.
So you do pull ups.

3732
02:46:43,400 --> 02:46:45,790
I got all your sets.
Well,

3733
02:46:45,800 --> 02:46:48,320
not all the time,
but I would just the scapula retractions

3734
02:46:48,321 --> 02:46:49,460
first,
jumped down,

3735
02:46:49,461 --> 02:46:52,610
shake out my grip a little bit,
and then jump up and do the pull ups.

3736
02:46:53,030 --> 02:46:55,650
Wow.
What a great little back workout that.

3737
02:46:55,690 --> 02:46:57,910
Oh,
so you do this capital exercises first.

3738
02:46:58,460 --> 02:47:01,670
Pretty exhausted has those muscles 
because they're bigger and stronger than

3739
02:47:01,671 --> 02:47:03,500
your little teeny grip forearm.

3740
02:47:03,530 --> 02:47:07,130
And so usually what gives out first and 
pull ups is the hands,

3741
02:47:07,131 --> 02:47:08,720
the forearm,
sometimes your biceps.

3742
02:47:09,290 --> 02:47:12,590
So by pre fatiguing those upper back 
muscles first,

3743
02:47:13,190 --> 02:47:16,850
they get much better workout when you 
add in the arms.

3744
02:47:16,970 --> 02:47:18,080
Uh,
that makes sense.

3745
02:47:18,081 --> 02:47:20,000
It's temporarily fatigue.
Those.

3746
02:47:20,180 --> 02:47:25,180
So when you do these sets of when,
if you do like those scapular 

3747
02:47:25,180 --> 02:47:26,090
contractions,
what would you call those?

3748
02:47:26,710 --> 02:47:29,660
I always call them scapular retraction,
retraction,

3749
02:47:29,810 --> 02:47:30,590
retraction.
Um,

3750
02:47:30,591 --> 02:47:32,480
how long would you hold that position 
for?

3751
02:47:32,540 --> 02:47:34,930
I usually like two seconds up,
two seconds down.

3752
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:35,730
Oh,
short,

3753
02:47:36,020 --> 02:47:40,310
short little movement.
He's 15 second to when you could.

3754
02:47:40,850 --> 02:47:45,850
I've actually done static contraction 
where I just pulled myself up and held 

3755
02:47:45,850 --> 02:47:45,850
it so I couldn't hold it,
you know,

3756
02:47:45,850 --> 02:47:46,280
like,
uh,

3757
02:47:46,370 --> 02:47:48,020
like 30,
40 seconds,

3758
02:47:48,021 --> 02:47:49,040
you know,
just depends.

3759
02:47:49,070 --> 02:47:51,590
That was another thing that pavel was 
talking about with planks.

3760
02:47:51,800 --> 02:47:56,800
He was talking about like doing a plank,
but contracting every muscle in your 

3761
02:47:56,800 --> 02:47:57,890
body and holding that position.

3762
02:47:57,920 --> 02:47:59,990
It's an isometric.
That's called a,

3763
02:48:00,160 --> 02:48:01,900
uh,
overcoming isometric.

3764
02:48:02,420 --> 02:48:05,190
There's two types of evaluation metrics.
One is a,

3765
02:48:05,250 --> 02:48:06,920
I'm sorry,
a Yoni isometric,

3766
02:48:07,280 --> 02:48:09,260
uh,
one is where you have a measurable way.

3767
02:48:09,290 --> 02:48:14,290
It could be your body weight.
Let's say you hold a chin up at the top 

3768
02:48:14,290 --> 02:48:16,991
with your Chin over the bar.
It's a classic exercise called the 

3769
02:48:16,991 --> 02:48:16,991
flexed arm.
Hang.

3770
02:48:16,991 --> 02:48:17,660
Okay.
You have a measurable wait there,

3771
02:48:17,661 --> 02:48:22,661
right?
The other version of that would be you 

3772
02:48:22,661 --> 02:48:23,270
just grabbed something and just pull as 
hard as he can.

3773
02:48:23,540 --> 02:48:25,550
No way to measure it.
Both ways.

3774
02:48:25,551 --> 02:48:28,460
We'll get your strongest as can be 
strong as a beast,

3775
02:48:29,750 --> 02:48:32,290
so that plank that you're talking about 
it,

3776
02:48:32,291 --> 02:48:37,291
it's like a yielding isometric and that 
you have a measurable weight which is 

3777
02:48:37,291 --> 02:48:40,631
your body weight and rather than just 
hang out to see how long you can 

3778
02:48:40,631 --> 02:48:44,471
survive,
what happens is you start to let the 

3779
02:48:44,471 --> 02:48:45,500
bank collapse a little bit.
You start to relax certain areas of your

3780
02:48:45,501 --> 02:48:49,490
body and now it's just not nearly as 
effective,

3781
02:48:50,240 --> 02:48:54,170
but if you're really trying to shorten 
the abdominals and it really squeezing,

3782
02:48:54,171 --> 02:48:57,020
you create this tension,
you create a tremendous amount of muscle

3783
02:48:57,021 --> 02:49:02,021
fatigue in.
That should be the true purpose of 

3784
02:49:02,021 --> 02:49:02,021
exercise to create that,
that overload,

3785
02:49:02,021 --> 02:49:04,310
that muscle fatigue and allowing your 
muscles to recover from that.

3786
02:49:04,311 --> 02:49:07,240
And then it's the base of strength.
Yeah.

3787
02:49:07,590 --> 02:49:08,050
Um,

3788
02:49:08,150 --> 02:49:11,580
I have a friend and a lot of Jujitsu 
guys getting into this now where they're

3789
02:49:11,581 --> 02:49:14,190
doing super slow sets.
I love super slow,

3790
02:49:14,191 --> 02:49:18,390
says I was one of the original super 
slow trainers back in the day.

3791
02:49:18,690 --> 02:49:20,640
I still do.
And as a man ages,

3792
02:49:20,790 --> 02:49:23,610
and you have all the dings in your 
shoulders and elbows and stuff,

3793
02:49:23,910 --> 02:49:26,110
you'll find that you'll be drawn more 
and more to nice,

3794
02:49:26,130 --> 02:49:27,690
slow,
high tension sets,

3795
02:49:27,930 --> 02:49:29,370
real,
very safe way to train.

3796
02:49:29,910 --> 02:49:34,910
Um,
how many seconds up and down do you 

3797
02:49:34,910 --> 02:49:34,910
suggest like save for something like a 
chin up?

3798
02:49:34,910 --> 02:49:39,500
Well,
Mike Mentzer for bodyboarding 

3799
02:49:39,500 --> 02:49:41,901
hypertrophy,
he found like a four to four where you 

3800
02:49:41,901 --> 02:49:44,821
would like four seconds up,
pausing the contract position and four 

3801
02:49:44,821 --> 02:49:46,110
seconds down the contract position to 
push up.

3802
02:49:46,111 --> 02:49:48,420
The hard part would be the bottom part.
So,

3803
02:49:48,421 --> 02:49:51,030
you know,
just off the floor on a chin up,

3804
02:49:51,031 --> 02:49:51,990
it would be the top part.

3805
02:49:52,320 --> 02:49:54,420
So for a pushup,
say you would,

3806
02:49:54,421 --> 02:49:57,480
uh,
you would slowly go up for like one,

3807
02:49:57,540 --> 02:49:58,950
two,
three,

3808
02:49:58,960 --> 02:50:03,300
four turnaround.
Now you would then turn out or just have

3809
02:50:03,301 --> 02:50:05,390
a good back down and hold it the bottom 
line.

3810
02:50:05,400 --> 02:50:06,630
One,
two,

3811
02:50:06,690 --> 02:50:07,680
three,
four,

3812
02:50:07,681 --> 02:50:10,170
and then how long would you hold it over
a thousand bond.

3813
02:50:10,171 --> 02:50:12,720
One thousand two and then two seconds 
and then backup one,

3814
02:50:12,930 --> 02:50:17,930
and that's surprisingly difficult to do 
for someone who thinks of a pushup as 

3815
02:50:17,930 --> 02:50:18,930
being a pretty mild exercise.
Dude,

3816
02:50:18,960 --> 02:50:22,890
you can just sand blast yourself with 
just about five or six reps if you do it

3817
02:50:22,891 --> 02:50:23,640
right.
Yeah,

3818
02:50:23,760 --> 02:50:26,390
I've even done them slower.
I've gone like,

3819
02:50:26,510 --> 02:50:27,300
you know,
10,

3820
02:50:27,301 --> 02:50:28,500
10,
15,

3821
02:50:28,501 --> 02:50:32,160
15,
tried doing a try this if you'd like.

3822
02:50:32,161 --> 02:50:34,530
Negative accentuated sometime you're in 
a hotel room.

3823
02:50:34,531 --> 02:50:39,531
You want to get a quick pump for your 
comedy act to start at the top pump for 

3824
02:50:39,531 --> 02:50:39,531
comedy.

3825
02:50:39,531 --> 02:50:41,550
I stretch out.
You're a dude.

3826
02:50:43,190 --> 02:50:48,190
You got the rep,
but a private fit is con comic out 

3827
02:50:48,190 --> 02:50:52,581
there.
Don't you find that comics in general 

3828
02:50:52,581 --> 02:50:53,190
are pretty bad.
A lot of alcoholics and smoking.

3829
02:50:53,260 --> 02:50:54,490
A lot of small can.
Yeah.

3830
02:50:54,750 --> 02:50:56,990
The nature of the nightclub life,
you know,

3831
02:50:57,270 --> 02:51:00,870
it's very unhealthy.
It's also there's this false correlation

3832
02:51:00,871 --> 02:51:03,090
that you have to be an abuser of your 
body to be funny.

3833
02:51:03,600 --> 02:51:04,360
Really?
Yeah.

3834
02:51:04,361 --> 02:51:09,361
I know that a vanity and I'm taking care
of your body are connected and that 

3835
02:51:10,201 --> 02:51:13,830
vanity is ego and then having a big ego 
and being vain,

3836
02:51:13,890 --> 02:51:16,770
like it's anti comedy,
but I just think,

3837
02:51:17,010 --> 02:51:19,200
I don't think it's vanity to take care 
of your body.

3838
02:51:19,201 --> 02:51:24,201
I just think it's intelligence.
I think it's foolishness to not take 

3839
02:51:24,201 --> 02:51:24,201
care of your body.
I know.

3840
02:51:24,201 --> 02:51:28,401
I just know too many people's bodies are
literally falling apart and who are my 

3841
02:51:28,401 --> 02:51:31,920
age or younger who have massive issues 
seeing it myself,

3842
02:51:31,921 --> 02:51:32,190
man.

3843
02:51:32,190 --> 02:51:34,230
It's really scary.
Yeah,

3844
02:51:34,231 --> 02:51:39,231
and they realize with time the error of 
their way and it's usually too late if 

3845
02:51:39,231 --> 02:51:41,370
you start a rigorous physical fitness 
program,

3846
02:51:41,371 --> 02:51:46,371
but when you're 45 like boy,
you gotta kind have an uphill battle 

3847
02:51:46,371 --> 02:51:47,190
there and got an uphill battle.
Although I didn't pause.

3848
02:51:47,250 --> 02:51:48,360
Well,
you know Anthony Bordain,

3849
02:51:48,361 --> 02:51:50,570
you know what's going on with him.
He's a Jujitsu guy now.

3850
02:51:52,550 --> 02:51:57,550
He started at 58 of lifetime of drinking
and smoking and even a problem with 

3851
02:51:57,661 --> 02:51:59,820
heroin in his youth,
getting himself cleaned up.

3852
02:51:59,850 --> 02:52:01,530
I heard that.
I heard him present to it too.

3853
02:52:01,590 --> 02:52:02,790
Oh,
she's way beyond.

3854
02:52:02,791 --> 02:52:07,791
She's pretty good,
she's very good and she's obsessed and 

3855
02:52:07,791 --> 02:52:07,791
that's

3856
02:52:07,791 --> 02:52:11,040
one of the reasons why he got into it in
the first place because his wife is a 

3857
02:52:11,040 --> 02:52:11,040
maniac and he didn't want to get choked 
down.

3858
02:52:11,230 --> 02:52:11,590
Well,
no,

3859
02:52:11,591 --> 02:52:13,310
I mean she talked him into it because 
she,

3860
02:52:13,330 --> 02:52:17,740
she loves it so much and then once she 
actually bribed him with narcotics,

3861
02:52:18,070 --> 02:52:23,070
whoa.
That's how she got him in and she told 

3862
02:52:23,070 --> 02:52:23,070
him she'd given vicodins and so,
uh,

3863
02:52:23,070 --> 02:52:25,090
she,
she got him into it and then once he got

3864
02:52:25,091 --> 02:52:26,410
into it,
he's a,

3865
02:52:26,440 --> 02:52:28,780
he's a very,
and I say this in a good way,

3866
02:52:28,790 --> 02:52:31,330
he's very obsessive guy.
He gets obsessed with things,

3867
02:52:31,360 --> 02:52:36,360
you know,
that's why he's such a great chef and a 

3868
02:52:36,360 --> 02:52:36,460
great writer and he's great on his 
television show and he got obsessed with

3869
02:52:36,461 --> 02:52:37,840
Jujitsu.
He travels everywhere.

3870
02:52:37,841 --> 02:52:39,970
He brings his gay.
He trains everyday.

3871
02:52:40,090 --> 02:52:42,880
He trains twice a day.
He'll do a private and then they'll do a

3872
02:52:42,881 --> 02:52:43,990
class every day.

3873
02:52:44,140 --> 02:52:46,750
Everyday.
He trained with the Chris Crook.

3874
02:52:46,751 --> 02:52:48,040
The guy was talking about family.
My,

3875
02:52:48,070 --> 02:52:49,450
my web guy.
Yeah,

3876
02:52:50,500 --> 02:52:52,570
he trained with Anthony.
He said it was really fun.

3877
02:52:52,660 --> 02:52:54,180
That's awesome.
Oh,

3878
02:52:54,190 --> 02:52:57,850
back to that pushup.
So try starting at the top right?

3879
02:52:57,940 --> 02:53:00,760
You very slowly.
Usually your iphone,

3880
02:53:00,820 --> 02:53:02,410
like a little timer on there or 
something.

3881
02:53:02,590 --> 02:53:07,590
I use one with a metronome so I can hear
the text and I go on down in 30 seconds.

3882
02:53:07,990 --> 02:53:11,440
And when my chest just barely grazed 
instagram,

3883
02:53:11,800 --> 02:53:13,800
I do a slow,
what we call turnaround,

3884
02:53:13,810 --> 02:53:17,830
where you change direction very slowly.
Come back up in 30 seconds.

3885
02:53:18,310 --> 02:53:23,310
I don't walk out of the top.
There's no resting at the top because 

3886
02:53:23,310 --> 02:53:23,310
the top is just too easy.
Right?

3887
02:53:23,310 --> 02:53:26,560
You can hold it forever.
So I keep my elbows just a little unbent

3888
02:53:26,820 --> 02:53:30,310
and then 30 seconds back down dude,
you have the pump of your life.

3889
02:53:30,340 --> 02:53:33,760
Ninety seconds time under load.
It's like wow.

3890
02:53:33,761 --> 02:53:37,230
What an amazing workout.
One fricking rep,

3891
02:53:37,420 --> 02:53:39,370
Sassy one and a half Rep.
negative.

3892
02:53:39,371 --> 02:53:40,210
Positive,
negative.

3893
02:53:40,330 --> 02:53:41,590
Just negative.
Positive.

3894
02:53:41,591 --> 02:53:44,630
Negative for 90 seconds.
So do you set like a timer for them?

3895
02:53:45,660 --> 02:53:47,740
Not for 90 seconds.
Just this running stopwatch.

3896
02:53:48,220 --> 02:53:50,410
I,
I use like a little thing on my iphone.

3897
02:53:50,640 --> 02:53:51,880
It goes tick,
tick,

3898
02:53:52,390 --> 02:53:53,570
tick.
So what is it?

3899
02:53:54,430 --> 02:53:55,780
Uh,
what is it?

3900
02:53:55,781 --> 02:53:58,000
I don't know,
it's just one of those many apps,

3901
02:53:58,001 --> 02:54:00,070
but I wanted one that had an audible 
tick,

3902
02:54:00,071 --> 02:54:05,071
so if I can't actually see the iphone,
at least I can listen to the the 

3903
02:54:05,071 --> 02:54:08,740
seconds.
So it's real easy to fool yourself when 

3904
02:54:08,740 --> 02:54:08,740
going too fast.
No.

3905
02:54:08,740 --> 02:54:12,481
Do you do the same sort of technique for
squats or for any other exercises?

3906
02:54:12,851 --> 02:54:17,410
I have this one body weight squat where 
you faced the law where you can't unload

3907
02:54:17,411 --> 02:54:18,400
by meaning forward.

3908
02:54:18,400 --> 02:54:19,840
You know that your torso leaning 
forward.

3909
02:54:20,110 --> 02:54:21,640
Who Man?
What a killer.

3910
02:54:21,760 --> 02:54:23,620
You face the wall.
I faced the wall.

3911
02:54:23,800 --> 02:54:25,030
Great figure posture,
man.

3912
02:54:25,031 --> 02:54:27,040
Your toes against the wall.
So what are you doing?

3913
02:54:27,041 --> 02:54:29,800
Like you're facing the wall and how 
close are you to wall?

3914
02:54:30,220 --> 02:54:35,220
My toes knows everything's touching the 
knees and my hands are out to the side 

3915
02:54:35,220 --> 02:54:38,810
as slowly lower down and you keep your 
face on the wall so you know,

3916
02:54:39,000 --> 02:54:44,000
barely skimming and it's great for 
posture because your back is really 

3917
02:54:44,000 --> 02:54:47,221
arched.
So you're working isometrically and I 

3918
02:54:47,221 --> 02:54:50,371
don't do the top third of the movement 
with a body weight squat because it's 

3919
02:54:50,371 --> 02:54:53,611
just too damn easy.
I would recover so mechanically 

3920
02:54:53,611 --> 02:54:55,090
efficient at the top that there's no 
work,

3921
02:54:55,270 --> 02:54:57,880
so you get to the top third and then you
go back down again.

3922
02:54:57,881 --> 02:54:59,430
Damn.
Sometimes they use that 30,

3923
02:54:59,450 --> 02:55:00,550
30,
30 for that one.

3924
02:55:01,050 --> 02:55:02,380
It's absolute killer.
When you're done,

3925
02:55:02,381 --> 02:55:06,320
you just basically your legs are just 
crippled for a second or two.

3926
02:55:06,500 --> 02:55:11,500
I've been doing slow Hindu pushups and 
I'm just amazed at how tired you can get

3927
02:55:12,410 --> 02:55:17,410
a set of 20,
slow Hindu pushups in your heart is 

3928
02:55:17,410 --> 02:55:17,410
ready to explode.
It's amazing,

3929
02:55:17,410 --> 02:55:22,121
isn't it?
And you don't have to go fast to get a 

3930
02:55:22,121 --> 02:55:22,470
good cardio metabolic workout.
I'm a big fan of that Hindu pushup too,

3931
02:55:22,490 --> 02:55:27,490
just for the range of motion and such a 
wide range of motion in that spinal 

3932
02:55:27,831 --> 02:55:28,870
mobility.
Yeah.

3933
02:55:29,180 --> 02:55:34,180
I would say arguably that might be the 
only pushup a person would need just for

3934
02:55:35,361 --> 02:55:36,710
fitness,
you know?

3935
02:55:37,100 --> 02:55:42,100
I mean really it's a hell of a exercise.
It's basically upward and downward dog 

3936
02:55:42,100 --> 02:55:43,280
of yoga combined with the movement.
Yeah,

3937
02:55:43,281 --> 02:55:45,440
and I do it with a 40 pound weight vest 
sometimes.

3938
02:55:45,470 --> 02:55:46,640
Third Year a beast.
Well,

3939
02:55:46,641 --> 02:55:48,080
it's just such a great workout.

3940
02:55:48,170 --> 02:55:53,170
Just signed it down even more.
Try do in 10 seconds so you don't have 

3941
02:55:53,170 --> 02:55:55,430
to keep adding more weight to your vest.
Yeah,

3942
02:55:55,810 --> 02:55:57,980
well as I remember,
Tom Angelo is really important.

3943
02:55:58,310 --> 02:56:00,650
I'll give you an example.
I went to the gym one time.

3944
02:56:00,980 --> 02:56:03,890
I saw this guy just jacking off pull ups
like crazy.

3945
02:56:03,891 --> 02:56:06,740
He was using a lot of momentum.
It was basically one second.

3946
02:56:06,860 --> 02:56:07,620
One second.
Damn.

3947
02:56:08,060 --> 02:56:10,250
The dude did 25,
which is impressive,

3948
02:56:10,810 --> 02:56:15,810
you know,
but he was pretty much yanking up as 

3949
02:56:15,810 --> 02:56:15,810
joints,
you know,

3950
02:56:15,810 --> 02:56:16,460
so I had my client client do a set of 
six,

3951
02:56:16,730 --> 02:56:21,410
but he was doing for two for each one.
So the guy that did the 25,

3952
02:56:21,440 --> 02:56:25,250
his time under load is only 50 seconds.
My guy did six.

3953
02:56:25,370 --> 02:56:29,270
His time under load was a minute.
My Guy Actually did more mechanical work

3954
02:56:29,271 --> 02:56:31,730
and was physically in some ways 
stronger.

3955
02:56:31,760 --> 02:56:32,960
Better strength to weight ratio.

3956
02:56:33,530 --> 02:56:36,050
So what do you think about those 
crossfit style?

3957
02:56:36,160 --> 02:56:37,850
Put Chin ups.
Absolutely insane.

3958
02:56:39,080 --> 02:56:41,720
I mean La.
Well we talked about this last time.

3959
02:56:41,721 --> 02:56:45,610
That guy keeping that Greg glassman guy,
the guys in a beast.

3960
02:56:45,620 --> 02:56:47,030
Crippled man.
Well,

3961
02:56:47,031 --> 02:56:49,430
he's got health issues,
was a man.

3962
02:56:49,540 --> 02:56:52,080
I know that he kind of started.
The man is like,

3963
02:56:52,520 --> 02:56:53,480
what the fuck?
I could have.

3964
02:56:53,481 --> 02:56:57,980
I could have had health issues.
Usually the injuries that I've had,

3965
02:56:58,340 --> 02:57:00,080
if anyone has an excuse for not 
training,

3966
02:57:00,330 --> 02:57:02,000
I'm not.
I don't mean to toot my own horn,

3967
02:57:02,001 --> 02:57:07,001
but man,
I never missed a training due to an 

3968
02:57:07,001 --> 02:57:07,001
injury.
I always,

3969
02:57:07,001 --> 02:57:07,490
man,
if you hurt your shoulder,

3970
02:57:07,610 --> 02:57:12,610
you got your other shoulder and your 
legs that you can work into your core 

3971
02:57:12,610 --> 02:57:12,610
right there.
I.

3972
02:57:12,610 --> 02:57:14,510
I busted up my fault one time so you 
know,

3973
02:57:14,511 --> 02:57:16,550
I was able to work.
You always work around it.

3974
02:57:16,610 --> 02:57:17,450
There's something to do.

3975
02:57:17,510 --> 02:57:19,730
Always something to do.
Not Training,

3976
02:57:19,731 --> 02:57:24,731
just because you're injured.
I pull out L for my spine one time just 

3977
02:57:24,731 --> 02:57:27,260
doing the stupid abdominal roll outs 
from the feet.

3978
02:57:27,620 --> 02:57:29,210
What's an abdominal roy?
Oh,

3979
02:57:29,480 --> 02:57:32,720
I saw this Jackie Chan movie and I was 
really a.

3980
02:57:32,940 --> 02:57:37,940
You know,
you use those ab wheels and there's 

3981
02:57:37,940 --> 02:57:39,941
little wheels from your toes.
You roll the whole way out whole way 

3982
02:57:39,941 --> 02:57:39,941
back.
I was pretty good at that.

3983
02:57:39,941 --> 02:57:44,600
One time from your toes.
You roll the whole way out in the 

3984
02:57:44,600 --> 02:57:48,161
hallway back,
which I'm not exactly sure what you 

3985
02:57:48,161 --> 02:57:48,830
mean.
Can you ab Roller Jackie Chan.

3986
02:57:49,310 --> 02:57:53,160
This is pretty inspiring.
So you mean like you'd make a masters in

3987
02:57:53,550 --> 02:57:55,110
like a,
like an inch where.

3988
02:57:55,190 --> 02:57:55,910
Oh,
okay.

3989
02:57:55,970 --> 02:58:00,970
And you blew your back out to them.
Now I left my back is guy it started 

3990
02:58:00,970 --> 02:58:02,210
doing it.
Here got Derek go.

3991
02:58:02,550 --> 02:58:05,130
I could do that.
I probably still could do it,

3992
02:58:05,131 --> 02:58:06,420
but I'm just too afraid to do it.

3993
02:58:06,690 --> 02:58:08,710
Is that hard to do?
Fuck yeah.

3994
02:58:09,360 --> 02:58:11,650
It's unbelievable man.
Trying to.

3995
02:58:11,700 --> 02:58:16,700
Well No,
don't try because I don't want you hurt 

3996
02:58:16,700 --> 02:58:16,700
your back,
but you got to really,

3997
02:58:16,700 --> 02:58:20,451
really braced your abdominals and keep 
recruits tight because the shearing 

3998
02:58:20,451 --> 02:58:23,070
force on the lumbar is really high.
As I found out,

3999
02:58:23,250 --> 02:58:26,070
I don't do those,
but I do do a lot of ab wheel stuff,

4000
02:58:26,190 --> 02:58:28,830
but I just never do it like that.
You could do it off your knees.

4001
02:58:29,540 --> 02:58:32,070
It's the same movement is hanging leg 
raises.

4002
02:58:32,280 --> 02:58:34,740
Very safe.
Some people call it toes to bar.

4003
02:58:35,180 --> 02:58:37,590
Try doing it with no momentum.
Slow up.

4004
02:58:37,620 --> 02:58:40,350
Touch your tippy toes to bar pause for a
second.

4005
02:58:40,440 --> 02:58:43,440
Slowly lower if you do three or four.
Wow.

4006
02:58:43,441 --> 02:58:48,441
You're pretty strong core.
So it's the same level that with Lake 

4007
02:58:48,441 --> 02:58:48,441
Street?
Yeah,

4008
02:58:48,441 --> 02:58:53,331
with extra.
Like try to almost like you're touching 

4009
02:58:53,331 --> 02:58:53,331
your toes.
Toes to bar,

4010
02:58:53,331 --> 02:58:53,970
ankles or shins.

4011
02:58:53,970 --> 02:58:56,740
That means that person's too tight in 
the hamstrings.

4012
02:58:57,360 --> 02:58:58,290
But,
but yeah,

4013
02:58:58,291 --> 02:59:01,770
I blew my back.
I had an l for a subluxation.

4014
02:59:02,220 --> 02:59:06,300
And your thesis and uh,
I was told I might need surgery.

4015
02:59:06,790 --> 02:59:09,330
So the bulging disc.
Oh my God,

4016
02:59:09,331 --> 02:59:14,331
I had Sciatica so bad y'all.
I couldn't even walk when you were 

4017
02:59:14,331 --> 02:59:14,690
hanging.
He did I have the reverse hyper machine.

4018
02:59:14,700 --> 02:59:16,020
The bank when you were here?
Yes.

4019
02:59:16,021 --> 02:59:16,920
You did?
Yeah.

4020
02:59:16,921 --> 02:59:18,750
What do you think about those?
Have you used those at all?

4021
02:59:19,110 --> 02:59:24,110
I have,
but the strength curve I think I told 

4022
02:59:24,110 --> 02:59:26,241
you is off because right where your,
your glutes and your lower back or in 

4023
02:59:26,241 --> 02:59:29,190
the weakest part of the curve,
the resistance is at its highest.

4024
02:59:29,550 --> 02:59:30,720
Right?
I see what you're saying.

4025
02:59:30,721 --> 02:59:31,290
Yeah.
You know,

4026
02:59:31,291 --> 02:59:36,291
you'd almost be better off putting ankle
weights on and just doing a reverse leg 

4027
02:59:36,291 --> 02:59:36,291
raises.
Man,

4028
02:59:36,291 --> 02:59:40,491
I just love it though,
for a decompression of the spine and 

4029
02:59:40,491 --> 02:59:40,920
strengthening the,
the lower back area.

4030
02:59:41,190 --> 02:59:44,700
I mean that my whole back area is just 
so thick and strong from doing that.

4031
02:59:44,720 --> 02:59:46,890
That exercise,
it gives me a lot of relief.

4032
02:59:47,150 --> 02:59:48,720
I'm a,
I'm a big fan of that machine.

4033
02:59:48,960 --> 02:59:49,680
Yeah.
I mean,

4034
02:59:49,681 --> 02:59:51,150
I'm not against it per se.
Uh,

4035
02:59:51,180 --> 02:59:56,180
I think there is this as good if not 
better exercises that you can use 

4036
02:59:56,180 --> 02:59:56,180
because I mean,
you know,

4037
02:59:56,180 --> 02:59:56,940
in my case,
I,

4038
02:59:57,350 --> 02:59:59,310
I,
I can't travel with a reverse hyper.

4039
02:59:59,630 --> 03:00:04,630
Yeah,
you'd have a hard time checking that 

4040
03:00:04,630 --> 03:00:04,630
thing.
I'll tell you what I do enjoy is the,

4041
03:00:04,630 --> 03:00:05,940
uh,
a 45 degree,

4042
03:00:06,020 --> 03:00:09,510
a back extension bench where you do back
extensions.

4043
03:00:09,840 --> 03:00:12,570
Fantastic exercise is that called Roman 
chairs?

4044
03:00:12,571 --> 03:00:16,290
That was quite a Roman share,
but it's kind of along those lines.

4045
03:00:16,291 --> 03:00:18,000
I'm not talking about the glute ham 
raises.

4046
03:00:18,270 --> 03:00:20,760
I'm actually talking about 45 degree 
extension.

4047
03:00:21,190 --> 03:00:22,980
Uh,
I,

4048
03:00:23,030 --> 03:00:26,670
I was at Arthur Jones ranch when he was 
doing his experiments with Fedex,

4049
03:00:26,671 --> 03:00:27,440
which was a,
uh,

4050
03:00:27,640 --> 03:00:30,060
a machine for back rehabilitation.

4051
03:00:30,510 --> 03:00:34,740
And the medic studies is doing it with 
this Dr Wayne Pollack From University of

4052
03:00:34,740 --> 03:00:39,740
Florida medical school and they found 
that people's backs are pretty 

4053
03:00:39,740 --> 03:00:39,960
undeveloped and pretty weak and it can 
cause a lot of problems.

4054
03:00:40,230 --> 03:00:44,010
So they were trying to invent a machine 
to work that area,

4055
03:00:44,280 --> 03:00:47,100
but the freaking machines were like 
$50,000.

4056
03:00:47,340 --> 03:00:48,480
It was ridiculous.
You know,

4057
03:00:48,630 --> 03:00:51,150
you're getting all of these electrical 
feed out and all this stuff.

4058
03:00:51,360 --> 03:00:52,780
So I said to Arthur,
I said,

4059
03:00:52,781 --> 03:00:57,781
surely there must be a very simple 
exercise that you could do that would 

4060
03:00:57,781 --> 03:00:58,980
give you really,
really good results.

4061
03:00:58,990 --> 03:01:03,520
Because he was basically poopooing most 
back exercises is not really working the

4062
03:01:03,521 --> 03:01:08,521
back.
Most of them work the glutes and the 

4063
03:01:08,521 --> 03:01:10,741
hamstrings.
I kettlebell swings or deadlift more 

4064
03:01:10,741 --> 03:01:11,140
gluten hamster.
So he said the back extension,

4065
03:01:12,640 --> 03:01:17,640
he says that would come as close.
And I started religiously practicing 

4066
03:01:17,640 --> 03:01:18,580
back extension and man attire.

4067
03:01:18,670 --> 03:01:23,670
That's one area of my back.
That was always strong right up until 

4068
03:01:23,670 --> 03:01:24,260
that point where I did those abdominal 
rollouts.

4069
03:01:24,280 --> 03:01:25,770
That was the first package driver.
Hey,

4070
03:01:26,530 --> 03:01:28,390
how'd you get over that?
Well,

4071
03:01:28,420 --> 03:01:30,610
I went to a,
a raw for.

4072
03:01:30,820 --> 03:01:34,180
I had this woman that was actually a 
professor at the Rolf Institute,

4073
03:01:34,210 --> 03:01:34,620
you know,
they,

4074
03:01:34,650 --> 03:01:39,650
they,
they do circuits really good hands on 

4075
03:01:39,650 --> 03:01:43,111
rover.
She was the one that I heard the word 

4076
03:01:43,111 --> 03:01:43,111
surgery.
C'Mon Bruh.

4077
03:01:43,111 --> 03:01:43,990
Bath,
because she was pretty much anti surgery

4078
03:01:44,440 --> 03:01:46,270
as a first time I ever heard someone 
say,

4079
03:01:46,510 --> 03:01:48,550
oh Steve,
you really did it this time.

4080
03:01:48,820 --> 03:01:50,590
I don't know whether I can help you.
Really.

4081
03:01:50,830 --> 03:01:53,890
You really messed your backup.
I'm going to try,

4082
03:01:53,891 --> 03:01:58,891
but I can't guarantee anything.
So she would put me on their table like 

4083
03:01:58,891 --> 03:02:03,780
in a tense position where the table goes
like this with my bent or listening 

4084
03:02:05,831 --> 03:02:07,870
readily,
taking your fingers and trying to rotate

4085
03:02:07,871 --> 03:02:09,550
the vertebrae back into position.

4086
03:02:10,150 --> 03:02:12,760
And then I was going to this guy for 
pain.

4087
03:02:13,060 --> 03:02:15,070
I didn't want to take painkillers.
This Dr.

4088
03:02:15,160 --> 03:02:18,150
Frank Goo and Philadelphia and art 
straight a.

4089
03:02:18,580 --> 03:02:22,390
He was shooting me with the needles,
acupuncture,

4090
03:02:22,450 --> 03:02:27,250
acupuncture for pain relief.
And I would walk in absolute agony and I

4091
03:02:27,251 --> 03:02:32,080
would walk out probably 60 to 70 percent
reduction in the paint and it would last

4092
03:02:32,081 --> 03:02:33,820
for a day or two and then he'll come 
back of course.

4093
03:02:34,150 --> 03:02:39,150
But uh,
I was just doing it just to get out of 

4094
03:02:39,150 --> 03:02:41,260
pain and over the course of say how many
sessions was it?

4095
03:02:41,530 --> 03:02:44,320
It was like eight sessions by the 
eighth,

4096
03:02:44,380 --> 03:02:49,380
eighth session.
All of a sudden I woke up one day and 

4097
03:02:49,380 --> 03:02:51,100
the pain was completely so slowly 
relaxing in the disc was going back in,

4098
03:02:51,130 --> 03:02:56,050
finally squirted back in the stretching.
Anything like I was in a back chair,

4099
03:02:56,590 --> 03:03:01,590
uh,
I used to be the trainer for the owners 

4100
03:03:01,590 --> 03:03:01,590
of the Philadelphia Eagles.

4101
03:03:01,720 --> 03:03:04,150
The Jeff occurred scene,
or they're divorced now,

4102
03:03:04,151 --> 03:03:06,490
but jeff's still owns the Philadelphia 
team.

4103
03:03:06,940 --> 03:03:11,940
He used to have all these really cool 
nifty devices because he suffered a lot 

4104
03:03:11,940 --> 03:03:13,250
from back.
It was a chair that you sit on a sling,

4105
03:03:13,610 --> 03:03:18,610
like this playground swings with these 
two clamps and grab you underneath your 

4106
03:03:18,610 --> 03:03:19,750
armpits and clamp.
Right?

4107
03:03:19,960 --> 03:03:24,960
So your clamped,
you can adjust it and then you slowly 

4108
03:03:24,960 --> 03:03:27,810
release the slang.
So you're just basically sitting with 

4109
03:03:27,810 --> 03:03:29,920
your back completely just hanging there 
from your armpits.

4110
03:03:30,010 --> 03:03:35,010
Huh.
And I would sit there and watch tv for 

4111
03:03:35,010 --> 03:03:35,010
an hour or so with my back in this 
traction.

4112
03:03:35,770 --> 03:03:37,690
That really gave me a lot of relief.
Yeah.

4113
03:03:37,691 --> 03:03:39,650
Despite the decompression.
Yeah.

4114
03:03:39,660 --> 03:03:41,290
The back chair,
it was a really expensive thing.

4115
03:03:41,291 --> 03:03:43,900
I just borrowed it.
I borrowed his for like a couple months.

4116
03:03:44,200 --> 03:03:45,370
Man,
that thing really helped.

4117
03:03:45,640 --> 03:03:46,480
What do you think about those?

4118
03:03:46,590 --> 03:03:50,040
Like where those hangups were you like 
those?

4119
03:03:50,260 --> 03:03:55,260
I do a.
I didn't have the table where the room 

4120
03:03:55,260 --> 03:03:55,260
for it at the time,
although I do like it.

4121
03:03:55,260 --> 03:03:56,950
I did have an inversion boots that I 
used to hang off,

4122
03:03:57,050 --> 03:04:00,320
pull up on.
My problem was with the Sciatic.

4123
03:04:00,370 --> 03:04:03,440
I couldn't get into the position.
It was just too painful.

4124
03:04:04,070 --> 03:04:04,890
I had to,
you know,

4125
03:04:04,910 --> 03:04:07,520
I was in two minds are so far gone so 
far gone.

4126
03:04:07,940 --> 03:04:11,360
Everything was killing me,
but once it went away it was like,

4127
03:04:11,361 --> 03:04:13,610
it never happened.
Never happened.

4128
03:04:13,850 --> 03:04:16,520
But you know,
despite that I didn't stop training.

4129
03:04:16,910 --> 03:04:21,910
I was still doing super slow a machine.
We're pulldowns and chest presses and 

4130
03:04:23,480 --> 03:04:27,140
interestingly enough with that injury,
riding the Schwinn Airdyne,

4131
03:04:27,141 --> 03:04:32,141
you know,
those air bikes with the handles that 

4132
03:04:32,141 --> 03:04:32,141
did hurt,
it actually felt good.

4133
03:04:32,141 --> 03:04:36,730
I would feel good for like 30,
40 minutes after that workout with zero 

4134
03:04:36,730 --> 03:04:37,960
pain and then it would slowly come back 
on mega.

4135
03:04:38,240 --> 03:04:43,240
Those airdyne machine seemed to be like 
a really popular exercise for strength 

4136
03:04:43,491 --> 03:04:48,491
and conditioning for fighters.
Lot of wrestlers use them because I'll 

4137
03:04:48,491 --> 03:04:48,491
tell you a man's.
The faster you go,

4138
03:04:48,491 --> 03:04:49,760
the harder it is.
The air displacement.

4139
03:04:49,940 --> 03:04:54,940
The thing that's so cool about it is 
you're getting both upper and lower 

4140
03:04:54,940 --> 03:04:54,940
body.
Yeah.

4141
03:04:54,940 --> 03:04:59,140
So it's not just lower body aerobics.
Your whole body's involved in like a 

4142
03:04:59,140 --> 03:05:03,370
strength endurance.
Do those bother you with your shoulder 

4143
03:05:03,370 --> 03:05:03,530
leave shoulder?
Any kind of vertical movement?

4144
03:05:03,650 --> 03:05:06,570
I mean horizontal movement in price,
the overhead press that,

4145
03:05:07,100 --> 03:05:09,130
but interestingly enough I can still do 
Hindu pushups.

4146
03:05:09,620 --> 03:05:14,240
That is interesting.
It's the angle I can angle it and also,

4147
03:05:14,260 --> 03:05:16,910
you know,
corkscrewing the hands gripping a,

4148
03:05:16,940 --> 03:05:21,940
activating the lattes and all that kind 
of stuff can really keep you out of 

4149
03:05:21,940 --> 03:05:21,940
pain.
Steve,

4150
03:05:21,940 --> 03:05:23,300
we just did three hours.
Holy Shit.

4151
03:05:23,570 --> 03:05:24,800
Flew by.
Wow Man.

4152
03:05:26,300 --> 03:05:28,520
I know you have this video though.
Tell people about this video,

4153
03:05:28,521 --> 03:05:31,500
your isometric video.
I just came out with my second isometric

4154
03:05:31,530 --> 03:05:33,020
because I was so thrilled with the first
one.

4155
03:05:33,340 --> 03:05:38,340
Uh,
I started looking deeper and isometrics 

4156
03:05:38,340 --> 03:05:40,781
and I found these old school techniques 
that I've made an advanced isometric a 

4157
03:05:41,450 --> 03:05:42,670
video.
So is it a war,

4158
03:05:42,690 --> 03:05:44,450
a full workout,
and go through it.

4159
03:05:44,451 --> 03:05:49,451
What I did was in the first one I had 
either yielding or overcoming 

4160
03:05:49,451 --> 03:05:50,960
isometrics.
Here for vans,

4161
03:05:50,961 --> 03:05:54,480
guys are really strong like yourself.
I combine yielding,

4162
03:05:55,260 --> 03:06:00,260
yielding,
and overcoming isometrics in the same 

4163
03:06:00,260 --> 03:06:00,260
exercise.
And Boy,

4164
03:06:00,260 --> 03:06:01,530
I'll tell ya,
even an Olympic athlete could,

4165
03:06:01,700 --> 03:06:06,530
could get a full workout in a hotel room
with virtually no equipment.

4166
03:06:06,770 --> 03:06:09,350
Just your Jujitsu belt is all you'd 
really neat.

4167
03:06:09,860 --> 03:06:12,350
Dude,
you would know you had a workout.

4168
03:06:12,680 --> 03:06:14,310
Very safe,
no chance of.

4169
03:06:14,540 --> 03:06:17,660
I mean,
of course some Ada could screw it up and

4170
03:06:17,661 --> 03:06:22,661
get himself hurt,
but the chance of hurting yourself with 

4171
03:06:22,661 --> 03:06:23,510
isometrics is virtually none.
Good way to also work around an injury.

4172
03:06:23,690 --> 03:06:24,620
You know,
if you have a foot,

4173
03:06:24,621 --> 03:06:25,760
ankle,
knee,

4174
03:06:25,761 --> 03:06:28,280
elbow,
and you could still do isometrics,

4175
03:06:29,080 --> 03:06:31,160
uh,
you could even potentially do isometrics

4176
03:06:31,220 --> 03:06:34,040
if you're in bed.
You know,

4177
03:06:34,041 --> 03:06:39,041
let's say you had an injury in a car 
accident where you could actually keep 

4178
03:06:39,041 --> 03:06:40,940
your muscles in shape laying in bed.
Whoa.

4179
03:06:42,110 --> 03:06:43,820
It's pretty cool stuff.
Where can people get it?

4180
03:06:43,880 --> 03:06:48,380
How do they get it?

Yeah.
See Dot com.

4190
03:07:10,810 --> 03:07:12,810
Really good video.
I put a lot.

4191
03:07:12,820 --> 03:07:17,820
I did.
I shot it in a Malvasia Jitsu and it's 

4192
03:07:17,820 --> 03:07:17,820
really,
really,

4193
03:07:17,820 --> 03:07:18,190
uh,
uh,

4194
03:07:18,670 --> 03:07:20,940
one of the best ones I've ever done.
Alright,

4195
03:07:21,040 --> 03:07:26,040
beautiful.
And people want to get ahold of you on 

4196
03:07:26,040 --> 03:07:26,040
twitter.
It's twitter.

4197
03:07:26,040 --> 03:07:26,040
Steve Maxwell.
Sc.

4198
03:07:26,040 --> 03:07:28,690
Yup.
So you track all that jazz.

4199
03:07:29,000 --> 03:07:32,600
Instagram feed the media machine,
baby immediate machine he had got.

4200
03:07:32,620 --> 03:07:34,030
Thank you brother.
I appreciate you being on man.

4201
03:07:34,240 --> 03:07:35,500
Thanks for having me again.
Appreciate.

4202
03:07:35,630 --> 03:07:37,080
All right friends.
We'll be back tomorrow.

4203
03:07:37,090 --> 03:07:37,600
See you soon.
Bye.

4204
03:07:37,601 --> 03:07:37,780
Bye.
