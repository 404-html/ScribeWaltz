1
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,220
Johann hari.
I got it right.

2
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:10,320
You said it right.
You are literally the first person to

3
00:00:10,321 --> 00:00:11,660
have the same.
I was saint you fed that.

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:15,090
I once waited for six hours with a
broken arm in an emergency room because

5
00:00:15,091 --> 00:00:17,910
they were calling for Joanna Harry to
come forward to anyone who gets my name

6
00:00:17,911 --> 00:00:20,250
better than that.
It's just assumed that was you when you

7
00:00:20,251 --> 00:00:23,720
hear you heard Joanna.
I could all but I was lying that light,

8
00:00:23,721 --> 00:00:25,510
right.
We pig or be like Fox.

9
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,600
I want to help me so they have to get my
normal mind.

10
00:00:27,601 --> 00:00:29,760
I would have done what went down.
What went down with your arm.

11
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,790
I just,
I fell and I tried to do nothing.

12
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:34,400
No glamorous story too.
I fell down a staircase.

13
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,510
I wasn't even drunk.
I wasn't even fucked on anything.

14
00:00:36,511 --> 00:00:38,040
I just fell down the stairs.
It's right.

15
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:39,800
It's Daniel wasn't even a victim of
domestic violence,

16
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:40,643
you know,
like no,

17
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:41,700
no.
Uh,

18
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,650
surrounding narrative that we made that
an interesting story,

19
00:00:43,651 --> 00:00:46,890
sadly.
So give me your,

20
00:00:46,891 --> 00:00:51,891
if you had like a one paragraph take on
depression,

21
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,390
sure.
What is your take on depression?

22
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,120
So this is why I wrote this book,
lost connections and covering the real

23
00:00:57,121 --> 00:00:59,240
causes of depression and anxiety and the
real solutions.

24
00:00:59,241 --> 00:01:03,300
So
I wanted to understand why does

25
00:01:03,301 --> 00:01:04,710
depression and anxiety,
what is depression?

26
00:01:04,711 --> 00:01:07,560
Anxiety seems to be rising so much.
It's very personal to me.

27
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,480
When I was a teenager,
I had gone to my doctor.

28
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:11,790
I had explained that I was in this deep
sense of pain.

29
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,730
And all my doctor did was telling me a
biological story just said,

30
00:01:14,731 --> 00:01:17,760
basically your brain's broken.
And all he did was give me drugs,

31
00:01:17,761 --> 00:01:20,370
right?
And drugs play a role in treating

32
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:23,640
people.
But I was still depressed all that time.

33
00:01:23,641 --> 00:01:24,780
I was taking these drugs,
right?

34
00:01:24,781 --> 00:01:27,260
Most of the time.
And after 13 years ago,

35
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:27,691
I thought,
right,

36
00:01:27,691 --> 00:01:29,310
I need to understand what's really going
on here.

37
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:30,900
So I ended up going on this big,
long journey,

38
00:01:30,901 --> 00:01:33,960
over 40,000 miles interviewing the
leading experts in the world,

39
00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:36,120
and what causes depression and anxiety
and what solves them.

40
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:39,290
And what I discovered is the,
we've,

41
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:43,920
we've told ridiculously simplistic story
to people about what depression is and

42
00:01:43,921 --> 00:01:46,980
how to solve it.
That until I was a teenager.

43
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:48,510
Um,
and I went to my doctor,

44
00:01:48,511 --> 00:01:50,640
I thought depression was all in my head,
meaning,

45
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:51,760
you know,
you just been week,

46
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:54,450
he'd be in a Percy basically and then
the next day,

47
00:01:54,451 --> 00:01:55,980
10 years,
I thought it was all in my head.

48
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,860
Meaning you know,
it's a chemical imbalance in your brain.

49
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,940
What I discovered is a,
the overwhelming evidence from the World

50
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,260
Health Organization,
leading medical body in the world and

51
00:02:04,261 --> 00:02:07,710
loads of other places is there are real
biological factors that can make you

52
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:10,200
more sensitive to this stuff.
But the causes of depression,

53
00:02:10,201 --> 00:02:12,690
anxiety are overwhelming in the way
we're living there with these nine

54
00:02:12,691 --> 00:02:14,200
causes,
depression,

55
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,380
anxiety for which I could find
scientific evidence,

56
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,260
seven of which in the way we're living
and some of which are rising,

57
00:02:19,261 --> 00:02:22,560
which explains this kind of epidemic and
that opens up a whole different way of

58
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:23,760
finding solutions.

59
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:27,870
Now when you are young and you were
experiencing depression,

60
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:30,270
how would you categorize it?
Like what,

61
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,270
how would you describe it if you had to
describe it to someone who didn't

62
00:02:33,271 --> 00:02:35,100
understand depression?
Yeah.

63
00:02:35,101 --> 00:02:37,370
Try try to keep this amount of fist away
from sharks.

64
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:38,760
I think I'll move a bit closer to me.
Yeah.

65
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:42,930
I think depression,
depression is despair spreading.

66
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,060
Everyone has moments of hopelessness in
their lives,

67
00:02:45,061 --> 00:02:45,660
right?
Right.

68
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,990
It's that spreading further,
but I think one of the things I learned

69
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:53,040
is a deeper way of thinking about this,
which is everyone listening to this,

70
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:54,420
everyone watching this knows

71
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,580
they have natural physical needs,
right?

72
00:02:56,581 --> 00:02:58,320
You need food.
You need water.

73
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,040
You need clean air.
You need

74
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,720
warmth.
If I took those things away from you,

75
00:03:01,721 --> 00:03:03,520
you would be a real trouble real fast.
Right?

76
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,320
Right.
This is equally strong evidence that

77
00:03:05,321 --> 00:03:08,080
human beings have natural psychological
needs,

78
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,970
right?
You've got to feel you belong.

79
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,670
You've got to fill.
Your life has meaning and purpose.

80
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:15,280
You've got to feel that people see you
and value you.

81
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:16,870
You've got to feel that you've got
autonomy.

82
00:03:16,871 --> 00:03:19,330
You've got to feel that you've got a
future that makes sense,

83
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,310
and our culture is good at lots of
things.

84
00:03:21,311 --> 00:03:24,280
I'm glad to be alive today,
but our culture has been getting less

85
00:03:24,281 --> 00:03:28,570
and less good at meeting these deep,
underlying psychological needs for lots

86
00:03:28,571 --> 00:03:30,610
of people.
And that is the key reason.

87
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,590
So only one,
but it's the key reason why we have this

88
00:03:32,591 --> 00:03:34,540
rising depression,
anxiety epidemic.

89
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:35,830
That can sound a bit weird in the
abstracts.

90
00:03:35,831 --> 00:03:37,570
I can give you some specific examples if
you want.

91
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,433
Okay,
sure.

92
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:42,040
So I'll give you one example.
I noticed that lots of the people I know

93
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,890
who are depressed and anxious that
depression and anxiety focuses around

94
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:45,724
their work,
right?

95
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:49,330
Start to think what's going on here.
So I started to look for evidence about

96
00:03:49,331 --> 00:03:52,990
how people feel about their work.
Best Research on this was done by

97
00:03:52,991 --> 00:03:54,520
Gallup,
the opinion poll company,

98
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,620
massive detailed study to a couple of
years.

99
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:01,180
They found the figures for how people
feel about working in the u s and other

100
00:04:01,181 --> 00:04:04,450
comparable countries.
What they found is 13% of us,

101
00:04:04,451 --> 00:04:08,560
one 3% basically like our work,
most of the time we get energy from it.

102
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:12,610
63% of us or what they called sleep
working.

103
00:04:12,611 --> 00:04:15,070
So they like their work.
Don't hate their work,

104
00:04:15,071 --> 00:04:18,790
they're just kind of enduring it.
And 24% of people fucking hate their

105
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:19,420
work,
right?

106
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:22,270
Fear and dread it.
So I was quite struck by that when I

107
00:04:22,271 --> 00:04:22,570
looked at it.

108
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:27,570
That means 87% of people don't like the
thing they're doing most of the time.

109
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,290
That's incredible.
It's so striking.

110
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,360
And bear in mind,
this thing that we don't like is spread

111
00:04:31,361 --> 00:04:32,650
over even more of our lives.
Right?

112
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:37,950
Average person answers their first email
at 7:48 AM and leaves work at 7:15 PM so

113
00:04:38,831 --> 00:04:41,590
this is most of our waking lives.
We're doing something we don't like.

114
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:44,530
I started to think,
could there be some connection between

115
00:04:44,531 --> 00:04:48,130
that and this epidemic of awful sort of
forms of despair,

116
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,080
anxiety,
depression,

117
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,840
addiction.
So I start to look for,

118
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:54,910
scientists had studied this.
I discovered an amazing Australian

119
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,980
social scientist called Professor
Michael Marmot,

120
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:02,080
who I got to know who discovered the key
to what causes depression at work,

121
00:05:02,081 --> 00:05:03,340
right?
There's several aspects of this.

122
00:05:03,341 --> 00:05:05,140
I can tell you the story,
how he discovered it.

123
00:05:05,141 --> 00:05:06,940
If you want to think it's an amazing
story,

124
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:12,300
but the core of it is if you go to work
and you are controlled,

125
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:17,920
so you feel you have low or no control,
you are radically more likely to become

126
00:05:17,921 --> 00:05:18,580
depressed.

127
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:21,070
You're even more likely to have a stress
related heart attack.

128
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,500
And I think the reason is clear then
going a bit further than professor

129
00:05:23,501 --> 00:05:24,830
moment does.
Um,

130
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:26,920
human beings need to feel our lives have
meaning.

131
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,260
Right?
And if you're controlled all the time,

132
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,330
you don't feel like your life has
meaning.

133
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,720
You don't feel like you,
it disrupts your ability to create

134
00:05:34,721 --> 00:05:37,450
meaning out of your work and it makes
you feel like shit.

135
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,250
Right.
That makes sense.

136
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,830
And one of the things,
so one thing that was really important

137
00:05:41,831 --> 00:05:46,300
to me in everything I was learning in
the research for loss connections was

138
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:48,970
there was this,
it required this kind of shift in my

139
00:05:48,971 --> 00:05:52,000
mind because what I was basically told
by my doctor is,

140
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,430
your pain is a malfunction,
right?

141
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:55,480
He said,
you know,

142
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,640
we know what causes depression.
It's just some people naturally have low

143
00:05:58,641 --> 00:06:00,410
levels of Serotonin in their brains.

144
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,210
Um,
you know,

145
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,780
you're clearly one of them that that's
what's going on here.

146
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:08,210
And one thing that was really striking,
speaking to the leading experts in the

147
00:06:08,211 --> 00:06:11,120
world is that story is just not true.
There are real biological factors.

148
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:12,440
There are real things that happen in
your brain,

149
00:06:12,441 --> 00:06:15,140
obviously.
But actually a professor Andrew Skull at

150
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:18,620
Princeton University says it's deeply
misleading and unscientific to say

151
00:06:18,621 --> 00:06:20,360
depression is just caused by low
Serotonin,

152
00:06:20,361 --> 00:06:21,680
right?
This is just not true.

153
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:22,940
Um,
but,

154
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:26,090
but one thing that was so important to
me looking at these nine real causes of

155
00:06:26,091 --> 00:06:30,440
depression and anxiety was realizing
actually our pain makes sense,

156
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:32,120
right?
If you're depressed,

157
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:35,090
if you're anxious,
you've been told basically that you're a

158
00:06:35,091 --> 00:06:37,010
bit crazy.
There's something not working,

159
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,550
but actually you're not a machine with
broken parts,

160
00:06:40,551 --> 00:06:43,220
right?
You're a human being with unmet needs

161
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:45,620
and that requires a very different set
of responses.

162
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,960
So you think about,
I start to think,

163
00:06:46,961 --> 00:06:48,680
well,
let's think about that problem with

164
00:06:48,681 --> 00:06:49,370
work,
right?

165
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:52,160
Most people feel they've got no control
at work or low control,

166
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:55,130
and it's making them feel terrible.
They're not wrong to feel that,

167
00:06:55,131 --> 00:06:57,470
right?
They've got a need as human beings and

168
00:06:57,471 --> 00:06:59,660
it's not being met.
How can we deal with this?

169
00:06:59,661 --> 00:07:03,050
And I learned there's a really
interesting strategy to deal with this.

170
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,490
Now.
This is something some people will be

171
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:06,800
able to do as individuals,
but it's something we can actually

172
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:09,020
change as a society so far more people
could do it.

173
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,990
I went to Baltimore and I interviewed a
woman.

174
00:07:11,991 --> 00:07:15,920
Could Meredith Kio young woman,
meredith used to go to bed every Sunday

175
00:07:15,921 --> 00:07:18,470
night just fucking sick with anxiety.
Right?

176
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:19,304
She would,
she would,

177
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:21,890
she had an office job.
It wasn't the worst office job in the

178
00:07:21,891 --> 00:07:22,221
world.
Right?

179
00:07:22,221 --> 00:07:23,960
She wasn't being bullied,
she wasn't being harassed,

180
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,630
but she just,
she just felt like she just couldn't

181
00:07:26,631 --> 00:07:28,550
bear the thought of the next 40 years of
her life.

182
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:31,490
We're going to be this right.
And one day with her husband,

183
00:07:31,491 --> 00:07:33,380
Josh,
she is quite bold thing.

184
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:36,890
Josh was a working class guy from
Baltimore since he was a teenager.

185
00:07:36,891 --> 00:07:37,780
He that he'd,
um,

186
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:41,720
worked in bike stores and you know,
working at a bike store,

187
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:44,600
your viewers will know it's insecure
work.

188
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:48,110
It's controlled.
You do it boss tells you that you can

189
00:07:48,111 --> 00:07:49,760
get vacations and less the boss,
you know,

190
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,130
it's nice to,
yeah,

191
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:53,540
and Josh and his colleagues in the
store,

192
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:55,700
they didn't hate their boss.
He wasn't a particularly bad boss as far

193
00:07:55,701 --> 00:07:57,500
as policies go.
They quite liked him as a person.

194
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:01,310
But one day they just asked,
what does that boss actually do?

195
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:04,190
Right?
We fixed all the bikes and he seems to

196
00:08:04,191 --> 00:08:05,780
make all the money was what's going on
here.

197
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,110
They decided to do an experiment.
They,

198
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:08,770
they,
they,

199
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:10,750
they sit up at a different bike store,
arrival,

200
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:11,240
bike store.

201
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,450
It's called Baltimore Bicycle Works and
it works on a different principle.

202
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,660
So most people listening to this will
work in corporations.

203
00:08:17,661 --> 00:08:18,680
Right?
Top down,

204
00:08:18,681 --> 00:08:21,980
you do what the boss says.
It's modeled like an army that is a very

205
00:08:21,981 --> 00:08:25,670
recent human invention rights and comes
along in the late 19th century.

206
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,090
What they did was try different model.
They called democratic cooperatives.

207
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:33,650
So at Baltimore Bicycle Works,
they take all the big decisions together

208
00:08:33,651 --> 00:08:34,700
about their work.
They vote,

209
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:37,220
uh,
they share out the good tasks in the

210
00:08:37,221 --> 00:08:39,050
shitty tasks.
I know I can just get stuck with all the

211
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:41,780
shitty tasks.
They share the profits obviously.

212
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,880
So they control their environment
together.

213
00:08:43,881 --> 00:08:47,030
They're like a little tribe that control
their environment instead of an army

214
00:08:47,031 --> 00:08:50,330
with one guy at the top controlling it.
And one thing that was so fascinating

215
00:08:50,331 --> 00:08:52,970
spending time with them,
she's totally in finding a professor

216
00:08:52,971 --> 00:08:57,120
Michael Marmots research about what
causes depression at work is how many of

217
00:08:57,121 --> 00:09:00,510
them talked about having been really
depressed and anxious when they were,

218
00:09:00,511 --> 00:09:03,780
when they were working in this
controlled way and their depression and

219
00:09:03,781 --> 00:09:04,810
anxiety had largely gone.

220
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:07,530
It's to have bad days of course.
But there that kind of nagging

221
00:09:07,531 --> 00:09:10,680
depression and anxiety had gone away in
this different environment.

222
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:14,760
And as Josh said to me,
there's no reason why any business

223
00:09:14,761 --> 00:09:18,360
should work in this top down controlled
way that makes people depressed.

224
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:21,570
It's not even more efficient.
And study at Cornell University found

225
00:09:21,571 --> 00:09:24,810
that democratic businesses grow four
times faster than,

226
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,280
um,
than,

227
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:27,000
uh,
you know,

228
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,440
top down businesses.
And I think,

229
00:09:28,441 --> 00:09:29,820
well,
this opens up is a different way of

230
00:09:29,821 --> 00:09:32,580
thinking about depression.
So what we've done up to now is we've

231
00:09:32,581 --> 00:09:36,900
said to depressed and anxious people,
the job of fixing this is basically on

232
00:09:36,901 --> 00:09:37,890
you buddy,
right?

233
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:39,540
Maybe if you're lucky,
your family,

234
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:40,980
maybe if you're lucky,
your doctor,

235
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:44,100
but actually once you begin to realize
that the reasons why people are

236
00:09:44,101 --> 00:09:47,310
depressed and anxious makes sense.
This is just one of many reasons why

237
00:09:47,311 --> 00:09:48,840
people are depressed and anxious.

238
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,340
It also,
one of things is fueling the addiction

239
00:09:50,341 --> 00:09:52,470
crisis,
which you can talk about if you want.

240
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,810
And once you realize it,
it makes sense.

241
00:09:54,811 --> 00:09:57,540
You suddenly realize what you've got to
do is deal with the problem in the world

242
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:00,030
as well as the problem just in the
individual skull.

243
00:10:00,031 --> 00:10:00,970
Do you see what I mean?
Yeah.

244
00:10:00,971 --> 00:10:03,270
So you're focusing on work environments,
right?

245
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:04,363
Um,
and there's,

246
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:05,910
there's many reasons,
as you were saying,

247
00:10:05,911 --> 00:10:07,500
for,
for people being depressed.

248
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,960
Have you,
when you talk about work environments,

249
00:10:09,961 --> 00:10:12,540
have you researched people who are
independent,

250
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,800
people who work for themselves,
people who you know,

251
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,940
make things or make furniture or what
have you.

252
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,500
Yeah.
And that was one of the things as well

253
00:10:19,501 --> 00:10:23,010
at Baltimore Bicycle access,
most people are so removed from the

254
00:10:23,011 --> 00:10:24,360
product,
from their work,

255
00:10:24,361 --> 00:10:26,220
right,
from the outcome of their work.

256
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,980
To give you an example of a guy I
interviewed a lot,

257
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,930
um,
guy called Joe,

258
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:34,530
he works in Philly and he worked when I
met him in a paint,

259
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:35,490
a paint store,
right?

260
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:38,250
And Joe's job was to turn up,
but whatever it was,

261
00:10:38,251 --> 00:10:42,690
eight 30 in the morning,
stay there all day until 7:00 PM and

262
00:10:42,691 --> 00:10:45,240
just take your order for pain.
And then when you ask for a specific

263
00:10:45,241 --> 00:10:47,040
shade,
his job was to put it in a machine that

264
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:47,874
shook it,
right?

265
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,680
And then just give you the paint.
That's it.

266
00:10:49,681 --> 00:10:53,280
That was his whole life week after week,
year after year.

267
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,570
And Joe was acutely depressed and Joe
was really,

268
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,910
felt really guilty about telling me how
depressed he was.

269
00:10:59,911 --> 00:11:00,930
Right?
He kept saying,

270
00:11:00,931 --> 00:11:02,130
look,
I know how lucky I am.

271
00:11:02,131 --> 00:11:04,330
I know how lucky I am.
Um,

272
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,990
but he felt like it felt like shit.
And he said,

273
00:11:06,991 --> 00:11:08,340
I remember him saying to me,
look,

274
00:11:08,341 --> 00:11:09,750
I know people need pain.
Right?

275
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:11,610
It's not,
I know that have some function here in

276
00:11:11,611 --> 00:11:13,260
the economy,
I think to put it quite like that,

277
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:15,680
but this is not giving me any sense of
meaning.

278
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,930
But one of the real mysteries to me
about Joe and for that had to learn

279
00:11:18,931 --> 00:11:22,500
about one of the other causes of
depression and anxiety and solutions to

280
00:11:22,501 --> 00:11:25,620
that was so joe,
a lot of people,

281
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,080
some of my relatives who do work like
that,

282
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:31,410
that basically the margin for them to
change their lives,

283
00:11:31,411 --> 00:11:32,370
it's really narrow,
right?

284
00:11:32,371 --> 00:11:35,130
Like one of my closest relatives,
it's a struggling single mom.

285
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:37,080
Um,
you know,

286
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,640
she's,
she works every hour.

287
00:11:38,641 --> 00:11:40,350
She can,
she get something today collapses,

288
00:11:40,351 --> 00:11:41,910
right?
The idea of saying to her,

289
00:11:41,911 --> 00:11:44,610
your job now is to democratize your
workplace is ridiculous,

290
00:11:44,611 --> 00:11:45,960
right?
She can't do that.

291
00:11:45,961 --> 00:11:49,680
That's why most of lost connections is
about how we can change the culture to

292
00:11:49,681 --> 00:11:51,930
free people up to make the changes they
need to make.

293
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:54,520
Although there are things can do that I
go through in the book,

294
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:56,580
but the,
but the,

295
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:59,050
the,
a lot of people,

296
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,120
um,
how to put it,

297
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,870
they hit,
we live in such an individualistic

298
00:12:04,871 --> 00:12:07,900
culture that people think what you're
saying is you need to do it yourself.

299
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,780
But Joe was in an unusual position in
that Joe,

300
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,250
uh,
loved fishing,

301
00:12:12,251 --> 00:12:14,650
right?
He'd fished I think 20 of the 50 states,

302
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:16,510
and he'd recently been to Florida and he
said,

303
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,680
you know,
when I was in Florida,

304
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:21,700
I am,
I realized I could just quit this job.

305
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:23,500
I could go and live as a fisherman in
Florida.

306
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:26,440
I'd make less money.
I'd be much happier.

307
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:28,870
Right.
And there was somehow I knew as I was

308
00:12:28,871 --> 00:12:31,240
talking to joe and I filled it up with
them over the years that followed,

309
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,670
I knew he wasn't going to go to Florida.
Right.

310
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,860
And I remember,
no,

311
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:39,100
it's just the way he said it,
it was a wistful longing and not musical

312
00:12:39,101 --> 00:12:41,770
idea,
not something based on a real

313
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,660
possibility.
That's a really good way of putting it.

314
00:12:43,661 --> 00:12:46,840
But I remember the last time I saw him
and he walked off I and I felt like a

315
00:12:46,841 --> 00:12:49,060
complete Dick for doing this,
but I shouted after cause public.

316
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,860
So it's Toni Jo go to Florida.
Right?

317
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,601
Right.
And one of these,

318
00:12:52,601 --> 00:12:57,070
it really troubled me was why are so,
so a lot of people are trapped in the

319
00:12:57,071 --> 00:12:59,170
way our culture works,
which is why we've got to change the

320
00:12:59,171 --> 00:13:01,750
culture.
And I talk about specific concrete

321
00:13:01,751 --> 00:13:04,900
things that have been tried in other
countries that have freed people up and

322
00:13:04,901 --> 00:13:06,790
have reduced depressions.
I'm sure we'll get to that.

323
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,650
But if you think about an individual
like Joe,

324
00:13:08,651 --> 00:13:11,380
what's going on there?
And one of the things I learned from

325
00:13:11,381 --> 00:13:13,870
this amazing professor Tim Kasser in
Illinois,

326
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,870
Knox College in Illinois is I think one
of the things,

327
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:19,690
this is one of the hardest courses or
depression to learn about.

328
00:13:19,691 --> 00:13:22,180
Cause I realized how much it played out
in my own life as well.

329
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:27,600
So just like we all know junk food has
taken over our diets and made us

330
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:29,050
physically sick,
right?

331
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,710
Something similar has happened with our
minds are kind of junk values have taken

332
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:34,600
over our minds.
When I started learning about this,

333
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:38,780
I remember I ate nothing but junk food
for like 10 years from my twenties

334
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,260
basically.
And I remember one day,

335
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,520
it makes it even the story,
even Saturday,

336
00:13:43,521 --> 00:13:48,250
it was Christmas Eve in 2009 at
lunchtime I went to my local KFC and I

337
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,300
ordered,
set my order,

338
00:13:49,301 --> 00:13:51,250
which I won't even repeat it to you
cause it was so disgusting.

339
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:54,280
And the guy behind the counter said,
oh yeah man,

340
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,350
we're so glad you're here.
I was like,

341
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:57,071
okay.
And he said,

342
00:13:57,071 --> 00:13:57,904
wait a minute,
wait a minute.

343
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:03,180
And he went back and he came out and the
whole staff fucking massive Christmas

344
00:14:03,341 --> 00:14:06,400
card for me and they'd written it to our
best customer.

345
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:10,810
And my heart is like sang because I look
at this and I suddenly realized this

346
00:14:10,811 --> 00:14:13,060
wasn't even the fried chicken shop I
went to the most.

347
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:16,000
Right.
So I was at an extreme end of the junk

348
00:14:16,001 --> 00:14:16,781
food spectrum.
Right?

349
00:14:16,781 --> 00:14:18,790
I'm not anymore.
I've relapsed a bit lately,

350
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:19,803
but,
um,

351
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:21,910
but,
but so we all know how that works,

352
00:14:21,911 --> 00:14:24,280
right?
Junk food appeals to the part of us

353
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,720
evolve to what nutrients,
but it tricks that it's not actually a

354
00:14:28,721 --> 00:14:30,970
part of you that wants nutrients.
It actually makes you sick.

355
00:14:30,971 --> 00:14:33,010
Right.
And what Professor Casio Fan,

356
00:14:33,011 --> 00:14:34,660
this is the similar things happen in our
mind.

357
00:14:34,661 --> 00:14:35,660
So,
um,

358
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,140
weirdly,
so for thousands of years,

359
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:41,080
philosophers have said,
if you think life is about,

360
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:43,990
you know,
money and status and showing off,

361
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,670
you're going to feel like shit.
Right?

362
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:47,800
But it's not an exact quote from
Confucius,

363
00:14:47,801 --> 00:14:49,210
but as the gist of what he said.
Right.

364
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,640
But weirdly,
no one had scientifically investigated

365
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,470
this until,
uh,

366
00:14:54,471 --> 00:14:59,300
until Professor Cassa 25 years ago.
So he knew that basically to put it

367
00:14:59,301 --> 00:15:01,580
crudely,
there's two kinds of motives that human

368
00:15:01,581 --> 00:15:02,480
beings have,
right?

369
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,560
You've got them.
I've got them.

370
00:15:03,561 --> 00:15:04,790
Jamie's got them.
Everyone's got them.

371
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:05,820
Right.
Um,

372
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,440
the first that might just imagine,
imagine if you play the piano,

373
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:10,191
right?
I'm totally,

374
00:15:10,191 --> 00:15:12,230
I'm musical.
But imagine if you played the piano.

375
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:15,260
If you play the piano in the morning,
cause you love it.

376
00:15:15,261 --> 00:15:18,620
And it gives you joy.
That's called an intrinsic motive to

377
00:15:18,621 --> 00:15:19,490
play the piano,
right?

378
00:15:19,491 --> 00:15:20,920
You're not doing it to get anything out
there.

379
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,310
You're just doing it because you love
it.

380
00:15:22,311 --> 00:15:24,440
Right.
The experience is the point.

381
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,040
Now I imagine he played the piano in a
dive bar,

382
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,413
you know,
to,

383
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:31,190
to pay the rent and you don't like it,
right?

384
00:15:31,191 --> 00:15:34,520
Or you play the piano because your
parents really want you to be a piano

385
00:15:34,521 --> 00:15:36,020
maestro.
Don't know there's a woman who's really

386
00:15:36,021 --> 00:15:38,090
into pns,
so you learn the piano to impress her.

387
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:41,210
That would be an extrinsic reason to
play the piano,

388
00:15:41,211 --> 00:15:41,360
right?

389
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,920
You're not doing it for the thing
itself.

390
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,031
You're not,
you're not.

391
00:15:44,031 --> 00:15:45,500
You're doing it to get something out of
it.

392
00:15:45,501 --> 00:15:47,660
Right.
And what Professor Cassa discovered

393
00:15:47,661 --> 00:15:49,190
loads of really important things about
this,

394
00:15:49,191 --> 00:15:51,560
but there's a few.
We're all a mixture of these things,

395
00:15:51,561 --> 00:15:55,760
but we move throughout our lives.
And what we discovered is the more you

396
00:15:55,761 --> 00:15:59,570
are driven by extrinsic values,
the more your life is guided by how you

397
00:15:59,571 --> 00:16:03,620
look to the outside by you know,
what you're trying to get out of life

398
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:07,340
rather than enjoying it.
The more you will become depressed and

399
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:10,640
anxious by quite a large margin.
There's loads of studies that show this.

400
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:13,190
Um,
and also he found that we have become

401
00:16:13,191 --> 00:16:17,600
much more obsessed with much more driven
by these values over the last 30 years,

402
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:20,270
but all sorts of reasons,
partly because we,

403
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:22,910
from the minute we're born,
we're immersed in a machine that tells

404
00:16:22,911 --> 00:16:25,190
us life is about consumption,
right?

405
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:29,990
About externally consuming things more
18 month old children know what the

406
00:16:29,991 --> 00:16:32,780
Mcdonald's m means,
the know their own last name,

407
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,860
right?
So this,

408
00:16:33,861 --> 00:16:37,520
this machine constantly geared towards
getting us to think extra.

409
00:16:37,521 --> 00:16:39,490
As I mentioned,
imagine an advert that said to,

410
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,910
you know Joe,
you look great today.

411
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,050
You,
you smell great,

412
00:16:42,051 --> 00:16:43,100
you're doing fine,
right?

413
00:16:43,101 --> 00:16:45,800
You don't need to buy anything today.
That would from the perspective of the

414
00:16:45,801 --> 00:16:48,850
advertising industry be the worst,
worst advice ever.

415
00:16:48,851 --> 00:16:53,300
I would make you want to buy anything.
So this movement towards these kinds of

416
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:57,800
junk values and any shows,
lots of reasons why these junk values

417
00:16:57,801 --> 00:17:01,310
make us feel like share.
One is it just corrodes the quality of

418
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:02,750
your relationships,
right?

419
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:05,600
If your wife,
if you think your wife loves you,

420
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:08,990
not because you're you,
but because you're rich,

421
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:11,330
because you look good or for some other
reason,

422
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,970
then think about the insecurity that
enters into that relationship.

423
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:14,830
You know?
Oh,

424
00:17:14,831 --> 00:17:16,490
right.
If you suddenly got fat or if you

425
00:17:16,491 --> 00:17:18,650
suddenly lost all your money,
it's over.

426
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:22,490
It creates that.
That sand of insecurity enters all your

427
00:17:22,491 --> 00:17:25,190
relationships.
The more you're extrinsically motivated,

428
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,340
the more insecure your relationships
will be in the worst you'll feel.

429
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:32,120
Or another example would be something
that really makes human beings feel good

430
00:17:32,121 --> 00:17:34,360
or what are called flow states right
there.

431
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:37,490
Moments when you're doing something you
love the meats writing view.

432
00:17:37,491 --> 00:17:40,060
I'm sure it's partly broadcasting,
partly working out as you can see it.

433
00:17:40,061 --> 00:17:41,440
It's not working out for me.
Uh,

434
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:44,660
the,
the where you just get into the zone and

435
00:17:44,661 --> 00:17:47,330
time seems to collapse and you're in
that moment,

436
00:17:47,331 --> 00:17:50,580
right?
But what x thinking extrinsically,

437
00:17:50,581 --> 00:17:54,870
what being dominated by these junk
Bonnie's does is it jolts you out of the

438
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,120
intrinsic vice.
Imagine you'd go back to the piano

439
00:17:57,121 --> 00:17:59,280
example.
If you're playing the piano just because

440
00:17:59,281 --> 00:18:03,330
you love it and then suddenly you think,
am I the best piano player in Los

441
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:03,960
Angeles today?

442
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,550
Right?
How are these people in this room

443
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:08,820
thinking about my piano playing?
How much am I gonna be paid for this

444
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:10,950
piano player?
You can see how that would jolt you out

445
00:18:10,951 --> 00:18:11,960
of the flow state.
Right?

446
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:13,950
People,
the more we are driven by extrinsic

447
00:18:13,951 --> 00:18:15,930
values,
the less we get into flow states and the

448
00:18:15,931 --> 00:18:17,610
worst we feel.
And there's lots of other reasons as

449
00:18:17,611 --> 00:18:20,520
well one took about,
but well that completely makes sense

450
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:25,230
that relying constantly on other
people's approval and recognition and

451
00:18:25,231 --> 00:18:29,270
love in order for you to be satisfied
and happy isn't,

452
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:32,370
is not a good recipe for getting by in
this life smoothly.

453
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:35,370
Um,
when you were young and you were

454
00:18:35,371 --> 00:18:37,590
experiencing depression as you called
it,

455
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:40,800
what was the root cause of it?
So in my case it was a,

456
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:43,770
I mean there are a few things going on
and this is difficult for me to talk

457
00:18:43,771 --> 00:18:44,604
about,
but,

458
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:46,840
um,
one of the people I've got to know for

459
00:18:46,841 --> 00:18:51,060
the loss connections is this amazing guy
called Dr. Vincent Felitti and San

460
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:51,660
Diego.

461
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,490
And if you don't mind,
I'll tell you his story first and I'll

462
00:18:53,491 --> 00:18:56,730
tell you why.
What made me realize about myself and

463
00:18:56,731 --> 00:18:58,530
actually why I was very resistant to
this.

464
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:01,980
So it's going very resistant,
resistant to this insight that he had

465
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:05,320
and really did not want to absorb it.
Um,

466
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:09,420
so he actually made this discovery and
sca cycle talking about a whole other

467
00:19:09,421 --> 00:19:10,231
subject,
but trust me,

468
00:19:10,231 --> 00:19:12,030
I,
it gets to depression.

469
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,680
It led to an incredible breakthrough in
depression.

470
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:16,380
So in the mid 1980s,
doctor Felitti is doing all this

471
00:19:16,381 --> 00:19:18,720
research into obesity,
basically,

472
00:19:18,721 --> 00:19:22,620
Kaiser permanente or not for profit
medical provider down in San Diego,

473
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:25,050
um,
just had a massive fucking problem with

474
00:19:25,051 --> 00:19:25,801
obesity,
right?

475
00:19:25,801 --> 00:19:30,570
There is just hugely growing problem
with obesity and,

476
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:32,160
uh,
they were trying everything and nothing

477
00:19:32,161 --> 00:19:33,870
was worth like giving people nutritional
advice.

478
00:19:33,871 --> 00:19:35,100
That stage,
it wasn't working right?

479
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:38,040
So they basically said to him,
they gave him quite a big budget and

480
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:40,110
they're like,
just figuring out what the hell is going

481
00:19:40,111 --> 00:19:40,944
on here.

482
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:43,520
So he went away and he started,
he started to work within,

483
00:19:43,521 --> 00:19:46,770
think it was about 350 extremely obese
people,

484
00:19:46,771 --> 00:19:48,720
right?
People who are way more than 400 pounds.

485
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,600
And um,
he starts doing all sorts of different

486
00:19:51,601 --> 00:19:54,060
research with them.
And at one day he just had this,

487
00:19:54,061 --> 00:19:56,700
this kind of almost stupidly simple
thought.

488
00:19:57,150 --> 00:20:00,090
He thought,
what if they just literally stopped

489
00:20:00,091 --> 00:20:02,700
eating and we gave them the nutrients
they need?

490
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,090
Would they just lose loads of weight and
then come down to a healthy weight?

491
00:20:06,091 --> 00:20:09,000
So they obviously we'd like massive
medical supervision.

492
00:20:09,001 --> 00:20:10,740
They did this right?
People,

493
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:12,990
they just monitor them and they stop
eating and they give them loads of

494
00:20:12,991 --> 00:20:16,560
vitamins and everything and it worked
right?

495
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:19,890
They did in fact lose loads of weight.
But then something happened that no one

496
00:20:19,891 --> 00:20:20,641
expected.
There's a woman,

497
00:20:20,641 --> 00:20:23,220
I'm going to call Susan to protect her
medical confidentiality.

498
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:27,900
She been over 400 pounds.
She got down to 138 pounds and one and

499
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:30,630
everyone's celebrating.
They think vincent is like a miracle

500
00:20:30,631 --> 00:20:33,300
worker.
And then one day she freaks the fuck

501
00:20:33,301 --> 00:20:35,880
out.
Starts Massively obsessively eating.

502
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:38,910
And very quickly she's back to not quite
where she was,

503
00:20:38,911 --> 00:20:39,744
but close.
Right?

504
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:41,760
And Vincent sits with Susan and he's
like,

505
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:43,080
what happened?
And she's like,

506
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,640
I don't know.
And he said,

507
00:20:44,641 --> 00:20:46,140
well,
tell me about the day you cracked.

508
00:20:46,141 --> 00:20:47,920
Right.
Tell out something had happened to her

509
00:20:47,921 --> 00:20:51,550
that hadn't happened to her in I think
ever or sitting in a very long time.

510
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,890
A man hit on her right when she'd been
huge,

511
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,850
you know,
huge overweight,

512
00:20:54,851 --> 00:20:58,510
no matter down to a man hit on her.
And that was the trigger,

513
00:20:58,511 --> 00:20:59,010
right?
And he's like,

514
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:01,030
okay.
So they talk a lot more and it's like,

515
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:03,090
when was it you started to put on weight
for her?

516
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:05,200
It was when she was 11.
Um,

517
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:06,191
and so he's like,
well,

518
00:21:06,191 --> 00:21:07,480
what?
What happened when you were 11 that

519
00:21:07,481 --> 00:21:10,000
didn't happen when you were 10 that
didn't happen when you were 12 or 50.

520
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,313
And she said,
oh,

521
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:14,950
well that's when my grandfather started
raping me and he,

522
00:21:14,951 --> 00:21:18,970
this just really start with him.
So he starts talking to the group and

523
00:21:18,971 --> 00:21:22,000
he's got about 55% of the extremely
overweight people in the group.

524
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:26,380
I have 50% people in the group has had
on their way after being sexually

525
00:21:26,381 --> 00:21:27,310
abused.
Right.

526
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,400
Which was an extraordinary,
far more than the wider population is

527
00:21:30,401 --> 00:21:30,851
like,
wait,

528
00:21:30,851 --> 00:21:32,020
what's going on here?
This is really,

529
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,350
Susan said to him,
overweight is overlooked.

530
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:37,360
And that's what I wanted to be.
Right?

531
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:39,970
So this thing that had looked like a
pathology,

532
00:21:39,971 --> 00:21:41,140
right?
And it is a pathology.

533
00:21:41,141 --> 00:21:43,210
One sense being extremely overweight
will kill you.

534
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,580
Suddenly didn't look like a sign of
madness.

535
00:21:45,581 --> 00:21:48,340
It was actually performing a function
that we couldn't see,

536
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:49,630
right?
It was,

537
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:50,493
it was,
uh,

538
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,990
it was protecting them from sexual
attention.

539
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:54,430
But you know,
this is a small group.

540
00:21:54,431 --> 00:21:56,470
It's a small study.
So Vincent wanted to get a lot more

541
00:21:56,471 --> 00:21:57,850
research on this.
This is where it led to the breakthrough

542
00:21:57,851 --> 00:22:00,820
in depression.
So he set it up with funding from the

543
00:22:00,821 --> 00:22:02,410
CDC,
the Center for Disease Control,

544
00:22:02,411 --> 00:22:04,810
kind of gold plated a organization in
this,

545
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,420
uh,
in the u s for this kind of research.

546
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,410
Everyone who came to Kaiser Permanente
in the next,

547
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:12,670
uh,
I think it was a year,

548
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:14,380
uh,
for anything,

549
00:22:14,381 --> 00:22:16,680
whether you broke your leg,
you had migraines,

550
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,850
you had schizophrenia,
anything got given,

551
00:22:18,851 --> 00:22:21,550
a questionnaire and it asked about,
it had two parts.

552
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:22,121
Firstly,
it said,

553
00:22:22,121 --> 00:22:24,880
did any of these 10 bad things happen to
you when you were a kid?

554
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,070
Right?
Could be sexual abuse,

555
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,480
neglect,
that kind of thing.

556
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:31,240
And then it says,
have you had any of these problems as an

557
00:22:31,241 --> 00:22:34,420
adult obesity,
injecting drug use?

558
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:36,250
And at the last minute they added
depression,

559
00:22:36,251 --> 00:22:37,270
right?
By luck.

560
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,810
So when they got the results back,
the CDC,

561
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,390
we're just like,
what the fuck is this?

562
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:46,390
For every category of childhood trauma
you went through,

563
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:48,910
you weren't radically more likely to
become depressed.

564
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:51,790
If you had six of those categories,
you were 3000,

565
00:22:51,791 --> 00:22:54,430
100% more likely to have attempted
suicide as an adult.

566
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,370
If you were,
um,

567
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,480
if you'd had six of them,
you were 4,000,

568
00:22:58,481 --> 00:23:01,150
600% more likely to become an adult
injecting drug user.

569
00:23:01,151 --> 00:23:04,570
Right?
And there's a debate about why this is,

570
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:07,000
and I'm going beyond what Vincent says
now,

571
00:23:07,001 --> 00:23:08,270
but boom,
what the science says,

572
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:12,370
and this comes up,
brings it back to my experience.

573
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:13,870
So I had,
when I was a kid,

574
00:23:13,871 --> 00:23:17,740
I had expressed some very extreme acts
of violence from an adult in my family.

575
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:20,590
You know,
my mother had been very ill and when I

576
00:23:20,591 --> 00:23:23,170
was a kid,
my dad was mostly in another country.

577
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:24,910
And I experience,
he's really,

578
00:23:24,911 --> 00:23:26,440
really extreme,
um,

579
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:29,590
and frightening acts of violence.
And I

580
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:34,540
sound stupid.
But until I went to see Vinson,

581
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:37,420
if you'd asked me,
do you think that played a role in your

582
00:23:37,421 --> 00:23:38,770
depression?
I would have said no.

583
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,620
Right?
And it makes me realize one of the

584
00:23:41,621 --> 00:23:45,010
reasons why I clung to this very
simplistic chemical imbalance theory of

585
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:50,020
depression for so long,
because I did not want to give the

586
00:23:50,841 --> 00:23:53,750
individual who behave so appallingly
towards me,

587
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,990
that sense of power over me.
I didn't want to,

588
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:00,590
I didn't want to think about that stuff.
I want it to cauterize it.

589
00:24:00,591 --> 00:24:02,300
I wanted to cut it out of my life.
I would say,

590
00:24:02,301 --> 00:24:02,691
well,
okay,

591
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,010
that's bad thing that happens to you,
but you know,

592
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:07,370
but the,
but the reason why I stayed with this

593
00:24:07,371 --> 00:24:08,940
and the reason why I kept,
you know,

594
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:13,940
spent this time with Vincent in San
Diego and the reason why I kept going

595
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:17,120
with all these different causes of
depression and anxiety is because once

596
00:24:17,121 --> 00:24:19,430
you understand what's happened,
you can find solutions who otherwise

597
00:24:19,431 --> 00:24:21,670
didn't find,
there was a second stage of doctor

598
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,820
[inaudible] research.

599
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:25,850
That to me was so powerful.
It's one of the reasons why I make

600
00:24:25,851 --> 00:24:29,990
myself talk about this now.
So if you'd indicate it on the form that

601
00:24:29,991 --> 00:24:32,000
you'd experienced one of these forms of
childhood trauma,

602
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,980
the next time you went back to your
doctor,

603
00:24:33,981 --> 00:24:38,360
you weren't called back,
but the next time you went to your

604
00:24:38,361 --> 00:24:41,090
doctor,
your doctor was told to say something to

605
00:24:41,091 --> 00:24:42,740
you like,
hi Joe.

606
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:46,490
I see on the form you indicated that you
were violently abused when you were

607
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,220
child.
I'm really sorry that happened to you.

608
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:53,090
That should never have happened.
Would you like to talk about it and

609
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:54,590
quite a lot of people said thank you,
but no,

610
00:24:54,591 --> 00:24:57,210
I don't want to talk about that,
but a lot of people did want to about an

611
00:24:57,211 --> 00:25:01,070
average conversations is lost the five
minutes and then the doctor said,

612
00:25:01,071 --> 00:25:03,410
I can refer you to a therapist to talk
more about this if you want,

613
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:05,390
and they were monitored to see what
happened.

614
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,470
The results were kind of incredible.
There was an enormous fall in depression

615
00:25:09,471 --> 00:25:12,020
and anxiety just from the five minute
meeting.

616
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:13,400
Right,
and from the obvious,

617
00:25:13,401 --> 00:25:16,250
people refer to therapy,
so an even bigger fool and it seems to

618
00:25:16,251 --> 00:25:16,701
be,
again,

619
00:25:16,701 --> 00:25:18,950
this is going to be this bit,
it's going to be on what Vincent Said

620
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:20,030
said.
He said,

621
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:20,940
I asked him,
I said No.

622
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,440
I think partly what happens is it's
related to shame,

623
00:25:24,441 --> 00:25:27,440
right?
If you are a kid and you experience some

624
00:25:27,441 --> 00:25:29,820
kind of abuse,
you,

625
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:31,580
you can basically do one of two things,
right?

626
00:25:31,581 --> 00:25:32,600
You can either say,
look,

627
00:25:32,601 --> 00:25:33,710
I'm fucked here.
Right?

628
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:37,490
I've unlike a pinball being smacked
around a pinball machine because I can't

629
00:25:37,491 --> 00:25:40,820
stop this happening and I just got
accepted and I'm really vulnerable.

630
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:45,470
Or you can say,
this must be my fault at some level,

631
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:47,080
right?
Um,

632
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:48,020
which is what I did.

633
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:50,690
And of course it's what you've been told
anyway by whoever is treating you badly

634
00:25:50,691 --> 00:25:54,260
in almost every case.
And a weight thing is if you tell

635
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:59,261
yourself is your full Angelie,
you gain a sort of weird internal power,

636
00:25:59,361 --> 00:26:00,820
right?
You're not the pymble being smacked

637
00:26:00,821 --> 00:26:02,870
around the machine.
You're the person controlling the

638
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,370
pimples sheet.
You can change your behavior,

639
00:26:04,371 --> 00:26:05,204
right?
You can't,

640
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,470
you can't change other,
the pencils paper.

641
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:09,050
So you kind of develop this kind of
shame.

642
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:13,190
And one of the things we know is,
and there's plenty of evidence from

643
00:26:13,191 --> 00:26:14,900
this.
People like Professor Jim Pennebaker

644
00:26:14,901 --> 00:26:18,080
have shown it.
Shame is a catastrophe for human

645
00:26:18,081 --> 00:26:18,950
psychology,
right?

646
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:20,120
We know,
for example,

647
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:24,560
openly gay man died two years later than
closeted gay men in the age crisis,

648
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,900
even when they got medical care at the
same time,

649
00:26:26,901 --> 00:26:28,580
right?
Shame destroys you.

650
00:26:28,581 --> 00:26:31,760
It makes you sick.
And what Vincent found was this model of

651
00:26:31,761 --> 00:26:34,980
releasing your shame,
which led to the significant,

652
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:37,550
I remember one of the letters he got was
from an old woman,

653
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:41,510
she was in the 80s who just said she had
been sexually abused when she was a kid.

654
00:26:41,511 --> 00:26:42,890
And she said,
thank you for asking.

655
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:44,820
I thought I'd die and no one would ever
know.

656
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:49,470
And you can see how that release of
shame would have a transformative effect

657
00:26:49,471 --> 00:26:51,540
on people.
Wow.

658
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:55,620
So for you,
you had this traumatic experience of

659
00:26:55,621 --> 00:26:58,620
violence when you were young,
you were depressed,

660
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:02,100
you were trying to figure out what the
source of this was,

661
00:27:02,101 --> 00:27:04,440
whether it was some sort of a chemical
imbalance in your brain.

662
00:27:04,441 --> 00:27:05,080
Now,
when,

663
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,770
when they say chemical imbalances is in
the brain,

664
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:10,770
have,
are they capable of measuring the level

665
00:27:10,771 --> 00:27:12,180
of Serotonin in your brain?

666
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,010
Yes.
So there's a huge debate about this.

667
00:27:14,011 --> 00:27:14,880
She couldn't,
for example,

668
00:27:14,881 --> 00:27:16,500
do autopsies.
Um,

669
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:19,200
there's a big debate about,
but that's when someone's dead.

670
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:20,880
Yeah.
But there's a big debate about,

671
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:24,060
so there seems to be,
most scientists agree low,

672
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,800
not all of them.
And there are some people who dissent

673
00:27:25,801 --> 00:27:28,440
from this,
but most scientists agree low serotonin

674
00:27:28,441 --> 00:27:30,060
correlates with depression,
right?

675
00:27:30,061 --> 00:27:32,430
But it's not the same thing in the same
way stretch marks correlate with

676
00:27:32,431 --> 00:27:34,140
obesity,
but they're not the cause of obesity

677
00:27:34,141 --> 00:27:36,900
that the product of it.
So there are real brain changes that

678
00:27:36,901 --> 00:27:38,430
happen,
which I write about in Los Connections

679
00:27:38,431 --> 00:27:40,030
and important to say that,
um,

680
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:42,420
that I don't think they should be
described as chemical imbalances.

681
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:44,010
But one of these,
it was really shocking to me,

682
00:27:44,011 --> 00:27:46,080
was a,
one of the British experts on this Dr.

683
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,520
David Healey said to me,
um,

684
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:51,180
you can't even say the Sarah,
the idea that depression causes

685
00:27:51,181 --> 00:27:52,014
serotonin.

686
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:57,000
You can't even say that that theory is
discredited because it was never

687
00:27:57,001 --> 00:27:59,370
credited.
There was never a time when half of the

688
00:27:59,371 --> 00:28:01,140
scientists in the field believe that.
Right?

689
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:05,760
The reason that story got sold to me and
most people listening to this in the 90s

690
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:08,220
is because it worked really well for the
drug companies,

691
00:28:08,221 --> 00:28:09,720
right?
Because what it makes it sound like if

692
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:12,030
you've just got a chemical imbalance,
the solution is just to give you

693
00:28:12,031 --> 00:28:14,050
chemicals.
Now it's important to say chemical anti

694
00:28:14,051 --> 00:28:16,710
depressants do play a role.
We can measure that.

695
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:19,440
And there's a slightly nuanced point to
make about this,

696
00:28:19,441 --> 00:28:21,720
which is,
so depression is measured by something

697
00:28:21,721 --> 00:28:22,740
called the Hamilton Square,
right?

698
00:28:22,741 --> 00:28:24,780
I've always felt sorry for whoever
Hamilton was.

699
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:26,940
The only way we remember him is by how
fucking miserable we all.

700
00:28:26,941 --> 00:28:29,880
But anyway,
so how to scale goes from one where you

701
00:28:29,881 --> 00:28:30,810
are,
you know,

702
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:35,580
dancing around in ecstasy or on ecstasy
to 51 when you would be acutely

703
00:28:35,581 --> 00:28:36,270
suicidal.

704
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:38,640
Right?
And to give you a sense of what movement

705
00:28:38,641 --> 00:28:42,120
on the Hamilton scale looks like,
if you move six points on the Hamilton

706
00:28:42,121 --> 00:28:43,020
scale,
sorry,

707
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:46,440
if your sleep patterns get better,
you'll gain six points on the Hamilton

708
00:28:46,441 --> 00:28:48,420
scale.
And if your sleep patterns deteriorate,

709
00:28:48,421 --> 00:28:50,280
so you have a baby is crying all the
time,

710
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:52,890
you're generally lose six points on the
Hamilton scale,

711
00:28:52,891 --> 00:28:55,170
right?
So professor Irving Kirsch at Harvard

712
00:28:55,171 --> 00:28:57,060
medical school did the best research on
this,

713
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:02,300
and what he found is on average chemical
anti depressants move people 1.8 points

714
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:03,900
on the Hamilton scale,
right?

715
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,050
About a third of what?
Improving your sleep patterns does.

716
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:10,140
It's important to say that's an average.
So some people do get more than that.

717
00:29:10,141 --> 00:29:13,890
Some people get less,
and you can see 1.8 points is not

718
00:29:13,891 --> 00:29:14,431
nothing,
right?

719
00:29:14,431 --> 00:29:17,100
If you're acutely suicidal,
1.8 points can take the edge off.

720
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,380
There's real value in giving people that
relief,

721
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:21,810
but it's not solving the problem for
most people.

722
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:26,520
I thought I was weird for being on
antidepressants for so long and

723
00:29:26,521 --> 00:29:29,370
remaining depressed.
Turns out I was totally typical.

724
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:33,420
Couldn't doctor Steven [inaudible] is
professor of psychology has done a lot

725
00:29:33,421 --> 00:29:36,750
of work on this.
Between 65 and 80% of people taking

726
00:29:36,751 --> 00:29:38,400
chemical entity depressants become
depressed again.

727
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:41,230
Right?
So you can see that's not 100% there is

728
00:29:41,231 --> 00:29:41,730
some balance.

729
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:44,250
Well isn't that,
that's what a bill of fives for right is

730
00:29:44,251 --> 00:29:47,370
a bill of fire is the idea that your
antidepressant is not enough.

731
00:29:47,371 --> 00:29:50,370
So he take abilify on top of your
antidepressant,

732
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,020
which is supposed to help you even
further,

733
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:56,130
and it's one of the most prescribed
medications in the country and it's an

734
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:57,870
antipsychotic.
Yeah.

735
00:29:57,871 --> 00:29:59,070
Well this is terrifying.

736
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,570
The doling out.
I mean,

737
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,390
one in five Americans will take a
psychiatric drug in their lifetime,

738
00:30:03,391 --> 00:30:05,130
right?
It's a sign of a,

739
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:08,880
uh,
a cultural madness that we are doing

740
00:30:08,881 --> 00:30:11,400
this right where the,
now this is not to say that I want to

741
00:30:11,401 --> 00:30:13,290
stress again,
there is a real value in these drugs.

742
00:30:13,291 --> 00:30:14,910
There is some value to them,
there's some

743
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:17,050
value to them,
but they're most certainly over

744
00:30:17,051 --> 00:30:22,051
prescribed and there's most certainly
actual methods that you could use to

745
00:30:23,451 --> 00:30:27,830
improve your life without any sort of
chemical intervention that are readily

746
00:30:27,831 --> 00:30:30,230
available to everybody.
Like exercise and diet.

747
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:33,350
Yeah,
but those things aren't stressed when

748
00:30:33,351 --> 00:30:34,760
you,
when you go to a doctor,

749
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,500
the first thing the doctor doesn't say
is,

750
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,090
listen,
what we need to do is get you to start

751
00:30:38,091 --> 00:30:40,490
running and get you start eating really
healthy.

752
00:30:40,491 --> 00:30:41,870
And then let's talk about Antifa.

753
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,470
You're totally right.
There's a $10 billion industry and that

754
00:30:44,471 --> 00:30:47,290
doctor giving you drugs,
that's a crazy numbers you just said.

755
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:49,120
And,
and I think billion dollars.

756
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,200
He said,
this is why,

757
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:51,940
although there is a real value for those
drugs,

758
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:56,460
would the the the why this is the first
primary and for most people only option

759
00:30:56,461 --> 00:30:59,200
that's offered and one things that
really helped me change think about this

760
00:30:59,201 --> 00:31:02,860
differently and it fits exactly what
you're saying joe is I went to interview

761
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:06,820
this South African psychiatrist,
got Derrick summerfield and Derek

762
00:31:06,821 --> 00:31:10,240
happened to be in Cambodia when chemical
antidepressants were first introduced.

763
00:31:10,241 --> 00:31:12,310
Right.
That's where they were interested in

764
00:31:12,311 --> 00:31:13,750
energy.
He was just there when they were first

765
00:31:13,751 --> 00:31:16,150
introduced in Cambodia.
They thought that would have been one of

766
00:31:16,151 --> 00:31:20,050
the last countries in the world.
They made their way to and the Cambodian

767
00:31:20,051 --> 00:31:21,550
doctors didn't know what they were.
Right.

768
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:22,780
So they're like,
what is this?

769
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:26,200
And he explained and they said,
we don't need them.

770
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,390
We've already got antidepressants.
And he said,

771
00:31:28,391 --> 00:31:29,740
what do you mean?
He thought they were going to talk about

772
00:31:29,741 --> 00:31:31,480
some kind of like herbal remedy or
something.

773
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,230
Instead they told them a story.
There was a farmer in their community

774
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:38,980
who one day worked in the rice fields
who one day had stood on a land mine and

775
00:31:38,981 --> 00:31:41,970
got his leg blown off.
So they gave him an artificial limb and

776
00:31:41,971 --> 00:31:44,950
he went back to work in the rice fields.
But apparently it's super painful to

777
00:31:44,951 --> 00:31:47,530
work in water when your legs been,
you know,

778
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:49,990
we've got an artificial limit.
You legs been blown off and I'm guessing

779
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:52,900
it's pretty traumatic cause he's in the
fields where he's been blown up.

780
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:55,390
He starts to cry all day,
doesn't want to get out of bed.

781
00:31:55,391 --> 00:31:56,710
Classic depression,
right.

782
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,630
They said to Derek,
we gave him an antidepressant.

783
00:31:58,630 --> 00:31:59,463
He said,
what was it?

784
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:01,520
They said?
They explained,

785
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:04,000
they went and sat with him.
They listened to him.

786
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:08,240
They realized that his pain made sense.
They realize that actually make Patrick

787
00:32:08,241 --> 00:32:11,410
sense that he felt so bad.
They figured if they bought him a cow,

788
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:14,170
he could become a dairy farmer.
He wouldn't be in these fields where he

789
00:32:14,171 --> 00:32:16,480
was being fucked up.
So they bought him a car.

790
00:32:16,481 --> 00:32:17,770
Within a couple of weeks he stopped
crying.

791
00:32:17,771 --> 00:32:21,130
They said to Derek CC,
Dr Kao was an antidepressant.

792
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:24,370
That's what you mean right now.
If you've been raised to think about

793
00:32:24,371 --> 00:32:27,820
depression the way we have,
we've been propagandized to that sounds

794
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:28,750
like a bad joke,
right?

795
00:32:28,751 --> 00:32:29,990
I went to my doctor for an
antidepressant.

796
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:34,060
It gave me a cow.
If you understand what all these experts

797
00:32:34,061 --> 00:32:35,920
who I met had been interviewed
extensively,

798
00:32:35,921 --> 00:32:38,500
I've been trying to tell us it's going
to know what the World Health

799
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,333
Organization has been trying to tell us.

800
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:42,530
Those Cambodian doctors knew intuitively
what they knew through the science,

801
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:44,180
which is our pain.
Makes Sense,

802
00:32:44,181 --> 00:32:46,250
right?
You're not crazy to feel like shit.

803
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:49,880
You've got unmet needs and what you need
his help to get your needs met.

804
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:52,610
Now some of the things you're talking
about are really good examples.

805
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:53,510
Exercise,
Diet.

806
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,160
Some of them are these bigger
intervention.

807
00:32:55,161 --> 00:32:57,620
So one of the heroes,
a lot of connections is this doctor I've

808
00:32:57,621 --> 00:32:59,520
got to know called Sam Arrington,
who,

809
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:02,660
who is based in,
in east London actually,

810
00:33:02,661 --> 00:33:04,190
where near where I lived for a long
time,

811
00:33:04,191 --> 00:33:07,700
very poor part of east London.
And sadly he was never my doctor,

812
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:11,240
but Sam was really uncomfortable because
he's a general practitioners,

813
00:33:11,241 --> 00:33:13,910
general doctor.
Loads of people were coming to him with

814
00:33:13,911 --> 00:33:15,350
depression and anxiety.
Right.

815
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:17,780
And He'd been told him his medical
training,

816
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:20,870
even though he knew the science was much
more complicated than this to just say

817
00:33:20,871 --> 00:33:22,700
to people,
you know,

818
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:26,150
you've just got a chemical imbalance in
your brain and just drug them.

819
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,800
Right.
And Sam thought,

820
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:28,611
right,
like me,

821
00:33:28,611 --> 00:33:30,770
he's not opposed to the drugs.
He does give them out to some people,

822
00:33:30,771 --> 00:33:34,340
but he just thought this is,
this is not right.

823
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,620
This isn't dealing with the reason they
feel so shit.

824
00:33:36,621 --> 00:33:38,600
Right.
So he tried a different approach.

825
00:33:38,601 --> 00:33:41,750
He noticed that one of the factors that
was making the depressed and anxious was

826
00:33:41,751 --> 00:33:45,920
how profoundly lonely they were.
It's a study to ask the obvious in

827
00:33:45,921 --> 00:33:46,780
Britain,
but figures,

828
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:49,610
it's sort of Britain by Cuban American
examples to study the acid Americans.

829
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:53,450
How many close friends do you have who
you could call on in a crisis?

830
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:55,580
When they started doing the study years
ago,

831
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:58,400
the most common answer was five.
Today,

832
00:33:58,401 --> 00:34:00,860
the most common answer is none,
right?

833
00:34:00,861 --> 00:34:03,740
It's not the average,
but more people say none than any other

834
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:05,630
options.
So you think about that of people in

835
00:34:05,631 --> 00:34:08,960
America are more people in the United
States have nobody to turn to when

836
00:34:08,961 --> 00:34:10,760
there's a crisis than any other option,
right?

837
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:14,000
So you think about what life must be
like when you're alone.

838
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:16,940
That is not the species.
We are the reason why you and I sit in

839
00:34:16,941 --> 00:34:17,331
here,
Joe,

840
00:34:17,331 --> 00:34:19,610
in La,
the reason why we're alive is because

841
00:34:19,611 --> 00:34:23,120
our ancestors in Africa on the savannas
of Africa,

842
00:34:23,121 --> 00:34:24,890
what unbelievably good at one thing,
right?

843
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:27,500
They weren't bigger than the animals
they took down,

844
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:30,740
but they were much better at cooperating
then the animals they took down.

845
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:34,130
We exist because our ancestors formed
into tribes.

846
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:37,190
Every instinct we have is to live in a
tribe right?

847
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:39,470
Bees need a hive.
Humans need a tribe.

848
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:42,560
We are the first humans ever to try to
disband our tribes.

849
00:34:42,561 --> 00:34:44,510
Right.
No one's ever done that before in human

850
00:34:44,511 --> 00:34:46,180
history and it's quite running.
Yeah.

851
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:46,801
Well,
what do you,

852
00:34:46,801 --> 00:34:49,470
let me stop you there because we're
getting deep in the weeds here.

853
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:54,500
What do you say to someone who is happy
with what they do lives,

854
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:58,080
uh,
a fulfilled life exercises and is still

855
00:34:58,081 --> 00:34:59,100
depressed.
Yes.

856
00:34:59,101 --> 00:35:01,020
I thought a lot about this provoked me
to come back to the thing about east

857
00:35:01,021 --> 00:35:02,100
London.
I know this is,

858
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:03,800
this is an issue with a lot of people.
I,

859
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,970
yeah,
I know people that worship at the altar

860
00:35:05,971 --> 00:35:10,971
of science and modern medicine that
firmly believe that all depression is

861
00:35:11,041 --> 00:35:14,400
because of some sort of chemical
imbalance in the brain and anything that

862
00:35:14,401 --> 00:35:17,700
debates that are anything that disputes
that notion is,

863
00:35:17,701 --> 00:35:19,770
is pisses them off.
You know?

864
00:35:19,771 --> 00:35:21,610
I understand that.
And I would have been like that for me.

865
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:22,260
That,
yeah,

866
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,680
of course.
I was looking at a a years.

867
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:26,340
Do you get that?
Some people responding that way?

868
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,181
Sure,
of course.

869
00:35:27,181 --> 00:35:28,014
Of course.

870
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:30,650
I think the,
so the World Health Organization is the

871
00:35:30,651 --> 00:35:32,420
leading medical body in the world,
right?

872
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:36,950
They did a survey study of all the best
evidence and they explained very clearly

873
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:39,940
that the mental health,
um,

874
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:41,640
it's a social indicator,
right?

875
00:35:41,641 --> 00:35:43,800
It has social causes,
it needs social solutions as well as

876
00:35:43,801 --> 00:35:45,390
individual solutions,
the science.

877
00:35:45,391 --> 00:35:48,750
So this is overwhelming.
You won't get many scientists who say,

878
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:51,180
uh,
in fact it struggled to find any

879
00:35:51,181 --> 00:35:53,970
scientists who say depression is purely
a biological phenomenon.

880
00:35:53,971 --> 00:35:56,190
Right?
Pretty much everyone agrees there's some

881
00:35:56,191 --> 00:35:59,040
social and psychological component.
I think when we,

882
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:02,010
it's a weird disconnect between what the
scientists know and what the public is

883
00:36:02,011 --> 00:36:02,844
told.
Right?

884
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:06,180
I don't know anyone who went to their
doctor who,

885
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,610
um,
apart from this wonderful doctor in east

886
00:36:08,611 --> 00:36:12,000
London and we can talk about who went
with depression.

887
00:36:12,001 --> 00:36:13,320
I,
he was told anything other than a

888
00:36:13,321 --> 00:36:14,070
biological story.

889
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:15,180
Minute maybe asked,
you know,

890
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,100
some of them were asked about childhood,
you know,

891
00:36:17,101 --> 00:36:18,930
what was your childhood like?
And referred to a therapist.

892
00:36:18,931 --> 00:36:20,970
But no one was talking about these wider
social causes.

893
00:36:20,971 --> 00:36:21,511
No one was started.
Like,

894
00:36:21,511 --> 00:36:22,800
do you feel controlled at work?
Well,

895
00:36:22,801 --> 00:36:26,100
like it's a fact that could be making
you make you depressed.

896
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:27,780
But in terms of the people who,
who,

897
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,990
um,
who are depressed but don't,

898
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:32,590
uh,
cause there was a real mystery to me,

899
00:36:32,591 --> 00:36:33,411
right?
I knew people I thought,

900
00:36:33,411 --> 00:36:35,880
but this guy has got everything and he
feels he's still depressed.

901
00:36:35,881 --> 00:36:38,100
What's going on here?
I think there's two things to say about

902
00:36:38,101 --> 00:36:40,920
that.
One is I started to,

903
00:36:40,921 --> 00:36:42,510
uh,
for various reasons for research,

904
00:36:42,511 --> 00:36:45,570
for something else,
I was reading some like feminist texts

905
00:36:45,571 --> 00:36:47,160
from the early sixties.
Right?

906
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:50,550
And a really common thing that happened
in the early sixties is women would go

907
00:36:50,551 --> 00:36:52,680
to their doctor and they'd say,
doctor,

908
00:36:52,681 --> 00:36:54,120
there's something really wrong with my
nerves,

909
00:36:54,121 --> 00:36:55,680
people to talk about in terms of nerves.

910
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,220
Then we don't do that anymore.
Uh,

911
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:00,180
something really wrong with my nerves
because I've got everything a woman

912
00:37:00,181 --> 00:37:03,150
could possibly want.
I've got a husband who doesn't beat me.

913
00:37:03,151 --> 00:37:04,830
I've got a car,
got a washing machine,

914
00:37:04,831 --> 00:37:07,410
I've got two kids,
but I feel like shit.

915
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:08,401
Right?
And the doctor would go,

916
00:37:08,401 --> 00:37:09,450
you're right,
and give a value.

917
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,450
Now if we could travel back in time and
speak to those women,

918
00:37:12,451 --> 00:37:15,030
what we'd say is right,
you've got everything you could possibly

919
00:37:15,031 --> 00:37:18,420
want by the standards of the culture.
But it's standards,

920
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:19,830
the culture just wrong,
right?

921
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,630
As a w as a woman,
as a human being,

922
00:37:21,631 --> 00:37:24,060
you need more than just a washing
machine and a car,

923
00:37:24,061 --> 00:37:25,190
right?
You need a fulfilling life.

924
00:37:25,191 --> 00:37:28,290
You need to be a meaning and purpose.
And a very similar thing I think is

925
00:37:28,291 --> 00:37:30,750
happening today if you,
so if we don't want to speak to people,

926
00:37:30,751 --> 00:37:32,040
he said,
I've got everything I could want,

927
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:32,970
but I feel like share.

928
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:34,920
So tell me,
tell me about your life.

929
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:39,540
Very often they're working really hard
in prestigious jobs that they don't

930
00:37:39,541 --> 00:37:42,450
like.
They don't enjoy hour by hour to buy

931
00:37:42,451 --> 00:37:45,870
things that don't give them pleasure.
It comes back to this hijacking by junk

932
00:37:45,871 --> 00:37:48,900
values that we're talking about.
The professor Tim Kasser discovered.

933
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:53,340
So what you've got is because we've been
told a totally misleading story about

934
00:37:53,341 --> 00:37:55,710
what makes us satisfied and happy as
human beings.

935
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,320
I think it comes up again and again in
the interviews you do.

936
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:02,070
Cause we'd been taught in different ways
because we've been told him misleading

937
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:05,040
story about that we live our lives
according to the wrong script.

938
00:38:05,041 --> 00:38:07,320
We feel like shit.
And rather than question the script,

939
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:09,600
we think there must be something wrong
with us biologically.

940
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:12,060
Now there are biological contributions.
It's important to say that,

941
00:38:12,061 --> 00:38:14,520
but one of these,
it really blew my mind on this was um,

942
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:18,570
Ainsley this woman's amazing social
scientists could talk of Bretford in

943
00:38:18,571 --> 00:38:20,640
Berkeley.
She did this research.

944
00:38:20,641 --> 00:38:22,980
It's kind of simple research.
It just asked.

945
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:28,050
Um,
if you consciously decided you were

946
00:38:28,051 --> 00:38:31,410
going to spend more hours a day trying
to make yourself happier,

947
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:33,750
would you actually become happier?
Right?

948
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,130
And they did this research.
She didn't do a loan obviously

949
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:38,620
with our colleagues in the United
States,

950
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,820
uh,
Japan,

951
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:41,890
Russia,
and Taiwan.

952
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:47,200
And what they found was in the u s if
you try to make yourself happier

953
00:38:47,201 --> 00:38:50,380
consciously,
you do not become happier in the other

954
00:38:50,381 --> 00:38:52,990
countries.
If you try to make yourself happier,

955
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:55,360
you do become happier.
And they were like,

956
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:57,250
what's going on?
So they did more research.

957
00:38:57,251 --> 00:39:01,080
And what they discovered was in the u s
and suspend a lot more time here,

958
00:39:01,081 --> 00:39:04,180
but in Britain as well,
if you try to make yourself happier,

959
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:06,910
you tried to do something generally for
yourself.

960
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:10,330
You buy something for yourself.
Your biggest Alpha [inaudible] tried to

961
00:39:10,331 --> 00:39:14,260
get a promotion in the other countries.
Generally if you try to make yourself

962
00:39:14,261 --> 00:39:15,940
happy or you do something for someone
else,

963
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:17,980
right?
You tried to help your friends,

964
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:19,080
your family,
your community.

965
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:21,640
We're what countries?
Just Japan,

966
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:23,730
Russia,
and China is most of the race stress

967
00:39:23,731 --> 00:39:24,670
this,
that if you,

968
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:27,190
this is a part of their culture that if
you want to be happy,

969
00:39:27,191 --> 00:39:28,570
you do something for someone else.

970
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:32,200
It's so implicit in the culture that
they live collectively,

971
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:34,690
that it's not even just like we wouldn't
even if you said,

972
00:39:34,691 --> 00:39:36,340
do you think happiness is an
individualistic thing?

973
00:39:36,341 --> 00:39:37,600
We'd be like,
what are you even talking about?

974
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:40,900
Isn't that sort of an extrinsic idea as
well?

975
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:43,990
The idea that you're going to be happy
by trying to make other people happy,

976
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:46,630
but this is a thing.
So intrinsic values are not about just

977
00:39:46,631 --> 00:39:48,490
internal to yourself.
The things that you value,

978
00:39:48,491 --> 00:39:51,280
so your intrinsic value could be
spending time with your kids,

979
00:39:51,281 --> 00:39:52,890
right?
That was probably most people's

980
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:54,850
strongest intrinsic value.
If their parents,

981
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,980
it's being with their kids,
bonding with their kids,

982
00:39:56,981 --> 00:40:00,760
love.
My point is if your goal is to get happy

983
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:04,120
and the way you've chosen to get happy
is I'm going to get happy by making

984
00:40:04,121 --> 00:40:05,800
other people happy.
That's,

985
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:07,210
that seems very strange.

986
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:10,750
I don't think so and that's that.
If you think about where humans

987
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:14,290
shouldn't you just make other people
happy because you love them,

988
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:18,310
but that is a way of loving people and
being present with them is a way but not

989
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:23,610
as like a specific for with a specific
goal of making yourself happy.

990
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:27,700
That seems that's not why they do it.
It's not like when they were told make

991
00:40:27,701 --> 00:40:30,310
yourself happy.
They had an implicit script in their

992
00:40:30,311 --> 00:40:31,000
culture,
which is like,

993
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,080
all right,
if I want to make myself happy,

994
00:40:32,081 --> 00:40:34,960
I'll spend time with other people or do
things with other people.

995
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:36,880
But if you think about it in terms of
human evolution,

996
00:40:36,881 --> 00:40:37,960
it makes total sense,
right?

997
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:41,320
We think about our ancestors where they
evolved.

998
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:45,740
If you were a group,
if our ancestors had been individually,

999
00:40:45,741 --> 00:40:47,980
so we're out to big up themselves as
individuals,

1000
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:49,510
we wouldn't be having this conversation.

1001
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,270
Right.
So it makes us,

1002
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:53,600
we evolved as a species with instincts
that are,

1003
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:58,630
there's no argument there.
The the motivation of trying to get

1004
00:40:58,631 --> 00:41:02,020
happy by helping other people.
It just seems there's some implicit in

1005
00:41:02,021 --> 00:41:06,220
the culture for most people in say China
that they wouldn't even articulate it

1006
00:41:06,221 --> 00:41:07,870
that way.
It's only if you force them to say,

1007
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,700
look,
try to make yourself happier that they,

1008
00:41:09,701 --> 00:41:12,310
then the script becomes obvious.
It's implicit.

1009
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:15,370
But this script that we have,
this idea that the way you make yourself

1010
00:41:15,371 --> 00:41:18,250
happier is as an individual,
you know,

1011
00:41:18,251 --> 00:41:23,080
just doing something for yourself and
how you start because there is not one

1012
00:41:23,081 --> 00:41:25,270
script in this country of how to make
yourself happy.

1013
00:41:25,271 --> 00:41:29,020
That I think that's of sort of
disingenuous as I did at the only way to

1014
00:41:29,021 --> 00:41:31,740
make yourself happy is to do that.
What,

1015
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,710
that's not what people are trying to do.

1016
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:37,580
What people were trying to do is be
successful and I don't think they

1017
00:41:37,581 --> 00:41:40,160
necessarily equate success with
happiness.

1018
00:41:40,161 --> 00:41:43,040
What would they do?
Equate success with as an alleviation of

1019
00:41:43,041 --> 00:41:46,880
debt and the alleviation of problems and
alleviate a lot of the issues that

1020
00:41:46,881 --> 00:41:50,600
people face.
Hartley and they think of that as if you

1021
00:41:50,601 --> 00:41:52,460
look at the problems that you have when
you're growing up,

1022
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:55,220
you look at the price.
Especially if you grow up in a poor

1023
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:58,040
family,
one of the main problems that you face

1024
00:41:58,041 --> 00:41:59,600
is you're worried about paying your
bills.

1025
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:03,200
So you say some day I'm going to get to
a point where that is no longer an

1026
00:42:03,201 --> 00:42:04,520
issue.
I'm going to make it.

1027
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:06,720
I'm going to be successful.
They,

1028
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:09,920
they're not doing it thinking this is
going to make me happy.

1029
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:11,163
I I've,
I've,

1030
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:14,450
I very rarely see that and which is one
of the reasons why people,

1031
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:17,810
even people's parents in this freaks me
the fuck out.

1032
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:20,570
We'll tell them to not pursue their
dreams,

1033
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,960
but instead to pursue something that's
more likely to happen.

1034
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:29,470
Like don't pursue your dream of becoming
an actor or a singer or whatever it is.

1035
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:34,250
Instead pursue your dream of being the
foreman at the company you work at

1036
00:42:34,251 --> 00:42:37,790
because that's attainable.
I think you're totally right and there's

1037
00:42:37,791 --> 00:42:40,640
a lot of evidence that you're right,
that the financial anxiety is a massive

1038
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:43,640
driver,
depression and an anxiety.

1039
00:42:43,641 --> 00:42:47,630
Obviously there's a interesting study
that found people who have an income

1040
00:42:47,631 --> 00:42:51,680
from property are 10 times less likely
to develop an anxiety disorder that

1041
00:42:51,681 --> 00:42:53,510
people who don't,
and there was a really interesting

1042
00:42:53,511 --> 00:42:56,930
experiment in how we can respond to that
is when the President Obama said,

1043
00:42:56,931 --> 00:42:58,790
lay in his time,
he thinks would have to happen across

1044
00:42:58,791 --> 00:43:00,980
the country in the next 20 years for
various reasons.

1045
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:03,380
So in Canada,
in the 70s,

1046
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:07,400
the Canadian government chose a town at
random,

1047
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:08,780
it seems to genuine,
had been random.

1048
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:10,330
It's tangled dolphin.
It's,

1049
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:11,990
um,
anyone who knows a canter.

1050
00:43:11,991 --> 00:43:13,340
It's about four hours I,
winnipeg,

1051
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:16,310
and they said to big group of people in
this town,

1052
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,820
we're going to give you guys for the
next,

1053
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:21,830
for the foreseeable future,
we're going to give all of you a

1054
00:43:21,831 --> 00:43:24,410
guaranteed basic income.
We're going to give you the equivalent

1055
00:43:24,411 --> 00:43:26,570
of in today's money,
15,000 US dollars.

1056
00:43:26,571 --> 00:43:28,250
Right?
There's nothing you can do.

1057
00:43:28,251 --> 00:43:31,400
That means we'll take it away from you
and there's nothing you have to do in

1058
00:43:31,401 --> 00:43:33,500
return for it.
We're just citizens of our country.

1059
00:43:33,501 --> 00:43:34,820
We want you to have a good life,
right?

1060
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:37,010
It was partly because they had a kind of
welfare system,

1061
00:43:37,011 --> 00:43:39,620
but it was a lot of people were falling
through the cracks and they wanted to do

1062
00:43:39,621 --> 00:43:41,150
a little experiment to see with this
work better.

1063
00:43:41,570 --> 00:43:43,240
And this was studied very carefully by
women.

1064
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:45,450
I need to be called Doctor Evelyn for,
uh,

1065
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:47,870
to see what happened in loads of
interesting things happened.

1066
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,420
Um,
people spent more time with their kids.

1067
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:54,920
Very few people quit work,
but a lot of people turns down shitty

1068
00:43:54,921 --> 00:43:57,320
jobs.
So actual overall work standards

1069
00:43:57,321 --> 00:43:59,740
improved because employees have to
attract people with,

1070
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:01,640
with better standards.
Um,

1071
00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:03,680
but for me,
the most interesting thing is there was

1072
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:06,540
a huge full in depression and anxiety,
right?

1073
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:08,450
Depression and anxiety.
That was so severe.

1074
00:44:08,451 --> 00:44:11,390
People had to be hospitalized,
fell by 9%,

1075
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:15,200
which is remarkable in just three years.
And then the program ended.

1076
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:17,810
Dr for Jay said to me,
I thought was so much about that,

1077
00:44:17,870 --> 00:44:21,110
that I'd learned about the cow dot.
To Vj said,

1078
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:22,940
um,
you know,

1079
00:44:22,941 --> 00:44:24,300
that's an antidepressant,
right?

1080
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:28,100
We should expand our idea of an
antidepressant to be anything that

1081
00:44:28,101 --> 00:44:30,440
reduces depression,
if I should include pills,

1082
00:44:30,441 --> 00:44:31,800
but also so you're totally right.

1083
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:32,430
I mean,
look,

1084
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:33,240
I grew up,
my dad,

1085
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:35,490
my dad's a bus driver,
my mom worked in a shelter,

1086
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,140
my grandmother,
clean toilets,

1087
00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:40,050
financial anxiety is a massive driver
of,

1088
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:42,300
um,
of the despair.

1089
00:44:42,301 --> 00:44:44,670
This,
I mean more than half of all Americans

1090
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:47,730
have not because of the incredible
financial pressure they'd been put

1091
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:50,640
under.
Got $500 set aside for,

1092
00:44:50,641 --> 00:44:52,080
for crisis comes along.
Right?

1093
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:54,230
So you're talking about that's a huge
draw.

1094
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:55,590
And again,
that's really important cause explain to

1095
00:44:55,591 --> 00:44:57,480
people,
if that's making you depressed and

1096
00:44:57,481 --> 00:44:59,520
anxious,
don't let a doctor tell you you've just

1097
00:44:59,521 --> 00:45:01,530
got a chemical imbalance in your brain.
Right?

1098
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:04,740
That's,
we'll do doctors still say that all the

1099
00:45:04,741 --> 00:45:05,190
time.
My,

1100
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:07,050
my nephew's best friend,
um,

1101
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:09,720
just literally a couple of weeks ago
went to the doctor and was told,

1102
00:45:09,721 --> 00:45:11,040
yeah,
you've got a dopamine and balance.

1103
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:13,780
The doctor said is migrated in the 20
years since I went in there from a

1104
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:15,600
surgeon,
England in England.

1105
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,710
But I mean,
I get contacted constantly by people who

1106
00:45:17,711 --> 00:45:20,010
were being told they've got chemical,
they're told they've got chemical

1107
00:45:20,011 --> 00:45:22,860
imbalances in their brains.
They just as likely to prescribe

1108
00:45:22,861 --> 00:45:25,070
antidepressants in English as they are
American.

1109
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:26,310
I mean,
slightly lower,

1110
00:45:26,311 --> 00:45:28,380
but it's still exceptionally high
stills.

1111
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:32,010
Yeah.
There's that narrative that an

1112
00:45:32,011 --> 00:45:35,490
antidepressant must be in some sort of a
pill form and that navy,

1113
00:45:35,491 --> 00:45:38,790
even the expression,
antidepressant and antidepressant,

1114
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:43,320
it's a very confusing thing that we've
sort of adopted very quickly in this

1115
00:45:43,321 --> 00:45:45,900
country.
And it's a relatively recent,

1116
00:45:45,901 --> 00:45:47,670
you know,
over the last 60,

1117
00:45:47,671 --> 00:45:50,760
70 years.
And the people that have

1118
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:52,610
antidepressants,
uh,

1119
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:55,770
in their body that take them all the
time and swear by them,

1120
00:45:56,430 --> 00:45:58,110
boy,
if you try to tell them in,

1121
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:02,010
in any way that there's a better option,
they get extremely defensive.

1122
00:46:02,270 --> 00:46:03,420
Um,
I have friend,

1123
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:07,500
she's very smart and she's,
she's one of the,

1124
00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:10,440
um,
one of the people that will,

1125
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:15,750
you know,
very aggressively debate this idea that

1126
00:46:15,751 --> 00:46:17,460
it's anything but a chemical,
depression,

1127
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:18,990
chemical,
a inbounds,

1128
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:20,820
you know,
but she doesn't take care of her body.

1129
00:46:21,330 --> 00:46:23,460
She's not,
she doesn't exercise all the time.

1130
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,230
You know,
she's slightly overweight.

1131
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:28,200
She doesn't eat the best foods,
you know,

1132
00:46:28,201 --> 00:46:28,621
it's,
it's,

1133
00:46:28,621 --> 00:46:29,540
it's a weird thing.
Well,

1134
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:32,730
and she's living in a society and
culture that has all these forces that

1135
00:46:32,731 --> 00:46:34,440
are arising that things will feel
terrible.

1136
00:46:34,441 --> 00:46:37,320
Right.
And so a big thing to me is when I'm

1137
00:46:37,321 --> 00:46:38,890
talking to this,
because I've had some of that reaction

1138
00:46:38,891 --> 00:46:39,691
as well,
not too much,

1139
00:46:39,691 --> 00:46:41,310
but I've had some of that reaction as
well.

1140
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:44,640
First thing for me,
I would say I want to expand the menu of

1141
00:46:44,641 --> 00:46:46,320
options.
I don't want to take anything off the

1142
00:46:46,321 --> 00:46:47,010
table.
Right.

1143
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:47,843
It's not about,
oh,

1144
00:46:47,850 --> 00:46:48,960
you say that.
And I,

1145
00:46:48,961 --> 00:46:51,690
and I think you're probably being pretty
honest,

1146
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:54,780
but you really do want to,
you want to eliminate mode.

1147
00:46:55,260 --> 00:47:00,260
But just by the standard of improvement,
you do probably want to take most people

1148
00:47:00,811 --> 00:47:01,950
off of antidepressants.

1149
00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:05,010
Don't you want me to run it?
They have a choice.

1150
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:08,070
I would draw an analogy.
Obesity is massively risen in the

1151
00:47:08,071 --> 00:47:10,410
western world.
It hasn't risen because people suddenly

1152
00:47:10,411 --> 00:47:12,780
became greedy and lazy.
It's risen because our food system is

1153
00:47:12,781 --> 00:47:14,760
terrible.
The way feed supply system is terrible,

1154
00:47:14,761 --> 00:47:16,890
and we built cities that people can't
walk and bicycle around,

1155
00:47:16,891 --> 00:47:18,810
right?
And they're really stressed all the time

1156
00:47:18,811 --> 00:47:21,390
and they get home from work exhausted so
they don't have time to exercise a lot

1157
00:47:21,391 --> 00:47:24,930
of them in that context.
Some people will do what's the stomach

1158
00:47:24,931 --> 00:47:25,950
stapling,
liposuction,

1159
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:29,440
that kind of thing.
Right now I'm not against that.

1160
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:29,980
But

1161
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:33,340
if we change the society in the way that
I would want to with obesity so that

1162
00:47:33,341 --> 00:47:37,450
people could walk and cycle and you know
they had access to healthy food,

1163
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:40,630
far fewer people would need stomach
stapling or liposuction.

1164
00:47:40,631 --> 00:47:41,810
Right?
So I would drugs,

1165
00:47:41,830 --> 00:47:44,650
not a perfect analogy,
but I would say is if the social changes

1166
00:47:44,651 --> 00:47:47,740
that I want to happen happen.
If we followed the places that have

1167
00:47:47,741 --> 00:47:51,010
succeeded in reducing depression and
anxiety over time,

1168
00:47:51,011 --> 00:47:53,260
you would see fewer people feeling they
needed.

1169
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:57,670
And chemical antidepressants,
you read it with a couple of things.

1170
00:47:57,671 --> 00:47:59,530
First of all,
I don't think it's access to healthy

1171
00:47:59,531 --> 00:48:01,960
food.
I think most people have access to

1172
00:48:01,961 --> 00:48:03,580
healthy food.
They choose not to eat it.

1173
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:06,640
They choose to eat refined
carbohydrates,

1174
00:48:06,670 --> 00:48:09,130
high sugar foods,
fast food.

1175
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,870
Those are the things that are getting
people fat.

1176
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:14,380
And I don't,
I don't think that salad is so outside

1177
00:48:14,381 --> 00:48:15,760
of the reach of the normal person.

1178
00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:18,790
I just don't agree with that.
I just think that they make unhealthy

1179
00:48:18,791 --> 00:48:20,620
choices.
That's much more low end.

1180
00:48:20,621 --> 00:48:23,150
They get addicted,
but people make choices on carbohydrate.

1181
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:25,420
I understand what you're saying and I
think there's some truth in it,

1182
00:48:25,421 --> 00:48:27,250
but I think people make choices in a
context,

1183
00:48:27,251 --> 00:48:28,001
right?
So,

1184
00:48:28,001 --> 00:48:29,650
for example,
um,

1185
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:34,000
you know,
one of my relatives who is very

1186
00:48:34,001 --> 00:48:35,020
overweight,
you know,

1187
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:38,800
she's constantly fucking stressed
because she's trying to hold together so

1188
00:48:38,801 --> 00:48:43,060
much and one of the few reliefs in
pleasure she has is to eat too much.

1189
00:48:43,061 --> 00:48:45,820
Right?
And to eat pretty shitty food.

1190
00:48:45,821 --> 00:48:47,770
Right?
I'm not critical of her for that.

1191
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:51,910
I what I want is to help her change her
life and change the society in which we

1192
00:48:51,911 --> 00:48:54,530
live.
So she's not got that constant stress.

1193
00:48:54,531 --> 00:48:55,400
Do you know what I mean?
I mean,

1194
00:48:55,570 --> 00:48:57,190
I think at this,
in relation to addiction and you tweeted

1195
00:48:57,191 --> 00:48:58,030
one smart,
a Ted talk,

1196
00:48:58,031 --> 00:49:00,940
I gave everything you think you know
about addiction is wrong,

1197
00:49:01,330 --> 00:49:01,760
which approach?

1198
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:02,593
I'm grateful.
Thank you.

1199
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:04,180
[inaudible] which is based on my
previous,

1200
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,310
partly taken from my previous book,
chasing the scream,

1201
00:49:06,311 --> 00:49:08,800
which is about addiction.
And I think about what you're saying in

1202
00:49:08,801 --> 00:49:11,410
relation to that context.
So we had a lot of addiction in my

1203
00:49:11,411 --> 00:49:12,310
family.
And,

1204
00:49:12,670 --> 00:49:14,320
um,
you know,

1205
00:49:14,510 --> 00:49:15,910
one thing that really changed my mind
about this,

1206
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:19,450
and I think it really relates to what
you're saying about food is most people

1207
00:49:19,451 --> 00:49:20,590
think,
you know,

1208
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:22,630
addiction.
It is a drug addiction.

1209
00:49:22,631 --> 00:49:23,650
I say heroin addiction,
right?

1210
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:26,890
Which is very close to me.
Most with the heroin addiction.

1211
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,270
If said,
what causes heroin addiction,

1212
00:49:28,271 --> 00:49:31,300
they'd say Dark Heroin Causes Heroin
Addiction,

1213
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:33,160
right?
We've been told this story for a really

1214
00:49:33,161 --> 00:49:35,080
long time that,
um,

1215
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:36,910
you know,
if you took,

1216
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:39,430
if we kidnapped someone off the street,
we injected them all.

1217
00:49:39,490 --> 00:49:41,740
We injected them with heroin every day
for 20 days.

1218
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:43,840
At the end of that,
they'd have this desperate physical

1219
00:49:43,841 --> 00:49:45,760
hunger for the chemical hooks in heroin.

1220
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,500
Their body would desperately need it,
and that's,

1221
00:49:48,530 --> 00:49:50,680
that's why they would be addicted,
right?

1222
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:52,110
First thing that alerts him.
In fact,

1223
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:54,850
something not right about that is when
it was explained to me in Britain,

1224
00:49:55,270 --> 00:49:58,600
if you get hit by a truck and you know
your break your hip and you're taken to

1225
00:49:58,601 --> 00:50:00,970
a hospital,
you'll be given loads of a drug called

1226
00:50:00,971 --> 00:50:01,990
diamorphine.
Right?

1227
00:50:01,991 --> 00:50:05,740
For the pain diamorphine is heroin is
much better than street heroin because

1228
00:50:05,741 --> 00:50:06,850
it's medically pure,
right?

1229
00:50:07,090 --> 00:50:10,180
If anyone listening to this as a British
grandmother who had a hip replacement

1230
00:50:10,181 --> 00:50:12,090
operation,
your grandmother's taken a lot of

1231
00:50:12,091 --> 00:50:12,924
heroin,
right?

1232
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:16,030
If what we've been told about the
chemical hooks is right,

1233
00:50:16,330 --> 00:50:18,310
what should be happening to all these
people in hospital?

1234
00:50:18,670 --> 00:50:20,320
Loads of them should be becoming
addicted.

1235
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:23,250
It doesn't happen in Britain with with
people who are given Domo theme,

1236
00:50:23,450 --> 00:50:24,131
so it's like,
well,

1237
00:50:24,131 --> 00:50:24,910
wait,
what's going on?

1238
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:27,920
I only began to understand it when I
went to Vancouver and needs to be this

1239
00:50:27,921 --> 00:50:30,470
incredible professor.
They're called Bruce Alexander did this

1240
00:50:30,471 --> 00:50:32,150
experiment.
It's changed how we think about

1241
00:50:32,151 --> 00:50:34,280
addiction I think is very relevant to
what you're saying about food.

1242
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:36,920
So this theory,
the chemical hooks,

1243
00:50:36,921 --> 00:50:38,300
theory of addiction and chemical hooks
are real.

1244
00:50:38,301 --> 00:50:39,890
They're just a small part of it.
The Chemical Hooks,

1245
00:50:39,891 --> 00:50:43,580
theory of addiction comes from a series
of experiments that were done years ago.

1246
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:46,280
They're really simple.
You take a rat,

1247
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:49,280
you put it in a cage and you give it two
water bottles.

1248
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:51,860
One is just water.
The other is water laced with either

1249
00:50:51,861 --> 00:50:54,140
heroin or cocaine.
If you do that,

1250
00:50:54,141 --> 00:50:57,170
the rat will almost always prefer the
drug water and almost always die quite

1251
00:50:57,171 --> 00:50:58,640
quickly.
Right within think is a week.

1252
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,110
So there you go.
You might remember his famous

1253
00:51:00,111 --> 00:51:02,990
advertisement for from the 80s so there
you go.

1254
00:51:02,990 --> 00:51:03,830
Right?
That's our story.

1255
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,200
But in the 70s professor Alexander came
along,

1256
00:51:07,010 --> 00:51:07,880
I said,
well hang on a minute,

1257
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:12,410
you put the rat alone in an empty cage
or it's got nothing to do except use

1258
00:51:12,411 --> 00:51:14,360
these drugs.
What would happen if we did this

1259
00:51:14,361 --> 00:51:16,760
differently?
So he built a cage that he called rat

1260
00:51:16,761 --> 00:51:18,980
park,
which is basically like having verace,

1261
00:51:18,981 --> 00:51:19,790
right?
They can,

1262
00:51:19,790 --> 00:51:21,650
they've got loads of friends that can
fuck all the time.

1263
00:51:21,651 --> 00:51:25,550
They'd got a grain they like and colored
balls and they've got both the water

1264
00:51:25,551 --> 00:51:27,320
bottles,
the normal water and the drug water.

1265
00:51:27,530 --> 00:51:29,210
But the fascinating thing is in rat
park,

1266
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:31,010
they don't like the drug water that
much.

1267
00:51:31,190 --> 00:51:32,070
None of them used it.
Cut.

1268
00:51:32,090 --> 00:51:32,990
Some of it,
they do use it,

1269
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:36,080
but none of them used it compulsively
and none of them ever overdose.

1270
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:38,570
So when they deprived of the things that
make life meaningful,

1271
00:51:38,690 --> 00:51:40,100
they turn obsessive Lee to the drug.

1272
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:42,200
When they've got the things that make
life meaningful per rats,

1273
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:43,970
they don't the opposite of addiction,
isn't it?

1274
00:51:43,971 --> 00:51:46,070
Sobriety?
The opposite of addiction is connection.

1275
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:48,260
I think you can see similar principle
playing out with food,

1276
00:51:48,261 --> 00:51:49,910
right?
Of course there's some margin to the

1277
00:51:49,911 --> 00:51:51,050
individual.
I don't want to say that we're,

1278
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:55,610
we're not entirely the [inaudible] for
reasonably far away from this woman,

1279
00:51:55,690 --> 00:51:57,920
these,
these people that were on this dire

1280
00:51:57,921 --> 00:52:00,320
morphine.
So why are you saying that they don't

1281
00:52:00,321 --> 00:52:03,080
get addicted to it because they go back
to their lives meaningful.

1282
00:52:03,081 --> 00:52:05,360
There's a human example that happened at
the same time as rat park.

1283
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:09,350
Why are their lives particularly
meaningful in relationship to like the

1284
00:52:09,351 --> 00:52:12,770
lives we're talking about here?
So I think you can see in an example,

1285
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:14,900
a good example,
it was happening at the same time as rat

1286
00:52:14,901 --> 00:52:16,310
park and experiment,
the Vietnam War,

1287
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:17,060
right?

1288
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:19,160
Huge numbers of American troops in
Vietnam.

1289
00:52:19,161 --> 00:52:21,150
About 40% used heroin.
Right?

1290
00:52:21,590 --> 00:52:24,020
Um,
and if you look at the reports from the

1291
00:52:24,021 --> 00:52:25,910
time they were shitting themselves,
cause they were like,

1292
00:52:25,911 --> 00:52:27,170
my God,
when the war ends,

1293
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:30,200
we're going to have all these heroin
addicts on the streets of the United

1294
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:30,891
States.
They're going to come home.

1295
00:52:30,891 --> 00:52:33,020
And because they believe the chemical
hooks theory,

1296
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:36,830
it's a really good study in the Archives
of General Psychiatry by Professor Lee

1297
00:52:36,830 --> 00:52:39,320
Robbins that followed these guys hope,
my select group of them.

1298
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:43,580
And what it found was at 95% of them
just stopped,

1299
00:52:43,850 --> 00:52:46,520
right?
It didn't go into some catastrophic

1300
00:52:46,550 --> 00:52:47,960
withdraw.
Some of them did experience some

1301
00:52:47,961 --> 00:52:50,090
physical discomfort,
but they didn't.

1302
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:50,953
You know,
they didn't.

1303
00:52:51,470 --> 00:52:53,180
Now,
if you believe the old theory of

1304
00:52:53,181 --> 00:52:55,250
addiction that you're taken over by the
chemical hooks,

1305
00:52:55,251 --> 00:52:56,270
that makes no sense,
right?

1306
00:52:56,600 --> 00:53:00,050
But they've been exposed to all the same
chemical hooks as any homeless street,

1307
00:53:00,470 --> 00:53:02,630
street addicted person to be on the
streets.

1308
00:53:03,070 --> 00:53:05,150
Um,
but if you understand this different way

1309
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:06,170
of thinking,
it makes perfect sense.

1310
00:53:06,171 --> 00:53:10,640
If you took you and me now and put us in
a hellish pestilential jungle where we

1311
00:53:10,641 --> 00:53:12,650
don't want to be,
we could die at any moment.

1312
00:53:12,651 --> 00:53:14,930
We'd be made to kill people.
You would definitely survive longer than

1313
00:53:14,931 --> 00:53:17,570
me.
But we were both find heroin a lot more

1314
00:53:17,571 --> 00:53:18,950
appealing than we do now.
Right.

1315
00:53:19,130 --> 00:53:22,100
And then when we come back to our lives,
when we have meaning and purpose,

1316
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:24,410
we would find heroin a lot less
appealing.

1317
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:26,010
The core of addiction is not wanting

1318
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:29,160
to be present in your life because your
life is too painful place to be.

1319
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:31,830
So when something,
an intervention happens that reduces the

1320
00:53:31,831 --> 00:53:34,710
amount of pain in your life,
you could be less addicted.

1321
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:36,660
There's a very challenging,
like Marianne faithful,

1322
00:53:36,661 --> 00:53:39,060
you know the British rocks,
I was to stop you right there because

1323
00:53:39,061 --> 00:53:43,050
there is a giant issue though with
people taking pain pills after

1324
00:53:43,051 --> 00:53:45,630
operations that weren't on pain pills
before.

1325
00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:49,830
And then they get addicted to them.
So that's because a lack of meaning in

1326
00:53:49,831 --> 00:53:53,100
their life or is it because there is an
absolute real chemical hook?

1327
00:53:53,310 --> 00:53:55,350
Like,
I have a good friend who had his nose

1328
00:53:55,470 --> 00:53:59,220
broken and a,
they fixed his nose and he got on some,

1329
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:03,120
I think it was oxycontin afterwards they
prescribed to them and then four months

1330
00:54:03,121 --> 00:54:04,890
later he's taking it every day,
all day.

1331
00:54:05,130 --> 00:54:06,480
So there's a few things about that.

1332
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:07,680
Firstly,
chemical hooks are real,

1333
00:54:07,681 --> 00:54:09,900
but they're a small part of the picture.
We know how much they are.

1334
00:54:09,901 --> 00:54:12,480
So this experiments that measure this,
so we,

1335
00:54:12,481 --> 00:54:13,890
um,
lots of people want to take him.

1336
00:54:14,010 --> 00:54:15,270
In fact,
some people listening to this will be

1337
00:54:15,271 --> 00:54:18,930
taking part in this experiment.
Now when nicotine patches were invented

1338
00:54:18,931 --> 00:54:21,810
in the late eighties and they become
marketed in the early nineties,

1339
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:24,060
there's this huge wave of optimism,
right?

1340
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:26,940
Cause the chemical hook in cigarettes is
nicotine.

1341
00:54:27,570 --> 00:54:30,090
Nicotine patches give Ya the chemical
hook you're addicted to.

1342
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:32,430
Um,
and so there was this huge,

1343
00:54:32,431 --> 00:54:32,640
wait,
what?

1344
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:33,151
They're like,
great,

1345
00:54:33,151 --> 00:54:34,560
we're going to give people the camp
because it's,

1346
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:37,020
the diction is caused by chemical hooks.
We're going to give them the chemical

1347
00:54:37,021 --> 00:54:39,840
hook.
They'll stop wanting these filthy smoke

1348
00:54:40,470 --> 00:54:41,850
smoking's going to end,
right?

1349
00:54:42,310 --> 00:54:45,780
And in fact,
what happened is 17% of people,

1350
00:54:45,781 --> 00:54:47,580
according to the US surgeon general's
report,

1351
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:50,380
when they take nicotine,
use nicotine patches and they're

1352
00:54:50,381 --> 00:54:51,450
motivated,
stop smoking.

1353
00:54:51,450 --> 00:54:53,710
Right?
Really important to say 17% is not.

1354
00:54:53,730 --> 00:54:57,100
No one big number that has saved
hundreds of thousands of people's lives

1355
00:54:57,101 --> 00:55:00,480
at a conservative estimate,
but still leaves 83% where something

1356
00:55:00,481 --> 00:55:01,291
else is going on.
Right?

1357
00:55:01,291 --> 00:55:02,970
But isn't that because of the delivery
method?

1358
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,810
The digital delivery method of
cigarettes is incredibly satisfying.

1359
00:55:05,830 --> 00:55:08,340
You take a hit,
you get it right into your system and

1360
00:55:08,341 --> 00:55:09,870
boom,
you get that nicotine,

1361
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:13,230
their transdermal,
it's very slow.

1362
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:15,000
It's not the same feeling.
Yeah,

1363
00:55:15,001 --> 00:55:17,610
there are there experiments that show
there is pleasure that comes from the

1364
00:55:17,611 --> 00:55:19,650
delivery method,
but it's also about self soothing.

1365
00:55:19,651 --> 00:55:21,570
It's about anxiety.
It's about boredom.

1366
00:55:21,910 --> 00:55:23,580
Um,
and this is very important to relate to

1367
00:55:23,581 --> 00:55:26,670
the opiate crisis.
So one in 130,

1368
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:28,950
um,
opioid prescriptions resulted in

1369
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:29,813
addiction,
right?

1370
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:32,460
So it's a small number,
but at catastrophic and devastating

1371
00:55:32,461 --> 00:55:33,930
number.
And I reported from the places that have

1372
00:55:33,931 --> 00:55:37,080
been most affected like this by this
like keene in New Hampshire.

1373
00:55:37,110 --> 00:55:40,290
One in what,
one in 130 if the users become addicted.

1374
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:41,400
That's it.
Yeah.

1375
00:55:41,490 --> 00:55:45,450
It's a relatively small proportion now
that cause so many people in the country

1376
00:55:45,451 --> 00:55:46,560
wrong.
Yeah.

1377
00:55:46,561 --> 00:55:48,050
I can send you the study.
That's the,

1378
00:55:48,051 --> 00:55:51,190
the best studies that got that.
And that's in the United States or in

1379
00:55:51,191 --> 00:55:52,500
the UK,
in the United States.

1380
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:54,450
We've got,
that's one in 130 prescriptions.

1381
00:55:54,451 --> 00:55:56,820
But bear in mind that some people get
more than one prescription.

1382
00:55:56,821 --> 00:55:57,654
So,
you know,

1383
00:55:57,870 --> 00:55:58,703
but,
um,

1384
00:55:59,070 --> 00:56:00,930
the,
but one of the things that's really

1385
00:56:00,931 --> 00:56:04,590
important to understand about that is
the context in which this is happening,

1386
00:56:04,591 --> 00:56:06,260
right?
In Britain in the 18th.

1387
00:56:06,270 --> 00:56:09,360
And this totally relates to what I write
about in lost connections about

1388
00:56:09,361 --> 00:56:13,080
depression as well as in chasing the
scream about addiction in Britain in the

1389
00:56:13,081 --> 00:56:15,240
18th century,
there was this thing that happened

1390
00:56:15,241 --> 00:56:16,770
called the gin craze,
right?

1391
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:22,140
So huge numbers of people are driven out
of the countryside into these disgusting

1392
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:24,130
urban slums where,
you

1393
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:25,330
know,
they're living in this office,

1394
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:27,250
they've lost everything that made like
meaningful to them.

1395
00:56:27,251 --> 00:56:29,560
Right.
And what happened was an outbreak of

1396
00:56:29,561 --> 00:56:31,570
mass alcoholism,
huge outbreak.

1397
00:56:31,571 --> 00:56:34,750
It's called the gin craze.
There's famous paintings of like a woman

1398
00:56:34,751 --> 00:56:37,060
drinking a bottle of gin while her baby
falls out a window,

1399
00:56:37,061 --> 00:56:37,990
that kind of thing.
Right?

1400
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:41,050
And it really happened,
and at the time what people said is,

1401
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:44,620
look at this evil drug gin.
Look at what it's done to people.

1402
00:56:44,710 --> 00:56:47,920
If only we could get rid of these evil
people selling this evil drug gin,

1403
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:50,740
this problem would go away.
Now when we look back at it,

1404
00:56:50,741 --> 00:56:51,910
we know that can't have been because of
Jim,

1405
00:56:51,911 --> 00:56:54,370
because we could both have jen in these
glasses.

1406
00:56:54,371 --> 00:56:57,250
Now anyone in Britain can go and buy gin
at any point,

1407
00:56:57,251 --> 00:57:00,040
pretty much.
And if they're an adult and we don't

1408
00:57:00,041 --> 00:57:01,450
have,
I mean there's still some alcoholism.

1409
00:57:01,450 --> 00:57:03,860
Of course there was some despair.
Yeah,

1410
00:57:03,930 --> 00:57:06,430
it's caused a lot changed.
It's not the availability of the drug.

1411
00:57:06,431 --> 00:57:08,260
What changes the amount of pain in the
society.

1412
00:57:08,530 --> 00:57:11,500
And that is the key factor that's
playing out here with opioids,

1413
00:57:11,501 --> 00:57:13,000
right?
It's not the only factor.

1414
00:57:13,001 --> 00:57:14,560
Chemical Hooks are real,
but you know,

1415
00:57:14,570 --> 00:57:16,810
I'm a Brazilian guy.
He was absolutely adamant that,

1416
00:57:16,811 --> 00:57:17,950
you know,
he,

1417
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:20,380
he become medically addicted was an
accidental chemical.

1418
00:57:20,381 --> 00:57:23,020
Hooks are taken him over.
He'd been a college athlete.

1419
00:57:23,110 --> 00:57:26,080
Right.
And he was in a particular about 21 he

1420
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:28,680
was in a terrible car accident and they
get a,

1421
00:57:28,690 --> 00:57:31,090
and they gave him loads of opioids and
it became a doctor.

1422
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:31,661
But then I said,
well,

1423
00:57:31,661 --> 00:57:33,840
tell me about what's going well.
So it's going on today.

1424
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:35,230
He couldn't be a college athlete
anymore.

1425
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:38,320
It's a whole life had been built around
being an athlete and because of his

1426
00:57:38,321 --> 00:57:40,300
injuries,
he couldn't become an athlete anymore.

1427
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:41,770
And I said,
well do you think it might have been

1428
00:57:41,771 --> 00:57:45,310
related also to the despair around that?
It doesn't take long for people.

1429
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:47,800
I think part of the promise,
because we've got such stigma about

1430
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:49,060
depression,
anxiety,

1431
00:57:49,061 --> 00:57:52,120
addiction,
people will latch onto the biological

1432
00:57:52,121 --> 00:57:54,610
explanation,
whether it's the chemical imbalance

1433
00:57:54,611 --> 00:57:58,210
theory,
the chemical hooks theory as their path

1434
00:57:58,211 --> 00:57:58,991
out of stigma.
Where's,

1435
00:57:58,991 --> 00:58:00,490
to me,
you shouldn't be stigmatized in any

1436
00:58:00,491 --> 00:58:02,740
fucking circumstance,
whether it's because you're in pain,

1437
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:05,200
psychological pain,
physical pain.

1438
00:58:05,230 --> 00:58:07,420
Did you see the point I'm making?
So I think one of the reasons why we're

1439
00:58:07,421 --> 00:58:09,640
so committed to this,
and it's not even a good way out of

1440
00:58:09,641 --> 00:58:11,140
stigma.
I can explain to you happy ones are

1441
00:58:11,141 --> 00:58:13,390
interesting evidence about that,
but did you see the point?

1442
00:58:13,391 --> 00:58:14,224
I'm making job.

1443
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:17,950
I do see the point that you're making
that people with lives that are

1444
00:58:17,951 --> 00:58:22,120
unsatisfying or unfulfilling or there's
some sort of a major issue in their,

1445
00:58:22,121 --> 00:58:25,090
like the athlete that's no longer going
to be able to be an athlete,

1446
00:58:25,390 --> 00:58:29,290
that that's going to make these drugs
more enticing.

1447
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:32,170
I,
but I know too many people that have had

1448
00:58:32,171 --> 00:58:35,830
like real issues getting off of them,
like physical issues.

1449
00:58:36,030 --> 00:58:38,470
We're no one to painful for withdrawals,
of course.

1450
00:58:38,530 --> 00:58:41,110
And most people,
I mean you're talking about the same

1451
00:58:41,111 --> 00:58:43,810
people that have a hard time not eating
shitty food,

1452
00:58:43,811 --> 00:58:46,390
right?
They have people that have a hard time

1453
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:48,520
getting disciplined enough to go to the
gym.

1454
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,610
These are the same kind of people we're
talking about.

1455
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:55,720
They're going to have a massive problem.
If you give them pills and those pills

1456
00:58:55,721 --> 00:58:59,050
create a chemical hook,
even if it's a chemical hook that you or

1457
00:58:59,051 --> 00:59:02,020
I or a discipline person would be able
to get.

1458
00:59:02,021 --> 00:59:04,930
Like Dr. Carl Hart famously called it,
he said,

1459
00:59:04,931 --> 00:59:06,580
it's like getting over the flu.
He goes,

1460
00:59:06,581 --> 00:59:08,500
that's what heroin is like.
Everyone wants to pretend that you're

1461
00:59:08,501 --> 00:59:09,131
going to die.
He goes,

1462
00:59:09,131 --> 00:59:10,750
no,
you feel like shit for a little while

1463
00:59:10,870 --> 00:59:12,160
and then you're fine.
He goes,

1464
00:59:12,161 --> 00:59:15,310
it's not the thing that everybody makes
it out to be withdrawals or not the

1465
00:59:15,311 --> 00:59:16,720
thing that everybody makes it out to be,
but,

1466
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:21,410
but if you have the average person and
you give them pills and those pills can

1467
00:59:21,411 --> 00:59:22,010
keep them

1468
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:24,830
from getting the flu,
they're going to keep taking those

1469
00:59:24,831 --> 00:59:26,540
pills.
And if they stop taking those pills,

1470
00:59:26,541 --> 00:59:28,580
they get the flu.
People are comfort,

1471
00:59:28,581 --> 00:59:31,850
jumpy junkies,
and I think it's does too simplistic.

1472
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:32,990
I think there's some truth in what
you're saying,

1473
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:37,190
but I think the key thing that happens,
so I think doctor to is t who's a friend

1474
00:59:37,191 --> 00:59:38,380
of mine is totally right,
but the,

1475
00:59:38,381 --> 00:59:41,510
the,
the physical withdrawal is,

1476
00:59:41,570 --> 00:59:43,040
you know,
a flu is not a nice thing,

1477
00:59:43,041 --> 00:59:44,660
but it's not the most onerous thing in
the world.

1478
00:59:44,990 --> 00:59:48,530
But the thing that's really devastating
is the resumption of the pain that you

1479
00:59:48,531 --> 00:59:50,150
were in east,
that psychological pain that you were

1480
00:59:50,151 --> 00:59:51,950
nice.
The timing with the drug,

1481
00:59:51,951 --> 00:59:52,690
right?
Right.

1482
00:59:52,690 --> 00:59:55,070
Do you want to understand why people are
taking so many painkillers?

1483
00:59:55,071 --> 00:59:56,870
We've got to understand why they're in
so much pain.

1484
00:59:57,080 --> 01:00:00,040
And that comes back to the nine causes
of depression and anxiety that arrived

1485
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:03,230
in las connections and then the kind of
seven solutions to this problem that I

1486
01:00:03,231 --> 01:00:03,980
offer.

1487
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:05,900
So again,
that's about if are,

1488
01:00:05,990 --> 01:00:07,820
so let's say Joe,
right?

1489
01:00:07,850 --> 01:00:09,680
Joe In the paint store who I was talking
about,

1490
01:00:09,681 --> 01:00:10,514
who's,
you know,

1491
01:00:10,580 --> 01:00:15,580
he who has this job he can't bear,
has very little a meaning in his life,

1492
01:00:15,621 --> 01:00:17,540
feels his life is just slipping through
his fingers.

1493
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:20,690
He took oxy for quite a long time.
He actually contacted me because of my,

1494
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:22,250
my book.
Um,

1495
01:00:22,340 --> 01:00:23,011
and because,
and,

1496
01:00:23,011 --> 01:00:25,730
and my ted talk,
and he thought he was telling me a story

1497
01:00:25,731 --> 01:00:26,630
about addiction.
Right?

1498
01:00:26,631 --> 01:00:29,300
But the truth is when he took oxygen,
he was numbed.

1499
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:33,140
It made him as numb as the work itself.
And then when he stopped,

1500
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:34,880
he was acutely depressed and felt like
shit.

1501
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:38,510
So I think the challenges,
if you are coming off of this drug into

1502
01:00:38,511 --> 01:00:42,230
a society of profoundly lonely and
isolated people who are financially

1503
01:00:42,231 --> 01:00:45,500
insecure,
who've been told that life is about

1504
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:47,600
money and status,
who,

1505
01:00:47,630 --> 01:00:48,463
who,
you know,

1506
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:50,120
who,
who think life is about screaming at

1507
01:00:50,121 --> 01:00:53,300
each other three screens,
a lot of those people are gonna feel

1508
01:00:53,301 --> 01:00:54,020
like shit.

1509
01:00:54,020 --> 01:00:55,910
And it's not because they're
individually week,

1510
01:00:55,970 --> 01:00:57,890
right?
It's become that and maybe individual

1511
01:00:57,891 --> 01:00:58,521
witnesses.
Of course,

1512
01:00:58,521 --> 01:01:00,590
we all have flaws.
Every human being has flaws.

1513
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:06,060
But I think it's much more because the
fact that it's risen so much tells you

1514
01:01:06,291 --> 01:01:08,600
that it's a response to social changes.
Right?

1515
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:11,540
Just like the fact that obesity has
risen so much tells us now there are

1516
01:01:11,590 --> 01:01:14,480
course individual agency.
I don't want to infantilize anyone that

1517
01:01:14,481 --> 01:01:17,430
are things individuals can do obviously.
And I talk about them a lot in lots

1518
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:20,030
connections.
But I think the fact that it's a social

1519
01:01:20,210 --> 01:01:22,100
transformation,
um,

1520
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:24,110
does tell you something,
there's a,

1521
01:01:24,150 --> 01:01:26,810
a good illustration of this kind of
weird thing that was discovered about

1522
01:01:26,811 --> 01:01:31,010
depression in the 70s that was so
inconvenient that psychiatrist tried to

1523
01:01:31,011 --> 01:01:33,470
brush it under the carpet.
So in the 70s,

1524
01:01:33,471 --> 01:01:36,110
the American Psychiatric Association for
the first time,

1525
01:01:36,310 --> 01:01:40,190
what it to standardize how depression is
diagnosed across the u s because up to

1526
01:01:40,191 --> 01:01:43,100
then doctors were just using their own
judgment about what it even was.

1527
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:46,490
Right?
So they drew up a list of 10 symptoms,

1528
01:01:46,491 --> 01:01:49,850
kind of obvious things like feeling
worthless cry and a lot,

1529
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:51,230
you know,
you could guess where they were.

1530
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:55,550
And they send this out to doctors all
over the US and uh,

1531
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,370
they use it but a cup of,
within a couple of months.

1532
01:01:58,550 --> 01:01:59,600
Dot.
To start to come back and go,

1533
01:01:59,601 --> 01:02:00,434
look,
we've got a real,

1534
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:04,160
we've got a problem here.
Because if we just use this checklist,

1535
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:07,970
we should be diagnosing every grieving
person is mentally ill because these are

1536
01:02:07,971 --> 01:02:09,260
the symptoms of grief,
right?

1537
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:10,850
Everyone,
when you lose someone,

1538
01:02:11,510 --> 01:02:13,250
Cope wants to cry a lot,
fit,

1539
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:15,410
you know,
has persistent feelings of sadness,

1540
01:02:15,411 --> 01:02:17,390
that kind of thing.
So like what do we do?

1541
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:19,320
So the psychiatrist regrouped and were
like,

1542
01:02:19,321 --> 01:02:20,970
okay,
we'll create something.

1543
01:02:20,971 --> 01:02:23,640
It was called the grief exception.
Basically sad.

1544
01:02:23,790 --> 01:02:27,390
Use this checklist to diagnose
depression unless the person has lost

1545
01:02:27,391 --> 01:02:30,330
someone they love in the last year,
in which case none of this counts.

1546
01:02:30,450 --> 01:02:32,760
So they start using that.
But over the next few years that

1547
01:02:32,761 --> 01:02:34,380
followed this,
this really awkward debate,

1548
01:02:34,381 --> 01:02:35,220
cause they're like,
wait a minute,

1549
01:02:35,670 --> 01:02:39,630
we're being told to tell our patients
that depression is just a brain disease.

1550
01:02:39,750 --> 01:02:41,910
That you can just identify from a
checklist.

1551
01:02:42,690 --> 01:02:46,830
Unless there's one situation in life
where it's perfectly legitimate to react

1552
01:02:46,831 --> 01:02:48,390
this way.
But at that begs the question,

1553
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:51,270
why is that?
Why not?

1554
01:02:51,630 --> 01:02:53,010
If you made homeless,
why not?

1555
01:02:53,011 --> 01:02:54,660
If you'd stuck in a shitty job,
you hey,

1556
01:02:54,870 --> 01:02:56,190
why not?
If you're really lonely,

1557
01:02:56,340 --> 01:03:00,210
the minute you admit all that,
you have to admit context and that was

1558
01:03:00,211 --> 01:03:02,190
so inconvenient.
They just got rid of the grief exception

1559
01:03:02,191 --> 01:03:05,820
that doesn't exist.
A fascinating fact and that seems to be

1560
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:10,320
a huge issue.
That seems to be one of the primary

1561
01:03:10,321 --> 01:03:13,290
reasons why people today.
I mean if you,

1562
01:03:13,291 --> 01:03:17,670
if you stop and ask the average person
today who's not feeling well,

1563
01:03:18,180 --> 01:03:21,720
I guarantee you they're going to be able
to come up with at least one or two of

1564
01:03:21,721 --> 01:03:26,721
those things on the list that are,
that are factors who totally right and

1565
01:03:27,811 --> 01:03:28,020
is there.

1566
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:30,360
It's a job or financial stress,
relationship,

1567
01:03:30,361 --> 01:03:32,070
stress,
loneliness,

1568
01:03:32,130 --> 01:03:36,810
friendship issues or death in the family
or losing someone they love,

1569
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:38,960
but the fact that losing someone their
love like,

1570
01:03:38,961 --> 01:03:40,140
Oh,
we'll count that.

1571
01:03:40,780 --> 01:03:44,010
That's the one thing that's seems very
preposterous.

1572
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:47,210
And the woman who did the most research,
and this is one of the best people I've

1573
01:03:47,211 --> 01:03:49,730
got to know for loss connections when we
could talk to Joanne [inaudible],

1574
01:03:49,731 --> 01:03:53,310
he's an amazing person.
She lost her baby in childbirth.

1575
01:03:53,710 --> 01:03:57,000
Babies called Cheyenne and she became an
expert on this and she said,

1576
01:03:57,030 --> 01:03:58,830
you know,
she talks about the craziness of this.

1577
01:03:58,831 --> 01:04:01,260
It just shows we don't understand pain
in this society.

1578
01:04:01,590 --> 01:04:02,160
Great.
She said,

1579
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:03,720
she put it to me.
We don't,

1580
01:04:03,750 --> 01:04:05,700
grief isn't a pathology,
right?

1581
01:04:05,910 --> 01:04:07,650
We don't need cheap.
She's done this research that shows,

1582
01:04:07,651 --> 01:04:11,850
I think the figure is 32% of grieving
parents are diagnosed and drugs in the

1583
01:04:11,851 --> 01:04:14,560
first 48 hours after their child dies
and she's,

1584
01:04:14,570 --> 01:04:15,810
this is a sickness,
right?

1585
01:04:16,050 --> 01:04:20,280
That that grief is not a pathology.
We grieve because we've loved someone,

1586
01:04:20,281 --> 01:04:21,840
right?
It's not a malfunction.

1587
01:04:21,841 --> 01:04:24,990
It's not sign of madness.
It's a sign that you loved the person

1588
01:04:25,170 --> 01:04:26,940
and the way I'm going to be on what she
says now,

1589
01:04:26,970 --> 01:04:30,660
but you know,
I think one of the things,

1590
01:04:30,690 --> 01:04:33,240
the fact that the depression and grief
had the same symptoms is really

1591
01:04:33,241 --> 01:04:36,840
significant because I think depression
is grief for your own life,

1592
01:04:36,841 --> 01:04:38,430
not going how it should,
right?

1593
01:04:38,670 --> 01:04:40,740
It's grief for your own needs not being
met.

1594
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:45,300
Now when someone we love dies or we can
do is hold the survivors and love them,

1595
01:04:45,301 --> 01:04:46,420
right?
But with,

1596
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:48,240
um,
but with,

1597
01:04:48,330 --> 01:04:51,630
um,
with your own needs not being met,

1598
01:04:51,631 --> 01:04:52,620
I mean,
a really interesting sample or there's

1599
01:04:52,621 --> 01:04:53,940
something you've kept brilliantly on the
show,

1600
01:04:53,941 --> 01:04:56,280
joe about psychedelics.
I'm the researcher on Psychedelics,

1601
01:04:56,281 --> 01:04:58,620
which taught me a lot about how we might
think about this differently.

1602
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:00,060
So as you know,
uh,

1603
01:05:00,061 --> 01:05:03,840
you know better than anyone the,
until the mid sixties loads of research

1604
01:05:03,841 --> 01:05:07,470
was done giving Lsd to people with
depression,

1605
01:05:07,530 --> 01:05:08,790
alcoholism,
both problems.

1606
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,280
They weren't done to the standards.
We want to do scientific experiments

1607
01:05:11,281 --> 01:05:13,260
now,
but they found really promising results

1608
01:05:13,261 --> 01:05:15,240
and then Nixon shuts the whole thing
down.

1609
01:05:15,241 --> 01:05:16,740
Right.
In the last six years,

1610
01:05:16,741 --> 01:05:19,660
there's been a huge reawakening this,
I went and interviewed blas connections,

1611
01:05:19,661 --> 01:05:22,360
the teams that have worked on this in
um,

1612
01:05:23,140 --> 01:05:25,810
uh,
here in la at Ucla,

1613
01:05:25,810 --> 01:05:27,250
Nyu at Johns Hopkins,
in Baltimore,

1614
01:05:27,460 --> 01:05:28,720
in London,
at Ucl,

1615
01:05:29,010 --> 01:05:30,910
uh,
in Sao Paolo and in Norway.

1616
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:33,250
And loads of fascinating things and in
fact about this.

1617
01:05:33,251 --> 01:05:35,800
But there's one that I think really
relates to our conversation powerfully.

1618
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:37,200
Um,
w well,

1619
01:05:37,210 --> 01:05:38,920
loads of things,
but we'll talk about one.

1620
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:42,070
Um,
so there was a sub finding a,

1621
01:05:42,071 --> 01:05:43,990
one of the studies that I became
obsessed with,

1622
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:46,540
they did this research at Johns Hopkins
in Baltimore,

1623
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:50,590
some of the leading scientists in the
world where they gave psilocybin the

1624
01:05:50,650 --> 01:05:54,280
active component in magic mushrooms to
um,

1625
01:05:55,150 --> 01:05:59,410
chronic longterm smokers who tried
everything to stop smoking and had not

1626
01:05:59,411 --> 01:05:59,920
succeeded.

1627
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:01,240
Right.
I've thought about my mother a lot

1628
01:06:01,241 --> 01:06:04,360
because my mother is a chain smoker.
This is a photograph of me and her when

1629
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:06,580
I'm six months old,
she's breastfeeding me smoking and

1630
01:06:06,581 --> 01:06:09,370
resting the ashtray on my stomach.
Oh my God.

1631
01:06:09,660 --> 01:06:10,493
Uh,
and,

1632
01:06:10,630 --> 01:06:12,160
and so they take people like my mother,
right.

1633
01:06:12,220 --> 01:06:13,450
I'd already,
when I showed her that picture,

1634
01:06:13,451 --> 01:06:14,770
she said you were fucking difficult
baby.

1635
01:06:14,771 --> 01:06:18,490
I needed that cigarette.
It's a how they try to blame you when I

1636
01:06:18,491 --> 01:06:21,010
was a fucking baby.
She,

1637
01:06:21,850 --> 01:06:23,190
she's a good person,
but the,

1638
01:06:23,410 --> 01:06:24,071
the,
the,

1639
01:06:24,071 --> 01:06:27,280
so they take these people quite a
longtime smokers and they gave them

1640
01:06:27,281 --> 01:06:31,510
three doses of psilocybin over,
think it was six months.

1641
01:06:31,530 --> 01:06:33,710
It was six months.
So two month intervals of thing.

1642
01:06:34,270 --> 01:06:38,170
And what they found was extraordinary.
80% of them stop smoking.

1643
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:39,940
Right?
And it still remained not smoking more

1644
01:06:39,941 --> 01:06:40,840
than two years later.

1645
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:41,830
Incredible.
Think about,

1646
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:44,830
we were comparing it to 17% but nicotine
patches and they were like,

1647
01:06:44,831 --> 01:06:47,250
what's going on?
So they did all this research in this.

1648
01:06:47,260 --> 01:06:50,470
And what we've gotta be careful with
psychedelics is to not talk about it the

1649
01:06:50,471 --> 01:06:53,290
way we were misleadingly told about
antidepressants,

1650
01:06:53,291 --> 01:06:54,850
chemical anti depressants in the 90s,
which is,

1651
01:06:55,050 --> 01:06:56,530
oh,
it flips the chemical switch in your

1652
01:06:56,531 --> 01:06:58,570
brain.
Clearly a chemical process happens in

1653
01:06:58,571 --> 01:06:59,110
the brain,
but,

1654
01:06:59,110 --> 01:07:01,690
but what they found,
I think the most important thing and the

1655
01:07:01,691 --> 01:07:05,830
lesson for people who don't want to use
psychedelics as well is a sub finding.

1656
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:09,040
So if you take,
if you take psilocybin,

1657
01:07:09,340 --> 01:07:12,400
most people will have a kind of
spiritual experience,

1658
01:07:12,401 --> 01:07:13,750
right?
Um,

1659
01:07:14,740 --> 01:07:17,380
some people will have a super intense
spiritual experience that people have in

1660
01:07:17,390 --> 01:07:20,170
Melbourne and a minority will have no
spiritual experience.

1661
01:07:20,530 --> 01:07:23,740
It turns out the positive effects,
like reduction in depression and

1662
01:07:23,741 --> 01:07:28,741
addiction correlate exactly with the
intensity of the spiritual experience.

1663
01:07:28,910 --> 01:07:31,030
So if you have no spiritual experience,
you don't have,

1664
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:33,340
but here's isn't is dose dependent?
No,

1665
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:36,280
this cut across those.
So they gave him three varying doses,

1666
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:37,960
doses,
I can't remember,

1667
01:07:37,961 --> 01:07:39,620
but it's in the,
it's pretty significant though.

1668
01:07:39,621 --> 01:07:40,980
That's a very important factor.
Yeah.

1669
01:07:40,981 --> 01:07:44,550
So across the three,
so you were given it three times and you

1670
01:07:44,590 --> 01:07:47,310
always given three different doses,
so obviously you would have more.

1671
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:49,720
Most people have much more intense
experience with the most,

1672
01:07:49,780 --> 01:07:51,440
with the strongest dose,
but the,

1673
01:07:51,441 --> 01:07:55,450
the key thing I think about that,
that finding is that

1674
01:07:56,980 --> 01:08:00,310
one of the experts put it to me.
It's not that it's a chemical process,

1675
01:08:00,311 --> 01:08:02,770
it's a learning experience.
What it does is it gives you an

1676
01:08:02,771 --> 01:08:06,490
experience of what it can feel like to
be deeply connected,

1677
01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:08,590
to feel deeply connected to the people
around you,

1678
01:08:08,591 --> 01:08:10,210
to the natural world.
Incredible,

1679
01:08:10,211 --> 01:08:11,830
strong,
natural antidepressant that we can talk

1680
01:08:11,831 --> 01:08:14,630
about if you want.
Have you psychedelic experience?

1681
01:08:14,830 --> 01:08:17,860
When was a teenager?
I bought some and I think they were a

1682
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:19,460
drug dealer in Canada.
Tam Market.

1683
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:22,100
I'm holding off because I've got to go
to the Amazon rainforest later this year

1684
01:08:22,101 --> 01:08:24,710
and I want to use Iowasca for the first
time in the Amazon.

1685
01:08:24,740 --> 01:08:27,560
Never had,
cause you know I'm getting that from the

1686
01:08:27,561 --> 01:08:28,910
way you're describing it.
It's interesting.

1687
01:08:28,911 --> 01:08:30,380
I interviewed huge numbers of people who
had,

1688
01:08:30,410 --> 01:08:31,610
tell me what you're,
what you're getting.

1689
01:08:31,611 --> 01:08:32,200
That's interesting.

1690
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:36,700
Well this the what it is is a dissolving
of the ego.

1691
01:08:36,730 --> 01:08:41,050
That's a general factor that almost
everybody reports.

1692
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:45,280
Um,
it also releases you from deeply

1693
01:08:45,281 --> 01:08:48,230
ingrained patterns of behavior and
thinking and,

1694
01:08:48,231 --> 01:08:51,310
and highlights them.
So as much as it is a spiritual

1695
01:08:51,311 --> 01:08:53,560
experience,
it's also a dissolving of the self.

1696
01:08:53,561 --> 01:08:54,394
And the,
the,

1697
01:08:54,810 --> 01:08:58,210
the way we define ourselves is
oftentimes very limiting.

1698
01:08:58,540 --> 01:09:01,390
You have this,
this is the way I describe it and this

1699
01:09:01,391 --> 01:09:05,560
is the way I described very powerful
psychedelic experiences.

1700
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:07,720
It's like,
do you remember the old windows thing?

1701
01:09:07,721 --> 01:09:08,410
Control,
alt,

1702
01:09:08,410 --> 01:09:10,060
delete.
That's how you'd reboot.

1703
01:09:10,900 --> 01:09:12,280
It's like control,
alt,

1704
01:09:12,310 --> 01:09:17,170
delete for your brain and your brain
reboots with a fresh new desktop.

1705
01:09:17,230 --> 01:09:21,370
There's nothing on it except one folder.
And that one to folder is titled My old

1706
01:09:21,371 --> 01:09:23,470
bullshit.
And you have two choices.

1707
01:09:23,471 --> 01:09:27,430
You can either start fresh and try to re
examine the world with fresh eyes or

1708
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:32,110
what's more convenient as you slowly
slipped into the my old bullshit folder

1709
01:09:32,350 --> 01:09:35,920
and start opening it up and repeating
patterns in lighting that cigarette up

1710
01:09:35,921 --> 01:09:38,620
when you really shouldn't.
Having that drink when you probably

1711
01:09:38,621 --> 01:09:42,820
shouldn't do that either.
And those things are common because it's

1712
01:09:42,821 --> 01:09:44,920
comforting.
It's comforting for people to repeat

1713
01:09:44,921 --> 01:09:46,240
patterns that they're familiar with.

1714
01:09:46,450 --> 01:09:48,640
I think it's a few things in that you're
totally right and the scientific

1715
01:09:48,641 --> 01:09:49,830
evidence is overwhelming.
In fact,

1716
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:51,460
at Ucl,
University College,

1717
01:09:51,461 --> 01:09:53,470
London,
Professor David Nutt did all this

1718
01:09:53,471 --> 01:09:56,440
research that shows it.
One of the things that happens in your

1719
01:09:56,441 --> 01:09:59,620
brain when you take psychedelics is the
part of the brain that relates to ego

1720
01:09:59,621 --> 01:10:02,260
just doesn't function right and then be
interviewing.

1721
01:10:02,530 --> 01:10:05,800
One of the most moving into I did was a
guy called mark who was in one of the

1722
01:10:05,830 --> 01:10:08,360
studies in Baltimore who,
um,

1723
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:13,560
was a very shy,
reserved shutdown guy when he was 10 his

1724
01:10:13,781 --> 01:10:17,560
dad had died and no one had talked to
him about his dad's death.

1725
01:10:17,561 --> 01:10:21,130
His mother was just totally devastated
and no one had talked to him about it

1726
01:10:21,820 --> 01:10:24,850
and he'd always been very shut down.
And he takes the psilocybin and he had

1727
01:10:24,851 --> 01:10:28,600
this really intense experience where he,
he thinks he's in space and he believed

1728
01:10:28,601 --> 01:10:33,601
he met his father and his father
apologized for leaving him.

1729
01:10:33,790 --> 01:10:38,530
And then he reached into mark and he
pulled out these walls and he said,

1730
01:10:38,890 --> 01:10:41,230
I want to thank these walls.
They've protected my son.

1731
01:10:41,290 --> 01:10:43,450
They've done a good job,
but you can let them go now.

1732
01:10:44,170 --> 01:10:46,710
And after that mark really changed how
he lived there.

1733
01:10:46,711 --> 01:10:49,180
She went,
she said he was able to sustain that

1734
01:10:49,181 --> 01:10:50,890
insight.
He went and learned a lot of meditation.

1735
01:10:51,310 --> 01:10:52,450
Um,
I think,

1736
01:10:52,451 --> 01:10:52,991
I think you're,
you're,

1737
01:10:52,991 --> 01:10:55,870
you're absolutely right.
It's about dissolving the ego and what

1738
01:10:55,871 --> 01:11:00,871
an experience of Eagles egolessness can
do is almost point a direction on a

1739
01:11:02,981 --> 01:11:03,940
compass.
Right.

1740
01:11:04,210 --> 01:11:07,060
But there's another aspect that emerged
in that,

1741
01:11:07,061 --> 01:11:09,010
which I think is one of the slight
differences between us.

1742
01:11:09,190 --> 01:11:09,710
I like the,
I,

1743
01:11:09,710 --> 01:11:11,200
I think there's a lot in what you're
saying.

1744
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:12,910
So in the,
in London,

1745
01:11:12,911 --> 01:11:14,100
they,
this research with chronically

1746
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:16,710
depressed people.
And Robin Carhart Harris,

1747
01:11:16,711 --> 01:11:18,120
he led that study.
He said to me,

1748
01:11:18,121 --> 01:11:21,090
you know,
there's one woman chronically depressed,

1749
01:11:21,091 --> 01:11:23,190
she takes the Psilocybin,
she gets everything you're saying,

1750
01:11:23,191 --> 01:11:25,890
the dissolution of ego,
the need for all the things you're

1751
01:11:25,891 --> 01:11:29,100
talking about.
And then she goes back to her job in a

1752
01:11:29,101 --> 01:11:33,150
shitty seaside town where you just can't
live compatible with those insights.

1753
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:34,650
Right.
She just couldn't.

1754
01:11:34,830 --> 01:11:36,930
And so her depression came back.
So to me,

1755
01:11:36,931 --> 01:11:39,000
what the size of it,
where individuals can change the lives.

1756
01:11:39,060 --> 01:11:40,110
Obviously they should.
Right.

1757
01:11:40,111 --> 01:11:43,050
And we would totally agree on that.
And a lot of people do have more margin

1758
01:11:43,051 --> 01:11:46,200
to change their lives and they think,
and we're in total agreement on that.

1759
01:11:46,770 --> 01:11:50,070
And I think you would probably agree
that there are some people who are,

1760
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:52,680
you know,
through no fault of their own,

1761
01:11:52,890 --> 01:11:55,800
like a lot of my relatives fucking
stock,

1762
01:11:55,830 --> 01:11:56,280
right?

1763
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:59,640
And then the very people will have no
margin of change.

1764
01:11:59,670 --> 01:12:01,770
But a lot of people have such a small
margin to change,

1765
01:12:02,010 --> 01:12:05,340
but that margin will not carry them out
of depression or anxiety or addiction.

1766
01:12:05,341 --> 01:12:09,240
And that's why we need the widest is
what the World Health Organization says.

1767
01:12:09,241 --> 01:12:11,970
You need social solutions as well as
individual solutions.

1768
01:12:12,150 --> 01:12:16,980
When to change the way the society works
in all sorts of ways that reduce the

1769
01:12:16,981 --> 01:12:19,080
things that are causing this pain in the
first place.

1770
01:12:19,081 --> 01:12:21,570
Do you see what I mean?
Changing the way society works though is

1771
01:12:21,571 --> 01:12:25,680
a grand in,
in tangled,

1772
01:12:25,740 --> 01:12:30,440
gigantic undertaking.
Whereas changing your own life is not so

1773
01:12:30,441 --> 01:12:32,700
actually doing your own life is
difficult.

1774
01:12:33,270 --> 01:12:35,160
It can be very difficult for a lot of
people,

1775
01:12:35,161 --> 01:12:38,250
but it's far easier than changing
society.

1776
01:12:38,370 --> 01:12:41,400
I understand what you're saying.
Who you're telling me has the

1777
01:12:41,401 --> 01:12:45,120
psychedelic experience experiences this
dissolving of ego,

1778
01:12:45,121 --> 01:12:49,290
this beautiful spiritual awakening,
but then goes back to a job that's like

1779
01:12:49,291 --> 01:12:51,330
opening up the folder of mild bullshit.

1780
01:12:51,330 --> 01:12:53,820
It's the same thing.
She's going back to the same patterns.

1781
01:12:53,850 --> 01:12:56,600
Well I would say she's being forced into
that folder cause she's what she gonna

1782
01:12:56,620 --> 01:12:57,850
do,
but lean,

1783
01:12:57,930 --> 01:13:00,210
what she's going to do is what a lot of
people do.

1784
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:02,040
I mean a lot of people change their
lives.

1785
01:13:02,070 --> 01:13:04,980
I mean it's not impossible to do.
I don't know if this woman had kids.

1786
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:07,240
I didn't ask it.
Well,

1787
01:13:07,260 --> 01:13:09,430
imagine being,
even can't imagine people being stuck

1788
01:13:09,630 --> 01:13:11,460
big.
We makes it very difficult.

1789
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:13,800
It makes it very difficult.
But she's not in jail.

1790
01:13:13,890 --> 01:13:15,480
She's not a president.
At some point you're making.

1791
01:13:15,481 --> 01:13:18,720
But I think actually,
and this might sound strange in some

1792
01:13:18,721 --> 01:13:21,420
ways,
I think changing the society is easier

1793
01:13:21,421 --> 01:13:23,230
than isolated individuals changing
their,

1794
01:13:23,330 --> 01:13:24,870
so I'll give you an exam.
How is that possible?

1795
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:25,481
Well,
I'll give you some,

1796
01:13:25,481 --> 01:13:26,314
but I'm gay,
right?

1797
01:13:26,670 --> 01:13:29,370
Um,
if I think about the incredible

1798
01:13:29,371 --> 01:13:30,600
transformation I've seen in my life.

1799
01:13:30,620 --> 01:13:33,810
So I tell the story in Los Connections
about my friend Andrew Sullivan,

1800
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:35,040
right?
1994,

1801
01:13:35,580 --> 01:13:38,580
Andrew was diagnosed with HIV.
His first thought was,

1802
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:40,010
I deserve this,
right?

1803
01:13:40,011 --> 01:13:42,180
He'd been raised in such a homophobic
world.

1804
01:13:42,390 --> 01:13:43,141
He thought,
you know what?

1805
01:13:43,141 --> 01:13:45,780
I deserve to have this,
this illness.

1806
01:13:45,781 --> 01:13:48,060
It's going to kill me.
He was watching his friends die all

1807
01:13:48,061 --> 01:13:50,040
around him.
He thought it was about to die.

1808
01:13:50,041 --> 01:13:53,310
This is before protease inhibitors and
it goes to province town,

1809
01:13:53,610 --> 01:13:57,420
little town in Cape Cod to do what he
thought would be the last thing he would

1810
01:13:57,480 --> 01:13:58,560
ever do.
Right?

1811
01:13:58,980 --> 01:14:01,890
And he wrote a book about crazy Utopian
idea that he thought,

1812
01:14:02,010 --> 01:14:04,590
this is never going to happen.
I'm never going to live to see this.

1813
01:14:04,591 --> 01:14:06,180
But maybe generations from now,
this is what happened.

1814
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:08,580
It was the first book ever arguing for
gay marriage.

1815
01:14:08,670 --> 01:14:10,500
Right?
And if I get depressed about this,

1816
01:14:10,510 --> 01:14:12,280
try to imagine going in time and saying
to Andrew,

1817
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:12,770
okay,
noted.

1818
01:14:12,770 --> 01:14:13,320
I've,
okay,

1819
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:15,820
I've got some good news.
25 years from now,

1820
01:14:16,210 --> 01:14:18,580
you're going to be alive.
But that's not the good news.

1821
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:22,300
The Supreme Court of the United States
is going to quote this book in their

1822
01:14:22,301 --> 01:14:25,360
ruling,
making it mandatory for all states in

1823
01:14:25,361 --> 01:14:26,890
the United States to introduce gay
marriage.

1824
01:14:26,891 --> 01:14:28,780
And the next day you'll be invited to
the White House,

1825
01:14:28,930 --> 01:14:32,410
which will be lit up in the colors of
the rainbow flag to celebrate with the

1826
01:14:32,411 --> 01:14:33,250
president.
And by the way,

1827
01:14:33,251 --> 01:14:35,740
that president is going to be black,
right?

1828
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:38,020
That would have sounded like ridiculous
science fiction.

1829
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:40,240
Now imagine saying to gay people 50
years ago,

1830
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:43,330
you're not going to change the society.
That's way too hard.

1831
01:14:43,540 --> 01:14:45,670
When you can do is focus on changing
yourself.

1832
01:14:46,070 --> 01:14:48,190
Actually,
gay people would be really fucking

1833
01:14:48,191 --> 01:14:50,020
miserable if that's what they'd done,
right?

1834
01:14:50,260 --> 01:14:53,890
If that's how it was,
my life will be immeasurably worse if

1835
01:14:53,891 --> 01:14:55,120
gay people are just said,
you know what?

1836
01:14:55,170 --> 01:14:57,610
It's so hard to change society.
Let's change ourselves.

1837
01:14:57,611 --> 01:15:02,611
We would've remained trapped in Shitty,
awful institutions and systems that kept

1838
01:15:02,921 --> 01:15:04,720
us down.
I actually think,

1839
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:06,640
if I think about most of the people I
know who are depressed,

1840
01:15:07,060 --> 01:15:08,940
to be honest,
their margin for individual changes

1841
01:15:08,950 --> 01:15:10,720
limited,
but banding together,

1842
01:15:10,721 --> 01:15:13,090
their margin for change is huge,
right?

1843
01:15:13,250 --> 01:15:15,790
It's thinking about which was about the
universal basic income for example.

1844
01:15:15,791 --> 01:15:16,930
Right?
Massively.

1845
01:15:16,931 --> 01:15:18,610
We're getting,
we're going to another subject here,

1846
01:15:18,740 --> 01:15:21,540
so she'd gone.
Then it's you.

1847
01:15:21,790 --> 01:15:24,140
You keep going on one to the next,

1848
01:15:25,350 --> 01:15:28,920
shut up with one.
It's far easier to explain to one

1849
01:15:28,921 --> 01:15:32,280
person,
one life why it's wrong to be homophobic

1850
01:15:32,281 --> 01:15:36,480
than it is to change all the rednecks
and all the ignorant people who don't

1851
01:15:36,481 --> 01:15:40,590
read and all the people that have deeply
ingrained archaic religious ideas about

1852
01:15:40,591 --> 01:15:45,330
homosexuality.
It's far easier to educate and luminate

1853
01:15:45,331 --> 01:15:49,290
one person and it also can be done with
the aid of psychedelics,

1854
01:15:49,470 --> 01:15:52,470
especially MTMA therapy.
This one of the things that maps is

1855
01:15:52,471 --> 01:15:55,260
doing right now with Mtma therapy and
they're,

1856
01:15:55,770 --> 01:15:58,350
they're involved in a bunch of clinical
trials right now,

1857
01:15:58,950 --> 01:16:02,910
helping people to all sorts of traumatic
stress experiences,

1858
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,980
soldiers,
people that experienced physical

1859
01:16:04,981 --> 01:16:06,540
violence,
all these people that are,

1860
01:16:06,580 --> 01:16:09,780
it's helping them alleviate a lot of the
problems that are life.

1861
01:16:10,220 --> 01:16:15,220
There's patterns that people are that
they have in their mind that they can

1862
01:16:15,271 --> 01:16:16,530
release.
Sure,

1863
01:16:16,590 --> 01:16:19,670
you could release and you can be
educated and you can understand.

1864
01:16:19,690 --> 01:16:22,020
You can change and grow as an
individual.

1865
01:16:22,021 --> 01:16:24,960
It's far easier to do that with one
person,

1866
01:16:25,110 --> 01:16:28,290
for one person to change their life.
Then it changed an entire culture.

1867
01:16:28,291 --> 01:16:32,010
I do agree that there have been great
strides in this country when it comes to

1868
01:16:32,011 --> 01:16:33,750
discrimination,
when it comes to racism,

1869
01:16:33,751 --> 01:16:35,820
when it comes to so many different
ideas.

1870
01:16:35,950 --> 01:16:39,720
But I think that's connected to the
exchange of ideas that we're

1871
01:16:39,721 --> 01:16:41,460
experiencing now because of the
Internet.

1872
01:16:41,700 --> 01:16:44,760
I think because of the fact that there's
so many different arguments back and

1873
01:16:44,761 --> 01:16:48,780
forth and there's so many different ways
to approach things that people are being

1874
01:16:48,781 --> 01:16:53,190
forced to change their opinions.
Even more religious people today or more

1875
01:16:53,191 --> 01:16:55,680
open to homosexuality than they have
been in the past.

1876
01:16:55,950 --> 01:17:00,950
I've really believed that is a factor of
all the information that's available and

1877
01:17:01,381 --> 01:17:01,831
the,
the,

1878
01:17:01,831 --> 01:17:05,880
the amount of communication I amount of
gay people that people know from

1879
01:17:05,881 --> 01:17:08,070
television,
from news programs,

1880
01:17:08,071 --> 01:17:11,480
from all these different shows where
they get a different sense of,

1881
01:17:11,481 --> 01:17:12,710
you know,
do you see Ellen everyday?

1882
01:17:12,770 --> 01:17:14,310
Well,
gay people can't be Evil Ellen.

1883
01:17:14,311 --> 01:17:15,830
So Nice.
You know what I mean?

1884
01:17:15,831 --> 01:17:16,730
There's a lot of that.

1885
01:17:16,810 --> 01:17:18,850
I think you're totally right,
but I think that shows that the first

1886
01:17:18,851 --> 01:17:20,950
thing you said is,
is too simplistic.

1887
01:17:20,951 --> 01:17:24,370
So the thing is that the division
between the,

1888
01:17:24,371 --> 01:17:27,010
I think the last thing you point you
made is totally on the money,

1889
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:30,160
but why didn't you were saying that the
division is the idea that is easier to

1890
01:17:30,161 --> 01:17:31,720
persuade individuals and persuade the
society.

1891
01:17:31,930 --> 01:17:34,600
You persuade the society by persuading
individuals who just persuade lots of

1892
01:17:34,601 --> 01:17:37,180
individuals and they banned.
Sure.

1893
01:17:38,110 --> 01:17:38,551
Well,
okay.

1894
01:17:38,551 --> 01:17:42,420
I think we're splitting hairs here
because I think if obviously if you

1895
01:17:42,421 --> 01:17:44,580
change every individual,
you change society,

1896
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:48,720
but it's far easier to change one person
than it is to change 350 million.

1897
01:17:48,980 --> 01:17:51,770
But that's obviously true.
But you changed 350 million by changing

1898
01:17:51,830 --> 01:17:53,660
one person and one passport by banding
together.

1899
01:17:53,890 --> 01:17:57,200
But you also,
one of the ways that you changed those

1900
01:17:57,201 --> 01:18:00,200
one p that one person is by banding
together in a group,

1901
01:18:00,201 --> 01:18:01,580
right?
So gay people for example,

1902
01:18:01,581 --> 01:18:02,900
would be a good example,
but there are many,

1903
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:04,940
many good examples.
But what you're saying about individual

1904
01:18:04,941 --> 01:18:06,140
psychology,
it's important to say you're,

1905
01:18:06,230 --> 01:18:08,000
you're right about that.
So there are,

1906
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:10,070
there's a very broad scientific
agreement.

1907
01:18:10,071 --> 01:18:12,800
There are three kinds of cause of
depression and anxiety.

1908
01:18:12,801 --> 01:18:14,810
And most mental health if at all,
mental health problems,

1909
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:17,360
they're,
the ratio varies.

1910
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:19,730
So there's biological causes,
which we talked about.

1911
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:20,870
Your genes,
for example,

1912
01:18:20,871 --> 01:18:22,670
can make chemo sensitive to these
things.

1913
01:18:23,090 --> 01:18:25,370
There's psychological causes,
which are the things you're talking

1914
01:18:25,371 --> 01:18:27,140
about,
which are very real and important.

1915
01:18:27,410 --> 01:18:29,510
And there's social causes so that,
you know,

1916
01:18:29,690 --> 01:18:31,250
a lot of the other things we've talked
about,

1917
01:18:31,910 --> 01:18:34,310
and I think at a way you don't need to
play them off against each other.

1918
01:18:34,311 --> 01:18:35,300
They're all real,
right.

1919
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:37,350
And you want to deal with all of them.
Um,

1920
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:38,290
so it's not,
I don't think it's a,

1921
01:18:38,310 --> 01:18:40,940
I want to get to argue with you.
It's like you're saying we should deal

1922
01:18:40,941 --> 01:18:42,800
with the psychological factor.
And I'm saying we should deal with the

1923
01:18:42,801 --> 01:18:44,300
social factor.
You're totally right.

1924
01:18:44,301 --> 01:18:45,700
We should deal with that.
I think we should deal with Bob.

1925
01:18:45,870 --> 01:18:46,611
Yeah,
exactly.

1926
01:18:46,611 --> 01:18:48,740
I think where we certainly,
do,

1927
01:18:48,741 --> 01:18:49,200
you know what I mean?

1928
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:50,033
Yes.
Yeah,

1929
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:52,620
yeah.
But I think that the idea that,

1930
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:56,580
so like think of what you're saying in
terms of people,

1931
01:18:56,930 --> 01:18:59,130
uh,
living unfulfilled lives,

1932
01:18:59,131 --> 01:19:03,000
living in job or working in jobs that
they don't enjoy,

1933
01:19:03,001 --> 01:19:05,730
where they're being controlled by a
boss,

1934
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:10,770
it's far easier for one person to choose
to change the path of their life than to

1935
01:19:10,771 --> 01:19:13,650
try to restructure society where that
doesn't exist anymore.

1936
01:19:13,740 --> 01:19:17,490
I agree.
Ceos like this is what this is,

1937
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:20,610
is intent.
There's a Ma,

1938
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:25,500
I mean obviously that was a huge factor
in the 2016 election.

1939
01:19:25,501 --> 01:19:28,680
It was one of the things that was talked
about is a wealth inequality.

1940
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:31,800
Well,
there's no greater version of wealth

1941
01:19:31,801 --> 01:19:35,160
inequality than the difference between
the CEO of a massive company and its

1942
01:19:35,161 --> 01:19:36,600
lowest worker.
I mean,

1943
01:19:36,601 --> 01:19:39,510
it literally is like a king and a
peasant.

1944
01:19:39,820 --> 01:19:43,530
It's a very strange sort of a structure
that very recently has it become.

1945
01:19:43,530 --> 01:19:44,430
Yes,
yes.

1946
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:47,250
But it's so common.
I mean,

1947
01:19:47,251 --> 01:19:48,750
it is,
it's ingrained.

1948
01:19:48,751 --> 01:19:50,280
I mean,
how many corporations are there that

1949
01:19:50,281 --> 01:19:52,310
operate like that top down?
I mean it's,

1950
01:19:52,311 --> 01:19:55,620
it's gigantic.
And to change that I think would be far

1951
01:19:55,621 --> 01:19:59,670
more difficult than to change an
individual's path and to tell this one

1952
01:19:59,671 --> 01:20:00,510
person,
hey man,

1953
01:20:00,511 --> 01:20:03,480
what do you really want to do?
Do you really like making pottery?

1954
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:03,941
Well,
they,

1955
01:20:03,941 --> 01:20:06,990
you should try to make pottery for a
living because this working for

1956
01:20:07,380 --> 01:20:10,320
chemicals,
you're not going to ever feel fulfilled.

1957
01:20:10,321 --> 01:20:13,050
You're always gonna have that same
anxiety on Sunday night before you go to

1958
01:20:13,051 --> 01:20:14,490
bed.
You're always going to feel like shit

1959
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:17,010
while you're at work.
You're always going to be numb.

1960
01:20:17,011 --> 01:20:20,070
You're going to be probably listening to
the podcasts like this while you're

1961
01:20:20,071 --> 01:20:22,920
working just to try to pass the time.
I think you're right

1962
01:20:23,180 --> 01:20:24,580
and totally,
if,

1963
01:20:24,610 --> 01:20:27,060
if you can do it,
if you've got that margin per change,

1964
01:20:27,180 --> 01:20:29,430
100% my advice to you is that why
wouldn't you

1965
01:20:29,550 --> 01:20:32,100
be able to do it eventually?
You might not be able to do it right

1966
01:20:32,101 --> 01:20:34,050
now,
but if you plan for it,

1967
01:20:34,140 --> 01:20:35,520
why wouldn't you be able to do it?

1968
01:20:36,730 --> 01:20:38,460
I think about one of my closest
relatives,

1969
01:20:38,461 --> 01:20:39,570
right?
She's,

1970
01:20:39,630 --> 01:20:43,020
she's
very depressed.

1971
01:20:43,021 --> 01:20:45,720
She's got two young kids.
She's working really hard.

1972
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:48,810
She's in a Shitty town.
Um,

1973
01:20:49,050 --> 01:20:53,130
she has very controlled work.
I'm trying to think.

1974
01:20:53,430 --> 01:20:56,520
I've desperately tried to think of the
margins of change that I can help her

1975
01:20:56,521 --> 01:20:57,990
facilitate in her life.
Right.

1976
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:02,850
And I've really struggled.
I mean it's an environment where most

1977
01:21:02,851 --> 01:21:05,080
people are depressed.
Most people are obese.

1978
01:21:05,100 --> 01:21:06,360
This is England.
Yeah.

1979
01:21:06,390 --> 01:21:07,690
Yeah.
But I mean it could've just as easily

1980
01:21:08,100 --> 01:21:11,520
manageable spent a lot of time in the u
s but I think it's more people with this

1981
01:21:11,521 --> 01:21:14,190
problem in the u s um,
you know,

1982
01:21:14,490 --> 01:21:16,680
now I think we've essentially cut off
case.

1983
01:21:16,740 --> 01:21:20,820
That's a very nice,
anyone who has any margin of change I go

1984
01:21:20,821 --> 01:21:23,310
through in Los Connections,
the seven ways you can change your life,

1985
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:27,180
that the science at shows will reduce
her depression and anxiety.

1986
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:28,410
Very likely,
right?

1987
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:31,390
If you've got that margin.
Do I think the only disagreement trends

1988
01:21:31,391 --> 01:21:32,520
is,
I think you're more,

1989
01:21:32,940 --> 01:21:34,050
um,
you,

1990
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:38,190
you think more can be done by individual
will alone than I do probably.

1991
01:21:38,460 --> 01:21:40,890
And I would say,
but that's not disempowering in the

1992
01:21:40,891 --> 01:21:45,891
sense that I would say the most powerful
individually empowering thing you can do

1993
01:21:46,620 --> 01:21:49,830
is band together with other people like
you and fight for something better.

1994
01:21:49,831 --> 01:21:51,930
Right.
Work together towards improving yourself

1995
01:21:53,150 --> 01:21:55,920
with the people in your community and
making some sort of a bond.

1996
01:21:56,190 --> 01:21:57,780
Totally.
And one of the most moving things I

1997
01:21:57,781 --> 01:22:00,390
learned about from the book was this
incredible protest movement in Berlin.

1998
01:22:00,430 --> 01:22:02,670
I can tell you about if you want that
transformed.

1999
01:22:02,830 --> 01:22:06,030
It really is one of the places where so
much of,

2000
01:22:06,060 --> 01:22:08,910
of what I,
what I learned from the scientists

2001
01:22:08,911 --> 01:22:10,980
really fell into place with me and it
was,

2002
01:22:10,981 --> 01:22:12,240
were very isolated.

2003
01:22:12,240 --> 01:22:15,420
People came together and just said,
you know what?

2004
01:22:16,110 --> 01:22:18,960
We're not going to take this anymore and
fought for something better.

2005
01:22:18,961 --> 01:22:21,090
I can explain that it's a longer story,
but if you want me to tell about the

2006
01:22:21,091 --> 01:22:21,920
world,
but the,

2007
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:23,820
so I think you're right.
So you were saying,

2008
01:22:23,821 --> 01:22:25,410
you know,
what do you like to do when you said

2009
01:22:25,420 --> 01:22:26,970
pottery is an example of,
that is a good example.

2010
01:22:26,971 --> 01:22:29,580
But I will say it may be that what you
like to do and actually cause we're a

2011
01:22:29,581 --> 01:22:31,440
social species,
this is what most would like to do is

2012
01:22:31,890 --> 01:22:35,370
get together with the people around you
and fight for something better.

2013
01:22:35,371 --> 01:22:39,180
And I think you're totally right about
how this played out in the dynamics

2014
01:22:39,181 --> 01:22:40,500
around the election.
I remember.

2015
01:22:40,650 --> 01:22:42,810
So it really haunted me.
I was um,

2016
01:22:43,530 --> 01:22:47,430
with some people who were doing some get
out the vote work in Cleveland and

2017
01:22:48,450 --> 01:22:48,900
Cleveland.

2018
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:51,090
I mean it's like Detroit without the
poetry of the rooms,

2019
01:22:51,091 --> 01:22:52,110
right?
I mean it's shocking.

2020
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:55,050
And we were on this street in an area
called Slavic city.

2021
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:58,570
Um,
that a why it's not slavic and we're

2022
01:22:58,590 --> 01:22:59,580
going,
what do you say that,

2023
01:22:59,581 --> 01:23:04,290
I mean there's great parts of Cleveland
each on in this area and the area.

2024
01:23:05,070 --> 01:23:06,780
Yeah,
sorry to be climbing the area that I

2025
01:23:06,790 --> 01:23:07,170
was,
okay,

2026
01:23:07,170 --> 01:23:08,003
sorry.
I should have,

2027
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:09,790
it was this area of west Cleveland
called Slavic city.

2028
01:23:09,791 --> 01:23:13,570
Not the hot kick your ass.
Clearly not the whole Cleveland is like,

2029
01:23:13,571 --> 01:23:15,730
that's right.
Is that dude who had a t shirt at one of

2030
01:23:15,731 --> 01:23:18,010
my shows that I put on my instagram.
People in her death.

2031
01:23:18,670 --> 01:23:21,520
They're fucking serious about Cleveland.
They have the heavyweight champion of

2032
01:23:21,521 --> 01:23:23,590
the world,
steep vimeo chick who lives in

2033
01:23:23,591 --> 01:23:24,760
Cleveland.
So we're,

2034
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:27,180
this street is one of those
respectfully,

2035
01:23:27,190 --> 01:23:29,410
not representative of all of Cleveland.

2036
01:23:29,410 --> 01:23:30,430
Right?
Well,

2037
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:32,020
I mean you can find a place like that in
la.

2038
01:23:32,021 --> 01:23:33,540
I'll take you to skid row right now.
Oh sure,

2039
01:23:33,690 --> 01:23:35,050
sure.
We could just go to beverly hills.

2040
01:23:35,220 --> 01:23:36,640
You're your choice.
You know what I'm saying?

2041
01:23:36,641 --> 01:23:38,260
It's not an Einstein,
but the,

2042
01:23:38,261 --> 01:23:39,850
just just about the street that there
was this,

2043
01:23:41,020 --> 01:23:43,300
we're going down the street and a third
of the house has been demolished.

2044
01:23:43,780 --> 01:23:46,780
A third were abandoned or third store
have people living in them.

2045
01:23:46,781 --> 01:23:48,910
Some of them like literally behind
barbed wire.

2046
01:23:48,911 --> 01:23:50,830
Right?
Sounds like a children's math problem.

2047
01:23:51,890 --> 01:23:54,460
Sorry,
not 15 people live in this place.

2048
01:23:54,570 --> 01:23:56,880
I knew heroin.
If they've walked the streets,

2049
01:23:56,890 --> 01:24:00,520
how long does it take care I oxycontin
15 people live in that place.

2050
01:24:00,521 --> 01:24:02,410
They're on antidepressants.
Who's happier?

2051
01:24:03,700 --> 01:24:06,010
So we,
we knocked on one door and there was a

2052
01:24:06,011 --> 01:24:08,290
woman who,
from looking at how I would have guessed

2053
01:24:08,291 --> 01:24:09,220
was 60,
right.

2054
01:24:09,250 --> 01:24:11,740
She was actually the same age as me.
I was 37 at the time.

2055
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:14,080
And she was very articulate.
She was,

2056
01:24:14,081 --> 01:24:17,560
she knew that she knew a lot.
She was really fucking angry.

2057
01:24:17,950 --> 01:24:21,490
She was raging.
And um,

2058
01:24:21,970 --> 01:24:24,250
she made this verbal slip that's really
stayed with me.

2059
01:24:24,910 --> 01:24:26,110
I thought about it while you're speaking
earlier,

2060
01:24:27,310 --> 01:24:30,010
she talked about the area used to be
like for parents and grandparents,

2061
01:24:30,011 --> 01:24:32,470
right?
And she meant to say,

2062
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:35,080
when I was young,
what she actually said is when I was

2063
01:24:35,081 --> 01:24:36,880
alive,
I was like,

2064
01:24:37,330 --> 01:24:38,380
fuck.
That's how she feels,

2065
01:24:38,381 --> 01:24:39,910
right?
She feels like she has died.

2066
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:43,440
And it made me think about this,
this other researchers think about that.

2067
01:24:43,441 --> 01:24:43,980
She was saying,
this,

2068
01:24:43,980 --> 01:24:46,810
I think relates to the individual versus
collective debate that we've kind of

2069
01:24:46,811 --> 01:24:51,010
been touching on.
So native American groups in Canada,

2070
01:24:51,100 --> 01:24:54,850
they call them first nations groups have
really high suicide rates.

2071
01:24:54,850 --> 01:24:55,860
Right?
Um,

2072
01:24:56,140 --> 01:24:58,660
and this professor,
I got to interview person,

2073
01:24:58,661 --> 01:25:01,370
Michael Chandler did this really big
research on this because what we

2074
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:04,120
realized is 196 first nations groups in
Canada,

2075
01:25:04,390 --> 01:25:06,580
some of them have really high suicide
and some have none.

2076
01:25:06,790 --> 01:25:07,360
Right?
And he's like,

2077
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:10,420
why is that?
So He'd spent 10 years researching this,

2078
01:25:10,870 --> 01:25:13,540
discovered loads of things.
But one of the things he discovered was

2079
01:25:14,740 --> 01:25:18,220
some of these groups have basically been
able to fight to regain control of their

2080
01:25:18,221 --> 01:25:18,911
community.
Right?

2081
01:25:18,911 --> 01:25:21,760
They rebuilt their language,
they've rebuilt their scope,

2082
01:25:21,770 --> 01:25:24,220
control of the schools and you know,
whatever.

2083
01:25:24,790 --> 01:25:28,510
And some have just been so cut down that
they haven't been able to do that.

2084
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:32,050
Suicide rate correlates really tightly
with the amount of control they were

2085
01:25:32,051 --> 01:25:35,020
able to regain over the community in the
amount of meaning that you find in your

2086
01:25:35,021 --> 01:25:36,310
life.
I think it's about meaning,

2087
01:25:36,340 --> 01:25:38,260
it's about having a story about who you
are.

2088
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:41,530
It's about having social connections
around you so you're not alone.

2089
01:25:41,531 --> 01:25:43,570
You're part of something bigger than any
side.

2090
01:25:43,690 --> 01:25:44,590
Exactly.
So I think when you,

2091
01:25:44,591 --> 01:25:45,760
when we were talking,
I thought about that when,

2092
01:25:45,761 --> 01:25:46,594
when you were saying,
you know,

2093
01:25:46,830 --> 01:25:48,400
what,
what do you like to do?

2094
01:25:48,401 --> 01:25:50,890
What should you do if someone's
listening to this and they're lonely and

2095
01:25:50,891 --> 01:25:51,491
isolated,
you know,

2096
01:25:51,491 --> 01:25:55,330
because we're such a fractured society
and because we find it so difficult to

2097
01:25:55,331 --> 01:25:56,770
be present with each other,
right?

2098
01:25:56,980 --> 01:25:57,480
The,
the,

2099
01:25:57,480 --> 01:26:00,610
the,
the constant distraction and refracting

2100
01:26:00,611 --> 01:26:02,260
everything through screens,
which makes us be like,

2101
01:26:02,261 --> 01:26:03,440
shit,
I can talk about some of that if you

2102
01:26:03,441 --> 01:26:04,160
want.

2103
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:06,390
Um,
the,

2104
01:26:06,460 --> 01:26:07,940
the,
the actually that,

2105
01:26:07,970 --> 01:26:11,720
that initial step is quite hard because
we're so broken up,

2106
01:26:11,830 --> 01:26:13,820
right?
So it's not just the initial step,

2107
01:26:13,850 --> 01:26:15,860
it's you've gone too far in one
direction.

2108
01:26:16,010 --> 01:26:17,210
Like say,
look at it this way,

2109
01:26:17,390 --> 01:26:19,700
if we all started this neutral point,
right?

2110
01:26:20,060 --> 01:26:21,230
And W,
uh,

2111
01:26:21,231 --> 01:26:25,000
someone like Jamie does what he wants to
do and,

2112
01:26:25,001 --> 01:26:28,900
and finds a good path and starts going
in that direction and keeps improving as

2113
01:26:28,910 --> 01:26:33,890
life and then eventually is a happy
human being as an adult.

2114
01:26:34,160 --> 01:26:36,500
Or you have someone who goes the wrong
way.

2115
01:26:36,590 --> 01:26:41,420
They get addicted to food and cigarettes
and drugs and antidepressants and they

2116
01:26:41,421 --> 01:26:45,260
get into bad relationships and then they
have children that they have to take

2117
01:26:45,261 --> 01:26:47,510
care of them.
They have a job that they hate and then

2118
01:26:47,511 --> 01:26:51,440
they find themselves at 37 years old
looking like they're 65 trying to figure

2119
01:26:51,441 --> 01:26:52,400
out how to get back.

2120
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:55,430
Well,
they've got to find a way to not just

2121
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:58,460
move ahead,
but to get back to that neutral point,

2122
01:26:58,740 --> 01:27:01,250
this,
they have to go back in time over all

2123
01:27:01,251 --> 01:27:05,030
the shit they fucked up and they have a
far longer path.

2124
01:27:05,180 --> 01:27:08,540
So it's not an impossible path,
but it's a far longer path.

2125
01:27:08,570 --> 01:27:12,140
If you all,
if everyone's going in a direction and

2126
01:27:12,141 --> 01:27:16,520
that direction is 25 miles away,
but you go 37 miles backwards,

2127
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:21,560
you have to go sell 37 miles forward and
then the additional 25 miles.

2128
01:27:21,860 --> 01:27:24,260
That's the problem with people.
They look at the,

2129
01:27:24,261 --> 01:27:27,110
the,
the daunting nature of that task and

2130
01:27:27,111 --> 01:27:30,230
it's very intimidating to them and they
don't feel like they can make it.

2131
01:27:30,410 --> 01:27:35,410
They don't feel like they can,
but there is satisfaction and hope and

2132
01:27:35,871 --> 01:27:39,350
happiness and moving towards a positive
direction.

2133
01:27:40,010 --> 01:27:43,280
And that's what people have to realize.
It's not about a goal.

2134
01:27:43,460 --> 01:27:48,320
It's about the journey being a positive
journey and the feeling that you get of

2135
01:27:48,321 --> 01:27:51,650
improving your life incrementally on a
daily basis.

2136
01:27:52,130 --> 01:27:55,550
And it's also the mindset that you carry
with you on that journey.

2137
01:27:55,850 --> 01:27:58,160
You can't look at yourself and go,
God,

2138
01:27:58,161 --> 01:28:01,160
why am I not successful yet?
Why am I not rich?

2139
01:28:01,161 --> 01:28:03,290
Why am I not this?
Why am I not that?

2140
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:06,410
You have to say,
I am better than I was yesterday.

2141
01:28:06,590 --> 01:28:09,830
Tomorrow will be better than I am today
and I'm on the right path.

2142
01:28:10,040 --> 01:28:14,540
And there is a lot of deep satisfaction
and happiness and being on the right

2143
01:28:14,541 --> 01:28:15,620
path.
Now,

2144
01:28:15,621 --> 01:28:17,780
if you're a person who wants to be an
author,

2145
01:28:17,930 --> 01:28:22,930
but instead you're an accountant every
day you spend not feeding that idea that

2146
01:28:23,421 --> 01:28:26,600
you can be an author is going to chew
away at you,

2147
01:28:26,601 --> 01:28:30,470
it's going to chip away at you and it's
going to move you away from that neutral

2148
01:28:30,471 --> 01:28:30,980
point.

2149
01:28:30,980 --> 01:28:32,180
Many,
many miles.

2150
01:28:33,320 --> 01:28:35,240
I totally agree.
I totally agree with you and I think

2151
01:28:35,241 --> 01:28:38,240
that the,
that thing about when people realize

2152
01:28:38,241 --> 01:28:40,210
they have agency,
that's one of the most,

2153
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:42,710
especially,
and it goes back to what was saying

2154
01:28:42,711 --> 01:28:44,060
about work,
if you will,

2155
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:46,850
spending nine hours a day being
controlled,

2156
01:28:47,150 --> 01:28:48,740
one of the things you do to get through
that,

2157
01:28:48,741 --> 01:28:50,930
is it a process of internal deadening?
Right.

2158
01:28:50,931 --> 01:28:53,360
I remember talking to just a,
the guy in the paint store,

2159
01:28:53,361 --> 01:28:54,600
he would say,
you know how it would just get home,

2160
01:28:54,650 --> 01:28:58,340
go home,
and initially it was alcohol and then

2161
01:28:58,341 --> 01:29:01,470
later oxy,
he would just want to numb himself.

2162
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:01,980
Right,
right.

2163
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:04,230
Because there's an internal deadline you
have to do to get through that.

2164
01:29:04,231 --> 01:29:07,140
Which is why I think one of the key
aspects that I talk about those

2165
01:29:07,141 --> 01:29:08,760
connections is this transformation of
work.

2166
01:29:08,761 --> 01:29:12,900
If the thing that most people are doing
most of the time is making 87% of us

2167
01:29:12,920 --> 01:29:15,900
would,
we don't like it at the best bat.

2168
01:29:16,170 --> 01:29:18,000
You've got to go to the heart of that.
Right.

2169
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:20,940
And,
and you know we're talking about margins

2170
01:29:20,941 --> 01:29:23,190
or change.
People who set up that bike store in

2171
01:29:23,191 --> 01:29:25,110
Baltimore,
they were working class people.

2172
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:27,660
You know who,
who I'd not had fancy educations.

2173
01:29:27,870 --> 01:29:29,730
They set up a democratic cooperative,
right?

2174
01:29:29,900 --> 01:29:30,490
They,
they,

2175
01:29:30,490 --> 01:29:33,180
they transformed their lives.
So they were a good example of people

2176
01:29:33,181 --> 01:29:35,790
who appear to have a relatively limited
margin.

2177
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,950
They were low wage workers in a,
in a,

2178
01:29:37,951 --> 01:29:40,800
in a low wage industry who,
you know,

2179
01:29:40,860 --> 01:29:42,600
have made this transition.

2180
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:46,260
So I'm certainly not saying that people
can't make these transitions even in

2181
01:29:46,261 --> 01:29:48,390
difficult circumstances.
They absolutely can.

2182
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:49,770
I just think,
um,

2183
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:51,610
yeah,
I think I'll think about the,

2184
01:29:51,611 --> 01:29:53,460
the,
the farmer in the field in Cambodia,

2185
01:29:53,461 --> 01:29:55,560
right?
Whose legs blown off and he's in this

2186
01:29:55,561 --> 01:29:59,190
field and it's agony.
He needed to change his life,

2187
01:29:59,191 --> 01:30:01,050
but he also needed someone to buy him a
cow.

2188
01:30:01,200 --> 01:30:02,910
Right?
He couldn't have bought that couch on

2189
01:30:02,911 --> 01:30:04,640
his own and that situation,
yeah,

2190
01:30:05,250 --> 01:30:07,370
he would be an illustration or,
um,

2191
01:30:07,970 --> 01:30:09,540
or the rats in rat park.
Right.

2192
01:30:10,740 --> 01:30:13,830
If you're in that isolated cage,
I mean it's not a great example because

2193
01:30:13,850 --> 01:30:15,640
you know,
the rat can't leave the cage.

2194
01:30:15,641 --> 01:30:17,760
Whereas you could argue,
but you see the point I'm making.

2195
01:30:17,810 --> 01:30:19,710
I do.
You could attribute it just to

2196
01:30:19,711 --> 01:30:21,690
individual.
I know this is not what you're doing,

2197
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:23,930
but I think some people,
um,

2198
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:26,850
attribute this just to,
uh,

2199
01:30:26,910 --> 01:30:27,750
is definitely what you're saying.

2200
01:30:27,750 --> 01:30:30,120
But just to individual weakness or
individual failing,

2201
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:33,680
what I think that the identity is
psychology is a significant component of

2202
01:30:33,690 --> 01:30:36,720
that alongside other components.
I don't think of it that way at all.

2203
01:30:36,750 --> 01:30:40,360
I think I think of it as poor choices.
I don't think of it as individual film.

2204
01:30:40,361 --> 01:30:42,990
I've made many,
many poor choices in my life.

2205
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:46,590
Here's one of the big ones.
You could tell people because there's a

2206
01:30:46,591 --> 01:30:49,560
lot of people that are listening to this
at various stages of their life.

2207
01:30:49,890 --> 01:30:53,400
If you're young and you have an open
future,

2208
01:30:53,401 --> 01:30:56,020
you don't have massive obligations and
debt and all the,

2209
01:30:56,021 --> 01:30:58,050
all the different things that become a
real hindrance.

2210
01:30:58,051 --> 01:31:01,770
As you get older,
move towards a direction that is

2211
01:31:01,771 --> 01:31:04,640
attractive to you.
Do not move towards a direction that is

2212
01:31:04,650 --> 01:31:06,060
safe.
Don't do it.

2213
01:31:06,370 --> 01:31:09,660
Because if you do do that,
if you just take that safe job and then

2214
01:31:09,661 --> 01:31:12,150
there's a lot of people that will know,
a lot of people can do that.

2215
01:31:12,330 --> 01:31:16,830
That is a bullshit stupid way to think
and that will fuck you that that way to

2216
01:31:16,831 --> 01:31:20,460
think we'll fuck you.
You can do what you do,

2217
01:31:20,700 --> 01:31:23,220
what you choose to do.
You can get better at things.

2218
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:27,840
If what you choose to do,
you can move forward and try to figure

2219
01:31:27,841 --> 01:31:30,900
out a way to carve a path through that
life and it's not going to be easy,

2220
01:31:30,901 --> 01:31:35,460
but nothing worth doing is easy.
But this idea that it'll give you want

2221
01:31:35,461 --> 01:31:38,340
to just do construction if that's
appealing to you,

2222
01:31:38,341 --> 01:31:40,830
you would like to just be a laborer and
there's,

2223
01:31:40,831 --> 01:31:42,990
there's look,
there's a need for that in society,

2224
01:31:42,991 --> 01:31:44,580
but it doesn't bother you.
It's,

2225
01:31:44,581 --> 01:31:47,610
but find out what bothers you and find
out what you enjoy.

2226
01:31:47,790 --> 01:31:50,100
If you're a labor and you really want to
be a songwriter,

2227
01:31:50,101 --> 01:31:52,290
well you better fucking chase that
songwriting shit.

2228
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:54,630
You better do it because if you don't do
it,

2229
01:31:54,631 --> 01:31:57,930
you don't want to be a 60 year old man
sitting around just depressed and

2230
01:31:57,931 --> 01:32:00,010
crying.
Then maybe you call

2231
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:03,660
your friend up who does do that for a
living and he's having a great time and

2232
01:32:03,820 --> 01:32:07,330
he just released his new album and you
both started out together in high school

2233
01:32:07,331 --> 01:32:10,650
and now here you are at different stages
of your life and you,

2234
01:32:10,651 --> 01:32:13,810
you haven't pursued your interest,
you haven't pursued your passion,

2235
01:32:13,811 --> 01:32:15,490
you haven't pursued what you really want
to do.

2236
01:32:15,890 --> 01:32:17,560
I,
but to endorse every word you just said,

2237
01:32:17,650 --> 01:32:21,430
I would just add a layer alongside it,
which is,

2238
01:32:21,880 --> 01:32:25,090
and we should change our society so
fewer people get trapped and more people

2239
01:32:25,450 --> 01:32:28,330
at the moment,
a lot of people feel we want to be

2240
01:32:28,331 --> 01:32:30,070
giving people trampolines up.
Right?

2241
01:32:30,100 --> 01:32:31,960
Yeah.
I think universal basic income is

2242
01:32:31,961 --> 01:32:34,090
probably a way that that's going to
start happening.

2243
01:32:34,110 --> 01:32:35,590
Yeah.
I think that can happen.

2244
01:32:35,620 --> 01:32:38,170
That can help a lot of people where your
basic needs,

2245
01:32:38,171 --> 01:32:40,120
your food is taken care of.

2246
01:32:40,330 --> 01:32:43,030
And I think President Obama talks about
this towards the end of his term,

2247
01:32:43,031 --> 01:32:44,440
partly because he said,
look,

2248
01:32:44,690 --> 01:32:46,300
um,
actually I don't attribute this to him.

2249
01:32:46,301 --> 01:32:47,860
I can't move.
He said it made this point in this way,

2250
01:32:47,861 --> 01:32:50,770
but it was interviewed wired magazine
and he said he thinks this will have to

2251
01:32:50,771 --> 01:32:54,070
happen in the next 20 years.
Partly because of the extraordinary

2252
01:32:54,071 --> 01:32:58,270
disruption that's coming to the economy
through robotization automation.

2253
01:32:58,271 --> 01:33:01,420
Exactly.
So Elon Musk said that recently as well.

2254
01:33:01,450 --> 01:33:02,830
Yeah,
well I think Elan Musk is saying it for

2255
01:33:02,840 --> 01:33:05,140
slightly different motive and that he
knows the pitch books are going to come

2256
01:33:05,141 --> 01:33:06,640
from people like him and Mark
Zuckerberg.

2257
01:33:06,641 --> 01:33:09,730
The anger is going to be directed at
Silicon Valley if there isn't a

2258
01:33:09,731 --> 01:33:11,920
universal basic income.
I'm sure they have genuine concern for

2259
01:33:11,921 --> 01:33:13,500
people as well.
But I think the,

2260
01:33:13,510 --> 01:33:16,150
so you think that's really why he's,
he's saying that,

2261
01:33:16,690 --> 01:33:20,710
oh my God,
maybe I'm just more cynical because they

2262
01:33:20,711 --> 01:33:21,910
just make so much money.

2263
01:33:22,450 --> 01:33:23,890
Well,
I can't remember who said that.

2264
01:33:23,891 --> 01:33:24,724
Someone said,
you know,

2265
01:33:24,730 --> 01:33:27,640
the path the economies are,
and there's going to be seven tech

2266
01:33:27,641 --> 01:33:30,040
billionaires and everyone else employed
to give them massages.

2267
01:33:30,041 --> 01:33:32,830
Right?
And I think there's something going on

2268
01:33:32,831 --> 01:33:34,600
here,
which is I think they know at some level

2269
01:33:34,601 --> 01:33:38,230
if they don't start providing some,
if the society doesn't start providing

2270
01:33:38,231 --> 01:33:41,020
some baseline of security,
I forget the figure.

2271
01:33:41,021 --> 01:33:44,200
I think 3 million people in the United
States make a living through driving

2272
01:33:44,920 --> 01:33:47,320
that's not going to exist in 10 years
from now probably right.

2273
01:33:47,440 --> 01:33:50,140
Self driving cars are likely to just,
that's going to be gone,

2274
01:33:50,210 --> 01:33:53,150
right?
That that's an extraordinary disruption

2275
01:33:53,151 --> 01:33:54,640
to the economy.
Those are mostly men.

2276
01:33:54,740 --> 01:33:58,660
They're mostly men with low educational
achievement attainments for various

2277
01:33:58,661 --> 01:34:00,040
reasons.
A lot which are not their fault.

2278
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:01,900
Um,
and,

2279
01:34:01,970 --> 01:34:03,730
and you know,
that's devastating,

2280
01:34:03,731 --> 01:34:05,260
right?
So I think you're right,

2281
01:34:05,261 --> 01:34:09,700
the universal basic income is one of the
important strategies that can,

2282
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:10,660
that can kind of deal with that.

2283
01:34:10,660 --> 01:34:12,200
But I think this comes back to,
I think you,

2284
01:34:12,220 --> 01:34:16,390
you've got your going back to think that
there is a kind of recurring theme in

2285
01:34:16,391 --> 01:34:17,380
this conversation,
which is,

2286
01:34:18,730 --> 01:34:20,530
you know,
for both my books for chasing the scream

2287
01:34:20,531 --> 01:34:22,840
and pulse connections can addiction and
it depression,

2288
01:34:22,841 --> 01:34:26,230
anxiety.
Both of them required me to go all over

2289
01:34:26,231 --> 01:34:29,110
the world and just look at really
different places that do things really

2290
01:34:29,111 --> 01:34:31,360
differently.
And there was some things that just

2291
01:34:31,361 --> 01:34:32,710
Rickard for both,
right?

2292
01:34:32,950 --> 01:34:35,650
Give example with addiction,
the places that have most reduced

2293
01:34:35,651 --> 01:34:39,590
addiction have not been the places that
have said this is an attributing this to

2294
01:34:39,591 --> 01:34:42,550
you very clearly are not saying this,
but people whose the places that have

2295
01:34:42,551 --> 01:34:45,100
said this is a problem for the
individual and the individual needs to

2296
01:34:45,101 --> 01:34:48,070
fucking sort themselves out,
have a massive and growing addiction

2297
01:34:48,071 --> 01:34:49,630
crisis from gets worse and worse.

2298
01:34:49,900 --> 01:34:51,550
The places that I went to where they
said,

2299
01:34:51,551 --> 01:34:54,100
actually this is a collective problem.
We need a collective solution.

2300
01:34:54,520 --> 01:34:56,470
We're very different.
So Portugal for example,

2301
01:34:56,471 --> 01:34:59,060
in the year two,
how one of the worst drug problems in

2302
01:34:59,061 --> 01:34:59,894
the world,
right?

2303
01:35:00,140 --> 01:35:02,330
1% of the population was addicted to
heroin.

2304
01:35:02,331 --> 01:35:05,750
It was incredible.
Every year the problem got worse as they

2305
01:35:05,751 --> 01:35:07,940
tried the American way more and more
rested,

2306
01:35:07,941 --> 01:35:09,590
more people in prison,
more people.

2307
01:35:09,950 --> 01:35:13,250
And one day the prime minister and the
leader of the opposition got together

2308
01:35:13,251 --> 01:35:14,090
and they were like,
look,

2309
01:35:14,091 --> 01:35:15,440
we can't go on like this,
right?

2310
01:35:15,441 --> 01:35:17,960
We can't have ever more people in our
contributing data to heroin.

2311
01:35:17,961 --> 01:35:20,360
Where are we going to do?
So it was quite bold thing.

2312
01:35:20,510 --> 01:35:22,610
They set up a panel led by an amazing
man.

2313
01:35:22,611 --> 01:35:24,470
I got to know doctor [inaudible].
Um,

2314
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:26,630
and they said to this panel,
you guys go away,

2315
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:30,200
figure out what would actually solve
this and we've agreed in advance.

2316
01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:31,820
We'll do whatever you recommend.
Right?

2317
01:35:32,360 --> 01:35:34,760
So they go,
it'd be like if trump and chuck Schumer

2318
01:35:34,761 --> 01:35:35,930
and Nancy Polosi agreed,
they would,

2319
01:35:35,960 --> 01:35:39,230
everyone would abide by finding on this.
So they go away.

2320
01:35:39,231 --> 01:35:41,510
They look at all the evidence including
rat park loads of the things we've

2321
01:35:41,511 --> 01:35:43,130
talked about.
They came back and said,

2322
01:35:43,131 --> 01:35:46,250
decriminalize all drugs from cannabis to
crack everything.

2323
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:48,020
But,
and this is the crucial next step.

2324
01:35:48,290 --> 01:35:52,100
Take all the money we currently spend on
fucking people's lives up on arresting

2325
01:35:52,101 --> 01:35:52,760
them,
shaming them,

2326
01:35:52,760 --> 01:35:54,080
stigmatizing them,
imprisoning them,

2327
01:35:55,190 --> 01:35:57,170
and spend it instead on turning their
lives around.

2328
01:35:57,350 --> 01:35:59,840
And interestingly,
it wasn't really what we think of.

2329
01:35:59,841 --> 01:36:01,430
It wasn't,
there was a little bit of residential

2330
01:36:01,431 --> 01:36:04,010
rehab.
Most of it was a big program of job

2331
01:36:04,011 --> 01:36:06,710
creation.
They set up micro loans so people with

2332
01:36:06,711 --> 01:36:09,770
addiction problems could set up and run
small businesses about things they cared

2333
01:36:09,771 --> 01:36:10,340
about.

2334
01:36:10,340 --> 01:36:12,380
They set up a big program,
subsidized work.

2335
01:36:12,381 --> 01:36:13,580
So,
um,

2336
01:36:13,940 --> 01:36:15,560
you know,
say you've used to be a mechanic,

2337
01:36:15,561 --> 01:36:17,810
they go to a garage,
they say if you employ this guy for a

2338
01:36:17,810 --> 01:36:19,130
year,
we'll pay half his wages.

2339
01:36:19,131 --> 01:36:20,780
Right.
The results in Portugal have been

2340
01:36:20,781 --> 01:36:22,640
incredible.
Couldn't the best scientific study

2341
01:36:22,790 --> 01:36:25,850
published in the British journal of
criminology injecting drug use fell by

2342
01:36:25,851 --> 01:36:30,410
more than 50% overdose deaths,
massively fell HIV massively fail.

2343
01:36:30,680 --> 01:36:33,680
One thing that was so striking there was
going around and speaking to people.

2344
01:36:33,681 --> 01:36:36,260
I mean one of the most moving into that,
if the chasing the scream is with them,

2345
01:36:36,590 --> 01:36:39,530
a guy called wildfit guerra who was the
top drug cop in Portugal,

2346
01:36:40,040 --> 01:36:42,530
and he led the opposition to the
decriminalization when it first

2347
01:36:42,531 --> 01:36:43,310
happened,
right?

2348
01:36:43,310 --> 01:36:45,620
[inaudible] he said,
this is fucking madness.

2349
01:36:45,650 --> 01:36:47,570
We're going to have a massive explosion
in drug use.

2350
01:36:48,110 --> 01:36:49,010
It's going to be a nightmare.

2351
01:36:49,010 --> 01:36:52,610
And he said to me,
everything I said would happen,

2352
01:36:52,611 --> 01:36:54,860
didn't happen,
and everything the other side said would

2353
01:36:54,861 --> 01:36:55,694
happen,
did.

2354
01:36:55,700 --> 01:36:58,910
And it talks about how he felt really
ashamed that it spent 20 years before

2355
01:36:58,911 --> 01:37:00,810
the decriminalization fucking people's
lives up.

2356
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:03,710
And I think that goes to the debate that
we're talking about because that was now

2357
01:37:03,711 --> 01:37:05,150
that's individuals changing,
right?

2358
01:37:05,180 --> 01:37:08,060
That's very clearly individual changing,
making better choices,

2359
01:37:08,330 --> 01:37:10,670
but they're making those better choices
in a context,

2360
01:37:10,671 --> 01:37:13,250
a context where the society,
instead of beating them down,

2361
01:37:13,251 --> 01:37:14,840
it's trying to lift them up.
But you see what I mean?

2362
01:37:14,841 --> 01:37:15,560
It's a very good,
yeah,

2363
01:37:15,560 --> 01:37:17,050
good point.
It's a very important point.

2364
01:37:17,051 --> 01:37:20,320
And what Portugal is done should be
studied by our country,

2365
01:37:20,321 --> 01:37:23,860
which is now falling right back into the
old Nancy Reagan.

2366
01:37:23,861 --> 01:37:27,730
Just say no bullshit days with Jeff
sessions at the helm of catastrophe.

2367
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:31,360
He's a terrifying person in that regard
cause he's so ignorant as to what's

2368
01:37:31,361 --> 01:37:32,470
going on.
He's so ignorant.

2369
01:37:32,471 --> 01:37:34,420
He's still calling marijuana gateway
drug.

2370
01:37:34,480 --> 01:37:35,410
Yeah,
he's a fool.

2371
01:37:35,680 --> 01:37:36,491
I mean,
he really is.

2372
01:37:36,491 --> 01:37:39,250
And that the,
the pattern is terrifying because

2373
01:37:39,580 --> 01:37:42,730
they're trying to call Kratom and opiate
right now.

2374
01:37:42,760 --> 01:37:43,331
There,
there's,

2375
01:37:43,331 --> 01:37:48,331
there's all sorts of a resistance to
what we know of as safe alternatives to

2376
01:37:50,021 --> 01:37:54,220
pharmaceutical medications like cbd.
That's another one they're demonizing.

2377
01:37:54,340 --> 01:37:56,100
They want to categorize that with heroin

2378
01:37:56,100 --> 01:37:58,530
and cocaine.
It's fucking terrifying.

2379
01:37:58,560 --> 01:37:59,020
It's,
it's,

2380
01:37:59,020 --> 01:38:01,530
it's a very,
very weird time because there's so much

2381
01:38:01,531 --> 01:38:05,790
evidence and so much science and so much
history when it comes to things like

2382
01:38:05,791 --> 01:38:09,750
Portugal where it's been successful to
decriminalize everything and spend the

2383
01:38:09,751 --> 01:38:11,970
money on treatment programs,
but they're ignoring that.

2384
01:38:12,240 --> 01:38:14,040
They're ignoring that because it's
convenient.

2385
01:38:14,250 --> 01:38:16,140
You're so right.
But my concern is it's not.

2386
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:18,990
I've Jeff sessions is,
you could imagine what I think about

2387
01:38:18,991 --> 01:38:21,390
Jeff Sessions is disgusting and insane
what he saying.

2388
01:38:21,990 --> 01:38:24,270
But my worry is it's not a,
well,

2389
01:38:24,271 --> 01:38:25,620
I've worried about jeff sessions
primarily,

2390
01:38:25,621 --> 01:38:27,600
but my other worry is it's not just jeff
sessions.

2391
01:38:27,601 --> 01:38:30,470
I actually think even our side,
you know,

2392
01:38:31,620 --> 01:38:35,250
when it comes to the opioid crisis,
I think had been talking about this and

2393
01:38:35,251 --> 01:38:39,540
quite quite the wrong way.
So it made me realize actually how deep

2394
01:38:39,541 --> 01:38:42,930
this Nancy Reagan's script is in the
culture that even liberals,

2395
01:38:42,931 --> 01:38:45,450
my side of politics,
it basically been saying their story

2396
01:38:45,451 --> 01:38:49,410
about the pharmaceutical,
the opioid crisis is basically evil drug

2397
01:38:49,411 --> 01:38:51,810
dealers came along,
they gave people these drugs,

2398
01:38:51,811 --> 01:38:52,860
they got accidentally hurt.

2399
01:38:52,860 --> 01:38:54,810
In this case,
the evil drug dealers or the big Pharma,

2400
01:38:55,200 --> 01:38:57,540
they've got them accidentally hooked.
Um,

2401
01:38:57,840 --> 01:38:59,760
and that's why we have this crisis right
now.

2402
01:38:59,761 --> 01:39:01,240
There's,
as you can tell from our conversation

2403
01:39:01,241 --> 01:39:03,150
and antidepressants,
there's a lot to criticize big farmer

2404
01:39:03,151 --> 01:39:05,340
about.
I'm very critical of them.

2405
01:39:05,580 --> 01:39:08,070
But that story is just ridiculously
simple.

2406
01:39:08,071 --> 01:39:10,530
If that were true,
antidepressant prescriptions had been

2407
01:39:10,531 --> 01:39:12,690
given across the United States,
right?

2408
01:39:12,900 --> 01:39:15,270
If that were true,
it would not make sense.

2409
01:39:15,550 --> 01:39:19,860
Now the opioid prescriptions are also
concentrated.

2410
01:39:19,890 --> 01:39:24,600
The opiate addictions are also
concentrated in the places where suicide

2411
01:39:24,601 --> 01:39:26,760
is highest,
where depression is highest,

2412
01:39:27,060 --> 01:39:30,120
where of course it's some everywhere,
but there's a reason for that,

2413
01:39:30,121 --> 01:39:30,931
right?
Angus Dayton,

2414
01:39:30,931 --> 01:39:33,730
the economist who studied this described
the opioid deaths,

2415
01:39:33,770 --> 01:39:34,770
despair,
deaths,

2416
01:39:34,771 --> 01:39:38,140
right?
If you go to the places where you turn,

2417
01:39:38,230 --> 01:39:39,480
right,
we're in the country and when I go to

2418
01:39:39,500 --> 01:39:42,510
places that have been most affected by
the opioid crisis,

2419
01:39:43,140 --> 01:39:45,480
what's going on,
he said he'd been deprived of the things

2420
01:39:45,481 --> 01:39:47,820
that make life meaningful,
so they want to be an Easter ties to all

2421
01:39:47,821 --> 01:39:48,420
the time.

2422
01:39:48,420 --> 01:39:51,210
There's a devastating line.
Marianne faithful.

2423
01:39:51,211 --> 01:39:53,000
He was,
Mick Jagger is best known for being Mick

2424
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:54,300
Jagger's girlfriend,
but kind of pisses me off cause thinks

2425
01:39:54,340 --> 01:39:55,890
she's even better than Mick Jagger,
but she was,

2426
01:39:56,280 --> 01:39:58,280
I know it was controversial.
Better than Mick Jagger.

2427
01:39:58,281 --> 01:40:00,300
There's controversial,
I best fucking conversations.

2428
01:40:01,210 --> 01:40:02,280
Shut it down,
Jamie.

2429
01:40:02,610 --> 01:40:06,000
So Marianne Faithfull had a heroin
addiction in the 60s when she was

2430
01:40:06,001 --> 01:40:09,540
homeless and she has this very
challenging line in her.

2431
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:11,280
In her memoir,
she says something like,

2432
01:40:11,610 --> 01:40:13,920
heroin saved my life because if it
wasn't the heroin,

2433
01:40:13,921 --> 01:40:15,090
I would have killed myself.
Right.

2434
01:40:15,660 --> 01:40:19,380
And don't misunderstand what I'm saying.
Heroin is not a good solution to despair

2435
01:40:19,700 --> 01:40:22,110
if we want,
if clearly for all sorts of very obvious

2436
01:40:22,111 --> 01:40:24,960
reasons,
if we want to understand why there's

2437
01:40:24,961 --> 01:40:27,540
been this huge increase in opiod use,
we have to understand these things that

2438
01:40:27,541 --> 01:40:29,610
I'm writing about.
His connections to the World Health

2439
01:40:29,610 --> 01:40:31,770
Organization is explaining this deep
kind of dispatch.

2440
01:40:31,980 --> 01:40:34,560
And my worry is that,
cause you're back to the worry about how

2441
01:40:34,561 --> 01:40:36,300
our side is getting it wrong.
So we've got jeff sessions getting it

2442
01:40:36,301 --> 01:40:37,830
wrong in the most obvious,
insane way,

2443
01:40:37,850 --> 01:40:38,910
right.
You know,

2444
01:40:38,940 --> 01:40:41,810
it's just we need to crack down on the
Mexicans and that will store it.

2445
01:40:42,050 --> 01:40:44,310
We,
the United States has spent $1 trillion

2446
01:40:45,120 --> 01:40:47,820
on the war on drugs.
It's done it for a hundred years.

2447
01:40:48,060 --> 01:40:51,090
It's imprisoned more people than any
other country in human history.

2448
01:40:51,091 --> 01:40:53,590
And at the end of all that,
you guys can't even keep drugs out of

2449
01:40:53,591 --> 01:40:56,080
your prisons where you pay people to
what we're on the fucking perimeter the

2450
01:40:56,081 --> 01:40:57,970
whole time.
So good luck keeping them out of a

2451
01:40:57,971 --> 01:40:59,710
country with two,
3000 mile borders.

2452
01:40:59,890 --> 01:41:03,910
That is so ridiculous and so absurd that
it's not just that.

2453
01:41:03,911 --> 01:41:08,290
It's why would you think that you could
tell a grown adult what they can and

2454
01:41:08,291 --> 01:41:09,250
can't do with their body?

2455
01:41:09,310 --> 01:41:10,370
Of course,
boss,

2456
01:41:10,380 --> 01:41:12,390
that really simple.
I think I'm,

2457
01:41:12,391 --> 01:41:15,010
I'm pretty sure all of your listeners
agree with this on GSA or pretty much

2458
01:41:15,011 --> 01:41:17,560
all of them agree that on jeff sessions,
what I think more of them will be

2459
01:41:17,561 --> 01:41:20,950
tempted by.
We'll be the more liberal argument.

2460
01:41:20,951 --> 01:41:22,720
I says as the liberals are not attacking
liberals,

2461
01:41:22,721 --> 01:41:24,130
but the,
the more liberal argument,

2462
01:41:24,131 --> 01:41:27,420
which is this simplistic,
even Bernie Sanders who I love and would

2463
01:41:27,421 --> 01:41:28,750
have voted for,
uh,

2464
01:41:28,840 --> 01:41:30,160
well I think he,
he's got this wrong,

2465
01:41:30,161 --> 01:41:30,994
which is the,
uh,

2466
01:41:31,180 --> 01:41:33,400
although I think Bernie Sanders has
politics would deal with some of the

2467
01:41:33,401 --> 01:41:34,930
deeper problems as well.
Clearly,

2468
01:41:35,260 --> 01:41:38,140
but there's this story that it's about
the drug companies.

2469
01:41:38,260 --> 01:41:41,080
We've got to look at the one place that
solved an opioid crisis.

2470
01:41:41,081 --> 01:41:42,820
If we talked about Portugal,
the one other place.

2471
01:41:43,090 --> 01:41:45,250
So Switzerland,
I'm a Swiss citizen,

2472
01:41:45,251 --> 01:41:46,500
come my dad's from there as well as
British,

2473
01:41:46,520 --> 01:41:51,010
obviously tristle until a massive heroin
problem in the 90s right?

2474
01:41:51,010 --> 01:41:52,260
Huge.
Almost as you know,

2475
01:41:52,270 --> 01:41:53,930
not quite as bad as what's happening at
opioids say,

2476
01:41:53,931 --> 01:41:58,931
but it was massive and uh,
Switzerland got this amazing kickass

2477
01:41:59,441 --> 01:42:04,441
female President Call Ruth Dreifuss to
explain to people that when you hear the

2478
01:42:04,451 --> 01:42:07,570
word legalization,
what you picture is anarchy and chaos,

2479
01:42:07,571 --> 01:42:10,840
right?
What we have now is anarchy and chaos.

2480
01:42:10,990 --> 01:42:13,750
When you prohibit drugs,
what you get is unknown criminals

2481
01:42:13,870 --> 01:42:18,280
selling unknown chemicals to unknown
drug users all in the dark filled with

2482
01:42:18,281 --> 01:42:19,360
violence,
disease and chaos.

2483
01:42:19,570 --> 01:42:21,670
What she proposed to do is legalized
heroin,

2484
01:42:21,700 --> 01:42:23,140
right?
It's important to understand that.

2485
01:42:23,141 --> 01:42:24,910
Well,
that doesn't mean it doesn't mean

2486
01:42:24,911 --> 01:42:26,940
there's like a heroin Ireland,
the cvs in,

2487
01:42:26,941 --> 01:42:28,420
in Switzerland,
right?

2488
01:42:28,810 --> 01:42:30,820
So different things that can be
legalized differently.

2489
01:42:30,821 --> 01:42:33,490
I don't know the rules in La,
but I'm pretty sure you could legally if

2490
01:42:33,491 --> 01:42:37,270
you wanted to own a dog,
a monkey and a lion.

2491
01:42:37,420 --> 01:42:38,740
But I'm pretty sure the rules are
different,

2492
01:42:38,741 --> 01:42:39,491
right?
Yeah.

2493
01:42:39,491 --> 01:42:40,950
I don't think you're going on a monkey.
You're aligned.

2494
01:42:40,951 --> 01:42:41,630
But you could,
you know,

2495
01:42:41,630 --> 01:42:44,260
if you really wanted to one,
and you were reaching and you could get

2496
01:42:44,261 --> 01:42:46,510
them in Texas,
in Texas for something that you could do

2497
01:42:46,511 --> 01:42:48,920
whatever the fuck you want,
except you can't have pot in Texas.

2498
01:42:49,280 --> 01:42:51,220
Hilarious.
So it's pretty sure in Texas it's

2499
01:42:51,221 --> 01:42:52,180
licensed.
So you could,

2500
01:42:52,181 --> 01:42:53,500
you know,
they're all legal,

2501
01:42:53,501 --> 01:42:54,940
but they're legal in different ways.
Right.

2502
01:42:55,270 --> 01:42:57,010
And it's similar way.
What Ruth Dreifuss,

2503
01:42:57,011 --> 01:42:59,710
the Swiss president was praising his
heroin should be legal,

2504
01:42:59,711 --> 01:43:01,300
but not in the way that alcohol is
legal.

2505
01:43:01,301 --> 01:43:04,450
So the way it works is if you've got
heroin problem in Switzerland,

2506
01:43:04,630 --> 01:43:07,210
you're assigned to a clinic.
I went to the one in Geneva where the

2507
01:43:07,211 --> 01:43:08,950
former president now lives across the
street,

2508
01:43:08,951 --> 01:43:12,130
which tells you something and you go,
you,

2509
01:43:12,150 --> 01:43:13,660
you,
you got to go early in the morning for

2510
01:43:13,661 --> 01:43:14,410
reasons I'll explain.

2511
01:43:14,410 --> 01:43:16,860
You're giving your heroin there.
You can't take it out with you.

2512
01:43:17,380 --> 01:43:19,690
You've got to use it there.
And then you leave and you go to your

2513
01:43:19,691 --> 01:43:22,240
job cause they give you,
they do two things and it's the exact

2514
01:43:22,241 --> 01:43:25,490
opposite of what's been proposed in the
u s what's being priced in the USA is

2515
01:43:25,900 --> 01:43:29,800
stop prescribing and don't give support.
Right.

2516
01:43:29,801 --> 01:43:32,980
Well they didn't think Switzerland is
exact opposite in Switzerland.

2517
01:43:33,190 --> 01:43:35,590
They'll give you the drug you were
addicted to and then they give you loads

2518
01:43:35,591 --> 01:43:38,230
of support to figure out why you're in
such pain in the first place.

2519
01:43:38,380 --> 01:43:41,200
That helped me get housing.
They get your subsidized work.

2520
01:43:41,500 --> 01:43:43,870
Um,
they give you loads of therapy that you,

2521
01:43:43,871 --> 01:43:46,150
are you aware of a booger?
Yeah,

2522
01:43:46,151 --> 01:43:46,690
of course.
Yeah.

2523
01:43:46,690 --> 01:43:49,870
But that's probably one of the very best
ways for people to quit drugs,

2524
01:43:50,440 --> 01:43:52,010
especially some horrible drug.

2525
01:43:52,190 --> 01:43:56,000
And it's a ruthlessly introspective drug
that many,

2526
01:43:56,001 --> 01:43:58,910
many people have found great success and
kicking heroin,

2527
01:43:58,911 --> 01:44:00,710
cigarettes,
alcoholism,

2528
01:44:01,210 --> 01:44:03,470
uh,
getting over past abuse.

2529
01:44:03,500 --> 01:44:04,333
I mean,
it is,

2530
01:44:04,580 --> 01:44:08,570
it's a long experience.
It can last more than 24 hours.

2531
01:44:08,900 --> 01:44:12,260
Totally illegal in the United States.
But a lot of people go to Mexico and do

2532
01:44:12,261 --> 01:44:14,450
it.
And I've had very good friends that have

2533
01:44:14,451 --> 01:44:19,330
had problems with pills that went over
there and kicked him because of the Boga

2534
01:44:19,500 --> 01:44:20,333
does a,
you should,

2535
01:44:20,990 --> 01:44:22,820
I'll give you a purchases and intro to
doctor Gabriel.

2536
01:44:22,821 --> 01:44:24,940
Marta it,
Brenda don't really know who he is.

2537
01:44:25,590 --> 01:44:27,920
He would be a great guest for you as you
live in England and he lives in

2538
01:44:27,921 --> 01:44:31,540
Vancouver but he comes to La fellows in,
you should definitely talk to you,

2539
01:44:31,580 --> 01:44:32,900
recommend people look it's wet.
But the,

2540
01:44:33,140 --> 01:44:35,210
in terms of just to stay with the last
point about Switzerland,

2541
01:44:35,211 --> 01:44:37,250
because there was something really,
I think it relates to a bike or in a

2542
01:44:37,251 --> 01:44:38,084
way.

2543
01:44:38,090 --> 01:44:40,940
So one of things that really surprised
me and that spending time in that

2544
01:44:40,941 --> 01:44:42,510
clinic,
I remember there's chief psychiatrist,

2545
01:44:42,511 --> 01:44:47,330
they doctor Rita Mangus.
So they will give you as they will give

2546
01:44:47,331 --> 01:44:51,500
you any dose you want except one that
will kill you and there is never any

2547
01:44:51,501 --> 01:44:54,200
pressure to cut back,
which really surprised me.

2548
01:44:54,201 --> 01:44:56,930
So you could go to this clinic and
they'll dose you up with heroin.

2549
01:44:57,090 --> 01:44:59,210
They give you the heroin,
you have to use it there.

2550
01:44:59,270 --> 01:45:00,860
You can't take it out with you because I
don't want them sell it.

2551
01:45:00,861 --> 01:45:02,750
People selling it on.
And also it's kind of bad ass.

2552
01:45:02,780 --> 01:45:04,180
You're monitored by a,
by a,

2553
01:45:04,200 --> 01:45:05,170
by a nurse.
But,

2554
01:45:05,171 --> 01:45:06,530
but the results are pretty incredible.
Right,

2555
01:45:06,590 --> 01:45:07,510
right.
So,

2556
01:45:07,850 --> 01:45:08,320
um,
the,

2557
01:45:08,320 --> 01:45:09,170
well,
the headline,

2558
01:45:09,210 --> 01:45:12,860
most important factors,
there have been zero heroin overdose

2559
01:45:12,861 --> 01:45:16,270
deaths on legal heroin in Switzerland in
the 12 years that program has existed.

2560
01:45:16,280 --> 01:45:20,240
Has the ratio of people using to not
using,

2561
01:45:20,270 --> 01:45:22,670
how's it gone down?
Really significant fall in heroin use

2562
01:45:22,671 --> 01:45:25,930
because of best researchers by Professor
Ambrose Oakton Hargan who's shown there

2563
01:45:25,970 --> 01:45:30,170
been no deaths in the legal program and
an enormous fallen deaths in the illegal

2564
01:45:30,171 --> 01:45:32,150
program and enormous spalding use
overall,

2565
01:45:32,750 --> 01:45:34,900
the various reasons I can talk about.
But the thing that blew my mind was so

2566
01:45:34,901 --> 01:45:36,920
they give them every day as they want
for as long as they want.

2567
01:45:37,340 --> 01:45:37,911
And I was like,
oh,

2568
01:45:37,911 --> 01:45:39,920
but what we're told is that comes back
to chemical hooks.

2569
01:45:40,130 --> 01:45:42,440
What we're told is they'll just want
more and more for ethical.

2570
01:45:42,441 --> 01:45:43,250
Right,
right.

2571
01:45:43,250 --> 01:45:47,390
But actually what happens is almost
everyone chooses to cut back over time

2572
01:45:47,391 --> 01:45:47,931
and stop.
Right?

2573
01:45:47,931 --> 01:45:49,760
When I went in there,
I think there were like two people

2574
01:45:49,761 --> 01:45:52,310
who've been on the program at the stock,
and I said to doctor Manga,

2575
01:45:52,311 --> 01:45:52,640
who runs it?

2576
01:45:52,640 --> 01:45:54,470
I don't understand this.
How is this happening?

2577
01:45:54,860 --> 01:45:56,030
And she looked at me like I was an
idiot,

2578
01:45:56,031 --> 01:45:57,530
and she said,
well,

2579
01:45:58,280 --> 01:46:00,770
people's lives get better and it's their
lives get better.

2580
01:46:00,771 --> 01:46:02,300
They don't want to be anesthetized so
much,

2581
01:46:02,690 --> 01:46:04,910
which seems almost stupidly obvious,
right?

2582
01:46:05,120 --> 01:46:09,310
Goes right back to what you were saying
about antidepressants and people's

2583
01:46:09,320 --> 01:46:12,230
lives,
like the choice that you make and the

2584
01:46:12,231 --> 01:46:15,350
paths that you take and the people you
surround with and the happiness that you

2585
01:46:15,351 --> 01:46:18,500
feel from your community.
That's ultimately what leads to a

2586
01:46:18,501 --> 01:46:21,020
fulfilling life.
And if you have all that,

2587
01:46:21,021 --> 01:46:22,710
why would you fuck it up with heroin?
Right?

2588
01:46:22,790 --> 01:46:27,230
I think you're totally right that the
whole premise of lost connections is

2589
01:46:27,290 --> 01:46:28,910
becomes what song we were saying at the
start,

2590
01:46:29,480 --> 01:46:31,730
human beings have needs,
right?

2591
01:46:32,180 --> 01:46:35,460
And if your needs are being met,
you don't want to be an extra time.

2592
01:46:35,500 --> 01:46:38,810
I think what you said is very important,
that there's psychological needs that

2593
01:46:38,811 --> 01:46:41,630
are just as valuable and important as
physical needs.

2594
01:46:41,631 --> 01:46:43,340
Like we know we have needs for
nutrients,

2595
01:46:43,341 --> 01:46:47,900
we know have needs for water,
we have needs psychological for all

2596
01:46:47,901 --> 01:46:50,160
sorts of different,
our communities

2597
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:53,130
are incredibly important.
Love is incredibly important.

2598
01:46:53,131 --> 01:46:55,740
Family's incredibly important.
You know,

2599
01:46:55,741 --> 01:46:59,110
I know some people that are older men
that uh,

2600
01:46:59,130 --> 01:47:03,570
have been bachelors their whole lives
and their child lists and now they're,

2601
01:47:03,840 --> 01:47:04,890
you know,
they just,

2602
01:47:05,010 --> 01:47:09,300
they don't have a deep connection with
anybody and they get to this very weird,

2603
01:47:09,301 --> 01:47:11,340
strange place where they're like,
is this it?

2604
01:47:11,410 --> 01:47:16,290
Now I'm 70 years old and I've never
really had children and I don't know

2605
01:47:16,291 --> 01:47:19,650
what to do and this is,
this is my life now.

2606
01:47:19,710 --> 01:47:20,600
And it's,
they,

2607
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:23,940
they've,
all their friends have had families now

2608
01:47:23,941 --> 01:47:26,370
and their families,
a lot of times the kids are grown up and

2609
01:47:26,850 --> 01:47:28,470
it becomes very,
very strange.

2610
01:47:28,770 --> 01:47:29,830
No,
I thought about that a lot.

2611
01:47:30,040 --> 01:47:33,670
Intubate this guy and professor John
Kasey Opo at the University of Chicago

2612
01:47:33,671 --> 01:47:35,620
who is the leading expert in the world
on loneliness.

2613
01:47:36,190 --> 01:47:38,380
And he said this thing to me.
So it's a bit like what the woman in

2614
01:47:38,381 --> 01:47:40,960
Geneva suddenly way to live your life
studying.

2615
01:47:41,970 --> 01:47:42,803
They,
uh,

2616
01:47:45,140 --> 01:47:47,890
they had this really interesting,
it's a very simple point,

2617
01:47:48,220 --> 01:47:49,720
but it just said,
if you think about the circumstances

2618
01:47:49,721 --> 01:47:50,800
where we evolved,
right?

2619
01:47:51,250 --> 01:47:53,470
If you got separated from the tribe,
if you were alone,

2620
01:47:53,860 --> 01:47:55,780
you were depressed and anxious for
really fucking good reason.

2621
01:47:55,781 --> 01:47:57,820
You were about to be eaten.
You were in terrible danger.

2622
01:47:57,821 --> 01:47:58,870
If you got injured,
no one would help.

2623
01:47:58,890 --> 01:47:59,820
You would die,
right?

2624
01:48:00,220 --> 01:48:01,970
So all the,
he showed that,

2625
01:48:02,590 --> 01:48:03,490
as you know,
when we're,

2626
01:48:03,580 --> 01:48:06,430
when we're stressed,
we release a hormone called Cortisol.

2627
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:10,480
He showed this wrench to experiment.
They wrote about in the book being

2628
01:48:10,481 --> 01:48:13,930
acutely lonely is a stressful as being
punched in the face by a stranger when

2629
01:48:13,931 --> 01:48:15,460
it comes to cortisol release,
right?

2630
01:48:15,760 --> 01:48:19,390
That's how deeply we are resistant to
loneliness,

2631
01:48:19,430 --> 01:48:21,520
right?
It's a signal telling you to get back to

2632
01:48:21,521 --> 01:48:22,680
the tribe.
That's why we bought,

2633
01:48:22,700 --> 01:48:25,750
it's a really important signal.
If humans hadn't had that signal,

2634
01:48:25,751 --> 01:48:26,950
we wouldn't be here.
Right?

2635
01:48:27,400 --> 01:48:28,720
Um,
and I think you're right.

2636
01:48:28,721 --> 01:48:30,130
So when you look at these,
these men,

2637
01:48:30,880 --> 01:48:34,500
if you have an isolated,
there was this woman,

2638
01:48:34,690 --> 01:48:38,350
so I covered this incredible protest
movement happened in Berlin on a big

2639
01:48:38,351 --> 01:48:42,130
anonymous housing project when no one
knew each other and they came together

2640
01:48:42,131 --> 01:48:44,200
to protest.
It was a woman who was about to kill

2641
01:48:44,201 --> 01:48:45,700
herself because she was about to be
evicted.

2642
01:48:46,240 --> 01:48:49,330
And the whole housing project came
together to say she should be allowed to

2643
01:48:49,331 --> 01:48:51,670
stay in our home and they should have a
rent freeze.

2644
01:48:52,180 --> 01:48:54,280
And it's an amazing story.
I'll tell it in the book,

2645
01:48:54,281 --> 01:48:57,190
but there's something,
one of the women said to me that I never

2646
01:48:57,191 --> 01:48:59,080
forgot it was called narrow man.

2647
01:48:59,500 --> 01:49:01,840
She grown up in Turkey and she come to
Germany,

2648
01:49:01,841 --> 01:49:04,810
I think when she was 17 she said,
when I grew up in Turkey,

2649
01:49:05,560 --> 01:49:08,200
well I called my home was my village and
everyone in it.

2650
01:49:08,770 --> 01:49:11,560
And then I came to live in the Western
world and I learned that what you're

2651
01:49:11,561 --> 01:49:14,800
meant to call home is just your four
walls and if you're lucky,

2652
01:49:14,801 --> 01:49:19,630
your family.
And then this protest began and we all

2653
01:49:19,631 --> 01:49:23,320
got to know each other.
And this whole place became my home and

2654
01:49:23,321 --> 01:49:26,010
I think everywhere here is home now.
And,

2655
01:49:26,270 --> 01:49:27,460
and,
and she realized that,

2656
01:49:28,090 --> 01:49:30,580
that we are homeless in some sense in
the western world.

2657
01:49:30,830 --> 01:49:33,550
The US humans have a need for a sense of
belonging.

2658
01:49:34,270 --> 01:49:37,900
And our sense of home is too small to
meet our sense of belonging.

2659
01:49:38,090 --> 01:49:41,020
There's a wonderful,
a Bosnian writer called Alexander Heyman

2660
01:49:41,260 --> 01:49:42,530
who said,
um,

2661
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,100
home is where people notice when you're
not there.

2662
01:49:45,670 --> 01:49:48,540
Right?
And a lot of like these guys you're

2663
01:49:48,550 --> 01:49:50,230
talking about is all the guys who
notices if they're not,

2664
01:49:50,310 --> 01:49:53,170
they're probably no one probably are in
a sense homeless,

2665
01:49:53,320 --> 01:49:55,270
right?
They'll spiritually homeless.

2666
01:49:55,720 --> 01:49:56,610
And um,
I said,

2667
01:49:56,611 --> 01:49:58,000
that's it.
I'm not a religious person.

2668
01:49:58,001 --> 01:49:59,030
I don't mean that.
Yeah.

2669
01:49:59,070 --> 01:50:01,390
He'd go through saying,
you know what I mean?

2670
01:50:01,960 --> 01:50:05,620
And so I think it's about,
and this comes back to think about how

2671
01:50:05,621 --> 01:50:08,200
different that is,
what everything we're talking about,

2672
01:50:08,201 --> 01:50:11,170
they can have different,
our conversation has been to what my

2673
01:50:11,171 --> 01:50:15,550
doctor told me when I was a teenager.
And I go in and I say I'm in real pain

2674
01:50:15,551 --> 01:50:17,080
and I feel like pain is leaking out at
me.

2675
01:50:17,081 --> 01:50:18,880
And I can't control it.
And he says,

2676
01:50:19,060 --> 01:50:20,590
you've just got a malfunction in your
brain.

2677
01:50:20,710 --> 01:50:22,840
Right?
What are the worst things about that?

2678
01:50:22,841 --> 01:50:23,860
There are many things wrong with that.

2679
01:50:23,860 --> 01:50:25,420
Firstly,
what he said to me is not true.

2680
01:50:25,960 --> 01:50:27,010
Um,
uh,

2681
01:50:27,011 --> 01:50:29,150
I'm sure he believed it.
I think he was misinformed that I think

2682
01:50:29,160 --> 01:50:31,910
he was deliberately lying to me,
but what he said was not true.

2683
01:50:31,911 --> 01:50:34,450
But also to me,
the biggest problem with just telling

2684
01:50:34,451 --> 01:50:37,600
this exclusively biological story about
depression and anxiety.

2685
01:50:37,601 --> 01:50:39,460
There's some real biological factors of
course,

2686
01:50:40,060 --> 01:50:42,430
is it cuts us off from having this
conversation,

2687
01:50:42,431 --> 01:50:44,230
right?
All those people you were talking about

2688
01:50:44,231 --> 01:50:47,920
who I was so insistent as I was to that
depression is just the result of a

2689
01:50:47,921 --> 01:50:51,670
chemical imbalance.
If you think that it disconnects you

2690
01:50:51,671 --> 01:50:54,910
from the source of your pain,
it tells you your just biologically

2691
01:50:54,911 --> 01:50:58,630
broken and presumably always going to be
biologically broken when the

2692
01:50:58,631 --> 01:51:01,240
conversation we're having,
which is a different conversation.

2693
01:51:01,241 --> 01:51:03,760
It's a difficult conversation,
is a nuanced conversation.

2694
01:51:03,970 --> 01:51:06,850
It's not simplistic.
It's not one problem,

2695
01:51:06,910 --> 01:51:08,140
one lever to solve it.

2696
01:51:08,140 --> 01:51:10,780
It's a much deeper and more,
uh,

2697
01:51:10,960 --> 01:51:14,530
textured way of thinking.
That is the conversation we have to

2698
01:51:14,531 --> 01:51:15,880
have.
That's what the best scientists in the

2699
01:51:15,881 --> 01:51:18,220
world are telling us.
The World Health Organization and my

2700
01:51:18,221 --> 01:51:19,950
worry is,
um,

2701
01:51:20,170 --> 01:51:21,580
we're just being pushed in it.
Like you said,

2702
01:51:21,581 --> 01:51:21,920
that,
that,

2703
01:51:21,920 --> 01:51:25,090
that broken metaphor about driving 37
miles in the wrong direction.

2704
01:51:25,091 --> 01:51:26,860
Right?
We're just driving in the wrong

2705
01:51:26,861 --> 01:51:28,660
direction.
We're driving away from the source of

2706
01:51:28,661 --> 01:51:32,380
our pain rather than towards it where it
can be understood and solved.

2707
01:51:32,590 --> 01:51:33,910
Of course,
it's always going to be some pain in

2708
01:51:33,911 --> 01:51:36,550
human life,
but the fact that we have this one in

2709
01:51:36,551 --> 01:51:38,770
five people taking a psychiatric drug,
you know,

2710
01:51:39,420 --> 01:51:44,420
I think the figure is one in 10 13 year
old boys is taking a stimulant drug to

2711
01:51:44,531 --> 01:51:48,070
make them focus.
I think the figure is 30% of old people

2712
01:51:48,071 --> 01:51:49,930
in,
in retirement homes have been given

2713
01:51:49,931 --> 01:51:52,990
antipsychotic drugs to shut them the
fuck up because they're rebelling

2714
01:51:52,991 --> 01:51:54,190
against the way they're being treated.

2715
01:51:54,490 --> 01:51:57,730
In between one in four middle aged women
in the United States is taking a

2716
01:51:57,731 --> 01:52:00,280
chemical anti depressant at any given
time.

2717
01:52:00,620 --> 01:52:02,110
One in four,
one in four.

2718
01:52:02,590 --> 01:52:04,840
You're talking about that a society
that,

2719
01:52:04,930 --> 01:52:07,390
I mean the figures about how many
children is much lower,

2720
01:52:07,391 --> 01:52:11,140
but it's so much more extreme.
The F number at number toddlers who have

2721
01:52:11,141 --> 01:52:14,920
been given antipsychotics in the United
States is just off the scale.

2722
01:52:14,921 --> 01:52:15,860
Right.
Um,

2723
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,040
I think doctor Sammie to Mimi has
written about this,

2724
01:52:18,220 --> 01:52:20,470
there's some extraordinary figure,
I'm not getting figure slightly wrong,

2725
01:52:20,471 --> 01:52:24,730
but it's something like a majority of
children in foster care in the United

2726
01:52:24,730 --> 01:52:28,210
States are being given stimulant drugs
basically to shut them up.

2727
01:52:28,300 --> 01:52:29,170
Yeah,
that's,

2728
01:52:29,200 --> 01:52:33,340
that's a disturbing one.
The ritalin and rarely various

2729
01:52:33,341 --> 01:52:35,860
stimulants that they give to children.
Um,

2730
01:52:36,280 --> 01:52:38,500
what's that about?
What's the cause of that?

2731
01:52:38,920 --> 01:52:41,110
Well,
I think it's related to research as much

2732
01:52:41,111 --> 01:52:42,410
less than the other things we've talked
about.

2733
01:52:43,040 --> 01:52:45,250
But from it,
it came up a lot in the conversations

2734
01:52:45,260 --> 01:52:48,110
that I had.
There are many things going on here.

2735
01:52:48,710 --> 01:52:50,480
One of them is,
um,

2736
01:52:51,080 --> 01:52:53,210
a lot of the,
so a lot of the,

2737
01:52:53,330 --> 01:52:55,970
not all of them,
a lot of the causes of depression and

2738
01:52:55,971 --> 01:52:58,790
anxiety that I wrote about,
I couldn't help but notice reading all

2739
01:52:58,791 --> 01:53:02,540
the research into being the scientists
also can lead to,

2740
01:53:02,790 --> 01:53:05,240
um,
decrease in focus and attention.

2741
01:53:05,450 --> 01:53:08,780
So for example,
if you are dead end at work and you,

2742
01:53:08,810 --> 01:53:11,150
you feel controlled all the time,
you have to deaden yourself to get

2743
01:53:11,151 --> 01:53:13,940
through it.
It's harder attention's a muscle,

2744
01:53:13,941 --> 01:53:16,310
right?
It's harder to bring your brain back to

2745
01:53:16,311 --> 01:53:18,290
focus.
Like Joe wanted to just go and collapse

2746
01:53:18,291 --> 01:53:19,280
and watch,
you know,

2747
01:53:19,340 --> 01:53:21,530
watch whatever shit was on the bachelor
or whatever.

2748
01:53:21,880 --> 01:53:24,200
I would watch the bachelor actually,
whatever shit would have been on the

2749
01:53:24,220 --> 01:53:26,310
[inaudible] on the TV.
Um,

2750
01:53:26,330 --> 01:53:28,730
so one is full state of depression in
the bathroom.

2751
01:53:30,890 --> 01:53:34,310
He was prepared to take oxy but not to
go to that level of self harm.

2752
01:53:34,311 --> 01:53:35,144
Right?
But the,

2753
01:53:35,450 --> 01:53:37,340
but the,
or think about loneliness,

2754
01:53:37,341 --> 01:53:39,380
right?
There's really pressed casio potion.

2755
01:53:39,490 --> 01:53:41,210
This,
if you are lonely,

2756
01:53:41,690 --> 01:53:43,490
that triggers what's called hyper
vigilance,

2757
01:53:43,491 --> 01:53:44,301
right?
Again,

2758
01:53:44,301 --> 01:53:46,610
for very good reason.
If you're on your own in the savannas of

2759
01:53:46,611 --> 01:53:47,760
Africa,
right?

2760
01:53:47,810 --> 01:53:49,130
You want to be hypervigilant,
of course.

2761
01:53:49,160 --> 01:53:50,780
So you find it,
one of the things it was most

2762
01:53:50,781 --> 01:53:55,781
challenging to me is this evidence that
the people with the lowest levels of

2763
01:53:56,091 --> 01:53:59,720
attention problems and depression and
anxiety in the United States or the

2764
01:53:59,721 --> 01:54:00,680
amish,
right.

2765
01:54:00,920 --> 01:54:04,220
And I am a atheist,
gay liberal.

2766
01:54:04,310 --> 01:54:06,770
So the idea of going,
it's like learning something from the

2767
01:54:06,771 --> 01:54:08,690
Amish was initially challenging to me.
And I've got a mare,

2768
01:54:09,320 --> 01:54:11,280
I felt really humbled by going and
spending time with,

2769
01:54:11,290 --> 01:54:12,900
I went to this village called
[inaudible],

2770
01:54:13,190 --> 01:54:15,680
which is just outside of Fort Wayne,
Indiana.

2771
01:54:16,460 --> 01:54:19,310
And you know,
there's still a lot I disagree with

2772
01:54:19,311 --> 01:54:20,540
about the Amish.
Don't get me wrong,

2773
01:54:20,780 --> 01:54:22,220
not least cause I just rewatched
witness,

2774
01:54:22,250 --> 01:54:23,083
but,
uh,

2775
01:54:23,100 --> 01:54:24,810
the,
but,

2776
01:54:25,070 --> 01:54:26,790
but you know,
they,

2777
01:54:26,840 --> 01:54:29,020
I could see that they've got,
so it's very interesting about the army.

2778
01:54:29,021 --> 01:54:29,854
She's,
you know,

2779
01:54:30,110 --> 01:54:32,060
when you turn 16,
if you're an amish,

2780
01:54:32,120 --> 01:54:35,030
you've got to leave and go and live in
what they call the English world,

2781
01:54:35,031 --> 01:54:35,864
our world.
Right.

2782
01:54:36,170 --> 01:54:38,930
And then you decide whether it's come
back about 80% decide to come back.

2783
01:54:38,931 --> 01:54:41,200
20% don't.
It's one of the reasons why the amish is

2784
01:54:41,210 --> 01:54:44,180
never counted as a cult because no cult
would do that right now.

2785
01:54:44,181 --> 01:54:46,250
Call.
It's going to tell you to leave for two

2786
01:54:46,251 --> 01:54:48,110
years and then decide whether to come
back to the fact that the exact

2787
01:54:48,111 --> 01:54:50,450
opposite.
So they have lived in our world,

2788
01:54:50,451 --> 01:54:51,980
they know our world really well.

2789
01:54:52,160 --> 01:54:53,990
And even having this very challenging
conversation with,

2790
01:54:54,020 --> 01:54:55,340
um,
what's his name?

2791
01:54:55,341 --> 01:54:58,520
Lauren beachy.
His name is an amish guy there who said

2792
01:54:58,820 --> 01:55:00,680
there cyber,
because back to the weight conversation

2793
01:55:00,681 --> 01:55:01,970
we had,
he said,

2794
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:03,770
um,
but there's loads of things I miss.

2795
01:55:03,771 --> 01:55:05,510
He talked about missing that seventies
show.

2796
01:55:05,780 --> 01:55:08,150
He said,
I used to love driving in trucks because

2797
01:55:08,151 --> 01:55:10,460
they obviously don't drive that ultra
steer off the grid.

2798
01:55:11,300 --> 01:55:12,350
And he said,
but you know,

2799
01:55:12,351 --> 01:55:15,530
if I kept those things,
I wouldn't spend time with my family.

2800
01:55:15,650 --> 01:55:17,060
I wouldn't spend time with my children.
I wouldn't,

2801
01:55:17,230 --> 01:55:20,160
I wouldn't know who my neighbors were.
And we said the spreadsheet,

2802
01:55:20,161 --> 01:55:21,020
angelic thing,
he said,

2803
01:55:21,380 --> 01:55:22,400
you know,
weight watchers.

2804
01:55:22,401 --> 01:55:23,090
And I said,
yeah.

2805
01:55:23,090 --> 01:55:23,923
And he said,
well,

2806
01:55:23,930 --> 01:55:26,600
the idea of weight watchers is you can
only lose weight together as a group,

2807
01:55:26,601 --> 01:55:27,770
right?
It helps or not only,

2808
01:55:27,771 --> 01:55:30,710
but it helps you to lose weight together
as a group that you would find it harder

2809
01:55:30,711 --> 01:55:32,810
on your own.
This is like that.

2810
01:55:32,811 --> 01:55:34,550
And I said,
what are you saying about the amish is

2811
01:55:34,551 --> 01:55:37,310
like weight watchers for the problems of
Western civilization?

2812
01:55:37,580 --> 01:55:38,413
And he's like,
yeah,

2813
01:55:38,570 --> 01:55:41,030
that's what I'm saying.
And to me that was so challenging.

2814
01:55:41,031 --> 01:55:43,820
The idea that you've got to give,
because we comes back to what is there a

2815
01:55:43,900 --> 01:55:47,010
junk news in our culture,
we told the solution is always to get

2816
01:55:47,011 --> 01:55:49,410
more.
And the idea that the solution is to

2817
01:55:49,411 --> 01:55:53,250
have less and be present more is really
challenging.

2818
01:55:53,251 --> 01:55:53,890
Right?

2819
01:55:53,890 --> 01:55:55,510
I don't even think it's about having
less,

2820
01:55:55,511 --> 01:55:57,790
it's about what they're doing is look,
eat,

2821
01:55:57,791 --> 01:56:00,370
think about what the amish are doing.
First of all,

2822
01:56:00,520 --> 01:56:02,170
massive sense of community,
right?

2823
01:56:02,350 --> 01:56:04,780
They're very connected.
They're not using cell phones and not

2824
01:56:04,781 --> 01:56:07,690
using email.
So the community is also based on one to

2825
01:56:07,691 --> 01:56:10,120
one interaction,
real social cues,

2826
01:56:10,121 --> 01:56:12,100
real social interaction,
which is critical.

2827
01:56:12,310 --> 01:56:15,550
It's a big part of being a human being
and it's one of the more apps and things

2828
01:56:15,551 --> 01:56:20,200
in modern society to physical labor.
They're involved in a lot of physical

2829
01:56:20,201 --> 01:56:22,090
labor because they don't use
electricity,

2830
01:56:22,091 --> 01:56:24,970
they don't use power tools.
There's so many things that they don't

2831
01:56:24,971 --> 01:56:27,070
do,
so because of their culture,

2832
01:56:27,071 --> 01:56:29,110
they're making their own homes.
All right,

2833
01:56:29,260 --> 01:56:32,110
so they have a vested interest in
helping each other,

2834
01:56:32,111 --> 01:56:35,590
working together as a community and they
have a deep sense of satisfaction of

2835
01:56:35,920 --> 01:56:38,170
constructing each other's homes.

2836
01:56:38,350 --> 01:56:41,860
You construct my home with me,
I help you build your home.

2837
01:56:42,040 --> 01:56:45,100
They take care of their animals,
they take care of their crops,

2838
01:56:45,101 --> 01:56:48,310
they take theirs.
There's a real connection with where

2839
01:56:48,311 --> 01:56:52,220
they get their food from.
A real connection with where they live,

2840
01:56:52,221 --> 01:56:55,470
their community,
the sense of just the whole,

2841
01:56:55,480 --> 01:56:58,540
the sense of belonging to something
that's bigger than you.

2842
01:56:58,840 --> 01:57:01,660
It's a,
there's so many factors involved in

2843
01:57:01,661 --> 01:57:04,780
their happiness that you can kind of see
where it,

2844
01:57:04,781 --> 01:57:06,800
yeah,
there's a lot of wacky shit with the,

2845
01:57:06,810 --> 01:57:09,970
the cult aspects of,
of being an amish person.

2846
01:57:09,971 --> 01:57:14,230
But what you get out of it,
it's almost like if you had a self help

2847
01:57:14,231 --> 01:57:18,700
group that subscribed to all the
positive benefits of being amish and

2848
01:57:18,701 --> 01:57:21,880
they just called it like regrounding or
something like that.

2849
01:57:21,881 --> 01:57:25,570
And you just go out there and you become
a part of nature and make mean that's,

2850
01:57:25,571 --> 01:57:28,630
that seems like a co op.
And it seems like some sort of a farm

2851
01:57:28,631 --> 01:57:29,850
based CO-OP,
right?

2852
01:57:30,020 --> 01:57:32,770
Yeah.
Bill each other's houses stay together.

2853
01:57:32,860 --> 01:57:35,740
You don't have to wear sexy clothes.
Let's just all wear the same shit.

2854
01:57:35,760 --> 01:57:36,593
It's no big deal.

2855
01:57:36,690 --> 01:57:38,010
I love how you put that in it.
You're right.

2856
01:57:38,280 --> 01:57:40,620
So the inequality,
the richest Dharmesh is as wealthy as

2857
01:57:40,621 --> 01:57:42,840
the forest,
but it's essentially as well,

2858
01:57:42,841 --> 01:57:45,570
cause it's not like they're not holding
them back.

2859
01:57:45,960 --> 01:57:49,500
I think that's one of the things that I
think about this in relation to

2860
01:57:49,501 --> 01:57:53,580
attention is,
so there's this theory that amish kids

2861
01:57:53,581 --> 01:57:55,290
don't seem to develop Adhd,
right?

2862
01:57:55,291 --> 01:57:57,720
And there's been,
it's been surprisingly understudied

2863
01:57:58,080 --> 01:58:00,900
[inaudible] doctors.
I mean that's the problem for kids are

2864
01:58:00,901 --> 01:58:04,400
bouncing off the wall and he's adorable.
I don't think it's that.

2865
01:58:04,401 --> 01:58:05,940
I,
I wondered if it was that and I would

2866
01:58:05,941 --> 01:58:08,370
say about it if it was like they don't
have electronics and then obviously I'm

2867
01:58:08,371 --> 01:58:09,630
kidding.
I don't think there's an element going

2868
01:58:09,631 --> 01:58:12,720
on there.
But actually the main thing is when I

2869
01:58:12,721 --> 01:58:15,000
spoke to them they said,
yeah,

2870
01:58:15,001 --> 01:58:17,370
we've got some kids who don't want to
concentrate and sit in school,

2871
01:58:17,371 --> 01:58:19,610
but so we just let them run around and
go fishing and hunting and state.

2872
01:58:19,620 --> 01:58:20,890
Right.
And so many brands,

2873
01:58:20,950 --> 01:58:22,860
right?
So there's always going to be,

2874
01:58:23,020 --> 01:58:25,410
there may be factors making it harder
for us to concentrate in the

2875
01:58:25,411 --> 01:58:26,370
environment.
I think there are,

2876
01:58:26,730 --> 01:58:29,250
but there's always going to be a natural
variation in people who want to sit and

2877
01:58:29,251 --> 01:58:31,020
focus on one thing compared to people
who want to,

2878
01:58:31,350 --> 01:58:33,000
you know,
run around medically.

2879
01:58:33,001 --> 01:58:35,640
And that's actually,
you can see how as a species it benefits

2880
01:58:35,641 --> 01:58:36,660
us to have both,
right?

2881
01:58:37,740 --> 01:58:42,740
But what we do is we try to bash every
child into one particular mode of being,

2882
01:58:43,990 --> 01:58:46,690
of course,
actually is designed to prepare them for

2883
01:58:46,691 --> 01:58:48,730
Shitty deadening work.
The reason our schools are shitty and

2884
01:58:48,731 --> 01:58:50,780
deadening does a,
a guy called Alfie cone,

2885
01:58:50,781 --> 01:58:54,220
he says every school has an official
curriculum and a hidden curriculum.

2886
01:58:54,610 --> 01:58:56,710
The official curriculum is like history,
geography,

2887
01:58:56,711 --> 01:58:59,050
whatever.
And the hidden curriculum is,

2888
01:58:59,200 --> 01:59:01,900
this is what we're training you to put
up with in your life,

2889
01:59:01,960 --> 01:59:02,793
right?

2890
01:59:02,830 --> 01:59:07,180
And if you've got a society where 87% of
people don't like their work and you're

2891
01:59:07,181 --> 01:59:09,550
more twice as likely,
almost twice as likely to hate your job

2892
01:59:09,551 --> 01:59:10,384
as love,
your job,

2893
01:59:10,630 --> 01:59:13,990
part of the job of the school system
will be to deaden children.

2894
01:59:14,200 --> 01:59:16,630
So they learn,
you've got to fucking sit there and shut

2895
01:59:16,631 --> 01:59:18,490
up and do what you're told,
right?

2896
01:59:18,670 --> 01:59:20,410
So that's not a malfunction of the
system.

2897
01:59:20,411 --> 01:59:22,240
That's an unconscious functions of the
system,

2898
01:59:22,241 --> 01:59:23,850
right?
So we,

2899
01:59:23,950 --> 01:59:25,390
we,
we've got this system where we're

2900
01:59:25,391 --> 01:59:28,510
bashing these kids to prepare them for
this economic system that's making us

2901
01:59:28,511 --> 01:59:30,100
feel miserable.
To me,

2902
01:59:30,101 --> 01:59:32,800
the solution is to change the way we
work so we don't have to fucking dead

2903
01:59:32,801 --> 01:59:33,790
and our children,
right?

2904
01:59:33,950 --> 01:59:36,640
So actually our children can be a bit,
but the arm issue,

2905
01:59:36,641 --> 01:59:37,210
who,
you know,

2906
01:59:37,210 --> 01:59:38,830
do as you say,
it's not like they're doing

2907
01:59:41,020 --> 01:59:43,720
high end cognitive labor is,
will be the fancy way of putting it,

2908
01:59:43,721 --> 01:59:44,020
right?

2909
01:59:44,020 --> 01:59:44,860
But the,
the,

2910
01:59:44,861 --> 01:59:47,980
the,
their kids to them having a kid who goes

2911
01:59:47,981 --> 01:59:49,720
fishing and running around,
it's normal.

2912
01:59:49,750 --> 01:59:53,110
It's as valuable actually as you may
even be more valuable than the kid who

2913
01:59:53,111 --> 01:59:54,530
sits there reading.
Right?

2914
01:59:54,850 --> 01:59:55,780
Because actually,
so,

2915
01:59:56,140 --> 01:59:57,820
um,
I think there's a real thing about this,

2916
01:59:57,821 --> 01:59:59,740
what that tells us,
it comes back to one of the themes

2917
01:59:59,741 --> 02:00:01,000
that's come up all through our
conversation,

2918
02:00:01,001 --> 02:00:03,640
Joe,
these things that we're told our

2919
02:00:03,641 --> 02:00:06,700
pathologies make sense in their
contexts,

2920
02:00:06,701 --> 02:00:07,930
right?
Depression,

2921
02:00:07,931 --> 02:00:09,970
we're told it's a pathology.
Actually,

2922
02:00:10,120 --> 02:00:12,760
anxiety with tides project actually is
largely,

2923
02:00:12,790 --> 02:00:15,430
not entirely,
but largely a response to things going

2924
02:00:15,431 --> 02:00:17,500
wrong.
We're told addiction is a pathology.

2925
02:00:17,501 --> 02:00:20,620
It's a response to things happening.
We're told that obesity is a pathology.

2926
02:00:20,621 --> 02:00:22,510
In some cases it's a response to things
going wrong.

2927
02:00:22,690 --> 02:00:25,720
We told the kids not wanting to be able
to focus as a pathology in adults not

2928
02:00:25,721 --> 02:00:26,554
being able to focus.

2929
02:00:26,860 --> 02:00:29,380
I think we need to understand that these
things have meaning.

2930
02:00:29,560 --> 02:00:31,000
They make sense,
right?

2931
02:00:31,030 --> 02:00:33,940
It doesn't mean they're good most,
it's clearly not good to be a basis,

2932
02:00:33,970 --> 02:00:36,370
clearly not good to be addicted
obviously,

2933
02:00:36,640 --> 02:00:38,410
but if you understand that they make
sense.

2934
02:00:38,411 --> 02:00:42,730
That opens up a totally different way of
responding to them once that actually

2935
02:00:42,731 --> 02:00:43,630
fucking work.
Right.

2936
02:00:43,750 --> 02:00:45,820
The places that I think about the drug
war,

2937
02:00:45,821 --> 02:00:49,810
right for chasing the scream by book
about addiction and the drug war.

2938
02:00:49,840 --> 02:00:54,070
I went out with a group of women in
Arizona in that prison run by that

2939
02:00:54,071 --> 02:00:57,010
fucking psychopath Joe Arpaio,
who I also interviewed who trump

2940
02:00:57,011 --> 02:00:59,830
pardoned.
How the fuck did he pardon that guy?

2941
02:01:02,620 --> 02:01:05,330
Don't get me started on that.
About this deeply.

2942
02:01:05,740 --> 02:01:06,491
I,
it's funny,

2943
02:01:06,491 --> 02:01:08,710
I can tell you about Joe Arpaio cause a
in a funny sort of way.

2944
02:01:08,711 --> 02:01:10,030
I felt very sorry for him.
But anyway,

2945
02:01:10,420 --> 02:01:15,220
I went out on this group of,
with this group of women who are made to

2946
02:01:15,221 --> 02:01:18,700
go out on a chain gang wearing tee
shirts saying I was a drug addict where

2947
02:01:18,701 --> 02:01:20,800
members of the public mock them and
jared them.

2948
02:01:20,801 --> 02:01:22,450
Right.
And

2949
02:01:24,310 --> 02:01:27,670
I remember going back to the prison with
them is called tent city.

2950
02:01:28,540 --> 02:01:31,420
And the women were terrified is
something called the hole,

2951
02:01:31,421 --> 02:01:33,070
which is where you were sent if you
fucked up.

2952
02:01:33,071 --> 02:01:36,280
Right.
And I said to the gods,

2953
02:01:36,310 --> 02:01:39,040
we take me to see the whole,
and I've been in a lot reporting from

2954
02:01:39,050 --> 02:01:40,160
prisons and God's always

2955
02:01:40,160 --> 02:01:43,340
don't want to show you the bad things in
this one cause it's a fucking pantomime

2956
02:01:43,341 --> 02:01:45,710
of cruelty.
They want you to see it.

2957
02:01:45,750 --> 02:01:47,180
Right?
So they took me to the hole.

2958
02:01:47,181 --> 02:01:49,040
It was in fact a whole,
it's a concrete cell,

2959
02:01:49,041 --> 02:01:52,070
bare concrete cell with nothing in it,
no TV,

2960
02:01:52,071 --> 02:01:53,720
nothing.
Um,

2961
02:01:54,200 --> 02:01:56,080
and I saw this woman in there who was
like,

2962
02:01:56,150 --> 02:02:00,320
she saw my face through that was just so
desperate to be a human being who wasn't

2963
02:02:00,321 --> 02:02:02,750
one of these guards.
She'd been there for a month.

2964
02:02:02,810 --> 02:02:05,240
And I remember the audio is actually on
the chasing the scream website.

2965
02:02:05,241 --> 02:02:10,241
I'm chasing the scream.com and I
remember looking in the cell and

2966
02:02:10,641 --> 02:02:14,000
thinking,
this is the closest you could get to a

2967
02:02:14,001 --> 02:02:18,800
literal human reenactment of the cages
that guaranteed addiction in rats.

2968
02:02:19,310 --> 02:02:21,680
And this is what we're doing,
thinking it will stop this woman from

2969
02:02:21,681 --> 02:02:25,580
being addicted all the places which had
approaches based on punishment and shame

2970
02:02:25,581 --> 02:02:26,600
towards these things.

2971
02:02:26,870 --> 02:02:28,430
It's sometimes people say,
Oh,

2972
02:02:28,431 --> 02:02:30,890
punishing people with addiction problems
doesn't work.

2973
02:02:31,460 --> 02:02:34,550
That's way too soft on it.
It makes the problem worse,

2974
02:02:34,610 --> 02:02:37,220
right?
Those women go in fucking broken,

2975
02:02:37,221 --> 02:02:39,650
devastated,
then they're even more broken and

2976
02:02:39,651 --> 02:02:41,510
devastated.
They go out even more fucking addicted.

2977
02:02:41,511 --> 02:02:44,000
Right?
So reason why Portugal has massively for

2978
02:02:44,120 --> 02:02:47,120
portrait in Switzerland have massively
falling addiction problems and the

2979
02:02:47,121 --> 02:02:49,640
United States have massively increasing
one's right.

2980
02:02:50,120 --> 02:02:52,730
So to me,
again,

2981
02:02:52,790 --> 02:02:57,740
the evidence is approaches towards these
problem that are based on compassion

2982
02:02:58,160 --> 02:02:59,740
connection,
uh,

2983
02:02:59,840 --> 02:03:01,850
love,
understanding,

2984
02:03:01,880 --> 02:03:04,880
seeing that it makes sense work.
They're not magic bullets.

2985
02:03:04,881 --> 02:03:06,710
There's still gonna be problems in
anything we do.

2986
02:03:07,270 --> 02:03:12,270
And approach is based on shame and
stigma and rage and just condemning

2987
02:03:13,071 --> 02:03:14,660
people.
Um,

2988
02:03:15,410 --> 02:03:17,690
they just make the problem worse.
Yeah.

2989
02:03:17,691 --> 02:03:20,540
There's no doubt about that.
And there's also no doubt about what you

2990
02:03:20,541 --> 02:03:23,720
were speaking about when you started
that rant about schools.

2991
02:03:24,120 --> 02:03:25,970
Yeah.
About schools where children trying to

2992
02:03:25,971 --> 02:03:30,971
fit them into these,
these very convenient categories and

2993
02:03:31,160 --> 02:03:34,070
trying to get them to get comfortable
with doing things that they don't want

2994
02:03:34,071 --> 02:03:36,500
to do that.
That's great.

2995
02:03:36,530 --> 02:03:39,320
If we're,
we've resigned ourselves to turning

2996
02:03:39,321 --> 02:03:42,170
children into work robots.
I love that way of putting it.

2997
02:03:42,171 --> 02:03:43,070
He just said,
that's brilliant.

2998
02:03:43,071 --> 02:03:45,450
Yeah.
It shouldn't really ramping it.

2999
02:03:45,590 --> 02:03:47,090
Oh look,
I went through that myself.

3000
02:03:47,120 --> 02:03:49,370
I thought it was a fool when I was in
high school.

3001
02:03:49,371 --> 02:03:50,870
I was like,
there's gotta be something wrong with

3002
02:03:50,871 --> 02:03:51,860
me.
I can't concentrate.

3003
02:03:51,861 --> 02:03:54,680
I can't do it.
I'm never going to be good at anything.

3004
02:03:54,740 --> 02:03:57,320
I was like,
I'm just going to resign myself to be an

3005
02:03:57,321 --> 02:03:59,660
outcast.
I'm going to resign myself to be a loser

3006
02:03:59,990 --> 02:04:02,450
because I just couldn't sit still in
class.

3007
02:04:02,451 --> 02:04:04,490
I couldn't pay attention.
I didn't want to do the homework.

3008
02:04:04,670 --> 02:04:08,690
I was bored out of my fucking mind and I
didn't even realize there was anything

3009
02:04:08,780 --> 02:04:12,830
that I could do that I would be
intellectually curious about.

3010
02:04:13,130 --> 02:04:13,581
I mean,
I just,

3011
02:04:13,581 --> 02:04:15,890
I didn't think that that was a part of
my life.

3012
02:04:15,891 --> 02:04:20,090
I didn't think I was a curious person
and it was just merely because I was

3013
02:04:20,091 --> 02:04:23,270
being forced to do a bunch of shit that
I didn't want to do and it tainted my

3014
02:04:23,271 --> 02:04:27,980
idea of learning and when I got out of
school and then when I started reading

3015
02:04:27,981 --> 02:04:30,200
books just for my own amusement and an
interest,

3016
02:04:30,201 --> 02:04:31,160
then I realize,
oh,

3017
02:04:31,220 --> 02:04:33,890
I'm a very curious person.
I just,

3018
02:04:34,370 --> 02:04:36,740
I just didn't want to do what they
wanted me to do.

3019
02:04:36,741 --> 02:04:38,040
I didn't want to study what

3020
02:04:38,040 --> 02:04:41,460
they wanted me to study and I didn't
want to be stuck in some room with some

3021
02:04:41,461 --> 02:04:45,780
person who was under motivated and
really didn't have any understanding of

3022
02:04:45,781 --> 02:04:48,180
how to deal with children.
It was the rare person,

3023
02:04:48,181 --> 02:04:51,720
one out of five when I was six teachers
that would come along that would give

3024
02:04:51,721 --> 02:04:55,080
you like some spark of happiness and
love and you'd go like,

3025
02:04:55,130 --> 02:04:56,550
Oh,
this class is pretty cool.

3026
02:04:56,670 --> 02:04:58,030
That's a good teacher.
Like Oh,

3027
02:04:58,031 --> 02:04:59,240
she's nice,
you know,

3028
02:04:59,250 --> 02:05:00,990
he's fun.
And it was rare.

3029
02:05:01,050 --> 02:05:04,440
It was very rare.
Most of the time it was a dull grind and

3030
02:05:04,620 --> 02:05:09,090
I would wake up with nightmares after
I'd graduated that I'd fucked up and

3031
02:05:09,091 --> 02:05:11,670
didn't get the right amount of credits
and I had to go back to school.

3032
02:05:12,060 --> 02:05:16,140
I would have crazy nightmares that it
would have to repeat the 12th grade and

3033
02:05:16,141 --> 02:05:19,230
go back to school because I just,
it was soul sucking.

3034
02:05:19,500 --> 02:05:22,770
And to me it represented the future
because the future was going to be more

3035
02:05:22,771 --> 02:05:26,370
soul sucking because you're going to be
working 40 hours a week plus overtime

3036
02:05:26,430 --> 02:05:29,190
doing something that you hated and this
is what you had to do if you wanted to

3037
02:05:29,191 --> 02:05:32,880
get by in this slide.
And that is what was presented to me.

3038
02:05:33,170 --> 02:05:34,920
And that's what's presented to a lot of
people.

3039
02:05:34,921 --> 02:05:37,620
And if you take that and keep going with
it,

3040
02:05:37,860 --> 02:05:40,530
you eventually become that guy who was
in that job.

3041
02:05:40,531 --> 02:05:41,311
And then you say,
well,

3042
02:05:41,311 --> 02:05:43,500
maybe I'll get some happiness if I get a
nice car.

3043
02:05:43,740 --> 02:05:47,820
And so you take out a lease on a nice
car and then now you have this debt they

3044
02:05:47,850 --> 02:05:49,960
have to pay.
So now you have to keep working and you

3045
02:05:49,961 --> 02:05:51,450
keep working.
So you can keep this car.

3046
02:05:51,451 --> 02:05:52,800
Well,
I'm going to get a condo and then you

3047
02:05:52,801 --> 02:05:54,000
get a Condo,
you got more dead.

3048
02:05:54,150 --> 02:05:55,800
Then while I'm getting married,
we're getting married.

3049
02:05:55,801 --> 02:05:57,030
Well,
we've got to take out a loan for the

3050
02:05:57,031 --> 02:05:59,540
marriage because it's really expensive
to get married and all.

3051
02:05:59,570 --> 02:06:02,010
She wants a big wedding.
And then you get a big wedding and a big

3052
02:06:02,011 --> 02:06:04,290
ring and all this,
and now you're fucking deep deep in the

3053
02:06:04,291 --> 02:06:06,570
hall and now you have children.
Oh Shit.

3054
02:06:06,900 --> 02:06:08,070
And then you know,
you're like,

3055
02:06:08,100 --> 02:06:09,390
wow,
I really don't want to be selling

3056
02:06:09,391 --> 02:06:10,870
insurance anymore.
I wish I coulda,

3057
02:06:10,880 --> 02:06:13,530
I wish I could have been an artist.
I wish I could have done this.

3058
02:06:13,531 --> 02:06:14,850
I wish I could have pursued my
interests.

3059
02:06:14,851 --> 02:06:16,590
Well,
it's kind of too late.

3060
02:06:16,740 --> 02:06:19,710
You're 150 miles away from the neutral
point,

3061
02:06:19,890 --> 02:06:23,370
so you've got to go 150 miles back
before you could start at zero.

3062
02:06:24,570 --> 02:06:26,660
I think he put us so well,
and I'm just thinking about that the,

3063
02:06:26,670 --> 02:06:30,210
this is the heart of my bit.
Lots of connections is saying we don't

3064
02:06:30,270 --> 02:06:33,090
have to have a human culture that
deadens people,

3065
02:06:33,091 --> 02:06:33,660
right?
Yeah.

3066
02:06:33,660 --> 02:06:36,120
We don't have to have a culture where
people are controlled,

3067
02:06:36,290 --> 02:06:39,480
dead end and isolated.
That's not how most humans have ever

3068
02:06:39,481 --> 02:06:40,830
lived.
The Amish live much,

3069
02:06:41,610 --> 02:06:44,580
far more human beings have lived in the
way the amish live that have ever lived

3070
02:06:44,581 --> 02:06:45,510
in the way we live.
Now.

3071
02:06:45,511 --> 02:06:47,340
I don't want to go fully back to the
amish obviously,

3072
02:06:47,640 --> 02:06:49,560
but,
but there are lessons we can learn from

3073
02:06:49,620 --> 02:06:50,940
all these things that we're talking
about,

3074
02:06:50,941 --> 02:06:52,680
about,
about reconnection to meaning and

3075
02:06:52,681 --> 02:06:54,240
purpose.
And part of what you're saying is we,

3076
02:06:54,370 --> 02:06:57,390
we live in a landscape that has been
constructed not to serve people,

3077
02:06:57,391 --> 02:06:59,010
but to serve corporations,
right?

3078
02:06:59,190 --> 02:07:03,330
This very unusual recent human
innovation actually is.

3079
02:07:03,330 --> 02:07:03,750
I said,
you know,

3080
02:07:03,750 --> 02:07:06,810
imagine if every corporation was
converted into democratic cooperatives.

3081
02:07:06,811 --> 02:07:09,990
Imagine everyone listening to this
tomorrow knew they were going into work

3082
02:07:09,991 --> 02:07:12,930
in a place where if there is a boss,
he's elected by them,

3083
02:07:13,170 --> 02:07:16,500
he's accountable to them.
Where you decide the priorities for your

3084
02:07:16,501 --> 02:07:17,760
workplace,
with your colleagues,

3085
02:07:17,761 --> 02:07:19,920
by voting maybe once every three months,
once a year,

3086
02:07:19,921 --> 02:07:22,980
whatever.
But the boss is accountable to you.

3087
02:07:23,130 --> 02:07:26,670
That's a very different way of living
and thinking about the things we do most

3088
02:07:26,671 --> 02:07:29,250
of the time.
And that would again require a vote for

3089
02:07:29,251 --> 02:07:33,650
a school system that prepares people to
be citizens taking part in a workplace,

3090
02:07:33,660 --> 02:07:36,670
not are you put brilliantly like robot
workers,

3091
02:07:36,850 --> 02:07:39,460
you know,
just passively receiving orders that

3092
02:07:39,461 --> 02:07:42,940
requires a big systemic change.
Now lots of people are making that

3093
02:07:42,941 --> 02:07:43,720
transition.
You know,

3094
02:07:43,720 --> 02:07:46,180
like the people I talked about in a
Baltimore bicycle works.

3095
02:07:46,180 --> 02:07:47,560
You've made that transition on their
own.

3096
02:07:47,920 --> 02:07:50,800
But these are,
these are big social changes.

3097
02:07:50,801 --> 02:07:53,080
We can make that the,
and again,

3098
02:07:53,140 --> 02:07:55,180
one of these that's so important is
about saying to people like,

3099
02:07:55,990 --> 02:07:58,960
it sounds to me like no one said to you,
Joe,

3100
02:07:59,170 --> 02:08:02,230
the fact that he fucking hate this
school is a sign that you are more

3101
02:08:02,231 --> 02:08:03,970
likely to be successful,
not less,

3102
02:08:03,971 --> 02:08:06,310
right.
The things that will make you a success

3103
02:08:06,311 --> 02:08:10,510
in your life are the things that this
school is trying to be out of you right

3104
02:08:10,511 --> 02:08:11,171
now.
I'm just presuming,

3105
02:08:11,171 --> 02:08:13,490
not literally be out of you,
but mentally be you.

3106
02:08:13,780 --> 02:08:16,450
Right.
And in a sense that that's what we need

3107
02:08:16,451 --> 02:08:19,300
to say to a lot of people about a lot of
these forms of discomfort.

3108
02:08:19,660 --> 02:08:22,840
It's not a sign of craziness.
It makes perfect sense.

3109
02:08:22,841 --> 02:08:25,480
You feel this way and you're right to
feel this way.

3110
02:08:25,610 --> 02:08:29,800
I wonder if that's what's causing all
these children to be on adderall and on,

3111
02:08:30,190 --> 02:08:31,100
you know,
all that.

3112
02:08:31,101 --> 02:08:33,680
The various stimulants they put kids on,
you know,

3113
02:08:33,681 --> 02:08:35,950
uh,
Prozac and all the different things that

3114
02:08:35,951 --> 02:08:36,750
they do.
A,

3115
02:08:36,750 --> 02:08:39,690
it's literally because they're trapped
in this thing and they can't do it and

3116
02:08:39,710 --> 02:08:40,990
they can't do it.
They can't do it.

3117
02:08:40,991 --> 02:08:43,570
And it's just they can't concentrate.
And so they give them something.

3118
02:08:43,820 --> 02:08:45,130
Yeah.
And they give them this pill and that

3119
02:08:45,131 --> 02:08:48,610
pill turns him into a worker robot.
And it's related to a lot of the things

3120
02:08:48,611 --> 02:08:50,890
we've talked about as well.
Increasing competition,

3121
02:08:50,891 --> 02:08:53,500
for example.
So parents are in such an unequal

3122
02:08:53,501 --> 02:08:54,500
society.
If you,

3123
02:08:54,510 --> 02:08:57,880
if you have a society like Norway,
where if a kid doesn't do well,

3124
02:08:57,900 --> 02:08:59,170
they're going to have a good life.
And if you could,

3125
02:08:59,171 --> 02:09:01,270
does really well,
they're going to have a good life.

3126
02:09:01,440 --> 02:09:01,930
Right.
You know,

3127
02:09:01,930 --> 02:09:04,300
there's less anxiety about,
oh my kids falling behind.

3128
02:09:04,500 --> 02:09:06,010
Yeah.
If your kid falls behind,

3129
02:09:06,160 --> 02:09:08,020
they can have a really fucking terrible
like,

3130
02:09:08,050 --> 02:09:08,740
yeah,
right here too.

3131
02:09:08,740 --> 02:09:11,500
But the counter that is rich kids don't
do well at all.

3132
02:09:11,920 --> 02:09:12,910
Miserable as hell.
Yeah.

3133
02:09:12,940 --> 02:09:16,150
I mean that's a real problem.
A real problem with kids that don't have

3134
02:09:16,151 --> 02:09:17,620
to do well.
But I think this,

3135
02:09:17,680 --> 02:09:19,120
this,
you've got society that drugs,

3136
02:09:19,121 --> 02:09:22,210
kids at the bottom to shut up these kids
in foster care who are traumatized,

3137
02:09:22,211 --> 02:09:25,780
not being looked after there being drug
to just basically make them dose aisle.

3138
02:09:26,140 --> 02:09:29,080
You've got kids at the top who are drug
to make them compete.

3139
02:09:29,081 --> 02:09:30,760
You know,
I mean I've got a friend who's a Wall

3140
02:09:30,761 --> 02:09:32,930
Street banker who,
um,

3141
02:09:33,270 --> 02:09:34,440
per his kid on,
on,

3142
02:09:34,480 --> 02:09:35,313
uh,
uh,

3143
02:09:35,320 --> 02:09:38,320
corrupt adderall originally one of the
stimulant drugs when he was a young

3144
02:09:38,321 --> 02:09:40,990
teenager cause he said,
but every other fucking kid in the class

3145
02:09:40,991 --> 02:09:41,570
is on it.

3146
02:09:41,570 --> 02:09:45,160
So if he doesn't go on it,
he's falling behind.

3147
02:09:45,720 --> 02:09:47,290
Um,
so you have the,

3148
02:09:47,291 --> 02:09:47,920
I mean,
what a,

3149
02:09:47,920 --> 02:09:51,130
what a sick culture is giving the
children a cocaine like drug.

3150
02:09:51,410 --> 02:09:53,720
Yeah.
To make them compete in,

3151
02:09:53,910 --> 02:09:57,130
in an unnatural way.
And the fucked up part is it works.

3152
02:09:57,670 --> 02:09:58,870
Yeah.
Well essentially,

3153
02:09:58,930 --> 02:09:59,890
so the research,
and this is interesting,

3154
02:09:59,891 --> 02:10:00,940
I think since the things worth pointing
out,

3155
02:10:00,941 --> 02:10:02,570
I'm worried about this in my book,
but um,

3156
02:10:02,920 --> 02:10:07,920
the actually there's evidence that um,
kids develop tolerance to it over time,

3157
02:10:08,051 --> 02:10:10,420
right.
So actually initially it works really,

3158
02:10:10,421 --> 02:10:13,780
really well and then gradually have to
get higher and higher doses until

3159
02:10:13,781 --> 02:10:15,490
eventually they,
uh,

3160
02:10:15,910 --> 02:10:19,260
there's a maximum limit it all day.
And then,

3161
02:10:19,300 --> 02:10:21,700
but then you have this real problem
where actually if you then take the kid

3162
02:10:21,701 --> 02:10:24,430
off it,
they will experience really severe

3163
02:10:24,460 --> 02:10:25,420
withdrawal.
Right.

3164
02:10:25,750 --> 02:10:27,250
And we'll often,
what that's misinterpreted is,

3165
02:10:27,251 --> 02:10:28,930
oh my God,
look at what happens to my kid when I

3166
02:10:28,931 --> 02:10:29,380
take him off.

3167
02:10:29,380 --> 02:10:30,161
And he goes,
it's like,

3168
02:10:30,161 --> 02:10:32,050
no,
that's not the baseline of your kid.

3169
02:10:32,080 --> 02:10:36,170
That's your kid in withdrawal from pain.
Like remarkable.

3170
02:10:36,230 --> 02:10:37,970
I mean I had a,
I spoke about this before,

3171
02:10:37,971 --> 02:10:41,030
so I think I can say I had a very close
relative who had a cocaine addiction.

3172
02:10:41,450 --> 02:10:43,910
And I remember at the height of her
cocaine addiction,

3173
02:10:44,300 --> 02:10:45,133
she had,
uh,

3174
02:10:45,250 --> 02:10:46,570
my neck,
one of my,

3175
02:10:46,690 --> 02:10:49,820
a young relative of mine that's friend's
prices ambiguously.

3176
02:10:50,090 --> 02:10:51,170
Who,
um,

3177
02:10:51,470 --> 02:10:55,060
she was drugging with Ritalin.
The doctor given it cause he didn't want

3178
02:10:55,061 --> 02:10:57,890
to focus cause he was traumatized
because his mother was a cocaine addict.

3179
02:10:57,891 --> 02:11:00,990
Right.
And I remember she used to go drive into

3180
02:11:01,010 --> 02:11:03,710
school in the morning.
She would snort a line of coke before

3181
02:11:03,711 --> 02:11:05,930
she went.
And then in the car he'd have to swallow

3182
02:11:05,931 --> 02:11:07,160
his cocaine,
like pill.

3183
02:11:07,161 --> 02:11:12,161
And I thought what a crazy culture that
her cocaine use is illegal and would end

3184
02:11:13,461 --> 02:11:16,070
up with,
had been criminally punished and his

3185
02:11:16,071 --> 02:11:19,070
cocaine lights substances required by
the police.

3186
02:11:19,400 --> 02:11:20,690
You know,
we required not required by the police

3187
02:11:20,700 --> 02:11:23,300
are required by the school and mandated
by the doctor.

3188
02:11:23,450 --> 02:11:26,540
What a crazy,
see what a culture that is fucked up

3189
02:11:26,570 --> 02:11:30,500
about how it thinks about altering
itself chemically about children,

3190
02:11:30,501 --> 02:11:34,300
about connection and that and the,
that my relative was very deprived.

3191
02:11:34,320 --> 02:11:37,970
The capacity to understand what was
happening to this is the coolest thing

3192
02:11:37,971 --> 02:11:39,680
we've done.
If you just give people these,

3193
02:11:39,830 --> 02:11:42,380
these ridiculously simplistic stories
about addiction,

3194
02:11:42,381 --> 02:11:45,350
it's just the chemical hook or this
ridiculously simplistic story about

3195
02:11:45,351 --> 02:11:47,180
depression.
It's just a chemical imbalance.

3196
02:11:47,570 --> 02:11:50,360
It's like we say,
you cut them off from understanding the

3197
02:11:50,361 --> 02:11:52,280
thing that's right in front of them.
And sometimes I think with,

3198
02:11:52,520 --> 02:11:55,310
with both my books were chasing the
scream and lost connections at times I

3199
02:11:55,311 --> 02:11:57,500
thought,
do I even need to say this?

3200
02:11:57,501 --> 02:11:58,970
It's so fucking Banal,
right?

3201
02:11:59,390 --> 02:12:01,820
If you're lonely,
if you're insecure,

3202
02:12:01,821 --> 02:12:03,900
you're going to be,
but actually he does need to be.

3203
02:12:03,900 --> 02:12:05,810
So when you say,
when you say it's people,

3204
02:12:06,380 --> 02:12:09,560
it's a very unusual position to be in a
position where you were saying something

3205
02:12:09,561 --> 02:12:13,670
that is both unbelievably obvious and
really quite radical.

3206
02:12:13,730 --> 02:12:14,660
Right.
That's a weird,

3207
02:12:14,900 --> 02:12:17,990
I can't think of managing it's common
sense but it's not common.

3208
02:12:18,650 --> 02:12:20,840
That's what got hungry by the time
they're really is what it is.

3209
02:12:20,841 --> 02:12:22,610
It's,
it's not a common understanding.

3210
02:12:22,850 --> 02:12:25,800
Now I want to get in to this,
um,

3211
02:12:26,120 --> 02:12:29,390
with you.
What about the criticisms of your work

3212
02:12:29,630 --> 02:12:31,650
and how have you,
have you taken that in?

3213
02:12:31,660 --> 02:12:36,110
If you debated anyone about your work?
Cause I read quite a few things online,

3214
02:12:36,620 --> 02:12:38,630
uh,
that were very critical and I didn't

3215
02:12:38,631 --> 02:12:40,160
agree with them.
I didn't agree with what they were

3216
02:12:40,161 --> 02:12:42,380
saying but I wanted to get your take on
it.

3217
02:12:42,530 --> 02:12:43,890
Sure.
So there were a few things,

3218
02:12:43,940 --> 02:12:45,260
few points that have been made.

3219
02:12:45,560 --> 02:12:47,030
Um,
there were a few pieces that were

3220
02:12:47,031 --> 02:12:50,240
written as soon as the book came out by
psychiatrist who admitted that to be

3221
02:12:50,241 --> 02:12:52,400
fair to the,
hadn't read the book and they were

3222
02:12:52,401 --> 02:12:55,550
responding to an extract from the book.
And obviously in the next structure you

3223
02:12:55,551 --> 02:12:57,350
can't make every point you want to make.
Right?

3224
02:12:57,351 --> 02:12:59,960
So is 100,000 what was the extract?
What was the,

3225
02:13:00,170 --> 02:13:04,430
so what I thought I was saying is even
though the piece I think break clearly

3226
02:13:04,431 --> 02:13:07,490
didn't say this is what they thought I
was saying is chemical anti depressants

3227
02:13:07,491 --> 02:13:09,740
are bad for everyone and people should
stop taking them.

3228
02:13:10,040 --> 02:13:12,590
If I had said that,
it would be totally right to criticize

3229
02:13:12,591 --> 02:13:13,850
me.
That's not my position.

3230
02:13:14,180 --> 02:13:17,380
My position.
Easy way to criticize you just cherry

3231
02:13:17,390 --> 02:13:20,180
pick and my position is,
you know what we said before,

3232
02:13:20,390 --> 02:13:23,150
chemical anti depressants give you a 1.8
points on the Hamilton scale,

3233
02:13:23,151 --> 02:13:23,450
right?

3234
02:13:23,450 --> 02:13:26,330
That's not nothing.
It's not much on average,

3235
02:13:26,331 --> 02:13:28,400
but it's not nothing.
Some people,

3236
02:13:28,401 --> 02:13:30,110
like for example,
one of my relatives,

3237
02:13:30,111 --> 02:13:31,560
the one that we talked about who is
trapped,

3238
02:13:32,400 --> 02:13:35,040
she takes chemical antidepressants.
I think she's right to take them right?

3239
02:13:35,041 --> 02:13:37,890
She's got very limited margin change.
She's not experiencing extreme side

3240
02:13:37,891 --> 02:13:41,750
effects as lots of people do.
I think she's right to caring for her at

3241
02:13:41,751 --> 02:13:44,670
1.8 points in a Hamilton scale is worth
having.

3242
02:13:45,210 --> 02:13:47,010
But it's not solving a problem,
right?

3243
02:13:47,220 --> 02:13:49,530
It's not solving the problem for the
vast majority of people.

3244
02:13:49,980 --> 02:13:52,380
And so I think there's been some
criticisms that are,

3245
02:13:54,090 --> 02:13:57,720
he's telling people to stop.
That's a dangerous and terrible thing to

3246
02:13:57,721 --> 02:13:59,080
do.
Uh,

3247
02:13:59,250 --> 02:14:01,800
so that's the most response to that is
read the book.

3248
02:14:01,830 --> 02:14:03,780
Cause I don't say that.
If I to say explicitly,

3249
02:14:03,781 --> 02:14:05,090
you should carry on taking them.
If for you,

3250
02:14:05,200 --> 02:14:07,170
the benefits outweigh the side effects.

3251
02:14:07,590 --> 02:14:10,040
Another criticism which I have more
sympathy for in,

3252
02:14:10,070 --> 02:14:11,550
I understand where it's coming from.
It's not,

3253
02:14:12,210 --> 02:14:15,300
is it's more like an ideological
misunderstanding.

3254
02:14:16,070 --> 02:14:18,750
Like we were saying,
we live in such an individualistic

3255
02:14:18,751 --> 02:14:19,441
culture.
The,

3256
02:14:19,441 --> 02:14:22,530
if someone comes along and it's,
we basically think there's two ways of

3257
02:14:22,531 --> 02:14:23,520
thinking about this,
right?

3258
02:14:24,480 --> 02:14:28,060
Either you,
your depression and your anxiety,

3259
02:14:28,061 --> 02:14:30,150
your addiction to due to a biological
problem,

3260
02:14:30,450 --> 02:14:32,280
in which case you deserve love and
support.

3261
02:14:32,850 --> 02:14:36,060
Or if you dismantle the biological
story,

3262
02:14:36,061 --> 02:14:37,770
what a lot of people hear is,
Oh my God,

3263
02:14:37,771 --> 02:14:39,870
you're saying it's my fault that I'm a
fuck up,

3264
02:14:39,920 --> 02:14:42,960
that I've got to solve this on my own.
And lots of people turning around and

3265
02:14:42,961 --> 02:14:43,471
going,
well,

3266
02:14:43,471 --> 02:14:45,660
I can't fucking go and democratize my
workplace.

3267
02:14:45,661 --> 02:14:49,810
I can't fucking go and you know,
take a load of Iowaska and learn what

3268
02:14:50,420 --> 02:14:52,410
they're just saying.
What are you talking about?

3269
02:14:52,770 --> 02:14:54,350
And I think because I'm talking in this,
this,

3270
02:14:54,360 --> 02:14:58,270
this third category,
which is biology is real,

3271
02:14:58,820 --> 02:15:01,170
is real,
but most of the drivers of this,

3272
02:15:01,171 --> 02:15:02,970
our social,
that in the way we live,

3273
02:15:03,420 --> 02:15:06,960
because for so long we've been trained
to not think in social terms.

3274
02:15:07,260 --> 02:15:09,780
I think a lot of people just literally
don't get what I'm saying,

3275
02:15:09,840 --> 02:15:11,250
right?
But when I was a kid,

3276
02:15:11,251 --> 02:15:13,950
Margaret Thatcher said the premise at
the time said,

3277
02:15:14,460 --> 02:15:17,280
there's no such thing as society.
There's only individuals and their

3278
02:15:17,281 --> 02:15:18,420
families.
Now,

3279
02:15:18,421 --> 02:15:23,100
I never liked Margaret Thatcher,
but this debate has made me realize how

3280
02:15:23,101 --> 02:15:24,540
much I internalize that.
Right?

3281
02:15:24,570 --> 02:15:27,960
I was depressed that 13 years I'd
fucking studied social sciences.

3282
02:15:27,961 --> 02:15:29,940
Right?
It never even occurred to me.

3283
02:15:29,941 --> 02:15:32,160
There was a societal component to how
bad I felt.

3284
02:15:32,220 --> 02:15:34,860
Right?
So I was kind of like a thatcherite to

3285
02:15:34,861 --> 02:15:37,380
my own pain and distress.
Do you see what I mean?

3286
02:15:37,650 --> 02:15:40,200
And I think we've,
so we've so individualized and

3287
02:15:40,201 --> 02:15:42,990
internally we start internalize this
individualism.

3288
02:15:43,440 --> 02:15:45,070
The,
I think people are understanding.

3289
02:15:45,080 --> 02:15:46,390
Again,
they were riffing on the extracts.

3290
02:15:46,410 --> 02:15:48,660
These are not people who've read the
book in the main,

3291
02:15:49,200 --> 02:15:52,230
but I think it was kind of
understandable for them to be like,

3292
02:15:52,710 --> 02:15:53,910
fuck you,
I can't do that.

3293
02:15:54,260 --> 02:15:56,070
You know,
I can see why they're saying that I'm

3294
02:15:56,071 --> 02:15:58,260
not.
So I wouldn't push back on them so hard

3295
02:15:58,261 --> 02:15:59,094
because think,
well,

3296
02:15:59,310 --> 02:16:01,700
there are narrow margins and this is why
we need to check.

3297
02:16:01,890 --> 02:16:03,960
And people get that.
If you talk about car accidents,

3298
02:16:03,961 --> 02:16:07,770
right?
We individual drivers should drive

3299
02:16:07,771 --> 02:16:09,320
safely.
Um,

3300
02:16:09,720 --> 02:16:12,390
but we don't just leave car safety up to
that.

3301
02:16:12,391 --> 02:16:15,840
We have airbags and seat belts and speed
limits.

3302
02:16:16,020 --> 02:16:18,860
Driving tests were dry arrest people
under Duis,

3303
02:16:18,900 --> 02:16:20,550
right?
If we just took away all those things

3304
02:16:20,551 --> 02:16:22,080
and just said to individual drivers,
hey,

3305
02:16:22,090 --> 02:16:25,350
drivers and pedestrians,
pedestrians take care of drivers,

3306
02:16:25,351 --> 02:16:27,750
take care,
we would have far more people dying in

3307
02:16:27,751 --> 02:16:29,040
car accidents than we do now.

3308
02:16:29,050 --> 02:16:31,570
Right?
So we accept that there's individual,

3309
02:16:31,630 --> 02:16:33,220
an individual role,
but there's a social role,

3310
02:16:33,221 --> 02:16:34,840
right?
The whole society deals with the problem

3311
02:16:34,841 --> 02:16:38,400
of car accidents and what I'm saying is
the whole society should deal with the

3312
02:16:38,401 --> 02:16:41,290
problem with depression and anxiety.
We need social changes like

3313
02:16:41,291 --> 02:16:44,470
democratizing workplaces is one we've
talked about a lot that reduced the

3314
02:16:44,471 --> 02:16:46,900
reasons why people are so depressed and
anxious in the first place,

3315
02:16:47,170 --> 02:16:49,420
but I think in a society that is so
devalued,

3316
02:16:49,421 --> 02:16:52,870
the idea of the social,
it's just I may as well be speaking

3317
02:16:52,871 --> 02:16:54,460
fucking Swedish where they could
understand it.

3318
02:16:54,461 --> 02:16:55,300
What is it?
You see what I mean?

3319
02:16:55,640 --> 02:16:59,420
I think they're just neglecting to
consider the possibility that some of

3320
02:16:59,421 --> 02:17:04,421
the factors are because of your life and
and the the social aspects,

3321
02:17:04,431 --> 02:17:06,320
the physical aspects,
the exercise,

3322
02:17:06,321 --> 02:17:07,910
the Diet,
all those various things.

3323
02:17:08,210 --> 02:17:10,730
There's many,
many people that do certain neglecting

3324
02:17:10,731 --> 02:17:15,731
to take those even into consideration.
I also think people work way too much.

3325
02:17:16,190 --> 02:17:18,170
I don't think that's the way to live
your life.

3326
02:17:18,440 --> 02:17:21,650
I think we've got a really bad system
and I think the system has existed for

3327
02:17:21,651 --> 02:17:24,200
so long that we assume that this is the
only way to live,

3328
02:17:24,290 --> 02:17:27,440
that you have to do a 40 hour work week.
I think it's ridiculous.

3329
02:17:27,710 --> 02:17:31,340
I think we should work maybe four days a
week and it might be three.

3330
02:17:31,760 --> 02:17:32,960
We might,
we may be,

3331
02:17:32,961 --> 02:17:36,080
people would be more productive.
They kicked ass for three days a week

3332
02:17:36,081 --> 02:17:37,640
and then had a fun time for,
for,

3333
02:17:37,910 --> 02:17:38,930
you know,
maybe,

3334
02:17:39,140 --> 02:17:42,710
maybe it's like one on one off,
one on one off,

3335
02:17:42,711 --> 02:17:43,580
one on one off.

3336
02:17:43,610 --> 02:17:45,800
Maybe it's like that.
And just that's the way we live life.

3337
02:17:45,950 --> 02:17:48,560
Like have a fucking work day and have a
day where you don't work.

3338
02:17:48,800 --> 02:17:52,730
Have you choose to live to work more
because you know you're trying to pursue

3339
02:17:52,731 --> 02:17:55,310
something and you're a dedicated person.
You have a job.

3340
02:17:55,311 --> 02:17:58,910
That's one thing.
But I just think this soul sucking grind

3341
02:17:58,940 --> 02:17:59,630
of,
you know,

3342
02:17:59,630 --> 02:18:04,630
getting out of college 21 and grinding
until you're 65 and the new look forward

3343
02:18:04,881 --> 02:18:07,550
to your golden years.
You're dying motherfucker.

3344
02:18:07,640 --> 02:18:10,240
There's no golden years.
That's all horse shit you,

3345
02:18:10,241 --> 02:18:11,960
you know,
you watch it on golden pond too many

3346
02:18:11,961 --> 02:18:13,700
times,
you're not going to make it.

3347
02:18:13,820 --> 02:18:17,350
The only
bad example,

3348
02:18:17,360 --> 02:18:18,193
he hit his daughter,

3349
02:18:18,500 --> 02:18:21,850
maybe the golden girls movie is a really
shit feel much epilepsy please.

3350
02:18:21,851 --> 02:18:22,810
She's like,
I'll wash it for the first time.

3351
02:18:22,840 --> 02:18:24,980
I played recently by,
there was another thing going on.

3352
02:18:25,130 --> 02:18:27,320
There's another thing going on.
I had to make sure I that miss my

3353
02:18:27,321 --> 02:18:28,490
flight,
but there's nothing going on,

3354
02:18:28,491 --> 02:18:33,410
which is
what we've done is we've told people the

3355
02:18:33,411 --> 02:18:37,850
path out of stigma is to say that the
problem is just biological.

3356
02:18:37,870 --> 02:18:38,480
Right?
Right.

3357
02:18:38,480 --> 02:18:41,330
So we said people,
you should not be criticized for having

3358
02:18:41,331 --> 02:18:43,490
an imbalance.
We even more than that,

3359
02:18:43,520 --> 02:18:46,880
it's like having a pancreas disease.
We just need to give you a medication.

3360
02:18:47,030 --> 02:18:50,030
Exactly.
We've told people you should not be

3361
02:18:50,031 --> 02:18:52,010
judged for your depression,
anxiety,

3362
02:18:52,011 --> 02:18:53,630
addiction because it's a biological
problem.

3363
02:18:54,410 --> 02:18:56,900
I entirely agree.
Obviously people should not be judged

3364
02:18:56,960 --> 02:18:58,550
for their anxiety,
depression or addiction,

3365
02:18:58,880 --> 02:19:00,200
but actually it's a really interesting
experiment.

3366
02:19:00,200 --> 02:19:02,710
They show you that this is just a
complete Monday's first trigger me and

3367
02:19:02,711 --> 02:19:05,690
this is I to be an amazing
neuroscientists call Mark Lewis,

3368
02:19:05,720 --> 02:19:07,340
who I was talking about this and I said,
you know,

3369
02:19:07,341 --> 02:19:09,620
I'm worried cause you explaining a lot
of the things we've talked about to me

3370
02:19:09,770 --> 02:19:11,810
early in my research.
And I said,

3371
02:19:11,811 --> 02:19:13,130
you know,
I'm worried about this mark,

3372
02:19:13,200 --> 02:19:15,290
because won't this just reintroduced
stigma,

3373
02:19:15,291 --> 02:19:16,370
right?
If we're saying it's not just

3374
02:19:16,371 --> 02:19:17,270
biological.
And he said,

3375
02:19:17,720 --> 02:19:20,990
yeah.
Did anyone ever doubt but leprosy or

3376
02:19:20,991 --> 02:19:23,310
AIDS were biological problems?
Right?

3377
02:19:23,380 --> 02:19:25,160
Right.
Literally nobody ever doubted that.

3378
02:19:25,161 --> 02:19:27,890
Zero.
You might have noticed there was some

3379
02:19:27,891 --> 02:19:30,710
stigma against leprosy and aids.
Why do you think saying something is

3380
02:19:30,711 --> 02:19:33,980
biological removes the stigma around it?
I thought I say it again.

3381
02:19:33,981 --> 02:19:35,090
It's a simple point.
The wow,

3382
02:19:35,091 --> 02:19:37,490
I'd never thought of that.
But there's actually an experiment by

3383
02:19:37,491 --> 02:19:39,770
women I interviewed called a Professor
Sheila matter,

3384
02:19:40,340 --> 02:19:42,050
which looked at this question of stigma.

3385
02:19:42,050 --> 02:19:43,310
She,
so she wanted to pick her out,

3386
02:19:44,240 --> 02:19:47,180
which is more de stigmatizing,
telling people,

3387
02:19:47,570 --> 02:19:48,380
uh,
that,

3388
02:19:48,380 --> 02:19:53,240
that mental health problems are caused
by your biology or saying that caused by

3389
02:19:53,241 --> 02:19:55,880
your life.
It's what they do is it's a little bit

3390
02:19:55,881 --> 02:19:57,680
of a complex experiment.
I think it's worth explaining.

3391
02:19:58,340 --> 02:20:00,080
Say you're the guy who's taking part in
the experiment.

3392
02:20:00,110 --> 02:20:03,140
They bring you in and they say,
before the experiment begins,

3393
02:20:03,290 --> 02:20:05,240
we just want you to sit here and fill in
a questionnaire,

3394
02:20:05,420 --> 02:20:07,130
right?
This is you don't realize,

3395
02:20:07,131 --> 02:20:10,160
but this is actually the experiment.
It's you're sitting next to someone else

3396
02:20:10,161 --> 02:20:13,760
who you don't realize as an actor and
you get chatting and the actable sup.

3397
02:20:14,120 --> 02:20:16,910
They'll run it two ways.
Sometimes the actor will say,

3398
02:20:16,911 --> 02:20:20,420
I've got a mental health problem because
of my biology,

3399
02:20:20,900 --> 02:20:23,930
and sometimes he'll say,
I've got a mental health problem because

3400
02:20:23,931 --> 02:20:25,460
of bad things that have happened to me.

3401
02:20:25,610 --> 02:20:27,710
Right?
Then you told the experiments beginning

3402
02:20:27,711 --> 02:20:30,770
come through to this room and you're
told you joe have got to teach this

3403
02:20:30,771 --> 02:20:32,620
other person.
The person you don't realize as an actor

3404
02:20:32,990 --> 02:20:35,630
a pattern.
It's like a patent on a computer is

3405
02:20:35,631 --> 02:20:39,380
we're testing how well people learn
patterns and every once you've taught it

3406
02:20:39,381 --> 02:20:41,120
to him,
every time he gets it wrong,

3407
02:20:41,121 --> 02:20:43,160
I want you to push this button and this
button,

3408
02:20:43,161 --> 02:20:45,800
we'll give him a short sharp electric
shock,

3409
02:20:46,040 --> 02:20:47,360
right?
Won't kill him or anything.

3410
02:20:47,361 --> 02:20:49,030
It's not going to fuck him up,
but it,

3411
02:20:49,031 --> 02:20:50,480
it's uncomfortable.
Right?

3412
02:20:51,260 --> 02:20:54,560
And they wanted to see would there be a
difference in how many electric shocks

3413
02:20:54,561 --> 02:20:58,130
and how hard you hit hit the button,
depending on what you were told,

3414
02:20:58,131 --> 02:21:01,760
what they found was you were
significantly more like you zapped the

3415
02:21:01,761 --> 02:21:05,090
person more and harder if you thought
that the problem is just due to their

3416
02:21:05,091 --> 02:21:08,210
biology than if it was due to things
that happened to them in their lives.

3417
02:21:08,480 --> 02:21:13,190
And I think that's because I think this
is the stuff we're talking about is the

3418
02:21:13,191 --> 02:21:15,500
part that stigma because what it says,
if what we're saying is this just this

3419
02:21:15,501 --> 02:21:19,220
class of people who are biologically
different to us and they have this floor

3420
02:21:19,221 --> 02:21:21,370
that you and I don't have,
um,

3421
02:21:21,440 --> 02:21:23,060
you can see why that leads to stigma,
right?

3422
02:21:23,061 --> 02:21:26,000
But if what you're saying is actually
we're all uniquely,

3423
02:21:26,030 --> 02:21:29,960
we're all vulnerable to this stuff.
I'm actually the things that are making

3424
02:21:29,961 --> 02:21:31,520
some people depressed,
anxious,

3425
02:21:31,521 --> 02:21:35,300
and addicted and making loads of us just
less happy than we could be less

3426
02:21:35,301 --> 02:21:37,280
fulfilled than we could be.
What that does,

3427
02:21:37,281 --> 02:21:39,470
instead of making dividing us into two
tribes,

3428
02:21:39,471 --> 02:21:42,950
it says we're all on a continuum,
and actually the fight that will help

3429
02:21:42,951 --> 02:21:47,270
these people who are depressed and
anxious will also improve your life.

3430
02:21:47,300 --> 02:21:49,370
Right.
That's to me a much more powerful

3431
02:21:49,371 --> 02:21:49,680
message.

3432
02:21:49,680 --> 02:21:53,660
It's solving a problem,
being an inexplicably biological

3433
02:21:53,661 --> 02:21:58,220
malfunction.
It's a response to things that you can

3434
02:21:58,221 --> 02:21:59,120
see in your life.
Right.

3435
02:21:59,150 --> 02:22:00,620
Well,
it's interesting that we've always had

3436
02:22:00,621 --> 02:22:02,450
the term sadness,
right?

3437
02:22:02,451 --> 02:22:06,110
People have always experienced sadness,
but if you go back and go through

3438
02:22:06,111 --> 02:22:08,240
ancient literature,
you don't see a lot of stories about

3439
02:22:08,241 --> 02:22:12,410
people suffering from depression.
That's a relatively new distinction.

3440
02:22:12,470 --> 02:22:15,440
You did get people who talk about melon
Melancholia.

3441
02:22:15,730 --> 02:22:16,440
Yeah,
sure.

3442
02:22:16,440 --> 02:22:21,110
Do you think depression has always the,
the state's been acute and extreme

3443
02:22:21,111 --> 02:22:23,630
unhappiness.
Always been people living on happy

3444
02:22:23,631 --> 02:22:26,400
lives,
but the state being depressed

3445
02:22:26,610 --> 02:22:31,610
as being a clinical,
psychological sort of a diagnosis that's

3446
02:22:31,771 --> 02:22:32,850
relatively recent.
Well,

3447
02:22:32,851 --> 02:22:36,420
the idea that it's a pathology and it's
probably coming up to,

3448
02:22:36,510 --> 02:22:37,860
I was thinking,
but this way you were speaking earlier.

3449
02:22:38,660 --> 02:22:39,990
Um,
we do,

3450
02:22:40,220 --> 02:22:42,750
when we talk about food,
that's the thing of it is you can tell

3451
02:22:42,751 --> 02:22:46,110
him what was that British when I first
came to the,

3452
02:22:46,740 --> 02:22:49,250
the u s I never remember,
I remember the first time someone ever

3453
02:22:49,260 --> 02:22:52,050
offered me an indigestion pill,
which they don't exist.

3454
02:22:52,051 --> 02:22:54,540
Ingestion pill that you can buy them in,
like,

3455
02:22:54,650 --> 02:22:56,360
like pepto Bismol or something like
that.

3456
02:22:56,361 --> 02:22:58,890
Right.
And I meant that just saying,

3457
02:22:58,891 --> 02:23:00,510
but,
but wait,

3458
02:23:01,110 --> 02:23:03,840
indigestion is a sign from your body.
You're eating too fast.

3459
02:23:03,841 --> 02:23:06,030
You don't want to,
you don't want to get rid of that

3460
02:23:06,120 --> 02:23:06,953
signal.
You'll,

3461
02:23:07,300 --> 02:23:09,960
you'll,
you'll eat too much or hurt yourself.

3462
02:23:09,961 --> 02:23:10,681
Right.
That,

3463
02:23:10,681 --> 02:23:11,880
that's,
that's not a malfunction.

3464
02:23:11,881 --> 02:23:12,840
That's,
that's a function.

3465
02:23:12,841 --> 02:23:13,674
Right?
Right.

3466
02:23:15,720 --> 02:23:16,411
What about that?
You know,

3467
02:23:16,411 --> 02:23:17,940
that the,
it comes back to so many things we're

3468
02:23:17,941 --> 02:23:21,540
saying,
the things,

3469
02:23:21,541 --> 02:23:25,020
the feelings that we have of distress
are not malfunctions.

3470
02:23:25,340 --> 02:23:27,570
That telling us something is missing in
the environment,

3471
02:23:27,630 --> 02:23:29,550
in the psychology,
in our lives.

3472
02:23:29,880 --> 02:23:33,900
They're not fuck ups with as a signal
industry that they,

3473
02:23:33,910 --> 02:23:37,170
they,
they benefit from feeling that void.

3474
02:23:37,171 --> 02:23:39,600
Like if you've got an issue,
they've got a pill for it and as soon as

3475
02:23:39,690 --> 02:23:41,790
you create that sort of an an
environment,

3476
02:23:41,970 --> 02:23:44,340
they're going to constantly be
innovating and trying to come up with

3477
02:23:44,341 --> 02:23:47,880
new pills for new issues and even create
ailments,

3478
02:23:48,160 --> 02:23:52,080
makeup ailments and come up with
solutions for those ailments.

3479
02:23:52,081 --> 02:23:53,490
And a lot of those are actually,
we've,

3480
02:23:53,580 --> 02:23:55,530
we've shown this on the podcast many
times.

3481
02:23:55,830 --> 02:24:00,630
Those were done by advertising agencies.
They've actually created names of

3482
02:24:00,631 --> 02:24:04,230
diseases and issues just so they can
come up with solutions.

3483
02:24:04,230 --> 02:24:06,540
One of the things that was most shocking
in the research,

3484
02:24:06,541 --> 02:24:11,541
but the loss connections was realizing
how much of what I had been told was

3485
02:24:12,120 --> 02:24:14,790
invented,
not by scientists but by drug company

3486
02:24:14,791 --> 02:24:16,560
PRS.
So it,

3487
02:24:16,620 --> 02:24:19,030
I'll give you an example,
two examples that print,

3488
02:24:19,070 --> 02:24:20,370
I'm going to have to go in and set.
No worries.

3489
02:24:21,650 --> 02:24:23,990
Um,
what got you one other interview before

3490
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:25,920
my flight.
So fuck that interview.

3491
02:24:26,620 --> 02:24:27,890
Sorry.
The uh,

3492
02:24:29,900 --> 02:24:32,940
the,
there's this so everyone knows,

3493
02:24:32,941 --> 02:24:35,370
if you think about taking selfies,
right?

3494
02:24:35,420 --> 02:24:37,290
You take 30,
30 selfies,

3495
02:24:37,291 --> 02:24:40,410
you throw away 29 and you only used the
one that can't do that.

3496
02:24:40,411 --> 02:24:42,690
Don't be a bitch.
Take a selfie and go with it.

3497
02:24:42,691 --> 02:24:45,150
It's like deniro in the deer hunter,
one bullet,

3498
02:24:46,930 --> 02:24:49,290
the three that you already have.
You know,

3499
02:24:49,300 --> 02:24:50,730
you use the one where you look good,
right?

3500
02:24:50,970 --> 02:24:53,770
Turns out in the whole process when,
um,

3501
02:24:54,870 --> 02:24:56,550
antidepressants were first being
marketed to us,

3502
02:24:56,551 --> 02:24:58,530
they basically did that with scientific
studies.

3503
02:24:58,740 --> 02:25:01,860
What they did is they,
they,

3504
02:25:02,070 --> 02:25:04,980
they would commission a hundred studies.
Uh,

3505
02:25:05,010 --> 02:25:08,640
90 of them would say mixed results or
poor results.

3506
02:25:08,880 --> 02:25:11,760
Those all got put in the trashcan.
And the only,

3507
02:25:11,761 --> 02:25:12,361
the ones where,
I mean,

3508
02:25:12,361 --> 02:25:14,250
there's one study I cite in the book,
I think it was,

3509
02:25:14,520 --> 02:25:19,520
they tested the drug on 247 people and
they only published the results for 27

3510
02:25:19,711 --> 02:25:21,930
of them,
who you will not find it hard to guess

3511
02:25:21,931 --> 02:25:23,520
where the 27 for whom it,
right.

3512
02:25:23,530 --> 02:25:24,220
So the early

3513
02:25:24,220 --> 02:25:27,540
results were hugely exaggerated.
You'll remember that when

3514
02:25:27,550 --> 02:25:29,470
antidepressants were first marketed,
people are told,

3515
02:25:29,471 --> 02:25:31,630
you know,
it'll make you better than well,

3516
02:25:31,690 --> 02:25:32,950
right?
No one says that.

3517
02:25:32,951 --> 02:25:34,210
Now you'll notice that stuff's all gone
away,

3518
02:25:34,211 --> 02:25:35,200
right?
It doesn't happen anymore.

3519
02:25:35,650 --> 02:25:36,820
Um,
so there's this huge,

3520
02:25:36,880 --> 02:25:39,760
actually Eliot Spitzer did an amazing
job when he was attorney general in New

3521
02:25:39,760 --> 02:25:41,950
York state.
I've taken the pharmaceutical companies

3522
02:25:41,951 --> 02:25:44,050
to,
to court because it's particularly

3523
02:25:44,051 --> 02:25:46,690
affected me when I read it because it
was the drug that I was given as a

3524
02:25:46,691 --> 02:25:47,830
teenager.
It's,

3525
02:25:47,831 --> 02:25:50,440
um,
called paroxetine or Paxil in the u s

3526
02:25:50,860 --> 02:25:52,510
um,
that the,

3527
02:25:52,511 --> 02:25:55,870
the company that manufacturers,
it literally had a leaked memo from them

3528
02:25:55,871 --> 02:25:58,510
in which they say this doesn't work for
teenagers,

3529
02:25:58,511 --> 02:26:01,360
but that I think the phrase they used
was this would be unacceptable for the

3530
02:26:01,361 --> 02:26:05,680
commercial profile of paroxetine.
So they just said that it did and that's

3531
02:26:05,681 --> 02:26:06,700
the fucking drug I was given.

3532
02:26:06,700 --> 02:26:08,500
Right.
It's shocking to see the drug that you

3533
02:26:08,501 --> 02:26:11,320
were given the,
this company involved.

3534
02:26:11,321 --> 02:26:13,350
So it didn't work for people like you.
Right,

3535
02:26:13,530 --> 02:26:14,363
right.
Um,

3536
02:26:14,550 --> 02:26:15,340
and,
and,

3537
02:26:15,340 --> 02:26:17,140
and you know,
when it had very powerful side effects

3538
02:26:17,141 --> 02:26:18,820
on me,
I gained a huge amount of way.

3539
02:26:18,821 --> 02:26:21,250
It has all sorts of side effects.
Um,

3540
02:26:21,520 --> 02:26:23,140
the,
did it help you at all?

3541
02:26:24,190 --> 02:26:28,270
I thought a strong initial boost and I
would say it probably did give me 1.8

3542
02:26:28,271 --> 02:26:31,000
points on the Hamilton scale.
Like what we're talking about probably

3543
02:26:31,001 --> 02:26:34,330
gave me a very mild boost,
but it didn't solve my problem.

3544
02:26:34,660 --> 02:26:37,120
And the problem is the story I was told
about it,

3545
02:26:37,440 --> 02:26:41,140
that this is the solution because the
problem is the chemical imbalance

3546
02:26:41,440 --> 02:26:45,220
disconnected me from a much wider
program of reconnection in my life that

3547
02:26:45,221 --> 02:26:47,320
did in fact solve my depression when I
embarked on it.

3548
02:26:47,321 --> 02:26:48,154
Right.
The,

3549
02:26:48,340 --> 02:26:51,180
the so,
so I think the,

3550
02:26:51,181 --> 02:26:55,630
the drug companies,
it's scandalous what they did.

3551
02:26:55,630 --> 02:26:57,280
It's not that the drugs have no value,
they do,

3552
02:26:57,580 --> 02:27:01,000
but when you read through what they
actually did and the way the stories

3553
02:27:01,001 --> 02:27:02,690
were constructed,
um,

3554
02:27:02,700 --> 02:27:03,550
and the,
the,

3555
02:27:03,551 --> 02:27:04,580
the,
the,

3556
02:27:04,620 --> 02:27:08,290
the
bullshit we were told,

3557
02:27:08,710 --> 02:27:10,150
you know,
I mean I remember it just being a

3558
02:27:10,151 --> 02:27:13,960
clinical psychologist talk to Lucy
Johnson and he's a brilliant person and

3559
02:27:13,961 --> 02:27:14,830
her just saying,
you know,

3560
02:27:15,550 --> 02:27:18,970
everything you were told is bullshit.
And me just sitting there and going

3561
02:27:18,971 --> 02:27:20,080
through this is what my daughter told
me.

3562
02:27:20,081 --> 02:27:21,260
This is what my doctor told me.
This isn't my daughter.

3563
02:27:21,500 --> 02:27:23,680
She's the fact that shit bullshit
cautions,

3564
02:27:23,681 --> 02:27:26,200
no legal repercussions against those
people for doing that.

3565
02:27:26,201 --> 02:27:28,070
It's just stunning.
I mean there was something about what

3566
02:27:28,300 --> 02:27:32,680
you think about like insider trading,
how devastating the penalties are for

3567
02:27:32,681 --> 02:27:34,930
that.
This is far worse.

3568
02:27:35,200 --> 02:27:38,260
One of the scandals is the um,
the FDA,

3569
02:27:38,261 --> 02:27:40,480
how much of it is funded by the drug
companies itself?

3570
02:27:40,570 --> 02:27:42,280
Right.
40% of the budget.

3571
02:27:42,460 --> 02:27:44,770
I mean,
imagine if you had a ballgame where one

3572
02:27:44,771 --> 02:27:48,820
side was fun,
where one of the teams paid the referees

3573
02:27:48,821 --> 02:27:49,451
wages.
Right?

3574
02:27:49,451 --> 02:27:51,490
Right.
I think you'd find that gate that,

3575
02:27:51,491 --> 02:27:53,380
that that team would win a lot more
often.

3576
02:27:53,400 --> 02:27:55,120
All right,
so what we think is,

3577
02:27:55,390 --> 02:27:57,010
oh,
there's this dispassionate judge,

3578
02:27:57,040 --> 02:27:57,873
the,
and one of those scans.

3579
02:27:57,880 --> 02:28:00,640
Even the way the rules are constructed.
So to get a drug,

3580
02:28:00,810 --> 02:28:02,650
and I think there would have been
slightly tightened recently,

3581
02:28:02,651 --> 02:28:06,940
but the t one entity presence were first
introduced to get a drug to market.

3582
02:28:07,300 --> 02:28:11,920
You only had to demonstrate to studies
anywhere that shows any efficacy.

3583
02:28:11,921 --> 02:28:15,160
Right?
So that means you could commission 3000

3584
02:28:15,161 --> 02:28:18,250
studies and if two of them,
it's not that the FDA would take the

3585
02:28:18,251 --> 02:28:21,730
balance of the research,
if you could show to that it works.

3586
02:28:21,790 --> 02:28:24,050
That's what they represent those studies
to the FDA.

3587
02:28:24,050 --> 02:28:26,000
They didn't have to show them everything
they've done.

3588
02:28:26,001 --> 02:28:27,260
Exactly.
It's gotten a bit better now.

3589
02:28:27,261 --> 02:28:30,170
There's now more publication required,
which is one of the reasons why so few

3590
02:28:30,980 --> 02:28:33,710
new chemical antidepressants are coming
onto the market because the rules have

3591
02:28:33,711 --> 02:28:36,560
been slightly tightened.
And as a result where all the new ones,

3592
02:28:36,561 --> 02:28:37,570
they're not coming on,
you know,

3593
02:28:37,580 --> 02:28:38,331
the,
I mean there are some,

3594
02:28:38,331 --> 02:28:41,630
but they're far more limited.
How has he shown also that rigorous

3595
02:28:41,631 --> 02:28:44,360
exercise is actually more effective in
treating depression than

3596
02:28:44,361 --> 02:28:47,090
antidepressants?
I think I was going a bit too far,

3597
02:28:47,091 --> 02:28:49,280
but there's evidence that while there's
very strong,

3598
02:28:49,281 --> 02:28:50,660
if it's taught to Isabelle banker who
you should,

3599
02:28:50,690 --> 02:28:52,820
you would love,
I should introduce you to her.

3600
02:28:53,120 --> 02:28:54,880
She's a primatologist Chilean
primatologist,

3601
02:28:54,920 --> 02:28:56,910
basically the best person in the world
as far as can said.

3602
02:28:57,240 --> 02:29:00,290
She's a hardcore chalea and she's
currently in some jungle somewhere

3603
02:29:00,291 --> 02:29:01,730
better than Mick Jagger's ex wife.

3604
02:29:01,810 --> 02:29:02,590
Uh,
yeah,

3605
02:29:02,590 --> 02:29:03,021
yeah.
I mean,

3606
02:29:03,021 --> 02:29:05,720
I like Marianne Faithfull,
but Isabel as something else.

3607
02:29:05,721 --> 02:29:07,490
Right.
So it's about ultimately is my last

3608
02:29:07,491 --> 02:29:08,330
point,
but Isabelle,

3609
02:29:08,540 --> 02:29:10,610
so she's demonstrated,
she showing loads of things.

3610
02:29:10,611 --> 02:29:12,630
One of the real interesting things is,
um,

3611
02:29:12,710 --> 02:29:15,950
nature,
so she's shown that exercise is a

3612
02:29:15,951 --> 02:29:18,170
massive,
really powerful anti depressant.

3613
02:29:18,171 --> 02:29:22,370
But interestingly,
exercise in nature is even more

3614
02:29:22,371 --> 02:29:24,780
effective.
And she's shown her theories.

3615
02:29:24,890 --> 02:29:26,580
And I really liked this.
She,

3616
02:29:26,810 --> 02:29:29,600
she did a lot of work with Bonobos,
both in zoos and in the wild.

3617
02:29:29,960 --> 02:29:33,980
And she's got really good stories about
how Benobos basically bond by lesbian

3618
02:29:33,981 --> 02:29:35,030
group sex.
And she,

3619
02:29:35,240 --> 02:29:35,790
she,
she,

3620
02:29:35,790 --> 02:29:38,780
she's had a pioneer how they managed to
create vibrators when they're in the

3621
02:29:38,781 --> 02:29:39,800
zoo.
It's an amazing story,

3622
02:29:39,801 --> 02:29:41,280
but the,
uh,

3623
02:29:41,950 --> 02:29:44,300
like literally she would like get the
buckets and they would find a way to

3624
02:29:44,301 --> 02:29:46,550
turn it into a vibrator.
She was more of them,

3625
02:29:46,710 --> 02:29:47,490
right?

3626
02:29:47,490 --> 02:29:49,820
And then have massive lesbian origins
with their vibrators,

3627
02:29:50,570 --> 02:29:52,760
British Zeus,
and he's like polite British parents

3628
02:29:52,761 --> 02:29:55,090
would be like,
what's happening?

3629
02:29:55,100 --> 02:29:56,990
And they'd be like,
come over here.

3630
02:29:57,200 --> 02:30:01,820
But the is the most theories.
So animals go crazy and zoos a lot of

3631
02:30:01,821 --> 02:30:02,371
the time,
right?

3632
02:30:02,371 --> 02:30:06,320
Carrots rip out their feathers,
horses start obsessively swaying.

3633
02:30:07,140 --> 02:30:09,770
Elephants will grind their tasks down to
nothing.

3634
02:30:10,190 --> 02:30:11,590
Um,
uh,

3635
02:30:12,110 --> 02:30:14,130
and,
and she basically argues is [inaudible]

3636
02:30:14,250 --> 02:30:15,440
Bob,
this is simplifying your argument.

3637
02:30:15,441 --> 02:30:18,620
She has as many things going on here.
But um,

3638
02:30:19,380 --> 02:30:20,110
the,
the,

3639
02:30:20,110 --> 02:30:24,260
the humans are being animals deprived of
their habitat feel like shit.

3640
02:30:24,620 --> 02:30:26,750
And we are increasingly deprived of our
habitat.

3641
02:30:26,751 --> 02:30:28,220
The habitat we evolved in,
right?

3642
02:30:28,520 --> 02:30:31,310
There's lots of evidence that people who
live in areas with no green space,

3643
02:30:31,311 --> 02:30:33,110
I'm much more likely to become depressed
than people who don't.

3644
02:30:33,290 --> 02:30:36,590
And people who move from one area
without greenspace torn area,

3645
02:30:36,600 --> 02:30:38,450
we greenspace become much less
depressed,

3646
02:30:38,451 --> 02:30:39,680
rise loads of research on this.

3647
02:30:39,880 --> 02:30:44,880
There was actually an amazing study.
Michigan State Prison looks out by just

3648
02:30:45,201 --> 02:30:46,550
by accident,
no one designed it this way.

3649
02:30:46,551 --> 02:30:50,300
One part of it looks out over just bare
concrete and one part of it looks out

3650
02:30:50,301 --> 02:30:54,160
over like lovely green space and the
people who when the,

3651
02:30:54,170 --> 02:30:55,640
there was just random where you ended
up,

3652
02:30:55,940 --> 02:30:57,590
but the people who looked out over the
concrete,

3653
02:30:57,591 --> 02:31:00,200
we're 23% more likely to develop mental
health problems,

3654
02:31:00,260 --> 02:31:03,410
right?
So this thing about as Isabel says,

3655
02:31:03,411 --> 02:31:07,280
we are animals that were designed to
move through nature.

3656
02:31:07,580 --> 02:31:10,010
If you are not an animal moving through
nature,

3657
02:31:10,190 --> 02:31:13,310
