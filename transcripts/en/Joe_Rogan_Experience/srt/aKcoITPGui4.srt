1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:00,601
Trey,

2
00:00:00,601 --> 00:00:05,601
my daddy Joe Rogan podcast by night all
day round cake man goes to the body to

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,000
it was a domination,

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:14,010
like a total complete domination and
was a strong favorite in this fight.

5
00:00:14,011 --> 00:00:15,120
I Air Max Holloway.

6
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:17,790
Well although number 10 what's up?

7
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:21,450
So let's build the guy up
and that's what I think this

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,450
guy's a killer someday in the future.

9
00:00:24,451 --> 00:00:27,510
I think that's a legit fight and I
think that's an interesting fight.

10
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:28,291
I'm like the flooring.

11
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:30,270
Callaway is a bad motherfucker.

12
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:33,300
Max Holloway is a bad motherfucker.

13
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:34,350
It's a really interesting fight.

14
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,580
I agree with you man.

15
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:37,711
Well Hey,

16
00:00:37,711 --> 00:00:39,930
they made Ferguson could be beneficial

17
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:42,840
for interim title.

18
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:48,380
Everybody getting titles every fight now
from now on will be an interim title.

19
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:49,591
Damn it.

20
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:50,270
That'd be nice.

21
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:50,501
Wait,

22
00:00:50,501 --> 00:00:51,030
Khabib is,

23
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:51,900
I'm sorry they made what?

24
00:00:51,901 --> 00:00:52,734
21st century.

25
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:53,830
Yeah,

26
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:55,350
but they made it as more title,

27
00:00:55,351 --> 00:00:56,430
which I don't understand.

28
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:56,790
Wow.

29
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,050
That's super confusing.

30
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,110
It's very confusing because
Connor just won the title.

31
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:01,380
Uh,

32
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:05,340
see I think this is more of a sign that
comms is going to fight Floyd next cause

33
00:01:05,341 --> 00:01:07,890
he's probably talking to Dana like
you ain't see me anytime soon.

34
00:01:07,891 --> 00:01:12,891
Son or it's more of a sign
that they wanted to have a
pay per view card that was

35
00:01:13,051 --> 00:01:14,820
stacked with championship fights.

36
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:17,580
But if you keep doing interim titles,

37
00:01:17,581 --> 00:01:18,030
people are like,

38
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:18,571
all right,

39
00:01:18,571 --> 00:01:18,950
we get it.

40
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:21,710
Everyone's a fucking wheelchair to
Congress about to have a baby because his

41
00:01:21,711 --> 00:01:22,610
wife's about to have baby.

42
00:01:22,611 --> 00:01:22,840
Correct.

43
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,280
So that's going to be take some time.

44
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:27,360
Well maybe he's not.

45
00:01:27,361 --> 00:01:29,700
I mean he's richer than lots of guys.

46
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:30,740
That's true.

47
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:31,231
I mean he's like,

48
00:01:31,231 --> 00:01:31,441
listen,

49
00:01:31,441 --> 00:01:34,350
I don't want to go through training camp
right now and experienced this first

50
00:01:34,351 --> 00:01:35,340
kid had a baby.

51
00:01:35,341 --> 00:01:36,390
Don't get from training camp.

52
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:36,840
Yeah.

53
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,400
I mean it's a fucking man.

54
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:40,670
Bad asses.

55
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:41,503
Yoyo Rodriguez.

56
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:42,441
Unbelievable.

57
00:01:42,441 --> 00:01:45,510
That's the coming out party
folks Bj had on his back though.

58
00:01:45,511 --> 00:01:49,140
Or is it a product of Bj being basically
a heavy bag in there and I love Bj.

59
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:49,830
It's that,

60
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:50,611
but it's also,

61
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:50,851
look,

62
00:01:50,851 --> 00:01:51,601
I think Bj,

63
00:01:51,601 --> 00:01:53,220
when he was 10 years younger,

64
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:55,410
it would have been a tougher
fight for you out here for sure.

65
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,480
What's interesting for sure,

66
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,373
way tougher fight

67
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:00,663
style.

68
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:01,561
Who fucking knows.

69
00:02:01,561 --> 00:02:02,550
This is the problem though,

70
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,000
is that it's not just a
matter of Bj being a legend.

71
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:08,430
Bj being an all time great
to division world champion,

72
00:02:08,431 --> 00:02:09,810
bad motherfucker without a doubt,

73
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:15,290
but his style is a boxing based attack
and then a vicious ground and pound and

74
00:02:15,571 --> 00:02:16,011
vicious,

75
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:17,400
a top game submission game.

76
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:22,850
Bj is not a guy who submits guys off
his back and Bj is not necessarily a guy

77
00:02:23,461 --> 00:02:24,690
who kicks that much.

78
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,291
So yeah,

79
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:27,240
I hear who's an outstanding kicker,

80
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,320
the best kickers.

81
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,660
He has just this huge advantage.

82
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,330
Do you know what it's
like if you check window,

83
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:36,780
if you had a guy who said
and you box a little bit,

84
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:37,710
if you had a guy that said,

85
00:02:37,711 --> 00:02:38,190
hey,

86
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,030
let's spar,

87
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,680
you can kick and I'll just box.

88
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:41,461
You'd be like,

89
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:42,480
well good luck with all that.

90
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,733
Can I kick your legs?

91
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:44,491
And he'd be like,

92
00:02:44,491 --> 00:02:44,641
yeah.

93
00:02:44,641 --> 00:02:44,910
I'd be like,

94
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:45,031
Oh,

95
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:45,300
well,

96
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,230
well you just,

97
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:47,590
you're going to have a terrible afternoon.

98
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:47,810
Yeah.

99
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:48,360
Terrible.

100
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:48,840
Came over,

101
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,051
right?

102
00:02:49,051 --> 00:02:49,201
Yeah.

103
00:02:49,201 --> 00:02:52,110
You're fucked because
didn't Bj fight didn't,

104
00:02:52,111 --> 00:02:52,771
am I crazy?

105
00:02:52,771 --> 00:02:54,360
Or did he fight a cheetah?

106
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,433
Cheetah.

107
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:55,850
Oh,

108
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:56,820
Christ as a heavyweight.

109
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,830
It's called the Rock and
the rumble on the rock.

110
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:00,970
The Rock in Hawaii.

111
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,770
No,

112
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:02,603
no.

113
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,950
He fought Leonardo in Japan
and rumble on the rock.

114
00:03:05,951 --> 00:03:07,240
He fought Carlos Con.

115
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:07,481
No,

116
00:03:07,481 --> 00:03:11,170
he didn't find Carlos Condit
Lialda and rumble on the rock.

117
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,000
He fought go me.

118
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,120
He beat the fuck out of gummy memory.

119
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,470
Brought Gomi over to rumble.

120
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,720
Beat the shit out of
him and strangle them.

121
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:20,930
You spot somebody else.

122
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,070
I think you find in a,

123
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,680
I'm going to say k one because he
fought Duane Ludwig and k one as well.

124
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:28,410
Yeah,

125
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,100
I thought he fought in rumble.

126
00:03:30,101 --> 00:03:30,850
The Rock.

127
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:31,440
That's crazy.

128
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,020
Hmm.

129
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:32,853
You might be right.

130
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,460
I don't know you that Jamie.

131
00:03:34,461 --> 00:03:39,461
How powerful fucking tie and pocket
handkerchief for Tyron Woodley.

132
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,790
I know all you gotta.

133
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:47,720
You gotta fucking kind of
feel like you're half in less.

134
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,410
George Saint Pierre
comes out of retirement.

135
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,340
Then you make an exception.

136
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,420
But since joy,

137
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,021
oh look at this.

138
00:03:53,021 --> 00:03:54,100
Just as horrible to watch,

139
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:54,271
man.

140
00:03:54,271 --> 00:03:55,870
He's just taking that
left kick to the head.

141
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:56,801
Oh,

142
00:03:56,801 --> 00:03:57,634
the wheel kick.

143
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,870
I mean this is like right away.

144
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,621
Early in the fight.

145
00:03:59,621 --> 00:04:00,431
He's getting staggered.

146
00:04:00,431 --> 00:04:02,060
He's getting his legs
kicked out for longest.

147
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,000
Wme Boys made this macho man,

148
00:04:04,001 --> 00:04:08,670
that three 60 round kick to the night
jumping front kick behind ditch.

149
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:09,940
Oh my God.

150
00:04:09,941 --> 00:04:11,860
To what I hear Rodriguez first,

151
00:04:11,861 --> 00:04:13,240
Brian or take is a fun one.

152
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,940
Look Yahya Rodriguez versus
anyone as a front one.

153
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,620
I mean the kids 24 years old.

154
00:04:17,621 --> 00:04:18,880
Who the fuck knows what happens with ya?

155
00:04:18,881 --> 00:04:19,420
I hear,

156
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:19,601
yeah,

157
00:04:19,601 --> 00:04:21,160
you're might not even stay at 45.

158
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:23,620
He might be stepping up to
55 in the next few years.

159
00:04:23,621 --> 00:04:24,910
Might be the Mexican economy.

160
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,560
He might be the motherfucker.

161
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,300
Take us.

162
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,650
Take us 45 isn't ranked number.

163
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:30,960
He's uh,

164
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,331
he's right.

165
00:04:31,331 --> 00:04:32,164
The head of hair.

166
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:33,003
He's number nine.

167
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:33,401
Dude.

168
00:04:33,401 --> 00:04:36,340
When you say Bj Penn get rocked like that.

169
00:04:36,341 --> 00:04:39,100
You see the legs give out like
on the k one heroes for me.

170
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,083
Where's that at?

171
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,180
Longest active wind streak in
the featherweight division.

172
00:04:43,181 --> 00:04:44,980
Max Holloway giant Joe.

173
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:45,843
You're right.

174
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,360
Yeah,

175
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,171
I think it was k one,

176
00:04:47,171 --> 00:04:47,470
right?

177
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:47,860
Yeah.

178
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,560
And before that it was
a rumble on the rocks.

179
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,180
And who do you find rumble on the
rocks back up a little bit there.

180
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:57,280
UFC go down way down.

181
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,000
Keep going.

182
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,390
Nope,

183
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:58,751
that's fine.

184
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,171
Where are you going?

185
00:04:59,171 --> 00:04:59,740
Me.

186
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,550
He fought tag annoyed.

187
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,840
You [inaudible] fight someone else.

188
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,340
Gracie.

189
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,240
[inaudible]

190
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:06,641
Gracie.

191
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:07,391
That's right.

192
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:08,500
And that was a decision,

193
00:05:08,501 --> 00:05:08,771
right?

194
00:05:08,771 --> 00:05:09,910
That was kind of a boring fight,

195
00:05:09,911 --> 00:05:10,870
if I remember correctly.

196
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:14,910
Powerful Larry landless referee
having seen what kind of did too.

197
00:05:14,911 --> 00:05:15,240
Uh,

198
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:15,660
Eddie Alvarez.

199
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:15,890
What?

200
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:16,601
What is your,

201
00:05:16,601 --> 00:05:18,130
what is your take on Alvarez?

202
00:05:18,131 --> 00:05:19,030
I mean that Conor,

203
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,000
Khabib,

204
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,070
does it matter?

205
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,110
That does that he has to fight Tony.

206
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,020
He's got a fight town.

207
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:24,490
That's a,

208
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,290
you can't just dismiss now you're done.

209
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:28,420
[inaudible] peep guts this.

210
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:29,420
Fuck.

211
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,120
You're right.

212
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:30,401
You're right.

213
00:05:30,401 --> 00:05:31,121
I forgot about that.

214
00:05:31,121 --> 00:05:31,511
That's very,

215
00:05:31,511 --> 00:05:33,190
and you can't ever use MMA math.

216
00:05:33,191 --> 00:05:33,950
Here's why.

217
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:38,350
Rhonda Rousey submit some
Cat Zingano in 14 seconds.

218
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:41,950
Cats and Ganos stops Amanda
Nunez and the third round,

219
00:05:41,951 --> 00:05:45,460
Amanda Nunez Destroys Ronda
Rousey and 48 seconds never,

220
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,180
ever wasn't worth based on
what that matchup styles.

221
00:05:49,181 --> 00:05:49,930
It's one on one.

222
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:52,450
It's like when you using that translator
thing that I told you about and you

223
00:05:52,451 --> 00:05:53,400
read things correctly,

224
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:54,503
Ferguson is,

225
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,070
the floor is nasty.

226
00:05:59,071 --> 00:05:59,900
He's such a bad ass.

227
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:00,050
How,

228
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:00,950
what a great picture,

229
00:06:00,951 --> 00:06:01,221
man.

230
00:06:01,221 --> 00:06:02,031
That guy is awesome.

231
00:06:02,031 --> 00:06:03,140
He's so fucking good,

232
00:06:03,141 --> 00:06:03,291
man.

233
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:07,010
He's the best boss logic to that guy.

234
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,281
Yeah,

235
00:06:07,281 --> 00:06:08,114
man.

236
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:17,160
Okay.
