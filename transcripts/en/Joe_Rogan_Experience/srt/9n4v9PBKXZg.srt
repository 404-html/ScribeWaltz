1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:04,890
Natasha luxury rogue
drinking healthy green juice.

2
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:06,640
Oh,

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,111
I drink.

4
00:00:07,111 --> 00:00:07,651
That's tough.

5
00:00:07,651 --> 00:00:08,071
That's tough.

6
00:00:08,071 --> 00:00:08,904
Is Yummy.

7
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:09,990
It's good for you.

8
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,880
Look at you all healthy and shit.

9
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:12,961
I mean,

10
00:00:12,961 --> 00:00:13,750
doing yoga,

11
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:14,850
drinking juice.

12
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:15,691
I mean,

13
00:00:15,691 --> 00:00:19,080
I also smoked pot and drank and
those are good things at all.

14
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:20,431
Yeah.

15
00:00:20,431 --> 00:00:21,250
It's like who said that?

16
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:22,083
Oliver Wilde,

17
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:23,310
all things in moderation,

18
00:00:23,311 --> 00:00:24,390
including moderation.

19
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:26,303
Oscar Wilde.

20
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:27,370
Was it?

21
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:28,203
Yes,

22
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:29,060
I was at right.

23
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:29,940
That's Oliver Wilde.

24
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:35,050
Did I say 1130 my brand is useless till
about 3:00 PM I made you come earlier.

25
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:37,570
Say overwhelmed.

26
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:37,701
Yeah.

27
00:00:37,701 --> 00:00:38,880
Well I've been up.

28
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:40,270
I've been up.

29
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:41,103
I got up early today.

30
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:42,143
You got kids?

31
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:42,810
Yeah,

32
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:43,171
kids.

33
00:00:43,171 --> 00:00:44,280
But I went to Yoga class.

34
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:44,881
Oh,

35
00:00:44,881 --> 00:00:45,700
you went today?

36
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:45,860
Yeah,

37
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:46,051
yeah,

38
00:00:46,051 --> 00:00:46,884
yeah,

39
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:47,701
yeah.

40
00:00:47,701 --> 00:00:48,534
Eight o'clock class.

41
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,580
They have like 5:00 AM classes.

42
00:00:50,581 --> 00:00:50,821
I'm like,

43
00:00:50,821 --> 00:00:52,810
who's taking a five amp crim class?

44
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:53,670
I know.

45
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:54,580
I kind of want to go.

46
00:00:54,581 --> 00:00:57,240
Just fucking Weirdos

47
00:00:58,970 --> 00:00:59,551
that I'm like,

48
00:00:59,551 --> 00:01:04,290
who is getting up at 5:00 AM for an
90 minute class and where I live,

49
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,450
they pump up the heat too much.

50
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:07,340
They had this like,

51
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:11,200
they have this sort of vibe of
like they want to torture you.

52
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:12,943
You know,

53
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:14,970
it's an ordeal.

54
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,170
You're getting through an ordeal.

55
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:18,090
It's way more difficult
than anybody thinks it is.

56
00:01:18,091 --> 00:01:20,070
Like you drive by these
little fucking boxes,

57
00:01:20,071 --> 00:01:20,904
these rooms,

58
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,090
and nobody knows the kind of punishment
that's going on in those places.

59
00:01:24,091 --> 00:01:26,550
Everybody thinks it's like
a bunch of housewives,

60
00:01:26,551 --> 00:01:29,220
like stretching and
holding onto their toes.

61
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:36,180
Chowder is raping his students and they're
all getting $12 an hour to like teach

62
00:01:37,321 --> 00:01:38,154
us

63
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,320
nothing to teach us.

64
00:01:40,321 --> 00:01:41,300
And he's been,

65
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,790
I think accused of rape 17 times.

66
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:45,091
Well,

67
00:01:45,091 --> 00:01:46,200
let's Google it.

68
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,940
It's more than one.

69
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,910
Certainly that's an issue,

70
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:51,240
right?

71
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:51,810
Whenever,

72
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:52,051
I mean,

73
00:01:52,051 --> 00:01:53,160
if one person says,

74
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:53,730
hey,

75
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:54,563
Jamie,

76
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,650
the sexual encounter we
had was unpleasant for me.

77
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:00,150
I think you may be a rapist.

78
00:02:00,151 --> 00:02:01,230
I'm calling the fucking cops.

79
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:02,061
That's,

80
00:02:02,061 --> 00:02:02,850
you know,

81
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,470
there's some wiggle room there.

82
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,140
But when it's more the hotline numbers,

83
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,730
those are big numbers,

84
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:09,913
big numbers.

85
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,840
It's so hard to get 30
people to agree to law

86
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,950
unless they're working
for the CIA or something.

87
00:02:16,951 --> 00:02:18,090
How many people has he

88
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,720
a new cases filed February 13th bringing
the total number of civil lawsuits,

89
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,730
civil lawsuits.

90
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:27,421
What does that mean?

91
00:02:27,421 --> 00:02:28,290
What about criminal?

92
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:29,020
Uh,

93
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:29,461
okay.

94
00:02:29,461 --> 00:02:34,060
It says claims he raped her during
the 2010 teacher training or

95
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:38,100
five other allegations
span over two years,

96
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,720
including another rape charge from,

97
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:43,530
it's always depressing when it's the
people who are like the spiritual leaders.

98
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,140
Super Common.

99
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,770
I know anytime you try to repress things,

100
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,500
but I mean I don't even,

101
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:54,030
I mean he's allowed to have sex,

102
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:54,860
right.

103
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:55,710
Allowed to like

104
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,470
use their dicks as weapons.

105
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,480
What about Pat Benatar?

106
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,040
What does she is as a weapon?

107
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,620
A weapon that I'd see.

108
00:03:04,621 --> 00:03:05,291
I think it's different.

109
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:06,520
One woman when live on music,

110
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,180
I'm sorry.

111
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,260
I really do.

112
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:13,720
Because men have the upper body strength
and they had this thing specifically

113
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,980
have upper body strength.

114
00:03:14,981 --> 00:03:19,090
Look at you and then you had this thing
that gets hard and then it inserts right

115
00:03:19,091 --> 00:03:21,160
into the woman as an act of violence.

116
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:25,180
It's very rude and seemed
convenient and golfing,

117
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,880
golfing and penetrating are two
completely different things,

118
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:28,300
right?

119
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,410
Because the woman and Golfs,

120
00:03:29,411 --> 00:03:29,981
but she can't,

121
00:03:29,981 --> 00:03:30,940
she's not the aggressor.

122
00:03:30,941 --> 00:03:31,774
She's receptive.

123
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,190
If someone grabs your finger
and starts sucking it,

124
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:35,261
come on,

125
00:03:35,261 --> 00:03:35,521
man,

126
00:03:35,521 --> 00:03:36,430
what are you doing on my finger?

127
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,293
It's not that big a deal,

128
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:43,390
but if someone grabs their finger
and stuffs it in your mouth,

129
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,441
you're like,

130
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:45,274
whoa,

131
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,360
that's kind of fucked up.

132
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,021
It's different.

133
00:03:47,021 --> 00:03:48,250
Although there is female rape,

134
00:03:48,251 --> 00:03:49,570
I watched a documentary on it.

135
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,411
Oh yeah,

136
00:03:50,411 --> 00:03:51,080
there is

137
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:51,913
women.

138
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,150
You know what they do though?

139
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:58,180
They the rape other women and they get
on their face so a woman will sit on the

140
00:03:59,451 --> 00:04:02,720
other woman's face so she
can't breathe and like get off.

141
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:03,060
Hmm.

142
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,490
And I think that's what
I saw it on Netflix.

143
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:07,320
Well female rape.

144
00:04:07,321 --> 00:04:10,970
I think we would have to look at
each of those on an individual basis.

145
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:14,730
I mean I wouldn't want some woman
to force her pussy on my face.

146
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,610
That's what I'm saying.

147
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,860
That as one aggressive lesbian.

148
00:04:19,861 --> 00:04:20,730
The problem is,

149
00:04:20,731 --> 00:04:24,420
I think there's probably some
women that like a little of that,

150
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:25,683
probably some like,

151
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:26,551
look,

152
00:04:26,551 --> 00:04:30,480
there's all sorts of sexual appetites
and I know there's guys I know guys don't

153
00:04:30,481 --> 00:04:32,400
like to be smacked around and tied up.

154
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,300
I have a friend who likes
doing that fucking weird shit.

155
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:37,101
Oh yeah.

156
00:04:37,101 --> 00:04:38,480
I used to work for a dominatrix.

157
00:04:38,481 --> 00:04:40,670
I wasn't like working
for her as a Dominatrix,

158
00:04:40,671 --> 00:04:41,211
but she,

159
00:04:41,211 --> 00:04:43,920
I worked in her clothing store
and she was also a Dominatrix,

160
00:04:43,921 --> 00:04:46,970
this German woman and she
would go piss on people.

161
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,070
She would just like,

162
00:04:49,071 --> 00:04:51,940
it was so funny and she had this
crazy accent and she'd answer,

163
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:52,160
you know,

164
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,390
one line she was ordering,

165
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:53,841
you know,

166
00:04:53,841 --> 00:04:55,340
fabric and then the other line she's like,

167
00:04:55,341 --> 00:04:56,174
what are you into?

168
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,500
Do you want me to jog around the block?

169
00:04:57,501 --> 00:04:58,460
You want my feet smelly?

170
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:00,620
She always like,

171
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:04,220
and then she had a guy
who had like his thing,

172
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,960
she would tell me about it all.

173
00:05:05,961 --> 00:05:08,150
She had a guy who all he wanted to do,

174
00:05:08,151 --> 00:05:11,360
she had to wear white underwear and he
just wanted to use a flashlight and look

175
00:05:11,361 --> 00:05:12,980
up her skirt for like an hour.

176
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,300
She would get paid so much.

177
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:17,840
At one time I went over to her house to
get paid and she had a man blind folded

178
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:21,770
on the floor crawling and he was just
smelling her boots while she was writing

179
00:05:21,771 --> 00:05:22,604
me a check.

180
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:24,800
I mean it was,

181
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,790
it never ended.

182
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:26,810
It was so funny.

183
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,200
But that's all voluntary.

184
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:29,520
So that's where it gets weird.

185
00:05:29,521 --> 00:05:30,420
It's like they're paying,

186
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,310
they're paying and they want to do it.

187
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,630
It's like that's their thing.

188
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,240
It's like I just did a girl
who liked to get choked.

189
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,021
That was her thing.

190
00:05:37,021 --> 00:05:38,100
She so I didn't,

191
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,450
I don't like doing that.

192
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,070
I don't want well cause
you're still strong.

193
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:45,840
It's one thing when you ask them emo
guide a chunk or some like scared dude.

194
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:49,860
But when you asked him guy who
like clearly could strangle you,

195
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,980
maybe it only with 10% of your strength.

196
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:54,780
I use good technique.

197
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,023
I know what I'm doing.

198
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,160
But

199
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,580
I didn't,

200
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:58,971
I don't,

201
00:05:58,971 --> 00:05:59,570
I don't,

202
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:00,770
I don't want to connect.

203
00:06:00,771 --> 00:06:02,960
I never wanted to connect
those two things together.

204
00:06:02,961 --> 00:06:04,850
Like I'm not in the sex violence,

205
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,810
but it's not.

206
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:06,440
And um,

207
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,100
I don't,

208
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,720
I think you could get into anything.

209
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:09,830
And when I was in high school,

210
00:06:09,831 --> 00:06:10,730
I've talked about this before,

211
00:06:10,731 --> 00:06:13,970
I had this girl that used to like rub my
dick where their feet and I had a foot

212
00:06:13,971 --> 00:06:17,720
fetish for a little bit just for a
little bit like not nothing crazy,

213
00:06:17,721 --> 00:06:22,721
but it lasted for a while cause I think
like I connected feet with sexuality for

214
00:06:23,781 --> 00:06:25,430
a while because of this one girl.

215
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:29,180
I think if you start
choking people like that,

216
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:29,920
that could happen.

217
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,820
If you date someone who really likes that.

218
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,860
And this girl used to say
choked me like I can't,

219
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:34,820
I'm not going to choke you.

220
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:35,720
And I'm like,

221
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,553
I'm not going to do this.

222
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:37,700
I can't do it.

223
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,390
I'm not going to do it.

224
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,223
Do it a little.

225
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:39,591
She's like,

226
00:06:39,591 --> 00:06:41,450
took me who I'm not going to do it.

227
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,070
You know,

228
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,820
in the wrestling match choker,

229
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,291
like,

230
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:47,124
you know,

231
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,060
just enough.

232
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:48,720
Just enough.

233
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,500
Just a little bit.

234
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,281
I don't need to teach you,

235
00:06:50,281 --> 00:06:51,360
but I'm just saying

236
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,890
some girls like it too much.

237
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:57,600
But my point being is that if you got
into that and then you dated a girl who is

238
00:06:57,601 --> 00:06:58,650
not into it at all,

239
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:00,060
he started choking her.

240
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:00,870
She'd be like,

241
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:04,710
I can't be comfortable with
you now because I'm thinking
you're going to fucking

242
00:07:04,711 --> 00:07:05,544
choke me,

243
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:06,150
Ya know?

244
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:06,541
Right.

245
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:07,500
That's a good point.

246
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:10,890
Do you know that guy that's getting
accused of beating up women?

247
00:07:10,891 --> 00:07:13,950
He was a host of the CBC radio show.

248
00:07:13,951 --> 00:07:15,570
His name is John Ghomeshi.

249
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:15,901
Yes,

250
00:07:15,901 --> 00:07:16,734
I read about it.

251
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:16,970
Yeah,

252
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:17,803
he's,

253
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:20,430
what's amazing is this
guy was like a feminist,

254
00:07:20,431 --> 00:07:21,264
allegedly.

255
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:26,480
You know Mr Social Justice Warrior type
guy talked really calmly like this.

256
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:30,180
He was one of those guys who
would talk about women's issues.

257
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:34,260
Let's talk about women's issues and just
beat the fuck out of girls in his spare

258
00:07:34,261 --> 00:07:34,850
time.

259
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,090
Like allegedly,

260
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,410
I should say allegedly,

261
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:38,610
but there's multiple counts.

262
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:38,951
Yeah.

263
00:07:38,951 --> 00:07:41,710
You don't want to believe that Jimmy
Hendrix hit some girl with a telephone.

264
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:42,041
Listen,

265
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:43,840
we were talking about
that before the show.

266
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,440
She was telling me that Jimi
Hendrix had his wife and I see,

267
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:46,961
first of all,

268
00:07:46,961 --> 00:07:47,500
never heard,

269
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,250
never married.

270
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,530
And the only time Mr.
Hendricks was ever in trouble,

271
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,031
listen,

272
00:07:51,031 --> 00:07:52,000
God damn Canada,

273
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,770
and I told us fucking Canadians,

274
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,790
if you want the good music,

275
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:56,290
you got to let Jimmy bring the heroin end.

276
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,710
Can't be arrested him at the border.

277
00:07:59,290 --> 00:07:59,710
Yeah.

278
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:01,420
I mean he's just so cool and unique.

279
00:08:01,421 --> 00:08:02,670
There's never been anyone else like,

280
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:02,970
yeah.

281
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:03,801
Since then either.

282
00:08:03,801 --> 00:08:06,650
There's been a few guys that have
kind of taken that vibe a little bit,

283
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,290
but

284
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:07,990
he was the motto.

285
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:08,750
Any crab that's,

286
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,583
I'm leaving

287
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:14,630
Oliver while I was going
to say Gary Clark Jr,

288
00:08:14,631 --> 00:08:15,080
is that all right?

289
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:15,920
I don't know who that is.

290
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:16,330
Oh,

291
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,060
how dare you.

292
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:17,893
He's amazing.

293
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:18,800
He's actually really good,

294
00:08:18,801 --> 00:08:19,510
but he doesn't have that.

295
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,630
He's got his own vibe,

296
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,120
but he's just a really good
guitarist and he happens to be black

297
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:23,801
since,

298
00:08:23,801 --> 00:08:24,100
you know.

299
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:24,311
Wait,

300
00:08:24,311 --> 00:08:25,870
so what was Jimmy's shelf life like?

301
00:08:25,871 --> 00:08:27,100
Was he around for five years?

302
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,061
It wasn't around very long.

303
00:08:28,061 --> 00:08:30,680
You died at 27 he was
one of those 27 guys.

304
00:08:30,681 --> 00:08:31,514
Yeah.

305
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:31,811
You know,

306
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:32,600
there's a lot,

307
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,220
a lot of weird shit that's been going
on lately where people have come out and

308
00:08:36,221 --> 00:08:37,450
said that he was killed.

309
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:38,140
His,

310
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,670
his girlfriend at the time,

311
00:08:39,671 --> 00:08:40,660
who's with him when he died,

312
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:45,840
she jumped off of a building and Soho
and this guy who wrote this book who like

313
00:08:46,421 --> 00:08:51,421
a bodyguard or worked for Jimi Hendrix
manager said that Jimmy Hendrix was

314
00:08:51,881 --> 00:08:55,440
killed by his manager and so was the
girlfriend cause she knew too much and it

315
00:08:55,441 --> 00:08:56,191
sounds like bullshit,

316
00:08:56,191 --> 00:08:58,260
but he was actually kidnapped.

317
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,320
Jimi Hendrix was kidnapped for a couple
days and his manager is the one who got

318
00:09:04,021 --> 00:09:08,790
him free and they said that what happened
was Jimmy was thinking about leaving

319
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:09,624
his manager.

320
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:13,650
So his manager had Jimmy kidnapped and
then made it look like he was rescuing

321
00:09:13,651 --> 00:09:14,250
him.

322
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,083
Do you believe that?

323
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,400
Yeah.

324
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:16,900
I mean

325
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:17,531
I don't have,

326
00:09:17,531 --> 00:09:18,400
I do killed.

327
00:09:18,401 --> 00:09:21,010
Who was like such an industry
making you so much money.

328
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,960
If the guy was going to leave you and
you had a life insurance policy against

329
00:09:23,961 --> 00:09:24,794
it,

330
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:25,550
have you?

331
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,110
I mean it is possible evil.

332
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,460
Well that's what everybody said.

333
00:09:28,461 --> 00:09:29,061
That shook night.

334
00:09:29,061 --> 00:09:29,720
Did.

335
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:34,370
I mean I don't think it's beyond the
realm of possibility that people who are

336
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,080
mean evil,

337
00:09:36,081 --> 00:09:36,980
crazy fucks.

338
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:41,120
He'll make a lot of money off artists
like Jimi Hendrix manager allegedly did,

339
00:09:41,121 --> 00:09:42,320
would be willing to do that.

340
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,343
I mean there's always been,

341
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,760
there's always been like organized crime
ties to music and and to artists is

342
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:52,320
just so much money involved and
having a guy like Hendrix with you if,

343
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:53,570
if he's going to leave you,

344
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:55,250
we got Phil Spector.

345
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:57,680
Remember that guy who
shot that fucking woman?

346
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:01,430
He was always in it like he was a guy
that like produce the Beatles songs and

347
00:10:01,431 --> 00:10:04,310
that guy was apparently always into
putting guns in people's mouths.

348
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:05,521
Like that was his thing.

349
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:05,640
Right.

350
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,390
Feels like a power thing that maybe he
was like he just got too powerful as

351
00:10:09,391 --> 00:10:10,680
opposed to being evil.

352
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:13,420
I think it's pretty evil
to shoot some of the mouth.

353
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:14,291
Yeah,

354
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:15,220
that's true.

355
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:15,700
I know,

356
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,720
I see your point.

357
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,040
I could see it both ways.

358
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:23,050
I could see it being a bullshit story
that someone wrote long after Jimi Hendrix

359
00:10:23,051 --> 00:10:23,860
was dead.

360
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:27,520
This guy decides Cashin I'll just make
some ridiculous claims and I'll make some

361
00:10:27,521 --> 00:10:28,354
money.

362
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:29,403
It's possible.

363
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:29,840
You know,

364
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,210
there's no one knows.

365
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,830
No one knows other than
the people involved.

366
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,180
Do you think people are evil?

367
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,310
I think some people are evil.

368
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,013
What do you think?

369
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:38,511
I Dunno.

370
00:10:38,511 --> 00:10:39,161
I was just thinking like,

371
00:10:39,161 --> 00:10:39,311
yeah,

372
00:10:39,311 --> 00:10:40,750
I was thinking of like Tony Soprano.

373
00:10:40,751 --> 00:10:41,540
He's someone who he is,

374
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:44,710
you've seen depicted like
he would kill someone.

375
00:10:44,711 --> 00:10:44,951
Right.

376
00:10:44,951 --> 00:10:45,180
And like,

377
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:45,851
but then he liked,

378
00:10:45,851 --> 00:10:49,000
they justify it all cause they love their
family and they pay for their family.

379
00:10:49,001 --> 00:10:50,830
So I'm just thinking like they must have,

380
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,180
they must defend their lives.

381
00:10:52,181 --> 00:10:54,370
I wonder how evil people
defend their lives.

382
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:55,680
I don't think they have to.

383
00:10:55,681 --> 00:10:55,861
I mean,

384
00:10:55,861 --> 00:10:56,530
what about king

385
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:57,610
do themselves?

386
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:58,061
Yeah,

387
00:10:58,061 --> 00:10:58,894
I know

388
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,720
he shot someone with an antiaircraft gun.

389
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:05,860
The story is that someone was,

390
00:11:05,861 --> 00:11:06,670
um,

391
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:07,690
he was making a speech.

392
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,310
Some guy fell asleep during a speech.

393
00:11:09,311 --> 00:11:11,320
So you shot him with an antiaircraft gun.

394
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,520
Really?

395
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,353
That was the story.

396
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:13,810
I mean,

397
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:14,860
obviously no one knows.

398
00:11:14,861 --> 00:11:16,870
But he definitely killed his uncle.

399
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,630
He killed his uncle and his uncle's sons.

400
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,381
So,

401
00:11:20,381 --> 00:11:20,740
uh,

402
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:24,970
that his son's couldn't avenge his uncle
because they were planning on some sort

403
00:11:24,971 --> 00:11:25,580
of a cool,

404
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,050
so it's like a mobster vibe.

405
00:11:27,051 --> 00:11:27,741
Like they're just like,

406
00:11:27,741 --> 00:11:30,560
I'll kill people for my betterment.

407
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,200
Hmm.

408
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:31,680
Well,

409
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,000
I mean it's a dictator vibe.

410
00:11:33,001 --> 00:11:34,230
It's some game of Thrones shit.

411
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:34,830
I mean,

412
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,750
that is exactly what's
going on over there.

413
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:38,850
Minus the dragons and the white walkers.

414
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:40,980
I can't watch that show.

415
00:11:40,981 --> 00:11:41,461
I'm sorry.

416
00:11:41,461 --> 00:11:42,294
I'm the only one.

417
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:44,640
There should be like a group for us.

418
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:45,503
What's the matter?

419
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:46,710
Uh,

420
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:47,790
like Howard Kramer,

421
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:48,241
he calls him,

422
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:51,120
make them ups and that's Kinda how I feel.

423
00:11:51,121 --> 00:11:51,601
Like I'm not,

424
00:11:51,601 --> 00:11:52,050
I can't,

425
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:52,883
I can't hold my,

426
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:55,030
what do you mean by make moves?

427
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,500
And it's just like fantasy,

428
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,210
right?

429
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:57,630
It's like,

430
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:59,050
it doesn't appeal to me.

431
00:11:59,110 --> 00:11:59,860
What do you like?

432
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,120
I like documentaries.

433
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,470
I like things based in reality.

434
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:03,900
I like character driven dramas.

435
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,370
And I like funny comedies.

436
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,500
I don't like dragons and
people whose mission,

437
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,100
your hands become machine guns.

438
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,310
I just can't get into it.

439
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:16,051
It,

440
00:12:16,051 --> 00:12:17,800
it speaks nothing to me of my life.

441
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:18,820
I can appreciate that.

442
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:19,683
Okay,

443
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:20,770
but you,

444
00:12:20,771 --> 00:12:22,960
but you question whether
or not people are evil.

445
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:24,070
Oh,

446
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:24,431
well tell,

447
00:12:24,431 --> 00:12:24,641
I mean,

448
00:12:24,641 --> 00:12:25,230
yeah,

449
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:25,960
I guess I can't,

450
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:29,070
I'd like to question that
and things that I can un un,

451
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:29,411
you know,

452
00:12:29,411 --> 00:12:30,430
things that I can get with.

453
00:12:30,431 --> 00:12:33,940
I'm sure that game of Thrones
addresses these deeper issues.

454
00:12:33,941 --> 00:12:37,120
If I were to be able to get
past all the names and the,

455
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:38,410
you know,

456
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:39,630
the fantasies and the,

457
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,640
the nonsense nonsense.

458
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:46,920
Winter lasts 10 years.

459
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,490
Don't know how many years.

460
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,740
Maybe it's because I
didn't have a childhood.

461
00:12:50,741 --> 00:12:52,630
I can't get into fantasy childhood.

462
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,450
I mean I was just always like the,

463
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:55,523
the mom,

464
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,041
you know what I mean?

465
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:58,120
So maybe I can't like,

466
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:01,150
well I was the oldest,

467
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:02,340
oldest sisters,

468
00:13:02,341 --> 00:13:05,980
so I like took care of my
brothers and my parents,

469
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:06,341
you know,

470
00:13:06,341 --> 00:13:08,500
it was like not a fun childhood.

471
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:13,680
So maybe like I don't feel
like my imagination or my
ability to lose myself in

472
00:13:14,531 --> 00:13:16,120
fantasy has been like,

473
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:20,380
it's been stunted or something where
your parents not paying attention or they

474
00:13:20,381 --> 00:13:21,370
just needed your help.

475
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,540
I mean they were just working.

476
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,940
And so then I was like the,

477
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:24,873
the mom

478
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:26,800
siblings,

479
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,630
like five years old,

480
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:28,463
five years old.

481
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,630
So you were the one who's kind of
responsible for keeping them kind of,

482
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:33,431
I guess.

483
00:13:33,431 --> 00:13:33,641
I mean,

484
00:13:33,641 --> 00:13:34,990
it wasn't a terrible childhood,

485
00:13:34,991 --> 00:13:36,250
but just wasn't fun.

486
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,770
I was just like looking at the clock,

487
00:13:38,771 --> 00:13:40,450
like let's wrap this up.

488
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,850
Constant babysitter.

489
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:43,863
Yeah.

490
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:47,680
Like cooking and cleaning
and like getting in trouble.

491
00:13:47,681 --> 00:13:48,010
Like,

492
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:48,843
you know,

493
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:50,020
well like not being,

494
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:50,381
yeah,

495
00:13:50,381 --> 00:13:51,310
like being grounded.

496
00:13:51,311 --> 00:13:52,300
I was grounded a lot,

497
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:54,340
climbing out the window,

498
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,860
trying to get some action.

499
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:56,803
And again,

500
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,150
I'd be juicing,

501
00:13:58,151 --> 00:13:58,481
you know,

502
00:13:58,481 --> 00:13:59,350
and need to get fucked.

503
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,240
Climb out a window.

504
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,293
Fuck some dude

505
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,030
climbed back in.

506
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:12,820
I mean,

507
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,860
I think everyone had a
bad childhood though.

508
00:14:14,861 --> 00:14:16,190
Pretty much anyone funny.

509
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:16,811
Yeah.

510
00:14:16,811 --> 00:14:19,600
Like I remember listening to some
Deepak Chopra thing and he was like,

511
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:22,360
imagine yourself as a child
by the beach with your family.

512
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,620
And it was just like one of the,

513
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:25,060
one of the good times in your life.

514
00:14:25,061 --> 00:14:25,570
And I was like,

515
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:25,871
oh,

516
00:14:25,871 --> 00:14:26,800
like to some people,

517
00:14:26,801 --> 00:14:31,540
like their childhood was this dreamland
of like where they're safe and

518
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:32,171
beautiful.

519
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:33,004
And everything,

520
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:34,143
you know?

521
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,280
And I find that people like that,

522
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,300
that have these ideas of like childhood,

523
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:40,960
they're the rare ones.

524
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,153
Yeah,

525
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,091
it's a gift.

526
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:43,331
I mean,

527
00:14:43,331 --> 00:14:43,431
I,

528
00:14:43,431 --> 00:14:44,710
I'll help if I have a child,

529
00:14:44,711 --> 00:14:46,780
I'm sure your children
have this experience.

530
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,250
I'm sure when your children grow up,

531
00:14:48,251 --> 00:14:48,791
they're going to be like,

532
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:51,380
remember when they took us to
this amazing forest or that,

533
00:14:51,381 --> 00:14:51,561
you know,

534
00:14:51,561 --> 00:14:54,560
I'm sure you take your kids
to like beautiful places,

535
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:55,040
right?

536
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,180
Where they have experiences,

537
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:56,680
jog,

538
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,530
worry about that.

539
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:57,960
Well,

540
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,471
they're coming,

541
00:14:58,471 --> 00:15:00,000
they're coming along great so far.

542
00:15:00,001 --> 00:15:02,740
But I worry that that might like,

543
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,830
they're not encountering any adversity,

544
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:06,270
like really well.

545
00:15:06,271 --> 00:15:06,901
I mean they are,

546
00:15:06,901 --> 00:15:09,090
I guess socially at school
there's always like,

547
00:15:09,091 --> 00:15:09,391
you know,

548
00:15:09,391 --> 00:15:12,150
Debbie's a mean bitch and
she doesn't say bitch,

549
00:15:12,151 --> 00:15:13,020
but you know,

550
00:15:13,021 --> 00:15:13,320
there's,

551
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,310
there's that kind of shit.

552
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:14,600
No.

553
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,010
When we have trauma with kids,

554
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:16,731
two daughters.

555
00:15:16,731 --> 00:15:17,180
Yeah.

556
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:20,330
My friend has two daughters and one is
really good at the piano and one can't

557
00:15:20,331 --> 00:15:21,080
play it.

558
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:21,621
And she's,

559
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:23,000
and I was saying how good the one was.

560
00:15:23,001 --> 00:15:23,241
She goes,

561
00:15:23,241 --> 00:15:24,890
you need to say the
other one's just as good.

562
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:26,271
And I was like,

563
00:15:26,271 --> 00:15:27,104
but she's not as,

564
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,430
I mean I didn't say this,

565
00:15:28,431 --> 00:15:29,240
but it was like,

566
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:29,511
wait,

567
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,430
well one of them has talent
and one of them doesn't it.

568
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,550
We tell all the kids,

569
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,560
they all have the same amount of talent.

570
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:40,280
Like I specifically remember
an art teacher telling me
maybe art isn't my thing

571
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:43,850
and it made me try harder
and be more of an artist.

572
00:15:43,851 --> 00:15:44,541
She'd get fired.

573
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:45,374
No,

574
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,031
I know.

575
00:15:47,031 --> 00:15:47,870
But it helped.

576
00:15:47,871 --> 00:15:50,510
It helped create like drive in me.

577
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,470
Well that's done a good way to do it.

578
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,430
Why I'm successful.

579
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:55,960
I've worked with you.

580
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,020
But it is an unusual set of circumstances.

581
00:15:59,021 --> 00:15:59,980
You were independent,

582
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:00,921
you were already,

583
00:16:00,921 --> 00:16:02,440
you had a lot of responsibility.

584
00:16:02,441 --> 00:16:04,960
You realized you had to kind of
pull yourself up by your bootstraps.

585
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:07,300
So when presented with
criticism like that,

586
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:08,740
you kind of responded like,

587
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:09,430
Oh yeah,

588
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:10,810
I'll fucking show you bitch.

589
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,210
And then you went out and got good at art.

590
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:15,790
Whereas some people just
would get really discouraged.

591
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:17,500
Whereas someone could come along and say,

592
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:18,940
you could be good at art,

593
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:20,020
but this is what you're
going to have to do.

594
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:21,070
If you really want to be good at it.

595
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:24,070
And they could recognize that and then
move forward in a positive way that might

596
00:16:24,071 --> 00:16:26,200
work on it would work on more people,

597
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:27,820
would work on more people.

598
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,190
But see it's like the things that work on.

599
00:16:30,191 --> 00:16:32,620
Some people don't work on other people.

600
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,680
I had a shitty art teacher and a,

601
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:38,640
I was really good artist when I was a
kid and my art teacher in high school,

602
00:16:38,641 --> 00:16:40,060
it's just so negative.

603
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:47,580
They're jealous sometimes or a lot
of them are jealous of youth and also

604
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:48,963
natural.

605
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:50,771
Yeah.

606
00:16:50,771 --> 00:16:52,600
My guy was not very talented.

607
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:53,581
Like he,

608
00:16:53,581 --> 00:16:54,580
he would draw,

609
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:56,890
he would draw things like in class,

610
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:57,371
you know,

611
00:16:57,371 --> 00:16:59,650
like we would all work on stuff
and he would work on stuff.

612
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:00,760
And I remember looking at him,

613
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,020
there's this kid in my class,

614
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,060
I always wondered what happened to
him cause he was the most talented.

615
00:17:04,061 --> 00:17:06,160
He was more talented than me as kidney.

616
00:17:06,161 --> 00:17:09,460
I think his name was John Devor and I
always hope that he had gone to become a

617
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:10,151
famous artist,

618
00:17:10,151 --> 00:17:11,860
but I'd never heard of him
should probably look them up.

619
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:13,263
But um,

620
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,730
it was him that I always
admired and it was this kid,

621
00:17:15,731 --> 00:17:16,360
Kevin,

622
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,190
who's in this class was really good too.

623
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:21,100
And then I felt like it was
like the third most talented,

624
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,353
but we were all,

625
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:23,741
it wasn't bad,

626
00:17:23,741 --> 00:17:24,700
but I was pretty good.

627
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:25,780
I drew,

628
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,730
I was like in the comic book stuff,

629
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:30,430
but we were all better than the teacher

630
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:32,970
and I'm not bullshitting.

631
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:33,270
I'm,

632
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:34,680
I'm being totally honest.

633
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,080
Public school teacher for art.

634
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:37,501
I mean,

635
00:17:37,501 --> 00:17:38,334
that's like,

636
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:39,690
it seems like that'd be a pretty,

637
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:41,580
I think either of us could
go get that job right now.

638
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:41,901
Well,

639
00:17:41,901 --> 00:17:44,270
I stopped when I was 15 or 16.

640
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,320
I think it was the last,

641
00:17:45,321 --> 00:17:45,810
uh,

642
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:49,040
like my parents were really freaked out
by it too because I didn't want to take

643
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:49,710
art anymore.

644
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:49,981
I was like,

645
00:17:49,981 --> 00:17:50,814
I don't want to do it anymore.

646
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,040
I kept drawing on my own,

647
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:54,990
but I completely stopped
taking art classes.

648
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:55,530
Like this guy,

649
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:57,090
just a fucking idiot.

650
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:57,953
It just,

651
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,370
the classes were just,

652
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:03,000
it was tedious and the energy was like,

653
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,620
he was just a really,

654
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,060
he was probably depressed,

655
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:06,930
you know?

656
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:08,160
I mean he had a pot belly.

657
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,440
I remember he had this like gut,

658
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,760
it was a depressing gut.

659
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:12,231
Like,

660
00:18:12,231 --> 00:18:12,431
you know,

661
00:18:12,431 --> 00:18:14,520
it's probably a drinking gut,

662
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:15,240
you know,

663
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,600
they like portrayed like they
don't belong on the person.

664
00:18:17,601 --> 00:18:18,331
It says gross.

665
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:18,511
Yeah.

666
00:18:18,511 --> 00:18:20,730
Well he just said no energy and no life.

667
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,440
And if you had life in you,

668
00:18:22,441 --> 00:18:23,370
he wanted to squash it.

669
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:27,300
He wanted to throw a wet blankets on
whatever fire you had inside of you.

670
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,740
This is who is really weird.

671
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,510
Like I talked to the
other two guys about it.

672
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:34,590
I remember specifically like this guy and
the Guy John who was the most talented

673
00:18:34,591 --> 00:18:34,711
guy.

674
00:18:34,711 --> 00:18:34,950
I was like,

675
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:35,490
hmm.

676
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,470
That was his attitude
is like fuck this guy.

677
00:18:37,471 --> 00:18:38,100
Who Cares?

678
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:38,933
He just,

679
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:39,360
you know,

680
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,171
kinda like raises,

681
00:18:40,171 --> 00:18:40,591
eyebrows,

682
00:18:40,591 --> 00:18:41,240
whatever.

683
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,010
So do you worry that your children will
encounter people like that at school?

684
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:44,400
Yeah,

685
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,233
I'm sure they will.

686
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,133
I'm sure they will.

687
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:46,411
You know,

688
00:18:46,411 --> 00:18:47,500
and I think that there's a,

689
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:52,470
I think as you're growing older you
run into like a database of people,

690
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:53,161
you know,

691
00:18:53,161 --> 00:18:53,611
you run it,

692
00:18:53,611 --> 00:18:58,611
you have like a whole gamut
of wide spectrum and along
that way you kind of get

693
00:18:59,821 --> 00:19:00,050
to,

694
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:02,100
you learn lessons from
the negative ones too.

695
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:05,330
You learn like how never to talk
to other people because you,

696
00:19:05,331 --> 00:19:08,430
you talked to someone talks to you
in a way that like affects you.

697
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,490
I can remember it like negative things
that people said to me when I was a

698
00:19:11,491 --> 00:19:16,020
little kid that stuck with me that I
remember thinking I'll never talked to a

699
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:16,920
little kid like this.

700
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:19,060
I'll never say that kind
of shit to a little kid.

701
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:19,881
Yeah.

702
00:19:19,881 --> 00:19:20,900
And even as an adult,

703
00:19:20,901 --> 00:19:21,680
I remember I was,

704
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,150
I was in college and my friend,

705
00:19:23,151 --> 00:19:27,110
I wanted to be an actress so bad and my
friends that me down this guy and he was

706
00:19:27,111 --> 00:19:27,320
like,

707
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,071
I have to talk to you.

708
00:19:28,071 --> 00:19:28,551
And I was like,

709
00:19:28,551 --> 00:19:28,761
yeah,

710
00:19:28,761 --> 00:19:30,470
this happened to me a
couple times with men.

711
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:31,573
He was like,

712
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:35,180
I just don't think you're going
to be as successful as you want.

713
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:37,070
And I think you need to think about that.

714
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:39,290
A guy sent out to the guy you were dating.

715
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:39,440
He,

716
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:39,950
no,

717
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:43,080
just a friend and then somewhat
another guy dating's a bit.

718
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:43,880
So I was like,

719
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:47,180
I would never tell someone that I
would never sit someone down and say,

720
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,550
I'm afraid of your dreams
aren't going to happen.

721
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,860
Can you imagine saying that to someone?

722
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:52,351
No,

723
00:19:52,351 --> 00:19:52,801
I couldn't.

724
00:19:52,801 --> 00:19:55,590
But I can imagine why a
guy would say that to you.

725
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:59,880
And the reason why probably is like
you're very independent and strong.

726
00:19:59,881 --> 00:20:01,110
Like you're very smart.

727
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:04,110
And I think that's
intimidating to a lot of guys.

728
00:20:04,111 --> 00:20:06,120
A lot of guys need a girl that needs them.

729
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:11,570
And if a guy is around a girl and the
girl seems like she could be fine without

730
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:12,180
you,

731
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:12,541
like,

732
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:12,901
you know,

733
00:20:12,901 --> 00:20:14,040
like there's a little too much,

734
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,660
too much power in this one.

735
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,441
I must,

736
00:20:16,441 --> 00:20:17,274
I'm a SAP it.

737
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:17,551
Oh,

738
00:20:17,551 --> 00:20:18,300
interesting.

739
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:18,451
Yeah.

740
00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:20,850
I think I even think of that men do that.

741
00:20:20,851 --> 00:20:21,684
Other men too,

742
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:22,890
men do that to other men,

743
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:23,730
you know?

744
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:24,563
Uh,

745
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,453
you know,

746
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,730
in the open mic days,

747
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:28,350
I remember there was a lot of that,

748
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:31,890
there was a lot of guys telling other
guys they weren't gonna make it or tell

749
00:20:31,891 --> 00:20:32,190
him.

750
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:34,350
And like David Taylor,

751
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:35,251
oh,

752
00:20:35,251 --> 00:20:36,084
he's about,

753
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:37,740
he was always battle with that,

754
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:38,843
but it's just an,

755
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:39,630
you know,

756
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:40,260
it was Dave.

757
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:40,891
I think he's just,

758
00:20:40,891 --> 00:20:41,220
you know,

759
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,570
he's shown work through his own stuff leg.

760
00:20:43,571 --> 00:20:44,430
A lot of folks are,

761
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,660
you know,

762
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:50,470
it's like working through your own stuff
at the expense of other people is a

763
00:20:50,471 --> 00:20:51,740
sport that's,

764
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,830
I can see if I could diminish this person,

765
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,630
but men do it a lot to women.

766
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,790
I think some women do it to men too.

767
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:58,451
You know,

768
00:20:58,451 --> 00:21:01,990
some women will try to convince a
guy to get a regular job because,

769
00:21:01,991 --> 00:21:02,560
uh,

770
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,393
it was never going to,

771
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,330
it's never going to make,

772
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:04,631
you know,

773
00:21:04,631 --> 00:21:05,080
look,

774
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,040
I'm not going to make it.

775
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:06,911
Well,

776
00:21:06,911 --> 00:21:07,091
that's,

777
00:21:07,091 --> 00:21:07,721
you see,

778
00:21:07,721 --> 00:21:08,051
you're,

779
00:21:08,051 --> 00:21:08,950
you're independent.

780
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:10,930
You raised your sister,

781
00:21:10,931 --> 00:21:11,764
your brothers,

782
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:12,131
you know,

783
00:21:12,131 --> 00:21:12,471
you,

784
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:13,630
you had to do your own thing.

785
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:15,700
Childhood was a drag and you're like,

786
00:21:15,701 --> 00:21:17,320
get me the fuck away
from all these people.

787
00:21:17,321 --> 00:21:18,670
I got this right.

788
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:19,533
That's your attitude,

789
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:20,470
you know,

790
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:20,741
and you're like,

791
00:21:20,741 --> 00:21:21,940
I'm going to be a fucking comedian.

792
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:22,810
And now they're like,

793
00:21:22,811 --> 00:21:23,320
listen,

794
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,070
Natasha,

795
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:27,400
I think you need to come to grips with
reality that that might not happen.

796
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,353
Okay.

797
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:29,891
I take it,

798
00:21:29,891 --> 00:21:33,670
I took an acting class once
and it was really gross.

799
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,740
I had to take it because a,

800
00:21:35,741 --> 00:21:36,760
I got a development deal.

801
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:40,390
I had this crazy development deal with
Disney and they were writing a Sitcom and

802
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,430
I had zero acting experience.

803
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:43,443
I was 25.

804
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:44,080
Right.

805
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:44,471
So,

806
00:21:44,471 --> 00:21:44,920
uh,

807
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,710
it's like all of a sudden I have this
whole fucking thing handed to me.

808
00:21:47,711 --> 00:21:49,240
It's just completely ridiculous.

809
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:53,720
And they give me this acting
coach and this lady's so naked,

810
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:58,090
she's so negative and
she's fat and she's tired.

811
00:21:58,091 --> 00:21:58,900
And,

812
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,930
and one of the things she
asked is if the show goes,

813
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:02,440
she,

814
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:06,040
she wants me to have
them pitch her as my mom.

815
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,010
She's like,

816
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:09,730
if this show,

817
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:10,870
if this show goes,

818
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:14,230
I want you to pitch them
that I could play your mom.

819
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:15,460
And I remember being like,

820
00:22:15,461 --> 00:22:16,294
what?

821
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,080
Like she was terrible.

822
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:17,913
Like we would,

823
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,200
we would have read and when
we'd read she'd be like,

824
00:22:20,201 --> 00:22:21,070
so fake,

825
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:21,701
you know,

826
00:22:21,701 --> 00:22:22,750
like when you don't like,

827
00:22:22,751 --> 00:22:25,120
you learn as a comic that if you're,

828
00:22:25,121 --> 00:22:27,250
if you're saying something that
someone doesn't connect with,

829
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,031
the shit does,

830
00:22:28,031 --> 00:22:28,990
it doesn't work.

831
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:29,680
You know?

832
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,030
So like when you're doing,

833
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,370
when you're reading something like you,

834
00:22:33,371 --> 00:22:36,820
you've got to try to make that thing
as real as this conversation is.

835
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:38,980
And she was not like that.

836
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:39,843
She was like,

837
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,193
Natasha,

838
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,640
I'm telling you right now,

839
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,170
this is not going to work.

840
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:44,750
Like,

841
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:44,920
you know,

842
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,410
it was just like so corny and clunky.

843
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:50,920
And for the Disney channel it was free.

844
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,870
He was actually for Fox.

845
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:53,800
It was for Fox,

846
00:22:53,801 --> 00:22:54,161
but it was,

847
00:22:54,161 --> 00:22:56,440
Disney had the development deal.

848
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:57,130
So,

849
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:57,310
um,

850
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:59,320
she one day she said to me,

851
00:22:59,321 --> 00:23:00,250
she like during the,

852
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:00,371
uh,

853
00:23:00,371 --> 00:23:01,204
she goes,

854
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:04,840
I'm worried that you're going to go
out there and you're going to fail.

855
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:06,760
That's what she said to me.

856
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:07,301
And I go,

857
00:23:07,301 --> 00:23:08,400
why are you worried about that?

858
00:23:08,401 --> 00:23:09,520
Cause I'm not worried about that.

859
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:09,971
I go,

860
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:11,170
I'm not worried about that at all.

861
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,070
Let's just do this.

862
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:12,820
And like,

863
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,800
I like turned around the class,

864
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:15,221
you know,

865
00:23:15,221 --> 00:23:15,521
I go,

866
00:23:15,521 --> 00:23:16,354
look,

867
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,280
I'm not worried about this at all,

868
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,670
that much strength at 25 to say
that I would've started balling.

869
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:24,130
I came from a different world.

870
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:25,480
I came from the world of fighting,

871
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:25,931
you know,

872
00:23:25,931 --> 00:23:29,020
so I had been competing in martial
arts tournaments my whole life.

873
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:31,450
So like this lady telling me
that I'm gonna fail at what?

874
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:33,060
Acting what?

875
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,900
I'm going to freak out
when they say action,

876
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,711
the fuck Outta here,

877
00:23:35,711 --> 00:23:36,544
bitch.

878
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:38,230
The whole thing was so ridiculous to me,

879
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,740
but it was so obvious to me that she was
trying to intimidate me and it was that

880
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:43,210
she didn't like that it was too confident.

881
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,620
She didn't like that I was cocky.

882
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:45,980
It was bothering her.

883
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:46,580
It's like,

884
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,440
I'm worried you're going to go
out there and you're gonna fail.

885
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:49,160
I'm like,

886
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:49,993
acting

887
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,570
this shit that I'm already better at you.

888
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:55,190
Better at than you.

889
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:58,010
It's ridiculous and I'm not even good
at it and you're fucking teaching it.

890
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:02,360
I'm terrible at it and I'm better
than you and you teach it so fuck off.

891
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:03,283
But it was,

892
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,230
it was a clear feeling that
she was trying to diminish me.

893
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:07,041
And I remember thinking,

894
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:07,940
Oh this is scary.

895
00:24:07,941 --> 00:24:10,850
I was scared if I had kids
that that was going to happen.

896
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,391
The champ,

897
00:24:11,391 --> 00:24:11,631
what you,

898
00:24:11,631 --> 00:24:16,631
it's like you would maybe be scared
because you didn't have a lot of time with

899
00:24:16,911 --> 00:24:17,541
your parents.

900
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:17,781
We,

901
00:24:17,781 --> 00:24:20,180
they were encouraging you and helping you.

902
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:22,310
I'm around my kids all the time.

903
00:24:22,311 --> 00:24:22,950
You are.

904
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:23,390
Yeah.

905
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:26,060
I spend like I spend full days,

906
00:24:26,061 --> 00:24:26,930
like every Tuesdays,

907
00:24:26,931 --> 00:24:28,430
daddy daughter day we do.

908
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:29,410
Yeah.

909
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:30,243
Yeah,

910
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:30,770
yeah.

911
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:32,930
Dunkin said ones and I
thought this was so smart.

912
00:24:32,931 --> 00:24:36,410
He said the best Karma you can have
as being born into a good family.

913
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,490
Yeah.

914
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:40,490
And I thought that was like really
interesting cause it's like that is just a

915
00:24:40,491 --> 00:24:41,091
lucky,

916
00:24:41,091 --> 00:24:44,120
lucky person because you're
going to get all of the,

917
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:44,871
you know,

918
00:24:44,871 --> 00:24:48,200
your kids are like my friend
Ricky and I figured this out.

919
00:24:48,201 --> 00:24:50,930
It's like your kids are like
a second generation success.

920
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,680
Like you did it yourself and
now your kids are benefiting.

921
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:55,230
You know,

922
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:57,290
they're at the level that
like Lena Dunham's going to,

923
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:57,760
you know,

924
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,920
like her parents were successful
and got themselves out of it.

925
00:25:00,921 --> 00:25:01,611
And you know,

926
00:25:01,611 --> 00:25:05,510
like you see these people who like you're
the first generation of someone who,

927
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:08,750
who climbed out of the mud or
you're like the fourth generation,

928
00:25:08,751 --> 00:25:11,780
like your grandma was working for
civil rights and then your parents were

929
00:25:11,781 --> 00:25:14,390
successful artists and
then now you're an artist.

930
00:25:14,391 --> 00:25:18,170
It's like it does a generation thing where
I think you'd benefit and you can get

931
00:25:18,171 --> 00:25:19,160
success earlier.

932
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:19,571
Yeah,

933
00:25:19,571 --> 00:25:20,021
maybe.

934
00:25:20,021 --> 00:25:23,890
But I think it's also difficult
because they didn't earn it themselves.

935
00:25:23,891 --> 00:25:27,670
Like I have a friend and his parents were
very successful and he worked for his

936
00:25:27,671 --> 00:25:28,900
family business for awhile,

937
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:29,840
but he,

938
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,200
it always bothered him even
though he was doing well.

939
00:25:32,201 --> 00:25:32,531
He's like,

940
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:33,790
I didn't earn any of this.

941
00:25:33,791 --> 00:25:35,620
Like this is kind of freaks me out.

942
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:36,350
Yeah.

943
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:36,860
But look it,

944
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:37,693
I mean,

945
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:41,570
there's so many famous people who have
kids who are losers and it does take

946
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,080
something,

947
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:42,510
I mean,

948
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:44,160
well I think with them it's neglect,

949
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:48,360
but they just might not have the drive
or the ambition or a little bit of that.

950
00:25:48,361 --> 00:25:49,230
But it's a lot of like,

951
00:25:49,231 --> 00:25:50,040
if it's,

952
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,750
a lot of it happens with actors.

953
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:52,260
Yeah.

954
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:55,020
Because they're working and
they go away from more to the,

955
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:55,980
yes,

956
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:56,341
yes,

957
00:25:56,341 --> 00:25:57,174
yes.

958
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:58,020
I think,

959
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:03,020
I think there's a lot of actors that are
like really fucking self obsessed and n

960
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:06,060
singers and it's celebrities
where they're just,

961
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:06,721
you know,

962
00:26:06,721 --> 00:26:09,300
if you're going to be fucking
share or something like that,

963
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:09,430
like,

964
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:09,960
yeah,

965
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,670
good luck taking vacations.

966
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,440
Good luck having fun with your kids.

967
00:26:13,441 --> 00:26:14,191
Like you're,

968
00:26:14,191 --> 00:26:14,820
you're,

969
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:17,430
you're the CEO of an empire that is,

970
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:17,940
you know,

971
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:18,960
whoever the fuck you are,

972
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:19,680
you know,

973
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,510
fill in the blank with whatever superstar.

974
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,870
That dive requires everything you have.

975
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:25,490
No,

976
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:28,650
I knew someone who knew like Barbara
Streisand son and he wouldn't,

977
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:29,191
you know,

978
00:26:29,191 --> 00:26:29,521
he had,

979
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:29,911
he had hit,

980
00:26:29,911 --> 00:26:32,130
he'd have a play and she
would wouldn't show up.

981
00:26:32,131 --> 00:26:33,120
And you know,

982
00:26:33,121 --> 00:26:33,954
it's like how,

983
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:37,230
but I'm sure you can
make it happen somehow.

984
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:37,290
All

985
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:37,501
right.

986
00:26:37,501 --> 00:26:37,830
Yeah.

987
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:40,800
I mean it's requires a
lot of communication.

988
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:41,873
You know,

989
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:43,200
I have a stepdaughter,

990
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,033
the 18.

991
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:44,671
Really?

992
00:26:44,671 --> 00:26:45,150
Yeah.

993
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:47,040
I've been with her for
since she was little.

994
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:47,821
That's so funny.

995
00:26:47,821 --> 00:26:48,810
You have all daughters.

996
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:53,340
It is funny because
you're so like masculine,

997
00:26:53,341 --> 00:26:54,174
you know,

998
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:55,093
that happens a lot.

999
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,250
A lot of fighters have um,

1000
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:57,500
uh,

1001
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,100
daughters.

1002
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:58,611
It's like really,

1003
00:26:58,611 --> 00:26:59,444
really common.

1004
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,090
I liked that you consider
yourself a fighter.

1005
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:03,703
My dog.

1006
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:06,020
Do you feel like you're a
comedian more than a fighter?

1007
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:06,961
No.

1008
00:27:06,961 --> 00:27:08,370
I'm a human being I think,

1009
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:09,840
but I do a lot of different stuff,

1010
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,330
but I'm just saying a lot of UFC fighters,

1011
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:13,350
a lot of them have daughters.

1012
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:14,020
Like it's like,

1013
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,510
like they joke around about it,

1014
00:27:15,511 --> 00:27:15,670
let it,

1015
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:20,050
it's like a fighter's curse that a lot
of them have daughters for some reason.

1016
00:27:20,051 --> 00:27:20,884
Your blessing,

1017
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,830
they don't go into that bloody fields.

1018
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:25,373
Wretched.

1019
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,870
I think it's a balance thing.

1020
00:27:27,871 --> 00:27:31,050
I think the universe gives
you like this gift of,

1021
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:36,420
of a different type of human being neurons
and also the different perspective.

1022
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:38,130
Raising daughters to me has been very,

1023
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,230
very educational because a,

1024
00:27:40,231 --> 00:27:43,440
raising them and being
around them all the time,

1025
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:44,010
you kind of,

1026
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:47,460
you understand first of all that you're
dealing with a completely different kind

1027
00:27:47,461 --> 00:27:48,294
of human being.

1028
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,110
Whereas,

1029
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:49,351
yeah,

1030
00:27:49,351 --> 00:27:50,640
we were so when I was a kid,

1031
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:52,500
daughters or girls rather,

1032
00:27:52,501 --> 00:27:53,340
we're always like,

1033
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:54,840
it was us and them.

1034
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:56,280
It was like boys.

1035
00:27:56,281 --> 00:27:58,290
And then there was girls and
now I don't know what the fuck,

1036
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,071
what are they wearing?

1037
00:27:59,071 --> 00:28:00,990
Makeup and shoes and weird shit.

1038
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:02,520
I fucking gets it.

1039
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:02,821
You know,

1040
00:28:02,821 --> 00:28:03,654
you didn't get it.

1041
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:04,171
I mean,

1042
00:28:04,171 --> 00:28:06,360
I had a sister but I didn't,

1043
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:10,230
I didn't understand them
the way I understand them.

1044
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,210
Like having a wife and having daughters,

1045
00:28:12,211 --> 00:28:13,350
like I kind of,

1046
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:18,410
I'm way a way more tuned in to that style
of human being than I was when I was a

1047
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:21,090
young man.

1048
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,260
That style of humor.

1049
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,101
Well that's what it is.

1050
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:24,720
It's a different kind of human being.

1051
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:25,920
You know,

1052
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,890
you're a different kind
of human being than me.

1053
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:29,943
You know,

1054
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,320
I don't like make 'em ups.

1055
00:28:31,321 --> 00:28:35,750
I don't like blood might come up unique

1056
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,780
in your own feminine and an eight,

1057
00:28:37,781 --> 00:28:40,300
but a woman is a different kind of human.

1058
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:43,640
It takes a long time to sort of figure
out the ins and the outs of that.

1059
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:48,530
I think it's probably really difficult
for you to understand what goes on in a

1060
00:28:48,531 --> 00:28:49,430
man's mind.

1061
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:52,520
Just like it's really difficult for
a man to understand what goes on in a

1062
00:28:52,521 --> 00:28:53,354
woman's mind.

1063
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:55,700
And when you see it from
the time they're infants,

1064
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:57,530
when the time when they
were little babies,

1065
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:00,770
it gives you more insight than
growing up with your sister.

1066
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:01,191
You know,

1067
00:29:01,191 --> 00:29:01,971
growing up with my sister,

1068
00:29:01,971 --> 00:29:03,140
I of I love my sister,

1069
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:05,600
she's awesome and I love her to death,

1070
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:07,100
but she's my sister,

1071
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:07,640
you know,

1072
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,840
she's not like a baby that I saw grow.

1073
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:14,960
And so like raising daughters has
been insanely educational for me.

1074
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:16,360
You know,

1075
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,140
and you care about them so much.

1076
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:19,190
It's a weird thing.

1077
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:21,830
You care about them that
you don't care about them.

1078
00:29:21,831 --> 00:29:22,700
Like you love them,

1079
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:26,390
you care about them like you love
them more than you love your own life.

1080
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:27,500
It's real weird.

1081
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:29,050
Love your two hours,

1082
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:30,890
but if I did,

1083
00:29:30,891 --> 00:29:31,670
yes.

1084
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:31,940
Yeah.

1085
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:32,180
My,

1086
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,013
my friend Eddie,

1087
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:36,860
he had rabbits and I'm
different than it to Allah.

1088
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:37,760
Well,

1089
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,450
yes,

1090
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:39,283
I guess,

1091
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,290
but he had cats and he
loves these animals.

1092
00:29:41,291 --> 00:29:42,280
He loves the shit out of him.

1093
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:44,350
And his wife was pregnant and I said,

1094
00:29:44,351 --> 00:29:45,184
listen dude,

1095
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,110
once your baby's born,

1096
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:50,410
you're going to want to kill
those fucking cats transfer.

1097
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,221
We just shoot.

1098
00:29:51,221 --> 00:29:51,671
He's like,

1099
00:29:51,671 --> 00:29:52,361
no way,

1100
00:29:52,361 --> 00:29:52,661
man.

1101
00:29:52,661 --> 00:29:53,051
No Way.

1102
00:29:53,051 --> 00:29:53,861
I'm telling you,

1103
00:29:53,861 --> 00:29:54,521
I'm telling you,

1104
00:29:54,521 --> 00:29:56,650
you're not going to give a fuck
about those animals anymore.

1105
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:58,060
You're going to love your kid so much.

1106
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:01,300
You're going to laugh at the idea
of how much you love these animals.

1107
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:01,721
I mean,

1108
00:30:01,721 --> 00:30:03,190
you're not really gonna kill the animals,

1109
00:30:03,191 --> 00:30:04,240
but is that true?

1110
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:04,930
Yes.

1111
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:05,171
Yeah.

1112
00:30:05,171 --> 00:30:05,720
You're the,

1113
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,800
the dose shift is substantial.

1114
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,510
The level of love.

1115
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:13,960
Like you could leave your kid
in the Kennel for a weekend,

1116
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:14,520
right?

1117
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:14,950
Yeah.

1118
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:15,131
I mean,

1119
00:30:15,131 --> 00:30:15,640
your dog,

1120
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,290
you could leave your dog
in a Kennel for a weekend,

1121
00:30:17,291 --> 00:30:18,124
go somewhere.

1122
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,001
You can't leave.

1123
00:30:19,001 --> 00:30:20,220
Your kid cannot.

1124
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,790
You can't leave your kid for an hour.

1125
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:22,781
You freak out.

1126
00:30:22,781 --> 00:30:23,441
It's weird.

1127
00:30:23,441 --> 00:30:24,430
It's a weird feeling,

1128
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:25,540
consistent thing.

1129
00:30:25,541 --> 00:30:26,321
They give back,

1130
00:30:26,321 --> 00:30:26,621
you know,

1131
00:30:26,621 --> 00:30:27,460
like they're cute,

1132
00:30:27,461 --> 00:30:28,211
they lay with you,

1133
00:30:28,211 --> 00:30:29,470
but they don't really talk.

1134
00:30:29,471 --> 00:30:30,310
They don't grow.

1135
00:30:30,311 --> 00:30:33,850
It's just kind of like they just do their
thing for 12 years and then they die.

1136
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,690
They don't have questions like,

1137
00:30:35,691 --> 00:30:35,990
uh,

1138
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:36,823
my three year old,

1139
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:37,850
well she's a,

1140
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:38,451
she's five now,

1141
00:30:38,451 --> 00:30:39,320
but when she turned three,

1142
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:41,720
she started crying and I go,

1143
00:30:41,721 --> 00:30:42,530
what's manner?

1144
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:43,240
She goes,

1145
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,610
I'm still litter.

1146
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,151
And I go,

1147
00:30:47,151 --> 00:30:49,630
did you think that when you turn
three that you would be bigger?

1148
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:50,031
She goes,

1149
00:30:50,031 --> 00:30:50,864
yeah,

1150
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:51,621
I go,

1151
00:30:51,621 --> 00:30:51,951
no,

1152
00:30:51,951 --> 00:30:56,000
it's a gradual cause she's the
youngest is going to get tall talk.

1153
00:30:56,001 --> 00:30:57,320
Like all of a sudden she'd be bigger.

1154
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,700
Oh,

1155
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,400
I mean it's like that kind of
thinking like mind expanding too.

1156
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:03,010
Yeah.

1157
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:03,950
It's fascinating.

1158
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,630
It's unbelievably fascinating.

1159
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:05,901
It's,

1160
00:31:05,901 --> 00:31:06,734
it's like,

1161
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:07,620
you know,

1162
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:08,510
I really like,

1163
00:31:08,511 --> 00:31:09,470
it's not a chore.

1164
00:31:09,471 --> 00:31:11,600
Like if I had a babysit someone's kid,

1165
00:31:11,601 --> 00:31:12,710
it would be kind of a chore.

1166
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,260
But hanging out with my
kids is not a chore at all.

1167
00:31:15,261 --> 00:31:16,460
It's like I love it.

1168
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,480
It's really fun.

1169
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:21,190
Like it doesn't seem like something like
a man would love to do is hang out with

1170
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:22,043
little girls.

1171
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:23,101
But I love how,

1172
00:31:23,101 --> 00:31:23,301
you know,

1173
00:31:23,301 --> 00:31:26,360
we play all kinds of silly
games and we played kitchen,

1174
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:29,750
they have like little fake kitchen shit
and they make me fake food and pretend

1175
00:31:29,751 --> 00:31:30,201
to eat it.

1176
00:31:30,201 --> 00:31:31,910
And we joke around about stuff.

1177
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:35,210
It's very a very different
way of living life.

1178
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,200
You discipline them.

1179
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:39,560
I don't discipline the
like I don't beat them.

1180
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:40,453
Is that what you're asking me,

1181
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:40,790
Bill?

1182
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:42,050
I'm just wondering like how,

1183
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:42,261
yeah,

1184
00:31:42,261 --> 00:31:45,010
like how do they get dive and when you
have to explain to them when they're

1185
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:45,853
doing the wrong.

1186
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:46,610
Yeah.

1187
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:47,390
Well that's,

1188
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:48,950
I mean that's sort of educational.

1189
00:31:48,951 --> 00:31:49,161
I mean,

1190
00:31:49,161 --> 00:31:50,000
when they do something wrong,

1191
00:31:50,001 --> 00:31:51,770
you have to explain
that they can't do that.

1192
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:56,900
But you have to do it in one of the things
that I always do is I always let them

1193
00:31:56,901 --> 00:31:57,734
know that any,

1194
00:31:57,770 --> 00:31:59,000
any fuck up that they've had,

1195
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,380
any mistake they make,

1196
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,273
I've already done it.

1197
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,150
I've already fucked up.

1198
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,530
I fucked up way more than you.

1199
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,110
Like if there's a fuck no,

1200
00:32:06,111 --> 00:32:06,801
I try not to.

1201
00:32:06,801 --> 00:32:07,970
I swear every now and then,

1202
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,440
but most of the time now.

1203
00:32:09,441 --> 00:32:10,274
One time,

1204
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:11,271
one time when my,

1205
00:32:11,271 --> 00:32:11,570
uh,

1206
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:12,440
my daughter was three,

1207
00:32:12,441 --> 00:32:13,040
two,

1208
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,000
I've been taking them skins.

1209
00:32:14,001 --> 00:32:14,834
It's a really little,

1210
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:20,000
when she was three we were at the ski
place and she forgot to pack her helmet

1211
00:32:20,001 --> 00:32:21,850
and her suitcase and a,

1212
00:32:21,851 --> 00:32:22,130
you know,

1213
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:22,341
we're,

1214
00:32:22,341 --> 00:32:23,360
we're getting ready to leave.

1215
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:23,930
And uh,

1216
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:24,260
I go,

1217
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:24,471
oh,

1218
00:32:24,471 --> 00:32:26,570
we didn't pack her helmet
and she looks at her luggage.

1219
00:32:26,571 --> 00:32:27,404
She goes,

1220
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,273
shit,

1221
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:31,630
everyone laughs.

1222
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:32,370
No,

1223
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:33,770
my wife turned and looked at me like,

1224
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:35,030
oh no,

1225
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,350
like don't say anything.

1226
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,900
Cause if you laughed and they think it's

1227
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,860
right and then we'll keep doing it.

1228
00:32:40,861 --> 00:32:41,101
That's it.

1229
00:32:41,101 --> 00:32:42,930
Sarah Silverman said in her book that she,

1230
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:47,960
she would get so much positive energy
when she would swear that does created a

1231
00:32:48,121 --> 00:32:48,570
comedian.

1232
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:51,150
But see that created a
comedian in a lot of ways.

1233
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:51,560
Yeah.

1234
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:51,830
I mean,

1235
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:53,240
so it's interesting
what's going to happen.

1236
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,031
I mean I'm,

1237
00:32:54,031 --> 00:32:55,920
I'm sure you're doing an
amazing job with your kids,

1238
00:32:55,921 --> 00:32:57,970
but from what I've seen with my friends,

1239
00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:02,990
there's so much positive encouragement
happening in this generation where it's

1240
00:33:03,211 --> 00:33:05,430
like I was talking to my friends kids
and I was talking about New York.

1241
00:33:05,431 --> 00:33:05,671
She goes,

1242
00:33:05,671 --> 00:33:06,480
can you not,

1243
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,100
can you not say anything
negative about New York?

1244
00:33:08,101 --> 00:33:12,240
I really want them to think of it as
a vibrant city and like every bar,

1245
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:16,140
every single thing and like I was like
swimming with her and she's like make

1246
00:33:16,141 --> 00:33:17,640
sure she does the breast
stroke the right way.

1247
00:33:17,641 --> 00:33:19,290
I don't want her learning
the wrong way and it's just,

1248
00:33:19,291 --> 00:33:21,270
I mean this might be an extreme example,

1249
00:33:21,271 --> 00:33:23,790
but at the same time I think like wow,

1250
00:33:23,791 --> 00:33:24,451
like this is just,

1251
00:33:24,451 --> 00:33:28,770
and then those kids are going to
give birth to Cyborg or those people.

1252
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:29,813
What is your kit?

1253
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:33,000
What is your three year old or five
year olds child going to be like,

1254
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:33,630
yeah,

1255
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:35,640
they're going to have
implants in their brains.

1256
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,160
Well I think that's
going to happen already.

1257
00:33:37,161 --> 00:33:39,230
Have you seen that implant
that they came out with?

1258
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,370
They won't even know life though.

1259
00:33:40,371 --> 00:33:42,050
Like how we know that they won't,

1260
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:45,570
I mean even kids that are teenagers today
don't know life the way we know live

1261
00:33:45,571 --> 00:33:46,910
because we grew up without the internet.

1262
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:49,300
I mean I used to check my
internet at the video store,

1263
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,280
my email at the video
store when I moved to La.

1264
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:53,680
I like didn't want to get a cell phone.

1265
00:33:53,681 --> 00:33:55,120
I'd go to the video store.

1266
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,130
How come you didn't want to,

1267
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,550
well it was like 12 years ago.

1268
00:33:57,730 --> 00:33:59,710
Cause I've always been
kind of anti technology.

1269
00:33:59,711 --> 00:34:01,330
I've never wanted TVs around me.

1270
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:02,050
Oops.

1271
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:02,830
I'll make them up.

1272
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:03,251
I like,

1273
00:34:03,251 --> 00:34:03,791
I mean I'm,

1274
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:04,091
you know,

1275
00:34:04,091 --> 00:34:04,201
I,

1276
00:34:04,201 --> 00:34:04,751
I like,

1277
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:05,190
uh,

1278
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:07,910
I like re I used to like reading more and

1279
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:11,110
they have this new lens that they're
going to insert into people's eyes.

1280
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:13,590
It'll give you three
times the vision of 2020.

1281
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:14,820
It's insane.

1282
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:15,930
What does that seem at gym?

1283
00:34:15,931 --> 00:34:16,890
You can't see far away.

1284
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:20,000
You're going to be able
to see in like way clear,

1285
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:20,850
way further,

1286
00:34:20,851 --> 00:34:23,940
way more detail than any human being can,

1287
00:34:23,941 --> 00:34:24,150
right?

1288
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:24,360
Way.

1289
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:24,930
But what does that

1290
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:25,800
do by the way?

1291
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:27,180
Cause everyone's like HD.

1292
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:27,901
It's so great.

1293
00:34:27,901 --> 00:34:29,190
And it makes women look like shit

1294
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,501
or men.

1295
00:34:31,501 --> 00:34:31,771
But like,

1296
00:34:31,771 --> 00:34:32,910
what's it gonna do for our skin?

1297
00:34:32,911 --> 00:34:34,730
Is that going to make
us look less attractive?

1298
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:35,690
That's what I wonder.

1299
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:36,550
Yes.

1300
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:36,770
We'll,

1301
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:37,060
we'll,

1302
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,220
we'll just tell him that.

1303
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:38,630
We'll,

1304
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:41,180
we'll only meet and then I'll
look at my husband's pores.

1305
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:44,390
Are you scared of pores?

1306
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:44,811
No,

1307
00:34:44,811 --> 00:34:45,710
but I just mean like,

1308
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:46,071
you know what,

1309
00:34:46,071 --> 00:34:46,191
they're,

1310
00:34:46,191 --> 00:34:46,971
you know what there's going to be,

1311
00:34:46,971 --> 00:34:51,230
I bet like little cartoon
mascot or something that we
could put on our faces so

1312
00:34:51,231 --> 00:34:52,490
that you can't even age.

1313
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:53,080
Right?

1314
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,100
Like instead of,

1315
00:34:54,101 --> 00:34:54,630
uh,

1316
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:55,660
instead of like makeup,

1317
00:34:55,661 --> 00:34:56,530
you'll just wear a mask.

1318
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:01,410
Maybe while there was another study
recently that they've found a way to like

1319
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:03,520
reverse aging in certain cells.

1320
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:04,421
This is the,

1321
00:35:04,421 --> 00:35:05,110
uh,

1322
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:08,140
optometrist claims to invent
Lens three times better than 20,

1323
00:35:08,141 --> 00:35:08,974
20 vision.

1324
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:11,380
I wonder what it looks
like in that though.

1325
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:12,400
Yeah.

1326
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:17,400
Who the fuck knows devices called a
[inaudible] met ticks argument ex bionic

1327
00:35:18,371 --> 00:35:18,821
Lens.

1328
00:35:18,821 --> 00:35:21,040
He claimed it allows you to
see three times better than 20,

1329
00:35:21,041 --> 00:35:24,520
20 vision without wearing
contacts or glasses at all.

1330
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:28,870
So they think that like macular
degeneration is a thing of the past.

1331
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:30,310
In about 10 seconds,

1332
00:35:30,311 --> 00:35:34,480
a lens unravels over your eye and
your site is immediately corrected.

1333
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:35,070
Well,

1334
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:36,970
I understand that if
you've got bad eyesight,

1335
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:38,040
just putting that

1336
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:41,460
in to like try to be a super,

1337
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:42,600
super hero.

1338
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:45,920
This is what it's going to be implanted
in your honor during an eight minute

1339
00:35:45,921 --> 00:35:49,250
painless procedure similar
to Cadillac cataract surgery.

1340
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:54,210
It's folded like a Taco and placed in the
eye using a syringe filled with céline

1341
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,093
solution.

1342
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:55,780
Wow.

1343
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:57,160
But here's the thing
that's going to happen.

1344
00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:01,930
There's going to be an anti technology
movement and then there's going to be the

1345
00:36:01,931 --> 00:36:05,200
people who want to do this and then was
going to be the people who are like,

1346
00:36:05,201 --> 00:36:05,351
like,

1347
00:36:05,351 --> 00:36:05,711
already,

1348
00:36:05,711 --> 00:36:06,670
I see it in New York.

1349
00:36:06,671 --> 00:36:09,790
They're like advertising at
these like cool hipster bars.

1350
00:36:09,791 --> 00:36:11,230
Like no TV in here.

1351
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:12,211
You know,

1352
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:16,840
like it's like people want to go to these
havens of like just socializing with

1353
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:17,551
people and,

1354
00:36:17,551 --> 00:36:18,030
and,

1355
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:20,050
and eating farm to table and,

1356
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:20,801
and you know,

1357
00:36:20,801 --> 00:36:23,920
like there's all these like farm movements
and I think there's going to be this

1358
00:36:23,921 --> 00:36:24,370
kind of,

1359
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:24,551
uh,

1360
00:36:24,551 --> 00:36:29,020
hopefully like a new sixties that's like
another hippie movement against all of

1361
00:36:29,021 --> 00:36:31,060
this technology or a lot of that,

1362
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,350
I'm going to start it,

1363
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,230
you'll be a part of it,

1364
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:39,500
but there's a lot of bars and restaurants
are into like metal and wood and it

1365
00:36:40,711 --> 00:36:43,050
makes it look like real
rustic click all the like,

1366
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:45,120
like the tables like this table,

1367
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:45,781
you know,

1368
00:36:45,781 --> 00:36:46,920
like brick walls,

1369
00:36:46,921 --> 00:36:51,630
like people into like real things as
opposed to like plastics and you know,

1370
00:36:51,631 --> 00:36:51,831
and,

1371
00:36:51,831 --> 00:36:53,190
and shiny like,

1372
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:57,210
like different colored lights like
the inside of a virgin mobile plain,

1373
00:36:57,211 --> 00:36:57,900
you know?

1374
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:58,291
Yeah.

1375
00:36:58,291 --> 00:36:58,860
You know what I mean?

1376
00:36:58,860 --> 00:36:59,590
It's like that,

1377
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:01,510
but some people are super into that way.

1378
00:37:01,511 --> 00:37:03,640
Like people just want it like they want,

1379
00:37:03,641 --> 00:37:06,310
they cannot wait like someone
like red band or like someone,

1380
00:37:06,311 --> 00:37:06,551
you know,

1381
00:37:06,551 --> 00:37:07,840
it's like he probably like,

1382
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:12,070
I feel like every technology he's like
absorbing and trying and I mean there's

1383
00:37:12,071 --> 00:37:14,560
like that extreme kind of person,

1384
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,790
but looking at him it's a mess.

1385
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:17,710
That's why I picked him.

1386
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:19,271
No,

1387
00:37:19,271 --> 00:37:20,104
I'm just kidding.

1388
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,400
But he's funny and silly.

1389
00:37:21,401 --> 00:37:21,460
Yeah,

1390
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:21,641
no,

1391
00:37:21,641 --> 00:37:22,474
he's great.

1392
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:26,770
He's at the cutting edge of technology
and there's a lot of people like that.

1393
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:28,150
They get inspired by it,

1394
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:28,720
whereas like,

1395
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,270
well I'm on like that and a
lot of ways I love technology.

1396
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,030
Yeah.

1397
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:33,400
Most people around me are like that.

1398
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,640
I just find human innovation fascinating.

1399
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:38,620
I think the idea of human innovation,

1400
00:37:38,621 --> 00:37:39,850
I just think it's a,

1401
00:37:39,851 --> 00:37:40,330
it's a,

1402
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:42,160
an unstoppable process I think.

1403
00:37:42,161 --> 00:37:44,080
I think unless we get wiped out,

1404
00:37:44,081 --> 00:37:46,330
unless something horrible
happens to the human race,

1405
00:37:46,331 --> 00:37:47,111
it's inevitable.

1406
00:37:47,111 --> 00:37:48,700
We're just going to continue to innovate.

1407
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:49,640
And I,

1408
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:49,961
you know,

1409
00:37:49,961 --> 00:37:50,890
I extrapolated,

1410
00:37:50,891 --> 00:37:52,030
I take it like really far.

1411
00:37:52,031 --> 00:37:52,960
I think about it all the time.

1412
00:37:52,961 --> 00:37:54,940
Like what exactly is happening?

1413
00:37:54,941 --> 00:37:57,760
I think we are giving birth
to a new type of life.

1414
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:58,761
We are.

1415
00:37:58,761 --> 00:37:59,660
But here's the thing,

1416
00:37:59,661 --> 00:38:02,360
I was just reading this really interesting
article in the week and they were

1417
00:38:02,361 --> 00:38:06,950
saying innovation has stopped in the
sense of like they used to be like more

1418
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:10,880
money put towards cancer research
and going to space and now everyone,

1419
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:13,280
the only innovations that are
happening are with the phone.

1420
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,500
It's all about the phone.

1421
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:15,771
It's,

1422
00:38:15,771 --> 00:38:16,160
but it,

1423
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,060
it is in a way like all we
care about is our phones and,

1424
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:22,220
and how fast they're moving and what they
can get us in the gps and what they're

1425
00:38:22,221 --> 00:38:24,380
going to project into our
brains and into our lives.

1426
00:38:24,381 --> 00:38:25,220
And I feel like

1427
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:27,170
it's an intimate attachment for sure.

1428
00:38:27,171 --> 00:38:30,080
But it's absolutely not true
that that's the only innovation.

1429
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,640
Have you seen oculus rift?

1430
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:33,150
It still has to do.

1431
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:33,391
Yes,

1432
00:38:33,391 --> 00:38:33,621
I've had,

1433
00:38:33,621 --> 00:38:34,380
I've tried it.

1434
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:34,960
It's amazing.

1435
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,640
But it still has to do with like,

1436
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:39,100
it's like a video game basically.

1437
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:39,440
Right.

1438
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,690
But that has nothing
to do with your phone.

1439
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:41,741
Well,

1440
00:38:41,741 --> 00:38:42,210
it's,

1441
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:42,880
it's a part,

1442
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,310
it's,

1443
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:44,920
it's part of that realm.

1444
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:47,810
Well that's the realm
of artificial reality.

1445
00:38:47,811 --> 00:38:49,930
Simulated reality is the future.

1446
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,490
But what about curing cancer?

1447
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,130
And there's lots of
work being done on that.

1448
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:56,800
A lot of innovation being
done on curing cancer,

1449
00:38:56,801 --> 00:38:58,780
a lot of innovation on
all sorts of diseases.

1450
00:38:58,781 --> 00:39:01,090
I mean medical innovation has
probably never been higher.

1451
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:02,770
I think throughout the,

1452
00:39:02,771 --> 00:39:02,991
the,

1453
00:39:02,991 --> 00:39:03,301
the,

1454
00:39:03,301 --> 00:39:06,430
the full range of things that
people are interested in,

1455
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:08,470
innovation is accelerating.

1456
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:10,570
I just don't agree with that at all.

1457
00:39:10,571 --> 00:39:15,340
And people are always looking to get
negative and poo poo and try to define

1458
00:39:15,341 --> 00:39:18,430
where things are growing and not growing
because it makes them look like they're

1459
00:39:18,431 --> 00:39:19,660
smart for pointing it out.

1460
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:20,920
But I don't buy it.

1461
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:26,250
I think it's a human characteristic of
a human trait that's inherent to the

1462
00:39:26,711 --> 00:39:31,270
monkey mind that they want
to figure things out and
they build on all the things

1463
00:39:31,271 --> 00:39:32,740
that have been figured out before them.

1464
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:34,240
And it's inevitable.

1465
00:39:34,241 --> 00:39:36,460
It just continues and
goes and moves forward.

1466
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:37,331
I mean,

1467
00:39:37,331 --> 00:39:37,960
um,

1468
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,960
I have this guy in Aubrey
de Grey recently who uh,

1469
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:41,381
is,

1470
00:39:41,381 --> 00:39:41,820
um,

1471
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:43,330
is life extension,

1472
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:43,780
um,

1473
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:44,613
guy from,

1474
00:39:44,810 --> 00:39:45,930
he was originally and where was he?

1475
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:47,580
It's Columbia and now he's a,

1476
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:52,210
now he runs this separate or Oxford
when one of his major university.

1477
00:39:52,211 --> 00:39:54,490
But now he runs this,

1478
00:39:54,491 --> 00:39:55,300
um,

1479
00:39:55,300 --> 00:40:00,300
this organization that is dedicated to
finding the best and brightest minds that

1480
00:40:02,621 --> 00:40:06,810
are involved in life extension
technologies and the way genes expressed

1481
00:40:06,811 --> 00:40:07,361
themselves.

1482
00:40:07,361 --> 00:40:08,194
I mean there's loser,

1483
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:11,000
all sorts of crazy work
that's being done right now.

1484
00:40:11,001 --> 00:40:14,800
And artificial intelligence is
funding that different people.

1485
00:40:14,801 --> 00:40:15,281
I mean they're,

1486
00:40:15,281 --> 00:40:15,790
they're,

1487
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:18,580
they're actively trying to recruit people,

1488
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:19,180
um,

1489
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:19,391
to,

1490
00:40:19,391 --> 00:40:20,290
to donate money.

1491
00:40:20,291 --> 00:40:20,501
I mean,

1492
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:23,110
that's one of the reasons why I
came on this podcast to promote his,

1493
00:40:23,111 --> 00:40:23,944
uh,

1494
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,700
his cause and try to get
people to donate money to this

1495
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:27,950
warrant.

1496
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:28,630
These things.

1497
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:29,070
I and I,

1498
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:30,680
you might know more about
this than I do warrant these,

1499
00:40:30,681 --> 00:40:34,130
didn't these things used to
be funded by institutions?

1500
00:40:34,131 --> 00:40:38,390
Like wasn't apple funded by
some college like college?

1501
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:38,951
No,

1502
00:40:38,951 --> 00:40:40,240
apple was a private institution.

1503
00:40:40,241 --> 00:40:40,511
I mean,

1504
00:40:40,511 --> 00:40:42,820
I'm sure they've probably
gotten some money,

1505
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,430
probably gotten some
money from some people,

1506
00:40:45,431 --> 00:40:45,821
but no,

1507
00:40:45,821 --> 00:40:47,410
it's a privately funded institution.

1508
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:48,573
But you know what,

1509
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:49,031
there's,

1510
00:40:49,031 --> 00:40:51,550
there's a lot of money
in the private sector.

1511
00:40:51,551 --> 00:40:54,370
Like that's one of the criticisms
about like the space program,

1512
00:40:54,371 --> 00:40:57,460
like space program has kind of fallen off
because the government doesn't want to

1513
00:40:57,461 --> 00:40:58,270
fund it.

1514
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:02,770
So then Elon Musk comes wrong and this
space x thing and there's all sorts of,

1515
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:07,990
there was something that just came out
today about a Elon Musk and space x space

1516
00:41:07,991 --> 00:41:08,381
x is,

1517
00:41:08,381 --> 00:41:08,830
I don't know.

1518
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:13,780
Well they're trying to develop a
privately funded space exploration.

1519
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:14,823
Whoa.

1520
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:15,100
Yeah.

1521
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:18,610
And the idea being is that you look at
all the innovation that's gone in this

1522
00:41:18,611 --> 00:41:19,444
country,

1523
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:22,390
whether it's the invention of airplanes,

1524
00:41:22,391 --> 00:41:23,224
you know the,

1525
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:24,790
that was another thing they mentioned.

1526
00:41:24,791 --> 00:41:25,541
They said airplanes.

1527
00:41:25,541 --> 00:41:28,060
He used to be able to go in three
hours and then what happened to that?

1528
00:41:28,061 --> 00:41:29,260
That was 25 years ago.

1529
00:41:29,261 --> 00:41:30,070
Why haven't we,

1530
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,930
why haven't we built on that technology?

1531
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:32,950
What do you mean like supersonic,

1532
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:34,120
the Concorde did

1533
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:38,270
not go to like in three hours you could
be in New York or rich people died.

1534
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:39,950
People were dying from that.

1535
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:40,610
Oh yeah.

1536
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:44,720
That's one of the reasons it shutdown
and really rich people fucking gut got

1537
00:41:44,721 --> 00:41:46,340
toasted on the runway,

1538
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:47,790
but they didn't continue.

1539
00:41:47,791 --> 00:41:48,481
The innovation.

1540
00:41:48,481 --> 00:41:52,410
I would love to get somewhere in two
hours and not have to have it take to get

1541
00:41:52,411 --> 00:41:52,861
to Rome.

1542
00:41:52,861 --> 00:41:54,510
It's like 18 hours.

1543
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:55,960
It's fucking dangerous.

1544
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:56,411
Really.

1545
00:41:56,411 --> 00:42:00,700
You're going fast as shit and you're
dealing with the same kind of metals.

1546
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:01,091
I mean,

1547
00:42:01,091 --> 00:42:06,040
unless they innovate and come up with
different metals and make things much more

1548
00:42:06,041 --> 00:42:06,490
difficult.

1549
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:07,091
Elon Musk,

1550
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:08,800
space x is about to tap ship.

1551
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,190
Huge march a new spaceship.

1552
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,033
Does that go?

1553
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,860
That guy is such a fucking freak.

1554
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:16,270
Imagine being around him.

1555
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,021
Who is he?

1556
00:42:17,021 --> 00:42:17,980
I don't even understand.

1557
00:42:17,981 --> 00:42:18,870
He's like some alien him.

1558
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:20,081
So his is he,

1559
00:42:20,081 --> 00:42:21,480
does he come from some Mars?

1560
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:22,803
Mostly Mars.

1561
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:24,010
Like someone like that.

1562
00:42:24,011 --> 00:42:25,750
They must come from family money.

1563
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:26,853
Why do you say that?

1564
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:27,161
No,

1565
00:42:27,161 --> 00:42:30,040
because he was broke
just a few years back.

1566
00:42:30,041 --> 00:42:30,400
Yeah,

1567
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:30,761
they were,

1568
00:42:30,761 --> 00:42:31,001
I mean,

1569
00:42:31,001 --> 00:42:34,000
he was trying to get funding for space
x at the same time he was working on

1570
00:42:34,001 --> 00:42:37,540
Tesla and he was trying to figure out
whether or not he should abandoned one of

1571
00:42:37,541 --> 00:42:38,374
the projects.

1572
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:38,740
How,

1573
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:40,330
but so he just did investments.

1574
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:41,683
I don't know.

1575
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:42,371
I don't know.

1576
00:42:42,371 --> 00:42:43,420
I'd be talking out my ass,

1577
00:42:43,870 --> 00:42:44,430
but uh,

1578
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:44,591
he,

1579
00:42:44,591 --> 00:42:44,891
I don't,

1580
00:42:44,891 --> 00:42:46,450
I don't believe he came from money.

1581
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:47,750
Did he come from how?

1582
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:49,991
He's not that old.

1583
00:42:49,991 --> 00:42:51,340
I think he's like 40 or something.

1584
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:54,020
And so he is so it didn't,

1585
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:56,120
isn't Richard Branson trying to do that?

1586
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:57,020
Yeah.

1587
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:57,590
Virgin.

1588
00:42:57,590 --> 00:42:58,423
Yeah.

1589
00:42:58,670 --> 00:42:58,791
Yeah.

1590
00:42:58,791 --> 00:43:00,230
I mean he's funding a
lot of different things,

1591
00:43:00,231 --> 00:43:00,711
but they're,

1592
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:02,270
one of their jets just blew up.

1593
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:04,550
They had one that they were a,

1594
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:08,320
this like prototype that
they were using and a,

1595
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:10,910
it just crashed and people died.

1596
00:43:10,911 --> 00:43:11,744
AndW

1597
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:13,700
would you go in one of those?

1598
00:43:13,701 --> 00:43:15,130
I'm not going to be an early adopter.

1599
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:16,190
That's for fucking sure.

1600
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:17,390
No,

1601
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:17,680
I mean,

1602
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,230
I read and getting to a,

1603
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:20,733
you don't know who wouldn't?

1604
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:23,630
He'll be for the first to try
on the virtual space helmet,

1605
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:24,981
know he'll,

1606
00:43:24,981 --> 00:43:26,750
he'll be the first to
get one of the implants,

1607
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:28,063
but I don't,

1608
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,080
I don't have any desire
to leave this planet.

1609
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:31,460
I just think that's foolhardy.

1610
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,560
He made his money with paypal,

1611
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:34,130
paypal.

1612
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:34,311
Oh,

1613
00:43:34,311 --> 00:43:34,701
that's right.

1614
00:43:34,701 --> 00:43:35,030
Yeah.

1615
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:37,070
He created paypal part of that.

1616
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:37,460
Yeah.

1617
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:37,970
Wow.

1618
00:43:37,970 --> 00:43:38,480
Yeah.

1619
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,313
So he's just an innovator.

1620
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,153
How old is he?

1621
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:41,250
43.

1622
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:41,910
Yeah.

1623
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:42,743
Oh,

1624
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:44,780
oh 71 71.

1625
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:45,643
There you go.

1626
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:47,180
He's is just a fucking genius.

1627
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:48,043
He's iron man.

1628
00:43:48,050 --> 00:43:50,260
He's basically Tony Stark
but not quite as content.

1629
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:52,551
Yeah,

1630
00:43:52,551 --> 00:43:53,720
I mean that's funny.

1631
00:43:53,721 --> 00:43:55,130
That desire to go to Mars,

1632
00:43:55,390 --> 00:43:56,223
they could socket.

1633
00:43:56,390 --> 00:43:57,030
Those people are ready.

1634
00:43:57,030 --> 00:43:59,570
That's going to happen up
there would be terrible.

1635
00:43:59,571 --> 00:44:00,980
I have a whole bit about it in my act.

1636
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,530
I don't want to start
spewing out my jokes.

1637
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:06,580
I do like your stuff about aliens and uh,

1638
00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:07,301
you know,

1639
00:44:07,301 --> 00:44:08,860
life on other planets.

1640
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:13,390
I feel like you always kind of can connect
on these larger topics in a way that

1641
00:44:13,391 --> 00:44:16,060
I don't think I've ever
seen anyone do really.

1642
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:17,021
I mean,

1643
00:44:17,021 --> 00:44:21,070
have you ever seen people captivate
an audience talking like we're,

1644
00:44:21,071 --> 00:44:22,810
you'll have silence for,

1645
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:23,140
uh,

1646
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:23,591
you know,

1647
00:44:23,591 --> 00:44:26,590
while you're explaining and everyone's
listening and then it'll end in laughs.

1648
00:44:26,591 --> 00:44:26,870
Yeah,

1649
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:27,730
it's really cool.

1650
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:28,061
Well,

1651
00:44:28,061 --> 00:44:28,894
thanks.

1652
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:29,380
I mean,

1653
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:31,260
I've never seen anyone do that.

1654
00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:31,760
Well,

1655
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:32,010
it's just

1656
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:33,060
things that I'm interested in.

1657
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:33,660
If you're,

1658
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:33,871
if,

1659
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:34,081
if,

1660
00:44:34,081 --> 00:44:36,090
if it's not something,

1661
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:36,953
I think,

1662
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:38,430
especially with standup,

1663
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:41,370
you have to really care about
what you're talking about.

1664
00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:43,200
It's the number one thing.

1665
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,180
And when you start going
through the motions,

1666
00:44:45,181 --> 00:44:46,260
like what is sadder,

1667
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:51,330
if anything than an old comic that's been
doing the same material for 15 years.

1668
00:44:51,331 --> 00:44:53,700
You know those guys that you'll
occasionally see at the store,

1669
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:58,740
you know they get that 1215 spot and
you'll watch that same act that you've

1670
00:44:58,741 --> 00:44:59,574
seen.

1671
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:03,870
Like maybe you saw on MTV half hour
comedy hour 20 years ago or something.

1672
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:05,040
I mean I'm not joking.

1673
00:45:05,041 --> 00:45:06,060
There's a lot of those guys,

1674
00:45:06,061 --> 00:45:06,420
they just,

1675
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:08,040
and they don't care about
the material anymore.

1676
00:45:08,041 --> 00:45:09,380
There's no attachment to it anymore.

1677
00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:09,910
This is like

1678
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:11,870
the state does care about
that $16 they're making it.

1679
00:45:11,871 --> 00:45:13,090
The companies too

1680
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:17,520
keep doing it because they don't want
to admit they don't do it anymore.

1681
00:45:17,521 --> 00:45:19,110
But that happens to a lot of guys.

1682
00:45:19,111 --> 00:45:20,160
They just stop.

1683
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:21,750
They just stop being relevant.

1684
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:24,660
They stopped caring and
that's the worst aspect.

1685
00:45:24,661 --> 00:45:29,580
But the best aspect of comedy is when
someone is talking about some shit that

1686
00:45:29,581 --> 00:45:32,760
they really think about that
really means something to them.

1687
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:34,500
And that's,

1688
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:35,850
that's when the audience connects with it.

1689
00:45:35,851 --> 00:45:39,090
Cause I think stand up in some
weird form in some weird way.

1690
00:45:39,091 --> 00:45:42,930
It's kind of like a form of mass hypnosis
I think in the operates on the v very

1691
00:45:42,931 --> 00:45:47,580
similar level because you know this
like I've seen you on stage when you're

1692
00:45:47,581 --> 00:45:48,210
killing,

1693
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:49,020
right?

1694
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:50,280
And when you're killing,

1695
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:50,671
right?

1696
00:45:50,671 --> 00:45:54,660
When you're locked in and everyone's
laughing and you're hitting every pause,

1697
00:45:54,661 --> 00:45:55,440
right,

1698
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:56,700
and you have air in your,

1699
00:45:56,850 --> 00:45:57,780
you're locked in,

1700
00:45:57,781 --> 00:45:58,770
everyone's respond.

1701
00:45:59,070 --> 00:46:02,910
Those people are thinking
the way you're thinking,

1702
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:04,500
like you're guiding them.

1703
00:46:04,501 --> 00:46:04,621
Like,

1704
00:46:04,621 --> 00:46:07,110
I've watched you on stage
specifically do this.

1705
00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:09,640
Like where are you when
you're complimented.

1706
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:10,081
No,

1707
00:46:10,081 --> 00:46:10,561
I'm telling you,

1708
00:46:10,561 --> 00:46:11,394
I saw you the other night.

1709
00:46:11,790 --> 00:46:13,160
You were at the store you were killing,

1710
00:46:14,030 --> 00:46:14,580
but,

1711
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:15,600
but you know what I'm saying?

1712
00:46:15,601 --> 00:46:16,120
Like

1713
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:17,160
when you're in that moment,

1714
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:19,360
just thing idea that
they're in now with you.

1715
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:19,920
Yeah.

1716
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:20,890
They agree with you.

1717
00:46:20,891 --> 00:46:22,180
Are there in your mind,

1718
00:46:22,330 --> 00:46:23,270
well w okay.

1719
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:27,620
The other night when you were at the
store and you were talking about the

1720
00:46:27,621 --> 00:46:30,770
Armenian genocide and that
fucking guy in the audience.

1721
00:46:31,170 --> 00:46:31,801
Oh right.

1722
00:46:31,801 --> 00:46:32,430
Yeah.

1723
00:46:32,430 --> 00:46:33,263
He was like,

1724
00:46:33,450 --> 00:46:34,440
you'll racist.

1725
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:35,640
It was just an Uber joke.

1726
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:36,061
Yeah.

1727
00:46:36,061 --> 00:46:39,510
It was a joke about learning about the
Armenian genocide because she got in an

1728
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:42,090
Uber driver within Armenia and
he was fucking lecturing you.

1729
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:42,691
Exactly.

1730
00:46:42,691 --> 00:46:43,080
Yes.

1731
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:43,890
It was funny,

1732
00:46:43,890 --> 00:46:46,950
but it was the way he handled it,

1733
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:51,060
the way eat like you led
the whole audience along,

1734
00:46:51,061 --> 00:46:52,020
like everybody was with you.

1735
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:55,320
The reason why everybody's with you
is because you were locked in to this

1736
00:46:55,321 --> 00:46:57,300
subject who were locked into this idea.

1737
00:46:57,370 --> 00:46:58,420
And I knew it was true.

1738
00:46:58,820 --> 00:46:59,380
Yeah.

1739
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:00,213
Yeah.

1740
00:47:00,310 --> 00:47:01,143
But so yeah,

1741
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:01,931
but you know what I'm saying,

1742
00:47:01,931 --> 00:47:02,590
like this isn't,

1743
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:04,390
this isn't anything casual.

1744
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:06,610
This wasn't anything that you
really didn't give a fuck about.

1745
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:11,170
Like in that moment I was with you who
the whole audience was with you or like

1746
00:47:11,171 --> 00:47:12,580
locked into your mind.

1747
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:13,960
Like I think that's what,

1748
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,390
when someone's killing on stage,

1749
00:47:16,930 --> 00:47:17,470
they might,

1750
00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:19,060
you might as well be getting
them to quit smoking.

1751
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:22,450
You might as well be getting that audience
to lose weight or just stop beating

1752
00:47:22,451 --> 00:47:24,370
their dog or whatever the fuck
you're trying to get hypnotized.

1753
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:24,621
Well,

1754
00:47:24,621 --> 00:47:25,560
how do you get into that?

1755
00:47:25,561 --> 00:47:27,210
Hit hypnos like how do you,

1756
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:28,201
yeah,

1757
00:47:28,201 --> 00:47:28,531
how do you,

1758
00:47:28,531 --> 00:47:28,891
how do you,

1759
00:47:28,891 --> 00:47:33,160
cause I didn't Chris rock say
you have to be like part preacher

1760
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:34,170
[inaudible] a little bit.

1761
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:35,970
Well his style is very much preacher.

1762
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:37,373
You know,

1763
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:40,550
Sam Kennison obviously was a
preacher he wasn't running with,

1764
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:40,891
oh,

1765
00:47:40,891 --> 00:47:45,891
you didn't know no license plate on his
HBO special said x Rev on his corvette.

1766
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:48,750
That's,

1767
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:49,583
yeah.

1768
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:50,820
And that was his,

1769
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:51,600
you know,

1770
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:52,433
that was his thing.

1771
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:54,990
I wonder if there's tricks for sure.

1772
00:47:55,170 --> 00:47:55,700
Ooh,

1773
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:58,150
to lock in to get into that much.

1774
00:47:58,330 --> 00:47:58,601
Well,

1775
00:47:58,601 --> 00:48:00,820
one thing I think you can
do is really try to feel it.

1776
00:48:00,821 --> 00:48:01,151
Like I've,

1777
00:48:01,151 --> 00:48:03,790
I've definitely felt how I can
turn around a set where I'm like,

1778
00:48:03,791 --> 00:48:05,290
this is going through the motions.

1779
00:48:05,291 --> 00:48:08,050
They're not connecting and
it's a long set on the road.

1780
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:08,381
So I'm like,

1781
00:48:08,381 --> 00:48:09,690
I have 40 more minutes left.

1782
00:48:10,210 --> 00:48:10,760
Ooh.

1783
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:11,530
You know,

1784
00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:12,250
so then it's like,

1785
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:14,500
oh well maybe I can in the middle of this,

1786
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:18,250
try to start feeling what I'm
saying for the first time.

1787
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:22,600
I think that can maybe help a little
bit to really like almost like an acting

1788
00:48:22,630 --> 00:48:23,351
exercise.

1789
00:48:23,351 --> 00:48:23,800
Like,

1790
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,990
because sometimes you'll say the words
and you're not even thinking about what

1791
00:48:25,991 --> 00:48:26,740
they mean.

1792
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:27,670
You can't do that.

1793
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:28,391
It happened.

1794
00:48:28,391 --> 00:48:30,670
I mean two shows on a Saturday,

1795
00:48:30,770 --> 00:48:32,020
two shows on a Friday.

1796
00:48:32,021 --> 00:48:34,960
It's like I don't even know what's coming
out of my mouth half the time and I

1797
00:48:34,961 --> 00:48:38,020
can't tell you how many times
on my second show I'm like,

1798
00:48:38,050 --> 00:48:40,120
I'm talking and while I'm
talking I'm looking at people.

1799
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:43,510
I'm looking at people's faces to see if
I've done this joke already in this set

1800
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:44,790
because I,

1801
00:48:44,790 --> 00:48:47,470
I'm all over the place and I
don't have an order sometimes.

1802
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:47,950
Right.

1803
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:48,790
So then how can you,

1804
00:48:48,791 --> 00:48:49,510
I just can't,

1805
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:50,650
I can't keep track of it.

1806
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:52,630
I always write set lists.

1807
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:53,650
I need to start doing that.

1808
00:48:53,651 --> 00:48:55,330
Even if I don't use a set list,

1809
00:48:55,331 --> 00:48:57,310
at least I write it out so that,

1810
00:48:57,311 --> 00:48:57,641
you know,

1811
00:48:57,641 --> 00:49:00,040
if you've like in the board or
like this doesn't go up top,

1812
00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:03,940
what I'll fuck around sometimes and
I'll just decided to do my closing bit

1813
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:04,630
first.

1814
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:06,400
But then how do you know the club yet?

1815
00:49:06,430 --> 00:49:07,780
So you gotta be careful.

1816
00:49:07,810 --> 00:49:08,650
But I just,

1817
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:13,710
I think that at least my style of comedy
is I like to just go with wherever my

1818
00:49:14,531 --> 00:49:15,550
brain wants to go.

1819
00:49:15,610 --> 00:49:16,540
And if my brain,

1820
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:19,540
like if I'll start talking about something
and something comes up and then my

1821
00:49:19,541 --> 00:49:22,030
closing bit is appropriate at that moment.

1822
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:22,570
Yeah.

1823
00:49:22,570 --> 00:49:23,403
I just go with it.

1824
00:49:23,470 --> 00:49:23,711
And then,

1825
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,640
well how are you going to close the show?

1826
00:49:24,650 --> 00:49:25,060
I don't,

1827
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:26,110
I close on another bit.

1828
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:31,590
You know the idea is to get a bit that's
so get any bit that's so strong you can

1829
00:49:31,591 --> 00:49:32,424
close with it.

1830
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:34,480
And if not all your bits
should be like that.

1831
00:49:34,481 --> 00:49:34,840
Yeah.

1832
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:39,220
All your bits should be like to a point
where they aren't always like you got to

1833
00:49:39,221 --> 00:49:39,641
build them.

1834
00:49:39,641 --> 00:49:44,641
Like there's a lot of like I abandoned
my act in [inaudible] in November because

1835
00:49:44,771 --> 00:49:46,810
that's when my new comedy
central special came out.

1836
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:48,310
So I passed November.

1837
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:48,790
Yes.

1838
00:49:48,790 --> 00:49:52,690
So all this stuff from November
to now is all completely new.

1839
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:55,470
So pick one of those things to close on a,

1840
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:56,260
at a club,

1841
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:57,070
they're dead.

1842
00:49:57,070 --> 00:49:57,903
They're dead to me.

1843
00:49:57,930 --> 00:50:00,710
Oh man was pressure.

1844
00:50:03,270 --> 00:50:03,811
So one,

1845
00:50:03,811 --> 00:50:04,680
one comedy special.

1846
00:50:04,681 --> 00:50:05,100
Your crystal.

1847
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:06,990
He is on a second comedy
special this year.

1848
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:07,913
It's too much.

1849
00:50:08,190 --> 00:50:10,710
It's too much for me to like keep up with,

1850
00:50:10,850 --> 00:50:11,361
well he's the,

1851
00:50:11,361 --> 00:50:12,950
he did his last one over a year ago

1852
00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:15,420
saying it's Ah,

1853
00:50:15,970 --> 00:50:16,190
I'm,

1854
00:50:16,190 --> 00:50:19,610
I'm filming mine in three weeks
and some of the jokes are like,

1855
00:50:19,611 --> 00:50:19,881
you know,

1856
00:50:19,881 --> 00:50:20,750
two years old,

1857
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:22,670
but I'm like so sick of them now.

1858
00:50:22,810 --> 00:50:23,643
I'm like,

1859
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:24,800
how am I going to avoid,

1860
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:25,221
I know.

1861
00:50:25,221 --> 00:50:25,461
I'm like,

1862
00:50:25,461 --> 00:50:28,190
how am I going to find in one week,

1863
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:29,180
nine days?

1864
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:34,240
How am I going to find this energy
to make it feel fresh for my taping?

1865
00:50:34,401 --> 00:50:35,234
It's so hard.

1866
00:50:36,050 --> 00:50:36,381
No,

1867
00:50:36,381 --> 00:50:37,490
I'm not going to smoke pot then.

1868
00:50:37,491 --> 00:50:39,170
I'm definitely not going to
know if I've done it before.

1869
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:40,513
That helps you.

1870
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:40,911
Is that,

1871
00:50:40,911 --> 00:50:42,660
what are the tricks to
get into that hypnosis?

1872
00:50:43,590 --> 00:50:44,220
Yeah.

1873
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:44,461
Yeah.

1874
00:50:44,461 --> 00:50:45,420
It gets you in the groove.

1875
00:50:45,690 --> 00:50:46,950
It makes me very sensitive,

1876
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:48,840
like almost paranoid.

1877
00:50:49,090 --> 00:50:49,900
So you're,

1878
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:51,760
you're of the mind of
doing it before you go,

1879
00:50:51,850 --> 00:50:52,860
you go to [inaudible]?

1880
00:50:52,970 --> 00:50:54,460
Not after both.

1881
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:55,893
I like both.

1882
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:58,353
I like pot.

1883
00:50:58,740 --> 00:50:59,510
I did too.

1884
00:50:59,510 --> 00:51:01,060
It works great for my personality.

1885
00:51:01,450 --> 00:51:01,751
Yeah.

1886
00:51:01,751 --> 00:51:02,920
That's what my therapist said,

1887
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:03,581
cause I was like,

1888
00:51:03,581 --> 00:51:04,570
I think I might smoke.

1889
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:04,901
You know,

1890
00:51:04,901 --> 00:51:05,920
maybe I shouldn't smoke pot.

1891
00:51:05,921 --> 00:51:06,401
And he was like,

1892
00:51:06,401 --> 00:51:06,731
no,

1893
00:51:06,731 --> 00:51:07,331
you're chill.

1894
00:51:07,331 --> 00:51:08,320
It makes you more chill.

1895
00:51:08,321 --> 00:51:09,250
It's totally fine.

1896
00:51:09,251 --> 00:51:10,980
Like you have the right vibe for it.

1897
00:51:11,830 --> 00:51:12,140
Um,

1898
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:13,260
if you enjoy it though,

1899
00:51:13,430 --> 00:51:14,550
I just think it's,

1900
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:15,620
it can be tricky.

1901
00:51:15,621 --> 00:51:16,880
You can definitely fuck with you.

1902
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:20,300
And if you're one of those people that's
like really impulsive or a really,

1903
00:51:20,301 --> 00:51:21,080
uh,

1904
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:25,040
you have addictive tendencies and you
like to do things a little bit too much.

1905
00:51:25,041 --> 00:51:25,281
Yeah,

1906
00:51:25,281 --> 00:51:25,820
it can be a,

1907
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:26,511
it can be a problem.

1908
00:51:26,511 --> 00:51:29,210
Like I know people that do
smoke pot all day every day,

1909
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:30,260
which I don't recommend.

1910
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:32,600
I take big long breaks,

1911
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:33,570
you know.

1912
00:51:33,570 --> 00:51:34,261
Can you say breaks?

1913
00:51:34,261 --> 00:51:35,310
You mean breaks in the day?

1914
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:35,621
No,

1915
00:51:35,621 --> 00:51:35,941
I mean look,

1916
00:51:35,941 --> 00:51:38,400
weeks I like to take like a week off,

1917
00:51:38,430 --> 00:51:39,330
two weeks off,

1918
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:40,770
and then when I go back to it,

1919
00:51:40,771 --> 00:51:41,790
I appreciate it more.

1920
00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:44,400
I don't like doing anything all the time.

1921
00:51:44,790 --> 00:51:45,623
Like I take,

1922
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:47,550
I'll take breaks off working out,

1923
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:49,260
I'll take breaks off of everything.

1924
00:51:49,261 --> 00:51:50,640
I think it's important to take.

1925
00:51:50,641 --> 00:51:51,241
I'll take bricks off,

1926
00:51:51,241 --> 00:51:52,074
stand up.

1927
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:52,921
Like sometimes I'm like,

1928
00:51:52,921 --> 00:51:54,180
I need a fucking week off.

1929
00:51:54,181 --> 00:51:55,140
I'm just taking a week off.

1930
00:51:55,141 --> 00:51:56,220
I'm not doing shit this week.

1931
00:51:56,221 --> 00:51:57,420
I'm not calling in for spots,

1932
00:51:57,421 --> 00:51:58,320
I'm not doing shit.

1933
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:02,890
I like to learn about your phone that
has the constant information coming

1934
00:52:02,891 --> 00:52:03,311
through.

1935
00:52:03,311 --> 00:52:04,600
We need you in this,

1936
00:52:04,601 --> 00:52:06,760
that respond emails.

1937
00:52:06,970 --> 00:52:08,980
It's just getting like more and more,

1938
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:09,590
more.

1939
00:52:09,590 --> 00:52:11,690
I'm notoriously difficult to get ahold of.

1940
00:52:11,691 --> 00:52:12,441
Like my manager,

1941
00:52:12,441 --> 00:52:15,500
they're always laughing about I'm
the one client that will just,

1942
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:17,240
I'll abandon my phone.

1943
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:21,320
I like think like most people are
constantly calling constantly like,

1944
00:52:21,321 --> 00:52:22,071
what's going on with this?

1945
00:52:22,071 --> 00:52:22,904
What's going on with that?

1946
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:24,260
I'm the total opposite.

1947
00:52:24,530 --> 00:52:25,670
Like they can't even find me.

1948
00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:26,930
Like I vanish.

1949
00:52:26,990 --> 00:52:28,490
I shut my phone off and I just don't,

1950
00:52:28,491 --> 00:52:32,600
I don't respond because I feel like if
you have fuck you money and you don't say

1951
00:52:32,601 --> 00:52:33,321
fuck you,

1952
00:52:33,321 --> 00:52:34,880
you don't deserve fuck you money.

1953
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:37,280
What are you doing with that money?

1954
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:38,600
Freaking out all the time.

1955
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:41,780
Why don't you just say
fuck you just chill.

1956
00:52:41,781 --> 00:52:42,500
Just chill.

1957
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:43,640
Got to get that money.

1958
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:44,031
Yeah.

1959
00:52:44,031 --> 00:52:49,031
You got to enjoy the whole process and
part of enjoying the whole process is and

1960
00:52:49,081 --> 00:52:50,180
enjoying the whole,

1961
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:51,073
the moment,

1962
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:54,410
like all the moments
like I like doing like a,

1963
00:52:54,411 --> 00:52:55,310
we were talking about yoga.

1964
00:52:55,310 --> 00:52:56,300
I'm like doing yoga.

1965
00:52:56,301 --> 00:52:56,960
I like,

1966
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:58,280
I like to an archery.

1967
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:00,470
I like going and shooting
arrows at targets.

1968
00:53:00,471 --> 00:53:00,860
It's,

1969
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:01,850
it's exciting.

1970
00:53:01,851 --> 00:53:02,630
It's fun.

1971
00:53:02,630 --> 00:53:03,710
I like doing different shit.

1972
00:53:03,711 --> 00:53:05,090
That's why I like doing Jujitsu.

1973
00:53:05,091 --> 00:53:06,020
That's why I like doing,

1974
00:53:06,410 --> 00:53:08,290
I like doing Moitai.

1975
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:09,680
I like doing weird shit.

1976
00:53:09,710 --> 00:53:14,710
I like doing things and I think that you
get locked into one thing for too long.

1977
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:17,690
I think it limits you in what limits your,

1978
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:20,420
your point of references limits your mind.

1979
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:22,960
Like there's certain people that
like all they give a fuck about it.

1980
00:53:22,961 --> 00:53:23,870
It's like say golf.

1981
00:53:24,110 --> 00:53:25,100
That's all they care about.

1982
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:25,441
They're like,

1983
00:53:25,441 --> 00:53:26,640
you'll see them like fake golf,

1984
00:53:26,641 --> 00:53:27,390
swimming,

1985
00:53:27,390 --> 00:53:28,530
swinging during the day.

1986
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:30,560
I don't think as an artist

1987
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:31,200
especially,

1988
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,033
I hate golf.

1989
00:53:32,690 --> 00:53:34,040
I think it's like a problem.

1990
00:53:34,610 --> 00:53:35,930
I think it's the worst aesthetic.

1991
00:53:35,931 --> 00:53:37,220
I think it ruins hotels.

1992
00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:38,900
I think it's ruins hotels.

1993
00:53:38,930 --> 00:53:41,420
It's just like whenever I go to
a hotel that is like golf scent,

1994
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:42,890
like centered around golf,

1995
00:53:42,891 --> 00:53:43,611
I don't want to be there.

1996
00:53:43,611 --> 00:53:45,970
It's like old white
Republicans walking around.

1997
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:49,820
They all at crusty and they're pastels
and they just seem like they drank too

1998
00:53:49,821 --> 00:53:51,560
much in a bad sense of humor.

1999
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:55,190
I just think it's an ugly aesthetic and
it's terrible for the environment to

2000
00:53:55,191 --> 00:53:56,630
keep those golf courses green.

2001
00:53:57,130 --> 00:53:58,390
It is in California,

2002
00:53:58,480 --> 00:53:59,051
in Seattle.

2003
00:53:59,051 --> 00:54:00,190
It's really not that big a deal.

2004
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:00,960
Right.

2005
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:01,631
In California.

2006
00:54:01,631 --> 00:54:02,200
Yeah.

2007
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:02,500
It's,

2008
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:03,460
it's not cool.

2009
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:04,750
There's still conservative.

2010
00:54:04,930 --> 00:54:05,411
I just hate it.

2011
00:54:05,411 --> 00:54:07,090
There's a lot of conservative
people that play golf.

2012
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:07,420
It's,

2013
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:08,350
it's a business thing.

2014
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:10,040
A lot of guys who uh,

2015
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:10,661
play golf,

2016
00:54:10,661 --> 00:54:12,820
they do a lot of business
meetings on the golf course.

2017
00:54:12,821 --> 00:54:16,930
I think it gets them away from women
because they get out there by themselves.

2018
00:54:17,050 --> 00:54:17,861
All a bunch of guys,

2019
00:54:17,861 --> 00:54:20,980
they drink beer and they talk
shit and they walk balls around.

2020
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:24,610
Cause I think a lot of people are
like massively suppressed by office

2021
00:54:24,611 --> 00:54:29,560
environments and they just seek out
any possible way that they can be

2022
00:54:29,561 --> 00:54:30,394
themselves.

2023
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:31,473
Yeah.

2024
00:54:31,690 --> 00:54:32,140
It's just,

2025
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:32,973
it's a valve.

2026
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:34,450
You know,

2027
00:54:34,450 --> 00:54:35,283
for a lot of men?

2028
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:35,661
No,

2029
00:54:35,661 --> 00:54:35,721
I,

2030
00:54:35,721 --> 00:54:36,920
I was thinking about like,

2031
00:54:36,921 --> 00:54:38,630
because I'm so stressed
out about my special,

2032
00:54:38,631 --> 00:54:40,220
which I'm taping in a week and I'm like,

2033
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:42,350
all I care about is it being over.

2034
00:54:42,351 --> 00:54:43,430
I just want it to be over.

2035
00:54:43,431 --> 00:54:44,410
I just want to get over it.

2036
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:45,231
And then I'm like,

2037
00:54:45,231 --> 00:54:46,160
as soon as the special is done,

2038
00:54:46,161 --> 00:54:47,630
I'm gonna have something
else I have to focus on.

2039
00:54:47,631 --> 00:54:48,740
So if my whole life is like,

2040
00:54:48,741 --> 00:54:48,951
God,

2041
00:54:48,951 --> 00:54:50,240
I hope this is over soon.

2042
00:54:50,510 --> 00:54:51,920
It's like that's no way to live.

2043
00:54:52,070 --> 00:54:52,461
Yeah.

2044
00:54:52,461 --> 00:54:54,070
But the pressure is,

2045
00:54:54,190 --> 00:54:55,070
is overwhelming.

2046
00:54:55,071 --> 00:54:55,970
Like as a comic,

2047
00:54:55,971 --> 00:54:57,800
especially because you're the writer,

2048
00:54:57,801 --> 00:54:58,550
the producer,

2049
00:54:58,550 --> 00:54:59,870
the creator and the performer.

2050
00:54:59,871 --> 00:55:04,160
There's a lot of shit going on when you
get on that stage nine days from now and

2051
00:55:04,161 --> 00:55:04,490
do it,

2052
00:55:04,490 --> 00:55:08,090
just the weight of your world
is completely on your shoulders.

2053
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:10,730
It's very different than any
other style of performing.

2054
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:13,790
It's different than music
because you have a backup band.

2055
00:55:13,791 --> 00:55:17,810
It's different than a sitcom because
there's writers and directors,

2056
00:55:17,811 --> 00:55:18,800
there's a lot of shit going on.

2057
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:19,760
You're,

2058
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:20,960
you're responsible for it.

2059
00:55:20,961 --> 00:55:21,500
Totally.

2060
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:23,210
And that wears on people.

2061
00:55:23,211 --> 00:55:24,080
And a lot of times,

2062
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:28,400
well it wears on people is the way you
look at it and the way you approach it.

2063
00:55:28,401 --> 00:55:29,900
And I've been on both sides.

2064
00:55:29,901 --> 00:55:34,901
I've been where I felt great and I felt
like really loose and comfortable and

2065
00:55:35,151 --> 00:55:36,410
not worried about it at all.

2066
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:40,880
And then I've also been in a place where
I was like really fucking stressed out

2067
00:55:40,881 --> 00:55:41,714
about it.

2068
00:55:41,870 --> 00:55:42,470
You know I've been,

2069
00:55:42,470 --> 00:55:46,850
I've been in both places and I think
a lot of it is my appreciation for the

2070
00:55:46,851 --> 00:55:47,684
process.

2071
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:50,870
I think when I appreciate the process
am I look at it the right way,

2072
00:55:51,050 --> 00:55:56,050
which have kind of like cultivated over
the last decade or so of my life that

2073
00:55:56,750 --> 00:55:57,441
when I really,

2074
00:55:57,441 --> 00:55:59,540
really appreciate it then it's all fun.

2075
00:55:59,570 --> 00:56:01,850
And even though there's
like pressure and stress,

2076
00:56:01,851 --> 00:56:03,200
it's fun and I enjoy it.

2077
00:56:03,201 --> 00:56:03,410
Yeah.

2078
00:56:03,410 --> 00:56:04,460
When you say process,

2079
00:56:04,461 --> 00:56:05,450
what do you mean exactly?

2080
00:56:05,451 --> 00:56:09,350
Like just the fact that you've been able
to like think of these jokes and write

2081
00:56:09,351 --> 00:56:11,920
them and perform them
and people love them.

2082
00:56:12,290 --> 00:56:12,471
Well,

2083
00:56:12,471 --> 00:56:14,510
the whole process of creating set,

2084
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:15,770
I mean creating a bit,

2085
00:56:16,190 --> 00:56:16,660
you know,

2086
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:19,870
it is cool how it works cause it's
like you'll see this bit and it's like,

2087
00:56:19,871 --> 00:56:20,320
wait,

2088
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:21,370
did this really happen to me?

2089
00:56:21,371 --> 00:56:21,581
You're like,

2090
00:56:21,581 --> 00:56:21,851
wait,

2091
00:56:21,851 --> 00:56:22,780
this did happen.

2092
00:56:22,781 --> 00:56:23,614
Like this,

2093
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:24,850
this girl is a bitch.

2094
00:56:24,851 --> 00:56:28,030
And then I thought of this idea and then
it turned into this and then I added

2095
00:56:28,031 --> 00:56:31,360
this to it and then made
it connect with this bit.

2096
00:56:31,361 --> 00:56:31,721
It's like,

2097
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:31,901
yeah.

2098
00:56:31,901 --> 00:56:32,620
So it is,

2099
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:34,390
it is collaborative and you know,

2100
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:37,110
you're collaborating with your
life to like make these things.

2101
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:40,600
I had a freaky fucking nightmare last
night that I'm just now remembering.

2102
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:41,760
Uh,

2103
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:43,710
and in the nightmare I
woke up in the morning,

2104
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:46,750
take a leak and as I woke
up I woke up like with it,

2105
00:56:46,751 --> 00:56:48,010
like I woke up at like five 30.

2106
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:50,020
And what does nightmare in my head,

2107
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:50,950
it was like,

2108
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:51,201
Oh,

2109
00:56:51,201 --> 00:56:54,940
weird nightmare where I could not
remember whether or not I had committed a

2110
00:56:54,941 --> 00:56:59,740
crime and I was trying to remember
whether or not it was a dream or it was an

2111
00:56:59,741 --> 00:57:02,890
actual crime that I had committed
and that was the nightmare.

2112
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:05,650
The nightmare was that I had like I had,

2113
00:57:05,770 --> 00:57:06,910
I was really confused.

2114
00:57:06,911 --> 00:57:07,061
Like,

2115
00:57:07,061 --> 00:57:10,840
did I do something fucked up or is
this bullshit or is this a dream?

2116
00:57:11,110 --> 00:57:12,280
And then I woke up and I was like,

2117
00:57:12,281 --> 00:57:12,730
wait a minute,

2118
00:57:12,730 --> 00:57:15,880
this is a dream that I dreamed that I did.

2119
00:57:15,881 --> 00:57:18,430
Something fucked up or I was confused.

2120
00:57:18,790 --> 00:57:19,960
It was really weird.

2121
00:57:19,961 --> 00:57:20,620
So scary.

2122
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:20,980
Yeah,

2123
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:21,611
it was really weird.

2124
00:57:21,611 --> 00:57:22,444
But

2125
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:24,970
I dunno how it relates,

2126
00:57:24,971 --> 00:57:25,900
but the idea,

2127
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:29,350
I think one of the ways it relates is
like when you're putting together a bit,

2128
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:33,190
it's almost like it's
not even you doing it.

2129
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:36,010
It's almost like when I'm on stage and um,

2130
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:39,510
and I'm really in the
groove and the these long,

2131
00:57:39,550 --> 00:57:43,960
sometimes I'll line like a tag will
come on up fucking nowhere and it's the

2132
00:57:43,961 --> 00:57:46,120
perfect tag and then you go,

2133
00:57:46,121 --> 00:57:47,110
did I just write that?

2134
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:47,973
Is that mine?

2135
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:48,630
Yeah.

2136
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:49,070
Yeah.

2137
00:57:49,070 --> 00:57:49,903
Out of nowhere.

2138
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:54,960
And the only way that works is if you
allow yourself to go into these fucking

2139
00:57:55,001 --> 00:57:57,520
weird places while you're on stage.

2140
00:57:57,521 --> 00:58:01,990
And he'd go down dark alleys and sometimes
there's no fucking way out and it

2141
00:58:01,991 --> 00:58:02,651
doesn't work.

2142
00:58:02,651 --> 00:58:03,011
And you've got to,

2143
00:58:03,011 --> 00:58:05,380
you got to talk your
way out of that alley.

2144
00:58:05,830 --> 00:58:08,020
I'm gonna figure out how to
put it back together again.

2145
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:10,270
That's what I'm talking
like that's the process.

2146
00:58:10,540 --> 00:58:12,340
The process is uncertainty.

2147
00:58:12,341 --> 00:58:13,420
It's confusion,

2148
00:58:13,421 --> 00:58:13,990
it's like,

2149
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:18,010
and then finally a finished thing and
you can only hold on to that finish thing

2150
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:18,390
for,

2151
00:58:18,390 --> 00:58:19,570
it's like a sand castle.

2152
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:20,501
Like you build it,

2153
00:58:20,501 --> 00:58:21,101
it's beautiful.

2154
00:58:21,101 --> 00:58:22,990
But the fucking waters common bitch,

2155
00:58:23,490 --> 00:58:24,360
the harvest Carmen.

2156
00:58:24,910 --> 00:58:25,960
And you've got to accept that.

2157
00:58:25,990 --> 00:58:26,561
And people are like,

2158
00:58:26,561 --> 00:58:30,190
I want to turn it into summit and keep
it forever and I want to live in it.

2159
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:31,180
You can't live in it,

2160
00:58:31,330 --> 00:58:32,163
you can't live in it,

2161
00:58:32,450 --> 00:58:34,370
but you shouldn't be afraid of like,

2162
00:58:34,371 --> 00:58:37,100
what if I bring a whole bunch of people
to see you and I loved one of your alien

2163
00:58:37,101 --> 00:58:37,521
bits.

2164
00:58:37,521 --> 00:58:38,330
And I'm like,

2165
00:58:38,330 --> 00:58:38,571
yeah,

2166
00:58:38,571 --> 00:58:38,811
wait,

2167
00:58:38,811 --> 00:58:41,210
he does this part and then
you're doing all new stuff.

2168
00:58:41,211 --> 00:58:41,481
It's like,

2169
00:58:41,481 --> 00:58:43,160
why can't you bring a few people?

2170
00:58:43,161 --> 00:58:48,161
Like that idea that like nobody wants
anything that has already been released or

2171
00:58:49,371 --> 00:58:50,204
recorded.

2172
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:52,460
Everything must be new all the time.

2173
00:58:52,550 --> 00:58:52,970
Well,

2174
00:58:52,970 --> 00:58:54,800
I don't think everything
needs to be new all the time,

2175
00:58:54,801 --> 00:58:56,270
but my stuff has a cycle,

2176
00:58:56,780 --> 00:58:57,800
at least from me though.

2177
00:58:57,801 --> 00:59:02,801
I do my best work when it has a cycle
because I feel like if I'm working on a,

2178
00:59:03,050 --> 00:59:05,510
if I'm doing a an old
bit that's already done.

2179
00:59:05,970 --> 00:59:06,470
Um,

2180
00:59:06,470 --> 00:59:07,370
nothing wrong with that.

2181
00:59:07,430 --> 00:59:08,263
There's nothing wrong with it.

2182
00:59:08,270 --> 00:59:13,220
But I feel like at a certain point in
time that's taking away from creating a

2183
00:59:13,221 --> 00:59:13,970
new bid,

2184
00:59:13,970 --> 00:59:18,970
it's taking away from making a new bit
as good as those old bits and that energy

2185
00:59:19,341 --> 00:59:20,630
that I'll put into that old bit.

2186
00:59:21,590 --> 00:59:21,980
It's,

2187
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:22,580
you know,

2188
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:25,490
especially if I'm doing it all the
time or even adding new tags to it.

2189
00:59:25,790 --> 00:59:28,280
Like I could be adding
new stuff to a new bid.

2190
00:59:28,281 --> 00:59:31,220
I could make be making a new bit
as good as one of my old bits.

2191
00:59:31,850 --> 00:59:32,780
So that's just

2192
00:59:34,410 --> 00:59:35,180
the only way.

2193
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:39,440
The way it's good for me is
if I'm constantly updating.

2194
00:59:39,650 --> 00:59:43,880
I give myself like a year
and a half and then I'm done.

2195
00:59:43,881 --> 00:59:46,640
I'm moving on like a year and a
half and then I have to film it.

2196
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:48,260
How many specials have you done?

2197
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:51,730
Let me see.

2198
00:59:51,730 --> 00:59:52,250
Um,

2199
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:52,671
one,

2200
00:59:52,671 --> 00:59:53,540
two,

2201
00:59:53,570 --> 00:59:54,440
three,

2202
00:59:54,441 --> 00:59:56,030
four,

2203
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:56,893
five,

2204
00:59:59,090 --> 01:00:00,620
six,

2205
01:00:00,621 --> 01:00:01,670
seven.

2206
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:04,110
You're prolific energy.

2207
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:04,740
Eight,

2208
01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:05,573
seven or eight.

2209
01:00:05,580 --> 01:00:06,413
I'm trying to figure out,

2210
01:00:07,350 --> 01:00:10,290
I was watching this documentary
on like folk music and it was,

2211
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:12,030
but someone was saying,

2212
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:13,133
don't laugh.

2213
01:00:13,770 --> 01:00:14,071
Fuck.

2214
01:00:14,071 --> 01:00:14,970
She's hilarious.

2215
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:16,980
I mean hundreds isn't that far from folk?

2216
01:00:17,070 --> 01:00:17,890
Um,

2217
01:00:17,890 --> 01:00:18,723
yes he is.

2218
01:00:18,730 --> 01:00:19,920
I mean he's rock and roll,

2219
01:00:19,921 --> 01:00:24,270
but like he came from that
era of like hippies anyway.

2220
01:00:24,570 --> 01:00:25,403
Hmm.

2221
01:00:25,410 --> 01:00:25,621
Yeah,

2222
01:00:25,621 --> 01:00:26,750
he definitely came from the hippie.

2223
01:00:26,970 --> 01:00:27,770
Some like,

2224
01:00:27,770 --> 01:00:28,370
you know why?

2225
01:00:28,370 --> 01:00:29,400
Cause he likes white buzzy.

2226
01:00:30,150 --> 01:00:31,160
That's what was up with that.

2227
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:33,180
There's only one way.

2228
01:00:33,181 --> 01:00:34,170
You got to find the hippies.

2229
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:34,641
I mean,

2230
01:00:34,641 --> 01:00:35,121
he has like,

2231
01:00:35,121 --> 01:00:37,760
he has a whole album of like low key.

2232
01:00:38,150 --> 01:00:38,421
No,

2233
01:00:38,421 --> 01:00:41,740
he definitely will catch on the sand.

2234
01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:45,140
It's not all like electronic
or electric insanity.

2235
01:00:45,260 --> 01:00:45,471
No,

2236
01:00:45,471 --> 01:00:46,304
you're definitely right.

2237
01:00:46,370 --> 01:00:46,911
But anyway,

2238
01:00:46,911 --> 01:00:51,380
so I'm watching this documentary and it
was some folk artists was saying like,

2239
01:00:51,381 --> 01:00:52,580
your first albums,

2240
01:00:53,060 --> 01:00:53,510
you know,

2241
01:00:53,510 --> 01:00:54,320
easy,

2242
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:55,340
but your second album,

2243
01:00:55,341 --> 01:00:57,920
that's how they can tell you're made
up because your first album is like 10

2244
01:00:57,921 --> 01:00:58,760
years of struggle.

2245
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:02,090
This is what I've had to save for the
last decade and now it's finally coming

2246
01:01:02,091 --> 01:01:02,241
out.

2247
01:01:02,241 --> 01:01:03,050
Whereas like,

2248
01:01:03,050 --> 01:01:04,910
it's a hit your second album,

2249
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:05,960
here's a year,

2250
01:01:06,290 --> 01:01:07,550
here's what I can come up with.

2251
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:08,301
You know,

2252
01:01:08,301 --> 01:01:08,511
it's,

2253
01:01:08,511 --> 01:01:09,231
it's not as,

2254
01:01:09,231 --> 01:01:09,431
it's,

2255
01:01:09,431 --> 01:01:10,061
it's like it's,

2256
01:01:10,061 --> 01:01:10,910
it's just harder.

2257
01:01:11,110 --> 01:01:11,381
Yeah.

2258
01:01:11,381 --> 01:01:16,381
My first CD I did was in 1999
and I started comedy and 88.

2259
01:01:17,430 --> 01:01:17,941
Right.

2260
01:01:17,941 --> 01:01:19,070
So that's like a mall.

2261
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:19,750
Yeah.

2262
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:21,960
So much of you that you've been,

2263
01:01:21,961 --> 01:01:22,794
you know,

2264
01:01:23,140 --> 01:01:24,220
my next one a year later.

2265
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:26,080
And that was kind of weird.

2266
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:28,710
And it's also hard to
stay funny a year later.

2267
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:28,850
Did,

2268
01:01:28,850 --> 01:01:29,681
was it just as good?

2269
01:01:29,681 --> 01:01:30,350
Yeah.

2270
01:01:30,350 --> 01:01:30,981
Um,

2271
01:01:30,981 --> 01:01:31,970
I don't know.

2272
01:01:31,971 --> 01:01:32,960
I'm not sure.

2273
01:01:32,961 --> 01:01:34,460
I think they all suck now,

2274
01:01:35,110 --> 01:01:35,361
you know,

2275
01:01:35,361 --> 01:01:37,820
and I go back and listen
to my old stuff like eight.

2276
01:01:37,850 --> 01:01:38,531
It really?

2277
01:01:38,531 --> 01:01:38,690
Yeah.

2278
01:01:38,690 --> 01:01:42,140
I can't listen to my old stuff
until about 2006 like shiny,

2279
01:01:42,141 --> 01:01:42,980
happy Jihad.

2280
01:01:42,981 --> 01:01:46,640
That was my 2006 comedy central
special or comedy central.

2281
01:01:46,641 --> 01:01:47,421
A CD.

2282
01:01:47,421 --> 01:01:48,260
I still like that.

2283
01:01:48,470 --> 01:01:50,900
Is that around the Rem
Shiny Happy People time?

2284
01:01:51,350 --> 01:01:52,180
Um,

2285
01:01:52,180 --> 01:01:52,521
no.

2286
01:01:52,521 --> 01:01:52,691
Our,

2287
01:01:52,691 --> 01:01:55,720
that was earlier than that shiny
happy Jihad was right around.

2288
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:57,140
It was after September 11th.

2289
01:01:57,141 --> 01:02:01,390
There was a couple of years later there's
the suicide bomber talk and I had all

2290
01:02:01,391 --> 01:02:06,391
this Islamic radical material about
them blowing themselves up per pussy and

2291
01:02:06,911 --> 01:02:07,780
another dimension.

2292
01:02:08,210 --> 01:02:09,700
It was a political comedian.

2293
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:10,890
Not really,

2294
01:02:10,890 --> 01:02:11,723
no,

2295
01:02:12,450 --> 01:02:13,480
not really political at all,

2296
01:02:13,660 --> 01:02:14,740
but I think it's a,

2297
01:02:14,770 --> 01:02:16,770
it's a bad hustle like to to,

2298
01:02:16,771 --> 01:02:17,380
to like,

2299
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:19,150
like I have friends that are Democrats.

2300
01:02:19,230 --> 01:02:20,041
They'll talk about like,

2301
01:02:20,041 --> 01:02:20,550
we,

2302
01:02:20,550 --> 01:02:21,121
they'll say like,

2303
01:02:21,121 --> 01:02:21,271
you know,

2304
01:02:21,271 --> 01:02:23,550
we got to win this election
because we w w what?

2305
01:02:23,551 --> 01:02:24,384
What is this?

2306
01:02:24,690 --> 01:02:26,010
What the fuck are you talking about?

2307
01:02:26,011 --> 01:02:27,240
What does this we shit white man,

2308
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:27,690
you know,

2309
01:02:27,690 --> 01:02:28,950
it doesn't make any sense to me.

2310
01:02:29,060 --> 01:02:29,240
Like,

2311
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:32,940
I think the p the politics in
this country are so corrupt.

2312
01:02:33,020 --> 01:02:33,930
It's so stupid.

2313
01:02:33,990 --> 01:02:35,340
It's so unfixable.

2314
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:35,561
Oh,

2315
01:02:35,561 --> 01:02:36,610
what about the uh,

2316
01:02:36,770 --> 01:02:37,180
oh,

2317
01:02:37,180 --> 01:02:40,890
you're going to claim
you have to play that.

2318
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:41,331
We'll wait.

2319
01:02:41,331 --> 01:02:42,070
We'll do it right now.

2320
01:02:42,070 --> 01:02:42,903
I don't believe in pilot.

2321
01:02:42,940 --> 01:02:44,680
I mean I don't believe
in Republican Democrat.

2322
01:02:44,681 --> 01:02:45,610
I made it seem silly.

2323
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:46,780
I would say that I,

2324
01:02:46,781 --> 01:02:49,490
I would rather vote for a female
criminal than a male criminal.

2325
01:02:49,491 --> 01:02:51,000
So I would probably vote for Hillary.

2326
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:51,400
Really?

2327
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:52,121
Was that it?

2328
01:02:52,121 --> 01:02:53,450
Just because I think that women,

2329
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:54,420
uh,

2330
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:55,780
I would like women have power.

2331
01:02:56,230 --> 01:02:57,063
Why is that?

2332
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:58,023
Why?

2333
01:02:58,570 --> 01:03:00,550
Because I'm a woman and I feel like,

2334
01:03:00,580 --> 01:03:00,851
you know,

2335
01:03:00,851 --> 01:03:02,410
we still can't get abortions.

2336
01:03:02,411 --> 01:03:05,140
Like all these new abortion
restrictions have just been introduced,

2337
01:03:05,530 --> 01:03:07,420
are brand new that are
in effect in November.

2338
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:11,620
And I just feel like this has already
been taken care of and the men are

2339
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:13,110
bringing it back up and it's,

2340
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:16,600
it's just a way to bringing that back
up to unfortunately really just thing.

2341
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:17,561
Yeah,

2342
01:03:17,561 --> 01:03:18,394
there's a lot of,

2343
01:03:18,460 --> 01:03:18,851
I mean,

2344
01:03:18,851 --> 01:03:21,190
you go to this pro choice child,

2345
01:03:21,670 --> 01:03:21,971
I mean,

2346
01:03:21,971 --> 01:03:23,440
I just don't even understand.

2347
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:24,430
Well now Spartan Munich.

2348
01:03:24,490 --> 01:03:24,761
Okay,

2349
01:03:24,761 --> 01:03:24,881
well,

2350
01:03:24,881 --> 01:03:25,211
whatever,

2351
01:03:25,211 --> 01:03:28,000
like the embryo is the
second the sperm hits me,

2352
01:03:28,001 --> 01:03:31,210
it's like I just don't understand how
that is a life that we need to worry

2353
01:03:31,211 --> 01:03:32,044
about.

2354
01:03:32,050 --> 01:03:32,321
Well,

2355
01:03:32,321 --> 01:03:32,591
no,

2356
01:03:32,591 --> 01:03:34,240
I may mean I completely agree with you.

2357
01:03:34,270 --> 01:03:35,650
It does not make any sense.

2358
01:03:35,950 --> 01:03:37,300
And it's in my body.

2359
01:03:37,540 --> 01:03:37,840
Yeah.

2360
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:41,260
So it's like if it was in a man's
body it would be totally different.

2361
01:03:41,380 --> 01:03:42,213
I think.

2362
01:03:42,380 --> 01:03:42,640
Yeah.

2363
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:43,520
I have a joke about that.

2364
01:03:44,050 --> 01:03:44,870
You,

2365
01:03:44,870 --> 01:03:45,703
me,

2366
01:03:46,210 --> 01:03:46,571
uh,

2367
01:03:46,571 --> 01:03:48,340
if babies came out of dude's Dicks,

2368
01:03:48,370 --> 01:03:51,130
there'd be four people on the planet and
abortion would be an APP on your phone.

2369
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:52,790
Right,

2370
01:03:52,790 --> 01:03:53,410
right.

2371
01:03:53,410 --> 01:03:54,430
Probably would be right.

2372
01:03:54,820 --> 01:03:56,770
I think that's political
without being like,

2373
01:03:56,771 --> 01:03:57,604
we don't really,

2374
01:03:57,780 --> 01:03:58,840
we republicans,

2375
01:03:58,841 --> 01:03:59,140
you know,

2376
01:03:59,140 --> 01:03:59,300
well,

2377
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:04,300
it's just the nature of what it
is is people worried about babies.

2378
01:04:04,871 --> 01:04:05,470
Right.

2379
01:04:05,470 --> 01:04:09,310
And then like worried about life and
worried about like the religious idea of

2380
01:04:09,311 --> 01:04:10,320
procreating and

2381
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:11,841
yeah.

2382
01:04:11,841 --> 01:04:13,820
But as soon as it comes out of our bodies,

2383
01:04:13,821 --> 01:04:16,910
they can like pay at minimum wage or take
away it's health insurance or send it

2384
01:04:16,911 --> 01:04:17,601
off to war.

2385
01:04:17,601 --> 01:04:19,820
It's like they just care
about it as an embryo.

2386
01:04:19,830 --> 01:04:20,171
It's,

2387
01:04:20,171 --> 01:04:21,350
it makes no sense.

2388
01:04:21,470 --> 01:04:25,040
And the fact that that women have to
wait 72 hours to have an abortion in

2389
01:04:25,041 --> 01:04:27,740
Oklahoma now and zero hours to buy a gun.

2390
01:04:27,741 --> 01:04:31,840
And the fact that like women have
to go to a across the state lines,

2391
01:04:31,900 --> 01:04:34,960
well there's a federal thing
for seven days for firearms.

2392
01:04:35,370 --> 01:04:35,870
All right,

2393
01:04:35,870 --> 01:04:36,820
can't just buy a gun.

2394
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:38,100
It was a federal Sunday.

2395
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:39,460
Seven days versus,

2396
01:04:39,540 --> 01:04:39,821
all right,

2397
01:04:39,821 --> 01:04:40,750
well that's actually longer,

2398
01:04:40,751 --> 01:04:43,440
but still I think there's a,

2399
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:47,590
there's a real problem with anybody
telling someone what they can and can't do

2400
01:04:47,591 --> 01:04:48,730
it with their body.

2401
01:04:48,850 --> 01:04:51,790
But there's also a real problem
when abortions get later.

2402
01:04:52,180 --> 01:04:54,250
Like when you're talking about
like late term abortions,

2403
01:04:54,251 --> 01:04:56,590
things get really weird when you're
talking about like four or five,

2404
01:04:56,591 --> 01:04:57,430
six months.

2405
01:04:57,490 --> 01:05:01,210
Like I know a woman who got
an abortion at six months.

2406
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:03,820
She had a chance to go
to like some secret.

2407
01:05:03,821 --> 01:05:04,520
It was in New York.

2408
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:05,230
She had a,

2409
01:05:05,230 --> 01:05:07,300
there's very few doctors
that were willing to do it.

2410
01:05:07,301 --> 01:05:09,450
Her and her boyfriend
were fighting over it.

2411
01:05:09,451 --> 01:05:11,020
They were poor and she was pregnant.

2412
01:05:11,021 --> 01:05:14,020
She wanted to keep the baby and I mean
it was like more than five months.

2413
01:05:14,190 --> 01:05:15,180
So she wanted to keep it.

2414
01:05:15,181 --> 01:05:15,780
He didn't.

2415
01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:16,530
Yeah,

2416
01:05:16,530 --> 01:05:19,630
but see the thing is giving
birth to a child like that,

2417
01:05:19,660 --> 01:05:21,220
in that circumstance,

2418
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:24,400
that is not the kind of child
that you're raising right now.

2419
01:05:24,510 --> 01:05:24,760
Right.

2420
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:29,050
Your kid is being infused with love and
attention and positivity and it's like

2421
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:29,550
they're,

2422
01:05:29,550 --> 01:05:32,350
they're already fighting
before the kid is like born.

2423
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:37,000
It's like that is not going to be
a positive environment and we're

2424
01:05:37,001 --> 01:05:38,040
overpopulated.

2425
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:38,391
No,

2426
01:05:38,391 --> 01:05:38,611
you,

2427
01:05:38,611 --> 01:05:39,830
you make some good points.

2428
01:05:40,130 --> 01:05:41,690
And I think the good point,

2429
01:05:41,691 --> 01:05:44,360
the counter to play devil's
advocate would be the,

2430
01:05:44,361 --> 01:05:46,700
or God's advocate would be that,

2431
01:05:46,701 --> 01:05:46,941
you know,

2432
01:05:46,941 --> 01:05:50,480
that kid could go to a happy family
that was looking to adopt and have a

2433
01:05:50,481 --> 01:05:51,314
wonderful life.

2434
01:05:51,350 --> 01:05:54,830
Maybe a wall or maybe it'll
end up addicted to drugs.

2435
01:05:54,831 --> 01:05:56,000
It's like it's not alive yet.

2436
01:05:56,180 --> 01:05:57,013
You're right.

2437
01:05:57,020 --> 01:05:58,220
Well it's just not,

2438
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:01,340
but it can exist outside the womb
and that's when things get weird.

2439
01:06:01,341 --> 01:06:02,750
Late term abortions are really weird.

2440
01:06:02,780 --> 01:06:03,613
But she got it.

2441
01:06:03,860 --> 01:06:04,061
Yes,

2442
01:06:04,061 --> 01:06:04,740
she did.

2443
01:06:04,740 --> 01:06:06,110
And she didn't want to get it.

2444
01:06:06,380 --> 01:06:06,591
No,

2445
01:06:06,591 --> 01:06:07,160
she didn't.

2446
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:07,400
No,

2447
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:07,761
she didn't.

2448
01:06:07,761 --> 01:06:10,490
They actually wound up having
kids after that is really weird.

2449
01:06:11,060 --> 01:06:12,110
And He loves his kids.

2450
01:06:12,111 --> 01:06:15,050
He didn't have kids before then
and then he loves his kids now.

2451
01:06:15,051 --> 01:06:16,040
It's very strange.

2452
01:06:16,460 --> 01:06:17,420
It's very dark.

2453
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:17,901
It's very,

2454
01:06:17,901 --> 01:06:18,410
it's,

2455
01:06:18,410 --> 01:06:21,680
but that is the gray area that is life.

2456
01:06:21,710 --> 01:06:21,981
You know,

2457
01:06:21,981 --> 01:06:23,120
life is weird.

2458
01:06:23,121 --> 01:06:25,310
It's not as simple cut and dry.

2459
01:06:25,311 --> 01:06:27,920
When people argue one side or the other,

2460
01:06:28,340 --> 01:06:29,173
you know,

2461
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:31,190
and especially if they ignore the,

2462
01:06:31,191 --> 01:06:34,370
the positives or the negatives
that the other side's presenting.

2463
01:06:34,910 --> 01:06:36,500
People love to have absolutes.

2464
01:06:36,501 --> 01:06:37,161
They love to have,

2465
01:06:37,161 --> 01:06:37,611
I'm right.

2466
01:06:37,611 --> 01:06:38,091
You're wrong.

2467
01:06:38,091 --> 01:06:38,631
They love to have,

2468
01:06:38,631 --> 01:06:39,590
this is the right way.

2469
01:06:39,591 --> 01:06:40,281
This is the wrong way.

2470
01:06:40,281 --> 01:06:41,114
This is what God wants.

2471
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:41,491
I mean,

2472
01:06:41,491 --> 01:06:43,200
I guess that's what I'm
saying that I'm right,

2473
01:06:43,201 --> 01:06:43,871
but like I,

2474
01:06:43,871 --> 01:06:48,030
I feel like I'm right in the sense that
it's up to people to choose what they

2475
01:06:48,031 --> 01:06:49,830
want to do with their
bodies and themselves.

2476
01:06:49,831 --> 01:06:52,080
And if they want to get on drugs or
if they want to have an abortion,

2477
01:06:52,081 --> 01:06:54,000
like don't make people raise children,

2478
01:06:54,330 --> 01:06:56,280
which is probably one of
the hardest things to do.

2479
01:06:56,310 --> 01:06:57,031
I've never done it,

2480
01:06:57,031 --> 01:07:00,660
but it must be so challenging
and you have money.

2481
01:07:00,690 --> 01:07:01,261
I have money.

2482
01:07:01,261 --> 01:07:02,820
Like imagine doing it with no money.

2483
01:07:02,821 --> 01:07:06,960
It just seems like to force someone to
do that and make it almost impossible for

2484
01:07:06,961 --> 01:07:10,860
them to get rid of there when a man has
been the one who like did it to them

2485
01:07:10,861 --> 01:07:11,341
anyway,

2486
01:07:11,341 --> 01:07:12,860
it just seems crazy to me.

2487
01:07:12,910 --> 01:07:13,301
Well,

2488
01:07:13,301 --> 01:07:14,230
they did it together.

2489
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:15,250
Hopefully.

2490
01:07:15,250 --> 01:07:15,551
No,

2491
01:07:15,551 --> 01:07:15,911
I know.

2492
01:07:15,911 --> 01:07:16,241
I know.

2493
01:07:16,241 --> 01:07:16,721
But anyway,

2494
01:07:16,721 --> 01:07:19,990
I would rather have a female in charge
because I feel right now if you do not

2495
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:22,210
believe that women are equal to men,

2496
01:07:22,211 --> 01:07:25,420
which a lot of a lot of these Middle
Eastern countries don't believe that.

2497
01:07:25,421 --> 01:07:26,254
It's like that is,

2498
01:07:26,340 --> 01:07:29,050
you're part of the problem
of keeping people back.

2499
01:07:29,530 --> 01:07:29,741
Well,

2500
01:07:29,741 --> 01:07:32,800
there's certainly should be a
quality when it comes to laws.

2501
01:07:32,801 --> 01:07:35,680
Initiative certainly should be a quality
when it comes to the way we treat each

2502
01:07:35,681 --> 01:07:36,460
other.

2503
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:40,270
But we also should accept the fact that
we're just fucking completely different,

2504
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:41,021
you know?

2505
01:07:41,021 --> 01:07:42,730
And just leave people alone.

2506
01:07:42,910 --> 01:07:44,410
Let them do whatever the
fuck they want to do.

2507
01:07:44,411 --> 01:07:49,411
And anybody that thinks that a woman
who's pregnant for 40 hours or you find

2508
01:07:50,201 --> 01:07:50,680
out,

2509
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:51,513
you know what I'm saying?

2510
01:07:51,660 --> 01:07:52,840
You just find out you're pregnant,

2511
01:07:53,350 --> 01:07:54,880
you've got pregnant two days ago,

2512
01:07:54,940 --> 01:07:56,710
and that you shouldn't
be able to stop that.

2513
01:07:56,740 --> 01:07:56,831
Oh,

2514
01:07:56,831 --> 01:07:57,371
what are you talking?

2515
01:07:57,371 --> 01:07:59,320
Are we talking about
like three cells take?

2516
01:07:59,321 --> 01:08:00,154
What are we talking about?

2517
01:08:00,310 --> 01:08:02,940
We're talking about a
cluster that fits in that.

2518
01:08:02,990 --> 01:08:04,600
The end of this stir mean,

2519
01:08:05,140 --> 01:08:05,460
I mean,

2520
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:05,980
well,

2521
01:08:05,980 --> 01:08:06,401
there's a lot,

2522
01:08:06,401 --> 01:08:06,941
I don't know.

2523
01:08:06,941 --> 01:08:08,230
Everyone's specific beliefs.

2524
01:08:08,231 --> 01:08:12,550
I just know that a lot of new restrictions
in the New York Times last Sunday,

2525
01:08:12,551 --> 01:08:15,530
they had a map full of
all the new restrictions.

2526
01:08:15,531 --> 01:08:20,180
And like now in five states you have
to wait 72 hours and 10 more states.

2527
01:08:20,181 --> 01:08:23,510
There's two followup visits that
before you can get the abortion.

2528
01:08:23,740 --> 01:08:25,340
So you have to start doing counseling.

2529
01:08:25,610 --> 01:08:25,851
You know,

2530
01:08:25,851 --> 01:08:28,370
you have to go drive two hours
to do counseling appointments.

2531
01:08:28,371 --> 01:08:29,330
It's like if you know,

2532
01:08:29,331 --> 01:08:30,170
you don't want the baby,

2533
01:08:30,171 --> 01:08:32,090
why do you have to go do counseling?

2534
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:32,953
It's just,

2535
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,290
I think they're looking at it,

2536
01:08:34,380 --> 01:08:36,870
and this is obviously it's gotta be,

2537
01:08:36,930 --> 01:08:39,240
there's gotta be a religious perspective.

2538
01:08:39,270 --> 01:08:39,470
Yeah,

2539
01:08:39,470 --> 01:08:39,810
right.

2540
01:08:39,810 --> 01:08:40,643
It has to be,

2541
01:08:40,650 --> 01:08:43,680
but I think they're looking at it
and not looking at it like a person.

2542
01:08:43,681 --> 01:08:45,150
Like you didn't looking at it,

2543
01:08:45,151 --> 01:08:49,620
a person that is lost and confused and
they're going to give them guidance and

2544
01:08:49,621 --> 01:08:50,221
that's all the way.

2545
01:08:50,221 --> 01:08:53,010
A lot of like really
fundamental religious people,

2546
01:08:53,130 --> 01:08:54,210
especially Christians.

2547
01:08:54,211 --> 01:08:55,930
And that's the way a
lot of people feel like,

2548
01:08:55,960 --> 01:09:00,180
like this person just needs to be taken
in and we just take them into the Lord's

2549
01:09:00,181 --> 01:09:03,450
arms and show them what
they're doing is wrong.

2550
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:05,230
You have a baby inside your body,

2551
01:09:05,260 --> 01:09:06,061
smells precious,

2552
01:09:06,061 --> 01:09:10,450
gift kill you and you were
just killing baby Kale.

2553
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:11,793
What if you,

2554
01:09:11,860 --> 01:09:13,810
what if you went around to
everyone you saw and you were like,

2555
01:09:13,811 --> 01:09:14,680
you gotta smoke pot.

2556
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:15,830
You got to do Jujitsu,

2557
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:16,781
you got to do everything.

2558
01:09:16,781 --> 01:09:17,051
I do.

2559
01:09:17,051 --> 01:09:17,561
Just do it.

2560
01:09:17,561 --> 01:09:18,320
It'll make you feel better.

2561
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:18,670
Do it,

2562
01:09:18,670 --> 01:09:19,503
do it.

2563
01:09:23,490 --> 01:09:28,130
You don't stand outside sports
locker or 14 million people a month,

2564
01:09:28,150 --> 01:09:31,440
but you don't like passionately feel
that everyone has to do what you know.

2565
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:33,713
It's like it doesn't,

2566
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,050
it's like do it for you.

2567
01:09:35,051 --> 01:09:35,620
But this the,

2568
01:09:35,620 --> 01:09:36,070
yeah.

2569
01:09:36,070 --> 01:09:39,430
Well I'm a big believer in let people
do whatever the fuck they want to do as

2570
01:09:39,431 --> 01:09:40,870
long as it doesn't hurt anybody else.

2571
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:42,250
And I think you are too.

2572
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:46,480
And I think that the real problem that
people have with abortion as they think

2573
01:09:46,481 --> 01:09:48,010
that there's another person involved,

2574
01:09:48,011 --> 01:09:49,810
and it's not as simple as like,

2575
01:09:49,811 --> 01:09:53,860
I should be able to smoke pot or I
should be able to that think who's,

2576
01:09:53,890 --> 01:09:55,690
who's standing up for that
little baby inside of you?

2577
01:09:55,730 --> 01:09:57,880
That's why do these people
care about people so much?

2578
01:09:57,881 --> 01:09:59,090
It's like that's where it gets weird.

2579
01:09:59,190 --> 01:10:04,190
That's compassion for a cluster of cells
that can fit on a fucking coffee star,

2580
01:10:04,350 --> 01:10:05,910
but you don't give a fuck about war

2581
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:07,010
war or,

2582
01:10:07,020 --> 01:10:07,321
or,

2583
01:10:07,321 --> 01:10:10,200
or the minimum wage or making sure that,

2584
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:12,270
that kids get great education.

2585
01:10:12,271 --> 01:10:15,930
It's are these people just like donating
all their time and money to help living

2586
01:10:15,931 --> 01:10:16,430
people?

2587
01:10:16,430 --> 01:10:16,871
It's,

2588
01:10:16,871 --> 01:10:17,060
it's,

2589
01:10:17,060 --> 01:10:17,910
it's so stupid

2590
01:10:17,930 --> 01:10:18,240
bid.

2591
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:20,590
How many of these people
that are anti abortion,

2592
01:10:20,670 --> 01:10:21,420
uh,

2593
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:22,500
are pro,

2594
01:10:22,501 --> 01:10:24,690
let's go to Baltimore
and clean up the city.

2595
01:10:24,810 --> 01:10:25,890
Exactly.

2596
01:10:26,370 --> 01:10:29,820
Let's help these people that are in like
really low income environments that are

2597
01:10:29,821 --> 01:10:32,070
filled with crime and
let's give them a way out.

2598
01:10:32,150 --> 01:10:32,661
Yeah.

2599
01:10:32,661 --> 01:10:32,961
It's like,

2600
01:10:32,961 --> 01:10:33,081
oh,

2601
01:10:33,081 --> 01:10:35,120
these people have such overactive empathy.

2602
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:35,631
They just,

2603
01:10:35,631 --> 01:10:36,860
they just want to help everything.

2604
01:10:36,861 --> 01:10:40,460
Even the clusters of cells that are
living inside of poor strangers bodies.

2605
01:10:40,930 --> 01:10:41,270
It's,

2606
01:10:41,270 --> 01:10:41,631
it's,

2607
01:10:41,631 --> 01:10:45,740
it's such a stupid way to
direct their religious fervor.

2608
01:10:45,770 --> 01:10:45,980
But

2609
01:10:45,980 --> 01:10:48,830
isn't it fascinating because isn't
that part of what a person is?

2610
01:10:48,860 --> 01:10:53,860
We're just a bundle of contradictions
where it's so hard to be objective and

2611
01:10:54,651 --> 01:10:59,450
logical about every single aspect of
your life and that people will sometimes

2612
01:10:59,451 --> 01:11:04,451
think that they're doing good and at the
same time promote shit that's terrible

2613
01:11:04,491 --> 01:11:05,324
and awful.

2614
01:11:05,340 --> 01:11:05,531
You know,

2615
01:11:05,531 --> 01:11:07,100
there's a lot of people that are like,

2616
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:12,280
I'm sure that we're like prolife an anti
abortion that didn't give a fuck about

2617
01:11:13,201 --> 01:11:14,820
that guy that got shot in Ferguson.

2618
01:11:15,090 --> 01:11:15,320
They'd,

2619
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:15,690
right.

2620
01:11:15,690 --> 01:11:16,051
You know,

2621
01:11:16,051 --> 01:11:16,440
there's,

2622
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:19,680
there's a lot of people that think
that you should execute prisoners,

2623
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:20,161
you know,

2624
01:11:20,161 --> 01:11:22,260
for a variety of different things.

2625
01:11:22,261 --> 01:11:24,180
They believe in the three strikes law.

2626
01:11:24,410 --> 01:11:27,840
You know how easy it would be to commit
three felonies if you lived in Compton.

2627
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:28,351
You know,

2628
01:11:28,351 --> 01:11:32,640
if you're born in Englewood
to a fat family filled with
violence and you want to

2629
01:11:32,641 --> 01:11:35,310
lock that person up for the rest of
their life by the time you're 18 because

2630
01:11:35,311 --> 01:11:36,540
they already have three felonies.

2631
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:37,051
Yeah.

2632
01:11:37,051 --> 01:11:38,460
They didn't get the opportunities.

2633
01:11:38,510 --> 01:11:39,270
Oh,

2634
01:11:39,270 --> 01:11:40,250
that is so fucked up.

2635
01:11:40,251 --> 01:11:43,860
But I would love to see a
pro life movement that just
started like really trying

2636
01:11:43,861 --> 01:11:47,820
to help re lives that are
already like a functioning,

2637
01:11:48,270 --> 01:11:50,310
why not that be the pro life movement?

2638
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:50,481
Yeah.

2639
01:11:50,481 --> 01:11:51,210
The real pro life.

2640
01:11:51,210 --> 01:11:54,060
Unborn babies in people
who don't want them.

2641
01:11:54,550 --> 01:11:55,800
Them's stomachs.

2642
01:11:56,010 --> 01:11:57,960
Doms yeah.

2643
01:11:57,961 --> 01:11:58,860
The real pro life

2644
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:01,210
movement is like helping
the lives that are,

2645
01:12:01,211 --> 01:12:05,380
they're not turn into a murderers
are not turn to a disaster.

2646
01:12:06,130 --> 01:12:06,431
Yeah.

2647
01:12:06,431 --> 01:12:08,830
I mean we're fucked up.

2648
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:10,930
Are All these republicans
that are running,

2649
01:12:10,931 --> 01:12:13,590
do they all believe in abortion
or they all believe that there's

2650
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:15,180
Beano can't get through.

2651
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:17,070
You can't get through
unless you're pro life.

2652
01:12:17,220 --> 01:12:17,920
There's no,

2653
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:18,753
Oh really?

2654
01:12:18,950 --> 01:12:20,060
You can't get through the maze.

2655
01:12:20,270 --> 01:12:24,560
I've never even heard of of a successful
up republican that gets to the end of

2656
01:12:24,561 --> 01:12:25,300
the line.

2657
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:27,050
Really the backing and
the religious right.

2658
01:12:27,051 --> 01:12:29,570
I mean there might be one that
people could prove me wrong,

2659
01:12:29,571 --> 01:12:30,320
but that's pretty much it.

2660
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:31,880
Like Arnold Schwarzenegger or something.

2661
01:12:31,881 --> 01:12:33,200
But they'll probably like lip lip,

2662
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:34,030
libertarian,

2663
01:12:34,030 --> 01:12:34,610
libertarian.

2664
01:12:34,610 --> 01:12:34,960
Yeah.

2665
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:36,370
There's a probably a few rare,

2666
01:12:36,371 --> 01:12:39,790
like maybe a that Rand Paul
Guy believes in pro choice.

2667
01:12:39,791 --> 01:12:41,140
But yeah,

2668
01:12:41,141 --> 01:12:41,360
it's,

2669
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:42,700
it's a religious thing for a lot.

2670
01:12:42,701 --> 01:12:43,221
I mean it's,

2671
01:12:43,221 --> 01:12:43,450
it,

2672
01:12:43,450 --> 01:12:44,620
it happened with Reagan.

2673
01:12:44,650 --> 01:12:45,460
I mean that's really,

2674
01:12:45,460 --> 01:12:47,770
Reagan was the first Republican to court.

2675
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:51,940
Those like really radical religious
people because they realize back then that

2676
01:12:51,970 --> 01:12:54,040
there's a lot of power in that movement.

2677
01:12:54,310 --> 01:12:57,790
The political power that you get from
having the Christian right on your side.

2678
01:12:58,240 --> 01:12:58,511
You know,

2679
01:12:58,511 --> 01:13:02,680
there's so much does the organizing
and the song so much power behind that.

2680
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:04,000
People that are just like,

2681
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:05,080
I don't give a fuck.

2682
01:13:05,110 --> 01:13:06,580
Those people don't organize.

2683
01:13:06,581 --> 01:13:07,810
Those people don't get together.

2684
01:13:07,990 --> 01:13:09,670
The people that don't
like leave people alone,

2685
01:13:09,671 --> 01:13:11,050
let them do whatever the
fuck they want to do.

2686
01:13:11,530 --> 01:13:13,410
A lot of those folks don't have the,

2687
01:13:13,411 --> 01:13:18,370
the drive to get off the couch and go
out and organize and make sure that their

2688
01:13:18,371 --> 01:13:21,670
views are expressed
evenly across the board.

2689
01:13:21,671 --> 01:13:23,290
But like Pete,

2690
01:13:23,291 --> 01:13:26,290
when people get really religious and
they think that God's involved and their

2691
01:13:26,291 --> 01:13:27,124
choices,

2692
01:13:27,220 --> 01:13:28,660
there's a lot of people that,

2693
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:30,270
especially Christianity,

2694
01:13:30,271 --> 01:13:34,230
there is this recruiting aspect to that
religion that you don't see in Buddhism.

2695
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:35,700
You don't see in Judaism,

2696
01:13:36,040 --> 01:13:40,320
you don't see really anywhere
but Christianity or maybe
you'd see it in some of

2697
01:13:40,321 --> 01:13:41,430
the Middle Eastern religions.

2698
01:13:41,431 --> 01:13:41,870
I don't know.

2699
01:13:41,870 --> 01:13:42,031
Oh,

2700
01:13:42,031 --> 01:13:43,380
Islam doesn't recruit,

2701
01:13:43,381 --> 01:13:43,751
but they,

2702
01:13:43,751 --> 01:13:45,330
they promote the fact that there's,

2703
01:13:45,331 --> 01:13:46,530
they're the perfect religion.

2704
01:13:46,531 --> 01:13:47,520
They let people join,

2705
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:49,700
but Judaism's fucking hard to join.

2706
01:13:49,870 --> 01:13:51,580
I know you kind of like ask three times,

2707
01:13:51,581 --> 01:13:52,450
you've got to like take like

2708
01:13:53,150 --> 01:13:53,983
my uncle did it.

2709
01:13:54,140 --> 01:13:54,530
Yeah.

2710
01:13:54,530 --> 01:13:54,711
Yeah.

2711
01:13:54,711 --> 01:13:57,230
My uncle married a Jewish woman and
he had to go through the whole deal.

2712
01:13:57,231 --> 01:14:00,320
He had to go to Hebrew school and the
whole animals like why are you doing man?

2713
01:14:00,810 --> 01:14:02,220
I liked Judaism.

2714
01:14:02,670 --> 01:14:03,360
Why?

2715
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:04,110
Because it's more,

2716
01:14:04,110 --> 01:14:08,010
well I was raised Catholic and Judaism
is more open to like intellectual

2717
01:14:08,011 --> 01:14:12,190
discourse and asking questions and having
the questions thought about and talked

2718
01:14:12,191 --> 01:14:16,690
about and where it's not as like absolute
is like Adam and eve go sit in the

2719
01:14:16,691 --> 01:14:17,230
hall.

2720
01:14:17,230 --> 01:14:21,460
Like I was always just putting the hallway
for asking questions and this is how

2721
01:14:21,461 --> 01:14:21,911
it is.

2722
01:14:21,911 --> 01:14:22,241
And it's like,

2723
01:14:22,241 --> 01:14:23,440
how could that be how it is?

2724
01:14:23,441 --> 01:14:24,610
And then you just get in trouble.

2725
01:14:25,330 --> 01:14:25,661
Yeah.

2726
01:14:25,661 --> 01:14:28,120
But does it doesn't have to be a religion.

2727
01:14:28,210 --> 01:14:28,560
I mean,

2728
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:29,800
isn't open discourse,

2729
01:14:29,801 --> 01:14:33,380
isn't that just part of being a curious
human being who's intelligent and I was,

2730
01:14:33,390 --> 01:14:34,960
doesn't have to be
attached to an ideology?

2731
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:35,431
Well,

2732
01:14:35,431 --> 01:14:38,790
I think that the ideologies can
teach you things like tradition and,

2733
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:39,721
and uh,

2734
01:14:39,721 --> 01:14:39,961
you know,

2735
01:14:39,961 --> 01:14:42,600
there's beautiful things
and probably all religions.

2736
01:14:42,601 --> 01:14:46,620
And I think that the future will be not
just like picking a religion and I'm the

2737
01:14:46,621 --> 01:14:49,830
religion that my dad was and
I'm the job that my dad was,

2738
01:14:49,831 --> 01:14:50,880
my dad was a cobbler,

2739
01:14:50,881 --> 01:14:51,760
Swami McCall blur.

2740
01:14:51,780 --> 01:14:53,100
My parents were Catholic,

2741
01:14:53,101 --> 01:14:54,090
so I'm a Catholic.

2742
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:55,500
It's such an outmoded,

2743
01:14:55,530 --> 01:14:56,820
it's so outdated.

2744
01:14:56,980 --> 01:14:59,460
I think as an adult you use sample,

2745
01:14:59,461 --> 01:15:00,930
lots of religions and you,

2746
01:15:01,020 --> 01:15:04,350
you learn about as many as you can and
you form your own philosophies and pull

2747
01:15:04,351 --> 01:15:06,120
from there there for us to pull from,

2748
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:06,631
you know,

2749
01:15:06,631 --> 01:15:06,811
they're,

2750
01:15:06,811 --> 01:15:08,730
they're all windows onto the same thing.

2751
01:15:08,731 --> 01:15:10,180
So it's like why not learn?

2752
01:15:10,230 --> 01:15:10,681
I mean I,

2753
01:15:10,681 --> 01:15:11,070
I'm,

2754
01:15:11,070 --> 01:15:12,660
I want to learn more about Judaism.

2755
01:15:12,661 --> 01:15:13,471
I'm dating a Jew,

2756
01:15:13,471 --> 01:15:14,940
I want to learn more about Buddhism.

2757
01:15:14,941 --> 01:15:16,950
I meditate and do Buddhist chants.

2758
01:15:16,951 --> 01:15:21,690
Like I love it all and I think it's like
definitely a positive thing for your

2759
01:15:21,691 --> 01:15:22,360
life.

2760
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:26,620
I definitely think that looking into
the ancient traditions and philosophies,

2761
01:15:26,621 --> 01:15:28,190
there's the definitely
something to be learned from it.

2762
01:15:28,330 --> 01:15:32,020
What I have a problem with is attaching
yourself to any rigid ideology.

2763
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:32,560
Yes.

2764
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:33,670
I grew up Catholic too.

2765
01:15:33,850 --> 01:15:35,380
And for a very short period of time,

2766
01:15:35,381 --> 01:15:36,460
my parents like didn't,

2767
01:15:36,730 --> 01:15:38,650
they stopped me from doing
it when I was in first grade.

2768
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:39,513
Oh really?

2769
01:15:39,550 --> 01:15:40,390
While I was in first grade,

2770
01:15:40,391 --> 01:15:41,560
I told them I would run away from home.

2771
01:15:41,561 --> 01:15:41,861
I'm like,

2772
01:15:41,861 --> 01:15:43,270
you send me back to the shit I'm going to,

2773
01:15:43,550 --> 01:15:44,383
I'm not doing that.

2774
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,090
We're lapsed Catholic.

2775
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:46,953
Oh so bad.

2776
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:48,110
It was just rough.

2777
01:15:48,190 --> 01:15:50,410
I W but before that my
parents were getting divorced.

2778
01:15:50,620 --> 01:15:52,480
So before first grade I was like,

2779
01:15:52,481 --> 01:15:54,790
I was thinking that God was
like the answer to all of this.

2780
01:15:54,791 --> 01:15:57,520
Cause I was like really scared
and confused and you know,

2781
01:15:57,530 --> 01:15:59,230
there's like so much turmoil going on.

2782
01:15:59,231 --> 01:16:00,880
I really thought that
like that was the answer.

2783
01:16:00,881 --> 01:16:03,130
Like religion was the answer and uh,

2784
01:16:03,190 --> 01:16:04,180
cause I was just terrified.

2785
01:16:04,450 --> 01:16:07,150
But then going to Catholic
school cured me of that shit.

2786
01:16:07,570 --> 01:16:08,220
Oh,

2787
01:16:08,220 --> 01:16:10,140
there were so rude and mean

2788
01:16:11,580 --> 01:16:13,180
I had none and grabbed me.

2789
01:16:13,510 --> 01:16:13,961
I was,

2790
01:16:13,961 --> 01:16:14,231
you know,

2791
01:16:14,231 --> 01:16:14,950
what are you doing?

2792
01:16:14,950 --> 01:16:16,000
You think you're so cute.

2793
01:16:16,001 --> 01:16:16,990
Take those socks off.

2794
01:16:16,991 --> 01:16:18,690
Like anytime I try to like it,

2795
01:16:18,691 --> 01:16:20,650
like be individual.

2796
01:16:20,950 --> 01:16:22,690
Anytime I'd ask a question.

2797
01:16:22,990 --> 01:16:24,070
They were assholes.

2798
01:16:24,130 --> 01:16:25,360
God doesn't like your socks.

2799
01:16:27,730 --> 01:16:28,563
Yeah,

2800
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:29,261
that's a dark.

2801
01:16:29,261 --> 01:16:30,490
Religion is a,

2802
01:16:30,491 --> 01:16:32,020
it's a very depressing religion,

2803
01:16:32,260 --> 01:16:33,093
you know?

2804
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:36,680
Although I did go to the Vatican when
I was in Rome last week and I did

2805
01:16:36,681 --> 01:16:37,514
communion,

2806
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:37,701
no,

2807
01:16:37,701 --> 01:16:39,500
not communion confession,

2808
01:16:39,660 --> 01:16:40,220
because they,

2809
01:16:40,220 --> 01:16:41,150
it was like through the rope.

2810
01:16:41,151 --> 01:16:41,421
They're like,

2811
01:16:41,421 --> 01:16:42,350
do you want to do confession?

2812
01:16:42,351 --> 01:16:42,830
I was like,

2813
01:16:42,830 --> 01:16:43,100
oh,

2814
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:43,281
well,

2815
01:16:43,281 --> 01:16:43,611
yeah,

2816
01:16:43,611 --> 01:16:44,540
I'm at the Vatican.

2817
01:16:44,570 --> 01:16:45,403
What'd you talk about?

2818
01:16:45,410 --> 01:16:45,711
Well,

2819
01:16:45,711 --> 01:16:48,590
I just sat down and he asked
me if I believed in Jesus.

2820
01:16:48,591 --> 01:16:49,730
And I was like,

2821
01:16:49,790 --> 01:16:50,091
oh no.

2822
01:16:50,091 --> 01:16:50,691
First he goes,

2823
01:16:50,691 --> 01:16:52,070
have you ever made abortion?

2824
01:16:53,030 --> 01:16:54,110
Oh,

2825
01:16:54,140 --> 01:16:55,730
that's the first thing he asked you.

2826
01:16:56,180 --> 01:16:56,451
He goes,

2827
01:16:56,451 --> 01:16:57,320
do you have any sense?

2828
01:16:57,620 --> 01:16:58,221
And I was like,

2829
01:16:58,221 --> 01:16:58,970
well,

2830
01:16:58,970 --> 01:16:59,661
what did I say?

2831
01:16:59,661 --> 01:17:00,360
I was like,

2832
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:00,770
Oh,

2833
01:17:00,770 --> 01:17:00,930
oh,

2834
01:17:00,930 --> 01:17:01,040
I,

2835
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:01,560
I told him,

2836
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:01,941
I was like,

2837
01:17:01,941 --> 01:17:02,631
not really,

2838
01:17:02,631 --> 01:17:02,911
you know,

2839
01:17:02,911 --> 01:17:03,410
um,

2840
01:17:03,410 --> 01:17:06,290
I don't really believe in this
religion or something like that.

2841
01:17:06,291 --> 01:17:06,621
And he's like,

2842
01:17:06,621 --> 01:17:07,670
have you ever made abortion?

2843
01:17:07,671 --> 01:17:08,241
And I was like,

2844
01:17:08,241 --> 01:17:08,900
no.

2845
01:17:08,900 --> 01:17:09,550
And he's like,

2846
01:17:09,550 --> 01:17:10,070
and I,

2847
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:10,461
and I said,

2848
01:17:10,461 --> 01:17:10,581
well,

2849
01:17:10,581 --> 01:17:14,210
I do smoke pot and it helps
me with my creativity.

2850
01:17:14,780 --> 01:17:15,800
And he was like,

2851
01:17:15,830 --> 01:17:16,071
I go,

2852
01:17:16,071 --> 01:17:16,641
is that bad?

2853
01:17:16,641 --> 01:17:17,770
He's like against say,

2854
01:17:17,780 --> 01:17:18,291
I don't know,

2855
01:17:18,291 --> 01:17:20,510
like he was kind of seeing
more Jewish actually.

2856
01:17:21,980 --> 01:17:22,880
And then I told him I was,

2857
01:17:22,881 --> 01:17:24,950
I was going to get married
to a Jew and he's like,

2858
01:17:24,951 --> 01:17:25,970
what can you do?

2859
01:17:26,420 --> 01:17:27,253
And then he's,

2860
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:28,970
it was pretty cool.

2861
01:17:28,971 --> 01:17:29,631
And then he was like,

2862
01:17:29,631 --> 01:17:30,320
can you go to,

2863
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:31,820
can you go to mass once a year?

2864
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:32,541
He's like,

2865
01:17:32,541 --> 01:17:33,140
I'm sure that,

2866
01:17:33,140 --> 01:17:34,760
and then you go to temple once a year.

2867
01:17:34,850 --> 01:17:35,660
He's like,

2868
01:17:35,660 --> 01:17:35,961
he goes,

2869
01:17:35,961 --> 01:17:36,411
what did he say?

2870
01:17:36,411 --> 01:17:37,100
He was like,

2871
01:17:37,100 --> 01:17:38,300
I think you can handle that.

2872
01:17:38,470 --> 01:17:39,011
Wow.

2873
01:17:39,011 --> 01:17:40,120
Sounds pretty progressive.

2874
01:17:40,121 --> 01:17:42,280
But I think they're trying
to be more like that.

2875
01:17:42,340 --> 01:17:42,730
You know,

2876
01:17:42,730 --> 01:17:44,020
this is coming from the Vatican.

2877
01:17:44,050 --> 01:17:44,560
Right.

2878
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:47,030
And I think that that
was definitely an offset.

2879
01:17:47,180 --> 01:17:48,760
An offshoot of that new pope.

2880
01:17:49,090 --> 01:17:49,570
He's,

2881
01:17:49,570 --> 01:17:50,291
he's dope.

2882
01:17:50,291 --> 01:17:51,124
That new pope.

2883
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:52,660
I mean I'm not a fan of popes,

2884
01:17:52,661 --> 01:17:55,600
but that guy is like the way
he speaks about gay people,

2885
01:17:55,601 --> 01:17:58,060
the way he abandoned
the giant throne love.

2886
01:17:58,061 --> 01:18:00,190
And I was Kinda like a regular
chair that he sits down.

2887
01:18:00,220 --> 01:18:01,660
He doesn't live in their apartment either.

2888
01:18:01,661 --> 01:18:03,790
They have like a gold plated
apartment or something.

2889
01:18:04,390 --> 01:18:05,230
He got rid of the pope.

2890
01:18:05,231 --> 01:18:06,064
Tmobile too.

2891
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:07,540
He's like a second to shoot me.

2892
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:08,620
They're going to fucking shoot me.

2893
01:18:08,740 --> 01:18:09,440
Oh Wow.

2894
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:09,940
Yeah.

2895
01:18:09,940 --> 01:18:11,080
Everything I read about him,

2896
01:18:11,081 --> 01:18:12,130
I'm so inspired.

2897
01:18:12,310 --> 01:18:14,370
Bulletproof pope mobile might

2898
01:18:19,930 --> 01:18:20,500
shoot me,

2899
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:21,790
but don't shoot me now bitch.

2900
01:18:21,791 --> 01:18:22,624
I got shit to do.

2901
01:18:24,350 --> 01:18:26,620
I read that thing was so crazy.

2902
01:18:26,620 --> 01:18:28,180
This fucking aquarium,

2903
01:18:28,190 --> 01:18:29,160
you're driving this paper.

2904
01:18:29,830 --> 01:18:30,670
I have to look this up.

2905
01:18:30,710 --> 01:18:31,610
I've never seen the pope Moby.

2906
01:18:31,780 --> 01:18:33,340
Oh my God.

2907
01:18:33,390 --> 01:18:33,860
Oh,

2908
01:18:33,860 --> 01:18:35,100
this is what they told me
when I was enrolled in.

2909
01:18:35,110 --> 01:18:35,943
They're like,

2910
01:18:36,070 --> 01:18:37,900
oh my God,

2911
01:18:37,990 --> 01:18:39,910
that is a bulletproof Mercedes.

2912
01:18:41,190 --> 01:18:42,023
Funny.

2913
01:18:42,180 --> 01:18:43,780
The pope a driver on that thing,

2914
01:18:43,781 --> 01:18:45,190
so he didn't get JFK aid.

2915
01:18:45,430 --> 01:18:45,611
Well,

2916
01:18:45,611 --> 01:18:50,611
they told me when I was in cope
is doing a waving at 11 o'clock

2917
01:18:58,130 --> 01:18:59,140
never heard of that before.

2918
01:18:59,141 --> 01:19:04,141
I got to get a photo shoot and one of
those things drive around my hometown and

2919
01:19:04,241 --> 01:19:05,130
do a waving.

2920
01:19:05,140 --> 01:19:07,450
I could see you in there for
like Vanity Fair magazine

2921
01:19:09,180 --> 01:19:10,390
driven around La.

2922
01:19:20,680 --> 01:19:21,850
Oh my goodness.

2923
01:19:22,370 --> 01:19:22,930
God,

2924
01:19:22,930 --> 01:19:23,741
there's more than one.

2925
01:19:23,741 --> 01:19:24,491
I guess they've,

2926
01:19:24,491 --> 01:19:26,260
they've made a few of them over the years.

2927
01:19:27,450 --> 01:19:32,030
Always be Mercedes only
the best for pontiff.

2928
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:34,233
Okay,

2929
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:38,590
this is take America back from
Rick Santorum released today.

2930
01:19:40,410 --> 01:19:42,190
This is by the way,

2931
01:19:42,940 --> 01:19:46,120
this is just the beginning of
this wave of fucking stupid.

2932
01:19:48,070 --> 01:19:52,600
It's thinly veiled racism in a lot
of ways because it's taking it back,

2933
01:19:52,601 --> 01:19:54,750
taking America back in.

2934
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:57,790
We'll take America back from
these liberals and there's Obama,

2935
01:19:58,060 --> 01:20:03,060
Barack Obama saying in a way they didn't
say when Clinton was in office when

2936
01:20:04,541 --> 01:20:05,374
they were trying to,

2937
01:20:06,150 --> 01:20:08,580
they were trying to elect
a Republican Post Clinton.

2938
01:20:08,730 --> 01:20:12,180
They didn't have this sort of
take it back sort of mentality.

2939
01:20:12,570 --> 01:20:13,200
This isn't,

2940
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:14,040
and this is weird,

2941
01:20:14,380 --> 01:20:15,213
it will play this

2942
01:20:29,430 --> 01:20:30,263
unleash

2943
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:38,190
the fried like the prides of pit bull.

2944
01:20:40,070 --> 01:20:41,600
This is him singing.

2945
01:20:41,750 --> 01:20:42,583
Yes.

2946
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:43,940
I have to think so.

2947
01:20:52,820 --> 01:20:54,170
Oh my God.

2948
01:20:54,430 --> 01:20:55,570
These lyrics that we're not hearing,

2949
01:20:55,571 --> 01:20:59,140
it's like this is for the man work
in the factory making drive train.

2950
01:20:59,141 --> 01:21:02,440
This is for the farmer work in the
wheat fields grow in the long grain.

2951
01:21:02,980 --> 01:21:04,440
Seems like they're pandering.

2952
01:21:04,820 --> 01:21:06,430
It's just like when you get those ads,

2953
01:21:06,431 --> 01:21:09,700
like you start looking up a hotel and
then like Google starts giving you those

2954
01:21:09,701 --> 01:21:10,750
ads constantly.

2955
01:21:10,751 --> 01:21:13,450
It's like they've just done a
demographic search and they're like,

2956
01:21:13,451 --> 01:21:17,070
these are the only hope for these people
who are farmers and garbage drove a

2957
01:21:17,170 --> 01:21:18,460
garbage truck.

2958
01:21:18,461 --> 01:21:20,500
Drivers and like whoever that.

2959
01:21:20,530 --> 01:21:20,771
Yeah,

2960
01:21:20,771 --> 01:21:21,581
the laborers,

2961
01:21:21,581 --> 01:21:21,851
they're like,

2962
01:21:21,851 --> 01:21:24,010
this is no smart person will vote for us.

2963
01:21:24,011 --> 01:21:28,870
So we must hander in the in
the stupidest possible way.

2964
01:21:28,990 --> 01:21:30,490
This is for the preachers,

2965
01:21:30,491 --> 01:21:31,151
the teachers.

2966
01:21:31,151 --> 01:21:31,810
Here we go,

2967
01:21:31,810 --> 01:21:34,270
the blue collar warriors,

2968
01:21:34,360 --> 01:21:35,193
warriors,

2969
01:21:35,260 --> 01:21:37,170
they're blue collar and they're warrior.

2970
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:37,730
I says,

2971
01:21:37,730 --> 01:21:38,600
not for the teachers.

2972
01:21:38,601 --> 01:21:40,580
Anyone who's gone to
college would not vote.

2973
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:44,570
This is for believers whose
dreams are on the line.

2974
01:21:44,690 --> 01:21:45,590
Oh my God.

2975
01:21:45,710 --> 01:21:49,190
Now is this Santorum
actually singing Hampi.

2976
01:21:50,090 --> 01:21:50,830
Okay.

2977
01:21:50,830 --> 01:21:51,200
Boom.

2978
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:52,040
Gun toting,

2979
01:21:52,041 --> 01:21:53,210
prolife homophobic,

2980
01:21:53,211 --> 01:21:56,450
former United States senator
will reportedly announced
his run for presidency

2981
01:21:56,451 --> 01:22:00,800
today after being edged out by Mitt Romney
in 2012 Rick Santorum is throwing his

2982
01:22:00,801 --> 01:22:01,461
hat in the ring.

2983
01:22:01,461 --> 01:22:02,294
Once again,

2984
01:22:02,540 --> 01:22:04,250
this time the campaign is on point.

2985
01:22:04,251 --> 01:22:08,060
Judging by this official Santorum
for president campaign song.

2986
01:22:08,090 --> 01:22:08,391
Okay.

2987
01:22:08,391 --> 01:22:10,010
Might not be his song.

2988
01:22:10,110 --> 01:22:10,800
Hello.

2989
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:12,410
Find out the idea that well,

2990
01:22:12,440 --> 01:22:16,470
so the idea that there's like a Bush and
Clinton running again too is so insane.

2991
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:17,430
It's mind boggling.

2992
01:22:17,460 --> 01:22:17,701
I mean,

2993
01:22:17,701 --> 01:22:19,410
I can't even believe it's a dynasty.

2994
01:22:19,970 --> 01:22:20,190
Their,

2995
01:22:20,190 --> 01:22:20,491
their,

2996
01:22:20,491 --> 01:22:22,230
their royalty that we don't,

2997
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:23,041
we haven't figured,

2998
01:22:23,041 --> 01:22:25,060
I mean it's Kinda good that
there's other people trying,

2999
01:22:25,110 --> 01:22:25,320
well,

3000
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:28,620
we tried with Obama had didn't
work out so good did it.

3001
01:22:29,460 --> 01:22:30,510
I don't even know if it did.

3002
01:22:30,540 --> 01:22:32,340
Nobody is a good fucking president.

3003
01:22:32,341 --> 01:22:34,890
There's no one has ever done
it where everybody loved them.

3004
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:37,680
Not a single one ever because
the ambition involved,

3005
01:22:37,681 --> 01:22:39,480
it just excludes anyone.

3006
01:22:39,490 --> 01:22:40,323
Cool.

3007
01:22:41,270 --> 01:22:42,130
Especially today.

3008
01:22:42,131 --> 01:22:42,240
Right?

3009
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:43,110
With the intrusion,

3010
01:22:43,470 --> 01:22:44,770
the amount of privacy,

3011
01:22:44,910 --> 01:22:48,450
the investigation into
your past and scrutiny.

3012
01:22:48,950 --> 01:22:49,290
I mean,

3013
01:22:49,290 --> 01:22:50,490
you can't be a human.

3014
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:51,420
You can't be a human.

3015
01:22:51,421 --> 01:22:53,580
You can't have an ex
girlfriend or an ex boyfriend.

3016
01:22:53,850 --> 01:22:54,683
He can't have ever

3017
01:22:55,130 --> 01:22:56,680
puffed marijuana.

3018
01:22:56,681 --> 01:22:57,230
I mean,

3019
01:22:57,230 --> 01:22:58,790
I think we'd be great
with a gay president.

3020
01:22:58,820 --> 01:23:00,530
I think we need a gay guy or a gay girl.

3021
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:01,393
How about a Lesbos?

3022
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:02,540
Lesbophobic good.

3023
01:23:02,870 --> 01:23:04,640
Who would you go like Melissa Etheridge.

3024
01:23:05,190 --> 01:23:07,420
She would take this fucking
place in a good direction.

3025
01:23:07,810 --> 01:23:09,060
You don't think Hillary would.

3026
01:23:10,710 --> 01:23:12,340
A lot of people think
Hillary is in neo-con.

3027
01:23:12,370 --> 01:23:13,740
A lot of people think that Hillary,

3028
01:23:14,830 --> 01:23:18,100
someone who is in bed with the
military industrial complex,

3029
01:23:18,101 --> 01:23:19,780
someone who profits from war,

3030
01:23:19,781 --> 01:23:21,400
someone who is not like that.

3031
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:22,870
Well he certainly is.

3032
01:23:22,871 --> 01:23:23,704
Uh,

3033
01:23:23,890 --> 01:23:27,730
he certainly is a guy who is not
what everybody was hoping for.

3034
01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:30,580
Like everybody hopes he's going
to close down Guantanamo Bay,

3035
01:23:30,581 --> 01:23:31,850
pull everybody out of the wars,

3036
01:23:31,851 --> 01:23:34,470
straighten up America's
inner cities and same ad,

3037
01:23:34,540 --> 01:23:35,620
the same brand of person,

3038
01:23:35,621 --> 01:23:36,101
aren't they?

3039
01:23:36,101 --> 01:23:37,120
Hillary and Obama.

3040
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:42,160
I think everyone that gets into that
office has to be in bed with these

3041
01:23:42,221 --> 01:23:42,910
monsters.

3042
01:23:42,910 --> 01:23:45,820
Corporations that need to make
a massive amounts of money.

3043
01:23:45,821 --> 01:23:49,270
And the way they make massive amounts
of money is they bribe politicians.

3044
01:23:49,480 --> 01:23:51,490
They pay massive amounts of money.

3045
01:23:51,640 --> 01:23:54,960
Like when the Supreme Court
pass laws that say that the,

3046
01:23:54,970 --> 01:23:58,030
these corporations are
allowed to donate money,

3047
01:23:58,031 --> 01:24:00,010
like as if they were an individual entity.

3048
01:24:00,220 --> 01:24:04,240
Like if you're a person like save Natasha
Gera has $1 million in the bag and

3049
01:24:04,241 --> 01:24:04,481
you're like,

3050
01:24:04,481 --> 01:24:05,020
fuck it,

3051
01:24:05,020 --> 01:24:08,020
I'm donating my million
dollars to Hillary Clinton,

3052
01:24:08,021 --> 01:24:08,771
you can do that.

3053
01:24:08,771 --> 01:24:10,660
You can donate as much money as you want.

3054
01:24:10,810 --> 01:24:13,060
What you used to be
restrictions on corporations,

3055
01:24:13,061 --> 01:24:17,140
especially corporations that would
benefit from political influence.

3056
01:24:17,530 --> 01:24:19,150
And you know of those,

3057
01:24:20,490 --> 01:24:21,470
it's within the,

3058
01:24:21,590 --> 01:24:23,920
I think it was during
the Bush administration,

3059
01:24:24,130 --> 01:24:24,963
I think it was.

3060
01:24:25,050 --> 01:24:26,500
It was either Bush or Obama,

3061
01:24:26,501 --> 01:24:28,480
but it's fairly recent that they did that.

3062
01:24:28,750 --> 01:24:30,280
And as soon as you do that,

3063
01:24:30,281 --> 01:24:30,551
you,

3064
01:24:30,551 --> 01:24:30,940
you,

3065
01:24:30,940 --> 01:24:35,710
you open the flood gates for corruption
and influence lobbyists like law,

3066
01:24:35,740 --> 01:24:36,220
that law,

3067
01:24:36,220 --> 01:24:37,053
the idea of,

3068
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:40,510
I became educated about
lobbyists because of the UFC,

3069
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:41,891
because of the UFC,

3070
01:24:41,891 --> 01:24:45,400
had to hire a bunch of lobbyists in order
to get mixed martial arts past and all

3071
01:24:45,401 --> 01:24:46,420
these different states.

3072
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:48,130
Because when we first started,

3073
01:24:48,131 --> 01:24:51,550
it was only legal in a few
states and lot of states,

3074
01:24:51,551 --> 01:24:54,490
like right now it's legal in
every state except New York.

3075
01:24:54,491 --> 01:24:57,010
And the only reason why it's not legal
in New York is because of corruption.

3076
01:24:57,070 --> 01:24:57,903
And it's almost done.

3077
01:24:58,780 --> 01:24:59,290
Nope.

3078
01:24:59,290 --> 01:24:59,561
No.

3079
01:24:59,561 --> 01:25:03,400
And the one of the politicians that kept
it from being legal was just arrested

3080
01:25:03,401 --> 01:25:04,234
for corruption.

3081
01:25:04,570 --> 01:25:07,060
So it was hilarious when that
guy went down for corruption.

3082
01:25:07,061 --> 01:25:07,830
Everybody's like,

3083
01:25:07,830 --> 01:25:08,620
Duh.

3084
01:25:08,620 --> 01:25:11,020
Like it's the culinary
union is a big part of it,

3085
01:25:11,021 --> 01:25:11,380
but there's,

3086
01:25:11,380 --> 01:25:15,670
there's a lot of union influence
because long story short,

3087
01:25:15,671 --> 01:25:19,270
the UFC is owned by this company
that also owns station casinos.

3088
01:25:19,271 --> 01:25:22,870
They own 20 plus casinos and
they're non union casinos and they,

3089
01:25:22,990 --> 01:25:26,500
the culinary union wants them to be
union because if they were a union,

3090
01:25:26,501 --> 01:25:30,370
they would make some somewhere in the
neighborhood of $15 million a year.

3091
01:25:31,060 --> 01:25:31,900
Don't quote me on that.

3092
01:25:32,210 --> 01:25:32,560
Uh,

3093
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:33,820
from the dues.

3094
01:25:33,850 --> 01:25:34,400
So they're,

3095
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:34,701
they,

3096
01:25:34,701 --> 01:25:37,930
they've had this act of smear campaign
against the UFC and they spend a lot of

3097
01:25:37,931 --> 01:25:38,520
money.

3098
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:40,750
They try to get the UFC to leverage them,

3099
01:25:40,751 --> 01:25:41,381
to get the UFC,

3100
01:25:41,381 --> 01:25:44,110
to turn those casinos
and to union casinos.

3101
01:25:44,770 --> 01:25:48,280
So there's a lot of fucking
bullshit involved in politics.

3102
01:25:48,281 --> 01:25:51,910
And that's the kind of things
they're involved in passing laws.

3103
01:25:51,911 --> 01:25:52,780
It's a lot of money,

3104
01:25:52,781 --> 01:25:53,680
a lot of influence,

3105
01:25:53,681 --> 01:25:55,060
a lot of people bribing people.

3106
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:56,590
So to get to be president,

3107
01:25:56,920 --> 01:25:58,750
you'd have to play that fucking game.

3108
01:25:58,751 --> 01:26:01,510
And there's not gonna be any
white knights and that game,

3109
01:26:01,930 --> 01:26:03,590
there's going to be white or nights,

3110
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:04,131
you know,

3111
01:26:04,131 --> 01:26:06,800
like there's going to be darker nights
and wider nights and it's this fine

3112
01:26:06,801 --> 01:26:11,150
balance between public acceptance and
public support and the support of the

3113
01:26:11,151 --> 01:26:11,984
corporation.

3114
01:26:12,410 --> 01:26:13,243
The corporate,

3115
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:14,210
you can't have,

3116
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:15,680
you can't have one without the other.

3117
01:26:15,681 --> 01:26:17,540
You got Kinda like walk this fine line.

3118
01:26:17,780 --> 01:26:19,330
That's why we keep getting close.

3119
01:26:19,331 --> 01:26:19,940
He makes no sense.

3120
01:26:19,940 --> 01:26:20,720
Friends.

3121
01:26:20,720 --> 01:26:21,980
I don't think it makes a difference.

3122
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:23,600
I don't think it makes a difference.

3123
01:26:23,601 --> 01:26:24,620
I mean she's,

3124
01:26:24,650 --> 01:26:28,280
she's already been criticized
for being unduly influenced by,

3125
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:30,260
I mean that whole thing with her email.

3126
01:26:30,261 --> 01:26:34,010
She deleted all her fucking emails and
she was getting emails from a private

3127
01:26:34,011 --> 01:26:35,260
server instead of the,

3128
01:26:35,630 --> 01:26:38,220
the way you're supposed
to do it where it's in,

3129
01:26:38,221 --> 01:26:40,490
they can easily investigate all of the,

3130
01:26:40,491 --> 01:26:40,721
uh,

3131
01:26:40,721 --> 01:26:43,880
the transactions that have gone back and
forth or the communications that have

3132
01:26:43,881 --> 01:26:44,780
gone back and forth.

3133
01:26:45,020 --> 01:26:48,290
I try not to look at it too deeply
because it's so frustrating.

3134
01:26:48,291 --> 01:26:52,040
So I can only give you like a cursory
understanding of how the whole system

3135
01:26:52,041 --> 01:26:52,371
works.

3136
01:26:52,371 --> 01:26:55,140
But at the end of the day it's,

3137
01:26:55,180 --> 01:26:56,013
it's money.

3138
01:26:56,180 --> 01:27:00,170
I mean it's all about money and
these huge fucking corporations.

3139
01:27:00,500 --> 01:27:04,040
The difference between having someone
in then supports them and having someone

3140
01:27:04,041 --> 01:27:05,750
in there that's against them as PR,

3141
01:27:05,830 --> 01:27:09,140
especially when it comes to environmental
regulations and how difficult they

3142
01:27:09,141 --> 01:27:12,200
make it to do things like fracking
and all that kind of shit.

3143
01:27:12,650 --> 01:27:13,610
It's billions.

3144
01:27:13,640 --> 01:27:15,470
You're talking about billions
and billions of dollars,

3145
01:27:16,070 --> 01:27:19,940
so I don't think anybody gets there
unless they play that fucking game.

3146
01:27:19,960 --> 01:27:23,510
Then that's why the commission for
presidential debates is a privately funded

3147
01:27:23,511 --> 01:27:24,201
institution.

3148
01:27:24,201 --> 01:27:25,970
When you see those people debating on TV,

3149
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:28,040
like what does that,

3150
01:27:29,390 --> 01:27:30,260
you have to leave

3151
01:27:30,780 --> 01:27:33,460
but just you don't have to like
write it down on a piece of paper.

3152
01:27:35,450 --> 01:27:37,850
I wish I didn't have to go but I have to.

3153
01:27:37,890 --> 01:27:38,723
Let's do it again.

3154
01:27:38,830 --> 01:27:39,101
Listen,

3155
01:27:39,101 --> 01:27:41,980
you and I have been threatening to do a
podcast forever and we finally did it.

3156
01:27:42,050 --> 01:27:44,390
I got here because there
sometimes for hours,

3157
01:27:44,470 --> 01:27:45,250
no,

3158
01:27:45,250 --> 01:27:45,821
and I was like,

3159
01:27:45,821 --> 01:27:48,580
why have it til one does fine,

3160
01:27:48,581 --> 01:27:49,271
wine is good.

3161
01:27:49,271 --> 01:27:49,860
One is good.

3162
01:27:49,860 --> 01:27:50,693
Natasha,

3163
01:27:50,950 --> 01:27:51,850
you don't have to worry.

3164
01:27:52,420 --> 01:27:53,253
Listen,

3165
01:27:53,290 --> 01:27:54,490
let's do more often.

3166
01:27:54,670 --> 01:27:55,330
Come back.

3167
01:27:55,330 --> 01:27:56,530
I'm so depressed now.

3168
01:27:56,590 --> 01:27:57,220
Why?

3169
01:27:57,220 --> 01:27:58,010
Because you were thinking to,

3170
01:27:58,010 --> 01:28:00,820
Hillary's going to be the
the block Obama for women,

3171
01:28:00,850 --> 01:28:03,030
that country Western fuck.

3172
01:28:04,980 --> 01:28:05,730
You know what I mean?

3173
01:28:05,730 --> 01:28:08,420
How they're just like
purposely just dumbing it down,

3174
01:28:08,450 --> 01:28:10,430
dumbing it down for like,

3175
01:28:10,550 --> 01:28:11,211
well it's a hustle.

3176
01:28:11,211 --> 01:28:12,470
It's like a guy who wants a rape you,

3177
01:28:12,471 --> 01:28:13,700
but he shows up with flowers.

3178
01:28:14,420 --> 01:28:15,950
He's trying to get you
to think he's a good guy.

3179
01:28:16,450 --> 01:28:18,370
Who's the best person to be like,

3180
01:28:18,371 --> 01:28:18,671
do you think?

3181
01:28:18,671 --> 01:28:21,190
Like if you had to pick a
Bush or a Clinton for comedy,

3182
01:28:21,191 --> 01:28:22,001
it would be a Bush,

3183
01:28:22,001 --> 01:28:22,834
right?

3184
01:28:22,930 --> 01:28:23,560
Yes.

3185
01:28:23,560 --> 01:28:27,400
US like we'll have like a
glory day or glory period.

3186
01:28:27,401 --> 01:28:27,731
Right?

3187
01:28:27,731 --> 01:28:28,540
Comedian.

3188
01:28:28,540 --> 01:28:29,111
Yeah.

3189
01:28:29,111 --> 01:28:29,890
Like people.

3190
01:28:29,890 --> 01:28:30,101
Yeah.

3191
01:28:30,101 --> 01:28:33,190
Cause people would want to go out
to the clubs and talk about it.

3192
01:28:33,590 --> 01:28:34,423
You know?

3193
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:35,260
I don't think we're,

3194
01:28:35,260 --> 01:28:36,280
we're supposed to think that way.

3195
01:28:36,281 --> 01:28:39,020
There's plenty of dumb shit going on
in the world without having it be.

3196
01:28:39,350 --> 01:28:39,490
Oh,

3197
01:28:39,490 --> 01:28:40,141
I'm not saying,

3198
01:28:40,141 --> 01:28:40,621
I know.

3199
01:28:40,621 --> 01:28:40,921
I know.

3200
01:28:40,921 --> 01:28:41,221
I'm just,

3201
01:28:41,221 --> 01:28:41,821
I'm just thinking.

3202
01:28:41,821 --> 01:28:41,980
Yeah.

3203
01:28:41,980 --> 01:28:42,820
Here's my hope.

3204
01:28:42,910 --> 01:28:43,743
I have a hope.

3205
01:28:43,960 --> 01:28:48,070
My hope is that the
Internet is so pervasive.

3206
01:28:48,130 --> 01:28:53,130
It's so deeply embedded in everyone's
life and the Internet is all about the

3207
01:28:54,071 --> 01:28:57,130
exchange of information and
information is being exchanged.

3208
01:28:57,131 --> 01:28:57,851
New Information.

3209
01:28:57,851 --> 01:28:58,450
Yes,

3210
01:28:58,450 --> 01:28:59,283
and it's

3211
01:28:59,660 --> 01:29:01,140
way words Noo

3212
01:29:01,170 --> 01:29:02,640
new and not just that,

3213
01:29:02,641 --> 01:29:03,474
but facts.

3214
01:29:03,720 --> 01:29:06,690
Knowing the reality of climate change of,

3215
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:07,411
of a,

3216
01:29:07,411 --> 01:29:08,250
of war,

3217
01:29:08,251 --> 01:29:09,150
of profits.

3218
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:14,480
The reality that we have when it comes
to like understanding what's going on in

3219
01:29:14,611 --> 01:29:15,450
the world is,

3220
01:29:15,460 --> 01:29:15,850
is,

3221
01:29:15,850 --> 01:29:17,190
is unprecedented.

3222
01:29:17,550 --> 01:29:18,870
It's instantaneous.

3223
01:29:18,871 --> 01:29:19,950
You have questions about that.

3224
01:29:19,951 --> 01:29:20,820
You can't be lied.

3225
01:29:20,821 --> 01:29:21,660
Like you know,

3226
01:29:21,661 --> 01:29:25,860
I remember Ronald Reagan on TV lying
about the new studies are coming out that

3227
01:29:25,861 --> 01:29:30,690
says that marijuana is one of the most
dangerous trucks ever known that was

3228
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:31,650
going,

3229
01:29:31,650 --> 01:29:32,281
he was a liar.

3230
01:29:32,281 --> 01:29:34,980
He was lying to people and
because they were paying the lot,

3231
01:29:35,190 --> 01:29:37,320
if a politician tried to do that today,

3232
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:39,390
the Internet would fucking explode.

3233
01:29:39,391 --> 01:29:40,500
Everyone would go nuts.

3234
01:29:40,680 --> 01:29:41,170
It was like,

3235
01:29:41,170 --> 01:29:44,390
we remember when Obama wanted to go into
Syria and Obama was saying that we've

3236
01:29:44,391 --> 01:29:47,970
got to go into Syria and literally the
entire Internet went fucking crazy.

3237
01:29:48,150 --> 01:29:49,620
The entire country was like,

3238
01:29:49,621 --> 01:29:50,490
fuck this.

3239
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:53,280
We're involved in two fucking
wars and you want to go to Syria.

3240
01:29:53,460 --> 01:29:54,810
What's the big deal about Syria?

3241
01:29:54,930 --> 01:29:57,210
What exactly the fuck
is happening in Syria?

3242
01:29:57,460 --> 01:29:59,400
You think that what everybody's
done that is going to,

3243
01:29:59,650 --> 01:30:00,690
I think the Internet,

3244
01:30:00,691 --> 01:30:03,390
what the Internet represents
is the exchange of information.

3245
01:30:03,540 --> 01:30:04,740
I don't think the voice of the Internet,

3246
01:30:04,741 --> 01:30:08,580
I think it's human beings having the truth
where they've never had it before and

3247
01:30:08,581 --> 01:30:11,850
having the ability to express themselves
in a way that they've never had before

3248
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,850
and all they would have to do to
change all this shit really change it,

3249
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:15,840
is abandoned.

3250
01:30:15,841 --> 01:30:20,180
This fucking antiquated bullshit corrupt
system and have people vote online.

3251
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:21,630
How you could help people.

3252
01:30:21,830 --> 01:30:24,030
You have people try make transactions.

3253
01:30:24,150 --> 01:30:26,580
You could fucking do your banking online.

3254
01:30:26,730 --> 01:30:27,331
I've got apple,

3255
01:30:27,331 --> 01:30:27,691
Pam,

3256
01:30:27,691 --> 01:30:28,410
I'd phone.

3257
01:30:28,410 --> 01:30:29,880
I could buy shit online.

3258
01:30:29,881 --> 01:30:31,410
Everyone's doing things online,

3259
01:30:31,830 --> 01:30:33,780
but you can't vote online.

3260
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:34,800
That's ridiculous.

3261
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:35,671
The reason being,

3262
01:30:35,671 --> 01:30:37,260
if you make it really easy to vote,

3263
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:41,580
then really everybody has a say instead
of having the way they have it now where

3264
01:30:41,581 --> 01:30:42,270
it's this,

3265
01:30:42,270 --> 01:30:42,511
you know,

3266
01:30:42,511 --> 01:30:45,270
you have the electoral college
and you don't really vote.

3267
01:30:45,271 --> 01:30:48,180
You vote for a representative and that
representative represents your state or

3268
01:30:48,181 --> 01:30:48,960
your district.

3269
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:50,310
It's all cocked bullshit.

3270
01:30:50,340 --> 01:30:51,240
It's nonsense.

3271
01:30:51,480 --> 01:30:56,480
What they need to do is revamp the system
and revamp the system in a way that

3272
01:30:56,821 --> 01:31:00,840
reflects the actual will of the people
and that will radically change the world

3273
01:31:01,050 --> 01:31:03,690
because the will of the people is
educated now in a way that it's never been

3274
01:31:03,691 --> 01:31:04,280
before.

3275
01:31:04,280 --> 01:31:05,600
How do we make that happen?

3276
01:31:05,601 --> 01:31:10,340
How do we raise money for a
revamping the electoral college?

3277
01:31:10,430 --> 01:31:14,510
I think slowly but surely
the system that's in place
is more and more ridiculous

3278
01:31:14,511 --> 01:31:15,330
every year

3279
01:31:15,330 --> 01:31:15,960
it seems to me.

3280
01:31:15,960 --> 01:31:16,793
Look at that song.

3281
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:17,580
Yeah,

3282
01:31:17,580 --> 01:31:19,950
that is an actual not SNL sketch.

3283
01:31:20,700 --> 01:31:22,290
I mean that's an actual,

3284
01:31:22,330 --> 01:31:23,250
you and I are laughing.

3285
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:25,140
Do you know any fucking people
were crying when they heard that?

3286
01:31:25,170 --> 01:31:29,320
We do need to take back
America for your portions.

3287
01:31:33,060 --> 01:31:33,541
By the way,

3288
01:31:33,541 --> 01:31:35,310
I'm not having a lot of abortions.

3289
01:31:35,311 --> 01:31:36,530
I'm just saying how many of you out?

3290
01:31:36,550 --> 01:31:37,111
Zero.

3291
01:31:37,111 --> 01:31:38,820
But I would love to have one if I had,

3292
01:31:38,850 --> 01:31:39,683
if I needed to.

3293
01:31:39,990 --> 01:31:40,823
I can't wait.

3294
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:43,141
I'll relish.

3295
01:31:43,141 --> 01:31:43,311
I'll,

3296
01:31:43,311 --> 01:31:43,521
I'll,

3297
01:31:43,521 --> 01:31:43,651
I'll,

3298
01:31:43,651 --> 01:31:44,540
I'll periscope it.

3299
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:49,833
Periscope,

3300
01:31:50,870 --> 01:31:51,703
that's another,

3301
01:31:51,810 --> 01:31:53,310
another new internet thing.

3302
01:31:53,910 --> 01:31:56,160
Getting people closer
and closer to each other.

3303
01:31:56,790 --> 01:31:57,930
We live in a weird time.

3304
01:31:57,931 --> 01:31:58,560
Natasha.

3305
01:31:58,560 --> 01:31:58,830
I'm going to

3306
01:31:58,830 --> 01:31:59,200
tweet.

3307
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:00,430
I'm periscoping my abortion.

3308
01:32:00,450 --> 01:32:01,283
Intense.

3309
01:32:02,530 --> 01:32:04,030
I'm going to periscope you.

3310
01:32:04,240 --> 01:32:07,850
You ending this podcast right
now on periscope it right now.

3311
01:32:07,851 --> 01:32:08,710
How many more questions,

3312
01:32:08,711 --> 01:32:09,151
but we'll,

3313
01:32:09,151 --> 01:32:09,460
we'll,

3314
01:32:09,460 --> 01:32:11,710
we'll talk next time you have questions.

3315
01:32:11,770 --> 01:32:11,921
Well,

3316
01:32:11,921 --> 01:32:12,101
no,

3317
01:32:12,101 --> 01:32:13,330
I just wanted to get your thoughts on,

3318
01:32:13,410 --> 01:32:13,691
you know,

3319
01:32:13,691 --> 01:32:14,021
whatever.

3320
01:32:14,021 --> 01:32:15,100
There's a lot of things happening.

3321
01:32:15,101 --> 01:32:15,371
I'm now,

3322
01:32:15,371 --> 01:32:16,204
I'm all amped.

3323
01:32:17,320 --> 01:32:18,340
Let's do this again soon,

3324
01:32:18,360 --> 01:32:19,420
but we do this again more often.

3325
01:32:19,421 --> 01:32:20,020
Yes.

3326
01:32:20,020 --> 01:32:21,220
You should have your own podcast too,

3327
01:32:21,221 --> 01:32:21,760
by the way.

3328
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:22,361
You Know Dunkin?

3329
01:32:22,361 --> 01:32:23,620
I had like the first podcast.

3330
01:32:23,650 --> 01:32:24,520
Yes you did.

3331
01:32:24,550 --> 01:32:24,851
But why?

3332
01:32:24,851 --> 01:32:25,241
It's hard.

3333
01:32:25,241 --> 01:32:26,650
What came over to our house and was like,

3334
01:32:26,651 --> 01:32:26,951
wait,

3335
01:32:26,951 --> 01:32:30,250
so you just like record into the
microphone and release it every week.

3336
01:32:30,900 --> 01:32:33,940
The first guest now he's got
a network we created Nerdist.

3337
01:32:33,980 --> 01:32:34,813
Yeah,

3338
01:32:34,970 --> 01:32:35,710
some sort of the way.

3339
01:32:35,710 --> 01:32:36,660
Who's your first guest?

3340
01:32:37,240 --> 01:32:38,410
That's hilarious.

3341
01:32:38,440 --> 01:32:39,640
That is really fucking hot.

3342
01:32:39,670 --> 01:32:39,821
Yeah.

3343
01:32:39,821 --> 01:32:41,920
You guys were doing one like one again,

3344
01:32:41,921 --> 01:32:42,940
just understood it.

3345
01:32:42,940 --> 01:32:43,481
I don't know,

3346
01:32:43,481 --> 01:32:44,380
like a long time ago,

3347
01:32:44,381 --> 01:32:45,680
maybe seven years ago or something.

3348
01:32:45,690 --> 01:32:46,780
It wasn't that long ago.

3349
01:32:47,010 --> 01:32:47,740
Six years ago.

3350
01:32:47,740 --> 01:32:48,760
It wasn't doing it before.

3351
01:32:48,761 --> 01:32:50,590
I was doing it probably.

3352
01:32:50,650 --> 01:32:51,220
Wow.

3353
01:32:51,220 --> 01:32:51,791
That's crazy.

3354
01:32:51,791 --> 01:32:53,050
I know that no one had one.

3355
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:54,040
No one.

3356
01:32:54,040 --> 01:32:54,300
I mean,

3357
01:32:54,300 --> 01:32:55,330
Chris Hardwick did.

3358
01:32:55,510 --> 01:32:56,250
He did,

3359
01:32:56,250 --> 01:32:56,780
but he,

3360
01:32:56,780 --> 01:32:58,420
his was always more of a radio show,

3361
01:32:58,421 --> 01:32:58,650
you know?

3362
01:32:58,650 --> 01:32:58,960
Right.

3363
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:03,960
It's still is Natasha [inaudible] raw
people can get you online to Taj Lucero on

3364
01:33:05,291 --> 01:33:06,124
Twitter.

3365
01:33:06,220 --> 01:33:07,053
What else?

3366
01:33:07,380 --> 01:33:07,840
Um,

3367
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:08,350
oh,

3368
01:33:08,350 --> 01:33:08,561
uh,

3369
01:33:08,561 --> 01:33:09,311
our new show,

3370
01:33:09,311 --> 01:33:12,790
another period comes out on
comedy central June 23rd.

3371
01:33:12,791 --> 01:33:13,151
It's a,

3372
01:33:13,151 --> 01:33:13,984
it's like if the,

3373
01:33:14,110 --> 01:33:15,430
it takes place in 1902.

3374
01:33:15,431 --> 01:33:15,761
It's like,

3375
01:33:15,761 --> 01:33:18,400
imagine if the Kardashians
moved into Downton Abbey.

3376
01:33:19,290 --> 01:33:20,200
That's my new show.

3377
01:33:20,201 --> 01:33:21,340
And it's a reality show.

3378
01:33:21,740 --> 01:33:23,590
It is after Amy Schumer.

3379
01:33:23,830 --> 01:33:25,810
I'm so controlling like
a fake reality show.

3380
01:33:25,820 --> 01:33:26,340
Okay.

3381
01:33:26,340 --> 01:33:26,770
Okay.

3382
01:33:26,770 --> 01:33:27,310
Okay.

3383
01:33:27,310 --> 01:33:28,230
Don't be confused.

3384
01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:29,680
Yeah.

3385
01:33:29,680 --> 01:33:30,350
Okay.

3386
01:33:30,350 --> 01:33:30,760
All right.

3387
01:33:30,760 --> 01:33:31,600
Thank you so much.

3388
01:33:31,630 --> 01:33:32,620
Thank you for having me.

3389
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:33,833
I love having you on.

3390
01:33:34,060 --> 01:33:34,780
Let's do it again.

3391
01:33:34,780 --> 01:33:35,290
Alright.

3392
01:33:35,290 --> 01:33:35,920
Alright.

3393
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:36,610
See you soon.

3394
01:33:36,610 --> 01:33:37,250
You fucks.

3395
01:33:37,250 --> 01:33:37,471
All right.

3396
01:33:37,471 --> 01:33:38,304

3397
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:39,313

3398
01:33:43,180 --> 01:33:45,320
Give me your mind bridge box.

3399
01:33:45,810 --> 01:33:45,901
Oh,

01:33:45,901 --> 01:33:47,180

3401
01:33:47,190 --> 01:33:48,180

3402
01:33:48,670 --> 01:33:49,503
It should be awesome.

3403
01:33:56,860 --> 01:33:56,930
Yeah.
