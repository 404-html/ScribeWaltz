1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,730
Then all of a sudden pull back.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,410
I don't even know back.

3
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:04,620
I don't even know if it's corruption.

4
00:00:04,621 --> 00:00:04,710
I,

5
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:05,760
I think it's a,

6
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:07,100
you don't know if it's good then I'll go.

7
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,100
In other words where I mean is that,

8
00:00:08,101 --> 00:00:11,580
I just think that the system
in place is the only way you,

9
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,040
yeah,

10
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:12,580
that's perfect.

11
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:13,170
That's what it is.

12
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:13,351
Yeah.

13
00:00:13,351 --> 00:00:16,170
So I mean they're not going to fix that
system of that system has made them

14
00:00:16,171 --> 00:00:17,004
billions of dollars.

15
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:21,540
They're going to do whatever meager
patchwork they need to do within their

16
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:24,370
lifetime to keep on the majority of
the wealth that they've acquired.

17
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:25,001
I've said before,

18
00:00:25,001 --> 00:00:25,441
I try it,

19
00:00:25,441 --> 00:00:27,180
try getting rid of a law now try,

20
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,073
just try.

21
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:29,690
Let's skip.

22
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:33,730
Let's step outside of the
boundaries cause I tire of these,

23
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:35,430
these questions and these,

24
00:00:35,431 --> 00:00:35,731
these,

25
00:00:35,731 --> 00:00:36,271
these things.

26
00:00:36,271 --> 00:00:41,271
And one of the reasons why I tire of it
is because everyone seems to have some

27
00:00:42,451 --> 00:00:47,451
sort of a position in this machine and
everyone is describing all the varieties

28
00:00:48,991 --> 00:00:52,410
of issues within these positions of these,

29
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:57,520
these different statements and different
belief systems that everybody has a

30
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:00,390
subscribed to when it comes to this world.

31
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:01,350
And how everything runs.

32
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:03,580
What's the ideal way to do it?

33
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:04,770
If you could,

34
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,090
if you were a guy,

35
00:01:06,091 --> 00:01:07,890
and I know that you've thought of this,

36
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:13,130
if you were a guy that could
stop everything and figure
out how to make an even

37
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:14,941
system,

38
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:15,870
what would you do?

39
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,130
How would you engineer it?

40
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,410
If someone came up to you and said,

41
00:01:19,411 --> 00:01:19,951
listen dude,

42
00:01:19,951 --> 00:01:21,270
we're gonna let you go on television.

43
00:01:21,271 --> 00:01:22,920
You have a year to formulate a plan.

44
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,230
I think you're a smart guy and I
think this is what the world needs.

45
00:01:25,231 --> 00:01:27,330
The world's needs a smart dude
who thinks out of the box.

46
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:28,373
You get together,

47
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,940
you have one year come up with a fucking
plan as to how to redistribute the

48
00:01:32,941 --> 00:01:37,710
whole thing had had a refigure out where
where the money gets stored and what's

49
00:01:37,711 --> 00:01:39,690
the money is based on and you know,

50
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:40,250
what are,

51
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:42,630
what are acceptable interest rates.

52
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:44,610
And I would probably do,

53
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,440
I would probably start with a flat tax.

54
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:48,420
And what I mean by that is I would have,

55
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:49,380
no matter who you are,

56
00:01:49,381 --> 00:01:50,214
where you stand,

57
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,430
you pay 30% you pay 30% across the board.

58
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,100
So instead of having 6,000 pages of taxes,

59
00:01:56,101 --> 00:01:57,300
I know there are problems with it,

60
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,261
but for the most part,

61
00:01:58,261 --> 00:01:59,790
I'd make it as fair as possible.

62
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,080
May Not be as fair to,

63
00:02:01,081 --> 00:02:01,680
you know,

64
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,700
rich people pay more,

65
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:03,930
they're gonna pay more ultimately.

66
00:02:03,931 --> 00:02:04,351
But you know,

67
00:02:04,351 --> 00:02:06,060
poor people still have
to pay 30% right now.

68
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:08,430
A lot of poor people don't
pay any taxes at all.

69
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:09,361
Maybe that's good.

70
00:02:09,361 --> 00:02:09,541
See,

71
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:13,110
this is where I would step back and
the tax code is so fucking complicated.

72
00:02:13,111 --> 00:02:15,660
Did I might just say flat
tax across the board,

73
00:02:15,661 --> 00:02:16,494
no matter who you are,

74
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,850
you pay 30% of your income.

75
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:21,360
I think if you are poor
and you are struggling,

76
00:02:21,361 --> 00:02:22,890
you should have to pay much less.

77
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,050
And I think that a guy like
me should have to pay more.

78
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:25,850
I think that,

79
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:26,910
I agree with that.

80
00:02:26,911 --> 00:02:27,501
I think it's,

81
00:02:27,501 --> 00:02:28,620
it's a creepy argument.

82
00:02:28,621 --> 00:02:29,454
And I,

83
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:29,730
I,

84
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:30,360
if I,

85
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,500
this is the caveat though,

86
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:35,520
if I believed that it
was being spent wisely,

87
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:38,220
if I believe that that was
the answer and I don't,

88
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:39,320
this brings me back to the doers.

89
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:42,270
And the question is that I
don't believe there's any way.

90
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,590
I don't believe that
any large bureaucracy,

91
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,090
I don't care if it's a corporation,

92
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,680
especially not the US government,

93
00:02:49,681 --> 00:02:52,170
because there's no accountability and
you don't have to have a bottom line.

94
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:53,460
You don't have to produce a profit,

95
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:53,840
you,

96
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,060
you,

97
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:54,511
there's no,

98
00:02:54,511 --> 00:02:56,030
there's no marketplace telling you,

99
00:02:56,031 --> 00:02:56,111
you,

100
00:02:56,111 --> 00:02:56,791
you go out of business.

101
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:58,680
I mean since what was it?

102
00:02:58,681 --> 00:03:00,990
1960 fucking letters problem.

103
00:03:00,991 --> 00:03:01,824
It's a business.

104
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:02,111
How many,

105
00:03:02,111 --> 00:03:02,441
how many,

106
00:03:02,441 --> 00:03:05,890
how many fortune five hundreds are
have the 500 companies that were in

107
00:03:05,891 --> 00:03:06,400
existence.

108
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,390
It started when they started tracking
the fortune 500 how many are in existence

109
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:13,020
since 1967 how many earnings?

110
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:15,160
It's not the 500 I believe
eight are still running.

111
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,620
Companies go out of business
all the fucking time.

112
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,520
Why?

113
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,353
They just run out.

114
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,200
They just run out of product
to whatever their ship.

115
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,340
That's how it goes.

116
00:03:24,341 --> 00:03:24,971
And guess what?

117
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:26,530
These rooms for another startup.

118
00:03:26,531 --> 00:03:26,830
Yes.

119
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:27,041
Yes.

120
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,000
Where that hasn't happened,

121
00:03:28,001 --> 00:03:31,720
the pharmaceutical industries there are
so fucking big that they control the

122
00:03:31,721 --> 00:03:32,380
FDA.

123
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,250
A whole nother story.

124
00:03:33,251 --> 00:03:34,240
So the point is this,

125
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:35,200
my feeling,

126
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:40,380
my feeling is that the only way that you
are always going to have private look

127
00:03:41,231 --> 00:03:41,351
at,

128
00:03:41,351 --> 00:03:42,810
look at the military industrial complex.

129
00:03:42,811 --> 00:03:47,440
You are always going to have private
sector people manipulating tax dollars and

130
00:03:47,441 --> 00:03:50,050
government agencies to their,

131
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,780
to their benefit then and as a result,

132
00:03:52,781 --> 00:03:55,630
it's impossible for the government not
to get involved in the marketplace.

133
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:56,710
It's impossible.

134
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:58,690
You don't have a free market,

135
00:03:58,691 --> 00:04:00,310
you don't have a market system anymore,

136
00:04:00,311 --> 00:04:03,670
especially not in the banking industry
has been regulated since fucking 1900

137
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,300
[inaudible].

138
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:09,040
So what I would do very simply is I'd
have a flat tax and I would ultimately get

139
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,420
rid of all subsidies,

140
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:13,060
all except for Medicare,

141
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:13,901
Medicaid,

142
00:04:13,901 --> 00:04:16,090
and that I would hope and
including social security,

143
00:04:16,091 --> 00:04:21,091
I would overhaul in that I would find
out who deserves fucking Medicare.

144
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:24,730
There are a lot of very wealthy people
who get it to shows all the sudden become

145
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:26,980
a really boring political debate.

146
00:04:26,981 --> 00:04:27,814
The issues,

147
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:28,751
I'm sorry,

148
00:04:28,751 --> 00:04:29,770
but it goes on forever.

149
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,780
It does real specific where your points,

150
00:04:31,781 --> 00:04:32,451
and I was starting to fade.

151
00:04:32,451 --> 00:04:35,020
You should talk about the
corruption in Avon and corporations.

152
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:36,420
Avon because pink cars,

153
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,770
every time you talk about question,

154
00:04:38,771 --> 00:04:40,330
I think both to bring it
down to a general thing.

155
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:41,051
People understand.

156
00:04:41,051 --> 00:04:41,840
I think you know,

157
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,820
you just got to realize that.

158
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,200
Just always ask yourself,

159
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:46,180
how the fuck would I
react in that situation?

160
00:04:46,181 --> 00:04:47,290
If you really learned about this stuff,

161
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:50,680
a lot of this shit is you get into these
like these guys get in and stuff and

162
00:04:50,681 --> 00:04:50,900
you're like,

163
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:51,940
that guy's fucking evil.

164
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:54,520
And in movies you see the
evil guy with the black hat,

165
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,480
Shit's always way more complicated and
way more fucking gray than that because

166
00:04:58,481 --> 00:04:58,931
corporate,

167
00:04:58,931 --> 00:04:59,160
you know me,

168
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,970
you've seen the documentary
of the corporation,

169
00:05:00,971 --> 00:05:01,360
right?

170
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,150
Where they detail how
corporations act as sociopath's,

171
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,530
the act of psychopaths.

172
00:05:05,531 --> 00:05:08,200
They ask these people who don't care
about the repercussions because there's a

173
00:05:08,201 --> 00:05:10,900
diffusion of responsibility
because there's a million
people in the corporation.

174
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:12,063
There you go.

175
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,593
Deep Shit guys.

176
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:14,590
Well,

177
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:15,423
I think,

178
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:15,911
you know,

179
00:05:15,911 --> 00:05:17,860
when I look at what's going on right now,

180
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:22,890
I see a bunch of different factors and
the big factor that I think is a not

181
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:28,531
being paid as much attention to in all
of this is that the whole problem is the

182
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:33,220
access to information and that this
system has always been corrupt and the

183
00:05:33,221 --> 00:05:34,840
system has always been running fairly,

184
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,040
but we didn't know it.

185
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,600
We didn't know what
the way we know it now.

186
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,910
And the access to information
is unprecedented now.

187
00:05:39,911 --> 00:05:43,330
And because of the people were starting
to exchange information and because of

188
00:05:43,331 --> 00:05:46,000
this access to information
and social networking,

189
00:05:46,001 --> 00:05:48,580
they're allowed to do it in
real time and they're organized.

190
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:50,670
It's also easy to manipulate information,

191
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:50,921
you know,

192
00:05:50,921 --> 00:05:52,660
that's the irony of it
is like you got you,

193
00:05:52,661 --> 00:05:54,190
you have so much access to information,

194
00:05:54,191 --> 00:05:55,840
it's really easy to manipulate.

195
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,070
You see political parties
do that shit all the time.

196
00:05:58,071 --> 00:05:58,490
Sure.

197
00:05:58,490 --> 00:05:58,851
Of course.

198
00:05:58,851 --> 00:05:59,090
Yeah.

199
00:05:59,090 --> 00:05:59,960
Eventually it's going to,

200
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:02,860
there's going to be something that allows
people to know whether something not,

201
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:03,703
it's true.

202
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,420
And that's when things are
going to get really strange.

203
00:06:05,421 --> 00:06:10,280
And it's really not that big of a deal
to be able to exclude disinformation and

204
00:06:10,281 --> 00:06:14,750
incorrect information to have some way
of proving things to be factually correct

205
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:15,531
before,

206
00:06:15,531 --> 00:06:15,760
uh,

207
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,600
they released and spread their will.

208
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,120
That's not that far outside
of the realm of possibility.

209
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,200
So right now there's a,

210
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:25,010
you mean it's whether or not you can
prove something to be true and factual,

211
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:25,431
you know,

212
00:06:25,431 --> 00:06:25,661
that,

213
00:06:25,661 --> 00:06:25,881
that,

214
00:06:25,881 --> 00:06:26,091
you know,

215
00:06:26,091 --> 00:06:29,330
like when you look at like these
databases like Wolfram Alpha and you know,

216
00:06:29,331 --> 00:06:30,080
like Siri,

217
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:30,861
the Siri thing,

218
00:06:30,861 --> 00:06:34,520
we talking to the apple thing and it
goes to the web and find out information

219
00:06:34,521 --> 00:06:35,540
and brings it back to you.

220
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:40,860
There's going to eventually be a very
clear system of finding out what is true

221
00:06:41,691 --> 00:06:42,680
and what is not true.

222
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,611
There's going to be a,

223
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:47,270
it's going to be very easy
to detect what is propaganda,

224
00:06:47,271 --> 00:06:48,590
what is actual fact,

225
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,840
and you're gonna be able
to know it in real time.

226
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,310
And when that happens,

227
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,350
then it's going to be way
harder to pull off corruption.

228
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:55,160
Well,

229
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:55,721
that's what I,

230
00:06:55,721 --> 00:06:56,660
I just keep wondering,

231
00:06:56,661 --> 00:06:59,690
like I always find myself asking how are
things going to get better in 20 years?

232
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:00,240
Worst,

233
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:00,921
how about 40?

234
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:01,401
It's better.

235
00:07:01,401 --> 00:07:02,000
Listen man,

236
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,740
here's what everybody's
woe is being about.

237
00:07:03,741 --> 00:07:04,190
Man.

238
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:04,371
You know,

239
00:07:04,371 --> 00:07:08,540
there was a study recently that I tweeted
the talked about violence that it was

240
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:09,090
a um,

241
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:09,260
uh,

242
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:12,920
Kurt's well study violence is at
an all time low in per capita.

243
00:07:12,921 --> 00:07:13,820
Like people are much,

244
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:18,020
much less violent and much it's life
today as much safer than it's ever been at

245
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:19,190
any other time in human history.

246
00:07:19,191 --> 00:07:20,150
Things are getting better.

247
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:24,470
It's just right now I think
we're in the process of a birth,

248
00:07:24,471 --> 00:07:25,820
we're in the process of a,

249
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:28,820
another stage and it's really
close to bottlenecking.

250
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:29,863
There's with the,

251
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,201
the,

252
00:07:30,201 --> 00:07:34,090
the influx of technology and information
into the world of the monkey is,

253
00:07:34,091 --> 00:07:39,091
is so complete right now
and we are biologically
struggling to keep up with all

254
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:42,650
this new shit that's going on around
us all the time and all this new

255
00:07:42,651 --> 00:07:45,080
information and all these
new challenges and all this,

256
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:45,711
you know,

257
00:07:45,711 --> 00:07:46,370
these,

258
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:46,610
the,

259
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:50,030
these new issues that are
presenting themselves to us.

260
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:52,400
And it's thing because of technology,

261
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:53,750
it almost feels like,

262
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,080
you know,

263
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,200
they're talking about the planet
and it's warming and all that stuff.

264
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:56,540
And I,

265
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,620
I always feel like is that,

266
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,210
is that essentially like,

267
00:07:59,240 --> 00:07:59,840
um,

268
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,060
the,

269
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:00,250
the,

270
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:04,910
the idea that we keep growing as like
literally an organism where we're going to

271
00:08:04,911 --> 00:08:07,790
have to mesh with machines just
to survive in an environment.

272
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,200
It's all kind of part of it,

273
00:08:09,201 --> 00:08:09,680
you know?

274
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:09,841
Well,

275
00:08:09,841 --> 00:08:12,380
there's also the idea that machines
are a life form in and of itself.

276
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,130
You look like,

277
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:14,240
I,

278
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,021
I've always said this,

279
00:08:15,021 --> 00:08:15,940
if you look at like,

280
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:16,611
I'm stupid,

281
00:08:16,611 --> 00:08:18,020
I could keep old computers.

282
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,101
I have like an old,

283
00:08:19,101 --> 00:08:19,940
a gray,

284
00:08:19,941 --> 00:08:20,361
one of those,

285
00:08:20,361 --> 00:08:20,500
uh,

286
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,940
Tan Apple fucking towers.

287
00:08:22,941 --> 00:08:24,140
It's in my garage somewhere.

288
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,010
It doesn't work anymore.

289
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:28,150
I have an old laptop with a little track
wheel on it and it doesn't work anymore

290
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:28,520
either.

291
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,300
Those are skeletons.

292
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,140
Those are dead animals.

293
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,520
Those are things that they,

294
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:31,971
their,

295
00:08:31,971 --> 00:08:33,410
their predecessors,

296
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:33,951
you know,

297
00:08:33,951 --> 00:08:34,830
or rather there were,

298
00:08:34,831 --> 00:08:35,630
there they are,

299
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:38,720
the predecessors from
today's sleek laptops,

300
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:39,280
you know,

301
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:39,520
there,

302
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,060
they're old shitty,

303
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:41,431
the,

304
00:08:41,431 --> 00:08:42,231
they're clunky.

305
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:44,360
They make weird noises
when he turned them on.

306
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:44,990
You know,

307
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:47,050
I mean they are essentially
the monkeys of the,

308
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:47,840
you know,

309
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:51,830
in comparison to us and I
think it's real possible.

310
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:56,130
But if we do have some sort of an
artificial intelligence and we do create a

311
00:08:56,131 --> 00:08:58,230
life form out of computers,

312
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:00,300
is able to recreate other life forms,

313
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,980
I think that's probably the next stage.

314
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,310
Why are we so we,

315
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:07,290
when we personally think that it's
so important that we continue this,

316
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:12,740
this animal struggle with emotions and
sperm and eggs and biology as we know it,

317
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,620
when biology is we're
knowing might be biology,

318
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,380
we might be much more
comfortable inside of a robot.

319
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,041
But I was going to say,

320
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:20,350
I mean,

321
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:20,521
but,

322
00:09:20,521 --> 00:09:20,721
but,

323
00:09:20,721 --> 00:09:20,871
but,

324
00:09:20,871 --> 00:09:21,840
but human beings,

325
00:09:21,841 --> 00:09:24,330
it seems are on the verge of
actually creating a whole,

326
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:29,070
a whole new kind of bio synthetic biology
that we're going to be able to match.

327
00:09:29,071 --> 00:09:31,320
But who's to say that
that's synthetic biology?

328
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:35,430
You can't be just as way better
or a better way better man.

329
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,121
This is like a,

330
00:09:36,121 --> 00:09:36,491
W we,

331
00:09:36,491 --> 00:09:39,120
we have is like an old car
that's made out of cardboard.

332
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:39,421
That's it.

333
00:09:39,421 --> 00:09:44,421
And we're on our way to building some
fucking carbon fiber fiber optic laced

334
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,080
electronic fucking mid engine beast,

335
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,470
constructing ears that
can hear a mile away,

336
00:09:49,471 --> 00:09:49,921
et cetera.

337
00:09:49,921 --> 00:09:50,490
I'll take it.

338
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:53,850
The problem is it keeps raining and our
fucking cardboard house slowly falling

339
00:09:53,851 --> 00:09:54,331
apart.

340
00:09:54,331 --> 00:09:55,260
But like Jesus Christ,

341
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:55,990
hurry up,

342
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,460
fix this cardboard car,

343
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:01,110
the cardboard cars all fucked up
and the new cars not ready yet.

344
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:05,130
It's a matter of whether or not
we can complete our cycle of,

345
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:05,401
of,

346
00:10:05,401 --> 00:10:07,620
of technology and artificial intelligence.

347
00:10:07,621 --> 00:10:10,440
And then combined with it
before we blow ourselves up,

348
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:10,931
you have very,

349
00:10:10,931 --> 00:10:11,860
very smart people.

350
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:12,390
Um,

351
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:12,640
uh,

352
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,570
reengineering,

353
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,280
reverse engineering the brain,

354
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:16,031
the eardrum,

355
00:10:16,031 --> 00:10:16,864
the eye,

356
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:17,890
the red blood cell.

357
00:10:17,891 --> 00:10:20,770
We just reverse engineered
the red blood cell of a dog.

358
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:25,120
And that means that if you reverse
engineer it and you know exactly how it

359
00:10:25,121 --> 00:10:25,391
works,

360
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:28,030
you can make a replica of
it with synthetic material.

361
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:28,550
Uh,

362
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:30,610
and which would be a
Nano Bot because it can,

363
00:10:30,611 --> 00:10:31,750
it's about that big.

364
00:10:31,751 --> 00:10:31,961
So,

365
00:10:31,961 --> 00:10:36,040
so pan on nanotechnology and then
re replicating what you just reverse

366
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:36,790
engineered.

367
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:37,960
If you can do that,

368
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:39,160
then it is.

369
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,770
It is clear and it follows up.

370
00:10:40,771 --> 00:10:41,081
By the way,

371
00:10:41,081 --> 00:10:43,660
we're also doing with an I
or doing it with an eardrum,

372
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,470
et cetera.

373
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:45,790
If you can do that well,

374
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:49,360
when is the brain when they're already
working on trying to reverse engineer the

375
00:10:49,361 --> 00:10:49,840
brain?

376
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,660
It really fucking is
really cool questions.

377
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,130
It really does,

378
00:10:54,131 --> 00:10:54,431
man,

379
00:10:54,431 --> 00:10:58,030
because if you can do that
and you can create a machine,

380
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,140
it's the blade runner question.

381
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:02,450
When does it become a person
you know when fucking,

382
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:04,060
what's her name and blade runner?

383
00:11:04,061 --> 00:11:05,800
The Really Daryl Hannah.

384
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:07,150
When she cried when she was sad.

385
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,430
Did you feel sad for her?

386
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,453
She's beautiful.

387
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,190
She's a robot robot robot.

388
00:11:11,191 --> 00:11:12,024
The want some deck.

389
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:12,873
That's right.

390
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,460
That's right.

391
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,293
You can kill you.

392
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:15,953
Ooh.

393
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,230
I'd like if you fuck a robot
that's really lifelike.

394
00:11:19,231 --> 00:11:19,980
Is that cheating?

395
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:20,480
Yes.

396
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,630
It's going to happen.

397
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,231
What's going to happen?

398
00:11:22,231 --> 00:11:24,270
Because the robot's going to go to your
house and kill your wife because your

399
00:11:24,271 --> 00:11:25,170
wife wants to unplug it.

400
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:26,980
Yeah.

401
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:27,870
Robots have emotions,

402
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,051
bro.

403
00:11:28,051 --> 00:11:28,771
They build them in.

404
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:29,670
If they build an emotion,

405
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,421
if they're going to build in,

406
00:11:30,421 --> 00:11:31,560
something's going to be kind to you.

407
00:11:31,561 --> 00:11:34,530
The only way kindness counts
is if you earn it kindness.

408
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:37,770
If you're just an emperor and you walk
in and everybody just sucks your Dick

409
00:11:37,771 --> 00:11:38,210
after awhile,

410
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:39,060
the chicken is boring.

411
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:41,610
You know the Yin and the Yang
of things is there for a reason.

412
00:11:41,611 --> 00:11:43,950
You have to have struggled in
order to appreciate the good times.

413
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:44,880
You cannot,

414
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,640
I don't appreciate relaxing
unless I put in hard work.

415
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:48,474
I really don't.

416
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,960
That's the biggest question was a lot of
computer scientists who are saying when

417
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,040
these robots will,

418
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:55,660
which means they,

419
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:56,501
when you say that,

420
00:11:56,501 --> 00:11:58,330
and when they develop consciousness,

421
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,090
meaning they are conscious
of their own existence,

422
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,870
the nature of anything that is conscious
of its own existence or even just

423
00:12:04,871 --> 00:12:06,010
having its own existence,

424
00:12:06,011 --> 00:12:08,440
whether it's a cancer cell
and aunt or a human being,

425
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,280
is that you want to replicate
and stay alive forever and,

426
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:13,360
and you know,

427
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:16,000
but those are biological
instincts because they're,

428
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:17,860
they're programmed into
the world that we operate.

429
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,120
We are creating,

430
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:22,900
computers are going to
be essentially the exact,

431
00:12:22,901 --> 00:12:23,734
the mimic.

432
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:26,020
We are mimicking ourselves,

433
00:12:26,021 --> 00:12:28,990
not necessarily true because
there's no benefit to staying alive.

434
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:29,640
What?

435
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,230
What benefit does the computer
have to maintain in consciousness?

436
00:12:32,231 --> 00:12:32,861
If there's no,

437
00:12:32,861 --> 00:12:37,720
if there's no cells or
genetics or hormones pumped
into your system telling you

438
00:12:37,721 --> 00:12:40,120
stick it in there and shoot off
loads because you want to breed.

439
00:12:40,121 --> 00:12:40,480
True.

440
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,171
What is,

441
00:12:41,171 --> 00:12:42,010
where's the incentive?

442
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,820
What happens does not the computer,

443
00:12:43,821 --> 00:12:45,100
if it's infinitely wise,

444
00:12:45,101 --> 00:12:48,430
doesn't embrace the notion that it does
not have to be a complete because what

445
00:12:48,431 --> 00:12:52,060
it is is a part of everything in the first
place and there's the idea of life is

446
00:12:52,061 --> 00:12:53,350
not really necessary.

447
00:12:53,351 --> 00:12:57,400
It's just we hold onto it because
biologically it's how we spread our work.

448
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,490
We spread our work and you're
never going to die anyway.

449
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,061
It doesn't matter.

450
00:13:01,061 --> 00:13:01,391
Anyways.

451
00:13:01,391 --> 00:13:02,740
The computer should be
smart enough to know,

452
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:02,980
go ahead.

453
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:03,850
Shut me off bitch.

454
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:04,900
That's I'm here forever.

455
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:05,171
Well,

456
00:13:05,171 --> 00:13:05,801
they had seen that.

457
00:13:05,801 --> 00:13:08,560
What about when they start
making computers that are
smarter than them and all

458
00:13:08,561 --> 00:13:08,980
that?

459
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:09,190
Well,

460
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:11,440
they become infinitely
smart almost immediately.

461
00:13:11,441 --> 00:13:12,520
I think that people always say,

462
00:13:12,521 --> 00:13:12,671
well,

463
00:13:12,671 --> 00:13:15,010
if they're going to have respect for our
biological heritage and what they don't

464
00:13:15,011 --> 00:13:16,450
realize that we're going
to be changing too.

465
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:17,970
That's what we're going
to be changing case.

466
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,700
I think when you start talking
about computers being this advanced,

467
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:24,160
you're talking about human beings
because I'm going to tell you right now,

468
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,300
as soon as they got a bio,

469
00:13:25,301 --> 00:13:26,134
chem,

470
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,270
bio compatible machine that I can
download information into et Cetera,

471
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:32,171
you're going to,

472
00:13:32,171 --> 00:13:35,950
you're going to have it in your body
attached already to my fucking phone.

473
00:13:35,951 --> 00:13:36,171
My,

474
00:13:36,171 --> 00:13:37,240
my phone is a part of me.

475
00:13:37,241 --> 00:13:39,100
When I leave my house and
I don't have my iPhone,

476
00:13:39,101 --> 00:13:41,110
I feel like I'm missing a part of my body.

477
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:41,891
And you know,

478
00:13:41,891 --> 00:13:43,210
if you read Tim Ferriss's book,

479
00:13:43,211 --> 00:13:45,430
did you read the part about having
a cell phone in your pocket?

480
00:13:45,431 --> 00:13:47,100
How it cooks your fucking ball?

481
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:47,471
Well,

482
00:13:47,471 --> 00:13:51,850
one of the things that he did was he did
a test on his sperm count and he did a

483
00:13:51,851 --> 00:13:55,360
test and found out that a sperm count
was fairly low and he's a really good

484
00:13:55,361 --> 00:13:56,770
shape and he's young and he was like,

485
00:13:56,771 --> 00:13:57,850
what the fuck is going on?

486
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,690
So then he starts doing all this reading
on different studies and one of the

487
00:14:01,691 --> 00:14:05,290
things he comes to his studies about
cell phone usage and keeping your cell

488
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:08,440
phone in your front pocket and
how it affects your sperm count.

489
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,760
The radiation from your fucking cell
phone diminishes your sperm count.

490
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:13,001
Yeah.

491
00:14:13,001 --> 00:14:14,410
He doesn't even carry it on him anymore.

492
00:14:14,411 --> 00:14:14,651
He like,

493
00:14:14,651 --> 00:14:16,490
he shuts it off and he
puts on his pocket and

494
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:18,460
speak.

495
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,293
I've always done anyway,

496
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:23,520
but I have it in my pocket all
the time and he said that he took,

497
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:24,730
took the time off,

498
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:26,420
stopped having the phone in his pocket.

499
00:14:26,421 --> 00:14:27,790
It started eating Brazil nuts.

500
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:31,390
Apparently they have zinc in them and
it's a very healthy for bringing back your

501
00:14:31,391 --> 00:14:34,060
sperm count in a misnomer
for everybody listening.

502
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,040
Brazil nuts can also be very,

503
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:36,671
very allergic.

504
00:14:36,671 --> 00:14:37,504
My mother will die.

505
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,130
My mother will die if she eats one.

506
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:39,850
If I,

507
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:40,930
if I want one,

508
00:14:40,931 --> 00:14:41,920
my whole throat closes.

509
00:14:41,921 --> 00:14:42,960
I'm going to eat some
right in front of you.

510
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:44,573
Brazil nuts.

511
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,053
Just make sure you're not,

512
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,013
you're not allergic.

513
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:48,820
Uh,

514
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:49,120
good,

515
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:49,590
good call.

516
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:49,841
Um,

517
00:14:49,841 --> 00:14:53,000
so either way I take zinc supplements
or do whatever the fuck is Ferris did.

518
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,490
And by taking the phone out of his pocket,

519
00:14:55,491 --> 00:14:55,980
he,

520
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:56,450
you know,

521
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:58,100
radically increase the sperm count.

522
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,230
That's scary.

523
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:00,063
It's a really good book.

524
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:01,363
What was that?

525
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:01,820
Oh,

526
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,560
that was in with that
in the second chapter.

527
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:04,100
I Dunno.

528
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:04,910
I Dunno what chapters did.

529
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:05,900
I read it on the toilet.

530
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,340
So I pick it up and I'll read it.

531
00:15:07,341 --> 00:15:08,240
For instance,

532
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:09,170
I've been eating so well,

533
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,940
my toilet trips have
been shorter and shorter.

534
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:12,051
I used to,

535
00:15:12,051 --> 00:15:12,321
you know,

536
00:15:12,321 --> 00:15:13,550
when I was just eating straight,

537
00:15:13,551 --> 00:15:14,760
meet Brock Lesnar status.

538
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:15,251
Oh,

539
00:15:15,251 --> 00:15:19,280
take these giant dinosaurs shits that
would take 20 minutes and I would look

540
00:15:19,281 --> 00:15:20,150
just like orange fears,

541
00:15:20,151 --> 00:15:22,190
jug out my legs would go numb,

542
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,390
my feet would go numb.

543
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,470
I'd have a hard time standing up,

544
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:25,371
but I've been,

545
00:15:25,371 --> 00:15:25,760
uh,

546
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,230
drinking this a Kale shake.

547
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:28,340
I make every morning now.

548
00:15:28,341 --> 00:15:28,610
Shit.

549
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:29,030
Yeah.

550
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:32,570
I cut it in this crazy Vitamix blender.

551
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:35,150
I throw in cucumbers and Kale and man,

552
00:15:35,151 --> 00:15:36,360
I feel so good.

553
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,850
You have so much energy.

554
00:15:37,851 --> 00:15:38,271
It's really,

555
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:38,440
it's,

556
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,273
it's amazing.

557
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:40,041
Cashews,

558
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:40,641
Goji Berries,

559
00:15:40,641 --> 00:15:41,474
some almonds,

560
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,081
strawberries,

561
00:15:42,081 --> 00:15:43,570
blueberries and uh,

562
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,230
some hemp seed and a,

563
00:15:45,231 --> 00:15:47,360
and protein powder and almond milk.

564
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,770
And you feel fucking,

565
00:15:48,771 --> 00:15:49,080
I mean,

566
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:49,430
I do it.

567
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:51,560
I do that Dr. Schultz Superfood,

568
00:15:51,561 --> 00:15:54,560
which is this awesome kelp
green thing I'm telling you,

569
00:15:54,561 --> 00:15:54,830
man.

570
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:55,940
I have energy for days.

571
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:56,900
It's just incredible.

572
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,240
Yeah,

573
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:57,501
man.

574
00:15:57,501 --> 00:15:58,810
Diet is so God damn report.

575
00:15:58,820 --> 00:15:59,653
And it's one of the things that,

576
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:00,650
and by the way,

577
00:16:00,651 --> 00:16:02,630
I know food tastes fucking delicious.

578
00:16:02,631 --> 00:16:03,280
You know,

579
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:03,550
I'm,

580
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,330
I'm the first guy after a comedy show,

581
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:05,811
especially,

582
00:16:05,811 --> 00:16:10,490
we'll go to canter's and I'll have a
giant fucking Pastrami Reuben with French

583
00:16:10,491 --> 00:16:11,031
fries.

584
00:16:11,031 --> 00:16:12,350
And you're getting the nutrition you need.

585
00:16:12,351 --> 00:16:13,800
Most people are walking
around and malnourished.

586
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:13,951
I,

587
00:16:13,951 --> 00:16:14,420
yes.

588
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,550
And then the shit food treats.

589
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,500
You got it.

590
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,011
And you're not,

591
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:20,150
not just vitamins either.

592
00:16:20,151 --> 00:16:21,950
I used to try to just do it with vitamins.

593
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:24,170
And I think multivitamins are important.

594
00:16:24,171 --> 00:16:26,000
I think it's important to recommend to,

595
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:27,140
I don't know if like,

596
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:27,860
you know,

597
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:31,670
I think certain people with certain
demands have higher demands.

598
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:32,870
Like especially if you're an athlete,

599
00:16:32,871 --> 00:16:34,160
if you're doing a lot of Jujitsu,

600
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,420
like when people say,

601
00:16:35,421 --> 00:16:37,120
you know what you need for a,

602
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:37,401
your,

603
00:16:37,401 --> 00:16:39,740
your recommended daily requirement
of vitamins and protein,

604
00:16:39,741 --> 00:16:40,574
all that stuff.

605
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,540
I always look at them and I go,

606
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:42,020
okay,

607
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,790
but what are you doing physical?

608
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:45,260
Are you doing what I'm doing man,

609
00:16:45,261 --> 00:16:46,760
because I'm fighting for my life?

610
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:47,151
You know,

611
00:16:47,151 --> 00:16:48,950
and I don't think people understand that.

612
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:49,341
You know,

613
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:49,911
I did a thing,

614
00:16:49,911 --> 00:16:50,420
I mean,

615
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,620
men's fitness this month,

616
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,000
there's a thing on my workout,

617
00:16:53,001 --> 00:16:53,211
you know,

618
00:16:53,211 --> 00:16:53,401
the,

619
00:16:53,401 --> 00:16:53,520
uh,

620
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,311
they did this whole,

621
00:16:54,311 --> 00:16:54,710
uh,

622
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:58,340
thing on my kettlebell workout and now
Steve Mack Walls Maxwell's in town and

623
00:16:58,341 --> 00:16:59,720
we'll working out this
weekend together too.

624
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:00,990
I'm super excited about that.

625
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:03,500
This week I'm going to do some
hardcore kettlebell drills.

626
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,820
People don't fucking realize how hard
some people work out and I don't work out

627
00:17:07,821 --> 00:17:10,190
nearly as hard as the guy
like Cain Velasquez does,

628
00:17:10,191 --> 00:17:11,600
or a guy like George Saint Pierre does.

629
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:14,540
I just simply don't put in the amount
of sessions in a week that they do.

630
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:15,950
But when I do do it,

631
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:20,270
I go fucking all out and you can't
do that and just eat spaghetti.

632
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:23,810
Now you can't do that and not have
vitamins and not have protein.

633
00:17:23,811 --> 00:17:24,500
And um,

634
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:28,550
I have one of the things that I've done
over the course of being involved in

635
00:17:28,551 --> 00:17:31,580
combat sports since I
was literally a child,

636
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:32,121
you know,

637
00:17:32,121 --> 00:17:32,430
um,

638
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:37,250
I haven't had a moment since I was 14
years old that I wasn't learning or

639
00:17:37,251 --> 00:17:38,810
practicing some type of martial art.

640
00:17:38,811 --> 00:17:42,590
It became an obsession super early
in my life and that there's a direct

641
00:17:42,591 --> 00:17:45,800
correlation to me with good performance,

642
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:46,910
good movement,

643
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,200
healthy body,

644
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:48,681
mind,

645
00:17:48,681 --> 00:17:49,080
spirit,

646
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,440
and Diet by when I've eaten
sheriff tillers talking about,

647
00:17:52,441 --> 00:17:52,741
I said,

648
00:17:52,741 --> 00:17:54,480
food is a drug and how you,

649
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,680
the way you combine it,

650
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,060
the kind of food you take in,

651
00:17:57,061 --> 00:18:00,090
it will react within your
body exactly the way a drug,

652
00:18:00,091 --> 00:18:00,420
well,

653
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:03,000
either it will have a
positive hormonal effect,

654
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:04,380
a negative hormonal.

655
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,880
The problem is good food.

656
00:18:05,881 --> 00:18:07,680
Like there's a lot of shit foods,

657
00:18:07,681 --> 00:18:07,971
food,

658
00:18:07,971 --> 00:18:09,750
it's got no or very little nutrients,

659
00:18:09,751 --> 00:18:11,280
but God damn it tastes good.

660
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:11,880
You know,

661
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,130
I have a pineapple and anchovy pizza.

662
00:18:14,131 --> 00:18:16,050
It's one of my big fucking problems.

663
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:16,951
I've got a problem.

664
00:18:16,951 --> 00:18:18,720
I like double and pineapple,

665
00:18:18,721 --> 00:18:19,590
double anchovies.

666
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:20,011
Sure.

667
00:18:20,011 --> 00:18:23,130
That's filled with arsenic and all kinds
of creepy fucking shit and that ocean,

668
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:26,490
that ocean is just filled with
heavy metal poisoning and a,

669
00:18:26,491 --> 00:18:26,970
anyway,

670
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:27,790
it's a fucking,

671
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:28,800
I got a real problem,

672
00:18:28,801 --> 00:18:29,820
but after I eat it,

673
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:31,770
I feel like shit.

674
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:35,610
I always feel like I got harpooned
like I got shot with some animal

675
00:18:35,611 --> 00:18:36,420
tranquilizer.

676
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:39,810
I think that the way that to start eating
better is first of all to to educate

677
00:18:39,811 --> 00:18:41,010
yourself and start eating better,

678
00:18:41,011 --> 00:18:43,350
but then just start
noticing the difference.

679
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:48,120
Because what happens is you start getting
a pleasurable response when you eat

680
00:18:48,121 --> 00:18:51,420
well and what's good for your body and
a negative response when you go out and

681
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:53,480
eat a whole pizza at
pizza or whatever you,

682
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:54,091
you,

683
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:54,570
you,

684
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:56,850
you won't feel as good
as if you have a shake.

685
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:57,780
I was just talking about it.

686
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:57,961
Well,

687
00:18:57,961 --> 00:18:59,130
my point was this was,

688
00:18:59,131 --> 00:18:59,851
this is my point.

689
00:18:59,851 --> 00:19:02,670
My point is in all my years
I've done it both ways.

690
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,300
I've done it where I eat shit food and
I've done it where I really good food and

691
00:19:06,301 --> 00:19:06,760
when I do,

692
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,710
when I really good food,

693
00:19:07,711 --> 00:19:08,640
I have a different body.

694
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,540
It's that simple.

695
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:10,860
It works way better.

696
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:11,820
It just works way better.

697
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:16,890
Nobody before they get into the UFC
eats fucking three Carls jr break bacon

698
00:19:16,891 --> 00:19:19,350
cheeseburgers and fries and a large coke.

699
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:20,850
You just don't do that because if you do,

700
00:19:20,851 --> 00:19:22,350
your body's going to perform like shit.

701
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,040
You know why?

702
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,990
Because your body is fighting off poison.

703
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:28,500
Your body is in a war to
process all this shit.

704
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:32,940
Saturated fats and trans fats
and those fats with Dick's,

705
00:19:32,941 --> 00:19:33,420
right Brian?

706
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,253
Yes.

707
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:35,881
He said,

708
00:19:35,881 --> 00:19:36,690
what's that?

709
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:37,523
I said,

710
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:42,200
I was just kidding about the
making out with the transvestite.

711
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:43,230
And my friends thought,

712
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:43,950
man,

713
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:44,370
you know,

714
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:45,330
somebody needs to,

715
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:50,900
somebody needs to create a guide for life
and have all these different ideas in

716
00:19:51,331 --> 00:19:51,630
there.

717
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:55,020
And one of them has got to be the
importance of diet and exercise.

718
00:19:55,021 --> 00:19:58,200
And even though I know a
lot of smart fucking people,

719
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:02,100
I know so many intelligent people who
are really super creative and really

720
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:03,960
interesting and they don't take
care of their fucking shell.

721
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,670
They don't take care of their body man.

722
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,061
They don't,

723
00:20:06,061 --> 00:20:07,440
they don't understand.

724
00:20:07,441 --> 00:20:11,190
And they'll look at you like
your a frivolous or like you're,

725
00:20:11,191 --> 00:20:11,680
you know,

726
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,020
you're,

727
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,420
there's a lot of negative connotation.

728
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:15,020
It's like when I call you a health nut,

729
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:16,020
oh,

730
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:19,350
you're a health nut or
you're an exercise freak.

731
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:19,561
Well,

732
00:20:19,561 --> 00:20:19,870
no,

733
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:21,540
you're narcissistic
because the inclination,

734
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:22,850
the implication.

735
00:20:22,851 --> 00:20:26,140
Now I just know that I feel way
better and way more productive when I,

736
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:26,730
when I'm,

737
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:27,840
when I'm like this,

738
00:20:27,841 --> 00:20:28,350
then I will,

739
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:30,180
I'm not going to have a
belly when I'm fucking,

740
00:20:30,181 --> 00:20:30,930
you know,

741
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:35,930
45 50 55 they say a certain percentage
of people who have chimpanzee DNA.

742
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:39,600
I have chimpanzee Danae I
mean not just chimpanzee DNA,

743
00:20:39,601 --> 00:20:40,770
rather neanderthal DNA.

744
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,670
There's no question about it.

745
00:20:41,671 --> 00:20:43,160
I got some of the on a tall in my past,

746
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,310
there's no doubt about it.

747
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:47,910
I this was like a certain percentage
of humans and large number.

748
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:48,730
Yeah.

749
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:51,400
We somehow or another assimilated
with the neanderthals.

750
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:54,790
They didn't use to think that they
take that now muscular like stronger.

751
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:55,291
I don't know.

752
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:55,511
No,

753
00:20:55,511 --> 00:20:58,120
I think you know that that has to
do with what part of environment,

754
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:58,391
you know,

755
00:20:58,391 --> 00:20:58,571
your,

756
00:20:58,571 --> 00:20:59,740
your DNA comes from,

757
00:20:59,741 --> 00:21:00,011
you know,

758
00:21:00,011 --> 00:21:05,011
whether you or your family were Sicilian
peasants that are carrying rocks all

759
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,273
day.

760
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:07,861
Exactly.

761
00:21:07,861 --> 00:21:08,191
And,

762
00:21:08,191 --> 00:21:12,580
and endomorphs seem to be a function
of society and in Diet and also the,

763
00:21:12,581 --> 00:21:16,180
one of the things they're finding
out is a stress from inside the womb.

764
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:16,970
If they're the,

765
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:17,340
the,

766
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:21,160
the mother during pregnancy
is malnourished in any way.

767
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:25,280
The kid has an inclination to hold on
to carbs and fats and they're like,

768
00:21:25,281 --> 00:21:25,960
oh yeah,

769
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,591
there's a,

770
00:21:26,591 --> 00:21:29,050
there was another part of that zeitgeists
thing that was really interesting.

771
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:29,600
It was a whole,

772
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,640
a lot of that that,

773
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:30,880
uh,

774
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,700
the Zike is the part that I watch the
only watch the first 15 minutes or so.

775
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:34,271
And,

776
00:21:34,271 --> 00:21:34,391
uh,

777
00:21:34,391 --> 00:21:36,640
what was really interesting about it
was all the different things they were

778
00:21:36,641 --> 00:21:37,211
talking about,

779
00:21:37,211 --> 00:21:39,200
about health and cancer and,

780
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,780
and illnesses and about,

781
00:21:40,781 --> 00:21:40,990
uh,

782
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:42,370
people who develop breast cancer.

783
00:21:42,371 --> 00:21:43,280
There's like a gene,

784
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,103
the,

785
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:47,860
a lot of people get breast cancer
and they can find that gene and say,

786
00:21:47,861 --> 00:21:49,120
you are susceptible to breast cancer.

787
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,770
People who have breast cancer,

788
00:21:50,771 --> 00:21:52,540
only three out of 10 have that gene.

789
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:54,550
Seven out of 10 don't have that gene.

790
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:55,150
You know,

791
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:55,720
and they're,

792
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,650
they're trying to figure out,

793
00:21:56,651 --> 00:21:56,801
well,

794
00:21:56,801 --> 00:21:58,930
what is it that causes
people to get cancer?

795
00:21:58,930 --> 00:21:59,201
What is,

796
00:21:59,201 --> 00:22:00,280
it causes people to be,

797
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,020
uh,

798
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:01,450
to,

799
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:03,250
to have a violent behavior?

800
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:03,701
Well,

801
00:22:03,701 --> 00:22:04,121
we'll,

802
00:22:04,121 --> 00:22:06,190
what are their genes for violent behavior?

803
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:06,401
Yes,

804
00:22:06,401 --> 00:22:06,850
there are,

805
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:07,130
but you know,

806
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:10,150
they're realizing people who've been
abused at childhood have a different

807
00:22:10,151 --> 00:22:11,110
genetic structure.

808
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,940
Then people haven't been in their body,

809
00:22:12,941 --> 00:22:14,530
their body reboots or jacks,

810
00:22:14,531 --> 00:22:18,280
your body triggers to structure can
change your body changes to deal with this

811
00:22:18,281 --> 00:22:22,390
horrible environment and this horrible
hand we live in dealt with evolution,

812
00:22:22,391 --> 00:22:23,224
immediate evolution.

813
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:24,323
It's like this,

814
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:29,110
the system is is all set up to respond
to whatever is coming in made sense

815
00:22:29,111 --> 00:22:29,291
though.

816
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:32,530
You know it's like I was talking to
John Brenkus who does that show sports

817
00:22:32,531 --> 00:22:35,770
science and they were talking
about feel Max and they were,

818
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:39,460
they tried to tire can't Velazco guys
out and they hadn't been running,

819
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:44,640
they couldn't get his heart rate over
165 a based no matter what they do,

820
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,240
you're fucking with that guy.

821
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:49,900
And some of it is that there's definitely
like some people have like a certain

822
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:52,690
genetic structure where they
can utilize oxygen better,

823
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,750
but a lot of it's,

824
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:54,000
it's,

825
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,000
it's also repetition and practice
and body kids incredibly adapt.

826
00:22:59,410 --> 00:22:59,561
Yeah.

827
00:22:59,561 --> 00:23:01,450
He wouldn't have that kind of
cardio if you didn't train.

828
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:03,370
I mean he's got definitely,

829
00:23:03,371 --> 00:23:04,510
he's got some freak genetics,

830
00:23:04,511 --> 00:23:06,100
but guess what a lot of Mexicans do.

831
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,230
A lot of Mexicans have amazing endurance.

832
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:12,370
You know Julio Cesar Chavez was known
for barely training and he had amazing

833
00:23:12,371 --> 00:23:13,690
endurance like at some of his fights.

834
00:23:13,691 --> 00:23:16,090
He like he would just come in and
just beat the fuck out of guys,

835
00:23:16,091 --> 00:23:17,750
break them down the
pace and you never done,

836
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,673
Gosh,

837
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,140
you just rake your body.

838
00:23:20,141 --> 00:23:20,320
Right.

839
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,920
I just saw a documentary on Gilbert
Melendez is the strike force lightweight

840
00:23:23,921 --> 00:23:24,311
champion.

841
00:23:24,311 --> 00:23:25,180
He's a Mexican dude.

842
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:26,350
Amazing endurance.

843
00:23:26,351 --> 00:23:27,184
His kid is,

844
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:30,820
he's known for just putting it on people
and he has even said that he thinks

845
00:23:30,821 --> 00:23:32,260
that part of his endurance is genetic.

846
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,320
Obviously works as hard as any
professional athlete on the planet,

847
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:39,520
but as long distance runners come
from Peru and so that's a different,

848
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,350
that's activity in Peru I'm saying.

849
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:41,740
Yeah,

850
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:42,610
but different activity,

851
00:23:42,611 --> 00:23:44,360
long distance running is all,

852
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,513
it's all,

853
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,280
it's a different,

854
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,230
it's a different kind of cardio that
you haven't fighting where you have

855
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,780
anaerobic and aerobic
all mixed in together.

856
00:23:50,781 --> 00:23:52,310
That's like real combat,

857
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:53,630
like sort of cardio.

858
00:23:53,631 --> 00:23:54,550
It's a different kind of cardio.

859
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,210
I asked me why I liked,

860
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,073
um,

861
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:01,600
why I love MMA so much that it's the Ross.

862
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,710
Was this a girl or a guy that
was asking this question?

863
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:06,310
If you did,

864
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:09,940
you grab her by the nape of the hair
in the back of her neck and you just,

865
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:12,960
just gently wrap your cock
or on their lips slop.

866
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:13,521
Hey guys,

867
00:24:13,521 --> 00:24:14,450
I got to get a spanking.

868
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:14,960
Okay.

869
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,890
And then put it back in your pants.

870
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:16,611
Don't even have a socket.

871
00:24:16,611 --> 00:24:17,780
Just put a bug in your parents just,

872
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:18,231
just to,

873
00:24:18,231 --> 00:24:21,110
just for the fuck out of her dirty bitch.

874
00:24:21,111 --> 00:24:22,030
Why do I like what?

875
00:24:22,031 --> 00:24:22,331
But it's,

876
00:24:22,331 --> 00:24:23,410
it's just so I got,

877
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,890
I just got a little bit
of a bonus just now,

878
00:24:24,891 --> 00:24:26,470
but it's,

879
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:27,710
it's literally like,

880
00:24:27,711 --> 00:24:29,420
it's the Ross form of competition.

881
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:30,283
Of course guys fight,

882
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:31,161
you know,

883
00:24:31,161 --> 00:24:31,610
um,

884
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:33,590
the movie warrior did
not get its fair shake.

885
00:24:33,591 --> 00:24:35,590
You were in warrior and
you had a great roles.

886
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:35,861
It was,

887
00:24:35,861 --> 00:24:36,710
it was a fun role,

888
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:38,450
but that movie did not get its fair shake.

889
00:24:38,451 --> 00:24:39,340
That was a great movie.

890
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,210
It wasn't even factual.

891
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:42,201
It was silly.

892
00:24:42,201 --> 00:24:45,050
They fought for two days in a row
and it was a little crazy tournament,

893
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:46,610
but that didn't matter.

894
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,880
The just the story itself and maybe
they could have worked around that where

895
00:24:49,881 --> 00:24:51,500
they didn't have a two day
tournament or whatever,

896
00:24:51,501 --> 00:24:55,160
but it didn't matter though
the story and the movie worked.

897
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,270
It was a good movie.

898
00:24:56,271 --> 00:24:56,460
It was.

899
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,260
It was decent.

900
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:59,570
It was great and a very few.

901
00:24:59,571 --> 00:25:03,200
What the fuck moments I like to do shows
nobody watches like death valley by the

902
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:04,034
way.

903
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:05,083
That's not tonight.

904
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:05,640
Tonight.

905
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,250
Monday at 11 nobody's watching it.

906
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:07,551
No,

907
00:25:07,551 --> 00:25:08,570
but it's a great show man.

908
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:10,580
Really funny to watch it tonight.

909
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:11,721
I told you I'll do it.

910
00:25:11,721 --> 00:25:12,800
I want to play a werewolf man.

911
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:13,581
You're going to,

912
00:25:13,581 --> 00:25:14,211
if we get picked up,

913
00:25:14,211 --> 00:25:14,841
I already talked to them.

914
00:25:14,841 --> 00:25:17,180
They loved the idea that
like Joe Rogan play Werewolf.

915
00:25:17,181 --> 00:25:17,960
It'd be awesome.

916
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,793
I'd love to play.

917
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:20,510
How good are the special effects?

918
00:25:20,511 --> 00:25:21,390
I don't want to play a tape.

919
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:23,120
I watched ginger snaps last night.

920
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:27,080
Somebody told me to rent ginger snaps
like dude's good mood werewolf movie.

921
00:25:27,081 --> 00:25:29,000
It's kind of funny for a long time.

922
00:25:29,001 --> 00:25:29,551
It's pretty fun.

923
00:25:29,551 --> 00:25:31,900
It's about two girls that are going
through high school and they're,

924
00:25:31,901 --> 00:25:32,601
they're loners,

925
00:25:32,601 --> 00:25:35,810
they're kind of outsiders and they're
sisters and they're kind of golf and one

926
00:25:35,811 --> 00:25:37,010
of them gets bit by a werewolf.

927
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,030
It's pretty fucking funny.

928
00:25:38,031 --> 00:25:42,020
There's a lot of good stuff to it up
until you see the Werewolf and it's like

929
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:43,251
Jesus Christ.

930
00:25:43,251 --> 00:25:44,480
Did you have any budget?

931
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:45,231
I mean it's just,

932
00:25:45,231 --> 00:25:50,231
it looks like they take a balloon and
drew a Werewolf scary face on the blue and

933
00:25:50,451 --> 00:25:51,350
stuck it in your face.

934
00:25:51,351 --> 00:25:52,270
Like that's the wolf man.

935
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,210
So bad.

936
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:56,670
A great special effects man.

937
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:57,620
I'm proud of the show.

938
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,491
I really am.

939
00:25:58,491 --> 00:25:59,324
I think it's really funny.

940
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:00,800
And it's on MTV.

941
00:26:00,801 --> 00:26:01,634
What time?

942
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:03,640
11 o'clock on Monday tonight.

943
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,030
Watch it tonight.

944
00:26:05,031 --> 00:26:10,031
Schedule it on my phone right now and
I think tomorrow we got Josh McDermitt.

945
00:26:10,971 --> 00:26:13,970
Josh supposed to be doing it because we
started doing this thing from the Ice

946
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:16,070
House live at the Ice House and it's on,

947
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:18,290
it's broken up into two parts.

948
00:26:18,291 --> 00:26:21,380
One part is on my iTunes,

949
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,700
on the Joe Rogan experience.

950
00:26:22,701 --> 00:26:27,290
And the other part is on desk squad and
a desk squad is the one that Brian runs.

951
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:28,880
And what it essentially is,

952
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:29,481
is,

953
00:26:29,481 --> 00:26:29,930
um,

954
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:33,200
it's all of our friends that have
podcasts like Thompson Guerra.

955
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:33,831
We're talking,

956
00:26:33,831 --> 00:26:35,000
Brian counted doing one.

957
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,070
He's going to do one now too.

958
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:36,300
Yes,

959
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,180
I am Sam triple.

960
00:26:37,181 --> 00:26:38,750
He does it all these
different people do it.

961
00:26:38,751 --> 00:26:40,270
And we decided to,

962
00:26:40,271 --> 00:26:40,470
uh,

963
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:43,070
that would be a good way to
also promote death squads.

964
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:43,950
We have it set up.

965
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,390
I'm going to do it on that red bands.

966
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:46,603
Uh,

967
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:47,430
that's fine yet.

968
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:48,390
And we start Brendan Walsh,

969
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:48,731
uh,

970
00:26:48,731 --> 00:26:49,240
this week too.

971
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,080
I think what I'm gonna start
my podcast just going to be,

972
00:26:51,081 --> 00:26:51,590
I'm going to say,

973
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:52,080
I'm going to have,

974
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,260
I guess I'm just gonna ask them
like 10 really good questions.

975
00:26:55,261 --> 00:26:56,250
I've always wanted to do that,

976
00:26:56,251 --> 00:26:56,431
man.

977
00:26:56,431 --> 00:26:57,370
You're a conversationalist.

978
00:26:57,371 --> 00:26:58,650
Just anything that's interesting to you.

979
00:26:58,651 --> 00:27:00,010
Just sit down and talk
about it though there.

980
00:27:00,011 --> 00:27:00,201
Yeah,

981
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:00,871
but you,

982
00:27:00,871 --> 00:27:02,070
you should have a podcast.

983
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:02,970
There's no doubt about it.

984
00:27:02,971 --> 00:27:04,830
You're a fascinating dude and you know,

985
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:05,980
and it's going to be fun in it.

986
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:10,050
It helps you evolve ideas and people call
you on your bullshit and it helps you.

987
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:13,860
It also helps you realize like how many
times you repeat the same things over

988
00:27:13,861 --> 00:27:14,700
and over again.

989
00:27:14,701 --> 00:27:15,270
How many,

990
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:19,020
how many subjects you obsess on it and
it becomes a normal part of your everyday

991
00:27:19,021 --> 00:27:19,440
life.

992
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,390
But when you start trying
to pump that on a podcast,

993
00:27:21,391 --> 00:27:21,691
people like,

994
00:27:21,691 --> 00:27:22,140
look bitch,

995
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:22,973
I heard that already.

996
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:26,430
Stop fucking freaking out about
the same thing every God damn week.

997
00:27:26,431 --> 00:27:26,850
You know,

998
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:28,080
you gotta you gotta evolve.

999
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:28,490
Yeah.

1000
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:31,080
Well we talked about occupy Wall
Street like three times in a row now,

1001
00:27:31,081 --> 00:27:32,430
but I think we're,

1002
00:27:32,431 --> 00:27:35,700
we're also doing it with different
people just sort of get their different

1003
00:27:35,701 --> 00:27:38,610
reactions because I think this is a pretty
important part of human history right

1004
00:27:38,611 --> 00:27:38,850
now.

1005
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:42,180
I think it's funny that you both
said that you really like Daniel Day.

1006
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:43,650
What's his name is Daniel Day Lewis.

1007
00:27:43,651 --> 00:27:44,130
Yeah,

1008
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:47,670
cause it's that comes up with all
your friends and industry guys.

1009
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:48,543
I'll sitting out here.

1010
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:49,920
We're going out and talking about,

1011
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,233
yeah,

1012
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:54,120
I guess it comes down to it.

1013
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:55,740
Every time I do knuckles up,

1014
00:27:55,741 --> 00:27:56,101
by the way,

1015
00:27:56,101 --> 00:27:58,180
I can't get you out of my
head so it kind of sucks.

1016
00:27:59,280 --> 00:27:59,870
Materialize.

1017
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:02,490
Feels like it comes down to like people.

1018
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,700
What inspires you is not even so
much the person but the effort.

1019
00:28:05,701 --> 00:28:10,701
You know like when you see that kind of
like holy fuck you go beyond yourself

1020
00:28:11,251 --> 00:28:11,490
there.

1021
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:12,480
I don't really like soccer,

1022
00:28:12,481 --> 00:28:15,510
but if I see a bad ass soccer player
and the show me a clip online,

1023
00:28:15,511 --> 00:28:16,021
I'll watch him.

1024
00:28:16,021 --> 00:28:17,010
I'll watch him do his thing.

1025
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:20,460
Did you see that guy by the way in
South Africa riding his mountain bike,

1026
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:22,520
his doors and he got hit by that?

1027
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:23,643
I answer low.

1028
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:24,420
Yeah.

1029
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:28,140
You get hit by a buck with the horns and
then he landed on his head and it was

1030
00:28:28,141 --> 00:28:28,561
making those,

1031
00:28:28,561 --> 00:28:29,880
I've been knocked out noises like,

1032
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:35,790
oh this is that you make when
you get severely concussed,

1033
00:28:35,791 --> 00:28:37,420
that's when you know that's when you know.

1034
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:41,940
Also you feel that weight and power
of a 440 pounds and running full clip

1035
00:28:41,941 --> 00:28:43,490
hitting you with it's fucking horns.

1036
00:28:43,491 --> 00:28:45,690
No fuck are they just kept running.

1037
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,110
He just,

1038
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:47,311
Oh,

1039
00:28:47,311 --> 00:28:47,731
whoops.

1040
00:28:47,731 --> 00:28:49,440
I hit a guy and a bike.

1041
00:28:49,441 --> 00:28:50,274
No big deal.

1042
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:51,450
Accident or was he trying,

1043
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:51,840
no,

1044
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,381
it was an accident.

1045
00:28:52,381 --> 00:28:53,190
He was running.

1046
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:57,000
He happened to be sprinting and as they're
coming down and he just timed it shit

1047
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,800
and slammed into him.

1048
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,673
Yeah.

1049
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:00,751
Fuck Africa,

1050
00:29:00,751 --> 00:29:01,021
dude.

1051
00:29:01,021 --> 00:29:05,430
Africa can suck my dick insects
the size of your fucking forearms.

1052
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,510
How about the parasites?

1053
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:08,310
Forget about the insects that you can see.

1054
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,001
How about,

1055
00:29:09,001 --> 00:29:09,211
oh,

1056
00:29:09,211 --> 00:29:09,541
whoops.

1057
00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:13,680
I washed my toe and I actually
had a hangnail and some
shit got inside of it and

1058
00:29:13,681 --> 00:29:17,280
it camped out in my body and grew and
made a chain all the way to my brain and

1059
00:29:17,281 --> 00:29:20,340
it started sucking brain juice out of
my big toe and I went to the doctor's

1060
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:20,461
like,

1061
00:29:20,461 --> 00:29:21,690
why is my big toe leaking?

1062
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:21,901
Oh,

1063
00:29:21,901 --> 00:29:23,100
that's cerebral spinal fluid.

1064
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:23,280
How?

1065
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,200
What the fuck's going on?

1066
00:29:24,201 --> 00:29:26,820
Or there's a pipeline between your
fucking brain and your toe created by some

1067
00:29:26,821 --> 00:29:27,390
parasite.

1068
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:27,780
No,

1069
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:29,370
maybe I just made it up.

1070
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,040
But maybe it could be true.

1071
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:34,020
There's plenty of shit inside
Africa that can Africa twice.

1072
00:29:34,021 --> 00:29:34,651
Fuck you up.

1073
00:29:34,651 --> 00:29:36,000
I remember I was saying I was a kid,

1074
00:29:36,001 --> 00:29:36,631
I was an African.

1075
00:29:36,631 --> 00:29:36,990
It was,

1076
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:38,130
it was dark out and there were the,

1077
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:40,260
we were staying at his place
where there were the grounds,

1078
00:29:40,261 --> 00:29:40,990
there were these,

1079
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:44,050
you could walk around and I was going
to walk around and my father goes,

1080
00:29:44,051 --> 00:29:44,261
you know,

1081
00:29:44,261 --> 00:29:45,700
walking around there or why this,

1082
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:46,630
cause this is Africa.

1083
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:47,800
You see a fence around here.

1084
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:49,630
There are lion just over there.

1085
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:50,493
You idiot

1086
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:52,930
rice.

1087
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:54,550
You don't have a dog in your backyard.

1088
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:55,840
In Africa for example,

1089
00:29:55,930 --> 00:30:00,520
we've been banging around
the idea of a cell phones.

1090
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:02,050
How when you buy a cell phone,

1091
00:30:02,051 --> 00:30:02,291
you know,

1092
00:30:02,291 --> 00:30:05,350
you don't realize how much fucking slave
labor is involved and how much we were.

1093
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:07,150
Is there a Karma free cell phone?

1094
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:10,930
Is there a cell phone you can buy where
you don't have to worry about the Labor

1095
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,160
being slave labor?

1096
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:14,620
You don't have to worry about
the minerals mind under,

1097
00:30:14,621 --> 00:30:14,951
you know,

1098
00:30:14,951 --> 00:30:17,410
treacherous conditions where
people know it's impossible.

1099
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,070
It's impossible.

1100
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:18,580
Sorry.

1101
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:19,211
Those minerals,

1102
00:30:19,211 --> 00:30:22,380
they're all from the fucking Congo man
and the con that was watching vice guide

1103
00:30:22,381 --> 00:30:22,901
to the Congo.

1104
00:30:22,901 --> 00:30:23,734
Have you seen that yet?

1105
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,690
They started releasing
vice guy to the Congo.

1106
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:30,370
Oh Jesus Christ is out of
fucking crazy part of the world.

1107
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:30,731
That is,

1108
00:30:30,731 --> 00:30:31,830
you actually watch it.

1109
00:30:31,831 --> 00:30:36,831
A hell on earth or some of those villages
chose more than Mad Max Joseph Kahn,

1110
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:37,991
Joseph Kony,

1111
00:30:37,991 --> 00:30:39,700
who runs the Lord's Resistance Army,

1112
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:43,450
about 200 300 like vicious killers who
do all kinds of horrible things and they

1113
00:30:43,451 --> 00:30:44,110
just go to,

1114
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:45,280
they just mask or villages.

1115
00:30:45,281 --> 00:30:47,920
He's a delusional guy with
military grade weapons.

1116
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:53,070
It's been out there for God since the
Hutu Rwanda massacre and this motherfucker

1117
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:58,410
is as bad as it gets and they do
the worst shit in recorded history.

1118
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:03,760
It's going on right now in 2011 people
don't realize that millions of people

1119
00:31:03,761 --> 00:31:04,594
have died.

1120
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:06,251
Millions,

1121
00:31:06,251 --> 00:31:06,660
millions.

1122
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,200
That sounds like an exaggeration,

1123
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:12,940
but it's more that civil war
has seen that Sierra Leone,

1124
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:15,850
Liberia to us to a small extent,

1125
00:31:15,851 --> 00:31:16,031
but,

1126
00:31:16,031 --> 00:31:16,191
and,

1127
00:31:16,191 --> 00:31:20,980
and Rwanda has seen some of the most
concentrated and ferocious killing in the

1128
00:31:20,981 --> 00:31:22,530
history of the fucking world.

1129
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:25,060
Whoever you guys are the do
that vice guide to travel.

1130
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:28,840
All you guys are bad motherfuckers and
I would love to have you guys on the

1131
00:31:28,841 --> 00:31:31,570
podcast if someone knows
anybody that knows those guys.

1132
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:32,441
Somebody does.

1133
00:31:32,441 --> 00:31:33,640
If somebody knows one of the guys on the,

1134
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:34,421
on our message board,

1135
00:31:34,421 --> 00:31:35,920
but fucking Holler at me on Twitter.

1136
00:31:35,921 --> 00:31:36,520
Those,

1137
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,061
those guys,

1138
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:37,360
uh,

1139
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,070
they've done some wild fucking trips.

1140
00:31:39,071 --> 00:31:39,251
Man.

1141
00:31:39,251 --> 00:31:40,870
The Liberia one is a great one.

1142
00:31:40,871 --> 00:31:41,710
The Thailand one,

1143
00:31:41,711 --> 00:31:43,560
they went to Thailand
and picked up lady boys.

1144
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:44,690
Woo.

1145
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:45,270
Wow.

1146
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,103
They went deep.

1147
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,670
I saw the lady boys,

1148
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:51,010
their hangover too,

1149
00:31:51,011 --> 00:31:51,371
right?

1150
00:31:51,371 --> 00:31:51,650
Derek?

1151
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:52,090
Zach,

1152
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:53,680
and I know I that I was with Zach Alf,

1153
00:31:53,681 --> 00:31:54,131
an accident.

1154
00:31:54,131 --> 00:31:54,671
Brody Stevens,

1155
00:31:54,671 --> 00:31:58,570
and we were watching the lady boys and
some of them are as good looking as the

1156
00:31:58,571 --> 00:32:00,580
girl I was making out with
from my earlier story,

1157
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:01,720
better,

1158
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,201
softer,

1159
00:32:02,201 --> 00:32:02,520
less.

1160
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,490
And I said to Brody,

1161
00:32:03,491 --> 00:32:03,821
I go,

1162
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:04,121
dude,

1163
00:32:04,121 --> 00:32:05,320
if you have any guts at all,

1164
00:32:05,321 --> 00:32:05,680
you will,

1165
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,660
you will take that girl home and bang her.

1166
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:08,650
I know it's a guy,

1167
00:32:08,651 --> 00:32:09,910
but you don't have the stones.

1168
00:32:09,911 --> 00:32:10,691
Of course he didn't do it,

1169
00:32:10,691 --> 00:32:13,300
but she was like go or just go,

1170
00:32:13,301 --> 00:32:14,020
wow.

1171
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:14,853
Wow.

1172
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:16,930
Scary world out there.

1173
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:18,160
Just like Thailand.

1174
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:19,120
Did you think you could leave?

1175
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:22,840
Leave the country and me and
you and a couple of other dudes,

1176
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:23,703
this is the thing,

1177
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,200
we hit 60 after the kids are grown,

1178
00:32:26,201 --> 00:32:27,034
kids leave the house.

1179
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:28,120
We were trying to fucking the,

1180
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:29,500
and we just get to a
certain point where like,

1181
00:32:29,501 --> 00:32:30,251
listen baby,

1182
00:32:30,251 --> 00:32:30,940
I love you.

1183
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:31,391
You love me.

1184
00:32:31,391 --> 00:32:33,150
I'm just gonna live in Thailand
for four months out of the year.

1185
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:35,210
That's how I got myself
a young girl's tough.

1186
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,071
Four months of the year,

1187
00:32:36,071 --> 00:32:36,850
eight months of the year,

1188
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:39,680
I'll stay with China on an 18 year old
a lot to me and telling me I still have

1189
00:32:39,681 --> 00:32:39,910
it.

1190
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:41,330
Do whatever you need to
do with your trainer.

1191
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:41,780
I know,

1192
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:42,230
you know,

1193
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:44,330
I don't want to control you in any way,

1194
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,590
just make it happen.

1195
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:46,371
And he just give up.

1196
00:32:46,371 --> 00:32:48,770
When you go to fucking
Thailand and live like a king,

1197
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:50,480
then you see this,

1198
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:54,820
this German tourist with
warts and barnacles on his
back and hot little tigers,

1199
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,500
durable like 18 year old
pretending she's into him.

1200
00:32:57,501 --> 00:33:00,560
It's enough to make you throw up and
give you a boner at the same time.

1201
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:01,394
Ladies and gentlemen,

1202
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:02,241
by the way,

1203
00:33:02,241 --> 00:33:03,260
I'll be covered at all.

1204
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,170
We've covered it a little bit.

1205
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,023
Winnepeg.

1206
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:06,733
Let me segue.

1207
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:07,611
I'll be at a,

1208
00:33:07,611 --> 00:33:08,421
I think it's rumors.

1209
00:33:08,421 --> 00:33:11,750
I think it's called rumors at Winnipeg
and I'll be this weekend and Winnipeg is

1210
00:33:11,751 --> 00:33:12,650
an awesome name.

1211
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:15,693
I started,

1212
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:18,320
have you done Calgary?

1213
00:33:18,321 --> 00:33:22,460
I'm doing Calgary did Calgary
and we oversold the show,

1214
00:33:22,461 --> 00:33:24,020
so I had a hundred
people on stage with me.

1215
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:25,123
It was fun.

1216
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,950
I had people on either side of me
while I was on stage and cheers.

1217
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:28,901
No,

1218
00:33:28,901 --> 00:33:28,971
no,

1219
00:33:28,971 --> 00:33:29,061
no.

1220
00:33:29,061 --> 00:33:30,070
I did a theater of it all.

1221
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:30,711
I'm doing Yuck,

1222
00:33:30,711 --> 00:33:31,544
Yuck,

1223
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:32,661
Yuck,

1224
00:33:32,661 --> 00:33:32,871
yuck.

1225
00:33:32,871 --> 00:33:34,790
Sit in Calgary and Winnipeg this weekend.

1226
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:36,620
I've only done Yuk yuks in Vancouver,

1227
00:33:36,621 --> 00:33:37,850
but it's not Yuk yuks anymore.

1228
00:33:37,851 --> 00:33:38,690
It's another name now,

1229
00:33:38,691 --> 00:33:39,650
but it's still dope ass.

1230
00:33:39,651 --> 00:33:41,120
A little club in Vancouver,

1231
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:45,043
Canada.

1232
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,100
I love the people.

1233
00:33:46,101 --> 00:33:47,960
I love 20% less douchebags in America.

1234
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:51,580
Great people fighting people nice as fuck.

1235
00:33:51,581 --> 00:33:54,170
I wished it didn't get so cold
up there and they get the funny,

1236
00:33:54,171 --> 00:33:55,004
they get it.

1237
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:56,031
They're smart.

1238
00:33:56,031 --> 00:33:57,410
I want to move the federal educated,

1239
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,640
move the fuck out about that.

1240
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,350
Generally better educated than Americans.

1241
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:05,360
Better specialist in like Toronto
and Vancouver and Montreal.

1242
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:05,541
Yeah,

1243
00:34:05,541 --> 00:34:06,740
so it was Montreal though.

1244
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:07,510
They're amazing.

1245
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:08,343
I love Montreal.

1246
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:09,290
That's the end of the show.

1247
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,273
The fuck.

1248
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:11,840
I don't know any other way to end it.

1249
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,120
That's it.

1250
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:14,953
Thank you very much.

1251
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:16,280

They were great to fucking talking about.

1266
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:44,000
Why are you apologizing?

1267
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,230
Don't apologize for being yourself,

1268
00:34:45,231 --> 00:34:45,690
dude.

1269
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:47,050

You should never change a
God damn thing about you.

1274
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:53,090

1279
00:34:57,531 --> 00:34:58,580
You need to meet this guy.

1280

We appreciate all you people listening
on your fucking treadmills and your cars

1311
00:35:39,061 --> 00:35:40,260
and your gyms in your life,

1312
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:41,430
in your home while you're cooking.

1313
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,750
Whatever the fuck you're doing.

1314
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:43,920
We're with you bitches.

1315
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:49,070
It's a movement or all
together in this jihad.

1316
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:53,520
Did you watch the Walmart Kadafi videos
and beating him up and putting a stick

1317
00:35:53,521 --> 00:35:54,354
in his ass?

1318
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:54,631
Yeah,

1319
00:35:54,631 --> 00:35:55,830
they stuffed sticks in his ass.

1320
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:57,300
I recommend it.

1321
00:35:57,330 --> 00:35:58,910
They show him beating the shit out of him.

1322
00:35:58,920 --> 00:35:59,581
He wasn't bloody.

1323
00:35:59,581 --> 00:36:02,180
And then he became bloody
and they killed him.

1324
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:04,590
They beat the fuck out of him and killed
him and they don't show the video of

1325
00:36:04,591 --> 00:36:05,130
them killing them,

1326
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:05,790
unfortunately.

1327
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:07,380
Pussies you showed everything else.

1328
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:09,580
Pray to them around on top
of a car with she on them.

1329
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:11,850
It's the fucking shows ending right now.

1330
00:36:11,851 --> 00:36:13,350
And I'm going into another subject.

1331
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:14,850
Thank you to everybody.

1332
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:15,210
Uh,

1333
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:17,340
and we will see you tomorrow.

1334
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:17,701
Anything else,

1335
00:36:17,701 --> 00:36:18,000
Brian?

1336
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:18,121
Oh,

1337
00:36:18,121 --> 00:36:20,450
subscribe to the desk
squad series of podcasts.

1338
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:25,110
A homie made it into the top fucking
10 this week for the first time ever.

1339
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:27,990
I will be on that podcast
because of a gimmick.

1340
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:28,231
We,

1341
00:36:28,231 --> 00:36:28,680
but we,

1342
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,220
we got ya.

1343
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:29,730
Anyway.

1344
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:30,563
You're right.

1345
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:31,480
You fucks.

1346
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:31,741
All right.

1347
00:36:31,741 --> 00:36:32,350
We love you guys.

1348
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:32,970
We'll see you soon.

1349
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:33,803
Thank you very much.

1350
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:38,920
Okay.
