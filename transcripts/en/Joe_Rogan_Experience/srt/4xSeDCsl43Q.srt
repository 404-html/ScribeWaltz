1
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:11,120
This podcast will be a mess.
Just prepare yourself.

2
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:14,360
If you're an MMA journalist,
put you're a gate.

3
00:00:14,361 --> 00:00:16,220
You're weightlifting chalk on your 
hands.

4
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:21,770
Get ready bitches.
I'm full of opinions.

5
00:00:21,771 --> 00:00:26,771
Everybody had those fucking keyboards.
This is essentially sort of a preview of

6
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:31,640
this weekend's fights are really just a 
chance to get together and fuck around.

7
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:36,770
I was telling him was a breakdown.
He was told to breakdown.

8
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:39,500
I've studied all night for a break.
I have my notes.

9
00:00:39,501 --> 00:00:42,390
I was told this is a breakdown.
What are your thoughts,

10
00:00:42,391 --> 00:00:43,520
sir?
I'm glad you asked.

11
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:46,790
I'm going to go with a.
asked me,

12
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:47,660
asked me.
Well,

13
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,110
I'm going to go with Nate Diaz now asked
me,

14
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,440
wow,
well,

15
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,270
the way I look at it,
and correct me if I'm wrong,

16
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,193
Connor's boxed.
The daylights had everybody who for the 

17
00:00:57,291 --> 00:01:00,110
most part either has his reach or 
smallest.

18
00:01:00,111 --> 00:01:01,790
When he does,
he hangs on the edge of the pocket.

19
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,340
He hangs in the age of the pocket and 
he's a counter puncher.

20
00:01:04,341 --> 00:01:06,620
Weights to you,
commit slips and hits.

21
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:08,720
He's dealing with something very 
different with nate,

22
00:01:08,721 --> 00:01:09,554
which is that nate is longer and taller 
and nate doesn't have to do that and I 

23
00:01:12,711 --> 00:01:13,544
wonder what he's going to have to do is 
either one of two things is going to 

24
00:01:15,891 --> 00:01:20,450
have to weave and get inside or because 
nate stands so you know,

25
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,570
flat,
I mean sort of squares up with you.

26
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,990
I guess you could back kick in front 
kick is his body,

27
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,840
but connor doesn't kick like it's not 
what you think.

28
00:01:29,841 --> 00:01:30,890
Well,
watch out for connor.

29
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,780
Connor's a heart kicks,
you know what I mean?

30
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:36,690
So he actually takes pretty good kid.
Very good kid.

31
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:37,543
He does.
I haven't seen much of him because he's 

32
00:01:38,591 --> 00:01:41,740
smoking everyone,
but native,

33
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:42,583
very durable guy too.
He spends a lot of time in those gyms 

34
00:01:44,991 --> 00:01:48,230
with a lot of those Mexican boxers that 
stand in the hole and just bang,

35
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:49,130
which is encounter.

36
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:50,760
It's not but I.
But I,

37
00:01:50,761 --> 00:01:51,594
I wonder how common is going to actually
have to change a little bit of his 

38
00:01:53,661 --> 00:01:55,760
boxing and I'm curious to see how he 
does.

39
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:56,683
He's only fought one guy that's tall.
That's Max Holloway and he's 

40
00:01:58,820 --> 00:01:59,653
coincidentally the one guy that went to 
a decision with him and he was also 

41
00:02:01,641 --> 00:02:02,474
hurting that he hurt his knee in that 
fight during the fight when he was 

42
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:07,310
passing the guard,
he blew out his acl,

43
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:11,750
so that definitely had a huge,
huge effect,

44
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,420
but I think that you make some good 
points.

45
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:19,600
I think a dos Anjos showed a bit of the 
blueprint on how to beat nate and one of

46
00:02:20,031 --> 00:02:23,660
the big things is that nate stance real 
heavy on that front leg.

47
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,850
He comes in,
he fires that hard,

48
00:02:25,851 --> 00:02:26,684
right jab and stands real heavy on that 
front leg and dos Anjos just lift that 

49
00:02:30,171 --> 00:02:31,004
leg up.
He lit his legs up and because of that 

50
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:36,320
boxing centered style,
me nate will throw the occasional kick,

51
00:02:36,321 --> 00:02:40,310
but primarily he fights boxing when he's
fighting his boxing.

52
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,530
Very good.
It is very sharp.

53
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:46,660
He boxed up gray maynard.
He boxed up Marcus Davis and Michael.

54
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:48,290
Josh Thompson,
Michael Johnson.

55
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:49,910
His last fight was one of his best 
fight.

56
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:50,803
Unbelievable.
Josh Thompson head kicked and knocked 

57
00:02:51,981 --> 00:02:52,814
him out,
right?

58
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,680
Yeah.
That was a different.

59
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:56,990
That was Josh Thompson,
man.

60
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,060
I'd do a 10.
It's a series of injuries,

61
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,070
but I still maintain

62
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,780
he's one of the best lightweight in the 
world,

63
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:03,460
especially when it was in strikeforce.
Yeah,

64
00:03:03,461 --> 00:03:04,670
well he's getting older.
That's the.

65
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:08,020
The issue is he's like 36 years old.
That's all it is.

66
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:08,830
Yeah.
Yeah.

67
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:09,663
I mean,
do you think that Matt Connors met 

68
00:03:10,631 --> 00:03:14,100
anyone yet who's has got a boxer?
A snake because no good.

69
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:16,870
Maybe Max,
maybe Max.

70
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:19,050
Right.
But Max back then was like,

71
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:19,913
it was two,
two years ago plus Max was not as good 

72
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:25,810
as he is now.
Confident Max is on fire right now.

73
00:03:25,811 --> 00:03:28,750
Max Holloway is on fire.
I'd like to see him and conor fight.

74
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,830
Fight.
Fuck yeah.

75
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:32,883
See I don't know about that,
but I don't think that conor really 

76
00:03:35,051 --> 00:03:37,330
wants that 1:45
weight class anymore.

77
00:03:37,331 --> 00:03:40,300
I mean he looks so big right now.
He has it and I think,

78
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:44,250
I think at 55 fighting dose Angeles,
that's the fight at UFC 200.

79
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:47,380
So if he gets past it actually is kind 
of interesting.

80
00:03:47,381 --> 00:03:49,390
If he gets past Nadya's,
you know,

81
00:03:49,391 --> 00:03:52,860
because it makes that fight bigger.
The fight at 200,

82
00:03:52,861 --> 00:03:54,610
it really makes it more build up,
you know,

83
00:03:54,611 --> 00:03:55,444
dos Anjos broke his foot in the last 
minute of the last round of sparring to 

84
00:03:59,020 --> 00:03:59,853
a huge.
He's going to get the high level a 

85
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,930
kickboxer and check the kid broke his 
foot,

86
00:04:03,931 --> 00:04:06,940
but we use the same as seuss and of 
course you know,

87
00:04:06,941 --> 00:04:08,530
I get the text message,
it's like fuck,

88
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,350
this happened exactly last minute,
last round kind of thing.

89
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,600
That's the thing though.
That's the kings.

90
00:04:13,601 --> 00:04:14,690
They go hard,
man.

91
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,890
They're so good.
Do they were what's like a Shin Pad?

92
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:18,724
So it's over it.
But if your heart and a kickbox is 

93
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:24,430
checking it,
you kick as hard as he does and you kick

94
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:26,470
a tree.
You got to fucking break your foot.

95
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,333
Let's see.
I think we know what Nate Diaz is gonna 

96
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,380
bring to the table.
I think connor knows.

97
00:04:32,381 --> 00:04:34,240
I think everyone in this room knows what
he's going to do.

98
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:36,220
We don't know what Congress really going
to do.

99
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,170
Really haven't seen all his tools.
Man.

100
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:39,123
I think Diaz is the perfect match up so 
he can showcase all his tools because 

101
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,340
Diaz isn't easy.
I don't think he's gonna get murdered in

102
00:04:45,341 --> 00:04:46,174
the first round.
We're going to see a lot of connor and 

103
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:48,124
what he brings to the table for connor's
really good at lowering you with those 

104
00:04:51,671 --> 00:04:56,671
kicks and then stepping in with that big
lefthand had left hand is just a monster

105
00:04:56,891 --> 00:04:59,350
punch from heaven.
Oh Man.

106
00:04:59,351 --> 00:05:02,410
He just throws it so perfect and he's 
got so much power behind it,

107
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:05,750
but I'll tell you man,
it's hard to hit nate Diaz.

108
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:08,290
Clean Heart and clean.
He's tall,

109
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:09,603
he's slick.

110
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,700
He just moves a lot.
You know?

111
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,350
It's hard because it's.
His range is good.

112
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:16,540
He's also good at ducking under shit.
You know,

113
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:18,880
he's good at anticipating here,
you know?

114
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,380
Yeah.
It could be interesting.

115
00:05:20,381 --> 00:05:21,214
I think man,
if nate diaz got to like a serious 

116
00:05:24,101 --> 00:05:27,070
Moitai camp and really learn how to kick
correctly,

117
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:27,933
made more distance and then through the 
occasional fucking take down attempt in 

118
00:05:31,301 --> 00:05:32,021
there.
You know,

119
00:05:32,021 --> 00:05:32,854
I think with a lot of these guys,
one of the issues is they got a great 

120
00:05:35,441 --> 00:05:37,960
formula and that formula is winning 
fights and it can,

121
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:41,770
it can carry them very far,
but is it the best strategy?

122
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,140
The best strategy is the guy you're 
fighting.

123
00:05:44,141 --> 00:05:46,510
It doesn't have any idea what the fuck 
you're about to do.

124
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:47,653
That's the George St Pierre Strategy.
George would just mix it up so well and 

125
00:05:51,131 --> 00:05:52,660
it was like one of his best assets.

126
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:56,020
You really didn't know what his attack 
was going to be with these guys.

127
00:05:56,021 --> 00:05:56,561
Like,
you know,

128
00:05:56,561 --> 00:05:59,150
what their tax can it be with nate and 
notice attack's going to be.

129
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:02,090
But it's a fucking good attack.
It's a good attack.

130
00:06:02,091 --> 00:06:04,240
But I think we're seeing the changing of
the guard.

131
00:06:04,241 --> 00:06:05,074
You're,
you're seeing these athletes like luke 

132
00:06:05,871 --> 00:06:08,390
rockhold is just a freak.
Conor mcgregor,

133
00:06:08,391 --> 00:06:11,060
these guys who can do it all.
So you have the old guard with,

134
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,890
you know,
I'm not,

135
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,650
I'm not hating on these guys,
but I was one of the old guards.

136
00:06:15,651 --> 00:06:16,990
I like to,
uh,

137
00:06:16,991 --> 00:06:18,380
you know,
wrestle box,

138
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,300
didn't do a lot of kickboxing,
knew a lot of kicks.

139
00:06:20,301 --> 00:06:23,270
You look at Rashad Evans,
really not kickboxer good at wrestling,

140
00:06:23,271 --> 00:06:24,104
good at box,
and we know who's gonna bring to the 

141
00:06:24,621 --> 00:06:26,840
table.
He's got a big head kick knock out.

142
00:06:26,841 --> 00:06:27,674
And Sean Salmon,
that's like one of his true biggest 

143
00:06:29,391 --> 00:06:30,770
highlight reel for sure.

144
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:31,900
But,
but how long ago was that?

145
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:32,893
Long time ago.
You would've thought that that would 

146
00:06:33,731 --> 00:06:36,680
have been a bigger part of his arsenal.
He can do.

147
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:37,723
He's athletic enough.
You Ain't get a guy like Ryan Bader 

148
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:41,510
wrestler box,
so you have this old guard.

149
00:06:41,511 --> 00:06:42,770
The new guys coming up,
man,

150
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,050
if you don't have it all good luck and 
they're.

151
00:06:45,051 --> 00:06:48,140
And they're tossing these guys up who 
are phenomenal fighters.

152
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:48,974
They have these huge,
a fan base and stuff like that and 

153
00:06:51,621 --> 00:06:52,454
they're,
they're giving it to these young 

154
00:06:53,451 --> 00:06:56,930
athletic guys and good luck with that.
Would that would that skillset,

155
00:06:56,931 --> 00:06:57,441
man?
It's.

156
00:06:57,441 --> 00:06:58,274
I think it's,
this sport is just still evolving and 

157
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,690
we're in the middle of it and we're 
watching it happen,

158
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,553
but it's still all over the place.
It's still like your weight class is a 

159
00:07:06,651 --> 00:07:08,330
perfect example.
Your weight class,

160
00:07:08,331 --> 00:07:10,490
you cannot be one dimensional.

161
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:13,220
You can close.
There's no one you can't do it.

162
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,960
It's not.
It's not an option.

163
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:18,320
There's no one who one dimensional.
Who's anywhere near the top 10 where you

164
00:07:18,321 --> 00:07:23,180
have maybe out of the top five say for 
me the most one dimensional or pseudo.

165
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:24,470
Yeah.
But are they really,

166
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,570
you know,
for me it gives us amazing ground guy,

167
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:29,450
but he tries to kick box everybody's so 
who knows the wrestler,

168
00:07:29,451 --> 00:07:30,970
but he's trying to punch a hole in your 
head.

169
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:31,813
So fucking striking is not bad.
So who does try our very sharp slow for 

170
00:07:36,561 --> 00:07:37,394
the weight class,
but he's so strong and he does negate 

171
00:07:40,071 --> 00:07:40,904
the gap very well.
So I think that he takes care of his 

172
00:07:45,441 --> 00:07:46,274
lack of speed,
but then you fight someone like 

173
00:07:47,871 --> 00:07:50,030
Demetrius where everything is about 
speed.

174
00:07:50,031 --> 00:07:52,940
So that's where I think he's still too 
slow to beat demetrious.

175
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,560
It's going to be an interesting fight.

176
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,250
It's going to be a real interesting 
fight.

177
00:07:56,251 --> 00:07:57,800
I mean,
you're talking about a guy was a Olympic

178
00:07:57,801 --> 00:08:02,150
gold medalist and wrestling and he's a 
motherfucker with his mindset,

179
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:03,980
his mind.
He mean he is a winter,

180
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:06,590
so who was just a straight up wait up 
winter.

181
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,630
All those Olympic athletes that come 
into the UFC,

182
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:10,480
they were all pretty successful.
Man.

183
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:14,070
They think about them.
You Got Dan Henderson a DC,

184
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:18,920
so huda off obviously Ronda Rousey.
You've got all that Olympic mindset,

185
00:08:18,921 --> 00:08:19,754
man.
The.

186
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,630
It's priceless.
Do you remember?

187
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,350
Yes.
It was like,

188
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,420
hello everybody.
If they're lucky,

189
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,313
wake the whole division.
So lucky that he had a good wrestling 

190
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,513
wrestling,
a teaching Gig coaching and they got a 

191
00:08:33,321 --> 00:08:34,700
good offer.
If people.

192
00:08:34,701 --> 00:08:37,550
He didn't want him to,
they wouldn't let him fight in the UFC.

193
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:40,750
Was the Brigham Young.
I think that's what he was with and they

194
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:42,140
were like,
you can't fight in the UFC.

195
00:08:42,141 --> 00:08:44,150
He can't fight cage fighting while 
you're teaching wrestling,

196
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,013
not byu son.
They're so lucky because of that 

197
00:08:47,991 --> 00:08:48,824
motherfucker got in there.
He looked at every single thing about 

198
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:57,060
somebody like Yoel Romero said,
you've seen him get taken down.

199
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:00,600
Yeah,
you can take a stand up.

200
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:01,653
Stand up holding me down with Jesus on 
my side and change the way you hold him 

201
00:09:08,611 --> 00:09:09,790
down.
It's drug test.

202
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,070
So screwed.
Oh,

203
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:20,430
I don't want.
I don't mean this flip scripts there,

204
00:09:20,431 --> 00:09:21,264
but how about bisbing Anderson Silva?
I was blowing your phone up during that 

205
00:09:24,401 --> 00:09:27,180
man.
That was first of all.

206
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:30,870
Biz being is one of the toughest man on 
the planet.

207
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:33,420
That dude has one eyeball.
Okay.

208
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,960
One knocked out bed.
The end of the third round came back,

209
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:41,300
won the fourth document.
The guy's blind in one eye.

210
00:09:41,301 --> 00:09:43,920
I don't know that they don't bring 
people to see something.

211
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,660
Say something,
but it's.

212
00:09:45,661 --> 00:09:47,880
It's a.
because we were reading the teleprompter

213
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,890
and he's.
It's difficult.

214
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,930
It's like that.
I is,

215
00:09:51,931 --> 00:09:54,010
I guess at certain angles he's got a 
hold of.

216
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,500
I certainly because it's kind of tunnel 
vision.

217
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:58,350
Oil in it.
Oil In the other.

218
00:09:58,351 --> 00:09:59,700
I have a Zap.
Yeah,

219
00:09:59,701 --> 00:10:03,120
and that's to protect the retina and 
keep it in place is that they can attach

220
00:10:03,121 --> 00:10:05,630
it yet because if they attach it,
it was a rip off again.

221
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:06,930
Yeah.
They attach it again.

222
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:09,000
It'll be more damaging,
so he has to wait until he's.

223
00:10:09,001 --> 00:10:10,520
After he's done fighting,
they can read it.

224
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:11,363
So thinking about this,
he'd be interested in Silva with one I 

225
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,840
Nelson's a south pole.
You fucked.

226
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,070
How crazy.
That is.

227
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,270
Crazy.
It's nuts man.

228
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:20,160
That flying to meet him.
Hi.

229
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:21,283
Yeah,
right.

230
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:24,510
But need that Anderson landed was 
goddamn glorious.

231
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:26,563
Wouldn't he didn't kick.
He jumps up with the front leg or with 

232
00:10:29,401 --> 00:10:30,234
the right leg and then like there's all,
just like a pause in the air and then 

233
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:37,860
back lizard.
He still had that ability to move,

234
00:10:37,861 --> 00:10:39,900
like just kind of stare at you right 
against the cage.

235
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:42,360
But then it was weird when he was in the
middle of the cage,

236
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,313
he didn't seem to want to throw.
It was so weird that you felt like he 

237
00:10:45,781 --> 00:10:49,740
had bisbing like especially the 
beginning of the fourth round,

238
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:51,900
he could've capitalized and he was 
hesitant.

239
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,310
He's 40.
Is that what it is?

240
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,530
He's 40,
40 year old man.

241
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:59,130
Can't just chalk that up like he's just 
an older fighter man.

242
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,910
Phenomenal fighting natural.
Yeah.

243
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,033
And you know,
I mean bisbing was given them a ton of 

244
00:11:03,481 --> 00:11:05,910
shit saying you've been on steroids your
whole career.

245
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,433
Fair assumption.
We don't know if that's true or not 

246
00:11:09,361 --> 00:11:11,460
true.
We just know the one time he was tested,

247
00:11:11,461 --> 00:11:12,310
he got caught.
Yeah.

248
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,231
That's.
So.

249
00:11:13,231 --> 00:11:15,750
It's not like outlandish for Yasmin to 
say that.

250
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:18,420
The one time out of competition testing 
he got caught.

251
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:19,403
He knew who the fuck knows man.
It's hilarious when you look at his 

252
00:11:21,871 --> 00:11:26,710
trainer and he go,
purple man guys.

253
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,630
I mean he's,
I think he's in his sixties and I'm not.

254
00:11:30,631 --> 00:11:34,310
I think he might be like 65,
66 years old or something like that.

255
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:37,640
Dick Veins have got more muscle than all
of us together.

256
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,890
We packed all my muscle together easily.
He looks like a cluster.

257
00:11:40,891 --> 00:11:42,960
Of course.
Cox with fees so big.

258
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:46,350
He's so big.
So he's not natural.

259
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:47,303
Okay.
So if he's not natural than Anderson 

260
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,010
knows about steroids,
he's heard of them.

261
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,253
He's the guy who was teaching him how to
lift weights and running them through 

262
00:11:53,771 --> 00:11:54,190
his strength

263
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:57,700
and conditioning program is 10 years 
later.

264
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,590
Yeah.
Oh,

265
00:11:59,591 --> 00:12:01,120
you know,
all these years you've been fighting.

266
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:01,954
This is stuff that I do.
It's probably not interesting for 

267
00:12:04,931 --> 00:12:07,270
recovery.
Super Person.

268
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:12,330
Super to super prison.
A sport that's like if you,

269
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,410
you know,
if you have your body moves better,

270
00:12:14,411 --> 00:12:15,244
you don't get brain damage,
but that's not important that the 

271
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,880
testing is super effective,
isn't it?

272
00:12:18,881 --> 00:12:19,714
They're doing these guys.
Jeff Gate is a mother fucker and he's 

273
00:12:23,531 --> 00:12:26,080
not playing games.
He's trying to catch dudes.

274
00:12:26,081 --> 00:12:26,914
He's showing up at your house at 6:00
in the morning and he's taking the piss 

275
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,343
goal blood.
They got me the other day before I came 

276
00:12:32,201 --> 00:12:33,034
up here or know when I'm going to do a 
podcast and they called me as I'm 10 

277
00:12:38,021 --> 00:12:39,130
minutes away,
five minutes away.

278
00:12:39,131 --> 00:12:41,350
Where are you?
I'm in La.

279
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,281
I was like,
well,

280
00:12:42,281 --> 00:12:44,140
you've got my gym.
Just wait for me.

281
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,630
I'll come back after the show.
No,

282
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:45,821
no,
no,

283
00:12:45,821 --> 00:12:46,870
we're coming to you,
bitch.

284
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:50,010
You fucking drove up to Danielle Lee's 
house.

285
00:12:50,011 --> 00:12:50,421
Yeah,
no,

286
00:12:50,421 --> 00:12:55,421
to the way he does his podcast.
They watched me do the podcast after.

287
00:12:55,811 --> 00:12:58,330
Tested me.
Super Nice people.

288
00:12:58,331 --> 00:13:00,920
Very professional,
but they.

289
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:01,853
They're not fucking paying for 
everything they touched for weed and 

290
00:13:05,501 --> 00:13:06,370
everything.
Everything.

291
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,750
Yeah,
but we doesn't matter.

292
00:13:07,751 --> 00:13:09,750
Out of competition,
competition.

293
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:10,210
That doesn't.
Okay,

294
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:11,043
so let me ask you this.
Nor has coped by the way that was the 

295
00:13:12,431 --> 00:13:15,190
John Johnson voice.
So let me ask you this.

296
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,870
If,
if Nate Diaz,

297
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:18,990
Nate Diaz,
short notice fight.

298
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:22,840
Let's take the word out.
So let's say what you're going to say.

299
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,010
Let's say smoking weed.
He beats conor.

300
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,133
Yeah,
I,

301
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,190
I'm,
I'm sure.

302
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,930
Then you get flags.
It's a,

303
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:29,830
it's a Dq,
right?

304
00:13:29,831 --> 00:13:32,660
It'd be a little contest if I smoked 
weed to fight.

305
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,360
If I smoked weed today.

306
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:37,480
The fight is in two days or three days,
right?

307
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,210
If I smoked weed today and the day of 
the fight,

308
00:13:40,211 --> 00:13:41,530
I asked him,
would you test me?

309
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,140
I want to find out like what,
what the levels are.

310
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,213
I think I'd be okay.
I think you literally have to get high 

311
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:52,900
the day before or the day of,
with the new parameters.

312
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:53,763
Oh really?
Yeah.

313
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:55,150
Well that's good then.
Yeah,

314
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:57,610
it's way different.
It's way different.

315
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,100
It's way different than it used to be.
So you have to.

316
00:14:00,101 --> 00:14:03,460
It's not like trace,
they used to have trace amounts of thc,

317
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,533
but if I really believe that if I smoke 
weed today and I ask them to test me on 

318
00:14:06,911 --> 00:14:07,870
Saturday,
I'd be okay.

319
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:10,090
The day of the fight though,
Huh?

320
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:15,150
Well Nick Diaz,
apparently Tomi was so tested,

321
00:14:15,341 --> 00:14:16,174
so high that like this motherfucker had 
to be high as fuck when he fought going 

322
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:22,090
just saying just went out there.

323
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:26,260
Who pulls off a Gogo fucking Plata and 
mma to Glorious and beautiful.

324
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,840
And after we got his cheek broken.
Yeah,

325
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,970
that's true.
You get hit with a bomb by going.

326
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:31,923
When can nate?
I'm can nick fight again in about nine 

327
00:14:33,551 --> 00:14:36,780
months.
I want to sit around.

328
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:40,000
They changed it around and was supposed 
to be five years and they made it like a

329
00:14:40,001 --> 00:14:41,680
year and a half I think is.
Oh,

330
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:43,960
they made it.
I think they made it 16 weeks shorter.

331
00:14:43,961 --> 00:14:46,150
Yeah.
So it'd be an interesting fight.

332
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,400
Only because they fought before.
And Nick,

333
00:14:48,401 --> 00:14:51,440
one surprise nick isn't calling Robbie 
lawler out.

334
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,813
Well,
I don't think nick's callnote anybody 

335
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,850
next just chilling out and waiting for 
all this bullshit to settle.

336
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:58,670
He got fucking railroaded,
man,

337
00:14:58,671 --> 00:14:59,504
because nick passed to Wida tests,
the really deep comprehensive blood 

338
00:15:05,301 --> 00:15:08,540
screens that they use for the Olympics.
He passed those with flying colors.

339
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,673
What?
He didn't pass it some bullshit ass 

340
00:15:11,001 --> 00:15:11,834
quest diagnostics lab test that the 
fucking Nevada state athletic 

341
00:15:15,321 --> 00:15:16,340
commission,
Super,

342
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:17,483
Super Shady,
and these assholes wouldn't even pay 

343
00:15:19,971 --> 00:15:24,020
attention to the other two tests and 
they tried to ban them for five years.

344
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,020
That's insane.
Assholes,

345
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:27,770
man.
That bat vandelay Silva things.

346
00:15:27,771 --> 00:15:29,360
Another example,
assholes.

347
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:30,373
Assholes.
Where they did the vandelay banned him 

348
00:15:31,521 --> 00:15:32,420
for life.
That's booked.

349
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,980
Ventilator signed with bell door.
Yep.

350
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:37,790
But so abilities he did see today,
is it breaking news and Shit.

351
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,080
Damn,
I didn't know that,

352
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,273
but here's the deal.
We talked on the last podcast and Bill 

353
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,990
Wanderlei Silva eventually has to fight 
fader or first he's gonna fight fader or

354
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,980
first that's the big fight in Japan or 
Japan,

355
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:53,810
but the having that fight in Japan could
throw his whole beltour deal in jeopardy

356
00:15:53,811 --> 00:15:57,380
because he's going to have to find on 
Indian casinos once he fights,

357
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,273
which at vandelays age is probably not 
the worst thing in the world anyway 

358
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:03,050
because it's good and juicy.

359
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:05,780
There's certain guys probably will 
actually.

360
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:08,143
There's certain guys that only fight in 
certain places and they look 

361
00:16:11,211 --> 00:16:13,550
ridiculously muscular.
Now.

362
00:16:13,551 --> 00:16:16,490
I don't know exactly how everything 
works,

363
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:19,520
but I know for Brazil,
but I know that.

364
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:21,050
Well that's,
that's even more shit.

365
00:16:21,051 --> 00:16:24,320
That's even Australia only please.
The,

366
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:25,203
um,
the thing is they don't have a Jeff 

367
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,340
Levitsky at Bella tour.
They don't have a fucking a hawk.

368
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,690
Nor do they want one.
No,

369
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:37,230
they don't want one.
You don't want the UFC.

370
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,710
Like what am I trying to do?
What are you trying to do here?

371
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:40,563
You fucking move on with our alumni,
but you're dealing with the commission 

372
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:46,730
to missions easy.
Oh,

373
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:49,060
enforced this.
Not the commissioner.

374
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:51,020
This is the UFC is I did like the 
commission.

375
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:54,290
Look,
it's a famous line that someone made up.

376
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:55,124
I don't know who it was,
but they said that passing one of those 

377
00:16:56,721 --> 00:16:58,520
urine test is an intelligence test.

378
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,750
It's not a drug test.
Correct.

379
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,690
It might've been a Victor Conte might've
been victor contact,

380
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,180
but he,
you know,

381
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,680
who's the bulk Ho guy who if anybody 
fucking knows,

382
00:17:06,681 --> 00:17:08,780
he knows.
So I think,

383
00:17:08,781 --> 00:17:09,530
uh,
I,

384
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:11,030
I think vandelay well,
first of all,

385
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:11,864
I think they should fucking vandelays 
suspension should be exactly as long as 

386
00:17:14,721 --> 00:17:15,554
it would have been if he got popped,
which I think is nine months at the 

387
00:17:17,781 --> 00:17:19,010
time.
Was it,

388
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,330
was it back then when he got caught?
Was it nine months?

389
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:22,580
Back then?
It was nine months.

390
00:17:22,581 --> 00:17:24,230
Yeah.
If you test positive nine months,

391
00:17:24,231 --> 00:17:25,580
so he's good.
He should be done.

392
00:17:25,581 --> 00:17:26,414
This suspension should be over,
find them a little bit and let's move 

393
00:17:28,701 --> 00:17:29,180
on.
Man.

394
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:33,690
The guy never tested positive once.
Manderlay positive ones,

395
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:34,543
Napa,
her vandelay probably definitely did 

396
00:17:37,281 --> 00:17:38,031
something.
I mean,

397
00:17:38,031 --> 00:17:39,710
you look at when he was fighting in 
Japan,

398
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:42,500
but Japan didn't have tests or if they 
did have tests,

399
00:17:42,501 --> 00:17:44,060
they didn't care.
You know,

400
00:17:44,061 --> 00:17:45,470
they,
they look mean incident.

401
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:47,030
This is coming straight from ensign.
Anyway.

402
00:17:47,031 --> 00:17:50,250
Who said it was on his contract that we 
will

403
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:55,200
not test you for steroids?
Ensign is incapable of lying.

404
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:58,440
He does not lie.
Chocolate l talked about it.

405
00:17:58,441 --> 00:17:59,274
He said he took a piss test.
I was like walking around and just put 

406
00:18:02,351 --> 00:18:04,070
it on the back.
Just throw up and toilet.

407
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:06,150
He was like,
I'm not going to set it on the table.

408
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:07,560
There's no one around like just 
wherever.

409
00:18:07,561 --> 00:18:10,600
Then they just want to check.
Check it out.

410
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,360
Here's a sharpie.
Draw your name on it.

411
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:16,690
Please just write negative on it now.
Whatever you want,

412
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:18,390
whenever you want.
Right?

413
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:21,480
Healthy.
Either way,

414
00:18:21,481 --> 00:18:26,160
awesome to not drink.
That's how you came back.

415
00:18:26,161 --> 00:18:27,590
Do not drink,
but you know,

416
00:18:27,591 --> 00:18:28,560
man,
it was,

417
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,820
it was.
Everybody knew.

418
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:30,743
You know,
if you have a league where everybody 

419
00:18:31,471 --> 00:18:34,320
knows that everybody else is doing 
whatever the fuck they want,

420
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:35,303
that's a different thing.
It's not really cheating because it's 

421
00:18:37,561 --> 00:18:38,640
not illegal over there.

422
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:39,503
It's not the same thing as over here.
You just can't do that and be a legit 

423
00:18:43,681 --> 00:18:44,760
sport.
You know?

424
00:18:44,761 --> 00:18:47,680
You just can't.
Baseball powerlifting,

425
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,510
excuse me,
power lifting.

426
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:55,790
I'm going to get so much hate for this.
I'm talking about a mainstream sport,

427
00:18:56,281 --> 00:18:57,900
bro.
Don't ever,

428
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,880
ever,
ever.

429
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:03,240
Could you look at MBA,
strict drug testing,

430
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:06,390
NFL,
mlb not super strict.

431
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,433
There's fucking no home runs anymore.
People look like if bodybuilding and 

432
00:19:11,641 --> 00:19:16,140
power lifting if 100 percent,
it was legit across the board.

433
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:17,243
No steroids whatsoever.
Knocking on your door every morning at 

434
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:20,790
4:00
AM,

435
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:21,623
they would all look like they look like 
in Speedo with no one would look at the 

436
00:19:27,451 --> 00:19:30,270
sixties.
60 bodybuilders and power lifters,

437
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:31,920
legs.
Especially the bodybuilders.

438
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,200
Their legs are actually kind of small.
No.

439
00:19:34,201 --> 00:19:35,034
They look good like they look like no,
they look how they just all do this and 

440
00:19:39,031 --> 00:19:41,440
they're in their high waisted tights and
they just hired.

441
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:45,450
There's certain guys from the 
bodybuilding era of like Schwartzenegger

442
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:50,220
that to this day they look small but 
yoked to sock like Frank Zane,

443
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:51,483
like Frank Zane.
He's never looked like Lee Haney or any 

444
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:57,630
Dorian Yates or woman was three.
What?

445
00:19:57,631 --> 00:20:00,480
Three whole muscle.
There was a guy like five,

446
00:20:00,481 --> 00:20:01,920
nine.
That's insane.

447
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,160
Isn't running short.
Running coma.

448
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:09,000
It was like six something.
Six to which one is really short.

449
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:11,420
Dorian Yates.
I thought this Dorian pretty good.

450
00:20:11,421 --> 00:20:12,254
Back in the day,
like before they started doing a lot of 

451
00:20:14,071 --> 00:20:15,100
steroids.
Like what?

452
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,760
Well,
who did pumping iron gains?

453
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,490
The guy's last name is Kenton.
I knew him and I spoke to him.

454
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:20,483
He said that was.
There was a black guy and featured and 

455
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,380
pumping are,
and I can't remember his name,

456
00:20:25,381 --> 00:20:29,490
but Albert Bekos a really muscular guy.
Yeah.

457
00:20:29,491 --> 00:20:34,491
He was eating 20 pounds of red meat a 
day and that's how he was getting.

458
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,000
He was like,
lions eat a lot of meat.

459
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:39,430
Second Dave is eating bro.
Science.

460
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:43,450
God Damn.
It literally me that a body.

461
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,420
But he was shredded though.
He was shy,

462
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,460
but you're not lying,
Huh?

463
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:51,550
Like what?
He would eat rice,

464
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:53,423
a large colonies.
Rice and 20 pounds of red meat to tell 

465
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,390
them that gorillas only broccoli.
Yeah.

466
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,140
Right,
right.

467
00:20:59,140 --> 00:20:59,973
All they eat is fucking go to the zoo.
They're eating stalks of broccoli and 

468
00:21:01,991 --> 00:21:04,480
bamboo,
but their dicks are this big.

469
00:21:04,481 --> 00:21:06,220
So it's true.
That's true.

470
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:07,720
He was shredded in the,
in the,

471
00:21:07,721 --> 00:21:08,170
um,
he's.

472
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:11,530
Did you see his dick because it was it a
big,

473
00:21:11,531 --> 00:21:12,364
but it was tasty,
tasty fruit and those were the days 

474
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:21,600
because it was arnold in Venice Beach,
Gold's gym collages everywhere.

475
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:26,110
Dick Frank Columbo was.
He was in class.

476
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,210
Franco Columbo.
Super Short.

477
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,073
Yeah.
That Franco Columbia used to be able to 

478
00:21:30,431 --> 00:21:34,090
take one of those hot water bottles and 
his lungs were so strongly would make it

479
00:21:34,091 --> 00:21:36,940
explode.
He would blow into it until it blew up.

480
00:21:36,941 --> 00:21:37,774
I fucking hot water bottle.
One of those rubber things that nobody 

481
00:21:47,891 --> 00:21:49,840
else could do it,
but very few people could do it.

482
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:52,030
What in the fuck?
He do dips.

483
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,093
He would do dips with M,
two dudes hanging off his waist and he 

484
00:21:57,731 --> 00:22:00,720
would do dips.
And how about let's grab some weights,

485
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:05,530
know what he looks like today.
Remember plats member as well as you can

486
00:22:05,531 --> 00:22:06,520
see it on youtube.
He's,

487
00:22:06,521 --> 00:22:11,470
he's squat deep squat 500 pounds.
I think it was 25 times.

488
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:14,170
Those guys were doing it back then 
though.

489
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,180
Oh yeah.
Lifting weights,

490
00:22:16,181 --> 00:22:19,030
hanging everything on the beach time,
smoking weed,

491
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:19,983
banging chicks.
Tons of chicks letting guys below them 

492
00:22:22,031 --> 00:22:23,840
so they have money for steroids.
Good chance.

493
00:22:23,841 --> 00:22:24,674
A good chance was going on.
That was a big thing with those 

494
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,270
bodybuilder.
Yeah.

495
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,560
The big thing there.
The original sugar babies.

496
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,650
I'm dead serious,
man.

497
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,570
He's such a great word.

498
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:42,070
Bodybuilders with original sugar,
baby.

499
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,380
Well,
you got to do what you gotta do.

500
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:48,040
Lift and pay the bill or suck a dick.
You got two options.

501
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:49,350
You want muscles,
son?

502
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,050
Come here.
Come on.

503
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:51,670
You want to hang out with your boys on 
the beach,

504
00:22:51,671 --> 00:22:54,340
but I like this Dick.
Imagine steroids didn't work,

505
00:22:54,341 --> 00:22:59,050
but sucking Dick did be the only way to 
get swoll yet a suck a dick.

506
00:22:59,051 --> 00:23:00,760
Calvin would be the biggest motherfucker
in the room.

507
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:01,310
Tam,
right?

508
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:04,810
I wouldn't change what gay.
They would change it.

509
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:07,050
Oh,
I'm not gay because I like Dick's.

510
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:09,700
I'm just trying to get big.
Get big.

511
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:13,960
Get big guys would take brewer's yeast 
back in the day.

512
00:23:13,961 --> 00:23:15,640
Do you remember that?
Oh Dude,

513
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,350
I knew guys who were just always 
lifting.

514
00:23:17,351 --> 00:23:19,030
They'd go check this out.
I'd be like,

515
00:23:19,031 --> 00:23:20,580
why?
Why would it take now?

516
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:21,483
Apparently brewer's yeast makes you 
bigger school that's super and sell it 

517
00:23:25,241 --> 00:23:25,990
in pill form.

518
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:27,260
You don't remember that?
No.

519
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,870
Just because didn't stick because you 
guys are older.

520
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:30,733
When steroids hit,
they didn't think it was as bad as it 

521
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:33,550
was.
Right.

522
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:36,610
Like a WHO's at Laila as NATO was kind 
of the first one who's like,

523
00:23:36,611 --> 00:23:37,444
oh,
I'm going to die because I use steroids 

524
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,570
before it wasn't a big deal.
It's kind of like cigarettes,

525
00:23:40,571 --> 00:23:41,520
right?
See Blind.

526
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:42,383
Well,
Zeto I don't think it was because of 

527
00:23:43,751 --> 00:23:46,130
that.
I think would lozito was doing.

528
00:23:46,131 --> 00:23:49,130
He was doing an early form of human 
growth hormone.

529
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,930
I might be off base here.
Jamie.

530
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,793
Jamie wanted to say though,
but the early form of human growth 

531
00:23:55,911 --> 00:23:59,160
hormone was taken from cadavers.
It wasn't taken.

532
00:23:59,161 --> 00:23:59,994
It wasn't made in a lab with bacteria.
The way they make growth hormone today 

533
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,720
in the early form of human growth 
hormone,

534
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:06,883
you would take it and there was like 
crazy adverse side effects like people 

535
00:24:10,881 --> 00:24:11,714
got really fucked up that you don't get 
fucking Jacob Crooks felt you can get 

536
00:24:15,261 --> 00:24:18,530
mad cow disease from him from it.

537
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:19,403
You get all kinds of data.
Was saying that he was dying because of 

538
00:24:22,041 --> 00:24:23,420
that and then scientists came out or 
like,

539
00:24:23,421 --> 00:24:25,910
no son,
I don't think he has a brain tumor.

540
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:27,110
It was,
well,

541
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:27,973
you know,
you also got to deal with the massive 

542
00:24:30,351 --> 00:24:34,210
amount of trauma.
That guy played football for hard,

543
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:37,190
hard maybe.
Who knows?

544
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:41,030
There's all sorts of bad things happen 
to your brain when you play football for

545
00:24:41,031 --> 00:24:41,960
30 years.
I mean,

546
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:44,870
especially the way he did football back 
then was different.

547
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,390
Who knows why,
kind of why he got brain,

548
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,253
but here's the thing.
Not a lot of other guys that were doing 

549
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:51,950
what he did.
God brain tumors,

550
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,990
so it could have been completely 
unrelated.

551
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,820
You just don't.
They say that human growth hormone,

552
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,820
from what I understand is so it's going 
to help grow everything.

553
00:24:58,821 --> 00:24:59,654
That's good,
but also if you have a tumor cell to 

554
00:25:00,651 --> 00:25:02,030
help grow that,
it could.

555
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:05,060
It's potentially a,
that is potentially a side effect,

556
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:06,283
you know,
that's why one of the things they say 

557
00:25:07,041 --> 00:25:09,710
that's really important than if you,
if you do do that,

558
00:25:09,711 --> 00:25:10,544
you gotta get yourself scanned and if 
you're doing it like the way those guys 

559
00:25:12,981 --> 00:25:15,230
are doing and where you're taking like 
10 units a day,

560
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,910
you know,
they've taken mass.

561
00:25:16,911 --> 00:25:18,680
That's why the bodybuilders show big and
they have those,

562
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:22,220
those power guts.
Guts.

563
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:24,650
Yeah.
Yeah man.

564
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:26,050
Yeah.
Well it,

565
00:25:26,051 --> 00:25:26,570
it,
it,

566
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:29,930
it's like these bulging muscles too.
That's the other thing,

567
00:25:29,931 --> 00:25:33,380
like if you have those gigantic like Lee
Haney,

568
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:36,320
ab muscles,
you've got to think of his whole body.

569
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:38,170
Everything's giant.
Everything's trying,

570
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:40,430
so his ab muscles are giant too.
They,

571
00:25:40,431 --> 00:25:43,720
they stick out also because there is 
Oregon,

572
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:46,760
Oregon to.
Because a greater deck apparently.

573
00:25:46,761 --> 00:25:47,594
No Sir.
If you do take massive amounts for long 

574
00:25:50,301 --> 00:25:52,790
periods of time,
it can grow your organs larger,

575
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,150
but I think what we're looking at and 
where you're looking at those guys,

576
00:25:56,151 --> 00:25:58,460
a lot of it is just massive muscle.

577
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,513
I agree.
It's the more Muslim than we've ever 

578
00:26:00,951 --> 00:26:01,784
seen because you look at even arnold 
site gets a different game and when I 

579
00:26:03,981 --> 00:26:06,290
was doing it was just basically just 
steroids.

580
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:08,240
Yeah.
And now they're doing all these designer

581
00:26:08,241 --> 00:26:10,520
drugs.
They sweat nonstop.

582
00:26:10,521 --> 00:26:12,590
I don't know if you've hung out with the
current bodybuilder.

583
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:17,570
They sweat.
Not Straight up dying.

584
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:19,240
There are always dying straight up 
dining.

585
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:23,120
Dorian and Lee Haney was very tough.
From what I understand,

586
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:26,060
it wasn't me.
Well if Lee Haney six feet tall,

587
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:30,970
looks like Dorian's someone on send main
it a glorious.

588
00:26:30,971 --> 00:26:32,960
He's an orange line.
Glorious main.

589
00:26:32,961 --> 00:26:34,280
He's an orange.
He's Donald Trump.

590
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:35,660
It looks like Donald Trump.
If Donald,

591
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:36,783
isn't it?
Isn't it weird how they turn bronze 

592
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,470
because black guys,
right?

593
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,840
They're like fucking see every muscle.
So white dudes like,

594
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:43,100
dude,
we got to get black.

595
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:46,010
The original original like chocolate 
face.

596
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:47,850
The guys that really dark.

597
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,330
Yeah,
they'll,

598
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:49,163
there'll be,
they'll have a white face and then the 

599
00:26:50,671 --> 00:26:52,230
rest of them.
So dark black,

600
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:53,383
straight,
black,

601
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:54,760
Jamaican.
Yeah.

602
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:56,310
Because they want to compete with the 
black guy.

603
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,173
Yeah.
Yeah.

604
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:00,530
Just to show contrast.
Muslim guys own bodybuilding.

605
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:02,100
Now,
do they own it now,

606
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:03,440
Phil Heath?
Five time.

607
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,370
Mr Olympia champion.
Before that,

608
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:07,830
well it was Jay Cutler,
but then you have Ronnie Coleman for all

609
00:27:07,831 --> 00:27:09,750
those years.
Dexter Jackson.

610
00:27:09,751 --> 00:27:10,584
I don't know how long you could do that 
for it to take that much steroids at 

611
00:27:13,831 --> 00:27:16,230
that high level.
How long was the most eight?

612
00:27:16,231 --> 00:27:18,630
I think eight is the most.
Six.

613
00:27:18,631 --> 00:27:21,800
I think you already do it.
How many years at Arnie?

614
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:22,803
When Arnie was.
He was doing it right and then he just 

615
00:27:25,681 --> 00:27:27,600
blew the fuck up and went full 
celebrity.

616
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:28,211
It was like,
you know what,

617
00:27:28,211 --> 00:27:30,040
I'm going to quit fucking lifting 
weights with you mean hit.

618
00:27:30,041 --> 00:27:30,930
I think go make some money.

619
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:35,490
Phil Heath wants to do.
He wants to get 10 titles and then quit.

620
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:38,430
That's like a good number.
I was like,

621
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:39,403
yeah.
The problem with those guys is what do 

622
00:27:39,901 --> 00:27:42,190
they do when it's over?
They showed um,

623
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:43,703
some of the guys from the old days that 
are still alive today and they get off 

624
00:27:47,251 --> 00:27:50,680
the sauce and their body just depressed 
kidneys are,

625
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:54,510
wouldn't they have to keep doing it to,
to fill the gap in their body.

626
00:27:54,511 --> 00:27:56,760
So gonna have to do something,
some form of testosterone,

627
00:27:56,761 --> 00:27:58,500
but the kidneys is from the weight 
cutter.

628
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:01,200
Yeah.
Unless the kidneys is not from steroids.

629
00:28:01,201 --> 00:28:03,960
The kidneys is from the massive 
dehydration.

630
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,033
When you see those guys and they're 
standing on that scale or not scale on 

631
00:28:07,771 --> 00:28:11,250
that stage and they're posing,
they're down to like three percent body,

632
00:28:11,251 --> 00:28:12,930
close to death,
close to death.

633
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,610
They'll carb,
no water,

634
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:17,160
no carbs.
Their bodies are just like,

635
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:19,343
if you try and talk to one,
well when they're getting ready for 

636
00:28:21,001 --> 00:28:21,834
that,
it's the brain barely functions because 

637
00:28:23,491 --> 00:28:24,570
they're just so depleted.

638
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,160
They know how to.
It's so dangerous,

639
00:28:26,161 --> 00:28:27,780
man.
So dangerous.

640
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,850
Well,
now they manipulate their insulin to.

641
00:28:29,851 --> 00:28:32,250
They do all kinds of stuff that's 
dangerous.

642
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,620
Pumping iron.
No generation.

643
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,220
Iron generation generation.
I.

644
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:38,910
Yeah.
Yeah.

645
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:40,770
Netflix,
I'm sure.

646
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:44,530
Yup.
With Kai Greene Guy Green car green.

647
00:28:44,531 --> 00:28:47,610
Who is a giant.
He's a giant gay.

648
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,490
He's not gay.
Whoa Bro.

649
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,080
How dare you.
Sorry.

650
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:55,680
Green is a guy.
We were talking gay for pay.

651
00:28:57,530 --> 00:29:00,330
There's videos out there of him fucking 
grapefruits for money.

652
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:01,580
Right?
But it might,

653
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,850
it might.
It might be a cantaloupe,

654
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:05,610
but he's doing some case stuff.
He's like stripping for men.

655
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,470
It's all over the Internet.
Gay Porn didn't know.

656
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,750
Hey man,
why do you say that?

657
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:12,770
Feel like he knows he did it.
Why he shouldn't.

658
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:15,000
He's awesome.
He puts on the mask,

659
00:29:15,001 --> 00:29:17,700
the mask and posts and subways.
He's second.

660
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:19,290
He comes in second to Phil Heath every 
year.

661
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:20,123
And think one of the reasons why he 
doesn't win this because he has this 

662
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:26,330
history of doing some promiscuous stuff 
with men like this.

663
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:29,750
There's a video of him stripping,
like shoves the winning.

664
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,430
Uh,
I can't compete.

665
00:29:32,431 --> 00:29:35,670
They should let them win the to never 
win when it comes in second,

666
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,530
that's really.
Look at his hair.

667
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,890
That bond in the back of his head as 
adorable.

668
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,060
Amazing.
Maybe that's the offensive part of that.

669
00:29:42,061 --> 00:29:42,894
I'm like,
is the hair,

670
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:43,811
is the,
oh,

671
00:29:43,811 --> 00:29:46,650
look at this.
What's going on there guys there?

672
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,010
And they're big rivals.
By the way,

673
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:48,970
Phil Heath.
Boy,

674
00:29:48,971 --> 00:29:50,610
they are both enormous.
You know,

675
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,660
here's the problem.
When it gets down to this,

676
00:29:52,661 --> 00:29:55,870
like these two guys,
how the fuck do you decide who wins?

677
00:29:56,110 --> 00:30:00,380
How could you even our semester,
do you tell your account?

678
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:01,121
Is it.
Well,

679
00:30:01,121 --> 00:30:03,080
you can because you're a good wine 
connoisseur.

680
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:04,870
It's like the same thing.
It's symmetry.

681
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:10,140
Do you know a great glass of wine?
The tannins and the cookie flavor A.

682
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,810
I don't get how they do it either.
It's symmetry.

683
00:30:14,811 --> 00:30:18,220
You're looking at muscle development,
but you're also looking at symmetry.

684
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:19,220
Okay,
we'll see.

685
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:21,670
But they all look like that,
but these two guys,

686
00:30:21,671 --> 00:30:24,490
they're in different stages of the pose.
Like the guy on the left,

687
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:25,343
his arms are further apart now.
No one chose that pose and the other 

688
00:30:28,901 --> 00:30:32,700
chose.
He feel he poses right,

689
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:34,870
but see how kai greene forgot about his 
legs.

690
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:35,950
Phil said,
I'm gonna.

691
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,170
Open my legs a little bit.
Look at those.

692
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:40,270
Look at the leg.
Must look at that.

693
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:43,360
That's perfect and insane.
He's perfectly proportional.

694
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:47,580
You Know Phil played basketball in 
college and it was 178 pounds pointguard

695
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:52,150
and he's got to be like 300 pounds.
Good Buddy of mine,

696
00:30:52,151 --> 00:30:53,020
man from Denver.

697
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,820
Yeah.
Going really well.

698
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:57,130
How long is he going to do this for?
He said,

699
00:30:57,131 --> 00:30:59,050
he said he wants 10 times,
this is his fifth.

700
00:30:59,051 --> 00:30:59,884
He wants 10,
so five more years in his body like 

701
00:31:02,261 --> 00:31:04,480
Jesus Christ.
[inaudible] making,

702
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:08,860
making that Cheddar though.
Is he making seven figures you.

703
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:10,510
How do they do that?
How do they make that fun?

704
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,770
Because uh,
yeah,

705
00:31:11,771 --> 00:31:13,600
so who,
who go to England,

706
00:31:13,601 --> 00:31:16,110
who do all these big uh,
programs,

707
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,620
you know,
who knows,

708
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:19,243
you know,
do all these big pro ams and get paid 

709
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:23,500
bank like over in Europe and the Middle 
East.

710
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,270
Bodybuilding huge Europe.
Yeah.

711
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:29,410
Huge way bigger than it is here.
Two hundred $50,000

712
00:31:29,411 --> 00:31:32,430
to win $400.
$200.

713
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:35,470
But then in sponsor she's making six,
seven figures.

714
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:38,620
It's interesting how much it jumped up 
for 2015.

715
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:41,840
We went from 250,
two to 75 to 400.

716
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:44,740
He's got,
he's got his own line.

717
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:46,210
He's got his own supplement line.

718
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:47,720
Doesn't think that that's pretty well,
yeah,

719
00:31:47,721 --> 00:31:49,960
I called gifted nutrition,
but I don't think it's.

720
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:52,040
I don't think that he's not making his 
money off,

721
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:52,883
that he's making money doing these tours
and go like he gets on with Olympia and 

722
00:31:55,151 --> 00:31:57,110
literally two days later he's flying to 
the Middle East,

723
00:31:57,111 --> 00:31:59,990
said he's coming in England.
He said he's gone 300 days a year.

724
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,570
Yeah,
nuts.

725
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:02,643
Well,
seminars are a big wave for a lot of 

726
00:32:03,611 --> 00:32:05,530
athletes to make money,
including MMA guys.

727
00:32:05,531 --> 00:32:06,364
A lot of guys make a lot of their money.
A lot of Jujitsu guys make a lot of 

728
00:32:08,441 --> 00:32:09,274
their money.
Especially.

729
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,370
Yeah.
Especially as huge and Jujitsu is one of

730
00:32:12,371 --> 00:32:14,470
the few seminars where you could really 
get something out of it.

731
00:32:14,471 --> 00:32:15,131
I agree.
You know,

732
00:32:15,131 --> 00:32:19,150
if you go to see a Moitai seminar,
you might learn a little bit.

733
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:20,453
I mean you could,
but a lot of people know a lot about 

734
00:32:22,001 --> 00:32:22,470
more time.

735
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:25,150
More ties is like repetition,
knowledge,

736
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:25,984
sparring,
great coaching over long periods of 

737
00:32:27,431 --> 00:32:28,990
time.
But Jujitsu,

738
00:32:28,991 --> 00:32:29,824
a guy could show you one technique and 
you could tap different sex or 

739
00:32:32,831 --> 00:32:33,491
something.
Yeah.

740
00:32:33,491 --> 00:32:36,790
It's pretty eyeopening thing like,
Woo.

741
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:41,150
I was watching your boys sideboard role.
He was doing some drills the other day.

742
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:43,030
God Damn,
that guy flows.

743
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:44,390
Ooh,
freak man.

744
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:48,170
He was doing this,
this role from,

745
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:51,770
from controlling on top side control to 
the truck,

746
00:32:51,771 --> 00:32:53,280
to the back to,
you know,

747
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,910
taking like a collar choke from behind.
Crazy.

748
00:32:55,911 --> 00:32:57,020
How moves.
Oh my God.

749
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,730
If he's doing that,
he's invitation.

750
00:32:58,731 --> 00:33:00,680
Is that right?
I think he's doing super fun.

751
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,590
Hope he is.
I hope he is.

752
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,010
I'm pretty sure he's doing a superfight 
well.

753
00:33:07,011 --> 00:33:10,670
That whole Eddie Bravo invitation and 
when they're going to do the open weight

754
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,180
like anybody can compete the absolute.
That's going to be amazing.

755
00:33:14,181 --> 00:33:14,990
It's gonna be nuts.

756
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:16,060
Oh my God.
I know on.

757
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,370
It's doing one of one 65 and under at 
Don.

758
00:33:19,371 --> 00:33:20,970
At Academy in Austin.
March.

759
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:21,823
Yeah,
March 24th and I are doing the play by 

760
00:33:24,321 --> 00:33:26,660
play for that.
Are you really with a Jujitsu Guy?

761
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:28,360
Yeah,
I was going to say hopefully because I'm

762
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:30,900
going to probably do the Jujitsu play,
but for sure who you guys.

763
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:35,010
I'm going to have some travel.
Someone who's running the thing on it.

764
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:35,863
Got Them.
Do you know who the judges would play 

765
00:33:38,031 --> 00:33:38,691
but I don't.
I,

766
00:33:38,691 --> 00:33:43,691
I asked him todd white lives in on it.
Maybe it'd be him to be fun though.

767
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:45,530
Fuck yeah,
yeah.

768
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:47,900
Jujitsu tournament to the future.
I really think so.

769
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:49,690
And I think one of these platform.
Yeah,

770
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:52,460
I think one of the cool things about it 
too is that,

771
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,960
you know,
definitely get injured,

772
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:57,140
definitely get broken bones and stuff,
but you're not,

773
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:59,840
you couldn't compete it and not worried 
about head trauma,

774
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:00,953
you know,
so I think a lot of people that are 

775
00:34:02,061 --> 00:34:05,570
interested in martial arts are 
gravitating towards that because they're

776
00:34:05,571 --> 00:34:06,980
realizing now like,
hey,

777
00:34:06,981 --> 00:34:09,050
like a,
this is probably,

778
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:12,320
there's not a lot of options if you want
to learn how to fight,

779
00:34:12,321 --> 00:34:13,910
where you're not going to get your brain
rattled.

780
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:15,103
There's so many.
There's such a debate now like in 

781
00:34:16,491 --> 00:34:17,324
Europe,
especially about kids playing rugby and 

782
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:22,700
any kind of girl.
You're up in America.

783
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:25,730
I mean it's a very real thing where 
doctors and academics are going.

784
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:28,520
Hold on.
Like I know it's a great sport,

785
00:34:28,521 --> 00:34:29,354
but you are talking about,
you are talking about head trauma to 

786
00:34:31,941 --> 00:34:33,680
your 14 year old.
That's a fact.

787
00:34:33,681 --> 00:34:35,900
Whether what that's gonna do to him 
later down the line,

788
00:34:35,901 --> 00:34:39,230
we don't know America is,
chances are you'll probably be fine when

789
00:34:39,231 --> 00:34:40,064
you're talking about someone who's so 
young that they don't really understand 

790
00:34:43,311 --> 00:34:45,050
the repercussions of their current 
actions.

791
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:48,140
And if you're doing something at 14 that
might affect you when you're 44,

792
00:34:48,141 --> 00:34:50,030
that's kind of crazy,
you know?

793
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:51,920
Yeah.
But then yet again,

794
00:34:51,921 --> 00:34:54,830
this is a lot of people that play 
football and they're fine at 44.

795
00:34:54,831 --> 00:34:57,350
So you know,
a lot of people play for four years.

796
00:34:57,810 --> 00:34:59,450
I don't know about all that.
I don't know about that.

797
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:01,790
Most of those guys are fucked up.
They're just fucked up.

798
00:35:01,791 --> 00:35:05,060
But not if you played in high school.
We played in high school due to a lot of

799
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:06,840
people that they've tested that are high
school,

800
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,330
cte,
cte.

801
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,580
A lot of them are finding more and more 
sure.

802
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:11,823
And I'm sure it causes damage,
but what I'm saying is that it's not as 

803
00:35:14,271 --> 00:35:18,050
though I don't think the epidemic of 
people that play football.

804
00:35:18,051 --> 00:35:18,950
Like if you said,
well,

805
00:35:18,951 --> 00:35:21,260
most people would played football even 
in high school,

806
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,750
you know,
have brain damage.

807
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,730
I bet they do.
Compared to people who didn't.

808
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:26,930
Yeah,
not only that.

809
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:27,823
Here's the thing.
There's things like you can be high 

810
00:35:29,271 --> 00:35:30,104
functioning,
but you can also have like real impulse 

811
00:35:32,031 --> 00:35:35,810
problems and a lot of those real impulse
problems are created by head trauma,

812
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:36,610
depression.

813
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:39,270
Here's a question.
Will lash out anger issues.

814
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:40,783
A matter of fact,
one of the things that Oj Simpson's 

815
00:35:41,911 --> 00:35:42,744
doctor said that if they were doing that
same trial today when he was tried for 

816
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:48,490
murder,
they would probably bring up.

817
00:35:48,491 --> 00:35:49,260
See,
see?

818
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,760
Yeah.
But here's the question.

819
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:53,310
When you know,
if you're going to ban and it's just,

820
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,233
it's out there,
but if you're going to band combat 

821
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,990
sports for kids,
well you know,

822
00:35:57,991 --> 00:35:58,824
you wonder like what?
You get a lot of benefit from sports 

823
00:36:01,291 --> 00:36:02,850
that are rough as well in a way you 
know,

824
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:04,123
in how it builds character or it's just 
a sport you might be built for and 

825
00:36:07,201 --> 00:36:08,930
you're really good at it.
So if you're,

826
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:13,860
if you're built like a Samoan and maybe 
soccer isn't going to be as good for you

827
00:36:13,861 --> 00:36:14,694
as football.
So in a way you've got to be careful 

828
00:36:15,991 --> 00:36:16,810
with this stuff.

829
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:18,990
You need some of this stuff.
Well,

830
00:36:18,991 --> 00:36:20,700
it's definitely good to toughen people 
up.

831
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:21,970
It's definitely.
I mean there's no,

832
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,833
no better avenue to teach people 
discipline and how to be tough than 

833
00:36:28,171 --> 00:36:30,550
combat sports.
I think combat sports is,

834
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:31,503
you know,
it's the one thing where you have to 

835
00:36:32,671 --> 00:36:35,850
figure out how to,
how to actually get it done.

836
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,980
There's no,
there's no maybes.

837
00:36:37,981 --> 00:36:39,420
There's no close.
There's no.

838
00:36:39,421 --> 00:36:42,600
You get it done.
No one's helping you.

839
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,850
No one's helping you by yourself.
Yeah.

840
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:47,790
You enter into that ring is a referee in
there.

841
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:49,980
Guys just saved your life.
That's it.

842
00:36:49,981 --> 00:36:51,960
And then there's another dude and he 
weighs the same as,

843
00:36:51,961 --> 00:36:53,790
you know,
like taekwondo,

844
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:56,310
you guys get knocked down and kicked and
stuff,

845
00:36:56,311 --> 00:36:59,940
but you get a lot out of getting better 
at something,

846
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:01,740
you know,
especially when the stakes are high.

847
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:02,623
You certainly do.
But I think that if I had to do it all 

848
00:37:04,921 --> 00:37:05,754
over again,
like if I knew what I know now and I 

849
00:37:08,251 --> 00:37:10,350
went back and it was involved in 
striking sports,

850
00:37:10,351 --> 00:37:11,730
I'd be way more careful.

851
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:12,863
Way More careful about head kicks.
Know I kinda got lucky and dodged a lot 

852
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:19,140
of trauma,
but I know a lot of people who didn't.

853
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,910
A lot of a lot of kickboxers who just 
fought for nothing.

854
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:23,863
I enough.
I remember I thought it was cool when 

855
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:27,323
they'd go 30 seconds left in the whole 
gym would turn and watch me and Shannon 

856
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,033
Cohen plant our feet and just slug each 
other in the head and we get done like 

857
00:37:33,091 --> 00:37:34,650
high five.
They're not getting my cons.

858
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,020
Throw up chase and Shane would call me 
and go,

859
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:37,913
dude,
I forgot where I was going and at the 

860
00:37:39,271 --> 00:37:40,770
time were like,
gods you tomorrow.

861
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:42,690
See You tomorrow.
Meet head power.

862
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:46,320
Then we get in our cars and do it again.
The next day.

863
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:47,573
I remember playing football in college 
and there's a play called 96 power and 

864
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:53,010
then you'll bring in the shop bringing 
in the shop.

865
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,053
I'd come in,
it was me versus giant linebacker named 

866
00:37:56,371 --> 00:37:58,470
Brian [inaudible] who was a second round
or third round draft.

867
00:37:58,471 --> 00:37:59,304
Pick a nightmare and I take a running 
start and we'd run into each other and 

868
00:38:02,701 --> 00:38:06,560
everyone wait and stop.
That was my thing and I think of it not,

869
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,530
hey man,
I'm the front guy.

870
00:38:10,531 --> 00:38:12,870
If it's the civil war,
I'm the guy in the front of the idiot.

871
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:16,440
Watch this.
He sounds simone and simone.

872
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:19,050
No,
black is nine from Houston,

873
00:38:19,051 --> 00:38:20,430
Texas.
Close though,

874
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:21,423
right?
It makes you rethink things you've done 

875
00:38:24,091 --> 00:38:27,750
obviously in your past.
I look at earlier parts of my career,

876
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:30,090
all of my training,
I have a good chin.

877
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:35,390
Granted I fight child size grownups,
but the the lollipop guild

878
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:41,160
attacking you is another big of a deal,
but you will learn.

879
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,390
You fucking like Linux or Linux.
He hit me.

880
00:38:46,391 --> 00:38:50,690
It's fucking hard and I remember 
everything in the ring going Funky,

881
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:53,620
like fuck,
don't attack me right now.

882
00:38:53,621 --> 00:38:56,530
That hurt you.
I've been hit a lot.

883
00:38:56,531 --> 00:38:58,800
I put myself in the,
in the hospital snowboarding,

884
00:38:58,810 --> 00:38:59,990
hitting my head,
you know?

885
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:02,770
I've definitely had some brain that I 
wouldn't trade it though.

886
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:03,903
Yeah,
I wouldn't trade it for the one that I 

887
00:39:04,151 --> 00:39:05,800
would train different.
Exactly.

888
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:10,810
You guys are both okay right now.
Like you're not Muhammad Ali,

889
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:16,530
Joe Frazier in his the later years.
I think by the time you get old,

890
00:39:16,531 --> 00:39:17,710
they're gonna,
have some shit worked out,

891
00:39:17,711 --> 00:39:20,740
they're going to stick a fucking syringe
and your brain scored some stem cells in

892
00:39:20,741 --> 00:39:23,350
there and you're going to be good to go.
So I'm pretty sure.

893
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,080
I'm pretty sure they're,
they're getting real close.

894
00:39:26,081 --> 00:39:28,990
I mean they're getting real close to 
reengineering the entire human frame.

895
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:32,680
They're getting so close to every day 
that moved one step closer,

896
00:39:32,681 --> 00:39:33,514
but then 20,
30 years they're gonna have some cures 

897
00:39:35,741 --> 00:39:36,574
for all kinds of shit.
The problem is when you're already like 

898
00:39:38,681 --> 00:39:40,810
at Muhammad Ali's stage or Freddie 
Roach,

899
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,030
game over.
Yeah.

900
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:45,010
Freddie Roach has functional 
Parkinson's.

901
00:39:45,011 --> 00:39:46,960
That's from trauma and you know,
he,

902
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:48,710
he's open about it.
He was in war.

903
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:52,210
You watch this old fights.
That's why he stops fight sooner now.

904
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:54,010
Yep.
He's smart about it because he goes,

905
00:39:54,011 --> 00:39:56,140
I wish my coach would have stopped the 
fight sooner.

906
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:58,600
So now what was his last flight?
It was cody's like,

907
00:39:58,601 --> 00:40:00,080
I'm going to stop that.
You've got one more ram.

908
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:01,090
I'm going to stop this.
Well,

909
00:40:01,091 --> 00:40:03,190
the guy who fought Cova love.
What's his face?

910
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,053
The,
um,

911
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,770
uh,
the uh,

912
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:08,120
Canadian guy,
Pascal,

913
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:09,063
yes.
Sean,

914
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:13,270
John Pascoe who was just getting box was
doing nothing.

915
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,550
Well,
he was getting the therapy and go,

916
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:16,653
you know,
I think the first fight took a shitload 

917
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:19,923
out of him and that's something that 
people do not want to admit when you 

918
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:25,120
take the kind of beating that he took in
that first fight in the first fight,

919
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:29,270
arguably was called a hair soon.
But the,

920
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,593
but it's a hair mean.
His argument was that it was called two 

921
00:40:33,071 --> 00:40:33,904
students.
Got a great chance he should have been 

922
00:40:34,361 --> 00:40:34,940
able to fight.

923
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:37,180
He tagged him a few times.
She could have won that fight.

924
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:40,430
He did tag them a few times,
but he didn't tag him a few times.

925
00:40:40,431 --> 00:40:43,610
And that second find that second five 
was the coal Kovalev show.

926
00:40:43,611 --> 00:40:45,790
It wasn't even close,
straight up asked weapon.

927
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:49,090
He's a bad motherfucker.
Fucking scary murder to murder.

928
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,450
He's in and out.
He's fluid and you know what he likes to

929
00:40:52,451 --> 00:40:55,620
do for a strength and conditioning 
palladium movement.

930
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:59,710
Coach milady's does a lot of.
He's one of the hot ass in there.

931
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:02,560
He's trying to.
And in his wife,

932
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:04,300
the way you,
if you look at his body,

933
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:08,230
I don't know how he hits that heart is 
perfect technique,

934
00:41:08,231 --> 00:41:10,770
long,
long limbs and doing it for everybody.

935
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,633
It's like the body is one thing,
but the skeleton is the big skeleton is 

936
00:41:15,461 --> 00:41:19,120
a giant part of how a guy can punch and 
the size of the hands,

937
00:41:19,121 --> 00:41:20,320
the shape of the shoulders.

938
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,390
It's a huge,
huge factor.

939
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,300
What makes connor so good?
Look at KCI shoulders.

940
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:28,790
His shoulders or dude,
I'm a huge man.

941
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:33,410
I think he weighed at one 70,
71 78 right now he's,

942
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:36,440
he's,
he's that this week to make 70.

943
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,790
How about chocolate?
Chocolate.

944
00:41:37,791 --> 00:41:38,850
Dell.
He used to get us.

945
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:40,970
He'd get measured and he'd hold his 
shoulders in.

946
00:41:40,971 --> 00:41:41,804
So it said he was 76 inches when he's 
really 79 and he was standing next to 

947
00:41:46,491 --> 00:41:48,380
you and I was looking at what they do 
that because he wanted.

948
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:50,310
He didn't want you to know how long has 
reached out to Dick.

949
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:54,080
Fuck yeah,
come on.

950
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:55,470
We'll tell them to do that.
So,

951
00:41:55,570 --> 00:41:56,403
so that it says it reached 76 and if all
of a sudden it comes out with 79 inches 

952
00:41:59,721 --> 00:42:01,190
and he's jabbing you or whatever he's 
doing,

953
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:02,900
but you know,
I looked at him and,

954
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:03,763
and how,
how wide his shoulders were and how big 

955
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,520
he's walking around at 2:30.
Right.

956
00:42:07,521 --> 00:42:08,540
Motherfucker.
Yeah.

957
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:10,670
He's been talking crazy shit about Jon 
Jones.

958
00:42:10,671 --> 00:42:11,504
Just wait until he slaps you John's or a
chuck's big hands reaching the Gaza 

959
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,460
table lamp.
You're like,

960
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:16,323
what?
Yeah,

961
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:20,270
he thinks he would give Jon Jones 
trouble right now.

962
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:22,340
He's a fighter.
He'll do it.

963
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,450
It's just that idea of fighter.
That's this thing in his head.

964
00:42:26,451 --> 00:42:28,640
I mean he's,
he's still hits the bag and you know,

965
00:42:28,641 --> 00:42:30,490
he still has power and he still thinks 
that if he.

966
00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:33,650
I think his exact words were,
if I hit him right now,

967
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:35,660
if I put my hands on him,
I'd give him trouble.

968
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,540
He said his style would give John Fritz.
Yeah.

969
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:41,990
And he said that John wouldn't be able 
to out wrestle him,

970
00:42:41,991 --> 00:42:44,600
which was like,
that's tough.

971
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:45,800
It's tough.
Well,

972
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:46,700
what are you going to say?
The guy.

973
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:49,160
The guy's a fucking legend.
I can't disrespect.

974
00:42:49,161 --> 00:42:54,161
He's retired and he been in some crazy 
ass wars and it's over.

975
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:56,000
He's earned that.
So it's.

976
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:58,630
He's earned the right.
Yeah.

977
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:00,890
He's earned the right to talk some shit.
And you know,

978
00:43:00,891 --> 00:43:01,724
John John had to respond a little bit,
but either way employed John responded 

979
00:43:05,631 --> 00:43:07,490
was actually pretty kind.
Yeah.

980
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:08,463
You know,
he said maybe if truck fought a little 

981
00:43:09,291 --> 00:43:10,880
smarter.
We protected his chin.

982
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:12,230
He also just put,
oh,

983
00:43:12,231 --> 00:43:17,231
chuck class.
That is going to be fun.

984
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:19,360
Him and Cormier.
You too.

985
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:22,010
So it's going to be very fun.
Did you see the photoshops?

986
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:27,340
Yes.
So tyrone and funny super funny TV show.

987
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:32,000
No,
no.

988
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,770
That fucking circle.
Yes.

989
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:35,101
No,
it's the same guy,

990
00:43:35,101 --> 00:43:36,930
but that's from die hard.
Yeah.

991
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,390
So when he's a cop.
So funny.

992
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:41,450
What's your weight back and forth to 
each other and love it.

993
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:45,320
What do you guys think of a home tape?
It's a good fight.

994
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:47,930
It's a different fight.
Holly Holm,

995
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:50,930
first of all,
is she's first of all,

996
00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:51,823
without a doubt,
the best striker in that fucking 

997
00:43:54,141 --> 00:43:54,974
division.
No one moves like her knew her 

998
00:43:56,811 --> 00:44:00,170
athleticism,
her footwork or kicks in,

999
00:44:00,171 --> 00:44:01,004
you know,
the way she's conservative with that 

1000
00:44:02,241 --> 00:44:03,074
head kick to.
She waits till she knows it's time and 

1001
00:44:04,731 --> 00:44:07,020
then Bob,
she doesn't waste time on it.

1002
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:10,910
I can just throw it into the calculator.
She lands it.

1003
00:44:10,911 --> 00:44:15,080
That's fucking step to neck.
Oh so,

1004
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:16,850
so good.
And if you look at our highlight reel,

1005
00:44:16,851 --> 00:44:20,230
it's all that in other smaller 
organizations with UFC.

1006
00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:23,290
But misha tate fights with a lot of 
pressures.

1007
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,570
Toughest Shit.
Her grappling is really good.

1008
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:27,320
Super Gritty.
She's reading,

1009
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:32,510
she's got singles and doubles.
We just close the door she's got.

1010
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,110
But here's one thing she has to do.
She,

1011
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:38,850
she can't run in like what Rhonda did is
play right into the strengths of holly.

1012
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:43,320
Holly's a fantastic counter striker and 
Rhonda just wanted to overwhelm her with

1013
00:44:43,321 --> 00:44:44,154
pressure and power and take her out.
And she got cracked early and often and 

1014
00:44:48,181 --> 00:44:49,014
by the end of the first round she was 
like seeing tweety birds and all kinds 

1015
00:44:52,111 --> 00:44:52,944
of shit.
She probably had no idea what the fuck 

1016
00:44:53,551 --> 00:44:54,780
was going on.
Me.

1017
00:44:54,781 --> 00:44:56,770
She's not going to fight like that.
She is not,

1018
00:44:56,771 --> 00:44:57,604
she can't,
she's going to fight hands up high and 

1019
00:44:59,191 --> 00:45:00,024
she's gonna,
she's gonna fight more conservative and 

1020
00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:04,740
I keep going into the Raquel Pennington 
flight,

1021
00:45:04,741 --> 00:45:05,574
which was holly's first fight in UFC,
which she won a very close split 

1022
00:45:08,431 --> 00:45:11,970
decision and it's not taking anything 
away from Raquel because Raquel is a bad

1023
00:45:11,971 --> 00:45:12,804
ass bitch.

1024
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:14,410
All due respect.
To recap,

1025
00:45:14,530 --> 00:45:16,060
you'll see jitter son.
Yeah,

1026
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:17,023
UFC jitters are a big factor.
I think that probably played a big 

1027
00:45:20,641 --> 00:45:21,474
factor,
but also raquel's just real tough and 

1028
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:25,380
real smart and you know,
didn't rush in.

1029
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:26,273
I think the rushing.
In fact there was a big part of that 

1030
00:45:28,981 --> 00:45:31,740
fight.
Ronda just charging straightforward like

1031
00:45:31,741 --> 00:45:35,850
fucking wild animal and then holly 
moving and craft the worst.

1032
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:39,000
And what do you do with a technician?
What do you do?

1033
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:39,863
You make it a fricking gritty fight.
That's what mister blancher and I don't 

1034
00:45:43,441 --> 00:45:44,274
know if she's gonna win that clench.
She's not going to get for her to shoot 

1035
00:45:46,711 --> 00:45:50,100
a double or a single from that distance.
You're going to get sprawled on.

1036
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:54,210
You can training be a.
no one's taken holly down.

1037
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,920
You have no one's taken it down,
but you can get.

1038
00:45:55,921 --> 00:45:57,810
You look at the previous three fights in
the UFC.

1039
00:45:57,810 --> 00:45:58,643
People can get her to the cage,
but then then you got an a clench and I 

1040
00:46:01,081 --> 00:46:03,390
think holly is stronger than me.
Misha,

1041
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:05,100
I mean it's going to take over her.
Well,

1042
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:06,960
I don't know about the wrestling aspect 
stronger.

1043
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:09,450
I mean she hits harder,
but my friend Justin,

1044
00:46:09,570 --> 00:46:11,580
Justin Milo,
Suzanne Brown belt,

1045
00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:13,710
you know,
division one wrestler,

1046
00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:17,370
serious fucking athlete.
He said that holly feels like a dude.

1047
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:18,653
He said he rolled with both of them.
You both enrolled with holly and with 

1048
00:46:21,181 --> 00:46:23,070
Rhonda and he's like,
there's no comparison.

1049
00:46:23,071 --> 00:46:25,420
It's like holly as strong as fuck.
See it?

1050
00:46:25,730 --> 00:46:26,970
He's like,
she's really strong.

1051
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:29,040
I think holly winds.
I just think it's a different fight.

1052
00:46:29,041 --> 00:46:31,860
It's a tougher fight for holly.
The different puzzle to figure it out.

1053
00:46:31,861 --> 00:46:33,200
It's all about match ups.
Yeah,

1054
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:34,043
I don't.
I don't think that she gets destroyed 

1055
00:46:35,161 --> 00:46:35,994
like Rhonda did.
I don't think she gets out class like 

1056
00:46:37,291 --> 00:46:37,740
Rhonda did.

1057
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:40,770
I think it's a closer fight,
but holly still comes out on top.

1058
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:41,400
Well,
you know,

1059
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,920
the other thing is that holly went 
through camp for Rhonda,

1060
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:46,020
like no camp.
Chevron went through before and she said

1061
00:46:46,021 --> 00:46:48,300
she trained so fucking hard for that and
you see the results of that.

1062
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,030
I think she's going to do the exact same
thing for this camp.

1063
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:52,043
So if she goes into this fight with that
same kind of training camp behind her 

1064
00:46:55,950 --> 00:46:58,170
and it's just in fucking phenomenal 
shape.

1065
00:46:58,171 --> 00:47:00,630
Like she was for Ronda Rousey,
which she is.

1066
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:01,493
She might box that shit out.
There's more pressure on holly now 

1067
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:05,620
because we exchanged there to be,
you know,

1068
00:47:05,621 --> 00:47:07,500
she's this,
it's not a one time thing.

1069
00:47:07,501 --> 00:47:10,740
She wasn't a one trick pony.
She wants to just a flash in the pan.

1070
00:47:10,890 --> 00:47:13,080
I think for her there's more pressure to
perform now.

1071
00:47:13,590 --> 00:47:14,910
Rhonda,
she was such a big underdog.

1072
00:47:14,910 --> 00:47:15,560
He's like,
Eh,

1073
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:17,700
she wasn't getting mercked beats the 
fuck out of it.

1074
00:47:17,701 --> 00:47:18,534
Now we're like,
damn polly's for reals now there's 

1075
00:47:20,101 --> 00:47:21,230
pressure on her.
Maybe.

1076
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:22,670
Maybe,
but she's happy.

1077
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:25,620
She's in 19.
Type this my man.

1078
00:47:25,770 --> 00:47:29,040
What about women's boxing lot?
When's the thing we watched it exactly.

1079
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:31,330
It's in the high school auditorium.
A big deal for her though.

1080
00:47:31,331 --> 00:47:32,164
She's still there.
Not saying that you're not doing press 

1081
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:35,250
counter.
You're not the champion.

1082
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:37,660
You don't have everyone ready how he's 
ready for this,

1083
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:40,990
but another thing is taking pressure off
is that most people are paying attention

1084
00:47:40,991 --> 00:47:43,150
to connor for this fight,
for this fight.

1085
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:45,820
They're talking to her a little bit.
Percent is the condom mcgregor show.

1086
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:47,820
Let me ask you guys this question,
the rest of the car,

1087
00:47:47,821 --> 00:47:51,510
but this is a weird question.
Good fights will pull up the car at this

1088
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,050
good fights is a great card.

1089
00:47:53,230 --> 00:47:55,480
He's not just a good car for those car 
show though.

1090
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:57,490
It's the connor show,
but let's pull up this car.

1091
00:47:57,491 --> 00:47:58,324
Jamie.
There's a fucking bunch of good fights 

1092
00:47:59,921 --> 00:48:01,390
on this car.
No,

1093
00:48:01,450 --> 00:48:04,330
here's one that everyone's sleeping on.
Amanda Nunez.

1094
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:06,880
That is the dark horse as the division 
friends.

1095
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:10,000
Amanda Nunez is a fucking knockout 
machine.

1096
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:12,130
She is tough as fuck.
Right.

1097
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:17,180
Stretching she's taken on is Valentina.
She's a chick who was tough as fuck too,

1098
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:21,490
and a multiple time world Moitai fight 
for it.

1099
00:48:21,491 --> 00:48:23,050
Let's calm down on that.
A posture though,

1100
00:48:23,051 --> 00:48:24,010
Hon.
Valentino.

1101
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:25,290
No,
she's Russian Bros.

1102
00:48:25,330 --> 00:48:28,360
That's true.
You've goT a fucking dumb shit.

1103
00:48:28,390 --> 00:48:29,260
Excuse me.
Curgas.

1104
00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:31,303
Amanda,
as soon as I mentioned he has is so 

1105
00:48:32,621 --> 00:48:34,600
athletic and her striking.
She's bad ass.

1106
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:36,740
She's a bucking hard.
She's fit.

1107
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:39,570
She hits fucking hard.
I watched that.

1108
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:44,180
Sara mcmann fight again.
She's got a listing of a right hand.

1109
00:48:44,350 --> 00:48:47,410
She might be the biggest one.
Punch striker in that division.

1110
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,830
She's tough as fuck,
but You know,

1111
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:54,490
you look at her and then you look at the
entire division.

1112
00:48:54,491 --> 00:48:55,324
I think it's this.
This fight is a big fight for her 

1113
00:48:57,191 --> 00:49:00,640
because valentina,
she also went through her ufc jitters.

1114
00:49:00,790 --> 00:49:01,623
She was like real stiff and awkward and 
she was telling herself that in between 

1115
00:49:05,291 --> 00:49:06,124
rounds in her first fight.
I don't think she's going to be like 

1116
00:49:08,201 --> 00:49:09,190
that.
Coming into this fight.

1117
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:10,540
Good striking.
Look.

1118
00:49:10,541 --> 00:49:11,790
Good.
Here's another fighter,

1119
00:49:11,791 --> 00:49:15,760
but he's sleeping on your boy.
Brandon thatch and bought her designer.

1120
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:19,810
That's a good loser.
History papers you think so?

1121
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:22,390
I wouldn't give either one of these guys
are walking papers.

1122
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:24,810
You're not joseph.
They're both exciting to watch.

1123
00:49:24,850 --> 00:49:27,100
Fuck yeah.
These are great fighters.

1124
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:30,280
I agree.
A car by her disease.

1125
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:31,503
Yeah.
So he hasn't been almost two years time 

1126
00:49:34,031 --> 00:49:34,300
off.

1127
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:35,860
He got hurt.
What happened to them?

1128
00:49:35,861 --> 00:49:36,694
Do you not sure.
I know he got hurt and then thatches 

1129
00:49:37,950 --> 00:49:40,210
lost two in a row,
but they're too short notice.

1130
00:49:40,211 --> 00:49:43,540
Fights get a change in gunner nelson and
they had to fight ben henderson.

1131
00:49:43,570 --> 00:49:45,640
YEah,
well he got clipped and the nelson fight

1132
00:49:45,710 --> 00:49:47,800
gunner surprised him with that left 
hook.

1133
00:49:48,370 --> 00:49:50,140
That was a big punch and then submitted 
them.

1134
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:52,720
That was a big fight though,
man.

1135
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:55,390
I'm telling you.
If people could see him in the gym,

1136
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:56,141
it's like,
dude,

1137
00:49:56,141 --> 00:49:58,710
what the fuck is he too big here?
He's incredibly.

1138
00:49:58,720 --> 00:49:59,553
He's not too big.
He's always been a discipline issue for 

1139
00:50:02,201 --> 00:50:06,220
him and it's always been izzy in the 
fight because nico see you can't man.

1140
00:50:06,221 --> 00:50:08,080
You just can't have a night off and 
beat.

1141
00:50:08,081 --> 00:50:08,914
Gunnar nelson.
You can't not be focused and being a 

1142
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:14,620
striking range of a top 10 or top 15,
you know,

1143
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:15,483
guy and not get knocked out.
But in losing all that weight to get 

1144
00:50:18,131 --> 00:50:19,780
down to one 70,
what does he walk around at?

1145
00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:21,910
He's a one 90.
That's it?

1146
00:50:21,970 --> 00:50:22,900
Yeah.
He's but shredded.

1147
00:50:22,930 --> 00:50:24,610
He looks so big.
No shredding.

1148
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,500
He looks like he's a light heavyweight.
He's tall,

1149
00:50:26,501 --> 00:50:28,550
but he's thin,
but he has a lot of muscle.

1150
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:29,450
Yeah,
I'm serious.

1151
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:32,330
I look at him and he looks to me almost 
like a light heavyweight.

1152
00:50:34,410 --> 00:50:37,040
One 85 I'm telling is not a light 
heavyweight.

1153
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:37,530
No,
I believe.

1154
00:50:37,530 --> 00:50:39,570
Yeah.
Well obviously he's fighting at one 70.

1155
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:40,670
Makes it weight.
Yeah,

1156
00:50:40,671 --> 00:50:41,504
but you never seen a fight.
He does seem so relaxed before the 

1157
00:50:44,451 --> 00:50:45,284
fight,
like it might be with the way he deals 

1158
00:50:46,041 --> 00:50:46,874
with nerves,
but he's almost like talking to people 

1159
00:50:49,011 --> 00:50:51,890
and he looks way more casual than most.
Holy shit.

1160
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,530
Go back to that.
Grew up really early.

1161
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:58,330
Pre jim miller and diego fucking 
sanchez.

1162
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:02,630
Was that a prelim fight?
That's early prelims.

1163
00:51:02,631 --> 00:51:05,690
That's son.
How is the.

1164
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:08,930
Trying to get that ufC pass?
Trying to get everybody to buy ufc fight

1165
00:51:08,931 --> 00:51:12,620
pass and diego sanchez versus jim miller
is a great way to get that done.

1166
00:51:12,621 --> 00:51:16,370
My third fight of the night folks.
Ooh,

1167
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:19,160
diego sAnchez is such a fucking 
barbarian.

1168
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,470
If that guy was put on this earth to do 
one thing,

1169
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:22,820
to go to war,
it's true.

1170
00:51:22,910 --> 00:51:26,090
He's such an animal that's doing.
don't sleep.

1171
00:51:26,510 --> 00:51:29,570
Don't sleep on their syllabus to leave.
Exactly.

1172
00:51:29,571 --> 00:51:31,520
That's another good fight.
That's a very good.

1173
00:51:31,521 --> 00:51:35,150
Nor dean to leaves a bad motherfucker 
first team all body.

1174
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:37,310
Eric silva fell off well.
Yeah.

1175
00:51:37,311 --> 00:51:39,560
He til he took his spot.
His body's changed a little bit.

1176
00:51:39,710 --> 00:51:40,543
Oh,
what at all?

1177
00:51:40,750 --> 00:51:42,020
Well,
I don't want to talk about it,

1178
00:51:42,021 --> 00:51:42,854
but he didn't lose his apple bottom and 
he doesn't seem quite as shredded as 

1179
00:51:45,610 --> 00:51:47,390
wonder If he would pass the smell test.

1180
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:52,040
Yeah.
He was a shredded animal before.

1181
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,950
Is it freaky looking at one point in 
time?

1182
00:51:54,951 --> 00:51:57,350
He was ridiculous.
They probably a lot of flights.

1183
00:51:57,710 --> 00:51:59,120
Um,
I don't think so.

1184
00:51:59,121 --> 00:51:59,990
Dude.
I think he was.

1185
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:03,050
I don't know what you're talking about.
There have been 20 pounds of red meat.

1186
00:52:03,051 --> 00:52:05,120
There was some stuff that he realized it
was clocking his colon.

1187
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:07,940
He lives in a country where you can just
get that stuff.

1188
00:52:07,970 --> 00:52:08,950
Sure.
A lot of funny.

1189
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:11,080
That gives a lot of capital.
Minerals.

1190
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:14,030
Yeah.
I say when I say a lot of beef,

1191
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:15,770
it's interesting watching all this 
happen though,

1192
00:52:15,771 --> 00:52:17,570
isn't it?
Watched some guys bodies change.

1193
00:52:17,571 --> 00:52:18,404
Watching their performance has changed.
I like it because it doesn't make me 

1194
00:52:20,691 --> 00:52:21,524
feel as bad about my body and I liked 
the word as you're still the ufc 

1195
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:30,960
fighters as not as bad.
How about the.

1196
00:52:31,110 --> 00:52:34,690
How about the old police on telly,
but he's a stud stud.

1197
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:35,533
Yeah.
Strangulations on your wrong 

1198
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:38,960
motherfucker.
No police.

1199
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:42,240
Strong motherfucker.
Shop haircut.

1200
00:52:42,270 --> 00:52:44,550
He's 20 buddies from France.
I don't know if I can,

1201
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:48,720
can get behind french.
Arabic text my boy.

1202
00:52:48,770 --> 00:52:49,603
He's arabic.
Who is noxious shit and just going to 

1203
00:52:52,881 --> 00:52:54,020
bring up my friends.
I don't know man.

1204
00:52:54,930 --> 00:52:55,763
Who iS that guy that uh,
george st pierre brought in with him to 

1205
00:52:58,701 --> 00:53:00,980
train these drugs.
My friend cigarettes.

1206
00:53:00,981 --> 00:53:02,780
Yeah,
the french moitai guy.

1207
00:53:02,781 --> 00:53:05,600
He's a bad motherfucker.
John something or another.

1208
00:53:05,601 --> 00:53:07,310
I forget his name.
I forget them too.

1209
00:53:07,311 --> 00:53:09,320
But on the ultimate fighter,
george told everyone,

1210
00:53:09,350 --> 00:53:10,940
man,
if you're sparring with this guy,

1211
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:12,960
don't fucking hit him hard man.
PiSs them off.

1212
00:53:12,961 --> 00:53:13,590
We're gonna.
Be in trouble.

1213
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:14,480
Yeah,
be nice.

1214
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:16,420
Meanwhile,
he,

1215
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:20,990
he has the ultimate dad bod that guys 
that need a dad bod,

1216
00:53:21,010 --> 00:53:26,010
so dad by yellow cab looks like yellow 
bass from cincinnati and who is this?

1217
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:29,783
Who is this more thai champion that 
george st pierre brought belly smokes 

1218
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:36,150
on.
Stuff that his name.

1219
00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:40,020
he was kicking the shit out of.
Smelled like booze.

1220
00:53:40,021 --> 00:53:41,070
He'd come in drunk.
Oh yeah.

1221
00:53:41,071 --> 00:53:44,610
He would come in drunk like up all night
partying.

1222
00:53:44,670 --> 00:53:45,503
Just going to eat like a title or the 
dutch or the dutch or french apparently 

1223
00:53:49,141 --> 00:53:51,960
to just all night in vegas.
GoIng to parties,

1224
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:52,853
having a good time and then fucking 
these young tough kids up during the 

1225
00:53:58,050 --> 00:53:59,160
day.
You know what man,

1226
00:53:59,161 --> 00:54:01,980
all that crazy behavior that these guys 
used to engage in,

1227
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:04,710
you know,
can't get away with too many cell phones

1228
00:54:04,711 --> 00:54:07,020
these days.
Like if theSe guys are trying to do that

1229
00:54:07,021 --> 00:54:10,660
today,
trying to go out and johnny Manziel that

1230
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:11,760
player,
he was a heisman winner.

1231
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:15,150
First round draft pick.
The dude likes to party.

1232
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:17,430
He likes to party so much.
Cleveland browns like,

1233
00:54:17,431 --> 00:54:18,630
yo,
if you party man,

1234
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:19,560
we're going to cut you.

1235
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:20,813
This fucking guy goes to vegas under a 
hidden name and wears a wig and a 

1236
00:54:24,691 --> 00:54:28,530
mustache.
He looks like everyone's like,

1237
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:29,393
oh,
that's johnny manziel,

1238
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:35,100
and then it goes online and cleveland 
browns that is going to get cut.

1239
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:39,900
He doeSn't do it with a mustache and me.
I'm telling you,

1240
00:54:40,170 --> 00:54:44,580
johnny manziel,
he partied with a.

1241
00:54:44,581 --> 00:54:48,030
Which is this the guy that's him.
He was a stud.

1242
00:54:48,450 --> 00:54:51,810
Football college,
partied in a blonde wig,

1243
00:54:51,811 --> 00:54:54,900
fake mustache glass.
How can they tell you you can't party.

1244
00:54:55,170 --> 00:54:58,860
This is what they can tell you.
Your performance was unsatisfactory.

1245
00:54:58,861 --> 00:55:00,450
Your cut.
That's what they can tell you.

1246
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:02,460
They can't tell you.
You can't go and have a good time.

1247
00:55:02,461 --> 00:55:03,360
This was a problem.
Joe.

1248
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:05,700
What?
He's partying every fucking night.

1249
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:06,840
What have you.
Drinking water.

1250
00:55:06,990 --> 00:55:08,100
What have you.
He just likes to dance,

1251
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:09,740
so it's part of his cardio.
Now.

1252
00:55:09,741 --> 00:55:10,020
He haS.

1253
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:12,560
he's actually an alcoholic.
He's been in and out of rehab.

1254
00:55:12,610 --> 00:55:15,420
If he's got a movement coach and 
movement coach wants them to like you're

1255
00:55:15,421 --> 00:55:20,421
talking to step on the desk.
So that's how you fucking movement.

1256
00:55:21,091 --> 00:55:24,230
Coach troll.
The other day I was howling.

1257
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:26,930
What did you say?
What was your exact quote you believe in

1258
00:55:27,020 --> 00:55:28,600
said,
if you think instance,

1259
00:55:28,601 --> 00:55:31,140
it was going to beat michael bisbing a 
decision the uk.

1260
00:55:31,141 --> 00:55:34,100
Then you obviously believe in dragons 
and moving coaches.

1261
00:55:35,070 --> 00:55:36,710
People got mad at you because they were 
so mad.

1262
00:55:36,711 --> 00:55:39,920
They were like dragons exist to do.
There's Plenty of evidence now.

1263
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:40,773
They got mad at a movement coach.
Thing is they think I'm hitting on 

1264
00:55:42,331 --> 00:55:43,230
conor.
I'm not at all.

1265
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:45,440
We're a port.
Wasn't a porto porto.

1266
00:55:45,570 --> 00:55:47,220
I'm not at all.
Not at all.

1267
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:49,500
Connor's fans are the most fucking 
easily,

1268
00:55:49,501 --> 00:55:52,230
but her people ever.
I talk so much shit on everybody else,

1269
00:55:52,231 --> 00:55:53,970
rhonda,
all this stuff and I get some stuff.

1270
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:56,340
All I said about connor said,
hey,

1271
00:55:56,341 --> 00:55:58,260
guess what frankie edgar's coming for 
you.

1272
00:55:58,710 --> 00:56:00,000
He didn't say anything.
Of course.

1273
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:03,510
I had so many asshole fans.
I don't know what country they were from

1274
00:56:03,511 --> 00:56:04,560
or what,
but right Ireland,

1275
00:56:04,561 --> 00:56:05,460
buddy.
Fuck you.

1276
00:56:05,461 --> 00:56:06,300
You piece of shit.

1277
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:12,860
They say,
fuck with two o's for.

1278
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:14,713
Fuck you.
I've never had such an onslaught of f 

1279
00:56:19,190 --> 00:56:23,100
just shit talking because I said that 
you have a fight.

1280
00:56:23,910 --> 00:56:24,100
There's

1281
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:24,933
an identity thing going on there.
They're identifying with thiS guy in a 

1282
00:56:27,431 --> 00:56:28,264
way that you remember when you were a 
kid and I don't know how it was with 

1283
00:56:31,661 --> 00:56:32,494
you,
but when I was a kid I would identify 

1284
00:56:34,001 --> 00:56:37,810
with a fighter fighter lost.
I was devastated and I remember that day

1285
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:41,290
I let it go.
Donald curry for mike mccallum and I was

1286
00:56:41,291 --> 00:56:42,124
at giant tunnel curry fan man.
I love Donald Curry and mike mcowen hit 

1287
00:56:45,341 --> 00:56:46,174
him with a low blow left hook to the 
body and then a left hook up top and 

1288
00:56:49,661 --> 00:56:52,810
shut the lights out and he went fucking 
flat backwards,

1289
00:56:52,811 --> 00:56:55,750
arms over the top of his head and I went
fuck.

1290
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:59,830
And I put on my running shoes and I went
out running and I ran a couple miles and

1291
00:56:59,831 --> 00:57:00,664
I remember when I came back home I said,
I have never getting upset over some 

1292
00:57:04,181 --> 00:57:05,050
fucking dude.

1293
00:57:05,050 --> 00:57:10,050
I don't even know losing ever again.
I'm just gonna enjoy the fights.

1294
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:13,120
So like to this day,
like when I call fights,

1295
00:57:13,121 --> 00:57:16,560
unless it's like you fucking guys.
Luckily you're not doing it anymore,

1296
00:57:16,810 --> 00:57:19,270
but you when you fucking fight or 
someone I care about,

1297
00:57:19,271 --> 00:57:20,470
it's hard,
you know,

1298
00:57:20,471 --> 00:57:22,860
because I'm trying not to be,
but when I'm watching,

1299
00:57:22,861 --> 00:57:26,290
if I watched like anderson and bisping,
I'm wanting to watch a fight,

1300
00:57:26,470 --> 00:57:27,940
I want to see what happens.
I don't have,

1301
00:57:27,950 --> 00:57:29,900
I don't have a dog in the race.
I want to see.

1302
00:57:29,930 --> 00:57:32,770
And if anderson knocks amount or bisbing
knocks him out,

1303
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:34,210
you don't care.
I liked the performance.

1304
00:57:34,211 --> 00:57:35,680
I like watching a performance.
Yes.

1305
00:57:36,110 --> 00:57:41,110
It changed for me at that day.
I remember remind myself my brother was.

1306
00:57:42,070 --> 00:57:42,903
We went into fighting.
I thought john claude van damme was the 

1307
00:57:44,921 --> 00:57:46,180
man.
I thought that shit was real.

1308
00:57:46,410 --> 00:57:46,840
He is.

1309
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:48,160
And was.
He still is.

1310
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:50,180
Yeah.
But for me it was his head.

1311
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:52,480
Mine was.
Mine was magic johnson,

1312
00:57:52,481 --> 00:57:53,680
my brothers,
Michael Jordan.

1313
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:54,753
When magic johnson got aids,
I started crying and my mom had to 

1314
00:57:57,431 --> 00:57:58,264
explain to a young man both,
and guys like that don't just represent 

1315
00:58:03,401 --> 00:58:05,800
a conor mcgregor,
doesn't just represent himself.

1316
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:07,870
Conor mcgregor represents a couple of 
things.

1317
00:58:07,871 --> 00:58:11,290
One is possibility like self belief and 
the idea,

1318
00:58:11,291 --> 00:58:12,124
the gall to say that I'm going to be a 
champion coming out of nowhere and do 

1319
00:58:15,071 --> 00:58:15,904
it,
but also like you have to look at where 

1320
00:58:17,251 --> 00:58:18,084
he like Ireland.
They did a really interesting thing 

1321
00:58:19,841 --> 00:58:20,674
about this during the financial crisis.
LIke what the greeks and people taking 

1322
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:25,810
to the streets and you know,
freaking out.

1323
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:28,780
The irish are quiet,
suffers.

1324
00:58:28,781 --> 00:58:32,200
The irish are very stoic people.
They don't show off.

1325
00:58:32,530 --> 00:58:36,550
they don't make a big deal about their 
own issues and pain.

1326
00:58:36,550 --> 00:58:39,400
IT's very an irish.
You get a guy like conor mcgregor all of

1327
00:58:39,401 --> 00:58:43,120
a sudden to come and they've had the 
shit end of the stick for a lot of their

1328
00:58:43,121 --> 00:58:43,954
history.
And so when you get a guy like conor 

1329
00:58:45,551 --> 00:58:46,810
mcgregor to come along and go,
hey,

1330
00:58:46,811 --> 00:58:47,644
by the way,
I'm going to beat everybody and I'm 

1331
00:58:48,911 --> 00:58:50,710
fucking irish.
Who else did I help?

1332
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:54,490
So I'm taking over for the for the first
time in a long time,

1333
00:58:54,491 --> 00:58:58,300
the irish like not holy fuck this guy 
speaking for us.

1334
00:58:58,390 --> 00:59:01,060
And by the way,
unifying us that that's a big.

1335
00:59:01,150 --> 00:59:02,950
Historically,
he's actually,

1336
00:59:02,951 --> 00:59:05,120
in a lot of ways,
I'm probably gonna get shipped for this.

1337
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:10,060
He's historically significant to the 
irish and the irish character.

1338
00:59:10,061 --> 00:59:12,640
You're not that at all.
I think you're entirely right.

1339
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:13,510
It's true.
I agree.

1340
00:59:13,510 --> 00:59:17,440
There's a reason it's so loud and stuff 
because he is.

1341
00:59:17,441 --> 00:59:18,000
He's,
he's,

1342
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,030
he's the guy who said,
hey,

1343
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:22,070
it's our turn and who says we haVe to be
quiet and

1344
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:23,200
keep our heads down?
Shit.

1345
00:59:23,210 --> 00:59:24,730
That's the real estate agents about god.
Damn.

1346
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:28,160
When I went to Ireland a fight,
and this was connors.

1347
00:59:28,161 --> 00:59:29,870
What?
Second third fight in the ufc.

1348
00:59:29,990 --> 00:59:32,270
I think it was second he eating.
People knew who he was.

1349
00:59:32,570 --> 00:59:33,680
They obviously,
they had the show.

1350
00:59:33,681 --> 00:59:36,380
He's headlining.
I get there.

1351
00:59:36,590 --> 00:59:38,780
Wander around getting a cab.
Oh.

1352
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:40,041
Oh,
you're fighting.

1353
00:59:40,041 --> 00:59:40,581
Okay.
Oh yeah,

1354
00:59:40,581 --> 00:59:42,060
here for connor,
like,

1355
00:59:42,710 --> 00:59:44,060
Uh,
sure.

1356
00:59:44,061 --> 00:59:46,640
Yeah.
I'm FuCking here for connor fighting.

1357
00:59:46,790 --> 00:59:47,451
I'm like,
okay,

1358
00:59:47,451 --> 00:59:49,130
wait for it.
And finding an englishman.

1359
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:50,820
Fuck him.
Hope we die.

1360
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:53,960
I'm fucking.
What's her name?

1361
00:59:53,961 --> 00:59:54,591
Ian mccall.
Oh,

1362
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:55,910
you're a good irish boy.
Am I?

1363
00:59:55,970 --> 00:59:58,650
I'm not sure.
Okay.

1364
01:00:01,730 --> 01:00:06,730
They thought I was a fucking leprechaun 
or something and this was.

1365
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:13,100
This was just before he was a big,
big thing.

1366
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:17,780
they were already fucking behind him so 
much and now he is who he is.

1367
01:00:17,781 --> 01:00:18,500
Like you Said he

1368
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:20,850
is.
He is changing the game completely.

1369
01:00:20,930 --> 01:00:23,930
Second fight in the ufc I believe was in
boston.

1370
01:00:23,931 --> 01:00:26,360
I think it was the second fight and was 
the second fight.

1371
01:00:26,361 --> 01:00:28,730
Max holloway,
which was the second fight.

1372
01:00:29,110 --> 01:00:29,943
None of that.
The first fight was the first one was 

1373
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:34,160
berman.
Whatever the fight was that I called.

1374
01:00:34,161 --> 01:00:35,430
I don't believe I called his first 
fight.

1375
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:37,820
I think I called the second time,
but I remember being there going,

1376
01:00:37,821 --> 01:00:38,631
this is nuts,
man.

1377
01:00:38,631 --> 01:00:39,464
This guy is on the undercard.
He's on the undercard loud and they're 

1378
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:42,853
going fucking crazy and I think it's 
because also boston is a giant irish 

1379
01:00:46,191 --> 01:00:47,024
community.
Right.

1380
01:00:47,270 --> 01:00:49,130
But there was just something about this 
guy.

1381
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:50,120
I was like,
this is nuts.

1382
01:00:50,121 --> 01:00:54,950
Like the momentum had already started,
like way more than anybody I'd ever seen

1383
01:00:54,951 --> 01:00:55,784
fighting on the undercard.
But another thing that's going on with 

1384
01:00:58,221 --> 01:00:59,054
connor is that everybody knows the 
stakes are much higher because of the 

1385
01:01:03,231 --> 01:01:03,980
shit talking.

1386
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:04,813
He does see all this shit.
Talking is fantastic when you pull it 

1387
01:01:08,031 --> 01:01:08,864
off,
but everybody knows that if he doesn't 

1388
01:01:10,911 --> 01:01:13,250
pull it off,
if nate fucking sleeps him.

1389
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:14,293
If nate connects with a straight left 
right hook and we see the fucking 

1390
01:01:17,230 --> 01:01:19,930
chicken,
you,

1391
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:23,110
but you better stay offline for a couple
of weeks.

1392
01:01:24,950 --> 01:01:26,150
Oh my gosh.
What?

1393
01:01:26,170 --> 01:01:28,850
I mean,
he's got to,

1394
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:31,010
aren't close anymore.
You don't talk to her,

1395
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:35,990
but I couldn't imagine which is what I 
saw when I was online.

1396
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:36,853
the barrage of hate got hate for rhonda,
for telling people she was great for 

1397
01:01:43,430 --> 01:01:45,620
expressing my,
my uh,

1398
01:01:46,490 --> 01:01:49,600
being impressed with her performance is 
the amount of hate.

1399
01:01:49,610 --> 01:01:54,280
She got different wave.
Just a fucking.

1400
01:01:55,110 --> 01:01:58,200
But it might be different though because
rhonda was such a,

1401
01:01:58,250 --> 01:02:00,660
she was not a very gracious winner,
you know,

1402
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:01,513
if you look at her,
which is climbing rocks and that 

1403
01:02:02,961 --> 01:02:05,450
competition in the ultimate fighter and 
she's given me the finger.

1404
01:02:05,870 --> 01:02:06,703
It was so aggressive and then did not 
shake her hand and then to say what she 

1405
01:02:09,921 --> 01:02:10,754
said about holly,
about being a fake ass preacher's 

1406
01:02:12,951 --> 01:02:15,380
daughter and stuff.
That kind of stuff wasn't windy.

1407
01:02:15,381 --> 01:02:17,480
It was just,
it was just a lot of venom.

1408
01:02:17,510 --> 01:02:18,470
It's very hurtful

1409
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:21,273
because then you're.
Then you're being a bully or being 

1410
01:02:22,330 --> 01:02:23,430
exonerated.
Bull exists.

1411
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:24,430
Fear,
you know,

1412
01:02:24,450 --> 01:02:26,790
people know that when she was doing that
with holly,

1413
01:02:26,791 --> 01:02:30,600
there was a fear and she was trying to 
put that fear in the holly and the worst

1414
01:02:30,601 --> 01:02:32,340
thing in the world is holly just 
standing out there,

1415
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:34,313
dead,
faced drinking her water and she didn't 

1416
01:02:35,791 --> 01:02:38,130
even their postage and all that.
That's cute.

1417
01:02:38,131 --> 01:02:42,030
ThIs judo is gonna.
Try and strike with me in the face,

1418
01:02:42,031 --> 01:02:44,640
bitch.
I like to use the word judoka.

1419
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:46,050
Here's a question.
You guys.

1420
01:02:46,051 --> 01:02:49,110
Who are fighters?
Who or what about this idea?

1421
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:49,973
What if,
what if meisha tate crawled on about a 

1422
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:55,073
three point stance.
Literally crawled toward holly home 

1423
01:02:58,140 --> 01:03:00,390
because she couldn't get kicks.
John jones style right,

1424
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:03,010
and just grabbed her ankle,
picked a single.

1425
01:03:03,150 --> 01:03:06,630
She won't be going to punch her.
she isn't a punch in the face.

1426
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:09,470
Kick her arms,
but god,

1427
01:03:09,570 --> 01:03:10,403
that's not a viable.
Let's down kick the shit out of those 

1428
01:03:14,311 --> 01:03:16,080
arms.
Let me tell you something to do,

1429
01:03:16,081 --> 01:03:18,420
to have you on all forms,
on all fours,

1430
01:03:18,421 --> 01:03:20,720
and someone kicks your arms.
That is horrific.

1431
01:03:20,790 --> 01:03:21,623
Great.
And your dumb ass to get up and fight 

1432
01:03:22,921 --> 01:03:24,320
with one guy.
Sorry.

1433
01:03:24,330 --> 01:03:25,460
I just might.
My staff strategy.

1434
01:03:25,630 --> 01:03:27,000
Any other.
Hold on.

1435
01:03:28,290 --> 01:03:30,170
She's probably listening me.
Shit.

1436
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:31,013
Don't do that.
It's climbed on top of the octagon and 

1437
01:03:33,751 --> 01:03:36,510
leapt to the center of the roof.
Misha has a knife.

1438
01:03:36,511 --> 01:03:37,500
Guys.
You ever thought about that?

1439
01:03:38,170 --> 01:03:41,780
You can't do that if nisha knows named 
jitsu golf.

1440
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:43,650
Sleeping dust.
Yeah.

1441
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:44,573
It's,
it's,

1442
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:47,910
there's not a whole lot of things that 
haven't been tried.

1443
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:48,840
Hey,
what if meesha,

1444
01:03:48,841 --> 01:03:51,510
one and Conor got knocked down like 15 
seconds.

1445
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:53,280
Whoa.
Does dana shed a tear?

1446
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:55,440
No.
Just keep on trucking.

1447
01:03:55,441 --> 01:03:56,370
Fuck you.

1448
01:03:56,550 --> 01:03:57,820
Keep on trucking.
Connor.

1449
01:03:57,821 --> 01:04:00,240
Still fucking welterweights or the 
featherweight champion?

1450
01:04:00,241 --> 01:04:02,580
Not the same.
Your shit crazy if you think.

1451
01:04:02,581 --> 01:04:03,360
No,
no.

1452
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:05,800
Not the same.
But look this.

1453
01:04:05,890 --> 01:04:08,190
The irish people are still going to 
support him 100 percent.

1454
01:04:08,230 --> 01:04:11,690
Finding a job.
It's not the same as god.

1455
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:14,820
He can win a rematch.
He's lost before he lost the Joe Duffy.

1456
01:04:14,850 --> 01:04:15,683
Not in the ufc.
We've never seen any loss to a 25 or he 

1457
01:04:18,850 --> 01:04:21,480
does that little russian guy who leg 
locked in with 20 minutes of them.

1458
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:23,760
Really?
That's you're livinG in the past though.

1459
01:04:23,761 --> 01:04:25,650
I'm talking now.
These are just mega superstar.

1460
01:04:25,651 --> 01:04:26,730
He said 25.
Oh really?

1461
01:04:27,330 --> 01:04:28,163
Wow.
Yeah,

1462
01:04:29,190 --> 01:04:30,790
it was a long time ago.
Long time.

1463
01:04:30,810 --> 01:04:32,610
Doesn't matter that they're talking 
about $25.

1464
01:04:32,611 --> 01:04:34,320
They could submit me,
you know,

1465
01:04:34,350 --> 01:04:37,920
get a hold of my shit.
Shit tat holding my legs.

1466
01:04:37,921 --> 01:04:39,630
See if you tap,

1467
01:04:40,050 --> 01:04:40,883

01:04:40,890 --> 01:04:41,723

if they get you in certain positions or 

1469
01:04:44,131 --> 01:04:45,750
certain positions that some guys have.

1470
01:04:45,930 --> 01:04:48,690
They catching it like ronnie yahya.
Oh man.

1471
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:51,330
That Guy has a whole year.
He's a tiny little dude.

1472
01:04:51,331 --> 01:04:54,570
He's also ultimate dad bod guy.
Tiny little dude.

1473
01:04:54,630 --> 01:04:57,720
First steve gets in,
gets a Hold of your team constrictor,

1474
01:04:57,780 --> 01:04:58,890
you know,
that's what they call themselves.

1475
01:04:59,100 --> 01:04:59,933
That is an app name because at that 
motherfucker gets a hold of your neck 

1476
01:05:02,521 --> 01:05:05,050
man.
You got some fucking problems live,

1477
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:07,260
paula.
Yeah.

1478
01:05:07,590 --> 01:05:08,423
Well,
you know paul was versus gary tonin and 

1479
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:12,530
that submission only match at polaris in
that motherfucker.

1480
01:05:12,610 --> 01:05:13,920
Yeah,
he's crazy.

1481
01:05:14,260 --> 01:05:15,093
He's getting paid well for that.
every tone in his favorite in that 

1482
01:05:17,390 --> 01:05:18,223
business carry tone.
That guy beat everybody at the eddie 

1483
01:05:19,841 --> 01:05:20,674
bravo.
He's the favorite favorite there and 

1484
01:05:22,650 --> 01:05:25,060
he's going to wrestle with pahara.
Don't say russell.

1485
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:27,160
I mean he's kind of grapple with 
submission,

1486
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:27,971
grappling,
match.

1487
01:05:27,971 --> 01:05:29,590
I don't know if they have a weight 
limitation,

1488
01:05:29,591 --> 01:05:30,424
which could be a giant issue because 
paul rs gets way up into the two 

1489
01:05:32,950 --> 01:05:33,783
hundreds before he fought.
He fought at one 85 his first fight in 

1490
01:05:35,750 --> 01:05:38,370
ufc testing.
What's going?

1491
01:05:38,450 --> 01:05:41,910
Make sure that what you mean.
You don't have time for that bullshit.

1492
01:05:41,930 --> 01:05:43,820
Time for testing.
They want you to be on stage.

1493
01:05:43,830 --> 01:05:44,663
I want to quit everything.
I want to do steroids and I want to do 

1494
01:05:45,941 --> 01:05:46,774
jujitsu all day and well,
how about fifth least diverse of all 

1495
01:05:48,950 --> 01:05:50,980
these tourists take up class?
No.

1496
01:05:50,981 --> 01:05:53,200
Just get on steroids and start entering 
competitions.

1497
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:56,193
I'm going to do and then lose.
I'm going to lose gracefully at the 

1498
01:05:59,081 --> 01:06:00,780
audit thing.
Just jump on the map.

1499
01:06:01,050 --> 01:06:05,210
We got to supermatch fucking loose 
genres.

1500
01:06:05,290 --> 01:06:07,560
They come off in the middle of rolling.
Exactly.

1501
01:06:07,860 --> 01:06:11,380
Gosh guys,
you're hogs.

1502
01:06:11,381 --> 01:06:14,200
Fucking wipe it all.
The mess that happened to combine guy.

1503
01:06:14,460 --> 01:06:16,170
We talked a little bit of it.
Came out.

1504
01:06:16,260 --> 01:06:17,093
Know the combine,
right?

1505
01:06:17,380 --> 01:06:19,430
Cannonball tights.
yeah.

1506
01:06:20,020 --> 01:06:20,853
Giant Black guy.
run the 40 fat ass pterodactyl dick 

1507
01:06:25,090 --> 01:06:25,923
comes out the front.
Even fucking falls in each shit on the 

1508
01:06:28,931 --> 01:06:33,100
turf.
It was set and look at this girl who was

1509
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:34,953
very excited.
It got a piece on The money when they 

1510
01:06:36,410 --> 01:06:37,243
blurted out how dear you out.
You've got to find the real deal out 

1511
01:06:41,231 --> 01:06:42,064
there.
Young james.

1512
01:06:42,230 --> 01:06:43,063
We got on the floor duty.
It looks like a pterodactyl going down 

1513
01:06:45,581 --> 01:06:48,040
for prey.
It's all blocked off.

1514
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:48,770
No,
no,

1515
01:06:48,770 --> 01:06:52,110
no.
It's like this weird fish consciousness.

1516
01:06:52,220 --> 01:06:54,400
Spirit out of the ground now.
Fuck that.

1517
01:06:54,430 --> 01:06:57,310
It's like on drastic park where the 
teradeks are taken care of.

1518
01:06:57,620 --> 01:06:58,850
Here go fullscreen,
son.

1519
01:06:58,870 --> 01:07:00,920
Let's see.
Let's get this in our face.

1520
01:07:00,921 --> 01:07:04,510
Six five comes out right here.
He's all.

1521
01:07:06,210 --> 01:07:07,510
He's like,
no.

1522
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:09,350
Oh shit.
My shit.

1523
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:10,313
That turf dick.
because he scraped that chocolate dick 

1524
01:07:12,161 --> 01:07:16,420
on that turf.
You'll see they let them do it again.

1525
01:07:16,530 --> 01:07:17,363
I hope so.

1526
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:26,000
He's.
Oh yes.

1527
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:30,673
I'm chris jones back in the heat.
You know how many instagram fucking 

1528
01:07:33,431 --> 01:07:35,190
pussy pictures he must've gotten.
Oh,

1529
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:37,540
you know what I mean?
Girls just sent his photos,

1530
01:07:37,541 --> 01:07:41,550
slid into his face down and also,
oh,

1531
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:44,260
you're that guy to make this happen.
You're the dick turf guy.

1532
01:07:44,350 --> 01:07:45,183
Let's make this happen.
Dick turf guy went before you run that 

1533
01:07:48,221 --> 01:07:48,760
comment,
like,

1534
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:49,990
what's the worst that can happen?
I don't know.

1535
01:07:49,991 --> 01:07:51,700
IT's not like you're going to come out 
or anything.

1536
01:07:51,701 --> 01:07:54,850
Just point here.
Volume of caulk when he was getting up,

1537
01:07:54,851 --> 01:07:56,500
but you see the mass.
Yeah.

1538
01:07:56,680 --> 01:07:58,870
Can you imagine how.
I don't know if you guys were at turf.

1539
01:07:58,871 --> 01:08:01,920
Burn on your dick.
Are you kidding me?

1540
01:08:01,950 --> 01:08:05,500
Heard a turf toe but choose to fall dick
first.

1541
01:08:05,501 --> 01:08:06,334
like that role though.
I definitely think he fell forward to 

1542
01:08:10,901 --> 01:08:13,240
cover his dick.
Probably he knew.

1543
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:15,220
If it came out of a short,
it was going to the ground.

1544
01:08:15,460 --> 01:08:18,380
Just let everybody see His dick.
If I had a dick like that,

1545
01:08:18,381 --> 01:08:20,410
I be fucking ripped my pants every day.
I'd be fine.

1546
01:08:20,420 --> 01:08:22,100
He falls down,
he gets up and tells the coach.

1547
01:08:22,101 --> 01:08:23,350
He goes,
my dick fell out like,

1548
01:08:23,630 --> 01:08:24,463
oh shit.
I just watched the get up freeze frame 

1549
01:08:26,421 --> 01:08:28,930
on this table.
We went to right to count.

1550
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:32,900
Fuck.
That's the problem.

1551
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:36,560
That dude needs one of them diamond cups
just to contain that.

1552
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:39,470
I don't see a problem with it.
There's no fucking sleeping.

1553
01:08:39,860 --> 01:08:40,693
Tells the coach goes,
damn my dick for title what that's 

1554
01:08:42,110 --> 01:08:44,090
doing.
That's just reinforcing stereotypes.

1555
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:47,620
I wasn't surprised.
I wasn't like,

1556
01:08:47,621 --> 01:08:48,900
oh my god.
It's trying to dig into it.

1557
01:08:48,910 --> 01:08:49,743
Yeah,
that's about right.

1558
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:53,200
I didn't miss a beat.
I was like,

1559
01:08:53,201 --> 01:08:53,800
oh,
that's cool.

1560
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:56,080
That's one of those stereotypes that 
people don't have a problem with.

1561
01:08:56,170 --> 01:08:57,550
If that was a white guy,
I'm like,

1562
01:08:57,610 --> 01:08:58,443
oh shit.
I would have jumped out of my fucking 

1563
01:08:59,711 --> 01:09:00,610
seat.
Like showtime.

1564
01:09:00,611 --> 01:09:02,340
Kick someone off the cage.
Yeah.

1565
01:09:02,650 --> 01:09:06,750
Polish guy,
fat white dick blythe,

1566
01:09:07,930 --> 01:09:12,930
snort and smoke dragon in this past big,
fat pale.

1567
01:09:17,470 --> 01:09:19,840
Makes me laugh right now.

1568
01:09:21,930 --> 01:09:22,763
Listen to the shogun.
I thought it was a breakdown and the 

1569
01:09:26,350 --> 01:09:28,180
talking about dick.
I'm talking about it.

1570
01:09:30,020 --> 01:09:31,700
You know,
that's how grace has got.

1571
01:09:33,230 --> 01:09:34,063
What's really funny.
It people get angry at this podcast to 

1572
01:09:35,901 --> 01:09:36,734
get angry,
get angry at some of the shit that we 

1573
01:09:38,451 --> 01:09:39,200
say like what?
What?

1574
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:41,030
What do you say when you're wIth your 
friends and you're drinking,

1575
01:09:41,270 --> 01:09:45,080
what do you say?
Ninety percent of the time people get so

1576
01:09:45,081 --> 01:09:45,914
angry 5,000
thing because he got so angry that I 

1577
01:09:48,381 --> 01:09:50,480
mentioned fried chicken.
Don't be mad at us.

1578
01:09:50,481 --> 01:09:52,370
Be mad.
He died fighting mma.

1579
01:09:52,420 --> 01:09:53,253
Here's the thing that's crazy that they 
were upset at me that I mentioned fried 

1580
01:09:56,301 --> 01:10:00,110
chicken because they said it was racist,
but they weren't upset that we're making

1581
01:10:00,111 --> 01:10:02,600
fun of a guy who is still in the 
hospital.

1582
01:10:02,750 --> 01:10:04,580
Like this is how crazy people's 
priorities are.

1583
01:10:04,910 --> 01:10:07,370
That first of all,
fried chicken is not racist.

1584
01:10:07,410 --> 01:10:09,560
It's.
It is a great food.

1585
01:10:09,561 --> 01:10:10,394
It's delicious.
It's fatty for you is not necessarily 

1586
01:10:12,111 --> 01:10:13,940
the best food for you,
but that's not racist.

1587
01:10:13,941 --> 01:10:14,774
What racist is is claiming or or 
pretending that one race is superior to 

1588
01:10:19,521 --> 01:10:20,354
another race.
Genetically that's not what fried 

1589
01:10:22,131 --> 01:10:23,570
chicken is.
Fried chicken.

1590
01:10:23,571 --> 01:10:24,404
It's just food and it was an example of 
a bad diet was overweight and cutting 

1591
01:10:27,531 --> 01:10:31,400
all this weight and look like shit.
How many people that are looking forward

1592
01:10:31,401 --> 01:10:34,150
to being angry so quick,
they need a reason.

1593
01:10:34,210 --> 01:10:35,043
Just looking forward to being upset that
like if somebody said if I was fat and 

1594
01:10:38,691 --> 01:10:39,870
someone's saying you,
you meet,

1595
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:41,540
eat motherfucker.
I'd be like,

1596
01:10:41,660 --> 01:10:42,710
yeah,
I like meat balls.

1597
01:10:42,980 --> 01:10:45,240
Like what is that so bad?
Because I'm italian girl.

1598
01:10:45,260 --> 01:10:46,093
You're genuinely not race.
I remember at one time I actually 

1599
01:10:48,741 --> 01:10:52,340
remember asking you this so interesting 
because you came from boston and kind of

1600
01:10:52,341 --> 01:10:53,174
working class kind of rough and I never 
heard and I'd known you for probably 

1601
01:10:56,811 --> 01:10:57,644
three years.
This is way back and I remember I said 

1602
01:10:59,601 --> 01:11:00,434
I'd never heard you say you say bad 
things about people you're fucking 

1603
01:11:05,110 --> 01:11:09,020
meaning he's a ball hate,
but I have never heard that.

1604
01:11:09,020 --> 01:11:11,620
I heard you say anything off color.
Not once.

1605
01:11:11,621 --> 01:11:14,130
I never heard you say a prejudice thing 
in any way and I remember

1606
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:14,963
saying to you,
I go,

1607
01:11:14,970 --> 01:11:15,803
you know you never,
I've never heard you make an off color 

1608
01:11:17,701 --> 01:11:19,740
joke about any race,
black people,

1609
01:11:19,750 --> 01:11:20,583
anything else,
and you said it never made any sense to 

1610
01:11:22,741 --> 01:11:23,520
me.
He said,

1611
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:24,331
You said,
you said,

1612
01:11:24,331 --> 01:11:27,350
I can show you a whole lot of really 
dumb white people.

1613
01:11:27,370 --> 01:11:29,760
I grew up.
It's all about socialization.

1614
01:11:29,761 --> 01:11:32,640
I don't know if you remember that.
It just made.

1615
01:11:32,650 --> 01:11:34,740
It just makes.
It never made sense.

1616
01:11:34,741 --> 01:11:37,320
It's cold.
She gets obvious though with data.

1617
01:11:37,610 --> 01:11:39,750
If data was white and you went,
ah,

1618
01:11:39,770 --> 01:11:42,270
fucking fried chicken,
pepsi drinking,

1619
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:43,870
no one's gonna say shit,
this is it.

1620
01:11:43,890 --> 01:11:47,440
This is how I feel about the data thing.
What I do feel bad about is that the guy

1621
01:11:47,441 --> 01:11:48,970
is still in the hospital.
That sucks.

1622
01:11:49,290 --> 01:11:50,820
Don't want anything bad to happen to 
them.

1623
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:52,020
I don't want anything bad to happen to 
him.

1624
01:11:52,021 --> 01:11:52,854
I'm glad he's okay and genuinely all we 
were doing was Joking around and having 

1625
01:11:56,100 --> 01:11:59,490
fun because that's what we do and if 
people construe that as racism,

1626
01:11:59,491 --> 01:12:02,550
because I mentioned chicken,
please substituted for pizza.

1627
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:05,550
That's what I meant.
My intent is what's important.

1628
01:12:05,551 --> 01:12:07,770
People like you were trying to be funny,
but same fried chicken.

1629
01:12:07,771 --> 01:12:08,880
Yes,
I was.

1630
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,470
Yes,
but I don't think that's racist.

1631
01:12:10,471 --> 01:12:11,580
I don't,
I don't,

1632
01:12:11,581 --> 01:12:13,170
I just,
it's food.

1633
01:12:13,570 --> 01:12:15,650
But it's funny that whole situation 
when,

1634
01:12:15,710 --> 01:12:16,140
when,
uh,

1635
01:12:16,140 --> 01:12:18,180
you know how when you do some crazy and 
people we'll put.

1636
01:12:18,181 --> 01:12:19,320
Did you die?
Would,

1637
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:20,630
yeah.
The hitch data dive.

1638
01:12:21,020 --> 01:12:23,820
Donna died.
Well he was his heart stopped.

1639
01:12:23,821 --> 01:12:24,654
Is that what happened?
Yeah.

1640
01:12:24,750 --> 01:12:27,510
Here's the thing,
man in everyone's saying,

1641
01:12:27,590 --> 01:12:28,423
you know,
that we shouldn't have been making fun 

1642
01:12:29,251 --> 01:12:30,084
of his weight and his family was saying 
that he was only two or three pounds 

1643
01:12:33,001 --> 01:12:33,834
over the week of the fight.
Well then there's even less excuses 

1644
01:12:37,470 --> 01:12:41,310
because if you're that much,
if you're only two or three pounds,

1645
01:12:41,311 --> 01:12:45,150
you're only cutting two or three pounds.
He's just unprepared.

1646
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:46,113
So whoever did it,
they were upset at us that we were 

1647
01:12:48,091 --> 01:12:50,790
making fun of his mma training or 
strength and conditioning coach.

1648
01:12:51,090 --> 01:12:54,780
But this is based on perFormance.
We have to.

1649
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:59,400
This is a coal main event and there's 
something bigger at stake.

1650
01:12:59,460 --> 01:13:03,390
Like all due respect to data.
This is my feelings on the data thing.

1651
01:13:03,630 --> 01:13:04,463
Here's the good thing,
here's a compliment that I will give 

1652
01:13:06,031 --> 01:13:06,900
him,
that god never quit.

1653
01:13:07,570 --> 01:13:10,410
His fucking heart had to give out and 
that guy never quit.

1654
01:13:10,610 --> 01:13:11,443
He didn't have any insurance,
but he still fought three fucking hard 

1655
01:13:14,281 --> 01:13:17,310
rounds and he had nothing in the tank,
but he never quit.

1656
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:19,500
Is a loT of opportunities for him to 
stay down.

1657
01:13:19,650 --> 01:13:21,570
He never quit.
He showed a lot of heart.

1658
01:13:22,020 --> 01:13:24,900
He wasn't like the way you think joe,
but he wasn't trained properly.

1659
01:13:24,990 --> 01:13:27,320
He wasn't prepared properly.
Don't have the skillset.

1660
01:13:27,350 --> 01:13:28,530
It wasn't ready.
No,

1661
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:31,020
that's right.
And if you walk into that magnitude of a

1662
01:13:31,021 --> 01:13:34,360
fight and he have titties hanging,
I'm going to make a comment.

1663
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:38,150
I make a comment like that about Roy Roy
Nelson to all the time you get to do.

1664
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:38,993
What about Roy Nelson all the time.
And I've always said that roy nelson's 

1665
01:13:40,981 --> 01:13:43,910
gut is like he's wearing like 30 
sweaters and that it's just,

1666
01:13:43,950 --> 01:13:45,360
it's all like you're hitting 
cheeseburgers.

1667
01:13:45,361 --> 01:13:47,550
You not even hitting him.
You're hitting all this shit.

1668
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:49,290
There's,
but you know,

1669
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:51,120
that's okay because I'm white and roy's 
white,

1670
01:13:51,121 --> 01:13:51,954
but the those fights are not good for 
the support and this is why they're not 

1671
01:13:56,701 --> 01:14:00,030
good for the sport.
You're takIng two guys that look bad.

1672
01:14:00,340 --> 01:14:04,290
Their endurance and conditioning was 
terrible that this.

1673
01:14:04,770 --> 01:14:05,603
The scrambles were awful.
Like when one time kimbo took him down 

1674
01:14:08,971 --> 01:14:11,710
And just got on top of them and they're 
just laying on the amateur.

1675
01:14:12,270 --> 01:14:16,750
It's just so.
It's so bush leagues that there's no way

1676
01:14:16,810 --> 01:14:17,643
that anybody who watches that,
like say if you're a boxing fan and you 

1677
01:14:20,171 --> 01:14:21,004
watch like,
do you see karen's crawford the other 

1678
01:14:21,941 --> 01:14:22,774
night?
That mother,

1679
01:14:25,110 --> 01:14:26,820
good luck beating that dude.
Damn,

1680
01:14:26,821 --> 01:14:29,400
he's good.
He murked that he's so good and you know

1681
01:14:29,401 --> 01:14:30,900
what man has switched.
He,

1682
01:14:30,901 --> 01:14:33,800
he'll fight You better.
Which southpaw.

1683
01:14:33,830 --> 01:14:37,760
I mean it's like marvin hagler almost 
like that level of switch.

1684
01:14:37,820 --> 01:14:41,450
HiS ability to fight from either stands 
just needs a big title like a mainstream

1685
01:14:41,460 --> 01:14:42,293
fight back.
If you're a boxing fan and you watch 

1686
01:14:44,970 --> 01:14:46,860
that fight and then you say,
well,

1687
01:14:46,861 --> 01:14:48,840
let me check out what this mma shit's 
all about,

1688
01:14:48,990 --> 01:14:51,640
and then you go and watch the kimbo dada
fight.

1689
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:52,513
Just throw up,
throw up like this is an embarrassment 

1690
01:14:54,931 --> 01:14:59,250
to the sport and this is not a mark 
against them as human beings.

1691
01:14:59,460 --> 01:15:02,220
This is just where they are now.
Everybody starts off.

1692
01:15:02,250 --> 01:15:04,920
look,
if the first day you enter into any sort

1693
01:15:04,921 --> 01:15:08,820
of an mma gym or dojo,
whatever you all,

1694
01:15:08,850 --> 01:15:11,040
we all start out as someone who doesn't 
know anything.

1695
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:11,993
We all start out with whatever strength 
and conditioning you've gotten coming 

1696
01:15:15,961 --> 01:15:16,351
in.
You know,

1697
01:15:16,351 --> 01:15:17,670
if you're a gymnast or whatever,
you know,

1698
01:15:17,671 --> 01:15:18,504
you bring whatever base you have,
but we all start out not knowing 

1699
01:15:20,731 --> 01:15:23,580
anything.
Once you get to a co main event,

1700
01:15:23,700 --> 01:15:26,140
I demand that you are better than that 
tip.

1701
01:15:26,310 --> 01:15:28,080
It's that simple.
I demand it.

1702
01:15:28,110 --> 01:15:29,430
I agree amanda,
especially,

1703
01:15:29,460 --> 01:15:31,950
especially 2016.
fuck you man.

1704
01:15:31,951 --> 01:15:34,530
This is where I respect the shit out of 
the ufc and dana,

1705
01:15:34,740 --> 01:15:35,573
when kimbo wanted to fight in the ufc,
they were like fight in the ultimate 

1706
01:15:37,891 --> 01:15:39,280
fighter.
Like you want it,

1707
01:15:39,281 --> 01:15:40,114
you want to figHt in the ufc.
I know you're making a lot of money and 

1708
01:15:41,551 --> 01:15:42,330
elite,
sexy,

1709
01:15:42,330 --> 01:15:44,760
and you know everybody's making it out 
that you're the biggest thing.

1710
01:15:44,761 --> 01:15:46,430
But look,
When seth petros,

1711
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:47,460
ellie,
fuck kimbo.

1712
01:15:47,660 --> 01:15:51,930
I know there's a video of me saying it.
I was watching it from the fucking green

1713
01:15:51,931 --> 01:15:52,764
room of the atlanta atlanta punchline 
and I'd just gotten off stage and ken 

1714
01:15:56,161 --> 01:16:00,120
shamrock got injured when he was 
supposed to be fighting kimbo and I went

1715
01:16:00,121 --> 01:16:02,180
backstage and I saw seth petrosian.

1716
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:03,510
I go,
what the fuck is going on?

1717
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:05,150
And they said,
ken shamrock got injured.

1718
01:16:05,151 --> 01:16:06,060
I went,
no way.

1719
01:16:06,250 --> 01:16:07,083
And he said,
seth petrocelli stepped in the day of 

1720
01:16:09,630 --> 01:16:10,860
the fight and took the fight.
I'm like,

1721
01:16:10,890 --> 01:16:13,590
oh no.
Kimball's going against the fucked up.

1722
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:16,590
That's the first thing.
I never make calls like that,

1723
01:16:16,770 --> 01:16:18,330
but I said it.
It's on video.

1724
01:16:18,331 --> 01:16:21,150
You could watch the video of me saying 
he's going to get fucked up.

1725
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:24,120
And then he gets knocked out while we're
watching the video.

1726
01:16:24,121 --> 01:16:25,380
Like six seconds later.
I'm like,

1727
01:16:25,530 --> 01:16:26,363
I told you because there's a difference 
between fighting guys who were awkward 

1728
01:16:32,821 --> 01:16:33,654
and clumsy and you're a big tough guy 
with good boxing and backyard and 

1729
01:16:36,550 --> 01:16:38,620
fighting a mother fucker like seth 
petrosa.

1730
01:16:38,690 --> 01:16:39,750
Let me ask you this,
joe.

1731
01:16:39,990 --> 01:16:40,823
How do you justify cm punk?
I Don't ask them to go on the ultimate 

1732
01:16:45,121 --> 01:16:46,260
fighter.
From what I've heard,

1733
01:16:46,261 --> 01:16:48,090
they asked him and he was like,
first of all,

1734
01:16:48,091 --> 01:16:50,820
sweat that glorious bam suddenly get 
that.

1735
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:51,713
Why don't you bring that shit?

1736
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:57,920
There's a last minute replacement sap,
which is always going to fuck them up if

1737
01:16:58,610 --> 01:17:03,610
I'm wrong and never see this,
so this is.

1738
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:08,160
ThIs is the fight live.
Here we go,

1739
01:17:14,980 --> 01:17:17,060
oh my god,
why is it

1740
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:34,920
right now?
But I had to be that high to give that,

1741
01:17:34,980 --> 01:17:36,460
that,
that breakdown,

1742
01:17:36,730 --> 01:17:38,230
breakdown,
breakdown,

1743
01:17:39,210 --> 01:17:40,450
get heightened.
That beer,

1744
01:17:42,410 --> 01:17:47,130
if you in my discipline kimbo this 
through this is this is reality.

1745
01:17:47,131 --> 01:17:49,950
There's levels to fighting and this is 
what I mean.

1746
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:51,760
I'm an.
I'm an mma analyst,

1747
01:17:51,770 --> 01:17:52,603
is what do I do as a profession?
I've been doing it for a long fucking 

1748
01:17:55,801 --> 01:17:57,360
time.
I've called thousands of fights.

1749
01:17:57,720 --> 01:18:01,500
That fight should not be a co main event
fight.

1750
01:18:01,620 --> 01:18:04,050
I'm not saying those guys shouldn't be 
allowed to compete against each other.

1751
01:18:04,051 --> 01:18:06,180
They certainly should,
but they're not.

1752
01:18:06,210 --> 01:18:07,043
I mean I understand they want to get 
paid and I get all that and I know the 

1753
01:18:09,811 --> 01:18:10,644
kimball has some serious knee problems,
so I kimbo when he was on the ultimate 

1754
01:18:12,901 --> 01:18:15,540
fighter,
they diagnosed him with bone on bone.

1755
01:18:15,790 --> 01:18:18,350
Cartilage.
Cartilage is just devastated.

1756
01:18:18,370 --> 01:18:19,203
his knees,
his needs are fucked from years of 

1757
01:18:20,821 --> 01:18:24,210
football and you know,
all the mma training that he has done.

1758
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:25,193
So I'm not hurt.
I'm not hating on those guys to get 

1759
01:18:26,611 --> 01:18:27,444
paid,
but what I am saying is please bella 

1760
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:30,630
tour.
Cut the shit.

1761
01:18:31,130 --> 01:18:34,560
You can't do that.
The circus chance.

1762
01:18:34,561 --> 01:18:35,394
A real chance.
Beltour has a real chance of being a 

1763
01:18:37,681 --> 01:18:41,340
gigantic organization.
They just signed benson henderson.

1764
01:18:41,460 --> 01:18:44,640
They got josh thompson.
They might get your boy mitrione.

1765
01:18:44,790 --> 01:18:46,710
They might get a bunch oF other really 
good fighters.

1766
01:18:46,711 --> 01:18:49,020
They got vendor still but just fucking 
signed with them.

1767
01:18:49,230 --> 01:18:50,063
They have a real chance at being right 
up there with the ufc there a fucking 

1768
01:18:54,031 --> 01:18:54,864
viacom entity.
They have a tremendous amount of money 

1769
01:18:56,821 --> 01:18:58,260
behind them.
They're oN television.

1770
01:18:58,261 --> 01:19:00,180
They're on spike tv to it.
Right.

1771
01:19:00,181 --> 01:19:01,014
You know what's tough though,
if we're going to look at the rating 

1772
01:19:03,811 --> 01:19:05,500
son,
over 2 million views.

1773
01:19:05,510 --> 01:19:08,760
Toys.is
titties or to the side and kimbro's gas.

1774
01:19:08,790 --> 01:19:09,840
It's hoists.
Gracie though.

1775
01:19:09,870 --> 01:19:10,703
That's what quite see.

1776
01:19:10,830 --> 01:19:13,830
I disagree.
I think it's kimbo was a huge draw.

1777
01:19:13,860 --> 01:19:15,810
What is your.
What if they didn't get toys?

1778
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:16,673
You might be right.
What if they have the numbers in the 

1779
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:19,740
fight pass for ufc pushing.
Fight pass.

1780
01:19:19,950 --> 01:19:21,540
Put the freak shows on fight pass.
Yeah,

1781
01:19:21,541 --> 01:19:24,870
But why put kim on bypass when you get 2
million views on spike tv?

1782
01:19:26,180 --> 01:19:27,013
Maybe it'll drive viewers to your.
Your content in sucH bad shape that the 

1783
01:19:31,531 --> 01:19:36,531
fight itself almost kills him and not 
damage.

1784
01:19:37,050 --> 01:19:39,630
Just just competing.
Almost kills them.

1785
01:19:39,810 --> 01:19:41,520
Because if you look at the damage that 
he took,

1786
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,590
nothing.
Almost nothing.

1787
01:19:43,710 --> 01:19:44,543
Look,
the combination that dropped him like 

1788
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:49,590
the people have played it back and forth
like ghost punches his body failed.

1789
01:19:49,591 --> 01:19:52,260
If you ate the same shots [inaudible] 
did against anderson silva.

1790
01:19:52,261 --> 01:19:53,230
Oh mY god,
you're dead.

1791
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:56,400
Oh my god.
That fucking flying knee,

1792
01:19:56,490 --> 01:19:58,590
that fucking flying,
but here again,

1793
01:19:58,710 --> 01:20:02,550
if anybody felt that I said something 
racist.

1794
01:20:02,970 --> 01:20:05,100
I'm sorry that you felt that way.
I really am.

1795
01:20:05,370 --> 01:20:09,720
I'm not sorry that I said chicken 
because I think this is ridiculous.

1796
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:10,733
It's a ridiculous argument and I think 
in this day and age there's nothing 

1797
01:20:13,951 --> 01:20:16,500
wrong with chicken.
Is nothing wrong with eating chicken.

1798
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:19,260
It tastes great.
It's not racism.

1799
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:20,333
Racism is trying to imply that one race 
is inferior and that is just not 

1800
01:20:25,860 --> 01:20:28,110
replaced chicken with any fast food,
fatty food.

1801
01:20:28,111 --> 01:20:30,030
When you're out of shape.
This is an example,

1802
01:20:30,060 --> 01:20:31,860
but there's a thing that people do,
man,

1803
01:20:31,861 --> 01:20:32,694
what they just looked to be offended or 
they decide that this is somethiNg they 

1804
01:20:35,311 --> 01:20:38,250
should be offended at.
Not looking at intent.

1805
01:20:38,490 --> 01:20:39,323
My intent was I'm talking about a guy 
who obviously he didn't eat kale salads 

1806
01:20:42,601 --> 01:20:46,700
and Fucking lean fish to Get to that 
weight man.

1807
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:49,750
Yeah.
That's another point is that when you.

1808
01:20:49,780 --> 01:20:54,460
When you say it feels like we live in a 
time when,

1809
01:20:54,730 --> 01:20:55,563
when you.
When you are fighting for one group of 

1810
01:20:57,551 --> 01:20:58,384
people,
like say people who have been oppressed 

1811
01:21:00,191 --> 01:21:04,000
in the past,
instead of kind of having an intelligent

1812
01:21:04,001 --> 01:21:06,700
debate and pointing your guns where they
should be pointed out,

1813
01:21:06,701 --> 01:21:08,560
which is usually a complex set of 
issues.

1814
01:21:09,010 --> 01:21:09,843
What we're doing.
I feel like as we're demonizing one 

1815
01:21:11,591 --> 01:21:15,040
group to bolster another group that we 
call not really.

1816
01:21:15,041 --> 01:21:15,874
They're not demonizing white people.
I don't think anybody's demonizing you 

1817
01:21:19,651 --> 01:21:21,120
think people do.
I think.

1818
01:21:21,130 --> 01:21:22,570
I think a lot of times,
you know,

1819
01:21:22,571 --> 01:21:23,560
if you look at,
for example,

1820
01:21:23,610 --> 01:21:24,443
I,
I went to u penn and I spoke to these 

1821
01:21:27,731 --> 01:21:30,180
kids in their theater department because
that's somebody asked.

1822
01:21:30,220 --> 01:21:32,350
Somebody asked me somebody,
somebody to do it.

1823
01:21:32,440 --> 01:21:33,273
It was fine.
Now they wanted me to do it about the 

1824
01:21:34,451 --> 01:21:35,830
goldbergs and stuff and I was there.

1825
01:21:35,830 --> 01:21:38,710
I was there and I and I went and I asked
the kids.

1826
01:21:38,711 --> 01:21:42,640
I said,
how many of you feel like your comedy is

1827
01:21:42,820 --> 01:21:43,653
something you have to be careful of 
because you might offend somebody in 

1828
01:21:46,841 --> 01:21:51,400
your class or your school and half the 
class raised their hands,

1829
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:53,290
and by the way,
most of those kids,

1830
01:21:53,291 --> 01:21:54,880
because I did it,
I looked at it,

1831
01:21:54,881 --> 01:21:58,090
were mostly white and I thought that's a
shame.

1832
01:21:58,270 --> 01:22:03,270
That's such a bummer that your 
expression and especially your comedy,

1833
01:22:03,730 --> 01:22:06,130
is being cowed by,
you know,

1834
01:22:06,131 --> 01:22:08,800
the fact that you're,
you're trying to be fair minded.

1835
01:22:08,830 --> 01:22:10,180
You know,
most of those kids,

1836
01:22:10,181 --> 01:22:11,830
I don't think we're racist or anything 
else,

1837
01:22:11,831 --> 01:22:14,970
but when you're actually right,
but,

1838
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:17,980
but we see this in our,
in our institutions of learning,

1839
01:22:17,981 --> 01:22:18,814
especially at a higher institution of 
learning where you're just not able to 

1840
01:22:21,191 --> 01:22:24,460
really an honestly express yourself and 
god forbid,

1841
01:22:24,461 --> 01:22:27,070
it's funny,
god forbid it's a joke.

1842
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:27,970
Uh,
you know,

1843
01:22:27,970 --> 01:22:29,860
if you're not,
if you're not towing the line,

1844
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:34,000
then you will be censored.
Yeah.

1845
01:22:34,001 --> 01:22:34,834
I think it's a matter of demonizing 
white people because it not demonizing 

1846
01:22:37,740 --> 01:22:40,610
white people without doing that because 
demonizing white people as demonizing,

1847
01:22:41,910 --> 01:22:43,660
looking for anything to be offended.
Right?

1848
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:45,820
Even things that are not offensive,
right?

1849
01:22:46,300 --> 01:22:49,480
There's a lot of people took more like 
chris rock took a lot of heat from other

1850
01:22:49,481 --> 01:22:50,314
black people.
I mean,

1851
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:52,720
oh yeah,
white people and asian people.

1852
01:22:52,750 --> 01:22:53,583
So those were all very sensitive at a 
time when we're making big strides as 

1853
01:22:56,651 --> 01:22:58,770
well.
One hundred percent and I think part

1854
01:22:58,770 --> 01:23:00,090
of that,
the,

1855
01:23:00,330 --> 01:23:01,163
the,
the over sensitivity is because we 

1856
01:23:02,971 --> 01:23:05,220
sensed that there is a lot of positive

1857
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:06,843
right?
And then people want to keep that going 

1858
01:23:08,021 --> 01:23:11,440
and they want to stop any racism,
any racism that does come up,

1859
01:23:11,620 --> 01:23:12,453
they want to nip that shit in the bud 
and let people know that it's not 

1860
01:23:14,620 --> 01:23:16,810
tolerated anymore,
which is understandable,

1861
01:23:16,811 --> 01:23:17,644
but we have to know when it's.
When racism is real and when iT's not 

1862
01:23:20,321 --> 01:23:21,154
real.
And there's also a lot of bandwagon 

1863
01:23:22,571 --> 01:23:23,404
bullshit jumping on where people just 
decide if this is something they should 

1864
01:23:26,291 --> 01:23:29,710
be offended by,
where I'll sit down with you,

1865
01:23:29,711 --> 01:23:30,544
motherfucker.
You try to argue with me that that's 

1866
01:23:31,571 --> 01:23:33,720
racist.
There's no argument.

1867
01:23:33,740 --> 01:23:37,290
Doesn't make any sense.
Mom who they just wanted to jump on it.

1868
01:23:37,430 --> 01:23:38,263
It's a stupid argument.
It's like watermelon watermelon's a 

1869
01:23:40,361 --> 01:23:41,560
stupid argument.
Watermelons,

1870
01:23:41,590 --> 01:23:44,200
god damn delicious fruit.
You tell me the watermelon is racist.

1871
01:23:44,220 --> 01:23:47,170
You're an idiot if you're telling me 
grape juice.

1872
01:23:47,171 --> 01:23:48,010
Watermelon,
chickens,

1873
01:23:48,011 --> 01:23:48,844
racist.
They're.

1874
01:23:48,850 --> 01:23:51,630
They're reacting though too to in the 
past.

1875
01:23:51,631 --> 01:23:54,250
They're using what was used in the past 
to create good,

1876
01:23:55,100 --> 01:23:59,590
but fried chicken has always been a 
delicious food.

1877
01:23:59,860 --> 01:24:00,693
There's no time.
It's not like something that like poor 

1878
01:24:02,741 --> 01:24:05,350
people could only afford and matter of 
fact,

1879
01:24:05,530 --> 01:24:07,300
when who was it?
Who was running for president?

1880
01:24:07,480 --> 01:24:11,590
I think it was roosevelt when he was in 
his campaign,

1881
01:24:11,591 --> 01:24:12,424
one a part of his campaign was a chicken
in every pot and the reason why is 

1882
01:24:15,950 --> 01:24:16,783
because chicken was expensive back then,
so he was saying that he was going to 

1883
01:24:19,831 --> 01:24:20,664
offer prosperity to the american people 
and that every family would have a 

1884
01:24:23,561 --> 01:24:24,640
chicken.
I'm offended.

1885
01:24:24,641 --> 01:24:27,720
Fried chicken's racist now just fended.
It's just,

1886
01:24:27,730 --> 01:24:28,563
it's not racist.
It's racial in that it's always been in 

1887
01:24:31,481 --> 01:24:32,314
some way connected with black people,
but it's also not something only black 

1888
01:24:36,701 --> 01:24:37,534
people eat.
It's not like curry when magic johnson 

1889
01:24:39,281 --> 01:24:40,114
is like,
that's like a serious ethnic for say 

1890
01:24:41,860 --> 01:24:44,980
someone smells like curry,
like that's more racial.

1891
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:48,000
If you're talking about a racist person,
an indian person,

1892
01:24:48,001 --> 01:24:50,500
when magic johnson owned all his 
starbucks,

1893
01:24:50,830 --> 01:24:51,663
he opened starbucks in black 
neighborhoods and one of the first 

1894
01:24:53,981 --> 01:24:54,814
things he said is,
you guys are selling food that black 

1895
01:24:57,460 --> 01:25:01,510
people that I grew up with are not going
to eat and here are the foods you should

1896
01:25:01,511 --> 01:25:02,344
sell at my starbucks and he made a lot 
of money by changing at what what they 

1897
01:25:08,561 --> 01:25:10,660
were willing to offer.
What dId they change it to?

1898
01:25:10,690 --> 01:25:12,400
What was the new,
believe it or not,

1899
01:25:12,430 --> 01:25:13,263
I think one of the things,
this is back when I read about it for a 

1900
01:25:15,761 --> 01:25:16,780
long time,
10 years ago,

1901
01:25:16,781 --> 01:25:17,614
more than that,
they were offering in the starbucks in 

1902
01:25:20,711 --> 01:25:21,544
harlem and places like that.
They were offering things like sweet 

1903
01:25:23,741 --> 01:25:27,040
potato pie because chicken not I don't 
know,

1904
01:25:27,250 --> 01:25:30,640
but I noticed when I know pies,
magic mop god damn delicious.

1905
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:33,190
Starbucks.
I'd never seen it.

1906
01:25:33,191 --> 01:25:34,740
That starbucks jet.
Imagine john said,

1907
01:25:34,760 --> 01:25:35,593
you got to this.
The food that you have in these is not 

1908
01:25:38,231 --> 01:25:39,220
gonna fly.
Hold up.

1909
01:25:39,221 --> 01:25:41,050
Magic johnson.
Potato pie.

1910
01:25:41,620 --> 01:25:45,770
We don't make scones.
Scones,

1911
01:25:46,690 --> 01:25:48,010
racist.
That's cultural.

1912
01:25:48,070 --> 01:25:49,990
That's a cultural thing.
We know.

1913
01:25:49,991 --> 01:25:51,880
It's hilarious.
Another thing that people were trying to

1914
01:25:51,881 --> 01:25:54,440
get upset at me was orange soda.
Guess what?

1915
01:25:55,610 --> 01:25:59,470
Soda is not connected to black people.
It is just not.

1916
01:25:59,650 --> 01:26:04,070
It's not like saying that orange sodas 
racist so that like the cover of yahoo,

1917
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:06,710
they cut out cheeseburgers and they 
wrote.

1918
01:26:06,711 --> 01:26:10,400
Joe rogan says that data ate fried 
chicken and orange soda,

1919
01:26:10,700 --> 01:26:14,570
like they didn't even cheeseburger 
because I was trying to throw in a bunch

1920
01:26:14,571 --> 01:26:17,540
of different things,
but orange soda is not racist at all.

1921
01:26:17,541 --> 01:26:19,790
It's a syrupy,
super sweet,

1922
01:26:19,791 --> 01:26:23,270
fatty drank soda.
It's very tasty.

1923
01:26:24,050 --> 01:26:27,830
It's thicker than a snickers man.
I love orange soda.

1924
01:26:28,340 --> 01:26:30,410
Sugar.
Addicted to those.

1925
01:26:30,411 --> 01:26:33,720
God damn delicious.
I'm a mangoes with chili.

1926
01:26:33,750 --> 01:26:35,470
Fuck me.
Fuck you.

1927
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:37,730
And I just go in there.
They put a name on them,

1928
01:26:37,940 --> 01:26:39,080
bags of them.
I can't eat them.

1929
01:26:39,820 --> 01:26:42,070
This diet that I'm on,
you know what I should try.

1930
01:26:42,420 --> 01:26:44,900
I got a bunch of different companies 
that I have back.

1931
01:26:44,901 --> 01:26:46,610
There you go.
Grab one.

1932
01:26:47,050 --> 01:26:50,940
Here's there's bags of them back there.
The one extra bagman.

1933
01:26:50,990 --> 01:26:53,840
They're the best ones.
The best ones that I've tried so far.

1934
01:26:53,850 --> 01:26:54,760
Trader joe's,
uh,

1935
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:55,633
to the right,
the trader joe's ones are god damn 

1936
01:26:57,711 --> 01:26:59,010
delicious.
Sugar man.

1937
01:26:59,011 --> 01:27:01,250
Me and sugar.
I don't everybody in sugar.

1938
01:27:01,850 --> 01:27:03,830
People were mad at me for talking too 
much about sugar.

1939
01:27:03,831 --> 01:27:04,664
So I'm gonna shut the fuck up because 
people aren't doing anything and do 

1940
01:27:07,110 --> 01:27:10,040
anything.
Can't do anything.

1941
01:27:12,140 --> 01:27:12,973
Well,
you know what the deals were dealing 

1942
01:27:14,091 --> 01:27:16,010
with volume.
The numbers.

1943
01:27:16,011 --> 01:27:19,220
I mean we've got like 23 million 
downloads this month.

1944
01:27:19,780 --> 01:27:20,613
The numbers are insane.
Whenever you stand for something or 

1945
01:27:22,341 --> 01:27:24,650
whenever you have an opinion,
chili,

1946
01:27:24,651 --> 01:27:25,850
mango.
Me too.

1947
01:27:26,030 --> 01:27:27,910
Whenever you stand for something or you 
have an opinion,

1948
01:27:28,100 --> 01:27:30,050
people aren't going to agree with 
everything man.

1949
01:27:30,150 --> 01:27:32,060
But,
but if people are disagreeing with you,

1950
01:27:32,090 --> 01:27:35,030
you're a schmuck mcmahon.
Well you're not.

1951
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:37,030
You're not expressing yourself.
honestly.

1952
01:27:37,031 --> 01:27:39,170
You're not being original.
You're trying to please the crowd.

1953
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:40,033
everybody has different points of view 
and a few have nothing wrong with that 

1954
01:27:41,901 --> 01:27:43,040
though.
You're not a hater.

1955
01:27:43,190 --> 01:27:46,520
You sometimes look at that.
He gave it to you all.

1956
01:27:46,550 --> 01:27:47,540
Thanks bro.
He's eating.

1957
01:27:47,570 --> 01:27:50,060
He's eating a fucking bar.
He's eating something super healthy,

1958
01:27:50,061 --> 01:27:50,894
low sugar,
and he handed that bag over the years 

1959
01:27:52,340 --> 01:27:55,130
because I'm mexican doesn't mean that 
like fruit fucking salt on it.

1960
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:58,340
I never been able to figure it out.
Well,

1961
01:27:58,341 --> 01:28:00,260
it's the.
It's the chili powder man.

1962
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:03,530
That's a delicious combination.
I had a dream last night.

1963
01:28:03,770 --> 01:28:04,603
I had a dream last night that I was 
eating bread and that sand that someone 

1964
01:28:08,031 --> 01:28:09,620
called me out on it and someone was 
like,

1965
01:28:09,621 --> 01:28:10,550
dude,
you're eating bread.

1966
01:28:10,551 --> 01:28:11,031
I was like,
oh,

1967
01:28:11,031 --> 01:28:13,660
no doubt center got too high and I ate 
the bread.

1968
01:28:13,680 --> 01:28:17,500
I'm not crazy.
What kind of a fucked up dream is that?

1969
01:28:17,570 --> 01:28:20,170
I'm eating bread.
THat was a real dream that I had.

1970
01:28:20,171 --> 01:28:22,700
I can't believe you're gonna run with 
this diet for more than 60 days.

1971
01:28:23,180 --> 01:28:25,100
I'm definitely going to run with for 
more than 60 days.

1972
01:28:25,101 --> 01:28:27,050
I felt great.
I'm down.

1973
01:28:27,051 --> 01:28:30,140
I don't know how much I'm down for this 
morning.

1974
01:28:30,740 --> 01:28:32,840
And you start actually won 93 point 
eight.

1975
01:28:32,841 --> 01:28:34,010
You started at two.
Oh,

1976
01:28:34,011 --> 01:28:36,650
two,
two or three bad.

1977
01:28:37,070 --> 01:28:40,640
Somewhere around like nine pounds down.
It's pretty cool.

1978
01:28:40,641 --> 01:28:42,920
And you're eating.
I'm eating like a pig.

1979
01:28:42,921 --> 01:28:46,910
My thing is when I'm at home,
but when remember whenever count I go on

1980
01:28:46,911 --> 01:28:49,070
the road or anything like that,
my diet goes to shit.

1981
01:28:49,580 --> 01:28:51,740
If I Had to walk around with a 10 pound 
jacket on,

1982
01:28:51,820 --> 01:28:53,450
I would be an uncomfortable.
I'd be like,

1983
01:28:53,690 --> 01:28:54,523
get this fucking stupid jacket off.
I think that's how you have to look at 

1984
01:28:57,591 --> 01:28:59,450
your body.
if you're one of those people that goes,

1985
01:28:59,480 --> 01:29:00,313
oh,
I could lose 20 pounds of who gives a 

1986
01:29:00,930 --> 01:29:01,950
shit.
If you

1987
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:04,350
take tHat 20 pounds and put a 20 pound 
jacket on,

1988
01:29:04,351 --> 01:29:05,184
how would you feel you?
You're just accustomed to feeling like 

1989
01:29:07,381 --> 01:29:08,214
shit.
So that feeling like shit becomes your 

1990
01:29:09,541 --> 01:29:12,990
new normal.
I'll eat six cadbury eggs.

1991
01:29:16,100 --> 01:29:21,100
I fucking was cadbury eggs,
but if you want to kidnap them,

1992
01:29:22,350 --> 01:29:23,183
put some cadbury eggs in a van and put 
them in the back of the van and then 

1993
01:29:25,831 --> 01:29:28,140
he'll just can't help it gladly with 
that.

1994
01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:31,710
Like one of those fucking is trapped.
Coyotes.

1995
01:29:33,350 --> 01:29:36,780
Slam the door shut behind them.
Got you.

1996
01:29:37,640 --> 01:29:38,473
Got you.

1997
01:29:39,820 --> 01:29:40,653
We're in a meeting.
We're in a meeting couple days ago with 

1998
01:29:42,311 --> 01:29:45,660
fox all suits and so and had a bag of 
red vines like,

1999
01:29:45,661 --> 01:29:46,510
shop.
You want one?

2000
01:29:46,511 --> 01:29:47,590
They threw me the bag.
I was like,

2001
01:29:47,820 --> 01:29:49,760
ah,
fuck goes.

2002
01:29:49,900 --> 01:29:51,910
Holy shit.
He ate all of them in front of.

2003
01:29:51,911 --> 01:29:53,060
Everyone's like,
well,

2004
01:29:53,080 --> 01:29:53,913
I turn my head to look out the window 
and then I turned back and they were 

2005
01:29:55,391 --> 01:29:56,021
gone.
I was like,

2006
01:29:56,021 --> 01:29:57,280
what'd you do?
Swallow them all.

2007
01:29:57,730 --> 01:30:01,600
Can you tell her it is a drug?
it really is.

2008
01:30:01,601 --> 01:30:04,030
It doesn't seem like a drug because it 
doesn't get you high,

2009
01:30:04,300 --> 01:30:07,780
but if there's a physical reaction that 
your body has to sugar.

2010
01:30:07,781 --> 01:30:08,614
where when I would eat out,
eat a full meal and then after the meal 

2011
01:30:11,891 --> 01:30:12,724
I would still be hungry for something 
and what I was craving was either carbs 

2012
01:30:17,201 --> 01:30:18,034
or I was craving cookies.
Like I see like a bag of cookies and 

2013
01:30:21,010 --> 01:30:23,650
cookies,
sweet tooth sugar.

2014
01:30:23,900 --> 01:30:28,000
Meanwhile I'm stuffed.
Stuffed like I ate a giant meal.

2015
01:30:28,140 --> 01:30:29,050
Yeah.
I don't have a sweet tooth,

2016
01:30:29,110 --> 01:30:31,210
sweet teeth.
It's just like that all the time.

2017
01:30:31,211 --> 01:30:32,044
You know what I'm saying?
Because there's never ever not want 

2018
01:30:33,881 --> 01:30:34,541
shogun.
Yeah.

2019
01:30:34,541 --> 01:30:37,450
But if you stopped eating it,
if you like took time off,

2020
01:30:37,630 --> 01:30:38,463
I guarantee you your gut bacteria would 
change and that that craving would go 

2021
01:30:41,831 --> 01:30:43,600
away.
Like I could look,

2022
01:30:43,750 --> 01:30:45,310
I could eat that.
No one's stopping me.

2023
01:30:45,390 --> 01:30:48,070
I don't have a like a law.
It's not like I'm on probation.

2024
01:30:48,071 --> 01:30:50,470
I can't have fucking sugar.
I don't want it.

2025
01:30:50,820 --> 01:30:53,680
What am I not?
Is raw honey different in your body?

2026
01:30:53,710 --> 01:30:54,620
No,
not really.

2027
01:30:54,860 --> 01:30:55,870
I mean sugar,
sugar.

2028
01:30:55,871 --> 01:30:57,530
But it's not terrible for you.
Look,

2029
01:30:57,550 --> 01:30:59,710
it's not terrible for you if you don't 
get too much of it.

2030
01:30:59,890 --> 01:31:03,280
The problem is you're only really 
supposed to have about 25 grams of sugar

2031
01:31:03,281 --> 01:31:05,190
a day if you live a healthy diet.

2032
01:31:05,830 --> 01:31:08,390
That's why I'm saying I'm saying good 
luck in 25 grand.

2033
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:09,800
So I do I think,
right?

2034
01:31:09,850 --> 01:31:11,290
Or do I do count?
You count.

2035
01:31:11,490 --> 01:31:13,740
But I think bread breaks down as glucose
quit.

2036
01:31:13,750 --> 01:31:15,230
No.
Bread is sugar.

2037
01:31:15,670 --> 01:31:18,280
Sugar and in pasta,
pasta,

2038
01:31:18,281 --> 01:31:19,740
sugar.
You know,

2039
01:31:19,780 --> 01:31:21,870
this diet,
this prime mark sisson,

2040
01:31:21,880 --> 01:31:26,560
the primal blueprint diet is no grains 
and I've never done that before.

2041
01:31:26,561 --> 01:31:27,394
I've done gluten free before.
What had like rice noodles and stuff 

2042
01:31:29,771 --> 01:31:30,604
like that.
This is the first time I've ever had no 

2043
01:31:32,831 --> 01:31:34,930
grains at all and I just did it for a 
goof,

2044
01:31:35,200 --> 01:31:37,190
you know,
I'm not doing it to prepare for it,

2045
01:31:37,191 --> 01:31:41,850
but listen to this guy,
mark sisson who was a very smart guy and

2046
01:31:41,851 --> 01:31:43,780
very interesting guy to talk to.
He's not,

2047
01:31:44,140 --> 01:31:44,973
you know,
he's not a bullshit artist and I'm 

2048
01:31:45,581 --> 01:31:46,414
listening to what he had to say about 
inflammation and all the issues that he 

2049
01:31:49,121 --> 01:31:49,900
had dealt with.

2050
01:31:49,900 --> 01:31:50,733
Like acid reflux or what was it?
I listened to the show ids and also 

2051
01:31:56,981 --> 01:31:59,320
joint pain arthritis.
I'm you.

2052
01:31:59,321 --> 01:32:00,154
That is the interesting thing.
I think I talked about this before the 

2053
01:32:01,751 --> 01:32:02,584
podcast,
but when I get out of bed I don't have 

2054
01:32:04,001 --> 01:32:06,790
any aches and pains anymore.
I would get out a bit that'd be like,

2055
01:32:06,850 --> 01:32:07,683
oh my fucking back and I'd have to 
loosen up and I would do all these 

2056
01:32:11,261 --> 01:32:14,650
exercises and shit before my body 
started feeling loose again.

2057
01:32:14,651 --> 01:32:15,484
Like I'd have to like get my back move 
and I'd get blood circulation and then 

2058
01:32:18,341 --> 01:32:21,700
once they started circulating the aix 
would kind of slowly go away.

2059
01:32:21,910 --> 01:32:23,710
I don't have any aches.
I get up,

2060
01:32:23,830 --> 01:32:24,663
I have nothing.
I just get up and it took me a while to 

2061
01:32:27,311 --> 01:32:28,660
realize that go,
oh,

2062
01:32:28,750 --> 01:32:31,420
it's gone.
Have you ever tried fasting before?

2063
01:32:31,750 --> 01:32:32,583
No,
but I do intermittent fasting so I eat 

2064
01:32:34,121 --> 01:32:35,110
at 9:00
at night.

2065
01:32:35,170 --> 01:32:36,003
Right.
And then I don't do anything until my 

2066
01:32:37,421 --> 01:32:39,220
workout.
My workout is like 10:00

2067
01:32:39,221 --> 01:32:41,680
in the morning and then I workout and 
then I eat after my workout.

2068
01:32:41,980 --> 01:32:46,980
So was for 11 hours or 12 hours or so.
I'm not eating shit.

2069
01:32:48,220 --> 01:32:49,660
See?
All on sundays.

2070
01:32:49,661 --> 01:32:51,570
I usually fast.
I stopped being saturday night,

2071
01:32:51,610 --> 01:32:54,400
usually seven.
I won't eat until the next day to seven,

2072
01:32:55,180 --> 01:32:56,380
24 hours.
That's,

2073
01:32:56,381 --> 01:33:00,070
you know,
if you have a good meal at 9:00,

2074
01:33:00,071 --> 01:33:00,904
you know,
you finished somewhere around 10 and 

2075
01:33:02,171 --> 01:33:06,280
then you let all that shit digest and 
then take that time off.

2076
01:33:06,281 --> 01:33:08,980
And then when you wake up,
like at nine or 10,

2077
01:33:09,190 --> 01:33:10,023
do a hard cardio workout,
it kicks in your body's desire to burn 

2078
01:33:13,541 --> 01:33:14,374
fat.
You can also get away with eating some 

2079
01:33:15,581 --> 01:33:16,414
sugar.
I worked out damn near seven days a 

2080
01:33:18,311 --> 01:33:19,420
week,
you know what I'm saying?

2081
01:33:19,450 --> 01:33:21,480
So you'll burn a lot of that off.
Do you know?

2082
01:33:21,481 --> 01:33:22,301
It definitely will.
I mean,

2083
01:33:22,301 --> 01:33:23,270
you're not fat.
You know what

2084
01:33:23,470 --> 01:33:24,303
the geneticists things,
you know what epigenetics needed that 

2085
01:33:30,730 --> 01:33:35,730
like a waiver.
So that was the final side.

2086
01:33:37,420 --> 01:33:38,470
Obviously a very a fit

2087
01:33:38,470 --> 01:33:39,670
guy,
you know what I mean?

2088
01:33:39,671 --> 01:33:41,470
You don't have any issues as far as like
your,

2089
01:33:41,471 --> 01:33:44,950
your appearance,
but as far as the overall performance of

2090
01:33:44,951 --> 01:33:45,784
your body,
if you just wanted to give her a goof 

2091
01:33:47,220 --> 01:33:48,520
for,
for your show,

2092
01:33:48,760 --> 01:33:51,520
you know,
just to guide people through it for fun.

2093
01:33:51,850 --> 01:33:52,780
You know,
and I know a lot.

2094
01:33:52,781 --> 01:33:53,614
I've gotten all these tweets and 
facebook messages from all these people 

2095
01:33:55,631 --> 01:33:58,150
that are trying to do it now.
I want to do some outlandish though,

2096
01:33:58,450 --> 01:34:02,470
like an old cabbage diet for a month or 
something.

2097
01:34:02,471 --> 01:34:05,890
But that's not unhealthy.
What you should do is just try it.

2098
01:34:06,700 --> 01:34:08,650
Try no sugar.
I know.

2099
01:34:08,651 --> 01:34:09,760
Look man,
I'm telling you.

2100
01:34:09,761 --> 01:34:10,594
I bought 10 bags.
Those fucking chili mango things back 

2101
01:34:12,911 --> 01:34:15,280
there in boxes,
those sugary bars,

2102
01:34:15,281 --> 01:34:16,960
because I love him,
you know,

2103
01:34:16,961 --> 01:34:20,080
but I don't like them right now.
Like that doesn't have any pull to me.

2104
01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:24,130
That's what's the most fascinating thing
about this bread killed your coding.

2105
01:34:24,190 --> 01:34:25,990
Oh yeah.
I went to dinner the other day and we're

2106
01:34:26,040 --> 01:34:26,873
is tying restaurant with my family and 
bread comes out and didn't mean shit to 

2107
01:34:29,501 --> 01:34:31,190
me.
Do you know what they find?

2108
01:34:31,191 --> 01:34:33,100
Is that this?
From what I've read and heard,

2109
01:34:33,380 --> 01:34:37,300
epigeneticists got people who study how 
you can turn genes on and off.

2110
01:34:37,570 --> 01:34:38,830
Right?
So that's a new science.

2111
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:42,370
Do you know what one of the leading 
causes of inflammation is?

2112
01:34:42,371 --> 01:34:43,204
Which I thought was fascinating.
Your gums and the food that gets stuck 

2113
01:34:47,620 --> 01:34:51,680
in the middle between your gums will 
break down as bacteria and apparently it

2114
01:34:51,690 --> 01:34:55,590
goes into the bloodstream and they're 
finding that that has a.

2115
01:34:55,870 --> 01:34:57,650
First of all,
they know that that kind of bacteria,

2116
01:34:57,651 --> 01:34:58,040
it has a lot

2117
01:34:58,040 --> 01:34:59,720
to do with your heart,
heart health,

2118
01:35:00,110 --> 01:35:03,800
but it also has a great deal to do with 
inflammation in the body,

2119
01:35:04,070 --> 01:35:04,903
which is a fascinating.
So that's why they say one of the most 

2120
01:35:08,001 --> 01:35:10,670
important things you can do is floss.
Fuck that noise.

2121
01:35:10,671 --> 01:35:11,481
I know,
but that's.

2122
01:35:11,481 --> 01:35:16,481
But that's what the floss floss floss I 
do now.

2123
01:35:18,790 --> 01:35:23,060
That will help me to floss picks.
Now I let her the past week.

2124
01:35:23,061 --> 01:35:23,894
I do it twice a day,
a dozen times in my entire life on this 

2125
01:35:27,381 --> 01:35:30,800
planet.
I never got in my lungs so bad.

2126
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:33,680
I like to pick up my gum.
Did you like those things?

2127
01:35:33,740 --> 01:35:35,810
You know what?
I like those waterpiks.

2128
01:35:35,870 --> 01:35:39,440
That's the shit.
Those are the shit and get the stuff out

2129
01:35:39,560 --> 01:35:40,393
of because it does as you sleep at 
breaks down and it goes into the 

2130
01:35:42,771 --> 01:35:47,000
bloodstream and that bacteria apparently
has a great deal to do with them.

2131
01:35:47,090 --> 01:35:48,860
That's why it's good to have a little 
gap tooth.

2132
01:35:49,670 --> 01:35:50,890
Get some gaps in your teeth.
Oh,

2133
01:35:50,910 --> 01:35:52,240
a couple of teeth out.
No,

2134
01:35:52,310 --> 01:35:54,340
you don't want that gap.
So I,

2135
01:35:54,390 --> 01:35:56,480
I used to have a thiNg for girls with 
gap teeth.

2136
01:35:56,810 --> 01:35:59,240
I'm not mad that either kind a thing for
girls.

2137
01:36:00,310 --> 01:36:01,820
I dated one.
Yeah.

2138
01:36:01,850 --> 01:36:03,090
No.
And they were dated,

2139
01:36:03,350 --> 01:36:05,100
dated a michael strahan.
Yes.

2140
01:36:05,640 --> 01:36:06,660
And it's not,
you know,

2141
01:36:06,661 --> 01:36:09,500
I'm just,
she was fucking gorgeous.

2142
01:36:09,510 --> 01:36:12,370
But I think it's hard.
I think it's hot girls would have gapped

2143
01:36:12,371 --> 01:36:13,204
too.
I'm trying to think of the hottest girl 

2144
01:36:13,850 --> 01:36:14,683
that,
uh,

2145
01:36:14,750 --> 01:36:16,460
she was a bell girl.
J.

2146
01:36:16,680 --> 01:36:17,513
J dot bryce.
Perfect example that the girl on my bad 

2147
01:36:22,120 --> 01:36:25,400
and she saw she only girl I know with a 
giant gap we were yesterday.

2148
01:36:25,510 --> 01:36:26,880
We were talking about.
I understand it.

2149
01:36:26,990 --> 01:36:27,823
She's pretty good on the planet.
She's also one of the hottest people on 

2150
01:36:31,740 --> 01:36:32,573
tooth or not.

2151
01:36:32,600 --> 01:36:34,070
Yeah,
there you go.

2152
01:36:34,071 --> 01:36:35,460
And you have to.
Yeah.

2153
01:36:35,480 --> 01:36:38,030
There's a lot of pretty women with gavin
to lauren hutton.

2154
01:36:38,060 --> 01:36:40,800
Remember that old school model?
Movie star,

2155
01:36:41,800 --> 01:36:42,633
apple gap tooth.
She was the poster girl when I was a 

2156
01:36:45,261 --> 01:36:46,190
kid.
I remember seeing her,

2157
01:36:46,310 --> 01:36:50,390
but there's some new girl now I see,
I see on billboards with just a fucking.

2158
01:36:50,680 --> 01:36:52,830
Uh huh.
Interesting.

2159
01:36:52,840 --> 01:36:53,760
Yeah.
It was injured.

2160
01:36:54,010 --> 01:36:55,440
There's lauren hutton.
God damn.

2161
01:36:55,640 --> 01:36:56,770
You know what,
that's too much gap.

2162
01:36:56,930 --> 01:36:58,100
Nope,
not that show.

2163
01:36:58,101 --> 01:36:58,934
Back when she was hot and young.
I don't want to see some old girl and 

2164
01:37:00,471 --> 01:37:03,140
she's.
She looks like fucking willy wonka.

2165
01:37:03,170 --> 01:37:04,670
Where's the gap tooth?
There it is.

2166
01:37:04,730 --> 01:37:06,200
Bam.
So my girl right there.

2167
01:37:06,230 --> 01:37:07,820
Look at that gap too.
That's a nice gap.

2168
01:37:07,821 --> 01:37:09,110
She's lucky.
She has them eyes.

2169
01:37:09,530 --> 01:37:11,000
She's beautiful.
She's good.

2170
01:37:11,480 --> 01:37:13,820
Do you guys pay attention to the 
controversy?

2171
01:37:13,940 --> 01:37:14,773
Boy,
we're really breaking down these fights 

2172
01:37:15,381 --> 01:37:16,214
and you guys pay attention to the 
controversy that these models were 

2173
01:37:19,131 --> 01:37:23,510
complaining about this oversized model 
or plus size models.

2174
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:24,770
As I said.
Oversized.

2175
01:37:25,010 --> 01:37:27,380
Sorry,
I'm oversized model.

2176
01:37:27,381 --> 01:37:30,920
I started again,
not my sports illustrated dude.

2177
01:37:30,921 --> 01:37:34,730
She's the hottest one.
Well they were saying these models,

2178
01:37:34,910 --> 01:37:38,720
these models were bitching.
Rhonda is saying that it's not healthy.

2179
01:37:39,340 --> 01:37:42,290
This is what she's doing is not healthy.
What?

2180
01:37:42,410 --> 01:37:43,243
Yeah,
because the bitch likes them and these 

2181
01:37:44,781 --> 01:37:47,180
other girls don't eat what?
I just don't like skinny girls.

2182
01:37:47,181 --> 01:37:51,500
Only other skinny got to use it,
but I only weighed 125 pounds.

2183
01:37:51,501 --> 01:37:56,020
I know we can walk around at.
What's your walk around with 40 5:50.

2184
01:37:56,070 --> 01:37:57,090
Okay.
There she is in the middle.

2185
01:37:57,380 --> 01:37:58,680
In the middle eight for you.
Creepy.

2186
01:37:59,560 --> 01:38:01,070
Some giant tatami.
Yeah.

2187
01:38:01,120 --> 01:38:04,080
Let me see more of her.
Is there more of her?

2188
01:38:04,170 --> 01:38:05,760
Well,
she's the one by the way,

2189
01:38:05,790 --> 01:38:09,800
that is not wearing fucking body pain 
that they might've put.

2190
01:38:10,170 --> 01:38:13,200
They might've put.
They might've been on rhonda.

2191
01:38:13,290 --> 01:38:14,640
You can't put body paint on them.

2192
01:38:14,640 --> 01:38:15,473
giant tathata.
You can't come late and cassie must 

2193
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:19,261
come.
Correct.

2194
01:38:19,261 --> 01:38:20,310
Pretty.
Jesus christ.

2195
01:38:20,311 --> 01:38:21,530
She's beautiful.
Come correct.

2196
01:38:22,270 --> 01:38:23,103
Alright.
Okay.

2197
01:38:23,720 --> 01:38:25,050
Alright.
Now we got to slow down.

2198
01:38:25,250 --> 01:38:29,130
We to chill out because the legs and the
hips.

2199
01:38:29,220 --> 01:38:30,053
He meanwhile,
all this young lady needs to do is a 

2200
01:38:32,701 --> 01:38:33,534
rigorous strength and conditioning 
program for a couple of weeks and she 

2201
01:38:35,620 --> 01:38:36,350
said,
oh,

2202
01:38:36,350 --> 01:38:37,183
okay.
Well we just got a little ridiculous 

2203
01:38:38,341 --> 01:38:39,030
here.
Well,

2204
01:38:39,030 --> 01:38:40,320
is that her back?
Their faces.

2205
01:38:40,470 --> 01:38:42,360
Beautiful.
She fluctuate.

2206
01:38:42,361 --> 01:38:44,520
She's super hot body.
I liked it.

2207
01:38:44,540 --> 01:38:46,110
I see that they're riGht.
It's perfect.

2208
01:38:46,170 --> 01:38:48,240
That's perfect.
Is that her okay?

2209
01:38:48,241 --> 01:38:49,140
Right there.
It's perfect.

2210
01:38:49,310 --> 01:38:53,370
She fluctuates or maybe her midsection 
looks like my mind.

2211
01:38:53,820 --> 01:38:55,200
I'm not mad.
Don't get me wroNg.

2212
01:38:55,240 --> 01:38:57,360
Out of those three girls,
she's.

2213
01:38:57,361 --> 01:38:58,650
Yeah,
I bet.

2214
01:38:58,740 --> 01:39:02,220
I bet she has no problem dealing with 
the shop.

2215
01:39:02,530 --> 01:39:03,331
Like,
You know what I'm saying?

2216
01:39:03,331 --> 01:39:03,961
Like you,
you,

2217
01:39:03,961 --> 01:39:06,060
you,
you can't like over fuck her.

2218
01:39:07,050 --> 01:39:10,020
She's ready.
Want a big man?

2219
01:39:10,060 --> 01:39:10,893
oh,
breads.

2220
01:39:10,980 --> 01:39:12,820
She's not like,
oh no,

2221
01:39:13,470 --> 01:39:13,980
no,
no.

2222
01:39:13,980 --> 01:39:15,860
You can't go hard to know that she,
she,

2223
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:19,150
she's just gonna get you a full guard.
She is your god.

2224
01:39:19,340 --> 01:39:21,540
Do her face is beautiful.
She's gorgeous.

2225
01:39:21,570 --> 01:39:22,403
She's your.
There's a lot of variety in the photos 

2226
01:39:24,901 --> 01:39:25,734
of her.
Like some of her wish she looks perfect 

2227
01:39:27,091 --> 01:39:29,140
and some of her,
which she was obviously like a little,

2228
01:39:29,210 --> 01:39:30,510
you know it's going to be true.
How old is she?

2229
01:39:30,570 --> 01:39:33,270
What does she went?
Early twenties when she's 40.

2230
01:39:33,271 --> 01:39:34,104
I don't know if that's all.
There's no such thing as one of these 

2231
01:39:35,371 --> 01:39:37,180
models that's in any,
any.

2232
01:39:37,200 --> 01:39:38,410
You know,
what do,

2233
01:39:38,460 --> 01:39:41,820
what does she weigh?
because she's 87.

2234
01:39:42,500 --> 01:39:43,930
Twenty nine.
Okay.

2235
01:39:44,010 --> 01:39:45,840
There's no such thing as these models.
When they're 40,

2236
01:39:45,841 --> 01:39:47,860
they don't exist.
Especially the plus size,

2237
01:39:48,510 --> 01:39:49,690
not the plus side one out.

2238
01:39:49,770 --> 01:39:51,150
They just don't exist.
They didn't.

2239
01:39:51,180 --> 01:39:52,013
Nobody wants to see it.
Cindy crawford's still doing the damn 

2240
01:39:53,271 --> 01:39:55,820
phone she's been on,
but that thick,

2241
01:39:55,830 --> 01:39:58,080
just she's this good for you girl.
Love the man,

2242
01:39:58,081 --> 01:39:59,850
but cindy's,
that's a full time job.

2243
01:39:59,851 --> 01:40:00,684
She's on it all day with creams and and 
I accident lotions and rubbing fucking 

2244
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:09,400
luke was all over her face and she's 
rubbing sand over face,

2245
01:40:09,931 --> 01:40:12,750
smoothing it out and exhausted,
exhausted,

2246
01:40:13,470 --> 01:40:15,310
exhausted as a sand storm.
Hey,

2247
01:40:15,330 --> 01:40:16,680
I gotta run.
I going to go for a jog.

2248
01:40:16,820 --> 01:40:18,480
She probably sees like fat,
ugly chick.

2249
01:40:18,481 --> 01:40:19,560
She was like,
I wish.

2250
01:40:19,970 --> 01:40:20,880
Who is the,
um,

2251
01:40:20,900 --> 01:40:23,550
the girl who was in body heat.
Kathleen turner,

2252
01:40:23,551 --> 01:40:26,880
turner.
She was so moved and she got,

2253
01:40:26,881 --> 01:40:31,050
she became an alcoholic.
She beat him and jamie came like,

2254
01:40:31,260 --> 01:40:33,390
drank a balloon animal.
She drank a lot.

2255
01:40:33,391 --> 01:40:34,350
She got,
she became a.

2256
01:40:34,530 --> 01:40:36,210
She blew the fuck up.
Not only that,

2257
01:40:36,260 --> 01:40:37,093
she got that balloon,
that drunk face where something happens 

2258
01:40:40,171 --> 01:40:42,180
to your nose,
your nose.

2259
01:40:44,220 --> 01:40:45,930
Look at where,
when she was upper left corner,

2260
01:40:45,931 --> 01:40:49,830
please look at that dude.
She was so hot when she was young.

2261
01:40:50,040 --> 01:40:52,190
That body heat movie,
that was night time.

2262
01:40:54,060 --> 01:40:56,100
We get her to bring her patients.
She's sniffing cock.

2263
01:40:57,590 --> 01:41:01,370
She had a real,
she had a real husky sex with this.

2264
01:41:01,810 --> 01:41:05,740
Mike smells like shit.
These things changed.

2265
01:41:05,741 --> 01:41:10,260
Can I take these off?
they don't come off your breathing.

2266
01:41:10,290 --> 01:41:11,123
Is this yours?
Just upset that I've been talking to 

2267
01:41:13,661 --> 01:41:14,494
people.
This is what's been coming out of my 

2268
01:41:15,401 --> 01:41:16,750
mouth.
I feel rude.

2269
01:41:17,320 --> 01:41:19,090
I was brushing the teeth this morning 
with dark shit.

2270
01:41:21,770 --> 01:41:23,800
Yeah,
like she was crazy about this chick.

2271
01:41:24,650 --> 01:41:27,100
This is a really hot girlfriend.
Nineteen 81.

2272
01:41:27,250 --> 01:41:28,083
If you saw her at the gym today,
billy [inaudible] probably be here more 

2273
01:41:31,121 --> 01:41:34,720
often.
I want to be a hell of an actress.

2274
01:41:34,990 --> 01:41:36,640
I want to see her.
I want to see her now.

2275
01:41:36,641 --> 01:41:37,301
Jamie.
Well,

2276
01:41:37,301 --> 01:41:41,990
the bodies that women have today are 
just better because their athlete,

2277
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:46,120
I mean better for what I like.
I like to like a gal who looks athletic.

2278
01:41:46,300 --> 01:41:49,150
Like that's what I like.
I like girls like crossfit girls.

2279
01:41:49,151 --> 01:41:50,130
Like look at her now.
She,

2280
01:41:50,140 --> 01:41:54,610
she did a lot of drinking that jesus 
christ.

2281
01:41:54,611 --> 01:41:57,460
He did a lot of training,
a lot of drinking man and women are like

2282
01:41:57,870 --> 01:42:02,870
little fucking asshole.
What a real nah man.

2283
01:42:05,560 --> 01:42:08,800
She's 50 fucking years old.
You piece of shit.

2284
01:42:09,400 --> 01:42:10,810
That's a lot of booze.
Meanwhile,

2285
01:42:10,811 --> 01:42:14,080
cindy crawford is $50 to brinkley.

2286
01:42:14,170 --> 01:42:15,960
Yes.
Christie brinkley's 90,

2287
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:19,030
9,150
years old.

2288
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:22,450
We'd all fucking fucker after you guys 
fucked her.

2289
01:42:22,451 --> 01:42:25,480
How about that?
I'm going to pretend that that's her.

2290
01:42:25,481 --> 01:42:27,700
When she was in that movie body heat,
great movie.

2291
01:42:28,620 --> 01:42:30,420
She let herself go.
Maybe she got money and says,

2292
01:42:30,530 --> 01:42:32,790
fuck you.
It's not a drink.

2293
01:42:32,860 --> 01:42:35,860
It's booze and cigarettes.
Because with that voice she smokes.

2294
01:42:36,100 --> 01:42:38,080
She had a serious drinking problem.
Did she stop?

2295
01:42:38,410 --> 01:42:40,090
I don't know,
but I know she's talks about it.

2296
01:42:40,110 --> 01:42:41,800
MayBe she had a blast.
Got some money.

2297
01:42:41,801 --> 01:42:43,500
Starts smoking.
Got fat as fuck.

2298
01:42:43,501 --> 01:42:45,680
And cadbury eggs.
I'm not mad at it.

2299
01:42:45,740 --> 01:42:47,500
It was just get tired of getting dick 
and she's like,

2300
01:42:47,501 --> 01:42:51,130
I gotta keep the deq away exhausted.
Might be gay.

2301
01:42:51,131 --> 01:42:52,150
In fact,
I think.

2302
01:42:52,730 --> 01:42:54,880
What kind of why I'm saying just think 
everybody's gaining.

2303
01:42:54,881 --> 01:42:57,700
Yeah,
I know her barrier to spread rumors.

2304
01:42:57,701 --> 01:42:58,534
So how do you do?

2305
01:42:58,600 --> 01:43:01,270
Can I do chi greens and venice a lot?
He's gonna.

2306
01:43:01,330 --> 01:43:03,110
It's gonna fuck you up.
Going to fuck.

2307
01:43:03,460 --> 01:43:05,340
Fuck you up.
I mean he's going to fuck you.

2308
01:43:06,020 --> 01:43:08,050
like he fucked that greatest straight 
way.

2309
01:43:08,290 --> 01:43:09,820
Oh,
that's hilarious.

2310
01:43:10,240 --> 01:43:11,260
Yeah,
I just don't.

2311
01:43:11,630 --> 01:43:14,650
I mean I think also the pressure of 
being a hot chick.

2312
01:43:14,830 --> 01:43:17,140
Cool.
Like it's so overwhelming.

2313
01:43:17,230 --> 01:43:18,063
I think after awhile they,
just from speaking from personal 

2314
01:43:19,901 --> 01:43:21,910
experience,
my days as a hot chick,

2315
01:43:22,300 --> 01:43:23,133
I just think it's overwhelming for those
girls to imagine your entire existence 

2316
01:43:26,171 --> 01:43:28,420
is based entirely on people wanting to 
fuck.

2317
01:43:28,421 --> 01:43:29,254
You can find on symmetry and guys just 
sending mental dick missiles at your 

2318
01:43:32,111 --> 01:43:33,610
face all day long.
Dude.

2319
01:43:33,611 --> 01:43:36,130
I used to.
I used to work at this gym where I won't

2320
01:43:36,131 --> 01:43:37,200
say her name,
but that noise,

2321
01:43:37,350 --> 01:43:38,183
a very famous mental dick muscles is a 
famous female celebrity would work out 

2322
01:43:45,041 --> 01:43:47,740
there and she would go in the shower 
before me,

2323
01:43:48,330 --> 01:43:49,930
but the pop routes he is waiting for 
outside.

2324
01:43:49,960 --> 01:43:50,793
She was in there for damn near two hours
would come out and full makeup ready 

2325
01:43:54,590 --> 01:43:55,423
because there's so much pressure because
people are just taking the time to bat 

2326
01:43:59,130 --> 01:44:00,560
for him hard.
It's hard.

2327
01:44:01,540 --> 01:44:02,373
Zellweger said that she moved to New 
York because when she'd get out to put 

2328
01:44:06,530 --> 01:44:09,500
gas in her car,
if she brushed her nose,

2329
01:44:09,501 --> 01:44:11,300
they take a picture and it looked like 
she was picking her notes.

2330
01:44:11,360 --> 01:44:13,640
She just was followed everywhere.
She was like,

2331
01:44:13,641 --> 01:44:17,270
I'm going to New York to live.
By the way,

2332
01:44:17,271 --> 01:44:18,580
for a girl like that.
Um,

2333
01:44:18,600 --> 01:44:19,700
whenever I'm around him,
I have to say,

2334
01:44:19,701 --> 01:44:21,060
by the way,
by the most,

2335
01:44:21,080 --> 01:44:24,500
that's contagious as fuck by for sure.
When I'm around him,

2336
01:44:24,501 --> 01:44:26,840
I say for sure when I'm around use by 
the way,

2337
01:44:27,120 --> 01:44:27,953
it's just exhausting to be one of those 
ladies does hot and she also had to get 

2338
01:44:33,861 --> 01:44:35,450
a fuck load of plastic surgery.

2339
01:44:36,080 --> 01:44:39,230
I mean she didn't have to,
but she did try to keep up,

2340
01:44:39,231 --> 01:44:41,570
man.
It's a fucking dog race.

2341
01:44:41,571 --> 01:44:43,340
If you're a hot chick,
it's not good.

2342
01:44:43,910 --> 01:44:45,200
Not good.
It's rough.

2343
01:44:45,310 --> 01:44:47,210
You have an expiration date to pretty 
much.

2344
01:44:47,240 --> 01:44:48,740
I mean that.
That's going away.

2345
01:44:48,970 --> 01:44:50,090
Yeah.
Patty jenkins,

2346
01:44:50,091 --> 01:44:53,330
you know our friend who's who directed 
wonder woman now and she said,

2347
01:44:53,331 --> 01:44:56,150
if you want to be humiliated,
b of a woman,

2348
01:44:56,151 --> 01:44:58,880
a female actor in her late thirties,
early forties,

2349
01:44:58,900 --> 01:45:01,010
you know when,
when you start to lose quote unquote,

2350
01:45:01,011 --> 01:45:02,780
your delicious,
as katharine hepburn said,

2351
01:45:02,990 --> 01:45:04,910
you become invisible.
Oh,

2352
01:45:04,911 --> 01:45:06,320
you want three oscars?
Awesome.

2353
01:45:06,380 --> 01:45:07,660
We'll see atlanta.
THere really aren't any,

2354
01:45:07,730 --> 01:45:09,080
any parts for it.
It's tough.

2355
01:45:09,140 --> 01:45:09,973
Even anne hathaway thought about that.
She said she was the young girl getting 

2356
01:45:11,901 --> 01:45:13,460
the parts and now she's not getting 
them.

2357
01:45:13,461 --> 01:45:14,360
She's like,
I get it.

2358
01:45:14,361 --> 01:45:17,180
It's the business.
Nineteen year olds taking my job.

2359
01:45:17,560 --> 01:45:18,940
I used To be that 19 year old.
Yeah,

2360
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:20,150
but here's the thing,
okay.

2361
01:45:20,151 --> 01:45:20,984
I can't get a job playing a black 
basketball player because I'm not a 

2362
01:45:25,791 --> 01:45:28,010
black basketball player.
You know what I'm saying?

2363
01:45:28,160 --> 01:45:32,630
I can't get a job plaYing jackie chan's 
brother because I don't look like I'd be

2364
01:45:32,631 --> 01:45:36,860
jackie chan's brother.
If you want a job as a Hot chick,

2365
01:45:36,950 --> 01:45:39,110
you have to be too hot.
Chicks,

2366
01:45:39,111 --> 01:45:41,300
right?
When you are no longer a hot chick,

2367
01:45:41,390 --> 01:45:43,550
you're going to have to get a job as a 
hot chicks mom.

2368
01:45:43,690 --> 01:45:46,850
Yeah.
That's not reality.

2369
01:45:46,851 --> 01:45:47,684
That's what.
What the fuck did you do to get famous 

2370
01:45:50,331 --> 01:45:52,820
in the first place?
You've got the genetic lottery.

2371
01:45:52,821 --> 01:45:53,654
You're mad.
Genetic lottery has an expiration date 

2372
01:45:56,400 --> 01:45:58,130
on my god.
I feel so bad.

2373
01:45:58,220 --> 01:45:59,053
It's so hard for women in this business.
It was pretty fucking easy for you to 

2374
01:46:01,690 --> 01:46:02,570
slip in the door.

2375
01:46:02,660 --> 01:46:04,010
All you have to do is have good 
features.

2376
01:46:04,020 --> 01:46:04,853
A hard for guys in this business.
THis business is ridiculous with the 

2377
01:46:08,601 --> 01:46:11,360
businesses who want to be in.
In that extent.

2378
01:46:11,361 --> 01:46:14,060
It's who wants to fuck you?
Fuck you.

2379
01:46:14,650 --> 01:46:16,190
We're going to find someone a lot of 
fuck.

2380
01:46:16,400 --> 01:46:17,233
I lost the part because my manager 
called me because I'm going to be 

2381
01:46:18,981 --> 01:46:20,570
honest.
They just said,

2382
01:46:20,571 --> 01:46:21,830
you weren't tv.
good looking enough.

2383
01:46:21,940 --> 01:46:23,030
I was like,
that makes seNse.

2384
01:46:23,120 --> 01:46:24,620
I agree with that.
That's reality.

2385
01:46:25,040 --> 01:46:26,860
That's reality.
It's not true.

2386
01:46:27,590 --> 01:46:30,170
What's not true?
Thanks to what they were trying to.

2387
01:46:30,790 --> 01:46:32,540
Well,
if they're trying to catch you as the 30

2388
01:46:32,541 --> 01:46:34,010
something single guy.
Yeah,

2389
01:46:34,011 --> 01:46:34,844
probably new like my age.
I'm lost with the plane crashed and you 

2390
01:46:38,061 --> 01:46:41,600
were fairly rugged and you took care of 
some older women and they wanted to fuck

2391
01:46:41,601 --> 01:46:43,460
you.
You're the guy.

2392
01:46:43,620 --> 01:46:44,930
Yes.
My buddy frank.

2393
01:46:44,931 --> 01:46:48,130
You know How to make a fire with my 
buddy frank grillo.

2394
01:46:48,131 --> 01:46:50,040
The greatest guy will call me up.
He'd be like,

2395
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:51,870
dude,
you got to get down on this audition and

2396
01:46:51,871 --> 01:46:52,704
I would call my h and m bitch and 
finally my eights and david letterman 

2397
01:46:55,530 --> 01:46:56,640
goes,
brian,

2398
01:46:56,700 --> 01:46:57,533
he just stopped me because brian,
you have to stop calling me about the 

2399
01:47:00,991 --> 01:47:03,450
audition.
Frank grillo goes on and I said,

2400
01:47:03,451 --> 01:47:03,930
why?
He goes,

2401
01:47:03,930 --> 01:47:07,200
because you don't look like franklin,
his casting.

2402
01:47:07,380 --> 01:47:09,960
You could play his friend but you don't 
have his hair.

2403
01:47:09,961 --> 01:47:12,570
His look and he just,
he got mad at me and I was like,

2404
01:47:12,600 --> 01:47:14,250
you know what?
You're absolutely right.

2405
01:47:14,300 --> 01:47:18,340
I don't know how it so goes and you 
can't get upset at that because that's.

2406
01:47:18,540 --> 01:47:22,170
You got in just as easy.
You didn't get a goddamn phd to be a hot

2407
01:47:22,171 --> 01:47:22,900
chick.
You know?

2408
01:47:22,900 --> 01:47:27,900
It sounded like you fucking scoured the 
world and and busted your ass 16 hours a

2409
01:47:28,561 --> 01:47:29,394
day,
going through doctorate your 

2410
01:47:31,021 --> 01:47:33,420
dissertation and fucking writing books.

2411
01:47:33,530 --> 01:47:35,760
No pretty girl,
no cetera.

2412
01:47:35,850 --> 01:47:36,683
Pretend for you to be upset that people 
don't care about you because you turned 

2413
01:47:40,471 --> 01:47:41,191
40.
Well,

2414
01:47:41,191 --> 01:47:43,050
guess what?
You're in the wrong god damn business.

2415
01:47:43,230 --> 01:47:44,063
They're not going to care about you when
you're dead either and you're going to 

2416
01:47:45,661 --> 01:47:46,494
die.
So there's a certain reality to the 

2417
01:47:48,541 --> 01:47:49,374
expiration date of the occupation that 
you've chosen because you've signed up 

2418
01:47:52,770 --> 01:47:53,603
for sports too.
And this is not the fucking businesses 

2419
01:47:56,281 --> 01:47:58,020
responsibility,
you know?

2420
01:47:58,021 --> 01:47:58,521
I mean,
I,

2421
01:47:58,521 --> 01:47:59,354
I was friends with the guy who's asian 
who's always complaining about the lack 

2422
01:48:03,421 --> 01:48:06,240
of asian roles in hollywood,
and I was like,

2423
01:48:06,270 --> 01:48:06,960
well,
okay,

2424
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:10,350
but they don't have to write a movie 
about asian people.

2425
01:48:10,500 --> 01:48:11,090
THey're like,
well,

2426
01:48:11,090 --> 01:48:11,701
he's like,
well,

2427
01:48:11,701 --> 01:48:13,230
it's a close system.
Well,

2428
01:48:13,410 --> 01:48:14,243
okay,
you've got to figure out a way through 

2429
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:16,673
the system.
There's a certain way that has to be 

2430
01:48:19,861 --> 01:48:20,694
available to someone to get a gig and 
they shouldn't have to cast you just 

2431
01:48:25,590 --> 01:48:27,630
because there's no asian people and 
they're moving.

2432
01:48:27,660 --> 01:48:28,493
Well,
that's gone,

2433
01:48:28,790 --> 01:48:30,270
that's going on in hollywood for 
example,

2434
01:48:30,271 --> 01:48:32,910
like the black issue in hollywood.
Look,

2435
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,910
black people take up what 12 percent of 
the population in this country.

2436
01:48:36,710 --> 01:48:37,543
There are a lot of very talented black 
people as there are a lot of very 

2437
01:48:39,121 --> 01:48:41,550
talented people,
but the bottom line is moneywise,

2438
01:48:41,850 --> 01:48:42,683
you know there's more money and making 
sort of movies that are geared maybe 

2439
01:48:46,890 --> 01:48:51,180
toward a white populace only because 
that's the economics.

2440
01:48:51,181 --> 01:48:52,014
There are a whole lot more audience 
members that are white and and the 

2441
01:48:56,011 --> 01:48:58,920
infrastructure,
Yes is already fairly white,

2442
01:48:59,250 --> 01:49:00,083
so It's going to take some time,
but two to mandate or to kind of scold 

2443
01:49:03,391 --> 01:49:04,224
hollywood because there aren't enough 
vehicles or roles for black people or 

2444
01:49:09,510 --> 01:49:10,343
asian people.
It seems to me to be a little bit 

2445
01:49:13,380 --> 01:49:15,840
disingenuous.
I understand the frustration,

2446
01:49:15,841 --> 01:49:17,970
but come on man,
at the end of the day,

2447
01:49:18,060 --> 01:49:21,090
it's reflective of demographics,
isn't it?

2448
01:49:21,120 --> 01:49:24,990
Isn't it reflective of the fact that 12 
percent of the population or are african

2449
01:49:24,991 --> 01:49:25,824
american?
Most of this country is still white and 

2450
01:49:28,771 --> 01:49:29,604
it's still a business?
I think it's still a business on 

2451
01:49:31,270 --> 01:49:32,103
addition.
A couple months ago when grain was 

2452
01:49:34,020 --> 01:49:34,853
between me and one other guy and the 
other guy was african american male 

2453
01:49:36,860 --> 01:49:37,693
agent called me.
He goes,

2454
01:49:38,010 --> 01:49:39,300
man,
you did great.

2455
01:49:39,470 --> 01:49:42,510
You they think you're better,
but they're there.

2456
01:49:42,630 --> 01:49:45,090
They're gonna.
Go with the better.

2457
01:49:45,091 --> 01:49:46,530
Yeah,
they think you're better than to go with

2458
01:49:46,550 --> 01:49:47,383
african americans.
they want diversity because they don't 

2459
01:49:48,971 --> 01:49:50,400
want to get people upset at.
First of all,

2460
01:49:50,401 --> 01:49:51,350
it's a fact.
First of all,

2461
01:49:51,351 --> 01:49:52,750
first of all,
there's effective.

2462
01:49:53,160 --> 01:49:55,810
If it's effective,
you're casting a movie tv show.

2463
01:49:55,811 --> 01:49:57,810
Now it is a fact that,
and I,

2464
01:49:57,970 --> 01:49:58,803
I just know this,
that you have to cast a certain number 

2465
01:50:01,901 --> 01:50:05,500
of people have quote unquote color that 
is,

2466
01:50:06,610 --> 01:50:07,720
you don't have to.

2467
01:50:07,810 --> 01:50:10,990
You don't have to,
but if you want to avoid criticism,

2468
01:50:11,050 --> 01:50:13,150
and that's one of the reasons why this 
criticism exists,

2469
01:50:13,450 --> 01:50:14,283
is criticism.
It's essentially like an affirmative 

2470
01:50:15,641 --> 01:50:18,310
action for acting.
It says nfl too.

2471
01:50:18,311 --> 01:50:19,144
You know,
if you're hiring a head coach and then 

2472
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:22,600
you have to interview a black coach,
you have to.

2473
01:50:22,870 --> 01:50:24,940
It's required.
You have to interview a black coach,

2474
01:50:25,210 --> 01:50:27,940
so you might have six white guys and 
you're like,

2475
01:50:27,941 --> 01:50:29,320
fuck,
the sixth one's really good.

2476
01:50:29,321 --> 01:50:30,154
I knOw,
but you've got to put in this inferior 

2477
01:50:31,061 --> 01:50:32,790
black yet we have to do.
They're trying to do.

2478
01:50:32,830 --> 01:50:33,663
They're trying to equalize the playing 
field and create equality of 

2479
01:50:35,891 --> 01:50:37,420
opportunity,
which is a good thing.

2480
01:50:37,690 --> 01:50:39,820
I just don't know if that's the best way
to do it.

2481
01:50:39,850 --> 01:50:41,140
Well,
what is the best way to do it?

2482
01:50:41,230 --> 01:50:42,063
Best way to do it is to a meritocracy 
and create opportunities for people of 

2483
01:50:45,400 --> 01:50:49,420
all ilks and all colors earlier,
earlier,

2484
01:50:49,421 --> 01:50:51,070
nurture,
nurture,

2485
01:50:51,160 --> 01:50:52,390
various cultures.

2486
01:50:52,450 --> 01:50:54,550
Nurture the Idea that,
hey,

2487
01:50:54,820 --> 01:50:57,760
instead of taking this path,
maybe there's another path.

2488
01:50:57,970 --> 01:51:01,390
I'd love to see more black.
For example,

2489
01:51:01,391 --> 01:51:02,224
let's just take black more black 
scientists and doctors over more black 

2490
01:51:06,131 --> 01:51:08,150
actors and things like that.
Yeah,

2491
01:51:08,820 --> 01:51:12,290
but know you just saying they want to do
the way you do it.

2492
01:51:12,291 --> 01:51:15,070
As you nurture those communities when 
they're still young,

2493
01:51:15,071 --> 01:51:18,160
I'm undergoing possibilities.
Best guys should get the job.

2494
01:51:18,190 --> 01:51:20,470
I don't care.
It doesn't matter.

2495
01:51:20,940 --> 01:51:24,160
I think that's true too,
but I also think we've got to figure out

2496
01:51:24,161 --> 01:51:27,940
why those people aren't getting 
opportunities.

2497
01:51:27,941 --> 01:51:32,470
Like what is it that is the question.
That's the same opportunities.

2498
01:51:32,920 --> 01:51:34,390
They're not born with the same 
opportunity.

2499
01:51:34,391 --> 01:51:39,220
They were given a shitty deal as far as 
the hand that you're dealt as at birth.

2500
01:51:39,280 --> 01:51:44,280
That's got to fix the haNd,
but also keep in mind when you.

2501
01:51:44,590 --> 01:51:46,000
First of all you're talking about black 
people,

2502
01:51:46,030 --> 01:51:47,150
gay people,
whIte people.

2503
01:51:47,150 --> 01:51:52,150
It's so ridiculous with very different.
A black from black people and gay people

2504
01:51:52,391 --> 01:51:53,224
to get to a black person.
I'm in Nigeria is very different than a 

2505
01:51:54,821 --> 01:51:56,860
black guy from who grew up in South 
Carolina.

2506
01:51:56,861 --> 01:51:58,510
It's just a completelY different culture
and everything.

2507
01:51:58,720 --> 01:51:59,553
The black,
the african immigrant immigrant 

2508
01:52:01,421 --> 01:52:02,254
experience in this country is not so 
different from a lot of other immigrant 

2509
01:52:06,581 --> 01:52:08,300
experiences.
Um,

2510
01:52:08,350 --> 01:52:13,350
so culture plays a factor in Where 
people start and end as well.

2511
01:52:14,921 --> 01:52:16,930
We don't talk enough about that.
We don't.

2512
01:52:16,931 --> 01:52:17,764
It's very taboo to suggest maybe your 
culture if you're a white guy from the 

2513
01:52:21,851 --> 01:52:22,684
appalachian mountains,
isn't as effective for this marketplace 

2514
01:52:26,560 --> 01:52:29,500
as the culture of a northeastern white 
guy.

2515
01:52:29,800 --> 01:52:33,040
Maybe your culture if you come from a 
black minister,

2516
01:52:33,100 --> 01:52:37,630
Mississippi black mississippians 
neighborhood or or wherever data $5,000

2517
01:52:37,631 --> 01:52:39,500
from in that,
that documentary,

2518
01:52:41,570 --> 01:52:45,710
it's chicken,
but that coke

2519
01:52:46,110 --> 01:52:46,943
soda.
What are the deficits in that culture 

2520
01:52:47,841 --> 01:52:48,674
compared to the deaf to the advantages 
of being a black kenyon or a black 

2521
01:52:52,370 --> 01:52:54,310
nigerian that seems to work in this 
marketplace.

2522
01:52:54,320 --> 01:52:55,153
Let's start talking about that.
If you don't want to have a discussion 

2523
01:52:56,571 --> 01:52:57,600
about that,
maybe you don't care.

2524
01:52:57,640 --> 01:52:58,473
I don't know what you just said,
so I can't really agree with what I'm 

2525
01:52:59,990 --> 01:53:00,823
saying is that culture plays a factor 
when you solved the problem is look at 

2526
01:53:04,650 --> 01:53:06,990
how kids are raised.
Start with there.

2527
01:53:07,390 --> 01:53:08,223
Well,
I think for sure we have a problem in 

2528
01:53:09,681 --> 01:53:14,681
this country where there's communities 
where people are grown growing up,

2529
01:53:14,900 --> 01:53:18,020
where it's just despair,
despair and crime.

2530
01:53:18,110 --> 01:53:20,060
BaltiMore,
detroit,

2531
01:53:20,310 --> 01:53:21,143
me keep going down the list of terrible 
communities where people are born that 

2532
01:53:24,920 --> 01:53:27,200
no one's doing anything to try to fix.
The government,

2533
01:53:27,350 --> 01:53:29,180
looks at all these problems that are 
having.

2534
01:53:29,360 --> 01:53:31,550
the people are having another other 
countries and they're like,

2535
01:53:31,551 --> 01:53:33,440
we have to help these syrian refugees.

2536
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:36,260
We have to help.
We help people in detroit too,

2537
01:53:36,261 --> 01:53:37,094
man.
You know how help people that are 

2538
01:53:38,650 --> 01:53:41,240
hurting are,
but you're also dealing with a legacy of

2539
01:53:41,241 --> 01:53:43,040
raid.
That's where racism is a legacy.

2540
01:53:43,160 --> 01:53:45,320
Where black,
what black people were redlined.

2541
01:53:45,350 --> 01:53:47,690
Well,
I had this guy Michael Wood on who was a

2542
01:53:47,691 --> 01:53:49,310
cop,
how baltimore is a good one,

2543
01:53:49,340 --> 01:53:52,060
great fucking guy,
super articulate,

2544
01:53:52,070 --> 01:53:52,903
smart,
and he's actually running for mayor of 

2545
01:53:53,751 --> 01:53:58,550
chicago or excuse me for the head of 
police or chicago right now and well,

2546
01:53:58,551 --> 01:53:59,384
I hope he wins because he's got the 
right idea and he was a cop and he's 

2547
01:54:02,030 --> 01:54:02,863
fucking super honest guy,
but he said that the way baltimore was 

2548
01:54:05,931 --> 01:54:06,764
set up,
you literally couldn't sell black 

2549
01:54:08,661 --> 01:54:12,290
people.
How white called being redlined in every

2550
01:54:12,291 --> 01:54:13,124
community.
Why is there a black ghetto in almost 

2551
01:54:14,151 --> 01:54:16,010
every community?
That's a bad part of town.

2552
01:54:16,070 --> 01:54:17,120
How?
What a coincidence.

2553
01:54:17,120 --> 01:54:17,953
It's black.
You couldn't get a loan for a house 

2554
01:54:19,581 --> 01:54:23,210
unless it was in within these lines.
THat's how it was.

2555
01:54:23,211 --> 01:54:24,044
That was,
that's what you call institutionalized 

2556
01:54:25,011 --> 01:54:30,011
racism and the people they didn't own 
those houses they were renting and weird

2557
01:54:30,280 --> 01:54:31,780
is there's.
There's really no.

2558
01:54:31,790 --> 01:54:32,623
If you think about it,
just to go back to what we're supposed 

2559
01:54:34,731 --> 01:54:36,320
to be talking about.
If you go back to it,

2560
01:54:36,321 --> 01:54:40,940
there's really no black female fighters.
Angela hill.

2561
01:54:41,660 --> 01:54:43,880
okay.
Who was mad at me by the way,

2562
01:54:44,390 --> 01:54:46,820
for at 1:35
percent fried chicken.

2563
01:54:47,060 --> 01:54:49,340
She sits,
she made a twitter post,

2564
01:54:49,580 --> 01:54:50,413
says this is what she hears,
and she had a a clip of me from my 2005 

2565
01:54:55,790 --> 01:54:58,670
showtime special where I said there's 
three magic words.

2566
01:54:59,460 --> 01:55:02,660
Love con in nigger.
Those are the three magic words.

2567
01:55:02,960 --> 01:55:05,860
And like in the last one,
you can't even say out loud,

2568
01:55:05,960 --> 01:55:06,710
not even calling.

2569
01:55:06,710 --> 01:55:09,620
Somebody can't say it out loud.
Say it out loud.

2570
01:55:09,621 --> 01:55:11,030
People could beat the fuck out of you 
for sure.

2571
01:55:11,070 --> 01:55:12,110
I mean,
that was the point of the bit,

2572
01:55:12,200 --> 01:55:14,360
so she took an excerpt of that and she 
said,

2573
01:55:14,361 --> 01:55:17,780
this is what I hear when he says that,
and she'll.

2574
01:55:17,840 --> 01:55:20,030
She was super upset.
Is the planning.

2575
01:55:20,540 --> 01:55:21,373
It is disappointing at 1:35.
There's not a lot of african americans 

2576
01:55:25,790 --> 01:55:26,910
in the female division.
No,

2577
01:55:26,911 --> 01:55:27,531
there's no.
There's some,

2578
01:55:27,531 --> 01:55:28,364
but it's nice that for especially women,
but if you think about there's some 

2579
01:55:31,100 --> 01:55:33,170
beast african american women.
It's a new sport.

2580
01:55:33,380 --> 01:55:35,270
Fucking monsters.
Wait until they get into it.

2581
01:55:35,510 --> 01:55:36,343
Wait til you have too little.
Serena williams sisters who maybe I 

2582
01:55:38,490 --> 01:55:42,470
should fight.
See everybody fucking athletes.

2583
01:55:42,471 --> 01:55:47,450
So there's old lady.
Hey people,

2584
01:55:47,550 --> 01:55:50,190
black people her,
she's white,

2585
01:55:50,210 --> 01:55:54,780
but her kids are black or half and her 
daughter looks like venus and serena,

2586
01:55:54,840 --> 01:55:57,390
she's 15 and he,
we should play tennis together.

2587
01:55:57,840 --> 01:55:59,460
Fuck you.
How fast,

2588
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:00,590
how fast you serve.
She goes,

2589
01:56:00,600 --> 01:56:01,930
oh,
a little over $100.

2590
01:56:02,070 --> 01:56:02,903
Why the fuck would I want you serving a 
ball at me and make a play tennis with 

2591
01:56:06,421 --> 01:56:08,180
callan?
Callan is a fucking stopped.

2592
01:56:08,770 --> 01:56:10,740
When I hit takes,
he takes lessons.

2593
01:56:10,741 --> 01:56:13,340
You're the pro bodybuilder.
Gag.

2594
01:56:13,350 --> 01:56:18,350
I go back and I go,
it's a long one.

2595
01:56:19,950 --> 01:56:21,400
God never go surf.
I go,

2596
01:56:21,490 --> 01:56:23,760
eat,
eat my dick.

2597
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:29,000
That's a good thing to say because 
there's lots of flies right by you.

2598
01:56:29,910 --> 01:56:31,170
Say,
eat my dick.

2599
01:56:32,160 --> 01:56:32,993
Yeah,
but wait to with the african american 

2600
01:56:34,111 --> 01:56:35,280
girls go,
you know what,

2601
01:56:35,370 --> 01:56:37,200
we can kind of make money in this fight 
game.

2602
01:56:37,340 --> 01:56:38,630
Well,
you get the white girls are fun.

2603
01:56:38,670 --> 01:56:41,460
A lot of russian and a lot of pole like,
you know,

2604
01:56:41,470 --> 01:56:44,290
you,
you want to check and uh,

2605
01:56:44,640 --> 01:56:48,390
there's,
there's a lot of molly tie in europe and

2606
01:56:48,391 --> 01:56:49,224
in Russia and I think a lot of those 
athletes are going to leak into mma and 

2607
01:56:54,150 --> 01:56:55,950
muscle farm issue.

2608
01:56:56,040 --> 01:56:57,810
She's doing summer camp up muscle 
thoughts.

2609
01:56:57,811 --> 01:56:58,644
Great.
I would also suggest that black being a 

2610
01:57:00,900 --> 01:57:01,733
super whatever athlete as a black.
There's only one black champion right 

2611
01:57:06,481 --> 01:57:06,871
now,
right?

2612
01:57:06,871 --> 01:57:11,871
You got luke rockhold johnson is the 
current champion.

2613
01:57:13,030 --> 01:57:14,680
St John Jones.
Okay.

2614
01:57:15,360 --> 01:57:17,690
And then you've got really,
let's say John Jones,

2615
01:57:17,730 --> 01:57:19,770
then you got in the heavyweight 
division,

2616
01:57:19,771 --> 01:57:20,604
it's a fabric to have our doom.
then you've got robbie lawler who's 

2617
01:57:23,850 --> 01:57:27,540
filipino and white,
and then you've got at 4:55.

2618
01:57:27,570 --> 01:57:30,360
Does filipino and white.
Why did I not know that?

2619
01:57:30,361 --> 01:57:31,530
That's on?
Just then you got.

2620
01:57:31,531 --> 01:57:34,400
So it's mighty mouse and john jay.
Yeah.

2621
01:57:34,440 --> 01:57:37,160
Hoffeld this on joe's.
Well connor.

2622
01:57:38,280 --> 01:57:40,110
Yeah.
Mighty mouse and,

2623
01:57:40,210 --> 01:57:41,043
and,
and daniel's the to keep saying jon 

2624
01:57:42,541 --> 01:57:45,070
jones.
Daniel cormier is the champ.

2625
01:57:45,120 --> 01:57:50,120
I apologize daniel.
kind of because I watched jon jones beat

2626
01:57:50,701 --> 01:57:53,180
the fuck,
but I didn't watch out of him,

2627
01:57:53,190 --> 01:57:54,210
but he didn't disagree.

2628
01:57:54,210 --> 01:57:56,100
He broke him.
He won.

2629
01:57:56,550 --> 01:57:57,840
He definitely won.
He broke them.

2630
01:57:57,870 --> 01:58:01,350
When is that fight happening?
April 23rd I think is already billboards

2631
01:58:01,351 --> 01:58:02,330
for it.
What'd you get?

2632
01:58:02,750 --> 01:58:06,300
What'd you call calling that?
Jon jones motivated and in shape.

2633
01:58:06,301 --> 01:58:08,460
Power lifting is a dangerous 
motherfucker.

2634
01:58:08,880 --> 01:58:11,610
But how much of this is bs?
You know,

2635
01:58:11,790 --> 01:58:12,800
we don't,
we never faked.

2636
01:58:12,930 --> 01:58:14,520
So he's bigger,
stronger,

2637
01:58:14,521 --> 01:58:17,430
faster with time off,
and he already beat them before.

2638
01:58:17,880 --> 01:58:19,230
Well also,
um,

2639
01:58:19,560 --> 01:58:20,393
it seems like he's on the straight and 
narrow and he's training all the time 

2640
01:58:23,660 --> 01:58:24,800
posting to instagram.
Why?

2641
01:58:24,890 --> 01:58:26,240
I think it's,
I don't know,

2642
01:58:26,250 --> 01:58:28,930
because our lawsky this is the only 
reason why I questioned at all or lawsky

2643
01:58:28,950 --> 01:58:32,000
said he's never in the gym for arlovski,
you know,

2644
01:58:32,120 --> 01:58:34,320
might not like who's this?
John's.

2645
01:58:34,440 --> 01:58:35,850
Yeah.
When did he say then?

2646
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:36,833
Recently he might,
they might be coming at different times 

2647
01:58:38,341 --> 01:58:41,530
or are laskey might've been quoted,
but it might've been an older quote,

2648
01:58:41,810 --> 01:58:42,190
you know,

2649
01:58:42,190 --> 01:58:43,170
he might've been,
you know,

2650
01:58:43,280 --> 01:58:48,280
talking about six months ago it was john
with no camp camp doesn't fucking matter

2651
01:58:49,001 --> 01:58:51,160
to this dudes beating people the fuck 
up.

2652
01:58:51,370 --> 01:58:53,230
Well joHn and shape and motivated.
So,

2653
01:58:53,231 --> 01:58:54,070
you know,
it's interesting.

2654
01:58:54,071 --> 01:58:57,250
One of the things that he said that I 
think was really honeSt and intense,

2655
01:58:57,460 --> 01:59:02,460
he said he used to always give himself 
an excuse for losing.

2656
01:59:02,890 --> 01:59:04,930
So like if I lost,
I'd be like,

2657
01:59:04,931 --> 01:59:07,240
well I didn't even really train,
wait till I train.

2658
01:59:07,300 --> 01:59:08,440
And then.
But he kept winninG,

2659
01:59:08,950 --> 01:59:10,660
you know,
it was saying this,

2660
01:59:10,960 --> 01:59:13,450
this fight,
he's not doing that and this fight.

2661
01:59:13,451 --> 01:59:17,560
He is like in some serious shape.
The power lifting shit is no joke,

2662
01:59:17,561 --> 01:59:18,394
man.
When you're watching them do all that 

2663
01:59:18,761 --> 01:59:20,890
power lifting heavy dead lifts,
I'm like 500 pounds,

2664
01:59:20,891 --> 01:59:22,570
whatever it is a lot,
but it's.

2665
01:59:22,571 --> 01:59:25,030
The point is his body has obviously 
changed,

2666
01:59:25,031 --> 01:59:27,520
like he's been putting some serious work
in.

2667
01:59:27,760 --> 01:59:28,593
there's no doubt about it.
You can see the physical results in his 

2668
01:59:30,221 --> 01:59:31,270
body.
He's biGger.

2669
01:59:31,271 --> 01:59:32,200
I just,
I don't.

2670
01:59:32,201 --> 01:59:33,900
And I love dc.
You know this dc.

2671
01:59:33,901 --> 01:59:35,050
I love them.
I have worked on the.

2672
01:59:35,290 --> 01:59:38,080
I just don't see dc having the skills to
beat him.

2673
01:59:38,260 --> 01:59:40,690
I don't see it happening.
What would dcf do differently?

2674
01:59:40,691 --> 01:59:43,240
Because you have to do something to 
train with kane.

2675
01:59:43,300 --> 01:59:44,410
That's the big one.
Well,

2676
01:59:44,480 --> 01:59:47,350
peace out,
but cain is injured obviously.

2677
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:48,833
Yeah,
but cain was a big part of his training 

2678
01:59:51,131 --> 01:59:51,964
camp and cane like having cane as a 
click on that fucking video of him 

2679
01:59:56,021 --> 01:59:57,850
kicking.
Go to that one right there.

2680
01:59:57,880 --> 02:00:00,430
Let me see that.
Let me see.

2681
02:00:00,431 --> 02:00:02,410
This got jacked.
His.

2682
02:00:02,580 --> 02:00:05,620
He's in some serious shit.
I want to see his kicks because that's a

2683
02:00:05,621 --> 02:00:06,850
big part of his game,
man.

2684
02:00:08,080 --> 02:00:09,280
God,
doug.

2685
02:00:09,910 --> 02:00:12,610
I can help them with that move as from 
foot first.

2686
02:00:12,750 --> 02:00:14,950
I'm going to talk to him,
but that's what you're supposed to do is

2687
02:00:15,090 --> 02:00:16,300
step out and then you can.
You don't have to.

2688
02:00:16,310 --> 02:00:18,040
You just wouldn't know.
You.

2689
02:00:18,041 --> 02:00:20,220
Turn your fucking front foot man.
Don't ever,

2690
02:00:20,290 --> 02:00:23,410
ever turn your shoulder.
Ever get me kicked out because I can see

2691
02:00:23,411 --> 02:00:24,970
you there.
You don't know what you're talking.

2692
02:00:25,430 --> 02:00:28,240
He uses it all the time.
You turned your front foot first.

2693
02:00:28,241 --> 02:00:29,074
It's the most imPortant part of you.
Keep your body exactly the same or you 

2694
02:00:31,670 --> 02:00:32,503
pivot on that foot when you go up in 
your heel and you can get a lot of 

2695
02:00:34,061 --> 02:00:35,800
power.
Which showing how the kickoff.

2696
02:00:36,130 --> 02:00:40,720
I will 100 percent in 2016.
Please let me show you a kickoff.

2697
02:00:41,080 --> 02:00:42,820
You'll see.
We'll go in the back after the.

2698
02:00:43,330 --> 02:00:47,890
Oh,
he definitely could do this better,

2699
02:00:48,160 --> 02:00:52,270
but what's important is that you know 
who's gonna I,

2700
02:00:52,280 --> 02:00:55,840
I,
I Just don't think we know at dc.

2701
02:00:55,840 --> 02:00:58,450
Brings that crazy relentless pace.
Boxing.

2702
02:00:58,451 --> 02:00:59,420
Wrestling.
Yeah.

2703
02:00:59,590 --> 02:01:00,120
What's he.
What's he?

2704
02:01:00,120 --> 02:01:02,440
Gonna do start kicking.
What's he gonna do different.

2705
02:01:02,441 --> 02:01:03,274
I'd love to hear it and I love dc,
but we don't know how much of all the 

2706
02:01:07,941 --> 02:01:08,774
shit talking and the eMotions and all 
that stuff played a factor in his 

2707
02:01:11,380 --> 02:01:13,810
preparation and his execution During the
fight.

2708
02:01:13,960 --> 02:01:16,750
We don't know.
We won't know until we see them go at it

2709
02:01:16,751 --> 02:01:17,584
again.
We don't know how much of a factor cane 

2710
02:01:19,390 --> 02:01:20,223
would play because canes not as camp 
right now because ken got injured 

2711
02:01:22,811 --> 02:01:24,790
training for for So he's not there 
again.

2712
02:01:24,820 --> 02:01:29,820
Not and cain had fucking back surgery,
which is some serious shit.

2713
02:01:30,401 --> 02:01:33,520
He up for trunk of his disc removed or 
dude.

2714
02:01:34,690 --> 02:01:35,523
Well,
it's also not necessarily necessary 

2715
02:01:37,570 --> 02:01:38,403
because matt brown went through same 
injury and matt brown didn't bother 

2716
02:01:40,731 --> 02:01:41,564
getting surgery and cm punk won and got 
surgery too and I have been through it 

2717
02:01:45,561 --> 02:01:48,260
and I didn't get surgery,
but that's where I got that machine that

2718
02:01:48,261 --> 02:01:49,650
reverse hyper that's in the back.

2719
02:01:50,270 --> 02:01:52,010
All the yoga that I did all the other 
different.

2720
02:01:52,011 --> 02:01:52,844
There's a bunch of different treatments 
that you could do to take care of a 

2721
02:01:55,071 --> 02:01:58,010
bulging disc and they involve 
lengthening your body,

2722
02:01:58,130 --> 02:02:01,590
stretching and decompressing your spine.
And it heals it.

2723
02:02:01,660 --> 02:02:04,130
It can heal itself,
but is supposed to be faster,

2724
02:02:04,131 --> 02:02:04,890
right?
Yes.

2725
02:02:04,890 --> 02:02:06,560
But it's also permanent,
man.

2726
02:02:06,680 --> 02:02:09,560
He take away that chunk of disk,
that chunk of disc is gone now,

2727
02:02:09,561 --> 02:02:10,460
man.
It's gone.

2728
02:02:10,490 --> 02:02:11,570
What?
They replace it though,

2729
02:02:11,580 --> 02:02:12,413
correct.
Replacing a disectomy what cain went 

2730
02:02:15,081 --> 02:02:16,730
through.
What he's got is a bulge,

2731
02:02:16,731 --> 02:02:18,170
right?
I'm not a doctor.

2732
02:02:18,280 --> 02:02:20,360
Just wants to that record.
So here's this,

2733
02:02:20,600 --> 02:02:21,470
here's this back.
Right.

2734
02:02:21,690 --> 02:02:22,523
So here's the spinal column.
And then he's got his discs right next 

2735
02:02:25,311 --> 02:02:25,611
to it.
Well,

2736
02:02:25,611 --> 02:02:29,030
one of his bulging disk is pushing 
against his spine,

2737
02:02:29,060 --> 02:02:29,830
dan.
Okay.

2738
02:02:29,830 --> 02:02:32,180
So spinal column,
like his spine,

2739
02:02:32,190 --> 02:02:34,580
she's actual spine.
That's where you get nerve pains.

2740
02:02:34,610 --> 02:02:37,490
But that's why.
That's why you have um,

2741
02:02:37,960 --> 02:02:41,000
a dyadic comes from.
And for me,

2742
02:02:41,001 --> 02:02:42,560
I had a,
I had at both places,

2743
02:02:42,561 --> 02:02:44,540
I had a little bit of a psychotic at one
point in time.

2744
02:02:44,541 --> 02:02:47,270
And then I had it in my fingers.
The fingers was real bad though,

2745
02:02:47,271 --> 02:02:48,670
but that was cervical.
Um,

2746
02:02:48,980 --> 02:02:52,340
when it happens,
they just go in there,

2747
02:02:52,430 --> 02:02:53,263
they open you up,
they cut that piece out and then go 

2748
02:02:55,611 --> 02:02:56,444
back.
And so now it's not pressing up against 

2749
02:02:58,341 --> 02:02:59,174
you,
but a chunk of your discount and you 

2750
02:03:02,151 --> 02:03:02,661
know,
you,

2751
02:03:02,661 --> 02:03:03,494
you have less friction.
They're not necessarily either way that 

2752
02:03:05,991 --> 02:03:08,510
mother fucker's not back for dc.
Exactly.

2753
02:03:09,360 --> 02:03:10,940
He's not going to be bad.
Not back for dc.

2754
02:03:11,030 --> 02:03:14,870
Matt brown fixed it and matt brown fixed
it with louie simmons.

2755
02:03:14,920 --> 02:03:18,350
Same guy who created that reverse hyper 
west side barbell.

2756
02:03:18,530 --> 02:03:19,363
I mean he went through a bunch of 
exercises and a bunch of different 

2757
02:03:20,991 --> 02:03:21,690
things to fix it.

2758
02:03:21,690 --> 02:03:24,680
There's ways to fix it depending upon,
of course,

2759
02:03:24,830 --> 02:03:25,663
how bad the injury is with some people 
it's herniated to the point where they 

2760
02:03:28,251 --> 02:03:29,084
have to remove the disc tissue and 
either put a spacer in there or the 

2761
02:03:31,941 --> 02:03:33,200
fuse.
The two discs together.

2762
02:03:33,350 --> 02:03:38,350
Spacer is generally thought to be the 
better move for athletics.

2763
02:03:38,361 --> 02:03:39,860
That's what I thought they did with 
cane.

2764
02:03:40,190 --> 02:03:41,030
No,
no,

2765
02:03:41,080 --> 02:03:41,913
they,
they did a disectomy because they did a 

2766
02:03:42,921 --> 02:03:43,754
space or he's out for a long time 
because you just know there's no 

2767
02:03:46,341 --> 02:03:48,620
wrestling going on for a long time.
For awhile though.

2768
02:03:48,621 --> 02:03:49,790
Correct?
Just a few months.

2769
02:03:50,330 --> 02:03:54,770
I just can't believe that that jon jones
took daniel down twice.

2770
02:03:54,771 --> 02:03:55,604
Twice.
Nothing.

2771
02:03:56,670 --> 02:03:57,503
Right.
I mean he took them down the first 

2772
02:03:59,390 --> 02:04:02,070
thought that was possible.
Strong.

2773
02:04:02,120 --> 02:04:03,310
He is.
He's very good.

2774
02:04:03,350 --> 02:04:06,370
Frank meir said he's like wrestling with
jon jones.

2775
02:04:06,560 --> 02:04:08,240
Nobody realizes that.
Strong and sorted,

2776
02:04:08,300 --> 02:04:09,890
sorted a good assuming stronger.

2777
02:04:09,890 --> 02:04:11,600
NoW.
He's so crazy strong.

2778
02:04:11,690 --> 02:04:13,070
I don't know if it's leveraged,
but uh,

2779
02:04:13,280 --> 02:04:17,220
it's all the above is also a juco.
National champ.

2780
02:04:17,320 --> 02:04:19,850
He's a nightmare.
Cradle.

2781
02:04:19,851 --> 02:04:21,830
Ryan bader didn't cradle him.
Was,

2782
02:04:21,831 --> 02:04:22,664
it was a battery.
Did that too where he just put him in a 

2783
02:04:24,261 --> 02:04:26,780
cradle and just the show run.
I mean,

2784
02:04:26,810 --> 02:04:29,630
he literally didn't watch it other way.
Rumbled did.

2785
02:04:29,930 --> 02:04:31,940
That was horrifying.
Yeah.

2786
02:04:32,150 --> 02:04:33,050
Rumbles.
terrifying.

2787
02:04:33,260 --> 02:04:35,240
He scared me more than I want to see 
rumble fight.

2788
02:04:36,040 --> 02:04:36,873
Jon jones.
It's whether or not rumble can continue 

2789
02:04:39,541 --> 02:04:40,374
that sort of.
You don't think jan's takes him down 

2790
02:04:41,700 --> 02:04:43,260
deep into the second,
third floor.

2791
02:04:43,350 --> 02:04:45,150
People are going to figure it out.
They already have figured it out.

2792
02:04:45,310 --> 02:04:46,440
Yeah.
Daniel,

2793
02:04:46,441 --> 02:04:48,060
did you drag on the later,
right?

2794
02:04:48,061 --> 02:04:50,010
You avoid The big punch dragon in the 
later rounds.

2795
02:04:50,230 --> 02:04:53,610
John's change.
Can a guy like him?

2796
02:04:53,790 --> 02:04:55,380
Can a guy like rumble change?

2797
02:04:55,380 --> 02:04:58,980
She's obviously changed and gotten way 
better in the avoiding the weight cut.

2798
02:04:59,040 --> 02:05:00,660
Becoming a real natural two.
Oh,

2799
02:05:00,661 --> 02:05:01,494
five pounder.
Kenny change in far as like not being 

2800
02:05:04,531 --> 02:05:08,040
able to be broken the way dc broke up 
with josh koscheck.

2801
02:05:08,940 --> 02:05:10,170
Vito belfort,
broken.

2802
02:05:10,410 --> 02:05:13,020
I don't think you're born with it.
It's a part of your personality,

2803
02:05:13,350 --> 02:05:16,110
so whether whether or not you allow your
mind to go down,

2804
02:05:16,111 --> 02:05:18,750
those psychologists can probably help 
you disagree.

2805
02:05:18,751 --> 02:05:19,830
Maybe.
Maybe.

2806
02:05:20,040 --> 02:05:21,720
Is iT possible?
I don't think so.

2807
02:05:21,810 --> 02:05:24,030
are there examples,
but the whole lot it's like,

2808
02:05:24,070 --> 02:05:25,740
ooh,
who's been broke?

2809
02:05:25,770 --> 02:05:29,310
But how can you say it's not possible 
because it's mental.

2810
02:05:29,311 --> 02:05:30,144
If it's mental,
it's most certainly don't tHink it's a 

2811
02:05:31,651 --> 02:05:34,920
personality trait.
It's not possible for me to win the high

2812
02:05:34,921 --> 02:05:38,520
jump.
I don't have it physically right now.

2813
02:05:38,521 --> 02:05:40,920
Let's say for him,
for him though,

2814
02:05:40,980 --> 02:05:42,780
it's.
It's a mind issue,

2815
02:05:42,930 --> 02:05:43,500
but why?

2816
02:05:43,500 --> 02:05:46,590
Why couldn't a man adjust the way he 
looks at the world?

2817
02:05:46,860 --> 02:05:51,120
Isn't it possible that you could,
through a rigorous disciplined,

2818
02:05:51,540 --> 02:05:52,373
like very focused attempt to change the 
way you approach various scenarios and 

2819
02:05:57,361 --> 02:05:58,194
dilemmas?
Isn't it possible that you could change 

2820
02:06:00,211 --> 02:06:01,044
your thinking and wouldn't that be more 
likely that you could become more 

2821
02:06:03,511 --> 02:06:07,440
mentally tough than it would be that 
you'd be like this physical free because

2822
02:06:07,441 --> 02:06:11,430
it's a physical thing in cardio makes 
brings out the weakness in people,

2823
02:06:11,431 --> 02:06:12,264
so what are you going to do?
You can put them through these crazy 

2824
02:06:13,771 --> 02:06:15,930
cardio challenges and have a mental 
coach there.

2825
02:06:16,110 --> 02:06:17,910
Now here's The point where usually 
break.

2826
02:06:17,940 --> 02:06:19,550
Let's keep going.
Here's what I say.

2827
02:06:19,580 --> 02:06:20,413
First of all,
I don't know nearly enough grappling 

2828
02:06:21,871 --> 02:06:24,120
before,
I think that was a big part of the issUe

2829
02:06:24,450 --> 02:06:25,283
was he was getting mad dogged by a guy 
who was an olympic caliber wrestler and 

2830
02:06:29,161 --> 02:06:30,720
daniel cormier was just ragging him all.

2831
02:06:30,730 --> 02:06:32,070
I know he did.
I bet he did.

2832
02:06:32,071 --> 02:06:33,550
Crazy.
No,

2833
02:06:33,610 --> 02:06:34,650
he didn't.
I know he didn't.

2834
02:06:35,250 --> 02:06:39,870
Now he's gotten near atlanta.
Who's a FuCking giant neon millennia.

2835
02:06:39,871 --> 02:06:44,370
Best fans in the world,
rapper might be the best deep,

2836
02:06:44,430 --> 02:06:47,790
deep knowledge of submissions,
but also a lot of catch.

2837
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:48,833
He's really.
He's very knowledgeable about catch 

2838
02:06:50,160 --> 02:06:54,240
wrestling and jujitsu also understands 
big man jujitsu.

2839
02:06:54,270 --> 02:06:56,840
He's a big motherfucker and if you're 
rolling with that guy,

2840
02:06:56,880 --> 02:06:58,490
guarantee you spending some time on your
back.

2841
02:06:58,491 --> 02:06:59,324
If randy couture's black belt,
he's randy couture's cop forever neoma 

2842
02:07:02,450 --> 02:07:04,560
lance and he's a stud.
This is a fucking crazy.

2843
02:07:04,561 --> 02:07:07,140
No mylanta and ready for this nigga 
lance and had a broken toe.

2844
02:07:07,141 --> 02:07:07,651
They said,
neil,

2845
02:07:07,651 --> 02:07:09,330
you're going to have to be off the mats 
for six months.

2846
02:07:09,331 --> 02:07:10,290
He goes,
cut it off.

2847
02:07:11,370 --> 02:07:12,990
The ronnie lott.
Lots of that.

2848
02:07:13,170 --> 02:07:14,003
Yeah,
he had his toe cut off so he could keep 

2849
02:07:16,861 --> 02:07:19,560
rolling.
Come on,

2850
02:07:19,561 --> 02:07:20,394
son.
I going to go into that terrible mental 

2851
02:07:22,771 --> 02:07:23,604
fortitude ahead.
Going back to the mental thing with a 

2852
02:07:26,131 --> 02:07:27,120
mental coach,
man.

2853
02:07:27,121 --> 02:07:30,720
I think sometimes there's just.
I don't know,

2854
02:07:30,721 --> 02:07:31,610
man.
I think some people,

2855
02:07:31,611 --> 02:07:34,650
it's just in their dna.
They just break easier now when she gets

2856
02:07:34,651 --> 02:07:36,190
a dna,
what I think

2857
02:07:36,190 --> 02:07:38,320
it is is it being a big,
strong,

2858
02:07:38,350 --> 02:07:42,040
tough guy and being used to being the 
hammer and then when you're the nail you

2859
02:07:42,041 --> 02:07:44,280
can't handle it and you fall apart 
because it's an n.

2860
02:07:44,380 --> 02:07:47,680
You're uncovering your unaccustomed to 
it rather than a guy like,

2861
02:07:48,250 --> 02:07:50,170
here's a good example,
darren elkins,

2862
02:07:50,440 --> 02:07:51,273
you can hit that motherfucker with a 
baseball bat and he keeps coming 

2863
02:07:52,871 --> 02:07:54,170
forward.
He's used to getting beat on.

2864
02:07:54,220 --> 02:07:55,780
He's not a big guy.
He's a tough guy.

2865
02:07:55,810 --> 02:08:00,070
John jones isn't the only had him with 
jon jones is a fairly trained,

2866
02:08:00,160 --> 02:08:00,993
was getting beat up.
John jones has two big brothers and his 

2867
02:08:03,911 --> 02:08:04,744
bigger brother beat his ass all through 
his life and I think he's accustomed to 

2868
02:08:06,911 --> 02:08:10,270
getting his ass beat by his big brother.
I think his brother arthur didn't have a

2869
02:08:10,271 --> 02:08:13,840
fantastic service and being bigger and 
kicking his ass for sure,

2870
02:08:14,040 --> 02:08:16,570
but I think it goes in two ways.

2871
02:08:16,840 --> 02:08:18,430
Either you're born with it,
like you said,

2872
02:08:18,580 --> 02:08:23,580
or some traumatic event in your life 
that maybe it's has something to do with

2873
02:08:24,980 --> 02:08:25,840
it.
Maybe it doesn't,

2874
02:08:26,320 --> 02:08:29,200
but it switches on that quit and you're 
in your in your mind and your body.

2875
02:08:29,530 --> 02:08:31,540
Some of it's just mental.
Some of it's physical.

2876
02:08:31,541 --> 02:08:33,580
Your body gives out or your brain gives 
out.

2877
02:08:34,090 --> 02:08:35,890
I think there's multiple ways to look at
it.

2878
02:08:35,891 --> 02:08:39,790
Obviously vinny shoreman could fix him.
Finished romans a hitman chest.

2879
02:08:39,820 --> 02:08:41,870
Shout out tonight.
My mind coach vinny.

2880
02:08:43,090 --> 02:08:44,620
That's what he calls himself.
My approach.

2881
02:08:44,830 --> 02:08:45,663
It's.
I think it can definitely be a learned 

2882
02:08:47,801 --> 02:08:48,634
behavior to to quit.
Whether it's you got taught that or you 

2883
02:08:52,511 --> 02:08:55,730
got that imposed on you or someone made 
you break when you.

2884
02:08:56,200 --> 02:08:59,530
It's a habit that there's just a little,
a lot of ways to go about it,

2885
02:08:59,531 --> 02:09:01,690
you know,
not saying something bad happened in his

2886
02:09:01,691 --> 02:09:02,050
life.

2887
02:09:02,050 --> 02:09:03,520
Maybe it was something good that made 
him say,

2888
02:09:03,521 --> 02:09:04,211
well,
fuck this.

2889
02:09:04,211 --> 02:09:08,080
I'm out.
I don't think at his level he's gotten a

2890
02:09:08,430 --> 02:09:09,263
coach.
You don't think he's ever talked to 

2891
02:09:10,160 --> 02:09:10,993
them.
There's a lot of fighters that have 

2892
02:09:11,741 --> 02:09:12,574
never gotten a mental coach.
Like I asked cowboy about it and he's 

2893
02:09:14,231 --> 02:09:15,130
like,
shit,

2894
02:09:15,490 --> 02:09:19,190
I can't put laughed in my face.
Well,

2895
02:09:19,210 --> 02:09:21,130
kevin has never had a fucking mental 
coach.

2896
02:09:21,380 --> 02:09:24,820
Tazzy do you think cowboys at a mental 
coach?

2897
02:09:24,910 --> 02:09:26,290
I don'T know why you're making that 
face.

2898
02:09:27,070 --> 02:09:28,300
you think he's a liar?
No.

2899
02:09:28,390 --> 02:09:29,440
How dare you?
Ian,

2900
02:09:29,441 --> 02:09:30,274
what?
What do you when you're kind of one 

2901
02:09:32,380 --> 02:09:35,230
against the ropes here.
Why don't you talk to yourself?

2902
02:09:35,231 --> 02:09:37,380
Like what do you do?
I'm my worst on my,

2903
02:09:37,410 --> 02:09:42,340
my own worst enemy,
so I just fucking talk shit to myself or

2904
02:09:42,341 --> 02:09:43,860
it depends.
Sometimes I'm going in,

2905
02:09:43,870 --> 02:09:45,970
I feel great and some days I just sit 
there and I'm like,

2906
02:09:45,971 --> 02:09:46,900
wow,
I'm fucked.

2907
02:09:47,380 --> 02:09:51,850
Like going out for my last fight,
sitting there backstage and just slumped

2908
02:09:51,851 --> 02:09:52,900
in the chair.
Why?

2909
02:09:53,460 --> 02:09:54,293
I don't know.
This was after working with vinny 

2910
02:09:55,331 --> 02:09:56,131
though?
No,

2911
02:09:56,131 --> 02:09:56,380
no,
no.

2912
02:09:56,380 --> 02:09:58,950
I started working with any after this 
and you know,

2913
02:09:58,951 --> 02:10:02,180
a personal problems with me.
It's always like women problems.

2914
02:10:02,500 --> 02:10:05,560
She's in monday,
dear you little girl effect your.

2915
02:10:06,660 --> 02:10:08,770
Hey,
let me ask you this before.

2916
02:10:08,771 --> 02:10:10,080
It's not gonna,
it's gonna happen again.

2917
02:10:11,230 --> 02:10:15,520
I say this the same as any other job and
I'm sure with stand up some nights and I

2918
02:10:15,521 --> 02:10:17,290
felt this way,
there's probably three fights,

2919
02:10:17,500 --> 02:10:19,270
man.
Any other night I'm down.

2920
02:10:19,690 --> 02:10:22,690
I jUst don't Feel like fuCking fighting 
tonight for whatever reason.

2921
02:10:22,691 --> 02:10:24,070
I just don't feel like it.
Well,

2922
02:10:24,071 --> 02:10:26,800
standup is way more relaxed.
I know.

2923
02:10:26,801 --> 02:10:28,690
I'm just saying for your job.
Yeah,

2924
02:10:28,691 --> 02:10:29,524
sure.
There's nights when you're performing 

2925
02:10:30,221 --> 02:10:31,210
for the thousands of people,
you're like,

2926
02:10:31,450 --> 02:10:32,970
Damn,
I really don't feel like doing it.

2927
02:10:33,070 --> 02:10:34,130
It's usually the same thing.

2928
02:10:34,130 --> 02:10:34,963
It's usually a girl thing,
like you get in a fight with your 

2929
02:10:36,921 --> 02:10:39,070
girlfriend or Something like that and 
you go out there.

2930
02:10:39,100 --> 02:10:42,470
You just don't feel funny.
I fuck up when I have an acting job.

2931
02:10:42,500 --> 02:10:44,690
This is gonna sound crazy,
but sometimes when you have an audition,

2932
02:10:44,720 --> 02:10:47,840
I think about this and it's three pages.
It's just three pages.

2933
02:10:48,080 --> 02:10:50,240
You can do it in your sleep.
Guess what?

2934
02:10:50,570 --> 02:10:52,130
It's the.
It's the network tests.

2935
02:10:52,131 --> 02:10:52,964
You go in there.
There are probably 15 people show tell 

2936
02:10:55,460 --> 02:10:57,770
you have to do is Just do three pages.
I've gotten myself.

2937
02:10:57,771 --> 02:10:59,490
There is between Me and another guy,
right.

2938
02:10:59,660 --> 02:11:02,480
If I get it,
I will make a million dollars.

2939
02:11:02,630 --> 02:11:03,463
I will make $1,000,000
for the year and I won't have to work 

2940
02:11:05,211 --> 02:11:06,290
for it.
It's a sitcom.

2941
02:11:06,320 --> 02:11:09,200
I'll make a million dollars.
Just do what you did.

2942
02:11:09,620 --> 02:11:12,650
Just do three pages.
It's no big deal.

2943
02:11:12,670 --> 02:11:13,970
It's like,
don't miss that putt.

2944
02:11:14,450 --> 02:11:16,640
That's when I get nervous.
That's when I fucked myself.

2945
02:11:16,860 --> 02:11:19,410
See I went,
when I went out for news radio,

2946
02:11:20,060 --> 02:11:22,820
there was two auditions for news radio.
One was a cattle call.

2947
02:11:22,840 --> 02:11:24,960
It was like 100 people's giant long 
line.

2948
02:11:24,961 --> 02:11:25,794
It was like,
and I had a development deal with nbc 

2949
02:11:27,651 --> 02:11:28,484
and I,
I just didn't know that I was going to 

2950
02:11:29,331 --> 02:11:31,280
be a part of a cattle calls.
Like this is crazy.

2951
02:11:31,550 --> 02:11:34,190
And I went in and the script was not 
funny,

2952
02:11:34,520 --> 02:11:35,353
like on purpose.
They had decided to write it where they 

2953
02:11:37,470 --> 02:11:42,050
will weed out all the hams.
They didn't want anybody to read it.

2954
02:11:42,090 --> 02:11:42,923
Like,
like what am I supposed to weed out all 

2955
02:11:49,461 --> 02:11:51,080
that shit.
So I went in,

2956
02:11:51,081 --> 02:11:55,250
I read it and I remember talking to my 
manager.

2957
02:11:55,251 --> 02:11:56,084
He was like,
how'd it go?

2958
02:11:56,400 --> 02:11:57,530
Script wasn't funny.
I mean,

2959
02:11:57,531 --> 02:11:59,900
I just pretended it was really 
happening.

2960
02:11:59,930 --> 02:12:00,763
that's all I did.
I just did it like it was really 

2961
02:12:01,611 --> 02:12:02,444
happening and so then there was only 
like a few people that apparently made 

2962
02:12:06,111 --> 02:12:09,320
the cut and then I went in there for the
second audition.

2963
02:12:09,500 --> 02:12:10,333
It was Me and three other dudes who 
looked like they were about to fucking 

2964
02:12:13,760 --> 02:12:14,593
ship off to Vietnam.
They were sweating and they were pale 

2965
02:12:18,170 --> 02:12:21,410
and you know,
I was 26 at the time so it was only like

2966
02:12:21,411 --> 02:12:24,020
four years removed from my last fight or
something like that.

2967
02:12:24,620 --> 02:12:25,453
And I looked at all these guys all 
nervous and sweaty and I sat on the 

2968
02:12:28,461 --> 02:12:33,290
couch and I put my feet up and I didn't 
even read the script.

2969
02:12:33,770 --> 02:12:36,800
I just sat back and I did it like in 
front of them.

2970
02:12:36,830 --> 02:12:39,890
What's up bitch?
You fucking pussies.

2971
02:12:40,040 --> 02:12:40,873
You guys don't know how to perform under
pressure because this is going to be 

2972
02:12:42,771 --> 02:12:45,980
great mind that I sat there and I like 
looked at the script a little bit.

2973
02:12:45,980 --> 02:12:48,920
I'm like this.
And it was and it was funny.

2974
02:12:48,921 --> 02:12:52,310
That's the way tO do it.
And I had prepared so I knew that it was

2975
02:12:52,311 --> 02:12:53,360
funny,
so I was,

2976
02:12:53,361 --> 02:12:54,194
I was reaDy.
But when I saw these guys all sweaty is 

2977
02:12:56,331 --> 02:12:56,901
like,
there's three,

2978
02:12:56,901 --> 02:12:57,734
three or four guyS thing.
But they looked like they were just 

2979
02:12:59,301 --> 02:13:03,370
fucking terrified.
I'll give you one guy was doing it.

2980
02:13:03,390 --> 02:13:04,140
He was like,
whoa,

2981
02:13:04,140 --> 02:13:04,840
whoa,
whoa,

2982
02:13:04,840 --> 02:13:05,673
whoa,
whoa,

2983
02:13:05,880 --> 02:13:06,230
whoa,
whoa.

2984
02:13:06,230 --> 02:13:09,930
He was practicing by himself.
Like that bitch ain't get it.

2985
02:13:09,980 --> 02:13:10,813
Looked at.
The other guy looked like he was about 

2986
02:13:12,591 --> 02:13:16,040
to get shot.
The they look like they're about to die.

2987
02:13:16,440 --> 02:13:17,273
And so that alone gave me massive 
confidence and I went in there super 

2988
02:13:21,591 --> 02:13:23,530
loose,
super loose and relaxed.

2989
02:13:23,590 --> 02:13:25,580
I'm like,
if it's between me and these pussies,

2990
02:13:25,850 --> 02:13:26,451
I'm like,
I got it.

2991
02:13:26,451 --> 02:13:27,570
For sure.
Yeah.

2992
02:13:27,660 --> 02:13:29,960
And they can sense that constantly to,
well,

2993
02:13:30,210 --> 02:13:31,980
yeah,
I did it on purpose

2994
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:32,813
for the guy.
So it's like I was competing against 

2995
02:13:33,691 --> 02:13:34,441
these guys.
I was like,

2996
02:13:34,441 --> 02:13:35,121
I'm going to be,
fuck.

2997
02:13:35,121 --> 02:13:37,320
Yeah,
that's what I never get.

2998
02:13:37,321 --> 02:13:38,154
I don't get nervous by nature.
I don't get nervous when I have to 

2999
02:13:40,411 --> 02:13:44,190
perform ever.
And that's the only time because my mind

3000
02:13:44,191 --> 02:13:45,024
is telling myself,
it's so ridiculous to be nervous that 

3001
02:13:47,071 --> 02:13:50,760
I'm literally sabotaging myself where I 
was nervous.

3002
02:13:50,880 --> 02:13:55,050
It's not ridiculous that you care and 
you will not do the wrong thing.

3003
02:13:55,440 --> 02:13:57,980
The wrong thing about money.
You're not being in the moment.

3004
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,540
You the consequences.
They can't do that.

3005
02:14:00,541 --> 02:14:03,990
You're doing it for the wrong reason.
Then if you don't want to act,

3006
02:14:04,050 --> 02:14:05,460
I've never been.
You shouldn't be.

3007
02:14:05,480 --> 02:14:06,313
There might be like god the money I'm 
going to make or if I wouldn't say I've 

3008
02:14:10,021 --> 02:14:12,810
never once ever in my life thought,
but I think it's because I'm lying.

3009
02:14:13,470 --> 02:14:15,600
I'm lying to myself when I go into 
vision,

3010
02:14:15,850 --> 02:14:19,830
like I can go and I get it.
I go all the way and then I get in there

3011
02:14:19,831 --> 02:14:20,664
and now it's just do this.
And I think it's because I'm being a 

3012
02:14:23,431 --> 02:14:24,940
liar.
I think I'll be,

3013
02:14:25,880 --> 02:14:27,600
I don't want to be there,
right?

3014
02:14:27,601 --> 02:14:29,820
Because I've never done it.
I didn't want it to.

3015
02:14:30,090 --> 02:14:30,923
Well.
So with the exception of one point in 

3016
02:14:33,480 --> 02:14:35,850
time,
there was doing it at one point in time.

3017
02:14:35,880 --> 02:14:39,330
You deeply wanted to be on a sitcom like
you did.

3018
02:14:39,360 --> 02:14:40,193
It was all you wanted to do.
You weren't even doing standup for part 

3019
02:14:43,690 --> 02:14:45,600
thing a lot.
I was doing a lot of plays.

3020
02:14:45,601 --> 02:14:48,600
I was doing a lot who are pretending to 
be an actor.

3021
02:14:48,601 --> 02:14:52,140
It was just like you would talk like one
of them.

3022
02:14:52,141 --> 02:14:52,974
You don't that a little bit.
You're relaxed when he's around 

3023
02:14:58,921 --> 02:14:59,930
executives like it was.

3024
02:14:59,930 --> 02:15:01,500
It was talking about a woman,
you know,

3025
02:15:01,501 --> 02:15:02,310
like anytime.
Oh,

3026
02:15:02,310 --> 02:15:03,143
someone to bring up a woman.
He would immediately be like super 

3027
02:15:05,130 --> 02:15:08,130
progressive and overemphasize how good 
he could.

3028
02:15:08,131 --> 02:15:09,780
She is.
she's amazing.

3029
02:15:10,620 --> 02:15:12,990
She's amazing and I feel like what she's
like,

3030
02:15:13,110 --> 02:15:13,943
good.
We're talking about a female comedian 

3031
02:15:17,520 --> 02:15:19,380
when you guys were friends from the 
jump.

3032
02:15:19,680 --> 02:15:21,690
That's what friends are for right off 
the bat,

3033
02:15:24,030 --> 02:15:26,380
because we never bullshit each other.
I mean we.

3034
02:15:26,580 --> 02:15:29,220
There was no like a.
I wasn't pulling the wool over his eyes.

3035
02:15:29,250 --> 02:15:30,830
Oh my god.
Well he was on the,

3036
02:15:30,990 --> 02:15:34,170
in the worst environment.
The worst environment in my opinion,

3037
02:15:34,260 --> 02:15:38,000
is those sketch shows because everybody 
is scrambling and being completed.

3038
02:15:38,020 --> 02:15:40,300
I did to get and he was the only one 
that was cool.

3039
02:15:40,450 --> 02:15:41,283
Him and already already was cool as fuck
already lying and it was him and artie 

3040
02:15:44,571 --> 02:15:45,404
lange.
We're the only ones and me and already 

3041
02:15:45,961 --> 02:15:48,000
had a scene together and I had a scene 
with brian,

3042
02:15:48,270 --> 02:15:49,103
but then there was all these other 
people that were on the set that were 

3043
02:15:50,761 --> 02:15:51,470
brutal.

3044
02:15:51,470 --> 02:15:53,360
Says mad tv.
Oh my god.

3045
02:15:53,530 --> 02:15:57,100
I guess he was our guests.
They weren't mean to me.

3046
02:15:57,120 --> 02:15:58,510
No,
everybody was fine with that.

3047
02:15:58,810 --> 02:16:00,140
If you look back at those videos,
you get.

3048
02:16:00,360 --> 02:16:02,640
I think I sent you the picture.
you guys are so young.

3049
02:16:03,120 --> 02:16:06,750
I couldn't believe it was joe since I 
was 27.

3050
02:16:06,751 --> 02:16:09,480
So funny.
Look at my hair.

3051
02:16:09,481 --> 02:16:10,650
It's so beautiful.
I miss it.

3052
02:16:12,110 --> 02:16:15,840
I miss it so much at.
That chick was really funny,

3053
02:16:15,841 --> 02:16:16,800
man.
What was her name?

3054
02:16:16,870 --> 02:16:17,703
That's mary's great.
Mary's shear and who to this day is the 

3055
02:16:21,391 --> 02:16:22,224
funniest female actor.
probably most talented person I've ever 

3056
02:16:25,171 --> 02:16:29,230
worked with so far enough back then.
I have a beautiful body.

3057
02:16:29,231 --> 02:16:31,270
I'm going to take my shirt off after 
this boy.

3058
02:16:31,300 --> 02:16:33,730
He had this great character that would 
dance around.

3059
02:16:33,731 --> 02:16:35,650
Was that a wig you were wearing or was 
bleach.

3060
02:16:35,651 --> 02:16:36,484
Okay.
that was awake.

3061
02:16:36,490 --> 02:16:39,400
High speed.
I got a lot of gay fan mail and a lot of

3062
02:16:39,660 --> 02:16:40,493
fan mail deal and I'm not kidding.
You still have the letters I got from 

3063
02:16:43,330 --> 02:16:46,000
jail.
That woman,

3064
02:16:46,830 --> 02:16:50,050
she.
She still weird like leather skin makeup

3065
02:16:50,320 --> 02:16:51,153
to make herself look like she was 
overtanned and she had this crazy 

3066
02:16:53,381 --> 02:16:54,214
character.
Jennifer aspinall who is a multimedia 

3067
02:16:56,470 --> 02:17:00,340
award winning makeup artist and she did 
like magical shit.

3068
02:17:00,370 --> 02:17:03,340
Joe,
when did you decide acting?

3069
02:17:03,400 --> 02:17:04,810
Just acting.
Well,

3070
02:17:04,811 --> 02:17:05,480
I really love it.

3071
02:17:05,480 --> 02:17:10,480
News radio and I'd love to because it 
was just the best case scenario.

3072
02:17:10,850 --> 02:17:14,810
Fantastic writing,
great talented actors,

3073
02:17:14,840 --> 02:17:15,673
you know,
all of the above was and it never was 

3074
02:17:17,061 --> 02:17:17,894
successful,
which is perfect because everybody had 

3075
02:17:19,161 --> 02:17:20,900
to keep trying and nobody ever got a big
head.

3076
02:17:21,410 --> 02:17:22,860
It just.
It never made it.

3077
02:17:22,910 --> 02:17:23,743
You know,
it barely putt putt putt barely stayed 

3078
02:17:25,431 --> 02:17:26,264
alive.
It was a perfect environment like with 

3079
02:17:28,220 --> 02:17:31,700
some really talented people.
Still one of the greatest sitcoms ever.

3080
02:17:31,740 --> 02:17:35,090
And you enjoyed the whole process?
Like I didn't enjoy as much as I enjoyed

3081
02:17:35,091 --> 02:17:35,924
standup,
but I enjoyed it immensely and way more 

3082
02:17:37,731 --> 02:17:42,340
than I enjoyed any other things.
After that I saw after that I,

3083
02:17:42,440 --> 02:17:46,370
I had development deals for like a year 
or two where I.

3084
02:17:46,640 --> 02:17:49,110
Which means what?
They give you some money and they try to

3085
02:17:49,111 --> 02:17:52,610
put together a sitcom and it's based 
around you.

3086
02:17:52,611 --> 02:17:54,980
And tHen I got a chance to see what it's
like.

3087
02:17:54,980 --> 02:17:55,813
And just actors are like the worst 
comedians without punchlines like the 

3088
02:18:01,581 --> 02:18:03,440
worst comedians,
meaning not like the worst,

3089
02:18:03,441 --> 02:18:06,950
like not funny,
but mean the most crazy,

3090
02:18:07,340 --> 02:18:12,340
the most neurotic in the,
the actual act itself of auditioning and

3091
02:18:13,701 --> 02:18:16,730
trying to get gigs.
It enforces that it.

3092
02:18:16,970 --> 02:18:19,880
You're always trying to get people to 
love you.

3093
02:18:20,330 --> 02:18:23,480
You can always looking for approval,
but you can never just be,

3094
02:18:24,620 --> 02:18:25,453
be at peace.
You're always worried that you have to 

3095
02:18:28,671 --> 02:18:31,280
say the right thing.
You have to be liberal.

3096
02:18:31,490 --> 02:18:33,680
If you're not liberal,
if you are a republican,

3097
02:18:33,681 --> 02:18:37,110
you better be fucking uber successful 
before you come out as worD.

3098
02:18:37,450 --> 02:18:38,960
Yeah.
You have to be.

3099
02:18:39,200 --> 02:18:42,680
You have to say those things like you 
have to be super progressive,

3100
02:18:42,681 --> 02:18:46,070
you have to be super left wing and you 
also,

3101
02:18:46,080 --> 02:18:46,913
you gotta like you gotta like play this 
bullshit political game where 

3102
02:18:50,451 --> 02:18:51,284
everybody's fake.
they're all saying fake things and just 

3103
02:18:54,230 --> 02:18:56,840
it feels so gross and coming from 
comedy,

3104
02:18:56,841 --> 02:19:01,841
from the east coast doing standup from 
going from fighting and then stand up to

3105
02:19:02,181 --> 02:19:03,014
this,

3106
02:19:05,370 --> 02:19:09,200
I can't see you for five years.
I get my throat gets tight when we start

3107
02:19:09,201 --> 02:19:10,034
talking about because it's all like 
nothing Drives me more nuts when guys 

3108
02:19:14,350 --> 02:19:15,870
pose it,
especially if they're not fighters.

3109
02:19:15,880 --> 02:19:17,020
There are fighters.
I get it.

3110
02:19:17,021 --> 02:19:17,854
It's the thing,
but when they put their fist up for a 

3111
02:19:19,071 --> 02:19:20,660
picture,
I told brian,

3112
02:19:20,661 --> 02:19:21,980
I go,
fuck is this,

3113
02:19:21,981 --> 02:19:22,814
and we bought those guy.
It's a picture of him and his friend 

3114
02:19:25,730 --> 02:19:26,620
with their fists up.
I go,

3115
02:19:26,930 --> 02:19:29,140
why the fuck do people do this?
Why do they.

3116
02:19:29,480 --> 02:19:32,940
What is this?
You will never see me put my fist up in.

3117
02:19:32,990 --> 02:19:34,640
I never do it.
It's a tool.

3118
02:19:34,740 --> 02:19:36,530
It's such.
It's so weird to me.

3119
02:19:36,940 --> 02:19:40,130
People have asked me to do it with them.
He put your postdoc for this picture.

3120
02:19:40,131 --> 02:19:40,911
I go,
no,

3121
02:19:40,911 --> 02:19:41,744
can't do it.
I always want to square off with me and 

3122
02:19:43,731 --> 02:19:44,564
fucking atlanta.

3123
02:19:44,640 --> 02:19:45,470
No,
no.

3124
02:19:45,470 --> 02:19:47,990
Come on the face.
but you'll see like big dudes.

3125
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:48,833
I'm not gonna say who the guy is,
but he's a big guy in the pictures on 

3126
02:19:50,901 --> 02:19:52,340
instagram is like,
look,

3127
02:19:52,850 --> 02:19:54,440
I told brian like,
why the fuck you think he does?

3128
02:19:54,441 --> 02:19:56,960
I guess because he's not really tough.
It's like an ego thing,

3129
02:19:57,110 --> 02:19:59,180
you know,
while there's also like a culture thing,

3130
02:19:59,181 --> 02:20:00,980
they think that it's a cool way to 
stand.

3131
02:20:00,981 --> 02:20:02,120
I don't know.
It's like doing this,

3132
02:20:02,121 --> 02:20:03,710
doing the shaka like,
oh,

3133
02:20:03,810 --> 02:20:04,643
I take the shot that I'm saying.
It's like that's one of those things 

3134
02:20:08,970 --> 02:20:11,170
what you're saying,
like other people doing the shaka shaka,

3135
02:20:11,330 --> 02:20:13,280
it's like the will ferrell thing and 
talladega nights.

3136
02:20:13,281 --> 02:20:16,820
I don't know what to do and with whom.
So it's covering his face.

3137
02:20:17,240 --> 02:20:20,310
Just first intErview.
Fucking love it.

3138
02:20:21,090 --> 02:20:22,910
I love that movie.
Fuck yeah,

3139
02:20:22,911 --> 02:20:25,010
I love that movie.
Tom cruise.

3140
02:20:25,011 --> 02:20:26,030
Use your witchcraft.

3141
02:20:29,880 --> 02:20:32,660
I like that they put the v retinas face 
tune is running around.

3142
02:20:33,590 --> 02:20:37,160
I love how his buddies in his house and 
he can't figure out how to work a system

3143
02:20:37,161 --> 02:20:39,550
because his buddies banging his wife now
and welfare.

3144
02:20:40,320 --> 02:20:41,160
He calls me,
oh,

3145
02:20:42,140 --> 02:20:45,680
how do you turn on the radio,
the radio and the tv at the same time,

3146
02:20:45,710 --> 02:20:46,543
because I like to party his house and he
fucking cut out his picture and put his 

3147
02:20:50,241 --> 02:20:55,241
head on the picture.
I've already paralyzed like,

3148
02:20:55,690 --> 02:20:56,523
you're not paralyzed in the hospital.
I stab a knife in his fucking 

3149
02:21:01,970 --> 02:21:05,740
stepbrothers man.
He's so amazing.

3150
02:21:05,750 --> 02:21:09,360
Like welfare all.
It's just his ability and nobody.

3151
02:21:09,440 --> 02:21:13,370
Nobody has a bad thing to say about him.
Will a great guy,

3152
02:21:13,371 --> 02:21:14,610
great guy.
He's a great guy.

3153
02:21:14,660 --> 02:21:16,720
Had enough to have friends who played 
golf with them.

3154
02:21:16,740 --> 02:21:17,420
They were like,
yeah,

3155
02:21:17,420 --> 02:21:19,970
he's a competitive guy.
He's not letting you win.

3156
02:21:20,480 --> 02:21:22,260
Yeah.
That was such a great moment.

3157
02:21:22,261 --> 02:21:24,590
His eyes look at his eyes and the 
intensity.

3158
02:21:24,840 --> 02:21:26,330
Just girl,
leslie bibb.

3159
02:21:26,331 --> 02:21:27,640
That was in that movie.
She's great.

3160
02:21:27,641 --> 02:21:28,474
I did zookeeper with her.
She played my girlfriend and then 

3161
02:21:29,711 --> 02:21:30,544
movies.
You keep her and there's a movie that I 

3162
02:21:31,521 --> 02:21:33,840
did,
but I only did because Kevin James,

3163
02:21:33,860 --> 02:21:35,310
my buddy as well.
I do it.

3164
02:21:35,510 --> 02:21:38,980
I didn't have to audition.
Just asked me if you're not,

3165
02:21:39,500 --> 02:21:42,080
you're acting but you're not.
You're not like a character.

3166
02:21:42,170 --> 02:21:43,370
Yeah.
That's the other one.

3167
02:21:43,371 --> 02:21:44,750
Here comes the boom.
I played myself.

3168
02:21:44,751 --> 02:21:45,584
That's right.
That was when he was going to be an mma 

3169
02:21:46,911 --> 02:21:49,280
fighter,
but I only have like a couple scenes and

3170
02:21:49,281 --> 02:21:51,380
there's a bunch of kids in mayhem.
Miller.

3171
02:21:51,520 --> 02:21:54,530
Yep.
Route and just a paycheck at that point.

3172
02:21:54,531 --> 02:21:57,320
Right when I was a buddy of mine asking 
me to do something,

3173
02:21:57,500 --> 02:21:59,980
but the zookeeper one was fun and I.

3174
02:22:00,050 --> 02:22:02,780
It was a kids' movie and I was like,
that'd be cool for my kids to see.

3175
02:22:03,050 --> 02:22:04,310
It's cool.
It's silly.

3176
02:22:04,670 --> 02:22:05,503
Bunch of monkeys talking to we.
Carol and I have been doing this thing 

3177
02:22:08,061 --> 02:22:12,590
with firing the kid for fox these 
episodes and to me acting is so.

3178
02:22:12,710 --> 02:22:15,140
I don't understand.
It's like music actors.

3179
02:22:15,141 --> 02:22:17,360
It's so mr.
Athletes or whatever,

3180
02:22:17,361 --> 02:22:18,230
man,
I don't give a fuck.

3181
02:22:18,231 --> 02:22:19,940
I get how they get their hard work 
talent,

3182
02:22:20,120 --> 02:22:23,000
but the act in to me is so.
IT's so different.

3183
02:22:23,001 --> 02:22:24,710
They're like,
aliens do a good job.

3184
02:22:24,711 --> 02:22:26,490
there are.
To me it's just.

3185
02:22:26,550 --> 02:22:27,383
It's a weird occupation.
It's very weird and people take it so 

3186
02:22:30,301 --> 02:22:33,780
god damn seriously and they think it's 
so special when people do so well.

3187
02:22:34,170 --> 02:22:35,003
You know,
chris rock had a great line that he was 

3188
02:22:35,821 --> 02:22:38,160
preparing before for.
He's doing the oscars.

3189
02:22:38,490 --> 02:22:40,050
He was like,
if you go to see the grammys,

3190
02:22:40,080 --> 02:22:42,600
they're singing,
you know the oscars.

3191
02:22:42,600 --> 02:22:44,300
they don't even act.
No one does anyThing.

3192
02:22:44,330 --> 02:22:45,680
Don't act,
don't do shit.

3193
02:22:45,681 --> 02:22:49,050
It's the most boring.
I've hosted it twice.

3194
02:22:49,051 --> 02:22:49,884
I don't know what the fuck's going on.
It's true how crunk or people that live 

3195
02:22:53,611 --> 02:22:55,500
in the category of one,
you probably don't even watch it,

3196
02:22:55,501 --> 02:22:59,070
but people are so crunk.
I this guy with $275 million.

3197
02:22:59,071 --> 02:23:02,790
One even cares and it's insane.
It's aN award.

3198
02:23:02,910 --> 02:23:07,020
It's an award for your make believe 
you're really gooD at make belief.

3199
02:23:07,130 --> 02:23:09,600
You guys gave to each other.
I just don't do it.

3200
02:23:09,610 --> 02:23:11,760
Don't care.
I like movies,

3201
02:23:12,120 --> 02:23:15,930
but the award shows to me are so 
nonsensical.

3202
02:23:16,110 --> 02:23:20,170
Whether it's award shows for comedy or 
award shows for music or what.

3203
02:23:20,550 --> 02:23:23,280
I don't fucking care.
It doesn't make any sense to me.

3204
02:23:25,270 --> 02:23:27,810
Here's the committee.
People like it.

3205
02:23:27,811 --> 02:23:30,090
Do they go to see your movie?
Do they enjoy it?

3206
02:23:30,150 --> 02:23:30,983
Then you win.
It's like this idea that there's one 

3207
02:23:33,061 --> 02:23:35,400
better movie than all the other movies 
is stupid.

3208
02:23:35,430 --> 02:23:38,040
That is weird because it's a human thing
to crown a champion.

3209
02:23:38,041 --> 02:23:40,250
Well,
how the fuck did x maki?

3210
02:23:40,260 --> 02:23:41,093
Not?
Not when.

3211
02:23:41,570 --> 02:23:43,380
I didn't have that.
Not when best movie.

3212
02:23:43,410 --> 02:23:45,840
I didn't say it overly reverent.
Yes.

3213
02:23:50,050 --> 02:23:55,050
I wasn't a speech impediment.
I was still a really good movie.

3214
02:23:55,380 --> 02:23:57,160
Yeah,
it was slow,

3215
02:23:57,161 --> 02:24:00,930
but it was amazing.
I never seen the revenant.

3216
02:24:00,931 --> 02:24:01,764
Didn't do it for me,
man.

3217
02:24:01,770 --> 02:24:04,920
The story wasn't invested in the 
character.

3218
02:24:04,921 --> 02:24:05,754
I didn't even care so I can't comment.
But the character mokena in the running 

3219
02:24:08,761 --> 02:24:13,380
for best movie now.
Then your thing is bullshit.

3220
02:24:15,950 --> 02:24:18,960
Bullshit is bullshit.
Madmax fucking cleaned up though.

3221
02:24:19,320 --> 02:24:21,360
mad madmax.
See thousand movie.

3222
02:24:21,361 --> 02:24:23,330
I thought it was pretty good.
It was all right.

3223
02:24:23,390 --> 02:24:26,160
It's so fun.
We make pretty unique though.

3224
02:24:26,310 --> 02:24:27,143
It was fun not really to remain.
I knew what was gonna happen and using 

3225
02:24:29,810 --> 02:24:30,643
this for five x market.
I did not know what the fuck was going 

3226
02:24:33,441 --> 02:24:34,274
to happen and I was wrong at the end,
tell me and I got a sex mock and I was 

3227
02:24:37,681 --> 02:24:38,970
like,
god damn great movie.

3228
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:40,980
They were nominated for a bunch of 
special effects of war.

3229
02:24:41,020 --> 02:24:42,540
I think.
Not not this oscar.

3230
02:24:42,570 --> 02:24:44,640
I think they won something.
Special effects.

3231
02:24:44,670 --> 02:24:48,410
did they did it when I didn't see a 
sniff of that movie.

3232
02:24:49,240 --> 02:24:51,440
I didn't takE that movie is not allowed 
with that.

3233
02:24:51,780 --> 02:24:52,950
Did you see it?
Have you seen it?

3234
02:24:52,951 --> 02:24:55,660
No,
goddamn man,

3235
02:24:56,030 --> 02:24:56,863
goddamn.
He can't get enough of and I highly 

3236
02:24:58,591 --> 02:25:01,920
doubt anyone here is watching.
WaS the oj simpson thing on ethics keeps

3237
02:25:01,921 --> 02:25:02,754
telling me that I suck too.
I was at the store the other night and 

3238
02:25:05,270 --> 02:25:06,103
they had it in the back comics bar.
They were watching it and Cuba gooding 

3239
02:25:08,851 --> 02:25:10,800
jr place oj,
which I did not know.

3240
02:25:10,950 --> 02:25:12,150
I was like,
dude,

3241
02:25:12,360 --> 02:25:15,360
johnnie cochran in that movie when a guy
gives a racist thing,

3242
02:25:15,820 --> 02:25:18,690
oscar win as a triumph.
Does it for low budget?

3243
02:25:19,950 --> 02:25:20,770
Well it should.
Uhm,

3244
02:25:20,770 --> 02:25:22,350
there you go.
It should have one for visual.

3245
02:25:22,351 --> 02:25:23,660
It's a goddamn this year.

3246
02:25:23,980 --> 02:25:25,460
fantastic.
Moving.

3247
02:25:25,490 --> 02:25:27,400
I'll watch it.
It's a fantastic movie.

3248
02:25:27,401 --> 02:25:29,800
It's one of my all time favorite movie.
Is it happened in space.

3249
02:25:29,870 --> 02:25:31,240
Oh no,
no,

3250
02:25:31,241 --> 02:25:31,631
no,
no,

3251
02:25:31,631 --> 02:25:32,320
no,
no,

3252
02:25:32,320 --> 02:25:33,760
no.
It's about artificial intelligence.

3253
02:25:33,940 --> 02:25:36,850
It's about a guY who builds artificial 
people.

3254
02:25:36,880 --> 02:25:40,670
It's fucking she ai with will smith.
Is tHat what it's called?

3255
02:25:40,910 --> 02:25:42,760
IT's not the same.
This robot.

3256
02:25:43,540 --> 02:25:44,590
That was good.
It was good.

3257
02:25:44,591 --> 02:25:45,820
That was good.
This is way better.

3258
02:25:45,850 --> 02:25:46,683
Really.
It's one of the best movies I've ever 

3259
02:25:47,471 --> 02:25:51,150
seen in my top 10 all time.
Favorite goddamn rogan.

3260
02:25:51,280 --> 02:25:52,110
One hundred percent.
Yeah.

3261
02:25:52,110 --> 02:25:55,930
It's right up there with apocalypse 
anatomy for real shit.

3262
02:25:55,931 --> 02:25:58,480
So it's a great way.
And it's also the implications.

3263
02:25:58,481 --> 02:26:00,910
People right now scream.
You're fucking twitter.

3264
02:26:00,911 --> 02:26:04,310
You fucking piece of shit.
It's opinions ladies and gentlemen.

3265
02:26:05,320 --> 02:26:07,090
That's what you liked.
But um,

3266
02:26:07,240 --> 02:26:08,073
the,
there's something about it also to me 

3267
02:26:10,541 --> 02:26:14,350
because this is a subject that I am 
engrossed in,

3268
02:26:14,610 --> 02:26:17,950
like almost every next week I read about
artificial intelligence.

3269
02:26:17,950 --> 02:26:20,810
Almost everyday I get up,
I'll go to scientific american,

3270
02:26:20,830 --> 02:26:23,650
I got all these different websites and I
search.

3271
02:26:23,651 --> 02:26:26,770
I will look up artificial intelligence,
go to news,

3272
02:26:26,890 --> 02:26:27,723
read tHe latest shit,
and I am is one of the main subjects 

3273
02:26:31,241 --> 02:26:34,420
that repeats in my mind like a metronome
all day long.

3274
02:26:34,450 --> 02:26:35,283
That's your thing,
so that's why you love the movie and 

3275
02:26:36,421 --> 02:26:38,860
it's going to change.
It's going to change our paradigm.

3276
02:26:38,900 --> 02:26:40,780
I think it's going to be the future of 
government.

3277
02:26:41,230 --> 02:26:42,063
I think I really do.
I think we're going to have rules that 

3278
02:26:44,021 --> 02:26:46,990
are established by artificial 
intelligence and that's gonna.

3279
02:26:47,200 --> 02:26:48,033
That's gOnna be how we decide and act 
and how we decide and make choices to 

3280
02:26:51,720 --> 02:26:53,110
see the robots are going to start 
running.

3281
02:26:53,111 --> 02:26:54,340
Shit.
I really do believe that.

3282
02:26:54,341 --> 02:26:55,174
I think that's going to be the solution 
to the cult of personality that we're 

3283
02:26:56,771 --> 02:26:59,770
dealing with right now with Donald Trump
being the front runner for president.

3284
02:26:59,800 --> 02:27:01,390
How crazy is that?
I got to tell you right now,

3285
02:27:01,510 --> 02:27:04,090
hillary clinton is not going to beat 
Donald Trump.

3286
02:27:05,220 --> 02:27:06,053
Yes,
she is.

3287
02:27:06,130 --> 02:27:06,851
No,
she's not.

3288
02:27:06,851 --> 02:27:08,850
I just didn't have a chance.
You're out of your mind.

3289
02:27:09,340 --> 02:27:11,350
Is telling you the numbers,
the numbers,

3290
02:27:11,351 --> 02:27:14,010
any political pundit and the numbers 
just don't add up for trump.

3291
02:27:14,140 --> 02:27:14,973
Not true.
They were saying the numbers didn't add 

3292
02:27:16,181 --> 02:27:18,430
up for him six months ago and they said 
he didn't have a chance.

3293
02:27:18,431 --> 02:27:21,550
And that sounds like changing are by far
right now unless something changes,

3294
02:27:21,700 --> 02:27:25,390
you know,
kind of see this guy to get acting gigs.

3295
02:27:25,600 --> 02:27:29,840
No,
either one audition.

3296
02:27:31,380 --> 02:27:32,800
Hey brian,
I don't have a dog in the phone.

3297
02:27:32,870 --> 02:27:36,970
I like either for you.
Make the statement,

3298
02:27:36,971 --> 02:27:38,260
jamie,
look up the numbers.

3299
02:27:38,440 --> 02:27:39,970
Hillary clinton's,
uh,

3300
02:27:40,420 --> 02:27:43,420
what does it support the approval 
approval.

3301
02:27:43,421 --> 02:27:44,254
Waiting versus donald.
Let's just look at this and then you 

3302
02:27:45,971 --> 02:27:47,150
come in before you go.

3303
02:27:47,290 --> 02:27:49,150
She's going to win the election.
First of all,

3304
02:27:49,151 --> 02:27:49,984
she has huge problems in that.
She's involved in a criminal 

3305
02:27:52,121 --> 02:27:53,890
investigation.
Might be indicted.

3306
02:27:53,891 --> 02:27:55,710
That's,
that's a big issue.

3307
02:27:55,770 --> 02:27:58,000
That's the black swan.
The big black swan.

3308
02:27:58,060 --> 02:28:00,160
The big fucking issue is that email 
thing.

3309
02:28:00,161 --> 02:28:02,810
I had Mike Baker on formally cia 
operator,

3310
02:28:03,220 --> 02:28:04,053
cra opera operative and he was on 
yesterday and he was saying anybody 

3311
02:28:07,151 --> 02:28:07,984
else?
You said it Was me that did the same 

3312
02:28:08,981 --> 02:28:10,300
thing she did.
I'd be in jail.

3313
02:28:10,470 --> 02:28:11,303
Yeah.
He's talking about how they cut and 

3314
02:28:12,401 --> 02:28:13,234
pasted.
Yeah.

3315
02:28:13,420 --> 02:28:14,590
Okay.
Let's see what we got here.

3316
02:28:15,340 --> 02:28:16,173
What is,
what Is the red and what is the blue 

3317
02:28:18,400 --> 02:28:20,280
blue's clinton.
So she's way ahead of them.

3318
02:28:20,540 --> 02:28:23,000
Every three to 44,
43 to 46 percent.

3319
02:28:23,001 --> 02:28:24,800
what does that graph then?
Why is she above him?

3320
02:28:25,730 --> 02:28:27,890
Was that representing time?

3321
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:32,540
Don't understand that graph.
What does that graph mean?

3322
02:28:32,541 --> 02:28:33,740
Then?
Percentage of votes.

3323
02:28:33,770 --> 02:28:34,880
Pull rep,
pull average.

3324
02:28:34,940 --> 02:28:35,773
She's way ahead way ahead and african 
americans and latino votes and there's 

3325
02:28:40,161 --> 02:28:41,840
no way he's gonna cover.
Close that gap.

3326
02:28:41,870 --> 02:28:44,840
She's three percent has also got tired 
of the democrats.

3327
02:28:44,841 --> 02:28:45,674
From what I understand,
women who I think are really down a 

3328
02:28:48,040 --> 02:28:51,440
tough time of women to who's going to be
with her and who's going to be with him.

3329
02:28:51,830 --> 02:28:53,180
I can't believe that was going to be the
running.

3330
02:28:53,780 --> 02:28:56,840
Everybody will be with trump except for 
not me running mates.

3331
02:28:56,930 --> 02:28:57,763
Oh,
running.

3332
02:28:58,270 --> 02:29:00,110
Who's going to be his running mate?
Christine?

3333
02:29:00,620 --> 02:29:03,460
No fucking way is that fat slob doors to
him.

3334
02:29:03,470 --> 02:29:05,470
His fat ass endorsed.
Heres this.

3335
02:29:05,480 --> 02:29:06,650
You can't.
You can't.

3336
02:29:06,651 --> 02:29:08,720
You know,
you can't have an addict,

3337
02:29:08,960 --> 02:29:10,940
by the way,
that guy's an addict with food.

3338
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:12,170
Yes,
he's an addict.

3339
02:29:12,380 --> 02:29:13,430
There's no question about it.

3340
02:29:13,430 --> 02:29:15,710
That kind of got a stomach stapled and 
he's still fat.

3341
02:29:15,740 --> 02:29:16,573
He's crazy.
Fast burst through it or at the 

3342
02:29:19,671 --> 02:29:21,450
baseball,
he's awesome,

3343
02:29:21,620 --> 02:29:24,170
but he's.
He's eating terrible foods.

3344
02:29:24,210 --> 02:29:27,140
It's a terrible thing to him,
and I'm not fat shaming,

3345
02:29:27,350 --> 02:29:28,700
but I'm saying if you're going to have a
leader,

3346
02:29:28,701 --> 02:29:31,100
you cannot have a leader who's by the 
way,

3347
02:29:31,430 --> 02:29:33,950
hugely anti marijuana.
He said,

3348
02:29:33,951 --> 02:29:35,520
marijuana farm,
the president.

3349
02:29:35,540 --> 02:29:38,270
We're going to outlaw all this stuff.
You fucking dummy.

3350
02:29:38,271 --> 02:29:40,880
You don't even understand what you're.
You're.

3351
02:29:40,910 --> 02:29:41,743
You're doing something that's way worse 
for your body than marijuana ever will 

3352
02:29:45,171 --> 02:29:46,004
be critical.
I just don't understand who is going to 

3353
02:29:49,371 --> 02:29:52,490
be like running with this.
If it's rubio,

3354
02:29:52,491 --> 02:29:53,324
he's got a real chance right here.
So participants doing the gops polls 

3355
02:29:56,411 --> 02:29:58,190
show both clinton and sanders smoking 
trump.

3356
02:30:00,050 --> 02:30:01,370
It's not going to happen.
Sorry,

3357
02:30:01,640 --> 02:30:03,680
donald trump's not going to be the 
president and listen that crazy.

3358
02:30:03,680 --> 02:30:07,070
It happened so doom the gop.
Bernie sanders be trump,

3359
02:30:07,960 --> 02:30:08,793
but that's paul's man.
Pulls are only people willing to answer 

3360
02:30:11,031 --> 02:30:15,470
polls and they were really bad polls 
used to be representative of the winter.

3361
02:30:15,471 --> 02:30:16,304
They would go exit polls.
They were so off with with bush versus 

3362
02:30:19,371 --> 02:30:22,580
kerry.
There were so off that they haven't.

3363
02:30:22,610 --> 02:30:24,830
They haven't been actually paul's,
they're just numbers.

3364
02:30:24,900 --> 02:30:26,480
I mean,
most of the political pundits who really

3365
02:30:26,481 --> 02:30:28,940
are in the know.
When brian went bullshitting,

3366
02:30:29,060 --> 02:30:33,530
he does this thing where he calms down 
and instead of getting emotional he just

3367
02:30:33,531 --> 02:30:33,831
like,
well,

3368
02:30:33,831 --> 02:30:37,490
it was more.
I guess he gets like,

3369
02:30:37,491 --> 02:30:41,480
I think his dad used to like chastise 
him and he would say something stupid.

3370
02:30:41,690 --> 02:30:44,280
His dad would know.
My dad would yell,

3371
02:30:44,700 --> 02:30:45,680
oh no,
no,

3372
02:30:45,681 --> 02:30:46,311
no.
He wouldn't do that.

3373
02:30:46,311 --> 02:30:47,420
Now.
My father would do this.

3374
02:30:47,630 --> 02:30:49,760
Go ahead and start making it started 
making a point.

3375
02:30:49,761 --> 02:30:50,870
Watch this,
try this.

3376
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:54,530
Look at this.
Christie faces calls to quit approval.

3377
02:30:54,531 --> 02:30:59,531
Drop after backing trump.
I'm wondering why six newspapers calling

3378
02:30:59,721 --> 02:31:00,554
for him to resign.
The newspapers were they have people 

3379
02:31:04,161 --> 02:31:07,460
with opinions.
Why they asking him to resign?

3380
02:31:07,970 --> 02:31:09,260
Resign.
What though?

3381
02:31:09,261 --> 02:31:13,790
As governor of New Jersey,
why for endorsing trump?

3382
02:31:14,870 --> 02:31:17,180
He's just not a good leader.
He's not,

3383
02:31:17,210 --> 02:31:20,210
he's not a wise man.
He says things.

3384
02:31:20,220 --> 02:31:21,053
who is this?
Trump?

3385
02:31:21,090 --> 02:31:22,470
no,
christie trump.

3386
02:31:22,710 --> 02:31:25,200
I think trump is more of a showman.
I think christine,

3387
02:31:25,270 --> 02:31:29,070
narcissistic entertainer.
Christie says foolish things.

3388
02:31:29,250 --> 02:31:30,083
He says,
foolish things that aren't backed by 

3389
02:31:31,171 --> 02:31:32,004
science.
He's very discriminatory when it comes 

3390
02:31:33,811 --> 02:31:34,644
to my beloved marijuana.
You can't listen to chris christie when 

3391
02:31:36,841 --> 02:31:38,520
you're that fat.
I just can't take you serious.

3392
02:31:38,550 --> 02:31:39,383
Yeah,
and that's.

3393
02:31:39,680 --> 02:31:41,720
You have no discipline.
You don't agree with that.

3394
02:31:42,300 --> 02:31:43,133
I know he's no discipline.
When winston churchill who was a 

3395
02:31:47,681 --> 02:31:51,000
different touch ran and roe,
first of all,

3396
02:31:51,001 --> 02:31:51,834
that's english.
The idea that somebody has a weight 

3397
02:31:53,071 --> 02:31:53,904
problem and they wouldn't be an 
effective leader to me is it doesn't 

3398
02:31:56,131 --> 02:31:57,180
hold water at all.
Really?

3399
02:31:57,181 --> 02:31:58,720
Who's the fattest president we've ever 
had?

3400
02:32:00,340 --> 02:32:02,000
It's not an effective argument.
Well,

3401
02:32:02,010 --> 02:32:02,843
first will be prejudicial.
When churchill was from a long time ago 

3402
02:32:08,040 --> 02:32:11,700
and alcohol was celebrated then as a 
manly thing to consume.

3403
02:32:11,700 --> 02:32:14,370
If You took the fat,
if you took the fat ratio,

3404
02:32:14,371 --> 02:32:15,204
if you took a whatever it is the body 
fat test on some of the ceos are great 

3405
02:32:20,791 --> 02:32:22,920
inventors or scientists or whatever they
were.

3406
02:32:22,940 --> 02:32:23,773
I,
I don't know tHat I'm talking about 

3407
02:32:26,041 --> 02:32:29,910
president president.
I don't have any numbers right now.

3408
02:32:29,911 --> 02:32:32,400
There's never been a fact that.
I mean the idea that because somebody is

3409
02:32:32,401 --> 02:32:34,170
fat and yes,
he has discipline.

3410
02:32:34,780 --> 02:32:36,180
That's just not true.
First of all,

3411
02:32:36,210 --> 02:32:37,440
that's not true.
Hold on.

3412
02:32:37,470 --> 02:32:39,030
He's not just ridiculous.
Hold on.

3413
02:32:39,060 --> 02:32:39,893
He's not fat.
He's a fat guy who's undergone an 

3414
02:32:41,101 --> 02:32:42,650
operation,
not be fat anymore.

3415
02:32:42,660 --> 02:32:45,510
He's still fat.
Saying that you can be.

3416
02:32:45,570 --> 02:32:47,940
You can be not discipline in one area or
life,

3417
02:32:48,090 --> 02:32:51,600
but have a huge brain and huge intellect
that either,

3418
02:32:51,870 --> 02:32:54,480
but he says foolish things and he's fat.
He's a different story.

3419
02:32:54,481 --> 02:32:56,330
I'm just saying in general 70,
when you say,

3420
02:32:56,370 --> 02:32:57,203
when you generalize and say,
I could not vote for somebody or take 

3421
02:32:59,971 --> 02:33:03,090
somebody's seriously as a leader because
they're fat for me.

3422
02:33:03,510 --> 02:33:06,600
I disagree.
I'm saying for me,

3423
02:33:06,601 --> 02:33:07,580
I,
for me,

3424
02:33:07,590 --> 02:33:09,510
discriminatory,
yes it is,

3425
02:33:09,600 --> 02:33:12,480
but it's also judging someone based on 
their own personal choices.

3426
02:33:12,810 --> 02:33:13,643
The choices that you make to be an 
addict and to not seek out healthy food 

3427
02:33:16,680 --> 02:33:20,100
and to seek out body harmony.
His body is out of whack.

3428
02:33:20,580 --> 02:33:25,160
He's like grossly overweight and he went
through going under like he,

3429
02:33:25,220 --> 02:33:29,550
he gave in saying that like I don't have
the discipline to deal with my issue,

3430
02:33:29,610 --> 02:33:32,880
so what I'm going to do is go to a 
doctor and get cut open so my stomach is

3431
02:33:32,881 --> 02:33:33,714
small.
It doesn't matter that there are a lot 

3432
02:33:34,621 --> 02:33:36,390
of great writers there.
Last thing,

3433
02:33:36,450 --> 02:33:37,440
Stephen King,
Stephen King,

3434
02:33:37,450 --> 02:33:38,390
county major.
Oh,

3435
02:33:38,730 --> 02:33:40,170
don't say that.
That doesn't matter.

3436
02:33:40,200 --> 02:33:41,610
That's not related.
What do you mean?

3437
02:33:41,611 --> 02:33:42,444
THe major alcohol problem that he had 
was part of his creative process and 

3438
02:33:45,541 --> 02:33:47,870
that he was a giant books.

3439
02:33:48,240 --> 02:33:51,160
He wrote a book a lot.
I read a book on writing write,

3440
02:33:51,230 --> 02:33:53,190
so I read that book to him.
What did he say in the book?

3441
02:33:53,191 --> 02:33:54,690
He said,
talked about cell.

3442
02:33:54,691 --> 02:33:57,870
He used to drink and do coke and he 
would find these fucking.

3443
02:33:57,990 --> 02:33:58,823
It was a part of his process.
He realized it was killing him because 

3444
02:34:00,360 --> 02:34:03,300
he stopped doing it.
ChrisTie is still eating like a pig.

3445
02:34:03,301 --> 02:34:07,500
Stephen king makes a very important is 
he's an artist.

3446
02:34:07,501 --> 02:34:08,334
He's not a leader of the United States 
to understand if you don't want to vote 

3447
02:34:11,221 --> 02:34:12,054
for your leader because he's heavy.
What I'm saying is that the idea that 

3448
02:34:14,431 --> 02:34:17,860
somebody wouldn't be effective because 
they have a weight problem is erroneous.

3449
02:34:18,140 --> 02:34:20,620
Doesn't know what I'm saying.
Just tell me the biggest president we've

3450
02:34:20,621 --> 02:34:21,830
ever had and go.
Who's the?

3451
02:34:21,900 --> 02:34:24,460
Who's the president?
Not a good argument though,

3452
02:34:25,540 --> 02:34:30,540
because we don't have a ball president.
Believe it was pretty fast.

3453
02:34:30,611 --> 02:34:34,290
Thicker than a snickers right there.
Good.

3454
02:34:34,510 --> 02:34:37,780
Especially back charlie.
He's huge,

3455
02:34:37,781 --> 02:34:39,430
but was he?
Was he a good president?

3456
02:34:41,680 --> 02:34:42,513
Taft was a only input in power for a 
very short period back when people were 

3457
02:34:45,461 --> 02:34:47,890
starving to death,
like when you were a fat.

3458
02:34:47,891 --> 02:34:50,210
It was awesome when people were just 
money.

3459
02:34:50,610 --> 02:34:51,443
Exactly.
Eating and eating and eating and had 

3460
02:34:52,550 --> 02:34:55,930
been been rich.
It to the fact that we live in a cUlture

3461
02:34:55,931 --> 02:34:58,520
now where there's body shaming.
Yeah,

3462
02:34:58,540 --> 02:35:01,450
well you're fucked.
You want as your presIdent?

3463
02:35:01,560 --> 02:35:04,780
Fuck you.
That's not looking so good.

3464
02:35:04,781 --> 02:35:09,781
He's also got this like upper cock fat 
that is so it's got like because called.

3465
02:35:10,560 --> 02:35:11,393
It's called.

3466
02:35:12,130 --> 02:35:14,790
Yeah,
the upper cockfight whiz.

3467
02:35:15,200 --> 02:35:16,033
That's a terrible,
and they don't meet with the other 

3468
02:35:17,860 --> 02:35:18,910
leaders.
They might be right.

3469
02:35:18,911 --> 02:35:21,470
This is post surgery.
Yeah.

3470
02:35:21,730 --> 02:35:23,770
You have to understand like the 
discipline issue,

3471
02:35:24,150 --> 02:35:26,200
real discipline.
I hired an agent I.

3472
02:35:26,260 --> 02:35:28,480
We were talking on the phone.
He was great on paper.

3473
02:35:28,630 --> 02:35:30,060
I met him in person.
I've seen.

3474
02:35:30,070 --> 02:35:31,480
He was letting some stuff slip.
I'm like,

3475
02:35:31,481 --> 02:35:32,130
oh,
that's weirD.

3476
02:35:32,130 --> 02:35:33,940
Me and person.
He's 400 pounds.

3477
02:35:34,330 --> 02:35:35,230
I'll let you go,
man.

3478
02:35:35,600 --> 02:35:38,140
They're often.
There's some sort of discipline issue.

3479
02:35:38,180 --> 02:35:39,013
There has to be day.
You can be in discipline in one side of 

3480
02:35:40,721 --> 02:35:42,790
your life and very disciplined another.
That is true.

3481
02:35:42,880 --> 02:35:45,490
That is true.
It's compartmentalized and sometimes you

3482
02:35:45,491 --> 02:35:48,760
do have an issue and clearly that is a a
food issue,

3483
02:35:49,060 --> 02:35:49,893
but I don't want the president United 
States struggling with his diet when he 

3484
02:35:54,191 --> 02:35:55,480
has to make this huge decision.

3485
02:35:55,480 --> 02:35:56,313
Going back to this,
the biggest fight in his life and his 

3486
02:35:57,821 --> 02:36:00,070
health is in danger.
King makes her interesting distinction.

3487
02:36:00,071 --> 02:36:01,360
Just somebody brought him up and he 
said,

3488
02:36:01,630 --> 02:36:04,330
I was a very talented guy with a 
substance abuse problem.

3489
02:36:04,360 --> 02:36:05,193
That's what he saId.
A lot of people make the mistake of 

3490
02:36:06,461 --> 02:36:09,490
saying that my substance abuse was the 
reason I was so talented.

3491
02:36:09,491 --> 02:36:10,190
He said,
nah,

3492
02:36:10,190 --> 02:36:11,023
that's not necessarily what he said.
What he said was that the creative 

3493
02:36:13,301 --> 02:36:16,240
process was enhanced by his substance 
abuse problem.

3494
02:36:16,390 --> 02:36:17,770
He says,
that's not the case,

3495
02:36:18,160 --> 02:36:18,993
but I'm a Stephen King.
Fan is shit that he wrote when he was 

3496
02:36:21,851 --> 02:36:22,840
fucked up.
That's better.

3497
02:36:22,870 --> 02:36:25,880
Way better.
He does better.

3498
02:36:25,960 --> 02:36:27,730
He's also an artist.
Big difference,

3499
02:36:27,731 --> 02:36:28,860
man.
I want my hardest.

3500
02:36:28,900 --> 02:36:32,500
Students wouldn't want Stephen King when
he was coked up balancing my checkbook,

3501
02:36:33,920 --> 02:36:35,990
but expanding your mind,
he's got to get in there.

3502
02:36:36,310 --> 02:36:38,020
You need to have fucking disciplined.

3503
02:36:38,050 --> 02:36:40,630
To be a president,
you need to be a healthy person.

3504
02:36:40,840 --> 02:36:43,290
You also need to be a role model.
It's like it's not.

3505
02:36:43,330 --> 02:36:45,640
It's a figurehead for the United States 
of America.

3506
02:36:45,641 --> 02:36:50,140
It's not as simple as just saying Jack 
Kennedy was a huge womanizer.

3507
02:36:50,570 --> 02:36:53,350
Consider no,
that's a different thing,

3508
02:36:53,351 --> 02:36:54,340
man.
It's a different thing.

3509
02:36:54,341 --> 02:36:55,990
First of all,
and we didn't know.

3510
02:36:56,290 --> 02:36:59,900
No one knew back the slop what's right 
in front of his face.

3511
02:37:00,980 --> 02:37:03,280
It's a different world.
Back then the world was different,

3512
02:37:03,360 --> 02:37:06,490
but it was a breakdown in,
in self control,

3513
02:37:06,491 --> 02:37:07,324
right?
In one way or an ab or it was just 

3514
02:37:08,441 --> 02:37:13,441
standard operational procedure.
Don'T become a leader by just dating one

3515
02:37:13,601 --> 02:37:14,680
chip.
That's what I'm saying.

3516
02:37:14,800 --> 02:37:16,040
Is dick

3517
02:37:16,040 --> 02:37:20,180
slingers presidential fixing it might be
food though,

3518
02:37:20,181 --> 02:37:21,230
is all I'm saying.
Well,

3519
02:37:21,231 --> 02:37:23,090
it's a different thing though because it
wasn't enough.

3520
02:37:23,150 --> 02:37:25,840
It wasn't interfering with his health.
Like chris christie,

3521
02:37:25,841 --> 02:37:26,674
his physical body is 10 years massively,
massively falling apart and the guy got 

3522
02:37:32,421 --> 02:37:35,240
a fucking operation and it didn't do 
much.

3523
02:37:35,510 --> 02:37:38,660
Me still grossly overweight.
I mean he used to be way bigger.

3524
02:37:38,680 --> 02:37:39,513
It doesn't bother you at all.
Killing must want my president of 

3525
02:37:41,280 --> 02:37:43,640
superhero kind of being a contrarian 
here.

3526
02:37:43,700 --> 02:37:44,533
I really do.
I actually don't know if it bothers me 

3527
02:37:45,741 --> 02:37:47,030
or not what I was.
Let me tell you.

3528
02:37:47,170 --> 02:37:48,350
No,
I.

3529
02:37:48,540 --> 02:37:50,750
I understand that explore and I think 
that's a good point.

3530
02:37:50,830 --> 02:37:52,610
Where sport would it?
Does it bother you?

3531
02:37:52,640 --> 02:37:54,080
You said you don't know if it bothers 
you.

3532
02:37:54,110 --> 02:37:56,150
Just health.
Health is important for presence,

3533
02:37:56,151 --> 02:37:57,680
like they have to go through all those 
health checks.

3534
02:37:57,980 --> 02:37:59,480
That's why trump came out and they said,
fuck.

3535
02:37:59,481 --> 02:38:00,920
They said,
I'm in great shape.

3536
02:38:00,950 --> 02:38:03,830
What's up?
I read obama shit.

3537
02:38:03,970 --> 02:38:07,790
I think that I think that I'm not trying
to be a contrarian at all.

3538
02:38:07,791 --> 02:38:10,400
I understand and respect somebody's 
point of view where they say,

3539
02:38:10,580 --> 02:38:11,413
you know what,
you are not able to control your own 

3540
02:38:13,521 --> 02:38:14,354
biology.
Therefore I wonder what your judgment 

3541
02:38:16,161 --> 02:38:18,080
would be like as a leader.
One hundred percent valid.

3542
02:38:18,110 --> 02:38:20,510
WhaT you're judging a person when 
they're running for president.

3543
02:38:20,511 --> 02:38:22,010
You 100 percent judge.
Sure,

3544
02:38:22,100 --> 02:38:22,933
and we do judge massively short in the 
department of taking care of his own 

3545
02:38:26,721 --> 02:38:28,730
physical being.
Most of us,

3546
02:38:28,731 --> 02:38:31,070
and we know that most of us when we hire
somebody,

3547
02:38:31,260 --> 02:38:33,290
if one guys in shape,
the other guy's not,

3548
02:38:33,680 --> 02:38:37,010
we're gonna just instinctly go.
We're going to make those conclusions.

3549
02:38:37,011 --> 02:38:41,480
And that in a way is fair in terms of 
how you look at the world where you say,

3550
02:38:41,481 --> 02:38:43,610
you know what,
if you can't draw your own biology,

3551
02:38:43,611 --> 02:38:45,260
I wonder what else you can't control.

3552
02:38:45,260 --> 02:38:47,120
And as a fat person,
you know,

3553
02:38:47,121 --> 02:38:50,030
you're walking into that or at least 
have to take responsibility for whatever

3554
02:38:50,031 --> 02:38:53,480
the world by this.
It's so hard thing.

3555
02:38:53,510 --> 02:38:57,110
I just don't buy it.
I just fucking lost 10 pounds.

3556
02:38:57,150 --> 02:38:58,310
I didn't even.
Wasn't even fat.

3557
02:38:58,430 --> 02:39:00,070
It's different.
It's not different.

3558
02:39:00,110 --> 02:39:00,943
Why is it challenging?
Even if he's otherwise did still make 

3559
02:39:04,370 --> 02:39:08,780
decisions for me than it is for him.
I'll tell you how I think some people,

3560
02:39:08,781 --> 02:39:09,614
for example,
have a predilection not only to put on 

3561
02:39:11,361 --> 02:39:14,330
weight because their endocrine system is
just whacked,

3562
02:39:14,600 --> 02:39:15,433
but also some people do have addictions 
and addictions are very powerful and 

3563
02:39:19,601 --> 02:39:21,240
he's an addict.
And some people,

3564
02:39:21,300 --> 02:39:23,150
I don't want to say this,
my president,

3565
02:39:24,710 --> 02:39:26,720
whether it's drugs,
alcohol.

3566
02:39:26,750 --> 02:39:30,410
That's what I'm saying is that what I'm 
saying is that to just.

3567
02:39:30,840 --> 02:39:31,673
We live in a culture now that just puts 
so much emphasis on the physical and I 

3568
02:39:35,331 --> 02:39:36,164
think there are a lot of people who have
been overweight and who have eaten too 

3569
02:39:39,861 --> 02:39:43,900
much or had a thing for sugar who still 
are incredibly,

3570
02:39:44,150 --> 02:39:44,983
incredibly beneficial and to society.
And they would finish things and done 

3571
02:39:48,501 --> 02:39:50,780
things that you know that.
And they were just.

3572
02:39:50,810 --> 02:39:53,000
They were huge.
They were huge intellects.

3573
02:39:53,060 --> 02:39:54,230
Yeah.
Well that's a different story.

3574
02:39:54,231 --> 02:39:55,064
But they were huge intellects.
That was a lot of smart people that are 

3575
02:39:57,081 --> 02:39:58,370
fat for sure.
But that's.

3576
02:39:58,660 --> 02:40:01,130
You don't want them running the big 
show.

3577
02:40:01,490 --> 02:40:02,323
There's a difference between someone 
who's a really smart fat person who's a 

3578
02:40:05,601 --> 02:40:08,750
great singer or smart fat person who's 
really good at telling jokes.

3579
02:40:09,180 --> 02:40:12,140
There's a big difference between that 
and a fucking president.

3580
02:40:12,141 --> 02:40:13,980
A president is not just

3581
02:40:14,220 --> 02:40:17,910
a guy who can talk to this guy and make 
good decisions.

3582
02:40:17,970 --> 02:40:20,760
He's a fucking figurehead for the United
States of America.

3583
02:40:20,910 --> 02:40:23,280
The greatest super power the world has 
ever known.

3584
02:40:23,490 --> 02:40:25,160
For us to say,
chris christie's,

3585
02:40:25,170 --> 02:40:28,640
the best we could do is a disgrace to 
different subjects like you.

3586
02:40:29,540 --> 02:40:32,850
You have all your bases.
You have to cover all your bases.

3587
02:40:32,910 --> 02:40:35,360
It's exactly the subject.
What's that?

3588
02:40:35,580 --> 02:40:37,140
You're talking specifically about chris 
christie.

3589
02:40:37,141 --> 02:40:39,110
I'm talking about somebody talked about.
Yeah,

3590
02:40:39,360 --> 02:40:43,000
we talked about chris christie.
Who stomach got.

3591
02:40:43,230 --> 02:40:45,660
I reacted.
I reacted to.

3592
02:40:45,661 --> 02:40:46,494
I don't know if I could.
I don't want to vote for somebody who 

3593
02:40:49,351 --> 02:40:51,460
looks like that.
Yeah.

3594
02:40:51,560 --> 02:40:52,620
Yeah.
Him and for me,

3595
02:40:52,621 --> 02:40:53,920
it wouldn't make as much.
He's the only one.

3596
02:40:55,490 --> 02:40:56,270
He's the only one.
You're.

3597
02:40:56,270 --> 02:40:59,650
You're arguing semantics now because 
that's the one guy looks like that.

3598
02:40:59,730 --> 02:41:01,920
He's the only guy.
Maybe trump's not skinny.

3599
02:41:02,190 --> 02:41:03,210
He's a fat fuck too.

3600
02:41:03,440 --> 02:41:04,740
If you saw trump,
but I was close on.

3601
02:41:04,741 --> 02:41:05,760
You throw up.
Exactly.

3602
02:41:06,240 --> 02:41:08,540
Trump.
Trump killed him.

3603
02:41:08,590 --> 02:41:12,840
Those fucking welcome to my nightmare.
All those guys together.

3604
02:41:13,050 --> 02:41:13,520
Look,
I,

3605
02:41:13,520 --> 02:41:17,850
I'm,
I'm sure there's rubio flexing on them.

3606
02:41:17,890 --> 02:41:19,650
Fools.
First of all,

3607
02:41:19,680 --> 02:41:21,650
who are those other people?
Where you guys?

3608
02:41:21,660 --> 02:41:26,520
Ted cruz and chris christie.
Marco rubio ran parson ben carson.

3609
02:41:26,580 --> 02:41:28,860
Who's that other guy?
Dennis Dennis Case,

3610
02:41:28,861 --> 02:41:31,020
which I think that stands.
He's the governor.

3611
02:41:31,210 --> 02:41:33,000
Governor had done a good job.
Yeah.

3612
02:41:33,210 --> 02:41:36,780
Then you have a jelly shows.
He's alive.

3613
02:41:37,220 --> 02:41:41,630
You have priority voting for that guy.
Jeb bush is always put on way too.

3614
02:41:41,650 --> 02:41:42,840
He's got it.
He's always been a problem.

3615
02:41:42,870 --> 02:41:45,780
How is this guy still in there that 
keisha shish guy was.

3616
02:41:45,810 --> 02:41:47,750
He was a pretty effective as Ohio 
governor.

3617
02:41:47,760 --> 02:41:51,900
Photos come out of all those guys like a
orgy.

3618
02:41:52,190 --> 02:41:56,550
So weird.
Like finally I'm what's left again.

3619
02:41:56,830 --> 02:41:57,870
I'm all I'm thinking about.

3620
02:41:57,930 --> 02:42:00,590
Is the mma fan going?
What the fuck man.

3621
02:42:01,660 --> 02:42:02,493
Fucking breakdown by chris christie.
We didn't promise it would've said we 

3622
02:42:06,780 --> 02:42:07,900
warned you.
We.

3623
02:42:07,901 --> 02:42:10,530
We talked about conor for an hour.
No,

3624
02:42:10,680 --> 02:42:12,710
10 minutes.
Connor.

3625
02:42:14,580 --> 02:42:15,413
We broke some of.
And wHat do you think about who's going 

3626
02:42:16,970 --> 02:42:17,771
to win?
Thank you.

3627
02:42:17,771 --> 02:42:21,210
Janet had just put the fucking.
let's go.

3628
02:42:21,270 --> 02:42:23,520
Yeah,
I fucking hate this.

3629
02:42:23,730 --> 02:42:26,550
Chris christie talk makes me angry.
Fucking horrible politics.

3630
02:42:26,590 --> 02:42:29,570
She's was watching you guys the fucking 
thing,

3631
02:42:29,610 --> 02:42:30,443
man.
That's my state where I was born and 

3632
02:42:31,411 --> 02:42:32,810
that.
That reminds you,

3633
02:42:34,300 --> 02:42:36,570
reminds you of a lot of shit that he did
with the bridge.

3634
02:42:36,571 --> 02:42:40,110
The shutting down that bridge to 
political decision to make.

3635
02:42:40,410 --> 02:42:42,120
To do that.
It's so far.

3636
02:42:42,150 --> 02:42:43,600
It's criminal.
It's criminal.

3637
02:42:43,630 --> 02:42:47,010
Shut down a bridge to try to.
I don't want to talk about it.

3638
02:42:47,130 --> 02:42:51,050
Get angry.
Get fucking fights.

3639
02:42:51,270 --> 02:42:55,440
So we know the size difference we were 
to their heights.

3640
02:42:56,250 --> 02:42:58,460
I guess it doesn't really matter.
Think taller.

3641
02:42:58,690 --> 02:42:59,523
Yeah.
Three inches taller and he has a two 

3642
02:43:01,321 --> 02:43:03,840
inch reach advantage says to.
Yeah.

3643
02:43:04,110 --> 02:43:05,520
Hmm.
That's interesting.

3644
02:43:05,580 --> 02:43:07,500
That's going to play a big factor 
because obviously,

3645
02:43:07,620 --> 02:43:11,650
and moves in so much isn't used to 
fighting bigger guy,

3646
02:43:11,651 --> 02:43:13,080
but now he is.
But the thing is,

3647
02:43:13,630 --> 02:43:16,870
if you've seen pictures of the video is 
he's fucking huge right now.

3648
02:43:17,860 --> 02:43:19,010
The leg reach thing,
he's,

3649
02:43:19,120 --> 02:43:20,690
he's got longer legs to.
yeah,

3650
02:43:22,030 --> 02:43:22,790
there you go.
Exactly.

3651
02:43:22,790 --> 02:43:24,790
He uses them real well and really well 
at distance.

3652
02:43:24,791 --> 02:43:27,340
It's not like me where I just want to 
step in and club your legs.

3653
02:43:27,341 --> 02:43:28,174
He's trying to try to try to negate that
gap between him and he likes to throw a 

3654
02:43:31,691 --> 02:43:36,691
lot of front kicks to the body like you 
did with Chad and the against the ideas.

3655
02:43:37,150 --> 02:43:39,280
Let me ask you this on creepy.
How about uh,

3656
02:43:40,330 --> 02:43:42,470
uh,
w with connor,

3657
02:43:42,790 --> 02:43:44,200
he's always been the bully,
right?

3658
02:43:44,200 --> 02:43:45,033
He's kind of bullied the 1:45
division and then now here there's no 

3659
02:43:48,011 --> 02:43:48,611
way,
you know,

3660
02:43:48,611 --> 02:43:49,444
he's just not bigger than dia's.
So I think it's the first time we're 

3661
02:43:51,881 --> 02:43:55,540
really going to see him where his size 
and can be that advantage anymore.

3662
02:43:55,541 --> 02:43:59,950
But he's pretty goddamn big right now.
He wAs training for fighting at 1:55,

3663
02:43:59,951 --> 02:44:02,140
which means he ate like a pig,
fought at 1:55

3664
02:44:02,141 --> 02:44:04,810
and in the uk.
So he's fought at 1:55

3665
02:44:04,811 --> 02:44:05,644
before and starch guys with one shot.
I absoluTely believe it's power carries 

3666
02:44:09,191 --> 02:44:13,420
over 200 percent to 1:55.
and this fight is essentially at one 70,

3667
02:44:13,421 --> 02:44:16,000
but it's,
these are one $55 that don't have to cut

3668
02:44:16,001 --> 02:44:17,050
weight.
That's what's going on.

3669
02:44:17,290 --> 02:44:19,690
They don't have to cut weight because it
was part of the agreement.

3670
02:44:19,691 --> 02:44:22,270
When nate took the fight,
they took it at a catch weight.

3671
02:44:22,320 --> 02:44:22,770
Well,
you know,

3672
02:44:22,770 --> 02:44:27,770
deals was down to go to I think one,
six x five slash 16 congress.

3673
02:44:27,900 --> 02:44:28,331
No,
no man,

3674
02:44:28,331 --> 02:44:29,164
I want you to.
I want you to have the advantage here 

3675
02:44:30,161 --> 02:44:30,880
and the weight.
What?

3676
02:44:30,880 --> 02:44:32,920
We're going to make it one 70.
Don't kill yourself.

3677
02:44:32,930 --> 02:44:34,540
Don't want to cut weight.
Look.

3678
02:44:34,600 --> 02:44:35,920
And you shouldn't.
I think.

3679
02:44:35,921 --> 02:44:36,754
Listen,
I think this is the future and I really 

3680
02:44:37,991 --> 02:44:42,700
truly hope that people decide to fight 
at a much more reasonable weight class.

3681
02:44:42,701 --> 02:44:44,740
I think they decided to do this where 
they fight,

3682
02:44:44,770 --> 02:44:49,390
where they actually belong and stopped 
this dehydration process.

3683
02:44:49,391 --> 02:44:50,920
Man,
it's fucking madness.

3684
02:44:51,100 --> 02:44:55,060
It's the worst aspect of mma.
The most dangerous aspect of mma.

3685
02:44:55,420 --> 02:44:58,660
The scariest now because there's no ivy 
rehydration,

3686
02:44:58,661 --> 02:45:02,590
so these people are going in there with 
dehydrated brains and it taken shots.

3687
02:45:02,620 --> 02:45:04,900
The fucking dome.
I think it's stupid.

3688
02:45:04,901 --> 02:45:05,734
It ruins Your chin.
It ruins your ability to fight at the 

3689
02:45:07,391 --> 02:45:09,700
best level and lung.
Longevity,

3690
02:45:09,701 --> 02:45:11,200
longevity also.
Yeah.

3691
02:45:11,230 --> 02:45:14,080
The a huge x factor too Is nate diaz.

3692
02:45:14,080 --> 02:45:14,501
They go,
well,

3693
02:45:14,501 --> 02:45:17,020
he's getting ready for a trIathlon.
I don't give a fuck.

3694
02:45:17,021 --> 02:45:19,480
That's not five rounds of fighting the 
ufc.

3695
02:45:19,600 --> 02:45:22,240
I don't care what you're doing.
There's no way you can make up for that.

3696
02:45:22,330 --> 02:45:23,163
Well,
I don't know because I don't know what 

3697
02:45:24,221 --> 02:45:26,470
else he was doing other than training 
for the triathlon.

3698
02:45:26,471 --> 02:45:28,900
I don't know if he's doing jujitsu.
I don't know if he was boxing.

3699
02:45:29,230 --> 02:45:31,420
I know he's definitely training for a 
triathlon though,

3700
02:45:31,450 --> 02:45:35,080
which means it's not like you caught him
sitting on the couch doing bong hits and

3701
02:45:35,081 --> 02:45:37,210
eating cheetos.
True guys in really good shape,

3702
02:45:37,410 --> 02:45:39,220
different shape.
it is a different shape,

3703
02:45:39,221 --> 02:45:40,054
but there's also no wear and tear from a
fight camp and that can be a big factor 

3704
02:45:43,241 --> 02:45:44,230
in his favor.
well,

3705
02:45:44,240 --> 02:45:45,420
diaz did say he goes,
you know,

3706
02:45:45,760 --> 02:45:47,020
to me there's no pressure.
I mean,

3707
02:45:47,021 --> 02:45:47,740
he goes,
I've had,

3708
02:45:47,740 --> 02:45:49,480
I've had cancer,
I've had full camps.

3709
02:45:49,490 --> 02:45:50,323
I went in there and got my ass whooped.
You and I've had times where I was 

3710
02:45:52,421 --> 02:45:54,790
sitting on the couch for three weeks,
went into the gym,

3711
02:45:54,791 --> 02:45:56,230
beat everybody up.
He's like,

3712
02:45:56,231 --> 02:45:57,790
so for me it's,
you know,

3713
02:45:57,820 --> 02:45:59,860
it's just another day.
I think a big factor,

3714
02:45:59,890 --> 02:46:02,500
a really big factor is the fact that he 
doesn't have to cut weight.

3715
02:46:02,790 --> 02:46:05,880
I think it's a big factor for connor to.
I mean when we might see the best condom

3716
02:46:05,900 --> 02:46:08,740
we've ever seen because seeing him at 
145 pounds,

3717
02:46:08,741 --> 02:46:11,320
that guy was on death's door the day 
before the fight,

3718
02:46:11,570 --> 02:46:12,403
the Chad mendez fight.
He looked like uttered dog shit at the 

3719
02:46:14,871 --> 02:46:15,704
weigh ins and then the next day he's 
full and thick and probably 20 plus 

3720
02:46:20,091 --> 02:46:24,220
pounds heavier than he was at the wayne.
I'll tell you what gets scary is if diaz

3721
02:46:24,230 --> 02:46:26,610
does get mcgregor down.
Oh yeah.

3722
02:46:27,270 --> 02:46:28,320
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.

3723
02:46:28,820 --> 02:46:29,810
Mcgregor.
It's very scary.

3724
02:46:29,830 --> 02:46:30,663
Oh,
you're talking about a high level 

3725
02:46:31,131 --> 02:46:35,330
jujitsu with lots of submissions and tse
has got some serious fucking skills from

3726
02:46:35,331 --> 02:46:36,650
top and bottom to.
Yeah.

3727
02:46:36,800 --> 02:46:37,670
Really,
really good.

3728
02:46:37,671 --> 02:46:39,860
You just too.
But see george lockhart has been working

3729
02:46:39,861 --> 02:46:43,140
with george or if conner for the last 
fighter too,

3730
02:46:43,540 --> 02:46:47,570
so you know that he's not just eating a 
bunch of shit.

3731
02:46:47,590 --> 02:46:50,480
Right?
He's putting mean on a cellular level.

3732
02:46:50,481 --> 02:46:53,180
He's,
he's energizing his body With really,

3733
02:46:53,181 --> 02:46:57,800
really good high high energy fuel stuff.
So him putting on that much weight,

3734
02:46:58,340 --> 02:47:01,580
which is just more natural form.
He's going to be fucking so strong,

3735
02:47:01,581 --> 02:47:02,650
so strong.
Such good cars.

3736
02:47:02,700 --> 02:47:04,010
So healthy.
So healthy.

3737
02:47:04,011 --> 02:47:05,180
You know,
if he gets by this,

3738
02:47:05,181 --> 02:47:08,360
I think you have to do ufc 200 if dos 
anjos is ready.

3739
02:47:08,410 --> 02:47:09,440
Yeah.
If we can inspire them.

3740
02:47:09,470 --> 02:47:12,170
But with that said,
if would have nate diaz lights them up.

3741
02:47:12,240 --> 02:47:13,880
My,
I don't see that happening.

3742
02:47:14,720 --> 02:47:16,280
Then we don't have to deal with this 
shit anymore.

3743
02:47:16,770 --> 02:47:18,850
Well we do.
You want to deal with this shit though?

3744
02:47:19,490 --> 02:47:22,190
We trust the sport needs that man.
I don't want.

3745
02:47:22,750 --> 02:47:24,830
I don't want.
I don't want the connor shorter ads like

3746
02:47:24,831 --> 02:47:26,900
I want it to keep going.
I really.

3747
02:47:26,901 --> 02:47:27,734
It's magical.
It's magical because he is got the guts 

3748
02:47:30,561 --> 02:47:35,300
to talk so big and then just to go up to
78 and he's just.

3749
02:47:35,301 --> 02:47:37,730
Yeah,
but I don't think nate diaz,

3750
02:47:37,790 --> 02:47:40,790
if he beats him,
I don't think he ends the connor train.

3751
02:47:41,030 --> 02:47:41,863
I think he stops it momentarily.
There's a regrouping and he comes back 

3752
02:47:45,470 --> 02:47:47,050
better than ever.
I just don't.

3753
02:47:47,080 --> 02:47:49,790
I don't think losing to nate diaz stops 
everything.

3754
02:47:49,791 --> 02:47:52,280
I think it definitely hits a bump in the
road,

3755
02:47:52,340 --> 02:47:53,860
man.
No more of that.

3756
02:47:53,870 --> 02:47:54,703
Undefeated or anymore.
We'll look at what happened to manny 

3757
02:47:56,601 --> 02:47:57,020
pacquiao.

3758
02:47:57,020 --> 02:48:00,130
I fought one male,
one male marquez and got knocked dead.

3759
02:48:00,270 --> 02:48:02,090
Look,
I planted the same.

3760
02:48:02,450 --> 02:48:03,283
Not the same,
but he came back and it's still just as 

3761
02:48:05,031 --> 02:48:08,900
huge as he's ever been mad.
It's not the same as floyd though.

3762
02:48:09,050 --> 02:48:10,670
Like floyd was huge.
right?

3763
02:48:10,671 --> 02:48:12,590
Never lost.
Even though it's fights were born.

3764
02:48:12,591 --> 02:48:14,270
We still tuned in.
He's still the best of all time.

3765
02:48:14,271 --> 02:48:16,640
He had like this huge undefeated or 
about him.

3766
02:48:16,730 --> 02:48:19,550
He loses with his fighting style.
Get the fuck out.

3767
02:48:19,610 --> 02:48:20,480
Well,
if he loses,

3768
02:48:21,220 --> 02:48:24,680
he's boring to watch undefeated,
so that's tuned in.

3769
02:48:24,700 --> 02:48:25,533
He also refused to find some guys in 
their prime like manny pacquiao five 

3770
02:48:28,911 --> 02:48:30,050
years ago,
six years ago,

3771
02:48:30,680 --> 02:48:31,513
but stand up.
Stop right there because he had a real 

3772
02:48:33,231 --> 02:48:36,350
good argument that manny pacquiao was 
most likely on performance.

3773
02:48:36,351 --> 02:48:38,060
Enhance,
refused to take the drug test.

3774
02:48:38,061 --> 02:48:38,894
So there's a reason why it moved up.
Eight weight classes kept his knockout 

3775
02:48:45,050 --> 02:48:45,950
power.
Look,

3776
02:48:46,100 --> 02:48:48,830
I don't know whether or not many it did 
anything,

3777
02:48:48,831 --> 02:48:50,960
but that alex a risa guy that was with 
him,

3778
02:48:51,290 --> 02:48:52,123
that guy torso notoriously known for it.
That was a strength and conditioning 

3779
02:48:55,881 --> 02:49:00,881
coach and the reputation is usually.
It's usually pretty active.

3780
02:49:01,940 --> 02:49:04,370
Jose conseco in my corner and then be 
like,

3781
02:49:04,371 --> 02:49:08,240
I don't know man.
One hundred and 98 pounds.

3782
02:49:08,340 --> 02:49:11,370
It's weird.
You went up eight waist classes and jose

3783
02:49:11,371 --> 02:49:14,820
conseco says fucking best friend.
I think he's good man.

3784
02:49:15,690 --> 02:49:18,480
Strength and conditioning coach.
A lot of guys get purple like that.

3785
02:49:18,481 --> 02:49:19,314
What happens?
I guess it's like blood rushing to your 

3786
02:49:20,851 --> 02:49:21,684
skin or something.
They get a sweat on flexing and they 

3787
02:49:25,521 --> 02:49:27,030
just.
Yeah.

3788
02:49:27,630 --> 02:49:31,440
Well also I think when you take a lot of
testosterone like that,

3789
02:49:31,441 --> 02:49:33,170
from what I understand,
like you developed,

3790
02:49:33,180 --> 02:49:36,030
you have more blood,
you have more blood in your system.

3791
02:49:36,420 --> 02:49:37,253
Yeah.
Like this dude I knew who was on like 

3792
02:49:38,900 --> 02:49:42,180
heavy dose of testosterone.
His doctor,

3793
02:49:42,410 --> 02:49:43,243
he was going to.
He's doing some endurance thing and his 

3794
02:49:44,910 --> 02:49:47,430
doctor told him,
you should give blood.

3795
02:49:47,880 --> 02:49:49,830
You should take some blood out of your 
body.

3796
02:49:49,831 --> 02:49:51,600
Before he was going to do some crazy 
bike ride,

3797
02:49:51,930 --> 02:49:54,480
like you should get rid out of your 
body,

3798
02:49:55,520 --> 02:49:58,450
your blood do thick.

3799
02:49:59,290 --> 02:50:00,123
There's a theory that says that the 
reason women don't die of heart 

3800
02:50:03,151 --> 02:50:03,984
problems,
they don't have the kind of cholesterol 

3801
02:50:04,831 --> 02:50:05,664
issues is because they bleed once a 
month and and this guy said if you give 

3802
02:50:08,221 --> 02:50:09,054
blood once a year,
it might be the best thing you can do 

3803
02:50:10,321 --> 02:50:11,910
for your heart.
Your body.

3804
02:50:11,911 --> 02:50:12,900
Yeah.
Why?

3805
02:50:13,200 --> 02:50:17,820
Because apparently it keeps your blood 
thInner and so as a result you will.

3806
02:50:17,821 --> 02:50:18,571
And I'm,
by the way,

3807
02:50:18,571 --> 02:50:20,160
I'm not a doctor,
I'm paraphrasing this guy,

3808
02:50:20,161 --> 02:50:22,440
so please don't kill me.
Play exactly.

3809
02:50:22,441 --> 02:50:23,274
But essentially he said you can lower 
your lipid levels and all this other 

3810
02:50:28,081 --> 02:50:30,720
stuff by giving blood once a year and it
makes a huge difference.

3811
02:50:31,320 --> 02:50:31,830
Uh,
it's a,

3812
02:50:31,830 --> 02:50:33,420
it's a school of thought.
It's been,

3813
02:50:33,830 --> 02:50:36,900
it's been disputed,
like a pint,

3814
02:50:36,930 --> 02:50:37,920
I guess.
Been disputed.

3815
02:50:37,921 --> 02:50:38,600
whoa.
What,

3816
02:50:38,600 --> 02:50:40,140
what was,
what's supposed to be the benefit?

3817
02:50:40,141 --> 02:50:43,080
How's it lower your blood?
So I guess apparently you,

3818
02:50:43,081 --> 02:50:45,240
like you said,
you get thick,

3819
02:50:45,350 --> 02:50:46,470
you know,
your blood gets thick,

3820
02:50:46,471 --> 02:50:47,304
you get an and,
and it kind of acts as I suppose like 

3821
02:50:49,681 --> 02:50:50,514
aspirin would where you are,
your blood gets into your body to 

3822
02:50:52,911 --> 02:50:54,570
rejuvenate and more blood than.

3823
02:50:54,570 --> 02:50:57,690
It was interesting that women don't get 
the kind of heart attacks that men do.

3824
02:50:57,720 --> 02:50:59,580
I always attributed that to stress.
Well,

3825
02:50:59,581 --> 02:51:00,410
no,
it's estrogen.

3826
02:51:00,410 --> 02:51:01,243
I thought estrogen and it's also 
according to this coUple oF these 

3827
02:51:04,651 --> 02:51:08,730
doCtors that they,
they bleed once a month and that hasn't,

3828
02:51:08,870 --> 02:51:11,340
that has an effect because they're evil 
creatures.

3829
02:51:12,240 --> 02:51:12,901
Excuse me,
sir.

3830
02:51:12,901 --> 02:51:14,450
Excuse me.
They give heart attacks.

3831
02:51:14,490 --> 02:51:15,720
Don't get them.
That's true.

3832
02:51:16,000 --> 02:51:18,660
But I cut myself in,
suck on it.

3833
02:51:18,670 --> 02:51:19,910
Like I thought,
you know,

3834
02:51:19,920 --> 02:51:21,630
I kinda like,
oh shit and that.

3835
02:51:22,110 --> 02:51:23,640
No,
we didn't cut yourself on purpose.

3836
02:51:24,210 --> 02:51:25,043
Fall down and scrape myself and suck 
because I thought it would go back into 

3837
02:51:27,901 --> 02:51:30,690
my bottle.
Give wrong stupid.

3838
02:51:30,830 --> 02:51:33,900
Kinda does kind of just doesn't go back 
into your blood.

3839
02:51:34,320 --> 02:51:35,153
THe nutrients go in your body.
You would think I want to go do a full 

3840
02:51:37,891 --> 02:51:40,740
like screening of vitamins,
hormones,

3841
02:51:40,741 --> 02:51:43,150
everything I've ever done that.
Have you done cryotherapy yet?

3842
02:51:43,510 --> 02:51:44,850
Let's go do it right now.
Dude.

3843
02:51:44,851 --> 02:51:47,610
I got into a really cold pool.
Almost panicked.

3844
02:51:47,650 --> 02:51:50,600
Those aren't the same.
My asshole heart both were like,

3845
02:51:51,160 --> 02:51:53,180
that's not like an ice bath.
It's not.

3846
02:51:53,610 --> 02:51:55,890
To me it's the ice baths.
Stronger,

3847
02:51:55,920 --> 02:51:58,310
stronger for,
for me,

3848
02:51:58,320 --> 02:52:02,400
an ice bath is more effective.
Well that's what I'm iceman hof.

3849
02:52:02,401 --> 02:52:04,170
Wim hoff.
He said like for your,

3850
02:52:04,171 --> 02:52:05,800
like your soul,
like your,

3851
02:52:05,880 --> 02:52:06,050
your

3852
02:52:06,050 --> 02:52:10,750
resiliency and being able to overcome a 
nice bath is better.

3853
02:52:10,810 --> 02:52:12,960
It's way longer because it's just your,
you know,

3854
02:52:12,961 --> 02:52:13,794
your porn bags of fucking ice in tHat 
water and you get in there and you're 

3855
02:52:16,840 --> 02:52:20,230
brutalized for saudi minutes.
Some people swear by cryo therapy.

3856
02:52:20,231 --> 02:52:21,064
I did it.
My last camp I did it four times a week 

3857
02:52:22,871 --> 02:52:25,780
and I didn't see much of a difference as
opposed to ice baths,

3858
02:52:25,840 --> 02:52:28,150
so I stopped doing with ice bath.
Maybe it's a.

3859
02:52:28,151 --> 02:52:28,984
I'm like what you felt versus the actual
anti inflammation markers in your blood 

3860
02:52:34,750 --> 02:52:37,990
because they've definitely shown that 
there's a there.

3861
02:52:38,140 --> 02:52:41,280
It reduces inflammation.
pretty radically better.

3862
02:52:41,350 --> 02:52:43,960
Better than an ice bath,
but better because I don't.

3863
02:52:43,961 --> 02:52:45,970
I don't know.
I don't know how much.

3864
02:52:46,690 --> 02:52:49,630
How much has been shown that a ice bath 
do?

3865
02:52:49,690 --> 02:52:50,523
I don't know.
I'm more aware of what they've shown 

3866
02:52:51,911 --> 02:52:55,480
from a cryotherapy,
but where it's really effective.

3867
02:52:55,480 --> 02:52:58,360
It's for people with arthritis.
This is lady that goes to the place that

3868
02:52:58,361 --> 02:53:01,300
I go to and this poor lady,
her hands are jacked man.

3869
02:53:01,480 --> 02:53:03,520
like her whole life or has it been like 
this?

3870
02:53:03,521 --> 02:53:04,354
Just like snarled up clause and she now 
for the first time in a decade can 

3871
02:53:09,231 --> 02:53:12,430
straighten her fingers out and she never
thought about just filling up buckets of

3872
02:53:12,431 --> 02:53:15,310
ice and put.
It seems like you should write maybe.

3873
02:53:15,311 --> 02:53:17,260
I don't know what she's done before.
I should've asked her.

3874
02:53:17,530 --> 02:53:17,841
Well,
it's,

3875
02:53:17,841 --> 02:53:18,674
it's like my daughter.
I'm actually partnering up with the 

3876
02:53:20,741 --> 02:53:23,950
cryoablation in lake forest or balls 
deep opening up march,

3877
02:53:23,980 --> 02:53:24,813
March 15th.
We opened up March 15th called therapy 

3878
02:53:27,401 --> 02:53:29,530
kraus along lake forest.
Um,

3879
02:53:30,070 --> 02:53:31,990
my daughter has juvenile rheumatoid 
arthritis.

3880
02:53:32,320 --> 02:53:36,910
I take her in my craft machine or my,
the lady I used to go to monica newport,

3881
02:53:37,300 --> 02:53:39,050
our custom mesa.
Well,

3882
02:53:39,880 --> 02:53:43,360
it sparked my interest and then I 
realized that it fucking works.

3883
02:53:43,540 --> 02:53:45,250
You know,
the science is behind it.

3884
02:53:45,300 --> 02:53:46,133
I'm talking about how deeply penetrates.
I heard it penetrates deeper than a ice 

3885
02:53:49,781 --> 02:53:52,450
bath,
but I've done ice baths my whole life.

3886
02:53:52,480 --> 02:53:55,060
they're fucking way different.
TheY hurt my toes and feet.

3887
02:53:55,061 --> 02:53:58,000
So I'm always like trying to stick them 
into the pain to.

3888
02:53:58,001 --> 02:54:02,050
Do they Sit in an ice bath typically 15,
15 minutes?

3889
02:54:02,051 --> 02:54:02,640
Yeah,
I do.

3890
02:54:02,640 --> 02:54:03,670
In both the,
there's a,

3891
02:54:03,671 --> 02:54:06,010
there's a korean bath asked by my gym 
right next,

3892
02:54:06,040 --> 02:54:07,690
right next to it.
So d and I,

3893
02:54:07,710 --> 02:54:09,790
and I don't know this nice bath.
So the korean bath house.

3894
02:54:09,810 --> 02:54:10,940
Oh yeah.
I your sweet.

3895
02:54:10,941 --> 02:54:14,210
Am I supposed to be sweet?
I'm a little.

3896
02:54:14,490 --> 02:54:18,140
My bedding don't know.
aggressive,

3897
02:54:19,390 --> 02:54:20,223
you've never seen a small deal,
you've ever seen a small thing until 

3898
02:54:22,361 --> 02:54:24,550
you've gone to a korean bath houses.
oh,

3899
02:54:24,600 --> 02:54:26,200
will you try and say,
is that racist?

3900
02:54:26,590 --> 02:54:27,970
No,
it's science.

3901
02:54:27,970 --> 02:54:29,890
Does it smell like kimchi?
You know,

3902
02:54:30,550 --> 02:54:33,550
all kinds of things.
All kinds of dicks at these places.

3903
02:54:33,580 --> 02:54:37,780
ramen noodles is like japanese isn't the
wrong race yesterday,

3904
02:54:37,810 --> 02:54:39,670
man.
It's fucking tiny.

3905
02:54:39,880 --> 02:54:42,820
But before you put your daughter in the 
cryotherapy chamber,

3906
02:54:42,940 --> 02:54:45,580
did you ever just have her take ice bath
and did it help?

3907
02:54:45,900 --> 02:54:47,050
Uh,
we put ice on her before,

3908
02:54:47,051 --> 02:54:48,790
but she was two and a half when she got 
diagnosed.

3909
02:54:50,640 --> 02:54:51,473
She didn't like ice,
but then we're also getting things like 

3910
02:54:53,561 --> 02:54:57,660
the hyperbaric chambers.
So kNow with her ailment or disease,

3911
02:54:57,860 --> 02:54:58,693
you know,
if she hasn't had a flare up in a long 

3912
02:54:59,951 --> 02:55:01,930
time,
it's because we feed her the right food.

3913
02:55:02,140 --> 02:55:03,800
She's gluten free.
Sugar free.

3914
02:55:03,801 --> 02:55:04,430
The hyperbaric

3915
02:55:04,430 --> 02:55:06,140
chamber help where I haven't put it on 
one yet.

3916
02:55:06,141 --> 02:55:07,170
I haven't,
I haven't gotten one yet,

3917
02:55:07,171 --> 02:55:09,410
but I'm getting the adjuStments that 
you've made in the diet.

3918
02:55:09,440 --> 02:55:10,273
They've had a pretty big impact.
Having a low inflammatory food diet is 

3919
02:55:14,580 --> 02:55:17,450
has first.
So she was running by 10 months,

3920
02:55:18,160 --> 02:55:19,760
I mean she was,
she's ahead of the curve,

3921
02:55:19,761 --> 02:55:20,594
really smart.
Then to see her not being able to walk 

3922
02:55:22,670 --> 02:55:25,330
or a little kid having brain fog that 
comes with,

3923
02:55:25,400 --> 02:55:28,550
with ra and I mean I,
I,

3924
02:55:29,060 --> 02:55:30,830
I was a mess,
you know,

3925
02:55:30,890 --> 02:55:31,723
and she can agenda but skew it.
And then finally we started to do all 

3926
02:55:33,561 --> 02:55:34,400
the,
all the food,

3927
02:55:34,670 --> 02:55:37,940
the food has changed and now she's w we 
fixed her quickly,

3928
02:55:37,941 --> 02:55:42,020
we got on it right away and she's okay 
now she's good days.

3929
02:55:42,021 --> 02:55:43,950
And you wouldn't notice it or you would 
have no idea.

3930
02:55:44,830 --> 02:55:48,140
I mean there'S no more.
She was limping a bit with sad,

3931
02:55:48,141 --> 02:55:52,760
funny I guess whatever she got diagnosed
when I tore my hip.

3932
02:55:53,000 --> 02:55:53,833
So we're botH limping around the house 
and limping around disneyland and 

3933
02:55:56,301 --> 02:55:57,134
limping around everywhere.
But I think it maybe kind of made her 

3934
02:55:58,731 --> 02:56:00,410
feel better.
So what,

3935
02:56:00,560 --> 02:56:03,350
what did,
what did you dairy free,

3936
02:56:03,440 --> 02:56:05,180
gluten free,
processed sugar,

3937
02:56:05,181 --> 02:56:06,014
free processed sugar free.
And how long did it take before he saw 

3938
02:56:08,271 --> 02:56:09,104
an impact?

3939
02:56:09,930 --> 02:56:10,763
Not long.
It took maybe a montH or two and then 

3940
02:56:14,011 --> 02:56:16,350
after six months fast.
I mean six months.

3941
02:56:16,351 --> 02:56:20,930
It was huge.
After a year it was gigantic.

3942
02:56:20,931 --> 02:56:21,930
Now what else you do?
What?

3943
02:56:22,080 --> 02:56:23,190
Do you give her?
Any supplements,

3944
02:56:23,191 --> 02:56:25,620
fish oil or anything along those lines?
Yeah,

3945
02:56:25,621 --> 02:56:28,010
I mean we mix in things like,
you know,

3946
02:56:28,011 --> 02:56:31,860
a mct oil or all this health stuff.
My family is very healthy.

3947
02:56:31,890 --> 02:56:32,723
My dad is.
My dad is the one that has kept this 

3948
02:56:34,621 --> 02:56:36,540
diet from falling apart.
Realistically.

3949
02:56:36,541 --> 02:56:38,100
I call them enough food nazi,
but he's,

3950
02:56:39,120 --> 02:56:39,953
you know,
it's me and him raising my daughter 

3951
02:56:40,531 --> 02:56:41,364
together.
Actually my mom just moved into my 

3952
02:56:42,781 --> 02:56:43,614
house.
My parents had been together for 15 

3953
02:56:44,281 --> 02:56:45,540
years,
but they're together now.

3954
02:56:45,600 --> 02:56:47,760
Now.
Now they live together and I lived there

3955
02:56:47,761 --> 02:56:48,630
and I'm like,
oh cool.

3956
02:56:48,631 --> 02:56:50,070
I live with my parents and my kid

3957
02:56:50,140 --> 02:56:51,260
after.
No,

3958
02:56:51,460 --> 02:56:54,730
I love that.
It's a cluster fuck.

3959
02:56:54,760 --> 02:56:56,990
but I love him for it and then I,
you know,

3960
02:56:57,340 --> 02:56:59,080
that's awesome.
So they're doing that to help you?

3961
02:56:59,150 --> 02:56:59,983
Yeah.
That's cool.

3962
02:57:00,130 --> 02:57:01,530
That's beautiful.
And my mom

3963
02:57:01,560 --> 02:57:03,630
as a chef,
my dad's a very healthy guy,

3964
02:57:03,631 --> 02:57:08,070
so the food in my house is all geared 
around my daughter.

3965
02:57:08,071 --> 02:57:10,680
IF I want to cheat on my diet,
I have to leave my house,

3966
02:57:11,270 --> 02:57:13,920
I have to feel bad and I have to just 
sit in my car and cry.

3967
02:57:13,930 --> 02:57:15,810
We're going to go through some gummy 
bears.

3968
02:57:17,940 --> 02:57:21,240
That's great man.
It's great that you could find something

3969
02:57:21,241 --> 02:57:24,840
that quick that can make that big of an 
impact and like I said,

3970
02:57:24,960 --> 02:57:26,640
this,
this diet that I'm on,

3971
02:57:26,680 --> 02:57:27,513
it makes me really considered the impact
that food has on your body and this is 

3972
02:57:31,070 --> 02:57:33,480
one of the reasons why I'm so harsh on 
that chris christie guys,

3973
02:57:33,481 --> 02:57:34,314
because I don't want anybody that's a 
representative of the unIted states or 

3974
02:57:38,010 --> 02:57:42,240
us or a leader that shows the populist,
which shows this,

3975
02:57:42,460 --> 02:57:45,660
this willingness to give it.
I want that to them to be exceptional.

3976
02:57:45,661 --> 02:57:47,840
If you want to be super girl,
exactly superhero.

3977
02:57:47,910 --> 02:57:48,743
That's having some discipline and 
understanding that there's some severe 

3978
02:57:52,711 --> 02:57:53,544
consequences to not having that 
discipline and when you're a massively 

3979
02:57:57,091 --> 02:57:59,970
overweight guy like that.
The amount of aches and pains.

3980
02:57:59,980 --> 02:58:01,470
Our whole motto.
Yeah.

3981
02:58:01,471 --> 02:58:05,400
So when kids look up to and they see 
this fat ass being the leader and like,

3982
02:58:05,401 --> 02:58:06,390
well,
you know,

3983
02:58:06,690 --> 02:58:07,523
it's just amazing that a young girl who 
developed this horrible ailment can get 

3984
02:58:13,650 --> 02:58:16,890
relieF so quickly just by adjusting your
food.

3985
02:58:16,890 --> 02:58:18,780
It makes me never want to eat that shit 
again.

3986
02:58:18,990 --> 02:58:19,823
It really does.
It makes me want to cut all that stuff 

3987
02:58:21,421 --> 02:58:23,130
out of my life forever.
I think I mArried,

3988
02:58:23,160 --> 02:58:25,950
if americans learned how to eat,
we wouldn't have like one of the biggest

3989
02:58:25,951 --> 02:58:28,080
issues is always like healthcare and 
stuff like that.

3990
02:58:28,100 --> 02:58:32,910
I wonder how many ailments would not be 
a factor if people ate better.

3991
02:58:33,090 --> 02:58:33,541
Well,
you know,

3992
02:58:33,541 --> 02:58:38,541
I watched this documentary with my kids 
on corn syrup are on syrup and sugar.

3993
02:58:38,911 --> 02:58:39,720
It was,
I forget,

3994
02:58:39,720 --> 02:58:40,553
it's called,
I think it's called that sugar 

3995
02:58:41,161 --> 02:58:41,994
documentary and we went through the 
supermarket and you start grabbing 

3996
02:58:45,511 --> 02:58:48,750
things and looking at how much sugar is 
in everything subsidized for everything.

3997
02:58:48,810 --> 02:58:50,550
Everything.
It's in everything

3998
02:58:51,150 --> 02:58:54,960
and it's,
it's so deeply ingrained in everything.

3999
02:58:54,961 --> 02:58:56,070
We do,
everything we eat,

4000
02:58:56,340 --> 02:58:57,061
sugar,
sugar,

4001
02:58:57,061 --> 02:58:57,700
sugar,
sugar.

4002
02:58:57,700 --> 02:58:59,580
It's know fed up.
That other document you're talking about

4003
02:58:59,610 --> 02:59:01,500
that they point out so many good points.

4004
02:59:02,600 --> 02:59:03,980
That sounded weird,
but

4005
02:59:04,690 --> 02:59:05,940
it all makes sense.
You can.

4006
02:59:05,960 --> 02:59:10,480
You can turn around anything and there's
fucking sugar in it and everything is so

4007
02:59:10,481 --> 02:59:12,340
manipulative time.
You guys had fast food.

4008
02:59:14,140 --> 02:59:14,973
Well,
I haven't had anything anywhere near it 

4009
02:59:16,610 --> 02:59:19,040
in a month,
so I started this diet.

4010
02:59:19,041 --> 02:59:21,050
I was trying to figure out when I 
started I had to go back and look at the

4011
02:59:21,051 --> 02:59:21,884
clock or the calendar rather february.
First was the first day that I started 

4012
02:59:24,771 --> 02:59:26,870
the diet.
Did you have fast food before that knit?

4013
02:59:26,900 --> 02:59:27,681
Well,
yeah.

4014
02:59:27,681 --> 02:59:28,514
I'm sure I did.
I edit katz deli when I was in New York 

4015
02:59:30,470 --> 02:59:33,590
and I decided after I ate that that was 
going to be the last.

4016
02:59:33,810 --> 02:59:35,690
This is going to be my last blow out 
meals.

4017
02:59:35,691 --> 02:59:36,524
I had to pastrami sandwiches at a reuben
and a corned beef sandwich was 

4018
02:59:41,121 --> 02:59:43,190
delicious.
You don't miss the.

4019
02:59:43,400 --> 02:59:44,300
Nope.
Nope.

4020
02:59:44,450 --> 02:59:46,640
I'm good for one or two.
I could eat it,

4021
02:59:47,480 --> 02:59:48,313
but I don't want to know man.
The benefits are for a little bit of 

4022
02:59:51,051 --> 02:59:51,884
mouth.
Pleasure.

4023
02:59:51,950 --> 02:59:52,701
Here's the thing,
dude.

4024
02:59:52,701 --> 02:59:52,970
You know what?

4025
02:59:52,970 --> 02:59:56,120
I really like,
I like steak come in fat,

4026
02:59:56,180 --> 02:59:59,660
fucking juicy elk stake that.
I cook on the grill.

4027
02:59:59,870 --> 03:00:01,550
I like greens,
la,

4028
03:00:01,551 --> 03:00:04,870
grow healthy food.
That's what I like when I sit down and I

4029
03:00:04,880 --> 03:00:08,510
eat like a nice elk steak with some 
fucking kael feel good,

4030
03:00:08,511 --> 03:00:10,170
feel great.
That's what I like.

4031
03:00:10,190 --> 03:00:11,720
That's what I crave.
I enjoy that.

4032
03:00:11,721 --> 03:00:12,554
That's my favorite kind of meal.
How long did it get you to take out 

4033
03:00:15,020 --> 03:00:17,090
carbs for you?
Felt like that dude.

4034
03:00:17,091 --> 03:00:17,871
I'll tell you what,
man.

4035
03:00:17,871 --> 03:00:19,760
I got a headache the first couple of 
days.

4036
03:00:19,910 --> 03:00:21,220
That was weird.
Um,

4037
03:00:21,460 --> 03:00:24,410
where my body was like,
I hate to use the word detoxing.

4038
03:00:24,470 --> 03:00:27,800
Withdrawals going through detoxing man.
He talks to me,

4039
03:00:27,801 --> 03:00:30,620
but that's what was going on.
It was sugar,

4040
03:00:30,750 --> 03:00:33,620
sugar.
The sugar I think was the headache thing

4041
03:00:33,770 --> 03:00:35,870
because I'd cut out sugar before and I 
got a headache.

4042
03:00:36,350 --> 03:00:39,290
I think that's what it is.
And then you drink on this at all?

4043
03:00:39,640 --> 03:00:42,110
They can have a little,
but I haven't been.

4044
03:00:42,140 --> 03:00:44,060
You were tried cutting out caffeine.
Coffee?

4045
03:00:44,570 --> 03:00:47,200
yeah,
I tried to slas.

4046
03:00:48,900 --> 03:00:52,820
SHivering.
I love when I write,

4047
03:00:53,180 --> 03:00:54,790
when I write,
like really sit down.

4048
03:00:54,830 --> 03:00:57,410
I'm trying to finish something.
I drink wAy too much.

4049
03:00:57,411 --> 03:01:01,570
Graphene and I took some time off after 
last time I did,

4050
03:01:01,571 --> 03:01:02,404
it was a long time ago and last time I 
went on like a real binge where I was 

4051
03:01:07,301 --> 03:01:10,480
just drinking coffee all day everyday 
for like a month.

4052
03:01:10,481 --> 03:01:11,314
That Would be today and then I went like
just one or two days off in my head was 

4053
03:01:15,191 --> 03:01:16,630
killing me.
Just like,

4054
03:01:16,750 --> 03:01:18,370
oh,
it was in a vice.

4055
03:01:18,970 --> 03:01:20,120
That was worse.
Mom,

4056
03:01:20,420 --> 03:01:22,570
it was probably like right up there with
the sugar thing.

4057
03:01:22,600 --> 03:01:26,120
The sugar thing was like for three days,
two or three days I was fogged.

4058
03:01:26,130 --> 03:01:28,070
Sugar would be a big hurt,
no one.

4059
03:01:28,360 --> 03:01:32,350
Here's another big hurdle when you 
convert from your body,

4060
03:01:32,470 --> 03:01:33,303
eating mostly carbs and using that for 
fuel to trying to go into ketosis and 

4061
03:01:39,191 --> 03:01:42,400
burn fat for fuel.
You feel like a bitch like your week?

4062
03:01:42,580 --> 03:01:45,070
Like when I go to the gym,
when I'm lifting weights,

4063
03:01:45,071 --> 03:01:46,720
I'm trying to push like,
oh,

4064
03:01:46,950 --> 03:01:48,940
you still feel that way or he didn't 
know gone.

4065
03:01:49,060 --> 03:01:50,040
It's gone.
I worked out today.

4066
03:01:50,041 --> 03:01:52,330
I felt great,
but the push part,

4067
03:01:52,750 --> 03:01:53,583
the beginning,
like it's hard to get through things so 

4068
03:01:55,971 --> 03:01:58,000
I can decision,
but you have to have discipline.

4069
03:01:58,001 --> 03:01:59,200
This is what you gotta do,
man.

4070
03:01:59,380 --> 03:02:00,213
You got to write.
I didn't write this down because I mean 

4071
03:02:01,810 --> 03:02:03,570
I knew I wasn't going to cheat.
I just like,

4072
03:02:03,580 --> 03:02:04,413
this is how.
This is what I'm going to do this I'm 

4073
03:02:05,711 --> 03:02:08,230
doing and so I did it,
but if you don't,

4074
03:02:08,470 --> 03:02:11,800
if you don't have that mindset or you're
not used to doing that kind of thing,

4075
03:02:12,010 --> 03:02:12,880
just write it down.

4076
03:02:13,090 --> 03:02:14,770
Write down what you're going to do 
today.

4077
03:02:14,800 --> 03:02:16,000
Today,
I'm not going to eat sugar.

4078
03:02:16,030 --> 03:02:17,210
I'm not going to eat carbs.
I'm not gonna.

4079
03:02:17,230 --> 03:02:21,400
Eat that and write that down every 
goddamn day and then check it off at the

4080
03:02:21,400 --> 03:02:22,690
end of the day.
That way you know you did it.

4081
03:02:23,080 --> 03:02:27,340
If you just leave it to like the ether,
just put it out there and just,

4082
03:02:27,350 --> 03:02:27,950
you know,
indian,

4083
03:02:27,950 --> 03:02:30,610
y'all wishy washy with it.
You're not going to be disciplined.

4084
03:02:30,640 --> 03:02:32,650
You just know it's so.
It's not an option.

4085
03:02:32,980 --> 03:02:33,813
So like I told you,
I had that dream and I was eating bread 

4086
03:02:36,550 --> 03:02:37,780
was dreaming.
I was like,

4087
03:02:37,781 --> 03:02:38,614
but it was only cornbread.
I had a dream that doesn't like 

4088
03:02:40,160 --> 03:02:41,710
cornbread.
I had a dream.

4089
03:02:41,711 --> 03:02:45,040
I was different kinds of bread and 
butter was another one was like a,

4090
03:02:45,180 --> 03:02:48,070
like a cheesy roles.
You get it like fogo de chao,

4091
03:02:48,480 --> 03:02:49,100
those,
those,

4092
03:02:49,100 --> 03:02:54,100
the warm cheesy rules this gets.
I'm having a fucking red lobster,

4093
03:02:57,810 --> 03:02:59,740
red lobster,
but it'll just hanging out in Brazil,

4094
03:02:59,741 --> 03:03:02,110
walking around and grabbing those little
bags of cheese balls.

4095
03:03:02,830 --> 03:03:04,120
I never been to Brazil.
Oh,

4096
03:03:04,121 --> 03:03:05,300
you gotta go man.
That's great.

4097
03:03:05,350 --> 03:03:07,210
I give myself 10 years.
I'll look like chris christie.

4098
03:03:08,200 --> 03:03:10,920
You're fine.
But it's just.

4099
03:03:12,950 --> 03:03:16,090
I don't know.
That fat is way,

4100
03:03:16,120 --> 03:03:16,953
way,
way lighter than it used to be because 

4101
03:03:18,551 --> 03:03:21,640
you can't get your stomach stapled 
unless you're like fucking.

4102
03:03:21,670 --> 03:03:24,640
Well there was one picture where he's 
just morbidly obese.

4103
03:03:24,850 --> 03:03:27,850
That was before.
That was after his surgery.

4104
03:03:27,880 --> 03:03:31,770
I want that as my friend president where
he's wearing those pants.

4105
03:03:31,810 --> 03:03:33,280
Yeah.
I have a lot of fat friends.

4106
03:03:33,350 --> 03:03:34,600
I mean,
they're awesome.

4107
03:03:34,630 --> 03:03:35,620
Yeah.
Yeah.

4108
03:03:35,710 --> 03:03:37,570
Look,
I've morbidly obese friends.

4109
03:03:37,630 --> 03:03:39,130
It's not the.
That's not the issue.

4110
03:03:39,190 --> 03:03:40,630
No,
I don't have an issue with all that.

4111
03:03:40,631 --> 03:03:41,560
They're fun,
man.

4112
03:03:41,561 --> 03:03:44,260
I wish I was more like them.
It's just like there's a.

4113
03:03:44,261 --> 03:03:49,261
There's a position that is the most 
highly valued position in the world.

4114
03:03:50,560 --> 03:03:52,400
That's the president of the United 
States.

4115
03:03:52,401 --> 03:03:54,780
You got to be an x man.
You got to be a bad motherfucker.

4116
03:03:54,790 --> 03:03:56,750
You demand a lot from your president 
doesn't.

4117
03:03:57,100 --> 03:03:58,070
There's no one like that

4118
03:03:58,070 --> 03:04:00,060
is running right now.
There's no one.

4119
03:04:00,100 --> 03:04:02,440
There's no one fits that bill and that's
why it's so sweet.

4120
03:04:02,500 --> 03:04:06,110
Fit that bill knows damn well they don't
want to be president to smart.

4121
03:04:06,250 --> 03:04:07,083
Well also the fact that you get so you 
get everything about your past gets 

4122
03:04:10,281 --> 03:04:13,910
raked over with a fine tooth comb.
We way over three hours right now are.

4123
03:04:13,911 --> 03:04:15,840
We were way over.
Alright kids.

4124
03:04:16,090 --> 03:04:17,030
Let's.
Thanks chris.

4125
03:04:17,031 --> 03:04:19,540
Christie,
let's wrap this up.

4126
03:04:19,900 --> 03:04:20,780
Up.
There he is.

4127
03:04:20,781 --> 03:04:21,650
Look at that.
Look at that.

4128
03:04:22,340 --> 03:04:24,200
You know,
post surgery.

4129
03:04:24,230 --> 03:04:26,420
By the way.
I thought it was just a big husky guy.

4130
03:04:26,690 --> 03:04:30,830
Come on bro.
He deflated this for upper smart guy.

4131
03:04:31,250 --> 03:04:33,260
no,
that's not even a manly gut.

4132
03:04:33,680 --> 03:04:37,690
Like a manly gut is like joey diaz to 
ideas as a manly cut.

4133
03:04:37,720 --> 03:04:38,553
Can see he.
Can he see his cock you or is it too 

4134
03:04:39,851 --> 03:04:40,960
pushed into the seat of.

4135
03:04:40,970 --> 03:04:42,620
He has a mere strange,
uh,

4136
03:04:43,400 --> 03:04:44,390
insane look,
right?

4137
03:04:44,450 --> 03:04:46,440
He looks comfortable.
It looks comfortable.

4138
03:04:46,970 --> 03:04:49,330
Lounge chair.
Like somebody just put a bunch of car.

4139
03:04:49,500 --> 03:04:52,620
Does she looks comfortable.
Warren cheese.
