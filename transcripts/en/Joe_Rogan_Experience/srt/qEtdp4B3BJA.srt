1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,670
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:03,650
What do you think about
these old banning bossy,

3
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:04,910
retarded.

4
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:05,301
Stupid.

5
00:00:05,301 --> 00:00:06,380
It's never going to work,

6
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:07,910
but to me it makes me angry.

7
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:10,550
It makes me angry that you're pretending
that someone's feelings are hurt

8
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:12,140
because you have the word bossy.

9
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:14,910
Bossy means leadership.

10
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:16,200
It doesn't like,

11
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,330
I have a few naces and I
want to say which of them.

12
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,870
One of them's bit bossy
and what I mean bossy.

13
00:00:21,871 --> 00:00:22,950
It's not like she goes,

14
00:00:22,951 --> 00:00:23,251
okay,

15
00:00:23,251 --> 00:00:23,851
you sit over here,

16
00:00:23,851 --> 00:00:24,760
we're playing this game.

17
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:25,561
She's like,

18
00:00:25,561 --> 00:00:26,251
don't touch that.

19
00:00:26,251 --> 00:00:27,090
That's my toy.

20
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,520
She's just a bit of a cunt.

21
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,393
Yeah,

22
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,540
they don't like Conti.

23
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,460
So they're trying to get rid of Bossy,

24
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:33,960
which is a substitute for country.

25
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,960
They're trying to remove
themselves from criticism.

26
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:38,580
Nobody was coming up with that.

27
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,960
They're either trying to silence free
speech or they're trying to remove what

28
00:00:42,961 --> 00:00:46,680
they think is criticism and
they faced many times and it's,

29
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:47,011
you know,

30
00:00:47,011 --> 00:00:47,641
a lot of them.

31
00:00:47,641 --> 00:00:48,510
Like what?

32
00:00:48,511 --> 00:00:49,321
Where's it coming from?

33
00:00:49,321 --> 00:00:50,550
Most likely feminists and well,

34
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:51,540
what are a lot of feminists?

35
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:55,800
A lot of feminists are very strong women
who like being able to tell people what

36
00:00:55,801 --> 00:00:57,360
the fuck to do and what,

37
00:00:57,361 --> 00:00:58,710
what would be a criticism of that?

38
00:00:58,711 --> 00:00:58,921
Well,

39
00:00:58,921 --> 00:00:59,754
she's a cunt.

40
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,593
She's Conti,

41
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,560
she's bossy.

42
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:02,620
Those are there.

43
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,640
They're all in line with
what's what people don't like.

44
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,870
I will ban Bossy,

45
00:01:06,871 --> 00:01:08,030
get the fuck out.

46
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,060
Famous face you campaign.

47
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,940
But it's the dumbest fucking thing

48
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,440
on their advert or the program.

49
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:15,221
The woman was there going,

50
00:01:15,221 --> 00:01:19,780
do you know that men earn
99% of the world's property?

51
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,213
Right.

52
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:21,821
And I,

53
00:01:21,821 --> 00:01:22,654
and then I,

54
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,793
I thought about,

55
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:27,250
do you know 95% of the
homeless are also men.

56
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:32,710
There's plenty of Bossy bitches kicking
cans out of the houses are living,

57
00:01:32,711 --> 00:01:33,544
rent free,

58
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:34,920
are nice guy.

59
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:36,340
All you ban Bossy,

60
00:01:36,341 --> 00:01:38,140
you won't get women that
are heads of corporations.

61
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,250
Most bossy women that I've known
in my life don't have jobs.

62
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,233
Yeah.

63
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:46,420
And probably would never get to the head
of a corporation because that requires

64
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:47,560
a lot of people skills.

65
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:49,060
It's not like they've been held back,

66
00:01:49,061 --> 00:01:49,600
bicycling,

67
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,290
Bossy,

68
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:53,200
I'm there paying the rent and they
still fucking bossing me around.

69
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:53,920
You know,

70
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,150
it doesn't feel like,

71
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:56,310
yeah,

72
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,100
no,

73
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,480
the idea is ridiculous.

74
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:01,570
The idea that all these women want to
have fucking want to be the head of

75
00:02:01,571 --> 00:02:03,190
corporations is ridiculous too.

76
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,080
A lot of women don't
want those jobs either.

77
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,910
They're not working towards those jobs.

78
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:09,670
The idea that they're completely
banned from those jobs.

79
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:12,220
There are women out there
who run corporations.

80
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,143
Is it fair?

81
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:14,140
I'm not saying it is,

82
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,970
but there's a lot of shit that's not fair,

83
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,100
but life isn't it?

84
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:22,640
Well there's a good chance we'll have
a female president next or soon as

85
00:02:22,641 --> 00:02:23,474
possible.

86
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:27,890
There's just very different
characteristics that men
have and women have is very

87
00:02:27,891 --> 00:02:28,790
different personalities,

88
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:32,240
almost inherent to having testosterone
and a dick that you don't have.

89
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:34,680
Also with the woman,

90
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:38,820
and this is nothing against
women when they have a kid.

91
00:02:38,821 --> 00:02:41,100
I'm not saying cause they take
nine months out of the workplace,

92
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,240
although it's probably a problem,

93
00:02:42,241 --> 00:02:43,110
but I didn't give a fuck.

94
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,610
When they have a kid,

95
00:02:44,611 --> 00:02:46,380
their mind does change a little bit.

96
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,740
They become less career
driven for a lot of them.

97
00:02:49,741 --> 00:02:50,574
Not all of them,

98
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,170
but they do start going,

99
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:53,920
I want to spend time with this and Dah,

100
00:02:53,921 --> 00:02:54,181
Dah,

101
00:02:54,181 --> 00:02:54,471
Dah.

102
00:02:54,471 --> 00:02:56,940
And then a man has to step up a
little bit more and work a bit.

103
00:02:56,941 --> 00:02:57,450
Huh.

104
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:00,130
I sometimes the garage,

105
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,920
the amount I have to go on the
road and be away from my kids.

106
00:03:03,921 --> 00:03:04,181
So I was,

107
00:03:04,181 --> 00:03:05,440
I can support the family.

108
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:06,581
You know,

109
00:03:06,581 --> 00:03:09,040
I feel like I miss out on something there.

110
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:10,840
I'd rather be home all the time with him.

111
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,471
Right.

112
00:03:11,471 --> 00:03:12,430
I know exactly what you mean.

113
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:13,010
Yeah.

114
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:13,450
Um,

115
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:18,450
I think everyone has a role and that
everyone's role is different depending on

116
00:03:19,151 --> 00:03:19,841
the relationship,

117
00:03:19,841 --> 00:03:21,160
depending on where you are in life,

118
00:03:21,161 --> 00:03:21,994
depending on everything.

119
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,320
But the idea that it would should be
even for men and women is ridiculous.

120
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:28,580
The idea that anything
should be even as ridiculous.

121
00:03:28,581 --> 00:03:28,780
Yeah.

122
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:32,020
The only thing you should
ask is for no discrimination,

123
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:33,760
no discrimination,

124
00:03:33,761 --> 00:03:36,120
and that someone will be pro,

125
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:36,551
they were there,

126
00:03:36,551 --> 00:03:40,060
there'd be promoted based entirely
on how well they do what they do.

127
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,260
Like the idea that,

128
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:41,561
yeah,

129
00:03:41,561 --> 00:03:44,920
but the idea that like there should
be an equal amount of men in an equal,

130
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,380
a women in the same
position that I don't buy.

131
00:03:47,381 --> 00:03:50,890
That doesn't make any sense to me
because there's a lot of jobs that men do

132
00:03:50,891 --> 00:03:53,620
better than women and a lot of
jobs that women do better than men.

133
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:54,760
It's just a fact.

134
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:59,830
And they've got Beyonce and Congolese
arise and who is the other bird that got a

135
00:03:59,831 --> 00:04:00,371
Giulia?

136
00:04:00,371 --> 00:04:02,380
God is on the campaign as well.

137
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:05,650
And then like Beyonce is day going,

138
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:06,700
going,

139
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,151
uh,

140
00:04:07,151 --> 00:04:07,984
I'm not bossy,

141
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,070
but I am the boss.

142
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:09,963
I'm the queen.

143
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:15,150
What is it with black women and wanting
to be the Queen Queen Latifa men.

144
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:17,050
The coin in the night with men.

145
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:17,913
Men are always the king.

146
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:21,180
Black men like this is a lot of
fighters that call themselves cane

147
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:21,681
black.

148
00:04:21,681 --> 00:04:24,600
All white men will call
themselves the king of the castle.

149
00:04:24,601 --> 00:04:25,670
I'm the king in my home.

150
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,500
That's a universal mile thing.

151
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:28,400
We want to be the king.

152
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:33,050
Black women want to be queens and
watch six want to be princesses.

153
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:34,610
It's true,

154
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:35,120
right?

155
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,320
They don't even want to be Queens.

156
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,610
The autonomy to child,

157
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:41,780
the only white chick that wants
to be the queen is the queen.

158
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,390
That's probably at right every,

159
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:45,810
every time you made a girl,

160
00:04:45,811 --> 00:04:46,031
it's a,

161
00:04:46,031 --> 00:04:49,280
I want a bit of a princess because
they want to be taken care of and black

162
00:04:49,281 --> 00:04:50,010
chicks are like,

163
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:51,820
I want to fucking own Yukon.

164
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,513
I'm the,

165
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:55,550
I'm the queen.

166
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:57,930
Well that was the thing
that black men like the,

167
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:00,560
there was a big thing they
used to say it was that the,

168
00:05:00,561 --> 00:05:01,770
we used to be kings,

169
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:02,341
you know,

170
00:05:02,341 --> 00:05:03,720
black man used to be kings.

171
00:05:03,721 --> 00:05:03,931
You know,

172
00:05:03,931 --> 00:05:05,070
before we were slaves were king

173
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,460
because in Africa the Isley I little
villages and they didn't travel very far.

174
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:16,590
It was easy to be a king
when the population was 10
and it was you and the other

175
00:05:16,591 --> 00:05:17,520
hot and you're like,

176
00:05:17,521 --> 00:05:22,380
I'm Queen [inaudible] or whatever and
fucking you go out with your spear and you

177
00:05:22,381 --> 00:05:22,591
think,

178
00:05:22,591 --> 00:05:23,950
oh I'm the king of this little tea.

179
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,601
Cause it's still,

180
00:05:24,601 --> 00:05:28,990
now they've got guys that
are driving taxis in the UK.

181
00:05:28,991 --> 00:05:30,630
It was like I'm Prince of Dubai.

182
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:31,800
Bubububuh right.

183
00:05:31,801 --> 00:05:32,281
And you're like,

184
00:05:32,281 --> 00:05:36,090
I'm fourth in line for the throne and
there's so many fucking kings over there.

185
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,061
That's hilarious.

186
00:05:37,061 --> 00:05:37,811
And it's so true.

187
00:05:37,811 --> 00:05:40,040
If you really stop and
think about it like the,

188
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:40,390
the,

189
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:43,450
the amount of people that's
probably directly in line.

190
00:05:43,451 --> 00:05:45,760
We were talking about and we
were talking about being famous,

191
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:48,610
that you don't want to be the
king of a place that's too big.

192
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,210
Yeah.

193
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:49,451
You know,

194
00:05:49,451 --> 00:05:50,284
like you don't want to be the,

195
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,610
you don't know either had a Rome,

196
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,020
there's too much shit going on.

197
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:56,710
Even all these other countries should be
able to overthrow you too much stress.

198
00:05:56,711 --> 00:05:58,070
Everybody's to kill you all

199
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,760
the time.

200
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,770
But if you're the king of
a fucking small village,

201
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:01,740
like you probably do,

202
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:02,573
I'm pretty good.

203
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,740
You get all the fish.

204
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,031
Yeah,

205
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:04,700
you're good.

206
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,200
You got,

207
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:05,630
you know,

208
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,370
10 wives or whatever the hell you need.

209
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:10,820
You can get gold wives occasionally you
can go over to a guy's house and just

210
00:06:10,821 --> 00:06:11,654
take a goat.

211
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:12,771
Yeah.

212
00:06:12,771 --> 00:06:13,430
It's a,

213
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:15,080
it's a tribute has to pay.

214
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,360
But if you like to head of England,

215
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,220
God damn is a lot of pressure on you.

216
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:19,690
Well,

217
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:20,840
the King Ralph.

218
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:21,051
Yeah,

219
00:06:21,051 --> 00:06:21,950
that was a good film.

220
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:22,771
I love it.

221
00:06:22,771 --> 00:06:26,780
You know what I like about King Ralph
King Graph is a movie where you know

222
00:06:26,781 --> 00:06:27,980
they've worked backwards.

223
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,240
They've got all right,

224
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,400
this is the prep because
you've got with movie ideas,

225
00:06:31,401 --> 00:06:32,530
whenever you go and move your ideas,

226
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,920
you think of just the broad strokes,

227
00:06:33,921 --> 00:06:34,754
so someone's going,

228
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,010
okay,

229
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:39,740
in American guy is the king of England
and he's a Slob and he likes 10 pin

230
00:06:39,741 --> 00:06:40,160
bowling.

231
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:40,400
All right,

232
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,270
that's what I've got,

233
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,220
and then another guy's gone.

234
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,840
How do we get rid of the royal family?

235
00:06:44,841 --> 00:06:45,231
I'm fuck.

236
00:06:45,231 --> 00:06:45,890
I'm thinking,

237
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:46,700
all right,

238
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,330
and then what happens?

239
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:47,660
Gone.

240
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,493
I've got it.

241
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,770
They're all standing in a
puddle and get electric.

242
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:54,810
They're all still at,

243
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:58,040
they take a photo of the
entire or family at once.

244
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,440
[inaudible] standing in a bit of water,

245
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:01,310
the camera goes,

246
00:07:01,311 --> 00:07:01,820
falls over,

247
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:02,091
light,

248
00:07:02,091 --> 00:07:04,160
falls into the panel and
they all get electric,

249
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:04,851
electrified.

250
00:07:04,851 --> 00:07:06,490
The death electrified,

251
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:07,453
electrocuted,

252
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:11,600
and then obviously they
go through all the family.

253
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:16,010
They can't find a single relative until
they find a fat guy from Milwaukee

254
00:07:16,011 --> 00:07:16,844
called Ralph.

255
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:18,050
I don't know if he was from your walkie.

256
00:07:18,051 --> 00:07:20,140
It sounds like he was king graph.

257
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:30,120
Okay.
