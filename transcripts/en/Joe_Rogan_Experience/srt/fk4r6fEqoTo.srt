00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:01,443
Hey Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.
Don't fight over like two and three 

2
00:00:06,241 --> 00:00:07,310
pounds.
It's crazy.

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,570
I can make the weight different than 
MMA.

4
00:00:09,571 --> 00:00:11,010
In that regard.
MMA,

5
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:13,650
you're dealing with a firm middleweight 
to light heavyweight,

6
00:00:13,651 --> 00:00:17,280
which guys jumped back and forth.
You're dealing with 20 fucking pounds.

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,560
I mean,
that's madness.

8
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:20,340
I think there should be more awake 
classes.

9
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:22,950
Yeah,
I've been saying this from the jump.

10
00:00:22,951 --> 00:00:25,650
There should be a weight class every 10 
pounds and they're like,

11
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:26,730
well,
if there's too many champions,

12
00:00:26,731 --> 00:00:29,250
it waters down.
I completely disagree.

13
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:30,203
You're telling me some of these amazing 
fighters that you have that are 

14
00:00:32,611 --> 00:00:34,440
superstars,
like a donald cerrone,

15
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,240
like a Diego Sanchez,
like all these different guys,

16
00:00:37,241 --> 00:00:38,074
so it was just so amazing.
Guys that never won a title that are 

17
00:00:39,751 --> 00:00:41,490
huge fan favorites,
right?

18
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,340
If you look at all these different guys,
uriah faber and other ones,

19
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,293
you're telling me those guys couldn't 
have been champions and you wouldn't 

20
00:00:47,311 --> 00:00:51,150
have had even more champions and an even
crazier thing if there were.

21
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,120
If there was a weight class every 10 
pounds and a better product,

22
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,500
you're getting better performances 
because Donald's not destroying his body

23
00:00:58,501 --> 00:00:59,334
and make 55.
You're not having these monsters make 

24
00:01:00,571 --> 00:01:03,510
these weight classes and the actual 
world champions.

25
00:01:03,511 --> 00:01:07,850
There's the sponsorship classes.
Two.

26
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:08,621
Oh six,
two,

27
00:01:08,621 --> 00:01:10,220
two 65.
How dare you?

28
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:11,520
It's crazy.
It's crazy.

29
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:13,303
It's crazy to to it.
But what's interesting is the best guy 

30
00:01:16,161 --> 00:01:21,161
seemed to like flatten out around 2:42.
So my thought is let's make a to 40.

31
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:22,283
Let's make that heavyweight and then two
to to to 40 to 65 or a little champions 

32
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:31,410
the better or all the way up.
The only time you can't.

33
00:01:31,411 --> 00:01:36,090
It's like a little bit of a problem.
A problem is with Cyborg,

34
00:01:36,091 --> 00:01:37,530
right?
Because she's like,

35
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:39,450
she goes,
I'll fight anyone at 1:40,

36
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,180
but at 1:40
I heard from my source,

37
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,590
it was a beast for her to get to.

38
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:46,770
I think she's the 1:45
pound invicta champion.

39
00:01:46,771 --> 00:01:48,480
They have a 1:35
in the UFC.

40
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:53,980
One 45 and I think you can do one for d,
But why do it?

41
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,950
Why make her make it?
She's the 1:45

42
00:01:55,951 --> 00:01:57,210
pound champ.
I know,

43
00:01:57,211 --> 00:01:59,970
but there's not a lot of all the 
superstars at 1:35

44
00:01:59,971 --> 00:02:02,760
can make 1:40
to make him put on 10 pounds.

45
00:02:02,761 --> 00:02:05,070
Ever build it.
They will come.

46
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:05,963
However,
if I would say right now Mr Rowe 

47
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,233
breakdown right now.
You understand she's the invicta 

48
00:02:10,591 --> 00:02:12,450
champion,
so she's fighting people in Invicta.

49
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,920
Hey,
yeah,

50
00:02:13,921 --> 00:02:14,754
look,
it's true.

51
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,190
She's better than all of them anyway.
It doesn't matter,

52
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:19,740
but you shouldn't be forcing her to kill
herself.

53
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:21,510
When 1:45
is already established.

54
00:02:21,511 --> 00:02:23,490
Weight class.
Misha tate was the 1:45

55
00:02:23,491 --> 00:02:24,630
pound champion.
Strikeforce.

56
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:25,483
It's good point.
Established way that you would fight or 

57
00:02:27,061 --> 00:02:29,520
two w.
it's an established weight class I think

58
00:02:29,521 --> 00:02:30,630
at 1:40
though.

59
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:31,643
Well listen,
Holly Holmes fought people in boxing as 

60
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,520
high as 1:52,
but 1:45

61
00:02:35,521 --> 00:02:38,030
and established way closed.
Sign up the house.

62
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,700
How does Holly Holm Doing Cyborg?
I matched his.

63
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,010
She has the best chance,
right?

64
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:48,960
Because Cyborg is a ruthless marauder.
She's like a preserve or a tower shoot.

65
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:50,700
The box style.
Not this last fight.

66
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:55,320
No more tech related and those hits.
I was like,

67
00:02:55,321 --> 00:02:56,154
Oh shit.
That counter right hand on the counter 

68
00:02:58,801 --> 00:03:00,540
right hands now.
So Leslie Hicks,

69
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,770
the mastercard.
Nice hard.

70
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:03,980
Of course she's mad.
Establish.

71
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,200
She's a beast.
She should be.

72
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:07,190
She should be celebrating that stuff and
she should.

73
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:10,420
She should definitely thank the referee.
The referee saved her from herself.

74
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:12,490
Yes,
but she just so tough fighter.

75
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,310
She's so tough.
She wanted to go out on our shield,

76
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,530
but she was already gone.
She doesn't understand ground and pound.

77
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:21,910
That shit is ill fate or days.

78
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:26,380
She was punching him in the face.
She's so much more advanced than anybody

79
00:03:26,381 --> 00:03:27,181
else.
Crazy.

80
00:03:27,181 --> 00:03:29,880
So much more.
And Get up to Perillo.

81
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:32,600
Well,
she's different than holly completely.

82
00:03:32,601 --> 00:03:33,434
Holly is a counter striker and holly 
also had a really brutal knockout in 

83
00:03:37,211 --> 00:03:40,450
boxing against a larger woman and have 
watched it.

84
00:03:40,451 --> 00:03:41,590
I was like,
whoa.

85
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,753
Is the kind of knock out that you never 
really fight that way again because you 

86
00:03:46,691 --> 00:03:49,750
realize the consequences now,
like someone gets brutally,

87
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:50,584
brutally knocked out.
They're aware of that as a consequence 

88
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:57,100
and I think she's become much more of a 
defensive minded counter striker,

89
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:00,220
which was super effective against Rhonda
or better I think for her.

90
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,073
Right.
But it didn't look so good against 

91
00:04:01,751 --> 00:04:04,540
Meesha because Misha was fighting super 
smart,

92
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:07,240
but it was also.
Well,

93
00:04:07,241 --> 00:04:12,241
it's also because Meesha doesn't brush 
after hiring stanley outside flat.

94
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,370
Amazing blast.
So for whatever reason,

95
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,260
holly didn't fight like herself.

96
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,730
She doesn't like,
it was like pulling the trigger.

97
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,820
She doesn't like to lead to lead and 
she's worried about being taken down.

98
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,833
When she got taken down by me,
should we realized why she doesn't like 

99
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:25,150
delete?
Correct.

100
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:27,070
They should took her down,
beat the shit out of her on the ground,

101
00:04:27,071 --> 00:04:29,860
like destroyed her.
And that second round was on top of,

102
00:04:29,861 --> 00:04:31,840
or most of the rounds just beating her 
ass.

103
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,370
And so we knew,
look of me,

104
00:04:33,371 --> 00:04:34,600
she gets her down,
she's fucked.

105
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,553
So then she fights like a,
like a craftsman to third and fourth 

106
00:04:38,381 --> 00:04:39,161
round.
She just fights.

107
00:04:39,161 --> 00:04:42,070
Real smarts isn't the outside edges,
those rounds.

108
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:42,993
And then me,
she's forced to go for broke and the 

109
00:04:44,081 --> 00:04:46,930
fifth and Meesha want up taking her out 
and choking her out story,

110
00:04:46,931 --> 00:04:47,764
man.
So.

111
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:51,910
But here's the thing.
Cyborgs way better on the ground.

112
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:57,120
I mean way better on the ground and 
strong way better way,

113
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,830
way better,
way better.

114
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:02,530
Cyborg wind,
straight Jujitsu competitions.

115
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:05,850
She is fucking strongest.
Your fucking face.

116
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:09,930
Suplexes she just made she rampage 
dallen bitch.

117
00:05:09,931 --> 00:05:12,130
And she gets on top of you.
Oh my God.

118
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:16,270
The her grounded pound.
She looks like a panther.

119
00:05:16,271 --> 00:05:17,104
Like she looks like.
It's almost like she was put on earth 

120
00:05:18,971 --> 00:05:19,840
for one thing.
Like,

121
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:21,640
well when she's in that ring,
that cage,

122
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,830
you're just doing shit to.
You beat her.

123
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:24,610
Yeah.
She's,

124
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:25,443
she's built herself into that.
Taking so long for her to finally get 

125
00:05:28,781 --> 00:05:30,820
her.
Now she's here and everyone's like,

126
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,140
God.
And even when she's here,

127
00:05:32,141 --> 00:05:33,940
man,
they did it in Brazil and they did it at

128
00:05:33,941 --> 00:05:35,200
1:42.
They made her suffer.

129
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:36,303
I would have my personal choice.
I would have had the first ever 145 

130
00:05:39,521 --> 00:05:40,354
pound fight in the UFC.
Led a bunch of people sign up to be who 

131
00:05:43,631 --> 00:05:44,464
wants to,
who wants to get in there and he knows 

132
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:48,010
that my man,
but that's the price,

133
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,410
but I think you've got invicta girls 
that are agreeing to fight her.

134
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,273
So if you've got invicta girls,
they're agreeing to fight are you're 

135
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:54,070
telling me those girls wouldn't take a 
fight in the UFC?

136
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,860
Of course I'm telling no one would care.
Frank doesn't matter.

137
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,700
It's the Cyborg show,
dude.

138
00:05:58,701 --> 00:05:59,534
It's the Cyborg show right now.
This is Mike Tyson versus people that 

139
00:06:02,721 --> 00:06:04,460
you don't know and you don't.
It's turning tubs.

140
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,730
Mike Tyson versus Tony tops.
See,

141
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:08,810
she has a ways to go for.
She's Mike Tyson.

142
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:13,190
She just got introduced to when you went
to see Mike Tyson versus Tony tubs.

143
00:06:13,191 --> 00:06:14,580
Didn't think Tony tubs.
Gonna win.

144
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:16,970
I'm a Tony.
You went to see the Mike Tyson shot?

145
00:06:16,971 --> 00:06:18,780
No,
I was there to see Tony Title,

146
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,480
[inaudible] manager.
And they're like,

147
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:25,760
hey,
we need you to find at 1:45

148
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:27,120
sidebar,
take Misha.

149
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:28,663
Misha would take that ticket.
But everyone else like that in a good 

150
00:06:31,731 --> 00:06:34,240
move that ain't no.
And listen,

151
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:35,330
you know,
Cyborg,

152
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:36,920
like go back to the Gina Carano fight.

153
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,560
Cyborg had problems in that fight so 
people don't understand.

154
00:06:39,561 --> 00:06:43,430
Gina Carano had her mounted.
Giancana was a tough fucking girl.

155
00:06:43,431 --> 00:06:45,410
Hottest variable.
They duked it out.

156
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,840
Gina literally was on top of her head 
are mounted.

157
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:50,120
Cyborg wasn't the same sideboard back 
then,

158
00:06:50,121 --> 00:06:52,940
but sidebar was way more shredded back 
then.

159
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:55,430
She was,
she was like a bodybuilder man.

160
00:06:55,431 --> 00:06:58,760
She's terrifying.
Like just the physical muscular,

161
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,490
the muscularity and the power that she 
had.

162
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,290
There's a picture that I'll never 
forget,

163
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:04,124
man,
is one of,

164
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:09,280
if I have like a list of all my iconic 
memories of photographs in mma,

165
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:14,620
there's one we're Cyborg is grabbing the
head of Gina Carano.

166
00:07:15,111 --> 00:07:15,944
She's got her fingers out,
she's got an MMA glove on with nail 

167
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:19,124
Polish on,
and she's about to punch her in the 

168
00:07:21,111 --> 00:07:21,944
face.
And Gina's phases already fucked up in 

169
00:07:23,781 --> 00:07:25,430
cyborgs.
Holding her head.

170
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,350
I'm not sure about.
There it is right there.

171
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,300
Look at that.
Look at that.

172
00:07:29,301 --> 00:07:32,690
Come on son.
That is an iconic photo.

173
00:07:32,691 --> 00:07:37,020
Look at the eyes,
the cold in the background.

174
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,940
It shows the fucked up shit.
Boom.

175
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,430
She goes to sleep and dropping a right 
hand on her.

176
00:07:43,431 --> 00:07:46,700
Fucking crushing her.
Feel that bitch.

177
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:47,660
Yeah,
and this is,

178
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,450
by the way,
the Cyborg,

179
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,293
the Washington,
but look at the muscles on her fucking 

180
00:07:51,531 --> 00:07:54,440
shoulder and your arm and the Cyborg you
looking at today.

181
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:55,910
But Bitch,
the Cyborg,

182
00:07:55,911 --> 00:07:58,850
you're going to say what?
Fuck this Cyborg up for sure.

183
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:00,240
She's better now.
She's.

184
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,680
She's fucking dedicated,
man.

185
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:03,830
Just doing the damn thing.
