brain or whether it's a hemp protein
powder.

33
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,180
All the things we sell are things that I

00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:37,700
that are interesting.
Um,

36
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,320
all of the supplements have science
behind them.

37
00:01:40,321 --> 00:01:43,770
There's all a sheet with references,
uh,

38
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:47,340

chosen and what the benefits of those

Also brought to you by.

48
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:22,350
Well this episode is brought to you buy
naturebox.

49
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:27,030
Naturebox is my newest addiction around
the office and a lot of people on my

50
00:02:27,031 --> 00:02:29,850
message board.
I had questions about exactly how

51
00:02:29,851 --> 00:02:30,930
healthy it is.
Well,

52
00:02:30,931 --> 00:02:35,060
you can vary it at naturebox.
You could be like a real freak and go,

53
00:02:35,061 --> 00:02:36,300
uh,
the gluten free route,

54
00:02:36,301 --> 00:02:40,320
which is how I did it.
Or you can get a little sketchy with

55
00:02:40,321 --> 00:02:41,400
shit like pretzels.

56
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:44,790
Let's be honest.
It's only you can only make pretzels so

57
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:46,730
healthy.
There's really not a lot you could do to

58
00:02:46,731 --> 00:02:50,490
them that makes them actually healthy.
Pretzels are fucking pretzels man.

59
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:55,860
But what naturebox do have products are
natural and contained a much higher

60
00:02:55,861 --> 00:02:58,260
quality ingredients than the typical
vending machine.

61
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:01,000
Food ingredients there is over 100
snacks.

62
00:03:01,001 --> 00:03:02,800
Choose from.
And if you look for something with

63
00:03:02,801 --> 00:03:04,750
certain dietary needs,
like wheat free,

64
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:07,540
lower sugar content,
etc. They have that too.

65
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:10,780
And whenever possible They try to use
non gmo food as well.

66
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,120
Their products are made from wholesome
ingredients.

67
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:17,110
And nutritionist approve the abide by
very strict quality standards,

68
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:19,300
no high fructose corn syrup,
no pipe,

69
00:03:19,301 --> 00:03:21,760
partially hydrogenated oils,
no trans fats,

70
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,310
no artificial sweeteners,
no artificial colors,

71
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:28,360
no artificial flavors.
So it's wAy healthier than most bullshit

72
00:03:28,361 --> 00:03:29,530
that you're getting from vending
machines.

73
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:30,790
That's the idea behind it.

74
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:36,330
And again you can get it is variable is
like fairly healthy pretzels or what my

75
00:03:36,911 --> 00:03:39,310
favorite really healthy is these things
are delicious,

76
00:03:39,311 --> 00:03:42,370
man.
I got these sweet blueberry almonds.

77
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:45,310
Oh they're so ridiculous.
They're so good.

78
00:03:45,311 --> 00:03:48,730
I ate them all up.
I need more in these plantations are

79
00:03:48,731 --> 00:03:50,660

And these are pretty guilt free,

80
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,180

94
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:38,640

legal things online from the comfort of

95
00:04:39,491 --> 00:04:41,620
your home.

96
00:04:41,621 --> 00:04:44,020
lawyer's office and schedule an
appointment,

97
00:04:44,021 --> 00:04:47,830
it's also accompanied that we have used
brian red bands,

used it.
Arbor used to secure on it and make it

99
00:04:51,131 --> 00:04:53,470

Super easy To do things like that

100
00:04:53,471 --> 00:04:54,970

They guide you through it.

101

They also have third party independent
attorneys that can connect you to,

102
00:04:59,261 --> 00:05:02,560
if you ever get into a panic and think
that you're going to jail because what

103
00:05:02,561 --> 00:05:04,450
you're doing is totally illegal.
They can let you know.

104
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,530
Legal zoom is not a law firm,
but they can connect you with a third

105
00:05:08,531 --> 00:05:10,750
party attorney and provide you with self
help.

106
00:05:10,751 --> 00:05:14,770
Services and the self help services are
very easy to follow.

107
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:18,360
In the past 12 years,
over 2 million americans have used legal

108
00:05:18,361 --> 00:05:21,670
zoom and they've saved a ton of money.
Things like start your own business,

109
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:25,270
incorporate form an llc for starting at
99 bucks.

110
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:29,950
You can protect your family with a last
will for just $69 bucks or get a living

111
00:05:29,951 --> 00:05:33,940
trust.
Power of attorney and legal zoom is

112
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:37,060
recommended by nine out of 10 customers
that have used it,

113
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:40,350
which is an incredible number.
When you think about how many douche

114
00:05:40,351 --> 00:05:44,140
bags there are there in the world.
One out of 10 for sure,

115
00:05:44,141 --> 00:05:48,640
when I attend people's a fucking idiot.
so if nine out of 10 say legal zoom is

116
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,750
worth doing,
again,

117
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:53,980
I would say it's a very good company.
They Also have an a plus from the better

118
00:05:53,981 --> 00:05:56,080
business bureau and that's very
important.

119
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:01,200

127
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:21,670
You can play the music,
the job

128
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:26,760
login experience,
joe rogan podcast by night all day.

129
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,010
I love when people are really,

130
00:06:33,011 --> 00:06:36,340
really into shit and user are really,
really,

131
00:06:36,341 --> 00:06:37,660
really into coffee.
That's true.

132
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,100
And what's important about people like
you is that people like me who really do

133
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:45,220
love coffee,
but I know nothing about it and I'm not

134
00:06:45,221 --> 00:06:47,440
going to do all that research.
It's just not going to happen,

135
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:48,990
man.
It's just too,

136
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:51,760
too much work.
I need someone like you out there that's

137
00:06:51,761 --> 00:06:55,240
obsessed with coffee that can bring me
some coffee that smells like lemons.

138
00:06:55,241 --> 00:06:58,090
I'm here for you.
What is this stuff that you brought?

139
00:06:58,091 --> 00:07:01,540
You brought this ethiopian blend that
was warm when we got it.

140
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,830
Yeah.
Okay.

141
00:07:02,831 --> 00:07:03,664
So,
um,

142
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,480
I brought you ethiopian coffee because
okay.

143
00:07:07,481 --> 00:07:09,070
At some point.
So I'm a coffee guy,

144
00:07:09,071 --> 00:07:11,110
right?
I've been working in coffee for years,

145
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,260
25 years or more.
And when you're a coffee guy,

146
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,120
everybody asks you their coffee
questions.

147
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:19,360
And the number one question that people
start asking you is,

148
00:07:19,361 --> 00:07:20,740
what's your favorite coffee?
You know,

149
00:07:20,741 --> 00:07:24,670
everybody wants to know that.
So now most coffee people,

150
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:26,980
when they're asked that question a
little bit,

151
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:31,900
the way I lied was I would say a that's
like asking a parent who their favorite

152
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,010
child is.
You know what I mean?

153
00:07:33,011 --> 00:07:34,030
You can't,
you're not allowed

154
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,290
to.
You got a coffee problem.

155
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,100
Right?
Right.

156
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,400
Yeah.
I got allowed to do that.

157
00:07:39,401 --> 00:07:40,540
Right.
You're not allowed to do that.

158
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:42,220
You're not allowed to play favorites,
et cetera.

159
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,640
But,
uh,

160
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,290
putting that lie aside,
most coffee people are affectionate

161
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:51,130
about coffee from Ethiopia because
that's where coffees from originates.

162
00:07:51,131 --> 00:07:51,880
It originates.

163
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,650
Of course.
I'm going to be beautiful shit out.

164
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,360
It smells so good.
By the way,

165
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,670
what is the name of this particular
blend that you made?

166
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,100
It's

167
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:02,300
called yirgacheffe.
And you're a chef is the name of a town

168
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:07,360
in southern Ethiopia and it is in coffee
to coffee people.

169
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:11,030
You're a chef.
Is like a mecca.

170
00:08:11,031 --> 00:08:11,960
Yeah,
that's the spot.

171
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,700
This smells unbelievable.
That's what.

172
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:15,890
And that's why it it.
It's uh,

173
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:21,280
it's so famous.
The coffee smells like flowers and um,

174
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,600
and then like lemons,
like lemon oil or something.

175
00:08:23,601 --> 00:08:26,600
And that's really unique if you,
if you taste coffee that tastes,

176
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:31,160
smells and case like this,
it's almost certain that it comes from

177
00:08:31,161 --> 00:08:35,750
Ethiopia because because of the variety
they grow there because the way that

178
00:08:35,751 --> 00:08:38,150
they process it,
etc. It makes it really special.

179
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:39,730
So,
um,

180
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:43,210
this was roasted by,
by company in san francisco called

181
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:48,230
wrecking ball coffee and the coffee is
called Ethiopia classic yirgacheffe

182
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:53,240
classic meaning shove again.
Why I g m,

183
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:55,250
why I g

184
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:58,840
r wait,
sorry.

185
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,580
Y I r g a,
c h e f,

186
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:06,030
f e isn't a weird thing where you have
to write it down to look at it to make

187
00:09:06,031 --> 00:09:07,040
sure it's right.
Well,

188
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:09,840
the other weird thing too is that that's
one way to spell it.

189
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:13,740
There's like if you're in yoga chef and
you look at signs,

190
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:16,280
they're all spelled a different way
because it's actually an mri tech.

191
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:20,130
It's a different language and they just
translate it to english and various

192
00:09:20,131 --> 00:09:21,240
ways.
So you can spell it.

193
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:23,490
There's,
I've been in involved in internet.

194
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,440
Okay.
Here's another coffee geek admission.

195
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:28,890
I've been involved in these internet
conversations about how you should spell

196
00:09:28,891 --> 00:09:31,470
yoga show also how you should pronounce
it,

197
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:35,130
but in in ethiopian they pronounce it
differently in a way that I can't

198
00:09:35,131 --> 00:09:37,980
actually pronounce it.
How do they say give it a shot or a gut

199
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,750
check or good chef.

200
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:40,801
Yeah,
exactly.

201
00:09:40,801 --> 00:09:43,020
The last thing is like,
it's like a breathing,

202
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:45,110
but you just did it when,
how we get to do it.

203
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,100
There was an ethiopian guy next to me.
Yeah,

204
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:49,150
exactly.
I feel like,

205
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,450
you know,
like saying I've just been to roma or

206
00:09:51,451 --> 00:09:54,570
something like that is a weird thing.
Have my friend amber lyon who's coming

207
00:09:54,571 --> 00:09:57,460
on the podcast soon.
She was talking about boxing.

208
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:58,310
Yeah,
exactly.

209
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:59,760
Instead of Bahrain,
which is almost,

210
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:02,100
she was saying,
but then she,

211
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:03,590
she let it go and she said,
by rain,

212
00:10:03,591 --> 00:10:04,330
I'm like,
wait a minute.

213
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:07,910
I got to be one or the other here in
southern California in the newscasters

214
00:10:07,911 --> 00:10:10,860
suddenly just goes into the perfect
spanish pronunciation.

215
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,073
Yes,
yes.

216
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,530
Burrito.
Yeah,

217
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,180
exactly.
That's very important.

218
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:16,770
If you want to maintain the latin
audience,

219
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,450
you gotta roll your r's.
But anyway,

220
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,030
I don't try for that with coffee names
because it's a little too low.

221
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,460
Well,
you're taking a chance on being like

222
00:10:23,461 --> 00:10:27,000
already like kind of labeled as a crazy
coffee person.

223
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:30,270
But if you could pronounce all the words
then the pretentiousness level.

224
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,680
It gets very risky.
Well,

225
00:10:31,681 --> 00:10:32,281
it's,
you know,

226
00:10:32,281 --> 00:10:34,140
that's the thing with being a coffee
person,

227
00:10:34,141 --> 00:10:36,000
you know,
because people are afraid that you're

228
00:10:36,001 --> 00:10:38,280
going to be like a kind of a douchebag
about,

229
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,560
about,
about your coffee,

230
00:10:40,561 --> 00:10:41,394
you know,
because.

231
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:46,500
Because it's a weird conundrum because
on the one hand people like that you

232
00:10:46,501 --> 00:10:48,930
take it seriously and,
and because you're trying to,

233
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,850
you're trying to make,
you know,

234
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:56,180
embrace something that's super delicious
and you want it to be more delicious and

235
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:00,960
better tasting and stuff like that.
And so that causes you to learn stuff

236
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:04,800
about the geography of where coffee
comes from and all this weird trivia,

237
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:06,323
you know,
and,

238
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,223
and,
uh,

239
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,390
you start to learn about that stuff and
it's good.

240
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,270
But at the Same time,
it's very easy when you get really into

241
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:14,580
something to start to alienate people,
you know,

242
00:11:14,581 --> 00:11:18,750
and that goes for anything that goes for
wine or food or you know,

243
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:21,330
any sort of hobby,
you know,

244
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:26,760
when people can't talk about anything
else and then they start to get kind of

245
00:11:26,761 --> 00:11:28,970
snobby about stuff.
But.

246
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:31,620
And so it's a struggle for coffee people
all the time,

247
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:35,610
you know,
because what I know and I've learned in

248
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,740
my many years of doing this thing is
that,

249
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,720
especially in the morning,
you know,

250
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:42,900
people just want their coffee,
they don't want to fuck around with,

251
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:44,850
with,
you know all this,

252
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,730
stuff like that.
And we learned that in,

253
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:47,610
in,
you know.

254
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:50,580
So I started as a barista.
I worked for many,

255
00:11:50,581 --> 00:11:53,470
many years as a barista behind the car,
behind the bar,

256
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:55,060
making people their coffee in the
morning.

257
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:57,720
so do you really appreciate like when
someone's a connoisseur,

258
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:00,790
like the difference between the guys,
like I just want a cup of coffee and a

259
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,580
guy's like,
what's your blends today?

260
00:12:02,581 --> 00:12:05,410
A guy like who's really into it?
Lots of times it's the same person,

261
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:10,590
like a person that later in the day will
be like all into what kind of coffee it

262
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:15,010
is and really particular everybody just
their first cup of coffee,

263
00:12:15,011 --> 00:12:19,000
they just want a freaking cup of coffee.
Even even coffee pros like me,

264
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,280
you know,
we dispense with all that stuff that,

265
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,220
that time when you know you've been
there,

266
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,730
you wake up in the morning,
you don't know what's going on.

267
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,970
All you want is a cup of coffee and
people to be nice to you for the first

268
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,910
couple of hours of your day.
Usually most of the time when I don't

269
00:12:33,911 --> 00:12:37,120
have any time and I just want some sort
of caffeine,

270
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:39,060
I,
I have one of those little suppress

271
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:39,993
things.

272
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,850
Will you put those little capsules in
there and you catch it down,

273
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:45,910
you press the button and a shot of
espresso comes out.

274
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,890
Um,
are those bad?

275
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,480
Well,
it doesn't taste as good as the real.

276
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,450
That's the thing.
They're convenient,

277
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:53,620
you know,
and,

278
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:58,650
and whether they're there,
there's a lot of disadvantages to a,

279
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,900
to a thing like that.
On the other hand,

280
00:13:01,901 --> 00:13:04,870
I've tasted delicious coffee out of,
out of those real.

281
00:13:04,871 --> 00:13:08,950
If the coffee going in is,
is good if the machine is working right?

282
00:13:08,951 --> 00:13:11,230
I mean there's all sorts of different
kinds of machines.

283
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:15,220
WhaT is the expect you to know this
because you don't manufacture these

284
00:13:15,221 --> 00:13:16,180
things,
but what is the.

285
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:18,100
Is there plastic right?
Is that what it is?

286
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,280
Like a,
some out of aluminum.

287
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,840
Others that are made out of plastic?
Yeah.

288
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:24,670
Yeah.
I think the ones I have are aluminum.

289
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:28,060
So is that stuff okay for the flavor
when you're heating that up,

290
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,070
eating up the illumina.

291
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:29,980
It doesn't mess it up.
Yeah.

292
00:13:29,981 --> 00:13:34,330
That's not the problem.
The problem that's aluminum is pretty

293
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:38,020
resistant to stuff like that.
And they make that metal work,

294
00:13:38,021 --> 00:13:39,620
you know,
it's like a soda pop cans so they have

295
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,910
an engineered it to work well.
So it's not an issue with flavor,

296
00:13:42,911 --> 00:13:46,030
it's just an issue of what's in it will
rise and also how the,

297
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:49,930
how the machine works.
So if like you guys made coffee here

298
00:13:49,931 --> 00:13:54,931
today and you did it in a great way by
boiling the water in a kettle and then

299
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:56,770
you have a french press and use it.
now,

300
00:13:56,771 --> 00:14:00,220
the great thing about that is that
you're boiling the water.

301
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,310
The water is getting to 212.
That's where it boils.

302
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,680
And then by the time you pour it in the
french press,

303
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:07,810
it's cooled off.
Maybe it's 200,

304
00:14:07,811 --> 00:14:08,980
seven,
205.

305
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:13,600
Is that where you should have it at 195
to 205 degrees is where you should be.

306
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,490
Oh my gosh.
It's crazy.

307
00:14:15,491 --> 00:14:17,310
I know he,
he got so intense,

308
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:20,950
195 to 200,
five degrees and sunny spot.

309
00:14:20,951 --> 00:14:22,120
It is,
it's the honey spot.

310
00:14:22,121 --> 00:14:25,000
That's what,
that's where we get guys like me get

311
00:14:25,001 --> 00:14:27,580
fired up over stuff like,
well we bought today's the first day of

312
00:14:27,581 --> 00:14:29,560
using it here.
What I have at home,

313
00:14:29,561 --> 00:14:33,390
which is I think it's called breville b
r e v I l l e and it's uh,

314
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:36,460
it'll show you like you could have one
button for oolong tea.

315
00:14:36,461 --> 00:14:39,830
the other button for french press and so
this was the french press button.

316
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:43,480
So I assume they get it right then.
That's even better than what it did.

317
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:45,880
And this is breville.
They make some wonderful,

318
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,310
incredible coffee equipment.
Yeah,

319
00:14:48,311 --> 00:14:49,840
they do.
And uh,

320
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:55,200
and so the french press button will,
I'm sure get it to 205 degrees.

321
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,520
We should put a thermometer in that
bitch.

322
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:01,730
Find out whether or not I bet.
Find out we need a thermometer.

323
00:15:01,731 --> 00:15:03,320
Just me.
And it's very important.

324
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,170
Um,
well that's the thing guys like me,

325
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:08,540
we have thermometers at home because we,
it makes a difference.

326
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,470
So.
No,

327
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,740
but check this out.
So I believe what I was going to say is

328
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,920
the machines,
whether it's a pod machine or a capsule

329
00:15:15,921 --> 00:15:19,640
machine like you're talking about or a
mr coffee type machine,

330
00:15:19,641 --> 00:15:20,451
black and decker,
whatever,

331
00:15:20,451 --> 00:15:24,110
all those kinds of coffee machines.
One of the big challenges with those

332
00:15:24,111 --> 00:15:27,380
things as if they don't get hot enough.
If they're brewing coffee at 180

333
00:15:27,381 --> 00:15:29,090
degrees,
it's going to taste like crap.

334
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:32,570
And so you're cooking it while you're
brewing it.

335
00:15:32,571 --> 00:15:33,231
Yeah,
exactly.

336
00:15:33,231 --> 00:15:34,910
So the water is hot,

337
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,740
you know,
some amount of hot and if it's,

338
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:42,090
and if it's the right amount of hot in
between one and 95 and 205,

339
00:15:42,091 --> 00:15:45,630
right about 200 degrees,
then it makes the coffee taste.

340
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,030
So it actually literally changes the
flavor that's coming out of the beans

341
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:51,310
when it's hot enough to activate it,
right?

342
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,530
So,
and too hot is bad,

343
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,090
too hot is bad.
And so here's,

344
00:15:55,091 --> 00:15:57,370
here's the deal with coffee.
It's like if you looked at it under a

345
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:58,503
microscope,

346
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:01,670
took a slice of it and then looked at
that under a microscope,

347
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,510
you'd see all the cellular structure of
the coffee and it's like a sponge.

348
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:11,510
And inside the sponge is all the oils
and sugars and fats and stuff that may

349
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:18,920
really complicated.
It's thousands of little different

350
00:16:18,921 --> 00:16:21,560
chemicals in there that,
um,

351
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,400
that you need to get out of the sponge.
You need to essentially rinse it out of

352
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:28,610
the coffee to get it into your cup.
And that's what brewing is all about.

353
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,330
Now,
um,

354
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:35,210
if you don't do that well enough,
you leave all the good tasting stuff in

355
00:16:35,211 --> 00:16:39,500
the coffee that sponge,
the coffee cell walls,

356
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:41,720
you know,
and it doesn't get into your cup and

357
00:16:41,721 --> 00:16:43,880
your,
and your coffee doesn't taste very good

358
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:46,670
and plus you've wasted all the good
stuff.

359
00:16:46,671 --> 00:16:49,910
You wind up throwing it in the trash.
If the opposite thing happens,

360
00:16:49,911 --> 00:16:52,580
if you extract too much out of the
coffee,

361
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:55,640
if you squeeze that sponge till it's
perfectly dry,

362
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,720
then the last stuff to get extracted
tastes kind of bitter.

363
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:04,130
And uh,
like tannic,

364
00:17:04,131 --> 00:17:04,964
it,
it doesn't,

365
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:08,750
it doesn't taste good.
It has a characteristic that we call

366
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:09,650
over extracted.

367
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:14,080
And so that bitter tannin comes from a
prolonged exposure to hot water.

368
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:16,030
Either the water being too hot

369
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:21,360
or you bring it for too long or a.
Or like for example,

370
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,360
if you boiled coffee like they used to
do in the cowboy days,

371
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:28,710
he used to like boil coffee over the
campfire that will make the coffee taste

372
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:31,860
bitter and accurate and offline because
it's over extracted.

373
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,920
And that over extraction is what creates
tannins.

374
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,000
A,
right?

375
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,410
Well,
not tan and specifically,

376
00:17:37,411 --> 00:17:39,390
but those,
that tannic sort of flavor,

377
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:41,510
it's makes us stringency,
flavor,

378
00:17:41,511 --> 00:17:44,280
taste in your mouth,
and that bitterness is from the heat

379
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,040
itself.
Well,

380
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:48,870
it's extracting,
extracting bad tasting stuff out of the.

381
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,430
So it extracts

382
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:52,590
all the good tasting stuff.
But then there's an additional

383
00:17:52,591 --> 00:17:54,690
extraction,
a bad tasting stuff too.

384
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:55,883
Fascinating.
yeah.

385
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:57,870
So you want to get the stuff that's like
loose.

386
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:00,120
there's like a ripe fruit,
right?

387
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,530
it's like right in the middle.
It's this sweet spot.

388
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:06,250
And so this organization that I worked
for called the specialty coffee

389
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,440
association,
we in the 19 fifties,

390
00:18:08,441 --> 00:18:12,760
they started to do some science about
this and how to brew coffee properly and

391
00:18:12,761 --> 00:18:17,410
get the coffee to our tasted best to the
most people and they had thousands of

392
00:18:17,411 --> 00:18:20,250
people tasting different coffees,
you know,

393
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:25,320
and they determined what the perfect
extraction of a cup of coffee was to

394
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,240
most people in the,
in the world.

395
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:32,200
And um,
and then we,

396
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:35,500
then they designed a amount of
extraction.

397
00:18:35,501 --> 00:18:37,420
So I'm going to get technical on you.
Okay.

398
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,360
So 100 night I already told you 195 to
200.

399
00:18:40,361 --> 00:18:44,500
Five is the right temperature,
the extraction that you want to get is

400
00:18:44,501 --> 00:18:49,501
between 18 and 22 percent extraction.
Now this is coffee geek stuff that

401
00:18:50,081 --> 00:18:52,450
nobody wants to hear,
but this is the kind of stuff that we

402
00:18:52,451 --> 00:18:53,320
talk to each other about.

403
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,910
Wow.
And,

404
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,250
and so,
uh,

405
00:18:56,530 --> 00:19:00,010
and so like good.
If you have a favorite coffee place

406
00:19:00,011 --> 00:19:02,260
where the baristas are like really good
and they make the coffee taste really

407
00:19:02,261 --> 00:19:04,270
good,
chances are they know about that

408
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:09,990
extraction window and they're trying to
get the coffee within that extraction

409
00:19:10,151 --> 00:19:13,090
window.
So it tastes great if you exceed 22

410
00:19:13,091 --> 00:19:14,560
percent,
um,

411
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:18,430
and something closer to 30 percent of
the coffee is actually extractable,

412
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:22,030
you could get 30 percent of the material
out of the coffee if you want it,

413
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:27,510
if you totally squeezed the sponge dry,
but 18 to 22 percent is where it tastes

414
00:19:27,521 --> 00:19:28,354
good.

415
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,780
WOw,
that's crazy.

416
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,230
It is.
Now you jumped at the chance to pour

417
00:19:33,231 --> 00:19:36,050
this coffee and to brew this coffee or
something.

418
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,770
you didn't want us fucking it up?
Well,

419
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:38,480
yes.
Well,

420
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,630
it's true with good reason.
Neither jamie nor I know what the fuck

421
00:19:41,631 --> 00:19:42,030
we're doing.
Was like,

422
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,160
he knows what he's talking about,
the dive,

423
00:19:43,161 --> 00:19:43,941
I doubt it,
trust me,

424
00:19:43,941 --> 00:19:47,690
he learned everything from me.
We know a little bit,

425
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,600
you know.
Um,

426
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:53,680
but when it comes to these sort of
things like times of extraction and

427
00:19:54,711 --> 00:19:57,530
temperature,
does it vary depending on what kind of

428
00:19:57,531 --> 00:19:58,320
coffee you have?
like,

429
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,730
so this is the ethiopian coffee,
would you have a different if it was a

430
00:20:01,731 --> 00:20:02,564
jamaican?
Yep.

431
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:03,760
IT absolutely does.
And,

432
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:06,370
and so when,
um,

433
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:10,990
when coffee pros sort of start to work
with a coffee,

434
00:20:10,991 --> 00:20:14,230
we'll experiment with different
temperatures,

435
00:20:14,231 --> 00:20:18,260
different kinds of extraction,
different coarseness of grind to try to,

436
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:20,860
to try to get it right,
find the sweet spot.

437
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:22,000
Yeah.
We call it dialing it in.

438
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,570
So if we're like,
if,

439
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,580
if a,
if a,

440
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,890
if you're with a group of coffee people
and there's a new coffee,

441
00:20:29,891 --> 00:20:31,540
you'll ask somebody,
did you dial it in?

442
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:35,350
And that means that means did you get it
tasting the way it should be tasting?

443
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:36,060
Wow.

444
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:38,010
So what are the variables?
Like what?

445
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,620
Like,
how much is the spectrum of variance

446
00:20:40,621 --> 00:20:43,970
between say what's like an extreme given
extreme on each end of,

447
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:46,920
of what?
Of like brew times temperatures,

448
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,070
what's the difference?

449
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:51,160
Okay.
So every.

450
00:20:51,161 --> 00:20:52,330
There's a.
FIrst of all,

451
00:20:52,331 --> 00:20:54,400
there's a lot of different types.
Marley's yeah.

452
00:20:54,401 --> 00:20:55,570
Yeah.
Stuff's delicious.

453
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:56,930
Thank you.
Um,

454
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,320
there's a lot of different.
Uh,

455
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:02,770
I'm gonna have a little more to smell.
Really unique.

456
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:04,360
Yeah.
It's really beautiful.

457
00:21:04,361 --> 00:21:05,320
Clean,
clean,

458
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:06,670
floral coffee.
Yeah.

459
00:21:06,671 --> 00:21:09,130
It's so different.
We usually have this a hawaiian stuff

460
00:21:09,131 --> 00:21:09,920
lately.
Yeah.

461
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,400
A Hawaii roasters drinking.
That's really delicious.

462
00:21:12,401 --> 00:21:13,450
Cool.
Yeah,

463
00:21:13,451 --> 00:21:15,460
this is,
this is probably like the polar opposite

464
00:21:15,461 --> 00:21:16,750
of that actually.
It's very different.

465
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:18,940
Smells amazing.
Yeah.

466
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:22,600
That's the thing about this coffee is
it's super fragrant.

467
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,490
Yeah.
In a very unusual way.

468
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:27,220
Like it doesn't smell like coffee.
It's almost like it's almost like tea.

469
00:21:27,221 --> 00:21:28,054
Exactly.
right.

470
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,210
And that's,
I would describe this coffee is being t

471
00:21:31,211 --> 00:21:31,841
like.
Yeah,

472
00:21:31,841 --> 00:21:33,380
it's really beautiful.
And uh,

473
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:36,010
so anyway,
so there's all these different ways to

474
00:21:36,011 --> 00:21:38,800
brew coffee.
So you've got a french press here,

475
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:42,600
there's a pour over coffee drip coffee
that you,

476
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,160
certain things,
but it was a little vacuum thing.

477
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,950
Uh,
you might be talking about an era.

478
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:48,890
Are those good?
Yeah.

479
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:53,710
Coffee people love them
and each one of those has a different

480
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,870
deal.
So like in this french press,

481
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:59,860
coffee will steep for awhile,
sort of like tea and then you press it

482
00:21:59,861 --> 00:22:02,440
down and whatever.
And how long do you usually steep it?

483
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:05,140
four to six minutes is kind of a window.
Really?

484
00:22:05,141 --> 00:22:06,700
Yeah.
Know how does something like a clover

485
00:22:06,701 --> 00:22:07,930
work then?
Because the clover,

486
00:22:07,931 --> 00:22:11,620
that crazy computerized coffee machine
that cooked at very quickly,

487
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:12,401
very quickly.
Right?

488
00:22:12,401 --> 00:22:16,870
So the way that that works is it's
designed to be able to have fine,

489
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:18,470
finer coffee,
you know,

490
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,080
so um,
uh,

491
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:25,180
which changes the changes,
the extraction surface area,

492
00:22:25,181 --> 00:22:25,601
right?
If you,

493
00:22:25,601 --> 00:22:28,900
if you grind it really fine,
then it can,

494
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,090
it can brew,
it can extract really quickly.

495
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:34,270
so that's why like in an espresso
machine,

496
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,680
it's ground like to a powder.

497
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,600
Pull thAt video up of the clover
machine,

498
00:22:37,601 --> 00:22:38,890
just so you can see what we're talking
about.

499
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:42,850
For folks who don't know,
some genius guys who were coffee nerds.

500
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,600
Sorry.
Yeah,

501
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,740
no vander nosler.
He's like,

502
00:22:44,741 --> 00:22:45,574
yes,
I'm a coffee nerd.

503
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,030
I'm just under fdr,
but from stanford university,

504
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:55,380
and they figured out this machine which
costs some upwards of $10,000 dollars.

505
00:22:55,691 --> 00:22:59,290
Yeah,
like 11,000 bucks and I've never thought

506
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:03,190
about buying one until I watched someone
do it and use it,

507
00:23:03,191 --> 00:23:04,150
and I was like,
oh,

508
00:23:04,151 --> 00:23:05,710
this might be the fucking coolest thing
ever.

509
00:23:05,711 --> 00:23:08,860
Looked for a real coffee dork.
And then I found out that starbucks

510
00:23:08,861 --> 00:23:12,670
bought them all those sons of bitches
and I don't even see them.

511
00:23:12,671 --> 00:23:14,050
I never see them in a starbucks.
Oh yeah,

512
00:23:14,051 --> 00:23:15,180
they have them,
but they're not that.

513
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:17,860
Well,
starbucks should fucking sell them.

514
00:23:17,861 --> 00:23:19,570
I one of these for the office.
Tell it to you.

515
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:22,180
If they would,
I would be totally willing to buy one of

516
00:23:22,181 --> 00:23:23,670
thoSe and just put it in this office.

517
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,400
I'll see if I can make that happen.
Then it happened.

518
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,140
The.
Yeah,

519
00:23:28,141 --> 00:23:30,090
but I mean I used to have one in my
office,

520
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:33,360
so this is incredibly variable.
This thing,

521
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:37,020
if you've never seen it,
is this really beautifully constructed,

522
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:41,910
it looks like a giant Piston,
like a car engine piston and you pour

523
00:23:41,911 --> 00:23:44,850
coffee in it and the water in it and
then you stir it with like a little

524
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:45,703
whisk

525
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:51,010
and then dial in the coffee based on the
known recipes for that

526
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:52,103
coffee.
Right,

527
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,040
exactly.
and so.

528
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:56,190
And it was made really fancy.
You hear it?

529
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,780
Yeah.
It could communicate with other machines

530
00:23:58,781 --> 00:24:00,610
and you could send the recipe from one
machine to another.

531
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:02,270
Oh,
that's creepy.

532
00:24:02,271 --> 00:24:03,460
They're going to take over.
Yeah.

533
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:06,290
Coffee machine is going to take over and
at the end it's really unusual.

534
00:24:06,291 --> 00:24:11,291
It leaves this hockey hockey puck of
griNds at the top of the machine and

535
00:24:11,511 --> 00:24:15,410
then you have this squeegee which is
kind of an elegant way to deal with that

536
00:24:15,411 --> 00:24:18,380
little problem of what do you do with
the coffee grinds and they come off that

537
00:24:18,381 --> 00:24:20,810
piston yet,
but it comes up like a cheeseburger.

538
00:24:20,811 --> 00:24:23,200
It's so weird looking burger,
coffee,

539
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:23,781
break,
coffee,

540
00:24:23,781 --> 00:24:25,460
break out.
We call it and then you slide it in with

541
00:24:25,461 --> 00:24:28,560
this little like gas station,
windshield washer,

542
00:24:28,561 --> 00:24:29,660
squeegee thing.
Yep.

543
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:31,130
It's fucking bad ass.

544
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:34,410
Yeah.
And so on the.

545
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:40,030
So the reason that that can happen so
quickly is because you can use fine

546
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:44,930
coffee because it's got that hydraulic
piston that sort of pushes it up that's

547
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,220
incredibly strong.
It's got these,

548
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:49,920
these,
this metal filter that the coffee

549
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:54,921
grounds kind of sit on top of.
And so it's a pressurized situation

550
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:58,930
somewhere in the same realm as,
as uh,

551
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:02,070
the aircraft we were talking about
something similar.

552
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:05,490
And by the way,
the aero press is essentially a home,

553
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:09,210
you know,
$50 version of that

554
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:11,210
and it's just as good and.
Yeah.

555
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:13,520
Alright,
fuck the clover then jesus christ,

556
00:25:13,521 --> 00:25:15,740
we almost,
we just saved ourselves 11 grand or

557
00:25:15,741 --> 00:25:16,574
whatever it is.
Yeah.

558
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,330
That was really designed for like a
coffee service and bad ass though,

559
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:23,330
man,
of that kind of technology.

560
00:25:23,331 --> 00:25:26,990
The fact that they want to support them,
they were willing to go out and invest

561
00:25:26,991 --> 00:25:28,880
the money to make something like that
and design it.

562
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:30,980
Have you seen that?
The steam punk,

563
00:25:30,981 --> 00:25:32,730
yet there's,
okay,

564
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:35,860
there's all these great coffee machines
out there that pulled out of steam,

565
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:37,550
pull it up.
And,

566
00:25:37,551 --> 00:25:38,990
uh,
and this is,

567
00:25:38,991 --> 00:25:40,250
uh,
recently,

568
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:42,040
uh,
uh,

569
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:47,650
designed machine and it's got,
it's got these glass tubes and bubbles

570
00:25:48,471 --> 00:25:50,330
and you know,
all this crazy shit.

571
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:50,921
You're,
you're,

572
00:25:50,921 --> 00:25:51,630
you're gonna love it.
When,

573
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:53,330
what is,
what is the benefit of that machine?

574
00:25:53,331 --> 00:25:55,320
It's just another,
um,

575
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:57,290
it,
it actually works on a very similar

576
00:25:57,291 --> 00:25:59,690
principle to all these things.
Um,

577
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:05,500
but they're,
all coffee machines are designed to make

578
00:26:05,601 --> 00:26:09,110
it easier to do what I said before,
the,

579
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:09,980
the,
uh,

580
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:10,461
yeah,
that's,

581
00:26:10,461 --> 00:26:11,750
that's it.
That's the steam punk.

582
00:26:11,751 --> 00:26:14,390
So that's that.
All each of those looks like a pirate

583
00:26:14,391 --> 00:26:15,320
chambers.
Yeah.

584
00:26:15,321 --> 00:26:18,310
Each of those chambers brew coffee.
Whoa.

585
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:20,630
Um,
and uh,

586
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,020
now interestingly,
you might get a computer,

587
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,490
a computer screen.
Yeah.

588
00:26:24,491 --> 00:26:25,070
It's.
Yeah.

589
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:27,350
And that computer screen is to dial in
all these,

590
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,510
all these variables,
you know,

591
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:34,880
so recently out of the clover.
Too much pressure.

592
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,343
Yeah.

593
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,430
That's a question that's like asking me
what my favorite child is.

594
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,520
Sorry,
I probably can't play favorites.

595
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:43,500
No,
but it's right up there with clover.

596
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:44,160
Yeah,
absolutely.

597
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,500
How much has that been a thing?
That's a good question.

598
00:26:46,501 --> 00:26:49,650
I don't know the answer to that.
I would guess in the same sort of range,

599
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:52,020
but,
and all of these things.

600
00:26:52,021 --> 00:26:53,700
Now I'm going to tell you something
else,

601
00:26:53,701 --> 00:26:55,950
which is these,
these machines,

602
00:26:55,951 --> 00:27:00,951
all they do is make it easier to brew
coffee like this.

603
00:27:02,011 --> 00:27:04,140
So you've got,
you've got some pretty sophisticated

604
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,820
equipment in your kitchen and this is
all what he's doing right here.

605
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,150
This was the right stuff.
Wow.

606
00:27:09,151 --> 00:27:10,020
This is wild,
man.

607
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:11,490
This makes me feel like a scientist
though.

608
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,850
I'd like to have that.
It's kind of laboratories.

609
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,700
It was very mad scientists and so the
water's boiling and one of them and then

610
00:27:17,701 --> 00:27:19,440
the coffees and the other one.
Is that what's going on here?

611
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:22,140
Well,
the one in the middle is kind of getting

612
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:24,830
ready.
He's going to dump some coffee in there.

613
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:29,010
He's in the one on the right.
It's already extracting the coffee and

614
00:27:29,011 --> 00:27:31,920
these little,
those little up pistons are there to

615
00:27:31,921 --> 00:27:35,550
sort of be the filters of the coffee.
It's a complicated machine.

616
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,620
And I would say so a couple of weeks ago
heRe in los angeles,

617
00:27:40,621 --> 00:27:41,454
there was a,
uh,

618
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:44,690
there was a battle between,
um,

619
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:47,120
a guy called nick show.
Nick cho is the,

620
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:49,950
is the guy who,
he's one of the owners of this coffee

621
00:27:49,951 --> 00:27:51,690
company who arrested this coffee,
we're drinking,

622
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:55,030
and then the inventor of that machine,
the,

623
00:27:55,031 --> 00:27:57,870
uh,
the steam punk went head to head and had

624
00:27:57,871 --> 00:28:02,871
like a man versus machine kind of thing.
And nick was just using very simple

625
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,840
little brewer that he poured the water
on,

626
00:28:06,841 --> 00:28:10,080
just totally manual.
And then the other guy was,

627
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:10,973
was,
uh,

628
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:15,210
was use manning the steam punk and they
were like having this head to head where

629
00:28:15,211 --> 00:28:19,080
they each had to brew six different
coffees for these three judges and they

630
00:28:19,081 --> 00:28:20,690
couldn't see what they were drinking all
this stuff.

631
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:22,920
And uh,
now the,

632
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:25,890
the.
So the result was that the steam punk

633
00:28:25,891 --> 00:28:29,670
machine won by a hair.
It was essentially a tie that the,

634
00:28:29,671 --> 00:28:30,750
uh,
um,

635
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,890
uh,
and the point is that you can,

636
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:39,870
you can make coffee delicious by being
really good at mastering the variables,

637
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:43,620
knowing what your,
you're knowing what grind looks right,

638
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:45,690
knowing how hot the water is,
et cetera,

639
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:48,120
or you can interest that stuff to a
machine.

640
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:51,390
And that's what machInes do.
They just get the water right every time

641
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:53,730
they get the,
they get the,

642
00:28:53,731 --> 00:28:56,550
what we call the turbulence,
like how much it gets stirred right.

643
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:59,250
Every time.
And if you can replicate something very

644
00:28:59,251 --> 00:29:02,490
precisely again and again and again,
the coffee is going to be really good.

645
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:03,710
I get a sense

646
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:08,150
though that you're a purist and the you
prefer to use manual equipment.

647
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:11,450
Almost like if you drove a car,
you would want a manual gearbox.

648
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:12,543
Are you that guy?

649
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:15,570
I am that guy.
Well,

650
00:29:15,571 --> 00:29:16,770
I told,
I told somebody.

651
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:20,070
Somebody was interviewing me for
something a while ago and I told them I

652
00:29:20,071 --> 00:29:23,940
don't own a coffee machine in my house
and I don't that I have essentially the

653
00:29:23,941 --> 00:29:28,230
same setup that you have a water boiler
that boils the water for me.

654
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,030
A good grinder.
I notice you have a good grinder in

655
00:29:30,031 --> 00:29:31,440
there.
Um,

656
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:36,030
and uh,
some home style pouring,

657
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:39,480
you know,
I use a basically very cheap $30.

658
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,580
Do you have a friend that I have a
french press.

659
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:45,250
I usually use paper filter though,
just because I prefer the flavor.

660
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:46,070
Do you really?
Yeah.

661
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:47,630
Okay.
that's an interesting thing to bring up

662
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,060
because I'm.
One of The things that I like about a

663
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:54,540
french press is when you get that sort
of bubbly surface and then when you pour

664
00:29:54,541 --> 00:29:57,350
it into a mug,
you get kinda like a little phone like

665
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,190
that.
Do you still get that when you go

666
00:29:59,191 --> 00:30:00,210
through a paper filter?
No,

667
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:03,640
that's exactly what it takes out.
That seems like that's a good thing.

668
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:05,640
It's good thing to you and that's great.
so you know,

669
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:08,050
you don't like it flavor,
you know this.

670
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,400
Okay.
So we're tasting it now.

671
00:30:09,401 --> 00:30:12,070
can you taste in your mouth how you feel
like there is?

672
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:14,110
You can still taste the coffee a little
bit.

673
00:30:14,111 --> 00:30:15,430
Yeah.
And it'S coating your mouth,

674
00:30:15,431 --> 00:30:17,860
sort of like as if you just drank a
glass of milk or something.

675
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:21,730
Okay.
So that's called body or after taste and

676
00:30:21,731 --> 00:30:22,850
after taste.
Those,

677
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:25,420
those are technical coffee tasting
terms.

678
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,630
Um,
and so body is the feeling,

679
00:30:28,631 --> 00:30:32,410
the texture of the coffee in your mouth.
And aftertaste is the flavor of the

680
00:30:32,411 --> 00:30:34,510
coffee that remains in your mouth once
you're gone.

681
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:38,230
Once it's gone.
And aftertaste especially is really

682
00:30:38,231 --> 00:30:40,930
important because you drink coffee in
the morning and you're driving to work.

683
00:30:40,931 --> 00:30:43,390
You still have that flavor of coffee in
your mouth.

684
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:45,760
If that's good,
then that's great.

685
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:48,580
Then you get,
you get an extra 20 minutes out of your

686
00:30:48,581 --> 00:30:50,650
cup of coffee.
It's A bonus.

687
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:53,260
If it's bad,
if it's bad flavor and you feel like you

688
00:30:53,261 --> 00:30:56,800
need a mint,
then that's like a bad after taste.

689
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:59,800
And so you either.
You're used to drinking good coffee.

690
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:03,040
You like that feeling in your mouth.
Do you like that flavor in your mouth?

691
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,780
You like aftertaste.
That's good.

692
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:09,040
You're brewing coffee the right way.
For me,

693
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:11,740
I,
I just tend to want to move on to the

694
00:31:11,741 --> 00:31:13,360
next flavor,
whatever it is,

695
00:31:13,361 --> 00:31:13,700
whatever.
Yeah.

696
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,140
Oh,
you're such a coffee geek.

697
00:31:15,141 --> 00:31:18,320
You want to geek out with a bunch of
flavors in your mouth all day.

698
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,960
Wow.
You're taking it to a new level.

699
00:31:20,961 --> 00:31:24,320
You went with a paper filter just to
remove aftertaste so you can move onto

700
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:26,720
the next flavor.
Couldn't you rinse it out with some

701
00:31:26,721 --> 00:31:28,520
seltzer or something like that?
People do that.

702
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:30,410
Yeah.
Maybe some ginger like you do with

703
00:31:30,411 --> 00:31:31,160
sushi.
Yeah.

704
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,240
Would that work?
I get.

705
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:32,730
Yeah.
I am.

706
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:34,020
Blood palate cleanser.
What?

707
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:36,350
You could do power plans or do you have
to brush your tongue or anything like

708
00:31:36,351 --> 00:31:37,310
that in between?
People do.

709
00:31:37,311 --> 00:31:39,040
There are people that scrape the tongue.
Man.

710
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:43,530
I don't do any of that mess.
That's the dark end of the pool.

711
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,040
People Where you can't see the bottom.
Yeah.

712
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:48,980
Your coffee geeking out in the woods.
Hardcore.

713
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:49,823
Whatever.
Yeah.

714
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:52,740
So this is a very delicious coffee and
you.

715
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:54,500
One of the things that I noticed is that
you,

716
00:31:54,501 --> 00:31:57,320
um,
you serve it completely black.

717
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:00,920
You don't fuck around wIth coffee
filters or sugars,

718
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:05,450
but I mean genuinely coffee,
coffee people don't judge people that,

719
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:07,870
that do that.
Everybody [inaudible] to me.

720
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,150
I appreciate that.
That's really sweet.

721
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:10,740
Do you put stuff in your coffee?
Yeah,

722
00:32:10,741 --> 00:32:11,574
usually.
Yeah.

723
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:13,770
Usually we will.
This is what I wanted you to try this.

724
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:18,720
This is a coffee mixed with grass fed
butter and mct oil.

725
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:21,460
I found about this from getting
familiar.

726
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,393
Yeah.
Yeah.

727
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:24,710
This is Hawaii roasters,
right?

728
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:25,660
I'll just.
Hawaii roasters,

729
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,810
rusty,
rusty,

730
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:29,160
rusty.
Rusty's hawaiian.

731
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:30,450
And so,
um,

732
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,440
this,
uh,

733
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,300
I found out about this from this dude
dave asprey,

734
00:32:33,301 --> 00:32:37,320
he calls it bulletproof coffee and
apparently a guy named rob wolf,

735
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:39,490
he was the first guy to figure it out.
What it is,

736
00:32:39,491 --> 00:32:44,000
is coffee mixed with grass fed butter
and mct oil and then it's blended.

737
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:48,230
And the idea being that blending it all
up like that has you get all the healthy

738
00:32:48,231 --> 00:32:49,970
fats,
make steam with the caffeine is sort of

739
00:32:49,971 --> 00:32:50,630
a seat.
Well,

740
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:53,040
medium chain triglyceride oil,
it's like

741
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:59,360
palm oils and mostly coconut oils.
You take the spinning in a centrifuge

742
00:32:59,361 --> 00:33:01,430
and extracted,
I don't know the exact process,

743
00:33:01,431 --> 00:33:06,360
but it's essentially healthy fats and
then it's all mixed with this.

744
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:09,620
And the benefit of it is that because
it's all connected to the fats,

745
00:33:09,621 --> 00:33:11,960
you get sort of a slow burn,
a slow release.

746
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:16,370
I get the impression from you though,
that you fucking hopped up on coffee all

747
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:17,780
day and a bunch of different kinds.
You don't need no slow release.

748
00:33:17,781 --> 00:33:20,080
You just ride in that boat right into
the rocks.

749
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:23,720
It's interesting.
There was something you said earlier as

750
00:33:23,721 --> 00:33:25,340
we were getting started,
you were talking about,

751
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:27,950
oh,
you were talking about the bars at the

752
00:33:27,951 --> 00:33:31,040
top of the show,
you the meat bar or something like that?

753
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:31,761
Yeah,
yeah,

754
00:33:31,761 --> 00:33:32,640
the warrior bar,
right?

755
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:35,180
The buffalo and cranberry.

756
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:40,400
So there's a story in coffee and uh,
we don't know if it's it,

757
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:43,320
if it's true or not,
but this is the legend is that in

758
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:46,830
ancient Ethiopia,
the ethiopian warriors would take the

759
00:33:46,831 --> 00:33:49,770
fruits of the coffee.
So coffee grows like a fruit.

760
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,930
It's got,
you may have seen pictures.

761
00:33:51,931 --> 00:33:53,150
It looks like a cherry.
Yeah.

762
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,800
And the two beans or like flat up
against each other,

763
00:33:56,430 --> 00:34:01,020
like the pits of the cherry.
But around that is like a fruit layer,

764
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:03,690
like a sweet fruit layer.
The fruit tastes sort of like,

765
00:34:03,691 --> 00:34:07,100
it's kind of slimy,
but it tastes like a mix of a,

766
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:10,830
of watermelon and jasmine.
And then there's a kind of a tough

767
00:34:10,890 --> 00:34:15,890
leathery skin outside.
And the legend says that the ethiopians

768
00:34:15,901 --> 00:34:20,901
would take that fruit and make a ball
with a animal fat in some stories,

769
00:34:23,251 --> 00:34:25,850
say butter and other stories say like,
like,

770
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:27,130
uh,
um,

771
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,940
uh,
like cow fat,

772
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:34,050
and they would make balls out of them
and put them in there.

773
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:37,920
They're a packs.
And then just before a battle,

774
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:42,300
these warriors would eat this,
this like power bar thing,

775
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:45,390
and it was like fat from the,
from the,

776
00:34:45,391 --> 00:34:48,420
uh,
from the animal fat to give you energy

777
00:34:48,421 --> 00:34:49,410
and,
and kind of.

778
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:53,940
And then the sugar from the coffee fruit
to give that blast of energy.

779
00:34:53,941 --> 00:34:58,941
And then the caffeine together.
Now some people say that this is like an

780
00:34:59,101 --> 00:35:01,850
invented story.
Other people say that,

781
00:35:01,851 --> 00:35:04,230
that you had no,
this is what the ancient ethiopians

782
00:35:04,231 --> 00:35:06,720
actually did before,
before flight fighting a battle.

783
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:09,990
What is known is that the engine
ethiopians were known as,

784
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:11,980
especially intense warriors.

785
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:15,760
How come nobody has recreated this?
We need an on it coffee ball.

786
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:18,880
We need to make that right away.
That seems like something we need to.

787
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:21,310
But when he said,
when you said coffee and butter,

788
00:35:21,311 --> 00:35:22,640
that's what I thought of is,
is,

789
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:27,160
is that kind of thing,
these coffee balls with butter?

790
00:35:27,161 --> 00:35:29,060
Maybe.
Maybe that's what they're trying to kind

791
00:35:29,061 --> 00:35:29,920
of recreate here.
I don't know.

792
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:30,640
Well,
um,

793
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,490
this was,
uh,

794
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:34,150
apparently the original people have been
putting,

795
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:34,931
gee,
you know,

796
00:35:34,931 --> 00:35:36,910
it had been putting that in coffee for a
long.

797
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:43,090
But there was also like a yak t that uh,
the himalayans used to tibetans used

798
00:35:43,161 --> 00:35:48,161
that was mixed with this yak butter and
t to make this creamy sort of a

799
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,480
concoction.
I like what I like about the mixing it

800
00:35:51,481 --> 00:35:56,481
with the butter and mct oil is that it
gives you like a long lasting effect of

801
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,890
the caffeine.
Your body has to break down all those

802
00:35:58,891 --> 00:36:01,650
fats and sort of blended in,
connected with the caffeine.

803
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:04,770
You don't get it as a big burst.
Like I drank this stuff because I

804
00:36:04,771 --> 00:36:07,440
haven't drinking black coffee for a
while and with,

805
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,060
with nothing attached to it,
it's just like,

806
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:11,070
whew.
It just goes right into your system.

807
00:36:11,071 --> 00:36:13,620
And you could,
you could feel yourself like pepping up.

808
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:15,420
Um,
how do you avoid heart attacks?

809
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:16,840
It's interesting.
Uh,

810
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:18,890
I a,
I don't,

811
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,313
don't worry about it.
No,

812
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,580
I'm just kidding obviously,
but yeah,

813
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:25,640
but you do get a rush from this.
This is some strong caffeine coffee.

814
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:27,350
This is some strong stuff.
Yeah.

815
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:28,310
I mean,
I guess,

816
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:30,470
I guess I don't look good way.
I'm not criticizing.

817
00:36:30,471 --> 00:36:30,640
No,
no,

818
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,660
no.
I know and it's really uniquely

819
00:36:32,661 --> 00:36:33,494
delicious.
Yeah.

820
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,010
I'm,
I'm,

821
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:37,880
I'm kinda shocked.
My favorite coffee lately is this stuff

822
00:36:37,881 --> 00:36:39,870
called rusty's hawaiian.
I've been drinkinG this a lot lately.

823
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,620
Arrestees?
Yeah.

824
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:42,350
oh god.
It's so good.

825
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,101
Yeah.
God,

826
00:36:43,101 --> 00:36:44,470
that stuff is good.
I just,

827
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,750
something I really love about coffee
from the big island.

828
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:51,260
I don't know what it is,
but I had first tried hawaiian hawaiian

829
00:36:51,261 --> 00:36:55,040
roasters is the red bag that somebody
told me about it.

830
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:55,731
Like,
dude,

831
00:36:55,731 --> 00:36:58,400
you got to try a hawaiian coffee.
And so,

832
00:36:58,401 --> 00:37:00,810
uh,
I got a hold this stuff a while back and

833
00:37:00,811 --> 00:37:05,770
it's my all time favorite coffee just
has this like really sort of a um,

834
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:08,600
a,
a dark rich taste to it.

835
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,250
Very,
very different from this stuff.

836
00:37:10,251 --> 00:37:11,760
This ethiopian stuff.
Yeah.

837
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:14,780
So different deal.
If coffee started there,

838
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,910
it started in Ethiopia.
Is that now,

839
00:37:16,911 --> 00:37:20,300
did people take the plants and plant
them in other places?

840
00:37:20,301 --> 00:37:21,170
Is that what happened?
Yeah.

841
00:37:21,171 --> 00:37:23,810
So what happened was,
so the ethiopians were the first ones to

842
00:37:23,811 --> 00:37:26,360
sort of discover coffee.
This is what we have here,

843
00:37:26,361 --> 00:37:28,250
which we usually drink.
That's my favorite.

844
00:37:28,251 --> 00:37:30,980
The one in the red bag.
That's what is it called?

845
00:37:30,981 --> 00:37:33,170
It has a name though.
It's like it says here,

846
00:37:33,171 --> 00:37:35,260
it says mocha peaberry from maui.
Yeah.

847
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:40,270
That's like a 94 on the coffee's so good
man.

848
00:37:40,921 --> 00:37:41,470
Yeah.

849
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:43,210
But this is,
this is part of the story I can tell

850
00:37:43,211 --> 00:37:44,044
you.
I can.

851
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,720
You were asking about coffee coming from
Ethiopia,

852
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,640
etc. Okay.
So,

853
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:49,760
um,
uh,

854
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:51,580
yeah.
Okay.

855
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:53,260
This is cool.
They're really tiny,

856
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:55,240
really tiny.
And so,

857
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:59,350
um,
what happened was from the forests of

858
00:37:59,351 --> 00:38:01,300
Ethiopia,
um,

859
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:03,700
on the,
on either side of what's called the rift

860
00:38:03,701 --> 00:38:05,170
valley,
it's where it's,

861
00:38:05,171 --> 00:38:09,310
where the human species evolved.
It's where we evolved over there and

862
00:38:09,311 --> 00:38:11,740
coffee have all been in the same place.
So,

863
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:12,653
uh,
uh,

864
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:15,820
which is crazy to begin with.
And,

865
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:16,450
and,
uh,

866
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:20,890
the ethiopians consumed it somehow.
But then the,

867
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:25,000
uh,
somehow probably by the people on the

868
00:38:25,001 --> 00:38:27,730
other side of the red sea and what's now
Yemen,

869
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:32,410
which was then called arabia felix,
this is like in,

870
00:38:32,411 --> 00:38:33,380
uh,
about uh,

871
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:36,670
1100.
They said they said,

872
00:38:36,671 --> 00:38:38,560
wait a second,
we got some,

873
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:43,590
some of the ethiopian slaves brought
some coffee seeds over there and they

874
00:38:44,501 --> 00:38:47,050
started planting coffee in what's now
Yemen.

875
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:51,640
Um,
and they started growing it and it

876
00:38:51,641 --> 00:38:55,120
turned into a big deal and they were the
first ones that actually expoRted it out

877
00:38:55,121 --> 00:38:57,040
of the,
out of the area.

878
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:58,510
So,
um,

879
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,130
and the biggest,
the port,

880
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,620
the main port at that time in Yemen was
called mocha.

881
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:03,670
So

882
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:04,990
you've heard,
you know,

883
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:09,010
have a cafe mocha or coffee is called
mocha mocha,

884
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:10,810
mocha,
java,

885
00:39:10,811 --> 00:39:13,630
all That stuff.
That's all a reference to this one port

886
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:15,820
in Yemen.
It's still there.

887
00:39:15,821 --> 00:39:17,680
It's called alma alpaca.
And,

888
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:19,173
and,
um,

889
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:21,250
I thought mocha had something to do with
chocolate.

890
00:39:21,251 --> 00:39:21,920
Yeah,
we,

891
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,520
we in the now in the states.
Yeah,

892
00:39:24,521 --> 00:39:25,420
we kind of.
Well,

893
00:39:25,421 --> 00:39:29,020
it's that people started adding
chocolate to coffee that wasn't from

894
00:39:29,021 --> 00:39:31,350
there to try to make it taste like it
was from there.

895
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:35,050
So it had a natural chunk actually
chocolatey taste to it.

896
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:38,350
Can you still get coffee from you?
It's very hard because it's Yemen,

897
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:39,460
you know,
it's crazy.

898
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:42,400
And so yeah,
it's a difficult place to do business

899
00:39:42,401 --> 00:39:43,870
and need to make friends with prince
naseem.

900
00:39:43,871 --> 00:39:45,400
How mad do you remember that guy?
No,

901
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:48,880
he was a boxer from Yemen.
He did a lot of wild shit.

902
00:39:48,881 --> 00:39:50,740
came in on a magic carpet.
Oh,

903
00:39:50,741 --> 00:39:52,300
crazy.
He used to dance around the ring.

904
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:54,660
Yemen's an amazing place.
I mean I've,

905
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,890
I've never been there,
but I've seen lots of pictures.

906
00:39:56,900 --> 00:40:01,330
I've known lots of yemeni people,
but it's just politically politically

907
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:02,710
dangerous.
Volatile.

908
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:05,510
But that's unfoRtunate.
It sounds like it's something unique

909
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:06,810
coffee out of there.
But so,

910
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:09,400
so anyway,
so they brought,

911
00:40:09,401 --> 00:40:10,510
when they brought coffee for me,

912
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:14,910
Ethiopia tm and they brought only a few
plants and then they use those to be the

913
00:40:14,911 --> 00:40:17,250
parents of all the,
the,

914
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:20,070
uh,
the coffee in Yemen and that they were

915
00:40:20,071 --> 00:40:22,560
the ones that exported it anyway.
Then,

916
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:26,280
but then this is in history,
they were Growing coffee,

917
00:40:26,281 --> 00:40:28,200
they were exporting it.
Other people said,

918
00:40:28,201 --> 00:40:30,060
wait a second,
we want end on this coffee deal because

919
00:40:30,061 --> 00:40:32,790
you're making money selling coffee,
but they had a.

920
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:35,940
They had a penalty of death if you got
seeds,

921
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,790
if you took seeds out of Yemen at that
time,

922
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:43,230
you got caught exporting fertile coffee
seeds you can be put to death.

923
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:44,910
It was that valuable,
that valuable.

924
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:47,320
That's incredible.
And this is at a time where when like

925
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:52,110
the english and the dutch were fighting
over the dutch east indies as the spice

926
00:40:52,111 --> 00:40:53,040
islands,
you know,

927
00:40:53,041 --> 00:40:53,874
people,
all these,

928
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:58,260
everybody was trying to get some
colonies going to export these cash

929
00:40:58,261 --> 00:41:00,330
crops and they saw coffee as a potential
cash crop.

930
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:05,750
Some dutch spies successfully got some
coffee out of Yemen and they planted it

931
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:10,890
on and they had just won the war with
the english over the dutch east indies

932
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:16,220
and they planted the coffee that they
stole from Yemen in what's now Indonesia

933
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:17,670
on the island of java.

934
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,570
Wow.
And they turned that they did great.

935
00:41:21,571 --> 00:41:22,590
They.
They planned it.

936
00:41:22,591 --> 00:41:24,600
All these farms,
they were producing coffee and that's

937
00:41:24,601 --> 00:41:27,720
why we still call it coffee java.
Wow.

938
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:30,830
So in mocha java,
mocha java is in,

939
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:32,760
you know,
150 years ago.

940
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,130
those were the two places

941
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:35,600
that made most of the coffee in the
world.

942
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:40,930
The port of mocha in Yemen and the
island of java in the dutch east indies.

943
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:44,530
Wow.
And Ethiopia back then,

944
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:46,840
like if that's where it all started
from,

945
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:49,750
they weren't exporting anything then
they were just like letting it go.

946
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,600
It would juSt eat drinking it
themselves.

947
00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:52,590
Wow.
Yeah.

948
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:55,830
And they,
they didn't build an export market so.

949
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:59,970
So then it gets weirder.
You ready?

950
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:01,200
Yeah.
So,

951
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,540
uh,
the in the,

952
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:08,810
at one point the dutch and the french
signed a treaty and like,

953
00:42:09,391 --> 00:42:10,050
uh,
you know,

954
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:14,940
some sort of treaty and as a gift the
dutch gave one coffee tree to the

955
00:42:14,941 --> 00:42:19,460
french,
one coffee tree and the french in like,

956
00:42:19,461 --> 00:42:21,550
uh,
in France they built a,

957
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:26,400
a hot house like a greenhouse just to
hold this plant.

958
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:29,040
And it was the first,
it was the first greenhouse in europe.

959
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:32,780
The first greenhouse in europe was for a
coffee.

960
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:33,830
Right.
And,

961
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:37,170
and they planted other stuff there too,
but this coffee plant was like really

962
00:42:37,171 --> 00:42:40,770
special and,
and they used cuttings from that plant

963
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:44,730
to plant.
They wanted to plant some stuff in the

964
00:42:44,731 --> 00:42:46,170
west indies and the caribbean.

965
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:48,210
Um,
they wanted to plant some coffee,

966
00:42:48,211 --> 00:42:53,211
the french did to for their colonies.
And so this one guy named gabriela the

967
00:42:53,341 --> 00:42:58,341
clue he was responsible for bringing the
coffee from France to martinique,

968
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:03,780
but so he brought this one plant and he
had it in a glass box,

969
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:07,290
but they ran out of wind on the journey
and the.

970
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,600
So they were stuck in the middle of the
atlantic ocean.

971
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:12,330
Gabriela,
the clue was sharing his water ration

972
00:43:12,331 --> 00:43:14,690
with this plant to keep it alive.
Oh my god.

973
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:17,100
He managed to keep it alive,
planted it.

974
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:22,190
And that one plant was the parent of
most of the coffee in central America,

975
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:25,950
south ameRica,
etc. Holy shit.

976
00:43:25,951 --> 00:43:27,120
Yeah.
So,

977
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:32,180
so now there's a scientific impact to
this because all the genetic diversity

978
00:43:32,761 --> 00:43:35,100
that was in Ethiopia,
all the thousands of different coffee

979
00:43:35,101 --> 00:43:39,630
varieties that were in Ethiopia.
Imagine how that got narrowed down from

980
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:43,290
getting a brought from Ethiopia tm in
the first place.

981
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:48,590
Then whatever plants those dutch spies a
stole to put the coffee in java.

982
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:54,830
Then that one plant that went to a,
that went to the new world that went to

983
00:43:55,711 --> 00:43:58,800
France first and then to the new world
that's a,

984
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:03,600
they call it a genetic bottleneck,
so all the coffee outside of Ethiopia is

985
00:44:03,601 --> 00:44:08,250
kind of siblings to one another.
That's incredible and that.

986
00:44:08,251 --> 00:44:10,680
And that's a problem for us because if
there's a disease that,

987
00:44:10,681 --> 00:44:15,030
that one genetic variety of coffee is,
is susceptible to,

988
00:44:15,390 --> 00:44:17,430
it can wipe out the whole coffee deal.

989
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:22,860
it's so incredible that one particular
area of the world was the only place

990
00:44:22,861 --> 00:44:26,430
where this stuff was growing and now
it's considered to be a completely

991
00:44:26,431 --> 00:44:27,330
worldwide beverage.

992
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,390
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

993
00:44:28,391 --> 00:44:31,680
And the ethiopians are kind of,
they're kind of pissed off about that.

994
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:34,830
Seriously.
If you go and you talked to them and

995
00:44:34,831 --> 00:44:36,120
they're like [inaudible],
you know,

996
00:44:36,121 --> 00:44:41,121
everybody says they've identified coffee
with columbia right now while fucking

997
00:44:42,330 --> 00:44:43,800
one.
And they hate,

998
00:44:43,801 --> 00:44:47,160
they hate one valdez and epo.
They're like,

999
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,010
that's our thing.
That's our thing that the world is

1000
00:44:50,011 --> 00:44:50,850
getting richard.
So,

1001
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:52,400
um,
and,

1002
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:53,310
but that's right.
I mean,

1003
00:44:53,311 --> 00:44:55,020
that's true.
If you go to Ethiopia,

1004
00:44:55,070 --> 00:45:00,060
the different kinds of flavors that you
can get in coffee from Ethiopia is crazy

1005
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:04,020
compared to any anywhere else I was
saying was the genetic diversity genetic

1006
00:45:04,021 --> 00:45:05,880
diversity thing each,
each.

1007
00:45:05,881 --> 00:45:08,250
Uh,
each village in Ethiopia has their own

1008
00:45:08,251 --> 00:45:10,620
variety of coffee that they grow
traditionally.

1009
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:13,350
Wow.
How many different varieties are there?

1010
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:14,730
Well,
that's a good question.

1011
00:45:14,731 --> 00:45:17,430
We don't know completely.
They're still doing their scientists

1012
00:45:17,431 --> 00:45:21,570
that are out in Ethiopia right now
trying to count all the different coffee

1013
00:45:21,571 --> 00:45:25,290
varieties.
And the estimation is that there are

1014
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:29,820
somewhere between three and 5,000
different varieties of coffee growing

1015
00:45:29,821 --> 00:45:33,840
wild in Ethiopia and outside of Ethiopia
there was like 30.

1016
00:45:34,410 --> 00:45:35,520
Why?
Yeah.

1017
00:45:35,610 --> 00:45:37,020
Wow.
Yeah,

1018
00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:38,040
it's,
it's crazy.

1019
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:41,350
That's nuts.
So every legit coffee connoisseur is

1020
00:45:41,351 --> 00:45:44,020
like a big fan of Ethiopia.
Do you have like in Ethiopia tee shirt

1021
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:48,290
that you were in the spot?
It's like brazilian jujitsu.

1022
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:49,660
Brazil is the spot,
right?

1023
00:45:49,661 --> 00:45:51,760
So you can pop up the origins center of
origin,

1024
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:53,470
right?
If you want to get into taekwondo,

1025
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:54,580
you go to Korea,
right?

1026
00:45:54,730 --> 00:45:55,990
Yeah.
Wow.

1027
00:45:55,991 --> 00:45:57,660
That's amazing man.
So,

1028
00:45:57,670 --> 00:46:01,510
um,
this particular blend that we had is

1029
00:46:01,511 --> 00:46:05,950
from Ethiopia and um,
what are the variables in ethiopian

1030
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:07,270
coffees?
Like what's,

1031
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:08,350
this is a,
sorry,

1032
00:46:08,351 --> 00:46:09,880
say the name again,
how you said you're a good chef.

1033
00:46:09,910 --> 00:46:14,080
You're a chef and a chef is a fruiTy
floral one,

1034
00:46:14,370 --> 00:46:18,250
but I would assume that with thousands
of different varieties you get a broad

1035
00:46:18,251 --> 00:46:19,870
spectrum of different flavors.
Right?

1036
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:21,230
So,
so in,

1037
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:23,170
so,
uh,

1038
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:27,830
just north of,
of yoga chef is a kind of a larger area.

1039
00:46:27,831 --> 00:46:31,870
And actually you're a chef is within an
area called saddam is the name of the

1040
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:36,890
region and we call coffees from there,
the dominoes dominoes are similar to

1041
00:46:37,731 --> 00:46:40,190
[inaudible] but they're not as floral.
They tend to be sweeter.

1042
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,950
They tasted like honey to me.
So yeah,

1043
00:46:42,951 --> 00:46:43,960
they have a honey,
like,

1044
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:47,900
like what's a good name for one if
someone wants to try one of those sidamo

1045
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:49,010
any,
any sit donald.

1046
00:46:49,011 --> 00:46:50,940
And he spelled out house id.
A,

1047
00:46:50,941 --> 00:46:53,250
m o as any donald?
No.

1048
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:54,460
Pretension.
Damo,

1049
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:55,111
yeah.
Yeah.

1050
00:46:55,111 --> 00:46:56,930
There's different ones that,
that the,

1051
00:46:57,390 --> 00:47:00,690
that names that you get besides sidamo
will often be,

1052
00:47:00,770 --> 00:47:02,070
um,
uh,

1053
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:06,040
or even yoga chef will often be the
specific name of a washing station will

1054
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:09,090
wash the coffee itself.
And uh,

1055
00:47:09,091 --> 00:47:12,570
and so you can get geeky about that.
But sidamo is in what way?

1056
00:47:12,850 --> 00:47:14,910
Well,
you see people develop favorite,

1057
00:47:15,350 --> 00:47:16,700
favorite washing stations.
Yeah.

1058
00:47:16,701 --> 00:47:19,040
Yeah.
And what's the variables in the washing

1059
00:47:19,041 --> 00:47:21,210
process?
Changes the way the flavor is.

1060
00:47:21,211 --> 00:47:21,990
Yeah.
Yeah.

1061
00:47:21,990 --> 00:47:22,950
So,
um,

1062
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:26,310
yeah.
And then I noticed I listened to a

1063
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:29,170
podcast you did recently that had a
nutritionist and you've been talking

1064
00:47:29,171 --> 00:47:31,990
about washing,
washed coffee being important.

1065
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:34,540
Yes.
And I thought I could explain that

1066
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,280
process to you if you want me to.
Yes,

1067
00:47:36,281 --> 00:47:37,114
please.
Okay.

1068
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:42,510
So it's all about how the,
I told you that coffee beans are like

1069
00:47:42,810 --> 00:47:47,590
two seeds inside of the cherry and you
got to get that fruit off because if you

1070
00:47:47,770 --> 00:47:52,770
don't get the fruit off it can mold and
spoil and tastes yucky.

1071
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:56,500
So the whole challenge with coffee is
to,

1072
00:47:56,830 --> 00:48:00,340
is to do something with that fruit layer
before it spoils.

1073
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:01,520
Okay.
And like,

1074
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:03,550
because like any fruits of any kind of
fruit,

1075
00:48:03,551 --> 00:48:05,830
you pick it and then you either you
either do.

1076
00:48:05,831 --> 00:48:10,450
So whaT the ancient ethiopians did is
they just picked it and they set it on

1077
00:48:10,451 --> 00:48:13,980
the ground or on a mat to dry and the
and the,

1078
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:15,000
and the,
the,

1079
00:48:15,330 --> 00:48:17,650
the coffee would sort of turn into
shrivel up,

1080
00:48:17,651 --> 00:48:20,200
turn into a raisin and once it was
totally dry,

1081
00:48:20,201 --> 00:48:24,400
they'd pound it in a mortar and pestle
and the seeds that would separate from

1082
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:26,470
the dried up husk.

1083
00:48:26,950 --> 00:48:29,500
And then you could roast the seeds and
drink the coffee.

1084
00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:31,420
So,
um,

1085
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:34,300
that was the original method of doing
coffee,

1086
00:48:34,301 --> 00:48:37,390
but when they moved coffee from
Ethiopia,

1087
00:48:37,391 --> 00:48:40,180
which is very warm and dry,
and they could,

1088
00:48:40,210 --> 00:48:43,780
they could grow it in Indonesia and in
central America,

1089
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,360
but um,
and it grow fine.

1090
00:48:46,361 --> 00:48:49,840
But when they tried to dry it,
it was tougher because there's more rain

1091
00:48:49,841 --> 00:48:51,660
there,
it's more humid and the coffee would

1092
00:48:51,661 --> 00:48:56,380
mold and get musty and tastes crappy.
So in sent in Costa Rica,

1093
00:48:56,381 --> 00:48:59,530
they invented a different thing.
And what they did was they ran it

1094
00:48:59,531 --> 00:49:02,050
through a machine that would take strip
off the,

1095
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:03,360
the,
the,

1096
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:05,920
the leathery skin.
Yeah,

1097
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:10,000
well the leathery skin,
but it would leave this slimy fruit,

1098
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:11,260
you know,
and it's sort of like,

1099
00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:13,810
you know,
if you eat a peach and some of the

1100
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,700
right,
it sticks to the seed.

1101
00:49:16,090 --> 00:49:17,860
And that's exactly what happens to
coffee.

1102
00:49:17,861 --> 00:49:22,861
It's the sticky fruity stuff is sticking
to the seed and you got to get it off.

1103
00:49:23,531 --> 00:49:27,250
So what they did was they let it ferment
for about a day.

1104
00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:31,780
And if you let that stuff for men in a
bucket or a whatever,

1105
00:49:31,781 --> 00:49:34,640
a tUb for about a day,
then it,

1106
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:37,510
it,
it looSened itself through magic.

1107
00:49:37,511 --> 00:49:38,530
It's like amaziNg.
It's,

1108
00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:39,240
it's,
uh,

1109
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:44,240
the bacterial action and yeasts and
stuff act on that stuff to dissolve it.

1110
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:46,720
And then you can wash it away with
water,

1111
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:48,670
just rinses right off.
That's wet process,

1112
00:49:48,671 --> 00:49:52,030
that's wet processing.
And then once that sticky,

1113
00:49:52,031 --> 00:49:55,000
slimy,
sugary stuff is rinsed away,

1114
00:49:55,330 --> 00:49:58,450
then it's very easy to dry the coffee in
the sun.

1115
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:03,490
It dries in a few days and then you can
husk it and send it for roasting.

1116
00:50:03,890 --> 00:50:07,970
So there's a difference between drying
it out and then roasting.

1117
00:50:07,971 --> 00:50:11,210
It must be dried out first and then it
must be roasted later.

1118
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:11,530
Right?
Right.

1119
00:50:11,530 --> 00:50:12,450
So there's.
Right.

1120
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:16,180
So in those two processes,
those two major processes,

1121
00:50:16,181 --> 00:50:21,181
or we call them either dry processing
and wet processing or the natural method

1122
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:27,380
and the washed method,
so washed and and wet processing the

1123
00:50:27,381 --> 00:50:28,100
same thing

1124
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:31,670
and dried and natural is the same thing.

1125
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:35,740
So.
So in a certain way I'm changing

1126
00:50:35,770 --> 00:50:39,940
climates and moving coffee plants to
other geographic locations.

1127
00:50:40,030 --> 00:50:41,830
Presented a lot of pretty unique
challenges.

1128
00:50:41,950 --> 00:50:44,170
Absolutely.
For coffee they were doing in the 19th

1129
00:50:44,171 --> 00:50:46,540
century it seems so different than
anything else,

1130
00:50:46,570 --> 00:50:48,460
which is also a fruit that you would
grow me.

1131
00:50:48,461 --> 00:50:50,390
You would just take it when it's ripe
and you eat it when it's ripe,

1132
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:53,440
but this seems like a really complicated
thing because what you're doing

1133
00:50:53,950 --> 00:50:56,020
student,
I mean unlike most fruits,

1134
00:50:56,050 --> 00:50:58,210
most fruits aren't cultivated for their
seeds.

1135
00:50:58,490 --> 00:51:03,030
Is there outside of the seed,
the isn't the abstract like the outside

1136
00:51:03,031 --> 00:51:04,560
doesn't have some sort of nutritional
benefit?

1137
00:51:04,590 --> 00:51:05,370
Sure.
Well it's,

1138
00:51:05,370 --> 00:51:06,660
I mean it's,
it's a fruit,

1139
00:51:06,661 --> 00:51:09,240
it's got sugar and it's got.
What does it taste like?

1140
00:51:09,510 --> 00:51:13,590
It tastes like I'm a.
I always say it's like a mixture of,

1141
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:17,390
of watermelon and a jasmine real.
Yeah,

1142
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,100
it's beautiful.
It sounds delicious.

1143
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:20,430
Delicious.
It's totally delicious.

1144
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:24,030
You can't just buy coffee fruit.
Well you can.

1145
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:28,740
The problem is that if they.
Coffee doesn't really grow around here.

1146
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:30,390
Right?
So by the time they got it to you,

1147
00:51:30,391 --> 00:51:32,610
it'd be spoiled.
What do they do?

1148
00:51:32,611 --> 00:51:34,710
Here's a few things for you and I should
have brought some for you.

1149
00:51:34,711 --> 00:51:35,544
They,
they,

1150
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:40,600
some places they keep the fruit that
they husk off and they drive that to a

1151
00:51:40,950 --> 00:51:45,420
and you can make sort of like a beverage
out of that by soaking that beverage in

1152
00:51:45,421 --> 00:51:46,980
water,
treating it like tea.

1153
00:51:47,850 --> 00:51:51,160
And they do that in Ethiopia and in
Yemen they call it has shara and Yemen.

1154
00:51:51,190 --> 00:51:52,740
They call it kesher.
And in,

1155
00:51:52,890 --> 00:51:54,390
in,
I mean sharon,

1156
00:51:54,391 --> 00:51:55,770
Ethiopia,
Kenya and Yemen.

1157
00:51:56,460 --> 00:52:01,460
And so it's another beverage that comes
from coffee and it's sweet and it's got

1158
00:52:01,830 --> 00:52:03,840
plenty of caffeine.
Really?

1159
00:52:03,841 --> 00:52:04,950
Yeah.
And uh,

1160
00:52:05,170 --> 00:52:07,670
and then more popular it seems like
that'd be more popular.

1161
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,960
It's interesting.
you would think that that would be maybe

1162
00:52:09,961 --> 00:52:11,070
this new thing.
It's kind of.

1163
00:52:11,071 --> 00:52:12,720
Yeah.
What do you call it again?

1164
00:52:12,810 --> 00:52:15,390
Well,
a lot of places that sell it here,

1165
00:52:15,391 --> 00:52:16,860
call it c,
a,

1166
00:52:16,861 --> 00:52:17,251
s,
c,

1167
00:52:17,251 --> 00:52:18,960
a r a.
That's the spanish word for it.

1168
00:52:19,030 --> 00:52:20,460
Yeah.
Scada that now.

1169
00:52:20,461 --> 00:52:22,410
Is that what you said?
Starbucks could start selling.

1170
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:23,070
They could,
yeah.

1171
00:52:23,070 --> 00:52:24,290
Why don't they do that?
That's a good question.

1172
00:52:24,310 --> 00:52:25,350
Fuck's wrong with you?
Starbucks.

1173
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:27,270
Get on the ball.
Then she bitches like money.

1174
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:29,760
But like there's some,
there's other coffee companies sell it

1175
00:52:29,910 --> 00:52:31,090
and it's good.
Yeah.

1176
00:52:31,091 --> 00:52:31,950
It's,
it's kind of an,

1177
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:34,680
it's not satisfying in the same way that
coffee is,

1178
00:52:34,681 --> 00:52:37,050
it's kind of an oddity you'll,
you'll try it.

1179
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:37,980
Yeah,
I certainly will.

1180
00:52:37,981 --> 00:52:39,030
Yeah.
You tell me what that sounds

1181
00:52:39,031 --> 00:52:40,140
interesting.
Coskata.

1182
00:52:40,170 --> 00:52:41,790
Okay.
I gotta remember that now.

1183
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:46,040
The,
the actual beiNg itself.

1184
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:49,820
Is there more caffeine in the fruity
outer layer or is there more caffeine in

1185
00:52:49,821 --> 00:52:50,790
the bean itself?
I don't know

1186
00:52:50,790 --> 00:52:51,770
the answer to that.
Okay.

1187
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:56,100
But there's theory and there's coffee.
That's true.

1188
00:52:56,101 --> 00:52:57,030
It varies.
And the,

1189
00:52:57,050 --> 00:52:59,830
and uh,
there's caffeine in all parts of the,

1190
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:01,890
the coffee plant,
the leaves,

1191
00:53:01,891 --> 00:53:02,521
everything.
Yeah.

1192
00:53:02,521 --> 00:53:04,930
It's there and everybody even look like
I don't even know what it looks.

1193
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:06,390
Um,
it's about,

1194
00:53:06,510 --> 00:53:08,850
well,
it depends on the variety of coffee,

1195
00:53:08,851 --> 00:53:12,480
but generally they're about eight feet
tall at the bush.

1196
00:53:12,481 --> 00:53:14,280
Yeah.
All I know about that as now that I'm

1197
00:53:14,281 --> 00:53:16,230
realizing it's fucking Juan Valdez,
man.

1198
00:53:16,650 --> 00:53:20,010
Juan valdez.
The only why they did they really got

1199
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:22,920
attached to that burrow and him with his
coffee beans.

1200
00:53:22,921 --> 00:53:23,640
Yeah,
absolutely.

1201
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:25,650
Yeah.
How odd now

1202
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:30,840
is there a variation in the caffeine
content of beans from one part of the

1203
00:53:30,841 --> 00:53:34,140
world to the other?
Because I've seen something called

1204
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:39,900
kicking horse that was called kicking
horse coffee claims to have super

1205
00:53:39,901 --> 00:53:41,580
excessive amount of caffeine.

1206
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:42,500
Yeah,
I,

1207
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:43,600
well,
I don't know that brand,

1208
00:53:43,601 --> 00:53:47,560
but what they might be talking about is
there's another species of coffee.

1209
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:51,250
So I'm.
so there's the species that we've been

1210
00:53:51,251 --> 00:53:54,250
talking about from Ethiopia and all that
stuff is called cafe.

1211
00:53:54,310 --> 00:53:56,470
Arabica is the name of that spa.
Okay.

1212
00:53:56,610 --> 00:54:01,610
So theRe's another species that comes
from the western part of africa and um,

1213
00:54:02,410 --> 00:54:05,740
it's called cafe canephora,
but we call it robust.

1214
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:07,220
Have you ever heard of her breasts?
Okay.

1215
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:09,610
So robust.
It comes from west africa.

1216
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:12,490
It doesn't taste as good generally.
Um,

1217
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:13,480
it's uh,
it,

1218
00:54:13,570 --> 00:54:15,760
it's sort of my,
in my experience,

1219
00:54:15,761 --> 00:54:17,490
it tastes like burnt popcorn,
you know,

1220
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:19,720
you know,
cheap diner coffee has that burden,

1221
00:54:19,721 --> 00:54:22,960
popcorn kind of taste to it.
That's from the robust data in it.

1222
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:26,270
And they've used burnt popcorn.
Yeah.

1223
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:29,420
Rubber star diner in white plains,
dr.

1224
00:54:29,421 --> 00:54:31,130
Totally.
I used to eat it this fucking place.

1225
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:33,950
Their coffee was just always like burnt
popcorn.

1226
00:54:33,951 --> 00:54:36,380
I didn't even thought of that,
but it tasted like shit.

1227
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:38,540
Yeah.
So that's the robusta in it.

1228
00:54:39,050 --> 00:54:41,210
Never bust.
That has a lot more caffeine than,

1229
00:54:41,390 --> 00:54:43,130
than,
than arabica does.

1230
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:45,860
No kidding.
But it also has a bunch of other

1231
00:54:45,861 --> 00:54:48,890
chemicals that don't taste very good.
uh,

1232
00:54:48,891 --> 00:54:52,010
so that's why it's got such a jolt to,
it tastes like shit.

1233
00:54:52,011 --> 00:54:52,410
So some

1234
00:54:52,410 --> 00:54:55,180
people I've seen people talk about high,
you know,

1235
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:58,220
high caffeine coffee and they're just
using robust enough to sort of,

1236
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:00,950
to sort of amp up the,
the,

1237
00:55:00,970 --> 00:55:02,440
uh,
the,

1238
00:55:02,570 --> 00:55:04,040
the caffeine level,

1239
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:07,170
let's I think floating around.
That's the scoop scoop.

1240
00:55:07,190 --> 00:55:10,670
I didn't take it up and jamie were
drinking plastic soup here.

1241
00:55:10,671 --> 00:55:12,070
Um,
the uh,

1242
00:55:12,870 --> 00:55:15,610
but you know,
I mean obviously caffeine is an

1243
00:55:15,611 --> 00:55:19,230
important part of the deal without it
the fit,

1244
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:20,740
let's be honest,
this is a drug.

1245
00:55:21,430 --> 00:55:25,540
The ride wouldn't be nearly as a line
list nearly as long.

1246
00:55:25,570 --> 00:55:26,340
It's true.
Yeah.

1247
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:27,173
But,
but

1248
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:30,040
after that,
once you've satisfied the caffeine,

1249
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:31,033
you know,
part,

1250
00:55:31,630 --> 00:55:34,480
um,
you start drinking coffee for what it

1251
00:55:34,481 --> 00:55:39,481
tastes like and so,
and so people that are focused on coffee

1252
00:55:41,081 --> 00:55:45,390
flavor tend to deemphasize the jolt part
and,

1253
00:55:45,850 --> 00:55:47,310
and emphasize

1254
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:48,470
the flavor,
the flavor part.

1255
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:49,990
What is the,
the orange,

1256
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:52,610
why does the plant produce caffeine in
the first place?

1257
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:54,200
Is that we know that?
Yeah,

1258
00:55:54,201 --> 00:55:54,830
it's an

1259
00:55:54,830 --> 00:55:56,830
called an alkaloid is the,
is the,

1260
00:55:57,070 --> 00:55:57,903
is the,
uh,

1261
00:55:57,970 --> 00:55:59,830
class of chemical.
The caffeine is.

1262
00:56:00,070 --> 00:56:02,410
And uh,
and there's,

1263
00:56:02,770 --> 00:56:05,410
in general,
plants seem to,

1264
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:09,610
to produce alkaloids to drive away,
um,

1265
00:56:09,670 --> 00:56:10,540
predation.
Yeah,

1266
00:56:10,541 --> 00:56:12,070
like insects and stuff like that.

1267
00:56:12,130 --> 00:56:14,830
Okay.
so the insects eat the coffee,

1268
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:19,630
have a fucking heart attack,
follow scott that's toxIc to insects at

1269
00:56:19,631 --> 00:56:21,580
a micro level.
So the animals,

1270
00:56:21,581 --> 00:56:22,740
a lot of animals as well.
Right?

1271
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:25,840
But from what I understand,
that's the reason why dogs don't like

1272
00:56:25,841 --> 00:56:27,550
chocolate.
We shouLd feed your dog chocolate.

1273
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:30,640
It's another alkaloid called
theobromine.

1274
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:32,380
So,
um,

1275
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,420
so theobromine
chocolate has and it's very similar to

1276
00:56:37,421 --> 00:56:40,210
caffeine.
It'll make you your heart.

1277
00:56:40,950 --> 00:56:42,430
You know,
and I talked to a veterinarian about

1278
00:56:42,431 --> 00:56:45,910
this once and the problem with,
with dogs is they eat a bunch of

1279
00:56:45,911 --> 00:56:48,520
chocolate and their heart pounds so
fast.

1280
00:56:48,521 --> 00:56:49,900
They have a heart attack.
Yeah.

1281
00:56:50,170 --> 00:56:51,130
From the,
from the,

1282
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:52,353
from the,
uh,

1283
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:55,060
theobromine and it's like caffeine and
in,

1284
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:56,110
you know,
people say that,

1285
00:56:56,590 --> 00:56:58,570
that uh,
the chocolate has caffeine,

1286
00:56:58,990 --> 00:57:01,480
that active thing is actually feel
bromine,

1287
00:57:01,481 --> 00:57:02,314
which is.

1288
00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:04,530
So it's an alkaloid,
it's very similar.

1289
00:57:04,590 --> 00:57:07,920
It's a stimulant that works on dogs in a
different way that it works on humans.

1290
00:57:07,921 --> 00:57:08,591
Yeah.
Yeah.

1291
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:10,260
It's the dogs are more susceptible to
it.

1292
00:57:10,350 --> 00:57:14,460
That's fascinating because in humans it
actually has some weird like

1293
00:57:14,461 --> 00:57:16,050
representation of love.
Right?

1294
00:57:16,051 --> 00:57:18,110
It gives a very similar,
if they say yeah.

1295
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:19,500
Yeah,
just kind of makes sense.

1296
00:57:19,501 --> 00:57:20,820
Right?
They give chocolate to people.

1297
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:23,280
Yeah.
Then that's what they say.

1298
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:24,173
Yeah.
I mean,

1299
00:57:24,210 --> 00:57:25,080
my,
myself,

1300
00:57:25,081 --> 00:57:26,970
if I drink,
if I eat too much chocolate,

1301
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:29,050
my heart pounds,
I can feel it much,

1302
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:30,000
much more than.

1303
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:30,781
Well,
you're a hairy dude.

1304
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:33,970
You're probably much more animal.
Like a.

1305
00:57:34,070 --> 00:57:38,400
There was a recent article that I was
reading today online about chocolate.

1306
00:57:38,670 --> 00:57:43,470
That chocolate is going to be extremely
rare in the future because of our,

1307
00:57:43,471 --> 00:57:45,420
um,
our overconsumption of chocolate.

1308
00:57:45,421 --> 00:57:48,540
We consume so much chocolate.
They can't keep up with the production.

1309
00:57:48,570 --> 00:57:50,640
The demand can't keep up,
keep up with the production

1310
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:54,340
and they've got a similar product,
project problem that coffee does.

1311
00:57:54,430 --> 00:57:57,340
So,
so genetic problem or genetic problem

1312
00:57:57,580 --> 00:57:58,840
and,
and uh,

1313
00:57:59,110 --> 00:58:01,360
and the same.
Okay.

1314
00:58:01,361 --> 00:58:04,840
So chocolate is indigenous to south
America.

1315
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:08,950
I'm like,
coffee is indigenous to africa.

1316
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:14,460
A cacao is from latin America and uh,
but then it's been spread all over the

1317
00:58:15,491 --> 00:58:18,730
world has a narrow genetic base.
I mean,

1318
00:58:18,731 --> 00:58:22,000
all these tropical crops have these,
have these problems.

1319
00:58:22,001 --> 00:58:25,700
The other problem is climate change.
Um,

1320
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:28,900
you know,
as the climate gets warmer,

1321
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:30,000
these,
the,

1322
00:58:30,190 --> 00:58:33,520
the,
the suitable kind of environment for

1323
00:58:33,521 --> 00:58:38,521
these very climate,
very temperature intolerant plants,

1324
00:58:40,630 --> 00:58:44,990
narrows diseases spread more easily,
etc. Etc.

1325
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:45,880
It's a problem

1326
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:49,660
that is very interesting.
So you said that coffee can't be grown

1327
00:58:49,661 --> 00:58:50,620
in the United States?

1328
00:58:50,750 --> 00:58:51,583
Well,
it can.

1329
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:53,390
Mainly.
Hawaii is in the United States,

1330
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:55,340
in Hawaii.
Um,

1331
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:57,710
there is also one farm here in
California,

1332
00:58:57,740 --> 00:58:59,390
really up in santa barbara.
It's not far.

1333
00:58:59,391 --> 00:59:01,220
You can drive here in santa barbara.
Yeah.

1334
00:59:01,430 --> 00:59:02,810
How's their coffee?
Delicious.

1335
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:03,410
Real?
Yeah.

1336
00:59:03,410 --> 00:59:05,660
And heat.
But he only planted this farm a few

1337
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:06,441
years ago.
No shit.

1338
00:59:06,441 --> 00:59:08,090
Yeah,
it's called good land organics.

1339
00:59:08,250 --> 00:59:12,000
So he's the only guy in America and
these growing coffee in the lower 48.

1340
00:59:12,001 --> 00:59:12,520
Yeah.
Yep.

1341
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:15,820
And it's because he's in a very unique
kind of microclimate there.

1342
00:59:15,821 --> 00:59:17,650
There's actually,
if you go to his farm,

1343
00:59:17,651 --> 00:59:21,170
it can be warmer at night on this farm
than it is during the day because of the

1344
00:59:21,171 --> 00:59:24,260
weird way that the weather works around
their santa barbara's paradise.

1345
00:59:24,290 --> 00:59:25,130
It is,
it's beautiful.

1346
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:26,930
It's amaZing.
This place you should,

1347
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:31,250
you should go to this farm should.
He also grows amazing fruits like,

1348
00:59:31,251 --> 00:59:32,070
uh,
these,

1349
00:59:32,070 --> 00:59:36,170
these crazy australian lines called
finger limes that are looked like caviar

1350
00:59:36,171 --> 00:59:38,930
inside chair.
A moya says.

1351
00:59:38,931 --> 00:59:39,840
Have you ever heard of chairman?
Yes,

1352
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:41,540
they are very rare.
Tropical fruit.

1353
00:59:42,290 --> 00:59:43,240
No.
Never heard of that.

1354
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:45,350
Grows all these insane fruits.
Wow.

1355
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:48,470
What's the name of his place?
Good land organics.

1356
00:59:49,370 --> 00:59:51,350
That's pretty cool that he's the guy
that,

1357
00:59:51,351 --> 00:59:54,630
uh,
figures out how to grow coffee autos.

1358
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:57,020
He has there.
So there's a lot of avocados in santa

1359
00:59:57,021 --> 00:59:57,960
barbara.
So he,

1360
00:59:57,990 --> 00:59:58,370
he,

1361
00:59:58,370 --> 00:59:59,870
he got this avocado.
He's a,

1362
01:00:00,050 --> 01:00:04,970
he's a guy from hearing it.
I think it came from the here in la and

1363
01:00:04,971 --> 01:00:07,940
he got into agriculture and he bought
this farm that was an avocado farm.

1364
01:00:07,941 --> 01:00:09,950
But then he started planting dragon
fruit.

1365
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:15,650
These finger limes.
I'm ciara moya is all this stuff and he

1366
01:00:15,651 --> 01:00:18,470
grows coffee there.
Um,

1367
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:22,460
and he just like a really good fruit
grower and he grabbed his coffee and,

1368
01:00:22,550 --> 01:00:23,790
and he,
uh,

1369
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:27,230
uh,
he was telling me recently he's,

1370
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:28,810
I mean,
this coffee that he grew,

1371
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:30,710
he's planted the right varieties of
coffee,

1372
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:34,100
including this one,
the moca variety that has these little

1373
01:00:34,101 --> 01:00:35,770
tiny beans.
Um,

1374
01:00:35,810 --> 01:00:39,710
he's got that growing there,
etc. And it's just now coming into

1375
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:40,850
fruit.
You know,

1376
01:00:40,850 --> 01:00:43,490
one of the interesting things about
coffee as you plant a coffee seed,

1377
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:47,960
you don't start to harvest coffee from
between three and seven years after you

1378
01:00:48,070 --> 01:00:49,010
planted.
Wow.

1379
01:00:49,050 --> 01:00:52,870
So he's just now starting to reap the
rewards of all these years and years of

1380
01:00:52,871 --> 01:00:55,610
taking care of plants.
That is fascinating.

1381
01:00:55,611 --> 01:00:56,444
Yeah.
Dude,

1382
01:00:56,470 --> 01:00:58,930
you should grow coffee.
You love it so much.

1383
01:00:59,710 --> 01:01:01,540
Why are you not involved in growing it?
Well,

1384
01:01:01,541 --> 01:01:04,750
yeah,
maybe someday spot in santa barbara,

1385
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:08,680
a small patch of land in santa barbara
and let the party begin.

1386
01:01:08,730 --> 01:01:09,540
I would love it.
I,

1387
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:12,090
I've,
I've always traveled too much to like be

1388
01:01:12,091 --> 01:01:12,960
at a,
at a farm.

1389
01:01:12,961 --> 01:01:14,910
So I mean,
I've spent the last

1390
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:20,190
15 or so years just traveling to coffee
farms all over the world,

1391
01:01:20,220 --> 01:01:22,980
working with coffee farmers to get their
quality better and,

1392
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:23,933
and,
uh,

1393
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:27,960
and kind of learn about all this stuff
because that's kind of a new phenomenon

1394
01:01:27,961 --> 01:01:31,950
to his,
his coffee roasting companies that are

1395
01:01:32,010 --> 01:01:35,280
interacting more directly with farmers
and getting the,

1396
01:01:35,730 --> 01:01:38,130
you know,
getting the quality thing really worked

1397
01:01:38,131 --> 01:01:39,150
out.
UnderstandIng,

1398
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:42,100
um,
what makes coffee grade.

1399
01:01:42,101 --> 01:01:42,200
Yeah.

1400
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:45,680
So most farmers that are growing coffee
the,

1401
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:49,610
are they doing it just for a profit or
there's other places where you go in

1402
01:01:49,611 --> 01:01:50,750
there,
real artisans.

1403
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:55,480
Is there a broad variation?
It's mostly the first thing because most

1404
01:01:55,481 --> 01:01:56,510
of the artisans.
No,

1405
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:56,750
no,
no,

1406
01:01:56,750 --> 01:01:58,760
it's mostly businesses.
It's mostly,

1407
01:01:58,940 --> 01:01:59,773
well it's mostly the

1408
01:01:59,810 --> 01:02:03,020
small farmers struggling to get by.
So,

1409
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:05,910
so going back to the history,
so the dutch,

1410
01:02:05,911 --> 01:02:08,910
you know,
they planted their thing in java and

1411
01:02:08,911 --> 01:02:11,670
they basically enslave the local
population to work on their,

1412
01:02:11,970 --> 01:02:13,690
on their coffee farms.
This is in the,

1413
01:02:13,770 --> 01:02:15,780
you know,
in the 18th century,

1414
01:02:16,870 --> 01:02:17,940
the,
everybody was,

1415
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,180
all the european were trying to get
colonies everywhere.

1416
01:02:21,210 --> 01:02:22,310
So,
you know,

1417
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:24,570
colonies,
the spanish during their colonies in

1418
01:02:24,571 --> 01:02:27,180
central America,
the french doing their colonies.

1419
01:02:27,181 --> 01:02:32,181
And in west africa,
the english we're trying to colonize

1420
01:02:32,341 --> 01:02:33,720
Kenya,
the,

1421
01:02:34,110 --> 01:02:34,943
the,
uh,

1422
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:37,440
the,
the dutch were colonized east India and

1423
01:02:37,441 --> 01:02:39,090
they,
they kind of enslaved the local

1424
01:02:39,091 --> 01:02:42,240
population to grow coffee and,
and,

1425
01:02:42,810 --> 01:02:43,950
and so,
uh,

1426
01:02:44,370 --> 01:02:46,160
and so that was sort of a dark period
in,

1427
01:02:46,290 --> 01:02:50,340
in world history.
And unfortunately coffee was part of

1428
01:02:50,341 --> 01:02:52,680
that.
But since then,

1429
01:02:52,681 --> 01:02:53,640
so then,
you know,

1430
01:02:53,641 --> 01:02:58,110
the enlightenment happened.
A democracies started to spread around

1431
01:02:58,111 --> 01:03:00,330
the world,
but still many of these countries that

1432
01:03:00,331 --> 01:03:05,331
were former former colonies were,
had poverty problems like central

1433
01:03:05,521 --> 01:03:06,750
America and stuff like that.

1434
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:10,380
Um,
the place that I started first started

1435
01:03:10,410 --> 01:03:14,520
working with coffee farmers was in
Nicaragua and in Nicaragua was formerly

1436
01:03:14,521 --> 01:03:15,510
a colony,
you know,

1437
01:03:15,511 --> 01:03:16,344
and,
and,

1438
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:19,380
and had that problem,
but then they had the revolution.

1439
01:03:19,381 --> 01:03:20,520
They,
they,

1440
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:23,760
uh,
they dissolved a lot of these big farms

1441
01:03:23,761 --> 01:03:28,761
and gave little parcels of land to a lot
of people that used to work on the farm.

1442
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,840
So here you have all these people that
used to work on a farm that now have

1443
01:03:33,841 --> 01:03:38,841
their little tiny farm of them have
their own and that's cool because then

1444
01:03:39,361 --> 01:03:40,141
they've got,
you know,

1445
01:03:40,141 --> 01:03:42,890
they've got their own business,
their farm that's going.

1446
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:45,960
The problem is it's pretty tough in any
country,

1447
01:03:45,961 --> 01:03:48,720
whether it's the United States or
Nicaragua or anywhere to make a small

1448
01:03:48,721 --> 01:03:51,450
farm profitable.
And so in many,

1449
01:03:51,630 --> 01:03:54,780
many parts of the world,
you've got small farmers that are just

1450
01:03:54,781 --> 01:03:56,220
trying to get by,
you know,

1451
01:03:56,221 --> 01:03:59,100
and put food on their plate.
And so one of the,

1452
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:04,140
one of the great things that coffee that
special coffee companies can do is get

1453
01:04:04,141 --> 01:04:06,660
engaged with those farmers and try to
get the,

1454
01:04:06,860 --> 01:04:08,760
the,
celebrate the product,

1455
01:04:08,761 --> 01:04:13,761
get people to pay more for it because it
tastes really delicious and it becomes a

1456
01:04:14,251 --> 01:04:17,640
better livelihood for farmers all,
uh,

1457
01:04:18,420 --> 01:04:19,440
all across the world.

1458
01:04:19,770 --> 01:04:22,680
So your friend in santa barbara,
what was his name again that owns this

1459
01:04:22,681 --> 01:04:23,970
place?
J rescue is his.

1460
01:04:23,971 --> 01:04:26,200
And what's the name of the place again?
Good land organics.

1461
01:04:26,250 --> 01:04:30,540
And so he's just a guy who loves coffee
and decides I'm going to try to grow

1462
01:04:30,541 --> 01:04:32,070
some stuff in santa barbara.
It's growing.

1463
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:34,110
He's,
he loves agriculture growing.

1464
01:04:34,111 --> 01:04:35,760
And he thought it was a challenge to
grow coffee,

1465
01:04:35,761 --> 01:04:37,590
I think.
I think he loves coffee too,

1466
01:04:37,591 --> 01:04:40,980
but I think really he loved the fact
that it was a challenge to the likes,

1467
01:04:40,981 --> 01:04:45,540
these unusual fruits.
So it kind of takes a person with a sort

1468
01:04:45,541 --> 01:04:48,750
of a deep commitment to,
to make something like this take place.

1469
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,890
Otherwise it's a pretty significant
investment in time and effort before you

1470
01:04:52,891 --> 01:04:54,590
reap any rewards.
And there are those people

1471
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:56,110
two in coffee.
I mean even in,

1472
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:56,740
you know,
in,

1473
01:04:56,740 --> 01:04:57,573
in,
uh,

1474
01:04:57,700 --> 01:05:02,700
El Salvador and Guatemala.
I'm in Panama in Brazil.

1475
01:05:03,250 --> 01:05:07,390
I know if I know of like amazing farmers
and all of these places who are like

1476
01:05:08,110 --> 01:05:12,070
focused on like making the best
imaginable coffee.

1477
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:16,540
So now when you work with these people,
say if somebody contacts you and say,

1478
01:05:16,541 --> 01:05:18,040
peter,
I know what the fuck I'm doing.

1479
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:19,970
Come down here and help me grow some
bitch and coffee.

1480
01:05:19,971 --> 01:05:22,150
Yeah.
What is your process like?

1481
01:05:22,151 --> 01:05:25,120
Let's say a guy from Hawaii calls you
up,

1482
01:05:25,390 --> 01:05:26,650
says,
I want to grow some coffee.

1483
01:05:26,651 --> 01:05:27,484
I don't know what I'm doing.

1484
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:30,860
Yeah,
well coffee is kind of an unusual.

1485
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:32,930
I mean,
Hawaii is kind of an unusual situation

1486
01:05:32,931 --> 01:05:35,900
because the university of Hawaii is
involved and they can actually call it

1487
01:05:35,901 --> 01:05:37,490
the university of Hawaii and get.
So they wouldn't,

1488
01:05:38,150 --> 01:05:38,860
they wouldn't need me.

1489
01:05:38,860 --> 01:05:40,360
Okay.
So where would they need you at south

1490
01:05:40,361 --> 01:05:43,460
America?
Peru.

1491
01:05:44,660 --> 01:05:45,760
busted for cocaine

1492
01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:47,191
the first.
Yeah.

1493
01:05:47,191 --> 01:05:48,700
And Peru.
I've done a lot of work in Peru and

1494
01:05:48,701 --> 01:05:50,980
Bolivia and,
and uh,

1495
01:05:50,981 --> 01:05:53,110
and not just me.
I mean there's lots of choice.

1496
01:05:53,111 --> 01:05:55,390
Lots of,
of people out there and,

1497
01:05:55,450 --> 01:05:57,970
and,
and in fact that the us government

1498
01:05:57,971 --> 01:06:01,660
through usa id is out there trying to
give a,

1499
01:06:01,930 --> 01:06:04,990
give good support to these guys.
The first thing you do is you teAch,

1500
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:08,170
teach them to taste coffee and
amazingly,

1501
01:06:08,590 --> 01:06:11,770
and some of your listeners may may have
had this experience.

1502
01:06:11,771 --> 01:06:15,660
I've had this experience.
You go to wherever and Nicaragua,

1503
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:19,000
Costa Rica,
Peru or whatever place that's famous for

1504
01:06:19,001 --> 01:06:23,140
its coffee and you go into the hotel and
they've got nice cafe and the instant

1505
01:06:23,141 --> 01:06:28,141
coffee in the restaurant or whatever.
And it's because a lot of these places,

1506
01:06:28,570 --> 01:06:31,690
people don't drink the coffee,
they grow the coffee,

1507
01:06:31,691 --> 01:06:32,524
but they don't drink it.

1508
01:06:33,110 --> 01:06:34,710
And it's crazy.
That's so weird.

1509
01:06:34,711 --> 01:06:36,210
totally weird.
How's that happen?

1510
01:06:36,630 --> 01:06:40,590
Because it's more valuable to export so
they don't drink it just because it's

1511
01:06:40,591 --> 01:06:41,610
not worth it.
It's worth it.

1512
01:06:41,611 --> 01:06:43,680
That's part of the culture that's
interesting now.

1513
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:46,290
So not part of the culture yet.
It is,

1514
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:48,960
it is.
It's part of the agricultural culture,

1515
01:06:48,990 --> 01:06:51,060
but it's not part of the consumption
culture.

1516
01:06:51,580 --> 01:06:52,740
It's weird.
Okay.

1517
01:06:52,890 --> 01:06:56,950
A Ethiopia is the only place in Brazil
to some extent,

1518
01:06:57,430 --> 01:06:59,950
um,
where they drink coffee as much as they,

1519
01:07:00,370 --> 01:07:01,610
as they,
as they exit

1520
01:07:01,690 --> 01:07:03,400
47.
Brazil has the same issue.

1521
01:07:03,401 --> 01:07:06,430
The rest of south America where they
have a very limited genetics.

1522
01:07:06,431 --> 01:07:10,360
And is that the same or different?
Because Brazil is so much bigger,

1523
01:07:10,870 --> 01:07:14,980
but they're more than one variety from
Russia in general.

1524
01:07:15,070 --> 01:07:16,300
But um,
and,

1525
01:07:16,470 --> 01:07:17,740
and all of these countries,
by the way,

1526
01:07:17,741 --> 01:07:20,470
are aware of this problem and they're
trying to diversify their genetics.

1527
01:07:20,471 --> 01:07:23,800
So do they contact you through the
coffee website?

1528
01:07:23,900 --> 01:07:26,950
Is specialty coffee association of
America

1529
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:28,260
in the,
in the,

1530
01:07:28,261 --> 01:07:29,160
uh,
yeah,

1531
01:07:29,190 --> 01:07:30,640
so in the,
uh,

1532
01:07:32,220 --> 01:07:35,340
about starting in 2000 or so we,
we,

1533
01:07:35,341 --> 01:07:39,960
uh,
we in our group that were affiliated

1534
01:07:39,961 --> 01:07:41,640
with,
called the coffee quality institute,

1535
01:07:42,530 --> 01:07:46,260
put had this program called coffee core.
It's sorta like the peace corps for

1536
01:07:46,261 --> 01:07:49,080
coffee people and guys like me would,
would,

1537
01:07:49,081 --> 01:07:51,870
uh,
would sign up and volunteer for two

1538
01:07:51,871 --> 01:07:54,630
weeks to serve in a coffee farming
community.

1539
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:57,540
And if we had a skiLL,
we might have marketing skill or,

1540
01:07:57,990 --> 01:07:58,823
or,
uh,

1541
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:01,840
aCcounting or tasting.
My,

1542
01:08:01,870 --> 01:08:04,570
my Skill was tasting.
So I would go down,

1543
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:09,270
I would teach a coffee cooperative in El
Salvador.

1544
01:08:09,300 --> 01:08:10,350
Do you speak spanish?
yes.

1545
01:08:10,430 --> 01:08:11,220
Oh,
okay.

1546
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:14,310
How to taste their coffee and taste it
like we do,

1547
01:08:14,530 --> 01:08:17,570
you know,
look for things like sweetness and

1548
01:08:17,780 --> 01:08:21,860
flavor and aroma and stuff like that.
And just that is like extremely powerful

1549
01:08:21,861 --> 01:08:25,550
because if you're running a coffee farm
and you and you know how to taste it,

1550
01:08:25,551 --> 01:08:28,460
like your buyer is going to taste it and
then you can say,

1551
01:08:28,461 --> 01:08:29,870
all right,
this case,

1552
01:08:29,871 --> 01:08:32,150
it's better.
I'm going To do this,

1553
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:35,360
I'm going to grow it this way,
I'm going to dry it this way,

1554
01:08:35,361 --> 01:08:37,040
I'm going to ferment it this way,
etc.

1555
01:08:37,330 --> 01:08:40,510
Now when you say grow it this way,
what are the variables involved in

1556
01:08:40,511 --> 01:08:43,990
changing the flavor of coffee?
Is it just climate or is it the soil

1557
01:08:44,020 --> 01:08:48,490
content or is it something that you add
to the soil the way you water them?

1558
01:08:48,491 --> 01:08:49,181
What do you do?
Well,

1559
01:08:49,181 --> 01:08:49,610
most of them

1560
01:08:49,610 --> 01:08:53,680
biggest thing is the climate and a lot
of that is determined by altitudes.

1561
01:08:53,681 --> 01:08:57,370
So remember mrs.
Mrs. Owen on folgers.

1562
01:08:57,371 --> 01:08:58,720
What was the lady?
I don't know.

1563
01:08:58,780 --> 01:08:59,650
Anyway,
I'm a commercial.

1564
01:08:59,651 --> 01:09:02,440
She used to say mountain grown folgers.
Oh that's right.

1565
01:09:02,441 --> 01:09:03,240
Yeah.
So,

1566
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:05,410
uh,
and That's because coffee likes to be at

1567
01:09:05,411 --> 01:09:07,840
high altitudes.
So in general,

1568
01:09:07,841 --> 01:09:11,770
the higher the altitude the farm is,
the better the coffee and then.

1569
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:14,040
But a farmer has no control over the
altitude of their,

1570
01:09:14,180 --> 01:09:17,320
their farm,
but what they can control is how much

1571
01:09:17,321 --> 01:09:18,910
shade that the,
uh,

1572
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:23,800
the coffee gets.
So they plant trees next to the coffee

1573
01:09:23,801 --> 01:09:25,570
to actually provide some shade for it.

1574
01:09:25,950 --> 01:09:27,900
Really.
So they have coffee and they're like oak

1575
01:09:27,901 --> 01:09:29,010
trees or some shit.
Yeah.

1576
01:09:29,190 --> 01:09:30,630
Yeah.
Usually it's a different.

1577
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:33,900
They're different.
They're like latin american indigenous,

1578
01:09:34,010 --> 01:09:36,560
something that large leaves shady.

1579
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:37,630
Yeah.
And,

1580
01:09:37,660 --> 01:09:38,493
and,
uh,

1581
01:09:38,650 --> 01:09:43,410
and sometimes it's a fruit tree so they
can get fruit as well from the or other

1582
01:09:43,810 --> 01:09:45,760
j is avocados in,
in,

1583
01:09:45,761 --> 01:09:46,810
uh,
in santa barbara for this.

1584
01:09:47,190 --> 01:09:47,881
Wow.
Okay.

1585
01:09:47,881 --> 01:09:50,720
So he grows his avocado trees and then
sandwiches them inbetween.

1586
01:09:50,790 --> 01:09:52,000
Yeah,
exactly.

1587
01:09:52,001 --> 01:09:52,360
So,

1588
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:57,360
so the deal is
the coffee now a shaded coffee.

1589
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:01,850
So coffee evolved under other trees.
It's called an understory shrub.

1590
01:10:01,851 --> 01:10:02,620
It,
it,

1591
01:10:02,620 --> 01:10:05,470
it naturally likes to be protected by
the trees.

1592
01:10:06,010 --> 01:10:07,600
However,
if you take it out and put it in the

1593
01:10:07,601 --> 01:10:09,220
full sun,
it will be more productive.

1594
01:10:09,430 --> 01:10:12,610
It'll produce a lot more coffee.
But in general that coffee won't be as

1595
01:10:12,611 --> 01:10:16,330
good.
So if a farmer has to like figure out

1596
01:10:16,690 --> 01:10:18,190
the benefit,
you know,

1597
01:10:18,340 --> 01:10:20,470
it it,
if he puts it in shade,

1598
01:10:20,471 --> 01:10:24,430
the coffee will taste better,
but it won't be as productive.

1599
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:29,050
So he has to sort of balance and that's,
that's what happens in coffee all the

1600
01:10:29,051 --> 01:10:30,020
time,
you know,

1601
01:10:30,310 --> 01:10:34,780
it's like the better you make it taste,
the less there is of it kind of thing.

1602
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:39,610
And so a farmer is always trying to make
that balancing act between having this

1603
01:10:39,611 --> 01:10:42,630
far and be more productive versus having
the quality

1604
01:10:42,730 --> 01:10:45,040
I hire.
What is the ultimate taste expression?

1605
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:49,030
What is the move to get?
Forget about no money involved.

1606
01:10:49,110 --> 01:10:50,650
No,
no financial reward.

1607
01:10:50,830 --> 01:10:53,830
You're only trying to achieve the
greatest taste ever.

1608
01:10:54,090 --> 01:10:55,360
What's,
what's the way to do that?

1609
01:10:56,120 --> 01:11:01,120
Start with a variety of coffee that's
known for being really good tasting.

1610
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:04,540
So there's these different varieties of
coffee that we talked about.

1611
01:11:04,660 --> 01:11:08,440
Some of them tastes really good,
some of them maybe are more disease

1612
01:11:08,441 --> 01:11:10,750
resistant and don't taste as good
because of that.

1613
01:11:11,260 --> 01:11:13,830
So you choose a good,
a good

1614
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:17,490
variety to start with.
The disease resistant coffees don't

1615
01:11:17,491 --> 01:11:21,150
taste as good as the thing.
And what diseases specifically is it

1616
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:24,390
getting there is a disease in and you
may have heard about it in the news.

1617
01:11:24,391 --> 01:11:28,400
It's actually a big deal right now.
It's called coffee rust and it's a

1618
01:11:28,410 --> 01:11:31,260
fungal disease that it makes the coffee
leaves,

1619
01:11:31,830 --> 01:11:36,780
get this powder on them that looked
exactly like rust makes all the leaves

1620
01:11:36,781 --> 01:11:40,230
fall off and the coffee plant.
So is it similar to like,

1621
01:11:40,231 --> 01:11:41,064
what's going on?
Like,

1622
01:11:41,190 --> 01:11:41,970
like,
um,

1623
01:11:41,970 --> 01:11:44,520
what is that disease that was hitting?
Oh no,

1624
01:11:44,521 --> 01:11:46,530
that was the bark beetle.
I was thinking of a bug.

1625
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:48,410
But it's like that in that,
in that,

1626
01:11:48,411 --> 01:11:49,021
uh,
you know,

1627
01:11:49,021 --> 01:11:51,630
these,
these crops can be susceptible,

1628
01:11:51,631 --> 01:11:56,500
particularly if there's a narrow genetic
we were talking about and what,

1629
01:11:56,510 --> 01:11:58,020
what specific?
Where's this coffee?

1630
01:11:58,021 --> 01:11:59,400
Rust,
like what is the,

1631
01:11:59,401 --> 01:12:01,380
uh,
is it all over the world or is.

1632
01:12:01,450 --> 01:12:04,200
Yeah,
it's all over the world except it

1633
01:12:04,201 --> 01:12:07,320
doesn't occur really in,
in Ethiopia.

1634
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:12,120
So there's some sort of natural control
happening in Ethiopia that seems to be

1635
01:12:12,121 --> 01:12:13,560
the motherland,
is that like.

1636
01:12:13,590 --> 01:12:16,860
So if you're a real coffee dork,
you're going all due respect.

1637
01:12:16,970 --> 01:12:17,250
Yeah.
Yeah.

1638
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:18,420
I mean that in a good way.
I get it,

1639
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:22,590
if you're a real coffee connoisseur,
Ethiopia is the spot.

1640
01:12:22,710 --> 01:12:23,880
That's where you want to get your
coffee.

1641
01:12:23,881 --> 01:12:27,720
This for the strongest flavors,
the widest variety of flavor and because

1642
01:12:27,721 --> 01:12:28,440
it's the,
oh gee,

1643
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:29,670
I think so.
You know,

1644
01:12:29,790 --> 01:12:33,900
but then you know,
not to qualify that too much.

1645
01:12:33,901 --> 01:12:37,050
I mean there's amazing coffees from
central America.

1646
01:12:37,051 --> 01:12:41,520
Colombia has some of the most incredible
coffees and they're very different.

1647
01:12:41,521 --> 01:12:42,710
Crazy diversity.
Yeah.

1648
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:43,620
In Hawaii,
like I said,

1649
01:12:43,621 --> 01:12:47,520
I really enjoy a coffee from Hawaii.
It just seems to me to have a very

1650
01:12:47,521 --> 01:12:49,200
different taste as well.

1651
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:53,910
What causes that?
Is it the volcanic ground and be a.

1652
01:12:54,180 --> 01:12:57,000
And then coffee's within Hawaii too can
taste very different.

1653
01:12:57,210 --> 01:12:58,410
There's a,
there's a,

1654
01:12:58,411 --> 01:13:00,840
uh,
this is a maui coffee and I usually like

1655
01:13:00,841 --> 01:13:02,110
to kona coffees.
Yeah.

1656
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:05,790
Kona is the most well known area on the,
it's on the big island,

1657
01:13:05,810 --> 01:13:07,260
you know,
um,

1658
01:13:07,350 --> 01:13:08,970
and then it's got altitude.
you can,

1659
01:13:09,180 --> 01:13:11,580
once you go up that mountain,
that's the biggest challenge in,

1660
01:13:11,581 --> 01:13:12,730
uh,
in Hawaii.

1661
01:13:12,731 --> 01:13:15,930
I used to know some people that managed
the coffee farm in molokai,

1662
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:18,480
which is a smaller island,
not as much altitude.

1663
01:13:18,481 --> 01:13:21,960
The coffee wasn't as good,
so that's interesting.

1664
01:13:21,970 --> 01:13:22,950
Yeah.
There's a place in,

1665
01:13:23,110 --> 01:13:25,920
in,
in Hawaii and on the big island called

1666
01:13:25,921 --> 01:13:27,840
mountain thunder.
Have you ever heard of this thing?

1667
01:13:27,930 --> 01:13:28,830
No.
Great.

1668
01:13:29,190 --> 01:13:31,560
Great coffee from mountain thunder from
the big island,

1669
01:13:31,561 --> 01:13:32,820
the big island.
Really delicious.

1670
01:13:32,850 --> 01:13:33,570
I'll get in there.

1671
01:13:33,570 --> 01:13:34,740
Yeah.
But anyway.

1672
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:38,160
Um,
but in general coffees from islands,

1673
01:13:38,161 --> 01:13:41,970
like a,
like a Hawaii,

1674
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,550
Jamaica,
places like this,

1675
01:13:44,730 --> 01:13:46,680
they've got a kind of a unique
characteristic.

1676
01:13:46,681 --> 01:13:48,720
You mighT like coffee from,
uh,

1677
01:13:49,110 --> 01:13:50,970
from Indonesia,
from papa new Guinea.

1678
01:13:51,330 --> 01:13:53,340
And this stuff has four stars.
yeah.

1679
01:13:53,750 --> 01:13:55,530
Uh,
Indonesia and papa new Guinea.

1680
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:56,670
You know,
I,

1681
01:13:56,710 --> 01:13:59,960
I really enjoy coffee,
but until this conversation I was a

1682
01:13:59,970 --> 01:14:01,040
full.
Yeah.

1683
01:14:01,041 --> 01:14:01,874
Well,
you know,

1684
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:03,330
fool.
I knew nothing.

1685
01:14:03,810 --> 01:14:06,600
I relied on too many unscrupulous people
to fill my head with useless

1686
01:14:06,601 --> 01:14:10,200
information.
This is what we do in coffee people.

1687
01:14:10,201 --> 01:14:12,190
This is what we do.
We get dial in to what people like

1688
01:14:12,530 --> 01:14:13,810
and,
and you know,

1689
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:16,660
show them other options if they want.

1690
01:14:16,820 --> 01:14:19,130
So to continue what I was asking you
before,

1691
01:14:19,131 --> 01:14:22,640
say if someone contacted you from Let's
say somewhere in south America and they

1692
01:14:22,641 --> 01:14:27,641
wanted you to go over there and hey,
we need to fix our flavor profile,

1693
01:14:28,550 --> 01:14:30,760
what would you do besides planting
trees?

1694
01:14:30,830 --> 01:14:33,160
Step one is start tasting the coffee
themselves and,

1695
01:14:33,620 --> 01:14:35,720
and how can you,
how can you change that taste?

1696
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:36,991
Well,
okay.

1697
01:14:36,991 --> 01:14:39,510
So you can either shade the coffee or
not.

1698
01:14:39,570 --> 01:14:40,830
You can,
you can,

1699
01:14:41,250 --> 01:14:43,980
you can.
One easy way that a farmer can change

1700
01:14:43,981 --> 01:14:46,050
the quality of their coffee is how ripe
it gets.

1701
01:14:46,860 --> 01:14:50,520
So as coffee gets riper,
it gets sweeter obviously,

1702
01:14:51,060 --> 01:14:55,410
but you don't want it to be too sweet or
else it'll get like overly sweet.

1703
01:14:55,411 --> 01:14:57,910
And also we'll get this kind of rotten
character.

1704
01:14:57,911 --> 01:15:00,570
So figuring out dialing.
And there was a farmer I worked with in

1705
01:15:00,571 --> 01:15:02,160
El Salvador,
um,

1706
01:15:02,970 --> 01:15:06,990
uh,
who like got super focused on how ripe

1707
01:15:06,991 --> 01:15:10,270
she was going to pick her coffee and she
wind up figuring out this is good.

1708
01:15:10,350 --> 01:15:15,350
This is geeky and amaZing is that if she
let the coffee get half of the coffee

1709
01:15:17,651 --> 01:15:20,490
you get to get ripe to where it was,
the color of blood,

1710
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:22,440
uh,
or I'm sorry,

1711
01:15:22,530 --> 01:15:24,360
of wine,
right?

1712
01:15:24,361 --> 01:15:28,320
Like burgundy color,
and then half of the coffee cherries get

1713
01:15:28,321 --> 01:15:30,000
to where they were.
The color of blood,

1714
01:15:30,150 --> 01:15:32,580
like bright red like this.
Um,

1715
01:15:32,790 --> 01:15:35,310
and blended those together.
It was the perfect flavor.

1716
01:15:35,790 --> 01:15:36,810
wow.
What a dork.

1717
01:15:36,870 --> 01:15:39,000
And she dialed in,
but she's famous.

1718
01:15:39,150 --> 01:15:40,020
They did a,
uh,

1719
01:15:40,050 --> 01:15:41,150
a uh,
uh,

1720
01:15:41,190 --> 01:15:43,170
her name is aida by eight.
They did a,

1721
01:15:43,171 --> 01:15:45,060
uh,
a piece on her in the new yorker a

1722
01:15:45,061 --> 01:15:48,390
couple years ago because she's become
the rockstar of,

1723
01:15:48,540 --> 01:15:49,470
in the coffee world.

1724
01:15:49,580 --> 01:15:51,860
That's so fascinating to me.
Like I said,

1725
01:15:51,861 --> 01:15:54,950
when you sat down,
I love people that are really industry.

1726
01:15:55,370 --> 01:15:57,770
When someone gets really into something
as you are in a coffee,

1727
01:15:57,771 --> 01:16:00,020
it's very infectious.
Like,

1728
01:16:00,021 --> 01:16:02,120
you know,
I want to like start trying all these

1729
01:16:02,121 --> 01:16:04,790
different flavors now,
but I don't want to be hopped up out of

1730
01:16:04,791 --> 01:16:06,570
my fucking mind on caffeine all day.
Well,

1731
01:16:06,580 --> 01:16:07,940
you don't have to drink that much
either.

1732
01:16:07,941 --> 01:16:08,690
I mean,
it's like,

1733
01:16:08,690 --> 01:16:10,650
you know,
I've already drank five cups of this

1734
01:16:12,650 --> 01:16:14,480
space it out a little bit,
but it's really good,

1735
01:16:14,510 --> 01:16:16,130
but if you go to a coffee shop all the
time,

1736
01:16:16,131 --> 01:16:18,410
they can blow your mind with a different
flavor of all times.

1737
01:16:18,980 --> 01:16:22,490
How do you feel about a place like a
chain,

1738
01:16:22,491 --> 01:16:24,320
like a big chain?
We don't even have to mention any names,

1739
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:29,390
but one of those big chains that cells
sort of generic coffee like does that.

1740
01:16:29,420 --> 01:16:32,210
you're talking about starbucks.
I am talking about starbucks.

1741
01:16:32,300 --> 01:16:35,540
Does that make you sad when you see
these fucking things are popping up all

1742
01:16:35,541 --> 01:16:36,374
over the place now?

1743
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:37,430
Well,
let me tell you a story.

1744
01:16:37,610 --> 01:16:42,170
So I started in coffee in san diego.
I was running a coffee shop in the.

1745
01:16:42,290 --> 01:16:43,730
I started in [inaudible] 87.
Right.

1746
01:16:43,731 --> 01:16:48,500
So I was a barista in the early nineties
and stuff and in 1994 we're running this

1747
01:16:48,501 --> 01:16:52,310
coffee shop in san diego and we got word
that starbucks was going to start

1748
01:16:52,311 --> 01:16:55,430
opening stores in san diego and
everybody freaked out like,

1749
01:16:55,580 --> 01:16:56,690
oh my god,
we're done.

1750
01:16:56,691 --> 01:16:57,830
We might as well,
you know,

1751
01:16:57,831 --> 01:16:59,210
they're going to.
They're going to drive us into the

1752
01:16:59,211 --> 01:17:01,790
ground that the year that starbucks
showed up,

1753
01:17:03,170 --> 01:17:08,170
um,
was the busiest year that we had and

1754
01:17:08,271 --> 01:17:11,120
every year after that got busier and the
great.

1755
01:17:11,121 --> 01:17:13,820
So the great thing that starbucks has
done and starbucks is,

1756
01:17:14,060 --> 01:17:14,650
you know,
they,

1757
01:17:14,650 --> 01:17:17,120
they started in the seventies in
seattle,

1758
01:17:17,121 --> 01:17:19,240
a bunch of guys that really liked coffee
and they just,

1759
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:21,530
they just figured out how to grow this
business.

1760
01:17:22,070 --> 01:17:23,330
Um,
uh,

1761
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:28,550
they taught in many ways.
They taught the world how to drink

1762
01:17:28,551 --> 01:17:29,040
coffee.

1763
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:31,500
They taught the world to drink coffee in
many ways.

1764
01:17:31,890 --> 01:17:34,140
When I was a kid,
we used to drink coffee in the morning,

1765
01:17:34,141 --> 01:17:36,250
like before I would go to work or you
know,

1766
01:17:36,260 --> 01:17:39,000
like um,
guys would go to dunkin donuts and I was

1767
01:17:39,001 --> 01:17:41,760
working on construction job sites.
Guys are good at dunkin donuts or bring

1768
01:17:41,761 --> 01:17:43,030
back coffees for everybody.
Yeah.

1769
01:17:43,410 --> 01:17:46,680
But there was no,
like going to a coffee shop and buying a

1770
01:17:46,681 --> 01:17:51,660
coffee in the middle of the day.
That Sort of starbucks shifted people's

1771
01:17:52,070 --> 01:17:55,420
mentality,
shifted their behavior to shit.

1772
01:17:55,830 --> 01:17:57,330
Like brian,
like he's,

1773
01:17:57,331 --> 01:17:58,380
oh,
the guy was here earlier.

1774
01:17:58,381 --> 01:18:01,740
It was always gotta fucking venti coffee
in his hand where he goes,

1775
01:18:01,741 --> 01:18:02,574
he's got to starbucks.

1776
01:18:02,660 --> 01:18:04,710
That's right.
And so and so,

1777
01:18:04,711 --> 01:18:06,080
and that's important,
you know,

1778
01:18:06,300 --> 01:18:07,350
so,
uh,

1779
01:18:07,410 --> 01:18:08,243
they've,
you know,

1780
01:18:08,340 --> 01:18:11,690
they've grown and gotten very ubiquitous
and stuff.

1781
01:18:11,700 --> 01:18:14,610
They've got shops all over the place,
but it's not that delicious.

1782
01:18:15,490 --> 01:18:17,550
It's not the best stuff.
It's,

1783
01:18:18,180 --> 01:18:19,013
well,
I mean,

1784
01:18:19,420 --> 01:18:20,700
you know,
I know you're trying to be nice.

1785
01:18:20,740 --> 01:18:23,460
I don't want to accuse anybody of
anything but okay,

1786
01:18:23,461 --> 01:18:24,840
let me put it this way in a very nice
way.

1787
01:18:25,350 --> 01:18:27,210
Instead of saying something negative
about them,

1788
01:18:27,270 --> 01:18:28,740
which I use all the time.
By the way,

1789
01:18:28,741 --> 01:18:30,080
I'm not going to starbucks hater.
I,

1790
01:18:30,300 --> 01:18:32,250
I buy starbucks all the time.
I have no problem with it.

1791
01:18:32,610 --> 01:18:37,610
And um,
if you were going to look for a very

1792
01:18:37,771 --> 01:18:41,250
specific,
very gourmet type of coffee,

1793
01:18:41,251 --> 01:18:42,090
that's not where you would go.

1794
01:18:43,340 --> 01:18:47,360
I'm not a bad cup of coffee,
not a bad cup of coffee.

1795
01:18:47,361 --> 01:18:50,600
But if you want to go really,
you want to have some of this stuff and

1796
01:18:50,601 --> 01:18:52,880
have it this way,
I wouldn't go to a starbucks store

1797
01:18:52,881 --> 01:18:54,980
because that's not what they're doing.
They're bringing coffee to the people,

1798
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:57,710
they're bringing back up pike's peak and
maybe a dark roast.

1799
01:18:57,711 --> 01:19:00,050
And that's it.
And I will say though that I've tasted,

1800
01:19:00,410 --> 01:19:02,880
I've been to starbucks where they blow,
you know,

1801
01:19:03,510 --> 01:19:07,280
whether they've got access to awesome
coffees and they do have that.

1802
01:19:07,410 --> 01:19:09,680
They do do that.
It's not in every store,

1803
01:19:09,681 --> 01:19:10,480
kind of.
Right,

1804
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:11,200
right.
You know,

1805
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:13,110
we'll have the clovers now.
Uh,

1806
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:14,210
yeah.
They've got the clovers,

1807
01:19:14,211 --> 01:19:16,220
they never seen one In a starbucks.
Yeah.

1808
01:19:16,221 --> 01:19:19,370
They've got them in special stores in
and uh,

1809
01:19:19,371 --> 01:19:20,840
and that's another thing that they're
doing.

1810
01:19:20,841 --> 01:19:21,830
They're starting to,
uh,

1811
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,090
you may have seen it in the news.

1812
01:19:23,090 --> 01:19:26,030
They're designing different stores that
do different things and,

1813
01:19:26,150 --> 01:19:27,170
and they're,
they're,

1814
01:19:27,340 --> 01:19:28,173
you know,
they're,

1815
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:31,250
they're,
they're a specialty coffee company

1816
01:19:31,251 --> 01:19:35,690
that's doing their thing and they do
have a wide variety when you bought

1817
01:19:35,710 --> 01:19:36,640
bags.
Yeah.

1818
01:19:36,890 --> 01:19:39,530
Got,
like limited small lot stuff that they

1819
01:19:39,531 --> 01:19:41,750
do.
And how should you store coffee?

1820
01:19:41,900 --> 01:19:44,360
We put it in the freezers that bad.
Uh,

1821
01:19:44,361 --> 01:19:46,180
it depends.
Uh,

1822
01:19:46,190 --> 01:19:47,750
it can be bad,
it can be bad,

1823
01:19:47,780 --> 01:19:50,300
it can be bad if your freezer stinks and
you don't,

1824
01:19:50,490 --> 01:19:52,400
you know,
you don't seal the bag up well enough.

1825
01:19:52,460 --> 01:19:54,050
No,
we don't have a stinky freezers then

1826
01:19:54,051 --> 01:19:55,610
you're good.
we don't ever put anything in there.

1827
01:19:55,611 --> 01:19:56,600
But coffee.
Yeah.

1828
01:19:56,840 --> 01:19:58,910
One.
And the other problem is like right now

1829
01:19:58,911 --> 01:20:02,420
we took the,
we took the coffee out and it got him to

1830
01:20:02,421 --> 01:20:05,930
room temperature and you take it like if
you take a coffee mug that's in the

1831
01:20:05,931 --> 01:20:07,280
freezer out,
you put it in your thing,

1832
01:20:07,290 --> 01:20:08,010
it gets All wet on the

1833
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:08,843
outside.
Right.

1834
01:20:08,940 --> 01:20:10,860
Then you've got that problem,
you know,

1835
01:20:11,670 --> 01:20:15,720
in general we don't tell people.
We generally encourage people not to put

1836
01:20:15,721 --> 01:20:17,730
it in the freezer just and just drink it
fast.

1837
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:20,880
Okay.
So I will say that if I was on,

1838
01:20:20,910 --> 01:20:22,410
if I was in Alaska or something,
you know,

1839
01:20:22,411 --> 01:20:25,140
and I could only get a shipment of
coffee once every six months,

1840
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:26,730
I would freeze it.
Oh,

1841
01:20:26,731 --> 01:20:27,564
okay.
But,

1842
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:29,490
but ideal,
I don't.

1843
01:20:29,530 --> 01:20:29,971
Okay.
Yeah,

1844
01:20:29,971 --> 01:20:31,800
it's not ideal.
So you should essentially,

1845
01:20:31,801 --> 01:20:33,990
I'm sorry to interrupt you,
but you should essentially do it almost

1846
01:20:33,991 --> 01:20:35,360
like you buy vegetables so you
shouldn't.

1847
01:20:35,370 --> 01:20:38,610
exactly.
I always say like you buy bread so you

1848
01:20:38,611 --> 01:20:43,110
should get it and between the time that
it's dried and between the time that

1849
01:20:43,111 --> 01:20:46,200
it's roasted and then you drink it,
how much time should it take place

1850
01:20:46,350 --> 01:20:48,690
between the time it's roasted and the
time you drink it?

1851
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:50,820
So the dry,
it's essentially,

1852
01:20:50,821 --> 01:20:52,250
it's good for how long.
Once it's drawn,

1853
01:20:52,350 --> 01:20:54,810
once it's dried and in Nicaragua or
whatever,

1854
01:20:55,260 --> 01:20:58,560
then it's usually good for about a year,
a year.

1855
01:20:59,310 --> 01:21:02,010
And that's good because it's about once
a year,

1856
01:21:02,011 --> 01:21:02,850
you know,
coffee,

1857
01:21:03,540 --> 01:21:06,330
coffee harvest happens once a year.
They dry it all,

1858
01:21:06,331 --> 01:21:09,930
they get it together,
they stabilize it by drying and then

1859
01:21:09,931 --> 01:21:12,110
they ship it to roasters in the us.
Okay.

1860
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:16,890
So assuming you're in the correct window
then once you get it to a roaster,

1861
01:21:17,220 --> 01:21:18,990
uh,
how long after it's roasted,

1862
01:21:19,020 --> 01:21:22,470
should you drink it and does it matter
or should you brew it and does it matter

1863
01:21:22,471 --> 01:21:23,490
how it's stored?
Then?

1864
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:26,370
Usually the window after roasting is
about two weeks,

1865
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:27,330
two weeks only.
Yeah,

1866
01:21:27,390 --> 01:21:28,051
that's it.
Yeah.

1867
01:21:28,051 --> 01:21:29,970
Like bread.
Wow.

1868
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,290
You know,
that's crazy.

1869
01:21:31,291 --> 01:21:33,480
And,
and really should roast to order.

1870
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:34,371
Yeah.
And,

1871
01:21:34,371 --> 01:21:35,850
and so that's why,
you know,

1872
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:39,600
a good that's interested in coffee
roasting company.

1873
01:21:39,620 --> 01:21:41,400
We have some old coffee.
We should just throw it away.

1874
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:42,540
Yeah,
there's no point.

1875
01:21:42,940 --> 01:21:46,110
Just get some new coffee.
But I'm like this one,

1876
01:21:46,111 --> 01:21:48,000
it says,
it says when it was roasted.

1877
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:48,930
Yeah,
right there.

1878
01:21:49,630 --> 01:21:51,240
Yeah.
So that's a,

1879
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:54,080
that's a uh,
that's a good sign when a,

1880
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:57,540
when a roaster cares enough to like put
the roasting date on there.

1881
01:21:57,600 --> 01:21:59,400
This shit was roasted just a couple of
days ago.

1882
01:21:59,401 --> 01:22:00,660
Yeah,
that's how you do it.

1883
01:22:00,661 --> 01:22:03,240
Huh?
And this is from wrecking ball wrecking

1884
01:22:03,241 --> 01:22:05,190
ball.
Whereas this company in san francisco,

1885
01:22:05,670 --> 01:22:06,960
san francisco is awesome.
Yeah,

1886
01:22:06,961 --> 01:22:08,400
of course they would have something like
this there.

1887
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:09,600
Yeah.
And the uh,

1888
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:12,440
the uh,
it's kind of a cool company to that.

1889
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:15,480
The,
a couple owns this company,

1890
01:22:15,481 --> 01:22:17,400
she's like a kind of a legendary
roaster.

1891
01:22:17,401 --> 01:22:20,430
She's been in coffee for a long time and
uh,

1892
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:25,520
and he is like a pretty famous barista
guy and they got together and they've

1893
01:22:26,191 --> 01:22:27,840
got kind of the,
the,

1894
01:22:27,841 --> 01:22:29,400
they're kind of a power couple in
coffee.

1895
01:22:29,460 --> 01:22:30,780
That sounds amazing.
Yeah.

1896
01:22:30,781 --> 01:22:32,150
They're breaking ball coffee.
All right.

1897
01:22:32,151 --> 01:22:34,330
I'm going to buy some of this.
You can buy it online.

1898
01:22:35,310 --> 01:22:38,170
And so when you buy it online,
do they roast it when you order it?

1899
01:22:38,180 --> 01:22:40,920
Yeah,
a good coffee coffee company will do

1900
01:22:40,921 --> 01:22:42,270
that.
They'll sort of collect the orders and

1901
01:22:42,271 --> 01:22:45,180
then and then do a roasting day and send
it out all out.

1902
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:48,510
I have time she'd get it the day after
it was my friend has a coffee company

1903
01:22:48,511 --> 01:22:53,220
called caveman coffee and when you order
it from caveman coffee.com or whatever

1904
01:22:53,221 --> 01:22:54,120
the fuck it is,
they,

1905
01:22:54,210 --> 01:22:57,150
they roast it as you or that's cool.
That's the only way to do it.

1906
01:22:57,151 --> 01:22:57,900
Right.
Very cool.

1907
01:22:57,900 --> 01:23:00,570
And they should probably start including
roasted on dance.

1908
01:23:00,571 --> 01:23:02,010
Huh?
They don't have roasted on dates,

1909
01:23:02,011 --> 01:23:03,330
but that shit sounds like it's
important.

1910
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:04,320
Sure.
well,

1911
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:06,130
I mean if you're the bag or something,

1912
01:23:06,140 --> 01:23:11,140
I was making a decision about what
coffee to bring you today that made a

1913
01:23:11,261 --> 01:23:12,220
difference.
Dude,

1914
01:23:12,221 --> 01:23:16,780
you knocked it out of the park because
this is a unique flavor and it's,

1915
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:19,900
it's different.
It's unique and weird.

1916
01:23:19,901 --> 01:23:21,460
Uh,
unexpected way.

1917
01:23:21,490 --> 01:23:22,420
You know,
I really,

1918
01:23:22,421 --> 01:23:24,370
really like it.
I love the smell of it too,

1919
01:23:24,371 --> 01:23:25,940
man.
What are the beans smell like?

1920
01:23:25,950 --> 01:23:28,630
Did they have a unique smell?
So you should get a little bit of a

1921
01:23:28,631 --> 01:23:29,800
whiff of that,
of that,

1922
01:23:29,850 --> 01:23:33,260
a low of that lemonade,
jasmine kind of thing.

1923
01:23:33,430 --> 01:23:34,990
Why don't they make sense out of this
shit?

1924
01:23:35,080 --> 01:23:35,860
I know,
right?

1925
01:23:35,860 --> 01:23:37,330
Smell so good.
You know,

1926
01:23:37,331 --> 01:23:38,800
I used to,
one time I had to,

1927
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:42,610
I had to work with an airline to try to
get their coffee tasting better up

1928
01:23:42,611 --> 01:23:43,360
there.
They.

1929
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:45,000
And how did you do that?
And you go,

1930
01:23:45,050 --> 01:23:47,140
I didn't.
It wasn't that successful in this.

1931
01:23:47,170 --> 01:23:49,480
In this particular case,
it wasn't that successful,

1932
01:23:49,481 --> 01:23:52,840
but with all the flight attendants were
doing is they were taking the coffee

1933
01:23:53,410 --> 01:23:56,320
bags and they're putting it in the
bathroom to make it smell a little bit

1934
01:23:56,321 --> 01:23:58,030
better in there.
That was the best thing that they couLd

1935
01:23:58,031 --> 01:23:59,140
do with this.
Oh,

1936
01:23:59,141 --> 01:24:01,630
so you just used it as coffee popery
yeah,

1937
01:24:01,631 --> 01:24:03,100
exactLy.
That's interesting.

1938
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:05,080
Well,
that's kind of a good move beCause when

1939
01:24:05,081 --> 01:24:07,270
you smell,
even if it's crap coffee,

1940
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:09,070
you know,
when you smell the grinds,

1941
01:24:09,130 --> 01:24:12,730
it smells good.
You can open up a folgers and get it

1942
01:24:12,731 --> 01:24:13,720
out.
That's folgers is crap,

1943
01:24:13,721 --> 01:24:17,110
but you get that,
that smell of non roasted the coffee.

1944
01:24:17,140 --> 01:24:19,840
It's delicious.
It's like so people,

1945
01:24:19,841 --> 01:24:22,150
human beings like the smell of brown
things,

1946
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:24,480
you know.
Have you noticed at all brown things?

1947
01:24:25,380 --> 01:24:27,850
Yeah,
but like,

1948
01:24:27,851 --> 01:24:29,050
you know,
toasts.

1949
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:31,170
Yes.
One of the greatest smells ever eat

1950
01:24:31,180 --> 01:24:31,630
steak.

1951
01:24:31,630 --> 01:24:32,270
Yeah.
Yeah,

1952
01:24:32,270 --> 01:24:33,610
that's true.
Good point.

1953
01:24:33,820 --> 01:24:37,420
Bread,
baking all these chocolate.

1954
01:24:37,810 --> 01:24:39,760
We love things that are a little bit
right.

1955
01:24:39,820 --> 01:24:40,870
Yeah.
This brown,

1956
01:24:40,980 --> 01:24:43,930
the column browning reactions in
science,

1957
01:24:43,931 --> 01:24:47,350
you know,
and when he turns food brown,

1958
01:24:47,590 --> 01:24:49,600
it tastes good.
It certainlY does.

1959
01:24:49,720 --> 01:24:53,410
It's fascinating thing.
Like try eating a piece of raw steak.

1960
01:24:53,460 --> 01:24:54,660
Yeah,
it really doesn't have that,

1961
01:24:54,670 --> 01:24:56,200
that great.
The best flavor to it,

1962
01:24:56,201 --> 01:25:00,070
but god damn when it's got that crust on
the outside of it and you cut through it

1963
01:25:00,071 --> 01:25:00,904
and.
Yeah.

1964
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:02,950
Delicious.
Yeah.

1965
01:25:03,010 --> 01:25:08,010
I am a fan of tastes and flavors and I
think it's sort of an unsung art form

1966
01:25:08,051 --> 01:25:11,770
that people have figured out how to
cultivate different tastes and flavors

1967
01:25:11,771 --> 01:25:14,860
and all sorts of foods and I'm in in
cooking.

1968
01:25:14,861 --> 01:25:16,960
I became a big fan of cooking.
I can't.

1969
01:25:16,961 --> 01:25:20,650
I don't really cook very well,
but I became a big fan of the art form

1970
01:25:20,651 --> 01:25:23,290
of cooking very well when I started
watching anthony bourdain's no

1971
01:25:23,291 --> 01:25:27,100
reservations show and then and becoming
friends with him and getting to know him

1972
01:25:27,101 --> 01:25:29,470
and talking to him about chefs and going
to a restaurant with him,

1973
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:32,500
which is what was one of the coolest
fucking experiences of all time is

1974
01:25:32,501 --> 01:25:32,920
amazing.

1975
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:34,010
It's like,
you know,

1976
01:25:34,570 --> 01:25:37,870
playing basketball with Michael Jordan
or soda and you're hanging out at a

1977
01:25:37,871 --> 01:25:39,590
restaurant with anthony bourdain.
Totally.

1978
01:25:40,030 --> 01:25:41,000
But he,
you.

1979
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:44,440
I developed a respect for the art form
from him,

1980
01:25:44,710 --> 01:25:46,990
from watching his show,
the art form of cooking,

1981
01:25:46,991 --> 01:25:50,110
and then I started considering it in a
different light instead of thinking

1982
01:25:50,111 --> 01:25:50,501
like,
oh,

1983
01:25:50,501 --> 01:25:52,390
it's nice when people cook good food.
Oh,

1984
01:25:52,391 --> 01:25:54,730
that tastes good.
I want to eat there instead.

1985
01:25:54,731 --> 01:25:57,330
I started thinking of it as art is
artwork right now.

1986
01:25:57,340 --> 01:26:00,610
No different than a song.
No different than a standup comedy

1987
01:26:00,611 --> 01:26:03,130
sketch or you know,
or a cup of coffee.

1988
01:26:03,170 --> 01:26:03,740
Right?
The,

1989
01:26:03,740 --> 01:26:03,980
the,

1990
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:06,020
the,
the art in the creative,

1991
01:26:06,350 --> 01:26:08,570
the creative.
Literally creative because you're

1992
01:26:08,571 --> 01:26:09,890
creating.
I mean,

1993
01:26:09,891 --> 01:26:11,460
you're growing and you're,
you're,

1994
01:26:11,461 --> 01:26:14,120
you're influencing the actual finished
product.

1995
01:26:14,121 --> 01:26:17,120
Yeah.
It's sort of an overlooked aspect of

1996
01:26:17,121 --> 01:26:17,990
creativity,
isn't it?

1997
01:26:18,030 --> 01:26:18,863
Yeah,
absolutely.

1998
01:26:18,930 --> 01:26:20,030
It totally is.
And,

1999
01:26:20,060 --> 01:26:23,730
and people,
it's nice to hear you talking like that

2000
01:26:23,731 --> 01:26:27,210
because guys in coffee,
if we start to talk about how we think

2001
01:26:27,211 --> 01:26:30,330
of coffee as an art form,
a lot of times people are like,

2002
01:26:30,331 --> 01:26:31,141
ah,
come on,

2003
01:26:31,141 --> 01:26:31,400
you.

2004
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:33,260
People are always looking to call
bullshit man.

2005
01:26:33,680 --> 01:26:35,330
People call bullshit too much.
It's true.

2006
01:26:35,390 --> 01:26:38,300
It's good thing to call bullshit because
there's a lot of bullshit out there,

2007
01:26:38,540 --> 01:26:41,540
but it's not a good thing to call
bullshit about people's passions.

2008
01:26:41,541 --> 01:26:45,140
I think it's more interesting to observe
those passions and try to find out what

2009
01:26:45,141 --> 01:26:48,980
it is and if I looked at it on a surface
level and I wasn't really into flavors

2010
01:26:48,981 --> 01:26:52,910
and I didn't have that sort of
transition in the way I thought about

2011
01:26:52,911 --> 01:26:56,210
flavors because of cooking,
I probably wouldn't think about it that

2012
01:26:56,211 --> 01:26:59,480
much either.
But when I sit down and talk to a guy

2013
01:26:59,481 --> 01:27:03,530
like you who obviously is dedicated,
incredible amount of time to this

2014
01:27:03,531 --> 01:27:05,720
passion,
then that's when it becomes infectious.

2015
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:06,800
You kind of understand it.

2016
01:27:06,870 --> 01:27:07,703
Yeah,
it's true.

2017
01:27:07,740 --> 01:27:08,630
So,
um,

2018
01:27:08,730 --> 01:27:10,340
and that's the way I,
you know,

2019
01:27:10,350 --> 01:27:12,300
I,
and a lot of my colleagues think about

2020
01:27:12,301 --> 01:27:15,270
it is,
is like how can we make the flavor just

2021
01:27:15,271 --> 01:27:19,590
kind of stopped people in their tracks?
How can we use coffee and like.

2022
01:27:19,650 --> 01:27:22,530
So like for me,
I kind of mentioned this before,

2023
01:27:22,980 --> 01:27:24,870
when you're in,
when you're a coffee person,

2024
01:27:24,871 --> 01:27:28,510
when you're a barista,
you're interacting with people at like

2025
01:27:28,530 --> 01:27:30,840
this really delicate point in their day,
you know,

2026
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:33,420
they don't know what's going on.
They're coming to your coffee bar.

2027
01:27:34,050 --> 01:27:36,930
They,
you're usually the first person they've

2028
01:27:36,931 --> 01:27:40,770
seen other than their wife or whatever
and uh,

2029
01:27:41,130 --> 01:27:42,750
and they're,
they're not sure what kind of day

2030
01:27:42,751 --> 01:27:44,550
they're having.
And then if you give them something

2031
01:27:44,551 --> 01:27:46,740
that's sort of like,
tastes really good,

2032
01:27:46,770 --> 01:27:50,550
it makes them feel good.
It's like a great thing and if you.

2033
01:27:50,551 --> 01:27:53,880
And if you do that for people a lot,
you know,

2034
01:27:53,881 --> 01:27:56,160
you feel like you're doing something
positive for the world.

2035
01:27:56,190 --> 01:27:58,440
So I always get really focused on these
things.

2036
01:27:58,870 --> 01:27:59,410
Sure.
I mean,

2037
01:27:59,410 --> 01:28:00,870
you certainly do,
you know what I mean?

2038
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:04,270
I think that anytime you can inspire
someone to,

2039
01:28:04,570 --> 01:28:06,730
you know,
you can inspire someone with your

2040
01:28:06,731 --> 01:28:10,510
passion for something I'm in.
I'm constantly inspired by things that I

2041
01:28:10,511 --> 01:28:12,790
don't want to have anything to do with.
You know,

2042
01:28:12,791 --> 01:28:16,600
like there's people that inspire me.
Like I watched that movie,

2043
01:28:16,900 --> 01:28:20,620
jiro dreams of sushi.
I don't want to make sushi or you know,

2044
01:28:20,621 --> 01:28:23,230
I really don't want to eat a.
I certainly do.

2045
01:28:23,290 --> 01:28:27,220
I was thinking literally thinking about
flying to Japan.

2046
01:28:27,270 --> 01:28:28,720
Yeah,
and booking a reservation.

2047
01:28:28,721 --> 01:28:31,960
I was going to try to see if I really
should call David Lee roth who lives in

2048
01:28:31,961 --> 01:28:34,570
Japan and in Japan.
Fuck jay.

2049
01:28:34,571 --> 01:28:38,350
Does David Lee roth lives in Japan and
practice sword fighting all day.

2050
01:28:39,010 --> 01:28:41,890
David lee ross,
one of the greatest bad motherfuckers to

2051
01:28:41,891 --> 01:28:45,250
ever walk the face of the planet.
Guy walks around and overhauls gives

2052
01:28:45,251 --> 01:28:46,120
zero fucks.

2053
01:28:46,300 --> 01:28:51,300
He's in his sixties and still doing new
things and challenging himself.

2054
01:28:53,710 --> 01:28:57,190
He lives in fucking Japan in tokyo with
his dog.

2055
01:28:57,550 --> 01:29:01,120
He has an apartment that's fucking David
Lee roth man.

2056
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:05,310
He's a David Lee roth and he's got an
apartment like a normal person with a

2057
01:29:05,311 --> 01:29:07,560
dog in tokyo.
He's.

2058
01:29:07,590 --> 01:29:08,760
He's incredible.
Well,

2059
01:29:08,761 --> 01:29:10,380
if you do that,
if you go to Japan to.

2060
01:29:10,510 --> 01:29:13,980
There he is.
He's such a cool guy.

2061
01:29:13,981 --> 01:29:15,870
We allowed him to wear sunglasses
indoors.

2062
01:29:16,020 --> 01:29:17,820
I didn't shit on him while we were
taking that photo.

2063
01:29:18,120 --> 01:29:20,600
That's an old school thing.
I thought those,

2064
01:29:20,630 --> 01:29:23,970
those old school rock stars,
they still wear sunglasses indoors and

2065
01:29:23,971 --> 01:29:24,840
we let them get away with it.

2066
01:29:25,140 --> 01:29:27,490
Um,
but if you do that,

2067
01:29:27,491 --> 01:29:30,160
if you go visit jiro,
let me know and I'll,

2068
01:29:30,280 --> 01:29:33,370
I'll send you some coffee places that
are sort of the equivalent of that.

2069
01:29:33,460 --> 01:29:34,630
Ah,
in Japan,

2070
01:29:34,631 --> 01:29:35,710
Japan.
Really.

2071
01:29:35,711 --> 01:29:39,820
So these coffee guys.
So in many ways Japan,

2072
01:29:40,970 --> 01:29:45,490
there's a concept in japanese called
coda and that is like practice,

2073
01:29:45,550 --> 01:29:47,620
practice,
practice until you're the best in the

2074
01:29:47,621 --> 01:29:50,590
world and keep practicing and keep
getting it wrong,

2075
01:29:50,591 --> 01:29:52,060
but you're going to get better all the
time.

2076
01:29:52,360 --> 01:29:53,193
You know,
and it's,

2077
01:29:53,370 --> 01:29:56,620
it's evident in martial arts,
it's evident in jiro dreams of sushi.

2078
01:29:56,650 --> 01:29:57,710
Right?
And so he's like,

2079
01:29:57,730 --> 01:29:58,410
focus

2080
01:29:58,410 --> 01:30:00,840
was what they were calling each other.
Was that the phrase?

2081
01:30:00,841 --> 01:30:02,100
This phrase?
Yeah.

2082
01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:03,730
Yeah.
And uh,

2083
01:30:03,970 --> 01:30:08,020
and this exists for coffee to this,
this idea of getting it perfect.

2084
01:30:08,860 --> 01:30:10,990
There's this one coffee Place I went to
last time.

2085
01:30:10,991 --> 01:30:13,360
I was in Japan that would blow your
mind.

2086
01:30:13,390 --> 01:30:16,750
It's this guy that's like super.
He has this coffee equipment.

2087
01:30:17,380 --> 01:30:19,480
I walked in,
my wife,

2088
01:30:19,890 --> 01:30:22,870
uh,
she actually found out about this place

2089
01:30:22,871 --> 01:30:27,040
from a japanese friend of hers.
We walk into this place and he's got all

2090
01:30:27,041 --> 01:30:30,780
this crazy equipment like,
like you'd like it.

2091
01:30:30,790 --> 01:30:34,690
It's like,
it's like weird weirdly excessive coffee

2092
01:30:34,691 --> 01:30:36,400
equipment.
I'm saying what is going on?

2093
01:30:36,490 --> 01:30:39,670
And also in this place,
this guy has stereo equipment,

2094
01:30:39,700 --> 01:30:43,480
these giant speakers playing,
uh,

2095
01:30:43,540 --> 01:30:48,280
playing like perfect the and the
incredible turntable and all this stuff

2096
01:30:48,490 --> 01:30:51,550
playing like perfect classical music and
he's serving.

2097
01:30:51,700 --> 01:30:56,350
His goal is to serve you the perfect
coffee while you're listening to the

2098
01:30:56,351 --> 01:31:01,351
perfect music and it's like a crazy
library and this guy takes five minutes

2099
01:31:01,541 --> 01:31:02,530
to make you a cup of coffee.

2100
01:31:02,890 --> 01:31:04,410
Whoa.
Um,

2101
01:31:04,540 --> 01:31:06,070
but along it,
well,

2102
01:31:06,071 --> 01:31:07,960
he's just like practice.
He's getting it right.

2103
01:31:07,961 --> 01:31:08,470
You know,
he's,

2104
01:31:08,470 --> 01:31:10,930
he's nailing it.
He'll throw stuff away if it's not

2105
01:31:10,931 --> 01:31:13,020
perfect.
And how will we know if it's perfect?

2106
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:14,110
Well,
it's like judo man.

2107
01:31:14,111 --> 01:31:18,700
It's like he's just trying to get to the
ultimate coffee experience.

2108
01:31:18,730 --> 01:31:23,140
There's another guy named katsu.
He's got a place called bear pond

2109
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:28,200
espresso and he learned about coffee in
New York and so he's trying to bring the

2110
01:31:28,301 --> 01:31:32,410
New York city coffee experience to,
to central tokyo,

2111
01:31:32,510 --> 01:31:34,000
you know,
and he's got this little place.

2112
01:31:34,001 --> 01:31:34,540
He,
he,

2113
01:31:34,540 --> 01:31:36,870
this guy,
he,

2114
01:31:37,090 --> 01:31:40,150
he shows up to his shop like an hour and
a half before they open these spins,

2115
01:31:40,151 --> 01:31:43,260
that hour and a half,
making his coffee taste right and taste

2116
01:31:43,270 --> 01:31:44,590
it,
throw it away,

2117
01:31:44,990 --> 01:31:46,460
adjust.
Tasted again.

2118
01:31:46,580 --> 01:31:47,890
You know.
And if it's not right,

2119
01:31:47,891 --> 01:31:49,240
he doesn't open.
There is.

2120
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:50,560
Yeah.
That's,

2121
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:51,910
that's,
that's katsu man.

2122
01:31:51,970 --> 01:31:54,220
God damn.
That place is awesome.

2123
01:31:54,250 --> 01:31:56,650
And that's in tokyo.
That guy is a bad ass.

2124
01:31:56,890 --> 01:31:58,950
He sounds like a,
he is a coffee bad ass.

2125
01:31:59,490 --> 01:31:59,980
And him and

2126
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:01,330
his wife,
that's all,

2127
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:06,440
you know as a tiny little place you go
in there if it's not open it's because

2128
01:32:07,571 --> 01:32:09,600
he's trying to get the coffee right.
and uh,

2129
01:32:09,700 --> 01:32:13,030
you just wait and then you go in there
and he makes you awesome coffee.

2130
01:32:13,031 --> 01:32:14,140
Did you go there?
Oh yeah.

2131
01:32:14,141 --> 01:32:15,880
You fly there just to drink off?
No,

2132
01:32:15,881 --> 01:32:18,010
but I was there for it,
but I definitely made it make a trip.

2133
01:32:18,040 --> 01:32:20,500
Every time I'm in tokyo I go to visit
katsu.

2134
01:32:20,501 --> 01:32:22,570
He's the man,
so he rides around on a motorcycle and

2135
01:32:23,080 --> 01:32:24,620
I'd never seen that before.
Oh yeah.

2136
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:26,980
That's his place.
It just jumped off a motorcycle.

2137
01:32:27,010 --> 01:32:28,210
Yeah.
Yeah.

2138
01:32:28,211 --> 01:32:31,970
He's a bad ass now.
Are they places like that here and you

2139
01:32:32,040 --> 01:32:35,230
find that on vimeo there's a whole,
like three minute documentary about.

2140
01:32:35,231 --> 01:32:36,064
Oh yeah.

2141
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:38,850
Say the name of the documentary so folks
could watch it if they want to.

2142
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,250
Uh,
I think it's just bare pond espresso.

2143
01:32:41,460 --> 01:32:45,900
Bear upon his press.
What other spots like that in los

2144
01:32:45,901 --> 01:32:48,720
angeles or they're really,
really exceptionally good coffee spots.

2145
01:32:48,830 --> 01:32:51,050
Yeah.
So the place I actually bought that for

2146
01:32:51,051 --> 01:32:55,830
you here locally in a,
in a shop in culver city called kronos,

2147
01:32:55,860 --> 01:33:00,860
anti c o g n o s c e n t I cognizant.
Yeah.

2148
01:33:01,910 --> 01:33:02,790
Yeah.
Cognitive study.

2149
01:33:02,791 --> 01:33:04,490
Which means those in the know.
There you go.

2150
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:05,900
Yeah.
There's a queue.

2151
01:33:05,990 --> 01:33:08,120
That's a pool cue.
I play pool.

2152
01:33:08,580 --> 01:33:11,330
There's a pool cue called the cognizant
and by my friend joe gold.

2153
01:33:11,810 --> 01:33:14,700
He designed this show gold.
Well,

2154
01:33:14,930 --> 01:33:15,980
it's a very common name.
Yeah,

2155
01:33:15,990 --> 01:33:18,080
but he's a.
He lives in chicago.

2156
01:33:18,120 --> 01:33:20,420
Okay.
One of the best pool cue manufacturers

2157
01:33:20,540 --> 01:33:23,270
are artists I should say in the world.
Cool.

2158
01:33:23,370 --> 01:33:24,560
Yeah,
and the cognitive one.

2159
01:33:24,680 --> 01:33:27,920
Yeah,
and he had them designed based on.

2160
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:33,520
He hired these engineers to figure out
what was the exact perfect taper and the

2161
01:33:34,431 --> 01:33:37,160
right combinations of woods,
like mostly uses ebony.

2162
01:33:37,161 --> 01:33:40,370
He used all kinds of different Woods,
but most of the time he uses ebony with

2163
01:33:40,371 --> 01:33:45,371
a maple shaft and certain woolman dried
aged wood because the wood has to be

2164
01:33:45,621 --> 01:33:47,650
dry.
They can camp any water in the water,

2165
01:33:47,651 --> 01:33:49,580
a little move as it dries and it
changes,

2166
01:33:49,581 --> 01:33:51,280
so they have to cut the wood down.

2167
01:33:51,300 --> 01:33:54,740
He starts out in a big block and you
slowly cut it down over long periods of

2168
01:33:54,741 --> 01:33:58,040
time until it becomes a doll.
He could make a qwiff because you have

2169
01:33:58,041 --> 01:33:59,990
to allow for the wood to move as it
dries.

2170
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,430
Second guitar maker.
It's very,

2171
01:34:01,431 --> 01:34:04,490
very similar and there's.
There's a big difference amongst pool

2172
01:34:04,491 --> 01:34:07,610
players in woods and how they perform on
a table.

2173
01:34:07,611 --> 01:34:09,560
If they have a different,
like a maple,

2174
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:14,280
a forearm of the queue.
There's a joint in most cues and then

2175
01:34:14,290 --> 01:34:17,660
the shaft is almost always maple.
The maple forum will be very Different

2176
01:34:17,661 --> 01:34:21,920
than a coco bolo for like a springiness.
Yes,

2177
01:34:21,950 --> 01:34:23,660
yes.
There's maple is a little bit more

2178
01:34:23,661 --> 01:34:27,120
gentle and forgiving and a cocoa elbows
a little more dense than ebony is

2179
01:34:27,130 --> 01:34:30,170
denser.
Still having also is heavier so it has

2180
01:34:30,171 --> 01:34:33,200
like a more forward balance to it.
The middle of the queue will hold a lot

2181
01:34:33,201 --> 01:34:35,660
of weight,
so sometimes people who prefer a maple

2182
01:34:35,661 --> 01:34:37,160
queue,
we'll go with the steel joint.

2183
01:34:37,190 --> 01:34:40,550
So the steel in the middle sort of
access like a pendulum because the

2184
01:34:40,551 --> 01:34:44,300
weight is forward on the queue.
Like the balance of the cubes is very

2185
01:34:44,301 --> 01:34:46,700
important,
but it's also an artist in thing.

2186
01:34:46,730 --> 01:34:49,940
It's like it's just like this coffee
thing and a lot of ways is the people

2187
01:34:49,941 --> 01:34:52,460
that are really into it are really into
it and they,

2188
01:34:52,700 --> 01:34:54,650
you know,
the guys who make pool cues,

2189
01:34:54,651 --> 01:34:57,590
like there's they're artists and they're
doing a lot of,

2190
01:34:57,620 --> 01:35:00,770
especially guys like joe gold do it on a
very high end level.

2191
01:35:00,771 --> 01:35:02,300
They're making a functional piece of
art.

2192
01:35:02,301 --> 01:35:04,820
It's very beautiful to look at as well.
Yeah.

2193
01:35:04,821 --> 01:35:08,450
This is joe's work here.
These are like really super fancy ones.

2194
01:35:08,451 --> 01:35:12,710
Were you seeing the end lazy bottom and
these.

2195
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:14,540
I dOn't know whether he's going to have
a wrap on.

2196
01:35:14,541 --> 01:35:17,420
These are what sometimes they make some
with no rap,

2197
01:35:17,450 --> 01:35:21,140
meaning they'll know leather around the
handle and some people prefer leather

2198
01:35:21,141 --> 01:35:23,180
around the handle.
There's a whole art to that too,

2199
01:35:23,181 --> 01:35:23,820
I think.
Yeah,

2200
01:35:23,820 --> 01:35:25,910
I'm unbelievably fascinated by that as
well,

2201
01:35:26,090 --> 01:35:28,520
but like I said,
I'm in anything like a guitar makers.

2202
01:35:28,521 --> 01:35:30,890
I don't play guitar,
but I watched a documentary on how a guy

2203
01:35:30,891 --> 01:35:33,320
makes a guitar.
I think I watched a whole documentary on

2204
01:35:33,510 --> 01:35:38,510
a mongolian bowmaker last night because
making traditional mongolian like

2205
01:35:39,710 --> 01:35:42,590
recurve bows,
you guys doing it at all these different

2206
01:35:42,591 --> 01:35:47,591
woods and using animal horns and seeing
you and It will glue that they make from

2207
01:35:48,280 --> 01:35:51,390
from fish.
I'd so much rather

2208
01:35:51,460 --> 01:35:54,160
pay my money for something that is like
handmade.

2209
01:35:54,190 --> 01:35:56,490
Yeah.
It means that their soul into it.

2210
01:35:56,550 --> 01:35:57,690
Yeah,
it does.

2211
01:35:57,691 --> 01:36:00,450
It means something.
It turns in our normal artifact into

2212
01:36:00,451 --> 01:36:01,840
something really special.
Yeah.

2213
01:36:01,970 --> 01:36:06,510
It's functional and you also get a
feeling from using that thing.

2214
01:36:06,730 --> 01:36:09,360
You know,
whether it is a handmade knife that

2215
01:36:09,361 --> 01:36:11,190
you're chopping up food within your
kitchen.

2216
01:36:11,460 --> 01:36:15,220
You know that somewhere in brooklyn,
the guy you know works in a shop that

2217
01:36:15,660 --> 01:36:20,190
cuts that metal and polishes it down and
sharpens it up and then sends it to you

2218
01:36:20,191 --> 01:36:22,860
and you're,
you're receiving a labor of love.

2219
01:36:22,861 --> 01:36:23,440
You know,
you're.

2220
01:36:23,440 --> 01:36:23,920
Yeah.
You're,

2221
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:26,640
you're receiving the fruits of someone's
creativity.

2222
01:36:26,670 --> 01:36:27,780
There's something about,
yeah,

2223
01:36:27,810 --> 01:36:28,890
handmade,
stuff like that.

2224
01:36:29,190 --> 01:36:31,740
Well,
something about us human beings that we

2225
01:36:31,741 --> 01:36:34,080
really appreciate other people's effort
work.

2226
01:36:34,130 --> 01:36:36,390
That's why you want to have someone's
artwork on your wall.

2227
01:36:36,770 --> 01:36:37,320
You know,
what's,

2228
01:36:37,320 --> 01:36:40,650
why you want to,
a piece of furniture that someone made.

2229
01:36:40,651 --> 01:36:44,610
It's like there's something uniquely
satisfying instead of like something at

2230
01:36:44,611 --> 01:36:49,230
ikea that's just like some form block
thing that's made in a factory and it's

2231
01:36:49,231 --> 01:36:52,320
totally true and spit out.
But if you could buy a couch that Some

2232
01:36:52,321 --> 01:36:55,270
guy actually carve the wood and,
and,

2233
01:36:55,380 --> 01:36:59,580
and planted the or put the cushions in
place and you know,

2234
01:36:59,790 --> 01:37:02,960
embroidered it all and oh my god,
that'd be amazing.

2235
01:37:02,970 --> 01:37:05,820
You get excited about it when you sit in
it and you're sitting in someone's work.

2236
01:37:06,060 --> 01:37:07,470
Totally.
So anyway,

2237
01:37:07,680 --> 01:37:08,513
you guys places

2238
01:37:08,780 --> 01:37:10,380
one,
the chi is,

2239
01:37:10,390 --> 01:37:13,490
he's the guy who was an architect but
got turned on to cough

2240
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:15,510
and this is in culver city is the city.
Yeah.

2241
01:37:15,660 --> 01:37:17,040
So cognizant,
any coffee,

2242
01:37:17,070 --> 01:37:18,150
there you go,
there you go.

2243
01:37:18,300 --> 01:37:19,920
And then another great place and yeah,

2244
01:37:20,030 --> 01:37:21,780
in la that I like a lot,
um,

2245
01:37:22,050 --> 01:37:25,580
is it's called g and b coffee.
these guys,

2246
01:37:25,620 --> 01:37:27,040
uh,
uh,

2247
01:37:27,560 --> 01:37:30,620
charles babinski and kyle glanville got
together.

2248
01:37:30,860 --> 01:37:35,390
Then they're the gnb and uh,
and they put together a coffee program.

2249
01:37:35,420 --> 01:37:38,270
Amazing downtown la.
Their shop is.

2250
01:37:38,330 --> 01:37:39,640
And uh,
um,

2251
01:37:40,280 --> 01:37:45,020
charles is the current reigning.
Okay.

2252
01:37:46,160 --> 01:37:48,380
Do you know we have champions like
barista champion?

2253
01:37:48,990 --> 01:37:51,020
We've met a contest of champions.
Yeah.

2254
01:37:51,021 --> 01:37:51,841
Yeah.
What do they do?

2255
01:37:51,841 --> 01:37:53,650
Like crossfit?
no,

2256
01:37:53,690 --> 01:37:55,110
we,
it's like a coffee.

2257
01:37:55,410 --> 01:37:56,190
Anybody ever breached

2258
01:37:56,190 --> 01:37:59,210
until they died because that.
Has anybody ever breached it to like

2259
01:37:59,211 --> 01:38:01,890
John Henry just like dropped from.
Yeah.

2260
01:38:01,891 --> 01:38:02,520
Well like,
you know,

2261
01:38:02,520 --> 01:38:06,080
they have contests to see if people can
do things for $20 a day.

2262
01:38:06,110 --> 01:38:07,520
I like an endurance thing.
Yeah.

2263
01:38:07,521 --> 01:38:09,240
Have they ever have a barista till you
drop it?

2264
01:38:09,241 --> 01:38:09,780
I know.
No,

2265
01:38:09,780 --> 01:38:12,090
they shouldn't do that now because
people will wind up dying.

2266
01:38:12,091 --> 01:38:13,260
They would die.
People are crazy.

2267
01:38:13,410 --> 01:38:15,990
We need to limit the amount of
competition that people were actually

2268
01:38:15,991 --> 01:38:17,160
allowed to involve.
And that's true.

2269
01:38:17,161 --> 01:38:21,540
So this is the coffee,
the coffee competItions that we do and

2270
01:38:21,541 --> 01:38:22,850
there are,
it's a,

2271
01:38:23,080 --> 01:38:25,940
there's a barista thing where they're
making espresso.

2272
01:38:25,950 --> 01:38:28,830
There's a brewer's thing where there
brewing coffee,

2273
01:38:28,831 --> 01:38:30,690
there's a tasters thing where they,
they're,

2274
01:38:31,140 --> 01:38:34,980
they're competing on how well they can
taste coffee and discern the differences

2275
01:38:35,010 --> 01:38:37,950
between coffee and stuff.
So there is a coffee version of the

2276
01:38:37,951 --> 01:38:38,784
Somalia?

2277
01:38:38,820 --> 01:38:39,600
Yeah,
absolutely.

2278
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:42,100
So you drank this,
you would know this is from Ethiopia if,

2279
01:38:42,240 --> 01:38:44,520
if you didn't,
if you didn't drink this,

2280
01:38:44,550 --> 01:38:48,360
if you drank this and you called
yourself a coffee pro and you weren't

2281
01:38:48,361 --> 01:38:50,430
able to identify it as,
as a chef,

2282
01:38:50,431 --> 01:38:52,290
you,
that would be a major.

2283
01:38:52,810 --> 01:38:53,790
Um,
you'd be a faker.

2284
01:38:53,910 --> 01:38:54,743
Well,
kind of.

2285
01:38:54,930 --> 01:38:57,270
Yeah.
I mean this is one of the classic

2286
01:38:57,271 --> 01:39:00,540
origins of coffee that you need to be
able to identify what could you get

2287
01:39:00,541 --> 01:39:02,760
confused by?
Like if you were really worried,

2288
01:39:02,761 --> 01:39:05,790
like if you had a bet your mortgage on
whether or not you could nail one,

2289
01:39:05,791 --> 01:39:07,410
which would be,
what would be a tricky one?

2290
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:10,620
The differences between what coffee's
still in central America.

2291
01:39:10,621 --> 01:39:15,030
They get really new because I mean think
about that central american isthmus

2292
01:39:15,031 --> 01:39:15,864
there,
you know,

2293
01:39:16,110 --> 01:39:17,670
El Salvador,
Guatemala,

2294
01:39:17,700 --> 01:39:18,990
Costa Rica,
Nicaragua,

2295
01:39:18,991 --> 01:39:21,150
there all right next to each other and
as you said,

2296
01:39:21,450 --> 01:39:22,120
like the same.

2297
01:39:22,120 --> 01:39:23,860
Very similar,
right?

2298
01:39:23,880 --> 01:39:28,880
So those coffees tastes very similar but
like a coffee from another great coffee

2299
01:39:30,001 --> 01:39:35,001
growing area is right in the middle of
Kenya and Kenya is right just south of

2300
01:39:35,821 --> 01:39:37,680
Ethiopia.
But the coffee taste completely

2301
01:39:37,681 --> 01:39:38,760
different,
huh?

2302
01:39:39,290 --> 01:39:40,650
Um,
and uh,

2303
01:39:40,680 --> 01:39:45,480
so there's a city called the okay.
JusT as yoga chef is special in,

2304
01:39:45,570 --> 01:39:47,190
in,
in Ethiopia,

2305
01:39:47,191 --> 01:39:52,191
a place called neery and y e r I n Kenya
is really special and that it,

2306
01:39:54,450 --> 01:39:58,020
it the coffee,
their tastes like a black berries,

2307
01:39:58,610 --> 01:40:00,470
you know,
like this is like lemons there.

2308
01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:02,760
It tastes like black berries or black
currents.

2309
01:40:03,300 --> 01:40:07,110
Really beautiful and savory like meat.
now what would happen if you took that

2310
01:40:07,111 --> 01:40:10,080
stuff though?
like you took some plants from that area

2311
01:40:10,260 --> 01:40:13,200
and then moved them to Hawaii?
That's a great question.

2312
01:40:13,740 --> 01:40:15,240
You usually get into the coffee
business.

2313
01:40:15,241 --> 01:40:17,970
You're asking the right questions in
general.

2314
01:40:17,970 --> 01:40:19,830
We don't have very many examples of
that.

2315
01:40:20,090 --> 01:40:22,530
Um,
because only recently have people

2316
01:40:22,531 --> 01:40:24,390
started to move coffee around.
But,

2317
01:40:24,810 --> 01:40:29,810
but I tasted once a coffee from a farm
in El Salvador that had the kenyan

2318
01:40:31,410 --> 01:40:33,440
coffees from this,
uh,

2319
01:40:33,540 --> 01:40:37,140
this place in neary planted on it.
And I,

2320
01:40:37,141 --> 01:40:41,250
at the time I didn't know anything but I
was tasting this coffee and I accused

2321
01:40:41,280 --> 01:40:45,000
the guy that was working in my lab with
me of making a mistake.

2322
01:40:45,330 --> 01:40:47,610
It tastes like kenyan coffee,
huh?

2323
01:40:47,640 --> 01:40:48,940
So,
uh,

2324
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:54,000
it's the varieties that have grown to
these places that are in many ways

2325
01:40:54,281 --> 01:40:56,980
determine these flavors.
there's also a farm in,

2326
01:40:57,910 --> 01:40:58,743
in,
uh,

2327
01:40:58,840 --> 01:41:03,700
in Panama that was kind of accidentally
planted with some coffees from Ethiopia

2328
01:41:04,090 --> 01:41:05,860
and the coffee tastes like ethiopian
coffee.

2329
01:41:05,980 --> 01:41:06,731
Really?
Yeah.

2330
01:41:06,731 --> 01:41:09,940
So is there a similarity in the climate?

2331
01:41:10,450 --> 01:41:11,930
Yeah,
if the climate is the same and they've.

2332
01:41:11,970 --> 01:41:13,990
Coffee variety is the same because
remember,

2333
01:41:13,991 --> 01:41:16,390
all these thousands of varieties that
exist in the world,

2334
01:41:16,780 --> 01:41:18,490
you know,
if in,

2335
01:41:18,520 --> 01:41:19,810
in,
in yoga chef,

2336
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:21,640
they grow three different varieties
there.

2337
01:41:22,570 --> 01:41:25,930
If you go to yoga chef and ask a farmer
what varieties of coffee he's growing,

2338
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:30,550
he's got a choice of three m and they're
different from anywhere else in the

2339
01:41:30,551 --> 01:41:32,350
world.
Those they look different.

2340
01:41:32,351 --> 01:41:33,600
You can see that they're different,

2341
01:41:33,680 --> 01:41:35,240
right?
Like those little tiny ones that we

2342
01:41:35,250 --> 01:41:36,580
have.
Exactly the,

2343
01:41:36,970 --> 01:41:37,850
it's called [inaudible].

2344
01:41:38,210 --> 01:41:40,630
A mocha.
Yeah.

2345
01:41:40,631 --> 01:41:42,690
Mocha is the variety.
So mlk,

2346
01:41:42,691 --> 01:41:45,790
k a.
This came from Yemen somehow and made it

2347
01:41:45,791 --> 01:41:47,110
to Hawaii and they planned it.

2348
01:41:47,470 --> 01:41:50,940
That's rusty's hawaiian by the way.
And it's really delicious and really

2349
01:41:50,941 --> 01:41:52,080
tiny.
They're like little,

2350
01:41:52,180 --> 01:41:54,980
they're like seeds,
almost like bbs.

2351
01:41:55,040 --> 01:41:55,780
Yeah.
Yeah,

2352
01:41:55,780 --> 01:41:56,850
yeah.
That's a good way to describe it.

2353
01:41:56,851 --> 01:41:57,870
On pbs.
Yeah.

2354
01:41:58,290 --> 01:42:01,110
Um,
so how often do you travel around the

2355
01:42:01,111 --> 01:42:05,010
world helping people define the flavors
of their coffees?

2356
01:42:05,210 --> 01:42:07,480
Well now I have a kid so I don't do it
as much anymore,

2357
01:42:07,490 --> 01:42:09,650
but there was a,
there was a decade there where I would

2358
01:42:09,651 --> 01:42:13,100
travel a one year,
200 days in a year.

2359
01:42:13,160 --> 01:42:13,730
Well,
it waS,

2360
01:42:13,730 --> 01:42:14,580
I was,
uh,

2361
01:42:14,581 --> 01:42:17,150
I was just bugged out of your mind doing
coffee.

2362
01:42:17,210 --> 01:42:18,570
Yeah.
Yeah.

2363
01:42:18,600 --> 01:42:20,840
Tasting it more than a lot of times,
by the way,

2364
01:42:20,841 --> 01:42:24,880
when we're tasting coffee will spit it
out so you don't get too fucked up.

2365
01:42:24,890 --> 01:42:26,990
They just taste it and spit it.
That's interesting.

2366
01:42:26,991 --> 01:42:28,910
Do you feel bad about spitting it out?
Sometimes?

2367
01:42:29,210 --> 01:42:30,410
Sometimes you don't.
If you don't,

2368
01:42:30,411 --> 01:42:32,510
if stute delicious and you don't want
to,

2369
01:42:32,511 --> 01:42:33,440
you can just drink,
drink it.

2370
01:42:33,441 --> 01:42:35,190
Yeah.
Wow.

2371
01:42:35,480 --> 01:42:36,313
But,
um,

2372
01:42:37,400 --> 01:42:38,690
but yeah,
but there's a lot of.

2373
01:42:38,780 --> 01:42:40,580
I mean it's not just me.
There's lots of,

2374
01:42:40,640 --> 01:42:42,560
there's lots of people out there right
now.

2375
01:42:42,561 --> 01:42:45,350
In fact,
I was chatting with a guy and in Kenya

2376
01:42:45,351 --> 01:42:47,650
this morning,
now what can be done

2377
01:42:47,700 --> 01:42:52,700
about the soil itself is their
composting then improves the health of

2378
01:42:52,831 --> 01:42:53,410
the plant.

2379
01:42:53,410 --> 01:42:55,140
Question that.
Yeah,

2380
01:42:55,141 --> 01:42:59,550
that one of the issues with coffee is
you take all this coffee out from a farm

2381
01:42:59,551 --> 01:43:02,820
and wherever,
Kenya and you bring the coffee here,

2382
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:05,280
but you got to,
you got to be bringing stuff back to the

2383
01:43:05,281 --> 01:43:09,360
soil all the time.
And otherwise the soil will be depleted.

2384
01:43:09,361 --> 01:43:12,060
So getting nutrients back in the soil is
really important.

2385
01:43:12,061 --> 01:43:14,130
Composting is a big deal.
It's good to have,

2386
01:43:14,680 --> 01:43:19,680
um,
access to manure if you can from cattle

2387
01:43:19,801 --> 01:43:21,760
or chickens or whatever that they put
it.

2388
01:43:21,761 --> 01:43:22,594
It's a lot

2389
01:43:23,030 --> 01:43:26,720
preferred type of manure that you use.
It depends on the soil because I know

2390
01:43:26,721 --> 01:43:29,750
people are really in a chicken shit.
Chicken shit is great because we have

2391
01:43:29,751 --> 01:43:32,810
chickens and people asking us for our
shit.

2392
01:43:32,820 --> 01:43:34,030
Yeah.
Well it's like,

2393
01:43:34,140 --> 01:43:36,510
it's like dynamite.
That stuff.

2394
01:43:36,560 --> 01:43:38,410
It's weird.
People ask me for shit.

2395
01:43:38,870 --> 01:43:42,100
Um,
so what about like rotten vegetables?

2396
01:43:42,610 --> 01:43:44,130
Most any

2397
01:43:44,130 --> 01:43:48,150
good coffee farm will have a gigantic
compost heap that they,

2398
01:43:48,240 --> 01:43:53,240
that they have the coffee pulp and like
that from when they process the coffee

2399
01:43:53,720 --> 01:43:56,240
plus manure,
chicken manure,

2400
01:43:56,300 --> 01:43:57,170
all sorts of stuff

2401
01:43:57,240 --> 01:44:01,530
and this is all sort of leave and,
and like piled up and then it's evenly

2402
01:44:01,531 --> 01:44:02,790
distributed over the farm

2403
01:44:03,090 --> 01:44:05,220
and then they have to carry it.
So farmers,

2404
01:44:05,221 --> 01:44:10,221
we'll put it in a bag on their back and
walk up these mountains and like put,

2405
01:44:12,030 --> 01:44:16,200
you know,
two or three kilograms of manure on each

2406
01:44:16,201 --> 01:44:19,530
coffee plant.
Now one coffee plant will produce about

2407
01:44:19,531 --> 01:44:23,700
a pound of coffee in a year.
So this gives you an idea how much work

2408
01:44:23,701 --> 01:44:24,090
it is.

2409
01:44:24,090 --> 01:44:25,500
That's insane.
It's crazy.

2410
01:44:25,620 --> 01:44:29,250
one coffee plant produces a full bag of
coffee in one year.

2411
01:44:29,280 --> 01:44:30,320
In a year.
Yeah.

2412
01:44:30,390 --> 01:44:32,820
So why isn't coffee a million dollars?
that's a great question.

2413
01:44:34,380 --> 01:44:36,510
What would happen if coffee can be grown
in the United States?

2414
01:44:36,511 --> 01:44:38,220
It is probably would cost a million
dollars.

2415
01:44:38,490 --> 01:44:38,950
What?
YoU know,

2416
01:44:38,950 --> 01:44:40,620
that's why you know,
straight.

2417
01:44:40,800 --> 01:44:45,090
This was probably pretty expensive.
This straight hawaiian coffee.

2418
01:44:45,650 --> 01:44:47,000
Oh yeah.
It was not cheap at all.

2419
01:44:47,600 --> 01:44:48,830
It's very expensive.
I think it's like,

2420
01:44:49,010 --> 01:44:49,843
well,
I forget,

2421
01:44:49,910 --> 01:44:50,610
I shouldn't say

2422
01:44:50,610 --> 01:44:51,391
yeah,
but anyway,

2423
01:44:51,391 --> 01:44:54,750
it's a lot of money and that's why it's
because it's because it's incredibly

2424
01:44:54,751 --> 01:44:55,680
laboR intensive.

2425
01:44:55,780 --> 01:44:56,890
Yeah.
That's amazing.

2426
01:44:57,100 --> 01:45:01,480
Now I'm,
the issue that they're having with a lot

2427
01:45:01,481 --> 01:45:04,030
of farms is the depletion of the soil,
correct.

2428
01:45:04,570 --> 01:45:07,690
Minerally deficient soils had been,
that's been an issue with farmers since

2429
01:45:07,691 --> 01:45:10,300
the 19 twenties when they first started
realizing.

2430
01:45:10,490 --> 01:45:11,190
Yeah.
And,

2431
01:45:11,190 --> 01:45:12,870
and then so,
um,

2432
01:45:13,020 --> 01:45:15,070
and this is a big challenge for all
agriculture but,

2433
01:45:15,180 --> 01:45:19,880
but coffee is no different how to
maintain fertility in your soil without,

2434
01:45:19,910 --> 01:45:23,630
because it takes a lot of work,
like a lot of labor to get stuff back.

2435
01:45:23,720 --> 01:45:24,980
And then,
um,

2436
01:45:25,070 --> 01:45:28,560
so chemical fertilizers,
another option for,

2437
01:45:28,640 --> 01:45:31,730
for farmers they use.
But that's a problem too because It

2438
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:33,470
takes energy to make,
you know,

2439
01:45:33,890 --> 01:45:37,550
they burn gas basically to make npk
fertilizer,

2440
01:45:37,551 --> 01:45:42,230
which is chemical fertilizer.
So organic farms don't use that kind of

2441
01:45:42,231 --> 01:45:44,090
fertilizer.
They make their own with compost,

2442
01:45:44,091 --> 01:45:47,810
but it's so much effort.
It's just a huge lead,

2443
01:45:47,830 --> 01:45:49,790
expensive undertaking to do.
so it's a challenge.

2444
01:45:49,791 --> 01:45:52,220
It's one of the things that we face and
we talk about a lot in coffee.

2445
01:45:52,270 --> 01:45:56,490
Is there a variation in the flavor of a
plant that's been fertilized with the

2446
01:45:56,500 --> 01:46:00,670
chemical feRtilizer or synthetic or
whatever you call it as versed as

2447
01:46:00,671 --> 01:46:01,900
opposed to compost?

2448
01:46:01,980 --> 01:46:03,480
No,
as long as the.

2449
01:46:03,481 --> 01:46:07,410
As long as the plant is healthy,
it's possible to make it healthy in both

2450
01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:09,570
those ways.
So if the plant's healthy,

2451
01:46:09,571 --> 01:46:10,710
it's gonna make good coffee,

2452
01:46:10,980 --> 01:46:14,970
but it seems like a huge difference in
the chemical process itself.

2453
01:46:14,971 --> 01:46:15,690
Right?
Yeah.

2454
01:46:15,690 --> 01:46:17,840
I mean you obviously have to burn things
in order to.

2455
01:46:18,570 --> 01:46:19,660
It's like it's.
Yeah.

2456
01:46:20,020 --> 01:46:20,641
And,
and,

2457
01:46:20,641 --> 01:46:21,640
and,
and then there are,

2458
01:46:21,880 --> 01:46:23,760
there's a lot of middle ground too.
I mean,

2459
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:27,150
I would say most,
most good farmers or many good farmers

2460
01:46:27,151 --> 01:46:31,290
use a little bit of,
of synthetic fertilizer and a little bit

2461
01:46:31,291 --> 01:46:32,690
of compost as well,
and they kind of

2462
01:46:33,360 --> 01:46:35,160
multivitamins with a good diet.

2463
01:46:35,180 --> 01:46:38,840
That's exactly what it's like using
chemical fertilizer is the same as using

2464
01:46:38,841 --> 01:46:39,840
vitamin supplements.

2465
01:46:40,040 --> 01:46:42,290
You ever heard of a guy named dr joel
wallach?

2466
01:46:42,380 --> 01:46:45,050
No.
He's a doctor who wrote a book called

2467
01:46:45,051 --> 01:46:48,290
dead doctors don't lie and saw about
minerally sufficient,

2468
01:46:48,360 --> 01:46:53,360
insufficient soils and about a real
epidemic we have with minerally

2469
01:46:53,701 --> 01:46:55,110
deficient diets.
Now.

2470
01:46:55,111 --> 01:46:56,700
I don't know how much of what he said.
It's fuckery.

2471
01:46:57,050 --> 01:46:58,610
I need to really probably talk to
someone.

2472
01:46:58,620 --> 01:47:00,780
I'll talk to dr rhonda,
patrick about it.

2473
01:47:00,781 --> 01:47:03,090
Choose one of the guests that we have on
the podcast.

2474
01:47:03,091 --> 01:47:06,660
I'll say an actual scientist and yeah,
she really understands what she's

2475
01:47:06,661 --> 01:47:10,410
talking about,
but this guy was talking about areas in

2476
01:47:10,411 --> 01:47:14,040
the world where people live to be much
longer or live to me much older and

2477
01:47:14,041 --> 01:47:17,460
we're healthier and had darker hair
longer and that it was because they were

2478
01:47:17,461 --> 01:47:22,461
getting something called glacial milk,
which is the runoff like water from

2479
01:47:23,250 --> 01:47:26,010
glaciers.
They actually had like a milky quality

2480
01:47:26,011 --> 01:47:31,011
to it because it was so minerally rich
right now as their areas like that where

2481
01:47:31,201 --> 01:47:34,790
they grow coffee,
which minerally rich coffee people

2482
01:47:34,820 --> 01:47:38,050
like the legend.
There's a lot of legends and coffee.

2483
01:47:38,270 --> 01:47:38,860
Well,
yeah,

2484
01:47:38,860 --> 01:47:41,780
I mean about special areas that make
special coffee.

2485
01:47:41,800 --> 01:47:42,470
You know,
and you.

2486
01:47:42,470 --> 01:47:47,120
You mentioned earlier volcanic soils,
places that have volcanic soil that the

2487
01:47:47,121 --> 01:47:48,680
farmers,
if their coffee is great,

2488
01:47:48,681 --> 01:47:50,960
they will attribute it to all of these
things.

2489
01:47:51,410 --> 01:47:56,060
But so far there's not a lot of like
actual evidence to support any of that.

2490
01:47:56,360 --> 01:47:57,350
Um,
uh,

2491
01:47:58,250 --> 01:48:01,760
all it is is we know and we're
discovering these things all the time.

2492
01:48:01,761 --> 01:48:04,040
You know,
it's like what is the magic?

2493
01:48:04,550 --> 01:48:07,160
I'm sort of mixture of the right
variety,

2494
01:48:07,161 --> 01:48:09,920
the right climate,
the right kind of soil composition,

2495
01:48:09,921 --> 01:48:11,750
the right kind of husbandry.
It's this,

2496
01:48:12,080 --> 01:48:14,110
it's so many factors together.
It's,

2497
01:48:14,270 --> 01:48:16,910
I don't think it makes sense to isolate
one thing.

2498
01:48:17,390 --> 01:48:21,830
Another thing that people always ask me
is like if they're growing pine trees on

2499
01:48:21,831 --> 01:48:25,160
the farm with their green coffee,
can you tease the pine trees in the,

2500
01:48:25,730 --> 01:48:26,630
in the,
uh,

2501
01:48:27,020 --> 01:48:28,250
in the coffee itself.

2502
01:48:29,090 --> 01:48:32,190
And I'm pretty sure that there's no,
there's no way that,

2503
01:48:32,191 --> 01:48:32,780
that,
I mean,

2504
01:48:32,780 --> 01:48:34,310
I've never experienced that,
you know,

2505
01:48:34,490 --> 01:48:35,323
but people,
there's,

2506
01:48:35,330 --> 01:48:38,900
these legends kind of come up are around
cost and you do,

2507
01:48:38,990 --> 01:48:43,270
you do taste amazing things in coffee
that are inexplicably,

2508
01:48:43,290 --> 01:48:47,480
like that coffee that we just drank.
The definitely smells like lemons,

2509
01:48:47,481 --> 01:48:48,171
right?
Well,

2510
01:48:48,171 --> 01:48:49,760
it smells like a tea.
Yeah.

2511
01:48:49,761 --> 01:48:51,050
Like lemon tea.
Right.

2512
01:48:51,120 --> 01:48:52,850
And it tastes good even when it cools.
Oh yeah,

2513
01:48:52,851 --> 01:48:54,280
taste better.
I noticed that too.

2514
01:48:55,040 --> 01:48:56,510
It's just,
it's,

2515
01:48:56,930 --> 01:48:58,820
I don't know why is,
that's not the case with a lot of

2516
01:48:58,821 --> 01:48:59,440
coffee.
No,

2517
01:48:59,440 --> 01:48:59,691
no,
no,

2518
01:48:59,691 --> 01:49:01,040
that's right.
Why is that?

2519
01:49:01,070 --> 01:49:03,950
What's.
Well coffee is,

2520
01:49:03,980 --> 01:49:08,720
we'll continue to extract over time.
So whIle it's been sitting in this,

2521
01:49:08,810 --> 01:49:10,760
in this thing,
it's continuing to extract.

2522
01:49:10,761 --> 01:49:13,820
It's going from,
maybe it was maybe 18 percent when I

2523
01:49:13,821 --> 01:49:18,290
pledged it in terms of percentage of
extraction and it keeps on going up as

2524
01:49:18,291 --> 01:49:21,080
it sits and so it'll evolve in terms of
flavor.

2525
01:49:21,320 --> 01:49:24,350
The other thing that changes is you.
So,

2526
01:49:24,770 --> 01:49:28,760
uh,
so there's this thing called habituation

2527
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:32,390
in tasting things.
And uh,

2528
01:49:32,810 --> 01:49:36,650
I wasn't completely hip to this until I
taste scientist.

2529
01:49:36,860 --> 01:49:37,720
Um,
he,

2530
01:49:37,760 --> 01:49:39,920
he did this demonstration for me and he
did it with wine.

2531
01:49:39,921 --> 01:49:42,590
He said he,
he gave me a glass of this,

2532
01:49:42,680 --> 01:49:47,680
this,
a white wine from a New Zealand and he

2533
01:49:48,520 --> 01:49:49,770
had me taste it and he said,
you,

2534
01:49:49,840 --> 01:49:52,690
you taste that green bell pepper note in
this.

2535
01:49:52,691 --> 01:49:54,280
You know,
and that's the thing that they say about

2536
01:49:54,310 --> 01:49:55,690
wines from this area and I said,
yeah,

2537
01:49:55,691 --> 01:49:56,710
I can taste it,
and he says okay,

2538
01:49:57,160 --> 01:50:00,460
and then he gave me a little bit of
actual green bell pepper and he said,

2539
01:50:00,490 --> 01:50:01,690
eat that,
and I did.

2540
01:50:02,610 --> 01:50:03,251
And then he said,
Okay,

2541
01:50:03,251 --> 01:50:05,740
now taste the wine again,
and I tasted the wine again and it

2542
01:50:05,741 --> 01:50:07,240
tastes Like a completely different wine.

2543
01:50:08,410 --> 01:50:09,400
And I said,
what happened?

2544
01:50:09,401 --> 01:50:10,181
He said,
okay,

2545
01:50:10,181 --> 01:50:14,050
so that,
that wine had this chemical in it and he

2546
01:50:14,051 --> 01:50:15,610
named the chemical.
I don't remember what it was,

2547
01:50:15,611 --> 01:50:18,120
but it was the green bell pepper
chemical and then he's.

2548
01:50:18,250 --> 01:50:19,900
And then when he gave me the green bell
pepper,

2549
01:50:19,901 --> 01:50:24,160
it overwhelmed my senses with that same
smell.

2550
01:50:24,250 --> 01:50:26,370
And so you know how if you're,
if,

2551
01:50:26,640 --> 01:50:29,420
if you use windex in your house,
you smell it for a while and you're

2552
01:50:29,421 --> 01:50:31,870
overwhelmed by it and then in a few
minutes you can't smell it anymore.

2553
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:35,020
It's not that it's gone away,
it's just that your brain has sort of

2554
01:50:35,021 --> 01:50:36,100
screened it out.

2555
01:50:36,560 --> 01:50:39,380
Well,
all factory senses dePend on change.

2556
01:50:39,800 --> 01:50:40,633
Exactly.

2557
01:50:40,810 --> 01:50:43,390
And so once you get used to something,
you can't smell it anymore.

2558
01:50:43,420 --> 01:50:45,010
Yes.
And so it.

2559
01:50:45,011 --> 01:50:47,980
Same thinG happens with coffee.
If you're drinking coffee and there's an

2560
01:50:47,981 --> 01:50:51,520
overwhelming element than your,
your olfactory,

2561
01:50:51,521 --> 01:50:54,010
we'll screen it out and then you start
tasting different things.

2562
01:50:55,330 --> 01:50:57,460
So tHings change over time.

2563
01:50:57,510 --> 01:51:01,130
So smell certainly does enhance tastes
or change tastes.

2564
01:51:01,250 --> 01:51:01,661
Yeah.
In,

2565
01:51:01,661 --> 01:51:03,680
in coffee especially,
it's,

2566
01:51:03,770 --> 01:51:05,990
it's at least half of thing.

2567
01:51:06,210 --> 01:51:08,850
It doesn't whine as well.
Like I find that like,

2568
01:51:08,910 --> 01:51:11,400
you know,
a good wine like are like red wine.

2569
01:51:11,401 --> 01:51:14,640
When I smell a good red wIne,
like the smell of it actually makes it

2570
01:51:14,641 --> 01:51:15,840
seem somewhat more delicious.

2571
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,860
Yeah.
Will flavor the definition of flavor is

2572
01:51:18,861 --> 01:51:22,880
the,
is the combination of aromatic and taste

2573
01:51:23,210 --> 01:51:25,090
together.
So if you eliminate it,

2574
01:51:25,091 --> 01:51:27,770
if you have a cold or something and you
eliminate your aromatics,

2575
01:51:27,830 --> 01:51:31,790
suddenly food doesn't taste right.
Nothing is right because you're only

2576
01:51:31,791 --> 01:51:32,870
tasting sweet,
sour,

2577
01:51:32,871 --> 01:51:33,411
salty,
bitter,

2578
01:51:33,411 --> 01:51:35,750
and savory,
which is what you can experience on your

2579
01:51:35,751 --> 01:51:40,040
tongue.
But your nose is able to get thousands

2580
01:51:40,041 --> 01:51:40,970
of things.
So there's this,

2581
01:51:41,030 --> 01:51:43,040
there's this phenomenon that happens
when you're tasting things.

2582
01:51:43,810 --> 01:51:45,370
Um,
and uh,

2583
01:51:45,560 --> 01:51:46,393
it's,
it,

2584
01:51:46,640 --> 01:51:51,640
it's called retro nasal,
so when you swallow this is weird,

2585
01:51:51,861 --> 01:51:56,861
but you swallow something and then it
coats your throat and that the aromatics

2586
01:51:57,741 --> 01:52:01,580
kind of go backwards up through your
nose from your throat.

2587
01:52:01,850 --> 01:52:03,800
Whoa.
And um,

2588
01:52:03,980 --> 01:52:07,160
and it's,
that's called retro nasal from the back

2589
01:52:07,161 --> 01:52:10,610
of your notes and so you're actually
smelling things at the same time that

2590
01:52:10,611 --> 01:52:11,690
you're swallowing them.

2591
01:52:11,710 --> 01:52:15,160
That is fascinating.
Is there any restaurant in the los

2592
01:52:15,161 --> 01:52:17,680
angeles area that gets the whole thing
right?

2593
01:52:18,100 --> 01:52:22,030
Like great food,
great wine and great coffee.

2594
01:52:23,020 --> 01:52:25,480
That's a great question.
Why doesn't someone nailed that?

2595
01:52:25,481 --> 01:52:28,540
Somebody should.
Somebody should have like coffee,

2596
01:52:28,541 --> 01:52:29,470
like this.
Yeah,

2597
01:52:29,560 --> 01:52:33,700
like the Perfect cup of coffee roasted
March 4th,

2598
01:52:33,820 --> 01:52:35,530
you know,
so roasted a week ago.

2599
01:52:35,680 --> 01:52:37,730
What's today's date?
What's the offIcial day right now?

2600
01:52:37,731 --> 01:52:39,280
It's the 17th.
What is it?

2601
01:52:39,400 --> 01:52:40,540
10th,
10th the 10th.

2602
01:52:40,810 --> 01:52:41,980
So six,
six,

2603
01:52:41,981 --> 01:52:42,550
six,
17.

2604
01:52:42,550 --> 01:52:43,460
I don't know what day it is.
Yeah.

2605
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:46,070
How about that?
Seven days off.

2606
01:52:46,170 --> 01:52:48,140
Yeah,
I knew it was one of those mondays.

2607
01:52:48,470 --> 01:52:50,660
Um,
so six days ago.

2608
01:52:50,661 --> 01:52:53,780
It's really recently roasted.
That Would be an amazing thing for

2609
01:52:53,781 --> 01:52:57,470
someone to pull off in a restaurant,
have like really delicious wines to go

2610
01:52:57,471 --> 01:53:01,070
with really delicious food and have the
same effort put into the coffee's.

2611
01:53:01,430 --> 01:53:04,220
A few restaurants are starting to really
work on it and drill it right.

2612
01:53:04,221 --> 01:53:06,170
Yeah.
And what do they know that I know of in

2613
01:53:06,171 --> 01:53:07,280
la,
but none.

2614
01:53:07,310 --> 01:53:08,400
But how dare you?
La?

2615
01:53:08,420 --> 01:53:10,250
Yeah.
I'm sure there might be.

2616
01:53:10,251 --> 01:53:11,910
I just haven't been there yet.
San francisco must,

2617
01:53:12,440 --> 01:53:14,240
uh,
san francisco has a couple.

2618
01:53:14,260 --> 01:53:17,480
There was one in baltimore of all places
really?

2619
01:53:17,660 --> 01:53:20,910
That did an amazing job.
Is it still open woodberry kitchen yet?

2620
01:53:20,911 --> 01:53:23,100
It's still a great coffee service.
Amazing coffee,

2621
01:53:23,101 --> 01:53:23,480
sir.

2622
01:53:23,480 --> 01:53:26,280
Amazing conference service and amazing
food is amazing.

2623
01:53:26,370 --> 01:53:27,210
I mean,
the guy,

2624
01:53:27,211 --> 01:53:29,550
this guy named spike does this.
I mean,

2625
01:53:29,551 --> 01:53:31,050
he is amazing.
This dude.

2626
01:53:31,170 --> 01:53:32,430
Well,
I'm going to get that number from you

2627
01:53:32,431 --> 01:53:34,980
because I'm going there in a couple of
weeks in baltimore.

2628
01:53:35,010 --> 01:53:36,370
Oh,
you have to eat it with kitchen.

2629
01:53:36,500 --> 01:53:37,560
It's great.
I'm gone.

2630
01:53:37,620 --> 01:53:38,520
Yeah.
Done.

2631
01:53:38,660 --> 01:53:39,390
Yeah.
How about that?

2632
01:53:39,390 --> 01:53:40,260
Yeah.
Wow.

2633
01:53:40,650 --> 01:53:41,490
Um,
awesome.

2634
01:53:41,540 --> 01:53:42,200
Um,
what,

2635
01:53:42,200 --> 01:53:44,070
what else can we talk about when it
comes to coffee?

2636
01:53:44,071 --> 01:53:45,120
Is there anything that we missed?

2637
01:53:45,450 --> 01:53:46,220
No,
I mean,

2638
01:53:46,220 --> 01:53:48,490
uh,
no.

2639
01:53:48,500 --> 01:53:49,520
I don't knoW.
I mean the,

2640
01:53:49,710 --> 01:53:50,543
the,
uh,

2641
01:53:50,940 --> 01:53:52,400
the,
some of the things that,

2642
01:53:52,770 --> 01:53:53,603
that,
uh,

2643
01:53:53,790 --> 01:53:56,370
people always want to know is about
decaf.

2644
01:53:56,730 --> 01:53:57,780
Yes.
That was another thing.

2645
01:53:57,781 --> 01:53:58,140
I,
yeah.

2646
01:53:58,140 --> 01:53:59,010
I'm glad you brought that up.

2647
01:53:59,240 --> 01:54:00,200
Yeah.
Well,

2648
01:54:00,201 --> 01:54:02,360
I mean it's the thing you see when you
work in coffee,

2649
01:54:02,361 --> 01:54:05,780
you go to cocktail parties or something.
People always ask you these questions.

2650
01:54:05,781 --> 01:54:08,000
They ask you what's your favorite coffee
and why?

2651
01:54:08,780 --> 01:54:10,730
Because they want to know.
They also want to know what the deal

2652
01:54:10,731 --> 01:54:12,590
with decaf is,
is what is the deal?

2653
01:54:12,650 --> 01:54:13,483
Well,
I mean,

2654
01:54:13,700 --> 01:54:18,700
so coffee has this alkaloid a caffeine
and um,

2655
01:54:19,970 --> 01:54:23,950
and then you have to get it out.
So the first way that they got it out as

2656
01:54:23,951 --> 01:54:25,820
they use it,
a solvent like,

2657
01:54:25,821 --> 01:54:27,310
uh,
like paint thinner.

2658
01:54:27,340 --> 01:54:29,720
Yeah.
Kind of more like dry cleaning solvent.

2659
01:54:29,750 --> 01:54:31,850
This is god.
This is a,

2660
01:54:31,890 --> 01:54:36,230
a 100 Years ago.
And they noticed that it was able to

2661
01:54:36,231 --> 01:54:39,140
take the caffeine out and that was the
original.

2662
01:54:39,410 --> 01:54:41,350
But nobody who wants to use that in
there.

2663
01:54:41,630 --> 01:54:46,630
So over the years they've developed
better ways of doing it using carbon

2664
01:54:46,821 --> 01:54:50,840
dioxide or charcoal filters to get the,
to get the caffeine out.

2665
01:54:50,940 --> 01:54:55,320
And how much do you actually get out?
Because I had heard that starbucks has a

2666
01:54:55,321 --> 01:54:59,310
particularly high caffeine content of
their regular coffee and that there

2667
01:54:59,311 --> 01:55:02,910
might be a little bit left to that when
you have decaf sound right to me.

2668
01:55:02,960 --> 01:55:03,793
No,
no,

2669
01:55:04,830 --> 01:55:06,760
I,
I don't see any reason why starbucks

2670
01:55:06,761 --> 01:55:08,320
would have a higher caffeine content

2671
01:55:08,390 --> 01:55:10,640
of their coffee.
So it's just an urban legend.

2672
01:55:10,641 --> 01:55:11,990
Sounds like engine to me.
Yeah.

2673
01:55:12,240 --> 01:55:13,960
Um,
what about the decaf,

2674
01:55:13,970 --> 01:55:16,910
does it have any caffeine in it at all
or is it trace amounts?

2675
01:55:16,950 --> 01:55:18,200
Trace trace

2676
01:55:18,300 --> 01:55:19,410
and,
and uh,

2677
01:55:19,680 --> 01:55:21,810
uh,
so,

2678
01:55:21,900 --> 01:55:23,760
you know,
people that are like allergic sensitive

2679
01:55:23,761 --> 01:55:25,740
to it shouldn't drink decaffeinated
coffee,

2680
01:55:26,130 --> 01:55:29,150
but,
but people that are uh,

2681
01:55:29,740 --> 01:55:30,720
uh,
but you know,

2682
01:55:30,750 --> 01:55:33,690
most and each of these methods is
slightly different,

2683
01:55:34,350 --> 01:55:37,800
but trace amounts of caffeine and
decaffeinated coffee,

2684
01:55:37,830 --> 01:55:39,690
that's good.
The good methods,

2685
01:55:39,691 --> 01:55:41,430
the swiss water process,
for example,

2686
01:55:41,431 --> 01:55:43,400
you may have heard of,
um,

2687
01:55:44,250 --> 01:55:45,090
is,
uh,

2688
01:55:45,120 --> 01:55:47,700
is one,
there's a number of these methods that

2689
01:55:47,701 --> 01:55:50,310
are really good at getting,
getting the caffeine out and not

2690
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:51,600
destroying the flavor of the coffee.

2691
01:55:51,640 --> 01:55:55,230
So what is the law says?
Starbucks tall decaf.

2692
01:55:55,231 --> 01:55:56,560
A tall,
which is a small.

2693
01:55:56,830 --> 01:55:59,710
Has nine point five milligrams of
caffeine in it.

2694
01:55:59,740 --> 01:56:02,410
Okay.
What is a normal cup of coffee habit?

2695
01:56:02,900 --> 01:56:05,390
Like a hundred 50,
200 years.

2696
01:56:05,420 --> 01:56:08,150
So that's the tray.
So it's a little bit,

2697
01:56:08,151 --> 01:56:10,340
a little bit,
but it's not caffeine free.

2698
01:56:10,341 --> 01:56:11,700
It's just low caffeine.
Yeah.

2699
01:56:11,930 --> 01:56:13,250
but that's pretty low.
I mean,

2700
01:56:13,280 --> 01:56:14,061
you know.
Sure.

2701
01:56:14,061 --> 01:56:17,420
But unless you're super sensitive to it.
But if you have a 20 ounce decaf you're

2702
01:56:17,421 --> 01:56:18,920
getting.
What about 18?

2703
01:56:18,921 --> 01:56:20,840
Maybe sort of double.
What does that.

2704
01:56:20,841 --> 01:56:22,850
A 16 ounce.
Sixteen ounces double,

2705
01:56:22,851 --> 01:56:24,440
right?
Because that's an eight is a tall and

2706
01:56:24,441 --> 01:56:24,890
eight.
Now,

2707
01:56:24,890 --> 01:56:28,500
I don't know.
This is the starbucks bar language that

2708
01:56:28,520 --> 01:56:31,490
don't write well.
They're get all goofy with grande's.

2709
01:56:31,530 --> 01:56:33,720
Call him.
I know venti is 20 ounces.

2710
01:56:33,721 --> 01:56:34,431
I know.
Yeah.

2711
01:56:34,431 --> 01:56:35,780
That's silly.
Called medium.

2712
01:56:35,781 --> 01:56:38,600
Just don't call it tall either.
That shit ain't tall.

2713
01:56:38,780 --> 01:56:41,180
And what world?
Gulliver travels.

2714
01:56:41,630 --> 01:56:43,700
What world is that tall?
It's ridiculous.

2715
01:56:43,890 --> 01:56:47,660
Yeah.
So if someone is a really sensitive to

2716
01:56:47,661 --> 01:56:50,690
caffeine though,
they can also still probably get a

2717
01:56:50,691 --> 01:56:52,080
little bit of a caffeine kick.
Yeah,

2718
01:56:52,081 --> 01:56:53,270
that's true.
if there's a decaf,

2719
01:56:53,280 --> 01:56:55,940
they're super sensitive to it.
So it's not caffeine free.

2720
01:56:56,020 --> 01:56:57,770
It's not.
Yeah.

2721
01:56:58,160 --> 01:57:01,510
I guess called decaf but it's not
decaffeinated.

2722
01:57:01,540 --> 01:57:02,680
It's only.
Mostly.

2723
01:57:02,710 --> 01:57:04,270
It's mostly decaf.
Decaffeinated.

2724
01:57:04,271 --> 01:57:05,130
Yeah.
Um,

2725
01:57:05,131 --> 01:57:06,250
but the flavor,

2726
01:57:06,520 --> 01:57:07,211
right?
Well,

2727
01:57:07,211 --> 01:57:09,970
so now the flavors.
Okay,

2728
01:57:10,090 --> 01:57:10,930
great.
I've,

2729
01:57:11,050 --> 01:57:14,500
I've done this,
I've tasted great decaffeinate a great

2730
01:57:14,501 --> 01:57:19,501
coffee that becomes decaffeinated and
it's certainly the flavor is impacted by

2731
01:57:20,411 --> 01:57:22,390
caffeine,
by the removal of caffeine,

2732
01:57:22,391 --> 01:57:23,680
by the process that goes through,

2733
01:57:23,990 --> 01:57:26,120
but it's still delicious coffee.
Okay.

2734
01:57:26,121 --> 01:57:29,200
Like give us an example of a delicious
decaffeinated coffee that we should.

2735
01:57:30,090 --> 01:57:31,110
Well,
any of these,

2736
01:57:31,170 --> 01:57:34,050
any qa,
any coffee company that's like putting

2737
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:36,360
extraordinary care into their regular
coffee,

2738
01:57:36,870 --> 01:57:39,780
it's very likely that they will be
putting extraordinary care into their

2739
01:57:39,781 --> 01:57:41,580
decaf to.
And it Just,

2740
01:57:41,610 --> 01:57:43,380
you should ask them about it,
you know,

2741
01:57:43,530 --> 01:57:45,360
I mean,
uh,

2742
01:57:45,690 --> 01:57:46,890
uh,
you know,

2743
01:57:46,891 --> 01:57:50,670
if you engage with them and they weRe
proud of their decaf and his chances are

2744
01:57:50,940 --> 01:57:53,490
that they are putting a lot of care into
it.

2745
01:57:53,760 --> 01:57:54,870
And I know that,
okay,

2746
01:57:54,871 --> 01:57:58,650
I used to run a coffee company,
coffee program for a coffee company back

2747
01:57:58,651 --> 01:58:03,651
east called counterculture coffee and I
put extra effort into my decaffeinated

2748
01:58:04,921 --> 01:58:08,220
coffee because I knew that the people
that were drinking that we're drinking

2749
01:58:08,221 --> 01:58:12,270
it only for the flavor.
They weren't drinking it for the drug

2750
01:58:12,271 --> 01:58:13,740
effect.
They,

2751
01:58:13,890 --> 01:58:16,050
they just,
they cared enough about coffee that they

2752
01:58:16,051 --> 01:58:18,780
wanted to drink it just because of the
way that it tasted.

2753
01:58:19,020 --> 01:58:20,850
And I felt like that was a
responsibility,

2754
01:58:20,970 --> 01:58:21,620
you know,

2755
01:58:21,620 --> 01:58:25,220
that's a very interesting point because
you're not dealing with any people just

2756
01:58:25,221 --> 01:58:25,990
looking for a drug.

2757
01:58:25,990 --> 01:58:26,920
Right.
Right.

2758
01:58:27,110 --> 01:58:29,320
And,
and so and so,

2759
01:58:29,410 --> 01:58:30,243
uh,
but the,

2760
01:58:30,280 --> 01:58:31,113
I mean,
the problem,

2761
01:58:31,120 --> 01:58:36,120
the problem with decaf I think is that
consumers who drink decaffeinated

2762
01:58:37,451 --> 01:58:39,040
coffee,
they don't necessarily expect to pay

2763
01:58:39,041 --> 01:58:41,020
more.
They feel lIke it should be the same,

2764
01:58:41,680 --> 01:58:43,510
you know,
and I get that,

2765
01:58:43,630 --> 01:58:47,290
but it does cost money to put it through
the process of decaf

2766
01:58:47,290 --> 01:58:49,720
and eating well,
don't they feel like that most coffees

2767
01:58:49,721 --> 01:58:52,150
overpriced in the first place?
I don't think people really truly

2768
01:58:52,151 --> 01:58:56,470
realize the amount of effort when you
broke it down by one pound is one tree

2769
01:58:56,471 --> 01:58:58,330
for a fucking year.
It's totally true.

2770
01:58:58,360 --> 01:59:00,040
What is the,
is that an eight ounce bag of coffee?

2771
01:59:00,041 --> 01:59:00,910
What does that.
How many?

2772
01:59:00,911 --> 01:59:03,100
What was that?
This is bringing that real hawaiian

2773
01:59:03,101 --> 01:59:05,800
roasters.
Was that sales is probably 16 ounces.

2774
01:59:05,900 --> 01:59:07,340
Fourteen ounces,
14 ounces.

2775
01:59:07,341 --> 01:59:09,920
So it's essentially a year of one plant.
Yeah,

2776
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:11,650
that's an unbelievable man.
Yeah.

2777
01:59:11,790 --> 01:59:12,623
No,
it's crazy.

2778
01:59:12,880 --> 01:59:16,240
And you can get definitely 20 bucks or
whatever the hell it is.

2779
01:59:16,241 --> 01:59:17,070
So we have this idea

2780
01:59:17,070 --> 01:59:21,000
deal of the in the depression and nickel
cup of coffee and,

2781
01:59:21,380 --> 01:59:22,620
and uh,
you know,

2782
01:59:22,621 --> 01:59:25,070
that's what my grandparents had access
to a nickel cup of coffee

2783
01:59:26,800 --> 01:59:30,690
or a cup of coffee.
They think it's stupid.

2784
01:59:30,691 --> 01:59:32,070
Meanwhile,
grow your own coffee dummy.

2785
01:59:32,370 --> 01:59:34,320
Good luck.
But I mean that was intentional.

2786
01:59:34,321 --> 01:59:36,090
I mean,
restaurants at that time,

2787
01:59:36,570 --> 01:59:38,520
that was,
they were losing money on their five

2788
01:59:38,520 --> 01:59:40,050
cent,
cup of coffee's even in the twenties

2789
01:59:40,230 --> 01:59:42,090
really because,
but they did that.

2790
01:59:42,091 --> 01:59:44,010
It was sort of a lost leader.
They were trying to get people into the

2791
01:59:44,011 --> 01:59:44,844
restaurants,
you know,

2792
01:59:45,480 --> 01:59:46,410
so,
um,

2793
01:59:46,470 --> 01:59:50,250
but it kind of stuck in people's mind
that coffee should be cheap and,

2794
01:59:50,400 --> 01:59:51,630
and,
and it shouldn't be.

2795
01:59:51,631 --> 01:59:52,464
It's,
it,

2796
01:59:52,810 --> 01:59:57,060
it in my view,
coffee should be the best you can

2797
01:59:57,061 --> 02:00:00,900
possibly make it taste.
And then if that costs money,

2798
02:00:01,410 --> 02:00:02,510
whatever,
just drink.

2799
02:00:02,540 --> 02:00:04,100
Bless.
So let me ask you this.

2800
02:00:04,160 --> 02:00:07,460
Save your traveling across America and
you stop at a diner because you're

2801
02:00:07,461 --> 02:00:10,070
hungry.
And do you even fuck around even order a

2802
02:00:10,071 --> 02:00:11,780
cup of coffee?
Sometimes I do.

2803
02:00:11,810 --> 02:00:14,120
Sometimes I get sad when they bring you
out.

2804
02:00:14,121 --> 02:00:17,300
That little stupid white cop.
It is tasted.

2805
02:00:17,330 --> 02:00:18,740
I mean,
I love diners.

2806
02:00:19,040 --> 02:00:21,080
you know,
I love to eat at diners.

2807
02:00:21,380 --> 02:00:22,820
I freaking love,
but you don't love that.

2808
02:00:22,880 --> 02:00:23,780
Drink coffee there.

2809
02:00:24,030 --> 02:00:26,730
And I love pancakes and hash browns and
all that stuff.

2810
02:00:27,240 --> 02:00:31,890
And uh,
I wish that the few times I've gone to

2811
02:00:31,891 --> 02:00:34,860
places where the coffee was out

2812
02:00:35,540 --> 02:00:36,373
regionally.
Good.

2813
02:00:36,380 --> 02:00:37,580
And did they tell you it was really
good?

2814
02:00:37,581 --> 02:00:38,030
Cool.
Yeah.

2815
02:00:38,030 --> 02:00:40,130
Sometimes sometimes they're,
they're proud of their,

2816
02:00:40,500 --> 02:00:44,720
their deal and they all make it good.
So it's someone who takes as much effort

2817
02:00:44,721 --> 02:00:47,140
into their omelets,
right as they do into their craft.

2818
02:00:47,940 --> 02:00:48,711
Well,
it should be,

2819
02:00:48,711 --> 02:00:50,870
yeah,
it should be expected if it's

2820
02:00:50,990 --> 02:00:53,260
financially feasible,
but that's.

2821
02:00:53,270 --> 02:00:56,330
And That's what it comes down to.
People got to be willing to pay for good

2822
02:00:56,331 --> 02:00:58,070
stuff.
Like what does the bag like this

2823
02:00:58,071 --> 02:01:01,400
delicious bag of ethiopian.
You're A good show.

2824
02:01:02,390 --> 02:01:03,530
Good show.
Usually there'll be,

2825
02:01:03,950 --> 02:01:06,800
I don't know,
maybe 12 or $13.

2826
02:01:06,820 --> 02:01:08,030
Dude,
I'm going to sleep with this shit next

2827
02:01:08,031 --> 02:01:09,230
to my pillow.
It's good.

2828
02:01:09,440 --> 02:01:10,790
I just want this.
I hope you drink it,

2829
02:01:11,520 --> 02:01:15,770
drink the shit out of this sometimes.
And this always happened to me when I,

2830
02:01:15,790 --> 02:01:17,090
you know,
I'd get a special coffee,

2831
02:01:17,091 --> 02:01:20,570
I give it to my parents and they'd throw
it in the freezer and save it for a

2832
02:01:20,571 --> 02:01:22,370
special occasion because they're like,
well,

2833
02:01:22,371 --> 02:01:23,980
none of this special coffee,
you know.

2834
02:01:24,010 --> 02:01:24,351
No,
no,

2835
02:01:24,351 --> 02:01:25,430
no,
we're drinking this all day.

2836
02:01:26,090 --> 02:01:28,370
I'm going to put that out in the kitchen
too.

2837
02:01:28,371 --> 02:01:30,160
I'm not going to put in the freezer.
I don't have to register.

2838
02:01:30,180 --> 02:01:31,013
I drink,
drink,

2839
02:01:31,070 --> 02:01:32,150
drink it quickly.
All right,

2840
02:01:32,151 --> 02:01:35,930
so we're going to leave this out and
we're going to report on this and thank

2841
02:01:35,931 --> 02:01:39,590
you for coming by and thank you to
wrecking ball coffee for making this

2842
02:01:39,591 --> 02:01:43,610
awesome ethiopian years.
It was a pleasure talking to you.

2843
02:01:43,611 --> 02:01:44,930
Um,
is there anything else we can cover?

2844
02:01:44,931 --> 02:01:49,730
Anything that people a don't know about
coffee that should know anything else

2845
02:01:49,760 --> 02:01:52,790
while we're gearing up somebody that was
looking at the twitter feed and somebody

2846
02:01:52,880 --> 02:01:54,110
mentioned something.
Oh,

2847
02:01:54,111 --> 02:01:55,960
okay.
I've got a few things that you're,

2848
02:01:56,130 --> 02:01:57,720
that people might be interested.
You ready to

2849
02:01:59,690 --> 02:02:00,620
catch it?
Coffee.

2850
02:02:00,800 --> 02:02:03,370
Oh,
I've had that kopi luwak.

2851
02:02:03,520 --> 02:02:04,410
Yeah.
Yeah,

2852
02:02:04,520 --> 02:02:06,960
but that's made by a civet they eat,
right?

2853
02:02:07,950 --> 02:02:08,631
Yeah,
I've had it.

2854
02:02:08,631 --> 02:02:10,030
I've ordered it.
Interesting.

2855
02:02:10,640 --> 02:02:15,020
Folks who don't know really is shit out
by this cat thing.

2856
02:02:15,021 --> 02:02:17,910
Right.
It's like it's in the cat family that.

2857
02:02:17,960 --> 02:02:18,730
Well,
yeah,

2858
02:02:18,730 --> 02:02:20,900
I think it's more like a raccoon.
Yeah.

2859
02:02:20,901 --> 02:02:23,780
And then eats the beans and then ships
them out and then they take it out of

2860
02:02:23,781 --> 02:02:27,020
its poop and when it goes through its
digestive tract,

2861
02:02:27,050 --> 02:02:29,810
it imparts a very mellow taste to the
coffee.

2862
02:02:30,070 --> 02:02:32,360
So it got in this movie,
you know the bucket list,

2863
02:02:32,361 --> 02:02:33,310
everybody.
What movies?

2864
02:02:33,560 --> 02:02:35,330
The bucket.
There's a movie called the bucket list.

2865
02:02:35,750 --> 02:02:38,600
Jack nicholson.
And you don't remember this,

2866
02:02:38,601 --> 02:02:38,900
but.
No,

2867
02:02:38,900 --> 02:02:40,910
I never heard of it.
It's about some old guys and they had a

2868
02:02:40,911 --> 02:02:43,160
bucket list of things to have things to
do before they died.

2869
02:02:43,161 --> 02:02:47,750
And one of the things was they drink the
coffee and so that of course it started

2870
02:02:47,751 --> 02:02:51,260
a rash of people asking people like me
about this,

2871
02:02:51,560 --> 02:02:52,850
this,
this.

2872
02:02:52,850 --> 02:02:54,560
Here's the animal.
Look at that cute little thing.

2873
02:02:55,400 --> 02:02:56,211
Well,
that's fake,

2874
02:02:56,211 --> 02:02:57,740
man.
He's not really talking.

2875
02:02:58,520 --> 02:03:00,170
Oh,
that's the beans that he pooped out.

2876
02:03:00,410 --> 02:03:04,550
I first tried that with my friend tate,
who's one of the owners of caveman

2877
02:03:04,551 --> 02:03:05,870
coffee.
Tate's always been a,

2878
02:03:05,871 --> 02:03:07,820
a,
a crazy coffee kind of sore.

2879
02:03:07,830 --> 02:03:11,150
But we were in miami and we saw this
caveman coffee by the way.

2880
02:03:11,390 --> 02:03:12,650
Uh,
he's out of New Mexico.

2881
02:03:12,651 --> 02:03:13,250
Okay,
cool.

2882
02:03:13,250 --> 02:03:17,990
I'm in this place in miami was some sort
of a specialty coffee joint.

2883
02:03:18,140 --> 02:03:22,130
There was a restaurant that had these
really expensive coffees and I forget

2884
02:03:22,131 --> 02:03:25,090
what it was like 30 bucks a glass a cup
or somethIng really expensive.

2885
02:03:25,100 --> 02:03:27,470
Something really nutty because it came
out of this cats.

2886
02:03:27,500 --> 02:03:32,300
But yeah,
and the problem is that it's really rare

2887
02:03:32,301 --> 02:03:35,060
and that's why it's expensive.
It's good though.

2888
02:03:35,061 --> 02:03:36,260
I've had it.
It's delicious.

2889
02:03:36,261 --> 02:03:37,160
I'm glad.
Yeah,

2890
02:03:37,161 --> 02:03:37,994
I'm glad you.

2891
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
Okay.
There can be a.

2892
02:03:40,130 --> 02:03:42,590
There can be some pretty rotten of this.
wait a minute.

2893
02:03:42,591 --> 02:03:45,400
It comes out of cats assets rotten.
how weird

2894
02:03:47,080 --> 02:03:50,180
it is.
There are these places where they have

2895
02:03:50,181 --> 02:03:52,780
the cats in cages in it a fuck.
You know what I mean?

2896
02:03:52,781 --> 02:03:54,140
And we think of that.
You got me now.

2897
02:03:54,170 --> 02:03:55,120
God damn it.
I'm sorry.

2898
02:03:55,130 --> 02:03:55,960
I'm not trying to.
Yeah,

2899
02:03:55,960 --> 02:03:58,640
you're black fish.
My kopi luwak was black fleece.

2900
02:03:58,690 --> 02:04:01,810
Black fish is that new documentary
that's killing seaworld,

2901
02:04:01,820 --> 02:04:03,320
right?
Because people got a chance to see what

2902
02:04:03,321 --> 02:04:04,154
it's really.
Right.

2903
02:04:04,880 --> 02:04:07,480
Fucking seaworld Is terrible.
It's terrible there.

2904
02:04:07,500 --> 02:04:10,640
Their slave colonies,
they're enslaving intelligent beings

2905
02:04:10,641 --> 02:04:11,810
that we can understand.
It's true.

2906
02:04:11,900 --> 02:04:13,340
It is.
It is 100 percent and,

2907
02:04:13,460 --> 02:04:14,600
and uh,
yeah,

2908
02:04:14,630 --> 02:04:17,600
so I,
I got a touch of that same sadness when

2909
02:04:17,601 --> 02:04:20,900
I saw that,
when I saw that and I've been to the

2910
02:04:20,930 --> 02:04:25,430
places where they do this,
imagining it just stands to reason.

2911
02:04:25,431 --> 02:04:27,960
if you have a product like this that's
very expensive,

2912
02:04:27,980 --> 02:04:29,580
then you're going to have these fucking
animals.

2913
02:04:29,581 --> 02:04:32,420
do you get a lot of fraud because it's
so expensive,

2914
02:04:32,590 --> 02:04:34,250
you know,
I would imagine so.

2915
02:04:34,310 --> 02:04:34,850
And,
and,

2916
02:04:34,850 --> 02:04:35,630
but,
you know,

2917
02:04:35,630 --> 02:04:38,340
I mean the amount of pleasure that you
can get from a coffee,

2918
02:04:38,340 --> 02:04:41,850
like the one I brought you or some of
these other ones that you've mentioned.

2919
02:04:42,360 --> 02:04:43,470
Um,
you know,

2920
02:04:44,160 --> 02:04:48,540
it's not solely necessarily to go to
that extent.

2921
02:04:48,870 --> 02:04:50,370
The other thing I noticed on the twitter
feed,

2922
02:04:50,371 --> 02:04:52,560
somebody mentioned coffee going extinct.
There was a news,

2923
02:04:52,760 --> 02:04:54,030
uh,
about a year ago,

2924
02:04:54,031 --> 02:04:57,360
there was a news thIng that was talking
about coffee going extinct.

2925
02:04:57,800 --> 02:04:59,190
Um,
and,

2926
02:04:59,310 --> 02:05:02,430
and uh,
and it's because,

2927
02:05:02,820 --> 02:05:05,850
so that this is tied into this,
uh,

2928
02:05:06,810 --> 02:05:08,940
this Ethiopia thing.
Um,

2929
02:05:08,941 --> 02:05:09,840
the fact that,
you know,

2930
02:05:09,841 --> 02:05:12,660
98,
99 percent of the total genetic

2931
02:05:12,661 --> 02:05:16,710
diversity of coffee is in Ethiopia.
And not only in in the country,

2932
02:05:16,980 --> 02:05:19,560
but in one.
There you go,

2933
02:05:19,561 --> 02:05:22,140
you're,
you're fast on the um,

2934
02:05:22,500 --> 02:05:24,660
it's not even Ethiopia,
all,

2935
02:05:24,661 --> 02:05:28,890
it's the south west part of Ethiopia
where coffee is indigenous to

2936
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:30,860
pull an image of the beans itself like
that,

2937
02:05:30,890 --> 02:05:33,440
like that.
Like you gotta get a blow up on one of

2938
02:05:33,441 --> 02:05:35,630
those because most people don't even
know what coffee beans look like.

2939
02:05:36,010 --> 02:05:38,300
So those are,
we call them coffee cherries for obvious

2940
02:05:38,301 --> 02:05:39,081
reasons.
Yeah,

2941
02:05:39,081 --> 02:05:42,140
I mean they look like a fruit.
It's so interesting because we think of

2942
02:05:42,141 --> 02:05:43,430
coffee as,
you know,

2943
02:05:43,431 --> 02:05:45,350
if you,
if you're crazy,

2944
02:05:45,351 --> 02:05:46,900
you grind your own stuff,
right?

2945
02:05:47,030 --> 02:05:50,360
That's how most people think.
But it's already cooked and roasted and

2946
02:05:50,420 --> 02:05:51,770
yeah,
we think of it as food

2947
02:05:52,340 --> 02:05:53,300
in coffee,
you know,

2948
02:05:53,301 --> 02:05:56,190
and you know,
uh,

2949
02:05:56,750 --> 02:05:59,700
one of the biggest things that we can do
for people that is,

2950
02:05:59,840 --> 02:06:01,970
yeah,
it's beautiful grapes.

2951
02:06:02,060 --> 02:06:04,760
Get people to understand that coffee is
the seed of a fruit.

2952
02:06:04,930 --> 02:06:07,150
I need to get some of that coffee.
Fruit I want to eat,

2953
02:06:08,530 --> 02:06:12,640
but you'd have to send me the dry stuff.
Where can I go and actually buy the

2954
02:06:12,641 --> 02:06:15,100
fruit and eat it?
Is there a place compete in san diego,

2955
02:06:15,130 --> 02:06:16,690
santa barbara,
California.

2956
02:06:16,691 --> 02:06:17,680
So that's right.
That's right.

2957
02:06:17,681 --> 02:06:19,360
That's right.
Five minutes away from here or

2958
02:06:19,361 --> 02:06:19,930
something.
Yeah.

2959
02:06:19,930 --> 02:06:22,510
I fucking love santa barbara.
I've actually thought about moving

2960
02:06:22,511 --> 02:06:23,160
there.
Oh,

2961
02:06:23,160 --> 02:06:24,490
I'm there.
So what am I there?

2962
02:06:25,120 --> 02:06:28,360
I think I'm there in april or something
should go visit.

2963
02:06:28,361 --> 02:06:29,910
jay's a great guy.
You go.

2964
02:06:30,340 --> 02:06:32,080
The fruit is delicious.
You eat fruit,

2965
02:06:32,081 --> 02:06:33,280
right?
I love fruit.

2966
02:06:33,281 --> 02:06:34,390
Yeah.
Then this is the.

2967
02:06:34,480 --> 02:06:36,610
This is the guy I'm there in santa
barbara.

2968
02:06:36,611 --> 02:06:37,810
May second.
Friday,

2969
02:06:37,811 --> 02:06:40,540
May 2nd.
I'm at the lobero theater with joey

2970
02:06:40,541 --> 02:06:41,321
diaz.
Yeah.

2971
02:06:41,321 --> 02:06:42,380
go check.
So I will do.

2972
02:06:42,381 --> 02:06:47,230
I will definitely go and check that out
because I want to go just to support

2973
02:06:47,231 --> 02:06:47,740
that guy.

2974
02:06:47,740 --> 02:06:49,480
I love when someone does something that
cool,

2975
02:06:49,810 --> 02:06:52,750
you know,
it takes a crazy project like that and

2976
02:06:53,270 --> 02:06:55,420
then seven years.
He's a cool guy for sure.

2977
02:06:56,110 --> 02:06:58,300
Well listen man,
this is really fascinating stuff.

2978
02:06:58,360 --> 02:07:00,510
I'm really interested in,
uh,

2979
02:07:00,610 --> 02:07:01,251
I really,
uh,

2980
02:07:01,251 --> 02:07:05,160
appreciate you coming on here and
educating us and giving us all the uh,

2981
02:07:05,440 --> 02:07:07,060
the low down on coffee.
I've been,

2982
02:07:07,061 --> 02:07:10,840
um,
been on a journey to kind of understand

2983
02:07:10,841 --> 02:07:13,420
and learn the process of this over the
last few months,

2984
02:07:13,750 --> 02:07:18,750
just really kind of digging deep into
the coffee flavor a barrel.

2985
02:07:18,941 --> 02:07:20,950
It's,
it's really been fascinating stuff and

2986
02:07:20,951 --> 02:07:25,870
very intriguing and stimulating in a,
in a lot of ways.

2987
02:07:25,871 --> 02:07:29,260
just the ideas behind it.
Like it's cool to uncover this whole

2988
02:07:29,261 --> 02:07:34,261
sort of community of people trying to
enhance flavors and tight taste them and

2989
02:07:36,010 --> 02:07:36,821
change.
I mean,

2990
02:07:36,821 --> 02:07:41,020
I had no idea there was a specialty
coffee association of America until just

2991
02:07:41,020 --> 02:07:41,560
a few days ago.
Yeah,

2992
02:07:41,560 --> 02:07:43,450
well,
I mean serious business and you want to

2993
02:07:43,480 --> 02:07:44,560
see a.org.

2994
02:07:44,670 --> 02:07:47,340
You want to hear a crazy thing you're
talking about like intellectual

2995
02:07:47,341 --> 02:07:49,720
connection and stuff like that.
Um,

2996
02:07:50,310 --> 02:07:53,790
so coffee was invented in Ethiopia as we
said in,

2997
02:07:53,820 --> 02:07:56,400
in Ethiopia.
They do it like a coffee ceremony,

2998
02:07:56,490 --> 02:07:57,360
like a,
you know,

2999
02:07:57,370 --> 02:07:59,520
it's a very ceremonial way to prepare it
and drink it.

3000
02:08:00,780 --> 02:08:03,240
And when they do the coffee ceremony,
they,

3001
02:08:03,270 --> 02:08:06,300
It's like they gather people together
from the village,

3002
02:08:06,301 --> 02:08:09,300
they and they talk about things.
They talk about the news of the village,

3003
02:08:09,301 --> 02:08:13,050
they talk about things that are going on
in the world.

3004
02:08:13,530 --> 02:08:16,380
When coffee moved from Ethiopia to
Yemen,

3005
02:08:16,950 --> 02:08:18,930
totally different deal.
Like in Ethiopia,

3006
02:08:18,931 --> 02:08:22,620
it's always a woman that makes coffee,
whereas in Yemen it wasn't like that,

3007
02:08:23,280 --> 02:08:26,790
but they still would talk about news and
intellectual and stuff like that.

3008
02:08:27,360 --> 02:08:30,380
Then coffee moved from Yemen to europe,
um,

3009
02:08:31,170 --> 02:08:34,440
you know,
Italy and england and places like that

3010
02:08:34,740 --> 02:08:39,740
and the coffee house still remained a
place for intellectual exchange and

3011
02:08:41,160 --> 02:08:44,460
discourse and stuff like that.
They planned the american revolution in

3012
02:08:44,461 --> 02:08:46,080
coffee houses,
you know,

3013
02:08:46,240 --> 02:08:47,073
in

3014
02:08:47,320 --> 02:08:48,153
we're wired,
right?

3015
02:08:48,210 --> 02:08:48,841
They're like,
fuck,

3016
02:08:48,841 --> 02:08:51,410
there's something about,
there's something about coffee that like

3017
02:08:51,480 --> 02:08:54,030
that,
like gets your mind going as well as

3018
02:08:54,450 --> 02:08:57,990
stimulates you and wakes you up.
But also the tea party movement like

3019
02:08:58,010 --> 02:09:00,930
that,
that had an effect on the way the United

3020
02:09:00,930 --> 02:09:04,950
States took off just by simply the fact
that they went from tea to coffee.

3021
02:09:04,951 --> 02:09:05,650
That's what the,
the,

3022
02:09:05,650 --> 02:09:07,530
there is.
There are people who speculate that

3023
02:09:07,560 --> 02:09:09,470
that's totally valid.
Yeah.

3024
02:09:09,610 --> 02:09:09,980
That,
that,

3025
02:09:09,980 --> 02:09:14,300
that coffee consumption is a part of the
american,

3026
02:09:14,560 --> 02:09:17,690
uh,
drive to ingenuity and imagination.

3027
02:09:17,750 --> 02:09:19,730
Ron's fucking speed.
We're country on speed.

3028
02:09:20,120 --> 02:09:23,060
I wonder if they could show gross
domestic product posts.

3029
02:09:23,061 --> 02:09:27,050
Starbucks.
Not starbucks impacted people's

3030
02:09:27,140 --> 02:09:28,610
productivity,
but still right.

3031
02:09:28,611 --> 02:09:29,110
If you go to

3032
02:09:29,110 --> 02:09:31,990
somebody at a coffee shop,
you're going to talk about something

3033
02:09:31,991 --> 02:09:36,070
that's different than going to drink
with somebody at a bar or have dinner

3034
02:09:36,071 --> 02:09:38,320
with somebody or something like that.
It's different.

3035
02:09:38,321 --> 02:09:39,950
It's somehow more about exchanging info

3036
02:09:40,020 --> 02:09:41,970
nation,
more imagination.

3037
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:46,710
It's stimulating.
The stimulant of caffeine in coffee is

3038
02:09:46,711 --> 02:09:49,260
stimulating and then the flavor is
enriching.

3039
02:09:49,261 --> 02:09:52,770
You enjoy the flavor and then you get
fucking happy and it's been that way

3040
02:09:52,771 --> 02:09:56,370
since the origin of coffee.
Coffee houses.

3041
02:09:56,610 --> 02:09:58,170
Yeah.
Coffeehouses were always thought of as

3042
02:09:58,171 --> 02:10:00,350
places where people read poetry and you
know.

3043
02:10:00,870 --> 02:10:02,610
Yeah.
And he politics,

3044
02:10:02,620 --> 02:10:05,100
etc. And as you said,
plan revolutions.

3045
02:10:05,101 --> 02:10:06,510
That's interesting to me.
Yeah,

3046
02:10:06,540 --> 02:10:08,840
it is interesting and that's one of the
reasons

3047
02:10:08,890 --> 02:10:12,640
that I think that I like to work in
coffee because I'm into that sort of

3048
02:10:12,641 --> 02:10:13,240
thing.
Anyway.

3049
02:10:13,240 --> 02:10:16,240
Intellectual engagement,
creativity,

3050
02:10:16,570 --> 02:10:17,560
you know,
music,

3051
02:10:17,620 --> 02:10:19,300
poetry,
politics,

3052
02:10:19,570 --> 02:10:20,530
these,
this,

3053
02:10:20,550 --> 02:10:22,810
this is always been like that.
It's like this.

3054
02:10:22,811 --> 02:10:25,390
And in asia,
in arabia,

3055
02:10:25,660 --> 02:10:26,940
everywhere the coffee goes to second.

3056
02:10:27,120 --> 02:10:32,120
Do you feel like coffee doesn't get
enough credit for the impact that it has

3057
02:10:32,671 --> 02:10:33,870
had culturally?
Yeah,

3058
02:10:33,871 --> 02:10:34,280
I think

3059
02:10:34,280 --> 02:10:37,650
I,
I do think sometimes it bums me out this

3060
02:10:37,710 --> 02:10:42,300
idea of like cheap people want cheap,
abundant coffee,

3061
02:10:42,320 --> 02:10:46,200
but it's just,
it's only function is as a drug to get

3062
02:10:46,201 --> 02:10:47,910
them to work in the morning,
you know,

3063
02:10:47,911 --> 02:10:50,390
and it's been cheapened by our culture.
Um,

3064
02:10:50,550 --> 02:10:54,460
but,
but It's it special and,

3065
02:10:54,600 --> 02:10:56,970
and it could go away,
you know,

3066
02:10:57,120 --> 02:10:58,290
really well.
Yeah.

3067
02:10:58,291 --> 02:11:00,930
So that,
this whole extinction thing is about,

3068
02:11:01,100 --> 02:11:04,790
about how we're 98 percent of this,
this,

3069
02:11:05,580 --> 02:11:08,220
the origin of coffee is because of
climate change.

3070
02:11:08,790 --> 02:11:13,710
The scientist who does this work is done
the projections and if and if the

3071
02:11:13,740 --> 02:11:17,790
weather there as predicted increases by
a few degrees,

3072
02:11:18,600 --> 02:11:23,550
then the coffee won't be able to survive
and it could be 80 percent wiped out in

3073
02:11:23,551 --> 02:11:25,890
these natural coffee forests in 50
years.

3074
02:11:26,070 --> 02:11:26,903
Whoa.

3075
02:11:27,410 --> 02:11:32,270
And then then we'll be up a creek
because the motherload of genetic origin

3076
02:11:32,360 --> 02:11:37,040
of coffee will be gone essentially.

3077
02:11:37,770 --> 02:11:40,260
That's intense.
And then can there be steps done too,

3078
02:11:40,520 --> 02:11:42,440
guard that we're trying to do that in
the industry.

3079
02:11:42,441 --> 02:11:46,190
So we had actually at a conference about
a year ago on this very question where

3080
02:11:46,191 --> 02:11:49,670
we talked about preservation of the
genetic diversity of coffee,

3081
02:11:49,910 --> 02:11:52,040
which means taking coffee out of
Ethiopia,

3082
02:11:52,041 --> 02:11:55,640
planting it elsewhere to make sure that
we've got other examples of the same,

3083
02:11:55,970 --> 02:11:58,730
of the genetic diversity,
diversity in other parts of the world.

3084
02:11:59,330 --> 02:12:00,163
um,
you know,

3085
02:12:00,260 --> 02:12:04,190
preserving it.
There's other ways to preserve a coffee,

3086
02:12:04,250 --> 02:12:06,320
you know,
by freezing the seeds,

3087
02:12:06,640 --> 02:12:08,000
you know,
and putting them in storage.

3088
02:12:08,001 --> 02:12:09,500
So if we need them,
we can go back to them.

3089
02:12:10,210 --> 02:12:12,190
This has been an eyeopening podcast,
man.

3090
02:12:12,220 --> 02:12:17,080
I learned more about coffee today than I
had in 46 years of life on this planet.

3091
02:12:17,560 --> 02:12:18,480
Thank you peter.
I really,

3092
02:12:18,490 --> 02:12:22,150

And again see a.org.
Thank you very much.

And thanks also to our sponsors.
Thanks to um,

3106
02:13:13,780 --> 02:13:18,780
tends to naturebox naturebox.
Go to naturebox.com and use the.

3107
02:13:20,200 --> 02:13:21,970
Hold on.
I'm sorry I lost my place.

3108
02:13:23,330 --> 02:13:26,590
Naturebox fuckers.
You're awesome.

3109
02:13:26,591 --> 02:13:27,424
Delicious.
Shit.

3110
02:13:27,720 --> 02:13:30,100
You confuse the shit out of me.
It's code name.

3111
02:13:30,101 --> 02:13:30,934
Rogan,
I believe.

3112
02:13:31,260 --> 02:13:32,160
Oh,
we don't

3113
02:13:32,190 --> 02:13:34,890
need to believe we need to know.
So give me a second here.

3114
02:13:35,240 --> 02:13:36,450
A naturebox.
Yeah,

3115
02:13:36,451 --> 02:13:41,400
here we go.
Yes it is naturebox.com/rogan.

3116
02:13:41,430 --> 02:13:44,400
It's not a code word.
So naturebox.com/rogan.

3117
02:13:44,430 --> 02:13:46,920
That's why we looked it up.
Otherwise we confused the fuck out of

3118
02:13:46,921 --> 02:13:48,540
people.
So good at naturebox.

3119
02:13:48,541 --> 02:13:51,750
Dot com slash rogan.
Try naturebox and get 50 slash 50

3120
02:13:51,751 --> 02:13:55,830
percent off your first box.
That's naturebox.com.

3121
02:13:55,831 --> 02:13:58,140
Slash rogan,
very delicious stuff and as I said

3122
02:13:58,141 --> 02:14:00,440
before,
a lot of variables and as far as like

3123
02:14:00,450 --> 02:14:03,240
what you can order,
you can go super healthy and go medium

3124
02:14:03,241 --> 02:14:04,470
healthy.
You can go pretzels,

3125
02:14:04,800 --> 02:14:06,390
but a really good,
