1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,650
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:01,950
Oh,

3
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:03,150
I still feel a big,

4
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,450
big difference from these and
the clinical trial that we did,

5
00:00:06,451 --> 00:00:07,950
the double blind that was with this,

6
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:09,180
this particular formula,

7
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:12,990
but I still think that we should release
a fucking hyper version for people are

8
00:00:12,991 --> 00:00:13,590
savages.

9
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:13,701
Oh,

10
00:00:13,701 --> 00:00:14,550
you want to get crazy?

11
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,370
Even if you don't want her
own calling crossbones on it.

12
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:18,720
If we can't release it,

13
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:19,760
can I at least get some

14
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:22,993
combination?

15
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:24,953
We can get you something.

16
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:25,261
Well,

17
00:00:25,261 --> 00:00:28,140
I think this is just the beginning
of this sort of science of a,

18
00:00:28,141 --> 00:00:31,740
of nootropics and they're coming up with
all sorts of different combinations.

19
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:33,230
These things Paratha town.

20
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:34,780
I want that stuff to be like in Olean.

21
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:35,491
Oh,

22
00:00:35,491 --> 00:00:36,890
that shit limitless.

23
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:37,980
I love that movie,

24
00:00:37,981 --> 00:00:38,814
man.

25
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,220
That's America in a nutshell.

26
00:00:41,221 --> 00:00:44,150
Everybody's wants to be a lazy fuck
that you take a pill and then set your

27
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,293
suits.

28
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,553
Gotta work for it though.

29
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,710
Isn't it funny though how many God damn
movies there are about a dumb person all

30
00:00:49,711 --> 00:00:52,350
sudden become super smart and
figures the whole fucking world out?

31
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:52,820
Yeah,

32
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,480
like John Travolta when
you got hit by lightning.

33
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:55,990
That's right.

34
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:58,230
All the sudden these fucking
learning Portuguese and shit.

35
00:00:59,060 --> 00:00:59,820
Yeah,

36
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:00,560
that was a good one.

37
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,000
[inaudible] was outside with the polar
turning gets struck by lightning and

38
00:01:03,001 --> 00:01:03,211
stuff.

39
00:01:03,211 --> 00:01:04,044
So like it'd be smarter.

40
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:04,231
Well,

41
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:07,380
you know what does work with
some things like people have,

42
00:01:07,381 --> 00:01:12,381
like I have a friend and her son got in
a motorcycle accident and then he got a

43
00:01:13,231 --> 00:01:16,950
head injury and became super
artistic after the motorcycle injury.

44
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:18,060
Yeah.

45
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,260
So we do need to get hit in the head.

46
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:23,070
Well [inaudible] science,

47
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,113
that's the problem.

48
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,980
Sam Kinison got hit and they had a,

49
00:01:25,981 --> 00:01:26,880
when he was a kid too,

50
00:01:26,881 --> 00:01:27,840
he got hit by a truck.

51
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:28,021
Oh,

52
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:28,770
I heard about this.

53
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:29,220
Yeah.

54
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,810
And it fucking switch.

55
00:01:30,811 --> 00:01:31,740
You'd be like a normal,

56
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:32,371
calm,

57
00:01:32,371 --> 00:01:33,210
shy kid.

58
00:01:33,211 --> 00:01:34,560
And then he got hit by a truck and Sinai.

59
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:37,710
He became this fucking wild,

60
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:38,780
impulsive maniac.

61
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:39,743
That's crazy.

62
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:40,701
Honestly.

63
00:01:40,701 --> 00:01:41,240
Yeah.

64
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,050
What head injuries are just very strange.

65
00:01:43,051 --> 00:01:43,711
It's very strange.

66
00:01:43,711 --> 00:01:44,850
The reactions that a,

67
00:01:44,851 --> 00:01:46,230
that had her injuries have,

68
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:46,801
you know,

69
00:01:46,801 --> 00:01:49,740
people have had car accidents
and then become gay.

70
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,000
Oh Wow.

71
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,510
Yeah.

72
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:52,343
Really no way.

73
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,353
I might have.

74
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,140
I might have made that at all.

75
00:01:56,141 --> 00:01:56,580
No,

76
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,060
I did.

77
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:57,721
Hold on a second.

78
00:01:57,721 --> 00:01:59,320
The head trauma turns it up.

79
00:01:59,460 --> 00:01:59,761
No,

80
00:01:59,761 --> 00:02:00,480
I don't think so.

81
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,350
Some guy who was,

82
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:03,210
who was gay and just
use that as an excuse.

83
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,493
That's fine.

84
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:06,480
I'm not judging it.

85
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:11,310
Rugby player wakes up gay after a stroke.

86
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:11,940
Wow.

87
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,920
He had a stroke and then
he woke up and he was gay.

88
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:17,640
Someone took care of him when he was
barely rugby player has a stroke after

89
00:02:17,641 --> 00:02:18,241
freak gym,

90
00:02:18,241 --> 00:02:21,000
accident up gay and becomes a hairdresser.

91
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,330
That's just as exciting to me.

92
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:22,681
Whatever.

93
00:02:22,681 --> 00:02:23,400
I mean he's gained again.

94
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:23,701
It's cool.

95
00:02:23,701 --> 00:02:24,001
Whatever.

96
00:02:24,001 --> 00:02:26,900
You know this is actually
earlier but so does not look

97
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,500
like a rugby player either.

98
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:33,750
But I mean he doesn't even make up an
excuse of getting hit in the head to be

99
00:02:33,751 --> 00:02:35,300
game and just whoever your gates.

100
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,253
Okay.

101
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,350
You don't know.

102
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,140
Maybe really did have a
stroke and woke up gay,

103
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,810
but he used to look like straight as fuck.

104
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:46,653
He looked straight.

105
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:46,831
Well,

106
00:02:46,831 --> 00:02:47,011
you know,

107
00:02:47,011 --> 00:02:47,700
there was um,

108
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,750
there was a drug called reequip that uh,

109
00:02:50,751 --> 00:02:53,190
an Irish man won a settlement of,

110
00:02:53,191 --> 00:02:58,191
I believe it was like 600,000 US dollars
because this drug turned him gay.

111
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,950
And into a addict.

112
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,260
She was having unsafe sex and he was,

113
00:03:02,261 --> 00:03:02,770
uh,

114
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:07,770
he was going like meeting people online
and getting fucking crazy with dudes and

115
00:03:07,961 --> 00:03:08,130
do it.

116
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:08,771
A bunch of gay shit.

117
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:09,610
And he was a family man.

118
00:03:09,611 --> 00:03:09,941
Married.

119
00:03:09,941 --> 00:03:10,720
Got One.

120
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,230
He Won.

121
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,160
How do you prove that?

122
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,020
That's a very good question.

123
00:03:14,021 --> 00:03:14,351
Tj.

124
00:03:14,351 --> 00:03:15,184
Dillashaw yeah.

125
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:17,650
I like how you think fucking know,

126
00:03:17,651 --> 00:03:18,250
man.

127
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,720
But not only did they prove it,

128
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:20,141
I mean,

129
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:24,160
this was against Glaxo
Klein to Glaxo Klein Smith,

130
00:03:24,161 --> 00:03:25,350
the big pharmaceutical companies.

131
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,980
They're the ones who lost.

132
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:29,950
So it was their lawyers lost this case.

133
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,110
It was so much evidence here,

134
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:32,830
I'll pull it up.

135
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,750
Re-Equip this.

136
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:36,820
There must be so much fucking evidence.

137
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:37,683
Turns a man Gai.

138
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,093
Wow.

139
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:40,690
That is crazy.

140
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:44,350
There's so much evidence that they
actually had to give him money,

141
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,550
which was an amazing,

142
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,181
yeah,

143
00:03:46,181 --> 00:03:48,550
you want 160,000 pounds,

144
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:52,000
which is roughly somewhere around,

145
00:03:52,001 --> 00:03:52,650
what's the,

146
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,100
that weird looking thing?

147
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:54,934
It's not a pound.

148
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:55,670
I have no,

149
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:56,503
the one shore.

150
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,473
I think so.

151
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,373
Um,

152
00:03:58,990 --> 00:03:59,650
anyway,

153
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:00,201
whatever the,

154
00:04:00,201 --> 00:04:00,461
the,

155
00:04:00,461 --> 00:04:01,390
the amount this was,

156
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:01,830
it was a lot of,

157
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,600
even if it was $160,000,

158
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:04,300
way too much.

159
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,070
He doesn't care if it's 160 bucks,

160
00:04:06,071 --> 00:04:07,120
he shouldn't get paid for them.

161
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,380
Somebody's got,

162
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,620
somebody's got the manipulators.

163
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:09,791
Well,

164
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:14,560
he had Parkinson's and so this was a
Parkinson's medication and it turned him

165
00:04:14,561 --> 00:04:16,690
into a gay sex and gambling addict.

166
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:21,190
Amazing impulsive control systems.

167
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,620
And this is where it gets really weird,

168
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,810
including compulsive behaviors.

169
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,550
There have been reports of patients
experiencing intense urges to gamble,

170
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:35,500
increased sexual urges and other intense
urges and the inability to control

171
00:04:35,501 --> 00:04:40,450
those urges while taking one or more of
the medications that increase central

172
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:41,110
dope.

173
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:41,531
Dope.

174
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:42,940
It dope.

175
00:04:42,941 --> 00:04:44,440
Amid Magenta,

176
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,430

JIC dopaminergic Dopa magick menergy
tones that are generally used for the

178
00:04:51,401 --> 00:04:52,660
treatment of Parkinson's disease.

179
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:57,040
So this is an restless leg syndrome or
when you see when dudes like can't stop

180
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:57,800
moving their legs.

181
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,560
It's my parking guy.

182
00:04:59,561 --> 00:05:00,730
Does he have any daughters?

183
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:04,443
Is that a job?

184
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,250
Should have worked on that
one a little bit more for you.

185
00:05:06,251 --> 00:05:07,570
Let it loose skin sons.

186
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:09,490
He had Parkinson's.

187
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:09,761
Oh,

188
00:05:09,761 --> 00:05:10,630
you're so retarded.

189
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:11,660
It doesn't work.

190
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,770
He can't keep trying.

191
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,141
He's like,

192
00:05:14,141 --> 00:05:15,160
come on guys.

193
00:05:15,161 --> 00:05:17,370
Parking son wears his daughters.

194
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,610
When I get it,

195
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:20,230
they lot to fuck.

196
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,040
I thought it was funny,

197
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,470
but I think you missed it.

198
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:24,010
Please don't encourage him.

199
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:25,270
We both had it.

200
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,103
There was nothing there.

201
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:27,303
The um,

202
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:28,600
the idea that a,

203
00:05:28,601 --> 00:05:31,330
that a drug could do that too
though is pretty fucking shocking,

204
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,090
is the drug that turns you into acting
like a lot of other people in the world.

205
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:34,331
Well,

206
00:05:34,331 --> 00:05:35,980
not just acting like a lot
of the people in the world,

207
00:05:35,981 --> 00:05:36,810
but you were a normal guy,

208
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:39,970
was a control of your urges and then all
of a sudden you're just flying off the

209
00:05:39,971 --> 00:05:41,830
handle meet and dudes online.

210
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:42,880
They're just,

211
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,180
there you go,

212
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:43,421
Brian.

213
00:05:43,421 --> 00:05:44,860
We should do that as a test.

214
00:05:44,861 --> 00:05:46,000
Just get you on this shit.

215
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:46,863
I would love to try it.

216
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:48,480
He would totally do it.

217
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,840
He'd be the best Guinea pig.

218
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:55,660
Give him a monthly budget and
a videographer and a nice,

219
00:05:55,661 --> 00:05:56,590
it would be a delight Dick.

220
00:05:56,591 --> 00:05:57,370
It'd be,

221
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:00,440
that's thing in the rural if you just
craved it instead of having to do with all

222
00:06:00,441 --> 00:06:01,340
this nonsense.

223
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,263
That's what I'm saying.

224
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,313
Back at the gym,

225
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,263
dammit.

226
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:04,730
I mean,

227
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:05,120
look,

228
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,030
everybody wants to say there's
something wrong with being gay,

229
00:06:08,031 --> 00:06:09,680
but you live and you die.

230
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,910
And if you're straight,

231
00:06:10,911 --> 00:06:11,870
you look at gang go,

232
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:12,081
oh,

233
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:12,681
I don't want that.

234
00:06:12,681 --> 00:06:13,191
But guess what?

235
00:06:13,191 --> 00:06:13,761
If you're straight,

236
00:06:13,761 --> 00:06:14,200
you look at,

237
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:14,490
you know,

238
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:15,021
if you're gay,

239
00:06:15,021 --> 00:06:16,160
rather you look at straight and go,

240
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,013
I don't want that.

241
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:19,010
What you like is what you like.

242
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,180
And if you like gay,

243
00:06:20,181 --> 00:06:21,440
it would be awesome to be gay.

244
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:23,480
There's spots.

245
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:26,570
I had doctors and had to go do my
physicals and stuff for the fight and they

246
00:06:26,571 --> 00:06:26,721
say,

247
00:06:26,721 --> 00:06:27,560
why are you fighting?

248
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:27,711
Like,

249
00:06:27,711 --> 00:06:28,580
why are you doing this?

250
00:06:28,581 --> 00:06:29,414
Like fuck man,

251
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:29,961
I don't know.

252
00:06:29,961 --> 00:06:30,794
But it's fun.

253
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,753
Yeah.

254
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,980
I rent my levels of testosterone,

255
00:06:33,981 --> 00:06:34,730
I think,

256
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:34,851
well,

257
00:06:34,851 --> 00:06:36,500
if you go down to Santa Monica Boulevard,

258
00:06:36,501 --> 00:06:37,340
if you're a gay guy,

259
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:38,990
there's like a one stop shop.

260
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:39,800
You just,

261
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,250
you just take your shirt off and just
walk to the crowd and to just start

262
00:06:43,251 --> 00:06:43,521
blowing.

263
00:06:43,521 --> 00:06:44,354
You mean?

264
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,590
That's what I hear.

265
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:51,170
That's what I hear very different
because it's all Yang because Yang Yang,

266
00:06:51,171 --> 00:06:51,411
Yang,

267
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:51,681
Yang,

268
00:06:51,681 --> 00:06:51,951
Yang.

269
00:06:51,951 --> 00:06:53,540
There's no Yin's like there's no like,

270
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:53,871
oh,

271
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:54,471
I don't know.

272
00:06:54,471 --> 00:06:55,580
You just want to use me.

273
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:56,450
None of that.

274
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:57,261
They're using each other.

275
00:06:57,261 --> 00:06:59,300
They just fucking blasting each other.

276
00:06:59,301 --> 00:07:00,230
They're having a great time.

277
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:01,640
They understand each other.

278
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,600
There's no confusion.

279
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,900
There's no navigate.

280
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:09,980
Navigating relationship with a woman
is like putting rubber gloves on in the

281
00:07:09,981 --> 00:07:14,120
dark and putting your hands into one of
those incubation tubes and try to do a

282
00:07:14,121 --> 00:07:14,840
Rubik's cube.

283
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,673
Like what?

284
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,281
I can't see.

285
00:07:16,281 --> 00:07:17,330
What's Fuck's going on here?

286
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:20,360
You have to like take their
word for what is happening here.

287
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:20,541
Oh,

288
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:22,520
you're upset that I went
out with my friends.

289
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:22,920
Oh,

290
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,241
okay.

291
00:07:23,241 --> 00:07:23,691
I guess.

292
00:07:23,691 --> 00:07:25,490
No more friends and you my friend.

293
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:26,360
How are you?

294
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,193
What's going on here?

295
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,213
That's you.

296
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,270
We don't know how they think.

297
00:07:29,271 --> 00:07:30,710
I think I got a good Rubik's cube.

298
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:31,330
Yeah.

299
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:31,710
I was like,

300
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:32,310
dude,

301
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,060
you got a good one.

302
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:33,690
That's the key.

303
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:35,060
Get a Rubik's cube that
you can figure out.

304
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:36,571
But dudes,

305
00:07:36,571 --> 00:07:37,221
no one dudes,

306
00:07:37,221 --> 00:07:37,610
they're like,

307
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:37,821
Oh,

308
00:07:37,821 --> 00:07:39,580
you like Dick guy like pod

309
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:42,201
fucking.

310
00:07:42,201 --> 00:07:43,640
They know what's going on.

311
00:07:43,641 --> 00:07:44,300
I was like,

312
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,350
we both like each other.

313
00:07:45,351 --> 00:07:46,184
They Bang it out.

314
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:47,990
It seems more easy.

315
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,490
You were offered this drug.

316
00:07:49,491 --> 00:07:50,211
If you weren't married,

317
00:07:50,211 --> 00:07:51,044
would you try it?

318
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:51,531
You know,

319
00:07:51,531 --> 00:07:56,531
I'd have to be committed because women
can dance back and forth from the world

320
00:07:56,751 --> 00:08:00,470
of gay and straight with
an effortless finesse.

321
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:01,580
They can,

322
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,230
they can easily go back and forth.

323
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:03,711
Not only that,

324
00:08:03,711 --> 00:08:04,790
it makes them more attractive.

325
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:05,630
They can say things like,

326
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,910
[inaudible] like to talk about this,

327
00:08:07,911 --> 00:08:10,190
but I was gay for like a year,

328
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,020
shut up for a year.

329
00:08:12,021 --> 00:08:14,180
I had a girlfriend and you know,

330
00:08:14,181 --> 00:08:14,451
I just,

331
00:08:14,451 --> 00:08:14,811
just like,

332
00:08:14,811 --> 00:08:15,591
men are assholes,

333
00:08:15,591 --> 00:08:16,041
I'm done.

334
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:16,671
And you're like,

335
00:08:16,671 --> 00:08:21,671
your dick is like just a raging
feel missile than your parents

336
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:28,070
where she tell her to come stay with us.

337
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,093
You know?

338
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,400
That's the first thought
in every guy for sure.

339
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:32,370
For sure.

340
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:32,740
She's like,

341
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:33,261
it's okay.

342
00:08:33,261 --> 00:08:34,094
It doesn't even bother me.

343
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:36,500
If you came home and you find
your girlfriend eating pussy,

344
00:08:36,501 --> 00:08:37,101
you wouldn't be like,

345
00:08:37,101 --> 00:08:37,940
what the fuck?

346
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:39,441
You'd be like,

347
00:08:39,441 --> 00:08:39,681
oh,

348
00:08:39,681 --> 00:08:40,514
what's going on here?

349
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,700
Just take your clothes off
and come in the room like,

350
00:08:43,701 --> 00:08:44,534
hey,

351
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:45,980
as long as the girls,

352
00:08:45,981 --> 00:08:49,180
the girlfriend is not like all
jealous and fucking plotty,

353
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,253
Jamie,

354
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,790
you better keep it away from me.

355
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:53,550
Oh God.

356
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,770
Someone's ruin the party

357
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,810
as long as she's friendly too.

358
00:08:58,830 --> 00:08:59,663
Oh boy.

359
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:03,150
But if a girl comes home and
her boyfriend is stuck in a car,

360
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,043
that's a bummer.

361
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,410
You come home and your boyfriend is blown.

362
00:09:06,411 --> 00:09:09,180
The plumber that is a
fucking straight bummer,

363
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:10,523
you know?

364
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:12,240
But if you came home and like,

365
00:09:12,241 --> 00:09:12,511
you know,

366
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:16,320
your wife had went to fucking lunch with
some chick was in aerobics class and

367
00:09:16,321 --> 00:09:18,090
they're eating each other out
when you walked through the door.

368
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:19,950
It's really not that big of a deal.

369
00:09:19,951 --> 00:09:21,450
It's a little surprising.

370
00:09:21,451 --> 00:09:21,691
Like,

371
00:09:21,691 --> 00:09:22,291
Whoa,

372
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:23,220
this is crazy.

373
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,600
Yeah.

374
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,200
The act of two male sex
is a very different act.

375
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:29,400
It's very,

376
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,330
so no,

377
00:09:30,331 --> 00:09:31,380
I wouldn't take that pill

378
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,170
to answer your question.

379
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:35,803
Yeah.

380
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:37,861
Would you take it?

381
00:09:37,861 --> 00:09:38,700
You think you would take it?

382
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:39,001
No,

383
00:09:39,001 --> 00:09:39,300
no,

384
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:39,870
no.

385
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:40,170
It's pretty,

386
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:41,003
girls are better.

387
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:41,761
They're pretty,

388
00:09:41,761 --> 00:09:42,840
or they smell better.

389
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,790
Would be interesting to try it though.

390
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:47,310
If there was a a a serum,

391
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:48,001
you know what I mean?

392
00:09:48,001 --> 00:09:48,834
Like,

393
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:49,680
oh my God,

394
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,161
I liked Dick.

395
00:09:50,161 --> 00:09:50,750
That's so weird.

396
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:50,971
All right,

397
00:09:50,971 --> 00:09:51,331
nevermind.

398
00:09:51,331 --> 00:09:51,830
That was weird.

399
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:52,200
Yeah.

400
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:52,920
Yeah.

401
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:57,480
I wouldn't mind curious
just to see how cool.

402
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,790
I wouldn't mind being that girl for a day.

403
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:00,653
This is what I say.

404
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:02,010
If I was,

405
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:02,401
if I,

406
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:05,880
if there is a possibility that
you could go into someone's mind,

407
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:06,841
like say this,

408
00:10:06,841 --> 00:10:07,410
say if you,

409
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:10,980
you and your girlfriend got together and
you went into a machine and you swapped

410
00:10:10,981 --> 00:10:11,814
positions.

411
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,070
Like she became the girl
and you became the guy.

412
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:15,990
Like you had all your knowledge of life,

413
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:20,820
but all of a sudden you thought like a
girl and you wanted to get fucked and you

414
00:10:20,821 --> 00:10:23,220
want to get fucked by you because she's,

415
00:10:23,221 --> 00:10:24,054
you know,

416
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,590
and you are her.

417
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:29,880
So you liked boys and you liked you and
like that would be a way that you could

418
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:33,210
be gay but not be gay because
you'd be gay for yourself.

419
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,350
So you would switch positions
with your girlfriend or,

420
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:39,570
or why you have her thoughts and she
would be banging you doggy style.

421
00:10:39,571 --> 00:10:39,781
You're like,

422
00:10:39,781 --> 00:10:39,931
wow,

423
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:40,900
this does hurt my servant.

424
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,440
This is kind of annoying.

425
00:10:43,441 --> 00:10:44,280
She wasn't lying.

426
00:10:44,281 --> 00:10:45,114
She could be you.

427
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,580
She can feel what it's
like to get head and go,

428
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:47,851
oh,

429
00:10:47,851 --> 00:10:50,400
now I know why you're always
trying to get me to do this.

430
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,080
This is pretty awesome.

431
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:53,770
She's like,

432
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:54,331
it's odd.

433
00:10:54,331 --> 00:10:56,670
I like it better when
I'm looking at it crazy.

434
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,430
I like it better when I'm
looking at you doing this.

435
00:10:59,431 --> 00:11:00,610
I never would have imagined that.

436
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,550
Now I know why you're
always creeping me out.

437
00:11:02,551 --> 00:11:02,980
They didn't.

438
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:06,120
I need to invent this machine just to
make the relationship better and make

439
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,000
everyone's relationship.

440
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:09,780
Well,

441
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,010
there's a problem now man,

442
00:11:11,011 --> 00:11:11,250
this,

443
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:11,461
this,

444
00:11:11,461 --> 00:11:13,530
this weird competition
between men and women.

445
00:11:13,531 --> 00:11:14,730
There's US versus them,

446
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,351
you know,

447
00:11:15,351 --> 00:11:18,990
and there's a bunch of sneaky
fucks that sneak on the other side,

448
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,250
both men and women.

449
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,430
This is a bunch of women
that's down to hang with men.

450
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:24,001
You know,

451
00:11:24,001 --> 00:11:24,511
this is a girl.

452
00:11:24,511 --> 00:11:25,950
She like to come over your house and no,

453
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:27,000
she can watch sports with us.

454
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:28,050
The fuck she can.

455
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:29,620
Goddamn trader,

456
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,780
gender trader over here,

457
00:11:30,781 --> 00:11:31,620
sneaking around,

458
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,600
collecting data to
bring back to the enemy.

459
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:35,803
Yeah.

460
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:44,130
Okay.
