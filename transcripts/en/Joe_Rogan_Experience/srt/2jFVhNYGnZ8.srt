1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,470
Hey everybody,

2
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:04,431
if you're,

3
00:00:04,431 --> 00:00:07,250
if you're tuning in to this and
you're expecting a regular podcast,

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,440
this is definitely not a regular podcast.

5
00:00:09,441 --> 00:00:10,340
This is a podcast.

6
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:15,550
What we sit down and watch the UFC fights
and just sort of talk shit while the

7
00:00:15,861 --> 00:00:16,730
fights are going on.

8
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:18,920
Don't even expect commentary.

9
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:20,090
Don't expect that either.

10
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:21,043
Don't expect,

11
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:25,730
don't expect anything and hopefully you
won't have your expectations shattered.

12
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,600
But with me here is
uncle creepy in McCall,

13
00:00:28,601 --> 00:00:30,560
one of the top flyweights
on the planet earth.

14
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:32,360
And my brother Jimmy Smith,

15
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:36,740
one of the best analysts
slash MMA commentators slash
Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black

16
00:00:36,741 --> 00:00:41,741
belt slash a commentator for Bellator
until they changed the name Bella tour.

17
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,040
And it should be like for now,

18
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:43,260
for now,

19
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,260
still belts for like maybe MMA.

20
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,620
And what we're going to do is we're
just going to a talk while the will,

21
00:00:48,621 --> 00:00:49,401
the fights are going on,

22
00:00:49,401 --> 00:00:53,720
there's a UFC fight night that's
happening right now live from San Antonio.

23
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:55,183
And uh,

24
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,450
we'll let you know.

25
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,290
It's hard to sync up because there's
a little bit of a delay between the

26
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:01,760
Internet and what's on television.

27
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:03,620
I think it's like a 15 second delay.

28
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:07,040
So what we'll do is
we'll just give you like,

29
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,020
fight starts now with us.

30
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:12,050
And so you'll know when to sync
up with the very first fight.

31
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,033
So until then,

32
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:14,570
it'll be kind of a cluster fuck.

33
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,880
But the card is pretty fucking dope.

34
00:01:16,881 --> 00:01:19,670
I'm very excited about cub
Swanson and Jeremy Stevens.

35
00:01:19,671 --> 00:01:20,680
That's a good fucking fight.

36
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:22,880
I'm not excited about this man.

37
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:24,610
He's been dogging this
since we got in here.

38
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:27,410
You're friends with both of
them and someone's getting
their ass kicked at night

39
00:01:27,411 --> 00:01:27,831
and then like,

40
00:01:27,831 --> 00:01:28,550
fuck,

41
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:29,630
I'm friends with both of them too.

42
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,280
I like both guys tremendously.

43
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:32,450
I liked them as fighters.

44
00:01:32,451 --> 00:01:33,500
I liked them as people,

45
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:34,550
but damn,

46
00:01:34,551 --> 00:01:35,384
I want to see them fight.

47
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:36,290
It's going to be exciting.

48
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:37,323
Oh good.

49
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,233
No doubt about it.

50
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,470
Impossible to not be right.

51
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:40,640
There's no way.

52
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,211
And uh,

53
00:01:41,211 --> 00:01:41,901
also,

54
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:42,110
uh,

55
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:43,300
Calvin gasoline,

56
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:43,870
uh,

57
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,350
who Miss Weight again?

58
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:47,540
He's fighting a Nico Moose Skokie.

59
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:48,511
Who?

60
00:01:48,511 --> 00:01:49,620
Soki how'd he say it was?

61
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,270
Soki whatever you say it.

62
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,270
The dude's Badass.

63
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:54,230
I've seen him fight.

64
00:01:54,231 --> 00:01:55,064
He's excellent.

65
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:55,641
Very,

66
00:01:55,641 --> 00:01:56,480
very good fighter.

67
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,110
Um,

68
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:57,591
he,

69
00:01:57,591 --> 00:01:57,850
uh,

70
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:59,720
fights out of Sweden.

71
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:03,740
He's a one of those dudes that
trains with Gustafson I believe.

72
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,143
And uh,

73
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,610
he's a very talented,

74
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,400
very talented and very
complete all round game.

75
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,421
So that's the,

76
00:02:11,421 --> 00:02:15,860
that's the Co main event and a lot of
good fights on the undercard as well.

77
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:16,993
It's um,

78
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,450
it's live right now from San Antonio,

79
00:02:20,451 --> 00:02:21,284
Texas.

80
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:22,110
Who else is on there?

81
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:22,651
Card here.

82
00:02:22,651 --> 00:02:24,540
I'm going to see Diaz versus llamas.

83
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:27,031
Yes,

84
00:02:27,031 --> 00:02:27,451
that's right.

85
00:02:27,451 --> 00:02:28,860
Ricardo Lamas is on this card,

86
00:02:28,861 --> 00:02:29,131
right?

87
00:02:29,131 --> 00:02:29,821
Yes.

88
00:02:29,821 --> 00:02:31,380
He's fighting Huck Ron Diaz.

89
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:32,370
He fought an m one.

90
00:02:32,371 --> 00:02:33,690
A covered a few of his fights.

91
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,230
Did you?

92
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:34,411
Yeah,

93
00:02:34,411 --> 00:02:35,760
he's Novan y'all great Jujitsu,

94
00:02:35,761 --> 00:02:36,750
the nine submissions,

95
00:02:36,751 --> 00:02:37,770
nine and his career.

96
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,870
But he's exactly the kind of guy you want.

97
00:02:39,871 --> 00:02:42,810
If you're Ricardo lumps this
camp because he's dangerous.

98
00:02:42,811 --> 00:02:44,130
He's not that well rounded.

99
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:46,350
There's not a lot of x factor to his game.

100
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,161
You want llamas,

101
00:02:47,161 --> 00:02:47,610
you know,

102
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,070
mentally ready to get back in there.

103
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,850
I thought he had a good
fight for the title,

104
00:02:50,851 --> 00:02:51,780
but you want,

105
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:55,740
you got back on the horse pretty quick
and Diaz is the right guy for that.

106
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:56,231
Yeah.

107
00:02:56,231 --> 00:02:57,280
What did you think of that fight?

108
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:58,630
Lomis and uh,

109
00:02:58,900 --> 00:02:59,733
and um,

110
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,040
although I think all those,

111
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:01,883
just on another level,

112
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:02,351
yeah,

113
00:03:02,351 --> 00:03:02,801
all those,

114
00:03:02,801 --> 00:03:04,420
just for the first two rounds,

115
00:03:04,421 --> 00:03:06,970
he's the baddest motherfucker on
earth for the first two rounds.

116
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,100
Do you think it's lazy or do
you think you just can't keep,

117
00:03:09,101 --> 00:03:10,000
keep that weight cut?

118
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:10,960
That weight cuts brutal.

119
00:03:10,961 --> 00:03:11,920
The dude walks around in one,

120
00:03:11,921 --> 00:03:12,754
seven days.

121
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:15,720
Like I saw a member zeal and Andy plus
he just looks like a Predator walking.

122
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:17,641
I was like,

123
00:03:17,641 --> 00:03:18,290
that guy's book.

124
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:20,850
What's strange about the
Lama side if you look at it,

125
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:24,360
is that that was a fight where
you paste himself pretty well.

126
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:25,223
Like you know,

127
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:29,040
he didn't look like he was expanding a
ton of energy in the first rounds like it

128
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:29,690
usually does.

129
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:29,911
Right.

130
00:03:29,911 --> 00:03:31,930
And yet he still didn't have
gas in the first fifth round.

131
00:03:31,931 --> 00:03:35,460
So I think it is the weight cut where
it's just he only has so many minutes,

132
00:03:35,461 --> 00:03:37,530
the clock starts no matter what he does.

133
00:03:37,531 --> 00:03:40,440
Cause he didn't do a lot of wild stuff
in the beginning and he's still renting a

134
00:03:40,441 --> 00:03:41,220
gas in the fifth round.

135
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,330
Do you remember when he fought?

136
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:43,580
Not In Toronto.

137
00:03:43,581 --> 00:03:47,240
And they had that enormous car and they
had all the fighters up on the deck and

138
00:03:47,241 --> 00:03:49,490
everybody said he was the one
who we fight fought hom nick,

139
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,560
he was gonna pass out a so sick.

140
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,630
He was so sick that he couldn't,

141
00:03:53,631 --> 00:03:54,710
he couldn't just sit there,

142
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:57,020
he couldn't sit that they had to take
him off the desk and they had to bring

143
00:03:57,021 --> 00:03:57,854
them downstairs.

144
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,020
And this is before he weighed in,

145
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:00,590
you know,

146
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:01,051
I mean it was really,

147
00:04:01,051 --> 00:04:04,100
it's ridiculous to ask a fighter before
they weigh in and put a fucking suit on

148
00:04:04,101 --> 00:04:07,310
and strap your belt on and pretend that
everything's fine when meanwhile you're

149
00:04:07,311 --> 00:04:08,240
on death's door,

150
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:08,840
you know,

151
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,340
how much do you cut when you cut weight?

152
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:15,080
I was one 40 after practice this
morning and Ian Fights at 125 pounds,

153
00:04:15,081 --> 00:04:17,180
one of the top hundred 25
pounders on the planet.

154
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:17,691
So He's,

155
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:19,310
he knows what the fuck he's talking about.

156
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:23,360
So one 40 for you and when you get
down like the week of the fight,

157
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,350
woody tried away.

158
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,520
I try to walk around under
one 41 39 is okay with you.

159
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,100
I'd rather be one 35,

160
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:32,480
but that's probably not going to happen.

161
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:33,590
And we need the lighter I get,

162
00:04:33,591 --> 00:04:34,424
the better I fight.

163
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:35,030
It seems.

164
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:37,520
Do you drink a shitload
of water the week of,

165
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:40,010
to get your body used to just
pumping it out of your system?

166
00:04:40,011 --> 00:04:42,110
Is that the idea of mining distilled?

167
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:42,291
I mean,

168
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:45,530
it took us a few days to find
distilled water in Brazil,

169
00:04:45,531 --> 00:04:46,364
but we did it.

170
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:46,791
Yeah.

171
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:47,960
You have to find distilled water,

172
00:04:47,961 --> 00:04:48,201
right?

173
00:04:48,201 --> 00:04:48,530
Yeah.

174
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:49,160
Why is that?

175
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:49,971
No minerals in it.

176
00:04:49,971 --> 00:04:50,391
The minerals,

177
00:04:50,391 --> 00:04:53,390
retaining water strips your body of
all the salts and stuff and minerals.

178
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:53,751
And then,

179
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:54,170
um,

180
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:55,250
but most people don't do this.

181
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,050
You have to replenish the body.

182
00:04:57,051 --> 00:04:57,884
But those minerals,

183
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:58,993
right?

184
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,900
Like if you get that company,

185
00:04:59,901 --> 00:05:01,340
that company called called trace minerals,

186
00:05:01,341 --> 00:05:02,450
that makes trace minerals.

187
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:04,310
You can,

188
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,143
I put them in my,

189
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:07,700
my water before I go to bed every night.

190
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,170
Every night while you're trained.

191
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:09,740
Yeah.

192
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,700
That's a huge thing.

193
00:05:10,701 --> 00:05:11,511
Just for your health.

194
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:12,380
People don't understand.

195
00:05:12,381 --> 00:05:13,670
And my girlfriend,

196
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,031
she,

197
00:05:14,031 --> 00:05:14,864
uh,

198
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,400
just learned out the hard way.

199
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,700
So she learned out the hard way
or she learned the hard way.

200
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:20,451
Uh,

201
00:05:20,451 --> 00:05:21,290
she,

202
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:24,620
she works out so hard as
yoga hot yoga like every day,

203
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:25,603
twice a day.

204
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,553
She's kind of crazy.

205
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:26,811
I know.

206
00:05:26,811 --> 00:05:27,500
She's listening.

207
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,260
I love you crazy in a good way.

208
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,133
It's a very nice,

209
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:32,571
she's cool.

210
00:05:32,571 --> 00:05:33,404
Crazy.

211
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:34,250
But uh,

212
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,083
she,

213
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:35,440
I bought,

214
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,250
I bought her the drops because
I know what she's doing.

215
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:37,881
I mean,

216
00:05:37,881 --> 00:05:38,770
I give her all kinds of stuff,

217
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:38,990
man.

218
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:39,890
She does take her vitamins,

219
00:05:39,891 --> 00:05:42,010
but she just does,

220
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:44,500
is hardheaded and doesn't listen to it.

221
00:05:44,501 --> 00:05:44,920
But now she,

222
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,220
she figured out she
needs to take that stuff.

223
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:46,341
Well,

224
00:05:46,341 --> 00:05:47,300
what made her figure it out?

225
00:05:47,301 --> 00:05:48,230
You said she got sick.

226
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:48,741
Oh,

227
00:05:48,741 --> 00:05:49,061
she just,

228
00:05:49,061 --> 00:05:49,251
just,

229
00:05:49,251 --> 00:05:50,150
just wasn't feeling good,

230
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:50,640
you know,

231
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,040
during a practice.

232
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,600
And you think it's because of minerals?

233
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:54,291
Yeah.

234
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:54,421
Well,

235
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:56,910
she sweats out that much
and does not drink it.

236
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:57,980
Doesn't ever try and retain

237
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:58,220
them.

238
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:58,401
Well,

239
00:05:58,401 --> 00:05:59,450
that's the thing that they were saying.

240
00:05:59,451 --> 00:06:00,350
Like they had a thing.

241
00:06:00,351 --> 00:06:00,561
Okay,

242
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:01,111
first fight.

243
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:02,060
He's going to go on right now.

244
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:04,670
It's Joe Ellenberger versus James Moon.

245
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:05,923
Moon,

246
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,160
Moon task three.

247
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:07,821
Shit,

248
00:06:07,821 --> 00:06:10,730
we probably should have
listened outset then task three.

249
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,740
Let's go with one toss free.

250
00:06:12,741 --> 00:06:13,110
Right.

251
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:13,520
Um,

252
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,800
I never seen this gel and
fight in the UFC before.

253
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:17,420
It must be a one of his,

254
00:06:17,421 --> 00:06:17,870
uh,

255
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:18,720
first fight.

256
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:19,603
He hasn't,

257
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,800
he's been fighting really since 2011.

258
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,660
He has had his first and
like 2008 or something.

259
00:06:23,661 --> 00:06:25,640
But really since 2011 he's been fighting.

260
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,980
So the asthma seen that long fair,

261
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:33,010
fairly newbie and Ellenberger is the
brother of Jake Ellenberger who is a top

262
00:06:33,651 --> 00:06:37,490
UFC welterweight and Jo Ellen burgers
had some serious health issues.

263
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,421
So a,

264
00:06:38,421 --> 00:06:40,820
for him just to get into the UFC,

265
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:41,683
it was been a,

266
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,960
like a lot of people were
saying that he was going to die,

267
00:06:44,961 --> 00:06:46,900
who's going to have a very short lifespan.

268
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:49,520
He would never be able to
fight competitively again.

269
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,830
So to see him get in good enough shape to,

270
00:06:51,831 --> 00:06:54,560
to fight in the UFC is
a huge victory for him.

271
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:58,160
They said he wouldn't live past like
30 or something crazy like that.

272
00:06:58,161 --> 00:06:58,640
Yeah,

273
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,990
I remember seeing a walkout shirt,

274
00:06:59,991 --> 00:07:00,811
if I'm not mistaken,

275
00:07:00,811 --> 00:07:04,580
that I thought he was like on death's
door at the time or something.

276
00:07:04,581 --> 00:07:05,390
I forget what it was.

277
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:05,691
Yeah,

278
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:06,590
it wasn't good.

279
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:08,480
At one point in time it was not good.

280
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:10,060
So whatever his diseases,

281
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:13,340
the medication costs 440 grand a year,

282
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,370
Jesus and insurance is gonna cover him.

283
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,750
And he's on that right now.

284
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:18,230
I don't,

285
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:18,890
I don't know.

286
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:19,311
I know,

287
00:07:19,311 --> 00:07:20,930
I know that that was the first problem.

288
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,430
Oh my God.

289
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,650
Fucking pharmaceutical companies.

290
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:25,503
Yeah,

291
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,660
you're going to die soon,

292
00:07:26,661 --> 00:07:30,200
but the medication that'll
save you is $440,000.

293
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:30,500
Yeah.

294
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,370
Let's Jack up some,

295
00:07:31,371 --> 00:07:31,520
uh,

296
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,181
some sound here,

297
00:07:32,181 --> 00:07:32,511
Jamie,

298
00:07:32,511 --> 00:07:33,710
so we could see what's going on here.

299
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:42,790
It's just nice to see
him realize his dream.

300
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:43,210
You know,

301
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:45,970
it's gotta be a brutal thing to see your,

302
00:07:45,971 --> 00:07:46,751
your health slip.

303
00:07:46,751 --> 00:07:46,990
Like,

304
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:47,171
oh,

305
00:07:47,171 --> 00:07:48,130
we just got tagged

306
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:49,703
as you were.

307
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:50,301
Yeah.

308
00:07:50,301 --> 00:07:50,431
The,

309
00:07:50,431 --> 00:07:50,691
I mean,

310
00:07:50,691 --> 00:07:52,940
it has to be a young athlete that's,

311
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:53,421
you know,

312
00:07:53,421 --> 00:07:53,990
on,

313
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:54,823
on,

314
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:56,570
just about to get on the big stage.

315
00:07:56,571 --> 00:07:57,261
He's just got signed,

316
00:07:57,261 --> 00:07:57,411
what,

317
00:07:57,411 --> 00:07:58,244
five years ago?

318
00:07:58,670 --> 00:07:58,881
Yeah,

319
00:07:58,881 --> 00:07:59,714
it was quite awhile ago.

320
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,680
This is his first fight.

321
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,980
What do you guys think about that position
that keeps coming up over and over

322
00:08:03,981 --> 00:08:04,730
again now?

323
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:04,890
Uh,

324
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:05,370
the travel,

325
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:06,530
I call it the Travis Browne.

326
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,190
When dudes are going for that single and
they're clinging onto that leg and they

327
00:08:10,191 --> 00:08:14,240
leave that exposed head and they just
get blasted with short turn elbow man.

328
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:14,661
Woo.

329
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:15,411
Travis Browne,

330
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:16,940
throw some heat and those elbows.

331
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:18,020
He's a big scary person.

332
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:19,010
Ooh.

333
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,140
That was exactly where to put it.

334
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:22,700
Exactly where to put it.

335
00:08:22,701 --> 00:08:23,830
He fucking hammer.

336
00:08:23,831 --> 00:08:25,520
Some were repeated.

337
00:08:25,521 --> 00:08:27,200
They're coming down fast and hard.

338
00:08:27,201 --> 00:08:27,501
Boom,

339
00:08:27,501 --> 00:08:27,741
boom,

340
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:28,041
boom,

341
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:28,311
boom,

342
00:08:28,311 --> 00:08:28,730
boom.

343
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:30,260
By the time the referee gets there,

344
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:31,100
I mean the referee,

345
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,570
especially if it's a fat referee,

346
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,280
he's got to take three or four steps.

347
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:38,180
Travis Brown's getting in at least
two elbows on an unconscious opponent.

348
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:40,560
He played by Josh out just out instantly.

349
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:41,763
No one's ever done that.

350
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:42,643
Josh,

351
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:43,130
he Pedro,

352
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:44,510
his own knocked him out before,

353
00:08:44,511 --> 00:08:47,030
but it was with one perfectly oh cool.

354
00:08:47,031 --> 00:08:48,140
Flying knee attempt there.

355
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,700
Ellen Burger's got a good team.

356
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:50,990
Weird and Ellenberger.

357
00:08:50,991 --> 00:08:51,824
That's tough.

358
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:52,663
Yeah,

359
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:54,920
that knows how to wrestle.

360
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:55,681
Oh,

361
00:08:55,681 --> 00:08:56,514
look at this

362
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:57,663
and working on that.

363
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,280
Doris,

364
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,910
knock him his body weight on it though.

365
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,833
Nope.

366
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,413
The struggle.

367
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:02,821
Now,

368
00:09:02,821 --> 00:09:04,620
if you're fighting a guy
who is a late replacement,

369
00:09:04,621 --> 00:09:05,310
like Mutasa fee,

370
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:06,870
this is how you want
to fight where I'm out.

371
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,590
Because if you're finding
guys a late replacement,

372
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:11,401
you have two options.

373
00:09:11,401 --> 00:09:12,380
If you're in Mutasa,

374
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:15,840
either come in and throw everything
you got in the first round or try and

375
00:09:15,841 --> 00:09:17,970
conserve your energy and chose not
let them do either one of those.

376
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,920
What was the original opponent?

377
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,233
Do you know?

378
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,141
I don't remember.

379
00:09:22,141 --> 00:09:22,980
I don't remember either,

380
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,980
but Mutasa what did he take this on?

381
00:09:25,981 --> 00:09:27,030
Two weeks notice or something?

382
00:09:27,031 --> 00:09:27,864
Something short.

383
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:29,980
Okay.

384
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,240
What do you guys think about that?

385
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,030
Touching the hand on the
ground to prevent the knees.

386
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,930
That's that man that,

387
00:09:35,931 --> 00:09:37,450
that seems super silly to me.

388
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,900
You can't do it when a
strike is headed for you.

389
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:40,440
Right?

390
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,940
So guys do it really early.

391
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,013
Um,

392
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:44,131
it's just,

393
00:09:44,131 --> 00:09:44,964
you know,

394
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:46,710
it's always going to be a tactic.

395
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:47,730
Can't really get around it.

396
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:47,971
Well,

397
00:09:47,971 --> 00:09:48,880
last they changed the,

398
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:49,260
oh,

399
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,000
he got hit hard and you get hit hard.

400
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:52,501
He does.

401
00:09:52,501 --> 00:09:53,111
Eyes aren't open.

402
00:09:53,111 --> 00:09:53,731
He's really hurt.

403
00:09:53,731 --> 00:09:53,881
Yeah,

404
00:09:53,881 --> 00:09:54,541
he started hard.

405
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:55,374
His eyes hurt,

406
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:56,383
nose busted.

407
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,770
I think it's his nose because
he can't open his eyes.

408
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,170
Okay.

409
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:01,640
When Tasha was getting after him,

410
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:02,563
damn.

411
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,960
Lots of back of the head.

412
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,850
He wins design,

413
00:10:08,851 --> 00:10:09,450
whatever.

414
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:10,740
Whenever it was that happened,

415
00:10:10,741 --> 00:10:12,090
it was pretty fucking serious.

416
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,620
It looked like it popped his nose.

417
00:10:13,621 --> 00:10:14,454
I think.

418
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:14,820
Well,

419
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:15,090
we'll,

420
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:17,100
we'll probably get a shot
at in between rounds,

421
00:10:17,101 --> 00:10:19,710
but Mutasa furry is punching
and he's just covering up here,

422
00:10:19,711 --> 00:10:20,544
holding on,

423
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:21,630
lost the single

424
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:26,330
and he goes to his back.

425
00:10:26,331 --> 00:10:27,290
He looks like he's all right.

426
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:28,723
You see blood.

427
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:30,980
I thought I saw think it's from the nose.

428
00:10:30,981 --> 00:10:31,800
Yep.

429
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,633
Yup.

430
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:34,411
Let's see.

431
00:10:34,411 --> 00:10:35,460
Ellenberger is guard.

432
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:36,271
Oh,

433
00:10:36,271 --> 00:10:37,560
exposed knows too.

434
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:38,391
Yeah.

435
00:10:38,391 --> 00:10:39,061
This his nose.

436
00:10:39,061 --> 00:10:39,930
His nose is bad.

437
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:45,060
Your vision completely
goes when that happens.

438
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:45,953
Completely.

439
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,850
Okay.

440
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:48,661
Staying aggressive.

441
00:10:48,661 --> 00:10:49,494
But

442
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:53,000
this is where it's super
important to have a guard.

443
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:56,060
There's so many guys that just don't
ever think they're going to be on their

444
00:10:56,061 --> 00:10:56,670
back.

445
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:56,910
No,

446
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:57,170
they,

447
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:57,740
it's,

448
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,110
come on Sophie,

449
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,670
do you see somebody off
their back and you're like,

450
00:11:01,671 --> 00:11:02,210
wow,

451
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:03,350
like you don't know what you're doing.

452
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,400
I have no idea what you're doing.

453
00:11:04,401 --> 00:11:05,420
You're completely lost.

454
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,300
I've talked to guys who were
top level guys and they're like,

455
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:08,541
man,

456
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:09,440
I'm not going to be on my back.

457
00:11:09,441 --> 00:11:09,711
I'm like,

458
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:10,544
okay,

459
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,170
well you hope you're not going to
be on your back and I hope for you,

460
00:11:14,171 --> 00:11:15,350
you're not going to be on your back.

461
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,780
But if you fighting somebody like you,

462
00:11:17,781 --> 00:11:20,060
don't you think you could
probably put you on your back?

463
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:20,271
Yeah.

464
00:11:20,271 --> 00:11:23,150
Well there's use out there
then they're not the only one.

465
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:23,391
Right.

466
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:27,410
It's like the idea of acting like you're
the only guy that can do a certain

467
00:11:27,411 --> 00:11:27,980
thing.

468
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:28,820
That's crazy.

469
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:30,950
Like thinking you're the only
guy that can take you down.

470
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,290
You take guys down so you're
going to be on top always.

471
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:34,820
That seems unlikely.

472
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:37,630
There's no weapon in MMA you don't need.

473
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,590
Absolutely.

474
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:39,310
When I,

475
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:39,671
it's funny,

476
00:11:39,671 --> 00:11:41,890
when you talk to guys and you're
in the gym and they go out to,

477
00:11:41,891 --> 00:11:42,724
I don't want to,

478
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,200
I don't want to know that,

479
00:11:44,201 --> 00:11:44,980
and I went,

480
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,030
it's like going into war and going,

481
00:11:46,031 --> 00:11:46,864
I don't need grenades.

482
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,501
I'll never,

483
00:11:47,501 --> 00:11:49,040
I'll never be in the situation
where I need a grenade,

484
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:52,260
a band at a in that fight
fighter on how to get up close.

485
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,530
I want to look them in the went dude.

486
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,011
A life.

487
00:11:54,011 --> 00:11:54,611
I'm a sniper.

488
00:11:54,611 --> 00:11:55,390
I don't need a grenade.

489
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:57,070
Well that you're going to be
in that position where you go,

490
00:11:57,071 --> 00:11:57,401
God,

491
00:11:57,401 --> 00:11:58,900
I just wish I had a grenade right now.

492
00:11:58,990 --> 00:11:59,531
Exactly.

493
00:11:59,531 --> 00:12:00,700
Especially mentality,

494
00:12:00,701 --> 00:12:01,140
man.

495
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:01,680
Yup.

496
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,310
Alan burgers.

497
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:02,521
Yeah.

498
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:03,510
His nose is fucked.

499
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:04,301
Oh.

500
00:12:04,301 --> 00:12:05,480
Mutasa his mom.

501
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:06,803
Good hip escape.

502
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:12,000
A lot of guys don't have to have
shitty sweeps in half guard.

503
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:14,610
Like his goto deep half here.

504
00:12:14,611 --> 00:12:18,510
He's just sorta La langue Langer and
around lingering around the in his half

505
00:12:18,511 --> 00:12:19,320
guard.

506
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:19,561
You need,

507
00:12:19,561 --> 00:12:21,300
she'd be sucking up to that guy's body.

508
00:12:21,301 --> 00:12:23,160
But I think Ellenberger is hurt here.

509
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:24,780
I think he's still trying to recover.

510
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:28,080
Half Guard is one of the things you see
all the time and high level Jujitsu.

511
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:31,050
They have outstanding half cards and you
almost never see a good half guard in

512
00:12:31,051 --> 00:12:31,440
MMA.

513
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,130
So true guards and half guard
or just anything off your back.

514
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,500
It's is it punches and elbows is,

515
00:12:37,501 --> 00:12:38,700
I mean it's gotta be what it is.

516
00:12:38,701 --> 00:12:40,200
Guys don't want to get punched in elbows.

517
00:12:40,201 --> 00:12:41,034
They just want to hold.

518
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:43,440
I want to submit somebody,

519
00:12:43,441 --> 00:12:44,274
I mean it's,

520
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,533
it's an option.

521
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:47,580
It's like Daniel Cormier was saying,

522
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,960
we were talking before this thing
started that cornea and Dominick Cruz are

523
00:12:51,961 --> 00:12:53,640
fucking killing it as analysts.

524
00:12:53,641 --> 00:12:56,100
I love listening to those
guys talk and their insight,

525
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,870
but one of the things that
they were talking about,

526
00:12:57,871 --> 00:12:59,670
the main event cubs cub,

527
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:04,290
Swanson and Jeremy Stephens was that
Jeremy Stevens has got to be a little bit

528
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:05,220
more unpredictable.

529
00:13:05,221 --> 00:13:07,590
It's got to throw a few
more variables into the mix,

530
00:13:07,591 --> 00:13:09,600
like take down attempts and
things along those lines.

531
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,340
And I've always said that that's like,

532
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,620
even if you don't want to take a guy down,

533
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,460
if you think if you make it,

534
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:16,950
I think that you're
trying to take him down,

535
00:13:16,951 --> 00:13:19,980
then he has to think about that and it's
one more piece of information has to

536
00:13:19,981 --> 00:13:20,730
process.

537
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,950
If you're only making
a guy process stand up,

538
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,420
it's infinitely easier.

539
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,493
It's so much easier.

540
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:29,520
It's the main reason why George St Pierre
was so successful beside the fact that

541
00:13:29,521 --> 00:13:30,630
he's a bad motherfucker.

542
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,510
He was one of the very best at,

543
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,050
you didn't know what was going on.

544
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,790
He didn't know if he was
going to try to take you down,

545
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:39,600
if he's going to stand up with you and
the comfort level that he had because he

546
00:13:39,601 --> 00:13:41,070
had fought so many championship fights.

547
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:41,731
He'd been there,

548
00:13:41,731 --> 00:13:42,600
done that many times.

549
00:13:42,601 --> 00:13:43,434
So you'd see guys,

550
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,490
they'd be in the bright lights.

551
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:44,941
Holy Shit,

552
00:13:44,941 --> 00:13:45,840
I'm fighting GSP,

553
00:13:45,841 --> 00:13:46,270
and they didn't.

554
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:47,730
It just didn't know what was common.

555
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:52,080
And those two factors together combined
for an incredible look at this,

556
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,220
they're checking it,

557
00:13:53,221 --> 00:13:54,240
look just right out in burgers.

558
00:13:54,241 --> 00:13:55,350
Eyes look at his right eye.

559
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,300
Justin Bieber's in the cage with them.

560
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,320
Holy Shit.

561
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:00,510
Okay.

562
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:02,210
I think they're worried about
a fracture when you can't.

563
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:04,830
A lot of times when the eye drops like
that and that's what they're worried

564
00:14:04,831 --> 00:14:05,071
about,

565
00:14:05,071 --> 00:14:06,060
but it looks like the letting them go.

566
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:06,641
Yeah,

567
00:14:06,641 --> 00:14:07,690
it could be a fracture.

568
00:14:07,691 --> 00:14:09,550
A lot of times it's a
fracture of the eye swells up.

569
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,011
Yeah.

570
00:14:10,011 --> 00:14:12,700
And that's a lit drops and
they can't really move the eye.

571
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:12,990
Yeah,

572
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:13,940
that's what it seems like they're,

573
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,330
wow.

574
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:15,280
Look at what it looks like.

575
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:16,820
That's crazy.

576
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:17,631
Yo.

577
00:14:17,631 --> 00:14:19,340
I've never seen it closed on like that.

578
00:14:19,341 --> 00:14:20,031
It looks weird.

579
00:14:20,031 --> 00:14:20,660
It's like sloths,

580
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,050
man.

581
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:21,980
You know what it looks like.

582
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,180
It looks like the nerves in his,

583
00:14:23,181 --> 00:14:25,880
I just stopped working
like it's not swollen up.

584
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:26,960
It's just shutting.

585
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:27,561
It's,

586
00:14:27,561 --> 00:14:27,771
well,

587
00:14:27,771 --> 00:14:28,810
he was wincing for a reason.

588
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,340
He's probably fucked on that side.

589
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,770
He probably can't see
left hooks at all though.

590
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:36,343
Okay.

591
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:36,831
It's funny,

592
00:14:36,831 --> 00:14:37,190
you know.

593
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:38,023
Oh Shit.

594
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:42,680
He's a guy who's going through a situation
like Ellenberger as you can't help

595
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:43,514
but root for them.

596
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:44,450
But um,

597
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:45,283
Mutasa Murray,

598
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:48,800
he's dealing with a great fucking job
in this fight is especially on short

599
00:14:48,801 --> 00:14:49,131
notice.

600
00:14:49,131 --> 00:14:49,964
It looks very good.

601
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:51,590
What's funny to about,

602
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,070
like

603
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:54,530
we were saying about not,

604
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:55,460
you know,

605
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,720
not having complete games,

606
00:14:56,721 --> 00:15:00,500
is that something that happens in all
combat sports and yet people don't think

607
00:15:00,501 --> 00:15:01,700
it applies him in boxing.

608
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:02,121
They always say,

609
00:15:02,121 --> 00:15:03,320
if you can't sell the Jab,

610
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,580
I'm not going to buy your
right hand if I don't sell.

611
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:06,950
If you don't sell me on the first one,

612
00:15:06,951 --> 00:15:08,240
you're not going to get the combination.

613
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:09,980
And people don't think that way in MMA,

614
00:15:09,981 --> 00:15:10,850
which is a little strange.

615
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:11,371
Yeah.

616
00:15:11,371 --> 00:15:11,701
And you know,

617
00:15:11,701 --> 00:15:13,310
and right here Ellenberger
has gotten tossed.

618
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,120
She's back very nice.

619
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,430
And he has a leg in on the cage side,

620
00:15:17,431 --> 00:15:18,570
which is the hard side to get in.

621
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:22,560
So fucking hard to get a rear naked
choke with these goddamn gloves.

622
00:15:22,561 --> 00:15:23,394
Yeah.

623
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:25,290
For folks who just do Jujitsu,

624
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:28,920
do yourself a favor one day and do
some Oola like I was trapping the arm,

625
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:29,730
do some Gigi,

626
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:32,520
got the both hooks and do
some Jujitsu with gloves on.

627
00:15:32,521 --> 00:15:33,870
You'll be astounded at.

628
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:35,850
It makes chokes 20% harder.

629
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,350
20% hard to get.

630
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:38,220
I went to,

631
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,420
I would take the item with my leg.

632
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:40,830
Yeah.

633
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:41,280
Yeah.

634
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:41,491
I mean,

635
00:15:41,491 --> 00:15:43,800
especially after having Bj do it to me.

636
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:44,933
Oh,

637
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:47,010
it's just frightening.

638
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:47,501
Bj.

639
00:15:47,501 --> 00:15:48,540
So good at that.

640
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,610
He loves getting that rear naked choke.

641
00:15:50,611 --> 00:15:51,690
Trapping the arms.

642
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:52,450
Yeah,

643
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:53,310
it's been,

644
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:53,520
he,

645
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,300
he,

646
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,100
he's only 160 pounds.

647
00:15:56,490 --> 00:16:01,490
I was 150 going out there
and he felt so heavy on top.

648
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:03,870
Was He so good on the ground?

649
00:16:03,871 --> 00:16:05,220
It's just ridiculous.

650
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:05,530
Yeah.

651
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:09,870
Bj in his prime was one of the
elite of the elite in Jujitsu.

652
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:10,320
Yeah.

653
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,440
A lot of folks don't know
that and he got there quick

654
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:12,861
first.

655
00:16:12,861 --> 00:16:15,230
Non Brazilian wold champion
took it in three years.

656
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:15,831
Three years.

657
00:16:15,831 --> 00:16:16,890
He got his black belt.

658
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,340
Boom one the one the owls.

659
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:19,740
He's got the Darce.

660
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,551
Ellenberg got this.

661
00:16:21,551 --> 00:16:23,890
Doris Betty to sit his hip out.

662
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,270
If he pulls this off,

663
00:16:26,271 --> 00:16:27,104
good for it.

664
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,251
He needs it.

665
00:16:28,251 --> 00:16:29,350
You can't help but root for the guy.

666
00:16:29,351 --> 00:16:31,370
Got a lot of space there under
that right armpit though,

667
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:37,103
right?

668
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,170
Is going to give it up?

669
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:39,003
Yeah.

670
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,173
Yeah.

671
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:40,631
Oh,

672
00:16:40,631 --> 00:16:41,860
now he's going ducking under it.

673
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:43,870
Jeff Glover style.

674
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:44,591
Yes.

675
00:16:44,591 --> 00:16:45,330
Here we go.

676
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:46,163
Kids a stud.

677
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:47,020
Oh yeah.

678
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,040
He doesn't have it though.

679
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:48,963
Nope.

680
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:50,231
Yeah.

681
00:16:50,231 --> 00:16:51,140
Now he's on top.

682
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:52,023
Didn't put his hips down.

683
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,680
Do you like the Japanese Necktie?

684
00:16:53,681 --> 00:16:54,514
Do you ever use that?

685
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,280
Okay.

686
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,780
I find them really hard
to get really have,

687
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:58,940
I have really big foreign,

688
00:16:58,941 --> 00:17:01,940
it's really hard for me to get
them checked it off so much,

689
00:17:01,941 --> 00:17:02,331
Bro.

690
00:17:02,331 --> 00:17:02,541
Dude,

691
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:03,201
I can't man.

692
00:17:03,201 --> 00:17:04,490
I'm on the road three months at a time,

693
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:05,324
Bro.

694
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:06,350
Three months.

695
00:17:06,351 --> 00:17:07,041
I'm on the road.

696
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:07,970
Case of a fleshlight.

697
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,020
Oh my God.

698
00:17:09,021 --> 00:17:11,050
He's the Codeword Rogan and say 15 or so.

699
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:15,460
Ellenberger is still on the bottom here.

700
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:17,991
Hey Ya.

701
00:17:17,991 --> 00:17:19,160
What did you think of glory?

702
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:21,320
How fucking awesome was that good man.

703
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,450
It was a fun show to my boys.

704
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:23,900
Yeah.

705
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,680
Joe Schilling and a Shane of landscape.

706
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:26,441
Two shillings.

707
00:17:26,441 --> 00:17:27,650
A fucking monster.

708
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,461
He's a monster.

709
00:17:28,461 --> 00:17:33,461
That dude is a beast that knock out of
Simon Marcus Oh shit around and he was

710
00:17:34,371 --> 00:17:35,204
spitting it out.

711
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,290
That was a good,

712
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:37,160
that was a good deduction,

713
00:17:37,161 --> 00:17:37,400
man.

714
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,181
It was big.

715
00:17:38,181 --> 00:17:39,050
Very current deduction.

716
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:40,880
He knows his shit big.

717
00:17:40,881 --> 00:17:42,200
John McCarthy knows his shit.

718
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:46,100
The problem with the one day
tournament though is a lot to,

719
00:17:46,101 --> 00:17:48,340
it's one by the time the finals
rolled around and he's showing me,

720
00:17:48,341 --> 00:17:49,174
she just like,

721
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,250
I have another fight.

722
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:52,350
Maybe he just didn't have a lot left.

723
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:52,741
Well,

724
00:17:52,741 --> 00:17:54,700
that's what I hate seeing
is when it's decided before.

725
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:55,790
I mean he walked in there going,

726
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,310
he goes,

727
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,690
I was amazed you can walk to the ring,

728
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,490
but it's not implemented.

729
00:17:58,490 --> 00:17:59,260
Those fights.

730
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,830
Finding three guys in awe.

731
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,890
Imposturous they had Shane come out.

732
00:18:02,891 --> 00:18:03,071
I mean,

733
00:18:03,071 --> 00:18:04,600
granted Shane isn't,

734
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,381
isn't in shape,

735
00:18:05,381 --> 00:18:08,700
ever throws up after
every time he works out.

736
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,760
The guy's just really talented,

737
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:11,470
but he,

738
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,360
from the last punch he threw,

739
00:18:13,361 --> 00:18:14,800
they waited 30 minutes and the,

740
00:18:14,801 --> 00:18:15,880
and that's what they said.

741
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,013
He literally,

742
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:17,711
you know,

743
00:18:17,711 --> 00:18:17,880
they,

744
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,240
they read that he won,

745
00:18:19,241 --> 00:18:20,170
he walked in the back,

746
00:18:20,171 --> 00:18:21,940
they get changed as gloves
and then he walked back out.

747
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:24,700
And that was,

748
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:24,940
I mean,

749
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,320
I'm sure Joe's was just as hard.

750
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,393
Wow.

751
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,413
They're savages.

752
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,070
This Shane del Rosario,

753
00:18:30,071 --> 00:18:31,700
is that when you're
talking about Shana bonds?

754
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:32,340
Because Shana.

755
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:32,710
Okay.

756
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:32,831
No,

757
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:33,221
Shane.

758
00:18:33,221 --> 00:18:33,341
Oh,

759
00:18:33,341 --> 00:18:33,641
blondes.

760
00:18:33,641 --> 00:18:33,971
Shane.

761
00:18:33,971 --> 00:18:34,061
Oh,

762
00:18:34,061 --> 00:18:34,810
Blonsky yeah,

763
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:36,010
he fought and he fought.

764
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,533
He fought in the featherweight.

765
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:40,480
I need to the finals loss to a Varga.

766
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,240
He's huge at that weight.

767
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:46,390
I was wake up with him and he
missed it and I was fucking pissed.

768
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:47,000
Any medicine.

769
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,920
I was like so mad.

770
00:18:47,921 --> 00:18:50,440
I don't know how bad the
domestic bar two pounds

771
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:54,591
for the,

772
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,420
for the beginning fighters
listening to this,

773
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,343
uh,

774
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:00,440
nothing will piss off or promoted
more than not making weight.

775
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:04,580
It is pretty much like not showing
up for work on like your second day,

776
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,200
you'll get canned fast.

777
00:19:06,201 --> 00:19:06,740
They hate that.

778
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:07,340
No.

779
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:07,641
Ian,

780
00:19:07,641 --> 00:19:08,440
obviously you

781
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:08,921
close to this,

782
00:19:08,921 --> 00:19:11,110
it's hard to look at it objectively,

783
00:19:11,111 --> 00:19:14,050
but do you think that they
should abandon weight cutting?

784
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,120
Do you think they should move
to abandoned weight cutting.

785
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:19,060
And do you think it's ever possible
to abandoned weight cutting?

786
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:20,651
Yes,

787
00:19:20,651 --> 00:19:21,460
they should.

788
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:21,911
Healthier.

789
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:24,070
I'm sure I'd take a few years
off my life every time I do it.

790
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:26,980
So I mean like when I cut in Florida,

791
00:19:26,981 --> 00:19:29,050
I cut 18.8 in the last 20 hours.

792
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:29,510
Oh.

793
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:32,410
And I felt like at first
you're hearing goes yeah.

794
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:33,850
And then your,

795
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:38,290
your vision goes and then you feel your
body start to cramp up and you're like,

796
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,550
I'm fucking dying.

797
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,421
Literally.

798
00:19:40,421 --> 00:19:40,661
Shit.

799
00:19:40,661 --> 00:19:41,261
I'm literally,

800
00:19:41,261 --> 00:19:42,790
this is how people die.

801
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:44,850
And then you have to put on a smile,

802
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:47,040
walk out and stare at the person.

803
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:47,291
Yeah.

804
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:49,690
Flex and stare at the person that
you're going to fight tomorrow.

805
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:50,531
And then,

806
00:19:50,531 --> 00:19:51,130
uh,

807
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:53,720
then you get to drink and
take a couple of sips of PD,

808
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:56,680
like right after he stepped off the
scale because you're literally dying.

809
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:59,260
I've seen some people that
look like they're dying,

810
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,630
tried to in the NCAAs a few years
ago for those that follow it,

811
00:20:02,631 --> 00:20:03,350
they add,

812
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:06,530
you weighed in once and then you
had the whole NCAA tournament,

813
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:07,190
you know,

814
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:08,870
so you went in once and then
he wrestled for three days.

815
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,033
Uh,

816
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:12,500
then a kid at Michigan
died cutting weight.

817
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:12,740
Yeah.

818
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:16,430
It was Kinda like tried to make it easier
by having one weight cut and then they

819
00:20:16,431 --> 00:20:17,241
could wrestle three days.

820
00:20:17,241 --> 00:20:21,140
And then they realized that
just encouraged people to
cut more weight and a kid

821
00:20:21,141 --> 00:20:23,330
from Michigan died and now you've
got to weigh in every time.

822
00:20:23,331 --> 00:20:25,220
And it's like when they make it harder,

823
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:26,540
you know,

824
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:26,811
it's like,

825
00:20:26,811 --> 00:20:27,261
oh my God,

826
00:20:27,261 --> 00:20:28,520
how can meet people
weigh in and then fight?

827
00:20:28,521 --> 00:20:29,000
Well,

828
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,770
it encourages people to cut less weight.

829
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:31,231
It's,

830
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:32,540
it's just you can't win.

831
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:36,620
When they tried to make it like you
had a day in between guys just cut more

832
00:20:36,621 --> 00:20:38,090
weight because they
had a day to rehydrate.

833
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,380
It's cool.

834
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:40,670
I mean,

835
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:44,150
high school and high school coach is
to treat you like you're a pussy if you

836
00:20:44,151 --> 00:20:44,840
don't cut.

837
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:44,991
Oh,

838
00:20:44,991 --> 00:20:46,700
putting on plastics and ugh.

839
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:48,010
And you're 14 which is a world

840
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:50,890
champion at 17 he was from Iraq,

841
00:20:50,891 --> 00:20:51,610
from Iran.

842
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:52,140
Oh No.

843
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:56,030
[inaudible] 17 as was
world champion and he,

844
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:57,840
he left the country so he,

845
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:58,471
he was,

846
00:20:58,471 --> 00:20:58,731
you know,

847
00:20:58,731 --> 00:21:01,240
an exile out here and wasn't able to
wrestle in the Olympics and he would have

848
00:21:01,241 --> 00:21:01,850
won gold.

849
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:02,683
Oh my God.

850
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:03,880
And he,

851
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:08,200
that's the person I was
raised in wrestling by living
in his house like two days

852
00:21:08,201 --> 00:21:08,890
a week,

853
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:10,540
fucking screaming at me and Farsi,

854
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:12,760
Persian food is the best food for you.

855
00:21:12,761 --> 00:21:13,550
Fuck you.

856
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:15,220
[inaudible]

857
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:22,630
every morning demanded things that
I've never seen other people do.

858
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:25,860
Like he's just [inaudible]
and the best person to me,

859
00:21:25,861 --> 00:21:27,190
he'd be definitely saved my life.

860
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,470
That's awesome.

861
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:29,303
That's great man.

862
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:29,821
But as a,

863
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:32,170
as a Raza Bressler was a savage.

864
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:33,580
Those,

865
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:34,331
those guys,

866
00:21:34,331 --> 00:21:34,631
man,

867
00:21:34,631 --> 00:21:35,201
first of all,

868
00:21:35,201 --> 00:21:38,590
wrestling in that part of the
world is enormously important.

869
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:41,050
It's a hugely coveted Olympic sport.

870
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,330
Wrestling in Iran is gigantic.

871
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,000
When the iron was cousins for food,

872
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,890
like the is used to have whoever,

873
00:21:47,891 --> 00:21:50,500
whoever won the kids one that
they would buy the dinner or the,

874
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:51,460
yeah,

875
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,360
the Lizard by the dinner.

876
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:53,320
Jesus Christ.

877
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:57,250
He'd be in the sauna with me massaging
me like a 16 year old kid cutting weight,

878
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:58,391
massaging me,

879
00:21:58,391 --> 00:21:58,801
trying to meet,

880
00:21:58,801 --> 00:21:59,381
get me to cut weight.

881
00:21:59,381 --> 00:22:01,180
And He'd been looking at us
at us and they were like,

882
00:22:01,181 --> 00:22:02,680
what the fuck is this old man doing?

883
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,210
Does he have a little boy
making him sweat in here?

884
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:07,340
I,

885
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,640
the thing about me in
high school was smaller,

886
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,420
was the hundred and three pounds.

887
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:11,570
Wow.

888
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:11,840
Wait,

889
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,190
cluster one three,

890
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:13,740
three,

891
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,010
three is 12 and nineteens.

892
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,040
And what would you actually
way before he started the cut,

893
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:24,070
I remember by senior
year I was probably 35.

894
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:25,540
Uh,

895
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:28,210
I was supposed to cut
weight in high school,

896
00:22:28,211 --> 00:22:29,140
but I wouldn't do it.

897
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:34,320
So I walked around at 135 pounds on a
Russell 134 pounds cause I was like,

898
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:35,483
I'm not doing it.

899
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:36,880
I just like you guys are dying.

900
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,230
I see it all around me.

901
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:40,930
There was a kid that was a
one weight class above me,

902
00:22:40,931 --> 00:22:42,280
this really big,

903
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,290
a really big tall kid.

904
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:45,370
I forget what his name is,

905
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:50,790
but he used to weigh like he would
wrestle at one 40 something and he would

906
00:22:51,011 --> 00:22:56,011
weigh 170 pounds and I just didn't
understand that he was a big kid.

907
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:56,531
You know,

908
00:22:56,531 --> 00:22:58,190
we were 15 at the time where he meet,

909
00:22:58,191 --> 00:22:59,080
he might've been a little older,

910
00:22:59,081 --> 00:23:04,081
maybe 16 but he was a big kid and I was
watching this guy put on rubber suits

911
00:23:04,451 --> 00:23:09,190
and run up hills and rolling around
with covered in towels and shit.

912
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,970
And I was like hiding
under the wrestling mats,

913
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,850
translating under the wrestling mat.

914
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:14,423
I'm not doing it.

915
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,660
And I cut weight a few times
for Taekwondo tournaments.

916
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,430
And then I went up a
weight class and fought,

917
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:21,700
I weighed one 54
[inaudible] 54 it was just,

918
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:22,121
for me,

919
00:23:22,121 --> 00:23:22,781
it was way better.

920
00:23:22,781 --> 00:23:24,220
I was just too lean anyway.

921
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:25,660
I was always walking around,

922
00:23:25,661 --> 00:23:26,890
very low body fat.

923
00:23:26,891 --> 00:23:28,840
So I just felt terrible.

924
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:31,450
The worst I ever saw was Marcos Galvan.

925
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:32,051
He fought chase,

926
00:23:32,051 --> 00:23:32,980
BB and Beltre.

927
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:34,880
He could barely get on the scale.

928
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:35,800
He couldn't walk.

929
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:39,460
And then he got off the scale and he was
going to the elevator and he sat down

930
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:40,570
and he started convulsing.

931
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,530
He started shaking.

932
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:45,980
And what people don't understand
is next day against chase

933
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:46,760
BBI,

934
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,520
he looked great.

935
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:49,940
Phenomenal.

936
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:54,830
The amount they get back almost
encourages that kind of shit when you go.

937
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:56,600
If they walked in there
and just felt so bad,

938
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:57,434
they couldn't fight,

939
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:57,910
you'd,

940
00:23:57,910 --> 00:23:59,030
you wouldn't see guys do it.

941
00:23:59,120 --> 00:23:59,281
Well,

942
00:23:59,281 --> 00:24:00,500
they wrote to cover some of that,

943
00:24:00,501 --> 00:24:01,700
encourages them to do it.

944
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:02,270
You do

945
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:03,230
some guys that you,

946
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:03,801
you know,

947
00:24:03,801 --> 00:24:04,191
they're taking,

948
00:24:04,191 --> 00:24:04,400
you know,

949
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,180
they're hurting.

950
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:05,570
Like,

951
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:05,841
you know,

952
00:24:05,841 --> 00:24:08,940
they get down to like
a perfect example is a,

953
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,190
that dude who,

954
00:24:10,191 --> 00:24:10,521
uh,

955
00:24:10,521 --> 00:24:11,060
was uh,

956
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:13,940
Daniel Seraphim who is
a killer at 185 pounds,

957
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:15,410
just fought at one 70.

958
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,870
And you can see for the moment
he stepped into the octagon,

959
00:24:17,871 --> 00:24:18,201
he was just,

960
00:24:18,201 --> 00:24:21,260
he barely made weight and the
moment he stepped in the octagon,

961
00:24:21,261 --> 00:24:22,890
he just didn't do it.

962
00:24:22,891 --> 00:24:23,690
I couldn't grab it.

963
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:24,560
It was just missing.

964
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:25,910
His timing was off.

965
00:24:25,911 --> 00:24:26,870
His strength was off.

966
00:24:26,871 --> 00:24:27,470
He just,

967
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:28,370
he just didn't have it.

968
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,840
Marquardt just decided to go back
up to 85 beats to Huna last night.

969
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:33,771
What did he say?

970
00:24:33,771 --> 00:24:34,604
God made him,

971
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:35,720
God made him do it.

972
00:24:35,721 --> 00:24:38,260
God told him to fight at 105 yes.

973
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:39,890
Don't you questioning God.

974
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,330
Fuck no bro.

975
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:44,990
Slap on this triangle.

976
00:24:44,991 --> 00:24:48,270
It looks like he's a little
tighter with it now guys.

977
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:49,400
One angle their hips enough.

978
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:50,503
Nope.

979
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:52,070
I also don't know rubber guard.

980
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:52,581
I mean,

981
00:24:52,581 --> 00:24:52,851
you know,

982
00:24:52,851 --> 00:24:55,400
I know a lot of people are prejudice
against Eddie Bravo techniques,

983
00:24:55,401 --> 00:24:57,620
but that fucking mission
control to triangle,

984
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:59,300
they don't know how to attack
off their back with anything.

985
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,240
The rubber garden.

986
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:05,540
MMA is one of the best moves ever because
you can hold a guy down with your arm,

987
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:08,240
you grab him and you're not
just pulling down with your arm.

988
00:25:08,241 --> 00:25:11,900
You point down with your legs as well and
if you have a good triangle set up off

989
00:25:11,901 --> 00:25:12,470
of that,

990
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:13,970
it's just a phenomenal move.

991
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:16,100
So many guys don't do it,

992
00:25:16,101 --> 00:25:19,910
so you're left just trying to use your
legs to pull the guy down or your reach

993
00:25:19,911 --> 00:25:21,170
up and grab his neck.

994
00:25:21,171 --> 00:25:22,130
He knows what you're doing.

995
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:25,940
If you get your hand that under hook on
that ankle and you're pulling down on

996
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:28,100
that ankle with good flexibility
at good rubber guard,

997
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,130
that mission control position
is a devastating position.

998
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:34,400
But even coming from in,

999
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,181
in my case,

1000
00:25:35,181 --> 00:25:36,200
Carlson Gracie style,

1001
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:36,650
which is,

1002
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:37,910
which is a lot of open
guard still like that,

1003
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:40,040
like mural Bustamante
hips are always moving.

1004
00:25:40,041 --> 00:25:41,420
They're just active the whole time.

1005
00:25:41,421 --> 00:25:42,500
When you believe in that or not,

1006
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:44,330
no matter what your school is,

1007
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:47,040
it's active hips and
active fundamentals and,

1008
00:25:47,041 --> 00:25:49,010
and guys have surprising a little of that,

1009
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:49,810
you know,

1010
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:50,900
well Jeeva is my coach.

1011
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:52,160
She was a stud.

1012
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,180
People don't know.

1013
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:57,620
Jake shields just came in and rolled and
Jake always been had an open invitation

1014
00:25:57,621 --> 00:25:59,160
of the gym and he just
shutting up one night.

1015
00:25:59,161 --> 00:25:59,391
I'm like,

1016
00:25:59,391 --> 00:25:59,571
oh,

1017
00:25:59,571 --> 00:26:00,404
what's up dude?

1018
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,313
It's against shit role.

1019
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:02,690
And then after OGV he's like,

1020
00:26:02,691 --> 00:26:04,280
why didn't you tell me
that he was so good?

1021
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:05,270
He was like,

1022
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:05,690
I usually,

1023
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:08,990
I usually come into gyms and I
don't want to embarrass the coach.

1024
00:26:08,991 --> 00:26:09,650
So I really easy.

1025
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:10,483
He's like,

1026
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:11,120
holy cow,

1027
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:11,870
I've never been swept.

1028
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:12,320
Somebody's like,

1029
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:12,800
he was like,

1030
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,221
wow,

1031
00:26:13,221 --> 00:26:13,450
you know,

1032
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:16,130
and Jared Wallins remember
when he up war machine,

1033
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:17,363
it's Jeeva.

1034
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,970
Jeeva is a fuck man.

1035
00:26:19,971 --> 00:26:21,410
It's crazy how good he is.

1036
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,550
All Butterfly Guard,

1037
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,530
a butterfly guy does the everything.

1038
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:25,050
I mean he said,

1039
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,710
but not,

1040
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,460
I wouldn't say rubber guard stuff.

1041
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:30,290
Some of the guys were so good off.

1042
00:26:30,291 --> 00:26:31,030
Is Crazy.

1043
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:31,863
So important.

1044
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,211
I mean,

1045
00:26:32,211 --> 00:26:32,801
and it's,

1046
00:26:32,801 --> 00:26:33,490
it's basic,

1047
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:33,860
you know,

1048
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:36,140
on bark type Jujitsu with a lot of elbows,

1049
00:26:36,141 --> 00:26:36,921
pushing the head out,

1050
00:26:36,921 --> 00:26:38,570
hips out blasts and people,

1051
00:26:38,571 --> 00:26:38,781
you know,

1052
00:26:38,781 --> 00:26:40,610
like trying to create damage.

1053
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:43,680
Who Do you think he's got the
best garden and may right now

1054
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:47,580
fibery show we're doing.

1055
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:51,520
I mean the dude fucking finished fade
or on my years it would have been

1056
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,500
[inaudible] I think.

1057
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,390
I think it's we're past that point.

1058
00:26:54,391 --> 00:26:54,491
Yeah.

1059
00:26:54,491 --> 00:26:56,190
It used to be in his prime and it's oral.

1060
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:57,083
Heavyweight wise.

1061
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,680
I don't Demian Maia has got a great one.

1062
00:26:58,681 --> 00:26:59,100
I don't,

1063
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,630
I don't totally agree with that.

1064
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:04,110
I think [inaudible] a
pad and amazing guard,

1065
00:27:04,111 --> 00:27:05,130
but if you put,

1066
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,450
I believe if you put from BC,

1067
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,590
we're doing the same scenario,

1068
00:27:07,591 --> 00:27:08,790
he would tap those guys quicker.

1069
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:09,390
Really?

1070
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:10,020
Yeah.

1071
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:12,360
I don't think anybody's better
than off their back then Virginia.

1072
00:27:12,361 --> 00:27:13,350
He is outstanding.

1073
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:14,260
He is really grave.

1074
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:14,551
See,

1075
00:27:14,551 --> 00:27:15,384
he's insane.

1076
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,800
The way he keeps his feet on the hips.

1077
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:18,090
We keeps guys moving around.

1078
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:19,380
You watched that fate or fight.

1079
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:22,140
It's not just impressive
the way he submitted him.

1080
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:24,210
It's like the fight was over.

1081
00:27:24,211 --> 00:27:28,310
As soon as he was locked up in
a skosh took it out of mid air.

1082
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:29,400
It wasn't like he fell into it.

1083
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:29,680
I mean,

1084
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,230
Carl never could do that.

1085
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,940
I mean minutes take a line.

1086
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:36,750
He would take a ton of damage and
it gets them and allows them to go,

1087
00:27:36,751 --> 00:27:37,680
is this really worth it?

1088
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,990
You are getting the
years beaten out of you,

1089
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:40,141
man.

1090
00:27:40,141 --> 00:27:40,860
But he didn't,

1091
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:43,170
he couldn't pull it off
in his prime on fader.

1092
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:44,340
Granted,

1093
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,590
fader was in his prime in that
fight and he wasn't in his prime.

1094
00:27:46,591 --> 00:27:47,424
In the boardroom fight.

1095
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:47,880
Yeah,

1096
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,510
but still for doing them.

1097
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,860
I think I just went
just amazing during it.

1098
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:52,950
I think he's the best.

1099
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:54,440
You know who's really good at,

1100
00:27:54,441 --> 00:27:54,620
you know,

1101
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:55,740
it doesn't get a lot of credit for,

1102
00:27:55,741 --> 00:27:57,030
is that Charles Alovera kid?

1103
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:57,550
Yeah.

1104
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,070
It's wicked off his battery.

1105
00:27:59,071 --> 00:27:59,610
Good Guard.

1106
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:01,080
Wicked standing up to men.

1107
00:28:01,081 --> 00:28:01,891
That fight with Frankie.

1108
00:28:01,891 --> 00:28:03,180
Edgar was fucking awesome.

1109
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:04,080
Yeah.

1110
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:04,980
He fought last night,

1111
00:28:04,981 --> 00:28:05,814
right.

1112
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,340
Didn't know.

1113
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:06,940
I didn't see it last.

1114
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:07,470
He fought.

1115
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:08,271
He fought in a,

1116
00:28:08,271 --> 00:28:09,300
on that to Hoonah card.

1117
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,010
Ellenberger wins a decision.

1118
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:12,690
Haufle Ellenberger good for him,

1119
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:13,320
man.

1120
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,040
Good for him.

1121
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:14,730
Let's hope that eyes,

1122
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:15,271
I know,

1123
00:28:15,271 --> 00:28:15,601
man.

1124
00:28:15,601 --> 00:28:16,434
I hope he didn't.

1125
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:21,511
Yeah,

1126
00:28:21,511 --> 00:28:22,830
he fought last night.

1127
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:23,843
I'm

1128
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,380
trying to find the fight card here.

1129
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:33,060
Is the ufc.com not the best
fucking website in the world.

1130
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:36,630
Uh,

1131
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:41,630
he fought hot Sukiyaki and he beat
hot Sukiyaki decision or I don't know.

1132
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,250
I haven't seen it yet.

1133
00:28:44,251 --> 00:28:45,750
We could watch that later.

1134
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:47,250
Shinya Yogi for a lot of years,

1135
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:49,560
I think had the best one
of the best guards in MMA.

1136
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:50,220
Oh fuck.

1137
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,053
Oh my God.

1138
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,650
What do you think about
the tights like that?

1139
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:56,670
That was like the big thing
that he wore tights in pride,

1140
00:28:56,671 --> 00:28:57,990
which are great for traction.

1141
00:28:58,010 --> 00:28:58,290
Yeah.

1142
00:28:58,290 --> 00:29:00,570
But they wouldn't let him wear
it when he fought anywhere else.

1143
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:02,550
I don't really understand that.

1144
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:04,080
He stopped too key.

1145
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,870
It was the first time hot.

1146
00:29:06,871 --> 00:29:07,311
So he oak,

1147
00:29:07,311 --> 00:29:08,800
he got stopped and by the way,

1148
00:29:08,801 --> 00:29:08,921
hey,

1149
00:29:08,921 --> 00:29:13,840
Yo key just a couple of years ago was
thought of as the number one guy had 145

1150
00:29:13,841 --> 00:29:16,450
pounds and uh,

1151
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:19,750
has not done so he got
an arm and guillotine.

1152
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,370
He got them with an army gating.

1153
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,220
The way he cinched it up,

1154
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:26,290
it looks like a lucky,

1155
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:27,700
wrapped it up Dar style.

1156
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,113
Hmm.

1157
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:32,060
Interesting.

1158
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:32,893
Not that long.

1159
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:33,860
No ma'am.

1160
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,660
All three of us in this
room got a little stubby.

1161
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:35,990
Fuck.

1162
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:37,010
Silly monkey arms.

1163
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:37,940
Yeah.

1164
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:39,890
I envy guys like Tony Ferguson,

1165
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,040
those long ass arms.

1166
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:42,790
They,

1167
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:45,130
Tony Darcy's from everywhere.

1168
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:46,710
Bill Cooper Jujitsu.

1169
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:47,560
Oh yeah,

1170
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,041
lock you up.

1171
00:29:48,041 --> 00:29:48,470
You're done.

1172
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:49,303
[inaudible] Gracie.

1173
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:49,471
None.

1174
00:29:49,471 --> 00:29:50,430
That's you acceptable.

1175
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:52,720
Those long arm dudes man.

1176
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:55,630
They just really know how to
get those certain submissions.

1177
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:58,180
That was the worst
spinning back by not good.

1178
00:29:58,930 --> 00:29:59,770
Not good at all.

1179
00:29:59,771 --> 00:30:01,210
Fitting bat buck kick.

1180
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:05,770
But a props to that dude for a taking
that fight on short notice like last

1181
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:05,830
minute.

1182
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:06,880
I think a little prep.

1183
00:30:06,881 --> 00:30:07,301
You might have one.

1184
00:30:07,301 --> 00:30:07,900
That one.

1185
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:08,770
It's a good fight too.

1186
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,060
It was a fun fight.

1187
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,300
Close ass kicked for
the first five minutes.

1188
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:16,030
Fucking I looked pretty bad man.

1189
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:17,530
That I looked real bad.

1190
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,720
So let's see what else we got here.

1191
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,890
What is next?

1192
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:22,210
This fucking fight card.

1193
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:25,480
I'm so excited about this main event.

1194
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:30,610
I know it's real close to your
buddy and I know it's hard for you,

1195
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,470
but I'm excited about this.

1196
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:37,000
I just sometimes I just don't want
to see my friends get beat up course.

1197
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:37,331
Right.

1198
00:30:37,331 --> 00:30:38,290
It makes it understandable.

1199
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,850
I don't mind getting beat up myself.

1200
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:43,840
Yeah,

1201
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,673
I'd rather not.

1202
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:45,641
It's,

1203
00:30:45,641 --> 00:30:46,440
uh,

1204
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:49,660
a lot of guys say that it's harder when
you walk in your teammates up then that

1205
00:30:49,661 --> 00:30:50,860
is when you're walking yourself up.

1206
00:30:50,861 --> 00:30:52,150
Do you feel like that completely.

1207
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:52,381
Yeah,

1208
00:30:52,381 --> 00:30:53,214
cause I,

1209
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:54,280
I just want to go,

1210
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:55,840
I know what I'm doing,

1211
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:56,261
you know,

1212
00:30:56,261 --> 00:30:59,860
I can control what's going on and
usually it ends up pretty well.

1213
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:01,780
So I just,

1214
00:31:01,781 --> 00:31:02,350
uh,

1215
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:02,891
I like it.

1216
00:31:02,891 --> 00:31:03,880
But whether the people,

1217
00:31:03,881 --> 00:31:06,700
it's like sometimes you're
thinking you suck at this,

1218
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:07,930
you suck at that,

1219
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:08,891
don't do that.

1220
00:31:08,891 --> 00:31:10,630
Don't look at me and smile and get thrown.

1221
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:13,090
Like that's the worst

1222
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,930
I have heard in my career
some really horrible coaching.

1223
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:16,650
Oh man,

1224
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:17,580
that stands out to me.

1225
00:31:17,581 --> 00:31:18,900
I think more than anything when you're,

1226
00:31:18,901 --> 00:31:21,060
when you're commentating
in like in between rounds,

1227
00:31:21,061 --> 00:31:21,241
man,

1228
00:31:21,241 --> 00:31:25,440
I know we pay per view and on TV is
very different depending on what you do,

1229
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,930
whether or not we see the routes,

1230
00:31:26,931 --> 00:31:27,151
see the,

1231
00:31:27,151 --> 00:31:29,850
see the coaches in between rounds is
up to the producer and all this stuff.

1232
00:31:29,851 --> 00:31:33,420
So it's a lot of times where I'm sitting
there watching the coach and you know,

1233
00:31:33,421 --> 00:31:35,820
play by play guys doing
something and I'm like,

1234
00:31:35,821 --> 00:31:38,360
that is the worst advice
I have ever heard of.

1235
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:38,840
Like,

1236
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,180
like,

1237
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,860
like they don't know what
they're talking about.

1238
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:41,341
I liked the,

1239
00:31:41,341 --> 00:31:42,420
it'll say the awful,

1240
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:43,500
you will say that though.

1241
00:31:43,501 --> 00:31:44,041
You will say,

1242
00:31:44,041 --> 00:31:44,874
well I'm out man.

1243
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:45,931
Yeah I will.

1244
00:31:45,931 --> 00:31:49,080
I'll call it like they're pissing me
later to add sometimes I've got a couple

1245
00:31:49,081 --> 00:31:52,680
people mad at me but I like that it's
just a word or you're winning this fight

1246
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:53,461
and I'm like,

1247
00:31:53,461 --> 00:31:55,380
what fight are you looking at?

1248
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,460
You are down four rounds to none.

1249
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:59,970
That's never good to lie to you.

1250
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:01,080
Fighter cheerleading.

1251
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,060
Some guy he cheerleading
the McCoy's still.

1252
00:32:03,061 --> 00:32:04,020
Some guys are really,

1253
00:32:04,021 --> 00:32:04,350
you know,

1254
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:05,183
I think he's the best.

1255
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:06,203
Matt Hume.

1256
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,133
Very good.

1257
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,280
He's so specific.

1258
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:11,370
So specific about what's
going on and what,

1259
00:32:11,371 --> 00:32:14,460
what you're doing wrong or what you could
do to make that a little bit better.

1260
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,780
Very technical.

1261
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,200
And then you'll hear other guys where
it's like it's you all day long.

1262
00:32:19,201 --> 00:32:20,100
Put your punches together.

1263
00:32:20,101 --> 00:32:21,870
Like they say a bunch
of shit pushed the pace.

1264
00:32:21,871 --> 00:32:22,700
Like what do you say?

1265
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:23,700
You're not saying anything.

1266
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,120
The worst one,

1267
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:31,130
the worst I remember distinctly was
Bj Penn's corner saying go at him.

1268
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,270
Oh,

1269
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:34,100
for an over,

1270
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:38,340
I think it was actually the Jens Pulver
finds his way back for the old fans and

1271
00:32:38,341 --> 00:32:41,530
they're going go him
Hilo style like 20 times.

1272
00:32:41,531 --> 00:32:44,180
And I went that you're
not saying anything.

1273
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:45,200
It was low style,

1274
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:48,050
but it was like his tenement
had always gotten that far.

1275
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,280
So when it didn't work,

1276
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:50,600
they didn't know what to do.

1277
00:32:50,601 --> 00:32:52,070
It's like we never coached him before.

1278
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:53,300
Why are we going to start now?

1279
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:53,750
It's soup.

1280
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:54,160
It was just,

1281
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,560
I remember laughing mammals too.

1282
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:56,360
Right.

1283
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,210
When you have that dynamic of one guy,

1284
00:32:58,250 --> 00:32:58,800
the Alpha,

1285
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,840
the Super Alpha,

1286
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:00,860
have you been here Jay?

1287
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:01,341
No,

1288
00:33:01,341 --> 00:33:01,941
I've been to Hilo,

1289
00:33:01,941 --> 00:33:03,200
but I've never been to Bj's camp.

1290
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:04,910
I stayed just stayed
at his parents' house.

1291
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:05,863
What does it like?

1292
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:06,890
It's so much fun.

1293
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,330
I would move there if I could.

1294
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:08,811
I love that.

1295
00:33:08,811 --> 00:33:09,420
Beautiful.

1296
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,221
So beautiful.

1297
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:11,054
And it's like a,

1298
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:12,050
it's like the tech,

1299
00:33:12,051 --> 00:33:12,621
the little town.

1300
00:33:12,621 --> 00:33:13,280
My girlfriend was,

1301
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:13,461
you know,

1302
00:33:13,461 --> 00:33:14,294
raised in,

1303
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:15,343
uh,

1304
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,560
like Mindin Nevada Garnerville
like right below Tahoe.

1305
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,330
But it's that Shonda by jungle.

1306
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:25,360
It's a tiny little town and everyone's
cool and you just sit around and go to

1307
00:33:25,641 --> 00:33:26,110
the beach.

1308
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:27,560
But there's a lot of fights.

1309
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:29,330
So isn't there a lot of fist fights?

1310
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,193
Awesome.

1311
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:32,890
Should be getting into fistfights.

1312
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:33,920
You'd tell your daughter that.

1313
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:34,520
Well,

1314
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,980
no shit that girls shouldn't ever site.

1315
00:33:36,981 --> 00:33:37,814
That's disgusting.

1316
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:39,650
But tell say Rudy,

1317
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:43,700
you know about [inaudible]
UFC belt this weekend,

1318
00:33:43,701 --> 00:33:45,740
you might get a fucking text message.

1319
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:46,540
DFW,

1320
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:48,340
understanding how much shit talking again,

1321
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:50,390
I fuck with everybody.

1322
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:51,291
It's Twitter.

1323
00:33:51,291 --> 00:33:54,870
Simmer down and then you get people saying
some nerdy shit like we're Mcdonald's

1324
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:58,040
sent me the wiki links to
two like idiot or something.

1325
00:33:58,041 --> 00:33:58,310
I was like,

1326
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:58,551
oh,

1327
00:33:58,551 --> 00:34:00,140
that's a real good comeback.

1328
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:01,170
What did you do?

1329
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:06,080
Because you said he had never gotten in
a fist fight that the USC is creating

1330
00:34:06,081 --> 00:34:07,650
pussies that I've never been at this one.

1331
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,413
We have the best.

1332
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:10,603
Awesome.

1333
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:14,420
We have the world's best
athletes and like Demetrius,

1334
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:16,430
I doubt he's ever even been
in a fist fight in his life,

1335
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,540
but he beat my ass.

1336
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:19,730
You know,

1337
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:19,900
he,

1338
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:20,541
that second fight,

1339
00:34:20,541 --> 00:34:21,260
he beat me up.

1340
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:24,710
So I'm just saying that a lot of guys,

1341
00:34:24,711 --> 00:34:26,120
they just aren't scary.

1342
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:31,630
Like I comment to go from not scary
to pussy is a pretty big league mean.

1343
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,440
He's not an animal.

1344
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:36,800
You mean like if some shit goes down on
the street he wants to beat the shit out

1345
00:34:36,801 --> 00:34:37,521
of you and then liquids,

1346
00:34:37,521 --> 00:34:38,960
gloves and you know,

1347
00:34:38,961 --> 00:34:40,550
chuck wants to beat the shit
out of you and you know,

1348
00:34:40,551 --> 00:34:41,490
bone your chick.

1349
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:43,851
I just kidding.

1350
00:34:43,851 --> 00:34:45,620
I'm just back in the day.

1351
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,250
But that's who I was raised by,

1352
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:50,031
you know,

1353
00:34:50,031 --> 00:34:53,510
so I have a different outlook on it is
this fucking savages and the guys that

1354
00:34:53,511 --> 00:34:55,370
are just there to be athletic.

1355
00:34:55,371 --> 00:34:56,750
One of the biggest transitions,

1356
00:34:56,890 --> 00:34:57,351
I'm a deck,

1357
00:34:57,351 --> 00:34:57,920
I'm sorry.

1358
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,161
No,

1359
00:34:58,161 --> 00:34:59,780
one of the biggest transitions in mmm,

1360
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:01,460
well the last 10 years has been,

1361
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:04,160
it used to be a sport of
martial arts and fighters.

1362
00:35:04,161 --> 00:35:05,870
Now the support of athletes and I go,

1363
00:35:05,871 --> 00:35:09,230
these guys are at there just stud athletes
who kind of went in that direction.

1364
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:10,640
They didn't grow up going,

1365
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:11,120
you know,

1366
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:14,390
watching bloodsport and wanting
to be that guy or you know,

1367
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,440
getting in fist fights and going,

1368
00:35:15,441 --> 00:35:15,561
gee,

1369
00:35:15,561 --> 00:35:16,380
I'm going to go to jail phone,

1370
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,213
do this for money.

1371
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,110
That breed.

1372
00:35:18,111 --> 00:35:19,520
Those two halves are kind of gone now.

1373
00:35:19,521 --> 00:35:21,770
It's like these crazy good
athletes that kind of grew up.

1374
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:22,321
Yeah.

1375
00:35:22,321 --> 00:35:24,680
I was a cross country runner and I was
football player and I wanted to MMA.

1376
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:25,873
So the,

1377
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,430
I get what you're saying
in the terms of it,

1378
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,230
it's become more of a sport of athletes.

1379
00:35:30,231 --> 00:35:32,570
Have guys with dude just
have athletic backgrounds,

1380
00:35:32,571 --> 00:35:35,450
like never really improved guys who
are really good at other sports.

1381
00:35:35,451 --> 00:35:37,130
Who like Matt Mitrione.

1382
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:37,530
Yeah,

1383
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:37,980
really good

1384
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:38,790
at for freaky ass.

1385
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:42,390
I just having to say things in a
really rude manner as all I gotcha.

1386
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,580
Well you make a point though.

1387
00:35:44,581 --> 00:35:45,930
I see what you're saying and translate.

1388
00:35:45,931 --> 00:35:50,800
I'm a translator and what he
means is stupid and he just goes,

1389
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:52,790
I get my job.

1390
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:56,250
Part of my job I'm Clint
has brought to fight.

1391
00:35:56,251 --> 00:35:59,820
Now he's fighting a Antonio
Braga Braga and Neto.

1392
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,833
And um,

1393
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:02,940
Hester who fights at one 85.

1394
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:04,980
They were just saying on
the underground how we uh,

1395
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,560
he weighed in today at two oh five.

1396
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:08,191
Yeah,

1397
00:36:08,191 --> 00:36:08,830
he's strict.

1398
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:11,310
He's a big fella and
he's a good athlete too.

1399
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:12,420
That's a strong cat.

1400
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:13,351
Hard,

1401
00:36:13,351 --> 00:36:16,140
hard striker and a Neto.

1402
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,400
Who is a,

1403
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:18,930
he's fought in the UFC before.

1404
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:20,190
Um,

1405
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:22,440
I think he's nine and one,

1406
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:26,530
I think he's fought in the
UFC and we look at his,

1407
00:36:26,531 --> 00:36:27,190
um,

1408
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:29,560
cause I know there's some guys
that are making their debuts.

1409
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:32,980
Machito was into that glory fight,

1410
00:36:32,981 --> 00:36:33,340
man.

1411
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,660
It's just a commercial and a sheet on it.

1412
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:35,100
I need them.

1413
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:38,690
Machita said that he was
interested in fighting art 11.

1414
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:39,190
It's

1415
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:40,023
crazy.

1416
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:44,910
I trained with at Don's and he's
probably the best 15 pounder.

1417
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:45,170
You know,

1418
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:47,390
this country's ever
seen two and 12 pounder.

1419
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,600
And when he turns,

1420
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:50,930
when he turns it up,

1421
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,460
Oh my God,

1422
00:36:52,461 --> 00:36:53,870
it is so scary.

1423
00:36:53,871 --> 00:36:56,140
I mean he's the only guy that
they bring ties over and you know,

1424
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:56,690
knock some,

1425
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:57,523
most of them out.

1426
00:36:57,830 --> 00:36:58,663
Now.

1427
00:36:58,730 --> 00:36:59,061
He's,

1428
00:36:59,061 --> 00:36:59,361
he,

1429
00:36:59,361 --> 00:36:59,481
you know,

1430
00:36:59,481 --> 00:37:01,690
he's 112 pound fighter and he hits like,

1431
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:03,320
like a heavyweight.

1432
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:03,700
It's,

1433
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:04,150
it's,

1434
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:04,980
it,

1435
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,080
it's fucking crazy.

1436
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:09,080
He's the only person I'm
afraid of where I'm like,

1437
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:09,681
oh my God,

1438
00:37:09,681 --> 00:37:11,300
you're going to fucking
put me out at any point.

1439
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:11,991
And that's,

1440
00:37:11,991 --> 00:37:12,561
that's high level.

1441
00:37:12,561 --> 00:37:14,030
Kickbox and that's world class kickboxing.

1442
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:15,900
I used to drink with a mallet pet over it.

1443
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,473
You know how scary it is,

1444
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:18,463
dude?

1445
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:19,940
Holy Jesus.

1446
00:37:19,941 --> 00:37:21,650
It was like you got shot by a gun.

1447
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:22,550
It was,

1448
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:23,383
it was,

1449
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,110
yeah,

1450
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:24,561
we were,

1451
00:37:24,561 --> 00:37:27,530
I was getting a guy named Kenny
Johnson who just cornered actually,

1452
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:27,980
uh,

1453
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:28,430
a wrestler.

1454
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:32,090
I was cornering him for a fight out in
orange county somewhere and mallow pet

1455
00:37:32,091 --> 00:37:32,871
was fighting wild man.

1456
00:37:32,871 --> 00:37:35,240
Danny in the main event
and King of the cage.

1457
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:35,930
Yeah.

1458
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:36,763
Something like that.

1459
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,360
And we're,

1460
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:38,631
you know,

1461
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:41,000
they're two separate rooms
and in the room next to us,

1462
00:37:41,001 --> 00:37:43,430
it sounded like someone
was shooting a rifle off.

1463
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,970
Like literally I got up and I
turned and was mallet hitting pads.

1464
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:47,720
Yeah.

1465
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,980
It was ridiculous.

1466
00:37:48,981 --> 00:37:49,814
You get hit you,

1467
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:50,803
it's horrible.

1468
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:51,490
Yeah.

1469
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:52,370
You got guns and Yeltsin,

1470
00:37:52,371 --> 00:37:53,204

we're afraid text Jim affiliate.

1474
00:37:56,811 --> 00:37:56,931
Yeah.

1475
00:37:56,931 --> 00:37:57,764
And it's just,

1476
00:37:58,130 --> 00:37:58,731
Oh my God.

1477
00:37:58,731 --> 00:37:59,564
Or the guy that just,

1478
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,490
he hit Romy was an elbow
like five seconds in just,

1479
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,870
and then all of a sudden started smiling
and pointing and then Romy was like

1480
00:38:05,871 --> 00:38:10,580
fucking turn around and just had this
giant vagina in the front of his head.

1481
00:38:10,581 --> 00:38:11,414
And it was,

1482
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:12,680
I saw a fight.

1483
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:13,970
It was fucking scary.

1484
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:14,270
Yeah,

1485
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:15,103
he's nasty.

1486
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,190
He's nasty.

1487
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:16,941
Like super bond.

1488
00:38:16,941 --> 00:38:17,840
And those little tie guys,

1489
00:38:17,841 --> 00:38:18,291
I mean they're,

1490
00:38:18,291 --> 00:38:19,100
they're like,

1491
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,330
they want us to go out there and I'm like,

1492
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,210
I don't fucking,

1493
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:24,260
then those guys hardly ever spar.

1494
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,153
They don't talk.

1495
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:26,391
They feel safe.

1496
00:38:26,391 --> 00:38:30,530
They fail 300 times by the time they're
25 which is just absolutely incredible.

1497
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:31,510
If you've ever been a ton.

1498
00:38:31,511 --> 00:38:33,470
And it's really weird when
they have a five round fight,

1499
00:38:33,471 --> 00:38:35,740
they don't fight in the first round
because they're feeling each other out.

1500
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:38,500
They kill each other rounds two,

1501
00:38:38,501 --> 00:38:40,480
three and four and they don't
fight in the fifth round.

1502
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:41,913
They carry each other.

1503
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,210
And I asked my coaches time,

1504
00:38:43,211 --> 00:38:43,871
I was training Tamika,

1505
00:38:43,871 --> 00:38:44,261
why did they do it?

1506
00:38:44,261 --> 00:38:44,650
And he goes,

1507
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:45,520
you fight next week.

1508
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:46,720
There's no point.

1509
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,700
We already know who won
basically on the cards,

1510
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:50,560
so why would you destroy your body?

1511
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:51,700
You got to fight and like a week.

1512
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:52,150
Why?

1513
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:53,770
They just don't give us
just a little a fifth round.

1514
00:38:53,771 --> 00:38:54,011
It's like,

1515
00:38:54,011 --> 00:38:54,221
all right,

1516
00:38:54,221 --> 00:38:54,821
I know you once.

1517
00:38:54,821 --> 00:38:55,550
Let's just,

1518
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:56,660
and a lot of rambling stuff,

1519
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:57,670
lot of gambling.

1520
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:59,950
That is so interesting that they do that.

1521
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:01,380
Do you think that tie,

1522
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:01,960
um,

1523
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:02,950
decisions are better?

1524
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:06,010
They're better at making decisions
because that's the big issue in MMA.

1525
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:08,260
It's like don't leave it
in the hands of the judges,

1526
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:09,900
which I hate to,

1527
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:11,080
I hate that expression.

1528
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:11,790
Yeah.

1529
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:12,170
We have a,

1530
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:13,660
we have one of my least favorite Shitty,

1531
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:14,181
you know,

1532
00:39:14,181 --> 00:39:15,014
judging system.

1533
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:15,310
Yeah,

1534
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:16,031
we need to change,

1535
00:39:16,031 --> 00:39:17,560
but how are we going
to change it and fuck,

1536
00:39:17,561 --> 00:39:17,890
I don't,

1537
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:18,191
right.

1538
00:39:18,191 --> 00:39:20,890
There's so many options and the people
have so many ideas and they all seem

1539
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:21,461
okay,

1540
00:39:21,461 --> 00:39:23,080
but there's always holes in them and yeah,

1541
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:26,740
you get bad decisions in boxing that's
been around for a hundred years and you

1542
00:39:26,741 --> 00:39:28,840
have 12 rounds and you
get horrible decisions.

1543
00:39:28,841 --> 00:39:32,410
Remember that one woman out there was
one woman who was a boxing judge who uh,

1544
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:34,150
she judged a Bradley.

1545
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:35,170
We let the over pack.

1546
00:39:35,171 --> 00:39:35,860
Yeah,

1547
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:37,780
I remember she also called the main,

1548
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,220
whether it hurts another one.

1549
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:40,680
May what the Mayweather,

1550
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:41,553
uh,

1551
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:42,340
the Mayweather fight,

1552
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:43,270
she called it a draw me.

1553
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,110
Hello?

1554
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:44,630
Hello.

1555
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:44,940
Yeah.

1556
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:45,701
And everybody was like,

1557
00:39:45,701 --> 00:39:48,730
what the fuck was so bad that they
brought in the Nevada state governor?

1558
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,390
They kicked her out.

1559
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:49,600
Yeah.

1560
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,520
They kicked her out and they brought
in the divided state governor.

1561
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:51,841
And the,

1562
00:39:51,841 --> 00:39:55,900
the real concern amongst people in the
know was that she might be getting paid

1563
00:39:55,901 --> 00:39:56,800
off by gamblers.

1564
00:39:57,010 --> 00:39:58,050
That a gambler who,

1565
00:39:58,110 --> 00:39:59,890
who wanted to ensure,

1566
00:39:59,891 --> 00:40:01,930
like if you've got a fight where you know,

1567
00:40:01,931 --> 00:40:04,810
a guy who's going to win by decision
like Floyd Mayweather vs Canelo,

1568
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:08,170
you could safely bet a lot
of money knowing the flow.

1569
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:08,381
I mean,

1570
00:40:08,381 --> 00:40:09,280
shit can happen.

1571
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:09,520
Yeah.

1572
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,390
Canelo can win,

1573
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:14,290
but most likely you're going to see
Floyd boxes face off most likely.

1574
00:40:14,291 --> 00:40:15,190
And that is what happened.

1575
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:17,110
But she didn't see it that way.

1576
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:21,200
And she makes it a draw and then it's
not a majority to sit or now it's on

1577
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:22,330
unanimous decision.

1578
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,300
You could bet against it not
being in a unanimous decision.

1579
00:40:25,301 --> 00:40:25,510
Yeah.

1580
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:26,900
Big Vegas Elbow.

1581
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:28,163
Yeah.

1582
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:29,111
And so,

1583
00:40:29,111 --> 00:40:29,231
uh,

1584
00:40:29,231 --> 00:40:29,650
okay.

1585
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:33,610
Braga versus Hester and Braga
does have one fight in the,

1586
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:34,361
or Neto rather.

1587
00:40:34,361 --> 00:40:37,330
He does have one fight in
the UFC and he's got a,

1588
00:40:37,331 --> 00:40:37,991
he's got a victory.

1589
00:40:37,991 --> 00:40:39,700
He fought on the under card.

1590
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:40,571
Yeah.

1591
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:41,650
I've seen Hester fight.

1592
00:40:41,651 --> 00:40:42,640
And this is his style,

1593
00:40:42,641 --> 00:40:45,730
that athletic hands down
kind of explosive style,

1594
00:40:45,731 --> 00:40:48,040
but it's getting caught by the left a lot.

1595
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:52,030
Mr It's a BC that they do not look
like they're in the same weight class.

1596
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:52,731
Yeah.

1597
00:40:52,731 --> 00:40:53,600
He's enormous.

1598
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,120
That's cut.

1599
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:55,491
And that,

1600
00:40:55,491 --> 00:40:57,430
wait baby cutting that,

1601
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:57,681
wait.

1602
00:40:57,681 --> 00:40:58,514
It works.

1603
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:04,060
I like seeing are that our
new bantamweight champions,

1604
00:41:04,061 --> 00:41:04,894
uh,

1605
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:05,710
doesn't cut much weight.

1606
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:06,543
It doesn't seem like he does.

1607
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:07,211
No,

1608
00:41:07,211 --> 00:41:08,680
I don't think he cuts wants weight at all.

1609
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:09,510
Tj.

1610
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:09,791
Uh,

1611
00:41:09,791 --> 00:41:10,870
I think at the most,

1612
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:12,040
a couple of pounds.

1613
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:12,401
Yeah.

1614
00:41:12,401 --> 00:41:13,090
He's a beast.

1615
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:16,780
And that's a perfect example of finding
the right teacher and the right pupil.

1616
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:17,110
Yeah,

1617
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:19,870
him and Dwayne just fucking gel together.

1618
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:21,250
And Dwayne is a,

1619
00:41:21,251 --> 00:41:22,360
just a total madman.

1620
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,250
So Neto is a,

1621
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:25,840
he's a world champion,

1622
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:26,710
uh,

1623
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:27,281
under,

1624
00:41:27,281 --> 00:41:27,790
uh,

1625
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:28,630
under Gordo.

1626
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:29,860
Is this,

1627
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:30,611
does it evolve?

1628
00:41:30,611 --> 00:41:33,950
MMA in Brazil evolves,

1629
00:41:33,951 --> 00:41:34,784
uh,

1630
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:35,660
the,

1631
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:36,590
the rich guys.

1632
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:37,453
Jim,

1633
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:38,281
I do not know.

1634
00:41:38,281 --> 00:41:39,620
And then that's the one
in Singapore I think.

1635
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:41,240
Let's see.

1636
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,890
I've treated the all in Singapore

1637
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:45,283
when we were out.

1638
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:45,481
Yeah,

1639
00:41:45,481 --> 00:41:45,810
you're right.

1640
00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:46,860
Chattery dancing classes.

1641
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,230
You'll dogs sit the Diane,

1642
00:41:49,830 --> 00:41:50,341
I loved it.

1643
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:51,900
All these rich rich dudes are doing that.

1644
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:57,070
Like these crazy guys like Dan Lambert
from American top team and the guy that

1645
00:41:57,330 --> 00:41:58,051
did it over it,

1646
00:41:58,051 --> 00:41:59,040
a black zillions.

1647
00:41:59,041 --> 00:42:01,860
I loved these guys are doing
that and they're the same thing.

1648
00:42:01,861 --> 00:42:04,110
He would Texas to teen takedown.

1649
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:04,680
Yeah.

1650
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,150
You know all of the wrestlers.

1651
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:07,003
Yeah.

1652
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:08,630
Those motherfuckers,

1653
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:08,850
they,

1654
00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:09,780
those guys get paid.

1655
00:42:09,781 --> 00:42:10,860
They get like a salary.

1656
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:15,360
You get these rich dudes that nice
fine animals like Johnny Hendricks.

1657
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:16,740
They find these fucking animals.

1658
00:42:16,741 --> 00:42:18,240
Give them a world class facility,

1659
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,800
hire world class coaches,

1660
00:42:19,801 --> 00:42:22,560
guys like mark layman to go out
there and teach them Jujitsu.

1661
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:26,220
Great striking coaches and wrestling
coaches and just build world champions.

1662
00:42:26,221 --> 00:42:27,054
Man,

1663
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:28,350
they have a weird deal too,

1664
00:42:28,351 --> 00:42:29,340
like the word,

1665
00:42:29,341 --> 00:42:32,010
like they give up like 50%
of their purse to the gym.

1666
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:34,500
Like the gym pays for everything,

1667
00:42:34,501 --> 00:42:35,580
gives them a salary,

1668
00:42:35,581 --> 00:42:36,414
takes care of everything.

1669
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:37,310
But then they get a,

1670
00:42:37,310 --> 00:42:39,260
the gym gets a big cut of their,

1671
00:42:39,261 --> 00:42:39,890
they're winning.

1672
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:43,010
Now I want to bring up something
that we're in the right,

1673
00:42:43,011 --> 00:42:46,280
well we have the right peoples slick
this guy and he's putting pressure on,

1674
00:42:46,281 --> 00:42:47,010
it's not letting him up.

1675
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:47,843
Yeah.

1676
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:48,990
That,

1677
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:49,761
that system,

1678
00:42:49,761 --> 00:42:50,541
that situation.

1679
00:42:50,541 --> 00:42:53,300
There's a fighter that will
remain nameless and we were like,

1680
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:56,000
he had kind of plateaued and we said,

1681
00:42:56,001 --> 00:42:56,151
you know,

1682
00:42:56,151 --> 00:42:56,570
you should,

1683
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:57,201
you should move on.

1684
00:42:57,201 --> 00:42:58,490
I don't think your Jim's
doing it right for you.

1685
00:42:58,491 --> 00:42:58,761
You know,

1686
00:42:58,761 --> 00:42:59,020
like,

1687
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:01,160
I'm just as a friend and he went,

1688
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,690
they're paying me a salary.

1689
00:43:02,691 --> 00:43:03,620
I really can't leave.

1690
00:43:03,621 --> 00:43:03,840
Like,

1691
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:04,310
Ooh.

1692
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:04,701
He was like,

1693
00:43:04,701 --> 00:43:06,230
I can't afford to walk away.

1694
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:09,680
They're paying me too much to
leave and find the right gym.

1695
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:10,821
And it was interesting.

1696
00:43:10,821 --> 00:43:11,150
I was like,

1697
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:11,660
yeah man.

1698
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:13,250
That system where it's,

1699
00:43:13,251 --> 00:43:13,471
you know,

1700
00:43:13,471 --> 00:43:13,600
if,

1701
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:17,090
if you're not fighting for your purse
and a guy's paying you a salary,

1702
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:19,220
but you're not getting the train you need,

1703
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:20,690
could he keep you somewhere?

1704
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:21,141
That's the,

1705
00:43:21,141 --> 00:43:22,820
I think maybe the downside
of that kind of system,

1706
00:43:22,821 --> 00:43:23,600
you're kind of tied to it.

1707
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:24,070
Yeah.

1708
00:43:24,070 --> 00:43:27,560
That could be the downside to that system
if the guy's not fully committed to,

1709
00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:28,510
to his athletes.

1710
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:28,820
Now,

1711
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:28,990
I mean,

1712
00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:31,090
I think that's an all in
sort of a proposition.

1713
00:43:31,091 --> 00:43:32,680
If you're going to start
that kind of a big gym,

1714
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:33,431
you gotta,

1715
00:43:33,431 --> 00:43:34,900
you gotta be fully committed to your,

1716
00:43:34,901 --> 00:43:35,650
it's your athletes

1717
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:37,060
and you're going to pay
for whatever they want,

1718
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:38,290
whatever coach they want.

1719
00:43:38,291 --> 00:43:39,220
If it's someone's not good enough,

1720
00:43:39,221 --> 00:43:39,970
I'm going to say it.

1721
00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:40,640
Yeah.

1722
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,010
If I'm beating up one of my coaches,

1723
00:43:42,011 --> 00:43:42,480
I'm going to be like,

1724
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,090
ah,

1725
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:43,570
I'm good.

1726
00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:45,160
I wonder what happened with Kenny Monday.

1727
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:46,361
You know,

1728
00:43:46,361 --> 00:43:46,731
cause he,

1729
00:43:46,731 --> 00:43:48,160
when he left the black Zillions,

1730
00:43:48,330 --> 00:43:48,720
yeah.

1731
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:51,670
I mean you can't get a better
wrestling coach in that guy there.

1732
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:52,613
They fired him.

1733
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:54,131
Well this fight,

1734
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:55,660
this is the kind of pressure
we were talking about,

1735
00:43:55,661 --> 00:43:55,841
Joe,

1736
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:57,260
that you don't see a whole lot in MMA.

1737
00:43:57,670 --> 00:43:58,990
He's got really good positioning,

1738
00:43:58,991 --> 00:43:59,824
really good pressure.

1739
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:01,360
He looked to the referee.

1740
00:44:01,570 --> 00:44:01,990
That's,

1741
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:03,490
that's shit is getting annoying.

1742
00:44:03,491 --> 00:44:06,000
That looking through the
referee to come meet him.

1743
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:06,711
He's out.

1744
00:44:06,711 --> 00:44:07,301
He's out.

1745
00:44:07,301 --> 00:44:07,871
He's out.

1746
00:44:07,871 --> 00:44:08,700
That's my favorite.

1747
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:09,110
Yeah,

1748
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:09,870
the guys and the good.

1749
00:44:09,870 --> 00:44:12,070
And you're saying he's out and they
stopped the fight and he's awake.

1750
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:13,383
That's off.

1751
00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:17,160
Do you remember that Yoshida Hoists
Gracie fight where he pretended that hoist

1752
00:44:17,161 --> 00:44:17,520
was out?

1753
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:18,353
Yup.

1754
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:20,050
And Noyce was fine.

1755
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,950
Mack Danzig versus uh,

1756
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:22,840
who got him into QT.

1757
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,260
Matt Wyman and cities.

1758
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:25,113
That's right.

1759
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,033
That's right.

1760
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:27,790
Yup.

1761
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:28,870
He wasn't out at all.

1762
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,273
I mean,

1763
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:31,660
yeah,

1764
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:32,190
but that's

1765
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:33,300
easy to tell though.

1766
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:35,940
A graph or that's easy
to tell if a guy's out.

1767
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:37,260
That's unexcusable.

1768
00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:39,210
That's an uneducated judge.

1769
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:42,870
Kaye o's are weird like earlier today.

1770
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:43,430
Um,

1771
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:44,050
oh no.

1772
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:44,883
On the old,

1773
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:45,810
a nice arm trap.

1774
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:49,950
I love seeing good Jujitsu and MMA.

1775
00:44:49,951 --> 00:44:50,490
I really do.

1776
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:51,323
Johnny Bedford,

1777
00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:52,560
pretty heavy.

1778
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:53,161
Heavy hips,

1779
00:44:53,161 --> 00:44:53,430
man.

1780
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:55,770
Johnny Bedford got fucked
over earlier today for that.

1781
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,480
He got nailed with a punch.

1782
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,060
Went down and you know he got rocked.

1783
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:00,630
It got,

1784
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:04,620
but the referee stopped the fight and
immediately and you know he got up like

1785
00:45:04,621 --> 00:45:05,560
what the fuck?

1786
00:45:05,561 --> 00:45:06,690
Screaming and yelling.

1787
00:45:06,691 --> 00:45:07,524
This is bullshit.

1788
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:09,030
Clearly not wobbly.

1789
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:09,910
Told him,

1790
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:10,953
yeah,

1791
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:11,641
don't touch him,

1792
00:45:11,641 --> 00:45:12,474
don't us.

1793
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:13,920
Don't push.

1794
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:14,400
We're talking.

1795
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,980
The reason why we're saying
that is fucking Jason High Man,

1796
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:18,150
Baby Push.

1797
00:45:18,151 --> 00:45:21,120
It was nothing freaking out
that the fight got stopped.

1798
00:45:21,121 --> 00:45:22,290
He freaks out in the moment.

1799
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:23,550
Touches the referee,

1800
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:26,820
banned for life from the UFC
and suspended for a year,

1801
00:45:26,821 --> 00:45:28,560
which I disagree with it.

1802
00:45:28,610 --> 00:45:30,690
I think the referee,

1803
00:45:30,691 --> 00:45:33,840
that's one thing you think of
Ronda Rousey pushed the referee.

1804
00:45:33,841 --> 00:45:37,430
They would have that same
reaction as what are the risks?

1805
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:38,820
What if Rhonda Rousey lost?

1806
00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:39,450
Okay,

1807
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:39,751
what if,

1808
00:45:39,751 --> 00:45:41,360
let's say some crazy shit happened.

1809
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:43,290
Some Liz Carmouche style.

1810
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:45,330
Remember when Liz had run his back would,

1811
00:45:45,331 --> 00:45:48,540
if someone sinks that in and really
fucking locks it up and clamps it down and

1812
00:45:48,541 --> 00:45:52,530
Rhonda goes out or rotted taps or the
referee thinks that Ron has got a tap and

1813
00:45:52,531 --> 00:45:56,280
the referee stopped the fight and then
Ronnie fucking freaks out and pushes the

1814
00:45:56,281 --> 00:45:57,114
referee,

1815
00:45:57,210 --> 00:45:58,043
what would happen?

1816
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:00,570
Would it be the same because
it's a woman doing it?

1817
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:01,051
Would it be,

1818
00:46:01,051 --> 00:46:01,410
I mean,

1819
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:01,780
Jason,

1820
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:02,790
I didn't hurt anybody.

1821
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:03,540
You know,

1822
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:04,800
it has nothing to do with being a woman.

1823
00:46:04,801 --> 00:46:08,760
And then I see the
point of zero tolerance.

1824
00:46:08,761 --> 00:46:09,241
Don't push.

1825
00:46:09,241 --> 00:46:10,074
Don't touch the restroom.

1826
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,140
I don't.

1827
00:46:11,150 --> 00:46:11,941
I totally do too,

1828
00:46:11,941 --> 00:46:15,210
but I totally get your point
as to if Rhonda did that,

1829
00:46:15,211 --> 00:46:16,230
would they have the same reaction?

1830
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:17,730
Find Him.

1831
00:46:17,730 --> 00:46:19,200
Find him $1,000.

1832
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:19,830
Okay,

1833
00:46:19,830 --> 00:46:21,210
that sounds right to me.

1834
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:21,810
I think it's,

1835
00:46:21,810 --> 00:46:23,760
they took 19 hundreds and a year.

1836
00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:24,810
They took 10% well,

1837
00:46:24,811 --> 00:46:26,730
the 10% is a good amount.

1838
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:27,773
That's good.

1839
00:46:28,170 --> 00:46:29,100
Don't do that.

1840
00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:30,330
Don't touch the referee now.

1841
00:46:30,331 --> 00:46:31,920
You know the referee fucked up.

1842
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:32,580
Yes,

1843
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:34,350
but it was pretty God damn clothes.

1844
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:35,333
You got hurt.

1845
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:36,540
He got hurt pretty bad.

1846
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:37,620
Don't touch the referee,

1847
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:38,940
but God damn it.

1848
00:46:38,941 --> 00:46:39,640
You don't,

1849
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:40,050
I don't,

1850
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:40,361
I just,

1851
00:46:40,361 --> 00:46:41,790
I think Jason has a good guy.

1852
00:46:42,330 --> 00:46:43,290
I've known him,

1853
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:43,711
you know,

1854
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:43,981
I've,

1855
00:46:43,981 --> 00:46:44,281
I've,

1856
00:46:44,281 --> 00:46:45,180
I've talked to him,

1857
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:46,230
I think he's a good guy.

1858
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:47,400
I liked the way he fights.

1859
00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:48,630
He's a good fighter.

1860
00:46:49,090 --> 00:46:51,540
It sucks to me to see a
guy like that get banned.

1861
00:46:51,541 --> 00:46:52,020
But,

1862
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:53,730
but I see it on from their point of view.

1863
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:53,910
You,

1864
00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:54,121
you know,

1865
00:46:54,121 --> 00:46:57,750
you've got to set a zero tolerance
policy to any shenanigans.

1866
00:46:57,990 --> 00:46:58,531
That's why,

1867
00:46:58,531 --> 00:46:59,130
I mean,

1868
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:01,200
look at Semtex Paul Daley.

1869
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,790
So fucking bad.

1870
00:47:02,791 --> 00:47:06,570
Motherfucker like one of the best at one
71 of the most exciting guys to watch,

1871
00:47:06,571 --> 00:47:07,150
that's for sure.

1872
00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:10,770
Took a fucking sucker punch at Josh
Koscheck and he's been gone ever since.

1873
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:12,900
And Dag Dan [inaudible] on a sucker.

1874
00:47:12,901 --> 00:47:14,760
If I hit him up like a toy dude,

1875
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:16,890
I'll never forget that night.

1876
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:17,650
Like principal,

1877
00:47:17,650 --> 00:47:20,820
you'd pick up a dog that
bit you like a pug and what?

1878
00:47:20,821 --> 00:47:22,350
God Damn it and like shook him.

1879
00:47:22,430 --> 00:47:22,980
Know that.

1880
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:24,120
Oh my God.

1881
00:47:24,121 --> 00:47:26,610
Has it been big giant man,

1882
00:47:26,611 --> 00:47:28,440
big boy and a very nice guy too.

1883
00:47:28,610 --> 00:47:29,140
He's a great,

1884
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:30,540
like Dan [inaudible].

1885
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:33,490
He used to get a a hard time from a
lot of people because he was one of the

1886
00:47:33,491 --> 00:47:38,491
original referees for elite Xc and
elite Xc had some dog shit rules.

1887
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:43,210
They were trying to stand people up
after 15 seconds like Jake shields cut

1888
00:47:43,211 --> 00:47:46,480
Semtex and elite ECC with an
arm bar and it was like he was,

1889
00:47:46,810 --> 00:47:50,080
he was running to get that arm
bar before they stood him up.

1890
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:52,210
If you were a grappler in elite x,

1891
00:47:52,211 --> 00:47:52,810
Z,

1892
00:47:52,810 --> 00:47:53,111
boy,

1893
00:47:53,111 --> 00:47:54,940
you were at a fucking bad place.

1894
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,410
You were in a big country,

1895
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:59,530
had Andre Arlovski on the
ground inside control,

1896
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:03,190
double wrist lock working the Komora
and they stand them up and you're like,

1897
00:48:03,191 --> 00:48:04,000
why?

1898
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:04,481
I remember that.

1899
00:48:04,481 --> 00:48:06,670
I can side control the Camorra.

1900
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:07,721
Stand them up,

1901
00:48:07,721 --> 00:48:08,410
stand them up.

1902
00:48:08,410 --> 00:48:09,280
That fat fuck.

1903
00:48:09,281 --> 00:48:10,240
Who was that fucking guy?

1904
00:48:10,241 --> 00:48:11,074
That promoter?

1905
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:12,860
That's sloppy Jello face.

1906
00:48:12,930 --> 00:48:13,763
Motherfucker.

1907
00:48:16,050 --> 00:48:18,010
Don't even say his name and he's like,

1908
00:48:18,011 --> 00:48:18,501
fucking,

1909
00:48:18,501 --> 00:48:19,270
he's Candyman.

1910
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:20,103
He'll show up.

1911
00:48:20,410 --> 00:48:22,660
Oh that fucking gross person.

1912
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:27,730
Those guys ruined MMA for a while and
they got on show the gun on CBS with that

1913
00:48:27,731 --> 00:48:28,150
Shit.

1914
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:29,590
It's amazing how far they got with it.

1915
00:48:29,591 --> 00:48:33,370
When you think about it
so far as idiots so far.

1916
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:34,270
Meanwhile,

1917
00:48:34,270 --> 00:48:35,320
we're watching an awesome fight.

1918
00:48:37,590 --> 00:48:41,320
Soaps coming back in the second row there
in the second round and Braga extended

1919
00:48:41,321 --> 00:48:44,200
a lot of energy trying to get Hester
to the ground and try to submit them,

1920
00:48:44,201 --> 00:48:45,130
but couldn't submit him.

1921
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:47,510
And now Hester stuffs that takedown.

1922
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:48,460
Super easy.

1923
00:48:49,690 --> 00:48:49,990
Okay.

1924
00:48:49,990 --> 00:48:51,100
It's a big athletic person.

1925
00:48:51,101 --> 00:48:51,934
Yeah man.

1926
00:48:51,990 --> 00:48:52,823
Look,

1927
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:54,880
look at this as to take him down.

1928
00:48:54,881 --> 00:48:55,900
Beautiful.

1929
00:48:56,190 --> 00:48:57,023
I don't,

1930
00:48:57,220 --> 00:48:57,981
we'll see how it's not.

1931
00:48:57,981 --> 00:48:59,610
It seems like probably a bad idea.

1932
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:01,570
Look at that deep half
both legs locked up.

1933
00:49:01,930 --> 00:49:03,310
That's sweet.

1934
00:49:03,311 --> 00:49:05,170
That's a beautiful nice.

1935
00:49:05,590 --> 00:49:06,520
Oh my God.

1936
00:49:06,521 --> 00:49:07,354
I love that.

1937
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:09,280
Both legs locked up in the deep half.

1938
00:49:09,281 --> 00:49:10,270
You're in fucking trouble,

1939
00:49:10,271 --> 00:49:10,481
man.

1940
00:49:10,481 --> 00:49:11,920
You've got to explode to get out of that.

1941
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:15,520
Is this nettle full mountain now?

1942
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:17,830
That was gorgeous.

1943
00:49:18,430 --> 00:49:19,450
I love seeing shit like that.

1944
00:49:19,451 --> 00:49:20,170
I really do.

1945
00:49:20,170 --> 00:49:21,070
I don't see enough of it.

1946
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:24,070
You don't mean you got like jock array.

1947
00:49:24,071 --> 00:49:25,150
Damien Maia,

1948
00:49:25,210 --> 00:49:25,811
this guy.

1949
00:49:25,811 --> 00:49:28,360
You've got like a few worldclass guys.

1950
00:49:28,361 --> 00:49:30,850
If y'all know Fernandez
one the best for sure.

1951
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:32,860
Okay.

1952
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:34,450
Few worldclass guys,

1953
00:49:36,190 --> 00:49:37,023
but man,

1954
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:37,691
it has to.

1955
00:49:37,691 --> 00:49:38,980
It has got to be bummed out.

1956
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:40,300
He now he's all gift wrapped.

1957
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:44,290
That's a sucky spot and he's doing that
thing where you stick your thumb inside

1958
00:49:44,291 --> 00:49:44,770
the glove.

1959
00:49:44,770 --> 00:49:44,981
Ooh,

1960
00:49:44,981 --> 00:49:46,240
right in front of everybody.

1961
00:49:48,070 --> 00:49:48,401
I know.

1962
00:49:48,401 --> 00:49:49,330
We can see you right.

1963
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:51,250
He was barely doing it though.

1964
00:49:51,251 --> 00:49:52,084
His defense.

1965
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:54,070
But you can use your own gloves.

1966
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:55,630
You know who uses his own God?

1967
00:49:55,631 --> 00:49:57,160
Josh Thomson does that real well.

1968
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:01,390
He'll get like a rear naked or a gay
teen and get his hands deep in his own

1969
00:50:01,391 --> 00:50:01,661
glove.

1970
00:50:01,661 --> 00:50:02,200
That's nice.

1971
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,840
That's a nice grip and I let,

1972
00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:05,050
I guess you're at least,

1973
00:50:05,051 --> 00:50:08,080
you used to be allowed to
do that with your gloves,

1974
00:50:08,290 --> 00:50:09,760
but you can't do it with
your opponents gloves.

1975
00:50:09,761 --> 00:50:11,840
Just sort of like you
can grab your shorts,

1976
00:50:11,870 --> 00:50:15,660
can't grab the other guy shorts to
protect you like a Kamora like ims Cotita.

1977
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:17,320
He did that for like 20 minutes

1978
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:20,890
for the old school fence.

1979
00:50:21,070 --> 00:50:22,600
Old School son.

1980
00:50:23,650 --> 00:50:24,910
I was there for the original guy,

1981
00:50:24,911 --> 00:50:25,960
Metzger Tito fight.

1982
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:30,050
We're guy Metsker getting fucked up in
Hamilton and they checked him for cuts.

1983
00:50:30,051 --> 00:50:32,660
They go back in Toledo shoots and
guy caught him in a good team.

1984
00:50:33,590 --> 00:50:36,470
I had a fight last season
where a guy had his,

1985
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:39,830
was back mounted through
a headbutt backwards.

1986
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:42,230
I saw that point and they stood him up.

1987
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:43,190
Ridiculous.

1988
00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:43,851
I went,

1989
00:50:43,851 --> 00:50:45,500
what the fuck is this?

1990
00:50:45,501 --> 00:50:46,071
Ridiculous?

1991
00:50:46,071 --> 00:50:47,540
And I was so glad that you did.

1992
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:49,860
I would have been a dude.

1993
00:50:49,861 --> 00:50:50,810
Stick it out of that.

1994
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:51,890
I'll take a point away.

1995
00:50:51,891 --> 00:50:52,724
This is Renee.

1996
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:53,380
Good show.

1997
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:54,640
I'm so happy.

1998
00:50:54,650 --> 00:50:57,160
I was furious that you
do commentary like that.

1999
00:50:57,161 --> 00:51:00,260
Do you call guys out on that and
you don't just let that shit go.

2000
00:51:00,261 --> 00:51:01,550
I love that you do that.

2001
00:51:01,730 --> 00:51:02,670
I can't wait.

2002
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:03,590
Of course you can't look at this.

2003
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:04,280
Meanwhile,

2004
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:06,560
Neto on top in half guard,

2005
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:07,731
Joe Rigs,

2006
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:09,200
Matt Hughes in Half Guard.

2007
00:51:09,201 --> 00:51:09,960
You can get this.

2008
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:10,080
Uh,

2009
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:10,990
he let it go though.

2010
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:11,600
Decided look,

2011
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:11,721
oh,

2012
00:51:11,721 --> 00:51:12,080
that was him.

2013
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:12,320
The route,

2014
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:15,260
because he knows how much to commit to
it and a lot of guys don't because you

2015
00:51:15,261 --> 00:51:16,180
don't come off from half courts.

2016
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:16,580
Tough.

2017
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:17,150
It's tough.

2018
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:18,410
Especially the guys got a good half guard.

2019
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:22,220
Unless you like knowing where to put a
character in one of those big country

2020
00:51:22,221 --> 00:51:23,360
strong motherfuckers.

2021
00:51:23,390 --> 00:51:24,140
You know,

2022
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:26,270
Matt Hughes could just Yank
that shit off your body,

2023
00:51:26,290 --> 00:51:27,230
but it's also the hip thing.

2024
00:51:27,231 --> 00:51:30,080
You have to have know how high you have
to be up with your hips and lot of guys

2025
00:51:30,081 --> 00:51:30,914
just don't know.

2026
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:31,640
I know.

2027
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:32,120
Yup.

2028
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:32,720
Yeah.

2029
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:35,120
It's interesting that
the level of Jujitsu,

2030
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:37,640
but it's also interesting
level striking and MMA.

2031
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:40,880
The problem within the May is
that there's so much to learn.

2032
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:43,670
If you're an athlete and
you're getting into MMA,

2033
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:44,690
see like a lot of these guys,

2034
00:51:44,691 --> 00:51:46,970
like maybe in your thirties and the MMA,

2035
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:48,021
God damn,

2036
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:48,980
there's a learning curve.

2037
00:51:49,010 --> 00:51:50,300
There's so much to learn.

2038
00:51:50,301 --> 00:51:55,130
There's so much to this sport that
you're seeing sort of like you don't see

2039
00:51:55,370 --> 00:51:58,130
class anything in most fighters.

2040
00:51:58,131 --> 00:52:00,260
You see they're really
good at a couple of things.

2041
00:52:00,410 --> 00:52:03,170
But when you see a guy who's
worldclass like as like an ardent,

2042
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:05,880
if art and 11 started fighting in MMA,

2043
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:06,230
right?

2044
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:09,590
The big thing would be talking about
this guy striking for sure because he's

2045
00:52:09,591 --> 00:52:11,570
world class as a kickboxer.

2046
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:15,590
And if you'd compare his
striking to most guys in MMA,

2047
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:16,161
you know,

2048
00:52:16,161 --> 00:52:18,710
outside of the guys who really stand out,

2049
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:19,161
you know,

2050
00:52:19,161 --> 00:52:19,491
you go,

2051
00:52:19,491 --> 00:52:20,390
well that's just some,

2052
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:22,310
that's that's what it
really should look like.

2053
00:52:22,330 --> 00:52:23,060
Yeah.

2054
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:28,010
But for every fighter of a particular
discipline that goes into MMA with a ton

2055
00:52:28,011 --> 00:52:28,844
of credentials,

2056
00:52:28,970 --> 00:52:30,080
who you got as a blue chip,

2057
00:52:30,081 --> 00:52:31,190
this guy's got to do well,

2058
00:52:31,250 --> 00:52:32,570
I can point out somebody who,

2059
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:33,920
same thing tanked.

2060
00:52:34,070 --> 00:52:34,550
That's true.

2061
00:52:34,550 --> 00:52:36,650
You just can't tell anymore where Intel,

2062
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:38,510
where guys come in with a
background in something you think,

2063
00:52:38,511 --> 00:52:38,691
man,

2064
00:52:38,691 --> 00:52:41,390
this guy's got to be a beast
and it just doesn't work out.

2065
00:52:41,690 --> 00:52:42,370
You know,

2066
00:52:42,370 --> 00:52:47,370
I hear they all third round Hester
probably down two rounds if you,

2067
00:52:48,291 --> 00:52:49,070
uh,

2068
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:49,780
we barely,

2069
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:53,270
I mean we really shouldn't be scoring
in here cause we're not really paying

2070
00:52:53,271 --> 00:52:53,630
attention.

2071
00:52:53,630 --> 00:52:54,031
Oh Nice.

2072
00:52:54,031 --> 00:52:54,490
Straight ones.

2073
00:52:54,490 --> 00:52:56,060
Hester is going after him here.

2074
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:57,500
Big Shot to the body

2075
00:52:59,390 --> 00:53:00,740
and Neto got tagged.

2076
00:53:00,830 --> 00:53:02,390
Oh officers tagging him.

2077
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:04,820
Oh my God,

2078
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:06,013
he's

2079
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:08,930
so crazy.

2080
00:53:08,950 --> 00:53:10,840
He was fucking him up chest.

2081
00:53:10,850 --> 00:53:12,620
We were talking about and you're athletic,

2082
00:53:12,621 --> 00:53:13,520
you're physical,

2083
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:14,271
powerful,

2084
00:53:14,271 --> 00:53:15,440
but don't have your feet under you.

2085
00:53:15,441 --> 00:53:16,190
It's not going to help you.

2086
00:53:16,190 --> 00:53:16,670
Yeah.

2087
00:53:16,670 --> 00:53:19,220
And all he's doing on
the bottom is surviving.

2088
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:19,641
I mean,

2089
00:53:19,641 --> 00:53:20,990
he's not getting up to his feet.

2090
00:53:20,991 --> 00:53:22,100
He's not escaping.

2091
00:53:22,130 --> 00:53:22,870
He's not,

2092
00:53:22,870 --> 00:53:23,600
I mean,

2093
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:26,220
he got him down once with
that beautiful hip toss,

2094
00:53:26,221 --> 00:53:27,330
but then what happened?

2095
00:53:27,610 --> 00:53:29,070
You got slapped half swept.

2096
00:53:29,610 --> 00:53:31,380
That's a beautiful deep half sweep to,

2097
00:53:31,381 --> 00:53:32,610
I want to see that more often.

2098
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:36,000
It's probably pretty tough to get
both legs trapped in there like that.

2099
00:53:36,001 --> 00:53:38,040
It's one of those weird situations like,

2100
00:53:38,041 --> 00:53:38,550
uh,

2101
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:39,240
when uh,

2102
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:43,650
Benevidez fought Tim Elliot and had
both his arms trap in the Guillotine,

2103
00:53:43,651 --> 00:53:44,370
so he had a tablet.

2104
00:53:44,370 --> 00:53:44,840
It's feet.

2105
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:45,351
It was crazy.

2106
00:53:45,351 --> 00:53:45,600
He goes,

2107
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:45,781
look,

2108
00:53:45,781 --> 00:53:46,321
it's beautiful.

2109
00:53:46,321 --> 00:53:49,080
Transition to the Mount
Neto is just so slick

2110
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:51,990
at Saks when someone does that to you.

2111
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:53,573
Yeah.

2112
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:55,311
Yeah.

2113
00:53:55,311 --> 00:53:56,420
I've never seen that,

2114
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:57,440
that sort of,

2115
00:53:57,441 --> 00:53:57,980
uh,

2116
00:53:57,980 --> 00:53:59,270
that position where it guys,

2117
00:53:59,290 --> 00:54:01,550
both arms are trapped and
he's getting guillotined

2118
00:54:03,110 --> 00:54:04,450
now's got sick mountain.

2119
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:05,653
It happens.

2120
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:09,050
It can happen a lot when guys go
underneath both ways for the past,

2121
00:54:09,590 --> 00:54:11,400
especially with the [inaudible]
that choke over the,

2122
00:54:11,490 --> 00:54:13,070
the front kron Gracie
does it all the time.

2123
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:13,810
Yeah,

2124
00:54:13,810 --> 00:54:14,480
it's a pain.

2125
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:15,830
The key is a whole new world.

2126
00:54:15,831 --> 00:54:16,850
Jeff Glover likes that too.

2127
00:54:16,851 --> 00:54:18,860
He'll sit back when you try
and pass on eighth his legs,

2128
00:54:18,861 --> 00:54:19,750
he'll sit back and give it to you.

2129
00:54:19,810 --> 00:54:20,810
I'll hop right over your back.

2130
00:54:21,350 --> 00:54:22,183
But that's his thing.

2131
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:23,600
You don't see it a lot in a moment.

2132
00:54:23,930 --> 00:54:25,130
He's a master.

2133
00:54:25,490 --> 00:54:26,360
He really is.

2134
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:30,170
Glover is a master and kids
would be so good at Jujitsu.

2135
00:54:30,730 --> 00:54:31,081
He,

2136
00:54:31,081 --> 00:54:31,431
you know,

2137
00:54:31,431 --> 00:54:34,940
he's doing something that Mitch
Clark just started doing that.

2138
00:54:34,941 --> 00:54:35,540
Uh,

2139
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:38,040
he'll like let you pass into a Darce.

2140
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:40,970
Glover was like one of the
first guys I ever saw do that.

2141
00:54:41,210 --> 00:54:44,750
And now Mitch Clark was the first guy
to ever pull that off in the UFC on ally

2142
00:54:44,751 --> 00:54:45,290
Quinta.

2143
00:54:45,290 --> 00:54:45,620
Yeah.

2144
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:46,790
Beautiful submission.

2145
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:50,810
Like let go to let and he's
passing as he's passing.

2146
00:54:50,811 --> 00:54:51,770
He thinks he's getting signed.

2147
00:54:51,771 --> 00:54:53,930
Controlled falls right into a locked up.

2148
00:54:53,931 --> 00:54:54,764
Doris,

2149
00:54:54,770 --> 00:54:57,420
you gotta have a lot of confidence in
your darts to pull that off though.

2150
00:54:57,430 --> 00:54:58,263
Yeah.

2151
00:54:58,460 --> 00:54:58,611
Yeah.

2152
00:54:58,611 --> 00:54:59,444
It's gotta be strong.

2153
00:54:59,450 --> 00:55:00,500
You've got to have wrong,

2154
00:55:00,590 --> 00:55:01,423
like good.

2155
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:04,310
You got to know that that Shit's money.

2156
00:55:05,150 --> 00:55:05,720
Well,

2157
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:06,500
Ooh,

2158
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:07,490
Clint tagged him.

2159
00:55:08,570 --> 00:55:12,800
Hester had him really badly hurt at the
beginning of this round man and now he's

2160
00:55:12,801 --> 00:55:14,150
on top in the guard.

2161
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:18,470
He might be able to finish this fight
if he could tag this to it a few times

2162
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:20,510
when he doesn't seem like he would,

2163
00:55:20,511 --> 00:55:21,141
that kind of frame.

2164
00:55:21,141 --> 00:55:21,974
He hasn't gassed.

2165
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:22,893
Yeah.

2166
00:55:23,330 --> 00:55:23,900
Well he's,

2167
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:26,300
he's real cognizant about pacing himself.

2168
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:26,600
You know,

2169
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:31,070
he actually talked about it recently that
there was a time where he was fighting

2170
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:35,420
and he was tagging the guy and I was
saying he probably be best served to back

2171
00:55:35,421 --> 00:55:40,340
off right now and not gas out because if
a guy is still there and you unload on

2172
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:40,520
him.

2173
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:44,060
And so he backed off and then
he thanked me after the fight.

2174
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:44,781
I was like,

2175
00:55:44,781 --> 00:55:45,590
that was good advice,

2176
00:55:45,590 --> 00:55:46,423
man.

2177
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:48,920
Uh,

2178
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:49,091
he,

2179
00:55:49,091 --> 00:55:51,410
he's on top and he's fucking Neto up.

2180
00:55:51,470 --> 00:55:51,861
Oh,

2181
00:55:51,861 --> 00:55:52,694
big elbow.

2182
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:53,451
Dave Jansen,

2183
00:55:53,451 --> 00:55:54,111
Kia Tina guy.

2184
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:54,501
One time.

2185
00:55:54,501 --> 00:55:54,921
It didn't one,

2186
00:55:54,921 --> 00:55:55,754
cause I told him too.

2187
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:56,571
I didn't tell him too.

2188
00:55:56,571 --> 00:55:58,320
I just said it's a good
position for a beauty.

2189
00:55:58,360 --> 00:55:58,581
He goes,

2190
00:55:58,581 --> 00:55:59,900
I heard you went for the
kitchen and you got it.

2191
00:56:00,950 --> 00:56:01,251
Yeah,

2192
00:56:01,251 --> 00:56:01,940
you're welcome.

2193
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:05,240
It's a weird thing like sometimes guys
will be right in front of me and I'll say

2194
00:56:05,241 --> 00:56:08,090
what he's got to do to pass this when
he's got to do to get out and you'll see

2195
00:56:08,091 --> 00:56:08,960
the guy doing it.

2196
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:12,620
But you know you're kind of coaching
them but you kind of have to it just

2197
00:56:12,621 --> 00:56:13,730
because they're in front of you.

2198
00:56:13,731 --> 00:56:15,260
You still have to say stop talking.

2199
00:56:15,270 --> 00:56:15,900
Yeah.

2200
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:17,690
You still have to say
what's your should be done.

2201
00:56:17,730 --> 00:56:19,070
Next time I pick somebody up,

2202
00:56:19,071 --> 00:56:20,230
I'm going to throw him over right there.

2203
00:56:21,290 --> 00:56:21,900
Tell me what to do.

2204
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:25,870
I'll help you out if I know
and sometimes I'm baffled.

2205
00:56:26,490 --> 00:56:28,840
What do you think about having
big crazy dreadlocks like that?

2206
00:56:28,841 --> 00:56:30,460
That would make it harder
to get out of shit?

2207
00:56:30,461 --> 00:56:32,050
Wouldn't a lot harder I imagine.

2208
00:56:32,290 --> 00:56:33,700
I mean it looks sexy as fuck Clint,

2209
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:35,080
but God damn son,

2210
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:36,430
you also blind to dude,

2211
00:56:36,431 --> 00:56:38,080
if you send your guard and moving
his head around the whole time.

2212
00:56:38,130 --> 00:56:38,260
Well,

2213
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:39,400
I always thought that about clay.

2214
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:40,570
Seriously.

2215
00:56:40,570 --> 00:56:40,820
Clay,

2216
00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:41,110
Cancun.

2217
00:56:41,110 --> 00:56:41,750
See Shit,

2218
00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:42,670
the Predator going on.

2219
00:56:43,670 --> 00:56:46,030
I mean [inaudible] has got
the craziest hair ever.

2220
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:46,780
Yeah.

2221
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:47,730
Fighting with that hair.

2222
00:56:47,731 --> 00:56:49,300
And the other thing is
what if you get hit,

2223
00:56:49,301 --> 00:56:50,280
it goes flying through the air.

2224
00:56:50,281 --> 00:56:50,341
It,

2225
00:56:50,341 --> 00:56:50,801
it makes it look little.

2226
00:56:50,801 --> 00:56:52,210
You got to hit a lot harder than you did.

2227
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:53,231
I've been,

2228
00:56:53,231 --> 00:56:54,760
Hennessy is always fucking with his hair.

2229
00:56:54,790 --> 00:56:56,770
Every time he fights it look good man.

2230
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:59,080
How about the fact that the dude used
to fight with a toothpick in his mouth?

2231
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:00,430
It's ridiculous.

2232
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:03,670
Fought championship level fights with
the fucking toothpick in his mouth.

2233
00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:08,650
Is he going to have to take them down to
the officially catch that or he'd just

2234
00:57:08,651 --> 00:57:08,981
stopped it.

2235
00:57:08,981 --> 00:57:09,814
I caught it.

2236
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:10,450
I know they,

2237
00:57:10,450 --> 00:57:11,081
they caught him.

2238
00:57:11,081 --> 00:57:12,820
Did they go cut that shit out?

2239
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:14,320
Check his mouth.

2240
00:57:14,350 --> 00:57:14,771
Okay,

2241
00:57:14,771 --> 00:57:15,310
good.

2242
00:57:15,310 --> 00:57:15,790
Yeah,

2243
00:57:15,790 --> 00:57:19,070
they like alerted him and no
one certain terms like bro,

2244
00:57:19,071 --> 00:57:19,904
he can't do that.

2245
00:57:21,790 --> 00:57:22,750
He's so crazy,

2246
00:57:23,170 --> 00:57:24,580
guys fighting world champions.

2247
00:57:24,581 --> 00:57:25,990
He's got a fucking toothpick in his mouth.

2248
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:29,950
I don't know where he was sticking that
thing on this tooth as his mouthpiece,

2249
00:57:31,510 --> 00:57:32,470
but it's a lower,

2250
00:57:32,770 --> 00:57:35,350
he's hiding in the lower part
of his mouth and your throat.

2251
00:57:35,351 --> 00:57:37,030
You're done in the middle of a fight.

2252
00:57:37,570 --> 00:57:38,403
It could too.

2253
00:57:38,530 --> 00:57:40,270
Oh easily going to get rocked.

2254
00:57:40,271 --> 00:57:41,410
Everybody gets rocked.

2255
00:57:41,490 --> 00:57:42,540
You gotta look smooth and you know,

2256
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:43,091
I mean,

2257
00:57:43,091 --> 00:57:48,091
so arguably that was in his face in his
mouth when he got showtime kicked when

2258
00:57:48,101 --> 00:57:48,934
Anthony Pennys yeah,

2259
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:51,070
leaping kicked him in the
face and he went flying.

2260
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:52,210
He had a toothpick in his mouth

2261
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:54,611
I think.

2262
00:57:54,611 --> 00:57:54,950
I mean,

2263
00:57:54,950 --> 00:57:55,371
I don't worry.

2264
00:57:55,371 --> 00:57:55,990
I swallowed it.

2265
00:57:55,990 --> 00:57:57,250
I know he did once Matt.

2266
00:57:57,251 --> 00:58:00,100
And the reason why I know he did
is because the fight was over.

2267
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:04,630
I was watching him and then all sudden I
watched him pull a toothpick out of his

2268
00:58:04,631 --> 00:58:04,811
mouth.

2269
00:58:04,811 --> 00:58:08,230
Like I saw the fight being
over the is fine I believe.

2270
00:58:08,231 --> 00:58:08,471
Cause that's,

2271
00:58:08,471 --> 00:58:09,430
remember you talking about it?

2272
00:58:09,490 --> 00:58:10,660
I believe it was the Diaz fight.

2273
00:58:10,690 --> 00:58:10,991
I don't,

2274
00:58:10,991 --> 00:58:11,830
I'm not sure though,

2275
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:13,000
but whatever it was,

2276
00:58:13,090 --> 00:58:15,430
he had a toothpick in his mouth and I go,

2277
00:58:15,431 --> 00:58:16,110
where'd you get that too?

2278
00:58:16,110 --> 00:58:16,300
I like,

2279
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:17,830
I asked him in the post
fight interview like,

2280
00:58:17,831 --> 00:58:18,820
where'd you get that toothpick?

2281
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,140
Like you had to pick any my like,

2282
00:58:20,150 --> 00:58:20,441
no,

2283
00:58:20,441 --> 00:58:20,590
no,

2284
00:58:20,590 --> 00:58:20,950
no.

2285
00:58:20,950 --> 00:58:23,500
And then I talked to John
Crouch about and he's like,

2286
00:58:23,501 --> 00:58:23,681
yeah,

2287
00:58:23,681 --> 00:58:24,910
I can't get them to stop doing that.

2288
00:58:24,910 --> 00:58:27,130
Like you can't get him to
stop fighting with a bucket

2289
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:31,240
of all the shit you can
get him to do in training.

2290
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:32,531
You can't go.

2291
00:58:32,531 --> 00:58:34,120
Don't do this life threatening shit.

2292
00:58:34,121 --> 00:58:35,080
You gotta pick your battles.

2293
00:58:35,170 --> 00:58:35,770
Oh,

2294
00:58:35,770 --> 00:58:36,341
great shape.

2295
00:58:36,341 --> 00:58:36,911
He doesn't drink,

2296
00:58:36,911 --> 00:58:38,350
doesn't parties and athlete.

2297
00:58:38,351 --> 00:58:38,950
He's smart.

2298
00:58:38,950 --> 00:58:39,940
He does everything right.

2299
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:40,990
You know,

2300
00:58:40,990 --> 00:58:42,220
but it comes to that.

2301
00:58:42,250 --> 00:58:42,910
Nope,

2302
00:58:42,910 --> 00:58:43,701
I'm going to fight with tooth.

2303
00:58:43,701 --> 00:58:44,410
Pick up my mouth.

2304
00:58:44,410 --> 00:58:45,460
Oh God,

2305
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:48,293
look at

2306
00:58:49,580 --> 00:58:50,413
champ.

2307
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:51,310
Forgot the bell.

2308
00:58:51,311 --> 00:58:52,360
I guess you can do that.

2309
00:58:52,390 --> 00:58:52,840
Yeah.

2310
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:53,710
Fuck man.

2311
00:58:54,490 --> 00:58:55,171
How good is God?

2312
00:58:55,171 --> 00:58:56,260
Damn Anthony Pettis.

2313
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:57,280
Yeah.

2314
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:58,690
Fuck that guy's good.

2315
00:58:58,900 --> 00:58:59,733
He gives this stud.

2316
00:59:00,230 --> 00:59:00,910
Awesome.

2317
00:59:00,910 --> 00:59:01,780
His kicking is.

2318
00:59:01,930 --> 00:59:04,390
He do grief is is on the podcast
last week and we showed me,

2319
00:59:04,391 --> 00:59:08,530
he showed me a kickboxing bout or
an MMA bout where he got taken down.

2320
00:59:08,531 --> 00:59:09,364
He got slammed,

2321
00:59:09,430 --> 00:59:11,050
his shoulder popped out of place.

2322
00:59:11,051 --> 00:59:12,220
My shoulder was fucked up.

2323
00:59:12,430 --> 00:59:13,570
He got stood back up.

2324
00:59:13,571 --> 00:59:15,220
You could see his shoulder was fucked.

2325
00:59:15,430 --> 00:59:16,660
He's moving away from the guy.

2326
00:59:16,750 --> 00:59:18,220
Boom lands a high kick,

2327
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,710
knocked the guy out with
a fucked up shoulder.

2328
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:25,610
I was like hanging off of his body
and he landed a beautiful picture.

2329
00:59:25,611 --> 00:59:29,840
Perfect wrap around left high kick
just like you landed on Lozan.

2330
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:33,260
What I don't want to see
honestly what concerns me is,

2331
00:59:33,290 --> 00:59:34,123
is

2332
00:59:34,630 --> 00:59:35,640
Gotcha Ring Russ

2333
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:36,900
being a huge factor in his career.

2334
00:59:36,930 --> 00:59:37,530
Yeah.

2335
00:59:37,530 --> 00:59:37,951
Injuries.

2336
00:59:37,951 --> 00:59:39,510
Just keep him out so much.

2337
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:40,231
I just,

2338
00:59:40,231 --> 00:59:42,090
I hate seeing guys like
that are so talented,

2339
00:59:42,630 --> 00:59:44,300
but no,

2340
00:59:44,430 --> 00:59:45,450
I don't want to say fragile,

2341
00:59:45,451 --> 00:59:46,560
but injury prone.

2342
00:59:46,561 --> 00:59:48,570
Have you want to put it where they
don't get that rhythm they need,

2343
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:50,010
I call myself clean Hester.

2344
00:59:50,011 --> 00:59:50,401
Got It.

2345
00:59:50,401 --> 00:59:50,790
Man.

2346
00:59:50,790 --> 00:59:52,880
Clint has to one interested in.

2347
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:54,113
Very interesting.

2348
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:55,050
I don't think I agree with that,

2349
00:59:55,051 --> 00:59:55,900
but yeah.

2350
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:56,041
Well,

2351
00:59:56,041 --> 00:59:58,410
the neither does Neto.

2352
00:59:58,770 --> 00:59:59,603
It looks pretty upset,

2353
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:00,991
but he took,

2354
01:00:00,991 --> 01:00:03,480
the first two would look
like the third round he won.

2355
01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:04,560
I mean for sure.

2356
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:06,480
Beaten them up in the third
round in the beginning.

2357
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:07,860
Took him to the ground.

2358
01:00:07,890 --> 01:00:09,060
He got mounted,

2359
01:00:09,061 --> 01:00:10,070
but then he got on top.

2360
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:11,070
Wound up in his guard.

2361
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:11,720
Yeah.

2362
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:13,950
I thought I thought no
one the first two rounds,

2363
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:15,210
but I guess not.

2364
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:15,690
Yeah.

2365
01:00:15,690 --> 01:00:16,530
Well who knows?

2366
01:00:17,130 --> 01:00:18,540
Who knows what the fuck
the judges are saying?

2367
01:00:18,750 --> 01:00:19,890
That was a beautiful take down,

2368
01:00:19,891 --> 01:00:22,320
but show the deep half
bit beautiful sweep.

2369
01:00:22,510 --> 01:00:23,490
Show the sweep.

2370
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:28,390
It's funny how after fights they're only
showing like the guy who wants island

2371
01:00:28,590 --> 01:00:29,640
look like a blowout.

2372
01:00:29,670 --> 01:00:30,471
I had to talk to my editor,

2373
01:00:30,471 --> 01:00:31,770
the the people who cut them.

2374
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:33,060
I don't know if you
have any input in that.

2375
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:33,300
I,

2376
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:34,260
I'll go to the truck and go,

2377
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:34,810
guys,

2378
01:00:34,810 --> 01:00:36,120
you make it look like a blowout.

2379
01:00:36,290 --> 01:00:39,150
Like you give me a close fight and the
replays are one dude beaten the other

2380
01:00:39,151 --> 01:00:39,261
dude.

2381
01:00:39,261 --> 01:00:39,490
I go,

2382
01:00:39,490 --> 01:00:40,890
you'd make it look like stop doing that.

2383
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:44,220
The problem with that you have as they're
doing this move of the fight thing,

2384
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:46,440
so they're not calling it like a replay.

2385
01:00:46,441 --> 01:00:46,940
The calling,

2386
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:47,970
the move of the fight,

2387
01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:49,013
but the fight,

2388
01:00:49,060 --> 01:00:50,220
that fight especially,

2389
01:00:50,430 --> 01:00:51,750
that was a very close fight.

2390
01:00:51,751 --> 01:00:52,140
Yeah,

2391
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:53,100
it was a good fight.

2392
01:00:53,340 --> 01:00:56,610
So you got to show both sides and when
you have something as beautiful is that

2393
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:58,200
that sweep Charlotte Shit.

2394
01:01:01,690 --> 01:01:03,160
Michael Pena in the building.

2395
01:01:03,310 --> 01:01:05,680
He's an actor on end of watch.

2396
01:01:05,681 --> 01:01:06,790
Do you know what end of watches?

2397
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:07,270
Yeah,

2398
01:01:07,270 --> 01:01:09,320
the movie into watch Jake Gyllenhaal.

2399
01:01:09,490 --> 01:01:09,701
Yeah.

2400
01:01:09,701 --> 01:01:10,534
Jake Gyllenhaal.

2401
01:01:10,570 --> 01:01:11,403
Yeah,

2402
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:12,070
pin.

2403
01:01:12,070 --> 01:01:14,800
And he's funny in everything
he does is it's a cop movie,

2404
01:01:14,801 --> 01:01:17,590
but like a serious cop movie where
they know it was on a training day,

2405
01:01:17,650 --> 01:01:18,490
like a training day time.

2406
01:01:18,491 --> 01:01:19,031
Pretty recent,

2407
01:01:19,031 --> 01:01:19,260
right?

2408
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:19,540
Yeah.

2409
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:19,991
Pretty recent.

2410
01:01:19,991 --> 01:01:20,710
Couple of years.

2411
01:01:20,710 --> 01:01:21,700
You know what's going on,

2412
01:01:21,701 --> 01:01:25,240
their partners and someone dies or
they both die or no gay cowboy stuff.

2413
01:01:25,690 --> 01:01:26,170
No.

2414
01:01:26,170 --> 01:01:27,670
Whenever I see Jake Eula Hall,

2415
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:30,280
that's where your brain goes.

2416
01:01:30,281 --> 01:01:30,361
Oh,

2417
01:01:30,361 --> 01:01:31,194
that's where it goes.

2418
01:01:31,210 --> 01:01:31,470
No,

2419
01:01:31,470 --> 01:01:31,940
he said,

2420
01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:32,800
you suck one day here,

2421
01:01:32,830 --> 01:01:34,690
a cock sucker for the rest of your life.

2422
01:01:34,750 --> 01:01:37,180
I don't think you dad's the only
guy says that you can build this.

2423
01:01:37,350 --> 01:01:40,120
You can build a million pills in your
lifetime and never be a bridge builder.

2424
01:01:40,180 --> 01:01:41,500
Life life lessons.

2425
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:42,160
Yeah.

2426
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:46,240
There's some certain things you want to
avoid and gay cowboy movies are one of

2427
01:01:46,241 --> 01:01:46,840
them,

2428
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:47,960
but that's a funny one.

2429
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:49,540
Covered pretty well man.

2430
01:01:49,660 --> 01:01:50,720
I both guys were,

2431
01:01:52,810 --> 01:01:54,160
the other ones were making fun of,

2432
01:01:54,161 --> 01:01:55,570
so I got to make,

2433
01:01:56,630 --> 01:01:57,550
he's doing all right.

2434
01:01:57,830 --> 01:01:59,590
Well I wouldn't take a tricked
into it and my friends like,

2435
01:01:59,591 --> 01:01:59,711
hey,

2436
01:01:59,711 --> 01:02:01,180
you want to go see a
movie about gay cowboys?

2437
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:03,960
And this is when I was
on drugs and I was back.

2438
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:04,370
Nice.

2439
01:02:04,370 --> 01:02:04,570
Yeah,

2440
01:02:04,570 --> 01:02:05,530
that sounds hilarious.

2441
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:06,881
That sounds so funny.

2442
01:02:06,881 --> 01:02:07,810
We got there and I'm like,

2443
01:02:07,811 --> 01:02:11,030
what the fuck you were looking for like
a will Ferrell movie or some shit movie

2444
01:02:11,031 --> 01:02:11,864
about gay cowboy.

2445
01:02:12,710 --> 01:02:13,541
So I watched the whole thing.

2446
01:02:13,541 --> 01:02:14,080
It was great.

2447
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:15,610
I enjoyed that movie tremendously.

2448
01:02:16,370 --> 01:02:19,540
All the wrong reasons as
people made it happen.

2449
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:20,070
It

2450
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:21,210
was a comedy to me.

2451
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:24,300
I don't know what everybody
else saw spitting on his hand.

2452
01:02:25,050 --> 01:02:29,580
He shoved his dick and with one stroke
like what you told me what's going on

2453
01:02:29,581 --> 01:02:30,270
here?

2454
01:02:30,270 --> 01:02:34,200
You could take the bit I want to I if
it was just going to this you to answer

2455
01:02:34,201 --> 01:02:36,900
this question for me cause I want to
put like Asca gay dude at some point.

2456
01:02:36,901 --> 01:02:37,440
Okay.

2457
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:38,130
Seriously.

2458
01:02:38,130 --> 01:02:38,491
And this is,

2459
01:02:38,491 --> 01:02:39,960
this is an all serious and
they're gonna lie to you.

2460
01:02:39,961 --> 01:02:44,961
So I know they lied to me but having
sex with a chick you just met can be a

2461
01:02:45,421 --> 01:02:45,751
little longer.

2462
01:02:45,751 --> 01:02:46,021
You don't want,

2463
01:02:46,021 --> 01:02:47,850
she likes to know when you like
you know can be a little awkward.

2464
01:02:48,250 --> 01:02:49,021
A dude,

2465
01:02:49,021 --> 01:02:49,441
we've got to go.

2466
01:02:49,441 --> 01:02:50,310
So are you,

2467
01:02:50,311 --> 01:02:51,090
am I,

2468
01:02:51,090 --> 01:02:56,090
are you because I don't are you like
[inaudible] decision in like in a club in

2469
01:02:56,941 --> 01:02:57,774
15 seconds?

2470
01:02:58,130 --> 01:02:58,741
I'm just curious.

2471
01:02:58,741 --> 01:03:00,390
Like it's awkward numb that says yeah,

2472
01:03:02,060 --> 01:03:03,570
do they fuck every 15 seconds

2473
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:10,170
but to go like so are you are cause I
don't are you are cause was in the movie

2474
01:03:10,190 --> 01:03:11,430
they decided pretty quick.

2475
01:03:11,490 --> 01:03:12,323
I have friends.

2476
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:13,080
Yeah.

2477
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:14,250
You got to ask one and just go.

2478
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:16,970
It's pretty obvious when you look
at it if you don't know them.

2479
01:03:17,190 --> 01:03:18,840
If like if you just
met them and just like,

2480
01:03:19,230 --> 01:03:20,410
like we have all taken the chicken,

2481
01:03:20,490 --> 01:03:21,400
the we didn't know and just went,

2482
01:03:21,410 --> 01:03:21,990
oh well,

2483
01:03:21,990 --> 01:03:25,200
but if you decide at some point,

2484
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:25,621
yeah,

2485
01:03:25,621 --> 01:03:27,330
I think that they know.

2486
01:03:27,620 --> 01:03:29,190
You just know one guy,

2487
01:03:29,191 --> 01:03:31,290
he's the wife and one guy's
the husbands instantly,

2488
01:03:31,291 --> 01:03:31,540
you know,

2489
01:03:31,540 --> 01:03:32,373
soon as you hit on them,

2490
01:03:32,950 --> 01:03:37,950
that's where they know up front some
questions just about how he just,

2491
01:03:40,021 --> 01:03:41,040
he just got a brave

2492
01:03:43,050 --> 01:03:44,070
I imagine.

2493
01:03:44,670 --> 01:03:45,180
Breathe,

2494
01:03:45,180 --> 01:03:45,540
breathe.

2495
01:03:45,540 --> 01:03:46,130
Okay.

2496
01:03:46,130 --> 01:03:47,100
Everybody says about everything.

2497
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:47,970
Very soundly.

2498
01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:50,580
Chamber breathe.

2499
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:51,593
Just breathe.

2500
01:03:51,850 --> 01:03:52,683
Just breathe.

2501
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:54,630
The cryo chamber is supposed
to be a mother fucker.

2502
01:03:54,631 --> 01:03:56,220
I got to do that in between rounds.

2503
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:57,210
Breathe every day.

2504
01:03:57,390 --> 01:03:57,931
Wow.

2505
01:03:57,931 --> 01:03:59,190
How far away is it from your house?

2506
01:03:59,250 --> 01:04:00,940
It's in between my strength conditioning,

2507
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:01,480
champagne,

2508
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:02,313
my real gym.

2509
01:04:02,460 --> 01:04:04,080
Do you do a post workout or pre?

2510
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:05,753
Um,

2511
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,200
I do it at 10 o'clock every day.

2512
01:04:07,201 --> 01:04:10,080
So sometimes I work out before
it and sometimes I don't work.

2513
01:04:10,081 --> 01:04:10,980
I just go straight there.

2514
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:12,270
Is there any restrictions on,

2515
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:15,300
for folks who don't know what the crowd
chamber is explained with Nora's better

2516
01:04:15,301 --> 01:04:15,571
than me,

2517
01:04:15,571 --> 01:04:16,560
so I just do it everyday.

2518
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:18,871
But yeah,

2519
01:04:18,871 --> 01:04:19,710
it's a,

2520
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:21,900
you get into a little pod cylinder thing.

2521
01:04:21,901 --> 01:04:22,441
It opens up,

2522
01:04:22,441 --> 01:04:22,890
you get in,

2523
01:04:22,890 --> 01:04:23,641
they raise the floor up.

2524
01:04:23,641 --> 01:04:24,630
So your head's above the,

2525
01:04:24,740 --> 01:04:25,573
the top.

2526
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:26,920
They pumping liquid nitrogen,

2527
01:04:26,940 --> 01:04:29,010
liquid nitrogen hits oxygen,

2528
01:04:29,011 --> 01:04:31,020
it turns into a gas science class.

2529
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:31,981
And then,

2530
01:04:31,981 --> 01:04:32,320
uh,

2531
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:32,541
it,

2532
01:04:32,541 --> 01:04:32,790
it's,

2533
01:04:32,790 --> 01:04:37,790
but it's heavier so it sits in there
and it gets down to minus two 56 usually

2534
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:39,110
Fahrenheit.

2535
01:04:39,110 --> 01:04:42,300
At W I set the record
of our place for two 63.

2536
01:04:42,810 --> 01:04:43,290
Oh my God.

2537
01:04:43,290 --> 01:04:44,220
You wanted more,

2538
01:04:44,610 --> 01:04:45,480
you wanted it colder.

2539
01:04:45,481 --> 01:04:46,314
She just,

2540
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:47,213
she just does it.

2541
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:48,840
What's between you and she's like,

2542
01:04:48,841 --> 01:04:49,381
you can take it.

2543
01:04:49,381 --> 01:04:50,540
I'm going to try something and I'm like,

2544
01:04:50,541 --> 01:04:52,130
well I'm going to try something on you.

2545
01:04:52,340 --> 01:04:52,720
Yeah.

2546
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:55,830
See degrees below zero
isn't quite doing it.

2547
01:04:56,300 --> 01:04:59,070
So where I recommend that for everybody,

2548
01:04:59,071 --> 01:05:00,780
it's probably the singular
best thing I've ever done.

2549
01:05:00,930 --> 01:05:02,010
Wow.

2550
01:05:02,070 --> 01:05:02,903
What way?

2551
01:05:03,060 --> 01:05:03,840
Recovery?

2552
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:04,211
Recovery.

2553
01:05:04,211 --> 01:05:05,620
At least what it like what,

2554
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:06,990
what does it do that so awesome.

2555
01:05:06,991 --> 01:05:10,980
Like give me just feel better and
things like the swelling goes down of

2556
01:05:10,981 --> 01:05:11,550
everything.

2557
01:05:11,550 --> 01:05:12,660
Bruising goes away.

2558
01:05:12,690 --> 01:05:14,910
You get out and you only ended
in the front for three minutes.

2559
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:16,140
I mean I last three minutes,

2560
01:05:16,141 --> 01:05:17,440
but most people less than a minute two.

2561
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:18,460
Wow.

2562
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:20,830
I just [inaudible] he just got it out.

2563
01:05:20,831 --> 01:05:21,100
Yeah.

2564
01:05:21,100 --> 01:05:23,450
Just cause there's something
wrong and then once you get you,

2565
01:05:23,470 --> 01:05:24,500
it's definitely something wrong with it.

2566
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:26,800
And then once he get out,

2567
01:05:26,801 --> 01:05:30,310
it's just like all the blood flushes
to your skin of rush of blood.

2568
01:05:30,311 --> 01:05:31,144
And I want to go,

2569
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:32,020
you know,

2570
01:05:32,020 --> 01:05:33,070
this is a new thing too,

2571
01:05:33,071 --> 01:05:33,341
right?

2572
01:05:33,341 --> 01:05:34,960
They've only been doing it
for the last one in Europe,

2573
01:05:34,961 --> 01:05:35,980
that gators decades.

2574
01:05:36,130 --> 01:05:36,491
Oh really?

2575
01:05:36,491 --> 01:05:37,540
Everything's been in Europe for instance,

2576
01:05:37,550 --> 01:05:39,740
as long as the u s has had for
five years or something like that.

2577
01:05:39,741 --> 01:05:40,574
I don't know.

2578
01:05:40,630 --> 01:05:41,170
I mean it's,

2579
01:05:41,170 --> 01:05:42,003
it's pretty,

2580
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:42,911
it's pretty awesome.

2581
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:43,541
I think that,

2582
01:05:43,541 --> 01:05:43,750
uh,

2583
01:05:43,750 --> 01:05:44,540
people and let me know,

2584
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:45,700
I took my daughter in the day.

2585
01:05:45,701 --> 01:05:48,370
She's two and a half
cause she's sitting there,

2586
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:48,851
it's just,

2587
01:05:48,851 --> 01:05:49,570
she didn't,

2588
01:05:49,570 --> 01:05:51,370
she has juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.

2589
01:05:51,490 --> 01:05:52,323
So

2590
01:05:53,890 --> 01:05:54,490
that's what it was,

2591
01:05:54,490 --> 01:05:56,200
was built for was people with Ra.

2592
01:05:56,290 --> 01:05:57,123
Wow.

2593
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:58,570
And so I brought her
in there and you know,

2594
01:05:58,571 --> 01:05:59,080
before I'm like,

2595
01:05:59,080 --> 01:05:59,291
Oh,

2596
01:05:59,291 --> 01:06:02,410
you know me and me and Brittany went in
there and I showed her pictures and they

2597
01:06:02,411 --> 01:06:03,460
said it gets really cold.

2598
01:06:03,461 --> 01:06:03,651
I said,

2599
01:06:03,651 --> 01:06:04,481
do you want to get cold?

2600
01:06:04,481 --> 01:06:05,200
And she's like,

2601
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:06,033
no,

2602
01:06:07,140 --> 01:06:07,601
look at me like,

2603
01:06:07,601 --> 01:06:07,791
what are you,

2604
01:06:07,791 --> 01:06:08,770
are you stupid?

2605
01:06:09,220 --> 01:06:09,581
And I'm like,

2606
01:06:09,581 --> 01:06:10,001
okay.

2607
01:06:10,001 --> 01:06:12,610
And I kind of played it off and I brought
her with me and then she was in there

2608
01:06:12,611 --> 01:06:13,750
for maybe 10 seconds,

2609
01:06:14,110 --> 01:06:15,010
I'm going to climb out the top.

2610
01:06:15,011 --> 01:06:15,530
So I ain't,

2611
01:06:15,530 --> 01:06:16,390
did it help her?

2612
01:06:16,660 --> 01:06:17,493
Um,

2613
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:18,580
she's getting better.

2614
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:20,290
She's only done it that one time.

2615
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:20,651
I mean,

2616
01:06:20,651 --> 01:06:22,150
if I wasn't in Camp I would take her more.

2617
01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:23,160
But you know,

2618
01:06:23,170 --> 01:06:23,440
I,

2619
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:25,600
my day is so,

2620
01:06:25,750 --> 01:06:26,410
you know,

2621
01:06:26,410 --> 01:06:29,620
scheduled that I don't have
time to have a baby with me.

2622
01:06:30,110 --> 01:06:31,590
Yo could only two magical,

2623
01:06:32,550 --> 01:06:36,160
she has a lot of energy and she's really
smart and everyone says her kids are

2624
01:06:36,161 --> 01:06:36,461
smart,

2625
01:06:36,461 --> 01:06:38,690
but she's pretty advanced and,

2626
01:06:38,750 --> 01:06:40,960
and it's hard,

2627
01:06:40,961 --> 01:06:41,580
man.

2628
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:41,720
You,

2629
01:06:41,720 --> 01:06:44,860
we were talking about diet and things
along those lines and you have to be very

2630
01:06:44,861 --> 01:06:45,940
careful with her diet.

2631
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:46,990
She gluten free.

2632
01:06:47,050 --> 01:06:47,771
She,

2633
01:06:47,771 --> 01:06:48,490
uh,

2634
01:06:48,490 --> 01:06:49,510
I still give her some,

2635
01:06:49,570 --> 01:06:50,110
some,

2636
01:06:50,110 --> 01:06:50,620
some,

2637
01:06:50,620 --> 01:06:51,453
uh,

2638
01:06:51,850 --> 01:06:52,870
I mean she doesn't drink milk,

2639
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:54,400
but you'll have dairy through cheese,

2640
01:06:55,150 --> 01:06:56,230
red meat a little bit.

2641
01:06:56,470 --> 01:06:57,040
Um,

2642
01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:57,141
I,

2643
01:06:57,141 --> 01:06:59,680
that's why a big reason why I want to
get into hunting because the meat is so

2644
01:06:59,681 --> 01:07:01,870
nutritious and they have
so many friends that hunt.

2645
01:07:01,930 --> 01:07:03,580
I mean all my friends that
played pro baseball hunt,

2646
01:07:04,150 --> 01:07:04,571
a lot of my,

2647
01:07:04,571 --> 01:07:05,404
you know,

2648
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:06,340
fight or friends hunt,

2649
01:07:06,370 --> 01:07:07,360
just friends in general.

2650
01:07:07,361 --> 01:07:08,130
So you have,

2651
01:07:08,130 --> 01:07:09,910
you can to get some elk or some Moose,

2652
01:07:09,950 --> 01:07:12,250
some of the most nutritious
meat you could give anybody.

2653
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:12,811
My,

2654
01:07:12,811 --> 01:07:16,180
my Stepdad's a world renown hunter and
tracker up in Alaska or it used to be in

2655
01:07:16,181 --> 01:07:16,511
Alaska.

2656
01:07:16,511 --> 01:07:19,230
Now he's with my mom and northern
California and he's Jim Heroin.

2657
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:22,440
He's 80 years old and
like ex CIA Freemason.

2658
01:07:23,010 --> 01:07:24,520
Then it's practicing dentists,

2659
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:25,570
just a murderer,

2660
01:07:25,570 --> 01:07:26,021
animals,

2661
01:07:26,021 --> 01:07:26,381
people,

2662
01:07:26,381 --> 01:07:26,830
whatever.

2663
01:07:26,830 --> 01:07:27,663
I got a polar bear ruck,

2664
01:07:27,670 --> 01:07:32,050
he has one for me and the polar
bear rugs and he's fucking huge.

2665
01:07:32,051 --> 01:07:33,910
He's on anybody's freaking out right now.

2666
01:07:33,911 --> 01:07:38,290
Polar bears are not endangered
danger 80 years old.

2667
01:07:38,291 --> 01:07:40,870
So he killed stuff a long
time ago and he's just a,

2668
01:07:41,050 --> 01:07:41,883
he doesn't kill anymore.

2669
01:07:41,890 --> 01:07:44,290
I'm trying to talk them into
taking me to Alaska one last time.

2670
01:07:44,770 --> 01:07:45,610
Did have you seen that show,

2671
01:07:45,611 --> 01:07:46,444
the hunt?

2672
01:07:46,660 --> 01:07:47,140
No.

2673
01:07:47,140 --> 01:07:50,260
It's a new show that James
Hetfield from Metallica is the,

2674
01:07:50,261 --> 01:07:50,490
uh,

2675
01:07:50,490 --> 01:07:54,510
I watched bubble comics
theater on Disney to be Ho Chi.

2676
01:07:54,511 --> 01:07:55,344
Last,

2677
01:07:55,350 --> 01:07:56,170
um,

2678
01:07:56,170 --> 01:08:01,170
James Hatfield is the commentator or the
narrator and they go to Kodiak Island

2679
01:08:01,991 --> 01:08:05,050
where the biggest grizzly bears in the
world live biggest brown bears in the

2680
01:08:05,051 --> 01:08:05,500
world.

2681
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:08,980
And these bears are 10 feet fucking
tall and these guys are hunting these 10

2682
01:08:08,981 --> 01:08:09,790
foot tall bear.

2683
01:08:09,790 --> 01:08:13,330
That's the kind of skin I
have freaking out about.

2684
01:08:13,331 --> 01:08:16,430
Hetfield being a part is they wanted
to remove him from the Glastonbury

2685
01:08:16,430 --> 01:08:18,620
music festival and everybody's angry.

2686
01:08:18,621 --> 01:08:20,300
And we know that if you love bears,

2687
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:23,120
you got to kill the big Boris cause
if you don't kill the big boards,

2688
01:08:23,121 --> 01:08:23,901
they eat babies.

2689
01:08:23,901 --> 01:08:28,280
Like people who don't understand
bears or freaking out about that show.

2690
01:08:28,281 --> 01:08:31,570
Like they need to kill bears
to keep the population healthy,

2691
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:32,990
otherwise they're going
to fuck each other up.

2692
01:08:32,991 --> 01:08:33,111
You know,

2693
01:08:33,111 --> 01:08:36,650
the first conservation were hunters
because they were out there in the

2694
01:08:36,651 --> 01:08:37,620
wilderness going is,

2695
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:37,990
you know,

2696
01:08:37,990 --> 01:08:39,220
this last section disappearing.

2697
01:08:39,260 --> 01:08:42,740
They knew they were out in the wild doing
the Teddy Roosevelt was an avid hunter

2698
01:08:42,741 --> 01:08:44,360
and started the park system.

2699
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:44,791
You know,

2700
01:08:44,791 --> 01:08:45,140
it's it.

2701
01:08:45,140 --> 01:08:45,980
People don't understand that.

2702
01:08:45,981 --> 01:08:47,900
It's just there's more deer today.

2703
01:08:47,901 --> 01:08:49,610
Then when Columbus landed in America,

2704
01:08:49,611 --> 01:08:52,640
and that's because of hunters and
conservationists and like money for

2705
01:08:52,641 --> 01:08:55,040
conservation all comes
from hunting license.

2706
01:08:55,041 --> 01:08:56,030
I need to kill them and eat them.

2707
01:08:56,290 --> 01:08:56,841
They're delicious.

2708
01:08:56,841 --> 01:08:57,910
I'll take you with me to delicious.

2709
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:58,221
We'll go,

2710
01:08:58,221 --> 01:08:58,700
man dude,

2711
01:08:58,700 --> 01:08:58,981
I want to,

2712
01:08:58,981 --> 01:08:59,900
after you get out of camp,

2713
01:08:59,930 --> 01:09:00,590
I'll bring you,

2714
01:09:00,590 --> 01:09:00,861
me,

2715
01:09:00,861 --> 01:09:01,041
you,

2716
01:09:01,041 --> 01:09:02,030
me and Steve Rinella.

2717
01:09:02,270 --> 01:09:02,650
Rinella.

2718
01:09:02,650 --> 01:09:05,120
And I had been talking about
doing that with the crush on him.

2719
01:09:05,270 --> 01:09:05,870
I do too.

2720
01:09:05,870 --> 01:09:06,380
He's awesome.

2721
01:09:06,380 --> 01:09:07,213
He's a sweetie.

2722
01:09:08,690 --> 01:09:13,310
He's a Haka and d is right now
is a about to fight Ricardo,

2723
01:09:13,311 --> 01:09:15,890
the bully llamas and a
really interesting fight.

2724
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:18,800
Diaz is a bad motherfucker on the ground.

2725
01:09:19,910 --> 01:09:20,750
Got The model sobbing.

2726
01:09:20,790 --> 01:09:21,623
Sandra right there,

2727
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:24,890
excellent Beltour fighter and
that's a known as Bellah tour,

2728
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:27,470
soon to be spike MMA if they're smart.

2729
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:28,430
We will see.

2730
01:09:28,790 --> 01:09:29,750
Just call him and man,

2731
01:09:29,751 --> 01:09:30,940
just come in boxing.

2732
01:09:30,990 --> 01:09:33,530
Boxing doesn't have the battlers.

2733
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:35,360
It's the battlers boxing series.

2734
01:09:35,361 --> 01:09:35,840
What is it?

2735
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:36,590
It's boxing.

2736
01:09:36,590 --> 01:09:37,700
She's called fucking boxing,

2737
01:09:38,780 --> 01:09:39,613
you know.

2738
01:09:39,950 --> 01:09:40,783
Good point.

2739
01:09:41,090 --> 01:09:42,030
I just think we'll play.

2740
01:09:42,370 --> 01:09:43,550
It's mixed martial arts.

2741
01:09:43,550 --> 01:09:44,480
Everybody knows what it is.

2742
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:47,930
Or here's the guy that's the
same referee earlier that uh,

2743
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:49,460
carry Hatley that fucked up

2744
01:09:51,090 --> 01:09:51,830
dark.

2745
01:09:51,830 --> 01:09:52,900
He was the guy who uh,

2746
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:53,833
called it.

2747
01:09:54,020 --> 01:09:54,853
Hey.

2748
01:09:55,300 --> 01:09:55,551
All right.

2749
01:09:55,551 --> 01:10:00,551
Ricardo Lamas is just about to fight
and if you're sinking this up at home,

2750
01:10:00,891 --> 01:10:01,730
we'll give you a,

2751
01:10:01,731 --> 01:10:03,320
the clock starts now.

2752
01:10:03,530 --> 01:10:03,861
Okay.

2753
01:10:03,861 --> 01:10:05,300
They just touch gloves just now.

2754
01:10:05,330 --> 01:10:05,631
All right,

2755
01:10:05,631 --> 01:10:06,350
here we go.

2756
01:10:06,350 --> 01:10:09,560
And Llamas just removed from his fight
with Josie all though where he was

2757
01:10:09,561 --> 01:10:11,840
winning the fifth round had although down,

2758
01:10:12,540 --> 01:10:13,131
guess who moves?

2759
01:10:13,131 --> 01:10:13,970
Just like Aldo.

2760
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:16,280
Alcorn d is same build,

2761
01:10:16,940 --> 01:10:17,773
real similar,

2762
01:10:17,810 --> 01:10:19,780
real similar Diaz,

2763
01:10:19,790 --> 01:10:23,520
great submission guy nine some McCreary
submissions I think if I remember it

2764
01:10:23,521 --> 01:10:24,020
correctly.

2765
01:10:24,020 --> 01:10:25,190
Very good on the ground.

2766
01:10:25,220 --> 01:10:30,220
And also like a lot like Aldo is very
competent standing up and not quite as

2767
01:10:31,971 --> 01:10:34,610
good but still very competent.

2768
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:35,901
He's no joke.

2769
01:10:35,901 --> 01:10:36,200
Like,

2770
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:36,920
it's no picnic.

2771
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:37,880
Standing up with this guy.

2772
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:38,901
Nice overhand,

2773
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:39,620
right.

2774
01:10:39,620 --> 01:10:41,600
All those got like one
of the best left hook,

2775
01:10:41,601 --> 01:10:43,100
right leg kicks in the business.

2776
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:44,841
The yell it out,

2777
01:10:44,841 --> 01:10:47,420
do the Duchy do the
Dutchy and he throws that,

2778
01:10:47,450 --> 01:10:50,210
that Holland combination man
that left hook to the body,

2779
01:10:50,211 --> 01:10:51,120
right leg cape.

2780
01:10:52,340 --> 01:10:52,761
Oh Man.

2781
01:10:52,761 --> 01:10:53,930
I remember when he came out to,

2782
01:10:53,931 --> 01:10:54,500
uh,

2783
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:55,333
I'm gonna,

2784
01:10:55,370 --> 01:10:56,430
I'm gonna run this tonight,

2785
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:59,540
but fought favor and that in
Sacramento and it was just like,

2786
01:10:59,910 --> 01:11:00,170
oh,

2787
01:11:00,170 --> 01:11:00,960
you're an awesome.

2788
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:01,610
Yeah.

2789
01:11:01,610 --> 01:11:03,750
That was one of the nastiest leg kicked.

2790
01:11:03,770 --> 01:11:04,790
Oh God.

2791
01:11:04,791 --> 01:11:05,290
That was Beverly.

2792
01:11:05,290 --> 01:11:06,123
Ever seen.

2793
01:11:06,250 --> 01:11:07,310
It was horrific.

2794
01:11:07,610 --> 01:11:10,410
And seeing his legs on Instagram
after the fight where you're,

2795
01:11:10,460 --> 01:11:15,460
I kept taking pictures of his leg and
it was up to literally twice the size.

2796
01:11:15,630 --> 01:11:17,340
It's not one month later
and it was still not good.

2797
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:18,361
I was like,

2798
01:11:18,361 --> 01:11:18,511
Bro,

2799
01:11:18,511 --> 01:11:19,260
you're right.

2800
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:23,190
Randy coture told me that it took him six
months to recover from the Pedro has a

2801
01:11:23,191 --> 01:11:23,590
fight.

2802
01:11:23,590 --> 01:11:24,000
Yeah.

2803
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:24,960
That's what was so hard.

2804
01:11:24,961 --> 01:11:28,140
It was hard alliance that second
fight and the first fight.

2805
01:11:28,170 --> 01:11:30,570
Most people who watch
thought that Pedro one,

2806
01:11:30,630 --> 01:11:31,310
I thought he did.

2807
01:11:31,310 --> 01:11:31,680
Yeah.

2808
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:35,910
A lot of people thought he did his old
school and then Randy came back and beat

2809
01:11:35,911 --> 01:11:36,960
the fuck out of Pedro.

2810
01:11:36,961 --> 01:11:37,950
His own the second fight.

2811
01:11:37,951 --> 01:11:39,010
Thinking about those like,

2812
01:11:39,890 --> 01:11:41,280
it's like not today son.

2813
01:11:41,310 --> 01:11:41,581
His,

2814
01:11:41,581 --> 01:11:41,671
oh,

2815
01:11:41,671 --> 01:11:43,830
had a tendency to start
slow in that costume.

2816
01:11:43,910 --> 01:11:45,090
[inaudible] you see those guys?

2817
01:11:45,091 --> 01:11:46,800
I came in the earth's kick a bag.

2818
01:11:47,820 --> 01:11:48,300
You know,

2819
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:50,160
I used to go over to Marco's a little bit.

2820
01:11:50,610 --> 01:11:50,771
Who?

2821
01:11:50,771 --> 01:11:54,480
Oss and seeing those giant
people kicked bags and stuff.

2822
01:11:54,540 --> 01:11:55,590
Oh my God.

2823
01:11:55,620 --> 01:11:56,250
Oh my God.

2824
01:11:56,250 --> 01:11:59,410
I've never seen anybody kick anything
harder than I've seen Pedro Huizar kick.

2825
01:12:00,570 --> 01:12:03,120
He kicked Rico Rodriguez
once in their fight.

2826
01:12:03,121 --> 01:12:05,260
They're the most boring fight
ever in the UFC was awful.

2827
01:12:05,270 --> 01:12:08,370
He kicked him once and Rico was like,

2828
01:12:08,430 --> 01:12:08,671
oh,

2829
01:12:08,671 --> 01:12:09,510
fuck all this,

2830
01:12:09,530 --> 01:12:10,530
walk this shit,

2831
01:12:10,770 --> 01:12:11,610
all this.

2832
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:12,061
Nothing.

2833
01:12:12,061 --> 01:12:14,160
I don't think anything but
a body shot in a lake kick.

2834
01:12:14,190 --> 01:12:15,150
I've seen fighters go,

2835
01:12:15,180 --> 01:12:15,931
fuck this.

2836
01:12:15,931 --> 01:12:16,380
I'm out.

2837
01:12:16,380 --> 01:12:19,350
I mean just mentally check out completely
of a fight from those two things.

2838
01:12:19,351 --> 01:12:24,180
Ricoh was in full defense mode
from then on and just said,

2839
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:24,810
you know what?

2840
01:12:24,810 --> 01:12:26,130
No one's knocking me the fuck out.

2841
01:12:26,131 --> 01:12:27,120
You're not breaking my leg.

2842
01:12:27,121 --> 01:12:27,601
So let's,

2843
01:12:27,601 --> 01:12:28,380
uh,

2844
01:12:28,380 --> 01:12:29,760
let's just do what we gotta do here.

2845
01:12:30,540 --> 01:12:32,400
I'll collect my last Zuph a paycheck.

2846
01:12:33,420 --> 01:12:34,560
He made the agreement.

2847
01:12:34,590 --> 01:12:35,700
I won't try to win.

2848
01:12:35,701 --> 01:12:36,720
You don't try to hurt me.

2849
01:12:36,990 --> 01:12:38,380
And you can see when a fighter does that,

2850
01:12:39,020 --> 01:12:42,990
I won't try and beat you if
you will let me have my legs.

2851
01:12:42,991 --> 01:12:44,100
There is a agreement.

2852
01:12:44,101 --> 01:12:44,990
They do it on time.

2853
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:46,380
They do and you see it in their eyes,

2854
01:12:46,381 --> 01:12:46,740
man.

2855
01:12:46,740 --> 01:12:47,790
We see it all the time.

2856
01:12:48,330 --> 01:12:48,870
Yeah.

2857
01:12:48,870 --> 01:12:50,910
I will stop fighting if you won't hurt me.

2858
01:12:50,970 --> 01:12:52,260
It's a fascinating moment.

2859
01:12:52,270 --> 01:12:53,460
We see a guy break.

2860
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:57,210
It's a fascinating and sometimes guys
will break and then rebound and come back

2861
01:12:57,390 --> 01:12:59,130
and break and rebound and come back.

2862
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:01,680
That sets where things
get really interesting.

2863
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:02,220
The,

2864
01:13:02,220 --> 01:13:06,660
the worst I think I've ever seen in
between rounds was Dan Hornbuckle against

2865
01:13:06,661 --> 01:13:07,494
Ben Aspirin.

2866
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:07,801
Ooh.

2867
01:13:07,801 --> 01:13:11,100
I was again like sat in that corner like,

2868
01:13:11,490 --> 01:13:15,540
and he's at a black belt in intensity
and every now good Dan humbucker was,

2869
01:13:15,541 --> 01:13:19,170
and he came back to that and sat in
his corner with his head down and just

2870
01:13:19,171 --> 01:13:21,950
didn't look like the same dude after
one round and getting tossed around.

2871
01:13:21,990 --> 01:13:23,430
He just knew he was
never going to catch up.

2872
01:13:23,460 --> 01:13:27,720
When you lock up with a guy like ascaris
and you get costs all over the place

2873
01:13:27,721 --> 01:13:29,490
and every time you're trying
to counter what he's doing,

2874
01:13:29,491 --> 01:13:30,900
he's already countering your counter.

2875
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:35,070
He's one step ahead of you every time
you down the whole time manhandling you.

2876
01:13:35,250 --> 01:13:36,480
And by the way,

2877
01:13:36,570 --> 01:13:40,500
he looks like he smokes pot
all day and he's Cheetos dude.

2878
01:13:40,501 --> 01:13:42,960
He does it works at the seven 11 bro.

2879
01:13:42,961 --> 01:13:46,460
And he's kicking my ass
kicking world clock.

2880
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:48,590
He doesn't look like Kevin Randleman road.

2881
01:13:48,690 --> 01:13:49,140
You know,

2882
01:13:49,140 --> 01:13:49,311
if,

2883
01:13:49,311 --> 01:13:50,850
if he looked like Tyron Woodley,

2884
01:13:50,851 --> 01:13:53,280
you would understand it like
I can't fuck with this guy.

2885
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:54,261
But no,

2886
01:13:54,261 --> 01:13:58,620
he looks like a a silly stoner and he's
just rag doll or had a little of that

2887
01:13:58,621 --> 01:13:58,921
and you're like,

2888
01:13:58,921 --> 01:13:59,221
Bro,

2889
01:13:59,221 --> 01:14:00,660
you do not look like you fight.

2890
01:14:00,780 --> 01:14:02,630
And he just get man dump dude.

2891
01:14:02,650 --> 01:14:07,140
The early days fade or win big when he
was doing a lot of weightlifting and

2892
01:14:07,141 --> 01:14:07,291
that,

2893
01:14:07,291 --> 01:14:10,050
remember that picture of him standing
around with a bunch of kettle bells.

2894
01:14:10,170 --> 01:14:11,130
This fucking him.

2895
01:14:11,131 --> 01:14:12,220
He's got some body fat

2896
01:14:12,220 --> 01:14:12,491
on him.

2897
01:14:12,491 --> 01:14:13,660
He always had body fat on him,

2898
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:15,250
but he was fucking big.

2899
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,730
I went back and watched the
Fajita fight again the other day.

2900
01:14:18,940 --> 01:14:20,110
He was big.

2901
01:14:20,230 --> 01:14:23,260
He was way bigger than he was
when he fought Dan Henderson.

2902
01:14:23,261 --> 01:14:23,550
Yeah.

2903
01:14:23,550 --> 01:14:23,860
Yeah.

2904
01:14:23,860 --> 01:14:25,180
By the time he fought Dan Henderson,

2905
01:14:25,181 --> 01:14:26,560
he kind of already checked out.

2906
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:28,970
He was no longer know,

2907
01:14:28,980 --> 01:14:29,700
want more weights.

2908
01:14:29,700 --> 01:14:30,533
Oh I slept hook.

2909
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:32,270
[inaudible] is and and uh,

2910
01:14:32,610 --> 01:14:34,200
Ricardo Lamas are going Outta here.

2911
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:35,580
Diaz keeps landing that,

2912
01:14:35,790 --> 01:14:36,810
that overhand right.

2913
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:43,120
That is a fight that a
punch really kind of funny,

2914
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:47,170
that big loopy over and you almost never
see in box and you see it constantly in

2915
01:14:47,171 --> 01:14:47,530
MMA.

2916
01:14:47,530 --> 01:14:47,861
Yeah.

2917
01:14:47,861 --> 01:14:49,480
Cause those little gloves,

2918
01:14:49,481 --> 01:14:50,230
it can fit.

2919
01:14:50,230 --> 01:14:50,920
It always lands.

2920
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:52,620
Why it's so interesting
when you watch the uh,

2921
01:14:52,621 --> 01:14:57,550
the differences in the way guys cover up
like in glory or in k one where so many

2922
01:14:57,551 --> 01:14:58,361
guys do that.

2923
01:14:58,361 --> 01:14:59,500
Classic Dutch.

2924
01:14:59,520 --> 01:14:59,890
Yeah.

2925
01:14:59,890 --> 01:15:01,720
Hold their hands up high guard.

2926
01:15:01,721 --> 01:15:02,650
Like you know,

2927
01:15:02,740 --> 01:15:06,970
up to the eyebrows oooooo hard leg kick
at the Bell Diaz is that says this is a

2928
01:15:06,971 --> 01:15:09,040
tough fight for Ricardo Lamas.

2929
01:15:09,041 --> 01:15:10,750
As long as it's coming off a title fight,

2930
01:15:10,900 --> 01:15:12,720
would love to prove that
he's still a top guy.

2931
01:15:12,750 --> 01:15:16,300
Not a lot to gain in this fight
because Hakan Diaz is not a big name,

2932
01:15:16,690 --> 01:15:18,010
but he's a bad motherfucker.

2933
01:15:19,020 --> 01:15:19,730
Okay.

2934
01:15:19,730 --> 01:15:21,640
Is also no on same team.

2935
01:15:21,650 --> 01:15:22,231
I don't think.

2936
01:15:22,231 --> 01:15:23,670
They didn't talk about here's what I did.

2937
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:24,753
Of course,

2938
01:15:25,060 --> 01:15:26,290
this is how you beat this guy.

2939
01:15:26,490 --> 01:15:26,890
Yeah.

2940
01:15:26,890 --> 01:15:28,810
Interesting that they
all move the same too.

2941
01:15:28,870 --> 01:15:29,703
Yeah.

2942
01:15:29,890 --> 01:15:30,600
Like uh,

2943
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:30,970
you know,

2944
01:15:30,970 --> 01:15:32,440
you see that in Borow too,

2945
01:15:32,620 --> 01:15:34,120
very similar in their movements.

2946
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:36,850
The defensive like the way they,

2947
01:15:36,851 --> 01:15:37,420
I mean they,

2948
01:15:37,420 --> 01:15:38,710
they let loose a little different,

2949
01:15:39,070 --> 01:15:40,900
but it's like the defense
is always the same,

2950
01:15:40,901 --> 01:15:42,970
just very tight.

2951
01:15:43,530 --> 01:15:44,080
It's pretty.

2952
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:47,320
That's why I was so amazed
at Tj Dillashaw so amazed.

2953
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:49,810
I'd never seen a guy rise
to the moment like that.

2954
01:15:49,811 --> 01:15:50,520
Good.

2955
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:50,900
That,

2956
01:15:50,900 --> 01:15:51,581
that was incredible.

2957
01:15:51,581 --> 01:15:52,391
That was incredible.

2958
01:15:52,391 --> 01:15:53,200
It was one of the like,

2959
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:54,033
like I thought,

2960
01:15:54,070 --> 01:15:54,371
well,

2961
01:15:54,371 --> 01:15:54,681
he can,

2962
01:15:54,681 --> 01:15:56,470
he's going to make it
a good fight out of it.

2963
01:15:56,471 --> 01:15:57,460
It's really interesting.

2964
01:15:57,461 --> 01:15:58,121
Maybe you could win.

2965
01:15:58,121 --> 01:15:58,870
Who knows?

2966
01:15:58,870 --> 01:15:59,890
Who knows what's going to happen,

2967
01:16:00,070 --> 01:16:03,910
but you're dealing with a guy in Hanan
Barao who was undefeated for nine years,

2968
01:16:04,180 --> 01:16:07,860
30 fucking fights without
a loss and meanwhile TJ,

2969
01:16:07,870 --> 01:16:10,500
just random over random over after that,

2970
01:16:10,530 --> 01:16:11,380
that when he dropped him,

2971
01:16:11,381 --> 01:16:12,214
that was just,

2972
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:13,333
he was,

2973
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:14,650
he went back in the corner.

2974
01:16:14,651 --> 01:16:15,700
He had no idea what was going on.

2975
01:16:15,970 --> 01:16:17,320
When he was going into the fourth round,

2976
01:16:17,321 --> 01:16:18,670
he asked him if he was winning the fight.

2977
01:16:18,940 --> 01:16:20,410
He had no idea what was going on.

2978
01:16:20,850 --> 01:16:24,320
That is one of the scariest
things to see as not just an MMA,

2979
01:16:24,340 --> 01:16:24,720
but you know,

2980
01:16:24,720 --> 01:16:25,770
football or whatever.

2981
01:16:26,130 --> 01:16:26,963
If a,

2982
01:16:27,510 --> 01:16:31,740
when you see someone's brain
just get rewired and you go,

2983
01:16:31,950 --> 01:16:33,060
they're asking where they are.

2984
01:16:33,061 --> 01:16:33,870
They're asking one rounded.

2985
01:16:33,870 --> 01:16:34,110
They don't.

2986
01:16:34,110 --> 01:16:35,520
They just don't know what's going on.

2987
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:39,090
Mad happens quickly
and guys want on a for.

2988
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:40,290
I've had people ask me,

2989
01:16:40,350 --> 01:16:40,980
did I,

2990
01:16:40,980 --> 01:16:41,880
what happened to fight?

2991
01:16:42,450 --> 01:16:43,740
They fought five rounds and they're going,

2992
01:16:43,741 --> 01:16:44,574
what happened?

2993
01:16:44,940 --> 01:16:45,773
You know what's scary?

2994
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:46,830
Scary to look at it.

2995
01:16:46,830 --> 01:16:47,580
That's scary.

2996
01:16:47,580 --> 01:16:48,720
But that's post fight.

2997
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:51,180
What's scary than that is a
dude who's not even fighting,

2998
01:16:51,181 --> 01:16:55,140
who tells you the same story three
times in 10 minutes and you go,

2999
01:16:55,230 --> 01:16:56,940
oh no.

3000
01:16:57,030 --> 01:16:57,930
Oh No.

3001
01:16:58,170 --> 01:17:01,530
I used to know you before you used
to do this and now you're doing this.

3002
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:04,290
Now you don't remember saying what
you just said five minutes ago.

3003
01:17:04,291 --> 01:17:05,130
You're saying it again.

3004
01:17:06,690 --> 01:17:08,610
So Ricardo Lamas has Diaz is back here.

3005
01:17:08,611 --> 01:17:09,444
That's kind of,

3006
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:10,333
and he's,

3007
01:17:10,370 --> 01:17:11,450
he's tried to take them down.

3008
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:11,930
Wow.

3009
01:17:11,930 --> 01:17:13,250
Bold Ricardo Lamas.

3010
01:17:13,430 --> 01:17:14,420
Try to prove a point.

3011
01:17:14,690 --> 01:17:15,231
Good knees,

3012
01:17:15,231 --> 01:17:15,771
those land,

3013
01:17:15,771 --> 01:17:16,490
some good knees.

3014
01:17:16,490 --> 01:17:17,241
He's a good wrestler.

3015
01:17:17,241 --> 01:17:17,810
Llamas.

3016
01:17:17,810 --> 01:17:17,991
Yeah,

3017
01:17:17,991 --> 01:17:20,180
he is so fucking great
ground and pound guy,

3018
01:17:20,181 --> 01:17:20,391
man.

3019
01:17:20,391 --> 01:17:20,810
It's ground up.

3020
01:17:20,810 --> 01:17:21,501
Pounds Nasty.

3021
01:17:21,501 --> 01:17:23,180
But this position is,

3022
01:17:23,210 --> 01:17:23,391
you're,

3023
01:17:23,391 --> 01:17:23,631
you know,

3024
01:17:23,631 --> 01:17:23,930
you're,

3025
01:17:23,930 --> 01:17:25,160
you're in a tricky spot here.

3026
01:17:25,210 --> 01:17:26,800
The other way to look at it though is,

3027
01:17:26,801 --> 01:17:28,360
is he not liking what
he's seen on the feet?

3028
01:17:28,361 --> 01:17:28,740
Exactly.

3029
01:17:28,740 --> 01:17:29,950
A lot of those right hands,

3030
01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:30,893
that leg kick on the,

3031
01:17:30,910 --> 01:17:31,630
at the bell.

3032
01:17:31,630 --> 01:17:32,331
That was a hard way.

3033
01:17:32,331 --> 01:17:32,841
I was a good one.

3034
01:17:32,841 --> 01:17:33,674
Saw them around.

3035
01:17:35,390 --> 01:17:36,700
When a guy does something different,

3036
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:37,311
you also go,

3037
01:17:37,311 --> 01:17:37,461
well,

3038
01:17:37,461 --> 01:17:39,440
what motivated him to do that
for gold grade on the feet?

3039
01:17:39,441 --> 01:17:40,274
He wouldn't be doing that.

3040
01:17:40,310 --> 01:17:40,580
Yup.

3041
01:17:40,580 --> 01:17:41,211
Very good point.

3042
01:17:41,211 --> 01:17:42,110
And then gets away.

3043
01:17:44,060 --> 01:17:46,370
So Diaz gets away without a doubt.

3044
01:17:46,371 --> 01:17:47,360
He's looking for that kick.

3045
01:17:48,860 --> 01:17:49,450
Okay.

3046
01:17:49,450 --> 01:17:51,020
It's interesting too because uh,

3047
01:17:51,150 --> 01:17:51,441
the,

3048
01:17:51,441 --> 01:17:56,200
the big kick of Aldo was something that
lamas really worried about going into

3049
01:17:56,201 --> 01:17:57,340
that fight or shouldn't say worried.

3050
01:17:57,350 --> 01:17:58,240
He knew that it was,

3051
01:17:58,241 --> 01:17:58,420
uh,

3052
01:17:58,420 --> 01:18:00,790
there was another one who
I knew knew it was coming,

3053
01:18:00,910 --> 01:18:02,980
but did a really good job in defending,

3054
01:18:02,981 --> 01:18:03,161
I mean,

3055
01:18:03,161 --> 01:18:05,050
he was fine in the fifth round.

3056
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:05,261
I mean,

3057
01:18:05,261 --> 01:18:07,120
obviously he got tagged a bunch of times,

3058
01:18:07,270 --> 01:18:09,280
but you saw no noticeable limping.

3059
01:18:09,281 --> 01:18:12,160
He wasn't noticeably
diminished because of it.

3060
01:18:12,340 --> 01:18:13,173
Yeah.

3061
01:18:14,070 --> 01:18:14,460
Okay.

3062
01:18:14,460 --> 01:18:18,390
But here he's just taking a few in this
first round and the second he didn't

3063
01:18:18,391 --> 01:18:18,810
want,

3064
01:18:18,810 --> 01:18:21,600
he doesn't want and I was
like kicks and what's funny is

3065
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:25,740
we were talking a little about cornering
and if a guys getting kicked in the leg

3066
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:26,851
and they go in the corner,

3067
01:18:26,851 --> 01:18:28,410
it goes check the kicks,

3068
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:29,431
checking.

3069
01:18:29,431 --> 01:18:30,600
If you haven't trained it,

3070
01:18:30,630 --> 01:18:32,490
it doesn't come fucking naturally.

3071
01:18:32,491 --> 01:18:34,080
You don't learn how to check
in the middle of a fight.

3072
01:18:34,530 --> 01:18:35,363
You know where they go.

3073
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:36,600
You know people ask me,

3074
01:18:36,601 --> 01:18:36,721
Oh,

3075
01:18:36,721 --> 01:18:37,850
should he start checking those kicks Mike?

3076
01:18:37,890 --> 01:18:39,450
If he hasn't been doing in training,

3077
01:18:39,630 --> 01:18:40,860
it's not going to work now.

3078
01:18:40,861 --> 01:18:44,160
It's really counterintuitive to like
turn your Shin toward a guy was kicking

3079
01:18:44,161 --> 01:18:44,480
you.

3080
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:45,660
It's never going to happen.

3081
01:18:45,690 --> 01:18:47,250
You're going to think about
it and it will be too late.

3082
01:18:47,251 --> 01:18:47,791
It'll be too late,

3083
01:18:47,791 --> 01:18:48,150
man.

3084
01:18:48,150 --> 01:18:49,200
It's very tough to do.

3085
01:18:49,260 --> 01:18:52,290
It's like slipped the punches if
you don't know how to sleep on

3086
01:18:55,160 --> 01:18:56,330
her hands up like anybody

3087
01:18:58,380 --> 01:18:59,650
vicious left hook too.

3088
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:00,450
Damn.

3089
01:19:00,450 --> 01:19:01,201
Oh Man.

3090
01:19:01,201 --> 01:19:02,160
Why was this still in?

3091
01:19:02,161 --> 01:19:03,300
It is an animal.

3092
01:19:03,330 --> 01:19:05,070
That was a nice combination.

3093
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:05,311
Yeah,

3094
01:19:05,311 --> 01:19:05,511
he's,

3095
01:19:05,511 --> 01:19:06,540
he was in trouble there.

3096
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:09,570
The kid has tremendous resolve.

3097
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:11,310
Tremendous mental resolve.

3098
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:14,780
Look at this pillow take down.

3099
01:19:15,540 --> 01:19:16,080
Yeah.

3100
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:18,690
And as a little tire it takes
a big deep breath right there.

3101
01:19:18,900 --> 01:19:19,770
Thinking about that.

3102
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:20,990
That can be a little disheartening.

3103
01:19:20,991 --> 01:19:23,150
Hitting somebody with a punch like
that and they come right back at you.

3104
01:19:23,210 --> 01:19:24,100
Hit him with suck.

3105
01:19:24,110 --> 01:19:25,700
Read three mean ones,

3106
01:19:25,701 --> 01:19:26,690
three clean ones.

3107
01:19:32,370 --> 01:19:35,250
Do you think there's too many fighters
in MMA right now for the amount of fights

3108
01:19:35,251 --> 01:19:36,084
that are available?

3109
01:19:37,450 --> 01:19:38,141
Too many fighter.

3110
01:19:38,141 --> 01:19:38,800
Too many.

3111
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:41,230
You know people were talking
about the UFC has 500 fighters.

3112
01:19:41,410 --> 01:19:42,630
I don't know how many belts or has,

3113
01:19:42,670 --> 01:19:43,770
but they just cut you guys.

3114
01:19:43,771 --> 01:19:44,604
They just cut a bunch.

3115
01:19:46,490 --> 01:19:47,890
They cut a hundred fighters.

3116
01:19:48,190 --> 01:19:48,641
Holy Shit,

3117
01:19:48,641 --> 01:19:49,300
I didn't know that.

3118
01:19:49,300 --> 01:19:49,570
Yup.

3119
01:19:49,570 --> 01:19:52,060
19 or 20 you know Scott Coker,

3120
01:19:52,061 --> 01:19:53,380
just clean shop.

3121
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:54,233
Scott said,

3122
01:19:54,430 --> 01:19:55,530
I think Scott's going to run that shit.

3123
01:19:55,531 --> 01:19:56,291
Very smart guy.

3124
01:19:56,291 --> 01:19:56,831
Very different.

3125
01:19:56,831 --> 01:19:57,581
Very good guides.

3126
01:19:57,581 --> 01:19:58,414
A lot of changes.

3127
01:19:58,420 --> 01:20:00,640
Really like universally liked.

3128
01:20:00,690 --> 01:20:00,910
Yeah.

3129
01:20:00,910 --> 01:20:01,743
Which is

3130
01:20:01,750 --> 01:20:03,070
unheard of in the fight world.

3131
01:20:03,071 --> 01:20:03,640
Hard,

3132
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:04,970
unheard of in the fight world.

3133
01:20:04,971 --> 01:20:07,090
So can you say universally
liked with Dana White?

3134
01:20:08,330 --> 01:20:09,180
I like Dana.

3135
01:20:09,190 --> 01:20:09,871
I like him a lot.

3136
01:20:09,871 --> 01:20:11,130
He's one of my good friends.

3137
01:20:11,131 --> 01:20:12,960
I love the guy but shit,

3138
01:20:14,550 --> 01:20:16,770
I mean you can go on
the underground any day.

3139
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:18,660
Well you can find threads about anybody,

3140
01:20:18,870 --> 01:20:20,880
any hate threads on the underground.

3141
01:20:23,980 --> 01:20:24,850
I get hit me all the time.

3142
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:27,000
Oh minor that I'm trying
to love a lot of love.

3143
01:20:27,001 --> 01:20:27,341
I love,

3144
01:20:27,341 --> 01:20:29,340
loved the underground
and you know people like,

3145
01:20:29,580 --> 01:20:32,340
like got upset with me this week because
I was saying like there's too many

3146
01:20:32,341 --> 01:20:35,580
douche bags on online and I've
been avoiding going to forums.

3147
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:40,050
Like I get a lot out of the underground
but it's just like the Douche bags want

3148
01:20:40,051 --> 01:20:41,350
to stay douche bags.

3149
01:20:41,460 --> 01:20:43,020
They just want to stay assholes.

3150
01:20:43,290 --> 01:20:46,380
And all I'm saying is if you had a guy
over your party and he was talking to

3151
01:20:46,381 --> 01:20:48,300
people like that and when
you want them to be gone.

3152
01:20:48,410 --> 01:20:48,930
Yeah,

3153
01:20:48,930 --> 01:20:50,940
that's what would an online forum is.

3154
01:20:50,941 --> 01:20:54,780
It's a party and they want it to be
open to anybody and they don't want any

3155
01:20:54,990 --> 01:20:56,640
repercussions of their Douche,

3156
01:20:56,641 --> 01:20:57,150
Enos.

3157
01:20:57,150 --> 01:21:00,270
They don't want to take responsibility
for the way people react to the way they

3158
01:21:00,271 --> 01:21:00,830
behave.

3159
01:21:00,830 --> 01:21:01,830
Where Carl Lamas going?

3160
01:21:01,860 --> 01:21:03,150
Coming back at Diaz here,

3161
01:21:03,180 --> 01:21:04,013
man.

3162
01:21:04,310 --> 01:21:05,143
Okay.

3163
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:06,320
Is a tough motherfucker.

3164
01:21:06,330 --> 01:21:07,440
Man was good combinations.

3165
01:21:07,441 --> 01:21:08,880
Man's recovered from those shots.

3166
01:21:08,910 --> 01:21:09,181
Oh,

3167
01:21:09,181 --> 01:21:10,260
Dee has cracked him again though.

3168
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:11,190
It's moving his feet now.

3169
01:21:11,191 --> 01:21:12,030
He's actually doing flips,

3170
01:21:12,031 --> 01:21:12,330
you know,

3171
01:21:12,330 --> 01:21:12,651
angles.

3172
01:21:12,651 --> 01:21:13,484
Yeah.

3173
01:21:16,180 --> 01:21:18,010
Two rounds in exciting fight.

3174
01:21:18,550 --> 01:21:19,060
But uh,

3175
01:21:19,060 --> 01:21:19,451
you know,

3176
01:21:19,451 --> 01:21:20,350
forums are great,

3177
01:21:20,351 --> 01:21:20,710
man.

3178
01:21:20,710 --> 01:21:22,750
I get a lot of the underground,

3179
01:21:22,751 --> 01:21:23,830
I get a lot of discussion.

3180
01:21:23,860 --> 01:21:26,320
It's just like sometimes
you'll chop on there and deal,

3181
01:21:26,321 --> 01:21:31,321
just run into a wave of comments just
to just to a one Wavell hitch and some

3182
01:21:32,021 --> 01:21:33,040
guys just check out.

3183
01:21:33,041 --> 01:21:33,311
They're like,

3184
01:21:33,311 --> 01:21:33,611
all right,

3185
01:21:33,611 --> 01:21:33,801
I'm,

3186
01:21:33,801 --> 01:21:34,660
I'm done with this place.

3187
01:21:34,700 --> 01:21:35,230
Yeah.

3188
01:21:35,230 --> 01:21:39,040
I tried to say that like you guys
ran off almost all the fighters.

3189
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:42,370
There's very few guys still post
there anymore and people get upset.

3190
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:42,640
Ooh,

3191
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:43,850
food can we make goes good?

3192
01:21:43,870 --> 01:21:45,360
They're just doing want
to hear the truth and no,

3193
01:21:45,370 --> 01:21:45,471
no,

3194
01:21:45,471 --> 01:21:45,550
no,

3195
01:21:45,550 --> 01:21:46,080
no.

3196
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:46,930
Did your just to kind of,

3197
01:21:46,931 --> 01:21:47,651
you're being dead.

3198
01:21:47,651 --> 01:21:48,001
Yeah.

3199
01:21:48,001 --> 01:21:48,834
He's just being,

3200
01:21:48,890 --> 01:21:50,980
you're saying something when
you're talking to a guy,

3201
01:21:50,981 --> 01:21:51,731
like whatever,

3202
01:21:51,731 --> 01:21:52,211
it's Brian,

3203
01:21:52,211 --> 01:21:55,810
Stan or anybody you're talking in a
way online that you would never talk to

3204
01:21:55,811 --> 01:21:55,960
them.

3205
01:21:55,960 --> 01:21:56,950
If they're standing in front of you,

3206
01:21:57,130 --> 01:21:57,980
I'll fucking slap.

3207
01:21:59,300 --> 01:22:00,133
He'd have to be,

3208
01:22:00,180 --> 01:22:04,240
or you'd have to be in a
complete sociopath would if
you were bigger than them

3209
01:22:04,241 --> 01:22:05,110
and you talk to them like that.

3210
01:22:05,111 --> 01:22:07,510
Like why would you talk to someone
like that that you don't even,

3211
01:22:07,540 --> 01:22:09,310
you don't even know the guy personally.

3212
01:22:09,430 --> 01:22:10,960
You don't have a relationship with them.

3213
01:22:11,050 --> 01:22:14,560
You might think you know him if you want
to be critical of his technique or his

3214
01:22:14,561 --> 01:22:15,370
performance,

3215
01:22:15,370 --> 01:22:17,170
there's a way to do it respectfully.

3216
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:18,220
You can even be funny.

3217
01:22:18,250 --> 01:22:18,401
Yeah,

3218
01:22:18,401 --> 01:22:18,841
exactly.

3219
01:22:18,841 --> 01:22:19,870
If we're going to make it funny,

3220
01:22:19,890 --> 01:22:21,070
it's then cool.

3221
01:22:21,071 --> 01:22:22,040
Have Fun and the,

3222
01:22:22,050 --> 01:22:22,720
at least,

3223
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:23,710
if you're going to be a dick,

3224
01:22:23,740 --> 01:22:25,570
be funny and make me laugh.

3225
01:22:25,690 --> 01:22:26,200
You'll look,

3226
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:28,360
I don't like a lot of those uh,

3227
01:22:28,540 --> 01:22:33,280
mean photoshops but some of
them are fucking hilarious
of dudes that are Kol and

3228
01:22:33,310 --> 01:22:33,730
they say,

3229
01:22:33,730 --> 01:22:34,870
it says some fucked up shit.

3230
01:22:34,870 --> 01:22:37,510
Like there was some really funny ones
that people did about Rashad Evans.

3231
01:22:37,540 --> 01:22:38,620
I like Rashad a lot,

3232
01:22:38,621 --> 01:22:38,831
but the,

3233
01:22:38,831 --> 01:22:40,000
the mirror pretty fight.

3234
01:22:40,150 --> 01:22:40,931
They were funny.

3235
01:22:40,931 --> 01:22:41,764
They were funny.

3236
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:42,520
You know,

3237
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:42,941
there's,

3238
01:22:42,941 --> 01:22:44,830
that's where you could see an argument.

3239
01:22:44,860 --> 01:22:45,221
You could say,

3240
01:22:45,221 --> 01:22:45,940
well,

3241
01:22:45,940 --> 01:22:46,271
you know,

3242
01:22:46,271 --> 01:22:51,271
like I've seen a lot of photoshops
of me and very disrespectful,

3243
01:22:51,610 --> 01:22:54,280
but I think they're hilarious and
I don't want to stop them at all.

3244
01:22:54,281 --> 01:22:57,160
I've seen photoshops with
me surrounded by Dicks,

3245
01:22:57,490 --> 01:22:58,030
you know,

3246
01:22:58,030 --> 01:22:58,761
with a little,

3247
01:22:58,761 --> 01:23:01,780
a tiny woman's body
wearing girl's underwear.

3248
01:23:01,781 --> 01:23:03,660
I've seen everything and I
never have a problem with it.

3249
01:23:03,661 --> 01:23:04,494
I think it's funny,

3250
01:23:04,510 --> 01:23:06,060
as long as it's fucking key.

3251
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:11,070
Becoming as photos of Dixon owns
in Photoshop [inaudible] by Dixon.

3252
01:23:12,950 --> 01:23:13,590
It's weird.

3253
01:23:13,590 --> 01:23:14,560
It was just Tuesday,

3254
01:23:16,140 --> 01:23:18,200
my buddy goes on on Diaz again.

3255
01:23:18,490 --> 01:23:19,490
Welcome to early MMA.

3256
01:23:19,510 --> 01:23:19,721
Right?

3257
01:23:19,721 --> 01:23:20,290
Seriously,

3258
01:23:20,290 --> 01:23:22,180
I get a lot of criticism though.

3259
01:23:22,181 --> 01:23:22,840
I really do.

3260
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:23,830
I get a lot out of,

3261
01:23:23,831 --> 01:23:24,640
um,

3262
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:28,300
just even if I don't agree with
like them being hypercritical,

3263
01:23:28,301 --> 01:23:29,830
you see a point of view,

3264
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:30,341
you know,

3265
01:23:30,341 --> 01:23:33,130
you see their point of view and
maybe you see how it was back.

3266
01:23:33,340 --> 01:23:33,821
Oh Yeah,

3267
01:23:33,821 --> 01:23:34,571
look at this Lama.

3268
01:23:34,571 --> 01:23:35,710
So she is back.

3269
01:23:35,711 --> 01:23:36,700
This is incredible.

3270
01:23:36,850 --> 01:23:37,900
He's got a full naked,

3271
01:23:37,980 --> 01:23:38,890
they could choke.

3272
01:23:38,980 --> 01:23:39,371
I can't.

3273
01:23:39,371 --> 01:23:40,420
We can't sell DVDs from here,

3274
01:23:40,421 --> 01:23:41,440
but look at it.

3275
01:23:41,441 --> 01:23:42,790
He's trying to go palm to palm.

3276
01:23:42,910 --> 01:23:43,121
Oh,

3277
01:23:43,121 --> 01:23:47,620
he might have his on his
fucking Chin and he did.

3278
01:23:47,621 --> 01:23:49,660
What Ronda Rousey did with e.

3279
01:23:49,661 --> 01:23:50,021
Dot.

3280
01:23:50,021 --> 01:23:50,290
Him.

3281
01:23:50,290 --> 01:23:54,700
He let go of the defense of the neck just
to get rid of the hooks and then threw

3282
01:23:54,701 --> 01:23:55,270
them off.

3283
01:23:55,270 --> 01:23:56,103
Wow.

3284
01:23:56,440 --> 01:23:57,670
Strong confidence in his neck.

3285
01:23:57,790 --> 01:23:59,650
The number one thing I get
is that I'm trying to be you.

3286
01:24:00,220 --> 01:24:02,380
It's a number one criticism that
we're number one asshole thing.

3287
01:24:02,381 --> 01:24:03,310
I get to express.

3288
01:24:03,330 --> 01:24:04,780
I'm trying to be Joe Rogan.

3289
01:24:04,781 --> 01:24:04,901
Why?

3290
01:24:04,901 --> 01:24:05,050
What?

3291
01:24:05,050 --> 01:24:07,720
They don't know his head shaved years.

3292
01:24:07,721 --> 01:24:08,554
Years ago.

3293
01:24:09,430 --> 01:24:10,420
I totally copied.

3294
01:24:10,421 --> 01:24:11,890
You can since high school.

3295
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:14,171
True Story.

3296
01:24:14,171 --> 01:24:15,040
My Mom's slot.

3297
01:24:15,041 --> 01:24:16,180
Lama says the fucking kids.

3298
01:24:16,181 --> 01:24:17,860
He now on these going to get it.

3299
01:24:17,861 --> 01:24:18,401
Oh Man.

3300
01:24:18,401 --> 01:24:20,860
It's amazing though that he's the
one who's threatening with chokes.

3301
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:23,410
He's cat to real close submissions.

3302
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:25,120
Where's DSA and had shit on him.

3303
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:27,790
I see Black Belt Cochran or Ricardo?

3304
01:24:28,130 --> 01:24:28,963
Ricardo.

3305
01:24:29,010 --> 01:24:29,843
Ricardo's.

3306
01:24:30,120 --> 01:24:30,490
Yeah.

3307
01:24:30,490 --> 01:24:32,450
Your hotline is a big black posts,

3308
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:33,210
but that's their,

3309
01:24:33,210 --> 01:24:34,660
their criticisms are ridiculous.

3310
01:24:35,140 --> 01:24:36,730
You just get excited like I do.

3311
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:38,350
Everybody sees somebody hit get goes,

3312
01:24:38,410 --> 01:24:39,150
oh,

3313
01:24:39,150 --> 01:24:40,510
that's what you do.

3314
01:24:40,750 --> 01:24:41,351
It's funny,

3315
01:24:41,351 --> 01:24:42,184
man.

3316
01:24:42,340 --> 01:24:43,720
My mom wants got US mixed up.

3317
01:24:43,721 --> 01:24:44,554
I'm not kidding.

3318
01:24:45,020 --> 01:24:46,000
Literally watched it.

3319
01:24:47,020 --> 01:24:50,200
I was literally watching
UFC at my mother's house.

3320
01:24:50,350 --> 01:24:51,230
She was making dinner.

3321
01:24:51,231 --> 01:24:52,670
It's just phenomenal cook or are there,

3322
01:24:52,690 --> 01:24:55,930
she's making it and I'm watching UFC
and she comes in the room in the living

3323
01:24:55,931 --> 01:24:56,021
room.

3324
01:24:56,021 --> 01:24:56,854
She goes,

3325
01:24:57,340 --> 01:24:57,521
oh,

3326
01:24:57,521 --> 01:24:58,301
it's one of your fights.

3327
01:24:58,301 --> 01:24:58,511
I go,

3328
01:24:58,511 --> 01:24:58,691
no,

3329
01:24:58,691 --> 01:24:58,971
mom,

3330
01:24:58,971 --> 01:24:59,804
Miss Joe Rogan.

3331
01:25:01,290 --> 01:25:01,991
It looks like you.

3332
01:25:01,991 --> 01:25:03,100
And I asked him off.

3333
01:25:05,050 --> 01:25:06,880
My fucking mom got US mixed up.

3334
01:25:06,910 --> 01:25:07,930
Oh Dad.

3335
01:25:07,990 --> 01:25:08,823
It was funny.

3336
01:25:09,220 --> 01:25:10,001
I was laughing.

3337
01:25:10,001 --> 01:25:10,420
It's funny.

3338
01:25:10,420 --> 01:25:11,380
That's hilarious.

3339
01:25:11,990 --> 01:25:12,380
We're,

3340
01:25:12,380 --> 01:25:12,811
but you know,

3341
01:25:12,811 --> 01:25:14,600
White Guy Tattoos.

3342
01:25:14,601 --> 01:25:15,434
You know?

3343
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:16,510
Why can't I see it?

3344
01:25:16,511 --> 01:25:17,344
The same shape.

3345
01:25:17,570 --> 01:25:18,101
No hair.

3346
01:25:18,101 --> 01:25:18,934
Who Yell a lot.

3347
01:25:19,190 --> 01:25:20,023
Yeah,

3348
01:25:21,130 --> 01:25:21,541
we do.

3349
01:25:21,541 --> 01:25:21,881
Yo,

3350
01:25:21,881 --> 01:25:23,800
a part of our job was,

3351
01:25:23,801 --> 01:25:24,970
that's entertaining then.

3352
01:25:24,971 --> 01:25:29,140
That's another thing about you and I
that I really enjoy the fact that we're

3353
01:25:29,141 --> 01:25:29,891
very friendly.

3354
01:25:29,891 --> 01:25:32,860
We'd like to turn the best friends
and we're supposed to be like,

3355
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:34,000
come splatter the enemies.

3356
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:34,811
We're supposed to eat while I'm in there,

3357
01:25:34,811 --> 01:25:35,170
I guess,

3358
01:25:35,170 --> 01:25:35,891
which is ridiculous.

3359
01:25:35,891 --> 01:25:37,390
I tried to get the UFC to hire him.

3360
01:25:38,050 --> 01:25:38,970
I totally did.

3361
01:25:38,980 --> 01:25:39,701
I really did,

3362
01:25:39,701 --> 01:25:40,990
but when I told Dana White,

3363
01:25:40,991 --> 01:25:41,920
I had a conversation with them.

3364
01:25:41,921 --> 01:25:42,260
I said,

3365
01:25:42,260 --> 01:25:43,120
the guy is awesome.

3366
01:25:43,270 --> 01:25:43,571
I go,

3367
01:25:43,571 --> 01:25:44,890
I think he's the best guy out there.

3368
01:25:45,070 --> 01:25:46,570
I really think he's really good.

3369
01:25:46,571 --> 01:25:46,950
I go,

3370
01:25:46,950 --> 01:25:48,220
UFC should hire him.

3371
01:25:48,340 --> 01:25:48,641
I go,

3372
01:25:48,641 --> 01:25:49,810
I don't know when his contract is up,

3373
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:51,160
but you guys should find out.

3374
01:25:51,220 --> 01:25:52,090
So they looked in.

3375
01:25:52,091 --> 01:25:55,150
They found that when his contract was up
and then they even started like trying

3376
01:25:55,151 --> 01:25:55,810
to get them.

3377
01:25:55,810 --> 01:25:56,850
But then Viacom,

3378
01:25:56,950 --> 01:25:58,450
there's a lot of money being involved.

3379
01:25:58,451 --> 01:25:59,171
Lawyers,

3380
01:25:59,171 --> 01:26:00,430
lawsuits threatened.

3381
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:01,360
Did you get paid more?

3382
01:26:01,450 --> 01:26:01,900
Anyhow,

3383
01:26:01,900 --> 01:26:02,790
he scared me.

3384
01:26:03,350 --> 01:26:04,290
Really scare

3385
01:26:04,290 --> 01:26:04,521
me.

3386
01:26:04,521 --> 01:26:05,090
Eddie Alvarez.

3387
01:26:05,090 --> 01:26:05,241
Ooh,

3388
01:26:05,241 --> 01:26:06,074
look at this.

3389
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:07,393
Look at this.

3390
01:26:07,670 --> 01:26:08,520
He's a fucking chore.

3391
01:26:08,570 --> 01:26:09,403
Control

3392
01:26:11,780 --> 01:26:12,980
inside control.

3393
01:26:13,790 --> 01:26:14,240
Okay.

3394
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:15,110
Incredible.

3395
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:17,420
Incredible performance
on the ground by llamas.

3396
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:18,770
Lost the over under.

3397
01:26:19,310 --> 01:26:19,551
Oh,

3398
01:26:19,551 --> 01:26:20,620
when he gets tagged by a Reit,

3399
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:22,310
how Awkward d is embarrassed right now.

3400
01:26:22,730 --> 01:26:23,930
Must be embarrassed.

3401
01:26:24,380 --> 01:26:25,790
You look at this lamas on top of him.

3402
01:26:25,791 --> 01:26:26,960
Good Cardio by llamas.

3403
01:26:26,961 --> 01:26:27,440
Huh?

3404
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:28,060
He's coming back.

3405
01:26:28,060 --> 01:26:29,060
Nice kick to the body.

3406
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:30,500
He's just aggressive the whole time.

3407
01:26:31,010 --> 01:26:31,550
But yeah,

3408
01:26:31,550 --> 01:26:33,350
I really wanted the UFC to hire Jimmy,

3409
01:26:33,860 --> 01:26:34,693
you know?

3410
01:26:34,760 --> 01:26:35,330
Um,

3411
01:26:35,330 --> 01:26:37,040
if I did even less events,

3412
01:26:37,070 --> 01:26:37,510
I don't know.

3413
01:26:37,510 --> 01:26:38,960
I like watching it at home.

3414
01:26:39,020 --> 01:26:39,853
I'm happy with that.

3415
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:42,870
But there's so many events
that they're doing now.

3416
01:26:42,871 --> 01:26:43,770
They're doing two a day.

3417
01:26:44,030 --> 01:26:45,450
A lot two of them happened today.

3418
01:26:45,451 --> 01:26:48,780
One of them was in New Zealand and this
one here is happening in San Antonio to

3419
01:26:48,781 --> 01:26:49,614
different teams.

3420
01:26:49,650 --> 01:26:49,981
You know,

3421
01:26:49,981 --> 01:26:54,981
they had anak and I'm Florian are doing
this one or anak and Stan and Stan

3422
01:26:55,530 --> 01:26:57,870
Florian and Goldie got
shipped off to New Zealand

3423
01:27:00,630 --> 01:27:01,800
for a fight pass.

3424
01:27:02,580 --> 01:27:04,170
Marquardt looked fucking great.

3425
01:27:05,130 --> 01:27:06,630
Mark Clark looked really good.

3426
01:27:06,780 --> 01:27:07,530
It was a nap.

3427
01:27:07,530 --> 01:27:08,040
The arm bar.

3428
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:09,450
He said TRT issues.

3429
01:27:09,570 --> 01:27:10,950
Did those get cleared up or no?

3430
01:27:11,310 --> 01:27:12,510
Am I going to find out someday?

3431
01:27:12,540 --> 01:27:13,970
I guess we're gonna find out soon.

3432
01:27:14,470 --> 01:27:15,390
You never know.

3433
01:27:15,490 --> 01:27:15,791
Take it.

3434
01:27:15,791 --> 01:27:17,100
The vet a couple of hours.

3435
01:27:17,160 --> 01:27:18,030
It is,

3436
01:27:18,470 --> 01:27:18,760
yeah.

3437
01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:20,710
I told somebody a couple days ago,

3438
01:27:20,711 --> 01:27:21,040
it's,

3439
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:22,360
there wasn't a lady who swallowed a fly.

3440
01:27:22,361 --> 01:27:23,194
I remember that poem.

3441
01:27:23,470 --> 01:27:24,050
Yes,

3442
01:27:24,050 --> 01:27:24,670
she swatted,

3443
01:27:24,670 --> 01:27:25,910
swallowed a spider to catch a fly.

3444
01:27:25,911 --> 01:27:27,670
Just fall to bird swallow the spider.

3445
01:27:28,060 --> 01:27:29,250
Once you start doing,

3446
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:29,501
oh,

3447
01:27:29,501 --> 01:27:31,570
I was on this because I was
on TRT because I did this,

3448
01:27:31,571 --> 01:27:32,180
I was getting bitches,

3449
01:27:32,180 --> 01:27:32,830
I'd take this.

3450
01:27:32,830 --> 01:27:34,810
So it's just an endless stream.

3451
01:27:35,140 --> 01:27:36,460
When you start messing with that man,

3452
01:27:36,461 --> 01:27:37,780
it's an endless stream of shit.

3453
01:27:37,870 --> 01:27:38,410
Yeah.

3454
01:27:38,410 --> 01:27:41,560
And that's where shale wells
and so it's out on bloody elbow.

3455
01:27:41,561 --> 01:27:42,610
So we can talk about it,

3456
01:27:42,611 --> 01:27:42,970
right?

3457
01:27:42,970 --> 01:27:43,241
Yes,

3458
01:27:43,241 --> 01:27:45,610
we can cause jail.

3459
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:46,513
Um,

3460
01:27:46,570 --> 01:27:48,880
he's in a situation now where,

3461
01:27:48,940 --> 01:27:49,360
uh,

3462
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:53,980
he got popped for a bunch of different
shit that he was taking to try to recover

3463
01:27:53,981 --> 01:27:56,050
from the fact that he was on TRT.

3464
01:27:56,051 --> 01:28:00,110
And then what people people don't
understand is when you get off a tee,

3465
01:28:00,180 --> 01:28:01,000
TRT,

3466
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:05,650
your body takes a long time to recover
and get back to a point where it's

3467
01:28:05,651 --> 01:28:07,750
producing a natural level of testosterone.

3468
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:11,440
So guys take things to try
to reboot their system.

3469
01:28:11,650 --> 01:28:14,860
And the things that he tested positive
for from the Nevada state athletic

3470
01:28:14,861 --> 01:28:17,050
commission were in those groups.

3471
01:28:17,051 --> 01:28:21,850
The groups have a estrogen inhibitors
that they use to try to boost your

3472
01:28:21,851 --> 01:28:22,750
testosterone.

3473
01:28:23,110 --> 01:28:24,340
But they,

3474
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:25,480
the UFC,

3475
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:30,310
they went through the most comprehensive
drug testing that they could possibly

3476
01:28:30,311 --> 01:28:31,030
get.

3477
01:28:31,030 --> 01:28:33,700
This thing that costs $45,000 per fighter.

3478
01:28:33,970 --> 01:28:34,730
And uh,

3479
01:28:34,730 --> 01:28:35,800
the guy shows up,

3480
01:28:35,801 --> 01:28:36,760
takes the blood,

3481
01:28:36,940 --> 01:28:38,410
leaves in a suitcase,

3482
01:28:38,411 --> 01:28:40,300
they have a chain of custody of the blood,

3483
01:28:40,420 --> 01:28:42,100
flies with it on a plane.

3484
01:28:42,101 --> 01:28:43,330
Like he's fucking handcuffed to it.

3485
01:28:43,331 --> 01:28:44,050
Like it's a,

3486
01:28:44,050 --> 01:28:45,640
like the nuclear button.

3487
01:28:45,670 --> 01:28:46,421
Nuclear codes.

3488
01:28:46,421 --> 01:28:46,780
Yeah.

3489
01:28:46,780 --> 01:28:51,670
And they did this to jail and he
tested positive for HGH and EPO,

3490
01:28:51,700 --> 01:28:56,700
which are not part of that group
now for post a testosterone therapy.

3491
01:28:57,701 --> 01:28:58,640
So he had h,

3492
01:28:58,641 --> 01:28:58,951
g,

3493
01:28:58,951 --> 01:29:02,220
h she had EPO and then he had

3494
01:29:02,220 --> 01:29:05,440
clomiphene and Anna Straws.

3495
01:29:05,441 --> 01:29:07,200
So on a struggle.

3496
01:29:07,710 --> 01:29:09,750
So apparently what,

3497
01:29:09,810 --> 01:29:11,160
you know what I think it is,

3498
01:29:11,161 --> 01:29:14,880
is he was just trying to just do
something to jack up a system,

3499
01:29:14,910 --> 01:29:15,240
get,

3500
01:29:15,240 --> 01:29:16,710
get the fucking fires burning.

3501
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:18,810
But how many guys are on each change?

3502
01:29:19,220 --> 01:29:20,053
A ton.

3503
01:29:20,190 --> 01:29:21,700
Is it 90% what is it?

3504
01:29:22,020 --> 01:29:24,450
Is it 60 what's the number?

3505
01:29:24,750 --> 01:29:25,350
You know,

3506
01:29:25,350 --> 01:29:26,183
it's a lot.

3507
01:29:26,310 --> 01:29:27,630
A lot of guys aren't HGH.

3508
01:29:28,050 --> 01:29:28,883
Why?

3509
01:29:29,230 --> 01:29:30,063
Drum roll.

3510
01:29:31,580 --> 01:29:32,740
Cause it was,

3511
01:29:33,510 --> 01:29:35,460
it works weird.

3512
01:29:36,420 --> 01:29:36,900
Yeah.

3513
01:29:36,900 --> 01:29:38,610
There's a lot of stuff that that works.

3514
01:29:38,670 --> 01:29:40,050
And for years it wasn't testable.

3515
01:29:40,051 --> 01:29:40,850
Now yeah,

3516
01:29:40,850 --> 01:29:41,180
they,

3517
01:29:41,180 --> 01:29:42,390
they have developed that test,

3518
01:29:42,391 --> 01:29:45,060
but at it being that expensive,

3519
01:29:45,061 --> 01:29:46,140
they can't use it on everybody.

3520
01:29:46,141 --> 01:29:47,100
If it's 45 grand a pop,

3521
01:29:47,160 --> 01:29:47,431
the,

3522
01:29:47,431 --> 01:29:48,480
they're gonna use it on everybody.

3523
01:29:48,660 --> 01:29:49,493
Really.

3524
01:29:49,900 --> 01:29:50,550
I mean,

3525
01:29:50,550 --> 01:29:54,440
I think anytime they get no
Ricardo lamas that alarm us.

3526
01:29:54,460 --> 01:29:55,293
I think he deserved it.

3527
01:29:55,330 --> 01:29:56,163
Fuck yeah.

3528
01:29:56,190 --> 01:29:57,230
He took that fight.

3529
01:29:57,240 --> 01:29:57,900
Did,

3530
01:29:57,900 --> 01:30:00,210
I'm just amazed that he
got his back like that.

3531
01:30:00,211 --> 01:30:01,060
I'm amazed as he,

3532
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:02,113
yeah.

3533
01:30:02,210 --> 01:30:05,460
He got his bell rung and rung and kept
coming and he took some nasty fucking

3534
01:30:05,461 --> 01:30:05,771
punch.

3535
01:30:05,771 --> 01:30:06,330
Those steps.

3536
01:30:06,330 --> 01:30:06,631
One,

3537
01:30:06,631 --> 01:30:06,811
two,

3538
01:30:06,811 --> 01:30:10,380
three combination that he got hit with
then immediately secured that clinch.

3539
01:30:10,381 --> 01:30:11,400
He's a real fighter man.

3540
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:11,901
Oh Man.

3541
01:30:11,901 --> 01:30:12,391
My masters,

3542
01:30:12,391 --> 01:30:12,811
by the way,

3543
01:30:12,811 --> 01:30:14,610
the coach behind them and
my master's is a coach.

3544
01:30:14,640 --> 01:30:15,930
They're a team out of south Florida.

3545
01:30:16,230 --> 01:30:16,620
Uh,

3546
01:30:16,620 --> 01:30:19,290
we were wondering about that before
his team and everything's out of south

3547
01:30:19,291 --> 01:30:19,770
Florida.

3548
01:30:19,770 --> 01:30:20,610
That's where he's at now.

3549
01:30:20,611 --> 01:30:21,630
He's a Chicago guy.

3550
01:30:21,900 --> 01:30:22,361
I think so,

3551
01:30:22,361 --> 01:30:23,050
but I know MMS,

3552
01:30:23,050 --> 01:30:24,360
MMA masters out of south Florida.

3553
01:30:24,390 --> 01:30:24,720
Yeah.

3554
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:25,553
He um,

3555
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:27,390
she caught him on a handbrake on?

3556
01:30:27,690 --> 01:30:27,931
No,

3557
01:30:27,931 --> 01:30:28,081
no,

3558
01:30:28,081 --> 01:30:29,090
that was just the end of the fight.

3559
01:30:29,550 --> 01:30:30,190
I don't know what that is.

3560
01:30:30,190 --> 01:30:32,210
I'm looking at his hand if what
they're talking about that um,

3561
01:30:32,370 --> 01:30:33,980
we can't really hear the
auto in here by the way.

3562
01:30:34,020 --> 01:30:34,440
People,

3563
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:34,711
yeah.

3564
01:30:34,711 --> 01:30:35,550
Well I mean we could,

3565
01:30:35,551 --> 01:30:37,620
but then that runs into weird issues.

3566
01:30:37,890 --> 01:30:38,940
Like if we were,

3567
01:30:38,941 --> 01:30:39,774
um,

3568
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:41,130
if we were doing this,

3569
01:30:41,730 --> 01:30:42,141
well the,

3570
01:30:42,141 --> 01:30:44,160
the thing is it's not totally legal.

3571
01:30:46,250 --> 01:30:47,550
It's kind of on Fox.

3572
01:30:47,790 --> 01:30:48,241
Like we would,

3573
01:30:48,241 --> 01:30:51,660
we would kind of be broadcast and other
stuff kind of pirating and I kind of

3574
01:30:51,661 --> 01:30:52,500
worked for Fox,

3575
01:30:52,501 --> 01:30:53,970
kind of looked down on that.

3576
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:54,990
They frown upon that.

3577
01:30:55,020 --> 01:30:56,520
Nobody's told me to not do this,

3578
01:30:56,521 --> 01:30:57,630
but when I told them I was doing this,

3579
01:30:57,631 --> 01:30:58,464
then what?

3580
01:30:59,830 --> 01:31:00,830
This can be a fucking,

3581
01:31:01,230 --> 01:31:05,250
he might say some fucked up shit or
have a guy like Ian Mccall on will say,

3582
01:31:05,260 --> 01:31:06,450
say fucked up shit.

3583
01:31:07,580 --> 01:31:07,981
Oh good.

3584
01:31:07,981 --> 01:31:08,701
Good for Ricardo.

3585
01:31:08,701 --> 01:31:09,310
Lamas stole.

3586
01:31:09,310 --> 01:31:13,140
Cause that's a fight where he had a
lot to lose and not a lot to gain.

3587
01:31:13,350 --> 01:31:13,891
And he was late.

3588
01:31:13,891 --> 01:31:15,720
He was losing and he
wasn't in the beginning.

3589
01:31:15,860 --> 01:31:16,693
That was a great fight.

3590
01:31:17,460 --> 01:31:18,420
Very good fight for him.

3591
01:31:18,750 --> 01:31:19,141
So,

3592
01:31:19,141 --> 01:31:19,500
um,

3593
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:21,990
we were talking about glory earlier kid,

3594
01:31:22,190 --> 01:31:22,341
right?

3595
01:31:22,341 --> 01:31:23,260
That can we take them in the Ted?

3596
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:23,930
I appreciate that.

3597
01:31:23,930 --> 01:31:25,440
Gets a kid with bad data.

3598
01:31:25,500 --> 01:31:26,333
The Facebook,

3599
01:31:26,340 --> 01:31:26,881
George Saint Pierre,

3600
01:31:26,881 --> 01:31:27,714
and he was a kid.

3601
01:31:28,660 --> 01:31:30,780
There's a good legs kicks and again,

3602
01:31:30,810 --> 01:31:31,111
look,

3603
01:31:31,111 --> 01:31:33,840
what do they show when they've
tried to repay the replay?

3604
01:31:33,870 --> 01:31:35,730
It looks like it's the Ricardo Lamas show.

3605
01:31:36,180 --> 01:31:37,800
They don't show any of a wood hoc.

3606
01:31:37,801 --> 01:31:38,551
Ron Diaz did.

3607
01:31:38,551 --> 01:31:40,380
Ricardo Lamas takes him down here.

3608
01:31:40,381 --> 01:31:42,030
Ricardo Lamas Hits Him with a jab.

3609
01:31:42,180 --> 01:31:42,840
Come on man.

3610
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:44,280
In a very competitive fight.

3611
01:31:44,310 --> 01:31:45,380
The move of the fight,

3612
01:31:46,350 --> 01:31:49,640
I think the moves or fight move
of the fight should be both.

3613
01:31:49,670 --> 01:31:51,000
I'm going to talk to them about that.

3614
01:31:51,001 --> 01:31:52,500
The next event we'll
see if you listen to me.

3615
01:31:52,580 --> 01:31:53,111
Got Juice,

3616
01:31:53,111 --> 01:31:53,500
right?

3617
01:31:53,500 --> 01:31:54,930
You got to listen to you.

3618
01:31:55,050 --> 01:31:55,800
I've been around.

3619
01:31:55,800 --> 01:31:57,360
Everybody ignores me and know some things.

3620
01:31:57,361 --> 01:31:58,110
My friend.

3621
01:31:58,110 --> 01:31:58,980
Is that Joe Stevens?

3622
01:31:59,020 --> 01:31:59,853
Yup.

3623
01:32:00,130 --> 01:32:01,630
What's Joe Up to these days?

3624
01:32:01,780 --> 01:32:02,440
Joe Daddy.

3625
01:32:02,440 --> 01:32:02,890
Yeah.

3626
01:32:02,890 --> 01:32:03,723
I don't know.

3627
01:32:04,120 --> 01:32:04,390
Joe.

3628
01:32:04,390 --> 01:32:05,223
Steven.

3629
01:32:05,860 --> 01:32:06,101
Hey.

3630
01:32:06,101 --> 01:32:08,780
That kid started his MMA
career as a professional.

3631
01:32:08,990 --> 01:32:13,870
Six 16 years old man's Chris Brennan
choked him out in UFC when he was 1616

3632
01:32:13,871 --> 01:32:17,410
years old on fucking in the cage or UFC.

3633
01:32:17,530 --> 01:32:18,201
It was king in the cage.

3634
01:32:18,201 --> 01:32:19,800
So first year was the
first king of the cage.

3635
01:32:19,830 --> 01:32:20,320
Okay.

3636
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:20,800
It was.

3637
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:21,160
Yeah.

3638
01:32:21,160 --> 01:32:24,430
And that they tried to get me to fight
when I was 16 or king of the cage.

3639
01:32:24,460 --> 01:32:25,600
He beat up Joe Camacho,

3640
01:32:25,601 --> 01:32:26,434
his first fight.

3641
01:32:26,950 --> 01:32:28,720
So crazy tough.

3642
01:32:28,721 --> 01:32:29,411
Joe Camacho.

3643
01:32:29,411 --> 01:32:30,244
Rustin please.

3644
01:32:30,330 --> 01:32:30,790
Yeah.

3645
01:32:30,790 --> 01:32:31,341
Couldn't believe that.

3646
01:32:31,341 --> 01:32:32,170
I'm a former teammate of mine.

3647
01:32:32,170 --> 01:32:33,040
He was a good dude.

3648
01:32:33,240 --> 01:32:37,570
He was alert Joe Chasy plenty
dude would fight anybody anytime.

3649
01:32:37,571 --> 01:32:38,190
Anywhere.

3650
01:32:38,190 --> 01:32:38,921
Good Dude too,

3651
01:32:38,921 --> 01:32:39,400
man.

3652
01:32:39,400 --> 01:32:40,630
That's another thing that's kind of gone.

3653
01:32:40,900 --> 01:32:41,531
Understandably.

3654
01:32:41,531 --> 01:32:41,951
I get it.

3655
01:32:41,951 --> 01:32:42,790
But yeah,

3656
01:32:43,010 --> 01:32:43,810
you know,

3657
01:32:43,810 --> 01:32:47,800
there was a few of those guys and a lot
of them have crap records cause they

3658
01:32:47,801 --> 01:32:49,330
would fight anywhere.

3659
01:32:49,870 --> 01:32:51,220
Chris Brennan give him a call,

3660
01:32:51,221 --> 01:32:51,731
he'll show up,

3661
01:32:51,731 --> 01:32:52,564
he'll fight.

3662
01:32:52,940 --> 01:32:53,180
Man,

3663
01:32:53,180 --> 01:32:53,650
Daddy,

3664
01:32:53,650 --> 01:32:54,490
give him a ring.

3665
01:32:55,210 --> 01:32:55,900
You know,

3666
01:32:55,900 --> 01:32:56,560
they'll show up,

3667
01:32:56,560 --> 01:32:57,430
they'll know those show up,

3668
01:32:57,431 --> 01:32:57,641
you know,

3669
01:32:57,641 --> 01:32:58,660
they'll fight and they'll have,

3670
01:32:58,661 --> 01:32:59,494
you know,

3671
01:32:59,560 --> 01:33:00,280
20 losses.

3672
01:33:00,280 --> 01:33:03,880
They don't give a shit that fucking
knock out of Weidman versus Silva.

3673
01:33:03,881 --> 01:33:04,960
That just showed him the replay.

3674
01:33:04,990 --> 01:33:05,823
I watch it.

3675
01:33:05,890 --> 01:33:06,910
I've seen it a hundred times.

3676
01:33:06,911 --> 01:33:07,930
I still don't believe it's happening.

3677
01:33:08,890 --> 01:33:09,371
I just go,

3678
01:33:09,371 --> 01:33:10,204
there's no way.

3679
01:33:10,210 --> 01:33:11,080
There's no way that's real.

3680
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:14,410
It's like you remember what buster Douglas
knocked out Mike Tyson and you watch

3681
01:33:14,411 --> 01:33:15,730
the replay like 10 times in a row.

3682
01:33:15,731 --> 01:33:16,001
You're like,

3683
01:33:16,001 --> 01:33:16,840
that didn't happen.

3684
01:33:16,860 --> 01:33:17,260
Yeah.

3685
01:33:17,260 --> 01:33:17,621
This is,

3686
01:33:17,621 --> 01:33:18,670
I'm watching a Hologram.

3687
01:33:18,690 --> 01:33:19,523
Yeah.

3688
01:33:19,900 --> 01:33:20,950
Upset in boxing history.

3689
01:33:20,951 --> 01:33:21,820
Crazy,

3690
01:33:22,240 --> 01:33:23,950
crazy upset in my opinion.

3691
01:33:24,010 --> 01:33:25,300
But when you watch it,

3692
01:33:26,380 --> 01:33:26,711
you know,

3693
01:33:26,711 --> 01:33:31,030
it doesn't seem real like I got when
I watch Hanan Barao Tj Dillashaw,

3694
01:33:31,031 --> 01:33:31,864
I've watched it again.

3695
01:33:31,930 --> 01:33:32,860
It seems real.

3696
01:33:32,980 --> 01:33:33,221
You know,

3697
01:33:33,221 --> 01:33:35,050
Tj put on a masterful performance,

3698
01:33:35,051 --> 01:33:35,950
but I believe it,

3699
01:33:36,160 --> 01:33:38,230
when I watched Weidman
connect with that left hook,

3700
01:33:38,231 --> 01:33:39,064
I'm like,

3701
01:33:39,070 --> 01:33:40,600
is this a parallel universe?

3702
01:33:40,601 --> 01:33:41,320
Is this something,

3703
01:33:41,320 --> 01:33:43,750
am I in a dream that really happened?

3704
01:33:43,780 --> 01:33:44,680
I cried and I was,

3705
01:33:44,710 --> 01:33:46,360
me and my brother cried when Tyson lost.

3706
01:33:46,620 --> 01:33:47,453
Did you,

3707
01:33:47,570 --> 01:33:48,403
why?

3708
01:33:48,670 --> 01:33:49,600
What happened to Daddy?

3709
01:33:50,530 --> 01:33:51,130
My Dad,

3710
01:33:51,130 --> 01:33:53,170
we watched and we steam
still watches every UFC,

3711
01:33:53,490 --> 01:33:54,250
every boxing.

3712
01:33:54,250 --> 01:33:55,600
He knows his shit and it's awesome.

3713
01:33:55,720 --> 01:33:56,291
And he just,

3714
01:33:56,291 --> 01:33:56,531
uh,

3715
01:33:56,531 --> 01:33:57,364
I remember,

3716
01:33:58,210 --> 01:33:59,043
oh my God,

3717
01:33:59,110 --> 01:34:00,160
Superman just died

3718
01:34:01,810 --> 01:34:03,990
when he was struggling to
put that mouthpiece backend.

3719
01:34:04,230 --> 01:34:06,790
Mother fucker was came to the end though.

3720
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:11,020
Still trying to put his mouthpiece but
an ad on a shield Scra scrunching around

3721
01:34:11,021 --> 01:34:11,710
the ground,

3722
01:34:11,710 --> 01:34:13,120
try and get that thing in his mouth.

3723
01:34:13,540 --> 01:34:15,550
Speaking of awful corners.

3724
01:34:15,790 --> 01:34:16,830
Aaron Snow,

3725
01:34:17,010 --> 01:34:19,690
they didn't bring an end swell water bag,

3726
01:34:20,140 --> 01:34:22,990
blubber glove full of
ice ice water shit ever.

3727
01:34:22,991 --> 01:34:23,341
No.

3728
01:34:23,341 --> 01:34:24,330
Oh my God.

3729
01:34:24,370 --> 01:34:26,410
They didn't have an
end swell and that was,

3730
01:34:26,411 --> 01:34:26,591
you know,

3731
01:34:26,591 --> 01:34:27,820
we were talking about cornering.

3732
01:34:28,780 --> 01:34:29,680
Go out and Mike,

3733
01:34:29,720 --> 01:34:30,070
you go,

3734
01:34:30,070 --> 01:34:30,520
all right,

3735
01:34:30,520 --> 01:34:30,851
Mike,

3736
01:34:30,851 --> 01:34:31,684
move your head.

3737
01:34:31,690 --> 01:34:32,291
You sitting here with you.

3738
01:34:32,291 --> 01:34:32,651
I mean there were,

3739
01:34:32,651 --> 01:34:36,240
there wasn't technical things that anybody
could have told him and they lived,

3740
01:34:36,241 --> 01:34:37,540
just had no idea what to do.

3741
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:40,870
That's a kid always beating everybody
else is a perfect example of a guy

3742
01:34:40,871 --> 01:34:44,800
learning from fantastic coaches and
then thinking he doesn't need any more

3743
01:34:44,801 --> 01:34:45,280
coaching.

3744
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:45,941
Kevin Rooney,

3745
01:34:45,941 --> 01:34:47,740
amazing coach Kevin Rooney was amazing.

3746
01:34:47,741 --> 01:34:51,490
And before that customer
pulled a gun on him

3747
01:34:53,230 --> 01:34:54,900
at tends to dampen the relationship.

3748
01:34:55,700 --> 01:34:57,590
You're not supposed to
fuck Teddy's nice Mike.

3749
01:34:57,620 --> 01:34:57,780
Yeah.

3750
01:34:57,780 --> 01:34:58,430
Generally

3751
01:34:58,430 --> 01:35:00,860
cornering his knees that you know,

3752
01:35:01,050 --> 01:35:02,210
you want to read a bad idea.

3753
01:35:02,540 --> 01:35:03,410
Fucking beast.

3754
01:35:03,470 --> 01:35:04,340
Fucking savage.

3755
01:35:04,770 --> 01:35:05,570
Jeez.

3756
01:35:05,570 --> 01:35:08,000
Can't believe leaving a little
girls around my Tyson either.

3757
01:35:08,001 --> 01:35:08,834
By the way,

3758
01:35:09,980 --> 01:35:11,300
speaking of scenes where you go,

3759
01:35:11,301 --> 01:35:12,290
did I just see that?

3760
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:15,560
You know the interview he
did before the Lennox fight,

3761
01:35:15,590 --> 01:35:17,990
when there's a woman reporter
and she says something goes,

3762
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:18,920
are you talking on a turn?

3763
01:35:19,430 --> 01:35:19,911
And she goes,

3764
01:35:19,911 --> 01:35:20,960
I thought we were all just talking.

3765
01:35:20,961 --> 01:35:21,430
It was,

3766
01:35:21,430 --> 01:35:22,910
cause I usually don't do
interviews with women list.

3767
01:35:22,911 --> 01:35:23,810
So fornicate with me.

3768
01:35:24,260 --> 01:35:24,700
It's,

3769
01:35:24,700 --> 01:35:29,360
you should stop talking now and
who's go did I did I just see that?

3770
01:35:29,361 --> 01:35:29,720
Hey,

3771
01:35:29,720 --> 01:35:31,090
he's cool.

3772
01:35:31,120 --> 01:35:31,670
Savage.

3773
01:35:31,670 --> 01:35:32,620
Oh fuck you.

3774
01:35:32,621 --> 01:35:33,430
Tell you left.

3775
01:35:33,430 --> 01:35:34,760
Fuck you until you love me.

3776
01:35:34,770 --> 01:35:35,603
Faggot.

3777
01:35:36,020 --> 01:35:36,450
Oh,

3778
01:35:36,450 --> 01:35:37,430
running crazy.

3779
01:35:37,431 --> 01:35:38,450
Scared of white bitch.

3780
01:35:39,170 --> 01:35:40,550
Oh my God.

3781
01:35:40,580 --> 01:35:42,560
Scared Mailman.

3782
01:35:42,930 --> 01:35:43,763
Ah,

3783
01:35:44,650 --> 01:35:47,270
use you for real man.

3784
01:35:47,330 --> 01:35:47,481
Well,

3785
01:35:47,481 --> 01:35:50,520
when you hear him now he talks
about how much coke he was doing it.

3786
01:35:50,810 --> 01:35:51,680
Seriously.

3787
01:35:52,310 --> 01:35:53,600
I'll eat his babies.

3788
01:35:53,990 --> 01:35:54,823
Remember that?

3789
01:35:56,030 --> 01:35:56,863
Prayed for me.

3790
01:35:57,610 --> 01:35:58,970
I want to eat his children.

3791
01:35:59,160 --> 01:35:59,993
I'm for riches.

3792
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:01,820
My defects is impregnable.

3793
01:36:01,850 --> 01:36:03,020
I'm Jack Dempsey.

3794
01:36:03,350 --> 01:36:04,183
Oh,

3795
01:36:04,190 --> 01:36:05,670
John Sentence for roses.

3796
01:36:05,880 --> 01:36:06,830
Have you a chip.

3797
01:36:06,831 --> 01:36:08,240
It never lived precocious.

3798
01:36:10,550 --> 01:36:10,821
Yeah,

3799
01:36:10,821 --> 01:36:11,500
that was,

3800
01:36:11,500 --> 01:36:12,440
those were the days,

3801
01:36:12,441 --> 01:36:12,741
man.

3802
01:36:12,741 --> 01:36:13,640
Those were the days.

3803
01:36:14,180 --> 01:36:17,060
What do they show in the Weidman
versus Liotta Machita fight.

3804
01:36:17,210 --> 01:36:18,140
What do you think about this?

3805
01:36:18,141 --> 01:36:19,710
Do you think that he's gonna be
able to get ahold of Mitchell?

3806
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:22,690
Machida is tough for anybody.

3807
01:36:22,870 --> 01:36:24,340
He's just his style,

3808
01:36:24,341 --> 01:36:25,570
his Kryptonite.

3809
01:36:25,850 --> 01:36:28,000
And I have a tremendous respect for,

3810
01:36:28,001 --> 01:36:28,834
for uh,

3811
01:36:29,170 --> 01:36:29,651
everybody.

3812
01:36:29,651 --> 01:36:30,281
He's five.

3813
01:36:30,281 --> 01:36:32,470
It's just you just can't
get a handle on Machida.

3814
01:36:32,500 --> 01:36:34,670
He's so hard to get a handle on,

3815
01:36:34,670 --> 01:36:35,140
on man.

3816
01:36:35,140 --> 01:36:35,921
Why am I not as bad?

3817
01:36:35,921 --> 01:36:37,450
Knees to man real bad.

3818
01:36:37,690 --> 01:36:40,450
And he's fought through it
because he's incredibly tough.

3819
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:42,790
But he had Regena keen
done on both of his knees.

3820
01:36:43,230 --> 01:36:43,720
Um,

3821
01:36:43,720 --> 01:36:45,640
and then after he had Regena keen done,

3822
01:36:45,670 --> 01:36:49,180
he felt great and then fucked him up again
and then had to get meniscus surgery.

3823
01:36:49,181 --> 01:36:52,540
So he got meniscus surgery on both
knees and it wasn't that long ago.

3824
01:36:52,660 --> 01:36:54,880
And that's what canceled his last fight.

3825
01:36:54,910 --> 01:36:56,230
That's what postpone the fight.

3826
01:36:56,680 --> 01:36:57,251
And then,

3827
01:36:57,251 --> 01:36:57,461
you know,

3828
01:36:57,461 --> 01:37:00,880
obviously he was supposed to fight
Vito or Vito had to pull out.

3829
01:37:01,150 --> 01:37:03,640
They still have a veto,

3830
01:37:04,060 --> 01:37:06,280
apparently still has to get licensed.

3831
01:37:06,281 --> 01:37:08,590
And tested and all that jazz,

3832
01:37:08,591 --> 01:37:12,520
but he's another one of those guys off
the testosterone replacement and you

3833
01:37:12,521 --> 01:37:12,671
know,

3834
01:37:12,671 --> 01:37:13,504
now what,

3835
01:37:13,810 --> 01:37:15,520
especially with this new ruling,

3836
01:37:15,521 --> 01:37:16,390
when they found out,

3837
01:37:16,420 --> 01:37:19,480
now that everybody knows that shale
signing got popped and now that everybody

3838
01:37:19,481 --> 01:37:20,890
knows that he got popped with this,

3839
01:37:20,920 --> 01:37:22,780
this new testing that they're doing,

3840
01:37:22,781 --> 01:37:24,550
it's $45,000 testing.

3841
01:37:24,550 --> 01:37:25,690
Who's scrambling right now?

3842
01:37:25,810 --> 01:37:27,990
That's what I'm wondering
about is who's right up on,

3843
01:37:28,030 --> 01:37:28,930
oh shit.

3844
01:37:28,990 --> 01:37:31,180
There's dudes are scrapped a lot
of motherfuckers that are like,

3845
01:37:31,240 --> 01:37:31,850
oh,

3846
01:37:31,850 --> 01:37:33,190
especially a lot of guys,

3847
01:37:33,250 --> 01:37:34,420
especially the older guys,

3848
01:37:34,780 --> 01:37:36,190
it's been anybody that was on it.

3849
01:37:36,490 --> 01:37:37,271
I mean anybody that,

3850
01:37:37,271 --> 01:37:38,104
I mean there was,

3851
01:37:38,350 --> 01:37:41,170
there was only a handful of guys
that were officially on testosterone

3852
01:37:41,171 --> 01:37:42,004
replacement,

3853
01:37:42,430 --> 01:37:43,570
but they're all fucked.

3854
01:37:44,380 --> 01:37:44,741
I mean,

3855
01:37:44,741 --> 01:37:46,850
Dan Henderson is the only one who's,

3856
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:51,640
who's been able to fight on it and
off it with very similar results.

3857
01:37:52,030 --> 01:37:53,620
Like he fought a Rashad Evans,

3858
01:37:53,621 --> 01:37:56,400
he was off of it because
Winnipeg have a sanctioning.

3859
01:37:56,550 --> 01:37:58,350
They didn't sanction
testosterone replacement.

3860
01:37:58,590 --> 01:38:00,750
So Dan apparently only
takes a little bit of it,

3861
01:38:00,930 --> 01:38:01,763
so he's like,

3862
01:38:01,770 --> 01:38:02,603
I just won't take it.

3863
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:05,400
So he just fought without
it and did didn't,

3864
01:38:05,401 --> 01:38:08,580
it wasn't like a sweeping
difference between how he looked.

3865
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:09,713
Yeah.

3866
01:38:10,870 --> 01:38:12,390
Dan's a guy by the way,

3867
01:38:12,391 --> 01:38:12,901
personally,

3868
01:38:12,901 --> 01:38:15,270
and he's training a little
bit and Dan's a great guy.

3869
01:38:15,300 --> 01:38:16,133
I really liked him.

3870
01:38:16,440 --> 01:38:17,280
I really don't want to see,

3871
01:38:17,340 --> 01:38:19,050
have that fight where he suddenly old.

3872
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:21,510
I just hope he gets out before
then cause he's looked okay.

3873
01:38:21,511 --> 01:38:23,900
I mean he's looked good.

3874
01:38:23,910 --> 01:38:24,540
It just,

3875
01:38:24,540 --> 01:38:25,920
I don't want him to have that fight.

3876
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:26,290
I just,

3877
01:38:26,290 --> 01:38:27,990
I just really don't want to see it as a,

3878
01:38:27,991 --> 01:38:28,440
as a,

3879
01:38:28,440 --> 01:38:29,273
as a fan.

3880
01:38:29,580 --> 01:38:30,750
I really don't want to see that fight,

3881
01:38:30,751 --> 01:38:30,930
man.

3882
01:38:30,930 --> 01:38:35,400
Well he's got a chin that's made out
of some new kind of metal and it's like

3883
01:38:35,401 --> 01:38:36,870
they don't even know what her in Shit.

3884
01:38:36,870 --> 01:38:37,231
Yeah.

3885
01:38:37,231 --> 01:38:38,310
It doesn't even make sense.

3886
01:38:38,311 --> 01:38:39,750
I never seen a guy take shots.

3887
01:38:39,751 --> 01:38:40,710
Like he takes shots.

3888
01:38:41,080 --> 01:38:43,440
He's got the best Chin
I've ever seen in my life.

3889
01:38:43,830 --> 01:38:44,071
I mean,

3890
01:38:44,071 --> 01:38:45,120
I've seen him get rocked.

3891
01:38:45,270 --> 01:38:46,320
Anderson rocked him.

3892
01:38:46,590 --> 01:38:50,220
Anderson lit them up with like a four
or five punch combination before he,

3893
01:38:50,221 --> 01:38:50,460
uh,

3894
01:38:50,460 --> 01:38:51,630
Kot him or for you.

3895
01:38:51,631 --> 01:38:52,261
I choked him out.

3896
01:38:52,261 --> 01:38:53,370
Rather he,

3897
01:38:53,371 --> 01:38:56,190
he's the first guy that I've
ever seen hurt Dan like that.

3898
01:38:56,191 --> 01:38:58,930
But Dan's been in some
crazy ass fucking wars.

3899
01:38:58,950 --> 01:39:02,250
Really tenderly and pride
the dog shit out of him.

3900
01:39:02,280 --> 01:39:04,020
And the first fight in the first fight,

3901
01:39:04,470 --> 01:39:05,670
the dog shit out of him,

3902
01:39:05,671 --> 01:39:09,200
beat the dog shit out of him going
and he fucked Vandelay up to his back.

3903
01:39:09,240 --> 01:39:12,270
That's what Vandelay was just if you just,

3904
01:39:12,360 --> 01:39:14,850
if you had a steroid test
and you brought it near him,

3905
01:39:14,851 --> 01:39:15,684
it would explode.

3906
01:39:16,280 --> 01:39:17,940
It would start shaking in your hands.

3907
01:39:18,040 --> 01:39:20,190
[inaudible]

3908
01:39:20,260 --> 01:39:21,900
a black hole would be created.

3909
01:39:21,930 --> 01:39:22,111
Yeah.

3910
01:39:22,111 --> 01:39:22,261
Like,

3911
01:39:22,261 --> 01:39:23,550
cause you're fucking screwed.

3912
01:39:23,551 --> 01:39:24,690
Like a memorex commercial.

3913
01:39:24,691 --> 01:39:25,820
When they yell,

3914
01:39:25,830 --> 01:39:27,560
they sing in the fucking glass break.

3915
01:39:29,970 --> 01:39:30,820
It would just,

3916
01:39:31,370 --> 01:39:32,910
it would just fucking explode.

3917
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:37,470
So he got rocked with a big punch and
Dan caught him with a huge right hand,

3918
01:39:37,471 --> 01:39:38,520
fucked his eye up.

3919
01:39:38,580 --> 01:39:40,500
Remember vandelays I was
completely caught up.

3920
01:39:41,280 --> 01:39:42,001
And by the way,

3921
01:39:42,001 --> 01:39:42,601
he was fighting.

3922
01:39:42,601 --> 01:39:44,490
It was like he needed even
notice it didn't even care.

3923
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:45,353
Didn't even care.

3924
01:39:45,380 --> 01:39:46,950
I don't think enough people,

3925
01:39:47,010 --> 01:39:47,491
and this is,

3926
01:39:47,491 --> 01:39:52,230
I really believe this cro cop beat
the career out of Vendelay Silva.

3927
01:39:52,290 --> 01:39:56,070
I believe he did shoot
him so badly in pride,

3928
01:39:56,071 --> 01:39:57,060
Grand Prix heavyweight.

3929
01:39:57,420 --> 01:39:59,690
I don't think Manderlay was
ever the same dude after that.

3930
01:40:00,470 --> 01:40:01,400
Beat the career out of them.

3931
01:40:01,401 --> 01:40:03,480
There's that was Vandelay
that one fight man.

3932
01:40:03,630 --> 01:40:06,990
Vandelay was trying to
fight a 214 pounds again,

3933
01:40:07,020 --> 01:40:08,100
juice to the Gig.

3934
01:40:08,100 --> 01:40:09,560
No Big Gig kills.

3935
01:40:10,720 --> 01:40:12,030
You wouldn't piss hot.

3936
01:40:12,031 --> 01:40:13,410
He would piss liquid steroid.

3937
01:40:13,411 --> 01:40:14,360
Like you can drink that.

3938
01:40:14,870 --> 01:40:16,740
He's gained 10 pounds.

3939
01:40:17,160 --> 01:40:17,881
Get home.

3940
01:40:17,881 --> 01:40:18,241
You'd be like,

3941
01:40:18,241 --> 01:40:19,150
why am I so food?

3942
01:40:19,260 --> 01:40:22,520
You can eat Vander lane dude.

3943
01:40:23,080 --> 01:40:24,540
But his wife was all jacked up.

3944
01:40:24,541 --> 01:40:25,374
She grew up,

3945
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:26,400
she grew a beard.

3946
01:40:26,850 --> 01:40:27,580
Yeah.

3947
01:40:27,580 --> 01:40:28,240
Delay was,

3948
01:40:28,240 --> 01:40:29,130
was a monster.

3949
01:40:29,160 --> 01:40:30,600
I mean he was just not afraid of anybody.

3950
01:40:30,601 --> 01:40:31,411
But that was when,

3951
01:40:31,411 --> 01:40:33,030
for those of you who hasn't see it,

3952
01:40:33,031 --> 01:40:33,301
dude,

3953
01:40:33,301 --> 01:40:33,820
it's,

3954
01:40:33,820 --> 01:40:34,470
it's uh,

3955
01:40:34,470 --> 01:40:36,510
an ass whooping from the beginning to end.

3956
01:40:36,600 --> 01:40:38,520
There's an ass scary person back then

3957
01:40:40,830 --> 01:40:43,410
and he fucked Vandelay
up before he killed him.

3958
01:40:43,411 --> 01:40:44,090
He had to do,

3959
01:40:44,090 --> 01:40:44,923
was it up?

3960
01:40:45,740 --> 01:40:46,590
He never been the same.

3961
01:40:46,591 --> 01:40:47,400
So good.

3962
01:40:47,400 --> 01:40:48,031
But then again,

3963
01:40:48,031 --> 01:40:49,500
he's another guy will do,

3964
01:40:49,501 --> 01:40:50,071
we're all,

3965
01:40:50,071 --> 01:40:50,904
look,

3966
01:40:51,090 --> 01:40:52,590
when you talked to ensign anyway,

3967
01:40:52,620 --> 01:40:55,690
he said had contracts that said
they don't test for steroids.

3968
01:40:55,860 --> 01:40:58,390
Like contracts are telling you they're
not going to test it with steroids.

3969
01:40:58,390 --> 01:40:58,770
Yeah.

3970
01:40:58,770 --> 01:41:00,280
You know the ends and laughs about it.

3971
01:41:00,330 --> 01:41:00,550
Yeah,

3972
01:41:00,550 --> 01:41:04,210
but you look at it didn't give a fuck
like cro cop and he comes over to the UFC

3973
01:41:04,211 --> 01:41:05,650
and he's just never the fucking same.

3974
01:41:06,180 --> 01:41:07,060
Not the same guy.

3975
01:41:07,330 --> 01:41:07,931
Everybody goes,

3976
01:41:07,931 --> 01:41:08,130
yeah,

3977
01:41:08,130 --> 01:41:09,310
private photos weren't that good.

3978
01:41:09,311 --> 01:41:11,770
The kiln you'll see him got
smoked and I'm like number one,

3979
01:41:11,771 --> 01:41:12,650
a couple of them one bell.

3980
01:41:12,651 --> 01:41:16,270
It's like going to throw on rampage
but gee you think I know they were just

3981
01:41:16,271 --> 01:41:19,150
juiced the gills to the gills man.

3982
01:41:19,210 --> 01:41:23,590
And we all know that you can only
have so many of those fucking fights.

3983
01:41:23,680 --> 01:41:24,930
The reason they were big in practice,

3984
01:41:24,940 --> 01:41:26,320
he had 20 of you know,

3985
01:41:26,680 --> 01:41:29,770
20 fights against top guys and
everybody now is like a pride fan.

3986
01:41:29,800 --> 01:41:31,240
Like it's like cool to be a pride fan.

3987
01:41:31,270 --> 01:41:31,540
Yeah.

3988
01:41:31,540 --> 01:41:36,540
They had some freak show fights
that made no sense that a lot of,

3989
01:41:37,270 --> 01:41:38,590
I love prime old school pride fan,

3990
01:41:38,591 --> 01:41:40,270
but a lot of those fights were like,

3991
01:41:40,870 --> 01:41:41,411
they would throw,

3992
01:41:41,411 --> 01:41:42,190
got member dies,

3993
01:41:42,190 --> 01:41:43,023
you're Matsui.

3994
01:41:43,240 --> 01:41:44,550
They would just throw him to this.

3995
01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:46,240
Anybody who was against anybody.

3996
01:41:46,241 --> 01:41:51,241
It's like you can't take that number of
beatings or just hard fights period and

3997
01:41:51,291 --> 01:41:52,390
and have a career after that.

3998
01:41:52,391 --> 01:41:53,830
Like it's just Sakuraba.

3999
01:41:54,590 --> 01:41:55,090
I mean that,

4000
01:41:55,090 --> 01:41:57,100
and they gave him no love dude.

4001
01:41:57,101 --> 01:41:58,090
Like after he was,

4002
01:41:58,510 --> 01:41:59,343
you know,

4003
01:41:59,730 --> 01:42:00,061
after,

4004
01:42:00,061 --> 01:42:01,890
basically after he lost
the valley's second time,

4005
01:42:01,891 --> 01:42:04,320
it was clear that he was going to
be mentally then it was cro cop.

4006
01:42:04,710 --> 01:42:05,101
It was just,

4007
01:42:05,101 --> 01:42:06,540
they never gave the guy a break,

4008
01:42:06,541 --> 01:42:06,840
man.

4009
01:42:06,840 --> 01:42:10,950
That the one time I saw him
was that Soboba King of the
cage and he was drinking

4010
01:42:10,951 --> 01:42:11,880
and smoking cigarettes.

4011
01:42:14,200 --> 01:42:14,400
Well,

4012
01:42:14,400 --> 01:42:15,750
apparently he always smoked.

4013
01:42:16,170 --> 01:42:17,360
Smoked when he was in training,

4014
01:42:17,361 --> 01:42:18,660
it gets supplements is what he said.

4015
01:42:19,080 --> 01:42:19,740
Oh really?

4016
01:42:19,740 --> 01:42:19,901
No,

4017
01:42:19,901 --> 01:42:20,010
no,

4018
01:42:20,010 --> 01:42:20,130
no.

4019
01:42:20,130 --> 01:42:20,400
He just,

4020
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:21,233
that's when you called them.

4021
01:42:23,280 --> 01:42:24,990
It's amazing how good his cardio was.

4022
01:42:25,020 --> 01:42:25,740
Yeah.

4023
01:42:25,740 --> 01:42:28,200
The guy never gassed out and never
smoke cigarettes all the time.

4024
01:42:28,380 --> 01:42:28,740
Yeah.

4025
01:42:28,740 --> 01:42:28,981
It's like,

4026
01:42:28,981 --> 01:42:30,200
what's his name from Nicaragua?

4027
01:42:30,201 --> 01:42:31,090
The boxer there.

4028
01:42:31,100 --> 01:42:31,933
The guy who

4029
01:42:33,390 --> 01:42:36,780
tried a little bit of a
MMA holds go chat and yeah,

4030
01:42:37,020 --> 01:42:38,490
it's just a smoke cigarettes.

4031
01:42:38,580 --> 01:42:39,810
Romi Romi from my gym.

4032
01:42:39,811 --> 01:42:39,920
It's,

4033
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:40,660
he just smokes,

4034
01:42:40,660 --> 01:42:42,300
eats gristle and drinks alcohol.

4035
01:42:42,360 --> 01:42:42,810
Really?

4036
01:42:42,810 --> 01:42:44,370
And he just like,

4037
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:45,210
he knew when he,

4038
01:42:45,210 --> 01:42:46,380
he never gets tired of punching.

4039
01:42:46,690 --> 01:42:47,461
He'd take it for a run.

4040
01:42:47,461 --> 01:42:48,720
You don't run them into the ground.

4041
01:42:48,721 --> 01:42:49,081
It's easy,

4042
01:42:49,081 --> 01:42:50,920
but giant punch with
them and blah blah blah,

4043
01:42:50,921 --> 01:42:51,061
blah,

4044
01:42:51,061 --> 01:42:51,211
blah,

4045
01:42:51,211 --> 01:42:51,361
blah,

4046
01:42:51,361 --> 01:42:51,511
blah,

4047
01:42:51,511 --> 01:42:51,661
blah,

4048
01:42:51,661 --> 01:42:51,781
blah,

4049
01:42:51,781 --> 01:42:51,901
blah,

4050
01:42:51,901 --> 01:42:52,051
blah,

4051
01:42:52,051 --> 01:42:52,290
blah.

4052
01:42:52,290 --> 01:42:52,561
I'm like,

4053
01:42:52,561 --> 01:42:52,860
dude,

4054
01:42:52,860 --> 01:42:56,520
we just went five fives and you're still
punching faster than when you smoke

4055
01:42:56,521 --> 01:42:57,000
cigarettes.

4056
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:58,140
You smoked cigarettes every day.

4057
01:42:58,570 --> 01:42:59,640
A lot of Thai guys do.

4058
01:42:59,641 --> 01:43:00,030
Right?

4059
01:43:00,030 --> 01:43:00,270
Yeah.

4060
01:43:00,270 --> 01:43:02,870
The ties a lot of the times
he tried cigarettes with,

4061
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:03,713
with the foreigners.

4062
01:43:04,710 --> 01:43:06,750
That's so hilarious to get
some foreign cigarettes.

4063
01:43:06,780 --> 01:43:07,613
Yeah.

4064
01:43:07,620 --> 01:43:11,550
So this is a Saiza for who won
the ultimate fighter Brazil.

4065
01:43:12,150 --> 01:43:12,900
Um,

4066
01:43:12,900 --> 01:43:14,300
he's coming off of that knockout.

4067
01:43:14,310 --> 01:43:15,100
Lost a CB.

4068
01:43:15,100 --> 01:43:15,541
Dalloway though,

4069
01:43:15,541 --> 01:43:15,781
right?

4070
01:43:15,781 --> 01:43:16,860
Wasn't that as last fight?

4071
01:43:18,030 --> 01:43:19,160
Dalloway caught him?

4072
01:43:19,161 --> 01:43:19,770
I don't think so.

4073
01:43:19,770 --> 01:43:21,300
Beautiful Punch it.

4074
01:43:21,301 --> 01:43:21,571
Start.

4075
01:43:21,571 --> 01:43:24,740
Dolly's standup is much improved and a,

4076
01:43:24,750 --> 01:43:25,830
this is an interesting fight,

4077
01:43:25,831 --> 01:43:26,664
man.

4078
01:43:28,460 --> 01:43:29,293
Andrew Craig,

4079
01:43:29,360 --> 01:43:33,110
who's another one of those guys that's
a an athlete in other sports that came

4080
01:43:33,111 --> 01:43:34,610
into MMA late in life.

4081
01:43:36,030 --> 01:43:36,450
Okay.

4082
01:43:36,450 --> 01:43:37,320
He played football.

4083
01:43:37,710 --> 01:43:38,460
Where did he do?

4084
01:43:38,460 --> 01:43:39,390
I don't remember.

4085
01:43:40,210 --> 01:43:40,590
Okay.

4086
01:43:40,590 --> 01:43:41,490
I don't remember what he did.

4087
01:43:41,520 --> 01:43:42,960
I wish I had my cheat
sheet in front of me.

4088
01:43:42,970 --> 01:43:43,340
Okay.

4089
01:43:43,340 --> 01:43:43,620
10.

4090
01:43:43,620 --> 01:43:44,370
I'm smart.

4091
01:43:44,370 --> 01:43:45,540
I fought with them in Brazil.

4092
01:43:46,380 --> 01:43:46,830
Did you?

4093
01:43:46,830 --> 01:43:47,460
Yeah.

4094
01:43:47,460 --> 01:43:49,050
Or not presenting that in Australia.

4095
01:43:49,110 --> 01:43:49,800
Shipping this guy.

4096
01:43:49,800 --> 01:43:50,550
I cut way together.

4097
01:43:50,550 --> 01:43:50,930
Yeah.

4098
01:43:50,930 --> 01:43:51,770
Very good dude.

4099
01:43:52,550 --> 01:43:53,241
Tough guy too,

4100
01:43:53,241 --> 01:43:53,481
man.

4101
01:43:53,481 --> 01:43:55,400
I loved how he looked against Chris Leben.

4102
01:43:55,580 --> 01:43:58,130
That was one of the signs
that it was over for Lieben.

4103
01:43:58,220 --> 01:43:59,053
Yeah,

4104
01:43:59,120 --> 01:44:04,120
because Andrew Craig avoided all Lievens
charges and fought with it for a him.

4105
01:44:05,920 --> 01:44:06,753
Them.

4106
01:44:07,440 --> 01:44:08,000
Okay

4107
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:09,050
for arrows trying to lock up.

4108
01:44:09,890 --> 01:44:11,180
Anaconda choked right away.

4109
01:44:13,860 --> 01:44:14,041
Oh,

4110
01:44:14,041 --> 01:44:14,990
look at his army and a teen.

4111
01:44:14,991 --> 01:44:16,530
He loves that arm and Guillotine to man.

4112
01:44:16,710 --> 01:44:18,930
He got that army Ganti and
in one of his last fights,

4113
01:44:19,260 --> 01:44:20,580
he hops over to the side,

4114
01:44:20,670 --> 01:44:23,490
gets his hips on the side and
traps the Arman with his hips.

4115
01:44:23,630 --> 01:44:25,110
We were just talking
about this last night.

4116
01:44:25,111 --> 01:44:25,680
Yeah.

4117
01:44:25,680 --> 01:44:26,191
With some MMA,

4118
01:44:26,191 --> 01:44:29,170
Jujitsu guys at the Ice
House about that gates.

4119
01:44:29,171 --> 01:44:30,570
You know a lot of guys are doing that now.

4120
01:44:31,050 --> 01:44:33,180
They trap that Armin and
jump off to the side.

4121
01:44:33,210 --> 01:44:34,710
You can circle and go Peruvian too.

4122
01:44:34,770 --> 01:44:36,630
[inaudible] yeah,

4123
01:44:37,050 --> 01:44:37,231
yeah.

4124
01:44:37,231 --> 01:44:38,640
I liked the Peruvian necktie.

4125
01:44:41,030 --> 01:44:41,863
Yeah.

4126
01:44:42,470 --> 01:44:44,750
Now he's saw switching
it up to that 10 finger.

4127
01:44:46,090 --> 01:44:46,460
Nope.

4128
01:44:46,460 --> 01:44:47,980
Angie's got those hand separated.

4129
01:44:48,160 --> 01:44:49,660
Let's see if Andrew goes to his back.

4130
01:44:50,080 --> 01:44:50,591
Cause that's the thing.

4131
01:44:50,591 --> 01:44:52,180
A lot of dudes don't
want to give up the back.

4132
01:44:52,210 --> 01:44:53,010
You know.

4133
01:44:53,010 --> 01:44:54,010
And Andrew stood back up.

4134
01:44:54,011 --> 01:44:55,150
Nicely done by Craig.

4135
01:44:57,930 --> 01:44:59,940
Andrew Craig's got to get
rid of that crazy beard.

4136
01:45:00,240 --> 01:45:00,601
Look at that.

4137
01:45:00,601 --> 01:45:01,350
It looks,

4138
01:45:01,350 --> 01:45:02,310
it looks very uncle creepy.

4139
01:45:02,311 --> 01:45:03,144
Like

4140
01:45:03,810 --> 01:45:05,270
there's one of us can
have that motherfucker.

4141
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:06,673
Don't get mad.

4142
01:45:07,540 --> 01:45:08,540
No tests.

4143
01:45:08,570 --> 01:45:10,370
Twirly up the tips of his mustache.

4144
01:45:10,371 --> 01:45:11,204
Then you going to have to talk,

4145
01:45:11,270 --> 01:45:11,871
talked with them.

4146
01:45:11,871 --> 01:45:12,171
Listen,

4147
01:45:12,171 --> 01:45:13,250
son Eddie Wineland

4148
01:45:13,620 --> 01:45:14,200
it does it.

4149
01:45:14,200 --> 01:45:14,680
Does he?

4150
01:45:14,680 --> 01:45:14,921
Yeah,

4151
01:45:14,921 --> 01:45:15,450
he's,

4152
01:45:15,450 --> 01:45:15,991
I'll get my head.

4153
01:45:15,991 --> 01:45:16,421
It does.

4154
01:45:16,421 --> 01:45:17,110
Yeah.

4155
01:45:17,110 --> 01:45:17,840
When does he do it?

4156
01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:19,060
And I never saw him do that.

4157
01:45:19,180 --> 01:45:19,381
Yeah.

4158
01:45:19,381 --> 01:45:20,201
I don't know if he still has it.

4159
01:45:20,201 --> 01:45:21,640
I know he's had it before in the past.

4160
01:45:22,540 --> 01:45:23,890
What'd you think about his last fight?

4161
01:45:24,840 --> 01:45:25,660
How do you find that?

4162
01:45:25,660 --> 01:45:26,051
He,

4163
01:45:26,051 --> 01:45:26,770
um,

4164
01:45:26,770 --> 01:45:27,603
I got knocked out.

4165
01:45:27,640 --> 01:45:28,060
Remember?

4166
01:45:28,060 --> 01:45:28,391
Oh,

4167
01:45:28,391 --> 01:45:30,190
by a Brazilian cat?

4168
01:45:30,610 --> 01:45:31,150
Yeah.

4169
01:45:31,150 --> 01:45:31,601
Young one,

4170
01:45:31,601 --> 01:45:32,380
isn't it?

4171
01:45:32,380 --> 01:45:32,561
Yeah.

4172
01:45:32,561 --> 01:45:33,394
I'll pull it up.

4173
01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:35,633
Okay.

4174
01:45:35,710 --> 01:45:36,960
He might retire,

4175
01:45:36,990 --> 01:45:38,760
which sucks because
he's got his job broken.

4176
01:45:38,761 --> 01:45:39,180
Yup.

4177
01:45:39,180 --> 01:45:39,740
Yeah.

4178
01:45:39,740 --> 01:45:41,010
I hate to get wired.

4179
01:45:41,410 --> 01:45:43,250
I love watch that guy fired.

4180
01:45:43,830 --> 01:45:44,490
He's exciting.

4181
01:45:44,490 --> 01:45:46,710
You want to talk about God never
keeps his fucking hands up.

4182
01:45:46,740 --> 01:45:47,400
Yeah.

4183
01:45:47,400 --> 01:45:48,031
You just sling.

4184
01:45:48,031 --> 01:45:49,750
So I mean he moved his head real good.

4185
01:45:49,751 --> 01:45:51,150
Good footwork Johnny.

4186
01:45:51,180 --> 01:45:52,290
Eduardo knocked him out.

4187
01:45:52,291 --> 01:45:52,980
Yeah.

4188
01:45:52,980 --> 01:45:53,101
Oh,

4189
01:45:53,101 --> 01:45:53,701
he's cut bad.

4190
01:45:53,701 --> 01:45:54,534
Look at that.

4191
01:45:56,110 --> 01:45:57,460
His blood running down
the side of his face.

4192
01:45:57,490 --> 01:45:57,751
Yeah.

4193
01:45:57,751 --> 01:45:58,541
It's a good spot though.

4194
01:45:58,541 --> 01:46:00,630
At the top has had corn rows,

4195
01:46:00,640 --> 01:46:04,660
like a fucking white check hanging
out with black dudes or in Cabo.

4196
01:46:05,830 --> 01:46:06,560
Cabo.

4197
01:46:06,560 --> 01:46:07,100
Yeah.

4198
01:46:07,100 --> 01:46:08,650
Bo Derek Fan low.

4199
01:46:08,651 --> 01:46:09,261
Derek.

4200
01:46:09,261 --> 01:46:09,550
Man,

4201
01:46:09,550 --> 01:46:10,291
it's an old school.

4202
01:46:10,291 --> 01:46:11,021
And what's going on?

4203
01:46:11,021 --> 01:46:11,890
I got poked too.

4204
01:46:11,950 --> 01:46:12,730
God Damn.

4205
01:46:12,730 --> 01:46:13,840
I hate these high pokes.

4206
01:46:14,160 --> 01:46:14,651
Now here's the thing.

4207
01:46:14,651 --> 01:46:16,330
It's something that
Abella Tor is doing good.

4208
01:46:16,360 --> 01:46:19,090
I like that new glove that you
guys have other than Jimmy Smith.

4209
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:19,850
Yeah.

4210
01:46:19,850 --> 01:46:19,941
Oh,

4211
01:46:19,941 --> 01:46:21,470
that's the main thing.

4212
01:46:21,471 --> 01:46:22,304
That's the main thing.

4213
01:46:22,740 --> 01:46:23,573
Good.

4214
01:46:24,050 --> 01:46:25,100
That Jimmy Smith Guy,

4215
01:46:25,130 --> 01:46:27,770
that guy works with questionable

4216
01:46:30,250 --> 01:46:31,011
at the gloves,

4217
01:46:31,011 --> 01:46:33,240
those new Everlast gloves that are are,

4218
01:46:33,250 --> 01:46:36,050
they protect the hand bore
and they're more curved.

4219
01:46:36,070 --> 01:46:36,831
The other kind of bent.

4220
01:46:36,831 --> 01:46:37,461
If you haven't seen them,

4221
01:46:37,461 --> 01:46:39,440
they're kind of like make a
hand couple of them I would.

4222
01:46:39,441 --> 01:46:39,711
Sure.

4223
01:46:39,711 --> 01:46:40,730
Like some more hand protection.

4224
01:46:40,770 --> 01:46:41,511
Yeah.

4225
01:46:41,511 --> 01:46:41,770
And

4226
01:46:41,770 --> 01:46:42,603
I know you use,

4227
01:46:42,650 --> 01:46:44,500
Dean's got a fucked up hand right now.

4228
01:46:47,080 --> 01:46:48,850
How many times he had hand surgery twice.

4229
01:46:49,750 --> 01:46:50,160
Brett's

4230
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:51,480
a two surgeries.

4231
01:46:51,481 --> 01:46:52,314
Two breaks.

4232
01:46:53,590 --> 01:46:54,180
Uh,

4233
01:46:54,180 --> 01:46:54,870
and it's just,

4234
01:46:54,870 --> 01:46:56,100
I mean it will break again.

4235
01:46:56,550 --> 01:46:58,740
It's just one of those
things you say too hard son.

4236
01:46:59,080 --> 01:46:59,913
Got a problem.

4237
01:47:01,720 --> 01:47:01,981
Right?

4238
01:47:01,981 --> 01:47:02,814
People in the top of that,

4239
01:47:03,010 --> 01:47:04,620
that's a problem as the killer.

4240
01:47:04,890 --> 01:47:07,860
This a good straight lamp by for that.

4241
01:47:07,861 --> 01:47:08,340
Um,

4242
01:47:08,340 --> 01:47:09,570
the Everlast glove,

4243
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:12,420
they've had very few
handbrakes in Beltour since,

4244
01:47:12,630 --> 01:47:13,800
since that was implemented.

4245
01:47:13,801 --> 01:47:14,220
Right.

4246
01:47:14,220 --> 01:47:15,180
What was the statistic?

4247
01:47:15,181 --> 01:47:15,840
Jimmy,

4248
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:16,830
you're the guy over there.

4249
01:47:17,010 --> 01:47:17,940
I am the guy over there.

4250
01:47:17,970 --> 01:47:18,661
What are the numbers,

4251
01:47:18,661 --> 01:47:19,494
Jimmy,

4252
01:47:19,880 --> 01:47:20,740
for the amperage?

4253
01:47:22,070 --> 01:47:22,441
Six.

4254
01:47:22,441 --> 01:47:23,240
About what?

4255
01:47:23,240 --> 01:47:23,550
Yeah,

4256
01:47:23,550 --> 01:47:24,510
what's your specific question?

4257
01:47:24,860 --> 01:47:25,201
Well,

4258
01:47:25,201 --> 01:47:26,220
there was a bunch of them.

4259
01:47:26,221 --> 01:47:27,150
There was a statistic.

4260
01:47:27,151 --> 01:47:29,280
Look how small retort
Belfort's aren't looks.

4261
01:47:29,281 --> 01:47:29,500
I mean,

4262
01:47:29,500 --> 01:47:30,630
I don't want to be the guy saying that,

4263
01:47:32,370 --> 01:47:33,960
just throwing that out there that

4264
01:47:36,300 --> 01:47:37,200
get rid of that guys,

4265
01:47:37,770 --> 01:47:38,640
they're heard us in the truck.

4266
01:47:39,190 --> 01:47:40,023
Um,

4267
01:47:40,050 --> 01:47:43,830
I know that there was like a
ton of handbrakes one season,

4268
01:47:44,250 --> 01:47:46,740
the season before the
implementation of these gloves.

4269
01:47:46,740 --> 01:47:48,450
And since then I don't
think there's been a break.

4270
01:47:48,540 --> 01:47:49,410
I haven't seen one.

4271
01:47:50,070 --> 01:47:50,491
I think,

4272
01:47:50,491 --> 01:47:50,791
yeah,

4273
01:47:50,791 --> 01:47:53,430
I think they've like literally
eliminated handbrakes which is,

4274
01:47:53,730 --> 01:47:55,590
I mean it's kind of anecdotal.

4275
01:47:55,591 --> 01:47:56,460
It's not like a,

4276
01:47:56,530 --> 01:47:57,330
well the problem,

4277
01:47:57,330 --> 01:47:58,660
the problem they've hadn't belter and,

4278
01:47:58,680 --> 01:48:00,790
and obviously it's,

4279
01:48:00,791 --> 01:48:02,430
it's going to change next year as well.

4280
01:48:02,431 --> 01:48:04,740
The tournament system guy would get
his hand broken and that was it.

4281
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:06,470
We had thrown somebody out like an injury.

4282
01:48:06,471 --> 01:48:06,811
We would go,

4283
01:48:06,811 --> 01:48:07,081
okay,

4284
01:48:07,081 --> 01:48:09,000
well he won't fight
for four months anyway.

4285
01:48:09,360 --> 01:48:10,470
Now he's got to find a month.

4286
01:48:10,510 --> 01:48:10,830
Yeah.

4287
01:48:10,830 --> 01:48:13,170
So that's why they don't
allow elbows on the ground.

4288
01:48:13,171 --> 01:48:14,004
It's because,

4289
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:15,270
or the LLS period,

4290
01:48:15,271 --> 01:48:17,460
it's because they didn't want cuts
where you get a 60 day suspension,

4291
01:48:17,490 --> 01:48:18,660
you can't fight the next month.

4292
01:48:19,080 --> 01:48:21,220
So that would really fuck belts were up.

4293
01:48:21,221 --> 01:48:22,140
So when people got injured,

4294
01:48:22,610 --> 01:48:23,401
fight in a month,

4295
01:48:23,401 --> 01:48:23,981
you've got a broken hand,

4296
01:48:23,981 --> 01:48:24,271
you don,

4297
01:48:24,271 --> 01:48:24,840
I mean it's just,

4298
01:48:24,840 --> 01:48:25,673
you gotta replace them.

4299
01:48:25,980 --> 01:48:29,010
Do you think that they're going
to change that fight in a month?

4300
01:48:29,011 --> 01:48:30,090
Thing with coke involved?

4301
01:48:30,150 --> 01:48:32,310
Cause I think that they're
getting rid of the tournament,

4302
01:48:32,340 --> 01:48:32,850
yes.

4303
01:48:32,850 --> 01:48:33,240
Thing.

4304
01:48:33,240 --> 01:48:33,720
Yes.

4305
01:48:33,720 --> 01:48:34,650
They uh,

4306
01:48:34,980 --> 01:48:39,830
the seasonal format where we're doing a
fight a week for three months is going

4307
01:48:39,831 --> 01:48:40,500
to go,

4308
01:48:40,500 --> 01:48:41,333
um,

4309
01:48:41,490 --> 01:48:45,780
that's what they're talking about
because essentially a one time until the

4310
01:48:45,781 --> 01:48:46,201
story,

4311
01:48:46,201 --> 01:48:49,590
a Marinello used to call me every week
to do when he was on the score and radio

4312
01:48:49,591 --> 01:48:52,830
show or whatever and to kind of break
down next week's bell torn one time.

4313
01:48:52,831 --> 01:48:53,664
He goes,

4314
01:48:54,050 --> 01:48:54,481
all right,

4315
01:48:54,481 --> 01:48:55,231
well in three weeks.

4316
01:48:55,231 --> 01:48:56,040
And I went,

4317
01:48:56,040 --> 01:48:56,671
Oh shit,

4318
01:48:56,671 --> 01:48:56,971
I'm not,

4319
01:48:56,971 --> 01:48:58,350
I don't know what's
happening in three weeks.

4320
01:48:58,380 --> 01:49:00,970
Like that's like a year to me,

4321
01:49:00,971 --> 01:49:01,230
you know,

4322
01:49:01,230 --> 01:49:02,610
that's like four or five years from now.

4323
01:49:02,611 --> 01:49:06,090
So I like running my computer and like
pull it up real quick so I can talk about

4324
01:49:06,091 --> 01:49:06,630
it.

4325
01:49:06,630 --> 01:49:09,150
I don't know what's happening
in two weeks or three weeks.

4326
01:49:09,180 --> 01:49:09,820
How has,

4327
01:49:09,820 --> 01:49:11,040
how have the fans get to
know what's happening?

4328
01:49:11,070 --> 01:49:14,010
We like you couldn't build up a fight
because we had a fight every week.

4329
01:49:14,190 --> 01:49:15,360
So unless you were like in it,

4330
01:49:15,810 --> 01:49:17,040
cause you like watching fights every week.

4331
01:49:17,041 --> 01:49:17,880
We did have those fans that,

4332
01:49:17,881 --> 01:49:18,780
that got into it.

4333
01:49:18,781 --> 01:49:19,430
Like you get into a,

4334
01:49:19,430 --> 01:49:20,790
to these TV series.

4335
01:49:21,420 --> 01:49:24,210
It was hard to hype a fight
and make a fight really big.

4336
01:49:24,211 --> 01:49:24,991
And Scott Coker,

4337
01:49:24,991 --> 01:49:29,160
his whole thing now is big fights
and you need lead time and you need

4338
01:49:29,161 --> 01:49:30,750
promotional time to build those up.

4339
01:49:30,780 --> 01:49:31,050
Yeah.

4340
01:49:31,050 --> 01:49:32,190
It can't be done every week.

4341
01:49:32,191 --> 01:49:33,024
So by the way,

4342
01:49:33,150 --> 01:49:34,920
nobody gives a fuck about tournaments.

4343
01:49:34,921 --> 01:49:35,754
They like,

4344
01:49:36,040 --> 01:49:36,873
they're like,

4345
01:49:36,990 --> 01:49:37,500
here's the,

4346
01:49:37,500 --> 01:49:38,760
here's the statistics.

4347
01:49:38,761 --> 01:49:39,151
And so,

4348
01:49:39,151 --> 01:49:39,780
you know,

4349
01:49:39,780 --> 01:49:44,780
the new gloves debuted at Beltour one
10 and Bella Torah has held nine events

4350
01:49:45,391 --> 01:49:47,620
and experiences zero handbrakes

4351
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:48,761
since uh,

4352
01:49:48,761 --> 01:49:50,470
the implementation of the new drug.

4353
01:49:50,620 --> 01:49:52,480
New gloves by comparison,

4354
01:49:52,650 --> 01:49:55,030
Bella tour season eight saw 11 events.

4355
01:49:55,031 --> 01:49:59,560
You'd the old use the old glove design
and included eight broken hands,

4356
01:50:00,340 --> 01:50:02,050
including welterweight champion,

4357
01:50:02,051 --> 01:50:02,890
Douglas Lema,

4358
01:50:03,060 --> 01:50:03,940
a beast,

4359
01:50:04,270 --> 01:50:07,690
a dude's a monster and
a lightweight standouts.

4360
01:50:07,700 --> 01:50:09,320
Assad a wad is that I say this,

4361
01:50:09,330 --> 01:50:14,330
I had a one side a wad and broke it
against Dave Rickles and Alexander

4362
01:50:14,740 --> 01:50:14,950
Karnofsky.

4363
01:50:14,950 --> 01:50:15,490
Yeah.

4364
01:50:15,490 --> 01:50:16,360
All broke their hand.

4365
01:50:16,720 --> 01:50:17,440
Yeah.

4366
01:50:17,440 --> 01:50:18,610
Imagine amazing man.

4367
01:50:19,030 --> 01:50:19,863
Amazing.

4368
01:50:20,050 --> 01:50:20,883
I remember those fights.

4369
01:50:22,120 --> 01:50:27,120
Season nine also featured 11 events
and had seven fighters suffer breaks.

4370
01:50:31,850 --> 01:50:32,683
Hold on a second.

4371
01:50:33,780 --> 01:50:34,613
Season Eight.

4372
01:50:34,630 --> 01:50:34,901
Okay.

4373
01:50:34,901 --> 01:50:35,620
This is,

4374
01:50:35,620 --> 01:50:36,131
this is thing.

4375
01:50:36,131 --> 01:50:40,630
Season eight had the new gloves and Oh,

4376
01:50:40,631 --> 01:50:42,100
they had eight broken hands.

4377
01:50:42,760 --> 01:50:42,941
Okay.

4378
01:50:42,941 --> 01:50:43,774
Hold on a second.

4379
01:50:45,130 --> 01:50:45,611
Wait a second.

4380
01:50:45,611 --> 01:50:46,630
Since the new glove,

4381
01:50:46,660 --> 01:50:48,100
they've held nine events.

4382
01:50:49,150 --> 01:50:49,580
Okay.

4383
01:50:49,580 --> 01:50:53,890
Bellator season eight saw 11
events with the old gloves to,

4384
01:50:53,891 --> 01:50:56,530
to deny your understanding that
the confusion of the season format.

4385
01:50:56,531 --> 01:50:57,191
Now right here,

4386
01:50:57,191 --> 01:50:57,431
Joe,

4387
01:50:57,431 --> 01:50:59,900
is just simplifying that.

4388
01:51:01,480 --> 01:51:01,920
Okay.

4389
01:51:01,920 --> 01:51:05,010
Well apparently they haven't had
Henny handbrakes since the new gloves.

4390
01:51:05,040 --> 01:51:05,810
I didn't know that.

4391
01:51:05,810 --> 01:51:06,481
We haven't any sense.

4392
01:51:06,481 --> 01:51:07,140
They had the new one.

4393
01:51:07,140 --> 01:51:07,980
That's incredible.

4394
01:51:08,130 --> 01:51:08,780
That's pretty cool.

4395
01:51:08,780 --> 01:51:09,630
That's pretty amazing.

4396
01:51:10,410 --> 01:51:12,210
So if you see the gloves,

4397
01:51:12,270 --> 01:51:12,781
you see them,

4398
01:51:12,781 --> 01:51:13,140
uh,

4399
01:51:13,140 --> 01:51:13,973
in an image,

4400
01:51:13,980 --> 01:51:14,813
you can see him here.

4401
01:51:15,120 --> 01:51:17,490
The comparison between the
old gloves and the new gloves,

4402
01:51:17,520 --> 01:51:18,353
they're just thicker,

4403
01:51:18,480 --> 01:51:19,313
thicker on top.

4404
01:51:19,410 --> 01:51:20,220
And not an Eli,

4405
01:51:20,220 --> 01:51:20,941
not any heavier.

4406
01:51:20,941 --> 01:51:21,200
Right.

4407
01:51:21,200 --> 01:51:22,110
It's still four ounce gloves.

4408
01:51:22,170 --> 01:51:23,003
Listen.

4409
01:51:23,150 --> 01:51:23,431
All right,

4410
01:51:23,431 --> 01:51:24,241
so Andrew,

4411
01:51:24,241 --> 01:51:24,631
Craig,

4412
01:51:24,631 --> 01:51:29,550
Cesar for [inaudible] finding the second
round here and Bhutanese fucking huge

4413
01:51:29,551 --> 01:51:30,540
for 185

4414
01:51:32,210 --> 01:51:32,421
yeah,

4415
01:51:32,421 --> 01:51:33,320
lean was one of those guys.

4416
01:51:33,321 --> 01:51:33,670
You look at him,

4417
01:51:33,670 --> 01:51:33,831
you go,

4418
01:51:33,831 --> 01:51:35,840
how the fuck do you make 170 pounds?

4419
01:51:36,200 --> 01:51:37,250
He is a giant.

4420
01:51:37,290 --> 01:51:40,410
Was that guy walk around at two 20 Jesus.

4421
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:42,913
Seriously,

4422
01:51:43,040 --> 01:51:43,701
north of two.

4423
01:51:43,701 --> 01:51:43,941
Well,

4424
01:51:43,941 --> 01:51:48,140
north of 200 it's well north of a perfect
example of a guy who diminished by

4425
01:51:48,141 --> 01:51:48,974
losing weight.

4426
01:51:49,100 --> 01:51:50,180
Is is uh,

4427
01:51:50,181 --> 01:51:51,140
Anthony Rumble Johnson.

4428
01:51:51,141 --> 01:51:52,310
He's the best example.

4429
01:51:52,330 --> 01:51:52,700
Yeah,

4430
01:51:52,700 --> 01:51:55,700
look at what the fuck that guy
looks like as a light heavyweight.

4431
01:51:55,880 --> 01:51:58,700
He's gotta be kicking himself for not
being a light heavyweight all along.

4432
01:51:58,730 --> 01:52:02,420
He's a scary having full
energy and full what he did.

4433
01:52:02,421 --> 01:52:03,200
Phil Davis,

4434
01:52:03,200 --> 01:52:04,340
nobody's done the Phil Davis.

4435
01:52:04,400 --> 01:52:05,480
He manhandled him,

4436
01:52:05,660 --> 01:52:06,493
handled them,

4437
01:52:06,680 --> 01:52:08,120
stuffed every takedown.

4438
01:52:08,150 --> 01:52:09,170
Like it was a joke.

4439
01:52:09,171 --> 01:52:10,790
Beat the shit out of him standing,

4440
01:52:11,010 --> 01:52:12,600
made it look like he didn't
belong in there with them.

4441
01:52:12,601 --> 01:52:13,490
It was amazing.

4442
01:52:13,540 --> 01:52:14,373
I can

4443
01:52:15,680 --> 01:52:18,740
power wise what were shot beat Phil Davis,

4444
01:52:18,950 --> 01:52:21,500
but physically didn't do it like that.

4445
01:52:21,501 --> 01:52:22,041
The floor with them.

4446
01:52:22,041 --> 01:52:22,940
Didn't do it like that.

4447
01:52:22,970 --> 01:52:25,040
Anthony Rumble Johnson
is fucking frightening.

4448
01:52:25,580 --> 01:52:26,000
Yeah.

4449
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:26,833
It's a scary dude.

4450
01:52:27,050 --> 01:52:31,730
So Andrew Craig and [inaudible]
here in the second round.

4451
01:52:37,230 --> 01:52:37,741
So yeah,

4452
01:52:37,741 --> 01:52:38,760
Ferrara did a,

4453
01:52:38,761 --> 01:52:39,900
he lost his last fight.

4454
01:52:41,320 --> 01:52:42,260
That was a,

4455
01:52:42,380 --> 01:52:43,090
the doll with Hud.

4456
01:52:43,090 --> 01:52:43,331
Yeah.

4457
01:52:43,331 --> 01:52:44,350
That was the doorway fight,

4458
01:52:49,100 --> 01:52:50,960
which was a great fight for,

4459
01:52:50,961 --> 01:52:51,740
uh,

4460
01:52:51,740 --> 01:52:52,573
for Dalloway.

4461
01:52:52,610 --> 01:52:55,190
Dollo is another one of those guys
that are really is coming into his own

4462
01:52:55,191 --> 01:52:55,990
lately.

4463
01:52:55,990 --> 01:52:56,960
He just starting to see it.

4464
01:53:01,230 --> 01:53:05,590
Dalloway is just starting to get real
comfortable with his hands were loose with

4465
01:53:05,591 --> 01:53:06,424
his hands

4466
01:53:09,220 --> 01:53:10,510
spinning back fist.

4467
01:53:12,990 --> 01:53:14,760
It's interesting how you're seeing,

4468
01:53:15,540 --> 01:53:15,960
like,

4469
01:53:15,960 --> 01:53:18,240
like we were talking
about this the other day,

4470
01:53:18,241 --> 01:53:20,100
that MMA has a lot of,

4471
01:53:20,101 --> 01:53:20,311
like,

4472
01:53:20,311 --> 01:53:22,890
one guy will do one thing
and you'll see it happen.

4473
01:53:23,940 --> 01:53:24,870
You'll see it'd be effective,

4474
01:53:24,871 --> 01:53:25,561
like a wheel kick.

4475
01:53:25,561 --> 01:53:26,980
And then you'll see like
everybody throwing wheels.

4476
01:53:27,010 --> 01:53:27,843
Everybody's trying it.

4477
01:53:27,960 --> 01:53:28,590
Yeah.

4478
01:53:28,590 --> 01:53:29,460
It's one of those things,

4479
01:53:29,490 --> 01:53:31,650
we'll get this holy
Shantay strong as fuck.

4480
01:53:32,040 --> 01:53:33,840
Good takedown defense by Craig though.

4481
01:53:34,830 --> 01:53:36,360
Andrew Craig's a really good athlete,

4482
01:53:36,361 --> 01:53:37,194
man.

4483
01:53:38,120 --> 01:53:40,700
And the reason why he's gotten
so good at MMA so quickly,

4484
01:53:48,650 --> 01:53:48,990
it's,

4485
01:53:48,990 --> 01:53:49,571
it's not the,

4486
01:53:49,571 --> 01:53:49,990
uh,

4487
01:53:49,990 --> 01:53:53,110
technique anymore is the x factor
is how good of an athlete are there.

4488
01:53:53,550 --> 01:53:54,850
That's definitely a part of it,

4489
01:53:54,851 --> 01:53:55,151
right?

4490
01:53:55,151 --> 01:53:55,331
I mean,

4491
01:53:55,331 --> 01:53:57,990
Marcello Garcia has always
said that about no Jujitsu,

4492
01:53:58,360 --> 01:54:02,050
that the difference she know g and g
is that physical attributes are so much

4493
01:54:02,051 --> 01:54:03,100
more important and no gay.

4494
01:54:03,400 --> 01:54:04,900
That a guy who was
really physically strong,

4495
01:54:04,901 --> 01:54:06,310
it counts for so much more.

4496
01:54:06,740 --> 01:54:08,610
Whereas the guys
physically strong and a g,

4497
01:54:09,010 --> 01:54:09,600
you know,

4498
01:54:09,600 --> 01:54:09,810
we,

4499
01:54:09,810 --> 01:54:10,030
we've,

4500
01:54:10,030 --> 01:54:12,820
we've all seen it guys get
wrapped up in spider webbed,

4501
01:54:13,210 --> 01:54:13,421
you know,

4502
01:54:13,421 --> 01:54:14,950
they just get gummed up.

4503
01:54:15,130 --> 01:54:16,570
Ted Today took second in the world.

4504
01:54:16,571 --> 01:54:18,100
That heavyweight did.

4505
01:54:18,101 --> 01:54:19,930
He really had heavyweight lost too.

4506
01:54:20,170 --> 01:54:22,510
Fibery silver dome on points.

4507
01:54:22,540 --> 01:54:23,320
That's incredible.

4508
01:54:23,320 --> 01:54:25,630
Heavyweight and heavyweight
[inaudible] obviously.

4509
01:54:25,660 --> 01:54:26,050
Yeah,

4510
01:54:26,050 --> 01:54:27,520
I mean that's how good ted today was.

4511
01:54:27,521 --> 01:54:29,680
I mean this guy fought for
the non Jujitsu people,

4512
01:54:29,681 --> 01:54:31,300
fought around 170 pounds.

4513
01:54:31,450 --> 01:54:32,170
Schooled Marcel,

4514
01:54:32,170 --> 01:54:32,921
see you in the world,

4515
01:54:32,921 --> 01:54:34,180
I think 2003 2004

4516
01:54:36,490 --> 01:54:37,090
with a geek.

4517
01:54:37,090 --> 01:54:38,770
So that's a perfect example is the guy,

4518
01:54:38,771 --> 01:54:38,891
you know,

4519
01:54:38,891 --> 01:54:41,530
I've seen Jeff Glover school
heavyweights with a g,

4520
01:54:42,010 --> 01:54:42,530
you know,

4521
01:54:42,530 --> 01:54:45,130
but anything Mary g off man.

4522
01:54:45,370 --> 01:54:45,940
Yeah.

4523
01:54:45,940 --> 01:54:47,500
That's why a lot of guys like Charlie,

4524
01:54:47,510 --> 01:54:48,370
you own the Geeky make,

4525
01:54:48,371 --> 01:54:50,140
you'll technical my friend.

4526
01:54:50,141 --> 01:54:53,560
You know you're going to train for MMA
but you'll learn train negi why they want

4527
01:54:53,561 --> 01:54:53,881
to do that.

4528
01:54:53,881 --> 01:54:56,860
Cause when they roll with you they get
still wrap you up in Brazilian Jujitsu.

4529
01:54:56,920 --> 01:54:59,080
You're Brazilian accent is
is incredible by the way.

4530
01:54:59,081 --> 01:54:59,650
It's not bad.

4531
01:54:59,650 --> 01:55:00,790
My friend Nova is normal.

4532
01:55:00,880 --> 01:55:01,810
I've been around,

4533
01:55:01,811 --> 01:55:02,440
you know,

4534
01:55:02,440 --> 01:55:04,000
do this guy with these guys.

4535
01:55:04,001 --> 01:55:04,301
You know,

4536
01:55:04,301 --> 01:55:06,130
Jujitsu is very good.

4537
01:55:06,280 --> 01:55:07,113
Very true.

4538
01:55:07,640 --> 01:55:08,690
Stays Ferrara.

4539
01:55:10,860 --> 01:55:14,310
We'll we'll kick that was like
the company talks about it,

4540
01:55:14,820 --> 01:55:17,010
dropped down and put his hands
on the ground and everything.

4541
01:55:20,310 --> 01:55:23,280
Andrew Craig looks a very v for vendetta.

4542
01:55:23,640 --> 01:55:24,473
He does.

4543
01:55:26,100 --> 01:55:27,540
He's doing the wrong thing though,

4544
01:55:27,541 --> 01:55:29,490
is when for us throwing
the wild techniques,

4545
01:55:29,491 --> 01:55:30,324
he's freezing.

4546
01:55:30,450 --> 01:55:31,880
Craig's kind of looking at it right now.

4547
01:55:31,950 --> 01:55:33,300
That's the time to get on the guy,

4548
01:55:33,750 --> 01:55:34,081
you know,

4549
01:55:34,081 --> 01:55:35,250
but straight shots,

4550
01:55:35,580 --> 01:55:38,700
straight shots and right now he's seeing
the funky techniques and freezing.

4551
01:55:39,190 --> 01:55:39,410
Yeah.

4552
01:55:39,410 --> 01:55:40,243
Looking at it.

4553
01:55:40,260 --> 01:55:41,420
He's still got a lot of,

4554
01:55:41,550 --> 01:55:43,500
a lot of growing to do know.

4555
01:55:44,880 --> 01:55:45,231
I mean the,

4556
01:55:45,231 --> 01:55:49,560
it's hard for a guy who's getting into
MMA late in life with no expertise in

4557
01:55:49,561 --> 01:55:50,190
anything.

4558
01:55:50,190 --> 01:55:50,690
It's one,

4559
01:55:50,690 --> 01:55:52,380
one thing if you're like a cro cop guy,

4560
01:55:52,381 --> 01:55:55,320
there was a high level kickboxer
enters into MMA and then you,

4561
01:55:55,321 --> 01:55:55,540
you,

4562
01:55:55,540 --> 01:55:56,640
we get to watch the,

4563
01:55:56,641 --> 01:55:57,510
the transition.

4564
01:55:59,190 --> 01:56:02,970
But these guys that are learning
everything as they go along.

4565
01:56:04,130 --> 01:56:04,910
Yeah.

4566
01:56:04,910 --> 01:56:07,040
Do you think he could a data
girl like Rhonda Rousey,

4567
01:56:07,041 --> 01:56:07,521
Jimmy Smith,

4568
01:56:07,521 --> 01:56:08,870
if you were a single guy date,

4569
01:56:10,080 --> 01:56:10,321
let's,

4570
01:56:10,321 --> 01:56:11,700
let's use some word finishes here.

4571
01:56:11,760 --> 01:56:13,010
I use the word date.

4572
01:56:13,030 --> 01:56:15,480
A lot of people were being
nice or being nice here.

4573
01:56:15,870 --> 01:56:16,441
Could I date?

4574
01:56:16,441 --> 01:56:16,920
Yes.

4575
01:56:16,920 --> 01:56:17,341
Could you,

4576
01:56:17,341 --> 01:56:17,641
could you,

4577
01:56:17,641 --> 01:56:18,680
could that be your girlfriend?

4578
01:56:18,710 --> 01:56:21,090
They can handle that crazy.

4579
01:56:21,360 --> 01:56:21,840
And I,

4580
01:56:21,840 --> 01:56:22,021
well,

4581
01:56:22,021 --> 01:56:25,380
it's weird because I tend to
attract a lot of crazy women.

4582
01:56:25,740 --> 01:56:26,573
Uh,

4583
01:56:26,700 --> 01:56:27,350
no way.

4584
01:56:27,350 --> 01:56:27,700
Yeah,

4585
01:56:27,700 --> 01:56:28,231
no way.

4586
01:56:28,231 --> 01:56:28,950
I don't believe in,

4587
01:56:28,950 --> 01:56:29,420
Oh man,

4588
01:56:29,420 --> 01:56:30,253
this room.

4589
01:56:30,300 --> 01:56:30,511
Yeah.

4590
01:56:30,511 --> 01:56:31,081
Seriously.

4591
01:56:31,081 --> 01:56:31,730
Ever do you mean?

4592
01:56:31,730 --> 01:56:32,041
He's like,

4593
01:56:32,041 --> 01:56:33,060
it's not even my fault.

4594
01:56:33,780 --> 01:56:34,471
Not Crazy.

4595
01:56:34,471 --> 01:56:35,310
I'm not interested.

4596
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:36,521
But yeah,

4597
01:56:36,521 --> 01:56:36,961
I'm seriously.

4598
01:56:36,961 --> 01:56:37,794
Then

4599
01:56:38,730 --> 01:56:39,780
when we get to talk about,

4600
01:56:40,110 --> 01:56:40,771
I'm crazy.

4601
01:56:40,771 --> 01:56:41,604
If you're not crazy,

4602
01:56:41,740 --> 01:56:42,031
you're not.

4603
01:56:42,031 --> 01:56:44,280
At least a little nuts
is not going to work out.

4604
01:56:44,460 --> 01:56:45,420
It's just talk right now.

4605
01:56:47,950 --> 01:56:48,590
Yeah.

4606
01:56:48,590 --> 01:56:50,630
Good Front kicks to the body by Ferera.

4607
01:56:51,910 --> 01:56:52,743
Right.

4608
01:56:54,270 --> 01:56:55,500
Oh Nice.

4609
01:56:55,510 --> 01:56:57,960
I cut him up and sliced them up.

4610
01:56:57,961 --> 01:56:58,261
Nice.

4611
01:56:58,261 --> 01:57:03,261
One nasty cut and it's
Oh beautiful tape down.

4612
01:57:03,600 --> 01:57:04,650
Yeah he's strong as fuck.

4613
01:57:04,651 --> 01:57:05,490
That's a big boy.

4614
01:57:06,350 --> 01:57:10,620
He is large is huge for one 85 it's
almost hard to believe when you stand next

4615
01:57:10,621 --> 01:57:11,640
to him then he makes that weight.

4616
01:57:11,670 --> 01:57:12,330
Wow.

4617
01:57:12,330 --> 01:57:14,940
Cause I weigh 185 so
how's that Guy Hunter?

4618
01:57:14,970 --> 01:57:15,990
It doesn't make any sense.

4619
01:57:16,500 --> 01:57:18,360
And I'm like you're a way bigger than me.

4620
01:57:18,680 --> 01:57:19,880
Andrew is fucked up man.

4621
01:57:19,890 --> 01:57:20,790
He's really bloody.

4622
01:57:21,680 --> 01:57:22,070
Okay.

4623
01:57:22,070 --> 01:57:23,450
That is something a lot of people ask me.

4624
01:57:23,451 --> 01:57:23,610
You know,

4625
01:57:23,610 --> 01:57:27,740
cause you know I've been in the
sports since about 2001 ish,

4626
01:57:27,860 --> 01:57:28,760
2000 I guess.

4627
01:57:29,150 --> 01:57:29,983
And uh,

4628
01:57:30,110 --> 01:57:30,291
hey,

4629
01:57:30,291 --> 01:57:31,071
what's changed the most?

4630
01:57:31,071 --> 01:57:32,060
I go wait,

4631
01:57:32,061 --> 01:57:35,840
cutting has guys are so much bigger
than they used to be that you should be.

4632
01:57:36,080 --> 01:57:37,580
Pretty much just wrestlers did that.

4633
01:57:37,850 --> 01:57:38,930
Now everybody does it.

4634
01:57:38,990 --> 01:57:39,321
Dude.

4635
01:57:39,321 --> 01:57:44,321
Andrew Craig is a mask of blood that
is bad and it's right over the eye,

4636
01:57:44,721 --> 01:57:46,940
which is a bad place
to get good irrigated.

4637
01:57:47,180 --> 01:57:48,350
He's trying to get back up

4638
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,820
and say's there's got his back
now defend that left hook.

4639
01:57:52,850 --> 01:57:53,690
Oh son,

4640
01:57:53,900 --> 01:57:55,040
I never have some ask you.

4641
01:57:55,550 --> 01:57:58,400
Have you ever had a cut
roughly that nasty in a fight?

4642
01:57:58,570 --> 01:57:59,403
No.

4643
01:57:59,620 --> 01:58:00,070
Never.

4644
01:58:00,070 --> 01:58:00,610
No.

4645
01:58:00,610 --> 01:58:02,680
I was always wondering if there's just,

4646
01:58:03,420 --> 01:58:06,060
cause it never really bothered me getting
hit and I never really got cut that

4647
01:58:06,061 --> 01:58:06,894
bad.

4648
01:58:07,170 --> 01:58:09,270
But you see it cause you
don't see what we're seeing.

4649
01:58:09,271 --> 01:58:10,110
You don't know where it is.

4650
01:58:10,111 --> 01:58:11,970
You don't know exactly how deep it is.

4651
01:58:11,971 --> 01:58:12,601
You can't see it.

4652
01:58:12,601 --> 01:58:14,640
And suddenly my eyes are full of blood.

4653
01:58:15,900 --> 01:58:16,500
It's just,

4654
01:58:16,500 --> 01:58:17,580
that's gotta be a moment you go,

4655
01:58:17,590 --> 01:58:18,423
oh shit.

4656
01:58:18,480 --> 01:58:20,130
That is a gap because that's a battle.

4657
01:58:20,131 --> 01:58:21,140
Cause you don't know how bad it is.

4658
01:58:21,150 --> 01:58:23,820
One time I still have stitches
in my eye in practice.

4659
01:58:24,030 --> 01:58:24,241
Yeah.

4660
01:58:24,241 --> 01:58:25,350
But I just Bam.

4661
01:58:25,351 --> 01:58:27,660
And then we're looking
at the ceiling just like,

4662
01:58:27,690 --> 01:58:28,360
ah,

4663
01:58:28,360 --> 01:58:28,511
I don't,

4664
01:58:28,511 --> 01:58:30,060
all I heard was had Chris,

4665
01:58:31,170 --> 01:58:31,621
this kid,

4666
01:58:31,621 --> 01:58:32,940
this Japanese kid is just,

4667
01:58:33,080 --> 01:58:34,380
it was freaky athlete.

4668
01:58:34,381 --> 01:58:34,561
Good.

4669
01:58:34,561 --> 01:58:35,150
Yeah.

4670
01:58:35,150 --> 01:58:39,990
Just jump knee me in the face when I was
shooting and just last in my eye open.

4671
01:58:39,991 --> 01:58:40,710
It was just like,

4672
01:58:40,710 --> 01:58:41,610
I'm surprised it hasn't,

4673
01:58:41,620 --> 01:58:42,310
doesn't open.

4674
01:58:42,310 --> 01:58:43,180
It's still got stitches in it.

4675
01:58:43,181 --> 01:58:43,900
You can feel them.

4676
01:58:43,900 --> 01:58:45,730
So they did dissolve
and it's one of those,

4677
01:58:45,731 --> 01:58:46,031
no,

4678
01:58:46,031 --> 01:58:47,110
this was the long time ago.

4679
01:58:47,170 --> 01:58:48,490
They were just never gonna pull out.

4680
01:58:48,520 --> 01:58:49,180
No,

4681
01:58:49,180 --> 01:58:50,590
I guess I'm supposed to do that.

4682
01:58:50,740 --> 01:58:51,190
Yeah.

4683
01:58:51,190 --> 01:58:51,760
Yeah.

4684
01:58:51,760 --> 01:58:52,301
That sounds good.

4685
01:58:52,301 --> 01:58:53,830
It was cause I was fighting soon.

4686
01:58:53,831 --> 01:58:55,330
And then this is left tomorrow.

4687
01:58:55,390 --> 01:58:56,170
Yeah.

4688
01:58:56,170 --> 01:58:56,591
By the way,

4689
01:58:56,591 --> 01:58:56,810
for,

4690
01:58:56,810 --> 01:58:57,700
it's got a nice run naked,

4691
01:58:57,701 --> 01:59:00,690
but he can extend his back
because he's up against the cage.

4692
01:59:00,700 --> 01:59:01,240
Yeah,

4693
01:59:01,240 --> 01:59:02,110
that's a real problem.

4694
01:59:02,280 --> 01:59:02,971
But his hips into it.

4695
01:59:02,971 --> 01:59:03,190
Yeah.

4696
01:59:03,190 --> 01:59:04,360
That's the benefit of the,

4697
01:59:04,361 --> 01:59:05,194
the ring.

4698
01:59:05,710 --> 01:59:06,430
Oh No,

4699
01:59:06,430 --> 01:59:07,263
now he's got it.

4700
01:59:07,930 --> 01:59:08,741
Now I might be in trouble.

4701
01:59:08,741 --> 01:59:09,574
I can extend.

4702
01:59:09,910 --> 01:59:10,241
Well,

4703
01:59:10,241 --> 01:59:11,950
Andrew's actually scooting back.

4704
01:59:14,510 --> 01:59:15,950
That body triangle sucks.

4705
01:59:15,951 --> 01:59:16,611
A Fat Dick.

4706
01:59:16,611 --> 01:59:17,090
Doesn't that.

4707
01:59:17,090 --> 01:59:17,810
Ah,

4708
01:59:17,810 --> 01:59:18,171
for me,

4709
01:59:18,171 --> 01:59:18,790
I had me on.

4710
01:59:18,790 --> 01:59:20,750
They had me with that for
the first round of our fight.

4711
01:59:20,780 --> 01:59:22,130
Worst feeling and he just,

4712
01:59:22,131 --> 01:59:23,120
I couldn't get him off.

4713
01:59:23,540 --> 01:59:24,560
I kept was impossible.

4714
01:59:24,620 --> 01:59:27,050
The worst is when a guy's got
your back and your belly down.

4715
01:59:27,290 --> 01:59:28,730
That body triangle is locked in.

4716
01:59:29,150 --> 01:59:30,430
Just such a stretch for you,

4717
01:59:30,980 --> 01:59:31,251
Tony.

4718
01:59:31,251 --> 01:59:31,701
Frequent.

4719
01:59:31,701 --> 01:59:32,270
Yeah.

4720
01:59:32,270 --> 01:59:32,960
Tapped out to that.

4721
01:59:32,960 --> 01:59:34,400
Ivan salivary got 'em.

4722
01:59:35,850 --> 01:59:37,050
Another great example of that is,

4723
01:59:37,051 --> 01:59:37,884
um,

4724
01:59:38,790 --> 01:59:42,420
Anderson Silva beat High Alto
Saccharine and had a by Joan.

4725
01:59:42,421 --> 01:59:43,111
She was beaten.

4726
01:59:43,111 --> 01:59:43,801
The dog should,

4727
01:59:43,801 --> 01:59:46,230
I haven't been shoot though
for the old school fans.

4728
01:59:46,350 --> 01:59:48,540
He's switching it back as long time ago.

4729
01:59:48,541 --> 01:59:49,374
Man.

4730
01:59:49,550 --> 01:59:50,820
Ferraris keeps trying,

4731
01:59:50,821 --> 01:59:52,890
but Andrew Craig is not
giving up me in a minute.

4732
01:59:52,970 --> 01:59:53,420
Sorry guys.

4733
01:59:53,420 --> 01:59:54,500
One of my favorites of all time.

4734
01:59:54,840 --> 01:59:55,640
Right y'all dude,

4735
01:59:55,640 --> 01:59:56,660
I love how it's a soccer.

4736
01:59:56,661 --> 01:59:57,590
That old school highlight.

4737
01:59:58,070 --> 01:59:58,450
Awesome.

4738
01:59:58,450 --> 01:59:58,970
Love it.

4739
01:59:58,970 --> 02:00:02,210
Dennett Dennett part
willing over the garden.

4740
02:00:02,211 --> 02:00:02,680
Shit.

4741
02:00:02,680 --> 02:00:05,590
That was a fight that I was bummed out
when he fought gummy and pride and he

4742
02:00:05,591 --> 02:00:06,430
came out with his leg.

4743
02:00:06,431 --> 02:00:08,650
All Mama fucked up and
you knew he was fucked up.

4744
02:00:08,950 --> 02:00:10,870
He knew he was injured
going into that fight

4745
02:00:11,120 --> 02:00:13,100
and he always got screwed
at the head and arm throw.

4746
02:00:13,101 --> 02:00:15,050
He try and it like innocent Sylvia,

4747
02:00:15,051 --> 02:00:15,920
if you slip,

4748
02:00:16,100 --> 02:00:18,830
you get your back taken and you did
that against Gomi did that again.

4749
02:00:18,831 --> 02:00:19,270
Silva,

4750
02:00:19,270 --> 02:00:19,840
same thing.

4751
02:00:19,840 --> 02:00:22,360
The Japanese use that
they go out there to die.

4752
02:00:22,580 --> 02:00:22,990
Yeah.

4753
02:00:22,990 --> 02:00:24,550
I mean they are savages.

4754
02:00:24,730 --> 02:00:25,161
I was ring,

4755
02:00:25,161 --> 02:00:26,980
so it was before ever
even worked for the UFC.

4756
02:00:26,981 --> 02:00:27,630
I was uh,

4757
02:00:27,630 --> 02:00:31,810
I was cage side when Matt Hughes fought
them in the UFC and that was when it was

4758
02:00:31,811 --> 02:00:32,230
evident.

4759
02:00:32,230 --> 02:00:33,800
The difference between
a guy who cuts weight,

4760
02:00:34,040 --> 02:00:36,400
he's a big strong wrestler and
the guy who doesn't soccer,

4761
02:00:36,401 --> 02:00:38,320
I just did not belong
in there with bad news.

4762
02:00:38,350 --> 02:00:39,050
Yeah.

4763
02:00:39,050 --> 02:00:39,310
Mad.

4764
02:00:39,310 --> 02:00:40,300
He was just mauled him.

4765
02:00:40,620 --> 02:00:44,040
It was just too big and too good
at the time that's hanging on.

4766
02:00:44,660 --> 02:00:46,060
Oh

4767
02:00:47,970 --> 02:00:48,731
my goodness.

4768
02:00:48,731 --> 02:00:49,690
Head kicked him.

4769
02:00:51,650 --> 02:00:52,140
Okay.

4770
02:00:52,140 --> 02:00:54,000
This would be Khloe.

4771
02:00:54,380 --> 02:00:55,213
Jesus,

4772
02:00:55,320 --> 02:00:56,310
he's fucked up.

4773
02:00:56,340 --> 02:00:57,330
He's fucked.

4774
02:00:58,410 --> 02:00:59,071
Andrew Craig,

4775
02:00:59,071 --> 02:01:01,360
his game as fuck and

4776
02:01:03,180 --> 02:01:04,740
he cannot see the punches coming.

4777
02:01:05,010 --> 02:01:06,300
He can't see the right hand.

4778
02:01:06,510 --> 02:01:07,620
Oh my goodness.

4779
02:01:08,760 --> 02:01:09,690
Oh my God.

4780
02:01:09,691 --> 02:01:11,340
Can't let off the gas now,

4781
02:01:11,390 --> 02:01:12,070
but he doesn't have it.

4782
02:01:12,070 --> 02:01:13,110
He will lose the fight.

4783
02:01:13,140 --> 02:01:13,531
He's a lot.

4784
02:01:13,531 --> 02:01:15,180
He's a gave a pint of blood back there.

4785
02:01:15,181 --> 02:01:16,050
When you're sitting down.

4786
02:01:16,290 --> 02:01:16,481
Oh,

4787
02:01:16,481 --> 02:01:17,610
we tagged them again.

4788
02:01:17,730 --> 02:01:18,630
It's got to finish him.

4789
02:01:18,720 --> 02:01:19,590
You gotta finish him.

4790
02:01:19,591 --> 02:01:20,220
Jump on him.

4791
02:01:20,220 --> 02:01:20,620
There we go.

4792
02:01:20,620 --> 02:01:22,050
Keep landing that and fucking right hand

4793
02:01:24,380 --> 02:01:24,831
for our can.

4794
02:01:24,831 --> 02:01:25,820
Just jump guard right now.

4795
02:01:25,880 --> 02:01:28,430
You might just flop and jump guard.

4796
02:01:28,640 --> 02:01:30,470
He'll make it ready to wing that.

4797
02:01:30,480 --> 02:01:32,020
Ross didn't do it.

4798
02:01:32,021 --> 02:01:32,781
It's like here comes,

4799
02:01:32,781 --> 02:01:33,371
here comes the bed,

4800
02:01:33,371 --> 02:01:34,240
pull the trigger and time.

4801
02:01:34,250 --> 02:01:35,083
Wow.

4802
02:01:36,620 --> 02:01:37,311
I don't know.

4803
02:01:37,311 --> 02:01:37,701
Wow.

4804
02:01:37,701 --> 02:01:38,450
That's interesting.

4805
02:01:38,450 --> 02:01:39,170
Wow.

4806
02:01:39,170 --> 02:01:40,730
You know the cut is one thing,

4807
02:01:40,820 --> 02:01:42,230
but you get past the cut.

4808
02:01:42,290 --> 02:01:43,460
Who did more damage.

4809
02:01:43,490 --> 02:01:44,090
Yeah.

4810
02:01:44,090 --> 02:01:44,511
You know,

4811
02:01:44,511 --> 02:01:45,344
I mean

4812
02:01:46,610 --> 02:01:47,810
it is a nasty cut,

4813
02:01:47,990 --> 02:01:49,580
but he also threatened with rear naked.

4814
02:01:49,900 --> 02:01:51,710
I mean not really.

4815
02:01:52,160 --> 02:01:53,430
It never looked like it was closed.

4816
02:01:53,450 --> 02:01:56,450
That was the closest that head
kick and those combinations.

4817
02:01:56,570 --> 02:01:57,830
That's an interesting case.

4818
02:01:57,890 --> 02:02:00,370
As far as like judging around,

4819
02:02:00,560 --> 02:02:01,940
if I was going to judge that round,

4820
02:02:01,941 --> 02:02:05,390
I think I would be inclined to give
it to him because he had kicked him,

4821
02:02:05,480 --> 02:02:07,340
had him rocked chasing him.

4822
02:02:07,430 --> 02:02:09,590
He was way closer to being ended.

4823
02:02:09,740 --> 02:02:11,360
Then a guy defending the back.

4824
02:02:11,450 --> 02:02:12,283
You know what guys?

4825
02:02:12,320 --> 02:02:15,470
Guys defend the back for a whole
round and they're fine the next round,

4826
02:02:15,740 --> 02:02:16,580
he's not fine.

4827
02:02:16,610 --> 02:02:17,570
He got fucked up.

4828
02:02:17,810 --> 02:02:18,051
You know,

4829
02:02:18,051 --> 02:02:18,950
he got head kicked,

4830
02:02:18,951 --> 02:02:19,790
he got cracked.

4831
02:02:20,390 --> 02:02:21,020
But that's,

4832
02:02:21,020 --> 02:02:25,010
that highlights the real problem with a
10 point must boxing system being used

4833
02:02:25,011 --> 02:02:28,580
in MMA and not being even used
correctly or the problem is,

4834
02:02:28,581 --> 02:02:29,530
is that the equal

4835
02:02:29,570 --> 02:02:31,180
criteria according to Muslim is,

4836
02:02:31,220 --> 02:02:33,020
is effective striking
in a fit of grappling.

4837
02:02:33,410 --> 02:02:37,640
Well affective grappling
doesn't cut a guy up,

4838
02:02:37,641 --> 02:02:38,870
doesn't leave a lot of marks.

4839
02:02:38,960 --> 02:02:40,790
Affective striking guys on roller skates.

4840
02:02:40,791 --> 02:02:41,990
It's ways you to see.

4841
02:02:42,260 --> 02:02:42,650
So yeah,

4842
02:02:42,650 --> 02:02:43,431
so judging wise,

4843
02:02:43,431 --> 02:02:44,540
it's very difficult to deal with.

4844
02:02:44,710 --> 02:02:45,543
Really difficult.

4845
02:02:45,560 --> 02:02:46,100
It's true.

4846
02:02:46,100 --> 02:02:46,933
Very true.

4847
02:02:47,060 --> 02:02:47,780
Very true.

4848
02:02:47,780 --> 02:02:48,800
I've seen guys get school.

4849
02:02:48,801 --> 02:02:49,520
I mean that's,

4850
02:02:49,520 --> 02:02:49,790
you know,

4851
02:02:49,790 --> 02:02:51,620
the great thing about
Jujitsu when we train it,

4852
02:02:51,621 --> 02:02:53,300
I mean you can go with a world champion.

4853
02:02:53,301 --> 02:02:54,290
All you do is tap a lot.

4854
02:02:54,560 --> 02:02:54,970
Yeah.

4855
02:02:54,970 --> 02:02:55,290
You know,

4856
02:02:55,290 --> 02:02:56,123
it doesn't,

4857
02:02:56,420 --> 02:02:58,100
if you go 10 rounds of mallet pet,

4858
02:02:58,101 --> 02:02:58,311
you know,

4859
02:02:58,311 --> 02:02:59,960
you're like glue in your
limbs back together.

4860
02:03:00,050 --> 02:03:00,441
You know,

4861
02:03:00,441 --> 02:03:01,950
it just doesn't even in sparring.

4862
02:03:02,270 --> 02:03:04,260
So you know with grapple,

4863
02:03:04,261 --> 02:03:05,270
that's a great part of it is,

4864
02:03:05,360 --> 02:03:05,691
Oh shit,

4865
02:03:05,691 --> 02:03:06,524
I just got pinned a lot.

4866
02:03:06,750 --> 02:03:07,910
It was unfortunate.

4867
02:03:07,911 --> 02:03:08,721
But you're okay.

4868
02:03:08,721 --> 02:03:11,060
The next day I tell you a little bit
because you have these two brothers from

4869
02:03:11,061 --> 02:03:15,350
the Arctic Jujitsu that train
does strength conditioning
with me and I'm like,

4870
02:03:15,600 --> 02:03:16,730
just stick with Jujitsu.

4871
02:03:17,600 --> 02:03:18,560
Don't we get beat up for a living,

4872
02:03:18,570 --> 02:03:19,850
don't have to worry about getting punched.

4873
02:03:19,880 --> 02:03:20,571
Hopefully your sport,

4874
02:03:20,571 --> 02:03:20,841
we'll take,

4875
02:03:20,841 --> 02:03:22,490
we'll start making you some money.

4876
02:03:23,780 --> 02:03:24,050
They're like,

4877
02:03:24,050 --> 02:03:24,831
we don't want to get punched.

4878
02:03:24,831 --> 02:03:25,041
I'm like,

4879
02:03:25,041 --> 02:03:25,340
good.

4880
02:03:25,340 --> 02:03:26,061
If you don't get to ask,

4881
02:03:26,061 --> 02:03:26,160
you

4882
02:03:26,160 --> 02:03:27,720
really want to fight him and May.

4883
02:03:27,721 --> 02:03:29,310
You definitely shouldn't fight MMA.

4884
02:03:29,400 --> 02:03:29,570
No,

4885
02:03:29,570 --> 02:03:29,950
you just,

4886
02:03:29,950 --> 02:03:30,751
you just shouldn't do it.

4887
02:03:30,751 --> 02:03:34,530
It's gotta be something that
is an obsession to you and
if it's not an obsession

4888
02:03:34,531 --> 02:03:34,980
to you,

4889
02:03:34,980 --> 02:03:36,270
avoided at all costs,

4890
02:03:36,271 --> 02:03:36,910
man.

4891
02:03:36,910 --> 02:03:40,240
Nice little surfer kids who were
like eight or 10 and they just like,

4892
02:03:40,241 --> 02:03:40,421
yeah,

4893
02:03:40,421 --> 02:03:40,960
we just,

4894
02:03:40,960 --> 02:03:42,240
we just want to do too and surf.

4895
02:03:42,260 --> 02:03:42,550
I'm like,

4896
02:03:42,550 --> 02:03:43,383
there you go.

4897
02:03:43,590 --> 02:03:44,440
Sounds beautiful.

4898
02:03:44,441 --> 02:03:46,810
And say the Ferera for
I probably deserved it.

4899
02:03:47,170 --> 02:03:48,003
Yeah.

4900
02:03:48,340 --> 02:03:49,210
Very interesting.

4901
02:03:49,240 --> 02:03:50,740
I think he's going to remember
that last round though.

4902
02:03:50,920 --> 02:03:51,310
No,

4903
02:03:51,310 --> 02:03:52,240
very interesting.

4904
02:03:52,241 --> 02:03:53,040
Good fight.

4905
02:03:53,040 --> 02:03:54,640
And it shows how tough Andrew Craig is,

4906
02:03:54,641 --> 02:03:54,941
man.

4907
02:03:54,941 --> 02:03:57,970
Seriously tough as fuck here.

4908
02:03:58,030 --> 02:03:58,181
Oh,

4909
02:03:58,181 --> 02:03:59,080
they're showing the kick.

4910
02:03:59,110 --> 02:03:59,943
Oh no they're not.

4911
02:04:00,550 --> 02:04:03,790
That's just a straight
left that took them down.

4912
02:04:04,510 --> 02:04:04,751
Yeah,

4913
02:04:04,751 --> 02:04:07,510
they all again move with a
fight and all the guy who won.

4914
02:04:07,750 --> 02:04:08,540
Here's that elbow.

4915
02:04:08,540 --> 02:04:09,161
God Damn,

4916
02:04:09,161 --> 02:04:09,970
that was perfect.

4917
02:04:09,970 --> 02:04:11,650
That was beautiful.

4918
02:04:11,860 --> 02:04:13,450
That was like he hit
him with a razor blade.

4919
02:04:13,590 --> 02:04:13,770
Lou.

4920
02:04:13,770 --> 02:04:14,970
That perfect.

4921
02:04:15,280 --> 02:04:17,650
And here's just power end technique.

4922
02:04:17,651 --> 02:04:19,330
Look at this rotation of the body,

4923
02:04:19,540 --> 02:04:20,350
the legs,

4924
02:04:20,350 --> 02:04:21,730
some core strength son.

4925
02:04:22,090 --> 02:04:22,923
Boom.

4926
02:04:23,290 --> 02:04:26,570
And you see that Gash is
immediately Plickers glop.

4927
02:04:26,580 --> 02:04:28,420
A blood landed on his shoulder.

4928
02:04:28,510 --> 02:04:29,343
Amazing.

4929
02:04:30,220 --> 02:04:33,520
Who's like at an all time
favorite fighters to watch.

4930
02:04:33,610 --> 02:04:35,500
Who's like your all time
favorite fighter watch.

4931
02:04:35,560 --> 02:04:39,070
I think my all time favorite
if I were to is how to Sakkara.

4932
02:04:39,070 --> 02:04:41,660
He was like my favorite finding
shooto love watching that guy.

4933
02:04:42,010 --> 02:04:42,843
Loved watching him.

4934
02:04:43,050 --> 02:04:48,050
I think prime vandelays mine and I'm
anyone's grand prime Vandelay was so

4935
02:04:48,571 --> 02:04:49,740
fucking crazy.

4936
02:04:49,890 --> 02:04:50,110
It was.

4937
02:04:50,110 --> 02:04:51,150
It was so wild.

4938
02:04:51,151 --> 02:04:51,700
Smiling,

4939
02:04:51,700 --> 02:04:54,390
stomping on the what I used to
love when he would do this thing.

4940
02:04:54,780 --> 02:04:55,081
Oh,

4941
02:04:55,081 --> 02:04:56,230
don't get in a fight Lucy.

4942
02:04:57,150 --> 02:04:58,050
Oh fuck yeah,

4943
02:04:58,051 --> 02:04:59,250
man he was,

4944
02:04:59,280 --> 02:05:00,930
he was so mad dog.

4945
02:05:00,931 --> 02:05:02,070
Like when he fought rampage,

4946
02:05:02,071 --> 02:05:03,270
those two fights with rampage.

4947
02:05:03,720 --> 02:05:05,670
He was so mad dog.

4948
02:05:05,820 --> 02:05:08,550
Just mad dog need him 50 times.

4949
02:05:08,990 --> 02:05:09,990
He was so crazy.

4950
02:05:10,410 --> 02:05:11,970
It was so fun to watch him man,

4951
02:05:11,971 --> 02:05:13,140
when he was at his best.

4952
02:05:13,230 --> 02:05:15,330
He was just so ferocious,

4953
02:05:15,600 --> 02:05:16,950
so ferocious.

4954
02:05:17,410 --> 02:05:17,701
You know?

4955
02:05:17,701 --> 02:05:20,850
It's funny like Phil Baroni was
talking about at once and he was like,

4956
02:05:21,330 --> 02:05:23,400
fucking let everybody do fucking steroids.

4957
02:05:23,750 --> 02:05:24,001
He goes,

4958
02:05:24,001 --> 02:05:26,910
I don't want to see choose to
Vandelay back when he was in pride,

4959
02:05:26,911 --> 02:05:27,870
when he was at his best.

4960
02:05:28,270 --> 02:05:29,130
I was laughing,

4961
02:05:29,131 --> 02:05:29,671
but I was like,

4962
02:05:29,671 --> 02:05:32,190
part of me agrees with that.

4963
02:05:32,191 --> 02:05:33,750
Like as a fan,

4964
02:05:33,900 --> 02:05:38,220
just a fan of the spectacle
of Vandelay Silva of Cro,

4965
02:05:38,221 --> 02:05:39,870
cop of the guys when
they were at their best.

4966
02:05:40,290 --> 02:05:42,510
I know that was fun to watch.

4967
02:05:42,720 --> 02:05:44,310
Vandelay in his prime was fun to watch.

4968
02:05:44,670 --> 02:05:44,911
I know.

4969
02:05:44,911 --> 02:05:46,380
Who knows what he was actually on.

4970
02:05:46,410 --> 02:05:50,040
I'm just assuming we're
not medical professionals.

4971
02:05:50,490 --> 02:05:52,830
We all know that people take things.

4972
02:05:52,831 --> 02:05:52,981
I mean,

4973
02:05:52,981 --> 02:05:55,440
he's a reason why this
chill son and news is out.

4974
02:05:55,590 --> 02:05:57,570
There's a reason why
it's not that surprising.

4975
02:05:57,600 --> 02:05:58,440
It's not like,

4976
02:05:58,680 --> 02:05:59,513
you know,

4977
02:05:59,850 --> 02:06:03,510
it's not the first thing he's cheated
when people take things they just do.

4978
02:06:03,690 --> 02:06:06,660
And especially when you talked to a guy
like ensign who tells you that no one

4979
02:06:06,661 --> 02:06:10,290
got tested and that the fucking contract
said we will not test you force bat

4980
02:06:10,291 --> 02:06:13,590
roids and then in Brazil you can get
steroids the same place you get gum.

4981
02:06:13,900 --> 02:06:14,370
Yeah.

4982
02:06:14,370 --> 02:06:14,970
I mean,

4983
02:06:14,970 --> 02:06:18,000
oh I'll take a pack of gum
and fucking nozzle all.

4984
02:06:18,001 --> 02:06:19,170
Go ahead and throw that in there too.

4985
02:06:19,171 --> 02:06:20,970
Something with a horse on the label.

4986
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:21,770
You mean that Oh,

4987
02:06:21,770 --> 02:06:25,050
Calvin gasoline and Nico Moose
Soki he's gotten so good.

4988
02:06:25,140 --> 02:06:25,973
Fuck cashless.

4989
02:06:26,710 --> 02:06:27,280
Striking.

4990
02:06:27,280 --> 02:06:28,830
Fucking ridiculous.

4991
02:06:29,070 --> 02:06:33,570
The looseness of his striking his
boxing against Rick story was really,

4992
02:06:33,600 --> 02:06:34,620
really impressive.

4993
02:06:35,130 --> 02:06:37,770
But fucking kids
struggling to make weight.

4994
02:06:37,920 --> 02:06:39,750
And Mike Dolce is a motherfucker dude.

4995
02:06:39,960 --> 02:06:43,200
Like Joe Dolce took a
picture cause after he lost,

4996
02:06:43,201 --> 02:06:46,620
he didn't make weight again and they
asked him why stopped using dolce said

4997
02:06:46,920 --> 02:06:48,300
cause dolce was too expensive.

4998
02:06:48,480 --> 02:06:52,920
So dolce took a picture of him making
weight easy at one 70 and then he wrote

4999
02:06:52,921 --> 02:06:54,930
Hashtag worth every penny,

5000
02:06:57,030 --> 02:06:58,620
which is a fucked up.

5001
02:06:59,010 --> 02:06:59,843
It's true.

5002
02:06:59,880 --> 02:07:01,690
But there's a moose.

5003
02:07:01,710 --> 02:07:02,543
Okay.

5004
02:07:03,560 --> 02:07:04,470
I've never seen this kid.

5005
02:07:04,590 --> 02:07:05,430
Oh He's good man.

5006
02:07:05,730 --> 02:07:05,971
Yeah,

5007
02:07:05,971 --> 02:07:07,410
I saw him for the first time.

5008
02:07:07,460 --> 02:07:08,293
Um,

5009
02:07:08,310 --> 02:07:09,143
last year.

5010
02:07:11,560 --> 02:07:12,760
Calvin gasoline though.

5011
02:07:13,150 --> 02:07:17,110
I'm wondering what it's going to be
like with him coming off of that,

5012
02:07:17,170 --> 02:07:17,500
uh,

5013
02:07:17,500 --> 02:07:19,330
that loss or coming off of that,

5014
02:07:19,331 --> 02:07:19,570
um,

5015
02:07:19,570 --> 02:07:20,403
that weight cut.

5016
02:07:20,670 --> 02:07:21,850
Cause that's a hard wait.

5017
02:07:21,851 --> 02:07:22,340
Cut.

5018
02:07:22,340 --> 02:07:23,500
If that he didn't make,

5019
02:07:23,680 --> 02:07:25,560
he didn't make it promotionally.

5020
02:07:25,570 --> 02:07:26,800
And once again,

5021
02:07:26,801 --> 02:07:27,071
man,

5022
02:07:27,071 --> 02:07:29,890
if you're getting into
this game promotionally it,

5023
02:07:29,891 --> 02:07:31,930
it makes you so hard to deal with it.

5024
02:07:31,950 --> 02:07:32,711
It makes you very,

5025
02:07:32,711 --> 02:07:33,570
they hate that.

5026
02:07:33,571 --> 02:07:33,750
Yeah.

5027
02:07:33,750 --> 02:07:35,170
I mean they hate that with a passion.

5028
02:07:35,290 --> 02:07:37,900
Very hard to promote a guy
who does it make weight.

5029
02:07:37,930 --> 02:07:39,160
It's how much should
we put behind this guy?

5030
02:07:39,200 --> 02:07:40,540
Don't know if it's getting
on the scale and make it,

5031
02:07:40,560 --> 02:07:40,780
yeah,

5032
02:07:40,780 --> 02:07:41,561
it can really,

5033
02:07:41,561 --> 02:07:42,460
really kill your career.

5034
02:07:42,461 --> 02:07:45,070
It ruins irrelevance if a
fight ruins it completely.

5035
02:07:45,280 --> 02:07:46,113
Yeah.

5036
02:07:46,450 --> 02:07:46,841
Well we,

5037
02:07:46,841 --> 02:07:47,410
we do,

5038
02:07:47,410 --> 02:07:48,850
we talked about it a little bit before,

5039
02:07:48,851 --> 02:07:53,851
but is there a way that you can have
guys weigh in the day of the fight?

5040
02:07:54,220 --> 02:07:54,910
Is there,

5041
02:07:54,910 --> 02:07:57,340
I mean my thought I had a crazy idea.

5042
02:07:57,341 --> 02:07:58,210
It's not a good idea,

5043
02:07:58,240 --> 02:07:59,040
but look,

5044
02:07:59,040 --> 02:08:01,240
you could have an understudy like you,

5045
02:08:01,241 --> 02:08:02,680
like you know how they do at Broadway.

5046
02:08:02,770 --> 02:08:03,820
Like if a guy gets hurt,

5047
02:08:03,940 --> 02:08:04,930
the show must go on.

5048
02:08:04,931 --> 02:08:07,900
They have a guy who actually knows the
role and he'll take the place if a guy

5049
02:08:08,260 --> 02:08:09,610
gets sick or something like that.

5050
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:14,590
Like if a guy does not weigh in at a
specific amount the day of the fight,

5051
02:08:14,620 --> 02:08:16,060
commentators don't have those by the way.

5052
02:08:16,740 --> 02:08:18,460
We've got to get on there
whether we have a voice or not.

5053
02:08:18,461 --> 02:08:18,571
Yeah,

5054
02:08:18,571 --> 02:08:19,404
we don't get drunk.

5055
02:08:20,860 --> 02:08:24,550
I wouldn't do so good math with that.

5056
02:08:25,980 --> 02:08:29,340
You want to get old tire
implement drug testing for MMA.

5057
02:08:30,550 --> 02:08:31,810
That's a wrap son.

5058
02:08:31,840 --> 02:08:32,673
It's been,

5059
02:08:33,640 --> 02:08:34,480
it's been great,

5060
02:08:34,750 --> 02:08:35,583
but it's over.

5061
02:08:35,950 --> 02:08:36,760
Um,

5062
02:08:36,760 --> 02:08:37,720
he fought a car.

5063
02:08:37,721 --> 02:08:38,140
That's who most,

5064
02:08:38,140 --> 02:08:38,810
okay fought.

5065
02:08:38,810 --> 02:08:39,820
And I saw him in,

5066
02:08:39,821 --> 02:08:43,810
in Manchester and Carmen
and armbar actually it was
a great fight up until that

5067
02:08:43,820 --> 02:08:44,430
too.

5068
02:08:44,430 --> 02:08:45,550
A ridiculous fight.

5069
02:08:45,700 --> 02:08:46,870
So understudies,

5070
02:08:46,960 --> 02:08:47,920
so if the guy doesn't make weight,

5071
02:08:47,921 --> 02:08:48,670
the other guy steps in.

5072
02:08:48,670 --> 02:08:49,150
Yeah.

5073
02:08:49,150 --> 02:08:51,100
So like the guy doesn't
get any of his purse.

5074
02:08:51,130 --> 02:08:52,570
He gets no money if he
doesn't make the weight.

5075
02:08:53,590 --> 02:08:58,090
So it seemed that he'd keep guys from
doing stupid shit like trying to lose 30

5076
02:08:58,091 --> 02:08:59,020
pounds in a day,

5077
02:08:59,320 --> 02:08:59,680
you know,

5078
02:08:59,680 --> 02:09:00,760
which we've all seen,

5079
02:09:00,790 --> 02:09:01,623
we've all seen,

5080
02:09:01,630 --> 02:09:02,740
I saw Travis Luder,

5081
02:09:02,741 --> 02:09:05,350
I'm never seen a guy closer to
death that went on to fight.

5082
02:09:05,560 --> 02:09:07,150
Never saw a guy looks so bad.

5083
02:09:07,390 --> 02:09:11,260
Travis Luder came in way overweight
and tried real hard to make it.

5084
02:09:11,290 --> 02:09:12,550
But the first,

5085
02:09:12,670 --> 02:09:16,030
the first time he was like two
and a half over and then he just,

5086
02:09:16,031 --> 02:09:17,060
he couldn't lose any more.

5087
02:09:17,100 --> 02:09:18,160
He tried really hard,

5088
02:09:18,161 --> 02:09:19,300
but he was so drunk.

5089
02:09:19,301 --> 02:09:19,841
Silva fight,

5090
02:09:19,841 --> 02:09:20,490
right?

5091
02:09:20,490 --> 02:09:20,830
Yeah,

5092
02:09:20,830 --> 02:09:21,070
it was.

5093
02:09:21,070 --> 02:09:23,230
So it was a non title fight
and then he got stopped.

5094
02:09:23,500 --> 02:09:25,630
He got caught in a
triangle and got elbowed.

5095
02:09:25,660 --> 02:09:27,440
He came close to winning
that got full mountain,

5096
02:09:27,441 --> 02:09:32,350
the first round tremor that going God
damn as Luther was a mother fucker,

5097
02:09:32,740 --> 02:09:34,000
he was one of those texts,

5098
02:09:34,001 --> 02:09:35,320
a strong dudes,

5099
02:09:35,620 --> 02:09:36,071
Texas,

5100
02:09:36,071 --> 02:09:40,960
tough guy do to learn Jujitsu and got
really fucking good taking tournaments out

5101
02:09:40,961 --> 02:09:41,794
here.

5102
02:09:41,830 --> 02:09:43,510
Charles McCarthy here on Gracie,

5103
02:09:43,570 --> 02:09:44,321
Charles McCarthy,

5104
02:09:44,321 --> 02:09:45,430
who I really respected,

5105
02:09:45,431 --> 02:09:49,700
he beat here on Gracie really here on
or hinder cause a big term out here and,

5106
02:09:49,701 --> 02:09:50,680
and he ended up winning it.

5107
02:09:50,710 --> 02:09:51,511
Luder end up winning it.

5108
02:09:51,511 --> 02:09:53,140
And I know here on an hinder when it,

5109
02:09:53,650 --> 02:09:54,640
I think you'd beat one of them.

5110
02:09:55,510 --> 02:09:57,010
Charles McCarthy was on
the ultimate fighter.

5111
02:09:57,011 --> 02:10:00,700
When you look that up and confirm
whether or not McCarthy said it was like

5112
02:10:00,701 --> 02:10:02,050
rolling with Laborio,

5113
02:10:02,290 --> 02:10:03,910
he said he's fucking good.

5114
02:10:03,911 --> 02:10:06,310
And that's an incredible compliment
saying that he's like rolling with,

5115
02:10:06,530 --> 02:10:07,090
I'll pull it up.

5116
02:10:07,090 --> 02:10:08,080
Travis Luder.

5117
02:10:08,830 --> 02:10:10,140
Travis Luder Jujitsu.

5118
02:10:10,180 --> 02:10:10,300
Yeah.

5119
02:10:10,300 --> 02:10:14,580
It was like an invitational out
here and he was a motherfucker.

5120
02:10:14,590 --> 02:10:15,070
Dude,

5121
02:10:15,070 --> 02:10:15,903
he's a motherfucker.

5122
02:10:15,910 --> 02:10:16,743
Just,

5123
02:10:16,780 --> 02:10:21,430
it gets trained too long with his own
people took too long before he eventually

5124
02:10:21,431 --> 02:10:22,390
went to Jackson's.

5125
02:10:22,750 --> 02:10:23,501
And by then,

5126
02:10:23,501 --> 02:10:24,334
um,

5127
02:10:24,670 --> 02:10:27,400
he wind up losing the Sapo to uh,

5128
02:10:28,150 --> 02:10:28,983
um,

5129
02:10:29,140 --> 02:10:29,820
what's his name?

5130
02:10:29,820 --> 02:10:30,653
Uh,

5131
02:10:31,180 --> 02:10:33,180
the guy who Tim Silvia or Tim.

5132
02:10:33,200 --> 02:10:34,490
I'm Tim Kennedy.

5133
02:10:34,491 --> 02:10:37,370
Knocked out in a half day on the tall.

5134
02:10:37,700 --> 02:10:38,180
Yeah.

5135
02:10:38,180 --> 02:10:38,880
Remember that guy?

5136
02:10:38,880 --> 02:10:39,080
Oh,

5137
02:10:39,080 --> 02:10:40,010
in the fight for the troops.

5138
02:10:40,430 --> 02:10:41,263
The troops.

5139
02:10:41,990 --> 02:10:45,110
I Dunno if they have this Jujitsu
reg rich Franklin beat him up too.

5140
02:10:45,111 --> 02:10:46,430
Man on his waist.

5141
02:10:46,440 --> 02:10:47,510
Just had no gas at all.

5142
02:10:47,720 --> 02:10:51,230
But he had rich Franklin down and
had them almost in an arm bar.

5143
02:10:51,680 --> 02:10:53,030
Travis Luder was a mother fucker.

5144
02:10:53,031 --> 02:10:54,530
I just didn't have good gas.

5145
02:10:54,531 --> 02:10:54,681
Yeah.

5146
02:10:54,681 --> 02:10:56,300
How found the towel was his last fight.

5147
02:10:56,660 --> 02:10:59,330
He got Kod and that was a 2010.

5148
02:10:59,510 --> 02:11:01,550
That's what gotten a towel into the UFC.

5149
02:11:02,780 --> 02:11:04,880
And before that he beat chasing Mcdonald.

5150
02:11:05,630 --> 02:11:06,080
He was a,

5151
02:11:06,080 --> 02:11:07,040
he's a beast man.

5152
02:11:07,041 --> 02:11:07,430
Yeah,

5153
02:11:07,430 --> 02:11:08,270
he was a beast,

5154
02:11:08,540 --> 02:11:10,340
but they caught up after
the rich Franklin fight.

5155
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,360
Just never quite reached his full,

5156
02:11:14,600 --> 02:11:15,590
full potential.

5157
02:11:15,800 --> 02:11:17,960
But he got guillotine by Matt Lindland.

5158
02:11:19,220 --> 02:11:20,600
[inaudible] was a motherfucker.

5159
02:11:20,870 --> 02:11:21,703
He was,

5160
02:11:22,310 --> 02:11:23,840
people forget how God Damn Good Matt,

5161
02:11:23,841 --> 02:11:24,674
when Lynn was,

5162
02:11:25,720 --> 02:11:26,780
he was those guys who was,

5163
02:11:26,810 --> 02:11:27,643
who was,

5164
02:11:27,950 --> 02:11:29,210
could beat anybody.

5165
02:11:29,870 --> 02:11:31,700
But man,

5166
02:11:31,701 --> 02:11:33,950
his style was just never fan friendly.

5167
02:11:34,240 --> 02:11:34,850
Yeah.

5168
02:11:34,850 --> 02:11:35,750
Madelyn's never,

5169
02:11:37,040 --> 02:11:38,240
well I don't know.

5170
02:11:38,300 --> 02:11:39,620
You know that fan friendly thing,

5171
02:11:39,621 --> 02:11:41,060
they say that about aspirin to,

5172
02:11:41,390 --> 02:11:42,170
to me,

5173
02:11:42,170 --> 02:11:43,010
if you're a fan,

5174
02:11:43,011 --> 02:11:44,780
you gotta be fascinated by everything.

5175
02:11:44,990 --> 02:11:46,560
I'm fascinated that I appreciate him.

5176
02:11:46,580 --> 02:11:48,650
He could take Douglas
Lema down a rag doll.

5177
02:11:48,651 --> 02:11:49,610
I'm like that's all it is.

5178
02:11:49,690 --> 02:11:50,523
I might cut the leave.

5179
02:11:50,720 --> 02:11:52,480
Fuck what am I looking?

5180
02:11:52,760 --> 02:11:53,750
I couldn't believe it.

5181
02:11:53,870 --> 02:11:55,520
I'm a fan of that man.

5182
02:11:55,521 --> 02:11:56,390
I'm a fan of that.

5183
02:11:56,391 --> 02:11:58,750
You can't say that's not
fan friendly cause I,

5184
02:11:59,060 --> 02:12:03,440
I was really bummed out when the
asker in UFC thing didn't work out.

5185
02:12:03,650 --> 02:12:06,440
And when take Dana White
said that ambient takes,

5186
02:12:09,910 --> 02:12:12,310
oh I disagree.

5187
02:12:12,311 --> 02:12:13,660
I think we have,

5188
02:12:13,970 --> 02:12:16,340
in order for a title to be legitimate,

5189
02:12:16,640 --> 02:12:21,620
you have to see how a champion stands
up to any and all challenges that are

5190
02:12:21,621 --> 02:12:22,454
effective.

5191
02:12:22,520 --> 02:12:26,240
And just because it's not fan friendly
doesn't mean it's not effective.

5192
02:12:26,270 --> 02:12:27,350
If it's effective,

5193
02:12:27,470 --> 02:12:27,901
if the,

5194
02:12:27,901 --> 02:12:29,960
the better guys going to fucking win,

5195
02:12:30,110 --> 02:12:31,910
you got to let him
fight any way they want.

5196
02:12:32,210 --> 02:12:33,350
The problem is,

5197
02:12:33,410 --> 02:12:33,641
and,

5198
02:12:33,641 --> 02:12:36,860
and guys like us are the
hardcore fans of sport.

5199
02:12:37,290 --> 02:12:38,123
Um,

5200
02:12:38,580 --> 02:12:38,661
well,

5201
02:12:38,661 --> 02:12:42,120
it's hard for hardcore fans to understand
is we aren't the target market.

5202
02:12:42,630 --> 02:12:47,630
Everybody wants it on the mom and pop's
of the world watching MMA and we aren't,

5203
02:12:48,240 --> 02:12:48,481
you know,

5204
02:12:48,481 --> 02:12:48,661
the,

5205
02:12:48,661 --> 02:12:48,891
the,

5206
02:12:48,891 --> 02:12:50,370
the hawkers and I said to me all the time,

5207
02:12:50,371 --> 02:12:50,730
like,

5208
02:12:50,730 --> 02:12:51,630
you don't appreciate this.

5209
02:12:51,631 --> 02:12:52,221
I'm hardcore fan.

5210
02:12:52,221 --> 02:12:55,300
It's like they're not after
you thereafter the radio,

5211
02:12:55,330 --> 02:12:56,140
Joe there,

5212
02:12:56,140 --> 02:12:57,360
they already have you.

5213
02:12:57,930 --> 02:13:01,820
No one's trying to get Jimmy Smith
and Joe Rogan to watch him and me.

5214
02:13:01,821 --> 02:13:02,730
We're going to watch it anyway.

5215
02:13:02,760 --> 02:13:02,911
Yeah,

5216
02:13:02,911 --> 02:13:03,750
we're doing this for free.

5217
02:13:03,760 --> 02:13:04,710
Doing this for 40.

5218
02:13:05,190 --> 02:13:08,550
I'm on vacation watching
MMA with Joe [inaudible].

5219
02:13:08,600 --> 02:13:09,630
Got To make me do it.

5220
02:13:09,660 --> 02:13:11,100
Oh my Soki just tagged him.

5221
02:13:11,120 --> 02:13:12,330
The top right hand moves.

5222
02:13:12,331 --> 02:13:15,210
So He's been hitting them with some high
kicks over and over again just into the

5223
02:13:15,211 --> 02:13:16,044
forearms.

5224
02:13:16,200 --> 02:13:17,970
But you both know,

5225
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:18,540
man,

5226
02:13:18,540 --> 02:13:22,570
forearms are not designed to
take fucking hard Molokai knots.

5227
02:13:23,180 --> 02:13:24,120
Take a bat and swing that.

5228
02:13:24,121 --> 02:13:26,940
My people will see it at home though.

5229
02:13:26,941 --> 02:13:27,181
They go,

5230
02:13:27,181 --> 02:13:27,301
oh,

5231
02:13:27,301 --> 02:13:28,020
I blocked that.

5232
02:13:28,020 --> 02:13:28,621
No,

5233
02:13:28,621 --> 02:13:29,454
he's hurt.

5234
02:13:29,700 --> 02:13:30,570
Like that shit hurts.

5235
02:13:30,571 --> 02:13:31,430
Like that's one.

5236
02:13:31,440 --> 02:13:32,010
I think I kicked so

5237
02:13:32,010 --> 02:13:33,870
much and it keeps you from punching.

5238
02:13:33,880 --> 02:13:35,790
Your arms are fucked up for a while.

5239
02:13:36,060 --> 02:13:37,230
Like for a few seconds.

5240
02:13:37,231 --> 02:13:39,870
You don't want to throw a punch with
that arm cause he's not feeling so good.

5241
02:13:39,920 --> 02:13:40,071
Hey,

5242
02:13:40,071 --> 02:13:40,671
don't want to punch.

5243
02:13:40,671 --> 02:13:41,451
He didn't want to move.

5244
02:13:41,451 --> 02:13:42,320
You don't want to move your leg.

5245
02:13:42,350 --> 02:13:44,720
Robbie Lawler and
Ellenberger right off the bat

5246
02:13:44,760 --> 02:13:46,950
makes him check three or
four of those with the,

5247
02:13:46,980 --> 02:13:47,970
with the forearms,

5248
02:13:48,150 --> 02:13:49,020
he blocks him.

5249
02:13:49,021 --> 02:13:53,820
But God Damn Lala was slamming those
in and that's did fucks your arms up.

5250
02:13:54,190 --> 02:13:54,461
I see.

5251
02:13:54,461 --> 02:13:58,520
Muy Thai fighters man laying in the
stories about bathtubs full of ice.

5252
02:13:58,521 --> 02:14:00,250
So like he came and you
came and move at the end.

5253
02:14:00,840 --> 02:14:02,800
Well and those are the
ones that you blocked.

5254
02:14:03,170 --> 02:14:04,003
I talked to.

5255
02:14:04,270 --> 02:14:07,210
Do you remember there was a dude
named Shuki who used to be a trainer,

5256
02:14:07,211 --> 02:14:09,360
it Magiro gym and he
worked with Stan longe.

5257
02:14:09,361 --> 02:14:13,140
Anitas remember when Stan the man long
Janita as he broke Dennis Alexios leg.

5258
02:14:13,141 --> 02:14:16,530
And the first thing I will add kick
Stan had ridiculous power in his leg.

5259
02:14:16,531 --> 02:14:17,600
Kicks and shook.

5260
02:14:17,601 --> 02:14:19,230
He used to hold pads for him.

5261
02:14:19,410 --> 02:14:20,243
And he was,

5262
02:14:20,380 --> 02:14:24,210
he had to get a hip replacement
because of holding pads for Stan Lodge.

5263
02:14:24,211 --> 02:14:28,650
Anitas hold that leg pad on the leg and
he would just take them on the hip bone.

5264
02:14:28,830 --> 02:14:29,550
Boom.

5265
02:14:29,550 --> 02:14:30,750
One of getting a hip replacement.

5266
02:14:30,900 --> 02:14:31,760
Look at Miss Soki.

5267
02:14:31,830 --> 02:14:35,280
Me Mom was hokey and Calvin
are in an epic fucking battle.

5268
02:14:37,220 --> 02:14:38,060
Kevin's a piece,

5269
02:14:38,061 --> 02:14:38,894
dude.

5270
02:14:38,990 --> 02:14:41,030
I was so impressed when
he beat Uriah Hall.

5271
02:14:41,540 --> 02:14:42,373
Yeah.

5272
02:14:42,710 --> 02:14:43,341
How much did you miss?

5273
02:14:43,341 --> 02:14:44,174
Wait by on this one.

5274
02:14:44,240 --> 02:14:44,990
Two pounds.

5275
02:14:44,990 --> 02:14:45,823
Two pounds.

5276
02:14:45,830 --> 02:14:46,370
Yeah.

5277
02:14:46,370 --> 02:14:47,300
Looking for guillotine.

5278
02:14:47,720 --> 02:14:49,220
Oh Nice.

5279
02:14:49,221 --> 02:14:50,054
Okay.

5280
02:14:50,480 --> 02:14:52,070
Where's miss okay from Sweden.

5281
02:14:53,060 --> 02:14:54,230
Huge wrestling background.

5282
02:14:54,231 --> 02:14:55,064
Not

5283
02:14:56,320 --> 02:14:57,290
Late Calvin.

5284
02:14:57,650 --> 02:14:58,640
He's got his back.

5285
02:14:58,780 --> 02:15:01,880
So he's gotta be thinking the Kelvins
fucking worn out from that weight cut.

5286
02:15:02,300 --> 02:15:03,010
That might be one.

5287
02:15:03,010 --> 02:15:03,711
The monomer lie.

5288
02:15:03,711 --> 02:15:04,041
Yeah,

5289
02:15:04,041 --> 02:15:05,570
he's pushing such a hard pace.

5290
02:15:06,020 --> 02:15:11,020
Cause Calvin barely made weight on the
undercard of the Johnny Sanchez or Johnny

5291
02:15:11,600 --> 02:15:13,250
Hendricks fight that Johnny Hendricks,

5292
02:15:13,251 --> 02:15:14,150
Robbie Lawler fight.

5293
02:15:14,330 --> 02:15:16,760
He was one of the ones that
also struggled to make weight.

5294
02:15:16,820 --> 02:15:17,810
Barely made it.

5295
02:15:17,811 --> 02:15:18,620
But again,

5296
02:15:18,620 --> 02:15:20,660
looked like he was on
fucking death's door.

5297
02:15:20,900 --> 02:15:22,250
And that was back in Dallas.

5298
02:15:23,430 --> 02:15:23,930
Okay.

5299
02:15:23,930 --> 02:15:25,190
And when you think about,

5300
02:15:25,840 --> 02:15:26,900
if you're not around the fight world,

5301
02:15:26,901 --> 02:15:27,201
the whole lot,

5302
02:15:27,201 --> 02:15:31,280
if you think about everything
you're losing for that two pounds,

5303
02:15:31,760 --> 02:15:34,160
that should be an indication
about physically hard.

5304
02:15:34,250 --> 02:15:36,340
What you've gone through that
you're like two pounds amount.

5305
02:15:36,380 --> 02:15:36,680
Yeah.

5306
02:15:36,680 --> 02:15:38,120
I just want 80% of his person,

5307
02:15:38,130 --> 02:15:41,660
20% of your fucking purse
to walk away and just got,

5308
02:15:41,661 --> 02:15:42,441
I just can't do that.

5309
02:15:42,441 --> 02:15:43,430
And it goes to your opponent.

5310
02:15:43,680 --> 02:15:45,420
That fucking sucks.

5311
02:15:45,421 --> 02:15:47,300
It goes to the guy who's
beating your ass right now.

5312
02:15:47,780 --> 02:15:50,900
It's just imagine how hard those
last 10 pounds where they were awful.

5313
02:15:50,960 --> 02:15:51,793
Yeah.

5314
02:15:52,980 --> 02:15:53,813
Good control.

5315
02:15:53,830 --> 02:15:54,700
Both hooks in man.

5316
02:15:54,701 --> 02:15:55,660
Real good control.

5317
02:16:00,460 --> 02:16:00,761
Yeah.

5318
02:16:00,761 --> 02:16:01,360
Calvin,

5319
02:16:01,360 --> 02:16:05,710
who knows how he's feeling right now
is if he actually missed the weight and

5320
02:16:05,711 --> 02:16:06,544
just gave up,

5321
02:16:06,760 --> 02:16:08,590
he must have been really fucking hurting.

5322
02:16:08,620 --> 02:16:08,771
Yeah.

5323
02:16:08,771 --> 02:16:09,161
Really.

5324
02:16:09,161 --> 02:16:12,610
Try and look at that fight night
avail of the Donald Serone,

5325
02:16:12,611 --> 02:16:13,211
Jim Miller.

5326
02:16:13,211 --> 02:16:14,110
That fights coming up.

5327
02:16:14,200 --> 02:16:15,033
It's gonna be good.

5328
02:16:15,610 --> 02:16:17,410
That's another one that
makes my hands sweaty.

5329
02:16:21,110 --> 02:16:21,943
Nico's uh,

5330
02:16:22,010 --> 02:16:22,581
like I said,

5331
02:16:22,581 --> 02:16:23,900
he's from Sweden,

5332
02:16:24,260 --> 02:16:25,850
one of Gustafson's buddies.

5333
02:16:27,910 --> 02:16:29,020
He's very well rounded,

5334
02:16:30,460 --> 02:16:33,850
super aggressive to what do
they start with over there?

5335
02:16:33,851 --> 02:16:34,684
Martial art lives,

5336
02:16:34,870 --> 02:16:35,860
I think get my main,

5337
02:16:35,890 --> 02:16:36,581
I mean I don't,

5338
02:16:36,581 --> 02:16:37,990
I don't think they have like,

5339
02:16:38,170 --> 02:16:41,080
I mean I'm sure they have karate schools
and I'm sure they have some white tie,

5340
02:16:41,350 --> 02:16:41,920
but they're just,

5341
02:16:41,920 --> 02:16:42,640
they're not,

5342
02:16:42,640 --> 02:16:45,730
they don't have a wrestling background
and their educational system.

5343
02:16:46,180 --> 02:16:47,013
No.

5344
02:16:47,320 --> 02:16:51,340
I tried to explain to somebody in the
MSN on air to belts are one time I said

5345
02:16:51,540 --> 02:16:52,030
America,

5346
02:16:52,030 --> 02:16:53,800
it's generally wrestling Europe,

5347
02:16:53,801 --> 02:16:54,660
they like kickboxing.

5348
02:16:54,880 --> 02:16:55,840
Brazil is Jujitsu.

5349
02:16:55,841 --> 02:16:56,740
That's generally the base.

5350
02:16:56,741 --> 02:16:58,390
People start out with Europe.

5351
02:16:58,600 --> 02:17:00,080
Kickboxing can make a living at it,

5352
02:17:00,150 --> 02:17:00,801
have slam.

5353
02:17:00,801 --> 02:17:02,440
They have a lot of good
promotions out there.

5354
02:17:02,770 --> 02:17:05,200
Generally if they're from Europe
kickboxing's where they start out.

5355
02:17:05,980 --> 02:17:06,813
Um,

5356
02:17:07,590 --> 02:17:08,423
yeah.

5357
02:17:09,030 --> 02:17:11,480
Great job with that left
butterfly keeping old.

5358
02:17:11,540 --> 02:17:14,970
Calvin's turns him over and he's
on top 15 seconds to go though.

5359
02:17:14,971 --> 02:17:15,840
You got to do some damage.

5360
02:17:15,841 --> 02:17:16,680
You want to win this round?

5361
02:17:17,940 --> 02:17:19,290
You can't just let them hold on to you.

5362
02:17:20,550 --> 02:17:21,240
Okay.

5363
02:17:21,240 --> 02:17:21,730
Huh.

5364
02:17:21,730 --> 02:17:22,563
And he will,

5365
02:17:24,160 --> 02:17:24,993
yeah.

5366
02:17:26,030 --> 02:17:27,770
Calvin's not getting anything off here.

5367
02:17:28,190 --> 02:17:28,401
Oh,

5368
02:17:28,401 --> 02:17:28,780
good.

5369
02:17:28,780 --> 02:17:30,290
Righthand Nice,

5370
02:17:30,650 --> 02:17:31,700
Nice Punch at the bell.

5371
02:17:31,730 --> 02:17:32,563
Yeah.

5372
02:17:32,660 --> 02:17:32,871
Yeah.

5373
02:17:32,871 --> 02:17:33,710
Europe generally.

5374
02:17:33,950 --> 02:17:34,520
Sambo.

5375
02:17:34,520 --> 02:17:34,821
Man.

5376
02:17:34,821 --> 02:17:38,570
It's amazing how many Samo
guys are fucking starting
to trickle into MMA now and

5377
02:17:38,571 --> 02:17:39,404
just dominate.

5378
02:17:39,770 --> 02:17:41,770
Does Russians or the Dagestani?

5379
02:17:41,910 --> 02:17:42,381
Yeah,

5380
02:17:42,381 --> 02:17:43,840
the Pakistani man.

5381
02:17:44,090 --> 02:17:45,940
Frightening place.

5382
02:17:46,170 --> 02:17:47,003
Fuck.

5383
02:17:47,900 --> 02:17:50,750
That is a hard place with charred men.

5384
02:17:51,110 --> 02:17:51,943
Uh,

5385
02:17:52,220 --> 02:17:52,580
okay.

5386
02:17:52,580 --> 02:17:53,310
When shallot,

5387
02:17:53,310 --> 02:17:56,450
some live was going to fart fight
pattern for the belt packer and goes,

5388
02:17:57,080 --> 02:17:57,441
hey man,

5389
02:17:57,441 --> 02:17:57,950
you know someone's,

5390
02:17:57,950 --> 02:17:58,161
you know,

5391
02:17:58,161 --> 02:17:59,600
they have to kill me
to take this belt away.

5392
02:17:59,601 --> 02:18:00,410
And he looked right at him and goes to,

5393
02:18:00,410 --> 02:18:01,243
sure.

5394
02:18:01,250 --> 02:18:02,120
I'm from Dagestan.

5395
02:18:02,850 --> 02:18:03,060
I,

5396
02:18:03,060 --> 02:18:03,920
it was hilarious.

5397
02:18:03,921 --> 02:18:04,550
It was like,

5398
02:18:04,550 --> 02:18:05,810
I forget what it was while doing what?

5399
02:18:05,811 --> 02:18:06,270
They were tired.

5400
02:18:06,270 --> 02:18:06,730
He goes,

5401
02:18:06,730 --> 02:18:06,970
you know,

5402
02:18:06,970 --> 02:18:08,420
soon as I have to kill me to take my belt,

5403
02:18:08,421 --> 02:18:09,380
like the general American,

5404
02:18:09,890 --> 02:18:10,550
he goes,

5405
02:18:10,550 --> 02:18:12,140
sure docusign.

5406
02:18:12,141 --> 02:18:12,951
It happens all the time.

5407
02:18:12,951 --> 02:18:13,191
You know what?

5408
02:18:13,191 --> 02:18:14,930
I made some joke about you
don't know where I'm from,

5409
02:18:14,931 --> 02:18:15,350
Bro.

5410
02:18:15,350 --> 02:18:15,790
Yeah.

5411
02:18:15,790 --> 02:18:17,780
Kill somebody for
something that nothing new.

5412
02:18:17,790 --> 02:18:19,010
That was some scary shit.

5413
02:18:19,040 --> 02:18:19,880
That's the ultimate.

5414
02:18:19,881 --> 02:18:20,720
You don't know where I'm fine.

5415
02:18:20,721 --> 02:18:21,630
You don't know where I'm from,

5416
02:18:21,631 --> 02:18:21,861
man.

5417
02:18:21,861 --> 02:18:25,070
From one of the worst places
on earth to grow up and live.

5418
02:18:25,280 --> 02:18:25,750
Yeah.

5419
02:18:25,750 --> 02:18:26,001
I mean,

5420
02:18:26,001 --> 02:18:27,350
you could live in Africa,

5421
02:18:27,560 --> 02:18:29,990
in the jungle with leopards and shit.

5422
02:18:29,991 --> 02:18:30,824
I'll probably be worse.

5423
02:18:33,640 --> 02:18:34,473
Yeah.

5424
02:18:34,520 --> 02:18:35,353
Have you seen the,

5425
02:18:35,450 --> 02:18:38,150
every guy they interviewed was
like head fucking cauliflower ear.

5426
02:18:38,320 --> 02:18:38,490
Yeah.

5427
02:18:38,490 --> 02:18:38,720
Like,

5428
02:18:38,720 --> 02:18:39,553
and the guy was like,

5429
02:18:39,560 --> 02:18:39,921
he's like,

5430
02:18:39,921 --> 02:18:41,030
it's not that we're terrorist.

5431
02:18:41,031 --> 02:18:41,864
He's like,

5432
02:18:41,900 --> 02:18:42,950
you killed my brother.

5433
02:18:43,490 --> 02:18:44,181
You killed my brother.

5434
02:18:44,181 --> 02:18:45,140
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

5435
02:18:45,620 --> 02:18:47,090
And he hadn't fucking gnarly ears.

5436
02:18:47,091 --> 02:18:47,790
I was like,

5437
02:18:47,790 --> 02:18:48,623
oh,

5438
02:18:48,830 --> 02:18:49,670
that's what you're doing.

5439
02:18:50,060 --> 02:18:51,710
You're pissing off a
country full of wrestlers.

5440
02:18:51,760 --> 02:18:52,580
Yeah.

5441
02:18:52,580 --> 02:18:53,413
Kelvinn looks so good.

5442
02:18:53,430 --> 02:18:54,160
Good eyes fee.

5443
02:18:54,160 --> 02:18:55,380
So light on his feet.

5444
02:18:57,090 --> 02:18:57,690
And that's like,

5445
02:18:57,690 --> 02:19:00,720
that's something that he started
getting after the ultimate fighter.

5446
02:19:00,930 --> 02:19:01,231
But again,

5447
02:19:01,231 --> 02:19:06,231
we Soki keeps landing that right kick
over and over and over again into the sun.

5448
02:19:07,020 --> 02:19:07,441
Oh,

5449
02:19:07,441 --> 02:19:09,120
Calvin with a good straight laughed.

5450
02:19:09,930 --> 02:19:10,411
Oh,

5451
02:19:10,411 --> 02:19:11,280
good combination.

5452
02:19:11,281 --> 02:19:11,491
Right.

5453
02:19:11,491 --> 02:19:13,350
Hook in a straight where number cut.

5454
02:19:13,740 --> 02:19:14,011
You know,

5455
02:19:14,011 --> 02:19:17,310
I think Calvin thinks he hurt
Nico at the end of that round.

5456
02:19:17,340 --> 02:19:19,650
Those couple of shots
jumping on and landed.

5457
02:19:19,651 --> 02:19:19,920
Yeah.

5458
02:19:19,920 --> 02:19:21,000
Good kick to the body.

5459
02:19:21,210 --> 02:19:21,871
Oh fuck.

5460
02:19:21,871 --> 02:19:22,770
He's all over him.

5461
02:19:22,870 --> 02:19:23,790
Got to get off the fence.

5462
02:19:23,820 --> 02:19:26,070
Promise he's going against
the fences feeder squaring up.

5463
02:19:26,250 --> 02:19:27,920
Calvin is a fucking man.

5464
02:19:28,160 --> 02:19:29,180
That's a tough kid.

5465
02:19:30,740 --> 02:19:31,580
It's just for me,

5466
02:19:31,581 --> 02:19:34,220
it's a matter of him being
healthy at this weight.

5467
02:19:34,700 --> 02:19:35,720
I think he can't do it.

5468
02:19:35,721 --> 02:19:37,190
If he uses a guy like dolce,

5469
02:19:37,310 --> 02:19:39,170
he's got a diabetic because you
can just look at it and be like,

5470
02:19:39,171 --> 02:19:39,501
yeah,

5471
02:19:39,501 --> 02:19:39,920
he could.

5472
02:19:39,920 --> 02:19:40,830
He could lose some pounds.

5473
02:19:41,480 --> 02:19:42,770
I see a good five,

5474
02:19:42,771 --> 02:19:43,604
six pounds.

5475
02:19:43,770 --> 02:19:44,300
Yeah.

5476
02:19:44,300 --> 02:19:45,920
He just get with dolce bro.

5477
02:19:45,950 --> 02:19:46,783
Pay Him the money.

5478
02:19:46,850 --> 02:19:47,450
It's not,

5479
02:19:47,450 --> 02:19:49,280
it ain't 20% okay.

5480
02:19:49,990 --> 02:19:52,340
We lost 20% of your purse pay.

5481
02:19:52,341 --> 02:19:54,530
Daltry he knows his shit.

5482
02:19:54,770 --> 02:19:55,460
Yeah.

5483
02:19:55,460 --> 02:19:56,450
He gets everybody on weight,

5484
02:19:56,540 --> 02:19:58,040
everybody and they look great.

5485
02:19:58,100 --> 02:19:59,210
How about Tiago Elvis?

5486
02:19:59,211 --> 02:20:04,211
He had Tiago Alva as 170 pounds a day
before the weigh in and looked at smaller

5487
02:20:04,521 --> 02:20:06,080
like look like you lost
a little bit of muscle,

5488
02:20:06,081 --> 02:20:06,570
but man,

5489
02:20:06,570 --> 02:20:08,210
well rate gas tank moved.

5490
02:20:08,211 --> 02:20:10,010
Well and that's the difference.

5491
02:20:10,011 --> 02:20:10,640
It's like,

5492
02:20:10,640 --> 02:20:14,300
do you want to go Tyron Woodley where
you're so big that you know you're super

5493
02:20:14,301 --> 02:20:16,130
explosive for like a minute and a half,

5494
02:20:16,190 --> 02:20:16,731
two minutes,

5495
02:20:16,731 --> 02:20:17,564
three minutes?

5496
02:20:17,900 --> 02:20:19,130
I think psychologically,

5497
02:20:19,131 --> 02:20:20,090
a lot of times for fighters,

5498
02:20:20,120 --> 02:20:23,810
it's kind of a security blanket to be
big and swole and they don't feel that

5499
02:20:23,840 --> 02:20:25,070
there'll be able to win without it.

5500
02:20:25,071 --> 02:20:26,120
It's more like I,

5501
02:20:26,121 --> 02:20:27,470
the confidence of being the bigger,

5502
02:20:27,471 --> 02:20:28,101
stronger guy,

5503
02:20:28,101 --> 02:20:30,140
but it's not worth the
trade off a lot of times.

5504
02:20:30,470 --> 02:20:31,310
It's not where it really is.

5505
02:20:31,311 --> 02:20:33,770
Losing your gas is the
scariest thing ever.

5506
02:20:33,800 --> 02:20:33,981
Oh,

5507
02:20:33,981 --> 02:20:34,641
that's the worst.

5508
02:20:34,641 --> 02:20:36,170
Another person trying
to beat you to death,

5509
02:20:36,370 --> 02:20:37,040
I'm tired.

5510
02:20:37,040 --> 02:20:38,090
Beat you to death.

5511
02:20:38,340 --> 02:20:40,070
Like there wasn't a reference there.

5512
02:20:40,071 --> 02:20:41,210
That person could kill you.

5513
02:20:41,240 --> 02:20:41,600
Yeah,

5514
02:20:41,600 --> 02:20:42,241
exactly.

5515
02:20:42,241 --> 02:20:43,280
Dolan was save him.

5516
02:20:43,430 --> 02:20:43,851
There's a,

5517
02:20:43,851 --> 02:20:46,670
there's a great story of George Foreman,

5518
02:20:46,850 --> 02:20:49,970
Muhammad Ali when they were
fighting and Zaire and it's like,

5519
02:20:49,971 --> 02:20:50,181
you know,

5520
02:20:50,181 --> 02:20:51,140
the seventh or eighth round,

5521
02:20:51,141 --> 02:20:51,980
it's almost over,

5522
02:20:52,160 --> 02:20:52,461
and he goes,

5523
02:20:52,461 --> 02:20:53,181
I had nothing left,

5524
02:20:53,181 --> 02:20:53,481
and he goes,

5525
02:20:53,481 --> 02:20:55,490
I hit Ali with a good one,

5526
02:20:55,520 --> 02:20:56,630
a good body shot,

5527
02:20:56,780 --> 02:20:57,560
and I heard them go,

5528
02:20:57,560 --> 02:20:58,400
is that all you got?

5529
02:20:58,970 --> 02:21:00,110
And I remember thinking,

5530
02:21:00,470 --> 02:21:00,801
yeah,

5531
02:21:00,801 --> 02:21:01,634
that's about it.

5532
02:21:02,930 --> 02:21:05,360
That moment of going all right as,

5533
02:21:05,740 --> 02:21:06,050
ah,

5534
02:21:06,050 --> 02:21:06,530
fuck,

5535
02:21:06,530 --> 02:21:07,341
I'm out of gas.

5536
02:21:07,341 --> 02:21:09,620
That's the worst fuel
Kelvin's all over him again.

5537
02:21:09,650 --> 02:21:12,050
Beautiful combination knee.

5538
02:21:12,080 --> 02:21:13,190
He hit him with an elbow,

5539
02:21:13,310 --> 02:21:15,020
caught him on the elbow
with that foot though.

5540
02:21:15,021 --> 02:21:15,854
They'll have a hurt.

5541
02:21:17,090 --> 02:21:17,301
Oh,

5542
02:21:17,301 --> 02:21:18,740
another one took a body kick.

5543
02:21:20,750 --> 02:21:25,370
Good blocking to Kelvin has improved so
much and change so much in the way he

5544
02:21:25,371 --> 02:21:26,204
moves.

5545
02:21:26,210 --> 02:21:26,811
That's Oh,

5546
02:21:26,811 --> 02:21:27,291
nice.

5547
02:21:27,291 --> 02:21:29,540
Step off to the side and throw
that left kick to the body.

5548
02:21:29,590 --> 02:21:30,261
Foot works good.

5549
02:21:30,261 --> 02:21:31,970
That's what's setting everything up is he?

5550
02:21:31,990 --> 02:21:32,310
He's,

5551
02:21:32,310 --> 02:21:34,250
he's cutting enough angles
that he can't see it coming.

5552
02:21:34,370 --> 02:21:36,020
He's also light on his feet,

5553
02:21:36,021 --> 02:21:37,760
which is a rarity in MMA.

5554
02:21:37,761 --> 02:21:41,780
That's a really important thing to have
that mobility that you see so often in

5555
02:21:41,781 --> 02:21:44,450
boxing and karate and a
lot of other martial arts,

5556
02:21:44,451 --> 02:21:45,470
but in MMA,

5557
02:21:45,471 --> 02:21:49,790
so many guys are trying to like Moy
Tai it stand flat foot or wrestling

5558
02:21:49,791 --> 02:21:51,050
wrestling's very flat footed.

5559
02:21:51,080 --> 02:21:51,913
Yup.

5560
02:21:52,100 --> 02:21:52,290
Yeah.

5561
02:21:52,290 --> 02:21:52,440
The,

5562
02:21:52,440 --> 02:21:55,040
the accuracy rate on a 100% punches.

5563
02:21:55,100 --> 02:21:56,820
So slammed comparative.

5564
02:21:56,840 --> 02:21:58,300
You land for 50% chance.

5565
02:21:58,301 --> 02:21:58,600
Yeah.

5566
02:21:58,600 --> 02:21:59,240
Yeah.

5567
02:21:59,240 --> 02:22:00,530
He gets someone wobbled.

5568
02:22:01,130 --> 02:22:01,431
Yeah.

5569
02:22:01,431 --> 02:22:04,820
And the foot work that you're able to
achieve by being light on your feet.

5570
02:22:04,820 --> 02:22:09,820
Like the Tj Dillashaw Hanan Barao fight
were so light on his feet that Hennen

5571
02:22:09,860 --> 02:22:13,490
Browne never had a stationary
target to load up on all this.

5572
02:22:13,550 --> 02:22:14,780
This spinning kicks.

5573
02:22:14,781 --> 02:22:17,000
He was always the same side.

5574
02:22:17,001 --> 02:22:17,300
Yup.

5575
02:22:17,300 --> 02:22:19,290
He was always pivot on the
same side and he was falling.

5576
02:22:19,340 --> 02:22:21,050
I'm like an elevator door or like a,

5577
02:22:21,051 --> 02:22:23,180
I'm one of those revolving doors.

5578
02:22:23,181 --> 02:22:23,390
Yeah.

5579
02:22:23,390 --> 02:22:24,223
Just get in it.

5580
02:22:24,600 --> 02:22:25,433
Follow the door.

5581
02:22:26,460 --> 02:22:27,870
Calvin's all over him.

5582
02:22:27,871 --> 02:22:28,140
Now.

5583
02:22:28,140 --> 02:22:29,820
This is all about him
off the fence either.

5584
02:22:31,020 --> 02:22:32,820
This is the Kelvin Gasol him round man.

5585
02:22:32,821 --> 02:22:34,290
He's put a beating on Nico,

5586
02:22:34,500 --> 02:22:35,700
so put to rest.

5587
02:22:35,701 --> 02:22:37,680
Any thoughts about him
being completely diminished?

5588
02:22:37,681 --> 02:22:38,101
By the way?

5589
02:22:38,101 --> 02:22:38,934
Cut.

5590
02:22:39,870 --> 02:22:43,920
He's obviously got a lot in his
fucking tank man and Nico's exhausted.

5591
02:22:46,920 --> 02:22:47,731
It's getting broken into.

5592
02:22:47,731 --> 02:22:48,980
That's the thing that,

5593
02:22:49,360 --> 02:22:49,640
you know,

5594
02:22:49,640 --> 02:22:51,710
they used to not test for EPO,

5595
02:22:51,890 --> 02:22:54,380
which is kind of hilarious because boxing,

5596
02:22:54,440 --> 02:22:55,580
the boxing commission,

5597
02:22:55,610 --> 02:22:58,010
they would say that boxing
is not an endurance sport,

5598
02:22:58,340 --> 02:22:59,740
so you don't have to test for EPO.

5599
02:23:00,040 --> 02:23:00,570
Yeah.

5600
02:23:00,570 --> 02:23:04,250
Having never imagined spoken like
someone who's never done it before.

5601
02:23:04,330 --> 02:23:08,680
There's that dumb and they're a part
of the commission that's judging.

5602
02:23:08,700 --> 02:23:09,140
Yeah.

5603
02:23:09,140 --> 02:23:11,360
What gets passed and tested for,

5604
02:23:11,361 --> 02:23:14,660
and maybe it was like EPO is
too expensive to test for EPO.

5605
02:23:14,690 --> 02:23:19,010
They developed a test and I want to
say 2000 for Epo for the first time.

5606
02:23:20,490 --> 02:23:21,323
Uh,

5607
02:23:21,630 --> 02:23:23,900
that's what Lance
Armstrong was doping with.

5608
02:23:23,910 --> 02:23:25,210
Shane Mosley plop for it,

5609
02:23:25,211 --> 02:23:25,390
man.

5610
02:23:25,390 --> 02:23:26,330
Moses got popcorn.

5611
02:23:26,430 --> 02:23:26,731
Yeah.

5612
02:23:26,731 --> 02:23:29,330
They've found some old
blood of his and I'm like,

5613
02:23:29,340 --> 02:23:29,641
Hey,

5614
02:23:29,641 --> 02:23:31,350
let's give this a shot.

5615
02:23:32,230 --> 02:23:32,460
Oh,

5616
02:23:32,460 --> 02:23:33,330
it looks like a,

5617
02:23:33,970 --> 02:23:35,100
you got some weird blood dude.

5618
02:23:36,420 --> 02:23:39,570
It's 50% more blood cells
in a normal person's blood.

5619
02:23:39,610 --> 02:23:40,140
Hmm.

5620
02:23:40,140 --> 02:23:40,973
How weird.

5621
02:23:41,340 --> 02:23:42,870
This has turned out to
be a good fight though.

5622
02:23:42,900 --> 02:23:43,733
Very good.

5623
02:23:44,610 --> 02:23:44,911
Yeah.

5624
02:23:44,911 --> 02:23:46,170
I don't know what they're gonna do.

5625
02:23:46,220 --> 02:23:46,650
Um,

5626
02:23:46,650 --> 02:23:50,340
if they do wind up tests and everybody
and they find out that the roster just

5627
02:23:50,341 --> 02:23:52,620
overrun with people
that are on everything.

5628
02:23:52,870 --> 02:23:53,703
Yeah.

5629
02:23:53,870 --> 02:23:54,120
You know,

5630
02:23:54,120 --> 02:23:54,720
if they can,

5631
02:23:54,720 --> 02:23:56,190
if they can test.

5632
02:23:56,191 --> 02:23:57,750
You said there's too many people in MMA.

5633
02:23:59,060 --> 02:24:01,390
I didn't really say good
way to call the herd.

5634
02:24:01,391 --> 02:24:02,660
My friend was asking,

5635
02:24:03,340 --> 02:24:04,173
I was asking

5636
02:24:05,740 --> 02:24:06,221
what do you,

5637
02:24:06,221 --> 02:24:07,054
uh,

5638
02:24:07,330 --> 02:24:07,870
I mean,

5639
02:24:07,870 --> 02:24:08,710
what do they do?

5640
02:24:08,740 --> 02:24:09,041
What do they,

5641
02:24:09,041 --> 02:24:12,550
what do they do if they find out like
60% of the people that cut 60% of the

5642
02:24:12,551 --> 02:24:13,361
Bible now,

5643
02:24:13,361 --> 02:24:15,100
how if they start

5644
02:24:15,430 --> 02:24:16,263
this procedure,

5645
02:24:16,390 --> 02:24:17,260
how long does it take to get there?

5646
02:24:17,261 --> 02:24:17,800
Your system?

5647
02:24:17,800 --> 02:24:18,581
Like how long will they,

5648
02:24:18,581 --> 02:24:19,414
it's a good question.

5649
02:24:19,420 --> 02:24:22,920
That's the question is if everybody cut
now someone's already got to figure it

5650
02:24:22,921 --> 02:24:23,651
out too late.

5651
02:24:23,651 --> 02:24:23,951
Yeah.

5652
02:24:23,951 --> 02:24:27,400
I mean there's some fucking guy
out there that knows his shit,

5653
02:24:27,820 --> 02:24:28,181
you know,

5654
02:24:28,181 --> 02:24:30,980
and it's like as listen to the ball.

5655
02:24:30,981 --> 02:24:31,250
Okay.

5656
02:24:31,250 --> 02:24:32,083
I talk about it.

5657
02:24:32,260 --> 02:24:34,810
There's always someone a step
ahead because someone's got to,

5658
02:24:34,960 --> 02:24:38,410
someone's still got to sell that
shit and figure everything out.

5659
02:24:38,411 --> 02:24:38,741
So it's,

5660
02:24:38,741 --> 02:24:39,120
it's,

5661
02:24:39,120 --> 02:24:39,350
you know,

5662
02:24:39,350 --> 02:24:40,240
like a guarantee.

5663
02:24:40,241 --> 02:24:41,550
Everything's already been

5664
02:24:41,920 --> 02:24:42,850
very well planned.

5665
02:24:43,030 --> 02:24:43,691
I wonder,

5666
02:24:43,691 --> 02:24:47,870
I wonder if there's a new thing that they
can take now that you can't test for.

5667
02:24:48,090 --> 02:24:49,680
Lopers are always ahead of the system.

5668
02:24:50,100 --> 02:24:50,701
They have to be,

5669
02:24:50,701 --> 02:24:50,880
I mean,

5670
02:24:50,880 --> 02:24:51,930
by definition there,

5671
02:24:51,931 --> 02:24:54,030
because people have to do things.

5672
02:24:54,060 --> 02:24:57,660
That is the system that is
the system is people do stuff,

5673
02:24:57,990 --> 02:24:58,501
they do stuff,

5674
02:24:58,501 --> 02:25:00,900
it's illegal and the the testers
figure it out and catch them,

5675
02:25:00,901 --> 02:25:02,610
but they're always lagging behind.

5676
02:25:03,060 --> 02:25:03,550
You know,

5677
02:25:03,550 --> 02:25:05,250
it was originally made EPO for,

5678
02:25:05,251 --> 02:25:09,000
for leukemia patients that would have
trouble keeping the red blood cell count

5679
02:25:09,001 --> 02:25:09,530
up.

5680
02:25:09,530 --> 02:25:13,620
So never occurred to them that somebody
would take that in order to help their

5681
02:25:13,621 --> 02:25:14,190
endurance.

5682
02:25:14,190 --> 02:25:16,950
And then they started taking it
now that'd make a test for it.

5683
02:25:16,951 --> 02:25:18,360
So that's the cycle.

5684
02:25:18,361 --> 02:25:21,510
They make it for something
and then someone figures
out how to cheat with it and

5685
02:25:21,511 --> 02:25:22,530
then they figure out how to catch him.

5686
02:25:22,960 --> 02:25:26,260
The catchers are the people who are trying
to catch the people are always at the

5687
02:25:26,261 --> 02:25:27,340
end of the process.

5688
02:25:27,650 --> 02:25:30,380
I'm ignorant as to how it's all done.

5689
02:25:30,381 --> 02:25:32,240
So I don't know whether or not,

5690
02:25:32,241 --> 02:25:33,380
this is a stupid question,

5691
02:25:33,560 --> 02:25:38,120
but is there like a point in time
where they run out of things?

5692
02:25:38,121 --> 02:25:38,530
There's,

5693
02:25:38,530 --> 02:25:42,710
there's no more things that you could
add to the human body that they haven't

5694
02:25:42,740 --> 02:25:43,850
already discovered.

5695
02:25:44,060 --> 02:25:47,790
So there's no more things that you could
add that they can't test for like that.

5696
02:25:47,900 --> 02:25:48,980
The clear stuff.

5697
02:25:49,190 --> 02:25:51,770
Part of w we had that guy on the podcast,

5698
02:25:51,771 --> 02:25:52,550
Victor Conte,

5699
02:25:52,550 --> 02:25:54,470
and he was talking about
the whole ball call scandal.

5700
02:25:54,710 --> 02:25:58,850
And what I found really interesting about
it was that he just had altered some

5701
02:25:58,851 --> 02:26:02,210
stuff and made it so it was not
within their testing parameters,

5702
02:26:02,211 --> 02:26:03,080
but still effective.

5703
02:26:03,081 --> 02:26:03,500
Yeah.

5704
02:26:03,500 --> 02:26:04,580
At a certain point in time.

5705
02:26:04,581 --> 02:26:06,830
Did they run out of those variations?

5706
02:26:07,550 --> 02:26:08,080
I don't know.

5707
02:26:08,080 --> 02:26:08,650
I don't,

5708
02:26:08,650 --> 02:26:10,750
I find it hard to believe.

5709
02:26:10,990 --> 02:26:11,823
Um,

5710
02:26:13,150 --> 02:26:13,690
uh,

5711
02:26:13,690 --> 02:26:18,010
McKell Ferrara who was McKella Ferrari
was a doctor who dealt with Lance

5712
02:26:18,010 --> 02:26:21,070
Armstrong and helped him through
his tour de France wins of course,

5713
02:26:21,220 --> 02:26:21,641
helped him.

5714
02:26:21,641 --> 02:26:23,530
Dope was asked one time,

5715
02:26:23,531 --> 02:26:25,910
have we seen the limits
of human endurance,

5716
02:26:25,911 --> 02:26:28,180
of the capacity for human endurance?

5717
02:26:28,510 --> 02:26:30,010
And he turned to the guy
and he laughed and goes,

5718
02:26:30,160 --> 02:26:31,150
we're nowhere near it.

5719
02:26:32,340 --> 02:26:33,131
So I mean,

5720
02:26:33,131 --> 02:26:35,620
they're always going to come up
with something because it's just,

5721
02:26:35,860 --> 02:26:36,693
it's going to be,

5722
02:26:37,580 --> 02:26:41,870
what I hear though is genetic engineering
and I hear things like mio step,

5723
02:26:41,920 --> 02:26:42,730
whoa,

5724
02:26:42,730 --> 02:26:42,951
hi,

5725
02:26:42,951 --> 02:26:45,200
kick myostatin inhibitors and all the,

5726
02:26:45,201 --> 02:26:48,170
all the different shit that they're
inevitably going to come up with down the

5727
02:26:48,171 --> 02:26:48,680
pipe.

5728
02:26:48,680 --> 02:26:52,610
But I wonder if like they're going to
be able to come up with new steroids

5729
02:26:52,790 --> 02:26:56,090
because I think genetic engineering
is a completely different ballgame.

5730
02:26:56,160 --> 02:26:56,791
Completely different.

5731
02:26:56,791 --> 02:26:57,140
But,

5732
02:26:57,140 --> 02:26:57,650
but no.

5733
02:26:57,650 --> 02:26:58,351
Also think about it.

5734
02:26:58,351 --> 02:26:58,590
I mean,

5735
02:26:58,590 --> 02:26:59,820
will there be a cure for cancer?

5736
02:27:00,420 --> 02:27:00,661
Yeah.

5737
02:27:00,661 --> 02:27:01,231
We can sit her and go,

5738
02:27:01,231 --> 02:27:01,381
yeah.

5739
02:27:01,381 --> 02:27:01,800
Eventually.

5740
02:27:01,800 --> 02:27:03,480
[inaudible] so they got
to come up with something,

5741
02:27:03,690 --> 02:27:03,970
right?

5742
02:27:03,970 --> 02:27:05,760
It's like saying whether
it be new stories.

5743
02:27:05,761 --> 02:27:06,001
Well,

5744
02:27:06,001 --> 02:27:08,130
will there be new medical
advances for other things?

5745
02:27:08,131 --> 02:27:08,760
Yeah.

5746
02:27:08,760 --> 02:27:11,160
Then they're going to be new
ways to improve the human body.

5747
02:27:11,700 --> 02:27:16,410
And I think we'll be playing this
game probably the rest of our lives.

5748
02:27:16,411 --> 02:27:16,800
Yeah.

5749
02:27:16,800 --> 02:27:17,431
I wonder,

5750
02:27:17,431 --> 02:27:20,610
I wonder they have robots doing this shit
until it's like the Fox intro in real

5751
02:27:20,611 --> 02:27:20,970
life.

5752
02:27:20,970 --> 02:27:24,240
Like fuck fucking robot.

5753
02:27:25,290 --> 02:27:25,651
Uh,

5754
02:27:25,651 --> 02:27:25,861
no,

5755
02:27:25,861 --> 02:27:27,510
you do had to bring that up.

5756
02:27:27,660 --> 02:27:32,350
I hate those fucking robot goofy
picking up robots and slam.

5757
02:27:32,351 --> 02:27:32,800
And I'm like,

5758
02:27:32,800 --> 02:27:34,770
what looks like a transformers commercial?

5759
02:27:34,800 --> 02:27:34,931
Well,

5760
02:27:34,931 --> 02:27:35,461
that movie,

5761
02:27:35,461 --> 02:27:36,430
remember that Mighty

5762
02:27:37,960 --> 02:27:38,793
uh,

5763
02:27:39,430 --> 02:27:40,263
Wolverine Guy,

5764
02:27:40,750 --> 02:27:41,870
Jack Knew Jackman.

5765
02:27:42,240 --> 02:27:44,430
There was robot fighters.

5766
02:27:47,580 --> 02:27:49,330
Woo fucking funded that movement.

5767
02:27:49,980 --> 02:27:51,360
That shit is so terrible.

5768
02:27:51,510 --> 02:27:52,140
Oh,

5769
02:27:52,140 --> 02:27:53,820
Calvin threw a kick in the slip.

5770
02:27:54,440 --> 02:27:55,610
Been in this fucking octagon,

5771
02:27:55,611 --> 02:27:55,791
man,

5772
02:27:55,791 --> 02:27:56,870
especially with logos.

5773
02:27:57,410 --> 02:28:00,530
Do you find a difference in certain
logos being more slippery than others?

5774
02:28:00,880 --> 02:28:01,041
Uh,

5775
02:28:01,041 --> 02:28:01,690
yeah.

5776
02:28:01,690 --> 02:28:02,000
Yeah,

5777
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:03,110
it's different surface.

5778
02:28:03,170 --> 02:28:05,190
But I mean you're,

5779
02:28:05,240 --> 02:28:06,073
you,

5780
02:28:06,250 --> 02:28:09,140
I get this weird heightened sensation
in my feet when I'm out there and moving

5781
02:28:09,160 --> 02:28:10,400
and like I,

5782
02:28:10,410 --> 02:28:12,100
if I just step on that canvas,

5783
02:28:12,101 --> 02:28:12,460
I'm like,

5784
02:28:12,460 --> 02:28:13,293
oh,

5785
02:28:13,630 --> 02:28:13,871
okay.

5786
02:28:13,871 --> 02:28:14,950
I got Boehner in my feet,

5787
02:28:15,390 --> 02:28:18,130
get all tingling and I'm just
dancing and I just feel this.

5788
02:28:18,940 --> 02:28:19,773
It's,

5789
02:28:19,850 --> 02:28:20,621
it's a weird,

5790
02:28:20,621 --> 02:28:20,891
but yeah,

5791
02:28:20,891 --> 02:28:22,140
you do feel a

5792
02:28:22,280 --> 02:28:22,640
definite,

5793
02:28:22,640 --> 02:28:25,310
especially if it was blood on it and
blood is the body's best lubricant,

5794
02:28:25,370 --> 02:28:25,581
you know,

5795
02:28:25,581 --> 02:28:27,050
like that's the fucking,

5796
02:28:27,080 --> 02:28:28,400
that shit gets on something

5797
02:28:30,110 --> 02:28:30,943
very slippery.

5798
02:28:31,790 --> 02:28:34,220
It's why it's interesting
when guys get caught,

5799
02:28:34,221 --> 02:28:35,810
it actually makes them easier to choke.

5800
02:28:36,200 --> 02:28:36,740
Can wait,

5801
02:28:36,740 --> 02:28:38,600
slide things under their chin easier.

5802
02:28:40,750 --> 02:28:42,100
This a good fucking fight.

5803
02:28:42,101 --> 02:28:43,480
Calvin's come on strong.

5804
02:28:43,481 --> 02:28:44,380
Nice body shots.

5805
02:28:44,490 --> 02:28:45,160
Ooh.

5806
02:28:45,160 --> 02:28:46,810
Whipped that right hand to the body.

5807
02:28:49,680 --> 02:28:50,360
Okay.

5808
02:28:50,360 --> 02:28:51,930
And that's what I mean guys cooked,

5809
02:28:51,940 --> 02:28:54,650
they make these horrible
cuts and they perform great.

5810
02:28:54,680 --> 02:28:55,400
It's just,

5811
02:28:55,400 --> 02:28:56,980
I mean it's just hard to say,

5812
02:28:57,030 --> 02:28:57,863
come on motherfucker.

5813
02:28:58,310 --> 02:28:59,570
He's got a brown great.

5814
02:28:59,571 --> 02:29:00,830
His back's up against wall.

5815
02:29:00,831 --> 02:29:03,260
The UFC fucking hates it when guys miss.

5816
02:29:03,261 --> 02:29:03,950
Wait,

5817
02:29:03,950 --> 02:29:04,311
every,

5818
02:29:04,311 --> 02:29:05,480
I mean Belterra it's it too.

5819
02:29:05,481 --> 02:29:06,990
This is third.

5820
02:29:06,991 --> 02:29:07,730
They hate it.

5821
02:29:07,730 --> 02:29:09,740
I don't think he missed
weight last time he made it.

5822
02:29:09,741 --> 02:29:11,210
He just needed a second attempt.

5823
02:29:11,870 --> 02:29:12,021
No,

5824
02:29:12,021 --> 02:29:13,430
I know he did and that was there.

5825
02:29:13,650 --> 02:29:13,980
Uh,

5826
02:29:13,980 --> 02:29:15,590
but this is his first.

5827
02:29:16,730 --> 02:29:21,170
We fought at one 85 on the show and
so he's fighting at one 70 here.

5828
02:29:21,380 --> 02:29:23,630
He's a one 71 70,

5829
02:29:23,631 --> 02:29:24,770
but he's got to do it more,

5830
02:29:25,130 --> 02:29:27,380
more correctly and more
with more discipline.

5831
02:29:27,410 --> 02:29:27,651
Oh,

5832
02:29:27,651 --> 02:29:28,340
high kick.

5833
02:29:28,340 --> 02:29:29,720
But he's still a bad mother fucker.

5834
02:29:29,721 --> 02:29:30,091
Dude.

5835
02:29:30,091 --> 02:29:33,830
Is those two high kicks in a row suite
and he still has good footwork for the

5836
02:29:33,831 --> 02:29:35,150
beginning of fight to
the end of the fight.

5837
02:29:35,150 --> 02:29:35,690
Good footwork.

5838
02:29:35,690 --> 02:29:36,523
Very good.

5839
02:29:36,620 --> 02:29:37,070
Yeah.

5840
02:29:37,070 --> 02:29:38,030
Light on his feet.

5841
02:29:38,060 --> 02:29:39,920
He's keep racking that thing.

5842
02:29:39,930 --> 02:29:40,170
Yeah.

5843
02:29:40,170 --> 02:29:40,910
Woo.

5844
02:29:40,910 --> 02:29:42,740
And they were exchanging
them back and forth.

5845
02:29:42,741 --> 02:29:43,790
Something big and fighting.

5846
02:29:43,791 --> 02:29:44,511
Don't set a pace.

5847
02:29:44,511 --> 02:29:47,240
You can't keep something in the first
round you can't do in the third round.

5848
02:29:47,480 --> 02:29:47,920
Great.

5849
02:29:47,920 --> 02:29:49,040
He kept it up all three rounds.

5850
02:29:49,041 --> 02:29:49,370
Yeah,

5851
02:29:49,370 --> 02:29:49,821
he did.

5852
02:29:49,821 --> 02:29:51,110
And Move Soki didn't.

5853
02:29:51,800 --> 02:29:53,030
Interesting fight man.

5854
02:29:53,210 --> 02:29:53,931
Interesting fight.

5855
02:29:53,931 --> 02:29:54,800
I wonder who got that.

5856
02:29:55,130 --> 02:29:56,540
I think that that's the one
thing that goes through my head.

5857
02:29:56,541 --> 02:29:58,880
The most of the fight
is don't stop moving.

5858
02:29:59,300 --> 02:29:59,870
Stop moving.

5859
02:29:59,870 --> 02:30:00,703
Don't stop moving.

5860
02:30:00,800 --> 02:30:01,191
I kicked,

5861
02:30:01,191 --> 02:30:03,110
I landed 43 lake kicks I think.

5862
02:30:03,140 --> 02:30:03,921
I think a area,

5863
02:30:03,921 --> 02:30:04,191
hold on.

5864
02:30:04,191 --> 02:30:06,590
He said my last fight that was just legs.

5865
02:30:06,591 --> 02:30:10,030
I kicked him in the body and the head
a little bit but I mean Atlanta at 43 I

5866
02:30:10,031 --> 02:30:11,040
and the whole time I was just going

5867
02:30:13,200 --> 02:30:13,640
good.

5868
02:30:13,640 --> 02:30:15,840
I think I landed one every 20
seconds they broke it down.

5869
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:18,230
I was always thinking if I'm
hitting him he's not hitting me.

5870
02:30:18,290 --> 02:30:18,590
Yeah.

5871
02:30:18,590 --> 02:30:20,240
Like if I just keep hitting him,

5872
02:30:20,450 --> 02:30:22,010
make him miss to make a mess,

5873
02:30:22,011 --> 02:30:22,420
man.

5874
02:30:22,420 --> 02:30:22,980
That's awesome.

5875
02:30:22,980 --> 02:30:23,720
Keep it up.

5876
02:30:23,720 --> 02:30:24,553
It's just to keep,

5877
02:30:24,680 --> 02:30:26,530
keep doing the angles and footwork.

5878
02:30:26,750 --> 02:30:27,120
What,

5879
02:30:27,120 --> 02:30:31,040
what is the best thing for
strength and conditioning for that?

5880
02:30:31,130 --> 02:30:32,210
Is there any one thing,

5881
02:30:32,211 --> 02:30:37,211
is it fight training or is strength and
conditioning like just as important as

5882
02:30:37,851 --> 02:30:41,570
fight training when it comes to that with
the way the athletes are in this sport

5883
02:30:41,571 --> 02:30:42,470
now it's strength.

5884
02:30:42,471 --> 02:30:43,550
Conditioning is huge.

5885
02:30:43,730 --> 02:30:44,563
And I mean we just,

5886
02:30:44,570 --> 02:30:47,180
we just kind of started
putting it out on the Internet.

5887
02:30:47,330 --> 02:30:48,163
Um,

5888
02:30:48,860 --> 02:30:50,540
maybe these 50 gallon barrels,

5889
02:30:50,910 --> 02:30:51,091
you know,

5890
02:30:51,091 --> 02:30:51,210
I,

5891
02:30:51,210 --> 02:30:51,501
my,

5892
02:30:51,501 --> 02:30:53,540
my coach Corey Beasley at
fight came conditioning.

5893
02:30:54,470 --> 02:30:55,700
You know who John Brookfield is?

5894
02:30:56,570 --> 02:30:57,960
He's the guy who started the,

5895
02:30:57,980 --> 02:31:01,760
the ropes and the towels and all the shit
and he started listing strongest grip.

5896
02:31:01,760 --> 02:31:04,280
He's just some little Walrus
who's pulls trucks and shit,

5897
02:31:04,980 --> 02:31:05,813
you know,

5898
02:31:05,900 --> 02:31:07,040
but he's kind of given this,

5899
02:31:07,041 --> 02:31:07,940
given this barrel idea,

5900
02:31:07,941 --> 02:31:12,941
the Corey and you put 500 pounds of sand
in a big plastic barrel and you push

5901
02:31:13,101 --> 02:31:15,410
and push and pull and kind of roll it.

5902
02:31:15,411 --> 02:31:16,520
You can check it out on my Instagram.

5903
02:31:16,960 --> 02:31:17,171
Um,

5904
02:31:17,171 --> 02:31:19,040
uncle creepy MMA and you just,

5905
02:31:19,290 --> 02:31:19,501
you know,

5906
02:31:19,501 --> 02:31:21,780
you just roll this thing
back and forth and it's,

5907
02:31:21,781 --> 02:31:22,840
it's fucking it.

5908
02:31:23,040 --> 02:31:25,110
I've never had something made
me so strong in my entire life,

5909
02:31:25,111 --> 02:31:25,351
but I mean,

5910
02:31:25,351 --> 02:31:26,820
obviously besides wrestling,

5911
02:31:26,850 --> 02:31:27,683
but

5912
02:31:28,710 --> 02:31:29,070
there's no,

5913
02:31:29,070 --> 02:31:29,611
you can't,

5914
02:31:29,611 --> 02:31:30,444
you can't,

5915
02:31:31,380 --> 02:31:33,210
you can't not have the training drilling.

5916
02:31:33,211 --> 02:31:35,400
You have to Joe something 10 that
you want to mass master anything.

5917
02:31:35,401 --> 02:31:36,720
You have to drill it for 10,000 hours.

5918
02:31:36,810 --> 02:31:37,530
It's true.

5919
02:31:37,530 --> 02:31:40,530
You know you have to do everything and
we've got so much shit to try and master

5920
02:31:40,531 --> 02:31:41,340
that.

5921
02:31:41,340 --> 02:31:42,870
But that sounds crazy.

5922
02:31:42,950 --> 02:31:43,331
So you're,

5923
02:31:43,331 --> 02:31:47,850
you're grabbing this giant barrel and
what are you specifically trying to do

5924
02:31:47,851 --> 02:31:48,684
with it?

5925
02:31:49,020 --> 02:31:50,250
Think about from a clinch,

5926
02:31:50,280 --> 02:31:51,960
you know how like Johnny
Hendricks huge though,

5927
02:31:51,961 --> 02:31:52,201
right?

5928
02:31:52,201 --> 02:31:53,610
Can you even get your arms around it?

5929
02:31:54,300 --> 02:31:55,290
There's a top on it.

5930
02:31:55,380 --> 02:31:55,920
Okay.

5931
02:31:55,920 --> 02:31:57,030
And then you sit there and you,

5932
02:31:57,150 --> 02:31:59,130
you grab it and you grab
it here and you twist it.

5933
02:31:59,250 --> 02:32:02,640
So you've got 500 pounds that you're
twisting back and forth or you're pushing

5934
02:32:02,810 --> 02:32:05,790
and pulling in all the muscles
throughout the whole part of it are,

5935
02:32:06,720 --> 02:32:08,160
I mean the first couple
of times you do it,

5936
02:32:08,161 --> 02:32:08,401
you're like,

5937
02:32:08,401 --> 02:32:09,240
Holy Shit.

5938
02:32:09,241 --> 02:32:09,720
Wow.

5939
02:32:09,720 --> 02:32:11,460
I don't think I've ever
used these muscles before.

5940
02:32:12,300 --> 02:32:13,021
Let me pull it up for you.

5941
02:32:13,021 --> 02:32:13,740
It's fucking,

5942
02:32:13,740 --> 02:32:14,640
I'm trying to find it.

5943
02:32:14,641 --> 02:32:15,840

02:32:15,841 --> 02:32:16,210

5945
02:32:16,210 --> 02:32:18,120

5946
02:32:18,180 --> 02:32:21,680

5949
02:32:23,630 --> 02:32:23,930
I was like,

5950
02:32:23,930 --> 02:32:26,280
you got a cool picture of your
daughter getting into the cryo thing.

5951
02:32:26,281 --> 02:32:27,114
That's,

5952
02:32:28,650 --> 02:32:29,130
you got it.

5953
02:32:29,130 --> 02:32:29,341

5954
02:32:29,341 --> 02:32:30,180

5958
02:32:37,760 --> 02:32:41,010
And so that's 500 fucking pounds.

5959
02:32:41,011 --> 02:32:41,221
Yeah,

5960
02:32:41,221 --> 02:32:41,971
that's the sand.

5961
02:32:41,971 --> 02:32:42,990
There's one of water too.

5962
02:32:42,991 --> 02:32:43,970
That's um,

5963
02:32:44,160 --> 02:32:45,140

5965
02:32:45,660 --> 02:32:46,900
Where's the videos routine?

5966
02:32:47,290 --> 02:32:48,390
It's a little bit down.

5967
02:32:48,420 --> 02:32:49,253
How far?

5968
02:32:49,500 --> 02:32:50,670
How long ago did you put it up?

5969
02:32:50,850 --> 02:32:51,570
A couple of weeks.

5970
02:32:51,570 --> 02:32:52,403
Couple of weeks ago.

5971
02:32:52,570 --> 02:32:54,630
You a daily Instagrammer guy?

5972
02:32:54,810 --> 02:32:55,111
Yeah,

5973
02:32:55,111 --> 02:32:56,130

5974
02:32:56,530 --> 02:32:57,820

messages all the time and I,

5987
02:33:10,680 --> 02:33:12,690
So I have a real hard
time keeping up this,

5988
02:33:12,691 --> 02:33:13,081

5989
02:33:13,081 --> 02:33:14,070

It's giving me some would bro.

5991
02:33:15,020 --> 02:33:15,870
I'm not gonna lie about it.

5992
02:33:16,110 --> 02:33:16,943
Like not,

5993
02:33:16,980 --> 02:33:17,371
not even,

5994
02:33:17,371 --> 02:33:17,521
I mean,

5995
02:33:17,521 --> 02:33:18,210
that's,

5996
02:33:18,210 --> 02:33:19,043
you know,

5997
02:33:19,590 --> 02:33:21,540
granted my girlfriend only
weighs like 95 pounds.

5998
02:33:21,541 --> 02:33:21,961
I get out,

5999
02:33:21,961 --> 02:33:22,350
Jo,

6000
02:33:22,350 --> 02:33:23,760
I'm passing the word
on to you and you said,

6001
02:33:23,820 --> 02:33:24,481
yeah,

6002
02:33:24,481 --> 02:33:25,314
go ahead.

6003
02:33:25,520 --> 02:33:26,880
Interest man would though split.

6004
02:33:26,881 --> 02:33:27,481
She was not gay.

6005
02:33:27,481 --> 02:33:28,314
It's totally different.

6006
02:33:30,240 --> 02:33:32,750
So this is just a sequence
that you go through.

6007
02:33:32,770 --> 02:33:33,120
Wow.

6008
02:33:33,120 --> 02:33:36,420
This hip escape thing that you're
doing with the weight on you.

6009
02:33:36,421 --> 02:33:37,320
How much weight is that?

6010
02:33:37,350 --> 02:33:38,183
I don't know.

6011
02:33:38,730 --> 02:33:39,541
It looks like a lot of weight.

6012
02:33:39,541 --> 02:33:40,374
You gotta I dunno.

6013
02:33:42,390 --> 02:33:43,170
It looks like,

6014
02:33:43,170 --> 02:33:43,291
oh,

6015
02:33:43,291 --> 02:33:43,741
it's up there.

6016
02:33:43,741 --> 02:33:44,071
I fuck,

6017
02:33:44,071 --> 02:33:44,550
I don't know.

6018
02:33:44,550 --> 02:33:45,383
It's a lot of weight.

6019
02:33:45,870 --> 02:33:46,400
I'm Kinda,

6020
02:33:46,400 --> 02:33:46,740
I don't know.

6021
02:33:46,740 --> 02:33:47,610
I've gotten kind of strong.

6022
02:33:48,350 --> 02:33:48,660
I live,

6023
02:33:48,660 --> 02:33:49,680
I say like whatever.

6024
02:33:49,681 --> 02:33:50,514
I don't even know dude.

6025
02:33:50,610 --> 02:33:51,151
You could do it.

6026
02:33:51,151 --> 02:33:52,260
I don't even know Bro.

6027
02:33:52,290 --> 02:33:53,670
I've been working with
Kuwait for a long time.

6028
02:33:54,170 --> 02:33:55,003
He tells me what to do.

6029
02:33:55,040 --> 02:34:00,040
It looks like a 45 to 30 fives and a 25
what does that 41 to 41 45 in each size.

6030
02:34:02,310 --> 02:34:07,310
One 35 to two 35 hours or two is right
to 35 25 that's a lot of fucking weights

6031
02:34:09,211 --> 02:34:10,044
on.

6032
02:34:11,460 --> 02:34:12,091
That's a lot of weight.

6033
02:34:12,091 --> 02:34:13,620
And that's a normal limpic barbell,

6034
02:34:13,621 --> 02:34:13,920
right?

6035
02:34:13,920 --> 02:34:14,753
Yeah.

6036
02:34:14,880 --> 02:34:15,840
Jesus Christ kid.

6037
02:34:17,230 --> 02:34:18,100
That's gotta be really good

6038
02:34:18,100 --> 02:34:19,150
for your fucking back.

6039
02:34:19,420 --> 02:34:20,290
You're back in core.

6040
02:34:20,291 --> 02:34:21,640
Must be tremendously strong.

6041
02:34:21,641 --> 02:34:22,110
Yeah.

6042
02:34:22,110 --> 02:34:22,381
It's,

6043
02:34:22,381 --> 02:34:22,710
uh,

6044
02:34:22,710 --> 02:34:23,550
it's fun and it's,

6045
02:34:23,551 --> 02:34:23,731
you know,

6046
02:34:23,731 --> 02:34:24,021
it's,

6047
02:34:24,021 --> 02:34:25,230
it's something that we're trying to,

6048
02:34:25,350 --> 02:34:25,620
you know,

6049
02:34:25,620 --> 02:34:28,050
everyone's in the crossfit
and crossfit cool or whatever,

6050
02:34:28,080 --> 02:34:30,800
but what would his crossfits know?

6051
02:34:30,870 --> 02:34:33,760
Cross training across
different types of exercise.

6052
02:34:33,780 --> 02:34:34,260
Exactly.

6053
02:34:34,260 --> 02:34:34,531
It's,

6054
02:34:34,531 --> 02:34:34,741
you know,

6055
02:34:34,741 --> 02:34:38,430
it's what I like to do and I've gotten
good at it and we've kind of built the

6056
02:34:38,431 --> 02:34:39,360
system and,

6057
02:34:39,361 --> 02:34:40,140
um,

6058
02:34:40,140 --> 02:34:40,441
but yeah,

6059
02:34:40,441 --> 02:34:40,741
and again,

6060
02:34:40,741 --> 02:34:42,700
the barrels is the
toughest thing that I've,

6061
02:34:42,701 --> 02:34:44,100
I've never felt something
made me so strong.

6062
02:34:44,560 --> 02:34:45,040
Wild.

6063
02:34:45,040 --> 02:34:45,760
I love that,

6064
02:34:45,760 --> 02:34:47,650
that thing that you're doing
up there with the weight too,

6065
02:34:47,651 --> 02:34:49,540
because that lifting
the hips up like that,

6066
02:34:49,720 --> 02:34:50,553
first of all,

6067
02:34:51,130 --> 02:34:54,460
drastically increase your ability
to send it home on a check,

6068
02:34:55,090 --> 02:34:55,640
right?

6069
02:34:55,640 --> 02:34:56,200
Dude?

6070
02:34:56,200 --> 02:34:57,033
Yes.

6071
02:34:57,170 --> 02:34:58,310
Harder than uncle creepy.

6072
02:34:58,370 --> 02:34:59,090
Have you saw thinking,

6073
02:34:59,090 --> 02:34:59,661
have you seen it grow?

6074
02:34:59,661 --> 02:35:00,400
You see my girlfriend,

6075
02:35:00,400 --> 02:35:01,233
you got to send it in,

6076
02:35:01,950 --> 02:35:03,080
but gal happy.

6077
02:35:03,570 --> 02:35:03,691
Ooh,

6078
02:35:03,691 --> 02:35:05,280
look at this next cub Swanson.

6079
02:35:05,281 --> 02:35:05,911
Jeremy Stevens.

6080
02:35:05,911 --> 02:35:07,830
Five rounds to if it goes,

6081
02:35:07,900 --> 02:35:08,820
I think it'll go five rounds.

6082
02:35:10,150 --> 02:35:10,520
No,

6083
02:35:10,520 --> 02:35:11,170
I don't think so.

6084
02:35:11,170 --> 02:35:13,920
If I know Jeremy Stevens
rock in a crazy Amish beard,

6085
02:35:15,900 --> 02:35:16,410
uh,

6086
02:35:16,410 --> 02:35:16,940
yeah,

6087
02:35:16,940 --> 02:35:18,900
I probably won't go five rounds,

6088
02:35:19,170 --> 02:35:19,681
but that,

6089
02:35:19,681 --> 02:35:19,950
um,

6090
02:35:19,950 --> 02:35:22,970
that's gotta be tremendous for your
ground game when it comes to like hip

6091
02:35:22,971 --> 02:35:24,120
escapes and things like that,

6092
02:35:24,390 --> 02:35:28,080
to have that ability to pop
up off the strength of that.

6093
02:35:28,081 --> 02:35:28,914
It's amazing.

6094
02:35:29,310 --> 02:35:29,491
Yeah.

6095
02:35:29,491 --> 02:35:33,270
My fighting guys 125 pounds and you're
doing that with whatever the fuck that

6096
02:35:33,271 --> 02:35:33,571
was,

6097
02:35:33,571 --> 02:35:34,710
however much weight that was.

6098
02:35:34,711 --> 02:35:35,370
Yeah.

6099
02:35:35,370 --> 02:35:35,761
It was,

6100
02:35:35,761 --> 02:35:36,594
uh,

6101
02:35:36,840 --> 02:35:37,021
you know,

6102
02:35:37,021 --> 02:35:37,854
that's something that,

6103
02:35:37,860 --> 02:35:38,550
that actually we,

6104
02:35:38,550 --> 02:35:40,070
I was talking to my toe,

6105
02:35:40,071 --> 02:35:41,130
the anet guys about taking,

6106
02:35:41,131 --> 02:35:43,650
doing the takeover thing
and then trying to do,

6107
02:35:43,651 --> 02:35:44,680
instead of like cub did just,

6108
02:35:44,700 --> 02:35:45,181
just him,

6109
02:35:45,181 --> 02:35:47,760
I was thinking of doing me and strength
conditioning stuff because it's all,

6110
02:35:47,840 --> 02:35:49,080
it's on it kind of stuff.

6111
02:35:50,040 --> 02:35:50,221
But,

6112
02:35:50,221 --> 02:35:50,560
uh,

6113
02:35:50,560 --> 02:35:51,030
that's,

6114
02:35:51,030 --> 02:35:52,170
that's our new,

6115
02:35:52,900 --> 02:35:53,701
my thing.

6116
02:35:53,701 --> 02:35:54,000
We'd say,

6117
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:55,050
I just fight came conditioning.

6118
02:35:55,051 --> 02:35:55,211
It's,

6119
02:35:55,211 --> 02:35:56,250
it's fun and it's,

6120
02:35:56,340 --> 02:35:56,611
you know,

6121
02:35:56,611 --> 02:35:57,011
it actually,

6122
02:35:57,011 --> 02:35:57,181
we,

6123
02:35:57,181 --> 02:35:57,730
it,

6124
02:35:57,730 --> 02:35:58,531
it fucking works.

6125
02:35:58,531 --> 02:35:59,364
Obviously.

6126
02:35:59,450 --> 02:36:00,240
I,

6127
02:36:00,240 --> 02:36:00,570
you know,

6128
02:36:00,570 --> 02:36:00,720
I,

6129
02:36:00,720 --> 02:36:02,010
if someone weighs 125 pounds,

6130
02:36:02,011 --> 02:36:03,210
I'm gonna fucking sent him for a ride.

6131
02:36:04,090 --> 02:36:04,450
Yeah.

6132
02:36:04,450 --> 02:36:05,110
I mean,

6133
02:36:05,110 --> 02:36:08,230
I think what you had there was 325 pounds,

6134
02:36:08,270 --> 02:36:09,103
wasn't it?

6135
02:36:09,330 --> 02:36:10,163
I can text,

6136
02:36:10,170 --> 02:36:10,450
let's,

6137
02:36:10,450 --> 02:36:15,130
let's figure it out because it's one
45 plate on each side with an Olympic

6138
02:36:15,131 --> 02:36:17,200
barbell is 135 pounds.

6139
02:36:17,230 --> 02:36:17,520
Right?

6140
02:36:17,520 --> 02:36:17,980
Right.

6141
02:36:17,980 --> 02:36:20,500
And then you add to 30 fives on each side,

6142
02:36:20,501 --> 02:36:22,360
which is one 40 to that.

6143
02:36:22,540 --> 02:36:27,540
So you have two 75 and then you
have two 20 fives on that as well.

6144
02:36:28,570 --> 02:36:30,160
So that's another 50 pounds.

6145
02:36:30,180 --> 02:36:30,400
Yeah.

6146
02:36:30,400 --> 02:36:32,320
So that's 325 pounds.

6147
02:36:32,770 --> 02:36:33,940
That's fucking crazy.

6148
02:36:34,120 --> 02:36:36,640
That's a lot of God damn wait to fuck.

6149
02:36:37,420 --> 02:36:37,841
You know,

6150
02:36:37,841 --> 02:36:39,120
if you had a big girl on top of you,

6151
02:36:39,121 --> 02:36:39,410
she's like,

6152
02:36:39,410 --> 02:36:40,243
motherfucker,

6153
02:36:41,340 --> 02:36:42,490
you can't send it in

6154
02:36:45,280 --> 02:36:47,340
her up while you're
fucking from the bottom.

6155
02:36:47,370 --> 02:36:48,090
She'd be like,

6156
02:36:48,090 --> 02:36:48,511
damn,

6157
02:36:48,511 --> 02:36:49,201
that little white boy.

6158
02:36:49,201 --> 02:36:49,741
Fuck me.

6159
02:36:49,741 --> 02:36:50,340
Right.

6160
02:36:50,340 --> 02:36:50,790
I just,

6161
02:36:50,790 --> 02:36:51,960
I don't know why I made her a black chick.

6162
02:36:51,990 --> 02:36:53,760
I don't know why I just throw that big.

6163
02:36:53,761 --> 02:36:55,250
I just automatically think they're best.

6164
02:36:55,260 --> 02:36:56,093
What I think

6165
02:36:57,740 --> 02:36:58,920
I let my lecture all the work,

6166
02:36:58,921 --> 02:36:59,230
I don't know.

6167
02:36:59,230 --> 02:37:00,570
You guys didn't need all
these weights and shit.

6168
02:37:00,600 --> 02:37:00,891
Listen,

6169
02:37:00,891 --> 02:37:01,201
you know,

6170
02:37:01,201 --> 02:37:03,270
sometimes I don't what I'm saying.

6171
02:37:03,870 --> 02:37:04,770
I'm not all Dick.

6172
02:37:04,810 --> 02:37:05,270
I got,

6173
02:37:05,270 --> 02:37:06,090
I'm like,

6174
02:37:06,090 --> 02:37:06,923
I love

6175
02:37:08,510 --> 02:37:08,811
my Dick.

6176
02:37:08,811 --> 02:37:09,421
Do all the work.

6177
02:37:09,421 --> 02:37:10,740
I don't need his hip exercise shit.

6178
02:37:10,840 --> 02:37:13,110
A Cub Swanson has got one of the wildest,

6179
02:37:13,111 --> 02:37:13,420
most

6180
02:37:13,420 --> 02:37:17,090
unpredictable styles of his
fight with Dennis Seaver.

6181
02:37:17,320 --> 02:37:18,060
Yeah.

6182
02:37:18,060 --> 02:37:19,730
The last combination when he,

6183
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:20,990
when he had him hurt,

6184
02:37:21,140 --> 02:37:26,060
it was so fucking accurate
and just ridiculously wild.

6185
02:37:26,840 --> 02:37:27,800
Like real wild,

6186
02:37:27,801 --> 02:37:29,180
but super accurate.

6187
02:37:29,210 --> 02:37:29,990
Explosive Man.

6188
02:37:29,990 --> 02:37:31,670
He does all of his
strength and conditioning.

6189
02:37:31,671 --> 02:37:32,540
What balancing.

6190
02:37:32,780 --> 02:37:35,780
He'll do like weightlifting stuff
while he's standing on balls and stuff,

6191
02:37:35,810 --> 02:37:36,021
you know,

6192
02:37:36,021 --> 02:37:36,860
like those um,

6193
02:37:37,010 --> 02:37:37,843
those uh,

6194
02:37:38,320 --> 02:37:39,153
what are those balls?

6195
02:37:39,190 --> 02:37:40,550
This is called an a medicine ball.

6196
02:37:40,560 --> 02:37:42,420
No balance balls to the wall,

6197
02:37:42,470 --> 02:37:43,170
plyo balls,

6198
02:37:43,170 --> 02:37:44,003
whatever you call him.

6199
02:37:44,120 --> 02:37:45,470
But he does all that stuff.

6200
02:37:45,471 --> 02:37:48,200
Like a little stand on half
balls and do like kettle bells,

6201
02:37:48,201 --> 02:37:49,160
like everything he does,

6202
02:37:49,161 --> 02:37:50,180
he's doing with uh,

6203
02:37:50,210 --> 02:37:51,043
with balance.

6204
02:37:52,250 --> 02:37:52,611
Jeremy.

6205
02:37:52,611 --> 02:37:52,861
Steve.

6206
02:37:52,861 --> 02:37:53,870
It's a motherfucker though.

6207
02:37:53,871 --> 02:37:54,201
That kid,

6208
02:37:54,201 --> 02:37:56,300
he has heavy handed man.

6209
02:37:56,301 --> 02:37:57,260
He is hard.

6210
02:37:57,440 --> 02:37:58,160
He hits hard.

6211
02:37:58,160 --> 02:37:59,750
He hit artist as a lightweight,

6212
02:38:00,200 --> 02:38:00,681
as a one.

6213
02:38:00,681 --> 02:38:02,540
He kept all that power going to 45.

6214
02:38:02,540 --> 02:38:02,831
And that's,

6215
02:38:02,831 --> 02:38:03,710
that's a rare thing.

6216
02:38:04,070 --> 02:38:04,970
While he's healthy,

6217
02:38:04,971 --> 02:38:06,140
he's doing it real good.

6218
02:38:06,141 --> 02:38:08,610
Alliance is a serious
fucking team man and he,

6219
02:38:08,650 --> 02:38:11,000
he fucking knocks people
out over there all the time.

6220
02:38:11,001 --> 02:38:11,550
Does he really?

6221
02:38:11,550 --> 02:38:12,383
I mean he's,

6222
02:38:13,030 --> 02:38:13,750
he's,

6223
02:38:13,750 --> 02:38:14,410
he's,

6224
02:38:14,410 --> 02:38:16,160
he's a lot of fun to hang out with but he,

6225
02:38:16,170 --> 02:38:17,600
he's a fucking savage in the gym.

6226
02:38:17,720 --> 02:38:18,021
Yeah,

6227
02:38:18,021 --> 02:38:18,920
I would imagine.

6228
02:38:19,040 --> 02:38:20,450
He's an interesting guy to talk to.

6229
02:38:20,451 --> 02:38:21,380
I enjoyed talking to him.

6230
02:38:21,381 --> 02:38:22,071
Mark Smart Guy.

6231
02:38:22,071 --> 02:38:22,520
Yeah.

6232
02:38:22,520 --> 02:38:23,510
I had him on the podcast.

6233
02:38:23,511 --> 02:38:24,344
He was great.

6234
02:38:24,980 --> 02:38:25,491
He's a,

6235
02:38:25,491 --> 02:38:26,600
he's an interesting dude,

6236
02:38:26,990 --> 02:38:31,990
but his fucking power is redonkulous
but cub is to so awkward.

6237
02:38:32,180 --> 02:38:34,250
Kenny deal with the
angles and the explosive.

6238
02:38:34,251 --> 02:38:35,001
That's the question.

6239
02:38:35,001 --> 02:38:35,834
Yeah.

6240
02:38:36,710 --> 02:38:36,891
Yeah.

6241
02:38:36,891 --> 02:38:38,030
Tuck comes a wild man.

6242
02:38:38,540 --> 02:38:40,160
I would like to see where
you match your covers is,

6243
02:38:40,170 --> 02:38:40,790
although,

6244
02:38:40,790 --> 02:38:41,270
you know,

6245
02:38:41,270 --> 02:38:41,810
yeah,

6246
02:38:41,810 --> 02:38:43,070
I mean although caught him,

6247
02:38:43,370 --> 02:38:46,100
you can't blink to ill double flying me.

6248
02:38:47,030 --> 02:38:47,870
Jesus.

6249
02:38:47,871 --> 02:38:48,800
It is what it is.

6250
02:38:48,801 --> 02:38:49,071
You know,

6251
02:38:49,071 --> 02:38:49,910
you get hit with that.

6252
02:38:49,911 --> 02:38:50,600
That's a wrap.

6253
02:38:50,600 --> 02:38:51,920
Your head split open.

6254
02:38:52,160 --> 02:38:53,560
I mean he covered up immediately,

6255
02:38:53,570 --> 02:38:54,770
had a big ass scar,

6256
02:38:56,660 --> 02:38:59,180
but I would like to see what
would happen if that fight.

6257
02:38:59,210 --> 02:39:00,410
Well that was a different cub.

6258
02:39:00,411 --> 02:39:01,400
Swanson then too.

6259
02:39:01,880 --> 02:39:02,300
I mean,

6260
02:39:02,300 --> 02:39:04,430
although was at its peak then you still,

6261
02:39:04,460 --> 02:39:06,230
I don't think although
has diminished at all.

6262
02:39:06,890 --> 02:39:07,820
Everyone else has gotten better.

6263
02:39:07,850 --> 02:39:08,330
Yeah,

6264
02:39:08,330 --> 02:39:11,390
he's slowed down a little
bit and because he takes it,

6265
02:39:11,660 --> 02:39:14,780
he plays it a little bit more safe
because he's got so much to lose and he's

6266
02:39:14,781 --> 02:39:15,614
alone and he's bigger.

6267
02:39:15,980 --> 02:39:16,541
He's gotten very,

6268
02:39:16,541 --> 02:39:16,781
yeah,

6269
02:39:16,781 --> 02:39:17,330
it's a big,

6270
02:39:17,330 --> 02:39:21,770
I don't think the dude wants to go to
one 55 because if he goes to one 55 he's

6271
02:39:21,771 --> 02:39:24,350
not going to have his
title is title means a lot.

6272
02:39:24,570 --> 02:39:24,860
You know,

6273
02:39:24,860 --> 02:39:27,710
being a world champion means a lot
and as long as he can make the weight,

6274
02:39:27,711 --> 02:39:28,640
it's going to be real hard.

6275
02:39:28,820 --> 02:39:31,220
Unless they have like
some sort of a super fine.

6276
02:39:31,520 --> 02:39:31,701
Now,

6277
02:39:31,701 --> 02:39:34,610
if they had a super fight and it was,

6278
02:39:34,611 --> 02:39:36,070
if I went on this five pound champ,

6279
02:39:36,080 --> 02:39:36,351
I lose,

6280
02:39:36,351 --> 02:39:37,520
I'm still the 45 pound champ.

6281
02:39:37,521 --> 02:39:38,150
I think he'd take that.

6282
02:39:38,150 --> 02:39:38,660
Yes.

6283
02:39:38,660 --> 02:39:40,010
I think that's the way to do it.

6284
02:39:40,040 --> 02:39:41,420
I think that's the way to get them in.

6285
02:39:42,020 --> 02:39:45,260
But you know when a guy's
like a guy like Aldo man,

6286
02:39:45,261 --> 02:39:46,970
he's a fucking hero in Brazil.

6287
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:47,840
He's a hero.

6288
02:39:48,170 --> 02:39:53,170
He's a huge star and as a mixed martial
artist man to be a world champion is

6289
02:39:53,661 --> 02:39:54,494
where it's at.

6290
02:39:54,500 --> 02:39:54,890
Yeah,

6291
02:39:54,890 --> 02:39:56,600
he is a world fucking champion.

6292
02:39:57,160 --> 02:39:59,000
[inaudible] that's the one thing man,

6293
02:39:59,001 --> 02:40:00,410
that fucking weight cut.

6294
02:40:00,770 --> 02:40:01,430
He would,

6295
02:40:01,430 --> 02:40:01,641
he,

6296
02:40:01,641 --> 02:40:02,960
if he went 55 once,

6297
02:40:02,990 --> 02:40:04,580
I don't think he would go 55 again.

6298
02:40:04,760 --> 02:40:05,300
Really?

6299
02:40:05,300 --> 02:40:06,950
Cause I mean he just
seems like he just gets,

6300
02:40:07,190 --> 02:40:07,880
he,

6301
02:40:07,880 --> 02:40:08,900
he would put on too much,

6302
02:40:09,200 --> 02:40:12,080
too much weight and then it would
just be fucking death to get down.

6303
02:40:12,081 --> 02:40:14,070
But like it wasn't hard before.

6304
02:40:14,310 --> 02:40:16,980
Once you taste what it's
like to not cut that.

6305
02:40:17,040 --> 02:40:17,400
Yeah,

6306
02:40:17,400 --> 02:40:20,910
it's hard to get back down again if he
tasted what it's like to feel good when

6307
02:40:20,911 --> 02:40:22,080
you're actually inside.

6308
02:40:22,110 --> 02:40:22,530
Yeah.

6309
02:40:22,530 --> 02:40:23,460
It could be a good change.

6310
02:40:23,461 --> 02:40:23,970
You never know.

6311
02:40:23,970 --> 02:40:26,310
It could be because I think there's
a good chance against pedes.

6312
02:40:26,340 --> 02:40:27,810
I think he has a good
chance and that fire,

6313
02:40:28,890 --> 02:40:29,250
you know,

6314
02:40:29,250 --> 02:40:29,771
else has a good,

6315
02:40:29,771 --> 02:40:31,080
a chance to have fight pedis

6316
02:40:34,110 --> 02:40:35,030
pedis as a good job.

6317
02:40:35,050 --> 02:40:35,180
Why?

6318
02:40:35,180 --> 02:40:36,013
It's a great fight.

6319
02:40:36,220 --> 02:40:38,510
Although it goes up and gets Kol by Pedis,

6320
02:40:38,540 --> 02:40:38,881
you know,

6321
02:40:38,881 --> 02:40:41,010
but pedes said he could make one 45 man,

6322
02:40:41,640 --> 02:40:42,930
he said he could make it a pet.

6323
02:40:42,931 --> 02:40:44,140
This is not a huge 55.

6324
02:40:44,310 --> 02:40:44,760
No,

6325
02:40:44,760 --> 02:40:44,941
no.

6326
02:40:44,941 --> 02:40:46,530
He's not fucking slick man.

6327
02:40:46,531 --> 02:40:49,390
Jesus really good on the ground too.

6328
02:40:49,600 --> 02:40:53,400
That's what people sleep on when he
caught Henderson with that arm bar.

6329
02:40:53,550 --> 02:40:58,550
I mean that was a standard Bjj one o one
on bar in the middle there some quick

6330
02:40:59,080 --> 02:41:00,870
but done well done.

6331
02:41:00,870 --> 02:41:01,560
Perfectly.

6332
02:41:01,560 --> 02:41:02,550
Nice adjustment.

6333
02:41:02,760 --> 02:41:04,170
He changed the angle,

6334
02:41:04,450 --> 02:41:05,310
which is what a blue belt.

6335
02:41:05,370 --> 02:41:08,730
I think they were saying it's a
purple belt and it was just a,

6336
02:41:08,731 --> 02:41:11,760
it was a fucking basic drilled and yeah,

6337
02:41:11,780 --> 02:41:12,300
just,

6338
02:41:12,300 --> 02:41:13,590
it's why they do it that way.

6339
02:41:13,620 --> 02:41:14,210
Yeah.

6340
02:41:14,210 --> 02:41:14,910
It's like,

6341
02:41:14,910 --> 02:41:16,140
that's why we do it like that.

6342
02:41:16,510 --> 02:41:18,000
He's just fast as fuck man.

6343
02:41:18,001 --> 02:41:19,380
He's fast as fuck with everything.

6344
02:41:19,890 --> 02:41:24,890
But he tore his patella tendon and he
tours LCL and had it all stitched back up

6345
02:41:25,381 --> 02:41:25,771
and shit.

6346
02:41:25,771 --> 02:41:26,700
But you know,

6347
02:41:26,701 --> 02:41:29,340
that's why he's doing this
ultimate fighter with Gill.

6348
02:41:29,820 --> 02:41:30,653
It gives some time,

6349
02:41:31,050 --> 02:41:32,430
give us some time to heal,

6350
02:41:32,760 --> 02:41:34,230
get it all back in order.

6351
02:41:34,231 --> 02:41:34,711
And then,

6352
02:41:34,711 --> 02:41:34,980
uh,

6353
02:41:34,980 --> 02:41:36,870
eventually fight Melendez for the title,

6354
02:41:36,871 --> 02:41:38,670
which will be a very fun fight.

6355
02:41:38,700 --> 02:41:39,030
Yeah,

6356
02:41:39,030 --> 02:41:39,720
it's gonna be awesome.

6357
02:41:39,720 --> 02:41:41,160
Gilbert's a fucking beast.

6358
02:41:43,290 --> 02:41:43,650
But that,

6359
02:41:43,650 --> 02:41:44,100
that,

6360
02:41:44,100 --> 02:41:44,850
you know,

6361
02:41:44,850 --> 02:41:45,450
Gilbert,

6362
02:41:45,450 --> 02:41:47,550
that shows you how crazy he is.

6363
02:41:47,610 --> 02:41:50,790
Cause he could have fought
Diego Sanchez in a safe way.

6364
02:41:50,820 --> 02:41:51,120
Yeah.

6365
02:41:51,120 --> 02:41:54,760
He could've just kept Diego
at bay and to Mexicans.

6366
02:41:55,980 --> 02:41:56,813
Nope.

6367
02:41:56,910 --> 02:41:57,510
Nope.

6368
02:41:57,510 --> 02:41:57,871
That was,

6369
02:41:57,871 --> 02:41:58,704
that was just,

6370
02:41:58,720 --> 02:41:59,050
you know,

6371
02:41:59,050 --> 02:41:59,671
I mean,

6372
02:41:59,671 --> 02:42:00,590
it's not being racist.

6373
02:42:00,591 --> 02:42:01,291
I'm Mexican.

6374
02:42:01,291 --> 02:42:01,650
My PSOAS,

6375
02:42:01,650 --> 02:42:02,100
Spanish,

6376
02:42:02,100 --> 02:42:02,740
same difference.

6377
02:42:02,740 --> 02:42:03,573
Nothing wrong.

6378
02:42:03,870 --> 02:42:04,703
Ooh,

6379
02:42:04,760 --> 02:42:05,310
down.

6380
02:42:05,310 --> 02:42:06,540
They're both proud Mexicans.

6381
02:42:06,541 --> 02:42:06,751
I mean,

6382
02:42:06,751 --> 02:42:08,730
that's what he said when I
interviewed him after the fight.

6383
02:42:09,030 --> 02:42:09,420
He's like,

6384
02:42:09,420 --> 02:42:10,650
that's how Mexicans fight.

6385
02:42:10,740 --> 02:42:11,490
It's true.

6386
02:42:11,490 --> 02:42:14,790
You go fucking wrestle at Santa Ana
high school like I did getting ready for

6387
02:42:14,791 --> 02:42:15,624
masters and shit.

6388
02:42:16,200 --> 02:42:17,250
Those are some fucking,

6389
02:42:17,700 --> 02:42:18,480
those are some,

6390
02:42:18,480 --> 02:42:19,680
some fucking mean kids.

6391
02:42:19,681 --> 02:42:21,270
However they got the
shit out of each other.

6392
02:42:21,271 --> 02:42:21,400
Yeah.

6393
02:42:21,400 --> 02:42:22,231
Calvary Chapel,

6394
02:42:22,231 --> 02:42:23,730
Santa Ana and they studs,

6395
02:42:23,731 --> 02:42:25,830
they fuck each other up so bad.

6396
02:42:26,160 --> 02:42:31,160
That's where Eddie Bravo Bro grew up
Santa Ana and it's a small little place,

6397
02:42:31,861 --> 02:42:33,440
but there's some rough fucking people.

6398
02:42:34,190 --> 02:42:34,891
I'm from Long Beach,

6399
02:42:34,891 --> 02:42:35,230
man.

6400
02:42:35,230 --> 02:42:36,063
Fuck.

6401
02:42:36,210 --> 02:42:37,043
I know.

6402
02:42:37,560 --> 02:42:38,810
You get excited when you hear.

6403
02:42:38,850 --> 02:42:39,420
Oh yeah.

6404
02:42:39,420 --> 02:42:41,670
Snoop Dogg song and
went to my high school.

6405
02:42:42,390 --> 02:42:42,900
Did he?

6406
02:42:42,900 --> 02:42:43,321
Long Beach,

6407
02:42:43,321 --> 02:42:44,400
poly high school man.

6408
02:42:44,401 --> 02:42:45,630
Homeless scholars and criminals.

6409
02:42:45,660 --> 02:42:47,670
Good ass fuck scholars and criminal.

6410
02:42:48,290 --> 02:42:50,310
It's a whole homo scholars in champions,

6411
02:42:50,311 --> 02:42:52,630
but that's not what it
good fucking homeless dogs.

6412
02:42:53,120 --> 02:42:53,410
Yeah.

6413
02:42:53,410 --> 02:42:54,121
Number one,

6414
02:42:54,121 --> 02:42:56,130
NFL producing high school in the country.

6415
02:42:56,740 --> 02:42:59,940
Really more NFL players went to long
pilot in any other high school in the

6416
02:42:59,941 --> 02:43:00,270
country.

6417
02:43:00,270 --> 02:43:01,170
That's incredible.

6418
02:43:01,200 --> 02:43:02,033
Why is that?

6419
02:43:02,340 --> 02:43:04,190
Their football program is fucking amazing.

6420
02:43:04,191 --> 02:43:05,930
That's fucking fucking incredible.

6421
02:43:05,940 --> 02:43:07,620
From the offer for like 30 years.

6422
02:43:07,621 --> 02:43:08,311
It's been amazing.

6423
02:43:08,311 --> 02:43:08,520
Yeah.

6424
02:43:08,520 --> 02:43:08,970
Wow.

6425
02:43:08,970 --> 02:43:09,870
40 years actually.

6426
02:43:10,140 --> 02:43:10,960
How wild.

6427
02:43:10,960 --> 02:43:11,310
Yeah.

6428
02:43:11,310 --> 02:43:11,921
It's an old school.

6429
02:43:11,921 --> 02:43:12,000
It's

6430
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:14,650
been around since like I was
a hundred graduating class.

6431
02:43:15,250 --> 02:43:15,811
Fuck yeah.

6432
02:43:15,811 --> 02:43:17,610
1895 yeah.

6433
02:43:17,611 --> 02:43:18,760
In growing up in Newport.

6434
02:43:18,761 --> 02:43:20,410
What does it like being
around all those yachts?

6435
02:43:20,411 --> 02:43:20,950
Is it hard?

6436
02:43:20,950 --> 02:43:21,970
It's a rough dude,

6437
02:43:25,480 --> 02:43:25,631
bro.

6438
02:43:25,631 --> 02:43:26,500
Everybody had a Mercedes.

6439
02:43:26,501 --> 02:43:27,130
We had Alexis.

6440
02:43:27,130 --> 02:43:28,690
Every time you were in
front of an old restaurant,

6441
02:43:28,691 --> 02:43:28,781
it's,

6442
02:43:28,781 --> 02:43:30,430
let me throw you the keys and
go Parker where I can see it.

6443
02:43:30,520 --> 02:43:31,353
Some shit.

6444
02:43:31,810 --> 02:43:32,740
Only dark dude.

6445
02:43:33,430 --> 02:43:34,370
You just can't trust him.

6446
02:43:34,830 --> 02:43:37,180
I know you want to give him your keys,

6447
02:43:37,181 --> 02:43:39,270
your car buck and white people man.

6448
02:43:40,510 --> 02:43:41,620
Pretty it's so,

6449
02:43:41,680 --> 02:43:42,251
it's beautiful.

6450
02:43:42,251 --> 02:43:44,140
It's South Orange County is the,

6451
02:43:44,380 --> 02:43:46,310
it's the California with white people and,

6452
02:43:46,400 --> 02:43:47,470
and you know what I live,

6453
02:43:47,471 --> 02:43:48,790
I live in the southern most part,

6454
02:43:49,360 --> 02:43:51,630
other San Clemente now
in second in command,

6455
02:43:51,631 --> 02:43:53,110
you're homeless in San Diego.

6456
02:43:53,140 --> 02:43:54,480
It's fucking Sanko Minis,

6457
02:43:54,490 --> 02:43:56,080
the last good family town,

6458
02:43:56,500 --> 02:43:57,280
Orange County.

6459
02:43:57,280 --> 02:43:58,810
Cause it's just surfing and family.

6460
02:43:58,840 --> 02:44:02,830
And then for anyone my age that wants to
be hip and cool and fucking work for a

6461
02:44:02,831 --> 02:44:03,664
cool company,

6462
02:44:03,800 --> 02:44:04,870
go live in Costa Mesa.

6463
02:44:05,230 --> 02:44:06,400
Costa Mesa is a good spot.

6464
02:44:06,450 --> 02:44:07,271
I mean there's the food,

6465
02:44:07,271 --> 02:44:11,260
there's a fucking incredible and there's
ass everywhere if you're a guy out and

6466
02:44:11,261 --> 02:44:11,591
just,

6467
02:44:11,591 --> 02:44:13,150
it's a lot of good jobs and cool people.

6468
02:44:13,270 --> 02:44:13,720
No Shit.

6469
02:44:13,720 --> 02:44:15,130
Well Orange County is pretty bad ass.

6470
02:44:15,131 --> 02:44:18,280
It's just the traffic is so
ridiculous because La is so good.

6471
02:44:18,281 --> 02:44:18,520
Right?

6472
02:44:18,520 --> 02:44:19,600
Well once you get there,

6473
02:44:19,950 --> 02:44:23,350
but once you get there like people just
stay there cause it's like you can't go

6474
02:44:23,351 --> 02:44:23,970
anywhere.

6475
02:44:23,970 --> 02:44:26,140
Getting from Orange County
up to here as a fucking joke.

6476
02:44:26,141 --> 02:44:27,880
My Dad did it for 39 years.

6477
02:44:28,030 --> 02:44:33,030
He drove it down to downtown La from
fucking pill both ways in the snow.

6478
02:44:33,310 --> 02:44:34,300
He had no brakes.

6479
02:44:34,301 --> 02:44:36,750
He had to holes in the
floorboards and stuck his feet up.

6480
02:44:36,770 --> 02:44:37,603
I

6481
02:44:38,830 --> 02:44:41,100
had a bunch of built supers did he?

6482
02:44:41,130 --> 02:44:41,330
Yeah,

6483
02:44:41,330 --> 02:44:43,160
for we can be on the
fucking title dealerships.

6484
02:44:43,170 --> 02:44:45,070
So you drove up here and
then we had built Porsche.

6485
02:44:45,670 --> 02:44:47,420
What's a more reliable car?

6486
02:44:47,450 --> 02:44:51,280
The super fucking 1200 horsepower
on the stock transmission.

6487
02:44:51,850 --> 02:44:52,683
Amazing.

6488
02:44:53,010 --> 02:44:54,610
Those cried off pop.

6489
02:44:54,790 --> 02:44:55,810
I had a super,

6490
02:44:55,811 --> 02:44:56,810
that was the first good car.

6491
02:44:56,830 --> 02:45:01,150
Had no other fucking incredible and
there's still the 97 was the last year of

6492
02:45:01,151 --> 02:45:04,150
the turbo 98 and it's still,

6493
02:45:04,151 --> 02:45:07,390
you can get the thousand horsepower to
this fucking things and they look great.

6494
02:45:07,410 --> 02:45:07,600
Yeah,

6495
02:45:07,600 --> 02:45:09,160
there's still a cool looking car.

6496
02:45:09,460 --> 02:45:11,340
You see a super would that big crazy wind.

6497
02:45:11,830 --> 02:45:12,660
Ooh.

6498
02:45:12,660 --> 02:45:13,960
Pushing around like a shopping cart.

6499
02:45:14,020 --> 02:45:15,280
I loved that car.

6500
02:45:15,430 --> 02:45:16,720
Loved that fucking car.

6501
02:45:17,500 --> 02:45:20,200
Cub Swanson ready to
step into the octagon.

6502
02:45:20,230 --> 02:45:20,921
God Damn.

6503
02:45:20,921 --> 02:45:22,240
I'm looking forward to this for some.

6504
02:45:22,250 --> 02:45:23,083
You get one.

6505
02:45:23,370 --> 02:45:25,120
You don't want to see this right
here and you're going to leave.

6506
02:45:25,121 --> 02:45:25,931
You're going to be going to do,

6507
02:45:25,931 --> 02:45:26,061
man.

6508
02:45:26,061 --> 02:45:27,220
I got it going out in the lobby.

6509
02:45:27,810 --> 02:45:29,470
You got play with a woman
to ride the Werewolf.

6510
02:45:31,420 --> 02:45:32,290
Everyone's afraid of it.

6511
02:45:32,291 --> 02:45:33,370
He's fucking fired up.

6512
02:45:33,371 --> 02:45:34,420
I love that movie.

6513
02:45:35,090 --> 02:45:35,320
Yeah.

6514
02:45:35,320 --> 02:45:37,720
American world from where I'm calling
from London is when my favorite horror

6515
02:45:37,721 --> 02:45:38,410
movies of all time.

6516
02:45:38,410 --> 02:45:39,640
It's one of the all time greats.

6517
02:45:40,120 --> 02:45:40,661
It's amazing.

6518
02:45:40,661 --> 02:45:41,590
Remember silver bullet?

6519
02:45:41,680 --> 02:45:42,513
That was a great one too.

6520
02:45:43,450 --> 02:45:43,601
Well,

6521
02:45:43,601 --> 02:45:48,040

Bro.

6524
02:45:50,500 --> 02:45:51,041
Lost Boys.

6525
02:45:51,041 --> 02:45:51,874
Don't get me started.

6526
02:45:52,480 --> 02:45:53,171
I'm going to watch fighting.

6527
02:45:53,171 --> 02:45:55,240
Corey Feldman's holding up the flag.

6528
02:45:56,080 --> 02:45:56,470
Yup,

6529
02:45:56,470 --> 02:45:56,741
man.

6530
02:45:56,741 --> 02:45:57,400
He is.

6531
02:45:57,400 --> 02:45:58,000
He's,

6532
02:45:58,000 --> 02:45:58,890
he's keeping it strong.

6533
02:45:59,240 --> 02:46:00,130
The core is alive.

6534
02:46:00,220 --> 02:46:03,100
The one core together to Cory's doing.

6535
02:46:03,130 --> 02:46:04,720
Oh Man.

6536
02:46:04,840 --> 02:46:07,840
Just like a fucking bill and Ted.

6537
02:46:08,080 --> 02:46:09,560
Whatever happened at Ted or bill,

6538
02:46:09,590 --> 02:46:10,050
whoever the other

6539

Alex winter is his name.

6540
02:46:11,221 --> 02:46:12,054
He's in Los Boys.

6541
02:46:12,390 --> 02:46:15,270
Those are basically only two
moves you then I'm serious.

6542
02:46:15,870 --> 02:46:18,650
You know that I,

6543
02:46:19,190 --> 02:46:20,023
I remember names.

6544
02:46:20,430 --> 02:46:21,250
That's amazing.

6545
02:46:21,250 --> 02:46:22,560
It was Marco and the lost boys.

6546
02:46:22,561 --> 02:46:23,540
You've got you use the first day.

6547
02:46:23,550 --> 02:46:25,050
I'm probably got killed and he did.

6548
02:46:25,051 --> 02:46:25,531
He did.

6549
02:46:25,531 --> 02:46:25,980
Uh,

6550
02:46:25,980 --> 02:46:26,791
I commend you for that.

6551
02:46:26,791 --> 02:46:27,600
Thank you sir.

6552
02:46:27,600 --> 02:46:28,250
Please.

6553
02:46:28,250 --> 02:46:29,300
That's some deep trauma.

6554
02:46:29,310 --> 02:46:30,630
Come from a trivia family.

6555
02:46:30,640 --> 02:46:31,800
So that shit out.

6556
02:46:31,820 --> 02:46:34,440
I loaned it directed by Joel.

6557
02:46:35,330 --> 02:46:37,930
It's just directly by who
had a fuck do you know?

6558
02:46:38,940 --> 02:46:41,310
Just amazing that that
guy remember weird shit.

6559
02:46:41,340 --> 02:46:42,480
That's part of the reason I'm in MMA,

6560
02:46:42,481 --> 02:46:43,314
I guess.

6561
02:46:44,140 --> 02:46:45,370
Actors of all time.

6562
02:46:45,950 --> 02:46:48,340
And he was in this big
movie with that dude.

6563
02:46:48,430 --> 02:46:49,360
So you would think like,

6564
02:46:49,361 --> 02:46:49,571

6565
02:46:49,571 --> 02:46:52,970

6566
02:46:52,971 --> 02:46:53,804

6567
02:46:53,880 --> 02:46:55,390
Want was his band.

6568
02:46:55,610 --> 02:46:58,280
You ever see fucking calories

6569
02:46:58,400 --> 02:46:59,670
So he was trying out for a while.

6571
02:47:01,391 --> 02:47:02,380
All fucked up looking.

6572
02:47:02,560 --> 02:47:02,831
Yeah.

6573
02:47:02,831 --> 02:47:03,970
He had a band for a while,

6574
02:47:03,971 --> 02:47:04,570
right?

6575
02:47:04,570 --> 02:47:05,860
He has so much matrix money.

6576
02:47:05,861 --> 02:47:06,694
He didn't know what to do.

6577
02:47:08,380 --> 02:47:09,213
Million dollar.

6578
02:47:09,460 --> 02:47:10,293
No.

6579
02:47:10,770 --> 02:47:11,790
What the fuck do I do?

6580
02:47:11,791 --> 02:47:12,720
I'm going to start a band.

6581
02:47:12,760 --> 02:47:15,060
Oh it do I need to,

6582
02:47:15,240 --> 02:47:16,530
there's a documentary.

6583
02:47:16,560 --> 02:47:21,560

issues with being in a band and money and

6584
02:47:22,060 --> 02:47:23,250
like must be rough.

6585
02:47:23,340 --> 02:47:23,540

6587
02:47:23,731 --> 02:47:24,170

6588
02:47:24,170 --> 02:47:24,751
What is it called?

6589
02:47:24,751 --> 02:47:25,021
Jamie?

6590
02:47:25,021 --> 02:47:26,490
Fact artifact.

6591
02:47:26,520 --> 02:47:27,353
That's what the band,

6592

6593
02:47:28,020 --> 02:47:29,520
the movie is called about his band.

6594
02:47:29,950 --> 02:47:31,950
We had some huge struggles.

6595
02:47:31,980 --> 02:47:36,240
Is that the movie about the financial
issues with getting sued for $30 million?

6596
02:47:36,570 --> 02:47:36,960
Fuck,

6597
02:47:36,960 --> 02:47:37,793
by whom?

6598
02:47:38,280 --> 02:47:38,581
Record?

6599
02:47:38,581 --> 02:47:39,760
Company label.

6600
02:47:39,820 --> 02:47:41,070
It's like apparently it's crazy.

6601
02:47:41,130 --> 02:47:43,470
They way they do math like they do.

6602
02:47:43,730 --> 02:47:45,260
It's just fun off the so,

6603
02:47:45,540 --> 02:47:49,380
well I've heard it before like Courtney
love wrote a whole piece on at once

6604
02:47:49,560 --> 02:47:53,340
about the way they do the
accounting so that you never,

6605
02:47:53,341 --> 02:47:56,670
it never looks like they've made
money so they never have to pay you.

6606
02:47:57,130 --> 02:47:59,520
Like the only way you make
money is when you're touring.

6607
02:47:59,670 --> 02:48:00,600
That's when you make money.

6608
02:48:00,601 --> 02:48:05,160
But record sales go almost entirely to
the record company and themselves and

6609
02:48:05,161 --> 02:48:07,740
they have their own
wacky ways of deciding.

6610
02:48:07,741 --> 02:48:08,460
You know,

6611
02:48:08,460 --> 02:48:09,480
it's like Hollywood,

6612
02:48:09,750 --> 02:48:10,490
Hollywood.

6613
02:48:10,490 --> 02:48:13,900
What I've heard a lot is is any money
they spend on promoting your album,

6614
02:48:13,901 --> 02:48:17,050
they consider it a loss and they'll call
all these scenes promotional expenses,

6615
02:48:17,440 --> 02:48:22,150
so it's everybody you're paying basically
for everybody who works for the label

6616
02:48:22,660 --> 02:48:24,670
because that's rational
expense for your album.

6617
02:48:24,680 --> 02:48:25,900
Hilaire I've heard that a lot.

6618
02:48:25,930 --> 02:48:26,990
That shit as Lucas too.

6619
02:48:27,400 --> 02:48:28,660
I saw them

6620
02:48:30,240 --> 02:48:31,021
the first time I saw him,

6621
02:48:31,021 --> 02:48:31,854
they sounded great.

6622
02:48:31,890 --> 02:48:32,640
Jared led it signage,

6623
02:48:32,640 --> 02:48:33,510
just fucking awesome.

6624
02:48:33,511 --> 02:48:35,340
Then I saw him at Tahoe and they can,

6625
02:48:35,341 --> 02:48:38,360
he was trying to sing on his own without
like auto tune or something and sound

6626
02:48:38,370 --> 02:48:39,050
flux.

6627
02:48:39,050 --> 02:48:39,883
I left.

6628
02:48:40,640 --> 02:48:43,370
You walked out and then
they were terrible.

6629
02:48:43,460 --> 02:48:44,380
They were so bad.

6630
02:48:44,730 --> 02:48:45,250
It was awful.

6631
02:48:45,250 --> 02:48:45,911
When in doubt,

6632
02:48:45,911 --> 02:48:47,050
use autotune son.

6633
02:48:47,260 --> 02:48:47,531
Okay,

6634
02:48:47,531 --> 02:48:48,364
here we go.

6635
02:48:49,350 --> 02:48:50,740
Chairman Stevens and Cub Swanson.

6636
02:48:50,770 --> 02:48:51,310
Ooh.

6637
02:48:51,310 --> 02:48:54,940
Cub is quick man and he keep,

6638
02:48:54,941 --> 02:48:56,710
keep that quickness up for three rounds.

6639
02:48:56,890 --> 02:48:58,810
The real question is can
you keep it up for five?

6640
02:48:58,870 --> 02:48:59,240
You know,

6641
02:48:59,240 --> 02:49:04,240
he's got such a explosion based style
where he leaps in a lot with shit.

6642
02:49:05,610 --> 02:49:06,430
Okay,

6643
02:49:06,430 --> 02:49:07,860
Jeremy with a good kick there.

6644
02:49:08,070 --> 02:49:08,460
Ooh,

6645
02:49:08,460 --> 02:49:09,690
Jeremy Hits so fucking hard.

6646
02:49:09,691 --> 02:49:10,860
Everything's your tire flat.

6647
02:49:10,980 --> 02:49:12,300
Everything Jeremy does is heavy.

6648
02:49:12,301 --> 02:49:12,941
His kicks in,

6649
02:49:12,941 --> 02:49:13,711
his punches are very,

6650
02:49:13,711 --> 02:49:14,280
very heavy.

6651
02:49:14,280 --> 02:49:15,720
He's got a very good chin too.

6652
02:49:15,810 --> 02:49:17,550
Very rarely do you see him get stunned.

6653
02:49:18,690 --> 02:49:18,841
I mean,

6654
02:49:18,841 --> 02:49:20,820
he got knocked out by Eve Edwards,

6655
02:49:20,821 --> 02:49:24,180
but eve just caught them perfect and
caught him when he was running in,

6656
02:49:24,790 --> 02:49:25,080
you know,

6657
02:49:25,080 --> 02:49:27,390
he was attacking and eve,

6658
02:49:27,391 --> 02:49:30,300
just time to right hand
is perfectly placed hook

6659
02:49:31,950 --> 02:49:34,980
and that was what facilitated
him going down to one 45

6660
02:49:36,440 --> 02:49:38,750
but you know anybody who lost
three in a row at that point.

6661
02:49:38,800 --> 02:49:39,240
Yeah,

6662
02:49:39,240 --> 02:49:39,710
yeah.

6663
02:49:39,710 --> 02:49:42,500
Anybody running in to
something and he just,

6664
02:49:42,680 --> 02:49:43,513
you know,

6665
02:49:43,520 --> 02:49:44,181
shit happens.

6666
02:49:44,181 --> 02:49:44,750
Like,

6667
02:49:44,750 --> 02:49:45,380
like uh,

6668
02:49:45,380 --> 02:49:46,790
Benevidez and mighty mouse,

6669
02:49:46,820 --> 02:49:47,420
mighty mouse.

6670
02:49:47,420 --> 02:49:49,970
It's very rare that mighty mouse
knock guys out with one punch.

6671
02:49:50,240 --> 02:49:53,150
But Benevidez just
walked into it and boom,

6672
02:49:53,180 --> 02:49:54,470
he hit me with the same exact punch.

6673
02:49:54,471 --> 02:49:55,580
I ran into the same shit.

6674
02:49:55,790 --> 02:49:56,570
Knock me down.

6675
02:49:56,570 --> 02:49:56,750
I mean,

6676
02:49:56,750 --> 02:49:57,291
didn't knock me out,

6677
02:49:57,291 --> 02:49:57,650
but yeah,

6678
02:49:57,650 --> 02:49:57,900
he's,

6679
02:49:57,900 --> 02:49:58,310
he,

6680
02:49:58,310 --> 02:49:59,300
he's very quick,

6681
02:49:59,330 --> 02:50:00,200
very quick.

6682
02:50:02,010 --> 02:50:02,880
Ridiculously quick.

6683
02:50:02,881 --> 02:50:03,120
Yeah.

6684
02:50:03,120 --> 02:50:04,980
We were talking about Simon
Marcus and Joe Schilling.

6685
02:50:04,981 --> 02:50:08,970
That's a perfect example that you ran
out of trying to get that point back

6686
02:50:08,971 --> 02:50:13,650
because they took a point away from him
for the mouth guard and Schilling just

6687
02:50:13,651 --> 02:50:14,131
caught him.

6688
02:50:14,131 --> 02:50:14,940
Perfect.

6689
02:50:14,940 --> 02:50:16,980
There was two in that Wayne Barrett,

6690
02:50:16,981 --> 02:50:17,551
same thing.

6691
02:50:17,551 --> 02:50:19,050
The guy was chasing after him.

6692
02:50:19,260 --> 02:50:20,700
He caught him in mid air with a hook dude.

6693
02:50:20,701 --> 02:50:21,550
That was fucking night.

6694
02:50:21,670 --> 02:50:22,710
Like watching duck hunt.

6695
02:50:22,810 --> 02:50:23,643
Yeah

6696
02:50:25,590 --> 02:50:26,423
man.

6697
02:50:27,530 --> 02:50:27,750
Yeah.

6698
02:50:27,750 --> 02:50:30,900
Literally flying me out
of the sky with the hook.

6699
02:50:32,690 --> 02:50:33,710
I started the guy next to me.

6700
02:50:33,711 --> 02:50:34,544
I was like,

6701
02:50:34,660 --> 02:50:35,481
it looks like,

6702
02:50:35,481 --> 02:50:36,314
uh,

6703
02:50:36,860 --> 02:50:37,101
uh,

6704
02:50:37,101 --> 02:50:39,210
what feed Orlowski man in the air.

6705
02:50:39,230 --> 02:50:41,460
One second down your face the next.

6706
02:50:41,880 --> 02:50:43,880
That's why the flying knee is so wacky.

6707
02:50:44,390 --> 02:50:46,950
You know Duke Roufus Gate
perfect commentary on that too.

6708
02:50:46,951 --> 02:50:47,510
It was like,

6709
02:50:47,510 --> 02:50:47,691
you know,

6710
02:50:47,691 --> 02:50:48,890
you feel like you're a mortal.

6711
02:50:48,891 --> 02:50:50,420
You just kind of flying neither guy,

6712
02:50:50,421 --> 02:50:51,560
but you don't realize you're just,

6713
02:50:52,070 --> 02:50:52,903
you're fucking,

6714
02:50:53,060 --> 02:50:55,430
your face is flying towards his fist to,

6715
02:50:57,180 --> 02:50:59,010
so Jeremy's been landed some good clean,

6716
02:50:59,011 --> 02:50:59,844
right hands.

6717
02:51:00,930 --> 02:51:01,810
I like his leg kick.

6718
02:51:01,811 --> 02:51:02,640
Started riding with them.

6719
02:51:02,640 --> 02:51:04,620
Hard kicks and hard punches too.

6720
02:51:04,621 --> 02:51:05,850
And you could see cub is,

6721
02:51:06,180 --> 02:51:08,440
he's well aware that Jeremy's throat.

6722
02:51:08,470 --> 02:51:09,303
UHHH,

6723
02:51:09,420 --> 02:51:10,253
fucking slick.

6724
02:51:12,120 --> 02:51:12,630
Cartwheels.

6725
02:51:12,630 --> 02:51:14,490
One Hand because I'm a gangster.

6726
02:51:14,520 --> 02:51:17,820
He's tries to rolling thunder
shit with the round kick.

6727
02:51:18,070 --> 02:51:18,721
I'm not going to lie.

6728
02:51:18,721 --> 02:51:19,560
I've been trying to lay the,

6729
02:51:19,561 --> 02:51:21,380
it's kind of fun and never landed.

6730
02:51:21,600 --> 02:51:22,860
I just throw it in people's directions.

6731
02:51:22,861 --> 02:51:23,330
Well,

6732
02:51:23,330 --> 02:51:23,580
okay.

6733
02:51:23,580 --> 02:51:24,930
This has been trying that allowed to,

6734
02:51:24,931 --> 02:51:25,950
according to Duke,

6735
02:51:28,990 --> 02:51:31,600
I don't even think I've ever been
brushed anyone's hands that just fucking

6736
02:51:31,601 --> 02:51:32,434
throat and they're like,

6737
02:51:32,580 --> 02:51:34,870
will you ever see Brian ever
saw throw that cart wheel kick?

6738
02:51:34,871 --> 02:51:36,340
He loves that rolling thunder kick.

6739
02:51:36,350 --> 02:51:37,780
He does it really well too.

6740
02:51:37,930 --> 02:51:39,410
And he did it in a fight once ever.

6741
02:51:39,411 --> 02:51:41,800
Salt did and they thought it was a fix.

6742
02:51:42,160 --> 02:51:45,220
They were going to find him and they were
talking and they thought it was a fake

6743
02:51:45,221 --> 02:51:47,980
fight because they thought that
that technique wasn't real.

6744
02:51:49,090 --> 02:51:51,850
That's how dumb some of these fucking
people that are buying these athletic

6745
02:51:51,851 --> 02:51:52,650
commissions are.

6746
02:51:52,650 --> 02:51:55,240
It's essentially like a spinning ax kick.

6747
02:51:55,320 --> 02:51:55,630
Yeah,

6748
02:51:55,630 --> 02:51:56,650
I mean that's what it's like.

6749
02:51:56,990 --> 02:51:57,641
There was a guy,

6750
02:51:57,641 --> 02:51:58,441
a motor guy,

6751
02:51:58,441 --> 02:52:02,500
Sanchez sore kink store who's
credible and he'll do that one handed.

6752
02:52:02,770 --> 02:52:05,270
I saw him hit a dude in Holland from

6753
02:52:06,030 --> 02:52:06,910
knocking right back there.

6754
02:52:06,920 --> 02:52:10,250
We just caught cub glip to
nice right hand Sanchez,

6755
02:52:10,251 --> 02:52:10,920
it fucking,

6756
02:52:10,920 --> 02:52:14,320
and he's obese and he's not built like
your average ties short and stocky and

6757
02:52:14,321 --> 02:52:16,960
just tosses crazy fast push kicks.

6758
02:52:16,961 --> 02:52:19,540
So good to watch those high
level ties go out at two.

6759
02:52:19,541 --> 02:52:24,010
When you see like just the fluidity of
the kicking technique and the speed of

6760
02:52:24,011 --> 02:52:27,460
the motions and you just see
that next level striking.

6761
02:52:27,850 --> 02:52:28,240
Yeah.

6762
02:52:28,240 --> 02:52:29,200
It's fucking frightening.

6763
02:52:31,050 --> 02:52:32,520
What I like is Jeremy's throwing hard.

6764
02:52:32,521 --> 02:52:33,001
You can tell,

6765
02:52:33,001 --> 02:52:34,110
but he's still on balance.

6766
02:52:34,111 --> 02:52:35,550
He's not losing his foot work over it.

6767
02:52:35,640 --> 02:52:36,690
Good kickback cub there.

6768
02:52:36,780 --> 02:52:37,613
Yeah.

6769
02:52:40,710 --> 02:52:42,090
This is a high level fight man.

6770
02:52:42,300 --> 02:52:46,140
And the winner of this fight easily
could be the next guy in line at one 45.

6771
02:52:47,340 --> 02:52:47,950
Yeah.

6772
02:52:47,950 --> 02:52:48,910
You know Jane,

6773
02:52:49,420 --> 02:52:49,731
I don't,

6774
02:52:49,731 --> 02:52:50,800
I mean I'm not saying it,

6775
02:52:50,801 --> 02:52:52,870
but they said to um,

6776
02:52:52,900 --> 02:52:56,470
to Jeremy that if he won he could be a
short of a child shot or something like

6777
02:52:56,471 --> 02:52:57,131
that in some interview.

6778
02:52:57,131 --> 02:52:59,920
But honestly it doesn't mean anything.

6779
02:53:00,670 --> 02:53:01,150
It only,

6780
02:53:01,150 --> 02:53:03,580
I mean it's nice for the
good right hand by cub.

6781
02:53:03,640 --> 02:53:04,150
Oh Shit.

6782
02:53:04,150 --> 02:53:04,630
Oh,

6783
02:53:04,630 --> 02:53:05,463
caught the kick.

6784
02:53:09,520 --> 02:53:10,960
Let's see what cub does off his back.

6785
02:53:11,280 --> 02:53:13,480
It goes right to butterfly cops.

6786
02:53:13,490 --> 02:53:14,560
Got a fucking black belt man.

6787
02:53:15,220 --> 02:53:15,970
Yeah,

6788
02:53:15,970 --> 02:53:19,210
he used to coach my nephew
out in palm springs,

6789
02:53:19,430 --> 02:53:20,260
a teen.

6790
02:53:20,260 --> 02:53:21,220
He's holding on to that neck,

6791
02:53:21,221 --> 02:53:22,054
man.

6792
02:53:22,300 --> 02:53:24,280
Jeremy's got to be careful
if he scoots his butt out,

6793
02:53:24,790 --> 02:53:26,740
scoots his out and gets
a good grip on that neck.

6794
02:53:26,770 --> 02:53:28,480
He's passing his right arm through.

6795
02:53:28,481 --> 02:53:29,350
What's he doing on his right arm?

6796
02:53:31,870 --> 02:53:34,280
Is it a position where you can sweep
or go over the head for the neck?

6797
02:53:34,360 --> 02:53:35,850
This is going to watch both and he keeps

6798
02:53:36,130 --> 02:53:36,841
his hips back.

6799
02:53:36,841 --> 02:53:37,051
But I,

6800
02:53:37,051 --> 02:53:37,884
I like to wear,

6801
02:53:38,070 --> 02:53:38,903
oh he's now he's holding.

6802
02:53:38,930 --> 02:53:39,080
Hey,

6803
02:53:39,080 --> 02:53:39,691
what did you doing?

6804
02:53:39,691 --> 02:53:40,440
Fox?

6805
02:53:40,440 --> 02:53:41,220
What's going on here?

6806
02:53:41,220 --> 02:53:41,341
Oh,

6807
02:53:41,341 --> 02:53:42,900
that's the round the rounds over.

6808
02:53:43,540 --> 02:53:44,373
What does that,

6809
02:53:44,740 --> 02:53:46,570
and this isn't creepy commercial too,

6810
02:53:46,571 --> 02:53:48,310
where like if I'm going to look like that,

6811
02:53:48,460 --> 02:53:49,690
do I really want to begin this sport?

6812
02:53:49,820 --> 02:53:50,390
Yeah.

6813
02:53:50,390 --> 02:53:52,340
We're going to turn into a
pumpkin after this round.

6814
02:53:53,590 --> 02:53:53,930
Oh,

6815
02:53:53,930 --> 02:53:54,500
we really,

6816
02:53:54,500 --> 02:53:55,333
should we push it?

6817
02:53:55,460 --> 02:53:56,120
Yeah.

6818
02:53:56,120 --> 02:53:56,421
Yeah.

6819
02:53:56,421 --> 02:53:57,320
We're going to have to,

6820
02:53:57,340 --> 02:53:58,173
uh,

6821
02:53:58,410 --> 02:53:59,750
we're three hours in,

6822
02:53:59,930 --> 02:54:01,370
so this fight must be going long.

6823
02:54:01,371 --> 02:54:02,001
Is that what's going on?

6824
02:54:02,001 --> 02:54:02,301
Yeah,

6825
02:54:02,301 --> 02:54:03,200
it's already 10 o'clock.

6826
02:54:03,201 --> 02:54:04,790
We've got less than
six minutes left on it.

6827
02:54:04,820 --> 02:54:05,390
Wow.

6828
02:54:05,390 --> 02:54:05,721
Okay.

6829
02:54:05,721 --> 02:54:06,200
Well let's,

6830
02:54:06,200 --> 02:54:09,350
let's shut off and come back on
because it's in between rounds.

6831
02:54:09,351 --> 02:54:09,951
I live the audio,

6832
02:54:09,951 --> 02:54:10,731
so the audio,

6833
02:54:10,731 --> 02:54:12,170
we'll just keep running the way it is.

6834
02:54:12,171 --> 02:54:13,220
So focused on Ustream.

6835
02:54:13,221 --> 02:54:14,054
We'll be right back.

6836
02:54:14,670 --> 02:54:14,740
Okay.
