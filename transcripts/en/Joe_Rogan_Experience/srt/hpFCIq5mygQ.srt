1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:01,763
Hello,

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:05,280
you are in this,

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:10,200
this position now with this film
coming out to help a lot of people.

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:15,410
I think this film is not just going to
tell your story and in an open up a lot

5
00:00:17,491 --> 00:00:18,840
of people's eyes as to,

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:19,913
I hope so.

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,330
The AOL situation on it,

8
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:22,950
but I think a lot of people,

9
00:00:22,951 --> 00:00:23,161
you know,

10
00:00:23,161 --> 00:00:25,260
you're such a powerful
guy that I'm it from them.

11
00:00:25,261 --> 00:00:25,680
Joe,

12
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,431
I'm sure you are.

13
00:00:26,431 --> 00:00:26,700
And,

14
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:27,150
and,

15
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:27,751
and you know,

16
00:00:27,751 --> 00:00:32,751
and they didn't know how to find me or
they will find me and I'll do what I can.

17
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:34,783
Um,

18
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,450
some I give everybody as
much of a chance as I can.

19
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:40,403
Um,

20
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,870
there's a line of what's sold to abuse
survivors that I think is horse shit and

21
00:00:45,871 --> 00:00:49,350
that's basically they get
quote unquote empowered.

22
00:00:49,351 --> 00:00:52,590
And I hate that word because it
takes the strength of the word power.

23
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:57,840
What's what sounds more like power power
or empowered empires like sandy making

24
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:00,210
wear birkenstocks or something,

25
00:01:00,211 --> 00:01:00,451
you know,

26
00:01:00,451 --> 00:01:01,110
so,

27
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:02,960
so I'm not that big on empowered,

28
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:04,853
but they,

29
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,330
like I did a,

30
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:07,100
my friend Sam,

31
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:11,910
there's a podcast a couple
weeks back and he said,

32
00:01:11,911 --> 00:01:13,350
I don't want to give away with the movies.

33
00:01:13,351 --> 00:01:13,651
I said,

34
00:01:13,651 --> 00:01:14,281
listen man,

35
00:01:14,281 --> 00:01:15,450
it's not that kind of movie.

36
00:01:15,451 --> 00:01:18,900
And it hinges largely on the fact
that I survived raped as a child.

37
00:01:18,901 --> 00:01:19,051
Well,

38
00:01:19,051 --> 00:01:19,350
I got,

39
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:20,880
I heard from several people said,

40
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:21,660
you know,

41
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,760
you really should have had
a trigger warning on there.

42
00:01:23,761 --> 00:01:24,450
And it's like,

43
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:25,650
what the fuck do you shake?

44
00:01:25,651 --> 00:01:30,651
I was doing what the fuck do you think I
was doing when I said it hinges largely

45
00:01:30,721 --> 00:01:33,570
I was warning you that what
it was about right there,

46
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:36,090
but someone has empowered you to,

47
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:40,550
to have a way to take issue with me
because I'm not completely basing I,

48
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:41,760
you know,

49
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,470
the whole world isn't based around me.

50
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,570
Even though I got raped
when I was four years old.

51
00:01:45,571 --> 00:01:48,660
Everybody shouldn't be thinking in terms
of that all the time because they'd

52
00:01:48,661 --> 00:01:51,060
been through their own shit and they're
dealing with their own shit and they're

53
00:01:51,061 --> 00:01:51,990
trying to survive.

54
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,310
So if I could make them more
sensitive to this issue,

55
00:01:54,311 --> 00:01:58,760
if I can show them that it matters to
them that they deal with other people who

56
00:01:58,761 --> 00:02:02,070
have been through this kind of trauma
and we want to reduce it as much as

57
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,690
absolutely possible.

58
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:04,853
That's good.

59
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:05,790
But after that,

60
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:10,080
if I'm going to find a way to set up a
situation where I'm always the injured

61
00:02:10,081 --> 00:02:15,000
party and that prove again and again
that I'm persecuted and no one's thinking

62
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:18,090
in terms of me that I'm never
going to get fucking healed.

63
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:19,980
I'm never going to get fucking healed.

64
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:23,550
So one I did was I went out
and I try to help other people.

65
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,960
When I help other people.

66
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:29,580
I realized how far along I've come and I
realized there's really something in it

67
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:31,050
for me to do that.

68
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:33,090
And it's not like I'm this altruistic guy.

69
00:02:33,091 --> 00:02:34,920
It's like I'm saving my own life.

70
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:35,241
And you know,

71
00:02:35,241 --> 00:02:37,950
like that aol investigation
that took such courage to do it,

72
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,390
know what would have taken courage was
turning my back on those kids and walking

73
00:02:42,391 --> 00:02:42,810
away going like,

74
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:43,081
oh,

75
00:02:43,081 --> 00:02:45,600
I don't want to know
what's going on in there.

76
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,060
I.

77
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,460
How would I live with that guy?

78
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,080
How would I live with myself then?

79
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:49,620
But they,

80
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:49,801
you know,

81
00:02:49,801 --> 00:02:50,581
like I is nice.

82
00:02:50,581 --> 00:02:51,180
Everyone said,

83
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:51,751
Oh gee,

84
00:02:51,751 --> 00:02:54,090
that what he went through when
he was doing that investigation.

85
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:56,100
What about the kids in
the fucking pictures?

86
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,020
That's what I want everyone to know about.

87
00:02:58,021 --> 00:02:59,500
Thanks for caring me,

88
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,930
but it's the kids in the
pictures I give a shit about.

89
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:05,650
It's the kids that are suffering right
now somewhere within the sound of my

90
00:03:05,651 --> 00:03:06,340
voice.

91
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:11,200
Someone in this broadcast
like where this is on,

92
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:16,620
someone in the next apartment or wherever
some kid is going through this shit,

93
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,880
have the courage to know about it.

94
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:19,750
That's all I asked.

95
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:24,490
You have the courage to know about it
and save the contemporary children so you

96
00:03:24,491 --> 00:03:29,491
don't have to deal with a bunch of fucking
maniac abuse survivors up and anybody

97
00:03:31,421 --> 00:03:33,100
can diffuse the term soundscape.

98
00:03:33,101 --> 00:03:34,000
Guys coming in now,

99
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,890
if anybody can diffuse
the term trigger warning,

100
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,030
you're the fucking guy.

101
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,130
Jesus.

102
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:42,190
God Damn Christ,

103
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:42,920
stop [inaudible].

104
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,700
We're going to develop a
nation of permanent children.

105
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:51,090
Like if anybody can tell their story and
doesn't need a fucking trigger warning,

106
00:03:51,311 --> 00:03:52,950
it's you in this.

107
00:03:52,951 --> 00:03:53,621
This idea.

108
00:03:53,621 --> 00:03:53,900
I don't.

109
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,030
I don't need trigger warnings.

110
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,290
If you're going to show me something,

111
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:58,390
show me something and if
I don't want to see it,

112
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,170
let me know what it is before you show me,

113
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:01,280
tell me what the.

114
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:01,890
The,

115
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,610
the documentary was about.

116
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:04,970
No need a goddamn triggered.

117
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,940
This fucking term is disgusting.

118
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,550
It's a disgusting tournament.

119
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,760
Does damage.

120
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:13,300
It just sets people up to stay in the pit,

121
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:13,900
you know,

122
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:14,733
to wallow.

123
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:18,730
It's empowering them to wallow like we'll
I've got hurt again because the whole

124
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:19,220
society,

125
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:19,570
it's like,

126
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:21,130
sorry about that shit man,

127
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:22,420
but I'm telling you what,

128
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,550
I know you're in a pit of your own shit.

129
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:27,280
I know you're used to the temperature
and the smell of it doesn't mean you're

130
00:04:27,281 --> 00:04:29,320
used to that and it doesn't
bother you that much anymore,

131
00:04:29,321 --> 00:04:32,620
but when you stand up and they fucking
hose you off and then you'd go in the

132
00:04:32,621 --> 00:04:35,200
house and take a real shower
and put on some clean clothes,

133
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:38,830
you're not going to believe
how much better you feel,

134
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:43,950
so stop letting other people tell you
that you have to expect the world to do

135
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:48,070
the impossible and that's be the like
telepathic about what the fuck you've been

136
00:04:48,071 --> 00:04:48,730
through.

137
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:52,210
Get to the point where you can stand up
and tell them the story yourself when

138
00:04:52,211 --> 00:04:56,530
it's appropriate and don't put up with
anybody who is truly being insensitive or

139
00:04:56,531 --> 00:04:58,150
snickering about any of this shit.

140
00:04:58,450 --> 00:04:58,781
Fuck.

141
00:04:58,781 --> 00:04:59,680
People who tell me,

142
00:04:59,681 --> 00:05:01,640
people walk up to me all
the time and tell me like,

143
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:01,931
well,

144
00:05:01,931 --> 00:05:02,291
you know,

145
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:03,990
the good thing is those guys get arrested.

146
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:08,200
I am Bobo like you're
endorsing rape to me.

147
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,120
You're fucking endorsing rape to me,

148
00:05:10,121 --> 00:05:10,780
motherfucker.

149
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,040
I don't want anyone raped,

150
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:12,251
ever.

151
00:05:12,251 --> 00:05:13,410
Not even rapist.

152
00:05:13,411 --> 00:05:14,530
Rape is illegal.

153
00:05:14,531 --> 00:05:16,840
How about making jails lawful places?

154
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:17,531
How about that?

155
00:05:17,531 --> 00:05:18,130
For an idea,

156
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:22,510
how about someone going to jail and
realizing the law protects me sometime I'm

157
00:05:22,511 --> 00:05:23,321
not going to be raped,

158
00:05:23,321 --> 00:05:24,580
I'm not going to be menaced here.

159
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:28,300
I'm going to admit and maybe dale will
start thinking about getting reformed,

160
00:05:28,301 --> 00:05:31,060
but Jesus Christ don't
joke to me about right.

161
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:34,780
Don't tell me you want them all killed
and sweep them under that rug because I

162
00:05:34,781 --> 00:05:36,160
was born without blood on my hands.

163
00:05:36,161 --> 00:05:38,320
I don't want to fucking
blood on my hands now man,

164
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:43,470
so don't guess these stupid ass fucking
lightweight things and presume I'm going

165
00:05:43,981 --> 00:05:47,890
to sign off on them because I don't ever
want anyone else ever raped and if it

166
00:05:47,891 --> 00:05:48,700
happens,

167
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,050
even if it's elbow rapist,

168
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:53,470
I'm opposed to it and I don't
want them fucking killed either.

169
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,570
Now I want them to live
with what they did.

170
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,160
Now this is a difficult.

171
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,090
This is difficult thought
and it's a difficult subject,

172
00:06:02,091 --> 00:06:03,980
but did you,

173
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,380
after this is all said and done,

174
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:09,260
are horrendous moment in your life,

175
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:10,610
many moments in your life.

176
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,880
Did you try to figure out what would
create a person like the guy who did that

177
00:06:16,191 --> 00:06:16,770
to you?

178
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:18,800
Did you try how much time?

179
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:19,600
Yeah,

180
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,870
and I can tell you what created him.

181
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:23,030
He was taken out of an abusive home.

182
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:29,080
He was put into foster care and abused
many more times and he was gone and he

183
00:06:30,021 --> 00:06:30,850
was gone.

184
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:35,850
He was gone and he was succumbed by
the agony I was put through by him.

185
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:37,400
I survived.

186
00:06:37,401 --> 00:06:40,250
Somehow I made it so call me lucky.

187
00:06:40,251 --> 00:06:41,001
I'm not.

188
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:41,960
I didn't become him.

189
00:06:41,961 --> 00:06:43,520
I didn't become what I resisted.

190
00:06:43,521 --> 00:06:44,354
I didn't,

191
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:46,190
I didn't pass along the poison.

192
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,850
Maybe I didn't in some ways when
I was difficult or whatever,

193
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:51,170
but mostly I didn't.

194
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:55,940
Mostly when I'm mad I'm mad because
it's like Hendrick's a cry of love.

195
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:57,980
It's a cry of love that I make.

196
00:06:57,981 --> 00:06:58,910
It's a cry of love.

197
00:06:58,911 --> 00:07:00,230
My Act has been a cry of Levis.

198
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:03,380
Like I don't want the
innocent hurt anymore.

199
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:08,381
I don't want people victimized because
of greed and cowardice and bullshit,

200
00:07:08,781 --> 00:07:09,051
you know,

201
00:07:09,051 --> 00:07:10,900
I don't want that and so I,

202
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,830
I do what I can to stand up to it.

203
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:13,520
To.

204
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,890
Were there moments where
you wanted to talk to him?

205
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,780
What do you want to talk to them?

206
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,350
I would love to talk to him to show him
that I didn't become a monster like he

207
00:07:21,351 --> 00:07:21,870
was.

208
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,090
I W I would have.

209
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:26,750
I would have almost become an advocate
for him in the sense that like,

210
00:07:26,751 --> 00:07:26,961
well,

211
00:07:26,961 --> 00:07:29,180
maybe let me know if they're
mistreating you in here,

212
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:30,740
but he died in prison.

213
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:33,430
No one claimed his body and I
don't know where his grave is.

214
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:34,580
If I knew her as grave as I go,

215
00:07:34,581 --> 00:07:35,570
put fucking flowers,

216
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,470
not for him.

217
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:37,303
For me,

218
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:42,290
the idea that someone could do that
after someone did that to them seems

219
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:43,760
insanely counterintuitive.

220
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:45,660
It's like if someone's.

221
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,880
The only thing that saves you but
really saves you really is redemptive in

222
00:07:49,881 --> 00:07:52,070
really saves you to me

223
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:58,960
was one of the things that you covered
in the film that I thought was really a

224
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:03,620
very powerful moment where you talked
about this thing that you didn't become

225
00:08:03,621 --> 00:08:04,100
him,

226
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:08,020
that you maybe if your sister didn't
come down there and Kevin Den,

227
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,260
you could have been dead.

228
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:10,251
It was close,

229
00:08:10,251 --> 00:08:10,580
man.

230
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:11,350
It was closed,

231
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,460
but do you also that you
could have been one of them?

232
00:08:13,461 --> 00:08:14,790
You could have been someone who would.

233
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,010
Would be worse than death.

234
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:17,723
Yeah.

235
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:22,070
I'd rather be a victim of thousand times
on the perpetrator wants and that's not

236
00:08:22,071 --> 00:08:23,120
any bull shoe.

237
00:08:23,121 --> 00:08:24,830
Contemplate the mechanism.

238
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,550
Did you try,

239
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:29,150
have you tried to understand the mechanism
that turns an abused person into an

240
00:08:29,151 --> 00:08:29,780
abuser?

241
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:29,941
What?

242
00:08:29,941 --> 00:08:30,260
What?

243
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,100
What is that?

244
00:08:31,101 --> 00:08:31,480
I don't.

245
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,880
I don't think I'm as nuts and bolts
because I listened to you and I know how

246
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:36,050
much like how,

247
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,940
what detail you go into.

248
00:08:37,941 --> 00:08:39,740
So I understand how,

249
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:41,150
how on what you're asking,

250
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,310
but I can't be.

251
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,970
There's enough of me that's been
through enough that I can't be quite as

252
00:08:46,971 --> 00:08:48,890
thorough as you're asking me to be.

253
00:08:48,891 --> 00:08:49,790
To answer that.

254
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:54,380
I get as close as I can and
I understand what happened.

255
00:08:54,381 --> 00:08:55,650
But then after point I,

256
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:56,843
I can't.

257
00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:01,980
I'm not one of them and I
can't go far enough to say,

258
00:09:01,981 --> 00:09:05,370
well then of course if you get
past this point right here,

259
00:09:05,371 --> 00:09:08,070
then obviously this is
that I can't do that.

260
00:09:08,071 --> 00:09:09,300
It's that,

261
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:11,220
that is what is too much for me.

262
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,513
You know,

263
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,800
one of the reasons I was interested
in making the movie was when,

264
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,470
when Barry,

265
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:19,761
you know,

266
00:09:19,761 --> 00:09:21,680
told me that the guy had died in prison.

267
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:22,011
I said,

268
00:09:22,011 --> 00:09:23,000
how that make you feel,

269
00:09:23,001 --> 00:09:23,760
and he,

270
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,300
he said it made me sad and I said,

271
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,800
because you didn't get any closure,

272
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:28,310
you know,

273
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:29,270
you didn't get to confront him.

274
00:09:29,271 --> 00:09:29,751
And he said,

275
00:09:29,751 --> 00:09:30,021
no,

276
00:09:30,021 --> 00:09:30,890
he died alone.

277
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:32,703
And um,

278
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:35,440
I was really blown away
by that and I thought

279
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:38,740
I should really make a movie about this.

280
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:40,800
Now.

281
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,880
I thought that I thought,

282
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:43,091
well,

283
00:09:43,091 --> 00:09:43,780
this is like,

284
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:44,130
you know,

285
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:45,250
this is Jesus stuff,

286
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:45,551
you know,

287
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:46,420
and that's what this is.

288
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:49,390
And whipping on the water.

289
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,350
So,

290
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:50,790
so,

291
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:51,031
you know,

292
00:09:51,031 --> 00:09:51,820
that was,

293
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,100
that really did motivate
me to make the movie,

294
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:54,370
you know.
