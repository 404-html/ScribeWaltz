1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:01,680
Hello

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,650
Freak bitches,
your head's not to get as opposed to get

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:09,420
jostled around too much,
but it goes every direction except it

4
00:00:09,421 --> 00:00:13,770
goes right except down.
I have a buddy of mine who's a professor

5
00:00:13,771 --> 00:00:17,790
who's 49 or 50 and he kick boxes.
He's bars and I'm like,

6
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:21,240
but you know,
you understand this like you're into

7
00:00:21,241 --> 00:00:22,260
this,
you know,

8
00:00:22,261 --> 00:00:25,680
he's a history professor,
like you understand that this is

9
00:00:25,681 --> 00:00:28,200
dangerous shoe brand,
but you get so much enjoyment out of the

10
00:00:28,201 --> 00:00:32,100
thrill of being primal.
You've actually been in their sparring.

11
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,740
Let me ask you a question.
Did we,

12
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:39,700
we didn't talk about this last time,
that calcium storico thing in Italy

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,600
once.
Yes,

14
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,700
bs.
They bare knuckled football with bare

15
00:00:42,701 --> 00:00:44,050
knuckle boxing.
Insane.

16
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,130
Insane.
So I was going to go make that

17
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:48,340
documentary.
Yes.

18
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:50,650
And Berg I think ended up making it
anyway,

19
00:00:50,651 --> 00:00:52,440
but we were like,
just broken up.

20
00:00:52,441 --> 00:00:54,730
And I'm like,
why am I making a documentary of my ex

21
00:00:54,731 --> 00:00:57,310
boyfriend?
This is really self abusive,

22
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:01,570
but it's apparently the,
the month that it happens,

23
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,180
violence in the area goes down.
Of course.

24
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:05,740
Yeah.
So there's something interesting about

25
00:01:05,741 --> 00:01:09,220
these guys who want to go spar,
like maybe they're sexually harassing

26
00:01:09,221 --> 00:01:13,420
less women at work,
maybe they're having less bar fights.

27
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:16,480
This calcium storico.
So it was invented in the 16 hundreds to

28
00:01:16,481 --> 00:01:18,970
entertain kings.
It was stopped because so many people

29
00:01:18,971 --> 00:01:22,810
were dying and then I want to say 1916,
they brought it back.

30
00:01:22,811 --> 00:01:27,310
They keep it low profile because so many
people get concussions and sick group

31
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,570
kickboxing.
I think 20 on 20 a the only rule is no

32
00:01:31,571 --> 00:01:33,670
two on one.
These are grown men.

33
00:01:33,671 --> 00:01:37,550
These are not young like athletes.
They're not professional athletes.

34
00:01:37,551 --> 00:01:38,860
They're butchers,
they're lawyers,

35
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,150
they're whatever.
Exchange

36
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,830
partners.
Like guys just moved,

37
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,110
a new guy moved in,
they just touched hands.

38
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:47,210
Like one guy was duking it out with a
guy and then for some reason they

39
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,030
changed their knuckle.
It's also

40
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:53,470
by region,
so it's like neighborhoods against

41
00:01:53,471 --> 00:01:55,330
neighborhoods.
So a lot of it's like fathers against

42
00:01:55,331 --> 00:01:56,590
sons,
brothers against brothers,

43
00:01:56,630 --> 00:02:00,470
the change teammates,
like two guys were fighting and then

44
00:02:00,471 --> 00:02:02,510
another guy steps in and takes the
place.

45
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,150
First of all,
these guys have dog shit skill,

46
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,930
but it's no,
these are not a guy just stepped in.

47
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,530
These professional athletes,
these are literally guys that have other

48
00:02:12,531 --> 00:02:17,060
jobs once a year.
They just agree to fucking just fight

49
00:02:17,061 --> 00:02:18,650
each other.
It gets pretty far.

50
00:02:18,651 --> 00:02:21,350
Which one is this?
What number minute are you in?

51
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,733
Oh,
well,

52
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:25,370
okay.
You should see the ball.

53
00:02:25,371 --> 00:02:27,710
It actually.
The goal is to get the ball into the

54
00:02:27,711 --> 00:02:32,070
other side,
but when you dog shit skills and so

55
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,550
funny.
I'm just allowing me that when the

56
00:02:34,551 --> 00:02:38,780
person's scores,
they get this so hit so hard that no one

57
00:02:38,781 --> 00:02:42,160
wants to go
like everyone's like,

58
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:42,651
no,
you do it.

59
00:02:42,651 --> 00:02:47,420
You do it because as soon as you score,
people just pummel you and then you see

60
00:02:47,421 --> 00:02:49,130
these guys in the corners with
stretchers.

61
00:02:49,131 --> 00:02:51,260
They just carry people off the field the
entire time.

62
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:53,930
So this guy is holding this guy down.
So you could grapple to.

63
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,570
Yes.
The only rule you can bite.

64
00:02:56,571 --> 00:02:58,700
You can kick in the body.
You can do anything.

65
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:01,270
The only thing you can't do is to,
on one,

66
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,890
that's the only rule you can bite.
The only rule is no two on one.

67
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:07,870
You can kick in the balls.
I'm sure.

68
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:09,790
I mean maybe that's like a general,

69
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,380
like two guys are the only two guys that
are humping will these two guys.

70
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,680
This guy's got this guy's back and
there's a lot of people fucking lolly

71
00:03:16,681 --> 00:03:19,180
gag.
A lot of cherry pickers.

72
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,850
They need to get out there and they're
like,

73
00:03:23,851 --> 00:03:25,480
what the fuck am I doing?
I have a family.

74
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,750
Let's knock these guys out one at a
time.

75
00:03:27,751 --> 00:03:30,990
What the fuck are we doing here guy?
Oh,

76
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,360
someone got smacked in the.
He goes down.

77
00:03:33,361 --> 00:03:38,361
He's got the ball and went down.
Then another guy took his place is just

78
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,520
sort of avoiding the whole thing.
This ball guy looks gay as far.

79
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:42,990
No.
All.

80
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:43,801
Oh,
see,

81
00:03:43,801 --> 00:03:45,390
this is the guy gets knocked down,
but look,

82
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,810
as soon as he gets knocked down,
another guy steps in and fights the guy

83
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:51,600
that he was fighting before he got
knocked down.

84
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,140
Oh,
what a bizarre stupid.

85
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:58,220
Turns into just like a melee of madness
and it's just.

86
00:03:58,221 --> 00:04:00,860
It's actually interesting to watch the
clusters happen.

87
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,100
Like the energy going into one place.
Only one black guy.

88
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,150
Yeah,
I know.

89
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,360
That's why it's so.
That's why it's so boring.

90
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,590
Nobody wants.
And these guys are professional

91
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:17,910
athletes.

92
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:19,700
It's like they trained for it.
Like it's,

93
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:22,440
it's almost like a.
what's that thing the iron man?

94
00:04:22,441 --> 00:04:24,300
It's like a voluntary thing that they
do.

95
00:04:24,301 --> 00:04:25,860
It's tradition.
If you do it,

96
00:04:25,861 --> 00:04:27,690
if your dad did it.
Oh God.

97
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,130
Yeah.
So stupid.

98
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:32,520
And so rediculus.
Uh,

99
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:37,250
but there's a lot of tradition in it and
see everyone wears like joker uniform.

100
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,840
Sure.
What is that guys that are humping?

101
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,060
This still is bothered.
It's like,

102
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,860
Hey,
do you guys get this guys back?

103
00:04:42,861 --> 00:04:44,600
But he's not doing anything.
By the way.

104
00:04:44,601 --> 00:04:49,601
He should go out there when your
commentary like where all the black

105
00:04:50,391 --> 00:04:53,970
people.
This guy's fucking gay to more buckeyes,

106
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,370
getting happy now.
They just took them off the bed.

107
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:59,660
Another Sicilian.
This guy's annoying.

108
00:04:59,661 --> 00:05:01,670
You've got adoption scale.
Well,

109
00:05:01,671 --> 00:05:04,800
it just seems like a.
You mean a few of these guys are okay.

110
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,330
Pulling people off.
Going on.

111
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:09,690
See the yellow guys in yellow.
That's when people get fucked up.

112
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,060
Yeah.
They just get taken off the field and

113
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:15,150
then they have to play.
I think it's 2:20 minute quarters and

114
00:05:15,151 --> 00:05:18,660
then the winter,
the winters have to play again the next

115
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:23,250
day again that three days in a row,
the championship is four days later and

116
00:05:23,251 --> 00:05:27,330
the winning team,
their prize is a cow.

117
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,160
The Cow.
You get a cow,

118
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,600
a cow,
get money.

119
00:05:30,601 --> 00:05:32,640
You don't get endorsed.
The thing I like about it,

120
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,070
that attracted me to it,
there's no endorsement deals.

121
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,070
There's no.
Nothing's been promoted.

122
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:41,310
It's just people that want to fucking
fight each other

123
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:43,560
I don't understand is where's the leg
kicks?

124
00:05:43,561 --> 00:05:45,210
Do you guys not understand about leg
kicks?

125
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:46,560
Their Italian?
Yeah,

126
00:05:46,561 --> 00:05:49,260
but they're not.
There's a few kicks being thrown,

127
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,670
but no,
it's Tony Lake kicks.

128
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:51,930
They're standing right in front of each
other,

129
00:05:51,931 --> 00:05:54,350
but there's no takedowns,
so there's no takedown tabs.

130
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,060
It's just shitty boxing would the
occasional kick this is.

131
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,710
It's basically just like a giant street
fight.

132
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:02,750
Right?
But these guys have a little bit of

133
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,360
skill.
Like I'm looking at the way these.

134
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:06,640
A lot of the city.
Here's a takedown like this,

135
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:09,340
but nothing happens.
So you can take a guy down,

136
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,680
but look at the way these guys are like
standing in front of each other,

137
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:12,693
like chicken.

138
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,810
I think they probably get out there and
like are like,

139
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,980
wait,
what am I doing?

140
00:06:15,981 --> 00:06:19,730
Let's just pace around and see if we can
just get through this 40 minutes

141
00:06:19,731 --> 00:06:21,920
without.
It's so weird because they just exchange

142
00:06:21,921 --> 00:06:22,390
partners.

143
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,070
They move back and forth.
Like they,

144
00:06:24,071 --> 00:06:26,710
they,
they square off and then they decide I

145
00:06:26,711 --> 00:06:28,000
don't want to fight you.
I'm going to fight your friend.

146
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,460
Well it's so interesting because think
about it.

147
00:06:29,461 --> 00:06:33,180
It's like these are not trained guys,
but it's like if you put 20 people

148
00:06:33,181 --> 00:06:35,550
fighting,
there's no pressure to do it right away.

149
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,020
Right.
You know,

150
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,280
it's like when do you decide it's time
to take you to,

151
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:40,080
you know,
oh Jesus,

152
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,690
this is really,
what is this guy?

153
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:45,240
But the ball's going to go through.
It's got to get through.

154
00:06:45,241 --> 00:06:47,730
Yeah.
And then they're just talking shit like

155
00:06:47,731 --> 00:06:48,564
that

156
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,190
kick.
Like how do you get.

157
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:52,340
Does no one know how to kick?

158
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:54,400
No.
I think most people,

159
00:06:54,401 --> 00:06:55,870
unless they're in Thailand probably
don't.

160
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:03,200
I went and saw those fights in Thailand,
had to watch those,

161
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:04,630
but the point is,
there's.
