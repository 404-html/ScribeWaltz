Hello Freak bitches.
You said some billionaires make you

2
00:00:04,681 --> 00:00:06,360
uncomfortable.
Have you been in the room with a

3
00:00:06,361 --> 00:00:09,620
billionaire who said something or done
something that made you uncomfortable to

4
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:11,610
meet babies,
but that's normal.

5
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:14,700
That's what everybody does.
They marinate with that 48 percent tax

6
00:00:14,701 --> 00:00:16,210
bracket.
Was there any barbecue sauce or would

7
00:00:16,211 --> 00:00:18,030
they know that?
I've met.

8
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:23,090
I've met quite a few over my years of
working for the UFC and I think the

9
00:00:23,251 --> 00:00:25,440
weird thing about human beings is yos
expect,

10
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,300
well these people are going to be
fucking different.

11
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:30,540
I've met royal people.
I've met royalty in a,

12
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:33,090
especially in the Arab Emirates,
United Arab Emirates,

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,880
and a normal regular folks like you talk
to them.

14
00:00:35,881 --> 00:00:37,500
Super friendly,
super normal.

15
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,530
I know a dude who's,
you know,

16
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:44,100
he's royalty and he listens to my
podcast like weird shit,

17
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,710
but when you're around him after like a
minute,

18
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:47,970
you forget that he's royalty.

19
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,130
He wants to talk mma right now,
wants to talk.

20
00:00:50,131 --> 00:00:51,230
Techniques,
wants to talk.

21
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,780
You know what happened with that?
Why did this go wrong?

22
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:55,230
What do you think his prospects are
like?

23
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:58,410
Dudes like a super fan.
So we have these awesome like technical

24
00:00:58,411 --> 00:01:00,300
conversations about strategies and
stuff.

25
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:03,920
So like can I check in with
can,

26
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:09,290
I mean he's mad because I have large
rope,

27
00:01:09,421 --> 00:01:14,421
gold rope.
Getting neck and octagon chopper on him.

28
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,830
That's for gentlemen,
sir.

29
00:01:17,831 --> 00:01:21,280
This is a gentleman's podcast.
We are in fact on itunes.

30
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:23,680
I don't know if you know this with your
dainty gold watch.

31
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,040
What's up with that?
Watch when that shit with one of those

32
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:30,640
cranes at the fucking carnival.
Almost didn't wear it today because I

33
00:01:30,641 --> 00:01:33,430
was like Joe fucking notice this parking
lot of strange watch.

34
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,200
It's also has a club wristband on
seventies.

35
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,170
No,
it's a.

36
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:39,350
it's from the hospital.

37
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:44,650
Can I tell you something?
I was scared to fuck it.

38
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,820
I'm like,
if you're scared to what?

39
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:46,870
Nothing.
Nothing.

40
00:01:46,871 --> 00:01:49,750
To show somebody that myself.
Sometimes what happens around you is I

41
00:01:49,751 --> 00:01:53,350
get so fucking open that I ended up bad.
I'll probably get scared.

42
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:58,000
I get scared because
you have one drink and you're hammered.

43
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,980
You drink that whole bottle of champagne
first.

44
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,200
Yeah.
Oh,

45
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,610
I didn't see that
before.

46
00:02:05,611 --> 00:02:07,460
He got to celebrate way.
That's how you know someone's,

47
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:09,380
an alcoholic.
Not a word,

48
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:12,390
not a word of what anybody likes.
Some champagne.

49
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,520
Literally open up a bottle of champagne.
He didn't offer any anyone.

50
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:23,220
No one has had any of the champagne.
Burt Open.

51
00:02:23,221 --> 00:02:25,340
That shit twisted a thing.
Pop the cork.

52
00:02:25,341 --> 00:02:29,820
Oh
Duh.

53
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:33,980
To first grade.
You don't know that we have a lot of

54
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,520
liquor here.
You don't need to bring your own boat.

55
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:39,050
It was so panicked and he was going to
do this show sober.

56
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:43,490
Pop the cork and didn't tell anyone.
You didn't bring it up.

57
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:45,970
You didn't even talk about like you shot
up in front of us.

58
00:02:45,971 --> 00:02:48,260
She like fucking tied off with a rubber
band.

59
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:51,410
Put it in your tooth.
You can just fucking and,

60
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:56,520
and we're just starting
trying to pretend that it's not even

61
00:02:56,521 --> 00:02:57,690
happening.
I'm coming in hot.

62
00:02:57,691 --> 00:02:59,770
I told you that.
That's not hot.

63
00:02:59,771 --> 00:03:02,170
You came and you had to open it.
You got to fucking court in front of

64
00:03:02,171 --> 00:03:03,040
you.
This is coming in.

65
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:05,580
Rude.
Coming in.

66
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:08,540
Selfish.
Coming in.

67
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,393
Rude.

68
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,480
Dude.
I got to tell you,

69
00:03:13,481 --> 00:03:15,610
I watched one of your videos of your,
um,

70
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:18,010
your podcast and I'm jealous of your man
cave.

71
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:18,881
You know what,
I'm jealous.

72
00:03:18,881 --> 00:03:21,250
I'm ready for this.
The wood on your walls.

73
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,330
What's that?
