1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,810
We're live, Remy Warren. What's
up buddy? Hey, how's it going? Uh,

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,070
before we get started,
let me just say,

3
00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:08,660
this shirt that I'm wearing on to each
shirt is my friend Yannis patella shoes,

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,520
shirt, and a, you can get one a,

5
00:00:11,521 --> 00:00:16,521
you get a 15% discount if you go to hunt
to eat.com and use the discount code

6
00:00:16,561 --> 00:00:21,300
Rogan. Hey, you go? Yeah, I, they
gave me a discount code to use.

7
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,100
Now they give you a free
one. Well, no, I know,

8
00:00:23,101 --> 00:00:26,130
but they gave me one to
put on something and I did.

9
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,640
And they accidentally did it wrong.
And the shirts for $2 a face.

10
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:34,920
It's a jump on now. Yeah.
What was the discount?

11
00:00:34,921 --> 00:00:39,180
They fuck they'd said it like 20%
off is like $20 off an $80 shirt.

12
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:44,220
Ooh. Yeah. That had to
hurt. It's like, Oh shit.

13
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,690
So we were just talking about, uh, before
we, uh, got the podcast star that you,

14
00:00:48,691 --> 00:00:51,210
you do yoga when you're, uh,
not on the road when you're,

15
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,100
that's my workout of choice. I feel like
if I'm gonna, if I'm going to work out,

16
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,610
it's good. It's a good stretch.
Keeps, keeps me limber.

17
00:00:59,611 --> 00:01:02,730
Plus you're surrounded by hot chicks
that are sweating and it's like not a bad

18
00:01:02,731 --> 00:01:06,160
deal. So I'm going to the
wrong class. My classes,

19
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:09,660
a housewives or just trying to barely
keep it together. Oh No, not where I go.

20
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,050
Yeah.
It's probably better where I go.

21
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:19,020
There's always that one dude with the
lower back tattoo with his mat right in

22
00:01:19,021 --> 00:01:23,790
front of me and I'm just thinking,
damn, is it a weird like for a guy,

23
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:27,990
a lower back tattoo is a
real no, no. Yeah. I wonder,

24
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,680
but maybe he got it before
it was a no, no. Is that
possible? When did that happen?

25
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,770
Right when it came,

26
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,200
he was like in line and then he got it
and then he walked out and they're like,

27
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:46,190
yeah, there's certain spots. It's weird,
right? It's like certain spots where like,

28
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:50,580
like you could tattoo your arms, but if
you get up into your neck, people go,

29
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:56,250
yeah, rough childhood. As soon as
you get to your face or girls, all,

30
00:01:56,251 --> 00:02:00,480
Jesus, what the fuck you
doing? Yeah, there's, there's
certain zones that are okay.

31
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:05,280
Like hands, you start doing your
hands are very hardcore. Yeah.

32
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,410
The lower back is okay.

33
00:02:07,411 --> 00:02:10,950
If it's incorporated into everything
else on your body to be like one of those

34
00:02:10,951 --> 00:02:14,880
Japanese Yakuza style body
bodysuit things. Yeah.

35
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:17,880
It has to and you have to
work out everything else
before you get to the lower

36
00:02:17,881 --> 00:02:22,650
back. Can't start with the lower
back. But it's weird though.

37
00:02:22,651 --> 00:02:26,820
Like what the tramp stamp. Like how did
that happen? Like why did, why was it,

38
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,930
is it just because of that's what you look
at when you're having sex doggy style.

39
00:02:30,931 --> 00:02:33,190
Like you look at that spot.
What is it?

40
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,940
I think it was so you could,
you could see it like the low rep,

41
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:42,340
low rider pants and the crop
top shirt. Oh right. You know,

42
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:48,630
hey, she's a hoe. She's makes mistakes.

43
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,880
She's impulsive. Yeah. That's another
thing. Dudes are not allowed to do it.

44
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:57,240
You can have no shirt on but you
can't have a half shirt. No. You know,

45
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:02,480
or, or like you can have shorts or long
pants, but capris you don't create,

46
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:07,450
those are up the knees. The
calves the half. That's so true.

47
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:12,100
You can't have, you can't have, it's a no
go. That's a definite no go. How's that?

48
00:03:12,101 --> 00:03:14,830
It's weird like the,
no, the no shirts. Okay.

49
00:03:14,831 --> 00:03:16,810
Like if you're at the beach
and you have no shirt,

50
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:21,000
but if you had a jog bra type set up,
not happening baby,

51
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,180
you can't do it.

52
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:25,840
Well you'd have to custom make it and
then that's just awkward in itself. Right?

53
00:03:25,841 --> 00:03:27,790
Like why did you cut the
bottom of your shirt off?

54
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,100
You can cut the sleeves off my
belly to be free, Bro. Yeah.

55
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:35,650
I like it to be free and we have weird
choices when it comes to that. Like I do,

56
00:03:35,651 --> 00:03:38,830
I fucking still to this day take
more shit for wearing a fanny pack.

57
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:43,570
I notice was that was
like leather fanny pack.

58
00:03:43,571 --> 00:03:46,540
That's next level shit.
Fucking strong.

59
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:50,290
I learned about it from dice clay dice
clay was in here and he had this very

60
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:53,470
strong fan. Oh what is this you're
showing us here. That's real.

61
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:58,940
Is that it says kid Cuddy wore
a crop top to Coachella. No,

62
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:03,490
he did. He did. He really did. Kid
cutting. Where that he was in the podcast.

63
00:04:03,491 --> 00:04:07,530
He didn't seem gay. Well there
he is. Look at that. Hmm.

64
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,250
What the fuck ever take your
shirt off son. There's rules.

65
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:16,450
There's rules in this life. Well I guess
maybe if you got that nice to haves.

66
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:20,040
Yeah, that's no good. It's that backpack
one up there. That one would the uh,

67
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:22,960
that we were just showing
this one for folks listening.

68
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:25,840
This is fucking completely ridiculous
because it's a sweat shirt,

69
00:04:25,841 --> 00:04:27,430
like a big puffy sweatshirt,

70
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:32,500
but it's been cut at the midriff
like right where the lower rib is.

71
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:36,840
That's where it's cut. I
just, I don't think I'll ever
get into that fashion. Sure.

72
00:04:36,841 --> 00:04:38,800
Now, yeah, that's,

73
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:42,450
there's someone saying something that
I don't know what he said, but I don't,

74
00:04:42,451 --> 00:04:47,050
I don't want to hear it. Whatever
that guy's saying. It's weird.

75
00:04:47,051 --> 00:04:50,140
It's weird rules. You know
when, when I've gone hunting,

76
00:04:50,141 --> 00:04:53,290
people have given me shit for having
two different kinds of clothes.

77
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,090
Like you have like a COO, you shirt on
and Sitka pants. Like, okay, I'm, I'm the,

78
00:04:58,091 --> 00:05:00,280
I've always,
my whole life been the opposite of that.

79
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:04,960
I would just mix and match so
I'm not wearing like the hated,

80
00:05:04,961 --> 00:05:08,620
when I called it like the pajamas,
like you look like you're wearing a one z.

81
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:12,580
Like I'll use the same company maybe,
but a couple of different shades. Yeah.

82
00:05:12,581 --> 00:05:17,260
Top and bottom. The hunting thing is
a bit of a fashion thing, you know,

83
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,970
it is like there's,
there's,

84
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:23,350
it's weird because it's like one of the
few times where men will comment on each

85
00:05:23,351 --> 00:05:26,740
other's fashion, you know, like
men, men, they'll go, hey man,

86
00:05:26,741 --> 00:05:30,130
those are a nice blue jeans, bro. Let
me, I like the cut. Who's making those?

87
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:33,600
Like you're staring at my Dick,
something's going on. Well, it's like,

88
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,750
it's acceptable to,

89
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:38,510
for men to wear a $500 pair of pants
when they're hunting pants. Yeah.

90
00:05:38,511 --> 00:05:43,510
What is that? Right. But
there's like, there's a fashion
east, that thing going on,

91
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:44,883
you know,

92
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:49,120
and I think a lot of the
camouflage isn't even for animals.

93
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:52,420
Eyesight is for humans. Totally
freaky Yolanda, this stuff,

94
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:56,620
they've done so many studies on
camouflage, you know? And that's, uh,

95
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,220
I actually did this thing

96
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:03,080
for apex. We're looking into
camouflage and it's just crazy.

97
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:06,430
It's one of those things like we
have a lot to learn about camouflage,

98
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:11,430
but we already see what can they say? What
can animals see? They vary, right? Yeah,

99
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,320
yeah. Let's take some shitty
eyesight, right? Yeah.

100
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:18,290
But so like the way
camouflage works is there,

101
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:22,070
there's like matching where you're
kind of just matching the environment,

102
00:06:22,071 --> 00:06:26,570
maybe one shade of like sand colored
bottom and then there's like modeled where

103
00:06:26,571 --> 00:06:31,571
its spot as rock type shape and then
there's disruptive where it essentially

104
00:06:31,851 --> 00:06:35,540
breaks up the outline of whatever it is.
So it doesn't look like what it is.

105
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:37,280
And disruptive I think,

106
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:42,550
in my opinion is probably
the most effective camouflage
when you like start to

107
00:06:42,711 --> 00:06:44,870
really analyze it,
is that this disruptive,

108
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:48,410
like firstlight has this
kind that's like dark stripe,

109
00:06:48,411 --> 00:06:52,580
light stripe and it doesn't box.
Yeah. And so sometimes you're like,

110
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:55,940
it's like you look at it and it
doesn't really look like if it doesn't,

111
00:06:55,941 --> 00:06:59,660
if camouflage he doesn't look
like anything, then that's
the best I would say. So.

112
00:06:59,661 --> 00:07:02,390
And so is the idea that it
breaks up the shape of a human,

113
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:06,320
like different ones with
the animals. Yeah, exactly.

114
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:11,290
They see the shape of a human go that's
done. Yeah. I did this thing, uh,

115
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:14,420
it was a friend of mine is
a army sniper and so forth.

116
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:17,510
Apex episode did a,
made a Ghillie suit.

117
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:22,450
Crazy. Like it was cool. Like a legit one,

118
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:25,070
not one of those like goofy
and looked like the swamp.

119
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,870
We still look like the swamp thing but
were you would just like veg up and match

120
00:07:29,871 --> 00:07:33,740
your exact surroundings
and I'm not kidding you.

121
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:36,560
We took a picture where he was
like standing there and three,

122
00:07:36,561 --> 00:07:40,520
four feet away you just disappear. Do
you have the picture? Uh, if you have it.

123
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,330
So I'm going to email to Jamie if you
have it and I'll put on the screen and

124
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:49,070
I'll see you again. They say that Turkeys
have like really, really good eyesight,

125
00:07:49,071 --> 00:07:53,630
right? Yeah. Like when I wore
like a mask, a Ghillie suit mask,

126
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:57,290
like a shitty one. Yeah. You know when
we went Turkey hunting is, but it was,

127
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,010
you know, just like just see out
with a slit. But it was cool.

128
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:03,220
It's cool to wear it. I felt
like I was really hiding. Yeah,

129
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,820
I'm invisible but they can't see like,
you know,

130
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:11,480
like you have like those real tree
cammo prints that look just like leaves,

131
00:08:11,481 --> 00:08:14,120
like deers, can't see that.
And then I think, you know,

132
00:08:14,121 --> 00:08:18,050
I mean in my opinion it just turns
to black once you get it to a certain

133
00:08:18,051 --> 00:08:18,620
distance.

134
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:23,620
So some of some camouflage is just really
like based on how far away from your

135
00:08:24,141 --> 00:08:26,180
pray you might be. Cause like
that kind of stuff. You know,

136
00:08:26,181 --> 00:08:30,560
he's made for tree stand and it looks
cool and grew up in the tree in there.

137
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:34,040
You could probably wear blaze orange
pumpkin suit and they wouldn't see you

138
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:38,330
anyways. Right. You're
still high. Yeah. That's uh,

139
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:39,171
yeah.

140
00:08:39,171 --> 00:08:43,970
I mean then you get out of distance
and it just looks black or dark.

141
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,410
So it doesn't really,

142
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,320
I wouldn't think it'd be effective
for like what I do out west or in the

143
00:08:48,321 --> 00:08:49,860
mountains and things like that.
Yeah.

144
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,820
There's a bunch of weird things that
I'm starting to notice cause obviously I

145
00:08:52,821 --> 00:08:55,920
haven't been hunting for that long.
There's a bunch of weird fetishes.

146
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,850
The clothes fetish is one of them.
There's a, there's a boot fetish for sure.

147
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,780
The questions I get asked all,

148
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:07,360
it's like always hold on up to this
microphone secret. Super Directional. Yep.

149
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:12,550
Is that better? Yeah. I just
leaning, leaning like a Cholo or, um,

150
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:17,590
yeah, the things I get asked
the most boots in Cammo pattern.

151
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,090
It's, that's it. Well people
get into it, you know,

152
00:09:21,091 --> 00:09:24,180
they think about it before they're doing
it and so it becomes something like

153
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,410
they want to look the part.

154
00:09:25,411 --> 00:09:29,160
It's like guys want him wearing Nike
sneakers and the right shorts when they go

155
00:09:29,161 --> 00:09:32,130
play pickup basketball.
It's kind of the same thing.

156
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:35,160
I always get a rifle hunters like
come out on El. So they're like,

157
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:38,430
well this camouflage match,
we're, we're hunting.

158
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:42,030
And my answer is you have a
rifle. Like if, if they see,

159
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:46,050
if they see the shirt underneath
your jacket, you're already screwed.

160
00:09:46,051 --> 00:09:50,160
So we don't necessarily need to worry
about it. But I mean, that being said,

161
00:09:50,161 --> 00:09:53,190
I do wear camouflage, meaning for people
don't understand what we're saying.

162
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:57,640
When you rifle hunt, you're really far
away. Whereas if your bow hunting and elk,

163
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:01,650
you would be proud of you like to
be within 50 yards. Yeah, exactly.

164
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,040
What's like the longest shot you've
ever taken on an elk with a archery?

165
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:10,920
Oh, probably wouldn't be an elk.
Could be a deer. Um, about 80 yards.

166
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:16,080
But that's a long ways. That's
not typical. Like everything
was perfect, you know?

167
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:20,580
Yeah. That's a tricky thing,
right? With archery learning when,

168
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:24,660
when you can pull something like that
off. Yeah, exactly. Because the thing is,

169
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:27,840
you know, I think a lot of people
too, like a lot of hunters,

170
00:10:27,841 --> 00:10:31,850
they've got like this debate on what's
ethical for distance. Other things.

171
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:36,130
I think it just depends on the
situation cause there's, I,

172
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:40,890
I've taken a few animals that what I
would consider like the edge of ethical

173
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:43,920
range,
but yet I've never lost one.

174
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:47,970
But the only animal that I've ever not
recovered was like 30 yards, you know?

175
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:51,330
So anything can go wrong
at any distance is just,

176
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,480
I think it's one of those things, cause
I think when you take it further shot,

177
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:56,540
you know,
your banking on your,

178
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:00,270
you're paying maybe more attention
to all the exact, you know,

179
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,580
and not just getting like all it's close,
it's going to happen.

180
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:04,800
Is that one of the biggest
issues that you have when,

181
00:11:04,801 --> 00:11:08,760
cause I know you take out like
really new hunters sometimes. Yeah.

182
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:14,010
Like one of the bigger issues must
be having them make a correct shot.

183
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,530
Yeah.
That that is,

184
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:19,950
that's the hard part because
I think if you're new hunter,

185
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:24,810
you may not expect the reactions that
you're going to have in the moment.

186
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:28,200
You can shoot at the range all you want.
You can do all this other stuff,

187
00:11:28,201 --> 00:11:32,310
but you can't factor in that emotion of
when you're about to take an animal's

188
00:11:32,311 --> 00:11:36,060
life. And that's, that's something
you can't practice. You know,

189
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:40,620
it's just that. And so yeah.
So that part of like I,

190
00:11:40,621 --> 00:11:44,760
if I'm with someone, I try to keep them
calm and just, cause if, if you're,

191
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,960
if somebody that's with you is
just like, Oh, a gag, hurry up,

192
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:53,650
then you're going to be panicked and you,
you're going to just

193
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:57,640
not make a good shot. Whereas
if the person like, okay,
you know, take your time.

194
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:00,100
Like just real calm and mellow.

195
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:04,150
Do you know of anybody that's ever
used Beta blockers, Beta blockers,

196
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:08,080
Beta blockers or something
that performers use?

197
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:10,210
I've never experimented with them but uh,

198
00:12:10,211 --> 00:12:14,230
recently got a prescription because
I just want to see what the deal is.

199
00:12:14,231 --> 00:12:17,960
I'm trying to figure out when would
be a good time to try it. I would,

200
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:22,480
I would think like archery elk would be
like the perfect time to try it because

201
00:12:22,481 --> 00:12:24,350
your heart rate is just jacked.

202
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:28,930
Your adrenaline is flying and your
nerves are crackling. Like, uh,

203
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:30,760
I think archery,

204
00:12:30,761 --> 00:12:35,761
elk hunting probably the most nervous
I've ever been next to like martial arts

205
00:12:35,861 --> 00:12:37,420
competition.
Like right up there,

206
00:12:37,421 --> 00:12:41,950
right at the edge of like martial
arts competition is like, it gets,

207
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,670
it gets to this point where people
go into shock. Like just, it's just,

208
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:49,720
you see it even in the UFC sometimes you
see like guys just can't perform right.

209
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:54,290
They just kid, they're, they're
overwhelmed by, by the, uh,
the moment, the, the, the,

210
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,690
the nerves, the adrenaline dump,
the whole thing that is raw.

211
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:01,270
And the guys who were just heroes and
the gym, they get on those bright lights,

212
00:13:01,271 --> 00:13:03,940
they can't do it.
I think archery,

213
00:13:03,941 --> 00:13:08,500
elk hunting is probably the closest you
can get to martial arts competition that

214
00:13:08,501 --> 00:13:10,870
I've experienced. And I
was wondering like, man,

215
00:13:10,871 --> 00:13:15,520
I bet if you took a Beta blocker that
would probably alleviate a lot of that.

216
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:19,050
It could, does it last for a long period
of time. Cause you never know when them,

217
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:21,940
it's like, yeah, you take it in the
morning and you're just kind of like,

218
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,460
what does it tell you out?
Oh okay.

219
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:28,510
Apparently what it does is it
blocks the reaction. I should have.

220
00:13:28,511 --> 00:13:31,450
Like Mark Gordon explained
it to me and Dr. Gordon,

221
00:13:31,451 --> 00:13:35,260
who's a buddy of mine has been on the
podcast a bunch of times who told me about

222
00:13:35,261 --> 00:13:35,710
it,

223
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:40,710
but like I watched this
television show and it was on um,

224
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,140
nerves and on,
um,

225
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:48,070
reactions to stress and pressure and
they had these, a concert, um, uh,

226
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:52,210
performers like classical music
performers and they would talk about how

227
00:13:52,211 --> 00:13:56,560
difficult it is to perform in front of
live audiences and they discovered Beta

228
00:13:56,561 --> 00:14:00,700
blockers. And then the guy
was saying like, it just
changed my life. He said, no,

229
00:14:00,701 --> 00:14:05,701
I take a Beta blocker and I can perform
easily the way I perform in the studio

230
00:14:05,981 --> 00:14:09,160
when we're practicing in
front of thousands of people.
It's no problem at all.

231
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:12,460
Yeah. I've noticed that,
that, that excitement level
just cloud your thinking too.

232
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:16,510
And that's what in hunting you don't
anticipate because all of a sudden you're

233
00:14:16,511 --> 00:14:18,190
now doing things with clouded judgment.

234
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:22,490
And I guarantee like
animals can feel that,

235
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,320
that tension, I don't know what
it is or what they're feeling,

236
00:14:26,321 --> 00:14:30,430
but if you are just out there observing
an animal or don't really care,

237
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:33,070
don't get that excited. It's
almost like some people go, oh,

238
00:14:33,071 --> 00:14:36,280
how did right before I was going
to shoot it ran off. You know,

239
00:14:36,281 --> 00:14:39,580
it's because of that. Just like as that
excitement level grows and you freak out,

240
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,580
I feel like they sense that energy.

241
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:45,040
They've got a different way
of feeling their environment.

242
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:46,630
I mean fish especially do that.

243
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:50,110
They can feel like when I was
spear phishing and you dive down,

244
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:54,620
you would consciously try to lower
your heart rate and the fish would swim

245
00:14:54,621 --> 00:14:55,454
towards you.

246
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:59,300
What is your freaked out official will
not come near you or they'll even swim

247
00:14:59,301 --> 00:14:59,900
away.

248
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:04,490
So you go down there and you just have
to like essentially zen out and then the

249
00:15:04,491 --> 00:15:09,110
fish swim up to you and the
jab them. Yup. Like Sushi.

250
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:10,900
I, whoa. I wonder, I mean we're,

251
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:15,910
we just assume that animals have all the
same sets of skills or the same sets of

252
00:15:16,401 --> 00:15:17,450
senses that we do.

253
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:21,410
But fish have a bunch of weird things
like that lateral line across their body

254
00:15:21,411 --> 00:15:25,730
which detects movement and they can get
other things from that. Right. What else?

255
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,520
Well it's essentially detecting
vibrations in the water. Yes.

256
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:34,310
So it's anything from heart
rates to fish swimming,

257
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:37,040
other animals moving in the water.
They can detect heart rates.

258
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:38,600
Would that lateral line?
Wow.

259
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:42,650
The line with what that means
for people don't understand.

260
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:43,700
What I'm saying is there is a,

261
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:48,970
if you go from a fish's gills and draw
a straight line back to their tail,

262
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:54,200
there's actually a line there and that
line is just solid like nerve endings.

263
00:15:54,201 --> 00:15:55,880
Right?
Sensitive nerve endings.

264
00:15:55,881 --> 00:16:00,881
It pick up things that we can't detect
in the water and also the senses of smell

265
00:16:02,631 --> 00:16:05,510
like can you imagine what a fucking
elk sense of smell must be like?

266
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:09,530
They probably can smell things that
we don't even think smell like fear.

267
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,180
Like they probably can smell it.

268
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,030
You pronounce or sweating a
little more and fuck. Yeah. Yeah.

269
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,620
A lot of predators when they
go into that final stock mood,

270
00:16:18,621 --> 00:16:22,340
their heart rates slow down.
Really? Yeah. Oh that makes sense.

271
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:25,550
Cause like when you see a cat on
a cat's about the bus to move,

272
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:30,840
they start moving really slow and then
they fucking done the mad mad dash.

273
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:32,901
Yeah.

274
00:16:32,901 --> 00:16:37,901
It's like the lulling their prey into a
false sense of contentment and security.

275
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:42,620
They're cool to watch. We did a, we
did an apex episode and we were like,

276
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,320
well it's, explain what that means.
You have a show called Apex Predator.

277
00:16:45,321 --> 00:16:49,460
It's fucking great show. And it's on
sportsmans channel toward channel.

278
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:51,500
They're the same.
They're owned by the same people,

279
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:56,650
which is a fucking pain in the ass now
because that is removed from Viacom.

280
00:16:56,810 --> 00:17:01,580
They work that shit out yet. I
don't know. Yeah, there was a,

281
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,460
um, there was a website that
you could go to. What was it?

282
00:17:04,461 --> 00:17:08,780
Keep my outdoor TV or something
like that. Jamie. I think

283
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:15,320
Verizon, Verizon. Um, I guess, uh,

284
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:18,770
what is it?
Fiber optic Fido's they,

285
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:23,330
they pulled all of the hunting channels
and then like, yeah, that's what it is.

286
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:28,010
So what is the, um, keep,
keep my outdoor tv.com.

287
00:17:28,011 --> 00:17:31,400
You can, uh, go there
and it'll show you, look,

288
00:17:31,401 --> 00:17:35,730
it's telling you to drop Verizon
switched providers today. I can, oh,

289
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:40,340
this is that. So how does, how do you, is
that like a satellite thing or what's it,

290
00:17:40,341 --> 00:17:45,200
Verizon is a fiber optic line and it's a,
I believe it's done like the Internet,

291
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:46,340
you,
you get a,

292
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:50,340
it's Verizon files cause
they have a Verizon fiber

293
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:54,570
optic Internet service. And for
whatever reason, I don't know.

294
00:17:54,571 --> 00:17:56,730
I don't know what it was,
whether it's some sort of a,

295
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:01,500
a deal that they couldn't make or whether
they're actually trying to force out.

296
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,210
That's what people are worried about,

297
00:18:03,211 --> 00:18:08,211
that they're forcing out hunting and
fishing shows and they're just removing

298
00:18:08,701 --> 00:18:12,810
them because they, they don't like
it or they think it's distasteful.

299
00:18:12,811 --> 00:18:16,710
Or maybe someone at the very top is a,
uh,

300
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:20,010
animal rights person. Well, I
dunno, I dunno. I really don't know.

301
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:25,590
But that would suck if you really
enjoyed watching those shows, which I do.

302
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:30,330
And you a, all of a sudden Verizon
says, oh well this isn't on, but hey,

303
00:18:30,331 --> 00:18:35,100
you can watch some fucking
fake reality show on, you know,

304
00:18:35,101 --> 00:18:38,190
people that fake live in the
woods on the discovery chat.

305
00:18:38,191 --> 00:18:40,800
Cause that's what they're recommending.
Like when people go, yeah,

306
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,030
when people are going to that,

307
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:46,920
they're actually recommending
these rigged shows, which,

308
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,760
you know, some of them are fun, like
life below zero. That's, but that's,

309
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:54,780
those are real events. Like you watch that
show, they don't have to fake anything.

310
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:59,280
There's those fucking people a really
live in 200 miles above the arctic circle.

311
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:04,440
So as soon as state, if they're
like, you really liked a meat eater,

312
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:09,810
but instead you can watch Alaska,
Yukon bear country, gold survival,

313
00:19:09,811 --> 00:19:10,644
pawn shop.

314
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:16,830
You just said that.
But that's going to be a show now.

315
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:22,370
Someone's listening going Quick Rock Climb
Down Jab has to go into the Yukon and

316
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:27,920
find some gold while he shoots a moose
for survival to selling his dad's punk

317
00:19:27,921 --> 00:19:31,020
job. And at the end of the
show, it's a cooking contest.

318
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:37,310
They have a barbecue off and
Kanye West is just a fierce dude.

319
00:19:37,951 --> 00:19:41,670
I watched one of those barbecue shows.
I was hooked instantly. I was like,

320
00:19:41,671 --> 00:19:44,630
how the fuck am I going to
get hooked by a barbecue show?

321
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:48,150
Just a bunch of guys barbecuing. I'm
like, this is going to be boring.

322
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,070
They're not going to get
me. Meanwhile, they got me.

323
00:19:50,071 --> 00:19:51,560
I was there for the whole episode.
The next one.

324
00:19:51,561 --> 00:19:53,850
That was one of those back to back deals
where they showed like two or three

325
00:19:53,851 --> 00:19:56,160
episodes in a row.
I watched three of those fucking things.

326
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:59,520
Three fucking shows where guys are
trying to make the perfect brisket,

327
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:01,800
but there's no secrets given out.
I'm sure.

328
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:05,430
Oh you you're no better of a barbecuer?
No.

329
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,250
Well you know the best way
to do it is pellet grills.

330
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,640
That's what one thing I
realized. Really? Yeah.

331
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:14,280
I'll a lot of those big time barbecue
competitions, these pellet grills now,

332
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:17,520
because pellet grills,
if you don't know what I'm talking about,

333
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:20,250
pellet grills use a real hardwood,

334
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:24,840
but say if you buy a table like this and
they have to saw it when they saw it,

335
00:20:24,841 --> 00:20:28,840
they take the saw dust. Either
use one pellet grill. No,

336
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:31,990
I've got like a pellet stove.
But is it the same thing? No,

337
00:20:31,991 --> 00:20:35,080
it was like a fireplace but it
uses like compacted pellets. Yeah,

338
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,610
we're real similar. They use
these, uh, it looks like, um,

339
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:43,320
like a little cylinder, a little tiny
cylinders that are compressed, saw,

340
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:46,770
saw dust and the natural sugars in
the wood is the only thing that keeps

341
00:20:46,771 --> 00:20:50,590
together. Like if you take it with your
fingers, you can break it up and it,

342
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,840
there's a hopper, like a big, um,

343
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:58,290
like a big metal box and underneath the
hoppers a worm drive and it spins and it

344
00:20:59,081 --> 00:21:01,180
feeds it to an element.
And the element,

345
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:03,760
there's like a cup and then
there's an element and the, the,

346
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,870
the pellets drop into the cup and
the element is below the cups.

347
00:21:06,871 --> 00:21:10,510
So the element heats it and starts
a fire and it keeps it at a steady

348
00:21:10,511 --> 00:21:14,440
temperature, like plus or minus one
or two degrees. It's really good.

349
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:18,580
And like a bucket of the hopper,
which is filled, like say, look,

350
00:21:18,581 --> 00:21:23,080
it looks like maybe a five or 10 10
gallon bucket will last for days.

351
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,720
It's amazingly efficient. I
have a Yoder, but uh, they,

352
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,010
they have a green mountain
grills when I had to.

353
00:21:30,011 --> 00:21:33,580
It's just really good and they're fairly
inexpensive and you can barbecue on

354
00:21:33,581 --> 00:21:36,700
those things. Slow Cook and that's
what it looks like. See that hopper,

355
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:40,810
like a pellet stove or whatever.

356
00:21:40,811 --> 00:21:43,710
But so you see how it works there
with the warm drive where I'm drives,

357
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:48,200
feeds it into the fire and then
it's slowly cooks. That's cool.

358
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:53,110
Ah Dude. It's like cooking on wood but
you don't have to deal with wood. Exactly.

359
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:56,170
It's all wood.
It's does no chemicals whatsoever.

360
00:21:56,410 --> 00:22:01,260
And you get that smoky taste to the
meat too. It's really nice. I grill on,

361
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:05,120
I have a Yoder that I really
like because it has a,

362
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,790
an option for direct heat where you
crank it up and the fire gets really high

363
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:13,450
and then you put those grill grates
down. Like I remove this, uh,

364
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:18,310
it's like heat diffusion plate. It's
like, uh, you know, for like slow cooking.

365
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,770
You take that out and then the fire
goes right under the grill grades.

366
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,610
It's amazing for steaks for, for anything.
That's awesome. Yeah. That's great. Yeah.

367
00:22:24,611 --> 00:22:27,310
Cause I, I love cooking
over wood. I've got,

368
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:31,690
except I've got like three cords of woods
stack down the cabin. I'll do you. Yeah.

369
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:34,750
Do you do it rich? Do
you do so like, like uh,

370
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:39,280
like smoking with like a real smoker or
you have to feed the logs and make sure

371
00:22:39,281 --> 00:22:43,780
the temperature stays down the smoker?
I do the, you know, glass door,

372
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:47,920
easy thermometer on it. Oh yeah.
Forget it. George Foreman stuff.

373
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:52,050
George form and style. Do they have a
George Foreman smoker? I don't know.

374
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:56,500
They should. They will know. Yeah. I
had one that I used that was like, um,

375
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:02,280
what does that one company that makes
a lot of like smoking a hunting style

376
00:23:02,711 --> 00:23:07,540
stuff and they make a vacuum
cu? Yes. Western. Yeah.

377
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,080
I had a western smoker. We had to
add wood chips to it. It was kind of,

378
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:14,920
it was fairly like self

379
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:19,120
throw him in the bottom and turn it on.
That was okay.

380
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:21,310
But once I started fucking around
with that Green Mountain Grill,

381
00:23:21,311 --> 00:23:24,220
I gave up on that completely. Just
like, oh, this is so much easier.

382
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:26,110
And it's just as good, like, look,

383
00:23:26,111 --> 00:23:30,610
it wasn't like there was any
benefit to doing it the other way,

384
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:36,220
but I think there is something about
a real wood smoke or like when I watch

385
00:23:36,221 --> 00:23:37,620
those barbecue competition.
Yeah,

386
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:43,590
there's something about figuring out
how much to open up that little door to

387
00:23:43,691 --> 00:23:47,530
make the air go in just enough to keep
that temperature steady and they're

388
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:52,190
checking out. There's something
that like men do with fire.

389
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:56,570
There's like some weird thing like, like
if you're out, like if you're at a fire,

390
00:23:56,571 --> 00:23:59,420
like a camp fire and you're hanging
around with a bunch of people,

391
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:02,840
like a guy who could make a
fire good like you, like Ah,

392
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:04,100
you fucking nailed it later.

393
00:24:04,101 --> 00:24:07,820
That has a good fire and you're all
sitting around and it's like there's

394
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:11,390
something about men and fire
that just goes right to your DNA.

395
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,030
Oh yeah.
I always say,

396
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,900
because I do a lot of hunting alone
and you might be in like random.

397
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:20,920
I was in Africa one time
just by myself and it was,

398
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,920
you hear these noises even never heard
before and as soon as you get that fire

399
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:27,580
going, it's just a comforting,
it's a comforting feeling.
I think. It's just like,

400
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,820
it's a primal thing that,
you know, if you have a fire,

401
00:24:30,821 --> 00:24:31,930
you're going to survive through the night,

402
00:24:31,931 --> 00:24:34,620
whether it's cold or
whatever that fire is,

403
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:38,740
is just our safety system most likely.
And you see it and you're like, Ugh,

404
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,900
I feel more comfortable. Yeah, that's good

405
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:45,410
Rinella. Uh, when he was here, he was
here a couple of weeks ago and uh,

406
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,880
as he was here,

407
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:51,860
he got a text from his friend that
they had just taken this kid out. Like,

408
00:24:51,861 --> 00:24:55,940
I think he's 18 years old. Yeah. On his
first hunt ever while he's in a tent,

409
00:24:55,941 --> 00:24:59,720
he gets attacked by a 500
pound predatory black bear.

410
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:03,750
He wakes up to this bear biting
his head. His friend, he's scream,

411
00:25:03,751 --> 00:25:08,210
his friend rushes in, shoots the
bear, but it goes through the barons,

412
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:11,510
shatters his elbow,
so he gets shot in the fucking elbow.

413
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:16,250
The bear runs out of that 10 into
another 10 where this other guy shoots it

414
00:25:16,251 --> 00:25:20,240
three times with a shotgun and then
kills it. Wow. Where was this at?

415
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,990
Alaska first ever black bear.
Yeah.

416
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:28,120
First ever hunt is kids on and he wakes
up his head getting eaten by a 500 pound

417
00:25:29,331 --> 00:25:33,720
black bear. That's a bad
day. Fucking black bear too,

418
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:35,930
that you know, you gotta you
gotta you know, like a man.

419
00:25:35,931 --> 00:25:39,380
I hope I don't get bit by
a spider tonight. Injury.

420
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:45,420
It's a bear. Is Camping.
Stuff's pretty cool. We're out
here in nature getting one.

421
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:51,230
So biting your fucking head.
Ow. We, that's got to suck.

422
00:25:51,231 --> 00:25:53,990
I guess his head was like near the door.

423
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:55,940
I mean that's the only
thing I could think of.

424
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:59,900
His head was like near the door and he
left the, it'll get a little air in here,

425
00:25:59,901 --> 00:26:04,700
lip with the vestibule opened or whatever.
You know, it's dope. I never used one,

426
00:26:04,701 --> 00:26:07,680
but I think I would love it
is, um, you ever seen those uh,

427
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:11,530
campers that they have on top of
your roof? Like a tab that opened?

428
00:26:11,531 --> 00:26:12,690
Do you have one of those?
No,

429
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:16,140
I've got my truck set up with the camper
shell and then I've got a shelf in

430
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:18,870
there and I get it all
set up for traveling.

431
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:23,000
You use a Toyota land cruisers
that what you use? Um, in,

432
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:26,070
in New Zealand I use it at Toyota,
but uh, here I've got a full,

433
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:29,890
like a Ford f one 50. And if you
turn completely set it up just for,

434
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:33,330
for hunting and you can you sleep in it?
Yeah, I sleep, I can sleep in the back.

435
00:26:33,331 --> 00:26:36,930
So when I'm on the road I've got
like, uh, I've got the side open up,

436
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,280
it's like a camper shell on it and then
the side lifts up and I got a shelf in

437
00:26:41,281 --> 00:26:43,740
there,
was getting aggressive,

438
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:47,610
embarrassed,
got a,

439
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:51,240
got a shelf in there so I can kind of
sleep underneath and keep stuff up top.

440
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:54,960
And then, and then I've got roof
rack and the whole deal. Yeah,

441
00:26:54,961 --> 00:26:59,730
because when I first found out about you
was from that show solo hunter and you

442
00:26:59,731 --> 00:27:04,080
went on these cool adventures, I was
like, wow, that must be fucking fun to do.

443
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:05,940
So much because you're doing these,

444
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:10,410
these crazy hunts while you're
backpacking out, deep, deep,

445
00:27:10,411 --> 00:27:12,360
deep into the woods by yourself.

446
00:27:12,361 --> 00:27:16,990
And there's this real element of danger
to doing that because if you fall snap,

447
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:21,510
uh, an ankle or something like that, like,
man, there's no one to call does you?

448
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,420
Gotta you gotta get out of there on your
own. No one's going to find you. Right?

449
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:29,220
Like I remember that there was one episode
where you slept inside this ancient

450
00:27:29,221 --> 00:27:31,210
Indian structures,
ancient nature,

451
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:34,590
native American structure that you
found in Nevada. And I was like,

452
00:27:34,591 --> 00:27:37,920
dad has gotta be one of the fucking
coolest things you could ever do.

453
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:41,510
It was pretty cool. You know, you
find, I find all kinds of cool places.

454
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,070
There's a place in New Zealand and I
like to go now that I found it's just a

455
00:27:44,071 --> 00:27:46,770
rock and crawl under and sleep,
then you don't have to bring a tent.

456
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:50,820
You just got your sleeping
bag. That's your spot. You
Go, yeah, I like to go light.

457
00:27:50,821 --> 00:27:55,320
So I try to minimize the amount of things
that I have to bring. Um, because, um,

458
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:58,990
well for filming it, I'm
carrying so much shit. Yeah.

459
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:04,100
Two cameras and tripods and batteries and
by the time I add the essential stuff,

460
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:09,900
I'm like way over weight. Now when you do
that, when you do this and this show, uh,

461
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:12,990
this is a different show. It's
called Solo Hunter. When you do that,

462
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:17,620
you film everything. You film all,
you filmed the setup, you film the,

463
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:20,790
the actual shot.
You film yourself drawing back,

464
00:28:20,791 --> 00:28:23,460
you fill them all this different stuff.
Who Puts it all together?

465
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:28,470
You send it to Tim and Tim. Tim Burton it,
he puts it together. Do you call him up?

466
00:28:28,471 --> 00:28:31,520
And he's like, dude, you're editing sucks.
You missed it. My, my favorite course up.

467
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:32,251
Uh,
yeah,

468
00:28:32,251 --> 00:28:36,780
actually I do a picture of me looking
at whimsical out of the mountain an hour

469
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:40,410
getting that shot when I walked
for ridges over is four miles away.

470
00:28:40,411 --> 00:28:44,700
I used my entire battery. And you didn't
use it. Do you give him notes? Like,

471
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,530
like what I try to, yeah, we,

472
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,960
we just kinda fly by the seat of our pants
on that one sometimes. I mean it's uh,

473
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:55,000
yeah,
it was just kind of give him the footage.

474
00:28:55,001 --> 00:28:58,350
She sits down and watches everything,
which some of it is just ridiculous.

475
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:01,830
I think if he put together a montage of
just the ridiculous shit that I've said

476
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:04,630
films and he's like,
why did you do that?

477
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,600
This is one of my all time favorite shows.

478
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,390
One of the reason why is when
you're solo out there, you, you,

479
00:29:12,391 --> 00:29:17,190
there's a sense that you, you get like
that. Um, I feel like I'm with you.

480
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,800
Yeah. You know what I mean?
Like if you go hunting,

481
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:24,780
like if say if I'm on meat or something
like that, maybe it's because I know,

482
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:29,190
but it's like your v really aware that
Steve has a crew is a production crew.

483
00:29:29,191 --> 00:29:32,820
There's PA's, there's guys that are
carrying stuff, there's interns, there's,

484
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,550
you know,
like when we would go hunt,

485
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:39,900
they would be like two guys with cameras
that would be following us around. Yeah.

486
00:29:39,901 --> 00:29:42,300
That's the thing. Like when I'm by I, I

487
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,143
run,

488
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:46,660
the other thing I do is I
try to do everything like
what I call like live spine

489
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:47,301
livestream.

490
00:29:47,301 --> 00:29:51,820
So if it's more important for me to
get the footage of what's going on,

491
00:29:51,821 --> 00:29:55,930
then actually have things work
out I guess be successful.

492
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,153
And so,

493
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:01,330
I mean I've got two cameras and I tried
to set things up and it's really tough

494
00:30:01,331 --> 00:30:06,040
but it's so much, it's like you're
right there because there's no filter.

495
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:08,170
You see everything that's going on.

496
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,260
Like you might see a camera and a shot
and you might see this other stuff,

497
00:30:11,261 --> 00:30:15,110
but it's all like that's what it's like
to be out there by yourself. I guess

498
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:16,151
it's,

499
00:30:16,151 --> 00:30:20,830
there's this weird feeling of connection
to nature that you get on your show

500
00:30:20,831 --> 00:30:21,180
that I,

501
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:26,180
I don't think you get that in that depth
on other shows because I know you're by

502
00:30:26,321 --> 00:30:27,070
herself.

503
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:31,570
Like I feel like this sort of element of
solitude and kind of danger when you're,

504
00:30:31,571 --> 00:30:34,270
when you're, you're talking to the camera,
you just talking to yourself. Yeah.

505
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,133
And there's nobody there.

506
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:40,940
Tragic figure out how to sneak up on some
big bedded meal deer and you're trying

507
00:30:41,831 --> 00:30:44,470
to put it all together and at
the same time you're filming it,

508
00:30:44,471 --> 00:30:45,620
which has got to make it like twice.

509
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:49,270
Oh yeah, let's now it's like, I think
it's kind of one of those things.

510
00:30:49,271 --> 00:30:52,540
You hear a hunters that are maybe rifle
hunting and they get into bow hunting

511
00:30:52,541 --> 00:30:57,010
because of the challenge or whatever.
And then once I started filming things,

512
00:30:57,011 --> 00:31:01,450
I thought this is the challenge. Like
that's, it's so unbelievably hard,

513
00:31:01,451 --> 00:31:03,460
but it's,

514
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:08,670
for me it's exciting and fun and it's
a new element to add to the hunt.

515
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:11,920
Now. It's almost hard not to
like if I go out by myself,

516
00:31:11,921 --> 00:31:14,170
even if I know I'm not going to use
it for solo hunters or whatever,

517
00:31:14,171 --> 00:31:18,280
I still film it myself. I don't
know why. I always felt I do.

518
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:23,880
You're like a porn star, work
home with them. I mean, I,

519
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:27,520
there was 100 I did recently and
trying to get away from it just be,

520
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:31,660
just hunt more like I used
to. But um, I don't know.

521
00:31:31,661 --> 00:31:36,520
There's that element of feel like you
almost cheated it cause he didn't capture

522
00:31:36,521 --> 00:31:40,330
it or yeah, you just, it
became too, it not too easy,

523
00:31:40,331 --> 00:31:43,570
but it's like I could have you would go
back and think I could have filmed that.

524
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,870
You know what I saw recently?

525
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:49,900
Fuze has a stabilizer that you
put on your bow that is a camera.

526
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,910
Yeah. Have you ever used
one of those? No. Um,

527
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:56,630
some of the places I hunt it's illegal
to have electronic devices attached to

528
00:31:56,631 --> 00:32:00,140
the bow and, and for like, um,

529
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:04,040
I just refrain from putting
electronic equipment on my bow. Even.

530
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:06,230
I won't even put the Gopro,
like when I'm,

531
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:09,920
I might get a shot or two with the Gopro
on a boat depending on where I'm at.

532
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:14,080
But, uh, so it would be illegal
to have a Gopro on the bulb,

533
00:32:14,081 --> 00:32:18,230
but you could probably have it on your
head like tracker here some places

534
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:21,960
because it's not an, it's not
like an electronic Aina, a site.

535
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:27,230
I think a lot of states have rewritten
the definition because people wanted to

536
00:32:27,231 --> 00:32:30,830
put cameras and things on their
equipment, but you know, I dunno.

537
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:31,570
So would the,

538
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:35,980
the idea was that archery supposed
to be more difficult in any sort of

539
00:32:35,981 --> 00:32:39,080
electronic gadget that you would
add that would make it easier,

540
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:40,550
would be an unfair advantage

541
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:44,090
and it wouldn't make archery
season a little easier.

542
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,780
And archery season is supposed
to be tougher. Is that
the idea behind thing? So,

543
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:49,700
yeah. Well they would need to do
is to stop this crossbow shit.

544
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:52,790
Like you can't see using a
crossbow during archery season.

545
00:32:52,791 --> 00:32:55,070
There's tills a two totally
different things. Yeah.

546
00:32:55,071 --> 00:32:59,480
That's a recent more recent development.
Um, I might as well be a rifle.

547
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:03,380
Yeah. I mean it's a short range
rifle. I mean, you have a scope,

548
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:08,080
you could be arrested on something. I
mean, you could rest it on a tripod. Yeah.

549
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:10,580
Like a rifle like that.
To be honest though,

550
00:33:10,581 --> 00:33:15,230
I think most compound bows are a lot
more accurate and better than crossbows.

551
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:18,260
Really the ones that I've shot.
Yeah. That's interesting. Well,

552
00:33:18,261 --> 00:33:21,410
maybe it's because you're a really
good shot too. No, I mean I've,

553
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:24,620
I've taken guys out that it's,
I've never hunted with a crossbow,

554
00:33:24,621 --> 00:33:26,060
but not that I have anything against him,

555
00:33:26,061 --> 00:33:30,720
but I feel like they just weren't
as effective as a regular bow. Hmm.

556
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:35,350
Do you not watch the walking
dead? Oh, well in that case,
when you're hunting zone,

557
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:40,520
zombies and elk are completely
different for sure. A crossbow,

558
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,730
you know, it drives me nuts about
watching that on that show. I'm like,

559
00:33:43,731 --> 00:33:45,230
how is he not getting past throws?

560
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:49,400
He's shooting these mushy Zombie heads
and he could pull the Arrow out every

561
00:33:49,401 --> 00:33:53,630
time. Like that shit should be blowing
right to that machine. My question is,

562
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:56,180
how does the load, have you ever
tried pulling a crossbow back?

563
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:59,360
They're like 300 pound poll and
your fingers and get caught,

564
00:33:59,361 --> 00:34:02,930
so you need a special device
to drive across devices.

565
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:06,440
I think that would slow you down and
killing zombies. I think you're right.

566
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:09,500
It would be very, well I, they
never reloads on the fucking show.

567
00:34:09,501 --> 00:34:13,100
It's just always loaded. It's an
automatic crossbow, in which case,

568
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:15,080
superior weapon of choice.

569
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,130
I've seen one of them that
I saw recently had a, uh,

570
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:23,720
it had like these handles built into it
while you pull the handles out there on

571
00:34:23,721 --> 00:34:28,300
like draw strings and then you hook the
handles to the cord, the string that you,

572
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,880
and then you pull it back with that
and then latch, latch it in place.

573
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:36,200
But I was like, why would I do this? This
is not as good as a bow. And I was like,

574
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:39,230
well, not only that, I could put
another arrow in a bow, like, um,

575
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:42,460
when I shot my elk, I shot
it, I hit it once and then it,

576
00:34:42,461 --> 00:34:44,570
it didn't know what happened.
It blew right through it.

577
00:34:44,571 --> 00:34:46,940
It didn't even know we were there and
it was like, what the fuck is going on?

578
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:51,110
And within five seconds I had another
arrow on it. If it was a crossbow,

579
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:55,610
I would have been like, hold up, I
gotta get out. Get your crank out. Yeah,

580
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:58,340
those are cool. Like those old
ones that they used to have.

581
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:02,990
When you see like when they first invented
them and there was like a stick that

582
00:35:02,991 --> 00:35:06,260
was like a lever that was holding it
back and it worked on this sort of a

583
00:35:06,261 --> 00:35:10,520
locking mechanism and tunc and they
would shoot these bolts like in game of

584
00:35:10,521 --> 00:35:12,540
Thrones style, like those type of, yeah,

585
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:17,570
crossbows but even them that's
slower and slower than a regular.

586
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,150
I don't see him as if,
if you've ever tried to carry you,

587
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:21,890
it's not made for caring walking around.

588
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:26,030
But it's the most awkward
thing to carry on the planet.

589
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:30,210
Think of a gun that's got like a bow
going the opposite direction, you know,

590
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:33,410
it makes a giant, it's big too. Yeah,

591
00:35:33,411 --> 00:35:37,500
it's a big t e there's no effective way
to carry it. I think it's just, I dunno,

592
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,050
I dunno

593
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:38,250
do

594
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:39,430
he goes with me. Wow. Wow.

595
00:35:39,431 --> 00:35:44,431
How long before someone makes a crossbow
that a is an homage to Jesus or it's a

596
00:35:44,611 --> 00:35:48,210
big cross, an actual cross
cross bow in about, yeah,

597
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,150
so you could like he could,
after you've seen animal,

598
00:35:51,151 --> 00:35:54,690
you can put it in the ground and go
through the motions and there is,

599
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:58,500
there was one crop they've
got the crossbows can get
the most interesting names

600
00:35:58,501 --> 00:36:01,180
too because there was one
crossbow is called the penetrate

601
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:07,500
and then I can't buddy,
uh, me and my brother,

602
00:36:07,501 --> 00:36:10,620
a friend of ours is a photographer
and he needed some models to me and my

603
00:36:10,621 --> 00:36:13,860
brother went out and so my brother was
like the face of the zone. We were like,

604
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:15,600
oh man.
Hopefully it's the penetrator

605
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:20,790
he needed models first crossbow because
no one wanted to be the face of the

606
00:36:20,791 --> 00:36:21,624
penetrating.

607
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:27,450
The penetrator were fucking stupid
name. Yeah. They have to have new, well,

608
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:32,100
every time Bose come out, every year,
like Hoyt just came out with their new,

609
00:36:32,101 --> 00:36:36,540
a 2016 line of bows and they have
to come up with new names, you know,

610
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:41,450
but after a while you run on a fucking
verbs, you run on the adjectives,

611
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:45,690
you want to run out of letters to
combine together. Like, you know,

612
00:36:45,691 --> 00:36:50,520
what's a night drum? Nitrogen is
white night trim. What is that? I,

613
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:53,500
it's gotta be something awesome.
They're good.

614
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:58,470
Why don't they just call it the 2016
you know, that's not a bad, yeah,

615
00:36:58,471 --> 00:37:01,830
just like a truck. He'd seen me
same model, just different year

616
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:06,950
50 2016 F150 there's no confusion there.

617
00:37:06,951 --> 00:37:09,150
It's not the 2016 penetrator no,

618
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:12,090
I went to dominator compound bows.

619
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:16,540
Making compound bows is, you think it's
just like a bow? It's like a simple,

620
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,850
I dunno,
like a simple device.

621
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:23,920
Yet the amount of engineering that goes
into these bows is crazy. I went to this,

622
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:24,980
this deal.

623
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:29,020
A G five is like an archery company
and they also make these prime bows.

624
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:31,600
And I was,
I was talking,

625
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:36,070
one of the engineers was kind of going
over like what it takes to build about

626
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:41,020
and apparently you really can't build
two bows that are identical that shoot

627
00:37:41,021 --> 00:37:42,820
identical. Really? Yeah.

628
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:46,900
Because the tolerances would have to
be so minute and so kind of everybody's

629
00:37:46,901 --> 00:37:51,901
goal I think is to just build two bows
that are exact but they all the way,

630
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:53,560
because things are constantly moving,

631
00:37:53,561 --> 00:37:58,561
the limbs are flexing and the risers
are moving and everything is just,

632
00:37:58,781 --> 00:37:59,680
so it's,

633
00:37:59,681 --> 00:38:04,390
there's such a science behind
a simple tool like a a bow,

634
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:07,270
but when you start putting wheels and
cams and all kinds of things on it,

635
00:38:07,271 --> 00:38:10,330
just the amount of engineering
that goes into, it's insane.

636
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:10,711
Yeah.

637
00:38:10,711 --> 00:38:13,850
Well the people say that it'll change
based on what kind of strings you use.

638
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,960
Like if we switched to
winner's choice strings,

639
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:18,890
it's not like a real high
tolerance Strang and you know,

640
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:22,830
some people prefer the strings that it
comes with and guys we'll switch back and

641
00:38:22,831 --> 00:38:27,831
forth and adjust their draw length by a
quarter of an inch at a time and monkey

642
00:38:28,921 --> 00:38:31,740
around with geek out on that stuff
if you really want. So. Right.

643
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:36,040
I always just kind of uh,
get it how I like and

644
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:41,050
leave it alone. Yeah. Do you get a new bow
every year? I do. Yeah. That's the ice.

645
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:45,400
The problem, the worst. Well it's
so different than rifles. It is.

646
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:47,770
You get used to it.
It's something new.

647
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:52,420
If you have a 10 year old rifle that
things perfect. I've got, you can name it.

648
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:55,680
Yeah.
Betsy [inaudible] Hannah's bad rifle.

649
00:38:55,690 --> 00:38:58,450
You know the night drums
out the new ones in,

650
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:02,500
you know like fuck because new Bose come
out every year and they'll just have

651
00:39:02,501 --> 00:39:05,880
like just a little bit more power,
just a little bit more speed.

652
00:39:05,881 --> 00:39:07,270
It's a little bit more of this,
a little bit more.

653
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:12,580
It's like I can't imagine
needing in some ways you know,

654
00:39:12,581 --> 00:39:13,414
cause like,

655
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:18,690
like think of like a guy like Cam Haines
who kills like everything with a bow.

656
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:24,240
I mean he killed this year he killed I
think three elk or a moose to deer to

657
00:39:26,171 --> 00:39:30,820
grizzly bears to grizzly bears to
two black bears all with a bow. Wow.

658
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:34,020
All at the same bow. I mean
Devo obviously works. Yeah.

659
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:37,720
Like you don't need a new boat dude.
But the new ones come out. Pam,

660
00:39:37,721 --> 00:39:40,600
you got to get a new one and know he's
sponsored by Hoyt so they send them the

661
00:39:40,601 --> 00:39:44,530
new one right away and he's got to get
it tuned in and got to put the new site

662
00:39:44,531 --> 00:39:46,630
on. All of this new one is the thing.
This new one is that with that,

663
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:49,000
what's wrong with the old one? Do you
be killed? Everything with that old one,

664
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:53,370
but it's these extra few feet per second
that you can get with the new one. Yeah.

665
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:58,090
The extra, like the extra forgiveness
of the accuracy of the bow.

666
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:03,120
Like where it's a people who have never
shot like a compound bow have no idea.

667
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:05,620
Like how fun it is.

668
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:09,940
Like just shooting targets is
so like it's relaxing, it's fun.

669
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:14,080
It's a fun thing to do because you can't
be thinking about anything else. Yes,

670
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:14,741
exactly.

671
00:40:14,741 --> 00:40:17,620
I've noticed like if I'm out there and
I'm thinking about a lot of things,

672
00:40:17,621 --> 00:40:19,850
when you think about things,
your eyes drift, you know,

673
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,580
they always say when somebody is lying,

674
00:40:21,581 --> 00:40:23,260
their eyes move up into
the right or whatever.

675
00:40:23,261 --> 00:40:26,380
But when you're thinking it's the same
thing if you're thinking about your day's

676
00:40:26,381 --> 00:40:31,180
work and whatever your eyes shift and
then you aren't looking through the site.

677
00:40:31,181 --> 00:40:35,980
Right. And you, yeah. You
Miss. Yeah. Yeah. The, the,
all of the things when you're,

678
00:40:35,981 --> 00:40:38,710
when you're shooting a bow,
it's um,

679
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:42,910
it really is like a form of meditation
and a lot of ways where like for people

680
00:40:42,911 --> 00:40:45,310
that are listening to this,
if you have no desire ever to hunt,

681
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:50,290
you might be a vegetarian and no desire
to eat meat. Just try archery for fun.

682
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:53,110
You know, it is, is a really fun,

683
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:56,770
rewarding discipline
because it does something,

684
00:40:56,771 --> 00:41:01,771
it's like a form of meditation when you
were locked onto that site or locked

685
00:41:02,111 --> 00:41:03,760
onto that, um, target rather,

686
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:08,680
and everything has to be perfectly aligned
and then you release that Arrow and

687
00:41:08,681 --> 00:41:12,400
then it's sores and sunk right
into the bowls. Like, oh,

688
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:17,590
it's the most rewarding feelings. It's
weird as Boga. Yeah. Like, uh, yeah,

689
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:21,610
you gotta, you gotta be focused
and it's practice and it's a cool,

690
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:25,720
it's a cool sport. I think there's
something in our DNA with archery too.

691
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,340
I really think there's something,

692
00:41:27,341 --> 00:41:32,200
because for thousands of years that
was the best weapon that people had for

693
00:41:32,201 --> 00:41:34,190
hunting.
And I think those people

694
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:38,110
survived and they survived
by hunting with a bow. Yeah.

695
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:43,190
So I think every human being that's alive
has in the echo of that DNA in their

696
00:41:43,641 --> 00:41:44,360
system,

697
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:49,010
the echo of the memories of the people
that survived by airwing a deer and then

698
00:41:49,011 --> 00:41:52,280
the whole family got to eat,
you know? Whereas if you didn't,

699
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:54,590
you didn't fucking eat. I
mean, and when they were,

700
00:41:54,591 --> 00:41:57,230
when bows were the only
things that you had,

701
00:41:57,590 --> 00:42:01,850
the feeling that they must have had when
they were trying to survive thousands

702
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:05,090
of years before anybody even bothered
writing things down and they release that

703
00:42:05,091 --> 00:42:05,521
Arrow in,

704
00:42:05,521 --> 00:42:09,170
it's right into the heart of an animal
and you knew where you were eating,

705
00:42:09,171 --> 00:42:12,770
now you're probably fucking starving
when you shot it. You know? I mean,

706
00:42:12,771 --> 00:42:14,300
I think that's in our system.

707
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:18,500
I think even if you don't want to hunt
and you have no desire to kill an animal

708
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:22,940
there, it's, it's way better
than shooting. Like if
you shoot a three pointer,

709
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:27,500
I mean it's Kinda cool, but it's nothing
like an Arrow going into a target.

710
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:32,140
It's accentuated like
multi times multifold for,

711
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:33,140
for whatever reason,

712
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:36,010
when I first started shooting a bow,

713
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:38,850
I was just a kid and I didn't
know anybody that had bows,

714
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:42,780
but I'd watch this guys and he was buyer
in Ferguson and his whole thing was

715
00:42:42,781 --> 00:42:46,440
just be the Arrow, instinctive
shooting. It was just a long though.

716
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,400
And what I mean there,
it was the best.

717
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:53,220
It was the only advice that I had
to shoot a bow with be the air.

718
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:56,370
What's that mean?
Cause a child be the air.

719
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,870
But I would go out in the backyard
and he was a trick shooter.

720
00:42:58,871 --> 00:43:03,540
He'd throw ring up and shoot through
the ring and she'd like aspirin off his

721
00:43:03,541 --> 00:43:06,310
wife's head. I don't know,
not off her head but like,

722
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:10,200
like throw up aspirin and at
me often it's aspirin. Yeah.

723
00:43:10,201 --> 00:43:12,950
He would actually shouldn't asprin
in the year with an error. Yeah.

724
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:15,480
I think the guy has to be one
of the best shots in the world.

725
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:18,240
Wow.
And it was a with a recurve or a longbow.

726
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:21,350
Wow. But his, his,

727
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:25,700
his philosophy is just be the
era. Just shoot how, how it feels.

728
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:28,590
Don't kind of make sense.
If you get to a certain point,

729
00:43:28,591 --> 00:43:31,920
I guess probably a tennis player must
get to that point to where you have the

730
00:43:31,921 --> 00:43:36,390
same racket for so long and you know the
weight of a ball and you know, you just,

731
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:40,520
you kind of know where the ball's gone
because you hit it so many times if just

732
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:44,710
you've done that motion so many times
that like if you watch like Roger Federer

733
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:45,990
or some of the great tennis players,

734
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:49,300
they must have like a feel
for where that ball's going.

735
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:53,820
That's that far surpasses what a guy like
me would never plays tennis could ever

736
00:43:53,821 --> 00:43:54,660
be able to understand.

737
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:55,140
Yeah.

738
00:43:55,140 --> 00:44:00,140
Because I think there's a certain point
where your brain doesn't work fast

739
00:44:00,211 --> 00:44:03,150
enough for the situation.
So that's where our instincts kick in.

740
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:07,740
Whenever we get to a situation
that our brain can't compute,

741
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:11,040
you can't compute the speed that that
aspirin is going in the air and the speed

742
00:44:11,041 --> 00:44:15,210
of your Arrow and the pull of your boat.
You just have to feel what's right.

743
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:18,660
Yeah. That data has to already
be inside you. Right. Well,

744
00:44:18,661 --> 00:44:22,650
that's the thing about
instinctive shooting with a
bow that doesn't have a site

745
00:44:22,890 --> 00:44:27,600
like a long bar recurve. They just kind
of know where the arrows gone. They don't,

746
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:31,620
they're not range finding these I that
that's gotta be weird cause you've got to

747
00:44:31,621 --> 00:44:34,590
use the same weight arrows
over and over and over again.

748
00:44:34,591 --> 00:44:38,880
And if you really using traditional
equipment, you're using wooden arrows.

749
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:41,680
So if you're using consistent,
very inconsistent, you know,

750
00:44:41,681 --> 00:44:45,870
and they could vary by several
grams each arrow and that,

751
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:49,530
that's a big difference in how far it's
going to fly, how it's going to fly.

752
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:53,160
Can't really reuse the arrows two
months or the, the blades get dull,

753
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:57,000
the feathers get fucked up. Yeah. It's um,

754
00:44:57,030 --> 00:45:01,590
you seen that guy on youtube that does
all that crazy archery trick shot stuff

755
00:45:01,591 --> 00:45:06,060
and he carries the, the uh, arrows in
his fingers. No, he never seen him.

756
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:11,430
The dude can shoot like three times
in the air before it hits the ground.

757
00:45:11,431 --> 00:45:15,060
Like he'll jump off something
and go, hey, can shoot. Like he,

758
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:20,320
he holds the arrows in his fingers and
some people tried to do this credit him,

759
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:24,690
I've watched the discrediting him
and I think they're fucking bitter.

760
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:29,700
I think they're jealous. Good. What
he's doing is fucking amazing. I mean,

761
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:33,900
w w unless he's using
CGI and faking all of it,

762
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:37,830
what he's doing is amazing and I think
these bitter bitches need to just get

763
00:45:37,831 --> 00:45:40,380
their own attention some other way.
But they're there.

764
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:45,680
What he's done is he's found a way to
mimic what he believes is the ancient way

765
00:45:46,321 --> 00:45:47,460
of holding arrows.

766
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:52,080
He believes they held them
in their fingers and then
they would just be able to

767
00:45:52,081 --> 00:45:55,980
reload like really quickly. They
develop like very good finger dexterity,

768
00:45:55,981 --> 00:45:59,760
whereas we always think of it as like a
quiver and your reach back pulling out

769
00:45:59,761 --> 00:46:01,860
of the quiver. And he's like,
that takes too much time.

770
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:07,110
And he thinks that this is the guy like
check this shit out. Like, watch this.

771
00:46:08,190 --> 00:46:12,910
Like, watch how he's
holding it. Like that is a,

772
00:46:12,911 --> 00:46:17,890
that's one where he's just
got it. Oh, he's throwing a
fucking, uh, a tab of a beer

773
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:20,500
and hitting it.

774
00:46:24,590 --> 00:46:28,280
But he's, he does a lot
of jumping. First of all,

775
00:46:28,281 --> 00:46:31,040
this guy looks like he's
never even heard a pussy.

776
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:36,950
That was his favorite clip. He's like, I
shot the head off a plastic barrier. Yeah.

777
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:41,900
Well he's um, he, he throws his bow in the
air and you could do it really quickly.

778
00:46:41,901 --> 00:46:45,980
These are not as impressive as the ones
where you holds multiple arrows in his

779
00:46:45,981 --> 00:46:49,970
hands. But it is pretty cool.
Pretty cool. He can do it.

780
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:53,900
He can do it in the right
hand or the left hand. Um, but

781
00:46:55,870 --> 00:46:58,040
it was broken in the right hand
and the left hand like this is,

782
00:46:58,180 --> 00:47:02,380
you can't disprove this. I mean, this
is, this guy is actually a very ag, oh,

783
00:47:02,381 --> 00:47:05,720
here's one where he's got multiple arrows.
He's got two arrows in his hand.

784
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:10,680
Wash this one too. Oh God. Oh,

785
00:47:10,681 --> 00:47:13,020
that's a different one. That
was one. He sliced a, uh,

786
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:14,870
an arrow in half of the knife.

787
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:20,630
I think it grabs the Arrow and
shoots it before he hits the ground.

788
00:47:21,650 --> 00:47:25,330
Don't try this at home. He's catching
owls. Oh, he's got a weak ass bow.

789
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:29,410
Child's Beau.
He does.

790
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:32,170
He does all this crazy
trick shots and see there,

791
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:36,700
there you see him holding multiple
arrows in between his fingers.

792
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:41,500
His name is Lars something other. It's
pretty accurate too. It looks like.

793
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:45,280
Yeah, very accurate. See, look at
that. See how he's holding them.

794
00:47:45,610 --> 00:47:47,470
He's having drinks with people
and shooting them in the face.

795
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:50,320
He's imagining himself in the old west.
See this is,

796
00:47:50,321 --> 00:47:54,220
this is their arrows and a quiver and
now look, he holds them in his hand,

797
00:47:55,990 --> 00:48:00,070
but now this is his style
and the draw hand. See,

798
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:03,130
see how they used to do that.
Like these are some ancient hieroglyphs.

799
00:48:03,131 --> 00:48:05,020
They showed some ancient photos.

800
00:48:05,021 --> 00:48:08,290
They showed them holding the
arrows in their hands as they shot.

801
00:48:08,650 --> 00:48:13,650
And so he's trying to recapture
this old way of doing archery.

802
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:17,650
That's cool. Yeah. Archery's
fascinating man. It's uh,

803
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:22,450
it's just a fascinating thing that someone
figured out a long time ago that you

804
00:48:22,451 --> 00:48:26,590
could attach a string to a stick
and if you pull that stick back,

805
00:48:26,591 --> 00:48:30,370
it's got energy that goes, throws it,
wants it to go back the way it came.

806
00:48:30,371 --> 00:48:34,390
And if you put another stick on
that string, he can kill some shit.

807
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:36,360
Yeah,
that's it.

808
00:48:36,870 --> 00:48:40,260
It's been around for a long
time and it's effective still.

809
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:45,230
Yeah. Well guys like Cam Haynes, he
uh, you know, he only hunts with,

810
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:49,200
with a bow and he's like a rifle on.
He's just not fun. Like I don't enjoy it.

811
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:53,160
He was like, I have to get the,
I, I've, I can be really far away.

812
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:56,970
Barely see the thing, lay
it on a rock, look to scope,

813
00:48:56,971 --> 00:48:59,650
squeeze the trigger in the animal's
dead. He's like, it's just the,

814
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:04,660
the amount of thrill and the amount of
skill involved is just so much less that

815
00:49:04,831 --> 00:49:07,230
for him it's just,
it's not worth doing.

816
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:12,690
Yeah. I enjoy bow hunting a lot and I also
enjoy rifle hunting though. I'd still,

817
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:14,710
I kind of didn't rifle
hunt for a long time.

818
00:49:14,711 --> 00:49:17,620
And then once I started filming
my own hunts, I was like, hm.

819
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:21,400
I might just pick up this rifle and make
it. And it's just as hard as, I mean,

820
00:49:21,490 --> 00:49:25,530
it depends where you're hunting too.
Cause when I go on a rifle hunting,

821
00:49:25,531 --> 00:49:29,110
a lot of times I'm going into a
place that is so hard to hunt.

822
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:32,260
Even sometimes just getting
there is a challenge.

823
00:49:32,290 --> 00:49:37,060
And then finding one animal is a challenge
and then getting to where you could

824
00:49:37,061 --> 00:49:39,760
shoot that animal and they're
taking it with a rifle.

825
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:41,880
And I've been on a lot of bow hunts there,

826
00:49:41,890 --> 00:49:45,220
a thousand times easier than many
of the rifle hands I've done.

827
00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:48,410
So there's kind of a,

828
00:49:48,411 --> 00:49:51,520
a thought where a lot of times
I'll go on a hunt and take a rifle.

829
00:49:51,550 --> 00:49:55,090
Not because it makes
it easier or it might,

830
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:59,320
it wouldn't be impossible with
a bow, but it's, it's just,

831
00:49:59,410 --> 00:50:03,130
it's so challenging in the first place
that the challenge is there. Well,

832
00:50:03,131 --> 00:50:05,710
you're doing it in a completely different
way than anybody else because as you

833
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:09,230
said, you're, you're filming.
Yeah. I mean there's,

834
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:13,780
there's other hunts where I've
gone on and I haven't, you know,

835
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:15,250
or I might not be filming,

836
00:50:15,251 --> 00:50:19,360
but you go into an area with such a low
densities that you might have to walk a

837
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:20,980
hundred miles before you
even see an animal. Well,

838
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,300
that was one of the episodes you
did recently was a deer hunt. Yeah.

839
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:29,640
You went on purpose to low density
area. Yeah. Just because I,

840
00:50:30,270 --> 00:50:32,690
I was thinking no one else is going here,

841
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:35,510
so that's why you weren't just cause
you knew you were going to be alone and

842
00:50:35,511 --> 00:50:37,070
it's going to be hard. And I thought, no,

843
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:38,720
I'll just stick it out
and see what happens.

844
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:42,470
There's one episode of Rinella show
where he went elk hunting and everywhere

845
00:50:42,471 --> 00:50:43,670
they looked,
there was hunters.

846
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:47,210
There's was like orange vests coming
up this hill going down that hill,

847
00:50:47,211 --> 00:50:51,590
going towards these elk and
like, wow, that's a, that's
a drag for two reasons. One,

848
00:50:51,770 --> 00:50:53,420
because it's kind of like,

849
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:57,890
it becomes a competitive race to try
to get to the elk first. But also too,

850
00:50:58,110 --> 00:51:02,840
you don't know these guys. You don't
know what, what they're doing. They know.

851
00:51:03,110 --> 00:51:07,670
You don't know like how, how squeezy
they are, how trigger happy they are.

852
00:51:07,790 --> 00:51:11,000
You know, like some guy
got shot this year, uh,

853
00:51:11,001 --> 00:51:15,290
elk hunting with a bow in the leg or
some guy who was stuck in for an elk.

854
00:51:15,710 --> 00:51:19,400
That's bad. That's terrible. If
you mistake someone with a bow.

855
00:51:20,350 --> 00:51:22,250
Yeah.
Like what the fuck man,

856
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:27,920
that guys is shooting at every
there that that's not normal.

857
00:51:28,310 --> 00:51:31,430
No, no. But with a rifle it would be like,

858
00:51:31,550 --> 00:51:36,110
a lot of weird shit can happen with
people shooting shot. They shouldn't make,

859
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:38,900
they don't know what's behind the
animal. They didn't, you know,

860
00:51:38,901 --> 00:51:41,770
they just take a chance to
take a flyer and you know,

861
00:51:41,830 --> 00:51:46,830
it's just when you have to take into
account other people's ideas of safety and

862
00:51:46,971 --> 00:51:48,470
you have to take that into consideration.

863
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:50,960
It kind of ruins the whole idea of honey.
Yeah.

864
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:54,770
I like hunting animals that are
acting as animals and not as animals.

865
00:51:54,771 --> 00:51:57,800
They're acting as hunted animals.
I guess because it was too different.

866
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:02,780
It's a little more predictable
in one sense, but you're,

867
00:52:02,781 --> 00:52:06,770
you're in a natural environment
hunting an animal as the animal exists.

868
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:09,530
And that to me is what it's all about.

869
00:52:09,890 --> 00:52:14,720
I like to be out there a lot of times by
myself and not see another person. Yeah.

870
00:52:14,721 --> 00:52:15,380
There's,

871
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:19,880
there is a big difference between the
way animals act when they're not hunted

872
00:52:20,330 --> 00:52:24,800
around people. And, uh, like
I was in boulder and uh,

873
00:52:24,830 --> 00:52:27,950
my wife and I were visiting this house,

874
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:29,900
visiting these people and uh,

875
00:52:29,901 --> 00:52:34,901
we went into the backyard and this
fucking giant mule deer in velvet is just

876
00:52:35,031 --> 00:52:38,870
walking straight towards us,
just straight towards us. And,

877
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:42,500
and my wife's like, do you want, would
you want to shoot that deer? I like,

878
00:52:42,501 --> 00:52:46,400
I could never shoot that
deer. It's just dog, a pet.

879
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:49,340
That thing's coming right towards us.
Like it wasn't even a little,

880
00:52:49,341 --> 00:52:52,280
a little nervous. It was just
walking like this did it, but up.

881
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:55,970
But looking at us right in the eye,
a big ass 10 pointer.

882
00:52:56,150 --> 00:53:00,830
I got big old mule deer too. He didn't, he
was like, he's been in his town forever.

883
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:04,220
This is my town. Bitch. People
aren't predators to him at all.

884
00:53:04,490 --> 00:53:07,670
It's actually probably a food source. She
sees people when they throw apples out,

885
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:11,510
probably. Yeah. We, uh, at
one point in time we pulled
over the side of the road. Um,

886
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:14,900
my girls had never seen it.
They've seen deers in our yard before,

887
00:53:15,050 --> 00:53:19,610
but they never seen like a big buck to
standing on the side of the road. And, uh,

888
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:22,580
we pulled over to the side of the road
and we got out of the car and I said,

889
00:53:22,610 --> 00:53:24,950
well, I just want you to stay
close to them because I don't,

890
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:27,810
he'll do anything but just in case we'll
stay on this side of the road and he'll

891
00:53:27,811 --> 00:53:30,360
be on the other side.
We're just separated by the road.

892
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:35,250
And he's just looking at us and just goes
back to just looking at us and they're

893
00:53:35,251 --> 00:53:40,230
like, that's so cool. And he was like,
what the fuck? They bolted and he's like,

894
00:53:40,231 --> 00:53:42,600
I don't know what that noise is.
It sounds like a war cry.

895
00:53:42,990 --> 00:53:46,290
Let me get out of here as a five year
old. What's it kill me? But it's just,

896
00:53:46,291 --> 00:53:49,680
it's so strange when you see them when
they're around people because they become

897
00:53:49,681 --> 00:53:52,440
like squirrels, you know, they
just, they just sort of hang out.

898
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:56,330
Yeah. Yeah. They, I dunno. For me,

899
00:53:56,930 --> 00:54:01,550
part of hunting is just being in
that place that's remote and wild and

900
00:54:01,551 --> 00:54:06,551
adventurous and a way to get away and
either by yourself and be in nature and

901
00:54:08,270 --> 00:54:12,080
so, I mean obviously there's places
that you hunt that are closer,

902
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:16,430
but also I think my thing is just kind
of going to places that aren't private

903
00:54:16,431 --> 00:54:20,570
ranches that aren't just real wild places
and going in there and working hard

904
00:54:20,571 --> 00:54:23,870
and trying to hunt animals
that may not have seen people.

905
00:54:24,250 --> 00:54:28,150
Yeah. When you see something hasn't seen
a person or when there's just no people

906
00:54:28,151 --> 00:54:31,270
around. There's this weird
moment when you, when you,

907
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:36,300
when you lock eyes on them and you're
seeing them and you don't have to exist.

908
00:54:36,730 --> 00:54:38,660
You, you, you, you mean? Yeah.

909
00:54:38,690 --> 00:54:42,760
They would be doing exactly that same
thing whether or not you were ever born

910
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:47,110
and you enter into their world
and it's this, it's a very weird,

911
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:51,760
I want to say like a transcendent
experience because you're in the wild,

912
00:54:51,790 --> 00:54:55,390
you're in the real wild and you get
the sense of that, that these animals,

913
00:54:55,391 --> 00:55:00,160
they live there and they
lived there looking out for
wolves or bears or whatever

914
00:55:00,161 --> 00:55:03,440
the fuck they're, they're worried about.
It's not people they're worried about.

915
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:06,010
Yeah.
I think it's cool too because you see,

916
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:09,430
you see a different landscape
than everybody else sees
because like when you're

917
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:11,020
hunting,
you're never on a trail.

918
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:16,150
You're going cross country through places
that someone else would never have a

919
00:55:16,151 --> 00:55:18,370
reason to be there,
you know?

920
00:55:18,371 --> 00:55:21,130
So those have been a lot of places that
I've been in, sat down and thought,

921
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:23,740
I wonder if anybody else has ever
even been right here. I mean,

922
00:55:23,741 --> 00:55:27,070
maybe they've been in this area, but
have, has anyone ever been right here?

923
00:55:27,071 --> 00:55:30,970
And why would they be here if
they weren't hunting? But I was,

924
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:32,650
I was actually thinking
about this the other day.

925
00:55:32,651 --> 00:55:37,651
I was in a spot when time I
backpacked in just had camping out.

926
00:55:39,190 --> 00:55:43,690
Extremely remote place to start off.
Hiked in along ways? No, he was right.

927
00:55:43,691 --> 00:55:48,130
It was that thought like there's probably
nobody has been here and I set up camp

928
00:55:48,131 --> 00:55:52,210
for the night and I had a bag of
potato chips and I'm like, okay,

929
00:55:52,270 --> 00:55:55,150
we need these chips, open up the
chips and it's starting to get dark.

930
00:55:55,150 --> 00:55:58,360
He to chip and I dropped one on the
ground and I'm setting up my tent and

931
00:55:58,361 --> 00:56:02,710
amounts runs out and grabs the
potato chip and starts eating it.

932
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:05,870
How does that mouse know
that it can eat potato chips?

933
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:09,490
That has perplexed me till this day.

934
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:14,520
Like is that mouse born knowing
that it can eat peanut oil,

935
00:56:14,951 --> 00:56:19,390
fried potato chips? That's a
really good question. I I it it,

936
00:56:19,630 --> 00:56:22,060
it's beyond like I can't figure that out.

937
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:25,960
I would think that would be a risk for
them. I would think so too. Or how,

938
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:29,980
why would it even think that that was
food? Because I was eating, it was like,

939
00:56:30,310 --> 00:56:33,920
this isn't like in in the middle of
nowhere and eating a bag of potato chips

940
00:56:33,921 --> 00:56:36,670
going here. These are some
energy. This isn't bad,

941
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:42,280
but it's not natural looking food.
It doesn't taste natural.

942
00:56:42,430 --> 00:56:44,700
It probably doesn't smell
like anything. Woods. No,

943
00:56:44,710 --> 00:56:47,920
and I'm thinking this mouse has
definitely never had human contact.

944
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:52,530
Like if you're in a town or something and
I would just, yeah, Paige and z thing.

945
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:55,690
They know it's food.
They've seen other animals eat that food.

946
00:56:55,691 --> 00:56:58,450
How did this mouse know that it can eat,
eat potato chips?

947
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:01,480
That's a very good question.
I would like to talk to a mouse x,

948
00:57:01,490 --> 00:57:04,390
but I want to do something.
I mean they do enough studies on them.

949
00:57:04,391 --> 00:57:08,200
I'm sure there's one out there. Yeah.
I wonder if the, maybe it's a salt.

950
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:10,530
Maybe they could smell the
salt. I Dunno. You know,

951
00:57:10,570 --> 00:57:13,330
cause I know animals gravitate
towards those salt blocks.

952
00:57:13,331 --> 00:57:17,720
Those don't make any sense. Yeah. They
leave leave down for deer. They need to,

953
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:21,340
maybe that's what it is. Maybe you just
recognizes the fact that salts on it.

954
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:24,220
They could probably smell the salt.
That's what I was thinking.

955
00:57:24,221 --> 00:57:29,110
Cause I did recently for
a new apex episode, um,

956
00:57:29,410 --> 00:57:34,310
a foraging thing, just going
out and finding foods, uh,

957
00:57:34,330 --> 00:57:38,860
much like a bare wood, but I,
I'm trying to think as a human,

958
00:57:38,861 --> 00:57:43,861
do we really have that innate ability
to distinguish poisonous plants from non

959
00:57:44,651 --> 00:57:48,850
poisonous plants? Not really. Not really,
but I don't know. Is it something,

960
00:57:48,851 --> 00:57:52,870
maybe it's passed down or if you
were just left on an island alone,

961
00:57:53,110 --> 00:57:56,170
would you figure out what you could eat?
Boy,

962
00:57:56,290 --> 00:57:59,260
you'd have to be fucking real careful
with things like mushrooms. Yeah.

963
00:57:59,261 --> 00:58:03,580
So that was one of the cool things that
I learned is there's actually way more

964
00:58:03,910 --> 00:58:07,300
poisonous plants then there are
poisonous mushrooms. Really? Yeah.

965
00:58:07,330 --> 00:58:09,370
Well there's a lot more plants I guess.

966
00:58:09,610 --> 00:58:12,070
But I mean for the amount of
edible plants that there are,

967
00:58:12,071 --> 00:58:14,380
there's a lot more
plants that are inedible.

968
00:58:14,381 --> 00:58:19,030
So the percentage of plants being
poisonous is higher than the percentage of

969
00:58:19,031 --> 00:58:20,080
mushrooms being poisonous.

970
00:58:22,870 --> 00:58:26,440
This was coming from a guy who's like
a mushroom expert and that's what his

971
00:58:26,441 --> 00:58:30,810
pitch was. He was like a pro mushroom.
Yeah. I think he's real premise,

972
00:58:30,811 --> 00:58:34,960
much like forward. Yeah.
But uh, yeah, there was,

973
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:37,510
there's actually a lot there. I think
there's a lot of mushrooms that yeah.

974
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:38,500
Will kill you dead.

975
00:58:38,501 --> 00:58:40,360
And then there's some that will make
you sick and then there's some that are

976
00:58:40,361 --> 00:58:42,610
just, you can't really eat. And
then there's some you can't eat.

977
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:45,540
There's a few though that are pretty
common. That'll kill you dead. Yeah.

978
00:58:46,130 --> 00:58:47,830
That's very disconcerting.
It is.

979
00:58:47,930 --> 00:58:51,610
But I think there's a lot of plants that
will kill you. Dead to a lot of berries.

980
00:58:52,090 --> 00:58:55,630
Oh yeah. I'm sure. Yeah. Yeah. I don't
know shit about plants that you can eat.

981
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:58,330
If I was left alone in the woods
and I had to figure out what to eat,

982
00:58:58,331 --> 00:59:00,880
I'd be fucked.
There's a lot of basics.

983
00:59:01,270 --> 00:59:04,990
You learn like 10 basics that are kind
of everywhere. Like what are the basics?

984
00:59:05,650 --> 00:59:08,460
You've got like cat tails and dandy line,

985
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:11,110
like just common plants
that are [inaudible] things.

986
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:16,360
My grandmother used to make
salad chicken. You, um, violets,

987
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:21,010
violets, like the rose, like a flower
rather. Yeah. You can eat those plants,

988
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:22,190
everything.
Um,

989
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:23,031
you probably wouldn't do it,

990
00:59:23,031 --> 00:59:26,870
one of those flowers on it so
you can identify it easily. Oh,

991
00:59:26,871 --> 00:59:29,790
you want to do a lot as flowers on
it? Um, unless you know what though,

992
00:59:30,110 --> 00:59:34,040
there's a lot of lookalikes plantation,
which is just kind of like a roadside.

993
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:36,020
I mean, he's all over
the place. It's not like,

994
00:59:36,021 --> 00:59:40,090
not like playing tanes but it's a plant.
It's called plantation,

995
00:59:40,130 --> 00:59:43,070
but it's not like a banana,
right? Correct. Yeah. Yeah.

996
00:59:43,071 --> 00:59:48,071
I watched that survivor man show Les
Stroud and he would go and he's a real

997
00:59:48,201 --> 00:59:51,290
expert in what you can and can't eat.
And shockingly,

998
00:59:51,291 --> 00:59:54,230
how little you could find
shocking. Yeah, that's,

999
00:59:54,370 --> 00:59:59,370
that's kind of the thing
that struck me is as a human,

1000
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:04,280
like a bear when they were plants,
they die off in the winter.

1001
01:00:04,370 --> 01:00:07,970
So then what do you eat? Like I
think a lot of people, I, I've,

1002
01:00:07,971 --> 01:00:12,710
I've heard people say like, oh, humans,
our digestive system is more plant based,

1003
01:00:12,711 --> 01:00:17,711
which we were opportunistic omnivores
as well as predatory omnivores.

1004
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:22,430
But once that plant base runs out,

1005
01:00:22,431 --> 01:00:25,820
we can't digest the same things dear Ken.
So what are we left too?

1006
01:00:25,821 --> 01:00:27,800
We have to hunt essentially.
Well,

1007
01:00:27,830 --> 01:00:32,830
when people say that that we primarily
exist on plant based diets or that we

1008
01:00:32,931 --> 01:00:34,480
can,
or should they,

1009
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:38,210
they don't take into account things like
Inuits who don't have any cancer at all.

1010
01:00:38,780 --> 01:00:43,460
They don't eat any vegetables, no
fruits, nothing. So lots of seal.

1011
01:00:43,550 --> 01:00:44,750
Yeah.
Fats.

1012
01:00:45,090 --> 01:00:49,850
They eat fats and fishes and
wail and anything they can kill.

1013
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:54,350
I mean that's a, that throws a big monkey
wrench into that whole theory. I don't,

1014
01:00:54,470 --> 01:00:57,470
I don't buy that because I think too much
of that. When people say those things,

1015
01:00:57,480 --> 01:01:01,520
it's ideologically based.
Whether people say, you know,

1016
01:01:01,521 --> 01:01:05,390
you should own like people that are like,
I don't need vegetables. I eat all meat.

1017
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:09,320
I think that's ridiculous when people
say that because I think vegetables

1018
01:01:09,321 --> 01:01:10,640
without a doubt,
a really good for you.

1019
01:01:10,970 --> 01:01:13,940
I feel better when I eat a
lot of vegetables. I think
it's really good for you,

1020
01:01:14,270 --> 01:01:18,480
but when people say that you
should only eat vegetables, I go,

1021
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:21,410
but that doesn't make any sense
either because that's not,

1022
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:24,290
that's not evidence based.
That's ideologically based.

1023
01:01:24,310 --> 01:01:27,740
It's like there's a good balance.
Yeah. But people that say that,

1024
01:01:27,741 --> 01:01:29,570
they're almost always
like animal rights people.

1025
01:01:29,780 --> 01:01:31,910
They're almost always vegan
and they're almost always,

1026
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:35,210
you're like really into animals and
the idea that we don't have to consume

1027
01:01:35,211 --> 01:01:38,720
animals, which I kind of see what
you're, I see what you're saying.

1028
01:01:38,721 --> 01:01:40,070
I don't agree with it,
but I see what you're saying.

1029
01:01:40,071 --> 01:01:42,110
But when you say that it's healthier,

1030
01:01:42,111 --> 01:01:47,080
it's better for people or
it's an ideological, you know,

1031
01:01:47,090 --> 01:01:51,590
it doesn't, that doesn't make sense.
Like logically know on either side.

1032
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:54,860
I mean, we can't just
eat, well we can, but can.

1033
01:01:54,950 --> 01:01:59,420
Eating only meat and eating like
omnivores, we should eat both.

1034
01:01:59,421 --> 01:02:04,100
But I mean, my personal belief is that
we should hunt for the meat that we eat.

1035
01:02:04,340 --> 01:02:08,150
And not everyone can do that, but it's
just, for me, it's a more natural system.

1036
01:02:08,151 --> 01:02:10,490
It makes more sense to me. That
is the real problem, right?

1037
01:02:10,491 --> 01:02:11,840
Because not everyone can do it.

1038
01:02:12,110 --> 01:02:16,040
The real problem is we've fucked
ourselves in this position,

1039
01:02:16,041 --> 01:02:19,620
literally fucked ourselves into this
position where we have 20 million people

1040
01:02:19,621 --> 01:02:21,180
jammed into a city. Right? I mean,

1041
01:02:21,181 --> 01:02:24,090
that's what we did and we fucked
until we ran out of space.

1042
01:02:24,270 --> 01:02:27,450
And now we have all these people piled
up and we have to keep trucking food into

1043
01:02:27,451 --> 01:02:32,400
this fuck festival that we call cities.
And no one's growing anything. I mean,

1044
01:02:32,401 --> 01:02:37,280
we have these goddamned giant chunks
of property that people are, you know,

1045
01:02:37,950 --> 01:02:39,240
packed into an apartment,

1046
01:02:39,241 --> 01:02:44,241
buildings and houses and fucking roads
and no one's growing a goddamn thing.

1047
01:02:44,430 --> 01:02:48,180
And there, there's so many ornamental
plants that have no utility.

1048
01:02:49,650 --> 01:02:52,930
What did we just replaced? Every plant
you couldn't eat with a plant. You could,

1049
01:02:52,970 --> 01:02:57,810
yeah, palm trees. Fucking palm
tree has those, those do fruit.

1050
01:02:57,811 --> 01:03:01,270
But we, they cut them off.
We don't want anybody dying.

1051
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:04,420
Do you know 150 people die every year
because coconuts fall on their head.

1052
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:09,270
That's, that's a bad day.
All across the world.

1053
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:14,480
150 people worldwide a
year from coconuts bonk.

1054
01:03:15,690 --> 01:03:20,670
Larry would be with us today.
Horrible coconut accident.
Well, you gotta think man,

1055
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:23,580
a full coconut. Like I bought one
the other day from supermarket.

1056
01:03:23,820 --> 01:03:28,320
And when you got, when you, for people
who've never seen a coconut in the wild,

1057
01:03:28,710 --> 01:03:31,420
when you're buying them
from a supermarket, they've
already been husked. Yeah,

1058
01:03:31,710 --> 01:03:35,370
like so a you're getting
the inside the outside is,

1059
01:03:35,371 --> 01:03:40,371
is hard sort of a husk that makes it
quite a bit heavier and you got to chop

1060
01:03:40,561 --> 01:03:44,040
through all that to get to the round
brown piece and you chop through that and

1061
01:03:44,041 --> 01:03:48,600
that's how you get the milk and the
fruit, the coconut, a white stuff itself.

1062
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:51,720
But with one of those falls from,
you know,

1063
01:03:51,721 --> 01:03:55,160
80 90 feet up and hits you in
the head, you fucking gone, dude.

1064
01:03:56,900 --> 01:03:59,280
That's a rat. It's a lot of
weight coming down real fast.

1065
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:02,640
I had a buddy used to live in Hawaii
and they used to pick fresh mangoes.

1066
01:04:03,030 --> 01:04:04,530
They'd go pick wild mangoes,

1067
01:04:04,650 --> 01:04:07,980
just walked down this road and they
would find with mangoes and grab him and

1068
01:04:07,981 --> 01:04:12,630
take like a basket full of mangoes home.
So like, wow. Like if you live in Hawaii,

1069
01:04:13,230 --> 01:04:17,880
you kind of can forage for
fresh fruit for to live.

1070
01:04:18,420 --> 01:04:23,340
Yeah. I recently found,
I recently heard this,

1071
01:04:23,370 --> 01:04:24,780
and maybe it's incorrect,

1072
01:04:24,781 --> 01:04:29,781
but I'm pretty sure it's true that main
NGOs are somewhat related to poison ivy.

1073
01:04:30,331 --> 01:04:33,990
So if you're highly allergic to
poison ivy or poison oak or Sumac,

1074
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:38,760
then mangoes you would probably be
allergic to as well. Really? Yeah.

1075
01:04:38,820 --> 01:04:42,240
Wow. Find that out Jamie. I that that
should be, yeah, that should be looked at.

1076
01:04:42,241 --> 01:04:43,030
I should be,

1077
01:04:43,030 --> 01:04:48,030
but I do because I recently got poison
oak or poison ivy and so I was just

1078
01:04:51,241 --> 01:04:54,550
looking it up. Is that the only time
you've ever had it? Yeah. Really? Yeah.

1079
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:58,860
That's crazy. And it wasn't, it wasn't
that bad, but it was days later,

1080
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:02,050
so it must have uh huh on your toes.

1081
01:05:02,370 --> 01:05:04,220
Maybe when I washed everything together,

1082
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:06,720
like through the rain
gear and when we were, um,

1083
01:05:06,810 --> 01:05:11,810
we were hunting turkeys in Napa for
a mediator and there was poison oak

1084
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:16,290
everywhere and everyone was terrified
of it. All. A bunch of guys on the crew.

1085
01:05:16,291 --> 01:05:18,490
Got It. Yeah. But I fucking

1086
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:23,380
went way out of the way to not get an
it took my clothes off outside the car,

1087
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:27,800
put them. I was like in my
underwear outside. I don't
give a fuck. Come look. Yeah.

1088
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:32,950
I'm throwing my shit in a bag in the back,
not touching it with my hands,

1089
01:05:33,190 --> 01:05:34,990
taking it out from there.
When I got home,

1090
01:05:35,290 --> 01:05:38,710
I made sure that anything that might
have come in contact with that stuff

1091
01:05:38,711 --> 01:05:42,070
because Rinella was saying he got
it on his dick. That's a bad day.

1092
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:47,180
A lot of bad days. Shit
cooking. It's fun on your head.

1093
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:51,550
No worst place, I would think.
Yeah, that's the worst place.

1094
01:05:51,551 --> 01:05:52,390
But you think about it,

1095
01:05:52,391 --> 01:05:55,150
if you're touching the trees and then
you have to go to take a leak and you get

1096
01:05:55,151 --> 01:06:00,110
it on your deck. Is it true?
Oh, it's true. It's true.

1097
01:06:00,970 --> 01:06:05,040
Dodged the bullet on that one. You're
like, wow, this is what a weird word.

1098
01:06:05,050 --> 01:06:08,800
U. R. U. S. H. I. O.
L. How do you say that?

1099
01:06:09,850 --> 01:06:12,450
Ooh,
she all Rochelle.

1100
01:06:12,970 --> 01:06:16,300
Is it chemical found in the oil
of the mango, SAP or Schwab?

1101
01:06:16,301 --> 01:06:18,760
It was also found a poison
ivy and poison oak. Therefore,

1102
01:06:18,761 --> 01:06:22,450
people who have a history or reactions
to poison ivy and poison oak should be

1103
01:06:22,451 --> 01:06:26,260
cautious when handling mangoes.
Wow, that's interesting.

1104
01:06:26,890 --> 01:06:29,650
Very interesting. Uh,
when I did fear factor,

1105
01:06:29,651 --> 01:06:33,730
we found out that if you are allergic to
shellfish are also allergic to roaches,

1106
01:06:33,970 --> 01:06:38,110
same,
same exact enzyme and a roaches.

1107
01:06:38,380 --> 01:06:43,030
And so people that we had on the show,
well I should say person, one dude,

1108
01:06:43,390 --> 01:06:46,450
he ate a bunch of roaches and he
had shellfish allergy and it just,

1109
01:06:47,590 --> 01:06:51,590
his throat closed up to the side of like
a, like a soda pop Straw. And they look,

1110
01:06:52,750 --> 01:06:55,720
they probably didn't test for
that, you know, will they panicked?

1111
01:06:56,150 --> 01:06:58,150
They had to take this guy to the hospital,
they'd give him a shot.

1112
01:06:58,150 --> 01:07:01,330
I think we had an EMT standing by always.
Um,

1113
01:07:01,390 --> 01:07:04,060
so I think gave him a shot of adrenaline,
adrenaline or something like that.

1114
01:07:04,061 --> 01:07:05,710
Epinephrine, you think? What do
you, is that what they give him?

1115
01:07:06,220 --> 01:07:09,850
And then they send him to the hospital
and they kicked him off the show.

1116
01:07:09,851 --> 01:07:14,050
Get out of here, kid. You loose, keep
your mouth shut. It's never happened.

1117
01:07:14,350 --> 01:07:17,650
And we dodged so many
bullets on that show.

1118
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:22,660
There's that show man. I mean, they did
a great job with, don't get me wrong,

1119
01:07:22,780 --> 01:07:24,130
did a great job with stunts.

1120
01:07:24,410 --> 01:07:28,780
They plan things out well in advance and
they got approval from the network for

1121
01:07:28,781 --> 01:07:31,600
every step of the way,
but they dodged a lot of bullets.

1122
01:07:31,660 --> 01:07:33,940
Was there anything on there
that you thought to yourself?

1123
01:07:34,030 --> 01:07:36,580
I kind of want to try that. Oh
yeah, yeah. A bunch of them.

1124
01:07:36,940 --> 01:07:38,130
Like especially the car stunts,

1125
01:07:38,140 --> 01:07:41,110
like flipping cars off the
top of a building because uh,

1126
01:07:41,170 --> 01:07:45,880
they would flip them into these
gigantic stacks of cardboard boxes.

1127
01:07:46,150 --> 01:07:48,910
That's how they would,
um, do the Karstens.

1128
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:52,870
So they would have these folded up
cardboard boxes and they would stack them

1129
01:07:52,871 --> 01:07:56,050
like the size of a building,
like w two stories up.

1130
01:07:56,530 --> 01:08:01,340
And they had a crew of guys that would
go in there and stack these boxes so that

1131
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:04,720
they had boxes like that have a cardboard
box. It was like in the inside of,

1132
01:08:04,721 --> 01:08:07,900
it was like an ex and they would close
the box and then put another one on top

1133
01:08:07,901 --> 01:08:09,070
of it.
And close that backs up,

1134
01:08:09,071 --> 01:08:14,050
put another one on top of it and they
would have like stacked up 50 boxes high

1135
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:16,490
and then they would flip these cars

1136
01:08:16,490 --> 01:08:19,850
through the air off the top of
like a 10 story building and boom,

1137
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:24,680
we just landed on this giant building of
boxes of cardboard boxes and then sink

1138
01:08:24,980 --> 01:08:29,750
to the bottom. But it was totally safe
that way and it was so cool. Huh? That's,

1139
01:08:29,751 --> 01:08:31,040
that's what I wanted to try.

1140
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:34,340
What I've always wondered this because
I remember watching an episode of fear

1141
01:08:34,341 --> 01:08:36,870
factor. What? What's the deal with those
hundred year old eggs? It wasn't that,

1142
01:08:36,871 --> 01:08:40,670
it's not really a hundred
year old. What's, yeah, what's
the, it's an expression.

1143
01:08:41,090 --> 01:08:43,640
It's the Chinese call it
a hundred year old eggs.

1144
01:08:43,940 --> 01:08:48,940
And what it means is it's
a style of fermenting where
they would take an egg and

1145
01:08:50,151 --> 01:08:54,020
they would bury it in the ground.
And I don't remember the whole process,

1146
01:08:54,021 --> 01:08:58,100
but it's only really like a few months
old. Okay. But they become black.

1147
01:08:58,910 --> 01:09:02,420
Yeah.
The white becomes but nasty to us.

1148
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:05,520
But to Chinese people it's a
delicacy. Oh, okay. So it's,

1149
01:09:05,530 --> 01:09:06,700
it is something that people,

1150
01:09:07,790 --> 01:09:10,250
well that was one of the things
that we had to do early on.

1151
01:09:10,490 --> 01:09:15,490
We could only serve people something that
someone somewhere eight in the world.

1152
01:09:15,650 --> 01:09:19,280
Gotcha. So like if we, we serve
people eyeballs like sheeps, eyeballs.

1153
01:09:19,281 --> 01:09:21,260
That's a pretty common
thing that people eat.

1154
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:23,810
Especially in places where they
don't have much money. It's,

1155
01:09:23,811 --> 01:09:26,330
there's protein in that.
Don't throw it away, eat it.

1156
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:28,730
So there's a history of
people eat cheap side balls.

1157
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:33,440
We could serve cheap side
eyeballs, bugs, placenta,
placenta, the, believe it or not.

1158
01:09:33,441 --> 01:09:38,070
Right. That's a weird one. People Cook
it. That's disgusting. That's in Christ.

1159
01:09:38,180 --> 01:09:42,300
I've eaten a lot of strange things,
but the most recently string,

1160
01:09:42,540 --> 01:09:46,860
I tried to eat a live slug that,
oh, don't do that. No. Why did you,

1161
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:49,430
my fucking chickens don't
even like those things.

1162
01:09:49,470 --> 01:09:54,470
It immediately builds up this amazing
amount of like film in your mouth makes

1163
01:09:55,860 --> 01:09:59,660
everything. It was the, you almost have,

1164
01:09:59,690 --> 01:10:03,800
I guess you can get some kind of
brain worm from it as well. The,

1165
01:10:06,020 --> 01:10:10,750
at first I kind of bit it in half
to kind of get it and I was like,

1166
01:10:12,620 --> 01:10:17,300
and then immediately I regretted.
It was instantaneous,

1167
01:10:17,540 --> 01:10:20,120
but it took a few seconds. It was, it
was all the same. It was like one bite,

1168
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:22,160
two bites, and I was
like, what's happening?

1169
01:10:24,020 --> 01:10:27,250
This is not good. And at
that moment I realized, no,

1170
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:31,640
humans have no clue what you can eat and
go like, why did you have to eat it raw?

1171
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:36,140
I did well for the show, obviously
I didn't have to, I just found it.

1172
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:38,710
I was thinking, well, I've
never eaten a raw slug.

1173
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:43,340
And I was thinking about it and
I was in my mind, I was like,

1174
01:10:43,370 --> 01:10:47,690
I know there's something strange
about him. I know won't kill you.

1175
01:10:48,230 --> 01:10:50,030
And I was like, Yep, this
is why people don't do it.

1176
01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:54,770
Well you and Rinella eight a
coyote on that Mexico. So that was,

1177
01:10:54,830 --> 01:10:59,480
that was hard to watch. It wasn't that,
it wasn't that bad. It wasn't good.

1178
01:10:59,481 --> 01:11:02,900
It wasn't bad. But when you burn the
hair off of it, that's what I was like,

1179
01:11:02,930 --> 01:11:06,710
oh Jesus Christ to dipping,
dipping in that pond water.

1180
01:11:07,590 --> 01:11:11,570
Cause like it was a stagnant
pool in northern Mexico.

1181
01:11:13,110 --> 01:11:13,970
You just ask you

1182
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:17,760
how the new aids he just
asking to create it. Oh God.

1183
01:11:17,761 --> 01:11:22,761
So we got coyote aids
from singed coyote over.

1184
01:11:23,041 --> 01:11:27,840
Now let's got everything. He,
he's, I, he, he's got it all man.

1185
01:11:27,870 --> 01:11:28,710
He's had everything.

1186
01:11:29,490 --> 01:11:32,850
He had Giardia and Lyme
disease at the same time.

1187
01:11:34,010 --> 01:11:39,010
That's the worst combination of things
you can have because he got a trick.

1188
01:11:39,141 --> 01:11:43,490
GNOSIS too. He got trick analysis
as well. And so now when,

1189
01:11:43,550 --> 01:11:45,040
once I found out he got tricked nurses,

1190
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:49,040
I thought if Steve Rinella can get tricky
gnosis anybody can get your notices

1191
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:53,660
because he, him talking about bears
and trick gnosis goes hand in hand.

1192
01:11:54,620 --> 01:11:57,140
And when you're cooking
over a fire though,

1193
01:11:57,141 --> 01:11:59,840
a lot of this stuff you eat
is undercooked. Yeah. Um,

1194
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:05,080
so I recently went on a bear hunt and
brought a meat thermometer with me and

1195
01:12:06,381 --> 01:12:09,110
ate.
I eat some brown bear because I wasn't,

1196
01:12:09,250 --> 01:12:12,290
I always hear that Brown bear is inedible.

1197
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:16,030
And I, I'm just one of those people. I,

1198
01:12:16,190 --> 01:12:19,070
I'm not going to believe it until I've
tried it because I've heard a lot of

1199
01:12:19,071 --> 01:12:21,710
other things don't taste good.
And I have a really good,

1200
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:26,320
I'm defending myself in however, a really
good sense of taste. That's like what?

1201
01:12:26,330 --> 01:12:30,770
A slug and my mouth. But, uh, I thought
it was the best bear I've ever eaten.

1202
01:12:30,830 --> 01:12:32,140
Really? Yeah. And,

1203
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:36,050
and was it interior was through
coastal and it was eating a seal,

1204
01:12:36,140 --> 01:12:40,460
a dead seal carcass. And it was
good, but it was a younger bear.

1205
01:12:41,870 --> 01:12:45,380
It wasn't, I mean, for meat, I,

1206
01:12:46,420 --> 01:12:51,020
it was better than any black
bear I've ever had. Real.
Yeah. Was it the backstraps?

1207
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:55,580
Yeah, every, all of it. So you
ate everything and was this,

1208
01:12:55,640 --> 01:13:00,470
how did you cook it over? Well, we started
over the fire. I've done, it was good.

1209
01:13:00,980 --> 01:13:05,030
It was good. She could see, you could
visibly see like parasites, worms,

1210
01:13:05,031 --> 01:13:09,020
and some of the areas like around
stomach and eau Claire places.

1211
01:13:09,290 --> 01:13:11,870
But that's why I was
meat thermometer time.

1212
01:13:12,530 --> 01:13:16,850
But you could visibly see the
parasites. Wow. So I think that,

1213
01:13:16,910 --> 01:13:19,340
I think that immediately makes
people think it's going to be bad.

1214
01:13:20,060 --> 01:13:23,240
I don't know. I'm
bringing my a bear to, uh,

1215
01:13:23,590 --> 01:13:28,180
the bear that I have left to a
sausage guy. Uh, Bakersfield.
It makes good sausage.

1216
01:13:28,210 --> 01:13:31,660
Yeah, that's, that's probably the best
way to do it. We don't worry about it.

1217
01:13:31,900 --> 01:13:35,050
This guy makes a sausage and he
makes a really good summer sausage.

1218
01:13:35,051 --> 01:13:37,810
So if you get the summer sausage,
sorry, already cooked. You know,

1219
01:13:37,930 --> 01:13:41,170
just probably a good thing for
something like bare. But there's that,

1220
01:13:41,230 --> 01:13:43,420
that one element always
kind of bums me out,

1221
01:13:43,630 --> 01:13:46,180
but you always have to worry
about and having a parasite,

1222
01:13:46,181 --> 01:13:49,810
that's what I really like about deer or
elk or something like that is that you

1223
01:13:49,811 --> 01:13:52,120
don't have to think about
that. You eat it. Pretty rare.

1224
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:54,370
Yeah, it's really good. Yeah. You got,

1225
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:57,350
you almost have to under cook it
because once it, there's no fat in it,

1226
01:13:57,370 --> 01:14:00,850
so if you cook it too
much, it's just dry. Not,

1227
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:05,110
I think a lot of people almost don't
like wild meat because they don't prepare

1228
01:14:05,111 --> 01:14:09,940
it. Right? Yeah. It gets chewy. It's
real chewy and like, but if done right,

1229
01:14:10,300 --> 01:14:11,800
nothing better. Yeah. I was

1230
01:14:12,460 --> 01:14:16,720
at, uh, elk camp. These guys are putting
a one steak sauce on elk. I was like,

1231
01:14:17,180 --> 01:14:20,740
you guys should all go to jail,
shall be in jail for this. This is,

1232
01:14:20,741 --> 01:14:21,640
this should be illegal.

1233
01:14:22,810 --> 01:14:25,780
This one guy took all of
his elk and grounded up,

1234
01:14:25,781 --> 01:14:29,890
made hamburger out of everything. The
whole elk. All of it. Yeah. I was like,

1235
01:14:29,891 --> 01:14:34,810
that seems, I mean, look sick. Yeah. Elk
Burger tastes great. Don't get me wrong,

1236
01:14:34,870 --> 01:14:38,620
but why are you doing that?
Like when do you not know how to cook it?

1237
01:14:38,621 --> 01:14:40,420
Like that seems crazy.

1238
01:14:40,660 --> 01:14:44,520
Yeah. I like, I like cooking it in
large pieces. Almost like a roast. Yeah.

1239
01:14:44,530 --> 01:14:48,510
The back strap, big pieces, and then
slicing it after it's cooked that way.

1240
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:53,270
It's always, it's cooked. Right. It's
such a distinct flavor that you were,

1241
01:14:53,350 --> 01:14:53,640
you know,

1242
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:56,770
the only way you get it from a store
or is it they get it from New Zealand,

1243
01:14:56,771 --> 01:14:59,200
which is really weird. Yeah. And those,

1244
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:04,780
if you get deer like venison,
it doesn't distinguish what it is.

1245
01:15:04,781 --> 01:15:07,570
Most of the time it's a red
deer or fallow deer. Oh really?

1246
01:15:07,571 --> 01:15:12,030
So if you get venison from the New
Zealand red deer valley and there,

1247
01:15:12,260 --> 01:15:13,011
there I,

1248
01:15:13,011 --> 01:15:18,011
I call him like a lot raised but grass
fed because the grass grows so easy and

1249
01:15:18,221 --> 01:15:21,100
well over there. They know
green. Yeah, there's no,

1250
01:15:21,700 --> 01:15:25,690
there's not a lot of supplemental we
winter feeding or anything like that.

1251
01:15:25,691 --> 01:15:26,920
So it's grass fed.

1252
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:31,810
Most of the time no pesticides or any
of that kind of stuff would be added.

1253
01:15:31,850 --> 01:15:34,180
Just not necessary because the,

1254
01:15:34,250 --> 01:15:37,300
the animals there don't have
a lot of the things that we,

1255
01:15:37,301 --> 01:15:39,250
I mean they have
tuberculosis but that's a,

1256
01:15:39,730 --> 01:15:41,920
they don't have like mad cow
over there or anything like that.

1257
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:43,000
So they don't have to,

1258
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:47,000
they don't have a lot of the bugs that
we have in some places they have ticks

1259
01:15:47,001 --> 01:15:50,380
but not everywhere.
So they don't have to do a lot of things.

1260
01:15:50,381 --> 01:15:53,600
So it is fairly clean meat or consider it.

1261
01:15:53,710 --> 01:15:56,890
Which is weird that we have so
many deer and elk over here.

1262
01:15:56,891 --> 01:16:01,510
But yet when you buy meat,
a good percentage of it is
coming from New Zealand.

1263
01:16:01,870 --> 01:16:05,920
Yeah. Because it's, well, you
can't sell wild gave me in America.

1264
01:16:06,010 --> 01:16:07,390
That's wild because,

1265
01:16:07,470 --> 01:16:11,660
and I see the reason for it because
once you put a value on something up,

1266
01:16:11,670 --> 01:16:15,130
monetary value, then people
opt to break the law even more.

1267
01:16:15,160 --> 01:16:17,610
It's like rhinos and elephants and all.

1268
01:16:17,620 --> 01:16:21,790
If there was no value of the horns or the
tusks, no one would care. They wouldn't.

1269
01:16:22,450 --> 01:16:25,630
No one would shoot him. Yeah.
Illegally. Yeah. I mean,

1270
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:31,000
rhino tastes good. Corey Knowlton said
that it was one of the best meats.

1271
01:16:31,001 --> 01:16:34,910
He's every, when he shot that ball,
expensive steak. I would say that too.

1272
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:38,820
Like when I spend $30
on a steak that's gone.

1273
01:16:38,930 --> 01:16:41,200
That was the best steak I ever had.

1274
01:16:41,201 --> 01:16:46,201
When you spend $350,000 to shoot it and
endangered rhino and then eat it and

1275
01:16:46,501 --> 01:16:49,630
then get death threats for the
next six months. Yeah, pretty much.

1276
01:16:49,631 --> 01:16:52,280
Every day you're like, that's,
you're eating a steak on the house.

1277
01:16:52,281 --> 01:16:56,260
It's so worth it. Or He's
too, it was really good. He
said, be gentlemanly. Good.

1278
01:16:56,440 --> 01:17:00,340
I've heard hippos really good as well.
It's a big, it's a cousin of a pig, right,

1279
01:17:00,370 --> 01:17:04,000
isn't it? I'm not sure about that.
I think hippos related to a pig.

1280
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:08,290
I think it's like the cousin of a pig.
Something along those lines.

1281
01:17:08,291 --> 01:17:13,070
Just a giant nasty pig. You said you've
seen that video where the pig is a,

1282
01:17:13,071 --> 01:17:16,520
or the hippo rather is chasing
the people on a speedboat. Nope.

1283
01:17:17,210 --> 01:17:20,240
That's such a crazy video. See if
you can find that video, Jamie,

1284
01:17:20,420 --> 01:17:23,270
because these guys are in a boat and
they're trying to get away in this hippo

1285
01:17:23,271 --> 01:17:24,380
swimming after him,

1286
01:17:24,410 --> 01:17:29,410
like just charging in the water after
him and like his right on their ass and

1287
01:17:29,691 --> 01:17:33,830
it's as big as the boat. It's
fucking enormous. They move fast.

1288
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:35,420
Got Fast.

1289
01:17:35,420 --> 01:17:38,900
I was in Africa and a friend of mine,
um,

1290
01:17:39,030 --> 01:17:42,040
there's a Ph there and I was helping out.
He h means

1291
01:17:42,090 --> 01:17:45,600
professional hunter. Yeah.
That's like a guide in America.

1292
01:17:45,660 --> 01:17:48,960
They call them professional hunters
and Africa for folks listening.

1293
01:17:49,140 --> 01:17:51,690
And so there was a problem.
Hippo is

1294
01:17:51,970 --> 01:17:56,890
one that was a danger and could kill
people. So we went in there to go find it.

1295
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:58,233
Um,

1296
01:17:58,360 --> 01:18:02,920
and the speed that they move was insane.

1297
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:05,950
I've never seen anything
Matt size move that fast.

1298
01:18:05,951 --> 01:18:09,130
It kind of freaks you out because you're
in real tight quarters and it's in the

1299
01:18:09,131 --> 01:18:14,130
water and you see these bubbles just
coming. It's like guarantee towards you.

1300
01:18:14,131 --> 01:18:14,920
Yeah.
Yeah.

1301
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:19,180
To get you. Oh, here it is. Watch this.

1302
01:18:19,750 --> 01:18:20,583
Check this out.

1303
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:21,501
Hello.
He takes off.

1304
01:18:21,501 --> 01:18:25,820
But then he says the hippo just explode
or huge coming within just a few feet of

1305
01:18:25,821 --> 01:18:26,690
the back of the boat.

1306
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:31,580
The driver gunned the engine getting
away in just the nick of time,

1307
01:18:31,610 --> 01:18:33,710
I looked this up,
the size of that thing.

1308
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:37,340
You know that hippos are highly
aggressive and unpredictable and the most

1309
01:18:37,370 --> 01:18:41,220
dangerous mammal in Africa.
I would never have known that.

1310
01:18:41,740 --> 01:18:43,070
Thank goodness he gunned it.

1311
01:18:43,510 --> 01:18:47,410
Well, the size of that fucking thing.
Yeah. People don't know because a hungry,

1312
01:18:47,411 --> 01:18:50,170
hungry hippo. Yeah, I have. I play that
with my five year old the other day.

1313
01:18:50,710 --> 01:18:53,990
See it's cause Disneyland stop that
ride where they shoot at the hip us.

1314
01:18:54,850 --> 01:18:57,130
They had a ride where you shooting?
It wasn't the,

1315
01:18:57,220 --> 01:18:59,650
I think it was some kind
of jungle boat thing.

1316
01:18:59,651 --> 01:19:02,590
I remember that as a kid in the guide
would like pretend like you're shooting at

1317
01:19:02,591 --> 01:19:06,520
the hippos. Oh really? They stopped it.
I think we'll call you a monster now.

1318
01:19:06,580 --> 01:19:11,410
You Monster Hippos shot the whole movie.
They probably stopped that 20 years ago.

1319
01:19:11,550 --> 01:19:12,221
I do.
Well,

1320
01:19:12,221 --> 01:19:16,630
there's so many weird things that
we've turned cute like polar bears,

1321
01:19:16,631 --> 01:19:20,210
polar bears.
You saw Klondike bars and Coca Cola,

1322
01:19:20,650 --> 01:19:22,570
you know hippos.
They're like,

1323
01:19:22,571 --> 01:19:27,220
they're sweet and they dance around their
bows in their hair to tears. I mean,

1324
01:19:27,490 --> 01:19:30,820
we've done some weird things
to animals. I mean, Yogi Bear,

1325
01:19:31,030 --> 01:19:35,140
Yogi bears a fucking grizzly man.
You'll get bear lives in Yellowstone park,

1326
01:19:35,230 --> 01:19:39,010
right? Yeah. That's where he's supposed to
live. Or He's supposed to live in jelly,

1327
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:42,250
jelly stone. But it's basically
the same thing. Yeah, he's big.

1328
01:19:42,251 --> 01:19:45,280
He's way too big to be a black
bear. Right? He's fucking giant.

1329
01:19:45,310 --> 01:19:48,700
Joe Yogi shoot wears a hat. You
know, it was Harry boom, boom.

1330
01:19:48,701 --> 01:19:52,540
Just trying to get a little picnic basket.
You know what I mean? What did we do?

1331
01:19:52,541 --> 01:19:56,710
We, we confuse the shit out a
little kids. And then Bambi, Bambi.

1332
01:19:56,830 --> 01:19:59,400
Bambi was the one that
ruined hunting for everybody.

1333
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:04,390
And it also, Bambi is uh,
a buck. It's man's name.

1334
01:20:04,450 --> 01:20:07,850
Apparently. Bam. He's a
man's. Think about it.

1335
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:09,030
Bambi was a buck.

1336
01:20:10,410 --> 01:20:15,300
So we associate Bambi with female
Bambi was a female. No, it's a,

1337
01:20:16,350 --> 01:20:19,290
well the bucks were never
taken care of the offspring.

1338
01:20:19,380 --> 01:20:22,980
That's why that movie stupid
bammies a boy named sue really?

1339
01:20:26,470 --> 01:20:30,630
Cause like his dad knew he wouldn't be
around. So I'm going to name you Bambi.

1340
01:20:30,631 --> 01:20:34,710
You're going to grow up to be tough. So
everybody missed the point of that movie.

1341
01:20:34,711 --> 01:20:37,290
That's really what it was about.
A lot of hunters,

1342
01:20:37,530 --> 01:20:40,500
we'll talk about that
movie like it's like,

1343
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:42,960
like it was the end of good days.

1344
01:20:43,220 --> 01:20:47,370
I feel like it changed the way America
received hunting because all of a sudden

1345
01:20:47,371 --> 01:20:50,310
you get this adorable Bambi is adorable,

1346
01:20:50,311 --> 01:20:54,240
sweet deer and it was right around
the same time or Rudolph the red nose

1347
01:20:54,241 --> 01:20:58,450
reindeer came out. But there's,
there's no cows. No across that way.

1348
01:20:58,710 --> 01:21:01,610
Cows are fucked
dumping.

1349
01:21:01,810 --> 01:21:05,710
There's no happy cows in California.
There's happy cows. But are there,

1350
01:21:05,730 --> 01:21:08,810
I was driving to La today
and saw so many happy cows.

1351
01:21:10,990 --> 01:21:13,690
I think you're talking about people.
It's Deborah.

1352
01:21:14,010 --> 01:21:18,560
I passed no less than 12
McDonald's on the way. So gross.

1353
01:21:18,610 --> 01:21:23,100
Such a culture shock for me because I
literally spend most of my life around

1354
01:21:23,101 --> 01:21:24,120
very few people.

1355
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:28,200
And even yesterday I was just out in
the mountains of Montana guiding hunters

1356
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:32,640
and then I come here and look around
and you just feel like, holy smokes,

1357
01:21:32,641 --> 01:21:36,960
this is reality here. Whole well this
is this reality, this reality. Yeah.

1358
01:21:36,961 --> 01:21:38,550
It's completely different
than what I'm used to.

1359
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:42,000
And I think a lot of people don't realize
that there are people live completely

1360
01:21:42,001 --> 01:21:45,790
different than them. People in Montana.
I have no clue what this world isn't.

1361
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:50,760
The people here have no clue what that
world is. I Love Montana, I love it.

1362
01:21:50,790 --> 01:21:52,920
I was just in Bozeman last week.
Yeah,

1363
01:21:53,070 --> 01:21:57,450
we're pheasant hunting for a board
Danes TV show and we're wandering around

1364
01:21:57,451 --> 01:22:01,920
Bozeman. It's like, what a great place.
Isn't Bozeman? Awesome. So amazing. Yeah.

1365
01:22:01,950 --> 01:22:06,930
So Zpz you know the Steve
Show and they do 0.0 0.0 they,

1366
01:22:07,260 --> 01:22:09,900
they've just opened like an office
in Bozeman, so I get to go there

1367
01:22:11,430 --> 01:22:15,810
and loved that dude. Man. Bozeman
is a cool town. Fast is Scott.

1368
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:17,850
It's just got a cool
vibe and even like that,

1369
01:22:18,660 --> 01:22:23,660
well I guess the town is essentially 47
bars down main street interspersed with

1370
01:22:25,861 --> 01:22:30,140
sandwich and steak shops.
So I guess really there's
nothing not to like about it.

1371
01:22:30,210 --> 01:22:32,300
Yeah, it's pretty much perfect. Yeah.

1372
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:36,840
Not that many people city over the whole
state has like a million people, right?

1373
01:22:36,870 --> 01:22:38,970
Yeah, I think the whole state. Yeah. Yeah.

1374
01:22:38,971 --> 01:22:43,530
And there's the largest state
or it's, yeah, it's by volume.

1375
01:22:43,531 --> 01:22:48,030
It's the third largest state
and it has like what you said,

1376
01:22:48,031 --> 01:22:51,390
like less than a million people and
no traffic, just that doesn't exist.

1377
01:22:51,420 --> 01:22:55,710
There's no traffic jams. Five o'clock.
What happens? Nothing. He'd just drive.

1378
01:22:55,980 --> 01:22:58,890
It's like normal and I mean all around it.
There's just,

1379
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:01,530
you can be in the mountains,
you can get away from toddlers,

1380
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:06,040
big wilderness and Oh, it's beautiful. We
saw a lot of antelope, lot of pronghorn.

1381
01:23:06,580 --> 01:23:11,180
We saw, um, lot. We saw quite
a bit. Pheasants. I didn't
get one, but uh, wow. Shit.

1382
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:13,630
I'm supposed to probably not supposed
to say what happened on the show.

1383
01:23:14,010 --> 01:23:18,180
It's a mystery, but somebody did. He's
taller than me. He's got great hair. Uh,

1384
01:23:19,480 --> 01:23:23,590
we saw mule deer were out
there. It's just, it's
beautiful. It's fucking amazing.

1385
01:23:23,591 --> 01:23:27,610
Such a great state.
It's, it's wild. I mean,

1386
01:23:27,611 --> 01:23:31,510
it is as close to wild and real
wilderness as you can get in America.

1387
01:23:32,050 --> 01:23:36,880
And Alaska is another notch above that.
I go the Alaska, Alaska is like, oh yeah,

1388
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:41,020
check this out, bitch. Yeah,
we got, we got even bigger.

1389
01:23:41,170 --> 01:23:44,630
That's probably the biggest state.
Alaska, yeah. Yeah. The biggest date.

1390
01:23:44,740 --> 01:23:48,580
At least amount of people. It's probably
got the least amount of people. Right,

1391
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:52,780
and that makes sense. Yes. It technically
Montana's not the third largest state.

1392
01:23:52,781 --> 01:23:56,650
I guess it'd be, I think it's the
third California, right? I don't know.

1393
01:23:56,651 --> 01:23:59,610
I'd heard it was the third. They kept
saying it was the third. Maybe it is.

1394
01:23:59,850 --> 01:24:02,680
Whatever it is. It's
giant. I forgot where Miss,

1395
01:24:02,740 --> 01:24:06,520
I'm not smarter than a fifth
grader. Well, it's not smart.

1396
01:24:06,550 --> 01:24:10,330
It's information that's absorbed.
If you're really smart,

1397
01:24:10,331 --> 01:24:14,980
you would have actually gone out there
and measured it, right? But the, uh,

1398
01:24:14,981 --> 01:24:17,590
the mountains out there,
there's something amazing about them.

1399
01:24:17,830 --> 01:24:21,400
There's something amazing about like that
kind of solitude when you're in those

1400
01:24:21,401 --> 01:24:24,460
areas where you, you sit down,
you could sit down on the ridge,

1401
01:24:24,461 --> 01:24:27,370
like if you're glassing or stuff
like that and you just hear nothing.

1402
01:24:27,371 --> 01:24:28,210
You see your when

1403
01:24:30,230 --> 01:24:34,320
and you look out and you realize this
mountain doesn't give a fuck if you exist.

1404
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:37,320
It doesn't, it doesn't care if
you're here. If you're gone,

1405
01:24:37,530 --> 01:24:42,530
if you fall off this cliff and smash
your head on the rocks still there.

1406
01:24:44,070 --> 01:24:44,300
Okay.

1407
01:24:44,300 --> 01:24:48,140
Same. Exactly the same. You know, some
animals will find you, they'll eat you.

1408
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:51,770
And that's a wrap, you know? And
then everything keeps moving,

1409
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:55,160
keeps moving the same direction. It always
has thousands and thousands of years.

1410
01:24:55,460 --> 01:25:00,460
And then we think that the mountains
themselves came about through seismic

1411
01:25:01,071 --> 01:25:06,071
activity that forced the crust of the
earth to shift and move upwards and to

1412
01:25:06,651 --> 01:25:09,560
thousands and thousands
of feet above sea level,

1413
01:25:09,561 --> 01:25:14,240
like fucking crazy place. It
is me. While you were in la,

1414
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:19,250
chicken out McDonald's, we're happy
camps when you're doing this show.

1415
01:25:19,251 --> 01:25:20,720
And we briefly touched on it before.

1416
01:25:20,721 --> 01:25:24,950
It's called Apex Predator and it's on
the uh, outdoors network outdoorsman,

1417
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:27,920
outdoor channel, outdoor
channel, sportsmen's network,

1418
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:32,690
sportsmans channel and the outdoor
channel. And the outdoor channel, um, has,

1419
01:25:32,691 --> 01:25:35,410
uh, your show, you're,

1420
01:25:35,411 --> 01:25:40,411
you're trying to imitate the
methods that various animals use in,

1421
01:25:40,751 --> 01:25:43,800
in trying to survive and
in hunt prey. And, uh,

1422
01:25:44,090 --> 01:25:47,150
I got curious about a couple of these
that I haven't seen yet. First of all,

1423
01:25:47,151 --> 01:25:50,600
the mountain line one, what did you do
for the mountain? Mine warm. So yeah,

1424
01:25:50,601 --> 01:25:53,090
so the show is kind of a,

1425
01:25:53,300 --> 01:25:58,300
I see it as almost a natural history
lesson where we're looking at humans are,

1426
01:25:59,330 --> 01:26:04,250
in my opinion,
undoubtably the species on the planet

1427
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:08,570
because we can adapt so many things
that other animals do so well.

1428
01:26:09,110 --> 01:26:14,110
But the other thing that we're looking
at is how did humans become these top

1429
01:26:14,541 --> 01:26:17,630
hunters? It's called Apex Predator.
Not that I'm the Apex Predator,

1430
01:26:17,631 --> 01:26:18,950
they were studying apex predators,

1431
01:26:18,951 --> 01:26:23,000
but humans as a whole are pretty
much at the top of the food chain.

1432
01:26:23,300 --> 01:26:27,680
And we can look at everything a certain
animal does or something in nature

1433
01:26:27,681 --> 01:26:31,370
that's specialized and possibly
try to mimic it in a way.

1434
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:34,040
And so with the mountain lion episode,

1435
01:26:34,370 --> 01:26:39,080
what we did is the mountain
lion is a very silent predator.

1436
01:26:39,110 --> 01:26:42,710
They're quiet. And that's one of
the reasons they're so effective.

1437
01:26:43,310 --> 01:26:44,840
And so my thought was,
well,

1438
01:26:45,290 --> 01:26:49,790
can humans be as quiet as a mountain lion?
How do we do this?

1439
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:53,720
So I looked at a mountain lion and met
with the mountain line expert and then we

1440
01:26:53,721 --> 01:26:58,640
actually did some experiments
on the mountain lion as
far as measuring its force.

1441
01:26:58,640 --> 01:27:03,410
It exerts on the ground and
how essentially how loud
it isn't when it walks in

1442
01:27:03,411 --> 01:27:06,200
the way it walks and s with slow
motion cameras and everything.

1443
01:27:06,740 --> 01:27:11,740
And then I tried to mimic that in a
certain way by using moccasins or,

1444
01:27:11,990 --> 01:27:13,160
or even bare feet.

1445
01:27:13,670 --> 01:27:17,780
And w what would I found out
while doing this is pretty cool.

1446
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:21,590
I don't want to give it all away, but
humans really like the way we walk now.

1447
01:27:21,591 --> 01:27:25,490
We heel strike and it's a forceful impact
and without forceful impact does is it

1448
01:27:25,491 --> 01:27:28,070
puts, because we're by
Peter, we put, you know,

1449
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:33,160
all of our weight on one foot at a time
pretty much as we're moving our feet and

1450
01:27:33,501 --> 01:27:38,450
that's allowed and especially
the way we do it. But as humans,

1451
01:27:38,660 --> 01:27:42,680
modern footwear has dictated the way
we now walk with our heel strike.

1452
01:27:42,980 --> 01:27:46,400
We used to walk almost identical
to the mountain line with our,

1453
01:27:46,910 --> 01:27:51,200
with our PTOs first slowly rolling
our planet and being quiet.

1454
01:27:51,590 --> 01:27:56,590
So we've kind of evolved into this allowed
bumbling animal when originally we,

1455
01:27:56,990 --> 01:28:00,560
we naturally are quiet
like the mountain lion.

1456
01:28:00,950 --> 01:28:03,530
I've tried to run that way on your,

1457
01:28:03,650 --> 01:28:06,950
on your daughter's hose and
it feels so odd. It does.

1458
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:11,960
It feels like I'm doing it wrong, you
know, cause and uh, the, the, the design,

1459
01:28:11,961 --> 01:28:15,770
like what you're saying of footwear
is what is making people run.

1460
01:28:15,771 --> 01:28:17,560
He'll first its running shoes,
you know,

1461
01:28:17,570 --> 01:28:20,120
I mean obviously we found
out and makes you faster,

1462
01:28:20,121 --> 01:28:24,020
but then you have all these injuries.
I think it has to,

1463
01:28:24,470 --> 01:28:28,910
I don't know because the way it was
explained to me is yeah, you're,

1464
01:28:28,911 --> 01:28:31,130
you're propelling forward off your toes.

1465
01:28:31,160 --> 01:28:36,160
So that's giving you more ground
force to push off at a running gait.

1466
01:28:36,690 --> 01:28:39,320
Um,
because if you land on your toe,

1467
01:28:39,321 --> 01:28:42,860
you have to lean forward more and you
don't have as much ground force exerted

1468
01:28:42,861 --> 01:28:46,130
because you're using the inertia of the
heel to roll forward and push forward.

1469
01:28:46,310 --> 01:28:49,730
That makes sense. Um,
but I mean it makes us,

1470
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:52,460
I think sort of,
yeah,

1471
01:28:52,580 --> 01:28:57,020
it's got to make us faster as is
what it was explained to me. But it,

1472
01:28:57,290 --> 01:29:00,350
whereas when you're on your toes,

1473
01:29:01,410 --> 01:29:04,320
you absorb more shock.
So I think you have,

1474
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:07,410
I would probably less injury,
well,

1475
01:29:07,411 --> 01:29:09,900
when I first started reading
about this and hearing this,

1476
01:29:09,901 --> 01:29:13,830
I watched my kids run around
and especially when they're
run around barefoot and

1477
01:29:13,831 --> 01:29:15,690
they run PTOs first test first,

1478
01:29:15,990 --> 01:29:20,180
it's just that's natural for that natural
way to walk different. Yeah. It's,

1479
01:29:20,200 --> 01:29:21,150
and it's hard to,

1480
01:29:21,450 --> 01:29:25,080
it's hard to reverse because you're
trained so much to walk like that,

1481
01:29:25,081 --> 01:29:28,110
but they're only real way
to do it is just go without,

1482
01:29:28,590 --> 01:29:33,510
I used moccasins because there's a lot
of it was you can actually still feel the

1483
01:29:33,511 --> 01:29:33,841
ground,

1484
01:29:33,841 --> 01:29:36,640
the same as just a piece of leather to
keep the thorns and everything else.

1485
01:29:36,730 --> 01:29:41,730
Cause I was going miles a day and your
feet would get tired and sore and you had

1486
01:29:42,751 --> 01:29:47,751
to walk on your toes because
otherwise your knees hurt your,

1487
01:29:48,030 --> 01:29:51,420
your whole body or you'd have to,
there's no way to do it otherwise.

1488
01:29:51,421 --> 01:29:55,470
When you're barefoot, when is that going
to change the way you wear footwear?

1489
01:29:55,471 --> 01:30:00,090
When you go hunting? Do you, do you wear
like a thick, heavy mountain boot? Um,

1490
01:30:01,960 --> 01:30:04,830
what boot I wear depends on
the terrain and what I'm doing,

1491
01:30:05,250 --> 01:30:06,780
but generally if I'm stocking,
you know,

1492
01:30:06,790 --> 01:30:11,120
it's something I generally just take
my shoes off. I always have, um,

1493
01:30:11,130 --> 01:30:15,860
go in my socks or barefoot or it's
just to be quiet. Yeah. Because that,

1494
01:30:15,870 --> 01:30:19,770
uh, you know, the stiff sole of a boot,

1495
01:30:20,340 --> 01:30:23,310
you can't feel the ground as a hunter.

1496
01:30:23,311 --> 01:30:27,120
You really need to be able to feel the
ground snapping twigs and things along

1497
01:30:27,121 --> 01:30:28,980
those lines. Yeah. I think there's,

1498
01:30:29,130 --> 01:30:34,130
there's a lot of things that hunters do
that I think a lot of people may not do.

1499
01:30:35,191 --> 01:30:39,180
And I notice it when I guide people or
whatever. Even guys that hunt a lot,

1500
01:30:39,181 --> 01:30:42,150
but maybe not the type of hunting
that I do, even the way we walk,

1501
01:30:42,151 --> 01:30:46,620
a lot of people walk in, they look
down at the ground. I don't get that.

1502
01:30:46,890 --> 01:30:51,330
They don't want to step on anything.
Yeah. But yet it's because we don't,

1503
01:30:51,420 --> 01:30:54,660
we've, same thing, we've, we no
longer need to feel the ground,

1504
01:30:54,661 --> 01:30:56,970
but it should be walking with
our heads up, looking around.

1505
01:30:56,971 --> 01:30:58,740
We know how to walk and
know what's in front of us.

1506
01:30:58,770 --> 01:31:03,640
That's when the poisonous seed, right. I
think that's what people worry about. No,

1507
01:31:03,750 --> 01:31:06,330
that's the bear that gets you while
you're sleeping so you shouldn't sleep.

1508
01:31:06,331 --> 01:31:09,360
That's right. You should look around
and walk. She asleep during the day,

1509
01:31:09,410 --> 01:31:10,260
clean bear's asleep.

1510
01:31:10,270 --> 01:31:14,700
And that's the move that is
the move or sleeping I no Trey,

1511
01:31:15,180 --> 01:31:18,450
but if you fall, uh, yeah, the move is a,

1512
01:31:18,490 --> 01:31:22,780
there is no move like you have to the
movies your truck. That's right. Yeah.

1513
01:31:22,790 --> 01:31:26,460
I sleep in the fucking truck. I've always
thought that that's gotta be the mood.

1514
01:31:26,461 --> 01:31:29,400
Like sleep, sleep in some sort
of a camper type situation.

1515
01:31:29,610 --> 01:31:32,160
Those ones that I saw
that have, uh, it was, uh,

1516
01:31:32,340 --> 01:31:34,810
they had it on a Land Cruiser where the,
uh,

1517
01:31:34,840 --> 01:31:38,710
it was like a shelf that folds over and
then a ladder comes down the ladder acts

1518
01:31:38,711 --> 01:31:41,880
as sort of a prop.
And then from there they,

1519
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:45,240
they pop this tent up and
then just sleeping on the
roof of the truck. I'm like,

1520
01:31:45,241 --> 01:31:48,600
that's perfect. Yes. I saw him
once at a trail head and thought,

1521
01:31:48,630 --> 01:31:52,200
well that's pretty neat. Also kind of
looked like a pain in the ass there too,

1522
01:31:52,860 --> 01:31:55,720
a little bit. It's a little
high, you know. Well,

1523
01:31:55,750 --> 01:31:58,890
it's only about six inches
above the truck. Not too bad.

1524
01:31:58,891 --> 01:32:01,090
When you think about hole,
you get a whole tent in there.

1525
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:04,150
But if someone's going to climb up
that ladder, at least you can hear it.

1526
01:32:04,420 --> 01:32:05,253
You know,

1527
01:32:05,560 --> 01:32:10,300
I think if you've got a tent out and a
bear comes and gets you and your tent,

1528
01:32:11,180 --> 01:32:16,090
the statistical probability of that,
it's so small that it was just bad timing.

1529
01:32:16,150 --> 01:32:21,040
It's my peer time. Why wonder if they
had, I wonder if they had a, an open tent.

1530
01:32:21,290 --> 01:32:24,520
I have to ask where know how old
that kid got bit in the head.

1531
01:32:25,030 --> 01:32:26,740
I mean especially in Alaska,

1532
01:32:26,741 --> 01:32:30,010
I spent a lot of time up there
this year and it's so wet.

1533
01:32:30,670 --> 01:32:35,670
You have that 10 open most of the time
just to kind of keep air flowing and keep

1534
01:32:36,011 --> 01:32:40,890
everything more dry. It seems like I
do. At least you leave it open. I leave,

1535
01:32:41,080 --> 01:32:44,750
I close the vest. You Boo. But I leave
a lot of the tent. Yeah. Open, you know,

1536
01:32:44,950 --> 01:32:45,520
vent it.

1537
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:49,720
Cause I think a lot of people just close
themselves in there and then your body

1538
01:32:49,721 --> 01:32:54,640
creates sweat and steam and then nothing
ever dries out when you, uh, there's,

1539
01:32:54,641 --> 01:32:57,730
there's all these different
moves now to try to, or uh,

1540
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:03,000
movements now to try to hike and
camp out as lightly as possible,

1541
01:33:03,310 --> 01:33:06,760
like super light packs. Some guys
don't even bring their own water,

1542
01:33:06,761 --> 01:33:10,990
they just bring filters so they can felt
fine water and filtered along the way.

1543
01:33:10,991 --> 01:33:12,880
And then it sort of adds to the element,

1544
01:33:12,881 --> 01:33:17,710
like you're living almost off the land,
like really close to off the land.

1545
01:33:17,890 --> 01:33:22,150
And I know you've done hunts where you
literally did, you didn't bring any food.

1546
01:33:22,150 --> 01:33:26,440
Like there was some of your episodes
where you were starving to death on TV.

1547
01:33:26,770 --> 01:33:31,330
Yeah. Um, yeah I, I like to go
light sometimes at my own detriment.

1548
01:33:31,650 --> 01:33:36,340
Um, I think you know, there, there's
times where, you know, I think,

1549
01:33:37,020 --> 01:33:41,030
well there, there's uh, they always
say like Hump, like you're hungry. Mm.

1550
01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:46,060
And I've, I've done, I've done some
research on things and your, your physio,

1551
01:33:46,210 --> 01:33:47,980
your physiology changes.

1552
01:33:48,550 --> 01:33:51,560
There's a lot of animals that
only hunt when they're hungry. Um,

1553
01:33:51,700 --> 01:33:53,740
there's some that just always hunt.
Um,

1554
01:33:54,220 --> 01:33:58,030
but or like not hungry but literally
starving. But you sense more your,

1555
01:33:58,031 --> 01:33:59,440
your sense of smell is heightened.

1556
01:33:59,860 --> 01:34:02,620
I think you do like they call
it more exploratory sniffing,

1557
01:34:02,650 --> 01:34:06,580
but you're just taking in more senses
and dissecting everything a little bit

1558
01:34:06,581 --> 01:34:09,750
more. Cause everything's sort of
ramped up because you need the sources.

1559
01:34:09,790 --> 01:34:11,650
You're hungry.
So when you walk into a place,

1560
01:34:11,770 --> 01:34:14,890
if you walk into a grocery store or like
a restaurant or you're walking down the

1561
01:34:14,891 --> 01:34:16,300
street and you're really hungry,

1562
01:34:16,330 --> 01:34:21,010
you'll smell the Turkey roasting a lot
further away than you would if you are on

1563
01:34:21,011 --> 01:34:22,860
a completely full
stomach because it's not,

1564
01:34:22,870 --> 01:34:26,350
your brain is not searching for food at
that point. Yeah. My wife always says,

1565
01:34:26,351 --> 01:34:30,050
don't go grocery shopping. Hungry,
hungry. You want to Frickin,

1566
01:34:31,420 --> 01:34:34,660
when you walk through the bread aisle,
when you're hungry, you smell the bread.

1567
01:34:35,050 --> 01:34:39,310
You don't at any other thing.
You're like, I need bread. So true.

1568
01:34:39,910 --> 01:34:43,180
You never smell it when you're
full. That's so true. I wonder,

1569
01:34:43,290 --> 01:34:45,730
so it physiologically, are there
changes that are going on? Yeah.

1570
01:34:45,731 --> 01:34:50,290
You're doing more exploratory. Well
you're, you're smelling more times,

1571
01:34:50,470 --> 01:34:53,920
your brain's processing what's coming
in because it's looking for food.

1572
01:34:53,950 --> 01:34:56,920
So this is actually a measurable
fact. Wow. That makes,

1573
01:34:57,680 --> 01:34:59,630
it makes sense that
it's designed like that.

1574
01:34:59,631 --> 01:35:01,850
And it also makes sense that maybe your,
your,

1575
01:35:02,090 --> 01:35:06,830
your senses would be heightened and you'd
be like less prone to fuck around and

1576
01:35:06,831 --> 01:35:10,850
really get down to business. Yeah.
But I mean a lot of times yeah,

1577
01:35:10,851 --> 01:35:13,750
as far as going back country type,

1578
01:35:13,790 --> 01:35:17,360
you can't carry everything you
need most times seen. Yeah.

1579
01:35:17,361 --> 01:35:19,520
You need to drink water is there,
you need to,

1580
01:35:19,940 --> 01:35:23,600
I mean I'll bring as much food
as I can on a normal trip,

1581
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:25,970
but a lot of times I made,
you know,

1582
01:35:26,100 --> 01:35:30,530
if you can find something also to eat
or bring them catch fish or whatever,

1583
01:35:30,860 --> 01:35:33,130
it just aids and you being
able to stay out there longer.

1584
01:35:33,190 --> 01:35:36,590
You just have to rely on the ability
to do that. And when you don't,

1585
01:35:36,860 --> 01:35:39,950
like there was that one trip that
you did on solo hunter where you a,

1586
01:35:39,951 --> 01:35:42,770
I think it was a mule
deer hunt. Yup. In Nevada.

1587
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:46,380
And you basically were
starving to death on TV. Yeah.

1588
01:35:47,110 --> 01:35:49,790
And then part of that was I
had food with me on that one,

1589
01:35:50,150 --> 01:35:54,650
but I was burning way more calories than
I was taking in because you're hiking

1590
01:35:54,651 --> 01:35:57,980
in the high country and just going in,
it was rough,

1591
01:35:57,981 --> 01:36:00,740
steep stuff and I didn't
bring enough food,

1592
01:36:00,741 --> 01:36:05,300
but I also wasn't finding any deer so
I just kept staying on and didn't have

1593
01:36:05,301 --> 01:36:08,840
enough food. And then eventually
I found a deer. I was like, fine.

1594
01:36:09,290 --> 01:36:11,560
When you ate that day or was that the
best tasting thing you've ever eaten in

1595
01:36:11,561 --> 01:36:14,990
your life? That was good. I think ate
the heart. Raw it you're like, yeah.

1596
01:36:15,260 --> 01:36:18,400
All you bit into it on
this show. Yeah. Um,

1597
01:36:18,440 --> 01:36:22,100
like when you did the black bear
episode, what did you do for that? Uh,

1598
01:36:22,101 --> 01:36:26,010
that was forging, so, oh, so he did it
all. Foraging, foraging, just kind of,

1599
01:36:26,270 --> 01:36:29,750
I wouldn't call it a survival episode
cause I just think that's kind of,

1600
01:36:30,070 --> 01:36:31,730
it's hard to it.
I've,

1601
01:36:31,731 --> 01:36:36,110
I've decided the only real way to do
a survival type show would be to film

1602
01:36:36,111 --> 01:36:39,520
yourself. And that's the truth
because like Les Stroud does. Yeah.

1603
01:36:39,521 --> 01:36:42,590
And I think like maybe that, I don't know
if you've seen naked and afraid. Yes.

1604
01:36:42,620 --> 01:36:45,930
I think that ones like the way they
have it set up, it could be sued.

1605
01:36:46,010 --> 01:36:47,840
It's super legit in my opinion.

1606
01:36:48,380 --> 01:36:53,060
But I think also like when you're
trying to do is film a survival show.

1607
01:36:53,061 --> 01:36:54,410
You're also filming a TV show.

1608
01:36:54,411 --> 01:36:58,340
So you need to do certain
things for filming that are
detracting from surviving.

1609
01:36:58,590 --> 01:37:03,590
So you may not be dedicating
100% attention to finding
food and other things I

1610
01:37:04,431 --> 01:37:07,250
guess. But yeah, I didn't bring
any food or anything with me.

1611
01:37:07,490 --> 01:37:11,750
So for three days I foraged to like a
bare wood and I wasn't intending to hunt

1612
01:37:12,290 --> 01:37:16,510
anything. I was just foraging and can be
like, is this a hunting show? Is this a,

1613
01:37:16,550 --> 01:37:18,800
well it's not really a hunting shows,
but it's also,

1614
01:37:19,460 --> 01:37:24,200
I wanted to see what lesson I learned
from that and I learned a pretty sweet

1615
01:37:24,201 --> 01:37:26,600
lesson as far as why

1616
01:37:28,100 --> 01:37:32,240
humans possibly needed to hunt.
You know,

1617
01:37:32,300 --> 01:37:34,590
as far as the sucks. Yeah. Well it,

1618
01:37:34,640 --> 01:37:37,820
yeah it devotes so much
time and you're eating,

1619
01:37:38,210 --> 01:37:39,890
I call them the bitter leafy Greens,

1620
01:37:39,891 --> 01:37:44,870
just sticks and twigs and it tastes
like shit, you know, was much calories.

1621
01:37:44,871 --> 01:37:47,280
Can you get out of that
though? Not that much. I,

1622
01:37:48,260 --> 01:37:50,120
I mean you,

1623
01:37:51,020 --> 01:37:54,320
you can get enough enter what I call it
is like getting enough energy to go out

1624
01:37:54,321 --> 01:37:56,130
hunting cause you at some point

1625
01:37:56,130 --> 01:37:59,010
are going to want a
substantial meal and even just,

1626
01:37:59,490 --> 01:38:03,750
I mean obviously like three days
here and can you could even fast for,

1627
01:38:03,900 --> 01:38:06,570
you know, you don't need
that food. But when you're,

1628
01:38:06,571 --> 01:38:09,210
when you're working and doing things
like if you were going out hunting, yeah,

1629
01:38:09,211 --> 01:38:13,410
you're burning a lot of calories to try
to get a bigger score that you can have

1630
01:38:13,411 --> 01:38:16,400
for a longer period of time
where I wasn't working,

1631
01:38:16,490 --> 01:38:19,620
just kind of gathered constantly
gathering little salads,

1632
01:38:19,621 --> 01:38:24,300
like little salads with no dressing like
you would so monotonies through that so

1633
01:38:24,301 --> 01:38:27,990
quick to your body would just like light
that on fire at some point when you're

1634
01:38:27,991 --> 01:38:28,824
eating.

1635
01:38:28,830 --> 01:38:33,260
I mean like real bitter stuff like
Chicory and Daniel Lyons and crap and it's

1636
01:38:33,270 --> 01:38:36,690
just so bitter.
It's like I'll just go hungry.

1637
01:38:36,860 --> 01:38:41,520
Just longing for some Newman's own
salad dressing. It's something cook it.

1638
01:38:42,030 --> 01:38:42,391
I was like,

1639
01:38:42,391 --> 01:38:47,391
this slug would probably be better now
when you ate the slug and you said that

1640
01:38:47,851 --> 01:38:50,120
there was a worm that you could
possibly get the bleeding and warm.

1641
01:38:50,130 --> 01:38:51,780
I get know about that beforehand.
Yeah.

1642
01:38:53,630 --> 01:38:56,160
Apparently I've done a lot
of things that I find out.

1643
01:38:56,161 --> 01:38:58,350
I like to do things and
then research afterwards.

1644
01:38:58,770 --> 01:39:01,770
It's kind of like trial by fire.
I've done a lot of bullets,

1645
01:39:01,771 --> 01:39:06,180
but I guess I think they eat rat
shit that has something in it.

1646
01:39:06,930 --> 01:39:11,820
Who Does bears do? Slugs. Oh, slugs do.
Oh, SPEC slugs eat ratchet. And then that,

1647
01:39:11,880 --> 01:39:14,130
that's somehow or another region,
but it'd be in their intestines.

1648
01:39:14,131 --> 01:39:19,131
So I know that enough to not eat
intestines have a lot of things.

1649
01:39:20,190 --> 01:39:23,580
I didn't even know slugs hadn't test
since. I thought they were just a slug.

1650
01:39:23,581 --> 01:39:27,540
And I've got my whole little
soul tracks going on. Yeah.

1651
01:39:27,690 --> 01:39:31,080
Well I've Fed, uh, my,
my chickens love snails.

1652
01:39:31,680 --> 01:39:36,540
They'll fuck a snail up, man.
They find a snail. My chickens
are funny, man. They'll,

1653
01:39:36,541 --> 01:39:39,860
they'll stand by. Like if
I'll, I'll pick up a rock. No,

1654
01:39:39,890 --> 01:39:44,070
they'll wait around the rock and I'll
lift up the rock and they fucking swarm

1655
01:39:44,071 --> 01:39:47,360
under the rock looking to
get at whatever's in there.
Like they know now they've,

1656
01:39:47,670 --> 01:39:49,740
their brains are so small,
they're so stupid.

1657
01:39:50,130 --> 01:39:54,030
But they know now that when I go near
a rock, I'm gonna pick it up for them.

1658
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:56,520
And they noticed some shit underneath
that rock that go after it.

1659
01:39:56,790 --> 01:39:59,510
But when they see a snail, they'll
fucking fight over it. They'll,

1660
01:39:59,550 --> 01:40:04,020
they'll check each other out of
the way. And Jack that snail. Yeah,

1661
01:40:04,080 --> 01:40:05,240
they're [inaudible] snails.

1662
01:40:05,730 --> 01:40:10,230
Snails are a lot better than
slugs and worn seal of approval.

1663
01:40:10,980 --> 01:40:14,520
But you ate everything raw. You
didn't try to cook anything, did you?

1664
01:40:15,190 --> 01:40:16,110
You'll have to watch the episode.

1665
01:40:16,111 --> 01:40:21,111
I eat something that might
even make fear factor really.

1666
01:40:21,480 --> 01:40:25,750
But it was good. I was like, whoa. Hey,
this is delicious. Now what about, um,

1667
01:40:25,830 --> 01:40:29,470
I saw the otter episode and you held
your breath for like four minutes, right?

1668
01:40:29,720 --> 01:40:34,080
A little over four minutes. That's crazy.
I did it in this studio. I had that guy,

1669
01:40:34,081 --> 01:40:36,270
the iceman, Wim Hoff.
We've heard of that guy.

1670
01:40:37,050 --> 01:40:41,610
He's the guy that summited Everest
in his shorts with no shirt on.

1671
01:40:42,060 --> 01:40:43,680
Yeah.
Well the ice shoes on.

1672
01:40:43,800 --> 01:40:48,570
He ran a half marathon in Finland at
30 below zero weather with no shoes and

1673
01:40:48,571 --> 01:40:52,410
shorts with no shirt on. Yeah. He's
got this crazy breathing method.

1674
01:40:52,770 --> 01:40:54,040
It's wild breathing

1675
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:58,030
method and he's just,
he's got 26 I believe,

1676
01:40:58,031 --> 01:41:03,031
world records for in endurance and cold
and the ability to withstand cold swam,

1677
01:41:03,940 --> 01:41:08,800
supposed to swim 50 yards under
the ice to this hole in Antarctica.

1678
01:41:09,070 --> 01:41:13,390
And uh, when was it Antarctica,
wherever it was somewhere cold as fuck.

1679
01:41:13,391 --> 01:41:16,330
We swam under ice anyway.
It was so cold.

1680
01:41:16,331 --> 01:41:20,320
The water was so cold that his eyeballs
froze and he couldn't see so he couldn't

1681
01:41:20,321 --> 01:41:23,470
find where the whole is
to pop up at 50 yards in.

1682
01:41:23,650 --> 01:41:27,820
So he swam back and forth, say wound
up swimming. The actual distance,

1683
01:41:27,821 --> 01:41:32,170
there's over a hundred yards underwater.
It's crazy with one breath. Yeah.

1684
01:41:32,460 --> 01:41:34,450
It was the same cause holding,

1685
01:41:34,600 --> 01:41:38,440
holding your breath and cold water's
super hard. It's really hard.

1686
01:41:38,710 --> 01:41:40,690
That's one of the things
we found on a fear factor.

1687
01:41:41,140 --> 01:41:44,080
He would put these people in cold
water and make them do these stunts.

1688
01:41:44,480 --> 01:41:45,610
As soon as you get in there,

1689
01:41:45,830 --> 01:41:50,340
your start shivering. Yeah.
Using up your oxygen. Have
you, have you, you should try.

1690
01:41:50,360 --> 01:41:52,430
Have you ever tried the
long breath hold thing?

1691
01:41:52,820 --> 01:41:55,010
The longest I've ever held.
It was on the show.

1692
01:41:55,070 --> 01:41:57,620
Two minutes and 30 seconds
or something like that.

1693
01:41:57,920 --> 01:42:02,140
That's like that. That's not you and a
half minute threshold. Once you, it's,

1694
01:42:02,180 --> 01:42:06,340
it's a crazy experience because everybody
can hold their breath for that for

1695
01:42:06,350 --> 01:42:09,800
five minutes I think. Yeah.
Well you did it the first time.

1696
01:42:09,801 --> 01:42:11,410
You only did it for a couple of minutes.
Right?

1697
01:42:11,550 --> 01:42:15,020
We'll just like straight out of the gate.
No practice. Just a minute and a half.

1698
01:42:15,620 --> 01:42:16,610
And then,
yeah,

1699
01:42:16,611 --> 01:42:20,690
and by the end of the few hours I was
holding my breath for over four minutes

1700
01:42:20,990 --> 01:42:25,640
and this was just someone teaching
you a method. We'll really,

1701
01:42:25,641 --> 01:42:27,330
it's just a mental thing.
Get over.

1702
01:42:27,680 --> 01:42:31,610
It was just knowing that you aren't
going to die when your body is screaming

1703
01:42:31,611 --> 01:42:35,480
that you are, uh, it's a
weird, but once you break the,

1704
01:42:36,530 --> 01:42:40,400
once you break through that
threshold, you're like, ah.

1705
01:42:40,790 --> 01:42:45,110
And even when I got up, I was thinking to
myself, I could have gone longer. Really?

1706
01:42:45,290 --> 01:42:47,440
Yeah.
Because he was there in,

1707
01:42:47,450 --> 01:42:51,200
the first thing they teach you is like
when you're with a a dive buddy or

1708
01:42:51,201 --> 01:42:53,240
whatever these things, he's like, breathe.

1709
01:42:53,270 --> 01:42:56,510
The first thing he tells you his breathe
because you get up and you forget to

1710
01:42:56,511 --> 01:43:00,740
breathe like everybody blacks out at
the surface because it's almost like you

1711
01:43:00,741 --> 01:43:02,180
figure it out.
You really don't need air.

1712
01:43:02,181 --> 01:43:06,370
It's just the mental aspect of thinking
that you do. It's really weird. And,

1713
01:43:06,390 --> 01:43:09,710
and they kind of explained
the whole stages of your,

1714
01:43:09,860 --> 01:43:13,790
your body that you'll go through and
they know when you actually do need to

1715
01:43:13,791 --> 01:43:18,740
breathe. And so we, it's a, it's
like the coolest feeling though.

1716
01:43:18,741 --> 01:43:20,540
When you get up, you're like, wow,

1717
01:43:20,780 --> 01:43:24,530
it's a mental thing and a physical
thing and it's a cool feeling. Well,

1718
01:43:24,531 --> 01:43:26,180
it's a primal terror.
Yeah.

1719
01:43:26,590 --> 01:43:31,180
Not having any air as a primal
terrorist. Yeah. It's makes people panic,

1720
01:43:31,680 --> 01:43:34,000
you know? And when you're
a, when you're exhausted,

1721
01:43:34,210 --> 01:43:36,670
that's one of the things that
MMA fighters do to each other.

1722
01:43:36,820 --> 01:43:38,350
When they're exhausted though,

1723
01:43:38,410 --> 01:43:41,130
they'll cover the other guy's
mouth and nose and it's,

1724
01:43:41,250 --> 01:43:46,250
it's a legal tactic and you'll see it
like in grappling matches where guys will

1725
01:43:46,331 --> 01:43:46,931
have a guy,

1726
01:43:46,931 --> 01:43:50,140
I'll have a guys back in and tried to
choke him and he'll cover his whole cover,

1727
01:43:50,141 --> 01:43:52,020
his mouth and his and his nose.
She's a

1728
01:43:52,030 --> 01:43:54,860
garlic.
And when you try to move that guy's hand,

1729
01:43:54,890 --> 01:43:57,680
that's when will choke you
because you're exposing your neck.

1730
01:43:57,681 --> 01:44:00,920
Like you might be defending your neck
and then they just cover your mouth hall

1731
01:44:00,921 --> 01:44:01,640
and then you have to,

1732
01:44:01,640 --> 01:44:05,510
you have to open up a little to try
to stop the covering your mouth.

1733
01:44:05,511 --> 01:44:08,870
And that's when they get an arm on
doing neck. Once you start to panic,

1734
01:44:08,871 --> 01:44:12,500
you use up all that had essential oxygen.
Well,

1735
01:44:12,501 --> 01:44:15,860
Wim Hof has held his breath for
seven minutes and I was like,

1736
01:44:15,861 --> 01:44:19,960
Jesus Christ just sitting here. He would
just hold it for seven minutes. Yeah,

1737
01:44:20,440 --> 01:44:22,970
I'd say hold it for seven minutes
underwater. I think too. Yeah.

1738
01:44:22,971 --> 01:44:25,760
There's people that can go 12 plus.

1739
01:44:25,880 --> 01:44:30,200
Well didn't David Blaine wins did make
some world record? I think so. Yeah.

1740
01:44:30,201 --> 01:44:33,770
And what he did. He pack he lung
packed with pure oxygen. Yeah,

1741
01:44:33,830 --> 01:44:35,600
that's what I heard. Yeah. Yeah.

1742
01:44:35,601 --> 01:44:38,240
He like breathe in from a tank
or something like that. Right.

1743
01:44:38,510 --> 01:44:43,100
And then it allows you to hold
it much longer, I guess. Yeah,

1744
01:44:43,160 --> 01:44:46,190
but still that first like,
well if you did two and a half minutes,

1745
01:44:46,191 --> 01:44:49,500
that first tooth first minute
feels like forever. Yeah.

1746
01:44:49,501 --> 01:44:53,090
I probably a Deb going a little longer,
but I was starting to panic. Yeah,

1747
01:44:53,091 --> 01:44:54,510
you just get,
I would,

1748
01:44:54,620 --> 01:44:57,860
the other thing though is to
initiate the Mammalian dive reflex.

1749
01:44:57,861 --> 01:44:59,870
You need to like splash
your face with water.

1750
01:44:59,871 --> 01:45:04,010
You need to kind of like lower your heart
rate, kind of almost meditation style,

1751
01:45:04,011 --> 01:45:08,120
lower your heart rate, get into a
place where your body's ready for it.

1752
01:45:08,360 --> 01:45:10,700
That's what they call it. 1
million dive reflex. The same.

1753
01:45:10,701 --> 01:45:15,701
It's the same reflex that whales and
all aquatic mammals use to hold their

1754
01:45:16,671 --> 01:45:19,520
breath and humans have the exact
same dive reflex that whales.

1755
01:45:19,520 --> 01:45:24,200
Have you ever heard the
theory of the aquatic ape? Mm,

1756
01:45:24,500 --> 01:45:25,040
no.

1757
01:45:25,040 --> 01:45:29,000
It's a really fascinating theory about
human beings that they believe that human

1758
01:45:29,001 --> 01:45:31,100
beings evolved around water.

1759
01:45:31,370 --> 01:45:35,270
And that's why our babies are so
fat because, uh, like a champ,

1760
01:45:35,271 --> 01:45:37,280
baby chimp babies or sinewy,

1761
01:45:37,460 --> 01:45:42,080
they come out of the gate like yoked
chimp babies already fucking shredded,

1762
01:45:42,430 --> 01:45:46,880
you know, and our babies are so fat.
And the idea is that, uh, our babies,

1763
01:45:46,910 --> 01:45:49,380
like if you take a chimp baby
and you throw it in the water,

1764
01:45:49,381 --> 01:45:50,810
apparently the little fucker will drown.

1765
01:45:51,230 --> 01:45:53,480
But if you take a human baby
and he throw it in the water,

1766
01:45:53,481 --> 01:45:57,740
the baby will hold its breath, right?
Yeah. That's that Mammalian dive reflex.

1767
01:45:57,741 --> 01:46:02,080
We automatically know how to hold their
breath. So there's that general swim.

1768
01:46:02,081 --> 01:46:07,081
Now that's where it came from that we
like literally evolved to be around water

1769
01:46:08,331 --> 01:46:09,350
and we're around water,

1770
01:46:09,620 --> 01:46:12,470
which kind of almost makes sense when
you think about the fact that the high

1771
01:46:12,471 --> 01:46:14,590
population centers are
always around ports.

1772
01:46:15,360 --> 01:46:18,740
We're all always around water and that's
how we've been traveling back and forth

1773
01:46:18,741 --> 01:46:23,680
for eons. Well, there's a lot of food
underwater as well. Now, what do you,

1774
01:46:23,690 --> 01:46:26,090
when you, uh, did the otter
episode, what did you try,

1775
01:46:26,120 --> 01:46:30,050
did you try to eat shit that
you found or did, did uh,

1776
01:46:30,140 --> 01:46:33,650
open water spear phishing thing.
Oh, that's right. Yeah. Yeah.

1777
01:46:33,660 --> 01:46:37,190
Spear phishing is like not fishing.
It's like underwater hunting. Yeah.

1778
01:46:37,191 --> 01:46:41,930
That's cool. It's fun. I've, I've
done it before and once I did this,

1779
01:46:42,140 --> 01:46:44,540
like learning from a guy who
really knows what he's doing,

1780
01:46:44,630 --> 01:46:48,470
I realized that everything I had done in
the past probably should have killed me.

1781
01:46:50,610 --> 01:46:54,270
The top 10 things not to do. I did. I
was like, what? What are those things?

1782
01:46:54,330 --> 01:46:58,650
Let your air out. I would like as I
would swim up and I would, I would go,

1783
01:46:58,770 --> 01:47:03,770
I would dive pretty deep without anybody
without a buddy and just all kinds of

1784
01:47:04,771 --> 01:47:08,070
stupid stuff.
So did you do the proper calculations?

1785
01:47:08,071 --> 01:47:11,190
Like Bordain was telling
me he loves a scuba diving,

1786
01:47:11,430 --> 01:47:15,000
but he said one of the hardest
things was learning the calculations.

1787
01:47:15,001 --> 01:47:17,400
Like you've been this deep for this long,

1788
01:47:17,401 --> 01:47:21,780
so you have to go to this area and
wait and then go to that area and wait.

1789
01:47:21,781 --> 01:47:24,390
Like there's like calculations that you
have to do to make sure you don't get

1790
01:47:24,391 --> 01:47:27,900
the bends. You don't do that. Um, when
you take a breath from the surface,

1791
01:47:28,170 --> 01:47:31,720
because when you're scuba diving,
you're breathing compressed air, right?

1792
01:47:31,850 --> 01:47:36,210
So as you go different depths in the
water, the pressure changes on your body.

1793
01:47:36,210 --> 01:47:40,320
So the amount of oxygen in that space
changes. So if you take a breath,

1794
01:47:40,710 --> 01:47:44,220
like if you dove down, took a breath
from compressed air and wind up,

1795
01:47:44,221 --> 01:47:48,150
your lungs would explode, you'd be dead.
Whoa. That's why when you free dive,

1796
01:47:48,210 --> 01:47:49,620
it's one breath.
You can't,

1797
01:47:49,950 --> 01:47:54,240
you can't be down there and go emergency
sipping on oxygen and then shoot up to

1798
01:47:54,241 --> 01:47:58,320
the surface cause you'll float right
up to the top and explode. Oh Wow.

1799
01:47:58,470 --> 01:48:00,540
So you got to,
if you take it from the surface,

1800
01:48:00,750 --> 01:48:05,400
your lungs change with the space of air,
if that makes sense.

1801
01:48:05,460 --> 01:48:10,380
That does make sense. So as you
dive deeper, your lungs compact,

1802
01:48:10,890 --> 01:48:13,460
but what that does is it puts
the same amount of oxygen,

1803
01:48:13,480 --> 01:48:14,430
a smaller amount of space.

1804
01:48:14,640 --> 01:48:19,410
So it's almost like you feel
you have more breath I guess,

1805
01:48:19,950 --> 01:48:22,800
but you feel the pressure and then
as you go up, your lungs expand.

1806
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:23,790
So it kind of feels,

1807
01:48:24,030 --> 01:48:28,230
so you can kind of play with your breath
hold based on the depths that you're at.

1808
01:48:28,590 --> 01:48:30,840
I've never been in deep water before,

1809
01:48:31,020 --> 01:48:33,870
but I would imagine like the
pressure must feel really freaky.

1810
01:48:34,310 --> 01:48:37,350
Like if you're like, what does it,
what does it feel like on your body?

1811
01:48:37,410 --> 01:48:41,970
It just feels like, yeah, it
feels heavy. Heavy pressure. Yeah.

1812
01:48:42,270 --> 01:48:46,860
Wow. And, and the weight of your,
so your buoyancy changes as well.

1813
01:48:46,861 --> 01:48:48,990
So it depends how deep your diving.

1814
01:48:48,991 --> 01:48:52,500
But like I was waited for 33 feet,

1815
01:48:52,501 --> 01:48:57,501
so at 33 feet I would float
to the top below 33 feet sink.

1816
01:48:58,110 --> 01:49:01,440
Oh, so, so, so the first
33 feet you kick down,

1817
01:49:01,470 --> 01:49:04,470
you're kicking harder because you're
floating, right. Once you get past that,

1818
01:49:04,471 --> 01:49:07,350
you can slowly kick because you know,

1819
01:49:07,351 --> 01:49:10,980
to change the amount of energy you're
doing and you can keep going down, down,

1820
01:49:10,981 --> 01:49:11,370
down.

1821
01:49:11,370 --> 01:49:14,430
But because as you're sinking and then
when you come back up you need to kick

1822
01:49:14,431 --> 01:49:17,580
hard and then once you hit 33 feet,
you pretty much just float to the surface.

1823
01:49:17,581 --> 01:49:22,230
So if you blacked out, as long as you're
above 33 feet, you'll pop back up. Wow.

1824
01:49:22,231 --> 01:49:24,660
So on your way up, because most of
the blackouts happen at the top,

1825
01:49:24,720 --> 01:49:29,700
what kind of crazy assholes figured out
how town they're sticking to the tank

1826
01:49:29,940 --> 01:49:32,760
connected to. I mean when did
they first start doing that?

1827
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:35,400
When did scuba dive in first
start getting, not sure.

1828
01:49:36,090 --> 01:49:40,020
I know they used to pump it from the
surface and the big helmets, you know?

1829
01:49:40,170 --> 01:49:42,510
Oh that's right. Yeah. I
said it'd be on the top.

1830
01:49:42,630 --> 01:49:46,770
I remember watching videos about those
fucking things wants to leak like crazy

1831
01:49:46,771 --> 01:49:47,604
too.

1832
01:49:48,290 --> 01:49:52,240
They probably SAP use tree SAP and shit.
Just see love suit

1833
01:49:54,160 --> 01:49:55,930
take drop you in like a rock.

1834
01:49:55,960 --> 01:49:57,820
The first time somebody got
the Benz it probably like,

1835
01:49:57,821 --> 01:49:59,300
what's wrong with this pussy?
Oh yeah.

1836
01:50:01,870 --> 01:50:03,700
They were just making it
up as they went along,

1837
01:50:04,150 --> 01:50:06,790
but free diving is not the same issues.
Right.

1838
01:50:06,940 --> 01:50:10,000
You could take a deep breath and you can
go as deep as you want and come back up

1839
01:50:10,001 --> 01:50:13,920
as quick as you want. Right? Yup. No, no
speed. And that's how you did it. Yeah.

1840
01:50:14,710 --> 01:50:17,950
So that seems to me like
super risky though, right?

1841
01:50:17,980 --> 01:50:20,440
Like if you're down there and you're,
you're running out of air,

1842
01:50:20,850 --> 01:50:25,470
it's gotta be, um, no, I don't
know. I mean it could be,

1843
01:50:25,530 --> 01:50:29,790
I guess if it's, I think it's like
anything if you do it safely, right? Yeah.

1844
01:50:29,791 --> 01:50:31,940
It's kind of unnerving when you dive down.

1845
01:50:31,980 --> 01:50:35,910
You look up and just like you're really
deep and you're holding your breath,

1846
01:50:35,940 --> 01:50:38,280
holding your breath. But if you
start to panic, you're gonna,

1847
01:50:38,720 --> 01:50:41,580
it's counterproductive.
You're going to use up your,

1848
01:50:41,910 --> 01:50:46,170
so when you feel like you're out there
and you start panicking and then you're

1849
01:50:46,171 --> 01:50:51,120
out, you're going to be out
of here faster. Yeah. Now
when you, when you do it,

1850
01:50:52,170 --> 01:50:55,560
dive down and he goes deep as you
can and then your spear fishing.

1851
01:50:55,590 --> 01:50:58,800
Do you have like a watch on the
tells you like where you're at?

1852
01:50:59,300 --> 01:51:03,130
Are you just going based on I can hang
in here for like another 30 seconds and I

1853
01:51:03,131 --> 01:51:03,590
got it

1854
01:51:03,590 --> 01:51:05,490
ended up pretty much.
And you can like,

1855
01:51:05,491 --> 01:51:09,120
you could drop a line down that you
could almost see like dive by aline has

1856
01:51:09,121 --> 01:51:13,300
markings on it. Yes. I mean I'm
by no means a dive expert. Right.

1857
01:51:13,350 --> 01:51:17,520
But I mean it's one thing that I,
I do enjoy doing it.

1858
01:51:17,610 --> 01:51:21,630
It seems awesome. Yeah. Now,
um, when you do do it though,

1859
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:23,820
like what is the longest time you've ever,

1860
01:51:23,821 --> 01:51:25,860
I mean you held your breath for
four minutes was a long time.

1861
01:51:25,880 --> 01:51:28,050
You ever held your breath
while you were free diving and

1862
01:51:28,260 --> 01:51:30,760
spearfishing? Probably two
minutes. Two minutes. Yeah.

1863
01:51:30,920 --> 01:51:32,870
It's about half cause you can go,

1864
01:51:32,940 --> 01:51:37,850
well you would do is like go down say
40 feet and just hang for a minute and

1865
01:51:37,851 --> 01:51:40,430
then back up. You know,
it's like 30 seconds down,

1866
01:51:40,790 --> 01:51:45,530
minute back up to the surface. So you go
into like a riff or something like that?

1867
01:51:45,560 --> 01:51:48,860
Yeah. Or were you just like for that
episode we were in open ocean. Most.

1868
01:51:48,861 --> 01:51:52,520
Everything I've done before was fishing
around like spear fishing around reefs.

1869
01:51:53,060 --> 01:51:55,430
But this was open ocean.

1870
01:51:55,431 --> 01:51:58,880
Just like that's kind of weird cause
you're kicking down. There's no bottom,

1871
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:04,000
just blue water. You see a giant sharks
from black. He saw sharks. Yeah. Oh God.

1872
01:52:04,550 --> 01:52:05,900
And then, but then you, you get there,

1873
01:52:05,901 --> 01:52:10,130
you hang and you see this whole school
of fish and then they come up to you like

1874
01:52:10,131 --> 01:52:13,520
big school, big fish. I mean
these are 40 pound fish.

1875
01:52:13,950 --> 01:52:17,430
There's a video that somebody sent me from
South Africa. These guys, South Africa,

1876
01:52:17,431 --> 01:52:20,010
maybe Australia, I'm not sure.
I think it was Australia.

1877
01:52:20,011 --> 01:52:23,280
Now let me think about these guys caught
a Marlin and they're bringing in the

1878
01:52:23,281 --> 01:52:27,870
Marlin and a shark. Malls. It
like feet from the boat like six,

1879
01:52:27,871 --> 01:52:29,040
seven feet from the bulk,

1880
01:52:30,210 --> 01:52:35,200
cuts it in half and all they pull up
as the fin or the, uh, the nose. Those,

1881
01:52:35,340 --> 01:52:38,340
what they call it shark, what
did they call the, the sword,

1882
01:52:38,341 --> 01:52:42,570
the sword or whatever it is.
Everything from the Gills back has gone,

1883
01:52:42,740 --> 01:52:46,190
but it was a big shark. It was a
great white, just severed half smashed

1884
01:52:46,190 --> 01:52:50,000
it. It's like fuck that.
Fuck all that. Yeah.

1885
01:52:51,710 --> 01:52:54,810
They throw a propane tank in there
and try to shoot it with a 30 yes.

1886
01:52:57,470 --> 01:53:01,940
Great movie. Now when you saw the big
shark, did you freak out at all? No.

1887
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,640
And it was gone as quick as it appeared.
Oh it was,

1888
01:53:04,700 --> 01:53:06,870
it was pretty cool though because um,

1889
01:53:07,240 --> 01:53:10,310
it w I needed a break after a while
because it's just kind of starting to get

1890
01:53:10,330 --> 01:53:15,330
seasick and I got on the boat and we had
Dan Dodi through aligning and caught a

1891
01:53:16,520 --> 01:53:20,270
fish and he's fighting this fish is like
sweet and then all of a sudden his rod

1892
01:53:20,271 --> 01:53:24,760
just doubles over, fishes gone. That
shark just hammered it. Took it.

1893
01:53:24,950 --> 01:53:29,180
Oh my God. It's pretty cool. That is
cool. And then the shark was gone.

1894
01:53:29,450 --> 01:53:34,220
I mean we only saw it briefly. I don't
even remember what kind it was. Fuck.

1895
01:53:34,520 --> 01:53:36,290
But I mean it eight a 40 pound fish.

1896
01:53:36,310 --> 01:53:40,550
Where were you guys again
when you're efficient? Gulf
of Mexico. Off Florida. Yeah.

1897
01:53:40,551 --> 01:53:45,260
There's a lot of fish down
there in the law. Sharks. It
was cool. Uh, the whole, uh,

1898
01:53:45,261 --> 01:53:49,010
west coast to California, like down
through Mexico. A lot of sharks.

1899
01:53:49,310 --> 01:53:53,780
Apparently there's a breeding
area that's around San Francisco,

1900
01:53:54,110 --> 01:53:57,700
like San Francisco, the great
whites. They breed up there. Hmm.

1901
01:53:57,730 --> 01:54:01,550
Which is very unnerving.
Yeah. Right outside of a city,

1902
01:54:01,551 --> 01:54:06,140
the biggest monster Predator on the
planet between San Francisco and Alcatraz.

1903
01:54:06,170 --> 01:54:09,330
Yeah. Yeah. Right there. Yeah.
Where people are swimming. Yeah.

1904
01:54:09,410 --> 01:54:11,660
That's where they breed.
Fuck that.

1905
01:54:12,470 --> 01:54:17,240
Fuck all that you have you seen it? I'm
sure you've had to have seen that video.

1906
01:54:17,300 --> 01:54:20,630
I just recently saw it though.
I'm kind of outdated. But uh,

1907
01:54:20,990 --> 01:54:24,940
the surf competition where the dude, the
shirt grabs. That's pretty cool. Yeah.

1908
01:54:25,150 --> 01:54:28,100
Crazy. We'll explain it
and explain what happened.

1909
01:54:28,120 --> 01:54:30,770
[inaudible] he's paddling
in a surf competition.

1910
01:54:31,070 --> 01:54:34,850
Then all of a sudden the guy just,
he just went under, right. Sharp,

1911
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:39,880
grabbed somehow went for the board and
got his leash and it was funny cause the

1912
01:54:41,751 --> 01:54:45,260
announcers had no clue what was going on.
They were just kinda talking normal.

1913
01:54:45,830 --> 01:54:50,420
It'd be like you announcing UFC and a
bear coming in and eating the dude and

1914
01:54:50,421 --> 01:54:53,030
just continuing on like, oh,
something strange is going on.

1915
01:54:53,690 --> 01:54:58,490
And Nate Diaz has disappeared from
the octagon. Yeah. What about,

1916
01:54:58,491 --> 01:55:01,460
um, there was one that you did
that was a Golden Eagle one.

1917
01:55:01,461 --> 01:55:03,470
What did you do with that one? Uh, we,

1918
01:55:03,590 --> 01:55:08,590
we looked at the way that the eagle
uses vision and I mean they can see prey

1919
01:55:09,051 --> 01:55:12,020
animals from up to two miles away,
which is insane.

1920
01:55:12,470 --> 01:55:16,550
I've heard that about bald eagles in
Alaska that they can see fish on the water

1921
01:55:17,360 --> 01:55:20,260
fish that are coming up on the surface.
They could see for miles. Yeah.

1922
01:55:20,780 --> 01:55:24,200
They say that eagles have,
well, even as they're flying,

1923
01:55:24,210 --> 01:55:25,880
they can see things so much faster.

1924
01:55:26,150 --> 01:55:29,360
It's almost like if you explain a
camera the way it has frame rates,

1925
01:55:29,361 --> 01:55:32,330
you can change the frame rate. If a
camera's how many frames per second? Well,

1926
01:55:32,331 --> 01:55:35,690
we have essentially the same thing in
our brain of how many images we can see

1927
01:55:35,691 --> 01:55:38,270
per second. So something's moving
real fast. We can't see it.

1928
01:55:38,810 --> 01:55:42,830
Where's the Eagle as its flying,
it sees more images at,

1929
01:55:43,620 --> 01:55:47,070
plus they have two centers of focus in
their eyes so they can focus in near and

1930
01:55:47,071 --> 01:55:49,800
far simultaneously.
Whereas our eyes change,

1931
01:55:49,801 --> 01:55:52,500
we look at our hands and everything else
is blurry and we look at the wall and

1932
01:55:52,501 --> 01:55:56,460
our hands are blurry, but they can focus
on two things at the exact same time.

1933
01:55:56,490 --> 01:56:01,230
So they're looking at it like, um,
like, like a video camera. Yeah.

1934
01:56:01,470 --> 01:56:06,360
Instead of like a film camera or a video
camera. This might be too technical,

1935
01:56:06,361 --> 01:56:10,890
but a video camera with a high f stop.
That means that like it's,

1936
01:56:11,460 --> 01:56:15,720
but it's actually different. Like the
more light, less light you let in,

1937
01:56:15,870 --> 01:56:17,280
the more things are in focus.

1938
01:56:17,760 --> 01:56:22,710
But they have two centers of focus
where our eyes just have one. Huh.

1939
01:56:23,970 --> 01:56:25,050
Wow.
Yeah.

1940
01:56:25,350 --> 01:56:30,350
But then we related that to using optics
and being able to sit up on a mountain

1941
01:56:30,991 --> 01:56:35,040
top and spot animals from two
plus miles away consistently.

1942
01:56:36,120 --> 01:56:40,130
Yeah. That's the one thing that animals
haven't figured out yet. Optics. Yeah.

1943
01:56:40,190 --> 01:56:43,590
Well just if you could get
an eagle pair of binoculars.
Yeah. Well, the Eagle, yeah,

1944
01:56:43,591 --> 01:56:46,200
it's got the optics built into its head.

1945
01:56:46,350 --> 01:56:49,380
I wonder if they mean they can
spot things from miles away,

1946
01:56:49,381 --> 01:56:54,381
but I mean I wonder if they
have like a magnified vision.

1947
01:56:54,810 --> 01:56:58,140
Yeah, they do. They did. Yeah. It's
just like looking through optics.

1948
01:56:58,141 --> 01:57:03,120
I mean they can spot things. Their
visions, it's hard to quantify it as,

1949
01:57:03,300 --> 01:57:03,900
cause we,

1950
01:57:03,900 --> 01:57:08,900
we use numbers with our optics like eight
times or they say they say an antelope

1951
01:57:08,971 --> 01:57:12,410
has like eight power, binocular vision.
See, throw up your eight carbon oculars.

1952
01:57:12,411 --> 01:57:14,190
And it was like what an analyst.

1953
01:57:14,220 --> 01:57:17,100
But they also obviously can see right in
front of them when they're eating their

1954
01:57:17,101 --> 01:57:20,490
foods. So it's different. So
they can see as they're flying,

1955
01:57:20,491 --> 01:57:24,270
they can look like on the hill two miles
away and right below him it's such a

1956
01:57:24,271 --> 01:57:26,680
fast rate that they can spot things.
They,

1957
01:57:26,900 --> 01:57:30,210
they kind of have a search image in their
head of what an animal looks like and

1958
01:57:30,211 --> 01:57:33,570
then when they see it,
the key on it and fly that direction.

1959
01:57:33,660 --> 01:57:36,600
That's one of the more fascinating things
about vision is that so many different

1960
01:57:36,601 --> 01:57:40,740
animals have different kinds of vintage
vision that of simultaneously evolved.

1961
01:57:40,800 --> 01:57:45,720
Yeah. The octopus, which is another
animal that you study. Cat Hands Down,

1962
01:57:45,840 --> 01:57:47,300
coolest animal on the planet.
Really?

1963
01:57:47,460 --> 01:57:51,000
I don't even know if it's from this
planet now after release. So weird.

1964
01:57:52,230 --> 01:57:57,090
Okay. Their vision, they
don't see the octopus.

1965
01:57:57,120 --> 01:57:59,220
The one thing I was looking as
their ability to camouflage,

1966
01:57:59,520 --> 01:58:03,210
and I don't think a lot of people realize
that's probably the most amazing thing

1967
01:58:03,211 --> 01:58:08,130
about the octopus. If you can find
a video of octopus, they can shape,

1968
01:58:08,131 --> 01:58:11,700
shift and change their
color and shape instantly.

1969
01:58:12,510 --> 01:58:14,370
Have you ever seen that,
oh,

1970
01:58:14,490 --> 01:58:18,870
this is going to blow your mind yet we
don't know how with all of our technology,

1971
01:58:18,900 --> 01:58:20,880
we cannot replicate it and
we don't know how they do it,

1972
01:58:21,210 --> 01:58:22,740
but they have chromatophores
in their skin,

1973
01:58:22,741 --> 01:58:27,741
which is like pigment cells and they
can change the color of their skin,

1974
01:58:27,990 --> 01:58:29,610
but because they have no bones,

1975
01:58:29,820 --> 01:58:34,320
they can also adjust the
shape instantaneously to
match whatever's around them.

1976
01:58:34,350 --> 01:58:37,020
Like coral. Yeah. Well
they can, whatever it is,

1977
01:58:37,050 --> 01:58:40,800
like multiple colors and they
can match it identically.

1978
01:58:40,990 --> 01:58:44,290
Yet they don't see color,
but they can match the color identically.

1979
01:58:44,410 --> 01:58:48,400
So they almost feel like,
like we don't know how this works,

1980
01:58:48,700 --> 01:58:53,560
but there is a running theory that they
somehow see through their skin that we

1981
01:58:53,561 --> 01:58:57,730
don't understand. It's, you got
to see these videos. There's,

1982
01:58:57,760 --> 01:59:02,050
there's a bunch of videos of just
octopus camouflaging themselves. They'll,

1983
01:59:02,080 --> 01:59:05,850
there's one clip that we use in the show
where it like goes up to this rock in

1984
01:59:05,851 --> 01:59:10,210
instantly morphs itself.
It's, it's, it's a,

1985
01:59:10,240 --> 01:59:14,890
it's a live action cloaking
mechanism. Crazy. There's live,

1986
01:59:14,920 --> 01:59:18,490
that's a great way of
describing this is this one. Um,

1987
01:59:18,730 --> 01:59:20,790
I'll have a tough time showing it
to the audience because you took,

1988
01:59:20,870 --> 01:59:24,160
might take it down, but Gotcha.
Okay. Well let's just show it to us.

1989
01:59:24,430 --> 01:59:27,760
We'll show it so we won't put it on
the, well, what's the name of this?

1990
01:59:28,090 --> 01:59:32,800
So for people. Okay. Shape shifting
octopus. Okay. So we'll get, uh,

1991
01:59:32,830 --> 01:59:36,310
we'll, we'll look at it and people
and Youtube go fuck yourself.

1992
01:59:37,420 --> 01:59:41,710
Slow motion right now. So it was
a slow motion and it's, Oh my God,

1993
01:59:42,730 --> 01:59:45,970
whoa. Even see that octopus. Whoa.

1994
01:59:45,971 --> 01:59:49,930
What the fuck man?
And people don't really know that they do.

1995
01:59:49,931 --> 01:59:51,330
That well describes.
Amazing.

1996
01:59:51,350 --> 01:59:53,770
Describe what we're looking at
for people that can't see this.

1997
01:59:53,771 --> 01:59:58,000
The octopus goes to a rock that
has multiple textures on it.

1998
01:59:58,060 --> 02:00:02,200
I would say there's some kelp and some
or some, some kind of plant materials.

1999
02:00:02,630 --> 02:00:03,490
A Brown rock.

2000
02:00:03,970 --> 02:00:08,970
It changes its skin to match
probably three where you see three,

2001
02:00:09,581 --> 02:00:12,950
four colors in there. Well that's
not even in the texture that that,

2002
02:00:12,980 --> 02:00:17,350
that's a plant. It's a plant.
So it became that algae.

2003
02:00:17,560 --> 02:00:21,440
Exactly. That's fucking insane. I
need to see that again. That isn't,

2004
02:00:21,490 --> 02:00:26,050
I know I did. There's a, they do it
instantaneously to, if there's like a,

2005
02:00:26,320 --> 02:00:30,340
there's some videos of it where it does
it. So it's so fast. Within a second.

2006
02:00:30,430 --> 02:00:33,010
It changes the way they had
to play it in slow motion.

2007
02:00:33,100 --> 02:00:36,400
So that right there we're looking
at an octopus. Yeah. That is insane.

2008
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:40,630
That's insane. That is fucking
insane. That is a goddamn alien.

2009
02:00:40,780 --> 02:00:42,980
And then he shoots watching Fox appears.
Yeah.

2010
02:00:43,210 --> 02:00:46,900
So he follows it and then
it does it again. Boom,

2011
02:00:47,740 --> 02:00:51,220
clunk down. Cause they're now, now
if you were looking down on it,

2012
02:00:51,250 --> 02:00:53,980
it's matching the,
the spots and everything in the ground.

2013
02:00:54,280 --> 02:00:58,300
That is insane.
That is insane.

2014
02:00:59,050 --> 02:01:02,050
So now it's a slow motion version of it.

2015
02:01:02,051 --> 02:01:04,690
I want to see the fast motion version
of it again cause it doesn't even make

2016
02:01:04,691 --> 02:01:08,470
sense. But the slow motion version
is really cool too. Like right.

2017
02:01:08,500 --> 02:01:13,420
We're looking at this thing and I
swear it has all the bumps of allergy.

2018
02:01:13,570 --> 02:01:18,570
It looks like the Predator like from
the movie when it becomes the octopus of

2019
02:01:18,900 --> 02:01:21,160
cloaking mechanism,
we can't think about all the,

2020
02:01:21,250 --> 02:01:23,560
that's what I was talking about earlier.
As far as camouflage goes,

2021
02:01:23,800 --> 02:01:27,880
we put so much science into
camouflage and this is,

2022
02:01:28,660 --> 02:01:31,240
this is the Ed,
all Beal of camouflage.

2023
02:01:31,241 --> 02:01:34,390
If we could figure that out as
far as any application for it,

2024
02:01:34,391 --> 02:01:39,010
that's what we aspire to. And yet with all
of our technology, I hopped in a plane,

2025
02:01:39,110 --> 02:01:39,980
flew all this way

2026
02:01:39,980 --> 02:01:41,750
while I was,
you know,

2027
02:01:41,990 --> 02:01:45,560
emailing someone across the
country simultaneously. Yet.

2028
02:01:45,561 --> 02:01:48,620
We can't figure out how the
octopus does that. I have no idea.

2029
02:01:48,621 --> 02:01:52,190
I had no idea because I mean,
we're not exaggerating this folks,

2030
02:01:52,191 --> 02:01:55,640
if you're watching this or if you're
listening, you really have to watch this.

2031
02:01:55,790 --> 02:01:58,040
I've never seen this before.
Isn't it crazy? So we, we,

2032
02:01:58,041 --> 02:01:59,030
so one of the things is like,

2033
02:01:59,031 --> 02:02:02,870
we brought this to light in the show
is this is the fact that people should

2034
02:02:02,871 --> 02:02:06,380
learn about the octopus and it's not like
a thing it does every once in a while.

2035
02:02:06,381 --> 02:02:10,700
It does it constantly. It's always
doing that. Look at this one. Whoa.

2036
02:02:11,990 --> 02:02:16,250
And every species of octopus
fucking colors, man. Crazy.

2037
02:02:16,340 --> 02:02:20,990
This is incredible. The
shapes, it's amazing.

2038
02:02:21,200 --> 02:02:23,840
Well,
there's so follow Jesus Christ.

2039
02:02:24,320 --> 02:02:28,660
They just turns into some stripe. The
also make themselves look like another,

2040
02:02:28,710 --> 02:02:32,300
like almost looked like a predator.
So if something bigger is coming at them,

2041
02:02:32,301 --> 02:02:36,770
they'll boom flash and make like an I and
crazy stuff to, to protect themselves.

2042
02:02:36,800 --> 02:02:40,520
Wow. I almost feel bad eating them,
but they're my favorite Sushi. Yeah.

2043
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:44,230
I don't really enjoy them. That's
it's okay. They're cool. They,

2044
02:02:44,420 --> 02:02:48,950
they live in a very short lives as
well and their, their brain capacity,

2045
02:02:49,250 --> 02:02:53,480
they advance so fast.
An octopus lives about two years.

2046
02:02:53,930 --> 02:02:54,710
That's it.

2047
02:02:54,710 --> 02:02:59,120
Even these giant Pacific octopus maybe
I get well like I just think they live,

2048
02:02:59,121 --> 02:03:02,660
I can't remember exactly three, four
years maybe tops. That's it. Yeah,

2049
02:03:02,690 --> 02:03:03,600
and then but they,

2050
02:03:03,630 --> 02:03:08,630
they learn rapidly like they can figure
out what the fuck is that as an octopus,

2051
02:03:09,200 --> 02:03:10,860
what the fuck is that?
It's,

2052
02:03:11,150 --> 02:03:16,150
it looks like a bear with an allergy suit
on and it's running on two legs while

2053
02:03:16,461 --> 02:03:18,860
looking like a stick
while looking like some,

2054
02:03:18,861 --> 02:03:23,270
some piece of floating coral or or some,

2055
02:03:23,271 --> 02:03:27,530
some plant matter. That is insane.
I literally had no idea. Yeah,

2056
02:03:27,890 --> 02:03:28,460
that's the most,

2057
02:03:28,460 --> 02:03:31,250
that's probably one of the most amazing
things I discovered while doing this

2058
02:03:31,251 --> 02:03:32,360
shit or just like did you

2059
02:03:34,400 --> 02:03:38,240
not to this capacity and I'm thinking
to myself like, how did I not know?

2060
02:03:38,270 --> 02:03:42,570
I feel like I know a decent amount
about a lot of things there.

2061
02:03:42,640 --> 02:03:44,750
There should be,
I wish I could find the,

2062
02:03:44,960 --> 02:03:46,940
I wish we had that
episode going right now.

2063
02:03:47,060 --> 02:03:51,800
It's going to air here in a few
weeks. Well when it airs, um,

2064
02:03:52,100 --> 02:03:55,850
texts me like when that one's
going to hear the next day we'll,

2065
02:03:56,120 --> 02:03:59,470
we'll play some clips from and if we can,
you guys won't pull us off you cube,

2066
02:03:59,471 --> 02:04:00,230
right?
Nah,

2067
02:04:00,230 --> 02:04:05,230
you can do whatever you want this off
youtube that I really had no idea.

2068
02:04:06,980 --> 02:04:10,790
Look, click at that man. I thought
they just became like the color.

2069
02:04:11,090 --> 02:04:13,480
I didn't know that they could
assume EIP and everything.

2070
02:04:13,490 --> 02:04:17,090
The texture of algae and when we're
talking about the texture of algae,

2071
02:04:17,091 --> 02:04:18,080
we're not exaggerating.

2072
02:04:18,081 --> 02:04:23,081
I mean it looks like leaves and it
goes to the scene and then goes back.

2073
02:04:23,900 --> 02:04:28,900
Look at the speed that it changes
instantaneous God instant and the really

2074
02:04:32,211 --> 02:04:35,990
fucking smart too. That's the other
weird. So we were, we were in the,

2075
02:04:36,360 --> 02:04:39,750
this wasn't the show so I don't mind
talking about it because there is this one

2076
02:04:39,751 --> 02:04:42,600
octopus and we had, we were just kind
of like messing with them. The graph,

2077
02:04:42,810 --> 02:04:46,830
you know, there's suckers are pretty
strong and on you. And we had this,

2078
02:04:46,860 --> 02:04:50,940
we would use these little pieces of fish
and there's this thing that was like a

2079
02:04:50,941 --> 02:04:53,280
wand where we could kind of lure it out.

2080
02:04:53,610 --> 02:04:58,380
Well it had figured out the fish was
sitting up on the top of the tank.

2081
02:04:58,620 --> 02:05:03,480
So it like distracted us by grabbing
the wand and as we're doing this arm

2082
02:05:03,481 --> 02:05:06,540
reaches up, grabs the whole dish and
brings it in. It's like, screw you guys,

2083
02:05:06,541 --> 02:05:11,220
I'm not playing your game anymore. It
was so weird, like smarter than I was.

2084
02:05:11,400 --> 02:05:14,940
Well, you've heard about the um,
the fish tank that was missing.

2085
02:05:14,970 --> 02:05:18,390
The guy was missing like
some real expensive tropical
fish and he had two fish

2086
02:05:18,391 --> 02:05:22,890
tanks across from each other and they set
up a camera and he watched the octopus

2087
02:05:22,891 --> 02:05:27,210
climb out of one tank, go across
the floor, climb up the other tank,

2088
02:05:27,211 --> 02:05:30,540
lift up the lid, climbing
side, jack the fish, eat it,

2089
02:05:30,810 --> 02:05:35,550
climb back out of the tank, go across the
floor again, back into his tank. Yeah.

2090
02:05:35,551 --> 02:05:39,220
The, the Denver Aquarium where
we did this episode at, uh,

2091
02:05:39,540 --> 02:05:41,760
had locks on the octopus tank top.

2092
02:05:42,270 --> 02:05:45,450
Padlocks get that man.

2093
02:05:45,960 --> 02:05:50,550
It makes you wonder like what kind of
life is out there in the universe if this

2094
02:05:50,551 --> 02:05:55,140
is on our own planet and that is an alien.
It's weird and I've,

2095
02:05:55,240 --> 02:05:58,760
I've heard they configure it, if
you put it off, should look at this

2096
02:06:01,050 --> 02:06:02,790
dude,
if you saw that on the ground,

2097
02:06:02,960 --> 02:06:06,450
if something just popped up like that
on the ground and looked like that,

2098
02:06:06,451 --> 02:06:09,510
you'd say, Oh, this is obviously some
sort of a poisonous fucking monster.

2099
02:06:09,570 --> 02:06:10,770
I got to run away from this thing.

2100
02:06:10,920 --> 02:06:13,830
And they'll change based on
thinking predators are after him.

2101
02:06:13,831 --> 02:06:17,190
And it looks like a, a poison.
It's moray eel right there.

2102
02:06:17,191 --> 02:06:21,000
It's like white or
black and white stripes.

2103
02:06:22,140 --> 02:06:26,730
And then the fact that it can go from
black and white stripes to all tan and

2104
02:06:26,731 --> 02:06:30,540
looking like a piece of coral
to green and look like algae.

2105
02:06:30,990 --> 02:06:35,010
It's pretty fucked up. Fuck.
Look at that. The crabs like,

2106
02:06:35,011 --> 02:06:38,600
hey bitch puffing his body up
to look bigger. Yeah, it's,

2107
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:42,570
well it's going to eat that crap so
it's going to do the crap knows it too.

2108
02:06:42,750 --> 02:06:44,040
That's the fucked up thing about it.

2109
02:06:44,041 --> 02:06:47,910
They'll jack crabs and lobsters and
shit and they just engulf them and then

2110
02:06:47,970 --> 02:06:52,900
inside of them they have this
beak. Yeah. Have you seen the um,

2111
02:06:52,960 --> 02:06:56,430
the evidence of the cracking that
they found the fossil evidence? No.

2112
02:06:56,970 --> 02:07:00,420
Pull that shit up, Jamie.
They recently discovered,

2113
02:07:00,421 --> 02:07:05,160
I think within the last five or six
years they discovered these fossilized a

2114
02:07:05,161 --> 02:07:08,760
suction cups from an enormous octopus.

2115
02:07:09,180 --> 02:07:11,370
And they think that at one point in time,

2116
02:07:11,371 --> 02:07:16,371
the idea of the crackin like that was
like always a mythological creature.

2117
02:07:17,650 --> 02:07:21,570
If there was some enormous octopus that
would take out boats and shit and kill

2118
02:07:21,571 --> 02:07:25,320
people, they think there really was
something that was that big. Now, well,

2119
02:07:25,321 --> 02:07:29,010
there's [inaudible] species of like even
giant squid that we've never actually

2120
02:07:29,011 --> 02:07:33,330
seen alive. Maybe now we have, but believe
we've seen a few of them now, but yeah,

2121
02:07:33,400 --> 02:07:35,830
but they're really recently,
like within the last decade,

2122
02:07:35,990 --> 02:07:36,823
like,
look at that.

2123
02:07:36,910 --> 02:07:41,050
They think this is from
a 100 foot long octopus.

2124
02:07:41,440 --> 02:07:46,120
It's a fossil. You can imagine a 100 foot
octopus that it's as smart as they are.

2125
02:07:46,270 --> 02:07:50,000
They would kind of tap one side of the
boat is you go look over the there.

2126
02:07:50,070 --> 02:07:53,620
So yeah, I'm sure it's crazy. Well they
probably Jack people that have boats,

2127
02:07:53,650 --> 02:07:55,930
they probably really did.
If they found out they can eat people,

2128
02:07:56,140 --> 02:08:00,210
I mean look a person, especially
back then people were tiny, you know,

2129
02:08:00,280 --> 02:08:04,360
like the average Roman soldier I think
was only like five foot two or something

2130
02:08:04,361 --> 02:08:05,770
like that or five foot three.

2131
02:08:06,070 --> 02:08:09,130
There were people who were really a little
back then like the civil war and the

2132
02:08:09,131 --> 02:08:13,240
civil war. The average man that was
fighting the civil war, it was 130 pounds.

2133
02:08:13,810 --> 02:08:17,330
They were like tiny little people because
nobody, I need fucking food. Yeah.

2134
02:08:18,750 --> 02:08:20,140
They hadn't figured out,
probably hunting.

2135
02:08:20,141 --> 02:08:23,920
They weren't Ricky recreationally
working out either. There was no,

2136
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:28,900
there was no, uh, you know, weight
gaining powder that you buy in GNC.

2137
02:08:28,990 --> 02:08:33,990
There's no one was doing squats and the
these fucking giant 100 foot octopus

2138
02:08:34,600 --> 02:08:37,930
probably with Jack. Those people. I mean,
it only makes sense. They would just,

2139
02:08:38,140 --> 02:08:41,290
why would they, they don't have
morals, you know the idea that, well,

2140
02:08:41,291 --> 02:08:45,640
the humans who are friends now,
it flipped that boat over.

2141
02:08:45,910 --> 02:08:50,110
You might be imagined just looking in
the water and seeing a 100 foot octopus.

2142
02:08:50,290 --> 02:08:55,180
I mean a 100 foot of octopus is many times
bigger than the room we're in, right?

2143
02:08:56,160 --> 02:09:00,160
Yeah. And they, they changed their
size to, they fill up, I mean

2144
02:09:02,140 --> 02:09:07,120
crazy room. We're in, man. How was the
door? Door to door here from here to here?

2145
02:09:07,121 --> 02:09:11,470
How big is this place? I wonder
would it be 20 feet? 20 feet,

2146
02:09:11,540 --> 02:09:16,270
maybe write five times bigger than that.
I'll fucking octopus.

2147
02:09:16,390 --> 02:09:20,890
That's crazy. Jesus. Jamie, is
that just it's head or it's like,

2148
02:09:20,930 --> 02:09:25,380
it's whole body tip to tip tip to ahead
as they found it in Nevada too. Oh,

2149
02:09:25,390 --> 02:09:28,600
Jesus.
Like the Berlin thesaurus area.

2150
02:09:28,630 --> 02:09:31,330
So probably if they found it in Nevada,

2151
02:09:31,331 --> 02:09:34,000
that means Nevada was probably
underwater. Just like, uh,

2152
02:09:34,360 --> 02:09:39,010
parts of Montana that they keep finding
great base and like it was the largest

2153
02:09:39,011 --> 02:09:42,490
lake in North America. Look
at that man. Look at that.

2154
02:09:43,120 --> 02:09:45,300
It cathar how'd he say that?

2155
02:09:45,620 --> 02:09:50,620
He is sore state park in Nevada may be
a part of the beak of an ancient giant

2156
02:09:51,071 --> 02:09:53,550
cephalopod such as an octopus or squid.

2157
02:09:54,730 --> 02:09:58,480
What I used to go there,
look around as a kid.

2158
02:09:58,690 --> 02:10:03,160
He'd find the cool stuff. You okay.
So this was 2013 they found this.

2159
02:10:03,550 --> 02:10:06,330
So it makes it, that's what I
was reading this thing about. Um,

2160
02:10:06,520 --> 02:10:10,240
it was on dig and you know,
dig is a great a website,

2161
02:10:10,241 --> 02:10:14,110
like a portal to a bunch of
other like really cool articles.

2162
02:10:14,410 --> 02:10:17,320
And it had one of them where they were
saying that we'll never find all the

2163
02:10:17,321 --> 02:10:19,930
dinosaurs because of the
nature of gathering fossils,

2164
02:10:20,500 --> 02:10:25,360
fossils they find apparently CV can find
that article because I don't want to

2165
02:10:25,390 --> 02:10:26,223
misquote it,

2166
02:10:26,410 --> 02:10:31,410
but I think they were saying that they
find two new species of dinosaur a month.

2167
02:10:32,200 --> 02:10:34,850
Wow. Yeah. Yeah. Like what?

2168
02:10:35,500 --> 02:10:39,980
So I think the name of the article is
you will never find all the dinosaurs,

2169
02:10:40,550 --> 02:10:43,000
but uh, I think that was one of the
things that they were saying was there.

2170
02:10:43,010 --> 02:10:44,630
So many dinosaurs we're finding,

2171
02:10:44,631 --> 02:10:48,650
but the nature of a fossil
being discovered like,

2172
02:10:48,950 --> 02:10:53,870
or created rather like most when we die,
most likely we will not be fossils.

2173
02:10:53,900 --> 02:10:58,400
We'll just rot and then we'll get eaten
by bacteria or whatever and rodents and

2174
02:10:58,460 --> 02:11:00,800
whoever the fuck he eats our bones.
And that'll be the end of it.

2175
02:11:01,220 --> 02:11:05,720
Like if you leave, I mean, I'm sure many
times you've stumbled across some bones,

2176
02:11:05,830 --> 02:11:08,870
uh, out in the woods. There
were some animal and you know,

2177
02:11:08,900 --> 02:11:12,440
what you're saying is just like what
remains and if you came back in 10 years,

2178
02:11:12,441 --> 02:11:15,770
that'll be gone too. Yeah, well
think about a million years.

2179
02:11:15,830 --> 02:11:19,640
Think about 10 million years now.
Think about 65 million years.

2180
02:11:19,641 --> 02:11:23,750
The last time we had dinosaurs,
now think about 250 million years.

2181
02:11:23,751 --> 02:11:26,840
It was another extinction event.
So look at that.

2182
02:11:27,640 --> 02:11:30,520
So yeah, cc, if you find the, um, what,

2183
02:11:30,600 --> 02:11:33,260
what the number is because
if you scroll down,

2184
02:11:33,530 --> 02:11:36,650
they were talking about it was
what part of the article was, um,

2185
02:11:37,070 --> 02:11:41,030
how often they find,
this is not the same article,

2186
02:11:41,031 --> 02:11:45,950
although it has the same. Um, just I
think it's the same, uh, you know, the,

2187
02:11:45,960 --> 02:11:48,550
it might've been an
aggregate thing where they,

2188
02:11:48,640 --> 02:11:53,150
they took it from one scientific study
and made a bunch of articles about the,

2189
02:11:53,151 --> 02:11:57,200
uh, w with the same title, but
they, they don't know. They don't,

2190
02:11:57,201 --> 02:11:59,210
they don't know how many a
good dinosaurs they were.

2191
02:11:59,211 --> 02:12:00,980
They don't know what the
fuck they all looked like.

2192
02:12:01,520 --> 02:12:04,880
It's probably a shitload of them that
everybody ate and they can't find any

2193
02:12:04,881 --> 02:12:08,630
fossils that like,
like the chickens of the dinosaur world.

2194
02:12:08,631 --> 02:12:11,930
Like good luck finding them the
bottom of the food chain. Well,

2195
02:12:11,931 --> 02:12:15,500
that's why it's amazing to me when they
find something like that hobbit person,

2196
02:12:15,710 --> 02:12:18,410
you know, that thing that they
found in the island of Flores.

2197
02:12:18,440 --> 02:12:20,120
Do you know about all that?
I heard about it.

2198
02:12:20,540 --> 02:12:25,490
It was 13,000 years ago was
the mo the, the closest, uh,

2199
02:12:25,491 --> 02:12:27,320
one of the most recent one rather.

2200
02:12:27,470 --> 02:12:31,790
And it was a tiny little human type thing
that was like three feet tall when it

2201
02:12:31,791 --> 02:12:36,620
was fully grown and it was
like humanoid and it would,

2202
02:12:36,650 --> 02:12:41,440
it was smaller brain than a
human, but yeah, like a Hobbit,

2203
02:12:41,441 --> 02:12:45,770
but it wasn't like, uh, like door FISM
you know, now. Well that was, that was a,

2204
02:12:45,771 --> 02:12:48,650
there was a debate about that, but then
they found enough fossils are, they said,

2205
02:12:48,680 --> 02:12:52,640
nope, this is a totally different thing.
They, at first they were saying, you know,

2206
02:12:52,650 --> 02:12:56,150
first I think the first,
first uh, discovery,

2207
02:12:56,151 --> 02:12:57,830
they were saying this is a new species,

2208
02:12:58,130 --> 02:13:00,200
but they were pretty cautious about
it and they were saying, well,

2209
02:13:00,201 --> 02:13:02,120
it might be someone that has
some sort of a weird disease.

2210
02:13:02,300 --> 02:13:05,420
Then they found a bunch of them and
then there's some speculation that they

2211
02:13:05,421 --> 02:13:08,630
believe they're wiped out by people
because they were cannibalizing people.

2212
02:13:08,910 --> 02:13:12,260
They were, they were coming after
people and people coming after them.

2213
02:13:12,261 --> 02:13:16,730
And it's a war between the US.
Yeah. Little hobbits at eat people.

2214
02:13:17,270 --> 02:13:19,820
I don't know if they know about
that might be all horse shit though.

2215
02:13:19,821 --> 02:13:24,110
That might be just total speculation. I
would speculate too. Why not. Exactly,

2216
02:13:24,170 --> 02:13:28,310
but I mean exactly like what you're
talking about with the giant crack and the

2217
02:13:28,311 --> 02:13:31,650
giant octopus. Of course it would
eat people. Everything we do, people,

2218
02:13:31,830 --> 02:13:35,150
we have this weird idea because we
live in cities and like, you know,

2219
02:13:35,160 --> 02:13:38,640
we think of hippos as being some thing
with a Tutu on and a fucking bow and it's

2220
02:13:38,641 --> 02:13:41,910
hair. Well, they don't want to
eat us well of course they do.

2221
02:13:42,210 --> 02:13:44,940
They want to eat everything they can eat.
If they can eat you,

2222
02:13:44,941 --> 02:13:45,870
they definitely want to eat you.

2223
02:13:45,871 --> 02:13:48,860
They don't not want to eat you because
you have a beard and you have an iPhone.

2224
02:13:49,290 --> 02:13:53,400
You know the ones that
could really inflict damage
though for some reason don't

2225
02:13:53,410 --> 02:13:57,990
eat the one I'm most scared
about. Killer whales. Yeah,

2226
02:13:57,991 --> 02:13:59,220
there they are so smart.

2227
02:13:59,400 --> 02:14:02,610
If they decided to just all
of a sudden gang up on humans,

2228
02:14:02,680 --> 02:14:05,580
we would be at such a loss.
We would never go in the ocean again.

2229
02:14:06,210 --> 02:14:07,043
We'd be fog as smart.

2230
02:14:07,170 --> 02:14:10,350
As long as Netflix stays out of the
ocean and they watch a black blackfish,

2231
02:14:10,680 --> 02:14:14,970
we're safe. But as soon as they find out
what happened at the end of that movie,

2232
02:14:16,620 --> 02:14:18,650
it's so fucking done.
Yeah,

2233
02:14:18,970 --> 02:14:23,760
well it's so crazy that we still keep
them in captivity because we've always

2234
02:14:23,761 --> 02:14:28,500
kept them in captivity because if we
didn't ever have them captive and we

2235
02:14:28,501 --> 02:14:31,170
discovered them in the ocean,
these super intelligent creatures,

2236
02:14:31,171 --> 02:14:35,010
and we found out about their capabilities,
we found out about their language,

2237
02:14:35,020 --> 02:14:36,120
the fact they have dialects,

2238
02:14:36,121 --> 02:14:39,810
the fact they live in these
complex ordered societies,

2239
02:14:39,811 --> 02:14:42,300
they stay with the same pod for life.

2240
02:14:42,570 --> 02:14:47,520
They have family like deep connect
connections with these other orchids that

2241
02:14:47,521 --> 02:14:49,950
they consider their family.
I mean, we just steal them.

2242
02:14:50,140 --> 02:14:51,000
Steelman stick them in a fish,

2243
02:14:51,001 --> 02:14:55,410
communicate across the oceans through
essentially whale internet. Yeah.

2244
02:14:55,460 --> 02:14:57,660
That's not crazy.
And then we're assholes.

2245
02:14:57,661 --> 02:15:01,320
We stick them in a tank and fat people
eat cotton candy and stare at him.

2246
02:15:02,600 --> 02:15:05,700
Make it job lawyer.
This is a rip off.

2247
02:15:07,600 --> 02:15:11,250
We're assholes. We're, we're
fucking really shitty animals too.

2248
02:15:11,251 --> 02:15:15,010
To do that to Wales. And to killer
whales and it's really shitty. Yeah.

2249
02:15:15,540 --> 02:15:19,080
Well there was a, um, a thing that
a, I was listening to this Ted talk,

2250
02:15:19,260 --> 02:15:23,750
whether they were talking about
a sustainable organisms and um,

2251
02:15:24,030 --> 02:15:29,030
that a lot of the logic that we apply
to a hunting and trapping some organisms

2252
02:15:31,171 --> 02:15:33,870
thinking that we're going to help the
food chain out doesn't wind up helping.

2253
02:15:34,170 --> 02:15:37,980
And one of them was whales that
the Japanese had made this idea.

2254
02:15:37,980 --> 02:15:41,250
They had this idea,
well if we a hunt,

2255
02:15:41,251 --> 02:15:45,150
a certain amount of whales will have
more fish and more krill because the

2256
02:15:45,151 --> 02:15:48,330
Japanese eat all these krill or the
whales rather eat all these krill.

2257
02:15:48,480 --> 02:15:51,480
And if we hunt the whales, it'll help
the krill and the fish population.

2258
02:15:51,810 --> 02:15:55,770
But apparently that's not the case
because one of the reasons why there's so

2259
02:15:55,771 --> 02:15:58,050
much krill is because of the whales,

2260
02:15:58,200 --> 02:16:02,160
because the whales will let
loose these enormous shits.

2261
02:16:02,580 --> 02:16:06,300
They come up and just shit these
giant clouds of whale shit.

2262
02:16:06,480 --> 02:16:08,100
And algae grows from that.

2263
02:16:08,250 --> 02:16:11,700
And then the krill are attracted to the
algae and the krill eat the algae and

2264
02:16:11,701 --> 02:16:13,650
they, they, they, that's
what sustains them.

2265
02:16:13,890 --> 02:16:15,750
So when they started hunting the whales,

2266
02:16:16,110 --> 02:16:20,730
it actually lowered the population of
Krill and they ha they had to like put it

2267
02:16:20,731 --> 02:16:24,420
all together. That's a
crazy cycle. We didn't,

2268
02:16:24,421 --> 02:16:28,890
we never really know what we're
messing with. Think we know. So,

2269
02:16:29,620 --> 02:16:30,010
and that's the

2270
02:16:30,010 --> 02:16:33,990
thing. One of the things I, you know,
people might say that aren't into hunting,

2271
02:16:34,270 --> 02:16:36,850
well let's just leave it the way it was,

2272
02:16:37,450 --> 02:16:41,170
release all the wolves and then let
nature take care of itself. But that's,

2273
02:16:41,670 --> 02:16:43,150
it's an impossible,

2274
02:16:44,260 --> 02:16:49,260
it's an impossible thing because we've
already affected the landscape so much

2275
02:16:50,140 --> 02:16:51,550
that nothing,
I mean,

2276
02:16:51,551 --> 02:16:56,551
especially with non native species
and invasive plants and habitat,

2277
02:16:56,950 --> 02:17:01,900
deforestation and so many other things
that affect the thought of just like

2278
02:17:01,901 --> 02:17:05,050
letting me chair run itself
isn't even an option now.

2279
02:17:05,051 --> 02:17:09,160
And then you even look at it even further
and go like human hunters have been in

2280
02:17:09,161 --> 02:17:13,300
the equation since all of these
animals have been here. When,

2281
02:17:13,750 --> 02:17:16,450
when is the elk existed?
When humans haven't hunted it?

2282
02:17:16,990 --> 02:17:18,820
I don't know an answer to
that because there isn't one.

2283
02:17:18,880 --> 02:17:22,330
Well, no one knows the answer.
Yeah. To go past 10,000 years,

2284
02:17:22,331 --> 02:17:23,740
you'd have to go across the ice age.

2285
02:17:23,990 --> 02:17:24,980
Right? It's like, well,

2286
02:17:25,280 --> 02:17:29,960
the wolves were not the only predators
on North America since humans have been

2287
02:17:29,961 --> 02:17:30,950
here.
No.

2288
02:17:31,380 --> 02:17:34,010
Well, there was lions. Yeah.
You know, there was a kinds of,

2289
02:17:34,030 --> 02:17:38,880
we're going to bring back that we're
going to find that lion or find some DNA

2290
02:17:38,881 --> 02:17:42,540
from it and bring it back from extinction
that we don't even know why those

2291
02:17:42,541 --> 02:17:46,530
things went extinct. Nobody
bothered to write that down.
Oh, we did that. You know,

2292
02:17:46,531 --> 02:17:47,940
they know what nobody knows.

2293
02:17:47,970 --> 02:17:50,670
Even there's still debate as to
what happened to the woolly mammoth.

2294
02:17:50,970 --> 02:17:52,890
Some people still think
that it was humans.

2295
02:17:53,130 --> 02:17:56,400
There was some paper that was recently
published that was saying that there was

2296
02:17:56,401 --> 02:18:01,401
evidence that they were coming into estrus
younger and younger and that this was

2297
02:18:02,551 --> 02:18:05,070
because of hunting pressure. They believe
it was because of hunting pressure.

2298
02:18:06,150 --> 02:18:08,490
Could it be pure speculation
or predators as well?

2299
02:18:08,780 --> 02:18:11,980
Could be, but there was, there
was, it was pure speculation.

2300
02:18:12,010 --> 02:18:14,440
I mean mixed with some evidence,

2301
02:18:14,441 --> 02:18:18,730
but there's also some evidence that they
died in a giant mass extinction that

2302
02:18:18,731 --> 02:18:22,200
people like Randall Carlson of connected
to an asteroid will impact. Hmm.

2303
02:18:22,450 --> 02:18:24,430
And it was also a the same,

2304
02:18:24,850 --> 02:18:27,910
roughly the same time period
as the end of the ice age.

2305
02:18:28,120 --> 02:18:32,890
So they think that asteroidal impacts
slammed into the earth and, and not,

2306
02:18:32,950 --> 02:18:34,540
not just even global warming,

2307
02:18:34,541 --> 02:18:38,590
but just massive asteroidal
impacts all over the planet.

2308
02:18:38,860 --> 02:18:43,570
That there was some sort of a mass
extinction event worldwide that coincided

2309
02:18:43,571 --> 02:18:46,560
with the end of the ice age and the um,

2310
02:18:46,990 --> 02:18:51,990
the different errors of construction
methods for things like the old kingdom in

2311
02:18:52,931 --> 02:18:54,370
Egypt.
Um,

2312
02:18:54,460 --> 02:18:59,080
giant archeological digs like
go Beckley Tepi I'm having,

2313
02:18:59,340 --> 02:19:03,520
um, Randall Carlson and
this Guy Graham Hancock on,

2314
02:19:03,790 --> 02:19:06,730
they're going to be on
November 19th. And, uh,

2315
02:19:06,910 --> 02:19:10,420
Graham Hancock just wrote a book about
it called the magicians of the gods.

2316
02:19:10,660 --> 02:19:13,210
And he had an old one
that was a super popular,

2317
02:19:13,211 --> 02:19:16,690
it's sold like millions and millions of
copies called fingerprints of the gods

2318
02:19:17,110 --> 02:19:22,110
and that it's all basically asserting
back then he was trying to put the pieces

2319
02:19:22,421 --> 02:19:25,630
together and saying there are,
there's evidence of lost civilization.

2320
02:19:25,631 --> 02:19:26,830
And the way he described it,
he said,

2321
02:19:26,831 --> 02:19:29,630
we are essentially a
civilization with amnesia.

2322
02:19:30,110 --> 02:19:32,720
And that something happened
somewhere along the line.

2323
02:19:32,930 --> 02:19:35,410
And there's all this evidence of
these ancient structures that were,

2324
02:19:35,430 --> 02:19:40,250
that were made by advanced civilizations.
We really don't have any idea. Yeah.

2325
02:19:40,600 --> 02:19:45,360
It makes sense that natural disasters
did it. That there's some sort.

2326
02:19:45,400 --> 02:19:50,270
And then between the time of him
publishing that book and, uh,

2327
02:19:50,271 --> 02:19:53,960
Randall Carlson coming around and Randall
Carlson has been dedicated his whole

2328
02:19:53,961 --> 02:19:55,380
life to,
um,

2329
02:19:55,430 --> 02:20:00,430
researching asteroidal impacts and natural
disasters that are caused by a global

2330
02:20:00,890 --> 02:20:04,040
collisions. You know, things coming from
the sky and slamming into the earth.

2331
02:20:04,370 --> 02:20:06,410
But he's a,
he's a master Ma,

2332
02:20:06,480 --> 02:20:11,330
a giant database of factual
evidence that, uh, you know,

2333
02:20:11,331 --> 02:20:14,390
from other sources.
So it's not like him finding this stuff,

2334
02:20:14,391 --> 02:20:18,200
but it's like they're, they're discovered
things like [inaudible], which is a,

2335
02:20:18,201 --> 02:20:19,160
I think that I'm saying it right,

2336
02:20:19,370 --> 02:20:24,370
but it's a nuclear glass and all over
Europe and Asia and when they do those

2337
02:20:24,831 --> 02:20:29,420
core samples of the earth,
it cuts down around 12,000 years and that,

2338
02:20:29,510 --> 02:20:32,960
that nuclear glass happens
when they do nuclear tests,

2339
02:20:33,110 --> 02:20:35,420
but it also happens when
meteors impact the earth.

2340
02:20:35,870 --> 02:20:39,530
So they found this shit all over
the place at about 12,000 years,

2341
02:20:40,170 --> 02:20:42,230
which means there was just a fucking,

2342
02:20:42,910 --> 02:20:45,680
we were a shooting
gallery 12,000 years ago,

2343
02:20:45,710 --> 02:20:48,200
which is crazy to think like
we're so stable right now.

2344
02:20:48,230 --> 02:20:52,640
And then one meteor could ruin it and
then we get need to get really good with

2345
02:20:52,641 --> 02:20:56,900
those crossbows. Yeah, we've
got to make her own sticks.

2346
02:20:57,240 --> 02:20:59,150
And if you're living in a place like La,

2347
02:20:59,151 --> 02:21:00,890
you're going to have to
start fighting off people.

2348
02:21:00,920 --> 02:21:05,030
It was not going to be enough
food. No, there's enough people,

2349
02:21:05,031 --> 02:21:08,870
I guess we're going to have to start
eating them, eat the fat, slow on staying.

2350
02:21:08,900 --> 02:21:11,810
I'll stay in the mountains for that
one. Yeah, that's a good way. Like, Hey,

2351
02:21:11,811 --> 02:21:14,630
want to come down and do a
podcast during the apocalypse?

2352
02:21:15,900 --> 02:21:17,090
And I do it from my phone.

2353
02:21:17,660 --> 02:21:20,450
Well that's the other thing is
that once the power goes out,

2354
02:21:20,451 --> 02:21:22,820
we're not gonna have any
access to hard drives.

2355
02:21:22,821 --> 02:21:24,680
We're not going to have
any access to phones.

2356
02:21:24,681 --> 02:21:26,570
We're not going to have
any access to the grid.

2357
02:21:26,750 --> 02:21:30,170
And if the grid is out for more than a
couple of years, it's going to stay out.

2358
02:21:30,560 --> 02:21:32,780
No one, you don't know how to fix
it. I don't know how to fix it.

2359
02:21:32,810 --> 02:21:35,090
I have no clue how the things I use work.

2360
02:21:35,330 --> 02:21:39,800
If we killed off 70% of the population,
we will be right back to the stone age.

2361
02:21:40,310 --> 02:21:44,540
Because the idea that those 30% that we
will be lucky enough to have people who

2362
02:21:44,541 --> 02:21:47,900
are so innovative and so educated that
they would be able to figure out how to

2363
02:21:47,901 --> 02:21:49,880
restart civilization.
No,

2364
02:21:50,180 --> 02:21:52,950
I'm still not sure that this
phone isn't somewhat magic.

2365
02:21:54,290 --> 02:21:59,240
Does anyone know how it works? Well, it is
magic, but so is that octopus, you know,

2366
02:21:59,241 --> 02:22:03,590
and they're both made by nature.
Yeah, I mean the phone is natural.

2367
02:22:03,800 --> 02:22:06,350
It just doesn't seem natural
because people made it.

2368
02:22:06,351 --> 02:22:10,910
But people are natural and people's
curiosity is natural and the phone is just

2369
02:22:10,911 --> 02:22:14,030
as natural as a fucking beaver dam.
It really is.

2370
02:22:14,031 --> 02:22:17,810
It's just some weird thing that a natural
creature has figured out how to do

2371
02:22:17,811 --> 02:22:18,920
when given enough time,
I'm

2372
02:22:19,160 --> 02:22:21,260
add enough source material, enough, uh,

2373
02:22:21,290 --> 02:22:26,020
enough sharing information with these
other weird monkeys and one monk,

2374
02:22:26,021 --> 02:22:29,820
he figures out a diode and the other
monkey figures out how to make glass and

2375
02:22:29,821 --> 02:22:33,360
this monkey figures out how to forge
metal and this monkey figures out how to

2376
02:22:33,361 --> 02:22:36,150
write code and they all get together.
And next thing you know,

2377
02:22:36,151 --> 02:22:40,260
you've got an iPhone. Yeah. That's
cool. Or You got an octopus, you know,

2378
02:22:40,270 --> 02:22:43,590
or you got an iPhone,
you can watch it. Yeah.

2379
02:22:43,591 --> 02:22:46,950
I mean that's the other thing about
the octopus is when all this shit has

2380
02:22:46,951 --> 02:22:51,090
happened on earth as far
as, um, there was, uh,

2381
02:22:51,150 --> 02:22:54,560
I want to say where it was.
I'm trying to remember when they've,

2382
02:22:54,600 --> 02:22:58,530
they've knocked it down to, they believe
that there was one point in time,

2383
02:22:58,531 --> 02:23:03,270
there was only a few thousand human beings
left on earth. And it wasn't long ago.

2384
02:23:03,271 --> 02:23:05,100
It was like 70,000 years ago.

2385
02:23:05,340 --> 02:23:10,340
And they've coincided it
with the explosion of one
of the world's great super

2386
02:23:11,781 --> 02:23:16,650
volcanoes and that it put the earth
into nuclear winter for a long period of

2387
02:23:16,651 --> 02:23:18,960
time. Most of the plants died.
Most of the animals died.

2388
02:23:18,961 --> 02:23:21,300
A giant percentage of the
population of human beings die.

2389
02:23:21,630 --> 02:23:26,400
And that's why there's so little bio
diversity amongst human beings are genetic

2390
02:23:26,401 --> 02:23:30,920
diversity amongst human beings. I
God, I can't remember where the, um,

2391
02:23:31,140 --> 02:23:33,210
Indonesia, I want to
say, I might be wrong,

2392
02:23:33,570 --> 02:23:37,260
where the super volcano
was that went off, but, um,

2393
02:23:37,670 --> 02:23:40,830
see if you could find that
super volcano 70,000 years ago,

2394
02:23:40,831 --> 02:23:42,630
killed off giant percentage
of the population.

2395
02:23:42,810 --> 02:23:47,610
Like all these preppers are ready for
the Yellowstone super volcano and it's

2396
02:23:47,611 --> 02:23:48,300
going to be,

2397
02:23:48,300 --> 02:23:50,810
but those guys are idiots because they
go on TV and everybody knows her and

2398
02:23:50,811 --> 02:23:53,460
Pasadena, then you're just going to
fucking go right to that guy's house.

2399
02:23:53,461 --> 02:23:58,320
Cause yet canned peaches and
bullets. Was it an Indonesia? Yeah.

2400
02:23:58,620 --> 02:23:59,400
So that,

2401
02:23:59,400 --> 02:24:03,890
that Super Volcano that erupted 70,000
years ago basically almost killed the

2402
02:24:03,891 --> 02:24:07,860
sauce. We got down to a few
thousand people and uh, yeah.

2403
02:24:08,070 --> 02:24:12,240
I mean we've got real close a few
times. Yeah. So 70,000 years ago,

2404
02:24:12,241 --> 02:24:15,210
I mean obviously people weren't
that advanced, but whatever.

2405
02:24:15,450 --> 02:24:18,620
They did know they got down to nothing.
You know,

2406
02:24:18,630 --> 02:24:21,650
you get down to 2000 people if
there was 2000 of us. Yeah. It's,

2407
02:24:21,780 --> 02:24:26,770
it's a giant episode of naked and afraid.
You're like,

2408
02:24:26,790 --> 02:24:31,500
God, I remember back when I was
your age, we actually had the, yeah,

2409
02:24:31,560 --> 02:24:34,770
I mean all the shit that we have
right now that we think of as cool,

2410
02:24:34,950 --> 02:24:37,440
like televisions and all that.
I have this,

2411
02:24:37,500 --> 02:24:40,050
I have the most retarded theory
when it comes to all this stuff.

2412
02:24:40,320 --> 02:24:44,070
I think that what we're essentially
doing is preparing to give birth to an

2413
02:24:44,071 --> 02:24:46,140
artificial life.
That's what I think.

2414
02:24:46,320 --> 02:24:50,760
I think that we're essentially like a
technological cocoon and then we're going

2415
02:24:50,761 --> 02:24:54,420
to become some sort of an electronic
artificially created butterfly.

2416
02:24:54,810 --> 02:24:57,420
That's what I think. I think that's
one of the reasons why we have these,

2417
02:24:57,840 --> 02:25:02,760
these inclinations towards materialism
because materialism feeds this desire to

2418
02:25:02,761 --> 02:25:06,000
constantly innovate and continue
to come up with newer, better shit.

2419
02:25:06,360 --> 02:25:09,210
Like we were talking about with
bows, like Cam Haynes, new bow.

2420
02:25:09,510 --> 02:25:13,440
He doesn't need a bow killed two fucking
grizzly bears. His boats perfect.

2421
02:25:13,740 --> 02:25:17,790
His bows perfect. But Hoyt has to
come up with a new bow every year.

2422
02:25:17,791 --> 02:25:20,310
So they will make a bowl that's
even better than that Bo.

2423
02:25:20,490 --> 02:25:22,950
And it'll come out next year or this year.
Um,

2424
02:25:22,990 --> 02:25:27,820
but this desire to constantly innovate
and look for the biggest, bestest,

2425
02:25:27,850 --> 02:25:29,020
newest,
greatest,

2426
02:25:29,021 --> 02:25:34,021
latest thing is what causes innovation
and that innovation will ultimately lead

2427
02:25:34,601 --> 02:25:38,770
to artificial life. I just think it's
inevitable. I think if you extrapolate,

2428
02:25:38,960 --> 02:25:40,870
look where everything's going,
there's no way around it.

2429
02:25:41,110 --> 02:25:43,480
And while that's going on, I'll
still be in the mountains. Yeah.

2430
02:25:43,510 --> 02:25:47,740
You'll be out there with
a beautiful, yeah. Oh,

2431
02:25:47,830 --> 02:25:50,200
there's robots that do stuff
while I'm still out here.

2432
02:25:50,800 --> 02:25:53,470
Meanwhile mean what's more fun?
You know,

2433
02:25:53,480 --> 02:25:55,690
it was it more fun to play
video games or El Con? Well,

2434
02:25:55,691 --> 02:25:59,710
I've done both and I'll tell you right
now, El Corning is way cooler. I think so.

2435
02:25:59,860 --> 02:26:01,030
And when it's over at first of all,

2436
02:26:01,031 --> 02:26:03,340
it's way cooler than a
video game and it's real.

2437
02:26:03,670 --> 02:26:07,960
And when it's over you get to eat.
Yeah. Yeah. It's a good deal. Do when,

2438
02:26:07,990 --> 02:26:11,440
when I shot that elk that's
out there in the lobby and um,

2439
02:26:11,530 --> 02:26:16,510
it was walking up the hill and I'm hiding
behind a tree at full draw for like 30

2440
02:26:16,511 --> 02:26:19,480
seconds as it's walking up the hill.
And I know that it's going to,

2441
02:26:19,690 --> 02:26:21,800
it's just going to be within
20 yards of me and it's,

2442
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:25,780
and it's going to be right there and
it's stopping and it's a thousand pounds

2443
02:26:25,781 --> 02:26:30,520
and it's screaming
like there's nothing like that.

2444
02:26:30,550 --> 02:26:35,190
There's nothing like that. It's exciting.
Especially that clue. It's like, ah,

2445
02:26:35,210 --> 02:26:35,651
shit in,

2446
02:26:35,651 --> 02:26:38,650
they feel like they're just going to seem
like they just look right through it.

2447
02:26:38,651 --> 02:26:42,580
Yeah. Oh yeah. Well they're just
so big. Yeah. They're so big.

2448
02:26:42,790 --> 02:26:45,640
Especially sit where you're sitting
on the ground. We were standing,

2449
02:26:45,680 --> 02:26:50,650
I was standing, I was right.
We were, there's this, uh,
two trees together and, uh,

2450
02:26:50,651 --> 02:26:52,030
there was like a little gap between,

2451
02:26:52,031 --> 02:26:55,390
and we could see the elk coming up the
hill and we're like looking at him coming

2452
02:26:55,570 --> 02:26:59,860
and he was coming in hot, coming in, hot,
pissing all over himself. And, and just,

2453
02:27:00,100 --> 02:27:04,330
there was, there was a, um, it was,
we got real lucky like we went out,

2454
02:27:04,750 --> 02:27:09,550
we're at this place called to hone ranch.
And, uh, when we went out on this trail,

2455
02:27:09,730 --> 02:27:14,440
we got to this place where these elk
were fighting and they had just a couple

2456
02:27:14,441 --> 02:27:18,160
males that got together and they were
like, fuck you. No, fuck you crash.

2457
02:27:18,460 --> 02:27:21,520
And which was like some
Jurassic Park Shit.

2458
02:27:21,930 --> 02:27:25,270
Cause if even if you have
no desire to hunt folks,

2459
02:27:25,300 --> 02:27:29,710
I just encourage you around September,
find somewhere,

2460
02:27:29,711 --> 02:27:32,800
whether it's Colorado
or Utah or California,

2461
02:27:32,980 --> 02:27:36,880
anywhere where there's elk are and just
have someone take you out near them and

2462
02:27:36,881 --> 02:27:40,930
just listen. It's so cool. The
coolest sounds, they get a grip.

2463
02:27:40,960 --> 02:27:44,200
I mean they're very vocal. Very
aggressive. Yeah. That's cool.

2464
02:27:44,430 --> 02:27:47,800
We'll do it just sounds that they make,
if you've never heard them before.

2465
02:27:48,100 --> 02:27:48,933
Hi

2466
02:27:51,390 --> 02:27:55,000
Dude. That's pretty good. I recorded
them. I got a hold on a second.

2467
02:27:55,001 --> 02:27:58,270
Let me see how I can find it here.
I've got a video where I recorded it.

2468
02:27:58,780 --> 02:28:03,010
See if I get some of them when you
can hear it. The cows are cool.

2469
02:28:03,070 --> 02:28:07,700
I mean the cows even make
a weird high pitched. Yeah,
yeah, yeah. That's weird too.

2470
02:28:07,960 --> 02:28:10,150
Like they're communicating
with each other. It's a very,

2471
02:28:10,151 --> 02:28:13,780
it's a very strange animal man here.
Like I play this,

2472
02:28:20,540 --> 02:28:21,980
so that's the,
that's the

2473
02:28:21,980 --> 02:28:22,813
call.
Yeah.

2474
02:28:23,660 --> 02:28:27,260
That's my friend Brian who's making
the noise and he's trying to pull them

2475
02:28:27,290 --> 02:28:31,090
closer to us. But you hear them off in
the distance. They stay, they stuck.

2476
02:28:31,820 --> 02:28:32,653
That's it.

2477
02:28:33,590 --> 02:28:37,590
But that thing that you hear in the
background screaming at each other. Yeah.

2478
02:28:44,350 --> 02:28:45,183
Yeah.

2479
02:28:52,400 --> 02:28:56,920
That was the loud ones.
Fake. This one's real. Yeah.

2480
02:28:57,620 --> 02:29:02,600
I don't know where my best
one is, but they, they make
some weird, those red deer,

2481
02:29:02,601 --> 02:29:07,250
which are fairly related to jell. Very
similar. Do they roar instead of bugle?

2482
02:29:07,400 --> 02:29:09,040
Yeah. They sound like
lions. Yeah. They sound like

2483
02:29:14,630 --> 02:29:17,650
they look like something not a Dr
Seuss to, yeah. They don't look real.

2484
02:29:17,680 --> 02:29:19,670
Like stags don't look real.
They don't,

2485
02:29:19,960 --> 02:29:23,250
especially like Caribou don't
look really either. Yeah. Their,

2486
02:29:23,251 --> 02:29:26,300
their antlers are way too big for
their head. That looks stupid. Yeah.

2487
02:29:26,390 --> 02:29:28,880
I took my dad Caribou hunting this year.
That was really fun.

2488
02:29:29,390 --> 02:29:33,740
But any shot of big Caribou and it's
like the horn, the allergies themselves.

2489
02:29:34,460 --> 02:29:37,940
That's the hardest part to carry out cause
it's just cumbersome. Yeah, of course.

2490
02:29:38,030 --> 02:29:41,360
Awesome trees growing out
of an animal's head. Well,

2491
02:29:41,510 --> 02:29:44,030
between them and Moose and elk,

2492
02:29:44,031 --> 02:29:49,031
it's like how did this happen where they
evolved uniformly to have these like

2493
02:29:49,610 --> 02:29:54,610
super similar bizarre tree light growth
growing out of their head that they only

2494
02:29:54,921 --> 02:29:58,220
use when they're fucking, yeah. And then
they look on fucking, they lose them,

2495
02:29:58,250 --> 02:30:02,000
just gone. And then they grow them
back. Well, we found a Brian, my,

2496
02:30:02,001 --> 02:30:06,830
a friend from to home ranch found a, a
dead elk that got stabbed by another elk.

2497
02:30:07,160 --> 02:30:10,100
They were duking it out and one of them
just ran the other one through with his

2498
02:30:10,101 --> 02:30:12,260
antlers and killed him.
And he was a big elk too.

2499
02:30:12,261 --> 02:30:17,261
Like a big six by six huge thousand pound
dead elk with holes in his body from,

2500
02:30:17,600 --> 02:30:20,620
yeah, that'll happen. I've seen
like will at least read your,

2501
02:30:20,621 --> 02:30:23,000
but when they fight
and then the third one,

2502
02:30:23,001 --> 02:30:26,570
when they get in a fight with three and
the one just kind of side punches him

2503
02:30:26,571 --> 02:30:30,920
while they're fighting and sucker punches
him. Yeah. It's always that bitch. Yeah.

2504
02:30:31,160 --> 02:30:34,530
He's not even in an involved in the
fight. He's not even, he's like running.

2505
02:30:36,650 --> 02:30:39,650
It's just so crazy that this has been
going on like this for thousands of years.

2506
02:30:39,651 --> 02:30:42,230
That's how they do it.
They grow trees out of their head.

2507
02:30:42,380 --> 02:30:45,080
They smashed into each other and the
girl's like, all right, you can fuck me.

2508
02:30:45,170 --> 02:30:45,560
I liked,

2509
02:30:45,560 --> 02:30:48,530
I liked the way you tree fight for the
elk are probably looking at us going like,

2510
02:30:48,531 --> 02:30:51,500
look, they're in, dudes are
in the belly shirts now.

2511
02:30:54,970 --> 02:30:57,190
And you're like,
oh,

2512
02:30:57,230 --> 02:31:01,920
he's got the best metal box that he
drives around now. He gets to fuck. Yeah,

2513
02:31:02,190 --> 02:31:06,440
yeah. This is all, it's all nature
itself. I mean the octopus, I mean it's,

2514
02:31:06,890 --> 02:31:09,360
it's way weirder. The name thing
you'll ever see in the, yeah.

2515
02:31:09,530 --> 02:31:12,800
In the world of the ground, you know,
the, the, the land world, that's,

2516
02:31:12,860 --> 02:31:15,230
that's more bizarre than anything
I think I've ever seen in my life.

2517
02:31:15,231 --> 02:31:18,470
The ocean is really our, our largest
wilderness. I mean, it's huge.

2518
02:31:18,471 --> 02:31:21,270
I think there's a lot we don't know
about it. There's some crazy stuff.

2519
02:31:21,810 --> 02:31:25,140
I think most of the stuff, if it wasn't,
that's the thing that I think about,

2520
02:31:25,141 --> 02:31:29,670
like the crack and it's this legend door
lochness monster big foot or whatever.

2521
02:31:29,671 --> 02:31:33,840
And then once we identify
it, oh, it's, it's just an
octopus. You know what I mean?

2522
02:31:33,841 --> 02:31:36,630
If, if we didn't know octopus
existed and we were like,

2523
02:31:36,750 --> 02:31:40,650
there's this animal in the ocean that
shaped shifts and changes colors and inks

2524
02:31:40,651 --> 02:31:45,651
and can look like other animals is really
smart and we give it some crazy name,

2525
02:31:46,140 --> 02:31:48,810
you know, and then, and then we
find it and it's just normal.

2526
02:31:48,840 --> 02:31:51,540
So once we identify it
and it's a real thing,

2527
02:31:51,541 --> 02:31:54,460
it becomes boring as an octopus.
Is that,

2528
02:31:54,660 --> 02:31:58,770
what does that we have a weird desire
to only chase the unknown. I don't know.

2529
02:31:59,520 --> 02:32:01,320
That's a strange thing
when it comes to nature,

2530
02:32:01,321 --> 02:32:04,800
like the discovery of new species is,

2531
02:32:04,860 --> 02:32:08,070
it's a precedent above all.
Like they've found a new frog,

2532
02:32:08,250 --> 02:32:10,190
but at the end of the day,
it's just a fucking just frog.

2533
02:32:10,430 --> 02:32:13,050
But even if it does
the most amazing thing,

2534
02:32:13,051 --> 02:32:14,760
we've never seen the
frog did the same thing.

2535
02:32:14,761 --> 02:32:17,040
The octopus has changes its
shape and color and everything.

2536
02:32:17,550 --> 02:32:21,220
After about a week you're like, oh,
it's a frog. That changes color. Cool.

2537
02:32:21,480 --> 02:32:24,390
What's neck? Oh, there's probably
a monkey man out there. Yeah.

2538
02:32:24,391 --> 02:32:28,170
If we found big foot, that's what it would
be. Yeah. We actually found big foot.

2539
02:32:28,171 --> 02:32:29,250
It would be pretty cool,

2540
02:32:29,430 --> 02:32:33,450
but we would just open a big foot world
right next to seaworld and that would be

2541
02:32:33,590 --> 02:32:35,700
the over it. You'd be
like, oh well it's just a,

2542
02:32:35,880 --> 02:32:38,370
it's just a hairy monkey and
then we find out he's stupid.

2543
02:32:38,700 --> 02:32:42,360
He's not even as cool as the orcas and
he doesn't even like Jack Link's beef

2544
02:32:42,361 --> 02:32:46,740
jerky. Yeah, I think. And
he hates John Lithgow.

2545
02:32:48,850 --> 02:32:53,230
He sees John Lithgow. He
starts screaming bullshit.

2546
02:32:54,080 --> 02:32:54,400
Yeah.

2547
02:32:54,400 --> 02:32:58,140
That is the one disappointing thing
about my friend less drought is that he's

2548
02:32:58,200 --> 02:33:01,920
still looking for bigfoot doing
that survivor man bigfoot show.

2549
02:33:03,090 --> 02:33:05,790
I don't know. He believes in
it man. Oh I'd love that guy.

2550
02:33:05,791 --> 02:33:07,950
But the guy he goes with though,

2551
02:33:07,951 --> 02:33:11,070
I think it's a crazy fucking
total bullshit artists. I got,

2552
02:33:11,130 --> 02:33:15,150
I got approached by dude and I was at
some show somewhere at doing like a trade

2553
02:33:15,151 --> 02:33:15,984
show type thing.

2554
02:33:16,320 --> 02:33:21,320
Guys like talking to me like all serious
about how he goes and he had a business

2555
02:33:22,351 --> 02:33:24,960
card too, which makes it real. He's like,

2556
02:33:25,050 --> 02:33:30,050
I'm a squash chunter and he's talking
about the family groups and he knows their

2557
02:33:30,840 --> 02:33:32,970
intricacies and you can show me,

2558
02:33:32,971 --> 02:33:35,990
and he wants me to come out there and
film it for Solo Hunt and I was like,

2559
02:33:36,040 --> 02:33:37,650
trying to fuck you.
Yeah. I was like, dude,

2560
02:33:38,610 --> 02:33:41,900
one who's crazy or you
that you either want,

2561
02:33:41,990 --> 02:33:46,110
you either believe this bullshit
or you're just a straight up liar.

2562
02:33:46,380 --> 02:33:50,530
In which case that would make me an
idiot forever going out there. Well,

2563
02:33:50,720 --> 02:33:52,800
there's a lot of crazy
people out there for sure,

2564
02:33:52,830 --> 02:33:57,600
but it's the romantic thing about big
foot. It's just so romantic to people.

2565
02:33:57,900 --> 02:34:02,740
I had this guy tell me that it was a
government conspiracy to hide big foot

2566
02:34:03,180 --> 02:34:07,980
because of the logging industry. He
goes, think about it. Think about it.

2567
02:34:08,220 --> 02:34:12,330
They shut down the logging
industry for a spotted owl.

2568
02:34:12,480 --> 02:34:17,390
What do you think they
would do if we found a giant
monkey thank about all right.

2569
02:34:17,680 --> 02:34:19,900
I just did.
Makes no sense.

2570
02:34:21,670 --> 02:34:24,400
We'll Brunello was talking about
on his podcast recently. He's like,

2571
02:34:24,401 --> 02:34:27,340
where's the scat? Where's the shit?
Where's the, where's the droppings?

2572
02:34:27,480 --> 02:34:32,340
Like big foot would drop giant logs,
you'd find it. My thought is if I,

2573
02:34:32,560 --> 02:34:36,370
I'm out in some wild places a lot.
If I ever saw a big foot,

2574
02:34:36,790 --> 02:34:40,900
like I don't even know if I would care
that much to tell him. I'd be like, oh,

2575
02:34:40,901 --> 02:34:45,640
okay. That was cool. You know, because
you just be the crazy guy. Do you want,

2576
02:34:46,210 --> 02:34:51,100
do you want to be that guy? I don't. I'm
like, okay, well it's there. Whatever.

2577
02:34:51,190 --> 02:34:53,830
I guess who cares? Yeah. You might
want to just keep it to yourself.

2578
02:34:54,160 --> 02:34:57,430
Even if you told your friends from like
around, he's losing it fell on his head.

2579
02:34:57,900 --> 02:35:01,720
What we think as he probably like fell
on his head while he's maybe a coconut,

2580
02:35:02,290 --> 02:35:04,650
maybe got jacked by a
coconut wise out elk hunting.

2581
02:35:05,050 --> 02:35:08,150
I like my favorite is of the people
that they, there's just like walking.

2582
02:35:08,560 --> 02:35:12,340
I thought I saw something over there,
but then it wasn't there,

2583
02:35:12,341 --> 02:35:14,770
so it was a big foot.
That's my favorite.

2584
02:35:14,771 --> 02:35:19,030
I tell these people I was alone once
and I thought I saw a wolf for only two

2585
02:35:19,031 --> 02:35:22,990
seconds. It was a squirrel. Yeah. Was
this squirrel? I thought it was a wolf.

2586
02:35:23,470 --> 02:35:27,070
People driving down the road, when you
see it like a house cat and an open field,

2587
02:35:27,071 --> 02:35:30,580
it looks like a Black Panther even know
that happens all the time. At the time.

2588
02:35:30,610 --> 02:35:35,390
Lack of perspective in the distance. It
looks huge. I was talking to, they got,

2589
02:35:35,400 --> 02:35:37,800
when we did the bear episode,
the biologist, it was like, yeah,

2590
02:35:37,810 --> 02:35:38,643
to be honest we don't,

2591
02:35:39,040 --> 02:35:42,280
most of my work is just people calling
saying they see panthers and mountain

2592
02:35:42,281 --> 02:35:44,410
wines. They're just turned out
to be house cats. He's like,

2593
02:35:44,411 --> 02:35:47,330
that's the majority of my work
that,

2594
02:35:47,570 --> 02:35:51,580
well they've done that in England where
they've spotted panthers in England and

2595
02:35:51,581 --> 02:35:54,940
they were trying to figure out what it is.
And in most stores,

2596
02:35:55,090 --> 02:35:58,780
most people think that it was actually
just cat's house cats. But you know,

2597
02:35:58,781 --> 02:36:02,770
you get a big fat house cat and it's
dark out and you're shitting your pants

2598
02:36:02,771 --> 02:36:04,900
cause you're alone.
Everything looks bigger.

2599
02:36:05,520 --> 02:36:08,200
I really did think this
fucking score was a wolf.

2600
02:36:08,440 --> 02:36:13,360
Felt like a horse a second or two because
I was eating out of your bird feeder.

2601
02:36:15,040 --> 02:36:19,840
This drink down. I gotta stop.
And with the math, we were, uh,

2602
02:36:19,950 --> 02:36:23,620
in Alberta and we knew that there
was wolves in the area. There's,

2603
02:36:23,650 --> 02:36:26,080
there's a lot of wolves in
near, in fact, they started a,

2604
02:36:26,150 --> 02:36:29,530
they hunt them quite a bit up
there now, um, because they're,

2605
02:36:29,531 --> 02:36:32,200
they're having a lot of problems with
them because they can't figure out what

2606
02:36:32,201 --> 02:36:33,400
the real numbers are there.

2607
02:36:33,401 --> 02:36:38,401
Grizzly problems or even bigger in Alberta
because they don't have a season on

2608
02:36:38,531 --> 02:36:39,040
grizzlies.

2609
02:36:39,040 --> 02:36:42,520
And Grizzlies aren't scared of people at
all because there's no season on them.

2610
02:36:42,521 --> 02:36:45,410
They're not, they just don't give a
fuck. They just come towards people and,

2611
02:36:46,180 --> 02:36:47,013
and they,

2612
02:36:47,150 --> 02:36:50,110
they believe it's going to take like a
couple of tragedies before they open up a

2613
02:36:50,111 --> 02:36:54,380
season on them. Yeah. But he
been to Alberta, I'm sure.
I usually haven't. Yeah,

2614
02:36:54,420 --> 02:36:55,750
I haven't. No, I want to, well,

2615
02:36:55,751 --> 02:37:00,250
it's like any super dense wilderness
where good luck trying to count what the

2616
02:37:00,251 --> 02:37:01,840
fuck's in there.
You have no clue.

2617
02:37:02,410 --> 02:37:06,880
I don't even know how you're doing
your hair traps, your DNA samples.

2618
02:37:06,881 --> 02:37:10,900
But before that, yeah, it's weird.
Even if they do that, I mean,

2619
02:37:10,901 --> 02:37:14,260
how can they have enough
traps that you're looking at?

2620
02:37:14,261 --> 02:37:16,250
I have some video us driving

2621
02:37:16,250 --> 02:37:19,640
to uh, one of the locations
we went to and it's insane.

2622
02:37:19,641 --> 02:37:22,650
Like you were coming over this crest and
everywhere to the left and everywhere

2623
02:37:22,651 --> 02:37:27,620
to the right is just dense forest with
no fucking people anywhere there and a

2624
02:37:27,621 --> 02:37:29,820
shit load of bears and a Shitload,

2625
02:37:29,840 --> 02:37:33,650
a moose and a shitload of elk and they
just don't know. They just don't know.

2626
02:37:34,190 --> 02:37:39,190
The only way they know is by hunters
with camera traps and the catch 22 is the

2627
02:37:39,561 --> 02:37:41,960
hunters don't want to
report the grizzlies.

2628
02:37:41,961 --> 02:37:45,020
Cause if their report the grizzlies and
they shut down the black bear hunting

2629
02:37:45,920 --> 02:37:49,790
because right now grizzlies are
endangered or I should say protected.

2630
02:37:49,791 --> 02:37:52,670
They're not in danger. They see them
every day. They're sitting there,

2631
02:37:52,671 --> 02:37:56,170
literally they're shutting
down. They have, um, um,

2632
02:37:56,600 --> 02:37:58,940
like a lot of people don't
like the idea of baiting.

2633
02:37:59,210 --> 02:38:03,860
They don't like the idea of leaving out
food and Rinella explained like his own

2634
02:38:03,861 --> 02:38:06,590
distaste for it the last time he was here.
I totally get it.

2635
02:38:06,890 --> 02:38:10,880
But if you want to hunt bears in Alberta,
you have two choices.

2636
02:38:11,270 --> 02:38:15,170
You either can't hunt them in the spring
because you'll never find them or you

2637
02:38:15,171 --> 02:38:18,770
hunt them in the fall when they're eating
berries on hills and you'd get fined

2638
02:38:18,771 --> 02:38:20,720
them there. You can spot and
stalk and shoot him there.

2639
02:38:21,020 --> 02:38:23,870
But if you want to shoot him,
other than that, you have to bait.

2640
02:38:24,260 --> 02:38:27,650
And so they bait and they set up these
bait stations and they get these bears

2641
02:38:27,651 --> 02:38:30,350
accustomed to coming in to these
one areas to get food. Well,

2642
02:38:30,351 --> 02:38:32,360
they shutting them down all the time,

2643
02:38:32,361 --> 02:38:37,010
cause grizzlies come in and my friend
John Rivet, who is up there says duty,

2644
02:38:37,040 --> 02:38:40,250
you don't even want to see them
when they come in. He goes,

2645
02:38:40,251 --> 02:38:42,350
because you're looking at
black bears and black bears,

2646
02:38:42,351 --> 02:38:44,000
you know the big ones like 500 pounds.

2647
02:38:44,270 --> 02:38:48,880
And then also in this fucking boss comes
in through the woods and they come in

2648
02:38:48,890 --> 02:38:52,250
totally different. They're not quiet,
they're not trying to sneak around,

2649
02:38:52,730 --> 02:38:57,500
own the place, snap and twigs and common
in like a school bus. And he goes,

2650
02:38:57,501 --> 02:39:01,460
and then when you see them, you're like,
what the fuck? They're just so big.

2651
02:39:02,300 --> 02:39:07,300
Just a big monster brown bear that just
scares everything away and you got to

2652
02:39:07,580 --> 02:39:09,140
shut the bait down and get out of there.

2653
02:39:09,590 --> 02:39:12,800
So they shut the baits
down and then some of them,

2654
02:39:12,920 --> 02:39:15,920
they'll take carcasses from
the black bears. You know,

2655
02:39:15,921 --> 02:39:17,900
after they take the meat off of it,

2656
02:39:17,901 --> 02:39:20,660
they take what's left and they'll throw
them in the areas where the grizzlies

2657
02:39:20,661 --> 02:39:23,480
are just to try to
maintain them in that area.

2658
02:39:23,850 --> 02:39:28,460
Try to habituate them to that one area.
But even that, good luck, he's like,

2659
02:39:28,461 --> 02:39:30,860
there's a lot of them. They
didn't, didn't really don't know.

2660
02:39:30,890 --> 02:39:31,723
They don't know how many.

2661
02:39:31,790 --> 02:39:35,420
So there was a study recently that came
out that I tweeted that was showing how

2662
02:39:35,421 --> 02:39:39,140
ma there, there's way more grizzlies
up there than they thought ever.

2663
02:39:39,550 --> 02:39:42,970
Yeah, that's the grizzlies are one of
those things where they're kind of,

2664
02:39:43,600 --> 02:39:48,330
their overall range has diminished, but
the places they are, they're over poppy.

2665
02:39:48,430 --> 02:39:52,510
I would maybe not go as
far as overpopulation, but
they're getting there. Yeah,

2666
02:39:52,840 --> 02:39:56,260
they're pretty brazen. Like, I've
got a lot, I know a lot of people,

2667
02:39:56,261 --> 02:40:00,160
they used to hunt certain areas and
they say the grizzlies had gotten so bad

2668
02:40:00,161 --> 02:40:01,510
that they just don't want them anymore.

2669
02:40:01,720 --> 02:40:04,560
And a lot of that I just take with a
grain of salt because I think some people

2670
02:40:04,600 --> 02:40:08,440
just get overly spooked
about things like that. Um,

2671
02:40:08,650 --> 02:40:12,670
but these are people that I trust and
believe that they know what they're doing

2672
02:40:12,671 --> 02:40:14,040
there.
Well there's also that

2673
02:40:14,040 --> 02:40:18,960
weird thing that happens when grizzlies
get used to being around people and when

2674
02:40:18,961 --> 02:40:22,170
people are shooting elk or deer and they
hear a gunshot and they think it's a

2675
02:40:22,171 --> 02:40:24,900
dinner bell, when they come running
towards where the gunshot was,

2676
02:40:24,901 --> 02:40:28,440
cause they know there's going to be a
gut pile that gets spooky because bears

2677
02:40:28,441 --> 02:40:30,450
are really habitual.
Like that's why they have to,

2678
02:40:30,660 --> 02:40:33,120
they have to capture them or kill
them when they catch a meeting,

2679
02:40:33,121 --> 02:40:36,210
people's garbage. Because once they
find garbage, like that's their spot.

2680
02:40:36,650 --> 02:40:37,820
You're just going to keep coming back.

2681
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:39,200
I was doing this,
uh,

2682
02:40:39,230 --> 02:40:44,230
this film project thing in Alaska and
I tracked down this guy that killed the

2683
02:40:46,250 --> 02:40:50,780
Kodiak bear with a knife.
Buck knife. What? Yeah,

2684
02:40:50,810 --> 02:40:54,830
it was crazy story old older guy too.
His name was Jeanne Moe.

2685
02:40:55,040 --> 02:40:58,010
There's been a ton of articles are
written about it and like outdoor life.

2686
02:40:58,011 --> 02:41:00,830
And if this was back,
it wasn't that long ago,

2687
02:41:00,831 --> 02:41:03,790
but I can't really put the
knife in a musket and show.

2688
02:41:03,791 --> 02:41:08,060
So I mean you're like these bear stories
and us just like I'm to tracking down

2689
02:41:08,061 --> 02:41:11,920
some of these barriers in this is
dark and so he's on Kodiak island.

2690
02:41:11,930 --> 02:41:14,810
Kodiak Brown bears are the biggest
barriers in the world, but they don't,

2691
02:41:15,470 --> 02:41:19,280
there's not that many attacks surprisingly
for the size of the bear and the many

2692
02:41:19,281 --> 02:41:21,260
there are. But there's probably
also, there's also not,

2693
02:41:21,770 --> 02:41:24,380
Kodiak island isn't like Yellowstone park.

2694
02:41:24,381 --> 02:41:26,690
I mean you didn't have that
many people there are really.

2695
02:41:27,050 --> 02:41:31,490
So he's getting out of deer turns
around the Baird's just on him.

2696
02:41:32,210 --> 02:41:35,750
All he has is the knife.
So he's like trying to fight it off,

2697
02:41:35,751 --> 02:41:40,751
stabbing the thing and the bear like
territory toward piece out of his arm,

2698
02:41:40,821 --> 02:41:43,280
out of his leg, picks him
up, the shaking him around.

2699
02:41:43,700 --> 02:41:47,510
Then the bear goes off and at one point
he's just like, thought he was done.

2700
02:41:47,511 --> 02:41:48,890
He was like yelling at the bear.

2701
02:41:49,130 --> 02:41:53,990
Bear comes back mauls him another time
he stabbing and fighting it off and then

2702
02:41:53,991 --> 02:41:56,810
I guess he stabbed it enough times.

2703
02:41:56,870 --> 02:42:00,410
He kept like trying to feed his arm
while he just like he said he was out of

2704
02:42:00,411 --> 02:42:04,520
strength. I think the bear when
officer like laid down is bleeding out.

2705
02:42:05,060 --> 02:42:08,300
He might have crawled to his
rifle at that point. I think he,

2706
02:42:08,720 --> 02:42:10,580
I can't remember if the
bear was dead or not,

2707
02:42:10,581 --> 02:42:13,970
but he shot at after the bear was
just like laying there and then hikes,

2708
02:42:14,030 --> 02:42:17,030
you know, free four miles back
to the beach and he's like,

2709
02:42:17,810 --> 02:42:20,810
I can't remember how old he was.
He had 60 something like that.

2710
02:42:20,811 --> 02:42:24,920
I remember this story. Yeah,
he was a, and then he says,

2711
02:42:25,130 --> 02:42:28,580
so then his son, they meet his
son, they take them to this.

2712
02:42:28,581 --> 02:42:32,690
There's one cabin there where
there's year round residents and uh,

2713
02:42:32,990 --> 02:42:36,680
it was actually on I think raspberry
island there and they bring him into this

2714
02:42:36,681 --> 02:42:41,120
cabin. There's a German couple that
lives there. And like he said, they,

2715
02:42:41,390 --> 02:42:44,960
they brought him in the cabin and for some
reason, I cannot remember exactly why,

2716
02:42:44,961 --> 02:42:49,220
but the dude that owned the cabin ended
up taking a chainsaw and cutting out the

2717
02:42:49,221 --> 02:42:52,120
wall so the rescuers could
come in and get a stretcher in,

2718
02:42:52,121 --> 02:42:55,670
like stabilize him cause he's just
dying on the table and they take him to

2719
02:42:55,671 --> 02:42:59,150
Kodiak hospital, do all the surgeries,
skin grafts, everything saved.

2720
02:42:59,151 --> 02:43:00,710
His life ended up getting,

2721
02:43:00,711 --> 02:43:04,630
keeping like you end up buying the
bare back at an auction and uh,

2722
02:43:04,880 --> 02:43:08,840
they may like a rug thing. So, so
I give him the bear. No, because,

2723
02:43:08,841 --> 02:43:13,000
well in Alaska,
if you kill a without the proper tag,

2724
02:43:13,300 --> 02:43:16,960
it's your responsibility to skin
it out and like bring it in. So,

2725
02:43:17,080 --> 02:43:20,590
so son went back while he's in the
hospital because you have to do it.

2726
02:43:20,591 --> 02:43:24,730
So his son went back, skin the bear out,
turned it over to the Alaska Department.

2727
02:43:25,290 --> 02:43:29,790
Um, and then, then they like auction
that stuff off or whatever. That's rude.

2728
02:43:30,450 --> 02:43:34,810
But he ended up with the bear and so it
was kind of cool to see like you saw the

2729
02:43:34,811 --> 02:43:38,230
bear and he saw the buck knife and
there's still like the bear's hair in the

2730
02:43:38,231 --> 02:43:42,250
buck knife now he's got it right
next to it on the wall. This guy,

2731
02:43:42,430 --> 02:43:44,050
it was a cool experience.
It was cool. It was,

2732
02:43:44,051 --> 02:43:46,360
it was a cool experience
hearing the story firsthand.

2733
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:50,740
It was a pretty intense
stories. He was telling it.
Yeah. I just want only imagine.

2734
02:43:50,800 --> 02:43:55,050
It was cool. That's crazy. And then
a cooler if we didn't shoot it. Yeah.

2735
02:43:55,051 --> 02:43:58,140
That's buck knife to yeah.
And that's what I think. Uh,

2736
02:43:58,510 --> 02:44:02,170
but I mean he did fend it off with
the knife. Yeah, I guess. Well,

2737
02:44:02,171 --> 02:44:03,580
it's amazing that didn't get his head.

2738
02:44:05,090 --> 02:44:08,560
He must have been really smart with
his arms and his legs to kicking in.

2739
02:44:09,250 --> 02:44:12,950
Oh. If she can Christ God, this is when,

2740
02:44:13,390 --> 02:44:15,660
when you see the head,
like a,

2741
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:20,320
I've only seen a grizzly bear
had a few times, but when you a,

2742
02:44:20,321 --> 02:44:21,720
I've never seen one of them in the,

2743
02:44:21,770 --> 02:44:25,600
in the wild separate when I was a
kid once I saw one in Yellowstone,

2744
02:44:26,200 --> 02:44:29,170
but they would come up to
people's car doors back then.

2745
02:44:29,171 --> 02:44:33,420
People would feed them at Yellowstone
from cars. They still like, Oh yeah,

2746
02:44:33,880 --> 02:44:35,800
remember that? Yeah, here's the scene.

2747
02:44:36,520 --> 02:44:40,420
They would feed them and they will allow
that for some strange reason. But uh,

2748
02:44:40,480 --> 02:44:45,450
I've seen skulls before and when you see
a skull and it's this wide, it's crazy.

2749
02:44:45,460 --> 02:44:47,590
Now when you think
about that and it's the,

2750
02:44:47,830 --> 02:44:52,830
the mass of the thing when you're just
a giant eating machine and an enormous

2751
02:44:54,401 --> 02:44:57,660
crushing eating machine.
Oh yeah.

2752
02:44:58,090 --> 02:45:01,930
The thing that I always remember when I
think about a grizzly bears is there's

2753
02:45:01,931 --> 02:45:06,931
this video of a bear chasing a moose and
a chases the moose down tackles it and

2754
02:45:09,340 --> 02:45:13,000
just starts eating it gut first.
And this moves is trying to get away.

2755
02:45:13,001 --> 02:45:16,630
And this is grizzlies.
Just eating its guts just decides,

2756
02:45:16,631 --> 02:45:20,650
just hold it down and start eating, you
know, that doesn't even bother telling it.

2757
02:45:20,651 --> 02:45:21,460
And it's like,
I got you.

2758
02:45:21,460 --> 02:45:25,000
Yeah. Your mind. Well, the grizzly does
it. Hey, the grizzlies not sad for it.

2759
02:45:25,001 --> 02:45:27,800
And he's like, he's
stoked. Yeah, he's fine.

2760
02:45:28,290 --> 02:45:33,010
He has pumped, but it's just the
brutality of what he's doing. You know,

2761
02:45:33,210 --> 02:45:36,780
the holding this thing down, you've
seen that video where the, uh, the,

2762
02:45:36,810 --> 02:45:40,200
the grizzly is killing a
deer in this guy's yard.

2763
02:45:40,710 --> 02:45:44,460
The deer screaming. I want it. Can you
play it? Yeah. Pull it, pull it up. Jamie.

2764
02:45:45,980 --> 02:45:49,730
Um, deer in backyard, uh,

2765
02:45:49,890 --> 02:45:53,040
and it's a brown brown bears
got him and screaming just

2766
02:45:55,290 --> 02:45:56,950
bears on its back and just,

2767
02:45:57,250 --> 02:46:00,990
just fucking mall and it in this guy's
yard and the guys looking out the back

2768
02:46:00,991 --> 02:46:02,310
window like, oh, fuck

2769
02:46:02,440 --> 02:46:07,110
the bear's thinking, why'd
you put a yard? Yeah, exactly.

2770
02:46:07,280 --> 02:46:09,980
What this is it, right? Yeah.

2771
02:46:12,860 --> 02:46:13,693
Hmm.

2772
02:46:14,400 --> 02:46:15,570
Wow.
That's intense.

2773
02:46:15,940 --> 02:46:16,773
Yeah.

2774
02:46:19,330 --> 02:46:23,620
And the people that are just listening
to this, the bears on top of it,

2775
02:46:23,950 --> 02:46:27,250
just jack and it's back and
it's neck and it's screaming.

2776
02:46:28,030 --> 02:46:31,720
And the kids are standing right there.
So many standing right there.

2777
02:46:33,720 --> 02:46:38,090
Oh my God.
Mule deer.

2778
02:46:39,270 --> 02:46:40,103
Yeah.

2779
02:46:40,380 --> 02:46:44,070
It's pretty big deer too. Yeah,
and then not a big bear. No.

2780
02:46:45,320 --> 02:46:48,840
Mary's, it'd be a color phase,
right? Yeah, it is. It's
a, it's a black bear then.

2781
02:46:48,870 --> 02:46:53,040
It's a blackberry at blackberry. Not all
black bears are black. Yeah. Color phase.

2782
02:46:53,041 --> 02:46:58,020
Black bear for po. People listen and they
can get like blonde, even blonde red.

2783
02:46:58,080 --> 02:47:01,380
Oh my God. It's that bear
attacking that chick. Oh, is that?

2784
02:47:01,381 --> 02:47:05,430
That's a dummy that was in the zoo.
That's a lady that climbed over the fence.

2785
02:47:05,860 --> 02:47:09,810
The pick your berries or friends. Don't
make me watch this. Shut this off.

2786
02:47:10,060 --> 02:47:12,180
Can I just can't.
I can't.

2787
02:47:12,570 --> 02:47:17,570
Have you ever been in a situation where
you felt like vulnerable to a animals?

2788
02:47:17,800 --> 02:47:19,720
No. No I haven't. I mean

2789
02:47:22,510 --> 02:47:27,280
I've seen animals be semi
aggressive, but no, nothing.

2790
02:47:27,281 --> 02:47:30,070
That's a real serious.

2791
02:47:30,430 --> 02:47:33,560
Have you been in areas that have
large wolf populations have? Yeah,

2792
02:47:33,710 --> 02:47:35,790
like reintroduced wolves.
Yeah.

2793
02:47:36,850 --> 02:47:40,360
Have you noticed a difference between
when they were before how they are now?

2794
02:47:40,420 --> 02:47:40,871
Yeah.

2795
02:47:40,871 --> 02:47:43,690
Well now things are changing because
there's a season for him and everything,

2796
02:47:43,691 --> 02:47:44,830
like their manage now

2797
02:47:45,070 --> 02:47:47,350
and their own places, right?
Yeah. Not In Wyoming, right?

2798
02:47:47,351 --> 02:47:48,990
Well it still doesn't have a civil war.

2799
02:47:49,330 --> 02:47:53,500
I do think, and maybe it's not
anymore what they did for awhile. Um,

2800
02:47:54,070 --> 02:47:57,970
I don't know what they keep changing
it back and forth. But uh, yeah,

2801
02:47:57,971 --> 02:48:02,971
I mean there's definitely in one of the
areas that I grew up hunting and guiding

2802
02:48:04,511 --> 02:48:07,810
and all that stuff, you have the wolf,
the wolf population exploded in there,

2803
02:48:07,811 --> 02:48:12,811
but also the elk population exploded
after fire because there's a huge dynamic

2804
02:48:13,001 --> 02:48:17,410
between forest fires and elk
because this new growth, new growth,

2805
02:48:17,411 --> 02:48:18,430
they need that new growth.

2806
02:48:18,431 --> 02:48:21,850
So one of the things like one of
the things that really hinders,

2807
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:22,691
and that's another thing,

2808
02:48:22,691 --> 02:48:25,330
it comes back to like humans
regulating too much is we stopped,

2809
02:48:25,331 --> 02:48:30,331
we like do fire prevention and try to
prevent forest fires when huge forest

2810
02:48:31,481 --> 02:48:35,290
fires increase populations.
So there's a huge ebb and flow.

2811
02:48:35,291 --> 02:48:37,930
And when we hinder that
and try not to have fires,

2812
02:48:38,380 --> 02:48:42,250
animal populations decline actually.
So that's a huge thing too.

2813
02:48:42,280 --> 02:48:43,330
That's a whole nother topic.

2814
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:44,241
Well,

2815
02:48:44,241 --> 02:48:49,241
it's the micromanaging of some incredibly
complex systems that we don't totally

2816
02:48:50,061 --> 02:48:54,940
understand like forest fires or like
predators, like we've tried to, you know,

2817
02:48:55,370 --> 02:48:59,870
keep predators away from certain types of
prey to allow these animals to survive.

2818
02:48:59,871 --> 02:49:00,840
And the way,

2819
02:49:00,890 --> 02:49:05,030
the weird thing about it is when you
really look at the overall population of

2820
02:49:05,031 --> 02:49:08,220
animals on this planet,
the that have ever existed,

2821
02:49:08,490 --> 02:49:12,660
90 something percent of everything
that's ever existed as extinct. Yeah.

2822
02:49:13,150 --> 02:49:16,510
And it can teach. It probably will
continue to be that way, I would imagine.

2823
02:49:16,511 --> 02:49:18,270
Unless we keep fucking with it.
Certain animals,

2824
02:49:18,750 --> 02:49:22,830
there's some animals that will probably
just go extinct and yeah, maybe.

2825
02:49:22,920 --> 02:49:26,340
Maybe humans had a huge part to do
with it and maybe others, you know,

2826
02:49:26,550 --> 02:49:29,670
I don't know. If we did, maybe they
would have gone extinct anyways.

2827
02:49:30,090 --> 02:49:34,380
I feel like the rhinos
probably on the brink now. It's
pretty close. Yeah, there's,

2828
02:49:34,860 --> 02:49:39,420
yeah. Sad. It's too bad. It's such a cool
animal. And there's soap prehistoric.

2829
02:49:39,421 --> 02:49:41,940
Apparently they move incredibly fast.
Yeah.

2830
02:49:42,210 --> 02:49:45,900
Like that's such a wild animal.
And you look at it like that.

2831
02:49:45,901 --> 02:49:48,960
Might as well be a stegosaurus.
Like what is the difference between that,

2832
02:49:49,260 --> 02:49:53,790
you know, had a triceratops, not
much. Not much. Yeah. I mean some,

2833
02:49:53,791 --> 02:49:56,520
some different variations in
the horns. They try. Yeah.

2834
02:49:56,521 --> 02:50:00,430
Triceratops was a cold blooded
animal. Right. But were
some of the dinosaurs? Boy,

2835
02:50:00,450 --> 02:50:04,830
I want to say a few of them were warm
blooded. Like some of the beings,

2836
02:50:04,920 --> 02:50:08,710
enormous creatures that lived during
that time were warm blooded was,

2837
02:50:09,150 --> 02:50:12,490
I think that's a more recent debate.
Yeah.

2838
02:50:12,500 --> 02:50:16,740
But on the wolves, yeah, they've
definitely been reintroduced areas,

2839
02:50:16,741 --> 02:50:21,741
affected populations and then the
wolf populations then explode up.

2840
02:50:22,201 --> 02:50:25,080
Populations explode,
wolf population explodes.

2841
02:50:25,440 --> 02:50:30,300
Elk population drops with
populations remains large.

2842
02:50:30,780 --> 02:50:32,130
And you would,
you would almost think,

2843
02:50:32,131 --> 02:50:37,131
well over time the wolves
would start to die off,

2844
02:50:37,680 --> 02:50:40,530
but they can also just
become more nomadic,

2845
02:50:41,130 --> 02:50:45,930
kill off an area and then just move on.
Yeah. You know, they're fucking smart too.

2846
02:50:46,010 --> 02:50:50,700
Yeah. You did that wolf episode. That
was really cool. Cause you know the, the,

2847
02:50:50,940 --> 02:50:54,800
when you mimic the tactics
that they use of a,

2848
02:50:54,801 --> 02:50:58,180
of chasing animals into like traps.
Yep.

2849
02:50:58,350 --> 02:51:02,220
They set traps for elk.
Yeah. They would. Well,

2850
02:51:02,221 --> 02:51:04,620
wolf hunts animals by chasing.

2851
02:51:05,100 --> 02:51:07,950
So if it an l stands its ground,

2852
02:51:08,010 --> 02:51:12,530
the wolves generally won't go in and
kill it because they stand the risk of

2853
02:51:12,930 --> 02:51:13,763
being injured.

2854
02:51:14,700 --> 02:51:19,050
So they incite it to run and as they get
it on the run then they can get it from

2855
02:51:19,051 --> 02:51:23,940
the back end, slow it down and
kill it. And that's, that's
how they hunt. And Yeah.

2856
02:51:23,941 --> 02:51:27,270
So that was in that episode meeting.
My brother tried to do the same thing,

2857
02:51:27,510 --> 02:51:28,343
run the elk,

2858
02:51:29,270 --> 02:51:33,210
catch up and cut them off
and hunt like the wolf.

2859
02:51:33,690 --> 02:51:35,730
I mean they have a lot of,

2860
02:51:35,820 --> 02:51:40,560
well they've got a lot better stamina
than us and there are just far superior at

2861
02:51:40,561 --> 02:51:44,010
doing it. But humans are pretty
good at doing it as well,

2862
02:51:44,011 --> 02:51:47,100
which is pretty impressive. Well
that's a big thing in Africa, right?

2863
02:51:47,150 --> 02:51:48,870
They can do their assistance
assistance all. Yeah.

2864
02:51:49,250 --> 02:51:52,140
And the other thing about elk is how
quick they can move up the side of a

2865
02:51:52,141 --> 02:51:55,800
mountain. Yeah. But they tire out
fast today. Yeah. If you chase that,

2866
02:51:55,950 --> 02:51:59,520
you'll see their tongues are hanging
out there. Big, large animal. Like,

2867
02:51:59,521 --> 02:52:03,120
even you think of a horse and if you,
if you push a horse up a mountain,

2868
02:52:03,270 --> 02:52:06,580
you can walk up a mountain faster than
a horse over a long period of time.

2869
02:52:06,610 --> 02:52:10,790
Really? Yeah. Especially in the heat. They
just start to overheat. Whereas we sweat,

2870
02:52:10,850 --> 02:52:12,520
we carry water and they're just like,

2871
02:52:13,450 --> 02:52:17,470
I would've never imagined that because
when I see people packing out with horses,

2872
02:52:17,471 --> 02:52:19,240
I'd be like, well that's because
the horse don't get tired.

2873
02:52:19,640 --> 02:52:24,430
They do get tired and they, I mean,
they sweat still the sweat, but um,

2874
02:52:24,880 --> 02:52:26,950
they uh, yeah, they,

2875
02:52:28,510 --> 02:52:32,440
well a horse can carry a lot more weight
than us and it's not on your back.

2876
02:52:33,040 --> 02:52:36,760
The horse isn't complaining that state.
Yeah, exactly. Yeah. This is fun.

2877
02:52:36,761 --> 02:52:40,310
I like fucking tired, man. I just don't
know how to say cut the shit. Yeah.

2878
02:52:41,410 --> 02:52:46,280
He's like, he just tries. Next time you go
to round them up to pack, he's like, man,

2879
02:52:46,480 --> 02:52:50,210
he's a little hard to get to the corral.
Do they, do they get sore too? They must.

2880
02:52:50,250 --> 02:52:54,070
Oh yeah. They get sore and they sweat and
you just don't push him either. Right.

2881
02:52:54,071 --> 02:52:57,800
Like he take it slow and walk and yeah,

2882
02:52:58,600 --> 02:53:00,040
we're about out of time.

2883
02:53:00,070 --> 02:53:03,090
Is there anything else you want
to add or let people know? A,

2884
02:53:03,100 --> 02:53:05,440
there's another way to
get your show right.

2885
02:53:05,470 --> 02:53:09,610
It's not just a watch it on television
and if they have that Verizon fios

2886
02:53:09,611 --> 02:53:14,490
problem, if you've got the horizon fire
problem or you want maybe saw an episode,

2887
02:53:14,500 --> 02:53:18,760
missed an episode, you want it, I
know where you can get it and do it.

2888
02:53:19,450 --> 02:53:23,680
Yeah, it's a Apex
predator.tv. Okay. Pittsburgh.

2889
02:53:23,770 --> 02:53:28,480
And so you can download it. You can
buy the season or just single episodes.

2890
02:53:29,020 --> 02:53:34,020
And last time I was on your podcast there
I had a promo code and forgot to give

2891
02:53:34,871 --> 02:53:39,871
it out and there were seven people who
were in genius enough to type in Rogan

2892
02:53:41,260 --> 02:53:44,730
and they got a huge deal. So there
are seven get it out. Yeah, there,

2893
02:53:44,780 --> 02:53:46,810
there are just people that listen to your,
there's seven of them.

2894
02:53:47,200 --> 02:53:50,980
They'll listen to your podcast and when
they go to buy stuff they type in your

2895
02:53:50,981 --> 02:53:54,950
name and it gets some sweet deals.
So your name, you just type in Rogan.

2896
02:53:55,420 --> 02:53:58,150
There is a, there's like a
promo code. Oh, that's cool.

2897
02:53:58,151 --> 02:54:01,000
Because we use that code for
so many different sponsors.

2898
02:54:01,030 --> 02:54:05,980
So you can use Rogan or jre. Oh,
beautiful. And I would need to,

2899
02:54:06,310 --> 02:54:11,110
I think it's like, it's a, it's a sweet
discount. That's a cool a website too.

2900
02:54:11,111 --> 02:54:15,070
Who did your website? Uh, we ate Zpz
Dana, what the fuck they're doing?
