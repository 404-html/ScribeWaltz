1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,530
The joe rogan experience,

2
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:02,101
you've,

3
00:00:02,101 --> 00:00:02,850
um,

4
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:04,170
you've kicked the green bitch.

5
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:06,180
Yes,

6
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:06,961
yes.

7
00:00:06,961 --> 00:00:11,490
After a 24 year intense
relationship with the,

8
00:00:11,491 --> 00:00:12,060
uh,

9
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,610
the green goddess or the Green Bitch,

10
00:00:14,611 --> 00:00:16,140
depending on what mood she's in,

11
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,730
I had to stop.

12
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,480
Um,

13
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,313
and uh,

14
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:21,210
I've come in for some,

15
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,470
I've convinced for some,

16
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:27,530
for some criticism for their son and
I feel it's important to say that,

17
00:00:29,401 --> 00:00:29,770
uh,

18
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:33,390
I hugely value and a love cannabis.

19
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,350
I think it's a wonderful
herbal ally and I think that,

20
00:00:37,351 --> 00:00:41,130
I don't think that I would ever have
written my books off historical mystery if

21
00:00:41,131 --> 00:00:44,670
I had not encountered
cannabis rather late in life.

22
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:45,900
I did not smoke,

23
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,140
uh,

24
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:51,140
Eddie Dope until I was 37 years old and
I'm now 62 wire and roughly rad about

25
00:00:52,381 --> 00:00:53,370
the age of 38.

26
00:00:53,371 --> 00:00:56,880
That's when I started getting into
historical mysteries for that.

27
00:00:56,881 --> 00:00:57,420
It was all,

28
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:57,811
of course,

29
00:00:57,811 --> 00:00:59,040
it's total stoner style.

30
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:00,443
Absolutely.

31
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,040
Before that it was all carried.

32
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:02,671
The fairs,

33
00:01:02,671 --> 00:01:03,470
you know,

34
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:03,780
so,

35
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,150
but suddenly something opened
up for me and I'm very,

36
00:01:06,151 --> 00:01:08,190
and I'm very grateful
to the herb for that.

37
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:11,530
And initially my eye,

38
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,271
again,

39
00:01:12,271 --> 00:01:13,260
I need to emphasize this.

40
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,560
I think the problem I eventually
ended up having with cannabis,

41
00:01:16,561 --> 00:01:17,760
it's not the fault of cannabis,

42
00:01:17,761 --> 00:01:19,710
it's the fault of Graham Hancock.

43
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:22,900
I think my relationship
became abusive with the herb.

44
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,150
It was not initially.

45
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,720
Initially it was something I
would do evenings and weekends.

46
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:31,050
I would not try to write
while I was actually stoned.

47
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:35,850
I would do my days work and then chill
out in the evening with a pipe or a

48
00:01:35,851 --> 00:01:36,300
joint.

49
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:36,780
That was,

50
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,980
that was how it was for
me for quite awhile.

51
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,120
And I went through my first
big historical mystery book,

52
00:01:42,121 --> 00:01:43,290
the sign and the seal,

53
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:43,920
uh,

54
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,800
which was published in
1992 with that pattern.

55
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:47,401
In other words,

56
00:01:47,401 --> 00:01:48,270
that I would be,

57
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:52,800
I would be smoking only after I down
tools at the end of the evening and I was

58
00:01:52,801 --> 00:01:53,700
ready to chill.

59
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:54,630
Um,

60
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:55,740
and that worked fine.

61
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:57,210
But then when I started,

62
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,930
when I started writing
fingerprints of the gods,

63
00:02:00,931 --> 00:02:02,150
which was the biggest book I've,

64
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,300
I've ever done,

65
00:02:03,301 --> 00:02:05,520
a 5 million copy bestseller
all around the world,

66
00:02:05,521 --> 00:02:06,540
when I started writing that,

67
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:06,901
I thought,

68
00:02:06,901 --> 00:02:07,980
I'll experiment.

69
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,300
Let's see if I can be stoned and right.

70
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,820
And I discovered that I could,

71
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:15,893
I couldn't be stolen.

72
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,733
Right.

73
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:21,570
And I like being stuck
so much that in a way it,

74
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,850
it urged me to just write all the time,

75
00:02:23,851 --> 00:02:24,150
you know,

76
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,110
because then I had this,

77
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:29,140
I had this incredibly good reason
to be stoned all the time and,

78
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,180
and um,

79
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:33,840
it took away all the physical boredom
of sitting there in my chair in front of

80
00:02:33,841 --> 00:02:35,580
my computer screen,

81
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,640
just everything went away and I went into,

82
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:42,650
drifted into this space where I could
explore ideas and manifest those ideas

83
00:02:43,081 --> 00:02:43,470
down,

84
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:44,400
down on the page.

85
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,660
And I literally,

86
00:02:45,661 --> 00:02:50,580
that's when I began what was to become
ultimately an abusive relationship with

87
00:02:50,581 --> 00:02:51,031
cannabis,

88
00:02:51,031 --> 00:02:53,400
which that I would fire up in those days,

89
00:02:53,401 --> 00:02:57,810
might my joint or my pipe at
a nine or 10 in the morning.

90
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,003
And I would,

91
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:00,250
I'm a hard worker.

92
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,950
I work 16 hours a day very
often when I'm writing.

93
00:03:02,951 --> 00:03:04,510
So come two o'clock the next morning,

94
00:03:04,511 --> 00:03:06,610
I'd still be there smoking away.

95
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,033
Um,

96
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,940
and as the years went by,

97
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:13,900
this became a permanent
daily pattern for me.

98
00:03:13,901 --> 00:03:15,400
Whether I was writing or not,

99
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:19,900
I would be stoned from the moment I
got up until the moment I went to bed.

100
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,660
And most people who came by my
house or talk to me on the phone,

101
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:25,210
they would have had absolutely
no idea because I was,

102
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,920
I was completely in control.

103
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,170
I didn't seem hi,

104
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,360
I could hold a rational conversation.

105
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:32,051
I was,

106
00:03:32,051 --> 00:03:32,980
I was just fine.

107
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:33,521
Um,

108
00:03:33,521 --> 00:03:34,300
and I've just felt,

109
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,380
I just felt really good.

110
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:36,130
Uh,

111
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:37,900
and this is how it went on for many years.

112
00:03:37,901 --> 00:03:37,991
Uh,

113
00:03:37,991 --> 00:03:42,280
later on about in the early to that
Renova 2005 actually I think perhaps a

114
00:03:42,281 --> 00:03:43,114
little earlier,

115
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,410
one of my kids told me that,

116
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:44,681
you know,

117
00:03:44,681 --> 00:03:45,161
this stuff,

118
00:03:45,161 --> 00:03:46,090
this smoke is,

119
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:48,190
you don't need to have
combustion products.

120
00:03:48,191 --> 00:03:49,660
Why don't you use a vaporizer?

121
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:55,140
So I bought myself a volcano
and on the Internet and,

122
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:56,703
and um,

123
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:00,760
and then I heard that the
British government was going
to ban the use of ban all

124
00:04:00,761 --> 00:04:01,594
peripherals.

125
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,490
So I bought myself two more volcanoes.

126
00:04:03,491 --> 00:04:04,570
Volcanoes are quite expensive,

127
00:04:04,571 --> 00:04:08,470
but that shows how dedicated I was to
make sure that you're covering your bases.

128
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,350
I had to make sure that
I covered my bases.

129
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:10,750
Um,

130
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,530
and then I would be vaporizing from nine
in the morning until two o'clock the

131
00:04:14,531 --> 00:04:15,101
next morning,

132
00:04:15,101 --> 00:04:15,980
seven days a weekend,

133
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,770
and increasingly strong strains.

134
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:20,920
And this is one thing that I would say
if we lived in a regime and irrational

135
00:04:20,921 --> 00:04:25,480
regime where there was no attempt by
the government to police our states of

136
00:04:25,481 --> 00:04:26,314
consciousness,

137
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:29,680
we could have much more choice in
the kind of cannabis we get hold of.

138
00:04:29,681 --> 00:04:30,191
For example,

139
00:04:30,191 --> 00:04:34,900
I would have liked to have canvas
with much more CBD and maybe less THC.

140
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:38,350
But the varieties I
were smoking were very,

141
00:04:38,351 --> 00:04:39,280
very THC,

142
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,300
THC,

143
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:40,810
uh,

144
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:42,970
loaded as the difference in effect.

145
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:43,451
Well,

146
00:04:43,451 --> 00:04:43,841
okay.

147
00:04:43,841 --> 00:04:44,674
I mean the,

148
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,780
it depends how much you buy
into the research on this,

149
00:04:46,781 --> 00:04:47,110
but,

150
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:48,730
but the law,

151
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,440
a lot of good science has been done.

152
00:04:50,441 --> 00:04:55,441
And the suggestion is that
THC can promote or reveal.

153
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,100
I don't want to,

154
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,230
I don't want to blame the herb.

155
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,490
Anything I,

156
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,550
it can reveal certain psychotic
tendencies in oneself.

157
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:06,400
And this is the well known paranoia,

158
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:06,940
which,

159
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,080
which many people associate with,

160
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,150
with smoking cannabis.

161
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,200
The CBD is an antipsychotic agent.

162
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:17,410
So the natural herb is
balanced with CBD and THC and,

163
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,450
and it looks after you very well,

164
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,910
but where we go into intensive
breeding of the herb,

165
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,310
focusing on the element
that makes you really high,

166
00:05:24,311 --> 00:05:25,540
which is the Thc,

167
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,800
then we get,

168
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,130
uh,

169
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:31,090
get a herb that is somewhat unbalanced
as a result of the interference of,

170
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:31,281
uh,

171
00:05:31,281 --> 00:05:31,501
of,

172
00:05:31,501 --> 00:05:32,334
of humanity and,

173
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:32,920
and,

174
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,250
and,

175
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,810
but you get more bang for your buck.

176
00:05:34,811 --> 00:05:35,081
You know,

177
00:05:35,081 --> 00:05:35,914
that's a very,

178
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,360
that's a very strong herb.

179
00:05:37,361 --> 00:05:41,560
And I began to like a particular
variety called cheese,

180
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:46,450
I think it's called cheese because
it smells like old socks or,

181
00:05:46,451 --> 00:05:46,871
or,

182
00:05:46,871 --> 00:05:47,530
um,

183
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:49,390
Stilton in like a blue cheese.

184
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,760
And a,

185
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:53,880
I found a grower who
lived local to me who,

186
00:05:53,881 --> 00:05:56,250
who was just heading
amazing green fingers and,

187
00:05:56,251 --> 00:05:57,084
and I would,

188
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:59,600
I would buy from him and um,

189
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,920
and I would sometimes have,

190
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:01,191
you know,

191
00:06:01,191 --> 00:06:04,370
five or six ounces of the herb in my
house cause I was blazing through this

192
00:06:04,371 --> 00:06:06,860
stuff at the vendors at a tremendous rate.

193
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:10,240
That's enough to you where you
could get in trouble for that.

194
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:13,400
So that's where the paranoia
starts to become legitimate,

195
00:06:13,401 --> 00:06:13,791
you know,

196
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:15,260
because actually they can numb,

197
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:18,830
they can break down your door and they
can confiscate your home and take away

198
00:06:18,831 --> 00:06:20,540
your liberty and fuck you up forever.

199
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:21,081
You know,

200
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:21,950
they can do that.

201
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,161
And,

202
00:06:22,161 --> 00:06:25,220
and so every time I had a
ring at the door or you know,

203
00:06:25,221 --> 00:06:26,570
a car came up the street,

204
00:06:26,571 --> 00:06:27,220
I would,

205
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:27,860
I would,

206
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:28,160
you know,

207
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,371
get,

208
00:06:28,371 --> 00:06:28,661
get,

209
00:06:28,661 --> 00:06:30,080
get paranoid and get paranoid.

210
00:06:30,081 --> 00:06:33,020
And you were high and I
was high and I was high.

211
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:34,820
You get paranoid when you were a high,

212
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:35,720
well,

213
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,580
this is one of the reasons why,

214
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,960
look what happened to me
was that run about 2003,

215
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:48,470
I started for reasons
of research initially,

216
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:49,130
uh,

217
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:51,020
working with Iowasca,

218
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,880
the vine of souls.

219
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:55,640
This is the powerful psychedelic brew,

220
00:06:55,940 --> 00:07:00,940
which has been consumed by shamanistic
cultures in the Amazon for thousands and

221
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:01,670
thousands of years.

222
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:03,860
And it's not called the
vine of souls for nothing.

223
00:07:03,861 --> 00:07:04,694
It's a,

224
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:05,420
uh,

225
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:05,660
it,

226
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,041
it's a,

227
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:10,280
it's an extraordinary
portal into other realms.

228
00:07:10,281 --> 00:07:10,580
And,

229
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,750
and in some ways,

230
00:07:11,751 --> 00:07:15,060
those realms are associated with death
and perhaps of what waits for us after

231
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:15,261
death.

232
00:07:15,261 --> 00:07:16,520
Nobody knows the answer to that.

233
00:07:16,521 --> 00:07:17,354
But in I was,

234
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:21,680
you have certain experiences relating to
that and right from the beginning when

235
00:07:21,681 --> 00:07:23,240
I started to drink Iowasca,

236
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:28,040
I mean this sounds nuts to anybody who
hasn't done DMT or who hasn't drunk

237
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:32,390
Iowasca but you do meet
intelligent entities and more
and more around the world,

238
00:07:32,391 --> 00:07:33,980
people drinking Iowasca a meeting,

239
00:07:33,981 --> 00:07:35,030
this goddess figure,

240
00:07:35,031 --> 00:07:36,620
she might appear as a serpent,

241
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,390
she might appear as a woman,

242
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:41,360
she might appear as some
kind of panther or Jaguar,

243
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:43,100
a very powerful,

244
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,520
tough love kind of lady who reveals to
you the truth about yourself and just

245
00:07:49,851 --> 00:07:50,121
says,

246
00:07:50,121 --> 00:07:50,600
you know,

247
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,610
you fucking deal with it
cause that's how you are.

248
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:56,270
And what the truth that was revealed
to me from quite early on was my

249
00:07:56,271 --> 00:07:59,930
relationship with cannabis and got out
of balance and I needed to get it back

250
00:07:59,931 --> 00:08:00,441
into balance.

251
00:08:00,441 --> 00:08:04,220
And of course I ignored those
messages completely because I was so,

252
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,030
I was so much in,

253
00:08:06,031 --> 00:08:08,000
in love with my cannabis relationship,

254
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:10,130
but that my wife said that
really it was like a head,

255
00:08:10,131 --> 00:08:10,964
a mistress.

256
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,451
You know,

257
00:08:11,451 --> 00:08:14,840
who I spent all my time with was the
camp was the cannabis rather than rather

258
00:08:14,841 --> 00:08:15,590
than her,

259
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:17,360
and this went on for many,

260
00:08:17,361 --> 00:08:17,811
many years.

261
00:08:17,811 --> 00:08:19,280
Now the paranoia aspect,

262
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:19,551
okay,

263
00:08:19,551 --> 00:08:21,020
I'm going to bare my heart here.

264
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,760
And you know,

265
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,800
I believe in being honest,

266
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:29,090
the paranoia aspect began to affect my
relationship with my beloved partner,

267
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:29,841
Santa,

268
00:08:29,841 --> 00:08:34,841
who I just love from the bottom
of my heart and she is the best,

269
00:08:34,911 --> 00:08:35,301
the most,

270
00:08:35,301 --> 00:08:36,530
the most pure hearted,

271
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:37,461
generous,

272
00:08:37,461 --> 00:08:38,061
spirited,

273
00:08:38,061 --> 00:08:38,990
loving lady.

274
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:39,710
It's possible,

275
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:40,550
possible to imagine,

276
00:08:40,551 --> 00:08:44,180
but I started to develop all
kinds of suspicions about her,

277
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,130
which were completely groundless.

278
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:50,070
I started to imagine all sorts of stuff
we're going on and then I started to act

279
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:53,030
to act towards her as though
those suspicions were real.

280
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:58,020
And all of this was also related
to my consumption of cannabis.

281
00:08:58,021 --> 00:09:00,300
It was not caused by my
consumption of cannabis.

282
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:03,540
I think this is a latent
aspect of my own personality.

283
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:07,620
It was being revealed
by this over abuse of,

284
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,100
of the,

285
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,670
of the cannabis herp and,

286
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:14,920
and therefore I was making my beautiful
partner's life a misery sometimes,

287
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:16,643
not every day,

288
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,730
but sometimes.

289
00:09:17,731 --> 00:09:19,350
And she was patiently
putting up with this,

290
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:24,351
but she was suffering and we
went down to Brazil in October,

291
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:28,350
2011 and if I had been told when we got
on that plane and went down to Brazil,

292
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,390
that when I came back two weeks later,

293
00:09:30,391 --> 00:09:32,370
I would probably never
smoked cannabis again.

294
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:34,770
I would have laughed in the face
of the person who told me that.

295
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:40,050
But the encounters that I had
with the spirit of Iowasca,

296
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:40,801
whatever that is,

297
00:09:40,801 --> 00:09:43,110
I'm willing to accept that
there is no spirit of Iowasca,

298
00:09:43,111 --> 00:09:45,090
that it's all something we
generate out of our brains.

299
00:09:45,091 --> 00:09:45,924
But for me,

300
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,360
she manifests as a real,

301
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:50,100
like a goddess and the
encounters I had with that,

302
00:09:50,101 --> 00:09:51,360
and I do think she's real.

303
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,130
That's just my personal belief system.

304
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:57,570
And those encounters that I had were
incredibly powerful and she took me to a

305
00:09:57,571 --> 00:10:01,110
place that was something like hell and
she took me to a place that was something

306
00:10:01,111 --> 00:10:04,590
like the judgment scene in
the ancient Egyptian religion.

307
00:10:04,591 --> 00:10:09,480
Now the judgment scene is a place where
your heart is weighed in the scales

308
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:14,340
against the feather of truth and harmony
and cosmic justice and you do not want

309
00:10:14,341 --> 00:10:16,410
your heart to be heavy in those skills.

310
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:19,230
You want to be able to look
back on your life and say,

311
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:20,130
I did good.

312
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,410
I did not add to the misery in the world.

313
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:26,310
I did something worthwhile
with this incredible gift
of life that the university

314
00:10:26,311 --> 00:10:27,620
gave me and I and,

315
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,940
and everything you've done every second,

316
00:10:29,941 --> 00:10:32,610
every minute of your life
is completely transparent.

317
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,510
Every thought,

318
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,740
every action,

319
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:39,150
everything you did from the moment that
you became conscious until the moment of

320
00:10:39,151 --> 00:10:42,180
your death is laid out before you
and there's no hiding from it.

321
00:10:42,181 --> 00:10:46,890
Like we great at creating illusions
about our own behavior and persuading

322
00:10:46,891 --> 00:10:50,490
ourselves that we're behaving just
fine in the judgment hall of Osiris,

323
00:10:50,491 --> 00:10:52,020
which is also called the hall of mark,

324
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:53,250
where the scene takes place.

325
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,770
All of that stripped away
and you confront the truth.

326
00:10:55,771 --> 00:10:59,850
And I was put there and I confronted
the truth about myself and I saw the way

327
00:10:59,851 --> 00:11:02,380
that I was behaving
towards my partner and,

328
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:02,691
and,

329
00:11:02,691 --> 00:11:02,961
and,

330
00:11:02,961 --> 00:11:06,240
and I was shown that this
had to stop otherwise,

331
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:09,510
otherwise I was going to
pay a huge price for it.

332
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:10,860
And it,

333
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:13,650
I had a series of terrifying,

334
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,420
terrifying experiences,

335
00:11:15,421 --> 00:11:18,870
which my partner saw the science I've
shared with me because we were drinking

336
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,130
IOWASCA together.

337
00:11:20,131 --> 00:11:24,300
And at a certain point entities came to
her and she had the experience of her

338
00:11:24,301 --> 00:11:26,100
heart being pulled out of her chest.

339
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,690
And the entity said to her,

340
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:29,280
and she thought she was going to die.

341
00:11:29,281 --> 00:11:30,630
And the entity said to her,

342
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,870
we're going to do this to
you to teach grammar lesson.

343
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,570
And Santa's communicated that to me.

344
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:41,690
And I would rank that as probably the
single most terrifying night of my entire

345
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:43,050
life.

346
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:48,050
And I've had some terrifying nights
that was just absolutely scared,

347
00:11:48,361 --> 00:11:49,020
rigid.

348
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:49,471
And I,

349
00:11:49,471 --> 00:11:51,930
and I came out of that with,

350
00:11:51,931 --> 00:11:52,380
uh,

351
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,330
a feeling of very clear feeling in a,

352
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:58,390
in Iowasca we have sharings the next
day after you've drunk the brew,

353
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:01,310
you share with the rest of the group who
you've drunk with the experiences you

354
00:12:01,311 --> 00:12:02,081
had the night before,

355
00:12:02,081 --> 00:12:03,100
as much as you want to share.

356
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,600
And what I shared,

357
00:12:04,601 --> 00:12:07,810
because I still didn't believe
that I could stop smoking cannabis.

358
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:13,140
What I shared was that I was going to
change my relationship with cannabis and,

359
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:17,590
and to get to a place where cannabis was
serving me again rather than me serving

360
00:12:17,591 --> 00:12:18,424
her.

361
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,060
Um,

362
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:19,331
and,

363
00:12:19,331 --> 00:12:20,500
and that's what I believed.

364
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,060
But when I got back to England,

365
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,193
long flight,

366
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,850
what's the first thing I do?

367
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,530
I get out my vaporizer,

368
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,850
get out my stash,

369
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,010
fire up the vaporizer,

370
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,400
and fill a nice bag of

371
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:33,843
the vapor.

372
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,410
You said sort of stylistically,

373
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,011
well,

374
00:12:36,011 --> 00:12:36,844
I miss it.

375
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:37,481
I miss it.

376
00:12:37,481 --> 00:12:37,811
You know,

377
00:12:37,811 --> 00:12:38,270
this was a,

378
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:43,270
that would be a cannabis
is such a beautiful sensual
ally if she's used right.

379
00:12:43,301 --> 00:12:43,961
And what do you think?

380
00:12:43,961 --> 00:12:47,470
It's just an imbalance issue
with the CBD THC ratio and the,

381
00:12:47,471 --> 00:12:47,741
let me,

382
00:12:47,741 --> 00:12:48,300
let me just,

383
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,390
let me just finish with what,

384
00:12:49,391 --> 00:12:50,260
with what happened to me.

385
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:54,730
So I fill up the bag and I'm down there
in my basement and I take the first and

386
00:12:54,731 --> 00:12:58,900
I take the first drawer and I'm suddenly
filled with the most intense feelings

387
00:12:58,901 --> 00:13:00,430
of horror and loading.

388
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:04,570
And it is exactly like I'm back in
that space that Iowaska took me to,

389
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:07,270
and I try a second puff and I can't do it.

390
00:13:07,271 --> 00:13:09,010
I physically could not continue.

391
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:09,170
I,

392
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:11,110
I knew that I just,

393
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,280
I just could not continue.

394
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,320
I expressed the vapor out of the bag,

395
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,570
I crumpled up the bag,

396
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:17,830
I put it away.

397
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:21,170
And the next day I got rid
of several ounces of coke.

398
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:21,870
Cannabis.

399
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:22,690
Yeah,

400
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:23,201
I know,

401
00:13:23,201 --> 00:13:23,381
I know.

402
00:13:23,381 --> 00:13:24,040
It's terrible.

403
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,060
It's a terrible thing to do.

404
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:25,580
But,

405
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:25,800
but,

406
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,280
but for me it was the right thing to do.

407
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,480
24 years,

408
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:31,000
nonstop relationship with cannabis,

409
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,680
definitely abusing the herb.

410
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:36,730
I had got to the point where the only
rational course of action was what I was

411
00:13:36,731 --> 00:13:37,870
shown in Iowasca,

412
00:13:37,871 --> 00:13:38,531
which was to stop.

413
00:13:38,531 --> 00:13:42,250
And I don't know whether it was because
there was way too much THC and not

414
00:13:42,251 --> 00:13:43,180
enough CBD,

415
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:47,680
or whether it was just me not being
responsible for my own behavior.

416
00:13:47,681 --> 00:13:48,221
I go,

417
00:13:48,221 --> 00:13:48,401
uh,

418
00:13:48,401 --> 00:13:48,971
go around,

419
00:13:48,971 --> 00:13:49,211
you know,

420
00:13:49,211 --> 00:13:51,430
saying that I believe
in adult responsibility,

421
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:51,851
and I do,

422
00:13:51,851 --> 00:13:53,620
but I don't think I was being responsible.

423
00:13:53,621 --> 00:13:55,720
I don't think I was using the
herb in a responsible way.

424
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:57,910
I don't think I was using
it in a respectful way,

425
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,290
and I paid a price for that.

426
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:05,130
[inaudible]

427
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:23,003
okay.

428
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:32,960
Freaks and geeks level.
