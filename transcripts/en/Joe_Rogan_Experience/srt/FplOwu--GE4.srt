Guys need to cut it out.
Try Casting.

2
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,730
Did you ever organize parents podcast
brought to you by the flashlight?

3
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,350
What is the fleshlight?
Fleshlight is a vagina made out of rubber.

4
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,600
That's an a thing that looks
like a flashlight and John half.

5
00:00:22,601 --> 00:00:24,590
Ron The brilliant
comedian John had fallen,

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,990
had a very funny point and he said
they really should make a fleshlight.

7
00:00:27,991 --> 00:00:32,160
That's a flashlight because you
never know what your flashlight is,

8
00:00:32,161 --> 00:00:36,300
but you always know where your
fleshlight is. You laughed.

9
00:00:36,301 --> 00:00:39,810
You can't help but laugh
because it's funny. Hi.

10
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,490
If you go to Joe rogan.net and click on
the link to the flashlight and enter in

11
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,970
the code named Rogan, you will get 15%
off the number one sex toy for men.

12
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,850
Shazamm bitches,
Duncan trussell's in the house.

13
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,620
We ready to get off free con.

14
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:02,620
Hi.
Hi

15
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:07,270
Dunkin. Hi. We got everything going on
here folks. We took Alpha brain pills,

16
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:11,800
Alpha brain by on it,
o n n I t.com.

17
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,070
We've been selling these here on the
podcast telling people about them.

18
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,520
They sold out completely quickly and
you know, there's always going to be,

19
00:01:18,521 --> 00:01:21,640
some people don't, don't like
certain things, but the response,

20
00:01:21,641 --> 00:01:25,560
a positive response from these things,
it's been fucking tremendous. And a,

21
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:28,930
even Tim Ferriss loved it and he thought
the, you know, he read the ingredients,

22
00:01:28,931 --> 00:01:31,810
he said they were great, said
it's a perfect combination. It's,

23
00:01:31,811 --> 00:01:35,380
which is really nice to hear because
he was fucking brilliant man.

24
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:38,920
What an interesting guy. But reading
his book, the four hour work,

25
00:01:38,921 --> 00:01:40,780
while the four hour body is
the one I've been reading,

26
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:45,610
it's so fucking informative.
There's so much in there man,

27
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:50,380
about so many different things and his
own personal detailed examinations and

28
00:01:50,381 --> 00:01:53,740
experience. He's done with his
own body, like gaining 30 pounds,

29
00:01:53,741 --> 00:01:57,880
like getting over a course of like six
weeks and did all this bodybuilding stuff

30
00:01:57,881 --> 00:02:01,230
and all these different things where
he combined foods and nutrients in

31
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:05,260
different times of the day and he detailed
everything and it's fucking really

32
00:02:05,261 --> 00:02:07,420
interesting. And one of the
things that he detailed his,

33
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:12,690
that his balls were getting cooked by
his cell phone and it was killing his

34
00:02:12,941 --> 00:02:16,840
sperm count. Like he's totally healthy.
It just gained all this muscle, right?

35
00:02:16,841 --> 00:02:20,050
He's lifting weights, doing all
this kettle bells and shit figures.

36
00:02:20,051 --> 00:02:24,910
He's healthy as a horse. Good gets his.
Is is berm checked just for whatever.

37
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:27,100
I mean I'm, no, it's gonna to
come back. Awesome. You know,

38
00:02:27,101 --> 00:02:28,840
it's was one of those things,
my loads are going to be awesome.

39
00:02:28,841 --> 00:02:31,230
I'm going to be glowing.
Well he goes and he's,

40
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,850
his sperm is like down significantly,

41
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:38,140
so the only thing he does to
change it is he adds some,

42
00:02:38,141 --> 00:02:41,890
I believe Brazil nuts to
his diet because Brazil,

43
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,530
Brazil nuts contain certain minerals,
minerals or something like that.

44
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:49,360
It's supposed to be good for your sperm
count and took his cell phone out of his

45
00:02:49,361 --> 00:02:51,250
pocket,
did no longer had a cell phone on him.

46
00:02:51,251 --> 00:02:56,251
Apparently the studies online that show
a significant correlation between having

47
00:02:57,071 --> 00:03:00,160
your cell phone in your pocket
and low count. Can I ask

48
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:03,650
you why it was important to
him to have a good sperm count?

49
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:06,500
Well, we wanted to know what was going
on with his body because his whole,

50
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:10,370
his whole thing is about him experimenting
with his body and trying different

51
00:03:10,371 --> 00:03:13,760
things that people try to get
optimum performance out of your body.

52
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:17,800
His sperm count, the number of sperm
that are live and healthy living.

53
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:20,570
It's not the loads,
the size of the loads could be the same.

54
00:03:20,571 --> 00:03:25,160
But inside those loads is just how
many words a dead fucking does it.

55
00:03:25,161 --> 00:03:29,270
He goes ship,
he'll look good,

56
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,440
arrives like, you know, you're calm,
smart boy. He's the fucking boat.

57
00:03:33,441 --> 00:03:38,240
Hits the beach at Normandy and
every living soldiers just dead.

58
00:03:38,241 --> 00:03:41,380
They're just slumped over and
it's terrifying. So you're so,

59
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:46,390
so my loads could be filled with
dad wore a good friend of mine,

60
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:51,560
had a really hard time getting
his girlfriend pregnant,
his wife pregnant. And um,

61
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:55,700
they went to a doctor and he's not even
40 and he found out that he had a really

62
00:03:55,701 --> 00:03:58,940
low sperm count and he's kind of freaked
out about it. You know, it was like,

63
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:01,130
what the fuck? And He's thinking
about all these different things,

64
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,970
but one of those things could
easily be your cell phone.

65
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:09,770
Your cell phone is cooking your balls.
Your laptop does that too. Yeah.

66
00:04:09,771 --> 00:04:12,980
Well that's heat though. Differences, what
you're talking about heat or radiation?

67
00:04:12,981 --> 00:04:16,520
No, it's the signal. It's the megahertz.
It's a spectrum. The radio spectrum,

68
00:04:16,521 --> 00:04:19,460
but cell phone during her.
That's a good question.

69
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:24,260
I apparently having the receiver right
next to your balls is like really bad for

70
00:04:24,261 --> 00:04:28,630
your balls. Your balls are just
battling this radiation. Now this for,

71
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:32,960
I just want to say I've done no research
other than read what he said so I

72
00:04:32,961 --> 00:04:36,890
haven't rehearsed researches online.
The, it's like the brain cancer.

73
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,980
It's switches left and right every time.
You know, every time they say, oh no,

74
00:04:39,981 --> 00:04:41,930
cell phones give you high brain cancer,

75
00:04:41,931 --> 00:04:45,380
but that they say is true one day and
then just treat onfi. I don't think,

76
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:49,370
first of all, I don't think it has to give
you brain damage to be fucking you up.

77
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:53,990
It could be fucking you up in subtle
ways. It's very possible. It doesn't,

78
00:04:53,991 --> 00:04:55,610
it doesn't necessarily
have to give you tumors,

79
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:59,750
but if it's the potential for giving you
tumors is there, what does that mean?

80
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,660
That he'd either kills you
or it does nothing to you.

81
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:07,930
So either it turns your fucking head
into a grapefruit and pineapple start

82
00:05:08,331 --> 00:05:11,510
growing off the side of your head,
your brain, or it does nothing.

83
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:15,500
That's ridiculous to me. To me that,
that seems like we're being silly.

84
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:18,490
That's a silly way of looking
at health that like you, you,

85
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,580
it has no effect on you other
than maybe kills your brain,

86
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,010
this

87
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:25,311
thing.

88
00:05:25,311 --> 00:05:30,311
And in Virginia there's a part of
Virginia that is a cell phone free zone

89
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:33,140
because there's some kind of
radio telescopes out there
and they don't want it.

90
00:05:33,141 --> 00:05:36,710
They want to have the purest signal
and they don't want any disruptions.

91
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,210
So there's a name for these zones.

92
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,180
And there are these people who
have been moving to this town.

93
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:44,650
I can't remember the name of it. Green
something. West Virginia. It's Tom. I,

94
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,180
it's my last tweet. But they've
been moving to this town, uh,

95
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:52,910
because they think that they're sensitive
to cell phone frequencies and they

96
00:05:52,911 --> 00:05:55,580
break out in rashes.
And this article,

97
00:05:55,980 --> 00:06:00,740
it said that like the has
acknowledged that this does exist,

98
00:06:00,741 --> 00:06:04,730
this health problem does
exist, but there's no proof
that it's from cell phones.

99
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:08,990
But there are people who get really sick
when they're in cell phone areas and

100
00:06:08,991 --> 00:06:13,520
you know, there, I'm sure a lot of them
are kooks you know, but uh, so you know,

101
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,360
who knows.

102
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,260
Well that's a good guess because a
lot of everybody with when whenever

103
00:06:18,261 --> 00:06:19,580
outrageous claims come up,

104
00:06:19,581 --> 00:06:21,740
you've got to think a certain
percentage of them are Kooks.

105
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,160
But I don't think we've
completely assessed the
effects of all these wireless.

106
00:06:27,771 --> 00:06:27,990
Yes,

107
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:28,980
no.
Think of that shit man.

108
00:06:28,981 --> 00:06:33,981
Think about the fucking megabytes of
information pouring through the air at any

109
00:06:34,611 --> 00:06:38,470
second. It's, it's like, if all like the,

110
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:43,570
the information that can create the
beautiful world of Warcraft is like flying

111
00:06:44,581 --> 00:06:47,010
around me at every second.
That can't be good for you.

112
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,730
That's so much information just
blasting out of your modem at all times.

113
00:06:50,731 --> 00:06:53,250
How is that not going to
affect you in some way?

114
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:57,920
Yeah. Even if you can't process
the information rationally
is your brain's still

115
00:06:57,921 --> 00:07:01,000
tuning into it, like all these
wireless signals that are in our,

116
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:06,070
I mean we never think about that because
really it that wireless like real full

117
00:07:07,431 --> 00:07:10,780
wireless like we have now with
like Internet and you know,

118
00:07:10,781 --> 00:07:14,690
and radio signals where you're cordless
phones are on certain frequency and then

119
00:07:14,691 --> 00:07:18,430
of course cell phones. This is
really kind of recent, right?

120
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:21,490
How many years has it been
slowly since the 80s right?

121
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:25,380
Yeah, but even in this started, I don't
know when Ra wireless routers started.

122
00:07:25,381 --> 00:07:29,490
I mean like in niche more recently.
Yeah. So yeah, there were cell phones,

123
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:33,060
but I bet the information that
was coming through is less.

124
00:07:33,061 --> 00:07:35,100
It had to have been because
fewer people had cell phones.

125
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:39,590
I remember the first, first time I got a
computer that was a wireless, I was like,

126
00:07:39,591 --> 00:07:41,870
this is the craziest fucking
thing I've ever seen in my life.

127
00:07:41,871 --> 00:07:44,900
I'm no where near a wire and I'm on line.

128
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,460
That's when you really start to think
how crazy the fucking internet is that

129
00:07:49,461 --> 00:07:54,461
this thing that I can't see can fly
through the air at like ridiculous speeds

130
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:59,180
and sits on my laptop and I get all the
answers to anything. It's basically,

131
00:07:59,181 --> 00:08:03,470
this is a magic box that lets me have
every answer to everything that's ever

132
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:05,900
been asked that Cuban pings of answered,

133
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:08,670
but what, what's coming through
the air? Isn't it just that is it?

134
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:12,080
Is it like a sound that's telling
your computer? It's a signal.

135
00:08:12,081 --> 00:08:14,360
It's like ones and Zeros
basically certain frequency.

136
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:18,720
It's like the old dial tone sound that
used to dial in using a 50 60 modem but

137
00:08:18,721 --> 00:08:19,554
quiet.

138
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:24,010
I thought believed that wireless Internet
was invented by Nikola Tesla too.

139
00:08:24,011 --> 00:08:27,220
I believe the concept of it came
from his work. Is that true?

140
00:08:27,221 --> 00:08:31,390
You did that drunk Tesla drunken moment
and if you haven't seen is folks,

141
00:08:31,391 --> 00:08:33,280
it is one.
I retweeted it just the other day.

142
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:36,850
One of my funny and one of my favorite
videos and I think it's the one of the

143
00:08:36,851 --> 00:08:39,910
funniest videos ever because it's
first of all, it's so informative.

144
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:43,510
It's really interesting. A lot of people
don't even know who Nikola Tesla is.

145
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:46,030
He was just amazing genius.

146
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:50,110
And one of my personal
best examples of that,

147
00:08:50,111 --> 00:08:51,340
I have a lot of other,

148
00:08:51,341 --> 00:08:54,520
I have a lot of theories about brilliant
people and a lot of the brilliant

149
00:08:54,521 --> 00:08:58,530
people that I've have been crazy. You
know, there's, there's something there.

150
00:08:58,531 --> 00:09:00,990
They might not be a hundred percent crazy,
you know,

151
00:09:00,991 --> 00:09:05,340
maybe it's only 10% grazie maybe
they're hanging on with 20 or 30% crazy.

152
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:09,390
But to,
I almost believed to be super,

153
00:09:09,391 --> 00:09:13,290
super brilliant at something like Tesla
was like at that level so far beyond

154
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:17,760
everybody else can almost like you have
to be quirks tuned out. You can't be,

155
00:09:17,761 --> 00:09:19,200
can't be balanced.
There's no way.

156
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,410
Well remember when you were
a kid and you would play,

157
00:09:21,411 --> 00:09:25,520
make believe with your friends and
whatever that was that you did. Like,

158
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:29,570
I don't know, cowboys and Indians, I
play with my daughter all the time.

159
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,790
So when you,
so now imagine this,

160
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:36,770
imagine that you had to play that
game for the rest of your life,

161
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:40,280
even though you knew you were playing
with kids and you knew it was just this

162
00:09:40,281 --> 00:09:44,840
big kids' game. Maybe when people
get super, super, super smart,

163
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:49,340
they recognize that they're
sort of trapped in this
dimension where everybody's

164
00:09:49,341 --> 00:09:52,130
deeply engrossed in what
amounts to a baby's game,

165
00:09:52,131 --> 00:09:55,730
that they all things very important.
They all think it's really serious,

166
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,500
but you recognize,
oh no,

167
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:02,710
this isn't even a a 1% of
what exists in the world.

168
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:04,610
This isn't even 1% these,

169
00:10:04,611 --> 00:10:09,080
these idiots are playing the game of
like presidents and country and army and

170
00:10:09,081 --> 00:10:12,470
police officer, a married
person, but it's just the game.

171
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:14,600
Maybe when you get really,
really smart,

172
00:10:14,601 --> 00:10:17,660
you see that and all of a
sudden you don't. Not If,

173
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:20,570
if you're not really smart
or if you're just one of us,

174
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:23,690
you just normally play the game. You
don't even think about it. You wake up,

175
00:10:23,691 --> 00:10:25,220
go to work.
He was playing the game.

176
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:27,850
But imagine if you knew this
was a make believe games.

177
00:10:27,851 --> 00:10:29,900
So every day you woke up and you're like,
well,

178
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:34,490
got to go play with play this absurd
silly game and you just knew it.

179
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,880
Then you'd start doing weird shit
cause it'd be hard for you to just

180
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:41,210
instinctually do all the different
things that everyone does.

181
00:10:41,211 --> 00:10:44,870
You start doing weird shit and people
would be like, why? And he's kind of off,

182
00:10:44,871 --> 00:10:47,570
isn't he? He's a little
off. He doesn't shake hands.

183
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:52,940
I wonder why then shaking hands.
What's shaking hands is stupid.

184
00:10:52,941 --> 00:10:55,190
Fuck, I don't want to slap
technicals. I'm sorry.

185
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:57,320
I don't feel like rubbing tentacle.
Yeah,

186
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,290
those with you today.
You don't want to touch people.

187
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:02,170
You don't want to offer up your
sword and I feel disrespected.

188
00:11:02,171 --> 00:11:04,980
You know that's what it was. You would
offer up your sword hand. That's right.

189
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:07,120
You couldn't, you couldn't
kill each other at that moment.

190
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:09,220
I'm not going to stab yet.
That's not wine England.

191
00:11:09,221 --> 00:11:12,140
He's still driving the left hand side
and then we drive on the right hand side.

192
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,760
They drive it the left because that was
how you wrote a horse and had your sword

193
00:11:15,761 --> 00:11:16,594
in your right hand.

194
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,240
So some Douche bags coming in the other
direction and you want to get them on

195
00:11:19,241 --> 00:11:22,630
your right side so he can sort
his ass. Jesus Christ, they still,

196
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,430
that's why they drive on
that side of the street.

197
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:27,460
I mean it makes sense because look,
realistically,

198
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:29,830
it was just a couple of hundred years
ago and people were riding horses

199
00:11:29,831 --> 00:11:31,720
everywhere. I'm, these were
tough. That's how it works.

200
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,020
That's not that long ago man.
That's,

201
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,040
it's amazing when you stop
and think about the end,

202
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:40,690
Nikola Tesla is really one of the
reasons why we're so fucking advanced.

203
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,620
If you look back at the inventions this
guy was responsible for and all the

204
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:48,130
patents at this guy was responsible for,
it's a brilliant thing.

205
00:11:48,131 --> 00:11:51,780
And I don't remember at feet here in a
fucking peep about him in high school. I,

206
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:55,660
I, somebody told about him, uh, when
I was in college and some, some,

207
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:57,160
it wasn't even in a class.

208
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:00,790
Some dude was a reading something about
the guy and he looked interesting on the

209
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:04,780
cover and I think that's how I learned
about Nikola Tesla. But I mean,

210
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:09,390
I obviously, I didn't take
any science shirts, but I, I,

211
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,770
I never hear about you
hear about Thomas Edison.

212
00:12:11,771 --> 00:12:14,830
You hear about Benjamin Franklin,
the people that invented a May. Oh,

213
00:12:14,831 --> 00:12:18,880
you've had electricity. He wouldn't
have told you who the fucking keys. No,

214
00:12:18,881 --> 00:12:21,670
Nikola Tesla was talking to
aliens, bitch. All right.

215
00:12:21,671 --> 00:12:26,671
That guy was inventing everything and
wound up dying like completely crazy at

216
00:12:28,151 --> 00:12:28,690
the end.
Yeah.

217
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:32,230
Yeah. He, well, he, yeah, he
was a, I mean, I feel like
I'm quoting the drunk history,

218
00:12:32,231 --> 00:12:33,300
but he is essentially,

219
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:38,310
it was in love with a white pigeon and
he was wandering around New York and,

220
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:42,820
you know, and you know, New York
was lit up with his technology, um,

221
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:47,110
and he was just broke and it was all
there because it came out of his mind.

222
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,130
You know what,
I'll give you a weird little trivia

223
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,150
money from him. Was it Edison? Okay.

224
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:54,420
Uh, I, well, no, it
was how many die broke?

225
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:58,860
He died broke because he
had some bad luck. Uh, his,

226
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:02,010
um,
one of his main laboratories burnt down.

227
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,790
He had basically figured out in his mind,

228
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:10,530
a way to generate, I, I guess you'd
consider it wireless electricity,

229
00:13:10,531 --> 00:13:14,190
like he had this idea that you could
there rather than having to have like a,

230
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:18,510
an engine,
a generating the electricity that

231
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:23,690
the, I don't know, reality
itself for every, you know,

232
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,170
bit of reality had compressed within it,

233
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:30,150
enough energy to supply anything.
There's like energy all around us.

234
00:13:30,151 --> 00:13:30,781
That was his idea.

235
00:13:30,781 --> 00:13:33,900
We're just surrounded by energy
and there's a way to tap into it.

236
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:38,190
And so he was way to broadcast electricity
later. Radio. Well, yeah, yeah, exactly.

237
00:13:38,191 --> 00:13:42,960
I mean, I guess you could
if, assuming that you didn't
have to have like, you know,

238
00:13:42,961 --> 00:13:47,320
a hydroelectric dam or oil
or whatever it, it to, uh,

239
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:48,690
create energy,

240
00:13:48,691 --> 00:13:53,691
assuming that in every inch of the
universe there was infinite energy,

241
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:56,760
then you would just,
every house would become a power plant.

242
00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:00,120
It wouldn't all be based on wherever
the main energy is coming from,

243
00:14:00,121 --> 00:14:01,800
the nuclear power plant or whatever.

244
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:04,590
It would be some sort of device
that you could put in your house.

245
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,410
They could channel the,
the energy, you know,

246
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:11,270
channel. But what, what are they
calling that energy? Like what is it?

247
00:14:11,271 --> 00:14:13,310
Just something we haven't
figured out and discovered yet?

248
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,110
Something we haven't figured out.

249
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:19,250
And so instead of this the crude method
of pulling oil out of the ground and

250
00:14:19,251 --> 00:14:21,740
light it on fire,
that there's another step.

251
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:25,460
Well, yeah, or you know, I mean it's
obvious. I mean, look at fucking, uh,

252
00:14:25,461 --> 00:14:28,370
the solar panels, right? I
mean, there's a, there's,

253
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:33,420
there's enough energy from the sun that
to keep every organic form make that the

254
00:14:33,641 --> 00:14:35,590
law. Why don't they just
make that roofs? You know,

255
00:14:35,591 --> 00:14:38,440
in California you have to
have solar panels on it.

256
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:41,940
Well, it's no fuck laws, man.
You don't need to make more laws.

257
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,490
The last thing we need is more people
telling people what they have to spend

258
00:14:44,491 --> 00:14:45,320
their fucking money.

259
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,890
It's also expensive to make them an
n n the a amount of time it takes you

260
00:14:48,891 --> 00:14:52,250
forever to recoup the amount it
costs to install and make them right.

261
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:56,030
Right now it's financially a good deal,
but they can be done.

262
00:14:56,031 --> 00:14:58,970
They give you a tag backs or whatever
they're called. Uh, I don't know.

263
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,730
They give you money back. I would think
about doing it just to get off the grid.

264
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,870
That's fine. Sand when I
lived in Colorado, I wanted to

265
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:08,380
do that. Tom. Um, what Chia
Saunas [inaudible] yeah.

266
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,890
Fuck. I can't forget his name.
A friend of mine. Anyway, he uh,

267
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,520
he had a windmill set up at
his house. That's cool. Yeah,

268
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:20,180
those are awesome man. I love passing
those fields and when males, it's so cool.

269
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:23,570
Yeah. He, um, he had a windmill
set up at his house and he, uh,

270
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,860
he was giving money back.

271
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:28,730
Like they would give him money rather
than me giving energy back to the grid,

272
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,640
which is crazy.
He was making numbers on energy.

273
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:35,000
You know what, man, the thing,
the thing I've been thinking
lately is that, uh, it's,

274
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:39,890
we live in such a funny time because I
guess people just don't like if you start

275
00:15:39,891 --> 00:15:41,180
saying things like, no, you know what?

276
00:15:41,181 --> 00:15:44,450
I have the feeling there's actually
another energy source out there that we

277
00:15:44,451 --> 00:15:49,451
haven't even stumbled upon yet that has
like all a million times more energy

278
00:15:49,461 --> 00:15:51,830
than you could ever need.
If you say that now people really will,

279
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:54,800
you seem kind of like a fruit or a
flake or an 88 or they are like here,

280
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:56,030
well bays it in science.

281
00:15:56,031 --> 00:15:58,490
You don't know what that is or you
don't know what you're talking about.

282
00:15:58,491 --> 00:16:02,420
But there was a time when if you
were just talking about electricity,

283
00:16:02,421 --> 00:16:06,680
you would've seen like an absolute
lunatic. Like if you went around in the,

284
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:09,860
I dunno, 12 hundreds and
started telling people, listen,

285
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:15,050
there's this fucking energy
called electricity that's
more powerful than fire.

286
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:19,160
You can use it to, you can, you can run
it through wires and if you touch it,

287
00:16:19,161 --> 00:16:22,730
you'll get electrocuted. They go like,
get this fucking, which on the stake?

288
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,290
What are you talking about? War Lock. We
are going to harness lightening. Yeah.

289
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:31,610
Yeah. What are you talking Frankenstein?
What are you talking about?

290
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:34,850
But so in the same way, man,
I think that there's probably,

291
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:37,700
I've been thinking about, it's
such a, I have this weird idea.

292
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:40,950
Do you remember when Frankenstein,
when he made that fucking chick, when?

293
00:16:40,951 --> 00:16:43,920
When were you made when they made
Frankenstein and they actually had to get

294
00:16:43,921 --> 00:16:46,110
lightning to make him a lot of,

295
00:16:46,111 --> 00:16:48,360
they had a good idea how to
hit the tower with lightning.

296
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:52,440
Wait, you mean they really did that?
Are you saying that one of the movies,

297
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,210
the movie back to the future?

298
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,980
Hmm.
One of the Frankenstein movies.

299
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:59,750
Remember when they did them? I know,
I know Frankenstein was fucking,

300
00:16:59,751 --> 00:17:04,550
I know that like Frankenstein what I've
like had to have like a hit of whitening

301
00:17:04,551 --> 00:17:07,220
to bring the person to life. That's
right. I'm sorry I interrupted you.

302
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,010
So go back to what you're saying. Well No,
what I was thinking is it's like, okay,

303
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:13,910
so like what if like you look at like,

304
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:17,060
I know this is something I so wish that
you can do and you'll never be able to

305
00:17:17,061 --> 00:17:17,391
do it,

306
00:17:17,391 --> 00:17:20,900
but it would be so amazing to look at
from the beginning of time to right now

307
00:17:20,901 --> 00:17:25,880
and like a 22nd fast forward to see what
that blur of happening look like or the,

308
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:27,750
you know, the good, the evolution.

309
00:17:27,751 --> 00:17:32,751
It'd be so fun to be able to see in a
real way what evolution look like from,

310
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:36,260
you know, the evolution of
a fucking, I don't know,

311
00:17:36,261 --> 00:17:39,650
the evolution of a chicken and do
a or a dinosaur and do a chicken.

312
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:42,950
It'd be amazing to watch. That thing
happened really fast to be really cool.

313
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:44,450
But so like,
okay,

314
00:17:44,451 --> 00:17:47,630
so this is gonna sound crazy and I'm
sorry if it seems rambling and weird cause

315
00:17:47,631 --> 00:17:51,600
I haven't quite figured
out how to articulate this
idea. But like if you have,

316
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:56,130
okay, you have fire, fire leaves
a trace, you know, where there's,

317
00:17:56,131 --> 00:18:00,360
where there's been a fire, there's
suit, there's ashes, black suit,

318
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:03,480
whatever from the carbon's being released
in the fire, right. The carbon rather.

319
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:05,670
So in the same way I was thinking,

320
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:10,380
what if there's another form of energy
that's raging through time and this form

321
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:15,240
of energy instead of leaving ashes
leaves evolved things. It's like the,

322
00:18:15,241 --> 00:18:19,710
the biproduct of the energy is that it
causes things to evolve and advance and

323
00:18:19,711 --> 00:18:23,550
grow and become more sophisticated.
You know,

324
00:18:23,551 --> 00:18:26,280
and like maybe that energy
that there's literally an,

325
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:30,540
an energy associated with evolution.
There's an energy that you can tap into.

326
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,790
And so when you see like,

327
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:36,810
which is why you know computers are so
amazing is because they can really tap

328
00:18:36,811 --> 00:18:40,740
into that energy right away in the form
of like open source software and stuff

329
00:18:40,741 --> 00:18:41,520
like that.

330
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:46,440
And you see things that go open source
or things that allow the most people to

331
00:18:46,441 --> 00:18:48,720
have the most input to the
most intelligent people.

332
00:18:48,721 --> 00:18:52,490
Having the input create the advance
in whatever the thing is. You know,

333
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,140
the classic example of it
as a silly example of it,

334
00:18:55,141 --> 00:18:59,130
it's like reddit where someone will
write something and then the top comment

335
00:18:59,131 --> 00:19:03,450
inevitably will be so fucking
funny because hundreds and
hundreds of people have

336
00:19:03,451 --> 00:19:04,890
like voted it up to the top.

337
00:19:04,891 --> 00:19:09,720
So it creates this evolved way of getting
information to float up to the surface.

338
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:13,030
So in the same way it's like, that's
brilliant. It's fucking, it's, yeah,

339
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:16,320
it's brilliant. Awesome. It's the
way our government should work.

340
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:20,490
If someone Youtube Cummins do that
too. Yeah, yeah. It goes up to the top.

341
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,580
So like that's a form of
like tuning into this energy,

342
00:19:23,581 --> 00:19:27,740
this like evolutionary force
as it's manifesting, you know,

343
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:32,460
and the form of the most, uh,
the, the comment that his mo,

344
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:36,450
the strongest comment or the comment
that works best in that particular

345
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,150
zeitgeists their paradigm goes to the top.

346
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:42,450
That comment is the fucking animal
that survives that comments.

347
00:19:42,451 --> 00:19:46,290
The animal that in its environment does
the best. And it's getting there through,

348
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,150
um, you know, people voting.

349
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:52,490
But what I'm saying is technology
like harnessed the evolutionary, uh,

350
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:57,600
flow in that situation. So I'm thinking,
okay, maybe evolution itself is an energy.

351
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,230
What if you could fucking harness
that shit? Remember in Star Trek,

352
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:03,600
what was it called?
The genesis beam or whatever.

353
00:20:03,601 --> 00:20:06,780
They blast the planet with the thing that
makes the life grow out of it all of a

354
00:20:06,781 --> 00:20:08,280
sudden. Wow. I don't remember that at all.

355
00:20:08,281 --> 00:20:12,600
Which was that the new star trek reverse
spoiler alert. No, no, it's an old one.

356
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:16,500
I think it would have to incur the
wrath of Khan. Oh, the wrath of Khan.

357
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:20,070
Don't you remember the RAF
and Ricardo [inaudible] bonds?
Fuck yeah, with the ear.

358
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:21,950
I was like,

359
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:25,970
how the fuck are you going to have the
dude from fantasy island be the bad guy

360
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:29,300
in a fucking star trek movie? I think
you did great out of here, bitch. Yeah,

361
00:20:29,301 --> 00:20:32,360
he was great. He was great. I mean
he's a great actor, don't get me wrong.

362
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:34,700
But when at the time she was like,

363
00:20:34,701 --> 00:20:37,130
this is the dumbest Shit I've ever heard
of in my life. And they're like, no.

364
00:20:37,131 --> 00:20:40,680
Ricardo Montalban he's a
very respected actor. Yeah,

365
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:44,600
he was handsome bastard man kind of pussy.

366
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:49,120
He got off of fantasy
island. Your fantasies can
through with die. Did he die?

367
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:53,920
I bet he overdosed from Posey.
I bet they'll the line of chicks.

368
00:20:53,921 --> 00:20:57,400
They wanted to fuck him in the 70s it's
probably still outside of his house.

369
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:02,230
They just get into them right now cause
I have no time for all of you girls.

370
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:05,920
Welcome to fantasy island.
He had his own midget,

371
00:21:05,921 --> 00:21:07,990
he was the first guy on
TV to have his own midget.

372
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:12,610
Yeah. And, and you know, have you ever
seen the pilot? No. It's Kinda creepy man.

373
00:21:12,611 --> 00:21:16,030
It's like diabolic like that character
Rourke, that was his name, right?

374
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:20,200
Rourke was, uh, in the pilot it was
almost like he was Satan or something.

375
00:21:20,201 --> 00:21:24,490
Like he was like some dark being
really. Yeah. Cause you know, in,

376
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,760
in history, uh, in a cult history,

377
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:31,740
which is always have amps are familiars
that a common way to know that you're

378
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:35,260
around. Like that's why, you know,
like David Lynch and twin peaks,

379
00:21:35,261 --> 00:21:37,840
that spooky little fucking
backwards talking midget,

380
00:21:37,841 --> 00:21:41,450
you know the guy that table
is for Micah. Right? Um,

381
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:43,840
so like that's an a cult symbol I like,

382
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:46,900
which is what always have
around them and lower,

383
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:51,100
they would always have like a cat,
you know, some kind of creature.

384
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:54,160
And sometimes they'd have a little
emp Earl or creature with them.

385
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:59,410
So Monto bond.
Rourke's tattoo was his name.

386
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:02,880
It seemed like in the pilot they were
thinking, let's make this like heat.

387
00:22:02,881 --> 00:22:07,750
Let's make him a feisty in character
where he's like, when he's not,

388
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:11,470
you know, he's maybe not giving
people exactly what they want.

389
00:22:11,471 --> 00:22:14,350
Cause remember some people would
want something and it fuck them up.

390
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:18,220
Didn't they redo fantasy island for a
little while? I don't know. Did they,

391
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:22,450
didn't they or was it the love boat? No,
it was fantasy island. That's Jerry Redd.

392
00:22:22,451 --> 00:22:24,220
Wilson. Yeah. That's how he died.

393
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:28,540
There's this comic named Jerry Redd
Wilson and he supposed to go and film

394
00:22:28,541 --> 00:22:33,370
fantasy island and he apparently had
meningitis and he did know he just had a

395
00:22:33,371 --> 00:22:34,180
headache.
Yeah.

396
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:37,360
Like knew something was wrong and he went
to the doctor and I guess the line was

397
00:22:37,361 --> 00:22:40,870
ridiculous and he wound up just couldn't
take it anymore and he left the doctor

398
00:22:40,871 --> 00:22:45,130
and you want to die. Oh Shit. Yeah.
Get yourself checked out people.

399
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:49,710
It's just not, not as, not a bad
thing to do. Smart. But um, point is,

400
00:22:49,711 --> 00:22:51,320
I'm pretty sure he was
going to do fantasy island.

401
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:54,850
It was a fucking great show back in
the day, dude. What a great idea.

402
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,280
People have fantasies,
they fly in,

403
00:22:57,281 --> 00:23:01,360
they get welcomed by this magic man and
it's magical island is going to make

404
00:23:01,361 --> 00:23:03,580
your dreams come true and teach
you a little lesson. Bitch.

405
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:06,970
They always taught you a nice little
lesson and g and quiet. And then let you,

406
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:09,160
you leave the island and
you kind of get it now.

407
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:12,800
Wait, did everyone, did everyone who
came in on that plane leave on the plane?

408
00:23:12,801 --> 00:23:16,570
Didn't some people not make it out? I, I,

409
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,900
I don't know.

410
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:21,130
You can't have people die on your island,
Ben Fucking,

411
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,480
you see what happens with Aruba

412
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:27,780
is said fucking 19 year old chick
from Arizona or something like that.

413
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:31,750
It's just on a vacation. And you know, a
rube was like where they turn up missing,

414
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:35,940
right? That's right. Scary was the
one with the boat. Gilligan's island.

415
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,300
But the other one with the boat love boat,

416
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:39,760
the lowest got love boat
in that show mixed up. Oh,

417
00:23:39,761 --> 00:23:43,840
did people die on the left
though? No fucking way. No.
No shows ever. I don't know.

418
00:23:43,841 --> 00:23:46,160
I probably was like,
they should

419
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,720
the love boat ship wrecks on fantasy

420
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:54,890
that didn't like go for from the love boat
become a politician. He did, I believe.

421
00:23:55,560 --> 00:24:00,450
Yeah. Yeah. I need to research that.
But I uh, I'm pretty sure he did.

422
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:04,500
I'm pretty sure he became like a senator.
So politicians are, they are this,

423
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:07,260
I cannot wait until the day
and this day will never come.

424
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:11,580
But that day when we have zoos,
where politicians are placed in zoos,

425
00:24:11,581 --> 00:24:14,700
like antiquated things like
kids can come and look at them.

426
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:17,960
Behold Fred Grandy,
that's his name.

427
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:24,080
He's a politician. He was a congressman.
He used to be, go for Weirdos,

428
00:24:24,081 --> 00:24:28,340
man on our kind of crazy shit they did
back in those days because that then when

429
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:31,640
they did shit, they could totally
get away with everything. You know,

430
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:34,600
they just were complete freaks.
Like,

431
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,960
remember that movie about the guy from
Hogan's heroes at the fuck's his name?

432
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:42,890
The, the, the main dude wound
up killing himself. And um,

433
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,540
you don't know the movie I'm talking
about? No, it's a great movie. Um, here,

434
00:24:47,541 --> 00:24:49,850
let me look it up real quick because
it's, it's really important. It was the,

435
00:24:49,851 --> 00:24:54,020
the guy from talk soup.
John Hanson. No, no

436
00:24:55,810 --> 00:25:00,400
grey patch. Uh, uh,

437
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:05,030
the dude from love letter movies,
love letter movies. What is his name?

438
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:10,430
Kissy face movies. Fuck, I can't auto
focus. That's the movie. Greg Kinnear.

439
00:25:10,431 --> 00:25:13,620
You got it. Yeah. Pam, it's
a great fucking movie. Um,

440
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:15,980
they don't got a 6.6 on the IMD B.

441
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,250
How dare you get an excellent movie.
I know.

442
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:22,700
I didn't want to bring the
legacy of this movie auto focus.

443
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:27,410
If you haven't seen it, you must,
you must see it. It's about this guy,

444
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:29,930
whatever the fuck his name was,
Bob Crane,

445
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,900
he was a sex fiend,

446
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:36,740
like a complete the charts sex fiend.

447
00:25:36,741 --> 00:25:41,370
And he started out on the
show have married guy. And uh,

448
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:46,400
somehow or another he got so many girls
from being on Hogan's heroes that he

449
00:25:46,401 --> 00:25:49,940
just completely became out of control,
didn't take care of his career,

450
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:50,960
taking care of his family,

451
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:54,830
just with just banging chicks and
filming and all and like their stack.

452
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:56,510
Any eventually wound up getting murdered.

453
00:25:56,511 --> 00:26:00,710
And it was a very sorted thing cause
they believed that the guy who played the

454
00:26:00,711 --> 00:26:03,140
Willem defoe character was the one
who killed them. And they even,

455
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:06,110
I think they have that in the
movie as well. But either way,

456
00:26:06,111 --> 00:26:09,380
it's our great grateful.
They fucking hated each other there,

457
00:26:09,381 --> 00:26:12,530
boning together and shit. It
probably got jealous that, uh,

458
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,980
Bob Crane was getting all the Punana,
you know,

459
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:20,480
he used to sit in front of a television
at a bar when he knew that the show

460
00:26:20,481 --> 00:26:22,940
would be on so that they could see him.

461
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:24,950
They'll show was like long since canceled.

462
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:30,160
It would be on in reruns and he would be
doing like local theater like at these

463
00:26:30,321 --> 00:26:33,350
towns and he would just bang all
the local broads and filming.

464
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,470
They were freaks back then.
They didn't have any Twitter,

465
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,930
they didn't have any TMZ.
You could just go off.

466
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:41,400
You didn't have to worry about it.
If something was on a VHS tape,

467
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:44,330
I mean he's was,
the VHS was like 18 millimeter,

468
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:46,710
eight millimeter or 16
millimeter over the hell it is.

469
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:48,300
You know those little reels,

470
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:52,860
you had to play it on a projection thing
and he was like one of the first dudes

471
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:56,100
to be on top of that shit,
that technology of filming things.

472
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:00,970
And you see those naked pictures of
that girl that, that were released,

473
00:27:00,971 --> 00:27:04,100
that actress check what actress chuck.
I,

474
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,110
and she has to be in a new movie soon
because there's no way that that that's

475
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:11,650
just happens to be released. You know,
that's the big talk on the Internet too.

476
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:12,940
Let me see.
What's her name?

477
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,910
I don't know who that is, man. I've no
idea. No, she's like super famous. Yeah,

478
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,370
that girl. Super Fun. Yeah, she's a me.

479
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:24,540
I picked up the cover of one of those
us weekly things, whatever it is,

480
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:29,490
one of those inside something or other
and I didn't know who any of the people

481
00:27:29,491 --> 00:27:32,850
on it where I literally knew who
none of the celebrity don't know any

482
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:36,450
celebrities aren't like your Hansen and
I fee. I was like, I think I've won.

483
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,100
I think I won. Yeah. It's good to not
know celebrity names like in this,

484
00:27:40,101 --> 00:27:42,000
this one battle with gossip.

485
00:27:42,001 --> 00:27:46,530
I got free cause I had no attachment to
any of them and it occurred to me when I

486
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:50,220
looked at the magazine and I didn't have
any attachment. I'll be like, God damn.

487
00:27:50,221 --> 00:27:55,221
And if there was a fucking some Jennifer
Aniston broken heart because Gerard

488
00:27:56,790 --> 00:28:00,510
Butler, you know, fucking did her wrong.
I'd be like, Oh, why would that guy do?

489
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:03,360
I'd have to go read it.
I would have to go read it.

490
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:06,270
I'm invested in that storyline,
but there's like,

491
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:11,160
there was some guy on from
the Bachelorette and some
girl on from fucking orange

492
00:28:11,161 --> 00:28:15,090
county wives or something like that. I
didn't know who anybody was. I was like,

493
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,900
this is great. And they had a couple
like little teeny boppers, you know,

494
00:28:18,901 --> 00:28:22,320
and you know Joe, he breaks up with
Demi wants her back. I'm like, Oh,

495
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:24,390
who the fuck they are either.
And it occurred to me,

496
00:28:24,391 --> 00:28:28,740
while I didn't have any idea who any of
these people were, how freeing that was.

497
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:32,460
It is like a little God damn drug.

498
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:37,380
If there's some fucking crazy story about
someone who, you know their storyline,

499
00:28:37,381 --> 00:28:39,960
like tiger woods,
you know tiger woods,

500
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,870
you know a man resurfaces,

501
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:46,740
you know tiger woods apparently was
bisexual and they did that and that was on

502
00:28:46,741 --> 00:28:50,490
the cover of us weekly. That would
be like a God damn tractor beam.

503
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,200
You wouldn't be able to avoid it.

504
00:28:52,201 --> 00:28:55,560
If I sent you a link and it was
photos of tiger woods kissing a man,

505
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:00,090
you are so God damn connected to
that storyline, you would, you would,

506
00:29:00,091 --> 00:29:02,810
it would be impossible to get you
to not click that link. If you had,

507
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,770
if you had the photograph,
you'd be a millionaire.

508
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,650
If you ever had that photograph
and you put that online,

509
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,710
I guarantee you it would
be like 100% click through.

510
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,190
Like if you send people it and they know
they have this link and they click this

511
00:29:14,191 --> 00:29:16,500
link and they see tiger woods
kicking that dude click,

512
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:21,210
it'd be like 100% like no one's gonna go,
who cares? No one's going to say that.

513
00:29:21,211 --> 00:29:24,900
They're going to see people are invested
in that storyline because it's such a

514
00:29:24,901 --> 00:29:29,670
charged one. Such a big
scandal, very unattractive guy,

515
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:34,020
beautiful wife Guy, super,
super fucking successful,

516
00:29:34,021 --> 00:29:37,860
like ridiculous. Really Rich,
the greatest golfer perhaps ever,

517
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:42,010
and just fucks everyone.
Just fucks everyone.

518
00:29:42,011 --> 00:29:45,610
So it's so highly charged
that if something else
happened to it and it's like,

519
00:29:45,611 --> 00:29:47,890
well, I'm already invested
in this tiger woods story.

520
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:51,850
I can't believe he's kissing guys. You
know you would, I would be drawn to it,

521
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:55,690
but all these people, like one of them
was, you know, I don't know any of them.

522
00:29:55,691 --> 00:29:56,680
I don't know,
age people.

523
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,440
One was like a on America's got talent
or something and I don't know the fuck

524
00:29:59,441 --> 00:30:02,470
any of them were. I was like, this
is awesome. I could walk away.

525
00:30:02,471 --> 00:30:04,050
I don't have to read it.
I don't have to open this up.

526
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:07,940
Great. It's gravity man. It's like that
Shit's got gravity. It's got attention.

527
00:30:07,941 --> 00:30:08,720
Gravity.

528
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:13,720
Like some stuff in the world act does
the same thing to your attention that the

529
00:30:13,881 --> 00:30:16,010
planet does.
Dale like satellites.

530
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:20,540
It'll grab your attention and suddenly
you're circling this weird like a

531
00:30:20,541 --> 00:30:25,490
temporary vortex in the subjective
reality, the planet with your attention.

532
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,580
And it's so stupid. I mean, there's
so many things that have that example.

533
00:30:28,581 --> 00:30:33,350
Football, fucking uh, any sports is
the exact same attention. Gravity,

534
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:37,370
video games, attention, gravity,
girls' attention, gravity, mu,

535
00:30:37,371 --> 00:30:41,150
it's all like different,
quite gravitational fields that will,

536
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,860
depending on what person you're like,

537
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,950
you're going to get your attention
sucked into this certain thing.

538
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:49,910
And once it gets sucked in deep enough,
you're not thinking about anything else.

539
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:54,530
No. That's true thing when everything
shuts down except for whatever this silly

540
00:30:54,531 --> 00:30:57,670
thing is that when you're locked
in a video game, yes, that's it.

541
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:01,280
You will negate yourself if you get
stuck deep enough into a video game.

542
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:02,750
Complete introversion.
Yeah.

543
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:06,770
Do you think that it's like a hijacking
of our natural ward system by this new

544
00:31:06,771 --> 00:31:11,030
creation by it is what it
is, right? Because you know,

545
00:31:11,031 --> 00:31:14,750
I've always said that we're sort of set
up to imitate successful behavior. Right.

546
00:31:14,751 --> 00:31:17,930
But I don't think we can
differentiate 100%. You know,

547
00:31:17,931 --> 00:31:21,870
how we can't differentiate
between a placebo and, um,

548
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,710
and an actual drug in certain situations.

549
00:31:24,711 --> 00:31:29,450
Even if the person knows that something
is a placebo, they showed marked effects,

550
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:29,931
you know,

551
00:31:29,931 --> 00:31:33,260
if they're concentrating on this
actually having some sort of an effect,

552
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:35,810
it shows sort of some sort of effects.

553
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:40,080
Oh yeah, totally. I read that placebo, I
know it's, I don't understand that, but I,

554
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:42,930
I get it.
If the police CBO affects amazing.

555
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:46,020
That's why people have different
rituals. They do. What was my point?

556
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:47,890
I had a point where you get
the same effect though from me.

557
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:51,240
What do we were just talking about?
We're talking about attention, tension.

558
00:31:51,241 --> 00:31:55,140
Vampires were talking about the forces
of nature that grab your attention and

559
00:31:55,141 --> 00:31:58,440
you were saying, is that based
on a reward system? Is that like,

560
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:00,520
is it hijacking the reward system?

561
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:02,110
Right. Okay. That's what I meant.

562
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:07,710
What I meant by that is that we've
created something with like w like big

563
00:32:07,901 --> 00:32:11,260
events. Anything that you see in
your life that's memorable, the,

564
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:15,220
they're very shocking and engaging because
you need to learn from this situation.

565
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:19,600
If you could come over a hill and you
stumble upon a bunch of barbarians

566
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:21,610
slaughtering a village with axes,

567
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:24,690
this is supposed to shock
the fucking shit out of,

568
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:29,710
you're supposed to be aware that this is
all possible. This is like, oh my God,

569
00:32:29,711 --> 00:32:32,050
you could be dying right now.
You need to learn from this,

570
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:37,500
but when we recreate that in some
sort of a crazy imaginary flacked,

571
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:44,710
one dimensional or two dimensional image
with sound that comes from all around

572
00:32:45,411 --> 00:32:46,244
you,

573
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:51,400
I don't know if your brain 100% can
differentiate that from reality any more

574
00:32:52,701 --> 00:32:56,360
than a placebo has an effect on
a person. I wonder. I wonder.

575
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:58,980
You know what it is, dude,
I'm sorry to cut you off.

576
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:04,590
When you take your cat and you have one
of those like, I don't know any cat toy,

577
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:08,610
watch what it does to your cats attention.
Your cat goes from like,

578
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:10,230
if your cat gets into it enough,

579
00:33:10,231 --> 00:33:14,070
it stops being a toy and now the cats
obviously thinks it's the a bird.

580
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:18,660
It's intuit, it's in nature again and
it's stalking it's and it's attention.

581
00:33:18,661 --> 00:33:22,710
It's totally sucked into that cat toy.
That's what video games are for.

582
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:26,670
The human nervous system. They were
like, he, they're like human cat toys.

583
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:30,810
You're playing this fucking cat toy.
Your attention sucked into it in like,

584
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,990
you know people when they party,
when they portray aliens coming down,

585
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:37,440
they're going to use laser
guns to subdue us. Fuck that.

586
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:40,920
They're just going to like some super
advanced being which is analyze our

587
00:33:40,921 --> 00:33:45,240
nervous system and just like hypnotize us.
That's what it would do.

588
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:46,390
Well,
Laura,

589
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:51,140
assuming that life is going to be hard
or assuming that life isn't going to be

590
00:33:51,141 --> 00:33:53,780
like a fucking Wifi frequency,
right?

591
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:59,350
Just because we are physical and we are
hard and we touch things and move them

592
00:34:00,561 --> 00:34:04,350
and manipulate matter, it doesn't
mean all life has to do that. Do we?

593
00:34:04,351 --> 00:34:07,640
We know that bacteria doesn't do that.
We can't even fucking see it.

594
00:34:07,641 --> 00:34:08,630
We know what we need.

595
00:34:08,631 --> 00:34:12,800
Some crazy lens that magnifies our normal
reality down to the point where it's

596
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:14,780
supposed to be completely invisible to us.

597
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:17,810
Like we're not supposed to be able
to see it. Right, right. Yeah.

598
00:34:17,811 --> 00:34:20,810
We can find it and we can find
that there's some life there.

599
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:24,530
There's something there.
Intelligent life might be ideas.

600
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:26,870
Intelligent life might be creativity.

601
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:32,060
What creativity might be is when you
just relax the fuck enough to listen to

602
00:34:32,481 --> 00:34:34,670
this intelligent life
that's all around you.

603
00:34:34,671 --> 00:34:39,671
This training get you to move your
monkey body in a certain way where you're

604
00:34:39,741 --> 00:34:44,120
going to manipulate matter to the point
where you punch a fucking hole through

605
00:34:44,121 --> 00:34:48,860
space and time. And the idea of
tangible objects no longer exists.

606
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:52,280
Right? Like that's the
destiny. That's what,

607
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:56,570
that's your reason for your curiosity
as a reason why you've created music and

608
00:34:56,571 --> 00:34:58,400
motivation and cocaine.

609
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:03,320
You're supposed to be pushing towards
this inevitable goal of creating some sort

610
00:35:03,321 --> 00:35:07,420
of a fucking opening where this
thing changes into the next thing.

611
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:09,720
You know what that made me just
think of like, imagine, you know,

612
00:35:09,721 --> 00:35:12,350
like when those miners got
stuck in the mind. Yeah.

613
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:16,650
Imagine if like when they got stuck in
the mine, so I'm kind of fume came out,

614
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:21,810
they gave them complete Amnesia and so
they completely lost their identities and

615
00:35:21,811 --> 00:35:25,860
couldn't even speak any
language anymore. And so, uh,

616
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,040
they thought that that's where
they were born as this stupid mind.

617
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:34,050
And imagine the people outside the mine
would first have to teach them English,

618
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:37,050
teach them a language,
teach them who they were,

619
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:40,130
give them all this information first
before they could get trapped out of,

620
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:42,780
you know, escape from the
mind. So in the same way,

621
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:46,860
maybe this whole dimension is some kind
of Cavan and on the other side of it,

622
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,850
there's like super advanced beings that
are trying to teach us like, hey, wake up,

623
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:54,660
you know, try this, try this, try this.
You'll have to get smarter before they,

624
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:58,410
cause like if you can't tell someone
in the 18 hundreds about electricity,

625
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,380
you sure as fuck can't
tell them about the most

626
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:02,930
diverse. This is going to
sound totally crazy. All right.

627
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:08,410
But what if people are to ideas what
reconditioned laptops are two people.

628
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:14,630
And that when you get
a recondition laptop,

629
00:36:14,631 --> 00:36:17,210
you've got a laptop
that's all his hard drive,

630
00:36:17,211 --> 00:36:21,620
all the space and the operating system
and then you swipe all the data at and

631
00:36:21,621 --> 00:36:26,170
just give it to someone to add their
own stuff to completely clean. Yeah.

632
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:30,040
Like, but has this past, you know? Yeah.

633
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:33,260
And that is what it like a human is.
You come into this life,

634
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:37,790
you press the reset button,
press or re, what is that?

635
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:40,020
It's kind of like Carlos when see it.
I don't get it.

636
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:48,170
I was talking about that tweet. I have
nowhere what? Tweet? Chris Hardwick.

637
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,090
Sweet.
Oh

638
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:53,760
God damn dude, you lost me. Totally.
Yeah, of course. Hardworking.

639
00:36:53,761 --> 00:36:55,820
Brian and I had a
conversation about stitcher.

640
00:36:56,930 --> 00:37:00,770
I think are co other people see
podcasting differently than we do though.

641
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:01,641
You know,

642
00:37:01,641 --> 00:37:05,480
there's a lot of people that are trying
to monetize their podcasts and um,

643
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:06,490
you know,

644
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:08,430
when you're in the top five or top 10,
all right,

645
00:37:08,431 --> 00:37:12,370
he was breaking down 3000 listeners.
Uh,

646
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:16,260
an episode on stitcher.
3000 is how many would he,

647
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:21,220
how many people listen on stitcher and
your keys in the top four of comedy,

648
00:37:21,221 --> 00:37:25,390
iTunes rankings, right. I know the numbers
just because we did, we did this show,

649
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:26,440
I'm not gonna say the numbers,

650
00:37:26,441 --> 00:37:31,441
but I'm just going to say 3000 is not
going to affect anything in the top five.

651
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:33,800
Well, it's a, it really
depends on what you're doing.

652
00:37:33,801 --> 00:37:38,270
Some people are actually selling their
iTunes podcasts and the there building up

653
00:37:38,271 --> 00:37:41,810
towards the point where they're gonna sell
them. And then some people they, they,

654
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:43,520
there's not though.
Okay.

655
00:37:43,521 --> 00:37:48,080
But some people have advertising that's
based on their iTunes ranking. You know,

656
00:37:48,081 --> 00:37:50,480
it could be based on how
many hits you get on iTunes.

657
00:37:50,481 --> 00:37:53,900
And in that sense he's absolutely right.
Cause in that sense,

658
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:57,650
if he doesn't want to shit on stitcher
and they, I believe they pulled it off,

659
00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:01,250
he's absolutely right because
he gets paid by iTunes.

660
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:04,280
What he should be able to do is go to the
company that's sponsoring them and say,

661
00:38:04,281 --> 00:38:07,610
well, here's, there's another application
called stitcher. It's very easy to track.

662
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:11,600
Why can't we work that into it? Say
let's say, you know, I get x amount per,

663
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:16,670
you know, thousand downloads on iTunes
and then, you know, a percentage,

664
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:20,930
uh, of the downloads on stitcher. It
seems to me that it's, if it's trackable,

665
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:24,700
you should still be able to run the ads
on it. As far as I know, they don't, uh,

666
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,510
they don't do any editing of your show.

667
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:29,950
They don't do any of that. The only
thing it is, it's a banner on the APP,

668
00:38:29,951 --> 00:38:34,660
which is about one 12th of the
APP. Right. And it's like, uh,

669
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:35,980
from Hardwick's numbers that

670
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,650
he did it in a blog post,
I can't remember the exact number.

671
00:38:38,651 --> 00:38:39,610
I want to say it was uh,

672
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:44,020
800 every 800 views of that
teeny banner on that APP.

673
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:46,120
He gets a dollar,
which sucks.

674
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:51,160
But knowing what Google adsense pays
for like views of ad, it's not far off.

675
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:53,700
Well, I, I, you know some man,
he's got his own thing. He,

676
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:56,920
he likes doing it a certain way
and he should be able to, it's his,

677
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,220
it's his product. I'm, I'm agreeing
with Chris Hardwick a hundred percent.

678
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:04,370
But for us, we have a totally
different take on stitcher because I,

679
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:08,800
the podcast is, first of all, we started
off with, it wasn't supposed to be a job,

680
00:39:08,801 --> 00:39:09,550
it was a goof.

681
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:13,720
It was just me and Brian having fun and
why I wanted to do it too is just to do

682
00:39:13,721 --> 00:39:16,810
something. I thought it would be fun to
just do it and do it on a regular basis.

683
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:20,500
And people like things that are free.
It's good.

684
00:39:20,501 --> 00:39:23,590
It's good to give people free shit.
I think it's in the spirit of things,

685
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:26,350
you know? It shows that the entertainment
that you're trying to provide,

686
00:39:26,351 --> 00:39:28,990
you're really trying to provide it
for the sake of it. If you don't,

687
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:32,320
you know what I'm saying? Like you know
how he don't have any ulterior motives.

688
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:34,540
You're just doing it for the sake
you're trying to make it good.

689
00:39:34,541 --> 00:39:35,374
You're trying to make it fun.

690
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:38,170
People will respond to that and
they like it and they'll do,

691
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:41,230
they'll support you in other ways.
They'll come see your comedy show. They'll

692
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:44,780
no what, man, whatever. That's where we
did. I just say I disagree with that.

693
00:39:44,781 --> 00:39:46,970
I think it's awesome to give free content,

694
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:48,760
but I also think it's fine to charge for,

695
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,730
no, no, no. You're missing turban me.

696
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:53,500
I do not think there's anything wrong
with charging it. I just don't need to,

697
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,170
so since I don't need to, I make
it free. Right. It's that simple.

698
00:39:56,171 --> 00:39:58,240
If I needed to look like in your case,

699
00:39:58,241 --> 00:40:00,650
I know that you charged
occasionally for podcasts,

700
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:03,510
we do an extra episode a week
and charge a buck. Right.

701
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:06,940
And this has been like a a source of
controversy and some fucking dummy on my

702
00:40:06,941 --> 00:40:10,150
message board wrote some whole thing
about how he's upset at you because you

703
00:40:10,151 --> 00:40:14,680
charge for a podcast and all that.
I fucking pay, you know, listen,

704
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,610
no one is telling you you will have to
pay and in fact Dunkin is actually giving

705
00:40:18,611 --> 00:40:20,260
you something for free still.

706
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:23,890
He does an extra one a week and then
the extra one he wants to see if he can

707
00:40:23,891 --> 00:40:27,630
make some money. We know what's
particularly to me, what's gross man,

708
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,340
people are gross.

709
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:31,100
But I think it's a, it's,
it's, it's, I know it's, I,

710
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,680
that's what I thought originally, but then
when I started thinking about it more,

711
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:37,940
I realized that it uncovers this certain
layer of conditioning that exists in

712
00:40:37,941 --> 00:40:42,941
people because like when you go to the
ATM and the ATM asks you for two Bucks or

713
00:40:43,401 --> 00:40:46,760
whatever to get cash out because you're
not at your bank, you're just like, ah,

714
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:47,653
fuck it.

715
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:52,370
Do it when you're at the gas station
and it's like 35 cents convenience fee.

716
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:55,490
I don't even know what that fucking means,
but I'll pay it.

717
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:58,360
But the moment artists
start saying, hey, I,

718
00:40:58,361 --> 00:41:02,360
I like to make money for this
stuff I'm making. People are like,

719
00:41:02,361 --> 00:41:06,560
what the fuck you're gonna charge
for that Shit. They, but if

720
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:09,790
I see you're getting it for free, you
mean? Well, they're getting it for free.

721
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:11,350
If you start charging from the beginning,

722
00:41:11,351 --> 00:41:14,170
people have no problem with continued
to pay for things. Yeah, yeah. It's,

723
00:41:14,171 --> 00:41:15,580
once they start getting it for free,

724
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:19,100
that's all. We added an extra episode
and experiment totally worked.

725
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:23,030
And it made me think, you
know, this is a model.

726
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,670
Maybe this is a new model
that other people can use.

727
00:41:25,671 --> 00:41:28,550
It's like instead of pulling the rug
out from people's feet and saying,

728
00:41:28,551 --> 00:41:30,920
you're paying now I'm
charging for everything.

729
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:36,130
You always offer some free thing for
people to enjoy and then you add one extra

730
00:41:36,921 --> 00:41:40,190
thing to. It's if people are really
into it and don't mind paying.

731
00:41:40,191 --> 00:41:44,860
Most people send us emails saying they
like supporting the show. They like it.

732
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:45,820
Well,
most people do.

733
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:48,840
The reason why people get upset
is the reason why people there.

734
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:53,110
There's people that find something
anywhere to get angry at and it's because

735
00:41:53,111 --> 00:41:56,950
they're looking for it. They're
looking for something to piss them off.

736
00:41:57,130 --> 00:42:02,130
And if you're angry at some guy whose
podcast you like because he would like a

737
00:42:02,231 --> 00:42:06,000
dollar for an hour and a half's
worth of, uh, him talking,

738
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,560
I understand what you don't. If
you don't have a buck, like, look,

739
00:42:08,561 --> 00:42:09,670
I've been there before,
man.

740
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:12,790
I've been to points in my life where I
rolled pennies so I'd have something to

741
00:42:12,791 --> 00:42:17,140
eat for dinner. I understand poverty.
I've, I've been there for a long time.

742
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:19,150
I totally get that.
You don't have to buy it,

743
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:22,300
but you have to be fucking mad that
he's selling it. And by the blessing,

744
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,390
when someone's giving you something

745
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:28,420
for free, and also, by the way, how about
you email me and ask for the fucking MP3?

746
00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:31,000
There's like a 99% chance.
I probably wouldn't

747
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:31,890
just send it to you.

748
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:36,200
Just fucked up and said on the Internet
was the one time I would have done unto

749
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:40,620
email. Never do it again.
Okay, well, whatever.

750
00:42:40,621 --> 00:42:43,920
Trolled by a hot chick,
right? It's really a dude. Ah,

751
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:48,210
that will be tearing at whatever height
you fucked up. You open up the gates,

752
00:42:48,211 --> 00:42:48,751
you challenged.

753
00:42:48,751 --> 00:42:53,040
There's all this time he challenged the
hackers in the world right there to what?

754
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:58,030
To a duel. I do not just mentoring.
I know you said you were,

755
00:42:59,130 --> 00:43:00,990
you said you were respond to email.

756
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:04,800
You saying you respond to emails is
like opening up the gates to hell sure.

757
00:43:04,801 --> 00:43:07,380
That someone's going to go,
okay, how do I get this one?

758
00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:08,490
The fuck could it looks stupid.

759
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:12,270
Oh No. Next game. Now I'm paranoid.

760
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:16,500
Now we got to exist in like a Philip k
Dick Universe with like being terrified

761
00:43:16,501 --> 00:43:19,470
of people who email me. I do.
You know what, by the way,

762
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:23,370
people already know I respond to shit
cause I talked to people on Facebook and

763
00:43:23,730 --> 00:43:28,730
you do on occasion get some emails from
people that it really seems like these

764
00:43:28,771 --> 00:43:32,730
are cops. You know what I mean? For sure.
I got an email from somebody who's like,

765
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:35,340
hi me and my buds.

766
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:39,390
We're thinking of taking some magic
mushrooms and we're wondering if you could

767
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:42,210
tell us where to get them or
could send us some in the mail.

768
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:47,330
But it was like the slang they
were using was like, like sides.

769
00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:51,890
But yeah it was weird.
Obviously worse. First of all,

770
00:43:51,891 --> 00:43:55,170
you hippie ever. Even if it was serious
like I'm going to be like, oh sure

771
00:43:55,460 --> 00:44:00,260
his mail you an illegal substance is
really hilarious. Yeah, it's very,

772
00:44:00,261 --> 00:44:03,380
it's very spooky. I had a guy wanted
to get DMT from me and Cleveland.

773
00:44:03,381 --> 00:44:07,550
I knew he was a cop cause the first of
all, who the fuck is asking me for DMT,

774
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:11,870
Cleveland and Cleveland. I mean
Cleveland and this guy is a crew cut.

775
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:15,140
He's looking at me and I'm like, this
guy isn't this rock. He's not high.

776
00:44:15,141 --> 00:44:18,500
And you know, you know, I'm assessing a
dude, I'm looking at this guy. I'm like,

777
00:44:18,501 --> 00:44:21,830
this guy seems like he's had some
self defense training. Right?

778
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:25,580
It seems like he's a confident man. It
seems like he's in a, he's acting what?

779
00:44:25,581 --> 00:44:30,350
He's got some weird like um,
feeling of authority about him.

780
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,540
I was like, he's almost
like, he expects authority.

781
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:36,230
He expects you to like this guy
was like such an obvious cause.

782
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:40,030
Ridiculous because a bad cop or
at least a dumb cop, they get a,

783
00:44:40,031 --> 00:44:43,170
a feeling of entitlement around
people. You know, a dumb one.

784
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:47,100
I've seen it a bunch of times and I'm a
big supporter of cops and I always say

785
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:50,490
that the 99% of cops are
just trying to do a good job.

786
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:53,850
It's the 1% of cons that fuck it
up for everybody else. You know,

787
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:56,790
they run a pretty fucking tight
ship and most police for sure,

788
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:00,630
but this guy just eat of cop. I was
like, what are you talking about man?

789
00:45:00,810 --> 00:45:03,390
And he goes, he goes, he
goes, come on man, DMT.

790
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:06,090
He's like looking at me and I'm looking
at him, we're making eye contact.

791
00:45:06,091 --> 00:45:09,990
I'm like, motherfucker, the last thing you
want is DMT. You're not looking for DMT.

792
00:45:09,991 --> 00:45:11,010
You fucking Weirdo.

793
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:13,510
Yeah. You know and I,
and I was like, I said

794
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:17,680
weirdest stare off man.
It was so strange.

795
00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:20,440
I think associate cause cause
he was totally full of Shit.

796
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,640
There was no way this guy was looking
at trip. He wasn't looking at Trevor,

797
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:24,720
he was looking to fucking arrest me.

798
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:28,660
You're not know that marijuana thing
that John Have Ron gave you? Yeah.

799
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:30,020
Ever since that show,

800
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:34,310
every day this guy rob writes to me
and he adds an extra hundred dollars.

801
00:45:34,311 --> 00:45:37,700
He goes a hundred dollar donation. If you
send me one of those marijuana sticks,

802
00:45:38,390 --> 00:45:41,940
$200 donation, he's done it every
day. I think I'm up to $500 a month.

803
00:45:42,310 --> 00:45:46,250
That's just to tell him to suck your
cock on video. Do An internet search.

804
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:50,450
Why Tracy didn't tell him about Google.
Yeah. Well, you can't get that shit on.

805
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:55,780
You can't get a vapor I oh really? Yeah.
Yeah. Those, these are California. Oh. Oh,

806
00:45:55,790 --> 00:45:58,290
I see. I didn't, or maybe
probably Colorado's rockets.

807
00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:01,580
They're thinking about closing
the post office. Yeah, man.

808
00:46:01,581 --> 00:46:04,700
I'm tired of getting mail. Yes, me too.
Me Too. I never get good. How about,

809
00:46:04,701 --> 00:46:06,650
how about we make it so that,
just like our answers,

810
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:09,300
Sasha, we get to the point where
nothing we have is traceable.

811
00:46:09,301 --> 00:46:11,190
Once the big bang happens,
right.

812
00:46:11,191 --> 00:46:13,410
Fucking rock hits the planet
and all our fucking, yeah.

813
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:17,060
Yeah. All our hardware corrodes. We
have nothing solid written anywhere.

814
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:21,890
How about no post office and only
quarters do you mean only quarters doll or

815
00:46:21,891 --> 00:46:25,490
money? Dollar bills and stuff
like that. Paper money, but
only quarters. No pennies.

816
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:29,370
Nickels and dimes. Everything
really. Recording. Stopped
doing the, no, I mean, what,

817
00:46:29,371 --> 00:46:33,470
what? Did that make sense? I mean,
that'd be a good idea. Oh Jesus. Dude.

818
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:34,910
Everything in quarters. Yeah. I mean,

819
00:46:34,911 --> 00:46:38,570
how many knowing it seems like it would
be a nice excuse for them to raise taxes

820
00:46:38,571 --> 00:46:41,480
so that everything runs off
to a quarter. Yeah. Yeah.

821
00:46:41,481 --> 00:46:42,590
No matter what it rounds off to.

822
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:45,500
The next quarter always raises high
and all that goes to the government.

823
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:49,310
That's not a good move. What are
you doing? What of those fuck heads?

824
00:46:49,311 --> 00:46:52,310
More money had been watching
these republican debates. Yeah.

825
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:55,040
Did you see the one where
they were talking about the
guy dying cause he didn't

826
00:46:55,041 --> 00:46:56,900
have any money and didn't
have any insurance.

827
00:46:57,170 --> 00:46:59,060
She die and the audience was cheering.

828
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:00,453
Yeah.

829
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:01,750
Tell me about that.
What is,

830
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:03,000
well I'll tell you what it is.

831
00:47:03,001 --> 00:47:08,001
The tea party is hilarious because the
moment you climb out of the pussy it's

832
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:11,280
open game. But when you're in
there and no one can touch you,

833
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:12,690
they're all anti abortion.

834
00:47:12,691 --> 00:47:16,020
But the moment you're born there like
let him die and I'd like you could have a

835
00:47:16,021 --> 00:47:20,190
baby that pops out and doesn't
have insurance inside the fetus.

836
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:24,060
If the woman wanted to get inside the
womb, if the woman wanted an abortion,

837
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:28,200
the tea party be like, no, it's
evil. The moment that baby comes out,

838
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:30,430
if it doesn't have insurance,
tea parties

839
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:34,860
let it die. It's Mama didn't
have insurance, let it die.

840
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:36,640
I don't think they feel
that way about babies,

841
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:40,540
what they feel like grown ups on it. But
growing up, growing up, you're on your

842
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:42,570
gramma grownups,
which is mutated babies.

843
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:46,540
Well, their babies that grew up there,
but I don't think they're anti baby.

844
00:47:46,541 --> 00:47:48,580
I think they're just,
when you get to a certain point,

845
00:47:48,581 --> 00:47:50,230
you're supposed to take
personal responsibility.

846
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:53,140
I think the way they're going
about it is pretty silly. I mean,

847
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:58,160
the idea should be that you should have
a sense of community that is earned

848
00:47:58,570 --> 00:48:02,230
where everyone contributes. So
everyone wants to help everyone. Sure.

849
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:06,730
Our real problem is that there's too
many fucking people and that you cannot

850
00:48:06,731 --> 00:48:08,960
have communities of 20 million people,
right?

851
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:11,890
Because you're going to get a
diffusion of responsibility.

852
00:48:12,070 --> 00:48:14,710
You're going to get a situation where
there's too many fucking people and

853
00:48:14,711 --> 00:48:19,210
they're not going to care about one life
here or one live there and one person

854
00:48:19,211 --> 00:48:21,340
here, one person there.
They don't have to.

855
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:23,920
But if you lived in a
village of 50 people,

856
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:26,620
everyone want to have to care about
everyone and that's how we're supposed to

857
00:48:26,621 --> 00:48:30,400
live. We're supposed to live like in the
movie Little Red Riding Hood where the,

858
00:48:30,401 --> 00:48:33,220
there's a girl with a bug eyes.
It's really hot. What's that chick?

859
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:37,510
She's blonde flogger who cares?
I don't care what it is very hot.

860
00:48:37,511 --> 00:48:39,460
She's in a lot of movies and um,

861
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:42,340
she was in Little Red Riding Hood and
they played this little village where

862
00:48:42,341 --> 00:48:44,560
there was a werewolf that
came was fucking everybody up.

863
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:48,940
I have to see all werewolf mode across
even a little red riding hood. But uh,

864
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:53,400
she lives in this little village and as
well as watching all these people sort

865
00:48:53,401 --> 00:48:56,210
of prepare their town and
you know, and, and you know,

866
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:59,920
stockpile everything and prepare
for this werewolf. I was like,

867
00:48:59,921 --> 00:49:02,280
this is how people really
are supposed to live there.

868
00:49:02,281 --> 00:49:07,060
Some supposed to live in small communities
that are worried about outsiders.

869
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:08,980
That's how they're supposed to live.
He supposed to be.

870
00:49:08,981 --> 00:49:13,210
Everybody that you know in this
little area is your friend.

871
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:16,720
You're all cool, you're cool together,
you work together, you eat together,

872
00:49:16,721 --> 00:49:20,350
you hunt together, you cook together.
Everyone is in this little group.

873
00:49:21,090 --> 00:49:23,230
The people that you don't
know that come over the hill,

874
00:49:23,231 --> 00:49:24,400
those are the ones you
have to worry about.

875
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:27,370
I don't think people are supposed
to live in any particular way.

876
00:49:27,371 --> 00:49:32,020
I think that there's bears, you know,
that's what adaptations all about. Sure.

877
00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:34,210
So I think that the,
you know,

878
00:49:35,230 --> 00:49:39,310
now that the real problem isn't that, you
know, people are sucking the system dry.

879
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:42,110
The right,
the real problem is really quite clear.

880
00:49:42,111 --> 00:49:44,710
It just seems like it's right
in front of everyone. Diabetes,

881
00:49:44,711 --> 00:49:48,580
it's that 2% of the people on
the planet have all the wealth.

882
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:50,830
And that's,
that's the problem.

883
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:53,700
That is,
that is part of the problem.

884
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:57,840
But the other part of the problem
is that the biological evolution,

885
00:49:57,841 --> 00:50:02,841
the evolution of the animal to human
animal itself to adapt to this system of

886
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:08,540
this community being intensely like
incredibly larger than it used to be.

887
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:14,250
That our DNA and our,

888
00:50:14,310 --> 00:50:19,310
the way we think and behave and it's
based on communities and when all of a

889
00:50:20,191 --> 00:50:23,790
sudden the community is some abstract
number that you can't even wrap your head

890
00:50:23,791 --> 00:50:28,070
around a community of 300 million
people. Well, that's the only

891
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:32,690
reason why we can except states. And you
know, if we just had one giant state,

892
00:50:32,691 --> 00:50:35,720
it would be so completely
ridiculous. You know, it would be,

893
00:50:35,721 --> 00:50:37,040
it would seem so strange.

894
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:40,700
World. The order or like a global, yes.

895
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:40,961
No,

896
00:50:40,961 --> 00:50:44,140
I mean the idea of a giant community of
bunch of people you don't even fucking

897
00:50:44,141 --> 00:50:47,950
know of a, not in a number that's so
large. You can't wrap your head around.

898
00:50:47,951 --> 00:50:49,490
We don't know what 300 million means.

899
00:50:49,810 --> 00:50:52,450
300 million is just some
numbers on a piece of paper.

900
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:55,660
No one's brain registers
with 300 million people is,

901
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:59,380
but that's the community that we're
involved in. Somehow or another,

902
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:04,060
the world has grown to the point where
300 million people plus the whole rest of

903
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:08,200
the world is constantly
communicating at the exact same time,

904
00:51:08,350 --> 00:51:12,730
which is something the biological body
of today, it's absolutely not ready for.

905
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:17,440
So all of our checks and balances and
natural reward systems are completely

906
00:51:17,441 --> 00:51:22,000
fucking hijacked. Just like
they're hijacked with movies
that fucking trick us.

907
00:51:22,270 --> 00:51:24,280
Just like their hijack with placebos,

908
00:51:24,281 --> 00:51:29,281
just like the whole system is hijacked
and we have just have not caught up to

909
00:51:29,891 --> 00:51:30,970
how much life has changed,

910
00:51:31,170 --> 00:51:33,930
not catching up and and a
big reason it is not right

911
00:51:33,970 --> 00:51:37,000
catching it is,
but slowly it's the,

912
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:39,110
it takes longer than the thing.

913
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:43,720
Well that's because the people who are
in control of the system are the 2% who

914
00:51:43,721 --> 00:51:46,090
have all the money.
That's the fucking problem.

915
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:49,950
But isn't that why the system has gotten
this big this fast and the first place?

916
00:51:50,230 --> 00:51:53,600
It's almost like you need greed tents.

917
00:51:53,770 --> 00:51:58,770
You need a greed and intense ambition
and all these things in some form

918
00:51:58,950 --> 00:52:02,950
ultimately lead to monarchies
ultimately lead to bad things.

919
00:52:03,070 --> 00:52:07,420
It's like they get so intense that a
person is so competitive about money that

920
00:52:07,421 --> 00:52:09,790
they get to the point where they have
way more money than they can use and

921
00:52:09,791 --> 00:52:11,050
they're fucking over
the rest of the world,

922
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:13,600
but they can't even help themselves
because it's like an ethic,

923
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:18,930
always an explanation for tyranny.
There's always an explanation like that.

924
00:52:19,050 --> 00:52:20,640
You can almost always tell there's an x.

925
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:25,500
There's like there's the
current explanation is these
people the not what you're

926
00:52:25,501 --> 00:52:29,130
saying because what you're saying is
is is is smart, but the, the, the,

927
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:34,140
the base version is these 2% of the
wealthy have earned their money and they

928
00:52:35,461 --> 00:52:39,690
deserve to keep it in everyone else.
They're lazy fucks.

929
00:52:39,810 --> 00:52:41,430
That's the idea.
They're just not lucky.

930
00:52:41,431 --> 00:52:45,240
They just didn't put their
shoulders to the grind stone.

931
00:52:45,330 --> 00:52:48,900
They didn't push hard enough and
so that's the, that's the idea.

932
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:52,770
Now I think the real truth of the
matter is that many of these people have

933
00:52:52,771 --> 00:52:55,230
inherited their money.
Many of these people,

934
00:52:55,290 --> 00:52:58,560
they didn't necessarily earn their money
and even if they did earn the fucking

935
00:52:58,561 --> 00:52:59,190
money,

936
00:52:59,190 --> 00:53:04,170
the fact that there are people
in the world with big fat,

937
00:53:04,171 --> 00:53:08,460
bloated fucking bellies cause they're
starving to death in Somali and we can't

938
00:53:08,461 --> 00:53:12,690
get the resources there because some
of fundamentalists fucking Islamic

939
00:53:12,691 --> 00:53:17,130
organization what the Shit through
so that fucking babies can eat.

940
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,050
The fact that we're
totally cool with that,

941
00:53:19,051 --> 00:53:24,051
while simultaneously every bomb we
drop costs $100,000 on top of Libya.

942
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:28,200
The fact that we're totally cool with
that is an indication to me not have a

943
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:30,000
nervous system not catching up,

944
00:53:30,001 --> 00:53:33,990
but a state of people not being
educated appropriately and ethics.

945
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:35,610
It seems like a simple thing.

946
00:53:35,611 --> 00:53:39,480
We need to fucking t school teachers
need to start getting paid that doctors

947
00:53:39,481 --> 00:53:43,380
wage school teachers need to start getting
paid the same amount of celebrities

948
00:53:43,381 --> 00:53:47,970
get paid so that it becomes a competitive
industry and only the super smart are

949
00:53:47,971 --> 00:53:51,390
the ones who start giving our
children like the basic information.

950
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:55,090
You're absolutely right and on that
platform you should run for president.

951
00:53:55,091 --> 00:53:55,720
But my,

952
00:53:55,720 --> 00:54:00,720
my point is not a attached to the
human animal as one of its own.

953
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:04,750
My point is looking at it objectively.
When I look at it objectively,

954
00:54:04,751 --> 00:54:05,680
when I look at the,

955
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:10,710
the way human beings are so intensely
focused on wealth and so intensely focused

956
00:54:12,311 --> 00:54:16,360
on privilege and of uh, on, on,
conquering and taking over things,

957
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:21,960
I really think that it's like a queen
bee or like any sort of a natural,

958
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:23,680
you know,

959
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:28,680
a large leader of an ant colony
or whatever the fuck it is there.

960
00:54:28,961 --> 00:54:33,961
There's some crazy thing that people
need in order to accomplish what we are

961
00:54:34,781 --> 00:54:38,710
abstract, abstractly, aware
of trying to accomplish.

962
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:43,660
And it goes back to this technology thing.
You, when you, when you have ambition,

963
00:54:43,661 --> 00:54:46,750
any kind of ambition, you're going to have
competition. When you have competition,

964
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:48,940
you're always going to have people
that take it to the next level.

965
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:50,560
And some people,
you know,

966
00:54:50,561 --> 00:54:53,290
take it to the next level like Michael
Jordan does on the basketball court.

967
00:54:53,410 --> 00:54:54,280
Or you know,

968
00:54:54,281 --> 00:54:58,150
you've got guys like William Randolph
Hearst who takes it to that next level

969
00:54:58,151 --> 00:55:02,380
when he was running newspapers. He's
just a fucking dominator. Fuck you.

970
00:55:02,381 --> 00:55:05,950
I don't give a shit. How about I make
up stories and put them on my newspaper?

971
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:07,020
You fuck head.

972
00:55:07,190 --> 00:55:09,700
And then I'm going to kill you and I'm
going to make up a story and put it in my

973
00:55:09,701 --> 00:55:12,640
paper that says you were in the
Kiddie porn. You fuckhead I mean,

974
00:55:12,641 --> 00:55:15,850
William Randolph Hearst got
to some insane point of power,

975
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:20,920
but I almost wonder if instead of looking
at these individual circumstances are

976
00:55:20,921 --> 00:55:21,950
individual,
uh,

977
00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:27,100
people that create horrible things and
greed and an obscenely wealthy people

978
00:55:27,101 --> 00:55:29,290
while other people are starving.
Instead of looking at that,

979
00:55:29,530 --> 00:55:33,460
I always look at the mechanism itself.
Look at the movement itself.

980
00:55:33,461 --> 00:55:38,110
Which way is the wave going and
why, why, why is it going in the,

981
00:55:38,111 --> 00:55:43,060
the most supposedly progressive of
all the countries being America,

982
00:55:43,210 --> 00:55:48,210
the most hyper aggressive about
controlling natural resources and about

983
00:55:48,251 --> 00:55:52,780
innovation and have about weapons,
about weapons and about science.

984
00:55:52,870 --> 00:55:56,210
And today NASA announced that
we're going to try to go to Mars,

985
00:55:56,211 --> 00:55:59,680
so going to have manned missions to
Mars, a giant fucking thing, like,

986
00:55:59,710 --> 00:56:01,720
like the Saturn five rocket on steroids.

987
00:56:01,721 --> 00:56:05,190
They're going to send astronauts to
Mars. And you know, this keeps American.

988
00:56:05,191 --> 00:56:06,670
This is one of the big
points of their point.

989
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:09,750
The keeps America in the
leader in this space race.

990
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,170
People are worried that we're losing the
space race because we can no longer put

991
00:56:14,171 --> 00:56:17,440
people in the, the, the space station.
We have to rely on the Soviets.

992
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:20,110
And the Soviets just crashed one
of their shuttles the other day.

993
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:25,280
So now we're like, um, you guys, did
you change the oil? What are you doing?

994
00:56:25,310 --> 00:56:27,880
We don't even know what they
did were hopping on their plane.

995
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:31,800
You know, that we still have space racist.
That's like the last Olympics. You know,

996
00:56:31,810 --> 00:56:33,590
this is like the dumbest
thing that were in these,

997
00:56:33,591 --> 00:56:37,410
the Olympics with other countries that
we got to go farther, faster first.

998
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:42,370
Yeah. But no, because it pushes innovation
and it pushes people to really, I mean,

999
00:56:42,371 --> 00:56:43,990
whether or not you believe
people will end up on the moon.

1000
00:56:44,050 --> 00:56:47,420
I know it sounds retarded. I was 12
questions. Um, and people go, well put,

1001
00:56:47,490 --> 00:56:48,660
I got answers.
You know,

1002
00:56:48,670 --> 00:56:51,970
there's like this recent photographs
of the moon landing and everybody sends

1003
00:56:51,971 --> 00:56:53,950
them to me and they're like, what do
you think, man? What do you think?

1004
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:58,060
And I think if I was guilty of something.
Okay,

1005
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:01,840
and I sent you a picture that showed
that I wasn't guilty or something and it

1006
00:57:01,841 --> 00:57:05,290
was really fucking blurry and it looks
like it was taken from a million miles

1007
00:57:05,291 --> 00:57:08,780
away and black and white.
Would you believe me? No. Oh,

1008
00:57:08,781 --> 00:57:12,400
I'm sure that this is a satellite photo.
It's very likely that it is.

1009
00:57:12,850 --> 00:57:17,790
I leave open the possibility that it's
not and people say that's crazy and I

1010
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:19,270
probably is.

1011
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:22,110
Is that possibility 1% or how?
How big it?

1012
00:57:22,430 --> 00:57:25,910
I have no idea. Then I would know because
they look, this is what I would say.

1013
00:57:25,911 --> 00:57:30,911
I would say if it's 99% if there's 1%
why was that 1% therefore what the fuck

1014
00:57:31,791 --> 00:57:35,420
did therefore it's 99% means I really
believe it. I just see leave it open.

1015
00:57:35,421 --> 00:57:37,190
I don't have a percentage labeled on it.

1016
00:57:37,790 --> 00:57:40,730
I think the people in the 60s
and the 70s were full of shit.

1017
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:42,980
I think the government was
intensely full of Shit.

1018
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:48,100
I think the Nixon Nixon had
wrenched administration was
deceptive as a practice,

1019
00:57:49,070 --> 00:57:50,870
generally across the board,

1020
00:57:50,871 --> 00:57:55,580
completely full of Shit and without
accountability until they got busted in

1021
00:57:55,581 --> 00:57:59,900
Watergate and the shit that
went on in the Vietnam War.

1022
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:03,260
How they got into the Vietnam War
from the Gulf of Tonkin incident,

1023
00:58:03,261 --> 00:58:04,330
which was a big fat fuck

1024
00:58:04,410 --> 00:58:07,010
can lie. Do you think the government
would have learned by now like, Hey,

1025
00:58:07,011 --> 00:58:10,460
we're getting into some harder age. Hold
on. We're not going to lie. I don't know.

1026
00:58:10,461 --> 00:58:11,294
I don't know

1027
00:58:12,070 --> 00:58:13,840
cause they still do shit that's fucked up.

1028
00:58:13,890 --> 00:58:15,970
Who get the Pamela smart
or not Pamela smart case.

1029
00:58:16,270 --> 00:58:20,740
The girl who got the girl who got rescued
in Iraq. What the fuck is her name?

1030
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:22,690
The Fun on polling
anybody's names out today,

1031
00:58:22,691 --> 00:58:26,470
but the point was this girl with
Jessica Lynch, she was in the hospital.

1032
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:28,360
They said there was a gun fight.
She was kidnapped,

1033
00:58:28,361 --> 00:58:31,270
they had a rescue or they're brought it
back. She was an American hero. Well,

1034
00:58:31,271 --> 00:58:34,300
it turns out she was not in a gun fight
at all. She was in a fucking hospital.

1035
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:35,740
There was no guns fire.

1036
00:58:35,770 --> 00:58:38,020
They went in and got her and
they made up a god damn story.

1037
00:58:38,110 --> 00:58:41,950
The Pat Tillman story. Pat Tillman
died because of fucking friendly fire.

1038
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:46,840
Someone made a mistake and he died, you
know? But when they put that story out,

1039
00:58:46,841 --> 00:58:49,030
they did not say that.
When they put that story out,

1040
00:58:49,031 --> 00:58:51,900
they said he died in defense of our
country. Meanwhile, Pat Tillman,

1041
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:53,680
when he was over there,
was a huge,

1042
00:58:53,890 --> 00:58:58,240
he went from being a huge supporter of
the war to going over there and openly

1043
00:58:58,241 --> 00:59:02,350
criticizing and saying was a gigantic
cluster fuck of epic proportions.

1044
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:06,520
And his brother's still maintains that
to this day. So they lie about shit.

1045
00:59:06,521 --> 00:59:07,420
They make shit up.

1046
00:59:07,450 --> 00:59:10,930
But I don't know whether or not
they've made up landing on the moon.

1047
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:14,860
I don't know whether or not they killed
Kennedy. I don't know. I leave those open.

1048
00:59:14,890 --> 00:59:18,760
I leave those open because I think it's
very possible. It's, there's nothing,

1049
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:20,860
there's etched in stone shit to me.

1050
00:59:20,870 --> 00:59:23,300
Here's something etched
in stone edged in stone.

1051
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:26,450
There was a man named Kennedy shot and
cats. Right? That's actually the stone.

1052
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,730
I don't know what the fuck
happened to him. I don't know.

1053
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:33,320
It's fascinating to me the whole idea
of this bullet magically showing up on

1054
00:59:33,321 --> 00:59:36,860
governor Connolly's Gurney, they bring
them in. Oh, I think we found the bullet.

1055
00:59:37,190 --> 00:59:39,980
This bullet didn't look like he gets
shot through anything. It's ridiculous.

1056
00:59:39,981 --> 00:59:43,280
There's more fragments of metal supposedly
in their bodies that are missing from

1057
00:59:43,281 --> 00:59:45,320
this bullet. You know,
attribute that to what you will,

1058
00:59:45,321 --> 00:59:48,380
but the idea that you could shoot a
bullet through fucking bone and no one's

1059
00:59:48,381 --> 00:59:49,640
ever been able to recreate that.

1060
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:52,430
They tried that in one of those fucking
shows and the only way their ability to

1061
00:59:52,431 --> 00:59:55,220
make it look anything
even close to that bullet,

1062
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:58,310
they had to shoot it through like gelatin
that it's treated through like fake

1063
00:59:58,311 --> 01:00:00,080
skin that's supposed to replicate gelatin.

1064
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:02,240
But as soon as you hit a
bone that's a rap song.

1065
01:00:02,241 --> 01:00:05,300
That bullet was warped and fucked up.
That's what happens to bill. It's man,

1066
01:00:05,301 --> 01:00:06,410
it's supposed to be like that.

1067
01:00:06,530 --> 01:00:09,800
They fragment inside your body and they
create more damage. They shatter things.

1068
01:00:09,801 --> 01:00:12,530
They're led with a shield
on them of of another metal,

1069
01:00:12,531 --> 01:00:14,080
like brass or something like that.
And when they,

1070
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:17,270
depending on what you have and they
hit things, they fuck up, they bend up.

1071
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:19,760
That Kennedy bullet
didn't go through shit.

1072
01:00:19,761 --> 01:00:22,820
They shot that thing into a fucking
fish tank. The thing we like,

1073
01:00:22,821 --> 01:00:25,190
it never had anything like
it hit a million pillows,

1074
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:28,610
didn't look like in fucking hitting
anything hard like a bone and shattered

1075
01:00:28,611 --> 01:00:32,060
someone's wrist. I don't buy that for a
God damn second. And if you do buy that,

1076
01:00:32,061 --> 01:00:34,400
you're looking for that to be the answer.
You know?

1077
01:00:34,401 --> 01:00:37,760
And the only reason why they
ever even said, you know,

1078
01:00:37,761 --> 01:00:40,920
people dispute the positioning of the
magic bullet, the positioning look.

1079
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:41,451
But you know,

1080
01:00:41,451 --> 01:00:44,120
Anthony Bordain had a really good point
when you talked about people that get

1081
01:00:44,121 --> 01:00:45,530
shot when he was on our podcast.

1082
01:00:45,530 --> 01:00:48,680
Talk about some people get shot and the
bullet ricochets inside their head and

1083
01:00:48,681 --> 01:00:51,920
exits out the back and doesn't even
do any damage. It was totally true.

1084
01:00:52,010 --> 01:00:55,580
Crazy things can happen when
you're shooting bullets for people.

1085
01:00:55,581 --> 01:00:57,890
People have been shot through the
head and nothing happens to them.

1086
01:00:58,010 --> 01:00:59,660
Literally shot through the fucking head.

1087
01:00:59,661 --> 01:01:02,180
They have a hole straight through their
head and they live and they don't have

1088
01:01:02,181 --> 01:01:05,590
any functioning, you know, they're,
they're allowed to walk around there.

1089
01:01:05,591 --> 01:01:08,480
They're fine. They can rehab.
It's amazing. Some people know,

1090
01:01:08,570 --> 01:01:11,420
but every time you shoot
a bullet into something,

1091
01:01:11,421 --> 01:01:15,020
that bullet gets fucked up every time,
every time.

1092
01:01:15,820 --> 01:01:17,930
And that bull,
if you look at that bullet,

1093
01:01:17,931 --> 01:01:21,890
it's so clear that bullet didn't hit
anything. There's no fucking way.

1094
01:01:22,010 --> 01:01:24,440
It went through two different people.
There's no way.

1095
01:01:24,530 --> 01:01:27,890
And the only reason why they even had
to say it went through to people is

1096
01:01:27,891 --> 01:01:32,891
because we had to attribute three bullets
to one person because they found a guy

1097
01:01:33,291 --> 01:01:36,740
who was under the underpass who was
hit with a ricochet. When that guy,

1098
01:01:36,741 --> 01:01:39,530
when it hit the curb, the ricochet
of the granite came up, hit this guy,

1099
01:01:39,531 --> 01:01:42,140
fucked him up. He had to go to
the hospital. What happened?

1100
01:01:42,170 --> 01:01:45,920
I got hit with a ricochet. They've found
the spot on the concrete or the, uh, the,

1101
01:01:45,921 --> 01:01:47,780
the granite,
the whatever.

1102
01:01:47,781 --> 01:01:50,120
There's the curbs don't where
it had been hit by the bullet.

1103
01:01:50,180 --> 01:01:52,520
So they knew he was telling the truth
though. Here's a bullet hole, okay?

1104
01:01:52,521 --> 01:01:56,720
This is where the guy got hit. So they
had to that. Now they have three wounds.

1105
01:01:56,750 --> 01:02:00,110
Now they have all these shots and they
don't, or two, I guess two wounds.

1106
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:02,630
And they had to attribute one of them,

1107
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:05,690
two to one in two different
people's bodies to the same bullet.

1108
01:02:06,050 --> 01:02:08,780
It's completely unscientific.
Instead of saying, what are the,

1109
01:02:08,781 --> 01:02:11,720
what is the possibility that even though
we caught Lee Harvey Oswald would,

1110
01:02:11,721 --> 01:02:15,680
if there was a guy on the roof above him,
what if there was a, is that possible?

1111
01:02:15,710 --> 01:02:20,190
And No, no, no, no, no. Impossible.
Is it pos? No. Nothing possible.

1112
01:02:20,191 --> 01:02:21,960
Let's talk to this guy and find,
oh,

1113
01:02:21,961 --> 01:02:26,961
this fucking mob collected guy or mob
connected guy ran up to him and shot him

1114
01:02:27,121 --> 01:02:31,440
in broad daylight, in the stomach, in
front of everybody and police officers.

1115
01:02:31,740 --> 01:02:36,030
What, what happened? What kind of
fucking charade are you running here? Oh,

1116
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:39,660
the guy who killed Kennedy
is dead. Oh, well that's
convenient. There you go. Well,

1117
01:02:39,690 --> 01:02:42,040
let's go back to work in Vietnam and uh,

1118
01:02:42,090 --> 01:02:45,360
Lyndon Johnson's going to take care
of everybody. He loves you. He's a,

1119
01:02:45,361 --> 01:02:47,640
he's a good old boy and it's
terrible to happen that boy Kennedy.

1120
01:02:47,641 --> 01:02:50,940
But you know what? Sometimes those
younguns it's fucking Massachusetts boys.

1121
01:02:50,941 --> 01:02:53,570
They don't know how to shut the fuck up.
Yeah.

1122
01:02:53,580 --> 01:02:58,440
They clink whiskey glasses and they
proceed to fuck headless tie whores,

1123
01:02:58,860 --> 01:03:02,420
you know, come on man, those guys are
animals. Those guys are all savages.

1124
01:03:02,650 --> 01:03:07,030
Let me think. Brian said about
how, um, maybe now they've,

1125
01:03:07,060 --> 01:03:10,750
they're not doing that anymore.
I think that, oh, it's nonsense.

1126
01:03:10,751 --> 01:03:14,500
But I think that idea is like a prevalent
idea and it's a hilarious idea because

1127
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:18,700
if you look back at every age and history,
things accelerate,

1128
01:03:18,730 --> 01:03:23,730
you will find that in every age there
was an idea people had about something

1129
01:03:24,191 --> 01:03:25,150
that was okay,

1130
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:30,100
that a later age found to be
completely an absolutely rock.

1131
01:03:30,370 --> 01:03:34,510
Most recently segregation.
There was a time when,

1132
01:03:34,690 --> 01:03:36,280
I guess our grandparents,

1133
01:03:36,550 --> 01:03:41,230
they would really like go to use
the bathroom and they'd be like, oh,

1134
01:03:41,231 --> 01:03:43,120
there's the white person's bathroom.

1135
01:03:43,390 --> 01:03:45,790
And then they would say to
whoever was working for them,

1136
01:03:45,791 --> 01:03:49,510
like if they happen to take their
a black made on a shopping trip,

1137
01:03:49,511 --> 01:03:53,050
they'd be like, oh, there's the
colored restroom. You can go use that.

1138
01:03:53,230 --> 01:03:56,530
And that was normal. They didn't do
that with some sense of like, ah,

1139
01:03:56,531 --> 01:03:59,080
I don't know if I should
do this or not do them.

1140
01:03:59,230 --> 01:04:03,160
That was a normal state of existence.
If you go back a little bit before that,

1141
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:04,600
there was slavery.

1142
01:04:04,990 --> 01:04:09,160
You would go over to your friend's house
and your friend would have a fucking

1143
01:04:09,161 --> 01:04:11,080
dude that he had bought.

1144
01:04:11,310 --> 01:04:15,670
Did I had to do everything he said
because it was as new beat it. Yeah,

1145
01:04:15,850 --> 01:04:20,110
he beat it. He beat a human fucking
being. That was totally normal.

1146
01:04:20,260 --> 01:04:22,630
And then if you go back
a little bit before that,

1147
01:04:22,930 --> 01:04:26,650
you would wake up in the morning and your
cow's milk would be sour and you would

1148
01:04:26,651 --> 01:04:30,820
go and say to your wife, I think there's
a witch nearby. And she'd be like, well,

1149
01:04:30,821 --> 01:04:31,990
who?
Who Do you think it is?

1150
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:37,200
And you minute and you find a woman and
you'd fucking incinerator on a Goddamn

1151
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:40,630
pyre that was just before slavery.

1152
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:45,240
Now somehow people think that right now
we've got all figured out and there's

1153
01:04:45,250 --> 01:04:50,250
not something equally insane that we all
considered to be a total normal facet

1154
01:04:50,651 --> 01:04:54,220
of reality like all of a sudden know all
of society's totally got it figured out.

1155
01:04:54,250 --> 01:04:55,870
No,
we don't have it figured out.

1156
01:04:56,110 --> 01:04:59,800
The truth of the matter
is there is a hive mind.

1157
01:05:00,010 --> 01:05:05,010
People are leaders in their people who
have under who understand that in primate

1158
01:05:05,171 --> 01:05:05,771
neurology,

1159
01:05:05,771 --> 01:05:10,771
there is a way to tune in to that fucking
frequency of attention and convince

1160
01:05:10,871 --> 01:05:13,330
people that you're the president,
the leader, the king and the Queen,

1161
01:05:13,450 --> 01:05:14,950
whatever the fuck it
is you want to call it.

1162
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:17,620
You can convince primates if you like,

1163
01:05:17,621 --> 01:05:20,200
spend the fucking spiral in
front of them in the right way.

1164
01:05:20,350 --> 01:05:23,230
You can convince them that you're their
leader and they'll just believe it.

1165
01:05:23,260 --> 01:05:26,980
Oh yeah, that's a leader. He is our
president. How? He's my president now.

1166
01:05:27,250 --> 01:05:30,940
Somebody saw that them. Then
I said, noodle fight. He's
my president. Fight you.

1167
01:05:31,090 --> 01:05:33,820
You got to respect the president.
He's our president who's our president.

1168
01:05:33,821 --> 01:05:35,890
Don't talk about our president that way.
Now,

1169
01:05:35,980 --> 01:05:40,980
this is a clearly a form of conditioning
and a form of hypnosis and what I think

1170
01:05:41,241 --> 01:05:44,020
that that, that's like the
final thing for us to overcome.

1171
01:05:44,290 --> 01:05:46,060
We got over fucking slavery,

1172
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:48,880
but it's a weird thing when you're
not supposed to discuss that. No Way.

1173
01:05:48,881 --> 01:05:50,670
You're not supposed to.
It's got to be current guitar.

1174
01:05:51,210 --> 01:05:53,810
You're an intelligent person.
If you're an intelligent person,

1175
01:05:53,811 --> 01:05:54,770
he respected person.

1176
01:05:54,771 --> 01:05:57,530
You go on television and say their
president should be respected no more than

1177
01:05:57,531 --> 01:05:59,160
any other men.
Ooh.

1178
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:08,990
You Know Matt people, people, if
you want to see the conditioning,

1179
01:06:08,991 --> 01:06:10,580
when you watch somebody burner,

1180
01:06:10,790 --> 01:06:13,780
watch someone burn a flag in
front of the wrong person. Yeah,

1181
01:06:13,850 --> 01:06:14,683
people will freak out.

1182
01:06:14,690 --> 01:06:18,110
You want to see the conditioning fucking
burn a hundred dollar bill in front of

1183
01:06:18,111 --> 01:06:19,420
people. No, not the patient.

1184
01:06:19,710 --> 01:06:20,550
There was a story,

1185
01:06:20,551 --> 01:06:24,840
a new story about a dude who was in front
of a Mexican restaurant and he was a

1186
01:06:24,841 --> 01:06:29,841
Vietnam vet and he was angry because the
Mexican restaurant was flying a Mexican

1187
01:06:29,971 --> 01:06:33,450
flag above and American flag,
whatever.

1188
01:06:33,451 --> 01:06:36,150
Apparently this dude said
that that was not legal.

1189
01:06:36,330 --> 01:06:39,990
So he goes there with a fucking knife,

1190
01:06:40,020 --> 01:06:45,020
opens up this giant knife and saws the
rope on this guy's flag in front of this

1191
01:06:45,241 --> 01:06:47,410
man's Mexican restaurant.
Good man,

1192
01:06:47,411 --> 01:06:51,030
holds the flags down
and cuts old glory free,

1193
01:06:51,090 --> 01:06:54,630
folds it up properly and takes
it with them. And he's like,

1194
01:06:54,631 --> 01:06:59,040
you will not disrespect this flag. And
he's like, he clearly states somewhere,

1195
01:06:59,041 --> 01:06:59,701
I don't know where it is.

1196
01:06:59,701 --> 01:07:03,450
Some old asshole who's dead as fuck
wrote down on some piece of paper

1197
01:07:03,460 --> 01:07:07,980
or the old glory. Most be on top.
This is the appropriate late of food.

1198
01:07:08,380 --> 01:07:11,470
America can never be, you know,
[inaudible] never be humble.

1199
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:14,700
You can't be like the third flag.
Yeah. You know, really cool to bat.

1200
01:07:14,710 --> 01:07:17,550
You want to be on top, be on top
Tibet. Who wants to be honest?

1201
01:07:17,610 --> 01:07:19,600
But in the middle of Ireland,
you wanna be in the middle. Okay,

1202
01:07:19,601 --> 01:07:20,560
we'll just be on the bottom.
It's cool who

1203
01:07:21,310 --> 01:07:23,290
we are. America, that's what
I'm talking about there Jo.

1204
01:07:23,291 --> 01:07:26,950
I'm talking about this make this game of
make believe that we're being forced to

1205
01:07:26,951 --> 01:07:27,580
play.

1206
01:07:27,580 --> 01:07:31,590
And it seems like the tea party represents
the people who most want to hold on

1207
01:07:31,591 --> 01:07:35,020
to this silly game of make believe.
And it's like, you know, I, I,

1208
01:07:35,110 --> 01:07:40,110
I love this country and the sense that
I love the geography of the place I'm

1209
01:07:40,151 --> 01:07:40,661
living in.

1210
01:07:40,661 --> 01:07:44,800
I love the cultures here and the people
I've met and I really love like a lot of

1211
01:07:44,801 --> 01:07:46,600
the ways in our culture that um,

1212
01:07:46,780 --> 01:07:50,140
free dialogue can spring up
and all the amazing things.

1213
01:07:50,290 --> 01:07:53,190
But why are you forcing
me to then take that,

1214
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:58,090
that love or a sense of like belonging
here and put it on a God damn symbol?

1215
01:07:58,390 --> 01:08:02,290
Why are you making me put
that on a fucking flag or
on whatever the silly thing

1216
01:08:02,291 --> 01:08:04,630
is that you're turning into an idol?

1217
01:08:04,630 --> 01:08:08,740
I don't want to do that any more and
more as we get smarter. I think as a,

1218
01:08:08,741 --> 01:08:13,480
as a species, that kind of stuff is
becoming less and less palatable.

1219
01:08:13,690 --> 01:08:18,380
And, and, uh, because now when
we're engaged in these ceremonies,

1220
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:20,720
most of us are thinking like,
you know,

1221
01:08:20,721 --> 01:08:23,720
the pledge of allegiance or
whatever at a baseball game.

1222
01:08:23,721 --> 01:08:26,840
I don't even know they do that. A baseball
game, I think, I'm not saying everyone,

1223
01:08:26,841 --> 01:08:29,810
but I think there is a
percentage of people in the
audience who are doing it out

1224
01:08:29,811 --> 01:08:33,140
of just a sense of like, oh, it's kind of
quaint. I'm going to do it. This is weird,

1225
01:08:33,141 --> 01:08:36,160
but you want me to put my
hand on my chest? You so okay.

1226
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:39,760
It was just one of those same reasons
why a lot of people want to be Christians

1227
01:08:39,761 --> 01:08:42,730
and tell you they're Christians because
it automatically carries with it a

1228
01:08:42,731 --> 01:08:45,630
certain amount of respect. And you know,
if you say to me, you know, you know,

1229
01:08:46,750 --> 01:08:48,130
where do you stand with politics?

1230
01:08:48,131 --> 01:08:51,880
You know how you feel I'm
fucking patriot Patriot Bro.

1231
01:08:52,270 --> 01:08:54,550
I fucking believe in this country.
I'm a patriot.

1232
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:57,460
And all of sudden like Dang
guy is not to be questioned.

1233
01:08:57,700 --> 01:09:00,790
You know what I'm saying? Right?
You mean like that guy has a,

1234
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:02,460
there's a certain amount
of respect for you,

1235
01:09:02,461 --> 01:09:05,350
you're going to get from
me for being a patriot.

1236
01:09:05,380 --> 01:09:05,681
Well,
no,

1237
01:09:05,681 --> 01:09:09,820
because I believe in the system and this
president was elected and because this

1238
01:09:09,821 --> 01:09:11,080
president was elected than everything,

1239
01:09:11,090 --> 01:09:14,380
and I just have to go with
what's happening and this
I trust my government now.

1240
01:09:14,620 --> 01:09:15,310
This is a,

1241
01:09:15,310 --> 01:09:19,780
this is the silliest fucking place
to have tea for your mind to get to.

1242
01:09:19,930 --> 01:09:23,410
When you really look back at the fact
that this very same government with the

1243
01:09:23,411 --> 01:09:25,930
same government that enforced segregation,

1244
01:09:26,140 --> 01:09:29,020
it was the same government that illegal.
You went to war in Vietnam.

1245
01:09:29,170 --> 01:09:31,570
It was the same government that told
us that there was weapons of mass

1246
01:09:31,571 --> 01:09:35,020
destruction in Iraq when there were
no weapons of mass destruction.

1247
01:09:35,230 --> 01:09:39,460
This very same government that you've
pledged your allegiance to again and again

1248
01:09:39,461 --> 01:09:43,030
and again and again and again and again
and again and again throughout history

1249
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:47,080
has shown that it does
not do the right thing.

1250
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:51,700
He consistently does shitty things.
Slavery,

1251
01:09:51,820 --> 01:09:55,330
segregation, now it war, war now, bombs.

1252
01:09:55,450 --> 01:09:57,430
Now it will repair
itself from time to time.

1253
01:09:57,431 --> 01:10:00,040
And what's really beautiful
is the promise of democracy,

1254
01:10:00,041 --> 01:10:03,730
the promise of democracy or are a truly,

1255
01:10:03,910 --> 01:10:05,860
I guess what a representative government,

1256
01:10:06,070 --> 01:10:09,640
a truly representative government
is fucking beautiful. Jesus Christ.

1257
01:10:09,641 --> 01:10:11,680
That's like pure evolution. Okay. A purely

1258
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:16,480
representative government
have an educated population,

1259
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:20,950
a truly educated, not just educated
with books and number or you know,

1260
01:10:20,951 --> 01:10:25,120
numbers and words but educated as far as
behavior educated as far as character.

1261
01:10:25,810 --> 01:10:28,900
There's too many of us to get that done.
There's not enough insight.

1262
01:10:29,470 --> 01:10:31,300
I know that that the,
that we are right now,

1263
01:10:31,301 --> 01:10:34,000
the idea is that there's too many of
us and I think that's what this whole,

1264
01:10:34,001 --> 01:10:38,330
I'm a patriot. I'm a Christian. This
is a reason. No, no, no, no, no, no.

1265
01:10:39,180 --> 01:10:42,370
There's a million good things Brian up
anti just what I'm saying. The, the, the,

1266
01:10:42,371 --> 01:10:45,820
the idea is that being a Christian
saying you're a patriots hearing you are,

1267
01:10:45,970 --> 01:10:50,970
you are trying to hold some higher ideal
that you would really like other people

1268
01:10:52,661 --> 01:10:55,120
to do as well.
And if they do do it,

1269
01:10:55,300 --> 01:10:58,000
you know you're going to treat them
better and everyone's going to have more

1270
01:10:58,001 --> 01:11:01,270
energy together. So this is
like, you know, they're trying,

1271
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:04,480
it's like when people say like, I'm, I'm
a Christian. I'm a, I'm a Christian too.

1272
01:11:04,481 --> 01:11:07,150
Even though a lot of them don't
do anything Christian, you know,

1273
01:11:07,151 --> 01:11:09,630
the first thing they want to do
is fucking shoot the enemy. Yeah.

1274
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:10,930
Jesus has turned the other cheek.

1275
01:11:10,931 --> 01:11:14,030
The last thing you want to do is go
and fucking say, I'm a Christian.

1276
01:11:14,060 --> 01:11:17,850
I'm here to fuck people up. Yeah. You
can't say that, man. It's like they're,

1277
01:11:17,851 --> 01:11:20,730
they're, they're saying it because
there is this urge to do it.

1278
01:11:20,750 --> 01:11:25,010
Yeah. It's fun to imagine Jesus
flying the Enola Gay. Like imagine

1279
01:11:27,830 --> 01:11:28,790
fucking beard.

1280
01:11:29,180 --> 01:11:33,200
He's got his toe gone or whatever the
thing is he's wearing and he's flying that

1281
01:11:33,201 --> 01:11:38,201
fucking Enola gay did drop a nuclear
weapon on a population of children and

1282
01:11:38,451 --> 01:11:42,200
women and boyfriends and girlfriends
and artists that Jesus is like,

1283
01:11:42,350 --> 01:11:46,370
I must do this from my father.
Of course not.

1284
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:48,300
Well, I had to get that out,
but what did you mean Brian?

1285
01:11:48,301 --> 01:11:49,134
Like what were you saying?

1286
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,730
No, I mean it's just like you're
saying about how bad the government is,

1287
01:11:52,731 --> 01:11:55,550
how many bad things they've
done, you know, in the past.

1288
01:11:55,551 --> 01:11:58,170
But everyone never looks at the good shit,
you know?

1289
01:11:58,171 --> 01:12:00,720
And no one's ever looking at
all the good shit they do.

1290
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:02,620
I don't think that's going
to tell him the bad stuff.

1291
01:12:02,650 --> 01:12:05,080
I don't think that's necessarily
the Grand Canyon. It's bad ass.

1292
01:12:05,110 --> 01:12:08,110
Did you ever read watership
down? Government didn't
make the grand canyon, Bro.

1293
01:12:09,090 --> 01:12:11,990
He's a fucking buster bubble. Hey, will
you do me a favor of, no, we're not

1294
01:12:12,090 --> 01:12:14,160
plus to play music,
but there's a song that we have to play.

1295
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:17,750
We have to play because I really liked
the song and it's a super appropriate and

1296
01:12:17,751 --> 01:12:20,330
we'll just talk over it.
Okay. We're not like selling,

1297
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:24,990
it's Aaron Lewis country boy. You
know the dude from stained. Okay,

1298
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:30,120
well he's reinvented himself as a
country music singer and yes, yes,

1299
01:12:30,121 --> 01:12:32,880
yes. I want you to you because it's
important. It's really important.

1300
01:12:32,881 --> 01:12:37,110
It's really important for two reasons.
One, because I honestly like the song.

1301
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:39,920
I liked the song a lot. I really
do. It's a fucking good song.

1302
01:12:39,930 --> 01:12:43,590
Guys got a great voice. I loved him and
that, that band stained and he, yeah,

1303
01:12:43,820 --> 01:12:48,410
I think he's a bad motherfucker. He's,
he's got a great voice and a apparel.

1304
01:12:48,430 --> 01:12:51,960
It's just so fascinating because
it's super, super patriotic song.

1305
01:12:51,980 --> 01:12:55,020
Cause here it and it's, it's,
it's, it's so patriotic.

1306
01:12:55,021 --> 01:12:59,160
It's like almost like a parody tone
from the beginning. From the beginning.

1307
01:12:59,350 --> 01:13:03,660
Hit it from the beginning. Here we go.
Ready? It's about being a country boy

1308
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:09,420
that's here. We never play
songs anymore, but fuck it man.

1309
01:13:10,460 --> 01:13:13,430
I love this song.
No dirt around it.

1310
01:13:15,650 --> 01:13:18,830
How do you know? Do the
listen, how good his voice.

1311
01:13:18,831 --> 01:13:21,720
It was probably 1500 bucks back in nine.

1312
01:13:21,850 --> 01:13:23,870
Man. I don't like sounding
like a home. I'll put down,

1313
01:13:23,871 --> 01:13:25,520
motherfuckers got a bad ass voice.

1314
01:13:25,910 --> 01:13:30,080
He could talk to me to bed at night
with that voice. You're alone.

1315
01:13:30,810 --> 01:13:31,643
Listen to this

1316
01:13:34,340 --> 01:13:36,170
change of a man.

1317
01:13:36,610 --> 01:13:39,890
I don't know what is changing.

1318
01:13:44,770 --> 01:13:47,190
Vh One gray. This is a
great fucking song. Dude.

1319
01:13:48,530 --> 01:13:52,290
Rarely drink from the bottle,
but I'll smoke Gulen

1320
01:13:56,200 --> 01:14:00,190
concept. He's onsite, man. He has
don't tread on me. Tattooed on his neck

1321
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:06,640
tense. That's a tense right across
his neck. It says, don't tread on me,

1322
01:14:06,950 --> 01:14:09,850
and this song is talking about how he
never leaves his house without his nine or

1323
01:14:09,851 --> 01:14:12,280
is 45 it's like of gangster rap.

1324
01:14:12,410 --> 01:14:14,810
It's tried to know the words
that come out. La Concha,

1325
01:14:17,110 --> 01:14:18,630
he sold his soul to the devil in La.

1326
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:22,400
This is talking about women's
in that other band winger. Yeah.

1327
01:14:32,650 --> 01:14:37,060
It's the saying, the devil hooked him
up in La with a, like a regular guy.

1328
01:14:37,340 --> 01:14:38,880
You ever see spinal tap?
He's like,

1329
01:14:38,881 --> 01:14:43,500
what he's doing is he's making up for
his time as a Rockstar, a spinal tap.

1330
01:14:43,501 --> 01:14:46,860
When they sit like there's a great thing
where it shows all the pictures of the

1331
01:14:46,861 --> 01:14:49,770
band and they tried every demographic.

1332
01:14:49,771 --> 01:14:53,730
They kept changing demographics according
to what was popular and to like.

1333
01:14:53,731 --> 01:14:57,160
He's just swapped demographics
like, yeah, you've got race entries.

1334
01:14:57,220 --> 01:15:00,150
Publicist was like, hey listen. I
think, I think the country markets,

1335
01:15:00,210 --> 01:15:03,290
he's trying to be legit, just like a
gangster rappers trying to be legitimate.

1336
01:15:03,330 --> 01:15:06,660
In the video. There's a picture
of him like get to holding a gun.

1337
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:09,930
He's two and he's got a gun in his hand.
I am not bullshitting.

1338
01:15:10,210 --> 01:15:11,910
He says me age too.

1339
01:15:11,911 --> 01:15:15,510
He's holding a gun and there's another
picture where he's got a large mouth bass.

1340
01:15:15,540 --> 01:15:20,040
See I used a fish, you know, so
it's like all these pictures of him,

1341
01:15:20,300 --> 01:15:23,700
but all that shit is like so manipulative
and silly and that whole thing, man,

1342
01:15:23,770 --> 01:15:28,340
it gets way better.
I grew up on a country place.

1343
01:15:28,350 --> 01:15:32,460
You never know the last few seconds of it.
I'll tell you Brian,

1344
01:15:32,461 --> 01:15:36,690
exactly where to go because it's so
ridiculous. It was one of my, it's, it's,

1345
01:15:36,691 --> 01:15:40,590
it's just really interesting cause
you know there's a miss hands. No,

1346
01:15:40,650 --> 01:15:44,430
and it's way worst and Mr. Quota,
four minutes and 14 seconds.

1347
01:15:44,810 --> 01:15:46,440
Go do at a four minutes and 14 seconds.

1348
01:15:46,441 --> 01:15:48,330
We'll just end this because
it's fascinating. By the way,

1349
01:15:48,331 --> 01:15:51,330
I'm not dissing this guy at all and
I fucking love this music and I love,

1350
01:15:51,420 --> 01:15:55,020
I love his song and I love that kind of
music. I like a lot of Toby Keith Song.

1351
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:57,150
I don't have anything wrong.
A patriotic songs

1352
01:15:57,650 --> 01:15:59,930
at the end of it.
Listen to sky does this little speech,

1353
01:16:00,260 --> 01:16:01,790
and this is like this old old dude.

1354
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:06,370
It's like, I love my country. I
love my guns, I love my family.

1355
01:16:07,150 --> 01:16:08,230
I love the way it is now.

1356
01:16:08,710 --> 01:16:11,890
And anybody that tried to change
it has to come through me.

1357
01:16:12,670 --> 01:16:13,610
I should be on our head.

1358
01:16:13,700 --> 01:16:17,780
Jeez, it's, this is America and
a country boy was good enough.

1359
01:16:19,070 --> 01:16:19,530
Okay,

1360
01:16:19,530 --> 01:16:23,610
play that back again because that
might be a terrorist message. Okay.

1361
01:16:23,611 --> 01:16:26,090
That re retarded. Fucking
speech. Back it up, right?

1362
01:16:26,150 --> 01:16:27,230
Listen, listen, this

1363
01:16:31,630 --> 01:16:35,680
is that. A bag. Listen, I love
my country. I love my guns.

1364
01:16:36,490 --> 01:16:39,160
I love my family.
I love the way it is now.

1365
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:42,820
And anybody that tried to change
it has to come through me.

1366
01:16:43,470 --> 01:16:45,700
That's a music or attitude that
should be all of our answers.

1367
01:16:45,860 --> 01:16:49,130
This is America and a cargo
is good enough for me.

1368
01:16:49,990 --> 01:16:52,970
Country boy is good enough for me.
Like we are as evolved as I need.

1369
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:56,600
Let's stop right here.
And he sadly,

1370
01:16:56,870 --> 01:16:58,940
if you can listen to a cancer cell,

1371
01:17:00,470 --> 01:17:04,440
just so fucking stupid.
It's like a Loma guns. Oh,

1372
01:17:05,930 --> 01:17:08,810
that's you. Oh, I love my
country. I love my guns. Oh,

1373
01:17:09,290 --> 01:17:11,330
do just hurry up and die
when you fucking hurry up,

1374
01:17:11,331 --> 01:17:15,710
you got he fucking modeled t human being.
You dip shit.

1375
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:20,510
Just die. A family a more
guns. Brow trash picked those.

1376
01:17:20,570 --> 01:17:23,930
They'll come to me. Okay, look, I'm not
saying I want to take your guns, dude.

1377
01:17:24,380 --> 01:17:27,230
I don't want to. I like guns too.
I love my family too. All right.

1378
01:17:27,231 --> 01:17:30,980
Settle the fuck down. Every time it
hits price. Every time in history,

1379
01:17:31,010 --> 01:17:33,800
no one's coming through you bro.
But every period in history,

1380
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:38,120
he's got those human anchors desperately
trying to dig their claws into that

1381
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:43,160
fucking into the earth and keep
evolution from happening. Desperately.

1382
01:17:43,161 --> 01:17:47,840
Fight. They'll kill for it. They'll kill
for it. What do you mean? Wait a minute.

1383
01:17:48,050 --> 01:17:52,250
You can't be serious. Do you? Everyone
gathered around. Did you hear Galileo?

1384
01:17:53,180 --> 01:17:55,750
Did you hear what Galileo just said?
Father,

1385
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:59,390
he said that heard he speak not being,

1386
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:03,470
I love my earth in the
center of the universe.

1387
01:18:03,590 --> 01:18:07,870
Earth sticks and bows and arrows.
I love, I love Burt's ears.

1388
01:18:08,340 --> 01:18:11,180
Muscling.
I love my slave Vernon,

1389
01:18:11,230 --> 01:18:16,190
which is trying to take my catapult
away. I'll come to me. I love my scroll.

1390
01:18:16,340 --> 01:18:20,420
I love my car. I love carving
and rock. I'll love walking.

1391
01:18:20,540 --> 01:18:24,680
I don't need to run any horses. I need
domesticated animals. That's complicated.

1392
01:18:24,930 --> 01:18:26,900
But who wants to domesticate
horse has got to come through me.

1393
01:18:26,930 --> 01:18:28,670
I love being a hunter gatherer.

1394
01:18:28,730 --> 01:18:32,240
I love having a lifespan
in a single cell organism.

1395
01:18:34,470 --> 01:18:37,240
We're all having a good time down here
at the bottom of the ocean floor and

1396
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:39,240
anybody who wants to change,
that's got to come through me.

1397
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:41,010
I love being a carbon molecule.

1398
01:18:45,190 --> 01:18:48,610
I love exists in the pre
big bang conditions. Hello,

1399
01:18:51,510 --> 01:18:53,580
11 protons.
Anybody wants change that

1400
01:18:56,160 --> 01:18:58,910
as I opened up the second bottle of wine,
it's always,

1401
01:19:03,350 --> 01:19:06,850
yeah, I have a question about it.
When you're a beautiful song, man,

1402
01:19:07,240 --> 01:19:10,620
the guy's just sing his fucking ass
off. I'm sorry, I'm not denying it.

1403
01:19:10,630 --> 01:19:13,000
I'm buying that shit on iTunes
right now cause I made funny bro.

1404
01:19:13,001 --> 01:19:16,260
I love that song. No bullshit. I
love and he's a Massachusetts boards.

1405
01:19:16,270 --> 01:19:20,730
Just like me. When you first, when you
first talked about the horse pumping,

1406
01:19:20,740 --> 01:19:23,880
how many dirt roads or in
Massachusetts you called it Mr Hand.

1407
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:28,880
Just because you saw the file name Mr
has done mpeg. Now was that his name?

1408
01:19:29,770 --> 01:19:34,030
His name. The guy who got
fucked to death was Mr hands.

1409
01:19:34,270 --> 01:19:35,770
If you don't know what the
story we're talking about,

1410
01:19:35,771 --> 01:19:40,030
we're talking about a real true story
about a gentleman in Seattle, I believe.

1411
01:19:40,210 --> 01:19:41,620
I believe he was an engineer,

1412
01:19:41,621 --> 01:19:46,621
but he was a professional and he had this
crazy fetish for sex with animals and

1413
01:19:46,871 --> 01:19:51,250
wind up getting killed. And there's a
video of him getting fucked by a horse.

1414
01:19:51,251 --> 01:19:54,610
And the video's Mr [inaudible]. Dot.
Amp Peg and you can get it at two guys,

1415
01:19:54,611 --> 01:19:58,000
one horse.com and then if you're new
to the internet or you don't have any

1416
01:19:58,001 --> 01:20:01,370
fucked up friends like me, you probably,
you might not have ever even seen this.

1417
01:20:01,990 --> 01:20:06,100
It don't. You're right, John, do it.
It's not worth it. So we do that to you.

1418
01:20:06,101 --> 01:20:09,180
So crazy.
Watch a guy get fucked by a horse.

1419
01:20:09,630 --> 01:20:12,470
They were talking about Mr Hands Today.
I worked on this horror movie,

1420
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:14,340
there's low budget horror movie and
they're all talking about Mr hand.

1421
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:15,660
They're all calling it,
you know,

1422
01:20:15,661 --> 01:20:19,440
like you know that and Mr
hands died mpeg or whatever.

1423
01:20:19,770 --> 01:20:23,750
And then they were saying that there's a
Mrs hands and really Oh yeah mrs his is

1424
01:20:23,751 --> 01:20:24,584
even worse.

1425
01:20:24,890 --> 01:20:29,460
Cause he described it where it was the
woman's face is off the side of the thing

1426
01:20:29,610 --> 01:20:30,270
and the horse,

1427
01:20:30,270 --> 01:20:34,620
it was just fucking come and say it pulls
out and just floppy Dick and calm and

1428
01:20:34,621 --> 01:20:38,970
everything. And the girl at one point is
Glenn. Oh yeah. You know like it changes.

1429
01:20:39,630 --> 01:20:42,660
That's old. That's not actually
misses hands. They just called it.

1430
01:20:42,661 --> 01:20:46,050
It's a marketing. Yeah. There was
a dude named Billy Billy Connolly.

1431
01:20:46,051 --> 01:20:50,190
I fucking wash it over his house while
someone's stood guard over the front door.

1432
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:54,980
We were in the basement and what one of
us had to stand guard by the front door

1433
01:20:55,020 --> 01:20:57,990
that were in the basement that would
go up the stairs and stand by the door.

1434
01:20:57,991 --> 01:21:00,030
And if you hear my fucking
mom better say something.

1435
01:21:00,031 --> 01:21:04,650
This is Billy saying cause it's apparently
maybe his mom either caught him with

1436
01:21:04,651 --> 01:21:06,820
it or didn't know he had it.
But there was some issue cause it was,

1437
01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:09,270
it was called barnyard better. Yes. Vhs.

1438
01:21:09,510 --> 01:21:11,760
And then you could barely see
what the fuck was going on.

1439
01:21:11,910 --> 01:21:14,550
It was really shitty quality.
But that's one of the scenes.

1440
01:21:14,730 --> 01:21:18,840
The horse shoots a load all over her and
she makes these moans like Oh yeah and

1441
01:21:18,841 --> 01:21:20,580
it's so disturbing.

1442
01:21:20,700 --> 01:21:24,700
It was like almost like I got
molested that day because the, the,

1443
01:21:24,701 --> 01:21:29,701
the day is literally like broken up
in my memory with these jolting one,

1444
01:21:30,090 --> 01:21:31,710
the standout memories.

1445
01:21:31,900 --> 01:21:36,180
Like you know how you scroll through your
icons if you're a a Mac and you scroll

1446
01:21:36,181 --> 01:21:38,820
through and then they get larger
when your cursor goes over the thing.

1447
01:21:38,821 --> 01:21:41,810
Like that's what those memories are.
And it's like,

1448
01:21:41,830 --> 01:21:44,820
like the whole day is like a normal day.
No memory of the day at all.

1449
01:21:44,821 --> 01:21:47,970
So growing up fuck by a horse
and Billy Connolly's basement,

1450
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,500
I gotta tell you something,
man,

1451
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:54,540
I don't think there is a comparison
between a girl getting hoarse, calm,

1452
01:21:54,541 --> 01:21:55,620
blasted all over.

1453
01:21:55,621 --> 01:22:00,510
And a guy getting impaled to
death on the penis of a horse.

1454
01:22:00,810 --> 01:22:02,180
Those are two different things.

1455
01:22:02,190 --> 01:22:05,760
We didn't have died from getting fucked
by horses. Many people have got it. Sam,

1456
01:22:06,240 --> 01:22:09,300
this woman who was a some,
God damn. Who the hell was

1457
01:22:10,950 --> 01:22:14,220
queen there? My memory sucks. I've
worked all day today in the son.

1458
01:22:14,340 --> 01:22:17,910
Tell him doing something that I goddamn
wish I could tell you folks about.

1459
01:22:18,330 --> 01:22:22,320
I can't tell you. I can't tell
you a damn word, but oh my God,

1460
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:25,340
I can't wait to talk about this once.
It actually happens.

1461
01:22:25,350 --> 01:22:26,990
You can tell you what
happened. I did today. This,

1462
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,220
this a standard insurance
going to be just as awesome.

1463
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:32,940
There's this girl named
standard divas and the baby me,

1464
01:22:34,820 --> 01:22:37,670
she played like this monster,
like a carry monster.

1465
01:22:37,750 --> 01:22:39,660
That's a real name or real name is Sandra.
Yeah,

1466
01:22:39,690 --> 01:22:44,540
that's like a famous name or Larson
in Greece and don't actors slash act.

1467
01:22:44,580 --> 01:22:47,580
Oh, she's waiting on their real
name, but she's a bigger one.

1468
01:22:47,580 --> 01:22:49,850
She's an adult and it was 100,000 wait,

1469

bigger one. Let me check her out.

1470
01:22:52,860 --> 01:22:56,550
And she has a British accent.
Fucking hot as balls.

1471
01:22:56,610 --> 01:23:01,590
What is her Twitter Standard d back?

01:23:07,870 --> 01:23:12,010

at one point and I die from her period

1475
01:23:12,011 --> 01:23:15,380
blood. First of all, you just fucked up
some poor girl named Sandra Dee. Hello.

1476

01:23:20,091 --> 01:23:24,520

1483
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:44,390
She seems like a nice
girl with a love of Atvs.

1484
01:23:44,810 --> 01:23:48,320
There's a photo of her with the ATV
here and she's smiling like, really?

1485
01:23:48,321 --> 01:23:49,670
You want me to take a picture right here

We'll do this podcast and we can't
you folks at home can't see this,

but we're kind of drunk right now.

1510
01:25:15,330 --> 01:25:19,420
It's ridiculous to imagine the incredible
puller heals those tits look real.

1511
01:25:19,460 --> 01:25:23,340
They real. I thought they

1512
01:25:23,350 --> 01:25:25,610
look, if you look at them now, they
can't be real. You know what I think?

1513
01:25:25,650 --> 01:25:28,710
I think she's one of those crazy bitches
that Hedwig real tits and then got a

01:25:35,980 --> 01:25:39,990
That's [inaudible] Twitter. You
don't even do you. Yeah, I do.

1517
01:25:40,050 --> 01:25:44,850
I hope the hackers,
the hackers on everyone.

1518
01:25:50,230 --> 01:25:55,030
I see no pictures of this pitch, Bro.

tricked me man. Kind of photos on it.

1520
01:25:58,970 --> 01:26:03,560
It wears. Speaking of photos,
I heard I heard or heard

1521
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:04,950
the little Hobo game.

1522
01:26:06,150 --> 01:26:10,280
Yeah, little hobos back, but he's smaller.
I ordered the wrong God damn size.

1523
01:26:11,250 --> 01:26:12,120
I think it's funnier.

1524
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:16,300
Could he tell the story? Dude? How
big is it? How big is a little Hobo?

1525
01:26:16,750 --> 01:26:19,690
I don't know. He's like this big and
that's even better. It might be better.

1526
01:26:19,720 --> 01:26:20,141
First of all,

1527
01:26:20,141 --> 01:26:23,680
it's easy to carry him and second of all
it's even creepier than a tiny little

1528
01:26:23,681 --> 01:26:25,600
dog is going to kill you if you
want to do it in New Orleans,

1529
01:26:25,601 --> 01:26:29,070
but I don't think it'll work on fuck it.
It's not going to work. You must do it.

1530
01:26:29,071 --> 01:26:31,930
It's too small. It's like
a tiny little dog. Oh,

1531
01:26:31,931 --> 01:26:33,560
that's the picture of what's
going to the head. It's pretty

1532
01:26:33,650 --> 01:26:37,850
funny and the whole time I'm
laying there while she's up at me,

1533
01:26:37,851 --> 01:26:41,700
I'm just looking up her pussy.
How I'm sure fucking made.

1534
01:26:41,720 --> 01:26:45,890
Her eyes are like look like scary
monster liquor. Just still blue.

1535
01:26:45,900 --> 01:26:46,990
They're the most beautiful geysers

1536
01:26:47,180 --> 01:26:49,440
keep talking.
I'm saying you notify,

1537
01:26:50,790 --> 01:26:55,350
but she's married to a black
wasn't as long as what?

1538
01:26:55,370 --> 01:26:59,260
A black, white and that's K and she's
married to another porn star. Oh,

1539
01:26:59,300 --> 01:27:02,520
how's that work there? They allowed the
only bank people on camera. This is,

1540
01:27:02,700 --> 01:27:05,660
we had Dana DRM on. Don
wants, it was very cool check,

1541
01:27:05,661 --> 01:27:07,760
but she was talking about her
relationship relationship.

1542
01:27:07,761 --> 01:27:10,700
She was in ones where she had a,
a relationship with a porn star,

1543
01:27:10,701 --> 01:27:14,240
but they were only allowed to bank other
people in movies and she caught him bag

1544
01:27:14,241 --> 01:27:17,420
at other people outside of the
movies and she was mad. How dare you,

1545
01:27:20,690 --> 01:27:25,320
we do a bench. I'm Morgan. I'd
be working all day. That was,

1546
01:27:25,670 --> 01:27:29,600
that was like a total loophole in
marriages. Every man would be a porn star.

1547
01:27:29,810 --> 01:27:32,630
We'd all be like, I got to, I'm like, I'm
still, I said, how many times are tough?

1548
01:27:32,660 --> 01:27:35,960
Okay, it's a bad economy. I'm going
to pick up a little money on the side.

1549
01:27:35,961 --> 01:27:37,030
Fucking checks on film.

1550
01:27:37,630 --> 01:27:38,730
Yeah, man. It's still embarrassed.

1551
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:41,740
I mean that's one of the other things
about being human. It's like, you know,

1552
01:27:41,741 --> 01:27:46,741
you're just trapped in these fucking
awful primate monogamy patterns and it's

1553
01:27:47,021 --> 01:27:48,130
just like embarrassing.

1554
01:27:48,131 --> 01:27:51,370
You get jealous or weird and
all that shit's embarrassing.

1555
01:27:51,371 --> 01:27:53,140
It's like the whole situation,

1556
01:27:53,141 --> 01:27:57,220
like we're still stuck in this really
primitive way of living and we can't get

1557
01:27:57,221 --> 01:27:58,040
out of it.

1558
01:27:58,040 --> 01:28:00,740
That's what it is,
is we're becoming aware that it's silly.

1559
01:28:00,920 --> 01:28:03,020
Whereas for the majority of existence,

1560
01:28:03,021 --> 01:28:05,210
it was just accepted and
it wasn't what it was.

1561
01:28:05,211 --> 01:28:06,410
And it was what made you feel good?

1562
01:28:06,620 --> 01:28:09,710
What makes you feel good to conquer
your enemy? You know, it's like Conan,

1563
01:28:09,711 --> 01:28:13,250
what does best in life? What is
that, uh, to crush your enemies,

1564
01:28:13,550 --> 01:28:17,950
to see them driven before you and they
hear the laminations of the women. I know.

1565
01:28:17,970 --> 01:28:21,200
And he had this, uh, you know, and I
mean, but that's what it was, man, man,

1566
01:28:21,201 --> 01:28:25,010
fucking ancient Sumeria or some area,
whatever the fuck you was from.

1567
01:28:25,220 --> 01:28:28,400
That's what it was about. Right. You know,
and that's, that's whatever supposedly,

1568
01:28:28,430 --> 01:28:31,850
you know, it's a fake world, but we're,
we're thinking he lived 6,000 years ago,

1569
01:28:31,851 --> 01:28:34,170
7,000 years ago that some people did.
And then there was,

1570
01:28:34,171 --> 01:28:37,400
it wasn't a lot going on. I like the
first two, but the third, it's like,

1571
01:28:37,401 --> 01:28:40,280
I don't want to hear it. All the commands.
I don't want to hear the limitations.

1572
01:28:40,670 --> 01:28:42,460
I don't mind like crushing
when you hear them go

1573
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:50,280
laminations screaming because you're
fucking getting raped by his limitations

1574
01:28:52,850 --> 01:28:54,260
cause he, you know, he
says it wasn't like he,

1575
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:57,530
it's a word that I've never
used ever. Yeah. It's moaning,

1576
01:28:57,531 --> 01:29:00,940
screaming cause you use this word
by the way, you're a douchebag.

1577
01:29:01,210 --> 01:29:04,350
Mentations use that word.
That word.

1578
01:29:04,950 --> 01:29:08,520
You should hear my wife laminating now.
Is it limitating oh,

1579
01:29:08,521 --> 01:29:11,250
there's some weird thing about
the Jewish Prophet Jeremiah.

1580
01:29:11,340 --> 01:29:14,640
Are you sure this is the same
thing? Pretty sure. What definition?

1581
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:18,180
Isn't it like a nurse or
I went to with a Bible.

1582
01:29:20,490 --> 01:29:25,230
Hmm. The act of laminating and that's
the worst definition. Pressure. Sorrow.

1583
01:29:26,300 --> 01:29:28,570
A cry of sorrow or grief and lemon.

1584
01:29:28,640 --> 01:29:32,280
Asians as the women are crying until,

1585
01:29:32,430 --> 01:29:36,090
until you start because they're getting
raped. No, no. The men are getting killed.

1586
01:29:36,460 --> 01:29:37,900
The Cross.
Do you see them?

1587
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:42,510
The Mongols and the Mongols would
fucking ride in and it was just,

1588
01:29:42,690 --> 01:29:46,050
you would sack a village and
then you would rape the women.

1589
01:29:46,200 --> 01:29:49,560
Are you saying that Conan was
based on the Mongols? I think so.

1590
01:29:49,561 --> 01:29:53,070
I think they drew a lot from it. Cause
this was day bro. It's Robert, he Howard,

1591
01:29:53,071 --> 01:29:56,320
he didn't know about her book and I know
he committed suicide and I used to have

1592
01:29:56,360 --> 01:29:59,360
the fucking poem he wrote when he got
suicide. He's to have it memorized.

1593
01:29:59,380 --> 01:30:00,500
I can't remember it now.
Yeah.

1594
01:30:00,570 --> 01:30:04,440
Did you ever read any of the old
Conan's fuck yeah dude. Fuck yes.

1595
01:30:04,441 --> 01:30:07,100
Things got me through a depressing
high school. Yeah, I love,

1596
01:30:07,710 --> 01:30:10,950
I'm so bummed that apparently the new
movie sucks cause I was like really

1597
01:30:10,951 --> 01:30:14,300
looking forward to, I really wanted
to see it. I love those dudes.

1598
01:30:14,340 --> 01:30:18,240
Well I met the guard too. He came
to the UFC once and he was, uh,

1599
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:22,040
I was Kinda glad that I didn't get a half
to interview him cause he was kind of

1600
01:30:22,140 --> 01:30:24,540
going crazy and I don't know
how I would've reacted to it.

1601
01:30:24,750 --> 01:30:26,490
It was not going crazy in the bathroom.

1602
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:29,070
It was all psych because Chris leaving
wall and he's all pumped up and

1603
01:30:29,071 --> 01:30:33,020
everything. The Goldberg is like, you
know, Mister professional well all.

1604
01:30:33,180 --> 01:30:35,460
Tell us about this movie Conan.
You know, Goldberg is like,

1605
01:30:35,700 --> 01:30:39,250
he's like a super professional
play by play broadcaster guys,

1606
01:30:39,251 --> 01:30:41,910
so he can interview somebody
if he knew nothing about them.

1607
01:30:42,540 --> 01:30:45,630
When I interview somebody, if I know
nothing about them, I feel weird. Right?

1608
01:30:45,990 --> 01:30:48,540
But this guy is the perfect Conan.

1609
01:30:48,690 --> 01:30:52,020
You know people are giving him shit
because they don't like the fact that he's

1610
01:30:52,021 --> 01:30:52,771
pretty,

1611
01:30:52,771 --> 01:30:57,771
they don't like people don't like fucking
six foot four beautiful man sculpted

1612
01:30:58,411 --> 01:31:00,370
bodies and game of Thrones, right? Yeah.

1613
01:31:00,690 --> 01:31:03,060
He's great and fucking game of
Thrones and he have been good.

1614
01:31:03,290 --> 01:31:06,900
This movie is a piece of shit. He's a
good culture and he, there's, there's,

1615
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:11,550
there's scenes where he's fighting as
Conan that are bad fucking ass. There was,

1616
01:31:11,551 --> 01:31:14,880
he's fighting with these things that
are made out of sand and he's like sand

1617
01:31:14,881 --> 01:31:18,690
monsters and the way he moves
around, I'm like this, you nailed it.

1618
01:31:18,691 --> 01:31:23,430
That's Robert Howard's Kona. That's
it. This guy just needs like he needs,

1619
01:31:23,460 --> 01:31:26,460
first of all, you need a singular vision.
You need a guy who's a brilliant writer,

1620
01:31:26,461 --> 01:31:29,310
who's a Robert Howard fan. Go
for it. Create the whole thing.

1621
01:31:29,490 --> 01:31:33,390
But there's scenes where it's just like
so preposterous. They were so dumb.

1622
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:37,950
This the final scene with him and his
antagonist is like one of the dumbest

1623
01:31:37,951 --> 01:31:39,630
scenes in any action movie ever.

1624
01:31:39,780 --> 01:31:43,470
It's almost like they slapped it together
in 10 minutes and filmed it with an

1625
01:31:43,471 --> 01:31:46,170
iPhone.
It's so why do they do that?

1626
01:31:46,171 --> 01:31:48,660
Because there's a bunch of people that
want to get their fucking greedy little

1627
01:31:48,661 --> 01:31:51,150
pause on things.
There's a bunch of different producers,

1628
01:31:51,160 --> 01:31:53,430
a bunch of different executives,
a bunch of different people,

1629
01:31:53,431 --> 01:31:55,890
and they all have their own vision
of how it should work. This guy,

1630
01:31:55,891 --> 01:31:58,680
Jason Momoa is an unknown actor,
fairly unknown.

1631
01:31:58,681 --> 01:32:02,700
At least carry such a gigantic franchise.
It's a $90 million fund

1632
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:06,130
vestments for the studio and all these
assholes want to stick their dirty

1633
01:32:06,131 --> 01:32:10,750
fingers in it and I've seen it, man. I
watched in a fucking movie contagion.

1634
01:32:11,110 --> 01:32:13,270
There was a movie I did
called Frank mccloskey.

1635
01:32:13,271 --> 01:32:18,271
CII and I have talked about it once
before that I did this movie and I watched

1636
01:32:18,461 --> 01:32:23,290
this kid who was a really funny
kid. Frank, I should say his name.

1637
01:32:23,291 --> 01:32:26,000
It's Dave something. Frank McCluskey. See,

1638
01:32:26,900 --> 01:32:30,040
let me look it up just
to give this kid props.

1639
01:32:31,210 --> 01:32:35,410
He was a fucking really funny
comedian man. He's like,

1640
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:38,410
I was watching them,
Dave Sheridan,

1641
01:32:38,650 --> 01:32:42,880
I was watching him like his adlibs. I
was watching his, the way he performs,

1642
01:32:42,881 --> 01:32:46,900
he was like really over the
top almost Jim Carrey in uh,

1643
01:32:46,930 --> 01:32:48,240
ace Ventura ash.
Right.

1644
01:32:48,430 --> 01:32:51,970
And there was a guy who was on the
set who was an executive and um,

1645
01:32:52,030 --> 01:32:54,400
I don't know what production
company film that.

1646
01:32:54,420 --> 01:32:56,650
I was barely paying attention
to any of that shit back then.

1647
01:32:56,860 --> 01:33:01,860
But this guy had the Rolex on and a
super expensive suit with suspenders and

1648
01:33:04,160 --> 01:33:07,510
cufflinks. I mean this is a
fucking, this was a baller.

1649
01:33:07,690 --> 01:33:10,330
This was some guy who
had made a bunch of big,

1650
01:33:10,331 --> 01:33:14,710
big movies already and made a ton of money
and was dressing on this movie set in

1651
01:33:14,711 --> 01:33:16,740
a way that I'd really never seen
anybody addressing the movie.

1652
01:33:16,750 --> 01:33:20,410
Said it was to me it was ridiculous.
And he's wearing this ridiculous,

1653
01:33:20,411 --> 01:33:21,730
it was so obvious.

1654
01:33:21,731 --> 01:33:26,731
He had a ton of money and he was
giving this kid line readings.

1655
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:31,090
This kid was doing his scene and the
kid would do the scene and he would go,

1656
01:33:31,091 --> 01:33:33,280
okay, okay, okay. Instead
of that, how about this?

1657
01:33:33,590 --> 01:33:36,860
But you walk in,
you step one foot on the floor,

1658
01:33:36,950 --> 01:33:41,120
your throw your legs up in the,
he, he, he made it himself.

1659
01:33:41,121 --> 01:33:44,660
He did his own little interpretation of
what he thought would be awesome and the

1660
01:33:44,661 --> 01:33:49,190
scene. And I was like, God
damn here is ego one, a mock,

1661
01:33:49,250 --> 01:33:52,460
some completely uncreative
fuck head wearing.

1662
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:57,320
Cufflinks is telling this
really funny kid. What,

1663
01:33:57,380 --> 01:34:01,190
what to do. And I was watching
it a road right before my eyes.

1664
01:34:01,430 --> 01:34:05,720
I was watching what was like a really
funny script and it really zany kind of

1665
01:34:05,721 --> 01:34:08,210
silly actor. I was like,
oh, it's kind of fun.

1666
01:34:08,300 --> 01:34:11,910
And I watched them poison it or watched
them like stick their dirty fingers.

1667
01:34:12,100 --> 01:34:14,060
And that's what Conan's smelled like.

1668
01:34:14,180 --> 01:34:19,040
Conan smelled like one guy thought we
could do it right and we could recreate

1669
01:34:19,041 --> 01:34:22,740
robbery, Howard's version of
Conan and we could have, you know,

1670
01:34:23,060 --> 01:34:27,050
fucking monsters and sorcery and all
kinds of crazy shit that he fights again.

1671
01:34:27,140 --> 01:34:30,320
We could do this. This could be fucking
wild and studio is like, we're in.

1672
01:34:30,380 --> 01:34:33,650
We got chasing Mamoa from the game of
Thrones. Look at him. He's six foot five.

1673
01:34:33,651 --> 01:34:37,910
He's a fucking male model. He's built like
Hercules. This guy's Conan. He is Kona.

1674
01:34:37,970 --> 01:34:41,870
I want you to meet him. I am Kona. He's
fucking Conan. They get all fired up.

1675
01:34:41,871 --> 01:34:43,640
They do lines and then they
start rewriting the script.

1676
01:34:43,820 --> 01:34:44,780
The executive say they like,

1677
01:34:44,860 --> 01:34:47,330
these guys don't fucking movies
like I know fucking movies.

1678
01:34:47,420 --> 01:34:51,770
I produced 25 fucking movies and they
start getting their dirty little stinky,

1679
01:34:51,771 --> 01:34:56,771
TJ's covered paws all over that script
and they start fucking drop and rocks out

1680
01:34:57,651 --> 01:34:58,190
of the fucking

1681
01:34:58,190 --> 01:35:03,110
nose on key words that they blow it.
But that's when,

1682
01:35:03,470 --> 01:35:04,303
when people,

1683
01:35:04,310 --> 01:35:07,370
or not to get back to the idea where
it's totally different scenarios.

1684
01:35:07,550 --> 01:35:09,930
This is just for entertainment
purposes folks. Please also mean

1685
01:35:11,570 --> 01:35:14,600
I enjoyed the thing we were talking
about at the beginning about, you know,

1686
01:35:14,601 --> 01:35:17,960
when people are used to free
entertainment, you know,
they want it to stay free.

1687
01:35:18,230 --> 01:35:19,040
And you know,

1688
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:22,940
a lot of people when they watch NBC
or ABC or CBS or any of these shows,

1689
01:35:23,300 --> 01:35:24,770
they think they're getting
free entertainment,

1690
01:35:25,010 --> 01:35:27,230
but they're not getting free
entertainment. They're getting,

1691
01:35:27,350 --> 01:35:30,800
they're paying with their attention on
the advertisements, but more than that,

1692
01:35:31,160 --> 01:35:34,250
they're paying in the form of
getting diluted entertainment.

1693
01:35:34,251 --> 01:35:37,520
They're getting shit. It's got, it's
that thing that you just described.

1694
01:35:38,030 --> 01:35:43,030
Every show on a network has had almost
every show has had that exact same thing

1695
01:35:43,701 --> 01:35:48,701
applied to it and so many different ways
because the executives want to sell and

1696
01:35:48,801 --> 01:35:52,390
a depressants or they want to sell
Chevrolets or whatever the fuck they're

1697
01:35:52,400 --> 01:35:55,480
advertising on the show.
So you,

1698
01:35:55,490 --> 01:35:58,220
have you ever had this experience
personally where shit got diluted.

1699
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:02,240
My one experience with a show that
didn't get picked up by comedy central,

1700
01:36:02,360 --> 01:36:04,730
weirdly, because I was prepared for
this. I was like, they're going,

1701
01:36:05,230 --> 01:36:08,270
they're going to comedy central.
Ruined my vision and not the first round.

1702
01:36:08,271 --> 01:36:12,770
And notes that came back was awesome.
It was great notes. Really smart.

1703
01:36:12,830 --> 01:36:15,890
It was like, it made the,
the, the notes made sense.

1704
01:36:15,891 --> 01:36:19,610
There wasn't any kind of weird
like, Oh yes, wait, no, no,
no. I did have it happen.

1705
01:36:19,700 --> 01:36:24,140
I did have it happen when I made some
stuff for fuel TV for this show called

1706
01:36:24,141 --> 01:36:28,410
stupid face. And uh, uh, that,

1707
01:36:28,780 --> 01:36:31,220
that's where we made our
galaxy cabin log cabin.

1708
01:36:31,221 --> 01:36:33,370
And Jodie is living in someone's,
yeah,

1709
01:36:34,670 --> 01:36:38,180
please explain how ridiculous it is.
What it was Julie Diaz doing well,

1710
01:36:38,210 --> 01:36:40,730
this lead of fishermen.
Well, the story was about,

1711
01:36:40,760 --> 01:36:45,760
I played at mountain man and my friend
Brian Jarvis played a space captain and

1712
01:36:47,001 --> 01:36:50,570
something had happened where he'd gotten
sucked into a black hole and a flood.

1713
01:36:50,570 --> 01:36:53,900
It sucked my cabin to a
black hole at the same time.

1714
01:36:53,901 --> 01:36:57,470
And now we fly through space in
this cabin and we're just idiots.

1715
01:36:57,471 --> 01:37:02,440
And like it is the stupidest, I wish
we'd had a bigger budget though magazine.

1716
01:37:02,450 --> 01:37:05,780
It's such a funny idea. So stupid.
I wish to give us more money.

1717
01:37:06,130 --> 01:37:09,680
I know cause we had no budget for the
thing. We had like a green screen.

1718
01:37:09,830 --> 01:37:14,830
So Joey Diaz is episode was
we're like in the cabin and um,

1719
01:37:15,950 --> 01:37:20,840
my grandfather comes like knocks on the
door of the cabin and space and I'm like,

1720
01:37:20,990 --> 01:37:24,110
granddaddy, I thought you
were dead. And he's like,

1721
01:37:24,410 --> 01:37:27,110
Bree wants might the space
commanders ring. He's like,

1722
01:37:27,111 --> 01:37:30,080
let me see your friends ring there.
And my friends like,

1723
01:37:30,110 --> 01:37:32,600
I'm not sure this is your grandfather red.

1724
01:37:32,810 --> 01:37:36,670
And then basically it was
an alien living in the neck,

1725
01:37:36,710 --> 01:37:41,710
my dead grandfather and alien living in
the neck and that was showing him and he

1726
01:37:42,291 --> 01:37:47,291
was called the fishermen and he was in
a rain slicker and it was small bodies

1727
01:37:48,441 --> 01:37:51,250
floating on a canoe.
Joey Diaz nailed is,

1728
01:37:51,251 --> 01:37:56,100
have you ever had children and you and
your wife were getting divorced? She would

1729
01:37:56,100 --> 01:38:00,360
bring that fucking
video to add to a court,

1730
01:38:01,080 --> 01:38:03,660
say this is the kind of
shit I got to deal with.

1731
01:38:05,130 --> 01:38:08,300
If you know, that's another thing
to fight for the kids. No, you win.

1732
01:38:08,380 --> 01:38:10,410
You get the kids,
you can keep them.

1733
01:38:10,900 --> 01:38:13,310
Oh well you don't want him.
And once you become attached to the kids,

1734
01:38:13,311 --> 01:38:16,100
if your wife is crazy,
he comes a real issue with people.

1735
01:38:16,101 --> 01:38:19,730
Or if you feel like your wife is going
to lie and turn your kids on you,

1736
01:38:19,731 --> 01:38:21,760
that's what a lot of men think.
A lot of men are worried.

1737
01:38:21,761 --> 01:38:23,690
I wonder why they think
that. Well, listen man,

1738
01:38:23,691 --> 01:38:26,360
when someone fucking hates you and
they talk shit about you all day,

1739
01:38:26,361 --> 01:38:29,590
that's a terrible thing. If you
go over as a nurse, you know your,

1740
01:38:29,591 --> 01:38:30,440
your mom's house,

1741
01:38:30,441 --> 01:38:33,500
your mom is just constantly talking Shit
about your dad and you go to your Dad's

1742
01:38:33,501 --> 01:38:37,370
house, your dad's constantly talking shit
about your mom. It's like Jesus Christ.

1743
01:38:37,371 --> 01:38:40,760
How the fuck am I ever going to have
a normal relationship at five you dumb

1744
01:38:40,761 --> 01:38:41,890
cunts.
Yeah.

1745
01:38:42,020 --> 01:38:45,710
Fuck heads don't even know how to get
along civilly outside of your fuck time.

1746
01:38:45,950 --> 01:38:48,890
You know you stop fucking and now
you hate each other. You have kids,

1747
01:38:48,891 --> 01:38:52,460
you don't want to be together.
Get, get, grow bro. The fuck
up. You got a kid dummy.

1748
01:38:52,690 --> 01:38:56,860
Yeah. Well, you know, man,
the the problem, the thing
about that Shit, man, is that,

1749
01:38:57,310 --> 01:39:00,610
well, the thing I'm realizing is there
as a fucking shitty network executive in

1750
01:39:00,611 --> 01:39:02,550
everyone's life are most people's lives.

1751
01:39:02,570 --> 01:39:05,750
It's like that shit doesn't
just stop at the network.

1752
01:39:06,270 --> 01:39:09,690
Nah, dude. Most people have
bosses. These are way, way, way,

1753
01:39:09,691 --> 01:39:13,410
way worse and shitty network executives
because if even if you've got a shitty

1754
01:39:13,411 --> 01:39:18,240
network executive, you're on fucking TV
too. All right. You got a television show.

1755
01:39:18,241 --> 01:39:22,770
You're doing something wild and crazy
that very few people ever get to do. Yeah.

1756
01:39:22,790 --> 01:39:27,030
I've dealt with network executives when
we did the man show, we got fucked.

1757
01:39:27,031 --> 01:39:28,200
Doug and I both get fucked.

1758
01:39:28,201 --> 01:39:31,110
It was a disaster and I watched
other people get fucked.

1759
01:39:31,111 --> 01:39:35,280
When I was doing news radio,
I watched the influence I've seen.

1760
01:39:35,310 --> 01:39:37,380
I've seen things that could
have been really good,

1761
01:39:37,410 --> 01:39:41,100
get fucked with combat or when people
don't believe in things because the

1762
01:39:41,101 --> 01:39:43,680
ratings are not good. All of a
sudden they want to bring in people.

1763
01:39:43,681 --> 01:39:47,940
They want to bring in man and bring in
women and hot chicks and we're going to

1764
01:39:47,941 --> 01:39:50,790
mix this up in a network,
has all their nutty fucking ideas.

1765
01:39:50,790 --> 01:39:54,030
How to tune things up and make
them more exciting. It's gross.

1766
01:39:54,031 --> 01:39:55,620
It's annoying as fuck,
man.

1767
01:39:55,830 --> 01:39:58,740
What they're supposed to do is promote
the shit out of the show and if it's not

1768
01:39:58,741 --> 01:40:02,040
good, if it doesn't get good ratings,
just cancel that piece of shit. Sell it,

1769
01:40:02,041 --> 01:40:03,150
don't smell it.
Don't.

1770
01:40:03,151 --> 01:40:07,200
What you don't want to do is get a bunch
of network executives who are generally

1771
01:40:07,201 --> 01:40:12,120
or uncreative people influencing creative
piece. Sure. W the creative people,

1772
01:40:12,121 --> 01:40:15,270
either they do it or they don't do it.
Either it works or it doesn't work.

1773
01:40:15,300 --> 01:40:17,650
That's what I take.
But wouldn't do an executive start

1774
01:40:17,740 --> 01:40:21,910
digging in.
Very few know what they're doing.

1775
01:40:21,940 --> 01:40:25,830
It's very few. Very few
know creatively. Yeah, it's,

1776
01:40:25,850 --> 01:40:30,850
it's like like the time when we are
doing stupid face that the guy we,

1777
01:40:31,231 --> 01:40:33,400
oh, here's the weird thing
that executive are like,

1778
01:40:33,401 --> 01:40:36,490
there are two guys here are
these skateboarders named
Ted and Laban or the main

1779
01:40:36,491 --> 01:40:40,930
producers and they're awesome. Just
crazy. Awesome, brilliant guys.

1780
01:40:41,140 --> 01:40:43,090
Then above them was this guy did,

1781
01:40:43,091 --> 01:40:47,770
they had to pass everything through and
he would give the most random shitty

1782
01:40:47,771 --> 01:40:49,930
notes about stuff that you would do.

1783
01:40:49,931 --> 01:40:53,980
And I was like notes that were impossible
to do it to address, you know, like

1784
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:58,330
not specific notes like I'm
trying to think of like, so
we know like to on notes,

1785
01:40:58,331 --> 01:41:00,340
like, you know, this was good,

1786
01:41:00,610 --> 01:41:04,750
but it would be better if we
could make it more laughy. Whoa.

1787
01:41:04,780 --> 01:41:07,270
You know what I mean? Like kind of
ambiguous notes were like, well what?

1788
01:41:07,330 --> 01:41:10,300
How do I make something black coffee
or more like, you know what I mean?

1789
01:41:10,301 --> 01:41:13,750
There's like, do you mean fun z? What,
what are your specific problems with it?

1790
01:41:13,990 --> 01:41:16,720
But that was the one experience
I had with that. But,

1791
01:41:16,990 --> 01:41:21,190
but I have obviously heard shitloads
of people having these problems.

1792
01:41:21,400 --> 01:41:23,890
It's kind of like remembering, you
weren't when you were in reading class,

1793
01:41:23,891 --> 01:41:27,010
when you're learning to read as a kid
and you'd sit in a circle and you'd read.

1794
01:41:27,340 --> 01:41:30,250
Yeah. And there was always that kid
who slowed the whole thing down.

1795
01:41:30,280 --> 01:41:35,280
It would get to that one kid
who's like there is right.

1796
01:41:35,801 --> 01:41:38,560
You know, and you knew how to read. You
are, you know, you can read pretty fast,

1797
01:41:38,561 --> 01:41:41,750
but the whole fucking thing,
lunch was being fucking push back.

1798
01:41:41,751 --> 01:41:45,640
Cause this one thing when the same way
those people insert themselves into power

1799
01:41:45,641 --> 01:41:46,570
positions,
right.

1800
01:41:46,750 --> 01:41:50,110
And they'll put themselves into like
creative power positions or they're

1801
01:41:50,111 --> 01:41:54,010
everywhere. They're in fee even affected
everything. But now they have power.

1802
01:41:54,340 --> 01:41:55,680
Imagine if the kid got his,

1803
01:41:55,780 --> 01:41:57,060
let me tell you something that's an,

1804
01:41:57,130 --> 01:42:01,780
that's an unrealistic characterization
because it's very fucking difficult to

1805
01:42:01,781 --> 01:42:03,680
become a neck network
executive. Right? Most of them.

1806
01:42:04,590 --> 01:42:06,950
No, I don't mean that kitty. We
know. I don't mean they can't read.

1807
01:42:07,160 --> 01:42:08,990
I mean there are like that for creativity.

1808
01:42:09,290 --> 01:42:11,290
I'm saying their skill
level for creativity.

1809
01:42:11,370 --> 01:42:13,160
The same as the kid who
can't read or write.

1810
01:42:13,190 --> 01:42:16,280
But I thought you were talking
about those people. No, no.

1811
01:42:16,281 --> 01:42:17,500
Hopefully those people learn to read

1812
01:42:17,910 --> 01:42:19,980
z Z.
I think it's an ego thing entirely.

1813
01:42:19,981 --> 01:42:22,350
I think they become successful and
successful people think they're good at

1814
01:42:22,351 --> 01:42:22,950
everything.

1815
01:42:22,950 --> 01:42:25,530
That's why people who were successful
at one thing don't like learning other

1816
01:42:25,531 --> 01:42:26,380
things.
You know,

1817
01:42:26,470 --> 01:42:29,100
one of the biggest problems in mixed
martial arts fighters is people who have a

1818
01:42:29,101 --> 01:42:33,290
specialty and don't want to learn
another specialty. You become, yeah,

1819
01:42:33,400 --> 01:42:34,920
they become very,
very one dimensional.

1820
01:42:34,921 --> 01:42:38,070
There's a lot of fighters like that
where they're really good kickboxers and

1821
01:42:38,071 --> 01:42:42,450
they never learned how to wrestle or do
Jiu Jitsu. Good. Yeah, no, it's terrible.

1822
01:42:42,451 --> 01:42:46,410
It's terrible for them. And the problem
is they're not willing to be a novice.

1823
01:42:46,411 --> 01:42:49,170
There's so good at that one thing that
that's the thing they want to train all

1824
01:42:49,171 --> 01:42:50,260
the time because they're so good.
Yeah.

1825
01:42:50,340 --> 01:42:53,310
But whenever you see how he's just someone
just showing me this website for this

1826
01:42:53,311 --> 01:42:58,180
actress and it's her resume
and it's like director, actor,

1827
01:42:58,200 --> 01:43:00,150
producer,
writer.

1828
01:43:00,270 --> 01:43:03,600
There was like seven things that
she said she was and it was like,

1829
01:43:03,630 --> 01:43:06,390
Oh God could give me a fucking break.

1830
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:09,900
And then like that she had quotes,
you know,

1831
01:43:09,930 --> 01:43:13,200
like referenced to it of Healer.
That shit. Yeah. It's like, you know,

1832
01:43:13,201 --> 01:43:16,380
when you in spiritual guy and some
people do it, some people do it,

1833
01:43:16,381 --> 01:43:20,220
some people like we'll have like nine
things going at once. But I always,

1834
01:43:20,310 --> 01:43:23,820
there's something I respect and people
who are just focused on this one thing,

1835
01:43:24,090 --> 01:43:29,010
like just start, there are
a writer. That's what they
do, right? They just, right.

1836
01:43:29,011 --> 01:43:30,060
I think that's cool. Well, it'd

1837
01:43:30,060 --> 01:43:34,040
be in a comic, you know, I
mean, I do a lot of other
shit besides comedy. Like, uh,

1838
01:43:34,200 --> 01:43:36,360
I do the UFC and,
and do other things.

1839
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:41,140
So what I've managed to do is be
professional, a professional. Me, I'm,

1840
01:43:41,160 --> 01:43:43,390
I'm me professionally.
So that's, that's what,

1841
01:43:43,500 --> 01:43:46,470
and so I put me in certain situations,

1842
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:50,760
I put me in a situation where there's
some fights going on and have to explain

1843
01:43:50,761 --> 01:43:52,070
what's on in a way

1844
01:43:52,070 --> 01:43:54,470
that people are gonna think it's
entertaining and ingest that.

1845
01:43:54,710 --> 01:43:58,250
And then there's other me where I'm
going on a stage in front of a bunch of

1846
01:43:58,251 --> 01:43:59,340
people and I,
I,

1847
01:43:59,360 --> 01:44:02,150
I'm going to say things in a certain
way that's gonna make them laugh.

1848
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:06,830
Or I'm me and I'm talking on the Internet.
And the podcast, you know, or um,

1849
01:44:06,831 --> 01:44:11,660
me and getting people to do
something fucked up on fear factor.

1850
01:44:11,690 --> 01:44:15,530
I just, I'm a professional
meet. What's that?

1851
01:44:16,020 --> 01:44:19,610
Talk about that thing. Oh yeah. I wish
I could too, but I cannot sir. Yes.

1852
01:44:19,640 --> 01:44:23,360
Photos or something you can't talk about
on his phone will be able to talk about

1853
01:44:23,361 --> 01:44:27,650
it eventually. It's, it's insane.
Oh, it's terrible. It's terrible.

1854
01:44:27,740 --> 01:44:29,240
It's amazing.
It's amazing.

1855
01:44:29,241 --> 01:44:33,740
The difference between 2002 fear factor
in 2011 fear factor. It's just like,

1856
01:44:33,980 --> 01:44:37,580
Oh yes. That's exactly what
happened. The Internet,

1857
01:44:37,581 --> 01:44:41,180
no question about it has changed our,
our line in the sand.

1858
01:44:41,430 --> 01:44:45,800
It reminds me of when rap turned in to
gangster rap. Remember that transition?

1859
01:44:45,801 --> 01:44:49,010
This is way crazier than that dude.
I mean hip hop,

1860
01:44:49,280 --> 01:44:51,510
but to the hippity hip hop too,

1861
01:44:51,750 --> 01:44:56,210
like some Nwa or something like
that's terrible. Yeah, exactly.

1862
01:44:56,211 --> 01:45:01,070
It's terrible. It is. By the way,
when I was, when you were taught,

1863
01:45:01,071 --> 01:45:04,550
just talking about it is always
drinking the coconut water. I gagged.

1864
01:45:05,480 --> 01:45:08,030
I'm immune. I was right there.
And not only was I right there,

1865
01:45:08,031 --> 01:45:11,810
I was right there while there
was people vomiting and nothing.

1866
01:45:12,290 --> 01:45:14,180
I'm immune to vomit.
It's crazy man.

1867
01:45:14,181 --> 01:45:18,470
My little baby threw up in the bed the
other night and uh, you know, it's sad.

1868
01:45:18,560 --> 01:45:19,490
You know,
she was okay.

1869
01:45:19,491 --> 01:45:22,720
She just sometimes kids that cough while
they have food in their mouth and he'd

1870
01:45:22,721 --> 01:45:25,400
just throw out all the fuck.
Yeah.

1871
01:45:25,401 --> 01:45:29,720
But cats are gross to throw up so much
because they lift their hair, man,

1872
01:45:30,660 --> 01:45:32,300
the lick,
their own hair.

1873
01:45:32,300 --> 01:45:35,180
That's one reason they either
they have to throw up those,

1874
01:45:35,181 --> 01:45:37,030
those hairballs and
sometimes they get food.

1875
01:45:37,310 --> 01:45:41,320
She throws up every three times a week,
three, four times a week. My female,

1876
01:45:41,640 --> 01:45:45,500
my mail doesn't throw up.
And you know what else I've done.

1877
01:45:45,501 --> 01:45:47,150
I started bringing them to the groomer,

1878
01:45:47,180 --> 01:45:50,030
which is great for them cause it's
hot as fuck out here in California.

1879
01:45:50,270 --> 01:45:53,420
And so I don't let him out. I do let
him out in the courtyard sometimes,

1880
01:45:53,421 --> 01:45:57,470
but outdoor cats,
I believe that cats should be free.

1881
01:45:57,471 --> 01:46:01,250
And I've had outdoor cats in my life and
I believe that's the best way for cats,

1882
01:46:01,251 --> 01:46:05,420
but I'm terrified of that fucking toxo
plasma shit. You know? You can say that.

1883
01:46:05,421 --> 01:46:08,880
That's ridiculous, but if you, if you
read about it, I might have it to him.

1884
01:46:09,580 --> 01:46:11,570
You got to talk to me. A microphone,
homeboy. You got to talk.

1885
01:46:11,590 --> 01:46:14,780
Anybody 100% serious
that I will take a test.

1886
01:46:14,781 --> 01:46:19,460
We should all take a to put your
headphones on. You think you have it? No,

1887
01:46:19,461 --> 01:46:22,040
I don't think I have it, but I think
we definitely need to take a text.

1888
01:46:22,070 --> 01:46:26,110
I think we should do it on the show.
Yeah, you're right. I think Joey Diaz,

1889
01:46:26,120 --> 01:46:29,780
how's it by the way? You can. You
can have it and be a healthy version.

1890
01:46:30,260 --> 01:46:34,490
It just affects your judgment
apparently or has a effect. Look,

1891
01:46:34,610 --> 01:46:37,970
if you're slightly cranky, that also
affects your judgment. You know,

1892
01:46:37,971 --> 01:46:40,460
there's a lot of things that affect your
judgment if you haven't gotten enough

1893
01:46:40,461 --> 01:46:43,870
sleep. If you're in a bad relationship,
there's things that affect your judge.

1894
01:46:43,871 --> 01:46:47,680
I know I've got it. I fucking change so
many bags of cat litter. When I was like,

1895
01:46:48,310 --> 01:46:50,280
breathing in that shit is probably

1896
01:46:50,280 --> 01:46:54,950
not to worry because it's not. I worry
because I've had feral cats. I had,

1897
01:46:55,070 --> 01:46:59,140
wow. I did too. I captured six kittens,
brought him back to my apartment. Oh,

1898
01:46:59,141 --> 01:47:01,170
we both have feral kittens.
I'm festering.

1899
01:47:01,180 --> 01:47:05,530
Came around by their neck on by
your mouth. I caught him in a box.

1900
01:47:06,310 --> 01:47:10,480
I caught him in a box and a construction
site and they were assholes. Man.

1901
01:47:10,481 --> 01:47:11,530
I wish I'd never done it.

1902
01:47:12,050 --> 01:47:15,380
Well, they're scared of people, but
they will bond to one person and really,

1903
01:47:15,381 --> 01:47:17,480
really be attached to my account
was super attached to me,

1904
01:47:17,481 --> 01:47:19,180
but terrified of everybody else.
Ma'Am

1905
01:47:19,900 --> 01:47:22,820
have cats. What? Why?

1906
01:47:23,970 --> 01:47:26,850
Because I was an idiot. You've got to
have a lot of responsibility. Yeah.

1907
01:47:26,920 --> 01:47:30,510
Pet cats are like, hey, it's
easier than a fucking Hams.

1908
01:47:30,511 --> 01:47:35,370
People don't understand
more responsibility than a
plant. Yes. And, and also,

1909
01:47:35,371 --> 01:47:37,950
and also depending on your conditioning,
some people,

1910
01:47:38,160 --> 01:47:43,160
some people raise other people to think
that cats are like one step above like a

1911
01:47:43,531 --> 01:47:47,670
steak. Like people don't, a lot of people
don't, they don't have animal empathy,

1912
01:47:47,671 --> 01:47:49,510
so they're really shitty
with their animals.

1913
01:47:49,860 --> 01:47:52,170
Like when you drive by someone's
porch and they've got a dog.

1914
01:47:52,171 --> 01:47:55,170
I'm like a tiny little chain
and I think that's normal.

1915
01:47:55,440 --> 01:48:00,240
People think that's normal or people
only like walk their dogs for or do dogs

1916
01:48:00,241 --> 01:48:02,160
who don't have a backyard.
People only walk.

1917
01:48:02,161 --> 01:48:05,880
Their dogs are like five minutes a day.
Like you can't do that. You'd have to,

1918
01:48:06,030 --> 01:48:09,440
you got a dog,
you have to walk your dog like 45 minutes.

1919
01:48:09,500 --> 01:48:12,030
What ever you should aids walking.

1920
01:48:12,150 --> 01:48:15,120
What do you mean you should if you don't
have a big yard or are you just should

1921
01:48:15,150 --> 01:48:15,600
no matter what.

1922
01:48:15,600 --> 01:48:18,830
Well, I mean for what it's worth,
that's what the doc whisperer sad.

1923
01:48:18,850 --> 01:48:20,560
He said dogs need like a 45 minute.

1924
01:48:20,760 --> 01:48:25,020
I remember different
breeds on these Pekinese.

1925
01:48:25,040 --> 01:48:28,520
My dog loves it. That's the point.
My dog loves a good long walk.

1926
01:48:28,521 --> 01:48:32,570
It's clearly like he wants to be
cooped up in a fucking house all day.

1927
01:48:32,650 --> 01:48:35,800
My dog. That's totally true. I hope
I have a one solution when my dogs,

1928
01:48:35,801 --> 01:48:39,190
I have a giant yard that I
have a yard for my dogs only.

1929
01:48:39,191 --> 01:48:42,970
That's a full acre wooded
saw pine trees all day.

1930
01:48:42,971 --> 01:48:46,480
They're just fucking chasing squirrels
and having a party up there. Fine. Yeah.

1931
01:48:46,481 --> 01:48:46,971
But I,

1932
01:48:46,971 --> 01:48:51,970
I bought this place specifically because
it had this big lock right next to it

1933
01:48:51,971 --> 01:48:53,970
and I knew that I'd keep my
dogs then. Yeah. You know,

1934
01:48:54,070 --> 01:48:55,600
I feel like if you have dogs,
man,

1935
01:48:55,601 --> 01:48:59,210
you have a responsibility to give those
dogs like a fun environment. Totally.

1936
01:48:59,230 --> 01:49:01,900
You know, like my dogs are happy
as fuck you come to your mind dogs,

1937
01:49:01,901 --> 01:49:04,240
they're wagging their tail and shit.
They're never like freaking out.

1938
01:49:04,280 --> 01:49:08,260
They're stuck in this yard, their yard.
She huge, you know, it's a full acre.

1939
01:49:08,290 --> 01:49:12,010
Yeah. Yeah. I think I've basically
transformed my dog and down monkey.

1940
01:49:12,011 --> 01:49:15,430
My dogs turned into something more
than a dog because I treat you,

1941
01:49:15,450 --> 01:49:19,180
I treat my dog like a person and I
feel like my dog understands that.

1942
01:49:19,360 --> 01:49:24,250
I think that dogs can become like these
amazing creatures if you give them

1943
01:49:24,251 --> 01:49:24,791
enough love.

1944
01:49:24,791 --> 01:49:28,990
Sure that people are dumb and they don't
get that and so they like give him some

1945
01:49:29,080 --> 01:49:31,810
dry food and water and
let them lay on the couch.

1946
01:49:31,811 --> 01:49:35,400
I'll fucking day it says it doesn't
want to do that. They want walks, man.

1947
01:49:35,680 --> 01:49:37,090
If your dog doesn't want attention,

1948
01:49:37,120 --> 01:49:40,530
they want attention and he
wants to simulation and they
want to be outside. Yes,

1949
01:49:40,750 --> 01:49:45,160
they need the outside. They need the
air, they need this. The squirrels.

1950
01:49:45,550 --> 01:49:48,880
Oh guys really loved it when we lived in
Colorado because we lived in Colorado,

1951
01:49:48,881 --> 01:49:50,650
they were just roam free.
You know,

1952
01:49:50,651 --> 01:49:54,130
I was on 148 acres in the
mountains so I didn't have a fence.

1953
01:49:54,370 --> 01:49:55,750
I just let them outside at night.

1954
01:49:55,751 --> 01:49:59,230
What I did was we were there every day
for weeks and we let them know this is

1955
01:49:59,231 --> 01:50:01,150
where everybody lives. Okay,
this is where we live now.

1956
01:50:01,300 --> 01:50:04,360
And they figured it out really quick
and I just did it totally natural style.

1957
01:50:04,361 --> 01:50:07,970
I just, you know, walked him with me
and I took them with me on walks. We,

1958
01:50:07,980 --> 01:50:10,960
we know we scattered up perimeter.
They got ahead of me sometimes,

1959
01:50:11,050 --> 01:50:11,831
but when they got ahead of me,

1960
01:50:11,831 --> 01:50:13,750
they always went right back
to the house if we lost them.

1961
01:50:14,090 --> 01:50:16,990
It was pretty interesting until the dog
got emailed the mountain mine of course.

1962
01:50:17,010 --> 01:50:18,010
Cheers.
Cheers.

1963
01:50:18,090 --> 01:50:20,790
Frankie Harris and drinking game.

1964
01:50:20,791 --> 01:50:23,670
You have to just bring
up the traumatic story.

1965
01:50:28,380 --> 01:50:30,270
It's my little buddy.

1966
01:50:30,510 --> 01:50:31,343
It's a sad story.

1967
01:50:31,640 --> 01:50:36,170
Did you hear about this fucking shit
about lifelike cells made of metal that

1968
01:50:36,171 --> 01:50:36,500
they've,

1969
01:50:36,500 --> 01:50:41,500
they've figured out a way and then
they're theorizing now that there might be

1970
01:50:41,570 --> 01:50:45,380
living things out there in the
university evolve from metal. Yeah.

1971
01:50:45,700 --> 01:50:50,550
Like fucking terminator type
Shit. Yeah, of course. Yeah. That,

1972
01:50:50,551 --> 01:50:52,060
I mean,
what the fuck man?

1973
01:50:52,061 --> 01:50:55,720
That's the same thing like people thinking
that let light it has to be water and

1974
01:50:56,210 --> 01:50:57,600
times that's the,

1975
01:50:57,601 --> 01:51:00,490
isn't that the same thing as thinking
that the earth is in the center of the

1976
01:51:00,491 --> 01:51:02,940
fucking universe? It's the
same silly idea. Right?

1977
01:51:03,330 --> 01:51:05,130
The scientists said,
listen to this statement,

1978
01:51:05,160 --> 01:51:10,160
I am 100% positive that we can get
evolution to work outside organic biology.

1979
01:51:11,490 --> 01:51:15,900
How funky boy fucking scary is that.
Yeah,

1980
01:51:16,070 --> 01:51:17,480
totally.
That's what the article says.

1981
01:51:17,510 --> 01:51:20,720
It's probably like that monkey boy from
the old son TV or the national enquirer.

1982
01:51:20,721 --> 01:51:25,160
The screaming monkey boy,
monkey boy says Mr. Sign.

1983
01:51:25,220 --> 01:51:30,020
Just fellow. He's from,
his name was Lee Cronin.

1984
01:51:30,130 --> 01:51:31,750
So what do you have to
be to be a scientist?

1985
01:51:31,751 --> 01:51:34,300
Can do you have to go to school work
and you just like three times things and

1986
01:51:34,301 --> 01:51:36,500
call yourself a sign. That's
an interesting point. I think.

1987
01:51:36,720 --> 01:51:39,820
You think you have to have some sort
of a degree to be taken seriously?

1988
01:51:39,850 --> 01:51:42,040
You can your mom right you the degree
and say from her knowledge and her

1989
01:51:42,060 --> 01:51:42,770
backyard,
you

1990
01:51:42,770 --> 01:51:45,110
silly goose.
This guy's from the University of Glasgow.

1991
01:51:45,111 --> 01:51:49,640
He's from Scotland and his building
blocks are largely, oh Jesus.

1992
01:51:49,641 --> 01:51:54,470
Say this word. Poly Ox. So, but tell a

1993
01:51:55,970 --> 01:52:00,860
ox Pauline [inaudible]. Oh, you
mean poly ox and metallic? Oh yes.

1994
01:52:00,861 --> 01:52:05,810
I mean poly oxo met towel.
Yes.

1995
01:52:05,811 --> 01:52:08,270
That's,
it may have a range of metal atoms.

1996
01:52:08,271 --> 01:52:11,510
Mostly tungsten linked to
oxygen and phosphorous.

1997
01:52:11,750 --> 01:52:13,730
By simply mixing them in a solution,

1998
01:52:13,731 --> 01:52:17,270
he can get them to self
assemble into cell likes. Fears.

1999
01:52:18,260 --> 01:52:19,820
Whoa.
That's called.

2000
01:52:19,970 --> 01:52:22,790
Could you imagine if we fucking
showed up on some planet somewhere?

2001
01:52:22,791 --> 01:52:27,020
And they really were like maximum crime.
They were like the transformers.

2002
01:52:27,200 --> 01:52:30,800
What about transformers were
real, man, this, this, they
should have released this.

2003
01:52:31,070 --> 01:52:34,310
If they released this just six
months or six weeks rather before the

2004
01:52:34,311 --> 01:52:37,820
transformers movie came out and they can
have this information along with their

2005
01:52:37,821 --> 01:52:42,170
teasers. It can be a more exciting
movie for me because I'd be like,

2006
01:52:42,171 --> 01:52:45,860
maybe it's not so preposterous.
And these big stupid cars,

2007
01:52:46,240 --> 01:52:51,200
com people saving robots, I think give
a fucking flying shit about people,

2008
01:52:51,260 --> 01:52:55,490
Dude. I, what about the sun? I mean,
maybe the son's alive. That's it.

2009
01:52:55,500 --> 01:52:57,950
That to me it's like why God,
why think about other planets.

2010
01:52:58,130 --> 01:53:00,350
You have this source of
all life on this planet,

2011
01:53:00,351 --> 01:53:03,860
the main energy source for all life on
this planet outside of things that are

2012
01:53:03,861 --> 01:53:08,360
getting it from like a steam vents
that they brought him in the sea. Uh,

2013
01:53:08,450 --> 01:53:11,390
things that are living in thermal
ducks or whatever. I'll do,

2014
01:53:11,391 --> 01:53:15,980
I'll go you one further please. We're
made out of stars. We're literally,

2015
01:53:15,981 --> 01:53:20,710
every fucking is single piece
of your body is stardust.

2016
01:53:20,730 --> 01:53:21,563
Yeah.

2017
01:53:21,620 --> 01:53:26,620
I mean that that is what happened to human
biology is a direct result of fucking

2018
01:53:27,230 --> 01:53:29,300
son's blowing up.
That's right.

2019
01:53:29,480 --> 01:53:33,410
That's the only way you get
the information to make human
beings or the, the, the,

2020
01:53:33,411 --> 01:53:37,020
the materials. It's so incredible
that it, yeah, it sounds ridiculous.

2021
01:53:37,021 --> 01:53:39,290
Stuff like a kitty Roger's song.
We're like retarded.

2022
01:53:42,370 --> 01:53:46,510
No, not just kidding. Dot. Katie Rogers,
he log book, but Kenny Loggins. No,

2023
01:53:46,511 --> 01:53:51,020
it sounds like the, the fucking, the
highway men. That was a highway man. Yeah.

2024
01:53:51,430 --> 01:53:52,530
Costa goes calls.

2025
01:53:54,090 --> 01:53:58,810
Where does it match and pistol grandmas.
God, I love that song. It's a great song,

2026
01:53:58,811 --> 01:54:00,160
man.
When Johnny Cash comes on,

2027
01:54:00,460 --> 01:54:05,460
I ride a star ship cross
the also university of eyes
and when I reached here,

2028
01:54:10,450 --> 01:54:13,090
if you haven't seen, it's a,
it's a song. The highway men.

2029
01:54:13,710 --> 01:54:15,970
It's about real good up Brian.
We're, we already violated.

2030
01:54:15,971 --> 01:54:19,410
Our music is great and this is what
happens when we get drunk. That's one.

2031
01:54:19,411 --> 01:54:21,490
He opened herself up to get sued.
Aaron Lewis,

2032
01:54:21,491 --> 01:54:24,280
please don't sue me or you think you're
fucking music's awesome. I love it too,

2033
01:54:26,200 --> 01:54:29,970
son. I'm officially hammer. I've got blood

2034
01:54:30,070 --> 01:54:35,060
is to drink it too much. We're
stones. We're drinking wine. I'm on.

2035
01:54:35,061 --> 01:54:37,900
Ion is fucked up.
I ate so much fake,

2036
01:54:37,901 --> 01:54:41,230
but today I think I might shit
out and living in that water.

2037
01:54:41,270 --> 01:54:44,450
What's it made out of? I don't
know. But they said not to drink it,

2038
01:54:44,480 --> 01:54:47,720
but they were squirting it in
my face. Right. I drank it. Wow.

2039
01:54:47,750 --> 01:54:51,160
They said not to drink it,
but you're dragging your
swipe. Clever. Cheers. Cheers.

2040
01:54:52,040 --> 01:54:56,520
My little retard buddy. Yeah.
You're not a retard retired.

2041
01:54:56,521 --> 01:54:59,300
Your only play one on the podcast.
It's awesome.

2042
01:55:02,510 --> 01:55:03,660
So I understand going on,

2043
01:55:03,760 --> 01:55:07,080
Ari Shaffir I was going to branch
out on his own and have iTunes.

2044
01:55:07,520 --> 01:55:10,140
He just wanted to, to frank was
frequently. And when you're doing it well,

2045
01:55:10,141 --> 01:55:13,350
he also wants you to do it. He's he, you
know, it's hard to do. Uh, you know, your,

2046
01:55:13,351 --> 01:55:15,060
your podcast is getting super popular.

2047
01:55:15,061 --> 01:55:17,220
You've got so many people that
are doing it. If you don't know,

2048
01:55:17,221 --> 01:55:20,880
Brian has a whole network of
podcasts on iTunes called desk squad,

2049
01:55:20,881 --> 01:55:24,070
and it's with a bunch of great comics.
There's Sam Tripoli,

2050
01:55:24,071 --> 01:55:28,300
he's got a podcast and now John Reap
and John Heffron, our buddies are, are,

2051
01:55:28,410 --> 01:55:32,940
are doing a podcast and Tom Segura
and his wife are doing a podcast.

2052
01:55:32,970 --> 01:55:36,520
Sam Tripoli's doing a podcast.
Did I miss anybody? Uh,

2053
01:55:36,540 --> 01:55:39,540
low Esther once in a while
does wine Brody does when he's,

2054
01:55:39,541 --> 01:55:44,130
when he's feeling good. And I love how
you phrase that. Know they just had Steve

2055
01:55:44,130 --> 01:55:48,180
O on and they've had a bunch of really
good ones the day before that Mike Tyson

2056
01:55:48,181 --> 01:55:51,180
and him ran into each other at their face.

2057
01:55:51,190 --> 01:55:53,940
And then you didn't hear what happened
at the roads and Charlie Sheen roast.

2058
01:55:53,970 --> 01:55:55,020
Now I don't,
this is just,

2059
01:55:55,080 --> 01:55:59,490
I heard from word of word of
word internet or know of people.

2060
01:55:59,880 --> 01:56:02,110
I heard that. Is it on the
Internet? Did you search?

2061
01:56:02,920 --> 01:56:07,920
They just recorded it Saturday
supposedly a Steevo as Mike Tyson.

2062
01:56:08,821 --> 01:56:12,930
If he could run into his fist with
his face. And when he, when he did it,

2063
01:56:12,960 --> 01:56:15,720
he broke his nose and
he has a picture on his,

2064
01:56:15,721 --> 01:56:18,900
on Steve O's on Twitter with
two black eyes. By the way,

2065
01:56:18,901 --> 01:56:22,350
Steven wants to come on this podcast.
So those are how much he loves you.

2066
01:56:22,410 --> 01:56:23,580
So are you talking about,

2067
01:56:23,581 --> 01:56:27,630
we've got to do Judah Friedlander is
gonna come on to my buddy Judah contact.

2068
01:56:28,640 --> 01:56:33,330
He's hilarious. And I'm Max Kellerman
who is the, uh, HBO boxing analysts.

2069
01:56:33,331 --> 01:56:36,320
My personal favorite boxing analyst.

2070
01:56:36,450 --> 01:56:40,680
I'm next to Jim Lampley who's also those
two guys together on my two favorite

2071
01:56:40,681 --> 01:56:42,030
boxing analysts.
You know,

2072
01:56:42,031 --> 01:56:45,300
a lot of people think that because I do
the commentary for the UFC that I don't

2073
01:56:45,301 --> 01:56:47,700
like boxing. I'm a, I am
a gigantic boxing fan.

2074
01:56:47,701 --> 01:56:52,560
I've been my whole life ever since I was
a little kid and remain, and by the way,

2075
01:56:52,680 --> 01:56:56,370
so is Dana White, the president of
the NFC. He's a fucking huge, huge,

2076
01:56:56,371 --> 01:57:00,960
huge boxing fan. He bets ridiculous
amounts of money on pack, you know,

2077
01:57:00,961 --> 01:57:05,270
fights on Floyd Mayweather fights. He's
a fucking huge fan. But Max Kellerman is,

2078
01:57:05,550 --> 01:57:09,510
we're both fans of Max and he's cool
as fuck. He's a really interesting guy.

2079
01:57:09,540 --> 01:57:14,250
And he used to be a rapper, so it's going
to be, he's a white guy too. And he used,

2080
01:57:15,300 --> 01:57:18,480
he used to be a rapper and
he's really coolest fucking,

2081
01:57:18,540 --> 01:57:22,860
he's going to be on the podcast too.
But Judah Friedlander and Graham Hancock,

2082
01:57:22,861 --> 01:57:25,050
we're going to work out Graham Hancock
and the way this is going to work,

2083
01:57:25,051 --> 01:57:25,410
Brian's,

2084
01:57:25,410 --> 01:57:29,250
we're going to have to do it probably
most likely in Irvine because he's doing

2085
01:57:29,251 --> 01:57:32,610
some seminars down there and he only has
like one day off and I felt bad that it

2086
01:57:32,611 --> 01:57:36,800
was to drive all the way the fucking
bad ass spot at the Irvine. Yeah,

2087
01:57:36,820 --> 01:57:38,480
we're going to do as well.
I want to,

2088
01:57:38,500 --> 01:57:41,310
what I want to do is we're going
to have to talk after the show.

2089
01:57:41,311 --> 01:57:43,440
We're going to have to figure out a way
to make the ship mobile cause there's

2090
01:57:43,441 --> 01:57:47,820
some people that might need to come see
for the lavender hour has just innovated

2091
01:57:47,821 --> 01:57:51,070
a mobile podcast kit and I'm
sure he'd help you guys out

2092
01:57:52,820 --> 01:57:57,240
and it's got a laptop. But no, it
would be what? I want it to equipment.

2093
01:57:57,270 --> 01:58:01,530
He's like this kid's a sound engineer.
He went to college. Well listen,

2094
01:58:01,531 --> 01:58:03,550
this guy's a sound engineer.
We should listen to him.

2095
01:58:04,650 --> 01:58:07,590
The fuck burn anyway,
so we'll, we'll do that,

2096
01:58:07,591 --> 01:58:11,490
but the bottom line is that we're going
to go to Irvine and we're going to talk

2097
01:58:11,491 --> 01:58:14,160
to Graham and see if we can
make sure that this happens.

2098
01:58:14,370 --> 01:58:16,410
But Graham Hancock emailed
me out of the blue.

2099
01:58:16,411 --> 01:58:18,630
It was one of the fucking
coolest things in my life.

2100
01:58:18,870 --> 01:58:22,390
If you don't want the coolest thing so
far of this whole thing, this whole,

2101
01:58:22,530 --> 01:58:23,430
how about this?

2102
01:58:23,431 --> 01:58:28,431
The coolest thing of my entire show Biz
experience right up there with my spike

2103
01:58:28,891 --> 01:58:33,300
TV special, which is my favorite special
is Anthony Bordain doing the podcast.

2104
01:58:33,330 --> 01:58:36,450
That was pretty crazy. That was pretty
the room. That was cool as fuck.

2105
01:58:36,451 --> 01:58:37,740
I would definitely get star struck,

2106
01:58:37,741 --> 01:58:41,220
but the next coolest thing and may
be even cooler if it's possible,

2107
01:58:41,230 --> 01:58:42,250
is this Graham Hancock

2108
01:58:42,250 --> 01:58:44,500
interview. Because if you don't
know who Graham Hancock is,

2109
01:58:44,501 --> 01:58:48,490
I want you to go and research fingerprints
of the gods if you're so inclined,

2110
01:58:48,491 --> 01:58:49,390
if you're interested in this,

2111
01:58:49,690 --> 01:58:53,770
but what a fascinating guy who's basically
dedicated his whole life to the very

2112
01:58:53,771 --> 01:58:58,771
controversial and unpopular idea that
human beings have been around perhaps far

2113
01:58:59,921 --> 01:59:03,730
longer in this advanced state of
civilization that we currently enjoy.

2114
01:59:03,940 --> 01:59:08,830
Then we give credit to and then the fact
there's been some huge ups and downs

2115
01:59:08,831 --> 01:59:13,831
throughout history and it's not simply
one straight path from caveman to Wifi

2116
01:59:14,670 --> 01:59:19,670
and that along the way there's been some
disasters and that this can be clearly

2117
01:59:20,430 --> 01:59:24,670
it.
I wouldn't say that it can be proven,

2118
01:59:24,700 --> 01:59:29,680
but what I can say is enough evidence
can be brought forth that makes you

2119
01:59:29,681 --> 01:59:34,681
completely questioned the current ideas
of the timelines of human history and

2120
01:59:34,901 --> 01:59:37,030
this guy, Graham Hancock is
responsible from his book,

2121
01:59:37,031 --> 01:59:41,400
fingerprints of the Gods
completely changing the way
I look at at civilization.

2122
01:59:41,560 --> 01:59:43,000
Do you,
did you send me where you,

2123
01:59:43,001 --> 01:59:46,620
the one who sent me the fucking
video of that Mayan Pyramids,

2124
01:59:46,630 --> 01:59:51,630
they just found in Guatemala the single
largest pyramid by volume on earth.

2125
01:59:53,470 --> 01:59:57,490
And it was covered in jungle.
They didn't even know it existed.

2126
01:59:58,120 --> 02:00:01,090
Not only that, but it has
a, you know, when, when the,

2127
02:00:01,570 --> 02:00:05,030
when the Spanish came and when the, uh,
the Mayans were conquered, you know,

2128
02:00:05,040 --> 02:00:09,370
and you know, in different
parts of, uh, you know, uh,
South America, you know, diff,

2129
02:00:09,400 --> 02:00:12,370
obviously there were different
things happened, but, um,

2130
02:00:12,460 --> 02:00:16,960
the one of the things was a big issue
was the, the mind creation story was a,

2131
02:00:16,961 --> 02:00:20,290
was changed and altered and
fucked up and broken up. And it's,

2132
02:00:20,340 --> 02:00:24,760
it's very hard to find, uh, an
unedited mine creation story.

2133
02:00:24,880 --> 02:00:28,330
The pub view it's called, but
they found this and it's an, it's,

2134
02:00:28,331 --> 02:00:32,450
it's [inaudible] unedited and
it's amazing. And they're,
they're going to work on,

2135
02:00:32,451 --> 02:00:35,590
on, on, on translate again.
Now anyone in it before, like,

2136
02:00:35,591 --> 02:00:38,620
does it look like people who know? Not
only that, not only they're not in it.

2137
02:00:38,621 --> 02:00:40,270
It was completely covered.
I mean,

2138
02:00:40,400 --> 02:00:44,060
I'm sure some local people were aware of
its existence because you know when you,

2139
02:00:44,061 --> 02:00:47,080
you know, you stand, you walk around on
there and all of a sudden you're like,

2140
02:00:47,081 --> 02:00:51,250
what is this? We'll dig a little, oh,
it's a giant fucking perfectly hewn rock.

2141
02:00:51,251 --> 02:00:55,720
There's four feet wide and two feet tall.
Well obviously this didn't just happen.

2142
02:00:55,930 --> 02:00:57,760
You know, somebody made
this, who made this,

2143
02:00:58,270 --> 02:01:00,940
they just didn't know that this
mountain, you know, there's, there's,

2144
02:01:00,970 --> 02:01:04,450
they say that there's thousands of
these that they haven't discovered,

2145
02:01:04,780 --> 02:01:09,780
which is so mind boggling until you look
at the geography of South America or if

2146
02:01:10,871 --> 02:01:12,970
you take into a comp. Yeah, Google maps.

2147
02:01:13,210 --> 02:01:16,510
But if you take into account the
size of North America, South America,

2148
02:01:16,511 --> 02:01:18,650
look at Mexico. Look at like how, how,

2149
02:01:18,700 --> 02:01:22,860
how much land you're talking about
and how much of it is jungle. No,

2150
02:01:22,950 --> 02:01:25,990
they've found there was a documentary
that I was watching on Egypt where they

2151
02:01:25,991 --> 02:01:27,670
were, or excuse me, on the Amazon,

2152
02:01:27,671 --> 02:01:31,150
rather whether we're talking about all
these different structures that they're

2153
02:01:31,151 --> 02:01:33,820
finding in the jungles of civilization,

2154
02:01:33,821 --> 02:01:37,450
that they have no idea how
this civilization got there.

2155
02:01:37,540 --> 02:01:41,210
Don't know who they were dumped on,
what their origins were. Origins were,

2156
02:01:41,300 --> 02:01:44,000
but they're looking at aqua docs,
they're looking at roads,

2157
02:01:44,001 --> 02:01:47,720
they're looking at all this shit
that's just run over by the jungle.

2158
02:01:47,900 --> 02:01:49,010
And the reality is,
man,

2159
02:01:49,011 --> 02:01:52,730
if you have a fucking house and you put
this giant stone house in the middle of

2160
02:01:52,731 --> 02:01:55,070
the Amazon a hundred years from now,

2161
02:01:55,071 --> 02:01:56,630
that mother fucker is going
to be covered with [inaudible]

2162
02:01:56,670 --> 02:01:59,430
tree. Yeah, man, there's a
documentary. I know, we claim it.

2163
02:01:59,460 --> 02:02:02,190
There's a document or a
Netflix you can watch now.

2164
02:02:02,191 --> 02:02:06,450
I can't remember the name of it, but I'm
taking these fucking Alpha brain pills.

2165
02:02:06,451 --> 02:02:10,070
You take it on backwards. I Google
it, but I mean, what is it about,

2166
02:02:10,090 --> 02:02:11,880
so what it's about is this side.
Yeah,

2167
02:02:11,881 --> 02:02:15,240
it's an explorer who was
searching for this a theme,

2168
02:02:15,310 --> 02:02:18,000
the last city that existed
in the middle of the Amazon.

2169
02:02:18,001 --> 02:02:20,430
It might be that pyramid that they found.

2170
02:02:20,610 --> 02:02:25,610
He was looking for it based on like some
old scrolls in this like library that

2171
02:02:25,651 --> 02:02:28,800
he found and he was like a
theosophist cause the theosophists.

2172
02:02:28,801 --> 02:02:31,980
We're really into this idea
that there's still existed,

2173
02:02:31,981 --> 02:02:36,090
advanced civilizations on this planet
that had closed themselves off to the rest

2174
02:02:36,091 --> 02:02:37,050
of human society.

2175
02:02:37,051 --> 02:02:40,230
And he thought you would find a place
where people were still living there,

2176
02:02:40,470 --> 02:02:43,560
but he went down into the Amazon
and just basically vanished.

2177
02:02:44,200 --> 02:02:48,000
Save the secrets of the dead last Amazon.
Yeah.

2178
02:02:48,070 --> 02:02:53,070
Be a PBS documentary that's on Netflix
called the secrets of the dead set out to

2179
02:02:53,671 --> 02:02:57,460
find the fabled lost city of
z. That's it. Yeah. Yeah. And,

2180
02:02:57,580 --> 02:02:59,800
and the Amazon in 1925.
Yeah.

2181
02:02:59,920 --> 02:03:03,600
It led to a mysterious disappearance was
actually a movie. It's a, it's a, it's an,

2182
02:03:03,760 --> 02:03:07,410
it's a drama. There's a documentary too.
Oh wait, no, it is a document. I'm sorry,

2183
02:03:07,411 --> 02:03:11,510
the late Liev Schreiber is apparently
the, um, I looked at that author, I mean,

2184
02:03:11,520 --> 02:03:14,850
or that actor, I assumed that he was an
actor. He's actually the narrator of it.

2185
02:03:15,030 --> 02:03:15,980
Yeah.
But there,

2186
02:03:16,140 --> 02:03:19,860
it was like a big news story because
he was a famous explorer that vanished.

2187
02:03:20,070 --> 02:03:22,020
And it was weird that you would
have watched that shit tonight.

2188
02:03:22,230 --> 02:03:26,280
It's really fucking cool, man. But they,
you know, he thought that they would,

2189
02:03:26,340 --> 02:03:28,800
there would actually be
people living there who were,

2190
02:03:28,830 --> 02:03:32,220
who would give him like it
was a mystical quest for him.

2191
02:03:32,221 --> 02:03:35,820
Like he really thought that there was
going to be this advanced civilization is

2192
02:03:35,821 --> 02:03:40,380
still in existence. There was somehow
going to transmit this information to him,

2193
02:03:40,650 --> 02:03:43,890
which some people still believe, you know,
there's like the hollow earth theory,

2194
02:03:43,891 --> 02:03:47,490
the idea that like the
Shambala exists in the Arctic.

2195
02:03:47,491 --> 02:03:51,000
If you ever seen that shit no. That
you've never seen like in the North Pole,

2196
02:03:51,001 --> 02:03:51,570
the ideas

2197
02:03:51,570 --> 02:03:55,440
hold on a second. This secrets of the
dead. Apparently it's a whole series.

2198
02:03:55,820 --> 02:04:00,300
Oh Shit. Bunch of them. And they're
available online secrets of the dead.

2199
02:04:00,301 --> 02:04:03,750
China's terracotta warrior. You,
me, and you know what that is? Yeah.

2200
02:04:03,900 --> 02:04:05,220
Well they found these fucking,

2201
02:04:05,221 --> 02:04:09,960
this army of terracotta soldiers like
buried for thousands of years or however

2202
02:04:10,290 --> 02:04:14,760
long it was, secrets of
dead. Her kilania uncovered.

2203
02:04:14,761 --> 02:04:17,220
I don't know what that is.
Secrets of the dead silver pharaoh,

2204
02:04:17,221 --> 02:04:21,420
secrets of dead world's biggest bomb
secrets or the dead, the Dead Sea Scrolls.

2205
02:04:21,660 --> 02:04:26,660
One Star on Amazon dog. It can't be
too good sequence. You get one star.

2206
02:04:26,820 --> 02:04:27,300
No,
no.

2207
02:04:27,300 --> 02:04:32,300
Churchill's deadly decision is got four
stars maybe that maybe has the same sort

2208
02:04:33,241 --> 02:04:38,070
of lost in the Amazon only has
two stars. I wasn't the, well you

2209
02:04:38,070 --> 02:04:40,680
know what man, who knows?
One customer review.

2210
02:04:40,681 --> 02:04:45,470
Maybe you got one current who reviewed
it and didn't like it. But um,

2211
02:04:45,780 --> 02:04:49,890
anyway, the point is that these, uh,
this, this discovery in Guatemala,

2212
02:04:50,040 --> 02:04:52,370
I believe they discovered it in 2009.
Um,

2213
02:04:52,470 --> 02:04:56,160
and it's just sort of being publicized
today and it made its way through Twitter.

2214
02:04:56,161 --> 02:04:59,580
But somebody said to me on Twitter when
I retweeted it or wherever the hell

2215
02:04:59,581 --> 02:05:03,390
happened, he said, this is from 2009. I'm
like, you know, he's like, just old shit.

2216
02:05:03,450 --> 02:05:05,670
The Guy said this old shed. I'm like,
oh my God, there's 24 months ago.

2217
02:05:06,870 --> 02:05:10,290
We're talking about some shit that's
been buried without human beings ever

2218
02:05:10,291 --> 02:05:15,090
finding it for fucking thousands of years.
No one knew it was there. You know, the,

2219
02:05:15,180 --> 02:05:18,210
the unedited Mayan creation story.

2220
02:05:18,900 --> 02:05:22,410
Do they still have, she stole my voice
on Netflix not to change the subject.

2221
02:05:22,411 --> 02:05:26,850
And what is that? It's a documentary about
lesbian rape. I recommend Grand Canyon.

2222
02:05:28,380 --> 02:05:31,590
It's like lesbians raping each
other. They, oh, no way. Yeah.

2223
02:05:31,591 --> 02:05:33,130
They like lesbians rape each other.

2224
02:05:33,150 --> 02:05:37,250
Will they just fucking forced scissors
on each other? Yeah. The idea is you,

2225
02:05:37,350 --> 02:05:41,720
it's that you mount someone's face
and face. This is not on Facebook.

2226
02:05:41,721 --> 02:05:45,310
Fuck them bro. They took it off.
Did you find it? No, it's a,

2227
02:05:45,350 --> 02:05:49,430
it's not on the IMD beating. She stole
my voice on Netflix. I was talking to

2228
02:05:49,470 --> 02:05:52,590
don't get in the car on the way here.
I watched, uh, Grand Canyon recently.

2229
02:05:52,591 --> 02:05:55,620
Do you remember Grand Canyon?
Yeah, we talked about this. Yeah.

2230
02:05:55,650 --> 02:06:00,180
It's weird how time has passed
since that movie came out.

2231
02:06:00,440 --> 02:06:04,230
Uh, and how we don't, we don't
buy it anymore. We're, we're,

2232
02:06:04,231 --> 02:06:08,760
we're way more intelligent than 1993
or whenever that movie came out because

2233
02:06:08,761 --> 02:06:10,410
that movie and the first hour,

2234
02:06:10,620 --> 02:06:15,300
15 things happen in one day
almost to all these same people.

2235
02:06:15,420 --> 02:06:16,380
Like what is it fucking

2236
02:06:16,540 --> 02:06:18,080
well worth the unconnected though.

2237
02:06:18,081 --> 02:06:20,030
There were a bunch of different things
to happen in two people didn't even know

2238
02:06:20,270 --> 02:06:24,500
kind of, but yet there was also like,
all right, the husband, you almost got,

2239
02:06:24,520 --> 02:06:26,300
you know,
mugged in his car,

2240
02:06:26,301 --> 02:06:30,830
got stolen and then the next morning his
wife is walking and found a baby in a

2241
02:06:30,831 --> 02:06:35,090
Bush and then like, you know, then his
secretary or they connected though.

2242
02:06:35,150 --> 02:06:39,260
Or are they just like, it's all like
crazy shit happened in like one day.

2243
02:06:39,300 --> 02:06:42,590
Like it's so ridiculous now you kind
of watching her like this seems pretty

2244
02:06:42,591 --> 02:06:44,710
extreme, you know, for one day.

2245
02:06:45,030 --> 02:06:48,870
Yeah. This lesbian and Rafe movie gets
terrible reviews. Oh, it's terrible.

2246
02:06:49,280 --> 02:06:50,790
Horrible documentary.

2247
02:06:51,080 --> 02:06:55,080
Or should have known there were views
of this movie before I purchased it.

2248
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:57,780
No,
it's really so funny.

2249
02:06:57,781 --> 02:07:01,110
It's the worst documentary you'll ever
see because really all it is is like a

2250
02:07:01,111 --> 02:07:04,360
porn that somebody wanted to call
it documentary cause it's real.

2251
02:07:04,430 --> 02:07:08,480
It's like reenactments of
what girls like, yeah. Yeah.

2252
02:07:08,850 --> 02:07:13,260
It's like just all these reenactments
of lesbian sitting, it's just niches.

2253
02:07:13,261 --> 02:07:16,590
Reenactments of like some bloods being
like sitting on another woman's face.

2254
02:07:16,591 --> 02:07:21,480
He was like, no, no, I can't get you off
exactly that. Lesbians rape each other.

2255
02:07:21,510 --> 02:07:23,130
Well I guess so man.

2256
02:07:24,050 --> 02:07:26,190
Brilliant. Yeah, he's dead on. It's weird.

2257
02:07:26,191 --> 02:07:28,470
It's freaky that you know
how to do it so well,

2258
02:07:28,710 --> 02:07:29,640
wait a minute.
Do you know

2259
02:07:29,850 --> 02:07:34,020
just a real high, he doesn't,
Brian knows about that.

2260
02:07:34,260 --> 02:07:36,100
What do you think happens?
What do you think

2261
02:07:36,100 --> 02:07:40,030
it happens? More ready? Lesbian
rape or Chinese Nascar drivers.

2262
02:07:46,340 --> 02:07:47,950
I shouldn't be in a fucking Chinese dude.

2263
02:07:47,951 --> 02:07:50,800
He just really loves cars and you get
into Nascar and you have to hang out with

2264
02:07:50,801 --> 02:07:54,100
those assholes. Well can
you, hey man, you want to,

2265
02:07:54,101 --> 02:07:56,710
we'll blows up some Chinese
food before the next lab.

2266
02:08:02,120 --> 02:08:04,550
Oh you know who wants to come on the
podcast? I totally forgot about this kid.

2267
02:08:04,580 --> 02:08:09,320
Dr Ken. Doctor Ken [inaudible].
He's great. Really? Some zookeeper.

2268
02:08:09,321 --> 02:08:11,920
And he was talking, he hang over. Yeah,

2269
02:08:11,930 --> 02:08:15,650
he saw Joey d is the other day and he
wants to come on and he's hilarious.

2270
02:08:15,830 --> 02:08:19,090
Norton's in town right now and we should
be my call. Yeah. Well I'm, we're all,

2271
02:08:19,110 --> 02:08:24,020
Duncan and I are only in town for a couple
of days cause we gotta get ourselves

2272
02:08:24,021 --> 02:08:27,200
over the knowledge.
We're going to do the house of Blues.

2273
02:08:27,201 --> 02:08:28,630
It's fucking Friday night and that

2274
02:08:28,730 --> 02:08:32,680
solve that bitches crazy.
Ooh,

2275
02:08:32,960 --> 02:08:34,810
I can't wait.
But we're also right,

2276
02:08:34,940 --> 02:08:38,450
they're going to be at the
UFC Ellenberger versus um, uh,

2277
02:08:38,810 --> 02:08:40,440
Jake shields this side,
this

2278
02:08:41,630 --> 02:08:44,790
interesting.
I know last time portraying Jay,

2279
02:08:45,480 --> 02:08:46,313
well,
you know,

2280
02:08:46,850 --> 02:08:50,970
people who don't know Jake Shields Dad
died and he died just a couple of weeks

2281
02:08:50,970 --> 02:08:54,000
ago and it's, you know what, I'm
in Jake, his dad was his manager.

2282
02:08:54,070 --> 02:08:58,200
His Dad is like super duper
close to him and you know,

2283
02:08:58,201 --> 02:09:03,120
they grew up whereas dad home schooled
him in the mountains. So I mean this is,

2284
02:09:03,210 --> 02:09:06,780
I mean, I mean everybody's relationship
to their father except mine.

2285
02:09:06,781 --> 02:09:11,290
Cause I don't know that Douche,
everybody's relationship
is close, you know,

2286
02:09:11,291 --> 02:09:12,600
and not everybody's for a lot of people's,

2287
02:09:12,601 --> 02:09:17,540
Jake shields was particularly close to
his dad. So, you know, it's for him to,

2288
02:09:17,541 --> 02:09:20,970
uh, to fight just a couple of weeks
after his dad died. It's devastating.

2289
02:09:21,180 --> 02:09:24,240
And it's down. I was like pretty healthy.
His Dad, his dad died in his sleep.

2290
02:09:24,600 --> 02:09:27,990
His Dad was a vegetarian. I mean he
grew up with, Jake is a vegetarian.

2291
02:09:27,991 --> 02:09:32,670
Jay Jay grew up vegetarian. He only gets
his animal protein from eggs, you know,

2292
02:09:32,671 --> 02:09:33,750
he just believes that,
uh,

2293
02:09:33,810 --> 02:09:37,920
that factory farming is fucked up
and he would actually eat food,

2294
02:09:38,340 --> 02:09:40,470
animal food as long as it
was hunted, you know, like,

2295
02:09:40,600 --> 02:09:43,270
ah, did food is like, like, like,

2296
02:09:43,271 --> 02:09:46,450
like a Kevin Smith was saying the other
day how like just like that everything

2297
02:09:46,451 --> 02:09:50,710
can fucking change. You know, you
could wake up and then I have a stroke.

2298
02:09:51,400 --> 02:09:52,233
I never walk again.

2299
02:09:52,260 --> 02:09:57,080
We have to, we have to somehow or another
balance, the idea of ambition and,

2300
02:09:57,081 --> 02:10:02,010
and, and, and, and planning for the
future with enjoying the present.

2301
02:10:02,011 --> 02:10:06,180
And that's the grand dance that everybody
has to go through this so difficult to

2302
02:10:06,181 --> 02:10:10,740
master. And I've, I still
don't have it down. No one, no,

2303
02:10:10,741 --> 02:10:12,360
I don't think anyone ever has it down,

2304
02:10:12,361 --> 02:10:15,030
but I'm way better at it now than
I ever was when I was younger.

2305
02:10:15,360 --> 02:10:18,990
I'm way better at it and I can offer
some insight and here's the number one

2306
02:10:18,991 --> 02:10:23,730
piece of inside that I can offer that he
be reckless. I'm reckless. I'm a little,

2307
02:10:23,760 --> 02:10:26,670
I'm a little bit reckless,
but I'm also really nice.

2308
02:10:26,760 --> 02:10:30,810
I tried to write as nice as
I can, you know, and I'm not,
you know, people say, Oh,

2309
02:10:30,811 --> 02:10:34,010
I'm a Joe Rogan, who's a dick.
A guarantee. You're me first

2310
02:10:34,100 --> 02:10:35,120
for sure.
You know,

2311
02:10:35,121 --> 02:10:37,640
and you might've been a deck because
you were nervous or you might've been in

2312
02:10:37,641 --> 02:10:41,450
debt because you were drunk, but if you're
nice to me, I can't be not nice to you.

2313
02:10:41,451 --> 02:10:45,440
It is impossible. I am.
I grew up, I, I've, I've,

2314
02:10:45,441 --> 02:10:50,000
I've been a nice person as long as I've
been capable of being a nice person to

2315
02:10:50,050 --> 02:10:52,820
know. Don't wear a condom.
What are you saying?

2316
02:10:52,880 --> 02:10:55,850
I'm just saying do everything exactly
opposite of what you're told him to do.

2317
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:59,120
Well, I don't know if that's the
truth. I don't know if that's the case.

2318
02:10:59,150 --> 02:11:04,010
It's like you have to, because when
you start talking about sex, okay.

2319
02:11:04,280 --> 02:11:08,270
And you say don't work on them, you
know, sex to me is just like doing drugs.

2320
02:11:08,300 --> 02:11:11,990
Natural. It's fine. Yes is
natural. It's fun. But you can,

2321
02:11:12,020 --> 02:11:15,890
you can get caught up in it
and you can get fucking crazy.
Yeah. And it can, it is,

2322
02:11:15,920 --> 02:11:18,500
it has just as much of a poll as,
as,

2323
02:11:18,560 --> 02:11:21,110
as any other kind of crazy
psychological addiction,

2324
02:11:21,111 --> 02:11:22,340
whether it's gambling or anything like,

2325
02:11:22,470 --> 02:11:25,590
but Brian, you don't really mean don't
wear a condom. Yeah, I do. It feels good.

2326
02:11:25,591 --> 02:11:29,700
It feels way better now I'm on them
for the first month or two and then you

2327
02:11:29,701 --> 02:11:31,650
figure out the girl enough.
No side.

2328
02:11:31,651 --> 02:11:35,940
If you want to or need an abortion and
your life to appreciate the little things

2329
02:11:35,941 --> 02:11:40,320
can go wrong. It makes you good
together. Closer. A little horror story.

2330
02:11:40,321 --> 02:11:44,270
I'll tell you a little horror
story. I would love to hear it. Um,

2331
02:11:44,660 --> 02:11:48,390
there's someone that I know,
there is someone that I know who got a,

2332
02:11:48,570 --> 02:11:53,230
who got a waitress pregnant and we
just, what did she work? She worked.

2333
02:11:53,520 --> 02:11:56,770
She just girl, why did you have
to make her a waitress? Yeah,

2334
02:11:57,420 --> 02:11:59,100
because he was a bartender or something.
I don't know.

2335
02:11:59,101 --> 02:12:01,560
Cause they both like they worked at
the same place, so it's like, okay,

2336
02:12:01,710 --> 02:12:03,150
so they worked together at this place.

2337
02:12:04,200 --> 02:12:06,900
So I'm just going reverse sexism on.
Yeah.

2338
02:12:06,980 --> 02:12:10,050
I don't know why I said I don't mean
to leave a people. I'm so sorry.

2339
02:12:10,051 --> 02:12:14,970
Stop Lesbian rape. They, they uh,
so they um, they, they ended up,

2340
02:12:15,420 --> 02:12:16,230
uh,

2341
02:12:16,230 --> 02:12:21,210
he ended up putting his pee pee inside
of her and the guess what happened?

2342
02:12:21,480 --> 02:12:24,510
She got pregnant. You should have kept
the cell phone in his pocket. Yeah.

2343
02:12:24,511 --> 02:12:29,490
But yeah, he should have. And guess what?
She doesn't want to fucking abortion. No,

2344
02:12:29,491 --> 02:12:30,870
this is like awesome.
This is,

2345
02:12:31,560 --> 02:12:35,310
this is a one night stand
now he's a daddy. Awesome.

2346
02:12:35,340 --> 02:12:40,120
But it's with someone that he just
fucked one night and, and like,

2347
02:12:40,140 --> 02:12:44,940
yeah, it's like now he's legally bound
for the rest of his life to this,

2348
02:12:45,120 --> 02:12:47,880
to this, to his kid. He
didn't wait the two month ago.

2349
02:12:47,910 --> 02:12:49,350
You got to wear a fucking condom.

2350
02:12:49,351 --> 02:12:52,090
You're crazy if you don't work on
them for two months. Yeah. But you

2351
02:12:52,090 --> 02:12:55,620
also got to fuck people that you like.
Yeah. Don't, yeah. No, it's hard.

2352
02:12:55,690 --> 02:12:58,420
It's hard to say because you want to fuck
anybody want to give up the pussy at a

2353
02:12:58,421 --> 02:13:01,870
certain point in time, pussy is like
water and you're living in a desert. Okay,

2354
02:13:02,150 --> 02:13:06,360
so you weren't going to get him.
You know, it's only until you,

2355
02:13:06,361 --> 02:13:09,790
you live by a fucking stream.
They could drink water every day.

2356
02:13:09,791 --> 02:13:12,100
Can you see the forest for the trees?

2357
02:13:12,280 --> 02:13:17,280
Because otherwise your entire waking life
is dedicated to getting this resource

2358
02:13:17,621 --> 02:13:20,170
that is fucking water or pussy.
Either one.

2359
02:13:20,171 --> 02:13:22,660
They're interchangeable and
when there are plentiful,

2360
02:13:22,661 --> 02:13:25,780
then you could see them for what they
truly are. You know, and you know,

2361
02:13:25,781 --> 02:13:28,900
it doesn't necessarily mean that you
have to get spoiled does necessarily mean

2362
02:13:28,901 --> 02:13:32,010
that you have to get that.
You know, you, you don't it,

2363
02:13:32,040 --> 02:13:36,390
you should totally appreciate every
single one of the biological pleasures of

2364
02:13:36,391 --> 02:13:37,050
existence.

2365
02:13:37,050 --> 02:13:40,500
One of the reasons why I'm a huge fan
of Anthony Bourdain is cause he calls

2366
02:13:40,501 --> 02:13:43,770
himself an enthusiast, but he
is a chef and he enjoys, he,

2367
02:13:43,771 --> 02:13:48,771
he like really shows how much joy you
can get in eating great food during the

2368
02:13:49,081 --> 02:13:53,460
whole fact that the feeling of taste and
the feeling of pleasure and the feeling

2369
02:13:53,461 --> 02:13:57,930
of friendship. I like drinking wine.
I like smoking weed. I like going to,

2370
02:13:58,080 --> 02:14:03,000
I like seeing fun movies.
I like listening to great music.

2371
02:14:03,001 --> 02:14:07,830
You know, I like being, I like being
inundated by great feeling shit. You know,

2372
02:14:07,950 --> 02:14:10,440
I think that's, it's important
to wrap our heads around that.

2373
02:14:10,490 --> 02:14:14,660
Well, I mean, if you can like accept it,
it's just like the, there's uh, you know,

2374
02:14:14,830 --> 02:14:19,540
me and my friend were just
talking about this, uh, uh,
sorry, the one of the excess,

2375
02:14:19,550 --> 02:14:24,340
this French existentialist philosopher
and like how they have the existential is

2376
02:14:24,341 --> 02:14:28,040
basically I have this idea where it's
like, yeah, you can fucking, you know,

2377
02:14:28,041 --> 02:14:31,370
enjoy reality and get caught up and
being an enthusiast or whatever.

2378
02:14:31,520 --> 02:14:34,700
But the depths of it, it's just pure
absurdity. There's no meaning behind it.

2379
02:14:34,701 --> 02:14:39,200
There's no meaning to life. It's like
just this empty meaning was vortex.

2380
02:14:39,320 --> 02:14:42,800
So like, you know, for example, like when
you see your dog dry hump, another dog,

2381
02:14:43,040 --> 02:14:45,650
you know, you see the dog dry hump
and you're, you kind of watch it.

2382
02:14:45,651 --> 02:14:49,080
It's kind of funny, but it's like
you're, you're watching a, uh,

2383
02:14:49,110 --> 02:14:51,770
an instinctual trigger,
you know,

2384
02:14:51,771 --> 02:14:53,930
go through the thing and it
just acts this thing out.

2385
02:14:54,140 --> 02:14:58,340
And then when you find yourself humping
somebody that you just met and you

2386
02:14:58,341 --> 02:14:59,110
realize you're going yeah,

2387
02:14:59,110 --> 02:15:02,290
to the same extent, instinctual
trigger and you're like, ah, fuck,

2388
02:15:04,330 --> 02:15:08,050
same thing. No meaning to this.
No meaning, this is just a,

2389
02:15:08,410 --> 02:15:13,410
I've triggered a series of responses
in my primate brain that is wanting to

2390
02:15:13,751 --> 02:15:17,860
reproduce once, once I come, I'm going
to go right back into this state.

2391
02:15:18,070 --> 02:15:21,730
And that's absurdity. That's a
form of absurdity. I got an answer.

2392
02:15:21,731 --> 02:15:26,400
A question for you Brian, because I,

2393
02:15:27,540 --> 02:15:30,400
it's so funny you just said that cause
I just thought it's something that the

2394
02:15:30,401 --> 02:15:34,050
other day, like you ever scratch
a cats but, and they do that dude,

2395
02:15:34,051 --> 02:15:36,920
that dude I think where they're just like,
yeah,

2396
02:15:37,140 --> 02:15:40,960
ever fucked a girl and seen her do
the exact same thing. It's creepy.

2397
02:15:41,300 --> 02:15:45,420
It's almost exactly the same. Yeah,
it's cause they turned to me and Shane,

2398
02:15:45,450 --> 02:15:46,510
you know,
fucking them hard enough.

2399
02:15:46,511 --> 02:15:49,280
You've got to fuck them to the
point where they're nervous. No body

2400
02:15:51,610 --> 02:15:54,440
circuiting. I think that's what it
is. I need to buy I fuck up dude.

2401
02:15:55,130 --> 02:15:58,350
I fuck 'em they get nervous
for an audition or is, what?

2402
02:15:58,351 --> 02:16:01,870
Are they nervous for them? And
that's a lot of pressure, son.

2403
02:16:02,530 --> 02:16:07,530
As 185 pounds of Alpha and
loads in your body making grunt.

2404
02:16:08,590 --> 02:16:10,810
No, listen, stop. Like
I'll make anybody nervous.

2405
02:16:11,070 --> 02:16:14,400
Imagine a girl on top of you that's way
bigger than you. And while she's talking,

2406
02:16:14,401 --> 02:16:15,890
you should just start fucking hitting you.
Yeah.

2407
02:16:16,410 --> 02:16:18,960
Fucking bitch.
You can fuck me.

2408
02:16:19,890 --> 02:16:22,440
Could you imagine being a situation
where you girl can kick your ass?

2409
02:16:22,560 --> 02:16:26,100
Have you ever been there like
Bourdain's? I don't think so. Well,

2410
02:16:26,101 --> 02:16:30,340
I don't think board wife can kick
his ass. I'm still, he's still a man

2411
02:16:30,340 --> 02:16:34,230
and she's still anybody
on enough adrenaline. Eh,

2412
02:16:34,240 --> 02:16:35,710
Anthony Bourdain been around the world.

2413
02:16:35,800 --> 02:16:39,430
I guarantee you he probably
has no endurance, but he's,

2414
02:16:39,490 --> 02:16:44,410
he knows how to throw a straight right
dirty boxing match. If you have a hammer,

2415
02:16:44,620 --> 02:16:47,980
if you have a hammer in your house
and you sleep next to somebody,

2416
02:16:48,010 --> 02:16:51,610
they can kick your ass no matter who
they are, what they can slam it. Yeah.

2417
02:16:51,620 --> 02:16:54,850
They can slam the hammer on your
fucking face while you're sleeping.

2418
02:16:55,190 --> 02:16:58,080
If they catch you off guard. Yeah,
they can catch you off guard. Right?

2419
02:16:58,090 --> 02:16:59,800
So do you want to get
gay? It's like, yeah.

2420
02:17:00,200 --> 02:17:03,410
This videos online of girls
sucker punching guys and
knocking them unconscious.

2421
02:17:03,411 --> 02:17:06,770
There's a bunch of them. I mean, it's
hilarious. The sucker punch a guy.

2422
02:17:06,771 --> 02:17:07,950
You know what? A sucker punches. Yeah,

2423
02:17:08,040 --> 02:17:10,280
I know what a sucker punches
a lot of videos of girls,

2424
02:17:10,281 --> 02:17:13,790
sucker punching guys online.
It's a great fetish. Listen man,

2425
02:17:13,791 --> 02:17:17,190
it's a fucking wide world out there.
A lot of fucking things happen.

2426
02:17:17,270 --> 02:17:18,500
A lot of cross streets,

2427
02:17:18,650 --> 02:17:22,760
a lot of one thing intersects with
this thing when it wasn't prepared.

2428
02:17:22,960 --> 02:17:23,900
And next thing you know,

2429
02:17:24,290 --> 02:17:28,400
fucking coked up girl punches a drunk
guy in the John knocks him unconscious.

2430
02:17:28,670 --> 02:17:29,503
It happens all over the

2431
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,640
[inaudible].
It's like MMA spanking.

2432
02:17:32,950 --> 02:17:35,360
There was a girl that used to work
for a buddy of mine. She was, uh,

2433
02:17:35,470 --> 02:17:39,910
my friend's assistant and she could
punch so fucking hard. She was nice.

2434
02:17:39,911 --> 02:17:42,130
I mean she wouldn't have ever
punched anybody, but she was like,

2435
02:17:42,160 --> 02:17:44,800
I could punch hard. And I was like,
all right, whatever. You know,

2436
02:17:44,801 --> 02:17:49,300
I'm fucking do commentary for the UFC.
You could punch hard. There's some people,

2437
02:17:49,301 --> 02:17:53,740
man, there's some people that
for whatever fucking reason,

2438
02:17:54,010 --> 02:17:58,900
they got this crazy Tommy Hearns punch.
It's a weird thing man. Cause I've,

2439
02:17:58,901 --> 02:18:02,830
I've experienced this since I was a
child since I first started doing martial

2440
02:18:02,831 --> 02:18:05,740
arts. Every now and then you'll
come across some guy who can just,

2441
02:18:07,510 --> 02:18:11,440
he gets so fucking hard. You're like,
where is that coming from? Does he make?

2442
02:18:11,441 --> 02:18:14,980
He's 160 pounds. Does it make
sense? But when he hits the bag,

2443
02:18:14,981 --> 02:18:16,930
the bag just moves more than anybody else.

2444
02:18:17,240 --> 02:18:19,090
There was this fucking check
and she was a regular girl.

2445
02:18:19,091 --> 02:18:22,600
She was like 23 years old. She was my
friend's assistant and she was like,

2446
02:18:22,630 --> 02:18:26,620
I can pass. I can punch. Okay. She's
like, put your hand up. I put my hand up.

2447
02:18:26,621 --> 02:18:30,460
She goes,
she hit me and I thought about my face.

2448
02:18:30,790 --> 02:18:33,670
She hit my hand and my hand was stinging.
Fuck.

2449
02:18:33,820 --> 02:18:38,230
And she turned her shoulder into it and
through her fucking weight into it and

2450
02:18:38,260 --> 02:18:40,990
she went to knuckles for,
I go, who the fuck taught?

2451
02:18:40,991 --> 02:18:44,020
You had a punch like that and don't like
her dad taught her how to punch people

2452
02:18:44,021 --> 02:18:46,970
and Shit, but I was like, man, if
that check punches you in the face,

2453
02:18:46,971 --> 02:18:50,620
she will knock you the fuck out. Right?
Here's a, if you're not ready for it,

2454
02:18:50,890 --> 02:18:54,880
it only takes a certain amount of
pressure to hit your jaw at a certain way.

2455
02:18:55,150 --> 02:18:58,750
Your legs just go. I've seen
it. I seen him in person.

2456
02:18:58,751 --> 02:19:02,800
I've seen it in fights. I've seen it
in bars, I've seen it all my life.

2457
02:19:02,950 --> 02:19:06,850
It's a weird phenomenon. If you
don't get the job, why the job?

2458
02:19:06,880 --> 02:19:10,570
What is in that cluster of,
it's a design flaw, design flaw,

2459
02:19:10,571 --> 02:19:13,990
complete design power off
button. Well, this is what it is.

2460
02:19:14,020 --> 02:19:18,340
Your brain is this fucking
central core of information,

2461
02:19:18,341 --> 02:19:21,430
of movement, of
everything. All the design,

2462
02:19:21,550 --> 02:19:24,220
all the direction comes from this spot.
Well,

2463
02:19:24,460 --> 02:19:28,100
what you are your body is
is like a fucking a house

2464
02:19:28,100 --> 02:19:31,100
that has a bunch of ethernet cables in it.
You know,

2465
02:19:31,160 --> 02:19:34,880
and you want to get Internet to your toes.
We've got to run wines.

2466
02:19:35,050 --> 02:19:37,910
You got to run nerves through
your whole situation. Well,

2467
02:19:37,911 --> 02:19:42,350
you also have this thing where you have,
you have to chew food, supply the body.

2468
02:19:42,620 --> 02:19:44,900
So we'll, how do we do this? Well, we're
going to have something that moves.

2469
02:19:44,901 --> 02:19:48,110
We're going to have something that moves
and it's going to be hard and boney and

2470
02:19:48,111 --> 02:19:53,030
it's going to be right in front of
all the chords. We have no choice.

2471
02:19:53,060 --> 02:19:56,030
That's the design and we just got to hope
that the human doesn't get hit on the

2472
02:19:56,031 --> 02:20:00,830
job bone and it doesn't compress all
those nerves that send the signals down to

2473
02:20:00,831 --> 02:20:04,120
all the limbs because if
it does, everything shuts
off. It's right here, right?

2474
02:20:04,130 --> 02:20:07,270
That's that. They call that John? No,
no, no. It's the actual jaw itself.

2475
02:20:07,271 --> 02:20:10,070
Is that what they call the button?
Yes. What I call the button.

2476
02:20:10,071 --> 02:20:14,780
It's the movement of the jaw. I got
the apple shop presses into the cord.

2477
02:20:14,980 --> 02:20:18,410
Well, I don't listen. When I say
precedent, the court will have,

2478
02:20:18,680 --> 02:20:22,670
what the fuck do I know is inside my neck?
It could be all elves,

2479
02:20:23,110 --> 02:20:24,190
gummy bears

2480
02:20:26,190 --> 02:20:30,080
could be all sparkly fairy dust that
comes out and you cut my throat.

2481
02:20:30,081 --> 02:20:34,100
I'm just guessing.
But the idea that I have,

2482
02:20:34,190 --> 02:20:38,270
I've had explained to
me is that the nerves,

2483
02:20:38,360 --> 02:20:43,130
when you punch a person on the jaw that
their job on slams into the cluster of

2484
02:20:43,131 --> 02:20:46,760
nerves behind them and it just causes
this big electrical short circuit

2485
02:20:47,060 --> 02:20:51,110
depending on a bunch of different things
to printing on your determination,

2486
02:20:51,170 --> 02:20:54,470
depending on your anger,
your adrenaline level had your focus,

2487
02:20:54,471 --> 02:20:57,890
whether or not you saw this coming,
whether or not you've been punched before,

2488
02:20:57,891 --> 02:21:01,400
you know how to react to it or
how to stay calm under pressure.

2489
02:21:01,460 --> 02:21:03,080
And depending on the physiological,

2490
02:21:03,140 --> 02:21:08,130
the physiological design of your actual
frame, different body structures have to,

2491
02:21:08,140 --> 02:21:11,240
can take a different load of impact.
You know,

2492
02:21:11,360 --> 02:21:15,350
like large jaws and big
David to luck looking faces.

2493
02:21:15,470 --> 02:21:18,770
There was a guy named David too. I was
still is a very dangerous heavyweight.

2494
02:21:18,771 --> 02:21:23,000
Boxers is a Samoan dude. Tanga Dude,
whatever the fuck he is, he's anyways,

2495
02:21:23,060 --> 02:21:25,910
whatever he is, I think believe
is smaller. The bad ass boxer.

2496
02:21:25,911 --> 02:21:29,390
And one of the things about him, it says
this mother fucker can take a punch man,

2497
02:21:29,570 --> 02:21:31,310
you can hit David [inaudible] with a bomb.

2498
02:21:31,311 --> 02:21:35,510
He fought Lennox Lewis and Lennox Lewis
connected with straight right hands.

2499
02:21:35,511 --> 02:21:39,590
It just would have put normal
men on the moon and just boom,

2500
02:21:39,620 --> 02:21:42,650
hits him and he can take it. He
just doesn't go out. He's had,

2501
02:21:42,740 --> 02:21:47,300
he's got an incredible job on top of
big, big punching power. So there's that.

2502
02:21:47,450 --> 02:21:50,600
There's the, the shape of your
frame, the shape of your body,

2503
02:21:50,601 --> 02:21:53,690
the thickness of your tendons
and chords. And then, you know,

2504
02:21:53,691 --> 02:21:56,860
then there's just the fucking design flaw.
The jaw goes to the,

2505
02:21:57,310 --> 02:22:01,010
the cluster of nerves and
depending on your sensitivity,

2506
02:22:01,040 --> 02:22:02,540
some people just shut right off.

2507
02:22:02,570 --> 02:22:05,720
There's some dudes that they just have a
glass jaw man and all you have to do is

2508
02:22:05,721 --> 02:22:08,710
get to their jaw and it's fun
and doesn't have, you know,

2509
02:22:08,780 --> 02:22:10,640
there's nothing I can do to strengthen.
I mean,

2510
02:22:10,641 --> 02:22:14,120
they get toughen it up a little bit.
Who's exercises dude's do,

2511
02:22:14,121 --> 02:22:18,170
where they fucking lift weights with their
jaws. They pull cords with their jaws.

2512
02:22:18,850 --> 02:22:22,670
They suck a lot of caulk. They,
they tried to suck Bryan Cocke.

2513
02:22:22,700 --> 02:22:26,150
They just hold them down. There's, um,

2514
02:22:26,220 --> 02:22:27,750
there's things that I've seen guys do.

2515
02:22:27,751 --> 02:22:30,330
Gerry Cooney who was doing it once in
this video I watched the first time I ever

2516
02:22:30,331 --> 02:22:31,610
saw, we had like, oh,

2517
02:22:31,630 --> 02:22:35,400
it's almost like a bungee cord and all
those tape inside his jaw and he was

2518
02:22:35,401 --> 02:22:39,350
biting it.
It's change a fucking pulling jaw,

2519
02:22:39,510 --> 02:22:42,540
trying to strengthen this whole set up
so he doesn't get knocked unconscious.

2520
02:22:42,570 --> 02:22:45,930
So embarrassing. Why is that
embarrassing? It's fascinating.

2521
02:22:45,990 --> 02:22:48,680
It's fucking embarrassing his man.
Why is it embarrassing? You know?

2522
02:22:48,690 --> 02:22:51,510
That's embarrassing because you never
beat the fuck out of a dude in a cage.

2523
02:22:51,580 --> 02:22:54,820
No, I don't mean no. Look, no.
Look, look, take that shot.

2524
02:22:55,650 --> 02:23:00,300
Come back with a counter drops.
The crowd goes dusk. Hell,

2525
02:23:00,310 --> 02:23:03,880
it's amazing. I think. I
think that's really cool to
watch and I fucking love it,

2526
02:23:03,940 --> 02:23:04,260
right?

2527
02:23:04,260 --> 02:23:09,260
But I just think that when you get into
a situation where you have a bungee cord

2528
02:23:09,371 --> 02:23:13,060
hanging out of your mouth and you're
lifting weights with your jaw,

2529
02:23:13,300 --> 02:23:16,870
it's embarrassing. It's like that moment
in time. If I was doing that, if I'm like,

2530
02:23:16,871 --> 02:23:18,940
gotta get my fucking dry stronger.

2531
02:23:20,030 --> 02:23:22,900
Why don't you fucking
pick up a history book?

2532
02:23:23,080 --> 02:23:26,400
It's time to look at a globe job,

2533
02:23:26,880 --> 02:23:30,180
right? And you're not at the
same time. And here's why.
You're right. You're right.

2534
02:23:30,181 --> 02:23:32,670
Because you see where this is all going.

2535
02:23:32,671 --> 02:23:37,671
You see the falling away of the archaic
models and the ridiculous nature of

2536
02:23:38,491 --> 02:23:41,660
clinging to our monkey genetics.
But we aren't.

2537
02:23:42,070 --> 02:23:46,080
We are trapped in this age and we have
about 80 years to have a good fucking

2538
02:23:46,081 --> 02:23:50,910
time and one of the things that have a
good time, you know you got that right,

2539
02:23:50,911 --> 02:23:53,070
is one of my favorite songs ever.
Leonard Karen Song.

2540
02:23:53,400 --> 02:23:57,660
I like to drink and dance all night.
There's nothing wrong with that.

2541
02:23:57,750 --> 02:24:00,560
It's nothing wrong with liking
a drink and dance all night.

2542
02:24:00,561 --> 02:24:03,810
Now there's nothing wrong with
like glad going to fights.

2543
02:24:03,811 --> 02:24:05,820
These guys agreed to do this.
Let them do it.

2544
02:24:05,850 --> 02:24:08,190
They're going to do what they
want to do it. I used to do it,

2545
02:24:08,191 --> 02:24:11,280
they've got to do it. They're going to do
it. Nothing wrong with that. It's go on.

2546
02:24:11,281 --> 02:24:13,680
Go enjoy it. Yeah. Oh man,

2547
02:24:13,681 --> 02:24:17,070
I feel really bad about porn and
porn exploits women. Well guess what?

2548
02:24:17,160 --> 02:24:19,850
There's 100 million gigabytes it have on.

2549
02:24:20,500 --> 02:24:21,990
Yeah, not me. It's you.

2550
02:24:22,540 --> 02:24:26,140
You're not going to go back in time and
keep those girls from being fingered by

2551
02:24:26,141 --> 02:24:28,540
their uncle. You're not going
to do it. What you know,

2552
02:24:28,541 --> 02:24:32,840
and I've tried and if you can jerk off to
that, you will feel better. No, enjoy it.

2553
02:24:32,890 --> 02:24:33,670
By the way,

2554
02:24:33,670 --> 02:24:37,900
if like you see like if you see a kid
playing with dolls and you go after to the

2555
02:24:37,901 --> 02:24:38,860
kid and you're like,
you know,

2556
02:24:38,861 --> 02:24:41,830
those dogs aren't real and what
you're doing is totally meaningless.

2557
02:24:41,950 --> 02:24:45,520
You're kind of an asshole. You the kids.
Lucky. It's getting to play with dogs.

2558
02:24:45,610 --> 02:24:49,570
The kids fucking lucky that the
kid can get fixated on doors,

2559
02:24:49,640 --> 02:24:52,540
that he can wear a fucking great towel
around his neck and pretend he's a

2560
02:24:52,541 --> 02:24:56,110
superhero and wander around his
backyard with a cardboard sword. Lucky.

2561
02:24:56,111 --> 02:24:58,270
He's lucky. Lucky. But
I, so in the same way,

2562
02:24:58,271 --> 02:25:03,040
when adults are doing the identical thing
and taking on these silly identities

2563
02:25:03,041 --> 02:25:06,790
is drinking their draws and
they're absorbed in their
attention is focused on to

2564
02:25:06,791 --> 02:25:07,930
whatever the fucking thing is,

2565
02:25:07,950 --> 02:25:12,950
whether it's Leonard Skinner drunk at
night of line dancing or somebody punching

2566
02:25:13,151 --> 02:25:16,930
his fist through a fucking wall or
someone climbing a mountain or whatever.

2567
02:25:17,050 --> 02:25:21,280
If that's grabbing your attention,
lucky you, don't stop it,

2568
02:25:21,520 --> 02:25:25,720
go for it. You're being distracted. The
void for a little while, congratulations.

2569
02:25:25,721 --> 02:25:28,600
Fuck you.
But once that shit stops distracting you,

2570
02:25:28,930 --> 02:25:33,930
if you continue on that path and pretend
that it still is like it distracting

2571
02:25:33,941 --> 02:25:36,460
her from the void,
that's like where shit gets weird.

2572
02:25:36,530 --> 02:25:39,500
Maybe maybe you get to a
certain point where you're,

2573
02:25:39,790 --> 02:25:44,480
where you realize what difference does
it make? What difference does it make?

2574
02:25:44,481 --> 02:25:46,880
What my understanding of the situation is,

2575
02:25:46,881 --> 02:25:50,870
what differences that make my acceptance
of the void if I am but a temporary

2576
02:25:50,871 --> 02:25:54,420
creature and should I not
just enjoy this time. Yeah.

2577
02:25:54,430 --> 02:25:59,430
And spread as much positive energy as
possible and contribute my part in a true

2578
02:26:00,111 --> 02:26:04,280
and clear understanding that that I cannot
fix all the things you ever see those

2579
02:26:04,281 --> 02:26:05,810
videos,
but that is my,

2580
02:26:05,980 --> 02:26:10,980
my obligation to enjoy this moment and
to have as much positive feeling as

2581
02:26:12,441 --> 02:26:16,310
possible the most spread as much
positive feeling as possible.

2582
02:26:16,311 --> 02:26:19,130
That is my instinct.
That is my dry.

2583
02:26:19,220 --> 02:26:22,760
When I'm in the isolation tank and
I'm alone and I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm,

2584
02:26:22,761 --> 02:26:25,400
when I'm at my most happiest
when I'm thinking about things.

2585
02:26:25,550 --> 02:26:26,120
You know what I think?

2586
02:26:26,120 --> 02:26:30,200
I think I have a rare opportunity to
spread as much positive energy as possible

2587
02:26:30,290 --> 02:26:35,150
and I think that is what
is most important. That is,
that is my instinctual pull.

2588
02:26:35,270 --> 02:26:38,300
That's what's pulling me. What's pulling
me is I feel like I've got this weird,

2589
02:26:38,301 --> 02:26:41,990
crazy opportunity. We have this
weird, crazy opportunity right now.

2590
02:26:42,050 --> 02:26:45,320
There's at least a half a million people
listening to this and will over the

2591
02:26:45,321 --> 02:26:49,070
course of iTunes and stitcher and
Mario Stream. It's more than that.

2592
02:26:49,071 --> 02:26:49,600
It's going to be easy.

2593
02:26:49,600 --> 02:26:51,740
It's going to be even more than that
over the course of a couple of years

2594
02:26:52,010 --> 02:26:53,930
because this shit is going to
spread and spread and spread.

2595
02:26:54,110 --> 02:26:58,060
And some of these ideas are going to
resonate with people because you are ahead

2596
02:26:58,070 --> 02:27:01,190
of a lot of other people in
this weird game of thinking.

2597
02:27:01,191 --> 02:27:03,890
There's people out there the right now
or listening to this podcast and they are

2598
02:27:03,891 --> 02:27:07,700
19 years old and they've never considered
any of the ideas that Duncan Trussell

2599
02:27:07,701 --> 02:27:08,630
is presenting to them.

2600
02:27:08,810 --> 02:27:12,710
And the idea that you know that that
is human civilization and ideas and all

2601
02:27:12,711 --> 02:27:16,190
these things could be literally alien
lifeforms trying to manifest themselves in

2602
02:27:16,191 --> 02:27:19,460
a conscious way on this plane.
And that's how they interact with people.

2603
02:27:19,560 --> 02:27:21,200
There is a lot of people right now,

2604
02:27:21,201 --> 02:27:24,680
17 1615 sitting with their friends,

2605
02:27:24,800 --> 02:27:27,620
getting their fucking mind blown by you,
dude.

2606
02:27:27,621 --> 02:27:30,410
And you don't think about it
because you're just being a new,

2607
02:27:30,680 --> 02:27:33,200
but that impact is serious and legitimate.

2608
02:27:33,290 --> 02:27:36,800
Yeah, that's a court. And that
impacts, we love it. Well, of course.

2609
02:27:36,801 --> 02:27:38,780
And also why it's fun to,
uh,

2610
02:27:39,170 --> 02:27:44,150
it's what you're saying is
exactly the thing that I'm
obsessed with is, is, uh, is,

2611
02:27:44,240 --> 02:27:46,910
is whatever that is
transmitting like as a,

2612
02:27:46,911 --> 02:27:51,380
anytime you can like help someone
be happier, connect with something.

2613
02:27:51,381 --> 02:27:54,890
It's awesome. Hey, do you think
the Dalai Lama on Twitter's real?

2614
02:27:55,760 --> 02:27:59,500
I don't know if he is.
He's fucking

2615
02:28:02,090 --> 02:28:05,630
positive shit he ever, he writes
positive shit every day. He does.

2616
02:28:05,631 --> 02:28:09,320
He just writes a bunch of fucking
passive isn't it? Is Shit.

2617
02:28:09,350 --> 02:28:13,100
Why is people serve others? Putting
the needs of others above their own.

2618
02:28:13,130 --> 02:28:16,650
The ultimate result would be that
you find more happiness. Hmm.

2619
02:28:16,760 --> 02:28:19,560
He's got sounds like a song written
by a dude who's trying to fuck a girl.

2620
02:28:21,890 --> 02:28:24,710
Amazing.
He's got someone's waiting.

2621
02:28:27,430 --> 02:28:29,800
It's not verified yet.
Of course Twitter doesn't verify anymore.

2622
02:28:29,810 --> 02:28:32,120
I don't know if you guys know
that Twitter style verify.

2623
02:28:32,450 --> 02:28:35,220
Oh well son of a collector,

2624
02:28:35,440 --> 02:28:39,130
father bitches know you have a collector's
edition Twitter that you can sell

2625
02:28:39,150 --> 02:28:42,800
before it to my spacious
cell right now. Yeah, man.

2626
02:28:42,801 --> 02:28:45,020
But to get back to that idea
that we were just talking about.

2627
02:28:45,230 --> 02:28:49,130
When you find yourself successfully
getting fixated on shit,

2628
02:28:49,400 --> 02:28:51,620
like successfully getting into something,

2629
02:28:51,980 --> 02:28:54,350
the last thing you should do is stop it.
It's really up.

2630
02:28:54,440 --> 02:28:58,250
It's kind of sad when you see people who
really enjoy something and out of some

2631
02:28:58,251 --> 02:29:01,880
sense of guilt. They're trying to stop
themselves from doing it, but like,

2632
02:29:02,780 --> 02:29:06,650
like addicts, they keep doing stuff even
though they're clearly aware of that.

2633
02:29:06,651 --> 02:29:10,200
It's not satiating them anymore.
They're just doing out of heavy. Well,

2634
02:29:10,220 --> 02:29:13,250
you've been addicted to things. Fuck
yeah. Yeah. I've been in, I have,

2635
02:29:13,251 --> 02:29:14,390
I have an addictive personality,

2636
02:29:14,391 --> 02:29:19,391
so I know exactly what it's like to
have the focus in my mind sucked away by

2637
02:29:19,941 --> 02:29:23,720
something and for me to consciously think,
I don't want to do this anyway.

2638
02:29:23,960 --> 02:29:27,500
This is a direct, this,
this, this conversation.

2639
02:29:27,540 --> 02:29:31,220
This idea is directly connected to what
we were talking about earlier about

2640
02:29:31,221 --> 02:29:36,221
hijacking the reward system
about something that is
artificial and artificial in

2641
02:29:37,041 --> 02:29:38,450
its power and its potency.

2642
02:29:38,451 --> 02:29:41,900
The idea of what can fucking fucking the
Oxycontin pill, that shit is artificial.

2643
02:29:41,901 --> 02:29:44,570
This is not, suppose somebody,
something's not supposed to impact you.

2644
02:29:44,571 --> 02:29:49,250
That strong a fucking Avatar Avatar in
three d if you were a caveman, your,

2645
02:29:49,251 --> 02:29:53,930
your GNA is basically the same DNA as
people that live 10,000 years ago drawing

2646
02:29:53,931 --> 02:29:57,350
fucking stupid buffaloes and
the caves. Well, you know,

2647
02:29:57,351 --> 02:30:00,080
on the cave walls while we're
living by the light of a fire,

2648
02:30:00,230 --> 02:30:02,380
I mean w w th th th th it's,

2649
02:30:02,400 --> 02:30:05,450
it's impossible to wrap your fucking
head around the kind of impact that's

2650
02:30:05,451 --> 02:30:07,100
having on the organism.

2651
02:30:07,180 --> 02:30:08,170
Yeah, well that, that,

2652
02:30:08,171 --> 02:30:12,700
that it's all a magnification
of the four basic drives,

2653
02:30:13,060 --> 02:30:15,790
eating, sleeping, mating and defending.

2654
02:30:15,791 --> 02:30:19,900
Those are the things that drive all ma
or of a prime most organic forms of life.

2655
02:30:19,901 --> 02:30:21,150
I don't know about Amoebas and shit,

2656
02:30:21,780 --> 02:30:26,160
but, and love and law and look, look,
you know, it sounds gay as fuck,

2657
02:30:26,161 --> 02:30:29,670
but we could say it because we're drunk.
The reason why this podcast works,

2658
02:30:29,671 --> 02:30:31,020
the reason why,
you know,

2659
02:30:31,050 --> 02:30:33,750
we all can do this over and over and
over again is because we love each other.

2660
02:30:33,810 --> 02:30:36,470
We're all passing notes underneath the
table to each other. We're playing footsie

2661
02:30:39,390 --> 02:30:43,580
about data.
Everyone would be if we all are even,

2662
02:30:43,610 --> 02:30:48,290
how about if we only did this podcast
holding hands and with our sweaty feet

2663
02:30:48,291 --> 02:30:52,610
touching each other [inaudible]
with each other afterwards.

2664
02:30:52,611 --> 02:30:53,444
Like we all like that.

2665
02:30:56,560 --> 02:31:00,520
But you know the reason why we can have
this conversation and be so fucking

2666
02:31:00,521 --> 02:31:03,070
crazy with our ideas that is, you
know, I'm not going to judge you.

2667
02:31:03,110 --> 02:31:06,670
You know the judgment between you
and me is already done. It's over.

2668
02:31:06,671 --> 02:31:09,370
We met each other, we know each
other literally inside and out.

2669
02:31:09,371 --> 02:31:12,760
I know that your weirdest fucking thing.
You lived with me. We lived together.

2670
02:31:12,780 --> 02:31:13,613
Yeah.
You know,

2671
02:31:13,620 --> 02:31:16,330
you know and Brian and I have known each
other for almost a decade. What are,

2672
02:31:16,360 --> 02:31:18,340
we've known each,
we know each other inside and out.

2673
02:31:18,530 --> 02:31:20,280
Brian and I have cried together.
Its gaze

2674
02:31:20,280 --> 02:31:23,280
that sounds, yeah, we, we've cried
together. You know, he's, he's my friend.

2675
02:31:23,281 --> 02:31:25,680
We've known each other forever.
So because that,

2676
02:31:25,681 --> 02:31:28,560
because we know each other so well
and we know we're both looking out.

2677
02:31:28,590 --> 02:31:30,450
We're all three looking
out for each other.

2678
02:31:30,451 --> 02:31:33,480
Rather we can say anything
and then we can say anything.

2679
02:31:33,600 --> 02:31:37,470
But what we're doing is we're saying
anything and somehow or another way more

2680
02:31:37,471 --> 02:31:41,040
people than we're ever going to meet ever
in our fucking life are listening all

2681
02:31:41,041 --> 02:31:42,210
at once. Yeah, it's crazy.

2682
02:31:42,211 --> 02:31:44,550
That's where things get squirrely
and that's where things get,

2683
02:31:44,551 --> 02:31:48,210
you know when we sit and be calm to play,
like you know, what is consciousness?

2684
02:31:48,211 --> 02:31:51,270
What is reality? What are ideas? What
does imagination, where does it go?

2685
02:31:51,271 --> 02:31:54,210
Why is it going? Why is it going
through you? Why is it going through me?

2686
02:31:54,360 --> 02:31:55,140
Why do you,

2687
02:31:55,140 --> 02:32:00,140
why are we so looking forward to going
to New Orleans where this weekend you and

2688
02:32:00,361 --> 02:32:01,580
I are going to go to the house of Blues,

2689
02:32:01,600 --> 02:32:04,830
a sold out show and we're going to perform
for that. We don't know those people.

2690
02:32:05,080 --> 02:32:07,530
I'll probably know 10 people
in the audience will be a
bunch of people from the

2691
02:32:07,531 --> 02:32:10,840
UFC that we'll ask for tickets,
I'll hook them up, you know,

2692
02:32:10,860 --> 02:32:14,130
they'd be 2030 people and it's you and
me and we can have the greatest fucking

2693
02:32:14,131 --> 02:32:16,290
time and right. It's going
to be incredible big. Why?

2694
02:32:16,291 --> 02:32:18,540
Because you've been putting
that thing out your whole life.

2695
02:32:18,780 --> 02:32:20,340
And I've been putting that
thing out of my whole life.

2696
02:32:20,410 --> 02:32:24,540
You would cry if you, if he found
out it was a guy also, what guy? The,

2697
02:32:24,610 --> 02:32:25,443
when we create it again,

2698
02:32:29,180 --> 02:32:33,150
fucking podcasts over Brian.
Brian gets the line of the night.

2699
02:32:34,270 --> 02:32:37,300
If you want to get in touch with Dunkin
and you can follow him on Twitter and

2700
02:32:37,301 --> 02:32:41,410
now he's obligated to respond to all of
your messages because he told you that

2701
02:32:41,411 --> 02:32:43,430
all you had to do was
call him about the flux.

2702
02:32:43,610 --> 02:32:45,330
I didn't say podcasts,

2703
02:32:45,390 --> 02:32:46,980
searches video with Tim and Eric.

2704
02:32:46,981 --> 02:32:49,710
I don't think we've ever talked about it
on this podcast that we talked about it

2705
02:32:49,711 --> 02:32:54,690
and he has the surfing video,
the body surf, Adi Boys,
legend, Legend or the pipe.

2706
02:32:54,850 --> 02:32:58,730
One of the best videos. I laughed
my ass off. Yeah, it's pretty great.

2707
02:32:58,740 --> 02:33:03,720
So it's something I did with Tim
and Eric for a HBO is funny or die.

2708
02:33:05,550 --> 02:33:09,610
Is that it? It's, you know, it's
something I did for Tim and Eric for Hbs,

2709
02:33:09,630 --> 02:33:10,800
funny or die and it's like,

2710
02:33:11,070 --> 02:33:15,990
basically I take off on the
skateboarding videos, but it's about,

2711
02:33:16,080 --> 02:33:19,980
we play these 80,
it's like idiots who learned to body surf.

2712
02:33:19,981 --> 02:33:24,690
But mainly it's just about us all. Fucking
this one dude on the team. It's really,

2713
02:33:24,720 --> 02:33:29,110
it's one of the best things. You
fucked a dude on a beach. Each horse,

2714
02:33:29,500 --> 02:33:31,590
each horse thought of it.
You kissed another guy.

2715
02:33:31,591 --> 02:33:34,560
What was it like to kiss another guy?
It was amazing.

2716
02:33:37,630 --> 02:33:38,360
You kissed.

2717
02:33:38,360 --> 02:33:41,830
You guys are real. Well, I mean, I,
I believe it was on the cheek. No,

2718
02:33:42,470 --> 02:33:44,900
I don't remember it though. It was on
the Dick. You know. I love you bro.

2719
02:33:44,930 --> 02:33:47,120
I'm just kidding. All right.
It's a very funny video.

2720
02:33:48,290 --> 02:33:50,420
What are the dates, man? Uh,

2721
02:33:50,660 --> 02:33:54,170
what's still available this weekend is
totally sold out tomorrow, by the way.

2722
02:33:54,650 --> 02:33:58,220
Nowhere out of nowhere show we're
doing it. The Ice House. Oh, here's,

2723
02:33:58,221 --> 02:34:01,570
here's what you should talk about
this real quick. We are all of us. Uh,

2724
02:34:01,670 --> 02:34:04,460
last weekend we did the
comedy. Um, there's,

2725
02:34:04,461 --> 02:34:06,620
there's two rooms at the
Ice House in Pasadena,

2726
02:34:06,621 --> 02:34:08,120
which is one of my favorite
clubs in the country.

2727
02:34:08,121 --> 02:34:11,480
It's been around for about 30
plus years, I think. 35 years.

2728
02:34:11,481 --> 02:34:14,200
It's not just a comedy club,
it's Goddamn museum you bought.

2729
02:34:14,210 --> 02:34:16,820
It's like the comedy and Magic Club
and her Masa. It's one of those clubs.

2730
02:34:16,821 --> 02:34:18,040
It's been forever and

2731
02:34:18,040 --> 02:34:22,900
it's got all this like a really amazing
history and the walls and it's a really

2732
02:34:22,901 --> 02:34:26,650
cool fucking club. And there's a, there's
two rooms. There's the big showroom.

2733
02:34:26,860 --> 02:34:30,580
I say big, you know, in quotes,
it's 185 seats. It's very
small. It's very intimate.

2734
02:34:30,760 --> 02:34:34,660
But then this other room it's
like 85 seats. And uh, you know,

2735
02:34:34,661 --> 02:34:37,540
Brian and I w you know, an all company.
You've, uh, you've talked about it,

2736
02:34:37,541 --> 02:34:38,830
we've talked about it before about like,

2737
02:34:38,831 --> 02:34:42,370
what's the perfect size of the comedy
club? I don't know. I mean, we're,

2738
02:34:42,371 --> 02:34:45,970
this weekend we're going to do somewhere
around 700 people at the House of Blues,

2739
02:34:45,971 --> 02:34:47,380
which is, you know, like a medium.

2740
02:34:47,650 --> 02:34:50,740
And then there's like the really small
places where it's like the ice house,

2741
02:34:50,800 --> 02:34:53,020
which is like 85 people.

2742
02:34:53,021 --> 02:34:57,620
And then this October 7th
at in Houston with uh, uh,

2743
02:34:57,700 --> 02:34:59,770
Brendan Walsh and me and Joey Diaz,

2744
02:34:59,860 --> 02:35:02,380
we're going to do that
horizon wireless theater,

2745
02:35:02,381 --> 02:35:06,550
just like thousands of fucking people.
So it's all different sizes,

2746
02:35:06,551 --> 02:35:10,930
but there's something magical about
those little fucking rooms, man.

2747
02:35:11,170 --> 02:35:15,600
And we did that little, we did that
little 85 seat room at the ice house this,

2748
02:35:15,640 --> 02:35:18,750
this past weekend.
And Brian and I and,

2749
02:35:18,751 --> 02:35:23,260
and Ari and manager Madrigal
and Brendan Walsh, all of us,

2750
02:35:23,261 --> 02:35:25,930
we got together and we talked about, I
was like, this place is fucking great.

2751
02:35:26,170 --> 02:35:27,970
And then someone came up the idea,
I don't know,

2752
02:35:28,160 --> 02:35:29,200
it was,
I was like,

2753
02:35:29,330 --> 02:35:32,790
imagine just renting out that room right
there and doing a podcast. And I showed,

2754
02:35:32,900 --> 02:35:33,850
okay, that's fine. Yeah.

2755
02:35:33,960 --> 02:35:37,050
Well it also, Brendan said, I
know it was Brendan Walsh said,

2756
02:35:37,051 --> 02:35:38,910
why don't I just do it right here,
right in front of the door,

2757
02:35:39,150 --> 02:35:39,970
which I don't know if that

2758
02:35:39,970 --> 02:35:44,680
word, but it might work sometimes. Can
you imagine fans trying to do a podcast?

2759
02:35:46,180 --> 02:35:47,410
Well,
this is what I was thinking.

2760
02:35:47,411 --> 02:35:51,550
If we hired some Tait Fletcher looking
dudes to fucking keep people away from

2761
02:35:51,551 --> 02:35:56,551
you and fucking keep the peace and then
just the energy of all those people.

2762
02:35:57,011 --> 02:35:59,780
As long as they didn't
interfere the energy of all
those people hanging out sec.

2763
02:35:59,800 --> 02:36:01,180
When we did the live show with Jim Norton,

2764
02:36:01,181 --> 02:36:02,980
there was definitely a different feeling.

2765
02:36:02,981 --> 02:36:06,700
When you are trying to feel like you're
entertaining people watching you,

2766
02:36:06,910 --> 02:36:10,120
it's cool to hear. We're
hanging out. Podcast has great.

2767
02:36:10,121 --> 02:36:13,150
I did a live podcast at the laughing
skull on stage. It was fucking awesome.

2768
02:36:13,190 --> 02:36:14,170
That's a small club.

2769
02:36:15,130 --> 02:36:16,000
Norton is small too.

2770
02:36:16,001 --> 02:36:18,880
We did it at Kevin Smith's placement
only like 60 people I think,

2771
02:36:19,240 --> 02:36:22,180
but my point is that you can,
you can.

2772
02:36:22,210 --> 02:36:24,970
We're going to do our
idea for a podcast with,

2773
02:36:24,971 --> 02:36:28,900
we kind of assimilate it all our ideas
together and the best idea seems to be

2774
02:36:29,170 --> 02:36:30,250
wherever we put it,

2775
02:36:30,430 --> 02:36:34,750
it's the comics that are right about to
go on stage or just got off stage and

2776
02:36:34,751 --> 02:36:37,600
we're fucking smoking when we're
talking shit. Just like this,

2777
02:36:37,601 --> 02:36:42,590
just like the show and we do it. You Know
Brendan Walsh, Jon Heffron, John Reese,

2778
02:36:42,610 --> 02:36:45,490
who the fuck? Who the fuck is
in town? You know anybody who,

2779
02:36:45,630 --> 02:36:48,700
Joe Judah Friedlander texted me and
said he wants to come on the show.

2780
02:36:48,880 --> 02:36:51,130
How would you to frailer
Freelander you know,

2781
02:36:51,490 --> 02:36:53,170
calls us on a Wednesday night and says,
Hey,

2782
02:36:53,171 --> 02:36:56,610
I want to come to your fucking crazy
podcast thing at the ice house. Boom.

2783
02:36:56,620 --> 02:37:00,910
It comes down to the ice house and we
have this wild ass show with 85 people in

2784
02:37:00,911 --> 02:37:02,150
that little room.
We do a free

2785
02:37:02,240 --> 02:37:07,140
podcasts. We all have a good time. The
idea with Hollywood bullshit. Exactly.

2786
02:37:07,141 --> 02:37:09,710
Not deal with traffic and black wizards,

2787
02:37:09,750 --> 02:37:13,590
black wizards and parking and nonsense.
Listen,

2788
02:37:13,591 --> 02:37:16,250
you fucking Goddamn fucking

2789
02:37:16,250 --> 02:37:18,910
show is over. Wait, can I tell
people this show I'm doing

2790
02:37:26,010 --> 02:37:26,843
testing

2791
02:37:30,910 --> 02:37:34,570
September 23rd uh, Joe Diaz
Brennan. Oh No. Joe Diaz,

2792

Ari Shaffir and I are at the
paramount theater in Denver.

2793
02:37:39,341 --> 02:37:43,150

available. They're going
quick. There's not much left.

2794
02:37:43,570 --> 02:37:45,250

or the 30th and the 1st of October.

2805
02:38:22,810 --> 02:38:26,200

Approximately who loves
Ya. Next week we will, uh,

2817
02:39:05,410 --> 02:39:06,790
we were going to get as
many people as you want.

2818
02:39:06,791 --> 02:39:09,430
I know that a Jim Norton is in town.
Jim contacted me.

2819
02:39:09,431 --> 02:39:11,900
We're going to try to get Jim
in here and uh, we're going to,

2820
02:39:11,930 --> 02:39:14,110
when I would try to do Judah
Freelander like I said,

2821
02:39:14,320 --> 02:39:18,130
we're going to do max cries and you're
to Eliza slash for sure she has a new

2822
02:39:18,131 --> 02:39:20,130
show and um,
uh,

2823
02:39:20,890 --> 02:39:24,370
for sure Graham Hancock and that
will most likely be the 23rd.

2824
02:39:24,520 --> 02:39:27,790
Not sure if we're going to do a Ustream
with that because it all depends on how

2825
02:39:27,791 --> 02:39:31,030
good the a wireless system is in
the hotel. We go to in Irvine,

2826
02:39:31,031 --> 02:39:34,090
they usually suck ass. It does. It
sucks ass. They suck hard. Yeah.

2827
02:39:34,230 --> 02:39:37,620
Maybe we can record. Oh, did you use
during lets me record to the computer.

2828
02:39:37,621 --> 02:39:39,780
So we're good. We just have
to, I can't do it live.

2829
02:39:39,781 --> 02:39:43,050
Maybe so we can upload the video
on Vimeo. We can't do it. What's,

2830
02:39:43,051 --> 02:39:44,340
what do you mean we can't do it live?
But no,

2831
02:39:44,370 --> 02:39:46,440
I mean like if we're at a
hotel that the internet sucks.

2832
02:39:46,470 --> 02:39:51,060
The new Ustream lets you record to your
computer and then go back and upload it

2833
02:39:51,061 --> 02:39:54,300
later. What's, yeah. For
Real. Yeah. For Real.

2834
02:39:54,420 --> 02:39:58,050
So we can do private shows whenever we
went to, you know, is this some new shit?

2835
02:39:58,080 --> 02:40:01,950
Yeah. And you should, when did
this happen? Uh, about a month ago.

2836
02:40:02,220 --> 02:40:04,450
And what does this Vimeo thing,
you've got some shit up on vein.

2837
02:40:04,451 --> 02:40:05,284
It's like youtube.

2838
02:40:05,820 --> 02:40:09,450
Yeah. Son. Brad hunts the bowl.
Nice a lot buddy. He's the,

2839
02:40:09,451 --> 02:40:13,120
I'm the fucking big Maha over at, um, uh,

2840
02:40:13,140 --> 02:40:17,170
the president and founder of Ustream
and he puts our shit online and uh,

2841
02:40:17,250 --> 02:40:19,950
he and I haven't been going through, he's
very good guy. He was like your podcast.

2842
02:40:20,160 --> 02:40:24,820
Yeah. Good people use streaming. I like
stitcher. Oh, I'm going to go on, um, the,

2843
02:40:24,830 --> 02:40:28,010
the Nerdist podcast too, for sure.
I'm going to do that as well. Uh,

2844
02:40:28,080 --> 02:40:31,440
Chris Hardwick's a buddy and I ran into
him at the airport recently and people

2845
02:40:31,480 --> 02:40:31,731
say like,

2846
02:40:31,731 --> 02:40:35,040
you guys got in the best Twitter argument
ever because you like solved it like

2847
02:40:35,041 --> 02:40:38,460
so like civil lead. Everybody was so cool.
It wasn't really an argument, you know?

2848
02:40:38,461 --> 02:40:43,200
I mean he doesn't like the stitcher thing
and I understand his point and I like

2849
02:40:43,201 --> 02:40:46,200
it and he
whatever.

2850
02:40:47,460 --> 02:40:50,680
And anything else? Anything
else? We all look, oh, I'm sorry.

2851
02:40:50,890 --> 02:40:52,810
