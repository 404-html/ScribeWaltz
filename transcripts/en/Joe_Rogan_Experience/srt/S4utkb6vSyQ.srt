1
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:04,290
Three,
two,

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:05,190
one,

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:07,590
and we're live.
What's up?

4
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:08,570
Right.
Hey Man,

5
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:09,270
let's go on.
Great.

6
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,480
Sam Harris,
ladies and gentlemen at Harris and 

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:14,480
Harris.
Dan and Sam.

8
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,391
No relation,
obviously no relation and brother from 

9
00:00:17,391 --> 00:00:17,391
another mother kind of thing.
Aw,

10
00:00:17,391 --> 00:00:18,960
sweet.
Actually know how we work this out.

11
00:00:18,961 --> 00:00:23,961
We are deeply unrelated because you're 
your Harris is the Jewish side of your 

12
00:00:24,181 --> 00:00:24,740
family,
right?

13
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:25,120
No,
no,

14
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:25,360
no,
no.

15
00:00:25,361 --> 00:00:27,720
To my Harris is the Yes to actually,
no,

16
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:32,730
you're right.
My Harris is the Jewish side of the 

17
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:34,531
family.
It was changed at Ellis Island from 

18
00:00:34,531 --> 00:00:34,930
allegedly from Adis,
which doesn't sound Jewish either,

19
00:00:34,931 --> 00:00:36,760
but uh,
yes,

20
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
right.
Your heart is the Glam side of the 

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,421
family.
Funny how many people's names were 

22
00:00:45,421 --> 00:00:45,421
changed at Ellis Island?
Yeah,

23
00:00:45,421 --> 00:00:45,780
like what are they like?
Nah,

24
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,550
not American enough.
Meanwhile,

25
00:00:48,551 --> 00:00:51,820
snorts egg made it proudly.
Yeah.

26
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:53,320
Odd.
So,

27
00:00:53,321 --> 00:00:54,490
uh,
anyway,

28
00:00:54,491 --> 00:00:57,430
thanks for coming you guys.
Thanks for having some weird time.

29
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,760
You know,
I've been extra weirded out over the 

30
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:02,760
last couple months and I just got back 
from Mexico,

31
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,720
was on vacation.
I didn't do shit for a week and in not 

32
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,751
doing anything for a week,
I really got a chance to sit down and 

33
00:01:09,751 --> 00:01:13,350
think about stuff and I'm more weirded 
out by life today than I think I ever 

34
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:17,491
have been before.
So I'm excited to have you on because I 

35
00:01:17,491 --> 00:01:20,641
want to hear your story because Sam has 
been telling me about it and I looked 

36
00:01:20,641 --> 00:01:24,520
into it and please explain like what 
happened to you,

37
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,040
like where you were and what happened to
you.

38
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:28,490
Okay.
So it was a,

39
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:29,740
you're,
you're talking about the panic attack.

40
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:35,140
It was 2004.
I was on a little show that we do at ABC

41
00:01:35,441 --> 00:01:37,810
news called Good Morning America.
Big shots,

42
00:01:37,811 --> 00:01:39,940
a big show show.
It's not a little show.

43
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:46,110
And I was,
I was doing the job that I was filling 

44
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:49,021
in as the news reader.
That's the person who comes on at the 

45
00:01:49,021 --> 00:01:49,021
top of each hour and reason the 
headlines.

46
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:53,620
And I just freaked out.
I just lost it.

47
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:59,930
So as a couple seconds into it and I,
I started to get really scared and it 

48
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:00,840
just,
uh,

49
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:02,430
if you've ever had a pet,
have you ever had a panic?

50
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,590
No.
So it's like anxiety on steroids,

51
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,680
so you start to worry,
but then your fight or flight instincts 

52
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:10,680
kick in.
So,

53
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,640
um,
your lungs seize up,

54
00:02:12,641 --> 00:02:15,580
your palms start sweating,
your mouth dries up,

55
00:02:15,581 --> 00:02:17,620
your heart is racing,
your mind is racing.

56
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:23,070
You just,
I couldn't breathe and therefore 

57
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,430
couldn't speak.
So a couple of seconds into reading what

58
00:02:24,431 --> 00:02:26,950
was supposed to be six stories right off
of the teleprompter.

59
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:32,310
I just,
I lost the capacity to speak and I had 

60
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,370
to kind of squeak out a,
something about,

61
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,270
you know,
back to you,

62
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,340
to the main anchors.
Wow.

63
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:38,010
That sucked.
Uncontrollable.

64
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:38,760
No.
What,

65
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:39,640
what caused it?

66
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,410
I do,
yeah,

67
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:47,700
definitely know I'm some dumb behavior 
in my personal life is what caused it.

68
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:52,750
I had spent a lot of time as a war 
reporter at ABC News.

69
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,350
I was in Afghanistan and Pakistan,
Israel,

70
00:02:56,351 --> 00:02:58,280
the West Bank,
Gaza six,

71
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:03,320
six trips to and uh,
I had come home from a long run and I 

72
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:07,640
covered a kind of pre-invasion invasion 
and then a insurgency in one's kind of 

73
00:03:09,371 --> 00:03:14,371
six month run and I came home after that
and I got depressed and I didn't 

74
00:03:14,371 --> 00:03:19,051
actually know I was depressed,
but I was having some obvious symptoms 

75
00:03:19,051 --> 00:03:19,051
in hindsight.
Uh,

76
00:03:19,051 --> 00:03:21,240
I was having trouble getting out of bed,
felt like that,

77
00:03:21,241 --> 00:03:25,600
had a low grade fever all the time.
And then I did something really smart,

78
00:03:25,601 --> 00:03:28,870
which is I started to self medicate with
cocaine and ecstasy.

79
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:34,500
Uh,
and even though I wasn't doing it all 

80
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:34,500
the time,
I like to say it wasn't like that,

81
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:39,130
you know,
you ever see the wolf of Wall Street 

82
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:39,130
where they're popping ludes that that 
wasn't me.

83
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:43,700
I was,
and I wasn't getting high on the air or 

84
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:43,700
anything like that,
but,

85
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:43,700
you know,
I was getting,

86
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,850
I was partying in my spare time because 
it made me feel better.

87
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:51,550
Uh,
so after I had the panic attack I went 

88
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,581
to a doctor who's an expert in panic and
he started asking me a bunch of 

89
00:03:53,581 --> 00:03:53,581
questions,
try to figure out what,

90
00:03:53,581 --> 00:03:54,460
what,
what had caused the panic attack and one

91
00:03:54,461 --> 00:03:56,950
of the questions was do,
do drugs,

92
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:58,600
and I was like,
yeah,

93
00:03:58,601 --> 00:04:02,140
I do drugs.
And he leaned back in his chair and gave

94
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:04,150
me a look.
That's communicated,

95
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,650
uh,
the following sentiment.

96
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:08,200
Um,
okay asshole mystery solved.

97
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,150
And he just pointed out that,
you know,

98
00:04:10,151 --> 00:04:13,120
you raised the level of adrenaline in 
your brain artificially,

99
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:14,620
uh,
you,

100
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,690
you make it much more likely to have a 
panic attack.

101
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:19,510
And I at at,
at baseline,

102
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,090
I'm a jittery little dudes so it 
doesn't,

103
00:04:22,091 --> 00:04:24,070
doesn't take much to put me in that 
zone.

104
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:29,690
We can just offer me coffee.
And I said no because that even that 

105
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:29,690
will freak me out.

106
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:33,750
Well,
it's weird that ecstasy and cocaine was 

107
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,271
the combination because ecstasy is 
something that they actually give to a 

108
00:04:36,271 --> 00:04:39,361
lot of soldiers that have ptsd.
And there's been quite a few tests on 

109
00:04:39,361 --> 00:04:39,361
that.
Yeah,

110
00:04:39,361 --> 00:04:43,240
I don't,
I don't actually think ecstasy was the 

111
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:43,240
problem.
The coke,

112
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:43,240
I think it was a coke.
Yeah,

113
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:43,460
that makes sense.
Yeah.

114
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,240
So those are the two drugs I was mostly 
doing.

115
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,230
How often were you doing it?

116
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,110
I would say,
you know,

117
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,660
there would be months where I wasn't 
doing it at all because I would,

118
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:55,190
I was off.
I covered the 2004 presidential campaign

119
00:04:55,191 --> 00:04:57,850
that I didn't have a lot of time to be 
snorting coke.

120
00:04:57,851 --> 00:04:58,980
So,
um,

121
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:01,570
but when I was home and around my 
friends,

122
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,250
you know,
on a good,

123
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,960
on a busy week,
you know,

124
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,010
two,
three times a week.

125
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:07,740
Wow.
That's a lot.

126
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:10,860
Yeah,
that'll do you [inaudible] there's a,

127
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:16,160
there's a comeback right now that 
cocaine is experiencing really ever go 

128
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,090
away.
I don't know,

129
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,440
I've never done it.
Was there some sort of cocaine recession

130
00:05:19,441 --> 00:05:21,420
that had to bounce back from?
I believe there was really.

131
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:26,470
No,
this is what I'm talking totally 

132
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:28,341
ignorant.
I've been out of the game for a long 

133
00:05:28,341 --> 00:05:28,341
time,
so yeah.

134
00:05:28,341 --> 00:05:28,341
Yeah.
I'm,

135
00:05:28,341 --> 00:05:31,110
I'm kind of boring now.
I'm a,

136
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:34,080
but it feels to me like it's kind of a 
perennial favorite.

137
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,550
Yeah.
I don't know.

138
00:05:35,551 --> 00:05:37,260
I mean,
I feel like it went through a recession,

139
00:05:37,261 --> 00:05:40,870
maybe it's just my perception.
I had a buddy of mine when I was in high

140
00:05:40,871 --> 00:05:45,871
school and his cousin was hooked on coke
and I watched while we're in high 

141
00:05:45,871 --> 00:05:50,391
school,
we start selling it and he withered 

142
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:51,921
away,
lost like 30 pounds or something like 

143
00:05:51,921 --> 00:05:51,921
that and just him and his girlfriend 
just hide out in the attic.

144
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,550
They lived,
they had an attic apartment.

145
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,100
They would just hide out there and watch
TV and do coconut oil,

146
00:05:56,101 --> 00:05:58,160
coke to people and I was like,
well

147
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,770
fuck that drug,
whatever that drug's doing.

148
00:06:00,771 --> 00:06:05,771
Like these people.
It was almost like knowing someone who 

149
00:06:05,771 --> 00:06:06,740
had gotten bitten by a vampire become 
something different.

150
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:12,040
It was very strange.
So my experience is seeing people do 

151
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,890
that led me to never do it.
Yeah,

152
00:06:12,891 --> 00:06:14,840
I mean it certainly was not like that 
for me,

153
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:15,920
but you know,
I,

154
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,350
I could see it over the horizon.
You can.

155
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:22,400
It's an incredibly addictive drug.
So I think you've made the right call.

156
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,320
Yeah,
it seems a little.

157
00:06:24,321 --> 00:06:26,150
It's got a little too much gravity 
attached to it.

158
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,530
Yeah,
I mean,

159
00:06:27,531 --> 00:06:28,350
you,
you,

160
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,980
you can get hooked and it will bring you
down.

161
00:06:30,981 --> 00:06:33,650
There are other drugs you can do.
I'm not recommending drugs,

162
00:06:33,651 --> 00:06:34,130
but,
uh,

163
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,660
the way of my friend Sam,
my,

164
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:37,370
my half brother,
Sam over there.

165
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:38,260
Let me get to it.

166
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,710
Uh,
there are other drugs,

167
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:46,190
drugs you can do that have vastly lower 
addictive,

168
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:48,590
uh,
a character,

169
00:06:48,591 --> 00:06:50,630
a character.
What's the word I'm looking for here?

170
00:06:50,631 --> 00:06:51,410
So,
characteristics.

171
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,070
Yes.
Thank you.

172
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,950
Um,
so how did you recover?

173
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,490
I,
so I wasn't actually doing it that long.

174
00:06:58,491 --> 00:07:02,600
I actually never done hard drugs into my
early thirties and when I came home from

175
00:07:02,601 --> 00:07:05,540
the war zones and,
and that's what started it.

176
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:08,090
Yeah.
Were freaked out by seeing too much.

177
00:07:08,091 --> 00:07:08,590
No,
you know,

178
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:11,760
it's actually wasn't ptsd.
Uh,

179
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:16,780
it was,
I was addicted to the adrenaline I was 

180
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:19,481
having was not that I was traumatized.
It was that I was enjoying it too much 

181
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:21,230
and I would come home and the world 
would seem gray and boring.

182
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,630
Uh,
yes.

183
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,950
That was,
that was the problem.

184
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:26,890
Did you watch her locker?
I'm sure you did it,

185
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:29,000
yeah.
Did that resonate with you?

186
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,820
It's been a while since I watched it,
but apps,

187
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,540
absolutely.

188
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:37,540
I want to just be clear that the 
experience of a journalist is so 

189
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:41,060
different from the experience,
so much more mild than the experience of

190
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:43,610
a,
an enlisted man or a woman.

191
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,450
So I don't want to compare my experience
to,

192
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:50,000
to the hurt locker.
I'm a observer on the side and I,

193
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:55,060
and,
and I don't even want to compare my 

194
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:55,220
experience to more experienced work 
correspondence out there.

195
00:07:55,221 --> 00:08:00,221
I'm thinking of like guys like Richard 
Angle and I'm absolutely just actually 

196
00:08:00,221 --> 00:08:02,090
sat down with him the other day for he's
got to do documentary coming out.

197
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:07,150
Um,
my experiences are much more mild than 

198
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:11,501
that,
but certainly enough to really get a 

199
00:08:11,501 --> 00:08:11,501
sense of how thrilling it is.
There's an expression,

200
00:08:11,501 --> 00:08:13,310
there's nothing more thrilling than the 
bullet that misses you.

201
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,920
And in my case,
luckily they all missed.

202
00:08:15,921 --> 00:08:18,740
That was not true for some of my 
friends.

203
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:19,970
Um,
but you.

204
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,770
So I,
I had a real sense of the stakes,

205
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:26,330
but 80 is exciting.
It's also thrilling on a,

206
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,610
um,
on a idealistic level.

207
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:33,640
I mean,
I believe in the importance of bearing 

208
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:33,800
witness to the what,
to the tip of the spirit,

209
00:08:33,801 --> 00:08:38,801
to what we're doing,
to what our military is doing in our 

210
00:08:38,801 --> 00:08:39,290
name.
So all of that is a heady mix.

211
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,640
So you knew people over there,
a journalist that got killed?

212
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:44,120
Oh yeah,
absolutely.

213
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:49,630
A very good friend of mine,
the guy who actually ultimately set me 

214
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:49,880
up with my wife.
It was a guy named Bob Woodruff,

215
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:53,870
who was the anchor of world news tonight
on ABC News.

216
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:59,140
He had only been in the chair for about 
a month when he was on a trip to Iraq 

217
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:02,870
and he got hit,
literally got his head nearly blown off 

218
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,320
when he was in the back when he was in 
the top of an Iraqi tank.

219
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,140
Uh,
almost died.

220
00:09:06,141 --> 00:09:11,141
He was an absolute miracle is alive.
There are pictures of him on the 

221
00:09:11,141 --> 00:09:11,730
Internet with basically half ahead.
Um,

222
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:17,570
traumatic brain injury was brought back 
to life is to this day walking miracle 

223
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,030
that he's alive.
Uh,

224
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,120
and,
and after he recovered,

225
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:24,030
he then introduced me to the woman I 
married.

226
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,890
So he's a close friend and I,
uh,

227
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:29,820
I saw cases like that,
lost friends,

228
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:33,180
both Iraqi friends and journalist 
friends.

229
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,680
Um,
my,

230
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:37,110
the woman I was dating at the time when 
I,

231
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,550
when I was spending a lot of time in 
Iraq,

232
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,200
she got hit by a tank show.
Um,

233
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:46,910
she was in,
in the hotel Palestine where all the 

234
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:50,811
journalists were staying.
She was on a balcony in or one of her 

235
00:09:50,811 --> 00:09:53,430
colleagues in the balcony below or he 
got a direct hit and died.

236
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:54,220
Uh,
he,

237
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:59,270
she carried him to the hospital and she 
basically got the reverberations and 

238
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:00,000
couldn't hear.
Still can't hear as far as I know.

239
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:07,740
When you're a journalist and you're over
in Iraq or in Afghanistan,

240
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:12,741
you're in war and what you're 
experiencing is so far removed from the 

241
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,200
day to day life that most people 
experience.

242
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:21,650
What,
what is it like trying to relay that to 

243
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:21,650
people?
How difficult is it trying to.

244
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:26,540
Because I think so many people have this
almost a dramatic television movie slash

245
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,930
view of,
of war where they don't,

246
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:34,800
they don't ever experience it.
Like I would imagine probably 99 percent

247
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:39,000
of the people that are in this country 
will never experience.

248
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,020
No.
And that's good.

249
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:41,610
You know,
it's,

250
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,930
it's,
I don't know that you can describe it,

251
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:51,920
uh,
in a way that will really give the full 

252
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,280
picture of,
it's a absurdities and,

253
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:58,340
and horrors and long stretches of 
boredom punctuated by terror.

254
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,230
Um,

255
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,960
and also this other piece which is taboo
to talk about,

256
00:11:02,961 --> 00:11:06,980
which is the pleasure and excitement.
Then people get fighting wars.

257
00:11:06,981 --> 00:11:07,260
I mean,
go.

258
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,860
This is Sebastian younger's thesis as 
well.

259
00:11:09,861 --> 00:11:14,861
I mean they just,
the comradery is the most intense 

260
00:11:14,861 --> 00:11:15,140
comradery they ever experienced.
And so they,

261
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:20,150
that's something they come back to 
civilian life and are missing it in and 

262
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,770
it's part of what's so difficult about 
coming back

263
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,920
and that's why you see them there.
A lot of risk taking behavior among a 

264
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,040
vets.
Um,

265
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:34,330
because I know that you're looking for 
another way to get that hit of 

266
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:34,620
adrenaline for sure.
There was a,

267
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:37,370
there was a book,
and I'm blanking on the name,

268
00:11:37,371 --> 00:11:41,570
is a great book written by a much more 
experienced war correspondent to me that

269
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:46,280
he used the phrase war is a drug and 
that to me sums it up,

270
00:11:46,281 --> 00:11:51,281
at least in my experience,
I got hooked on the experience of being 

271
00:11:51,281 --> 00:11:55,650
in these really elevated,
heightened situations,

272
00:11:55,651 --> 00:12:00,460
cinematic dramatic situations and I 
would come home and I just,

273
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:05,600
I didn't know what to do to replace it.
And so this synthetic squirt of 

274
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,890
adrenaline that you can get from cocaine
seem to do it for me,

275
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:14,160
obviously had tremendously negative 
consequences and so I wouldn't recommend

276
00:12:14,471 --> 00:12:16,720
it,
but I see why people do this.

277
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:21,220
So how did you,
how did you bounce back?

278
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:27,420
That was actually the question you asked
me before that I somehow neglected to 

279
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,450
answer.
So the doctor who pointed out that I was

280
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:32,800
an idiot and doing drugs and it caused a
panic attack.

281
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:38,140
Uh,
I agreed he didn't think I needed to go 

282
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:38,350
to rehab because it was the,
it was pretty short lived.

283
00:12:38,351 --> 00:12:43,351
It was.
I was in my early thirties when I 

284
00:12:43,351 --> 00:12:44,761
started on.
Still in my early thirties when I had a 

285
00:12:44,761 --> 00:12:44,761
panic attack and so it was only a couple
of years,

286
00:12:44,761 --> 00:12:46,570
he said,
just have wanting to come see me once or

287
00:12:46,571 --> 00:12:51,571
twice a week forever,
forever basically saying it.

288
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:55,080
He said basically indefinitely.
So I still say it,

289
00:12:55,081 --> 00:12:56,050
but not,
not.

290
00:12:56,051 --> 00:12:57,130
Yeah,
it's a good business model,

291
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:58,960
but not that.
I mean it's been,

292
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:02,110
well north of a,
it's been about 13 years,

293
00:13:02,111 --> 00:13:07,111
so I don't see them that often now,
but for a long time I saw him 

294
00:13:07,111 --> 00:13:08,490
intensively so that,
you know,

295
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,170
it wasn't easy.
It's not easy and I wouldn't have,

296
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:16,290
I wouldn't call what I mean,
there are people who have had drug 

297
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:18,010
addictions that are vastly more severe 
than mine.

298
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,680
Um,
but it's,

299
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:23,790
it sucks to stop a habit that is giving 
you pleasure on,

300
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:24,760
you know,
pretty,

301
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,960
pretty prominent areas of your brain 
while you're

302
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:32,130
situation.
What you're talking about is very,

303
00:13:32,131 --> 00:13:33,780
very,
very extreme situation.

304
00:13:33,781 --> 00:13:36,000
Like being a journalist,
a war correspondent,

305
00:13:36,001 --> 00:13:41,001
going over there,
experiencing that intense sort of 

306
00:13:41,001 --> 00:13:42,510
adrenaline rush and then having your,
your issues with it.

307
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:48,170
But it seems like there's a tremendous 
amount of people today that are 

308
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:50,430
stimulating themselves.
Adderall.

309
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:52,280
It was a big one.
I mean it's just A.

310
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:57,290
I know I've,
I've found out recently like four or 

311
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:59,511
five people that I didn't know that were
on adderall and it seems like you just 

312
00:13:59,511 --> 00:14:02,010
sort of start asking questions and you 
find out how many people.

313
00:14:02,011 --> 00:14:07,011
I mean all these,
my kid goes to school with a bunch of 

314
00:14:07,011 --> 00:14:11,181
other kids and you get to meet the 
parents and like fucking half of them 

315
00:14:11,181 --> 00:14:11,520
were on adderall.
It's very weird.

316
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:15,300
And adderall is a form of amphetamine 
and it seems like,

317
00:14:15,301 --> 00:14:17,280
um,
it just,

318
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,190
it's mind boggling how many people are 
doing this stuff.

319
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:25,380
We're dosing ourselves with all sorts of
things so it can be stimulated 

320
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:28,270
stimulants,
but it also can be a Benzos,

321
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,010
you know,
cousins of Valium.

322
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,830
Um,
it can be shopping,

323
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:35,330
gambling,
it can be a,

324
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:39,540
a whatever except the twitter.
Um,

325
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,640
and I think it,
just speaking,

326
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:45,040
we have a neuroscientist in the room,
so I'll let him say more about this.

327
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:49,300
And also a guy who's more experienced 
practitioner of Buddhism that I am.

328
00:14:49,301 --> 00:14:50,140
But,
but,

329
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,040
you know,
it does speak to the nature of the

330
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:57,040
human mind that we're always on the hunt
for the next little hit of dopamine and 

331
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:59,300
now there are lots of ways to get it.
Well,

332
00:14:59,301 --> 00:15:01,670
it's also very bizarre that you can just
do that.

333
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:07,010
I mean,
I don't think there's ever been a time 

334
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:08,711
in history where you could just take a 
pill and you'll be elevated for five or 

335
00:15:08,711 --> 00:15:13,181
six hours.
I mean that your doctor will give you 

336
00:15:13,181 --> 00:15:14,540
this pill and they'll encourage you to 
take it and then you'll find out that 50

337
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:16,190
percent of the people in your community 
and take it.

338
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:21,370
I've been,
I've done stories about parents who 

339
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:21,370
steal it from the kids.

340
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:22,100
Also just caffeine.
I mean I'm,

341
00:15:22,101 --> 00:15:23,830
you know,
I'm reaching for the coffee here,

342
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:28,660
having slept poorly last night.
But that is,

343
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,970
and that's just as much of a drug.
It's just not as.

344
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:34,630
It's not as potent.
The drug is taken methamphetamine or,

345
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:39,690
or,
or adderall or anything else that's a 

346
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:39,690
drug drug.
But,

347
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:40,070
um,
mean as a whole,

348
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:45,110
this,
this had civilizational consequences 

349
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:45,110
when,
when humanity,

350
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:48,580
more or less switched from alcohol in 
the morning to caffeine in the morning,

351
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:53,940
that's just,
things got a lot different than we used 

352
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:53,940
for,
for hundreds of years.

353
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:56,230
People were just drinking ale and wine 
in the morning,

354
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,430
uh,
before,

355
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:01,000
before coffee and tea became huge in 
Europe.

356
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,020
And,
and it,

357
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,770
it kind of colonialism the,
the,

358
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:08,650
the engine of colonialism to a 
significant degree was coffee,

359
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,000
tea,
sugar,

360
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:12,140
and,
you know,

361
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,990
things are behavior changed.

362
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,270
So people that were drinking ale and 
wine weren't,

363
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:21,330
wasn't a big part of it.
The reason why they drank it with food 

364
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:21,330
is because the water would get stagnant.

365
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:26,330
Yeah.
Well there's the issue with clean water 

366
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:26,330
too.
Yeah.

367
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:26,970
Yeah.
But when,

368
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:29,390
if just imagine the consequences of you 
and everyone,

369
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:34,400
you know,
getting up in the morning and just 

370
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:34,400
starting with beer or wine

371
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,070
that

372
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:39,140
long day or a very short one.
Yeah.

373
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,510
So,
um,

374
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,590
but yeah,
it's.

375
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:47,310
But the fundamental point of the 
underlying neuroscience is that all of 

376
00:16:50,171 --> 00:16:52,460
these drugs,
anything you're putting into your body,

377
00:16:52,461 --> 00:16:54,340
it is modifying the behavior of your 
brain,

378
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:59,370
is only modifying the existing available
neurochemistry of your brain.

379
00:16:59,801 --> 00:17:04,801
I mean the these,
these molecules either gets your brain 

380
00:17:04,801 --> 00:17:08,791
to secrete more of an existing 
neurotransmitter or they mimic an 

381
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:12,961
existing neurotransmitter binding to the
same receptor site where they keep 

382
00:17:12,961 --> 00:17:13,930
something in play longer than it would 
otherwise have been,

383
00:17:13,931 --> 00:17:18,910
that they block the uptake of of 
neurotransmitters or neuromodulators.

384
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:23,200
So it's not.
You're a drug is never get in your brain

385
00:17:23,201 --> 00:17:26,640
to do something.
Your brain is incapable of doing so.

386
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:31,300
And that's the most extreme thing,
like dmt or Lsd in the brain.

387
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:36,330
The brain is still doing all of that.
And so it stands to reason that there 

388
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:39,730
are potentially other ways of getting 
the brain to do that.

389
00:17:39,731 --> 00:17:44,731
Whether it's meditation or whether it's 
computer interface ultimately to the 

390
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:49,351
brain.
People who are interested in in brain 

391
00:17:49,351 --> 00:17:52,471
computer interface that not only allows 
a quadriplegic to move a robotic arm or 

392
00:17:55,290 --> 00:18:00,290
gets a a,
a Parkinson's patient to be able to 

393
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:00,840
move.
But you know,

394
00:18:00,841 --> 00:18:02,310
the,
to the ultimate degree,

395
00:18:02,311 --> 00:18:07,311
I mean actually augmenting human 
function that's a or opening landscapes 

396
00:18:08,161 --> 00:18:12,990
of mind,
psychedelic and otherwise that have been

397
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:13,860
unexplored.
I mean,

398
00:18:13,861 --> 00:18:14,820
all,
all of that is

399
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:16,140
um,

400
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:22,480
in principle possible because again,
we're just talking about electro 

401
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,490
chemical phenomenon happening in our 
heads which are being,

402
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,810
which is just there to be

403
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:31,970
modulator.
Now when you were talking about being 

404
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:34,671
depressed and Sam,
you're talking about re uptake 

405
00:18:34,671 --> 00:18:34,680
inhibitors,
I want to know what are your,

406
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:39,710
what are your thoughts on the massive 
amount of people there are on Ssri is 

407
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:41,880
now.
I mean this is another thing that I know

408
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:47,120
how many people I know that I'm either 
on or have been on some sort of 

409
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,210
antidepressants and it seems,
I mean to the layman,

410
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:55,250
to me,
to someone who's never taken them or 

411
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,160
doesn't have personal experience with it
massively overprescribed.

412
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:02,380
Yeah.
Well anything I say is with the caveat 

413
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:02,380
that this is.
I mean,

414
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,860
I'm not a neurologist.
I don't have.

415
00:19:03,861 --> 00:19:08,861
No.
I have zero clinical experience and I'm 

416
00:19:08,861 --> 00:19:12,810
certainly not my area.
I'm not up on the recent literature on 

417
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:16,750
the efficacy of antidepressants,
but there is clearly,

418
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:21,770
it's like anything,
there's a spectrum.

419
00:19:21,771 --> 00:19:26,771
There are people who have been 
unambiguously helped by antidepressants 

420
00:19:26,771 --> 00:19:27,980
and there are people who are on them who
shouldn't be on them,

421
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:30,320
you know,
and there are people who are on them who

422
00:19:30,321 --> 00:19:33,500
wants to get off them and find it 
surprisingly difficult to get off them.

423
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:34,600
And it's uh,
it's just,

424
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:40,080
it's,
these are blunt instruments by by 

425
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,651
definition because it's anything that's 
modulating serotonin in this case is 

426
00:19:47,301 --> 00:19:51,320
effective everywhere.
Serotonin is effective and it's just,

427
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,810
there's no magical property of

428
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:55,790
have a

429
00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:02,470
finding the neuromodulator where,
where only the symptoms you want to 

430
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:04,520
relieve our effect because these,
these,

431
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:10,070
these chemicals do a lot of things and a
lot of places and even in your gut,

432
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:15,130
right?
So it's not said that hence the side 

433
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:15,130
effects you get with almost any 
medication.

434
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:20,120
And we would have to get,
it would be in many respects as a matter

435
00:20:20,121 --> 00:20:25,121
of luck to find a pharmacological target
that actually does just what you want it

436
00:20:27,201 --> 00:20:29,140
to do.
Because it just to say that,

437
00:20:29,141 --> 00:20:34,141
that those receptors are not elsewhere,
that are going to reduce side effects 

438
00:20:34,141 --> 00:20:34,141
for you.
So,

439
00:20:34,141 --> 00:20:34,740
um,
that,

440
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:38,630
that's why a different kind of a 
intervention,

441
00:20:38,631 --> 00:20:43,631
something like ultimately some,
some electrical or magnetic or,

442
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:49,570
or a machine based could be more 
targeted because then you're,

443
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:53,890
you're not just putting something in the
bloodstream that spreads everywhere.

444
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:56,520
Bye Bye.
Machine based.

445
00:20:56,521 --> 00:21:01,521
You mean something like electrodes that 
they put on the mind to or the surface 

446
00:21:01,521 --> 00:21:01,860
of the head to stimulate areas of the 
brain.

447
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,810
Yeah.
Yeah.

448
00:21:02,811 --> 00:21:07,811
And again,
what we have now is also still pretty 

449
00:21:07,811 --> 00:21:10,841
primitive and anything that you would 
have that would be super futuristic 

450
00:21:11,691 --> 00:21:16,691
wouldn't seem to require that you,
you put something actually inside your 

451
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:17,390
head,
right?

452
00:21:17,391 --> 00:21:22,391
So whether that's a neurosurgery or I'm 
putting something into the bloodstream 

453
00:21:23,511 --> 00:21:27,730
that somehow gets inside your head what 
it is an injectable,

454
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,080
um,
you know.

455
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,200
So for instance,
Elon Musk just mentioned something 

456
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,270
called a which he called neural lace,
which is a,

457
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,530
believe a term that came from a Scifi 
novel.

458
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:42,740
I don't think it originates with him.
I'm not a big science fiction reader,

459
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,710
but he's got a,
uh,

460
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:48,500
he announced an investment in a company 
called neuro neuro link,

461
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:53,620
which is looking at looking at some 
advanced brain computer interface,

462
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:59,240
uh,
based on the idea that you could get a 

463
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,530
way with the,
with these new micro electrodes,

464
00:22:00,531 --> 00:22:05,531
you can get an injectable Mesh like a,
like a wire mesh that just integrates 

465
00:22:06,771 --> 00:22:11,240
with the brain or very likely just the 
cortex.

466
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:14,480
Uh,
and I believe this work has already been

467
00:22:14,481 --> 00:22:18,070
done in mice and the mice are,
you know,

468
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:22,010
have survived and are living with,
with this mesh in there in their brains.

469
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,510
And again,
this is not research.

470
00:22:23,511 --> 00:22:25,760
I'm close to it all.
I'm in and he just announced it a couple

471
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,200
of weeks ago.
But,

472
00:22:27,201 --> 00:22:29,420
um,
in principle,

473
00:22:29,421 --> 00:22:29,910
yeah,
you're,

474
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:34,160
you're talking about having a,
whether it's a mesh or whether it's,

475
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:39,210
it's a bag neato electric particles and 
it's something that is on site around 

476
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,880
individual neurons or assemblages of 
neurons which can both read out and 

477
00:22:46,881 --> 00:22:50,630
input wirelessly signal from those 
neurons.

478
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,830
So just both,
you know,

479
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,340
putting your thoughts into the world by,
you know,

480
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:01,120
influencing effectors,
a robotic arms or cursors on screens or 

481
00:23:01,521 --> 00:23:06,521
whatever it is,
and also influencing your mind based on 

482
00:23:06,521 --> 00:23:07,130
whatever

483
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,760
puts you want to put in there from the 
world,

484
00:23:09,761 --> 00:23:11,760
whether that's Doug mentions,
hack you and yeah,

485
00:23:11,761 --> 00:23:12,880
exactly.
Well that opens,

486
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:14,700
it opens all of those concerns.
You know,

487
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:16,450
the Russians,
it's always the Russians,

488
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:21,900
Chinese gambling.
I think the Chinese people are 

489
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,760
responsible for a lot of the propaganda 
that makes us think about the Russians.

490
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:25,510
Just push it off on them,
push it off on them.

491
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:27,880
Um,
I'm prepared to blame the Russians for a

492
00:23:27,881 --> 00:23:29,220
lot at this point.
Blame a law.

493
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:32,770
What a slippery slope though for humans 
becoming cyborgs.

494
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:37,830
I mean we're,
we're already like some weird form of 

495
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:37,830
semi hot right now.
Karen,

496
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:38,260
our cell phones,
like it's a baby,

497
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:43,650
you know,
like you leave your cell phone or home 

498
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:43,650
like,
oh my God,

499
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:43,650
I forgot the baby.
I mean it's a very strange thing that we

500
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:48,511
already have and there's not a whole lot
of steps between that and snapchat 

501
00:23:48,531 --> 00:23:49,010
glasses.

502
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:54,010
Jamie's got the snapchat glasses and 
seeing those things I didn't know they 

503
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:55,240
existed.
The other very strange they are.

504
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:58,090
They have little cameras on them and now
you to go ahead,

505
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:58,980
throw them on.
So.

506
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:03,660
But now he knows how to use them.
Google glass just was totally still born

507
00:24:03,661 --> 00:24:04,250
right?
I mean I didn't.

508
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,180
Yeah,
it didn't work.

509
00:24:05,181 --> 00:24:05,850
So He's,
he's,

510
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:08,930
he's transmitting or he's making a video
right now with that left side.

511
00:24:08,931 --> 00:24:12,950
See how the left side of spinning with 
snapchat do like 15 seconds,

512
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:15,080
10 seconds at 10.
A little counter.

513
00:24:15,081 --> 00:24:20,081
It's just flashing.
Was like the last three seconds and you 

514
00:24:20,081 --> 00:24:22,061
can hit it again and do another 20 
seconds so you can hold it and do like 

515
00:24:22,061 --> 00:24:22,061
30 seconds or something like that.
Yeah.

516
00:24:22,061 --> 00:24:26,910
Step one.
Is that spinning just to alert the 

517
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:26,910
people you're looking at that

518
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:31,550
to sort of alert me to,
to let me know that my recording is 

519
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:34,731
done.
Probably a little bit to let you know 

520
00:24:34,731 --> 00:24:36,201
too,
but that's probably the only 

521
00:24:36,201 --> 00:24:37,701
notification.
You know that I'm recording and it just 

522
00:24:37,701 --> 00:24:40,000
posts.
It doesn't post automatically and now I 

523
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,000
have to link it to my phone and then 
post it from there.

524
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,620
Okay.
The Google glass thing made people very 

525
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:44,620
uncomfortable.
I mean I,

526
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:49,360
I tried to very early prototype.
I have a good friend of mine who was a 

527
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,030
executive at Google at the time and she 
got ahold of one of the really early 

528
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:54,980
ones that actually had to be tethered by
a cord and you know,

529
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:58,170
you talk to it and swipe it and I played
with it a couple of times and we used it

530
00:24:58,171 --> 00:25:03,171
once at a ufc way in where I put it on 
and I broadcast from the way and it's 

531
00:25:03,171 --> 00:25:03,330
very,
very odd.

532
00:25:03,331 --> 00:25:05,400
But it made people made people very 
uncomfortable.

533
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,730
Like you could see the difference when 
they saw you with that thing on all of a

534
00:25:08,731 --> 00:25:12,180
sudden there was all this apprehension.
They're being recorded,

535
00:25:12,181 --> 00:25:15,510
are transmitted or.
But how long?

536
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:18,000
How long do we have where we're still 
people?

537
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:23,530
Well,
how long before you asked that question?

538
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,850
Our sense of private.
I remember,

539
00:25:27,851 --> 00:25:32,851
I remember what it was like to be 
neurotic about the sound of your voice 

540
00:25:32,851 --> 00:25:34,870
on a voicemail or Laura on the answering
machine,

541
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:39,890
right?
Like rerecording the outgoing message 

542
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:42,661
and,
and just just being worried about your 

543
00:25:42,661 --> 00:25:42,661
voice showing up and someone else's 
tape.

544
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:45,850
Right.
And now we were living in this pan optic

545
00:25:45,851 --> 00:25:50,851
on surveillance society where you just 
assume you're on camera virtually every 

546
00:25:50,851 --> 00:25:55,051
moment or in public,
although I guess people don't think 

547
00:25:55,051 --> 00:25:55,280
about it all that much.
Um,

548
00:25:55,660 --> 00:26:00,660
yeah,
I mean I think we're the norms around 

549
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:04,230
privacy shift just because we get so 
much value from having the data 

550
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:05,980
ultimately

551
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:09,940
I guess,
but it just seems also like to just this

552
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:15,060
inexorable pole towards this connection 
we're going to have it.

553
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:19,570
It just seems like if you just,
if you take where we are now and sort of

554
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:21,730
look at all the data points and 
extrapolate,

555
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:23,140
it doesn't look good,

556
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,060
it just salt,
but it's both.

557
00:26:26,061 --> 00:26:29,570
It's both bad and good.
The fake news thing is horrible,

558
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:34,630
but the ability to fact check in,
to be able to pick up your phone and 

559
00:26:35,661 --> 00:26:39,500
find out what's true is has also never 
been better,

560
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:44,530
so it's like we're both vulnerable in a 
way that we've never been and where 

561
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:44,530
we're empowered

562
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:46,890
in a way that we've always been true,
but technological progress.

563
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:52,040
Yeah.
It just seems like there's a certain 

564
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:55,491
amount of time we have left before we 
give birth to some new thing we're 

565
00:26:55,491 --> 00:26:58,330
talking about just integrating ourselves
biologically with,

566
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:02,730
with our machines and also something 
that's independent of us,

567
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,920
some artificial intelligence independent
of us.

568
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:10,130
You want,
you want to look for some fear around 

569
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:10,130
that.
You got the right guy,

570
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:10,130
right?
Yeah.

571
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:10,780
Well we've talked about Evan's past 
those fears here.

572
00:27:10,781 --> 00:27:11,550
Yeah.
Yeah.

573
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:14,580
I mean Josh has apps freaked me out this
morning,

574
00:27:14,581 --> 00:27:19,050
sent me some articles about the self 
driving trucks that are already going in

575
00:27:19,051 --> 00:27:24,051
Australia that are as big as a seven 67 
and they're driving down the road by 

576
00:27:24,051 --> 00:27:26,490
themselves with cargo,
probably nuclear waste or something.

577
00:27:26,491 --> 00:27:28,530
You know,
just to wind down the road,

578
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,130
but people are so bad at it.

579
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,870
Driving that,
yeah,

580
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:38,050
the robots just have to get reliably 
better than people and then you'll just 

581
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:39,410
feel nothing but relief.
They probably already are yet.

582
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,260
Well,
yeah,

583
00:27:40,261 --> 00:27:43,170
I mean they're.
I think they probably are,

584
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:48,380
as far as I know from what I hear from 
Tesla that yeah,

585
00:27:48,931 --> 00:27:50,180
the,
the accident,

586
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:55,370
the man hours,
they have people using the autopilot in 

587
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:55,370
the autopilots not at all.
Perfect.

588
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:57,990
Obviously two people have died already 
from,

589
00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:03,050
from using it badly,
but still they have something like some 

590
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:07,710
millions of man hours.
You have autopilot assisted driving and 

591
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:10,710
I think that is has been safer than just
pure ape.

592
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,870
Did you see the video of the guy who 
fell asleep in traffic in San Francisco?

593
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:19,910
He's literally out cold and his car is 
driving on the highway kind of fit.

594
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:22,610
I mean he's just some guy on his way to 
work,

595
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,330
just pass out completely mouth open and 
people are filming them.

596
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:30,170
His cars driving down the road and 
actually probably the people filming him

597
00:28:30,171 --> 00:28:32,450
or doing the.
The more dangerous thing.

598
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,240
You're right.
Yeah.

599
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:36,830
Well texting and driving drive me crazy 
to see it.

600
00:28:36,831 --> 00:28:38,870
Like to be in an uber now you can look 
around,

601
00:28:38,871 --> 00:28:41,180
you can see how many people are texting.
Yeah.

602
00:28:41,181 --> 00:28:43,370
Including your driver sometimes.
Yeah.

603
00:28:43,371 --> 00:28:44,520
That drives me crazy.
I.

604
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:49,780
Here's the guy that dude's Alcoa is cars
creeping along and stop and go traffic 

605
00:28:52,821 --> 00:28:55,400
and he is completely alcohol.
Wow.

606
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:59,900
Well it works.
The autopilot works.

607
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:00,830
Yeah.
No,

608
00:29:00,831 --> 00:29:02,570
it does work.
Yeah.

609
00:29:02,571 --> 00:29:04,100
Texting and driving scares the shit out 
of me.

610
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:09,130
That pokemon go thing.
Thank God that that died off but 

611
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:12,740
stopped.
I was driving on the highway and there 

612
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:12,860
was a woman to the left of us and I 
noticed that she was being,

613
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,750
her face was illuminated by her cell 
phone.

614
00:29:14,751 --> 00:29:17,750
So I look over and she's playing pokemon
as she's driving.

615
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,210
So I guess I don't know how pokemon 
works,

616
00:29:20,211 --> 00:29:24,620
but I guess you pick up things and as 
you're driving you get stuff.

617
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:28,150
And so she was playing the game while 
she was on the hot,

618
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:31,520
barely paying attention to the road.
Looking at her phone.

619
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,640
This is the argument for,
for robot drivers.

620
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:35,690
Yeah.
Yeah.

621
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:41,710
And also it will open up and when you 
are ultimately being driven safely,

622
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,580
buy a car that you trust more than you 
trust yourself.

623
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,710
Then just imagine the,
the,

624
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:52,740
the information consumption,
entertainment options that open up 

625
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:52,740
there.
You'll watch movies,

626
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:53,460
you'll,
you'll,

627
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:58,530
you'll listen to podcasts,
you'll get work done and it will become 

628
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:01,951
a space of more not,
we're not gonna miss having to pay 

629
00:30:01,951 --> 00:30:02,290
attention to the road.
You know,

630
00:30:02,291 --> 00:30:06,640
maybe maybe there's some people want to 
drive recreationally for some reason,

631
00:30:06,641 --> 00:30:08,530
but um,
it's,

632
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:12,970
it will just be a new space where you 
won't believe that 40,000

633
00:30:12,971 --> 00:30:17,260
people every year were dying because we 
couldn't figure out how to drive safely.

634
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:20,670
But isn't that a slippery slope like 
$40,000?

635
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:23,560
Well that's a great thing that 40,000
people are not going to die.

636
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,470
But the idea that we're going gonna stop
people from driving a car,

637
00:30:26,471 --> 00:30:27,760
you're gonna have to live with these 
40,000

638
00:30:27,761 --> 00:30:30,610
people.
That's not what I was going to say,

639
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:35,850
but I was gonna say,
I mean pretty much all the things that 

640
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:35,850
people do.

641
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:38,530
And then it's going to get down to why 
have people mean ultimately that's the.

642
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:41,890
When I look at the event horizon of 
artificial intelligence,

643
00:30:41,891 --> 00:30:44,700
it's why,
why would we were so far?

644
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:49,980
We're not going to get our shit together
by the time artificial intelligence is 

645
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:53,430
given birth to.
While that that all goes to what we 

646
00:30:55,691 --> 00:30:58,570
build,
we build artificial intelligence that is

647
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:04,440
independent of us and seems conscious 
and is more powerful than us.

648
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:09,460
Well then we are.
We have built a in limit.

649
00:31:09,461 --> 00:31:14,461
We have essentially built a god that we 
now have to be in relationship to and 

650
00:31:14,461 --> 00:31:18,391
hopefully that works out well for us.
And it's very easy to see how it might 

651
00:31:18,391 --> 00:31:23,251
not.
I think they're even scarier cases in 

652
00:31:23,251 --> 00:31:23,320
that that we could build something that 
has like power,

653
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:26,050
but there's no reason.
I think it's conscious.

654
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,160
It's just,
it's just,

655
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:29,950
it's no more conscious than our current 
computers,

656
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:35,370
which is to say that intelligence and 
consciousness may be separable 

657
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:36,460
phenomenon that you could.

658
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:41,460
Intelligence can scale,
but consciousness need not come along 

659
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:44,941
for the ride.
And that for me is the worst case 

660
00:31:44,941 --> 00:31:45,940
scenario because we inherit all of the 
danger of,

661
00:31:45,941 --> 00:31:47,980
of,
of this,

662
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:51,130
the power of this system being 
misaligned with our interest.

663
00:31:51,131 --> 00:31:54,400
We could build something that is godlike
in its power.

664
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:56,190
And yet,
uh,

665
00:31:57,090 --> 00:32:02,090
we,
we could essentially be canceling the 

666
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:04,291
prospects of the evolution of 
consciousness because of this thing 

667
00:32:04,291 --> 00:32:04,500
wipes us out that,
you know,

668
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:06,730
I think it's,
I'm Nick Bostrom,

669
00:32:06,731 --> 00:32:10,000
the philosopher who wrote a great book 
on this entitled Superintelligence,

670
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:13,580
I think he calls this the Disneyland 
without children and were like,

671
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:14,800
well,
basically we could build this,

672
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:19,950
this incredibly powerful,
intelligent landscape that continues to 

673
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:26,850
refine itself and its own powers.
Uh,

674
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,070
who knows what ways,
my ways perhaps that are,

675
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,170
that are unimaginable to us.
And yet they're,

676
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,350
the lights aren't on.
You know,

677
00:32:33,351 --> 00:32:33,700
there's,
there's,

678
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:38,870
there's nothing that is like to be this 
machine or system of machines is in the 

679
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:41,180
way that is probably nothing that has to
be the internet right now.

680
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:43,010
You think of all this going on,
on the Internet.

681
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:44,210
I,
you know,

682
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:47,720
I don't think the Internet is conscious 
of any of it right now.

683
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:52,750
The question is could the internet 
become conscious of what its thinking 

684
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:57,100
and um,
I think there's no reason to think it 

685
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:57,230
couldn't,
it's just we don't understand the,

686
00:32:57,410 --> 00:33:02,030
the physical basis of consciousness,
yet the real question is why would it do

687
00:33:02,031 --> 00:33:07,031
anything?
I mean if it doesn't have any of the 

688
00:33:07,031 --> 00:33:07,430
biological motivations that people have 
to breed and to stay alive and to,

689
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:12,450
you know,
fight or flight and to be nervous and 

690
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:14,980
this desire to carry on our genes mean 
if you really did build the ultimate 

691
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:18,720
supercomputer artificial intelligence 
that was beyond our capacity for reason 

692
00:33:19,221 --> 00:33:23,000
and understanding what niches do.
Nothing because everything is pointless.

693
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:23,620
Well,
no,

694
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:26,090
because what we would do,
we would program it,

695
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:28,970
it would do whatever we asked it to do 
initially,

696
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:29,220
right?

697
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:32,240
We things we program now have goals,
right?

698
00:33:32,241 --> 00:33:37,241
Your,
your thermostat is trying to regulate 

699
00:33:37,241 --> 00:33:37,241
the temperature in the room.
Um,

700
00:33:37,241 --> 00:33:38,540
and when get,
when it gets too warm,

701
00:33:38,541 --> 00:33:41,000
it kicks on the air and it,
when it gets too cold,

702
00:33:41,001 --> 00:33:41,930
it kicks on the heat.
And I mean,

703
00:33:41,931 --> 00:33:43,340
that's just it.
That's a goal,

704
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,050
right?
And um,

705
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,950
so we would,
we are everything we build.

706
00:33:48,951 --> 00:33:53,450
That's automated,
has goals explicitly programmed into it,

707
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:57,170
and when you're talking about a truly 
intelligent machine,

708
00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:02,950
it will have,
it will discover a goals that you have 

709
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:05,861
never programmed into it,
that are our intermediate to the goal 

710
00:34:05,861 --> 00:34:05,870
that you have programs.
So if,

711
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:10,900
if the goal of this machine is to pick 
up all the trash in this room and you 

712
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:19,240
physically try to stop it,
well then it's gonna try to get around 

713
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,120
you to pick up the rest of the trash and
the room.

714
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:20,560
Right?
So it's,

715
00:34:20,561 --> 00:34:21,530
it's,
you know,

716
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,720
this probably already true of a Roomba,
right?

717
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:25,300
I actually don't have a room,
but,

718
00:34:25,301 --> 00:34:30,301
but if you,
if you put something in the way of the 

719
00:34:30,301 --> 00:34:33,011
room,
but it's going to get around the thing 

720
00:34:33,011 --> 00:34:33,011
you have put in it's way so that it can 
get to the rest of the room.

721
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:38,500
So that's an intermediate goal.
And some of these goals need never have 

722
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:41,360
been explicitly thought about or 
represented,

723
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,620
which is to say programmed into it.
And yet they,

724
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:46,210
they're,
they're formed by,

725
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,950
by the fact that the thing has a 
longterm goal.

726
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:54,610
And one of the,
one of the concerns is that we could 

727
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:55,460
build something that has a longterm 
goal,

728
00:34:55,890 --> 00:34:59,030
build something that's super powerful,
that has a longterm goal,

729
00:34:59,031 --> 00:35:01,280
which in principle is benign,
right?

730
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:03,020
As executive,
this is something we want,

731
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:08,680
and yet it could discover instrumental 
goals that are deeply hostile to what we

732
00:35:09,681 --> 00:35:09,950
want.

733
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:11,960
I mean,
the thing doesn't have common sense,

734
00:35:11,961 --> 00:35:16,961
right?
We haven't figured out how to build 

735
00:35:16,961 --> 00:35:18,881
common sense into the machine so that 
the cartoon examples of this kind of 

736
00:35:19,011 --> 00:35:24,011
thing.
But one example that Ilan used when he 

737
00:35:24,011 --> 00:35:25,670
first was expressing fears about this,
if you built a machine,

738
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:29,390
the only goal of which was was to cancel
spam,

739
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:29,960
right?
No more.

740
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,250
We don't want it.
What we want.

741
00:35:31,251 --> 00:35:32,870
No more spam.
Get rid of the spam.

742
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:38,380
Well,
an easy way to get rid of spam is just 

743
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:39,120
killed all the people right now.
That's a crazy thing to think,

744
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:44,540
but it's not in unless you've built,
unless you've closed the door to that 

745
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:47,580
intermediate goal,
there's no reason to think that a

746
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,200
for powerful machine couldn't form such 
a goal.

747
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:55,620
My question would be,
if this super powerful machine has the 

748
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:55,870
ability to create new super powerful 
machines,

749
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:57,700
wouldn't use the same mandate,
would it,

750
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:01,330
would it still try to follow the 
original programming or would it realize

751
00:36:01,331 --> 00:36:06,100
that our original program is only 
instrumental to the success of the human

752
00:36:06,101 --> 00:36:10,330
race and it might think the human race 
is ridiculous and preposterous and why?

753
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:15,360
Why not just program something that it 
thinks is the ultimate intelligence?

754
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:20,680
Something beyond our capacity for 
reasoning and understanding now and that

755
00:36:20,681 --> 00:36:25,681
thing.
I would wonder in the absence of any 

756
00:36:25,681 --> 00:36:27,550
sort of biological motivations and the 
absence would mean.

757
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,080
Do you think of all the things that we 
do,

758
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:34,320
I mean you,
you break it down to what motivates 

759
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,140
people to get out of bed.
What motivates people to do good,

760
00:36:35,141 --> 00:36:40,141
but my sense of community,
a desire to breed the social status,

761
00:36:40,361 --> 00:36:42,370
all these different things that motivate
people to do things.

762
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:45,670
We remove all of those.
And what actions would it take?

763
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:47,260
Well,
I think,

764
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:52,380
I think you want to build it in a way 
that is focused on our wellbeing.

765
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:57,850
And so for instance,
I had Stuart Russell on my podcast,

766
00:36:57,851 --> 00:37:01,570
he's a computer scientist at Berkeley 
who,

767
00:37:01,571 --> 00:37:06,571
um,
unlike many computer scientists takes 

768
00:37:06,571 --> 00:37:07,840
this problem really seriously and has a 
thought a lot about it.

769
00:37:07,841 --> 00:37:12,841
And in his lab,
I believe they're working on a,

770
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:19,410
a way of thinking about safety that is,
that is open ended and flexible without,

771
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:25,640
without pretending we have any of the 
right answers in the near term or,

772
00:37:25,641 --> 00:37:30,641
or likely to have them.
So you want to build a system that wants

773
00:37:31,181 --> 00:37:34,330
to know what you want,
right at each point.

774
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:39,390
Like,
so that's tracking what humanity one 

775
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:42,840
wants in terms of its goals and wants to
stay aligned with whatever it is we 

776
00:37:44,291 --> 00:37:45,440
want,
um,

777
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:48,400
wants to,
wants to learn from what we seem to want

778
00:37:48,401 --> 00:37:49,690
based on our behavior.

779
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:51,450
But,
um,

780
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:53,890
and so there could be some kind of 
clarifying function.

781
00:37:53,891 --> 00:37:55,750
Where were we,
you know,

782
00:37:55,751 --> 00:38:00,751
we can get our priorities more aligned 
in dialogue with the super intelligent 

783
00:38:00,751 --> 00:38:04,891
machine.
But the bottom line is it always wants 

784
00:38:04,891 --> 00:38:09,211
to do it.
It doesn't think it knows what we want 

785
00:38:09,211 --> 00:38:12,720
and it continually wants to keep 
approximating better and better what we 

786
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,920
want.
And so from my point of view,

787
00:38:14,921 --> 00:38:19,921
the most crucial thing is you,
you always want the door to remain open 

788
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:23,620
to the statement.
Wait,

789
00:38:23,621 --> 00:38:23,980
wait,
wait.

790
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,810
That's not what I wanted.
Right?

791
00:38:25,811 --> 00:38:27,470
Like you wouldn't want to be in the 
presence of this.

792
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:32,490
God likes super power that will always 
take direction from you when say,

793
00:38:35,351 --> 00:38:35,710
wait,
wait,

794
00:38:35,711 --> 00:38:36,190
wait,
that's

795
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:38,990
not going in the right direction and 
this.

796
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,690
So the fear is we could build something 
that is,

797
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:45,700
is just not amenable to being controlled
in that way.

798
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:50,740
Is it not the case that computer 
scientists are starting to come around 

799
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:50,740
to the idea that there's real danger,
a,

800
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:53,680
potentially there's dangerous potential 
in,

801
00:38:53,681 --> 00:38:54,530
in,
in Ai.

802
00:38:54,531 --> 00:38:59,531
I mean,
I was listening to when you talked to 

803
00:38:59,531 --> 00:38:59,531
will macaskill a few weeks ago who was 
saying,

804
00:38:59,531 --> 00:38:59,531
you know,
we,

805
00:38:59,531 --> 00:39:01,820
it was,
it was just a few years from starting to

806
00:39:01,821 --> 00:39:04,880
think about how to split the atom to 
actually having a bomb.

807
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:09,300
Um,
are they not coming around the idea that

808
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,960
these,
that technology can progress much faster

809
00:39:11,961 --> 00:39:13,130
than we think of?

810
00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:14,150
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

811
00:39:14,151 --> 00:39:19,151
Well,
it's a whole spectrum of the people who 

812
00:39:19,151 --> 00:39:20,951
think that this is never going to happen
or it's so far away that thinking about 

813
00:39:20,951 --> 00:39:25,601
it now is completely irrational to 
people who are super worried and think 

814
00:39:25,851 --> 00:39:29,360
that huge changes are imminent.
And so it's just the spectrum.

815
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:31,160
I'm with the ladder.
Yeah.

816
00:39:31,161 --> 00:39:32,080
No,
it's as am I,

817
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,630
what my concern is not even with the 
initial construction,

818
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:39,470
like the initial ai,
my concern is with what the ai creates.

819
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:44,800
If we give the AI ability to improve 
upon itself and look at are irrational 

820
00:39:44,841 --> 00:39:48,080
thoughts and how we've programmed itself
to support the human race.

821
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:49,340
And then it might go,
well,

822
00:39:49,341 --> 00:39:52,160
why the fuck would I do that?
Like you guys are ridiculous.

823
00:39:52,161 --> 00:39:52,480
Like,
oh,

824
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:54,680
this is a new life form.
This is a new.

825
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:59,780
We've given birth to some incredibly 
potent new thing that we think of it as 

826
00:40:00,081 --> 00:40:01,310
artificial by.

827
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:03,020
I mean,
is it really,

828
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:06,290
it's just a form of life.
It's a form of life that we've created.

829
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:11,620
Human beings have sort of,
the analogy I always use is that we're 

830
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:15,731
some sort of an electronic caterpillar 
giving birth to some spectacular 

831
00:40:15,981 --> 00:40:18,590
butterfly we're not even aware of while 
we're building our cocoon.

832
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:23,920
We're just doing it.
I mean there's a caterpillar fully 

833
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:23,920
conscious of what it's doing when it 
makes that cocoon,

834
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:28,480
probably not,
but it just does and there's plenty of 

835
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,630
examples of that in nature of something 
that's doing something that's going 

836
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:32,660
through some metamorphosis that's 
completely unconscious.

837
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:36,290
My worry would be.
I guess it's not even really a worry.

838
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:41,620
It's more like looking at the 
possibility of the AI improving upon 

839
00:40:41,721 --> 00:40:46,721
itself and making a far better version 
than we could create like almost 

840
00:40:46,721 --> 00:40:47,390
instantaneously.
Right?

841
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:52,670
Isn't that if you give it the ability to
be autonomous and you give it the 

842
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:55,631
ability to innovate and to try to figure
out what's a better way around things 

843
00:40:55,631 --> 00:41:00,461
and what's a better way to program 
things and then make its own version of 

844
00:41:00,461 --> 00:41:00,461
what it is.

845
00:41:00,461 --> 00:41:02,720
It's going to be spectacular.
I mean it really will be just.

846
00:41:02,721 --> 00:41:05,720
I mean it's obviously just talking shit,
but really would be a god.

847
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:11,110
I mean,
you're talking about something that if 

848
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:11,570
we give it the ability to create,
we give it the ability to think,

849
00:41:11,571 --> 00:41:12,770
reason,
rationalize,

850
00:41:12,771 --> 00:41:16,040
and then build,
build something better.

851
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:21,350
I mean by bill,
you should be thinking more software 

852
00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:25,391
than hardware to make it there.
There's obviously there's anything is 

853
00:41:25,391 --> 00:41:28,361
possible.
Anything that can be built with 

854
00:41:28,361 --> 00:41:28,361
intelligence can be built with 
intelligence,

855
00:41:28,361 --> 00:41:31,520
so you could be talking about armies of 
robots and nanotechnology and everything

856
00:41:31,521 --> 00:41:32,120
else.
That's.

857
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:34,490
That is the staple

858
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:39,490
of the PSI Phi scare scenario,
but I'm more likely and certainly faster

859
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:46,150
and ultimately more powerful.
You're talking about something that can 

860
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:46,520
rewrite it's own code,
improve.

861
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:47,280
I mean it's,
it's,

862
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:52,310
it's the code that is that is dictating 
the intelligence and so you're talking 

863
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:55,160
about something that could be for the 
longest time,

864
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:58,730
invisible and just happening on the 
Internet,

865
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:01,510
right?
You're talking about code that could,

866
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:05,450
could be put into financial markets,
right?

867
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:10,400
Which could be built to be self 
modifying.

868
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:12,890
Right,
and then it's already out in the wild.

869
00:42:12,891 --> 00:42:17,891
It's not.
It's not sequestered in some air gapped 

870
00:42:17,891 --> 00:42:20,870
computer in a lab.
It's out there and it's changing itself.

871
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:25,900
Now.
That would be totally irresponsible 

872
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:25,900
thing to do from a,
from a,

873
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,160
uh,
a software designers point of view,

874
00:42:28,161 --> 00:42:30,350
I think at this point,
but um,

875
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:35,640
there's just no question that we're 
going to get to a place where I'm going.

876
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:40,740
It's either,
either it will be the province of one 

877
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:43,040
lab that gets there first or it will be 
open source,

878
00:42:43,041 --> 00:42:48,041
but you're talking about software rev,
US figuring out how to write better.

879
00:42:48,471 --> 00:42:53,471
It's better software which becomes the 
basis of general intelligence and then 

880
00:42:56,421 --> 00:42:58,910
where that gets put and what gets done 
with that.

881
00:42:58,911 --> 00:43:03,911
That's,
that's the question isn't in the real 

882
00:43:03,911 --> 00:43:05,900
question of also the race to see who can
come up with one first.

883
00:43:05,901 --> 00:43:08,720
I mean once,
once the idea gets put out there,

884
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:13,750
like the idea of the nuclear bomb.
I mean obviously no one in their right 

885
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:15,200
mind thinks it's a good idea to make a 
nuclear bomb.

886
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:20,470
What that story is.
Especially a sobering because I may 

887
00:43:20,511 --> 00:43:23,180
forget the,
the details.

888
00:43:23,181 --> 00:43:24,660
I think it was.
I couldn't,

889
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:27,200
I could have this backwards.
I think it was Rutherford,

890
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:32,950
the two famous physicists involve to 
Rutherford who said we're never going to

891
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:35,630
unlock the,
the,

892
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:36,530
the,
um,

893
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:38,250
I think,
yeah,

894
00:43:38,251 --> 00:43:43,251
I think it was Rutherford gave a talk 
saying that we're never going to unlock 

895
00:43:43,251 --> 00:43:46,620
the energy that we now know to be in the
Adam and Leo Szilard the next day 

896
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:50,630
produced the,
the,

897
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:55,780
uh,
the equations that I'm locked in the 

898
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:58,690
next,
next and an indirect response to this 

899
00:43:58,690 --> 00:43:58,690
announcement.

900
00:43:58,690 --> 00:43:58,690
Like,
okay,

901
00:43:58,690 --> 00:43:59,420
let's just wait.
That's bullshit.

902
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:02,210
And they gave him the next morning,
woke up and produce that.

903
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:06,230
They produced the math that gave us the,
the atomic bomb.

904
00:44:06,930 --> 00:44:11,930
So it's,
it can happen really fast and if you 

905
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:14,171
want to get those details exactly right.
Listen to what's Stuart Russell said on 

906
00:44:14,171 --> 00:44:14,180
my podcast.
Well,

907
00:44:14,181 --> 00:44:19,181
oppenheimer in like a really ironic 
twist wasn't a Buddhist.

908
00:44:20,430 --> 00:44:21,470
He.
No,

909
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,690
he was a fan of,
of um,

910
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:25,760
Hinduism.
Technically.

911
00:44:25,761 --> 00:44:29,240
I mean he was,
he taught himself Sanskrit apparently in

912
00:44:29,241 --> 00:44:32,460
three months.
One never how much this is exaggerated,

913
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:37,461
but his,
his publicists will tell you that he 

914
00:44:37,461 --> 00:44:39,720
taught himself Sanskrit in three months 
to read the Bhagavad Gita,

915
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:44,460
which is the one of the texts of,
of Hinduism,

916
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:48,720
the quote that he gave out as the first 
bomb was tested.

917
00:44:49,070 --> 00:44:52,050
I've become death,
death destroyer of worlds.

918
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:57,750
And then when you hear him saying it's 
even more creepy because you could see 

919
00:44:57,750 --> 00:44:57,750
the sort of remorse.

920
00:44:57,750 --> 00:44:59,060
And so have you seen it?
No.

921
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:03,630
I also get the photo.
Every photo of Oppenheimer.

922
00:45:03,930 --> 00:45:05,730
He looks,
he just looks haunted.

923
00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:08,460
Well,
he was hanging out with weird to see him

924
00:45:08,461 --> 00:45:13,461
with his general.
I was watching some documentary on the 

925
00:45:13,461 --> 00:45:13,590
creation of the atom bomb and he was,
uh,

926
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:18,780
you know,
it's hanging out with these generals as 

927
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:18,780
they're probably Curtis Lemay.
Yeah.

928
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:20,250
And you see the two of them together and
you're like,

929
00:45:20,251 --> 00:45:25,251
what a bizarre pairing.
Like this one monkey needs this other 

930
00:45:25,251 --> 00:45:28,140
genius to make this bomb so he can drop 
it on these people.

931
00:45:28,141 --> 00:45:30,000
And the guy realizes that if he doesn't 
make it,

932
00:45:30,001 --> 00:45:32,190
someone's going to make it and it could 
be dropped on them.

933
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:34,920
And that's,
that's the thing we are,

934
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:38,070
we were genuinely in a race condition 
there and we,

935
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:41,010
and we didn't know how close the Nazis 
were.

936
00:45:41,011 --> 00:45:43,020
It turns out that they weren't as close 
as we feared.

937
00:45:43,021 --> 00:45:45,810
But yeah,
just imagine Hitler haven't gotten there

938
00:45:45,811 --> 00:45:46,440
first.
Right.

939
00:45:46,441 --> 00:45:49,470
With the help of Heisenberg and others 
play at Jamie

940
00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:13,930
scripture,
the game test persuade to pressed him 

941
00:46:28,070 --> 00:46:33,070
takes on form.
Now I ended up coming to worlds.

942
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,890
He does not look like a happy dude.
What a,

943
00:46:45,891 --> 00:46:48,920
what a burden.
But it's actually,

944
00:46:49,370 --> 00:46:53,000
I read the history of that,
that effort,

945
00:46:53,001 --> 00:46:54,920
the Manhattan project and the Trinity 
Test.

946
00:46:55,560 --> 00:47:00,560
It is super sobering because there was,
they move forward in,

947
00:47:02,290 --> 00:47:07,290
in a context of real uncertainty about 
what was going to happen.

948
00:47:07,881 --> 00:47:11,780
I mean there were they,
in terms of the yield of the first bomb,

949
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:15,380
there was a,
a range,

950
00:47:15,381 --> 00:47:20,381
I think of a,
a hundred fold difference of opinion of 

951
00:47:20,381 --> 00:47:20,990
what they were going to get.
This thing went off.

952
00:47:21,610 --> 00:47:26,610
Um,
and there were some people who still 

953
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:29,710
placed some possibility a on the 
prospect of igniting the atmosphere.

954
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:38,851
Yeah.
And just canceling all of life right 

955
00:47:38,851 --> 00:47:38,851
now,
they had,

956
00:47:38,851 --> 00:47:39,250
they had spent a lot of time to,
I mean,

957
00:47:39,251 --> 00:47:41,590
they did something like due diligence 
where they were,

958
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:46,120
many of them were confident it wouldn't,
but that was not without,

959
00:47:46,510 --> 00:47:49,630
beyond the realm of possibility for some
of the people working on it.

960
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:51,660
And um,
so we,

961
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:56,680
we have shown a propensity for taking 
possibly existential risks to develop 

962
00:48:00,131 --> 00:48:02,890
new technology because there's,
there's a reason to develop it.

963
00:48:02,891 --> 00:48:07,640
And in this case,
the destruct,

964
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:11,860
the destructive potential is so obvious 
because it's all destructive potential.

965
00:48:11,861 --> 00:48:12,180
I mean,
we're,

966
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:15,250
we're building the biggest bombs we 
possibly can build.

967
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:18,140
And so it,
it's just,

968
00:48:18,810 --> 00:48:21,460
it's not difficult to think about the 
danger.

969
00:48:21,461 --> 00:48:22,720
It's all danger,
right?

970
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:24,460
Um,
and these bombs,

971
00:48:24,510 --> 00:48:29,510
you know,
now getting into the hands of the wrong 

972
00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:31,261
people with Ai,
it's so seductive because if you looked 

973
00:48:32,141 --> 00:48:33,030
at it,
looked at in,

974
00:48:33,050 --> 00:48:34,210
in,
in one light,

975
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:38,530
it's just all upside and there's nothing
better than intelligence is nothing more

976
00:48:38,531 --> 00:48:41,680
intrinsically desirable than 
intelligence.

977
00:48:41,950 --> 00:48:45,010
And so to get more of it is,
seems an intrinsic good.

978
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:48,100
And so it takes an extra step to say,
well,

979
00:48:48,101 --> 00:48:51,310
wait a minute,
this could in fact be the most dangerous

980
00:48:51,311 --> 00:48:53,710
thing we've ever done.
And you have to,

981
00:48:53,770 --> 00:48:56,770
you have to.
You have to spend a lot of time fighting

982
00:48:56,771 --> 00:49:01,771
that,
that ideological battle with people who 

983
00:49:01,771 --> 00:49:01,771
just think,
no,

984
00:49:01,771 --> 00:49:04,200
just this is just all upside.
This is what could be.

985
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,730
What could go wrong.
You're just,

986
00:49:06,731 --> 00:49:11,731
you're just scare mongering and the year
just evil that you've seen too many 

987
00:49:11,731 --> 00:49:11,731
terminator movies.

988
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:16,000
Is that even possible to.
No,

989
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:17,570
not.
Not with the first.

990
00:49:17,571 --> 00:49:18,900
The first was good.
First one.

991
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:24,520
Second was good.
There's one in there that I don't think 

992
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:25,820
I've seen all of the three or four.
I don't know.

993
00:49:25,850 --> 00:49:30,850
Like I think it was.
I think I lost touch after the second 

994
00:49:30,850 --> 00:49:30,850
I've seen.
I haven't seen any more than two.

995
00:49:31,570 --> 00:49:32,870
I,
I dunno,

996
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:37,960
I just,
I feel like it's been because of the 

997
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:38,620
race because the idea that there's a 
race to get to it,

998
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:43,340
it seems like it's inevitable that 
someone actually does create it and much

999
00:49:43,341 --> 00:49:46,160
like the atomic bomb,
it'll probably launched,

1000
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:51,250
probably be launched without a true 
understanding of what his potential is.

1001
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:55,130
That's my fear.
I'm terrified of it.

1002
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:56,340
I think about it all the time.
I,

1003
00:49:56,341 --> 00:49:59,780
I stepped back sometimes and I look at 
like the city of Los Angeles,

1004
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:01,820
of the skyline.
All the lights go off and I'm like,

1005
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,500
this,
this is all new.

1006
00:50:03,590 --> 00:50:05,680
Like this has only been here for a few 
hundred years like this,

1007
00:50:05,681 --> 00:50:07,250
this,
there was nothing here.

1008
00:50:07,550 --> 00:50:09,140
1,700,
there was nothing.

1009
00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:10,430
This is nothing.
Now look at it,

1010
00:50:10,431 --> 00:50:13,730
it's all lit up and there's a gigantic 
grid you see from the sky,

1011
00:50:13,731 --> 00:50:15,890
like what are we looking at 300 years 
from now?

1012
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:21,460
Like what?
What are we looking at with all these 

1013
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:21,460
things that were feverously attempting 
to build and create.

1014
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:22,920
Yeah.
Well the,

1015
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:27,920
our dependence on the net is sobering.
I mean,

1016
00:50:27,921 --> 00:50:32,050
just what you just forget about all of 
these highfalutin fears of,

1017
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:34,030
of roguey.
I just,

1018
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:39,070
just,
we don't have a backup for the Internet 

1019
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:40,070
and the Internet goes down.
What happens in the real world a lot.

1020
00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:43,130
That is,
that is very difficult to recover from.

1021
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:45,260
You know,
what happens to your money,

1022
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:45,910
right?
I mean,

1023
00:50:45,911 --> 00:50:50,911
what is money when there is no right or,
or just just imagine some malicious code

1024
00:50:52,790 --> 00:50:56,460
just destroying the record of,
of uh,

1025
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:58,460
money,
you know,

1026
00:50:58,461 --> 00:51:00,290
just to getting into the banking system,
right?

1027
00:51:00,291 --> 00:51:05,291
So it's like you,
you have men have to go look for the 

1028
00:51:05,291 --> 00:51:07,961
paperwork you may or may not have in 
your desk to argue that you have a 

1029
00:51:07,961 --> 00:51:09,020
certain amount of money because you 
know,

1030
00:51:09,021 --> 00:51:10,700
all those bits got scrambled,
right?

1031
00:51:10,990 --> 00:51:12,680
Um,
and we need some,

1032
00:51:12,830 --> 00:51:15,530
all of this is just this,
there's so many aspects of this,

1033
00:51:15,531 --> 00:51:20,531
but the fact that you can now credibly 
fake audio,

1034
00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:21,170
right?

1035
00:51:21,170 --> 00:51:22,850
So someone can listen to sample,
you know,

1036
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:26,720
five minutes of this podcast and then 
produce a conversation.

1037
00:51:26,721 --> 00:51:30,020
We've never had invoices exactly like 
our own.

1038
00:51:30,470 --> 00:51:33,380
And those edits will no longer be 
discernible.

1039
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:38,400
I mean,
we're basically there now and we're 

1040
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,660
almost there with video,
right where you could just have our 

1041
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:43,121
mouths moving in the correct way.
So I go to snapchat these crazy snapchat

1042
00:51:43,731 --> 00:51:45,290
filters.
I don't know if you know about these,

1043
00:51:45,650 --> 00:51:49,340
but my daughter did pull up the one of 
my daughter being Abraham Lincoln.

1044
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:51,530
I mean,
it's fucking crazy.

1045
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:53,330
I mean it's really rudimentary right 
now,

1046
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:58,360
but my six year old loves it.
She thinks it's hilarious and she 

1047
00:51:58,360 --> 00:51:59,600
constantly uses it all the time.
Like she just like,

1048
00:51:59,601 --> 00:52:04,601
can I pay with your phone?
And she grabs my phone and then she 

1049
00:52:04,601 --> 00:52:04,730
starts doing these little videos like 
somehow or another,

1050
00:52:04,731 --> 00:52:08,660
their little brains like sync up 
immediately with the technology.

1051
00:52:08,670 --> 00:52:10,280
Whereas if I gave it to my mom,
she's be like,

1052
00:52:10,281 --> 00:52:12,770
I don't even know what this is.
What do I do?

1053
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:15,050
That six year old could figure it out 
like that.

1054
00:52:15,290 --> 00:52:15,980
Check this out.

1055
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:26,490
I lost my tooth

1056
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:29,650
if I showed that,
if I showed this to my daughters,

1057
00:52:30,330 --> 00:52:35,160
you just never hear from them again.
It would be the most captivating thing.

1058
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:40,800
I mean,
this is obviously black and white and 

1059
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:40,800
she's being silly and it's really 
obvious.

1060
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:41,440
Obviously it's fake,
but man,

1061
00:52:41,470 --> 00:52:46,470
how far.
I mean this is thing in the world who 

1062
00:52:46,470 --> 00:52:47,440
looks like Abraham linking.
It's mimicking the voice.

1063
00:52:47,590 --> 00:52:49,150
You can't,
like you see her,

1064
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:54,240
her mouth.
You can't discern where her mouth ends 

1065
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:55,240
and Abraham Lincoln's face begins.
But here.

1066
00:52:55,270 --> 00:52:59,170
But what's so insidious about this 
technology I'm talking about now is that

1067
00:52:59,590 --> 00:53:04,590
someone can fake.
I mean it's basically what is already 

1068
00:53:04,590 --> 00:53:04,720
true of Photoshop,
right?

1069
00:53:04,721 --> 00:53:08,080
Where you can't tell.
You have to be an expert to tell whether

1070
00:53:08,081 --> 00:53:13,081
the person was standing next to Donald 
Trump at the time because they could 

1071
00:53:13,081 --> 00:53:16,981
have just been put there,
but with expert and expert use of 

1072
00:53:16,981 --> 00:53:16,981
Photoshop.

1073
00:53:16,981 --> 00:53:20,700
But now we're talking about being able 
to produce content where you are saying 

1074
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:26,250
the thing that completely destroys your 
reputation,

1075
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:29,550
but it's pure.
It's just fake news is just fiction.

1076
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:31,170
And so we need.
I mean,

1077
00:53:31,171 --> 00:53:33,210
I don't know what the fix where this is 
a,

1078
00:53:33,211 --> 00:53:34,620
you know,
I've just Spec,

1079
00:53:34,650 --> 00:53:36,990
and this is again something I know very 
little about,

1080
00:53:36,991 --> 00:53:41,991
but I've clearly something like the 
blockchain has to be a way of anchoring 

1081
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:49,100
each piece of digital content so that 
there's like a chain of custody where 

1082
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:51,240
you see exactly where this came from in 
a way that's not favorable.

1083
00:53:51,630 --> 00:53:53,170
And so if I take,
you know,

1084
00:53:53,190 --> 00:53:58,190
your podcast and example,
if someone is producing a clip that 

1085
00:53:58,190 --> 00:54:01,620
purports to be from your podcast where 
you're saying something insane,

1086
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:07,160
um,
that just has to be a clear fingerprint 

1087
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:11,510
digitally,
which shows whether that came from you 

1088
00:54:11,510 --> 00:54:14,271
and Jamie or whether this came from some
Macedonian hacker who just decided to 

1089
00:54:15,211 --> 00:54:15,600
screw with you.

1090
00:54:16,550 --> 00:54:17,750
Yeah.
Well there's not.

1091
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:18,320
No,
no,

1092
00:54:18,321 --> 00:54:20,060
I know,
but that clearly we need that.

1093
00:54:20,061 --> 00:54:25,061
We need that tomorrow because the 
technology is here to produce totally 

1094
00:54:25,061 --> 00:54:25,940
fake content,
which is.

1095
00:54:26,870 --> 00:54:31,870
I am worried about that.
I'm also worried about the idea that 

1096
00:54:31,870 --> 00:54:33,440
someone anywhere is completely in charge
and knows what's going on.

1097
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:38,560
You know,
I always point to you remember that guy 

1098
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:40,271
that went onstage with Obama and 
pretended to be a sign language 

1099
00:54:40,271 --> 00:54:44,200
translator,
that one that was really that this guy 

1100
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:45,440
was South Africa or something like that.
I believe it was,

1101
00:54:45,441 --> 00:54:47,510
was it?
That sounds right.

1102
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:49,520
But I forget where it was.
Um,

1103
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:49,850
but,
uh,

1104
00:54:49,970 --> 00:54:54,970
but yeah,
I mean that was amazing because it's 

1105
00:54:54,970 --> 00:54:57,491
just so few people read sign language 
that wasn't it around a Mandela.

1106
00:54:59,210 --> 00:55:02,210
I don't know.
I don't remember the details,

1107
00:55:02,211 --> 00:55:07,211
but I remember thinking this fucking guy
is three feet away from the president 

1108
00:55:07,211 --> 00:55:11,350
who was three feet away from the 
president and you would think that they 

1109
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:11,350
had vetted everyone out.

1110
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:15,230
So here's this guy talking and that guy 
is just completely making things up.

1111
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:20,620
He has no idea,
has no idea how to do sign language and 

1112
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:23,220
that,
that,

1113
00:55:23,390 --> 00:55:24,470
you know,
that can happen.

1114
00:55:24,770 --> 00:55:28,100
There was another incidence where a guy 
had gotten in an elevator with Obama,

1115
00:55:28,101 --> 00:55:33,101
a security guard here with a gun,
with a gun loaded gun in an elevator 

1116
00:55:33,101 --> 00:55:33,170
with Obama.
Nobody's screened them.

1117
00:55:33,710 --> 00:55:36,530
It's just people aren't really on the 
ball.

1118
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:41,860
You know,
there was a bit for my last comedy 

1119
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:41,860
special about the uh,
guy that broke into the White House,

1120
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:46,750
but there was a woman guarding the front
door by herself and they had shut the 

1121
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:48,350
alarm off because it kept going off,
so they had a fuck up,

1122
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:53,380
just shut it off.
And then there was a guy who was on the 

1123
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:53,380
lawn who's supposed to be,
he had canines,

1124
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:54,260
supposed to be guarding lawn.

1125
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:57,740
He took his earpiece out to talk to his 
girlfriend on the cell phone.

1126
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:02,960
He had a backup,
a walkie talkie because they have a 

1127
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:02,960
backup one,
but he left that in his locker.

1128
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:07,480
So it was like all these steps and this 
guy just hit the perfect sweet spot 

1129
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:09,260
where you hopped the fence,
ran the whatever,

1130
00:56:09,261 --> 00:56:11,360
100 yards plus to get to the White 
House,

1131
00:56:11,390 --> 00:56:13,670
got to the door.
It was unlocked,

1132
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:19,060
got through it.
There was a girl by herself through her 

1133
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:20,810
to the ground and just ran through the 
White House and was in there for five,

1134
00:56:20,870 --> 00:56:22,460
10 minutes.
He had a knife,

1135
00:56:23,090 --> 00:56:23,980
the knife.
He

1136
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:28,980
was basically trying to.
He was basically a suicide by cop 

1137
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:28,980
situation because they hadn't caught 
him.

1138
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:33,691
This is what's really hilarious when 
people think that the government is 

1139
00:56:33,691 --> 00:56:36,211
watching out for you.
They weren't even watching this guy and 

1140
00:56:36,211 --> 00:56:36,211
listen to what this guy did.
He got arrested.

1141
00:56:36,211 --> 00:56:40,890
They pulled him over,
I believe it was less than three months 

1142
00:56:40,890 --> 00:56:43,930
before that with 800 rounds of 
ammunition.

1143
00:56:43,931 --> 00:56:48,931
He had two rifles,
a shot gun and the ax and a machete and 

1144
00:56:49,330 --> 00:56:54,330
a map of Washington with a fucking x 
where the White House is and they let 

1145
00:56:54,941 --> 00:56:58,470
them go.
They have.

1146
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:02,290
There has to be a crime there,
but they weren't even watching that guy.

1147
00:57:02,690 --> 00:57:07,690
Like the idea that they're watching you,
but we're not built as a species for 

1148
00:57:07,721 --> 00:57:11,110
perfect vigilance.
That's so not perfect.

1149
00:57:11,350 --> 00:57:12,710
I mean,
that's so ridiculous.

1150
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:15,630
Thinking about even the Tsa,
you know,

1151
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:16,770
we,
it's just,

1152
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:21,130
we're just,
we're just not built for that.

1153
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:25,740
Twitter and twitter can confound even 
the perfect vigilance,

1154
00:57:25,741 --> 00:57:27,490
but just look what happened at the 
Oscars.

1155
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:32,140
That was just their only job is to get 
those envelopes right.

1156
00:57:32,470 --> 00:57:37,470
You've got two people with briefcases 
and one guy starts tweeting and produces

1157
00:57:37,570 --> 00:57:39,020
the wrong envelope.
I mean,

1158
00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:40,240
it's just.
Is that what happened?

1159
00:57:40,241 --> 00:57:41,550
He was tweeting.
Yeah,

1160
00:57:41,650 --> 00:57:44,890
he was tweeting.
This is brutal,

1161
00:57:44,891 --> 00:57:49,030
but he took a photo of.
I forget what actress,

1162
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:52,630
but it clearly he was.
I mean they have been deleted the photo,

1163
00:57:52,631 --> 00:57:55,090
but people recovered it.
Yeah,

1164
00:57:55,150 --> 00:58:00,150
he.
He took a shot of somebody I don't 

1165
00:58:00,150 --> 00:58:04,400
charlise their own or somebody who was 
walking backstage and put it on his 

1166
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:08,221
twitter feed and then that.
Then the very next moment was the moment

1167
00:58:08,441 --> 00:58:13,441
when he had to hand over the right 
envelope and he just handed over the 

1168
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:19,020
envelope for the best bankers,
but that's been their only job is to get

1169
00:58:20,111 --> 00:58:25,111
this straight,
just safeguarding the envelopes so it's 

1170
00:58:25,111 --> 00:58:25,360
all adorable.

1171
00:58:25,650 --> 00:58:27,160
Yeah,
there's some.

1172
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:30,840
There's something I really enjoy about 
the folly of people that.

1173
00:58:30,970 --> 00:58:35,970
That's one of the main things that I 
worry about with ai that are the things 

1174
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:40,411
that we find cute about us being 
ridiculous like that or like the sign 

1175
00:58:40,411 --> 00:58:42,440
language guy or any of these things,
but that.

1176
00:58:42,441 --> 00:58:44,520
But that's the thing that computers are 
really good at it.

1177
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:47,620
I mean one is computer to get good at 
this sort of thing,

1178
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:50,300
but we're programming them right now.
But we,

1179
00:58:50,301 --> 00:58:53,440
we can,
we can program them to,

1180
00:58:54,310 --> 00:58:58,900
to fill in the gaps for stupid.
We want.

1181
00:58:58,930 --> 00:59:03,930
What we want to do is automate 
repetitive behavior and error detection 

1182
00:59:04,390 --> 00:59:07,030
that we know we're not good at the 
moment.

1183
00:59:07,031 --> 00:59:10,960
You have a,
a TSA screening robot that,

1184
00:59:11,650 --> 00:59:16,650
that doesn't get distracted.
I mean these machines don't get 

1185
00:59:16,650 --> 00:59:16,650
distracted,
right?

1186
00:59:16,650 --> 00:59:16,650
They don't,
they don't get hungry.

1187
00:59:16,650 --> 00:59:18,070
They don't have to take bathroom breaks,
they don't,

1188
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:23,100
they're not looking at the person who's 
looking at them and get captivated by 

1189
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:23,870
some social glitch.

1190
00:59:23,870 --> 00:59:25,310
Right?
So that it all,

1191
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:30,311
if you have a bomb screening robot,
that's all it will do and it will be 

1192
00:59:30,311 --> 00:59:30,490
better once it,
you know,

1193
00:59:30,580 --> 00:59:33,360
whatever.
Whatever they visual signature or of a,

1194
00:59:33,361 --> 00:59:36,350
of a bomb is when you're talking about 
looking for one in a bag.

1195
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:41,180
Once computers get better at that than 
people they will be.

1196
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:45,470
They will be reliable in a way that 
people can never be.

1197
00:59:45,471 --> 00:59:47,870
And then we know that about ourselves,
so that's we want to,

1198
00:59:47,871 --> 00:59:52,610
we want to outsource all of that stuff 
is driving is the perfect example,

1199
00:59:53,050 --> 00:59:53,550
you know,
you don't,

1200
00:59:53,551 --> 00:59:56,460
you don't have self driving cars that 
are falling asleep or you know,

1201
00:59:56,540 --> 01:00:01,540
will reading billboards and while 
they're driving at 80 miles an hour and 

1202
01:00:01,540 --> 01:00:02,530
um,
and so we want that and,

1203
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:07,640
and,
but the scary scary stuff is when it can

1204
01:00:09,290 --> 01:00:14,290
change itself,
that that's a principle that will allow 

1205
01:00:14,290 --> 01:00:16,400
it to kind of escape from our control or
we just,

1206
01:00:16,401 --> 01:00:19,970
we build something where we haven't 
anticipated the consequences and,

1207
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:22,220
and the incentives are wrong.

1208
01:00:23,580 --> 01:00:28,580
The incentive,
the incentives are not aligned to make 

1209
01:00:28,580 --> 01:00:30,350
us prudent in the development of that 
and what an arms race is.

1210
01:00:30,351 --> 01:00:35,330
The worst case for that because with the
incentives are to get to the end zone as

1211
01:00:35,331 --> 01:00:40,331
quickly as you can because the guy next 
to you is doing the same and you don't 

1212
01:00:41,001 --> 01:00:43,490
know how you don't know whether he's 
ahead of you or behind you.

1213
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:44,180
Right?
And,

1214
01:00:44,490 --> 01:00:49,490
and it's a winner take all scenario 
because the amount of wealth that will 

1215
01:00:49,490 --> 01:00:52,760
go to the winner of this race,
if things work,

1216
01:00:52,761 --> 01:00:54,460
if,
if this person that doesn't know,

1217
01:00:54,461 --> 01:00:57,620
if this group doesn't destroy the world 
is unimaginable.

1218
01:00:57,790 --> 01:00:58,290
I mean,
it's just,

1219
01:00:58,340 --> 01:01:02,580
we're talking about a level of,
of um,

1220
01:01:03,010 --> 01:01:08,010
kind of windfall profits that we just 
haven't seen in any other domain.

1221
01:01:10,190 --> 01:01:15,190
Well,
perfect example is the creation of the 

1222
01:01:15,190 --> 01:01:15,190
atomic bomb.
I mean,

1223
01:01:15,190 --> 01:01:16,160
look at 70 years from the creation of 
the atomic bomb to today,

1224
01:01:16,161 --> 01:01:18,770
which is literally a blip in human 
history.

1225
01:01:18,770 --> 01:01:23,770
Just a tiny little blink of an eye.
And then the United States emerges as 

1226
01:01:23,770 --> 01:01:24,860
the greatest superpower of the world's 
ever known.

1227
01:01:25,370 --> 01:01:30,370
And that's going to be directly 
attributed to those bombs that were 

1228
01:01:30,370 --> 01:01:31,550
dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
Mean that from there on,

1229
01:01:31,910 --> 01:01:34,820
that's where everything takes off.
When you look at human history,

1230
01:01:34,821 --> 01:01:37,100
if you look at us from a thousand years 
from now,

1231
01:01:37,101 --> 01:01:39,800
it's very likely that they look at that 
moment and then they go,

1232
01:01:39,801 --> 01:01:41,900
this is the emergence of the American 
empire.

1233
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:43,710
But this is so much bigger than that 
because.

1234
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:46,760
Because the bombs,
the power and the bomb was just,

1235
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:53,280
just the,
the implicit threat that you might use 

1236
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:53,280
them if you get pissed off.
Right?

1237
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:54,980
But you can't do anything with the bombs
here.

1238
01:01:54,981 --> 01:01:57,980
We're talking about the resource that 
does everything.

1239
01:01:58,040 --> 01:01:59,780
We're talking about intelligence.
We're talking about.

1240
01:01:59,870 --> 01:02:01,280
We're talking about the cure for cancer.

1241
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:06,280
We're talking about the best virtual 
reality entertainment we're talking 

1242
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:07,130
about.
Uh,

1243
01:02:07,820 --> 01:02:09,920
that the,
everything,

1244
01:02:09,950 --> 01:02:12,260
everything that a human being,
once you,

1245
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:16,640
you're talking about general human 
intelligence and beyond,

1246
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:22,120
you're talking about now having access 
to suddenly having access to the 

1247
01:02:22,561 --> 01:02:24,990
smartest people who have ever lived,
who never sleep,

1248
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:29,991
who never get tired,
who never get distracted because now 

1249
01:02:29,991 --> 01:02:31,950
their machines and the smartest people 
who have never lived,

1250
01:02:32,070 --> 01:02:37,070
right?
People who are a thousand times smarter 

1251
01:02:37,070 --> 01:02:37,070
than those people and getting smarter 
every hour,

1252
01:02:37,070 --> 01:02:41,540
right?
And what are they going to do for you 

1253
01:02:41,540 --> 01:02:41,540
when they're your slaves,
right?

1254
01:02:41,540 --> 01:02:44,010
Because now you're talking about because
you don't have to feed these people.

1255
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:49,220
These are working for you.
Just how powerful would you suddenly be 

1256
01:02:49,220 --> 01:02:53,750
if you had 10,000
of the smartest people in the world 

1257
01:02:53,750 --> 01:02:55,920
working for you full time.
They don't have to be fed,

1258
01:02:55,950 --> 01:03:00,950
they never get disgruntled,
they don't need contracts and they just 

1259
01:03:00,950 --> 01:03:03,780
want to do whatever Joe Rogan wants to 
do and get done and you just,

1260
01:03:03,781 --> 01:03:06,960
you flip a switch and that's your 
company,

1261
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:07,440
right?

1262
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:12,980
Um,
that's some version of that going to 

1263
01:03:12,980 --> 01:03:12,980
happen.
The question is,

1264
01:03:12,980 --> 01:03:17,661
is it going to happen in a way that 
where we get this massive dislocation 

1265
01:03:17,661 --> 01:03:22,241
and in wealth inequality where all of a 
sudden someone's got a company and 

1266
01:03:22,241 --> 01:03:26,190
products and a business model which 
obviates,

1267
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:31,240
you know,
30 percent of the American workforce in 

1268
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:35,130
over the span of three months,
or you have some,

1269
01:03:35,310 --> 01:03:37,330
some political and,
and,

1270
01:03:37,420 --> 01:03:42,420
and economic and ethical context in 
which we start sharing the wealth with 

1271
01:03:44,370 --> 01:03:45,130
everyone.
And this,

1272
01:03:45,180 --> 01:03:46,740
this is again,
this is the best case scenario.

1273
01:03:46,741 --> 01:03:50,430
This is when we don't destroy ourselves 
inadvertently by,

1274
01:03:50,490 --> 01:03:52,890
by producing something that's hostile to
our interests.

1275
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:54,000
Daniel terrified.

1276
01:03:54,470 --> 01:03:55,010
Yeah,
no,

1277
01:03:55,011 --> 01:03:56,880
this is.
This is what hanging out with Sam does.

1278
01:03:57,740 --> 01:03:59,430
Just listen.
You spot.

1279
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:04,460
We get to a high spot,
we get a pitcher of Margaritas and we 

1280
01:04:04,460 --> 01:04:04,750
just watched this whole thing.
We're not gonna make it anyway.

1281
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:07,100
None of this room was going to live 
forever when I hang out with Sam,

1282
01:04:07,101 --> 01:04:12,101
usually his wife's there.
So it's like with the conversation is a 

1283
01:04:12,101 --> 01:04:12,101
little less elliptic.
Yeah.

1284
01:04:12,101 --> 01:04:13,820
Yeah.
Well she keeps me grounded.

1285
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:17,390
She is actually awesome because when 
she's there she's like,

1286
01:04:17,450 --> 01:04:20,840
just tooling on him and um,
he giggles and stuff like that.

1287
01:04:20,841 --> 01:04:23,860
It's like a completely different Sam 
than the guy who's under it,

1288
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:26,720
like being an undertaker here and 
telling you about how we're all going to

1289
01:04:26,721 --> 01:04:27,410
die from Ai.

1290
01:04:27,510 --> 01:04:28,070
Yeah.
She's,

1291
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:31,920
she keeps me honest.
But um,

1292
01:04:33,430 --> 01:04:37,210
I mean the truth is it's not.
I mean,

1293
01:04:37,211 --> 01:04:38,380
I'm,
I'm cautiously.

1294
01:04:38,410 --> 01:04:39,360
Whoa.
This is,

1295
01:04:39,670 --> 01:04:40,870
there's no way to stop.
I mean,

1296
01:04:40,871 --> 01:04:42,280
there's no,
there's no brake to pull.

1297
01:04:42,310 --> 01:04:42,940
Right.
So it's like,

1298
01:04:42,941 --> 01:04:46,840
this is the inevitability you were 
describing before.

1299
01:04:47,170 --> 01:04:52,170
We're moving toward this thing because 
intelligence is the best thing in the 

1300
01:04:52,811 --> 01:04:53,530
world.
I mean,

1301
01:04:53,531 --> 01:04:58,531
intelligence is the thing that allows us
to solve every problem we have or don't 

1302
01:04:58,531 --> 01:05:02,941
know we have.
When we discovered what continually 

1303
01:05:02,941 --> 01:05:02,941
discovering new problems and the 
question is,

1304
01:05:02,941 --> 01:05:06,940
what are we going to do?
There's some global pandemic arrives and

1305
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:12,240
the challenges,
do you find a vaccine for this thing or 

1306
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:12,240
not?
Right.

1307
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:14,320
Only intelligence solves that problem 
for us.

1308
01:05:14,321 --> 01:05:19,321
We either,
we either have the data and we can 

1309
01:05:19,321 --> 01:05:19,321
interpret it.
We have to get that.

1310
01:05:19,321 --> 01:05:19,960
We have to design the experiments to get
the data.

1311
01:05:20,570 --> 01:05:22,510
Um,
and it's.

1312
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:23,320
So,
it's,

1313
01:05:24,190 --> 01:05:27,550
there's no question of us deciding while
we've got.

1314
01:05:27,830 --> 01:05:29,890
We're just going to stick with the 
intelligence we've got.

1315
01:05:30,030 --> 01:05:30,580
I mean,
we're just,

1316
01:05:30,850 --> 01:05:32,770
we're not going to do that.
We can't,

1317
01:05:33,020 --> 01:05:34,480
we can,
if there's other people that are working

1318
01:05:34,481 --> 01:05:39,481
on it,
it's exactly right because that's just 

1319
01:05:39,481 --> 01:05:41,401
too much power.
Even if even if we decided that as an 

1320
01:05:41,401 --> 01:05:41,401
American policy,
you know,

1321
01:05:41,401 --> 01:05:46,291
we were not going to let China and North
Korea and Singapore and Iran and Israel 

1322
01:05:46,631 --> 01:05:49,780
and all these other countries do it for 
us,

1323
01:05:50,590 --> 01:05:52,360
so I'm fine,

1324
01:05:52,590 --> 01:05:57,470
but right above denver,
big bucket of Margarita or,

1325
01:05:57,690 --> 01:06:01,100
or,
or the meditation that has helped a,

1326
01:06:02,290 --> 01:06:04,860
that's,
that definitely will help you.

1327
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:07,020
While human beings are a real thing.

1328
01:06:08,270 --> 01:06:10,460
Yes.
Although I wonder if you know,

1329
01:06:10,930 --> 01:06:15,930
the getting enough people meditating 
might improve the quality of whatever 

1330
01:06:16,911 --> 01:06:19,220
gets created in the Ai community.
In other words,

1331
01:06:19,221 --> 01:06:22,790
if you have people who are a little bit 
more sane as a consequence of meditation

1332
01:06:22,791 --> 01:06:26,020
than maybe a,
the people designing these products that

1333
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:27,970
the rather these,
uh,

1334
01:06:28,470 --> 01:06:33,470
don't know if products the right word,
this stuff that somehow this stuff is 

1335
01:06:33,470 --> 01:06:33,470
better.

1336
01:06:33,470 --> 01:06:36,200
Well,
I think it's especially relevant for the

1337
01:06:36,201 --> 01:06:40,160
other side of that which is when you 
mean in the near term,

1338
01:06:40,190 --> 01:06:42,770
we clearly have a,
an employment problem.

1339
01:06:42,860 --> 01:06:47,860
I mean there,
there are jobs that will go away that 

1340
01:06:47,860 --> 01:06:51,461
are not coming back and this is a 
perennial problem where people need to 

1341
01:06:51,461 --> 01:06:53,410
find meaning in life.
But,

1342
01:06:53,530 --> 01:06:58,530
but we've always had,
it hasn't been such a pressing problem 

1343
01:06:58,530 --> 01:07:02,141
for thousands of years because there's 
always been so much to do just to 

1344
01:07:02,141 --> 01:07:03,500
survive.
Right now what we're.

1345
01:07:03,890 --> 01:07:08,890
In the ideal case,
we'll get to a place where there's 

1346
01:07:08,890 --> 01:07:13,150
actually much less that has to be done 
because we have machines that do it and 

1347
01:07:13,150 --> 01:07:17,981
we have to.
We have seen the wisdom of mitigating 

1348
01:07:17,981 --> 01:07:19,980
wealth inequality to some extent

1349
01:07:20,050 --> 01:07:21,880
bilevel were so every,
so all,

1350
01:07:21,881 --> 01:07:22,570
all boats

1351
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:25,090
begin to rise with this tied to some 
degree,

1352
01:07:25,590 --> 01:07:30,590
uh,
so whether it's universal basic income 

1353
01:07:30,590 --> 01:07:32,491
or some.
So we have some mechanism to spread the 

1354
01:07:32,491 --> 01:07:32,491
wealth around.
But then there's the

1355
01:07:32,491 --> 01:07:33,090
question of what do you do with your 
life?

1356
01:07:33,690 --> 01:07:35,550
So what do you think people will do 
that,

1357
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:40,880
that's the easiest one is not,
but it's not so easy because people 

1358
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:40,880
will.
People are confused.

1359
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:42,660
People in St Louis need to get their 
shit together.

1360
01:07:42,690 --> 01:07:45,000
I mean that,
that's giving someone free time,

1361
01:07:45,001 --> 01:07:48,210
but find a hobby man.
I mean there's a lot of stuff to do.

1362
01:07:48,211 --> 01:07:50,280
If you told me that I never had to work 
again,

1363
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:55,400
that we just have to find things to do 
all day and all my food and everything 

1364
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:58,971
would be taken care of.
That would be the easiest choice I've 

1365
01:07:58,971 --> 01:07:59,250
ever made in my life.
I would just pursue things.

1366
01:07:59,251 --> 01:08:00,960
I would just learn how to speak a 
language.

1367
01:08:00,961 --> 01:08:04,530
I've learned how to play an instrument.
I'd practice archery more.

1368
01:08:04,531 --> 01:08:06,960
I do Jujitsu more.
I don't.

1369
01:08:07,410 --> 01:08:08,820
That seems to me,
so riddick,

1370
01:08:08,850 --> 01:08:12,120
that seems to me that can be solved 
really easy was a guy,

1371
01:08:12,470 --> 01:08:12,680
but

1372
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:17,680
I think that the.
I'm not convinced I feel that I could 

1373
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:21,461
fill endless swaths of of free time with
a number of things that I'm interested 

1374
01:08:21,461 --> 01:08:26,051
in including but not limited to 
meditation or just hanging out with my 

1375
01:08:26,051 --> 01:08:26,720
two year old.
However,

1376
01:08:26,721 --> 01:08:31,721
I'm not sure that the vast majority of 
humans are like that

1377
01:08:32,450 --> 01:08:37,450
guidance.
That seems to be the be the easiest 

1378
01:08:37,450 --> 01:08:37,450
thing to solve that.
Just let them know it.

1379
01:08:37,450 --> 01:08:39,560
Go find something fun to do.
Can start running up hills,

1380
01:08:39,561 --> 01:08:40,740
man,
go up,

1381
01:08:40,910 --> 01:08:45,230
take up Frisbee Golf.
Just to shift to do.

1382
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:50,480
There's a lot of shit to do.
My concern is that more and more it 

1383
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:53,771
will.
It will take the form of being merely 

1384
01:08:53,771 --> 01:08:55,100
entertained,
so we'll plug into some vr.

1385
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:58,370
Last scene of wally.
I never saw that movie.

1386
01:08:58,380 --> 01:09:00,040
Well,
okay guys,

1387
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:02,450
you should maybe pull it,
pull this up,

1388
01:09:02,451 --> 01:09:04,550
but the.
They're in wally.

1389
01:09:04,610 --> 01:09:09,610
That's a dystopian future where 
everybody's riding around in those 

1390
01:09:09,610 --> 01:09:12,880
little jazzy.
I'm a mobile wheelchairs that people 

1391
01:09:14,331 --> 01:09:19,331
sit,
sit in Disneyland and they are also 

1392
01:09:19,331 --> 01:09:22,660
there.
They've got huge buckets of soda and 

1393
01:09:22,660 --> 01:09:25,020
like Turkey legs and and draped like 
kind of hooked over the back of the,

1394
01:09:25,610 --> 01:09:28,760
of their motorized vehicle as a monitor 
at the front,

1395
01:09:28,761 --> 01:09:33,761
which is entertaining them.
It was just obese and entertained and 

1396
01:09:33,761 --> 01:09:35,540
immobile or mobile,
but not actually ambulatory

1397
01:09:35,620 --> 01:09:37,340
is Disneyland.
What were.

1398
01:09:37,540 --> 01:09:42,540
What's happened in our lifetime that the
smartphone has made it virtually 

1399
01:09:43,601 --> 01:09:47,350
impossible to be bored.
Boredom used to be a thing like you'd.

1400
01:09:47,380 --> 01:09:50,620
You'd be sitting in the waiting room of 
a doctor,

1401
01:09:50,621 --> 01:09:55,621
right?
And they have crappy magazines and then 

1402
01:09:55,621 --> 01:09:55,621
you're just sitting there.
So at the end,

1403
01:09:55,621 --> 01:10:00,061
if you didn't know how to meditate,
you had to confront this sense of on 

1404
01:10:00,270 --> 01:10:02,930
board right now,
a while you just go.

1405
01:10:02,931 --> 01:10:07,931
One thing you discovered when he learned
how to meditate is boredom is just an 

1406
01:10:07,931 --> 01:10:10,270
inability to pay attention to anything 
and you can pay attention.

1407
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:12,160
Once you learn to pay attention to 
anything,

1408
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:14,530
even something as seemingly boring as 
your breath,

1409
01:10:14,980 --> 01:10:16,630
it suddenly becomes incredibly 
interesting.

1410
01:10:16,631 --> 01:10:21,631
So,
so focused attention is intrinsically 

1411
01:10:21,631 --> 01:10:22,750
pleasurable,
but boredom is the state of,

1412
01:10:22,810 --> 01:10:27,810
of kind of scattered attention looking 
for something that's worth paying 

1413
01:10:27,810 --> 01:10:30,190
attention to.
And yet now with technology,

1414
01:10:30,820 --> 01:10:32,470
you're never going to be bored again.
And I've got,

1415
01:10:32,690 --> 01:10:36,040
I have at least 10 years worth of 
reading on my phone,

1416
01:10:36,430 --> 01:10:38,450
right?
So it's like if I'm standing in live,

1417
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:41,370
I,
I'm constantly pulling this thing out as

1418
01:10:41,390 --> 01:10:43,180
a bad thing.
Well,

1419
01:10:43,181 --> 01:10:46,480
it's,
it's potentially a bad thing because you

1420
01:10:46,860 --> 01:10:51,860
for images to take this example of,
of one interesting insight you get when 

1421
01:10:51,860 --> 01:10:52,060
you learn to meditate.

1422
01:10:54,650 --> 01:10:59,200
It's incredibly powerful to cut through 
the illusion of boredom.

1423
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:01,200
I mean,
to realize that boredom is,

1424
01:11:01,310 --> 01:11:06,310
is not,
is not something you can become 

1425
01:11:06,310 --> 01:11:09,690
interested in the feeling of boredom and
the moment you do it bites its own tail 

1426
01:11:10,541 --> 01:11:11,880
and disappeared.
I mean it's just like a,

1427
01:11:11,910 --> 01:11:15,210
it's there no such thing as boredom when
you're paying close attention

1428
01:11:15,260 --> 01:11:20,260
to your experience.
I think the bad thing about the hyper 

1429
01:11:20,260 --> 01:11:20,620
stimulation that we get through our 
phone and,

1430
01:11:20,670 --> 01:11:25,670
and all of technology is that we have 
lost the ability to just sit back and,

1431
01:11:28,250 --> 01:11:30,730
uh,
for lack of a less cliched term,

1432
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:35,760
B and w we're just constantly stimulated
and that means we have trouble paying 

1433
01:11:37,151 --> 01:11:42,070
attention when we're holding our kid in 
our lap and reading him or her a book or

1434
01:11:42,071 --> 01:11:44,380
we find ourselves without our technology
for a moment.

1435
01:11:44,381 --> 01:11:47,210
There was a recent study that asked 
people a,

1436
01:11:47,290 --> 01:11:52,290
would you rather be alone with your 
thoughts or get electric shocks and a 

1437
01:11:52,290 --> 01:11:57,061
lot of people took the electric shocks 
and I actually think that is a 

1438
01:11:57,061 --> 01:11:57,440
fundamental problem,
uh,

1439
01:11:57,650 --> 01:12:02,650
in terms of not being able to get in 
touch with the Ra and kind of powerful,

1440
01:12:03,011 --> 01:12:06,730
although obvious fact that you're alive 
and that you exist.

1441
01:12:06,790 --> 01:12:07,300
Right?
But

1442
01:12:07,910 --> 01:12:09,680
don't you think those people are idiots?
I mean,

1443
01:12:09,681 --> 01:12:11,120
you don't want electric shock.
You don't want.

1444
01:12:11,121 --> 01:12:16,121
I won't take an electric shock.
You're not going to take an electric 

1445
01:12:16,121 --> 01:12:18,281
shock.
We were talking about the dude with the 

1446
01:12:18,281 --> 01:12:19,190
snapchat.
Jamie is on the ball.

1447
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:21,380
I don't want those glasses either,
but you know what I'm saying.

1448
01:12:21,381 --> 01:12:26,381
He doesn't use the glasses.
He just explores it because it's 

1449
01:12:26,381 --> 01:12:26,381
fascinating.
But you know what I'm talking about.

1450
01:12:26,381 --> 01:12:28,130
I mean,
we're not talking about rational people.

1451
01:12:28,131 --> 01:12:29,750
We're talking about lowest common 
denominator.

1452
01:12:29,751 --> 01:12:31,210
People that would take an electric 
shock,

1453
01:12:31,890 --> 01:12:32,870
you would take an electric shock

1454
01:12:34,460 --> 01:12:36,980
study of they're not just picking idiot

1455
01:12:37,630 --> 01:12:40,060
are they asking and what?
How are they phrasing the question,

1456
01:12:40,090 --> 01:12:40,780
but it also doesn't.
I have

1457
01:12:40,780 --> 01:12:42,070
to be conscious.
So for instance,

1458
01:12:42,130 --> 01:12:47,130
we,
we willingly grant our attention to 

1459
01:12:47,130 --> 01:12:50,461
things which retrospectively we can 
judge produce more or less nothing but 

1460
01:12:52,901 --> 01:12:54,160
pain for us.
So I was like,

1461
01:12:54,430 --> 01:12:59,430
well,
I mean I'm continually thinking about 

1462
01:12:59,430 --> 01:13:00,580
this and rethinking about this with 
respect to social media.

1463
01:13:00,610 --> 01:13:05,610
Like I.
So when I like what comes to 

1464
01:13:05,610 --> 01:13:08,040
[inaudible],
what's the effect on my mind of looking 

1465
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:10,711
at my twitter at mentioned?
So I wondered that when you were asking 

1466
01:13:10,711 --> 01:13:10,750
people what kind of questions they said,
yeah,

1467
01:13:10,780 --> 01:13:14,410
we should ask what some of this podcast.
Sometimes it's incredibly useful.

1468
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:19,480
I was thinking of what you're doing.
You're opening yourself up to the green 

1469
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:23,110
frog,
but I've had both kinds of experience.

1470
01:13:23,111 --> 01:13:28,111
I've had people send me articles that I 
would have never found otherwise and 

1471
01:13:28,111 --> 01:13:29,210
fascinating,
super useful and it's just,

1472
01:13:29,410 --> 01:13:32,590
it's like this is the perfect use of 
this technology and then again,

1473
01:13:32,591 --> 01:13:34,860
then I,
then I get this river of green frogs and

1474
01:13:34,900 --> 01:13:37,730
weirdness,
but the.

1475
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:43,100
But the to the previous point,
I pay attention to something for long 

1476
01:13:45,071 --> 01:13:50,071
stretches of time rather than do in 
something I know is good for me with my 

1477
01:13:50,071 --> 01:13:52,530
attention.
I kind of spin the roulette wheel with,

1478
01:13:52,590 --> 01:13:57,590
with twitter and rather often there's 
just this kind of toxic undercurrent of,

1479
01:14:01,710 --> 01:14:06,710
of mental activity that it produces in 
me that I'm mean.

1480
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:08,710
It doesn't make me feel.
I mean,

1481
01:14:08,711 --> 01:14:11,440
it doesn't equip me to do anything 
better in life.

1482
01:14:11,620 --> 01:14:14,590
It doesn't make me feel any better about
myself or other people.

1483
01:14:14,591 --> 01:14:14,940
I mean,
if,

1484
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,490
if it has any net effect,
it's.

1485
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:22,600
It basically grabbed a dozen dials that 
I can just sort of dimly conceive of in 

1486
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:25,540
my mind and turn them all a little bit 
toward the negative.

1487
01:14:25,690 --> 01:14:27,580
You know,
I feel a little bit worse about myself,

1488
01:14:27,581 --> 01:14:32,581
a little bit worse about my career,
a little bit worse about people will go 

1489
01:14:32,581 --> 01:14:34,390
a little bit worse about the future,
a little bit worse about the fact that I

1490
01:14:34,820 --> 01:14:39,820
was doing this when I could have been 
playing with my kid or or writing or 

1491
01:14:39,820 --> 01:14:42,630
thinking productive thoughts or 
meditating or doing anything that I know

1492
01:14:42,631 --> 01:14:47,140
is that you still do this twitter 
compulsion,

1493
01:14:48,090 --> 01:14:49,510
you argue with people.

1494
01:14:49,700 --> 01:14:50,940
I found that fascinating.
You.

1495
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:55,180
I go,
I go for.

1496
01:14:55,181 --> 01:14:56,770
I go for weeks without arguments as 
well,

1497
01:14:56,771 --> 01:14:58,960
but also you argue with people on your 
podcast.

1498
01:14:59,440 --> 01:14:59,830
Well,
yeah,

1499
01:14:59,860 --> 01:15:01,210
but that's,
that's different.

1500
01:15:01,470 --> 01:15:06,470
But I mean it.
Just on the podcast you'll also be 

1501
01:15:06,470 --> 01:15:06,470
talking about people you're arguing with
on twitter or a.

1502
01:15:06,550 --> 01:15:10,180
So the arguing is a part of your.
Well,

1503
01:15:10,210 --> 01:15:13,540
I get trolled a lot on twitter.
I get trolled.

1504
01:15:14,140 --> 01:15:17,140
You have guests,
you have guests who come on your podcast

1505
01:15:17,470 --> 01:15:22,150
and savage me on the podcast and then 
troll me endlessly on twitter and abby.

1506
01:15:22,270 --> 01:15:23,710
Abby Martin.
Well she was.

1507
01:15:23,711 --> 01:15:24,310
No,
she doesn't try.

1508
01:15:24,330 --> 01:15:24,650
I mean,
she,

1509
01:15:24,750 --> 01:15:25,240
she,
she,

1510
01:15:25,430 --> 01:15:26,260
she,
she hates me,

1511
01:15:26,261 --> 01:15:27,460
but she,
I don't know.

1512
01:15:27,670 --> 01:15:29,050
I haven't noticed her at trolling me,
but no,

1513
01:15:29,051 --> 01:15:32,080
you got in a room with her.
Everybody would calm down.

1514
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:37,200
She just has.
There's people that have radical 

1515
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:37,200
misconceptions of who you are.

1516
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:37,200
You.
Yeah.

1517
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:41,340
I'm sure you heard the josh steps a 
patent Oswald thing or Patton Oswalt 

1518
01:15:41,340 --> 01:15:45,630
don't,
don't listen to it because he went off 

1519
01:15:45,630 --> 01:15:45,880
the rails pack,
went off the rails,

1520
01:15:46,260 --> 01:15:50,350
like Hannibal style.
When are you thinking of Andy Kindler?

1521
01:15:50,410 --> 01:15:51,510
Oh yes.
I'm sorry.

1522
01:15:52,540 --> 01:15:53,620
I'm so sorry.
That's good.

1523
01:15:53,980 --> 01:15:56,700
So sorry.
How do I connect patents?

1524
01:15:56,710 --> 01:15:58,090
Great.
Good patents.

1525
01:15:58,150 --> 01:16:00,910
Very smart and very reasonable as is 
andy for the most,

1526
01:16:01,180 --> 01:16:02,380
most of the time.
But so,

1527
01:16:02,460 --> 01:16:05,200
so the end is kind of discovered this 
very late.

1528
01:16:05,230 --> 01:16:07,460
I did it.
So I kept seeing this guy.

1529
01:16:07,461 --> 01:16:09,730
I didn't know who he was.
I kept seeing him in my twitter feed,

1530
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:11,620
Andy Kindler and they can learn and then
I realized,

1531
01:16:11,621 --> 01:16:13,540
wait a minute.
He is actually,

1532
01:16:13,570 --> 01:16:15,970
he seems to be mean.
He's an established comic.

1533
01:16:15,971 --> 01:16:20,730
He seems to be friends with people who I
really respect who I don't know.

1534
01:16:20,731 --> 01:16:21,240
Like,
you know,

1535
01:16:21,250 --> 01:16:23,890
like Sarah Silverman,
who I don't know personally,

1536
01:16:23,891 --> 01:16:28,891
I mean we've,
we've communicated a little bit on 

1537
01:16:28,891 --> 01:16:28,891
twitter,
but it's like I,

1538
01:16:28,891 --> 01:16:32,710
I,
I'm just nothing but a pure fan of 

1539
01:16:32,710 --> 01:16:32,710
Sarah,
Jim Gaffigan,

1540
01:16:32,710 --> 01:16:34,300
other big comics,
so I totally respect.

1541
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:36,520
I don't know how close he is with these 
people,

1542
01:16:36,580 --> 01:16:41,580
but he basically,
he has endless energy for vilifying me 

1543
01:16:41,580 --> 01:16:42,370
as a racist and a bigot.
Right.

1544
01:16:42,371 --> 01:16:43,810
I mean he's just,
he's a madman.

1545
01:16:44,350 --> 01:16:49,350
And I discovered so I did a search of 
his twitter feed and he's got hundreds 

1546
01:16:49,350 --> 01:16:54,120
and hundreds of tweets where he's,
he's going after me in the most retail 

1547
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:54,120
way.
So for instance,

1548
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:54,730
like I,
I,

1549
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:59,880
I tweeted out a can anyone recommend 500
seat halls and all these cities and I 

1550
01:17:00,431 --> 01:17:02,410
think your friend is Duncan Trussell,
a friend of yours.

1551
01:17:02,411 --> 01:17:04,030
Okay.
So Duncan wrote back saying,

1552
01:17:04,150 --> 01:17:05,160
Oh yeah,
Dma,

1553
01:17:05,170 --> 01:17:07,150
I've got a great place in Boston or 
something.

1554
01:17:07,450 --> 01:17:12,450
And then Andy kindler jumped into that 
thread talking to Duncan saying,

1555
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:13,810
don't help him,
Duncan,

1556
01:17:13,820 --> 01:17:15,140
he's a bigot.
Right?

1557
01:17:15,230 --> 01:17:20,230
So like he's like,
this is Andy kindler just got endless 

1558
01:17:20,230 --> 01:17:20,230
energy for this.
And then I,

1559
01:17:20,230 --> 01:17:23,921
then I looked at what he was doing and 
he had been doing it for years and I 

1560
01:17:23,921 --> 01:17:26,360
wasn't aware of it just to you just to 
me and Bill Maher,

1561
01:17:26,361 --> 01:17:31,361
he hates Bill Maher,
but then you've got another guy on this 

1562
01:17:31,361 --> 01:17:31,361
podcast.

1563
01:17:31,361 --> 01:17:34,600
I'm hunter mats once.
Okay.

1564
01:17:34,770 --> 01:17:39,770
So he was on here and I actually had to 
go back and watch what he said here 

1565
01:17:39,770 --> 01:17:43,211
because I had been getting so much of 
this on twitter and I mean it's 

1566
01:17:43,211 --> 01:17:43,400
incredibly common.
People are tweeting at me saying,

1567
01:17:43,700 --> 01:17:46,540
why won't you debate hunter is,
is Matt?

1568
01:17:46,830 --> 01:17:48,610
Okay,
why won't you debate hunter mass?

1569
01:17:48,630 --> 01:17:50,030
I went back and looked at what he said 
here,

1570
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:55,560
you know,
half of it frankly didn't make any 

1571
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:55,560
sense.
Um,

1572
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:59,170
but his attacks on me on twitter are the
most juvenile.

1573
01:17:59,241 --> 01:18:04,241
It's like the idea that he thinks this 
is a way he's going to establish a 

1574
01:18:04,241 --> 01:18:06,980
conversation with me by sending me to 
tweets and then sending me 400,

1575
01:18:07,020 --> 01:18:10,190
which say you're scared to debate me.
Right?

1576
01:18:10,540 --> 01:18:11,500
Um,
it's,

1577
01:18:11,780 --> 01:18:14,860
I mean,
I don't know,

1578
01:18:14,870 --> 01:18:15,860
maybe it's very,
very,

1579
01:18:15,861 --> 01:18:20,861
very smart guy,
but taking a terrible socially retarded 

1580
01:18:20,861 --> 01:18:21,950
approach to establishing a debate.

1581
01:18:21,950 --> 01:18:26,950
And I've contacted Brian Cowen about 
this and Brian Cowen contacted hunter 

1582
01:18:26,950 --> 01:18:27,050
about this.
It's like,

1583
01:18:27,051 --> 01:18:29,840
what the fuck are you doing?
And he continues to do crazy behavior.

1584
01:18:29,870 --> 01:18:32,190
He said he wouldn't do it anymore and 
then he gives more.

1585
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:33,770
I mean,
every time I look,

1586
01:18:33,771 --> 01:18:35,930
I,
I see him somewhere in there,

1587
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:38,180
but then there's this guy,
Mike Cernovich,

1588
01:18:38,181 --> 01:18:43,181
who,
who's actually has effects on the real 

1589
01:18:43,181 --> 01:18:43,181
world.
I mean,

1590
01:18:43,181 --> 01:18:45,650
Mike Cernovich is again,
he's a twitter troll.

1591
01:18:46,100 --> 01:18:47,060
Um,
again,

1592
01:18:47,061 --> 01:18:49,880
one of these other guys who's challenged
me to debate him and uh,

1593
01:18:49,881 --> 01:18:50,770
you know,
I mean there's,

1594
01:18:50,771 --> 01:18:51,320
there's,
there's no,

1595
01:18:51,350 --> 01:18:53,730
there's absolutely no possibility to 
suitable dialogue,

1596
01:18:53,750 --> 01:18:57,770
spend less time on twitter,
but Cernovich's was just on 60 minutes.

1597
01:18:57,771 --> 01:18:58,310
I mean,
he's like,

1598
01:18:58,340 --> 01:19:02,300
he's in the world and he's affecting 
people's psyche.

1599
01:19:03,050 --> 01:19:03,740
Oh yeah.
Well,

1600
01:19:04,130 --> 01:19:04,940
for sure.
Right.

1601
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:07,160
Yeah.
So they can come back.

1602
01:19:07,220 --> 01:19:07,920
It's,
it's not,

1603
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:12,950
it's not the nine times out of 10 
looking just makes me think,

1604
01:19:13,700 --> 01:19:18,700
um,
I mean it's an illusion because if you 

1605
01:19:18,700 --> 01:19:20,531
met most of these people with you,
if they came up to you at a conference 

1606
01:19:20,531 --> 01:19:20,531
or at a book signing or so,
you know,

1607
01:19:20,810 --> 01:19:25,040
after a Gig of yours and you thought you
had more information about them,

1608
01:19:25,041 --> 01:19:27,530
you saw all of the,
you know,

1609
01:19:28,420 --> 01:19:30,620
all of the crazy coming out,
um,

1610
01:19:30,710 --> 01:19:33,570
you would say,
I don't have to pay any time.

1611
01:19:33,650 --> 01:19:36,230
There's no reason to pay attention to 
what this guy is saying.

1612
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:38,690
Whereas on twitter,
everything is,

1613
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:43,760
has the same stature.
So whether it's a Washington Post 

1614
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:46,781
columnist who's tweeting at me or some,
some guy like hunter who I had no idea 

1615
01:19:47,511 --> 01:19:52,511
who he is,
but he's telling me I've got something 

1616
01:19:52,511 --> 01:19:52,511
wrong.
Um,

1617
01:19:52,511 --> 01:19:53,570
everything has the same stature and you 
just,

1618
01:19:53,571 --> 01:19:55,920
there's no signal to noise sense of what
you know.

1619
01:19:55,950 --> 01:19:56,690
Well,
first of all,

1620
01:19:56,691 --> 01:19:59,300
you fucked up because you talked about 
them,

1621
01:20:00,140 --> 01:20:05,140
both of them.
You said candy man five times and now 

1622
01:20:05,140 --> 01:20:07,751
you've got a problem.
You talked about him right now on this 

1623
01:20:07,751 --> 01:20:10,301
project,
and this is the first time I've ever 

1624
01:20:10,301 --> 01:20:11,831
mentioned the gun out,
but I'll go in and talk to you before 

1625
01:20:11,831 --> 01:20:11,831
this.
I'm bringing it to you because you you,

1626
01:20:11,831 --> 01:20:12,700
but you created it.
I mean it was,

1627
01:20:13,070 --> 01:20:14,340
it was,
it was his.

1628
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:16,900
It was his podcast with you.
They kicked this whole thing on.

1629
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:22,840
100 was going to do that and I know for 
a fact that hunter is actually a fan of 

1630
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:25,701
yours.
I think when hunter is trying got a 

1631
01:20:25,701 --> 01:20:25,701
strange way of showing it.
I don't think it's a smart way.

1632
01:20:25,701 --> 01:20:27,330
I think what he's trying to do and he,
he,

1633
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:32,500
when I was trying to hold his feet to 
the fire and get some sort of a logical 

1634
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:36,860
definition of what you do wrong,
he really didn't have anything we'll hit

1635
01:20:37,170 --> 01:20:39,330
but he thinks he does and he.
But did he,

1636
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:44,360
when I talked to them about it and send 
half of what he said about Dawkins and 

1637
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:48,801
me,
it was totally wrong of what he said 

1638
01:20:48,801 --> 01:20:48,801
about the relevant biology was wrong.
I mean he's just,

1639
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:52,020
he's not.
He doesn't have his shit together,

1640
01:20:52,500 --> 01:20:56,520
but he thinks he does and there's this,
there's a,

1641
01:20:57,270 --> 01:21:02,270
there's a level of arrogance and,
and in civility and just kind of a lack 

1642
01:21:04,771 --> 01:21:09,771
of charity in,
in interacting with other people's 

1643
01:21:09,771 --> 01:21:13,130
views,
which is now kind of getting rebranded 

1644
01:21:13,130 --> 01:21:16,950
on the Internet as just just American 
can do Chutzpah.

1645
01:21:16,980 --> 01:21:17,630
Right?
And it's like,

1646
01:21:17,631 --> 01:21:18,810
it's,
it's given us trump,

1647
01:21:18,811 --> 01:21:23,811
right?
It's like you've got a trump as the 

1648
01:21:23,811 --> 01:21:23,811
ultimate example.
He's like the cartoon version of,

1649
01:21:23,811 --> 01:21:27,980
you know,
a person who doesn't know anything 

1650
01:21:27,980 --> 01:21:30,741
relevant to the enterprise,
who doesn't show any aptitude for 

1651
01:21:32,490 --> 01:21:36,210
civilly engaging with differences of 
opinion.

1652
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:42,320
And this thing gets amplified to the,
to the place of greatest prominence.

1653
01:21:42,541 --> 01:21:47,541
Now in human history,
everyone's on social media or many 

1654
01:21:47,541 --> 01:21:48,600
people on social media are playing the 
same game.

1655
01:21:49,050 --> 01:21:51,060
And you know,
Ms Dot Cernovich is another,

1656
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:54,330
you know,
just malignant example of this where you

1657
01:21:54,331 --> 01:21:57,360
have someone who's got a fairly large 
following.

1658
01:21:57,361 --> 01:21:58,770
I mean,
it's not as big as yours,

1659
01:21:58,771 --> 01:21:59,400
but it's,
you know,

1660
01:21:59,401 --> 01:22:02,160
it's,
it's a very engaged following.

1661
01:22:02,550 --> 01:22:04,530
This whole trump phenomenon has,
has,

1662
01:22:05,010 --> 01:22:05,540
has,
uh,

1663
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:08,190
shown me that Pete,
that if a small percentage of,

1664
01:22:08,191 --> 01:22:13,191
of one's audience can have like 100 
times the energy of the rest of your 

1665
01:22:14,011 --> 01:22:16,080
audience,
like whenever I went against trump on my

1666
01:22:16,081 --> 01:22:20,580
podcast or this is still the case,
the level of,

1667
01:22:20,581 --> 01:22:25,581
of pain it causes in,
in the sort of feedback space is 

1668
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:28,830
completely out of proportion to the 
numbers of people who are,

1669
01:22:29,010 --> 01:22:31,680
who are on that side of the argument.

1670
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:33,480
And it's so.
It's incredibly energized,

1671
01:22:33,481 --> 01:22:38,481
but it's just this weird style of self 
promotion where you'd.

1672
01:22:38,790 --> 01:22:40,710
All you do is that you brag about 
yourself,

1673
01:22:40,711 --> 01:22:42,080
you say you're the best,
you're,

1674
01:22:42,490 --> 01:22:43,080
you're,
you're,

1675
01:22:43,140 --> 01:22:48,140
you're someone who has absolutely no 
basis to back up those claims.

1676
01:22:48,361 --> 01:22:53,361
And yet an audience thrills to that 
level of arrogance and an empty boast.

1677
01:22:54,700 --> 01:22:57,540
It's just bizarre.
But well there's a,

1678
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:02,600
there's a big issue I think online where
people find likeminded people and then 

1679
01:23:03,481 --> 01:23:06,130
they develop these communities where 
they

1680
01:23:06,130 --> 01:23:09,040
just support each other and they,
they just have these,

1681
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:11,770
these gigantic groups of people.
I mean,

1682
01:23:11,771 --> 01:23:16,771
not even necessarily gigantic,
but groups of people that find any 

1683
01:23:16,771 --> 01:23:17,920
subject,
like for me,

1684
01:23:17,980 --> 01:23:20,550
you know what it is flat earth,
right?

1685
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:26,040
I get trolled by people all day that 
claim I'm a sellout because I don't 

1686
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:27,850
believe the earth is flat,
Mrs Reel.

1687
01:23:28,070 --> 01:23:29,340
But,
but don't think that there's a,

1688
01:23:29,380 --> 01:23:30,100
there's a,

1689
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:33,990
I think this phenomenon that you're 
describing is both,

1690
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:39,720
um,
has really serious negative 

1691
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:39,720
consequences.
But it also has some beauty on the same.

1692
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:41,730
By the same token,
you've got parents,

1693
01:23:42,180 --> 01:23:47,180
uh,
all over the world who've got children 

1694
01:23:47,180 --> 01:23:47,850
with a rare disease,
but they can connect on the internet and

1695
01:23:47,851 --> 01:23:51,190
bond over that and share tips and Dr.
sure.

1696
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:52,560
So it is,
it's actually,

1697
01:23:52,561 --> 01:23:55,410
they're both outgrowths of the same kind
of phenomenon,

1698
01:23:55,411 --> 01:23:57,810
but he can be a,
we see the,

1699
01:23:58,260 --> 01:24:00,450
the really difficult,
uh,

1700
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:05,480
uh,
consequences of this in our politics 

1701
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:05,480
right now,
et Cetera,

1702
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:05,480
et cetera.

1703
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:06,200
I think we're talking about two 
different things.

1704
01:24:06,201 --> 01:24:07,940
You think.
So I'm talking about confirmation bias.

1705
01:24:07,941 --> 01:24:09,830
I'm talking about a bunch of people that
get together and say,

1706
01:24:09,831 --> 01:24:14,831
yeah,
obviously I'm woke in the earth is flat 

1707
01:24:14,831 --> 01:24:16,070
and pay attention.
There's an analogy allows ball,

1708
01:24:16,220 --> 01:24:18,440
yes it,
but there are different things.

1709
01:24:18,770 --> 01:24:23,770
The groups of people that will find 
communities where maybe your child has 

1710
01:24:23,770 --> 01:24:27,581
autism and there's some sort of an issue
that can be mitigated with diet and 

1711
01:24:27,581 --> 01:24:31,990
parents have had some success with that 
and they could give you some 

1712
01:24:31,990 --> 01:24:35,891
enlightening information and you can 
communicate with each other and that's 

1713
01:24:35,891 --> 01:24:39,071
nice.
It's beautiful and I'm some of the 

1714
01:24:39,071 --> 01:24:39,350
hashtags that people use that they find 
search through.

1715
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:44,560
It's great,
but you know that these little 

1716
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:46,670
communities that you bond,
that they're not those those ideas.

1717
01:24:47,230 --> 01:24:49,400
There's no confirmation bias in those 
ideas,

1718
01:24:49,401 --> 01:24:54,401
but there's confirmation bias and the 
idea that trump is the man is 

1719
01:24:54,401 --> 01:24:54,860
confirmation bias and the idea that the 
earth is flat.

1720
01:24:55,120 --> 01:25:00,120
You know,
and if you just huddle in those little 

1721
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:00,680
communities and just bark the same 
noises that everybody else barks,

1722
01:25:01,100 --> 01:25:03,390
there's some sort of sense of community 
in that too.

1723
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:09,080
And people love that.
They love being a part of a fucking 

1724
01:25:09,080 --> 01:25:09,770
team.
Even if it's a stupid team of green frog

1725
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:14,840
and you don't have it.
You don't have to listen to other 

1726
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:15,600
people's views and you get deeply,
deeply entrenched.

1727
01:25:15,601 --> 01:25:20,601
I think we're seeing.
We're seeing this all through our 

1728
01:25:20,601 --> 01:25:20,601
politics and media right now.

1729
01:25:20,601 --> 01:25:25,110
Well,
you also see when you go to those 

1730
01:25:25,110 --> 01:25:25,110
people's pages,
which I do often,

1731
01:25:25,110 --> 01:25:27,250
I don't engage with people in a negative
way online very often.

1732
01:25:27,251 --> 01:25:28,180
Very,
very rarely.

1733
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:29,890
Do you not look at your ad mentions,
are you?

1734
01:25:30,230 --> 01:25:31,620
A little bit.
But you know what,

1735
01:25:31,630 --> 01:25:33,910
man,
I just like to just go on about my day.

1736
01:25:34,420 --> 01:25:37,560
I've found that the negative 
consequences that you're discussing,

1737
01:25:38,220 --> 01:25:42,010
I rare.
It's rare that I go down the rabbit hole

1738
01:25:42,011 --> 01:25:44,480
and I go for days without looking at at 
mentioned.

1739
01:25:44,490 --> 01:25:46,870
I mean it's more that if I publish 
something,

1740
01:25:47,190 --> 01:25:49,390
if I asked for feedback,
I want to see the feedback.

1741
01:25:50,210 --> 01:25:52,180
Silly.
Did anything wrong?

1742
01:25:52,210 --> 01:25:53,530
I mean,
just as your friend.

1743
01:25:53,531 --> 01:25:54,930
I mean I feel like there's nothing wrong
with.

1744
01:25:54,950 --> 01:25:56,770
I look at my app mentions,
but um,

1745
01:25:57,170 --> 01:25:58,850
but you can function in a very different
space.

1746
01:25:58,851 --> 01:26:00,920
I mean,
you're not pushing controversial stuff.

1747
01:26:01,290 --> 01:26:02,580
Definitely not.
Definitely not.

1748
01:26:02,581 --> 01:26:03,660
So I'm,
I agree.

1749
01:26:04,150 --> 01:26:05,540
I'm just fine.
I'm sorry,

1750
01:26:05,541 --> 01:26:05,930
go ahead.
No,

1751
01:26:05,931 --> 01:26:08,180
I was just more worried about,
again,

1752
01:26:08,240 --> 01:26:13,240
back to your psyche like it feels like 
you need a a little bit of a middle 

1753
01:26:13,251 --> 01:26:16,820
ground.
I stay offline after UFC is for the most

1754
01:26:16,821 --> 01:26:19,310
part.
That's when I get the most crazy.

1755
01:26:19,311 --> 01:26:21,800
People said if there's any sort of a 
controversial decision,

1756
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:27,040
but are they criticizing you for 
something you said or they get fucking 

1757
01:26:27,040 --> 01:26:27,800
mad at my commentary.
They'll just disagree with who I thought

1758
01:26:27,890 --> 01:26:29,970
water and when they're so fucking 
vicious about it.

1759
01:26:29,971 --> 01:26:31,370
I'm just like,
just yell.

1760
01:26:31,570 --> 01:26:34,160
Just yell on your own.
You don't want to see any of that.

1761
01:26:34,161 --> 01:26:39,161
There's too many people.
You're dealing with millions and 

1762
01:26:39,161 --> 01:26:42,250
millions of people and who knows how 
many of them are rational when you're 

1763
01:26:42,250 --> 01:26:42,250
dealing with.
You know,

1764
01:26:42,250 --> 01:26:45,461
there's a bit that I had one of my 
specials where I was talking about the 

1765
01:26:45,461 --> 01:26:45,830
number of people that are stupid in the 
world.

1766
01:26:46,040 --> 01:26:48,650
Like if you get a room full of 100 
people,

1767
01:26:48,860 --> 01:26:51,710
the idea that one person isn't a 
complete fucking idiot.

1768
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:55,420
Of course you're being very charitable 
being shared in one,

1769
01:26:55,700 --> 01:27:00,700
but if you do that,
we're talking about 300 million people 

1770
01:27:00,700 --> 01:27:01,280
in the United States.
Plus that's 3 million fucking idiots.

1771
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:06,360
Yeah,
so if you have 3 million fucking idiots 

1772
01:27:06,360 --> 01:27:09,251
and all your ad mentions,
if you look at your ad mentions and $3 

1773
01:27:09,251 --> 01:27:12,501
million comments are saying you're a 
fucking moron and there's just too many 

1774
01:27:13,041 --> 01:27:14,750
people.
The numbers are,

1775
01:27:14,780 --> 01:27:18,320
they're not manageable.
The numbers of human beings you interact

1776
01:27:18,321 --> 01:27:23,321
with online are not manageable.
So anytime anything gets negative or 

1777
01:27:23,321 --> 01:27:24,500
insulting,
and I just check out.

1778
01:27:24,650 --> 01:27:26,180
I just next,
next,

1779
01:27:26,240 --> 01:27:28,340
next.
I don't pay attention because you can't.

1780
01:27:28,550 --> 01:27:31,430
But if I fucked up and I know I fucked 
up,

1781
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:35,570
I think one of the most important things
that I do is I admit that I fuck you and

1782
01:27:35,571 --> 01:27:37,910
I talk about it and I apologize and I 
say,

1783
01:27:37,940 --> 01:27:39,380
look,
I'm flawed.

1784
01:27:39,380 --> 01:27:40,400
I'm human.
I made a mistake.

1785
01:27:40,850 --> 01:27:42,590
Sorry,
and then just step away.

1786
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:45,380
Let the fucking chaos ensue and the 
comments,

1787
01:27:45,410 --> 01:27:47,640
but all the people call you a shill and 
a whatever.

1788
01:27:48,050 --> 01:27:53,050
Let all that happen,
but don't let it in like you're letting 

1789
01:27:53,050 --> 01:27:53,870
it in and then you stew on it and you 
have to bring up,

1790
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:59,200
you know,
a hunter and all these other people and 

1791
01:27:59,200 --> 01:27:59,770
you're letting them way too.
No,

1792
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:00,130
no,
no,

1793
01:28:00,510 --> 01:28:03,400
no.
I perhaps I gave a false impression of,

1794
01:28:03,420 --> 01:28:08,420
of how under my skin this has gotten.
Just the fact that you talked about it 

1795
01:28:08,420 --> 01:28:08,420
at all,
those too much.

1796
01:28:08,420 --> 01:28:08,510
Well,
no,

1797
01:28:08,511 --> 01:28:12,620
but I think it's a huge consequence and 
I think it's given us trump this way,

1798
01:28:12,680 --> 01:28:17,680
this way.
The fact that this style of 

1799
01:28:17,680 --> 01:28:20,240
communication is attractive to so many 
people.

1800
01:28:20,300 --> 01:28:25,300
The fact that you can bluff and bluster 
and empty boast and lives with it being 

1801
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:28,370
caught in lies without consequence.

1802
01:28:28,650 --> 01:28:33,650
Um,
the fact that the people never admit 

1803
01:28:33,650 --> 01:28:33,650
mistakes.
I mean the,

1804
01:28:33,650 --> 01:28:33,750
the,
the,

1805
01:28:33,780 --> 01:28:35,450
what you just described to you,
you do.

1806
01:28:35,451 --> 01:28:36,730
And which I do,
you know,

1807
01:28:36,850 --> 01:28:38,870
you make a mistake.
You want to hear about it.

1808
01:28:38,871 --> 01:28:40,730
You want to correct it as quickly as 
possible,

1809
01:28:40,760 --> 01:28:45,760
right?
That is the antithesis of what we're 

1810
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:45,760
seeing now in this space.
I mean,

1811
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:47,840
it made when has trump admitted a 
mistake,

1812
01:28:47,960 --> 01:28:52,960
but isn't the difference being that 
neither you nor I have any desire to 

1813
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:56,921
control anything like I don't.
I don't want to be the leader of 

1814
01:28:56,921 --> 01:28:56,921
anything.
Well,

1815
01:28:56,921 --> 01:28:56,921
no,
but you want effective.

1816
01:28:56,921 --> 01:28:57,860
Can we?
You want good ideas too?

1817
01:28:57,861 --> 01:29:01,220
I am sure and you want the truth to win.
You want the truth to propagate.

1818
01:29:01,260 --> 01:29:02,010
We want facts to

1819
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:03,780
propagate.
You want to be able to correct errors,

1820
01:29:03,781 --> 01:29:06,660
whether they're your own or others,
especially when they're consequential.

1821
01:29:06,690 --> 01:29:11,690
And I think that we need a.
We need a common ethic where align has 

1822
01:29:12,931 --> 01:29:14,100
real consequences.
I mean,

1823
01:29:14,260 --> 01:29:17,970
so many people are trying to figure out 
what's the antidote to fake news?

1824
01:29:18,570 --> 01:29:22,500
Well,
one antidote is to be caught.

1825
01:29:22,501 --> 01:29:26,370
Line has to be devastating for your 
career,

1826
01:29:26,580 --> 01:29:28,350
right?
Like it hit politically,

1827
01:29:28,380 --> 01:29:31,950
journalistically,
academically as a,

1828
01:29:32,070 --> 01:29:37,070
as a public intellectual.
I mean to be caught in a whopping lie 

1829
01:29:37,070 --> 01:29:41,350
without a will require at minimum some 
serious atonement.

1830
01:29:42,060 --> 01:29:44,000
And historically it has been absolutely

1831
01:29:44,010 --> 01:29:46,420
and it in many spheres

1832
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:51,560
we have slipped those rails just to,
to a degree that I've never thought 

1833
01:29:51,560 --> 01:29:55,131
possible.
We're going lightspeed right into the 

1834
01:29:55,131 --> 01:29:55,131
woods.
Yeah,

1835
01:29:55,131 --> 01:29:58,490
I mean,
we're talking about people have figured 

1836
01:29:58,490 --> 01:30:00,471
out how to,
just to use dishonesty as extra fuel.

1837
01:30:02,190 --> 01:30:02,760
I mean,
it's like,

1838
01:30:02,761 --> 01:30:03,410
it's,
you know,

1839
01:30:03,560 --> 01:30:08,560
the whatever the,
the nitrous oxide boost in those hacky 

1840
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:08,560
cars,
right?

1841
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:10,220
It's like we can use this stuff,
right.

1842
01:30:10,260 --> 01:30:15,260
And the getting the way you behave when 
you get caught just,

1843
01:30:16,260 --> 01:30:18,180
which is to say,
just go fuck yourself.

1844
01:30:18,510 --> 01:30:21,930
Just redounds to your credibility in 
your,

1845
01:30:22,350 --> 01:30:23,490
among your tribe.
Right.

1846
01:30:23,491 --> 01:30:25,420
It's like this guy is so powerful.
He,

1847
01:30:25,500 --> 01:30:25,900
he,
he,

1848
01:30:25,910 --> 01:30:30,910
he,
he so fully doesn't give a shit what 

1849
01:30:30,910 --> 01:30:31,630
people think that he can catch him in a 
lie and just watch how he,

1850
01:30:31,740 --> 01:30:33,760
he gets out of it.
Um,

1851
01:30:33,930 --> 01:30:34,500
and,
but that's,

1852
01:30:34,530 --> 01:30:35,070
that's what,
what,

1853
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:35,610
what,
what I'm,

1854
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:37,590
when I was bringing up these guys,
Mike Cernovich,

1855
01:30:37,591 --> 01:30:38,370
I mean this,
this is,

1856
01:30:38,940 --> 01:30:39,870
um,
I actually,

1857
01:30:39,871 --> 01:30:40,360
I mean,
I,

1858
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:43,290
I trolled Crna,
I decided to troll Cernovich one day and

1859
01:30:43,291 --> 01:30:44,740
I,
I thought it was hilarious and I,

1860
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:47,520
it was just nothing but fun.
So there was only topic about that.

1861
01:30:49,220 --> 01:30:54,220
But,
but the thing that bothers me is that 

1862
01:30:54,220 --> 01:30:56,520
this has real political consequences.
And I think that this is a,

1863
01:30:56,970 --> 01:31:01,970
this is a time period where we're in the
sort of adolescent stage of 

1864
01:31:01,970 --> 01:31:03,880
communication online where you can get 
away

1865
01:31:04,130 --> 01:31:09,130
saying things that are dishonest and 
that there might be some sort of a way 

1866
01:31:09,130 --> 01:31:09,740
to mitigate that in the future.
There might be some.

1867
01:31:10,220 --> 01:31:15,220
I don't think we should act like 
dishonesty and bluff and bluster to use 

1868
01:31:15,220 --> 01:31:17,000
a phrase you used before is started 
somehow knew to the human repertoire.

1869
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:22,040
I get that.
The acceptance of it seems to be though 

1870
01:31:22,040 --> 01:31:24,971
I think we're in a period where that is 
true and I think it is aided and abetted

1871
01:31:25,611 --> 01:31:30,611
by technology and social networks.
I agree with your diagnosis on many 

1872
01:31:30,611 --> 01:31:31,340
levels.
But I,

1873
01:31:31,341 --> 01:31:32,900
you know,
I was having an interesting conversation

1874
01:31:32,901 --> 01:31:36,530
with a guy that you introduced me to 
Joseph Goldstein,

1875
01:31:36,531 --> 01:31:38,470
who was a,
uh,

1876
01:31:38,810 --> 01:31:41,330
eminent meditation teacher,
become my meditation teacher,

1877
01:31:41,630 --> 01:31:43,170
old friend of Sam's.
And he was saying,

1878
01:31:43,180 --> 01:31:45,170
we were talking about the current 
political situation.

1879
01:31:45,350 --> 01:31:48,170
He used a phrase that I like when I was 
asking him what he thought about it,

1880
01:31:48,171 --> 01:31:53,171
he said,
I'm kind of slotting into geological 

1881
01:31:53,171 --> 01:31:55,781
time.
And I think that actually makes some 

1882
01:31:55,781 --> 01:31:55,781
sense not to say that.
What does that mean?

1883
01:31:55,850 --> 01:31:58,640
Meaning that I'm just viewing it from a

1884
01:32:00,130 --> 01:32:05,130
far.
I'm widening the Lens to look at the 

1885
01:32:05,130 --> 01:32:07,810
broad scope of human history to see 
that,

1886
01:32:07,811 --> 01:32:10,990
you know,
over time we've got these ups and downs.

1887
01:32:11,640 --> 01:32:16,640
He's getting to the top of the mountain 
near Denver with a big bucket of 

1888
01:32:16,640 --> 01:32:16,640
Margarita.
So that's exactly right.

1889
01:32:16,640 --> 01:32:20,670
That's exactly right.
I just lucked out with binoculars,

1890
01:32:21,900 --> 01:32:26,900
watch the bombs go off,
learn how to get water out of the 

1891
01:32:26,900 --> 01:32:30,211
ground,
get a solar powered generator and make 

1892
01:32:30,211 --> 01:32:31,230
good Margarita.
I mean,

1893
01:32:31,231 --> 01:32:34,270
it just doesn't seem to me that this is 
sustainable.

1894
01:32:34,420 --> 01:32:37,660
It feels like this is just going to be 
some spectacular moment in history where

1895
01:32:37,661 --> 01:32:40,510
people were Rah Rah Nixon and now they 
look back and go,

1896
01:32:40,511 --> 01:32:43,120
my God,
Nixon was a fucking liar and a buffoon.

1897
01:32:43,390 --> 01:32:44,370
I mean,
take

1898
01:32:44,370 --> 01:32:49,370
this.
This is a point I've made before and I 

1899
01:32:49,370 --> 01:32:49,380
don't think it's original with me.
I think other people have made it,

1900
01:32:49,381 --> 01:32:54,381
but my,
my claim is that if trump were one 10th 

1901
01:32:54,631 --> 01:32:57,540
as bad,
he would appear much worse.

1902
01:32:57,570 --> 01:33:02,570
Because like everything he does now is 
as appearing against a background of so 

1903
01:33:02,570 --> 01:33:06,210
many lies and so much craziness that you
can barely even weight its value.

1904
01:33:06,270 --> 01:33:07,980
But yeah,
I mean just so I just,

1905
01:33:07,981 --> 01:33:12,981
uh,
this is one of the things I find useful 

1906
01:33:12,981 --> 01:33:12,981
about twitter because I follow some very
interesting people.

1907
01:33:12,981 --> 01:33:15,780
And so Anne Applebom,
The Washington Post columnist,

1908
01:33:15,781 --> 01:33:19,380
it was just awesome on twitter.
Everyone should follow her.

1909
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:23,700
She just keeps hammering trump with,
with her own points and other stuff that

1910
01:33:23,701 --> 01:33:26,320
she finds.
And um,

1911
01:33:27,150 --> 01:33:32,150
she just pointed out that.
Did anyone notice that trumped trump 

1912
01:33:32,150 --> 01:33:36,180
threatened a war with North Korea two 
days ago?

1913
01:33:37,290 --> 01:33:42,290
It was in the financial times and yet no
one can talk about it because no one 

1914
01:33:42,290 --> 01:33:43,560
believes him,
right?

1915
01:33:43,620 --> 01:33:44,160
Like,
it's like,

1916
01:33:44,340 --> 01:33:49,340
it's like we have a president whose 
speech has now become so denuded of 

1917
01:33:50,190 --> 01:33:51,570
truth value,
right?

1918
01:33:51,571 --> 01:33:56,571
Perceived truth value that he can say,
you know,

1919
01:33:56,620 --> 01:33:59,190
where if China doesn't handle North 
Korea,

1920
01:33:59,191 --> 01:34:04,191
we're going to.
And no one even feels like they have to 

1921
01:34:04,191 --> 01:34:08,280
ask a followup question on that topic 
because it just,

1922
01:34:08,430 --> 01:34:10,960
everyone assumes as an empty bluff.
I mean,

1923
01:34:10,980 --> 01:34:15,980
images imagined,
like you've just stepped back into the 

1924
01:34:15,980 --> 01:34:18,231
previous presidency of Obama had said,
if China doesn't handle North Korea,

1925
01:34:18,781 --> 01:34:23,340
we will write.
That would be top of the fold.

1926
01:34:24,050 --> 01:34:26,250
This is all we're talking about today,
right?

1927
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:29,130
Like it's just comes out of a blizzard 
of,

1928
01:34:29,190 --> 01:34:31,400
of inanity and craziness that,
that,

1929
01:34:31,420 --> 01:34:31,900
that,
that,

1930
01:34:32,100 --> 01:34:32,620
you know,
he's,

1931
01:34:32,630 --> 01:34:34,450
he's,
he's going after Meryl Streep is,

1932
01:34:34,470 --> 01:34:37,670
he's lying about Obama wiretapping him 
now his,

1933
01:34:37,671 --> 01:34:40,850
he's threatening war with North Korea 
and you know,

1934
01:34:41,070 --> 01:34:42,370
nobody knows what to talk about.

1935
01:34:42,390 --> 01:34:43,640
So it's like the,
the,

1936
01:34:43,710 --> 01:34:48,710
the consequence of this is we have a 
president who not only can he not be 

1937
01:34:49,861 --> 01:34:54,861
trusted to tell the truth,
he can be trusted to lie when ever he 

1938
01:34:55,021 --> 01:34:58,780
thinks that suits his purpose.
And now so,

1939
01:34:58,820 --> 01:34:59,360
so,
so the,

1940
01:34:59,361 --> 01:34:59,640
the,
the,

1941
01:34:59,660 --> 01:35:04,660
the state of mind that everyone's in,
including the press in listening to him 

1942
01:35:04,660 --> 01:35:08,000
is just his to take potentially the most
serious things in the world.

1943
01:35:08,001 --> 01:35:11,930
Not seriously and the least serious 
things in the world.

1944
01:35:12,350 --> 01:35:12,960
Like,
you know,

1945
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:15,860
Meryl Streep or what he thinks of her 
acting,

1946
01:35:16,430 --> 01:35:17,150
you know,
that becomes a,

1947
01:35:17,180 --> 01:35:20,390
that dominates a whole new cycle.
It's very upside down,

1948
01:35:20,391 --> 01:35:24,860
it seems to be to be quite new as 
opposed to the or are perennial,

1949
01:35:24,861 --> 01:35:29,861
but I feel like we're in a very 
different space now with the 

1950
01:35:29,861 --> 01:35:32,330
consequences of of misinformation and we
certainly are.

1951
01:35:32,331 --> 01:35:37,331
Do you think that they're connected to 
what we're talking about before we said 

1952
01:35:37,331 --> 01:35:40,151
that people would rather be electrocuted
than to be alone with their thoughts 

1953
01:35:40,151 --> 01:35:43,220
that we have gotten to this weird place 
with our society,

1954
01:35:43,221 --> 01:35:48,221
with our civilization where we've made 
things so easy and made people so soft,

1955
01:35:48,681 --> 01:35:50,990
so dependent upon technology.

1956
01:35:51,170 --> 01:35:54,360
We've slotted out these paths,
these predetermined patterns of behavior

1957
01:35:54,361 --> 01:35:59,361
to people for people to follow where 
they can just sort of plug into a 

1958
01:35:59,361 --> 01:36:01,370
philosophy,
whether it's a right wing or left wing,

1959
01:36:01,371 --> 01:36:05,420
one with very little room for personal 
thought at all.

1960
01:36:05,620 --> 01:36:07,910
Very little room for objective 
reasoning.

1961
01:36:08,060 --> 01:36:09,430
We've sort of made it easy.
We baby.

1962
01:36:09,910 --> 01:36:14,910
I do think that it's imperative if you 
want to be a good citizen to have a 

1963
01:36:14,910 --> 01:36:19,180
varied media diet,
you're not going to have a clear view of

1964
01:36:19,181 --> 01:36:24,181
the world.
If all you're reading it well for the 

1965
01:36:24,370 --> 01:36:24,880
New York Times,
you know,

1966
01:36:24,910 --> 01:36:27,160
I think you have nothing against the New
York Times or bright part,

1967
01:36:27,161 --> 01:36:32,161
but I think you need to read many things
and follow up many different sorts of 

1968
01:36:32,161 --> 01:36:33,070
people on twitter,
not just because you want to troll them,

1969
01:36:33,071 --> 01:36:38,071
but because you actually want to listen 
to what they have to say and take it 

1970
01:36:38,071 --> 01:36:38,071
serious.
Well,

1971
01:36:38,071 --> 01:36:38,820
the New York Times really fucked up 
where they're really fucked up is well,

1972
01:36:38,821 --> 01:36:40,060
they said that they're going to

1973
01:36:40,410 --> 01:36:45,410
the election.
They're going to rededicate themselves 

1974
01:36:45,410 --> 01:36:46,830
to reporting the truth and read like,
what?

1975
01:36:47,110 --> 01:36:48,540
Why'd she say that?
Like,

1976
01:36:48,600 --> 01:36:50,550
I wish I was there.
I wish I was in the office.

1977
01:36:50,990 --> 01:36:52,980
Why?
That just sends the wrong message.

1978
01:36:53,340 --> 01:36:56,340
We weren't into the truth that says they
are biased.

1979
01:36:56,940 --> 01:36:58,490
They fucked up.
I mean,

1980
01:36:59,670 --> 01:37:01,650
as they were by saying,
you're right,

1981
01:37:02,590 --> 01:37:07,590
the enemy is,
is was so grotesque in this case that it

1982
01:37:09,151 --> 01:37:14,151
was impossible to not have been biased.
Seemed an abdication of responsibility 

1983
01:37:14,151 --> 01:37:19,041
and I feel it myself like people.
Everything I say against trump from a 

1984
01:37:19,041 --> 01:37:21,660
trump person sounds like mirror partisan
bias.

1985
01:37:22,310 --> 01:37:26,550
There's zero connection to the 
Democratic Party or two.

1986
01:37:26,580 --> 01:37:27,480
I mean it's like,
uh,

1987
01:37:28,230 --> 01:37:33,230
there's,
there's no partisan bias and that every 

1988
01:37:33,230 --> 01:37:36,150
100 percent of what I want to say about 
trump does not apply to some other 

1989
01:37:36,571 --> 01:37:38,220
Republican who,
who,

1990
01:37:38,370 --> 01:37:40,970
uh,
is just a stands for things that I don't

1991
01:37:41,080 --> 01:37:42,540
know,
policies I might not like.

1992
01:37:43,320 --> 01:37:47,450
It's completely,
completely unique circumstance and um,

1993
01:37:48,420 --> 01:37:53,420
yeah,
so I mean it's true that you went to 

1994
01:37:53,420 --> 01:37:53,420
read the New York Times for the longest 
time it was,

1995
01:37:53,420 --> 01:37:56,280
it was reading like just the thing had 
become

1996
01:37:56,520 --> 01:37:59,730
the opinion page on the Huffington post 
or something.

1997
01:38:00,090 --> 01:38:03,420
Yeah.
I just feel like at this stage of our,

1998
01:38:03,590 --> 01:38:08,590
our society,
there's real consequences to the infant 

1999
01:38:08,590 --> 01:38:12,390
tylenol if that's actually a word of,
of human beings in our culture.

2000
01:38:12,391 --> 01:38:17,391
We've made it very easy to just go to 
work and just get home and watch 

2001
01:38:17,971 --> 01:38:22,971
television and just not pay attention to
anything and not read anything and not 

2002
01:38:22,971 --> 01:38:25,140
really think and,
and then be manipulated.

2003
01:38:25,610 --> 01:38:30,610
I mean,
I think it's incredibly easy to 

2004
01:38:30,610 --> 01:38:32,871
manipulate people,
especially people that are aware that 

2005
01:38:32,871 --> 01:38:35,811
they don't have a varied media diet.
People that are aware that they don't 

2006
01:38:35,811 --> 01:38:39,951
have a real sense of the word and there 
seems daunting to try to take into 

2007
01:38:39,951 --> 01:38:41,850
consideration like what is,
what is involved in foreign policy,

2008
01:38:41,851 --> 01:38:45,000
what is involved in dealing with Russia,
what is involved?

2009
01:38:45,030 --> 01:38:47,460
How do you negotiate with North Korea?
Fuck,

2010
01:38:47,461 --> 01:38:49,590
it's too much.
Put it in the hands of the strong man.

2011
01:38:49,790 --> 01:38:54,790
This is true on both sides of the 
spectrum though because I think we've 

2012
01:38:54,790 --> 01:38:55,640
got folks um,
who,

2013
01:38:55,700 --> 01:38:58,940
who slot into just a,
a,

2014
01:38:59,030 --> 01:39:02,390
a media diet where they're just hearing 
things on the left and they're not,

2015
01:39:02,610 --> 01:39:06,260
they're not curious about or uh,
um,

2016
01:39:06,710 --> 01:39:11,270
I guess just just not curious enough to 
hear things from a different perspective

2017
01:39:11,271 --> 01:39:16,271
unless it's just some right wing 
political who comes on and they beat 

2018
01:39:16,271 --> 01:39:16,271
them up.
Um,

2019
01:39:16,271 --> 01:39:16,271
so I,
I,

2020
01:39:16,340 --> 01:39:21,340
I,
I really do think and I think it put 

2021
01:39:21,340 --> 01:39:23,290
places,
and this is going to be a self serving 

2022
01:39:23,290 --> 01:39:25,811
argument,
but I do think it places increasing 

2023
01:39:25,811 --> 01:39:28,540
important sun media outlets like the one
for which I work to be really vigilant 

2024
01:39:29,211 --> 01:39:32,090
about being seen as fair arbiters or 
fax.

2025
01:39:32,310 --> 01:39:34,050
Yeah.
I think the consequences have never been

2026
01:39:34,051 --> 01:39:35,370
greater for that.
Absolutely.

2027
01:39:35,371 --> 01:39:38,550
The reason that so many people on the 
right,

2028
01:39:38,551 --> 01:39:40,520
somebody trump's support supporters 
fear,

2029
01:39:40,590 --> 01:39:45,590
feel like they're right is because it 
has been proven that the media was 

2030
01:39:46,711 --> 01:39:51,711
biased and that they did get it all 
wrong and they were absolutely wrong 

2031
01:39:51,711 --> 01:39:55,011
when it came to who was going win.
The huffington post has some ridiculous 

2032
01:39:55,011 --> 01:39:58,431
thing where it was the night of the 
election and they said that Hillary had 

2033
01:39:58,431 --> 01:40:00,120
like a 98 percent chance of winning or 
something crazy like that.

2034
01:40:00,190 --> 01:40:05,190
Well,
I think there were some polls that were 

2035
01:40:05,190 --> 01:40:05,190
bad,
but the pole like the,

2036
01:40:05,190 --> 01:40:09,260
because I remember this because I sent 
out a tweet which said like by,

2037
01:40:09,270 --> 01:40:12,470
by Donald or something like that,
the day of.

2038
01:40:12,780 --> 01:40:15,840
But when I did that,
I mean that wasn't a prediction and the,

2039
01:40:15,850 --> 01:40:20,850
the,
the polls that I was going by that most 

2040
01:40:20,850 --> 01:40:21,270
people were going by that point,
it was like 80 slash 20,

2041
01:40:21,290 --> 01:40:26,290
you know,
or at best 75 slash 25 that she was 

2042
01:40:26,290 --> 01:40:26,290
going to win.
Now that's not.

2043
01:40:26,290 --> 01:40:27,930
I mean,
you roll dice for a few minutes,

2044
01:40:27,931 --> 01:40:30,900
you realize 20 percent chance comes up a
lot,

2045
01:40:31,440 --> 01:40:35,220
so I guess that's infinite test.
Melodic plus Florida.

2046
01:40:35,870 --> 01:40:36,360
Yeah,
but,

2047
01:40:36,361 --> 01:40:36,690
but,
so,

2048
01:40:36,820 --> 01:40:37,420
but.
Well,

2049
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:42,440
you should,
you should tell the story about what it 

2050
01:40:42,440 --> 01:40:42,440
was like to anchor.
Yeah,

2051
01:40:42,440 --> 01:40:42,440
well I guess.
Yeah.

2052
01:40:42,440 --> 01:40:43,960
So I was anchoring the ABC News digital 
coverage that night.

2053
01:40:43,990 --> 01:40:45,590
Um,
and uh,

2054
01:40:45,690 --> 01:40:46,580
you know,
they,

2055
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:51,800
they give you the exit polling,
well you're not supposed to report it 

2056
01:40:51,800 --> 01:40:52,660
publicly,
but the exit polling that we were seeing

2057
01:40:52,920 --> 01:40:57,920
before we went on the air late in the 
day really made it seem like it's going 

2058
01:40:57,920 --> 01:41:00,721
to be a Clinton landslide.
And now you have all these folks who 

2059
01:41:00,721 --> 01:41:03,631
say,
look at the crest fallen faces of the 

2060
01:41:03,631 --> 01:41:04,060
journalists because they're so upset 
that trump won.

2061
01:41:04,300 --> 01:41:08,740
Certainly that was not the case for the 
folks on my set was that it was,

2062
01:41:08,770 --> 01:41:11,220
that we didn't see it coming.
We weren't prepared for it.

2063
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:16,440
Everything that we're seeing in terms of
the math made it look like this was a 

2064
01:41:16,440 --> 01:41:16,750
Clinton victory.
A shoe in.

2065
01:41:16,930 --> 01:41:18,790
It was just about just tying a ribbon 
around it.

2066
01:41:18,910 --> 01:41:23,910
So when the night became long,
there was just confusion about what was 

2067
01:41:23,910 --> 01:41:25,090
going on,
how do they get it so wrong.

2068
01:41:25,400 --> 01:41:30,400
You know,
I think it actually goes back to what 

2069
01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:33,931
Sam was saying before that people think 
when you see numbers like 70 percent is 

2070
01:41:34,790 --> 01:41:37,800
that Clinton's going to win 80 percent 
odds that Clinton's going to win that,

2071
01:41:38,120 --> 01:41:43,120
that she's definitely going to win.
But there's room there for trump to a 

2072
01:41:45,011 --> 01:41:46,160
lot of room there for whatever

2073
01:41:46,210 --> 01:41:50,530
present comes up all the time.
It's Russian roulette bills or bad.

2074
01:41:50,531 --> 01:41:52,090
If it's Russian roulette,
those are bad odds.

2075
01:41:52,091 --> 01:41:55,030
Right?
You're not going to take that one single

2076
01:41:55,031 --> 01:41:56,040
bullet,
right?

2077
01:41:56,840 --> 01:41:58,190
Yeah.
No,

2078
01:41:58,400 --> 01:41:59,170
you're a hunter.
Yeah.

2079
01:41:59,770 --> 01:42:01,090
That's really good.
Awesome.

2080
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:06,840
I don't think so.
It's so much about blaming the polls as 

2081
01:42:06,840 --> 01:42:07,630
it was blaming the overall tenor of the 
coverage,

2082
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:10,180
which made it seem like Clinton was 
inevitable.

2083
01:42:10,190 --> 01:42:11,140
Yeah.
Yeah.

2084
01:42:11,141 --> 01:42:12,090
It just,
it was.

2085
01:42:12,120 --> 01:42:14,230
It was so shocking.
That's a hit.

2086
01:42:14,260 --> 01:42:15,350
That's a hit.
I think that we,

2087
01:42:15,460 --> 01:42:17,200
we can and should take.
Yeah,

2088
01:42:17,650 --> 01:42:19,390
we definitely know.
I think we,

2089
01:42:19,420 --> 01:42:24,420
we weren't giving the 20 or 30 percent 
chance a serious enough look.

2090
01:42:25,380 --> 01:42:27,930
What is your thought as being someone 
who covers these things?

2091
01:42:27,931 --> 01:42:30,660
What is your thought about the electoral
college?

2092
01:42:31,020 --> 01:42:33,180
Do you think that that's an antiquated 
idea and then,

2093
01:42:33,400 --> 01:42:35,400
I mean,
it was kind of established back when you

2094
01:42:35,401 --> 01:42:40,401
really needed a representative because 
otherwise you would have to get on a 

2095
01:42:40,401 --> 01:42:41,520
fucking horse and ride into Washington 
and it would take six months.

2096
01:42:41,800 --> 01:42:46,800
I can see the,
you can make very powerful arguments 

2097
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:48,130
that it's deeply problematic 
institution.

2098
01:42:48,160 --> 01:42:53,160
I can see the,
I can see the power of those arguments 

2099
01:42:53,160 --> 01:42:53,160
for sure.
Um,

2100
01:42:53,160 --> 01:42:58,050
there are people who argue make similar 
arguments about the United States 

2101
01:42:58,050 --> 01:42:58,250
Senate.
Yeah.

2102
01:42:58,480 --> 01:42:59,930
Um,
uh,

2103
01:42:59,950 --> 01:43:00,340
there was,
uh,

2104
01:43:00,460 --> 01:43:03,400
there was a piece that ran in the New 
York Times,

2105
01:43:03,460 --> 01:43:08,460
uh,
in their Sunday we can review not long 

2106
01:43:08,460 --> 01:43:11,971
after the election making the case that 
the angriest people in America actually 

2107
01:43:11,971 --> 01:43:14,970
should be those live on the coast 
because it's taxation without 

2108
01:43:14,970 --> 01:43:17,941
representation that we,
that the people who live on the coast 

2109
01:43:17,941 --> 01:43:21,301
are paying more in taxes,
but they have less representation 

2110
01:43:21,301 --> 01:43:21,930
actually in Washington.
Um,

2111
01:43:22,630 --> 01:43:23,290
again,
this,

2112
01:43:23,300 --> 01:43:25,060
I,
that's not research that I've done,

2113
01:43:25,061 --> 01:43:26,320
but it's an interesting idea.

2114
01:43:26,660 --> 01:43:31,660
Have you ever seen anybody present any 
sort of a logical argument that there 

2115
01:43:31,660 --> 01:43:36,131
really shouldn't be a president anymore,
that the idea of having one alpha champ 

2116
01:43:36,131 --> 01:43:40,450
run this whole thing seems pretty 
outdated and just not sure that he runs 

2117
01:43:40,450 --> 01:43:42,020
the whole thing,
but he's got a lot of info.

2118
01:43:42,270 --> 01:43:43,600
It's an enormous amount of influence,
but,

2119
01:43:43,830 --> 01:43:48,830
but we're seeing Donald Trump is seeing 
right now the limits of presidential 

2120
01:43:49,171 --> 01:43:51,350
power.
He couldn't get his,

2121
01:43:51,410 --> 01:43:53,600
uh,
the healthcare bill that they,

2122
01:43:53,700 --> 01:43:57,980
that didn't even make it wasn't even 
close to what he promised on the,

2123
01:43:57,990 --> 01:44:01,610
or in some ways wasn't even close to 
what he promised in the campaign trail.

2124
01:44:01,760 --> 01:44:06,760
In other words,
he couldn't get the bill that he wanted 

2125
01:44:06,760 --> 01:44:10,210
and then he couldn't get that passed.
And now he's looking at having to watch 

2126
01:44:10,210 --> 01:44:12,660
his party employed the nuclear option in
order to get a,

2127
01:44:12,710 --> 01:44:16,470
his supreme court nominee a seated.
So I,

2128
01:44:17,120 --> 01:44:22,120
I don't know.
I think that the founders designed in 

2129
01:44:22,120 --> 01:44:26,171
many ways a really ingenious system and 
we put a lot of attention on the 

2130
01:44:26,171 --> 01:44:30,011
president because it's one person who 
get who's in our on our TV screens or 

2131
01:44:30,011 --> 01:44:34,841
our phones all the time,
but I'm not sure how much power is 

2132
01:44:34,841 --> 01:44:35,600
vested in that person.
Now when it comes to foreign policy,

2133
01:44:36,410 --> 01:44:37,970
it's a different kettle of fish.

2134
01:44:38,070 --> 01:44:43,070
Well,
it's enough that the EPA has been sort 

2135
01:44:43,070 --> 01:44:46,161
of hobbled.
I mean what they've done with the 

2136
01:44:46,161 --> 01:44:46,161
environmental protection agency 
standards,

2137
01:44:46,161 --> 01:44:50,100
especially when it regards to emissions.
He's rolled back emission standards.

2138
01:44:50,250 --> 01:44:52,200
I mean there's anything that we should 
be concerned about.

2139
01:44:52,201 --> 01:44:56,360
It's the air that we breathe and we are 
moving in a direction we.

2140
01:44:56,361 --> 01:45:01,361
We're clearly moving in a direction to 
get away from things like coal and he's 

2141
01:45:01,361 --> 01:45:02,400
going the opposite way.
Not only that,

2142
01:45:02,401 --> 01:45:07,401
but what I've heard is that that's not 
even going to be effective because most 

2143
01:45:08,101 --> 01:45:13,101
places have moved away from coal to the 
point where restarting coal production 

2144
01:45:13,540 --> 01:45:18,540
is not even gonna recharge the economy 
in the way that would make it a viable 

2145
01:45:19,441 --> 01:45:20,520
option in the first place.

2146
01:45:20,790 --> 01:45:23,350
The issue of climate change is just,
um,

2147
01:45:24,610 --> 01:45:27,510
I'll say as a member of the media and 
area where I feel,

2148
01:45:27,610 --> 01:45:32,070
I'm just speaking for myself,
I'm really one of our biggest failures,

2149
01:45:32,170 --> 01:45:34,380
um,
and I don't think history is going to go

2150
01:45:34,381 --> 01:45:37,950
just kindly and I get off,
I'll put the blame on myself.

2151
01:45:38,250 --> 01:45:43,250
It's become,
it's a hard story to get people just 

2152
01:45:43,250 --> 01:45:43,710
interested in,
um,

2153
01:45:44,190 --> 01:45:49,190
and especially for television because 
it's a lot of sort of graphs and 

2154
01:45:49,190 --> 01:45:49,270
science.
Um,

2155
01:45:49,500 --> 01:45:54,500
and you,
there's only so many pictures of polar 

2156
01:45:54,500 --> 01:45:54,500
bears you can show.
Um,

2157
01:45:54,600 --> 01:45:59,600
and so I've,
I anguish about that because I do think 

2158
01:45:59,600 --> 01:45:59,600
it's,
it's,

2159
01:45:59,600 --> 01:46:00,900
uh,
there isn't a debate.

2160
01:46:02,040 --> 01:46:05,850
Climate change is real,
almost certainly caused by humans.

2161
01:46:06,860 --> 01:46:09,780
I don't think we.
And for too long we fell for that in the

2162
01:46:09,781 --> 01:46:13,160
media where we presented it as a debate 
when it wasn't a.

2163
01:46:13,380 --> 01:46:18,380
Now I think we're past that,
but I still don't think we're covering 

2164
01:46:18,380 --> 01:46:18,380
it enough and as robustly as we should.

2165
01:46:18,600 --> 01:46:23,010
Climate change I think is very sort of 
almost abstract to people.

2166
01:46:23,011 --> 01:46:25,170
It's very difficult for them to wrap 
their head around,

2167
01:46:25,171 --> 01:46:29,310
especially when they look at the ice 
core samples and there's plenty of stuff

2168
01:46:29,311 --> 01:46:34,311
online where you could sort of convince 
yourself that there's always been this 

2169
01:46:34,311 --> 01:46:36,180
rise and fall of the temperature on the 
earth.

2170
01:46:36,210 --> 01:46:40,590
In many ways that is true,
but pollution is another thing.

2171
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:45,800
I think.
I think actually I just walked in so I 

2172
01:46:45,800 --> 01:46:49,131
might have missed what you said there,
but I think that's a crucial shift of 

2173
01:46:49,131 --> 01:46:50,490
emphasis.
There is no

2174
01:46:51,060 --> 01:46:55,020
argument about air pollution runs 
consequences.

2175
01:46:55,021 --> 01:47:00,021
It's undesirability.
I mean like you don't want particulates 

2176
01:47:00,021 --> 01:47:01,650
in your lungs that you don't need to 
have there.

2177
01:47:01,680 --> 01:47:06,680
And the idea that we could see,
you could completely justify a green 

2178
01:47:06,721 --> 01:47:11,721
economy on that basis alone.
Maybe it just imagine if we had no 

2179
01:47:12,870 --> 01:47:16,440
pollution coming from the exhaust of all
the cars out there and there was no coal

2180
01:47:16,441 --> 01:47:21,441
fired power plants.
We just had solar and wind and and you 

2181
01:47:21,441 --> 01:47:25,391
know,
safe nuclear technology powering the 

2182
01:47:25,391 --> 01:47:26,790
grid.
It will be fantastic from just a pure.

2183
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:28,760
I mean forget about the health.
It just taught me the,

2184
01:47:28,930 --> 01:47:32,740
obviously cancers is,
is a lung cancer and,

2185
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:37,590
and cardiovascular diseases is a huge 
issue there.

2186
01:47:37,591 --> 01:47:40,620
But just aesthetically it's,
it's so desirable.

2187
01:47:40,621 --> 01:47:45,621
I mean,
there's no argument against it and 

2188
01:47:45,621 --> 01:47:47,470
that's,
I feel like people don't make that 

2189
01:47:47,470 --> 01:47:47,470
connection

2190
01:47:47,470 --> 01:47:48,590
because climate change is slow moving,
you know,

2191
01:47:48,620 --> 01:47:52,160
and it could be way out in the future 
before pollution isn't.

2192
01:47:52,161 --> 01:47:53,040
I know,
you know,

2193
01:47:53,300 --> 01:47:56,780
but it pollution is a much less 
controversial than climate change.

2194
01:47:56,800 --> 01:47:58,190
Well,
that's why this coal thing,

2195
01:47:58,191 --> 01:48:02,480
so disturbing.
Reigniting this production of coal.

2196
01:48:02,570 --> 01:48:03,530
Yeah,
it's unbelievable.

2197
01:48:03,560 --> 01:48:04,790
It's ridiculous.
I mean,

2198
01:48:04,800 --> 01:48:07,880
I guess I have questions about whether 
it's even going to happen.

2199
01:48:08,330 --> 01:48:10,310
In other words,
you can roll it back.

2200
01:48:11,150 --> 01:48:14,120
But the coal industry,
there are many,

2201
01:48:14,150 --> 01:48:15,270
many,
uh,

2202
01:48:15,300 --> 01:48:20,300
they,
they are many factors to their decision 

2203
01:48:20,300 --> 01:48:20,300
making about,
for example,

2204
01:48:20,300 --> 01:48:21,440
will,
if they go and do the mining is,

2205
01:48:21,710 --> 01:48:23,200
is what they,
uh,

2206
01:48:23,201 --> 01:48:26,000
a mine going to actually even be 
consumed.

2207
01:48:26,180 --> 01:48:27,830
So I uh,
you know,

2208
01:48:27,831 --> 01:48:32,831
and I,
I think that even though they're doing 

2209
01:48:32,831 --> 01:48:32,831
some pretty radical,
making some pretty radical noises at the

2210
01:48:32,831 --> 01:48:35,780
EPA,
I'm not sure how far pruitt can,

2211
01:48:36,020 --> 01:48:41,020
can take some of this stuff given the 
existing body of law case law that has 

2212
01:48:41,331 --> 01:48:45,680
formed around a Obama's decisions.
So I think it gets,

2213
01:48:45,681 --> 01:48:49,250
it gets pretty more complicated the 
closer you look at it,

2214
01:48:49,251 --> 01:48:52,970
from what I can tell and I won't claim 
to have studied it too too closely,

2215
01:48:53,120 --> 01:48:55,410
but it seems to get more complicated.
The more you look at it,

2216
01:48:56,030 --> 01:48:59,090
the headlines maybe scarier,
I guess is my point.

2217
01:48:59,300 --> 01:49:04,300
Well,
what's pretty clear though is emission 

2218
01:49:04,300 --> 01:49:04,300
standards rolling

2219
01:49:04,300 --> 01:49:07,040
back emission standard sends a very 
clear message that it's okay to pollute 

2220
01:49:07,040 --> 01:49:07,040
the air.
I mean it's,

2221
01:49:07,040 --> 01:49:09,570
we were moving in a direction of going 
towards electric cars,

2222
01:49:09,571 --> 01:49:12,510
going towards cars that pollute the 
environment less.

2223
01:49:12,600 --> 01:49:16,200
I mean even cars that use gas,
you know,

2224
01:49:16,230 --> 01:49:21,230
for a Porsche,
porsche has a nine slash 11 turbo and 

2225
01:49:21,230 --> 01:49:22,800
the standards of emissions are so 
strong.

2226
01:49:22,801 --> 01:49:25,890
What they've developed as a car that you
drive it through La,

2227
01:49:26,250 --> 01:49:28,680
the exhaust that comes out is cleaner 
than the air.

2228
01:49:28,681 --> 01:49:29,280
It sucks in.

2229
01:49:30,080 --> 01:49:30,320
Hmm.

2230
01:49:31,570 --> 01:49:34,060
Imagine that you're driving through.
It's an air filter.

2231
01:49:34,090 --> 01:49:35,890
Yeah.
It really is bad air filter.

2232
01:49:35,940 --> 01:49:38,070
It can be done very expensive hair 
filming.

2233
01:49:38,120 --> 01:49:39,640
It can be done.
I mean that's.

2234
01:49:39,960 --> 01:49:44,960
I mean,
and we can move further and further 

2235
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:47,341
away.
I mean obviously the problem with that 

2236
01:49:47,341 --> 01:49:47,800
is it's taking in polluted air.
That's the issue in the first place.

2237
01:49:47,801 --> 01:49:50,020
I mean it's not clean.
You don't want to breathe the exhaust of

2238
01:49:50,021 --> 01:49:54,070
a Porsche,
but what they've done is managed to make

2239
01:49:54,071 --> 01:49:59,071
something so efficient that it actually 
does emit clean air coming out of it or 

2240
01:50:00,041 --> 01:50:02,080
cleaner than the polluted air that it's 
sucking in.

2241
01:50:02,620 --> 01:50:05,080
Now,
if these environmental protection agency

2242
01:50:05,081 --> 01:50:09,400
standards keep getting rolled back,
I mean we're going to go back to.

2243
01:50:09,880 --> 01:50:11,470
I mean I don't know how far the rolling 
it back,

2244
01:50:11,471 --> 01:50:16,471
but what you said is so clear.
There's nothing good about polluting the

2245
01:50:17,381 --> 01:50:22,381
air.
I mean it's what we need to breathe and 

2246
01:50:22,381 --> 01:50:24,781
there's options.
The idea that business should take 

2247
01:50:24,781 --> 01:50:26,980
precedent over the actual environment 
that we need to sustain ourselves.

2248
01:50:27,100 --> 01:50:32,100
So let's not forget there are a real 
human beings in coal country who have 

2249
01:50:32,100 --> 01:50:33,280
generations of,
I've done,

2250
01:50:33,340 --> 01:50:35,860
have spent generations working in the 
industry,

2251
01:50:36,190 --> 01:50:41,190
take great pride in it,
and we've got to think about what we do.

2252
01:50:42,540 --> 01:50:46,860
It's only the numbers here as uprising 
and also little reported.

2253
01:50:47,370 --> 01:50:52,370
It's only 75,000
coal jobs we're talking about in the 

2254
01:50:52,370 --> 01:50:54,800
country and there's something like 
500,000

2255
01:50:54,801 --> 01:50:57,690
clean tech jobs just in California 
alone.

2256
01:50:57,691 --> 01:50:59,130
I mean,
the numbers are completely out of it.

2257
01:50:59,280 --> 01:51:00,030
No,
I think.

2258
01:51:00,060 --> 01:51:02,220
I think the cleantech to,
um,

2259
01:51:02,280 --> 01:51:07,280
uh,
industry offers an enormous amount of 

2260
01:51:07,280 --> 01:51:07,280
promise,
but 75,000

2261
01:51:07,280 --> 01:51:07,620
families is not nothing.

2262
01:51:07,710 --> 01:51:09,600
And when we're talking about and give 
them money,

2263
01:51:10,110 --> 01:51:14,640
they don't want to end up going to work.
This goes to the question of meaning and

2264
01:51:14,641 --> 01:51:16,020
you know,
like what are we going to do?

2265
01:51:16,021 --> 01:51:20,400
Because we're on the precipice.
We're getting to is everyone.

2266
01:51:20,401 --> 01:51:23,400
Virtually everyone is going to be in the
position of these coal miners.

2267
01:51:23,430 --> 01:51:28,430
When,
when you were talking about and that 

2268
01:51:28,430 --> 01:51:28,430
that's a good thing.
That's the thing,

2269
01:51:28,430 --> 01:51:28,430
I mean,
that's,

2270
01:51:28,430 --> 01:51:33,370
that's why can't they figure out that 
they just want to learn new languages 

2271
01:51:33,370 --> 01:51:34,380
and spend more time with their kids and 
play Frisbee and,

2272
01:51:34,890 --> 01:51:36,810
and uh,
have fun.

2273
01:51:37,140 --> 01:51:42,140
We need a new ethic that and politics 
that decouples a person's claim on 

2274
01:51:45,600 --> 01:51:49,860
existence from doing profitable work 
that someone will pay you for.

2275
01:51:49,950 --> 01:51:51,170
It says a lot of that work is going on.

2276
01:51:51,230 --> 01:51:51,950
We could,
I mean,

2277
01:51:51,951 --> 01:51:56,951
we could view it as an opportunity and 
it is actually something that it does 

2278
01:51:56,951 --> 01:51:59,480
dovetail with this hobby horse that you 
and I have been on for awhile about,

2279
01:51:59,810 --> 01:52:00,960
about,
um,

2280
01:52:01,010 --> 01:52:06,010
kind of about the power of meditation 
and what it can do to a human mind and 

2281
01:52:06,010 --> 01:52:07,640
the way you view the world and your role
in it.

2282
01:52:07,760 --> 01:52:08,180
For sure.

2283
01:52:08,810 --> 01:52:10,700
What are you thoughts on universal basic
income?

2284
01:52:10,701 --> 01:52:15,701
Because bring,
bring it back to that with this rise of 

2285
01:52:15,701 --> 01:52:15,701
the machines.
If we do have things automated,

2286
01:52:15,701 --> 01:52:20,530
I mean some ridiculous number of people 
make their living driving cars and 

2287
01:52:20,530 --> 01:52:22,280
driving trucks now when that,
when those jobs are gone,

2288
01:52:22,460 --> 01:52:23,440
I think it's millions of people.

2289
01:52:24,220 --> 01:52:26,710
It's,
I think it is in the states,

2290
01:52:26,711 --> 01:52:31,711
it's the most common job for white men.
I think something like 9 million white 

2291
01:52:35,471 --> 01:52:38,920
men are driving trucks and cars,
and the problem with that is most people

2292
01:52:38,930 --> 01:52:41,410
like fuck white men,
white men,

2293
01:52:41,700 --> 01:52:44,890
patriarchy.
This is trump's.

2294
01:52:45,390 --> 01:52:46,840
Yeah,
no,

2295
01:52:46,900 --> 01:52:48,860
it's these,
um,

2296
01:52:50,570 --> 01:52:52,460
I think universal basic income.
There,

2297
01:52:52,510 --> 01:52:56,180
there reasons to worry that it's not a 
perfect solution because you do want,

2298
01:52:56,630 --> 01:52:59,320
you want to incentivize the things you 
want to incentivize you to.

2299
01:52:59,321 --> 01:53:01,730
You need to just understand the 
consequences of,

2300
01:53:02,480 --> 01:53:07,480
of any system you would put in place,
but there's just no question that in the

2301
01:53:09,170 --> 01:53:11,040
viewed as an opportunity,
this is,

2302
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:13,940
this is the greatest opportunity in 
human history.

2303
01:53:13,941 --> 01:53:18,941
We're talking about canceling the need 
for dangerous,

2304
01:53:19,341 --> 01:53:24,341
boring,
repetitive work and freeing up humanity 

2305
01:53:25,790 --> 01:53:28,220
to do interesting,
creative,

2306
01:53:28,221 --> 01:53:29,420
fun things.
Now,

2307
01:53:29,421 --> 01:53:30,800
how could that be bad?
Well,

2308
01:53:31,340 --> 01:53:33,680
give us a little time and we'll show you
how we can make it bad,

2309
01:53:33,710 --> 01:53:38,710
but it'll,
it'll be bad if it leads to just 

2310
01:53:38,710 --> 01:53:41,030
extraordinary wealth inequality that we 
have.

2311
01:53:41,070 --> 01:53:43,790
We don't have the political or ethical 
will to,

2312
01:53:44,110 --> 01:53:49,110
to fix.
And because if we have a culture of 

2313
01:53:49,110 --> 01:53:53,141
people who think I don't want any 
handouts and I certainly don't want my 

2314
01:53:53,141 --> 01:53:54,160
neighbor to get any handouts and I don't
want to pay any taxes so that he gets,

2315
01:53:54,500 --> 01:53:57,710
he can be a lazy bum if that's the,
if we have this,

2316
01:53:57,980 --> 01:53:59,480
you know,
hangover from,

2317
01:53:59,510 --> 01:54:00,290
from,
uh,

2318
01:54:00,550 --> 01:54:01,800
uh,
calvinism,

2319
01:54:01,990 --> 01:54:06,990
you know,
that makes it impossible to talk 

2320
01:54:06,990 --> 01:54:10,010
creatively and reasonably about what has
changed.

2321
01:54:10,340 --> 01:54:15,340
Yeah.
That it could be a very painful 

2322
01:54:15,340 --> 01:54:15,860
bottleneck we have to pass through until
we get to something that is,

2323
01:54:16,460 --> 01:54:17,310
that is,
um,

2324
01:54:17,750 --> 01:54:20,660
much better or a hell of a lot worse 
depending on,

2325
01:54:20,730 --> 01:54:24,030
on where the technology goes.
And I think at a certain point the,

2326
01:54:24,280 --> 01:54:28,340
the wealth inequality will be obviously 
unsustainable.

2327
01:54:28,430 --> 01:54:33,430
I mean,
you can't have multiple trillionaires 

2328
01:54:33,430 --> 01:54:35,860
walking around living in compounds with 
razor wire and just moving everywhere by

2329
01:54:38,660 --> 01:54:39,560
private jet.

2330
01:54:39,950 --> 01:54:41,330
Um,
and then,

2331
01:54:41,900 --> 01:54:46,900
you know,
massive levels of unemployment in a 

2332
01:54:46,900 --> 01:54:46,960
society like ours.
I mean,

2333
01:54:47,120 --> 01:54:52,120
at a certain point where the richest 
people will realize that enough is 

2334
01:54:53,421 --> 01:54:58,421
enough.
We have to spread this wealth because 

2335
01:54:58,421 --> 01:54:59,330
otherwise people are just going to show 
up at our compounds with,

2336
01:54:59,360 --> 01:55:03,410
with their ar fifteens or their 
pitchforks and you know,

2337
01:55:03,411 --> 01:55:08,380
that the society will not sustain it,
mean you can't use the,

2338
01:55:08,620 --> 01:55:13,620
there has to be some level of wealth 
inequality that is unsustainable that 

2339
01:55:13,620 --> 01:55:13,760
people,
people will not tolerate.

2340
01:55:14,380 --> 01:55:17,000
Um,
and you begin to look more and more like

2341
01:55:17,001 --> 01:55:20,150
a banana republic until you become a 
banana republic.

2342
01:55:20,151 --> 01:55:22,580
But now we were talking about,
you know,

2343
01:55:22,800 --> 01:55:27,800
the US or,
or the developed world where all the 

2344
01:55:27,800 --> 01:55:31,790
wealth is a.
So redistribution is the end game.

2345
01:55:32,020 --> 01:55:37,020
We and that's that.
But that's a toxic concept for half of 

2346
01:55:37,020 --> 01:55:40,720
the country right now where the idea of 
the welfare state in perpetuating that 

2347
01:55:40,720 --> 01:55:41,840
and spreading it across the board.

2348
01:55:41,870 --> 01:55:44,100
Yeah.
But these are so,

2349
01:55:44,670 --> 01:55:45,130
yeah,
I mean,

2350
01:55:45,570 --> 01:55:48,210
whatever the solution is for coal 
mining,

2351
01:55:48,720 --> 01:55:51,450
we should not be hostage for the coal 
miners.

2352
01:55:51,900 --> 01:55:56,900
We should not be hostage to the idea 
that they need jobs so that whatever job

2353
01:55:59,221 --> 01:56:04,221
they were doing and are still qualified 
to do that job has to continue to exist 

2354
01:56:04,890 --> 01:56:09,890
no matter what.
No matter what the environmental 

2355
01:56:09,890 --> 01:56:10,470
consequences,
no matter what the health consequences,

2356
01:56:10,471 --> 01:56:13,320
no matter well how it closes the door to
good things that we,

2357
01:56:13,321 --> 01:56:16,020
we want,
we don't do that with any that we didn't

2358
01:56:16,021 --> 01:56:19,170
do that with the people who are making 
buggy whips or,

2359
01:56:19,171 --> 01:56:20,820
or anything.
Slavery.

2360
01:56:20,880 --> 01:56:21,720
Yeah.
Or Yeah.

2361
01:56:21,721 --> 01:56:24,090
I mean that's just,
there's no,

2362
01:56:24,290 --> 01:56:29,290
I'm at a certain point we move on and we
make progress and we don't let that 

2363
01:56:29,401 --> 01:56:34,401
progress get rolled back.
And when you're talking about a 

2364
01:56:34,401 --> 01:56:38,030
developing technology that produces 
energy that doesn't have any of these 

2365
01:56:39,060 --> 01:56:41,500
negative effects,
um,

2366
01:56:41,580 --> 01:56:46,580
you know,
whether it's global climate change or 

2367
01:56:46,580 --> 01:56:49,671
just pollution,
of course we have to move in that 

2368
01:56:49,671 --> 01:56:49,671
direction.

2369
01:56:49,671 --> 01:56:52,910
And the other thing that's crazy is that
we're not talking honestly about how the

2370
01:56:53,880 --> 01:56:55,980
dirty tech is subsidized.
I mean,

2371
01:56:55,981 --> 01:56:57,840
you have the oil.
People say,

2372
01:56:58,410 --> 01:57:00,450
well,
solar is all subsidized,

2373
01:57:00,451 --> 01:57:01,110
right?
This is,

2374
01:57:01,320 --> 01:57:04,980
is this a government handout that's 
given us the solar industry?

2375
01:57:05,340 --> 01:57:05,820
Well,
one,

2376
01:57:05,821 --> 01:57:10,821
that's not even that you have to produce
an argument as to why that's a bad 

2377
01:57:10,821 --> 01:57:10,821
thing.
We,

2378
01:57:10,821 --> 01:57:11,220
this is something we should want the 
government to do.

2379
01:57:11,221 --> 01:57:16,221
The government needs to incentivize new 
industries that the market can't 

2380
01:57:16,711 --> 01:57:17,790
incentivize.
Now,

2381
01:57:17,820 --> 01:57:21,450
if there are industries that are just 
intrinsically good and are going to lead

2382
01:57:21,451 --> 01:57:26,451
to the betterment of humanity,
but carbon is massively subsidized.

2383
01:57:27,361 --> 01:57:28,380
We Ha,
we don't have,

2384
01:57:28,410 --> 01:57:32,130
I mean if we actually had the,
the,

2385
01:57:32,250 --> 01:57:34,490
the coal producers,
um,

2386
01:57:34,880 --> 01:57:39,880
and the,
and the petroleum producers pay for the 

2387
01:57:39,880 --> 01:57:41,850
consequences of,
of carbon and pollution.

2388
01:57:42,200 --> 01:57:47,200
It would be,
it would be much more expensive than it 

2389
01:57:47,200 --> 01:57:47,200
is,
right?

2390
01:57:47,200 --> 01:57:47,200
So it's already subsidized,
you know,

2391
01:57:47,200 --> 01:57:47,340
we do it.
So we should,

2392
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:48,350
I mean,
we,

2393
01:57:48,351 --> 01:57:49,770
we,
we need a carbon tax.

2394
01:57:49,771 --> 01:57:54,420
Clearly we need to the tax code to 
incentivize what we want to incentivize.

2395
01:57:54,450 --> 01:57:59,450
Well,
there's a ton of industries in this 

2396
01:57:59,450 --> 01:57:59,450
country that you could make that 
argument for.

2397
01:57:59,450 --> 01:58:02,840
The corn industry is one subsidizing the
corn industry and when you find out the 

2398
01:58:02,840 --> 01:58:07,231
corn and corn syrup is responsible for.
I'm just a huge epidemic of obesity in 

2399
01:58:08,551 --> 01:58:13,551
this country.
And the amount of corn syrup that's in 

2400
01:58:13,551 --> 01:58:13,551
foods.
If you have USA,

2401
01:58:13,950 --> 01:58:18,950
USA polluter had to pay the,
the consequences of your pollution all 

2402
01:58:19,501 --> 01:58:20,940
the way down the line,
right?

2403
01:58:21,280 --> 01:58:26,280
Um,
you had to compensate everyone who got 

2404
01:58:26,280 --> 01:58:30,030
emphysema or lung cancer because of what
you were putting into the air,

2405
01:58:30,480 --> 01:58:33,390
your industry,
it would be less profitable,

2406
01:58:33,420 --> 01:58:38,420
right.
And it might not be profitable at all 

2407
01:58:38,420 --> 01:58:38,420
and that's,
and we don't have,

2408
01:58:38,420 --> 01:58:41,380
we haven't priced all of that in to any 
of things,

2409
01:58:41,381 --> 01:58:42,310
whether you're talking about,
you know,

2410
01:58:42,311 --> 01:58:43,720
the,
the chemical industry or,

2411
01:58:43,790 --> 01:58:45,820
or,
or the industry.

2412
01:58:45,850 --> 01:58:46,230
I mean,
we're,

2413
01:58:46,240 --> 01:58:51,240
we're,
we're addicted to the use of these 

2414
01:58:51,240 --> 01:58:53,340
fossil fuels the same way we're addicted
to some people are addicted to the use 

2415
01:58:53,340 --> 01:58:55,330
of cigarettes when the health 
consequences of those things are there,

2416
01:58:55,450 --> 01:58:57,100
they're almost parallel and a lot of 
ways.

2417
01:58:57,150 --> 01:58:58,750
Yeah.
Well and amazingly,

2418
01:58:58,751 --> 01:59:00,180
as you have the same,
I mean,

2419
01:59:00,340 --> 01:59:03,850
I think you turned me onto this 
documentary.

2420
01:59:03,851 --> 01:59:08,851
What was it,
merchants of doubt that the same phds 

2421
01:59:08,851 --> 01:59:09,940
you got like 10 guys who moved from 
India,

2422
01:59:09,980 --> 01:59:14,980
you know,
just toxic industry to toxic industry 

2423
01:59:14,980 --> 01:59:15,620
defending whether it's big tobacco or 
the.

2424
01:59:17,090 --> 01:59:22,090
I'm in the document a,
I interviewed a guy named Fred Singer 

2425
01:59:22,820 --> 01:59:24,900
who was one of these people.
Uh,

2426
01:59:25,040 --> 01:59:29,270
and uh,
he's a climate change denier and there's

2427
01:59:29,330 --> 01:59:30,700
just some,
um,

2428
01:59:30,980 --> 01:59:35,980
it's been awhile that it was,
there were some key moments where I was 

2429
01:59:35,980 --> 01:59:36,290
like listening,
listening for him,

2430
01:59:36,530 --> 01:59:41,180
all the major scientific organizations 
that say that climate change is real and

2431
01:59:41,181 --> 01:59:46,181
that humans are our major contributors 
to it and he basically just refused to 

2432
01:59:46,181 --> 01:59:46,370
accept it.

2433
01:59:47,380 --> 01:59:49,720
Those shows where you have the three 
heads,

2434
01:59:49,721 --> 01:59:52,920
you and then the two experts and they 
yell over each other and then we'll,

2435
01:59:53,300 --> 01:59:58,300
we'll be right back.
And then you go to commercial fucking 

2436
01:59:58,300 --> 02:00:00,361
things on solving anything,
those weird moments where people are 

2437
02:00:00,361 --> 02:00:02,710
yelling at each other and you can't 
figure out who's right or who's wrong.

2438
02:00:02,970 --> 02:00:07,970
I'm not a big fan of that personally.
And I think that especially it was a 

2439
02:00:07,970 --> 02:00:09,980
failure to do that with climate change 
because it,

2440
02:00:10,210 --> 02:00:12,180
it,
it created the doubt,

2441
02:00:12,480 --> 02:00:13,900
it created the doubt.
Um,

2442
02:00:14,070 --> 02:00:19,070
and I think that was a very successful.
It was a very successful strategy.

2443
02:00:20,070 --> 02:00:22,140
But,
but that's intention intention with what

2444
02:00:22,530 --> 02:00:25,530
we just said about the New York Times.
Because if you,

2445
02:00:25,560 --> 02:00:27,840
if you take a position as a journalist,
if you say,

2446
02:00:27,841 --> 02:00:32,841
okay,
actually one side of this conversation 

2447
02:00:32,841 --> 02:00:33,250
is full of Shit,
then you seem like you're not an

2448
02:00:33,700 --> 02:00:35,890
information.
I think it's different to take us a,

2449
02:00:36,010 --> 02:00:37,180
a position.
I don't know.

2450
02:00:37,450 --> 02:00:39,790
It's not controversial for me to sit 
here and say,

2451
02:00:39,791 --> 02:00:40,970
if you smoke cigarettes,
uh,

2452
02:00:41,200 --> 02:00:45,490
the science strongly suggest you have a 
higher odds of lung cancer.

2453
02:00:45,700 --> 02:00:48,730
Same thing with climate change,
but it became politicized.

2454
02:00:48,940 --> 02:00:50,410
So I don't feel.
I don't,

2455
02:00:51,010 --> 02:00:56,010
you'll notice I've stepped out of some 
of the discussions that have been taking

2456
02:00:56,170 --> 02:01:01,170
place because it's not my role as 
journalists to come down on one side or 

2457
02:01:01,170 --> 02:01:01,170
another.
But with climate change,

2458
02:01:01,170 --> 02:01:03,420
I feel absolutely comfortable saying 
this.

2459
02:01:03,460 --> 02:01:04,110
The,
the,

2460
02:01:04,170 --> 02:01:09,170
the,
the vast majority of scientists believe 

2461
02:01:09,170 --> 02:01:10,000
this is real and a big,
big problem.

2462
02:01:10,240 --> 02:01:15,240
So I don't what,
what you're talking about with the New 

2463
02:01:15,240 --> 02:01:18,720
York Times and I don't really.
I'm not going to step out and take a 

2464
02:01:18,720 --> 02:01:18,720
view on it,
but what,

2465
02:01:18,720 --> 02:01:22,230
what I believe you're saying with the 
times is that they were pro Clinton and 

2466
02:01:22,230 --> 02:01:26,101
anti trump.
That's different from having a position 

2467
02:01:26,101 --> 02:01:26,101
on climate change.

2468
02:01:26,101 --> 02:01:26,101
Well,
it's not.

2469
02:01:26,101 --> 02:01:31,091
Well no,
because they have a position on just 

2470
02:01:31,091 --> 02:01:33,610
just take the Lens as climate change.
You have one candidate who's denying the

2471
02:01:34,431 --> 02:01:35,540
reality of climate change.
Where?

2472
02:01:35,541 --> 02:01:38,300
Who's,
who's just claiming that the,

2473
02:01:39,340 --> 02:01:41,930
the Chinese trump?
Well,

2474
02:01:41,931 --> 02:01:42,580
no,
because it was.

2475
02:01:42,620 --> 02:01:45,590
Because when trump says climate change 
is a Chinese hoax,

2476
02:01:46,250 --> 02:01:49,580
you have to call him.
Here we go.

2477
02:01:49,840 --> 02:01:54,840
He said it's a Chinese hoax,
so he should go to China and see those 

2478
02:01:54,840 --> 02:01:58,541
people that are walking around with gas 
masks on because they can't breathe in 

2479
02:01:58,541 --> 02:01:58,541
Beijing.
Okay.

2480
02:01:58,541 --> 02:01:58,541
But that's,
I mean,

2481
02:01:58,541 --> 02:01:59,200
that's,
that's the pollution argument,

2482
02:01:59,220 --> 02:02:04,220
which I think is actually much stronger 
because just you can't go to Beijing and

2483
02:02:04,281 --> 02:02:06,020
say this is how we want the air to be.
Right?

2484
02:02:06,420 --> 02:02:10,250
Uh,
but I think something like 20,

2485
02:02:10,251 --> 02:02:15,251
I think something like 25 percent of the
air pollution in California on some days

2486
02:02:16,740 --> 02:02:17,870
is coming from China.

2487
02:02:18,070 --> 02:02:20,900
Maybe there's some amazing.
I could have that slightly wrong.

2488
02:02:20,901 --> 02:02:22,250
Jamie can check that out,
but please do.

2489
02:02:22,251 --> 02:02:24,160
There's some,
there's some extraordinary amount of air

2490
02:02:24,470 --> 02:02:27,440
air pollution that we get from China.
That's insane.

2491
02:02:27,441 --> 02:02:30,440
I did not know that yet.
Just makes its way across the ocean.

2492
02:02:31,810 --> 02:02:35,850
There's no wall build that wall.
Um,

2493
02:02:36,380 --> 02:02:37,970
but no,
but at a certain point,

2494
02:02:37,971 --> 02:02:42,971
I mean there's some,
there's some level of dishonesty and 

2495
02:02:42,971 --> 02:02:43,760
misinformation that's so egregious that 
if you're a journalist,

2496
02:02:44,120 --> 02:02:49,120
commit at all committed to being an 
unbiased or disinterested broker of 

2497
02:02:50,300 --> 02:02:53,420
information and a conversation.
If you set up a conversation between,

2498
02:02:53,900 --> 02:02:56,090
you know,
the Sean Spicer's of the world or,

2499
02:02:56,091 --> 02:03:01,091
or the Kellyanne Conway's who have their
alternative facts and someone who's 

2500
02:03:01,091 --> 02:03:04,280
honestly talking about whatever it is,
climate change,

2501
02:03:04,720 --> 02:03:07,570
um,
it's very,

2502
02:03:07,580 --> 02:03:09,110
you know,
you can't split that baby,

2503
02:03:09,200 --> 02:03:14,200
but I don't think you have to create 
mock unnecessary debates around climate 

2504
02:03:14,751 --> 02:03:16,250
change.
What I do think is that,

2505
02:03:16,670 --> 02:03:19,190
uh,
with the trump administration,

2506
02:03:19,540 --> 02:03:24,540
uh,
that it is imperative for journal that 

2507
02:03:24,540 --> 02:03:25,510
journalists a call out,
uh,

2508
02:03:25,550 --> 02:03:29,600
when things are said that aren't true,
but that I don't think it's constructive

2509
02:03:29,601 --> 02:03:34,601
for mainstream journalistic 
organizations to have an openly hostile 

2510
02:03:34,601 --> 02:03:39,320
anti trump attitude or pro somebody else
attitude because then you lead.

2511
02:03:39,680 --> 02:03:44,680
That just leads to further polarization.
But when it's exactly what we don't 

2512
02:03:44,680 --> 02:03:44,680
need,

2513
02:03:44,680 --> 02:03:48,660
but you call him out on all the times 
that he said things that were just 

2514
02:03:48,660 --> 02:03:48,660
absolutely not true.
Absolutely.

2515
02:03:48,660 --> 02:03:49,290
It was like you're anti trump.
Yes it can.

2516
02:03:49,620 --> 02:03:51,060
There's no question.
There's no question.

2517
02:03:51,090 --> 02:03:54,170
And I think that's a issue we're dealing
with and I,

2518
02:03:54,200 --> 02:03:59,200
but I think this is a time of real soul 
searching in my industry because I,

2519
02:04:00,180 --> 02:04:05,180
I firmly believe there is a very 
powerful place in a functioning 

2520
02:04:05,180 --> 02:04:07,140
democracy for a press,
for,

2521
02:04:07,220 --> 02:04:10,620
for media that people generally view as 
fair.

2522
02:04:10,910 --> 02:04:15,910
Well,
it's also really highlights the 

2523
02:04:15,910 --> 02:04:17,831
responsibility of getting accurate and 
unbiased information to people because 

2524
02:04:17,831 --> 02:04:19,570
there's not a lot of sources of that 
left.

2525
02:04:20,210 --> 02:04:23,330
Mean when you look at Fox News and 
sometimes you look at CNN,

2526
02:04:23,331 --> 02:04:25,400
sometimes you look at him and Msnbc and 
you're like,

2527
02:04:26,150 --> 02:04:28,250
boy,
how much of this is editorialized?

2528
02:04:28,251 --> 02:04:30,580
How much of this is opinion?
You know it.

2529
02:04:30,860 --> 02:04:35,860
You need unbiased facts and you almost 
need it not delivered by people.

2530
02:04:37,550 --> 02:04:38,160
You know,
the

2531
02:04:38,160 --> 02:04:40,800
problem is when,
when people are delivering the news,

2532
02:04:40,801 --> 02:04:41,410
like I,
I,

2533
02:04:42,030 --> 02:04:43,380
when you talk to someone,
you know,

2534
02:04:43,381 --> 02:04:48,381
they're educated in an ivy league 
university and they speak a certain way,

2535
02:04:48,990 --> 02:04:53,990
they act a certain way.
You almost kinda assume that these 

2536
02:04:53,990 --> 02:04:55,500
intellectual people,
these well read people are going to sort

2537
02:04:55,501 --> 02:04:57,540
of lean towards one way or another.

2538
02:04:58,630 --> 02:05:00,720
I think that there,
there is that issue.

2539
02:05:00,721 --> 02:05:01,360
I,
I,

2540
02:05:01,470 --> 02:05:03,660
I would argue,
and again I know this is self serving,

2541
02:05:03,661 --> 02:05:08,661
but I still believe it,
that the three broadcast networks have 

2542
02:05:08,661 --> 02:05:11,841
actually fared quite well in what is a 
incredibly difficult environment,

2543
02:05:13,321 --> 02:05:18,321
right?
So you don't Count Fox as a broadcast 

2544
02:05:18,321 --> 02:05:18,360
network.
Fox News as a cable network,

2545
02:05:18,620 --> 02:05:19,910
but Fox,
uh,

2546
02:05:20,010 --> 02:05:25,010
but they don't have.
Fox broadcast does not have a news 

2547
02:05:25,010 --> 02:05:25,010
division.
ABC,

2548
02:05:25,010 --> 02:05:25,460
CBS and NBC do

2549
02:05:25,510 --> 02:05:30,400
so just broadcast meaning traditional 
old school signaling the air that nobody

2550
02:05:30,401 --> 02:05:30,910
uses anymore.

2551
02:05:31,150 --> 02:05:36,150
Nobody uses them.
But we will refer to them within the 

2552
02:05:36,150 --> 02:05:36,450
industry as the three broadcast.
And that bizarre though it is,

2553
02:05:36,600 --> 02:05:37,270
it is.
Well,

2554
02:05:37,271 --> 02:05:38,170
some people,
you know,

2555
02:05:38,171 --> 02:05:40,030
they put up their rabbit ears and get 
the signal.

2556
02:05:40,031 --> 02:05:43,030
Fuck those cord cutters,
extreme cord cutters.

2557
02:05:43,060 --> 02:05:48,060
Jv He got was 20 bucks if I get like 30 
channels and it's way better and it 

2558
02:05:48,060 --> 02:05:48,060
works.
There's no lagging,

2559
02:05:48,060 --> 02:05:49,630
there's no buffering.
You do that.

2560
02:05:49,631 --> 02:05:53,230
And then you get like Netflix for Hulu 
and I have sling.

2561
02:05:53,231 --> 02:05:54,810
But when I wanna watch a basketball game
like this,

2562
02:05:54,910 --> 02:05:56,800
the Ncaa basketball tournament last 
night,

2563
02:05:56,860 --> 02:06:00,230
I had to walk through the air at work.
Really good.

2564
02:06:01,390 --> 02:06:02,590
Wow.
Interesting.

2565
02:06:02,640 --> 02:06:06,830
It's like a collection tool.
What's the,

2566
02:06:06,910 --> 02:06:08,760
what's the viewer benefits on a,
um,

2567
02:06:08,830 --> 02:06:11,770
an evening news broadcast.
And I was like 5 million now it's around

2568
02:06:11,890 --> 02:06:12,970
eight or nine.
Yeah.

2569
02:06:13,170 --> 02:06:15,400
So this is a really big number.

2570
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,340
I don't know,
I don't follow all of the,

2571
02:06:18,470 --> 02:06:20,260
uh,
ticks,

2572
02:06:20,350 --> 02:06:22,430
um,
when it comes to the numbers,

2573
02:06:22,431 --> 02:06:27,431
so I can't answer that accurately,
but people have been predicting the 

2574
02:06:27,431 --> 02:06:31,020
demise of network news for decades now.
Every,

2575
02:06:31,050 --> 02:06:33,310
you know,
I've been at ABC news for 17 years.

2576
02:06:33,820 --> 02:06:36,910
I've been reading obituaries all 
throughout that time.

2577
02:06:37,240 --> 02:06:40,660
Eight dollars million a night on each of
the networks is still out.

2578
02:06:40,790 --> 02:06:44,230
That is a gigantic number,
especially in an age of complete,

2579
02:06:44,231 --> 02:06:45,950
you know,
of micro,

2580
02:06:46,010 --> 02:06:51,010
uh,
information of niche broadcasting and 

2581
02:06:51,010 --> 02:06:51,010
uh,
the Internet.

2582
02:06:51,010 --> 02:06:52,390
It's all that.
Here are the numbers right there,

2583
02:06:52,680 --> 02:06:54,890
NBC.
So ABC's in the lead

2584
02:06:55,110 --> 02:06:57,470
ABC is the lead in total viewers.
Uh,

2585
02:06:57,560 --> 02:06:59,900
so and ABC and NBC and this is just one 
week,

2586
02:06:59,901 --> 02:07:03,850
March 27th right around eight.
And then CBS is six point five.

2587
02:07:03,870 --> 02:07:08,870
So gets a lot of people excuse super old
though because it does because that 

2588
02:07:08,870 --> 02:07:09,110
demographic,
absolutely as soon as excused.

2589
02:07:09,140 --> 02:07:09,770
Very,
very old.

2590
02:07:09,840 --> 02:07:10,830
Well,
it's all people.

2591
02:07:10,890 --> 02:07:14,700
That's the majority is people over 54 or
under 25,

2592
02:07:14,701 --> 02:07:18,660
but I don't think that's the case at 25 
to 54.

2593
02:07:18,661 --> 02:07:23,661
ABC as one point.
6 million as opposed to a 8 million 

2594
02:07:23,661 --> 02:07:24,890
total viewers.
NBC,

2595
02:07:24,900 --> 02:07:25,800
seven,
eight,

2596
02:07:25,830 --> 02:07:29,910
seven point 8 million total viewers.
One point 7 million.

2597
02:07:30,010 --> 02:07:32,070
Twenty five to 54.
And then CBS,

2598
02:07:32,071 --> 02:07:35,060
six point $4 million total.
One point $3.

2599
02:07:35,470 --> 02:07:36,730
Twenty five to 54.
It's funny.

2600
02:07:36,731 --> 02:07:39,910
Like after 54.
Fuck you put before 25.

2601
02:07:39,911 --> 02:07:42,730
Fuck.
You concentrate on this one.

2602
02:07:43,300 --> 02:07:45,460
It is what advertisers want.
It's funny,

2603
02:07:45,750 --> 02:07:47,290
the vitality.

2604
02:07:48,900 --> 02:07:49,980
Yeah,
it's gonna be the ads,

2605
02:07:50,010 --> 02:07:52,010
the ads you run.
It's like,

2606
02:07:52,040 --> 02:07:52,440
you know,

2607
02:07:53,110 --> 02:07:58,110
that are anti inflammatory in,
on the morning because in the morning 

2608
02:07:59,261 --> 02:08:00,940
shows where we're also,
it's more,

2609
02:08:00,970 --> 02:08:05,680
it's closer to four or $5 million for 
ABC and NBC and a little less for CPS.

2610
02:08:06,040 --> 02:08:11,040
Uh,
the percentage of that audience that 

2611
02:08:11,040 --> 02:08:12,550
falls within the demo as we call it,
25 to 54 is higher.

2612
02:08:12,551 --> 02:08:17,551
And so the ads are kind of different.
But I guess my point is that you still 

2613
02:08:17,551 --> 02:08:21,241
have a really significant number of 
people if you take the mornings and 

2614
02:08:21,241 --> 02:08:25,681
evenings on these broadcast networks 
that are getting their news from these 

2615
02:08:25,681 --> 02:08:28,771
places,
which just gets back to the 

2616
02:08:28,771 --> 02:08:31,021
polarization,
the polarized media atmosphere you were 

2617
02:08:31,021 --> 02:08:31,530
talking about before.
I think in this atmosphere that the,

2618
02:08:31,600 --> 02:08:34,630
that having the networks be seen to a 
certain extent.

2619
02:08:34,990 --> 02:08:39,990
To the extent possible as above.
The fright actually is important for 

2620
02:08:39,990 --> 02:08:43,441
democracy is Alex Jones get was I think 
40 million a week,

2621
02:08:45,971 --> 02:08:49,180
but they include like a website hits and
they're big number.

2622
02:08:49,240 --> 02:08:54,240
So it's a skewed number.
I've spent some time with him to have 

2623
02:08:54,240 --> 02:08:57,190
you know him very well.
I went down to Boston and I went down to

2624
02:08:57,191 --> 02:08:58,640
Austin and sent.
Yeah,

2625
02:08:58,730 --> 02:08:59,090
yeah,
yeah,

2626
02:08:59,290 --> 02:09:04,290
yeah.
How long a basically spent a day at 

2627
02:09:04,290 --> 02:09:05,650
hanging around his operation.
This was,

2628
02:09:05,710 --> 02:09:10,710
and I would say 2009.
It was a while ago before the 

2629
02:09:10,710 --> 02:09:12,010
monolithic.
Pretty big back then,

2630
02:09:12,011 --> 02:09:13,630
but not what it is now

2631
02:09:14,060 --> 02:09:18,440
in 1999.
Alex Jones and I put on George Bush,

2632
02:09:18,441 --> 02:09:23,300
senior and junior masks and we smoked 
pot out of a bong and then danced around

2633
02:09:23,301 --> 02:09:24,860
the white,
not the White House,

2634
02:09:24,861 --> 02:09:29,861
the capital building in in Texas for a 
standup video that I did.

2635
02:09:30,610 --> 02:09:35,610
Yeah.
I've been friends with that guy since 

2636
02:09:35,610 --> 02:09:35,610
99.
I listened.

2637
02:09:35,610 --> 02:09:39,970
I listened to your recent podcast with,
which was just it'll dimensional child 

2638
02:09:39,970 --> 02:09:42,170
molesters that are infiltrating our 
airwaves.

2639
02:09:42,520 --> 02:09:42,800
Yeah,
he,

2640
02:09:42,820 --> 02:09:45,620
he went deep.
We got them high and drunk and he went.

2641
02:09:45,621 --> 02:09:50,621
It's amazing.
He went as deep as he's ever gotten 

2642
02:09:50,621 --> 02:09:50,621
before.

2643
02:09:50,621 --> 02:09:51,400
Do you find that he is different when 
he's not being recorded?

2644
02:09:51,850 --> 02:09:53,050
Uh,
yeah.

2645
02:09:53,110 --> 02:09:54,610
Are there,
is there,

2646
02:09:54,611 --> 02:09:56,290
is screaming and yelling.

2647
02:10:02,920 --> 02:10:04,370
That's him singing,
by the way.

2648
02:10:14,040 --> 02:10:14,660
No,
it's the.

2649
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:18,240
He made up these lyrics.
This song is all him.

2650
02:10:18,330 --> 02:10:20,910
I believe he might've ad libbed it to 
give us.

2651
02:10:20,911 --> 02:10:21,900
Give me some volume on this.

2652
02:10:22,870 --> 02:10:27,240
Oh,
that was the name of my dvds,

2653
02:10:27,340 --> 02:10:29,530
belly of the beast from Austin,
Texas.

2654
02:10:29,860 --> 02:10:34,860
Strap yourselves.
That's Alex.

2655
02:10:39,870 --> 02:10:41,690
he's so crazy.
I mean,

2656
02:10:41,691 --> 02:10:43,710
he's definitely different when he's not 
being recorded,

2657
02:10:43,711 --> 02:10:45,220
but he is that guy,
you know,

2658
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,750
he believes it's sincere.
People leaves all this stuff.

2659
02:10:51,510 --> 02:10:52,930
He believes a lot of it.
I mean,

2660
02:10:53,490 --> 02:10:58,490
whether it's correct or not,
that's a different argument whether or 

2661
02:10:58,490 --> 02:10:58,490
not he believes it.

2662
02:10:58,490 --> 02:11:02,120
I was struck and we had,
I spent a full day with them and then we

2663
02:11:02,121 --> 02:11:04,400
had dinner with him afterwards who were 
not recorded.

2664
02:11:04,430 --> 02:11:09,430
And uh,
I was struck by the difference in 

2665
02:11:09,430 --> 02:11:09,740
demeanor,
uh,

2666
02:11:09,950 --> 02:11:11,610
off camera and not being rent.

2667
02:11:11,850 --> 02:11:12,720
Yeah,
there's definitely that.

2668
02:11:12,721 --> 02:11:13,540
I mean,
not saying that,

2669
02:11:13,930 --> 02:11:15,130
leave it.
I don't know.

2670
02:11:15,470 --> 02:11:16,540
I'm not gonna.
I can't,

2671
02:11:16,600 --> 02:11:16,910
I'm not sure.

2672
02:11:17,010 --> 02:11:20,940
He's a showman for sure.
What's really disturbing is when he gets

2673
02:11:20,941 --> 02:11:22,470
stuff right.
You know,

2674
02:11:22,471 --> 02:11:24,810
like the World Trade Organization is a 
perfect example.

2675
02:11:24,811 --> 02:11:29,550
He was one of the ones that highlighted 
the use of a agent provocateurs now what

2676
02:11:29,551 --> 02:11:31,770
agency,
who hires these people,

2677
02:11:32,100 --> 02:11:34,290
but what they do is they take something 
like the WTO,

2678
02:11:34,291 --> 02:11:39,291
which was a big embarrassment that 
people were protesting the WTO and they 

2679
02:11:39,601 --> 02:11:43,080
hire people to turn this peaceful 
protest into a violent protest,

2680
02:11:43,081 --> 02:11:44,820
so these people come in,
they were ski masks,

2681
02:11:44,970 --> 02:11:49,970
they break windows and they light things
on fire or do whatever they do that 

2682
02:11:49,970 --> 02:11:52,980
makes it violent and then they have the 
cops come in and break it up because now

2683
02:11:52,981 --> 02:11:57,981
it's no longer a peaceful protest and so
it got to the point where people were 

2684
02:11:57,981 --> 02:12:01,130
trying to show up for work.
They had WTO Pinzon that aligned through

2685
02:12:01,131 --> 02:12:01,350
it well.

2686
02:12:01,350 --> 02:12:06,350
They had created a no protest zone and 
they were taking his on footage on the 

2687
02:12:06,350 --> 02:12:07,050
news.
They were telling people,

2688
02:12:07,051 --> 02:12:10,800
you have to take the pin off.
You can't go through this area where you

2689
02:12:10,801 --> 02:12:15,750
work with a WTO pin on your backpack or 
on your jacket.

2690
02:12:16,500 --> 02:12:17,790
I mean,
that's crazy,

2691
02:12:18,060 --> 02:12:23,060
and he highlighted that and made a in 
that use of agent provocateurs has been 

2692
02:12:23,911 --> 02:12:28,911
documented.
This is a real thing and it's a real 

2693
02:12:28,911 --> 02:12:29,280
tactic that again,
what agency,

2694
02:12:29,281 --> 02:12:34,281
what,
what faction of the military would 

2695
02:12:34,281 --> 02:12:34,281
fashion the government hires these 
people to do that I don't know,

2696
02:12:34,281 --> 02:12:38,630
but it is a real thing and I did not 
know about that until Alex highlighted 

2697
02:12:38,630 --> 02:12:39,780
it on one of his V,
one in one of his videos.

2698
02:12:40,290 --> 02:12:45,290
It's been proven.
It's been proven that it's real and so 

2699
02:12:45,290 --> 02:12:46,980
that alone is disturbing when you stop 
and think about all the different things

2700
02:12:46,981 --> 02:12:48,480
that he's informed.

2701
02:12:48,480 --> 02:12:52,290
People of that turned out were real like
operation northwoods when the freedom of

2702
02:12:52,291 --> 02:12:57,291
Information Act came out with the 
operation northwoods document where the 

2703
02:12:57,291 --> 02:12:59,730
Joint Chiefs of staff at sign this and 
this was something that they were really

2704
02:12:59,731 --> 02:13:04,731
trying to implement.
They were going to arm Cuban friendlies 

2705
02:13:04,731 --> 02:13:04,731
and have them attack,
wanted them obey.

2706
02:13:04,731 --> 02:13:06,460
They were going to blow up a drone 
jetliner.

2707
02:13:06,480 --> 02:13:11,480
They're going to blame it on the Cubans 
and they were trying to use this as 

2708
02:13:11,480 --> 02:13:11,480
impetus to get us to go to war with 
Cuba.

2709
02:13:11,480 --> 02:13:16,000
You have,
but how do you feel about the things 

2710
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:16,000
that he's talking about that are well,
okay,

2711
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:16,380
but let's talk about that first.
I mean,

2712
02:13:16,470 --> 02:13:20,340
there are things that are true.
That's what gets really squirrely.

2713
02:13:20,520 --> 02:13:25,520
What gets really squirrel.
He's like when when you find out that 

2714
02:13:25,520 --> 02:13:26,940
there have been things like the Gulf of 
Tonkin incident,

2715
02:13:27,230 --> 02:13:32,230
like there's many things that have 
happened where there have been false 

2716
02:13:32,230 --> 02:13:32,230
where the government

2717
02:13:32,230 --> 02:13:37,220
has conspired to lie to the American 
people and people have died because of 

2718
02:13:37,220 --> 02:13:38,880
it I think will.
I don't know a lot about Gulf of Tonkin,

2719
02:13:38,881 --> 02:13:42,930
but although I know more about it than 
than those other examples.

2720
02:13:43,620 --> 02:13:48,620
I mean there are definitely cases where 
it's an additional interpretation to say

2721
02:13:50,641 --> 02:13:53,910
that the government lied to take even 
something that's closer to hand.

2722
02:13:53,911 --> 02:13:58,320
Like we have weapons of mass destruction
as a pretext to go into Iraq right now.

2723
02:13:59,460 --> 02:14:04,460
It's one thing to say that people 
knowingly lied about that Bush and 

2724
02:14:04,741 --> 02:14:09,741
Cheney knowingly lied to the American 
people about that or they were misled by

2725
02:14:10,141 --> 02:14:14,070
people who are knowingly lying or just 
everyone got it wrong.

2726
02:14:14,540 --> 02:14:15,480
Yeah.
Like it was just.

2727
02:14:15,481 --> 02:14:18,060
It was.
It was totally plausible to everyone who

2728
02:14:18,061 --> 02:14:23,061
was informed that he had a WMD program 
and they misinterpreted whatever 

2729
02:14:24,061 --> 02:14:26,430
evidence they thought they had and they 
were just wrong.

2730
02:14:26,460 --> 02:14:28,200
Now.
So that's a spectrum.

2731
02:14:29,090 --> 02:14:30,780
I'm not claiming to know which one of 
those is true.

2732
02:14:30,781 --> 02:14:35,781
I think it's probably probably the last 
is much closer to the truth and that 

2733
02:14:35,911 --> 02:14:38,470
explains many of these instances.
But the,

2734
02:14:38,480 --> 02:14:43,480
the,
I mean that was so corrosive about pure 

2735
02:14:43,480 --> 02:14:44,160
examples of line,
um,

2736
02:14:44,370 --> 02:14:46,170
is that,
uh,

2737
02:14:46,171 --> 02:14:48,750
and we may have one case now this just 
emerging in the news.

2738
02:14:48,760 --> 02:14:51,230
I don't know if the,
maybe the,

2739
02:14:51,231 --> 02:14:52,920
the,
the story has been clarified while we've

2740
02:14:52,921 --> 02:14:57,921
been talking,
but this is now seems that Susan Rice 

2741
02:14:57,921 --> 02:15:02,210
came out at one point,
she said she knew nothing about the 

2742
02:15:02,210 --> 02:15:05,691
unmasking of,
of trump associates in this recent 

2743
02:15:05,691 --> 02:15:10,480
surveillance case.
And now it seems that she is claiming 

2744
02:15:10,480 --> 02:15:12,540
that she actually asked to have certain 
names,

2745
02:15:12,541 --> 02:15:16,350
unmasked and stuff like this.
This is being seized upon again,

2746
02:15:16,410 --> 02:15:20,000
just in the last few hours as an 
example,

2747
02:15:20,001 --> 02:15:21,780
an example of a lie.

2748
02:15:22,020 --> 02:15:24,480
Right?
Which seems very sinister.

2749
02:15:24,900 --> 02:15:29,040
I'm at,
but as though it equalizes the two sides

2750
02:15:29,041 --> 02:15:29,430
here,
right?

2751
02:15:29,431 --> 02:15:30,900
Let's low.
So let's say worst case scenario,

2752
02:15:30,930 --> 02:15:35,010
Susan Rice lied about having some 
knowledge of this investigation.

2753
02:15:35,330 --> 02:15:37,170
Um,
that doesn't.

2754
02:15:37,270 --> 02:15:40,320
It says something bad about Susan Rice.
It says something.

2755
02:15:40,340 --> 02:15:42,060
I mean,
she has to deal with the consequences of

2756
02:15:42,061 --> 02:15:45,480
that lie,
but it doesn't exonerate all of the line

2757
02:15:45,481 --> 02:15:47,520
that trump has done about everything 
under the sun.

2758
02:15:47,521 --> 02:15:52,521
Right?
So w what so destabilizing here is at 

2759
02:15:52,521 --> 02:15:56,010
the moment,
the moment ms dot even true of honest 

2760
02:15:56,010 --> 02:15:57,750
errors,
the moment that a news organization like

2761
02:15:57,751 --> 02:16:02,751
yours or the New York Times commits an 
honest error that it gets pointed to 

2762
02:16:03,900 --> 02:16:08,900
from those who want to treat the 
mainstream news media as fake news as 

2763
02:16:08,900 --> 02:16:10,260
see everything's the same.
Like,

2764
02:16:10,261 --> 02:16:10,660
like,
like,

2765
02:16:11,100 --> 02:16:16,100
like you're no better than than somebody
who's just manufacturing fake news on a 

2766
02:16:16,141 --> 02:16:18,390
laptop in his basement.

2767
02:16:18,670 --> 02:16:20,480
Um,
so it's,

2768
02:16:20,620 --> 02:16:21,630
it's,
and,

2769
02:16:21,650 --> 02:16:24,780
and the flip side of that is when Alex 
Jones get something right,

2770
02:16:25,080 --> 02:16:29,100
it seems to,
it seems to make him look like a,

2771
02:16:29,470 --> 02:16:34,470
a dignified journalistic enterprise 
analogous to the New York Times or to 

2772
02:16:34,470 --> 02:16:36,910
ABC News.
And neither of those things are true.

2773
02:16:36,911 --> 02:16:41,911
I mean,
there are small lies and then they're a 

2774
02:16:41,911 --> 02:16:41,911
huge lives.
There are honest mistakes,

2775
02:16:41,911 --> 02:16:46,760
but be committed by totally reputable 
organizations that are really trying to 

2776
02:16:46,760 --> 02:16:49,650
get their facts straight.
And then there are malicious that's just

2777
02:16:49,660 --> 02:16:54,660
militia malicious propaganda outlets 
that are not at all trying to get their 

2778
02:16:54,660 --> 02:16:58,651
facts straight and trying to engineer 
everyone's credulity and ignorance into 

2779
02:16:58,651 --> 02:17:00,810
something that is just purely a matter 
of,

2780
02:17:01,350 --> 02:17:01,850
of,
uh,

2781
02:17:01,880 --> 02:17:03,100
you know,
tribal,

2782
02:17:03,230 --> 02:17:04,680
a sentiment,
you know.

2783
02:17:04,720 --> 02:17:09,720
And um,
so we lose our ability to distinguish 

2784
02:17:09,720 --> 02:17:10,570
these different projects when we say,
oh look,

2785
02:17:10,870 --> 02:17:12,400
you know,
fake news.

2786
02:17:12,580 --> 02:17:15,790
It both sides do it.
Or here's a lie.

2787
02:17:15,791 --> 02:17:20,791
Here's Susan Rice's one lie that she 
told in the last 10 years maybe in got 

2788
02:17:20,791 --> 02:17:24,661
caught for.
And we have a president who lies every 

2789
02:17:24,661 --> 02:17:25,470
time he picks up his approaches a mike 
or,

2790
02:17:25,480 --> 02:17:26,410
or picks up his twitter.

2791
02:17:26,460 --> 02:17:28,440
She had other problems because she had 
gone on,

2792
02:17:28,441 --> 02:17:33,441
I believe,
on the Sunday morning talk shows after 

2793
02:17:33,441 --> 02:17:34,260
Ben Gazi with some talking points.
Yes.

2794
02:17:34,320 --> 02:17:35,040
Yeah.
No,

2795
02:17:35,070 --> 02:17:37,990
soon as Susan look like she was itching 
to get caught.

2796
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:39,150
I mean,
whether this was a case of.

2797
02:17:41,100 --> 02:17:42,090
Yeah.
Uh,

2798
02:17:42,210 --> 02:17:42,700
no,
I,

2799
02:17:42,701 --> 02:17:46,440
I think your point is very,
very important because I think that when

2800
02:17:46,441 --> 02:17:47,640
you have,
um,

2801
02:17:48,510 --> 02:17:50,400
if you have one side that lies all the 
time,

2802
02:17:50,610 --> 02:17:52,770
it's imperative that the other side 
don't lie at all.

2803
02:17:52,860 --> 02:17:53,910
Yeah,
yeah.

2804
02:17:53,980 --> 02:17:55,710
Oh.
And in the line and say,

2805
02:17:55,711 --> 02:17:56,520
look,
everybody does this.

2806
02:17:56,521 --> 02:18:01,521
Why it's a tense time for people in my 
line of work because we were so much 

2807
02:18:02,311 --> 02:18:06,060
scrutiny and then we get it wrong.
We really,

2808
02:18:06,390 --> 02:18:08,100
you know,
we take a lot of heat,

2809
02:18:08,400 --> 02:18:11,880
but when we get it wrong,
I think we're pretty quick to say we got

2810
02:18:11,881 --> 02:18:13,530
it wrong.
Here's the actual.

2811
02:18:13,560 --> 02:18:15,150
Here's the truth.
Do you know the Donald trump

2812
02:18:15,150 --> 02:18:18,810
junior said that cernovich get a 
pulitzer for exposing Susan Rice.

2813
02:18:19,140 --> 02:18:19,770
Really?
Yeah.

2814
02:18:20,100 --> 02:18:20,850
Right.
Yeah,

2815
02:18:20,900 --> 02:18:22,100
it's a bit.
But that's it.

2816
02:18:22,620 --> 02:18:27,620
That's why this drives me a little crazy
because it is not cernovich is the fact 

2817
02:18:27,620 --> 02:18:28,370
that,
that this is

2818
02:18:30,050 --> 02:18:35,050
why did you lead them down the Cernovich
that you just gave them right back into 

2819
02:18:35,050 --> 02:18:38,310
its yard in front of the kit.
And we're only now discovering the 

2820
02:18:39,401 --> 02:18:42,610
consequences of this.
Let's come back in five years,

2821
02:18:42,650 --> 02:18:47,650
see if,
if we're talking about anything that 

2822
02:18:47,650 --> 02:18:47,650
makes any sense.
Well,

2823
02:18:47,650 --> 02:18:49,130
it's all very blurry.
It,

2824
02:18:49,160 --> 02:18:52,390
it really is very blurred because we've 
never had a situation like this where we

2825
02:18:52,391 --> 02:18:56,410
have a president that people just don't 
trust to be honest.

2826
02:18:56,411 --> 02:19:01,411
And when someone would,
if someone lied about anything in the 

2827
02:19:01,411 --> 02:19:01,411
past,
I mean if Donald Trump got caught having

2828
02:19:01,411 --> 02:19:04,210
his dick sucked in the White House to my
on film and you know,

2829
02:19:04,211 --> 02:19:04,900
he built like,
look,

2830
02:19:04,901 --> 02:19:08,530
I made a mistake when he wouldn't be,
nothing would be nothing.

2831
02:19:08,680 --> 02:19:12,100
Photoshop did that fake news.
Just again,

2832
02:19:12,101 --> 02:19:17,101
just slot to use Joseph Goldstein's 
phrase before about slotting into 

2833
02:19:17,101 --> 02:19:19,780
geological time and just looking at the 
broader scope of history,

2834
02:19:19,781 --> 02:19:21,880
you know,
we've had really,

2835
02:19:22,300 --> 02:19:25,960
we've had periods of time where we had 
media than the muck rakers,

2836
02:19:25,961 --> 02:19:28,220
you know,
where the media outlets

2837
02:19:28,220 --> 02:19:31,310
were.
Didn't even pretend at times to,

2838
02:19:31,370 --> 02:19:32,510
to,
um,

2839
02:19:33,230 --> 02:19:36,170
to not have an agenda.
Items where those.

2840
02:19:36,860 --> 02:19:41,860
And the early parts of our republic 
where we had was a teddy Roosevelt 

2841
02:19:42,951 --> 02:19:45,320
called the journalists muck rakers 
where,

2842
02:19:45,321 --> 02:19:47,150
um,
they basically,

2843
02:19:47,151 --> 02:19:49,100
he was saying that their job was to 
write muck,

2844
02:19:49,101 --> 02:19:53,630
uh,
to be working in filth and uh,

2845
02:19:54,760 --> 02:19:59,410
the media and American politics have 
been filled with instances,

2846
02:19:59,540 --> 02:20:04,540
American media and American politics had
been filled with instances over our 

2847
02:20:04,540 --> 02:20:08,160
short history of a untruths and agendas.
And,

2848
02:20:09,100 --> 02:20:14,100
uh,
then we have times of relative 

2849
02:20:14,100 --> 02:20:15,931
stability.
And then sometimes we slide back into 

2850
02:20:15,931 --> 02:20:18,400
more tumultuous times.
I think maybe the Pollyanna here,

2851
02:20:18,401 --> 02:20:23,401
but I think that we,
the republic will survive and that we 

2852
02:20:23,401 --> 02:20:27,061
will.
It doesn't inexorably lead to a time 

2853
02:20:27,061 --> 02:20:27,061
where truth doesn't matter.

2854
02:20:27,430 --> 02:20:32,430
Well,
it seems to open up the door for a 

2855
02:20:32,430 --> 02:20:35,551
viable alternative seems to open up the 
door for someone who comes along who is 

2856
02:20:35,551 --> 02:20:38,550
in many ways bulletproof.
It is a very ethical.

2857
02:20:38,600 --> 02:20:39,610
It's opened a door.
I mean,

2858
02:20:39,611 --> 02:20:42,630
now anyone talking to somebody to run 
for office.

2859
02:20:42,670 --> 02:20:43,510
Yes.
I,

2860
02:20:43,760 --> 02:20:45,820
I just don't think anybody's bulletproof
humans.

2861
02:20:46,090 --> 02:20:48,160
Humans.
I mean with the exception of Joe Rogan,

2862
02:20:48,420 --> 02:20:50,710
but definitely not bulletproof.
You don't have to be bulletproof.

2863
02:20:50,770 --> 02:20:55,770
I mean,
this guy has got nothing but bullet 

2864
02:20:55,770 --> 02:20:56,380
holes in him when he's president.
What Joe was saying is it opens the door

2865
02:20:56,381 --> 02:21:01,381
to somebody who's on a strong,
viable alternative for someone who is 

2866
02:21:01,381 --> 02:21:03,890
ethical seminar.
His door is open to anyone who,

2867
02:21:04,030 --> 02:21:05,670
who couldn't be president at this point.
I mean,

2868
02:21:05,690 --> 02:21:07,660
there's no one that steps forward right 
now.

2869
02:21:07,661 --> 02:21:08,380
I mean is,
it doesn't.

2870
02:21:08,500 --> 02:21:10,920
Do you think they're waiting?
I mean like who?

2871
02:21:11,230 --> 02:21:14,200
First of all it will say you couldn't be
president.

2872
02:21:14,201 --> 02:21:16,680
There was never.
Has never been an atheist.

2873
02:21:16,681 --> 02:21:18,850
They would attach your twitter page.
First of all,

2874
02:21:19,720 --> 02:21:21,160
good luck.
They would hire him.

2875
02:21:21,770 --> 02:21:22,490
No,
I mean I think,

2876
02:21:22,710 --> 02:21:27,710
you know,
if you're going to use a conventional 

2877
02:21:27,710 --> 02:21:27,710
political calculus,
well then yeah.

2878
02:21:27,710 --> 02:21:32,021
Then you know,
an atheist be an atheist to having a 

2879
02:21:32,021 --> 02:21:34,880
history of psychedelic drug use,
having edgy positions.

2880
02:21:34,881 --> 02:21:35,860
That alienates,
you know,

2881
02:21:35,870 --> 02:21:39,170
massive a constituent constituencies I,
but all of that.

2882
02:21:39,230 --> 02:21:41,210
A deal breaker.
But I could,

2883
02:21:41,270 --> 02:21:46,270
you would never have predicted that 
someone this scandalous and inept and 

2884
02:21:48,051 --> 02:21:51,620
dishonest and provably so at every.
I mean he can't.

2885
02:21:51,621 --> 02:21:56,621
He literally can't get through an hour 
of the day without something that would 

2886
02:21:56,621 --> 02:21:59,080
have been a scandal in some previous age
of the earth coming out of his,

2887
02:21:59,610 --> 02:22:01,360
his mouth.
Um,

2888
02:22:02,480 --> 02:22:04,070
it's just,
it's,

2889
02:22:04,370 --> 02:22:05,060
I think,
yeah,

2890
02:22:05,061 --> 02:22:10,061
I think,
I think there's no predicting who could 

2891
02:22:10,061 --> 02:22:11,560
be a president in the future mean it's,
it's,

2892
02:22:11,720 --> 02:22:16,490
it's you need a,
you need wealth and you need charisma on

2893
02:22:16,491 --> 02:22:17,300
some level.
You need to,

2894
02:22:17,301 --> 02:22:20,330
you need to be able to,
to get a tribe behind you.

2895
02:22:20,960 --> 02:22:25,960
Um,
but I don't think you need any of what 

2896
02:22:25,960 --> 02:22:26,220
people thought you needed even a year 
ago.

2897
02:22:26,640 --> 02:22:31,640
Well,
what he's done by circumventing the 

2898
02:22:31,640 --> 02:22:34,500
whole system and bay being independently
wealthy is really kinda.

2899
02:22:34,530 --> 02:22:39,530
But even that was a jam.
I mean that was amazing is that he is 

2900
02:22:39,530 --> 02:22:42,681
like,
I don't know how much money he actually 

2901
02:22:42,681 --> 02:22:44,481
put into his campaign,
but it's just not nearly what you would 

2902
02:22:44,481 --> 02:22:44,481
have.
What you.

2903
02:22:44,481 --> 02:22:48,051
I mean he really only had to pretend to 
be that wealthy and it was incredible.

2904
02:22:48,091 --> 02:22:48,450
What happened.

2905
02:22:48,580 --> 02:22:53,580
Like is what he achieved with very 
little campaign funds and you know what 

2906
02:22:55,470 --> 02:22:56,840
I mean,
you as a,

2907
02:22:56,850 --> 02:22:59,270
he,
it's like them or not,

2908
02:22:59,300 --> 02:23:04,300
you have to give him credit for an 
unbelievable victory that very few 

2909
02:23:04,300 --> 02:23:05,060
people saw it coming.
It's a popularity contest.

2910
02:23:05,150 --> 02:23:10,150
Isn't that part of the problem as you 
made a popular person president of a 

2911
02:23:10,150 --> 02:23:11,320
popularity contest?
I mean,

2912
02:23:11,330 --> 02:23:12,070
that's what it is.
He was,

2913
02:23:12,350 --> 02:23:14,500
he was running against somebody who 
wasn't popular.

2914
02:23:14,520 --> 02:23:17,120
So that's it.
Let's put it in context.

2915
02:23:17,520 --> 02:23:22,520
We're always coming after eight years of
a Democratic president who was 

2916
02:23:22,520 --> 02:23:26,291
controversial in many ways.
And it's always harder for somebody at 

2917
02:23:26,291 --> 02:23:30,101
the same party to run.
So there are a lot of dynamics large or 

2918
02:23:30,101 --> 02:23:31,490
impersonal dynamics that were working in
his favor.

2919
02:23:32,120 --> 02:23:32,990
Yeah.
It's just.

2920
02:23:33,850 --> 02:23:36,310
But when we get back to the argument 
about like,

2921
02:23:36,560 --> 02:23:39,020
are we in apocalyptic times or whatever,
I guess,

2922
02:23:39,050 --> 02:23:40,640
and I mean,
I don't know anything,

2923
02:23:40,641 --> 02:23:41,050
I,
I,

2924
02:23:41,570 --> 02:23:45,200
but my instinct is just as a country,
we've,

2925
02:23:45,460 --> 02:23:48,020
we've seen times have much worse 
division.

2926
02:23:48,200 --> 02:23:50,510
We had a civil war.
Um,

2927
02:23:51,320 --> 02:23:54,470
it's telling that you have to go back 
there for,

2928
02:23:54,980 --> 02:23:56,420
for a compelling example,

2929
02:23:57,120 --> 02:23:59,260
this would've been the sixties.
Yeah.

2930
02:23:59,780 --> 02:24:01,730
People in the streets.
We had the weather underground.

2931
02:24:01,731 --> 02:24:02,590
We had to,
you know,

2932
02:24:02,620 --> 02:24:07,620
we was pretty to what we had.
We had mlk and rfk assassinated right at

2933
02:24:09,900 --> 02:24:10,280
time.

2934
02:24:10,350 --> 02:24:15,350
Yeah.
What I'm worried about now is I think 

2935
02:24:15,631 --> 02:24:19,130
he's truly unique and I think,
I think the,

2936
02:24:19,810 --> 02:24:24,810
the way we're becoming unmoored from 
kind of the ordinary truth testing in 

2937
02:24:27,031 --> 02:24:30,810
politics I think is unique.
I mean the fact that we have a president

2938
02:24:30,811 --> 02:24:34,680
who seen it because there's a whole 
feedback mechanism and maybe trump seems

2939
02:24:34,681 --> 02:24:39,681
to get some of his information from info
wars and from places like info wars at 

2940
02:24:40,221 --> 02:24:40,270
all.

2941
02:24:40,910 --> 02:24:43,360
Yeah.
I don't think he pays a price for,

2942
02:24:43,361 --> 02:24:44,710
for his,
his,

2943
02:24:45,300 --> 02:24:48,310
his,
his popularity rating is not high.

2944
02:24:48,450 --> 02:24:48,820
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

2945
02:24:49,270 --> 02:24:50,640
He's,
he's paying some price.

2946
02:24:50,641 --> 02:24:55,641
But the question is,
is it going to be enough and what 

2947
02:24:55,641 --> 02:24:56,190
happens within the next terrorist 
attack?

2948
02:24:56,191 --> 02:24:56,510
Right.
I mean,

2949
02:24:56,540 --> 02:25:01,540
so,
so the real fear is that if we have a 

2950
02:25:01,540 --> 02:25:02,520
rush dog fire kind of moment,
right,

2951
02:25:03,450 --> 02:25:05,610
engineered by him or not.
I mean,

2952
02:25:05,611 --> 02:25:08,760
I'm not so paranoid as to think he's 
going to do it,

2953
02:25:08,790 --> 02:25:11,940
but I just think it's inevitable.
Something that's going to happen.

2954
02:25:11,941 --> 02:25:12,250
I mean,
we've,

2955
02:25:12,280 --> 02:25:14,520
we've had a,
we've had 80 days,

2956
02:25:14,521 --> 02:25:19,521
100 days,
whatever it's been of his presidency 

2957
02:25:19,521 --> 02:25:20,760
were basically nothing has happened and 
it's been pure chaos,

2958
02:25:20,820 --> 02:25:25,820
right?
And the work of governments not getting 

2959
02:25:25,820 --> 02:25:27,100
done.
The government's barely even staffed and

2960
02:25:27,340 --> 02:25:30,910
this has been a period of work.
Nothing really has happened,

2961
02:25:30,940 --> 02:25:35,940
but imagine a nine slash 11 size event 
or something really goes off the rails 

2962
02:25:36,911 --> 02:25:39,010
with North Korea or China or Russia.

2963
02:25:39,570 --> 02:25:42,700
Uh,
it will be so.

2964
02:25:42,790 --> 02:25:43,050
I mean,
the,

2965
02:25:43,060 --> 02:25:48,060
the pressure when the pressure to 
normalize him as commander in chief will

2966
02:25:49,121 --> 02:25:54,121
be much greater than it is now.
And already everyone's feeling that 

2967
02:25:54,121 --> 02:25:54,280
pressure,
um,

2968
02:25:54,730 --> 02:25:55,600
but to the,
the,

2969
02:25:55,670 --> 02:26:00,670
the,
the ability to clamp down on civil 

2970
02:26:00,670 --> 02:26:02,130
liberties and um,
uh,

2971
02:26:02,170 --> 02:26:03,850
just,
uh,

2972
02:26:04,780 --> 02:26:07,180
use the power of the presidency in a way
that,

2973
02:26:07,290 --> 02:26:10,480
that will be very difficult for,
um,

2974
02:26:11,170 --> 02:26:13,240
our society to recover from.
I think it's just,

2975
02:26:13,241 --> 02:26:13,870
I mean,
I think the,

2976
02:26:14,030 --> 02:26:17,350
it's,
it's a scary moment and I'm,

2977
02:26:17,620 --> 02:26:18,070
I mean,
I,

2978
02:26:18,160 --> 02:26:23,160
I the,
the people who are drawn analogies 

2979
02:26:23,160 --> 02:26:24,800
between him and,
you know,

2980
02:26:24,820 --> 02:26:26,560
the thirties in,
in,

2981
02:26:27,300 --> 02:26:29,560
um,
Germany.

2982
02:26:29,770 --> 02:26:31,200
Um,
I mean,

2983
02:26:31,400 --> 02:26:35,290
I think those analogies are misleading 
in ways,

2984
02:26:35,320 --> 02:26:40,320
but again,
you just don't know how strange things 

2985
02:26:40,320 --> 02:26:44,020
could get in with a big negative 
stimulus to the system with what I think

2986
02:26:44,021 --> 02:26:49,021
we know is that we have someone in 
charge who is a malignantly selfish 

2987
02:26:52,030 --> 02:26:52,660
conman.

2988
02:26:52,990 --> 02:26:54,850
Right?
I think that is an objective fact.

2989
02:26:54,851 --> 02:26:57,130
That's not a partisan thing to say he 
is.

2990
02:26:57,530 --> 02:27:02,530
I mean,
that's as obvious about him as his hair 

2991
02:27:02,530 --> 02:27:06,540
and to have that much power in the hands
of somebody who is that,

2992
02:27:07,390 --> 02:27:12,160
whose,
whose ethical compass is that unreliable

2993
02:27:12,161 --> 02:27:14,860
or reliably bad in my view?
And I got,

2994
02:27:14,870 --> 02:27:17,470
I wouldn't say this if pence who scares 
me for other reasons.

2995
02:27:17,471 --> 02:27:20,930
I mean he's a theocrat.
I wouldn't say this of,

2996
02:27:21,040 --> 02:27:24,160
of most Republicans who I might disagree
with,

2997
02:27:24,640 --> 02:27:29,640
but there's just something.
But to put that much power in the hands 

2998
02:27:29,640 --> 02:27:29,880
of somebody who,
um,

2999
02:27:30,790 --> 02:27:35,790
is so disconnected from facts and a and 
reasonable concern for the wellbeing of,

3000
02:27:36,920 --> 02:27:39,790
of the rest of humanity and the future.
And I mean it's just,

3001
02:27:40,450 --> 02:27:45,450
it's,
it's an incredible moment and I don't 

3002
02:27:45,450 --> 02:27:47,440
think we've ever had a president who you
could look at and say that about.

3003
02:27:47,441 --> 02:27:48,700
So clearly.
I mean,

3004
02:27:48,701 --> 02:27:52,810
not even Nixon,
Nixon was pathological in other ways,

3005
02:27:52,811 --> 02:27:57,811
but you know,
Nixon Nixon was given us the clean air 

3006
02:27:57,811 --> 02:27:57,811
act,
right.

3007
02:27:57,811 --> 02:28:01,261
I mean,
Nixon had some point of contact with 

3008
02:28:01,261 --> 02:28:03,580
terrestrial reality which wasn't just 
about figuring out how to,

3009
02:28:03,670 --> 02:28:07,510
how to burnish his,
his imaginary grander,

3010
02:28:08,380 --> 02:28:09,210
you know.
Um,

3011
02:28:09,820 --> 02:28:11,650
so yeah,
I mean,

3012
02:28:11,651 --> 02:28:14,930
I,
I mean,

3013
02:28:15,360 --> 02:28:20,360
I think we're one huge news story away 
from finding out how bad a president he 

3014
02:28:20,411 --> 02:28:22,040
could be and think.
I think that's.

3015
02:28:23,160 --> 02:28:24,190
No,
I think

3016
02:28:24,840 --> 02:28:29,840
he could surprise that he could surprise
even the people who are very 

3017
02:28:29,840 --> 02:28:29,840
pessimistic.
Well,

3018
02:28:29,840 --> 02:28:29,840
he could also rise to the occasion.

3019
02:28:30,590 --> 02:28:31,270
Yeah.
Yeah,

3020
02:28:31,990 --> 02:28:35,350
I see that.
Well,

3021
02:28:35,360 --> 02:28:40,360
no,
I mean also like to know how I would be 

3022
02:28:40,360 --> 02:28:41,460
the first to give him or the system the 
credit for that.

3023
02:28:41,461 --> 02:28:42,290
I mean it's like,
it's like,

3024
02:28:42,330 --> 02:28:43,810
it's not that I,
I,

3025
02:28:44,040 --> 02:28:49,040
if he starts doing something good like 
let's say a massive infrastructure 

3026
02:28:49,040 --> 02:28:49,140
project,
right.

3027
02:28:49,141 --> 02:28:53,100
That includes building out good things,
not coal jobs,

3028
02:28:53,101 --> 02:28:54,610
but you know,
if you know,

3029
02:28:55,020 --> 02:28:56,880
fixing bridge,
clean infrastructure.

3030
02:28:56,900 --> 02:28:57,250
Right,
right.

3031
02:28:57,830 --> 02:29:00,330
If he starts doing that,
that,

3032
02:29:00,331 --> 02:29:01,370
that I have no,
I mean that's,

3033
02:29:01,530 --> 02:29:02,670
that'd be fantastic.
Right.

3034
02:29:02,671 --> 02:29:05,490
And it's possible he could start doing 
that for his own.

3035
02:29:06,220 --> 02:29:11,220
His motives wouldn't even matter 
ultimately as long as he was doing the 

3036
02:29:11,220 --> 02:29:14,880
right things.
But his motives are so reliably,

3037
02:29:15,760 --> 02:29:16,260
uh,

3038
02:29:17,620 --> 02:29:22,470
self-involved that give me what we need 
is a system we need to.

3039
02:29:22,510 --> 02:29:25,260
Someone needs to be able to play him.
I mean,

3040
02:29:25,280 --> 02:29:30,280
this kind of narcissistic Glockenspiel 
well enough to get him to do the things 

3041
02:29:30,341 --> 02:29:33,010
that would be good for the world,
but I just don't see.

3042
02:29:33,011 --> 02:29:33,570
I just,
just,

3043
02:29:33,610 --> 02:29:37,450
there's just too much chaos in the 
system for that to be a reliable.

3044
02:29:37,480 --> 02:29:38,350
Well,
like you,

3045
02:29:38,351 --> 02:29:43,351
they,
they try to keep him away from social 

3046
02:29:43,351 --> 02:29:43,351
media.
Oh yeah,

3047
02:29:43,351 --> 02:29:43,351
well that's working out.
I mean,

3048
02:29:43,351 --> 02:29:44,140
that's,
that's a big thing,

3049
02:29:44,141 --> 02:29:46,330
don't they?
They try to pull him away from it.

3050
02:29:46,730 --> 02:29:48,940
Yeah.
But that's been impossible.

3051
02:29:50,470 --> 02:29:51,630
No one can do it.
Yeah.

3052
02:29:51,680 --> 02:29:52,480
Yeah.
It's,

3053
02:29:52,490 --> 02:29:57,490
um,
remember that crazy press conference 

3054
02:29:57,490 --> 02:29:58,420
that he had like just a few weeks into 
being president.

3055
02:29:58,421 --> 02:29:59,660
I was unbelievable.
I had,

3056
02:29:59,770 --> 02:30:02,440
I got text messages from friends that 
are Republicans and they're like,

3057
02:30:02,441 --> 02:30:03,310
what the fuck?

3058
02:30:04,010 --> 02:30:04,550
Yeah.
But you know,

3059
02:30:04,551 --> 02:30:06,080
there are,
it's an interesting,

3060
02:30:06,100 --> 02:30:11,100
um,
it's an interesting sort of Roshak test 

3061
02:30:11,100 --> 02:30:14,110
because there are millions of Americans 
who watched that press conference and 

3062
02:30:14,110 --> 02:30:15,600
founded delightfully thought they 
thought that he was killed,

3063
02:30:15,601 --> 02:30:18,410
but pounding on the,
on the liberal media.

3064
02:30:19,790 --> 02:30:21,580
Yeah.
When you read a transcript,

3065
02:30:22,160 --> 02:30:25,000
when you read a transcript of what 
actually comes out of his mouth,

3066
02:30:25,290 --> 02:30:26,650
it's,
it is amazing.

3067
02:30:26,950 --> 02:30:27,670
I mean it,
the,

3068
02:30:27,680 --> 02:30:32,680
the,
the poverty of the passages in terms of 

3069
02:30:32,680 --> 02:30:36,600
information and I mean it's just the 
fact that we have a president who speaks

3070
02:30:36,851 --> 02:30:39,130
like,
this is cool.

3071
02:30:39,750 --> 02:30:43,660
I could never have foreseen that in our 
lifetime this was going to happen.

3072
02:30:44,160 --> 02:30:45,750
Just,
it's unimaginable to me.

3073
02:30:47,210 --> 02:30:52,210
Yeah.
I think a lot of people there are just 

3074
02:30:52,210 --> 02:30:52,210
indisputable,
millions of elitist signed it,

3075
02:30:52,210 --> 02:30:55,250
riff league concern to.
Did you see bill Maher's

3076
02:30:55,420 --> 02:31:00,420
thing about Anthony Wiener that he 
thinks that Anthony Wiener should run 

3077
02:31:00,420 --> 02:31:03,481
against trump.
We need our own crazy mad anthony 

3078
02:31:03,481 --> 02:31:07,741
wiener.
Besides his obvious addictions to 

3079
02:31:07,741 --> 02:31:11,370
sexting with people was a very powerful 
politician and a very good speaker and 

3080
02:31:12,280 --> 02:31:15,400
he had a lot of very good quality.
Who's going after bankers?

3081
02:31:15,401 --> 02:31:19,440
The same as the Eliot Spitzer,
Eliot Spitzer did a lot of good things.

3082
02:31:19,441 --> 02:31:23,840
He was going after the bankers.
He was going after corruption and yeah,

3083
02:31:23,850 --> 02:31:26,910
well I've said it but that.
That's an example.

3084
02:31:27,490 --> 02:31:32,490
There's a flag planted that shows us how
far we have gone from the normal.

3085
02:31:32,981 --> 02:31:37,981
I mean Elliot Spitzer destroyed himself 
with one instance of hypocrisy.

3086
02:31:39,040 --> 02:31:39,910
Right?
Right.

3087
02:31:40,070 --> 02:31:43,770
What was pretty bad?
Trump level bad.

3088
02:31:43,771 --> 02:31:46,560
I mean there's just no,
we don't have.

3089
02:31:46,590 --> 02:31:49,260
Well,
they'll pop in the law in this way.

3090
02:31:49,261 --> 02:31:49,920
I mean,
he was.

3091
02:31:50,010 --> 02:31:51,870
He was with a prostitute.
Well,

3092
02:31:51,871 --> 02:31:52,710
that's a stupid law.

3093
02:31:52,710 --> 02:31:57,710
The real problem was that he was going 
after going after Ross Johnson giant.

3094
02:31:58,350 --> 02:31:59,850
That was the real problem is the 
hypocrisy.

3095
02:32:00,240 --> 02:32:03,570
The hypocrisy wasn't that he did 
something illegal where you paid someone

3096
02:32:03,571 --> 02:32:08,571
for sex,
that that law seems to me to be so 

3097
02:32:08,571 --> 02:32:09,150
archaic and so ridiculous.
You could pay someone to massage you,

3098
02:32:09,151 --> 02:32:10,860
you can't pay someone to touch your 
genitals.

3099
02:32:11,040 --> 02:32:16,040
It seems ridiculous.
But I guess the other piece you have to 

3100
02:32:16,040 --> 02:32:20,000
put in play there is that there,
there are some percentage of people 

3101
02:32:20,011 --> 02:32:25,011
working in the sex trade who are not 
doing it voluntarily or coerced to one 

3102
02:32:25,011 --> 02:32:26,250
another.
And that's a horror show.

3103
02:32:26,251 --> 02:32:28,800
And that's part of the problem with that
is that it's illegal.

3104
02:32:28,950 --> 02:32:30,990
I mean,
that's the big argument is that,

3105
02:32:31,190 --> 02:32:32,910
well,
yes there is.

3106
02:32:32,990 --> 02:32:36,180
There is that argument and I agree with 
you that,

3107
02:32:36,240 --> 02:32:39,360
that it consenting adults should be able
to do what they want to do,

3108
02:32:39,361 --> 02:32:44,361
but the coop,
but the crucial variable there is 

3109
02:32:44,361 --> 02:32:44,361
consent and.

3110
02:32:45,180 --> 02:32:46,110
Agreed.
Agreed.

3111
02:32:46,370 --> 02:32:47,200
Yes.
Um,

3112
02:32:47,480 --> 02:32:52,480
I just think that someone is going to 
have to be dynamic.

3113
02:32:52,950 --> 02:32:57,950
They're gonna have to be,
they're going to have to engage people 

3114
02:32:58,080 --> 02:33:01,440
in a way that they're going to have to 
deal with his attacks.

3115
02:33:01,500 --> 02:33:06,500
It's case or maybe what's people will be
thirsting for after after four years is 

3116
02:33:06,930 --> 02:33:09,420
a is actually blend.
Yeah,

3117
02:33:09,421 --> 02:33:10,620
right.
Maybe right?

3118
02:33:10,920 --> 02:33:13,320
Yeah.
I would do with land right now.

3119
02:33:13,730 --> 02:33:18,730
Fantastic blend at blanded.
Actually super religious would be the 

3120
02:33:19,260 --> 02:33:22,050
might be happy for Ted Cruz and that 
blend.

3121
02:33:22,250 --> 02:33:27,250
No,
but my enthusiasm for impeachment 

3122
02:33:27,250 --> 02:33:27,250
suggests that I'm happy with pence.
Right.

3123
02:33:27,250 --> 02:33:30,030
Like so like if,
if I could find the impeachment button,

3124
02:33:30,090 --> 02:33:32,970
I would not hesitate to suppress it.
And pence,

3125
02:33:33,360 --> 02:33:35,640
given his religious commitments,
you know,

3126
02:33:35,650 --> 02:33:38,700
a few short years ago would've been 
among my worst nightmares.

3127
02:33:38,701 --> 02:33:41,760
I mean I would be talking about the rise
of the Christian.

3128
02:33:41,760 --> 02:33:46,760
Right.
And the danger of theocracy and I mean 

3129
02:33:46,760 --> 02:33:49,140
his,
but he's a psychologically he seems like

3130
02:33:49,290 --> 02:33:51,360
a normal,
predictable,

3131
02:33:51,720 --> 02:33:56,720
solid American compared to what we have.
Isn't the other question like trump's 

3132
02:33:59,221 --> 02:34:01,500
age,
he's a 70 year old man.

3133
02:34:01,950 --> 02:34:04,500
People don't really live that much past 
70,

3134
02:34:04,980 --> 02:34:09,980
especially people that are overweight 
and people that don't exercise all to 

3135
02:34:09,980 --> 02:34:12,580
healthy.
And that campaign was,

3136
02:34:13,010 --> 02:34:15,810
I can't believe.
I mean that's his energy and his credit.

3137
02:34:15,811 --> 02:34:20,811
Yeah,
I mean that's an amazing thing to be 

3138
02:34:20,811 --> 02:34:22,861
able to do.
How do you think it's most punishing 

3139
02:34:22,861 --> 02:34:22,861
thing in the world?
I can't even imagine.

3140
02:34:22,861 --> 02:34:27,220
Schedule is always having a good time.
Seriously did and in that press 

3141
02:34:29,341 --> 02:34:30,810
conference we're talking about 
[inaudible] 77,

3142
02:34:30,870 --> 02:34:32,850
I think it was 77 minutes press 
conference.

3143
02:34:33,180 --> 02:34:34,950
He looked like he was having a blast.
Yeah,

3144
02:34:35,370 --> 02:34:36,870
he gets like he gets really energized.

3145
02:34:38,560 --> 02:34:39,470
Yeah,
I mean that's.

3146
02:34:39,630 --> 02:34:42,890
It's got to be the most punishing,
beat down ever if you're,

3147
02:34:43,010 --> 02:34:47,270
if you're not designed for it.
I mean I can't imagine how tiring.

3148
02:34:47,430 --> 02:34:52,430
I'd never done a campaign.
I mean you get exhausted for 30 minutes 

3149
02:34:52,430 --> 02:34:52,430
of looking at your,
at mentions

3150
02:34:54,780 --> 02:34:56,850
now you have to be wired differently,
but you know,

3151
02:34:56,890 --> 02:35:01,890
he clearly is,
is he's wired that way.

3152
02:35:02,940 --> 02:35:07,940
It's worked for them.
But you need someone who's willing to 

3153
02:35:07,940 --> 02:35:10,401
submit to the punishment of running and 
that's a rare person or it's not.

3154
02:35:10,830 --> 02:35:15,830
And the problem is that kind of selects 
or things that you don't actually want 

3155
02:35:15,830 --> 02:35:18,810
in a president or at least I wouldn't 
think you would want.

3156
02:35:18,870 --> 02:35:23,870
I mean,
it's Aleks for kind of narcissism and a 

3157
02:35:23,870 --> 02:35:24,780
sense that,
that really has to be you,

3158
02:35:24,810 --> 02:35:25,610
right?
It doesn't,

3159
02:35:25,650 --> 02:35:30,650
that doesn't select for the normal 
intellectual space.

3160
02:35:31,531 --> 02:35:33,220
You,
you're constantly aware,

3161
02:35:33,280 --> 02:35:38,280
aware of the ways in which you are not 
the best guy or gal to be doing the 

3162
02:35:38,280 --> 02:35:38,280
thing,
right?

3163
02:35:38,280 --> 02:35:41,700
Like you want to defer to experts and,
and um,

3164
02:35:41,840 --> 02:35:44,190
you know,
trump is only I can fix it,

3165
02:35:44,250 --> 02:35:45,810
right?
And that worked.

3166
02:35:45,870 --> 02:35:50,870
And so you need something of that that 
creeps into the,

3167
02:35:51,091 --> 02:35:56,091
um,
the headspace of most politicians it 

3168
02:35:56,091 --> 02:35:56,091
seems.
And,

3169
02:35:56,091 --> 02:35:56,210
and,
um,

3170
02:35:56,330 --> 02:36:01,330
so scientific humility and I'm just a 
kind of a sense of the limits of,

3171
02:36:03,201 --> 02:36:08,201
of any one person's expertise is not 
necessarily the right piece of software 

3172
02:36:08,521 --> 02:36:12,090
to have running at when it comes time to
run for president.

3173
02:36:12,640 --> 02:36:14,510
Now I wanna switch gears a little bit.
It's not,

3174
02:36:14,560 --> 02:36:18,070
it's not totally related,
but it is in somewhat in some ways,

3175
02:36:18,580 --> 02:36:23,580
headspace.
I'm talking about mindsets and talking 

3176
02:36:23,580 --> 02:36:27,181
about like we've brought this up but 
really haven't delved into it much at 

3177
02:36:27,181 --> 02:36:31,171
all about meditation and about how much 
it's affected you and how it got you 

3178
02:36:31,171 --> 02:36:35,551
back on track.
And I know that you're a big proponent 

3179
02:36:35,551 --> 02:36:37,471
of it and I am as well,
although I think I'd probably do it 

3180
02:36:37,471 --> 02:36:40,951
differently than you guys do,
but I'd love to hear how you do it by 

3181
02:36:40,951 --> 02:36:42,000
using an isolation tank.
Oh really?

3182
02:36:42,010 --> 02:36:44,190
Like a sensory deprivation tank.
Yeah.

3183
02:36:44,520 --> 02:36:46,660
And I do a lot of yoga.
Those are,

3184
02:36:46,661 --> 02:36:48,850
those are two big ones for me.
You know,

3185
02:36:48,851 --> 02:36:53,530
I think those alone have straightened 
out my brain in a great way.

3186
02:36:53,531 --> 02:36:55,000
Yoga in particular,
Yoga,

3187
02:36:55,001 --> 02:36:55,880
because it's,
um,

3188
02:36:56,040 --> 02:37:01,040
it's not yoga forces you to do it.
You're either doing it or you're not 

3189
02:37:01,040 --> 02:37:03,670
doing it.
There's no room for distraction.

3190
02:37:03,760 --> 02:37:04,340
You know,
you're,

3191
02:37:04,341 --> 02:37:08,500
you're essentially forced to deal with 
what these poses require of you.

3192
02:37:08,830 --> 02:37:13,830
And I think that in doing so and having 
a singular focus of trying to maintain 

3193
02:37:14,771 --> 02:37:18,250
your and stretch and extend and do all 
these different things while you do it,

3194
02:37:18,251 --> 02:37:20,450
then concentrating almost entirely on 
your breath,

3195
02:37:20,451 --> 02:37:25,451
which is a big factor in yoga that it 
has remarkable brain scrubbing 

3196
02:37:26,301 --> 02:37:27,790
attributes.
Yeah.

3197
02:37:28,210 --> 02:37:32,170
I would say,
and I don't know much before I say this,

3198
02:37:32,171 --> 02:37:37,171
let me just ask,
what are you doing in the isolation 

3199
02:37:37,171 --> 02:37:39,421
tank?
Like what are you doing in your mind a 

3200
02:37:39,421 --> 02:37:39,421
lot?
Well,

3201
02:37:39,421 --> 02:37:39,421
you know,
do you use it for

3202
02:37:39,421 --> 02:37:40,410
a bunch of different in a bunch of 
different ways.

3203
02:37:41,130 --> 02:37:42,690
I don't use it as much as I should 
honestly.

3204
02:37:42,710 --> 02:37:47,710
Um,
but I concentrate on and sometimes I go 

3205
02:37:47,710 --> 02:37:51,651
in there with an idea,
like I'll concentrate on material like 

3206
02:37:51,651 --> 02:37:53,280
that I'm working on or maybe Jujitsu 
techniques that I'm having problems with

3207
02:37:53,730 --> 02:37:56,610
or some other things I'm dealing with,
you know,

3208
02:37:56,611 --> 02:37:57,960
any,
any sort of issues that I have.

3209
02:37:57,980 --> 02:38:02,980
Sometimes I do that sometimes it just go
in there and chill out and relax and 

3210
02:38:02,980 --> 02:38:06,561
breathe and concentrate.
There's a lot of physical things that 

3211
02:38:06,561 --> 02:38:09,381
happen inside the tank is the amount of 
magnesium in the water because it's 

3212
02:38:09,751 --> 02:38:12,120
epsom salts.
It's really good for you physically.

3213
02:38:12,121 --> 02:38:17,121
It's very good for the muscles.
It loosens you up and relaxes you and 

3214
02:38:17,121 --> 02:38:19,881
that eliminates a lot of stress.
And that physical elimination of stress 

3215
02:38:19,881 --> 02:38:24,171
allows the brain to function with just 
less pressure and allows you to relax 

3216
02:38:24,991 --> 02:38:26,670
more and put things in perspective 
better.

3217
02:38:27,120 --> 02:38:29,820
And it also,
it gives you this environment that's not

3218
02:38:29,821 --> 02:38:33,300
available anywhere else in the planet.
This weightless floating,

3219
02:38:33,660 --> 02:38:36,330
disconnected from your body environment 
where you're.

3220
02:38:37,110 --> 02:38:38,430
You don't hear anything,
you don't see anything,

3221
02:38:38,431 --> 02:38:40,140
you don't feel anything.
You feel like you're weightless.

3222
02:38:40,150 --> 02:38:45,150
You,
you have this sensation of flying 

3223
02:38:45,150 --> 02:38:46,920
because you're totally weightless,
weightless in the dark.

3224
02:38:46,921 --> 02:38:48,600
You Open your eyes,
you don't see anything,

3225
02:38:48,601 --> 02:38:50,310
you close your eyes.
It's exactly the same.

3226
02:38:50,580 --> 02:38:54,480
The water's the same temperature as your
skin so you don't feel the water and you

3227
02:38:54,481 --> 02:38:54,930
floating.

3228
02:38:55,590 --> 02:39:00,590
I'll say this,
I don't know how this is going to have 

3229
02:39:00,590 --> 02:39:02,130
to go down.
I actually don't have any questions 

3230
02:39:02,130 --> 02:39:02,130
about the,
the,

3231
02:39:02,130 --> 02:39:05,610
the benefits of being in an isolation 
tank even though I don't know too much 

3232
02:39:05,610 --> 02:39:07,370
about it.
And I also am a PR.

3233
02:39:07,440 --> 02:39:10,080
I think yoga is great,
although I don't do much of it myself.

3234
02:39:10,610 --> 02:39:15,610
I,
I think though that there may actually 

3235
02:39:15,610 --> 02:39:17,931
be a difference between those two 
activities and meditation because it a 

3236
02:39:17,931 --> 02:39:22,401
kind of highfalutin term metacognition,
sort of knowing what you know or knowing

3237
02:39:23,851 --> 02:39:28,851
that you're thinking that happens in the
kind of mindfulness meditation of which,

3238
02:39:29,120 --> 02:39:31,740
uh,
Sam and I are proponents proponents that

3239
02:39:31,741 --> 02:39:36,450
I think is a different thing where 
you're seeing.

3240
02:39:36,540 --> 02:39:37,890
And I'll just try to put this in 
English.

3241
02:39:38,100 --> 02:39:41,280
When you're meditating the way we do,
you're seeing how crazy you are.

3242
02:39:41,310 --> 02:39:42,510
You're sitting,
you're fucking nuts,

3243
02:39:42,600 --> 02:39:45,000
and that actually has a real value.

3244
02:39:45,240 --> 02:39:50,240
Is systematic collision with the asshole
in your head has a real value because 

3245
02:39:50,240 --> 02:39:54,030
when the asshole offers you up a shitty 
suggestion in the rest of your life,

3246
02:39:54,031 --> 02:39:57,120
which is basically it's job like,
oh yeah,

3247
02:39:57,121 --> 02:40:02,121
you should eat the 17th cookie or say 
the thing that's going to ruin the next 

3248
02:40:02,121 --> 02:40:04,560
48 hours of your marriage or whatever.
You're better able to resist it.

3249
02:40:04,710 --> 02:40:06,270
So what,
like what do you do?

3250
02:40:06,390 --> 02:40:09,840
So I mean the basic steps of mindfulness
meditation or to sit.

3251
02:40:10,080 --> 02:40:13,140
Most people close their eyes.
You bring your full attention,

3252
02:40:13,230 --> 02:40:14,850
the feeling of your breath.
Just the,

3253
02:40:14,960 --> 02:40:19,960
you're not thinking about your breath,
just feeling the raw data of the 

3254
02:40:19,960 --> 02:40:22,740
physical sensations,
and then the third step is the Biggie,

3255
02:40:22,770 --> 02:40:25,470
which is as soon as you try to do this,
your mind's going to go bonkers.

3256
02:40:25,471 --> 02:40:27,770
You're going to start thinking about 
what's for lunch to an eight,

3257
02:40:27,771 --> 02:40:30,540
a haircut,
where did your bills run wild,

3258
02:40:30,541 --> 02:40:31,200
whatever,
blah,

3259
02:40:31,201 --> 02:40:31,710
blah,
blah.

3260
02:40:31,710 --> 02:40:33,900
You're just going to notice,
oh,

3261
02:40:34,010 --> 02:40:39,010
I'm my mind's going crazy right now.
But that noticing is the key moment is 

3262
02:40:39,010 --> 02:40:42,861
the fact that victory.
It's interesting because this is when 

3263
02:40:42,861 --> 02:40:43,220
most people think they failed that 
because,

3264
02:40:43,230 --> 02:40:48,230
oh,
I can't meditate because I can't clear 

3265
02:40:48,230 --> 02:40:48,230
my mind.
This is the,

3266
02:40:48,230 --> 02:40:48,780
the biggest misconception about 
meditation.

3267
02:40:48,781 --> 02:40:53,781
You do not need to clear your mind.
That's impossible unless you're 

3268
02:40:53,781 --> 02:40:53,850
enlightened or dead.
Uh,

3269
02:40:53,851 --> 02:40:58,851
the whole goal is just to notice when 
you've become distracted and start 

3270
02:40:58,851 --> 02:40:58,851
again.
You return your attention to your breath

3271
02:40:59,010 --> 02:41:04,010
and you just do that a million times and
every time you catch yourself wondering 

3272
02:41:04,010 --> 02:41:05,970
and go back to your breath,
it's a bicep curl for your brain.

3273
02:41:06,420 --> 02:41:11,420
It changes your brain and that over time
creates the kind of Meta cognition I was

3274
02:41:13,711 --> 02:41:18,711
discussing before where you see that 
you're a homo sapiens sapiens another 

3275
02:41:18,711 --> 02:41:19,080
word zero,
a,

3276
02:41:19,170 --> 02:41:21,000
that's how we're classified as a 
species,

3277
02:41:21,330 --> 02:41:26,330
the one who thinks and knows he or she 
thinks and that just that knowing that 

3278
02:41:26,971 --> 02:41:29,310
you have this voice in your head,
uh,

3279
02:41:29,350 --> 02:41:34,350
as Sam likes to joke,
he feels like when he thinks about the 

3280
02:41:34,350 --> 02:41:37,731
voice in his head,
he feels like he's been hijacked by the 

3281
02:41:37,731 --> 02:41:37,731
most boring person alive.

3282
02:41:37,731 --> 02:41:39,640
Just says the same shit over and over.
I'm a,

3283
02:41:39,680 --> 02:41:42,630
a joke that I deal from them all the 
time.

3284
02:41:42,631 --> 02:41:43,650
Yeah.
Uh,

3285
02:41:43,800 --> 02:41:47,130
that,
that is enormously powerful because then

3286
02:41:47,160 --> 02:41:49,260
you are not held hostage by this voice.

3287
02:41:49,970 --> 02:41:52,090
A similar thing happens in the tank.
Um,

3288
02:41:52,190 --> 02:41:54,980
I do a do a form of meditation,
that tank.

3289
02:41:54,981 --> 02:41:57,290
Sometimes when I go in there with or 
without an idea,

3290
02:41:57,291 --> 02:42:00,590
like if I'm not working on material or 
anything else where I just concentrating

3291
02:42:00,591 --> 02:42:02,930
on my breath in through the nose,
out through the mouth,

3292
02:42:02,931 --> 02:42:04,790
and I just literally concentrate on the 
breath.

3293
02:42:04,791 --> 02:42:06,350
And the same thing happens to 
meditation.

3294
02:42:07,420 --> 02:42:10,000
Meditation.
It's similar,

3295
02:42:10,010 --> 02:42:13,010
it's the exact same thing.
The difference is in the tank.

3296
02:42:13,280 --> 02:42:16,220
After Awhile,
after about 20 minutes or so,

3297
02:42:16,221 --> 02:42:19,910
that breaks loose to psychedelic states.
Wow.

3298
02:42:20,170 --> 02:42:22,060
Have you ever combined the tank with 
psychedelics?

3299
02:42:22,300 --> 02:42:23,530
Altered state,
so yeah.

3300
02:42:23,860 --> 02:42:25,500
Yeah.
Sweat trip.

3301
02:42:25,510 --> 02:42:27,830
What?
LSD or mushrooms?

3302
02:42:27,980 --> 02:42:29,870
Mushrooms,
but the big one is edible pot.

3303
02:42:30,110 --> 02:42:32,270
Edible pod seems to be as strong as 
anything in there.

3304
02:42:32,900 --> 02:42:35,720
Like I've got enough pot where I'm 
convinced I'm going to die,

3305
02:42:35,760 --> 02:42:38,600
then I climb in there and every time I 
do it I go,

3306
02:42:38,601 --> 02:42:40,700
don't do that again.
So just get out.

3307
02:42:40,701 --> 02:42:41,630
So terrified

3308
02:42:41,880 --> 02:42:44,220
your motivation when you're eating the 
pot and climbing into.

3309
02:42:44,590 --> 02:42:46,230
We'll see what happens.
Okay.

3310
02:42:46,340 --> 02:42:47,840
Yeah.
Just be scared.

3311
02:42:48,020 --> 02:42:49,380
Be terrified.
Yeah.

3312
02:42:49,381 --> 02:42:51,710
Because nothing ever happens.
You never die,

3313
02:42:52,190 --> 02:42:57,190
but God damn you just convinced that the
universe is imploding around you and 

3314
02:42:57,190 --> 02:42:59,120
that it just.
So it usually has the,

3315
02:42:59,190 --> 02:43:04,190
the character of fear being part of it.
It's also not embracing the fear,

3316
02:43:04,960 --> 02:43:09,960
not letting the fear run rampant and 
just sort of relaxing and giving into 

3317
02:43:09,960 --> 02:43:10,580
the vulnerability,
your,

3318
02:43:10,581 --> 02:43:12,580
the finite of your existence

3319
02:43:12,580 --> 02:43:14,860
and just breathing and concentrating and
letting.

3320
02:43:15,340 --> 02:43:17,410
Letting the dance take place because 
there's some.

3321
02:43:17,411 --> 02:43:22,411
There's some sort of a weird that one of
the things that there's a big 

3322
02:43:22,411 --> 02:43:23,380
misconception about when it comes to 
edible pot,

3323
02:43:23,440 --> 02:43:27,100
is it edible pod is like smoking pot.
It's an entirely different process.

3324
02:43:27,460 --> 02:43:30,940
Physiologically.
Your liver time course is very different

3325
02:43:30,941 --> 02:43:32,800
to it.
We can stay stolen for three days.

3326
02:43:32,870 --> 02:43:33,420
Yeah.
You,

3327
02:43:33,790 --> 02:43:38,790
you could fuck up and eat too many 
brownies and you'll be gone for a long 

3328
02:43:38,790 --> 02:43:39,640
time.
That sounds miserable.

3329
02:43:39,790 --> 02:43:44,790
It is,
but it's not because he gets something 

3330
02:43:44,790 --> 02:43:46,120
out of it when it's over the.
The process is excruciating,

3331
02:43:46,121 --> 02:43:48,840
but when you come out of it,
you just feel so happy.

3332
02:43:49,260 --> 02:43:50,290
Feel so happy.
It's over.

3333
02:43:50,470 --> 02:43:54,400
Is it like the joke about the dude is 
banging his head up against the wall and

3334
02:43:54,401 --> 02:43:55,500
somebody says,
why are you doing that?

3335
02:43:55,510 --> 02:43:57,280
He says,
because it feels so good when I stopped

3336
02:43:58,160 --> 02:44:03,160
in a way,
but there's no physical damage banging 

3337
02:44:03,160 --> 02:44:03,160
your head up against the wall.
You're going to hurt yourself.

3338
02:44:03,160 --> 02:44:03,160
This is true.

3339
02:44:03,160 --> 02:44:04,420
Uh,
yeah.

3340
02:44:04,421 --> 02:44:09,421
I don't know.
I think there seems like there might be 

3341
02:44:09,421 --> 02:44:09,421
easier ways to get to the same wisdom.

3342
02:44:09,421 --> 02:44:12,990
Maybe,
but I think there's also creativity that

3343
02:44:12,991 --> 02:44:17,991
gets inspired by the edible pot,
something called 11 hydroxy metabolite 

3344
02:44:18,661 --> 02:44:23,661
that your body produces.
It's so different than most people when 

3345
02:44:23,661 --> 02:44:26,751
they eat pot,
they think they been dosed like anybody 

3346
02:44:26,751 --> 02:44:27,210
who smoked pot before and then you give 
them a Brownie.

3347
02:44:27,211 --> 02:44:27,840
They think,
oh my God,

3348
02:44:27,841 --> 02:44:32,841
there something in that,
and they're convinced because reality 

3349
02:44:32,841 --> 02:44:35,250
itself just seems like it just dissolves
and especially inside the tank,

3350
02:44:35,280 --> 02:44:37,890
there's something about the tank 
environment that produces.

3351
02:44:38,280 --> 02:44:43,280
In the absence of any external stimuli,
your brain becomes sort of supercharged 

3352
02:44:43,860 --> 02:44:48,860
because what you're trying to do when 
you're just sitting down and 

3353
02:44:48,860 --> 02:44:50,790
concentrating and relaxing as you're 
trying to focus on your thoughts,

3354
02:44:50,791 --> 02:44:55,791
but you're still aware of your body.
You're still aware of your elbows 

3355
02:44:55,791 --> 02:44:55,980
touching this desk,
your butt touching the chair.

3356
02:44:55,981 --> 02:44:58,290
There's all these different factors that
are that are.

3357
02:44:58,410 --> 02:45:01,890
There's stimuli that's coming into your 
senses.

3358
02:45:02,250 --> 02:45:05,160
Whereas in the tank there's none of that
virtually.

3359
02:45:05,190 --> 02:45:07,290
It's almost completely eliminated.
There's some,

3360
02:45:07,530 --> 02:45:08,670
but you can.
You can.

3361
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:14,000
You could phase that stuff out,
like you could still feel the water a 

3362
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:14,000
little bit.
If you think about it,

3363
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:16,710
you could still use,
sometimes you bump into the wall and you

3364
02:45:16,711 --> 02:45:20,460
have to like center yourself and you 
have to relax again and make sure you're

3365
02:45:20,461 --> 02:45:25,461
not moving so you don't touch things 
which can kind of dissolve the 

3366
02:45:25,461 --> 02:45:27,290
experience,
their experiences,

3367
02:45:27,330 --> 02:45:32,330
meditation where you have that same 
experience where you lose your sense of 

3368
02:45:32,330 --> 02:45:36,110
the body,
but that usually comes with more 

3369
02:45:36,110 --> 02:45:36,900
concentration.
You have to be very concentrated on it.

3370
02:45:37,050 --> 02:45:42,050
I feel like you would have that 
experience and it would be even more 

3371
02:45:42,050 --> 02:45:45,981
intense if you did the exact same thing 
that you do outside the tank in the 

3372
02:45:45,981 --> 02:45:45,981
tank.

3373
02:45:45,981 --> 02:45:46,590
I don't think you need any psychedelics 
and the tangle.

3374
02:45:46,920 --> 02:45:48,720
It's one thing that I tell people when 
they ask me,

3375
02:45:49,440 --> 02:45:50,880
should I get high before I do it?
I'm like,

3376
02:45:50,881 --> 02:45:51,930
no,
just do it.

3377
02:45:52,470 --> 02:45:54,440
Just do it.
If you decide after a while,

3378
02:45:54,441 --> 02:45:55,820
if you've done it three or four times,
you was like,

3379
02:45:55,830 --> 02:45:58,950
I wonder what it's like if I just take a
little bit of a hit of pot and see where

3380
02:45:58,951 --> 02:46:00,670
it takes me and there's nothing wrong 
with that.

3381
02:46:00,671 --> 02:46:05,671
It's not going to hurt you,
and if you're a type of person who 

3382
02:46:05,671 --> 02:46:08,151
enjoys marijuana or whatever,
but the tank alone by itself,

3383
02:46:08,221 --> 02:46:10,280
just the absence of sensory input,

3384
02:46:10,310 --> 02:46:15,310
your brain goes to a very,
very different place and as long as you 

3385
02:46:15,310 --> 02:46:18,491
can relax and as long as you don't think
too much about the fact that you're in 

3386
02:46:18,491 --> 02:46:22,781
the tank,
just concentrate entirely on your 

3387
02:46:22,781 --> 02:46:22,781
thoughts entirely on your breath.
And again,

3388
02:46:22,781 --> 02:46:25,970
let all those crazy like where to 
hamsters live like all that shit.

3389
02:46:26,330 --> 02:46:28,340
Let let all that stuff run wild through 
your mouth,

3390
02:46:28,370 --> 02:46:32,170
but I feel like in the tank at least 
that gets to a certain spot.

3391
02:46:32,220 --> 02:46:35,390
Then it stops existing and then the 
psychedelic state takes over.

3392
02:46:36,260 --> 02:46:38,150
Yeah,
well it depends on what the goal is.

3393
02:46:38,151 --> 02:46:43,151
I think there can be many different 
goals of meditation or quasi spiritual 

3394
02:46:46,040 --> 02:46:49,010
practice and they're not there.
They're distinct.

3395
02:46:49,011 --> 02:46:54,011
So the center of the Bullseye for me is 
not suffering unnecessarily.

3396
02:46:56,360 --> 02:46:56,810
Right?
So.

3397
02:46:56,811 --> 02:47:01,811
And so one thing that,
that mindfulness gives you is so it's 

3398
02:47:02,760 --> 02:47:07,760
potentially,
it's compatible with every experience 

3399
02:47:07,760 --> 02:47:07,760
you can have.

3400
02:47:07,760 --> 02:47:12,280
I mean,
there's is nothing in your experience 

3401
02:47:12,280 --> 02:47:12,280
that isn't inappropriate object of 
meditation.

3402
02:47:12,280 --> 02:47:16,181
You just,
most people start with the breath 

3403
02:47:16,181 --> 02:47:16,181
because it's just a very convenient 
thing to start with,

3404
02:47:16,181 --> 02:47:18,860
but once you know how to do this 
particular practice,

3405
02:47:19,640 --> 02:47:23,720
you're just,
your goal is to just be clearly aware of

3406
02:47:23,721 --> 02:47:25,760
whatever your experience is in each 
moment.

3407
02:47:25,761 --> 02:47:28,790
So it's emotions arise,
thoughts arise,

3408
02:47:28,791 --> 02:47:33,791
sounds come in your,
your attention is wide open to whatever 

3409
02:47:34,401 --> 02:47:36,320
your experience is.
So it's not like.

3410
02:47:36,590 --> 02:47:38,600
So.
Nothing in principle is a distraction.

3411
02:47:38,601 --> 02:47:43,601
I mean that could be,
you can be meditating right next to a 

3412
02:47:43,601 --> 02:47:45,131
construction site and the sound of the 
hammers is just as good and object of 

3413
02:47:45,561 --> 02:47:47,630
meditation as the breath or anything 
else.

3414
02:47:47,631 --> 02:47:49,070
So there's nothing.
Everything is included,

3415
02:47:49,640 --> 02:47:51,580
but the,
the,

3416
02:47:52,130 --> 02:47:57,130
the superpower you're after,
which you actually can acquire through 

3417
02:47:57,561 --> 02:48:02,561
this practice is to realize that 
virtually all of your,

3418
02:48:03,770 --> 02:48:08,150
of your psychological suffering and 
actually arguably,

3419
02:48:08,151 --> 02:48:13,151
virtually all of your,
your physical suffering or the 

3420
02:48:13,151 --> 02:48:14,750
difference between physical pain and 
suffering,

3421
02:48:14,810 --> 02:48:16,940
which I mean,
those two are not quite the same thing.

3422
02:48:17,500 --> 02:48:22,500
Um,
is a matter of being lost in thought as 

3423
02:48:22,500 --> 02:48:23,540
a matter of thinking,
without knowing that you're thinking and

3424
02:48:23,541 --> 02:48:28,541
what and what mindfulness does.
And really any technique of meditation 

3425
02:48:28,541 --> 02:48:32,480
ultimately should do,
is teach you to break the spell of being

3426
02:48:32,481 --> 02:48:35,720
lost in thought and to notice a thought 
as a thought.

3427
02:48:35,721 --> 02:48:36,320
I mean the,
the,

3428
02:48:36,330 --> 02:48:41,330
the huge difference is until you learn 
how to meditate or do something like 

3429
02:48:41,330 --> 02:48:45,431
meditation,
you're just helplessly thinking every 

3430
02:48:45,431 --> 02:48:48,821
moment of your life,
you're having a conversation with 

3431
02:48:48,821 --> 02:48:48,821
yourself.
You're having content,

3432
02:48:48,821 --> 02:48:50,210
whether it's images,
stick or linguistic,

3433
02:48:50,600 --> 02:48:54,890
poor forth into consciousness,
every moment and so incessantly that you

3434
02:48:54,891 --> 02:48:56,660
don't even notice it.
It's just white noise.

3435
02:48:57,440 --> 02:49:02,440
And not only does it completely color 
your experience moment to moment.

3436
02:49:03,471 --> 02:49:04,940
So like if you're,
if they're angry thoughts,

3437
02:49:04,941 --> 02:49:09,941
you're angry.
If they're depressed thoughts or you're 

3438
02:49:09,941 --> 02:49:09,941
depressed or sad that you're sad.

3439
02:49:09,941 --> 02:49:12,150
So you become your thoughts,
but you also feel,

3440
02:49:12,990 --> 02:49:14,700
you feel,
you feel identified,

3441
02:49:14,701 --> 02:49:17,130
you feel that you are the thinker of 
your thoughts.

3442
02:49:17,131 --> 02:49:21,020
You feel like a self and it's completely
structured by this flow of,

3443
02:49:21,021 --> 02:49:26,021
of mentation every moment and it 
produces everything you do.

3444
02:49:26,461 --> 02:49:29,160
It produces all of your intentions and 
your goals and your actions,

3445
02:49:29,161 --> 02:49:31,530
and he said this about me and now I'm 
going to say that.

3446
02:49:31,531 --> 02:49:36,531
I mean,
so it's like it's everything coming out 

3447
02:49:36,531 --> 02:49:38,091
of you is born of of this same process 
and meditation is a way of recognizing 

3448
02:49:40,920 --> 02:49:45,920
that consciousness and then what you are
subjectively as a prior condition of 

3449
02:49:45,920 --> 02:49:47,670
just be awareness in which everything is
showing up,

3450
02:49:47,671 --> 02:49:51,840
sounds,
sensations and thoughts and thoughts can

3451
02:49:51,841 --> 02:49:56,841
become just other objects of 
consciousness and I'm so I'm going to 

3452
02:49:57,511 --> 02:49:58,060
take eva,
Eva,

3453
02:49:58,110 --> 02:50:03,110
at a very basic example of the 
difference between between pain and 

3454
02:50:03,871 --> 02:50:04,440
suffering.

3455
02:50:04,980 --> 02:50:09,980
You can feel very strong physical pain,
I mean unpleasant pain and just be aware

3456
02:50:14,011 --> 02:50:19,011
of it in that sense that it's unbearable
is virtually always untrue because you 

3457
02:50:19,260 --> 02:50:20,760
in that moment,
you've already born it,

3458
02:50:20,820 --> 02:50:21,320
right?
That may,

3459
02:50:21,460 --> 02:50:26,460
that the feeling that something's 
unbearable is really the fear of having 

3460
02:50:26,460 --> 02:50:28,710
to experience it in the next moment in 
the future.

3461
02:50:28,740 --> 02:50:30,170
Right?
Because you're almost like if some.

3462
02:50:30,180 --> 02:50:32,880
If someone drives a nail into your knee,
right?

3463
02:50:32,881 --> 02:50:33,920
You might only.
That's a.

3464
02:50:34,270 --> 02:50:38,190
That sounds like it's unbearable,
but every moment you're feeling it,

3465
02:50:38,550 --> 02:50:40,020
you're burying it,
right?

3466
02:50:40,021 --> 02:50:40,470
It's like,
it's,

3467
02:50:40,520 --> 02:50:45,520
it's what you're,
what you're thinking about is the last 

3468
02:50:45,520 --> 02:50:48,201
moment and the next moment.
Then you're thinking about how much you 

3469
02:50:48,201 --> 02:50:51,001
know,
when am I going to get some relief and 

3470
02:50:51,001 --> 02:50:51,001
you know,
what's the cure and how badly is my knee

3471
02:50:51,001 --> 02:50:51,700
injured?
And you know,

3472
02:50:51,730 --> 02:50:52,140
like you're,
you're,

3473
02:50:52,200 --> 02:50:57,200
you're,
you're worried about the future 

3474
02:50:57,200 --> 02:50:57,990
continuously and you're not noticing the
automaticity of thought that is,

3475
02:50:58,020 --> 02:51:01,080
that is amplifying the,
the,

3476
02:51:01,230 --> 02:51:06,230
the,
the negative negativity of the 

3477
02:51:06,230 --> 02:51:06,230
experience in that moment.

3478
02:51:06,230 --> 02:51:09,680
And we all know that you can have super 
intense sensation which is either either

3479
02:51:12,660 --> 02:51:17,660
pleasant or unpleasant depending on the,
on the conceptual frame you've put 

3480
02:51:17,660 --> 02:51:17,660
around it.
So for instance,

3481
02:51:17,660 --> 02:51:22,551
if,
if you had this massive sense of 

3482
02:51:22,551 --> 02:51:27,111
soreness in your shoulder that you would
experience it very differently if it was

3483
02:51:27,961 --> 02:51:30,900
a,
the result of you dead lifting more than

3484
02:51:30,901 --> 02:51:32,970
you ever had in your life and you were 
proud of it,

3485
02:51:33,090 --> 02:51:37,200
right?
Be probably cancer.

3486
02:51:37,201 --> 02:51:38,310
And you're waiting for your,
you know,

3487
02:51:38,311 --> 02:51:39,810
the,
the biopsy results.

3488
02:51:39,840 --> 02:51:40,500
And,
and,

3489
02:51:40,590 --> 02:51:41,280
and,
uh,

3490
02:51:41,400 --> 02:51:43,520
you know,
you're worried about this is the thing,

3491
02:51:43,630 --> 02:51:48,630
the thing is going to kill you or you're
getting raw for some deep tissue massage

3492
02:51:48,781 --> 02:51:53,781
and it hurts like hell,
but you actually totally understand the 

3493
02:51:53,781 --> 02:51:55,110
source of the pain and you know,
it's going to be gone the moment the guy

3494
02:51:55,111 --> 02:51:56,490
pulls his elbow back,
right?

3495
02:51:56,790 --> 02:51:59,940
So it could be the exact same sensation 
each one of those,

3496
02:51:59,941 --> 02:52:04,941
but the conceptual frame you have around
it totally dictates the level of 

3497
02:52:04,941 --> 02:52:05,980
psychological suffering and,
or the or

3498
02:52:05,980 --> 02:52:08,530
the can dictate the total absence of 
psychological suffering.

3499
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:15,000
Now we were talking before the podcast 
started about your apps and we were 

3500
02:52:15,000 --> 02:52:18,760
talking about the amount of different 
meditation exercises on the APP.

3501
02:52:18,761 --> 02:52:21,760
So like what kind of different 
meditation exercises are there?

3502
02:52:22,000 --> 02:52:27,000
If you're talking about just 
concentrating on mindfulness and 

3503
02:52:27,000 --> 02:52:27,000
breathing,

3504
02:52:27,000 --> 02:52:27,720
uh,
as it turns out,

3505
02:52:27,750 --> 02:52:31,860
you can iterate off of that basic 
exercise a in some to,

3506
02:52:32,240 --> 02:52:37,240
to like a infinity essentially because 
you talk about not only will I lose my,

3507
02:52:41,070 --> 02:52:43,470
I don't want to get too ahead of myself,
but basically the,

3508
02:52:43,471 --> 02:52:48,471
the,
the basic instructions are that we 

3509
02:52:48,471 --> 02:52:48,471
listed before.
You're feeling your breath coming in and

3510
02:52:48,471 --> 02:52:49,800
then when you get lost,
you start again,

3511
02:52:50,070 --> 02:52:55,070
but then you can add onto that.
So one big thing to add on is something 

3512
02:52:55,231 --> 02:52:59,580
called mental noting,
so you're breathing in and out,

3513
02:52:59,640 --> 02:53:04,640
you're feeling your breath,
and then you get distracted by a huge 

3514
02:53:04,640 --> 02:53:04,640
wave of anger.
Generally speaking,

3515
02:53:04,640 --> 02:53:07,590
when we get hit by a wave of anger,
we just inhabit the anger.

3516
02:53:07,591 --> 02:53:12,591
We become angry.
There's no buffer between the stimulus 

3517
02:53:12,591 --> 02:53:15,530
and our response to it,
but there's this little technique you 

3518
02:53:15,530 --> 02:53:16,080
can do of just making a little mental 
note of,

3519
02:53:16,140 --> 02:53:16,710
Oh,
that's anger.

3520
02:53:18,090 --> 02:53:23,090
And that kind of objectifies the thing.
It's a little bit like pressing the 

3521
02:53:23,090 --> 02:53:27,021
picture and picture button on your 
remote control where the story that's 

3522
02:53:27,021 --> 02:53:28,080
taken up,
the whole frame can be seen with some,

3523
02:53:28,770 --> 02:53:30,150
uh,
perspective.

3524
02:53:30,930 --> 02:53:33,270
Uh,
so that's just one example of the little

3525
02:53:33,271 --> 02:53:35,670
techniques that you can add onto the 
basic exercise.

3526
02:53:35,671 --> 02:53:40,671
And you can go for a long time.
So as we were discussing Sam's about to 

3527
02:53:40,671 --> 02:53:44,841
start his meditation APP,
which is going to be called what sent 

3528
02:53:44,841 --> 02:53:44,841
waking up,
waking up.

3529
02:53:44,841 --> 02:53:46,020
And I have mine,
which is called 10 percent happier.

3530
02:53:46,470 --> 02:53:49,700
Sam is going to be doing all the 
teaching on his APP and my,

3531
02:53:49,740 --> 02:53:51,330
on my absence.
I'm not a teacher.

3532
02:53:51,380 --> 02:53:54,900
We have experts coming in like Joseph 
Goldstein,

3533
02:53:54,901 --> 02:53:58,200
who's again the friend of a friend of 
both Sam and I,

3534
02:53:58,201 --> 02:54:01,830
um,
a and you,

3535
02:54:02,010 --> 02:54:07,010
each teacher has their own emphasis and 
you then start talking about applied 

3536
02:54:07,021 --> 02:54:07,560
meditation.

3537
02:54:07,560 --> 02:54:11,040
So how do I use it when we're,
how do I use in my everyday life?

3538
02:54:11,340 --> 02:54:14,640
How do I use it if really what I want to
do right now is,

3539
02:54:14,770 --> 02:54:16,530
um,
control my eating.

3540
02:54:16,710 --> 02:54:17,910
So meditation,
for example,

3541
02:54:17,911 --> 02:54:21,240
we have a course on the APP that talks 
about using it to not overeat.

3542
02:54:21,540 --> 02:54:23,070
By the way,
I'm terrible at this,

3543
02:54:23,250 --> 02:54:25,890
but you can use your ability,
your mindfulness,

3544
02:54:25,891 --> 02:54:30,891
your ability to know what's happening in
your head in any given moment without 

3545
02:54:30,891 --> 02:54:31,530
getting carried away by it to not 
overeat.

3546
02:54:31,800 --> 02:54:32,370
Notice,
Oh,

3547
02:54:32,371 --> 02:54:36,500
I'm having this urge right now to eat as
I did last night in entire bag of melted

3548
02:54:38,040 --> 02:54:40,020
chocolate in my hotel room.
Uh,

3549
02:54:40,320 --> 02:54:45,320
but I don't,
I can ride that urge and not do the 

3550
02:54:45,320 --> 02:54:45,400
thing that I know is stupid.
Um,

3551
02:54:45,720 --> 02:54:50,720
so anyway,
that's just a little taste of how you 

3552
02:54:50,720 --> 02:54:52,140
can take meditation and bring it in 
numerous directions.

3553
02:54:53,970 --> 02:54:54,120
Do

3554
02:54:54,120 --> 02:54:58,560
you guys feel competitive?
Both of apps now isn't even out yet?

3555
02:54:58,620 --> 02:55:00,870
No,
not yet.

3556
02:55:00,930 --> 02:55:02,970
When he comes out and completely 
cannibalize cannibalizes

3557
02:55:04,130 --> 02:55:08,180
men both then yeah.
How happy is for me 10 percent happier.

3558
02:55:08,970 --> 02:55:13,130
I'll be like negative 100 percent.
What's 10 percent of zero?

3559
02:55:13,290 --> 02:55:14,050
Yeah,
exactly.

3560
02:55:14,120 --> 02:55:15,980
No,
I actually think I'm of the view,

3561
02:55:15,981 --> 02:55:20,981
you know,
now that I've been in this meditation 

3562
02:55:20,981 --> 02:55:20,981
APP business for a little while,
I'm kind of,

3563
02:55:20,981 --> 02:55:25,100
I don't think it's Uber,
I don't think the business model is that

3564
02:55:25,101 --> 02:55:29,270
there's just one huge app that everybody
uses and maybe there's some distant,

3565
02:55:29,330 --> 02:55:30,230
you know,
second,

3566
02:55:30,500 --> 02:55:32,450
I actually think it's more,
a little bit more like fast food.

3567
02:55:32,870 --> 02:55:36,020
I think it's going to be a bunch of big 
players and uh,

3568
02:55:36,021 --> 02:55:37,970
in,
you may switch back and forth.

3569
02:55:38,350 --> 02:55:40,430
Um,
and so I think it's just one need a nap.

3570
02:55:40,890 --> 02:55:41,600
No,
no,

3571
02:55:41,630 --> 02:55:42,110
no you don't.

3572
02:55:42,150 --> 02:55:47,150
But I mean,
the thing that's useful and it's really 

3573
02:55:47,150 --> 02:55:49,671
useful at any level of expertise in,
in meditation and that at least this 

3574
02:55:49,921 --> 02:55:53,220
kind of meditation is having someone 
guide you.

3575
02:55:53,250 --> 02:55:54,060
Yeah,
it's,

3576
02:55:54,100 --> 02:55:58,320
it's like a a mindfulness alarm that's 
constantly going off,

3577
02:55:58,400 --> 02:56:03,400
going off and you know,
periodically over the course of 10 

3578
02:56:03,400 --> 02:56:06,081
minutes or 20 minutes or however long 
you're sitting and because distraction 

3579
02:56:06,601 --> 02:56:11,601
is just continually the problem and 
you're either meditating or you're 

3580
02:56:11,601 --> 02:56:11,601
distracted.
You're either,

3581
02:56:11,601 --> 02:56:16,581
you're either aware of what's happening 
at that moment or you're lost in 

3582
02:56:16,581 --> 02:56:18,540
thought.
And that's true throughout your life.

3583
02:56:18,541 --> 02:56:23,541
I mean,
you're either hearing what I'm saying 

3584
02:56:23,541 --> 02:56:25,401
right now,
or you're thinking about something else 

3585
02:56:25,401 --> 02:56:25,401
and you don't know it,
right?

3586
02:56:25,401 --> 02:56:28,340
Or you're.
You're either reading the book you're 

3587
02:56:28,340 --> 02:56:28,500
intending to read or your mind is 
wandering.

3588
02:56:28,501 --> 02:56:30,030
You're going to have to read that 
paragraph again.

3589
02:56:30,090 --> 02:56:32,130
So this,
this failure to concentrate,

3590
02:56:32,131 --> 02:56:35,400
this failure to be able to focus on what
you're intending to focus on.

3591
02:56:35,970 --> 02:56:40,970
Is it just this,
this universal problem of human 

3592
02:56:40,970 --> 02:56:45,501
consciousness.
And so meditation trains that and other 

3593
02:56:46,621 --> 02:56:51,621
benefits follow,
but the having a voice in your head 

3594
02:56:51,621 --> 02:56:55,760
reminding you that you're even 
attempting to be meditating is a very 

3595
02:56:56,161 --> 02:56:58,170
powerful,
even if you're,

3596
02:56:58,200 --> 02:56:59,280
even if it's your own voice.
I mean,

3597
02:56:59,281 --> 02:57:03,690
even when I'm listening to a meditation 
that I recorded,

3598
02:57:04,290 --> 02:57:07,590
just my own voice,
remember it reminded me that I'm,

3599
02:57:08,010 --> 02:57:12,060
that I'm supposed to be meditating.
It works like any other voice,

3600
02:57:12,120 --> 02:57:13,640
you know,
and it's um,

3601
02:57:14,390 --> 02:57:15,260
so it's,
it's just,

3602
02:57:15,350 --> 02:57:19,440
it's a feedback system that you can't 
really provide for yourself,

3603
02:57:19,441 --> 02:57:20,730
although you,
obviously you can,

3604
02:57:20,890 --> 02:57:23,880
I mean,
you can meditate without an app and most

3605
02:57:23,881 --> 02:57:24,870
people do.
I mean,

3606
02:57:26,310 --> 02:57:28,560
I've spent very little time meditating 
with apps.

3607
02:57:28,920 --> 02:57:30,300
I just think they're very useful.

3608
02:57:30,380 --> 02:57:32,540
But you see,
both of us started meditating.

3609
02:57:32,541 --> 02:57:36,870
I started meditating well before I did,
but we both started pre worn around.

3610
02:57:36,900 --> 02:57:38,850
Um,
uh,

3611
02:57:39,710 --> 02:57:41,000
so the,
you can read,

3612
02:57:41,001 --> 02:57:46,001
you can read a book,
read a good book and learn how to 

3613
02:57:46,001 --> 02:57:48,461
meditate out of the book and just 
basically remember the basic 

3614
02:57:48,461 --> 02:57:49,410
instructions and do it.
Uh,

3615
02:57:49,610 --> 02:57:54,610
but a really is useful to have an APP,
especially for some people because one 

3616
02:57:54,610 --> 02:57:59,021
of the biggest problems in meditation is
this persistent fear that you're not 

3617
02:57:59,021 --> 02:58:02,591
doing it right.
And so to have a voice you in your ear 

3618
02:58:03,060 --> 02:58:08,060
just giving you,
reminding you of the basic instructions 

3619
02:58:08,060 --> 02:58:08,850
which are so simple but very easy to 
forget.

3620
02:58:09,330 --> 02:58:10,290
It can be very useful.

3621
02:58:10,900 --> 02:58:15,010
I like the idea of it being like bicep 
curls for your mind.

3622
02:58:15,040 --> 02:58:15,240
Yeah,

3623
02:58:16,010 --> 02:58:17,300
I mean,
you see,

3624
02:58:17,870 --> 02:58:22,870
you see it in the brain scans and no 
Samuel correct me where I run a foul of 

3625
02:58:22,870 --> 02:58:27,200
scientific accuracy here,
but this base,

3626
02:58:27,300 --> 02:58:30,920
this,
this simple act of sitting,

3627
02:58:31,700 --> 02:58:33,830
trying,
trying to focus on one thing at a time.

3628
02:58:33,831 --> 02:58:38,831
And then when you get distracted knowing
you're distracted and returning to your 

3629
02:58:38,831 --> 02:58:41,480
breath is changing your brain.
When you do that,

3630
02:58:41,540 --> 02:58:44,300
you're boosting a,
the muscles.

3631
02:58:44,570 --> 02:58:47,210
Uh,
the obviously the muscles.

3632
02:58:47,211 --> 02:58:50,000
I'm using a,
a light loosely.

3633
02:58:50,240 --> 02:58:53,420
You're boosting your focus muscle and in
many cases,

3634
02:58:53,690 --> 02:58:56,390
whether there was a study in 2010,
I think it was done at Harvard,

3635
02:58:56,640 --> 02:58:57,410
uh,
that took,

3636
02:58:57,411 --> 02:59:02,411
people would never meditated before and 
they scanned their brains and then they 

3637
02:59:02,411 --> 02:59:02,600
had them do eight weeks of a,
I think,

3638
02:59:02,601 --> 02:59:07,601
a half hour a day of meditation.
The end of the eight weeks they scanned 

3639
02:59:07,601 --> 02:59:10,181
their brains again.
What they found was in the area of the 

3640
02:59:10,181 --> 02:59:10,760
brain associated with self awareness,
the gray matter group,

3641
02:59:11,060 --> 02:59:13,280
and in the area of the brain associated 
with stress,

3642
02:59:13,460 --> 02:59:16,430
the gray matter shrink.
That to me is pretty compelling.

3643
02:59:16,880 --> 02:59:19,710
That is beautiful.
Gentlemen.

3644
02:59:19,750 --> 02:59:20,930
We just did three hours.
Wow.

3645
02:59:21,050 --> 02:59:22,130
Wow.
Flew by.

3646
02:59:22,190 --> 02:59:22,700
Yes,
it did.

3647
02:59:22,740 --> 02:59:23,960
Yes.
Thank you very much.

3648
02:59:23,961 --> 02:59:24,830
Thank you.
My pleasure.

3649
02:59:27,690 --> 02:59:28,760
All right,
everybody.

3650
02:59:28,790 --> 02:59:31,010
That's it.
Go do something else.

3651
02:59:44,170 --> 02:59:45,470
No.
