1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:00,800
Hmm,

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:05,800
the countdown?
Sure.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,880
So you were just two.
One.

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:09,710
Hello?
Peter Schiff.

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,400
Hello Joe.
You just what we're going to,

6
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:16,500
we're going to ask.
You just did a whole other show before 

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:16,500
this one.
I did three hours.

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,180
No,
two hours.

9
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:17,920
Oh,
alright.

10
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:18,880
So it's not hard.
Oh,

11
00:00:18,881 --> 00:00:19,970
okay.
Well the comedian,

12
00:00:19,971 --> 00:00:21,070
those are the easy ones.
Oh,

13
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:23,570
all right.
It's just basically talking to a friend.

14
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:24,860
Okay.
Well I'm a friend.

15
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:26,180
You are a friend.
That's right.

16
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,610
Yeah.
I remember when I first saw you when you

17
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:31,340
were doing that octopus is occupied Wall
Street thing anymore.

18
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,080
Did they give up?
They stop occupying?

19
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:34,040
Yeah,
they did.

20
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:34,910
But you know,
we just.

21
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,100
Maybe you saw that on my youtube 
channel.

22
00:00:37,101 --> 00:00:40,550
I know we just reposting the occupy Wall
Street video.

23
00:00:40,551 --> 00:00:42,910
I never actually had it on my channel.
Oh really?

24
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,820
But because it was originally done by 
reason this about five years ago or so,

25
00:00:46,821 --> 00:00:51,821
five,
six years ago and so reason tv did it 

26
00:00:51,821 --> 00:00:52,100
and so I let them promote it on their 
site.

27
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:55,100
I didn't copy it and they got millions 
and millions of views and there was some

28
00:00:55,101 --> 00:00:59,680
other sites that that that went with it.
It was asking a one percenter,

29
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:01,100
right?
Wasn't that what you called it?

30
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:04,730
Well,
I was down there with a sign that said I

31
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,380
am the one percent.
Let's talk,

32
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:11,860
and I went into Zucotti Park and the 
only reason I stopped that if you the 

33
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:12,740
long,
the long one,

34
00:01:12,741 --> 00:01:14,600
the long version is just under two 
hours,

35
00:01:14,601 --> 00:01:19,601
which is on my youtube channel now,
but the other reason we stopped is 

36
00:01:19,601 --> 00:01:21,710
because we ran out a ca,
a candidate batteries,

37
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,420
batteries in the camera.
The camera died,

38
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,120
but I could have kept talking and we 
were losing the light.

39
00:01:26,121 --> 00:01:27,880
You can see by the end,
you know it's getting dark.

40
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:30,740
It's getting darker.
Swatching them get frustrated with you,

41
00:01:30,741 --> 00:01:35,741
but not having the words nor the 
knowledge to compete with what you were 

42
00:01:35,741 --> 00:01:39,401
saying was very entertaining,
like agree with you or disagree with 

43
00:01:39,401 --> 00:01:39,401
you.

44
00:01:39,401 --> 00:01:43,210
It was just hilarious watching someone 
so completely outmatched or a group of 

45
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:47,291
people,
so completely outmatched trying to 

46
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:47,300
debate economics with you and trying to 
understand the way business works,

47
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,690
except they didn't even realize they 
were out match.

48
00:01:49,691 --> 00:01:51,980
They thought they were smarter than me,
but you know,

49
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,240
the,
the main reason I went there was not so 

50
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,120
much to try to convince the people there
that they were wrong and that,

51
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,530
you know,
capitalism was,

52
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,520
you know,
the solution,

53
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:06,521
not the source of their problems and 
that they should be protesting 

54
00:02:06,521 --> 00:02:07,430
Washington,
the Federal Reserve or Congress.

55
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:12,700
It was for the people that I knew that 
would watch it on the internet and I 

56
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:16,871
still get emails even now at least I 
don't think a week goes by where 

57
00:02:16,871 --> 00:02:20,810
somebody from somewhere in the world 
doesn't send me an email about that.

58
00:02:20,811 --> 00:02:24,020
And I know another website,
I forget the name of it,

59
00:02:24,021 --> 00:02:27,410
re posted it about a year ago and they 
got a couple of million views on it.

60
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:31,310
Just posting it again.
So a lot of people have watched it and I

61
00:02:31,311 --> 00:02:34,550
get comments from people saying,
this is what changed me.

62
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,370
I was socialist,
very left wing.

63
00:02:37,371 --> 00:02:39,500
I watched this and that was the 
epiphany.

64
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,680
That was the moment,
and then I did more research and I 

65
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,051
learned more and now thanks to you,
I'm a total libertarian or free market 

66
00:02:47,051 --> 00:02:48,560
capitalist and so it's served its 
purpose.

67
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,510
Yeah,
well it was enlightening.

68
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:55,830
It was good.
It's good to see people that are so 

69
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:58,070
involved in something that they'll go 
and they'll protest will hang out in the

70
00:02:58,071 --> 00:03:00,610
park,
but they can't articulate their feelings

71
00:03:00,611 --> 00:03:03,790
or their thoughts in a well reasoned 
debate.

72
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:09,060
They really don't have the facts,
but yet they're dedicating their entire 

73
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,120
life to protesting something.
It's really interesting that people will

74
00:03:10,121 --> 00:03:15,121
spend so much energy and effort on 
something that they're really not even 

75
00:03:15,121 --> 00:03:15,121
educated.

76
00:03:15,121 --> 00:03:16,900
Yeah,
and it's a lot easier just to talk about

77
00:03:16,901 --> 00:03:21,901
something just emotionally instead of 
actually taking the time to learn about 

78
00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:26,430
economics and to understand,
you know,

79
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:30,070
the source of the problems because 
anybody could just blame it on some rich

80
00:03:30,071 --> 00:03:32,930
person who's hoarding money and 
discriminating.

81
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,560
They loved doing that and then just say,
oh,

82
00:03:35,561 --> 00:03:40,561
this solution,
see if you blame the problems on some 

83
00:03:40,561 --> 00:03:40,561
rich person.
Well,

84
00:03:40,561 --> 00:03:41,140
the solution is easy,
just take his money,

85
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,910
right,
have the government come in and,

86
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:46,720
and redistribute the wealth,
which is another word for steel.

87
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:49,930
Take money from somebody who earned it 
and give it to somebody who didn't,

88
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:54,730
but if you actually take a little bit of
time and use your head instead of your,

89
00:03:54,731 --> 00:03:55,180
your,
your,

90
00:03:55,181 --> 00:03:56,320
your,
your heart,

91
00:03:56,321 --> 00:03:57,670
your feelings,
uh,

92
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:02,730
you'll learn that you know,
that the source of the problems is 

93
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:05,971
government interference in the economy 
and that the protest should be directed 

94
00:04:06,311 --> 00:04:09,550
at government,
at their regulations and their subsidies

95
00:04:09,551 --> 00:04:14,551
and their taxes and all the things that 
government does to stifle economic 

96
00:04:14,551 --> 00:04:16,240
growth and deny opportunities to people.

97
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,120
I think that would be a really funny 
documentary if you could do like a 

98
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,521
documentary on the last occupier,
like the last person to occupy Wall 

99
00:04:26,521 --> 00:04:28,570
Street because they had to be like 
stragglers,

100
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,660
right?
Eventually must have gotten to the point

101
00:04:31,661 --> 00:04:35,050
where there was like 30 people left,
20 people left that one guy,

102
00:04:35,051 --> 00:04:36,350
no,
fuck these people man.

103
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,820
They started occupying different areas,
right?

104
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,860
Because it caught on and it was all over
the world.

105
00:04:41,861 --> 00:04:45,310
They were occupying here and occupying 
there and they were setting up camps.

106
00:04:45,311 --> 00:04:46,540
Right?
They're essentially living there.

107
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:47,470
Yeah.
Yeah.

108
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:52,650
And um,
who knows what else they were doing 

109
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:52,650
there,
but um,

110
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:55,860
but now the occupy a movement kind of 
morphed into the Bernie Sanders 

111
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:55,860
Movement,
right?

112
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:56,890
Because that's where all those guys are 
now.

113
00:04:56,891 --> 00:05:01,550
They were volunteering for the sanders 
campaign and socialism is really kind of

114
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:06,570
going mainstream now because they put 
the word Democrat in front of it as if 

115
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:06,790
somehow that changes the meeting.

116
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:08,200
Right.
I'm not a socialist.

117
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:13,380
I'm a democratic socialist.
Meaning I want to vote for socialism as 

118
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,680
opposed to just have an armed 
revolution.

119
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:16,720
But the end is still the same.
Right.

120
00:05:16,721 --> 00:05:18,820
It's still a socialism and it doesn't 
work.

121
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:24,030
Yeah.
I was watching an interview with Tucker 

122
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:24,370
Carlson and some guidance,
a professor at Harvard and he said,

123
00:05:24,371 --> 00:05:26,950
I'll give you the last word you guys 
said socialism is gonna win.

124
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,440
I made the piece on like,
what is that?

125
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:32,920
What does that even mean?
Like socialism is going to win.

126
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,330
What is it?
What does that mean?

127
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:37,360
What is socialism?
But it could win at the polls.

128
00:05:37,361 --> 00:05:42,361
That's the problem.
It's very intoxicating to people who 

129
00:05:42,361 --> 00:05:43,290
don't know any better,
and the interesting thing people,

130
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,210
they have too much money.
The interesting thing about socialism is

131
00:05:46,211 --> 00:05:49,930
that no matter how many times it fails,
people expect it to succeed,

132
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,330
right?
That's the definition of insanity,

133
00:05:52,331 --> 00:05:57,331
right?
Doing something over and over again and 

134
00:05:57,331 --> 00:05:57,331
expecting a different result.
Well,

135
00:05:57,331 --> 00:05:58,010
the Socialists always expect a

136
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:00,990
different result from doing something 
that has never succeeded in

137
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:04,110
pass.
So socialism by definition is one thing,

138
00:06:04,111 --> 00:06:07,710
but by the emotional reaction that 
people have is kind of another thing.

139
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:11,520
The emotional reaction is there's rich 
people that are a real problem.

140
00:06:11,521 --> 00:06:15,540
They're hoarding their greedy.
I'm not concerned with money.

141
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:20,541
I want.
I'm concerned with people and community 

142
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:23,850
and feelings and health and welfare and 
education and all of that money.

143
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:28,851
We should take it from those rich people
and we should funnel it into education 

144
00:06:28,851 --> 00:06:33,051
and community.
And they say all these words that make 

145
00:06:33,051 --> 00:06:33,051
people feel good.
Like,

146
00:06:33,051 --> 00:06:33,420
yeah,
we're not about money either.

147
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,820
It's all about feeling good.
That's what the liberals are about.

148
00:06:37,821 --> 00:06:40,850
It's about feeling that they're better 
than everybody else because they're,

149
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:41,440
you know,
they're,

150
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:45,410
they're higher up on this moral pedestal
because they don't care about money,

151
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,140
they just care about,
you know,

152
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:50,360
people and you know,
but when you talk about rich people,

153
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,980
they don't hoard money.
I mean,

154
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:57,010
the way you get rich is not by hoarding.
The way you get rich is by trying to 

155
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:59,060
figure out what problems people have 
that you can solve,

156
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:04,090
right?
Whether it's inventing something that 

157
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,311
makes their lives better or providing a 
service that makes their lives better 

158
00:07:06,311 --> 00:07:08,240
because the customers are in charge 
individuals,

159
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,680
right?
That that's what's gonna.

160
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,540
Allocate wealth.
It's if,

161
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:16,560
if somebody is better than somebody else
at satisfying the desires that people 

162
00:07:17,331 --> 00:07:17,960
have,
right?

163
00:07:17,961 --> 00:07:20,240
If,
if I can come up with something that you

164
00:07:20,241 --> 00:07:25,241
like,
that you want to buy that's cheaper and 

165
00:07:25,241 --> 00:07:25,241
better than what somebody else has come 
up with,

166
00:07:25,241 --> 00:07:26,390
then you're going to buy from me.

167
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:30,560
And so the person who ends up with the 
most money is the person who's satisfied

168
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:34,280
the most desires,
the most needs in the most efficient way

169
00:07:34,281 --> 00:07:37,040
possible.
And that's what's benefiting society.

170
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:42,041
I mean,
it's great to have charity and I'm all 

171
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:42,230
for private charity,
but if you look at the wealthiest men in

172
00:07:42,231 --> 00:07:47,231
history,
even though they've been incredible 

173
00:07:47,231 --> 00:07:47,231
philanthropists and they've given away a
lot of money,

174
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:52,300
they helped a lot more people,
a massing their fortunes than gifting 

175
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,010
away what they made.
It was the businesses that they created,

176
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:55,850
the,
the,

177
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,870
the products that they invented,
the services that they provided,

178
00:07:59,871 --> 00:08:01,070
and the employment,
right?

179
00:08:01,071 --> 00:08:04,010
That was all a function of they're 
creating their wealth.

180
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:09,220
That's what did a lot more to help 
society than simply giving away some of 

181
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:13,721
the money that they earned.
Have you ever had a debate with a 

182
00:08:13,721 --> 00:08:13,721
democratic socialist?
Well,

183
00:08:13,721 --> 00:08:15,290
I mean,
most Democrats are socialists.

184
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:17,420
They just don't know it or they don't 
want to admit it,

185
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:20,870
and a lot of people don't even 
understand what socialism is because you

186
00:08:20,871 --> 00:08:22,130
know,
you'll have the left.

187
00:08:22,131 --> 00:08:24,650
I'll always consider somebody like even 
Donald Trump,

188
00:08:24,651 --> 00:08:24,980
they'll say,
oh,

189
00:08:24,981 --> 00:08:26,030
he's a fascist.
Right?

190
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:30,320
They don't even realize that fascism is 
part of socialism.

191
00:08:30,321 --> 00:08:35,321
Socialism is a broad concept that 
includes things like Communism and 

192
00:08:35,321 --> 00:08:37,160
fascism.
So if you're a communist,

193
00:08:37,161 --> 00:08:39,080
you are a socialist.
But by,

194
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:42,650
but it doesn't mean that if you're a 
socialist or communist because you could

195
00:08:42,651 --> 00:08:44,480
be the fastest,
you could be for a lot of things,

196
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,720
but fascism is a form of socialism where
the government doesn't just steal all 

197
00:08:50,421 --> 00:08:55,421
the property,
like the communists want to nationalize 

198
00:08:55,421 --> 00:08:57,120
everything and take legal ownership of 
the means of production.

199
00:08:57,121 --> 00:08:58,950
Right?
The government just owns all the capital

200
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,990
under,
under fascism,

201
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:03,330
but government is a little bit smarter.

202
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:08,570
They,
they realize that people will work 

203
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:08,570
harder if they think they're working for
themselves.

204
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:11,040
So the fastest doesn't want to 
nationalize businesses,

205
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:13,860
they just want to control it through 
regulation and taxes.

206
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,230
And that's pretty much what the 
Democrats want to do.

207
00:09:16,231 --> 00:09:20,250
They want to control everything by 
taxing it heavily and regulating it.

208
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,060
And those,
that's an important aspect of fascist.

209
00:09:23,061 --> 00:09:28,061
I mean a lot of people associate fascism
with racism just because the Nazis were 

210
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,090
racist,
but you don't have to be racist.

211
00:09:30,091 --> 00:09:35,091
I mean,
fascism started in Italy and that there 

212
00:09:35,091 --> 00:09:37,680
wasn't any racism there.
And if you go back to the Nazi party,

213
00:09:37,681 --> 00:09:40,290
it's the National Socialist Party of 
Germany.

214
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:42,450
That's what the Nazis are.
It's socialist.

215
00:09:42,451 --> 00:09:47,451
So fascism is a form of social and 
that's why the communists and the 

216
00:09:47,451 --> 00:09:47,451
fascists,
you know,

217
00:09:47,451 --> 00:09:50,970
are you so much because they're really,
they're fighting over the same turf.

218
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:55,680
It's which brand of socialism is better,
fascism or communism,

219
00:09:55,681 --> 00:09:58,440
but they're not at opposite ends of the 
political spectrum.

220
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,450
They're on the same end.
So do you think

221
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:05,580
people are frustrated with the current 
system and so they see someone like 

222
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,790
Bernie Sanders come along that offers 
this radical change of pace.

223
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:07,630
He saying,
you know,

224
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:12,640
we need to end income inequality and 
redistribute wealth and all these 

225
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:17,431
different things and it just sparks a,
an emotional reaction in people that 

226
00:10:17,441 --> 00:10:19,900
they know that the current system,
the way it's in place,

227
00:10:19,901 --> 00:10:23,080
especially the way it was under Obama,
they didn't like how things were that in

228
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:28,081
like how things were under Bush.
They think we need someone who's not a 

229
00:10:28,081 --> 00:10:29,110
career politician or someone who has got
a radical new approach.

230
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,410
Oh look at this Bernie Sanders guy.
He wants to do some stuff with money.

231
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,730
Let's vote for him.

232
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:34,430
Yeah,
look,

233
00:10:34,431 --> 00:10:39,431
people are grasping for straws when 
they're looking for a solution that 

234
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:40,590
that's why trump is president.
I mean,

235
00:10:40,591 --> 00:10:44,940
a lot of people think that trump's 
election maybe shows that the UK,

236
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:47,030
the US electorate has moved,
right?

237
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:52,150
Right.
That were more republican or more free 

238
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:54,911
market,
but that's not what that election was 

239
00:10:54,911 --> 00:10:57,911
about.
It was about the fact that we had a 

240
00:10:57,911 --> 00:10:58,730
lousy economy and trump was honest about
that too.

241
00:10:58,731 --> 00:11:03,731
The voters,
trump told people that the numbers are 

242
00:11:03,731 --> 00:11:06,761
phony.
Don't believe these unemployment 

243
00:11:06,761 --> 00:11:06,761
numbers,
four or five percent.

244
00:11:06,761 --> 00:11:07,160
It's a lie.
It's fraud,

245
00:11:07,161 --> 00:11:12,161
it's fiction.
And he was right because the way they 

246
00:11:12,161 --> 00:11:12,161
calculated today,
they don't calculate that.

247
00:11:12,161 --> 00:11:15,170
Millions and millions of people who I've
given up looking for work,

248
00:11:15,171 --> 00:11:20,171
right?
They don't count the people who just 

249
00:11:20,171 --> 00:11:20,171
have a part time job and they're still 
looking for a full time job.

250
00:11:20,171 --> 00:11:22,550
So the real unemployment number is much,
much higher.

251
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:24,200
And,
and trump talked about that and,

252
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,670
and he called out,
you know,

253
00:11:25,671 --> 00:11:27,880
all the politicians from both sides,
right?

254
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:30,650
Not just the Democrats to Republicans.
And he said,

255
00:11:30,651 --> 00:11:31,910
look,
I'm going to clean house.

256
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:34,040
I'm not a politician.
Vote for me,

257
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,810
right?
I'm going to make America great again.

258
00:11:35,811 --> 00:11:37,660
I'm going to drain the swamp,
you know,

259
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,430
and he appealed to people's,
uh,

260
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:40,130
you know,
their,

261
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,990
their,
their fears about immigrants.

262
00:11:41,991 --> 00:11:45,560
I'm going to build this wall as if the 
reason that things are bad is because we

263
00:11:45,561 --> 00:11:47,690
have too many immigrants taking away the
jobs.

264
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,190
And so people decided,
you know,

265
00:11:49,191 --> 00:11:50,480
what the hell,
let me,

266
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,910
let me give this guy a trance because 
things are.

267
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,930
The media is lying to me.
Wall Street's lined to me.

268
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,080
And so,
you know,

269
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,060
trump,
trump won.

270
00:11:58,061 --> 00:12:03,061
But unfortunately now trump is part of 
the establishment and now all of a 

271
00:12:03,491 --> 00:12:06,460
sudden the fake economic numbers are 
legit.

272
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,620
Now every time there was an unemployment
number out,

273
00:12:08,621 --> 00:12:10,810
he tweets about how it's the lowest it's
ever been.

274
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:15,070
So I think that when we get this next 
recession,

275
00:12:15,071 --> 00:12:18,400
which is going to happen while trump is 
president during,

276
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:20,950
during this first term,
which I think will be the only term,

277
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,100
but when all the why do you think those 
two things?

278
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:29,280
Well,
because I think the economy is going to 

279
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,140
fall into a severe recession.
What makes you say the well a,

280
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:30,940
you know,
it's,

281
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,140
we're overdue,
right?

282
00:12:32,141 --> 00:12:37,141
I mean,
you don't normally have an expansion 

283
00:12:37,141 --> 00:12:37,141
that lasts as long as this one.
I think that we're,

284
00:12:37,141 --> 00:12:40,981
uh,
we're the second longest in history and 

285
00:12:40,981 --> 00:12:40,981
I,
if we go for another year,

286
00:12:40,981 --> 00:12:41,440
it will be the longest expansion in 
history.

287
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:46,470
Two thousand eight is when it started to
turn around to the end is kind of the 

288
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:51,211
end of 2009 years in exactly what is a 
usual expansion and compression

289
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,900
out of five,
six years.

290
00:12:52,901 --> 00:12:54,520
So,
so this one is long,

291
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:59,610
but it also,
this one required more government 

292
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:00,010
stimulus than any other,
you know,

293
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:03,040
recovery.
And I don't think we actually recovered.

294
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:08,041
I think the government simply injected a
bunch of cheap money into the economy 

295
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:10,740
and exacerbated the real problems.
But you know,

296
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:14,320
reflated the bubbles in the stock market
and the housing market.

297
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,390
But you know,
everybody talks about how the economy is

298
00:13:16,391 --> 00:13:21,391
doing so great,
but it's really not much better than it 

299
00:13:21,391 --> 00:13:21,391
was under Obama.
If it's any better at all.

300
00:13:21,391 --> 00:13:24,220
And we GDP growth for trump's first year
in office.

301
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:26,220
Last year was two point three percent,
I mean,

302
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:28,510
nothing great.
First quarter was two percent,

303
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,000
this quarter might be a better than 
three,

304
00:13:31,001 --> 00:13:31,870
maybe,
maybe not,

305
00:13:31,871 --> 00:13:36,871
but I mean,
I think it's going to be the second 

306
00:13:36,871 --> 00:13:36,871
quarter will probably be the best 
quarter of the year.

307
00:13:36,871 --> 00:13:37,810
Maybe we're probably going to go 
downhill,

308
00:13:37,811 --> 00:13:42,811
but you know,
last year was I think the weakest year 

309
00:13:42,811 --> 00:13:42,811
of job growth since 2011.

310
00:13:42,811 --> 00:13:45,160
So people want to talk about how great 
everything is,

311
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:49,210
but it's more a function of people are 
hoping things are going to turn around.

312
00:13:49,211 --> 00:13:51,880
There's a lot of optimism now that 
things are going to get better.

313
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:54,250
But I think that the people who are so 
optimistic,

314
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:56,270
a lot of them are going to be 
disappointed because we're,

315
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:58,600
we're going to end up with is a weaker 
economy.

316
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,890
The only thing that's really 
strengthening is inflation.

317
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:04,330
Inflation is going to pick up.
So the cost of living is really going to

318
00:14:04,331 --> 00:14:07,510
be rising as the economy is falling into
recession.

319
00:14:07,511 --> 00:14:09,610
So we get stagflation,
uh,

320
00:14:09,611 --> 00:14:13,360
which is probably the worst possible 
economic scenario.

321
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,420
And you know,
I think that the,

322
00:14:16,421 --> 00:14:19,450
uh,
the left and even the Fed is going to be

323
00:14:19,451 --> 00:14:24,451
able to blame it on trump because trump 
has come in and claim credit for this 

324
00:14:24,451 --> 00:14:29,340
great economy that he believes we have 
and he's claimed credit for the record 

325
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:33,180
in the stock market,
but he's basically put his name on a 

326
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:33,180
bubble and when it pops,
you know,

327
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:37,920
it's going to be hard for him to try to 
blame the next recession on Obama when 

328
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:37,920
he's already said,
hey,

329
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,980
this is my economy.

330
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:44,190
I created it.
And so people are going to be 

331
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,570
disappointed and they're going to vote,
I think for a,

332
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:51,180
another person whose promises change and
unfortunately that's going to come from 

333
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,040
the left.
So you think this is going to

334
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,380
happen in the next three years?
Well,

335
00:14:54,381 --> 00:14:55,140
yeah,
I mean,

336
00:14:55,210 --> 00:15:00,210
one is what is the bubble?
What do you think is going to cause it 

337
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:00,320
to crash commercial real estate?
Is it credit?

338
00:15:00,321 --> 00:15:01,220
What is it?
Well,

339
00:15:01,221 --> 00:15:06,221
I mean,
commercial real estate is expensive 

340
00:15:06,221 --> 00:15:06,221
being it's in a bubble,
but that,

341
00:15:06,221 --> 00:15:06,221
you know,
that's not going to cause it.

342
00:15:06,221 --> 00:15:07,520
I mean going gonna come out of the 
bubble.

343
00:15:07,521 --> 00:15:11,630
I think we would already be in a pretty 
severe recession now,

344
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:14,990
had it not been for trump winning had 
hillary won.

345
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:18,020
I think we'd already be there.
But I think that makes you say that.

346
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:23,080
Well,
we got a lot of false optimism as a 

347
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:23,080
result of,
of trump.

348
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,280
And we did get the tax cuts and the tax 
cuts,

349
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:27,830
you know,
just like any kind of artificial drug,

350
00:15:27,831 --> 00:15:29,820
you know,
you can inject yourself and,

351
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:31,790
and get a little bit of a phony high.

352
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:36,500
Because remember the tax cuts were paid 
for with debt.

353
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:38,630
We didn't shrink government,
right?

354
00:15:38,631 --> 00:15:40,640
If you,
if you make government smaller,

355
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:45,880
that's great.
Then you can cut taxes because now 

356
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:45,880
government doesn't need as much money 
and you can,

357
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:50,350
you know,
you can relieve the taxpayer of the 

358
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:50,350
burden of paying for it and that's 
great.

359
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,970
But if you just cut taxes but you don't 
cut government spending.

360
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,320
And of course what the trump 
administration did was,

361
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:58,070
was even worse,
they increased government spending.

362
00:15:58,071 --> 00:16:01,460
We increased welfare spending,
we increased warfare spending.

363
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,830
Uh,
and so spending is more,

364
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,920
but they reduced their tax revenue so 
the deficits are just exploding out of 

365
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,020
control and those deficits are going to 
do more damage to the economy.

366
00:16:12,021 --> 00:16:15,680
Then the tax cuts were benefit,
except you get the benefit first,

367
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:19,670
maybe for the first year and then you 
start to deal with the pain after that.

368
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:22,070
And so I think that's going to set in a,
you know,

369
00:16:22,071 --> 00:16:27,071
long before the end of trump's term.
So you think that this is what is 

370
00:16:27,071 --> 00:16:30,620
causing the economy to be in a really,
at least a two to look like.

371
00:16:30,621 --> 00:16:31,940
It's in a really healthy state right 
now.

372
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:33,980
Well,
some of the numbers,

373
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,870
right?
Some of the numbers look better,

374
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:38,270
but beneath the surface,
again,

375
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,920
it's not improving,
just like,

376
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:41,960
just like it wasn't improving under 
Obama.

377
00:16:41,961 --> 00:16:46,961
That's what laid the foundation for 
trump's victory was because obama and 

378
00:16:46,961 --> 00:16:49,310
everybody kept talking about how great 
the recovery was,

379
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:54,490
but the average voter knew that that was
all a bunch of nonsense because he 

380
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:58,121
wasn't living in that reality.
So if you were the financial advisor to 

381
00:16:58,551 --> 00:17:00,680
the president,
what would you tell him?

382
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:06,340
How would you,
what would you do to try to keep the 

383
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:08,870
economy moving in the same direction?
Is it possible to ward off any kind of a

384
00:17:08,871 --> 00:17:09,200
crash?

385
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:14,200
Right.
And we don't want to keep it moving in 

386
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:14,200
the same direction.
I mean it's in the same direction it was

387
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,210
going in before trump came in and that's
towards the edge of a cliff.

388
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,530
I mean,
so what we do,

389
00:17:18,531 --> 00:17:22,520
we need is an about face and trump is 
not doing that.

390
00:17:22,521 --> 00:17:27,521
I mean about face.
So like for the people that are 

391
00:17:27,521 --> 00:17:27,620
listening to this that don't understand,
like they're saying,

392
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:32,650
okay,
your comedy is supposed to be doing 

393
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:34,361
well.
A black unemployment is the lowest it's 

394
00:17:34,361 --> 00:17:34,361
ever been on.
Unemployment is down.

395
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:37,610
All these jobs have been created.
Yeah.

396
00:17:37,611 --> 00:17:42,611
Well remember again,
the unemployment rate is mainly down 

397
00:17:42,611 --> 00:17:44,330
because so many people that are 
unemployed are no longer counted as part

398
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:46,810
of the statistics.
So you know that that's.

399
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:50,190
If you look at the labor force 
participation rate near record,

400
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:55,190
low mean certainly for men it's the 
lowest and spending in the history of 

401
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:55,500
the republic,
but.

402
00:17:55,590 --> 00:18:00,590
And look at the workers to population.
So fewer and fewer people are actually 

403
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:05,001
working and more and more of the people 
who aren't working are not included in 

404
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:09,651
the unemployment statistics.
So if you backed all those people in 

405
00:18:09,651 --> 00:18:13,020
right,
able bodied people who don't have jobs 

406
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:13,290
but should be working,
then the unemployment rate is much,

407
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:16,680
much higher so that that doesn't really 
paint a good picture.

408
00:18:16,681 --> 00:18:17,010
And then,
you know,

409
00:18:17,011 --> 00:18:20,700
you look at the fact that so many 
Americans are unqualified,

410
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:25,940
right?
There's a lot of jobs out there that go 

411
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,741
unfilled because American workers aren't
qualified to fill those positions 

412
00:18:27,741 --> 00:18:28,380
because,
you know,

413
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,480
we,
we take a lot of our kids and we keep 

414
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,620
them in high school until they're 18,
19 years old.

415
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:38,190
Many of these kids should drop out of 
high school and learn a trade.

416
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,420
I mean,
a lot of people,

417
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:44,570
you know,
they don't have the aptitude for 

418
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:46,880
academics.
There's no point in just being in high 

419
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,040
school.
A lot of times they're glorified daycare

420
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:49,560
centers,
but they should be out learning trades.

421
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:54,561
And of course we make it harder for 
employers to train people on the job 

422
00:18:54,561 --> 00:18:56,580
with occupational licensing laws and 
minimum wage laws.

423
00:18:56,730 --> 00:19:01,730
So we destroy a lot of the opportunities
for younger kids to get skills and then 

424
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:03,840
the ones that we send the college,
they waste their time,

425
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,580
you know,
majoring in liberal arts.

426
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:09,300
So they spend four or five,
six years in college learning nothing of

427
00:19:09,301 --> 00:19:13,140
any real value in the market.
They accumulate a massive amount of debt

428
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:14,580
in the process.
And so,

429
00:19:14,581 --> 00:19:19,581
you know,
we have a labor force that's highly 

430
00:19:19,581 --> 00:19:19,581
educated and that they've got a bunch of
degrees,

431
00:19:19,581 --> 00:19:21,540
maybe they didn't learn anything but 
they got a piece of paper,

432
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:23,340
but then what they have is a lot of 
debt.

433
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,670
And so we don't have a lot of people 
qualified to do a lot of the things that

434
00:19:26,671 --> 00:19:31,671
need to be done.
So what would you tell the president if 

435
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:31,671
you were,
if you said,

436
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:32,130
look,
Peter Schiff,

437
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:34,260
uh,
I don't know shit about the economy.

438
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,830
You obviously do help me out.
How do I stop this bubble?

439
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,360
Well,
first of all,

440
00:19:39,361 --> 00:19:41,190
you can't stop it.
You got to let it deflate.

441
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:46,280
But the question is how does it deflate?
And then what do you propose as the 

442
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:46,280
solution?
See,

443
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,950
the problem that trump already made was 
when he first got elected,

444
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:53,400
he should not have changed his 
perspective.

445
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:54,480
He shouldn't have said,
hey,

446
00:19:54,481 --> 00:19:59,481
everything is great right now.
He's planning on running at his next 

447
00:19:59,481 --> 00:20:00,120
campaign is keep America great.
Right?

448
00:20:00,121 --> 00:20:05,121
When trump ran for office,
he said America was an economic 

449
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:05,370
wasteland,
that it was a disaster.

450
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:07,320
He's been president for a little over a 
year.

451
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,350
All of a sudden it's the greatest 
economy in the history of the country,

452
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:13,500
which is not even close to being true,
but if he's gonna,

453
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:18,530
try to run for reelection on,
I've already made America great and now 

454
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:20,430
we just want to keep it great.
That's not going to resonate.

455
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:24,300
So what he should have done from day one
is leveled with the American public.

456
00:20:24,301 --> 00:20:29,301
Again,
this is how bad the problem is and this 

457
00:20:29,301 --> 00:20:30,390
is what it's gonna take to solve it 
because there's a lot of,

458
00:20:30,391 --> 00:20:35,391
you know,
I'm a pain short term pain that we're 

459
00:20:35,391 --> 00:20:39,111
going to need to go through in order to 
come to the other side in order to get 

460
00:20:39,111 --> 00:20:40,650
rid of all these problems.
Right now,

461
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:41,820
look at the trait,
right?

462
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:45,680
Trump is making a big deal about the 
trade deficits and he's launching,

463
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,510
terrorist is going to have this trade 
that he's convinced that we could win.

464
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:54,960
And this is very misguided.
The trade deficits are not the problem.

465
00:20:56,140 --> 00:21:01,140
They are the consequence of the problem.
The problem is that we have bad monetary

466
00:21:02,951 --> 00:21:05,290
policy,
bad fiscal policy,

467
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:10,440
too much regulation.
That's why we have a trade deficit 

468
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,140
because American industry is not 
productive enough.

469
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:16,380
We don't save enough.
We don't make the right capital 

470
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:19,261
investment.
That's because interest rates have been 

471
00:21:19,261 --> 00:21:19,261
kept too low.
You know,

472
00:21:19,261 --> 00:21:19,500
our tax code,
uh,

473
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:20,840
favors debt,
you know,

474
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:25,920
and we have a lot of regulations that 
make American businesses less 

475
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:30,331
competitive.
And so the result is that we import a 

476
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:30,640
lot of products rather than making them 
ourselves.

477
00:21:30,641 --> 00:21:35,641
And it's not because the other countries
aren't fair or because they have 

478
00:21:35,641 --> 00:21:40,110
terrorists.
Terrorists are very low around the 

479
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:40,110
world.
I mean,

480
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:42,400
there's tariffs are not the problem.
And so if trump is simply going to erect

481
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:47,401
tariffs,
all that's going to do is tax the 

482
00:21:47,401 --> 00:21:50,041
American public because the American 
public has to pay the terrorists 

483
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:50,230
whenever they buy imported products.

484
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:53,920
So this is not going to,
I'm going to turn the economy around,

485
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:55,930
but you know,
trump is right.

486
00:21:55,931 --> 00:21:56,980
He points out that,
well,

487
00:21:56,981 --> 00:22:01,981
you know,
at one point in time America ran on 

488
00:22:01,981 --> 00:22:03,550
terrace,
which is true during the 19th century,

489
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:05,470
the government,
you know,

490
00:22:05,471 --> 00:22:07,660
raised money pro predominately by 
tariffs,

491
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,910
but we didn't have an income tax,
you know.

492
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:14,911
And so this is the irony of it,
the reason we have an income tax today 

493
00:22:14,911 --> 00:22:19,590
is because the populist politicians of 
the day told the American voter,

494
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:23,380
if we can tax the rich with an income 
tax,

495
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:27,580
then we can get rid of terrorists that 
the average person is paying.

496
00:22:27,581 --> 00:22:32,581
So the average person understood that 
terrorists cost them money and the 

497
00:22:32,581 --> 00:22:34,690
politicians said,
let's get rid of these tariffs and let's

498
00:22:34,691 --> 00:22:39,691
just tax the rich.
And the income tax that was originally 

499
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:40,660
proposed really was attacks on the very 
rich.

500
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,850
I mean even doctors and lawyers didn't 
pay it.

501
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:48,030
I mean,
you had to be super rich before you pay 

502
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:48,030
the tax.
And then it was like,

503
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:48,700
you know,
one percent to four percent.

504
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:52,090
So it was a small tax and it wasn't 
taken from your paycheck,

505
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:52,750
right?
I mean,

506
00:22:52,751 --> 00:22:53,170
first of all,
if.

507
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:54,460
Yeah,
if you've got a paycheck,

508
00:22:54,461 --> 00:22:59,461
he didn't pay the tax,
but we didn't have withholding until 

509
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:02,311
1943.
That was part of the victory tax to pay 

510
00:23:02,311 --> 00:23:05,491
for the Second World War.
But Americans were told let's tax the 

511
00:23:05,491 --> 00:23:08,470
rich and you won't have to pay 
terrorists anymore.

512
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:10,020
Well,
it was the minute that you know,

513
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,950
the government got the nose under the 
tent,

514
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:16,980
right?
All of a sudden now the income tax 

515
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:16,980
effects everybody,
right?

516
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:20,161
People pay a lot more in income taxes 
today than they used to pay and 

517
00:23:20,161 --> 00:23:20,380
terrorists.
But now,

518
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:25,060
now the president wants to bring the 
towers back on top of the income tax.

519
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:30,270
I mean,
if trump wants to repeal the income tax 

520
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:30,400
and get rid of it entirely and then have
some terrorists,

521
00:23:30,401 --> 00:23:35,401
I'd be okay with that.
But you can't do that unless you 

522
00:23:35,401 --> 00:23:35,590
dramatically shrink the size of 
government,

523
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:38,440
which is the most important thing to 
trump needs to do.

524
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:41,800
But what he's not doing,
he has to make the military smaller.

525
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:42,910
Not Bigger.
I mean,

526
00:23:42,911 --> 00:23:47,911
he's talking about a space force.
I mean we can't even afford the air 

527
00:23:47,911 --> 00:23:49,160
force navy marines that we got now.
We will be going to make money for space

528
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,320
force,
but we have to cut everything.

529
00:23:51,321 --> 00:23:53,080
We got to cut entitlements,
right?

530
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:55,340
He's think we should be the first people
to have a space for us.

531
00:23:55,370 --> 00:24:00,370
What are the Russians come up with a 
space for us and no one's going to come 

532
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:00,370
out of luck.
What are,

533
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:00,370
what are you going?
What did he do?

534
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:02,180
Is space for it so we can.
Who are going to fight in space?

535
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:05,160
Maybe we fight the Russians is space 
for.

536
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:07,220
Why would we fight them in space?
Their doubt earth?

537
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,900
Well,
maybe they want to fight in space.

538
00:24:08,901 --> 00:24:10,100
It's more novel.
Yeah.

539
00:24:10,101 --> 00:24:12,050
I don't think.
I don't think anybody wants to fight,

540
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,840
right?
Want to be protected,

541
00:24:14,841 --> 00:24:15,200
right?
Yeah.

542
00:24:15,201 --> 00:24:16,970
I,
I think we got that covered.

543
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:19,250
I think we've got a pretty good sized 
military.

544
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,080
I don't think anyone's going to mess 
with us.

545
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,070
The problem is our economy.
So when you say let the bubble crash,

546
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:26,990
like what,
what would that entail?

547
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,760
Well,
basically the problem,

548
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:32,450
the basic problems with the US economy,
and this is because of monetary policy,

549
00:24:32,451 --> 00:24:35,150
fiscal policy is we don't save anything,
right?

550
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:37,370
And because we don't save enough,
we don't invest enough.

551
00:24:37,371 --> 00:24:40,010
We don't produce enough.
We don't make enough real things,

552
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:40,340
right?

553
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:44,450
I mean when trump wants to say that 
foreigners are taking advantage of us by

554
00:24:44,451 --> 00:24:47,480
running these huge trade surpluses,
he's got it backwards.

555
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:51,530
We're taking advantage of them.
They like the Chinese are sending us all

556
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:56,531
these products that they worked hard to 
produce and they had to use real 

557
00:24:56,531 --> 00:24:56,570
resources,
land,

558
00:24:56,571 --> 00:25:01,571
labor capital to make these products and
they send them here and what do we give 

559
00:25:01,571 --> 00:25:01,960
them?
We give them ious,

560
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:04,940
we give him a piece of paper and they 
buy our treasury bonds.

561
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:08,600
So in the short run,
Americans are just putting everything on

562
00:25:08,601 --> 00:25:09,380
a credit card,
right?

563
00:25:09,381 --> 00:25:14,381
We're living a higher standard of living
because we can consume what we didn't 

564
00:25:14,381 --> 00:25:14,900
make.
But when you do that,

565
00:25:14,901 --> 00:25:16,130
you become poorer.
See,

566
00:25:16,131 --> 00:25:18,920
America used to be the richest creditor 
nation in the world,

567
00:25:18,921 --> 00:25:20,600
right?
The world owed us a lot of money.

568
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:23,000
Today we're the world's biggest debtor 
nation.

569
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:26,450
How did we go from being the biggest 
creditor to the biggest debtor?

570
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:31,510
It was trade deficits.
Every year we keep borrowing money to 

571
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:34,301
consume and what this has done is this 
has turned to rich Davidson into a poor 

572
00:25:34,301 --> 00:25:39,011
nation,
but we just don't live like a 

573
00:25:39,011 --> 00:25:39,011
coordination yet because we're still 
borrowing.

574
00:25:39,011 --> 00:25:43,450
Yeah,
and you can be a rich individual yet 

575
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:45,761
maintain a rich lifestyle on debt,
but eventually you know that's going to 

576
00:25:46,671 --> 00:25:49,520
catch up with you and then your 
lifestyle is going to come crashing down

577
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:54,850
and this is what's going to happen,
but what we should do instead of having 

578
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:58,660
a crisis imposed on us globally with a 
crisis and the dollar and a crisis and 

579
00:25:59,211 --> 00:26:01,790
our bond market,
we should do it ourselves.

580
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,820
We should set these forces in motion 
ourselves.

581
00:26:04,821 --> 00:26:06,530
So what we have to do is shrink 
government,

582
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:11,650
right?
We have to cut a lot of government 

583
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:11,650
spending,
get rid a lot of government agencies and

584
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:14,780
departments to get government out of the
way so we can lower taxes legitimately.

585
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:20,200
And then we have to allow the Federal 
Reserve to let the market set interest 

586
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,591
rates.
Interest rates have to be much higher 

587
00:26:23,591 --> 00:26:23,591
than they are now.
Right?

588
00:26:23,591 --> 00:26:23,600
That because that's going to encourage 
people to save.

589
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:28,750
If interest rates are high,
you'll put your money in the bank to 

590
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:29,000
earn that high rate of interest.
When money goes into a bank,

591
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:31,250
it can get loaned out to businesses.
Right now,

592
00:26:31,251 --> 00:26:36,251
all that money is going to government or
it's in the corporate bond market where 

593
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:40,170
it's not growing the economy or the 
money is being used to finance stock buy

594
00:26:40,171 --> 00:26:43,250
backs.
We need money on main street financing,

595
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,330
capital formation,
uh,

596
00:26:45,331 --> 00:26:46,770
entrepreneurship,
you know,

597
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,060
new businesses,
new jobs.

598
00:26:48,061 --> 00:26:50,250
So we get higher interest rates will get
that.

599
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:53,280
And we need people to stop buying things
they can't afford.

600
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,840
You know,
you buy something,

601
00:26:54,841 --> 00:26:57,930
if you have the money to pay for it,
you don't just put it on a credit card,

602
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:03,410
but if and if credit card interest rates
went up and if credit was contracted so 

603
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:05,910
that credit card companies were not 
giving out as much credit,

604
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:11,250
they're giving out a lot of credit now 
because the government is misdirecting 

605
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:11,880
it,
but if we slow down our consumption,

606
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:15,720
we increased our savings and investment,
then the economy can actually grow,

607
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:19,800
but if interest rates go up,
asset prices have to come down.

608
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:24,830
The stock market has to come down a lot.
Real estate prices have to come down a 

609
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:28,311
lot.
Now that means people are going to lose 

610
00:27:28,311 --> 00:27:29,931
money.
They're not going to be happy about 

611
00:27:29,931 --> 00:27:29,931
that.

612
00:27:29,931 --> 00:27:31,780
Yeah.
This sounds counterintuitive to 

613
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:31,780
everything that I've always heard about 
how to boost up the economy.

614
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,380
The idea would be that spending and 
people buying things,

615
00:27:33,381 --> 00:27:35,120
it's great for the economy.
We need more of that.

616
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:35,910
No,
that's

617
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:41,130
put the cart before the horse.
You can't buy something that doesn't 

618
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:44,731
exist.
Something has to be produced before it 

619
00:27:44,731 --> 00:27:47,151
can be consumed.
So it's the production that drives the 

620
00:27:47,151 --> 00:27:47,200
economic trade,
not consumption.

621
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:52,290
See,
right now we're just consuming what the 

622
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:52,290
Chinese produce,
right?

623
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:55,470
But,
but the consumption doesn't mean 

624
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:55,470
anything unless you produce something 
first.

625
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:57,880
So you drive an economy by creating 
supply.

626
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:02,190
It's supply that creates demand.
If you just try to create demand without

627
00:28:02,191 --> 00:28:03,580
the supply,
it's just inflation.

628
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:08,790
It's weird too that we keep hearing 
things about Chinese telecommunications 

629
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:13,411
companies like Walway in particular.
They're always telling you to not buy 

630
00:28:13,411 --> 00:28:13,411
their stuff.
That wasn't there.

631
00:28:13,411 --> 00:28:17,020
There was something about something in 
the paper today about Walway.

632
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:18,400
It was about,
uh,

633
00:28:18,401 --> 00:28:21,450
I think another country saying no to 
these,

634
00:28:21,451 --> 00:28:26,451
uh,
I guess Walway in particular is the 

635
00:28:26,451 --> 00:28:29,350
third largest cell phone manufacturer in
the world and they have a close tie with

636
00:28:29,351 --> 00:28:31,690
the communist government and they 
believe that there's,

637
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:33,910
there might be some shenanigans going on
with them,

638
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:35,530
their electronics.

639
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:36,850
I don't know.
I mean,

640
00:28:36,851 --> 00:28:38,560
I'm not familiar with that.
I mean,

641
00:28:38,561 --> 00:28:41,260
I know that the,
the,

642
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:41,670
there's,
there's,

643
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,720
there's constant talk about trying to,
Oh,

644
00:28:43,721 --> 00:28:46,660
you know,
just don't buy a certain product

645
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:52,080
the way they were actually the State 
Department told people to stop buying 

646
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,150
them,
but they have a national security threat

647
00:28:53,151 --> 00:28:58,151
or something or something along the 
lines of I'm a third party spying the 

648
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,130
concerns,
what does it say here,

649
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:04,490
Australia to band while away from five g
rollout amid security concerns,

650
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:09,260
but us had an issue and I think the US 
issue was slightly different.

651
00:29:09,261 --> 00:29:14,261
US was um,
who was the State Department that was 

652
00:29:14,261 --> 00:29:15,340
saying for security concerns to not.
Yeah.

653
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:16,470
I don't know.
But I,

654
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:17,310
you know,
whenever they talk,

655
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:18,380
look,
they're talking about these,

656
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:23,480
the,
the auto terrorists from and they say 

657
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,961
it's national security as if somehow my 
buying a foreign car is somehow 

658
00:29:25,961 --> 00:29:27,180
jeopardizing.
What is the national.

659
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:32,340
I don't know.
I mean even the Canadians have called 

660
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:32,340
trump out on it.
So what do you mean we,

661
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,340
you know,
we fought as allies in every single war.

662
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:38,030
How are you saying that you have to put 
tariffs on Canadian?

663
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,120
So why is,
why is trump doing this?

664
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,250
Look again,
he's going after

665
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:45,850
the symptom.
Trade deficits are the consequences of a

666
00:29:45,851 --> 00:29:50,851
problem.
Most politicians ignored the trade 

667
00:29:50,851 --> 00:29:50,851
deficits,
right?

668
00:29:50,851 --> 00:29:52,720
At least Donald trump is putting them on
the spotlight and saying,

669
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,010
look,
this is a problem.

670
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:59,100
It is a problem,
but not for the reason that trump 

671
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,231
believes in the short run in the here 
and now the trade deficits benefit 

672
00:30:01,231 --> 00:30:06,211
America.
Because the world is subsidizing our 

673
00:30:06,211 --> 00:30:09,091
standard of living.
We're getting to buy things that we 

674
00:30:09,091 --> 00:30:09,091
otherwise wouldn't be able to have.
I mean,

675
00:30:09,091 --> 00:30:13,261
without these trade deficits,
we wouldn't have all these consumer 

676
00:30:13,261 --> 00:30:13,261
goods on all these shelves.
I mean,

677
00:30:13,261 --> 00:30:16,330
people would not be able to buys them.
Prices would be much higher if we had to

678
00:30:16,331 --> 00:30:19,240
make stuff ourselves by having the 
Chinese make it,

679
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,280
you know,
it's a lot cheaper and plus,

680
00:30:21,281 --> 00:30:22,090
you know,
it's great for the,

681
00:30:22,091 --> 00:30:27,091
our environment because we don't have to
pollute our own air because the 

682
00:30:27,091 --> 00:30:27,091
factories are over there.

683
00:30:27,091 --> 00:30:31,500
Uh,
but he's so he's right that it's a 

684
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:34,501
problem.
But in that it's a reflection of the 

685
00:30:34,501 --> 00:30:38,281
fact that the economy is inefficient and
that's what needs to be addressed.

686
00:30:38,441 --> 00:30:38,950
It's like,
you know,

687
00:30:38,951 --> 00:30:43,951
we have cancer,
but you just can't put bandaids on the 

688
00:30:43,951 --> 00:30:45,820
blemishes or something to cover it up.
You got to actually get to the source of

689
00:30:45,821 --> 00:30:50,821
those blemishes,
which is the the Federal Reserve and 

690
00:30:50,821 --> 00:30:54,121
their bad monetary policy and our 
government policy or our fiscal policy 

691
00:30:54,121 --> 00:30:58,591
or regulatory policy.
We need to have that type of change and 

692
00:30:58,591 --> 00:31:02,281
then the trade deficits will go away,
but if we simply tried to put tariffs 

693
00:31:02,281 --> 00:31:03,670
on,
it's just going to make our own problems

694
00:31:03,671 --> 00:31:08,671
worse.
All that's going to do is make prices 

695
00:31:08,671 --> 00:31:08,671
higher.
Is this going to mean that Americans are

696
00:31:08,671 --> 00:31:12,301
gonna have to spend more money buying 
stuff and it also actually undermines a 

697
00:31:12,301 --> 00:31:16,561
lot of American businesses that export 
into countries that are retaliating and 

698
00:31:16,561 --> 00:31:20,641
also a lot of us businesses,
a import components and then they 

699
00:31:20,641 --> 00:31:24,991
assemble the components here,
but now those important parts are going 

700
00:31:24,991 --> 00:31:28,221
to be more expensive and so their net 
exports are more expensive and so they 

701
00:31:28,221 --> 00:31:28,221
become less efficient.

702
00:31:28,221 --> 00:31:32,960
The people that are supporting trump,
that people that are happy with the way 

703
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,691
things are going have have said that him
lowering taxes for corporations 

704
00:31:35,881 --> 00:31:40,881
encourages growth and encourages it.
It gets more jobs and there's more 

705
00:31:41,581 --> 00:31:43,800
economic activity.
Does that make sense?

706
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:44,370
Well look,

707
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,480
if we eliminate taxes,
yeah,

708
00:31:46,481 --> 00:31:51,481
that'd be great.
I mean the lower taxes are the better 

709
00:31:51,481 --> 00:31:54,001
it's going to be,
but not if you borrow the money to pay 

710
00:31:54,001 --> 00:31:56,701
for the tax cuts.
So the idea is if the government now has

711
00:31:56,861 --> 00:32:01,120
to go into the market and borrow money 
that it no longer collects and taxes,

712
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,490
that's going to have an impact on the 
economy,

713
00:32:03,491 --> 00:32:06,460
that's going to further deplete our 
savings pool.

714
00:32:06,461 --> 00:32:11,461
That's going to put real upward pressure
on interest rates and obviously the Fed 

715
00:32:11,461 --> 00:32:15,571
is trying to counteract that.
But you know what they did with the tax 

716
00:32:15,571 --> 00:32:17,500
code though,
they dramatically complicated it.

717
00:32:17,501 --> 00:32:22,501
I mean there's a lot of.
There's a lot more complexity in the 

718
00:32:22,501 --> 00:32:23,050
code now than there was before.
Not like it wasn't complex before.

719
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,750
So initially they talked about 
simplifying the code.

720
00:32:25,751 --> 00:32:27,260
They didn't do that.
They,

721
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:28,330
they,
they made the,

722
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:33,380
the,
the code a lot more complex and they 

723
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:33,380
certainly,
you know,

724
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:35,620
they lowered,
they raised lower taxes for some people,

725
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:37,680
but they raise taxes for other people.
Me,

726
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,920
depending on what state you're in,
there are a of people now that are going

727
00:32:39,921 --> 00:32:39,980
to

728
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,290
pay higher taxes.
What?

729
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:42,560
See what people are doing.
Well,

730
00:32:42,561 --> 00:32:44,410
people in California are you gotTa,
you know,

731
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:49,720
you got a 13 percent income tax in 
California that's no longer deductible 

732
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,390
on your state income tax,
on your federal income tax.

733
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,160
So that's it.
That's a new thing.

734
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:52,670
Well,
yeah,

735
00:32:52,671 --> 00:32:55,430
I mean,
up until this year you could deduct your

736
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:57,440
state income tax from your federal 
income tax.

737
00:32:57,441 --> 00:33:01,160
So you did the effective tax rate was,
you know,

738
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:06,210
maybe 40 percent less because it was 
just money you would've sent to 

739
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:06,650
Washington.
So instead you send it to Sacramento.

740
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:11,950
But basically the state tax rates are 
almost double now what they were last 

741
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:12,150
year,
uh,

742
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,600
in the,
the way it impacts the payer.

743
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:18,230
So there's a big increase in state taxes
for individuals.

744
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,610
You didn't,
you didn't know that?

745
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:20,890
No.
Yeah.

746
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:25,900
You know,
you gotta you know you're going to move 

747
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:25,900
to Puerto Rico with me.

748
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:28,120
I know,
but I hear you guys don't have any 

749
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:28,120
power.
Well,

750
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:28,120
we got power now.
Now many months.

751
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:28,870
Did it take?
What?

752
00:33:28,871 --> 00:33:30,740
Don't I have generator?
Yeah,

753
00:33:30,741 --> 00:33:35,741
but you're the only one.
You're like guards outside making sure 

754
00:33:35,741 --> 00:33:37,250
nobody steals your water.
No,

755
00:33:37,251 --> 00:33:37,840
it's not.
It's,

756
00:33:37,841 --> 00:33:40,640
you know.
In fact we were laughing about it,

757
00:33:40,641 --> 00:33:43,250
but you know,
I was on your show a year ago,

758
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:43,990
right?
We talked,

759
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,390
we talked a lot about Puerto Rico.
It was post trump.

760
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:48,500
Trump.
Trump was.

761
00:33:48,501 --> 00:33:52,280
Trump had won but it was before Maria,
but.

762
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:57,340
And so I was on the show and we were 
talking about Puerto Rico and we also 

763
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:59,810
talked about cryptocurrencies and 
bitcoin and stuff like that.

764
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:05,350
But since then hundreds and hundreds of 
crypto guys have moved to Puerto Rico.

765
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,510
I met some of my neighbors.
Now are these crypto millionaires?

766
00:34:11,511 --> 00:34:13,410
They're living on the beach.
They,

767
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:14,960
they,
they weren't there a year ago.

768
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,410
They're there now.

769
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:16,920
They're,
they,

770
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:18,860
they,
they call it a poor topia.

771
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,040
They all want to come there because 
there's no capital gains tax.

772
00:34:22,041 --> 00:34:23,270
But I got to,
you know,

773
00:34:23,271 --> 00:34:26,390
kind of credit you because I think a lot
of these guys didn't know about it until

774
00:34:26,391 --> 00:34:28,790
they heard about it on this podcast and 
they said,

775
00:34:28,791 --> 00:34:33,791
wait a minute,
there's no taxes down there in Puerto 

776
00:34:33,791 --> 00:34:36,160
Rico and now they're all there and they 
moved there just in time for the 

777
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:36,160
hurricane.
No,

778
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:40,541
they moved after the hurricane.
I moved before the hurricane is moving 

779
00:34:40,541 --> 00:34:41,240
after the hurricane,
a better move.

780
00:34:41,241 --> 00:34:46,241
Financially,
it's probably cheaper land easier now 

781
00:34:46,241 --> 00:34:51,100
know I can't even tell.
Some of the real estate has actually 

782
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:51,100
gone up.
Um,

783
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:56,080
yeah.
And like the real estate that was 

784
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:56,080
untouched,
you know,

785
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:56,540
I mean my community a weathered the 
storm pretty well,

786
00:34:56,541 --> 00:35:00,180
so maybe it made it more desirable.
Really Widens your community.

787
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,400
You do so well.
Just,

788
00:35:01,401 --> 00:35:02,490
I mean it's got,
it's,

789
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:02,960
it's,
you know,

790
00:35:02,961 --> 00:35:04,720
even though I'm on the beach,
the elevation is,

791
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:08,900
is very high so we didn't get any 
flooding and I guess the construction is

792
00:35:08,901 --> 00:35:10,040
much better there.
You know,

793
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:13,360
the houses are built better so they 
didn't know.

794
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:18,390
They didn't withstand the damage and the
community got up and up and running a 

795
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:18,740
lot quicker.
So how long were you without power?

796
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:19,760
Oh,
there was.

797
00:35:19,761 --> 00:35:24,761
Well,
officially there was probably no power 

798
00:35:24,761 --> 00:35:24,761
for a couple months,
but I have a,

799
00:35:24,761 --> 00:35:28,591
you know,
my condo has power just as a big 

800
00:35:28,591 --> 00:35:28,591
generator and so we had,
we had condo power there right away,

801
00:35:28,591 --> 00:35:31,070
but the house that I,
I ended up buying a house there too,

802
00:35:31,071 --> 00:35:36,071
right before the hurricane and I didn't 
have the generator put in yet so the 

803
00:35:36,071 --> 00:35:36,590
house didn't have power for months and 
months,

804
00:35:36,591 --> 00:35:38,010
which just exasperate,
I

805
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:43,010
had some damage to the house and then 
the fact that there is no power made it 

806
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:43,380
worse because it got very humid in 
there.

807
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:48,500
But I've since purchased a generator and
I've got it all installed and so I'm 

808
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,590
ready for the next,
for the next hurricane.

809
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,470
But you know,
I,

810
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:54,240
I got those funny,
funny they'd before the hurricane.

811
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:59,730
There was a lot of controversy from this
podcast from my,

812
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:00,420
um,
my,

813
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:00,990
my,
uh,

814
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:03,240
my talk about Puerto Rico because I 
mentioned on,

815
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:07,230
on the show that I had moved some 
employees to Puerto Rico.

816
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:11,040
I have three single guys that used to 
live out in southern California and they

817
00:36:11,041 --> 00:36:14,880
all moved out to Puerto Rico because I 
moved my business there.

818
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:17,820
This was in 2013.
I moved my asset management company.

819
00:36:17,821 --> 00:36:19,820
You're Pacific asset management,
moved it to,

820
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:21,030
uh,
to Puerto Rico.

821
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:26,540
And so these guys moved out.
They're single guys that I mentioned 

822
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:26,540
that they were having a good time there.

823
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,900
A lot of very beautiful women in Puerto 
Rico,

824
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:29,390
you know,
um,

825
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:32,610
I mentioned I think five Ms Dot Universe
has been from Puerto Rico,

826
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,160
which is,
which is a lot for a small place.

827
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:40,820
And I said that know they have a good 
time there because the labor force 

828
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:41,640
participation rate in Puerto Rico is 
terrible.

829
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,440
I mean hardly anybody has a job,
maybe,

830
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:46,950
maybe a third of the people who should 
be working or working.

831
00:36:46,951 --> 00:36:47,550
And that's,
you know.

832
00:36:47,551 --> 00:36:52,551
And that's,
again because of the socialism down 

833
00:36:52,551 --> 00:36:52,551
there,
the welfare state that's there and it,

834
00:36:52,551 --> 00:36:57,040
you know,
and the minimum wage in Puerto Rico is 

835
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:57,040
effectively like,
you know,

836
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:57,450
it's the medium wage,
it's like having a $15,

837
00:36:57,451 --> 00:37:02,451
$17 an hour minimum wage year.
So it destroys a lot of employment 

838
00:37:02,451 --> 00:37:02,451
opportunity,
dying island.

839
00:37:02,451 --> 00:37:03,570
So I mentioned that,
you know,

840
00:37:03,571 --> 00:37:04,680
if they,
you know,

841
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:09,681
they have a good time down there because
there's a lot of women and if you're a 

842
00:37:09,681 --> 00:37:09,681
guy and you got a job,
I mean,

843
00:37:09,681 --> 00:37:10,410
you know,
you could write your own ticket,

844
00:37:10,411 --> 00:37:14,940
that's a big plus to have a job because 
women want to date guys with jobs.

845
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,040
And,
and this was controversial,

846
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:18,300
you know,
you wouldn't think it would be,

847
00:37:18,301 --> 00:37:22,620
but all of a sudden all these big guys 
down there in Puerto Rico,

848
00:37:22,621 --> 00:37:27,621
they'll probably say something again 
because obviously they watch your 

849
00:37:27,621 --> 00:37:27,621
podcast.
But,

850
00:37:27,621 --> 00:37:31,540
but um,
couple of really big guys were calling 

851
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,120
me out saying that I'm insulting Puerto 
Rican women.

852
00:37:33,121 --> 00:37:33,600
Like,
you know,

853
00:37:33,601 --> 00:37:38,601
I'm calling them whores or something 
because I said that they want to date 

854
00:37:38,601 --> 00:37:38,601
guys with jobs.
Well,

855
00:37:38,601 --> 00:37:38,601
why

856
00:37:38,601 --> 00:37:41,200
doesn't every woman want a data guy with
a job?

857
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:46,260
Yes.
It's not just Puerto Rican into running 

858
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:46,260
around going,
I don't want to go with a job.

859
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:46,260
No,
exactly.

860
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:49,270
Of course a girl wants a god that has a 
job.

861
00:37:49,271 --> 00:37:50,590
I mean,
every girl.

862
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:55,680
Yeah,
I mean probably one of the main reasons 

863
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:55,680
we get jobs is to get girls.
Oh yeah.

864
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,020
I mean,
you know,

865
00:37:56,021 --> 00:38:01,021
and you know,
generally the more attractive the woman 

866
00:38:01,021 --> 00:38:04,170
you know,
the more the better your job's going to 

867
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:04,170
have to be to attract her.
Yeah.

868
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:07,441
There's a,
there's a term for that high pergamum 

869
00:38:07,441 --> 00:38:10,970
like women tend to gravitate towards men
with higher social status status and 

870
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:11,560
higher.
Well first of all,

871
00:38:11,561 --> 00:38:13,240
if you want a guy to take you out on a 
date,

872
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:15,070
if he doesn't have a job,
where's he going to take you?

873
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:16,050
There you go.
I mean,

874
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,390
you know,
so I mean it's not.

875
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:22,440
I didn't think it was a controversial 
statement is I think that point just 

876
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:25,891
making much ado about nothing these days
and they can write a blog and then you 

877
00:38:25,891 --> 00:38:29,101
talk about what they wrote because you 
were upset that them being upset at you 

878
00:38:29,101 --> 00:38:29,620
on the podcast and talking about it 
again.

879
00:38:29,621 --> 00:38:30,730
So you're feeding it.
No,

880
00:38:30,731 --> 00:38:31,920
but I'm correcting it.
I mean,

881
00:38:31,921 --> 00:38:33,790
I just want to say that it's not just,
you know,

882
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:37,720
there's nothing wrong with a woman 
wanting a guide that,

883
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,450
that has a good job and not only that 
it's favorable.

884
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:41,000
Well,
yeah.

885
00:38:41,001 --> 00:38:46,001
Well,
but it's not only just because he can 

886
00:38:46,001 --> 00:38:46,001
take her on a date.
I mean,

887
00:38:46,001 --> 00:38:48,960
when a woman is on a date with a guy,
I mean everybody is a potential husband 

888
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:49,210
and you've got to bring something to the
table.

889
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,250
You know,
you gotta you know,

890
00:38:50,251 --> 00:38:51,840
you gotTa,
you gotTa have ambition,

891
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:53,080
you've got to be a go getter.

892
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:53,670
You gotTa,
you know,

893
00:38:53,671 --> 00:38:56,650
you just get me living in your parent's 
basement.

894
00:38:57,690 --> 00:39:02,690
What does that mean?
You got to get a job right to get the 

895
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:02,690
money.
So then when you get some money,

896
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:03,610
you get the power to get the whipping.
How are they saying?

897
00:39:03,611 --> 00:39:08,611
What was the protest that I was 
insulting Puerto Rican women by saying 

898
00:39:08,611 --> 00:39:12,121
they want a man with a job,
like they're just all gold diggers or 

899
00:39:12,121 --> 00:39:12,121
something and I,
you know,

900
00:39:12,121 --> 00:39:12,940
I didn't say that guy,
you know,

901
00:39:12,941 --> 00:39:13,830
it was just,
they only,

902
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:15,550
they only wanted money.
But look,

903
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,250
I mean,
having a job is a key thing.

904
00:39:18,251 --> 00:39:18,960
I mean,
God,

905
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:23,970
we don't care.
The guys don't care as much what the 

906
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:23,970
woman does.
But women,

907
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:24,280
I mean that's a big thing.
Most nothing.

908
00:39:24,281 --> 00:39:25,690
They don't care at all.
If she's hot,

909
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,360
if it takes a lot of money and the 
girl's hot.

910
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,090
Yeah.
I mean,

911
00:39:29,091 --> 00:39:31,230
look here,
she got nice to read.

912
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:35,200
If a guy was going to set up a guy right
with a friend,

913
00:39:35,201 --> 00:39:37,720
the first thing that guy's going to say 
ask is what does she look like?

914
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,170
Yeah,
right.

915
00:39:38,171 --> 00:39:39,880
That's the first question.
Is She nice?

916
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:44,230
Right?
If a woman is going to tell a girlfriend

917
00:39:44,231 --> 00:39:46,060
about a guy,
what's the first question?

918
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,080
Probably what it looks like first know 
what is he doing?

919
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,640
I guarantee it's what is he doing?
What does he do for a living?

920
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:55,140
I think first it's what he looks like.
Second is what is he not know?

921
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:57,240
I think what he looks like his lower 
down on.

922
00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:58,990
I think it's what does he do for a 
living?

923
00:39:58,991 --> 00:40:00,740
Is He.
Does he have a nice personalities?

924
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:03,040
They have a good sense of humor I think.
I think.

925
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:08,130
How does he look?
Is a little bit lower down on a woman's 

926
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:08,130
totem pole.

927
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:08,410
Have to pass it.
How hot she is.

928
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:11,280
Well maybe.
Yeah.

929
00:40:11,290 --> 00:40:13,380
It depends on how good she's doing in 
the marketplace.

930
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:14,950
Yeah,
but I mean,

931
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,650
but all this.
I mean it's almost,

932
00:40:17,651 --> 00:40:22,651
it was almost part of the whole 
political correctness thing of it like 

933
00:40:22,651 --> 00:40:22,651
or the me too.
Like you can't,

934
00:40:22,651 --> 00:40:22,720
you,
you,

935
00:40:22,721 --> 00:40:24,130
you,
you can't say something.

936
00:40:24,131 --> 00:40:27,040
Anything that you say is going to be 
spun like this is,

937
00:40:27,041 --> 00:40:31,810
this is against women because I'm 
stating something that's very obvious,

938
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:32,650
right?
That,

939
00:40:32,651 --> 00:40:34,990
that,
that so can't state obvious anymore.

940
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,500
No,
no,

941
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,510
no.
I mean it.

942
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:42,610
It's all like look like you can.
Because I think these outrage peddlers 

943
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:43,960
that make these articles and write these
blogs,

944
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,270
who the fuck is agreeing with them?
I just,

945
00:40:46,271 --> 00:40:51,271
I just don't buy it.
I think what they're doing is they're 

946
00:40:51,271 --> 00:40:52,900
striking a chord and a,
a few malcontents go along with it.

947
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:55,490
But you read those things and you think 
like,

948
00:40:55,510 --> 00:41:00,510
wow,
there's some validity to this because 

949
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:01,510
it's in x publication.
So I got a comment on this.

950
00:41:01,511 --> 00:41:03,340
They're,
they're misrepresenting what I said,

951
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,490
but they're outraged merchants.
Yeah.

952
00:41:05,491 --> 00:41:10,491
And everybody wants to act like you 
can't say something that's offensive to 

953
00:41:10,491 --> 00:41:15,121
anybody.
Like if somebody gets offended then you 

954
00:41:15,121 --> 00:41:15,121
know,
like,

955
00:41:15,121 --> 00:41:15,121
you know,
this,

956
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:15,820
what was this,
you know,

957
00:41:15,821 --> 00:41:18,280
this one of these contestants,
I read this story,

958
00:41:18,281 --> 00:41:20,890
but one of the contestants on the 
Bachelorette,

959
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:26,820
I'm apparently on his instagram page.
He liked some jokes that,

960
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:28,690
um,
that,

961
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:33,720
you know,
maybe off color a little bit offensive 

962
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:33,720
jokes that right wing.
Somebody on the.

963
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:38,560
I had posted on their instagram page and
it was like a big deal to take that as 

964
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,980
whole instagram page.
I mean,

965
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:42,560
it's obviously jokes,
they're jokes.

966
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:45,320
Jokes are offensive.
That's part of what makes them funny.

967
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:50,320
I mean,
I mean how it almost all the jokes 

968
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,541
offend somebody,
but now you can't even have a sense of 

969
00:41:52,541 --> 00:41:52,670
humor.
Everything has to be,

970
00:41:52,671 --> 00:41:53,900
you know,
you can't,

971
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,000
you can't offend anybody,
which you don't have a right not to be 

972
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,411
offended.
That's the whole part of freedom of 

973
00:42:02,411 --> 00:42:04,121
speech.
People are going to say things and do 

974
00:42:04,121 --> 00:42:06,551
things that you might be offended by and
you just gotta you just gotTa deal with 

975
00:42:06,551 --> 00:42:07,100
it.
You can't be looking like,

976
00:42:07,101 --> 00:42:07,690
you know,
I,

977
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:09,890
I got to have a law against that.
Or,

978
00:42:09,891 --> 00:42:10,850
but these,
uh,

979
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:14,180
these offense merchants,
these people that get offended,

980
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:15,110
they,
they,

981
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,610
that's their currency.
They,

982
00:42:16,611 --> 00:42:21,611
they,
they trade in being offended and then 

983
00:42:21,611 --> 00:42:23,540
once they find something that's in any 
way offensive,

984
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:26,390
they just start writing blogs about it 
and making videos about it.

985
00:42:26,391 --> 00:42:28,010
And that's their,
that's their,

986
00:42:28,011 --> 00:42:33,011
in their,
in is finding something Peter Shifts 

987
00:42:33,011 --> 00:42:35,921
said about Puerto Rican women women's 
offensive because it's just,

988
00:42:37,391 --> 00:42:38,540
this is the world we live in.

989
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:43,540
A white guy like you wealthy guy,
you're going to talk about Puerto Rican 

990
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:44,150
women,
you fucking piece of shit.

991
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:44,830
Well,
they're,

992
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:46,460
I mean they're white,
most of,

993
00:42:46,461 --> 00:42:49,550
I mean there are a little darker skin 
and then the most complicated,

994
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:52,670
but in this day and age that they're 
Latino,

995
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:54,650
they're people of color.
What color am I?

996
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:55,830
I got to La.
I'm not,

997
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:56,690
you know,
I got a little color.

998
00:42:56,691 --> 00:43:01,691
To me that's a,
that's an interesting conversation I 

999
00:43:01,691 --> 00:43:01,691
just had with a friend of mine who she 
claimed she's black.

1000
00:43:01,691 --> 00:43:02,510
I'm darker than you.
Oh,

1001
00:43:02,511 --> 00:43:03,810
you black.
Yeah.

1002
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:08,950
But it's all like,
it's this whole mentality that people 

1003
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:11,921
have now about not being offended is 
about feeling that they have a right to 

1004
00:43:11,921 --> 00:43:16,280
something or not being entitled.
Tyler people confusing a privilege with,

1005
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:16,850
with the.
Right.

1006
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:17,630
Right.
Right.

1007
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:19,520
So you have all these groups that 
demand,

1008
00:43:19,521 --> 00:43:21,770
you know,
women's rights or gay rights,

1009
00:43:22,370 --> 00:43:27,370
women or gays,
they don't have rights because they're 

1010
00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:27,370
women,
right?

1011
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:32,410
We all have individual rights and so men
and women have rights because they're 

1012
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:34,160
individuals.
They don't get a separate.

1013
00:43:34,161 --> 00:43:36,240
Right because they fit into a group.
Right?

1014
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:41,270
All that is about privilege and you 
don't have special privileges granted to

1015
00:43:41,271 --> 00:43:46,271
you by the constitution.
We all have rights and when people try 

1016
00:43:46,271 --> 00:43:50,831
to pretend that a privilege or a group 
privilege and try to give that the 

1017
00:43:50,831 --> 00:43:53,660
status of a right,
I know you talked about it on your,

1018
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:58,720
on your podcast when we had the supreme 
court ruling recently regarding the gay 

1019
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:03,050
couple that wanted a wedding cake and 
they,

1020
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:08,230
you know,
they sued because the baker wouldn't 

1021
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:12,281
make a wedding cake with a couple of 
guys on the top and decorated in a way 

1022
00:44:12,281 --> 00:44:16,901
that it was obviously for a gay wedding.
There's a bottom is understanding about 

1023
00:44:16,901 --> 00:44:21,881
that.
And I've read something recently that 

1024
00:44:21,881 --> 00:44:23,350
not only did they not do that,
but they weren't making custom cakes so 

1025
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:25,490
they didn't make custom cakes for 
weddings.

1026
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:27,010
So when these,
the,

1027
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:29,470
the gay couple came in so they wanted a 
custom cake.

1028
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:29,840
They said,
no,

1029
00:44:29,841 --> 00:44:34,841
we don't make that.
Like that was also part of the problem 

1030
00:44:34,841 --> 00:44:34,841
was they don't,
that's not something they even did.

1031
00:44:34,841 --> 00:44:38,050
They could've,
would've sold them a cake theory had one

1032
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,520
or two dudes holding hands.
Well,

1033
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:43,110
the bigger problem is first of all,
they.

1034
00:44:43,111 --> 00:44:48,111
It's not like you have this gay couple 
that just went into a bakery and then 

1035
00:44:48,111 --> 00:44:50,130
they were denied the ability to buy a 
cake.

1036
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:55,370
Right.
They probably went to 100 bakeries to 

1037
00:44:55,370 --> 00:44:56,230
find the one that wouldn't make the 
vacation specifically do that.

1038
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,700
Part of the story was that they wanted 
someone to deny them.

1039
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,200
Yes.
And had a story.

1040
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:02,430
Right.
And of course,

1041
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:03,690
you know,
if you're a baker,

1042
00:45:03,930 --> 00:45:04,360
right?
I,

1043
00:45:04,361 --> 00:45:06,660
I don't know what the margins are on 
wedding cakes,

1044
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,360
but wedding cakes are probably like the 
holy grail of cakes,

1045
00:45:09,361 --> 00:45:09,570
right?

1046
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:09,890
I mean,
you're.

1047
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:12,120
If you're sitting there on the small 
bakery shop,

1048
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:17,510
you're waiting for somebody to call for 
a wedding cake because those are the 

1049
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:18,570
biggest case.
You could make very expensive cake.

1050
00:45:18,571 --> 00:45:22,640
So everybody wants to do a wedding cake.
Nobody cares whether there's two guys or

1051
00:45:22,641 --> 00:45:27,641
a guy and a girl on the top of it.
You just want to make the money that 

1052
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:27,641
you're going to get from baking wedding 
cake.

1053
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:31,470
Now you come across a guy who just has a
strong religious conviction.

1054
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:33,110
He just,
you know,

1055
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:36,330
doesn't want to bake a cake for a gay 
wedding.

1056
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:37,530
Okay.
I mean,

1057
00:45:37,531 --> 00:45:39,550
he's the one that's losing.
He's losing out on the,

1058
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:40,170
the,
the,

1059
00:45:40,171 --> 00:45:43,380
the commission to bake the cake.
I mean,

1060
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:48,240
the gay couple isn't hurt by that.
There's so many bakeries that would bake

1061
00:45:48,241 --> 00:45:50,640
them.
That cake was this couple.

1062
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:53,010
Were they denied because of religious 
reasons?

1063
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:54,720
Is that why the people said they 
weren't,

1064
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:56,270
wouldn't make the case that.
Yes,

1065
00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:01,280
they said it was religious reasons and 
that's what the supreme court I think 

1066
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,040
went on religious freedom,
but as far as I'm concerned,

1067
00:46:02,070 --> 00:46:03,540
it doesn't matter what their religion 
is.

1068
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:09,140
Nobody is required to perform a service 
for somebody else if they don't want to.

1069
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:12,450
Okay.
What if it was a black couple?

1070
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:17,480
Yes.
And what if these people are racist and 

1071
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:17,850
what have they said,
we don't want to bake a cake for a Black

1072
00:46:17,850 --> 00:46:19,710
Cup.
Well then the black couple can go find a

1073
00:46:19,711 --> 00:46:21,540
bakery that we'll bake them a cake.
I mean,

1074
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:25,860
what's the odds of there being a racist 
Baker out there?

1075
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:26,370
But I,
you know,

1076
00:46:26,371 --> 00:46:28,740
I mentioned if I was today's Day and 
age,

1077
00:46:28,741 --> 00:46:30,350
it's less than ever before.
Right?

1078
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:31,470
But let's look.
Look,

1079
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:32,610
I mean,
it's still possible,

1080
00:46:32,611 --> 00:46:33,570
right?
I'm Jewish,

1081
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:33,960
right?

1082
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:36,690
Let's say there's an anti Semite Baker,
right?

1083
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:40,890
And if he,
if I go in there and the guy says,

1084
00:46:41,350 --> 00:46:42,000
you know,
oh,

1085
00:46:42,001 --> 00:46:44,490
I don't want to bake cake for Jews,
fine,

1086
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:49,710
you know,
because let's assume that he knows I'm 

1087
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:49,800
Jewish.
He hates Jews and he spits in the cake.

1088
00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:51,340
I mean,
I'd like to know,

1089
00:46:51,341 --> 00:46:55,410
like right up front that this guy who's 
about to bake my cake hates Jews.

1090
00:46:55,470 --> 00:46:58,740
So then I'll go and buy my cake from 
somebody who doesn't hate Jews because I

1091
00:46:58,741 --> 00:47:01,530
don't want to worry about what I'm going
to be putting them in my mouth.

1092
00:47:01,531 --> 00:47:06,531
I mean,
why would you want to even force 

1093
00:47:06,531 --> 00:47:08,810
somebody to bake a cake for you that 
you've got to eat if you're forcing it 

1094
00:47:08,810 --> 00:47:10,140
to do it or you know,
this is all nonsense.

1095
00:47:10,141 --> 00:47:10,900
But you know,
the,

1096
00:47:11,050 --> 00:47:15,210
the idea that you can't discriminate,
that you can't make choices,

1097
00:47:15,211 --> 00:47:15,390
right?

1098
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:15,900
I,
I,

1099
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:19,670
I have a right as an individual to um,
you know,

1100
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:22,680
to do things that I want to do,
but I can't force somebody else.

1101
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:28,100
Writes are about big government.
Could you can't rob from me and you 

1102
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:30,760
can't steal from me so you can't take 
away from me something that I have,

1103
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:36,060
but I can't force you to give me 
something I don't have and just because 

1104
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:37,260
I feel a certain way.
Like if you go back to the,

1105
00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:38,030
the,
uh,

1106
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,340
the gay couple to say,
okay,

1107
00:47:39,341 --> 00:47:42,230
you can't discriminate.
How did the Supreme Court ruling that by

1108
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:42,550
the.
Well,

1109
00:47:42,551 --> 00:47:43,000
they,
they,

1110
00:47:43,010 --> 00:47:45,940
they uphold,
held the right of this individual,

1111
00:47:45,941 --> 00:47:48,640
but it wasn't like a real individual to,
to get.

1112
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:52,210
But I think it had to do with some 
esoteric state law.

1113
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:56,920
It wasn't a definitive ruling that says 
that you have a right to discriminate,

1114
00:47:56,921 --> 00:47:58,600
which I believe that.
I believe you do.

1115
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:01,900
I don't think the government should be 
discriminating but private individuals.

1116
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:03,910
But the point I was about to make is,
you know,

1117
00:48:03,911 --> 00:48:04,410
for,
for,

1118
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:06,760
for gay.
So let's say that you,

1119
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:08,260
Joe Rogan,
we're,

1120
00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:13,120
I'm working as a Gigolo.
That was your job.

1121
00:48:13,270 --> 00:48:16,760
You just had sex with women and you 
charge them money nights.

1122
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:17,590
Yeah.
That's your job.

1123
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:20,890
Now,
what if a dude comes up to you and wants

1124
00:48:20,891 --> 00:48:24,220
to partake in your services?
Do you have to serve him?

1125
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:26,170
That's not the job,
sir.

1126
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:27,600
The job was women.
No,

1127
00:48:27,601 --> 00:48:28,810
no.
You can't discriminate.

1128
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,670
What's right.
That's my point.

1129
00:48:30,671 --> 00:48:33,370
Discriminate in terms of having sex with
men.

1130
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,120
Well,
not if you're doing it for business.

1131
00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:37,770
If it's your business.
Now my job is Gigolo.

1132
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:39,920
Gigolo was a guy,
has sex with women.

1133
00:48:39,930 --> 00:48:42,220
I know that's the job.
It's like you're asking a firefighter to

1134
00:48:42,221 --> 00:48:45,520
dig a hole for the Gigolo is a guy that 
has sex for money.

1135
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:47,530
It matter whether it's a guy or a girl.
No,

1136
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:49,470
that's the point though.
Women Bro.

1137
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,040
Well,
but then your business card,

1138
00:48:51,041 --> 00:48:52,780
but then you're discriminating against 
men.

1139
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:56,320
How could you deny?
How could you deny a man the opportunity

1140
00:48:56,321 --> 00:48:58,060
to have sex with you?
Interesting.

1141
00:48:58,210 --> 00:49:00,130
Sees the same thing.
You can't look and you can say,

1142
00:49:00,131 --> 00:49:01,660
what if?
What if it's not sex?

1143
00:49:01,661 --> 00:49:02,660
Okay,
that's mess.

1144
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:08,240
What if it's just massages?
What if your [inaudible] but for some 

1145
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:08,240
reason just don't want a massage.
Guys,

1146
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:11,290
you just only want to massage girls.
Shouldn't you be able to do that?

1147
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:13,800
Yes.
Yeah.

1148
00:49:13,810 --> 00:49:14,640
I mean,
so what?

1149
00:49:14,730 --> 00:49:18,580
And so it's,
it's touching people like you.

1150
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:20,830
If you're a business,
you want your business to be limited.

1151
00:49:20,890 --> 00:49:22,250
Oh,
do is massage chicks,

1152
00:49:22,270 --> 00:49:23,620
bro.
I don't touch dudes.

1153
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:24,130
Yeah,
why?

1154
00:49:24,310 --> 00:49:24,900
But why.
But yeah,

1155
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:28,240
but you should have a right to do that.
But then once you extrapolate it,

1156
00:49:28,241 --> 00:49:29,560
you just make a decision.

1157
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:34,560
Now you could make more money if you 
massage girls and guys because you have 

1158
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:38,821
a bigger market.
But if you want to limit your business 

1159
00:49:38,821 --> 00:49:39,070
opportunity to just women,
well that hurts you.

1160
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:41,290
Right?
Then it's your right to do that.

1161
00:49:41,530 --> 00:49:46,530
Yeah.
Like a massage therapist that doesn't 

1162
00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:47,080
want a massage guys.
You never hear about those and you don't

1163
00:49:47,081 --> 00:49:49,450
get offended.
Men Don't get offended by that.

1164
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:52,780
Guys want massage me.
Well,

1165
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:54,210
but you know,
you could do it as a,

1166
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,620
as a customer.
I mean,

1167
00:49:55,621 --> 00:49:55,960
I,
you know,

1168
00:49:55,961 --> 00:49:59,260
let's just say I'm a,
I want a massage and I can say,

1169
00:49:59,261 --> 00:50:01,120
look,
I prefer to get a massage by a woman.

1170
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:06,360
Yes.
I mean most guys would probably prefer 

1171
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:06,360
to get a massage by a woman.
Yeah.

1172
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:06,760
Well,
is that that that's totally legal.

1173
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:09,850
They always let the customer,
the customer can discriminate.

1174
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:12,130
The employee can discriminate,
right?

1175
00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:13,640
Nobody would say,
you know,

1176
00:50:13,690 --> 00:50:14,260
hey,
if I,

1177
00:50:14,410 --> 00:50:18,520
let's say I happen to be black and I 
want to work for a black boss,

1178
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:24,000
nobody would say that was wrong.
I could go to a white boss and I could 

1179
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:24,000
say,
no,

1180
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,580
I'm sorry.
I don't want to take the job because I 

1181
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:28,580
want to work for some in black bay.
You sue me for not breaking.

1182
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:31,430
You're actively seeking out a black 
boss,

1183
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:36,490
which is the difference between that and
being approached by a bunch of white 

1184
00:50:36,490 --> 00:50:36,490
people and saying,
no,

1185
00:50:36,490 --> 00:50:36,490
I hate white people.
No,

1186
00:50:36,490 --> 00:50:36,890
no,
no,

1187
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:37,790
no.
The point is,

1188
00:50:37,791 --> 00:50:41,060
if a,
if a white person or even a black person

1189
00:50:41,061 --> 00:50:44,160
was seeking out a job application of 
about,

1190
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:46,760
they would say that's illegal.
You can't discriminate,

1191
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,570
but the employer can do it.
All the employee can do it all.

1192
00:50:49,571 --> 00:50:51,800
He was right customers,
right.

1193
00:50:51,801 --> 00:50:53,840
If I was,
if I was a.

1194
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:59,100
If a gay couple wanted to have a cake 
baked and I went and they went into a 

1195
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:01,790
bakery and they said yes,
we'd like to have a cake bake,

1196
00:51:01,791 --> 00:51:06,740
are you straight or gay because we want 
our cake to be baked by a gay baker,

1197
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:08,210
and the straight guy said,
no,

1198
00:51:08,211 --> 00:51:09,080
I'm straight.
Sorry.

1199
00:51:09,081 --> 00:51:13,430
They find they can keep searching until 
they found the gay and no one would say,

1200
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,190
and I'm not saying that we should make 
that illegal.

1201
00:51:16,191 --> 00:51:18,110
I'm just saying the laws should be 
consistent.

1202
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:23,500
That means that is interesting that the 
employer or rather the customer can 

1203
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:27,911
basically go wherever they like and no,
no one says you didn't go into this 

1204
00:51:27,911 --> 00:51:31,631
restaurant because you don't like gay 
people because gay people run this 

1205
00:51:31,631 --> 00:51:31,631
restaurant.
Nobody ever says that.

1206
00:51:31,631 --> 00:51:33,500
Right.
And they can't force you to eat there if

1207
00:51:33,501 --> 00:51:35,660
you don't want to go the other way.

1208
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:40,660
They can.
They can force you to use or to have 

1209
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:42,840
someone use your services even if you 
don't believe in what they stand.

1210
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:43,500
Yeah.
And they.

1211
00:51:43,510 --> 00:51:45,830
And then the left always tries to make 
it out.

1212
00:51:45,831 --> 00:51:47,510
Like if you have this perspective,
right?

1213
00:51:47,511 --> 00:51:48,200
Oh,
like,

1214
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:50,330
oh,
you must be a racist if you believe that

1215
00:51:50,331 --> 00:51:52,190
people have a right to discriminate.
Look,

1216
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:53,240
I,
I'm,

1217
00:51:53,450 --> 00:51:58,450
I believe that people have a right to 
say a lot of things that I disagree 

1218
00:51:58,450 --> 00:52:01,631
with.
I'm not going to stop them from saying 

1219
00:52:01,631 --> 00:52:01,631
things.
You know,

1220
00:52:01,631 --> 00:52:02,180
I believe in free speech,
even if what you're saying is idiotic or

1221
00:52:02,181 --> 00:52:07,181
offensive,
and I believe people ever right to 

1222
00:52:07,181 --> 00:52:10,061
discriminate against it.
The bigger problem is when the 

1223
00:52:10,061 --> 00:52:12,701
government becomes the thought police 
because the minute you make it illegal 

1224
00:52:12,701 --> 00:52:14,060
to discriminate,
now you have to get into people's minds,

1225
00:52:14,061 --> 00:52:19,061
right?
If somebody doesn't promote somebody or 

1226
00:52:19,061 --> 00:52:22,481
fire somebody and they happened to be 
black or a woman or too old or 

1227
00:52:22,671 --> 00:52:24,710
handicapped,
you assume their motive,

1228
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:25,730
but no,
but now you're going to say,

1229
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:30,760
oh,
you fired that person a b because he's 

1230
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:33,911
black,
but what if that had nothing to do with 

1231
00:52:33,911 --> 00:52:33,911
it?

1232
00:52:33,911 --> 00:52:35,520
Right?
You're assuming the motive for firing 

1233
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:37,181
people and now I got to prove that I 
didn't do something for what I was 

1234
00:52:37,181 --> 00:52:37,181
thinking,
what I did.

1235
00:52:37,181 --> 00:52:37,181
Something.
I mean,

1236
00:52:37,430 --> 00:52:38,630
none of that shit.
You know?

1237
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:42,230
All of that too,
makes it so much harder for employers.

1238
00:52:42,290 --> 00:52:43,220
I mean,
look at what just happened.

1239
00:52:43,221 --> 00:52:44,750
This isn't race,
but it's part of it.

1240
00:52:44,910 --> 00:52:46,170
Do you see that story?
Um,

1241
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:51,760
uh,
the other day about trump's driver is 

1242
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:52,160
suing him for overtime.
Yes,

1243
00:52:52,161 --> 00:52:52,970
I did see that.
Yeah.

1244
00:52:52,971 --> 00:52:57,410
So this guy worked for the trump 
organization for like 25 years,

1245
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:02,680
drive into his personal driver for 
Donald Trump and he's now suing him 

1246
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:07,270
because he claims that he worked more 
than 40 hours a week and so he wants 

1247
00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:09,380
more money right now.
Of course he worked for 25 years.

1248
00:53:09,410 --> 00:53:12,560
Why didn't he ask for a raise like 
during those 25 years?

1249
00:53:12,561 --> 00:53:15,230
Right.
But apparently his job,

1250
00:53:15,231 --> 00:53:17,900
he had to be on call for maybe,
I don't know,

1251
00:53:17,901 --> 00:53:19,280
10 hours a day.
Right.

1252
00:53:20,150 --> 00:53:22,580
And an on call doesn't mean he was 
actually driving.

1253
00:53:22,610 --> 00:53:25,500
He just had to be available to trump if 
trump needed them,

1254
00:53:25,950 --> 00:53:26,160
but

1255
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:26,590
that,
you know,

1256
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:29,580
he could be on the Internet,
he could be watching a movie,

1257
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:31,300
it could be reading the books and in 
emails,

1258
00:53:31,301 --> 00:53:32,280
you know,
traded stocks,

1259
00:53:32,281 --> 00:53:34,510
whatever he wants to do.
So it's not like it was that,

1260
00:53:34,550 --> 00:53:39,550
like he was really working,
but he had to be available so he 

1261
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:39,550
couldn't go out of town.
Right.

1262
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:41,760
Um,
but he's going back and he says that,

1263
00:53:41,761 --> 00:53:46,761
well,
I had to be available for more than 40 

1264
00:53:46,761 --> 00:53:49,251
hours a week.
Well maybe it was 50 hours a week or 55 

1265
00:53:49,251 --> 00:53:50,250
hours a week and now he wants back pay 
time and a half.

1266
00:53:50,251 --> 00:53:52,170
Right.
Because overtime laws say you got to get

1267
00:53:52,171 --> 00:53:53,760
time and a half.
But first of all,

1268
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:56,940
he wasn't even an hourly worker.
The guy collected a salary,

1269
00:53:56,941 --> 00:53:59,100
something like 65,
$70,000

1270
00:53:59,101 --> 00:54:04,101
a year was his salary and you know,
he knew what the salary was when he took

1271
00:54:04,951 --> 00:54:05,460
the job.

1272
00:54:05,730 --> 00:54:07,770
He knew what the hours were.
If he didn't like it,

1273
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:12,860
he could have said something to trump.
He could have demanded higher pay or he 

1274
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:12,860
could have quit.
Right.

1275
00:54:12,930 --> 00:54:17,930
But instead he works without complaint.
And then 25 years later files a big 

1276
00:54:17,930 --> 00:54:21,560
lawsuit now the toys out of work.
Now he's working there.

1277
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:22,920
He's still working.
There he is.

1278
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:26,100
Yeah.
And he's suing Balis working in which,

1279
00:54:26,101 --> 00:54:27,450
you know.
And then of course,

1280
00:54:27,451 --> 00:54:29,100
if you fire them when they sue you,
it's like,

1281
00:54:29,101 --> 00:54:30,990
oh,
it's retaliation that it makes it worse.

1282
00:54:31,290 --> 00:54:32,950
But the problem is,
you know,

1283
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:35,130
trump,
he's got a lot of money.

1284
00:54:35,131 --> 00:54:36,330
I mean,
he can deal with this,

1285
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:39,270
but your average small businessman,
you know,

1286
00:54:39,570 --> 00:54:42,090
this kind of stuff kills you when people
start suing you,

1287
00:54:42,510 --> 00:54:46,680
it costs a lot of money.
And a lot of that happens too with um,

1288
00:54:46,710 --> 00:54:47,150
you know,
the,

1289
00:54:47,151 --> 00:54:48,810
the,
the discrimination laws,

1290
00:54:48,811 --> 00:54:53,811
I mean because a small business owners 
are so concerned about getting sued that

1291
00:54:54,061 --> 00:54:57,240
they try to hire people that they think 
are less likely to sue them.

1292
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:02,240
And then it ends up backfiring because 
it works against all the people who are 

1293
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,030
protected classes who are now able to 
sue you.

1294
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:09,260
You know.
But I also wanted to point out on the 

1295
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:09,260
overtime laws because so many people 
think,

1296
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:09,840
oh,
this is terrible,

1297
00:55:09,841 --> 00:55:11,250
right?
I mean he should pay overtime.

1298
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:16,560
Overtime is those laws are probably some
of the worst laws out there because they

1299
00:55:17,281 --> 00:55:18,990
don't protect workers,
right?

1300
00:55:18,991 --> 00:55:23,991
Because what happens is,
let's say you got a job and you're 

1301
00:55:23,991 --> 00:55:26,790
working 40 hours a week and you're an 
hourly worker and you want,

1302
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:28,650
you want more hours,
you want more money.

1303
00:55:29,210 --> 00:55:30,360
Maybe you know,
maybe you want to,

1304
00:55:30,361 --> 00:55:30,870
you know,
you,

1305
00:55:30,871 --> 00:55:35,871
you're trying to track the higher 
caliber of girls who try to get more 

1306
00:55:35,871 --> 00:55:35,871
money.
You want to work more hours,

1307
00:55:35,871 --> 00:55:39,860
so sexist what you just said.
So say in a blog so you can tell it.

1308
00:55:39,930 --> 00:55:41,490
You tell your boss,
hey,

1309
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:44,040
can I,
can I work an extra 10 hours a week?

1310
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:45,450
Right?
I want to get some.

1311
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:47,160
I want to get some.
I want to make some more money.

1312
00:55:47,161 --> 00:55:49,200
Right?
Well your boss says,

1313
00:55:49,201 --> 00:55:54,201
well I'm sorry,
I'd like to let you work an extra 10 

1314
00:55:54,201 --> 00:55:54,201
hours,
but I have to pay a time and a half.

1315
00:55:54,201 --> 00:55:55,050
Right?
And the guys look,

1316
00:55:55,051 --> 00:56:00,051
well I don't need time and a half.
I'll just work 10 hours for the same 

1317
00:56:00,051 --> 00:56:00,051
pay.
That's illegal.

1318
00:56:00,051 --> 00:56:01,200
Sorry.
I would like to do it,

1319
00:56:01,590 --> 00:56:03,000
but I can't.
And if the,

1320
00:56:03,090 --> 00:56:08,090
if that boss needs extra workers,
he has to go bring on a part time 

1321
00:56:08,090 --> 00:56:11,781
worker.
So now let's say if I want to get an 

1322
00:56:11,781 --> 00:56:13,710
extra 10 hours work,
I got to find another job someplace else

1323
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:16,390
where I can work part time where the,
the,

1324
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:21,420
the time and a half law doesn't apply.
But now I got to get from my full time 

1325
00:56:21,871 --> 00:56:23,980
job to my part time job.
How long does that

1326
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:25,480
take me?
How common is this though?

1327
00:56:25,481 --> 00:56:28,470
That people are denying people extra 
world.

1328
00:56:28,471 --> 00:56:31,170
It's very needed because they don't want
to pay the time of the half.

1329
00:56:31,210 --> 00:56:32,170
Oh,
it happens all the time.

1330
00:56:32,171 --> 00:56:34,240
I mean that's,
that's where moonlighting came from.

1331
00:56:34,241 --> 00:56:39,241
That's the whole.
I mean obviously people you're going to 

1332
00:56:39,241 --> 00:56:41,880
have.
You can have people that worked for two 

1333
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:41,880
employers and then other people working 
in there.

1334
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:43,840
They're going back and forth between the
same company.

1335
00:56:43,841 --> 00:56:47,380
So what you're saying is it's weird if 
someone has to work extra hours,

1336
00:56:47,381 --> 00:56:51,040
why you paying them double the money or 
time and a half,

1337
00:56:51,070 --> 00:56:53,440
five and a half.
Why paying the extra money?

1338
00:56:53,441 --> 00:56:58,441
Because they're doing just just because 
they're working more than eight hours a 

1339
00:56:58,441 --> 00:56:58,441
day.
Well,

1340
00:56:58,441 --> 00:57:03,000
but the thing is the employer doesn't 
want to pay the extra and he doesn't 

1341
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:03,250
have to,
if he can hire somebody part time,

1342
00:57:03,251 --> 00:57:06,820
but the point is that all of these,
um,

1343
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:07,640
the,
the,

1344
00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:12,780
the details of employment should be 
negotiated by the employer and the 

1345
00:57:13,241 --> 00:57:14,860
employee that government should stay out
of it,

1346
00:57:15,310 --> 00:57:17,200
you know,
and that time and a half is a government

1347
00:57:17,201 --> 00:57:17,470
law.

1348
00:57:17,530 --> 00:57:19,200
Yes,
it's nationwide yet.

1349
00:57:19,570 --> 00:57:24,570
Well,
different states can have different 

1350
00:57:24,570 --> 00:57:25,230
rules and federally they have different 
rules over what constitutes a,

1351
00:57:25,290 --> 00:57:28,840
how much pay do you have to earn before 
the overtime rules apply.

1352
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:33,900
What's also isn't a pretty arbitrary 
like this decision that's 40 hours a 

1353
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:33,900
week.
Yeah.

1354
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:33,900
Well,
like,

1355
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:34,810
everything the government does is 
arbitrary.

1356
00:57:34,811 --> 00:57:36,970
That's what laws are.
They have to come up with a number.

1357
00:57:37,210 --> 00:57:41,570
But all of this should be free for 
discussion.

1358
00:57:41,571 --> 00:57:46,571
You know,
it's interesting because you have the 

1359
00:57:46,571 --> 00:57:46,571
liberals believe that,
hey,

1360
00:57:46,571 --> 00:57:48,220
you know,
two people should be able to,

1361
00:57:48,410 --> 00:57:49,050
uh,
you know,

1362
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:51,700
have a relationship without the 
government interfering,

1363
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:52,370
right?
You know,

1364
00:57:52,570 --> 00:57:54,110
they can have a sexual relationship.
It's,

1365
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:56,370
it's none of the government's business.
Uh,

1366
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:57,350
you know,
who you're,

1367
00:57:57,351 --> 00:57:58,990
you know,
you're sleeping with well,

1368
00:57:58,991 --> 00:58:03,991
why don't they have the same belief in 
the same freedom when it comes to 

1369
00:58:03,991 --> 00:58:04,030
economic relationships.

1370
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:07,060
If an employee and employer or having a 
relationship,

1371
00:58:07,090 --> 00:58:12,090
why doesn't the government just butt out
and let the employer and the employee 

1372
00:58:12,090 --> 00:58:15,990
negotiate the relationship and the terms
of the relationship that they think is 

1373
00:58:15,990 --> 00:58:18,040
best for them because there are a lot of
workers that,

1374
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:19,450
oh,
I don't need the overtime,

1375
00:58:19,451 --> 00:58:24,100
but maybe there's another benefit that I
would prefer to have a that I could get,

1376
00:58:24,101 --> 00:58:27,610
but I can't because of government laws 
are requiring things that I don't want.

1377
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:33,180
So you're against minimum wage.
You're against essentially all these 

1378
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:34,150
government regulations in terms of what 
you paid.

1379
00:58:34,390 --> 00:58:38,030
The minimum wage is probably the dumbest
law that we talked about that on the,

1380
00:58:38,090 --> 00:58:40,690
on the last podcast.
But it's probably the dumbest law,

1381
00:58:41,110 --> 00:58:43,810
uh,
that you can come up with because all it

1382
00:58:43,811 --> 00:58:48,811
does is hurt the very people that you 
are intending to help you.

1383
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:52,750
You're hurting the least skilled people.
A,

1384
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:56,650
you're preventing people from getting 
jobs in the first place and you're,

1385
00:58:56,680 --> 00:59:00,910
you're creating extra incentives for 
employers to eliminate jobs,

1386
00:59:00,911 --> 00:59:04,990
to try to use capital instead of labor 
to try to outsource.

1387
00:59:04,991 --> 00:59:09,991
I mean,
nobody is going to hire somebody if 

1388
00:59:09,991 --> 00:59:09,991
they're losing money,
right?

1389
00:59:09,991 --> 00:59:14,881
People have a certain amount of 
productivity that they can bring to the 

1390
00:59:14,881 --> 00:59:18,190
table and when an employer makes a 
decision on who to hire,

1391
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:22,430
they have to hire somebody that brings 
them at least enough productivity

1392
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:24,180
to cover the wages.
And,

1393
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:26,220
and so what happens is when you haven't 
been in waves,

1394
00:59:26,221 --> 00:59:31,221
let's say the minimum wage is $8 an hour
and I'm an unskilled worker and I have 

1395
00:59:32,211 --> 00:59:34,910
to convince an employer to pay me $8 an 
hour.

1396
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:40,120
I have to also convince him that I can 
deliver more than $8 an hour of 

1397
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:43,040
productivity to his organization.
And if I can't do that,

1398
00:59:43,041 --> 00:59:44,540
I can't get a job.
Now,

1399
00:59:44,541 --> 00:59:47,420
what if I can only bring $5 of 
productivity?

1400
00:59:47,990 --> 00:59:49,430
Well,
that means you can't get hired.

1401
00:59:49,850 --> 00:59:51,100
Well,
I mean if I could,

1402
00:59:51,110 --> 00:59:56,110
if I only have $5 an hour worth of 
skills and I can't get a job to improve 

1403
00:59:56,110 --> 00:59:58,850
my skills,
I'm stuck in unemployment forever.

1404
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:04,000
I mean the worst thing you can do to a 
guy with minimal skills is prevent them 

1405
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:08,141
from getting a job because it's the job 
that's going to enable them to increase 

1406
01:00:08,141 --> 01:00:08,990
their skills so they can earn more money
in the future.

1407
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:14,240
I know what you're saying,
but the idea is that if you have a 

1408
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:14,640
minimum amount that you allow people to 
pay the least.

1409
01:00:14,641 --> 01:00:19,641
The people that are working for the 
company will have a real income where 

1410
01:00:19,641 --> 01:00:21,660
they can pay their bills and feed 
themselves and that this company,

1411
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:26,900
because they have all the power,
they have all the money and a poor 

1412
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:28,660
worker who's stepping into the market 
for the first time or you know,

1413
01:00:28,730 --> 01:00:33,420
just hasn't been been able to acquire 
job skills that would allow them to make

1414
01:00:33,421 --> 01:00:37,830
much more money per hour that they would
be taken advantage of by this

1415
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:43,360
corporations.
The corporations don't have all the 

1416
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:43,360
power because they're not the only 
employer.

1417
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:47,981
I mean,
all employers compete with one another 

1418
01:00:47,981 --> 01:00:47,981
for labor and um,
and,

1419
01:00:47,981 --> 01:00:48,980
and they bid up wages.
I mean,

1420
01:00:48,981 --> 01:00:53,981
you can't pay people less than the 
market value of their labor because 

1421
01:00:53,981 --> 01:00:54,980
somebody else will hire them,
you know,

1422
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:58,250
so that you could talk about,
oh,

1423
01:00:58,251 --> 01:01:01,640
wouldn't it be great if everybody can 
earn more money?

1424
01:01:01,690 --> 01:01:06,690
Has there ever been a proven example of 
this where they've had no minimum wage 

1425
01:01:06,690 --> 01:01:07,840
and it's been a financial boom?

1426
01:01:08,050 --> 01:01:08,740
Oh,
absolutely.

1427
01:01:08,741 --> 01:01:09,280
Well,
first of all,

1428
01:01:09,281 --> 01:01:11,320
we didn't always have a minimum wage in 
the United States.

1429
01:01:11,321 --> 01:01:11,590
I mean,
it,

1430
01:01:11,650 --> 01:01:12,010
it,
it,

1431
01:01:12,011 --> 01:01:17,011
it happened really in the 19 thirties.
But you can look at situations of 

1432
01:01:17,011 --> 01:01:21,151
countries that have no minimum wage and 
they have very low levels of 

1433
01:01:21,151 --> 01:01:22,870
unemployment and you can look at areas 
where the government using this.

1434
01:01:23,260 --> 01:01:23,800
Well,
I mean,

1435
01:01:23,830 --> 01:01:25,260
you know,
they don't have a minimum wage in,

1436
01:01:25,261 --> 01:01:26,320
in,
in Singapore.

1437
01:01:26,740 --> 01:01:27,730
Um,
and you know,

1438
01:01:27,731 --> 01:01:28,770
and there,
there are countries that,

1439
01:01:28,771 --> 01:01:32,020
since Singapore example though,
it's an extremely wealthy country,

1440
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:32,340
right?
Well,

1441
01:01:32,350 --> 01:01:34,880
that's one of the reasons they don't,
they,

1442
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:40,040
it's very easy to do business,
but you can look at examples where the 

1443
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:42,970
United States has imposed a minimum wage
on other countries.

1444
01:01:42,971 --> 01:01:45,520
I mean the minimum wages did a lot of 
damage in Puerto Rico,

1445
01:01:45,521 --> 01:01:50,521
but you know,
look at another American territory of 

1446
01:01:50,521 --> 01:01:50,521
American Samoa,
right?

1447
01:01:50,521 --> 01:01:54,211
American Samoa.
We basically destroyed American Samoa 

1448
01:01:54,211 --> 01:01:54,211
with our minimum wage.

1449
01:01:54,211 --> 01:01:54,920
I mean,
the Samoans are,

1450
01:01:54,940 --> 01:01:56,860
you know,
are furious about it.

1451
01:01:56,861 --> 01:01:59,260
This happened years ago actually,
and I,

1452
01:01:59,290 --> 01:02:04,290
the reason I even found out about it,
I was watching 60 minutes and they were 

1453
01:02:04,290 --> 01:02:06,370
doing a report about I think football 
players in Samoa.

1454
01:02:07,110 --> 01:02:12,110
And um,
and during their report they mentioned 

1455
01:02:12,110 --> 01:02:14,971
that there was a depression going on in 
Somalia and it was like there was 30 

1456
01:02:14,971 --> 01:02:15,160
percent unemployment and really high 
inflation.

1457
01:02:15,161 --> 01:02:16,750
And I was like,
what the hell is going on in Samoa?

1458
01:02:17,050 --> 01:02:22,050
So I wanted to research that on my own 
and I out that we impose the minimum 

1459
01:02:22,050 --> 01:02:23,190
wage on Samoa and we destroyed all their
jobs.

1460
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:28,340
They're,
the two biggest employers were to a 

1461
01:02:28,340 --> 01:02:29,160
chicken of the sea and starkist,
they were canning tuna.

1462
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:31,470
And then they were shipping the tune of 
back to the mainland,

1463
01:02:31,830 --> 01:02:33,690
but the minute they raised the minimum 
wage,

1464
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:35,790
they made the production,
uh,

1465
01:02:35,810 --> 01:02:38,700
uncompetitive because now you had to pay
the higher wages,

1466
01:02:38,701 --> 01:02:41,100
plus the shipping costs to get the tune 
it back to the mainland.

1467
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:46,520
So they all,
the canneries shut down and then it 

1468
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:48,270
created massive unemployment and then 
prices went way up on the island because

1469
01:02:48,271 --> 01:02:51,210
they no longer had boats coming back and
forth to pick up the tuna.

1470
01:02:51,390 --> 01:02:54,150
So now all of a sudden the shipping cost
of imports went way up.

1471
01:02:54,151 --> 01:02:57,150
So they had massive inflation,
sky high unemployment,

1472
01:02:57,270 --> 01:03:02,270
all because the minimum wage.
So you could look at examples of how 

1473
01:03:02,270 --> 01:03:04,200
minimum wage destroys jobs.
Uh,

1474
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:05,070
you know,
right there.

1475
01:03:05,071 --> 01:03:09,300
Yet they continued to advocate for these
higher wages because it sounds good.

1476
01:03:09,330 --> 01:03:11,910
Oh,
everybody should earn a decent living.

1477
01:03:12,030 --> 01:03:12,480
Well,
you know,

1478
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:15,510
not if you don't have any skills,
you can't until of course,

1479
01:03:15,511 --> 01:03:17,070
you know,
a lot of kids,

1480
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:18,210
you know,
they're 16,

1481
01:03:18,211 --> 01:03:19,020
17,
18,

1482
01:03:19,021 --> 01:03:19,740
19,
20.

1483
01:03:19,741 --> 01:03:21,180
I mean,
people live with their parents.

1484
01:03:21,181 --> 01:03:26,181
Still,
the most important thing is getting a 

1485
01:03:26,181 --> 01:03:28,100
job so you can acquire the skills to get
a better job to,

1486
01:03:28,130 --> 01:03:30,330
you know,
to move up the ladder in an organization

1487
01:03:30,331 --> 01:03:32,130
to enhance your,
you know,

1488
01:03:32,131 --> 01:03:34,710
your value to employers in general.

1489
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:39,090
What's the argument against this?
Against what you're saying about minimum

1490
01:03:39,091 --> 01:03:42,170
wage gangsta,
all these ideas that you're,

1491
01:03:42,171 --> 01:03:44,700
you're just proposing.
Do you do get a lot of pushback?

1492
01:03:44,790 --> 01:03:46,740
I mean,
I'm sure what you're saying,

1493
01:03:46,741 --> 01:03:50,190
this free market capitalism approach is,
you know,

1494
01:03:50,191 --> 01:03:51,330
there's a lot of people that oppose it.

1495
01:03:51,810 --> 01:03:56,810
Of course.
I mean there's a lot of people that 

1496
01:03:56,810 --> 01:03:58,521
don't think it out.
They think with their mind or are there 

1497
01:03:58,521 --> 01:04:02,090
others and they don't even get the read.
The origin of the minimum wage was 

1498
01:04:02,090 --> 01:04:03,780
racism.
I mean the first minimum wages here,

1499
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:08,960
it was designed to keep employers from 
hiring the Chinese are from hiring 

1500
01:04:09,031 --> 01:04:12,300
blacks because they know that that's 
where the minimum wage came from,

1501
01:04:12,540 --> 01:04:17,540
you know,
to try to prevent employers from hiring 

1502
01:04:17,540 --> 01:04:17,540
certain people.
So they said,

1503
01:04:17,540 --> 01:04:20,811
well,
let's have a minimum wage and that will 

1504
01:04:20,811 --> 01:04:20,811
reduce our hiring of people who have 
less skills.

1505
01:04:20,811 --> 01:04:21,130
And,
and,

1506
01:04:21,140 --> 01:04:22,650
and so,
and the labor unions,

1507
01:04:22,651 --> 01:04:27,651
the biggest supporters of the minimum 
wage are the labor unions and none of 

1508
01:04:27,651 --> 01:04:30,480
the labor unions workers earn the 
minimum wage.

1509
01:04:30,481 --> 01:04:31,830
So you might think,
why are they,

1510
01:04:31,860 --> 01:04:36,860
do they so care about the minimum wage 
if they don't get paid a lot higher 

1511
01:04:36,860 --> 01:04:36,860
than,
than wage?

1512
01:04:36,860 --> 01:04:40,970
And it's because you always have a 
competition between skilled labor and 

1513
01:04:40,970 --> 01:04:41,550
unskilled labor,
right?

1514
01:04:41,551 --> 01:04:45,630
So let's say a business,
a businessman has the option of hiring a

1515
01:04:45,631 --> 01:04:50,631
skilled person to do something and let's
say the skilled person is going to 

1516
01:04:50,631 --> 01:04:54,711
charge $20 an hour or an unskilled 
person and let's say I can hire three 

1517
01:04:55,681 --> 01:04:59,520
unskilled people for $5 an hour and that
equals 15.

1518
01:04:59,670 --> 01:05:00,300
Well,
Hey,

1519
01:05:00,301 --> 01:05:02,730
I'd rather hire the unskilled worker.
I can pay three,

1520
01:05:02,731 --> 01:05:05,880
$5 an hour to do the same job of one 
skilled worker.

1521
01:05:06,150 --> 01:05:10,200
But now if the skilled worker can,
could lobby for $7 minimum wage,

1522
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:12,450
now if I have to hire three unskilled 
people,

1523
01:05:12,451 --> 01:05:14,310
it costs $21.
Aha.

1524
01:05:14,490 --> 01:05:16,590
Now all of a sudden I hire the guy with 
skills.

1525
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:21,960
So the labor unions benefit by keeping 
unskilled people unemployed because they

1526
01:05:22,841 --> 01:05:25,630
have more skills and therefore they can,
you know,

1527
01:05:25,631 --> 01:05:30,631
they can get more work.
That sounds like a complicated mess to 

1528
01:05:30,631 --> 01:05:31,300
me.
It is a mess for the,

1529
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:36,480
for the,
for the people that get get priced out 

1530
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:36,480
of a job.
Yeah.

1531
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:37,400
Now Democratic Socialism is the thing 
right now.

1532
01:05:37,430 --> 01:05:39,050
This is the.
You're hearing it all the time.

1533
01:05:39,051 --> 01:05:40,310
You're hearing it constantly in the 
news.

1534
01:05:40,510 --> 01:05:41,810
What do.
What do you attribute that?

1535
01:05:42,050 --> 01:05:46,700
Do you think it's a frustration with 
this lifelong politicians?

1536
01:05:46,890 --> 01:05:50,750
Like what do you think it is that's 
causing this upper eyes and upswing?

1537
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:52,010
The woman,
what is her name?

1538
01:05:52,011 --> 01:05:53,390
That one in New York?

1539
01:05:53,830 --> 01:05:54,310
Yeah.
You know,

1540
01:05:54,311 --> 01:05:56,800
she's actually half Puerto Rican.
My mind,

1541
01:05:57,220 --> 01:05:58,600
my countrymen,
but yeah,

1542
01:05:58,601 --> 01:06:01,170
I forget her name and country.
Puerto Rico.

1543
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:02,140
United States.
No,

1544
01:06:02,141 --> 01:06:02,950
actually,
you know,

1545
01:06:02,990 --> 01:06:05,410
I,
I found this out as I'm traveling now.

1546
01:06:05,450 --> 01:06:07,270
You know,
I still have an American passport,

1547
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:12,720
but when I,
when I mentioned what country I'm from 

1548
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:13,330
and where you live,
I always have to select Puerto Rico as a

1549
01:06:13,331 --> 01:06:15,310
country.
Even though it's part of America,

1550
01:06:15,590 --> 01:06:20,590
it's still considered its own country 
even though you still are American 

1551
01:06:20,590 --> 01:06:21,970
citizens when you live there and you 
travel on a,

1552
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:26,180
on a US passport,
it's listed as a separate country from,

1553
01:06:26,181 --> 01:06:31,181
uh,
from the battle to the reader name from 

1554
01:06:31,181 --> 01:06:31,181
a twitter,
Alexandria.

1555
01:06:31,181 --> 01:06:31,440
Yeah.
And you know,

1556
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:33,220
Cortez,
28 years old.

1557
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:34,090
Yeah.
Well she beat,

1558
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:38,530
she beat a 10 term incumbent comment and
of course he was a white guy.

1559
01:06:38,531 --> 01:06:40,030
That's a,
that's a negative for him,

1560
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:42,370
which is,
but a woman of color.

1561
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:43,630
Yeah.
You know,

1562
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,690
Latina woman to actually.
Yeah.

1563
01:06:45,950 --> 01:06:46,660
So,
but,

1564
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:47,230
but,
but,

1565
01:06:47,290 --> 01:06:52,290
but the thing is people I think in that 
community are just voting at a 

1566
01:06:52,290 --> 01:06:52,540
frustration.
In fact,

1567
01:06:52,541 --> 01:06:54,640
I looked at her commercial,
you know,

1568
01:06:54,641 --> 01:06:56,530
and it's a very powerful commercial,
you know,

1569
01:06:56,531 --> 01:06:57,880
Kinda like,
you know about,

1570
01:06:57,881 --> 01:07:02,881
you know,
women like me are not supposed to run 

1571
01:07:02,881 --> 01:07:05,851
for office.
We're not supposed to have court when 

1572
01:07:05,851 --> 01:07:08,290
this whole bunch of nonsense.
But it's a story that I think resonated 

1573
01:07:08,290 --> 01:07:08,290
with a lot of people.
Like,

1574
01:07:08,290 --> 01:07:09,490
Hey,
let's stick it to the man.

1575
01:07:09,660 --> 01:07:10,590
Right.
You know,

1576
01:07:10,810 --> 01:07:12,430
and uh,
and that's what they did.

1577
01:07:12,790 --> 01:07:17,790
But I think that this,
this wave is going to be bigger than 

1578
01:07:17,790 --> 01:07:19,300
people think.
I think people are underestimating.

1579
01:07:19,301 --> 01:07:19,750
They're like,
oh,

1580
01:07:19,751 --> 01:07:21,430
this is unique because,
you know,

1581
01:07:21,730 --> 01:07:22,540
she,
um,

1582
01:07:22,630 --> 01:07:23,520
she's in a,
you know,

1583
01:07:23,530 --> 01:07:27,580
a heavily minority community.
And so that message work better.

1584
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:29,550
But look,
Bernie Sanders

1585
01:07:29,770 --> 01:07:31,290
read this here.
Jamie just pulled up.

1586
01:07:31,650 --> 01:07:34,140
She won in a district where she didn't 
even run.

1587
01:07:34,430 --> 01:07:35,650
Yeah.
Progressive candidate

1588
01:07:35,700 --> 01:07:39,300
also won a primary and our neighboring 
district in the bronx

1589
01:07:39,620 --> 01:07:42,080
as a write in for the reform party.
Oh,

1590
01:07:42,081 --> 01:07:43,370
well that's alright.
But she won.

1591
01:07:43,550 --> 01:07:44,980
She won.
Yeah.

1592
01:07:45,990 --> 01:07:46,670
I,
you know,

1593
01:07:47,110 --> 01:07:49,790
you think you could have two house seats
simultaneously,

1594
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:50,730
so yeah,
crazy.

1595
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:56,320
But the eyesight.
But if you look at Bernie Sanders 

1596
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:57,020
appeal,
it wasn't just,

1597
01:07:57,021 --> 01:07:57,740
you know,
you know,

1598
01:07:57,930 --> 01:08:02,930
poor people and minorities that were,
that were attracted to the sanders 

1599
01:08:02,930 --> 01:08:07,811
message.
And what was that message that was 

1600
01:08:07,811 --> 01:08:07,811
attractive?
It was,

1601
01:08:07,811 --> 01:08:07,811
you know,
it was,

1602
01:08:07,811 --> 01:08:07,811
it was,
you know,

1603
01:08:07,811 --> 01:08:08,150
giving ratios.
And we got,

1604
01:08:08,151 --> 01:08:13,151
we got to tax the rich,
we got a tax fusion of wealth and it's 

1605
01:08:13,151 --> 01:08:14,360
all about getting stuff for free,
right?

1606
01:08:14,361 --> 01:08:15,770
It's all about,
uh,

1607
01:08:15,771 --> 01:08:17,880
you know,
free healthcare,

1608
01:08:17,930 --> 01:08:20,450
free education,
guaranteed jobs.

1609
01:08:20,451 --> 01:08:21,220
I mean,
they want,

1610
01:08:21,300 --> 01:08:23,980
they want the government to guarantee 
everybody at chomp.

1611
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:29,060
Well,
that was one of the things that Bernie 

1612
01:08:29,060 --> 01:08:29,060
said that he could guarantee people,
Joe,

1613
01:08:29,060 --> 01:08:29,060
you can't hear in the country.

1614
01:08:29,220 --> 01:08:30,670
How's the governor getting guaranteed 
you,

1615
01:08:30,690 --> 01:08:31,880
first of all,
where's the government saying,

1616
01:08:31,910 --> 01:08:32,870
where's the governor going to get the 
money?

1617
01:08:32,871 --> 01:08:34,640
They did that in the Soviet Union.
Yeah,

1618
01:08:34,641 --> 01:08:36,890
everybody has a job,
but nobody makes anything.

1619
01:08:36,891 --> 01:08:38,600
And so everybody is poor.
I mean,

1620
01:08:38,601 --> 01:08:43,601
you can't say what they want to 
guarantee a $15 an hour job plus 

1621
01:08:43,601 --> 01:08:46,250
benefits plus vacation plus health care 
to do what?

1622
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:47,450
And of course,
what's the governor?

1623
01:08:47,451 --> 01:08:49,490
The governor's going to assign jobs to 
everybody.

1624
01:08:49,491 --> 01:08:51,140
What are they all going to do?
I mean,

1625
01:08:51,141 --> 01:08:56,141
people forget that we don't want jobs.
We want the productivity that result 

1626
01:08:56,661 --> 01:08:59,090
from the job.
So it's about productive employment,

1627
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:00,770
not make work,
right?

1628
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:03,110
We don't want it to government digging 
holes and filling them.

1629
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:04,530
We want real jobs.
And,

1630
01:09:04,531 --> 01:09:09,531
and how do,
how does the private sector know what 

1631
01:09:09,531 --> 01:09:10,160
jobs are needed?
It's demand.

1632
01:09:10,161 --> 01:09:13,190
It's,
it's individuals that want something,

1633
01:09:13,191 --> 01:09:14,930
they're guided by a profit motive.

1634
01:09:15,230 --> 01:09:20,230
You know,
the government that have governed 

1635
01:09:20,230 --> 01:09:21,571
doesn't make a profit.
There's nothing to guide them to 

1636
01:09:21,571 --> 01:09:24,221
efficiently allocate resources and how's
the government going to just figure out 

1637
01:09:24,221 --> 01:09:25,820
what people should do and just assign 
them,

1638
01:09:25,910 --> 01:09:27,410
okay,
this is the job you're going to do.

1639
01:09:27,411 --> 01:09:28,160
This is,
you know,

1640
01:09:28,161 --> 01:09:30,940
it would destroy employment in this 
country if,

1641
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:33,530
if you did that,
which this doesn't even make sense,

1642
01:09:33,531 --> 01:09:38,531
that you could offer everyone a job,
like you don't have those jobs first of 

1643
01:09:38,531 --> 01:09:39,350
all,
and the idea that,

1644
01:09:39,351 --> 01:09:40,700
well,
what are we going to do?

1645
01:09:40,701 --> 01:09:45,701
We're going to create x amount of 
construction jobs and x amount of 

1646
01:09:45,701 --> 01:09:46,400
dishwashing jobs and x amount of carwash
jobs.

1647
01:09:46,401 --> 01:09:48,710
You're not going to,
and where's the money gonna come from to

1648
01:09:48,711 --> 01:09:49,660
pay for it.
They're going to,

1649
01:09:49,700 --> 01:09:54,700
they're going to have to take the money 
from the private sector that would have 

1650
01:09:54,700 --> 01:09:57,821
created efficient jobs and they're going
to give it to the government to create 

1651
01:09:57,821 --> 01:09:57,821
inefficient jobs.

1652
01:09:57,821 --> 01:09:58,860
It's a disaster,
but the the,

1653
01:09:58,940 --> 01:10:03,940
the problem that I mentioned earlier is 
the economy is in bad shape because of 

1654
01:10:04,011 --> 01:10:09,011
all the government.
That's what go went back to the occupy 

1655
01:10:09,011 --> 01:10:12,251
Wall Street is that the people are 
protesting because there are serious 

1656
01:10:12,251 --> 01:10:17,170
problems in the country.
They don't realize that it's not 

1657
01:10:17,170 --> 01:10:17,720
capitalism that is creating those 
problems.

1658
01:10:17,721 --> 01:10:22,721
Capitalism would solve those problems.
It's government interference that is 

1659
01:10:22,721 --> 01:10:26,831
causing the problems that they're 
protesting and so the same thing with 

1660
01:10:26,831 --> 01:10:26,990
the socialists that they,
they,

1661
01:10:26,991 --> 01:10:29,480
they understand that their standard of 
living is falling,

1662
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:34,760
right?
Look at one of the things they want to 

1663
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:34,760
do is they want to give free education,
right?

1664
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:38,921
Because the liberals are all complaining
about the fact that college is so 

1665
01:10:38,921 --> 01:10:39,800
expensive and that students have so much
debt.

1666
01:10:40,370 --> 01:10:42,740
That's because the government,
before the government got involved,

1667
01:10:42,741 --> 01:10:47,741
college was cheap.
I mean government drove up the cost of 

1668
01:10:47,741 --> 01:10:50,270
college by guaranteeing student loans.

1669
01:10:50,270 --> 01:10:53,120
I mean that's how the government got the
votes of students.

1670
01:10:53,121 --> 01:10:55,070
They promised the students something for
nothing.

1671
01:10:55,071 --> 01:10:55,430
They said,
hey,

1672
01:10:55,431 --> 01:11:00,230
vote for me and I'll guarantee I'll make
it easier for you to get a loan to go to

1673
01:11:00,231 --> 01:11:01,040
college.
Right?

1674
01:11:01,041 --> 01:11:06,041
Well,
the minute colleges knew that people 

1675
01:11:06,041 --> 01:11:09,161
could get these loans.
They started jacking up the tuition so 

1676
01:11:09,161 --> 01:11:09,590
they could benefit from all this 
government money,

1677
01:11:09,770 --> 01:11:14,770
so the college has benefited.
The banking system benefited by making 

1678
01:11:14,770 --> 01:11:16,440
riskless loans at the taxpayer was on 
the hook for,

1679
01:11:16,770 --> 01:11:21,770
but the byproduct of all this cheap 
money being funneled that the colleges 

1680
01:11:21,770 --> 01:11:23,640
was that the colleges kept raising the 
tuition higher and higher and higher,

1681
01:11:23,790 --> 01:11:28,790
and then the politicians kept increasing
the amount of loans they would 

1682
01:11:28,790 --> 01:11:31,941
subsidize,
and so all of this is the fault of 

1683
01:11:31,941 --> 01:11:34,851
government.
The government created the problem that 

1684
01:11:34,851 --> 01:11:34,851
they're not complaining about,
but you,

1685
01:11:34,851 --> 01:11:35,130
the students don't understand that.

1686
01:11:35,130 --> 01:11:38,040
That's why college is so expensive.
Well,

1687
01:11:38,100 --> 01:11:43,100
no one sees a clear way out.
That's part of the problem and that's 

1688
01:11:43,100 --> 01:11:44,430
one of the reasons why socialism is so 
compelling.

1689
01:11:44,730 --> 01:11:49,730
It's like this seems like it's an 
alternative to what we're currently 

1690
01:11:49,730 --> 01:11:50,280
experiencing.
So people look at that and go,

1691
01:11:50,281 --> 01:11:51,890
maybe that's the solution.
I look.

1692
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:56,900
People want something different.
I said that's why trump was able to 

1693
01:11:56,900 --> 01:12:00,411
claim that he was going to shake things 
up and make America great again because 

1694
01:12:00,411 --> 01:12:02,460
I'm different because what's working,
what we have now is not working.

1695
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:07,410
That's why I'm so afraid that when 
people who voted for trump,

1696
01:12:07,950 --> 01:12:12,950
you know,
end up being disillusioned because 

1697
01:12:12,950 --> 01:12:12,950
nothing changes.
Their lives don't get better,

1698
01:12:12,950 --> 01:12:17,540
and you're completely convinced that 
this is going to be a crash coming in 

1699
01:12:17,540 --> 01:12:17,540
the next three years.
Yeah.

1700
01:12:17,540 --> 01:12:17,540
I mean,
look,

1701
01:12:17,540 --> 01:12:18,990
there's going to be a big recession,
right?

1702
01:12:18,990 --> 01:12:21,810
I think it's going to be worse than the 
2008 financial crisis.

1703
01:12:21,811 --> 01:12:25,740
I mean that because the government was 
able to bail everybody out that time,

1704
01:12:25,741 --> 01:12:30,741
they were able to print a bunch of money
and go deeper into debt and the 

1705
01:12:30,741 --> 01:12:34,041
financial crisis.
If you didn't have money in the stock 

1706
01:12:34,041 --> 01:12:34,140
market and you didn't lose your job,
it wasn't that bad,

1707
01:12:34,170 --> 01:12:34,650
right?
I mean,

1708
01:12:34,830 --> 01:12:36,930
you know,
you know you were fine,

1709
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:40,860
but this next crisis,
even if you don't lose your job,

1710
01:12:41,010 --> 01:12:42,780
you're going to be affected by 
inflation.

1711
01:12:42,990 --> 01:12:47,990
Prices are gonna go way up because I 
think this is going to be a dollar 

1712
01:12:47,990 --> 01:12:50,751
crisis.
This is going to be a sovereign debt 

1713
01:12:50,751 --> 01:12:52,761
crisis and investors were bailed out.
The government was able to bail out 

1714
01:12:52,761 --> 01:12:56,190
investors last time with quantitative 
easing and all tarp and all that,

1715
01:12:56,580 --> 01:12:59,370
but the next time investors are not 
going to get bailed out,

1716
01:12:59,400 --> 01:12:59,610
right?

1717
01:12:59,610 --> 01:13:04,610
They're going to go down for the count 
because if they try and I believe they 

1718
01:13:04,610 --> 01:13:08,241
will try to reflate the bubbles again by
printing even more money doing another 

1719
01:13:08,241 --> 01:13:12,741
round of quantitative easing,
it's going to destroy the dollar so 

1720
01:13:12,741 --> 01:13:14,580
they're not going to reflate the bubble 
in stocks.

1721
01:13:14,581 --> 01:13:19,581
They're going to prick the bubble in the
dollar and so when the dollar loses 

1722
01:13:19,581 --> 01:13:21,510
value and prices go up and you have 
stagflation,

1723
01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:23,630
you have a combination of a,
of a,

1724
01:13:23,660 --> 01:13:26,130
of a recession and inflation at the same
time,

1725
01:13:26,310 --> 01:13:31,310
and then of course,
what is the Fed going to do in that 

1726
01:13:31,310 --> 01:13:31,970
circumstance because they,
you know,

1727
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:35,730
their playbook is if you have recession,
you ease.

1728
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:37,770
If you have inflation,
you tighten.

1729
01:13:38,220 --> 01:13:39,720
Well.
What if you have them both together?

1730
01:13:39,810 --> 01:13:41,640
You know,
they just did these stress tests,

1731
01:13:41,730 --> 01:13:46,730
you're here,
these bank stress tests and the Federal 

1732
01:13:46,730 --> 01:13:48,030
Reserve came out and they said that all 
the banks passed.

1733
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:49,200
You know what?
What a shocker,

1734
01:13:49,201 --> 01:13:54,201
right?
The Fed came up with a test that 

1735
01:13:54,201 --> 01:13:55,260
everybody passed,
but if you look at the assumptions that,

1736
01:13:55,420 --> 01:14:00,420
that they made about the economy under 
the worst case scenario that they 

1737
01:14:00,420 --> 01:14:05,091
assumed interest rates,
tenure rates go no higher than three 

1738
01:14:05,091 --> 01:14:05,460
percent.
They don't go.

1739
01:14:05,490 --> 01:14:06,420
They don't,
they don't go down,

1740
01:14:06,421 --> 01:14:11,421
they just don't go up and they assume 
that inflation stays below two percent 

1741
01:14:11,421 --> 01:14:15,560
under the case scenario,
and they assume that the Fed is able to 

1742
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:16,120
lower interest rates to one percent to 
zero.

1743
01:14:16,121 --> 01:14:18,220
Again,
to stimulate the economy.

1744
01:14:18,430 --> 01:14:19,010
Now,
I mean,

1745
01:14:19,270 --> 01:14:21,610
what happens if inflation doesn't go 
down?

1746
01:14:21,611 --> 01:14:23,530
What if it goes up?
But if it goes up to five percent,

1747
01:14:23,710 --> 01:14:25,390
eight percent,
you know what?

1748
01:14:25,391 --> 01:14:28,090
If interest rates go up to five percent 
or eight percent,

1749
01:14:28,091 --> 01:14:29,860
10 percent,
what happens then?

1750
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:35,160
Right?
All the banks collapsed because what 

1751
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:36,540
happens if we have a recession where the
Fed can't stimulate because inflate,

1752
01:14:36,580 --> 01:14:41,580
they have to fight inflation or what 
happens if we have a recession and the 

1753
01:14:41,580 --> 01:14:45,151
government has to raise taxes during the
recession because the budget deficit is 

1754
01:14:45,151 --> 01:14:47,260
exploding and they don't have the money 
to pay the interest on the debt.

1755
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:48,970
What does happen?
Well,

1756
01:14:49,110 --> 01:14:49,520
well,
I,

1757
01:14:49,521 --> 01:14:54,521
I think that the political politics are 
going to play come into play and that 

1758
01:14:56,231 --> 01:14:59,680
the Fed is going to air on allowing 
inflation to run out of control.

1759
01:15:00,010 --> 01:15:03,360
They're going to do what they can to try
to prop up the economy and they're going

1760
01:15:03,361 --> 01:15:05,530
to sacrifice the dollar.
They're going to say,

1761
01:15:05,531 --> 01:15:10,531
well,
inflation is the lesser of the two 

1762
01:15:10,531 --> 01:15:10,531
evils,
but it's actually gonna end up being the

1763
01:15:10,531 --> 01:15:11,740
greater evil and member,
you know,

1764
01:15:12,070 --> 01:15:14,260
when Nixon imposed wage and price 
controls,

1765
01:15:14,261 --> 01:15:17,200
which was a very misguided effort.
And it's Kinda like,

1766
01:15:17,201 --> 01:15:19,000
you know,
what trump is doing with the,

1767
01:15:19,001 --> 01:15:21,070
uh,
with terrorists trying to cure the trade

1768
01:15:21,071 --> 01:15:26,071
deficit.
Rising prices are the result of 

1769
01:15:26,071 --> 01:15:26,071
inflation.
It's not the cause.

1770
01:15:26,071 --> 01:15:30,391
And so price controls don't work.
They simply try to mask the problem 

1771
01:15:30,391 --> 01:15:34,740
while it while it a while it gets worse,
but I think they're going to let 

1772
01:15:34,740 --> 01:15:35,080
inflation get a lot worse.

1773
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:39,700
And what that's gonna mean is that,
you know,

1774
01:15:40,300 --> 01:15:41,980
people need to prepare for that.
I mean,

1775
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:47,320
people need to do something.
We talked about that when I was on your 

1776
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:47,320
show before about buying gold,
you know,

1777
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:48,610
we talked about cryptocurrencies,
I talked about,

1778
01:15:48,611 --> 01:15:50,380
you know,
gold money and by the way,

1779
01:15:50,381 --> 01:15:55,381
this is when we talked about gold money 
on your show before and so many people,

1780
01:15:56,350 --> 01:15:59,110
this just shows you how many people 
listen to this podcast.

1781
01:15:59,470 --> 01:16:04,470
So many people tried to open up accounts
at gold money because of our 

1782
01:16:04,470 --> 01:16:06,160
conversation that the regulators 
actually shut them down.

1783
01:16:06,161 --> 01:16:11,161
They actually stopped them from 
onboarding new customers because there 

1784
01:16:11,161 --> 01:16:12,310
was too many people coming onto the 
platform and,

1785
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:13,810
and,
and,

1786
01:16:13,811 --> 01:16:15,930
and the reason that this is the bay,
this is this,

1787
01:16:15,931 --> 01:16:17,110
this,
the system that we're in now.

1788
01:16:17,111 --> 01:16:19,240
Because when you have a gold money 
account,

1789
01:16:19,241 --> 01:16:19,420
right?

1790
01:16:19,420 --> 01:16:24,420
It's not like just buying gold,
you have gold that you can actually 

1791
01:16:24,420 --> 01:16:29,340
transact in.
I can take my golden and I can send it 

1792
01:16:29,340 --> 01:16:30,340
to anybody I want anywhere in the world 
who has an account for free,

1793
01:16:30,550 --> 01:16:33,700
so it's like a money transfer.
So gold has to be actually stored.

1794
01:16:34,620 --> 01:16:36,670
Some real golden it.
Exactly.

1795
01:16:36,671 --> 01:16:39,100
There's gold stored in a brink's vault 
and you know,

1796
01:16:39,101 --> 01:16:44,101
they have vaults all around the world,
but I can transfer my ownership of that 

1797
01:16:44,101 --> 01:16:48,391
goal to you or anybody else,
but because I can do that now all of a 

1798
01:16:48,391 --> 01:16:50,110
sudden the regulations there because 
they're worried about terrorists,

1799
01:16:50,111 --> 01:16:53,470
they're worried about money laundering 
and so everybody who has an account,

1800
01:16:53,650 --> 01:16:56,650
there has to be a lot of scrutiny about 
those,

1801
01:16:56,710 --> 01:16:59,680
those accounts and those transactions.
Just like it was a bank.

1802
01:17:00,070 --> 01:17:02,860
And so this,
this and a lot of people got frustrated.

1803
01:17:02,861 --> 01:17:04,630
I got a lot of emails from people who 
were frustrated.

1804
01:17:04,631 --> 01:17:09,631
They try to open up an account and they 
didn't realize that it was the 

1805
01:17:09,631 --> 01:17:09,631
regulators,
you know,

1806
01:17:09,631 --> 01:17:10,010
they get mad at gold money because 
they're

1807
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:12,200
not opening up their account or 
improving their account,

1808
01:17:12,470 --> 01:17:16,400
but it's the regulations that are the 
cog in the machine.

1809
01:17:16,580 --> 01:17:18,180
But the good news is,
I think they've,

1810
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:23,240
they've made,
they've satisfied the regulators 

1811
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:23,240
recently,
they've come up with some new systems,

1812
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:27,751
so the process is a lot more efficient 
now for people to go online and buy gold

1813
01:17:28,131 --> 01:17:30,140
and you don't get,
you can buy know 25,

1814
01:17:30,141 --> 01:17:35,141
50 bucks worth 100 bucks worth of gold 
and you actually have another store of 

1815
01:17:35,351 --> 01:17:40,351
value,
another means of transacting with other 

1816
01:17:40,351 --> 01:17:42,440
people where you can have some 
protection against,

1817
01:17:42,441 --> 01:17:43,700
uh,
against inflation.

1818
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:44,990
And you know,
I showed you,

1819
01:17:44,991 --> 01:17:45,770
I have,
by the way,

1820
01:17:45,771 --> 01:17:47,180
they're sending you one of those gold 
carts.

1821
01:17:47,181 --> 01:17:49,150
I talked to him.
Yeah,

1822
01:17:49,290 --> 01:17:50,990
you,
I showed you this car that I have to do,

1823
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,880
have to send them some money.
So you're going to have to get,

1824
01:17:52,940 --> 01:17:54,890
I'm not sure if they're going to preload
your account,

1825
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:56,000
you know,
I went through,

1826
01:17:56,001 --> 01:17:57,800
you know,
I brought this card through the,

1827
01:17:57,830 --> 01:17:58,850
through the security today.

1828
01:17:58,870 --> 01:18:02,750
And of course every time I go through 
security with discard it rings.

1829
01:18:02,900 --> 01:18:05,240
So I always have to take my wallet out 
and put it in a,

1830
01:18:05,260 --> 01:18:07,220
uh,
in a little the little bin.

1831
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:08,550
And it freaked out,
you know,

1832
01:18:08,570 --> 01:18:11,120
they can never figure out what's going 
on because Satan and they see this thing

1833
01:18:11,121 --> 01:18:12,380
a metal,
they have no idea what it is.

1834
01:18:12,381 --> 01:18:13,400
So it's always like,
uh,

1835
01:18:13,820 --> 01:18:16,030
it stops me.
But it's a conversation piece.

1836
01:18:16,031 --> 01:18:19,100
But I had about three or four different.
A Tsa guys were all like,

1837
01:18:19,130 --> 01:18:21,250
you know,
looking at this card is that gold places

1838
01:18:21,290 --> 01:18:22,580
we'll go though.
This is pure gold.

1839
01:18:22,610 --> 01:18:23,360
It's actually,
this is.

1840
01:18:23,361 --> 01:18:23,930
Yeah.
This is,

1841
01:18:23,990 --> 01:18:27,890
this is a 24 karat gold.
So is gold mixed with metal,

1842
01:18:27,891 --> 01:18:28,940
right?
Mixed with steel.

1843
01:18:28,970 --> 01:18:31,490
It's not mixed with anything.
It's 24 karat gold,

1844
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:36,500
like gold.
It's also mixed with something else as 

1845
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:36,500
pure gold.

1846
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:36,500
Yeah.
No,

1847
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:37,610
that's like that.
If you go buy gold jewelry,

1848
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:42,640
right?
You're getting an 18 carat gold or 14 

1849
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:42,640
karat gold.
So how much does this card worth?

1850
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:43,940
It's kind of like 14,
1400 bucks.

1851
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,560
This would be an issue.
Melted down.

1852
01:18:45,980 --> 01:18:47,270
It's heavy.
Yeah.

1853
01:18:47,390 --> 01:18:48,830
But I mean compared to other cards,
but you know,

1854
01:18:49,070 --> 01:18:54,070
gold money,
another way that people can buy gold 

1855
01:18:54,070 --> 01:18:54,070
pimps,
labs,

1856
01:18:54,590 --> 01:18:57,140
they launched a company called Monet,
right?

1857
01:18:57,141 --> 01:18:58,700
The website pulled up.
It's a m,

1858
01:18:58,701 --> 01:19:03,701
e n e Dot Com,
and this is a great way for average 

1859
01:19:03,831 --> 01:19:08,480
people to own gold but also killed two 
birds with one stone because when you go

1860
01:19:08,481 --> 01:19:09,680
out and buy jewelry,
right,

1861
01:19:09,681 --> 01:19:13,370
and you buy typical jewelry,
maybe it's 14 karat gold,

1862
01:19:13,371 --> 01:19:18,371
18 carat gold,
the men a jewelry is 24 carat gold and 

1863
01:19:18,371 --> 01:19:19,850
they sell it by the weight of gold.
So if you,

1864
01:19:19,851 --> 01:19:24,851
let's say you went and you went into a 
department store and you spent a 

1865
01:19:24,851 --> 01:19:24,950
thousand dollars on a gold necklace,
right?

1866
01:19:25,190 --> 01:19:27,560
Maybe you'd have $100 worth of gold 
maybe,

1867
01:19:27,590 --> 01:19:32,590
right?
If you spend a thousand dollars at 

1868
01:19:32,590 --> 01:19:35,011
Manet,
you're going to get $800 worth of gold 

1869
01:19:35,011 --> 01:19:37,880
and manet will buy that,
that necklace back from you at any point

1870
01:19:37,881 --> 01:19:39,470
in time in the future,
two years from now,

1871
01:19:39,471 --> 01:19:44,471
five years from now,
10 years from now at whatever the gold 

1872
01:19:44,471 --> 01:19:47,321
value of the necklaces.
So let's say gold goes up by 30 percent 

1873
01:19:47,321 --> 01:19:51,701
from the time you buy the necklace,
you can actually sell it back to monet 

1874
01:19:51,701 --> 01:19:52,820
for more than you paid for it.
Whereas if you know,

1875
01:19:52,821 --> 01:19:55,610
if you have used jewelry that you buy at
a department store,

1876
01:19:55,611 --> 01:19:57,230
what's it worth on the secondhand 
market?

1877
01:19:57,280 --> 01:19:58,940
You know,
ten cents on the dollar,

1878
01:19:58,970 --> 01:19:59,930
right?
Twenties maybe.

1879
01:20:00,230 --> 01:20:05,230
So this allows people to have nice 
jewelry but also own real goal that the 

1880
01:20:05,230 --> 01:20:05,600
same time.
I mean,

1881
01:20:05,810 --> 01:20:07,920
you're going to pay a higher premium to 
buy

1882
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:09,870
a gold necklace.
I have a pair of gold,

1883
01:20:09,890 --> 01:20:12,150
a gold cufflinks that I wear,
my wife,

1884
01:20:12,300 --> 01:20:17,300
my wife,
where's this been a jewelry all the 

1885
01:20:17,300 --> 01:20:17,300
time.
She wears it every day.

1886
01:20:17,300 --> 01:20:17,300
And so it,
you know,

1887
01:20:17,300 --> 01:20:19,320
you can buy it instead of buying other 
jewelry,

1888
01:20:19,890 --> 01:20:22,950
but you know,
you're not throwing your money away.

1889
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:24,780
You're actually,
you're actually getting also p.

1890
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:29,900
But the point is that people need to 
protect themselves from the inflation 

1891
01:20:29,900 --> 01:20:31,950
that's coming because that is where 
we're headed,

1892
01:20:31,980 --> 01:20:32,270
right?
They,

1893
01:20:32,330 --> 01:20:37,330
the government is going to continue to 
print money to try to prop everything up

1894
01:20:37,501 --> 01:20:39,570
there,
try to delay the day of reckoning for as

1895
01:20:39,571 --> 01:20:41,400
long as they can.
And you know,

1896
01:20:41,401 --> 01:20:44,340
we've had a rally in the dollar recently
because people think,

1897
01:20:44,341 --> 01:20:46,200
oh,
the trade war is good for the dollar.

1898
01:20:46,350 --> 01:20:48,390
They're wrong,
it's a disaster for the dollar.

1899
01:20:48,540 --> 01:20:50,190
America can't win the trade war.

1900
01:20:50,190 --> 01:20:55,190
I mean,
we benefit from the trade deficit right 

1901
01:20:55,190 --> 01:20:55,190
now.
All we can do is lose in the short run.

1902
01:20:55,190 --> 01:20:59,990
If we lose access to all those goods 
that we're not having to pay for with 

1903
01:20:59,990 --> 01:20:59,990
exports,
you know,

1904
01:20:59,990 --> 01:21:02,520
they're actually trying to say that the 
budget deficit is going up,

1905
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:07,880
is good for the,
a is good for the is good for the 

1906
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:07,880
dollar.
When it's not,

1907
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:10,010
I mean big budget deficits are always 
bad for the dollar because it means that

1908
01:21:10,011 --> 01:21:15,011
government is creating more debt,
they're selling more bonds around the 

1909
01:21:15,011 --> 01:21:15,011
world.
You're,

1910
01:21:15,011 --> 01:21:19,280
you know,
the supply of dollars also includes the 

1911
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:19,920
surprise of treasuries.
And so if you're flooding the world with

1912
01:21:19,921 --> 01:21:20,600
treasuries,
you're,

1913
01:21:20,670 --> 01:21:25,670
you've got a surplus,
a dollar's a dollar is going to lose 

1914
01:21:25,670 --> 01:21:27,891
value.
And so people have to find a way to 

1915
01:21:27,891 --> 01:21:27,891
protect themselves and you know,
the average guy,

1916
01:21:27,891 --> 01:21:29,490
I mean,
gold is the easiest way to do that.

1917
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:30,520
You know,
and you know,

1918
01:21:30,521 --> 01:21:32,310
with the gold money account,
you could do it very,

1919
01:21:32,610 --> 01:21:33,600
very inexpensive.
Of course,

1920
01:21:33,601 --> 01:21:35,790
if you want to buy bigger amounts of 
goal,

1921
01:21:35,791 --> 01:21:38,130
if someone wants to put $50,000,
$100,000

1922
01:21:38,131 --> 01:21:40,170
with a gold,
I wouldn't spend it on jewelry,

1923
01:21:40,650 --> 01:21:42,630
right?
You could just buy regular goal.

1924
01:21:42,631 --> 01:21:45,790
I got a company shift gold,
right where I sell a,

1925
01:21:45,810 --> 01:21:46,970
you know,
maple leafs,

1926
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:52,040
Krugerrands us a US buying gold jewelry 
should be in addition to not,

1927
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:54,240
not a primary investment.
Well,

1928
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:55,890
because of the higher markup,
right?

1929
01:21:55,891 --> 01:21:58,350
When I sell gold bullion to people 
coins,

1930
01:21:58,440 --> 01:21:59,310
we mark it up,
you know,

1931
01:21:59,330 --> 01:22:00,240
one,
two percent.

1932
01:22:00,270 --> 01:22:05,270
It's a small markup.
The markup on jewelry is higher because 

1933
01:22:05,270 --> 01:22:08,511
we had to pay to make the jewelry.
It's more expensive to make a gold 

1934
01:22:08,511 --> 01:22:10,830
necklace or a gold bracelet or a gold 
ring than to make a gold coin,

1935
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:14,040
so you wouldn't want to have all your 
gold and jewelry,

1936
01:22:14,370 --> 01:22:16,530
but to the extent that you're going to 
buy jewelry anyway,

1937
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:21,680
you might as well buy real gold because 
now you actually have some savings that 

1938
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:24,420
has value in addition to having 
something you can wear.

1939
01:22:24,420 --> 01:22:24,870
I mean,
I don't.

1940
01:22:24,871 --> 01:22:29,310
I don't get a lot of value a day to day 
by having golden is safe,

1941
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:31,800
but you know,
if you're wearing it right,

1942
01:22:31,801 --> 01:22:36,801
I mean,
so then now you're getting an extra 

1943
01:22:36,801 --> 01:22:37,110
benefit from the fact that you have gold
because you now,

1944
01:22:37,111 --> 01:22:42,111
you know,
you get to enjoy it on a daily basis if 

1945
01:22:42,111 --> 01:22:42,510
you're wearing it and,
and obviously too,

1946
01:22:42,511 --> 01:22:47,511
if you don't have that much money,
if someone's not going to buy any goal 

1947
01:22:47,511 --> 01:22:47,511
that someone has a couple thousand 
dollars and that's,

1948
01:22:47,511 --> 01:22:48,930
you know,
they were going to spend it on jewelry.

1949
01:22:48,990 --> 01:22:53,990
Alright,
we'll spend it on gold jewelry because 

1950
01:22:53,990 --> 01:22:53,990
at least you still have the money,
right.

1951
01:22:53,990 --> 01:22:56,090
At least 80 percent of what you spent.
You still have a.

1952
01:22:56,160 --> 01:23:00,270
well it makes sense to me and I don't 
know much about gold,

1953
01:23:00,810 --> 01:23:05,810
but it's,
it's weird that gold is one of those 

1954
01:23:05,810 --> 01:23:05,810
things.
It's like universally been thought of as

1955
01:23:05,810 --> 01:23:05,920
valuable

1956
01:23:06,310 --> 01:23:07,880
like forever.
Yeah,

1957
01:23:07,881 --> 01:23:08,530
that's.
Well that's why.

1958
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:11,300
That's why it's money.
I mean gold is always been a or anything

1959
01:23:11,301 --> 01:23:12,710
else like that.
Let me.

1960
01:23:12,850 --> 01:23:14,740
There are other metals that had been 
used as money.

1961
01:23:14,741 --> 01:23:16,840
I mean,
silver has been used as money,

1962
01:23:16,860 --> 01:23:21,860
right,
but I mean gold has been the choice and 

1963
01:23:21,860 --> 01:23:23,230
it looks,
central banks own a lot of gold.

1964
01:23:23,350 --> 01:23:26,050
I mean not as much as they used to.
Not as much as they should.

1965
01:23:26,590 --> 01:23:27,810
Uh,
but central banks own it.

1966
01:23:27,820 --> 01:23:29,020
Gold's a monetary metal,
but,

1967
01:23:29,230 --> 01:23:31,450
you know,
gold is used in a lot of things.

1968
01:23:31,451 --> 01:23:32,060
I mean,
it's in,

1969
01:23:32,061 --> 01:23:34,780
in cell phones and computers.
It's used in,

1970
01:23:34,781 --> 01:23:35,300
uh,
in,

1971
01:23:35,310 --> 01:23:35,950
in,
uh,

1972
01:23:35,951 --> 01:23:37,900
in medicine and dentistry,
dentistry.

1973
01:23:37,901 --> 01:23:42,901
I mean,
so there are a lot of uses for it 

1974
01:23:42,901 --> 01:23:44,320
because gold has properties that other 
metals don't have that gives it value,

1975
01:23:44,380 --> 01:23:48,190
not just its physical beauty,
but also the things that you can do with

1976
01:23:48,191 --> 01:23:48,310
it.

1977
01:23:48,370 --> 01:23:48,740
You know,
you,

1978
01:23:48,741 --> 01:23:50,740
you can do things with gold,
uh,

1979
01:23:50,770 --> 01:23:54,250
that you can't do with other metals and 
gold is not going to tarnish.

1980
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:55,180
It's not,
it's like,

1981
01:23:55,181 --> 01:23:55,870
you know,
rust,

1982
01:23:56,130 --> 01:23:56,710
you know,
so it's,

1983
01:23:56,711 --> 01:24:01,711
you know,
you can make something out of it and 

1984
01:24:01,711 --> 01:24:01,711
it's not going anywhere.
Yeah.

1985
01:24:01,711 --> 01:24:01,711
You can also plate things with it.
Rallies.

1986
01:24:01,711 --> 01:24:03,430
You can take a small piece of gold.
You could play this entire table.

1987
01:24:03,490 --> 01:24:04,420
Exactly.
Yeah.

1988
01:24:04,421 --> 01:24:06,280
I mean,
I've never seen that happen,

1989
01:24:06,281 --> 01:24:08,530
but I've had it explained to me it seems
very strange.

1990
01:24:08,620 --> 01:24:10,240
Yeah.
The property is that it has,

1991
01:24:10,270 --> 01:24:15,270
you know,
no other metal can replicate and that's 

1992
01:24:15,270 --> 01:24:16,480
what are the reasons that it's been so 
desirable for so many years,

1993
01:24:16,660 --> 01:24:18,610
but it also makes it,
you know,

1994
01:24:18,670 --> 01:24:20,830
ideally suited to be money and that's,
you know,

1995
01:24:20,910 --> 01:24:25,910
one of the things that we know Bitcoin,
bitcoin is trying to digitally replicate

1996
01:24:26,440 --> 01:24:27,490
the properties of gold.

1997
01:24:27,490 --> 01:24:32,490
I mean,
that's the whole selling point of 

1998
01:24:32,490 --> 01:24:32,490
bitcoin.
They say it's digital gold,

1999
01:24:32,490 --> 01:24:32,490
right?
Um,

2000
01:24:32,490 --> 01:24:36,540
and it does have a lot of golds 
properties that helped it succeed as 

2001
01:24:36,540 --> 01:24:39,070
money,
but it doesn't have any of gold physical

2002
01:24:39,071 --> 01:24:41,530
properties that gave it so much value in
the first place.

2003
01:24:42,070 --> 01:24:46,480
And so you can't separate the intrinsic 
value of money from money.

2004
01:24:46,540 --> 01:24:49,180
Money has to be a commodity.
It has to have value.

2005
01:24:49,450 --> 01:24:51,310
And,
and that that's where bitcoin fails.

2006
01:24:51,311 --> 01:24:51,900
You know,
I just had it.

2007
01:24:51,901 --> 01:24:56,410
I had a debate.
I'm in New York and Soho last last week,

2008
01:24:56,890 --> 01:25:00,090
uh,
on bit coin a bit,

2009
01:25:00,170 --> 01:25:05,170
you know,
whether it was going to succeed and a 

2010
01:25:05,170 --> 01:25:06,200
replace if he at currencies and 
basically,

2011
01:25:06,201 --> 01:25:07,600
you know,
candidly,

2012
01:25:07,601 --> 01:25:09,580
I lost a debate,
but I think it was rigged.

2013
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:11,650
Was it really well because,
you know,

2014
01:25:11,651 --> 01:25:12,580
the way,
the way they,

2015
01:25:12,581 --> 01:25:16,040
they,
they decide to written the winter is um,

2016
01:25:16,750 --> 01:25:21,750
before the debate they have a poll and 
they ask everybody where they stand and 

2017
01:25:22,061 --> 01:25:27,061
then after the debate they asked them 
where they stand now to see if people 

2018
01:25:27,061 --> 01:25:29,040
changed their opinion and since 
everybody in there was,

2019
01:25:29,041 --> 01:25:34,041
it was a whole bitcoin audience and I 
had a confirmed to me from several 

2020
01:25:34,041 --> 01:25:36,010
sources that basically everybody was 
saying,

2021
01:25:36,190 --> 01:25:41,190
Hey,
make sure you vote this way before the 

2022
01:25:41,190 --> 01:25:41,190
debate.

2023
01:25:41,190 --> 01:25:44,850
So you can change your mind after the 
debate so that the pro bitcoin guy is 

2024
01:25:44,850 --> 01:25:45,540
going to win.
Why?

2025
01:25:45,630 --> 01:25:46,110
Yeah,
yeah.

2026
01:25:46,111 --> 01:25:46,990
Yeah.
So did you,

2027
01:25:47,020 --> 01:25:49,840
did the initially vote neutral or anti 
bitcoin?

2028
01:25:49,841 --> 01:25:50,100
No.
No.

2029
01:25:50,230 --> 01:25:55,230
So the proposition,
the proposition is we'll bitcoin replace

2030
01:25:56,590 --> 01:25:59,350
the dollar or other Fiat currencies 
right in the future.

2031
01:25:59,380 --> 01:26:02,530
But they wanted to propose it initially 
before the debate,

2032
01:26:02,580 --> 01:26:03,680
right.
Get your thoughts,

2033
01:26:03,890 --> 01:26:07,250
but they rigged it by having these 
people have contrary thoughts.

2034
01:26:07,251 --> 01:26:11,360
Before the debate was if bitcoin was 
evangelize to them,

2035
01:26:11,361 --> 01:26:11,780
like,
oh,

2036
01:26:11,781 --> 01:26:16,781
now I get it.
The idea is to have as like a bunch of 

2037
01:26:16,781 --> 01:26:19,040
people were in this debate that didn't 
believe bitcoin was the future,

2038
01:26:19,310 --> 01:26:24,310
but now after this hour debate,
they were convinced by my opponent that 

2039
01:26:24,310 --> 01:26:25,550
it was the future.
Because then,

2040
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:30,600
you know,
when I read all the stories and if you 

2041
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:30,600
go online,
you read the stories about the debate.

2042
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:33,560
It's always like Peter Shift last.
Peter gets bested shift loses.

2043
01:26:33,740 --> 01:26:35,090
So it's all.
It's almost like I got.

2044
01:26:35,091 --> 01:26:37,460
I got caught up in the bitcoin 
propaganda,

2045
01:26:37,490 --> 01:26:41,060
but this is so much like you want to 
talk about tribalism,

2046
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:44,510
bitcoin and crypto currency.
Those people are all in.

2047
01:26:44,580 --> 01:26:45,120
Oh yeah.
As I said,

2048
01:26:45,290 --> 01:26:47,830
my giant group of them that are just.
Yeah,

2049
01:26:47,870 --> 01:26:49,670
they're all in.
I said they're all in Puerto Rico now,

2050
01:26:49,671 --> 01:26:54,160
so I'm hanging around more of the crypto
guys than I used to.

2051
01:26:54,170 --> 01:26:56,330
And what is your take look?
You know,

2052
01:26:56,510 --> 01:26:58,490
I feel badly in that.
Well,

2053
01:26:58,491 --> 01:27:00,080
first of all,
some of them got very rich,

2054
01:27:00,081 --> 01:27:03,030
so I don't feel bad for these guys that,
I mean that,

2055
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:04,190
that got rich.
They put,

2056
01:27:04,191 --> 01:27:09,191
you know,
a few thousand dollars in and not 

2057
01:27:09,191 --> 01:27:09,191
millions of dollars,
you know,

2058
01:27:09,191 --> 01:27:09,191
I mean,
obviously I,

2059
01:27:09,191 --> 01:27:09,250
I,
you know,

2060
01:27:09,251 --> 01:27:10,850
I've missed out on that myself.
Right?

2061
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:14,210
I mean there's a lot of bubbles that I 
missed out.

2062
01:27:14,210 --> 01:27:16,310
I didn't make anything on the DOTCOM 
bubble.

2063
01:27:16,311 --> 01:27:21,311
I mean I made money when it came down.
I didn't make any money on the housing 

2064
01:27:21,311 --> 01:27:22,170
bubble until it went down.
Um,

2065
01:27:22,210 --> 01:27:24,110
and you know,
I missed out on the bitcoin bubble butt,

2066
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:27,430
but this bubble was tailor made for me.
If there was ever a bubble that I should

2067
01:27:27,431 --> 01:27:28,730
have been part of,
it was this one,

2068
01:27:28,731 --> 01:27:30,740
this was all,
it was all for the Libertarians,

2069
01:27:30,741 --> 01:27:32,150
right?
Free market guys,

2070
01:27:32,440 --> 01:27:34,700
anti a Fiat currency.
So,

2071
01:27:34,760 --> 01:27:36,350
you know,
I knew about it early on.

2072
01:27:36,351 --> 01:27:41,351
I mean,
not at the very beginning when it was 

2073
01:27:41,351 --> 01:27:41,390
like pennies,
but I knew about it before it was $10.

2074
01:27:41,450 --> 01:27:46,450
I knew about it when it was pretty low.
How much do you have invested in 

2075
01:27:46,450 --> 01:27:46,450
Bitcoin?
Oh,

2076
01:27:46,450 --> 01:27:46,450
zero.
Zero.

2077
01:27:46,450 --> 01:27:46,450
Yeah.
I mean,

2078
01:27:46,450 --> 01:27:46,450
I,
you know.

2079
01:27:46,450 --> 01:27:51,340
Oh actually no.
I got 50 bucks worth because no big 

2080
01:27:51,340 --> 01:27:51,340
spender.

2081
01:27:51,340 --> 01:27:51,340
Well,
you know,

2082
01:27:51,340 --> 01:27:52,100
what happened is,
you know,

2083
01:27:52,101 --> 01:27:53,390
after,
after,

2084
01:27:53,450 --> 01:27:54,480
after the,
uh,

2085
01:27:54,530 --> 01:27:59,530
the debate,
I went out to dinner with Eric 

2086
01:27:59,530 --> 01:27:59,530
[inaudible],
who is my opponent,

2087
01:27:59,530 --> 01:27:59,930
his wife,
my wife was there,

2088
01:27:59,940 --> 01:28:02,990
we had a group of people and so they 
gave me to show me how it works.

2089
01:28:02,991 --> 01:28:06,320
They gave me $100 with the bitcoin and 
then I gave somebody back 50,

2090
01:28:06,321 --> 01:28:08,600
but I kept 50 of it.
So I just in case.

2091
01:28:08,601 --> 01:28:13,601
Yeah.
Although now it's only worth 40 acres 

2092
01:28:13,601 --> 01:28:13,601
and it's gone down.
It moves all over the place.

2093
01:28:13,601 --> 01:28:13,710
Yeah.
But,

2094
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:14,570
but,
you know,

2095
01:28:14,630 --> 01:28:16,160
so I mean,
I don't feel badly that,

2096
01:28:16,161 --> 01:28:21,161
you know,
some of these guys looked into having a 

2097
01:28:21,161 --> 01:28:23,021
lot of money or you know,
it's luck or they took a shot and it 

2098
01:28:23,021 --> 01:28:23,021
paid off.
Right.

2099
01:28:23,021 --> 01:28:23,021
They,
they,

2100
01:28:23,021 --> 01:28:23,280
they got in and you know,
and the,

2101
01:28:23,350 --> 01:28:27,230
the market exploded and they have an 
opportunity to cash out at a profit,

2102
01:28:27,231 --> 01:28:28,760
but a lot of them are not cashing out.

2103
01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:30,560
They're gonna I think they're going to 
go down with the ship.

2104
01:28:31,010 --> 01:28:32,480
But um,
when,

2105
01:28:32,490 --> 01:28:34,310
when you say that you think it's going 
down.

2106
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:35,080
Oh yeah.
Cause it's,

2107
01:28:35,090 --> 01:28:37,940
it's look,
it's not going to succeed as money.

2108
01:28:37,941 --> 01:28:40,550
It's not going to work.
It's just a highly speculative asset,

2109
01:28:40,551 --> 01:28:42,590
you know.
And the last time I did your show,

2110
01:28:42,640 --> 01:28:43,820
I mean,
a lot of people are,

2111
01:28:43,850 --> 01:28:48,850
you know,
what Peter Shift got wrong on Joe Rogan 

2112
01:28:48,850 --> 01:28:51,251
about bitcoin.
I mean everybody thinks I don't 

2113
01:28:51,251 --> 01:28:51,251
understand it and that's why I don't 
believe in it.

2114
01:28:51,251 --> 01:28:55,960
It's because I do understand it,
but I don't believe that the people who 

2115
01:28:55,960 --> 01:28:59,080
think it's going to work,
they may understand the technology but 

2116
01:28:59,080 --> 01:28:59,360
they don't understand money.
Uh,

2117
01:28:59,361 --> 01:29:01,230
and so,
but what I talked to these people,

2118
01:29:01,231 --> 01:29:02,470
to me,
you know,

2119
01:29:02,700 --> 01:29:05,700
it's very much like a cult.
I mean,

2120
01:29:05,820 --> 01:29:06,620
they're,
they,

2121
01:29:06,621 --> 01:29:07,150
they,
they,

2122
01:29:07,650 --> 01:29:10,080
they believe so strongly in this.

2123
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:15,080
They're so caught up in the hype and the
hysteria and maybe they're blinded by 

2124
01:29:15,080 --> 01:29:16,680
the money they think they're gonna make,
you know,

2125
01:29:16,681 --> 01:29:17,310
when this,
you know,

2126
01:29:17,311 --> 01:29:19,960
these things are a million dollars a 
piece or wherever they,

2127
01:29:20,010 --> 01:29:25,010
they believed they're going.
So the thing that's going to think it's 

2128
01:29:25,010 --> 01:29:25,010
going to go to a million,
well there was an article last week,

2129
01:29:25,010 --> 01:29:27,680
some guy was saying 100 million,
$100,

2130
01:29:27,681 --> 01:29:29,160
million of Bitcoin,
you know,

2131
01:29:29,161 --> 01:29:31,640
that's why nobody wants to sell.
Right.

2132
01:29:31,650 --> 01:29:34,270
But the smart people are selling the 
people that got in early.

2133
01:29:34,271 --> 01:29:39,271
You're trying to con people into holding
on so that they can get out of $100 

2134
01:29:39,271 --> 01:29:43,121
million.
They're talking about $100 million and 

2135
01:29:43,121 --> 01:29:43,121
it's basically some numbers on.
Did they ever figure out who.

2136
01:29:43,121 --> 01:29:45,630
That's a Toshi,
Toshi.

2137
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:48,690
Dr Laura Nakamura.
Yeah.

2138
01:29:48,691 --> 01:29:51,030
I Dunno.
I mean I've been at the.

2139
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:54,150
I don't know why the guy hasn't come 
forward if it's a guy at all.

2140
01:29:54,150 --> 01:29:56,160
Someone said that they think it's the 
Elon Musk.

2141
01:29:57,010 --> 01:29:58,070
I don't know what.
Whoever you,

2142
01:29:58,080 --> 01:30:00,090
whoever it is,
you figure they've got a lot of bitcoin.

2143
01:30:00,720 --> 01:30:05,720
If they're real person.
I mean it might have been a group of 

2144
01:30:05,720 --> 01:30:05,720
people.
I bet.

2145
01:30:05,720 --> 01:30:05,730
Of course now it's not just bitcoin,
right?

2146
01:30:05,740 --> 01:30:10,740
There's 1500 to 2000 of these other 
cryptocurrencies will not just that 

2147
01:30:10,740 --> 01:30:11,130
there's a bunch of different ones,
right?

2148
01:30:11,160 --> 01:30:13,280
There's different variants.
Yeah.

2149
01:30:13,290 --> 01:30:15,960
And that's part of the problem because 
they think,

2150
01:30:15,961 --> 01:30:20,961
oh,
there's 21 million bitcoin and they 

2151
01:30:20,961 --> 01:30:20,961
think that that means they're scarce.
Well,

2152
01:30:20,961 --> 01:30:25,191
they're not scarce.
There's so many other currencies out 

2153
01:30:25,191 --> 01:30:25,860
there and it's only scarce because it's 
coded to be scarce.

2154
01:30:26,070 --> 01:30:28,500
Gold is scarce because it really is 
scarce.

2155
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:33,760
You know,
bitcoin is scarce because they decided 

2156
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:34,050
to make it scarce,
but it's not scarce in that bit.

2157
01:30:34,110 --> 01:30:39,110
There's nothing that any other 
cryptocurrency can't do that bitcoin is 

2158
01:30:39,110 --> 01:30:39,110
doing.

2159
01:30:39,110 --> 01:30:43,820
I mean,
but they're looking at it as an 

2160
01:30:43,820 --> 01:30:45,171
alternative not to gold,
but to the currency that we currently 

2161
01:30:45,171 --> 01:30:45,171
use.
Well no,

2162
01:30:45,171 --> 01:30:48,891
they literally,
they look at it as an alternative to 

2163
01:30:48,891 --> 01:30:48,891
both.
I think a lot of them,

2164
01:30:48,891 --> 01:30:49,800
although some people think it's maybe a 
compliment of goal,

2165
01:30:49,801 --> 01:30:51,780
but you know,
it doesn't have any actual value.

2166
01:30:51,781 --> 01:30:54,960
And that's where I get into a lot of 
arguments with these crypto guys because

2167
01:30:54,961 --> 01:30:55,440
they say,
well,

2168
01:30:55,441 --> 01:30:57,300
gold doesn't have any actual value 
either,

2169
01:30:57,540 --> 01:31:00,780
which is laughable because of course 
gold has actual value.

2170
01:31:00,990 --> 01:31:05,990
There are lots of things that I can do 
with gold and that shows that it has 

2171
01:31:05,990 --> 01:31:09,441
value.
There's nothing that I can do with 

2172
01:31:09,441 --> 01:31:09,441
bitcoin other than give it to somebody 
else.

2173
01:31:09,441 --> 01:31:13,251
I mean,
that's the whole purpose of it is to 

2174
01:31:13,251 --> 01:31:13,251
give it to somebody else,
but our whole economy's kind of screw.

2175
01:31:13,251 --> 01:31:14,860
It's entirely possible that it could 
shift over to,

2176
01:31:14,870 --> 01:31:16,950
as a Crypto,
coin based economy,

2177
01:31:18,130 --> 01:31:22,440
cryptocurrency based economy,
governments could certainly issue crypto

2178
01:31:22,640 --> 01:31:25,920
Fiat currency the same way they issue 
paper Fiat currency.

2179
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:30,920
In fact,
most of our paper currency transactions 

2180
01:31:30,920 --> 01:31:30,920
are digital anyway.
I mean,

2181
01:31:30,920 --> 01:31:32,100
how much cash do you use on a daily 
basis?

2182
01:31:32,101 --> 01:31:35,430
You use your credit card and uh,
and so banks are transferring.

2183
01:31:35,610 --> 01:31:40,610
They're not,
they're not shipping bills back and 

2184
01:31:40,610 --> 01:31:40,740
forth.
Mostly it's just numbers on a computer.

2185
01:31:41,060 --> 01:31:46,060
Uh,
so the government could certainly do 

2186
01:31:46,060 --> 01:31:46,060
that.
And I,

2187
01:31:46,060 --> 01:31:48,111
you know,
that that would probably give them even 

2188
01:31:48,111 --> 01:31:50,151
more control over the economy,
which is a negative thing because at 

2189
01:31:50,151 --> 01:31:51,000
least if you have cash,
I can,

2190
01:31:51,060 --> 01:31:54,180
I can give you $100 and the government 
doesn't see that transaction.

2191
01:31:54,181 --> 01:31:59,181
They're not spying on us.
But if they eliminated all cash and all 

2192
01:31:59,181 --> 01:32:00,850
transactions were,
then they would know everything I did.

2193
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:05,880
I mean,
every dollar I spent would be recorded 

2194
01:32:05,880 --> 01:32:05,980
on some government computer and you 
know,

2195
01:32:05,981 --> 01:32:07,750
that's something that I,
that I don't want.

2196
01:32:07,751 --> 01:32:08,320
And I think,
you know,

2197
01:32:08,321 --> 01:32:13,321
Libertarians certainly don't want that,
which is one way cryptocurrencies could 

2198
01:32:13,321 --> 01:32:16,730
backfire is if the governments end up 
monopolizing a crypto currency,

2199
01:32:16,940 --> 01:32:17,940
um,
and you know,

2200
01:32:18,070 --> 01:32:23,070
and an issue cryptocurrency alongside or
instead of the paper currencies that 

2201
01:32:23,171 --> 01:32:23,740
they issue now.

2202
01:32:23,740 --> 01:32:28,740
But I think part of the biggest damage 
that's ultimately going to come from it 

2203
01:32:28,740 --> 01:32:32,790
is when the cryptocurrency currencies 
collapsed and people lose a lot of 

2204
01:32:32,790 --> 01:32:32,790
money,
which is going to happen.

2205
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:38,040
Um,
the government is going to be able to 

2206
01:32:38,040 --> 01:32:38,040
say,
you see,

2207
01:32:38,040 --> 01:32:38,110
we told you to free enterprise 
capitalism is no good.

2208
01:32:38,111 --> 01:32:39,610
I mean,
look what happens when you trust,

2209
01:32:39,770 --> 01:32:40,240
you know,
uh,

2210
01:32:40,370 --> 01:32:41,810
you know,
the bit coin,

2211
01:32:41,980 --> 01:32:42,760
uh,
it's gonna,

2212
01:32:42,761 --> 01:32:47,761
it's gonna,
it's gonna help make the dollar and the 

2213
01:32:47,761 --> 01:32:47,761
euro and the yen look good by 
comparison.

2214
01:32:47,761 --> 01:32:49,720
Even though these are fatally fraud 
currencies,

2215
01:32:50,610 --> 01:32:55,610
they're still going to look better than 
the cryptocurrencies to the people who 

2216
01:32:55,610 --> 01:32:55,630
have lost a lot of money.
See Right now people,

2217
01:32:55,740 --> 01:33:00,740
there are a lot of people that like 
bitcoin because they bought it real 

2218
01:33:00,740 --> 01:33:01,300
cheap and even though it's gone down 70 
percent from its high,

2219
01:33:01,301 --> 01:33:04,680
it got up to 20,000
and now it's about 6,400.

2220
01:33:05,410 --> 01:33:10,410
You know,
there's a lot of people that bought it 

2221
01:33:10,410 --> 01:33:10,410
and still have big profits.
But what about the people that bought it

2222
01:33:10,410 --> 01:33:11,570
at 20,000,
18,000,

2223
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:13,360
15,000,
$10,000,

2224
01:33:13,450 --> 01:33:18,450
they're losing money and if it keeps 
falling and it goes down to 1000 or 

2225
01:33:18,450 --> 01:33:18,640
lower,
where I think it's going,

2226
01:33:19,030 --> 01:33:24,030
you have a lot of people that have lost 
a lot of money and so that's going to 

2227
01:33:24,030 --> 01:33:28,291
create a lot of problems.
And I think the government's gonna come 

2228
01:33:28,291 --> 01:33:30,661
in with all sorts of new rules and new 
regulations on transactions to try to 

2229
01:33:30,661 --> 01:33:33,010
protect us from ourselves is again,
it's just gonna,

2230
01:33:33,390 --> 01:33:38,390
you know,
try to make government look good in the 

2231
01:33:38,390 --> 01:33:38,390
free market,
look bad.

2232
01:33:38,390 --> 01:33:39,850
But you know,
people get caught up in frenzies all the

2233
01:33:39,851 --> 01:33:44,851
time.
It doesn't mean that the free market 

2234
01:33:44,851 --> 01:33:44,851
needs to be shut down just because every
once in awhile you know,

2235
01:33:44,851 --> 01:33:49,830
people get greedy and get nuts and it's 
not a reason to expand the power of 

2236
01:33:50,351 --> 01:33:55,351
government because government will do 
much more damage to an economy then 

2237
01:33:55,351 --> 01:33:56,900
small bubbles will do.
When you know,

2238
01:33:56,920 --> 01:33:58,960
when you have a boom and a bust because 
you have a mania.

2239
01:33:59,350 --> 01:34:00,080
Do you think that

2240
01:34:00,100 --> 01:34:02,380
there's any cryptocurrencies that are 
compelling?

2241
01:34:02,770 --> 01:34:07,770
Is there,
is there anyone other than bitcoin that 

2242
01:34:07,770 --> 01:34:07,770
you go,
well,

2243
01:34:07,770 --> 01:34:08,380
this one has a different set of 
parameters or different set of rules?

2244
01:34:08,460 --> 01:34:09,390
No,
because to me,

2245
01:34:09,391 --> 01:34:10,030
I mean,
you know,

2246
01:34:10,120 --> 01:34:12,240
you,
you just can't have a,

2247
01:34:12,360 --> 01:34:13,560
a,
a,

2248
01:34:13,561 --> 01:34:18,561
a digital token that you just create 
that's going to have going to be a store

2249
01:34:19,430 --> 01:34:20,070
value.
I mean,

2250
01:34:20,071 --> 01:34:22,470
money.
Money has to be a store of value.

2251
01:34:22,471 --> 01:34:24,330
It has to be a medium of deferred 
payment.

2252
01:34:24,450 --> 01:34:26,100
So what that means is,
you know,

2253
01:34:26,101 --> 01:34:28,740
I have to be able to take my money and 
save it for a year,

2254
01:34:28,770 --> 01:34:29,970
five years,
10 years.

2255
01:34:30,090 --> 01:34:31,830
I have to be able to make a loan.
Like,

2256
01:34:31,831 --> 01:34:35,430
I can loan you money,
I can't loan you a bitcoin and you say,

2257
01:34:35,431 --> 01:34:38,530
I'll pay the bitcoin back in 10 years 
because none of us know what the bitcoin

2258
01:34:38,531 --> 01:34:41,100
is going to be worth.
So how do you know what kind of interest

2259
01:34:41,101 --> 01:34:44,070
rate to charge a,
you need to have stable money.

2260
01:34:44,360 --> 01:34:49,360
Uh,
and I don't think any of these 

2261
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:51,021
cryptocurrencies can ever be stable 
because there's no real value to 

2262
01:34:51,021 --> 01:34:51,360
stabilize.
People say it's a store of value,

2263
01:34:51,361 --> 01:34:56,361
but there's no value to store.
So the only cryptocurrencies that would 

2264
01:34:56,361 --> 01:34:57,950
work would be crypto currencies that 
were backed by

2265
01:34:58,010 --> 01:35:00,350
a real commodity like gold.
And that can work.

2266
01:35:00,620 --> 01:35:05,620
But you know,
what gold money does is actually 

2267
01:35:05,620 --> 01:35:06,140
something better because you don't have 
to have a crypto currency,

2268
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:11,560
you just have actual goal.
See the reason that currency existed in 

2269
01:35:11,560 --> 01:35:13,460
the first place because currency was 
always backed by real money.

2270
01:35:13,670 --> 01:35:15,720
So let's say I had gold,
uh,

2271
01:35:15,740 --> 01:35:18,500
that I was storing at,
at a blacksmith.

2272
01:35:19,030 --> 01:35:21,590
I had a bar gold and I had a piece of 
paper that said,

2273
01:35:21,620 --> 01:35:22,570
you know,
you know,

2274
01:35:22,700 --> 01:35:24,980
pay to the bear on demand.
You know this bar gold,

2275
01:35:25,010 --> 01:35:30,010
right,
and it was written from a reputable 

2276
01:35:30,010 --> 01:35:31,130
blacksmith.
I could negotiate that piece of paper.

2277
01:35:31,131 --> 01:35:32,720
I can give you that piece of paper and 
say,

2278
01:35:32,721 --> 01:35:37,721
Hey,
I own some goal that this blacksmith 

2279
01:35:37,721 --> 01:35:37,721
take this piece of paper and now you own
the gold.

2280
01:35:37,790 --> 01:35:42,790
Right?
And and so that piece of paper is 

2281
01:35:42,790 --> 01:35:42,790
functioning as a money substitute as 
currency,

2282
01:35:42,790 --> 01:35:43,880
but the real money is in a vault.

2283
01:35:43,880 --> 01:35:46,010
It's gold,
but it's.

2284
01:35:46,011 --> 01:35:47,450
I can't.
It's hard for me to.

2285
01:35:47,510 --> 01:35:50,900
I can't break up that bar.
I can't just give you a small portion of

2286
01:35:50,901 --> 01:35:55,901
it,
but what gold money is doing is taking 

2287
01:35:55,901 --> 01:35:58,211
that old blacksmith concept and bring it
into the modern era because I can store 

2288
01:35:58,851 --> 01:36:03,851
my gold in a vault at breaks through 
gold money and now I can transfer any 

2289
01:36:04,761 --> 01:36:07,070
portion.
I can give you a gram of my goal,

2290
01:36:07,071 --> 01:36:12,071
that tiny amount of goal,
I can just send it to you for free and 

2291
01:36:12,071 --> 01:36:15,851
now you own that goal because now the 
ownership register is going to be 

2292
01:36:15,851 --> 01:36:19,421
changed.
And instead of being in Peter Schiff's 

2293
01:36:19,421 --> 01:36:19,421
name,
it's going to be in Joe Rogan's name.

2294
01:36:19,421 --> 01:36:24,250
And so once you can do that,
once I can take a bar of gold and and 

2295
01:36:24,250 --> 01:36:28,690
turn it into liquid money that can be 
used to buy a cup of coffee and you're 

2296
01:36:28,690 --> 01:36:32,190
doing all these without having physical 
control of the Gold Nano,

2297
01:36:32,220 --> 01:36:33,920
some physically holding it in your 
hands.

2298
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:35,120
It's in a vault somewhere.
Yeah.

2299
01:36:35,121 --> 01:36:40,121
Well somebody has to have physical 
control and that's what a lot of the 

2300
01:36:40,121 --> 01:36:42,000
bitcoin advocates don't like about 
something like a gold mine.

2301
01:36:42,001 --> 01:36:42,290
I said,
well,

2302
01:36:42,291 --> 01:36:44,840
you have to trust a third party to store
your goal.

2303
01:36:45,020 --> 01:36:46,820
Yes you do.
I mean,

2304
01:36:46,821 --> 01:36:50,510
but people have been trusting third 
parties with gold for thousands of years

2305
01:36:50,750 --> 01:36:53,840
and you know,
you have reliable third parties that can

2306
01:36:53,841 --> 01:36:58,160
hold onto something of real value 
because you have to have stability.

2307
01:36:58,190 --> 01:37:03,190
I mean that's the big problem that we 
have in the world today is we have no 

2308
01:37:03,190 --> 01:37:06,161
real money.
We just have these Fiat currencies that 

2309
01:37:06,161 --> 01:37:09,071
governments create out of thin air and 
there's no real stability in the 

2310
01:37:09,071 --> 01:37:10,190
monetary system.
If we had real money,

2311
01:37:10,191 --> 01:37:15,191
if we were on a gold standard,
which I believe we will be on again 

2312
01:37:15,191 --> 01:37:18,101
eventually,
because that is the norm throughout 

2313
01:37:18,101 --> 01:37:18,101
history,
is to be on a gold standard.

2314
01:37:18,101 --> 01:37:19,610
All these experiments with Fiat 
currency,

2315
01:37:19,611 --> 01:37:24,611
they don't work.
They haven't done in a gold standard 

2316
01:37:24,611 --> 01:37:24,611
since when the seventies.
Yeah.

2317
01:37:24,611 --> 01:37:24,611
We,
well,

2318
01:37:24,611 --> 01:37:25,400
we went off at 1971.
Of course,

2319
01:37:25,401 --> 01:37:27,800
you know,
w w we were on a pure gold standard,

2320
01:37:28,190 --> 01:37:28,850
uh,
you know,

2321
01:37:28,851 --> 01:37:32,090
in the 19th century and certainly the 
latter part of it.

2322
01:37:32,420 --> 01:37:34,610
Uh,
and even think we're going to go back to

2323
01:37:34,611 --> 01:37:36,890
that.
I think so because that's what works.

2324
01:37:37,070 --> 01:37:39,140
I mean,
what we have now works for government,

2325
01:37:39,141 --> 01:37:42,290
but it doesn't work for the people.
It doesn't work for prosperity.

2326
01:37:42,291 --> 01:37:42,650
You know,
when,

2327
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:46,970
when trump is out there trying to say we
have the greatest economy in history.

2328
01:37:47,060 --> 01:37:47,930
I mean,
it isn't,

2329
01:37:48,200 --> 01:37:49,340
it isn't even close.
I mean,

2330
01:37:49,341 --> 01:37:54,341
forget about the fact that it's not even
better than it was when Obama was 

2331
01:37:54,341 --> 01:37:54,470
president and he said that was an 
economic wasteland.

2332
01:37:54,740 --> 01:37:56,130
But go back to

2333
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:58,530
the period of time,
let's say 18,

2334
01:37:58,531 --> 01:38:02,630
70 through 1910 are in there.
I mean,

2335
01:38:02,820 --> 01:38:06,510
that was the golden age of America.
I mean,

2336
01:38:06,511 --> 01:38:09,960
that is what created the middle class.
The middle class was,

2337
01:38:10,130 --> 01:38:14,400
was a byproduct of the economic growth 
that took place in America.

2338
01:38:14,730 --> 01:38:15,190
I mean,
we,

2339
01:38:15,220 --> 01:38:20,220
we,
we basically had tremendous economic 

2340
01:38:20,220 --> 01:38:23,601
growth.
We absorbed tens of millions of 

2341
01:38:23,601 --> 01:38:26,810
immigrants that were coming from all 
over the world and they weren't coming 

2342
01:38:26,810 --> 01:38:28,200
here for welfare and food stamps because
they didn't exist.

2343
01:38:28,380 --> 01:38:30,440
There was no minimum wage,
uh,

2344
01:38:30,500 --> 01:38:35,500
you know,
there was just freedom here and people 

2345
01:38:35,500 --> 01:38:38,181
came here from all around the world 
because they can be freer in America 

2346
01:38:38,181 --> 01:38:41,211
than they could be any place else.
And it was those free Americans working 

2347
01:38:41,211 --> 01:38:44,980
with a gold standard with a solid sound 
money that created the greatest amount 

2348
01:38:44,980 --> 01:38:49,071
of economic growth that the world has 
ever seen in the shortest amount of 

2349
01:38:49,071 --> 01:38:49,071
time.

2350
01:38:49,071 --> 01:38:49,071
I mean,
people talk about,

2351
01:38:49,071 --> 01:38:50,040
oh,
how great the Chinese economy is,

2352
01:38:50,041 --> 01:38:50,370
but,
you know,

2353
01:38:50,371 --> 01:38:53,610
look back at the American economy during
that period.

2354
01:38:53,970 --> 01:38:56,430
And that was tremendous growth.
And I think,

2355
01:38:56,431 --> 01:38:58,770
you know,
we could have great growth again,

2356
01:38:59,030 --> 01:39:04,030
you know,
to the extent that we do substantially 

2357
01:39:04,030 --> 01:39:07,190
diminished the size of government,
but part of that would be to return to 

2358
01:39:07,190 --> 01:39:10,200
sound money and that would be gold.
But the cult of personality,

2359
01:39:10,290 --> 01:39:10,910
you know,
it's,

2360
01:39:10,960 --> 01:39:12,720
it's one of those things,
man,

2361
01:39:12,750 --> 01:39:17,750
I don't know this,
this is such a fascinating conversation 

2362
01:39:17,750 --> 01:39:21,981
because I would love to have a person 
who's equally educated on this stuff 

2363
01:39:21,981 --> 01:39:24,690
that opposes your viewpoint.
And I'd love to see.

2364
01:39:24,720 --> 01:39:25,350
Yeah,
well they're,

2365
01:39:25,351 --> 01:39:25,820
they're,
they're,

2366
01:39:25,850 --> 01:39:27,530
you know,
there's certainly people that have posed

2367
01:39:27,531 --> 01:39:29,040
my viewpoint.
There's no shortage of them.

2368
01:39:29,540 --> 01:39:30,310
But,
um,

2369
01:39:30,360 --> 01:39:31,070
you know,
you know,

2370
01:39:31,080 --> 01:39:33,420
I'd be happy to come on to show you 
don't think they're correct.

2371
01:39:33,480 --> 01:39:34,290
No,
no,

2372
01:39:34,291 --> 01:39:35,340
they're not.
They're not correct at all.

2373
01:39:35,370 --> 01:39:35,940
Oh,
you know,

2374
01:39:36,030 --> 01:39:41,030
before I forget too,
I forgot to bring this up because you 

2375
01:39:41,030 --> 01:39:41,730
mentioned it on the other podcast and 
you're like,

2376
01:39:41,731 --> 01:39:43,630
I wish somebody would come in and talk 
to me about it.

2377
01:39:43,680 --> 01:39:43,950
Like,
yeah,

2378
01:39:43,951 --> 01:39:44,550
that's.
Got It.

2379
01:39:44,570 --> 01:39:47,220
I got to talk about it.
Which is the act 20,

2380
01:39:47,250 --> 01:39:52,250
22 in Puerto Rico and whether or not 
Puerto Rico is in trouble because you 

2381
01:39:52,250 --> 01:39:53,880
have a bunch of rich people who were 
there who are not paying taxes.

2382
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:54,730
Yeah.
That was the,

2383
01:39:54,731 --> 01:39:55,560
the charge,
right?

2384
01:39:55,561 --> 01:40:00,561
The reason why it was so difficult to 
rebuild the infrastructure post Maria 

2385
01:40:00,561 --> 01:40:05,240
was that all you rich guys come there 
and soaked up the economy and that's why

2386
01:40:05,791 --> 01:40:07,980
you're there because you weren't paying 
any taxes.

2387
01:40:08,010 --> 01:40:09,180
Yeah.
And so first of all,

2388
01:40:09,230 --> 01:40:09,990
the,
the,

2389
01:40:10,230 --> 01:40:13,380
the,
the tax breaks didn't start until 2012.

2390
01:40:14,160 --> 01:40:17,010
And before that,
what was going on in the same,

2391
01:40:17,190 --> 01:40:17,820
it changed.

2392
01:40:17,850 --> 01:40:19,350
Well,
if you were rich in Puerto Rico,

2393
01:40:19,351 --> 01:40:22,920
you paid the same 30 percent tax,
federal tax.

2394
01:40:22,921 --> 01:40:25,710
Everybody else,
nobody in Puerto Rico has to pay federal

2395
01:40:25,711 --> 01:40:30,711
income taxes.
That is one of the big benefits that 

2396
01:40:30,711 --> 01:40:30,990
Puerto Rico has.
You don't have to pay the federal income

2397
01:40:30,991 --> 01:40:33,780
tax if you live there when you're 
working there on the money you earned.

2398
01:40:34,410 --> 01:40:39,150
So if I had moved to Puerto Rico in 2010
or 2011,

2399
01:40:39,180 --> 01:40:41,580
which I did not do,
but how do I move there?

2400
01:40:41,581 --> 01:40:46,581
Then I would have had to pay the same 
high Puerto Rican income tax that 

2401
01:40:46,581 --> 01:40:50,211
everybody else in Puerto Rico's pain.
But what enticed a lot of people to move

2402
01:40:50,311 --> 01:40:52,920
to Puerto Rico was the fact that they 
reduced the taxes.

2403
01:40:53,260 --> 01:40:55,300
Now the taxes are in zero,
right?

2404
01:40:55,720 --> 01:40:57,190
You,
if you come there,

2405
01:40:57,400 --> 01:41:02,400
you're still gonna pay taxes.
I'm on some of the money that you 

2406
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:07,231
weren't like my,
my business pays a four percent 

2407
01:41:07,231 --> 01:41:07,231
corporate tax.

2408
01:41:07,231 --> 01:41:10,650
So it's not zero pay four percent.
I can give myself a dividend that's tax 

2409
01:41:10,650 --> 01:41:12,820
free,
but the corporations are required to pay

2410
01:41:12,821 --> 01:41:15,700
out a certain amount of taxable salary 
to the owners.

2411
01:41:15,790 --> 01:41:20,200
So some of my salary is taxed as high as
30 percent.

2412
01:41:20,590 --> 01:41:23,950
The majority of it is taxed basically at
the four percent,

2413
01:41:23,951 --> 01:41:27,520
but four percent of something is better 
than 30 percent of nothing.

2414
01:41:27,760 --> 01:41:29,590
Plus they're getting 30 percent of 
something.

2415
01:41:29,740 --> 01:41:33,970
So a lot of the people who have moved to
Puerto Rico over the last,

2416
01:41:33,990 --> 01:41:34,510
you know,
five,

2417
01:41:34,511 --> 01:41:39,511
six,
seven years that didn't live there 

2418
01:41:39,511 --> 01:41:41,341
before,
are paying a lot of taxes now to the 

2419
01:41:41,341 --> 01:41:43,270
Puerto Rican government,
even though the rate is very low,

2420
01:41:43,480 --> 01:41:48,480
the dollar amount is very high and each 
individual person who was moved there is

2421
01:41:49,001 --> 01:41:52,660
paying a lot more taxes than the average
Puerto Rican who's already living there,

2422
01:41:52,870 --> 01:41:53,740
paying the higher rate.

2423
01:41:53,740 --> 01:41:58,740
So the people who moved there bought,
brought significant tax revenue that 

2424
01:41:58,740 --> 01:42:00,310
Puerto Rico never was going to get.
Because remember,

2425
01:42:00,311 --> 01:42:02,290
if they were taxing people at 30 
percent,

2426
01:42:02,500 --> 01:42:05,800
people from California wouldn't have 
moved their people from New York.

2427
01:42:06,160 --> 01:42:07,870
People from New Jersey wouldn't have 
moved there.

2428
01:42:07,990 --> 01:42:12,990
It was the low taxes that brought all 
these people to Puerto Rico who never 

2429
01:42:12,990 --> 01:42:14,230
would have been there.
And they're now paying taxes.

2430
01:42:14,290 --> 01:42:19,290
But more importantly,
they're hiring people who are also 

2431
01:42:19,290 --> 01:42:22,291
paying taxes.
They're spending a lot of money locally 

2432
01:42:22,291 --> 01:42:23,830
in the economy generating revenue and 
jobs.

2433
01:42:24,050 --> 01:42:25,720
Uh,
so they've been a big plus.

2434
01:42:25,900 --> 01:42:29,230
And I can tell you the people who have 
moved their,

2435
01:42:29,231 --> 01:42:34,231
myself included,
we donated a lot of money to the relief 

2436
01:42:34,231 --> 01:42:38,191
efforts.
I mean as soon as that hurricane was 

2437
01:42:38,191 --> 01:42:38,191
over,
a lot of the acts 20,

2438
01:42:38,191 --> 01:42:42,091
22 people,
which is what they'd be called because 

2439
01:42:42,091 --> 01:42:42,091
they went there to participate.

2440
01:42:42,091 --> 01:42:44,230
They were raising money.
They were helping out.

2441
01:42:44,231 --> 01:42:46,540
I mean,
so there's a lot of charity that came to

2442
01:42:46,541 --> 01:42:51,541
Puerto Rico that a lot of these people,
they wouldn't have thought of it that 

2443
01:42:51,541 --> 01:42:54,571
they didn't already live there.
But by bringing a lot of wealthy people 

2444
01:42:54,571 --> 01:42:55,330
down there to Puerto Rico and they're,
they're living it,

2445
01:42:55,630 --> 01:43:00,630
you know,
they're more inclined to help out their 

2446
01:43:00,630 --> 01:43:00,630
neighbors then when they were still 
living in the US.

2447
01:43:00,630 --> 01:43:05,110
So Puerto Rico has derive significant 
benefit from an influx of wealthy 

2448
01:43:05,981 --> 01:43:10,981
entrepreneurs who have taken advantage 
of them and that you move in there and 

2449
01:43:11,621 --> 01:43:15,400
just exploiting that place by getting 
paid and low taxes and that it's,

2450
01:43:15,520 --> 01:43:20,520
it's a,
it's a bad thing for the people that 

2451
01:43:20,520 --> 01:43:20,520
live there.
That's a false still.

2452
01:43:20,520 --> 01:43:22,930
It's a great thing for the people that 
lived there because people are coming to

2453
01:43:22,931 --> 01:43:24,820
the island,
bringing capital,

2454
01:43:25,060 --> 01:43:28,180
bringing businesses,
bringing employment opportunities,

2455
01:43:28,390 --> 01:43:30,670
paying taxes that they never would have 
paid.

2456
01:43:30,720 --> 01:43:32,800
And let me ask you,
is key you ever anticipated.

2457
01:43:32,801 --> 01:43:37,801
I mean it seems,
what is Puerto Rico as big as any state 

2458
01:43:37,801 --> 01:43:38,080
is as big as Rhode Island?
Like how big?

2459
01:43:38,360 --> 01:43:39,480
It's small.
I mean,

2460
01:43:39,481 --> 01:43:44,481
I mean geographically it may be about 
the size is like 30 miles maybe and 

2461
01:43:44,481 --> 01:43:46,060
that's the length.
It's skinnier than that.

2462
01:43:46,240 --> 01:43:49,120
So it's,
it's a small place but you know,

2463
01:43:49,121 --> 01:43:54,121
relative to the Caribbean.
I mean if you compare it to other 

2464
01:43:54,121 --> 01:43:54,121
Caribbean islands,
it's pretty big.

2465
01:43:54,121 --> 01:43:55,610
How long is the flight from New York to 
Puerto Rico?

2466
01:43:55,970 --> 01:43:57,710
Actually in the air it's about three 
hours,

2467
01:43:57,740 --> 01:43:58,970
but I think the airlines,
you know,

2468
01:43:58,971 --> 01:44:00,130
they leave about four.
You know,

2469
01:44:00,150 --> 01:44:05,150
if you look at the flight time,
but actually from wheels up to wheels 

2470
01:44:05,150 --> 01:44:05,900
down,
it's about a three hour flight.

2471
01:44:05,901 --> 01:44:07,940
So it's not far and there,
you know,

2472
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:11,720
there are a lot of places that you can 
fly direct to go to the west coast.

2473
01:44:11,750 --> 01:44:12,430
No,
you gotTa,

2474
01:44:12,440 --> 01:44:17,440
you know you got it.
Would there be a way that all these 

2475
01:44:17,440 --> 01:44:20,120
people coming in,
they could somehow or another fix this,

2476
01:44:20,670 --> 01:44:23,150
the whole electrical system that they 
have their,

2477
01:44:23,151 --> 01:44:24,890
their power grid and.
Yeah,

2478
01:44:24,891 --> 01:44:26,210
look,
the power grid,

2479
01:44:26,211 --> 01:44:29,720
this just shows you all the people that 
think socialism is so great.

2480
01:44:30,170 --> 01:44:33,050
Look at Puerto Rico.
That's why they're broke,

2481
01:44:33,320 --> 01:44:36,200
right?
The socialist destroyed Puerto Rico,

2482
01:44:36,320 --> 01:44:41,320
the socialist in Puerto Rico,
and of course the ones that we have in 

2483
01:44:41,320 --> 01:44:42,680
Washington because all their problems 
aren't self inflicted,

2484
01:44:42,980 --> 01:44:46,400
but we created a problem for Puerto Rico
a number,

2485
01:44:46,490 --> 01:44:48,320
a number of ways.
First of all,

2486
01:44:48,410 --> 01:44:50,330
right?
We have the minimum wage that,

2487
01:44:50,490 --> 01:44:55,490
you know,
the average income in Puerto Rico is 

2488
01:44:55,490 --> 01:44:55,700
half of the poorest state in the United 
States,

2489
01:44:56,060 --> 01:44:57,200
which I forget.
I forget,

2490
01:44:57,201 --> 01:44:58,970
which is the poorest states like 
Kentucky,

2491
01:44:58,971 --> 01:45:00,280
Kentucky maybe,
but it's,

2492
01:45:00,390 --> 01:45:02,210
it's half of half of that.
Right?

2493
01:45:02,210 --> 01:45:05,330
But now you've got a minimum wage that's
the same as Kentucky,

2494
01:45:05,630 --> 01:45:09,500
so it is basically keeping a lot more 
people unemployed.

2495
01:45:09,650 --> 01:45:11,450
But then you have,
you still have welfare,

2496
01:45:11,451 --> 01:45:13,550
you still have food stamps,
so you have all these people.

2497
01:45:13,551 --> 01:45:16,820
Now that are not working because they're
getting paid by the government,

2498
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:18,740
but then you have the Puerto Rican 
government,

2499
01:45:18,741 --> 01:45:23,741
which is a major employer of gay people 
work for the government and a lot of 

2500
01:45:23,741 --> 01:45:25,100
them are just doing nonsense,
right?

2501
01:45:25,101 --> 01:45:28,250
I mean there's so many people that are 
working for the government.

2502
01:45:28,520 --> 01:45:33,520
They're not productive,
but they're draining resources from the 

2503
01:45:33,520 --> 01:45:33,520
Puerto Rican economy.
I mean,

2504
01:45:33,520 --> 01:45:35,110
part of it was a power company.
You know,

2505
01:45:35,150 --> 01:45:37,940
you mean it's a disaster,
but the government is running everything

2506
01:45:37,941 --> 01:45:42,941
there and so everything is inefficient 
and meanwhile a lot of the productive 

2507
01:45:42,941 --> 01:45:47,591
people,
people who want jobs have left the 

2508
01:45:47,591 --> 01:45:47,591
island.
Like if you think a high minimum wages,

2509
01:45:47,591 --> 01:45:47,591
great.

2510
01:45:47,630 --> 01:45:52,070
All the people who are leaving Puerto 
Rico to go to Florida are effectively,

2511
01:45:52,071 --> 01:45:57,071
even though it's the same minimum wage,
they're actually going to a state that 

2512
01:45:57,071 --> 01:46:00,011
has a much lower minimum wage relative 
to the medium wage because they can get 

2513
01:46:00,011 --> 01:46:03,230
jobs in Florida.
They can't get them in in Puerto Rico.

2514
01:46:03,590 --> 01:46:08,590
So you have that situation where you 
know very few people are actually 

2515
01:46:08,590 --> 01:46:09,560
employees so you don't have a real tax 
space.

2516
01:46:09,920 --> 01:46:14,920
And then what America did,
but really screwed them over was we made

2517
01:46:15,021 --> 01:46:17,960
all their bonds triple tax free.
We said,

2518
01:46:17,961 --> 01:46:22,961
if you're,
if you live in New York and you buy 

2519
01:46:22,961 --> 01:46:25,520
Puerto Rican government bonds,
you're not going to pay any local income

2520
01:46:25,521 --> 01:46:30,521
taxes.
You're not going to pay any federal 

2521
01:46:30,521 --> 01:46:30,521
income taxes.
It's all tax free.

2522
01:46:30,521 --> 01:46:32,450
Now,
if you loan money to a poor Puerto Rican

2523
01:46:32,451 --> 01:46:33,830
company,
right?

2524
01:46:33,831 --> 01:46:36,140
If you loan money to a private business 
in Puerto Rico,

2525
01:46:36,141 --> 01:46:38,510
you got to pay taxes on whatever.
They pay you an interest.

2526
01:46:38,690 --> 01:46:40,790
But if you loan money to the Puerto 
Rican government,

2527
01:46:41,060 --> 01:46:46,060
the interest is tax free.
So America subsidized invest in loaning 

2528
01:46:46,060 --> 01:46:48,890
money to the government in Puerto Rico,
but not to the private.

2529
01:46:49,620 --> 01:46:50,010
And so they

2530
01:46:50,010 --> 01:46:55,010
made it very easy for Puerto Rican 
politicians to go into debt because all 

2531
01:46:55,010 --> 01:46:59,271
these Muni bond funds all over the 
country needed Puerto Rican paper to 

2532
01:46:59,271 --> 01:47:01,800
increase the yield on their fund.
So you have everybody wants Puerto Rican

2533
01:47:01,801 --> 01:47:06,801
government bonds.
So the Puerto Rican government is 

2534
01:47:06,801 --> 01:47:06,801
creating these bonds and they can now 
buy votes.

2535
01:47:06,801 --> 01:47:09,540
They can promise all sorts of goodies to
people who vote for them.

2536
01:47:09,630 --> 01:47:12,510
They can overpay government workers,
give them all sorts of holidays,

2537
01:47:12,511 --> 01:47:17,511
right?
Lots of time off and they can keep 

2538
01:47:17,511 --> 01:47:19,450
borrowing money so they got deeper and 
deeper into debt because we created a,

2539
01:47:19,520 --> 01:47:24,520
an incentive for them to do that and and
now they have a debt crisis because all 

2540
01:47:24,520 --> 01:47:29,211
of a sudden Puerto Rican bondholders 
realize that Puerto Rico is never going 

2541
01:47:29,211 --> 01:47:32,801
to pay back their money.
And then the other thing that we did to 

2542
01:47:32,801 --> 01:47:34,230
them and I talked about,
I think on the show is the Jones Act,

2543
01:47:34,470 --> 01:47:39,470
which if you remember trump suspended it
for like a week or two after Maria,

2544
01:47:40,110 --> 01:47:43,260
but the Jones act should be completely 
repealed.

2545
01:47:43,260 --> 01:47:45,830
And especially if donald trump's going 
to be talking about,

2546
01:47:46,770 --> 01:47:49,020
well,
there's a number of aspects of it,

2547
01:47:49,021 --> 01:47:54,021
but the most significant to Puerto Rico 
is that the Jones Act says that if you 

2548
01:47:56,191 --> 01:48:00,930
want to transport goods from one US port
to another us port,

2549
01:48:01,530 --> 01:48:03,870
it has to be an American ship,
right?

2550
01:48:03,960 --> 01:48:06,210
So trump is out there talking about free
trade.

2551
01:48:06,240 --> 01:48:11,240
We need free trade.
The Jones Act is the opposite of free 

2552
01:48:11,240 --> 01:48:11,310
trade.
It's complete protectionism.

2553
01:48:11,460 --> 01:48:14,790
It's saying that if you want to take 
something from Florida,

2554
01:48:15,390 --> 01:48:16,210
uh,
to,

2555
01:48:16,250 --> 01:48:17,460
you know,
if you want to take something,

2556
01:48:17,560 --> 01:48:22,560
no,
if you want to take something a between 

2557
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:23,700
the US and Puerto Rico,
you've got to use a US ship.

2558
01:48:23,701 --> 01:48:25,110
You can't use a foreign ship,
right?

2559
01:48:25,111 --> 01:48:30,111
So there's no competition.
But what this has done is this has 

2560
01:48:30,111 --> 01:48:30,900
dramatically increased the cost of 
living.

2561
01:48:30,901 --> 01:48:35,901
So even though the average person in 
Puerto Rico earns half of what the 

2562
01:48:35,901 --> 01:48:39,351
average person in Kentucky earns,
groceries in Puerto Rico are more 

2563
01:48:39,351 --> 01:48:39,420
expensive than groceries in Kentucky.

2564
01:48:39,990 --> 01:48:44,990
So you have lower income but a higher 
cost of living that's thanks to the 

2565
01:48:44,990 --> 01:48:47,100
Jones Act.
And if they repealed the Jones Act,

2566
01:48:47,220 --> 01:48:49,080
the cost of living in Puerto Rico and 
punch.

2567
01:48:49,081 --> 01:48:51,420
And that's one of the reasons too that 
the tourism industry,

2568
01:48:51,630 --> 01:48:53,850
Puerto Rico is a beautiful island.
I mean,

2569
01:48:53,851 --> 01:48:55,800
if you haven't been there,
you should come.

2570
01:48:55,830 --> 01:48:57,150
It's a,
it's a magnificent island.

2571
01:48:57,240 --> 01:49:00,780
And what's also great about it is it has
a real culture as a real vibe to it.

2572
01:49:00,781 --> 01:49:01,830
It's a,
it's a city.

2573
01:49:01,831 --> 01:49:04,620
It's like it's a Latin American city on 
an island.

2574
01:49:04,920 --> 01:49:06,630
It's not just like a remote little 
island,

2575
01:49:06,631 --> 01:49:09,930
so it's a really nice place to be and 
it's one of the only places that I think

2576
01:49:09,931 --> 01:49:12,010
you can really live in the Caribbean 
and,

2577
01:49:12,070 --> 01:49:13,590
and not feel like you're just,
you know,

2578
01:49:13,940 --> 01:49:15,660
on Gilligan's island or not,
but just,

2579
01:49:15,661 --> 01:49:17,250
you know,
like on vacation all the time.

2580
01:49:17,400 --> 01:49:20,010
It's a real city with real stuff going 
on.

2581
01:49:20,340 --> 01:49:22,140
And I've been there now long enough 
that,

2582
01:49:22,600 --> 01:49:23,340
you know,
you know,

2583
01:49:23,430 --> 01:49:24,630
I would go there.
You know,

2584
01:49:24,631 --> 01:49:27,210
you even without the tax breaks,
I like being there.

2585
01:49:27,270 --> 01:49:32,270
Right.
I look forward to going about crime and 

2586
01:49:32,270 --> 01:49:34,821
poverty and there's crime there in the 
big city in San Juan and certain areas 

2587
01:49:34,821 --> 01:49:37,920
just like there are in New York and just
like all major US cities.

2588
01:49:37,921 --> 01:49:40,500
You've got crime problems and again,
that's there.

2589
01:49:40,620 --> 01:49:42,870
There's,
there's a lot of reasons for that.

2590
01:49:42,871 --> 01:49:44,430
Again,
it has to do with government,

2591
01:49:44,431 --> 01:49:46,680
it has to do with the drug laws and all 
the other things.

2592
01:49:46,681 --> 01:49:48,370
Although they medical marijuana

2593
01:49:48,940 --> 01:49:50,200
in,
in Puerto Rico,

2594
01:49:50,201 --> 01:49:52,240
I think eventually they'll probably have
recreational,

2595
01:49:52,241 --> 01:49:54,400
but at least they have a,
they have medical.

2596
01:49:54,970 --> 01:49:56,470
But um,
what was I,

2597
01:49:56,530 --> 01:49:58,150
what was,
I just lost my train of thought.

2598
01:49:58,480 --> 01:50:00,790
What was I,
what we're talking about.

2599
01:50:00,850 --> 01:50:02,120
Oh,
the Jones Act Jones Act,

2600
01:50:02,500 --> 01:50:03,640
right.
And so.

2601
01:50:03,641 --> 01:50:05,560
Oh yeah.
So how it hurts the tourism industry.

2602
01:50:05,561 --> 01:50:10,120
So the Jones Act makes a Puerto Rican 
hotels,

2603
01:50:10,530 --> 01:50:11,400
uh,
you know,

2604
01:50:11,800 --> 01:50:16,800
unable to compete on the low end with 
hotels and other Caribbean islands 

2605
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:21,150
because everything is so expensive 
because of the Jones Act and because 

2606
01:50:21,150 --> 01:50:22,660
they have the US minimum wage 
specifically is the Jones Act.

2607
01:50:22,840 --> 01:50:23,460
How does it,
what does it,

2608
01:50:23,550 --> 01:50:25,900
it's on the shipping imports,
right.

2609
01:50:25,901 --> 01:50:28,450
So all the food in Puerto Rico is more 
expensive.

2610
01:50:28,600 --> 01:50:31,360
All the supply.
So hotels have a lot of things.

2611
01:50:31,361 --> 01:50:33,990
Were you going to a hotel?
There's all kinds of products.

2612
01:50:33,991 --> 01:50:37,810
You got bath products in there has to be
shipped and all the food that you eat,

2613
01:50:37,811 --> 01:50:39,610
all the drinks,
all this stuff is shipped in.

2614
01:50:39,820 --> 01:50:44,820
And to bring it to Puerto Rico is a lot 
more expensive than the bring it to the 

2615
01:50:44,820 --> 01:50:47,950
Bahamas or bring it to Barbados or 
someplace else.

2616
01:50:47,951 --> 01:50:52,951
So all these other Caribbean islands can
get a lot of American tourists to go 

2617
01:50:52,951 --> 01:50:54,580
there.
On for bargain vacations,

2618
01:50:54,730 --> 01:50:57,160
but Puerto Rico can't compete on the low
end,

2619
01:50:57,370 --> 01:50:58,610
on the real high end.
Oh,

2620
01:50:58,660 --> 01:51:02,440
they can compete because their people 
are not as concerned about the cost.

2621
01:51:02,680 --> 01:51:04,840
But on the lower end,
the budget traveler,

2622
01:51:05,170 --> 01:51:10,170
a lot more people would be going to 
Puerto Rico if it wasn't for the Jones 

2623
01:51:10,170 --> 01:51:12,730
Act because they're,
the hotels would be able to cater to,

2624
01:51:12,990 --> 01:51:17,990
you know,
a lower price point because they could 

2625
01:51:17,990 --> 01:51:17,990
hire the chamber maid for less money.
They could,

2626
01:51:17,990 --> 01:51:19,800
they could,
they could have lower prices at,

2627
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:23,920
at the restaurant.
So this is really destroying the tourism

2628
01:51:23,921 --> 01:51:26,620
industry in,
in Puerto Rico,

2629
01:51:26,621 --> 01:51:28,570
which could be thriving,
uh,

2630
01:51:28,571 --> 01:51:33,571
but for the Jones Act,
but also it is diminishing the standard 

2631
01:51:33,571 --> 01:51:36,020
of living of Puerto Rican who are forced
to pay higher prices.

2632
01:51:36,020 --> 01:51:36,350
I mean,
what's,

2633
01:51:36,370 --> 01:51:41,370
what happens is,
let's say there's a big ship coming in 

2634
01:51:41,370 --> 01:51:43,060
from China with all sorts of goods and 
it's gonna.

2635
01:51:43,061 --> 01:51:43,400
It's,
it's,

2636
01:51:43,570 --> 01:51:48,370
it's headed for a US port.
If it could stop off at Puerto Rico,

2637
01:51:48,490 --> 01:51:51,310
drop a few things off and then continue 
on,

2638
01:51:51,660 --> 01:51:52,960
you know,
its destination.

2639
01:51:53,290 --> 01:51:55,700
That would be great.
It would be inexpensive for,

2640
01:51:55,740 --> 01:51:58,030
they can't.
What it has to do is it has to bring all

2641
01:51:58,031 --> 01:52:03,031
this stuff that's going to Puerto Rico 
to the u s unloaded and then load it 

2642
01:52:03,031 --> 01:52:05,500
back on a US flag ship and then send it 
back to Puerto Rico,

2643
01:52:05,890 --> 01:52:10,890
which costs a fortune.
And then the same thing with Puerto 

2644
01:52:10,890 --> 01:52:10,890
Rican exports.
So their whole.

2645
01:52:10,890 --> 01:52:15,750
The whole Puerto Rican international 
commerce is being limited by the Jones 

2646
01:52:16,990 --> 01:52:18,490
Act.
Now this also affects Hawaii.

2647
01:52:18,610 --> 01:52:23,610
Hawaii suffers from the Jones Act two,
but Hawaii is much richer than Puerto 

2648
01:52:23,610 --> 01:52:27,840
Rico.
They have a much higher average income 

2649
01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:27,840
and so even though it,
you know,

2650
01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:29,140
it affects them,
it's not as.

2651
01:52:29,170 --> 01:52:34,170
It's not as big a deal.
It's the same thing with Hawaii even 

2652
01:52:34,170 --> 01:52:34,170
though Hawaii is a state.
Yeah.

2653
01:52:34,170 --> 01:52:35,920
Because yeah,
because Hawaii is a US port,

2654
01:52:36,100 --> 01:52:41,100
so you know,
Hawaii has to have all these Jones act 

2655
01:52:41,100 --> 01:52:41,530
ships as well,
but so the.

2656
01:52:41,540 --> 01:52:46,540
If something gets delivered to Hawaii,
it has to get delivered to somewhere 

2657
01:52:46,540 --> 01:52:46,540
first and then shipped

2658
01:52:46,540 --> 01:52:48,620
to Hawaii to go to California.
For us,

2659
01:52:48,650 --> 01:52:51,920
most stuff that's going to Hawaii,
this coming from the Pacific,

2660
01:52:52,610 --> 01:52:54,440
they don't stop off at Hawaii.
They made.

2661
01:52:54,520 --> 01:52:58,160
Seems so crazy of Hawaii is actually a 
state like Puerto Rican.

2662
01:52:58,280 --> 01:53:00,020
No,
because that was a strange thing.

2663
01:53:00,021 --> 01:53:01,370
It's right.
It's a territory,

2664
01:53:01,380 --> 01:53:01,710
right?

2665
01:53:01,950 --> 01:53:03,880
That's.
That's the best thing that Puerto Rico's

2666
01:53:03,900 --> 01:53:05,970
got going for it.
If it was a state,

2667
01:53:06,060 --> 01:53:09,360
they'd have to pay the state income tax.
They'd have to pay the obamacare tax,

2668
01:53:09,510 --> 01:53:12,840
they'd have to pay the federal gas tax.
They're exempt from all that stuff,

2669
01:53:13,080 --> 01:53:18,080
but the Jones Act has to do with.
You can't take a ship between two US 

2670
01:53:18,641 --> 01:53:19,560
ports.
They have.

2671
01:53:19,580 --> 01:53:21,630
It has to be a foreign port to a US 
port,

2672
01:53:21,870 --> 01:53:24,480
so Puerto Rico is not considered a 
foreign port.

2673
01:53:24,930 --> 01:53:29,930
It's a domestic port.
Hawaii of course is the mess they pick 

2674
01:53:29,930 --> 01:53:32,791
us for.
Why is the state and so Hawaii things 

2675
01:53:32,791 --> 01:53:35,991
are very expensive in Hawaii for the 
same reason that they're expensive in 

2676
01:53:35,991 --> 01:53:37,560
Puerto Rico,
but Hawaiians can afford it more because

2677
01:53:37,561 --> 01:53:42,561
Hawaiians on average have more money and
so if your average income is higher than

2678
01:53:43,040 --> 01:53:43,590
you know,
your,

2679
01:53:43,610 --> 01:53:48,610
you know,
your food budget is not as important to 

2680
01:53:48,610 --> 01:53:48,610
you.

2681
01:53:48,610 --> 01:53:51,050
So if we got rid of the Jones Act,
that would be a big benefit for Puerto 

2682
01:53:51,050 --> 01:53:51,050
Rico.
But you know,

2683
01:53:51,050 --> 01:53:55,161
the worst thing that can happen to 
Puerto Rico is it becomes a state and I 

2684
01:53:55,161 --> 01:53:58,371
get tired of it.
I keep hearing these politicians say 

2685
01:53:58,371 --> 01:54:00,210
Puerto Rico needs to be a state and all 
the problems will be solved.

2686
01:54:00,630 --> 01:54:05,630
Their problems will go through the roof.
The only thing that will happen if 

2687
01:54:05,630 --> 01:54:08,700
Puerto Rico becomes a state is the 
welfare checks will get bigger to people

2688
01:54:08,701 --> 01:54:13,701
in Puerto Rico,
but that's the last thing they need is 

2689
01:54:13,701 --> 01:54:13,701
more welfare.
They need more freedom.

2690
01:54:13,701 --> 01:54:18,501
They need more opportunity.
They need more free enterprise and all 

2691
01:54:18,501 --> 01:54:18,960
that will go away if they become a 
state.

2692
01:54:19,080 --> 01:54:24,080
Because if you imagine all the problems 
a Puerto Rican has now imagine leveling 

2693
01:54:24,080 --> 01:54:27,570
the income tax on top of that.
Imagine sending the irs to Puerto Rico.

2694
01:54:27,600 --> 01:54:28,860
They've mapped their,
not even down there.

2695
01:54:28,861 --> 01:54:30,470
Now imagine have an irs agent

2696
01:54:30,690 --> 01:54:35,690
with this real support for socialism.
Is there any place where socialism has 

2697
01:54:35,690 --> 01:54:40,191
worked where there's like some extreme 
benefits to the people that lived there 

2698
01:54:40,191 --> 01:54:41,850
where they can show you?
Because there are guys like you,

2699
01:54:41,851 --> 01:54:44,310
the free market capitalist guys.
You're always saying like,

2700
01:54:44,490 --> 01:54:46,320
this is,
this is the solution.

2701
01:54:46,620 --> 01:54:48,510
You know,
capitalism is solution.

2702
01:54:48,511 --> 01:54:51,030
Give people freedom.
Solution deregulation.

2703
01:54:51,180 --> 01:54:53,640
That's the solution.
Let businesses thrive.

2704
01:54:53,670 --> 01:54:56,400
More people to make money.
Businesses will grow.

2705
01:54:56,430 --> 01:54:57,950
People have more opportunity.
Yeah.

2706
01:54:57,950 --> 01:55:00,500
You know,
people think it's worked in Scandinavia.

2707
01:55:00,501 --> 01:55:03,140
You know,
they always want to talk about Sweden as

2708
01:55:03,141 --> 01:55:05,780
an example of where socialism works 
well,

2709
01:55:05,781 --> 01:55:07,190
poc to a suite,
right?

2710
01:55:07,310 --> 01:55:09,020
And they'll tell you that it doesn't 
work,

2711
01:55:09,021 --> 01:55:11,600
but if you want to look at the history 
of Swedish socialism,

2712
01:55:11,870 --> 01:55:16,870
Sweden became a very wealthy country 
before they had that socialism,

2713
01:55:17,541 --> 01:55:22,541
right?
They were very much of a free market 

2714
01:55:22,541 --> 01:55:23,180
economy and it was the freedom that 
produced all the wealth,

2715
01:55:23,360 --> 01:55:25,610
but then whenever you have wealth and 
you have freedom,

2716
01:55:25,611 --> 01:55:27,260
you're always going to have any quality,
right?

2717
01:55:27,261 --> 01:55:29,660
Because people are smarter than other 
people,

2718
01:55:29,661 --> 01:55:31,250
more ambitious,
harder working.

2719
01:55:31,430 --> 01:55:36,430
So whenever you have freedom,
you're not going to have equality and 

2720
01:55:36,430 --> 01:55:40,061
outcome.
Even if everybody has an equal 

2721
01:55:40,061 --> 01:55:40,370
opportunity.
And of course even that's not true,

2722
01:55:40,371 --> 01:55:41,400
equal opposite.
Every.

2723
01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:43,980
Everybody is equal in the eyes of the,
but there's always going to be

2724
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:45,990
some people that will have an advantage.
You know,

2725
01:55:45,991 --> 01:55:49,730
maybe they have better connections.
They were born to parents that are,

2726
01:55:49,770 --> 01:55:51,450
you know,
have more money and they can give them,

2727
01:55:51,540 --> 01:55:52,860
you know,
give them a leg up.

2728
01:55:53,400 --> 01:55:56,070
So you're always gonna have unequal 
outcomes.

2729
01:55:56,071 --> 01:55:58,410
Some people are going to be rich 
relative to other people,

2730
01:55:58,411 --> 01:56:03,411
but the beauty of,
of capitalism is that everybody is 

2731
01:56:03,411 --> 01:56:04,650
better off.
When you end up with socialism,

2732
01:56:04,780 --> 01:56:06,450
you,
you equalize everybody,

2733
01:56:06,451 --> 01:56:09,570
but you equalize them at a lower level.
You redistribute the poverty,

2734
01:56:09,690 --> 01:56:13,140
the people who end up wealthy or the 
people who have political connections.

2735
01:56:13,141 --> 01:56:15,700
So the wealthy people in socialist 
countries are,

2736
01:56:15,790 --> 01:56:20,790
are,
are the people who have political 

2737
01:56:20,790 --> 01:56:20,790
connections.
What happened with Sweden?

2738
01:56:20,790 --> 01:56:20,790
So let me go up.
Yeah,

2739
01:56:20,790 --> 01:56:24,501
I'm going to go back to Sweden.
So Sweden was very rich and then of 

2740
01:56:24,501 --> 01:56:27,561
course you have the demographics to 
politicians who will get votes by 

2741
01:56:27,561 --> 01:56:28,590
appealing to envy.

2742
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:30,780
Hey,
this guy has more than you.

2743
01:56:31,140 --> 01:56:33,540
It's not fair.
And of course,

2744
01:56:33,541 --> 01:56:36,000
politicians always promised something 
for nothing,

2745
01:56:36,120 --> 01:56:41,120
right?
Vote for me and I'll give you this that 

2746
01:56:41,120 --> 01:56:41,120
you don't have to work for,
right?

2747
01:56:41,120 --> 01:56:42,210
I mean that is the problem with a 
democracy.

2748
01:56:42,211 --> 01:56:44,010
I mean,
people vote for crazy things.

2749
01:56:44,220 --> 01:56:47,490
That's why the founding fathers,
when they created America,

2750
01:56:47,520 --> 01:56:49,320
they created a republic,
right?

2751
01:56:49,321 --> 01:56:54,321
People don't understand the distinction,
but we're not supposed to be a 

2752
01:56:54,321 --> 01:56:57,441
democracy.
The word democracy does not appear in 

2753
01:56:57,441 --> 01:56:57,700
the constitution.
It does not appear in the,

2754
01:56:57,780 --> 01:57:00,210
in the declaration of independence,
you know,

2755
01:57:00,310 --> 01:57:05,310
just read the pledge of allegiance.
I pledge allegiance to the flag of 

2756
01:57:05,310 --> 01:57:05,430
United States of America and to the 
republic,

2757
01:57:05,490 --> 01:57:06,420
right?
So we're a republic.

2758
01:57:06,421 --> 01:57:11,421
We're not a democracy because the 
founding fathers knew the dangers of 

2759
01:57:11,421 --> 01:57:11,421
democracy.
Well,

2760
01:57:11,421 --> 01:57:16,101
democracy is what brought socialism into
Sweden and it's screwed them up.

2761
01:57:16,680 --> 01:57:21,680
Right?
It screwed the economy up so much that 

2762
01:57:21,680 --> 01:57:22,680
in the last 10 years they've gone the 
other way in.

2763
01:57:22,800 --> 01:57:27,800
They've lowered income taxes.
They've abolish the inheritance tax in 

2764
01:57:27,800 --> 01:57:27,870
Sweden.
I mean,

2765
01:57:28,060 --> 01:57:29,220
you know,
when they got rid of,

2766
01:57:29,221 --> 01:57:31,350
does that sound socialists the last 10 
years?

2767
01:57:31,351 --> 01:57:33,840
So previous to that,
socialism had a stronghold.

2768
01:57:33,870 --> 01:57:34,450
Yeah,
it was.

2769
01:57:34,520 --> 01:57:36,540
Yeah.
If it was getting bigger and bigger,

2770
01:57:36,541 --> 01:57:38,310
you know,
probably going from the seventies,

2771
01:57:38,311 --> 01:57:38,870
eighties,
you know,

2772
01:57:38,920 --> 01:57:42,600
the sweetest mixed economy,
just like it bankrupted New Zealand.

2773
01:57:42,630 --> 01:57:47,630
I mean New Zealand used to be the poster
boy for mixed economy socialism until 

2774
01:57:47,630 --> 01:57:48,600
they got bankrupt.
So.

2775
01:57:48,601 --> 01:57:51,210
And then is the only successful?
No,

2776
01:57:51,300 --> 01:57:52,590
they're not sick.
Not Know,

2777
01:57:52,591 --> 01:57:57,591
but we're just going to say that that's 
the only example that someone can say 

2778
01:57:57,591 --> 01:58:00,570
they'll cite Norway,
a lot of the Scandinavian countries,

2779
01:58:00,571 --> 01:58:05,571
Denmark,
but you have to look at how successful 

2780
01:58:05,571 --> 01:58:05,850
they were before they became socialist.

2781
01:58:05,970 --> 01:58:10,970
And then you also have to look at what 
the government is doing there because 

2782
01:58:10,970 --> 01:58:14,960
the taxes on business are not extreme.
The taxes are on the average guy.

2783
01:58:16,381 --> 01:58:17,670
They have,
I think in Sweden,

2784
01:58:18,090 --> 01:58:19,170
I think the,
um,

2785
01:58:19,500 --> 01:58:22,380
the VAT is about 30 percent sales tax 
that you have to pay.

2786
01:58:22,710 --> 01:58:27,710
I mean this is a high sales tax and the 
income taxes impact average people.

2787
01:58:27,991 --> 01:58:32,991
So because they know the Swedes know,
if they really jack up taxes on 

2788
01:58:32,991 --> 01:58:37,131
businesses,
the businesses will just leave and 

2789
01:58:37,131 --> 01:58:39,771
they'll destroy their economy.
So at least they're trying to 

2790
01:58:39,771 --> 01:58:40,650
redistribute the wealth from the middle 
class to the middle class,

2791
01:58:40,651 --> 01:58:41,700
you know.
But the,

2792
01:58:41,701 --> 01:58:43,960
you know,
this stuff doesn't work and you create a

2793
01:58:43,961 --> 01:58:48,961
generations of people who now don't want
to work who just want to live off of 

2794
01:58:48,961 --> 01:58:49,900
other people.
You destroy the initiatives,

2795
01:58:49,901 --> 01:58:54,901
you destroy the incentives.
And so the success that Sweden enjoyed 

2796
01:58:54,901 --> 01:58:56,920
is a byproduct of freedom and 
capitalism.

2797
01:58:57,160 --> 01:59:01,450
And since they moved in that direction,
they have slowed down that progress.

2798
01:59:01,810 --> 01:59:06,810
But the Swedish people have recognized 
that and that's why the reforms that 

2799
01:59:06,810 --> 01:59:10,480
have been made over the last decade or 
two had been to turn back the clock,

2800
01:59:10,660 --> 01:59:15,450
to move away from those socialist 
policies and to try to dismantle.

2801
01:59:15,451 --> 01:59:17,920
And now they haven't gone completely the
other way.

2802
01:59:18,070 --> 01:59:20,680
Just like New Zealand,
I mean New Zealand went so far.

2803
01:59:20,830 --> 01:59:25,830
They became,
they went from like a totally socialist 

2804
01:59:25,830 --> 01:59:27,400
type economy one that was like,
you know,

2805
01:59:27,610 --> 01:59:30,250
this was the example,
if you believed in socialism,

2806
01:59:30,251 --> 01:59:32,820
you would point to New Zealand as see 
this shows you.

2807
01:59:32,821 --> 01:59:34,060
Right?
And then they went bankrupt.

2808
01:59:34,061 --> 01:59:38,020
They went through a huge economic crisis
in the eighties bank.

2809
01:59:38,021 --> 01:59:41,710
Previous to being socialists were the 
successful with capitalism.

2810
01:59:41,760 --> 01:59:42,550
Yeah,
of course.

2811
01:59:43,540 --> 01:59:48,540
Because if you're always socialist than 
you never have any wealth to 

2812
01:59:48,540 --> 01:59:51,991
redistribute it's capitalism that 
creates the wealth that the socialist 

2813
01:59:51,991 --> 01:59:51,991
want to redistribute.

2814
01:59:51,991 --> 01:59:54,700
So let me ask you this though,
because we're going to keep going around

2815
01:59:54,790 --> 01:59:58,720
in circles with this year ago,
studied this for a long period of time.

2816
01:59:59,200 --> 02:00:02,830
What is it about socialism that's so 
appealing to p two people?

2817
02:00:02,831 --> 02:00:05,350
If there's no examples of it being 
effective?

2818
02:00:05,620 --> 02:00:06,250
Well,
you know,

2819
02:00:06,251 --> 02:00:08,140
as I keep coming up,
well again,

2820
02:00:08,200 --> 02:00:11,920
when is it a lack of education or lack 
of understanding of economics?

2821
02:00:12,070 --> 02:00:17,070
Like what is it about it that keeps like
when this woman who just won and she 

2822
02:00:17,070 --> 02:00:21,150
seems like a very nice person when she 
talks about being a democratic socialist

2823
02:00:21,151 --> 02:00:24,140
and nobody gets fired up.
And is it ignorance like.

2824
02:00:24,470 --> 02:00:25,030
Yeah,
look,

2825
02:00:25,031 --> 02:00:30,031
it certainly,
it's a lack of understanding of 

2826
02:00:30,031 --> 02:00:30,280
economics.
Most people don't understand it,

2827
02:00:30,281 --> 02:00:35,281
but look,
I mean there are a lot of reasons that 

2828
02:00:35,281 --> 02:00:36,430
socialism is appealing to people,
especially when they're young,

2829
02:00:36,490 --> 02:00:38,980
right?
There's an old saying that if you're not

2830
02:00:39,190 --> 02:00:43,360
a socialist or if you're not a liberal 
by the time you're 21,

2831
02:00:43,361 --> 02:00:44,110
you don't have a heart.

2832
02:00:44,380 --> 02:00:46,570
If you're not a conservative,
by the time you're 28,

2833
02:00:46,571 --> 02:00:47,680
you don't have a headache.
Right?

2834
02:00:47,681 --> 02:00:50,680
So liberals are just people that never 
grew up.

2835
02:00:50,740 --> 02:00:51,190
Right?
It's like,

2836
02:00:51,191 --> 02:00:51,960
it's like,
it's like,

2837
02:00:52,330 --> 02:00:54,190
it's like they still believe in Santa 
Claus.

2838
02:00:54,340 --> 02:00:55,390
That's what it is.
You,

2839
02:00:55,450 --> 02:01:00,450
you just never socialists and 
particularly not necessarily liberal 

2840
02:01:00,450 --> 02:01:00,450
even.
Well,

2841
02:01:00,450 --> 02:01:02,290
even people believing in big garbage 
because usually what happens is,

2842
02:01:02,430 --> 02:01:03,880
you know when you're a kid,
right?

2843
02:01:03,881 --> 02:01:08,881
And when you're in high school,
you've never had a job and all this 

2844
02:01:08,881 --> 02:01:10,420
stuff sounds great until you're out in 
the real world paying taxes,

2845
02:01:10,600 --> 02:01:12,550
you know,
that's why it was a mistake to lower the

2846
02:01:12,551 --> 02:01:16,210
voting age down to 18.
I mean I don't even think 21.

2847
02:01:16,570 --> 02:01:21,570
It should be higher.
If you think about the original voting 

2848
02:01:21,570 --> 02:01:22,780
age when it was 21 100 years ago,
150 years ago,

2849
02:01:23,110 --> 02:01:28,110
think about a guy who was 21 back in 18.
50 different person.

2850
02:01:28,420 --> 02:01:33,420
I think about.
I mean the guy probably got out of 

2851
02:01:33,420 --> 02:01:33,420
school when he was 10.
He probably already has been working.

2852
02:01:33,420 --> 02:01:35,590
He has got a family.
He's in the real world and I know people

2853
02:01:35,591 --> 02:01:36,220
are gonna say,
look,

2854
02:01:36,221 --> 02:01:37,660
women were in voting fine,
you know,

2855
02:01:37,661 --> 02:01:38,300
whatever.
Like I,

2856
02:01:38,301 --> 02:01:39,230
I'm,
I don't think that.

2857
02:01:39,231 --> 02:01:41,900
How old do you think it should be?
I think maybe 28,

2858
02:01:41,901 --> 02:01:42,350
30.

2859
02:01:44,510 --> 02:01:47,420
Look,
look,

2860
02:01:48,440 --> 02:01:52,520
let me make it fit.
But that's the reason.

2861
02:01:52,730 --> 02:01:57,730
The reason they re,
it's all the reasons would be 28 years 

2862
02:01:57,730 --> 02:01:58,250
old enough sun.
You know,

2863
02:01:58,310 --> 02:02:03,310
the reason,
the reason they raised the voting age 

2864
02:02:03,310 --> 02:02:03,310
was because of Vietnam,
because of the draft,

2865
02:02:03,310 --> 02:02:04,580
right?
They were saying old enough to fight old

2866
02:02:04,581 --> 02:02:09,581
enough to vote,
which was a bunch of lower the voting 

2867
02:02:09,581 --> 02:02:09,581
age.
No,

2868
02:02:09,581 --> 02:02:09,581
no,
they.

2869
02:02:09,581 --> 02:02:09,770
They lowered it,
right.

2870
02:02:09,771 --> 02:02:12,590
Because he used to get drafted when you 
were 18 and they were saying,

2871
02:02:12,591 --> 02:02:13,160
look,
you know,

2872
02:02:13,520 --> 02:02:14,720
I,
if you're going to drop and look,

2873
02:02:14,721 --> 02:02:19,721
I don't believe in the draft.
I would rather get rid of the draft and 

2874
02:02:19,721 --> 02:02:21,140
leave it with you.
That 21 sounds better.

2875
02:02:21,141 --> 02:02:24,860
I would say 25 because that's the age to
your frontal cortex develops,

2876
02:02:25,010 --> 02:02:25,500
but no.
What?

2877
02:02:25,501 --> 02:02:25,800
Ah,
what's,

2878
02:02:25,860 --> 02:02:28,070
what's important about voting is not 
voting.

2879
02:02:28,100 --> 02:02:29,810
Look,
when I moved to Puerto Rico,

2880
02:02:29,811 --> 02:02:31,280
I,
I gave up my right to vote.

2881
02:02:31,280 --> 02:02:36,280
Right.
That's one of the things I can don't 

2882
02:02:36,280 --> 02:02:36,280
vote at all for president,
for anything.

2883
02:02:36,280 --> 02:02:36,280
No.
I can't vote for congressmen.

2884
02:02:36,280 --> 02:02:40,900
They don't have a congress.
There is nobody that is still a state 

2885
02:02:40,900 --> 02:02:41,690
territory territory.
But.

2886
02:02:41,830 --> 02:02:46,830
So if you live in Puerto Rico and you 
move to Florida now you can vote for 

2887
02:02:46,830 --> 02:02:48,560
congressmen in your district.
You can vote for a Florida senator.

2888
02:02:48,561 --> 02:02:53,330
How much time to spend in Florida to be 
officially living there?

2889
02:02:53,360 --> 02:02:53,990
Well,
I mean,

2890
02:02:54,320 --> 02:02:57,560
if you kept your place in Puerto Rico,
well I wouldn't want to do that.

2891
02:02:57,590 --> 02:02:58,640
But you know,
if you're,

2892
02:02:58,641 --> 02:03:01,070
if you're important,
if you're in 100,

2893
02:03:01,071 --> 02:03:04,940
83 days is the cutoff for where your 
residence is going to be.

2894
02:03:05,360 --> 02:03:09,560
But the important thing about voting is 
not that you get to vote.

2895
02:03:10,070 --> 02:03:12,410
The important thing is to have good 
government,

2896
02:03:12,500 --> 02:03:13,670
right?
And what is good government?

2897
02:03:13,671 --> 02:03:18,671
Good government is government that 
respects a private property that 

2898
02:03:18,671 --> 02:03:18,671
respects that,
you know,

2899
02:03:18,671 --> 02:03:19,560
if you go back and look at.

2900
02:03:19,560 --> 02:03:21,920
I mentioned this on one of my own 
podcast recently,

2901
02:03:22,100 --> 02:03:25,580
I talked about the meaning of America 
and what government is for in America.

2902
02:03:25,581 --> 02:03:30,581
American.
If you go back to the declaration of 

2903
02:03:30,581 --> 02:03:30,581
independence,
we just had,

2904
02:03:30,581 --> 02:03:30,581
we celebrated our independence day,
you know,

2905
02:03:30,581 --> 02:03:32,630
just a couple of weeks ago.
Um,

2906
02:03:32,870 --> 02:03:36,290
but government is here to protect life,
liberty,

2907
02:03:36,291 --> 02:03:41,291
and the pursuit of happiness.
Their government is here to protect our 

2908
02:03:41,291 --> 02:03:41,300
rights.
It's not here to give us free stuff.

2909
02:03:41,450 --> 02:03:44,000
It's not here to take stuff from other 
people and give it to us.

2910
02:03:44,210 --> 02:03:46,310
It's there to protect us,
right?

2911
02:03:46,311 --> 02:03:47,960
It's there protecting life,
liberty,

2912
02:03:47,961 --> 02:03:52,961
property.
And so the goal of government or the 

2913
02:03:52,961 --> 02:03:53,000
goal of an election is to have good 
government.

2914
02:03:53,240 --> 02:03:54,590
Now,
as far as I'm concerned,

2915
02:03:55,010 --> 02:04:00,010
I would rather have good government 
where I don't vote then bad government 

2916
02:04:00,010 --> 02:04:00,010
where I do vote,
right?

2917
02:04:00,010 --> 02:04:01,430
Because you know,
one of the things that people said,

2918
02:04:01,431 --> 02:04:02,930
oh,
you're going to move to Puerto Rico.

2919
02:04:02,930 --> 02:04:04,460
You can't vote.
Who Cares?

2920
02:04:04,461 --> 02:04:09,461
I voted for the loser in every election.
What difference does it make when some 

2921
02:04:09,461 --> 02:04:10,630
idiots are going to outvote me?
And,

2922
02:04:10,631 --> 02:04:15,631
and,
and that's basically who's voting in 

2923
02:04:15,631 --> 02:04:15,631
America.
I mean,

2924
02:04:15,631 --> 02:04:18,070
if you think about it,
the elections are decided by the TV 

2925
02:04:18,070 --> 02:04:18,620
commercials,
right?

2926
02:04:18,621 --> 02:04:19,940
Because most people,
you know,

2927
02:04:19,941 --> 02:04:23,030
they know who they're gonna vote for.
Can you imagine the person who's,

2928
02:04:23,210 --> 02:04:25,850
who decides who's going to vote for 
based on a TV commercial?

2929
02:04:25,910 --> 02:04:27,830
I mean,
these guys are more on the swing.

2930
02:04:28,070 --> 02:04:31,340
The swing voters are determining the 
outcome of these elections.

2931
02:04:31,610 --> 02:04:33,440
And we ended up with horrible 
government.

2932
02:04:33,441 --> 02:04:38,441
I mean,
government democracy almost guarantees 

2933
02:04:38,441 --> 02:04:40,960
horrible government,
but what are the things you want to do 

2934
02:04:40,960 --> 02:04:40,960
if you're going to have democracy is 
okay,

2935
02:04:40,960 --> 02:04:44,640
let's have responsible people voting who
understand what they're voting for,

2936
02:04:44,641 --> 02:04:47,070
who have actually lived and worked in 
the economy,

2937
02:04:47,071 --> 02:04:49,620
who have had a job,
who have paid taxes,

2938
02:04:49,680 --> 02:04:52,230
who have run businesses,
who have employed people.

2939
02:04:52,290 --> 02:04:57,290
If you've never had a job,
if you're still living with your 

2940
02:04:57,290 --> 02:04:57,290
parents,
why are you voting?

2941
02:04:57,290 --> 02:05:01,341
I mean,
we might as well lower the voting age 

2942
02:05:01,341 --> 02:05:01,341
and let people in kindergarten vote.
I mean,

2943
02:05:01,341 --> 02:05:04,850
right?
So they can vote for whoever promises 

2944
02:05:04,850 --> 02:05:06,831
them free toys and people so you don't.
Oh,

2945
02:05:07,111 --> 02:05:08,340
it's unfair.
Look,

2946
02:05:08,400 --> 02:05:11,850
if we could have good government without
18 year olds voting,

2947
02:05:11,970 --> 02:05:13,260
that's fine.
You know,

2948
02:05:13,261 --> 02:05:18,261
but the left wants the young people 
voting because they're stupid enough to 

2949
02:05:18,261 --> 02:05:18,390
vote for their.
Yeah.

2950
02:05:18,391 --> 02:05:23,391
And you said,
why is socialism appealing to somebody 

2951
02:05:23,391 --> 02:05:23,391
who's young?
Because they don't know any better.

2952
02:05:23,391 --> 02:05:26,690
They haven't lived and it sounds good,
right?

2953
02:05:26,910 --> 02:05:27,600
Oh,
you know,

2954
02:05:27,690 --> 02:05:32,690
I care about people.
That's why liberals think conservatives 

2955
02:05:33,180 --> 02:05:34,570
are mean,
right?

2956
02:05:34,630 --> 02:05:39,630
Right.
Conservatives don't think liberals are 

2957
02:05:39,630 --> 02:05:39,630
me.
They just think they don't understand.

2958
02:05:39,630 --> 02:05:40,620
They're misinformed,
right?

2959
02:05:40,700 --> 02:05:41,080
They're,
they're,

2960
02:05:41,081 --> 02:05:41,820
they're,
they don't.

2961
02:05:41,821 --> 02:05:42,570
They don't get it.

2962
02:05:42,630 --> 02:05:44,610
Right.
That's sort of shifting.

2963
02:05:44,880 --> 02:05:49,880
It seems like there's more people that 
are thinking that liberals are mean now 

2964
02:05:49,880 --> 02:05:51,510
than ever before because of the way 
they're attacking thing.

2965
02:05:51,511 --> 02:05:53,430
Yeah,
because liberals are now so intolerant,

2966
02:05:53,431 --> 02:05:55,630
which is the craziest part.
Like they like to pretend that there are

2967
02:05:55,631 --> 02:06:00,631
so tolerant,
but they're the most intolerant people 

2968
02:06:00,631 --> 02:06:00,740
out there.
Only tolerant if you agree with yes.

2969
02:06:00,840 --> 02:06:05,280
And to be tolerant,
you have to tolerate intolerance.

2970
02:06:05,520 --> 02:06:06,460
Right?
That see,

2971
02:06:06,700 --> 02:06:08,370
when we talked earlier about 
discrimination,

2972
02:06:08,371 --> 02:06:10,560
look,
if somebody is a racist,

2973
02:06:10,650 --> 02:06:12,450
I'm going to tolerate that.
Fine.

2974
02:06:12,480 --> 02:06:15,240
You can have your own opinion.
I can disagree with your opinion,

2975
02:06:15,360 --> 02:06:16,800
but fine.
Live and let live.

2976
02:06:16,801 --> 02:06:19,500
I live in a free country.
People can do things I don't like,

2977
02:06:19,630 --> 02:06:21,270
but to a liberal,
if you don't,

2978
02:06:21,271 --> 02:06:23,400
if you don't think exactly the way they 
think,

2979
02:06:23,700 --> 02:06:24,480
then,
oh they,

2980
02:06:24,540 --> 02:06:25,150
oh yeah,
they're,

2981
02:06:25,390 --> 02:06:26,430
you know,
harass you.

2982
02:06:26,580 --> 02:06:31,580
So they're becoming evil and mean.
So they used to just be ignorant now.

2983
02:06:31,771 --> 02:06:32,470
Now,
now they're.

2984
02:06:32,550 --> 02:06:34,950
Now they're ignorant at admin.
Well,

2985
02:06:34,951 --> 02:06:37,170
not just mean,
but harassing people,

2986
02:06:37,171 --> 02:06:42,171
encouraging people to harass people that
have separate political views and 

2987
02:06:42,171 --> 02:06:42,190
opinion.
Yes,

2988
02:06:42,191 --> 02:06:42,550
it's,
it's,

2989
02:06:42,600 --> 02:06:44,730
it's very,
it's very strangely.

2990
02:06:44,731 --> 02:06:49,731
Anybody who supports the trump 
administration or is even a part of it 

2991
02:06:49,930 --> 02:06:52,520
is people to get harassed at restaurants
and.

2992
02:06:52,830 --> 02:06:53,430
Yeah,
and you know,

2993
02:06:53,431 --> 02:06:55,860
I wish I could be a bigger supporter of 
trump.

2994
02:06:55,861 --> 02:06:57,080
I mean I voted for him.
I,

2995
02:06:57,081 --> 02:07:02,081
I really liked trump as a candidate a 
because he was saying a lot of the same 

2996
02:07:02,081 --> 02:07:02,820
things I was saying when he was a 
candidate.

2997
02:07:02,940 --> 02:07:07,940
It's just at the minute he said,
well about the phony economy and you 

2998
02:07:07,940 --> 02:07:07,950
know,
how we have to,

2999
02:07:08,100 --> 02:07:10,740
you know,
the numbers are not right and we have to

3000
02:07:10,741 --> 02:07:15,741
shrink government.
So from you economically it made more 

3001
02:07:15,741 --> 02:07:15,741
sense than Hillary.

3002
02:07:15,741 --> 02:07:20,080
Well,
I mean Hillary would be certainly a 

3003
02:07:20,080 --> 02:07:22,581
disaster,
but the irony of it is why would she be 

3004
02:07:22,581 --> 02:07:22,581
a disaster because she was just,
you no more big government.

3005
02:07:22,581 --> 02:07:23,010
I mean,
you know,

3006
02:07:23,011 --> 02:07:25,770
and I think she would have continued the
failed policies,

3007
02:07:25,980 --> 02:07:30,980
but unfortunately trump has continued 
those policies as well and he could end 

3008
02:07:30,980 --> 02:07:35,330
up being a bigger disaster if he is the 
catalyst to put a Bernie Sanders type 

3009
02:07:35,330 --> 02:07:40,290
into the White House in response in 
response to how much worse the economy 

3010
02:07:40,691 --> 02:07:43,760
gets and he takes the blame for it.
But do you.

3011
02:07:43,780 --> 02:07:47,560
So this is all predicated on your 
initial view that the economy's going to

3012
02:07:47,561 --> 02:07:50,300
crash inside the next three years.
If it doesn't it,

3013
02:07:50,301 --> 02:07:51,640
it does really well.
Well,

3014
02:07:51,641 --> 02:07:53,590
it stays in this state that it's,
it's.

3015
02:07:53,790 --> 02:07:56,560
Is it doing that well now it's just a 
bubble.

3016
02:07:56,620 --> 02:07:57,090
It's,
I mean it's,

3017
02:07:57,120 --> 02:07:57,720
it's,
it's,

3018
02:07:57,860 --> 02:08:01,000
it's no different than it was when Obama
was president.

3019
02:08:01,390 --> 02:08:03,760
There's just some more optimism that 
things are going to change.

3020
02:08:03,761 --> 02:08:08,761
But when you were talking about this 
before it happened and I remember you 

3021
02:08:08,761 --> 02:08:10,300
going on these different talk shows 
saying this is going to crash and people

3022
02:08:10,301 --> 02:08:11,710
weren't listening to you and they were 
like,

3023
02:08:11,711 --> 02:08:16,711
oh,
Peter Shifts does nobody's talking 

3024
02:08:16,711 --> 02:08:16,711
about.
And then it did crash and then they,

3025
02:08:16,711 --> 02:08:21,420
they listened to you.
You're the only one that's saying it's 

3026
02:08:21,420 --> 02:08:21,420
going to crash again.
Well,

3027
02:08:21,420 --> 02:08:22,330
they never really listened to me.
They kind of tolerated me.

3028
02:08:22,331 --> 02:08:23,500
Here's the deal.
They had to.

3029
02:08:23,510 --> 02:08:28,510
Because you are right.
Well here's the irony of it all because 

3030
02:08:28,510 --> 02:08:32,130
you know,
leading up to the 2008 financial crisis 

3031
02:08:32,130 --> 02:08:34,000
and if you go to my youtube channel,
you could see like my introductory video

3032
02:08:34,270 --> 02:08:39,040
is a little montage that I actually shot
as part of my senate campaign when I ran

3033
02:08:39,041 --> 02:08:40,850
for Senate in 2010,
but it's a,

3034
02:08:40,870 --> 02:08:45,870
a bunch of people you know,
mocking me and then a lot of the shows 

3035
02:08:45,870 --> 02:08:46,210
that I went on where they said,
hey,

3036
02:08:46,211 --> 02:08:46,750
you were right.

3037
02:08:46,750 --> 02:08:48,040
You know where the one guy that called 
it.

3038
02:08:48,280 --> 02:08:52,030
So I used to be on,
I was on television a lot on Fox,

3039
02:08:52,031 --> 02:08:53,530
CNBC,
CNN,

3040
02:08:53,560 --> 02:08:58,560
Bloomberg,
probably once a week for three or four 

3041
02:08:58,560 --> 02:08:58,560
years.
I was on something.

3042
02:08:58,560 --> 02:09:01,120
And then I used to get the Washington 
Post used to call me the New York Times.

3043
02:09:01,320 --> 02:09:01,750
You know,
I,

3044
02:09:01,760 --> 02:09:06,760
you know,
people magazine articles were written 

3045
02:09:06,760 --> 02:09:09,361
about me when I was just lone kind of 
crazy guy talking about a housing 

3046
02:09:09,361 --> 02:09:13,561
bubble,
talking about a financial crisis that 

3047
02:09:13,561 --> 02:09:15,391
was coming.
They at least gave me a platform to air 

3048
02:09:15,391 --> 02:09:17,790
my views even though they mocked them 
and laugh at them.

3049
02:09:17,950 --> 02:09:20,440
I was still there.
I was like the gloom and doom guy,

3050
02:09:20,470 --> 02:09:21,610
Dr.
Doom.

3051
02:09:21,930 --> 02:09:26,930
Um,
I think Time magazine did an article 

3052
02:09:26,930 --> 02:09:26,930
with me.
I had to pay,

3053
02:09:26,930 --> 02:09:26,930
had a sickle in my hand,
you know,

3054
02:09:26,930 --> 02:09:29,560
like the grim reaper.
But anyway,

3055
02:09:29,770 --> 02:09:32,260
so then,
then we get the financial crisis and all

3056
02:09:32,261 --> 02:09:34,360
of a sudden I get a little bit of 
notoriety,

3057
02:09:34,361 --> 02:09:35,480
you knows,
to Domus Ah,

3058
02:09:35,590 --> 02:09:36,430
Peter Schiff was right.

3059
02:09:36,940 --> 02:09:41,740
But all in all over the last few years 
that nobody will talk to me.

3060
02:09:41,741 --> 02:09:44,170
I'm not on any television shows about 
it.

3061
02:09:44,620 --> 02:09:45,100
Well,
I,

3062
02:09:45,120 --> 02:09:48,490
I think that at this point people just 
think,

3063
02:09:48,491 --> 02:09:48,930
look,
you know,

3064
02:09:49,080 --> 02:09:51,700
I've been saying talking about this 
problem for so long.

3065
02:09:51,701 --> 02:09:53,350
They look,
he doesn't know what he's talking about.

3066
02:09:53,351 --> 02:09:58,351
They forget that I was warning about the
problems in the housing market for four 

3067
02:09:58,351 --> 02:09:58,420
or five years.
You know,

3068
02:09:58,421 --> 02:10:00,460
as the prices kept going up,
you know,

3069
02:10:00,550 --> 02:10:02,890
it's not like the things that I see 
happen immediately,

3070
02:10:03,220 --> 02:10:04,280
but I think,
you know,

3071
02:10:04,480 --> 02:10:09,480
at this point,
maybe in the past they thought maybe 

3072
02:10:09,480 --> 02:10:09,730
there was a chance I could be right,
even though it was a slim chance.

3073
02:10:09,731 --> 02:10:12,160
Now they probably think it's impossible 
that I could be right.

3074
02:10:12,310 --> 02:10:17,310
So why even give me any air time.
So I mean like I come on shows like 

3075
02:10:17,310 --> 02:10:17,710
yours and people actually get to hear 
the truth,

3076
02:10:17,860 --> 02:10:20,560
but if you go back to what I was 
actually predicting,

3077
02:10:21,550 --> 02:10:26,260
2008 financial crisis was the beginning 
of the end,

3078
02:10:26,261 --> 02:10:27,040
not the end.

3079
02:10:27,250 --> 02:10:28,660
What I,
what I was predicting.

3080
02:10:28,661 --> 02:10:30,790
And I wrote a book about it,
crash proof,

3081
02:10:30,791 --> 02:10:32,740
how to profit from the coming economic 
collapse.

3082
02:10:32,741 --> 02:10:34,270
It came in February.
Oh seven.

3083
02:10:34,760 --> 02:10:39,760
I said we have this huge bubble.
We have this housing bubble that the 

3084
02:10:39,760 --> 02:10:39,760
Federal Reserve created,
right?

3085
02:10:39,760 --> 02:10:41,960
Not the,
not the private enterprise.

3086
02:10:41,990 --> 02:10:44,240
It was created by government.
And in fact,

3087
02:10:44,270 --> 02:10:47,570
after the financial crisis happened,
Congress had a,

3088
02:10:47,571 --> 02:10:48,500
um,
a,

3089
02:10:48,540 --> 02:10:51,230
a hearing to try to determine why we had
a financial crisis.

3090
02:10:51,320 --> 02:10:56,320
And I tried my best to get invited to 
testify and they refused to let me be 

3091
02:10:56,320 --> 02:10:59,801
there because they didn't have anybody 
there that predicted it because they 

3092
02:10:59,801 --> 02:11:02,190
wanted to basically come to a conclusion
that they had already arrived.

3093
02:11:02,191 --> 02:11:06,290
That was that it was caused by a lack of
regulation and we need more government.

3094
02:11:06,291 --> 02:11:11,291
Right.
So they didn't want me there to say it 

3095
02:11:11,291 --> 02:11:11,291
was caused by government and we needed 
less government,

3096
02:11:11,291 --> 02:11:13,250
although by the way,
I have testified at Congress twice since

3097
02:11:13,251 --> 02:11:16,370
then and both of my testimonies are on,
on the,

3098
02:11:16,390 --> 02:11:16,970
on Youtube.

3099
02:11:16,970 --> 02:11:19,130
And you got to watch him.
It's incredible stuff.

3100
02:11:19,280 --> 02:11:24,280
And in fact after I was on the first 
time I was convinced they would never 

3101
02:11:24,280 --> 02:11:26,330
invite me back because I don't treat 
these guys with the type of respect that

3102
02:11:26,331 --> 02:11:31,331
they normally get.
So I thought they would never invite me 

3103
02:11:31,331 --> 02:11:31,830
back and they actually invited me back.
And then the guy that invited me back on

3104
02:11:31,870 --> 02:11:34,250
fire.
Okay.

3105
02:11:34,460 --> 02:11:35,600
Yeah.
So I'll never.

3106
02:11:35,700 --> 02:11:38,180
There's no way that they're going to 
bring me out again.

3107
02:11:38,750 --> 02:11:43,750
Much better suited for.
I mean in those talk shows they bring 

3108
02:11:43,750 --> 02:11:47,171
you on.
You're so much better suited to doing 

3109
02:11:47,171 --> 02:11:47,530
your own videos or doing something like 
this where you could just go on,

3110
02:11:47,540 --> 02:11:48,040
well,
yeah,

3111
02:11:48,110 --> 02:11:50,990
I mean now,
now see now a complex issues.

3112
02:11:51,140 --> 02:11:56,140
Now I have my own platform.
I have a lot more people who listen to 

3113
02:11:56,140 --> 02:11:57,650
my podcast and who you know then that I 
did back then,

3114
02:11:57,651 --> 02:12:02,651
but the point that I wanted to make 
about the crisis is I wrote back then 

3115
02:12:02,651 --> 02:12:04,280
that we had this bubble and we were 
going to have this crash,

3116
02:12:04,970 --> 02:12:08,660
but the economic crisis was not going to
be that.

3117
02:12:08,660 --> 02:12:11,780
It was that the collapse that I saw 
coming in,

3118
02:12:11,781 --> 02:12:14,840
oh,
eight was the beginning.

3119
02:12:14,960 --> 02:12:19,960
I said that we have this disease that 
the Fed has created and it's manifested 

3120
02:12:19,960 --> 02:12:22,340
itself in this housing bubble and it's 
going to pop and we're going to have the

3121
02:12:22,341 --> 02:12:24,200
worst recession since the great 
depression.

3122
02:12:24,410 --> 02:12:26,270
We're going to have double digit 
unemployment.

3123
02:12:26,271 --> 02:12:27,860
We're going to have trillion dollar 
deficits,

3124
02:12:28,190 --> 02:12:30,290
but I said,
that's not what's going to kill us.

3125
02:12:30,320 --> 02:12:32,690
I said,
we're not going to die of that disease.

3126
02:12:32,780 --> 02:12:35,090
That disease is survivable.
I said,

3127
02:12:35,091 --> 02:12:37,400
what's going to kill us is the 
government's cure.

3128
02:12:37,730 --> 02:12:42,730
They're going to print so much money,
they're going to try to reflate these 

3129
02:12:42,730 --> 02:12:45,650
bubbles and that's going to cause a 
dollar crisis and a bond crisis,

3130
02:12:45,651 --> 02:12:49,010
and that was what was gonna destroy the 
economy and that's not happened yet.

3131
02:12:49,430 --> 02:12:52,700
Now what I did not know at the time,
and I didn't put a date on it,

3132
02:12:53,150 --> 02:12:54,590
I didn't know it would take so long.

3133
02:12:54,710 --> 02:12:56,810
I mean here we are 10 years later 
almost,

3134
02:12:57,110 --> 02:12:58,880
and it has.
That hasn't happened yet,

3135
02:12:58,881 --> 02:13:02,360
but you think it's got to happen and 
what I got wrong,

3136
02:13:02,900 --> 02:13:06,830
I said the government was going to try 
to reflate the bubbles.

3137
02:13:07,130 --> 02:13:09,950
I assume they would fail.
They succeeded.

3138
02:13:10,280 --> 02:13:13,300
The bubbles now are bigger than the ones
that popped in.

3139
02:13:13,301 --> 02:13:18,301
Oh eight.
And what's the difference between 

3140
02:13:18,301 --> 02:13:19,370
bubbles and an actual functioning 
economy that's sustainable,

3141
02:13:19,490 --> 02:13:21,050
right?
So if it's doing well right now,

3142
02:13:21,051 --> 02:13:23,060
you agree it's doing well,
not doing well.

3143
02:13:23,061 --> 02:13:28,061
It's a mobile.
So the difference between a real 

3144
02:13:28,061 --> 02:13:30,761
economy,
the real economy grows from production 

3145
02:13:30,761 --> 02:13:30,761
and savings,
right?

3146
02:13:30,761 --> 02:13:30,761
And the real.

3147
02:13:32,030 --> 02:13:37,030
We're making stuff and consuming.
Like if you look right now at the 

3148
02:13:37,030 --> 02:13:37,030
savings rate,
right?

3149
02:13:37,030 --> 02:13:40,530
The savings rate is near record low and 
the politicians try to say,

3150
02:13:40,770 --> 02:13:42,870
oh,
this is because the economy is so good,

3151
02:13:42,900 --> 02:13:44,430
right?
Everybody is out there spending.

3152
02:13:44,520 --> 02:13:47,370
That's a bunch of nonsense.
If the economy was good,

3153
02:13:47,371 --> 02:13:48,810
people would have more savings.
Right?

3154
02:13:48,811 --> 02:13:49,080
If,
if,

3155
02:13:49,260 --> 02:13:54,260
if you ran into a friend of yours that 
you hadn't seen in awhile and you ask 

3156
02:13:54,260 --> 02:13:54,260
them,
hey,

3157
02:13:54,260 --> 02:13:55,050
how you doing?
And he said,

3158
02:13:55,200 --> 02:13:57,270
Oh,
well I've maxed out all my credit cards.

3159
02:13:57,271 --> 02:13:59,430
I took out a second mortgage on my 
house.

3160
02:13:59,640 --> 02:14:00,430
You know,
I,

3161
02:14:00,490 --> 02:14:03,030
I blew through my retirement account.
Right?

3162
02:14:03,240 --> 02:14:04,020
You wouldn't say,
Oh,

3163
02:14:04,021 --> 02:14:07,170
you're doing great work.
Whereas if another friend said,

3164
02:14:07,380 --> 02:14:08,340
how you do it?
Oh,

3165
02:14:08,341 --> 02:14:11,760
I just fully funded my pension.
I got massive savings.

3166
02:14:11,761 --> 02:14:12,350
I got,
you know,

3167
02:14:12,510 --> 02:14:14,610
I mean,
I paid off all my credit cards.

3168
02:14:14,610 --> 02:14:18,050
I own my house free and clear.
That's the guy that's doing well right?

3169
02:14:18,120 --> 02:14:19,440
When you're,
when you're doing well,

3170
02:14:19,550 --> 02:14:20,850
you,
you get out of debt.

3171
02:14:21,420 --> 02:14:25,440
So we're not doing that.
We're all living based on a bubble based

3172
02:14:25,441 --> 02:14:28,470
on cheap money being spread out into the
economy.

3173
02:14:28,560 --> 02:14:30,240
Right?
Why is the stock market going up?

3174
02:14:30,241 --> 02:14:32,850
Because the buybacks.
Why are people spending,

3175
02:14:32,851 --> 02:14:36,180
because they're going deeper into debt.
We have record student loans,

3176
02:14:36,270 --> 02:14:40,020
record credit card debt record autodebt.
Everybody's loaded up with that.

3177
02:14:40,021 --> 02:14:45,021
They just had a survey out.
I think that less than half the people 

3178
02:14:45,021 --> 02:14:48,210
could come up with like 400 bucks if 
they had an emergency.

3179
02:14:48,390 --> 02:14:49,650
I mean,
that's nothing.

3180
02:14:49,920 --> 02:14:54,920
People have nothing.
They're living paycheck to paycheck and 

3181
02:14:54,920 --> 02:14:54,920
even that they,
they,

3182
02:14:54,920 --> 02:14:57,270
they need credit cards.
We have huge budget deficits.

3183
02:14:57,271 --> 02:14:59,020
We have huge trade deficits.
You know,

3184
02:14:59,090 --> 02:15:01,850
we got record numbers of people,
older people that,

3185
02:15:01,890 --> 02:15:04,170
that are working because they can't 
afford to retire.

3186
02:15:04,380 --> 02:15:09,380
Meanwhile,
the young people can't get jobs because 

3187
02:15:09,380 --> 02:15:09,380
they have those skills and they're 
still.

3188
02:15:09,380 --> 02:15:09,930
So the economy is not real,
right?

3189
02:15:09,931 --> 02:15:11,630
It's all,
it's all disillusion.

3190
02:15:11,760 --> 02:15:16,760
Just like it was what was going on 
before 2008 people were living off their

3191
02:15:17,701 --> 02:15:18,600
home equity.
You know,

3192
02:15:18,601 --> 02:15:21,210
out here in California,
homes are going up.

3193
02:15:21,211 --> 02:15:23,520
People were taking out home equity lines
of credit.

3194
02:15:23,700 --> 02:15:26,850
They were taken vacations,
they were buying new cars,

3195
02:15:26,851 --> 02:15:30,630
they were remodeling their houses.
All that prosperity was phony.

3196
02:15:30,660 --> 02:15:33,240
It wasn't run well upon fake wealth.
Yes.

3197
02:15:33,241 --> 02:15:36,330
And then the wealth came down and I 
talked about that for years,

3198
02:15:36,331 --> 02:15:39,600
what we have even faker prosperity now,
but it's not,

3199
02:15:39,601 --> 02:15:44,601
it's even less prosperous.
Even fewer people are feeling the 

3200
02:15:44,601 --> 02:15:44,601
benefits,
uh,

3201
02:15:44,601 --> 02:15:49,310
than before.
So the real economy is getting sicker 

3202
02:15:49,310 --> 02:15:52,341
and sicker as it takes more and more air
to inflate the bubble because in order 

3203
02:15:52,341 --> 02:15:56,331
to keep the bubbles from popping,
the government and the central bank has 

3204
02:15:56,331 --> 02:15:59,970
to keep misdirecting resources out of 
the real economy to sustain the bubbles.

3205
02:16:00,050 --> 02:16:02,050
All right,
so talk me through two things.

3206
02:16:02,051 --> 02:16:07,051
One,
what is going to happen that's going to 

3207
02:16:07,051 --> 02:16:09,841
cause this big collapse?
You predicted way back in 2007 that 

3208
02:16:09,841 --> 02:16:11,230
hasn't actually hit yet.
What's going to cause that?

3209
02:16:11,231 --> 02:16:16,231
How's it going to go down?
And what can the average person like me 

3210
02:16:16,231 --> 02:16:18,490
that knows Jack Shit about economics?
What can we do to protect ourselves?

3211
02:16:18,670 --> 02:16:19,120
Well,
first of all,

3212
02:16:19,121 --> 02:16:24,121
you probably know more about economics 
than the average guy with an economics 

3213
02:16:24,121 --> 02:16:24,850
degree from American University to you.
Well,

3214
02:16:24,851 --> 02:16:26,410
yeah,
or just for having common sense.

3215
02:16:26,411 --> 02:16:26,780
I mean,
when,

3216
02:16:26,920 --> 02:16:29,200
when you go to a US college and you 
study economics,

3217
02:16:29,350 --> 02:16:31,480
they basically beat all the common sense
out of you,

3218
02:16:31,660 --> 02:16:34,360
and by the time you graduate,
you're a complete moron when it comes to

3219
02:16:34,361 --> 02:16:35,590
economics,
how do they do?

3220
02:16:35,950 --> 02:16:38,340
What would they teach them?
All this nonsense,

3221
02:16:38,550 --> 02:16:38,890
you know,
that,

3222
02:16:38,910 --> 02:16:39,570
you know,
and,

3223
02:16:39,590 --> 02:16:43,840
and that's why all the big economists in
academia on Wall Street,

3224
02:16:43,841 --> 02:16:48,841
at government,
they're all a bunch of idiots when it 

3225
02:16:48,841 --> 02:16:48,841
comes to economics.
So you know,

3226
02:16:48,841 --> 02:16:48,910
a lot more than they do.
Uh,

3227
02:16:48,940 --> 02:16:50,260
not that you're,
you're an idiot.

3228
02:16:50,261 --> 02:16:51,010
But I mean,
you just,

3229
02:16:51,100 --> 02:16:53,530
you just have to have common sense 
because they lack lack,

3230
02:16:53,531 --> 02:16:55,390
common sense.
But to get back to your question,

3231
02:16:55,560 --> 02:16:56,260
this is horrible.

3232
02:16:56,460 --> 02:17:01,460
This is going to go down.
This is how I think it's going to go 

3233
02:17:01,460 --> 02:17:03,571
down.
So everybody believes that the Fed's 

3234
02:17:03,571 --> 02:17:05,070
policy of quantitative easing,
uh,

3235
02:17:05,080 --> 02:17:06,330
and you know,
and uh,

3236
02:17:06,460 --> 02:17:07,060
and uh,
you know,

3237
02:17:07,061 --> 02:17:10,540
low zero percent interest rates,
everybody believes it was a success.

3238
02:17:10,630 --> 02:17:13,970
They believe the Fed revive the economy,
that they put out the fire.

3239
02:17:13,971 --> 02:17:14,720
That's the narrative,
right?

3240
02:17:14,830 --> 02:17:19,830
They still don't realize that the Fed 
lit the fire and they didn't really put 

3241
02:17:19,830 --> 02:17:19,830
it out.
It's just Kinda,

3242
02:17:19,830 --> 02:17:20,710
it's simmering and people don't notice 
it.

3243
02:17:21,160 --> 02:17:23,140
But um,
what,

3244
02:17:23,220 --> 02:17:27,640
what's going to happen is the Fed never 
was able to normalize interest rates,

3245
02:17:27,641 --> 02:17:29,380
right?
Rates or stole two percent.

3246
02:17:29,440 --> 02:17:30,850
That's still really,
really low.

3247
02:17:31,090 --> 02:17:33,760
And for all the talk about shrinking 
their balance sheet,

3248
02:17:33,880 --> 02:17:35,160
it really hasn't shrunk,
right?

3249
02:17:35,161 --> 02:17:40,161
It's still enormous and I think that the
economy is going to slip into recession,

3250
02:17:40,330 --> 02:17:40,600
right?

3251
02:17:41,020 --> 02:17:44,590
And when it does,
the Fed never got interest rates back to

3252
02:17:44,620 --> 02:17:47,110
five percent or six percent where they 
normally bring them.

3253
02:17:47,650 --> 02:17:52,650
They never shrink the balance sheet.
So now all of a sudden we go into this 

3254
02:17:52,650 --> 02:17:52,720
recession,
but it's going to be as a,

3255
02:17:52,780 --> 02:17:57,780
a,
a stagflation because inflation is now 

3256
02:17:57,780 --> 02:17:57,780
really starting to pick up,
you know,

3257
02:17:57,780 --> 02:18:02,340
prices rise with a lag.
The inflation is the expansion of the 

3258
02:18:02,340 --> 02:18:03,430
money supply.
That's what the word inflate means.

3259
02:18:03,490 --> 02:18:04,930
It comes,
it's to expand,

3260
02:18:04,931 --> 02:18:06,670
right?
You can't expand prices.

3261
02:18:06,671 --> 02:18:11,671
Prices can go up and they go down,
they go and expand what expands as the 

3262
02:18:11,671 --> 02:18:15,121
supply of money.
And so the supply of money expanded and 

3263
02:18:15,121 --> 02:18:16,240
a lot of that went into financial 
assets.

3264
02:18:16,241 --> 02:18:18,520
So inflation costs,
stock prices to go up,

3265
02:18:18,521 --> 02:18:20,140
it caused real estate,
prices go up,

3266
02:18:20,320 --> 02:18:24,700
it caused bond prices go up,
it caused the price of rare art to go up

3267
02:18:24,701 --> 02:18:27,460
and all sorts of things went up because 
of inflation.

3268
02:18:27,800 --> 02:18:32,800
Uh,
ultimately a lot of that inflation that 

3269
02:18:32,800 --> 02:18:32,800
was going to end up in the supermarket,
right?

3270
02:18:32,800 --> 02:18:33,000
You know,
at,

3271
02:18:33,001 --> 02:18:34,300
at the,
at the gas station.

3272
02:18:34,301 --> 02:18:39,301
And,
and so you're going to have that at the 

3273
02:18:39,301 --> 02:18:40,651
same time that we have the recession.
Now the Fed is going to have to go back 

3274
02:18:40,901 --> 02:18:45,901
to the only thing it knows how to do.
We're going to do qe four and we're 

3275
02:18:45,901 --> 02:18:49,921
going to cut rates back to zero.
But now the markets are going to see 

3276
02:18:49,921 --> 02:18:53,680
this and they're going to wait a minute.
You never normalized interest rates,

3277
02:18:53,830 --> 02:18:57,520
you never shrunk your balance sheet.
And now you're going to expand it again.

3278
02:18:57,790 --> 02:19:00,250
Now you're going back to zero.
Wait a minute,

3279
02:19:00,251 --> 02:19:03,910
wait a minute.
If you couldn't normalize interest rates

3280
02:19:04,300 --> 02:19:09,300
following this last recession,
how are you going to do it in the 

3281
02:19:09,300 --> 02:19:09,760
future?
I mean if you couldn't shrink a four and

3282
02:19:09,761 --> 02:19:12,290
a half trillion dollar balance sheet,
how are you going to drink?

3283
02:19:12,490 --> 02:19:17,490
Drink a six or a $7,000,000,000,000
balance sheet if you couldn't raise 

3284
02:19:17,490 --> 02:19:18,460
interest rates back to normal when the 
national debt,

3285
02:19:18,670 --> 02:19:22,870
our national debt is not 21 trillion.
What if it goes up to 25 trillion,

3286
02:19:22,871 --> 02:19:24,250
30 trillion?
I mean,

3287
02:19:24,251 --> 02:19:27,530
one of the reasons the Fed can't raise 
rates is because we have too debt.

3288
02:19:27,740 --> 02:19:32,740
Nobody can afford to pay the higher 
rates when inflation was running out of 

3289
02:19:32,740 --> 02:19:35,750
control in the 19 seventies and it's 
going to be a lot worse now.

3290
02:19:35,751 --> 02:19:40,751
Right?
The inflation that we had in the 19 

3291
02:19:40,751 --> 02:19:42,470
seventies was created in the 19 sixties 
by Lyndon Johnson,

3292
02:19:42,590 --> 02:19:45,590
right by the great society,
the war on poverty,

3293
02:19:45,710 --> 02:19:47,990
the Vietnam War,
going to the moon.

3294
02:19:48,020 --> 02:19:53,020
We borrowed all sorts of money.
We ran big deficits and the consequence 

3295
02:19:53,020 --> 02:19:55,910
was the dollar crashed in the seventies.
Gold went through the roof,

3296
02:19:55,970 --> 02:19:58,850
oil went through the roof and finally,
you know,

3297
02:19:58,851 --> 02:20:01,950
we had to do something about it at the 
end of the seventies because when,

3298
02:20:01,951 --> 02:20:02,360
when,
when,

3299
02:20:02,390 --> 02:20:05,840
when Nixon came in and uh,
and Ford came in,

3300
02:20:05,880 --> 02:20:08,210
they just continued the same policies.

3301
02:20:08,210 --> 02:20:11,300
They were know very liberal Republicans,
Rockefeller Republicans,

3302
02:20:12,140 --> 02:20:17,140
and we didn't do anything about 
inflation until Reagan came in and 

3303
02:20:17,140 --> 02:20:19,811
Volcker was there.
And so how did they stop the inflation 

3304
02:20:19,811 --> 02:20:23,261
from running out of control?
Volcker jacked interest rates up to 20 

3305
02:20:23,261 --> 02:20:23,270
percent,
20 percent.

3306
02:20:23,360 --> 02:20:26,960
And we had a recession where the Fed was
raising interest rates,

3307
02:20:27,230 --> 02:20:30,170
but that saved the dollar and it,
it,

3308
02:20:30,180 --> 02:20:35,180
it broke the inflationary cycle that was
in the economy raising the interest 

3309
02:20:35,180 --> 02:20:35,180
rates.
Yes they will.

3310
02:20:35,180 --> 02:20:36,520
They had to stop the inflation,
right?

3311
02:20:36,530 --> 02:20:37,020
They had,
they had,

3312
02:20:37,110 --> 02:20:38,540
they had,
they had a break and of course,

3313
02:20:38,630 --> 02:20:39,770
you know,
Reagan did some other,

3314
02:20:39,800 --> 02:20:41,300
you know,
tax reform and things like that.

3315
02:20:41,301 --> 02:20:43,340
But the Fed really finally,
you know,

3316
02:20:43,341 --> 02:20:48,341
got,
got out in front of the inflation curve 

3317
02:20:48,341 --> 02:20:50,710
and they brought it down.
But if you think about the difference 

3318
02:20:50,710 --> 02:20:53,120
between the United States in 1980 and 
the United States today,

3319
02:20:53,270 --> 02:20:56,690
we were still the world's biggest 
creditor nation in 1980,

3320
02:20:56,730 --> 02:20:58,280
not the world's biggest debtor nation.

3321
02:20:58,520 --> 02:21:00,920
The national debt was a fraction of what
it is now.

3322
02:21:00,921 --> 02:21:02,480
I don't know,
maybe it was like a half a billion,

3323
02:21:02,630 --> 02:21:04,490
500 billion or I don't know the exact 
amount,

3324
02:21:04,491 --> 02:21:06,830
but well under a trillion,
um,

3325
02:21:07,130 --> 02:21:12,130
but the,
the national debt was financed with long

3326
02:21:12,431 --> 02:21:17,431
term bonds like 10 year 30 year bonds.
So when interest rates went up to 20 

3327
02:21:18,111 --> 02:21:23,111
percent,
that didn't affect the majority of the 

3328
02:21:23,111 --> 02:21:26,291
debt that was out there,
that only increased the cost to the 

3329
02:21:26,291 --> 02:21:27,950
government of the new debt that came 
out,

3330
02:21:27,951 --> 02:21:28,850
right?
The new borrowing.

3331
02:21:29,030 --> 02:21:34,030
But today the $21,000,000,000,000
national debt is predominantly treasury 

3332
02:21:34,461 --> 02:21:36,710
bills,
stuff that matures in a year or less.

3333
02:21:37,220 --> 02:21:39,470
And,
and so if interest rates had to go up to

3334
02:21:39,471 --> 02:21:44,471
let's say 10 percent,
the government would have to pay 10 

3335
02:21:44,471 --> 02:21:45,560
percent within a few years on the entire
national debt.

3336
02:21:45,890 --> 02:21:48,110
So where were the government get all 
that money?

3337
02:21:48,350 --> 02:21:49,060
And it's not this.

3338
02:21:49,070 --> 02:21:51,650
The government corporations have never 
been this levered up.

3339
02:21:51,940 --> 02:21:54,070
Individuals have never been this level 
of.

3340
02:21:54,110 --> 02:21:56,330
They didn't have adjustable rate 
mortgages back then.

3341
02:21:56,331 --> 02:22:01,331
You know,
now you've got to have a lot of people 

3342
02:22:01,331 --> 02:22:01,331
that have arms,
you know,

3343
02:22:01,331 --> 02:22:01,331
we're,
you know,

3344
02:22:01,331 --> 02:22:05,010
their mortgage debt would go up with.
So at this point the Fed can't really 

3345
02:22:05,010 --> 02:22:09,260
fight inflation because it doesn't have 
the tools because we have so much debt.

3346
02:22:09,440 --> 02:22:12,680
If they raised interest rates to fight 
inflation,

3347
02:22:13,070 --> 02:22:15,920
the collapse would be so much worse than
2008.

3348
02:22:16,010 --> 02:22:18,590
All the banks that they bailed,
that would fail again,

3349
02:22:18,830 --> 02:22:23,830
but they couldn't bail them out a second
time because they can't bail them out 

3350
02:22:23,830 --> 02:22:27,491
and fight inflation at the same time 
because you can't ease and tightened 

3351
02:22:27,491 --> 02:22:27,690
simultaneously.
It's one or the other.

3352
02:22:27,750 --> 02:22:32,340
So I think when the markets see that 
we're going back to Qe,

3353
02:22:32,550 --> 02:22:37,550
that we're going back to zero,
they're going to realize that this is 

3354
02:22:37,550 --> 02:22:38,220
not temporary,
that this is permanent,

3355
02:22:38,460 --> 02:22:41,040
that the Fed can never normalize 
interest rates.

3356
02:22:41,160 --> 02:22:43,260
That the balance sheet is never going to
shrink.

3357
02:22:43,380 --> 02:22:46,680
That we're a banana republic,
that we are monetizing our debt,

3358
02:22:46,980 --> 02:22:51,980
that the Fed has no ability to drain 
that liquidity and no ability to fight 

3359
02:22:51,980 --> 02:22:56,331
inflation.
That means the dollar is a bottomless 

3360
02:22:56,331 --> 02:22:58,761
pit.
That means a dollar is going to keep 

3361
02:22:58,761 --> 02:23:00,621
falling.
That means nobody is going to want to 

3362
02:23:00,621 --> 02:23:00,621
own it and everybody's going to want to 
get out of dollars and everybody's going

3363
02:23:00,621 --> 02:23:05,351
to want to get out of any bond that has 
dollar denominated in dollars and then 

3364
02:23:05,351 --> 02:23:06,780
the Federal Reserve in order to keep 
interest rates from rising,

3365
02:23:06,930 --> 02:23:08,760
they might have to start buying Muni 
bonds,

3366
02:23:08,880 --> 02:23:10,740
they might have to start buying 
corporate bonds.

3367
02:23:10,741 --> 02:23:15,741
Otherwise interest rates are going to 
skyrocket and that just fuels the 

3368
02:23:15,741 --> 02:23:19,041
inflationary fire.
And then we get a currency crisis right 

3369
02:23:19,041 --> 02:23:21,210
where the dollar is plunging.
Prices are skyrocketing,

3370
02:23:21,450 --> 02:23:24,120
that is real pain and who knows what 
they're going to do.

3371
02:23:24,240 --> 02:23:29,240
Maybe they're going to have a price 
controls which are just going to 

3372
02:23:29,240 --> 02:23:29,490
backfire.
Then we're going to have shortages.

3373
02:23:29,491 --> 02:23:32,100
We're going to have rationing.
We're going to have civil unrest.

3374
02:23:32,101 --> 02:23:37,101
I mean,
this is going to be ugly when it hits 

3375
02:23:37,101 --> 02:23:39,921
the fan and you know,
it's dangerous to do this and the 

3376
02:23:39,921 --> 02:23:41,820
backdrop where so many people are 
inclined to vote for a socialist because

3377
02:23:41,821 --> 02:23:46,821
that's going to be the type of economic 
environment where socialism can thrive 

3378
02:23:46,821 --> 02:23:50,811
because socialists always want to look 
for a scapegoat who can we blame this on

3379
02:23:51,150 --> 02:23:56,150
and it's very easy to blame it on the 
rich or the businesses or the 

3380
02:23:56,150 --> 02:23:59,181
corporations or the Republicans.
And I think that's what's gonna happen 

3381
02:23:59,181 --> 02:23:59,550
if this happens,
you know,

3382
02:23:59,580 --> 02:24:04,580
sometime over the next few years.
But if it doesn't happen in trump's 

3383
02:24:04,580 --> 02:24:07,431
first term,
there's no way he finishes his second 

3384
02:24:07,431 --> 02:24:09,000
term without this happening.
No Way I can ask you this.

3385
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:12,510
If he calls you and says Peter Schiff 
had on the Joe Rogan podcast,

3386
02:24:12,530 --> 02:24:14,910
it was amazing.
What do I do?

3387
02:24:15,420 --> 02:24:16,790
What do you tell them to do?
You know,

3388
02:24:16,910 --> 02:24:21,910
I think he has people that were 
listening to me on the campaign trail 

3389
02:24:21,910 --> 02:24:25,611
because I used to,
I would say things on my podcast or 

3390
02:24:25,611 --> 02:24:25,611
tweet something and the next day I,
you know,

3391
02:24:25,611 --> 02:24:27,200
he'd say something pretty similar.
So just like,

3392
02:24:27,510 --> 02:24:29,220
because he,
my rhetoric,

3393
02:24:29,221 --> 02:24:29,490
uh,
Pete,

3394
02:24:29,550 --> 02:24:31,740
he had to appeal to certain voters that,
you know,

3395
02:24:31,741 --> 02:24:33,600
and so he was throwing them this type of
red meat.

3396
02:24:33,990 --> 02:24:34,620
But look,
look,

3397
02:24:34,621 --> 02:24:37,440
I know some of the guys that are close 
to him,

3398
02:24:37,800 --> 02:24:38,600
you know,
uh,

3399
02:24:38,640 --> 02:24:41,430
like Larry Kudlow,
like Steve Moore.

3400
02:24:41,610 --> 02:24:42,090
Uh,
I mean,

3401
02:24:42,091 --> 02:24:47,091
I,
I know Steve Moore pretty well at 

3402
02:24:47,091 --> 02:24:47,091
[inaudible].
We speak in a lot of the same things.

3403
02:24:47,091 --> 02:24:48,150
I used to be on Larry's show a lot back 
in the day when he used to have his,

3404
02:24:48,420 --> 02:24:50,430
his,
his show on CNBC.

3405
02:24:50,940 --> 02:24:52,680
Um,
so I know some of these guys,

3406
02:24:52,681 --> 02:24:54,180
I don't know her as well,
but,

3407
02:24:54,181 --> 02:24:55,140
you know,
art laffer,

3408
02:24:55,141 --> 02:25:00,141
right?
If you go look at the debate I did with 

3409
02:25:00,141 --> 02:25:00,141
Art Laffer,
uh,

3410
02:25:00,141 --> 02:25:00,900
in 2006 when he said everything was 
great,

3411
02:25:01,170 --> 02:25:02,010
uh,
and you know,

3412
02:25:02,011 --> 02:25:04,170
there's no,
no recession coming and then he bet me a

3413
02:25:04,171 --> 02:25:05,770
penny and Wellstar on it.
I mean,

3414
02:25:05,771 --> 02:25:06,840
if you can't even send.
Yeah,

3415
02:25:06,841 --> 02:25:11,841
well yeah,
he bet me a penny that everything was 

3416
02:25:11,841 --> 02:25:14,811
great and there was nothing to worry 
about and we weren't gonna have a major 

3417
02:25:14,811 --> 02:25:15,900
decline and you know,
and then he wouldn't even pay up,

3418
02:25:15,980 --> 02:25:17,190
you know,
but let me ask you this.

3419
02:25:17,191 --> 02:25:19,380
If he calls you up and says,
what do I do,

3420
02:25:19,500 --> 02:25:20,860
what does he do?
Well,

3421
02:25:20,880 --> 02:25:21,810
at this point,
look,

3422
02:25:22,170 --> 02:25:23,680
it would have been better,
as I said,

3423
02:25:23,681 --> 02:25:24,010
had he

3424
02:25:24,010 --> 02:25:27,130
come clean right away about what does he
do now?

3425
02:25:27,460 --> 02:25:29,260
Now he's got to have to come back and 
say,

3426
02:25:29,261 --> 02:25:34,261
look,
I just listened to the Joe Rogan 

3427
02:25:34,261 --> 02:25:35,941
podcast.
I listened to Peter Schiff and you guys 

3428
02:25:35,941 --> 02:25:37,710
guys a genius.
Financial Genius is huge.

3429
02:25:37,810 --> 02:25:40,690
I'm not a genius.
I just have common sense.

3430
02:25:40,810 --> 02:25:42,790
It's,
it's these other guys that are just,

3431
02:25:42,960 --> 02:25:43,500
you know,
they're,

3432
02:25:43,510 --> 02:25:44,320
they're,
they're so,

3433
02:25:44,370 --> 02:25:49,370
they're,
their judgment is so clouded by the 

3434
02:25:49,370 --> 02:25:49,370
bubble.
That's,

3435
02:25:49,370 --> 02:25:52,411
you know,
when you get a lot of people that can 

3436
02:25:52,411 --> 02:25:52,411
see things.
The reason I saw the crisis coming,

3437
02:25:52,411 --> 02:25:52,510
uh,
you know,

3438
02:25:52,570 --> 02:25:54,850
the housing bubble,
it wasn't that I was so smart,

3439
02:25:55,090 --> 02:26:00,090
I just,
I was just thinking clearly everybody 

3440
02:26:00,090 --> 02:26:00,090
else was so delusional.
But what does he do though?

3441
02:26:00,090 --> 02:26:00,090
Yeah,
I mean,

3442
02:26:00,090 --> 02:26:03,430
so what he's got to do is basically has 
got to come clean now and tell the truth

3443
02:26:03,431 --> 02:26:08,431
about how screwed up this country is 
after years of big government and after 

3444
02:26:08,431 --> 02:26:11,560
years of a central bank that is inflated
bubble after bubble and say,

3445
02:26:11,561 --> 02:26:16,561
look,
this is what we need to do to really 

3446
02:26:16,561 --> 02:26:16,561
make America great again.

3447
02:26:16,561 --> 02:26:20,540
I said,
we're going to have to shrink 

3448
02:26:20,540 --> 02:26:22,021
government.
I know I said I wasn't going to cut 

3449
02:26:22,021 --> 02:26:22,021
entitlements,
but we got to do that.

3450
02:26:22,021 --> 02:26:22,720
We can't afford to make these 
commitments.

3451
02:26:22,810 --> 02:26:25,960
We can't pay all of his social security 
benefits that have been promised because

3452
02:26:25,961 --> 02:26:28,300
if we try,
we're going to destroy the dollar,

3453
02:26:28,450 --> 02:26:33,450
right?
Because if the government tries to give 

3454
02:26:33,450 --> 02:26:35,581
everybody a social security check,
they can't do it without destroying the 

3455
02:26:35,581 --> 02:26:35,581
dollar.
So we've got to,

3456
02:26:35,581 --> 02:26:38,140
we've got to shrink the program.
We've got a means tested program,

3457
02:26:38,290 --> 02:26:40,720
we've got to make it a lot smaller.
We got to end it for the future.

3458
02:26:40,780 --> 02:26:45,780
You know,
we can't have this intergenerational 

3459
02:26:45,780 --> 02:26:45,780
Ponzi scheme,
uh,

3460
02:26:45,780 --> 02:26:45,780
that,
you know,

3461
02:26:45,780 --> 02:26:46,960
it was a mistake to create it.
I mean,

3462
02:26:46,961 --> 02:26:51,961
a lot,
nobody wants to admit that social 

3463
02:26:51,961 --> 02:26:51,961
security was a mistake,
that Medicare was a mistake.

3464
02:26:51,961 --> 02:26:56,251
You know,
one of the things about social security 

3465
02:26:56,251 --> 02:26:56,710
that's been harped on and on is that one
day it's not going to work.

3466
02:26:56,740 --> 02:26:57,550
Well,
it doesn't work.

3467
02:26:57,670 --> 02:27:02,670
It's never worked,
but the idea is that you're paying into 

3468
02:27:02,670 --> 02:27:02,670
it.
Now.

3469
02:27:02,670 --> 02:27:02,670
If you're your 30 year old person paying
into it,

3470
02:27:02,670 --> 02:27:04,540
now this straight on odds,
you're not going to get it,

3471
02:27:04,541 --> 02:27:06,270
but you're not paying into anything.
I mean,

3472
02:27:06,370 --> 02:27:11,370
social security is a Ponzi scheme.
It's not a legitimately funded 

3473
02:27:11,370 --> 02:27:12,730
retirement program.
It's not like your social security money

3474
02:27:12,940 --> 02:27:17,020
is putting a real trust funds somewhere 
in invested and when you retire,

3475
02:27:17,140 --> 02:27:19,000
you're going to get payments out of this
trust fund.

3476
02:27:19,020 --> 02:27:24,020
No,
your money is going to the people that 

3477
02:27:24,020 --> 02:27:24,020
are spending it right now.
Yeah,

3478
02:27:24,020 --> 02:27:24,910
and so when it first started,
social security started a long time ago.

3479
02:27:24,911 --> 02:27:29,911
The first woman that got a check was,
I'm more fuller or something was her 

3480
02:27:29,911 --> 02:27:30,460
name,
and she lived to be 100 years old.

3481
02:27:30,820 --> 02:27:35,820
And for her social security was a.
was a windfall because she paid into it 

3482
02:27:35,820 --> 02:27:36,190
for a couple of years.

3483
02:27:36,280 --> 02:27:40,090
She collected for like 40 years and when
full security started,

3484
02:27:40,240 --> 02:27:43,870
it was a one percent tax on payroll and 
it was only a small amount.

3485
02:27:43,871 --> 02:27:46,870
And then the employer paid one percent,
which of course comes from the employee.

3486
02:27:47,020 --> 02:27:48,220
That's part of the fraud,
right?

3487
02:27:48,221 --> 02:27:49,870
I mean the employee pays the whole 
thing.

3488
02:27:50,010 --> 02:27:52,060
Doesn't matter if the,
if it's considered the employer,

3489
02:27:52,240 --> 02:27:53,340
but it didn't.
So,

3490
02:27:53,560 --> 02:27:54,310
uh,
uh,

3491
02:27:54,340 --> 02:27:56,440
I'm self employed.
People weren't even included.

3492
02:27:56,470 --> 02:27:59,230
I think we didn't include the self 
employed until like the fifties,

3493
02:27:59,550 --> 02:28:00,820
Greg,
because the government figured if you're

3494
02:28:00,821 --> 02:28:05,821
smart enough to run your own business,
well then you're smart enough to save 

3495
02:28:05,821 --> 02:28:05,821
for your own retirement.
Uh,

3496
02:28:05,821 --> 02:28:06,880
but the government tried to say,
look,

3497
02:28:06,881 --> 02:28:09,070
some Americans are not smart enough to 
save,

3498
02:28:09,071 --> 02:28:14,071
which I think was a mistake because the 
government didn't save anything because 

3499
02:28:14,071 --> 02:28:14,440
what the government did is the minute 
they got the money,

3500
02:28:14,441 --> 02:28:15,130
they spent it.

3501
02:28:15,670 --> 02:28:20,670
But before they spend it,
they write themselves an Iou and they 

3502
02:28:20,670 --> 02:28:23,911
call it a trust fund.
See what happens is the government 

3503
02:28:23,911 --> 02:28:26,471
collects the social,
social security money and then they 

3504
02:28:26,471 --> 02:28:27,950
spend the money on the current 
employees,

3505
02:28:28,400 --> 02:28:30,090
but what they don't spend,
they,

3506
02:28:30,091 --> 02:28:30,480
they,
they,

3507
02:28:30,540 --> 02:28:35,540
they put into this so called trust fund,
but then they borrow it right out and 

3508
02:28:35,540 --> 02:28:36,500
they write themselves an iou call the 
government bond.

3509
02:28:36,830 --> 02:28:41,830
But if the government owns its own bond,
that's not an asset because they keep 

3510
02:28:41,830 --> 02:28:46,001
saying,
well the trust funds are going to be 

3511
02:28:46,001 --> 02:28:46,001
solvent until the year 20,
40 or something like that,

3512
02:28:46,001 --> 02:28:50,801
but they're not.
They're insolvent right now because 

3513
02:28:50,801 --> 02:28:50,990
there's nothing in them.
Because if the government has to tap the

3514
02:28:50,991 --> 02:28:53,900
trust fund,
it has to sell a bond to the public,

3515
02:28:54,170 --> 02:28:59,170
which is what it would do if there was 
no trust when it's like if you wrote me 

3516
02:28:59,170 --> 02:29:01,010
a check for $10,000,
right?

3517
02:29:01,580 --> 02:29:03,770
And I had that check.
That would be an asset to me.

3518
02:29:03,950 --> 02:29:08,950
If I had your check for $10,000,
if you wrote yourself a check for 

3519
02:29:08,950 --> 02:29:12,431
$10,000,
that's not an asset to you because it's 

3520
02:29:12,431 --> 02:29:16,090
an asset and the liability.
The same time you owe yourself the 

3521
02:29:16,090 --> 02:29:16,090
money.
So if I,

3522
02:29:16,090 --> 02:29:18,350
if I buy a government bond,
if I owned the government bond,

3523
02:29:18,470 --> 02:29:22,040
it's an asset to me.
If the government owns its own bond,

3524
02:29:22,070 --> 02:29:23,870
it's not an asset at all.
That makes sense.

3525
02:29:23,871 --> 02:29:28,871
It's a liability and asset sales.
So the trust funds have been a fiction 

3526
02:29:28,871 --> 02:29:33,340
from day one.
I mean Roosevelt sold this to the 

3527
02:29:33,340 --> 02:29:33,340
American public.
It was a con.

3528
02:29:33,340 --> 02:29:35,780
That's why they call it social security 
contributions.

3529
02:29:35,960 --> 02:29:38,750
They call it you're paying premiums.
It's a trust.

3530
02:29:38,900 --> 02:29:41,270
They tried to make it sound like 
legitimate insurance,

3531
02:29:41,390 --> 02:29:46,390
but it was never legitimate insurance 
because that would have actually been 

3532
02:29:46,390 --> 02:29:46,390
unconstitutional.

3533
02:29:46,390 --> 02:29:49,900
The reason that the supreme court said 
social security was constitutional was 

3534
02:29:49,900 --> 02:29:50,210
because it wasn't legitimate.
It was.

3535
02:29:50,211 --> 02:29:55,211
They said it was like.
It was just like any other welfare 

3536
02:29:55,211 --> 02:29:55,211
programs.
Okay.

3537
02:29:55,211 --> 02:29:55,310
We went off on a deep.
Let's wants you to bring back though,

3538
02:29:55,311 --> 02:29:57,410
because we're getting off track.
I really want you to say,

3539
02:29:57,411 --> 02:29:59,540
what would you tell them to do?
Yeah.

3540
02:29:59,570 --> 02:30:02,900
So social security limit entitlements or
eliminate them.

3541
02:30:03,020 --> 02:30:08,020
We've got to,
we've got to start eliminating lots of 

3542
02:30:08,020 --> 02:30:09,770
government agencies and departments.
Whether it's education,

3543
02:30:09,780 --> 02:30:14,780
energy mean they're all,
they're all sorts of government 

3544
02:30:14,780 --> 02:30:17,081
departments that we need to abolish,
we need to cut back on government 

3545
02:30:17,081 --> 02:30:17,081
spending,
we need to economize,

3546
02:30:17,081 --> 02:30:20,360
we need to make government as lean as 
possible because we're broke.

3547
02:30:20,660 --> 02:30:21,650
Government is like,
you know,

3548
02:30:21,770 --> 02:30:26,770
it's like if you're trying to run a 
marathon and you've got a 50 pound sack 

3549
02:30:26,770 --> 02:30:26,770
on your back,
you know,

3550
02:30:26,770 --> 02:30:27,770
you're not going to run very fast.

3551
02:30:27,770 --> 02:30:31,280
The secret is to take some of that 
weight out of the pack.

3552
02:30:31,400 --> 02:30:36,400
So you think that limiting government 
and getting rid of all the spending is 

3553
02:30:36,400 --> 02:30:39,140
going to allow the economy to be more 
powerful.

3554
02:30:39,350 --> 02:30:42,920
But yes,
but initially we know it's like if,

3555
02:30:43,140 --> 02:30:48,140
if,
if you're going to train somebody to 

3556
02:30:48,140 --> 02:30:48,690
come into your gym and they come in and 
they're real fat and they're,

3557
02:30:48,720 --> 02:30:49,110
they're,
they're,

3558
02:30:49,120 --> 02:30:50,050
you know,
they're adequate,

3559
02:30:50,090 --> 02:30:52,160
they're overweight,
they have a lousy diet,

3560
02:30:52,161 --> 02:30:53,210
right?
And you say,

3561
02:30:53,211 --> 02:30:58,211
okay,
I've got a plan for you that's going to 

3562
02:30:58,211 --> 02:30:59,650
get you into shape in the short run.
They're not going to like that plan.

3563
02:30:59,840 --> 02:31:02,510
They can't eat their favorite foods.
They're going to be,

3564
02:31:02,590 --> 02:31:07,590
you know,
getting up early and training and so 

3565
02:31:07,590 --> 02:31:09,940
their lifestyle,
it's not going to be as enjoyable to 

3566
02:31:09,940 --> 02:31:09,940
them.
It's going to.

3567
02:31:09,940 --> 02:31:09,940
There's going to be all this pain,
right?

3568
02:31:10,070 --> 02:31:13,190
So in order to do the right thing,
I'm not saying there's a panacea,

3569
02:31:13,430 --> 02:31:15,740
right?
In order to fix the economy,

3570
02:31:16,160 --> 02:31:18,770
we are going to have to go through a 
recession,

3571
02:31:18,771 --> 02:31:19,980
a very bad one

3572
02:31:19,980 --> 02:31:24,980
in order to reallocate resources to 
where they need to be to let the free 

3573
02:31:24,980 --> 02:31:29,511
market reallocate them.
So when the government gets out of the 

3574
02:31:29,511 --> 02:31:31,911
way and starts shrinking,
a lot of people who were getting 

3575
02:31:31,911 --> 02:31:32,610
government checks are not going to get 
those checks.

3576
02:31:33,060 --> 02:31:36,270
A lot of people who had government jobs 
are not going to have jobs.

3577
02:31:36,360 --> 02:31:39,090
They're going to have to get productive 
jobs in the private sector.

3578
02:31:39,150 --> 02:31:40,710
So there's going to be some transition 
there.

3579
02:31:40,910 --> 02:31:45,910
We're going to also have to get rid of a
lot of regulations that make it so 

3580
02:31:45,910 --> 02:31:47,130
difficult and expensive to hire people 
and train people.

3581
02:31:47,190 --> 02:31:49,650
So we have to downsize government.
And again,

3582
02:31:49,651 --> 02:31:53,190
they said we have to let interest rates 
go up so that people will save.

3583
02:31:53,280 --> 02:31:58,280
So that entrepreneurs can get the 
capital they need to make the 

3584
02:31:58,280 --> 02:31:59,550
investments to make the tools that their
workers need to be more productive.

3585
02:31:59,880 --> 02:32:02,190
But then we have to let asset prices 
fall.

3586
02:32:02,280 --> 02:32:05,280
We have to stop trying to create this 
phony wealth effects.

3587
02:32:05,281 --> 02:32:10,281
Either the central bank thinks what we 
need is to make the stock market go up 

3588
02:32:10,281 --> 02:32:11,520
and then people will think they're rich 
and go out and spend money.

3589
02:32:11,820 --> 02:32:14,250
Stocks are not supposed to be the stock 
price.

3590
02:32:14,251 --> 02:32:16,830
Appreciation is not supposed to be the 
source of wealth.

3591
02:32:17,010 --> 02:32:22,010
It's companies becoming more valuable 
because they're earning more in 

3592
02:32:22,010 --> 02:32:25,681
producing more.
That's supposed to make the price go up 

3593
02:32:25,681 --> 02:32:25,681
there trying to put the cart before the 
horse.

3594
02:32:25,681 --> 02:32:28,860
They think that just making the stock 
market go up is going to make us richer.

3595
02:32:28,900 --> 02:32:29,020
Yeah.

3596
02:32:29,240 --> 02:32:31,230
So in your opinion,
deregulation,

3597
02:32:31,231 --> 02:32:36,231
smaller business,
all these things are going to help 

3598
02:32:36,231 --> 02:32:38,000
letting people know that the god that we
are fucked and that this is this,

3599
02:32:38,120 --> 02:32:43,120
this whole.
The economy's doing great thing is a 

3600
02:32:43,120 --> 02:32:43,120
route.

3601
02:32:43,120 --> 02:32:45,520
Yeah.
And a lot of people who are not working 

3602
02:32:45,520 --> 02:32:45,520
half the start working,
they got to start doing stuff.

3603
02:32:45,520 --> 02:32:46,710
We got to get people off of,
you know,

3604
02:32:46,730 --> 02:32:48,830
the Dole and,
and start and you know,

3605
02:32:48,831 --> 02:32:49,190
they're,
they're,

3606
02:32:49,191 --> 02:32:49,670
they're,
they're,

3607
02:32:49,671 --> 02:32:54,671
they're riding into wagon.
They got to start pulling it like 

3608
02:32:54,671 --> 02:32:54,671
everybody else

3609
02:32:54,671 --> 02:32:55,970
and you think smaller government and 
less regulation is going to enhance

3610
02:32:56,050 --> 02:33:01,050
of course.
Well that's what's keeping them from 

3611
02:33:01,050 --> 02:33:01,050
getting jobs in the first place.
I mean it's,

3612
02:33:01,050 --> 02:33:04,560
you know,
they make it hard for you to get a job 

3613
02:33:04,560 --> 02:33:06,870
with rules and regulations and taxes and
then they reward you for not working 

3614
02:33:06,870 --> 02:33:07,420
with all sorts of subsidies

3615
02:33:07,600 --> 02:33:09,330
programs.
I mean end.

3616
02:33:09,450 --> 02:33:14,050
There's also a fear of automation.
Automation is going to eliminate a large

3617
02:33:14,051 --> 02:33:16,060
amount of jobs including driving jobs.

3618
02:33:16,120 --> 02:33:16,960
Yeah.
But you know,

3619
02:33:17,020 --> 02:33:20,080
that's all gonna make us richer.
I mean we've had automation,

3620
02:33:20,290 --> 02:33:22,150
you know,
since the industrial revolution,

3621
02:33:22,151 --> 02:33:24,610
but even before that there was 
automation.

3622
02:33:24,611 --> 02:33:26,050
I mean,
look at people on the farms,

3623
02:33:26,051 --> 02:33:28,040
look at how many people don't work on 
farms

3624
02:33:28,110 --> 02:33:33,110
now because we have machines,
but people are worried about universal 

3625
02:33:33,110 --> 02:33:34,780
basic income that this is the only 
solution for solution

3626
02:33:34,960 --> 02:33:39,960
automation makes us wealthier as a 
society because it eliminates work.

3627
02:33:41,530 --> 02:33:45,220
Work is not an end in and of itself.
Work is a means to an ends.

3628
02:33:45,310 --> 02:33:48,730
Nobody wants to work,
they want the fruits of the labor and so

3629
02:33:48,731 --> 02:33:51,460
to the extent that we can have a machine
do the work for us,

3630
02:33:51,760 --> 02:33:54,160
that frees us up to do other things.
So you know,

3631
02:33:54,180 --> 02:33:57,820
if we have autonomous cars and I don't 
have to drive anymore,

3632
02:33:58,120 --> 02:34:03,120
you know,
a trump won't have that problem being 

3633
02:34:03,120 --> 02:34:04,390
sued for overtime by his ex driver 
because he won't need somebody to drive.

3634
02:34:04,391 --> 02:34:08,050
But imagine if everybody had a self 
driving car.

3635
02:34:08,140 --> 02:34:10,180
Think of all the free time now that you 
have,

3636
02:34:10,181 --> 02:34:12,130
you can work while you're in your car or
you can,

3637
02:34:12,280 --> 02:34:17,280
you can do other,
you could watch a movie while you're in 

3638
02:34:17,280 --> 02:34:17,280
the car.
I mean you won't be dreading a long trip

3639
02:34:17,280 --> 02:34:18,040
because you'll be to be productive

3640
02:34:18,280 --> 02:34:20,620
while you're in there in that car and 
you know.

3641
02:34:20,621 --> 02:34:22,150
So there's a lot of things that will 
happen.

3642
02:34:22,151 --> 02:34:24,280
Yes,
we'll eliminate truck driver jobs,

3643
02:34:24,760 --> 02:34:25,350
but you know,
we'll,

3644
02:34:25,351 --> 02:34:26,890
we'll have safer streets and,
and,

3645
02:34:26,891 --> 02:34:27,280
and,
and,

3646
02:34:27,520 --> 02:34:29,830
and it'll be less expensive to transport
goods.

3647
02:34:30,040 --> 02:34:35,040
But that frees up that worker to do 
something else with their time now that 

3648
02:34:35,040 --> 02:34:38,740
they don't have the drive that truck.
So the idea of universal basic income is

3649
02:34:38,741 --> 02:34:43,741
the only solution that isn't appealing 
to you because you think that they 

3650
02:34:43,741 --> 02:34:47,160
really.
The real solution is not to give them 

3651
02:34:47,160 --> 02:34:49,441
free money.
The real solution is for them to find 

3652
02:34:49,441 --> 02:34:50,560
something else to do the the physical 
attributes of the appeal.

3653
02:34:50,770 --> 02:34:54,190
The appeal of universal basic income is 
almost like two wrongs make a right.

3654
02:34:54,191 --> 02:34:59,191
I mean the problem is the welfare state 
discourages people from working at the 

3655
02:34:59,321 --> 02:35:04,321
highest marginal tax rate that anybody 
pays is going from welfare to work.

3656
02:35:04,660 --> 02:35:07,540
Because not only do you pay the taxes on
what you earn,

3657
02:35:07,810 --> 02:35:10,660
but you lose all the benefits because 
you now have a job.

3658
02:35:10,840 --> 02:35:15,820
So welfare and the welfare state creates
a huge incentive for people not to work.

3659
02:35:16,090 --> 02:35:18,760
So at least the argument with universal 
income is,

3660
02:35:18,761 --> 02:35:23,761
look,
we're not going to take away your 

3661
02:35:23,761 --> 02:35:23,761
welfare if you get a job.
So if you improve your lot in life,

3662
02:35:23,761 --> 02:35:24,970
if you go out there and you become 
productive,

3663
02:35:24,971 --> 02:35:27,940
we're not going to punish you by,
uh,

3664
02:35:27,990 --> 02:35:29,860
by taking away your welfare.
Well,

3665
02:35:30,010 --> 02:35:33,130
the better answer is let's not punish 
you for working.

3666
02:35:33,280 --> 02:35:36,580
Let's get rid of the income tax.
Let's not tax labor.

3667
02:35:36,581 --> 02:35:39,430
Let's get rid of the payroll tax to make
it more.

3668
02:35:39,431 --> 02:35:42,040
You ever foresee getting rid of the 
income tax?

3669
02:35:42,050 --> 02:35:42,790
We,
this country,

3670
02:35:42,800 --> 02:35:47,800
and yet we didn't have it,
but since the 19 forties when it was 

3671
02:35:48,611 --> 02:35:53,611
introduced in 1913,
but nobody really paid it until 1943 

3672
02:35:53,611 --> 02:35:55,330
when we had the withholding tax.

3673
02:35:55,330 --> 02:35:58,570
But we could get rid of the income tax.
Really think that that would ever fly in

3674
02:35:58,571 --> 02:36:00,240
this country.
I hope so.

3675
02:36:00,241 --> 02:36:02,020
When people are so addicted to that 
money,

3676
02:36:02,500 --> 02:36:03,430
well,
but people don't.

3677
02:36:03,431 --> 02:36:08,431
People don't like paying the income tax,
but we can't get rid of the income tax 

3678
02:36:08,431 --> 02:36:12,181
unless we shrink government.
I mean back in 1900 government was only 

3679
02:36:12,181 --> 02:36:13,240
like five percent of the GNP.
All Levels,

3680
02:36:13,241 --> 02:36:14,230
state,
federal and local.

3681
02:36:14,320 --> 02:36:19,320
Now it's like 40 percent.
So we can't have no income tax and no 

3682
02:36:19,320 --> 02:36:20,980
payroll tax.
If we want to have all this government,

3683
02:36:21,220 --> 02:36:23,080
but if we're willing to do without the 
government,

3684
02:36:23,081 --> 02:36:24,870
then we don't need the taxes.
But if we don't,

3685
02:36:24,890 --> 02:36:27,910
most of this government is ineffective.
Of course.

3686
02:36:27,911 --> 02:36:28,880
I mean government,
you know,

3687
02:36:28,900 --> 02:36:30,420
it's,
it's always inefficient.

3688
02:36:30,430 --> 02:36:34,390
I mean it's a necessary evil,
but that's why you want to minimize.

3689
02:36:34,391 --> 02:36:38,320
So what would you want to keep power?

3690
02:36:38,350 --> 02:36:41,620
Maintaining streets?
Things about maintenance.

3691
02:36:41,680 --> 02:36:43,870
Well,
I know these on a federal level.

3692
02:36:44,300 --> 02:36:49,300
Education,
both the federal government should not 

3693
02:36:49,300 --> 02:36:51,691
be involved in education at all.
And in fact if you look at the 

3694
02:36:51,691 --> 02:36:51,920
constitution to get the word,
education is not mentioned.

3695
02:36:51,990 --> 02:36:56,400
The school is not meant all had buggies 
back then and they were feathers,

3696
02:36:56,410 --> 02:36:58,210
but they had schools.
They knew what they were.

3697
02:36:58,211 --> 02:37:03,211
So what,
so how do you fund education and the 

3698
02:37:03,211 --> 02:37:05,941
department that the Department of 
Education didn't even exist until what 

3699
02:37:05,941 --> 02:37:05,941
we did.
Was it in the sixties?

3700
02:37:05,941 --> 02:37:07,270
I forget when they started it,
but look,

3701
02:37:07,510 --> 02:37:12,510
the federal government should be 
involved primarily with external 

3702
02:37:12,510 --> 02:37:14,410
matters.
So we should have a national defense.

3703
02:37:14,440 --> 02:37:15,920
I think it should much smaller.

3704
02:37:16,070 --> 02:37:19,100
I think that we spend more money than we
need on the military.

3705
02:37:19,280 --> 02:37:22,250
I think we could,
we could have a defensive military for a

3706
02:37:22,251 --> 02:37:27,251
fraction of what we currently pay,
but I think the federal government 

3707
02:37:27,251 --> 02:37:28,760
should be predominantly focused on 
external matters,

3708
02:37:29,250 --> 02:37:34,250
uh,
to the extent that we're going to have 

3709
02:37:34,250 --> 02:37:34,250
public education or government spending 
money on the schools,

3710
02:37:34,250 --> 02:37:35,960
let them do it on a state level or local
level.

3711
02:37:35,961 --> 02:37:36,410
I mean,
no,

3712
02:37:36,470 --> 02:37:39,290
it should not be done at the federal 
level,

3713
02:37:39,380 --> 02:37:44,380
you know,
those are issues that can be the manage 

3714
02:37:44,380 --> 02:37:44,380
by stats,
by the state tax money.

3715
02:37:44,380 --> 02:37:45,040
Yes.
And you know,

3716
02:37:45,380 --> 02:37:49,010
see what happens now is everybody sends 
all this money to the federal government

3717
02:37:49,011 --> 02:37:50,510
and then they beg to get some of it 
back,

3718
02:37:50,511 --> 02:37:52,340
right?
They have state aid where you send money

3719
02:37:52,341 --> 02:37:57,341
out and you try to get some of it back.
Just don't send it to Washington in the 

3720
02:37:57,341 --> 02:37:57,341
first place.

3721
02:37:57,341 --> 02:38:01,030
I mean,
look at the five richest counties in 

3722
02:38:01,030 --> 02:38:01,030
America.
They all surround Washington DC.

3723
02:38:01,030 --> 02:38:02,840
It's all the lobby lobbyists where all 
the power is.

3724
02:38:02,841 --> 02:38:04,220
I mean,
we got to get rid of that.

3725
02:38:04,221 --> 02:38:05,870
I mean,
the federal government is like a cancer,

3726
02:38:06,280 --> 02:38:06,830
you know,
we have,

3727
02:38:06,831 --> 02:38:11,831
we know we now we were talking about,
we got a new nominee for the supreme 

3728
02:38:11,831 --> 02:38:11,831
court.
Talk about,

3729
02:38:11,831 --> 02:38:11,831
you know,
about,

3730
02:38:11,831 --> 02:38:14,630
but nobody really talks about the role 
of the constitution.

3731
02:38:14,631 --> 02:38:15,210
Everybody's like,
oh,

3732
02:38:15,250 --> 02:38:20,250
are we going to repeal roe versus Wade 
is if the most important thing is 

3733
02:38:20,250 --> 02:38:20,510
whether or not,
you know,

3734
02:38:20,511 --> 02:38:22,090
there's this federal,
uh,

3735
02:38:22,340 --> 02:38:27,340
abortion.
The important part of the constitution 

3736
02:38:27,340 --> 02:38:28,550
is that it is the law that applies to 
the government.

3737
02:38:28,910 --> 02:38:33,910
It limits the power of government.
Thomas Jefferson said that we will bind 

3738
02:38:33,910 --> 02:38:38,261
up the con,
the government in the chains of the 

3739
02:38:38,261 --> 02:38:40,511
constitution.
But at this point the government does 

3740
02:38:40,511 --> 02:38:40,511
whatever it wants.

3741
02:38:40,511 --> 02:38:41,990
The government is not abiding by the 
law.

3742
02:38:42,050 --> 02:38:44,900
I mean they try to pretend that we're 
interpreting the constitution.

3743
02:38:45,260 --> 02:38:50,260
It's not up for interpretation.
The constitution is not written in 

3744
02:38:50,260 --> 02:38:50,420
Chinese.
You don't have to interpret it,

3745
02:38:50,480 --> 02:38:55,480
but they,
the government likes to talk about 

3746
02:38:55,480 --> 02:38:55,480
interpreting the constitution because 
they want to ignore it.

3747
02:38:55,480 --> 02:38:59,390
They want to do all sorts of things that
are not authorized by the constitution.

3748
02:38:59,391 --> 02:39:03,770
The constitution only authorizes a few 
powers to the federal government.

3749
02:39:03,771 --> 02:39:08,771
There are enumerated in the constitution
and the Constitution doesn't say the 

3750
02:39:08,771 --> 02:39:08,771
government can do it,
it can't do it,

3751
02:39:08,771 --> 02:39:12,230
and almost everything that government 
does today is unconstitutional,

3752
02:39:12,231 --> 02:39:15,080
is doing so that it has no constantly 
authority to do.

3753
02:39:15,230 --> 02:39:17,360
And that's what we need a supreme court 
for him.

3754
02:39:17,361 --> 02:39:21,020
And a lot of people don't like Congress,
very low opinion of Congress.

3755
02:39:21,130 --> 02:39:22,940
A lot of people don't necessarily like 
the president,

3756
02:39:23,120 --> 02:39:24,770
but everybody loves the judiciary,
right?

3757
02:39:24,770 --> 02:39:26,960
We have three branches of government,
the executive,

3758
02:39:27,230 --> 02:39:30,530
the legislature and the judiciary,
and everybody likes to judiciary,

3759
02:39:30,680 --> 02:39:35,680
but I think it's the judiciary that has 
sold us out the most because they have 

3760
02:39:35,680 --> 02:39:39,071
let the government get away with murder.
They are not enforcing the law on the 

3761
02:39:39,071 --> 02:39:39,930
government and,
and,

3762
02:39:39,940 --> 02:39:42,530
and making the government abide by the 
law.

3763
02:39:42,531 --> 02:39:46,250
I mean the laws that apply to me and you
are up for interpretation,

3764
02:39:46,340 --> 02:39:47,780
you know,
they mean what they say,

3765
02:39:48,080 --> 02:39:53,080
right?
But somehow the laws that apply to the 

3766
02:39:53,080 --> 02:39:53,080
government,
you know,

3767
02:39:53,080 --> 02:39:53,080
will,
they can be interpreted,

3768
02:39:53,080 --> 02:39:53,780
which means they can be ignored,
right?

3769
02:39:53,781 --> 02:39:54,410
They want to say,
oh,

3770
02:39:54,411 --> 02:39:58,010
the constitution is a living,
breathing document so that it can change

3771
02:39:58,011 --> 02:40:00,620
with the times is a way of saying it 
means nothing,

3772
02:40:00,980 --> 02:40:05,980
so we need to reclaim the republic by 
actually forcing the government to live 

3773
02:40:06,350 --> 02:40:08,690
by the constitution.
That's one of the things trump can do is

3774
02:40:08,691 --> 02:40:09,110
say,
look,

3775
02:40:09,350 --> 02:40:13,560
we're going to restore constitutional 
government to this republic.

3776
02:40:13,820 --> 02:40:14,070
We

3777
02:40:14,070 --> 02:40:19,070
are going to make sure that government 
only does what it's authorized to doing 

3778
02:40:19,070 --> 02:40:21,090
the constitution and the smaller you 
make government,

3779
02:40:21,091 --> 02:40:22,580
the freer you make people.
Right?

3780
02:40:22,650 --> 02:40:25,080
That's what it's all about.
I said earlier in the podcast about this

3781
02:40:25,081 --> 02:40:30,081
whole idea about group privileged.
The more privileges that you give 

3782
02:40:30,081 --> 02:40:33,621
groups,
the fewer rights that you have for 

3783
02:40:33,621 --> 02:40:33,621
individuals and the more government you 
have,

3784
02:40:33,621 --> 02:40:38,330
the less free we are,
so that's the actually the real 

3785
02:40:38,330 --> 02:40:40,911
definition of freedom is freedom from 
government and so the smaller 

3786
02:40:40,911 --> 02:40:42,420
government,
the less they regulate your activity,

3787
02:40:42,700 --> 02:40:44,880
the the and the less money they take 
from you,

3788
02:40:44,970 --> 02:40:47,910
the more freedom you have and the more 
free we are,

3789
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:50,370
the more freely we can interact with one
another,

3790
02:40:50,640 --> 02:40:53,070
the more prosperous we're going to be.
Now,

3791
02:40:53,130 --> 02:40:56,670
second step,
what does a person like me do to stop or

3792
02:40:56,671 --> 02:40:58,530
to mitigate the effects of this bubble?

3793
02:40:58,530 --> 02:40:59,880
That's gonna crash.
Well,

3794
02:40:59,940 --> 02:41:00,410
I mean,
as I said,

3795
02:41:00,450 --> 02:41:05,450
the only thing you can do personally 
because politically there's really very 

3796
02:41:05,450 --> 02:41:05,670
little we can do.
I mean it's gonna hit the fan,

3797
02:41:05,700 --> 02:41:10,700
right?
I mean there's nothing we can do about 

3798
02:41:10,700 --> 02:41:10,700
that.
I mean,

3799
02:41:10,700 --> 02:41:13,220
because trump's not going to call me 
down to the White House and they will 

3800
02:41:13,220 --> 02:41:13,220
add to this.
Peter,

3801
02:41:13,700 --> 02:41:18,700
I love on the Joe Rogan podcast even 
though sometimes he touched shit about 

3802
02:41:18,700 --> 02:41:18,700
me,
that little weasel,

3803
02:41:18,700 --> 02:41:23,690
you know I was,
I was his biggest defender after the 

3804
02:41:23,690 --> 02:41:24,070
access Hollywood stuff.
I was on podcast.

3805
02:41:24,071 --> 02:41:29,071
I was,
I defended him when nobody would defend 

3806
02:41:29,071 --> 02:41:31,521
them for that because I understood those
comments and how and what he was doing 

3807
02:41:31,521 --> 02:41:31,880
and I called everybody talking shit.
Yeah,

3808
02:41:31,890 --> 02:41:36,890
he look,
he was just being a guy with other guys 

3809
02:41:36,890 --> 02:41:36,890
and he didn't know he was.
He didn't know he was being.

3810
02:41:36,890 --> 02:41:38,070
He wasn't saying that for public 
consumption.

3811
02:41:38,070 --> 02:41:43,070
Imagine saying something funny and my 
friends have said horrible things to me 

3812
02:41:43,070 --> 02:41:43,070
and I've laughed.
Yes.

3813
02:41:43,070 --> 02:41:45,600
And of course the thing that billy billy
Bush got in trouble for sitting next to.

3814
02:41:45,601 --> 02:41:46,860
I know laughing.
He didn't.

3815
02:41:46,870 --> 02:41:49,200
It wasn't.
He wasn't like taking a stand.

3816
02:41:49,350 --> 02:41:54,350
He's in a broadcast next to a guy who's 
a crazy person who is literally known 

3817
02:41:54,350 --> 02:41:56,520
for being a crazy person saying 
outrageous stuff.

3818
02:41:56,670 --> 02:41:58,830
His tagline is your fire,
you know,

3819
02:41:58,831 --> 02:42:03,831
you know some of the stuff that women 
say about guys when they're just 

3820
02:42:03,831 --> 02:42:03,831
together.
Women chatting.

3821
02:42:03,831 --> 02:42:06,690
I mean it looks so what?
But now I forgot your question about,

3822
02:42:06,800 --> 02:42:07,590
oh,
how do we fix?

3823
02:42:07,620 --> 02:42:09,850
How do we personally me?
Yeah,

3824
02:42:10,310 --> 02:42:11,150
we,
we're not,

3825
02:42:11,580 --> 02:42:16,580
we're not going to prevent it.
What I am hoping like you and people 

3826
02:42:16,580 --> 02:42:20,511
like me after it collapses,
that if we can at least come out there 

3827
02:42:20,511 --> 02:42:22,800
with an alternative version of what 
happened,

3828
02:42:22,801 --> 02:42:24,600
like after the financial crisis 
happened.

3829
02:42:24,900 --> 02:42:27,300
And I was one of the few people saying 
it's not,

3830
02:42:27,610 --> 02:42:29,070
it's.
It wasn't the banks,

3831
02:42:29,071 --> 02:42:31,140
it wasn't greed.
It was government.

3832
02:42:31,141 --> 02:42:33,660
It was the Federal Reserve.
It was Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

3833
02:42:33,720 --> 02:42:37,410
They were the problem right now.
But the government got away with blaming

3834
02:42:37,411 --> 02:42:42,411
capitalism and making government bigger.
What we need to do and what you can do 

3835
02:42:42,411 --> 02:42:43,830
with your audience,
which is much bigger than mine,

3836
02:42:44,220 --> 02:42:49,220
is when it hits the fan again to put the
blame where it belongs on government and

3837
02:42:49,861 --> 02:42:54,861
state government did this to us.
It's not an accident that we have all 

3838
02:42:54,861 --> 02:42:58,221
this government and we have all these 
problems and you know it's government 

3839
02:42:58,221 --> 02:42:58,980
interference in capitalism.
That's the problem,

3840
02:42:59,070 --> 02:43:01,470
not capitalism itself.
If the government stayed out,

3841
02:43:01,471 --> 02:43:06,471
it would be working beautifully,
so we don't want to throw the baby out 

3842
02:43:06,471 --> 02:43:06,600
with the bath water.
We want to preserve the baby,

3843
02:43:06,720 --> 02:43:08,050
the governments,
the bath water.

3844
02:43:08,070 --> 02:43:12,340
So what you can do with your soap box is
get people to understand

3845
02:43:12,490 --> 02:43:14,920
the real source.
Now what you can do now,

3846
02:43:14,921 --> 02:43:19,600
what your audience can do now to protect
themselves so they don't go broke.

3847
02:43:19,750 --> 02:43:22,570
And I think that to the extent that you 
don't go broke,

3848
02:43:23,050 --> 02:43:26,500
you're in a better position to help the 
economy and help the country if you have

3849
02:43:26,501 --> 02:43:27,520
resources,
right?

3850
02:43:27,521 --> 02:43:28,270
If you're.
I said,

3851
02:43:28,271 --> 02:43:30,730
if you know,
if a ship is going to sink and I can get

3852
02:43:30,731 --> 02:43:33,730
you off the ship onto a lifeboat,
then when the ship goes down,

3853
02:43:33,731 --> 02:43:35,590
you might be able to help some of the 
people you know,

3854
02:43:35,650 --> 02:43:38,050
out of the water if you're not drowning 
yourself.

3855
02:43:38,051 --> 02:43:43,051
So what you could do is protect your 
finances if you've got a large 

3856
02:43:43,051 --> 02:43:43,210
portfolio.
Right?

3857
02:43:43,211 --> 02:43:45,940
What I do with my own money and what I 
advise people,

3858
02:43:45,941 --> 02:43:47,770
I manage money at Europe Pacific,
uh,

3859
02:43:47,771 --> 02:43:52,771
asset management at my broker dealer,
years of capital is I invest in 

3860
02:43:52,771 --> 02:43:52,930
countries that,
you know,

3861
02:43:53,090 --> 02:43:55,540
I,
I think are relatively better shape,

3862
02:43:55,570 --> 02:43:58,780
whether it's Switzerland or Singapore,
you know,

3863
02:43:58,840 --> 02:44:00,220
or you know,
New Zealand.

3864
02:44:00,220 --> 02:44:02,360
I mean,
even though New Zealand just left a,

3865
02:44:02,420 --> 02:44:03,920
a leftist,
you know,

3866
02:44:04,110 --> 02:44:09,110
they are calm.
He is strong enough that I think they 

3867
02:44:09,110 --> 02:44:09,110
can withstand it.
They've made enough progress,

3868
02:44:09,110 --> 02:44:13,830
you know,
so there are countries out there that 

3869
02:44:13,830 --> 02:44:13,830
are not nearly as screwed up.
Nobody is perfect.

3870
02:44:13,830 --> 02:44:18,430
Nobody is as good as America used to be.
But there are a lot of countries that 

3871
02:44:18,430 --> 02:44:21,811
are much better than we are now.
And they have assets that you can own 

3872
02:44:21,811 --> 02:44:22,600
that are not in bubbles.
You can get good dividends,

3873
02:44:22,780 --> 02:44:25,870
you can protect yourself from this 
coming stock market crash,

3874
02:44:25,871 --> 02:44:26,920
dollar crash,
bond,

3875
02:44:26,921 --> 02:44:28,870
market crash,
so you can preserve your wealth.

3876
02:44:28,871 --> 02:44:33,871
And as the dollar goes down.
So if you went through the 19 seventies 

3877
02:44:33,871 --> 02:44:37,231
and you had your portfolio,
because the 19 seventies the stock 

3878
02:44:37,231 --> 02:44:37,780
market went way down,
but the dollar went down even more,

3879
02:44:37,781 --> 02:44:39,550
the dollar lost two thirds of its value.

3880
02:44:39,730 --> 02:44:42,610
The reason oil prices went up 10 fold in
the seventies,

3881
02:44:42,730 --> 02:44:47,730
the reason gold went from $35 an ounce 
to 850 was because the dollar collapsed.

3882
02:44:48,340 --> 02:44:53,340
While the dollar is going to have a 
bigger collapse this time than it did 

3883
02:44:53,340 --> 02:44:53,340
last time,
right this time,

3884
02:44:53,340 --> 02:44:55,810
I think the dollar is going to lose its 
status as the reserve currency.

3885
02:44:56,140 --> 02:45:01,140
Last time it didn't lose the status,
it just got marked down because we went 

3886
02:45:01,140 --> 02:45:01,990
off the gold standard,
but it didn't get knocked out.

3887
02:45:01,991 --> 02:45:03,880
I think the next one is gonna be a 
knockout.

3888
02:45:03,881 --> 02:45:06,220
So you got to invest your money outside 
theu ,

3889
02:45:06,350 --> 02:45:11,350
s to preserve your wealth when everybody
else is going broke and you got to own 

3890
02:45:11,350 --> 02:45:12,250
real money,
you got to own gold,

3891
02:45:12,400 --> 02:45:14,140
you own physical gold,
right?

3892
02:45:14,141 --> 02:45:18,010
Which you can buy larger quantities of 
gold through shift goals.

3893
02:45:18,190 --> 02:45:18,790
You know,
I got,

3894
02:45:18,960 --> 02:45:20,140
you know,
very low prices.

3895
02:45:20,140 --> 02:45:22,810
You've got to be careful out there.
There are a lot of companies that'll try

3896
02:45:22,811 --> 02:45:25,300
to bait and switch you into collectible 
coins.

3897
02:45:25,301 --> 02:45:27,490
Rare coins with these huge markups.
Twenty,

3898
02:45:27,491 --> 02:45:28,990
30,
40 percent markups,

3899
02:45:29,080 --> 02:45:31,780
sometimes 100 percent markups.
Stay away from that.

3900
02:45:32,020 --> 02:45:37,020
You know,
you just want to buy bullion and you 

3901
02:45:37,020 --> 02:45:37,020
want to buy it as cheap as you can over 
spot.

3902
02:45:37,020 --> 02:45:41,250
The only time you'd want to pay a little
bit more is to get some jewelry because 

3903
02:45:41,250 --> 02:45:44,641
you want to wear it.
Then it's probably worth it to pay a 

3904
02:45:44,641 --> 02:45:44,641
little extra if you want to,
you know,

3905
02:45:44,641 --> 02:45:47,830
buy something that you can wear it many.
But so you can do that.

3906
02:45:48,190 --> 02:45:50,230
I think the stocks that are going to go 
up the most,

3907
02:45:50,260 --> 02:45:53,950
if you really want to potentially make a
lot of money on this crisis,

3908
02:45:53,951 --> 02:45:58,120
it will be gold stocks.
Gold bullion is not about getting rich.

3909
02:45:58,390 --> 02:46:00,970
It's about staying rich.
It's about not getting poor.

3910
02:46:01,120 --> 02:46:04,240
Buying physical gold is about preserving
the wealth that you have,

3911
02:46:04,600 --> 02:46:07,060
but I think that these gold mining 
companies,

3912
02:46:07,061 --> 02:46:10,040
when the price of gold goes up,
I think some of stocks go up 10,

3913
02:46:10,040 --> 02:46:11,750
20 times or more,
so if you're,

3914
02:46:11,751 --> 02:46:14,210
if you know you can tolerate the risk,
because if I'm wrong,

3915
02:46:14,211 --> 02:46:16,730
you know these stocks would go way down,
but if I'm right,

3916
02:46:16,940 --> 02:46:20,390
they're going to go way up.
So a way that you can really profit from

3917
02:46:20,420 --> 02:46:25,420
what's gonna happen is by having some 
money investing in these coal mining 

3918
02:46:25,420 --> 02:46:28,331
companies and then when we have a dollar
crisis and the price of gold goes way 

3919
02:46:28,331 --> 02:46:28,520
up,
these stocks can go ballistic.

3920
02:46:29,480 --> 02:46:31,280
The Voice of doom and the voice of 
reason.

3921
02:46:31,281 --> 02:46:33,200
All in one man,
Peter Schiff.

3922
02:46:33,201 --> 02:46:35,180
Ladies and gentlemen,
that was awesome,

3923
02:46:35,181 --> 02:46:35,870
man.
Hey,

3924
02:46:35,900 --> 02:46:36,770
how long?
We been talking.

3925
02:46:36,800 --> 02:46:39,020
Three hours.
Three hours already.

3926
02:46:39,600 --> 02:46:43,850
Crazy flies by studios.
Thank you brother.

3927
02:46:43,900 --> 02:46:45,140
Oh,
it's my pleasure.

3928
02:46:45,141 --> 02:46:46,520
Thanks for everything Peter Schiff.

3929
02:46:46,540 --> 02:46:47,020
Folks.
