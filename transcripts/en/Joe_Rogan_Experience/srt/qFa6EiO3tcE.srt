1
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:06,040
Even Arnold came out against Donald Trump,

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,133
right?

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:08,223
Yeah.

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:10,373
Well,

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:14,410
he was married talking
about he was nice with them.

6
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:15,550
That was nice of them.

7
00:00:15,551 --> 00:00:17,140
I gave them to sausage.

8
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,410
Can Trump.

9
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:21,521
He said,

10
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:21,761
dude,

11
00:00:21,761 --> 00:00:22,594
in his voice,

12
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,900
I can no longer stand for
someone I know of a scumbag.

13
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:26,773
Then myself,

14
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:29,920
there's a line people.

15
00:00:29,921 --> 00:00:31,300
He had just crossed it.

16
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:34,270
Okay.

17
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:35,680
John grabbed a pussy.

18
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:37,691
First of all,

19
00:00:37,691 --> 00:00:38,970
a lot of them will let you do.

20
00:00:38,971 --> 00:00:40,060
You just have to ask.

21
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:42,440
Just grabbing pussy left.

22
00:00:42,441 --> 00:00:43,870
Do like grabbing pussy.

23
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,390
You're pro Hillary.

24
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:49,960
Hillary is a good woman.

25
00:00:49,961 --> 00:00:51,550
She's just misunderstood.

26
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:54,910
Sometimes people when they
are around good women,

27
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:57,260
they wind up suiciding themselves.

28
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:04,380
[inaudible] personalities is,

29
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:05,680
it makes you humble.

30
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,450
Governor.

31
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:13,420
That was our governor.
