1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
Jamie bam,
motherfucker,

2
00:00:04,561 --> 00:00:07,260
and we're live with filthy skills by the
way,

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,850
if people wondering what filthy skills 
is,

4
00:00:08,851 --> 00:00:10,980
this is a hilarious story because I just
saw you wearing.

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,070
I ran into you in salt lake.
I didn't know I was.

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,230
I was going to be there by the way.
Cameron Hanes,

7
00:00:16,231 --> 00:00:17,610
my friend,
but winter.

8
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:18,653
Oh my camera here.
Wildlife conservationist to ultra 

9
00:00:21,151 --> 00:00:22,980
marathon runner.
Ultimate Badass.

10
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:23,843
I was.
I'm in Salt Lake skiing with my family 

11
00:00:27,481 --> 00:00:28,314
at the same time.
Was it called the great western is a 

12
00:00:30,631 --> 00:00:35,560
Western hunting exposition.
Conservation Exposition,

13
00:00:35,561 --> 00:00:39,330
something like that.
Which I really want to just drag some of

14
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:40,260
the,
the biggest,

15
00:00:40,261 --> 00:00:45,030
diehard vegans were the most.
The angry ones just let them loose there

16
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,050
and go wander around.
They'd go there,

17
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:51,230
they'd go bonkers.
They'd run into walls and probably,

18
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:52,860
you know,
pee themselves.

19
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:57,090
It's,
it's all just skulls and shit and mounts

20
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:01,860
and the cool stuff and places you can go
to shoot your own food.

21
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,030
But uh,
you were wearing this filthy skill.

22
00:01:04,031 --> 00:01:04,651
Shirts.
I'm like,

23
00:01:04,651 --> 00:01:05,670
what?
What is filthy skills?

24
00:01:05,671 --> 00:01:06,810
And I've been seeing it on your 
instagram.

25
00:01:06,811 --> 00:01:09,390
What is filthy skills?
This is hilarious.

26
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:13,830
So some guy sent you this and we'll put 
it up on the screen so you can see it on

27
00:01:13,831 --> 00:01:15,930
the youtube.
Some guy sent this,

28
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:19,390
which is a a fuck.
This is a photo.

29
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:23,240
The youtube comment with this guy have 
Yada Jamie.

30
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:28,500
Whereas some guy said to you,
here it is.

31
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,700
Fuck you for destroying our world with 
your filthy hunting skill.

32
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:34,423
You're filthy hunting skill.
Why don't you kill yourself instead to 

33
00:01:37,051 --> 00:01:39,510
reduce the population dumb ass.
First of all,

34
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,660
the spelling on this is atrocious.
I.

35
00:01:42,661 --> 00:01:44,970
It's almost like he got his dog to write
that forum.

36
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:47,700
Yeah.
F K space letter.

37
00:01:47,701 --> 00:01:50,370
You space for district got destroying,
right?

38
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:51,323
Yeah.
World,

39
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:52,560
that's a tough word.
Yeah.

40
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,270
He's like,
he's.

41
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:55,050
He's weird.
He's like populations,

42
00:01:55,051 --> 00:01:56,490
good faculties,
good.

43
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:57,600
But your.
He does.

44
00:01:57,601 --> 00:01:59,250
You are people that do.
You are.

45
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:01,550
What do you do with all that extra time 
that you spend,

46
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:03,900
say between like why?
Oh you,

47
00:02:03,901 --> 00:02:05,060
what do you do with,
you know,

48
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:08,430
you don't have to spend that time now 
working those fingers.

49
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,970
Very efficient.
Now you're filthy hunting skills.

50
00:02:11,971 --> 00:02:14,820
So you saw that and were like,
hey,

51
00:02:14,821 --> 00:02:15,654
there's a couple of things I thought I 
did not know I had the power to destroy 

52
00:02:18,601 --> 00:02:19,434
the world.
I am more powerful than I than I ever 

53
00:02:21,301 --> 00:02:22,590
knew.
That's impressive,

54
00:02:22,591 --> 00:02:24,450
isn't it?
I said,

55
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,220
hey,
I have filthy honeys.

56
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,870
I thought that was sort of like a 
compliment,

57
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:30,870
you know?
So it's hence the shirt.

58
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,063
There's a,
there's such a disconnect going on this 

59
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:33,893
world right now.
We were talking about this today while 

60
00:02:34,771 --> 00:02:35,604
we're practicing.

61
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:38,070
It seems like there's some sort of a 
culture war.

62
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,293
There's a movement of people right now,
there's this whole eat what you kill 

63
00:02:43,171 --> 00:02:44,004
movement and a lot of people are 
rejecting the idea of factory farming 

64
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:52,770
and rejecting the idea of a buying 
process.

65
00:02:52,771 --> 00:02:53,604
Food and buying cows that are locked up 
in pens and treated like a commodity 

66
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,260
rather than like a living animal.
Right.

67
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,213
And going out into the woods and hunting
and getting their own food and 

68
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:07,813
connecting to this sort of primal 
existence and self sufficient self 

69
00:03:11,501 --> 00:03:12,670
sufficient.
So what I like about it,

70
00:03:12,671 --> 00:03:13,504
I don't,
I don't rely on anybody to feed my 

71
00:03:15,551 --> 00:03:16,384
family and a lot of people love that,
but then there's this group of people 

72
00:03:20,111 --> 00:03:20,944
that are completely disconnected from 
the way the wild works that are very 

73
00:03:24,551 --> 00:03:25,384
angry about all this.
And so there's some bizarre 

74
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:28,683
conversations I've been having with some
very well meaning very intelligent 

75
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:33,124
people.

76
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:35,090
They're very nice people.
And this is,

77
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:35,943
this is the,
this is where there's a big 

78
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:37,924
misconception here like I got,
I got into it with a gang of people 

79
00:03:40,901 --> 00:03:45,310
recently and I wish you even say I got 
into it because I've kind of given up on

80
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:49,150
insulting people online because I don't 
get anything out of it.

81
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,530
Right?
I get it.

82
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:52,360
If you don't like it,
you don't like me.

83
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:53,800
I get it.
I liked me,

84
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,840
I liked me.
I'm a nice guy.

85
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:56,973
I mean if you meet,
if you meet me and you communicate with 

86
00:03:58,631 --> 00:03:59,320
me,
Nice.

87
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,153
Even if we disagree,
I guarantee we're going to have a 

88
00:04:01,871 --> 00:04:03,730
pleasant conversation.
I'm a nice person,

89
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,320
right?
So when someone insults me or says nasty

90
00:04:08,321 --> 00:04:11,680
shit or it makes a nasty video about me,
I don't watch it.

91
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,200
I'm not going to.
When people want you to respond,

92
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,160
I'm not going to.

93
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,200
Why would I?
I don't have enough time.

94
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,410
I don't know enough time to spend with 
the people I love.

95
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:24,580
I don't have time to hang out with you.
What am I going to have 15 extra minutes

96
00:04:24,581 --> 00:04:25,414
to watch a video and then make my own 
video and I don't have time for this 

97
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,650
world.
This life is short.

98
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:33,340
Okay?
So I get that people are upset,

99
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:34,323
but the core,
the core message that everybody's 

100
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,860
getting out,
there's one of two messages.

101
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:39,694
One message is you should never eat 
animals at all and then we should live 

102
00:04:42,551 --> 00:04:43,384
this idyllic existence where everyone 
lives off nuts and twigs and shit and 

103
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:50,610
vegetables and that's all you eat.
Pine cones.

104
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:51,970
You can.
That's fine.

105
00:04:51,971 --> 00:04:55,330
You can do that.
But then there's the other that use port

106
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,613
and I support that.
The best way to live in this modern 

107
00:04:59,171 --> 00:05:03,250
world is to go out and get your own meat
problem with that.

108
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,020
Of course,
this is a real problem.

109
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,320
Everybody can't do that.
There's not enough wildlife,

110
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,590
there's not enough time and,
and I don't think that we,

111
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,290
we think everybody should do that.
No,

112
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,173
that our point is,
and I think people like us is you don't 

113
00:05:17,861 --> 00:05:19,630
have to do it,
but don't condemn it.

114
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:21,760
Yeah,
don't condemn it because we,

115
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:26,580
I mean as you said in my intro,
conservationist hunters are conservation

116
00:05:26,581 --> 00:05:27,414
is we're the one that's paying the money
for habitat for all these biologists to 

117
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,550
tell us exactly how many animals are out
there.

118
00:05:33,551 --> 00:05:34,384
They got boots on the ground and they're
out there with the animals doing the 

119
00:05:37,001 --> 00:05:41,200
number of surveys.
I'm figuring out harvest harvest numbers

120
00:05:41,201 --> 00:05:42,034
to try to achieve carrying capacity.
The guys online who think that grizzly 

121
00:05:45,821 --> 00:05:49,600
bears are almost extinct and like,
how could you kill a bear?

122
00:05:49,601 --> 00:05:50,434
You know,
they want to kill me because I killed a 

123
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:52,084
bear in Alaska that they probably have 
no clue how many bear running around 

124
00:05:56,471 --> 00:05:58,340
Alaska,
but somehow

125
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,560
they know that I shouldn't have killed 
it.

126
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,833
They don't know how many are there.
They don't know what the bear with the 

127
00:06:03,861 --> 00:06:06,320
bear population,
where I killed two brown bear,

128
00:06:06,321 --> 00:06:10,700
which are grizzly bear and a black bear.
They don't know that those bears need to

129
00:06:10,701 --> 00:06:11,534
be controlled.
Otherwise they decimate the Moose 

130
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,560
population.
It's,

131
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:15,380
it's all about Moose,
everything.

132
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:20,210
And part of that balance is humans.
So people always say,

133
00:06:20,211 --> 00:06:22,490
well,
animals will take care of themselves.

134
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,480
You know,
they've always,

135
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,680
they've always,
you know,

136
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:27,440
it's worked out,
predators kill Blah Blah,

137
00:06:27,441 --> 00:06:29,690
blah.
We're just interfering.

138
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:30,171
Well,
yeah,

139
00:06:30,171 --> 00:06:32,450
we're interfering also because of your 
house,

140
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:35,510
you know,
we're taking habitat so we can't let the

141
00:06:35,511 --> 00:06:38,960
animals sorted out because we're the 
ones encroaching on habitat.

142
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:42,470
So we are in that process.
We are at the top of the food chain.

143
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:44,960
We require habitat to.
They require habitat.

144
00:06:44,961 --> 00:06:47,480
So there's a balance.
It's all part of the equation.

145
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:47,930
It

146
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:50,870
is.
And this balance is,

147
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,733
there's some parts of it that are set in
place before you and I were born and 

148
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:54,914
before a lot of these people that are 
arguing everybody before everybody was 

149
00:06:57,201 --> 00:06:58,034
arguing about this has been born.
The cities were already in place long 

150
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:01,970
time ago.
Um,

151
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,680
the food chain has already been in 
place,

152
00:07:03,681 --> 00:07:04,514
the market chain has been in place as 
far as like getting food to 

153
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:07,634
supermarkets.
Most of the supermarkets that are in 

154
00:07:08,631 --> 00:07:12,920
existence were there long before you and
I started shopping at them and that's,

155
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:15,380
that's a part of this equation of human 
beings.

156
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:16,583
The,
another part of the equation of human 

157
00:07:17,391 --> 00:07:19,400
beings is what you're talking about with
predators.

158
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,353
And this is one of the things that I had
a discussion about what the guys who I 

159
00:07:23,211 --> 00:07:26,300
really like and there's some 
misconception I didn't like these guys,

160
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:29,540
the guys that made that movie cowspiracy
Oh right.

161
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:31,760
They're very good guys.
They're very smart guys.

162
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:32,330
They're,
they're,

163
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:33,163
they're vegans.
They became vegans while factory 

164
00:07:35,361 --> 00:07:36,350
farming.
Well,

165
00:07:36,351 --> 00:07:37,184
it's a lot about factory farming and a 
lot of it is about the amount of waste 

166
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,560
methane,
uh,

167
00:07:42,561 --> 00:07:45,350
that gets into the atmosphere because of
factory farming.

168
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,190
Um,
the,

169
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:48,980
the actual waste as far as their,
their shit,

170
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:52,220
the cows shit.
And what would the amount of devastation

171
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:53,054
that does to our environment and how 
much actual land these animals need to 

172
00:07:57,171 --> 00:08:02,171
graze in order to feed them.
These are really complicated numbers and

173
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:03,343
disputed.
They went with the extreme on one end 

174
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:09,080
and there's some other people I'm having
tomorrow.

175
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:11,480
Doug,
during my friend from Minnesota,

176
00:08:11,481 --> 00:08:13,520
Minnesota,
Wisconsin.

177
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,600
My,
my buddy from,

178
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,270
um,
he's uh,

179
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:22,450
from the Steve Show mediator.
He has that a large a ranch out in,

180
00:08:23,061 --> 00:08:24,130
um,
uh,

181
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,213
what the name of this you hunted out 
there and I'm trying to figure the name 

182
00:08:27,651 --> 00:08:28,510
of the town is.

183
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:30,800
He's a very weird small town.
Anyway,

184
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:35,480
he's in Wisconsin and this really cool 
area where it's the,

185
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:36,710
um,
you know,

186
00:08:36,711 --> 00:08:39,260
they have a,
it's called the driftless area where the

187
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:40,123
glaciers missed,
so it's all hilly and gorgeous and 

188
00:08:42,531 --> 00:08:43,364
beautiful and that's where he lives.
He pays his cows out there and he's 

189
00:08:45,771 --> 00:08:46,604
going to come in and give his 
perspective on a lot of this stuff is 

190
00:08:48,251 --> 00:08:49,330
right.
Um,

191
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,233
but they,
they had this really strange idea about 

192
00:08:53,691 --> 00:08:56,130
wolves and the strength that I had to 
correct them.

193
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,020
And this idea about,
you know,

194
00:08:58,021 --> 00:08:58,854
that we've hunted the wolves to near 
extinction and now the reintroduction p 

195
00:09:01,721 --> 00:09:04,230
and won't haunt them again.
And you really have to stop that.

196
00:09:04,231 --> 00:09:05,220
I'm like,
man,

197
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:06,683
you gotta this is wolves are fucking 
cool and this is one of the things that 

198
00:09:09,931 --> 00:09:12,090
I said these guys,
nobody wants to eliminate wolves,

199
00:09:12,091 --> 00:09:16,650
but throughout human history,
long before we were around,

200
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,520
people have had a problem with wolves 
and there's a reason for that.

201
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,060
All the big bad wolf stories,
all the Little Red Riding Hood,

202
00:09:24,061 --> 00:09:24,894
all that Shit.
It's because wolves are fucking 

203
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:27,810
terrifying.
They are very,

204
00:09:27,811 --> 00:09:28,644
very dangerous and I brought up the 
whole world war one incident with the 

205
00:09:31,201 --> 00:09:32,034
Germans and the Russians had a fucking 
cease fire because so many of them were 

206
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:37,680
getting killed by wolves.
They made an agreement.

207
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:38,693
They're like,
look,

208
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:41,190
obviously we got a real problem that's 
bigger than us,

209
00:09:41,191 --> 00:09:42,024
like 10 people.
Let's stop killing each other for a 

210
00:09:43,411 --> 00:09:46,860
little while and Kelly's fucking wolves,
and they killed the wolves and then went

211
00:09:46,861 --> 00:09:48,750
back to killing each other.
It's a crazy story.

212
00:09:48,751 --> 00:09:49,584
That is.
And then there's the other story from 

213
00:09:50,371 --> 00:09:55,371
the 14 hundreds in Paris were wolves 
killed more than 40 people in Paris.

214
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:59,670
The city of Paris was overrun with 
bulbs.

215
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:03,150
That's insane.
Wolves are killing machines and you have

216
00:10:03,151 --> 00:10:05,640
to keep their populations down and if 
you don't,

217
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:07,290
you run into huge problems.

218
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:08,693
People bring up.
There's this video that people bring up 

219
00:10:10,201 --> 00:10:12,360
all the time.
How wolves changed rivers.

220
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,670
Um,
and it's a fascinating video.

221
00:10:14,671 --> 00:10:15,504
We played it on here before.
The problem with that video is the guy 

222
00:10:19,381 --> 00:10:22,350
who made that video is fucking nuts.
Okay.

223
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,213
And he is a romantic to the extreme and 
the idea of introducing keystone 

224
00:10:27,481 --> 00:10:30,300
predators into these areas where they 
haven't been before.

225
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:31,583
His idea was that wolves are making 
things better for all these other 

226
00:10:34,681 --> 00:10:36,420
animals by getting rid of the,
but they're not.

227
00:10:36,421 --> 00:10:37,254
They're decimating the elk population.
And there was a thing written by 

228
00:10:41,161 --> 00:10:44,940
scientists disputing all of his claims 
that were in that video.

229
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:47,040
So then I want to like,
what's this guy's deal about?

230
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:50,550
So I listened to this NPR podcast on 
him.

231
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,600
This mother fucker wants to bring lions 
back to Europe.

232
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:55,591
He was,
he's like,

233
00:10:55,591 --> 00:10:56,424
there's parts of the UK that are empty 
and we could reintroduce lions and 

234
00:11:00,091 --> 00:11:01,640
hyenas,
but pitcher,

235
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,000
Yada,
Yada,

236
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,250
Yada.

237
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:05,910
A good idea.
I'm to bring you case not that big.

238
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,113
You're going to bring violence like 
actual African lions and his ideas that 

239
00:11:10,021 --> 00:11:10,854
they found these,
these fossils of these lions that 

240
00:11:13,561 --> 00:11:16,020
existed there thousands of years ago,
so then it'd be back.

241
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,650
He wants to reintroduce them.
Well,

242
00:11:17,651 --> 00:11:18,900
people have,
by the way,

243
00:11:18,901 --> 00:11:19,734
this guy was suicidal and depressed,
like to the extreme ready to kill 

244
00:11:23,491 --> 00:11:28,080
himself and then decided to what he 
calls rewilding.

245
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:29,183
He reintroduced himself to the wild,
started experiencing while and fell in 

246
00:11:32,161 --> 00:11:35,730
love with wildlife and nature and that's
what pulled him up out of this.

247
00:11:35,731 --> 00:11:37,910
And now it's his mission.
Hey,

248
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:41,850
I'm in love with wildlife and nature to 
mystically,

249
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,830
but realistically.
Yeah.

250
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:46,350
Well it's.
I do want to say one thing because we've

251
00:11:46,351 --> 00:11:48,720
talked about factory farming and you 
know,

252
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,470
the downside of it.
We're not lumping ranchers,

253
00:11:52,471 --> 00:11:53,770
regular ranchers that

254
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:54,761
raise cattle.
I mean,

255
00:11:54,761 --> 00:11:57,910
my family is a cattle ranching family in
eastern Oregon,

256
00:11:57,911 --> 00:12:00,340
so I'm not talking about,
you know,

257
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:04,690
cows that are out with enough pasture 
out there and then,

258
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,640
and then being killed,
taken mark and kill.

259
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:09,550
We're talking about that.
Animals that don't leave the cage,

260
00:12:09,551 --> 00:12:10,384
that are standing in their own feces and
just never move and never have a life 

261
00:12:14,171 --> 00:12:16,450
and then have a bullet shot through 
their head in their debt.

262
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,090
You know,
we're talking the,

263
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,780
that extreme.
That's not everybody.

264
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:22,920
I have a lot of respect for farmers and 
ranchers and uh,

265
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:23,783
I mean,
so we don't want to lump everybody into 

266
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,260
the ranches.
Are All factory farmers?

267
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,290
No,
they're certainly not.

268
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:29,124
And one of the things that I noticed 
when I was in Montana when I first went 

269
00:12:32,521 --> 00:12:33,354
hunting with Rinella,
we went through the Missouri breaks and 

270
00:12:36,151 --> 00:12:38,550
there was all these cows wandering 
around and I was like,

271
00:12:38,551 --> 00:12:39,750
what is the deal with this?
Well,

272
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:44,470
those cows literally wander free on 
public land they have.

273
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:47,880
And this is what this Oregon nutty shit 
is about.

274
00:12:47,881 --> 00:12:48,714
And within Nevada nutty shit was about 
with all these crazy ranchers that want 

275
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:53,700
to fucking take over the government.
Lincoln.

276
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:55,230
Yeah,
that's not good.

277
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:57,040
But the,
what do they call it?

278
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,080
[inaudible].
That's my favorite by far.

279
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,220
We don't even know.
We never found out who came up with that

280
00:13:02,221 --> 00:13:03,870
description.
Someone was claiming that someone on the

281
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:08,340
podcast came up with that description,
but when we were in Montana,

282
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,433
we.
That's when I first got introduced to 

283
00:13:10,171 --> 00:13:10,940
this.
They,

284
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:11,370
they.

285
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:14,340
These animals are literally roam free 
and wild.

286
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:16,650
They sleep outside,
they eat outside,

287
00:13:16,651 --> 00:13:17,484
they wander through and then they're 
corralled and when they're brought to 

288
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:24,720
slaughter then their corralled and so 
for the majority of their life they live

289
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:27,270
off the land.
Almost like an elk.

290
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:28,990
Yeah,
like a wild animal essentially.

291
00:13:28,991 --> 00:13:30,090
Yeah.
Big Step there.

292
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:34,950
Someone's someone's property.
Some people have a hard time with that.

293
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,480
They have a hard time with the idea of 
property,

294
00:13:36,481 --> 00:13:38,670
of an animal being property and I get 
that too,

295
00:13:38,671 --> 00:13:39,504
man.
Another thing I've watched recently was 

296
00:13:40,621 --> 00:13:44,280
this penn and teller from that.
You ever see that show bullshit?

297
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:46,170
No,
it's a great show.

298
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:51,370
'Em that they used to do on showtime,
but one of them they did was on pita and

299
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:52,403
the Animal Liberation Organization or 
whatever the fuck are heard of that 

300
00:13:56,210 --> 00:14:01,210
foundation for free except Holy Shit,
violent arsonists burning down buildings

301
00:14:02,521 --> 00:14:04,500
was spray painting,
Vegan power and these.

302
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:05,363
I mean just like the nutty as shit,
but they don't think that people should 

303
00:14:08,221 --> 00:14:10,350
have pets.
They don't think,

304
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:11,820
and here's one of the best parts about 
it.

305
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,013
One of the women that was in this 
program who works for Peta was also a 

306
00:14:17,011 --> 00:14:17,844
diabetic.
This is where you got a buckle yourself 

307
00:14:19,771 --> 00:14:22,890
in because there's only one way you get 
that diabetes medicine.

308
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,310
It's from animals,
so it's an animal product,

309
00:14:26,311 --> 00:14:27,144
and so she was saying that she didn't 
think that she was a hypocrite because 

310
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:33,690
that product saves her life so she could
save more animals.

311
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:34,710
Well,
guess what?

312
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:36,420
Fuck face.
That's what hunting is.

313
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:38,700
Exactly.
That sort of hunting is exactly.

314
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:39,830
I mean if you,
if you go out,

315
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,180
you hunt a wolf and I'm not,
I'm not into hunting wolves,

316
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:44,380
but if they have to control their 
population like that,

317
00:14:44,381 --> 00:14:45,151
not in a hunting,
anything.

318
00:14:45,151 --> 00:14:47,010
I don't meet somebody.
Somebody is got to kill them.

319
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:50,240
Somebody's got to do it and they're 
doing it by the way there.

320
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,070
And also,
here's another thing about

321
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:52,903
California,
California mountain lions are a giant 

322
00:14:55,431 --> 00:14:56,264
issue.
There's an article that I posted up 

323
00:14:57,141 --> 00:14:58,400
recently.
Pull it up,

324
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,390
Jamie,
that someone.

325
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,433
Someone sent me yesterday,
they did this like you cannot hunt 

326
00:15:03,651 --> 00:15:07,410
mountain lions in California.
There's a reason for it is not here.

327
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:08,263
It's not logical.
It's all based on people who are animal 

328
00:15:11,121 --> 00:15:14,090
lovers who got into a position of power 
or voted this in.

329
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:15,403
Well,
there's the study they're finding 

330
00:15:16,551 --> 00:15:17,384
because they killed these mountain lions
when they start moving into 

331
00:15:19,191 --> 00:15:21,780
neighborhoods and killing pets and it's 
super common.

332
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,633
They've killed.
What's the number of mountain lions 

333
00:15:23,781 --> 00:15:26,180
they've killed this year because it's.
It's crazy.

334
00:15:26,181 --> 00:15:27,014
Okay.
Here with a 170 107 mountain lions were 

335
00:15:29,781 --> 00:15:32,360
killed last year legally by the 
government,

336
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,630
so that's 107 mountain lions and people 
didn't get tagged for,

337
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:38,900
which means that's money that didn't go 
into the state coffers.

338
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:40,670
Then it didn't go to conservation.

339
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,780
It's just money.
It's.

340
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,970
It works.
The opposite state is paying.

341
00:15:43,971 --> 00:15:44,800
Exactly.
Yeah.

342
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,810
State is paying for going into the hole.
They're going in the hole.

343
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,793
Instead of going into the profit margin,
which would they normally did in the 

344
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,300
black and red.
I'm colorblind matter.

345
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:00,170
So they analyze these mountain lions and
they found it.

346
00:16:00,171 --> 00:16:02,410
Mostly what they're eating is pets.
They're.

347
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:06,020
They're eating fucking.
Only five percent had eaten deer.

348
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:06,681
Right?
Well,

349
00:16:06,681 --> 00:16:08,330
they're going to go with the easiest 
target.

350
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:09,680
Yeah,
but that seems sane.

351
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:11,420
Only five.
Granted,

352
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,300
a lot of these animals,
they're there.

353
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,170
They're killing their already problem 
animals.

354
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,213
Well,
in what happens with lions are so 

355
00:16:17,691 --> 00:16:18,524
territorial,
so the younger lions come up and the 

356
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,213
more dominant lions have their area,
so the younger ones are forced to go 

357
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:28,370
somewhere else.
They can't really cross.

358
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:29,383
So they go somewhere else.
What's left is cities and neighborhoods 

359
00:16:32,061 --> 00:16:34,160
and residential and that's where the 
pets are.

360
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:34,993
So I mean those are probably juvenile 
lions mostly and down in there and it's 

361
00:16:39,441 --> 00:16:43,580
just a matter of time before a little 
kid gets snatched or whatever and people

362
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,830
don't want to talk about that or think 
about that.

363
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:48,620
But that's the reality of it.
They're just predators.

364
00:16:48,621 --> 00:16:49,454
They're killers.
They're going for the easiest target 

365
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:53,090
right now.
That's a dogs and cats,

366
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,480
but they don't care.
They don't care.

367
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,333
They're not hugging each other and 
crying like we've seen billboards of 

368
00:16:58,221 --> 00:16:59,054
that either.
We're going to get into that in a 

369
00:16:59,841 --> 00:17:00,674
moment,
but I think this is what I'm trying to 

370
00:17:03,021 --> 00:17:04,110
get at.
Um,

371
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:08,960
this is where I think there's a dispute 
and a misconception in the misconception

372
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:09,794
is that hunters are all these evil 
people that want to hunt these animals 

373
00:17:12,591 --> 00:17:14,450
to kill them so they can put them on 
their wall.

374
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:16,283
Almost all of the money that goes to 
fish and game fish and wildlife 

375
00:17:20,721 --> 00:17:24,110
management organizations that protect 
wetlands,

376
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:28,870
that protect public lands for,
for camping and for,

377
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:29,733
for people to use and people to enjoy 
and go hike the money to support those 

378
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,850
comes from hunting.
Yeah.

379
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,430
People hate that.
They hate it.

380
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:40,190
But by far,
by far,

381
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,113
the amount of money that comes from 
conservation comes from hunting by far 

382
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:48,110
for the amount of money goes for 
conservation,

383
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,680
for the animals,
for the animals,

384
00:17:49,681 --> 00:17:50,250
for habitat

385
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,460
restoration.
You know,

386
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,120
that show we were just at in Utah,
um,

387
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,310
they had a mule deer tag that was 
auctioned off.

388
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,860
They give for an antelope island tagged.
They give two tags.

389
00:17:58,861 --> 00:18:02,010
One is in the drawing,
so you have very small chance of getting

390
00:18:02,011 --> 00:18:04,380
it because there's huge bucks.
Whereas antelope island,

391
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,480
I don't know,
Utah,

392
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:09,660
I'm not sure exactly where it is.
There isn't an actual island.

393
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:10,883
I don't know.
I don't know if it's just a place they 

394
00:18:11,971 --> 00:18:14,130
call antelope island or if it's an 
actual island.

395
00:18:14,131 --> 00:18:17,050
Jamiel find out he is a state park.
Yeah,

396
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:18,090
it's,
I knew it was a park,

397
00:18:18,091 --> 00:18:19,830
but I didn't know if it's an actual 
island or not.

398
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,650
Um,
uh,

399
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,450
but anyway,
so one is a drawing.

400
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:25,560
There it is.
So it's,

401
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,080
is that the Great Salt Lake there?
Yeah.

402
00:18:28,081 --> 00:18:28,914
So it's a,
you see that as set out into the great 

403
00:18:31,591 --> 00:18:32,424
salt lake and it's not,
it's not a detached island or doesn't 

404
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:36,240
look like it was just a long peninsula.

405
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,093
Yeah.
So it's a peninsula they call antelope 

406
00:18:38,461 --> 00:18:39,294
island and that's,
there's huge bucks and I think they're 

407
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:42,060
sheep.
They're also.

408
00:18:42,061 --> 00:18:44,850
But the bucks are what draw the draw the
money.

409
00:18:44,851 --> 00:18:45,684
So they auctioned one off and it went 
for $410,000 for one deer tag and that 

410
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,633
most of that money,
90 percent 10 percent goes to a to 

411
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,130
funding the auction and doing all the 
things that's required there.

412
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,143
Ninety percent of that 400,
$10,000 goes right to habitat 

413
00:19:03,001 --> 00:19:08,001
restoration on the island.
I'm building a water water sources,

414
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:09,503
enhancing those re relocating animals 
off that peninsula there because the 

415
00:19:13,891 --> 00:19:14,724
genetics,
our genetics are so good to and the 

416
00:19:16,141 --> 00:19:16,974
bucks are big and the sheep are big,
so they're really relocate those 

417
00:19:20,641 --> 00:19:21,474
superior genetics throughout Utah.
So then you might not draw that tag or 

418
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:28,560
you might not have $410,000,
but those genetics are spread throughout

419
00:19:28,561 --> 00:19:30,960
Utah.
So they're spread in areas where general

420
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:33,560
hunters have the access to.
And uh,

421
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:35,100
it's just,
it's all positive.

422
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,250
It's all positive for the state park.
And you know,

423
00:19:38,251 --> 00:19:40,080
anti hunters will say,
well,

424
00:19:40,081 --> 00:19:42,360
if you really cared about the animals,
you just,

425
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,070
you know,
do the 400,

426
00:19:44,071 --> 00:19:46,080
$10,000 and not go hunting.
Well,

427
00:19:46,081 --> 00:19:48,960
it is true.
What is it an anti hunter do that?

428
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:50,350
Well,
here's,

429
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,540
here's a part of the problem.
There's a,

430
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:55,180
there's a bunch of problems with,
with all these discussions.

431
00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:00,240
And a big part of it is that the people 
that are arguing against the hunting,

432
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:01,250
they,
they,

433
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:05,140
they don't regularly go into the wild,
into these habitats,

434
00:20:05,141 --> 00:20:09,250
in these environments and see how 
brutally hard they are for these animals

435
00:20:09,251 --> 00:20:10,084
to survive anyway.
It's not like if you kill a buck that 

436
00:20:13,061 --> 00:20:13,894
buck live to be five years old,
you might be taking a year off it's 

437
00:20:18,011 --> 00:20:18,920
life.
That's right.

438
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,093
No,
there's,

439
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:23,740
there's no.
There's no 100 year old deer out there.

440
00:20:23,741 --> 00:20:26,050
That was the long,
long great life.

441
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:26,943
And this is the idea of one of the parts
of hunting that actually aids in 

442
00:20:30,431 --> 00:20:34,930
conservation is when you get a mature 
buck and you harvest that mature buck,

443
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:36,123
you are allowing the younger deer to 
breed where they might not have gotten 

444
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:41,560
the opportunity.
And you're also in a lot of cases,

445
00:20:41,561 --> 00:20:45,820
saving their lives because they get 
killed and fights with older deer,

446
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,010
like a lot of die

447
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,440
from fights.
People find them all the time.

448
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:51,483
They literally stab each other to death.
They don't have those antlers to look 

449
00:20:54,011 --> 00:20:54,844
cool.
No,

450
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:57,160
they don't have those therapists.
They slam into each other.

451
00:20:57,161 --> 00:20:58,510
That's what they do.
Same with elk.

452
00:20:58,570 --> 00:20:59,321
Yeah.
Same with elk.

453
00:20:59,321 --> 00:21:03,070
I mean when you and I were in Colorado 
was one of the coolest fucking things we

454
00:21:03,071 --> 00:21:03,904
saw is when.
Remember when we went down in near that 

455
00:21:05,591 --> 00:21:06,424
little creek area when there was,
there was like a huge herd of 20 elk 

456
00:21:09,131 --> 00:21:12,580
together and those elk were duking it 
out and slamming into each other.

457
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:14,140
Oh,
that sounds amazing.

458
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,033
Well,
here's another thing that I don't think 

459
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,700
antennas realize.
You know,

460
00:21:18,701 --> 00:21:22,840
you go out for an extended period and 
the killing,

461
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:25,330
the actual killing is such a small part 
of the hunt,

462
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:27,460
you know?
I mean it's those experiences.

463
00:21:27,461 --> 00:21:29,710
Like when we saw those bulls fighting 
and we saw,

464
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:30,723
I think there were seven bowls and 
there's one nice bowl at 3:50 class 

465
00:21:33,851 --> 00:21:34,030
bowl.

466
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:34,863
He was a herd bull,
but their satellite bowls spread 

467
00:21:36,971 --> 00:21:38,230
throughout on the APP.
He's,

468
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:41,830
he kept him pushed out and they were 
jostling around and we were there.

469
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:46,960
We didn't kill anything,
but the experience of that night was one

470
00:21:46,961 --> 00:21:47,794
I'll never forget.
We had a bull sneak in behind us to 15 

471
00:21:50,381 --> 00:21:51,214
yards and a nice bowl.
A bowl that would have been a great 

472
00:21:53,981 --> 00:21:55,990
bullet for you to kill and it didn't 
happen,

473
00:21:55,991 --> 00:21:58,960
but it was just like the adrenaline of 
that experience.

474
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:01,690
I mean,
he was right there behind the bush.

475
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:02,800
I mean,
right there.

476
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:06,340
So close screaming,
but nothing died.

477
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,260
No it.
But we are predators.

478
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:11,620
We were predators.
They were prey and that's,

479
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:14,170
that's life.
That's life in the mountains,

480
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,640
right?
That's how it works.

481
00:22:15,641 --> 00:22:16,474
Even if we didn't have a bow,
even if we weren't there to kill 

482
00:22:18,611 --> 00:22:20,200
anything,
if we just had calls,

483
00:22:20,201 --> 00:22:23,160
so we were just calling them in,
it would have been an amazing experience

484
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:28,500
because when you were there with 
essentially as wild and animal as you're

485
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:29,790
ever going to get.

486
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:33,550
I mean North American elk is a 1000 
pound,

487
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:34,563
gigantic wild animal with a tree growing
out of its head and it's living the way 

488
00:22:39,131 --> 00:22:41,860
it's lived for thousands of years and 
you know,

489
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:44,860
you as a person who lives in Oregon and 
me as a person who lives in California,

490
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:48,970
we travel into their land.
We we hike in to where they're at and we

491
00:22:48,971 --> 00:22:53,971
experience this wild existence that they
live in and we don't want to stop that.

492
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:57,220
We're not trying to kill them off.
We want more of them.

493
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,520
We the NS is the idea of killing a 
mature one.

494
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:01,663
Would you want to take out an animal 
that does not have much time left and 

495
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,090
you help the rest of the animals survive
because of that.

496
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:10,993
You,
you make it so that the younger bulls 

497
00:23:12,431 --> 00:23:15,900
have a chance to thrive and breed.
Otherwise they're pushing out.

498
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:18,090
They're pushed out and they're not doing
anything and,

499
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,330
but,
but I will say one thing.

500
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:22,300
So you said even if we wouldn't have had
weapons,

501
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:25,870
it was still had been been amazing,
but to me it would have been different.

502
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,913
Yes,
it would have been different because if 

503
00:23:28,211 --> 00:23:32,590
I'm just an observer internally,
I feel a lot different.

504
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:35,620
I only,
I feel like I'm a Predator when I have a

505
00:23:35,621 --> 00:23:38,470
weapon,
so I don't know if I could,

506
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:41,890
if I would have worked as hard,
if I would have cared as much if we were

507
00:23:41,891 --> 00:23:44,770
just observing,
you know what I mean?

508
00:23:44,771 --> 00:23:47,330
Because if you remember that we snuck 
down,

509
00:23:47,331 --> 00:23:49,640
we're sneaking or I mean we're on our 
butts,

510
00:23:49,641 --> 00:23:53,570
kind of scooting down in the two bowls,
were jostling around right there,

511
00:23:53,571 --> 00:23:54,404
kind of sparring a little bit and we had
a small window through the brush and I 

512
00:23:57,711 --> 00:23:59,000
was like,
you are right,

513
00:23:59,001 --> 00:24:00,440
right here.
As looking at Mike,

514
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:02,510
I said,
can you see that window?

515
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:04,490
Do you see that window?
We can get that Arrow through.

516
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,030
It was just that in the intensity of 
that moment.

517
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:10,400
So you're a predator,
that's your pray.

518
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:13,250
How can you ethically kill it?
That's alert.

519
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:16,010
All the all it comes down to.
I mean that's why we're there.

520
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:17,480
To me,
that's everything.

521
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:19,580
You know,
it says that crunch time moment.

522
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:20,563
Well there's one of the most ridiculous 
things that you see when I look at your 

523
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:23,594
instagram or even my instagram,
if I rarely post a picture of a data 

524
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:28,424
animal just because of that.
I'll post fish all day long and nobody 

525
00:24:30,591 --> 00:24:32,960
gives a shit.
Nobody gives a fuck about fish.

526
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:34,970
It's hilarious.
It's hilarious.

527
00:24:34,971 --> 00:24:36,080
The,
the hierarchy,

528
00:24:36,081 --> 00:24:37,610
we'll fish.
They're not alive.

529
00:24:37,611 --> 00:24:39,020
Are they?
Here they are.

530
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:40,700
I believe they are.
But,

531
00:24:40,701 --> 00:24:41,534
um,
if you post a picture of an elk or God 

532
00:24:43,161 --> 00:24:46,550
forbid a bear,
people lose their fucking minds.

533
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:49,700
And one of the things that people love 
to say is if it's an original thought,

534
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:52,310
it's one of those things that did not.
They usually say,

535
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:53,990
yeah,
you're such a big moon.

536
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:59,080
How about you do that without a weapon?
I love that without what hunter has ever

537
00:24:59,811 --> 00:25:04,160
killed anything in the history of MMA.
That's what hunters are.

538
00:25:04,161 --> 00:25:05,960
Shit,
tell me a hunter.

539
00:25:05,961 --> 00:25:09,800
Even a caveman that ever killed without 
a weapon of some sort.

540
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:13,220
What are they talking about?
They're not talking about anything.

541
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,620
They're just talking.
They're just trying to demean you.

542
00:25:15,621 --> 00:25:18,590
And I go to their fucking page and one 
of them,

543
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,590
uh,
this guy was feeding his animals meet.

544
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,720
And I'm like,
that shit come from a meat tree.

545
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:26,030
He's like,
this guy was shitting all over you.

546
00:25:26,031 --> 00:25:28,100
And then I go to his page,
he's got dogs,

547
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,000
he's got dogs.
And he's feeding them me.

548
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,340
I'm like,
Oh man,

549
00:25:31,341 --> 00:25:34,070
there's some fucking convenient thinking
going on here.

550
00:25:34,071 --> 00:25:34,904
It's,
it's so strange how many people have 

551
00:25:36,531 --> 00:25:39,500
these convenient patterns of thought 
where they're self righteous.

552
00:25:39,501 --> 00:25:41,420
They take the moral high ground,
not look,

553
00:25:41,421 --> 00:25:42,254
I the only person that has any say,
the only person that has a leg to stand 

554
00:25:45,951 --> 00:25:48,500
on is a person who's a Vegan who doesn't
eat any,

555
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,630
any animal products,
any animal products,

556
00:25:50,631 --> 00:25:51,464
okay.
That's a small percentage of the 

557
00:25:52,161 --> 00:25:52,994
population,
but if they want to criticize it there 

558
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:58,580
and they have an argument,
they have a very small leg to stand on.

559
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:00,650
Holy ground.
When you have a conversation with them,

560
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:03,110
that's when that argument kind of falls 
apart.

561
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,470
It does because,
okay,

562
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:05,990
v,
if they're hardcore Vegan,

563
00:26:05,991 --> 00:26:06,824
fine,
but are they growing their own 

564
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:11,330
vegetables?
Very few because if they're not,

565
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:13,760
they still are responsible for animals 
dying.

566
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:14,893
If you've ever driven by,
if you've ever been into farmland and 

567
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:24,880
say a field has been harvested once the 
field is harvested,

568
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:27,770
you'll notice buzzards flying around 
that field.

569
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:28,603
You know why?
Because there's a bunch of dead animals 

570
00:26:30,081 --> 00:26:30,914
out there.
There's rabbits that were killed during 

571
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:33,440
the harvest.
There's mice,

572
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:38,460
there's all so fonds.
What it is a big problem with grouse,

573
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:40,580
whatever.
I mean those,

574
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:41,463
you know,
the combines or whatever they're using 

575
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:47,550
there is just tearing everything up and 
think animals are dying so you can,

576
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:49,860
unless you're growing your own 
vegetables,

577
00:26:49,861 --> 00:26:54,090
unless you're doing it yourself Vegan,
you're responsible for animals dying.

578
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:56,940
If your house isn't made of wood because
it's made of wood,

579
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:59,310
there's timber harvest it.
And when that timber was harvested,

580
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:01,020
animals die.
So I mean,

581
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,800
well they're also their habitats 
displays.

582
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:06,630
So people,
well I think with their ideas,

583
00:27:06,631 --> 00:27:08,780
they want to do the least harm possible.
Okay.

584
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:12,810
But a lot of them already came from a 
background where they eat meat.

585
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:16,170
Like I had this one guy was fucking 
arguing with me wanting to argue with me

586
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,550
and giving me all this grief.

587
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:20,970
And then he admits that he was a 
mediator just seven months ago.

588
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:23,470
It's been a Vegan for seven months.
He's fucking 40.

589
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:29,400
So for 39 years and three months,
this motherfucker,

590
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:32,940
five months,
whatever it was is my math.

591
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,870
So this guy for all these were very 
quick though.

592
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,410
Your math is very quick,
but my point is Sarah dead hunter.

593
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:41,041
Come on,
man.

594
00:27:41,041 --> 00:27:44,100
You can't see that seven months ago you 
were a fucking Vegan and you're shitting

595
00:27:44,101 --> 00:27:44,934
out are you were you were a mediator.
You're shitting all over these people 

596
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,100
saying it's a.
it's a moral high ground.

597
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:52,980
They elevate themselves.
There are a bunch of the red.

598
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,380
They're above us because we're redneck 
hunters.

599
00:27:55,381 --> 00:27:56,490
Right?
Same thing.

600
00:27:56,491 --> 00:27:57,324
I had this kid,
he looked like he was maybe younger 

601
00:27:58,951 --> 00:28:00,390
twenties,
but he's,

602
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:01,453
I mean he's a very passionate about his 
stance on what's right and what's wrong 

603
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:07,620
and so I went to his page,
same as you.

604
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:10,400
I see a bunch of hot dogs on there and I
was like,

605
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,390
dude,
enjoy those hot dogs,

606
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:16,110
but before you judge me or condemn me,
why don't you live a little,

607
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:17,123
you're 20 years old,
what the hell do you know about 

608
00:28:19,201 --> 00:28:20,034
anything?
And all of a sudden you know what's 

609
00:28:21,301 --> 00:28:22,860
right and wrong,
and he's like,

610
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:23,993
he says,
I'm going to have an answer for this or 

611
00:28:25,951 --> 00:28:27,900
Karma or some crazy thing.
I'm like,

612
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,660
what do you know?
You haven't even lived yet?

613
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:31,903
Well,
not only that,

614
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:35,370
hot dogs are probably the worst.
It is one of the worst.

615
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,630
I mean that is ground assholes and cow 
digs.

616
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,213
The probably one of the worst things you
could fucking eat too filled with 

617
00:28:42,541 --> 00:28:45,810
nitrites and nitrates and whatever's bad
for you.

618
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:50,220
I understand that they're trying to work
it out for themselves and working it out

619
00:28:50,221 --> 00:28:51,054
for themselves.
A lot of times people want to condemn 

620
00:28:52,141 --> 00:28:54,480
people that are living a lifestyle 
that's outside of their.

621
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,070
They decide,
hey,

622
00:28:56,071 --> 00:28:56,904
I'm going to live this small carbon 
footprint lifestyle where I'm going to 

623
00:28:59,341 --> 00:29:02,730
be humane and ethical and I'm going to 
be cruelty free,

624
00:29:02,731 --> 00:29:04,980
Hashtag cruelty free and I'm going to go
on it.

625
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:05,863
That's like Hashtag cruelty free.
It's like they want to tell you half of 

626
00:29:09,121 --> 00:29:12,390
them have fucking Vegan and their names,
which is hilarious of Vegan.

627
00:29:12,391 --> 00:29:13,680
This Vegan,
that healthy,

628
00:29:13,681 --> 00:29:17,820
happy Vegan fucking Vegan flowerchild 
everyone's.

629
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:20,570
But it's a part of their name.
Like it's,

630
00:29:20,571 --> 00:29:23,010
it's a big part of their identity and it
becomes,

631
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:26,250
it becomes like a cult and I don't mean 
it like,

632
00:29:26,251 --> 00:29:27,084
you know,
you have to fucking initiation and pay 

633
00:29:27,971 --> 00:29:28,804
dues,
but I mean it's like you're a part of a 

634
00:29:29,671 --> 00:29:32,460
gang and it's.
People have a tendency to do that.

635
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,200
Good or bad.
They have a tendency.

636
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:37,080
Hunters have a tendency to do it.
People will fucking use windows,

637
00:29:37,081 --> 00:29:39,380
have a tendency to do it,
but I don't like apple.

638
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,190
One fucking windows and apple.
You're a piece of shit.

639
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:43,603
But.
But hunters don't have the hate that 

640
00:29:44,651 --> 00:29:47,230
these anti hunting vegans have.
They don't,

641
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:48,041
they don't.
I mean,

642
00:29:48,041 --> 00:29:53,041
hunters don't go to their pages and who 
cares?

643
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,550
Live your life.
Yeah,

644
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,513
know I get where their thought process.
They think they're doing the right 

645
00:29:59,861 --> 00:30:02,170
thing,
doing the right thing and there's a lot.

646
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:03,183
This is not another thing I want to 
point out and I went on this twitter 

647
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,110
page,
a discussion the other day.

648
00:30:08,111 --> 00:30:11,410
I went on this rant.
I don't hate vegans have vegans that are

649
00:30:11,411 --> 00:30:12,530
friends.
It's not as.

650
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:15,130
I don't know.
I'm not lumping everybody in.

651
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:16,123
You know this.
There's a small percentage of people 

652
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:22,441
that are assholes that are arrogant and 
outspoken and really aggressive and mean

653
00:30:23,081 --> 00:30:25,180
and shitting,
and where's the cruelty free.

654
00:30:25,181 --> 00:30:26,014
They're like,
why are you being cruel to other people 

655
00:30:27,641 --> 00:30:29,830
that are like,
look around with tolerance.

656
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:34,860
Go outside and drive for 20 minutes and 
I guarantee you you're going to pass 30,

657
00:30:34,961 --> 00:30:36,910
40 places that have dead animals in 
them.

658
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:41,200
Every fucking supermarket you pass by 
every fast food place,

659
00:30:41,201 --> 00:30:43,810
every restaurant,
every gas station that's slim.

660
00:30:43,811 --> 00:30:46,700
Jim's at the fucking counter or all of 
that is animal.

661
00:30:46,701 --> 00:30:48,100
So you.
For you to find a hunter,

662
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:49,083
the one person that you could point to 
that probably kills animals in the most 

663
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:57,840
ethical and humane way possible and 
contribute and pastries to be,

664
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,080
to play part of the conservation.
Rolling.

665
00:31:00,081 --> 00:31:00,940
Yeah.
You know,

666
00:31:00,941 --> 00:31:02,580
and people hear these podcasts,
oh,

667
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:04,600
you fucking go to justify what you're 
doing.

668
00:31:04,601 --> 00:31:06,550
If you have to justify it,
there's something wrong.

669
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:09,250
No,
it's the arguments or tiresome.

670
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,990
There's a guy that's coming on next 
week,

671
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:11,830
his name is,
uh,

672
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:13,060
how do you say his name?
Tovar.

673
00:31:13,061 --> 00:31:15,480
How do you.
So really to Varsa ruling there.

674
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,360
That's,
that sounds so really,

675
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:20,680
he's an author and a guy that used to be
a Vegan who's not a hunter.

676
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:23,230
Right.
And panties will be bunched.

677
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:26,770
They will get sandy and tweets will be 
tweeted.

678
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,300
Good.
It's gonna get crazy,

679
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:29,253
but I,
I just think that podcast like this and 

680
00:31:32,051 --> 00:31:35,380
conversations like this with a guy like 
you,

681
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:37,360
like I think what you do is the best way
to do it.

682
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:38,830
I mean,
I've said this time and time again,

683
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:41,770
what you do is the best way to do it 
because what you're doing,

684
00:31:41,771 --> 00:31:43,660
first of all,
it's the most difficult way to do it and

685
00:31:43,661 --> 00:31:46,590
you prepare your body for it in a very 
fucking grueling fashion.

686
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:47,463
We worked out before we got here and you
work out every day and one of the 

687
00:31:50,111 --> 00:31:52,870
reasons why you work out every day,
it's fucking going through the mountains

688
00:31:52,871 --> 00:31:53,950
is hard as shit.

689
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:55,150
It is.
It is hard,

690
00:31:55,151 --> 00:31:55,984
man.
I never knew until I went with Rinella 

691
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:00,520
the first time we went up to the 
Missouri breaks.

692
00:32:00,521 --> 00:32:02,230
We're climbing the mountains for seven 
hours a day.

693
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:03,430
I was like,
oh,

694
00:32:03,431 --> 00:32:05,110
okay.
This is fucking.

695
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:08,230
This is not going to the gym and getting
on the elliptical machine.

696
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:11,680
This is fucking constant and it's all 
day and if you're packing shit,

697
00:32:11,681 --> 00:32:14,130
you have to be strong.
You have to be physically strong to do.

698
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:14,973
I mean,
you remember in Colorado and we were 

699
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:17,363
roughing it up that Ridge.
You know we're at the bottom of the 

700
00:32:18,671 --> 00:32:19,504
canyon.
Heard a bull bugling is the bull you 

701
00:32:21,341 --> 00:32:22,150
killed?
Yeah.

702
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:23,950
This dude takes off like a fucking 
mountain goat.

703
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:27,010
I'm in pretty God damn good shape.
And I'm like.

704
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:31,450
And he's like,
don't even breathe in as fuck.

705
00:32:31,451 --> 00:32:32,284
He gets to the top of the bat.
That's how you saw the bowl is at the 

706
00:32:34,301 --> 00:32:35,134
top of the mountain that you spotted it,
but know that that the sun was going 

707
00:32:37,331 --> 00:32:38,740
down and we had a lot of elements going.

708
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:39,573
I can tell the bull wasn't as good bull 
just by his bugle and we'd been huffing 

709
00:32:43,671 --> 00:32:45,620
it down.
They're done trying to get on a bowl.

710
00:32:45,621 --> 00:32:47,480
That was beautiful and we never could 
get eyes on him.

711
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:48,583
But then I heard what sounded like a 
mature bull and the sun going down and 

712
00:32:52,371 --> 00:32:54,140
that's why you train.
Right,

713
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:56,120
exactly.
That's exact situation.

714
00:32:56,121 --> 00:32:58,010
You're coming out of a hole,
you're climbing,

715
00:32:58,390 --> 00:32:59,750
you know,
9,000 feet.

716
00:32:59,751 --> 00:33:03,080
The air is thin there and it's a race 
against time essentially.

717
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:04,580
But I mean,
we made it work.

718
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:05,510
Yeah,
you don't,

719
00:33:05,511 --> 00:33:06,344
you,
you are able to close the distance in a 

720
00:33:08,481 --> 00:33:10,820
much more efficient way because of all 
your training.

721
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,770
And uh,
that was a good example of.

722
00:33:12,771 --> 00:33:14,510
Another good example of it was the 
packout.

723
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:17,030
I mean we're packing a lot of fucking 
weight.

724
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:17,870
Yeah,
right.

725
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:21,770
This asshole has to fucking elk quarters
in his backpack.

726
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:25,490
So it's like 180 pounds.
And how much is that heavy?

727
00:33:25,491 --> 00:33:26,740
I Dunno.
Heavy Shit.

728
00:33:26,741 --> 00:33:30,290
And you basically have me on your back 
and you're walking a mile with this,

729
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,060
you know,
and there's one,

730
00:33:32,061 --> 00:33:33,290
there's a photo.
Why have I,

731
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,133
I'm sure I have some photos of us from,
from this very trip that we're talking 

732
00:33:37,491 --> 00:33:38,810
about.
We're packing these things out.

733
00:33:38,811 --> 00:33:39,644
But the point is what you're doing to 
acquire when you have an elk steak and 

734
00:33:43,491 --> 00:33:44,324
you sit down with this,
and I had this conversation with Remy 

735
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:48,110
Warren about it where it's like,
it's almost like a religious experience.

736
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:50,510
He's like,
this is a precious piece of meat.

737
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:51,643
I've gone into the Wilderness vested,
I've harvested this animal and I have a 

738
00:33:54,861 --> 00:33:57,230
precious piece of meat.
And he goes and I treat it almost like a

739
00:33:57,231 --> 00:33:58,064
baby,
like I sees in this and I cook it 

740
00:33:59,961 --> 00:34:01,700
perfectly and this is.

741
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:06,170
He has this intensely intimate 
connection and I do with the animal that

742
00:34:06,171 --> 00:34:09,470
we killed that animal that you and I 
killed when I eat that thing.

743
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:13,580
I think of our time together.
I think of how difficult the hunt is.

744
00:34:13,581 --> 00:34:18,040
I think of how crazy the environment is,
how beautiful the experiences.

745
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:18,893
Oh,
you're so much more to it than going 

746
00:34:20,151 --> 00:34:22,460
into a store and buying a squash.
Right?

747
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:23,503
You know,
and this is what people need or 

748
00:34:24,871 --> 00:34:27,170
understanding of state,
even beyond what buying a steak shore,

749
00:34:27,171 --> 00:34:30,970
but buying even a Vegan or a vegetarian,
but your,

750
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,873
your vegetables,
you're disconnected from these 

751
00:34:32,841 --> 00:34:34,970
vegetables for the most part.
Most people are.

752
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:35,963
Yeah.
There is an intense connection with the 

753
00:34:38,121 --> 00:34:40,760
food that you eat.
Even if you grow it yourself,

754
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:44,510
like my wife gardens and I do as well 
and she does it more than I do,

755
00:34:44,511 --> 00:34:47,570
but we'll have salad from something that
we grew in our garden.

756
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:49,490
It's awesome man.
It's awesome.

757
00:34:49,491 --> 00:34:53,510
Like we're chopping tomatoes that we 
planted those seeds and we fertilize the

758
00:34:53,511 --> 00:34:55,370
ground.
We watered it and it came up.

759
00:34:55,371 --> 00:34:56,204
We pick the tomato,
now we're slicing into it and it's a 

760
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,850
process process and that's where the 
hunt,

761
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:02,713
that's where the hunt where the training
and the preparation and the reverence 

762
00:35:05,661 --> 00:35:06,494
for the animal and the harvest and the 
animal and the care of the meet and get 

763
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:12,790
to your house and you put it in your 
freezer and then you thought and you put

764
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:16,550
that whole process is right.
I'll agree with remy.

765
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:21,580
There is reverence to and it means so 
much and for a hunter for and I think,

766
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,393
you know,
as just being a provider and just being 

767
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:26,481
like,
oh,

768
00:35:26,481 --> 00:35:30,170
we say self self sufficient and doing it
is hard.

769
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:32,690
It's a lot easier to go to the store and
say,

770
00:35:32,691 --> 00:35:34,070
Hey,
here's some of my money.

771
00:35:34,071 --> 00:35:35,390
Could I have that meat?
Thank you.

772
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,010
Yay.
Somebody else did all,

773
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:38,010
all the stuff we

774
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,110
just talked about.
Somebody else did that with no reverence

775
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:42,850
and I'm eating it with no reverence,
you know?

776
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,960
So to do it on your own is.
I mean it's,

777
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:49,733
it's why it's what I trained.
It's what I prepare for every day and 

778
00:35:53,011 --> 00:35:54,990
it's a,
it just means so much.

779
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:55,913
Well,
it's

780
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:57,043
enriching in a very strange way that I 
never experienced in my life until I 

781
00:36:01,251 --> 00:36:02,084
started hunting.
I'd never had this kind of connection 

782
00:36:04,371 --> 00:36:06,560
with my food except for me be going 
fishing,

783
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:07,783
you know.
Um,

784
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:08,690
this,
uh,

785
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,553
last summer I took my kids to Hawaii and
my kids love fishing with my little 

786
00:36:13,101 --> 00:36:13,701
girls.
Love it.

787
00:36:13,701 --> 00:36:14,534
It's fun because you know they can put a
line in the water and when they catch 

788
00:36:17,031 --> 00:36:19,130
something and then we're cooking it and 
eating it later,

789
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,233
they're like,
we caught this and they keep saying 

790
00:36:21,561 --> 00:36:22,131
like,
mommy,

791
00:36:22,131 --> 00:36:27,131
we caught this fish that you're eating.
Like there's like a primal connection to

792
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:28,843
this thing,
but other than that I had never 

793
00:36:31,101 --> 00:36:31,934
experienced this sort of primal 
connection to your food and all that 

794
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:42,290
nonsense aside.
Like there's a difference between a fish

795
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,780
and a mammal that just is totally,
and there's a.

796
00:36:44,781 --> 00:36:46,010
there's a big difference.
She.

797
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:48,710
The reverence that you have for,
in my opinion,

798
00:36:48,711 --> 00:36:50,750
the most majestic of animals that you 
hunt,

799
00:36:50,751 --> 00:36:53,090
which is elk.
I think it's the most majestic.

800
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,280
They're,
they're,

801
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,730
they're mythical creatures,
man.

802
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:56,590
Crazy

803
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:57,423
elk.
Sheep.

804
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:58,503
Sheep are up there,
you know where they live and the 

805
00:37:00,641 --> 00:37:04,810
regalness,
but elk is a god just because they're so

806
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:06,810
iconic throughout the west.
You know,

807
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,590
a big bull elk is just what

808
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:11,850
you know when you envisioned the West 
envision mounds.

809
00:37:11,851 --> 00:37:14,010
You think of a big bull elk and then you
say,

810
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:17,940
I'm going to hunt this with my bow.
It's intense.

811
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,790
It's fucking hard to do two and a 
goddamn.

812
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,260
You forget me.
Addicted to this shit.

813
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:23,123
It's a real problem.
I'll text him every now and then like 

814
00:37:24,661 --> 00:37:26,010
I'm in the middle of doing something.
I'm like,

815
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,540
I wish I was bow hunting.
I swear to God.

816
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:30,090
This is boring.
I'd rather even just shooting.

817
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,590
We shot it.
A rubber target today.

818
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,540
It was awesome.
I have a rubber elk.

819
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:36,510
It sets up my hill and we did a little a
facetime video.

820
00:37:36,511 --> 00:37:38,520
We were out there doing it,
but just shooting it.

821
00:37:38,521 --> 00:37:40,360
That rubber is cool now.

822
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,670
No,
that's what I was saying.

823
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:42,583
You can take anybody.
You can take the coolest person you 

824
00:37:44,701 --> 00:37:45,430
know.
Just think,

825
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:49,050
just sit here and think who?
Who's the coolest person I know?

826
00:37:49,051 --> 00:37:51,000
Or who is the coolest girl?
I know.

827
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:52,103
You take that person,
you put a bow in their hand and you get 

828
00:37:54,301 --> 00:37:55,860
them shooting a bow.
They're cooler.

829
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:58,500
No,
that's my.

830
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,333
Yeah.
I mean shooting a bow makes you more of 

831
00:38:01,081 --> 00:38:02,290
a bad ass.
I prefer

832
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,560
girls that don't like to hunt that way.
They don't want to come with me now.

833
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:06,403
I don't want him to have.
They don't complain while they're up 

834
00:38:07,781 --> 00:38:08,614
there and they don't want them to hunt.
I just wonder if shoot a bow does screw 

835
00:38:11,111 --> 00:38:12,160
up my high.
No,

836
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:15,790
I'm kidding.
I like cism now in hunting.

837
00:38:15,791 --> 00:38:18,160
Does it exist?
It does next on Oprah?

838
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,080
No,
I'm Dr drew.

839
00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:21,243
He would love that.
It would get me on there and just 

840
00:38:22,511 --> 00:38:23,344
crucifying would lie and he would get a 
bunch of girls who don't know anything 

841
00:38:25,331 --> 00:38:27,250
about hunting to yell at you but have a 
lot of.

842
00:38:27,251 --> 00:38:28,810
Did a lot of big opinions.
He,

843
00:38:28,811 --> 00:38:29,644
when we got back from Brazil,
it was right when this whole cecil the 

844
00:38:32,831 --> 00:38:33,664
lion shit was going down and these 
people to have a hunter onto yell at 

845
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:38,823
essentially and I was telling you don't 
do it and the first time you didn't do 

846
00:38:42,221 --> 00:38:43,810
it,
I got you to leave.

847
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:45,360
I was in the green room.
I was,

848
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,313
I was in the green room and again her 
hair and makeup and it just like wasn't 

849
00:38:52,421 --> 00:38:54,040
feeling good.
Yeah.

850
00:38:54,041 --> 00:38:56,440
I'm glad you talked to me.
I'm glad we have association.

851
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,660
So I left but then I,
I did go on.

852
00:38:58,661 --> 00:38:59,830
Yes,
you did go on later.

853
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:00,693
But it was after the smoke had settled a
little bit and you went on with a 

854
00:39:03,431 --> 00:39:08,431
conversation about ethical acquisition 
of meat and you know Dr. True eats meat.

855
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:09,843
So yeah,
a lot of those people on that show eat 

856
00:39:11,291 --> 00:39:12,510
meat.
Yeah.

857
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:15,640
It's just bizarre.
It's a bizarre conversation.

858
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,333
I mean that show,
whatever they show is around because 

859
00:39:20,531 --> 00:39:21,364
controversy so well.
One of the font can hilarious things in 

860
00:39:23,771 --> 00:39:24,604
the show was the woman who was saying 
that the reason why there's not so many 

861
00:39:26,621 --> 00:39:29,080
grizzlies just because we've killed off 
all their predators.

862
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:32,670
Right.
That means dinosaurs by the way.

863
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,350
Saber Tooth Tigers,
Grizzly,

864
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:37,990
Jesus Christ.
Have you ever seen a grizzly lady?

865
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,290
Nothing.
Eating them up.

866
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:44,020
Other grizzlies are pretty much the top 
of the food chain and I think,

867
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:44,883
well we are,
but they're not really on the same page 

868
00:39:47,921 --> 00:39:49,750
that we think we are.
They think they are.

869
00:39:49,751 --> 00:39:51,220
So there's a little bit of a conflict 
there.

870
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:52,660
There's a huge conflict.
I mean,

871
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:54,880
essentially it's like two different 
kingdoms.

872
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:55,743
Yeah.
There on the top of the food chain and 

873
00:39:56,831 --> 00:40:00,940
the wild kingdom,
we can get them in their world,

874
00:40:00,941 --> 00:40:02,440
but we gotta get the fuck out as quick 
as we can.

875
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:05,320
We can only exist in their world for a 
couple weeks at the most.

876
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:06,221
And then we're like,
okay,

877
00:40:06,221 --> 00:40:07,054
we got to get back to a,
an actual bed and I need to take some 

878
00:40:09,881 --> 00:40:12,130
vitamins.
Right now it's a,

879
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:14,500
I dunno,
it's well,

880
00:40:14,501 --> 00:40:16,290
according to a,
um,

881
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,860
the woman from,
um,

882
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:19,540
God damn on my brain is foggy.

883
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:22,220
Did after working out.
What's her name from um,

884
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,153
like blows your [inaudible] Akins.
Sue aiken said that she saw a bunch of 

885
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:30,760
wolves run down a young grizzly kill it.
Oh,

886
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:34,750
she said the young grizzly was coming 
out of its den and when they come out of

887
00:40:34,751 --> 00:40:36,040
their den they're kind of weak and 
these,

888
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:36,903
these wolves knew it.
So they chased after it and they were 

889
00:40:38,411 --> 00:40:42,610
biting its legs and then chasing down 
and it happened like a fucking 100 yards

890
00:40:42,611 --> 00:40:44,710
from her house.
$100 for my house.

891
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:46,720
It sounds like she lives in La here,
right?

892
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:49,270
Yeah.
This lady is so bad.

893
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:50,380
Yeah,
she's intense.

894
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:52,370
She's the most gangster woman on the 
planet.

895
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,320
She really is.
She's.

896
00:40:53,321 --> 00:40:58,240
I have massive respect for her.
She's just so cool too.

897
00:40:58,241 --> 00:40:59,074
She came in and she's.
It's not like she's like some weird 

898
00:41:01,481 --> 00:41:04,120
loner who hates people.
She loves people,

899
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:08,440
but she prefers to live in one of the 
harshest climates on the planet.

900
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,960
Two hundred miles above the arctic 
circle.

901
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:13,150
That's awesome.
Just so bad ass.

902
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,890
How much tougher she is in probably 99 
percent of the men that live here in la.

903
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,340
She's tougher than me.
Tell you that.

904
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:20,980
This is what this lady did.
She got attacked by a bear.

905
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:22,270
Bear tore her apart.
Okay.

906
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:24,210
Broke her leg.
Broke her hip,

907
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:25,840
cracked her skull.
She,

908
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:28,060
they,
she had to crawl back to her house.

909
00:41:28,061 --> 00:41:31,150
The bear was just fucking her up because
she was in its territory.

910
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,860
This is bare mauled her right.
She,

911
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:34,063
she managed to live.

912
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:35,023
She got back to her house.
She was stuck for days where she 

913
00:41:37,491 --> 00:41:38,870
couldn't walk.
Her leg was broken.

914
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:40,790
She was stuck.
She couldn't get to the phone.

915
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,920
Okay.
She couldn't lift herself up.

916
00:41:42,921 --> 00:41:45,170
She had a way for someone to find her.
So these people,

917
00:41:45,171 --> 00:41:47,360
founders like,
I think it was seven days later,

918
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:49,040
she got healed up,
went back,

919
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:50,480
shot that bear and ate it.

920
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:54,540
There you go.
That bitch is so gangster bitch with all

921
00:41:54,541 --> 00:41:56,760
due respect.
That is amazing.

922
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:58,500
She's so gangster.
Well,

923
00:41:58,980 --> 00:41:59,813
let,
let me expand on something before I get 

924
00:42:01,621 --> 00:42:06,600
people hating me for a women bowhunters.
I love you.

925
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:07,853
I,
uh,

926
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:10,320
I actually folks,
we are a little bit.

927
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:11,650
I love that women hunt.
I love that.

928
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:12,540
I do too.
I do.

929
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:13,403
I mean I want it.
I'm taking Dana Lesh a bowhunting for 

930
00:42:16,831 --> 00:42:18,330
bear this year.
So I mean,

931
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:19,260
I,
I don't have.

932
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,400
And I want it,
you know,

933
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:23,100
me and eva had been talking about 
getting together for hunt.

934
00:42:23,101 --> 00:42:25,260
So just all joking around.
I do like,

935
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,060
I do just like people shooting bows.
Even.

936
00:42:28,061 --> 00:42:30,630
Yes.
If you can envision this,

937
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:31,613
if Obama shot a bow,
I'd probably think he was cooler and 

938
00:42:34,381 --> 00:42:36,480
that,
that is amazing.

939
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:38,540
That is amazing.
Shocky you should say

940
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:39,830
eve is too,
by the way.

941
00:42:39,831 --> 00:42:43,430
She's the daughter of Jim shockey who's 
been on this show who's an amazing,

942
00:42:43,431 --> 00:42:46,460
fascinating guy who has a show,
even if you don't like hunting,

943
00:42:46,461 --> 00:42:49,430
there's an amazing show called uncharted
and it's.

944
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:53,360
It's barely about hunting.
It's really about different cultures and

945
00:42:53,361 --> 00:42:54,194
this guy goes to all these discount.
Jim shockey is as cool and interesting 

946
00:42:58,461 --> 00:43:00,440
as it gets.
He is just a fascinating,

947
00:43:00,441 --> 00:43:01,274
fascinating guy and he travels to these 
remote places in the middle of a Russia 

948
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:10,541
and he went to Afghanistan and he's he.
He went to Africa to this remote village

949
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:13,183
that has a massive problem with 
crocodiles and it was an incredible 

950
00:43:16,251 --> 00:43:17,990
show.
It's an hour long show.

951
00:43:17,991 --> 00:43:20,150
I mean,
it could be on the discovery channel.

952
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:23,360
It could be on a,
on HBO,

953
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:25,100
could be on anything.
It just so happens.

954
00:43:25,101 --> 00:43:26,980
It's on.
Is it on the outdoorsman?

955
00:43:26,981 --> 00:43:27,814
Is Channel outdoor channel,
outdoor channel and this guy goes to 

956
00:43:31,791 --> 00:43:33,110
this place and you're seeing these 
people,

957
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:35,270
like half the people in the village had 
been mauled.

958
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:37,040
I mean,
people are missing arms.

959
00:43:37,041 --> 00:43:37,874
They're missing legs.
Their faces have been cut open because 

960
00:43:40,101 --> 00:43:41,900
they're getting killed by crocodiles 
left and right,

961
00:43:41,901 --> 00:43:45,170
and while he was there filming a woman 
got taken by a crocodile.

962
00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:46,363
They've set up these sort of rudimentary
fences that they put in place to keep 

963
00:43:51,141 --> 00:43:55,310
the crocodiles out of these area where 
these people gather water and you know,

964
00:43:55,311 --> 00:43:56,144
and he's there with these other hunters 
where they're trying to take out once a 

965
00:44:00,531 --> 00:44:02,900
crocodile apparently starts eating 
people,

966
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:05,180
but you got to kill it because got a 
taste for it.

967
00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:06,380
Well,
they got a taste for it and they realize

968
00:44:06,381 --> 00:44:07,214
how easy it is.
Like a wildebeest can fuck up a 

969
00:44:09,261 --> 00:44:10,580
crocodile a little bit,
you know,

970
00:44:10,581 --> 00:44:12,710
you throw a kick at it and break his 
jaw.

971
00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:16,100
I mean the crocodile is incredibly tough
and durable animal,

972
00:44:16,101 --> 00:44:19,930
but a wildebeest is a tough scrap.
It's a big animal and you know,

973
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:22,340
like a water buffalo,
that's a scrap.

974
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:25,850
It's a big animal to work for that.
It might not work out a person.

975
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,180
God Man,
we're made out of Jello,

976
00:44:27,330 --> 00:44:28,430
Jello and popsicle sticks.

977
00:44:28,590 --> 00:44:29,391
Nothing.
Well,

978
00:44:29,391 --> 00:44:32,910
and I hunted crocodile.
I mean really they are.

979
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:35,820
They're tough.
Where'd you hung crocodile in Africa?

980
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:38,880
In Tanzania.
I wanted to kill one.

981
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:43,920
And so to get within range of a you have
to build a blind and they come up,

982
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:44,783
you know,
their eyes are just above the water and 

983
00:44:46,711 --> 00:44:47,544
for a bow you have like two bumps.
They got a bump above the eye and one 

984
00:44:50,641 --> 00:44:53,310
back here you have to be like right 
below that are writing between.

985
00:44:53,311 --> 00:44:55,860
You're shooting at about a fifty cent 
piece size.

986
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:58,740
You have to break them because if you 
hit them in the lungs,

987
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:01,620
they're in the water and then they sink.
You don't get them.

988
00:45:01,770 --> 00:45:03,660
So if you're going to hunter crocodile 
with a bow,

989
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:06,000
it has to be brain shot.
Drop them.

990
00:45:06,001 --> 00:45:08,370
So to do that you have to get them up 
off the shore,

991
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,720
right.
And uh,

992
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:12,330
could never happen.
Built a blind,

993
00:45:12,331 --> 00:45:16,200
had the Beta.
It was just like so hard to do that.

994
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:17,393
But uh,
one of the guys I was with killed one 

995
00:45:18,581 --> 00:45:20,670
with a,
with a rifle and we ate it.

996
00:45:20,671 --> 00:45:22,170
And the meat is amazing.

997
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:23,093
Well,
it's supposed to be the highest protein 

998
00:45:24,061 --> 00:45:27,030
meat you can get,
like alligator and crocodile is supposed

999
00:45:27,031 --> 00:45:31,320
to be one ounce per ounce,
one of the highest in protein content.

1000
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:32,461
Amazing.
Yeah,

1001
00:45:32,461 --> 00:45:34,170
I mean it was,
it was so good too.

1002
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:35,550
But uh,
yeah,

1003
00:45:35,551 --> 00:45:36,384
they,
they are,

1004
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,610
they're smart.
They're tough.

1005
00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:40,290
I don't think they're smart.
I think they're stupid as fuck.

1006
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:41,640
Well,
try to kill him.

1007
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:44,790
I just think they know how to not get 
killed.

1008
00:45:44,791 --> 00:45:47,400
Like they have a couple of calculations 
they make in their brand.

1009
00:45:47,401 --> 00:45:48,860
Is that a person you know?
Fuck this dude.

1010
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,480
Okay.
The brain is very small.

1011
00:45:51,481 --> 00:45:53,160
I'll give you that because it's a small 
target,

1012
00:45:53,370 --> 00:45:55,890
but if you're trying to hunt them,
you're going to think they're smart.

1013
00:45:56,190 --> 00:45:57,870
If you're going to do a crossword puzzle
with them,

1014
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:01,410
probably not that smart.
Fascinating though,

1015
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:02,253
man.
I won't want us.

1016
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,150
I want,
wouldn't give a shout out.

1017
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:08,220
Not only to Jim shockey because he is 
the ultimate savage love gym,

1018
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:11,160
but in Love Eva,
but their son,

1019
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:14,950
brandon brandon is the mastermind behind
the shooting of that show,

1020
00:46:14,990 --> 00:46:15,600
right?
He,

1021
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:16,370
you know,
as far as

1022
00:46:16,370 --> 00:46:17,203
filming and the production value.
And what you see on tv that's brand 

1023
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:22,970
shockey amazing.
And he is,

1024
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:24,283
I think he could film like the,
the Best Hollywood movie you've ever 

1025
00:46:29,691 --> 00:46:30,770
seen.
He could do that.

1026
00:46:30,771 --> 00:46:33,620
He has that talent and right now he's 
doing it on the outdoor channel.

1027
00:46:33,621 --> 00:46:35,240
So that's,
if nothing else,

1028
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:37,540
go and watch his work.
Yeah.

1029
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:40,240
On that show.
And the notion uncharted,

1030
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:41,470
uncharted,
which is amazing.

1031
00:46:41,471 --> 00:46:43,210
And the new show,
Carter's wars war,

1032
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:48,360
Carter's war is all about this guy who's
combating against poaching in Africa and

1033
00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:49,703
it's all about stopping poachers from 
killing rhinos and elephants and all 

1034
00:46:53,141 --> 00:46:54,970
these different animals that they're 
killing in Africa.

1035
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:56,073
And uh,
so it's not really a hunting show as 

1036
00:46:58,031 --> 00:46:58,864
much as it's just a pure conservation 
show about a guy who's trying to stop 

1037
00:47:02,531 --> 00:47:03,880
poaching in Africa.
And it's,

1038
00:47:04,210 --> 00:47:05,043
it's amazing and gritty and incredibly 
well documented and shot and just man 

1039
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:11,890
the,
the world of Africa.

1040
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:12,813
If you want to watch a documentary,
and I've mentioned this before to 

1041
00:47:15,041 --> 00:47:16,780
people,
so I'm sorry if you heard it before,

1042
00:47:16,781 --> 00:47:17,614
but um,
our friend Louis Theroux who's been on 

1043
00:47:19,511 --> 00:47:21,700
the show before,
who's an amazing documentary,

1044
00:47:21,990 --> 00:47:22,823
a documentary guy,
documentarian from the UK did a show on 

1045
00:47:27,371 --> 00:47:28,204
these hunting in Africa,
which is very different from what you 

1046
00:47:31,931 --> 00:47:32,560
did in Africa.

1047
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:35,110
What you did in Africa.
You went to the actual wild who Africa,

1048
00:47:35,410 --> 00:47:40,360
not a high fence operation,
but these hunting ranches that they have

1049
00:47:40,361 --> 00:47:43,780
set up in Africa.
It's such a catch 22.

1050
00:47:43,781 --> 00:47:44,614
It's such A.
There's so much contradiction going on 

1051
00:47:45,911 --> 00:47:49,030
because on one hand these animals are 
trapped in this.

1052
00:47:49,390 --> 00:47:52,330
It's usually enormous,
like several thousand Acre area.

1053
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:53,253
It can be where they're trapped in these
areas and they're hunted and the people 

1054
00:47:56,351 --> 00:47:59,410
call it a can hunt and a lot of people 
that have a lot of hate for it,

1055
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:00,453
but on the other hand,
the animals that they're hunting have 

1056
00:48:02,621 --> 00:48:03,454
never been healthier and higher numbers 
and a lot of them were on the verge of 

1057
00:48:05,801 --> 00:48:06,634
extinction until they started 
implementing these high fence 

1058
00:48:08,621 --> 00:48:09,454
operations.
And it goes back to the same thing we 

1059
00:48:10,991 --> 00:48:13,480
were talking about,
the money for conservation,

1060
00:48:13,570 --> 00:48:14,403
the real money that these people are 
getting in Africa is coming from 

1061
00:48:16,271 --> 00:48:17,060
hunting.

1062
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:17,893
That's what's paying for these animals 
to survive because so many people are 

1063
00:48:20,351 --> 00:48:22,620
going over there to hunt and people say,
well,

1064
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,460
animals have value exists.
The key.

1065
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:27,100
And that's so fucking weird concept for 
people.

1066
00:48:27,370 --> 00:48:30,730
If an animal doesn't have value,
it's probably going to be extinct.

1067
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:32,560
Yeah,
I mean that's how.

1068
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:33,670
That's.
That's why.

1069
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:34,773
That's why hunter's care.
That's why conservation is care because 

1070
00:48:37,001 --> 00:48:39,400
the animal is valuable.
Whether it's right,

1071
00:48:39,401 --> 00:48:41,560
wrong or indifferent.
When there's value.

1072
00:48:41,650 --> 00:48:42,483
People care and people have an 
understanding today that they didn't 

1073
00:48:45,401 --> 00:48:46,234
have this several hundred years ago.
Like when people look at the gigantic 

1074
00:48:49,121 --> 00:48:52,210
mounds of buffalo skulls,
that's a perfect example.

1075
00:48:52,211 --> 00:48:53,044
Why you need conservation.
You can't just have people run out and 

1076
00:48:55,811 --> 00:48:56,644
kill these animals that have value with 
no consequence or with no monitoring of 

1077
00:49:00,911 --> 00:49:01,744
the herd populations and health.
That's when you get these horrific mass 

1078
00:49:05,890 --> 00:49:06,723
extinction events like what happened 
with the buffalo and the buffalo were 

1079
00:49:09,910 --> 00:49:11,950
basically brought to the verge of 
extinction.

1080
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:15,100
Now they're in healthy populations to 
the point where you can actually,

1081
00:49:15,101 --> 00:49:18,040
in some places you can hunt wild ones.
The same thing could be,

1082
00:49:18,041 --> 00:49:19,120
say,
a set of elk.

1083
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:20,133
The Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation has 
done an amazing job of repopulating 

1084
00:49:23,771 --> 00:49:26,440
areas with elk where they were at one 
point in time,

1085
00:49:26,590 --> 00:49:27,940
completely eradicated.
Well,

1086
00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:31,360
did you know that when you tuck elk deer
Turkey,

1087
00:49:31,870 --> 00:49:32,703
when you talk about there's more of 
those species now than there's ever 

1088
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:37,630
been.
Is that true with elk?

1089
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:39,520
Because I know it is with white tail 
deer.

1090
00:49:39,521 --> 00:49:42,160
There's more white tail deer today then 
when Columbus landed,

1091
00:49:42,370 --> 00:49:43,203
but I don't know if that's the case with
elk because there's more places where 

1092
00:49:46,331 --> 00:49:49,720
they don't exist.
I think like most of the area where like

1093
00:49:49,721 --> 00:49:51,670
Steven Rinella did a whole show on this 
recently,

1094
00:49:51,850 --> 00:49:54,700
but most of the area where elk used to 
be,

1095
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,730
they're not,
but in the areas where they are,

1096
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,620
they're in healthy populations.

1097
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:02,530
I'm on Jamie.
Can you look this up?

1098
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:03,310
Yeah,
look this up.

1099
00:50:03,310 --> 00:50:06,340
Look it up about that populations 
because I'm almost positive.

1100
00:50:06,341 --> 00:50:07,174
There's more now.
See Elk are and probably rinella would 

1101
00:50:10,601 --> 00:50:11,650
dallas.
So maybe you know,

1102
00:50:11,651 --> 00:50:14,610
if he's been on the show,
but elk are there,

1103
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:18,370
plains animals originally they're pushed
into the mountains because the planes,

1104
00:50:18,371 --> 00:50:19,204
that's where we live.
We live where there's water and in the 

1105
00:50:20,801 --> 00:50:21,634
valleys,
that's where humans setup their cities 

1106
00:50:23,021 --> 00:50:23,854
and that's,
you know,

1107
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:28,460
to get user rivers and we need water.
So they have been pushed and now they're

1108
00:50:28,461 --> 00:50:29,294
mountain animals.
But now there's elk where there hasn't 

1109
00:50:31,791 --> 00:50:35,930
been out before Pennsylvania,
Kentucky and places like that.

1110
00:50:35,931 --> 00:50:36,764
So maybe they're,
maybe they're more places than they've 

1111
00:50:40,101 --> 00:50:41,390
ever been,
but I'm almost,

1112
00:50:41,810 --> 00:50:43,640
I'm almost certain there's even more 
elk,

1113
00:50:43,641 --> 00:50:46,850
but whatever the case,
I don't even think there are more places

1114
00:50:46,851 --> 00:50:47,630
than they've ever been.

1115
00:50:47,630 --> 00:50:48,463
I think it's the ones that are there are
in healthier populations in the used to 

1116
00:50:52,041 --> 00:50:55,640
be I think,
but I think elk are a lot like a buffalo

1117
00:50:55,910 --> 00:50:58,490
in that there's one point in time,
like hundreds of years ago,

1118
00:50:58,491 --> 00:50:59,890
they were just shooting the shit out of 
them.

1119
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:01,820
They're almost eradicated.
Oh right.

1120
00:51:01,821 --> 00:51:04,820
I know now they're,
they're bounced back and they're healthy

1121
00:51:04,821 --> 00:51:06,530
everywhere.
And where'd that money come from?

1122
00:51:06,531 --> 00:51:09,210
Cameron hanes.
I want to say hunter.

1123
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,113
Yes.
Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation that 

1124
00:51:11,590 --> 00:51:14,200
they've done a fantastic job and then 
they,

1125
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,073
they've done,
they've been on the forefront of 

1126
00:51:16,161 --> 00:51:17,600
protecting habitat,
so that's,

1127
00:51:17,630 --> 00:51:19,910
I know they've been over 6 million acres
protected,

1128
00:51:19,911 --> 00:51:22,880
I think maybe close to 7 million now or 
maybe even over.

1129
00:51:22,881 --> 00:51:23,714
I haven't kept track recently,
but that's 7 million acres that can 

1130
00:51:25,881 --> 00:51:29,060
never be used for anything else other 
than habitat for animals.

1131
00:51:29,061 --> 00:51:29,894
And that's not just elk,
that's deer to elk numbers across six 

1132
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:34,010
dates.
How do we look in there?

1133
00:51:34,310 --> 00:51:35,870
See,
this is across states,

1134
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:37,190
but I think,
um,

1135
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:38,150
maybe we could keep looking.

1136
00:51:38,190 --> 00:51:39,023
Can we see that in American elk 
populations dwindled to less than 

1137
00:51:41,311 --> 00:51:45,360
100,000 by the early 19 nineties now.
And that's insane.

1138
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:49,800
And now in 2009 grew to 1 million.
Thirty $1,000.

1139
00:51:49,850 --> 00:51:52,340
That's incredible.
So the 19 nineties,

1140
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:53,983
that's insane.
It was down to 100,000 in the 19 

1141
00:51:56,061 --> 00:51:56,930
nineties.
Wow.

1142
00:51:56,931 --> 00:51:58,990
That's terrifying.
But that's,

1143
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:01,340
that's the verge of extinction in our 
lifetime.

1144
00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:04,010
Not just in our lifetime,
but in when we were both men.

1145
00:52:04,190 --> 00:52:06,110
Yeah.
So during that time,

1146
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:06,940
totally.
No,

1147
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:08,260
that can't be right.
Is it?

1148
00:52:08,410 --> 00:52:10,110
No.
The early 19,

1149
00:52:10,150 --> 00:52:10,983
now that's got to be 18 nineties whereas
this hasn't it see the lessons of the 

1150
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:16,000
last word of the first paragraph

1151
00:52:16,490 --> 00:52:20,480
by 1984 there was an estimated 715,000 
elk in North America.

1152
00:52:20,610 --> 00:52:23,760
No Fred above there.
The last word of the first paragraph.

1153
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:24,773
Fortunately a toto toto American that 
less than $100,000 in a 100,000 in the 

1154
00:52:29,341 --> 00:52:30,660
early 19 nineties.
So that,

1155
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:33,000
that can't be 19 nineties is it?
It's an incorrect.

1156
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:34,490
That's what he's saying.
But yeah it might be,

1157
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:36,090
it might be a miss.
I think that's

1158
00:52:37,590 --> 00:52:41,630
yeah.
Cause cause cause it says in 1984

1159
00:52:41,630 --> 00:52:43,070
84,
there's 750.

1160
00:52:43,071 --> 00:52:45,430
So went all the way back right?
Yeah.

1161
00:52:45,450 --> 00:52:46,700
Yeah.
That must be a typo.

1162
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:47,490
But anyway,
so,

1163
00:52:47,490 --> 00:52:52,100
so that's what dom typo whose,
whose fucking go go.

1164
00:52:52,101 --> 00:52:54,330
What does it say?
Go Hunt seat.

1165
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:59,480
I don't necessarily trust a lot of these
hunting sites for things like that.

1166
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:02,060
Like that's A.
I trust him when they support the point.

1167
00:53:02,061 --> 00:53:05,350
I'm trying to fuck up.
That's a giant fuck ups.

1168
00:53:05,351 --> 00:53:07,850
I did email that site.
Somebody who's listening,

1169
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:09,670
please email that site and let us know 
fixed.

1170
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:12,140
I think it's supposed to be 18 nineties 
and I would say,

1171
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:15,200
and I would say less than 100,000 and 
now it's over a million.

1172
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:17,000
So that's,
that's where I get that.

1173
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:18,233
The point that I was making,
but I think before people colonized the 

1174
00:53:23,121 --> 00:53:24,860
west,
I think they were everywhere.

1175
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:25,913
I think that's what,

1176
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:27,490
that's what Rinella was saying.
Maybe.

1177
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:28,343
So I think what he was saying was that 
they're not in 90 percent of the places 

1178
00:53:32,371 --> 00:53:34,420
they used to be in,
but the,

1179
00:53:34,510 --> 00:53:36,390
the places they're in,
it's like thriving.

1180
00:53:36,410 --> 00:53:37,530
They're thriving.
Yeah.

1181
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:40,050
And this is,
this is a really important point when it

1182
00:53:40,051 --> 00:53:40,884
comes to,
like we were talking about grizzly 

1183
00:53:42,001 --> 00:53:43,230
bears,
like people say,

1184
00:53:43,231 --> 00:53:44,064
look,
the grizzly bears are almost extinct in 

1185
00:53:45,151 --> 00:53:46,200
Santa Monica.
Yes,

1186
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:48,450
you're right.
They're almost extinct in California.

1187
00:53:48,451 --> 00:53:51,990
They only live in California,
but not a ton in California to Alaska.

1188
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,910
They're fucking everywhere.
And there's a lot of um,

1189
00:53:53,911 --> 00:53:57,060
folks in Alaska which is twice the size 
of Texas.

1190
00:53:57,061 --> 00:54:00,300
It's a goddamn enormous state.
And they are,

1191
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:02,910
they are big and there's a lot of them,
right?

1192
00:54:03,030 --> 00:54:03,863
And they decimate herds of Caribou elk 
and they estimate that something around 

1193
00:54:08,881 --> 00:54:09,714
like where John and Jen live in Alberta,
more than 50 percent of the Moose are 

1194
00:54:13,141 --> 00:54:15,580
killed at birth by bears.

1195
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:17,610
That's where the bears,
they follow.

1196
00:54:17,611 --> 00:54:21,360
So a cow moose is pregnant,
it's going to drop,

1197
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:23,100
drop the calf.
Right?

1198
00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:26,850
And so bears will know that Moose is 
pregnant.

1199
00:54:26,970 --> 00:54:28,710
No,
she's going to be dropping a calf.

1200
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:32,100
They follow her as soon as she drops a 
calf right there,

1201
00:54:32,190 --> 00:54:33,540
kill it and eat it.
That's how.

1202
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:35,280
That's how they get hurt.
They just follow the Moose around.

1203
00:54:35,930 --> 00:54:38,410
Not even then,
a lot of times they're pulling it out of

1204
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:40,160
the cow's body.
Right?

1205
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:40,790
I mean that's how

1206
00:54:40,790 --> 00:54:41,870
it.
They're brutal.

1207
00:54:41,930 --> 00:54:43,340
I mean,
life in the wild.

1208
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,190
It's not a fairy tale out there.
Real deal.

1209
00:54:46,191 --> 00:54:48,560
It's life and death.
And so they're doing,

1210
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:50,840
they're just going to kill.
They're going to kill.

1211
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:52,490
That's all they care about.
Throwing a kill.

1212
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:53,750
Eat.
That's how they survive.

1213
00:54:53,751 --> 00:54:55,370
So there's nothing wrong with that.
No,

1214
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:56,733
I'm not.
They do.

1215
00:54:57,020 --> 00:55:00,770
I'm not going to judge them.
But uh,

1216
00:55:01,010 --> 00:55:02,060
yeah,
so where I was,

1217
00:55:02,061 --> 00:55:02,894
I was in um,
in 16 in Alaska and you can see a 

1218
00:55:06,201 --> 00:55:10,820
nonresident can kill to brown bear,
which are basically salmon fed,

1219
00:55:10,821 --> 00:55:13,430
grizzly,
grizzly bear and three black bear,

1220
00:55:13,490 --> 00:55:15,530
so he can go up there and kill five 
bear,

1221
00:55:15,950 --> 00:55:19,010
which I wanted to do,
but don't think that I'm blood thirsty.

1222
00:55:19,030 --> 00:55:19,550
Thank that.
I,

1223
00:55:19,550 --> 00:55:22,340
I want to help the most and I like the 
bear meat.

1224
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:23,970
So,
um,

1225
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:26,810
I didn't do it,
but I mean that's what killed three.

1226
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:27,823
I killed three.
But that gives you an example of how 

1227
00:55:29,571 --> 00:55:32,120
many,
how many bears are our.

1228
00:55:32,270 --> 00:55:36,440
And this is by biologists who are paid 
and who have went to school and with who

1229
00:55:36,441 --> 00:55:37,274
have studied the carrying capacity of 
the land and how many animals they 

1230
00:55:39,711 --> 00:55:41,330
determined this.
This isn't,

1231
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:45,110
this isn't hunters determining this,
this is Alaska fish and game.

1232
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:47,480
So that's where I have a problem with 
the people who are,

1233
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:50,820
who think they know better than people 
who this is their passion,

1234
00:55:50,821 --> 00:55:52,640
this is what they care about.
They have boots on the ground,

1235
00:55:52,641 --> 00:55:53,320
they're doing it.
They're,

1236
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:54,153
they're setting the bag limits.
So you don't know if you don't live 

1237
00:55:56,601 --> 00:55:59,330
there and study this and this has been 
your life mission.

1238
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:01,520
You don't know more than them so.

1239
00:56:01,570 --> 00:56:03,670
Well their wildlife biologist and by the
way,

1240
00:56:03,671 --> 00:56:06,520
if those populations aren't kept at a 
healthy level,

1241
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:07,653
they send in people that they pay to 
kill these animals and this is an 

1242
00:56:10,481 --> 00:56:11,314
important factor and this is what we're 
talking about with California because 

1243
00:56:13,151 --> 00:56:16,000
California doesn't have a hunting season
for mountain lions.

1244
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:18,640
They have to pay people to go in and 
kill these mountain lions.

1245
00:56:18,850 --> 00:56:20,490
They're not just letting them out in 
lines live.

1246
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:23,050
Not if they become a problem,
they're taking them out.

1247
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:24,730
They just don't want to deal with the 
backlash.

1248
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:25,570
Exactly.
That's it.

1249
00:56:25,570 --> 00:56:28,490
So they're just avoiding the backlash 
and it's not doing it quietly.

1250
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:29,333
It's not for the betterment of the 
animal or or you know the ecosystem or 

1251
00:56:33,671 --> 00:56:34,504
anything like that.
It's just because they don't want to 

1252
00:56:35,261 --> 00:56:36,820
deal with the,
with the drama.

1253
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:40,330
And then you get these people.
Well they were here first.

1254
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:42,390
Where were they?
Are they were here?

1255
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:43,091
No,
they weren't.

1256
00:56:43,091 --> 00:56:47,260
First of all that mountain lions five.
I was here way before that fuck.

1257
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:48,933
And they as in they come on stop.
This is the whole place was covered in 

1258
00:56:52,870 --> 00:56:55,390
ice 10,000 years ago.
So shut up.

1259
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:57,490
Like what are you talking about?
Who is they?

1260
00:56:57,670 --> 00:56:58,503
What is this word?
This is the world we're living in right 

1261
00:57:00,311 --> 00:57:01,870
now.
In 2016.

1262
00:57:01,990 --> 00:57:03,910
And a mountain lion ate this fucking 
dudes cat.

1263
00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:05,083
What are we going to do?
We're going to just let them out in 

1264
00:57:06,201 --> 00:57:08,200
line.
He his kid now because it would,

1265
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:09,113
if you leave that kid on the swing and 
you go into kid fucking answer your 

1266
00:57:11,021 --> 00:57:11,854
email real quick and you come back,
your kids not gone and see that fucking 

1267
00:57:13,781 --> 00:57:14,920
tail.
Hop over the fence.

1268
00:57:15,250 --> 00:57:18,420
That's how it works.
That's the wild barbecued a turnover.

1269
00:57:18,430 --> 00:57:20,170
Your Veggie Burger,
you know,

1270
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:21,760
that kid's gone.

1271
00:57:22,810 --> 00:57:24,370
Um,
Cecil.

1272
00:57:24,770 --> 00:57:26,000
Alright,
so this is the uh,

1273
00:57:26,001 --> 00:57:28,300
the,
this is the billboard that my grandpa.

1274
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:30,190
No,
my grandpa's name was Joseph.

1275
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:31,413
Look at this fucking photograph.
There is a lion that is hugging a bear 

1276
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:36,213
and the lion has a tear rolling down his
face and the bear has a tear rolling 

1277
00:57:39,281 --> 00:57:42,040
down his face.
And it says they banned the bear hunt.

1278
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:46,480
They are all Cecil Save New Jersey 
barriers.com.

1279
00:57:46,870 --> 00:57:48,050
Oh my God.
For his.

1280
00:57:48,051 --> 00:57:49,660
Makes me want to punch somebody in the 
face.

1281
00:57:49,690 --> 00:57:52,420
What kind of fucking crazy person 
living,

1282
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:53,573
living some weird bubble made this 
billboard and spent actual human money 

1283
00:57:57,101 --> 00:57:58,180
on it.
Yeah.

1284
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:01,420
I don't know.
Fantasy land if they haven't seen.

1285
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:02,433
Okay.
They have a giant problem with bears in 

1286
00:58:03,971 --> 00:58:05,140
New Jersey.
And this is,

1287
00:58:05,170 --> 00:58:07,870
this is this facts behind this.
First of all,

1288
00:58:07,871 --> 00:58:08,704
a student from rutgers was fucking 
killed by a bear right outside of 

1289
00:58:11,861 --> 00:58:12,250
rutgers.

1290
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:13,083
He,
that photograph student took this photo 

1291
00:58:14,351 --> 00:58:16,980
of a bear just before it killed them.
Um,

1292
00:58:17,230 --> 00:58:18,063
I was talking to a guy who is,
who knows rangers out there and they're 

1293
00:58:21,401 --> 00:58:22,234
telling people not to hike.
They have so many Goddamn bear in New 

1294
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:26,860
Jersey.
And why do they have so many bear?

1295
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:29,260
Because they didn't have a hunt for 
them.

1296
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:32,710
So these God damn things,
they got overpopulated and they have now

1297
00:58:32,711 --> 00:58:33,544
they're,
they're entering into residential 

1298
00:58:34,481 --> 00:58:36,200
neighborhoods.
And these laundry.

1299
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:39,940
Look at this fucking video.
Bear fight far rockaway,

1300
00:58:39,941 --> 00:58:42,700
New Jersey,
August 14th of 2014.

1301
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:46,750
These bears are duking it out,
these are big black bears,

1302
00:58:46,751 --> 00:58:50,560
like seven foot bears,
400 plus pound bears,

1303
00:58:50,561 --> 00:58:53,470
and they are going to war in this guy's 
front lawn.

1304
00:58:53,890 --> 00:58:54,723
These are huge.
I mean if you were in Alberta and you 

1305
00:58:56,861 --> 00:58:58,420
saw one of these bears coming in and 
you'd be like,

1306
00:58:58,450 --> 00:58:59,283
Ooh,
boy,

1307
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:01,810
that's a trophy bear.
That's a giant bear.

1308
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:03,850
That's hundreds of pounds of meat for 
the grill.

1309
00:59:04,610 --> 00:59:07,300
And these bears are in this guy's lawn.
I mean,

1310
00:59:07,301 --> 00:59:10,240
this isn't a,
this isn't some crazy rural,

1311
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:11,133
you know,
Akins living in the middle of the 

1312
00:59:12,941 --> 00:59:13,720
nowhere.
No,

1313
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:16,900
in this jersey,
this thing just knocked over a lamp post

1314
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:18,700
and now it's colliding with these,
uh,

1315
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:20,740
garbage pails.
Watch this.

1316
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:21,950
They come,
they're

1317
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:25,700
fighting over territory by the way.
That's created by garbage.

1318
00:59:25,970 --> 00:59:26,803
That's what the territory is.
They attack people's garbage and these 

1319
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:31,593
two bears,
they bite each other and then they do 

1320
00:59:33,041 --> 00:59:34,730
get out.
Look at the size of these bears.

1321
00:59:34,731 --> 00:59:36,440
Now,
these are huge,

1322
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:37,161
right?
Well,

1323
00:59:37,161 --> 00:59:38,630
that's,
that's why.

1324
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:42,590
Okay,
so maybe there was before there's houses

1325
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:44,360
that was perfect bear habitat,
but guess what?

1326
00:59:44,361 --> 00:59:45,194
There's houses now.
So that means we have to control the 

1327
00:59:47,511 --> 00:59:48,830
bare numbers that's hunting.
Well,

1328
00:59:48,831 --> 00:59:52,550
here's another part of the problem.
These bears weren't here 30 years ago.

1329
00:59:52,910 --> 00:59:53,743
These bears are overpopulating and 
moving into these neighborhoods and 

1330
00:59:56,751 --> 00:59:57,584
they're doing it because they know that 
people live there and it's a steady 

1331
00:59:59,811 --> 01:00:01,220
supply of food.
Garbage.

1332
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:03,380
Yeah.
When you live in Colorado.

1333
01:00:03,381 --> 01:00:04,214
And Colorado is a,
they had a big issue with it in this 

1334
01:00:05,871 --> 01:00:06,704
area where I was,
where the bears would find out that 

1335
01:00:09,171 --> 01:00:12,080
people put their garbage in a certain 
area and once they eat there,

1336
01:00:12,081 --> 01:00:12,914
once that's it,
they have to capture those bears and 

1337
01:00:15,351 --> 01:00:19,340
they either relocate them to zoos or,
or figure something out.

1338
01:00:19,550 --> 01:00:20,630
But one,
when I was there,

1339
01:00:20,631 --> 01:00:21,610
we went to this,
uh,

1340
01:00:21,650 --> 01:00:22,483
wildlife rescue place and they had this 
gigantic grizzly bear that they had 

1341
01:00:25,371 --> 01:00:26,204
gotten because we'll get a fucking giant
chunks of further tearing off of each 

1342
01:00:29,901 --> 01:00:31,220
other.
Look at that.

1343
01:00:31,221 --> 01:00:34,570
It's insane.
They're bs.

1344
01:00:34,670 --> 01:00:35,503
And now I love this video because a car 
pulls up and the cars that they started 

1345
01:00:37,851 --> 01:00:40,760
taking selfies with the bears.
But um,

1346
01:00:40,790 --> 01:00:41,623
they had to relocate this grizzly 
because it's just started tearing apart 

1347
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:46,130
people's cars.
They found it,

1348
01:00:46,131 --> 01:00:48,810
found food and someone's car once was at
grizzly black.

1349
01:00:49,050 --> 01:00:51,710
It was a brown bear and it's one that 
they had had,

1350
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:53,690
I don't know where they had gotten it,
but,

1351
01:00:53,691 --> 01:00:55,220
uh,
but it happens with black bear.

1352
01:00:55,221 --> 01:00:56,570
It happens with bears.
Yeah.

1353
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:57,531
No,
it's just,

1354
01:00:57,531 --> 01:00:58,364
it's just,
you know,

1355
01:00:58,730 --> 01:01:00,710
the numbers need to be controlled.
That's all there is to.

1356
01:01:00,730 --> 01:01:02,750
It doesn't have a large brown bear 
population.

1357
01:01:02,750 --> 01:01:03,350
Right,
Chris?

1358
01:01:03,350 --> 01:01:04,183
Well,
it wouldn't be brown bear brown bear 

1359
01:01:05,781 --> 01:01:08,450
when they're near the coast and Grizzly,
we're inland brown bear.

1360
01:01:08,451 --> 01:01:10,880
They eat fish.
So they're on,

1361
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:12,320
how do they call them?
Different names,

1362
01:01:13,610 --> 01:01:15,620
different species,
I guess is what they've determined.

1363
01:01:15,750 --> 01:01:16,583
You know,
there are bigger because they fish and 

1364
01:01:17,651 --> 01:01:19,440
they get all that protein.
So they,

1365
01:01:19,530 --> 01:01:22,310
you know,
they can be up 1400 pounds.

1366
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:27,980
Where as a mountain grizzly in average 
mountain grizzly might be seven foot 500

1367
01:01:29,091 --> 01:01:30,200
pounds.
You know,

1368
01:01:30,201 --> 01:01:32,060
I mean,
life's tough or up in the mountains,

1369
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:34,760
they're eating blueberries when the 
blueberries are on,

1370
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:36,290
um,
you know,

1371
01:01:36,620 --> 01:01:41,180
eating what they can.
But the bears that eat the fish there,

1372
01:01:41,181 --> 01:01:42,860
gorging on fish,
they get big.

1373
01:01:42,890 --> 01:01:45,530
It's just a high protein diet.
Kinda like what you're on right now.

1374
01:01:46,010 --> 01:01:48,490
I'm on a high protein diet.
You're like fat too?

1375
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:49,470
Yeah.
This,

1376
01:01:49,470 --> 01:01:51,920
this diet is kind of for the birds but 
not really.

1377
01:01:52,210 --> 01:01:56,180
Birds eat grain.
I'm enjoying.

1378
01:01:56,181 --> 01:01:57,014
I mean it's not bad but for two weeks 
and I really like a bowl of pasta right 

1379
01:01:59,841 --> 01:02:01,880
now,
but it's going well.

1380
01:02:02,030 --> 01:02:03,830
I bet it's interesting.
Yeah.

1381
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:08,940
Well that whole Cecil and the bear 
hugging thing that it's insane.

1382
01:02:09,650 --> 01:02:11,690
Yeah.
I guarantee you a woman made that.

1383
01:02:13,180 --> 01:02:14,660
How about that folks?
I'm now.

1384
01:02:14,690 --> 01:02:17,360
I'm done with.
I'm done with that part.

1385
01:02:17,361 --> 01:02:18,350
I don't know.
That may be.

1386
01:02:18,420 --> 01:02:20,010
It could be a gay guy.
Could be a week.

1387
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:21,920
Dude,
I'll,

1388
01:02:22,010 --> 01:02:24,600
I'll sex gender,
all that nonsense aside.

1389
01:02:24,601 --> 01:02:26,640
We're joking around here folks.
What that is,

1390
01:02:26,641 --> 01:02:28,230
is just someone who doesn't understand 
it's,

1391
01:02:28,270 --> 01:02:30,880
it's crazy ignorance and um,
the,

1392
01:02:30,950 --> 01:02:31,783
the idea that you want to let these 
things keep fucking and breeding and 

1393
01:02:34,980 --> 01:02:35,813
overpopulating to the point where 
they're killing college students just 

1394
01:02:37,591 --> 01:02:40,320
outside of rutgers and they're having 
these two,

1395
01:02:40,470 --> 01:02:43,320
400 plus pound bears,
duke it out on your front lawn.

1396
01:02:43,350 --> 01:02:45,330
That's not good folks.
It's not good.

1397
01:02:45,620 --> 01:02:46,150
You know,
I'd,

1398
01:02:46,150 --> 01:02:49,380
I'd like to see these people that think 
that the bears hugging each other.

1399
01:02:49,381 --> 01:02:50,430
Go break the,
you know,

1400
01:02:50,460 --> 01:02:51,900
come on guys.
Let's settle down.

1401
01:02:51,901 --> 01:02:53,640
Break it up.
Go break those bears up.

1402
01:02:53,850 --> 01:02:54,683
Up.
Since apparently they cry and have 

1403
01:02:55,921 --> 01:02:57,600
emotions.
You know,

1404
01:02:57,620 --> 01:03:00,600
Cecil has a brother who's protecting his
family.

1405
01:03:00,601 --> 01:03:01,710
Jericho.
Kay.

1406
01:03:01,711 --> 01:03:04,140
Go break up that bear fight.
Let me know how that goes.

1407
01:03:04,170 --> 01:03:05,003
What is this?

1408
01:03:05,390 --> 01:03:08,310
Samantha is from their website.
Save and Jay Baer's dot com.

1409
01:03:08,370 --> 01:03:11,420
Oh God.
So this is another name you don't part.

1410
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:12,750
I think,
you know,

1411
01:03:12,751 --> 01:03:13,584
we're only facilitating this issue right
here with naming the bears that 

1412
01:03:16,831 --> 01:03:19,260
humanizing them,
because if you watch the superbowl,

1413
01:03:19,410 --> 01:03:20,243
it seemed like every other commercial 
was something an animal seeing foreign 

1414
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:27,390
animal talking or it's like,
I mean,

1415
01:03:27,391 --> 01:03:31,950
I saw sheep singing in the acapella 
group.

1416
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:33,750
I'm like,
what is going on?

1417
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:35,070
Well,
and so that's,

1418
01:03:35,130 --> 01:03:39,690
that's where hunters are fighting for 
our place right now because the kids are

1419
01:03:39,691 --> 01:03:43,590
seeing that and weak people are seeing 
that and people that don't get,

1420
01:03:43,591 --> 01:03:44,424
Hey,
I want to be part of the food chain are 

1421
01:03:46,081 --> 01:03:48,660
seeing that and they're like humanizing 
these animals.

1422
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:54,060
Sheep don't care about anything but 
eating,

1423
01:03:54,150 --> 01:03:55,310
eating and fucking.
Yeah,

1424
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:56,520
they do.
They stay alive.

1425
01:03:56,550 --> 01:03:58,810
They're not talking,
they're not talking about,

1426
01:03:58,820 --> 01:04:00,210
oh,
here comes a guy who was bringing us our

1427
01:04:00,211 --> 01:04:00,510
food.

1428
01:04:00,510 --> 01:04:01,343
Let's see.
You know,

1429
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:02,430
they're not,
they're not.

1430
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:04,800
It's not realistic,
but that's the,

1431
01:04:05,010 --> 01:04:07,320
that's the,
that's the programming,

1432
01:04:07,350 --> 01:04:08,183
the programming that's getting out there
and just met missing with the hardwire 

1433
01:04:11,630 --> 01:04:13,730
of these young people coming up with A.
Well,

1434
01:04:13,740 --> 01:04:14,573
a lot of hunters attribute Bambi as 
being a turning point in the way 

1435
01:04:17,791 --> 01:04:19,410
Americans viewed hunting.
Yeah,

1436
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:20,273
because then all of a sudden you've seen
this beautiful animal getting chased 

1437
01:04:23,341 --> 01:04:24,810
down and killed by a hunter.
Yeah.

1438
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:27,450
And well,
we need to fight.

1439
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:29,700
We need to fight to change that.
I think we are.

1440
01:04:29,790 --> 01:04:32,220
I mean we are because uh,
you know,

1441
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:35,460
every time you see a hunter on a show or
on a who,

1442
01:04:35,790 --> 01:04:38,880
I don't even know what it's been on.
I think south parks even had something,

1443
01:04:38,881 --> 01:04:43,881
but it's obviously it's some redneck 
hillbilly drinking beer,

1444
01:04:46,770 --> 01:04:49,200
you know,
no respect for anything that's always,

1445
01:04:49,350 --> 01:04:51,360
even in all the Hollywood movies,
that's what,

1446
01:04:51,390 --> 01:04:54,600
that's what they,
that's the image they portray.

1447
01:04:55,410 --> 01:04:57,690
We need to change that.
We're trying to,

1448
01:04:57,840 --> 01:04:58,673
we're trying to.
And I think with podcasts and with 

1449
01:05:01,291 --> 01:05:02,124
conversations on the Internet,
at least information is getting to 

1450
01:05:04,711 --> 01:05:06,960
people that they weren't getting before.
I've had many,

1451
01:05:06,961 --> 01:05:11,610
many people both on twitter,
on my website forum,

1452
01:05:11,860 --> 01:05:12,693
on facebook,
on all these different forms of social 

1453
01:05:15,331 --> 01:05:17,980
media.
Say I had a perception of

1454
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:21,310
hunters until yet.
Guys like Cameron Hanes on Jim Shockey,

1455
01:05:21,340 --> 01:05:23,920
Steve Rinella,
Steven know remy warrant.

1456
01:05:23,921 --> 01:05:24,754
He's really intelligent people that can 
talk about Tim Barnett who can talk 

1457
01:05:28,271 --> 01:05:32,170
about these things in a way where they 
explain to you their perspective,

1458
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:35,650
their grew up with this.
This is how they've lived their life and

1459
01:05:35,651 --> 01:05:38,440
if you lived your life in a city,
it doesn't make sense to you.

1460
01:05:38,441 --> 01:05:40,150
It seems alien.
You Watch Bambi,

1461
01:05:40,151 --> 01:05:43,630
you see these Yogi talks to booboo.
They have conversations.

1462
01:05:43,810 --> 01:05:46,920
Why would you want to shoot one of them 
until you,

1463
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:49,900
you.
You venture into that world.

1464
01:05:49,901 --> 01:05:52,240
You don't understand it,
and we're.

1465
01:05:52,450 --> 01:05:55,210
We're insulated from it because of 
supermarkets,

1466
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:57,790
because of this bizarre world we live 
in.

1467
01:05:57,860 --> 01:06:01,030
When we've created these artificial 
structures that we think are normal,

1468
01:06:01,150 --> 01:06:02,690
these cities and these,
these,

1469
01:06:02,790 --> 01:06:03,623
this method of acquiring food,
will you just run a piece of plastic 

1470
01:06:06,911 --> 01:06:09,670
through a machine and you walk away with
all this food?

1471
01:06:10,030 --> 01:06:11,740
It's not healthy.
No,

1472
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:12,880
it's not.
It's not.

1473
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:13,953
It's like if you could have sex with a 
faceless person where you didn't even 

1474
01:06:18,761 --> 01:06:19,594
get to see their face,
like all you saw was like their body 

1475
01:06:21,371 --> 01:06:24,120
from the shoulder down and that's what 
you had sex within you.

1476
01:06:24,140 --> 01:06:26,500
You had a kid with that person,
you even know that kidney and walk away,

1477
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:28,700
but I got my needs met.
I mean almost.

1478
01:06:28,701 --> 01:06:29,534
That's almost what's going on.
It's almost what's going on when you're 

1479
01:06:32,321 --> 01:06:35,880
acquiring food without ever growing it,
without planting that seed,

1480
01:06:36,180 --> 01:06:37,013
and I'm not saying you should fucking 
plant all your food and I'm not saying 

1481
01:06:39,461 --> 01:06:41,110
you should only hunt if you're going to 
eat me,

1482
01:06:41,290 --> 01:06:43,600
but what I'm saying is if you could do 
it,

1483
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:47,890
it would bring you a little closer to 
understanding where that food comes from

1484
01:06:48,070 --> 01:06:48,903
and it'll give you a.
A just a broader view of this world we 

1485
01:06:52,721 --> 01:06:57,340
live in and what you're doing by 
consuming food you are consuming.

1486
01:06:57,340 --> 01:06:59,410
Whether you consuming salad and here's 
another thing,

1487
01:06:59,411 --> 01:07:01,360
vegans.
I put this up the other day.

1488
01:07:01,361 --> 01:07:04,150
I was fucking with a bunch of people 
where I've trolled.

1489
01:07:05,110 --> 01:07:06,700
People are sending me all this vegan 
stuff,

1490
01:07:06,701 --> 01:07:07,534
so I just started trolling them by 
sending them all these scientific 

1491
01:07:09,911 --> 01:07:13,540
studies about plants and plant 
intelligence,

1492
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:14,733
which is a new form of study or it's a.
it's a new field of study where they're 

1493
01:07:18,491 --> 01:07:19,324
finding out more and more each day that 
plants can do calculations that they 

1494
01:07:23,351 --> 01:07:26,110
respond to being eaten,
that they have a.

1495
01:07:26,230 --> 01:07:30,760
They have different mechanisms to 
discourage predation.

1496
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:31,713
That's where poisoned plants come from.
They are communicating with each other 

1497
01:07:34,691 --> 01:07:38,350
in some sort of strange way that when 
one tree is getting chopped down,

1498
01:07:38,351 --> 01:07:39,184
it's sending signals to other trees.
It's whether it's an in it's own way in 

1499
01:07:43,090 --> 01:07:46,030
some sort of a weird way.
Your reading life,

1500
01:07:46,510 --> 01:07:48,160
if you're eating a plant,
your eating life,

1501
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:52,090
if you say that it's okay to eat 
vegetable life,

1502
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:55,300
but it's not okay to eat fish if you say
it's okay to eat fish,

1503
01:07:55,301 --> 01:07:58,010
but it's not okay to eat animals.
If you.

1504
01:07:58,690 --> 01:08:02,520
What you're doing is you're making these
bizarre moral judgments and they're,

1505
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:06,910
they're based on convenience and there's
a lot of them are based on ignorance and

1506
01:08:06,911 --> 01:08:08,290
a lot of them,
they don't hold up.

1507
01:08:08,291 --> 01:08:11,260
When you start looking at things 
subjectively and people say to you,

1508
01:08:11,270 --> 01:08:12,820
what,
why don't you eat your dog?

1509
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,200
Well,
I don't want to eat my dog.

1510
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:16,040
Okay,
Jesus Christ,

1511
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:17,970
but my dog as a pet.
Okay.

1512
01:08:17,990 --> 01:08:20,150
My dog was raised from the time it was a
baby,

1513
01:08:20,151 --> 01:08:22,250
have had it since it was young.
I'm not going to eat it,

1514
01:08:22,670 --> 01:08:23,503
but if someone does have a wild dog and 
eat it and it's between that wild dog 

1515
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:30,560
eating them and them eating that wild 
dog,

1516
01:08:31,090 --> 01:08:32,990
you know,
that's an unfortunate situation,

1517
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:35,330
but you got to eat that fucking dog.
Yeah.

1518
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:38,840
Manny Pacquiao is parents.
They eat their dog when they were,

1519
01:08:38,910 --> 01:08:40,550
when he was starving.
When you were a kid.

1520
01:08:40,850 --> 01:08:44,450
It was like a really traumatic moment 
for him where his family was.

1521
01:08:44,451 --> 01:08:46,520
So there were starving.
They were so poor.

1522
01:08:46,700 --> 01:08:48,270
They had to eat their pet dog.
Yeah.

1523
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:49,700
Well,
and then the people would say,

1524
01:08:49,701 --> 01:08:50,720
well,
you're not starving.

1525
01:08:50,721 --> 01:08:52,070
Why are you killing animals?
Right.

1526
01:08:52,130 --> 01:08:53,420
For us,
because I don't want to starve.

1527
01:08:54,140 --> 01:08:57,630
That's a good point.
What would I like active?

1528
01:08:57,740 --> 01:08:58,573
What I liked the most,
we talked about changing the stereotype 

1529
01:09:00,351 --> 01:09:01,320
is I like,
you know,

1530
01:09:01,540 --> 01:09:05,750
working as we know workout all the time.
I like when people asked me,

1531
01:09:06,050 --> 01:09:09,110
why are you working out so hard for 
bowhunting?

1532
01:09:09,170 --> 01:09:11,990
And this was like that.
That is the craziest look,

1533
01:09:12,210 --> 01:09:14,150
you know?
But it's been the same answer for me for

1534
01:09:14,151 --> 01:09:16,730
years is because I want to be the best 
in the mountains.

1535
01:09:16,731 --> 01:09:19,760
I think that the best that you can be 
the best I can be.

1536
01:09:19,820 --> 01:09:20,653
Yeah,
I understood that way more after I went 

1537
01:09:21,681 --> 01:09:22,760
with you.
You know,

1538
01:09:22,820 --> 01:09:25,010
after I went hunting with you in 
Colorado,

1539
01:09:25,011 --> 01:09:25,844
I get it.
I get it more because you're in better 

1540
01:09:26,781 --> 01:09:28,910
cardiovascular shape than me and I'm in 
good shape.

1541
01:09:29,220 --> 01:09:30,053
You take the average person,
I'm in better shape than the average 

1542
01:09:31,431 --> 01:09:33,110
person and I'm not in better shape than 
you.

1543
01:09:33,370 --> 01:09:34,880
You're fucking running ahead of me.

1544
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:36,290
I'm like,
this the fuck I can't catch up.

1545
01:09:38,030 --> 01:09:38,863
You know,
it's like there's a certain pace that 

1546
01:09:39,891 --> 01:09:40,724
you can keep because you run mountains 
all the time that I'm just not capable 

1547
01:09:43,941 --> 01:09:47,030
of keeping right now.
It made me up my cardio and a big time,

1548
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:48,073
big time way.
When I came back from that hunt was the 

1549
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:51,680
first thing I started doing is really up
in my cardio.

1550
01:09:51,890 --> 01:09:52,860
Well.
And I,

1551
01:09:52,940 --> 01:09:54,770
you know,
so we had a real,

1552
01:09:54,890 --> 01:09:57,140
you know,
real life example of that.

1553
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:00,170
What I like as much as that.
I mean not,

1554
01:10:00,260 --> 01:10:01,093
not as much as that because I love being
with somebody who is successful and who 

1555
01:10:04,370 --> 01:10:06,860
experiences a hunt and I'm able to share
in that.

1556
01:10:07,070 --> 01:10:09,230
And that's a whole nother thing.
It's like I didn't,

1557
01:10:09,290 --> 01:10:10,123
I didn't kill anything but I was part of
your hunt and that meant as much to me 

1558
01:10:14,090 --> 01:10:15,610
is me getting my animals.

1559
01:10:15,610 --> 01:10:18,830
So we have the whole comradery and you 
know,

1560
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:20,870
it's not every man for himself,
it's,

1561
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:22,610
we're out there,
we're working together,

1562
01:10:22,611 --> 01:10:23,444
we're,
we want to be successful in harvest 

1563
01:10:25,011 --> 01:10:26,780
meeting,
take me home to our families.

1564
01:10:27,110 --> 01:10:30,950
But what I like is people who are 
inspired,

1565
01:10:30,951 --> 01:10:31,784
they're not with me,
but they see the training and they're 

1566
01:10:33,681 --> 01:10:35,930
inspired to up their game.
Like maybe they're,

1567
01:10:36,020 --> 01:10:40,190
maybe they won't run a 200 mile race or 
run 10 miles a day or do any of this,

1568
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:42,890
but maybe they'll run one mile.
You know?

1569
01:10:42,891 --> 01:10:47,390
And maybe it's making.
My whole thing is if you're not making,

1570
01:10:47,450 --> 01:10:50,180
if you're not making a positive impact,
what's your point?

1571
01:10:50,690 --> 01:10:51,523
What are you doing?
I want to make a positive impact on 

1572
01:10:53,151 --> 01:10:53,984
people and that's why I love social 
media and sharing what I do and 

1573
01:10:56,751 --> 01:10:58,460
hopefully it can inspire others to do 
more.

1574
01:10:58,461 --> 01:11:00,200
And that's,
that's my motivation daily.

1575
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:01,940
Well,
there's a great.

1576
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:05,090
This is a great time for that and it's 
a,

1577
01:11:05,091 --> 01:11:05,924
it's a,
there's a great venue or a great a 

1578
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:12,020
vehicle through social media that didn't
exist before.

1579
01:11:12,090 --> 01:11:14,070
Right.
Inspire people and I am constantly

1580
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:15,300
inspired by it,
you know,

1581
01:11:15,301 --> 01:11:16,750
and some people get upset,
legroom,

1582
01:11:16,820 --> 01:11:18,540
you fucking post and pooch.
So you work.

1583
01:11:18,550 --> 01:11:19,890
No,
he fucking showing off.

1584
01:11:19,891 --> 01:11:22,710
Like I like when I read the rocks,
Instagram,

1585
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:25,470
I do,
I think 40 million other people do.

1586
01:11:25,471 --> 01:11:28,650
Also.
Deaf fucking guy is up every morning.

1587
01:11:28,651 --> 01:11:29,484
If he's got to work at seven,
he's up at four and he's in the gym and 

1588
01:11:32,370 --> 01:11:33,203
they'll show a photo of his alarm clock 
going off and it'll show a photo of him 

1589
01:11:36,301 --> 01:11:40,530
in the gym making crazy faces where it's
folded sweat and it makes me realize I'm

1590
01:11:40,531 --> 01:11:42,960
a lazy bitch and it makes me want to get
up and work out.

1591
01:11:42,961 --> 01:11:43,710
Exactly.
You know,

1592
01:11:43,710 --> 01:11:46,770
I mean that's just where there's a 
community.

1593
01:11:46,830 --> 01:11:49,470
People want to be inspired.
I think they definitely do.

1594
01:11:49,471 --> 01:11:53,070
I know I do and I know that you've 
created a community,

1595
01:11:53,220 --> 01:11:57,030
your instagram page and a lot of ways,
and I want to say it's your community,

1596
01:11:57,031 --> 01:12:00,870
but you have spawned through your 
instagram page.

1597
01:12:00,930 --> 01:12:03,990
A lot of inspirational communities as 
well.

1598
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:04,973
I've looked at these other people's 
pages that follow you and I'll see like 

1599
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:08,633
the Hashtag keep hammering and they're 
out doing things and I see people 

1600
01:12:11,401 --> 01:12:12,660
responding their posts,
you know,

1601
01:12:12,661 --> 01:12:15,120
I saw this and it made me go to the gym 
and I wasn't going to.

1602
01:12:15,121 --> 01:12:17,850
So thank you for that.
And it branches off.

1603
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:20,400
It feeds into everybody and it's 
positive.

1604
01:12:20,401 --> 01:12:22,560
It's positive for all of us.
And at the end of the day,

1605
01:12:22,561 --> 01:12:23,341
look,
you know,

1606
01:12:23,341 --> 01:12:24,174
you can make all your fucking angry 
videos and you can make all your angry 

1607
01:12:27,031 --> 01:12:29,180
posts and shit on this and shit on that 
and,

1608
01:12:29,430 --> 01:12:30,263
and,
and get angry about people you don't 

1609
01:12:31,021 --> 01:12:32,010
even meet.
But what is the,

1610
01:12:32,070 --> 01:12:32,903
what is the message that you're putting 
out this angry shitty message that you 

1611
01:12:37,191 --> 01:12:38,790
are putting out this angry negative 
thing?

1612
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:39,650
Yeah.
Who,

1613
01:12:39,650 --> 01:12:42,930
who's getting you pumping yourself up or
you stay.

1614
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:46,500
You're standing on a moral high ground 
and espousing your,

1615
01:12:46,501 --> 01:12:48,150
your,
your superiority to the world.

1616
01:12:48,151 --> 01:12:49,380
Like what are you doing?
What are you doing?

1617
01:12:49,410 --> 01:12:51,360
Are you broadcasting that?
And you know,

1618
01:12:51,361 --> 01:12:53,040
who was inspired by that?
Nobody.

1619
01:12:53,190 --> 01:12:55,590
What some people might be to also be 
like,

1620
01:12:55,591 --> 01:12:57,750
this guy's a good cut.
I want to be a no,

1621
01:12:57,800 --> 01:12:59,940
I'd never heard.
I guess I don't hang around those people

1622
01:12:59,941 --> 01:13:01,470
because I never hear that.
Well,

1623
01:13:01,471 --> 01:13:02,850
you don't see him.
I'll tell you what,

1624
01:13:02,851 --> 01:13:03,684
when you know,
like if you meet one of those people in 

1625
01:13:05,011 --> 01:13:05,844
real life,
I guarantee you the conversation 

1626
01:13:07,021 --> 01:13:07,854
wouldn't be like it is in these one 
sided debates or these one sided 

1627
01:13:10,591 --> 01:13:12,800
broadcast.
If someone makes a blogs,

1628
01:13:12,810 --> 01:13:14,100
angry,
shitty blog,

1629
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:15,910
like you have a conversation with that 
person,

1630
01:13:15,911 --> 01:13:20,070
it's tweets and blogs like especially if
they're negative,

1631
01:13:20,420 --> 01:13:24,270
it's a very ineffective form of 
communication and negative videos.

1632
01:13:24,390 --> 01:13:25,223
They're very ineffective because this is
a not a real conversation like the way 

1633
01:13:29,911 --> 01:13:33,300
people are supposed to communicate is 
like you and I talking to each other,

1634
01:13:33,620 --> 01:13:36,120
you know,
even fucking podcasts and a lot of ways.

1635
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:38,700
It's one of the things why people get 
angry because a,

1636
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:40,140
there's someone listening to this right 
now,

1637
01:13:40,170 --> 01:13:43,350
like you motherfucker.
I got something to say and I get it.

1638
01:13:43,380 --> 01:13:45,570
I understand,
but don't get mad at me.

1639
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:47,820
If you were here,
we would talk,

1640
01:13:47,850 --> 01:13:49,650
but you're not here.
Should we take a few calls?

1641
01:13:50,910 --> 01:13:52,550
We don't do Colin's thinker.
No,

1642
01:13:52,740 --> 01:13:54,350
it's too hard.
You know,

1643
01:13:54,390 --> 01:13:56,760
the beautiful thing about the internet 
is everybody has a voice.

1644
01:13:56,790 --> 01:13:58,690
You can text me about the internet is 
everybody.

1645
01:13:59,220 --> 01:14:00,390
You got my number,
text me.

1646
01:14:00,391 --> 01:14:02,010
So that'll,
that'll eliminate a lot of people.

1647
01:14:03,180 --> 01:14:04,020
You know,
you can,

1648
01:14:04,470 --> 01:14:07,470
you can choose what message you put out 
there.

1649
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:12,520
You can choose how you experience life.
You can choose like how you,

1650
01:14:12,550 --> 01:14:15,610
how you interact with people and some 
people that think they're,

1651
01:14:15,740 --> 01:14:17,560
you know,
this is a new world we're living in this

1652
01:14:17,561 --> 01:14:18,394
world of social media,
this world where anybody can start a 

1653
01:14:20,861 --> 01:14:25,861
blog or anybody can start putting things
up on twitter or facebook or whatever.

1654
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:29,890
It's a new world and we got to learn how
to navigate it better.

1655
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:30,760
Well,
you know,

1656
01:14:30,761 --> 01:14:31,750
people,
like you said,

1657
01:14:31,751 --> 01:14:32,590
people can choose.

1658
01:14:32,650 --> 01:14:35,020
I can choose to.
I put up positive.

1659
01:14:35,050 --> 01:14:35,883
Yeah.
You don't think I have negative things 

1660
01:14:37,181 --> 01:14:38,410
happen in my life?
Of course.

1661
01:14:38,470 --> 01:14:39,303
Yeah.
I could put a negative probably as much 

1662
01:14:40,691 --> 01:14:41,524
as positive.
I'm overcoming all sorts of hurdles all 

1663
01:14:42,761 --> 01:14:45,130
the time.
But what's the point?

1664
01:14:45,220 --> 01:14:47,080
I'm like,
I said I want to be positive.

1665
01:14:47,081 --> 01:14:51,250
I want to inspire people and you know,
at the show and in Utah this weekend,

1666
01:14:51,610 --> 01:14:52,443
um,
I was amazed at the number of people 

1667
01:14:56,290 --> 01:15:00,610
that waited a long time to come up and 
share their story,

1668
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:04,210
share their story about losing weight or
the success they've had or the,

1669
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:08,770
or the impact as a hunter with a bow 
hunter who,

1670
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:12,340
how would a bowhunter make that much of 
an impact?

1671
01:15:12,341 --> 01:15:15,130
I have no idea,
but it happened and that,

1672
01:15:15,550 --> 01:15:16,700
I mean,
if,

1673
01:15:16,701 --> 01:15:17,890
if you ever wonder,
you know,

1674
01:15:17,891 --> 01:15:20,410
what's your calling in life?
Because I've wondered what am I,

1675
01:15:20,530 --> 01:15:21,550
what am I doing,
you know,

1676
01:15:21,551 --> 01:15:22,450
when I was young,
what's,

1677
01:15:23,230 --> 01:15:24,940
what,
where am I going,

1678
01:15:24,941 --> 01:15:26,440
what's going to happen?
Well,

1679
01:15:27,430 --> 01:15:28,263
weekends,
like this weekend where I saw those 

1680
01:15:29,411 --> 01:15:33,190
people and talk to those people and have
that interaction that really drives home

1681
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:35,530
I'm doing what I'm meant to do,
you know?

1682
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:36,393
And that's making a positive impact and 
I mean that's through bowhunting mean 

1683
01:15:40,481 --> 01:15:41,920
that's it.
That's what I do.

1684
01:15:42,010 --> 01:15:43,300
That's how I met you.
Yeah.

1685
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:45,640
I mean I met you through bowhunting and 
social media.

1686
01:15:45,641 --> 01:15:46,570
I mean,
your,

1687
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:47,433
your positive message reached me and we 
talked about it on the Gritty Bowman 

1688
01:15:50,351 --> 01:15:51,200
podcast,
which we,

1689
01:15:51,550 --> 01:15:52,383
we just did a.
We dropped in and did a podcast and 

1690
01:15:54,131 --> 01:15:57,760
impromptu podcasts with these guys.
They called themselves the gritty bowman

1691
01:15:58,240 --> 01:16:01,010
and it's good but good bowhunting 
podcast,

1692
01:16:01,030 --> 01:16:01,863
and we sat and we talked about it like I
was interested in hunting for a long 

1693
01:16:05,831 --> 01:16:06,664
time before I met Steven Rinella and 
then when I'm going on different 

1694
01:16:11,621 --> 01:16:14,140
websites and looking at different 
youtube videos,

1695
01:16:14,590 --> 01:16:16,780
I saw your stuff and I'm like,
oh,

1696
01:16:16,781 --> 01:16:17,614
okay.
Well here's this guy that's really into 

1697
01:16:18,761 --> 01:16:19,594
fitness.
He's into fitness and preparing himself 

1698
01:16:22,271 --> 01:16:23,104
to be what you call the ultimate 
Predator to be your best at what you 

1699
01:16:26,771 --> 01:16:27,960
like to do,
which is bowhunting.

1700
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:28,331
I'm like,
well,

1701
01:16:28,331 --> 01:16:30,610
this is kind of crazy.
So then I started watching your videos.

1702
01:16:30,610 --> 01:16:31,960
I'm like,
what a positive dude.

1703
01:16:32,130 --> 01:16:34,480
This guy's working out.
He's given people great advice.

1704
01:16:34,690 --> 01:16:38,440
He's telling people like how to use 
proper technique with archery and how to

1705
01:16:38,441 --> 01:16:41,110
have a good attitude about this and how 
it's all good and you're like,

1706
01:16:41,290 --> 01:16:42,990
it's a beautiful day.
We're out here.

1707
01:16:43,020 --> 01:16:46,300
We're enjoying the beautiful weather,
we're out here practicing this,

1708
01:16:46,301 --> 01:16:47,490
what we do every day,
and I was like,

1709
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:51,460
this is inspirational and this is 
positive and and through you,

1710
01:16:51,490 --> 01:16:52,323
you meet me.
I use my what I've created this vehicle 

1711
01:16:57,131 --> 01:17:01,630
of social media and podcasting to 
broadcast it more and then all these new

1712
01:17:01,631 --> 01:17:04,370
positive branches spread out from that.
It's awesome.

1713
01:17:04,380 --> 01:17:05,900
It's amazing.
I love it.

1714
01:17:06,010 --> 01:17:08,290
It's so much better than shitting on 
people.

1715
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:11,000
It is so much better than negativity and
like I said,

1716
01:17:11,001 --> 01:17:14,210
when I had these guys from cowspiracy 
and these guys are vegans,

1717
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:15,073
they're vegans who made a documentary 
about veganism and the powerful message 

1718
01:17:18,231 --> 01:17:21,110
that they had about the anti factory 
farming message.

1719
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:24,320
I had a great conversation with them and
I believe,

1720
01:17:24,321 --> 01:17:25,154
I truly believe that most of these 
people that are making angry posts on 

1721
01:17:29,660 --> 01:17:30,493
twitter or angry videos,
if I sat down with them and had 

1722
01:17:33,051 --> 01:17:35,630
conversations with them,
they'd be positive conversations.

1723
01:17:35,990 --> 01:17:39,770
Whether we agree or disagree.
I have a very well thought out point.

1724
01:17:39,950 --> 01:17:40,783
I would imagine they have a very well 
thought out point to where they're 

1725
01:17:42,861 --> 01:17:44,270
coming from.
It's not a bad thing.

1726
01:17:44,450 --> 01:17:47,430
It's just this,
something is lost in this,

1727
01:17:47,650 --> 01:17:52,650
the broadcasting of this message.
I think that's a real problem that we're

1728
01:17:52,701 --> 01:17:53,534
all sort of navigating in this world.
Is that somehow or another the messages 

1729
01:17:58,521 --> 01:18:01,360
that get the most reaction or a lot of 
times the negative.

1730
01:18:01,690 --> 01:18:02,930
Yeah.
Yeah,

1731
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:05,450
I know well On,
uh,

1732
01:18:06,230 --> 01:18:08,480
in regard to hunting.
Why do you like archery?

1733
01:18:08,570 --> 01:18:12,770
Do you like archery better than rifle?
Hunting definitely is more challenging.

1734
01:18:12,830 --> 01:18:15,860
It's more in.
It's there's,

1735
01:18:16,030 --> 01:18:18,800
there's a book called Zen and the art of
archery.

1736
01:18:19,790 --> 01:18:20,623
It was a book that I need to read.
Everybody tells me I need to read this 

1737
01:18:22,791 --> 01:18:23,624
book,
but there's something about archery 

1738
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:30,170
itself like today when we're practicing 
shooting at that rubber elk.

1739
01:18:30,210 --> 01:18:32,900
Yeah.
There's something about the.

1740
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:34,593
There is a,
there's a moment when you were at full 

1741
01:18:38,301 --> 01:18:43,301
draw and you're about to release that 
Arrow where everything is still.

1742
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:48,110
Everything is calm and you're not 
thinking about anything else.

1743
01:18:48,111 --> 01:18:48,944
You can't other than releasing the 
perfect Arrow because it requires so 

1744
01:18:51,741 --> 01:18:56,741
much concentration and so much focus.
And I was completely unexpected to me.

1745
01:18:56,990 --> 01:19:00,440
When I first started practicing archery,
I thought it was going to be like,

1746
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:03,260
like shooting a rifle requires a lot of 
focus.

1747
01:19:03,290 --> 01:19:04,123
It requires trigger discipline.
You have to like steady the gun arrests 

1748
01:19:06,660 --> 01:19:08,060
do you have to look,
you know,

1749
01:19:08,061 --> 01:19:11,210
really stay still and squeeze that 
trigger and there's problems with that.

1750
01:19:11,210 --> 01:19:12,500
You know,
you get the shakes,

1751
01:19:12,710 --> 01:19:13,543
you know,
you get nerves and even at a target 

1752
01:19:14,721 --> 01:19:15,271
range,
you know,

1753
01:19:15,271 --> 01:19:19,880
you know the gun's going to make that 
kick and say you get paid a flint chase.

1754
01:19:19,910 --> 01:19:22,430
Yeah.
It's nothing like archery archery's that

1755
01:19:22,431 --> 01:19:23,630
times 100.
It's,

1756
01:19:23,660 --> 01:19:25,310
it requires,
there's no resting,

1757
01:19:25,370 --> 01:19:27,050
there's no rifle rest.
You know,

1758
01:19:27,051 --> 01:19:32,051
you have to hold your arm steady and the
amount of movement that you make because

1759
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:36,290
the arrows only going at the most 300 
feet a second,

1760
01:19:36,291 --> 01:19:37,970
3:50.
If you've got some super bone,

1761
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,300
a light Arrow,
the difference between that and a rifle.

1762
01:19:40,301 --> 01:19:42,140
Six thousand feet a second,
it says arrive.

1763
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:43,153
Yeah.
So any movement translates to a giant 

1764
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:49,480
amount of movement at the end where the 
arrowheads.

1765
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:52,580
Yeah.
And it's just as a discipline,

1766
01:19:52,990 --> 01:19:54,830
it's,
it's cleansing.

1767
01:19:55,230 --> 01:19:57,860
Like for me,
I love after a long day,

1768
01:19:57,861 --> 01:19:59,270
I do a lot of Shit,
man.

1769
01:19:59,271 --> 01:20:01,520
I got a lot of things going on in my 
mind,

1770
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:04,880
you know,
I have between comedy and podcasting and

1771
01:20:04,881 --> 01:20:08,310
the UFC and family and the business 
bullshit

1772
01:20:08,370 --> 01:20:09,203
and it's like so much bullshit going on.
There's so many different things in my 

1773
01:20:11,671 --> 01:20:16,250
mind that for me would archery is,
is like,

1774
01:20:16,350 --> 01:20:17,183
this is like ultimate meditation is 
ultimate focus point where I draw back 

1775
01:20:21,780 --> 01:20:26,780
and I see that target and then I release
that Arrow and then when that,

1776
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:29,670
when that Arrow goes right into that 
bullseye,

1777
01:20:29,820 --> 01:20:30,653
like we were shooting that rubber elk 
today and when you nail one it gets 

1778
01:20:32,851 --> 01:20:35,380
right in that small circle.
Oh,

1779
01:20:35,530 --> 01:20:37,710
it's a beautiful,
satisfying feeling.

1780
01:20:37,711 --> 01:20:38,544
It is.
It's that moment that in the impact and 

1781
01:20:40,561 --> 01:20:42,360
seeing where it hit.
I mean,

1782
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:45,210
and then so that's just the process of 
it.

1783
01:20:45,211 --> 01:20:49,020
But then when that happens because what,
why are we doing that?

1784
01:20:49,021 --> 01:20:50,610
We're doing that to prepare for the 
hunt.

1785
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:51,553
Yeah.
So when all that work pays off on the 

1786
01:20:54,121 --> 01:20:55,890
hunt,
it's just,

1787
01:20:55,891 --> 01:20:57,540
uh,
you know,

1788
01:20:57,541 --> 01:20:58,800
I don't,
I don't know how to,

1789
01:20:59,060 --> 01:20:59,893
you know,
I see some videos and I see people 

1790
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:05,040
running around and tackling each other 
and doing all that.

1791
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:08,940
I never feel like that.
I always feel like I'm,

1792
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:09,863
I feel,
I guess blessed are thankful for the 

1793
01:21:11,401 --> 01:21:16,401
moment and mostly thankful that I made 
something that's very difficult happen.

1794
01:21:18,150 --> 01:21:21,440
You know,
I achieved that goal and it's a,

1795
01:21:22,740 --> 01:21:23,573
I dunno,
it's,

1796
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:25,320
it's so powerful.
And I just,

1797
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:26,550
that's what I,
you know,

1798
01:21:26,730 --> 01:21:29,610
I like people to shoot a bow because as 
you said,

1799
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:30,473
shooting a bow is,
is centering and it zen like I guess if 

1800
01:21:33,871 --> 01:21:35,790
I even know what zen means,
I don't even know if I do,

1801
01:21:35,791 --> 01:21:37,980
but it is relaxing.
It is,

1802
01:21:37,981 --> 01:21:40,220
requires an amazing focus.
Um,

1803
01:21:40,350 --> 01:21:41,183
so that's a good start.
But when you can block everything out 

1804
01:21:44,191 --> 01:21:45,024
because you say you have to block 
everything out to make a good shot on 

1805
01:21:47,180 --> 01:21:48,900
that target,
on the foam rubber,

1806
01:21:49,330 --> 01:21:51,510
the reinhart elk today.
Well,

1807
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:56,590
on an animal when the animal's moving,
there's different factors that at,

1808
01:21:56,910 --> 01:21:58,200
you know,
in line,

1809
01:21:58,350 --> 01:21:59,183
he's bugling your heart's going a 
million miles an hour and then when he 

1810
01:22:01,861 --> 01:22:04,920
can do it there and then where you take 
that up,

1811
01:22:04,921 --> 01:22:05,754
another level is hunting the mounds,
like if your sheep hunting and then you 

1812
01:22:10,171 --> 01:22:14,130
have it's such a physical and then it 
could be dangerous also.

1813
01:22:14,190 --> 01:22:15,023
So you have so many things and when that
happens on something like a sheep and 

1814
01:22:18,121 --> 01:22:22,170
the sheep mountains,
that is to me life changing.

1815
01:22:22,690 --> 01:22:25,710
I mean experiences like that have made 
me who I am.

1816
01:22:25,711 --> 01:22:27,690
When people say,
you know,

1817
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:30,390
bowhunting has made you who?
Yeah,

1818
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:35,480
I mean because coming through and crunch
time like that is more pressure and more

1819
01:22:36,241 --> 01:22:41,241
accomplishment than anything I'll ever 
do in normal life because it's just that

1820
01:22:42,151 --> 01:22:42,984
difficult.
We'll through difficult things are 

1821
01:22:44,311 --> 01:22:46,650
character,
gets challenged,

1822
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:47,680
our,
our,

1823
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:48,513
our will and our focus get tested and 
through those tests and through this 

1824
01:22:55,230 --> 01:22:58,290
very difficult task,
you learn more about yourself,

1825
01:22:58,291 --> 01:23:00,690
right?
You learn more about your ability,

1826
01:23:00,691 --> 01:23:02,500
you learn more about your faults,
you,

1827
01:23:02,550 --> 01:23:06,010
you learn about your weaknesses,
you learn about your and you learn

1828
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:08,980
how to shore up those weaknesses and get
stronger,

1829
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:10,083
and that's why people who have never 
experienced it don't understand your 

1830
01:23:12,701 --> 01:23:13,534
dedication to fitness,
don't understand your dedication to 

1831
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:17,860
making sure you're in the best possible 
shape you can be.

1832
01:23:18,100 --> 01:23:18,933
Also that your your archery practice is 
that the best it can be so that when 

1833
01:23:22,451 --> 01:23:25,330
that moment of truth arises,
you can steady your nerves.

1834
01:23:25,331 --> 01:23:28,960
You can keep it all together and you can
execute and that execution,

1835
01:23:28,961 --> 01:23:29,794
that that is an insanely difficult tasks
that very few people have to ever do 

1836
01:23:33,551 --> 01:23:38,170
anything in life that's remotely as 
difficult as shoot an Arrow at an elk.

1837
01:23:38,230 --> 01:23:39,063
It's 50 yards away and wash that arrows 
sink right into the vitals and realize 

1838
01:23:42,491 --> 01:23:46,450
that you've done it and realize that now
you have enough meat for a year for your

1839
01:23:46,451 --> 01:23:47,980
family,
one animal,

1840
01:23:48,220 --> 01:23:51,460
one animal,
and are we quantifying life?

1841
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:53,530
I mean,
are we saying that you know this,

1842
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:56,680
that all animals are worth something 
that will.

1843
01:23:56,770 --> 01:24:00,430
If that's the case,
every pasta bowl that you eat,

1844
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:03,340
you eat a bowl of pasta.
That pasta comes from grain.

1845
01:24:03,341 --> 01:24:08,341
That grain most likely was chopped from 
a field from a combine that is 100 yards

1846
01:24:08,351 --> 01:24:09,184
long that it's indiscriminate and it's 
running over everything as we were 

1847
01:24:11,351 --> 01:24:12,184
talking about running over mice and 
rabbits and fonts and ground nesting 

1848
01:24:14,981 --> 01:24:15,814
birds and anything else that might be in
its path and there's a lot of death 

1849
01:24:17,861 --> 01:24:20,500
involved in that,
so every bowl of pasta that you eat,

1850
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:24,190
even though you feel like you're 
completely immune and we're a completely

1851
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:28,120
free of any responsibility of death,
it's not true,

1852
01:24:28,690 --> 01:24:33,190
but one elk with one arrow feed you for 
a year,

1853
01:24:33,310 --> 01:24:34,340
a year,
right?

1854
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:36,430
Just I have to fucking commercial 
freezers in the back.

1855
01:24:36,431 --> 01:24:37,264
They're filled with me.
I gave Gary Clarke the musician the 

1856
01:24:38,921 --> 01:24:40,690
other day.
I came to pounds of elk,

1857
01:24:40,740 --> 01:24:41,830
like take this home and cook it.

1858
01:24:42,020 --> 01:24:42,853
They'll bird the other day said he sent 
me this text message that he made elk 

1859
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:46,650
Chili.
I gave him some advice.

1860
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:48,210
I give people meet.
I love it.

1861
01:24:48,211 --> 01:24:49,510
Love it.
Love it.

1862
01:24:49,580 --> 01:24:50,413
Yeah.
My friend Chris Ryan sent me this 

1863
01:24:52,361 --> 01:24:54,400
photograph,
or Dunkin actually sit with Chris.

1864
01:24:54,401 --> 01:24:55,234
Ryan did too,
but Duncan sent me this photograph of 

1865
01:24:56,411 --> 01:24:58,180
his,
his girlfriend made meatballs,

1866
01:24:58,300 --> 01:25:00,910
elk meat balls and they were sitting 
there eating with their friends.

1867
01:25:00,911 --> 01:25:04,780
They had a friend over for dinner with 
some meat from an animal.

1868
01:25:04,781 --> 01:25:05,700
That was,
that.

1869
01:25:05,960 --> 01:25:08,740
You're given it to them.
It's,

1870
01:25:08,741 --> 01:25:10,060
it's,
it's fantastic.

1871
01:25:10,061 --> 01:25:10,894
It's a beautiful warm feeling and it 
connects you in some weird primal way 

1872
01:25:15,310 --> 01:25:18,040
that we're immune to.
We're not getting it anymore.

1873
01:25:18,070 --> 01:25:20,000
We're not getting it.
And it,

1874
01:25:20,170 --> 01:25:22,240
for me,
people asked why?

1875
01:25:22,660 --> 01:25:25,600
Because I've always been drawn to,
to wild places.

1876
01:25:25,780 --> 01:25:28,420
Um,
big wild places and people ask,

1877
01:25:29,290 --> 01:25:30,220
how did that start?

1878
01:25:30,790 --> 01:25:31,623
For me?
How that started was I didn't come from 

1879
01:25:34,091 --> 01:25:35,370
anything.
I didn't have,

1880
01:25:35,380 --> 01:25:36,213
I didn't have anything.
I was just a guy who couldn't even 

1881
01:25:38,741 --> 01:25:42,310
afford an elk license for was $25.
I couldn't afford it,

1882
01:25:42,640 --> 01:25:45,310
but.
So I felt like,

1883
01:25:45,820 --> 01:25:47,470
um,
I don't know.

1884
01:25:47,471 --> 01:25:48,304
I didn't feel special in any way.
I didn't feel like I had any advantage 

1885
01:25:51,461 --> 01:25:53,830
over anybody.
I felt lower class essentially,

1886
01:25:54,070 --> 01:25:58,270
but in the wilderness when I went there 
could be the richest guy in the world.

1887
01:25:58,271 --> 01:25:59,950
There could be the most powerful 
businessman,

1888
01:26:00,220 --> 01:26:03,890
but if he was there and I was there,
all of a sudden the playing was equal

1889
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:07,910
and if I'm in better shape than him,
I'm above him in the mountains.

1890
01:26:08,060 --> 01:26:08,893
I can be somebody I can be,
I can be special and that's how our 

1891
01:26:13,371 --> 01:26:14,204
prepare.
And that's why I liked it back there is 

1892
01:26:15,891 --> 01:26:18,440
I didn't have to conform to society's,
well,

1893
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:22,730
this guy's an a list or you are nothing.
You know what I mean?

1894
01:26:23,030 --> 01:26:23,863
That's what it was always drawn me to 
that because it was a level playing 

1895
01:26:25,821 --> 01:26:30,080
field for me and if I came in more of 
like a beast than somebody else,

1896
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:32,660
all of a sudden I was the guy back 
there.

1897
01:26:33,030 --> 01:26:33,863
That's what I did and it was just like I
didn't have anything and I thought this 

1898
01:26:36,711 --> 01:26:40,550
is the only way I'm going to be 
achieved.

1899
01:26:40,551 --> 01:26:41,610
My dreams,
you know,

1900
01:26:41,960 --> 01:26:44,390
get to get to where I can be in control.
Well,

1901
01:26:44,391 --> 01:26:46,480
it gives you an understanding

1902
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:47,353
of that environment.
That environment really doesn't care 

1903
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:53,780
that you make six figures,
doesn't care that you drive a bmw.

1904
01:26:53,781 --> 01:26:54,890
It doesn't care that you have a nice 
house.

1905
01:26:54,910 --> 01:26:56,180
It doesn't care.
It doesn't care.

1906
01:26:56,181 --> 01:26:57,014
This is.
There's a lot of ways like I gravitate 

1907
01:26:59,871 --> 01:27:01,420
towards absolutes.
I go,

1908
01:27:01,460 --> 01:27:03,410
that's one of the reasons why I like 
martial arts.

1909
01:27:03,650 --> 01:27:07,310
It's one of the reasons I like pool,
like that ball drops in the whole.

1910
01:27:07,311 --> 01:27:08,760
It's because he made it dropped in the 
hole.

1911
01:27:09,170 --> 01:27:11,060
If you miss,
you miss and there's no if,

1912
01:27:11,061 --> 01:27:11,811
ands,
or buts about it.

1913
01:27:11,811 --> 01:27:16,760
It's an absolute thing and I think a lot
of ways hunting is similar in that way.

1914
01:27:16,940 --> 01:27:19,610
I get doesn't care.
Like if you're playing pool and you're a

1915
01:27:19,611 --> 01:27:23,000
millionaire and you're playing against a
guy who was $2 in his bank,

1916
01:27:23,030 --> 01:27:24,620
it doesn't.
The balls don't know this.

1917
01:27:24,860 --> 01:27:29,450
They don't care and it's the same in the
woods when you were out there and you're

1918
01:27:29,451 --> 01:27:30,200
in that environment.

1919
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:31,033
That is an absolute environment and 
absolute also in the fact that if you 

1920
01:27:34,380 --> 01:27:36,960
fuckin zig when you should have zagged 
and you run across a sow,

1921
01:27:36,961 --> 01:27:39,980
grizzly and her cubs and she just 
decides today's your day.

1922
01:27:40,470 --> 01:27:41,390
It doesn't,
it doesn't.

1923
01:27:41,420 --> 01:27:44,060
They don't give a fuck if you host the 
UFC,

1924
01:27:44,360 --> 01:27:46,070
that bear doesn't give a fuck.
If you know,

1925
01:27:46,071 --> 01:27:46,904
you,
uh,

1926
01:27:46,940 --> 01:27:47,773
you know,
you're the CEO of your company and 

1927
01:27:49,041 --> 01:27:50,480
you're out there.
It doesn't care.

1928
01:27:50,630 --> 01:27:53,990
No.
The wilderness is its own world.

1929
01:27:54,050 --> 01:27:55,880
It has its own,
it's an unforgiving.

1930
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:57,770
It's unforgiving.
And it's absolute.

1931
01:27:57,900 --> 01:27:58,733
Yeah.
And like that Arrow hitting the artery 

1932
01:28:01,341 --> 01:28:04,450
or hitting the vitals of,
of an elk I give you.

1933
01:28:04,640 --> 01:28:06,470
If it doesn't hit,
it doesn't hit.

1934
01:28:06,530 --> 01:28:08,600
I mean,
it's got to go where it's supposed to go

1935
01:28:08,601 --> 01:28:09,950
or are you fucked up?

1936
01:28:10,100 --> 01:28:12,390
You know,
and there there's a,

1937
01:28:12,660 --> 01:28:13,590
you know,
that is real.

1938
01:28:13,591 --> 01:28:14,240
I mean,
it's,

1939
01:28:14,240 --> 01:28:17,760
that's not just in this talk,
not talk where he zig zagged.

1940
01:28:17,950 --> 01:28:20,820
Um,
and you know,

1941
01:28:20,821 --> 01:28:25,260
Roy Roy story is a perfect example of 
that front and explained who roy is.

1942
01:28:25,590 --> 01:28:28,260
Um,
roy is,

1943
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:29,393
he's who got me started in bow hunting 
and he is the toughest man I've ever 

1944
01:28:33,601 --> 01:28:34,434
met.
I've shared more experiences with Roy 

1945
01:28:36,691 --> 01:28:39,060
and the mountains these life defining 
type experiences that,

1946
01:28:39,140 --> 01:28:41,340
that we've talked about.
And you know,

1947
01:28:41,580 --> 01:28:45,960
the bond we've created together has been
over a handful of experiences,

1948
01:28:46,110 --> 01:28:46,870
you know,
and you,

1949
01:28:46,870 --> 01:28:47,703
you realize when you're out of your 
comfort zone like that and when you're 

1950
01:28:50,191 --> 01:28:54,630
both so committed to a pursuit,
those bonds formed quickly,

1951
01:28:54,660 --> 01:28:57,420
you know.
And so we've formed a strong bond over a

1952
01:28:57,421 --> 01:29:00,240
handful of experiences over a couple of 
years will really.

1953
01:29:00,241 --> 01:29:01,530
And I,
um,

1954
01:29:02,120 --> 01:29:03,480
you know,
we went to high school together,

1955
01:29:03,510 --> 01:29:06,660
we started bowhunting as you know,
I think 18,

1956
01:29:06,661 --> 01:29:10,830
19 years old and had hundreds of 
experiences,

1957
01:29:10,831 --> 01:29:11,664
life changing life,
defining experiences together over the 

1958
01:29:15,750 --> 01:29:15,750
year.

1959
01:29:15,750 --> 01:29:20,260
So our bond naturally was like brothers 
and um,

1960
01:29:20,930 --> 01:29:21,780
you know,
he,

1961
01:29:22,020 --> 01:29:25,230
he was,
when everybody doubted me,

1962
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:29,880
when I was growing up and doubted my 
dream of ever becoming anything he never

1963
01:29:29,881 --> 01:29:31,170
did.
He was always,

1964
01:29:32,040 --> 01:29:34,740
he was always the guy that believed in 
me.

1965
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:37,590
Well,
this year of sheep hunting,

1966
01:29:37,950 --> 01:29:38,783
he was up,
she punted where we had sheep hunted 

1967
01:29:40,891 --> 01:29:42,990
before together and I killed a ram and 
it was,

1968
01:29:42,991 --> 01:29:43,824
you know,
it's a,

1969
01:29:44,310 --> 01:29:46,020
it's a tough,
difficult,

1970
01:29:46,021 --> 01:29:46,854
dangerous hunt and he,
but he's more prepared or he was more 

1971
01:29:50,131 --> 01:29:52,290
prepared for hunting like that than 
anybody in the world.

1972
01:29:52,291 --> 01:29:53,124
He's done it.
He's done it as much as anyone that I 

1973
01:29:55,291 --> 01:29:58,080
know and I've been successful.
I think he's killed,

1974
01:29:58,140 --> 01:30:03,140
had killed nine rams and he one misstep.
He fell and died,

1975
01:30:04,390 --> 01:30:05,910
um,
prime of his life,

1976
01:30:05,940 --> 01:30:09,780
essentially 49 years old.
I'm just,

1977
01:30:10,590 --> 01:30:13,050
you know,
as a father,

1978
01:30:13,051 --> 01:30:15,060
husband,
three kids,

1979
01:30:15,330 --> 01:30:20,330
somebody who even the toughest Alaska 
hunters looked up to one step gone.

1980
01:30:23,310 --> 01:30:25,050
And that's,
you know,

1981
01:30:25,350 --> 01:30:26,031
that's.
So,

1982
01:30:26,031 --> 01:30:28,310
it's not just talk.
When you say zig zagged,

1983
01:30:28,311 --> 01:30:30,360
there's risk.
But that's,

1984
01:30:30,660 --> 01:30:32,250
I mean,
if you're going to it,

1985
01:30:32,670 --> 01:30:36,090
it just puts everything in perspective.
That's the allure to it.

1986
01:30:36,091 --> 01:30:39,530
Because I can speak for Roy and I 
because I know we,

1987
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:40,393
we always have known about the risks.
That was part of the draw is we wanted 

1988
01:30:45,061 --> 01:30:50,010
to go where nobody else wanted to go or 
do things that nobody else wanted to do.

1989
01:30:50,011 --> 01:30:52,530
That was the only thing that made us 
different and it goes back.

1990
01:30:53,220 --> 01:30:54,300
That made us different.
That's,

1991
01:30:54,350 --> 01:30:57,100
and it goes back to the level,
the playing field.

1992
01:30:57,360 --> 01:30:58,410
Well,
we felt like,

1993
01:30:58,560 --> 01:30:59,393
well,
if we would go and do the hardest hunts 

1994
01:31:00,541 --> 01:31:03,870
and the toughest conditions,
nobody else would want to do that,

1995
01:31:03,871 --> 01:31:04,704
but we would,
all of a sudden we were calling the 

1996
01:31:06,781 --> 01:31:09,080
shots,
we don't call the shots,

1997
01:31:09,100 --> 01:31:11,010
the mountain calls,
the shots and all that.

1998
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:12,113
That hunt the mountain.
One at Roy fell and he died and it's a 

1999
01:31:17,510 --> 01:31:18,930
file 700 feet,
right?

2000
01:31:18,990 --> 01:31:19,651
Yeah,
yeah.

2001
01:31:19,651 --> 01:31:20,700
It's uh,
you know,

2002
01:31:20,701 --> 01:31:25,701
that where he fell just tough,
unforgiving sheep country.

2003
01:31:26,100 --> 01:31:27,570
And um,
you know,

2004
01:31:27,571 --> 01:31:30,000
once you,
once you start going there,

2005
01:31:30,270 --> 01:31:32,280
you're not going to stop.
And um,

2006
01:31:32,760 --> 01:31:35,520
it's one of the most dangerous hunts 
sheep.

2007
01:31:35,521 --> 01:31:36,450
Yeah.
Yeah.

2008
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:38,280
It's uh,
you know,

2009
01:31:39,700 --> 01:31:40,533
on that hunt specifically,
they give 100 tags and a lot of times 

2010
01:31:44,071 --> 01:31:44,904
there's this one sheep killed.
It's that difficult in and I think 40 

2011
01:31:48,871 --> 01:31:49,704
percent of the people never even go 
because of the weather because of the 

2012
01:31:51,841 --> 01:31:52,674
conditions because it's so hard.
So they draw the tag and don't even get 

2013
01:31:55,381 --> 01:31:56,720
up the hill.
It wasn't a.

2014
01:31:56,740 --> 01:31:59,320
That was the case with you when you went
up there?

2015
01:31:59,350 --> 01:32:00,100
Grizzly hunting,

2016
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:01,870
you were supposed to go sheep hunting as
well,

2017
01:32:01,871 --> 01:32:02,710
right?
Yeah.

2018
01:32:02,770 --> 01:32:04,340
Well now it's moose hunting,
Moose Hunt.

2019
01:32:04,370 --> 01:32:07,180
We were going to do a moose sheep Combo,
but there's so much.

2020
01:32:07,181 --> 01:32:08,014
No,
we couldn't even get to sheep country 

2021
01:32:09,160 --> 01:32:12,310
and that was a plan.
We're going to go sheep hunting.

2022
01:32:12,340 --> 01:32:13,990
And that was with Roy.
That was with Roy.

2023
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:15,280
Right.
So we had,

2024
01:32:15,460 --> 01:32:16,293
you know,
an amazing moose hunt together and I 

2025
01:32:18,191 --> 01:32:21,070
killed a nice big bowl.
Um,

2026
01:32:21,071 --> 01:32:25,360
we just had just a,
just another epic adventure,

2027
01:32:25,420 --> 01:32:26,680
something,
you know,

2028
01:32:26,681 --> 01:32:27,514
a haunt that maybe a handful of people 
would want to do because we were so far 

2029
01:32:30,911 --> 01:32:32,160
back,
you know,

2030
01:32:32,170 --> 01:32:37,170
miles back and had to haul a moose out 
over a mountain in the snow.

2031
01:32:37,480 --> 01:32:39,040
A very,
very,

2032
01:32:39,250 --> 01:32:40,360
very difficult.
Huh.

2033
01:32:40,450 --> 01:32:42,370
But the ones,
it was just,

2034
01:32:42,690 --> 01:32:44,890
it was perfect because it's our last 
hunt together.

2035
01:32:45,070 --> 01:32:50,020
He died two weeks later and that hunt 
and capsulated everything about us,

2036
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:50,980
it was just hard.

2037
01:32:51,010 --> 01:32:54,220
It was miserable and it was rewarding.
And,

2038
01:32:54,670 --> 01:32:55,503
and you know,
we achieved success were not very many 

2039
01:32:58,271 --> 01:33:00,940
people would have and we did it together
and uh,

2040
01:33:02,170 --> 01:33:03,070
yeah,
I mean,

2041
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:05,680
and then two weeks later,
years was his sheep hunting.

2042
01:33:06,280 --> 01:33:07,113
There was an iconic photo that I think 
it was forever going to define you from 

2043
01:33:11,051 --> 01:33:11,884
that hunt with you with a big cut in 
your face and blood streaming down your 

2044
01:33:14,501 --> 01:33:16,810
face.
And you sent it to me while you were out

2045
01:33:16,811 --> 01:33:17,460
there.
Yeah.

2046
01:33:17,460 --> 01:33:18,970
You were,
you're saying we haven't,

2047
01:33:19,150 --> 01:33:20,610
we haven't gotten one yet.
Yeah.

2048
01:33:20,710 --> 01:33:21,543
We're out here hustling.
And there's this photo of you looking 

2049
01:33:25,210 --> 01:33:28,390
grizzled is fuck with blood coming down 
your face.

2050
01:33:28,420 --> 01:33:30,140
Snow in the background.
Yeah.

2051
01:33:30,250 --> 01:33:31,083
And I'm like,
uh,

2052
01:33:31,150 --> 01:33:32,290
yeah,
that's,

2053
01:33:32,620 --> 01:33:35,920
that's Cameron Hanes.
It is.

2054
01:33:35,921 --> 01:33:36,754
Because in enrolling it would,
we would always say we can make an easy 

2055
01:33:40,631 --> 01:33:43,180
hunt hard because we want it to be hard.

2056
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:47,680
But you went into an area where very few
people were having success and even with

2057
01:33:47,681 --> 01:33:49,420
rifles,
you're going deep,

2058
01:33:49,510 --> 01:33:51,820
deep into area.
It was a rifle area,

2059
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:52,833
so that means you have.
Hunter had a different size of animal 

2060
01:33:56,141 --> 01:33:59,740
that was legal if you're hunting with a.
So if you're hunting in this area,

2061
01:33:59,741 --> 01:34:02,440
it was a rifle area,
had to be a little bigger so I had to be

2062
01:34:02,441 --> 01:34:04,840
15 inches wide but had to have for Brow 
Tine switch.

2063
01:34:05,050 --> 01:34:06,220
So you're,
you're,

2064
01:34:06,790 --> 01:34:07,623
you're making it harder.
So we were there and there in the rifle 

2065
01:34:09,581 --> 01:34:11,740
area and we got it done.
And it was,

2066
01:34:11,950 --> 01:34:15,160
it was the hunt that it was a hunt that 
that's what we love.

2067
01:34:15,161 --> 01:34:18,700
We loved hard.
We just loved the test.

2068
01:34:18,760 --> 01:34:19,593
No.
When you go out there and there's a 

2069
01:34:19,871 --> 01:34:22,510
bowhunter have different standards in a 
rifle hunter.

2070
01:34:22,520 --> 01:34:23,353
Like if you were there with a rifle,
would you have to have shot a bigger 

2071
01:34:25,061 --> 01:34:25,480
bowl?

2072
01:34:25,480 --> 01:34:26,230
No,
that was I,

2073
01:34:26,230 --> 01:34:28,450
I went to the bigger area.
I went to the big area.

2074
01:34:28,690 --> 01:34:30,370
So in,
in the bowl area,

2075
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:34,000
it only has to have three brown times 
the Moose in the rifle or it had to have

2076
01:34:34,001 --> 01:34:35,440
four,
so I had to find one with four.

2077
01:34:35,441 --> 01:34:37,220
Well mine had five on one side for him 
and another,

2078
01:34:37,230 --> 01:34:38,950
so it was good and it was over 50 inches
wide,

2079
01:34:38,951 --> 01:34:39,784
so as it was league all the way around.
But if I would've just focused on the 

2080
01:34:42,090 --> 01:34:42,923
area,
it could have been a lesser bullet in 

2081
01:34:44,441 --> 01:34:46,420
regard to time.
But uh,

2082
01:34:46,810 --> 01:34:51,220
and they do this to make sure again,
that the mature animals are harvested so

2083
01:34:51,221 --> 01:34:52,054
that the younger animals can breed.
And so this is all calculated by 

2084
01:34:55,241 --> 01:34:58,040
wildlife biologists to make sure that 
they have healthy populations

2085
01:34:58,040 --> 01:34:58,873
of these animals.
Just a mature bull has served his 

2086
01:35:01,731 --> 01:35:03,200
purpose,
so to speak.

2087
01:35:03,230 --> 01:35:07,070
He's bred the animals over the years.
He's probably on the decline,

2088
01:35:07,250 --> 01:35:10,040
so it's a perfect time to take them out.
So that's not what people,

2089
01:35:10,070 --> 01:35:12,440
you know,
people associated almost instantly with,

2090
01:35:12,470 --> 01:35:14,560
oh,
you're full control of your own and the,

2091
01:35:14,561 --> 01:35:16,010
Oh,
you just want a bigger rack.

2092
01:35:16,250 --> 01:35:21,230
But they do that specifically because 
it's for the health of the population of

2093
01:35:21,231 --> 01:35:22,140
these animals.
Yeah,

2094
01:35:22,190 --> 01:35:23,210
I mean we,
you know,

2095
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:24,673
we,
we care about the animals we care about 

2096
01:35:26,030 --> 01:35:31,030
and do like to kill a big animal,
but there's dual purpose.

2097
01:35:31,280 --> 01:35:34,670
We want to kill a big animal because 
it's a,

2098
01:35:35,060 --> 01:35:36,350
it's awesome.
It's hard,

2099
01:35:36,890 --> 01:35:38,000
it's hard,
they're smart,

2100
01:35:38,001 --> 01:35:40,130
they're wiser and older,
mature animals,

2101
01:35:40,131 --> 01:35:42,710
especially with the bow.
So that's hard to do.

2102
01:35:42,770 --> 01:35:46,620
And then also on the dual purpose side 
is it helps the health,

2103
01:35:46,990 --> 01:35:47,960
the health of the herd.

2104
01:35:48,200 --> 01:35:49,430
So we're,
you know,

2105
01:35:49,460 --> 01:35:51,830
we're doing the best we can,
but most of all,

2106
01:35:51,900 --> 01:35:52,280
uh,
you know,

2107
01:35:52,280 --> 01:35:53,410
when you go back to,
uh,

2108
01:35:53,490 --> 01:35:56,060
to bow hunting in general is just for 
me,

2109
01:35:56,061 --> 01:35:56,894
it's just the tests,
the ultimate test is something that's 

2110
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:00,740
very hard.
And that's the draw.

2111
01:36:01,010 --> 01:36:01,843
Yeah.
And that,

2112
01:36:02,030 --> 01:36:07,030
that hunt also really exemplifies why 
your hard work is so important.

2113
01:36:07,880 --> 01:36:10,040
First of all,
you shot the moose at 90 yards,

2114
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:11,233
which is an incredibly.
We were shooting today at 45 yards and 

2115
01:36:13,731 --> 01:36:14,720
as far as,
fuck,

2116
01:36:14,840 --> 01:36:17,630
I never said how far I shot that Moose.
I just tell people.

2117
01:36:17,660 --> 01:36:18,970
Sorry,
I'll listen to,

2118
01:36:19,040 --> 01:36:20,350
I mean,
you know Tim Gillingham,

2119
01:36:20,351 --> 01:36:21,184
we're talking about on the Gritty Bowman
podcasts who is a world champion Archer 

2120
01:36:23,601 --> 01:36:28,100
who was talking about routinely shooting
animals over a hundred yards and then he

2121
01:36:28,130 --> 01:36:28,963
does this because he's a world champion 
Archer and he can do that when you're 

2122
01:36:32,091 --> 01:36:32,924
shooting a Moose,
the distance that you can shoot a moose 

2123
01:36:34,941 --> 01:36:38,810
versus a guy like me who by the way I 
still shoot every day but I just,

2124
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:39,710
I can't do that.

2125
01:36:39,710 --> 01:36:42,140
I'm not,
it's not an ethical distance for me,

2126
01:36:42,141 --> 01:36:45,860
but it is for you and to have to haul 
that animal out.

2127
01:36:46,070 --> 01:36:50,320
Sorry to blow up your spot on the yard.
I thought you already told people but it

2128
01:36:50,330 --> 01:36:51,560
was the perfect shot,
right?

2129
01:36:51,561 --> 01:36:53,930
I mean,
but that's a,

2130
01:36:53,931 --> 01:36:56,270
that's a funny area with,
with a shooting.

2131
01:36:56,271 --> 01:36:58,940
Something like a rifle shot at 91st 
meal,

2132
01:36:58,950 --> 01:37:01,970
deer mule deer right there to your left.
That was 200 yards.

2133
01:37:02,130 --> 01:37:03,890
It was the first time I ever pull the 
trigger on anything.

2134
01:37:03,920 --> 01:37:04,910
Yeah.
Anything.

2135
01:37:05,060 --> 01:37:06,540
Right.
And that was 200 years,

2136
01:37:06,541 --> 01:37:08,180
but of the rifle,
that's normal.

2137
01:37:08,210 --> 01:37:09,830
You get,
you get arrested with a rifle,

2138
01:37:09,831 --> 01:37:14,330
you just thrown on my stomach.
The whole thing was perfect.

2139
01:37:14,331 --> 01:37:16,850
Yeah,
I mean the rifle is a tool.

2140
01:37:17,210 --> 01:37:19,070
You just let her perform.
It's going to work,

2141
01:37:19,250 --> 01:37:21,050
you know,
the bow hunt with a bow.

2142
01:37:21,051 --> 01:37:23,240
It's just a lot of,
a lot of variables.

2143
01:37:23,390 --> 01:37:28,390
So all of your preparation is shooting 
every day for years and decades really.

2144
01:37:29,390 --> 01:37:32,660
And then also your physical fitness to 
be able to pack out.

2145
01:37:33,250 --> 01:37:36,590
I mean a moose is how big,
how many pounds of that thing way.

2146
01:37:36,650 --> 01:37:41,180
We had about 600 pounds of meat.
Just the meat,

2147
01:37:41,420 --> 01:37:42,380
just the meat.
I mean,

2148
01:37:42,381 --> 01:37:44,150
how much did the animal way?
Oh,

2149
01:37:44,810 --> 01:37:46,850
I dunno over.
I mean 1200 pounds.

2150
01:37:46,851 --> 01:37:48,110
Probably a thousand.
I don't know.

2151
01:37:48,150 --> 01:37:50,480
It's an enormous,
enormous animal.

2152
01:37:50,750 --> 01:37:52,400
Until you see one,
like in,

2153
01:37:52,401 --> 01:37:55,010
you're there physically next to it,
you don't realize.

2154
01:37:55,190 --> 01:37:55,980
No,
it

2155
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:57,300
took us hours to break,
you know,

2156
01:37:57,301 --> 01:37:58,230
I killed it.
Um,

2157
01:37:58,450 --> 01:38:02,070
it was in the evening and uh,
Roy and I,

2158
01:38:02,071 --> 01:38:03,680
we had cameraman there,
but they ended up,

2159
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:07,140
they found a little bit of the,
the process of breaking it down.

2160
01:38:07,180 --> 01:38:11,760
Then they headed back to the spike camp 
in a row and I stayed there,

2161
01:38:11,880 --> 01:38:16,440
which we like just doing it by ourselves
back there together,

2162
01:38:16,950 --> 01:38:21,950
saying in just saying he would always 
say,

2163
01:38:22,210 --> 01:38:23,680
I don't really,
uh,

2164
01:38:23,790 --> 01:38:26,940
what kind of stuff would be saying no 
country girl Shaker for me.

2165
01:38:26,941 --> 01:38:29,820
Little Luke Bryan,
maybe little little,

2166
01:38:29,821 --> 01:38:31,170
uh,
Lady Gaga.

2167
01:38:31,290 --> 01:38:32,520
I.
Oh God,

2168
01:38:32,521 --> 01:38:33,200
Yeah.
He,

2169
01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:35,820
he,
he was a well versed,

2170
01:38:36,570 --> 01:38:40,470
terrible singer,
but it was,

2171
01:38:40,520 --> 01:38:41,970
it's just what we did,
right.

2172
01:38:42,040 --> 01:38:44,520
It was also part of the part of the 
deal.

2173
01:38:44,610 --> 01:38:46,140
You were happy.
Oh,

2174
01:38:46,200 --> 01:38:48,240
successful hunt.
It was,

2175
01:38:48,450 --> 01:38:50,280
you know,
God,

2176
01:38:50,340 --> 01:38:51,173
you know,
I'm just gonna I'm gonna miss those 

2177
01:38:54,241 --> 01:38:55,074
times with him because uh,
it's just hard knowing that the journey 

2178
01:39:01,291 --> 01:39:02,820
we'd been through together.

2179
01:39:03,300 --> 01:39:06,630
That's why it's so appreciated.
And you know,

2180
01:39:07,260 --> 01:39:08,790
who else?
No,

2181
01:39:08,820 --> 01:39:11,580
there's another example.
We hunted this year and hunted the Brown

2182
01:39:11,581 --> 01:39:14,190
bear together and uh,
he,

2183
01:39:14,550 --> 01:39:15,450
he,
uh,

2184
01:39:15,720 --> 01:39:16,553
I killed this bear.
The sow went over and was attacking the 

2185
01:39:20,791 --> 01:39:22,500
corpse of the bear,
but the bear died.

2186
01:39:22,770 --> 01:39:25,110
She didn't know what was going on.
She smelled blood.

2187
01:39:25,111 --> 01:39:26,010
Just went crazy.
The,

2188
01:39:26,180 --> 01:39:29,910
these brown bear are there,
big predators.

2189
01:39:29,940 --> 01:39:33,060
And something goes in their head,
it's going to have an issue.

2190
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:36,330
So she hurt.
When I shot the bore,

2191
01:39:37,110 --> 01:39:40,350
it made a noise.
It sorta ran towards her.

2192
01:39:40,680 --> 01:39:43,380
She stood up,
didn't know what was going on,

2193
01:39:44,310 --> 01:39:47,160
knew he'd made this noise.
So she ran towards where he was.

2194
01:39:47,610 --> 01:39:49,890
Well,
as soon as she hit his path,

2195
01:39:49,891 --> 01:39:52,260
she smelled the blood from where my 
arrow past thrown.

2196
01:39:52,770 --> 01:39:54,900
So she tracked him by the blood,
just basically running,

2197
01:39:54,901 --> 01:39:55,890
smelling blood,
blood,

2198
01:39:55,891 --> 01:39:56,430
blood.

2199
01:39:56,430 --> 01:39:59,550
She got to him and he had died already.
She started attacking him.

2200
01:40:00,270 --> 01:40:01,610
This is just what they do.
These are,

2201
01:40:01,710 --> 01:40:03,300
you know,
these aren't crying,

2202
01:40:03,480 --> 01:40:05,370
hugging bear.
And uh,

2203
01:40:06,180 --> 01:40:08,100
so she's gone and I'm,
I'm with rolling on.

2204
01:40:08,130 --> 01:40:10,830
Like I said,
she's turned on my bed and I'm like,

2205
01:40:11,230 --> 01:40:13,610
God my bear.
And I'm yelling to her.

2206
01:40:13,611 --> 01:40:14,610
I'm like,
you know,

2207
01:40:14,710 --> 01:40:16,710
so I tell Roy on,
like I said,

2208
01:40:16,810 --> 01:40:17,700
we've got to get up.
I said,

2209
01:40:17,701 --> 01:40:19,680
shoot out there.
So he shoots boom.

2210
01:40:20,160 --> 01:40:23,520
And she's like,
didn't even know he didn't shoot at her.

2211
01:40:23,550 --> 01:40:25,680
He was making the noise,
just a scare.

2212
01:40:25,890 --> 01:40:26,723
Nothing.
Now I'm like,

2213
01:40:26,820 --> 01:40:28,410
Hey,
get off that there.

2214
01:40:28,590 --> 01:40:31,350
And she looked up and then she liked,
saw us,

2215
01:40:31,530 --> 01:40:33,660
all of a sudden here she comes,
sprinting,

2216
01:40:33,930 --> 01:40:35,820
and it was like,
what is going on?

2217
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:38,280
And uh,
she's like a blood friends.

2218
01:40:38,281 --> 01:40:39,000
Yeah,
just,

2219
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:39,833
it was so much going on at one time and 
then it got something triggered in her 

2220
01:40:43,921 --> 01:40:47,250
head and she was just crazy.

2221
01:40:47,550 --> 01:40:50,070
So here she comes and I killed my bears 
in a creek.

2222
01:40:50,730 --> 01:40:51,563
She got to the creek and Roy says,
he says if she doesn't stop long enough 

2223
01:40:54,821 --> 01:40:55,930
to shooter.
And I said,

2224
01:40:55,990 --> 01:40:56,823
yeah.
So she comes up to our side of the 

2225
01:40:58,541 --> 01:40:59,374
creek.
Now I have an arrow knocked and you 

2226
01:41:00,601 --> 01:41:01,434
know,
I don't know what I'm going to do with 

2227
01:41:01,871 --> 01:41:02,561
an Arrow,
but it's,

2228
01:41:02,561 --> 01:41:04,140
I don't have,
I never pack a gun.

2229
01:41:04,141 --> 01:41:07,480
So I just had my bow and he had,
he had the gun,

2230
01:41:07,510 --> 01:41:11,960
she stands up at 20 yards away and we're
standing there and it's in,

2231
01:41:12,010 --> 01:41:13,870
it's a standoff.
And so we think,

2232
01:41:14,260 --> 01:41:15,460
well,
she stood up,

2233
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:17,740
she going to see what's going on.
Um,

2234
01:41:18,030 --> 01:41:20,530
there was three of us standing there and
she's going to say,

2235
01:41:20,540 --> 01:41:22,690
okay,
dropped down and leave.

2236
01:41:23,200 --> 01:41:24,490
So we're like,
get out of here.

2237
01:41:24,790 --> 01:41:25,623
And uh,
she drops down bee line right towards 

2238
01:41:28,270 --> 01:41:32,470
this charging and so roy boom,
and he,

2239
01:41:32,471 --> 01:41:34,330
uh,
he drops her,

2240
01:41:34,650 --> 01:41:36,130
you know,
one shot made a good shot.

2241
01:41:36,130 --> 01:41:36,963
He hit like Mr. Head,
but hit like right here and it was 

2242
01:41:39,071 --> 01:41:41,310
folded or right there.
And it was,

2243
01:41:41,350 --> 01:41:44,970
what the law stands out for me is that,
um,

2244
01:41:45,940 --> 01:41:48,650
you know,
we were out,

2245
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:53,080
we were never worried about our lives 
were at stake,

2246
01:41:53,081 --> 01:41:54,970
were never worried about.
And you know,

2247
01:41:54,971 --> 01:41:57,310
like maybe a typical reaction to be 
like,

2248
01:41:57,670 --> 01:41:58,503
oh my God,
we could have died or something like 

2249
01:41:59,471 --> 01:42:00,910
that.
I,

2250
01:42:01,210 --> 01:42:04,780
I was just like,
I can just because I'm like,

2251
01:42:04,840 --> 01:42:09,580
I was mad she did that and required Roy 
to act,

2252
01:42:09,830 --> 01:42:10,870
you know.
So I was just,

2253
01:42:10,930 --> 01:42:12,880
I cussed and he's like,
he's like,

2254
01:42:12,881 --> 01:42:14,020
dude,
I had to.

2255
01:42:14,410 --> 01:42:16,990
And uh,
so we were worried about ourselves.

2256
01:42:17,010 --> 01:42:17,843
We were just,
we didn't want to have to kill another 

2257
01:42:18,521 --> 01:42:22,690
bear and we weren't nervous about the 
situation.

2258
01:42:22,990 --> 01:42:23,741
And I'm like,
I said,

2259
01:42:23,741 --> 01:42:25,420
I know.
And it was like,

2260
01:42:25,870 --> 01:42:28,900
where else am I going to have somebody 
that's on that same page with me that,

2261
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:29,793
that's common,
that situation and not see their life 

2262
01:42:31,631 --> 01:42:34,530
flash before their eyes,
just do what you have to do to,

2263
01:42:34,840 --> 01:42:36,730
to stop the risk.

2264
01:42:37,390 --> 01:42:38,223
That's never going to happen.
I'm never going to have somebody like 

2265
01:42:40,271 --> 01:42:43,930
that in my life again.
And I think about we were,

2266
01:42:44,410 --> 01:42:45,300
you know,
we,

2267
01:42:45,310 --> 01:42:47,800
we knew the risk,
we're involved in everything that we did

2268
01:42:47,801 --> 01:42:50,340
and we embraced it and we're fine with 
it and it,

2269
01:42:50,410 --> 01:42:51,243
and it didn't consume us or anything.
And that's what I'm going to miss is 

2270
01:42:55,480 --> 01:43:00,190
having somebody.
So on my same page that I can trust like

2271
01:43:00,191 --> 01:43:01,024
that,
you know,

2272
01:43:01,210 --> 01:43:02,043
Roy was about,
you'd have to have someone who's 

2273
01:43:03,580 --> 01:43:06,600
experienced that as many times as Roy 
has had where it was,

2274
01:43:06,790 --> 01:43:08,920
he knew exactly what he had to do in 
that moment.

2275
01:43:08,980 --> 01:43:09,880
Yeah,
he did.

2276
01:43:09,881 --> 01:43:12,430
And he said,
people know what they have to do.

2277
01:43:12,550 --> 01:43:14,710
It's,
it's executing.

2278
01:43:14,890 --> 01:43:16,810
That is what's hard,
you know.

2279
01:43:16,811 --> 01:43:17,590
And,
uh,

2280
01:43:17,590 --> 01:43:20,500
so knowing what it takes,
not panicking,

2281
01:43:20,740 --> 01:43:24,100
being in control and then getting the 
job done with one shot,

2282
01:43:25,090 --> 01:43:30,090
very rare and he was so roy in those 
situations was,

2283
01:43:32,040 --> 01:43:33,820
as you know,
I don't know everybody,

2284
01:43:33,821 --> 01:43:34,654
I haven't been with everybody,
but I would say he's as good as anybody 

2285
01:43:37,481 --> 01:43:39,370
that I know of,
you know,

2286
01:43:39,371 --> 01:43:40,750
and uh,
um,

2287
01:43:41,560 --> 01:43:43,120
that's why,
you know,

2288
01:43:43,121 --> 01:43:46,570
when he fell and I got the news that he 
fell and died.

2289
01:43:48,010 --> 01:43:48,843
I mean,
I could,

2290
01:43:49,150 --> 01:43:51,130
I could believe it,
I guess,

2291
01:43:51,680 --> 01:43:54,350
but I was mad and I'm still mad.
Um,

2292
01:43:54,370 --> 01:43:56,670
and I know everything happens for a 
reason and I know,

2293
01:43:57,010 --> 01:43:57,740
you know,
he has,

2294
01:43:57,740 --> 01:44:00,240
he has a lot of faith and I know,
you know,

2295
01:44:00,770 --> 01:44:04,370
we want to think everything's gonna be 
okay and we'll see each other again.

2296
01:44:04,371 --> 01:44:07,910
I know all that,
but it still makes me mad,

2297
01:44:08,870 --> 01:44:11,870
um,
because,

2298
01:44:13,070 --> 01:44:13,903
you know,
we missed or we missed out on a lot of 

2299
01:44:17,960 --> 01:44:18,793
experiences we'd still love to have.
And we talked about and we were just 

2300
01:44:21,891 --> 01:44:23,390
like,
we had these big,

2301
01:44:23,690 --> 01:44:28,550
big goals and big dreams.
And I'm mad that that's gone.

2302
01:44:29,090 --> 01:44:33,710
So it's completely,
it's not,

2303
01:44:33,730 --> 01:44:36,110
it's not just understandable,
it's,

2304
01:44:36,111 --> 01:44:36,944
um,
it's something that very few people 

2305
01:44:37,641 --> 01:44:38,474
could probably relate to the kind of 
intimate friendship that you would have 

2306
01:44:40,911 --> 01:44:43,970
with someone who's experienced those 
kinds of hunts.

2307
01:44:44,060 --> 01:44:44,893
It's been in the,
in the wilderness that's done like that 

2308
01:44:47,301 --> 01:44:50,630
Moose hunt that you were talking about 
when you guys were deep,

2309
01:44:50,631 --> 01:44:54,440
deep in the,
in the wilderness like that.

2310
01:44:55,200 --> 01:44:58,790
It's,
it's something that very few people will

2311
01:44:58,791 --> 01:44:59,624
ever.
Very few people ever experienced that 

2312
01:45:02,270 --> 01:45:03,103
kind of danger,
that kind of an intimate moment in the 

2313
01:45:05,721 --> 01:45:06,554
wilderness.
Just that connection to the wild that 

2314
01:45:09,471 --> 01:45:10,610
you guys had together.

2315
01:45:10,760 --> 01:45:13,550
Right?
And so the whole point,

2316
01:45:13,610 --> 01:45:16,520
I guess with all that is it's people 
say,

2317
01:45:16,521 --> 01:45:17,354
well,
you just,

2318
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:18,913
your murderous or you want to kill such 
a small part of what me and really 

2319
01:45:22,731 --> 01:45:26,750
experienced together.
The kills were.

2320
01:45:27,380 --> 01:45:30,290
I mean they were,
we achieved our goal.

2321
01:45:30,890 --> 01:45:33,050
That was it.
It was the journey.

2322
01:45:33,140 --> 01:45:35,330
It was the Brotherhood.
It was,

2323
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:36,800
you know,
growing up.

2324
01:45:37,070 --> 01:45:39,920
And that's what,
that's what hunting is.

2325
01:45:39,980 --> 01:45:41,870
It's not just you're out killing,
it's,

2326
01:45:41,871 --> 01:45:42,704
you're experiencing nature,
its most brutal or it's most rewarding 

2327
01:45:48,500 --> 01:45:51,290
or the entire gamut.
And when,

2328
01:45:51,530 --> 01:45:54,300
when that makes you who you are,
um,

2329
01:45:54,470 --> 01:45:56,810
it's powerful and that's,
you know,

2330
01:45:56,840 --> 01:45:57,490
that's hunting

2331
01:45:57,490 --> 01:45:59,900
was to us.
Yeah.

2332
01:45:59,910 --> 01:46:01,500
There's a lot of people that are 
listening to this.

2333
01:46:01,501 --> 01:46:03,060
I'm sure they're like,
well,

2334
01:46:03,720 --> 01:46:05,520
you know,
why is that?

2335
01:46:05,521 --> 01:46:06,354
Why should you feel any worse for your 
friend than we should for the animals 

2336
01:46:10,261 --> 01:46:11,850
that you killed?
You know,

2337
01:46:11,851 --> 01:46:16,851
there's a lot of people that they sort 
of connect animals almost with people in

2338
01:46:17,611 --> 01:46:20,400
a way or maybe even better than people 
in a way.

2339
01:46:20,580 --> 01:46:21,413
Maybe it's this and I think that's a 
good part of this disconnect that we're 

2340
01:46:24,571 --> 01:46:25,404
talking about.
These people that they don't experience 

2341
01:46:26,731 --> 01:46:28,500
these,
these moments.

2342
01:46:29,150 --> 01:46:31,890
They don't,
they don't know anybody like that.

2343
01:46:31,920 --> 01:46:32,753
They don't have a friendship with 
someone like Roy that they haven't had 

2344
01:46:35,011 --> 01:46:39,050
these experiences like you did with him.
Yeah.

2345
01:46:39,100 --> 01:46:39,933
It's,
um,

2346
01:46:40,460 --> 01:46:41,200
I mean,
what you said,

2347
01:46:41,200 --> 01:46:43,380
you sent me the text,
I'm sorry to interrupt you,

2348
01:46:43,381 --> 01:46:45,630
but you sent me the text when,
when he died.

2349
01:46:45,720 --> 01:46:49,050
And I knew,
I knew that that had to be

2350
01:46:50,610 --> 01:46:55,610
devastating to his still is.
Um,

2351
01:46:57,540 --> 01:46:58,230
yeah,
I,

2352
01:46:58,230 --> 01:47:00,750
I mean,
I don't think there's a,

2353
01:47:01,110 --> 01:47:03,420
there's very few men like Roy,
uh,

2354
01:47:03,450 --> 01:47:06,330
he was,
he was a capable,

2355
01:47:06,480 --> 01:47:08,070
um,
he was,

2356
01:47:08,071 --> 01:47:10,410
uh,
just somebody you could count on,

2357
01:47:10,470 --> 01:47:15,470
anybody could count on and I'm just,
you know,

2358
01:47:15,900 --> 01:47:18,900
tough to replace what's very easy to get
by in this world today.

2359
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:20,513
It's very easy to get by without being 
that kind of a person and it's very 

2360
01:47:22,921 --> 01:47:23,754
difficult to become that kind of a 
person to always make the right 

2361
01:47:26,431 --> 01:47:28,380
decisions,
to always push ahead,

2362
01:47:28,680 --> 01:47:30,990
to always,
always show character.

2363
01:47:31,290 --> 01:47:34,110
To always be someone that you can count 
on is hard.

2364
01:47:34,280 --> 01:47:35,040
It,
yeah,

2365
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:38,460
it's a society today is too easy,
I believe.

2366
01:47:38,580 --> 01:47:40,040
And so,
um,

2367
01:47:40,230 --> 01:47:41,063
that's why I think that's kind of the 
draw for me to pushing myself the way I 

2368
01:47:44,761 --> 01:47:46,290
do physically,
mentally.

2369
01:47:46,650 --> 01:47:48,780
I don't,
I don't like if something's easy,

2370
01:47:48,840 --> 01:47:50,490
I don't,
I'm not attracted to it.

2371
01:47:50,700 --> 01:47:51,780
I'll,
I'll want to,

2372
01:47:51,930 --> 01:47:54,000
I want to be hard.
I want it to be hard.

2373
01:47:54,001 --> 01:47:56,790
I want it to be difficult.
And um,

2374
01:47:56,940 --> 01:47:57,773
because society makes us weak,
it makes us feel entitled and I don't 

2375
01:48:02,281 --> 01:48:03,270
like it.
Um,

2376
01:48:03,960 --> 01:48:05,400
I don't,
you know,

2377
01:48:05,480 --> 01:48:10,260
every day I feel like unless I'm beat 
down or tired or whatever,

2378
01:48:10,261 --> 01:48:15,000
I don't feel like I,
I achieved what I needed to achieve that

2379
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:16,770
day and it's just,
you know,

2380
01:48:17,140 --> 01:48:19,260
I,
I can't expect anybody else to feel like

2381
01:48:19,261 --> 01:48:20,160
that.
That's just me.

2382
01:48:20,250 --> 01:48:23,310
Everybody else is motivated,
motivated by different things,

2383
01:48:23,580 --> 01:48:27,340
have different priorities.
I'm just for me and uh,

2384
01:48:27,750 --> 01:48:29,010
it's,
you know,

2385
01:48:29,130 --> 01:48:29,963
and,
and so finding somebody who have the 

2386
01:48:31,381 --> 01:48:35,400
same mindset as me can be tough.
It's very rare.

2387
01:48:35,790 --> 01:48:36,623
It's,
it's hard for people to gravitate 

2388
01:48:38,521 --> 01:48:39,354
towards challenge,
but through challenge you get the 

2389
01:48:42,241 --> 01:48:44,730
greatest reward because through staying 
in bed,

2390
01:48:44,760 --> 01:48:47,880
like there's,
there's the call of the bed is strong,

2391
01:48:47,910 --> 01:48:49,530
the warm bed and just,
Oh,

2392
01:48:49,531 --> 01:48:53,190
let me just hit fucking snooze and this 
alarm clock and get nine more minutes.

2393
01:48:53,190 --> 01:48:55,650
Or let me just shut it off and call in 
sick to work.

2394
01:48:55,651 --> 01:48:57,420
Let me just not do what I'm supposed to 
do.

2395
01:48:57,510 --> 01:48:58,343
Let me just sleep.
And there was an article that I posted 

2396
01:49:01,321 --> 01:49:04,180
recently where they were talking about,
um,

2397
01:49:04,320 --> 01:49:07,680
the power that dopamine has dope,
mean meaning memories.

2398
01:49:07,830 --> 01:49:10,830
And it's one of the reasons why people 
have such a hard time kicking bad habits

2399
01:49:10,980 --> 01:49:11,813
is because we gravitate towards these 
like reward experiences that we have in 

2400
01:49:17,281 --> 01:49:19,800
our head.
The reward of eating shitty food or have

2401
01:49:19,801 --> 01:49:22,040
a drinking too much,
or it's your,

2402
01:49:22,530 --> 01:49:27,530
your mind sort of carves these paths 
towards these real rewarding,

2403
01:49:29,490 --> 01:49:33,330
like a almost self destructive behaviors
because those,

2404
01:49:33,390 --> 01:49:34,223
they give you a dopamine,
whether it's eating shitty food or 

2405
01:49:35,821 --> 01:49:36,654
whatever,
but it's the rare person who's mind 

2406
01:49:39,511 --> 01:49:43,530
gravitates towards the reward of 
accomplishment through reward of pushing

2407
01:49:43,531 --> 01:49:46,320
yourself through a very,
very difficult circumstance.

2408
01:49:46,320 --> 01:49:51,320
Very difficult to get to that feeling of
accomplishment like you get.

2409
01:49:51,851 --> 01:49:52,684
I'm sure when you run a marathon or like
you get when you get to the top of the 

2410
01:49:55,031 --> 01:49:56,170
mountain,
when you pushing,

2411
01:49:56,290 --> 01:49:57,123
when you don't want to and you get to it
and you did it and you know that you 

2412
01:49:59,951 --> 01:50:03,760
overcome this weakness inside of you 
that wants you to quit,

2413
01:50:03,820 --> 01:50:06,160
right?
That everybody experiences at some point

2414
01:50:06,161 --> 01:50:11,020
in their life and it's a matter of how 
you react to that experience and how you

2415
01:50:11,021 --> 01:50:12,970
react to that.
That poll,

2416
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:17,100
the poll towards the bed is strong,
pull towards weaknesses,

2417
01:50:17,140 --> 01:50:19,690
strong because it's so easy to do.
It's so easy to quit.

2418
01:50:19,720 --> 01:50:21,100
It's easy to quit.
It is.

2419
01:50:21,140 --> 01:50:23,470
See it all the time.
That's one reason why,

2420
01:50:23,471 --> 01:50:25,600
I mean it seems minor,
but you know,

2421
01:50:25,650 --> 01:50:27,530
when I get up at four or five in the 
morning,

2422
01:50:27,560 --> 01:50:28,393
I have to be at work at seven,
but when I get up early to do my fasted 

2423
01:50:30,911 --> 01:50:32,900
cardio runs,
um,

2424
01:50:33,010 --> 01:50:35,980
and I'm out and so I have no fuel.

2425
01:50:36,280 --> 01:50:37,113
I'm out there.
There's nobody out four or five in the 

2426
01:50:38,981 --> 01:50:41,530
morning and I'm running into the 
neighborhoods by my house.

2427
01:50:41,800 --> 01:50:42,633
All the lights are off.
I just envision people in their 

2428
01:50:44,681 --> 01:50:48,760
comfortable sleeping and I feel like,
you know,

2429
01:50:48,850 --> 01:50:49,690
it's,
it's,

2430
01:50:50,020 --> 01:50:51,940
I feel,
I feel the best.

2431
01:50:51,941 --> 01:50:53,650
Then when I,
you know,

2432
01:50:53,920 --> 01:50:55,570
it's like when I run the mountain,
when it's sunny,

2433
01:50:55,660 --> 01:50:59,710
I don't feel as good as when I run it,
when it's pouring rain because it's easy

2434
01:50:59,711 --> 01:51:01,540
to go out and do it when it's sunny,
if I run,

2435
01:51:01,810 --> 01:51:02,643
you know,
it on a weekend in the middle of the 

2436
01:51:04,031 --> 01:51:06,250
day.
Lots of people out there,

2437
01:51:06,310 --> 01:51:07,143
I don't feel that accomplished when I do
it at four or five in the morning when 

2438
01:51:09,671 --> 01:51:13,750
nobody's out there and it's just like 
that in my head and I,

2439
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:16,370
my head might not be normal,
but I,

2440
01:51:16,570 --> 01:51:18,670
I just love,
you know,

2441
01:51:18,760 --> 01:51:20,700
and people always say,
well,

2442
01:51:20,701 --> 01:51:22,590
you know,
all that running your,

2443
01:51:22,800 --> 01:51:25,000
you're going to be in a wheelchair by 
the time you're 60.

2444
01:51:25,060 --> 01:51:27,880
And I'm like,
who's guaranteed to live to 60?

2445
01:51:28,160 --> 01:51:29,440
I mean,
I might die tomorrow,

2446
01:51:29,720 --> 01:51:30,930
you know,
so what am I supposed to do?

2447
01:51:30,950 --> 01:51:33,330
Save myself for what I,
I,

2448
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:34,833
I want to know that I gave all I have 
every day because tomorrow's not 

2449
01:51:39,791 --> 01:51:41,380
guaranteed.
So I mean,

2450
01:51:41,650 --> 01:51:44,430
I just don't get it.
I have a hard time with that.

2451
01:51:44,720 --> 01:51:49,330
That mindset of the,
the moderation mindset,

2452
01:51:49,360 --> 01:51:50,193
those people that are saying that 
they're peering through the curtains 

2453
01:51:51,971 --> 01:51:55,690
while you're running by their house,
their sleeves gonna,

2454
01:51:55,840 --> 01:51:58,600
he's gonna wind up in a wheelchair and 
not me,

2455
01:51:58,990 --> 01:52:01,600
I'm here Martin.
I don't know.

2456
01:52:01,601 --> 01:52:02,650
I mean,
it's,

2457
01:52:02,651 --> 01:52:03,820
uh,
you know,

2458
01:52:03,890 --> 01:52:04,723
so some people,
some people criticize and maybe maybe I 

2459
01:52:07,631 --> 01:52:08,464
will be on a wheelchair,
but I'll know that I lived as hard as I 

2460
01:52:12,551 --> 01:52:13,384
could live and,
and pushed as hard as I could when I 

2461
01:52:14,771 --> 01:52:16,900
could do it and I'm not going to regret 
it.

2462
01:52:17,380 --> 01:52:18,213
Yeah.
The people that try to knock someone 

2463
01:52:20,561 --> 01:52:24,700
down for working hard and overcoming 
extreme obstacles,

2464
01:52:25,090 --> 01:52:28,720
what they're doing is they're responding
to their own insecurity.

2465
01:52:28,810 --> 01:52:30,130
I mean,
there's logical things.

2466
01:52:30,370 --> 01:52:31,360
There's people that's,
you know,

2467
01:52:31,361 --> 01:52:32,194
there's,
there's people that look at certain 

2468
01:52:33,311 --> 01:52:35,500
types of extreme sports where,
you know,

2469
01:52:35,510 --> 01:52:37,390
there's a bmx guy,
what's his name,

2470
01:52:37,391 --> 01:52:39,280
Dave Mirra,
who just committed suicide,

2471
01:52:40,120 --> 01:52:41,860
horrible,
horrible tragedy,

2472
01:52:41,950 --> 01:52:42,930
you know,
husband,

2473
01:52:42,970 --> 01:52:44,410
father,
the whole deal.

2474
01:52:44,860 --> 01:52:46,050
Um,
I gotta

2475
01:52:46,070 --> 01:52:48,980
think it's connected to head trauma.
And um,

2476
01:52:49,220 --> 01:52:50,053
I think you're talking about a 
completely different thing when you're 

2477
01:52:51,201 --> 01:52:53,030
talking about head trauma because you 
know,

2478
01:52:53,050 --> 01:52:55,430
these poor guys that do these extreme 
sports,

2479
01:52:55,470 --> 01:52:56,303
they wind up getting really banged up 
and that causes some pretty severe 

2480
01:53:00,411 --> 01:53:04,070
depression.
So I think in circumstances like that,

2481
01:53:04,280 --> 01:53:06,740
I think you're talking about a kind of a
different animal,

2482
01:53:06,741 --> 01:53:09,860
but people will criticize people who 
take chances in life.

2483
01:53:10,190 --> 01:53:12,500
People will criticize people who work 
hard,

2484
01:53:12,680 --> 01:53:14,240
you know,
like why do you have to lift weights?

2485
01:53:14,241 --> 01:53:17,480
Why do you think there was an article 
that we had talked about at some asshole

2486
01:53:17,481 --> 01:53:20,630
at written in some bowhunting magazine 
about you.

2487
01:53:20,950 --> 01:53:22,200
It online.
Yeah.

2488
01:53:22,240 --> 01:53:23,260
Well,
whatever it was,

2489
01:53:23,340 --> 01:53:25,340
you know,
he was just talking shit about you.

2490
01:53:25,370 --> 01:53:27,410
Like why does he have to,
you know,

2491
01:53:27,420 --> 01:53:29,120
you don't have to lift weights like this
guy,

2492
01:53:29,121 --> 01:53:29,690
you don't have to.

2493
01:53:29,690 --> 01:53:31,850
This is ridiculous.
But guess what?

2494
01:53:31,990 --> 01:53:32,823
Yeah,
you do.

2495
01:53:33,140 --> 01:53:35,210
If you want to do what you can do,
you have to.

2496
01:53:35,240 --> 01:53:36,030
Yeah.
It mean.

2497
01:53:36,030 --> 01:53:40,190
And what he's doing by writing that is 
looking at someone who works harder than

2498
01:53:40,191 --> 01:53:41,024
him,
accomplishes more than him and he's 

2499
01:53:41,871 --> 01:53:44,330
trying to chop you down.
And that's crabs in a bucket,

2500
01:53:44,331 --> 01:53:45,141
man.
That's people.

2501
01:53:45,141 --> 01:53:45,974
Do you ever see crabs in a bucket?
If you don't know what I'm talking 

2502
01:53:47,781 --> 01:53:48,450
about,
folks,

2503
01:53:48,450 --> 01:53:49,283
if you see crabs in a bucket,
they never get out of that fucking 

2504
01:53:50,451 --> 01:53:52,490
bucket.
Because if they work together,

2505
01:53:52,610 --> 01:53:53,443
one crap could stand on another crab and
the other crab grab on the top and then 

2506
01:53:55,791 --> 01:53:58,160
they could figure out a way to push that
bucket over and they get all get out,

2507
01:53:58,161 --> 01:54:00,800
but nope.
What happens is one crab tries to get to

2508
01:54:00,801 --> 01:54:01,634
the top and the other crabs pull him 
down and that's what a lot of people 

2509
01:54:04,251 --> 01:54:04,430
are.

2510
01:54:04,430 --> 01:54:05,263
A lot of people are crabs in a bucket 
and it's just a weakness and an 

2511
01:54:08,001 --> 01:54:08,834
insecurity and a lot of times it's 
because they don't know anybody like 

2512
01:54:12,051 --> 01:54:13,850
you.
They don't know anybody like Roy.

2513
01:54:14,150 --> 01:54:16,070
They don't know anybody that can push 
them.

2514
01:54:16,100 --> 01:54:16,933
They don't know anybody that they can.
They can look at their friend and they 

2515
01:54:19,701 --> 01:54:21,050
could say,
you know,

2516
01:54:21,080 --> 01:54:23,220
this motherfucker can do it.
I can do it too.

2517
01:54:23,300 --> 01:54:25,580
If this guy,
if I know what he would do right now.

2518
01:54:25,700 --> 01:54:27,560
He's like,
here's a funny story.

2519
01:54:27,890 --> 01:54:28,723
I was in Texas with Aubrey and we were 
pig hunting and we were in this fucking 

2520
01:54:36,080 --> 01:54:38,090
moves,
reliable environment.

2521
01:54:38,360 --> 01:54:41,030
There was so many mosquitoes.
It was brutal.

2522
01:54:41,031 --> 01:54:42,620
I mean,
we were just getting mauled.

2523
01:54:42,830 --> 01:54:44,090
By the end of the day.
I mean,

2524
01:54:44,091 --> 01:54:45,740
it looked like I had some kind of crazy 
disease,

2525
01:54:45,741 --> 01:54:46,574
like my whole body was covered in 
mosquito bites and I thought to myself 

2526
01:54:50,181 --> 01:54:52,760
while I was out there,
if campaigns was out here,

2527
01:54:52,910 --> 01:54:54,110
he would fucking keep going.

2528
01:54:54,140 --> 01:54:54,973
He would just deal with the fact that 
mosquitoes are biting him and he would 

2529
01:54:56,451 --> 01:54:57,284
keep going and rob said,
how the fuck did you get through all 

2530
01:55:00,531 --> 01:55:02,180
those mosquitoes?
And I said,

2531
01:55:02,300 --> 01:55:04,820
I thought if campaigns was out here,
he would keep going.

2532
01:55:04,821 --> 01:55:05,900
He goes,
that's hilarious.

2533
01:55:05,901 --> 01:55:08,330
Because I thought if Joe Rogan can do 
it,

2534
01:55:08,331 --> 01:55:13,331
I can do it without even be there pushed
me and me because I kept going.

2535
01:55:15,920 --> 01:55:17,060
It pushed him,
but we were,

2536
01:55:17,210 --> 01:55:18,310
it was fucking miserable.
We were,

2537
01:55:18,320 --> 01:55:21,650
there's this cloud of mosquitoes we just
swarmed on.

2538
01:55:22,010 --> 01:55:22,431
Well,
you know,

2539
01:55:22,431 --> 01:55:23,610
I mean it's,
you know,

2540
01:55:23,650 --> 01:55:24,483
it is a funny story but I do in some way
feel responsibility to the people that 

2541
01:55:30,651 --> 01:55:34,790
follow me or look up to me to not give 
up.

2542
01:55:35,240 --> 01:55:39,070
I know people look to me for inspiration
and you know,

2543
01:55:39,300 --> 01:55:40,160
and,
and it helps.

2544
01:55:40,161 --> 01:55:42,410
It's like when I don't feel like doing 
something,

2545
01:55:42,560 --> 01:55:44,100
I think about all the people who

2546
01:55:44,340 --> 01:55:45,173
expect me to.
I mean I have a huge drive to do it 

2547
01:55:47,191 --> 01:55:48,024
myself,
but it's just like sometimes those 

2548
01:55:49,981 --> 01:55:51,810
little things and thinking about,
you know,

2549
01:55:51,860 --> 01:55:56,850
this story with you or people who have 
lost a hundred pounds thinking about,

2550
01:55:56,910 --> 01:55:59,250
you know,
the work I put in,

2551
01:55:59,251 --> 01:56:02,190
it's like all those things have made me 
who I am.

2552
01:56:02,191 --> 01:56:03,730
So it's a,
it's not like I,

2553
01:56:03,731 --> 01:56:04,564
I think about specific stories,
but I think about all the people who 

2554
01:56:06,780 --> 01:56:07,613
have been such a positive message,
a positive impact on me because I guess 

2555
01:56:14,401 --> 01:56:15,900
I haven't on them,
you know,

2556
01:56:15,901 --> 01:56:18,750
so can return it and it makes me,
you know,

2557
01:56:18,960 --> 01:56:21,600
it like the,
like the big foot $200 that I'm doing.

2558
01:56:22,170 --> 01:56:25,830
If I'm just on my own and nobody knows 
who I am,

2559
01:56:26,400 --> 01:56:28,620
I'm much less,
much less,

2560
01:56:28,680 --> 01:56:33,680
a much are not as tough a muscle,
a less resilient as the guy I'm going to

2561
01:56:35,101 --> 01:56:35,934
be who will line up to run the big foot 
200 and August because I'll feel like 

2562
01:56:39,001 --> 01:56:44,001
I'll have an army of people helping me 
push me and I just think that that's,

2563
01:56:44,490 --> 01:56:45,323
you know,
as a society that's a type of things we 

2564
01:56:48,540 --> 01:56:49,440
need to focus on.

2565
01:56:49,530 --> 01:56:52,230
I believe.
So inspiration to two way street.

2566
01:56:52,290 --> 01:56:53,940
Yeah.
When you inspire people,

2567
01:56:53,941 --> 01:56:58,170
those like I do these meet and greets 
after shows you all the time and I can't

2568
01:56:58,171 --> 01:57:02,010
tell you how many people have come up to
after show that say I lost 100 pounds.

2569
01:57:02,011 --> 01:57:03,450
Once I started listening to your 
podcast,

2570
01:57:03,451 --> 01:57:04,284
I started eating healthy.
I started looking at my body in a 

2571
01:57:05,581 --> 01:57:09,270
different way and I started realizing 
like I will be happier if I took care of

2572
01:57:09,271 --> 01:57:13,440
myself and then I'm happier when I do 
force myself to exercise and now I do it

2573
01:57:13,441 --> 01:57:14,274
everyday and I'm drinking Kale shakes 
and I'm eating healthy foods and I 

2574
01:57:16,321 --> 01:57:19,620
stopped drinking and all this and it 
makes me feel better.

2575
01:57:19,670 --> 01:57:21,840
I mean,
I think about it when I work out,

2576
01:57:21,850 --> 01:57:22,683
I quickly.
That's where inspiration is a two way 

2577
01:57:25,111 --> 01:57:27,450
street and then it's also what we were 
talking about,

2578
01:57:27,451 --> 01:57:29,790
like you've created a community through 
your,

2579
01:57:29,850 --> 01:57:34,110
your social media and through the the 
positive posts that you make and through

2580
01:57:34,570 --> 01:57:36,840
through all your actions and all the 
different things you've done,

2581
01:57:36,841 --> 01:57:40,020
you've created this sort of sense of 
community where all these other people,

2582
01:57:40,290 --> 01:57:41,123
they feed off of that and you feed off 
of them and we all feed off of each 

2583
01:57:43,861 --> 01:57:44,160
other.

2584
01:57:44,160 --> 01:57:44,993
Yeah,
no,

2585
01:57:45,050 --> 01:57:46,440
it's through this podcast to,
man,

2586
01:57:46,441 --> 01:57:48,870
this has been a nuisance,
an inspirational podcasts.

2587
01:57:48,871 --> 01:57:50,910
I'm going to listen to this podcast when
I workout tomorrow.

2588
01:57:50,940 --> 01:57:51,631
Yeah.
When I.

2589
01:57:51,631 --> 01:57:52,464
When I do my morning workout tomorrow,
I'm going to put this on my headphones 

2590
01:57:54,781 --> 01:57:55,614
and I'm willing to listen to this.
I'm going to listen to specifically to 

2591
01:57:57,411 --> 01:57:59,260
the story about you and Roy.
Yeah,

2592
01:57:59,580 --> 01:58:01,590
and that,
you know,

2593
01:58:01,920 --> 01:58:03,990
people want to be that kind of person.
You know,

2594
01:58:04,080 --> 01:58:07,380
people don't want to be a lazy fuck who 
criticizes people for no reason.

2595
01:58:07,381 --> 01:58:08,214
They don't.
They don't want to be that guy that's 

2596
01:58:08,851 --> 01:58:12,510
weak and that talk shit about someone 
when they're not there because they feel

2597
01:58:12,511 --> 01:58:14,490
bad that that person is out there 
working out.

2598
01:58:14,491 --> 01:58:15,324
Well,
you don't want to have to do with Kim 

2599
01:58:16,080 --> 01:58:16,913
Haines.
Dude,

2600
01:58:16,960 --> 01:58:18,570
shut the fuck up.
You know what you're doing,

2601
01:58:18,571 --> 01:58:19,680
bitch.
You know what you're doing.

2602
01:58:19,681 --> 01:58:21,330
When you're doing that,
while you're doing it,

2603
01:58:21,331 --> 01:58:22,590
you know what you're doing.
While you're making those,

2604
01:58:22,710 --> 01:58:23,543
you know there's a little sneaky voice 
in the back of your head unless you're 

2605
01:58:25,351 --> 01:58:26,184
completely obtuse,
unless you're completely oblivious to 

2606
01:58:28,440 --> 01:58:30,600
the way you interact and interface with 
the world,

2607
01:58:30,750 --> 01:58:32,430
you know what you do and when you say 
those things,

2608
01:58:32,640 --> 01:58:33,473
he tried to chop someone down because 
they make you feel weak and instead of 

2609
01:58:35,971 --> 01:58:36,804
saying,
this guy is out there doing something 

2610
01:58:38,671 --> 01:58:42,280
awesome instead of just what's what's 
negative about someone working

2611
01:58:42,280 --> 01:58:45,820
out and being healthy.
What's negative about someone who values

2612
01:58:45,880 --> 01:58:48,970
physical fitness and accomplishing 
difficult goals?

2613
01:58:49,390 --> 01:58:50,223
That is the essence of character.
That's the essence of what's 

2614
01:58:52,841 --> 01:58:53,674
inspirational about a person.
I'm not inspired by someone who sleeps 

2615
01:58:56,531 --> 01:58:57,364
till two.
I'm not inspired by someone who can not 

2616
01:58:59,231 --> 01:59:01,540
eat shitty food and loves to smoke.

2617
01:59:01,850 --> 01:59:03,720
Inspired by discipline,
discipline.

2618
01:59:03,750 --> 01:59:06,720
I love discipline and as you talked 
about,

2619
01:59:06,721 --> 01:59:11,721
the rock guys like the Rock and the rock
is out to $40 million.

2620
01:59:12,001 --> 01:59:15,390
You get out to how many will listen to 
this podcast?

2621
01:59:15,440 --> 01:59:15,840
I mean,

2622
01:59:15,840 --> 01:59:16,673
I don't know,
but it'd be more than a million for 

2623
01:59:17,971 --> 01:59:18,730
sure.
Millions.

2624
01:59:18,730 --> 01:59:21,690
So over the course of how many years 
this is out there in the world,

2625
01:59:21,720 --> 01:59:22,160
right?

2626
01:59:22,160 --> 01:59:22,993
So I'm inspired by you,
the Rock and so in my own little 

2627
01:59:26,181 --> 01:59:29,360
bowhunting world,
I just try to live up to that and,

2628
01:59:29,690 --> 01:59:32,690
and you know,
I guess what I wanted,

2629
01:59:32,780 --> 01:59:35,270
I want to thank you for giving me this 
platform,

2630
01:59:35,550 --> 01:59:39,230
given me access to all you've created 
here because,

2631
01:59:39,470 --> 01:59:41,360
you know,
as we've talked about,

2632
01:59:41,390 --> 01:59:44,690
that's what feels good to reach people,
inspire people,

2633
01:59:44,840 --> 01:59:45,673
and yet maybe they'll be inspired maybe 
even a little by the heartbreak of 

2634
01:59:48,621 --> 01:59:50,180
losing a good buddy,
you know,

2635
01:59:50,330 --> 01:59:54,620
maybe to be a better friend or maybe to 
be somebody who,

2636
01:59:54,980 --> 01:59:55,970
uh,
I don't know,

2637
01:59:55,971 --> 01:59:57,710
that integral part of somebody else's 
life.

2638
01:59:57,711 --> 01:59:59,810
Maybe that'll inspire them.
Maybe the workout part,

2639
01:59:59,990 --> 02:00:02,240
who knows,
maybe it'll be a better,

2640
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:03,590
uh,
I don't know,

2641
02:00:03,591 --> 02:00:06,800
more understanding to the vegans and be 
able to explain it better.

2642
02:00:06,920 --> 02:00:07,753
There's so much you can take from this 
podcast and without you giving me this 

2643
02:00:10,971 --> 02:00:12,350
microphone,
it would never happen.

2644
02:00:12,351 --> 02:00:14,030
So I want to thank you and,
uh,

2645
02:00:14,090 --> 02:00:15,570
I'm so grateful.
Uh,

2646
02:00:16,400 --> 02:00:17,233
I've just,
I'm so happy I've met you and now we've 

2647
02:00:18,891 --> 02:00:19,760
created this friendship.

2648
02:00:19,870 --> 02:00:22,560
I couldn't be more happy myself.
And again,

2649
02:00:22,590 --> 02:00:23,423
that inspiration is a two way street.
This podcast doesn't exist if it's not 

2650
02:00:26,101 --> 02:00:30,030
for other people,
mean what all I am is like an antenna or

2651
02:00:30,031 --> 02:00:30,864
something.
Just broadcasting my thoughts and other 

2652
02:00:32,911 --> 02:00:33,744
people's thoughts too.
And without a guy like you to introduce 

2653
02:00:35,401 --> 02:00:37,560
me to something like bowhunting,
I would have no idea.

2654
02:00:37,800 --> 02:00:38,633
I would've gone to my grave without 
having any idea how rewarding it is to 

2655
02:00:41,161 --> 02:00:45,090
go and get my own meat through archery 
in the woods.

2656
02:00:45,120 --> 02:00:48,600
How difficult it is to pursue such an 
incredibly,

2657
02:00:49,920 --> 02:00:50,753
incredibly demanding discipline.
And what that's about and for you being 

2658
02:00:54,961 --> 02:00:57,540
inspirational and for you creating those
videos,

2659
02:00:57,810 --> 02:01:02,490
you reached me and in you touched me 
with your positivity and with your,

2660
02:01:02,491 --> 02:01:05,340
your inspiration and with your 
dedication and focus.

2661
02:01:05,640 --> 02:01:08,700
And I live for that man.
I live for inspiration.

2662
02:01:08,701 --> 02:01:10,230
That's my fuel.
I love it.

2663
02:01:10,500 --> 02:01:11,333
I love inspiring people.
I love people that are inspiring me and 

2664
02:01:14,791 --> 02:01:17,520
I love inspiring other people.
I love inspiration.

2665
02:01:17,790 --> 02:01:18,623
I think it's one of the most,
one of the most powerful aspects about 

2666
02:01:21,241 --> 02:01:23,730
our new found ability to communicate 
with each other,

2667
02:01:23,850 --> 02:01:24,260
right?

2668
02:01:24,260 --> 02:01:25,400
Social media,
so you can.

2669
02:01:25,460 --> 02:01:28,040
You can be a negative anchor or you can 
inspire,

2670
02:01:28,041 --> 02:01:28,874
so yeah,
maybe that's the message of the podcast 

2671
02:01:31,311 --> 02:01:32,450
today.
Just get out there,

2672
02:01:32,600 --> 02:01:33,433
like I say,
make a positive difference and it 

2673
02:01:35,800 --> 02:01:36,710
doesn't have.
We can all do.

2674
02:01:36,711 --> 02:01:38,960
It doesn't have to be big.
It doesn't have to be to 40 million,

2675
02:01:39,050 --> 02:01:40,220
10 million or a 1 million

2676
02:01:40,390 --> 02:01:42,460
Haggen Beto one guy.
Yes.

2677
02:01:42,500 --> 02:01:45,800
Make a positive difference.
We can all do it and we can all do it in

2678
02:01:45,801 --> 02:01:49,550
our own way and it's the better way to 
live.

2679
02:01:49,640 --> 02:01:50,473
It's the better way to live this.
This world that we're living in right 

2680
02:01:53,961 --> 02:01:57,860
now is essentially a global community 
that is coming to awaken.

2681
02:01:57,890 --> 02:02:01,610
It's aware of itself now in a way that's
never been a before.

2682
02:02:01,850 --> 02:02:04,040
We can communicate with each other like 
you know,

2683
02:02:04,410 --> 02:02:07,700
there's this strange new time where you 
can.

2684
02:02:07,940 --> 02:02:10,100
You could seek out shit that pisses you 
off.

2685
02:02:10,400 --> 02:02:14,150
You can see you could just fucking spend
all day on Kanye West instagram page and

2686
02:02:14,151 --> 02:02:14,984
get angry.

2687
02:02:16,700 --> 02:02:17,533
You can just scour through all of the 
worst aspects of all sorts of different 

2688
02:02:21,351 --> 02:02:24,590
people,
or you can choose to be inspired.

2689
02:02:24,620 --> 02:02:29,620
You can choose to live your life in a 
powerful and dedicated way,

2690
02:02:30,180 --> 02:02:32,600
but there's only one way to do that is 
through action.

2691
02:02:33,620 --> 02:02:34,700
It's a choice.
Yeah,

2692
02:02:34,701 --> 02:02:36,950
it is a choice man,
but it's a good choice.

2693
02:02:36,951 --> 02:02:41,951
It's a great choice to make.
It's way through that choice.

2694
02:02:42,441 --> 02:02:43,274
You enrich yourself and enrich the other
people that you've come in contact with 

2695
02:02:45,620 --> 02:02:48,620
and then we're strong or a stronger as,
as as society.

2696
02:02:48,840 --> 02:02:49,673
You know we're not perfect.
People folks know we're all we all fuck 

2697
02:02:52,551 --> 02:02:53,384
up.
We all get mad when we shouldn't get 

2698
02:02:54,651 --> 02:02:55,484
mad.
We all falter and through those lessons 

2699
02:02:58,400 --> 02:03:02,090
of failure,
sometimes the disappointment you have in

2700
02:03:02,091 --> 02:03:02,924
yourself when you come up short is the 
fuel you need to make sure you never 

2701
02:03:06,141 --> 02:03:06,974
come up short that way again and maybe 
you'll come up short and another way 

2702
02:03:09,141 --> 02:03:09,620
next week.

2703
02:03:09,620 --> 02:03:10,040
You know?
Well,

2704
02:03:10,040 --> 02:03:11,900
that fucking thing is never going to 
happen again either.

2705
02:03:12,220 --> 02:03:14,380
And you find a way to assess.
Yeah,

2706
02:03:14,420 --> 02:03:15,253
it is a process and that's one of the 
things that I really try to drill into 

2707
02:03:18,651 --> 02:03:19,461
people's heads.
You know,

2708
02:03:19,461 --> 02:03:20,031
they go,
Oh,

2709
02:03:20,031 --> 02:03:21,740
can you?
How have you done so many things?

2710
02:03:22,010 --> 02:03:24,530
I've done so many things because I've 
sucked at all of them.

2711
02:03:24,980 --> 02:03:28,130
Everything I've ever tried,
I sucked at in the beginning,

2712
02:03:28,160 --> 02:03:32,690
everything you fail and then you learn 
how to not fail and you,

2713
02:03:32,691 --> 02:03:33,710
you know,
how do you,

2714
02:03:33,740 --> 02:03:35,720
how do you do that?
Will you take God damn chances?

2715
02:03:35,930 --> 02:03:36,763
That's how.
That's how you start a bow hunting at 

2716
02:03:37,821 --> 02:03:39,740
45.
You got to fucking take chances.

2717
02:03:39,950 --> 02:03:42,470
And if you don't take chances,
if you stay within your comfort zone,

2718
02:03:42,860 --> 02:03:44,720
man,
that's not a fun life.

2719
02:03:44,780 --> 02:03:45,613
Now,
it's not a,

2720
02:03:45,650 --> 02:03:47,330
it's a,
it's,

2721
02:03:47,380 --> 02:03:49,160
it's a cushy life.

2722
02:03:49,340 --> 02:03:52,040
It's probably a little safer.
It's insulated.

2723
02:03:52,041 --> 02:03:54,610
And that's what I've always respected 
about you is you,

2724
02:03:54,670 --> 02:03:57,200
when you started bowhunting and,
and you know,

2725
02:03:57,290 --> 02:03:59,870
it's because I know firsthand how 
difficult it is.

2726
02:03:59,930 --> 02:04:03,080
So you've been successful in so many 
different arenas,

2727
02:04:03,110 --> 02:04:04,430
right?
And been,

2728
02:04:05,050 --> 02:04:05,883
you're Joe Rogan,
all of a sudden Joe Rogan is a new bow 

2729
02:04:09,191 --> 02:04:11,930
hunter who doesn't know shit about 
anything and it's like,

2730
02:04:11,931 --> 02:04:16,160
for you to say I'm okay with that.
That's a big deal.

2731
02:04:16,190 --> 02:04:17,023
Most people who have been so successful 
don't want to be starting out on ground 

2732
02:04:20,451 --> 02:04:21,870
zero again.
So I mean,

2733
02:04:22,010 --> 02:04:24,520
for you to do that and then and then 
becomes.

2734
02:04:24,521 --> 02:04:25,354
So just disciplined and enamored with 
the discipline of bowhunting has been 

2735
02:04:31,431 --> 02:04:32,570
awesome.
And uh,

2736
02:04:32,900 --> 02:04:35,390
I love it.
I love doing things I suck at.

2737
02:04:36,230 --> 02:04:37,063
Most people don't.
That's why I like yoga and I mean it's 

2738
02:04:39,931 --> 02:04:40,550
why,
uh,

2739
02:04:40,550 --> 02:04:41,383
like when we were working out today,
you have that same sort of approach to 

2740
02:04:44,071 --> 02:04:44,904
like we were showing you all these crazy
new exercises and you were gravitating 

2741
02:04:48,181 --> 02:04:49,700
towards the ones that you weren't good 
at.

2742
02:04:50,650 --> 02:04:51,483
I mean,
it was.

2743
02:04:51,720 --> 02:04:52,331
Yeah,
I mean,

2744
02:04:52,331 --> 02:04:54,060
I,
I love pushing myself.

2745
02:04:54,061 --> 02:04:56,640
It's like when I,
when I work out with New People,

2746
02:04:56,790 --> 02:04:59,580
I love exposing them to.
I said,

2747
02:04:59,581 --> 02:05:00,414
okay,
this workout doesn't start until you're 

2748
02:05:02,611 --> 02:05:05,040
miserable.
And then once you're miserable,

2749
02:05:05,100 --> 02:05:08,700
then it counts because everybody can do 
it when it's easy.

2750
02:05:08,760 --> 02:05:09,990
Right?
Okay.

2751
02:05:09,991 --> 02:05:13,370
Now you can't do it.
Now we start and it's just like I,

2752
02:05:13,371 --> 02:05:14,820
you know,
I had a good eye.

2753
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:17,520
I just like exposing.
People would always say,

2754
02:05:17,521 --> 02:05:18,354
you know,
and people,

2755
02:05:18,400 --> 02:05:20,250
other people have said it too.
I didn't invent this,

2756
02:05:20,251 --> 02:05:21,084
but being comfortable from being 
uncomfortable and that's this getting 

2757
02:05:24,211 --> 02:05:25,350
that moment where,
okay,

2758
02:05:25,560 --> 02:05:28,620
now I'm here,
now I want to start gaining,

2759
02:05:28,680 --> 02:05:30,030
you know?
And that's,

2760
02:05:30,600 --> 02:05:32,520
that's just the,
that's the journey that anything,

2761
02:05:32,521 --> 02:05:34,920
this has a big reward is going to 
require that.

2762
02:05:35,040 --> 02:05:36,570
Well,
that's the essence of Jujitsu.

2763
02:05:37,590 --> 02:05:38,423
Jujitsu is being comfortable while 
you're uncomfortable because everybody 

2764
02:05:42,331 --> 02:05:43,100
gets tapped.

2765
02:05:43,100 --> 02:05:43,933
There is no way to get good at Jujitsu 
unless you get mauled by another person 

2766
02:05:46,711 --> 02:05:48,960
is the only way.
And you know,

2767
02:05:48,961 --> 02:05:52,230
for me,
I started Jujitsu as you know,

2768
02:05:52,290 --> 02:05:53,123
a,
a former taekwondo champion who would 

2769
02:05:54,631 --> 02:05:56,800
spend my whole lot.
I was successful.

2770
02:05:56,801 --> 02:05:59,370
It's striking my whole life.
I had done,

2771
02:05:59,400 --> 02:06:03,270
you know,
different forms of striking competitions

2772
02:06:03,510 --> 02:06:04,343
and then all of a sudden I'm doing 
Jujitsu and getting fucking crushed by 

2773
02:06:06,881 --> 02:06:10,740
people were my size or smaller and 
they're just beating the piss out of me.

2774
02:06:10,950 --> 02:06:12,330
Like I'm a ragdoll.
I'm a,

2775
02:06:12,331 --> 02:06:15,930
I'm a grappling dummy and for me I had 
realized I had,

2776
02:06:15,931 --> 02:06:16,764
first of all,
I had to address the fact that I was 

2777
02:06:18,301 --> 02:06:21,480
nowhere near as competent in self 
defense is.

2778
02:06:21,481 --> 02:06:23,820
I thought I was like,
as soon as these guys got ahold of me,

2779
02:06:23,821 --> 02:06:24,990
they were just strangling me.
I was like,

2780
02:06:25,030 --> 02:06:25,863
okay,
like my perception of what I could do 

2781
02:06:27,571 --> 02:06:30,750
versus the reality of what I could do 
was I had to,

2782
02:06:30,810 --> 02:06:34,050
I had to just address it,
I had to figure it out and so okay,

2783
02:06:34,200 --> 02:06:37,020
now I've got to get fucking crazy and 
attached to this shit.

2784
02:06:37,350 --> 02:06:42,350
And then I became completely obsessed 
with that about of training and getting.

2785
02:06:43,720 --> 02:06:45,820
But that's one of the beautiful things 
about Jujitsu.

2786
02:06:45,850 --> 02:06:46,683
One of the things about Jujitsu that I 
admire most in the truly good 

2787
02:06:50,011 --> 02:06:53,810
practitioners is they have very healthy 
egos because their,

2788
02:06:53,890 --> 02:06:55,740
their,
their egos get tested.

2789
02:06:55,741 --> 02:06:56,910
Yeah.
They're in check all the time.

2790
02:06:57,000 --> 02:07:00,240
Constantly tapping tap all the time.
Yeah.

2791
02:07:00,510 --> 02:07:02,550
I mean,
I don't think I've ever gone more than a

2792
02:07:02,550 --> 02:07:03,900
few months in my whole life without 
tapping.

2793
02:07:04,170 --> 02:07:05,670
Well,
and that's the same with bowhunting.

2794
02:07:06,360 --> 02:07:08,400
Don't start bowhunting unless you can 
deal with failure.

2795
02:07:08,680 --> 02:07:10,050
You know,
it's a humbling.

2796
02:07:10,080 --> 02:07:11,730
Just like,
just like you know,

2797
02:07:11,940 --> 02:07:15,270
the discipline you're talking about.
Bowhunting is a discipline.

2798
02:07:15,271 --> 02:07:16,104
Just like that.
It will humble you no matter how good 

2799
02:07:17,821 --> 02:07:18,654
you think you will.
I think all very difficult things are 

2800
02:07:22,141 --> 02:07:23,130
good for you.
Wait,

2801
02:07:23,160 --> 02:07:25,410
as long as it doesn't kill you,
it's good for you.

2802
02:07:25,411 --> 02:07:27,540
I mean like these goddamn ultra 
marathons,

2803
02:07:27,541 --> 02:07:32,430
you're running this crazy fuck you want 
100 miles is not enough.

2804
02:07:32,520 --> 02:07:33,091
You're like,
well,

2805
02:07:33,091 --> 02:07:34,500
I've already done that a couple of 
times.

2806
02:07:34,501 --> 02:07:36,010
Now I got to do 200.
So

2807
02:07:36,010 --> 02:07:37,420
here's the big foot,
200.

2808
02:07:37,421 --> 02:07:38,254
His quick facts.
Jamie just pulled up just under 50,000 

2809
02:07:41,081 --> 02:07:41,914
feet of a sent 15,240 meters of a cent.
More than 96,000 feet of elevation 

2810
02:07:48,611 --> 02:07:49,444
change.
Two hundred and three point eight miles 

2811
02:07:51,971 --> 02:07:54,970
nonstop.
Point to point six.

2812
02:07:54,971 --> 02:07:57,010
Sleep stations with full aid,
hot food,

2813
02:07:57,011 --> 02:08:00,190
medical and crew access.
16 full aid stations.

2814
02:08:01,360 --> 02:08:04,960
The race starts at Mount St Helens in 
the cascade mountain range of Washington

2815
02:08:04,961 --> 02:08:07,480
state and finishes in Randall 
Washington.

2816
02:08:07,481 --> 02:08:10,570
Traversing point to point the cascade 
mountains.

2817
02:08:10,660 --> 02:08:11,493
That's insane.

2818
02:08:11,750 --> 02:08:15,030
That's a.
So my goal with it and I've never done a

2819
02:08:15,031 --> 02:08:15,864
200,
obviously the furthest I've run is 106 

2820
02:08:18,031 --> 02:08:21,990
and a half miles in 24 hours.
So this will be a new test.

2821
02:08:22,050 --> 02:08:24,980
Um,
and my goal for this ad,

2822
02:08:25,620 --> 02:08:27,660
and I don't even know if it's possible.
I don't want to sleep,

2823
02:08:27,661 --> 02:08:29,380
I don't take advantage of any of those 
sleep stages.

2824
02:08:29,381 --> 02:08:33,660
I want to be able to push through and 
finish in 60 hours and last year,

2825
02:08:33,661 --> 02:08:36,150
64 hours one it.
And I'm trying to,

2826
02:08:36,270 --> 02:08:39,510
that's what I'm training you want to 
beat that I want to beat that.

2827
02:08:39,590 --> 02:08:40,423
I want,
I want to beat six 64 and I just want 

2828
02:08:42,341 --> 02:08:43,710
to,
I want to grind it out.

2829
02:08:43,711 --> 02:08:46,740
I want to be better than I've ever been.
And so that's,

2830
02:08:46,800 --> 02:08:48,060
you know,
right now I'm training.

2831
02:08:48,420 --> 02:08:52,200
I haven't been training this hard this 
early in the year so I'm taking it.

2832
02:08:52,690 --> 02:08:53,523
I'm doing a lot of miles but not 
hammering hard and a bill trying to 

2833
02:08:57,361 --> 02:08:59,970
build up that base.
So come August,

2834
02:09:00,210 --> 02:09:02,340
I hope to line up there for the big foot
200.

2835
02:09:02,341 --> 02:09:04,500
And I hope to run it faster than it's 
ever been run.

2836
02:09:04,990 --> 02:09:05,823
Jesus Christ.
Are you going to lose body mass before 

2837
02:09:08,491 --> 02:09:10,290
you do that?
Because you're always lifting weights.

2838
02:09:10,320 --> 02:09:11,730
Like what?
What are you going to do differently?

2839
02:09:13,020 --> 02:09:16,450
I need to get lighter.
A way about what [inaudible] 77.

2840
02:09:16,451 --> 02:09:17,460
Yeah.
Right now I am,

2841
02:09:17,461 --> 02:09:18,294
you know,
and I was up one 82 or 83 and so I'm 

2842
02:09:20,731 --> 02:09:22,140
trying to,
I want to get down.

2843
02:09:22,290 --> 02:09:25,320
I'd like to get 69 maybe,
you know,

2844
02:09:25,321 --> 02:09:29,220
and I think I just really feel like I'd 
be efficient at that and I just,

2845
02:09:29,250 --> 02:09:30,090
you know,
it's,

2846
02:09:30,510 --> 02:09:32,400
it's,
it's physical,

2847
02:09:32,401 --> 02:09:36,330
but it's a lot mental also.
So I mean I'll get my,

2848
02:09:36,360 --> 02:09:37,193
I'll prepare my body for it,
but it's just whether I can hydrate and 

2849
02:09:40,921 --> 02:09:42,450
fuel,
uh,

2850
02:09:42,451 --> 02:09:45,690
well enough,
smart enough and just do everything.

2851
02:09:45,700 --> 02:09:48,270
Keep my feet healthy.
That's what's going to determine whether

2852
02:09:48,271 --> 02:09:49,770
I can finish the 60 hours.
So,

2853
02:09:49,771 --> 02:09:50,760
uh,
I think I,

2854
02:09:50,940 --> 02:09:53,780
I believe I have what it takes.
Um,

2855
02:09:54,570 --> 02:09:56,940
but a lot of people probably have what 
it takes,

2856
02:09:57,330 --> 02:09:59,610
but to implement it is going to be 
difficult.

2857
02:09:59,611 --> 02:10:00,444
But,
um,

2858
02:10:00,570 --> 02:10:02,190
I can't wait.
I wish it was tomorrow.

2859
02:10:02,220 --> 02:10:05,910
What's the percentage of people who 
start that thing versus completed?

2860
02:10:06,230 --> 02:10:07,063
I don't know.
I think it's pretty high percentage 

2861
02:10:08,311 --> 02:10:12,690
because if you line up for 200,
you didn't just decide to do that.

2862
02:10:12,740 --> 02:10:13,710
Right?
You know what I mean?

2863
02:10:13,860 --> 02:10:14,693
These people are crazy.
They've put in a lot of training and so 

2864
02:10:19,550 --> 02:10:21,090
if,
if they're crazy enough,

2865
02:10:21,120 --> 02:10:22,770
I mean it's a thousand dollars to run 
it.

2866
02:10:22,860 --> 02:10:26,730
So if they're crazy enough to pay the 
entry fee lineup there,

2867
02:10:27,540 --> 02:10:30,000
they didn't just,
it wasn't on a whim.

2868
02:10:30,210 --> 02:10:31,620
It was,
they've geared their life,

2869
02:10:31,621 --> 02:10:32,940
tore it.
It's crazy too.

2870
02:10:33,140 --> 02:10:34,340
It's not a thousand mile.

2871
02:10:34,350 --> 02:10:36,560
I mean,
it's not 200 miles on a flat track.

2872
02:10:36,580 --> 02:10:38,540
Now it's mountains,
mountains.

2873
02:10:38,541 --> 02:10:39,380
I mean,
you know,

2874
02:10:39,381 --> 02:10:44,210
that 50,000 feet of ascent,
that's what does that to Mount Everest.

2875
02:10:44,930 --> 02:10:47,600
Jesus Christ is Mount Everest.
Thirty thousand feet.

2876
02:10:47,780 --> 02:10:50,240
I think it's 26.
She something like that.

2877
02:10:50,470 --> 02:10:54,980
So it's two of those,
but it has that same,

2878
02:10:55,760 --> 02:10:57,800
uh,
so it's 96,000 feet or changed.

2879
02:10:57,801 --> 02:10:58,634
So what that means is you're grinding up
as much as you're hammering down and 

2880
02:11:01,131 --> 02:11:03,500
that down.
Break your quads down.

2881
02:11:03,501 --> 02:11:06,390
As you know.
It's a hard low yourself down.

2882
02:11:07,580 --> 02:11:08,900
This is a video of it.
Yeah.

2883
02:11:09,260 --> 02:11:11,030
So that's,
that's a country that it's in.

2884
02:11:11,390 --> 02:11:12,830
What is this guy doing?
He's walking.

2885
02:11:12,860 --> 02:11:16,340
Run Bitch while you're walking.
Well there's like God,

2886
02:11:16,400 --> 02:11:17,400
this is the country.
Yeah,

2887
02:11:17,420 --> 02:11:19,250
this is it.
You can't run this.

2888
02:11:19,280 --> 02:11:20,420
Wait a minute,
hold on a second.

2889
02:11:20,470 --> 02:11:21,500
Yeah,
it's like this.

2890
02:11:21,560 --> 02:11:23,000
Yes.
Oh fuck.

2891
02:11:23,110 --> 02:11:24,890
Artist ultra in the USA,
right?

2892
02:11:24,900 --> 02:11:26,660
Do you know which way to go?
How do you go left or right?

2893
02:11:26,690 --> 02:11:27,523
There'll be ribbons.
So there's probably ribbons that'll 

2894
02:11:29,300 --> 02:11:30,890
mark,
but this isn't.

2895
02:11:31,190 --> 02:11:34,400
Now you're not on a bike trail.
This is the hardest ultra and the USA.

2896
02:11:34,520 --> 02:11:36,020
We need to document this.
We need.

2897
02:11:36,021 --> 02:11:39,110
This is 200 miles of this and if you try
to run,

2898
02:11:39,210 --> 02:11:43,070
here's what I learned with ultra is if 
you try to run where it's super steep,

2899
02:11:43,100 --> 02:11:45,020
all you're doing is gonna blow your legs
out.

2900
02:11:45,500 --> 02:11:46,333
I mean,
so you have to get good hiking tooth 

2901
02:11:47,990 --> 02:11:51,350
because you hiked the super steep stuff 
or this isn't even runnable really,

2902
02:11:51,570 --> 02:11:52,403
but you don't want even want to try.
So it's all about being efficient in 

2903
02:11:55,311 --> 02:11:57,650
managing,
managing your resource,

2904
02:11:57,830 --> 02:12:00,240
but it's,
it's a test that's a,

2905
02:12:00,530 --> 02:12:01,880
to put it mildly.
Yeah.

2906
02:12:01,910 --> 02:12:05,240
So I mean that.
I don't know,

2907
02:12:05,270 --> 02:12:07,100
this is what I live for,
but listen dude,

2908
02:12:07,101 --> 02:12:07,934
there's a problem and that is that this 
is in August and you need to be healthy 

2909
02:12:10,701 --> 02:12:13,720
and September because we got to go back.
We're bowhunting temper.

2910
02:12:14,200 --> 02:12:15,033
It's all mental.
Mental Madison is definitely some 

2911
02:12:18,891 --> 02:12:20,720
physical involved in that.
Yeah.

2912
02:12:21,070 --> 02:12:24,050
People have completed it.
I Dunno what,

2913
02:12:24,410 --> 02:12:25,243
what does that one nutty run that you 
told me about that very few people know 

2914
02:12:27,771 --> 02:12:30,730
about the Barclays.
Have you heard about this?

2915
02:12:30,740 --> 02:12:31,700
Yeah,
that's intense.

2916
02:12:31,820 --> 02:12:33,590
What is that?
That's like A.

2917
02:12:33,890 --> 02:12:35,840
I don't even know if there's really a 
course.

2918
02:12:35,990 --> 02:12:36,823
You know,
they have

2919
02:12:36,980 --> 02:12:38,010
snow course.
It's a,

2920
02:12:38,020 --> 02:12:39,200
it's really loose.
They don't,

2921
02:12:39,250 --> 02:12:40,640
it's not marked.
You can get lost.

2922
02:12:40,641 --> 02:12:41,540
You have to have your own map.

2923
02:12:41,650 --> 02:12:42,610
Oh Great.
Yeah.

2924
02:12:42,611 --> 02:12:46,240
It's.
And it's something like 64 miles maybe,

2925
02:12:46,510 --> 02:12:47,890
but it's like,
I mean,

2926
02:12:47,891 --> 02:12:50,440
you're in swamps it,
it's nasty.

2927
02:12:50,441 --> 02:12:51,274
I mean I think God,
it seems like for people finish or 

2928
02:12:53,891 --> 02:12:55,630
something,
they only allow in.

2929
02:12:56,650 --> 02:12:58,660
It's a small number.
Twelve 20.

2930
02:12:58,880 --> 02:13:00,920
I don't know that much about.
I've heard about it just yet.

2931
02:13:00,960 --> 02:13:03,420
Two people finish it each time.
Some people don't finish it.

2932
02:13:03,450 --> 02:13:04,283
Okay.
Five.

2933
02:13:04,590 --> 02:13:06,450
You do it like I,
if I remember correctly,

2934
02:13:06,451 --> 02:13:07,284
it's like one one way up during the day 
and you come back down at during the 

2935
02:13:11,031 --> 02:13:14,580
night and then you switch and go the 
opposite way the next day up and down.

2936
02:13:14,581 --> 02:13:16,800
And then if you can make it to that 
fifth turn,

2937
02:13:17,260 --> 02:13:18,930
it's all.
And it's also the same kind of way.

2938
02:13:18,931 --> 02:13:20,550
It's nonstop.
If you want to sleep,

2939
02:13:20,551 --> 02:13:21,384
you sleep.
You only have I think a window of like 

2940
02:13:22,921 --> 02:13:25,620
36 hours total to finish the whole thing
if you can make it.

2941
02:13:25,710 --> 02:13:26,580
Yeah.
I mean if you don't,

2942
02:13:26,581 --> 02:13:27,990
maybe 48 hours.
But yeah,

2943
02:13:27,991 --> 02:13:29,790
it's.
You got your eye on that fucking thing.

2944
02:13:30,660 --> 02:13:31,493
I don't know.
I mean that to me the navigation is a 

2945
02:13:36,301 --> 02:13:37,950
whole different animal.
You know,

2946
02:13:37,951 --> 02:13:39,840
I want to be able to.
I want to be prepared.

2947
02:13:40,020 --> 02:13:41,820
I want to know where the course is 
roughly.

2948
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,070
You know what I mean?
I don't really want to waste time having

2949
02:13:44,071 --> 02:13:47,130
to read a map and a compass.
That's a whole different challenge,

2950
02:13:47,160 --> 02:13:49,440
which maybe I'll get to that at some 
point.

2951
02:13:49,441 --> 02:13:54,050
Right now I just want to run 200 miles.
I want to run it that race as fast as it

2952
02:13:54,051 --> 02:13:56,670
has been run.
I don't know if that.

2953
02:13:56,671 --> 02:13:59,250
I don't know what I'm going to do.
I don't know what my body's going to do,

2954
02:13:59,400 --> 02:14:01,080
but I want to find out and I'm looking 
forward to it.

2955
02:14:01,260 --> 02:14:03,210
Wow.
That's intense,

2956
02:14:03,211 --> 02:14:03,600
man.

2957
02:14:03,600 --> 02:14:05,700
I'll be ready by tomorrow.
We should document it.

2958
02:14:05,880 --> 02:14:07,800
I should be looking at a range rover 
next to,

2959
02:14:07,801 --> 02:14:09,300
you know,
that's conditioned.

2960
02:14:09,790 --> 02:14:11,240
Sipping lemonade.
Yeah.

2961
02:14:11,280 --> 02:14:13,260
Control a drone.
A drone.

2962
02:14:13,350 --> 02:14:15,040
So yeah.
No,

2963
02:14:15,510 --> 02:14:16,350
I'm pretty.
Yeah,

2964
02:14:16,380 --> 02:14:18,240
it's neat.
How does someone document that you would

2965
02:14:18,241 --> 02:14:19,074
have to have gopros on or something like
that because someone has to go with you 

2966
02:14:21,250 --> 02:14:22,650
that people have talked about filming 
it.

2967
02:14:22,651 --> 02:14:23,484
Maybe under armour will.
I'm not sure how they're going to do 

2968
02:14:24,811 --> 02:14:25,650
that.
I don't know.

2969
02:14:25,740 --> 02:14:28,290
You'd have to have some fucking savage 
that's willing to run it with you.

2970
02:14:28,320 --> 02:14:30,870
My brother,
I know my brother's going to run some of

2971
02:14:30,871 --> 02:14:32,490
it with me.
And he's a beast.

2972
02:14:33,370 --> 02:14:34,203
Yeah.
Yeah.

2973
02:14:34,470 --> 02:14:36,210
So He's a,
he runs,

2974
02:14:36,240 --> 02:14:40,350
he's done 100 before run in your family.
Yeah.

2975
02:14:40,351 --> 02:14:41,280
So He's,
he's tough.

2976
02:14:41,281 --> 02:14:42,114
Dad was like a.
What was your dad wouldn't track and 

2977
02:14:44,221 --> 02:14:45,210
field athlete as well?

2978
02:14:45,270 --> 02:14:46,200
Yeah,
he was,

2979
02:14:46,250 --> 02:14:46,740
you know,
my,

2980
02:14:46,740 --> 02:14:50,700
my dad was a,
I'm not athletic.

2981
02:14:50,730 --> 02:14:55,730
My Dad was a freak and uh,
he had full scholarships at Oregon,

2982
02:14:56,521 --> 02:15:00,120
Oregon State for track and field and 
gymnastics to different sports.

2983
02:15:00,270 --> 02:15:03,510
He's pretty tall for a gymnast.
He was around six foot tall,

2984
02:15:03,511 --> 02:15:07,050
but just crazy ability.
Um,

2985
02:15:08,090 --> 02:15:10,410
he was an amazing athlete so I didn't 
get that,

2986
02:15:10,470 --> 02:15:15,470
but maybe I got,
I got enough of it to be tough to see.

2987
02:15:15,840 --> 02:15:17,430
When people say that like,
well,

2988
02:15:17,431 --> 02:15:19,980
what have you attempted to do that's 
athletic wear?

2989
02:15:19,981 --> 02:15:21,300
You failed that.
Like people that say,

2990
02:15:21,301 --> 02:15:22,380
Oh,
I'm not a really good athlete.

2991
02:15:22,381 --> 02:15:23,214
Like what does a really good athlete and
someone who practices the techniques of 

2992
02:15:26,521 --> 02:15:28,740
whatever sport they're trying to do and 
gets really good at it.

2993
02:15:28,800 --> 02:15:29,611
Yeah,
I mean,

2994
02:15:29,611 --> 02:15:31,980
you're really good at running and you're
really good at bowhunting.

2995
02:15:32,190 --> 02:15:34,320
Bonnie is absolutely athletic,
right?

2996
02:15:34,710 --> 02:15:37,200
It's like if,
if golf is a fucking sport,

2997
02:15:37,920 --> 02:15:41,070
what's Boeing is a problem with calling 
hunting a sport.

2998
02:15:41,071 --> 02:15:45,810
A lot of people out because I think it's
best described as a discipline because I

2999
02:15:45,811 --> 02:15:47,340
don't,
I don't like to think of it as something

3000
02:15:47,341 --> 02:15:48,600
that you score points.
I mean,

3001
02:15:48,601 --> 02:15:50,130
either I don't.
It's too trivial.

3002
02:15:50,180 --> 02:15:51,990
No,
it's too much of life.

3003
02:15:52,440 --> 02:15:53,580
But I do think,
uh,

3004
02:15:54,090 --> 02:15:57,430
there is athleticism within bowhunting 
hundred percent,

3005
02:15:57,740 --> 02:16:00,720
especially out west,
especially in the mountains in Alaska.

3006
02:16:01,140 --> 02:16:02,670
Um,
so yeah,

3007
02:16:02,671 --> 02:16:03,504
I mean,
I,

3008
02:16:04,450 --> 02:16:04,920
I,
I,

3009
02:16:04,920 --> 02:16:05,753
when I think when people think athlete,
they think to General the sports track 

3010
02:16:09,121 --> 02:16:10,440
and field football,
basketball,

3011
02:16:10,700 --> 02:16:11,700
you know,
things like that.

3012
02:16:11,701 --> 02:16:12,534
So,
I mean,

3013
02:16:12,540 --> 02:16:13,373
um,
I didn't get that elite athleticism in 

3014
02:16:15,391 --> 02:16:17,490
those sports as my dad did.
I mean,

3015
02:16:17,491 --> 02:16:20,130
I think he had the ability to make the 
Olympics.

3016
02:16:20,170 --> 02:16:21,990
Um,
but,

3017
02:16:22,260 --> 02:16:23,190
you know,
life happened.

3018
02:16:23,191 --> 02:16:25,740
I was born this or that,
so he was.

3019
02:16:25,800 --> 02:16:28,260
He was a freak and in what,
what you might.

3020
02:16:29,330 --> 02:16:30,550
Normal athletic

3021
02:16:30,580 --> 02:16:32,560
events,
maybe bowhunting,

3022
02:16:32,670 --> 02:16:33,940
you know,
qualifies on.

3023
02:16:34,020 --> 02:16:37,460
It's 100 percent qualifies.
Look at this fighting qualifiers,

3024
02:16:37,520 --> 02:16:38,890
athletics.
I think it does,

3025
02:16:38,950 --> 02:16:41,290
but it's way more intense than regular 
athletics.

3026
02:16:41,291 --> 02:16:42,124
It's something way more personal and 
dangerous about the goal of knocking 

3027
02:16:46,961 --> 02:16:49,760
someone unconscious while they're trying
to knock you unconscious and if,

3028
02:16:49,780 --> 02:16:51,490
if fighting,
if that counts.

3029
02:16:52,030 --> 02:16:55,060
That's athletics.
Bowhunting is most certainly athletics,

3030
02:16:55,061 --> 02:16:55,894
but I think we both agree that it's.
It's a little bit more intense than a 

3031
02:16:58,841 --> 02:16:59,770
sport.
Yeah,

3032
02:16:59,950 --> 02:17:01,000
definitely.
It's more,

3033
02:17:01,090 --> 02:17:04,460
it's almost disrespectful in a way.
Not.

3034
02:17:04,510 --> 02:17:05,650
I mean,
if you consider it a sport,

3035
02:17:05,651 --> 02:17:06,670
you call it a sport,
that's fine,

3036
02:17:06,671 --> 02:17:07,504
but in my view,
it's so much about the life and the 

3037
02:17:11,621 --> 02:17:13,810
reverence for this animal that you hunt 
an intake.

3038
02:17:14,440 --> 02:17:15,273
It's not.
It's not.

3039
02:17:15,970 --> 02:17:18,520
We won the superbowl,
we scored the goal.

3040
02:17:18,550 --> 02:17:19,383
The ball went in.
The hole is the journey is the journey 

3041
02:17:22,091 --> 02:17:23,310
is not just a punch tags.

3042
02:17:23,310 --> 02:17:24,370
So the Punch tag,
you'd say,

3043
02:17:24,610 --> 02:17:25,750
well I won.
Yeah,

3044
02:17:26,140 --> 02:17:26,973
I won.
So in a sport there's a winner and the 

3045
02:17:28,721 --> 02:17:30,130
loser,
you kill the animal,

3046
02:17:30,131 --> 02:17:31,060
you punch your,
tag,

3047
02:17:31,061 --> 02:17:32,740
you one.
That's not it.

3048
02:17:32,800 --> 02:17:34,910
I mean it's,
it's the whole journey that lease it.

3049
02:17:34,960 --> 02:17:35,793
And then also we talk about the getting 
the meat home and providing for your 

3050
02:17:38,891 --> 02:17:41,190
family,
how do you score that you can.

3051
02:17:41,200 --> 02:17:42,033
So yeah,
it's not a sport in that regard for 

3052
02:17:43,541 --> 02:17:44,374
sure.
There's,

3053
02:17:45,430 --> 02:17:48,610
it's a discipline and even that word is 
like,

3054
02:17:48,611 --> 02:17:52,150
it's Bonnie is bowhunting man.
That's what it is.

3055
02:17:52,290 --> 02:17:53,220
Yeah,
it's on the song.

3056
02:17:53,250 --> 02:17:55,150
It's not a tone.
It's got its own thing.

3057
02:17:55,300 --> 02:17:57,310
And on that note,
you got to catch a flight.

3058
02:17:57,350 --> 02:17:58,300
My brother.
I do.

3059
02:17:58,390 --> 02:17:59,223
Thank you again.
So much fun to hang out even just for a 

3060
02:18:01,810 --> 02:18:02,643
few hours.
It was great to hang out with you in 

3061
02:18:02,771 --> 02:18:05,830
salt lake and wander around all those 
freaks and dead animals.

3062
02:18:06,340 --> 02:18:07,660
Uh,
all right folks,

3063
02:18:07,661 --> 02:18:10,510
we'll be back tomorrow with my brother 
Doug Derryn,

3064
02:18:11,380 --> 02:18:15,190
Wednesday boss Rutan and Mall Rinella.
Ooh,

3065
02:18:15,250 --> 02:18:16,083
that's going to be fun.
The original team from one of the 

3066
02:18:17,741 --> 02:18:20,440
original teams from pride broadcasting,
two great guys.

3067
02:18:20,920 --> 02:18:22,870
Morrows an awesome dude.
Um,

3068
02:18:22,890 --> 02:18:25,270
and bosses the best and of course on 
Friday,

3069
