1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,620
The general good experience,
here's how so,

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:08,060
so I've got just about been open for
nine years with CSA.

3
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:10,890
We had zero members when we started.
I've got about $1,300,

4
00:00:10,891 --> 00:00:15,600
which was the motivation.
What made you the motivation was that I

5
00:00:15,601 --> 00:00:17,640
spent.
It was always a passion.

6
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,100
I was doing martial arts when I was a
child that was fighting.

7
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:25,130
I just wasn't making money doing it and
then I got into that other life and did

8
00:00:25,681 --> 00:00:30,681
that for about 15 years and I was being
paid to protect people that could afford

9
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:33,450
it but maybe didn't deserve it for a
very long time.

10
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:36,720
And unfortunately that's the way it
works is if you can afford it,

11
00:00:36,721 --> 00:00:39,280
you probably don't deserve it.
That's a funny way of looking at.

12
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:40,110
Yeah.
And it's,

13
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,390
it's a,
it's a true way of looking at it because

14
00:00:42,391 --> 00:00:43,940
I was doing it at the highest level,
you know,

15
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:48,210
I wasn't doing security work at the
kids' choice awards,

16
00:00:48,211 --> 00:00:53,211
standing Jim Carey for two hours saying
I'm Jim Carey's bodyguard.

17
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:56,670
Right.
So it's one of those things where I saw

18
00:00:56,671 --> 00:00:59,850
it at the very highest level and it
just,

19
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:02,770
it turned me off after awhile because
you know,

20
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:03,800
you're just,
you're,

21
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:06,030
you're being a babysitter to people who
have money.

22
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:09,810
Even with the biggest threats from Iraq,
Afghanistan,

23
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:14,370
a Haiti run down the list.
It wasn't about helping people and I was

24
00:01:14,371 --> 00:01:16,380
wanting to help people.
So I get it.

25
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:17,940
When I,
when I opened the gym,

26
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:20,830
that was the goal was to help people and
it,

27
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:24,960
it turned into that gym.
And this is why I feel that our gym

28
00:01:24,961 --> 00:01:29,910
model is successful is because tonight
at 5:30 during a boxing class,

29
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:34,230
my professional fighters are going to be
in class with everyone else.

30
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,860
There's no protein,
only practice.

31
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,980
Everybody trains together.
Everybody works together.

32
00:01:40,981 --> 00:01:44,550
The model is for people.
You want to get in shape,

33
00:01:44,551 --> 00:01:45,990
wonderful.
You're going to get into shape.

34
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:47,700
You want to have stress relief.
Wonderful.

35
00:01:47,701 --> 00:01:49,380
You want to become a fighter?
Wonderful.

36
00:01:49,381 --> 00:01:52,920
I don't have a fight team practice try
out or any of that.

37
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,660
You come to the gym,
you put in the work,

38
00:01:54,661 --> 00:01:56,820
you support the team,
you trained side by side with world

39
00:01:56,821 --> 00:01:57,780
champions,
you get better,

40
00:01:57,781 --> 00:02:00,540
you have a good time.
It's a huge family gym.

41
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:05,100
It's a huge family environment and the
mixture of the self defense and the

42
00:02:05,101 --> 00:02:09,150
fighting and the fitness one doesn't
need the other.

43
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:14,300
So unlike like an Aka and I love hobby,
but the gym is about the fighters.

44
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,050
Fighters lose.
That's a fight.

45
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,860
People go out the back door,
right?

46
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,500
For me,
I kind of a fight or lose,

47
00:02:19,501 --> 00:02:22,020
my membership's not going to matter,
but people are still gonna come,

48
00:02:22,021 --> 00:02:23,940
they're still going to train,
they're still gonna support.

49
00:02:23,941 --> 00:02:26,670
They're still going to buy tickets and
that's been the recipe.

50
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:30,900
And because the gym is that way,
it's allowed me to have this model where

51
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:34,170
I don't charge pro fighters.
You're remarkably normal.

52
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,273
Oh,
thanks.

53
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:38,720
I know people restricted at how normal I
am.

54
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:39,631
Just like,
wow.

55
00:02:39,631 --> 00:02:42,370
Really?
I think my reputation through maze,

56
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:46,890
a famous child,
that's a very unusual maze.

57
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:47,870
Uh,
yeah.

58
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,470
Uh,
my life is unique to me.

59
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:51,140
That's what I like to say.
And uh,

60
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:54,540
I'm almost got peerless person,
like to a certain extent,

61
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:56,850
there's not too many people I can look
left and right.

62
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,640
And we,
you know,

63
00:02:58,641 --> 00:02:59,110
I,
I,

64
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,760
like,
we have similar experiences.

65
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:03,310
Is there anybody that you ever
contacted,

66
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:08,370
like Jodie foster or someone who's made
it through and seems pretty put

67
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:10,270
together?
Not really,

68
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,530
no,
not really.

69
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,810
I mean,
it's kind of a weird cold call,

70
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,130
you know?
Hey,

71
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:20,620
Jodie foster,
such a small clan people,

72
00:03:20,621 --> 00:03:24,220
like if a comic called me that I knew
they wanted to talk to me,

73
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,190
I would talk to them because it's such a
small club of people.

74
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,290
I mean we do have our weekly therapy
sessions.

75
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:29,840
Yeah.
Yeah.

76
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,220
You know me,
Elijah Wood,

77
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,680
Jodie Foster,
you know.

78
00:03:35,681 --> 00:03:37,270
Yeah.
Like we all get together and yeah,

79
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:38,220
we,
we,

80
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,550
we,
we've actually,

81
00:03:39,551 --> 00:03:41,290
we do primal screaming.
That's what we do.

82
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,410
I was describing what it was like.
I have a friend who,

83
00:03:44,411 --> 00:03:46,220
uh,
Ricky Schroder who uh,

84
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:47,163
is,
um,

85
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,700
you know,
obviously it was a very famous when he

86
00:03:48,701 --> 00:03:51,280
was young as well.
And one of my favorite theme songs,

87
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:56,160
TV theme songs of all time.
And I was saying like you,

88
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:59,800
the way you developed is not like the
way the recipe calls,

89
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:04,540
like the recipe calls for you to have a
childhood and try to figure out life and

90
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:08,080
then become a man and trying to find
yourself and then try to find your path.

91
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:12,220
And by the time you he became a man,
he was already famous.

92
00:04:12,221 --> 00:04:13,420
And the same thing with you.

93
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:17,650
You were already famous as you were
developing and learning.

94
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:22,180
Yeah.
I don't know exactly how to like kind of

95
00:04:22,181 --> 00:04:27,181
even describe it because it's always the
way my life has been kind of thing in

96
00:04:27,581 --> 00:04:29,190
the same way that like a lot of kids,
like,

97
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:32,200
you know,
they'd go out and they catch bugs and

98
00:04:32,201 --> 00:04:35,950
play sandlot baseball or whatever.
You just look at it like that's the way

99
00:04:35,951 --> 00:04:38,380
it is.
Like you don't really realize how unique

100
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:41,350
the whole situation is until you have
perspective because you have nothing to

101
00:04:41,351 --> 00:04:45,340
compare it to really other than I guess
tv shows and movies and things like

102
00:04:45,341 --> 00:04:48,250
that.
So I knew that my upbringing was unique,

103
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,440
you know?
I knew it knew it was different,

104
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:54,190
but at the same time it's kind of just,
it's not until you get some perspective,

105
00:04:54,191 --> 00:04:56,860
some life experience,
but until you really realize that,

106
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:57,610
oh wait,
this,

107
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:58,470
this was particularly.
Yeah.

108
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:01,240
Weird.
So you brought up an interesting what

109
00:05:01,241 --> 00:05:06,241
would leopold and
leopold this disciple,

110
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:09,490
you know,
father of modern wildlife ecology,

111
00:05:09,491 --> 00:05:14,491
started the first program of Wildlife
Ecology at University of Wisconsin in

112
00:05:14,621 --> 00:05:19,621
the 19 forties,
populations of deer in the northern part

113
00:05:20,651 --> 00:05:23,950
of Wisconsin.
We're growing by leaps and bounds and

114
00:05:23,951 --> 00:05:26,440
they were dramatically changing the
landscape,

115
00:05:26,441 --> 00:05:28,060
you know,
denuding the landscape,

116
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:30,820
you know,
eating eastern white cedar and deer in

117
00:05:30,821 --> 00:05:33,970
northern latitudes tend to yard together
in the wintertime.

118
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:37,470
And so leopold knew that this was,
you know,

119
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,490
deleterious to the longterm viability of
that ecosystem.

120
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,480
He took people out,
landowners out hunters out into these

121
00:05:46,481 --> 00:05:50,740
deer yards in the spring to show them
how there was nothing to eat within

122
00:05:50,741 --> 00:05:54,760
reach of a deer on its hind feet.
And there were bodies of dead deer that

123
00:05:54,761 --> 00:05:58,370
had stopped through the wintertime in
order to demonstrate to them the

124
00:05:58,371 --> 00:06:01,640
consequences of mismanagement if deer
hurts.

125
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,620
So he and he was a real proponent of
showing people the results of doing

126
00:06:06,621 --> 00:06:09,750
things the wrong way and education.
So I think yeah,

127
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,140
it comes back.
So what we're trying to do,

128
00:06:12,141 --> 00:06:15,680
not saying that yeah,
we're leopold in or anything like that,

129
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:19,670
but education,
getting information out,

130
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,760
getting accurate information out.
It's maybe one of the biggest things we

131
00:06:22,761 --> 00:06:23,510
can do.

132
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:27,590
Like no one ever feels like they're
anything special and you always like if

133
00:06:27,591 --> 00:06:31,160
there were any good they don't know.
And you always ruthlessly self critical

134
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,950
and trying to get better.
I mean I've worked with big actors,

135
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:38,720
big,
Big Rock Stars and the big rockstars,

136
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:41,660
like one big rockstar once one time said
to me,

137
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:42,890
I opened.
He said,

138
00:06:42,891 --> 00:06:44,660
is there anyone out there?
I said,

139
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:49,690
ah,
like 19,000 people smell the wd 40.

140
00:06:50,901 --> 00:06:52,790
That's how they got the last thousand
people in.

141
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,130
Are you kidding?
He said,

142
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,910
I'm always worried that no one's going
to show up.

143
00:06:55,911 --> 00:06:59,180
I said,
when was that ever been your problem?

144
00:06:59,330 --> 00:06:59,931
He said,
well,

145
00:06:59,931 --> 00:07:01,460
never,
but who is this?

146
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:05,110
Jesus Christ.
Yeah.

147
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,280
Who's this one of my favorite people.
He's a.

148
00:07:08,281 --> 00:07:11,570
So He's another guy.
He's honest,

149
00:07:11,571 --> 00:07:16,571
how many people have those
were like in some Floridian,

150
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,900
mega done.
Hopefully won't be anyone other than

151
00:07:21,901 --> 00:07:21,990
him.

152
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:22,611
Oh No,
no,

153
00:07:22,611 --> 00:07:22,991
no,
no,

154
00:07:22,991 --> 00:07:23,450
no,
no.

155
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:26,990
And he goes out there and the place goes
nuts to show is great of course.

156
00:07:26,991 --> 00:07:28,660
And I said,
you worry about people don't show up.

157
00:07:28,661 --> 00:07:31,520
I get really depressed.
And I went,

158
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:34,700
okay.
And you know what?

159
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:37,850
I did the beacon theater once many years
ago in New York.

160
00:07:37,851 --> 00:07:39,350
Beautiful Room.
Loved that place.

161
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,130
I was,
uh,

162
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,053
I was,
uh,

163
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,840
a few days later I was at mtv doing
something with like Matt Pinfield or

164
00:07:47,841 --> 00:07:51,020
somebody that was living in New York and
I'm leaving.

165
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:53,450
And the courtesy lady,
she said,

166
00:07:53,451 --> 00:07:56,600
Hey,
George Carlin is in the green room and

167
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,210
he wants to meet you.
And I went,

168
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,260
wait a minute,
dumb question.

169
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:02,990
The George Carlin,
because I've been listening to that guy

170
00:08:02,991 --> 00:08:07,190
since I was an eighth grade class clown
and occupation fool actually came out

171
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,700
for me to go to the record store.
They were not nice price records.

172
00:08:10,701 --> 00:08:12,020
They were what was on.

173
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:15,320
That's how old I am memorized.
And by eighth grade of course.

174
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,360
And I said,
George Carlin wants to meet me.

175
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,800
Okay,
walk in,

176
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:21,920
and there's George Carlin,
he's there to promote his next hbo thing

177
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:25,640
and he's going to do like,
like multiple nights at the beacon

178
00:08:25,641 --> 00:08:27,140
theater place.
I would never sell out.

179
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:30,140
He's going to do a month or whatever.
And he said,

180
00:08:30,141 --> 00:08:30,670
Hey,
I'm.

181
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:31,810
I said,
Mr Carlos [inaudible].

182
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,020
I'm George.
I'm like,

183
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,150
wow.
He said,

184
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,890
Oh,
you did a book signing the other night

185
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,540
at tower records?
I said,

186
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:38,901
yeah.
He goes,

187
00:08:38,901 --> 00:08:40,180
oh man.
It was so cool.

188
00:08:40,181 --> 00:08:43,280
I was in line for like half an hour and
finally I got so cold.

189
00:08:43,281 --> 00:08:45,020
I went home.
I said,

190
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:47,480
you waited in line to meet me?
He's like,

191
00:08:47,481 --> 00:08:48,530
yeah.
I'm like,

192
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,210
why don't you just walk in like,
oh,

193
00:08:50,211 --> 00:08:52,360
I can't do that man.
And

194
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,680
he said,
so you just at the beacon?

195
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,281
I said,
yeah.

196
00:08:56,281 --> 00:08:57,630
It was amazing.
He said,

197
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,270
did they get the jokes?
I said,

198
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,970
oh,
that's not really what I do.

199
00:09:02,971 --> 00:09:03,721
I said,
I'm sorry,

200
00:09:03,721 --> 00:09:05,100
what do you mean?
He goes,

201
00:09:05,101 --> 00:09:06,310
like,
Dee Dee Dee,

202
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,670
can you get to the audience from that
stage?

203
00:09:08,671 --> 00:09:10,890
I said,
it's actually a pretty big place.

204
00:09:10,891 --> 00:09:14,100
It's a lot his feet to before the first
row I said,

205
00:09:14,101 --> 00:09:14,610
yeah.
I said,

206
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:16,890
you're George Carlin.
I think you're going to do okay.

207
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:21,060
But he was sincerely wondering like,
is it going to be okay in there?

208
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,890
I'm like,
are you kidding?

209
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:27,840
You were handcuffed with lenny bruce in
the back of a cop car and you're asking

210
00:09:27,841 --> 00:09:30,570
me if it's going to be okay.
Was He handcuffed?

211
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,400
Yeah,
it's that great book.

212
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,600
A great book.
Uh,

213
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,060
Ladies and gentlemen,
Lenny Bruce,

214
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:37,750
Alex Jones cannot now go,
well,

215
00:09:37,751 --> 00:09:40,100
just go to the other youtube.
There isn't another residential.

216
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,650
You Hey,
just go to the other facebook.

217
00:09:41,651 --> 00:09:44,590
There isn't another.
So we have to recognize that the way we

218
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:49,080
are organized as a society that the town
square is now owned by corporations who

219
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,580
that need to be regulated.
Right?

220
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:53,830
Like before,
if you know when 18 t was the phone

221
00:09:53,831 --> 00:09:55,510
carrier for everybody,
they couldn't go.

222
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:58,370
I'm not going to give Alex Jones a phone
service because I don't like the Shit

223
00:09:58,371 --> 00:10:00,320
shitty saying.
So you know,

224
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:02,110
we,
you can't deny services somebody,

225
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:05,080
all that stuff.
Just that's not really a valid

226
00:10:05,081 --> 00:10:08,980
comparison because the phone service
wasn't distributed information to

227
00:10:08,981 --> 00:10:09,920
people,
right?

228
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:12,010
The phone service is just a method of
communication.

229
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:16,510
It was just a utility.
What he's able to do through info wars

230
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:20,380
is if you've got them on your platform,
he's going to say some things and he's

231
00:10:20,381 --> 00:10:23,490
going to use your platform to say some
things that you know,

232
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,460
might not be true.

233
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:27,370
It might be crazy.
So you've got to decide like when does

234
00:10:27,371 --> 00:10:30,280
it become a problem?
And I think where they drew the line

235
00:10:30,281 --> 00:10:32,140
with Sandy Hook.
So here's what I say,

236
00:10:32,141 --> 00:10:33,120
Joe,
uh,

237
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:37,060
we need to treat these as public
utilities because they are right

238
00:10:37,061 --> 00:10:38,860
facebook,
there is no alternative.

239
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,590
There is an alternative to youtube.
We need to regulate them.

240
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:42,910
Well,
it's a long overdue by the way.

241
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:46,640
And they are monopolies where there's
obvious to everyone that they're

242
00:10:46,641 --> 00:10:47,860
monopolies.
But you know,

243
00:10:47,861 --> 00:10:49,420
when you,
when you invent something called

244
00:10:49,421 --> 00:10:51,610
whatsapp and then facebook buys it for
$20,

245
00:10:51,611 --> 00:10:53,860
billion dollars,
there's a monopoly,

246
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:55,720
there's no way.
There's no way to,

247
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:58,270
to compete with these people.
So these are monopolies.

248
00:10:58,271 --> 00:11:02,780
They need to be regulated and people's
need to be protected and it it,

249
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:03,970
it.
That's how.

250
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,690
That's where we need to go because right
now we're leaving it up to the whims of

251
00:11:07,691 --> 00:11:08,050
a billion.

252
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:08,711
Like you'd say,
Hey,

253
00:11:08,711 --> 00:11:11,980
if Alex Jones really did some shit that
was wrong and he should be taken off,

254
00:11:11,981 --> 00:11:14,140
or his free speech should be a bridge
for it,

255
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:15,760
do it.
Let's do it.

256
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:18,560
Go,
go to a court or go to a thing or go.

257
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,151
People go,
well,

258
00:11:19,151 --> 00:11:22,180
he docks his people and he did it is if
doxing is illegal,

259
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:24,700
he should be prosecuted.
If that's what happened,

260
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,020
but you shouldn't take away.
Did he docs people?

261
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,510
That's what they're saying.
They're saying he's done.

262
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:32,830
He'd wanted he docs people from newtown
or whatever from the school shooting,

263
00:11:32,831 --> 00:11:35,740
so that's what they're talking about.
The individuals that he gave their

264
00:11:35,741 --> 00:11:38,170
addresses and their names.
That's what they are saying,

265
00:11:38,171 --> 00:11:40,630
that he decay,
but let's find out if he actually did

266
00:11:40,631 --> 00:11:42,790
that because that sounds crazy.
I,

267
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:43,400
I,
I'm,

268
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,390
I don't know if he did,
but we did not saying what he actually

269
00:11:46,391 --> 00:11:46,690
did.

270
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:51,490
This is what's crazy.
I keep hearing that he promoted the idea

271
00:11:51,491 --> 00:11:56,491
that sandy hook was a false,
it was false and that it was a false

272
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:02,260
flag and that these were all actors.
I don't know if he actually said that.

273
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:06,610
I think what he actually said was,
I don't know if that happened.

274
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:09,460
I think that's what he actually said.
People are saying,

275
00:12:09,461 --> 00:12:12,040
well,
that's promoting the idea that it was a

276
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:14,860
hoax,
but I want to know if that's what he

277
00:12:14,861 --> 00:12:15,641
really said.
See,

278
00:12:15,641 --> 00:12:18,010
I don't know if that's even the case
because I've heard it.

279
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:22,930
I've heard it written that he promoted
the idea that sandy hook was a

280
00:12:22,931 --> 00:12:24,910
conspiracy,
but I did not quoting.

281
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:27,790
When they say that there's no quotes,
there's no.

282
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:31,390
Sandy Hook was a hoax.
Those kids were actors.

283
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:34,270
Those kids are not dead.
I don't see that anywhere.

284
00:12:34,271 --> 00:12:36,670
Right,
but they keep attributing that to him

285
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:37,750
without quotation.

286
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:38,680
But again,
if this.

287
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,430
If there was some kind of process due
process where you could go back and look

288
00:12:42,431 --> 00:12:43,970
at the transcript.
I know this.

289
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,020
Not only that,
if during this whole time where he's

290
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:49,120
being tried,
he was still labeled to be on youtube

291
00:12:49,121 --> 00:12:52,630
and have his videos,
he could show in his videos that he

292
00:12:52,631 --> 00:12:56,620
didn't say that he could show what he
actually said and tell you what he

293
00:12:56,621 --> 00:12:59,980
actually said and show clips.
He can't do that anymore.

294
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:03,970
So now the narrative is completely in
the hands of the mainstream media.

295
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,640
One hundred percent.
So the Alex Jones narrative is being

296
00:13:06,641 --> 00:13:10,990
taken 100 percent out of his hands and
now it's in the mainstream media.

297
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:15,280
And now there's sandy hook deniers,
conspiracy theorists,

298
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:17,740
right wing lunatic,
all these different things.

299
00:13:17,741 --> 00:13:19,000
Which mayor,
if some of it.

300
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,460
I mean Alex,
my fucking nuts.
