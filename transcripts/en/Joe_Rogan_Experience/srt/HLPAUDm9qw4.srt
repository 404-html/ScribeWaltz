1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,040
The Joe Rogan experience,
let's take like just one small example

2
00:00:04,041 --> 00:00:06,710
of how my belief system works about
this.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,660
Uh,
there's this one thing called the

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,660
accumulation mindset.
I call it a,

5
00:00:11,661 --> 00:00:16,661
I work online with people on fat loss
programs and when you really look at

6
00:00:18,291 --> 00:00:21,690
their lifestyle,
their into the cumulation mode of just

7
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:23,510
buying an,
amassing all this stuff.

8
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:27,770
I've been in some people's homes where
the shelves are just littered with stuff

9
00:00:27,771 --> 00:00:30,230
they never use or,
or don't need,

10
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:30,870
you know,
they,

11
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:33,410
they just have so much stuff.
The attic is full of stuff.

12
00:00:33,411 --> 00:00:36,050
That garage is full of stuff,
but they keep buying more and more.

13
00:00:36,051 --> 00:00:36,920
Adding,
adding,

14
00:00:36,921 --> 00:00:37,754
adding,
adding.

15
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:42,560
Their bodies reflect this type of belief
system and for sure they're adding more

16
00:00:42,561 --> 00:00:45,710
cells under their agent.
Just indulgent,

17
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:47,260
you know,
and then they find themselves over

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,080
eating,
eating more than their fair share of the

19
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,770
natural resources of the universe.
Taking more in A.

20
00:00:54,771 --> 00:00:59,771
I mean it's just like this whole belief
system in accumulation like I need to

21
00:01:00,081 --> 00:01:02,330
add,
I need to add is all subconscious.

22
00:01:02,331 --> 00:01:03,890
Of course,
no one goes into it,

23
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:05,840
you know,
how much do you sleep?

24
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,590
Maybe now that I'm doing all this crazy
stuff,

25
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:10,910
three hours,
three hours,

26
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,350
lot.
Wow.

27
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,290
What do you normally sleep if you
weren't doing this course?

28
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:15,770
If I'm lucky.
Wow.

29
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,870
Four hours.
Maybe we'll you're juiced up on nicotine

30
00:01:17,871 --> 00:01:18,530
all.
No,

31
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:20,750
it has to do with.
I have to worry the editing,

32
00:01:20,751 --> 00:01:23,000
like you know,
like I have to do the notes at night so

33
00:01:23,001 --> 00:01:26,390
that they can edit during the day and
then I go in at night and then now like

34
00:01:26,391 --> 00:01:28,370
with all these,
like with radio as you know,

35
00:01:28,371 --> 00:01:31,060
like radio and all this stuff.
It's like there's a weird schedule to

36
00:01:31,061 --> 00:01:33,680
all of that and then doing shows at
night because I never stopped doing

37
00:01:33,681 --> 00:01:34,660
shows.
Right.

38
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,610
Of course.
But I meant like when you're not doing

39
00:01:36,611 --> 00:01:39,310
this and you said five hours,
five hours maybe.

40
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,990
Is that because you're all juiced up
with nicotine?

41
00:01:40,991 --> 00:01:43,270
All the time?
I think as I'm old and my prostate tells

42
00:01:43,271 --> 00:01:44,800
me it's time to get up,
take a leak.

43
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:48,070
Five hours and you're good.
If I'm lucky,

44
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:50,440
you know,
get some palm palm juice.

45
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,190
Have you tried some of those pills that
help?

46
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,810
What is this Dr Oz.

47
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:59,690
It's like we were just watching heavy
metal and there's like a,

48
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,030
a Caribou carcass here.
It's like,

49
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:05,420
have you ever thought of like who gives
a shit?

50
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:08,150
It's part of getting old guys get used
to it,

51
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:10,400
get used to it.
Joe,

52
00:02:10,401 --> 00:02:12,350
you're old enough to start now and not
have any.

53
00:02:12,351 --> 00:02:16,040
Probably any problems from smoking.
You'll try it out for a year.

54
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:21,100
You would never have anybody who was an
athlete in their youth or like stole.

55
00:02:21,321 --> 00:02:23,910
Is involved in athletics.
Like smoking is a.

56
00:02:23,911 --> 00:02:25,670
no,
my cardio is very important to me.

57
00:02:25,671 --> 00:02:26,211
Yeah,
yeah,

58
00:02:26,211 --> 00:02:27,220
I understand that.
You know,

59
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:30,910
I'd never fuck around with that.
I do love like a,

60
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,450
you know,
smokers do like,

61
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,330
I'm just talking about like my dad and
his friends,

62
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:38,360
they would have amazing smoker
superpowers where it's like,

63
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,970
no,
they couldn't do anything but like if

64
00:02:40,971 --> 00:02:42,140
there was something like,
you know,

65
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,490
hey,
I need your help.

66
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,310
What happened?
My car fell in a ditch and like they

67
00:02:46,311 --> 00:02:48,100
would just like come out with a
cigarette in their mouth and like,

68
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:49,020
lift up.
I was like,

69
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:50,870
man,
that's so cool.

70
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:53,150
You know,
there's a diaper that they're selling

71
00:02:53,151 --> 00:02:53,984
now.
Tony,

72
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,400
Tony Boucher,
for a lot of times a menu you fucking

73
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:00,220
get a little drippage is a Tampon word
the front of your diaper

74
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:03,250
because you're directly manpower and
they're trying to sell it as like a

75
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:04,810
normal thing.
Meanwhile,

76
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:09,840
this guy with this swollen,
inflated gut filled with undigested food

77
00:03:11,711 --> 00:03:14,740
and feces that hasn't been pushed out
yet.

78
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:19,980
Fat that permeates all the different
layers of his skin and muscle left under

79
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:22,461
that.
I'm muscles.

80
00:03:22,461 --> 00:03:25,920
They're all gone.
I'm here to throw you that my big game,

81
00:03:25,921 --> 00:03:29,500
broken dixon leaking.
Trust me.

82
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:31,240
Just wear a Tampon.
Keep reading them.

83
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:34,000
Fucking meatball subs deletion.
Fuck

84
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,500
balls,
balls inside.

85
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:41,680
They got Monica got.
They got good to got the good peppers

86
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:44,780
they put on the top day society.
My mother,

87
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,970
God bless her,
she died of a heart attack at 51.

88
00:03:48,971 --> 00:03:52,720
She weighed 300 pounds.
He's the guy driving the truck that

89
00:03:52,721 --> 00:03:57,670
beep,
that fucking God had and got my fucking

90
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,670
pepper.
Got My meatballs.

91
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:05,770
I know when I walk my fat on my feet
spills over the outside of my sneakers.

92
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:08,270
I like that.
That looks like a little waterfall to

93
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,660
get into my heel lift.
When I stepped down,

94
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:14,110
just
rolls over.

95
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:19,050
I liked a lot because my fucking guns,
my gun sticking out.

96
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:23,440
My legs can't stay the way the back of
my head looks to the hot dog roll.

97
00:04:23,441 --> 00:04:26,470
Look,
I like fat sausages that are growing out

98
00:04:26,471 --> 00:04:29,980
of the base of my skull.
Just you look certainly makes you hungry

99
00:04:29,981 --> 00:04:34,050
for the fucking the either the fucker in
source.

100
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:37,840
Each
look at my face.

101
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:42,190
You see a wrinkle in my face.
You see any spider remarks by my eyes?

102
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:45,580
Fuck no,
because the flesh is pushing out against

103
00:04:45,581 --> 00:04:47,560
the skin all the time.
It's pulled tight.

104
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:51,900
It makes me look young and vibrant.
Look at my Chin's tight.

105
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:53,540
All of a diet.
Tell.

106
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:56,320
Tell a story about how,
how you wrote your training with our

107
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,300
Lawsky.
Oh,

108
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,660
after,
after training.

109
00:04:58,660 --> 00:04:59,620
Where he's.
He goes,

110
00:04:59,621 --> 00:05:00,550
come here.
Yeah.

111
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:01,361
Yeah.
So,

112
00:05:01,361 --> 00:05:03,880
uh,
Andre Arlovski and I used to train

113
00:05:03,881 --> 00:05:06,690
together Jackson's camp.
If I was getting ready for a fight this

114
00:05:06,691 --> 00:05:10,810
over shoot almost four years ago,
the two fighters that I,

115
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,420
when I first got into the game that I
admired and loved,

116
00:05:13,421 --> 00:05:16,090
we're Mirko Cro,
cop and Andre Arlovski,

117
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,910
my two very favorite.
That's who I wanted to be like.

118
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:22,870
So I walked into the gym and it was our
last skis first day at Jackson's too.

119
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:24,550
And uh,
you know,

120
00:05:24,551 --> 00:05:26,650
when you see a guy on tv fighting all
the time,

121
00:05:26,651 --> 00:05:27,940
then you run into me like,
damn,

122
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,050
all right.
So I see.

123
00:05:29,051 --> 00:05:29,741
I'm like,
Oh shit,

124
00:05:29,741 --> 00:05:33,070
there's under lawsky.
So then shopper last year in the ring,

125
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,600
a first day spine,
right,

126
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,400
fresh off the plane and we're sparring
with him.

127
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,730
So me and him are gone and it's a close
round.

128
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,740
He's a bad ass right?
And here we're going back and forth.

129
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:45,730
People would literally stop and watch
his spar with just these dog rounds back

130
00:05:45,731 --> 00:05:47,110
and forth,
five rounds in a row.

131
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,160
Then later that night we grapple and
then,

132
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,730
uh,
the next morning I drink coffee every

133
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:54,070
morning,
right?

134
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:56,500
Drinking coffee,
not this horrible coffee breath,

135
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,860
breath smelled like pure coffees.
Shit breath right now.

136
00:05:59,861 --> 00:06:03,830
You go up to Andre and he's not very
warm person at all.

137
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,530
Not at all.
Is that very bell Bruce Rush in where

138
00:06:06,531 --> 00:06:07,790
it's going to take awhile to be his
friend.

139
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:09,920
I can tell and I'm trying to break these
barriers.

140
00:06:09,921 --> 00:06:10,770
Fan.
I don't know.

141
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,010
Hey,
just wanna let you know man.

142
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:16,280
I got the coffee breath and he,
he didn't say a word to me the night

143
00:06:16,281 --> 00:06:18,230
before training goes.
It's okay.

144
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,720
It's okay.
Much better than yesterday.

145
00:06:20,721 --> 00:06:22,280
Yesterday.
Shit.

146
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,450
I go,
why?

147
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,240
He goes yesterday.
Breast smelled like shit.

148
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,880
Oh cool man.
Cool.

149
00:06:28,881 --> 00:06:31,820
And then just went about our business.
That was really the only words he ever

150
00:06:31,821 --> 00:06:32,610
said to me,
man.

151
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:35,180
And we trained together for for awhile.
It wasn't even like from it.

152
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,790
What about when you were kicking,
when you had your kick his body?

153
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,190
Yeah.
And then we'll get done training.

154
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:41,390
I've never done this.
He goes,

155
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,840
I'm trying to do my best Russian accent
it.

156
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:45,810
You guys are pretty much terrible.
Horrible,

157
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:46,700
right?
Sorry,

158
00:06:46,701 --> 00:06:48,950
I'm not from Russia.
He goes,

159
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:50,780
uh,
he was put your hands on top of your

160
00:06:50,781 --> 00:06:51,680
head like this.
And I'm like,

161
00:06:51,681 --> 00:06:53,120
what are we doing?
And we just got done sparring.

162
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm exhausted.
I put my hands up and he just goes,

163
00:06:56,030 --> 00:07:01,030
braced herself and starts wailing at my
body with kicks punches whalen is this

164
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:05,030
make you tough?
My okay.

165
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,380
And I'm like,
oh,

166
00:07:06,381 --> 00:07:08,020
I'll try and be tough though because
he's my hero.

167
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:08,721
I'm like,
oh,

168
00:07:08,721 --> 00:07:10,240
okay.
Oh Wow.

169
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:11,690
And then he goes,
my turn,

170
00:07:11,691 --> 00:07:13,340
you do it to me.
And I'm like,

171
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,030
Dooney,
no,

172
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:17,690
you hit like girl hit and I'm fucking
trying man.

173
00:07:17,691 --> 00:07:19,610
I'm trying to hurt this guy.
Nothing.

174
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,620
And that was my experience with Andre
Arlovski.
