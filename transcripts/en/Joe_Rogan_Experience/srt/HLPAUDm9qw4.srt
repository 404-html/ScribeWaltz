1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,500
The joe rogan experience.
Let's take like it's just one small

2
00:00:03,501 --> 00:00:06,710
example of like how my belief system
works about this.

3
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:08,690
Uh,
there's this one thing called the

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:10,580
accumulation mindset.
I call it,

5
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:14,450
uh,
I work online with people on fat loss

6
00:00:14,451 --> 00:00:19,160
programs and when you really look at
their lifestyle,

7
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:23,180
their into the z accumulation mode of
just buying an amassing all of this

8
00:00:23,181 --> 00:00:25,220
stuff.
I've been in some people's homes where

9
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:30,260
the shelves are just littered with stuff
they never use or don't need.

10
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:30,841
You know,
they,

11
00:00:30,841 --> 00:00:33,410
they just have so much stuff.
The attic is full of stuff,

12
00:00:33,411 --> 00:00:36,050
the garage is full of stuff,
but they keep buying more and more

13
00:00:36,051 --> 00:00:36,920
adding,
adding,

14
00:00:36,921 --> 00:00:37,754
adding,
adding.

15
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:42,560
The body's reflect this type of belief
system and for sure they're adding more

16
00:00:42,561 --> 00:00:45,710
cells under their body.
Just indulge it,

17
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:47,330
you know?
And then they find themselves over

18
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,110
eating,
eating more than their fair share of the

19
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,710
natural resources of the universe.
Taking more n a,

20
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:59,030
I mean it's just like this whole belief
system in accumulation.

21
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:02,330
Like I need to add,
I need to add is all subconscious.

22
00:01:02,331 --> 00:01:03,890
Of course,
no one goes into it.

23
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:05,810
You know,
how much do you sleep?

24
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,560
Maybe now that I'm,
I'm doing all this crazy stuff.

25
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:10,550
Uh,
three hours.

26
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:11,413
Three.
It was a lot.

27
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,670
Wow.
What do you normally sleep if you

28
00:01:13,671 --> 00:01:14,990
weren't doing that?
If I'm lucky.

29
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:16,340
Wow.
Four hours.

30
00:01:16,341 --> 00:01:18,130
Maybe we'll you're juiced up on nicotine
dollars,

31
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:18,531
Huh?
No,

32
00:01:18,531 --> 00:01:20,750
it has to do with,
I have to worry of the editing.

33
00:01:20,751 --> 00:01:21,381
Like,
you know,

34
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:24,080
like I have to do the notes at night so
that they can edit during the day.

35
00:01:24,081 --> 00:01:27,020
And then I go in at night and then now
like with all these,

36
00:01:27,021 --> 00:01:29,420
like with radio as you know,
like radio and all that stuff,

37
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,640
it's like this is a weird schedule.
It's all of that.

38
00:01:31,641 --> 00:01:34,070
And then doing shows at night,
because I never stopped doing shows.

39
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,260
Right,
of course.

40
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:37,090
But I meant like,
when you're not doing this and you said

41
00:01:37,091 --> 00:01:39,310
five hours,
five hours maybe.

42
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,410
Is that because you're all juiced up
with nicotine all the time?

43
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:44,080
I think cause I'm old and my prostate
tells me it's time to get up.

44
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,540
I take a leak five hours and you're
good.

45
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,100
Um,
if I'm lucky,

46
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:50,440
you know,
get some palm palm juice.

47
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,160
Have you tried some of those pills that
help?

48
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,400
What is this doctor?
Oz Guinness.

49
00:01:54,401 --> 00:01:55,234
It's shit.

50
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:01,520
It's like we were just watching heavy
metal and there's like a Caribou carcass

51
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:02,061
here.
It's like,

52
00:02:02,061 --> 00:02:05,420
have you ever thought of like who gives
a shit?

53
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:08,180
It's part of getting old guys.
Get used to it.

54
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:10,400
Get used to it.
Joe,

55
00:02:10,401 --> 00:02:14,120
you're old enough to start now and not
have any probably any problems from

56
00:02:14,121 --> 00:02:16,040
smoking.
You'll tried out for a year.

57
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:21,090
You would never saw anybody who was an
athlete in their youth or like stole is

58
00:02:21,471 --> 00:02:24,250
involved in athletics?
Like smoking is a no,

59
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,880
my cardio was very important to me.
Yeah.

60
00:02:25,881 --> 00:02:26,990
Yeah,
I understand that.

61
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:28,550
You know,
never fuck around with that,

62
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,770
but I'd get it.
I do love like,

63
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,191
uh,
you know,

64
00:02:31,191 --> 00:02:33,950
smokers do like,
I'm just talking about like my dad and

65
00:02:33,951 --> 00:02:36,230
his friends,
like they would have amazing like

66
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,020
smokers superpowers where it's like,
no,

67
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,660
they couldn't do anything.
But like if there was like something

68
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:42,320

you know,

69
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,490
hey,
I need your help.

70
00:02:43,491 --> 00:02:46,310
What happened?
My car fell in a ditch and like they

71
00:02:46,311 --> 00:02:48,670
would just come out with a cigarette in
the mouth and like lift up the,

72
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,910

Yes.

81

Fat that permeates all the different
layers of his skin and cause he,

82
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:22,090
she's not a muscle left under that and

84
00:03:25,921 --> 00:03:27,640

tampon.

89
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:46,030
society.
Oh bless his soul.

90
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:49,150
God bless her.
She died of a heart attack at 51 she

91
00:03:49,151 --> 00:03:52,630
weighed 300 pounds.
He's the guy driving that truck,

92
00:03:52,631 --> 00:03:53,130
that beep dot.

93
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:58,120
Mcgary fucking God.
I got my fucking peppers.

94
00:03:58,121 --> 00:04:03,121
She had got my meatballs.
I know when I walk my the fat on my feet

95
00:04:03,581 --> 00:04:06,360
spills over the outside of my sneakers.
I like that.

96
00:04:06,361 --> 00:04:09,130
That looks like a little waterfalls.
Dig into my heel.

97
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:14,080
Who I stepped down just
rolls over.

98
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:17,110
I like,
I liked the waddle cause my fucking

99
00:04:17,111 --> 00:04:19,060
guns,
my gun sticking out.

100
00:04:19,061 --> 00:04:21,910
My legs can't stay.
So the way the back of my head looks to

101
00:04:21,911 --> 00:04:23,770
dog the hot dog roll.
Look,

102
00:04:23,771 --> 00:04:27,820
I look fat sausages that are grown out
of the base of my skull.

103
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,830
It looks like a mix.
You're hungry for the fucking,

104
00:04:30,831 --> 00:04:35,831
the either the fucking nice to so source
each show my face.

105
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:42,190
You see a wrinkle in my face.
You see any spider marks by my eyes?

106
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:45,580
Fuck no,
because the flesh is pushing out against

107
00:04:45,581 --> 00:04:46,690
the skin all the time.

108
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,900
It's pulled tight.
It makes me look young and vibrant.

109
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:53,200
Look at my Chin's tight.
All of them died.

110
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,580
Tell him,
tell him the story about how,

111
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:59,110
how you wrote your training with our
lasky after training where he's,

112
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:00,123
he goes,
come here.

113
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:00,911
Yeah.
Yeah.

114
00:05:00,911 --> 00:05:01,810
So,
uh,

115
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,300
Andre Arlovski and I used to train
together,

116
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:06,130
uh,
Jackson's camp and I was getting ready

117
00:05:06,131 --> 00:05:08,650
for a fight this over shoot almost four
years ago.

118
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:12,340
The two fighters that I,
when I first got into the game that I

119
00:05:12,341 --> 00:05:17,341
admired and loved where Mirko Cro,
cop and Andrea are Laski by two very

120
00:05:17,501 --> 00:05:18,910
favorites.
That's who I wanted to be like.

121
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:22,870
So I walked in the gym and it was our
lost keys first day at Jackson's too.

122
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:24,520
And uh,
you know,

123
00:05:24,521 --> 00:05:26,650
when you seen a guy in TV fighting all
the time,

124
00:05:26,651 --> 00:05:27,940
then you run into me like,
damn,

125
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:29,320
all right.
So I see him like,

126
00:05:29,321 --> 00:05:30,560
Oh shit,
this under lawsky.

127
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:33,110
So then like I shop her last year in the
ring,

128
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:34,600
first day spine,
right,

129
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,430
fresh off the plane and we're sparring
with them.

130
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,730
So me and him are gone and it's,
it's a close round.

131
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,690
He's a Badass,
right?

132
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,320
I'm are going back and forth.
People would literally stop and watch a

133
00:05:43,321 --> 00:05:46,120
spar were just these dog rounds back and
forth,

134
00:05:46,121 --> 00:05:50,860
five rounds in a row.
Then later that night we grapple and

135
00:05:50,861 --> 00:05:53,740
then the next morning I drink coffee
every morning.

136
00:05:53,741 --> 00:05:54,880
Right.
Or drinking coffee,

137
00:05:54,881 --> 00:05:58,500
not this horrible coffee breath,
breath smell like pure coffee,

138
00:05:58,501 --> 00:05:59,334
shit breath.
Right.

139
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,830
And I'd go up to Andre and he's,
he's not very warm person at all.

140
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:04,880
Nope,
not at all.

141
00:06:04,881 --> 00:06:07,790
Is that very Belarus rush in where it's
going to take a while to be his friend?

142
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:09,920
I can tell and I'm trying to break these
barriers,

143
00:06:09,921 --> 00:06:10,754
man.
I don't know.

144
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:12,980
Hey Brah just wanna let you know,
man.

145
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,970
I got the coffee breath and he,
uh,

146
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:17,060
he didn't say a word to me the night
before training goes,

147
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:19,160
it's okay.
It's okay.

148
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,350
Much better than yesterday.
Yesterday.

149
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,940
Shit.
I go,

150
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,830
what?
He goes yesterday,

151
00:06:24,831 --> 00:06:28,550
breast smelled like Shit.
Oh cool man.

152
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,230
Cool.
And then just went about our business.

153
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,270
That was really the only words he ever
said to me,

154
00:06:32,271 --> 00:06:34,150
man.
We trained together for a while.

155
00:06:34,151 --> 00:06:36,470
It wasn't even like from,
what about when you were kicking,

156
00:06:36,471 --> 00:06:38,510
when you had your kick his body?
Yeah.

157
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:40,970
And then we'll get done a train.
I've never done this.

158
00:06:40,971 --> 00:06:41,850
He goes,
ah,

159
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:43,840
I'm trying to do my best Russian accent
it,

160
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:45,830
you guys are pretty much terrible.
That's horrible.

161
00:06:45,831 --> 00:06:46,430
Right?
Okay.

162
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,420
Sorry,
I'm not from Russia.

163
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,640
He goes up,
he goes,

164
00:06:49,641 --> 00:06:51,390
put your hands on top of your head like
this.

165
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,221
And I'm like,
what are we doing?

166
00:06:52,221 --> 00:06:53,900
And we just got done sparring.
I'm exhausted,

167
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,000
right?
I put my hands up and he just goes,

168
00:06:56,001 --> 00:06:59,000
braced herself and starts wailing at my
body.

169
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:02,750
Why?
With kicks punches Waylon is this,

170
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:05,060
this make you tough?
My okay.

171
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:06,380
And I'm like,
oh,

172
00:07:06,381 --> 00:07:08,300
I'll try to be tough though.
Cause he's my hair all like,

173
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,100
oh,
okay.

174
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,030
Oh Wow.
And then he goes,

175
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:12,500
my turn,
you do it to me.

176
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,541
And I'm like,
dude,

177
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:14,001
he goes,
no,

178
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:17,480
you hit like girl hit.
And I'm fucking trying,

179
00:07:17,481 --> 00:07:18,770
man.
Trying to hurt this guy.

180
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,620
Nothing.
And that was my experience with Andre

181
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,453
Arlovski.

182
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:31,790
Okay.
