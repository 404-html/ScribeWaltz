six months.

9
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:09,260
Then the heavyweight division needs him.

10
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:10,680
Fuck yeah.

11
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:11,700

00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:15,450
Bah Bah Bah Bah.

15
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:16,260
You're welcome.

BOMP bomp bomp bomp bomp yeah.

17
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:19,500
Imagine that fight.

18
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:21,900
The only problem is if you think so,

19
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:22,853
yes.

20
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,240
Mark them in the grappling.

21
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:25,840
I think you're just completely died.

22
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,820
Can fucking steel pig
would fucking pissed.

23
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:35,790
Pissed that go and he'll fuck
Brock Lesnar cause they'll say it.

24
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,610
You better do the fuck
steroids you pick is crazy.

25
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:40,030
I mean I love that motherfucker.

26
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:40,680
Yo Chick.

27
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,400
I love him.

28
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,990
I love them to immigrant mentality.

29
00:00:42,991 --> 00:00:43,824
Bring them on.

30
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,650
Give him more fucking steroids.

31
00:00:46,651 --> 00:00:47,070
What's that?

32
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,420
You want another America

33
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,810
definitely born and raised in Cleveland,

34
00:00:51,811 --> 00:00:52,201
Ohio.

35
00:00:52,201 --> 00:00:55,830
But when it's got that fucking crazy blood
in them and he don't give a fuck bro,

36
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:56,710
he proved the listening.

37
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:57,361
He proved it.

38
00:00:57,361 --> 00:00:58,980
Went with fucking Overeem.

39
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:00,420
You don't give a fuck.

40
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:04,750
Put Him in there with the product at all.

41
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,260
That the waste to the guilt.

42
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,260
Fucking Brocklin who just rag doll pull
Mark Paul poured more Mark Hunt fucking

43
00:01:12,261 --> 00:01:12,471
gay.

44
00:01:12,471 --> 00:01:14,590
But mark has never been the
kind of grappling and steep is.

45
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,071
Oh No.

46
00:01:17,071 --> 00:01:17,960
I think Steve Bay beach.

47
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:18,770
You know what?

48
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:20,130
If he punched a steep in the face,

49
00:01:20,131 --> 00:01:22,020
it's going to get more steam
out of his fucking he is.

50
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:22,883
And you saw

51
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:28,080
last night coming back back last name
that because he's not going to come back

52
00:01:28,081 --> 00:01:29,640
and fight for a world title right away.

53
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:30,873
You don't think so?

54
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:33,640
I think it's the biggest embarrassed,

55
00:01:33,641 --> 00:01:34,200
clear the fog.

56
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,220
That would be a crazy for the biggest
fucking embarrassment of the year.

57
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,670
Why would that be embarrassment?

58
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:39,540
It's embarrassing.

59
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,430
It's just embarrassing it
because it's Mark Hunt.

60
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,080
They knew he was on the juice.

61
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,030
He went in there loaded to the gills.

62
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,250
It was just an imbalance.

63
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,380
It was an embarrassing
thing for everybody.

64
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,690
And Mark Hunt that every
fucking right to be mad.

65
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:55,320
They put them in there with a guy
that's coming off rocket fucking fuel.

66
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:55,831
That dude,

67
00:01:55,831 --> 00:01:57,240
don't just throw the deep ball.

68
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:58,710
What is the size of his fucking head?

69
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:01,260
He's taking shit that makes
you a fucking head grow

70
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:03,890
a fucking pit.

71
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:04,470
Bulls.

72
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:05,890
I hope they put them against my yoke.

73
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:06,270
Chick.

74
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,050
I will fly to fucking clean back gum.

75
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,730
It's climate con climbing a mountain.

76
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,540
I found the snot in my nose.

77
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:13,440
It was bigger than this gum.

78
00:02:13,441 --> 00:02:13,700
The Ed.

79
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,360
They had to take the gum
out to eat it anyway.

80
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:18,960
Oh was so long.

81
00:02:18,961 --> 00:02:19,800
It was like a cookbook book.

82
00:02:19,801 --> 00:02:23,160
I got a flashback from the
hell that motherfucker.

83
00:02:23,161 --> 00:02:23,580
Anyway.

84
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,540
Oh booger.

85
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,393
Cause I love him.

86
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:26,971
I love him.

87
00:02:26,971 --> 00:02:31,971
From time to time I have a little pimple
squeeze it and it just comes out and

88
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:37,550
it's got like a little clam board
with you with all this Steve Shit.

89
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:39,600
From time to time.

90
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,200
Oh,

91
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:40,651
when you eat,

92
00:02:40,651 --> 00:02:41,910
when you can quote for 30 years.

93
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:42,451
It's a habit.

94
00:02:42,451 --> 00:02:43,261
You wake up in the morning,

95
00:02:43,261 --> 00:02:44,094
pick one out.

96
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,190
It's like a candy cane with coke.

97
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,220
You inhale that motherfucker.

98
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,650
It's like going to the dentist for free.

99
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,020
I will throw up on this fucking table.

100
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:53,653
Do you ever do

101
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:55,750
that?

102
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,240
To be honest with ourselves,

103
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:58,470
we're all friends here.

104
00:02:58,471 --> 00:03:00,760
That was the most fucking
thing I ever seen.

105
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:01,360
I agree.

106
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,420
They knew he was on it and they
put that fucking animal in there.

107
00:03:04,421 --> 00:03:05,110
Okay.

108
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:05,801
And you know what,

109
00:03:05,801 --> 00:03:06,520
man?

110
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,120
Go ahead.

111
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,290
Keep doing those steroids.

112
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:08,911
Put them in there again,

113
00:03:08,911 --> 00:03:09,280
spiel,

114
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,113
but whatever.

115
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,820
I love that Cleveland motherfucker.

116
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:13,743
Dude,

117
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:14,530
kill him.

118
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:15,580
He'll fucking kill him.

119
00:03:15,581 --> 00:03:16,470
And General Stevia,

120
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,280
they would ever be able to have him
come off a suspension and fight for the

121
00:03:21,281 --> 00:03:21,670
title.

122
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:22,840
That's not how it goes.

123
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:23,510
Ah,

124
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:26,200
they've done billion dollars though.

125
00:03:26,201 --> 00:03:28,180
Even a scab off and
Iranians head right now.

126
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,211
Right now,

127
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,340
they're fucking sitting there going,

128
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,071
we lost Ron.

129
00:03:33,071 --> 00:03:34,200
Take the gum out of your mouth.

130
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,350
Dry Pavement.

131
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,770
They lost Rhonda.

132
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:39,910
And the only other thing,

133
00:03:39,911 --> 00:03:41,980
we got his fucking cotton
and he's having a baby.

134
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:43,330
He don't want to fucking come back.

135
00:03:43,331 --> 00:03:43,451
Now.

136
00:03:43,451 --> 00:03:45,220
You know what he's talking about.

137
00:03:45,221 --> 00:03:46,520
He might come back there,

138
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:48,700
but they don't want to give
him who he supposed to fight.

139
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,950
Who is he supposed to be supposed
to fight that fucking collar?

140
00:03:50,951 --> 00:03:54,000
Beep and end of story.

141
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,210
No more fucking around that one.

142
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,083
Then let's do it.

143
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:59,020
Let's set it up.

144
00:03:59,020 --> 00:03:59,531
No,

145
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:00,364
that's not

146
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:02,723
my job

147
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,780
to find out though.

148
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:06,280
You don't need to fight nobody.

149
00:04:06,281 --> 00:04:07,091
He's number one,

150
00:04:07,091 --> 00:04:07,480
right?

151
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,550
Or is it was your boy number
one Tony Khabib's number one.

152
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:15,900
Then that's the fight enough and he was
number one and then Khabib Kim became

153
00:04:16,661 --> 00:04:17,231
number one.

154
00:04:17,231 --> 00:04:19,210
Why did could be a leapfrog Tony?

155
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:19,961
I don't know.

156
00:04:19,961 --> 00:04:24,230
Who knows the ranking cause he talked
goes to only fought a couple of times and

157
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,220
I don't know if he's the one is he is my
number one brother could leaves number

158
00:04:27,221 --> 00:04:27,401
one.

159
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:28,540
Well that's the thing you did.

160
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:28,811
Listen,

161
00:04:28,811 --> 00:04:29,650
he's fighting now.

162
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,000
He's available today.

163
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,380
He's available today.

164
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,670
He's available for Brooklyn.

165
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,370
He said it when he fought
against Michael Johnson.

166
00:04:36,371 --> 00:04:37,720
He's available for fucking Brooklyn.

167
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:38,861
Okay.

168
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:40,540
He's available for Brooklyn entry.

169
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,490
Let's get Eddie against Raphael.

170
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,540
That's a good fight.

171
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:46,200
Let's get that sent back in that
people like watching him live.

172
00:04:46,201 --> 00:04:46,540
Very.

173
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,373
Let's get,

174
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:49,751
let's get,

175
00:04:49,751 --> 00:04:51,160
we got some fucking people here.

176
00:04:51,161 --> 00:04:51,420
Okay.

177
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,253
A lot of good guy.

178
00:04:56,030 --> 00:05:00,470
He sells paper views now
it's around 300,000 but he's,

179
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:05,490
he's always Robbie Lawler that
got as good fucking they got.

180
00:05:06,761 --> 00:05:08,410
Joey needs to be the matchmaker.

181
00:05:08,411 --> 00:05:09,191
Fucking got it.

182
00:05:09,191 --> 00:05:09,580
Okay.

183
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,413
Well No.

184
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:11,501
Yeah man.

185
00:05:11,501 --> 00:05:12,840
It's an interesting situation.

186
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:14,410
Got Plenty of good fucking fight.

187
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:16,600
I want to give us the fights.

188
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:18,150
Whitewater seat.

189
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,780
No problem.

190
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:25,060
That's the beep and the story.

191
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:26,320
There's no outdoor,

192
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:27,910
no Tony Ferguson.

193
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,230
There's no babies.

194
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,041
There's no nothing,

195
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:30,980
but he has a poor boy.

196
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,313
He's got a baby.

197
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:38,710
It's not a big draw for me
to fuck 20 million on you.

198
00:05:38,711 --> 00:05:40,180
The baby's weight six weeks,

199
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:41,680
but kindness already got 20 million.

200
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:42,543
That's the difference.

201
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,050
He wants to take time,

202
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,330
not breadth of his,

203
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:45,601
his,

204
00:05:45,601 --> 00:05:48,360
his life is more important
than what the UFC was,

205
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,530
was running the show.

206
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:50,201
I agree with you,

207
00:05:50,201 --> 00:05:53,290
but right now then May 5th may
labor on Memorial Day weekend.

208
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,633
It's called [inaudible].

209
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:55,390
I beat,

210
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,260
I beat Ferguson,

211
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:57,543
Ferguson,

212
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:58,940
Ferguson,

213
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,110
Sharon.

214
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:00,980
Let's have some fun.

215
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,330
You're Ferguson so wrong.

216
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,360
Let's have some fucking button.

217
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:07,160
It's a fire siren is
not fighting 55 again.

218
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:07,911
I didn't say that,

219
00:06:07,911 --> 00:06:09,140
but we're all mixing.

220
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,910
We're all mixing weights right now.

221
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,140
Did we not say that before?

222
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,130
They want to put out,

223
00:06:13,131 --> 00:06:13,581
go against.

224
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:13,851
Could be,

225
00:06:13,851 --> 00:06:14,330
but no.

226
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:15,530
All those thinking about moving up.

227
00:06:15,531 --> 00:06:16,430
Any moving up anyway,

228
00:06:16,431 --> 00:06:17,390
so who gives a fuck?

229
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,560
It seems like he's Kinda
of it like a chess move.

230
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,190
Like Jason said,

231
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:21,951
Connor fee.

232
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,850
Once that fight,

233
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,890
that's what everybody
wants to see you again,

234
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,450
whatever the fucking orders,

235
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:30,260
but the order that they're trying to put
together is the order that I don't want

236
00:06:30,261 --> 00:06:31,940
to see because they have to sell paper,

237
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,290
but they're going to do this.

238
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:34,100
Okay.

239
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,470
This is the route you flux.

240
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:38,940
He's telling us they're going to,

241
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,850
they're going to bring him back against
fucking the black dude at one 70 that's

242
00:06:43,851 --> 00:06:44,181
the fight.

243
00:06:44,181 --> 00:06:44,990
Tyron Woodley.

244
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:48,710
That's already been made at the thing
that when it comes to get slow the fuck

245
00:06:48,711 --> 00:06:49,061
down.

246
00:06:49,061 --> 00:06:49,520
Watch it,

247
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,200
watch it,

248
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,290
but we just said that Woodley's
going to fight Bisbing and catch I.

249
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:54,051
I know,

250
00:06:54,051 --> 00:06:54,261
I know.

251
00:06:54,261 --> 00:06:54,921
That's what great.

252
00:06:54,921 --> 00:06:55,760
They're gonna fight one.

253
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:59,240
You think that Tyron Woodley is going
to fight her own willy that was already

254
00:06:59,241 --> 00:07:00,440
established in New York.

255
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:01,221
Tyrone Woodley,

256
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:02,054
Tyron,

257
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,130
Tyron Woodley is already
going to fucking fight.

258
00:07:04,131 --> 00:07:04,964
I'm okay.

259
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,020
That's the first fight.

260
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:07,400
Then they're going to try that.

261
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,271
That's the fight.

262
00:07:08,271 --> 00:07:10,370
They're going to put
that one 70 maybe in May.

263
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:10,791
What happens?

264
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:11,560
It could be then,

265
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:11,691
then.

266
00:07:11,691 --> 00:07:13,780
Then this is what this is.

267
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:16,790
This is my decision.

268
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:17,570
This is beyond you.

269
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:21,540
This is beyond I this and I haven't
really seen the setup at the fucking New

270
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:24,710
York for you fucking blind because you
didn't see what I see and talk to them.

271
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:25,580
I know you talked to them,

272
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:29,790
but then I'll tell you the deck that I'm
talking to them so you didn't know who

273
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:30,981
I did.

274
00:07:30,981 --> 00:07:31,790
I loved the ad.

275
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:32,570
Understand,

276
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:34,880
but the problem is here that that was,

277
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:37,670
the seed was already planted in New York.

278
00:07:37,671 --> 00:07:38,660
It was already planted.

279
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:40,010
None of you motherfuckers saw it.

280
00:07:40,011 --> 00:07:40,771
What do you guys watch?

281
00:07:40,771 --> 00:07:41,440
What seed?

282
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,150
The seed of him talking
back and forth with Tyrone.

283
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:45,800
Tyron Woodley.

284
00:07:45,801 --> 00:07:46,131
Okay.

285
00:07:46,131 --> 00:07:47,210
That's the fucking feet.

286
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:48,283
Jesus Christ.

287
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:49,240
The fucking seat.

288
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,360
Smells like a zoo.

289
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,233
He's going to look up.

290
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,700
He's going to look at these.

291
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,810
You already at the press conference.

292
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:58,310
He could be.

293
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,143
He said,

294
00:07:59,350 --> 00:07:59,631
oh,

295
00:07:59,631 --> 00:08:01,050
he doesn't fight enough and get,

296
00:08:01,051 --> 00:08:01,250
wait,

297
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:01,980
what's going on here?

298
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,910
That's Wayne's talking shit.

299
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,820
That's the seed.

300
00:08:04,821 --> 00:08:05,780
You're dumb fucks.

301
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,490
That's what's happening here.

302
00:08:07,491 --> 00:08:08,324
What is he saying?

303
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:09,163
He's just talking shit.

304
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:10,850
You hear what he said?

305
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,780
I don't think so.

306
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:14,550
It went on and then timeline said,

307
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,513
somebody said,

308
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,393
hey,

309
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:18,043
come out.

310
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,060
Like you're lucky I
don't come to seven days.

311
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:22,323
We can do it.

312
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,160
Look at him trying to be cute
with them for a moment here.

313
00:08:25,161 --> 00:08:26,090
There's a moment saying,

314
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:27,390
hey bro,

315
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:31,220
going between Tyron Woodley
and it got set up right there.

316
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:32,010
Okay,

317
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,840
so that's the next fucking fight,

318
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:39,030
Conor saying we can do it at 70
we can tell you that Joey's Dick,

319
00:08:39,201 --> 00:08:41,300
because you see what
you want to fucking see.

320
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,500
That's the next fight.

321
00:08:42,501 --> 00:08:42,921
They already,

322
00:08:42,921 --> 00:08:44,570
he already planted the fucking feet.

323
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,850
He's not going to fight Tyrone.

324
00:08:45,851 --> 00:08:49,820
He's going to fight Tyron and
killed one time for canopy.

325
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:52,410
Like they threw Dennis
deeper with Frankie.

326
00:08:52,411 --> 00:08:53,670
Edgar was fucking working

327
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:56,803
through Dennis.

328
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,570
That is safe as available.

329
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:04,710
You know the color of
his skin so already gets,

330
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:06,810
he's talking some truth.

331
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,670
It's in between fucking he's,

332
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,350
he doesn't want to fight Ferguson.

333
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,640
He's dropping a fight.

334
00:09:11,641 --> 00:09:12,401
Tony Ferguson.

335
00:09:12,401 --> 00:09:14,010
Why not just bro,

336
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:17,310
it's too much height and Tony
Ferguson don't give a fuck.

337
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:19,170
He's a bugbear backstage again,

338
00:09:19,171 --> 00:09:20,010
fucking Florida.

339
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,570
That is a horrible for me,

340
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,030
it's tremendous.

341
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:24,690
It's tremendous.

342
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:25,800
It's like a zoo.

343
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:26,600
Oh,

344
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,010
look at this.

345
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:27,660
They're gone.

346
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,493
Fuck with.

347
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:29,970
Get some volume on that.

348
00:09:29,971 --> 00:09:31,950
Can we get volume on that back there?

349
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:32,180
Oh,

350
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,200
here this go all the way back.

351
00:09:34,201 --> 00:09:35,034
Way Back.

352
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,213
There we go.

353
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,020
Crank it up.

354
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:37,853
He's setting it up.

355
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,440
She's setting up the one shot.

356
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,750
There's eight guys,

357
00:09:48,751 --> 00:09:49,584
big guys

358
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,030
with that phone.

359
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:52,960
Whoa.

360
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,793
It's crazy.

361
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:55,663
There's 10 guys.

362
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:56,800
Look out.

363
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,970
Drain Tyron looks.

364
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,570
Let's hit rewind it again.

365
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,950
We went in the Sh sh

366
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,170
nothing much.

367
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,010
You're that lady to,

368
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:11,751
you said what's up?

369
00:10:11,751 --> 00:10:12,471
And he started crying.

370
00:10:12,471 --> 00:10:12,711
I said,

371
00:10:12,711 --> 00:10:13,091
what's up?

372
00:10:13,091 --> 00:10:13,311
He said,

373
00:10:13,311 --> 00:10:13,910
not much,

374
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,140
but meanwhile you look at Tyron.

375
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:17,060
Tyron looks so drained there.

376
00:10:17,061 --> 00:10:20,000
When he made that weight is
like right after he made the way

377
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:24,620
he's going to go for
three fucking cops goes,

378
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:26,570
nobody ever saw this shit.

379
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,371
He doesn't know what.

380
00:10:27,371 --> 00:10:30,080
He's not going to fight
Ferguson because it's a fucking,

381
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:31,810
it's arrow.

382
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:36,840
Smith guns and roses was Aerosmith on
steroids and Tony Ferguson is little Diaz

383
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,040
with fucking

384
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:42,523
blood in them.

385
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,341
You understand me?

386
00:10:43,341 --> 00:10:44,174
He didn't want that.

387
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:47,460
You know,

388
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,880
I'm Tony Ferguson and Dana.

389
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,290
It's not a draw paint and junk.

390
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:51,411
Well,

391
00:10:51,411 --> 00:10:51,771
John,

392
00:10:51,771 --> 00:10:56,771
Uncle Bobby Dana is not going to let
his nephew fight collar be kidding.

393
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,240
Connor versus Tony is not a draw.

394
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:00,770
It's not a draw for Conner.

395
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:01,670
I know.

396
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:02,360
He's your guy.

397
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,770
That's a big fucking fight.

398
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:05,930
Make a total big fucking side though.

399
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:10,790
Why do you think they're making it?

400
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:11,624
Eddie?

401
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:13,250
You tell me.

402
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,400
Why do you think they make us?

403
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,670
It's not going to self
and I love these guys.

404
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,031
Don't get me,

405
00:11:17,031 --> 00:11:17,560
I'm not,

406
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,040
I'm not clowning your guy.

407
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,960
But as far as the average
consumer buying a paper view,

408
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:23,060
that's not a cell.

409
00:11:23,061 --> 00:11:24,080
It's just not hell.

410
00:11:24,081 --> 00:11:24,331
Yeah,

411
00:11:24,331 --> 00:11:24,651
it is.

412
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:25,570
I just kind of fighting,

413
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:31,340
fighting a top challenger
is always a sale and Tony,

414
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,550
but Tony Ferguson is most
certainly a top challenger.

415
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:37,370
When Nate Diaz fought
Conor for the first time,

416
00:11:37,371 --> 00:11:41,720
it was a giant fight because Nate
Diaz had a name and he's a bit,

417
00:11:41,721 --> 00:11:42,950
he's a bigger name than Tony,

418
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,270
arguably for sure.

419
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:45,170
Not even close,

420
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:48,430
much bigger now after
he beat them for others.

421
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,800
And Tony wasn't the same as it is now.

422
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:51,843
It's a different,

423
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,200
it's a different thing now,

424
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:53,480
but,

425
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:58,480
but he had it because of nick and nick
had had all the strike force success,

426
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:01,180
elite Eggsy success,

427
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,430
you know all that is a lot of TV time.

428
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:04,750
There's the ultimate fighter winner,

429
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:05,770
Nate.

430
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:06,940
And then on top of that,

431
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:11,110
nick had just got done beaten
Anderson or fighting Anderson Rather.

432
00:12:11,111 --> 00:12:11,944
And you know nick,

433
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,380
nick is like a pretty well known figure,

434
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:14,660
right?

435
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:15,460
His brother,

436
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,750
they're both the Diaz brothers are like,

437
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,370
so that's a different level.

438
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:22,030
But having them take that
fight on short notice too.

439
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,910
But Connor was the main draws my point

440
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,420
because I agree,

441
00:12:28,421 --> 00:12:28,630
it's,

442
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:29,610
he's the main draw.

443
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:32,080
If you're calm and you're his manager,

444
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:33,250
he'd go and let's fight Tony,

445
00:12:33,251 --> 00:12:34,750
who's a tough fucking matchup,

446
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,250
but he's not as big as the name is.

447
00:12:36,251 --> 00:12:40,420
A guy like Nate Diaz at 55 who
we're going to make more money,

448
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:42,910
maybe not as tough as a fight bigger name.

449
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:46,390
So they're doing it from the
business point and not fighting,

450
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,793
not fighting can be.

451
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,930
You also have the fight
in horrible fight for,

452
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:53,470
they're going to do a Russia card and
when they do a Russia card they want to do

453
00:12:53,471 --> 00:12:55,750
a rush card with Connor
or with hubby brother.

454
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:57,420
So when they do a rush,

455
00:12:57,421 --> 00:12:58,254
a car with a beam,

456
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:01,840
it's most likely going to be for a
title I would imagine like so a title.

457
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:02,831
It all depends.

458
00:13:02,831 --> 00:13:03,650
If common accepts,

459
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:08,470
that reminder might be Tony and in my
parents room and apparently they offered

460
00:13:08,471 --> 00:13:11,260
it to Tony and Tony said that he wanted
to make the same amount of money that

461
00:13:11,261 --> 00:13:11,940
Habib Manx.

462
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,250
It's just perfectly fun at first,

463
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,070
but you know they said,

464
00:13:15,071 --> 00:13:15,550
nope,

465
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:16,450
you got a contract,

466
00:13:16,451 --> 00:13:17,440
you got to honor your contract.

467
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,900
That's at least how it's been explained.

468
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:20,681
Yes.

469
00:13:20,681 --> 00:13:21,580
That's how it's been explained.

470
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:21,761
They go,

471
00:13:21,761 --> 00:13:21,931
nope,

472
00:13:21,931 --> 00:13:23,110
well you sign these contracts,

473
00:13:23,111 --> 00:13:24,610
you got to honor the contract.

474
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,420
Yeah,

475
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:25,901
but that,

476
00:13:25,901 --> 00:13:26,120
that,

477
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,250
that only works one way.

478
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:30,250
The only works for the UFC because
they don't honor all the contracts.

479
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:30,830
They,

480
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:32,500
what do you mean for works
for they can cut them.

481
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:33,040
They can.

482
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,040
You have a six week contracts
and you've lost two,

483
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:36,400
but that seems contrary to cut.

484
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:39,550
It's in the contract that you can
get cut if it wasn't in the contract.

485
00:13:39,551 --> 00:13:42,880
There's guys who have fought and they
fought out their entire contract for sure.

486
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:43,130
Right.

487
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:43,601
But I'm just saying,

488
00:13:43,601 --> 00:13:43,871
hey Joe,

489
00:13:43,871 --> 00:13:44,430
here's the ones,

490
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:47,950
I remember the early days and Pedro Huizar
had this giant contract because they

491
00:13:47,951 --> 00:13:49,720
thought the page was going
to be the heavyweight champ.

492
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,670
And so they were giving
him like undercard fights.

493
00:13:51,671 --> 00:13:53,140
He's making quarter of $1 million.

494
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:54,280
Yeah,

495
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:54,940
yeah.

496
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:55,751
It's tricky man.

497
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:56,810
Because I get the,

498
00:13:56,811 --> 00:13:59,710
the idea that they would
want to protect Konner um,

499
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,041
you know,

500
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:00,241
and,

501
00:14:00,241 --> 00:14:02,200
and really set up the big money fights,

502
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:04,000
especially now because
he's the biggest guy.

503
00:14:04,001 --> 00:14:07,510
But then you've got Connor who's
kind of fucking crazy and he's like,

504
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:07,720
well,

505
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,730
the way he is John down
tire and literally he gets,

506
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:11,451
or Dune,

507
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:12,190
I think it from,

508
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:13,550
from a business standpoint,

509
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:13,940
they're going,

510
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:14,350
wow,

511
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,510
what's the biggest fight pot?

512
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:16,780
Let's say you have three fights left.

513
00:14:16,781 --> 00:14:20,260
Who are the three biggest names we
can fight and to make this happen.

514
00:14:20,261 --> 00:14:22,210
So you stay on to feel big
and make the most money.

515
00:14:22,211 --> 00:14:23,150
He might not be under feet.

516
00:14:23,151 --> 00:14:24,520
I mean he's definitely not undefeated now.

517
00:14:24,521 --> 00:14:25,000
Right,

518
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,990
but the biggest thing is the Woodley
fight because that's a one seven.one seven

519
00:14:28,991 --> 00:14:30,100
that's a third belt guys.

520
00:14:30,101 --> 00:14:30,934
That's a fight.

521
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,793
As

522
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,540
much control on you motherfuckers up.

523
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:35,350
You didn't see it.

524
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:36,160
Number two,

525
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:36,700
listen,

526
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,160
I'm not saying if the
Khabib is going to be,

527
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,001
especially after,

528
00:14:40,001 --> 00:14:42,130
I actually don't talk to take
the punch from Michael Kahn.

529
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,230
I'm not saying Michael Michael Johnson,

530
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:47,650
but the fight is could beat and then
the next fight has to be Ferguson.

531
00:14:47,651 --> 00:14:48,484
If he beats him,

532
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:49,810
not just the way it is,

533
00:14:49,811 --> 00:14:51,030
which I Cook Ferguson,

534
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,160
we can't wait.

535
00:14:52,161 --> 00:14:55,610
They can't wait like fridges and needs
a fight like in the next four or five

536
00:14:55,611 --> 00:14:56,170
months.

537
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:57,920
It could be me as a fight
in the next fucking two,

538
00:14:57,921 --> 00:14:58,610
three months.

539
00:14:58,610 --> 00:14:58,880
I said,

540
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,713
don't fight in Brooklyn

541
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:02,383
from now.

542
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,360
When you went to view them.

543
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:05,840
Yeah,

544
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,240
he put the hat on your Mustang.

545
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,001
He said,

546
00:15:08,001 --> 00:15:08,750
you'll fight in Brooklyn.

547
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,430
Put her hat on my head every
time I put it every time.

548
00:15:10,431 --> 00:15:10,731
Right now.

549
00:15:10,731 --> 00:15:11,290
It's great.

550
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:15,440
I fucking love where that and you don't
say he looks at me and shows me the hat.

551
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:16,960
I give him the nod like yeah,

552
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:18,520
I put that hat on.

553
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:19,370
I like that hat.

554
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:22,370
Me As a fan,

555
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:24,940
I don't want to see is Tony Rush.

556
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:25,340
Gabby.

557
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,040
That's,

558
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:26,930
that's a fight.

559
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,250
There's not a better match up.

560
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,350
I can be made into movies.

561
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,230
I don't know about that.

562
00:15:30,231 --> 00:15:32,060
I like Tony versus Connor.

563
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,620
I even like a beat versus Connor.

564
00:15:33,621 --> 00:15:34,030
Yeah,

565
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:34,863
I like,

566
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:36,100
I like,

567
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,400
I like Connor versus Woodley.

568
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:39,160
I like that to fight to fight.

569
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:40,940
That's the next money fight.

570
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:42,620
But he's going to eventually,

571
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,630
I don't think the UFC gives
them enough power to do that.

572
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:46,650
I can get that.

573
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:48,950
Yeah.

574
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:49,783
He's got all the power.

575
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:53,690
Well here's the thing about
doing cowardly loses to Bisping.

576
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,280
If he loses those catch weight fight,

577
00:15:55,281 --> 00:15:57,350
he still keeps that 170 pounds strap.

578
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:59,200
That's if that catch that.

579
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,630
That's just he my,

580
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:01,671
no,

581
00:16:01,671 --> 00:16:03,170
he can't hold on to divisions.

582
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:06,020
I run against my board
cause I gotta go to,

583
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:06,650
right.

584
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:07,310
I'm telling you,

585
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:10,790
they were going after
Tyro planted the seed,

586
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:11,031
right.

587
00:16:11,031 --> 00:16:13,220
There are two divisions.

588
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,430
It's been backstage at u of C's.

589
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:14,941
All the guys.

590
00:16:14,941 --> 00:16:19,941
That's exactly what happened when I'm
away from the Russian as either as long as

591
00:16:21,261 --> 00:16:21,980
they can,

592
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,950
but specifically we can
talk over each other.

593
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:25,520
No,

594
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,980
they'll do the NASA thing when they
go to interview and they die in car

595
00:16:27,981 --> 00:16:28,850
accidents and shit,

596
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:30,590
but that's the fight guys.

597
00:16:30,591 --> 00:16:33,800
That's the fight right there that
everybody wants to see right off the bat.

598
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:37,430
I love to see Conor and could be
by love to see Ferguson and Khabib,

599
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,770
but they don't know to do
that right off the bat.

600
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:42,500
They're going to hope that they fall
off a cliff or a plane goes down.

601
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:43,920
Let's give him the money for it,

602
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:46,220
which is one 70 can get the third belt.

603
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,293
Here's the thing,

604
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:49,790
if he does lose,

605
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:52,290
if he goes up to [inaudible]
tire and nothing happened,

606
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,790
habits risk free,

607
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,191
it's free.

608
00:16:54,191 --> 00:16:54,560
It's free.

609
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,251
Same thing with that.

610
00:16:55,251 --> 00:16:55,730
Nate,

611
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:56,280
Nate Diaz,

612
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,860
phone number.

613
00:16:57,861 --> 00:16:58,694
Who runs this shit?

614
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,140
What'd you do?

615
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,060
What'd you do with Tony and Khabib?

616
00:17:02,061 --> 00:17:02,801
They go to Bella top.

617
00:17:02,801 --> 00:17:05,240
Hell no going to say,

618
00:17:05,241 --> 00:17:05,700
fuck you,

619
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,500
UFC,

620
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,730
we can't take this no more.

621
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:18,600
Okay.
