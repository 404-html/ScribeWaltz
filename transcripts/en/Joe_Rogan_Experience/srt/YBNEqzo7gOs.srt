1
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:03,630
Freak bitches.
Sure.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,070
I agree with you.
Can I switch gears?

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,000
Yeah.
I got to ask you about.

4
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,980
Ask me about anything.
Joey Diaz.

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,770
Tell me everything.
How did you meet Joe Ds?

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,660
Because I want you to ask me this.
I want you to ask me what my experience

7
00:00:15,661 --> 00:00:17,130
with joy,
but how did you meet him?

8
00:00:17,131 --> 00:00:18,270
How did he come into the fold?

9
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:21,690
I met Joey Diaz in the late nineties,
uh,

10
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,430
at the comedy store.
I think I met him in [inaudible] 96 or

11
00:00:24,431 --> 00:00:25,780
97,
something like that.

12
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,570
Uh,
right when Joey moved to La.

13
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:31,330
We just started hanging around the
comedy store when we became friends and

14
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:34,240
then I started taking on the road with
me like,

15
00:00:34,241 --> 00:00:35,740
uh,
the late nineties.

16
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,930
We've been best friends forever,

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,360
so I know of Joey.
I don't know Joey.

18
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:43,300
I've never met him.
Never met Joe.

19
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,830
Never.
I call him up right now.

20
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:46,790
TV and the whole bit.
And you know,

21
00:00:46,791 --> 00:00:49,230
I know him from,
from you and I see your podcasts and all

22
00:00:49,231 --> 00:00:49,670
that.
But.

23
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:51,580
And he's in the circles.
He does some Jujitsu.

24
00:00:51,581 --> 00:00:53,720
He's funnier than hell and he's a
gangster.

25
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:55,640
So I liked him,
but I don't know anything about him.

26
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:58,880
So he comes on my podcast now he has a
podcast.

27
00:00:58,881 --> 00:01:00,710
So of course my opening line to them is,
hey,

28
00:01:00,711 --> 00:01:01,670
how'd you get into pocket?
Right?

29
00:01:01,671 --> 00:01:04,280
I'm going to put here,
here's your plug for your podcast and

30
00:01:04,281 --> 00:01:05,780
we're going to go on and talk about my
agenda.

31
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:07,520
So I say,
Joe,

32
00:01:07,521 --> 00:01:09,260
I say to him,
Joey,

33
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:11,900
how'd you get into podcasting?
And his response,

34
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:14,750
you know Chael Sonnen,
he wouldn't call me jail.

35
00:01:14,751 --> 00:01:17,330
It was always.
She still calls me Joe Rogan.

36
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:22,250
I'm mugged a hooker down in New Jersey
and senator Lee set her wig on fire.

37
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:25,370
It's okay.
We got to.

38
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,110
There's two moving parts here.
First off,

39
00:01:27,111 --> 00:01:28,970
that is,
I don't know how that answers my

40
00:01:28,971 --> 00:01:32,420
question of how,
but now I need to know the story here.

41
00:01:32,421 --> 00:01:36,080
So we ties it all together with.
He went on something,

42
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:37,760
just something.
He got an appearance.

43
00:01:37,761 --> 00:01:40,460
He told the story,
a mug and a hooker in New Jersey and

44
00:01:40,461 --> 00:01:43,670
setting her wig on fire and all of a
sudden he blew up overnight and he goes,

45
00:01:43,671 --> 00:01:45,080
yeah.
I realized people like the stores,

46
00:01:45,081 --> 00:01:48,620
I never knew that I had stories from the
part of the country I'm in and the

47
00:01:48,621 --> 00:01:50,900
neighborhood I grew up in,
I thought everybody had these doors.

48
00:01:50,901 --> 00:01:51,531
He's like,
chill center,

49
00:01:51,531 --> 00:01:54,020
and I thought I'd tell you I mogul
hooker and lighter wig on fire.

50
00:01:54,021 --> 00:01:54,471
You Go,
yeah,

51
00:01:54,471 --> 00:01:56,900
well I'm a 10 hookers and let 10 wigs on
fire.

52
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:59,570
I was like,
I didn't know I had stories and then it

53
00:01:59,571 --> 00:02:02,800
just goes from there and he starts
telling me about sa Sa.

54
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:05,510
So he ends up doing two years or 18
months.

55
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:06,260
And I said,
well,

56
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,150
what kind of jam did you get in there?
And he said,

57
00:02:08,151 --> 00:02:09,260
well,
I was actually,

58
00:02:09,261 --> 00:02:10,820
I was doing the cop's job for them,
you know,

59
00:02:10,821 --> 00:02:12,260
the cops don't want drugs on the
streets.

60
00:02:12,261 --> 00:02:14,600
I went and took two kilos off the
streets for them.

61
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,360
This is how he presents it to me.
He goes,

62
00:02:17,361 --> 00:02:17,841
yeah,
you know,

63
00:02:17,841 --> 00:02:20,540
the,
the two kilos wasn't as big of a deal.

64
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,440
Oh.
He said,

65
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,041
Oh,
I,

66
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:23,720
I robbed two kilos.
He goes,

67
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,180
and you know what else?
Chael Sonnen.

68
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:28,600
I just happened to have a machine gun
and I go,

69
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,370
I can see where that happened because
she is sometimes you just back into a

70
00:02:31,371 --> 00:02:33,620
machine gun.
I had a machine gun with me and he goes,

71
00:02:33,621 --> 00:02:35,600
but it's funny.
I wasn't in trouble for the gun.

72
00:02:35,601 --> 00:02:38,090
I really wasn't in that much trouble for
the drugs.

73
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:40,160
What they were upset about was the
kidnapping.

74
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,211
I'm going,
okay,

75
00:02:41,211 --> 00:02:42,800
what?
What happened?

76
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,630
This is my intro to the guy.
I'm like,

77
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:46,310
what?
What in the hell is this story?

78
00:02:46,311 --> 00:02:47,780
You probably know the story,
but I did it.

79
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:49,940
So he tells me the whole story and he
says,

80
00:02:49,941 --> 00:02:50,451
yeah,
but you know,

81
00:02:50,451 --> 00:02:51,950
kidnappings,
kind of a weird charge.

82
00:02:51,951 --> 00:02:53,220
He goes,
when you invade Italy,

83
00:02:53,221 --> 00:02:54,680
gotten that scuffle in the ultimate
fighter.

84
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:58,190
If I come and grab you and take you into
the next room just to cool you down,

85
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:01,480
taking into a room against your will,
that's kidnapping.

86
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,940
So I think like they got them on a
technicality jam,

87
00:03:03,941 --> 00:03:06,220
like what they're doing with Frank Mir.
Some of these guys were talking about

88
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:07,570
and I said,
okay,

89
00:03:07,571 --> 00:03:08,770
is that what happened?
And he goes,

90
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,200
no,
I duct taped the games in my trunk and

91
00:03:11,201 --> 00:03:13,290
then I held him in the house for a week
before I let him go.

92
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,250
Well,
the why didn't you tell me?

93
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:20,440
Why did you bring up the initial example
of taking me next door and cooling me

94
00:03:20,441 --> 00:03:21,820
debt?
What that have to do?

95
00:03:21,821 --> 00:03:25,690
I still don't know because he's crazy.
Very kangaroo looking.

96
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:27,730
Yeah.
To kangaroos.

97
00:03:27,731 --> 00:03:31,060
Scare the fuck out of me.
Now all the sudden they started getting

98
00:03:31,061 --> 00:03:35,770
jacked.
You saw a lot of that when I was a kid

99
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,590
when I was a kid.
Do you think they lift?

100
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,453
Yeah,
they definitely.

101
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:43,810
They looked like they were fucking
school teachers.

102
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,320
Like they were newspaper reporters or
something,

103
00:03:47,321 --> 00:03:50,200
or like a librarian.
They didn't look like these yoke

104
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:52,450
monsters.
You see the one that's knocking on the

105
00:03:52,451 --> 00:03:54,790
window of the person's house like,
I want to come in.

106
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:58,720
Have you seen that video yet?
They wouldn't let a man knocking on the

107
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:00,460
door.
Come on.

108
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:04,000
Look how big that thing is.
That's one of their big.

109
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:04,923
Yeah,
look at that.

110
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:09,760
Like what?
What in the fuck is that?

111
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:12,550
That's fake.
I've seen it live,

112
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:17,680
so what the hell is going on?
Do you think they have that extra muscle

113
00:04:17,681 --> 00:04:18,670
thing?
Like you said,

114
00:04:18,671 --> 00:04:21,550
taking Dick Pills,
steroids and dick pills,

115
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:24,290
left fucking bizarre animal.
That is.

116
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:27,910
That is amazing.
Bouncy mammo that will kick you and try

117
00:04:27,911 --> 00:04:29,110
to hurt you.
Fuck you up.

118
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:30,290
No,
no,

119
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:30,591
no,
no,

120
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:30,881
no,
no,

121
00:04:30,881 --> 00:04:31,391
no,
no.

122
00:04:31,391 --> 00:04:32,940
They're not.
Always sit there and feed them.

123
00:04:32,941 --> 00:04:35,800
I fit.
I felt the big pictures of me.

124
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:40,170
You to be really careful around the real
serious.

125
00:04:40,171 --> 00:04:42,820
At a real post.
They say though,

126
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,950
they say though that if you find them in
the wild,

127
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:48,310
you are not supposed to ever while
beating off.

128
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:50,760
Is that kangaroo meat?
No,

129
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,680
no son.
We saw to having sex.

130
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:57,310
Oh,
the video though that it's kind of went

131
00:04:57,311 --> 00:05:01,720
around last week is a kangaroo seeing
its reflection in somebody's window and

132
00:05:01,721 --> 00:05:03,220
it's trying to fight it so.

133
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,420
But the guys on the other side with the
camera and it's just as jacked like

134
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,780
kangaroo,
like punching the window.

135
00:05:07,781 --> 00:05:09,220
Like,
like it's scary.

136
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,770
Well yeah,
it's one of the coolest video that came

137
00:05:11,771 --> 00:05:13,540
out last week.
If you just type in a kangaroo,

138
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:15,850
a window fist fighting himself in a
window,

139
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:19,780
shadowboxing a window.
That's a weird animal.

140
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,580
I love them.
I think they're great,

141
00:05:21,581 --> 00:05:25,570
but it's so weird what it does.
Like the way it acts that sits on its

142
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:26,890
tail,
we.

143
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,070
It's bouncing around these legs and then
it's got those jacks.

144
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,350
Upper Body.
They were.

145
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,120
There was like a.
They get spooked.

146
00:05:34,121 --> 00:05:37,450
Easy to like this one big one was trying
to have sex.

147
00:05:37,451 --> 00:05:39,520
I'm going to say it wasn't sex.
It was definitely rape,

148
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,820
but it was like he was pulling her back
and she was trying to get away,

149
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:46,450
but there was a reason she was trying to
get away because there was like a weird

150
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,800
wind come that want to keen.

151
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,200
They all scattered.
Then they went under the tree and then

152
00:05:50,201 --> 00:05:51,670
they got into it and I was like,
oh,

153
00:05:51,671 --> 00:05:55,900
maybe she just wanted some privacy or.
That was really interesting how they had

154
00:05:55,901 --> 00:05:58,790
to sneak out,
but she was scared and then as soon as

155
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,620
this weird thing came,
it was like a wind.

156
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,280
They all went scattered and then they
got back into.

157
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:06,830
It was exciting.
I liked Kanga.

158
00:06:06,831 --> 00:06:08,120
Yeah,
this is.

159
00:06:08,121 --> 00:06:10,190
It is scary.
I mean,

160
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,250
knock on the door.
That one's not too jacked.

161
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,320
Boy.
It's creepy though.

162
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,210
Oh my God.
Why?

163
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,840
It says,
and he starts getting pissed.

164
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:23,210
You scratched my window.
Small window.

165
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:29,440
This is the right video or maybe
the mirror.

166
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,160
Oh my God.
He's thrown himself at the window.

167
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:37,730
Fuck man.
He's trying to test themselves.

168
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:40,120
Oh.
Oh.

169
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:44,840
He's trying to fight what he sees as a
reflection in the window.

170
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,100
Okay.
Whoa.

171
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,470
Okay.
