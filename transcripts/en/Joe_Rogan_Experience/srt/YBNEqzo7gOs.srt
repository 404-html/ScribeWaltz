1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:03,630
Her freak bitches.
Sure.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,070
I agree with you.
Can I switch gears?

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,130
Yeah,
I've got to ask you about that.

4
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:07,110
Yeah.
Ask me about anything.

5
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,510
Joey Diaz.
Tell me everything.

6
00:00:09,511 --> 00:00:11,200
How did you meet Joe Diaz?
Cause I want,

7
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:15,630
cause then I want you to ask me this.
I want you to ask me what my experience

8
00:00:15,631 --> 00:00:17,130
with Joe,
but how did you meet him?

9
00:00:17,131 --> 00:00:18,270
How did he come into the fold?

10
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:21,670
I met Joey Diaz in the late nineties,
uh,

11
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,430
at the comedy store.
I think I met him in [inaudible] 96 or

12
00:00:24,431 --> 00:00:25,780
97,
something like that.

13
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,540
Uh,
right when Joey moved to La,

14
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:30,160
we just started hanging around the
comedy store.

15
00:00:30,161 --> 00:00:31,870
We became friends and then,
uh,

16
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,220
I started taking him on the road with
me.

17
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:34,810
Like,
uh,

18
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,930
the late nineties.
We've been best friends forever,

19
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:41,330
so I know of Joey.
I don't know Joey.

20
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:43,280
I've never met him.
Never met Joe.

21
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:44,830
Never.
I call him up right now.

22
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:46,760
TV and the whole bit.
And you know,

23
00:00:46,761 --> 00:00:49,070
I know him from,
from immediately when I see your podcast

24
00:00:49,071 --> 00:00:49,641
and all that.
But,

25
00:00:49,641 --> 00:00:51,590
and he's in the circles.
He does some Jujitsu.

26
00:00:51,591 --> 00:00:53,720
He's funnier than hell.
And he's a gangster.

27
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:55,640
So I like him,
but I don't know anything about him.

28
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:58,910
So he comes on my podcast now he has a
podcast.

29
00:00:58,911 --> 00:01:00,710
So of course my opening line to them is,
hey,

30
00:01:00,711 --> 00:01:01,670
how'd you get into pocket?
Right?

31
00:01:01,671 --> 00:01:04,190
I'm going to put here,
here's your plug for your podcast,

32
00:01:04,191 --> 00:01:05,810
and we're going to go on and talk about
my agenda.

33
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:07,490
So I say,
Joe,

34
00:01:07,491 --> 00:01:09,260
I say to him,
Joey,

35
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:11,930
how'd you get into podcasting?
And his response,

36
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,380
you know,
chill.

37
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,290
Sudden he wouldn't call me jail.
It was always shit.

38
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,330
You know what?
Chill still calls me Joe Rogan.

39
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:22,220
I'm mugged a hooker down in New Jersey
and senator Lee set her wig on fire.

40
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:24,921
It's like,
okay,

41
00:01:24,921 --> 00:01:26,570
we got two,
there's two moving parts here.

42
00:01:26,571 --> 00:01:27,410
First off,
that is,

43
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,960
I don't know how that answers my
question of how,

44
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:34,070
but now I need to know the story here.
So we ties it all together with,

45
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:36,980
he went on something,
just something,

46
00:01:36,981 --> 00:01:39,270
he got an appearance.
He told the story of mugging her,

47
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,510
a hooker in New Jersey and setting her
wig on fire.

48
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:43,670
And all of a sudden he blew up overnight
and he goes,

49
00:01:43,671 --> 00:01:45,080
yeah,
I realized people like the stores.

50
00:01:45,081 --> 00:01:48,620
I never knew that I had stories from the
part of the country I'm in and the

51
00:01:48,621 --> 00:01:50,870
neighborhood I grew up in,
I thought everybody had these stories.

52
00:01:50,871 --> 00:01:51,561
He's like,
chill center.

53
00:01:51,561 --> 00:01:54,020
And I thought I'd tell you I Mugu Hooker
and light her wig on fire.

54
00:01:54,021 --> 00:01:54,471
You Go,
yeah,

55
00:01:54,471 --> 00:01:56,900
well I'm up 10 hookers and let 10 wigs
on fire.

56
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,670
It's like I didn't know I had stories.

57
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:02,440
And then it just goes from there.
And he starts telling me about so,

58
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,180
so he,
so he ends up doing two years or 18

59
00:02:05,181 --> 00:02:06,020
months.
And I said,

60
00:02:06,021 --> 00:02:07,790
well,
what kind of jam did you get in there?

61
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:08,624
And he said,
well,

62
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,670
I was actually,
I was doing the cop's job for him.

63
00:02:10,671 --> 00:02:11,930
You know,
the cops don't want drugs on the

64
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:13,850
streets.
I went and took two kilos off the

65
00:02:13,851 --> 00:02:17,050
streets for him.
This is how he presents it to me.

66
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:17,601
He goes,
yeah,

67
00:02:17,601 --> 00:02:20,540
you know,
the two kilos wasn't as big of a deal.

68
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:21,440
Oh.
He said,

69
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,330
oh,
so I robbed two kilos.

70
00:02:23,331 --> 00:02:24,830
He goes and you know what else?
Chill.

71
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,200
Sudden I just happened to have a machine
gun.

72
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:28,641
And I go,
well,

73
00:02:28,641 --> 00:02:31,370
I can see where that happening because
she has some times you just back into a

74
00:02:31,371 --> 00:02:33,620
machine.
I had a machine gun with me and he goes,

75
00:02:33,621 --> 00:02:35,600
but it's funny,
I wasn't in trouble for the gun.

76
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,090
I really wasn't that much trouble for
the drugs.

77
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:40,160
What they were upset about was the
kidnapping.

78
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,211
I'm going,
okay,

79
00:02:41,211 --> 00:02:42,770
what?
What happened?

80
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,630
And this is my intro to the guy.
I'm like,

81
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:46,310
what?
What in the hell is this story?

82
00:02:46,311 --> 00:02:47,780
You probably know the story,
but I did it.

83
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:49,940
So he tells me the whole story.
He says,

84
00:02:49,941 --> 00:02:50,451
yeah,
but you know,

85
00:02:50,451 --> 00:02:53,450
kidnappings kind of a weird charge
because when you and vandelay gotten

86
00:02:53,451 --> 00:02:56,390
that scuffle in the ultimate fighter,
if I come and grab you and I take you

87
00:02:56,391 --> 00:02:58,220
into the next room just to cool you
down,

88
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:01,480
taking into a room against your will,
that's kidnapping.

89
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,940
So I think like they got him on a
technicality jam,

90
00:03:03,941 --> 00:03:06,220
like what they're doing with Frank Mir.
Some of these guys were talking about

91
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:07,570
and I said,
okay,

92
00:03:07,571 --> 00:03:08,770
is that what happened?
And he goes,

93
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,110
no.
I duct taped the guy who was in my trunk

94
00:03:11,111 --> 00:03:13,350
and then I held him in the house for a
week before I let them go like,

95
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,280
well,
the why didn't you tell me?

96
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:20,440
Why did you bring up the initial example
of taking me next door and cooling me

97
00:03:20,441 --> 00:03:21,850
debt?
What that have to do?

98
00:03:21,851 --> 00:03:26,851
I still don't know because he's crazy.
Very kangaroo looking to Kangaroos scare

99
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:31,060
the fuck out of me.
Now all of a sudden they started getting

100
00:03:31,061 --> 00:03:34,230
jacks.
We saw a lot of that in Australia.

101
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,740
We're in balance.
When I was a kid,

102
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,590
when I was a kid.
Do you think they lift?

103
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,453
Yeah,
they definitely,

104
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,820
they check.
They looked like they were like fucking

105
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:46,750
school teachers.
Like they were newspaper reporters or

106
00:03:46,751 --> 00:03:51,100
something or like a librarian.
He didn't look like these yoke monsters.

107
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:54,400
You see the one that's knocking on the
window of the person's house like I want

108
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:55,690
to come in.
Have you seen that video yet?

109
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,510
This jack came knocking on the door.
Look up,

110
00:03:59,511 --> 00:04:00,460
look at them.
Come on.

111
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:04,150
Look how big that thing is.
There is big look.

112
00:04:04,151 --> 00:04:04,984
Yeah,
look it up.

113
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:11,110
What in the fuck is that?
That's fake.

114
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,490
I've seen it live.
So what the hell is going on?

115
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:18,670
Do you think they have that extra muscle
thing like you said,

116
00:04:18,671 --> 00:04:23,671
taking take pills or steroids and dicto
fucking bizarre animal that is,

117
00:04:24,281 --> 00:04:27,910
that is amazing.
Bouncy mammal that will kick you and try

118
00:04:27,911 --> 00:04:29,140
to hurt you.
Fuck you up.

119
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:30,281
No,
no,

120
00:04:30,281 --> 00:04:30,581
no,
no,

121
00:04:30,581 --> 00:04:30,881
no,
no,

122
00:04:30,881 --> 00:04:31,401
no,
no.

123
00:04:31,401 --> 00:04:34,230
They're not always nice.
I felt the big guy.

124
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:39,100
You gotta be really careful around that.
Real.

125
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,660
Is that a real post?
Yes.

126
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:44,470
They say though,
they say though that if you find them in

127
00:04:44,471 --> 00:04:49,471
the wild you are not supposed to ever
approach to beating off is that can't

128
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:50,450
move.
Eat.

129
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:51,830
No,
no son.

130
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,660
We saw two having sex.
Whoa.

131
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:59,650
The video though that it's kind of went
around last week is a kangaroo sing its

132
00:04:59,651 --> 00:05:02,740
reflection in somebody's window and it's
trying to fight it.

133
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,510
So,
but the guys on the other side with the

134
00:05:04,511 --> 00:05:06,790
camera and it's just as jacked like
kangaroo,

135
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:09,220
like punching the window.
Like it's scary.

136
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:10,570
Well.
Yeah,

137
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:12,160
it's one of the coolest video that came
out last week.

138
00:05:12,161 --> 00:05:14,350
If you just type in a kangaroo,
a window,

139
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:17,350
this fighting himself in a window,
shadowboxing,

140
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:19,780
a window.
That's a weird animal.

141
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,550
I love them.
I think they're great,

142
00:05:21,551 --> 00:05:25,600
but it's so weird what it does,
like the way it acts that sits on its

143
00:05:25,601 --> 00:05:27,120
tail.
We spend,

144
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:30,070
it's bouncing around these legs and then
it's got those jacks,

145
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,350
upper body.
They were,

146
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,120
there was like a,
they get spooked.

147
00:05:34,121 --> 00:05:37,450
Easy to like this one big one was trying
to have sex.

148
00:05:37,451 --> 00:05:39,520
I'm going to say it wasn't sex.
It was definitely rape,

149
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:42,820
but it was like he was pulling her back
and she was trying to get away,

150
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:46,480
but there was a reason she was trying to
get away because there was like a weird

151
00:05:46,481 --> 00:05:46,960
wing come.

152
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,910
They want to keen.
They all scattered.

153
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,370
Then they went under the tree and then
they got into it and I was like,

154
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,290
oh,
maybe she just wanted some privacy or,

155
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:56,620
that was really interesting how they had
to sneak out.

156
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,570
But she was scared.
And then as soon as this weird thing

157
00:05:59,571 --> 00:06:00,620
came,
it was like a wind.

158
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,310
They all went scattered and then they
got back into,

159
00:06:04,311 --> 00:06:06,830
it was exciting.
I liked Kanga.

160
00:06:06,831 --> 00:06:08,270
Yeah.
This is it.

161
00:06:08,271 --> 00:06:10,150
This is so scary.
I mean,

162
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:13,250
so it's you knock on the door.
That one's not too jacked.

163
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:14,540
Boy.
Boy,

164
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,010
it's creepy though.
You haven't looked at it.

165
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:17,960
All.
My God,

166
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:21,350
watch this and he starts getting pissed.
You scratched my window.

167
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:26,060
Can you scratch my window?
This is not the right video.

168
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:27,270
Or maybe,
I guess.

169
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,370
Yes.
Yeah,

170
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:32,150
he's the mirror.
Oh my God.

171
00:06:32,151 --> 00:06:36,230
He's throwing himself at the window.
Fuck man.

172
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:38,300
He's trying to chess by himself.
Oh.

173
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:40,190
Oh.
Oh.

174
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:44,840
He's trying to fight what he sees as a
reflection in the window.

175
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,143
Okay,
whoa.

176
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:55,970
Yeah.
