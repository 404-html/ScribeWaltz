1
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,550
And we're live,
it's going on.

2
00:00:08,551 --> 00:00:09,990
Where did you sleep?
Well last night.

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:12,450
I did.
I didn't sleep that badly.

4
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,550
I mean,
hotels are a tough thing.

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:19,600
Um,
and we actually know the science that 

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,430
I'm one half of your brain will actually
not sleep as deeply than the other when 

7
00:00:22,621 --> 00:00:24,780
you're sleeping in a,
an unusual room,

8
00:00:24,781 --> 00:00:26,190
like a hotel room.
Really,

9
00:00:26,191 --> 00:00:28,980
that's what fucks me up when I'm on the 
road,

10
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,190
you know,
I'll do three different hotels in a week

11
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:34,020
because I'll do like a Thursday,
Friday,

12
00:00:34,021 --> 00:00:39,021
Saturday,
like with gigs and then by the time 

13
00:00:39,021 --> 00:00:39,021
Sunday rolls around,
I'm a mess in rough shape.

14
00:00:39,021 --> 00:00:39,930
Yeah.
Is that what it is?

15
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,130
Yeah.
And it's a union.

16
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:45,360
It's a threat detection thing.
I mean if you look at other species,

17
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,150
they can do this much more impressively 
than we can.

18
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:53,420
So dolphins or any sort of sea dwelling 
memo can actually sleep with half a 

19
00:00:54,451 --> 00:00:54,870
brain.

20
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,440
So one half of that brain goes into deep
sleep.

21
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,810
The other half is wide awake.
That's how people,

22
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:03,630
the DMV do it.
Those people that work at the department

23
00:01:03,631 --> 00:01:05,460
of motor vehicles,
they're there.

24
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:08,490
They work half asleep.
You ever meet him?

25
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,600
I haven't.
No.

26
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,870
Just teasing the DMV.
Listening.

27
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:16,880
Going fuck you man.
Next time you come in and get your 

28
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:16,880
license renewed.
That was my next NIH grant.

29
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,870
I think looking at the DMV and sleep.
But yeah,

30
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:20,520
we ESA workers.
Same thing,

31
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:22,860
same,
same type of human that I've come across

32
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:24,900
them too.
I'm just kidding.

33
00:01:24,901 --> 00:01:25,780
Fuckers.
Relax.

34
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:29,700
Um,
so when you're in a hotel room,

35
00:01:29,701 --> 00:01:34,110
what is happening that you're half.
Your brain is not really sleeping.

36
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,810
Yeah.
So there's different stages of sleep.

37
00:01:36,811 --> 00:01:41,811
There are two principle types.
One is non rapid eye movement sleep or 

38
00:01:41,811 --> 00:01:42,690
non rem sleep.
The other is rem sleep,

39
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:47,250
which is also known as dream sleep and 
non rapid eye movement.

40
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:50,160
Sleep is further divided into four 
separate stages,

41
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:55,800
which are unimaginatively called stages 
one through four were a creative bunch 

42
00:01:55,891 --> 00:01:59,880
is easy to remember that it is true,
but I think it's also a low Iq,

43
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:05,300
but it's the deep stages of sleep.
Three and four of that non rapid eye 

44
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:08,991
movement.
That's where a lot of sort of body 

45
00:02:08,991 --> 00:02:08,991
replenishment takes place.
Grief,

46
00:02:08,991 --> 00:02:10,500
the cardiovascular system,
metabolism,

47
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:15,530
all of those good things,
but that's the deep sleep that one half 

48
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,431
of your brain will resist going into 
when you're sleeping in a foreign 

49
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:23,991
environment.
So it stays in this kind of lighter 

50
00:02:23,991 --> 00:02:24,060
stage,
almost like a threat detection system.

51
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,490
And you can imagine why,
you know,

52
00:02:26,491 --> 00:02:28,650
it's an unusual context,
evolutionarily.

53
00:02:28,651 --> 00:02:33,651
It would make a lot of sense to just 
have that sort of on guard one half of 

54
00:02:33,651 --> 00:02:36,780
the brain that makes so much sense.
And that really for me,

55
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:39,780
it fills in the blanks of like why even 
if I get,

56
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:40,830
you know,
seven,

57
00:02:40,831 --> 00:02:44,460
eight hour sleep on the road,
I'm still kind of just out of it.

58
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,050
Yeah.
And that's in fact,

59
00:02:46,051 --> 00:02:49,680
probably one of the,
I think the most impressive parts of new

60
00:02:49,681 --> 00:02:52,350
research on sleep.
It's not just about quantity,

61
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:57,590
it's also about quality and quality can 
be as detrimental if you don't get it as

62
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,760
a reduction in total quality.
I mean both are essential,

63
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,070
but I think it speaks exactly to your 
point.

64
00:03:03,071 --> 00:03:06,580
You just don't feel like it's a 
refreshing sort of deep sleep.

65
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:07,900
Um,
yeah,

66
00:03:07,901 --> 00:03:09,210
it feels totally different.
Um,

67
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:14,490
it just feels like,
I guess I would say it feels like half 

68
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:14,490
asleep.
Yeah,

69
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:15,910
me too.
It's really kind of out does feel.

70
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:21,870
One of the things that I noticed,
I did this thing with my friends called 

71
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:22,290
sober October where we,
um,

72
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:25,600
didn't smoke any pot or do any,
no drinking at all,

73
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:28,900
nothing for a month.
And when I did it,

74
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,690
one of the things I found was that after
about,

75
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:37,140
I don't know how many days,
but it was noticeable that I would have 

76
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:37,840
these incredibly vivid dreams.

77
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:43,230
And then I had read that marijuana does 
something to suppress heavy rem sleep.

78
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:45,830
Like what,
what,

79
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,220
what is happening there?
Yeah.

80
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,470
So both of those chemicals,
both of which are used as a sleep aid,

81
00:03:50,471 --> 00:03:54,520
alcohol and marijuana are actually very 
good at blocking your dream sleep,

82
00:03:54,521 --> 00:03:55,840
your rapid eye movement,
sleep.

83
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:59,920
And so what happens is that the brain is
quite clever in this regard.

84
00:03:59,921 --> 00:04:04,921
It builds up a clock counter of how much
dream sleep you should have had but have

85
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:09,130
not been getting.
And it starts to develop this increasing

86
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:12,730
appetite and hunger for dream sleep.
So that finally,

87
00:04:12,731 --> 00:04:15,010
when the alcohol actually gets out of 
your system,

88
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,360
sober October,
the love of the day,

89
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:22,950
that's all of a sudden where you get 
what's called a rem sleep rebound 

90
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,100
effect,
where you not only get the normal amount

91
00:04:24,101 --> 00:04:25,930
of rem sleep that you would normally 
have,

92
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,320
you get that,
plus the brain tries to get back some of

93
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:34,210
that dream sleep that it's been losing 
over the past maybe 11 months.

94
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,580
Um,
so you get this 20 years.

95
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,980
I didn't want to make any assumptions of
uh,

96
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:40,630
so,
um,

97
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:45,870
so you get this rem sleep rebounded 
effect and that's where you have these 

98
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:46,470
really intense dream sleep.
Um,

99
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:48,790
situations.
It's the same reason that people,

100
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,880
they'll say like,
I had a bit too much to drink last 

101
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:53,880
night.
Maybe it was a Friday or Saturday.

102
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,640
They sleep in late.
They say,

103
00:04:54,641 --> 00:04:59,050
I just had these crazy dreams.
What happens there is a kind of an acute

104
00:04:59,051 --> 00:05:04,051
version where the alcohol is swilling 
around in your system and after about 

105
00:05:04,051 --> 00:05:08,761
six hours,
your liver and your kidneys to finally 

106
00:05:08,761 --> 00:05:11,761
excrete it,
all of the alcohol and your brain has 

107
00:05:11,761 --> 00:05:12,640
been deprived of dream sleep for that 
first six hours.

108
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:17,910
So then it feast in the last couple of 
hours and that's why you have these 

109
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:19,990
really bizarre dreams after you've been 
drinking a little bit too much.

110
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:25,110
Oh Wow.
So what is happening with marijuana 

111
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:25,420
though specifically?
Do you know?

112
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,670
Yeah,
so marijuana,

113
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,850
it does help.
People will help it.

114
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,770
It puts people to sleep quicker.
Although I think the question is whether

115
00:05:35,771 --> 00:05:38,230
it's really naturalistic sleep or not,
that they go into.

116
00:05:38,231 --> 00:05:43,231
Certainly with alcohol,
it's not that nightcap idea is a 

117
00:05:43,231 --> 00:05:45,520
misnomer.
Alcohol will actually will.

118
00:05:45,521 --> 00:05:49,270
It's a form of drugs that we call the 
sedatives and sedation is not sleep.

119
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,060
It's very different,
but we often mistake one for the other.

120
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:56,200
Marijuana seems to act in a 
physiologically for a different way.

121
00:05:56,201 --> 00:05:58,550
It doesn't target the same receptors in 
the brain,

122
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:03,940
so it's unclear with the speed with 
which you fall asleep after having a 

123
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,170
session with marijuana is actually 
natural sleep.

124
00:06:06,171 --> 00:06:08,660
Let's assume it is the problem,
however.

125
00:06:08,661 --> 00:06:11,660
Is that it?
Then we'll start to disrupt rem sleep.

126
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,000
It will start to block the process.

127
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,190
We think perhaps at the level of the 
brainstem,

128
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:21,220
which is where these two types of sleep,
non rem and rem sleep will actually get 

129
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:25,661
sort of worked out.
That's where marijuana may actually 

130
00:06:25,661 --> 00:06:26,450
impact dream sleep and shut it down and 
block it.

131
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:29,360
Have there been any studies on chronic 
marijuana smokers,

132
00:06:29,361 --> 00:06:30,440
like those,
uh,

133
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:34,190
dawn to dusk type characters that just 
are constantly high?

134
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:39,320
Like what happens to their brain from 
not because they must never hit rem 

135
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:39,920
sleep.
Yeah.

136
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:43,910
So people haven't looked at marijuana.
They have looked at alcohol though.

137
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:49,420
Exactly that.
So what happens is if you look at 

138
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,490
alcoholics,
they will have some thing often when 

139
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:54,170
they come off alcohol,
something called Delirium Tremens,

140
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:59,680
which is where sort of Dt I'm there.
What happens is that the alcohol has 

141
00:06:59,871 --> 00:07:04,871
been blocking dream sleep for so long 
and the pressure for dream sleep has 

142
00:07:04,871 --> 00:07:06,260
built up so powerfully in the brain.

143
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:11,390
It actually just spills over into 
wakefulness and so the brain just says,

144
00:07:11,391 --> 00:07:11,960
look,
okay,

145
00:07:11,961 --> 00:07:15,080
if I'm not going to get this dream sleep
whilst you're asleep,

146
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:17,300
I'm just going to take it whilst you're 
awake,

147
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,540
and so you start to essentially dream 
while you're awake.

148
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:23,240
It's this sort of collision of two 
states of consciousness,

149
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,090
so you get delirium.
Wow.

150
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,000
I always thought the dts.
We're detoxing other one.

151
00:07:29,001 --> 00:07:30,780
Someone said someone's going through the
dts.

152
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:31,300
Okay.
Yeah.

153
00:07:31,301 --> 00:07:32,810
So it's delirium.
Tremor,

154
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:33,590
yeah.
Delirium.

155
00:07:33,591 --> 00:07:34,330
Tremens.
Yeah.

156
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,080
Sort of.
So what,

157
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:38,990
like what is going on with them when 
this is happening.

158
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:42,890
So if they are going through this 
delirium during the day,

159
00:07:42,891 --> 00:07:46,190
while they're conscious,
what's physiologically happening?

160
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,400
So it's almost as though the veil of rem
sleep gets pulled over the waking brain 

161
00:07:51,861 --> 00:07:56,861
as it were.
So you have this mixed state of 

162
00:07:56,861 --> 00:07:58,781
consciousness that you can pick up with 
brain wave recordings and he just tells 

163
00:07:59,001 --> 00:08:04,001
me,
I mean in some ways how necessary sleep 

164
00:08:04,001 --> 00:08:08,231
must be if that's the length that the 
brain will go to to get that which it's 

165
00:08:08,231 --> 00:08:11,230
been missing,
just shows you why,

166
00:08:11,231 --> 00:08:16,231
you know,
it took mother nature three point 6 

167
00:08:16,231 --> 00:08:18,850
million years to put this thing called 
anytown asleep necessity in place and 

168
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:23,381
we've come along and within the space of
100 years we've locked up almost 20 

169
00:08:23,381 --> 00:08:23,381
percent of that.

170
00:08:23,381 --> 00:08:24,530
If you look at the data,
wow,

171
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,850
really know so many people take pride in
that too.

172
00:08:28,851 --> 00:08:30,710
I don't need eight hour sleep.
I got three.

173
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:35,711
I'm good,
ready to go kick ass and dominate the 

174
00:08:35,711 --> 00:08:35,711
world.
This sort of like sleep,

175
00:08:35,711 --> 00:08:38,660
machismo attitude.
There is a lot of that,

176
00:08:38,661 --> 00:08:39,410
right?
Yeah.

177
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:41,260
Baby.
Alex Lee.

178
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:43,940
Well,
I mean you'd be glad to know that.

179
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:46,700
Then you know,
men who sleep five to six hours a night,

180
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:51,730
we'll have a level of testosterone which
is that of someone 10 years their 

181
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,330
senior.
So lack of sleep will age.

182
00:08:53,331 --> 00:08:56,430
You buy a decade in terms of that 
particular aspect

183
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:57,810
of wellness for realty,
neck,

184
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,020
muscle strength.
Sexual performance.

185
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:00,300
Yeah.

186
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:02,210
Credible.
Wow.

187
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,210
We had a woman on the podcast,
her name is Courtney [inaudible],

188
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,820
Walter and cheese,
a ultra marathon runner.

189
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:10,640
And she ran a.
she's a real freak.

190
00:09:10,641 --> 00:09:12,830
I mean,
like an incredible athlete.

191
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,130
She ran this thing called the Moab to 
40.

192
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:21,580
It's 238 miles through the Moab 
Mountains and she did it 22 miles faster

193
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:30,290
than the second place man.
So she won it by like a whopping,

194
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,320
I think it was 10 hours,
10 hours ahead of the second place 

195
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,770
winner.
And she slept one minute,

196
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,940
one minute the entire time.
She tried to lie.

197
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:44,980
This is over three days.
I think it took her less than three 

198
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:44,980
days.
I think it took her like two days.

199
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:49,910
Um,
she slept for one minute during the 

200
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:51,710
entire time,
but she tried to lie down.

201
00:09:51,711 --> 00:09:53,870
She,
she said she laid down for a few minutes

202
00:09:53,871 --> 00:09:58,871
but she couldn't fall asleep.
And then she wound up actually just 

203
00:09:58,871 --> 00:09:58,940
taking one minute and going to sleep.

204
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:04,150
And she said that one minute was like 
one of the most intense restful minutes 

205
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:08,651
after that minute is over,
she was woken up because she told her 

206
00:10:08,651 --> 00:10:09,950
partner running partner to wake her up 
at a minute and she's like,

207
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,840
how long did you let me sleep?
And he was like,

208
00:10:11,841 --> 00:10:12,980
one minute.
She was like,

209
00:10:12,981 --> 00:10:13,850
wow,
I feel great,

210
00:10:13,851 --> 00:10:16,820
let's go.
But she was saying that she hallucinates

211
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
and that she starts seeing like rabbits 
or talking to her and she sees things 

212
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,110
that aren't there and like mystical 
beings and stuff.

213
00:10:24,111 --> 00:10:29,111
She said it's really freaky,
but she knows that she's hallucinating 

214
00:10:29,111 --> 00:10:31,070
because she's done this.
She's done a bunch of an ultra marathon.

215
00:10:31,071 --> 00:10:36,071
So she just keeps going.
She just keeps going and she's like 

216
00:10:36,071 --> 00:10:36,071
saying hi to rabbits there talking to 
her and stuff.

217
00:10:36,071 --> 00:10:36,071
Yeah,

218
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:40,910
I mean you see these reports too.
I mean this is a race of cycling,

219
00:10:40,911 --> 00:10:45,911
race of thing.
His bike across America just got to go 

220
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:46,520
from east coast to west coast in a 
shorter time as possible.

221
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:49,910
And that exactly what they do too.
It's all about managing how little sleep

222
00:10:49,911 --> 00:10:54,911
that you get.
And they will explain these wild 

223
00:10:54,911 --> 00:10:58,030
hallucinogenic experiences on the bike.
If you look at world records for people 

224
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:00,920
who have tried to sort of go without 
sleep.

225
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:05,840
And one of the most famous examples is a
radio disc jockey called Peter trip back

226
00:11:05,841 --> 00:11:07,000
in the,
um,

227
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,350
it was back in the sort of sixties,
fifties,

228
00:11:09,351 --> 00:11:12,830
sixties.
And he tried to break the world record.

229
00:11:12,831 --> 00:11:15,140
He went eight days straight.
Um,

230
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,350
and yeah,
no sleep.

231
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,550
Yeah,
he was broadcasting from time square.

232
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,300
He would do is show the.
And you know,

233
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:23,630
the scientists,
the psychiatrist said,

234
00:11:23,631 --> 00:11:25,340
look,
this is a very bad idea based on what we

235
00:11:25,341 --> 00:11:26,210
know,
please don't do it.

236
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:27,650
And he said,
I'm going to do it anyway.

237
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:30,110
And then the scientists being a good 
scientist,

238
00:11:30,111 --> 00:11:31,010
they said,
great,

239
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,380
do you mind if we study here because 
it'd be a great paper to sort of,

240
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,310
you know,
to write up.

241
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:39,730
And they tracked him.
And by day three he was having Florid 

242
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:43,010
delusions and hallucinations.
He was seeing spiders in his shoes.

243
00:11:43,011 --> 00:11:48,011
He became desperately paranoid.
He started to think that people were 

244
00:11:48,011 --> 00:11:49,400
trying to poison him in his food.
One point,

245
00:11:49,401 --> 00:11:54,401
it was the middle of winter,
some guys came in with sort of these 

246
00:11:54,401 --> 00:11:56,900
barriers.
New York winter came in with these big 

247
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,251
jackets.
He thought it was the secret service 

248
00:11:59,251 --> 00:11:59,251
coming to get him and he ran out into 
the road,

249
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,800
you know,
these are strange,

250
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:06,060
but so we know that that same profile of
just starting to become psychotic,

251
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:10,810
which is essentially what happens 
naturally when you dream that you are,

252
00:12:10,811 --> 00:12:12,880
I mean all of us here,
you know,

253
00:12:12,881 --> 00:12:16,720
as long as we slept last night,
became flagrantly psychotic when we went

254
00:12:16,721 --> 00:12:20,110
into dream sleep because you start to 
see things which are not there.

255
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:25,380
So you hallucinate,
you believe things that couldn't 

256
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:25,380
possibly be true.
So you're delusional.

257
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:28,180
You get confused about time,
place and person.

258
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:32,860
So you're suffering from disorientation.
You have wildly fluctuating emotions.

259
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:36,190
Something that psychiatrist called being
sort of effectively label.

260
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:41,610
And then how wonderful.
We both woke up this morning and we 

261
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:41,770
forgot most if not all of that dream 
experience.

262
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:42,080
So,
uh,

263
00:12:42,081 --> 00:12:43,210
suffering from Amnesia,

264
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:49,940
what is happening when you're having 
these hallucinogenic experiences?

265
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,550
Like what are the chemicals that are 
causing.

266
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:53,190
Do we know?

267
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,410
We do.
Yeah.

268
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:57,860
And so we've done some of these studies 
where we put people into brain scanners,

269
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:03,070
we let them fall asleep,
and then we see what happens within the 

270
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:03,410
brain,
which parts of the brain of switching on

271
00:13:03,411 --> 00:13:07,370
which parts of the brain of switching 
off when you go into rem sleep,

272
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:12,400
firstly some parts of your brain become 
30 percent more active than when you're 

273
00:13:12,471 --> 00:13:14,790
awake.
So you know,

274
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,130
we think of sleep as this sort of,
you know,

275
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,910
static,
passive state where everything just kind

276
00:13:19,911 --> 00:13:23,570
of drops down in terms of activity.
Quite the contrary.

277
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:29,470
But what's also interesting is that not 
all parts of the brain ramp up when you 

278
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:30,980
go into rem sleep,
visual parts of the brain,

279
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:36,040
increased motor parts of the brain,
increase emotional centers and memory 

280
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,170
centers.
They all increase,

281
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:41,240
but the part of the brain that bucks the
trend and goes in the opposite direction

282
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:44,180
is the part of the brain that we call 
the prefrontal cortex.

283
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,810
This sort of CEO of the brain that's 
very good at rational,

284
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:51,260
logical thinking.
That parts of the part of the brain gets

285
00:13:51,261 --> 00:13:54,860
shut off.
So it's almost as though you know the,

286
00:13:55,070 --> 00:14:00,070
the prison guards are gone and everyone 
runs a mark because there's no 

287
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:03,860
controller in place.
And so we know sort of from the patterns

288
00:14:03,861 --> 00:14:07,520
of brain activity,
why you become sort of so visual.

289
00:14:07,521 --> 00:14:10,910
You see things,
why you have motor kinesthetic activity,

290
00:14:10,911 --> 00:14:15,911
why things feel so emotional,
but also why things seem utterly 

291
00:14:15,911 --> 00:14:17,540
illogical and irrational because your 
frontal brain,

292
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:21,650
the thing that makes us most human,
you can say goodbye to that for the rest

293
00:14:21,651 --> 00:14:23,600
of dream sleep.
So there's no driver.

294
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,710
So there's no driver.
Yeah.

295
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:29,540
Now why do we forget?
Why do we forget those dreams?

296
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:30,310
Because I

297
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:35,590
wake up and I am sure that I'm going to 
remember these dreams and sometimes I 

298
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:37,160
do.
Sometimes our member and I don't think I

299
00:14:37,161 --> 00:14:41,960
really remember them.
I think what it is is very much like you

300
00:14:41,961 --> 00:14:45,650
ever hear someone talk about a memory 
from a long time ago.

301
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:50,180
I used to think that people actually 
remembered things from a long time ago,

302
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:53,540
but now what I as Dave remember 
remembering it,

303
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:59,110
I think they remember talking about it.
They remember how they described it and 

304
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:03,731
then they sort of remember that and 
repeat it and in their mind convinced 

305
00:15:03,731 --> 00:15:08,171
themselves that that's what happened 
because I've heard people tell stories 

306
00:15:08,171 --> 00:15:12,551
about the past and they're,
they vary wildly from what is absolutely

307
00:15:13,161 --> 00:15:14,060
true.
Like,

308
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,970
like factual.
You could check it,

309
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,100
you could research it,
you know what the facts are,

310
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:24,370
but in their mind it's very different 
and I think that it's entirely possible 

311
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:28,931
that what people are doing is 
remembering the recollection of these 

312
00:15:28,931 --> 00:15:33,200
memories and how they told them and then
also sort of people elaborate things and

313
00:15:33,201 --> 00:15:36,410
make themselves look better or make the 
situation look more dramatic.

314
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,170
But with dreams that doesn't make any 
sense.

315
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:45,380
So I was always trying to figure out 
like what is it about a dream where 

316
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:49,191
sometimes I can remember the dream and 
sometimes it's so vivid when I wake up,

317
00:15:50,401 --> 00:15:51,480
I'm like,
holy shit,

318
00:15:51,481 --> 00:15:53,010
that was crazy.
What a dream.

319
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,870
And then I forget it 20 minutes later.

320
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:57,230
Great.
What is that soup firstly?

321
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,670
I mean,
one theory of dreaming is that it's just

322
00:15:59,671 --> 00:16:02,580
simply a reconstruction when you wake 
up.

323
00:16:02,581 --> 00:16:07,581
So you have these fragments of activity 
and what your cortex does when it wakes 

324
00:16:07,581 --> 00:16:08,790
up is what your cortex is designed to do
when you're awake normally,

325
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:11,780
which is try to package everything,
can make a good story,

326
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:15,360
make logical fit out of the world.
That's one theory.

327
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:17,780
I don't believe that though.
Um,

328
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:20,250
your,
your point is a really interesting one.

329
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:23,500
Do I remember my dreams?
Um,

330
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:26,670
that doesn't necessarily mean I forget 
my dreams.

331
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,260
And what I mean by that is accessibility
versus availability.

332
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,540
So if you haven't had that experience 
where you've woken up,

333
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:37,800
you thought I was definitely dreaming,
I can't quite grab it.

334
00:16:37,801 --> 00:16:39,120
You know,
it just and it's gone.

335
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,460
And then two days later you're in the 
shower,

336
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,310
you sort of washing yourself,
you see a bottle of shampoo,

337
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:49,370
you see the label,
and it just triggers the unlocking of 

338
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:52,731
that dream memory and it sort of comes 
flooding back or someone says something 

339
00:16:52,731 --> 00:16:52,731
to you and you think,
oh,

340
00:16:52,731 --> 00:16:53,560
that was the dream.

341
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:58,800
What that tells me as a brain scientist 
is that the memory is there.

342
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,900
It's preserved,
it's available.

343
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:06,350
But what happens when most of the time 
when we wake up is that we lose the Ip 

344
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:08,160
address to the memory,
so it's present,

345
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:11,220
but it's not consciously accessible,
available,

346
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:14,130
not accessible.
If that's true,

347
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,160
what it means is that this type of 
information we know can have 

348
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,000
nonconscious impacts on our behavior all
the time.

349
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:25,050
It's great brain science about this 
nonconscious memory processing.

350
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:29,190
It's possible that we store every one of
our dreams.

351
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:33,210
We just don't consciously have 
accessibility to it.

352
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:36,120
But nevertheless it's changing how we 
behave,

353
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:40,200
how we feel each and every day.
No evidence for it to theory.

354
00:17:40,201 --> 00:17:43,320
I'm still wanting to test.
But that's possible too.

355
00:17:43,321 --> 00:17:45,630
And it's only that anecdote where I can 
think.

356
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,180
I just don't remember the dream.
I forgotten it.

357
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,040
I don't.
That may be true.

358
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,410
It may still be there.
I just need to find

359
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:56,590
keys to sort of access that memory.
What's stunning to me is how quickly the

360
00:17:56,591 --> 00:18:01,591
dream evaporates.
The memory of the dream or in relation 

361
00:18:01,591 --> 00:18:05,881
to an actual experience.
Like if we went outside and we saw some 

362
00:18:06,581 --> 00:18:08,800
lady walk up to some guy and kick him in
the balls,

363
00:18:08,801 --> 00:18:09,970
we'd be like,
whoa.

364
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:15,180
We would remember that and that you 
needed to be able to tell your friends 

365
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:15,180
like,
yeah,

366
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,750
some lady just randomly walked as some 
guy and kicked him in the balls.

367
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:21,930
Like we would remember that and you'd 
remember it 10 minutes later you'd 

368
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:22,470
member in an hour you'd remembered.
Yes.

369
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,700
Next day you'd be telling your friends.
Yeah,

370
00:18:24,701 --> 00:18:29,701
she just walked right up to him.
I remember it like it was yesterday 

371
00:18:29,701 --> 00:18:31,990
because it was right,
but a dream it can be 10 minutes ago and

372
00:18:31,991 --> 00:18:34,810
you wake up and dude it was King Kong 
and he was.

373
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:38,860
He was swinging from my ceiling and 
somehow or another they fit in the room,

374
00:18:38,861 --> 00:18:43,861
but the room got bigger and you have 
these crazy dreams and then 20 minutes 

375
00:18:43,861 --> 00:18:46,570
later you forget all of it.
Like what is happening there?

376
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:51,940
So one,
one current explanation is that the 

377
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:54,560
chemistry of the brain when you go into 
dream sleep is radically different.

378
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:59,620
Yeah.
So one of the chemicals called 

379
00:18:59,620 --> 00:18:59,860
noradrenaline in the brain,
which downstairs in the body it's sister

380
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:01,400
chemical,
is called adrenaline.

381
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:05,510
Noradrenaline actually plummets to the 
lowest level.

382
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:10,540
It's actually,
it's a stress chemical in the brain or 

383
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:10,540
to one of them that get shut off during 
dream sleep,

384
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
which has been.
If you're panicking like what if you 

385
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,000
fall off a building?
Well,

386
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,600
what's interesting is that that chemical
is low wealth.

387
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:21,800
You're having that dream,
but when you wake up from those and some

388
00:19:21,801 --> 00:19:26,801
people often wake up,
that's when you have the spike of 

389
00:19:26,801 --> 00:19:29,380
origin,
so it's still low when you're in dream 

390
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,961
sleep,
but there's another chemical that goes 

391
00:19:31,961 --> 00:19:32,030
in the opposite direction.
It's called acid tile.

392
00:19:32,031 --> 00:19:37,031
Coleen.
It's the chemical that is actually an 

393
00:19:37,031 --> 00:19:40,240
altered in Alzheimer's disease and these
two chemicals will change essentially 

394
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:45,191
the input output direction of 
information flow into the memory centers

395
00:19:45,471 --> 00:19:46,700
of the brain center.
Sense

396
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:49,490
excuse people take that as a nootropic 
they do.

397
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:52,970
Yeah.
That's actually an Alpha brain when when

398
00:19:52,971 --> 00:19:57,971
you take that,
it's has been clinically proven to 

399
00:19:57,971 --> 00:20:01,271
enhance memory,
especially verbal memory and 

400
00:20:01,271 --> 00:20:01,271
recollection of words and things like 
that.

401
00:20:01,271 --> 00:20:03,620
That's right.
So that's happening while your sleeping

402
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:05,150
well,
so you're in rem sleep,

403
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:11,170
but what may be happening,
our current model is if you sort of 

404
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:11,170
build these neural models to sort of 
mimic dreaming,

405
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:16,450
it may be that during dreaming it's 
principally about the outflow of 

406
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:20,801
information to generate dreams and in 
fact the chemical profile is 

407
00:20:20,801 --> 00:20:23,600
oppositional to input which is about 
saving.

408
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:28,900
So it's about sort of pumping out 
information rather than committing 

409
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:32,621
information.
And so when you come out of a dream 

410
00:20:32,621 --> 00:20:35,111
sleep,
you still get this sort of lingering 

411
00:20:35,111 --> 00:20:36,170
after sort of taste of chemistry as it 
were in the brain.

412
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:41,560
That means that the dreaming brain is 
more programmed to be outputting a 

413
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:45,830
narrative and an experience rather than 
actually committing it to memory,

414
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,800
which is the opposite direction.
That makes sense.

415
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:48,010
It

416
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,390
does make sense.
Um,

417
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,880
how aware are you of dimethyltryptamine?

418
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:55,360
I'm somewhat aware of it scientifically.
Not,

419
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,760
not,
not personally.

420
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:58,210
Yeah.
Yeah.

421
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:02,140
I'm one of the things about psychedelic 
experiences with dimethyltryptamine.

422
00:21:02,141 --> 00:21:03,790
First of all,
it's endogenous.

423
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:05,050
You,
your brain produces it,

424
00:21:05,051 --> 00:21:06,520
your lungs,
your liver produce it.

425
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:11,910
But when you have a dmt experience after
it's over,

426
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:17,450
the memory fades very rapidly and it 
seems just like a dream in that regard.

427
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:22,820
We're while while you're having it,
what's bizarre is that you're having it 

428
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:25,920
while you're awake and then after you 
have it within 10,

429
00:21:25,921 --> 00:21:30,921
20 minutes,
it is just like a dream that you can't 

430
00:21:30,921 --> 00:21:30,921
remember.
It's a very.

431
00:21:30,921 --> 00:21:34,490
I remember like little flashes of 
experiences that I've had and there's 

432
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:39,201
been a lot of speculation that that's 
one of the things that you're 

433
00:21:39,201 --> 00:21:41,630
experiencing while you're in heavy rem 
sleep and that could be responsible for 

434
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:44,190
the crazy visuals that you have.
That seemed so vivid.

435
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:49,580
I mean there's been times where I've had
dreams where I was 100 percent convinced

436
00:21:49,831 --> 00:21:52,830
that I was awake and then something 
happened.

437
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:55,560
Like I do this thing sometimes where 
I'll.

438
00:21:55,660 --> 00:22:00,660
If I do it consciously a lot.
I think I saw in one of those wacky 

439
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:04,611
movies like what the bleep do we know?
I think I saw it in that when you walk 

440
00:22:04,611 --> 00:22:06,660
up to a door,
as you're walking through the door,

441
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:09,120
you knock on the side of the door and 
go,

442
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:11,100
am I awake?
Nope,

443
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,780
not awake,
or am I asleep?

444
00:22:12,781 --> 00:22:13,520
Rather?
Yeah,

445
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:18,620
no,
I'm not asleep because I'm not going to 

446
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:18,620
the door.
Well,

447
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:21,141
I did that in my hand was just like 
going right through the wall and I'm 

448
00:22:21,141 --> 00:22:21,141
like,
oh,

449
00:22:21,141 --> 00:22:24,321
I'm sleeping.
And then I woke up and there was like 

450
00:22:24,321 --> 00:22:27,730
woo.
But the feeling that I had while I was 

451
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:29,250
in that dream,
it was so vivid.

452
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:34,430
I mean everything seemed so real.
Like what could possibly be causing me 

453
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:40,220
to construct this artificial reality in 
my mind that at the moment at least was 

454
00:22:40,741 --> 00:22:43,950
indistinguishable from the reality that 
experience right now.

455
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,230
And I'm assuming because I just knocked 
on the table that I'm awake.

456
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:52,290
Yeah.
I really hope I'm not just a fictive 

457
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:55,860
character in your dreams.
Maybe we're sharing a dream yet very 

458
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:55,860
inception,
like possible,

459
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:58,970
not based on the science so far.
Um,

460
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,650
but I think you know,
what you're speaking about,

461
00:23:02,651 --> 00:23:07,651
there really is almost why would,
why would mother nature create this 

462
00:23:07,651 --> 00:23:09,580
thing called the dream experience?
You know,

463
00:23:09,581 --> 00:23:14,581
what would be the function of 
essentially every night going into what 

464
00:23:14,651 --> 00:23:19,651
sums up to be about two total hours of 
virtual reality experience and testing.

465
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:26,580
One possibility which is deeply 
unsatisfying is that it's just a 

466
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:26,940
byproduct.
It's just Epi,

467
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:31,390
phenomenal that when your brain goes 
into this thing called rem sleep and all

468
00:23:31,391 --> 00:23:34,060
of the different patterns of brain 
activity that we described,

469
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:39,540
an offshoot is this thing that we call 
dreaming in the same way that a light 

470
00:23:39,701 --> 00:23:44,701
bulb,
the reason that we construct the 

471
00:23:44,701 --> 00:23:44,701
apparatus that's a light bulb is to 
produce light.

472
00:23:44,701 --> 00:23:46,850
But when you produce light in that way,
you also produce heat.

473
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:49,040
It was never the function of the light 
bulb.

474
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:54,070
It's just what happens when you produce 
light in that way may be dreaming is 

475
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:58,511
just sort of the heat of rem sleep and 
rem sleep serves lots of other 

476
00:23:58,511 --> 00:24:00,410
functions.
But wow,

477
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:04,340
that doesn't feel to me right though.
Why?

478
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:05,510
Well,
firstly,

479
00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:10,511
I think it's probably additionally 
metabolically demanding to have dreams 

480
00:24:10,511 --> 00:24:14,861
in addition to this thing called rem 
sleep and whenever mother nature burns 

481
00:24:14,861 --> 00:24:18,911
calories,
it's usually for a reason because 

482
00:24:18,911 --> 00:24:18,911
they're so precious.

483
00:24:18,911 --> 00:24:19,940
That's a good point.
That makes sense too.

484
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:25,370
Yeah.
I read some article about the lack of 

485
00:24:25,431 --> 00:24:29,120
rem sleep with marijuana users and it 
was trying to say,

486
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:31,580
and it made me super skeptical even as a
pot smoker,

487
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:37,250
it was trying to say that it's not bad 
for you because what it's essentially 

488
00:24:37,371 --> 00:24:42,371
doing is bypassing the rem sleep and 
going directly into the deep sleep and 

489
00:24:42,391 --> 00:24:45,230
then it's helping you in that regard.
Does that make sense to you?

490
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:48,170
It doesn't make sense as a 
neuroscientist.

491
00:24:48,171 --> 00:24:50,230
He says nay,
you fucking stoners.

492
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,610
Obviously.
I'm just so deeply unpopular,

493
00:24:52,611 --> 00:24:53,300
you know,
I'm telling you

494
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:57,070
don't smoke pot,
stay away from alcohol,

495
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:59,350
you know,
apart from a general personality,

496
00:24:59,351 --> 00:25:01,180
which is dislikable.
This doesn't help me.

497
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:03,790
Definitely not dislikable,
but I don't think you're saying anything

498
00:25:03,791 --> 00:25:04,920
wrong.
I think um,

499
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:10,500
I think marijuana,
like most things is best used in 

500
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:14,521
moderation.
And one thing that I got out of the 

501
00:25:14,521 --> 00:25:18,420
sober October thing wasn't just that.
It's fascinating to see the dreams,

502
00:25:18,731 --> 00:25:23,731
like just ramp up and get crazy.
But also that when you take a few days 

503
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:26,650
off and then smoke a little pot,
the pot actually has more of an impact.

504
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:32,040
In fact,
one of my favorite psychedelic authors 

505
00:25:32,291 --> 00:25:34,510
and lectures,
the late great Terence Mckenna,

506
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:39,840
his advice was to not do marijuana for 
long periods of time and then do as much

507
00:25:41,621 --> 00:25:44,800
as you could stand.
And he was a,

508
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:49,920
you know,
a real psychedelic adventure in his 

509
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,140
thought was to really get the benefit 
out of marijuana.

510
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:54,610
It's not something that should be used 
daily and recreate recreationally.

511
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,040
It should be used as a psychedelic 
sacrament.

512
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:02,430
Not should be because he actually did 
smell pot pretty rarely read pretty 

513
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:06,121
regularly rather.
But his thought was if you really want 

514
00:26:06,121 --> 00:26:08,290
to get the full impact of it,
you shouldn't be accustomed to it.

515
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:13,560
And when you're accustomed to it,
you build up a tolerance to it and it 

516
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,320
doesn't have the same impact.
Like it's that thing.

517
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:16,660
I don't know if you've ever been around 
pot smokers,

518
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,960
but when someone doesn't smoke pot and 
then they get talked into smoking pot 

519
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,810
with some pot smokers,
it's always a terrible idea.

520
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:28,620
You got a bunch of people with super 
high tolerances and some poor person 

521
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,530
that doesn't have any tolerance and they
just,

522
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:34,830
they just get taken down a tornado,
rabbit whole journey into their child,

523
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:40,220
zero to 60 and so paranoid and thinking 
about everything and freaking out all 

524
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:42,940
these sensations and they just never 
experienced before.

525
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:43,980
But,
uh,

526
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:48,930
the,
the idea that you could bypass rem sleep

527
00:26:48,931 --> 00:26:52,380
and go straight into the deep sleep,
that doesn't make any sense to you.

528
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:53,610
No,
it doesn't.

529
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:58,611
And what we've learned over the past 30 
or 40 years is all stages of sleep are 

530
00:26:59,101 --> 00:27:00,440
important.
You know,

531
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:05,250
when you think about sleep as a state,
it makes no sense.

532
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,390
You know,
first the,

533
00:27:06,391 --> 00:27:10,390
your vulnerable to predation.
You're not finding food,

534
00:27:10,391 --> 00:27:12,420
you're not finding a mate,
you're not reproducing,

535
00:27:12,421 --> 00:27:15,660
you're not caring for your young on any 
one of those grounds.

536
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:20,130
Sleep should have been strongly selected
against as a collective.

537
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,550
I mean it,
it's,

538
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:26,600
it's almost idiotic.
If sleep does not serve an absolutely 

539
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,630
vital function,
it is the biggest mistake,

540
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:32,650
the evolutionary process ever made,
and that counts for all of the stages of

541
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:35,220
sleep too.
Again,

542
00:27:35,221 --> 00:27:40,221
Mother Nature wouldn't waste time 
putting you into a state that wasn't 

543
00:27:40,221 --> 00:27:40,221
necessary.

544
00:27:40,221 --> 00:27:44,450
And what we've discovered is that all of
those different stages of sleep that we 

545
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:46,140
spoke about all have unique and separate
functions.

546
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,870
So you can't short change any one of 
them.

547
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:52,200
You don't need to bias towards one and 
try and sort of,

548
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:53,430
you know,
play Kate,

549
00:27:53,431 --> 00:27:54,960
the other,
you know,

550
00:27:55,530 --> 00:28:00,530
evolution is,
has taken a long time to get the 

551
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:02,280
blueprint accurately correct for each 
physiological individual.

552
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:06,150
I wouldn't play around with it and think
that you're smarter than that process.

553
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:12,330
When I read it,
I felt like it was a justification for 

554
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:12,330
smoking pot.
Like,

555
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:13,050
man,
you're just getting deeper sleep,

556
00:28:13,051 --> 00:28:15,030
man.
You don't need that rem sleep.

557
00:28:15,031 --> 00:28:16,530
You're passing it up,
man.

558
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:18,780
You just go right into the deep,
heavy,

559
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:20,170
necessary sleep.
Oh,

560
00:28:20,171 --> 00:28:23,340
contra contrary potheads.
Um,

561
00:28:23,341 --> 00:28:28,341
so what is happening to the body during 
rem sleep that's so critical that one 

562
00:28:29,221 --> 00:28:30,780
particular aspect of sleep.

563
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,230
So firstly,
in the body,

564
00:28:34,231 --> 00:28:38,580
the your cardiovascular system seems to 
do something quite strange.

565
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:43,820
It goes through periods of dramatic 
acceleration and then dramatic 

566
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,750
deceleration during,
during rem sleep.

567
00:28:45,751 --> 00:28:50,370
Quite unpredictable too.
We also know that during rem sleep,

568
00:28:50,371 --> 00:28:55,371
your brain power analyzes your body so 
that your mind can dream safely.

569
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:57,310
So wow,
I mean,

570
00:28:57,350 --> 00:29:00,990
and that makes a lot of sense.
If you're thinking that you're,

571
00:29:00,991 --> 00:29:05,991
you know,
this world champion mixed martial arts 

572
00:29:05,991 --> 00:29:06,600
person and it's in the middle of the 
night,

573
00:29:06,601 --> 00:29:07,890
you're not,
it's dark.

574
00:29:07,891 --> 00:29:10,200
You can't see.
You're not perceiving or outside world,

575
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:15,380
you're going to get popped out of the 
gene pool very quickly if you start 

576
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:18,351
acting out that experience.
So there is a barrier in place that 

577
00:29:18,351 --> 00:29:20,850
mother nature locks you down in 
incarceration,

578
00:29:20,851 --> 00:29:22,350
muscling,
customer coloration.

579
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:25,710
That's crazy that you say that because 
when I was fighting,

580
00:29:25,711 --> 00:29:28,500
when I was young,
I would wake up throwing kicks.

581
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:32,070
I would kick in the middle of the night.
I would do it all the time.

582
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:37,370
I'd be sleeping and I just,
I would move and throw a kick in the 

583
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:38,940
middle of the night and I remember 
waking me up like,

584
00:29:38,941 --> 00:29:42,160
what the fuck is wrong with me?
And then I to go back to sleep again.

585
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:47,080
But I was obviously dreaming about 
competing.

586
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:49,780
Do you actually remember this when you 
woke up,

587
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:54,840
did you remember dreaming at that point 
or did you just have no recollection of 

588
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,700
anything going on at that point?
I believe I had a recollection.

589
00:29:57,701 --> 00:30:01,000
It's been a long time,
but I believe I had a recollection.

590
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:06,460
I'm like,
I would be like in bed with my 

591
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:06,460
girlfriend would wake her up too,
you know,

592
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:09,640
because I just don't like.
I wouldn't throw a full kick but my body

593
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,230
would move.
Like I was going to,

594
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:16,440
you know,
like I would turn my hips and my leg 

595
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:16,440
would extend.
It was my body was,

596
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:16,840
it was I,
I've,

597
00:30:16,841 --> 00:30:20,320
I attributed to the,
the idea that it's so extreme,

598
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:25,350
like the activity of fighting is so 
extreme that my brain had kind of like 

599
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:31,300
hyper charged itself to compete at this 
very high level,

600
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:36,540
you know,
and that this was so unusual that it 

601
00:30:37,091 --> 00:30:42,091
was,
it was almost at red alert all the time 

602
00:30:42,091 --> 00:30:42,940
and maybe even trying to work out 
patterns while I was sleeping.

603
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:45,730
That's exactly the evidence that we have
now.

604
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:47,130
So for things like

605
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:51,840
skills or even rats running around a 
maze where they will learn specific sort

606
00:30:51,841 --> 00:30:56,640
of navigational pathways and even 
skilled motor movements.

607
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,840
What you can do is you can place these 
electrodes into census of the,

608
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:01,860
of the brain.
We,

609
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:04,350
we work in my sleep,
sleep center works on humans,

610
00:31:04,351 --> 00:31:09,351
but other people have done these studies
in rats and you implant electrodes and 

611
00:31:09,351 --> 00:31:12,840
you measure the brain cells firing as 
the rat is running around the maze.

612
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:16,200
And let's say that you can sort of play 
little tones for each brain cell.

613
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:19,560
So they're running around the maze and 
and you can listen to the brain cells to

614
00:31:19,561 --> 00:31:19,940
learning

615
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:22,330
the signature of that may so it goes,
but bup,

616
00:31:22,331 --> 00:31:22,570
bup,
bup,

617
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:22,960
bup,
bup,

618
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:23,400
bup,
bup,

619
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:23,940
bup,
bup,

620
00:31:23,941 --> 00:31:28,941
bup.
But what was amazing is that when you 

621
00:31:28,941 --> 00:31:29,860
let those rats sleep,
but you keep listening to the brain,

622
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:35,130
what you hear is as if the brain is 
actually an infected is it's replaying 

623
00:31:37,241 --> 00:31:42,241
the exact same sequence.
They memory sequence that it was 

624
00:31:42,241 --> 00:31:43,340
learning whilst it was awake,
it's replaying,

625
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:46,990
but at a speed that is 20 times faster.

626
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,750
So now we start to get into this 
inception.

627
00:31:50,751 --> 00:31:55,751
Weldon,
I don't mean to cause the scientific 

628
00:31:55,751 --> 00:31:55,751
data read that we're not sort of in that
territory,

629
00:31:55,751 --> 00:31:59,771
but you know that notion of time 
compression and time dilation that 

630
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:02,810
Christopher Nolan played so well within 
that movie.

631
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:08,050
We can see that at the level of brain 
cell firing in rats as they're learning 

632
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:08,900
these mazes.
And it comes back to what you're saying,

633
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:13,940
which is that the better that they 
reversed those skilled memories,

634
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:16,730
when you wake them up and test them the 
next day,

635
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:21,260
that predicts how much better they are.
In terms of their performance,

636
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:26,710
so it's not just that you learn,
you go to sleep and you replay and you 

637
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:27,140
hit the save button on these new 
memories.

638
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:31,010
You actually scoped out those memories 
and you improve them.

639
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,490
And we've done studies with motor skill 
learning critical for athletics,

640
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:39,560
performance and practice does not make 
perfect practice with a night

641
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:44,570
of sleep is what makes perfect because 
you come back the next day and you're 20

642
00:32:44,571 --> 00:32:49,571
to 30 percent better in terms of your 
skilled performance than where you were 

643
00:32:49,571 --> 00:32:51,740
at the end of your practice session the 
day before.

644
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:54,590
Wow.
Wow.

645
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:59,620
I mean sleep is the greatest legal 
performance enhancing drug that most 

646
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,040
people are probably neglecting in sport.

647
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:06,510
Wow.
And not just for your physical 

648
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:06,510
performance,
but actually skill learning.

649
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:06,960
That's right.
Skill learning,

650
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:08,820
memory.
And then also,

651
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:13,870
you know,
downstairs in the body all over the 

652
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:13,870
recuperative benefits.
Um,

653
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:17,480
and you can flip the coin by the way,
if you're getting six hours of sleep or 

654
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:21,111
less,
your time to physical exhaustion drops 

655
00:33:21,111 --> 00:33:24,651
by up to 30 percent.
So you could spend all of your time 

656
00:33:24,651 --> 00:33:27,810
training for 10 round fight,
perfect condition.

657
00:33:27,811 --> 00:33:30,270
But then I put you on six hours of sleep
the night before,

658
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:35,540
you're now going to be physically 
exhausted by round seven rather than 

659
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:35,540
around 10.

660
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:35,540
Wow.
But.

661
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:40,131
Well,
and that's a really hard thing for 

662
00:33:40,131 --> 00:33:40,131
fighters because they have a very 
difficult time sleeping the night before

663
00:33:40,131 --> 00:33:40,350
a big fight.
Yeah.

664
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:43,100
It's very,
very difficult because usually sit and.

665
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:47,700
Yep.
And I would imagine it's got to be.

666
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:50,230
I mean it's probably going to take a 
huge,

667
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:55,270
a huge tournament is probably be a huge 
benefit if they can somehow or another 

668
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:59,740
bypass all that and just relax and learn
how to relax and learn how to actually 

669
00:33:59,740 --> 00:33:59,740
sleep.

670
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:02,690
I mean it's,
I think it's one of constantly trying to

671
00:34:02,691 --> 00:34:07,691
hack the physiological system,
especially in elite sports these days 

672
00:34:07,691 --> 00:34:11,950
because you know,
small fractions of a percent of gain to 

673
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:11,950
make a huge difference.
So that sounds like 30 percent.

674
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:13,070
That's a monster.
Huge.

675
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:18,100
Yeah.
I mean your time to sort of not just 

676
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:18,100
physical exertion,
but you know,

677
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:21,940
the lactic acid builds up quicker.
The less and less that you sleep your 

678
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:25,010
ability of the lungs to actually expire.
Carbon dioxide inhale,

679
00:34:25,011 --> 00:34:28,070
oxygen decreases,
the less sleep that you have

680
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:30,140
so much sense.
Why?

681
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:35,180
Because when I was doing,
I was doing fear factor and I was doing 

682
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:38,381
standup comedy and then I was also doing
another television show and I was doing 

683
00:34:38,381 --> 00:34:39,170
Jujitsu.
I never got eight hours sleep.

684
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:44,380
I'm mostly got four,
usually go for it and my cardio is 

685
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:44,420
sucked.
It was terrible.

686
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:46,940
And I'd be like,
why is my cardio soccer workout so much?

687
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:49,150
Like that was probably what it was.
Yeah,

688
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:51,730
it's a huge part of that.
Now,

689
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:54,590
how many hours of sleep should you get?
Similar between?

690
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:57,770
It gives me somewhere between seven to 
nine hours.

691
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:00,620
Um,
once you get below seven hours of sleep,

692
00:35:00,621 --> 00:35:03,100
we can measure objective,
impermanent your

693
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:07,690
brain and your body.
I can show that in the last two days and

694
00:35:07,691 --> 00:35:10,990
I can show it because I basically did 
the same workout two days in a row.

695
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:16,250
Um,
the day before I had flown back from 

696
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:16,250
Boston,
very tired.

697
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:21,040
I'm hiring out with my kids all day.
Went to get some sleep,

698
00:35:21,041 --> 00:35:23,740
but then I had to do some stuff at like 
2:00

699
00:35:23,741 --> 00:35:25,360
in the morning.
And uh,

700
00:35:25,361 --> 00:35:30,361
I just never really got good sleep.
And then my youngest daughter got up at 

701
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:34,441
five,
she was crying and then eventually my 

702
00:35:34,441 --> 00:35:36,840
alarm went off at eight,
so my sleep was like three,

703
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:41,850
four hours.
It was all screwy and the night before 

704
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:42,450
it was even less because I had flown and
I had to get up early for the flight and

705
00:35:42,451 --> 00:35:45,840
I tried to sleep on the plane and I went
running and I felt like dog shit.

706
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,880
And then during the day I felt like dog 
shit,

707
00:35:47,881 --> 00:35:49,710
I just didn't have,
like as I was running,

708
00:35:49,711 --> 00:35:52,530
I just didn't have any extra gear.
I was like,

709
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:55,110
I did it,
I pushed through it,

710
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:56,340
but then it was over.
It was like,

711
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,020
oh,
well last night,

712
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,330
last night I slept seven and a half 
hours,

713
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:02,520
woke up today,
lifted weights,

714
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:03,960
ran,
ran,

715
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:05,640
felt great,
feel great.

716
00:36:05,641 --> 00:36:07,860
Now,
like two days in difference.

717
00:36:07,861 --> 00:36:08,790
I mean,
that's the difference.

718
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:10,800
The difference is one day I got real 
sleep.

719
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:14,850
One day I did and I did the exact same 
thing even more today I did,

720
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,280
I lifted weights today as well.
And I just feel great.

721
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:22,550
So I could see,
I could see it physiologically in the 

722
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:23,160
difference in my performance in 24 
hours.

723
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:23,470
Yeah,

724
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,740
and that's noticeable.
I mean we see that too.

725
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:26,730
You know,
your,

726
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:29,730
um,
your peak muscle strength,

727
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:34,170
your physical vertical jump height and 
your peak running speed,

728
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:36,510
all of those things correlate with 
sleep.

729
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:38,030
The less that you have,
the worst,

730
00:36:38,031 --> 00:36:41,430
those outcomes are probably one of the 
most surprising factors.

731
00:36:41,431 --> 00:36:46,431
There was injury risk when they've 
looked at athletes across a season and 

732
00:36:46,431 --> 00:36:50,391
they've just plotted how frequently will
they get injured and then they surveyed 

733
00:36:50,391 --> 00:36:50,391
them,
you know,

734
00:36:50,391 --> 00:36:55,040
how much sleep are you getting?
And they bucketed them into sort of 

735
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:55,040
people who are getting nine hours,
seven hours,

736
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:55,200
six,
five,

737
00:36:55,201 --> 00:36:58,140
four,
and it's a perfect linear relationship.

738
00:36:58,141 --> 00:37:01,380
The less sleep that you have hired your 
injury risk,

739
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:04,380
so people getting nine hours versus five
hours,

740
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:09,500
there was almost a 60 percent increase 
in probability of injury risk during a 

741
00:37:09,511 --> 00:37:10,740
season.
Do you attribute it

742
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:15,750
that to exhaustion or do you attribute 
that to a lack of recovery from the 

743
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:18,520
previous night's workout?
Is it a combination of those things?

744
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:23,790
Is it exhaustion causing you to miss 
step perhaps and like twist an ankle or 

745
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:24,190
turn a knee?

746
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,030
Yeah,
it's all of those things.

747
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:32,010
Even if you look at micro balance,
if you look at sort of the stability 

748
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:32,050
muscles versus you know,
major muscles,

749
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:36,400
those stability muscles also fail when 
you're not getting sufficient sleep.

750
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:40,480
And I think we often underestimate how 
critical they are in sport performance,

751
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:45,780
particularly in terms of combating and 
placating injury risk to see if you just

752
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:48,020
get someone on a stability ball,
you know,

753
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:51,130
sort of just dose them down with sleep 
eight hours,

754
00:37:51,131 --> 00:37:52,900
five hours,
three hours,

755
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:58,080
and just notice how those stability 
muscles help you balance just the basic 

756
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,130
act of balance that deteriorates 
dramatically.

757
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,550
No wonder you're getting more or injury

758
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:02,870
risk.
Totally makes sense.

759
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:07,200
Now as a neuroscientist,
what do you attribute when,

760
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:10,280
when,
when people talk about visualization and

761
00:38:10,281 --> 00:38:15,281
visualization is a,
it's a huge factor in improving 

762
00:38:15,281 --> 00:38:17,120
technical skills,
uh,

763
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:19,350
specifically more martial arts,
which is a,

764
00:38:19,351 --> 00:38:24,351
I'm a big fan of obviously martial arts.
When you visualize people who visualize,

765
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:30,080
who sit down and like go over their 
body,

766
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:32,540
going through the motions and doing 
things,

767
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:35,950
those people perform better,
they better,

768
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,410
they,
um,

769
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:39,400
they,
they learn quicker.

770
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:44,820
What do you attribute that to?
Do you think it's the same thing as 

771
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:45,760
what's happening when you're sleeping?
Just maybe to a lesser extent.

772
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:50,290
I think it's to a lesser extent,
but people have done those studies where

773
00:38:50,291 --> 00:38:53,890
they've looked at sort of whether you 
actually physically practice,

774
00:38:53,891 --> 00:38:58,891
let's say on a keyboard,
just because it's easier to sort of 

775
00:38:58,891 --> 00:39:01,620
managing the laboratory versus just 
imagining sort of typing out that 

776
00:39:02,051 --> 00:39:06,250
sequence and just the act of physical 
visualization,

777
00:39:06,251 --> 00:39:09,220
of sort of imagination of that motor 
skill.

778
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:14,950
It's about 50 percent as effective as 
physically performing it too,

779
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:20,130
and it's 50 percent as effective.
What I mean there is in changing the 

780
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:23,740
plastic connections within the brain to 
even just visualization,

781
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:28,910
know passive play as it were still can 
actually cause a rewiring of the brain 

782
00:39:30,461 --> 00:39:31,180
beneficially.

783
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:32,980
Wow.
You know,

784
00:39:32,981 --> 00:39:36,520
learning techniques,
specifically martial arts techniques.

785
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:38,650
My good friend,
Eddie Bravo,

786
00:39:38,651 --> 00:39:41,920
so world famous Jujitsu instructor,
he's,

787
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:47,010
he's always.
I'm comparing it to tying your shoe and 

788
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:51,751
he said,
do you know how like when you were a 

789
00:39:51,751 --> 00:39:51,760
little kid and you're trying to figure 
out how to tie your shoe,

790
00:39:51,761 --> 00:39:54,910
it's an extremely difficult thing to do.
Like how do I do this?

791
00:39:54,911 --> 00:39:59,911
And you put that down and you do loops.
Like I'm watching my seven year old 

792
00:39:59,911 --> 00:40:01,960
daughter go through that right now.
But now as a grown man,

793
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:03,700
when I tie my shoe,
I could just be talking to you.

794
00:40:03,701 --> 00:40:04,100
Oh,
what?

795
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:09,150
Oh yeah,
we're going to go tomorrow and I'll do 

796
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:09,150
it.
I don't.

797
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:11,211
I don't even know what I did.
If you tried to ask me to explain how I 

798
00:40:11,211 --> 00:40:11,260
tie my shoes,
I'd be like,

799
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:16,590
how do I tell her shit?
Like I don't even know how I do it 

800
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:16,590
because it just.
I have it in there.

801
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:19,840
It just it.
And the idea with martial arts is you've

802
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:24,870
got to be.
All of your techniques have to be 

803
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:25,990
automatic.
Someone extends the arm.

804
00:40:25,991 --> 00:40:27,830
You instantly hook it and go into the 
arm bar.

805
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:32,850
You know someone.
You have to have these paths like so 

806
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:35,230
drilled in that you don't even know 
you're doing them until it's over.

807
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:40,450
Yeah.
So automaticity is one of the things 

808
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:40,450
that sleep actually accomplishes.
Yeah.

809
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:45,320
I was talking about those 20 to 30 
percent benefits in motor skill 

810
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:48,671
performance.
So we did some additional studies to 

811
00:40:48,671 --> 00:40:48,671
actually say,
well what,

812
00:40:48,671 --> 00:40:49,220
how it,
how does sleep do that?

813
00:40:49,221 --> 00:40:51,500
You know,
where in your skill performance to sleep

814
00:40:51,501 --> 00:40:54,170
give you the benefit.
So you're right,

815
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:56,030
tying a shoelace,
you know,

816
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,500
even driving a car with stick,
you know,

817
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:03,510
at first it's just overwhelming.
It's so difficult to clutch it's gas 

818
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:03,570
pedal,
you know,

819
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:07,400
it's good and now it's just second 
nature.

820
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:12,520
You know,
it's shifted from conscious to 

821
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:12,520
automatic,
from conscious and unconscious.

822
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:16,910
If you look at performance that is 
conscious and not automatic,

823
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:19,280
it's usually very staccato.
It's this,

824
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:20,900
then it's that,
then it's that.

825
00:41:20,901 --> 00:41:25,901
It's not fluid.
If you heard someone trying to sort of 

826
00:41:25,901 --> 00:41:26,660
play piano to begin with,
doesn't sound very fluid.

827
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:29,420
You know,
as someone who is a maestro,

828
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:34,510
it just flows out of them.
So we looked at this with skill 

829
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:34,510
performance.
Again,

830
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:38,310
sort of a keyboard playing musicianship 
and you learn and you learn,

831
00:41:38,311 --> 00:41:41,490
you get better and let's see,
but you type a sequence that take four,

832
00:41:41,491 --> 00:41:41,880
one,
three,

833
00:41:41,881 --> 00:41:42,480
two,
four,

834
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:47,960
and people learn it,
but they have these problem points 

835
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:47,960
throughout the sequence.
They go four,

836
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:48,060
one,
three,

837
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:48,690
two,
four,

838
00:41:48,691 --> 00:41:49,290
four,
one,

839
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:50,250
three,
two,

840
00:41:50,251 --> 00:41:55,251
four as if it's as a sticking point to 
the same thing with any skilled 

841
00:41:55,251 --> 00:41:59,280
performance in an in athletics and it's 
the brain chunking things up.

842
00:41:59,281 --> 00:42:03,600
A very long motor sequence gets chunked 
up into small sort of digestible bites.

843
00:42:03,601 --> 00:42:08,601
It's a good way to begin learning,
but it's not a way to create 

844
00:42:08,601 --> 00:42:08,601
automaticity.
At some point.

845
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:13,670
What you have to do is stitch all of 
those things together and it just flows 

846
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:14,280
like a sentence,
like a sentence.

847
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:15,810
Yeah,
like a piano piece,

848
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,190
like a,
you know,

849
00:42:17,191 --> 00:42:19,260
a sequence of movements.
If you've got,

850
00:42:19,261 --> 00:42:20,640
you know,
in martial arts you've got.

851
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:26,520
So what we found was that before sleep,
you've got these big problem points,

852
00:42:26,521 --> 00:42:31,521
these gaps in your motor skill.
Learning sleep does not necessarily 

853
00:42:31,521 --> 00:42:32,760
improve the places where you're already 
good.

854
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:35,160
Sleep is intelligent.
It goes in,

855
00:42:35,161 --> 00:42:37,110
finds that problem,
point,

856
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:42,140
that friction point in your motor skill 
sort of deficit and it smooths it out.

857
00:42:42,661 --> 00:42:45,000
So you come back the next day and now 
it's just four,

858
00:42:45,001 --> 00:42:45,240
one,
three,

859
00:42:45,241 --> 00:42:45,600
two,
four,

860
00:42:45,601 --> 00:42:45,880
four,
one,

861
00:42:45,881 --> 00:42:46,140
three,
two,

862
00:42:46,141 --> 00:42:46,510
four,
four,

863
00:42:46,511 --> 00:42:51,511
three.
It's automaticity and it's exactly what 

864
00:42:51,511 --> 00:42:51,511
you're describing,
you know,

865
00:42:51,511 --> 00:42:52,050
speak to musicians.
They'll say,

866
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:54,900
I was playing,
I just couldn't get that piece the night

867
00:42:54,901 --> 00:42:59,901
before.
And then I came back the next day and I 

868
00:42:59,901 --> 00:43:01,120
sat down and I could just play,
sleeps doing its work.

869
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:05,230
I've heard that too with problems and 
that's why people say sleep on it.

870
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:06,790
Yeah.
Yeah.

871
00:43:06,791 --> 00:43:08,830
You've never been told to stay awake on 
a problem,

872
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:13,350
right?
I mean sometimes when you're about to go

873
00:43:13,351 --> 00:43:15,420
to bed,
it's almost overwhelming.

874
00:43:15,421 --> 00:43:17,220
You just can't concentrate on anything 
else,

875
00:43:17,221 --> 00:43:18,840
but this problem,
whatever it is.

876
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:21,180
And then you go to sleep and you wake up
in the morning like,

877
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:22,170
Eh,
that's all right.

878
00:43:22,570 --> 00:43:23,560
Yeah,
it's going to be fun.

879
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:24,700
Yeah,
I got it.

880
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,310
I know what to do.
And sleep.

881
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:31,430
So there's lots of anecdotal evidence of
sleep inspired creativity and now the 

882
00:43:31,751 --> 00:43:34,270
shift to one of the benefits of 
dreaming,

883
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:36,820
in fact,
it's during dream sleep,

884
00:43:36,821 --> 00:43:40,600
when we take all of the information that
we've previously learned and we start to

885
00:43:40,601 --> 00:43:44,170
collide it with all of the new 
information that we've learned.

886
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:49,380
It's um,
I mean it's a little bit like group 

887
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:49,380
therapy for memories,
you know,

888
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:52,630
everyone gets a name badge and you will 
get to speak to each other and the brain

889
00:43:52,631 --> 00:43:57,580
starts to seek out and test novel 
connections and new associations.

890
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:03,130
So it's almost like informational 
alchemy and you wake up the next morning

891
00:44:03,131 --> 00:44:08,131
with a revised mind wide web that is now
capable of dividing,

892
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:13,380
you know,
incredible solutions to previously 

893
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:16,310
impenetrable problems.
And lots of anecdotes.

894
00:44:16,311 --> 00:44:21,311
You know,
Dmitri Mendeleev came up with the 

895
00:44:21,311 --> 00:44:21,560
periodic table of elements by way of 
dream in spite insight,

896
00:44:21,561 --> 00:44:23,960
you know,
talk about a Herculean task.

897
00:44:24,110 --> 00:44:29,110
Take all of the elements in the known 
universe and figure out a structure as 

898
00:44:29,110 --> 00:44:29,810
to how they all fit together.
Off you go,

899
00:44:30,410 --> 00:44:31,980
his waking could not do

900
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:34,440
it.
His sleeping brain solved the problem.

901
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,990
And Einstein,
by the way,

902
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:43,320
this is Einstein was suggested to be a 
short sleeper and we don't know if 

903
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:45,000
that's true,
but even if he was,

904
00:44:45,090 --> 00:44:50,090
he was a habitual Napa during the day.
I've got some great pictures of him on 

905
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:54,471
his work bench and he used sleep 
ruthlessly as a tool for creativity and 

906
00:44:57,121 --> 00:45:00,960
he would sit at his desk and he would 
have a sort of pad of paper and a pencil

907
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:06,590
and he had a chair with arm rests and he
would pick up two steel ball bearings 

908
00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:11,180
and take a metal saucepan and turn it 
upside down,

909
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:15,730
placed underneath the arm of the chair 
and put the tool,

910
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:21,110
steel ball bearings in his hand and he 
would rest back and he would start to 

911
00:45:21,110 --> 00:45:22,350
fall asleep and so we didn't fall too 
far into sleep.

912
00:45:22,351 --> 00:45:25,440
What would happen is at some point his 
muscle tone would relax.

913
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:27,330
They would release the steel ball 
bearings.

914
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:29,610
They would crash on the Saucepan,
wake him up,

915
00:45:29,850 --> 00:45:33,080
and then he would write down all of the 
creative ideas that he was.

916
00:45:33,081 --> 00:45:36,510
Half isn't the half really in no one 
day.

917
00:45:36,511 --> 00:45:41,511
Yeah.
You're never told to sort of stay awake 

918
00:45:41,511 --> 00:45:41,511
and a problem,
and in every language that I've inquired

919
00:45:41,511 --> 00:45:42,990
about today,
I'm French Swahili.

920
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:46,260
That phrase,
sleeping on a problem seems to exist,

921
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:51,680
which must mean that this benefit of 
dream sleep transcends cultural 

922
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,280
boundaries.
I should note.

923
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:57,870
I think it's important that the French,
the French translation is much closer to

924
00:45:57,871 --> 00:45:59,490
you.
You sleep with a problem.

925
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:00,390
We,
the British,

926
00:46:00,391 --> 00:46:02,070
you say you sleep on a problem,
the French,

927
00:46:02,071 --> 00:46:07,071
you say you sleep with a problem.
I think it says so much about the 

928
00:46:07,071 --> 00:46:08,430
romantic difference between the British 
and the French.

929
00:46:08,431 --> 00:46:10,350
You know the Fed is trying to fuck 
everything.

930
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:13,410
Fuck their problems.
No British passport,

931
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:18,870
but I won't either.
It's just a joke.

932
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:21,810
That's fascinating that Einstein figured
that out too,

933
00:46:21,811 --> 00:46:26,811
that he literally had like a,
a whole routine that you had dropped 

934
00:46:26,811 --> 00:46:31,601
this ball and hit it bearing and wake up
and start writing like south will have 

935
00:46:31,601 --> 00:46:33,000
to be in the room watching Einstein to 
that.

936
00:46:33,001 --> 00:46:34,650
It must have been fascinating.
I'm sorry.

937
00:46:34,651 --> 00:46:36,270
I said Einstein.
Edison.

938
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:42,330
I'm an idiot at changes everything.
That's probably the best medicine.

939
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:44,790
A thief though.
Didn't he steal everything from Tesla?

940
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:49,560
I think there's an argument to be made,
but I mean he has a lot to answer for by

941
00:46:49,561 --> 00:46:51,510
the way,
in terms of the way that we're sleeping,

942
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:52,650
you know,
he electric,

943
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,840
he was the first person to electrify 
society,

944
00:46:55,140 --> 00:47:00,140
not necessarily create the light bulb,
but he really gave shifted us from a 

945
00:47:01,231 --> 00:47:06,231
point where now we controlled the night 
in terms of illumination and we are a 

946
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:11,900
dark deprived society in this modern era
and that's one of the things that are 

947
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:12,570
keeping us awake at night.
A lack of darkness.

948
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:17,750
You're not just that,
but also our inability to see the stars 

949
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:20,661
anymore.
The light pollution that we have at 

950
00:47:20,661 --> 00:47:20,661
night.
I think it's,

951
00:47:20,661 --> 00:47:21,450
I think it's a giant shift in 
perspective.

952
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:22,400
Like,
uh,

953
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:26,430
have you ever,
you ever been to a planetarium or.

954
00:47:26,431 --> 00:47:28,350
I'm an observatory,
like one of those,

955
00:47:28,351 --> 00:47:29,440
uh,
at night

956
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:34,570
there's a Keck observatory in Hawaii as 
a place I try to go to every year.

957
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:39,750
And it's,
it's really stunning because it's very 

958
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:43,621
high up.
I think the observatory is somewhat 

959
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:46,570
somewhere more than 9,000
feet above sea level.

960
00:47:46,571 --> 00:47:49,630
And then I think you go even further and
then they have the telescopes,

961
00:47:49,631 --> 00:47:52,180
but you go to visit our center and you 
go to the visitor center.

962
00:47:52,181 --> 00:47:56,680
They have some telescope set up,
but it's huge actually drive through the

963
00:47:56,681 --> 00:47:59,500
clouds.
So as you're driving up this mountain,

964
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:00,490
we were bummed out.
We're like,

965
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:01,240
oh,
it's cloudy.

966
00:48:01,241 --> 00:48:06,241
We might not be able to see anything.
And then you drive through the clouds 

967
00:48:06,241 --> 00:48:06,241
and then we need to get through the 
clouds.

968
00:48:06,241 --> 00:48:06,700
You're like,
Holy Shit.

969
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:10,990
And you feel like you're on a spaceship 
flying through space.

970
00:48:10,991 --> 00:48:15,991
And this is what our ancestors saw every
night when they went to sleep with a 

971
00:48:15,991 --> 00:48:17,230
clear sky,
they saw all the stars.

972
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:21,130
They saw the full milky way like this.
And the way the big island has set up,

973
00:48:21,131 --> 00:48:25,540
they use diffused lighting all over the 
island because of the Keck observatory.

974
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:30,720
So you don't have the same level of 
light pollution that you have when 

975
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,170
you're in a normal city like Los 
Angeles,

976
00:48:32,470 --> 00:48:33,880
which is terrible.
I mean the La,

977
00:48:33,881 --> 00:48:36,760
if you look up you see like one or two 
stars because everything's lit up.

978
00:48:36,850 --> 00:48:40,540
It's crazy bright that I think that 
perspective is,

979
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:45,600
that's a giant factor in the way human 
beings look at their relationship with 

980
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:50,161
the universe,
but I think that also just the light 

981
00:48:50,161 --> 00:48:50,710
everywhere,
constant light everywhere.

982
00:48:51,090 --> 00:48:53,890
It's got to be a big factor in why 
people sleep so little,

983
00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:54,430
right?
Yep.

984
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:55,690
We know it is now.
I mean,

985
00:48:55,691 --> 00:48:59,500
these studies have been done.
The first part is the external light,

986
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:00,220
which is,
you know,

987
00:49:00,221 --> 00:49:01,610
street lighting,
you know,

988
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:04,240
even if you've got curtains that can 
still bleed through,

989
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:08,920
but then when you come into the home,
know the invasion of light into the home

990
00:49:08,921 --> 00:49:11,200
by way of technology has been a big 
problem.

991
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:12,940
People are looking at their phones 
before they go to,

992
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:18,120
well first of the year,
I mean the incandescent light bulb sort 

993
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:21,301
of was the start of it and light bulbs 
can suppress a hormone that's called 

994
00:49:21,301 --> 00:49:25,651
Melatonin is the hormone of darkness and
it tells your brain when it's dark and 

995
00:49:25,651 --> 00:49:29,521
when it's time to sleep,
but then you add into that screen usage 

996
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:31,900
and they've done studies where,
for example,

997
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:32,920
um,
you know,

998
00:49:32,921 --> 00:49:37,120
one hour of ipad reading versus just one
hour of reading on a book,

999
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:38,440
you know,
in dim light,

1000
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:44,010
that one hour of ipad reading firstly 
delayed the release of this critical 

1001
00:49:44,291 --> 00:49:47,140
darkness hormone called Melatonin by 
about three hours.

1002
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:50,590
So if you read on your ipad for an hour 
here in California,

1003
00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:53,530
your Melatonin peak is not going to 
arrive.

1004
00:49:53,531 --> 00:49:55,120
I mean somewhere in Hawaii time,
in fact,

1005
00:49:55,121 --> 00:49:56,630
it's three hours delayed.
Wow.

1006
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:00,400
It's 50 percent less in terms of its 
peak.

1007
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:05,700
And furthermore,
you don't get the same amount of rem 

1008
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:05,700
sleep and when you wake up the next 
morning,

1009
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:07,990
you don't feel refreshed or restored by 
your sleep.

1010
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:12,850
Those studies have been done to wow,
what should someone do

1011
00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:19,170
if they have a hard time sleeping?
Like say if you're a person who has 

1012
00:50:19,170 --> 00:50:19,750
insomnia,
you have a hard time getting,

1013
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:22,330
getting to bed and you have a hard time 
staying asleep.

1014
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:24,550
When you wake up,
you can't go back to bed.

1015
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:26,080
Are there other strategies?

1016
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:27,260
There are.
I mean,

1017
00:50:27,470 --> 00:50:31,460
I think for most people that are five 
things that you can do just out the gate

1018
00:50:31,610 --> 00:50:36,610
to get better sleep regularity is 
probably the most important thing I can 

1019
00:50:36,610 --> 00:50:36,950
tell you.
Go to bed at the same time,

1020
00:50:36,951 --> 00:50:40,100
wake up at the same time,
no matter whether it's the weekend.

1021
00:50:40,101 --> 00:50:44,420
Weekday regularity is key.
We've spoken about light.

1022
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:47,360
For example,
when you in the last hour before bed,

1023
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:52,480
tried to stay away from screens but also
just switch off half the lights in the 

1024
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,650
house.
You'd be surprised at how soporific that

1025
00:50:54,651 --> 00:50:59,651
is.
It really starts to sort of make you 

1026
00:50:59,651 --> 00:51:02,201
feel a bit more drowsy.
They done some great studies where they 

1027
00:51:02,201 --> 00:51:04,220
would take people out into the rockies,
no electric light,

1028
00:51:04,221 --> 00:51:09,221
no electricity whatsoever,
and they started to go to bed two hours 

1029
00:51:09,221 --> 00:51:13,570
earlier than the acclaimed natural 
bedtime wasn't just because they didn't 

1030
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:14,330
have anything necessarily to do.

1031
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:17,250
It was that their Melatonin was rising,
you know,

1032
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:20,030
two hours earlier.
So keep it dark.

1033
00:51:20,570 --> 00:51:25,570
The third is probably keep it cool.
Your brain actually needs to drop its 

1034
00:51:25,570 --> 00:51:29,030
temperature by about two to three 
degrees Fahrenheit to initiate sleep.

1035
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:35,320
And that's the reason that you will 
always find it easier to fall asleep in 

1036
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:38,240
a room that's too cold than too hot.
I've seen people use cold pads.

1037
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,490
Casinos,
are you sleep on these cold pads?

1038
00:51:40,491 --> 00:51:41,780
What do you think of those?
Yeah,

1039
00:51:41,810 --> 00:51:45,470
I mean the evidence is pretty good that 
cooling the body actually works.

1040
00:51:45,471 --> 00:51:46,560
They've,
um,

1041
00:51:46,610 --> 00:51:51,610
you know,
in the book I write about a series of 

1042
00:51:51,610 --> 00:51:52,460
studies where they had people in it.
It's almost like a wet suit,

1043
00:51:52,850 --> 00:51:55,760
but it has all of these veins running 
through it.

1044
00:51:56,270 --> 00:52:01,270
And they could actually perfuse warm or 
cold water into any part of the body,

1045
00:52:02,001 --> 00:52:04,370
hands core of the body,
feet,

1046
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:10,150
and so you could exquisitely manipulate 
the temperature of any part of the body 

1047
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:15,700
and what they found is that they could 
effectively cool the body down and it 

1048
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:20,410
instantaneously made people fall asleep 
faster and it gave them deeper,

1049
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:21,830
deep,
non rem sleep,

1050
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:26,860
that sort of restorative sleep for the 
body so you can even look at studies 

1051
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:31,751
where people sleep semi naked and that 
also seems to improve their sleep and 

1052
00:52:31,941 --> 00:52:33,770
they get a little bit more deep sleep 
too.

1053
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:39,460
So cold is better.
The paradox here though is that you need

1054
00:52:39,561 --> 00:52:44,561
to warm your feet and your hands to kind
of charm the blood away from your core 

1055
00:52:45,230 --> 00:52:47,900
out to the surface and radiate that 
heat.

1056
00:52:48,390 --> 00:52:50,870
Really should go to sleep with socks and
gloves on.

1057
00:52:50,871 --> 00:52:52,070
Yeah.
Or better.

1058
00:52:52,071 --> 00:52:56,030
Still have a hot bath and evidence here 
to that.

1059
00:52:56,031 --> 00:52:58,340
I discussed where people say,
you know,

1060
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:03,341
I get out of a hot bath.
I feel nice and toasty and relaxed and 

1061
00:53:03,341 --> 00:53:03,500
that's why I fall asleep.
It's the opposite.

1062
00:53:03,950 --> 00:53:07,370
When you get into a bath,
you get vasodilation,

1063
00:53:07,670 --> 00:53:09,890
all you sort of get rosy cheeks,
red skin,

1064
00:53:10,130 --> 00:53:15,130
all of the blood rushes to the surface.
You get out of the bath and you have 

1065
00:53:15,130 --> 00:53:18,860
this massive thermal dump of heat that 
just evacuated from the body.

1066
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:23,030
Your core body temperature plummets,
and that's why you sleep better,

1067
00:53:23,031 --> 00:53:24,740
so you can hack the system very easily.

1068
00:53:25,050 --> 00:53:30,050
Wow.
So your core body temperature plummets 

1069
00:53:30,050 --> 00:53:31,200
and that's what makes you sleep easier.
Yeah,

1070
00:53:31,770 --> 00:53:36,770
that sounds so counterintuitive,
but it makes sense and it makes sense 

1071
00:53:36,770 --> 00:53:41,420
because that's how we were designed.
If you look at hunter gatherer tribes 

1072
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:42,810
whose way of life has not changed for 
thousands of years in you,

1073
00:53:42,930 --> 00:53:47,930
how do they sleep?
One of the things that seems to dictate 

1074
00:53:47,930 --> 00:53:50,550
the sleep is the rise and fall of 
temperature.

1075
00:53:50,710 --> 00:53:54,360
Your temperature is at it's lowest in 
the Nadeer of the night,

1076
00:53:54,361 --> 00:53:55,620
you know,
three or four in the morning.

1077
00:53:55,950 --> 00:53:59,310
And as that temperature that climate 
temperature starts to drop,

1078
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:03,780
that's when they start to get drowsy as 
if temperature is just sort of signaling

1079
00:54:03,781 --> 00:54:05,910
to the brain.
Now it's time to sleep.

1080
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:08,460
So light as well as temperature.
Uh,

1081
00:54:08,461 --> 00:54:11,580
two key triggers to help you get better 
sleep.

1082
00:54:12,630 --> 00:54:14,880
If you look at those tribes,
by the way,

1083
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:16,890
and when they go to sleep and they wake 
up,

1084
00:54:17,670 --> 00:54:20,490
they go to sleep probably at two hours 
after dusk,

1085
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:25,580
sort of eight to nine in the evening,
wake up about half an hour or even an 

1086
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:25,580
hour before dawn.

1087
00:54:25,590 --> 00:54:28,230
It's the rise in temperature rather than
light.

1088
00:54:28,231 --> 00:54:32,100
That triggers their awakening.
But there's a reason,

1089
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:37,160
you know,
have you ever thought about what the 

1090
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:39,471
term midnight actually means middle of 
the night and that's what it should be 

1091
00:54:40,741 --> 00:54:45,741
for all of us.
But in modernity we've been dislocated 

1092
00:54:45,741 --> 00:54:49,761
from our natural rhythms and now 
midnight has become the time when we 

1093
00:54:49,761 --> 00:54:50,460
think I should check facebook last time,
you know,

1094
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:53,550
I should send my last email.
That wasn't.

1095
00:54:53,551 --> 00:54:58,551
That is not how we were designed to 
sleep and in fact we may also be 

1096
00:54:58,551 --> 00:55:01,860
designed to sleep by physically too.
If you look at those hunter gatherers,

1097
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:05,010
they don't sleep one long bout of eight 
hours at night.

1098
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:10,040
Yeah.
I've heard this recently that people 

1099
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:11,100
that you should have two sleeps.
The idea of two sleeps.

1100
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:16,220
Yeah.
It's actually a little different than 

1101
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:17,871
the idea of to sleep,
so there was a time in sort of the 

1102
00:55:17,871 --> 00:55:20,670
Dickensian era where people would sleep 
for the first half of the night,

1103
00:55:20,671 --> 00:55:22,410
may be sort of four hours or so.

1104
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:25,200
Then they would wake up,
they would socialize,

1105
00:55:25,201 --> 00:55:27,240
they would eat,
they would make love,

1106
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:29,400
and then they would go back and have a 
second sleep.

1107
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:34,080
If you look at natural biological 
rhythms in the brain and the body,

1108
00:55:34,110 --> 00:55:36,480
that doesn't really seem to be how we 
were designed.

1109
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:40,110
It certainly seems to be something that 
we did in society,

1110
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:45,320
but I think it's more of a societal 
trend than it was a biological edict.

1111
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:51,800
However,
we do seem to have to sleep periods the 

1112
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:55,161
way that we were designed.
Those tribes will often sleep about six 

1113
00:55:55,161 --> 00:55:55,740
and a half hours,
seven hours of sleep at night,

1114
00:55:56,340 --> 00:56:01,340
and then especially in the summer,
they'll have that Siesta like behavior 

1115
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:04,371
in the afternoon and all of us have that
sort of this what's called the 

1116
00:56:04,371 --> 00:56:09,051
postprandial dip in alertness just means
after lunch and if I measure your brain 

1117
00:56:09,801 --> 00:56:14,801
wave activity with electrodes,
I can see a drop in your physiological 

1118
00:56:14,801 --> 00:56:17,640
alertness somewhere between two to 4:00
PM in the afternoon,

1119
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:20,430
but it's that dependent on diet.
It's not.

1120
00:56:20,431 --> 00:56:21,600
People think it is.
You know,

1121
00:56:21,601 --> 00:56:23,470
especially after they've had a heavy 
lunch.

1122
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:29,070
You can actually just have people fast 
and sort of well fasting for long 

1123
00:56:29,070 --> 00:56:30,100
periods of time actually makes you sleep
much worse,

1124
00:56:30,130 --> 00:56:34,210
but you can have people abstain from 
lunch and you still get that drop,

1125
00:56:34,211 --> 00:56:37,300
so it's independent food.
It's a genetically hardwired,

1126
00:56:37,330 --> 00:56:42,330
preprogrammed drop that suggest we 
should be sleeping by physically but 

1127
00:56:42,330 --> 00:56:43,720
does is that dependent upon their 
standard diet?

1128
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:46,240
Because if,
if someone is on a carbohydrate,

1129
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:47,890
carbohydrate,
rich diet,

1130
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:51,330
a lot of times you do get that spike and
then you crash crash.

1131
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:54,220
What?
When people are on low carb and high fat

1132
00:56:54,221 --> 00:56:56,400
diets,
they don't get that and they,

1133
00:56:56,401 --> 00:57:01,401
they,
they tend to be more even with their 

1134
00:57:01,401 --> 00:57:01,401
energy through the day.
Yeah.

1135
00:57:01,401 --> 00:57:04,410
So yeah,
that sort of more constant release of 

1136
00:57:04,410 --> 00:57:06,391
energy can actually help you sort of 
almost combat that lo without lo exists 

1137
00:57:06,391 --> 00:57:08,140
no matter what exactly.
So even if you don't think it exists,

1138
00:57:08,141 --> 00:57:08,560
it's there.

1139
00:57:08,590 --> 00:57:09,880
It's still present.
Interesting.

1140
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:12,880
So why did they do that and then the 
Dickens era,

1141
00:57:12,881 --> 00:57:17,881
why did they,
what is there a root cause of their 

1142
00:57:17,881 --> 00:57:18,880
double sleep thing?
We don't know.

1143
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,340
I mean,
it's hard to sort of really fascinating.

1144
00:57:21,370 --> 00:57:22,000
Yeah,
it's a,

1145
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:23,110
a trend.
Yeah.

1146
00:57:23,111 --> 00:57:25,930
That it was a movement.
So they would just wake up and do things

1147
00:57:25,931 --> 00:57:30,931
and yeah,
maybe it's because they didn't have tv 

1148
00:57:30,931 --> 00:57:31,530
and what to do with themselves.
Yeah,

1149
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:34,720
sounds like they did some pretty 
interesting things,

1150
00:57:34,721 --> 00:57:35,650
which are nice,
but yeah.

1151
00:57:35,651 --> 00:57:40,651
Yeah.
Well they created a lot of art then to 

1152
00:57:40,651 --> 00:57:40,660
write a lot of writing and a lot of 
fascinating stuff came out of that time.

1153
00:57:40,930 --> 00:57:42,150
Now when you're,
um,

1154
00:57:42,350 --> 00:57:47,350
when you're measuring a people's health 
and when you're measuring people's 

1155
00:57:47,471 --> 00:57:49,720
health in regard to how much sleep they 
have,

1156
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,490
like what,
how do you,

1157
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:52,150
how do you do that?

1158
00:57:52,150 --> 00:57:55,270
Do you just talk to people?
Do you do surveys?

1159
00:57:55,271 --> 00:58:00,271
Like how do you get like a detailed 
analysis of people's patterns so you can

1160
00:58:00,671 --> 00:58:04,480
do it at many different levels.
I mean we can start at the sort of gross

1161
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:09,481
high level,
which is epidemiological studies across 

1162
00:58:09,481 --> 00:58:12,001
millions of people where you do surveys,
you ask them about their sleep and then 

1163
00:58:12,001 --> 00:58:16,231
you look at health outcomes.
The first thing from that data that's 

1164
00:58:16,231 --> 00:58:18,040
clear is an unfortunate truth.
The shorter your sleep,

1165
00:58:18,041 --> 00:58:19,940
the shorter your life.
Well,

1166
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:22,690
short sleep predict all caused 
mortality,

1167
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:26,260
which is really ironic because people 
that want to sleep less.

1168
00:58:26,530 --> 00:58:27,370
I like,
you know,

1169
00:58:27,371 --> 00:58:29,290
I don't have a whole lot of time.
You know,

1170
00:58:29,291 --> 00:58:30,740
this life is short.
Yeah.

1171
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:32,750
Fucking shorter if you sleep less.
Yeah.

1172
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:34,130
That old maximum,
you know,

1173
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:35,370
you can sleep when you're dead.
Yeah.

1174
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:38,110
Well,
it's mortally and wise advice because we

1175
00:58:38,111 --> 00:58:43,111
know from the data you will be both dead
sooner and the quality of that now 

1176
00:58:43,111 --> 00:58:44,020
shorter life will be significantly 
worse.

1177
00:58:44,290 --> 00:58:46,660
Yeah.
That's counterintuitive to people.

1178
00:58:47,010 --> 00:58:52,010
The idea that you need this,
it's not just like you're making best 

1179
00:58:52,691 --> 00:58:55,000
use of time by sleeping less,
you're not.

1180
00:58:55,330 --> 00:58:58,480
You'd make best use of time by being 
awake less.

1181
00:58:58,540 --> 00:59:00,160
Exactly.
Which is crazy.

1182
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:05,340
I mean wakefulness firstly from a brain 
perspective is a low level of brain 

1183
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:06,250
damage.
We know that wakefulness is low.

1184
00:59:06,370 --> 00:59:09,280
Like right now where you and I are 
getting low level brain damage.

1185
00:59:09,281 --> 00:59:10,000
Yeah,
that's right.

1186
00:59:10,060 --> 00:59:12,240
I need sleep.
That officer reparatory function.

1187
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:12,880
Wow.
And,

1188
00:59:13,070 --> 00:59:14,590
and you know,
I'll give you one example,

1189
00:59:14,591 --> 00:59:16,390
which is your risk for Alzheimer's 
disease,

1190
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:21,600
insufficient sleep across the lifespan 
now seems to be one of the most 

1191
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:22,010
significant lifestyle factors.
Determining

1192
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:23,780
whether or not you'll develop 
Alzheimer's,

1193
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:27,830
what studies or if any have been done on
people that work third shift.

1194
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:31,970
So people have looked at shift work in 
general.

1195
00:59:32,450 --> 00:59:35,690
They haven't necessarily split it down 
to that granular point,

1196
00:59:36,050 --> 00:59:40,340
but what we see is that shift workers 
have higher rates of obesity,

1197
00:59:40,341 --> 00:59:45,341
high rates of diabetes,
but perhaps most frighteningly cancer 

1198
00:59:45,341 --> 00:59:49,960
and in fact we now know the link between
a lack of sleep and cancer is quite 

1199
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:54,491
strong.
Insufficient sleep is linked to cancer 

1200
00:59:54,491 --> 00:59:54,491
of the bowel,
cancer of the prostate,

1201
00:59:54,491 --> 00:59:58,511
cancer of the breast,
and the association has become so 

1202
00:59:58,511 --> 01:00:01,841
powerful that recently the World Health 
Organization decided to classify any 

1203
01:00:01,841 --> 01:00:04,430
form of nighttime shift work as a 
probable carcinogen.

1204
01:00:04,790 --> 01:00:06,440
Wow.
Yeah,

1205
01:00:06,441 --> 01:00:11,441
so jobs that may induce cancer because 
of a disruption of your sleep wake 

1206
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:11,441
rhythms.

1207
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:16,250
Are there other correlating factors like
don't people that sleep less or work 

1208
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:18,450
into the night,
don't they eat more,

1209
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:21,300
more shitty food?
They do both of those things.

1210
01:00:21,301 --> 01:00:23,460
Yeah,
and we know exactly the pathway,

1211
01:00:23,461 --> 01:00:27,960
so there are two hormones that control 
your appetite and your weight.

1212
01:00:28,390 --> 01:00:33,390
I'm one is called Leptin.
The other is called Ghrelin and they 

1213
01:00:33,390 --> 01:00:33,390
sound like hobbits,
but

1214
01:00:33,390 --> 01:00:34,280
they're not the real.
They're real.

1215
01:00:34,860 --> 01:00:37,650
The real chemicals.
It's bizarre,

1216
01:00:37,651 --> 01:00:38,870
but 10

1217
01:00:38,870 --> 01:00:42,850
is the chemical that tells your brain 
you're full,

1218
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:45,760
you're satiated.
You don't want to eat anymore.

1219
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:49,010
Grelin does the opposite.
It's the hunger hormone.

1220
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:52,730
It says you want to eat more,
you're not satisfied with your food.

1221
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:55,520
If I take people in,
these studies have been done.

1222
01:00:55,521 --> 01:01:00,521
We've done some of these studies too,
and you just put you a group of healthy 

1223
01:01:00,521 --> 01:01:03,200
people on four or five hours of sleep 
for let's see one week,

1224
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:08,740
and you look at those two hormones.
They go and in fortunately opposite 

1225
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:12,311
directions,
so leptin that says you're full stop 

1226
01:01:12,311 --> 01:01:12,920
eating.
That gets suppressed by lack of sleep.

1227
01:01:13,070 --> 01:01:16,160
Ghrelin,
the hunger hormone that gets ramped up.

1228
01:01:16,790 --> 01:01:20,810
So first the people who are sleeping 
just five to six hours a night,

1229
01:01:20,811 --> 01:01:25,811
will on average eat somewhere between 
200 to 300 extra calories each day 

1230
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:30,020
because of the under slept state.
Add that up.

1231
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:32,600
It's about 70,000
extra calories a year.

1232
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:35,450
It's about 10 to 15 pounds of obese mass
each year.

1233
01:01:35,451 --> 01:01:38,120
Which for me is starting to sound 
familiar.

1234
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:43,460
Um,
but what we also know is that it's not 

1235
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:43,700
just that when you're under slept,
you eat more,

1236
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:49,240
you eat more of the wrong things.
So if these great scientific work,

1237
01:01:49,910 --> 01:01:54,910
if you give people this sort of finger 
buffet and they can eat whatever they 

1238
01:01:54,910 --> 01:01:58,961
want and it contains all of the 
different food groups and you sleep 

1239
01:01:58,961 --> 01:01:59,750
deprive them or you give them a full 
eight hours of sleep,

1240
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:05,500
yes,
they start to overeat by somewhere 

1241
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:06,200
around about 450 calories with total 
sleep deprivation,

1242
01:02:06,650 --> 01:02:11,120
but what they go after is heavy hitting 
carbohydrates and simple sugars,

1243
01:02:11,150 --> 01:02:14,960
processed food,
and they stay away from the healthy sort

1244
01:02:14,961 --> 01:02:16,640
of leafy Greens,
nuts,

1245
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:17,930
proteins,
etc.

1246
01:02:18,470 --> 01:02:23,470
So you're not eating more,
you're eating more of the wrong things 

1247
01:02:23,470 --> 01:02:26,840
and that's why a lack of sleep has such 
a strong obesogenic profile to it and 

1248
01:02:28,021 --> 01:02:29,760
you can take a step back to when you 
say,

1249
01:02:29,761 --> 01:02:34,761
well,
if you look at the rise of obesity of 

1250
01:02:34,761 --> 01:02:37,311
the past 70 years,
it's just this upward exponential 

1251
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:37,311
increase.

1252
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:41,180
And if you plot on the Same graph,
the amount of sleep that society is 

1253
01:02:41,180 --> 01:02:42,690
getting,
it goes in the opposite direction.

1254
01:02:42,691 --> 01:02:45,870
Asleep time is declined.
Obesity rates have increased.

1255
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:51,800
I'm not going to sit here and tell you 
that the obesity epidemic is simply a 

1256
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:51,800
sleep problem.
It's not,

1257
01:02:52,170 --> 01:02:55,560
it's a problem of as being sedentary 
process foods,

1258
01:02:55,590 --> 01:02:57,120
larger food,
serving sizes.

1259
01:02:57,690 --> 01:03:00,780
If you take those factors though by 
themselves,

1260
01:03:00,781 --> 01:03:04,640
they cannot explain the increase in 
obesity.

1261
01:03:04,710 --> 01:03:08,670
Other things are at play.
Is sleep one of them now we know it is.

1262
01:03:08,671 --> 01:03:10,620
It's a critical factor in the 
obesogenic,

1263
01:03:10,690 --> 01:03:11,340
a epidemic.

1264
01:03:11,610 --> 01:03:13,770
I know from personal experience when I'm
tired,

1265
01:03:13,771 --> 01:03:15,960
I always gravitate towards the worst 
choices.

1266
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:18,210
It's for me,
it's late night cheeseburgers,

1267
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:20,850
wednesdays at 2:00
in the morning or whatever.

1268
01:03:21,750 --> 01:03:25,580
What happens if you get naps,
like save.

1269
01:03:25,590 --> 01:03:30,590
You only have five hours of sleep,
but you take a two hour nap during the 

1270
01:03:30,590 --> 01:03:30,590
day.
Does everything make up?

1271
01:03:32,140 --> 01:03:37,140
Yes and no.
So what you're talking about there is 

1272
01:03:37,140 --> 01:03:39,900
what we call prophylactic napping,
which has sort of strategically trying 

1273
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:44,611
to help combat your deficiency of sleep.
Naps can actually give you benefits.

1274
01:03:45,011 --> 01:03:47,920
we've done some of these studies where 
they improve your learning,

1275
01:03:47,921 --> 01:03:49,240
your memory,
your alertness,

1276
01:03:49,241 --> 01:03:54,241
your concentration,
especially your emotional regulation to 

1277
01:03:54,241 --> 01:03:56,650
sleep is critical for emotional first 
aid and mental health.

1278
01:03:57,430 --> 01:04:02,430
However,
you can't keep using naps to self 

1279
01:04:02,430 --> 01:04:03,310
medicate,
sort of short sleep.

1280
01:04:03,311 --> 01:04:05,680
Have you know,
four or five hours each night?

1281
01:04:06,180 --> 01:04:08,590
Um,
we know that the system itself,

1282
01:04:08,591 --> 01:04:12,460
your,
your brain has no capacity to regain all

1283
01:04:12,461 --> 01:04:13,660
of the sleep,
but it's lost.

1284
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:16,150
It will try to sleep back some of that 
debt.

1285
01:04:16,510 --> 01:04:18,670
But what we've discovered,
let's say I take you tonight,

1286
01:04:18,820 --> 01:04:23,820
I deprive you of sleep eight hours last,
then I give you all of the recovery 

1287
01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:25,030
sleep that you want on a second,
third,

1288
01:04:25,031 --> 01:04:25,810
or fourth night.

1289
01:04:26,050 --> 01:04:31,050
you will sleep longer,
but you will only get back maybe just a 

1290
01:04:31,050 --> 01:04:33,280
three or four hours of that lost total 
eight.

1291
01:04:34,030 --> 01:04:39,030
So sleep is not like the bank.
You can't accumulate a debt and then 

1292
01:04:39,030 --> 01:04:43,411
hope to pay it off at the weekend.
And so there is no credit system within 

1293
01:04:44,381 --> 01:04:46,300
the brain for sleep.
You can't bank it,

1294
01:04:46,930 --> 01:04:50,260
which is odd by the way.
I would love that system,

1295
01:04:50,490 --> 01:04:55,490
you know?
Then you would know what road you would 

1296
01:04:55,490 --> 01:04:55,490
know,
what you owed,

1297
01:04:55,490 --> 01:04:58,590
but I could also just know when I'm 
going into a state of sleep debt and I 

1298
01:04:58,590 --> 01:05:01,210
could build up some credit and there's 
precedent for this.

1299
01:05:01,211 --> 01:05:06,211
By the way,
there is a system like that in the 

1300
01:05:06,211 --> 01:05:09,211
brain,
it's called the fat cell because there 

1301
01:05:09,211 --> 01:05:12,121
were times during our evolutionary past 
where we faced famine and we faced feast

1302
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:16,180
and so the body learned to adapt to that
and said,

1303
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:21,240
when you have store it up as caloric 
energy in these things called adipose 

1304
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:21,820
cells,
fat cells,

1305
01:05:22,090 --> 01:05:25,120
and then when you go into famine,
you can spend that caloric credit.

1306
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:28,240
Where is that in the brain?
Why don't we have that?

1307
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:33,600
The reason is very simple.
Human beings are the only species that 

1308
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:35,350
deliberately deprive themselves of sleep
for no apparent reason.

1309
01:05:36,220 --> 01:05:41,220
in other words,
mother nature has never faced the 

1310
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:43,660
challenge of coming up with a safety net
for lack of sleep.

1311
01:05:44,470 --> 01:05:46,840
We've never been forced to come up with 
that solution.

1312
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:49,990
That's why we get such demonstrably 
disease,

1313
01:05:49,991 --> 01:05:52,450
sickness and impermanent.
When you undergo a lack of sleep.

1314
01:05:52,690 --> 01:05:55,570
So this is a recent occurrence and in 
human beings,

1315
01:05:55,571 --> 01:05:56,500
is that what you're saying?
Yeah,

1316
01:05:56,560 --> 01:06:01,560
I mean the.
The only time we see it in nature is 

1317
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:02,380
when you go into conditions of 
starvation.

1318
01:06:02,381 --> 01:06:06,880
The only way that you can get a species 
to sleep less and it's very,

1319
01:06:06,881 --> 01:06:11,881
very difficult to do because sleep is 
just so essential is when you put them 

1320
01:06:11,881 --> 01:06:14,050
under conditions of extreme starvation 
there,

1321
01:06:14,051 --> 01:06:19,051
they will forego some sleep to stay 
awake so that they forage in a larger 

1322
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:22,900
sort of circumference area to try and 
find more food.

1323
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:25,900
It's probably the reason that when 
people go into fasting there,

1324
01:06:25,901 --> 01:06:30,901
sleep is so terrible because the brain 
is receiving this ancient trigger that 

1325
01:06:32,230 --> 01:06:34,360
you're going without food.
You're in state of salvation.

1326
01:06:34,361 --> 01:06:36,160
You need to stay awake and hunt for 
food.

1327
01:06:36,310 --> 01:06:38,470
That's why your sleep gets so much worse
when you're.

1328
01:06:38,710 --> 01:06:41,680
When you're undergoing fasting.
That's fascinating.

1329
01:06:41,770 --> 01:06:46,770
I did not know that.
So fasting is when you're talking about 

1330
01:06:46,770 --> 01:06:50,221
multiple day fast and you're not 
intermittent fasting and we don't know 

1331
01:06:50,221 --> 01:06:51,660
the evidence for intimate and fasting.
So you know,

1332
01:06:51,661 --> 01:06:53,890
if some people are doing sort of 12 
hours,

1333
01:06:53,891 --> 01:06:55,360
14 hours,
16 hours,

1334
01:06:56,380 --> 01:07:01,090
that that doesn't seem to be extreme 
enough to trigger a change in sleep.

1335
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:03,350
But if you fast for these long periods,
you know,

1336
01:07:03,430 --> 01:07:04,570
two days,
three days,

1337
01:07:04,571 --> 01:07:09,571
four days,
you can really see some quite marked 

1338
01:07:09,571 --> 01:07:09,571
sleep fragmentation,
sleepest,

1339
01:07:09,571 --> 01:07:11,140
ask any of those people,
they'll tell you.

1340
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:15,400
That's fascinating because people always
cite the health benefits of multiple day

1341
01:07:15,401 --> 01:07:20,401
fast.
Do you think that that's just like a 

1342
01:07:20,401 --> 01:07:20,401
placebo effect?
Um,

1343
01:07:20,410 --> 01:07:25,410
I mean,
certainly we know that there are 

1344
01:07:25,410 --> 01:07:27,240
chemical pathways that when you go into 
fasting are activated that seem to be 

1345
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:31,471
beneficial for health outcomes.
There's a big literature on sort of 

1346
01:07:31,471 --> 01:07:33,400
fasting and aging with the mtor pathway,
for example.

1347
01:07:33,850 --> 01:07:36,660
But you know,
we also know that as a species we're,

1348
01:07:36,670 --> 01:07:39,730
we were not designed to have such 
terrible fragmented sleep.

1349
01:07:39,940 --> 01:07:42,910
And we spoke about how sleep regulates 
your appetite.

1350
01:07:43,190 --> 01:07:48,190
You know,
if you're trying not to eat food and 

1351
01:07:48,190 --> 01:07:50,380
sort of control and manage your weight,
the last thing that you probably want to

1352
01:07:50,381 --> 01:07:55,240
do is be shortchanging yourself on sleep
because it's only going to make you even

1353
01:07:55,241 --> 01:07:57,910
more hungry and reach for sort of worse 
food.

1354
01:07:57,911 --> 01:08:01,240
So I still think there's room for 
fasting in the equation,

1355
01:08:01,241 --> 01:08:05,350
but I think was extreme fasts and the 
havoc that it plays on sleep,

1356
01:08:05,590 --> 01:08:10,590
it's still yet to be understood.
You've got to be very careful with 

1357
01:08:10,590 --> 01:08:11,230
playing around with anything going 
beyond sensible,

1358
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:12,070
you know,
behavior.

1359
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:14,430
So what does it like?
What is saved?

1360
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:15,830
You're going to fast for two days.

1361
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:21,010
What switches on that forces your body 
into this haphazard sleep program.

1362
01:08:22,070 --> 01:08:26,180
So that's where that whole moon 
gruelling just kicks into high gear.

1363
01:08:26,181 --> 01:08:30,680
That hormone that is just saying it's a 
starvation hormone at that point.

1364
01:08:30,681 --> 01:08:35,681
It's not just a hunger hormone,
you've gone over into starvation and 

1365
01:08:35,681 --> 01:08:39,491
that will promote a wa alertness.
It promotes chemicals that try to keep 

1366
01:08:39,491 --> 01:08:40,970
you awake.
Chemicals like dopamine to sort of force

1367
01:08:40,971 --> 01:08:43,610
you wide awake.
So it's forcing you to go hunter gather.

1368
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:44,500
That's right.
Yeah.

1369
01:08:46,010 --> 01:08:50,360
And this is even if your body goes into 
a state of ketosis that we don't know,

1370
01:08:50,570 --> 01:08:52,780
people have not tried to correlate sort 
of,

1371
01:08:52,830 --> 01:08:57,830
you know,
the profile change in ketosis versus 

1372
01:08:57,830 --> 01:09:01,091
alterations in sleep.
I actually think it would be 

1373
01:09:01,091 --> 01:09:01,091
fascinating,
you know,

1374
01:09:01,091 --> 01:09:03,620
maybe there's a peak where it's bad and 
then you sort of,

1375
01:09:03,621 --> 01:09:06,200
you crest it and then things get better,
you know,

1376
01:09:06,201 --> 01:09:07,820
just the body acclimate to that.

1377
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:13,060
I don't know,
it's w we've never seen the body being 

1378
01:09:13,060 --> 01:09:15,350
able to sort of re engage with,
you know,

1379
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:19,550
cognitive function with a dose of sleep 
deprivation that keeps going.

1380
01:09:19,551 --> 01:09:21,520
So if I am,
it's the tcp intern,

1381
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:24,710
take people and give them two weeks of 
seven hours of sleep,

1382
01:09:24,830 --> 01:09:27,680
five hours of sleep,
three hours of sleep or no sleep,

1383
01:09:28,740 --> 01:09:33,740
you know,
even by sort of seven days or even 14 

1384
01:09:33,740 --> 01:09:37,871
days of six hours of sleep,
your cognitive performance just 

1385
01:09:37,871 --> 01:09:41,320
nosedives like a dart into the ground 
and it doesn't show any signs of 

1386
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:44,540
leveling off as if there is no asymptote
that it could keep going.

1387
01:09:45,100 --> 01:09:50,100
And by the way,
people should know that after 20 hours 

1388
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:53,411
of being awake,
you are as impaired cognitively as you 

1389
01:09:53,411 --> 01:09:54,350
would be if you were legally drunk.
Wow.

1390
01:09:54,351 --> 01:09:56,420
WhAt about physical movement?
Same thing.

1391
01:09:56,540 --> 01:09:58,730
Yeah.
Integrity of your alertness and reaction

1392
01:09:58,731 --> 01:09:58,940
time.

1393
01:09:59,150 --> 01:10:00,770
But it's worse.
And this is where,

1394
01:10:00,970 --> 01:10:05,970
you know,
drowsy driving comes in for every 30 

1395
01:10:05,970 --> 01:10:08,441
seconds that we've been speaking,
there has been a car accident linked to 

1396
01:10:08,441 --> 01:10:10,130
sleeplessness,
drowsy driving,

1397
01:10:10,131 --> 01:10:15,020
it seems kills more people on the roads 
than either alcohol or drugs combined.

1398
01:10:15,470 --> 01:10:17,000
Whoa.
Why are.

1399
01:10:17,180 --> 01:10:20,480
Why are drowsy driving accident so 
deathly rail?

1400
01:10:20,540 --> 01:10:22,550
Now I'm not endorsing those other 
things.

1401
01:10:22,551 --> 01:10:27,551
Of course not,
but let's just think about why that's 

1402
01:10:27,551 --> 01:10:27,551
the case.
When you're under slept,

1403
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:30,290
you start to have what are called micro 
sleeps.

1404
01:10:31,250 --> 01:10:33,690
Sometimes your eyelid does not close all
the way.

1405
01:10:33,691 --> 01:10:38,691
It just partially closes,
but the brain essentially goes to sleep 

1406
01:10:38,691 --> 01:10:43,001
for just a very brief period of time.
You can even see individual brain cells 

1407
01:10:43,001 --> 01:10:44,570
looks like they go to sleep during these
micro sleeps.

1408
01:10:45,230 --> 01:10:50,230
at that moment.
If you're traveling in a vehicle on the 

1409
01:10:50,230 --> 01:10:51,590
freeway,
you've got a one ton misael traveling at

1410
01:10:51,591 --> 01:10:56,240
65 miles an hour and no one is in 
control one time if you're lucky.

1411
01:10:56,310 --> 01:10:57,310
Yeah,
yeah,

1412
01:10:57,560 --> 01:10:59,540
exactly.
Last time you saw a 2000 pound car,

1413
01:10:59,541 --> 01:11:00,940
unless you have a miata.
Yeah.

1414
01:11:01,790 --> 01:11:02,670
Yeah.
Or yeah,

1415
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:04,530
a mclaren p one.
But you know,

1416
01:11:04,620 --> 01:11:09,620
if you are,
even though they're having a are they 

1417
01:11:09,620 --> 01:11:09,620
really shows my lack of knowledge 
despite living with them.

1418
01:11:10,540 --> 01:11:15,540
You know,
I think what happens here is that when 

1419
01:11:15,540 --> 01:11:18,920
with drugs and alcohol,
it's often the case of a problem of 

1420
01:11:18,990 --> 01:11:22,290
later reaction with,
with a lack of sleep.

1421
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:26,280
It's a problem of no reaction at all.
So you're out of it so you're out of it.

1422
01:11:26,281 --> 01:11:30,330
So rather than breaking too late,
there's just no breaking whatsoever.

1423
01:11:30,350 --> 01:11:35,350
That's my tip for people too.
If you find yourself cole or tired and 

1424
01:11:35,350 --> 01:11:40,311
driving and you have to stay awake,
take a either ice or ice cold water and 

1425
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:44,390
put it in a wash cloth and then rub your
face with it.

1426
01:11:44,750 --> 01:11:45,350
It keeps you awake.

1427
01:11:45,390 --> 01:11:46,200
Works.
Yeah,

1428
01:11:46,201 --> 01:11:46,800
it works.
I mean,

1429
01:11:46,801 --> 01:11:48,630
if you're forced to drive for whatever 
reason,

1430
01:11:48,631 --> 01:11:49,430
you have to,
you know,

1431
01:11:49,460 --> 01:11:51,450
you have 20 minutes to go and you're 
really exhausted.

1432
01:11:51,810 --> 01:11:53,580
Do that,
I guess is the best.

1433
01:11:53,581 --> 01:11:58,581
Take a like a wet cloth.
Put ice inside of it and just rub your 

1434
01:11:58,581 --> 01:12:02,301
face.
It just wakes you right up for whatever 

1435
01:12:02,301 --> 01:12:02,301
reason.
And it's,

1436
01:12:02,301 --> 01:12:02,310
I mean,
those statistics around driving,

1437
01:12:02,340 --> 01:12:03,550
drowsy driving,
you know,

1438
01:12:03,580 --> 01:12:08,580
a frightening,
and it's a weird thing when you're on 

1439
01:12:08,580 --> 01:12:08,580
the road,
you're,

1440
01:12:08,580 --> 01:12:12,170
there's something about those white 
lines that just want to put you to 

1441
01:12:12,170 --> 01:12:14,991
sleep.
There's no other time where I feel more 

1442
01:12:14,991 --> 01:12:14,991
compelled to just conk out while I'm 
awake.

1443
01:12:14,991 --> 01:12:17,370
Yet it's probably one of the greatest 
sedatives known to men.

1444
01:12:17,990 --> 01:12:19,480
If that monotonous,
you know,

1445
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:24,500
behavior.
And the longer you go with that 

1446
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:24,500
monotony,
the worst things get.

1447
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:24,840
Um,
you know,

1448
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:26,280
and if you look at,
um,

1449
01:12:26,310 --> 01:12:27,420
you know,
teenagers,

1450
01:12:27,630 --> 01:12:31,050
that's where we see some of the greatest
impact of drowsy driving.

1451
01:12:31,170 --> 01:12:36,170
You know,
it's the leading cause of death in most 

1452
01:12:36,170 --> 01:12:36,170
first world nations.
Suicide is second.

1453
01:12:36,170 --> 01:12:36,540
Um,
wow.

1454
01:12:36,541 --> 01:12:38,090
ThAt is crazy.
It speaks to this,

1455
01:12:38,091 --> 01:12:40,530
you know,
this muddle of later school start times,

1456
01:12:40,531 --> 01:12:43,080
they've done these studies.
There was a great one that was done,

1457
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:48,500
I think in tenent county in Wyoming.
They shifted their school start times 

1458
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:49,920
from 7:35
in the morning to 8:55

1459
01:12:49,921 --> 01:12:54,921
in the morning,
much more biologically reasonable 

1460
01:12:54,921 --> 01:12:57,111
fatigue ages.
The only thing more impressive than the 

1461
01:12:57,111 --> 01:12:59,520
extra hour of sleep that those teenagers
reported getting was the drop in vehicle

1462
01:12:59,521 --> 01:13:04,521
accidents.
There was a 70 percent reduction in car 

1463
01:13:04,521 --> 01:13:05,570
crashes the following year when they 
made that sentence zero,

1464
01:13:05,580 --> 01:13:08,910
zero search.
The advent of abs technology,

1465
01:13:08,911 --> 01:13:13,911
for example,
antilock brake systems that dropped 

1466
01:13:13,911 --> 01:13:14,460
accident rates by 20 to 25 percent.
Some deemed it to be a revolution.

1467
01:13:14,700 --> 01:13:19,700
Here's a simple biological factor.
Sleep that will drop accident rates by 

1468
01:13:19,700 --> 01:13:20,520
70 percent.

1469
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:25,980
WOw.
So I think if our goal as educators 

1470
01:13:25,980 --> 01:13:29,240
truly is to educate and we spoken about 
learning and memory and not risk lives 

1471
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:34,041
in the process than we are failing our 
children in the most spectacular manner 

1472
01:13:34,041 --> 01:13:35,850
with this incessant model of early 
school start times.

1473
01:13:36,150 --> 01:13:41,150
Why do we do that?
Or not just really school times but 

1474
01:13:41,150 --> 01:13:44,510
early work times two.
I was driving to the airport the other 

1475
01:13:44,510 --> 01:13:44,510
day at 6:00
AM,

1476
01:13:44,510 --> 01:13:44,730
6:00
AM,

1477
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:46,800
bumper to bumper traffic on the four,
oh five.

1478
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:48,210
I was like,
this is insane.

1479
01:13:48,211 --> 01:13:50,250
Look at these poor fucks.
What are we doing?

1480
01:13:50,251 --> 01:13:52,770
and if you're in the car at 6:00
AM there,

1481
01:13:52,950 --> 01:13:55,410
it means that you probably woke up,
you know,

1482
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:59,220
five or 4:30
average school start times,

1483
01:13:59,221 --> 01:13:59,810
you know,
in the us,

1484
01:13:59,820 --> 01:14:00,630
some of them,
you know,

1485
01:14:00,660 --> 01:14:01,530
seven,
seven,

1486
01:14:01,531 --> 01:14:06,531
25 buses for school start time of seven,
25 will begin leaving at 5:30

1487
01:14:07,891 --> 01:14:08,340
in the morning.

1488
01:14:08,460 --> 01:14:10,470
That means that some kids are having to 
wake up at five,

1489
01:14:10,471 --> 01:14:11,440
15,
5:00,

1490
01:14:11,441 --> 01:14:14,050
maybe even earlier.
It's just lunacy.

1491
01:14:14,110 --> 01:14:15,070
It is lunacy.
Now,

1492
01:14:15,071 --> 01:14:16,090
why did they do that?
I mean,

1493
01:14:16,091 --> 01:14:19,070
it's just a pattern that they've always 
done and they don't,

1494
01:14:19,230 --> 01:14:22,180
they never corrected it again.
It's a pen that actually has,

1495
01:14:22,260 --> 01:14:24,730
has changed over the past 30 or 40 
years.

1496
01:14:24,731 --> 01:14:26,710
I mean,
american schools used to go to.

1497
01:14:26,740 --> 01:14:31,740
I'm used to start around 9:00
and it started to shift ever and ever 

1498
01:14:31,740 --> 01:14:35,820
earlier.
Why I'm part of it is because of work 

1499
01:14:35,820 --> 01:14:38,230
times that parents had to get to work at
ever earlier.

1500
01:14:39,390 --> 01:14:40,330
Chart the kid.
Yeah.

1501
01:14:40,630 --> 01:14:45,630
And then bus unions and schools,
they comply to that same timeframe as 

1502
01:14:45,630 --> 01:14:47,350
well.
And it becomes very difficult,

1503
01:14:47,380 --> 01:14:47,980
you know.
And um,

1504
01:14:48,490 --> 01:14:51,520
I don't mean to chest eyes,
school systems or the bus unions,

1505
01:14:51,521 --> 01:14:56,521
you know,
it's an incredibly difficult logistics 

1506
01:14:56,521 --> 01:14:56,830
problem,
but I have to think that,

1507
01:14:56,860 --> 01:14:58,660
you know,
what is our goal here,

1508
01:14:58,710 --> 01:15:03,710
if our goal is to keep our kids safe and
to get them well educated and get 

1509
01:15:03,710 --> 01:15:06,871
information into the brain and nurture 
them and create them to be the next 

1510
01:15:06,871 --> 01:15:10,411
generation early school,
start times on not the thing to do.

1511
01:15:11,020 --> 01:15:13,630
Um,
there's a lot of lazy kids out there.

1512
01:15:13,631 --> 01:15:14,830
They're going,
yes,

1513
01:15:15,370 --> 01:15:16,810
well pre john,
dr.

1514
01:15:16,970 --> 01:15:18,490
Preach.
I mean the data,

1515
01:15:18,491 --> 01:15:23,491
you know,
they looked at these academic things 

1516
01:15:23,491 --> 01:15:23,491
too,
you know,

1517
01:15:23,491 --> 01:15:25,440
one of these,
another example comes from edina in 

1518
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:26,540
Minnesota and they shifted school start 
times from a,

1519
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:31,560
I think it was seven slash 25 to 8:30
in the morning and they looked at sat 

1520
01:15:32,411 --> 01:15:37,411
scores and in the year before they made 
the time to change the top 10 percent 

1521
01:15:37,411 --> 01:15:41,500
performing students got an average sat 
score of 1,288,

1522
01:15:41,650 --> 01:15:46,650
which is a great school.
The following year when they were going 

1523
01:15:46,650 --> 01:15:47,740
to school now at 8:30
rather than 7:25,

1524
01:15:47,980 --> 01:15:52,980
the average sat score was 1,500.
That's a 212 point increase,

1525
01:15:55,330 --> 01:15:57,550
which is nontrivial.
Wow.

1526
01:15:57,760 --> 01:15:58,880
That's gigantic.
Yeah.

1527
01:15:59,860 --> 01:16:01,000
Yeah.
I just,

1528
01:16:01,270 --> 01:16:06,270
yeah.
I think it's the school time in 

1529
01:16:06,270 --> 01:16:06,270
correlation with the work time.
Yeah.

1530
01:16:06,270 --> 01:16:06,820
It's very difficult to get people off of
that.

1531
01:16:07,020 --> 01:16:08,740
Yeah,
and that's part of what,

1532
01:16:08,850 --> 01:16:13,850
you know,
modernity has done where we're working 

1533
01:16:13,850 --> 01:16:16,660
longer hours and also we're commuting 
for longer durations of time,

1534
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:19,600
so therefore people having to wake up 
earlier,

1535
01:16:19,601 --> 01:16:24,601
they come home later and the one thing 
that gets squeezed sort of like vice 

1536
01:16:24,881 --> 01:16:27,670
grips is this thing called sleep,
you know,

1537
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:33,000
and the decimation of sleep throughout 
industrialized nations as a 

1538
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:36,511
consequences.
Having a catastrophic impact on our 

1539
01:16:36,511 --> 01:16:37,330
health and our wellness and the safety 
and the education of our children.

1540
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:39,910
Silence.
Sleepless epidemic.

1541
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:42,220
Wow.
Now,

1542
01:16:42,460 --> 01:16:47,460
other than I'm making the room cold and 
warming up your hands and your feet and 

1543
01:16:48,401 --> 01:16:50,950
things along those lines.
What about diet?

1544
01:16:51,020 --> 01:16:56,020
Is it or even time that you eat,
is there a specific time before you go 

1545
01:16:56,081 --> 01:17:01,081
to bed that you should eat?
How much time should you give yourself 

1546
01:17:01,081 --> 01:17:02,140
the digestive food?
So the general advice right now is don't

1547
01:17:02,141 --> 01:17:05,680
go to bed too full and don't go to bed 
too hungry again,

1548
01:17:05,681 --> 01:17:08,470
if you're going to bed too hungry,
you can get that sort of,

1549
01:17:08,670 --> 01:17:13,670
that signal of I'm starting to go into 
low level sort of starvation and that 

1550
01:17:13,670 --> 01:17:14,600
can keep people awake at night.

1551
01:17:15,540 --> 01:17:20,540
Um,
the evIdence in terms of diet 

1552
01:17:20,540 --> 01:17:22,721
composition and sleep is quite unclear.
It's not particularly well researched 

1553
01:17:22,721 --> 01:17:26,441
area right now.
What we do know is that diets that are 

1554
01:17:26,441 --> 01:17:29,770
high in sugar,
and I'm sort of heavier starchy 

1555
01:17:30,081 --> 01:17:35,081
carbohydrates and low in fiber,
those diets tend not to be good for 

1556
01:17:35,081 --> 01:17:39,911
sleep.
You tend to have less deep sleep and 

1557
01:17:39,911 --> 01:17:40,250
your sleep is also more fragmented 
throughout the night.

1558
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:45,560
Um,
so that's sort of right now the best 

1559
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:48,041
advice.
So usually several hours before you go 

1560
01:17:48,041 --> 01:17:48,590
to bed,
but not five hours.

1561
01:17:48,770 --> 01:17:49,530
That's right.
Yeah,

1562
01:17:49,660 --> 01:17:54,660
like two hours maybe.
And it's different for different people 

1563
01:17:54,660 --> 01:17:54,660
and you will know it,
you know,

1564
01:17:54,660 --> 01:17:57,230
if you're sort of starting to wake up 
with really severe hunger pangs.

1565
01:17:58,010 --> 01:18:01,730
What about supplements like melatonin 
supplements or things along those lines?

1566
01:18:02,780 --> 01:18:07,780
Melatonin is efficacious.
It's useful when you're traveling 

1567
01:18:08,211 --> 01:18:10,790
between time zones.
So at that point,

1568
01:18:10,791 --> 01:18:15,791
your body clock,
your internal clock is out of sync with 

1569
01:18:15,791 --> 01:18:16,130
the actual real time in the new time 
zone.

1570
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:20,030
And let's say I fly from los angeles 
over to london,

1571
01:18:20,031 --> 01:18:21,390
back home.
Um,

1572
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:26,600
you know,
my melatonin spike is going to be eight 

1573
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:26,600
hours in the past,
you know,

1574
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:31,360
sort of back in time.
It's not going to arrive with me for 

1575
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:32,300
eight hours.
So I can take some melatonin.

1576
01:18:32,301 --> 01:18:34,790
I can fool my brain into thinking,
oh my goodness,

1577
01:18:34,791 --> 01:18:37,820
it's actually dark when,
despite in California,

1578
01:18:37,821 --> 01:18:40,460
it's still daylight once I've arrived 
through airport.

1579
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:45,110
so you can use melatonin strategically 
for jet lag once people however,

1580
01:18:45,140 --> 01:18:50,140
are stable in a new time zone,
melatonin does not seem to be 

1581
01:18:50,271 --> 01:18:54,230
efficacious for helping sleep.
That said though,

1582
01:18:54,290 --> 01:18:57,740
if people out there taking melatonin and
they think it helps,

1583
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:02,800
I would tell them to keep taking it 
because the placebo effect is the most 

1584
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:04,760
reliable effecting all of pharmacology.
So if it works for you,

1585
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:05,900
no harm,
no foul.

1586
01:19:05,970 --> 01:19:07,100
He taking it interesting.

1587
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:08,000
So,
um,

1588
01:19:08,001 --> 01:19:12,950
the people that take melatonin nightly,
like this is what gets me to go to bed.

1589
01:19:12,980 --> 01:19:17,980
Really.
They're just playing a trick on their 

1590
01:19:17,980 --> 01:19:17,980
mind.
Yeah.

1591
01:19:17,980 --> 01:19:19,220
Unless you're an older individual where 
you're sort of 24 hour rhythm,

1592
01:19:19,221 --> 01:19:22,070
it's called your circadian rhythm starts
to get blunted in.

1593
01:19:22,071 --> 01:19:27,071
It's not as strong anymore.
That's where night nightly use of 

1594
01:19:27,071 --> 01:19:29,840
melatonin actually has been demonstrated
to be efficacious.

1595
01:19:30,020 --> 01:19:33,320
But if you're young,
healthy and you're taking melatonin,

1596
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:35,750
it's unlikely that it's actually helping
us sleep.

1597
01:19:35,780 --> 01:19:40,780
That's probably the placebo.
So it really should just be just for 

1598
01:19:40,780 --> 01:19:40,780
traveling.
Yeah.

1599
01:19:40,780 --> 01:19:44,420
Or weird situations where your sleep is 
interrupted.

1600
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:46,400
That's right.
And you need to kick it into gear,

1601
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:49,680
bring it back on.
So it's almost like a heck yeah,

1602
01:19:49,770 --> 01:19:50,480
it's definitely,
you know,

1603
01:19:50,481 --> 01:19:52,190
that's one way that you can check.
Like,

1604
01:19:52,191 --> 01:19:53,450
I mean,
there's no cure for jet lag,

1605
01:19:53,451 --> 01:19:55,580
but there's actually lots of ways that 
you can hack jetlag.

1606
01:19:55,700 --> 01:20:00,700
Are there any other vitamins or 
nutrients or particular foods that 

1607
01:20:03,021 --> 01:20:08,021
enhanced the sleepy effect?
There was always thing about trip to 

1608
01:20:08,021 --> 01:20:09,480
fan.
Everybody thought the trip to fan was in

1609
01:20:09,481 --> 01:20:14,481
Turkey.
What I read was that was bullshit and 

1610
01:20:14,481 --> 01:20:14,481
what was really good

1611
01:20:14,481 --> 01:20:18,320
going on was that you just ate a 
gigantic meal and it's filled with 

1612
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:20,160
stuffing and mashed potatoes and all 
those carbohydrates.

1613
01:20:20,190 --> 01:20:20,570
Kashi

1614
01:20:20,730 --> 01:20:23,580
crash,
and it's usually the time.

1615
01:20:23,581 --> 01:20:26,220
Then everyone goes back through into 
sort of the living room.

1616
01:20:26,221 --> 01:20:31,221
You lie down.
Most people are chronically sleep 

1617
01:20:31,221 --> 01:20:31,221
deprived,
right?

1618
01:20:31,221 --> 01:20:35,480
Finally you get the opportunity to sort 
of just relaxed and no one's doing 

1619
01:20:35,480 --> 01:20:36,190
anything because there's no plans.
What do,

1620
01:20:36,230 --> 01:20:39,000
what do you think the numbers are?
Sleep deprived people in this country.

1621
01:20:39,420 --> 01:20:41,190
So we know those numbers.
Actually,

1622
01:20:41,270 --> 01:20:46,270
I'm almost one out of every two adults 
in America and not getting the 

1623
01:20:46,591 --> 01:20:51,591
recommended eight hours of sleep.
Almost one out of every three people 

1624
01:20:51,591 --> 01:20:51,591
that you pass on the sleep,
uh,

1625
01:20:51,591 --> 01:20:54,810
on the street or trying to survive on 
six hours of or less of sleep.

1626
01:20:55,350 --> 01:20:56,940
Um,
back in 1942,

1627
01:20:56,941 --> 01:21:01,941
gallup did a poll and what they found 
was that the average american adult was 

1628
01:21:01,941 --> 01:21:03,480
sleeping seven point nine hours of sleep
a night.

1629
01:21:03,810 --> 01:21:08,810
Now that number or most recently is down
to six hours and 31 minutes for the 

1630
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:11,070
average adult during the week in 
America.

1631
01:21:11,250 --> 01:21:12,600
That's the average,
by the way,

1632
01:21:12,630 --> 01:21:16,350
that means that there's a huge swath of 
people well below that average.

1633
01:21:16,410 --> 01:21:17,910
Now,
what about the people that say that they

1634
01:21:17,911 --> 01:21:19,110
sleep,
they go to bed,

1635
01:21:19,430 --> 01:21:21,290
they sleep five hours,
they wake up,

1636
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:22,490
they feel great.
Yeah.

1637
01:21:22,780 --> 01:21:24,150
So bullshit.
Um,

1638
01:21:24,780 --> 01:21:29,780
we have the number of people who can 
survive on six hours of sleep or less 

1639
01:21:29,780 --> 01:21:34,700
without showing any impermanent,
rounded to a whole number and expressed 

1640
01:21:34,700 --> 01:21:35,520
as a percent of the population is zero.

1641
01:21:39,070 --> 01:21:41,080
Wow.
Yeah.

1642
01:21:41,140 --> 01:21:42,640
Wow.
Zero.

1643
01:21:44,410 --> 01:21:46,300
And one of the big problems with the 
lack of sleep,

1644
01:21:46,301 --> 01:21:51,301
by the way,
is that you don't know your sleep 

1645
01:21:51,301 --> 01:21:53,521
deprived when you're sleep deprived.
So your subjectIve sense of how well 

1646
01:21:53,521 --> 01:21:57,331
you're doing with a lack of sleep is a 
miserable predictor of objectively how 

1647
01:21:57,331 --> 01:21:57,331
you're doing.
so it's like,

1648
01:21:58,150 --> 01:21:59,750
yeah,
especially.

1649
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:01,660
Yeah.
Perfect example.

1650
01:22:01,661 --> 01:22:02,890
You know,
you're at the bar,

1651
01:22:02,891 --> 01:22:05,500
you've had six or seven.
I can drive home,

1652
01:22:05,501 --> 01:22:06,790
I'm fine.
And your response is,

1653
01:22:07,060 --> 01:22:10,060
I know that you think you'll find strive
subjectively objectively,

1654
01:22:10,061 --> 01:22:15,061
trust me you're not.
It's the same way with sleep 

1655
01:22:15,061 --> 01:22:15,061
deprivation.

1656
01:22:15,061 --> 01:22:16,150
That's fascinating.
So,

1657
01:22:16,180 --> 01:22:19,870
but you're not drunk,
so even though you're impaired,

1658
01:22:19,960 --> 01:22:24,960
you don't feel like you're impaired and 
you probably have a couple of espresso 

1659
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:27,580
or have one of these caveman coffee,
you feel fine,

1660
01:22:27,790 --> 01:22:28,960
right?
You get juiced up,

1661
01:22:29,300 --> 01:22:32,170
you're ready to go and you're trying to 
accomplish things.

1662
01:22:32,370 --> 01:22:34,450
You're trying to succeed,
right?

1663
01:22:34,660 --> 01:22:37,540
You're trying to get ahead in his life.
I don't need to sleep.

1664
01:22:38,190 --> 01:22:38,830
And it's,
you know,

1665
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:41,760
that's completely counter intuitive why 
it's on the data.

1666
01:22:41,790 --> 01:22:45,770
We know that people are more productive 
and they've.

1667
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:48,660
We've seen some of these studies in the 
workplace where you look firstly,

1668
01:22:48,810 --> 01:22:53,580
under slept employees will take on fewer
work challenges overall.

1669
01:22:53,910 --> 01:22:58,910
They ended up taking the the simple ones
like listening to voice messages rather 

1670
01:22:58,910 --> 01:22:59,970
than actually digging into deep project 
work.

1671
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:04,260
They produce fewer creative solutions to
challenges that you give them.

1672
01:23:04,900 --> 01:23:08,440
They also slack off when they're working
in groups.

1673
01:23:08,441 --> 01:23:13,441
It's called social loafing,
where they just ride the coattails of 

1674
01:23:13,441 --> 01:23:14,170
other people's hard work.
The less sleep that you have,

1675
01:23:14,171 --> 01:23:16,750
the more willing that you just sort of 
don't pull your weight.

1676
01:23:17,590 --> 01:23:19,930
Furthermore,
it goes all the way up to the top,

1677
01:23:20,050 --> 01:23:25,050
so the moral,
less sleep that a business leader has 

1678
01:23:25,050 --> 01:23:27,751
had from one night to the next,
the more or less charismatic that 

1679
01:23:27,751 --> 01:23:28,930
employees will rate that business 
leader.

1680
01:23:29,140 --> 01:23:32,620
Despite them knowing nothing about the 
sleep of that ceo,

1681
01:23:32,860 --> 01:23:36,430
it's evident in their behavior more 
because they're short with the,

1682
01:23:36,431 --> 01:23:36,880
you know,
they're,

1683
01:23:36,881 --> 01:23:41,881
they're short with their temper or 
they're quicker to get upset about 

1684
01:23:41,881 --> 01:23:45,271
things or less charismatic and social 
with their conversations.

1685
01:23:46,001 --> 01:23:46,980
They're just,
okay,

1686
01:23:46,981 --> 01:23:47,850
I got it.
I gOt it.

1687
01:23:47,860 --> 01:23:50,760
I got it to work for.
Yeah.

1688
01:23:51,020 --> 01:23:54,100
I'm so less than does not equal more 
productivity.

1689
01:23:54,340 --> 01:23:56,140
And it's always struck me as strange,
you know,

1690
01:23:56,141 --> 01:24:01,141
why do we sort of overvalue employees 
that undervalue sleep and if you look at

1691
01:24:01,691 --> 01:24:03,070
your workforce,
you know,

1692
01:24:03,430 --> 01:24:05,620
trust me,
everyone's going to be looking busy,

1693
01:24:05,621 --> 01:24:10,621
but it's like stationary bikes,
everyone's looking like they're working 

1694
01:24:10,621 --> 01:24:10,621
hard,
but there's no forward progress.

1695
01:24:10,621 --> 01:24:15,451
The scenery never changes.
That's what an under slept it workforce 

1696
01:24:15,451 --> 01:24:15,451
will be for you.
Now,

1697
01:24:15,451 --> 01:24:18,790
what about the amount of time that 
people spend at work?

1698
01:24:18,850 --> 01:24:22,150
I mean,
I know this is not related to to sleep,

1699
01:24:22,570 --> 01:24:24,670
but I've always felt like people weren't
too much.

1700
01:24:25,030 --> 01:24:29,440
I feel like you probably could get more 
done with lesS time there.

1701
01:24:29,950 --> 01:24:34,950
Yeah.
So efficiency is what we're talking 

1702
01:24:34,950 --> 01:24:34,950
about.
Again,

1703
01:24:34,950 --> 01:24:37,710
that's another one of those things with 
sleep deprivation and I think many 

1704
01:24:37,710 --> 01:24:38,260
people when they haven't had a good 
nights of sleep that,

1705
01:24:38,261 --> 01:24:43,261
you know,
they're looking at this report and they 

1706
01:24:43,261 --> 01:24:44,630
realized I've just read this paragraph 
the third time and I still can't quite 

1707
01:24:44,831 --> 01:24:49,360
get it as you had scrambled efficiency 
productivity.

1708
01:24:49,930 --> 01:24:51,040
But I would feel like,
um,

1709
01:24:51,041 --> 01:24:52,810
when people are working eight hours a 
day,

1710
01:24:53,500 --> 01:24:56,830
I don't think that you could work at 
peak capacity for eight hours at least I

1711
01:24:56,831 --> 01:24:59,260
don't think the average person can and 
you can't sustain that.

1712
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:02,110
So you're,
you're kInd of bleeding these people.

1713
01:25:02,140 --> 01:25:05,650
You're getting blood out of a rock in 
the last couple of hours and it's.

1714
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:06,820
Yeah.
And it's not,

1715
01:25:07,290 --> 01:25:12,290
you know,
either a creative way to work in 

1716
01:25:12,290 --> 01:25:12,290
creativity,
you know,

1717
01:25:12,290 --> 01:25:12,370
it's supposed to be the engine of know 
business,

1718
01:25:12,540 --> 01:25:13,780
uh,
and ingenuity.

1719
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:16,020
But why would you,
you know,

1720
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:19,480
take twice the amount of time to boil 
up,

1721
01:25:19,481 --> 01:25:24,481
you know,
a pot of water on half heat when you 

1722
01:25:24,481 --> 01:25:24,610
could do it in half the time if you just
put it on high.

1723
01:25:24,990 --> 01:25:26,080
Well that sleep,
you know,

1724
01:25:26,081 --> 01:25:31,081
it's interesting though,
there are certain writers who use sleep 

1725
01:25:31,081 --> 01:25:31,900
deprivation as a strategy for 
creativity.

1726
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:37,560
They literally don't start like the 
writers for the sitcom I was on news 

1727
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:41,581
radio,
they wouldn't start writing until like 

1728
01:25:41,581 --> 01:25:41,581
two,
three in the morning.

1729
01:25:41,581 --> 01:25:41,581
They would just play video games and 
fuck around.

1730
01:25:41,770 --> 01:25:44,500
And then late at night they would really
start writing.

1731
01:25:44,501 --> 01:25:45,880
And they would ride until like seven in 
the morning.

1732
01:25:45,881 --> 01:25:50,881
They would be,
they would stumble into the set like 

1733
01:25:50,881 --> 01:25:53,020
barefoot delirious hair,
all fucked up with hilarious scripts.

1734
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:58,500
And it's like they had used being silly 
and overtired as a strategy almost like 

1735
01:25:59,081 --> 01:26:02,110
they were doing drugs but they weren't 
doing any drugs.

1736
01:26:02,410 --> 01:26:04,390
I mean it comes to,
well we didn't,

1737
01:26:04,420 --> 01:26:05,950
we don't know in that scenario,
you know,

1738
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:08,000
it hasn't been sleep.
But what we have found,

1739
01:26:08,001 --> 01:26:13,001
at least in in our scientific studies,
is that that prefrontal cortex region 

1740
01:26:13,001 --> 01:26:14,960
that we spoke about before,
that sort of rational,

1741
01:26:14,961 --> 01:26:19,961
logical part of the brain,
that's one of the first things to go 

1742
01:26:19,961 --> 01:26:22,220
when you're sleep deprived.
So that area of the brain just gets sort

1743
01:26:22,221 --> 01:26:26,420
of switched off.
The more that you are sort of lacking in

1744
01:26:26,421 --> 01:26:29,900
your sleep and emotional deep emotional 
centers of the brain,

1745
01:26:30,230 --> 01:26:34,310
which are normally controlled and kept 
in check by that prefrontal cortex.

1746
01:26:34,730 --> 01:26:37,640
They just erupt In terms of their 
activity.

1747
01:26:37,641 --> 01:26:41,780
So you're all emotional gas pedal in two
little regulatory control break,

1748
01:26:42,110 --> 01:26:45,410
which for the most part very bad.
But you know,

1749
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:48,800
one possibility is that if you want to 
try and get a little bit sort of,

1750
01:26:48,860 --> 01:26:51,710
you know,
crazy loosey goosey,

1751
01:26:51,940 --> 01:26:56,940
you know,
maybe that's not bad for that type of 

1752
01:26:56,940 --> 01:26:59,591
sort of comedic writing that you know,
you become a bit more childlike and I 

1753
01:26:59,591 --> 01:27:03,760
say that affectionately because the last
part of the brain to mature in 

1754
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:05,210
development is the prefrontal cortex.

1755
01:27:05,330 --> 01:27:08,330
So you revert back to almost a more 
childlike state.

1756
01:27:08,331 --> 01:27:13,331
But I wouldn't,
I honestly would not condone that sort 

1757
01:27:13,331 --> 01:27:15,130
of undergoing sleep just based on the 
mortality and you know,

1758
01:27:15,740 --> 01:27:17,930
risk of alzheimer's and cancer by 
itself.

1759
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:20,840
You just don't want to keep.
Even in short doses,

1760
01:27:20,841 --> 01:27:22,880
like you're a couple days a week.
Like here's the,

1761
01:27:22,940 --> 01:27:25,370
if,
if sleep is not a renewable resource,

1762
01:27:25,820 --> 01:27:30,020
lIke what is the effect of say if you 
have three nights a week where you sleep

1763
01:27:30,021 --> 01:27:33,110
eight hours and then the next night,
two hours,

1764
01:27:33,980 --> 01:27:35,660
and then the next night,
eight hours,

1765
01:27:35,661 --> 01:27:40,661
how much of a bump or how much of a dip 
does that two hours give you and your 

1766
01:27:40,661 --> 01:27:41,750
overall health?
It's bad,

1767
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:44,540
it's bad.
So I'll give you two examples that there

1768
01:27:44,541 --> 01:27:49,541
was a study where they took individuals 
and they just gave them four hours of 

1769
01:27:49,541 --> 01:27:53,681
sleep for one night and what they saw 
was a 70 percent reduction in critical 

1770
01:27:53,721 --> 01:27:57,230
anticancer fighting immune cells called 
natural killer cells.

1771
01:27:57,650 --> 01:28:02,650
These are wonderful immune assassins 
that target malignant cells.

1772
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:08,200
So today,
both you and I have produced cancer 

1773
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:11,531
cells in our body.
what prevents those cancer cells from 

1774
01:28:11,531 --> 01:28:14,891
becoming the disease that we call cancer
is impart these natural killer cells and

1775
01:28:15,110 --> 01:28:20,110
after one night or four hours of sleep,
that is a remarkable state of immune 

1776
01:28:20,110 --> 01:28:23,870
deficiency and that's one of the reasons
why insufficient sleep predicts cancer.

1777
01:28:24,890 --> 01:28:27,170
I could also speak about your 
cardiovascular system though.

1778
01:28:27,260 --> 01:28:32,260
An all it takes is one hour because 
there is a global experiment that's 

1779
01:28:32,260 --> 01:28:36,431
performed on one point 6 billion people 
across 70 countries twice a year and 

1780
01:28:36,831 --> 01:28:41,831
it's called daylight savings time.
Now in the spring when we lose an hour 

1781
01:28:41,831 --> 01:28:46,361
of sleep,
we see a subsequent 24 percent increase 

1782
01:28:46,361 --> 01:28:47,900
in heart attacks.
What in the fall?

1783
01:28:48,020 --> 01:28:49,550
In the autumn,
when we gain an hour sleep,

1784
01:28:49,551 --> 01:28:52,370
there's a 21 percent decrease in heart 
attacks,

1785
01:28:52,640 --> 01:28:57,640
so it's bi directional.
That's how fragile and vulnerable your 

1786
01:28:57,640 --> 01:28:59,900
body is to even just the smallest 
perturbation of sleep.

1787
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:01,890
An hour one hour is insane.

1788
01:29:02,230 --> 01:29:04,080
Yeah.
wow.

1789
01:29:05,250 --> 01:29:07,260
That is.
You're blowing my fucking mind.

1790
01:29:07,460 --> 01:29:12,460
It's funny.
I mean you can go even further by the 

1791
01:29:12,460 --> 01:29:12,460
way.
Wow.

1792
01:29:12,460 --> 01:29:16,260
Insufficient sleep will even erode the 
very fabric of biological life itself.

1793
01:29:16,350 --> 01:29:21,350
Your dna code.
So In one study they took a group of 

1794
01:29:21,350 --> 01:29:25,191
healthy adults and they limited them to 
six hours of sleep for one week and they

1795
01:29:25,561 --> 01:29:30,561
compared to the profile of gene activity
relative to when those same people were 

1796
01:29:30,561 --> 01:29:33,540
getting eight hours of sleep and there 
were two critical results.

1797
01:29:33,900 --> 01:29:38,900
The first was that a sizable 711 genes 
were distorted in their activity caused 

1798
01:29:40,681 --> 01:29:45,681
by one week of six hours of sleep,
which is highly relevant by the way 

1799
01:29:45,681 --> 01:29:49,861
because we know that many people are 
trying to survive on six hours of sleep 

1800
01:29:49,861 --> 01:29:49,861
during the week.
Wow.

1801
01:29:50,440 --> 01:29:51,970
The second.
Sorry.

1802
01:29:52,150 --> 01:29:52,810
No,
please go.

1803
01:29:53,170 --> 01:29:56,320
I was going to say the second sort of 
perhaps more interesting result was that

1804
01:29:56,321 --> 01:29:59,740
about half of those genes we're actually
increasing their activity.

1805
01:29:59,980 --> 01:30:04,980
The other half were actually suppressed.
Those genes that were switched off by 

1806
01:30:04,980 --> 01:30:09,721
six hours of sleep for one week.
What genes related to your immune 

1807
01:30:09,721 --> 01:30:09,721
response?
Many of them.

1808
01:30:09,721 --> 01:30:14,670
So you become immune deficient.
Those genes that were increased or what 

1809
01:30:14,670 --> 01:30:18,370
we call overexpressed with genes that 
were related to the promotion of tumors,

1810
01:30:18,730 --> 01:30:23,350
genes that were related to longterm 
chronic inflammation within the body and

1811
01:30:23,351 --> 01:30:26,710
genes that were associated with stress 
and as a consequence,

1812
01:30:26,711 --> 01:30:28,030
cardiovascular disease.

1813
01:30:28,790 --> 01:30:30,680
This is unbelievable.
You know,

1814
01:30:30,681 --> 01:30:35,681
it's really disturbing to me.
I'm in my youth from age probably.

1815
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:41,270
I guess I was probably 18 when I 
started.

1816
01:30:41,420 --> 01:30:46,420
I delivered newspapers.
I used to drive around and throw 

1817
01:30:46,420 --> 01:30:48,770
newspapers out of my car and I did it 
for years and uh,

1818
01:30:48,771 --> 01:30:51,640
I would have to be up at 5:00
every morning and,

1819
01:30:51,820 --> 01:30:53,140
uh,
I never,

1820
01:30:53,890 --> 01:30:55,750
never went to bed early.
Yeah,

1821
01:30:56,050 --> 01:30:58,450
ever.
And I worked 365 days a year.

1822
01:30:58,480 --> 01:30:59,380
How old were you,
by the way?

1823
01:30:59,710 --> 01:31:04,710
I think I started when I was 18.
I might've been 17 whenever I started 

1824
01:31:04,710 --> 01:31:05,380
driving.
Well I drove at 16,

1825
01:31:05,381 --> 01:31:07,810
but I don't think I started right away 
delivering newspapers,

1826
01:31:07,811 --> 01:31:11,080
but it was trying to find a,
a good part time job.

1827
01:31:11,950 --> 01:31:16,950
I think I was either in my senior year 
of high school or after I think right 

1828
01:31:16,950 --> 01:31:18,550
after my senior year of high school,
so I was probably 18.

1829
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:18,870
Okay.

1830
01:31:19,020 --> 01:31:24,020
And the reason I ask by the way is 
because as you go through into their 

1831
01:31:24,020 --> 01:31:24,450
sort of latest stages of adolescent 
sensitive early adulthood,

1832
01:31:24,660 --> 01:31:27,180
your biological rhythm moves forWard in 
time.

1833
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:29,520
So you want to go to bed later and wake 
up later.

1834
01:31:29,790 --> 01:31:33,030
so even if you went to bed sort of 
conscientiously at that time,

1835
01:31:33,240 --> 01:31:34,500
at the seed,
like 10:00

1836
01:31:34,501 --> 01:31:39,501
or 9:00,
you wouldn't be able to sleep because 

1837
01:31:39,501 --> 01:31:39,501
it's biologically impossible.

1838
01:31:39,501 --> 01:31:39,501
Yeah,
no,

1839
01:31:39,501 --> 01:31:40,780
I didn't sleep.
And then on saturday,

1840
01:31:40,781 --> 01:31:43,720
even worse one day a week,
saturday night,

1841
01:31:43,721 --> 01:31:48,721
I'd have to get up at three or four in 
the morning because I had to deliver 

1842
01:31:48,721 --> 01:31:52,390
sunday papers in the sunday.
Papers were enormous and so I had a pack

1843
01:31:52,391 --> 01:31:56,140
of van filled with site 350 people that 
are delivered papers too,

1844
01:31:56,141 --> 01:31:59,990
so I'd have to do multiple trips so I'd 
start work [inaudible].

1845
01:32:00,760 --> 01:32:03,550
I'd start delivering somewhere around 
4:35

1846
01:32:03,551 --> 01:32:07,780
depending on when the paper's got in and
I was done by like nine,

1847
01:32:08,530 --> 01:32:09,880
nine,
30 and then I tried to crash,

1848
01:32:09,881 --> 01:32:11,770
but I was a wreck.
I mean,

1849
01:32:11,771 --> 01:32:13,870
and it,
it fucked me up for years.

1850
01:32:13,900 --> 01:32:16,780
For years I did that and I stop and 
think about that.

1851
01:32:16,781 --> 01:32:20,060
Now I'm listening to you listening to 
this conversation,

1852
01:32:20,061 --> 01:32:22,840
like what kind of fucking damaged that I
do to myself over those years.

1853
01:32:23,170 --> 01:32:28,170
Yeah.
I Will tell you about the stuff with 

1854
01:32:28,170 --> 01:32:29,491
outside mr hannon,
lloyd protein and I feel okay now and 

1855
01:32:29,491 --> 01:32:29,950
it's been.
It's been several decades.

1856
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:36,360
Did I mentioned that your subjective 
sense of how well you're doing with 

1857
01:32:36,360 --> 01:32:36,360
insufficient sleep isn't.
No,

1858
01:32:36,360 --> 01:32:36,360
no.
Wow.

1859
01:32:36,360 --> 01:32:40,681
I'm sure you did.
And I'm sure that there's a factor 

1860
01:32:40,681 --> 01:32:40,681
there.
Um,

1861
01:32:40,681 --> 01:32:41,020
what's stunning to me is that

1862
01:32:41,270 --> 01:32:46,270
sours is so detrimental.
I would've thought that had been fine 

1863
01:32:46,270 --> 01:32:47,750
for six hours is good.
Like you get six hours ads.

1864
01:32:47,751 --> 01:32:49,040
Good.
That's normal for me.

1865
01:32:49,720 --> 01:32:53,450
Like six hours is normal.
Like literally the minimum is seven.

1866
01:32:53,740 --> 01:32:55,300
Yeah.
Seven to nine hours of sleep.

1867
01:32:55,301 --> 01:32:57,940
Seven you need anything under seven is 
bullshit.

1868
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:58,900
Yep.
for the,

1869
01:32:58,990 --> 01:33:03,990
for the average there is,
there is a small fraction of one percent

1870
01:33:04,421 --> 01:33:09,421
of the population that has a special 
gene that allows them to survive on 

1871
01:33:09,421 --> 01:33:11,170
about five hours of sleep.
Um,

1872
01:33:11,350 --> 01:33:13,240
and most people when I tell them this,
they say,

1873
01:33:13,300 --> 01:33:14,880
oh,
I have that.

1874
01:33:15,070 --> 01:33:18,490
I'm one of those people.
The chances of you being,

1875
01:33:18,640 --> 01:33:20,170
you know,
you're much more likely,

1876
01:33:20,171 --> 01:33:25,171
for example,
to be struck by lightning in your 

1877
01:33:25,171 --> 01:33:27,271
lifetime,
the of which I think about one in 

1878
01:33:27,271 --> 01:33:29,730
$12,500.
Then you also have this incredibly rare 

1879
01:33:29,730 --> 01:33:31,450
gene that means you can survive on 
something around five hours of sleep.

1880
01:33:31,510 --> 01:33:33,670
Really?
And what is the gene?

1881
01:33:34,270 --> 01:33:39,270
Well,
it's a gene that seems to promote sort 

1882
01:33:39,270 --> 01:33:39,270
of,
again,

1883
01:33:39,270 --> 01:33:42,960
wakefulness,
chemistry within the brain that allows 

1884
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:45,640
you to sort of maintain wakefulness in a
more sustained way.

1885
01:33:46,390 --> 01:33:51,390
Um,
and so we're only trying to understand 

1886
01:33:51,390 --> 01:33:54,211
right now what the actual biochemical 
mechanisms are of in terms of the 

1887
01:33:54,211 --> 01:33:55,510
consequences of that gene,
that gene mutation.

1888
01:33:56,290 --> 01:34:01,290
Um,
but certainly it seems to exist that 

1889
01:34:01,290 --> 01:34:01,960
there are some of those,
quote unquote short sleepers by the way,

1890
01:34:01,961 --> 01:34:04,330
you know,
we hear if these business leaders,

1891
01:34:04,810 --> 01:34:07,840
and even actually heads of state,
I'm not going to name any names but I'll

1892
01:34:07,841 --> 01:34:12,841
give you right now,
but I'll give you two examples of the 

1893
01:34:12,841 --> 01:34:14,320
past.
Margaret thatcher and ronald reagan both

1894
01:34:14,350 --> 01:34:19,350
were vociferouslY in the statement and 
their declaration of how little sleep 

1895
01:34:19,350 --> 01:34:23,581
that they would get.
Both of them said four or five hours a 

1896
01:34:23,581 --> 01:34:23,800
night.
And I think in part it was to paint this

1897
01:34:23,801 --> 01:34:27,420
heroic ironclad status.
Um,

1898
01:34:27,490 --> 01:34:32,490
many people would say to me,
you don't know margaret thatcher 

1899
01:34:32,490 --> 01:34:32,490
lifetime,
well,

1900
01:34:32,490 --> 01:34:37,230
sadly and tragically fascia and reagan 
both ended up getting alzheimer's 

1901
01:34:37,230 --> 01:34:37,230
disease.

1902
01:34:37,230 --> 01:34:41,970
You know,
and we now know because of its during 

1903
01:34:41,970 --> 01:34:44,941
deep sleep at night that there is a 
sewage system in the brain that kicks 

1904
01:34:44,941 --> 01:34:49,531
into high gear.
And it cleanses the brain of all of the 

1905
01:34:49,531 --> 01:34:50,140
metabolic toxins that have been built up
throughout the day.

1906
01:34:50,260 --> 01:34:55,260
This low level brain damage,
one of those toxic sticky proteins that 

1907
01:34:55,260 --> 01:34:59,761
builds up whilst we're awake is called 
beta amyloid beta amyloid is one of the 

1908
01:34:59,761 --> 01:35:02,720
leading causes of underlying the 
mechanism of alzheimer's disease.

1909
01:35:03,200 --> 01:35:06,170
So the less sleep that you're having 
across the lifespan,

1910
01:35:06,440 --> 01:35:11,000
the more of that toxic amyloid is 
building up night after night,

1911
01:35:11,060 --> 01:35:14,300
year after year.
And I don't think it's coincidental that

1912
01:35:14,301 --> 01:35:19,301
both of them ended up progressing into 
tragically into a state of alzheimer's 

1913
01:35:19,301 --> 01:35:21,710
disease.
So it's good night's sleep clean in that

1914
01:35:21,711 --> 01:35:22,580
way.
In terms of,

1915
01:35:22,630 --> 01:35:23,510
uh,
of deep sleep,

1916
01:35:23,630 --> 01:35:24,470
that's critical.

1917
01:35:24,590 --> 01:35:26,160
That is stunning.
Um,

1918
01:35:26,390 --> 01:35:29,630
are there anything,
is there anything you can do in terms of

1919
01:35:29,631 --> 01:35:34,550
how you eat or supplements you can take 
that could potentially at least somewhat

1920
01:35:34,551 --> 01:35:36,590
mitigate the effects of having no sleep?

1921
01:35:37,710 --> 01:35:40,170
We haven't found any good counter 
measures.

1922
01:35:40,260 --> 01:35:42,330
Have you tried diet pills?
So,

1923
01:35:42,370 --> 01:35:47,370
um,
people have tried things like a fog or 

1924
01:35:47,370 --> 01:35:48,870
in the academy,
amphetamines,

1925
01:35:49,380 --> 01:35:49,900
you know,
I mean,

1926
01:35:49,950 --> 01:35:54,950
caffeine has been used strategically by 
the military for years and caffeine can 

1927
01:35:55,200 --> 01:35:58,170
help you get over the basic reduction in
your alertness.

1928
01:35:58,171 --> 01:36:03,171
So basic response times you can,
you can dose with caffeine and still 

1929
01:36:03,811 --> 01:36:07,770
maintain some degree of a fast response 
under conditions of sleep deprivation.

1930
01:36:08,280 --> 01:36:13,280
What about provigil or nuvigil?
You started modafinil is sort of the 

1931
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:16,290
underlying chemical there and debated 
who actually came up with.

1932
01:36:16,291 --> 01:36:21,291
It may have been the french military who
actually ended up being the generators 

1933
01:36:21,291 --> 01:36:23,490
of that.
That seems to work through a pathway,

1934
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:27,270
at least right now as we understand it 
for a chemical called dopamine,

1935
01:36:27,300 --> 01:36:29,760
and dopamine is principally known as 
pleasure drug.

1936
01:36:30,030 --> 01:36:34,110
It's the chemical that a lot of drugs of
abuse will target to sort of ramp up,

1937
01:36:34,410 --> 01:36:39,410
but it also is a basic alertness drug 
that when you get an increase in 

1938
01:36:39,410 --> 01:36:43,671
dopamine,
you tend to actually get an increase in 

1939
01:36:43,671 --> 01:36:46,161
your alertness and your wakefulness.
Don't you get an increase in happiness 

1940
01:36:46,161 --> 01:36:46,161
as well?
You can too,

1941
01:36:46,161 --> 01:36:50,070
although modafinil tends to come with 
the alertness component of that equation

1942
01:36:50,250 --> 01:36:55,250
and less so with the euphoria.
That's why it has a lower prevalence of 

1943
01:36:55,250 --> 01:36:56,760
sort of addiction and abuse.

1944
01:36:57,200 --> 01:36:58,670
Well,
I know a lot of people who are,

1945
01:36:58,730 --> 01:37:02,720
I woulDn't say they abuse it,
but they say they have to use it.

1946
01:37:02,810 --> 01:37:05,510
Like all the doctor says,
the doctor says I got to use it.

1947
01:37:06,310 --> 01:37:11,310
I'm always suspicious because they seem 
pretty normal other than the fact that 

1948
01:37:11,310 --> 01:37:15,941
they,
they're exhausted if they don't take 

1949
01:37:15,941 --> 01:37:15,941
this with what's essentially a 
stimulant.

1950
01:37:15,941 --> 01:37:17,840
I've taken it a few times.
I've taken it when,

1951
01:37:17,910 --> 01:37:22,910
uh,
I have to drive like long periods of 

1952
01:37:22,910 --> 01:37:25,091
time.
Like I'm driving from san diego to 

1953
01:37:25,091 --> 01:37:26,711
California or to los angeles and maybe I
have a gig my gigs done at like 1130.

1954
01:37:27,411 --> 01:37:28,970
I know I'm going to be on the road late 
at night.

1955
01:37:28,971 --> 01:37:33,420
I might take one and it's fine,
but it gives you this weird feeling.

1956
01:37:33,421 --> 01:37:38,421
It's a weird state and I know all.
Lot of tech people.

1957
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:41,520
Yep.
A lot of silicon valley is on this stuff

1958
01:37:41,521 --> 01:37:44,640
and they pop it like candy.
So much so that tim ferriss,

1959
01:37:44,850 --> 01:37:47,250
when he was writing his book,
the four hour body,

1960
01:37:47,430 --> 01:37:52,430
he didn't want to include it and didn't 
want include this particular drug 

1961
01:37:52,430 --> 01:37:53,790
because he felt like people were just 
going to eat it all the time.

1962
01:37:53,960 --> 01:37:58,960
Yeah,
I mean it's throughout student 

1963
01:37:58,960 --> 01:37:59,280
populations.
Study drug as well as adderall.

1964
01:37:59,330 --> 01:38:00,920
Yeah.
As an adult,

1965
01:38:00,921 --> 01:38:05,921
you know,
and one of the interesting things is 

1966
01:38:05,921 --> 01:38:07,350
that if you look at the,
the profile of what sleep deprivation is

1967
01:38:07,351 --> 01:38:08,460
cognitively,
you know,

1968
01:38:08,461 --> 01:38:10,800
reduced alertness,
impulsivity,

1969
01:38:11,010 --> 01:38:16,010
lack of ability to concentrate,
difficulties with learning and memory 

1970
01:38:16,010 --> 01:38:19,581
difficulties with behavioral problems.
If I were to describe those features to 

1971
01:38:19,581 --> 01:38:21,420
a pediatrician and say,
what disorder is this?

1972
01:38:22,170 --> 01:38:25,050
ProbablY say it's,
it's adhd,

1973
01:38:25,110 --> 01:38:30,110
yes,
but what we now know is that there is 

1974
01:38:30,110 --> 01:38:32,421
some portion of children out there who 
are diagnosed with adhd who either won 

1975
01:38:32,430 --> 01:38:37,430
or just under slept or to actually have 
sleep disordered breathing because of 

1976
01:38:37,430 --> 01:38:39,720
perhaps tonsil problems where they're 
not getting sufficient sleep.

1977
01:38:39,960 --> 01:38:43,080
And when you treat the Sleep disorder,
when you do a sort of,

1978
01:38:43,250 --> 01:38:48,250
you know,
remove the tonsils and they start 

1979
01:38:48,250 --> 01:38:49,050
sleeping normally and the adhd 
disappears.

1980
01:38:49,650 --> 01:38:54,390
So there is an issue here I think within
that sort of the explosion of adhd,

1981
01:38:54,391 --> 01:38:56,370
not all people are,
you know,

1982
01:38:56,490 --> 01:39:00,540
sort of privy to this sort of sleep 
problem simply masquerading as adhd.

1983
01:39:00,630 --> 01:39:03,510
Some people are the,
one of the other problems too though,

1984
01:39:03,511 --> 01:39:08,511
is that adhd kids tend not to sleep very
well and what we ended up giving them is

1985
01:39:09,871 --> 01:39:14,871
a drug that is a stimulant which will 
combat sleep and fight back against 

1986
01:39:15,061 --> 01:39:17,430
sleep.
So I think we need to have a bit more of

1987
01:39:17,431 --> 01:39:22,431
a strategic approach is to when we think
about at least the dose of that 

1988
01:39:22,431 --> 01:39:26,290
medication in terms of when sleep should
be x sort of expected during the day 

1989
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:31,400
because you know,
taking it in the middle of the day in 

1990
01:39:31,400 --> 01:39:32,220
the evening or if it's a stimulant,
it's wake promoting drug need to be very

1991
01:39:32,221 --> 01:39:33,570
careful to sleep.
As part of that.

1992
01:39:33,570 --> 01:39:38,040
It was terrifying because I don't know 
if the people that are prescribing these

1993
01:39:38,041 --> 01:39:43,041
things have the sort of deep education 
and sleep and the necessity of it that 

1994
01:39:43,041 --> 01:39:43,590
you do.
They don't and you know,

1995
01:39:43,591 --> 01:39:45,450
it's not their fault either.
You know.

1996
01:39:45,740 --> 01:39:47,730
In fact,
I've started to try and lobby doctors to

1997
01:39:47,731 --> 01:39:51,720
start prescribing sleep and don't make 
the mistake that that's me suggesting,

1998
01:39:51,900 --> 01:39:56,900
you know,
prescribing sleeping pills that's a 

1999
01:39:56,900 --> 01:39:59,541
separate,
straight sleeping pills are associated 

2000
01:39:59,541 --> 01:39:59,541
with significantly higher risk of death 
and cancer.

2001
01:39:59,541 --> 01:40:04,371
And I'm happy to speak about that too.
It was the one chapter in the book that 

2002
01:40:04,371 --> 01:40:04,430
I think the,
um,

2003
01:40:04,470 --> 01:40:07,500
the legal team of my publisher took,
took a very long,

2004
01:40:07,590 --> 01:40:12,590
long look at.
But I think doctors come back to your 

2005
01:40:12,590 --> 01:40:16,281
point,
they on average only have about two 

2006
01:40:16,281 --> 01:40:16,980
hours of sleep education in the medical 
curriculum.

2007
01:40:17,550 --> 01:40:19,320
So 1:32
hours,

2008
01:40:19,321 --> 01:40:24,321
two hours,
one third of this podcast has been two 

2009
01:40:24,321 --> 01:40:24,321
hours.

2010
01:40:24,321 --> 01:40:24,930
Yeah,
that's fucking crazy.

2011
01:40:25,080 --> 01:40:27,090
Isn't that frightening?
That's terrifying.

2012
01:40:27,091 --> 01:40:32,091
And I bet you probably have laid things 
out better in this podcast then you 

2013
01:40:32,091 --> 01:40:32,520
would get in those two hours of 
education.

2014
01:40:33,190 --> 01:40:34,620
I,
I don't know about that,

2015
01:40:34,621 --> 01:40:36,750
but I'll give you that credit if they 
could,

2016
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:39,360
if they could increase that,
you know,

2017
01:40:39,410 --> 01:40:41,830
I'm desperately appealing for this,
you know,

2018
01:40:41,831 --> 01:40:46,831
it's a third of their patient's life,
but they only get two hours of 

2019
01:40:46,831 --> 01:40:50,541
education.
But the other problem is the medical 

2020
01:40:50,541 --> 01:40:50,541
industry itself,
by the way,

2021
01:40:50,541 --> 01:40:52,640
you know that residents that data,
you know,

2022
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:57,880
junior residents working a 30 hour shift
of 460 percent more likely to make 

2023
01:40:59,621 --> 01:41:03,460
diagnostic errors in the intensive care 
unit relative to when they're working 16

2024
01:41:03,461 --> 01:41:05,620
hours.
If you have elective surgery,

2025
01:41:05,621 --> 01:41:09,100
you should ask your surgeon how much 
sleep they've had in the past 24 hours.

2026
01:41:09,460 --> 01:41:11,710
If they've had six hours of sleep or 
less,

2027
01:41:12,040 --> 01:41:17,040
you have a 170 percent increased risk of
a major surgical error such as sort of 

2028
01:41:18,940 --> 01:41:23,940
organ damage or hemorrhaging relative to
that same surgeon if they had been well 

2029
01:41:25,061 --> 01:41:25,600
rested.

2030
01:41:26,020 --> 01:41:30,580
And then the irony here by the way,
is that when a resident finishes,

2031
01:41:30,581 --> 01:41:34,240
a 30 hour shift,
gets back into their car to drive home,

2032
01:41:34,630 --> 01:41:39,630
there is a 168 percent increase risk 
that they will get into a car accident 

2033
01:41:39,670 --> 01:41:44,440
because of the under state being ending 
up back in the same emergency room where

2034
01:41:44,441 --> 01:41:48,190
they just came from.
but now as a patient from a car crash,

2035
01:41:48,490 --> 01:41:49,180
you know,
it's.

2036
01:41:49,240 --> 01:41:54,240
We need to radically rethink the 
importance of sleep in education in,

2037
01:41:54,480 --> 01:41:56,410
in business,
in the workplace,

2038
01:41:56,680 --> 01:42:00,070
and in medicine too.
Why do they do that to residents?

2039
01:42:00,640 --> 01:42:02,820
It's a fascinating story.
Um,

2040
01:42:02,860 --> 01:42:04,200
so there's,
there's a chapter,

2041
01:42:04,320 --> 01:42:08,290
I'm in the book on this too.
It's a guy called william halsted and he

2042
01:42:08,291 --> 01:42:13,291
set up the first resident surgical 
program in the United States at johns 

2043
01:42:13,291 --> 01:42:17,851
hopkins university,
and he was known for being able to stay 

2044
01:42:17,851 --> 01:42:20,560
awake for these heroic lengths of time,
days on end.

2045
01:42:20,950 --> 01:42:24,100
It was iNcredible,
like superhuman strength.

2046
01:42:24,820 --> 01:42:27,340
Turns out that in later years after he 
died,

2047
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:32,760
there was a dirty secret that he was 
actually a cocaine addict,

2048
01:42:32,970 --> 01:42:35,140
that son of a bitch.
And here's what happened.

2049
01:42:35,141 --> 01:42:37,110
It wasn't his fault.
Yeah.

2050
01:42:37,250 --> 01:42:42,250
Alien is Korea.
He was examining the anesthetic 

2051
01:42:42,250 --> 01:42:43,090
capacities of cocaine.
So,

2052
01:42:43,210 --> 01:42:45,160
you know,
if I'm not going to save,

2053
01:42:45,161 --> 01:42:50,161
you know,
you may have heard from a perhaps 

2054
01:42:50,161 --> 01:42:51,700
colleagues that when you snort cocaine,
you get a numb face.

2055
01:42:52,150 --> 01:42:56,140
The reason is because it's,
it blocks nerves from colleagues.

2056
01:42:57,140 --> 01:43:01,270
My colleagues have told me I've actually
never done cocaine out of.

2057
01:43:01,300 --> 01:43:04,120
I've known quite a few people who have 
and they will,

2058
01:43:04,140 --> 01:43:05,830
you know,
they'll have their sort of numbness.

2059
01:43:05,831 --> 01:43:10,831
It's the reason is because cocaine is 
also a nerve blocking agents like 

2060
01:43:10,831 --> 01:43:10,831
lighter cane lidacain.
Exactly.

2061
01:43:10,831 --> 01:43:15,780
Talked about this yesterday,
ironically on the podcast and about 

2062
01:43:15,780 --> 01:43:15,780
doctors becoming drug addicts.

2063
01:43:15,780 --> 01:43:17,080
The initial doctor started doing 
lidacain.

2064
01:43:17,200 --> 01:43:21,940
Hosted was he became an accidental 
cocaine addict.

2065
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:25,360
Wow.
And then for days and he was up for days

2066
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:30,600
and he structured a program where he 
expected his residence to match him to 

2067
01:43:30,611 --> 01:43:34,450
go toe to toe with them.
But yeah,

2068
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,270
it sounds like what a cokehead would do.
Come on and stay aWay.

2069
01:43:37,330 --> 01:43:42,330
Unbelievable.
And I think the story was that he 

2070
01:43:42,330 --> 01:43:42,730
actually knew that there was a problem.
He went to rehabilitation,

2071
01:43:42,731 --> 01:43:47,731
checked in under a different surname and
one part of the regiment for him coming 

2072
01:43:48,581 --> 01:43:53,581
off cocaine was to prescribe morphine.
And at the end of the rehabilitation 

2073
01:43:53,901 --> 01:43:58,790
program he came out with both the 
cocaine addiction and heroin addiction.

2074
01:43:59,630 --> 01:44:04,630
And so now there's rumors that he would 
get his shirts laundered in paris,

2075
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:08,310
in France,
and you know,

2076
01:44:08,510 --> 01:44:12,670
they would come back and it wasn't just 
the white starched shirts that,

2077
01:44:12,900 --> 01:44:15,890
that were in the box that we were other 
whites substances too.

2078
01:44:16,130 --> 01:44:17,210
But that's,
you know,

2079
01:44:17,211 --> 01:44:19,700
you ask a great question,
where did that come from?

2080
01:44:19,701 --> 01:44:22,850
Where's that history?
The legacy seems to date back to william

2081
01:44:22,851 --> 01:44:25,670
halsted,
who is an accidental cocaine addict.

2082
01:44:25,910 --> 01:44:30,910
And the,
we then maintained that inhumane 

2083
01:44:30,910 --> 01:44:34,810
practice in medicine,
which is so critical to be awake and 

2084
01:44:35,961 --> 01:44:39,530
aware and to be sharp.
You're cutting people open,

2085
01:44:39,560 --> 01:44:44,560
you're operating on people.
And think back to what we said about 

2086
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:44,560
being awake,
you know,

2087
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:47,090
you would never accept treatment from a 
doctor who started,

2088
01:44:47,120 --> 01:44:49,340
you know,
looking at your child who's sick with an

2089
01:44:49,341 --> 01:44:51,260
appendicitis at 3:00
AM in the morning,

2090
01:44:51,410 --> 01:44:53,120
who then switched some whiskey and says,
yeah,

2091
01:44:53,121 --> 01:44:55,130
I'm going to do the operations fine.
You would,

2092
01:44:55,560 --> 01:44:57,050
you'd go ballistic.
Well,

2093
01:44:57,320 --> 01:45:01,190
why do we accept treatment after 20 
hours of being awake?

2094
01:45:01,490 --> 01:45:04,130
Your as empowered as you would be if you
were legally drunk.

2095
01:45:04,370 --> 01:45:09,370
So unfortunately we placed young 
residents in this position of acting and

2096
01:45:09,770 --> 01:45:13,400
operating and decision making under 
conditions of insufficient sleep.

2097
01:45:13,780 --> 01:45:18,780
One in five medical residents will make 
a serious medical errors due to 

2098
01:45:18,780 --> 01:45:23,360
insufficient sleep wanting 20 medical 
residents will kill a patient because of

2099
01:45:23,361 --> 01:45:26,810
a fatigue related error.
One in 20.

2100
01:45:26,990 --> 01:45:30,410
That's crazy right now.
You know there are well over 20,000

2101
01:45:30,411 --> 01:45:32,840
medical residents.
If you have 100 of them.

2102
01:45:32,841 --> 01:45:35,390
Five were going to kill people.
Accidental deaths.

2103
01:45:35,440 --> 01:45:37,640
Think about that number.
That's insane.

2104
01:45:37,850 --> 01:45:40,670
If we were to solve the sleep loss 
epidemic in medicine,

2105
01:45:40,780 --> 01:45:45,780
you know,
we could start saving lives and I don't 

2106
01:45:45,780 --> 01:45:45,780
know what it is.
Is it just a,

2107
01:45:45,780 --> 01:45:46,790
you know,
an old boys network where we used to.

2108
01:45:46,810 --> 01:45:48,050
Well we went through it.
Yes.

2109
01:45:48,051 --> 01:45:49,830
So you've got to go through it,
you know,

2110
01:45:49,831 --> 01:45:52,880
and the data now is so prolific,
you know,

2111
01:45:52,881 --> 01:45:56,930
I write to all about that and try to 
make a builder an evidence based,

2112
01:45:57,140 --> 01:45:57,950
you know,
emotional,

2113
01:45:57,960 --> 01:46:01,520
emotionless,
cold case for sleep in medicine,

2114
01:46:01,560 --> 01:46:03,500
asleep prescription for medicine as it 
were.

2115
01:46:03,740 --> 01:46:07,520
Or most people don't realize the 
requirements of residents have no.

2116
01:46:08,600 --> 01:46:11,060
And they are,
they are literally,

2117
01:46:11,220 --> 01:46:16,220
you know,
beyond human capacity thinking that 

2118
01:46:16,220 --> 01:46:20,090
hubris and some degree of hours on the 
job is going to be able to allow you to 

2119
01:46:20,721 --> 01:46:25,721
sort of cut short what took three and a 
half million years to sort of,

2120
01:46:26,900 --> 01:46:31,900
you know,
get in place which is an eight hour 

2121
01:46:31,900 --> 01:46:31,900
night of sleep that's just thick headed,
you know,

2122
01:46:31,900 --> 01:46:33,350
it's,
and I think the medical profession,

2123
01:46:33,351 --> 01:46:36,320
it maybe at the stage where it's my mind
is made up.

2124
01:46:36,350 --> 01:46:39,170
Don't confuse me with the facts.
Wow.

2125
01:46:39,770 --> 01:46:42,650
That,
that this has blown me away.

2126
01:46:42,830 --> 01:46:47,830
I just don't understand how the very 
people that are working on the health of

2127
01:46:49,050 --> 01:46:50,430
patients and fixing

2128
01:46:50,430 --> 01:46:55,320
them and repairing injuries and taking 
care of diseases,

2129
01:46:55,590 --> 01:47:00,590
those are the people that are ignoring 
one of the primary factors of disease 

2130
01:47:00,590 --> 01:47:03,810
and errors and cognitive function 
impairment.

2131
01:47:03,960 --> 01:47:06,510
It's a travesty.
I have a friend who's an ophthalmologist

2132
01:47:06,511 --> 01:47:08,580
and he tells a story about during his 
residency,

2133
01:47:08,581 --> 01:47:13,581
he was,
is back in the eighties and he had a 

2134
01:47:13,581 --> 01:47:15,330
pager.
He was on the toilet with a tray of food

2135
01:47:15,390 --> 01:47:18,870
on his lap because he didn't have time 
to eat and go to the bathroom,

2136
01:47:18,990 --> 01:47:23,990
so it was eating food and he fell asleep
and then his pager went off and he's 

2137
01:47:24,181 --> 01:47:25,080
like,
fuck my life.

2138
01:47:27,390 --> 01:47:32,390
How many warnings,
how many warning bells do you need to 

2139
01:47:32,390 --> 01:47:35,580
tell you that you're in a military state
with your trousers around your ankles,

2140
01:47:35,581 --> 01:47:40,581
with food or via face,
and yet you're in the deepest stages of 

2141
01:47:40,581 --> 01:47:42,030
non rem sleep and he's the guy who was 
working on people's eyes.

2142
01:47:42,200 --> 01:47:43,620
Yeah,
it's crazy.

2143
01:47:44,400 --> 01:47:45,230
Yeah.
I mean,

2144
01:47:45,630 --> 01:47:50,630
you know,
sleep is equally absent for the patient 

2145
01:47:50,630 --> 01:47:53,900
in the hospital setting.
We know that somewhere between 50 to 70 

2146
01:47:53,900 --> 01:47:58,671
percent of all icu alarms are either 
unnecessary or ignore rubble,

2147
01:48:00,860 --> 01:48:05,860
know,
and the one place where you desperately 

2148
01:48:05,860 --> 01:48:07,650
need the swiss army knife of health.
That is a good night of sleep is the one

2149
01:48:07,651 --> 01:48:10,260
place where you get at least,
which is on a hospital ward.

2150
01:48:10,440 --> 01:48:15,440
We could.
We could exit people out of hospital 

2151
01:48:15,440 --> 01:48:15,440
beds earlier.
The data is already there.

2152
01:48:15,440 --> 01:48:19,971
For the neonatal intensive care unit,
they used to leave bright lights on 24 

2153
01:48:19,971 --> 01:48:24,681
slash seven,
and that would prevent sort of the 

2154
01:48:24,681 --> 01:48:25,530
signaling for sleep and wake and sleep 
and wake,

2155
01:48:25,531 --> 01:48:28,980
and that cycle is critical if you 
regularize sleep,

2156
01:48:29,280 --> 01:48:29,550
sorry.

2157
01:48:29,550 --> 01:48:32,700
If you regularize the light in the 
neonatal intensive care unit,

2158
01:48:33,300 --> 01:48:37,320
those infants ended up having high 
levels of oxygen saturation because they

2159
01:48:37,321 --> 01:48:42,321
were sleeping better,
their weight gain was dramatically 

2160
01:48:42,321 --> 01:48:45,291
increased,
and they ended up exiting the neonatal 

2161
01:48:45,291 --> 01:48:46,740
intensive care unit five weeks earlier.
Whoa,

2162
01:48:46,830 --> 01:48:48,230
simple things.
You know,

2163
01:48:48,450 --> 01:48:50,910
why don't we do something like this in 
medicine?

2164
01:48:50,970 --> 01:48:55,560
When you come in onto a hospital ward,
you get this on an international flight,

2165
01:48:55,561 --> 01:48:57,390
travel for free,
earplugs,

2166
01:48:57,470 --> 01:49:02,470
facemask,
even just that by itself could help 

2167
01:49:02,470 --> 01:49:02,640
people to start,
get better sleep.

2168
01:49:02,940 --> 01:49:07,940
Next on the hospital admission form,
tell me when you normally go to sleep 

2169
01:49:07,940 --> 01:49:09,180
and when you normally wake up and to the
best of our ability,

2170
01:49:09,181 --> 01:49:14,181
we as doctors will try to sort of manage
your health care around your natural 

2171
01:49:15,601 --> 01:49:18,060
sleep tendencies.
If we could do that,

2172
01:49:18,390 --> 01:49:21,690
you know,
sleep is is the elixir of life.

2173
01:49:21,840 --> 01:49:26,840
It is the most widely available 
democratic and powerful healthcare 

2174
01:49:26,840 --> 01:49:31,320
system I could ever possibly imagine.
Why aren't we leveraging that and taking

2175
01:49:31,321 --> 01:49:36,321
it?
That's one of the greatest hacks that 

2176
01:49:36,321 --> 01:49:36,321
medicine could actually,
you know,

2177
01:49:36,321 --> 01:49:36,540
inflect a stunning.

2178
01:49:37,640 --> 01:49:42,080
How is this being received by doctors?
Are they reluctant to listen to you?

2179
01:49:42,140 --> 01:49:42,740
I mean,
what,

2180
01:49:42,750 --> 01:49:45,020
what,
what is happening with all this data and

2181
01:49:45,021 --> 01:49:48,100
you're,
you're passionate cry for extra

2182
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:52,570
sleep or more sleep or the proper sleep,
I should say it's starting to happen.

2183
01:49:52,571 --> 01:49:54,700
I mean,
when the book came out,

2184
01:49:54,701 --> 01:49:57,860
which is sort of the hub that came back,
I was in back in october and,

2185
01:49:58,210 --> 01:50:02,890
and some people started to give push 
back sort of in the medicine realm.

2186
01:50:03,190 --> 01:50:05,860
You know,
there was some concerns about continuity

2187
01:50:05,861 --> 01:50:09,250
of care that if you keep switching 
residents out every 16 hours,

2188
01:50:09,610 --> 01:50:11,920
that you wouldn't have continuous 
patient care.

2189
01:50:11,921 --> 01:50:13,490
And tHat was a problem.
Um,

2190
01:50:13,720 --> 01:50:16,360
well there are other medical training 
systems.

2191
01:50:16,570 --> 01:50:17,710
For example,
France,

2192
01:50:17,810 --> 01:50:18,970
Sweden,
New Zealand,

2193
01:50:19,180 --> 01:50:24,180
they do this all the time.
They do not allow their residents to 

2194
01:50:24,180 --> 01:50:27,190
undergo anything along the,
neither of 14 or a 16 hour shift.

2195
01:50:27,580 --> 01:50:31,060
They train their residents in the same 
amount of time or less,

2196
01:50:31,210 --> 01:50:35,140
and if you look at the rankings of their
medical health systems around the world,

2197
01:50:35,350 --> 01:50:37,840
they rank far higher than the United 
States,

2198
01:50:38,380 --> 01:50:42,520
so you can't tell me that longer work 
hours for residents,

2199
01:50:42,521 --> 01:50:45,370
for example,
unnecessary to train good doctors.

2200
01:50:45,730 --> 01:50:48,580
The evidence just isn't supportive,
so I've had some pushback there,

2201
01:50:49,270 --> 01:50:53,440
but for the most part I think people are
receptive once they know the information

2202
01:50:53,590 --> 01:50:58,590
and I think I'm the.
I've been someone who's been to blame 

2203
01:50:58,590 --> 01:50:59,710
here.
I've known this evidence for,

2204
01:50:59,750 --> 01:51:04,750
you know,
I've been doing sleep research now for 

2205
01:51:04,750 --> 01:51:06,630
20 or so years.
We are with sleep where we were with 

2206
01:51:06,630 --> 01:51:10,501
smoking 50 years ago.
We had all of the evidence about the 

2207
01:51:10,501 --> 01:51:11,980
deathly cost magenic cardiovascular 
disease issues,

2208
01:51:12,370 --> 01:51:17,370
but the public had not been a word.
No one had adequately communicated the 

2209
01:51:17,370 --> 01:51:21,931
science of smoking to the public.
The same I think is true for sleep right

2210
01:51:22,361 --> 01:51:27,361
now.
That's part of the motivation for why I 

2211
01:51:27,361 --> 01:51:30,001
wrote the book,
why I've been doing or trying to do a 

2212
01:51:30,001 --> 01:51:32,281
lot of publicity.
I'm a very shy person and I don't like 

2213
01:51:32,281 --> 01:51:35,461
being in the spotlight,
but I feel as though there is a mission 

2214
01:51:35,461 --> 01:51:38,821
that whose voice has not been actually 
gifted yet and I wanted to try and help 

2215
01:51:38,821 --> 01:51:40,000
him be a sort of asleep diplomat.

2216
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:41,940
I mean that's why I chose the handle on 
social media,

2217
01:51:42,160 --> 01:51:47,160
trying to be there as an ambassador for 
sleep and now once people start to 

2218
01:51:47,160 --> 01:51:49,330
understand the science as we've spoken 
about for two hours,

2219
01:51:49,930 --> 01:51:54,040
then people start to actually realize 
it's not the third pillar of good health

2220
01:51:54,041 --> 01:51:59,041
alongside diet and exercise.
It's the foundation on which those two 

2221
01:51:59,041 --> 01:51:59,400
are the things said,
you know,

2222
01:51:59,470 --> 01:52:02,500
for example,
if you're dieting but you're not getting

2223
01:52:02,501 --> 01:52:07,501
sufficient sleep,
70 percent of all the weight that you 

2224
01:52:07,501 --> 01:52:07,510
lose will come from lean body,
mass,

2225
01:52:07,511 --> 01:52:12,511
muscle and not fat.
Your body becomes stingy in giving up 

2226
01:52:12,511 --> 01:52:17,191
its fat when it's under slept,
so once you get this information out 

2227
01:52:17,191 --> 01:52:18,400
there,
things are starting to change.

2228
01:52:18,401 --> 01:52:21,940
I've started to have some discussions 
with the world health organization.

2229
01:52:21,941 --> 01:52:24,430
They seem to be very interested now in 
getting,

2230
01:52:24,580 --> 01:52:26,570
getting to grips with sleep.
I'd,

2231
01:52:26,790 --> 01:52:29,110
I'd love to speak to first world 
governments tHere.

2232
01:52:29,260 --> 01:52:34,240
When was the last time you saw any first
world nation have a government supported

2233
01:52:34,270 --> 01:52:38,410
public health campaign around sleep?
I don't know any.

2234
01:52:38,470 --> 01:52:42,430
We've had them for drink driving for 
risky behaviors,

2235
01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:44,230
for drugs,
for alcohol,

2236
01:52:44,231 --> 01:52:48,440
for healthy eating.
Sleep should be a part of that equation.

2237
01:52:48,700 --> 01:52:53,700
You know,
I want to lobby governments to start to 

2238
01:52:53,700 --> 01:52:54,290
instigate this and it will save them 
millions of dollars.

2239
01:52:54,320 --> 01:52:59,210
The rand corporation did an independent 
survey two years ago on the demonstrably

2240
01:52:59,230 --> 01:53:01,670
cost of a lack of sleep to global 
economies.

2241
01:53:01,910 --> 01:53:04,760
What they found was that a lack of sleep
cost most nations,

2242
01:53:04,761 --> 01:53:09,761
about two percent of their gdp,
the gross domestic product here in 

2243
01:53:09,761 --> 01:53:12,530
America,
that number was $411,000,000,000

2244
01:53:12,680 --> 01:53:16,040
caused by insufficient sleep.
Solve the sleepless epidemic.

2245
01:53:16,041 --> 01:53:21,041
You could almost double the budget for 
education and you could almost half the 

2246
01:53:21,041 --> 01:53:23,340
deficit for healthcare.
Wow.

2247
01:53:24,570 --> 01:53:25,770
What studies,
if any,

2248
01:53:25,771 --> 01:53:30,771
have been done on people who live in the
northern hemisphere where they 

2249
01:53:30,771 --> 01:53:33,240
experienced these long days like Alaska 
and

2250
01:53:34,110 --> 01:53:39,110
places like that.
It's really tough for the regulation of 

2251
01:53:39,110 --> 01:53:39,780
the circadian rhythm and what they.
A lot of people,

2252
01:53:39,781 --> 01:53:44,781
they're not all,
but a lot of people will suffer from 

2253
01:53:44,781 --> 01:53:44,781
what's called seasonal affective 
disorder,

2254
01:53:44,940 --> 01:53:46,690
which is the winter blues.
Yeah,

2255
01:53:46,740 --> 01:53:48,810
and you.
It's an unfortunate acronym.

2256
01:53:49,240 --> 01:53:50,400
Sad.
Dr.

2257
01:53:50,530 --> 01:53:51,690
Doctor comes along and you say,
look,

2258
01:53:51,691 --> 01:53:53,070
I'm not feeling good.
It's the wintertime.

2259
01:53:53,340 --> 01:53:54,210
Well,
you're sad.

2260
01:53:54,480 --> 01:53:55,490
No,
no,

2261
01:53:55,650 --> 01:53:56,370
no,
I'm sorry.

2262
01:53:56,371 --> 01:53:58,500
It's a medical term.
It's got sad seasonal.

2263
01:53:58,501 --> 01:54:00,480
If it's called seasonal affective 
disorder,

2264
01:54:00,750 --> 01:54:05,750
and that data is quite powerful too,
and you end up having to use melatonin 

2265
01:54:05,750 --> 01:54:10,281
strategically to help you fall asleep to
sort of signal darkness in the 

2266
01:54:10,281 --> 01:54:14,511
summertime when it's really liked or 
almost all day and then in the 

2267
01:54:14,511 --> 01:54:18,450
wintertime you reverse engineer the 
trick and in the morning you sit and you

2268
01:54:18,451 --> 01:54:23,451
have your breakfast or you're working at
your terminal and you have one of these 

2269
01:54:23,451 --> 01:54:26,151
big light boxes that sits next to you.
Strong looks power light to try and sort

2270
01:54:26,581 --> 01:54:31,581
of fool your brain into thinking that 
you're getting a lot of daylight when 

2271
01:54:31,581 --> 01:54:31,581
it's,
you know,

2272
01:54:31,581 --> 01:54:33,060
it's not going to be light for the next 
four hours.

2273
01:54:33,270 --> 01:54:38,270
So they have to undergo treatment.
Do they have to do vitamin d 

2274
01:54:38,270 --> 01:54:38,430
supplementation as well?
Some of that too.

2275
01:54:38,431 --> 01:54:43,431
Yeah.
BecaUse of lack of exposure for the 

2276
01:54:43,431 --> 01:54:43,431
skin.
Why do uv light?

2277
01:54:43,431 --> 01:54:44,050
Listen man,
you,

2278
01:54:44,110 --> 01:54:46,270
I think you just open up a lot of 
people's minds.

2279
01:54:46,271 --> 01:54:50,020
You certainly did mind.
You mean this podcast blew me away.

2280
01:54:50,050 --> 01:54:52,810
I thought I knew a little bit about 
sleep.

2281
01:54:53,200 --> 01:54:56,110
I knew nothing.
Thank you so much.

2282
01:54:56,330 --> 01:55:01,330
Very welcome.
tell people how they could read your 

2283
01:55:01,330 --> 01:55:01,330
book.
Where can they get it?

2284
01:55:01,330 --> 01:55:01,990
What's your website?

2285
01:55:02,560 --> 01:55:05,140
Yes.
So I'm all over social media and the web

2286
01:55:05,710 --> 01:55:10,710
pages.com
and the book is called why we sleep,

2287
01:55:12,610 --> 01:55:17,610
uh,
and it is out now on amazon and all 

2288
01:55:17,610 --> 01:55:20,191
major book sellers and that's probably 
the best way that they can learn all 

2289
01:55:20,191 --> 01:55:20,980
about sleep and frightening the living 
daylights.

2290
01:55:21,670 --> 01:55:23,140
Thank you so much matt.
I really,

2291
01:55:23,141 --> 01:55:25,060
really appreciate you last sleep.
Well,

2292
01:55:25,120 --> 01:55:26,380
thank you.
You too.

2293
01:55:26,560 --> 01:55:26,900
Thanks.
