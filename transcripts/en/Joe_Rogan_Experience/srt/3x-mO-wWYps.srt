1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,650
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,090
Kevin just gave me a heart
attack and he did his name,

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:04,800
realize it.

4
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,830
What way and what was I talking
about it all that life thing.

5
00:00:07,831 --> 00:00:10,170
I almost died a Friday night.

6
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:11,081
I,

7
00:00:11,081 --> 00:00:11,700
uh,

8
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:12,570
was out in,

9
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,553
just told me and I'm like,

10
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:14,653
uh,

11
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:18,000
I was at a karaoke bar in Burbank
right across the street from a,

12
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:18,900
the Jay Leno show,

13
00:00:18,901 --> 00:00:21,330
like the NBC building temples.

14
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:22,021
I've see,

15
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:22,231
I've,

16
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:22,441
see,

17
00:00:22,441 --> 00:00:23,400
I drive past that.

18
00:00:23,401 --> 00:00:24,240
I've seen that place.

19
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,110
I came out,

20
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:28,740
me and my girlfriend around 1130 and
we walking out the front and we parked.

21
00:00:28,741 --> 00:00:31,710
So I'm opening the door for her
to get in Avondale where this big,

22
00:00:31,711 --> 00:00:32,760
tall black guy,

23
00:00:32,761 --> 00:00:35,820
about six to wearing a fake gray beard,

24
00:00:35,821 --> 00:00:39,690
like a Santa Claus beard that was like
tied on with white strings and a hat in

25
00:00:39,691 --> 00:00:43,650
this big Hobo jacket shows a
gun in my chest and was like,

26
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,910
give me your fucking wallet.

27
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:45,420
Oh man,

28
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:45,870
you're harsher.

29
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:46,410
My boss.

30
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:46,651
Yeah.

31
00:00:46,651 --> 00:00:48,240
And they keep going.

32
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:50,573
And then my girlfriend,

33
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:51,570
my girlfriend was,

34
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:53,280
my girlfriend was pretty drunk.

35
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,041
That's good.

36
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:57,390
Here's my girlfriend was pretty drunk,

37
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:58,070
so because,

38
00:00:58,070 --> 00:00:58,290
uh,

39
00:00:58,290 --> 00:00:59,790
she has like social anxiety,

40
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:00,391
so she drinks,

41
00:01:00,391 --> 00:01:00,601
you know,

42
00:01:00,601 --> 00:01:01,434
when she goes out,

43
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:03,150
she thought it was a joke.

44
00:01:03,151 --> 00:01:05,520
She looked over and thought this
was like a character or something.

45
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:06,420
Right.

46
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:07,240
And so he's like,

47
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:07,741
do shit,

48
00:01:07,741 --> 00:01:09,180
you're shaking him can tell.

49
00:01:09,181 --> 00:01:10,610
It's still fun fucking night.

50
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:11,371
That would fuck me up.

51
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:11,821
Keep going.

52
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:12,540
And so he said,

53
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:12,870
uh,

54
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:13,411
he said,

55
00:01:13,411 --> 00:01:14,130
um,

56
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:14,371
you know,

57
00:01:14,371 --> 00:01:15,840
give me your fucking purse bitch.

58
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:16,591
And she just like,

59
00:01:16,591 --> 00:01:18,450
like looking at like what?

60
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,910
Like she was drunk and
shocked and I'm like,

61
00:01:20,911 --> 00:01:21,220
give her,

62
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:21,961
give him the person.

63
00:01:21,961 --> 00:01:24,660
So I get gave her or she gave
him the purse and then he goes,

64
00:01:24,661 --> 00:01:25,500
get in the car,

65
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,880
lay on your fucking stomach.

66
00:01:26,881 --> 00:01:29,460
And he's shoving the gun in my
back while I'm laying in the car.

67
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:30,151
And I'm thinking like,

68
00:01:30,151 --> 00:01:30,361
all right,

69
00:01:30,361 --> 00:01:31,770
this is like execution style.

70
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:32,570
Like he's telling me,

71
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:32,821
you know,

72
00:01:32,821 --> 00:01:34,500
get in there and then suddenly he goes,

73
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:35,490
get laid down to the,

74
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:36,271
to my girlfriend.

75
00:01:36,271 --> 00:01:39,360
And she laid down on her back
because she was just so freaked out.

76
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:39,990
He said,

77
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,940
I said later on your
fucking stomach bitch.

78
00:01:41,941 --> 00:01:42,311
And he's like,

79
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:44,280
it's just shoving a gun in her back.

80
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:48,030
And then finally just like both laying
there and then he slams the door and then

81
00:01:48,031 --> 00:01:48,870
just takes off.

82
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,040
And so now,

83
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,070
like the other day I was at the grocery
store and I saw a black guy that was

84
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:54,660
tall and I'm now I'm like freaking out.

85
00:01:54,661 --> 00:01:57,330
Like if it was a redhead that robbed
me would have been the same way.

86
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:00,900
But now I see these guys and I'm like
becoming like a racist from the 50s now

87
00:02:00,901 --> 00:02:03,510
where I'm like walking around like
what's he doing on my side of the store?

88
00:02:03,511 --> 00:02:05,310
You know like it's great.

89
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,230
It's like at this point you had your,

90
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,730
you were in that moment.

91
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:09,653
Yeah.

92
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,470
What did you,

93
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,400
what was it like?

94
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,510
It was really when I was laying there
and it was like this is it and you think

95
00:02:15,511 --> 00:02:16,260
that,

96
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:16,981
what did you think?

97
00:02:16,981 --> 00:02:17,251
You know,

98
00:02:17,251 --> 00:02:19,310
I didn't think about anything
except my girlfriend the whole time.

99
00:02:19,311 --> 00:02:19,650
And I'm like,

100
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:21,840
cause hearing him yell at her,

101
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,340
that's just you.

102
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,070
You think that you can just going to
look around and look for a weapon or

103
00:02:26,071 --> 00:02:26,581
something like that,

104
00:02:26,581 --> 00:02:28,290
but when you're in that biggest shock,

105
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:28,920
you're just like,

106
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,071
oh,

107
00:02:29,071 --> 00:02:30,130
I wouldn't look to fence lines,

108
00:02:30,131 --> 00:02:32,220
so not the butch do that again.

109
00:02:32,221 --> 00:02:32,870
There's that word.

110
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,470
I am showing up the dude that's like,

111
00:02:34,471 --> 00:02:35,161
where's a weapon?

112
00:02:35,161 --> 00:02:35,994
I'm going to do this.

113
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,021
My immediate,

114
00:02:37,021 --> 00:02:38,400
my reaction is going to be like,

115
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,480
let me suck your Dick.

116
00:02:39,481 --> 00:02:40,290
Let us go.

117
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:41,940
I will suck your Dick until you let us go.

118
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:42,301
And he's like,

119
00:02:42,301 --> 00:02:43,320
you've got a girlfriend.

120
00:02:43,321 --> 00:02:43,591
I'm like,

121
00:02:43,591 --> 00:02:44,230
still,

122
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,360
I'll be better than her.

123
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:45,780
Yeah,

124
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,830
I can really deliver.

125
00:02:46,831 --> 00:02:46,951
I,

126
00:02:46,951 --> 00:02:48,060
that's where I go with it.

127
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:50,200
I would never go defensive or office.

128
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,030
All these people online.

129
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:51,670
Of course I was like,

130
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,280
what'd you give for not doing Jujitsu?

131
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,830
If I had two guns in my pocket,

132
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:59,860
I still [inaudible] you add
yourself strapped the dynamite,

133
00:02:59,861 --> 00:03:01,750
maybe then you can be a
little look at this bitch,

134
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:02,250
right?

135
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:02,500
Yeah.

136
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,480
People are those you should have,

137
00:03:04,481 --> 00:03:06,010
people should shut the fuck up.

138
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:08,590
No one knows what that's like
until that happens to you.

139
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,530
And you should always give
someone what they want.

140
00:03:11,531 --> 00:03:13,750
Usually they just want to fucking
get your money and run away.

141
00:03:13,751 --> 00:03:14,620
They don't want to shoot you.

142
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:15,610
Is that the case?

143
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,590
Usually hear right once in a while though,

144
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:18,060
like,

145
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,020
like Old Lady,

146
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:19,291
you know,

147
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:21,470
did nothing still gets shot
or something like that.

148
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,690
So if it's a young kid on fucking PCP,

149
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:25,993
it's really a gamble.

150
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,380
This is in Burbank.

151
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:33,000
And then time where you believing about
midnight and three months before that or

152
00:03:33,001 --> 00:03:36,660
six months before that I was in
Fuddruckers in Burbank and some guys like

153
00:03:36,661 --> 00:03:39,240
stealing this girl's person running
out the door and I'm chasing him.

154
00:03:39,241 --> 00:03:39,750
I'm like,

155
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,980
I'm in Burbank right now.

156
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:41,540
Why?

157
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,373
You know,

158
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:43,740
and we talked about,

159
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,070
uh,

160
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:46,410
the Kmart shooting in one podcast,

161
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:46,621
the,

162
00:03:46,621 --> 00:03:47,020
the,

163
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:47,521
the,

164
00:03:47,521 --> 00:03:49,830
there was a shooting at Kmart in Burbank.

165
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:54,170
And the officer that got shot was
the one that came to rescue me when,

166
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:54,460
uh,

167
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,080
the other night.

168
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:55,920
And I was like,

169
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:56,540
you're the,

170
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:57,390
you're the one officer.

171
00:03:57,391 --> 00:03:57,670
And he's like,

172
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:58,330
yeah,

173
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:01,320
I got shot in the leg and stuff like that.

174
00:04:01,321 --> 00:04:02,830
And so he became like a celebrity guy.

175
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,050
Well,

176
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:06,170
he's been shot at in Burbank and,

177
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:07,380
and Kmarts like,

178
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,390
you know [inaudible] he saw
him on TV like they showed us.

179
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:11,700
But,

180
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,271
but it's like,

181
00:04:12,271 --> 00:04:12,601
it's like,

182
00:04:12,601 --> 00:04:14,640
it seems like you always
hear Burbank is so sad.

183
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:15,480
Yeah.

184
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:15,660
You'll,

185
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,380
you don't think of Burbank is
like Bob hope and live there.

186
00:04:18,381 --> 00:04:20,330
How could it be right
there could be no terror.

187
00:04:20,331 --> 00:04:21,164
Well Toluca Lake,

188
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,480
I wonder how many checks
one of bone that guy,

189
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,880
because he's the straight
celebrity cop that got shot.

190
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:26,410
Well,

191
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:27,290
I had to wait a bunch,

192
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:27,680
right?

193
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,460
Gotta be right.

194
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,293
Fuck yeah.

195
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,190
Fuck fat dude.

196
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,980
Gotta be chicks that wanna
fuck fucking hero cop.

197
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,480
He wrote cop that got shot in the leg.

198
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:39,140
I bet that guy gets beaten off the
pussy just waiting for forensics.

199
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,880
Like I had to wait like
four hours because,

200
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:41,061
I mean,

201
00:04:41,061 --> 00:04:41,451
this is like,

202
00:04:41,451 --> 00:04:44,060
they closed off helicopters and everything
that was at cops and stuff and then

203
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,340
they wanted a fingerprint,

204
00:04:46,341 --> 00:04:46,791
my car.

205
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:48,920
So I'm just sitting there
and he's like going,

206
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:51,620
asking my girlfriend like
questions like weird questions.

207
00:04:51,621 --> 00:04:51,861
Like,

208
00:04:51,861 --> 00:04:52,670
so what do you do?

209
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:52,821
Oh,

210
00:04:52,821 --> 00:04:53,540
you're like dance at,

211
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:53,880
Huh?

212
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,530
Yo Yo,

213
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:54,801
you ain't,

214
00:04:54,801 --> 00:04:55,634
and stuff like it was,

215
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:56,850
no,

216
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:58,190
he was totally an awesome,

217
00:04:58,191 --> 00:04:58,731
nice cop.

218
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:01,950
But it was kind of weird like hearing
like my girlfriend having to talk like it

219
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,990
was an exotic dancer.

220
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:03,500
No,

221
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:07,670
but just asking weird questions and then
it was easy going as close to hitting

222
00:05:07,671 --> 00:05:09,950
on her as he could and
still remaining a cop.

223
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:10,993
What's he doing?

224
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,320
Ain't with this guy.

225
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:16,431
I don't know.

226
00:05:16,431 --> 00:05:17,930
If you see me and they see my girlfriend,

227
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,910
maybe he thought I paid for her,

228
00:05:19,911 --> 00:05:21,260
like if she was a hooker or something,

229
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:22,011
you know,

230
00:05:22,011 --> 00:05:23,420
like how long do you know this guy?

231
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,560
You've got it

232
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:28,240
exactly in Brian Flux.

233
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,083
Way over his head.

234
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:29,810
But,

235
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:30,680
but what's weird is,

236
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:31,791
I don't even know what,

237
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:32,330
it's weird.

238
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:32,481
Oh,

239
00:05:32,481 --> 00:05:33,071
but we're just saying,

240
00:05:33,071 --> 00:05:35,000
he was talking to me and asking me
all these questions and he goes,

241
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:35,390
well,

242
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:35,901
and I was like,

243
00:05:35,901 --> 00:05:36,081
yeah,

244
00:05:36,081 --> 00:05:36,861
I would like to be a cop,

245
00:05:36,861 --> 00:05:38,330
but I like marijuana too much.

246
00:05:38,331 --> 00:05:38,631
And he goes,

247
00:05:38,631 --> 00:05:38,990
yeah,

248
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,520
I see that know marijuana.

249
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,031
And he's like,

250
00:05:41,031 --> 00:05:41,811
it's gonna be legal soon.

251
00:05:41,811 --> 00:05:42,644
So don't worry about that.

252
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:43,941
And I was like,

253
00:05:43,941 --> 00:05:44,130
all right,

254
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:45,680
just office Korea.

255
00:05:45,681 --> 00:05:47,780
I don't know if he's got
a fucking crystal ball.

256
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,673
Yeah,

257
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:49,191
come on,

258
00:05:49,191 --> 00:05:49,521
man.

259
00:05:49,521 --> 00:05:50,070
Come on.

260
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:54,620
I was the only silver lining to that
horrible story was like at the end of it,

261
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:55,401
the cop was like,

262
00:05:55,401 --> 00:05:55,791
don't worry,

263
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:56,091
kid.

264
00:05:56,091 --> 00:05:57,770
One day it's going to be leaving now.

265
00:05:57,771 --> 00:05:59,210
I'm scared of black wizards.

266
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,493
Wizards,

267
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:03,890
wizard.

268
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:04,723
It's the screen.

269
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,800
Let's get it going to be an Internet meme.

270
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,080
My friend black wizards.

271
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,630
You're scared of monsters,

272
00:06:11,631 --> 00:06:12,650
you know like smoking.

273
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,480
[inaudible] scared of werewolves,

274
00:06:14,481 --> 00:06:14,810
Bro.

275
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:15,643
I love you.

276
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,200
I'm scared of Jaguars and pants.

277
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:18,870
Did you see one?

278
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:19,520
A monster?

279
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,091
You see the video?

280
00:06:20,091 --> 00:06:22,880
I tweeted the other day of a
Jaguar killing a fucking crocodile.

281
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:23,743
Yes.

282
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,550
[inaudible]

283
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:33,270
okay.
