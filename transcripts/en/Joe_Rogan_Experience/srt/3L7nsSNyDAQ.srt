1
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,320
No bells and whistles.
We got snowed guests,

2
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:26,180
we're God's shit.
This is the hundredth episode and it

3
00:00:26,181 --> 00:00:31,181
will go to 100 the way it began with no
form not knowing what the fuck we're

4
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,090
doing sitting in front of a laptop with
snow.

5
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:39,400
This stupid Karaoke Snell effect.
Yeah,

6
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:43,090
I listened to it today actually on the
way over here it's unlistenable there.

7
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,230
There is times where there was like 15
seconds,

8
00:00:45,231 --> 00:00:48,440
20 seconds of dead air where we're just
fucking sitting there like looking at

9
00:00:48,441 --> 00:00:49,274
things.
Yeah.

10
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:51,680
That wasn't really supposed to be on
iTunes.

11
00:00:51,681 --> 00:00:53,590
We should've never let it go on iTunes.
Yeah,

12
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:54,740
what it is,
you know,

13
00:00:54,741 --> 00:00:56,260
it was just,
we were just fucking around.

14
00:00:56,261 --> 00:00:57,220
We just,
what did,

15
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,120
what started,
was it Anthony [inaudible] show?

16
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:02,390
I remember a while ago when Justin TV
came out,

17
00:01:02,391 --> 00:01:05,630
we used to always be on the road in the
greenroom and I always tried to like set

18
00:01:05,631 --> 00:01:07,850
up like a video,
like in the green room thing.

19
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:11,150
We did it a few times at Joey Diaz and
then Jody has got pissed and twisted my

20
00:01:11,151 --> 00:01:13,820
finger.
I remember that he got mad cause you

21
00:01:13,821 --> 00:01:16,850
didn't want the camera on anymore.
And he grabbed my hand and started

22
00:01:16,851 --> 00:01:18,170
twisting my finger.
It was crazy.

23
00:01:18,171 --> 00:01:19,590
Like he got really upset.
Joey.

24
00:01:19,591 --> 00:01:23,570
I think Joey has to be funny all the
time and his eyes and when Joey's

25
00:01:23,571 --> 00:01:25,340
backstage,
if he's just sitting there like,

26
00:01:25,341 --> 00:01:26,240
what?
What do you want to do?

27
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,150
Well I'm not even hungry.
And now he doesn't want people to see

28
00:01:29,151 --> 00:01:30,200
that,
you know,

29
00:01:30,201 --> 00:01:33,770
he doesn't want people to see the normal
average everyday Joe.

30
00:01:33,771 --> 00:01:35,720
He just wants Joey when he's on.
Right.

31
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:36,620
You know?
So yeah,

32
00:01:36,621 --> 00:01:37,401
after that,
that,

33
00:01:37,401 --> 00:01:38,300
that incident,
I was like,

34
00:01:38,301 --> 00:01:39,410
all right,
I'm not doing this anymore.

35
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,120
And then we try to,
again,

36
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,950
Joey's a lot more sensitive than you
think he has.

37
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:43,700
Man.
You know,

38
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,460
Joey,
Joey said something to me.

39
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:47,040
I remember when I came down,
when I,

40
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:49,580
when we were headed to the show in
Portland and Joey got mad.

41
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,860
Yeah.
That was ridiculous.

42
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,340
That came out of nowhere too.
It was just me and him sitting there

43
00:01:55,341 --> 00:01:57,380
waiting for you to come down.
And it's really weird.

44
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,210
I mean,
the bottom line was I had to take a

45
00:01:59,211 --> 00:02:01,300
shit.
And sometimes who's that,

46
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,950
Amelia?
It's probably,

47
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:06,500
it's probably me.
You know when you have to tell you shit

48
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:09,050
sometimes you all the time it,
well sometimes like you're running out

49
00:02:09,051 --> 00:02:09,620
the door.
I'm like,

50
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,030
God damn,
I think I got to go.

51
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:12,920
Let me just see if I can get it out real
quick.

52
00:02:12,921 --> 00:02:14,350
And I was like,
Eh.

53
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,660
Oh my God.
Dammit.

54
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,210
I do have to take a shit,
but I,

55
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,450
I haven't had enough lettuce today.
I hate that.

56
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:24,540
That when you have to speed up a shit
that's the worst,

57
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:25,760
that's not cool at all.
That healthy.

58
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:29,030
The worst is when you thinking about not
taking a shit and then you do and you

59
00:02:29,031 --> 00:02:29,541
go,
God,

60
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:32,300
I can't believe I was just going to walk
around for the next couple hours of that

61
00:02:32,301 --> 00:02:35,860
inside of me or the girlfriend share
where you get a new girlfriend,

62
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,210
he can't shit in front of her or shit in
front of everybody.

63
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,460
You gotta deal with it.
Yeah.

64
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:41,810
I don't mind if they do it either.
It's life.

65
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,260
Yeah.
But it's just kind of stuck to you.

66
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,260
You just meet this girl.
You're trying to be like all sexy and

67
00:02:45,261 --> 00:02:48,430
hot and your bathroom's right next to
your telemedicine has deal.

68
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,050
I'm going to go take a stinky shit.
Hope you can deal with it.

69
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,870
If you're not,
you don't get no more of this good deck.

70
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,930
That's where you gotta tell her,
let her know it's a commodity.

71
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:59,000
You didn't look through my camera by the
way that I left it.

72
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:02,050
I did not our God dammit that's not,
and if I did,

73
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:03,430
I wouldn't know what I mean.
I,

74
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,680
I did my first,
well not my first,

75
00:03:05,681 --> 00:03:09,310
but my one or first or second,
it's a home movie sex movie.

76
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,320
And we were just like,
let's see what it looks like.

77
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:13,240
You like how you know?
Because it was,

78
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:17,860
it was a side profile and I noticed that
my gut just kind of sits on her ass when

79
00:03:17,861 --> 00:03:20,470
I'm talking to her.
I've never noticed that before.

80
00:03:20,471 --> 00:03:22,720
So now I'm like looking at 24 hour
fitness and shit like that.

81
00:03:22,721 --> 00:03:25,570
But I left my rests on her ass like a
fanny pack.

82
00:03:25,571 --> 00:03:26,620
Yeah,
it was crazy.

83
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:29,110
And I left it here though and
immediately I saw him like,

84
00:03:29,111 --> 00:03:32,080
oh my God,
that video could easily have just gotten

85
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:34,780
out and that could have fucking,
that's how it happens.

86
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,021
It happens.
Yeah.

87
00:03:36,021 --> 00:03:37,540
Yeah.
You fuck around and leave a phone

88
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:38,650
behind.
Exactly.

89
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,720
Yeah.
Jason Tebow has this thing with Sam Aaa.

90
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,860
Every time they leave their phone around
or somebody gets their phone in,

91
00:03:44,861 --> 00:03:46,730
it's unlocked.
Take pictures of yeah.

92
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,150
Or put like black dicks and stuff like
that.

93
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,760
Like Jason Likes Black Dick and less,
uh,

94
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:52,660
last night,
uh,

95
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:56,730
Jason's did his mom though and was I
like Black Dick?

96
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,650
I did his mom.
What do you mean she left?

97
00:03:59,651 --> 00:04:00,111
She was like,
Oh,

98
00:04:00,111 --> 00:04:03,580
and look at these photos I took.
And so he did his mom's Facebook and put

99
00:04:03,581 --> 00:04:06,820
like his mom left her phone behind.
Yeah.

100
00:04:06,821 --> 00:04:10,180
So he took her phone and go on Facebook
and put pictures of black dude.

101
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:10,581
Yeah,
it's,

102
00:04:10,581 --> 00:04:11,860
it's,
or I know he put black Dicks,

103
00:04:11,861 --> 00:04:14,260
but he said something like,
I really like black muff or something

104
00:04:14,261 --> 00:04:15,370
like that.
Whoa.

105
00:04:15,371 --> 00:04:16,940
Really?
Yeah.

106
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,940
Yeah.
Here's his mom's pretty sweet though.

107
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:20,020
She's,
she's pretty sweet.

108
00:04:20,021 --> 00:04:20,441
She,
she's,

109
00:04:20,441 --> 00:04:21,460
she's,
she's a lesbian.

110
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:23,770
She just hangs out with the boys type
thing.

111
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,200
It was pretty sweet.
You saw like cart man,

112
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:33,610
his mom is pretty sweet.
I had one friend that had a mama who was

113
00:04:33,611 --> 00:04:35,650
a lesbian growing up,
but he never admitted it.

114
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:39,070
Man took forever.
Took forever before he came clean.

115
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:40,300
Oh,
he knew about it and you just,

116
00:04:40,301 --> 00:04:43,930
what he knew his mom was living with
this woman with a crew cut with,

117
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,880
with like big arms.
She had like,

118
00:04:45,881 --> 00:04:47,620
she would wear Larry the cable guy
clothes.

119
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,420
Yeah.
She would wear like sleeveless shirts,

120
00:04:49,421 --> 00:04:50,980
like sleeveless vest and shit.
Yeah.

121
00:04:50,981 --> 00:04:54,280
And she had these like these big floppy
truck driver arms,

122
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:55,421
you know,
and she was,

123
00:04:55,421 --> 00:04:57,460
she was a dyke and there's no getting
around it.

124
00:04:57,461 --> 00:04:58,930
She was much was,
you know,

125
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,880
my friend did not want to come clean
though.

126
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,740
Why?
I so want to be normal,

127
00:05:02,741 --> 00:05:04,300
man.
Everybody wants to be normal.

128
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,910
You remember Joey Diaz or stories about
wanting to be a white kid?

129
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,980
Yeah,
he's not white.

130
00:05:08,981 --> 00:05:09,850
That's right.
Well he,

131
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:12,550
I mean that's kind of ridiculous.
That's called a slurp.

132
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,540
People go,
I hate him.

133
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:16,240
You make that slurping noise,
can't you turn your microphone up?

134
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,130
Just fucking deal with it,
man.

135
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,140
When I was listening to episode number
one in the car,

136
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:22,870
that was another thing that the mic
sucks so bad.

137
00:05:22,871 --> 00:05:26,050
There was parts where things were
dropping and just blew your speakers out

138
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,550
like that.
So that's pretty annoying.

139
00:05:27,551 --> 00:05:29,650
You know,
one thing I didn't know is a lot of

140
00:05:29,651 --> 00:05:30,460
people,
you know,

141
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,570
say why you stitcher.
I had no idea.

142
00:05:32,571 --> 00:05:35,170
So I talked to the president recently
when we were talking about the whole

143
00:05:35,171 --> 00:05:37,200
incident and stuff like that.
The incidence,

144
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,870
the RSS incident,
we had a beer and now he said a lot of

145
00:05:40,871 --> 00:05:42,250
things that I had no idea that stitcher
did.

146
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,950
And one thing was that stitcher
normalizes the whole audio.

147
00:05:44,951 --> 00:05:47,530
So when there's big loud burst and stuff
like that,

148
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,840
which is what we should be doing,
we should be doing,

149
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,080
we actually used to do that.
Uh,

150
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:54,990
um,
but it made the audio too quiet because

151
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,260
if for some reason,
I don't know,

152
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:57,123
you don't,
I'm not an audio,

153
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,490
but it didn't work.
Right.

154
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,960
Yeah,
we need compression.

155
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,240
I heard that compression was actually
not the way to go though.

156
00:06:02,241 --> 00:06:05,150
A lot of audio engineers that work at
radio stations here in La actually told

157
00:06:05,151 --> 00:06:08,150
me that that's not the way to go is to
uh,

158
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:11,190
to use software post.
But who knows host.

159
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:11,630
Yeah.
Yeah.

160
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:14,180
But then you have to edit it.
You have to put it through posts before.

161
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,460
Well,
I think it's just a plugin in what the

162
00:06:16,461 --> 00:06:19,070
program I use,
which is logic and it automatically just

163
00:06:19,071 --> 00:06:20,270
does that.
Right.

164
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,640
But you have to run it through the
program and you can't do it live.

165
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,500
Right.
They're doing it live.

166
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,550
Yeah.
They're doing it live.

167
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,020
And I guess was written by saying there,

168
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:30,030
talking about the Adam Carolla show,
I have podcast envy.

169
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,250
I went to his setup.
It's so dope he's got,

170
00:06:32,251 --> 00:06:36,330
I mean there's something cool about,
you and I are just chilling in my

171
00:06:36,331 --> 00:06:38,550
office.
We always do it this way and it's either

172
00:06:38,551 --> 00:06:40,120
in your office or in my office.
Right.

173
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:41,880
That's what we're doing.
There's something cool about that,

174
00:06:41,881 --> 00:06:44,100
but his is set up is pretty fucking
sweet.

175
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,980
Yeah.
Except that you doing a radio show,

176
00:06:45,981 --> 00:06:49,510
you actually got this one of the same
mix that you use as I guess Mark Marin

177
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,220
and him both use and we tried it out and
didn't sound as good.

178
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:57,430
Well ours is a lot louder,
but I think a part of that is the show

179
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,590
is a little more unstructured.
So there's people leaning back and

180
00:07:00,591 --> 00:07:03,170
yelling and stuff like that.
It's not really any of that going on in

181
00:07:03,171 --> 00:07:06,080
Marin show and there's not really any of
that going on the Kroll show,

182
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,380
you know,
I think for our purposes these are

183
00:07:09,381 --> 00:07:09,910
better.

184
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:12,490
Do you listen to any podcasts besides,
you know,

185
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,900
or do you just kind of here and there?

186
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:17,120
Oh listen to this info.
I listened to psychedelic salon.

187
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:19,790
Psychedelic salon is kind of cool
because it's a podcast,

188
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:22,340
but really it's a bunch of old audio
recordings,

189
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:25,130
like old Terence Mckenna recordings or
you know,

190
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,620
stuff like that.
So I listened to that stuff.

191
00:07:27,621 --> 00:07:32,621
But honestly I tried to listen to the
news or I listened to talk radio for two

192
00:07:33,621 --> 00:07:34,371
reasons.
One,

193
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:35,990
you know,
to see if there's anybody that I agree

194
00:07:35,991 --> 00:07:38,600
with and two,
to see if there's anybody that's just

195
00:07:38,601 --> 00:07:43,070
completely out to lunch.
Like I listened at Patriot on Sirius

196
00:07:43,071 --> 00:07:45,800
satellite radio.
The reason why we're listening to it,

197
00:07:45,801 --> 00:07:47,990
it's just,
it's all fucking bananas.

198
00:07:47,991 --> 00:07:51,350
It's all these crazy assholes that want
to Barrick gold and they're ready for

199
00:07:51,351 --> 00:07:53,980
the whole thing to come tumbling down.
They got their guns ready and this will

200
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,420
bomb on what he's trying to do with
niche.

201
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,080
Eric Andre,
you know to those guys,

202
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:58,190
you don't fall for that shit.
They,

203
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,980
that doesn't get in the back of your
head like,

204
00:07:59,981 --> 00:08:00,791
oh my God,
you're right.

205
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:03,070
We need to collect gold and no,
you don't.

206
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:03,710
You don't follow her.

207
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:04,430
Come on,
man.

208
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:07,550
I think if the shit hits the fan,
Gold's not what we're going to need.

209
00:08:07,551 --> 00:08:09,250
We're going to make bullets and
gasoline.

210
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,550
That's what I think.
Bullets,

211
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,140
gasoline,
guns,

212
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,050
places to stay,
somewhere to go where there's no

213
00:08:15,051 --> 00:08:17,240
radiation.
When the shit hits the fan,

214
00:08:17,241 --> 00:08:19,550
there's so many human beings have
device,

215
00:08:19,551 --> 00:08:24,220
so many ways to fuck each other up.
That if something ever really Keanna cap

216
00:08:24,221 --> 00:08:27,830
and at this point in time where we
really went into like nuclear warfare,

217
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,830
man,
the golden going to help you dog

218
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,560
every time I'm away from La,
this is the reasonable,

219
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:37,120
one of the things that maybe we should
leave la someday because every time I'm

220
00:08:37,121 --> 00:08:39,250
away from La,
like I was out of town this weekend when

221
00:08:39,251 --> 00:08:41,320
I was away I was like,
now's a good time.

222
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:43,990
If Shit was to happen,
this would be a good time because I'm

223
00:08:43,991 --> 00:08:47,020
kind of out of the crowd.
I could escape easier,

224
00:08:47,021 --> 00:08:48,130
you know,
cause there's not a whole bunch of

225
00:08:48,131 --> 00:08:53,020
traffic and soul vein and like I think I
have like a whole suitcase of shit.

226
00:08:53,021 --> 00:08:56,100
I have my computers and stuff.
I think at a certain

227
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,430
point in time it becomes completely
unnecessary to be in such a large group

228
00:08:59,431 --> 00:09:02,250
of people.
The only benefit of it is that because

229
00:09:02,251 --> 00:09:04,500
there's so many people you're going to
get.

230
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,650
And especially because it's such a,
like a desired area.

231
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:09,630
You get a lot of fascinating people
here.

232
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:12,150
Yeah.
And like if you moved to Denver,

233
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:13,560
like what are you gonna do with the
podcast flight?

234
00:09:13,561 --> 00:09:17,630
Freddy Lockhart out on a plane
I think

235
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:21,360
could do is there's three comedy clubs
in Denver.

236
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,180
There's two comedy works and there's one
a Improv.

237
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:26,280
I could talk to the people that are
coming in for that.

238
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,590
I can interview them.
Make it like a radio show kind of.

239
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,760
Yeah,
there's local comics.

240
00:09:29,761 --> 00:09:34,560
There's a strong local comic scene in
Denver so I could always like have those

241
00:09:34,561 --> 00:09:38,070
guys come on and we could do Skype too.
I did an Ariel Helwani,

242
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,890
his MMA show.
I did it yesterday and I did it through

243
00:09:40,891 --> 00:09:42,660
Skype.
It's pretty bad ass man.

244
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:45,180
How did it sound?
It sounds he sounds great.

245
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:48,630
I use that stupid snow snowball
microphone.

246
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:51,930
The only thing that's kind of fucked
though is that you can't hear your own

247
00:09:51,931 --> 00:09:53,310
voice.
Right.

248
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:55,440
I'm still waiting to set it up that you
could definitely,

249
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:58,190
you could use these mics as an example.
Yeah.

250
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,680
And if I had it set up like this,
like in like if I had it set up like

251
00:10:01,681 --> 00:10:04,740
this in Colorado and you had it set up
like this in California and we just

252
00:10:04,741 --> 00:10:07,260
skyped it together,
we could do a podcast,

253
00:10:07,261 --> 00:10:09,810
it'd be pretty easy.
But then once I show you how sweet

254
00:10:09,811 --> 00:10:11,630
Colorado as you're going to want to move
to yeah.

255
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:14,160
Yeah.
But there's not as many of your type of

256
00:10:14,161 --> 00:10:14,994
girls out there.

257
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,800
Yeah.
You'd have to change your standards.

258
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:20,060
Yeah,
I think it,

259
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,670
yeah.
I don't know that I'm,

260
00:10:22,671 --> 00:10:24,680
the Hippie is just this,
what's mostly there,

261
00:10:24,681 --> 00:10:26,720
right?
Like people that were working out and

262
00:10:26,721 --> 00:10:27,150
hippie.

263
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:29,430
Yes.
Boulder's a lot of that Boulder's hippie

264
00:10:29,431 --> 00:10:31,410
and boulders.
People that don't really good shape.

265
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,210
Right.
No one wears makeup.

266
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,060
No one looks like a horror.
Yeah.

267
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,440
Shit.
And that's kind of a bummer.

268
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,920
But I have to get the girl pregnant or
something.

269
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,340
Not a lot of girls,
uh,

270
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:44,610
like the ones that you're around all the
time in California,

271
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,650
there's not a lot that's very rare for
the whole

272
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,880
world.
Yeah.

273
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:48,840
Well that's,
you know,

274
00:10:48,841 --> 00:10:50,400
I go ups and downs,
you know,

275
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,020
my dating is not,
it's a,

276
00:10:52,021 --> 00:10:54,090
it's a,
it's like a stock market graph.

277
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:55,741
You know,
it's like,

278
00:10:55,741 --> 00:11:00,630
I don't really look for what you saying,
but what I'm saying is living in Los

279
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,490
Angeles has given you access to these
girls.

280
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,050
Why leave that?
That's worth it.

281
00:11:04,051 --> 00:11:07,550
That's what
they see.

282
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,850
Die With it.
Hard on,

283
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,530
you can find hot chicks and Colorado,
they're just not going to be quite so

284
00:11:13,531 --> 00:11:14,364
needy.
Yeah.

285
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,301
It's fucked up.
You know?

286
00:11:15,301 --> 00:11:18,600
Ever since I got in this relationship,
I already see my standup going away.

287
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:20,310
Just like how it was.
Does,

288
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:21,031
it's like,
Hey,

289
00:11:21,031 --> 00:11:23,550
do you want to have sex and hang out
with this hot girl or do you want it to

290
00:11:23,551 --> 00:11:27,600
stand up and hang out with four guys
that you barely know?

291
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:30,170
You got a tricky situation because if
you really want to do stand up,

292
00:11:30,171 --> 00:11:32,940
you can't just do it fast.
And my shows are half ounce,

293
00:11:32,941 --> 00:11:34,860
right.
So I'm making myself go at night,

294
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:35,870
but um,
you know,

295
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,370
have you been writing because when I'm,
you know,

296
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,750
I'm not writing as much either.

297
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,800
Yeah,
you're weak.

298
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:43,780
Weak.
He just given,

299
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,570
but it's easy to do,
man.

300
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:47,190
I did that when I was in high school.
Yeah.

301
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:50,670
I used to have a whole joke about it.
About how when I was in high school,

302
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,860
I played baseball.
I did all the,

303
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,100
until I started getting

304
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,640
lid and then I was like,
whatever would all that other stuff.

305
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,240
My parents were like,
what about baseball?

306
00:11:59,241 --> 00:12:00,074
I'm like,
yeah,

307
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,100
found this new thing.
I think I like it more right now.

308
00:12:03,101 --> 00:12:04,930
Like once you start having sex,
like,

309
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,450
like why?
Why am I playing baseball?

310
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:09,310
Yeah,
that Shit's boring.

311
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:10,810
Yeah.
I watch,

312
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,520
I watch.
Have you,

313
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,910
do you,
you don't have your first set on tape

314
00:12:12,911 --> 00:12:14,000
too?
No,

315
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,900
no.
Yeah.

316
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:18,200
I'd watch it the other day at the awful.
It's horrible.

317
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,360
It sucks.
It's just,

318
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,700
just everything stuck.
Do you like the new ones though?

319
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,040
I like the new ones,
definitely.

320
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,910
It's definitely like before you could,
you could see the nervousness on stage

321
00:12:26,911 --> 00:12:28,390
and I mean this was 2003

322
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,720
or whatever,
but I,

323
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:33,190
it was gross.
I can't even fucking imagine.

324
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:36,070
It's hard to watch my,
my sets from like last night,

325
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,930
like killed.
It's still weird.

326
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,880
You know,
it's hard even if you're killing,

327
00:12:39,881 --> 00:12:41,170
but man,
if you're not killing,

328
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,210
it's painful.
So painful.

329
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,630
Uh,
stand up.

330
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,210
You got to figure out brown if you
really want to do it because if we

331
00:12:49,211 --> 00:12:50,770
really want to do it,
there's only one way to do it.

332
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:53,410
You've got to go gang busters.
You gotta like put together an act.

333
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:57,070
You've got a rare opportunity man.
You're on the road with me all the time.

334
00:12:57,071 --> 00:12:59,260
So you get to do these sets in front of
these giant crowds.

335
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:02,740
I guess I,
you have how I look at standup is more

336
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:04,330
as I enjoy doing it.
Kind of like,

337
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,710
I like doing it,
playing baseball,

338
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:08,230
you know,
I like bowling but I guess I'm not

339
00:13:08,231 --> 00:13:12,490
looking as it in a career and I don't
think I ever want to do it as a career

340
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:13,241
wise.
I think.

341
00:13:13,241 --> 00:13:15,940
I think if anything,
it's just a workout for this podcast.

342
00:13:15,941 --> 00:13:16,750
Even,
you know,

343
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,400
make you more comfortable and more
comfortable and you know,

344
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:22,630
thinking of funny ideas and you're just
being creative,

345
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,400
you know?
Because if I'm not doing this,

346
00:13:24,401 --> 00:13:27,400
then I'm painting.
If I have to be doing something and now,

347
00:13:27,401 --> 00:13:29,580
right now it's just,
you just have so much in you,

348
00:13:29,581 --> 00:13:31,150
you need to get out.
Yeah.

349
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:35,680
Shrooms.
Really Nice to reset that though.

350
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:37,240
You need to shoot him again soon,
man.

351
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,600
It's,
I certainly like the other day and it's,

352
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:43,090
it wasn't the best one,
but it definitely just opens up how you

353
00:13:43,091 --> 00:13:44,410
look at everything.
So Risa,

354
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,273
yeah,
definitely.

355
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,520
Are we setting,
I do that every time I get in the tank.

356
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:49,230
Yeah.
It takes a big reset.

357
00:13:49,231 --> 00:13:51,570
You need to try that.
But yeah.

358
00:13:51,571 --> 00:13:52,171
Any,
any,

359
00:13:52,171 --> 00:13:56,670
any opportunity that you have to just
fucking to step outside of the whole

360
00:13:56,671 --> 00:13:59,100
thing and just relax and let's take a
look at this.

361
00:13:59,101 --> 00:14:00,360
Let's assess this.
You know,

362
00:14:00,361 --> 00:14:02,820
from an even position so many times in
life,

363
00:14:02,821 --> 00:14:04,350
man,
you're just on momentum,

364
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,233
right.
You know,

365
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:08,640
every one step from the next.
It's like there's something pushing

366
00:14:08,641 --> 00:14:10,290
behind you and you just keep moving.

367
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:15,000
Have you ever forgotten to tena forgot
to put take off a condom after second?

368
00:14:15,001 --> 00:14:16,500
Like not no.
Like,

369
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,060
uh,
like sometimes you know,

370
00:14:18,061 --> 00:14:21,720
like I'll have sex in like then,
you know when I call him and then I'll

371
00:14:21,721 --> 00:14:22,650
take the condom,
throw away,

372
00:14:22,651 --> 00:14:25,440
put a new condom on so I can continue
and did not come again.

373
00:14:25,441 --> 00:14:28,590
But I forget I have that condom on.
You're getting way too personal,

374
00:14:28,591 --> 00:14:29,570
but I know,
I know I'm trying,

375
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:30,740
I was trying to clean it up a little
but,

376
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:33,570
but,
but I was swimming and then I went to go

377
00:14:33,571 --> 00:14:35,610
piss and I'm sitting there going,
ah,

378
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,100
pain into the condom.
Yeah.

379
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,150
I didn't know the condoms or not and I
didn't hear the water.

380
00:14:39,151 --> 00:14:39,850
And I'm like,
what?

381
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:41,750
Well,
I'd be the laziest motherfucker I've

382
00:14:41,751 --> 00:14:44,120
ever met in my life.
But when you're so lazy you can even

383
00:14:44,121 --> 00:14:48,830
take your condom off to be,
it's be bothered.

384
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:51,770
You never know the way down there.
Didn't know it was on there,

385
00:14:51,771 --> 00:14:51,980
but

386
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:56,180
it's crazy how much pee comes out so
fast because it was like a full balloon

387
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:58,420
when I looked down.
And the first thing you do,

388
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,500
fuck does it stay on your desk?
I don't know.

389
00:15:00,501 --> 00:15:02,150
It stayed on pretty,
I guess pushy.

390
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,650
Just dried or something.
I don't know.

391
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:06,590
But it's crazy.
Your first thing to do is like holy

392
00:15:06,591 --> 00:15:08,750
shit.
And so I just like kind of like pulled

393
00:15:08,751 --> 00:15:13,751
it off in the weight of the p dropped
into the toilet and just start spraying

394
00:15:14,181 --> 00:15:17,060
out back out of the toilet and it would
piss everywhere.

395
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:18,200
Oh,
it's fucking,

396
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:21,200
that doesn't even make sense.
How does that condom stay on you while

397
00:15:21,201 --> 00:15:24,590
you're pissing did it?
Didn't it didn't fall on a loop?

398
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:27,080
Did you use,
I didn't know.

399
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,070
I did use it.
I think I might've had some flush loop

400
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,170
around.
No,

401
00:15:30,171 --> 00:15:31,410
I didn't know I was at the,
no I did.

402
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,560
So it's just whatever lube was on the
condom.

403
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:34,640
Yeah.
Yeah.

404
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,260
Wow.
That's fucked.

405
00:15:36,261 --> 00:15:37,540
High Condom.
It was a tight condo.

406
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,413
That's ridiculous.

407
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:39,800
Go over your balls.
Huh?

408
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:42,940
That's uh,
that's an old joke.

409
00:15:42,941 --> 00:15:44,350
A friend of mine,
Amir Golan.

410
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,030
Um,
fuck what?

411
00:15:46,031 --> 00:15:48,610
I forget what his fake name was.
He used to have a fake name that he used

412
00:15:48,611 --> 00:15:49,880
to use on stage,
I should call it.

413
00:15:49,881 --> 00:15:51,640
I forgot what his name was,
but anyway,

414
00:15:51,641 --> 00:15:52,120
he,
uh,

415
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,490
he had this joke about a,
the first,

416
00:15:53,491 --> 00:15:54,880
I remember the first time I put on a
condom,

417
00:15:54,881 --> 00:15:57,640
it was really tight.
I got back from the bathroom and the

418
00:15:57,641 --> 00:15:59,050
girl was laughing at me.
I was like,

419
00:15:59,051 --> 00:16:00,730
this is fucking painful.
Why you laughing?

420
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,860
She goes,
it doesn't have to go over your balls.

421
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:07,030
Fucking idiot.
He had a bunch of great jokes.

422
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:08,620
Here's another one.
Yeah,

423
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:13,450
my friend got his girlfriend pregnant.
They were having anal sex.

424
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,520
You know,
the baby looks like shit.

425
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:21,290
That's so stupid.
But um,

426
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:22,510
fuck.
Anyway,

427
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,120
you're so lazy.
You don't take off your coat.

428
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,370
God,
I wish rooming having sex and I feel

429
00:16:27,371 --> 00:16:30,190
like incredibly lazy personnel.
Do you ever like look at some of the

430
00:16:30,191 --> 00:16:32,090
shit that you say?
Um,

431
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,000
like lazy in general?
In Life?

432
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:34,730
Well,
yeah.

433
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:37,690
It was just like,
I always think I have some kind of like

434
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,690
if I ain't got my thyroid check but,
and it was fine,

435
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,570
but I always think that I always have
had some kind of like,

436
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,730
you know,
I'm always feel like I need speed.

437
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,950
Like I need something.
Like when I drink so much coffee,

438
00:16:47,951 --> 00:16:49,510
it doesn't feel like it does.
It does anything.

439
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,240
Are you,
uh,

440
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,290
do you think you have add or something
like that?

441
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,180
No,
I wouldn't say do one of those fucking

442
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:56,340
buckle up Republican guy.
There is no way,

443
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,460
dude.
I would cry.

444
00:16:57,461 --> 00:16:59,100
I was a kid.
They were just nutty,

445
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:03,480
nutty kids so that diseased now stop
coddling them now.

446
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,610
I probably think it's cause I just don't
work out.

447
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:09,480
I don't do shit like that.
That my body's just in fifth grader.

448
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:11,760
You need to slow the body.
Yeah.

449
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:14,490
You need to kick your body and the get
all this hump and should be doing

450
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:15,540
something for him.
Yeah,

451
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:17,130
absolutely.
That'd be firing up your fucking

452
00:17:17,131 --> 00:17:18,180
testosterone bags.

453
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:18,991
Bang,
Bang,

454
00:17:18,991 --> 00:17:19,920
Bang.
Yeah,

455
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:21,000
no.
Yeah,

456
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,080
sure.
I don't know.

457
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,890
What were we talking about?
We're talking about you being lazy as

458
00:17:25,891 --> 00:17:26,640
fuck.
Yeah.

459
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:31,640
I think it's either exercise or it's
probably some kind of deficiency of some

460
00:17:32,311 --> 00:17:33,300
kind.
Probably that I,

461
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,410
I need like,

462
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:35,270
well,
I see,

463
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,103
I know that,
uh,

464
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,210
I know friends that are on that Adderall
shit.

465
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,940
Oh,
I needed it to concentrate and,

466
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:42,423
yeah.
Okay.

467
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,870
I guess,
but it's speed,

468
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,630
you know,
I can't think you're going to last very

469
00:17:47,631 --> 00:17:50,220
long on speed.
I don't like what it feels

470
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,440
like.
I'll have a cup of coffee during the

471
00:17:52,441 --> 00:17:55,200
podcast and a cup.
One Cup of coffee is fine,

472
00:17:55,201 --> 00:17:57,120
but if I have two cups of coffee during
the podcast,

473
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,150
after the podcast is over,
I feel all amped up.

474
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:03,750
I feel like I don't feel shitty.
I don't feel that at all.

475
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,420
The only get like there's a lot of
energy in your system.

476
00:18:06,421 --> 00:18:07,470
No,
it doesn't work.

477
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,990
But what I do notice is that I clinch
when I,

478
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,910
when,
when instead of feeling that energy,

479
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,910
I'll find myself like reading,
clenching my teeth really hard.

480
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,440
I don't know.
Out of nowhere,

481
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,810
I do it all the time.
I noticed on the way home yesterday

482
00:18:18,811 --> 00:18:21,320
because I had two cups of coffee here
yesterday and it was,

483
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:23,580
I was driving and I'm like,
why am I clenching my teeth?

484
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,320
Like I don't know what it is.
Like it's like it's all going to my,

485
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,940
my jaw dude.

486
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,430
You've got to be one of the weirdest
motherfuckers have ever met.

487
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,811
I do it all the time.
If you,

488
00:18:33,811 --> 00:18:36,780
if you look back at old use dreams,
you'll see like this line on my,

489
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:39,960
I do this and I bite my cheek.
And are you thinking about anything

490
00:18:39,961 --> 00:18:41,220
where you're doing it?
Doing it?

491
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,890
I'm just like clenching.
You have this energy that you got to get

492
00:18:43,891 --> 00:18:45,840
out.
Yeah and my mouth squeeze off around.

493
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:50,790
Wow.
Maybe you have some like unaddressed

494
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:52,780
energy issues.
You know,

495
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,460
maybe if you like started doing
something like like throwing the discus

496
00:18:56,550 --> 00:19:00,540
or something like really physical you
maybe you would like feel much better.

497
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:03,120
I've been trying to Xbox at dance game
on connected.

498
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:06,630
It works pretty good
shit.

499
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:10,440
What are they going to have?
Some sort of a martial arts game where

500
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:13,200
like a robot does certain moves and you
can kick it,

501
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:15,630
you know,
get like moves forward and you can leg

502
00:19:15,631 --> 00:19:16,560
kick and it moves forward.

503
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:19,060
Your Punch.
It doesn't have to do much this to be a

504
00:19:19,061 --> 00:19:20,530
target.
I think this connect thing,

505
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:21,660
I don't know if you know what connect
is,

506
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:23,430
it's like that,
that Webcam thing that they put,

507
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,740
you put it on top of your TV and it
detects your body.

508
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,570
It works.
I don't know,

509
00:19:27,571 --> 00:19:28,860
like I'm not,
I haven't played that much,

510
00:19:28,861 --> 00:19:30,750
but the games I've played fucking bad
ass.

511
00:19:30,751 --> 00:19:33,270
It's like a where you just hold up your
hand.

512
00:19:33,271 --> 00:19:35,580
Like you can even do Netflix.
We're streaming through movies going

513
00:19:35,581 --> 00:19:38,460
like this with your hand moving it left
or right your string through movies and

514
00:19:38,461 --> 00:19:40,410
if you want to pick one you pull,
push your,

515
00:19:40,411 --> 00:19:43,590
pull your hand out and grab it.
And it's kind of like a whatever

516
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,740
minority report or whatever.
But,

517
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,690
but they have games to where you don't
have any controllers anymore.

518
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,640
So how of,
how accurate is it?

519
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:51,820
How effective is it?
You know,

520
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,180
from what I understand,
it's not the best,

521
00:19:54,181 --> 00:19:56,460
but I have never noticed it not being
accurate.

522
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:58,140
I think it's pretty accurate.
So I,

523
00:19:58,141 --> 00:20:01,470
I've heard the long as you're not
playing like a first person shooter or

524
00:20:01,471 --> 00:20:03,300
something where you'd have,
I think it's good enough for that.

525
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,660
I think it's really up for that.
I think it's really based on lighting

526
00:20:06,661 --> 00:20:08,980
and clothing and w because like,
uh,

527
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:12,660
the girl I was with was wearing a dress
and it couldn't detect separate legs.

528
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:15,960
So it was kind of fucking up.
So she took off her dress and then it

529
00:20:15,961 --> 00:20:17,140
worked perfect.
The,

530
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,140
it's a trick and wanted you to be a
whore.

531
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,300
That's right.
Well that's what I told her.

532
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,190
Cause you have a dress on it.
Too much clothes on.

533
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,390
God,
what are you doing over there?

534
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,200
That's crazy.
So now if you're using it as a first

535
00:20:28,201 --> 00:20:29,790
person shooter,
how do you pull triggers?

536
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:30,390
Um,
see,

537
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:32,130
I don't know.
I haven't played a first person shooter,

538
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:34,920
but what I would imagine,
I don't know.

539
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:37,470
That'd be weird.
I don't know how they're going to do it.

540
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,780
We can't talk.
We can't talk about that one thing,

541
00:20:39,781 --> 00:20:42,300
but uh,
there is a crazy first person shooter

542
00:20:42,301 --> 00:20:44,520
that we can't talk about something now.
No one.

543
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:48,190
Not because I don't think it's known.
Somebody tell us this.

544
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,350
No,
that the,

545
00:20:49,351 --> 00:20:51,530
the,
the video that I showed you that Kevin

546
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:53,230
Prayer it might've showed us.
Oh,

547
00:20:53,231 --> 00:20:53,711
right,
right,

548
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:54,161
right,
right,

549
00:20:54,161 --> 00:20:54,850
right.
Yeah.

550
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:56,230
That's all.
Think Cognito,

551
00:20:56,231 --> 00:20:57,490
I didn't know what the fuck you're
talking about.

552
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,250
Yeah,
because he got to think of a guy.

553
00:21:00,251 --> 00:21:01,780
If you're doing a first person shooter,
you got,

554
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:03,190
you got to deal with two things.
One,

555
00:21:03,191 --> 00:21:06,430
how do you simulate movement?
Like how do you go forward,

556
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,511
you know,
you're running,

557
00:21:07,511 --> 00:21:09,730
how do you go on forward and how does
the machine know you're running back?

558
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:11,610
But because you're not moving forward
though,

559
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,620
I think it's good with your hands.
Like because with the dance game,

560
00:21:14,621 --> 00:21:16,390
it was like you did like something like
that.

561
00:21:16,391 --> 00:21:18,520
That means forward.
You go like this and you shake your hand

562
00:21:18,521 --> 00:21:19,780
to the right.
That means you're shooting.

563
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,480
Well,
ideally what you want is like a giant

564
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,960
dome or a ball rather,
and you be inside that ball like a

565
00:21:25,961 --> 00:21:30,730
hamster ball and that ball you have like
some sort of a three d helmet on like a

566
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,560
complete,
you know,

567
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,550
what is it?

568
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:36,070
Virtual reality,
complete virtual reality helmet on.

569
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,740
And then you would be walking around
with this ball.

570
00:21:38,741 --> 00:21:40,870
You could walk in any direction,
you know,

571
00:21:40,871 --> 00:21:43,660
it wouldn't feel totally real.
Like you would kind of be realizing that

572
00:21:43,661 --> 00:21:45,880
you're on a ball and then you're stuck
in this,

573
00:21:45,881 --> 00:21:47,020
you know,
in this thing.

574
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:49,150
But that would be,
I mean,

575
00:21:49,151 --> 00:21:51,400
other than that,
how the fuck else could you simulate

576
00:21:51,401 --> 00:21:54,640
movement unless you just did it inside,
like the virtual reality,

577
00:21:54,641 --> 00:21:57,610
then I wouldn't even be virtual anymore.
You'd have to do it inside,

578
00:21:57,611 --> 00:21:58,150
like,
uh,

579
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,660
put a program and then make,
make a program the exact parameters of

580
00:22:01,661 --> 00:22:05,350
say an airplane hangar and then you have
an empty airplane hangar and they walk

581
00:22:05,351 --> 00:22:06,790
around inside that hanger.
Yeah,

582
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:09,760
look,
it's all wired and you could do it that

583
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:11,170
way.
But then that kind of defeats the whole

584
00:22:11,171 --> 00:22:12,550
purpose of virtual reality,
right?

585
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:15,220
The idea is that you're supposed to be
able to do it wherever you are.

586
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:17,410
Yeah.
Would you ever go to burning man?

587
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,513
No.
Why not?

588
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:22,030
Too many hippies.
I learned about hippies when I moved to

589
00:22:22,031 --> 00:22:24,070
boulder.
I liked him in theory.

590
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,230
Yeah,
I liked him in theory,

591
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,240
I don't,
I don't like a lot of people that are

592
00:22:28,241 --> 00:22:31,090
asking for money all the time.
I find that shouldn't be very annoying.

593
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:35,200
I don't like people playing shitty songs
and wanting a dollar.

594
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,430
Right.
You know,

595
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,980
for the most part that cool.
But you know,

596
00:22:38,981 --> 00:22:42,520
there's just,
there's too much of that hippie movement

597
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:45,310
that wants people to help them.
You know?

598
00:22:45,311 --> 00:22:50,260
And this is how I feel about that.
If I felt like everybody was on the ball

599
00:22:50,261 --> 00:22:53,380
and everybody was doing their best,
and you know,

600
00:22:53,381 --> 00:22:57,670
I'm a generous person and I think one of
the things about being generous is if

601
00:22:57,671 --> 00:23:01,450
you have the opportunity to do so,
it feels really good to be generous,

602
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:03,880
especially if it doesn't affect you.

603
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,070
It's not like you're being generous in,
it's hurting you.

604
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,250
You know?
So I think it's,

605
00:23:07,251 --> 00:23:09,370
it's important,
but in passing,

606
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:13,330
like say you're passing love to the left
and there's a big circle of people,

607
00:23:13,331 --> 00:23:16,120
man,
the real promise was a lot of fucking

608
00:23:16,121 --> 00:23:20,650
people that never keep passing the love.
They take it and then they walk away.

609
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,621
You know,
there's,

610
00:23:21,621 --> 00:23:24,430
there's some people that are always
there for you.

611
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:28,150
There's some people and they're doing
their best and they're there.

612
00:23:28,151 --> 00:23:31,110
They're living their life and you're
doing your best and you're living your

613
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,620
life and you're helping each other and
you,

614
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:33,880
hey man,
can I borrow your truck?

615
00:23:33,881 --> 00:23:34,870
I've got to move.
Fuck yeah man.

616
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:36,460
Come on over it dude.
Anytime you got my shit,

617
00:23:36,461 --> 00:23:37,300
you know,
you know,

618
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:38,920
we're friends.
You help me,

619
00:23:38,921 --> 00:23:40,240
I help you.
We're all together.

620
00:23:40,241 --> 00:23:44,860
But we all know those the few people
that don't contribute,

621
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:47,240
they always need something and they
don't contribute.

622
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:50,150
And my experience,
that's my experience with hippies.

623
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:54,200
That's my experience with,
of people that you know,

624
00:23:54,201 --> 00:23:57,620
are like really into like socialist
ideals.

625
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:01,310
A lot of it is because they're fucking
lazy man.

626
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:05,180
They're fucking lazy and they don't work
that hard and they don't do their part

627
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:08,720
and they somehow or another field,
like the whole system's unfair man.

628
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,190
Which fuck yeah,
of course it is.

629
00:24:10,191 --> 00:24:11,940
Of course it's unfair.
Of course it's corrupt.

630
00:24:11,941 --> 00:24:14,240
Of course it's fucked up,
but that's not why you're a loser.

631
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,070
There's a lot of people that aren't
losers.

632
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:20,420
Most people are losers because they're
lazy as shit and they want to blame

633
00:24:20,421 --> 00:24:23,180
other people for that and they want to
blame society and they want to blame.

634
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:25,280
Look,
society is completely fucked.

635
00:24:25,281 --> 00:24:27,560
But guess what?
It's not like there's one person that

636
00:24:27,561 --> 00:24:30,110
makes it.
Fuck the whole thing is it's fuck cause

637
00:24:30,111 --> 00:24:32,180
it's on a foundation of bullshit.

638
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:36,920
It doesn't make any sense.
But knowing that you see what it is,

639
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:39,260
make your path,
make your path.

640
00:24:39,261 --> 00:24:41,810
Figure out something that you can do to
feed yourself.

641
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:43,880
Okay?
Figuring out something you can do to put

642
00:24:43,881 --> 00:24:45,890
a roof over your head.
If you just figure it out,

643
00:24:45,891 --> 00:24:47,480
man,
fucking figure it out.

644
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:49,280
It doesn't mean you have to be a fucking
asshole.

645
00:24:49,281 --> 00:24:51,860
To be successful doesn't mean you have
to be a part of the system,

646
00:24:51,861 --> 00:24:53,960
man.
Now just dot.

647
00:24:53,961 --> 00:24:56,720
Stop asking people for money.
Stop being a fucking Mooch.

648
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:58,250
Get your shit together.
Okay?

649
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:01,820
That's my problem with hippies.
My plan with hippies is part of the

650
00:25:01,821 --> 00:25:05,240
whole idea of being a hippie as being
like really nice and being really

651
00:25:05,241 --> 00:25:07,850
relaxed and sometimes life does not call
for that.

652
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:11,300
Sometimes life calls for you gotta get
off your fucking ass and make something

653
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:12,134
happen,
man.

654
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,040
Yeah.

655
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,300
You know,
there's a lot.

656
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:15,660
I had a friend who was his,
what?

657
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,240
His girlfriend was having a baby.
This was many,

658
00:25:17,241 --> 00:25:21,110
many years ago and I had a fucking
scream at this guy.

659
00:25:21,111 --> 00:25:23,960
This guy was unemployed and he,
he was like,

660
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:27,170
he couldn't get his shit together.
He couldn't make something happen.

661
00:25:27,171 --> 00:25:29,660
He was trying to be a comedian for a
while that didn't work out,

662
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,190
and then he was trying to do some other
stuff.

663
00:25:31,191 --> 00:25:34,190
You're trying to do some radio and a
budget and we have this conversation and

664
00:25:34,191 --> 00:25:34,970
I'm like,
man,

665
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:37,580
you got to realize you're going to
become that fucking guy.

666
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:42,260
You're going to become that unbelievably
pathetic guy who can't feed his kids.

667
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,060
Right?
You got to fucking do something,

668
00:25:44,061 --> 00:25:45,590
man.
You've got to make something happen.

669
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:46,940
And you know,
it's not,

670
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:47,900
hey,
you know,

671
00:25:47,901 --> 00:25:50,540
we really need some food.
Do you think you could help us?

672
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,960
That's the hippie approach to go to
people and you've got to make your own

673
00:25:53,961 --> 00:25:55,730
fucking way.
You've gotta make your own way.

674
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:59,270
And that was my problem with boulder.
And that would ultimately,

675
00:25:59,271 --> 00:26:00,920
I'm sure it'd be my problem with
Portland,

676
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,740
and it's a bit of my problem with San
Francisco and it's not that I'm not a

677
00:26:03,741 --> 00:26:05,480
kind person,
I'm a very kind person,

678
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,350
but I recognize the difference between
someone who's in need and someone who's

679
00:26:09,351 --> 00:26:11,930
fucking lazy.
And there's a lot of people that just

680
00:26:11,931 --> 00:26:14,060
weak.
They're weak is shit man.

681
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:16,670
And they have no philosophy to live
their life by,

682
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:20,030
they have no discipline that they've
developed over years of trying to

683
00:26:20,031 --> 00:26:22,460
accomplish things to the point where
they have this sense of,

684
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,890
of personal sovereignty.
They can take care of themselves.

685
00:26:24,891 --> 00:26:26,660
And I like occasionally everybody needs
help.

686
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,630
But if somebody will help you,
if they know that you're the type of

687
00:26:29,631 --> 00:26:32,200
person that will help them and if you
know that you're the type of person that

688
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:35,660
does their best.
The what drives me nuts is when someone

689
00:26:35,661 --> 00:26:37,340
wants help.
Like motherfucker,

690
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:39,290
you're not even helping yourself.
Like,

691
00:26:39,291 --> 00:26:42,170
look what you're doing for yourself and
you want someone else to step in and

692
00:26:42,171 --> 00:26:44,190
manage your fucking,
that's

693
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:45,780
ridiculous man.
That's,

694
00:26:45,781 --> 00:26:48,810
that's,
that is the number one problem with the

695
00:26:48,811 --> 00:26:51,450
whole idea of everyone together,
man.

696
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:54,540
The real problem is that everyone
doesn't do their fucking part.

697
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:56,400
Man.
That's the real problem.

698
00:26:56,401 --> 00:26:58,830
There's a lot of lazy pitches in this
world.

699
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,110
The reason why I was asking about
burning man,

700
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:03,110
I,
I've often thought the same thing like

701
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,730
fuck hippies and you know,
cause I,

702
00:27:04,731 --> 00:27:05,940
I been there,
done that.

703
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,190
I hate it.
I hated the people too.

704
00:27:08,191 --> 00:27:10,320
That the lazy hip,
there's good heaviness.

705
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,420
There's legit hippies.
Right?

706
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,490
But I hung out with bad hippies.
They got bad,

707
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,660
you know,
so like everything else,

708
00:27:15,661 --> 00:27:17,090
it's like MMA fans.
Well,

709
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,870
I have a lot of friends that are MMA
fans.

710
00:27:18,871 --> 00:27:20,670
I have friends have graduated from
Harvard,

711
00:27:20,671 --> 00:27:23,060
friends that are fucking,
I knows guys who were scientists.

712
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:25,680
I the guy who created a,
um,

713
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,600
a Beavis and butthead,
Mike Judge,

714
00:27:27,601 --> 00:27:28,500
huge MMA fan.

715
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,420
I mean there's a lot of intelligent MMA
fans.

716
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:32,010
Yeah.
But then there's a lot of idiots.

717
00:27:32,011 --> 00:27:34,560
Yeah.
But I was looking at these videos lately

718
00:27:34,561 --> 00:27:36,270
cause the girl goes every year or
whatever.

719
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:40,140
And so there is some fucking cool shit
going on at burning man.

720
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:43,170
I'm sure.
And I guess you can rent these big Rvs,

721
00:27:43,171 --> 00:27:43,691
you know,
and,

722
00:27:43,691 --> 00:27:45,440
and that's the way to do.
It's the happier RV.

723
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:48,210
You don't live in a tent or whatever.
They have showers and stuff.

724
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:49,080
But,
uh,

725
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,940
there's this thing called,
I don't know if you ever heard of it.

726
00:27:50,941 --> 00:27:52,320
It's uh,
they're called,

727
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:53,220
uh,
let's see,

728
00:27:53,221 --> 00:27:54,970
where did they called?
Um,

729
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,780
her most shit.
It's at Zio tropes.

730
00:27:57,781 --> 00:28:00,550
Have you heard of a zero trope?
Xeo trope is d.

731
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:04,980
I'm sorry.
Zoetrope Zooey Trope C.

732
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:04,980
O.
E.

733
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:04,980
T.
R.

734
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:04,980
O.
P.

735
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:05,810
E.
What it is,

736
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:10,260
is it's like a carousel type thing,
like America round and each kind of,

737
00:28:10,261 --> 00:28:10,841
you know,
a cup,

738
00:28:10,841 --> 00:28:13,200
a couple of feet,
there's an like a drawn or there's some

739
00:28:13,201 --> 00:28:16,610
kind of sculpture,
like it's like a monkey hanging from a a

740
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:17,310
vine.

741
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:18,510
And then the next one,
like,

742
00:28:18,511 --> 00:28:20,850
you know,
three feet over isn't the same monkey,

743
00:28:20,851 --> 00:28:22,920
but it's kinda changing a little,
you know,

744
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:27,930
so when it turns and you have a flashing
light that just flashes at a certain

745
00:28:27,931 --> 00:28:31,530
rate,
it's like the monkeys are moving.

746
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:33,450
So it's in the middle of this desert and
there's like,

747
00:28:33,451 --> 00:28:37,290
they have these statues of like people
diving down into the ground that just

748
00:28:37,291 --> 00:28:40,050
melt into the ground.
They have like these monkey,

749
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,240
uh,
that are spinning a check this out right

750
00:28:42,241 --> 00:28:42,661
here.
Here's,

751
00:28:42,661 --> 00:28:44,280
here's the,
here's a monkey one.

752
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,040
I don't know if you can see this.
Uh,

753
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:46,921
here's a monkey.
Wow.

754
00:28:46,921 --> 00:28:50,280
That is bad.
And it's fucking trippy.

755
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:52,920
So anyway,
so basically they've done is animation.

756
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:54,060
Animation.
Yeah.

757
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:57,960
And just like the old claymation models
they used to use for like King Kong and

758
00:28:57,961 --> 00:28:58,530
Shit.
Yeah.

759
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:01,170
Or like a old flip book where you draw
on a flip book and he flipped it.

760
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:02,070
That's bad ass,
man.

761
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:04,050
I'm down with the artistic end of it,
you know,

762
00:29:04,051 --> 00:29:05,840
I'm down with the,
the whole idea of a,

763
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:08,010
all these artists getting together and
doing cool shit.

764
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:09,900
I just think there'd be a lot of stinky
people.

765
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:12,300
I just wonder why I don't,
or maybe they have.

766
00:29:12,301 --> 00:29:15,660
Why doesn't a collection of people like
yourself,

767
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:16,920
uh,
do a comedy show?

768
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:19,080
Why they're there?
Because that is huge,

769
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,970
you know,
I'd rather know perform there.

770
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:22,440
If I was going to go there,
I'd want to,

771
00:29:22,441 --> 00:29:23,910
I just want to hang out,
have fun.

772
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:28,920
I got a foreign name magic performing
once the Woodstock of comedy,

773
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:32,730
psychedelic comedy,
there would be so much mushrooms and so

774
00:29:32,731 --> 00:29:34,410
much everything else,
so much fun.

775
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,850
I would be too fucked up.
I would,

776
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,670
I wouldn't want to be talking on stage
through a microphone.

777
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:40,620
That's the last thing you want to do
when you're on shrooms.

778
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:41,080
Oh,
I mean,

779
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,030
yeah.
You just don't do shrooms that hour and

780
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:43,864
a half,
two hours.

781
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:45,440
Yeah.
I think if you're there,

782
00:29:45,441 --> 00:29:47,940
you just want to experience it.
That's what I would want to do.

783
00:29:47,941 --> 00:29:49,470
Yeah,
I'd perform enough,

784
00:29:49,471 --> 00:29:50,640
man.
I performed plenty.

785
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,010
You know,
I think I,

786
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:54,870
Freddy Soto used to say this back in the
day,

787
00:29:54,871 --> 00:29:57,120
you know,
people used to offer Freddy gigs at like

788
00:29:57,450 --> 00:29:58,910
bars and stuff like that.
It's in,

789
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,120
it's like,
no thank you,

790
00:30:00,121 --> 00:30:01,980
I appreciate it,
but I don't only do comedy clubs,

791
00:30:01,981 --> 00:30:02,700
man,
that's it.

792
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,200
And that was his,
he just is like,

793
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,310
it's not worth it,
man.

794
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:08,850
You go to these bars and everyone's
talking and you can't do your act right.

795
00:30:08,851 --> 00:30:11,010
Your rush it because you're trying to
get their attention.

796
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:12,870
And he was totally right.
You know,

797
00:30:12,871 --> 00:30:15,840
he's totally right.
And that's Kinda how I am right now.

798
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,680
I only do shows I'll do,
here's my show I'm doing,

799
00:30:19,681 --> 00:30:20,670
it's,
I'm at this theater,

800
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,260
come see me,
I'm at this comedy club.

801
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:22,960
Come in,
that's,

802
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,230
and then there's no problems.
There's no hassles.

803
00:30:25,231 --> 00:30:28,020
It is what it is.
But if you're just doing a fucking look,

804
00:30:28,021 --> 00:30:31,740
you're in a tent with some speakers and
you're on this stage and all these

805
00:30:31,741 --> 00:30:34,110
people are all,
they're all fucked out of their minds

806
00:30:34,111 --> 00:30:36,030
when you know,
why should they pay attention to you?

807
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:38,430
They shouldn't.
You would feel illegitimate standing

808
00:30:38,431 --> 00:30:40,440
there asking them to,
if you knew that everyone in the crowd

809
00:30:40,441 --> 00:30:42,180
was on mushrooms,
you would have nothing to say.

810
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:43,920
They look it.
Unless I'm on mushrooms to,

811
00:30:43,921 --> 00:30:46,230
what am I going to tell you guys?
I'm not going to tell you shit,

812
00:30:46,231 --> 00:30:47,860
man.
You're communicating with the ear,

813
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,360
the alien overlords right now.
You know these beings that have come on

814
00:30:51,361 --> 00:30:54,240
asteroids,
their spores of infested this earth.

815
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,220
You're communicating with them through
eating them.

816
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,680
What?
I'm going to tell you some stupid Dick

817
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:58,770
Jokes.

818
00:30:58,770 --> 00:30:59,201
Yeah,
but you're,

819
00:30:59,201 --> 00:31:02,130
you're pretty pretty known for being a
psychic psychedelic speaker.

820
00:31:02,131 --> 00:31:03,660
I mean,
you always do the marijuana shows here

821
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:06,390
in town and stuff like that for the same
reason to the same kind of people.

822
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,750
Yeah.
But the thing part of being into

823
00:31:08,751 --> 00:31:11,840
psychedelics and understanding
psychedelics and I've had psychedelic

824
00:31:11,841 --> 00:31:15,710
experiences,
it sort of negates any idea of you

825
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,830
wanting that sort of attention.
Right?

826
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,270
Like doing a show,
like when you're doing a show,

827
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:21,830
the,
the beautiful thing about a show is that

828
00:31:21,831 --> 00:31:24,380
people enjoy and they have a good
fucking time that comes to your comedy

829
00:31:24,381 --> 00:31:26,120
show,
but that's not what you want to do when

830
00:31:26,121 --> 00:31:28,950
you're jazzed out of your head.
You know,

831
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,120
if you're on psychedelics,
you don't want to go see a comedy show,

832
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:34,130
you know,
I don't want to see anything structured

833
00:31:34,131 --> 00:31:37,070
and I certainly don't want someone on
stage like forcing there.

834
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:41,300
Like there's a lot of things you say on
stage in a comedy show that's just to

835
00:31:41,301 --> 00:31:42,530
get a laugh,
you know?

836
00:31:42,531 --> 00:31:45,410
That's what it's there for.
It's there to spice up the show to have

837
00:31:45,411 --> 00:31:48,020
more fun and those things will stand
out.

838
00:31:48,021 --> 00:31:50,480
Like,
like fucking wet shits in your

839
00:31:50,481 --> 00:31:51,314
underwear.
They just like,

840
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:53,030
oh,
what's this?

841
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:56,480
If you're on mushrooms,
every like jokey joke that you have,

842
00:31:56,481 --> 00:31:57,314
which is below,

843
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:00,210
bring Doug Benson and some black lights
and somebody body.

844
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:04,350
It might be a good time.
Doug Benson would just be hugging girls'

845
00:32:04,351 --> 00:32:06,920
high.
You can have a hug to come.

846
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:08,970
A hug.
Never been anybody who's hired more

847
00:32:08,971 --> 00:32:11,010
consistently that Doug Benson.
Yeah.

848
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:13,140
Every now and then he'll send me a
tweet.

849
00:32:13,141 --> 00:32:15,360
You're high right now or a text message
or high right now.

850
00:32:15,361 --> 00:32:16,194
All right.
Yeah,

851
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:19,710
I know you are a motherfucker.
It's so funny because I never knew that

852
00:32:19,711 --> 00:32:21,210
was real.
Like when I first,

853
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:24,180
when I first met Doug,
I thought the whole marijuana thing,

854
00:32:24,181 --> 00:32:26,610
what's kind of like an act?
Kind of like an Andrew dice clay kind of

855
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:26,930
like,
yeah.

856
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:28,050
You know,
like he was doing it.

857
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,920
I mean he might smoke weed,
but I didn't think he was the the crazy

858
00:32:31,921 --> 00:32:34,860
stoner in just after hanging out with
them that first night.

859
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:35,650
Oh fuck.
Yeah.

860
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:36,750
Immediately.
He's like,

861
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:37,950
every five minutes,
hey,

862
00:32:37,951 --> 00:32:39,860
let's go back to your hotel room and
about someone in their joint.

863
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,470
Those guys like to go deep,
man,

864
00:32:42,471 --> 00:32:44,150
this is there.
Some dudes who go real deep.

865
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:47,090
Those guys in involved in the medical
marijuana,

866
00:32:47,091 --> 00:32:50,120
like those,
those look like normal and the toss guys

867
00:32:50,121 --> 00:32:52,670
goes so deep.
We were not normal,

868
00:32:52,671 --> 00:32:54,110
but um,
the cannabis cup,

869
00:32:54,111 --> 00:32:58,220
that was the deepest that I've ever been
and there was an inn on Melrose in

870
00:32:58,221 --> 00:33:01,120
Hollywood.
I was one of the judges and it was at a

871
00:33:01,121 --> 00:33:03,440
a head shop and they'd close the head
shop down.

872
00:33:03,441 --> 00:33:05,720
They papered up the window so no one
could see inside.

873
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,820
They put a doorman in the back,
lock the front,

874
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,280
and then they turned the whole thing
into this Cannabis Cup party.

875
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:13,790
Really fucking bold movement because
they did this shit in the middle of

876
00:33:13,791 --> 00:33:18,080
Hollywood and the place was just filled
with weed.

877
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:21,200
I mean it was unbelievable and no one
stopped.

878
00:33:21,201 --> 00:33:24,710
They just kept going deeper and deeper
and deeper until I left there and went

879
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:25,270
to get something to eat.

880
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:26,120
I'm was like,
I just,

881
00:33:26,121 --> 00:33:29,360
no way I can drive home right now.
I just got to hang out for a few hours.

882
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:30,740
I had to hang out.
I mean,

883
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:34,100
most of the time when you're high
driving is not an issue because driving

884
00:33:34,101 --> 00:33:35,960
is not any more complicated than
walking.

885
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:36,950
You know?
I mean you're,

886
00:33:36,951 --> 00:33:37,460
you're,
you're,

887
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:40,010
as long as you're not smoking Endeca,
as long as you're not smoking some

888
00:33:40,011 --> 00:33:40,844
dopey,
we'd,

889
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:41,630
you know,
you're,

890
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:43,040
if you're driving and you're high,
you know,

891
00:33:43,041 --> 00:33:44,930
just be extra careful.
Watch what you're doing.

892
00:33:44,931 --> 00:33:46,520
It doesn't affect your hand eye
coordination.

893
00:33:46,521 --> 00:33:49,970
I mean I do Jujitsu on weed.
I kickbox and waiting is not a problem

894
00:33:49,971 --> 00:33:52,220
but,
but I was so high that I was like,

895
00:33:52,221 --> 00:33:55,430
no fucking way man.
I was just no way I'm going to drive

896
00:33:55,431 --> 00:33:58,400
this thing and risk not being in control
of my senses.

897
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:02,720
I'm going to have a cup of coffee and
have some food and just fucking sit back

898
00:34:02,721 --> 00:34:06,680
and read myself over a little bit,
go over my notes,

899
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,440
you know,
sit down for a bit before I drove home.

900
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,590
It was too,
it was too stupid cause like you get to

901
00:34:12,591 --> 00:34:14,720
a certain point when when people were
like,

902
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:17,780
everybody's handing you cookies.
Here's a vaporizer bag.

903
00:34:17,781 --> 00:34:18,640
Hit this,
Eh,

904
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:20,720
this is a new blank paper that are
developed,

905
00:34:20,721 --> 00:34:23,420
hit that,
and everyone's passing joints left to

906
00:34:23,421 --> 00:34:26,360
right.
It's like a never ending like a cyclone

907
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,600
of joints getting passed around.
It was fucking ridiculous.

908
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:33,080
But you get to this point where you're
not even high anymore.

909
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:35,510
It's not like you're high anymore.
It's like you're not there.

910
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:39,270
It's like you're,
you were in a room and you know the,

911
00:34:39,271 --> 00:34:42,920
the room has one window and it's a
circular window and the room is like

912
00:34:42,921 --> 00:34:44,560
four by four wide.
You can't even move.

913
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:45,830
I even toilet in it.
It's just you,

914
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:47,270
you,
and that room and that circular window

915
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:50,000
and that circular window is now how you
view the rest of the world.

916
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,930
You're looking out that window.
Go,

917
00:34:51,931 --> 00:34:55,250
what the fuck is going on out there?
Because this is crazy.

918
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,440
I don't even know what's happening out
there.

919
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,870
That's what it's like.
It's like you're,

920
00:34:58,871 --> 00:35:01,550
you're detached from the world.
You're so high,

921
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,560
you're detached,
you know?

922
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:08,000
But those things,
if anybody ever wanted like some sort of

923
00:35:08,001 --> 00:35:10,110
argument against the cause,
right?

924
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,620
Because I don't go to one of those
cannabis cups bad.

925
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:15,740
The good thing is man,
everybody is friendly as fuck.

926
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:20,510
I've been to shit,
a hundred medical marijuana shows or,

927
00:35:20,511 --> 00:35:23,360
or you know,
parties or parties at the playboy

928
00:35:23,361 --> 00:35:25,520
mansion.
I've never seen so much as an argument.

929
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:28,820
Never seen a raised voice,
never seen a a push,

930
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,340
never seen anybody get crazy.
Not even girls,

931
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,350
you know.
I mean every time you go out some girl

932
00:35:33,351 --> 00:35:36,710
would be saying talking shit to some
other girl everywhere in Vegas and La

933
00:35:36,711 --> 00:35:38,100
Anyway.
So if you stay

934
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,220
around the night long enough and pay
attention,

935
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:41,580
you're gonna hear some girl yell at some
girl.

936
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:42,870
Right?
Yeah,

937
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:43,740
totally.
Definitely.

938
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,040
But not in,
in,

939
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:46,950
in this we chose,
we chose,

940
00:35:46,951 --> 00:35:49,440
everybody's is so nice.
This is people.

941
00:35:49,441 --> 00:35:52,140
If people really realize what it could
do for you,

942
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:53,490
you know,
so many people,

943
00:35:53,491 --> 00:35:57,690
like I have a friend who's like super
organized and like he's like really

944
00:35:57,691 --> 00:36:01,020
ambitious and he's,
he produced his television shows like a

945
00:36:01,021 --> 00:36:02,910
real go getter.
Very nice guy.

946
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:05,910
And,
but he's so anal and it just fucking

947
00:36:05,911 --> 00:36:08,190
wound up about shit.
He only wears black.

948
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:12,690
He won't wear anything other than black.
His whole like you open up as wardrobe,

949
00:36:12,691 --> 00:36:13,910
it's black shirts.
And Blair,

950
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:17,000
when somebody does that or would they
only wear the white tee shirt like John

951
00:36:17,001 --> 00:36:17,730
kept,
uh,

952
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:19,220
Cap Barela is that his name would do
that.

953
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:21,130
Where's the white tee shirt?
And uh,

954
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:23,250
you know,
like every day I was like his outfit.

955
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,780
So uniform.
When he goes to work,

956
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,060
does he wear it?
Like when he goes out and dates only

957
00:36:27,061 --> 00:36:29,430
that one teacher that I don't know,
but there's definitely [inaudible]

958
00:36:29,431 --> 00:36:33,570
amount of days.
What's up that vagina for me.

959
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:37,200
Yeah.
But like there is people like that that

960
00:36:37,201 --> 00:36:40,740
like only wear certain things.
Like this dude isn't just in badly in

961
00:36:40,741 --> 00:36:42,750
need of a joint.
I keep telling him,

962
00:36:42,751 --> 00:36:43,351
I go,
dude,

963
00:36:43,351 --> 00:36:45,420
just trust me man.
Just trust me.

964
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:48,750
Just try a little weed.
It'll help you relax.

965
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,420
Like you're a good guy.
He got a lot of good things going on.

966
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,460
He just needed a little fresh
perspective man.

967
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:57,090
And it's totally true.
You had a live proofing the other day on

968
00:36:57,091 --> 00:36:58,620
that podcast,
98.

969
00:36:58,740 --> 00:36:59,960
You remember?
It's like you just need some muck.

970
00:36:59,961 --> 00:37:02,250
We immediately after smoking weed,
everything was great.

971
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:06,300
You know,
every podcast 98 Aka the disaster

972
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,940
disaster.
Brian Whittaker apparently is very upset

973
00:37:08,941 --> 00:37:13,080
with the depictions of him from that
podcast tweeting mean things to you.

974
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:15,210
Yeah,
he started attacking me on Twitter just

975
00:37:15,211 --> 00:37:16,440
like today.
It's like,

976
00:37:16,441 --> 00:37:17,610
dude,
all right.

977
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:22,690
The thing I'm saying is I'm trying to
make sure that people that are at home

978
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:26,130
can listen to this podcast and
understand what's going on.

979
00:37:26,131 --> 00:37:28,410
Instead of having a million people
talking at once.

980
00:37:28,411 --> 00:37:30,660
It was no attack on you.
I understand what you're saying.

981
00:37:30,661 --> 00:37:33,290
So for the people that don't know about
that podcast and it's not worth

982
00:37:33,291 --> 00:37:34,290
listening to,
it wasn't a good one.

983
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,400
But,
um,

984
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:38,160
there was just,
he just had an issue where he didn't

985
00:37:38,161 --> 00:37:39,400
know how to,
uh,

986
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:41,490
be on a podcast.
He didn't know that you can't talk while

987
00:37:41,491 --> 00:37:43,570
other people are talking.
It wasn't,

988
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:45,690
you know,
he didn't have a chance to prepare.

989
00:37:45,691 --> 00:37:47,040
It just got thrown into it.
You know,

990
00:37:47,041 --> 00:37:48,360
he didn't even know he was going to be
doing it.

991
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:49,890
We've talked about him too much.
Yeah.

992
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:51,900
We have talked about he's a good dude.
He's just,

993
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:55,320
he's out there doing his thing and it's
taught out there for a pimp.

994
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:57,330
Yeah,
but at least it's easier when you work

995
00:37:57,331 --> 00:37:58,830
at the Improv,
you know you get stage time.

996
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:03,450
Oh is that your dig your last dig at him
because he had a dig at you.

997
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:05,130
You get a lot of people that hate on you
man.

998
00:38:05,131 --> 00:38:07,140
Of course.
I've always had that ever since I

999
00:38:07,141 --> 00:38:08,580
started talking to you,
I haven't been getting haters.

1000
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:09,960
You started talking to me.

1001
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:14,280
Oh Man.
People don't want to respect the red

1002
00:38:14,281 --> 00:38:17,310
band.
Cause people well that whenever you do

1003
00:38:17,311 --> 00:38:18,960
something,
I mean if you do comedy,

1004
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:20,760
people look at it and got it looks so
easy.

1005
00:38:20,761 --> 00:38:22,500
I can do that too.
And then you ain't even funny.

1006
00:38:22,501 --> 00:38:24,050
I could fucking do that.
But then the,

1007
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:24,884
you know,
they look at you.

1008
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:27,210
What does he know how to make edit some
videos or something.

1009
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:28,860
Fucking I can do that too.
You know,

1010
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:31,050
they just,
they look at someone who's in a nice

1011
00:38:31,051 --> 00:38:32,520
spot and what you think,
what the fuck?

1012
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:35,770
Why isn't that in me?
I know it's hard to not jealous man.

1013
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:36,340
There's some,

1014
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:38,530
some ingrained shit.
I see what my kids,

1015
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:40,990
it's really interesting,
the three year old and the one year old

1016
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,720
I sometimes a three year old would get
upset at the one year old,

1017
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:45,160
the one year old getting too much
attention.

1018
00:38:45,161 --> 00:38:48,010
She'll take things from her and stuff
and it's like they just,

1019
00:38:48,011 --> 00:38:50,920
it's just nature.
Nature wants you that you want to

1020
00:38:50,921 --> 00:38:52,860
collect all that love,
you know?

1021
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,880
That's why people develop great
personalities.

1022
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:57,730
They develop great personalities cause
they realized somewhere along the line,

1023
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,580
you know,
with a rewards is that,

1024
00:39:00,581 --> 00:39:01,810
you know,
when you have a great personality,

1025
00:39:01,811 --> 00:39:03,160
the reward is people are always nice to
you.

1026
00:39:03,161 --> 00:39:05,110
You get all this nice energy that people
want to be around you.

1027
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:08,080
That's the reason why great
personalities getting invented because

1028
00:39:08,081 --> 00:39:10,450
people become a horse for other people's
love.

1029
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:11,980
You know?
I mean that's what really what it is.

1030
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:14,050
I mean it's a,
it's a beautiful thing in both ways,

1031
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:18,130
but really the root of it all is that
people really want positive attention.

1032
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,370
So when you see like little jealousy and
like little kids and then you see

1033
00:39:21,371 --> 00:39:24,970
jealousy and like grown adults.
And I see like really petty shit and

1034
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,700
haters and I love to go on like,
um,

1035
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:28,923
those,
uh,

1036
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:30,490
gossip blogs,
you know,

1037
00:39:30,491 --> 00:39:31,420
and just,
just to read,

1038
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:33,280
I don't even know who these people are,
you know,

1039
00:39:33,281 --> 00:39:36,780
but someone will be someone from the
bachelor or someone from some,

1040
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:38,840
I'd just like to read the comments.
It's just,

1041
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,600
I don't even know what the fuck the
stories about.

1042
00:39:40,601 --> 00:39:41,830
I have the time,
the campaign,

1043
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:44,500
his baby and you have mom and during
court,

1044
00:39:44,501 --> 00:39:45,050
whatever,
whatever,

1045
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:47,100
what's going on in the comments.
And I'd go down to the comments and it's

1046
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:47,943
just,

1047
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:48,561
yeah,
it is.

1048
00:39:48,561 --> 00:39:51,590
Hey evilness.
And it's ridiculous because when people,

1049
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:53,930
the biggest thing is like if it wasn't
for Rogan,

1050
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:54,560
this,
that,

1051
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,250
this and that,
I'm like,

1052
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:57,530
yeah,
if it wasn't for rogue and he saw my

1053
00:39:57,531 --> 00:39:59,150
work,
he liked what I did.

1054
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:01,220
He hired talking about me.
Like I'm not even here.

1055
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:02,450
I know it's,
but,

1056
00:40:02,451 --> 00:40:06,530
but what is like a company like NBC,
but like Jay Leno should,

1057
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:07,510
you know,
people are managing it.

1058
00:40:07,511 --> 00:40:09,590
Like if it wasn't for NBC,
you would be nobody.

1059
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,350
You know,
that's,

1060
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:12,920
it's,
it's me getting Joe seeing my work and

1061
00:40:12,921 --> 00:40:15,170
then hiring me.
I got a job.

1062
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,450
It's really simple.
Was an artist.

1063
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:19,670
Hello.
He's an artist and he was creating

1064
00:40:19,671 --> 00:40:22,680
things that I thought were very
worthwhile and so I hired them.

1065
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:25,400
It's a really simple,
pretty easy and you know,

1066
00:40:25,401 --> 00:40:26,690
and people that,
you know,

1067
00:40:26,691 --> 00:40:29,690
there's a weird dynamic and people like,
how are you guys friends?

1068
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:32,150
You guys are so different.
Like you don't have to be the same as

1069
00:40:32,151 --> 00:40:33,290
your fucking friends,
man.

1070
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:34,580
That's,
that's silly.

1071
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:35,121
Right.
You know,

1072
00:40:35,121 --> 00:40:38,180
if everyone was the same then you know,
I'll be running around saying the same

1073
00:40:38,181 --> 00:40:41,000
shit and cock blocking each other.
This isn't a Paula Abdul opposites

1074
00:40:41,001 --> 00:40:42,410
attract.
Is that what you said?

1075
00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:45,200
I think
I heard forever.

1076
00:40:45,201 --> 00:40:48,800
Your girl the other day miss the music
on the podcast,

1077
00:40:48,801 --> 00:40:49,431
Joe.
Yeah,

1078
00:40:49,431 --> 00:40:50,240
I do too,
man.

1079
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,970
We can't do that shit anymore.
The serious serious deal is signed

1080
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,220
ladies.
Yeah,

1081
00:40:54,221 --> 00:40:54,951
it's all done.
I mean,

1082
00:40:54,951 --> 00:40:58,010
I haven't written my name on it because
they did just to do you.

1083
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:58,791
Do you ever,
I'm just gonna.

1084
00:40:58,791 --> 00:41:00,190
I'm gonna so we're going to have it on
Sirius,

1085
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:02,060
so it'll be 12 episodes.
We have to get ready,

1086
00:41:02,061 --> 00:41:06,200
we have to pull up music if we have
music on and we have to check him back

1087
00:41:06,201 --> 00:41:08,180
episodes.
We're going to send them 12 and then

1088
00:41:08,181 --> 00:41:10,340
we're going to go live episodes that
we've ever done.

1089
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,520
Exit.
Not 12 but what's,

1090
00:41:11,521 --> 00:41:13,360
what's your five top five that you've
ever taught?

1091
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:14,180
Five.
Well,

1092
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,890
my number one favorite,
just just

1093
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:19,740
uh,
just for sheer far out factors.

1094
00:41:19,741 --> 00:41:24,420
Always Dunkin Dunkins my favorite cause
just junk and just so fucking weird.

1095
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,900
And like when he starts chanting
Buddhist mantras and talking to you

1096
00:41:27,901 --> 00:41:30,810
about the Bhagavad Gita and you know,
and he just,

1097
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,250
he just gets me going,
man.

1098
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,520
Dunkin and I,
he doesn't have these conversations he

1099
00:41:34,521 --> 00:41:36,080
says with anybody else either.
He's like,

1100
00:41:36,081 --> 00:41:40,550
he and he and I would have just this
weird chemistry when we get together.

1101
00:41:40,551 --> 00:41:42,320
It's all crazy talking to the other day
I called him up,

1102
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:44,030
call him up yesterday because I said,
hey,

1103
00:41:44,031 --> 00:41:45,920
we're doing the 100th podcast today.
You know,

1104
00:41:45,921 --> 00:41:48,710
maybe you want to like walk in like
halfway in and sit down with us.

1105
00:41:48,711 --> 00:41:51,170
I was thinking like maybe that'd be cool
to have guests come over while we're

1106
00:41:51,171 --> 00:41:52,250
doing it.
And he goes,

1107
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,380
Oh,
I'd love to become,

1108
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:56,150
he's a middle of the show,
these putting together and he goes,

1109
00:41:56,151 --> 00:41:57,770
I did mushrooms last night,
man.

1110
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:00,860
I was surrounded by Elvis.
They have so much to talk to you about.

1111
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:04,660
Yeah,
I was scared to fucking grounded.

1112
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:07,760
He said I was surrounded by Elvis.
He said I did more mushrooms than I've

1113
00:42:07,761 --> 00:42:09,550
ever done.
I was surrounded by El.

1114
00:42:09,551 --> 00:42:12,980
So Dunkin's going to be in the podcast
next week and he's going to tell us this

1115
00:42:12,981 --> 00:42:16,610
whole this whole thing.
And You [inaudible] you recently went

1116
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:17,690
Truman up in

1117
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,210
northern California,
north of Barbara.

1118
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:25,160
Wouldn't the world be a better place if
people just did that if they had

1119
00:42:25,161 --> 00:42:26,120
retreats,
you know,

1120
00:42:26,121 --> 00:42:28,490
instead of going,
I mean even have these wine tasting

1121
00:42:28,491 --> 00:42:30,200
retreats.
How about right next to the wine tasting

1122
00:42:30,201 --> 00:42:32,300
or treats a mushroom tree,
they'd go there.

1123
00:42:32,301 --> 00:42:35,480
Everybody's going to be nice to you.
It's all soothing sounds and you know,

1124
00:42:35,481 --> 00:42:38,990
you're in a comfortable room and there's
the Sharman are all experience.

1125
00:42:38,991 --> 00:42:40,760
Everybody who works here is
professional.

1126
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:42,560
You know,
you pay a couple hundred bucks a day or

1127
00:42:42,561 --> 00:42:46,040
whatever the hell you're doing and you
just blast off.

1128
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:49,610
It's pretty amazing.
How much better wine taste when it's at

1129
00:42:49,611 --> 00:42:51,230
the vineyard.
I don't know why.

1130
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,090
Cause it's all the same.
It's modeled,

1131
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,193
you know?

1132
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:58,790
Well the ones who offer the tours,
are they like really known?

1133
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,001
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

1134
00:43:00,001 --> 00:43:02,670
These are like the big dog.
So you remember the names?

1135
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:04,620
I don't remember anything.
I remember I don't buy,

1136
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:07,340
I usually buy buy wine by the bottle.
Like,

1137
00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:09,390
like if it's got a cool bottle I'll buy
it.

1138
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:12,090
Yeah,
there's kinds of wines I like,

1139
00:43:12,091 --> 00:43:13,290
like I like more Lowe's.
I like,

1140
00:43:13,291 --> 00:43:14,220
you know,
Shit like that.

1141
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:15,810
But I just usually go by the bottle.
Like,

1142
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:16,740
oh,
that's a crazy cat.

1143
00:43:16,741 --> 00:43:17,640
And on that,
you know?

1144
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:19,490
Yeah.
I never used to go.

1145
00:43:19,491 --> 00:43:21,350
I,
if I was a on a date,

1146
00:43:21,351 --> 00:43:25,490
perhaps back in the day I would order a
glass of wine or a bottle of wine,

1147
00:43:25,491 --> 00:43:28,580
but I would never like order a glass of
wine while I was eating dinner.

1148
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:30,180
But now I do all the time.
Yeah,

1149
00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:32,130
I do all the time.
Like I like a,

1150
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:35,270
like a nice strong red wine with like a
steak.

1151
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:37,410
It just tastes better.
It's like this little,

1152
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:39,800
you know,
this is this thing that the flavor is

1153
00:43:39,801 --> 00:43:42,430
all combining.
And as I've gotten like a,

1154
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:46,790
like Matt Lichtenberg,
my buddy is a huge one fanatic.

1155
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:48,470
He's like,
he's a,

1156
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:51,800
he's a wine geek.
I mean he has this crazy wine cellar and

1157
00:43:51,801 --> 00:43:55,400
his home with some insane amount of
money worth of wine in it and he's one

1158
00:43:55,401 --> 00:43:59,690
of those guys that can tell you why a
wine is good and what year it's good and

1159
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:02,300
you know what,
what part of the country had comes from

1160
00:44:02,301 --> 00:44:03,290
and all that kind of shit.

1161
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:06,080
And when,
when you're around a guy like that and

1162
00:44:06,081 --> 00:44:07,400
he,
they know so much about why,

1163
00:44:07,401 --> 00:44:09,490
then you start to sort of appreciate it.
Like,

1164
00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:10,101
oh,
okay,

1165
00:44:10,101 --> 00:44:14,780
this is some weird tasting art form.
It's like they're trying to create this

1166
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:19,250
ultimate taste and it's a very specific
taste and if you're not,

1167
00:44:19,251 --> 00:44:21,500
it's a weird thing.
Like the whole idea of acquired taste.

1168
00:44:21,501 --> 00:44:24,830
I used to think that was so stupid.
Like why would you acquire a taste for

1169
00:44:24,831 --> 00:44:26,930
something like caviar?
The fucking stuff,

1170
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,440
you know it's super expensive and it
really kind of tastes like shit when you

1171
00:44:30,441 --> 00:44:31,830
first take it.
Why wouldn't you just,

1172
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:32,730
okay,
it's,

1173
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:35,170
it tastes like shit forever and this is,
it is what it is.

1174
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,230
I now have to worry about it anymore.
But no,

1175
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:41,010
people get into it and then they start
getting more and more expensive tastes

1176
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:43,200
and you're getting stuff that's
thousands and thousands of dollars.

1177
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:47,730
She's salty fucking stupid fish eggs.
Well wine is kind of like that too.

1178
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,510
And that like the first time you try
wine and I nearly a little kid or

1179
00:44:51,511 --> 00:44:53,190
something like who the fuck would get
into that?

1180
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:58,490
But when you really like get a nice
peanut and war and a delicious steak and

1181
00:44:59,690 --> 00:45:02,910
you're cut into that stigma and then you
have a sip of the wine,

1182
00:45:02,911 --> 00:45:05,310
like Ah,
all the flavors together,

1183
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:09,060
it takes a while to appreciate it.
But knowing someone who knows as much

1184
00:45:09,061 --> 00:45:11,820
about wine as I do,
I mean he tells me so much about,

1185
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:12,440
you know,
like,

1186
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,850
you know,
it's all about like how they put it in,

1187
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:18,720
what kind of barrels they use,
store it and how they store it and how

1188
00:45:18,721 --> 00:45:21,930
long they store it and how long,
how long has it been bottled for.

1189
00:45:21,931 --> 00:45:22,490
And

1190
00:45:22,490 --> 00:45:24,420
it's pretty amazing.
One of the wineries I went to,

1191
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:27,980
they did cheese pairings,
which is cool because you never,

1192
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:28,641
you think,
okay,

1193
00:45:28,641 --> 00:45:30,440
they're going to mix this cheese with
this wine.

1194
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,660
Yay.
It's going to just taste like if I still

1195
00:45:32,661 --> 00:45:34,640
use the word Faggot,
which I don't,

1196
00:45:35,630 --> 00:45:36,820
I might throw it out.
You're right there.

1197
00:45:36,830 --> 00:45:37,870
I'm know.
Be Honest.

1198
00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:42,140
I liked cheese.
You like you like wine?

1199
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,880
I do.
It just sounds fruity.

1200
00:45:43,881 --> 00:45:45,110
Tooty yeah,
it does say,

1201
00:45:45,111 --> 00:45:46,490
oh,
I went to a cheese pairing,

1202
00:45:46,491 --> 00:45:49,280
a wine tasting.
Did you know how wet that pussy gets

1203
00:45:49,281 --> 00:45:51,380
when you're going to a wine and cheese
tasting?

1204
00:45:51,381 --> 00:45:54,950
That's the most ridiculous wet pussy
feel normal for the first time in their

1205
00:45:54,951 --> 00:45:56,180
life.
Normal.

1206
00:45:56,330 --> 00:45:59,660
Brian's a good guy.
He's not taking me to see poison in

1207
00:45:59,661 --> 00:46:00,740
concert.
That's right.

1208
00:46:00,741 --> 00:46:03,110
He's telling me to take you to motel six

1209
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:06,870
so wine tasting in the middle of
Northern California.

1210
00:46:06,871 --> 00:46:08,010
He's an amazing guy.

1211
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:09,460
Cool.
Do you know what,

1212
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:12,190
but you went for the fun of it.
You didn't want,

1213
00:46:12,850 --> 00:46:13,920
it was more like,
Hey,

1214
00:46:13,921 --> 00:46:15,430
want to get away?
Not You.

1215
00:46:15,431 --> 00:46:16,860
No Internet,
no work.

1216
00:46:16,861 --> 00:46:18,930
I just don't like up there.
It's beautiful.

1217
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:22,230
It's the crazy mountains.
There's a huge lake.

1218
00:46:22,231 --> 00:46:23,790
At one point,
I forget the name of it,

1219
00:46:23,791 --> 00:46:27,870
right north of Santa Barbara is this
humongous lake where it's just best

1220
00:46:27,871 --> 00:46:30,030
fishing.
I can know other families up there or is

1221
00:46:30,031 --> 00:46:32,040
it just,
there's my soul families.

1222
00:46:32,041 --> 00:46:34,770
I saw families,
but a lot of bed and breakfast is a lot

1223
00:46:34,771 --> 00:46:37,770
of Nice historic old hotels.
You know that,

1224
00:46:37,771 --> 00:46:40,050
that that you go in and there's just
like every room is unique.

1225
00:46:40,051 --> 00:46:42,450
That's what we stayed at this place
called Peterson.

1226
00:46:42,451 --> 00:46:45,960
At the end or the inn at Peterson.
Is this amazing Santa Ynez?

1227
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:46,920
Yes.
Yes.

1228
00:46:46,921 --> 00:46:49,800
Right next to Tom.
Like is he used to always rant and rave.

1229
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,800
It's amazing.
There was ostrich farms where,

1230
00:46:52,801 --> 00:46:55,980
which is huge fields of ostriches
running around.

1231
00:46:55,981 --> 00:46:58,920
You can go there and you can get like
ostrich eggs and like hang out with

1232
00:46:58,921 --> 00:47:00,720
ostriches,
but they're were running around.

1233
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:03,180
They look like dinosaurs.
They look like it's,

1234
00:47:03,181 --> 00:47:04,230
it's amazing,
man.

1235
00:47:04,231 --> 00:47:07,470
I highly recommend if you just want a
weekend out out of La,

1236
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:09,480
take the kids,
go go to some farms.

1237
00:47:09,481 --> 00:47:11,380
It's,
it's pretty relaxing Jeff.

1238
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:13,480
Ostriches or creepy as fuck man.
Yeah.

1239
00:47:13,590 --> 00:47:15,220
All birds are creepy as fuck.
Yeah,

1240
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:16,920
and around about it.
About,

1241
00:47:16,921 --> 00:47:19,050
you know,
in my act a little bit about the mass

1242
00:47:19,051 --> 00:47:22,230
bird deaths that happened,
but how about how birds are really

1243
00:47:22,231 --> 00:47:24,540
dinosaurs that survived,
but they really are.

1244
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,120
I mean that's,
that's the closest relative to the

1245
00:47:27,121 --> 00:47:30,580
dinosaur is the bird and an ostrich is a
fucking dinosaur.

1246
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:35,170
It's a big ass weird looking dinosaur
with the tastes delicious.

1247
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:38,320
You ever get the off Times Burger?
Fuddruckers wow.

1248
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:40,280
Strong.
Yeah.

1249
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:42,550
I'll buy you a coke.
You got to have it rare though.

1250
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:45,160
Don't be a pussy.
You don't have to worry about mad cow

1251
00:47:45,161 --> 00:47:48,150
with those bitches.
Just get that shit rare fired up.

1252
00:47:48,151 --> 00:47:53,140
Fuck her up or I feel that that raw rare
ostrich meat.

1253
00:47:53,141 --> 00:47:55,750
So delicious man.
It's good stuff.

1254
00:47:55,751 --> 00:47:58,180
Would you go camping here in La tent
camping?

1255
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:00,610
Shit,
when they go camping where I can drive

1256
00:48:00,611 --> 00:48:02,520
home.
The only time I would go camping is on

1257
00:48:02,530 --> 00:48:05,020
too far away to drive home.
And if I have guns on me,

1258
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:07,540
I'm going hunting with Ricky Schroder
are you really?

1259
00:48:07,541 --> 00:48:08,374
Yeah,
we're going,

1260
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:12,550
we're going to this ranch where you
could shoot bore and uh,

1261
00:48:12,630 --> 00:48:16,900
they even have bison at this ranch and
it's like you pay them for whatever you

1262
00:48:16,901 --> 00:48:18,610
shoot and then you'd go out into their
Dev,

1263
00:48:18,611 --> 00:48:23,260
this giant hunk of property out near
Riverside out near a San Diego that way.

1264
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:25,180
And so I'm going,
oh,

1265
00:48:25,181 --> 00:48:26,320
that's cool man.
Yeah.

1266
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:28,570
I've been wanting to go for a while.
I'm supposed to go hunting in October

1267
00:48:28,571 --> 00:48:32,050
with Randy couture,
natural Randy coture.

1268
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:34,240
We're going for a TV show.
So,

1269
00:48:34,241 --> 00:48:35,830
uh,
before that I'm going to get some in

1270
00:48:35,831 --> 00:48:38,020
with Ricky.
That guy loves hunting,

1271
00:48:38,021 --> 00:48:38,710
man.
He got,

1272
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:40,810
when I talked to him about his eyes lit
up and everything,

1273
00:48:40,930 --> 00:48:44,620
he wants to come back on the podcast.
I was going to say Ricky to me was one

1274
00:48:44,621 --> 00:48:45,550
of my favorites.
Uh,

1275
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:48,580
I got some great stories are always that
out of nowhere.

1276
00:48:48,581 --> 00:48:51,490
People like the Ricky Schroder or even
Kim prayer.

1277
00:48:51,491 --> 00:48:53,290
I think it was one of my favorite ones
of all time.

1278
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,690
Kevin was awesome.
Rick has got some interesting stuff

1279
00:48:55,691 --> 00:48:56,620
going on right now too,
man.

1280
00:48:56,621 --> 00:48:59,020
He just got some serious skin cancer
removed from his face.

1281
00:48:59,021 --> 00:48:59,854
Serious.
Yeah.

1282
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:02,890
You gotta be people walking around
outside without sunscreen,

1283
00:49:02,891 --> 00:49:03,130
man.

1284
00:49:03,130 --> 00:49:05,640
Be fucking careful.
If you see some little mark on you,

1285
00:49:05,641 --> 00:49:07,900
man,
people die from weird skin.

1286
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,250
You know little things when you're out
there getting burned,

1287
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,760
you don't think it's a big deal.
And then you get melanoma.

1288
00:49:12,790 --> 00:49:14,620
He had a big chunk of his face removed.
Man,

1289
00:49:15,070 --> 00:49:17,680
he's got a big scar right on his temple.
Did you get checked a lot?

1290
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:18,491
Yeah.
Well,

1291
00:49:18,491 --> 00:49:21,100
I don't,
I'm not at risk because I'm fairly dark

1292
00:49:21,101 --> 00:49:22,720
skin.
I get Tan pretty leads easily,

1293
00:49:22,721 --> 00:49:25,360
but I don't fuck around the sun man.
But he's,

1294
00:49:25,361 --> 00:49:26,920
Rick is Rick,
he's Pale.

1295
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:28,390
He's like white,
like paper,

1296
00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:30,550
you know,
you gotta be careful as fuck and he's

1297
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:33,420
always out in the sun.
He's like mister outdoorsy,

1298
00:49:33,430 --> 00:49:35,380
you know,
he's got this giant piece of property

1299
00:49:35,381 --> 00:49:38,890
and he's got property in Colorado.
Ricky Ricky Schroeder is an interesting

1300
00:49:38,891 --> 00:49:39,610
guy,
man.

1301
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:41,350
He's a super outdoorsmen character.

1302
00:49:41,350 --> 00:49:44,680
He's always out there like chopping wood
and shit and getting things done.

1303
00:49:44,810 --> 00:49:45,311
You know,
he's like,

1304
00:49:45,311 --> 00:49:47,440
he looked like wishes he lives on a farm
or something like that.

1305
00:49:47,441 --> 00:49:51,010
I think growing up poor or rather
growing up super rich,

1306
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:54,100
I mean growing up rich and famous from
the time it's early as he can remember,

1307
00:49:54,101 --> 00:49:58,180
he was a celebrity and he was rich.
So he's always had so much fucking money

1308
00:49:58,181 --> 00:50:00,490
that I think he likes driving around in
pickup trucks.

1309
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:03,610
He likes like doing like manual labor
and shit like that.

1310
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:05,710
But when you do that,
you've got to put your sunscreen on

1311
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:08,500
homing,
especially California out here,

1312
00:50:08,501 --> 00:50:10,870
this fucking heat.
And the sun constantly beaten down on

1313
00:50:10,871 --> 00:50:12,430
you.
People get cancer,

1314
00:50:12,490 --> 00:50:14,140
you gotta be careful.
I have a bunch of moles.

1315
00:50:14,141 --> 00:50:16,030
I'm a very Molly motherfucker,
but uh,

1316
00:50:16,070 --> 00:50:20,620
my mom's had a few cutout and so yeah.
So I recently went and because there's

1317
00:50:20,621 --> 00:50:23,830
this one that I have on my back that
always is like crunchy,

1318
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:25,620
you know,
it's kind of,

1319
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:26,880
it's,
it's like it's a song.

1320
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:27,973
Yeah,
it's not good.

1321
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:30,350
It's not crunchy.
It just fuels like different than all

1322
00:50:30,351 --> 00:50:31,250
the other ones,
you know.

1323
00:50:31,251 --> 00:50:33,410
And sometimes you know,
if that was your problem,

1324
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:37,030
they pull that out and all of sudden
point you get think clear and right and

1325
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:38,610
start going to the gym.
I just,

1326
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:42,520
that the mold was like a little vampire
just sucking the life out of you.

1327
00:50:42,550 --> 00:50:43,580
So I went there and she's like,
no,

1328
00:50:43,581 --> 00:50:44,750
that's fine.
It's normal.

1329
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:45,651
And I'm like,
really?

1330
00:50:45,651 --> 00:50:46,750
That's why is it?
No,

1331
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:48,830
that's just the kind it is or whatever.
And she,

1332
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:50,350
then she showed me pictures.
Like if it ever,

1333
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:52,370
it looks like this,
come back,

1334
00:50:52,430 --> 00:50:54,650
what's in you gotta say Annie Oakley
Style.

1335
00:50:54,651 --> 00:50:56,180
Look at your back with a mirror.
Exactly.

1336
00:50:56,181 --> 00:50:57,740
What the fuck is that about?
What is it?

1337
00:50:57,741 --> 00:50:59,450
What is it supposed to look like when
it's bad?

1338
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:01,430
It's like,
it's like right around it.

1339
00:51:01,431 --> 00:51:03,130
It looks kind of like it.

1340
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:04,580
When she showed me,
I was like,

1341
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:05,480
Oh yeah,
yeah,

1342
00:51:05,481 --> 00:51:06,860
that looks bad.
You know?

1343
00:51:06,890 --> 00:51:09,950
Not this little,
no mold as a little flaky or whatever.

1344
00:51:10,730 --> 00:51:12,260
Yeah.
When are they going to fix that?

1345
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:13,790
Molds can kill you.
Yeah.

1346
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:16,160
Keep a good eye and your mole because it
might be a bomb.

1347
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:19,370
How are you supposed to see that?
Especially if you go to in a weird

1348
00:51:19,371 --> 00:51:20,900
place,
like what if he died of a mold?

1349
00:51:20,901 --> 00:51:23,920
It was like right near your asshole who
looks in the Russell,

1350
00:51:24,310 --> 00:51:26,840
you know assholes.
Then in hotel rooms,

1351
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:29,000
that's like girl's ass all.
You look at a girl's house,

1352
00:51:29,001 --> 00:51:31,730
so if you're banging her from behind,
what do you look at your own in a hotel

1353
00:51:31,731 --> 00:51:33,350
room,
because that's the only time when

1354
00:51:33,351 --> 00:51:36,290
there's good lighting and good mirrors.
I'll sit on the counter and just like

1355
00:51:36,291 --> 00:51:37,430
fucking sprayed open and go,
oh,

1356
00:51:37,431 --> 00:51:38,300
look at my butthole.

1357
00:51:38,570 --> 00:51:40,060
Really?
Once in a while you should check it out

1358
00:51:40,061 --> 00:51:41,680
and just to look at it.
I mean,

1359
00:51:41,681 --> 00:51:42,830
when's the last time you looked at your
butthole?

1360
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:44,030
It's been a long time.
Exactly.

1361
00:51:44,031 --> 00:51:48,080
What have you opened it up and there was
this big purple signals from it.

1362
00:51:48,110 --> 00:51:50,210
If it's sending me signals saying
there's something wrong,

1363
00:51:50,270 --> 00:51:52,970
constant itching,
weird noises,

1364
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,640
then I'll go check it out.
Like an itchy asshole.

1365
00:51:54,670 --> 00:51:57,170
Have you ever had an itchy household?
Like for like a couple of days it was

1366
00:51:57,171 --> 00:51:59,410
just nonstop UK,
but also a Dane Cook.

1367
00:51:59,411 --> 00:52:03,820
But that's weird how Dan Cook Louie Ck.
Very Common Joe.

1368
00:52:04,070 --> 00:52:05,800
That does happen.
I actually,

1369
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:08,390
we've all had itchy assholes.
I was thinking about itchy assholes and

1370
00:52:08,391 --> 00:52:08,840
I was like,
oh wait.

1371
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:09,531
Oh yeah,
that's right.

1372
00:52:09,531 --> 00:52:11,870
There's like 3000 jokes for I could she,
I suppose.

1373
00:52:12,050 --> 00:52:13,070
Yeah,
there's quite a few.

1374
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:17,690
I mean the issue with Dane and Louis
obviously was that we really had done it

1375
00:52:17,691 --> 00:52:18,524
first.

1376
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:22,950
Yeah.
But hold jokes are quite common.

1377
00:52:23,030 --> 00:52:25,410
Yeah.
If you,

1378
00:52:25,411 --> 00:52:28,750
uh,
if you think about a subject and it's a,

1379
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:31,740
an obvious subject for a joke,
chances are someone's already done a

1380
00:52:31,741 --> 00:52:33,270
hundred jokes on it.
You know,

1381
00:52:33,330 --> 00:52:34,530
you know,
when I looked up the other day,

1382
00:52:34,770 --> 00:52:35,550
you know,
I was,

1383
00:52:35,550 --> 00:52:38,180
I'm writing this chapter in my book,
um,

1384
00:52:38,250 --> 00:52:40,410
and it has to do with porn.
And so why,

1385
00:52:40,411 --> 00:52:42,720
uh,
I was talking about the moment that I

1386
00:52:42,721 --> 00:52:45,810
realized that the Internet was taking
porn to a whole new level was the

1387
00:52:45,811 --> 00:52:47,940
moment,
I forget who it was,

1388
00:52:47,941 --> 00:52:50,730
it might've been,
Duncan sent me an email and the email

1389
00:52:50,731 --> 00:52:53,880
heading said home run.
And then I opened up the email and it

1390
00:52:53,881 --> 00:52:56,820
just said,
I love people in all capital letters and

1391
00:52:56,821 --> 00:52:59,340
a link.
So I clicked the link and it opens up,

1392
00:52:59,341 --> 00:53:02,340
it's Bella,
Donna on all fours with a baseball bat

1393
00:53:02,341 --> 00:53:06,810
stuffed in her asshole.
I mean it's stuffed in there and fat and

1394
00:53:06,811 --> 00:53:08,790
first,
which I didn't even think was possible

1395
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:13,410
and I remember doubled face palming like
the home alone kid and going,

1396
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:15,600
this bitch is just taking shit to
another level.

1397
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:19,110
She stuffed at baseball and then I
thought about it or is she taking it to

1398
00:53:19,111 --> 00:53:22,560
another level?
And I went and did a Google search and

1399
00:53:22,561 --> 00:53:26,220
there's 2,000,800 hits

1400
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:28,110
for baseball bat in the ass.
Yeah,

1401
00:53:28,410 --> 00:53:29,940
it's,
it's normal and you know,

1402
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:32,700
it's normal shit.
No,

1403
00:53:32,701 --> 00:53:33,271
you know,
when she,

1404
00:53:33,271 --> 00:53:34,170
uh,
when she did that,

1405
00:53:34,171 --> 00:53:34,621
she,
uh,

1406
00:53:34,621 --> 00:53:38,640
used to tweet about that where she was
stretching it out for like a whole week.

1407
00:53:38,641 --> 00:53:40,500
Like I got a big anal scene,
you know.

1408
00:53:40,501 --> 00:53:43,590
And so she had like all these butt plugs
and she just spent the week getting

1409
00:53:43,591 --> 00:53:46,220
ready for doing shit like that.
You know,

1410
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:48,630
she doesn't do porn anymore.
I heard,

1411
00:53:48,631 --> 00:53:49,530
I heard she retired.

1412
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:53,760
Well she had that really sad interview.
I don't remember what it was for,

1413
00:53:53,761 --> 00:53:56,790
whether it was Nightline or one of those
shows,

1414
00:53:56,791 --> 00:53:58,050
but you know,
when they,

1415
00:53:58,110 --> 00:53:58,710
they,
you know,

1416
00:53:58,710 --> 00:54:00,810
they made her feel bad about it and you
know,

1417
00:54:00,811 --> 00:54:01,710
and they asked her,
you know,

1418
00:54:01,711 --> 00:54:04,590
what happened to you?
How did you become this porn star?

1419
00:54:04,591 --> 00:54:06,660
And they kind of like go over her past
and shit like that.

1420
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:08,910
And then at the end she was like,
you know,

1421
00:54:08,911 --> 00:54:10,290
I'm done.
I'm not doing this anymore.

1422
00:54:10,291 --> 00:54:12,990
And then they found out afterward that
she had done some more movies after that

1423
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:15,540
after she said that it was weird.
It was like,

1424
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,370
you know,
you kind of wanted to root for her to

1425
00:54:17,371 --> 00:54:19,890
get out of it and then she's still in it
and it's like,

1426
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:24,300
you know,
fucking not everybody can be a ballet

1427
00:54:24,301 --> 00:54:25,230
instructor.
Okay?

1428
00:54:25,670 --> 00:54:27,300
Some,
some people are going to be porn stars

1429
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:30,450
and by the time they're that age where
they're gonna be porn stars,

1430
00:54:30,870 --> 00:54:32,910
man,
the least of their problems,

1431
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:33,960
it's fucking on film.

1432
00:54:33,990 --> 00:54:36,570
That's the least of their problems is
that baseball in their ass,

1433
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:39,850
that's the least of their problems.
The big problem is what?

1434
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:43,380
What have you become that you're letting
someone put a baseball bat and your ass

1435
00:54:43,381 --> 00:54:45,270
what has happened to you to get you to
this point?

1436
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:47,490
It's not the bad itself.
That's not the real issue.

1437
00:54:47,670 --> 00:54:48,490
It's who,
who,

1438
00:54:48,490 --> 00:54:50,850
who are you?
Like what kind of a strange person are

1439
00:54:50,851 --> 00:54:52,110
you that you,
you know,

1440
00:54:52,111 --> 00:54:55,380
you've got your ass hole up in the air
and there's a giant log in it,

1441
00:54:55,381 --> 00:55:00,381
a big fucking bat.
And then there's 2,800,000 hits of that.

1442
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:03,530
Yeah.
But didn't you also think about if that

1443
00:55:03,531 --> 00:55:05,150
only is bad?
If you look,

1444
00:55:05,151 --> 00:55:06,740
if you think it is bad,
you know,

1445
00:55:06,741 --> 00:55:08,900
like if,
I don't think that's good for anybody.

1446
00:55:09,310 --> 00:55:10,340
If it's like,
Hey,

1447
00:55:10,341 --> 00:55:11,091
I could put it.
Yeah,

1448
00:55:11,091 --> 00:55:11,960
I know,
but it's like,

1449
00:55:11,961 --> 00:55:14,000
Hey,
I can put baseball bat and my ass that

1450
00:55:14,001 --> 00:55:15,980
equals $20,000.
Okay.

1451
00:55:16,030 --> 00:55:18,440
Do you think they get paid that much?
Because I don't think they do.

1452
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:19,550
No,
I don't think they do either.

1453
00:55:19,830 --> 00:55:22,500
It's a couple of grand if they're lucky
and I think that might have been during

1454
00:55:22,501 --> 00:55:23,450
the Hay day.
Yeah.

1455
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:24,960
You know,
I think nowadays I don't,

1456
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:25,530
you know,
those,

1457
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:28,140
those girls were getting like half
million dollar vivid deals.

1458
00:55:28,410 --> 00:55:31,070
You remember,
I remember hanging out with Gemma

1459
00:55:31,070 --> 00:55:34,410
Jamison's husband and he was a producer
and he was giving me the whole skinny on

1460
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:36,180
how much money there is in the porn
industry.

1461
00:55:36,181 --> 00:55:37,080
And this dude,
you know,

1462
00:55:37,410 --> 00:55:39,540
he had all the numbers and I was like,
dad is incredible.

1463
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:42,450
Like there was so much money.
And then the net came along,

1464
00:55:42,451 --> 00:55:46,150
the Internet just robbed them all,
sucked it all away.

1465
00:55:46,170 --> 00:55:47,003
And now,
I mean,

1466
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:48,270
how the fuck do you make money?

1467
00:55:48,490 --> 00:55:49,580
No.
Doing porn I think.

1468
00:55:49,690 --> 00:55:51,970
I think there's definitely still money
there.

1469
00:55:51,971 --> 00:55:55,240
It's more of you just have to do more.
Like I know a lot of these girls they'll

1470
00:55:55,241 --> 00:55:55,961
do like,
you know,

1471
00:55:55,961 --> 00:55:58,630
like a spanking video and make 500 then
they'll,

1472
00:55:58,631 --> 00:56:00,880
you know,
do another video later that day where

1473
00:56:00,970 --> 00:56:04,210
it's just them masturbating and they get
a thousand you know,

1474
00:56:04,211 --> 00:56:05,830
so it's like,
then you think of it that way.

1475
00:56:05,831 --> 00:56:08,260
It's like all right,
you just made $2,000 today and is it for

1476
00:56:08,261 --> 00:56:09,320
a website?
Is that what it spends?

1477
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:10,720
Most of these are websites,
you know,

1478
00:56:10,721 --> 00:56:13,150
fetters websites or you know,
exchanging content.

1479
00:56:13,230 --> 00:56:14,080
And I think that the,
the,

1480
00:56:14,081 --> 00:56:16,480
the weirdest thing about knowing all
these porn stars,

1481
00:56:16,481 --> 00:56:18,820
I think the saddest thing is not even
what,

1482
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:21,670
how they got into it or that they do it.
Cause I don't have a problem with it.

1483
00:56:21,671 --> 00:56:24,220
Is that their future?
Because a lot of them don't have

1484
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:27,080
it.
An idea once that one.

1485
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:29,080
Yeah,
they're like fighters.

1486
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:31,330
I mean is that where you go to,
you know,

1487
00:56:31,331 --> 00:56:34,240
like a truck stop and that really older
woman then you're just like,

1488
00:56:34,241 --> 00:56:36,850
wow,
she used to be a playboy bunny,

1489
00:56:36,910 --> 00:56:37,760
you know,
you know,

1490
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:39,400
look this,
this avenue,

1491
00:56:39,401 --> 00:56:43,030
this Internet avenue has opened up the
door to the point where there's way,

1492
00:56:43,031 --> 00:56:45,040
way,
way more porn stars than there ever were

1493
00:56:45,041 --> 00:56:46,450
back in the day.
You know.

1494
00:56:46,451 --> 00:56:49,210
And porn is so much more available.
When I was a kid,

1495
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:51,820
there was the way you got porn was
magazines.

1496
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:55,000
When I was a kid,
VHS has came out while I was in high

1497
00:56:55,001 --> 00:56:56,080
school.
I remember we got one,

1498
00:56:56,081 --> 00:56:58,270
it was like a big deal at our house,
you know.

1499
00:56:58,271 --> 00:57:00,880
And uh,
my dad had a couple of my step father,

1500
00:57:00,890 --> 00:57:03,910
a couple of porns laying around the
house too and got to watch those too.

1501
00:57:03,910 --> 00:57:05,170
And I was like,
what the hell is this?

1502
00:57:05,171 --> 00:57:06,160
You know,
to go from like,

1503
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:09,130
it never existed.
Or every now and then you saw a magazine

1504
00:57:09,250 --> 00:57:13,610
and the weird thing about those
magazines where they had rules so you

1505
00:57:13,611 --> 00:57:16,780
would buy a porn magazine,
but there was rules and one of the rules

1506
00:57:16,781 --> 00:57:20,920
was the man couldn't have a hard on.
They still have those roles really?

1507
00:57:20,921 --> 00:57:21,570
Yeah,
like word,

1508
00:57:21,570 --> 00:57:25,180
they can't show insertion and you know
in certain magazines and magazines they

1509
00:57:25,181 --> 00:57:26,014
can.
Yeah.

1510
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:29,230
But back then it was all magazines.
Back then there was no magazines that

1511
00:57:29,231 --> 00:57:33,020
showed hard ons and I think,
I mean none that you could find and it

1512
00:57:33,030 --> 00:57:33,641
was like,
you know,

1513
00:57:33,641 --> 00:57:35,650
you'd asked the guy at the counter if
you were bold,

1514
00:57:35,710 --> 00:57:36,850
you know the,
the bookstore,

1515
00:57:36,851 --> 00:57:38,740
but you didn't really want to ask them
like,

1516
00:57:38,741 --> 00:57:40,030
hey,
how come nobody's Dicks hard?

1517
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:41,340
What's going on here?
You know,

1518
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:44,620
you don't really bring it up to him.
But there was always like these weird

1519
00:57:44,621 --> 00:57:49,120
poses where there would be in like,
not just one but like 20 different

1520
00:57:49,121 --> 00:57:50,920
poses.
And in each one of them,

1521
00:57:51,070 --> 00:57:54,760
the girls like moaning,
like she's an XC and the dude doesn't

1522
00:57:54,761 --> 00:57:56,200
have a hard on.
Again,

1523
00:57:56,201 --> 00:57:57,160
every one of them.
It's like,

1524
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:59,740
what is the message that the trend is
send you?

1525
00:57:59,950 --> 00:58:01,330
You know,
what is the message that they're trying

1526
00:58:01,331 --> 00:58:05,050
to send you?
Is it that this is just how the universe

1527
00:58:05,051 --> 00:58:08,380
works and that women that are way hotter
than you could ever possibly imagine?

1528
00:58:08,381 --> 00:58:11,440
We'll always wind up with gay guys and
you're going to be alone by yourself,

1529
00:58:11,590 --> 00:58:13,340
jerking off on to pictures of them.
I mean,

1530
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:15,880
is that what it is?
What is the message?

1531
00:58:16,030 --> 00:58:19,210
Why can't they have hard ons?
They're naked and they're there and then

1532
00:58:19,211 --> 00:58:21,970
the,
the surreality of it all comes into play

1533
00:58:21,971 --> 00:58:25,630
because you see all these 20 different
scenes like this pitch is not giving up

1534
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:27,010
in every scene.

1535
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:30,280
She's super enthusiastic.
She seems nonjudgmental.

1536
00:58:30,310 --> 00:58:32,800
This guy can't get it up and she's doing
everything for him.

1537
00:58:32,801 --> 00:58:35,140
She's posing,
she's got her ass up in the air.

1538
00:58:35,230 --> 00:58:37,150
She's lying on her back with her legs
spread,

1539
00:58:37,151 --> 00:58:41,200
sucking on her fingers.
She's letting him pick her up and he's

1540
00:58:41,201 --> 00:58:43,060
holding her by the hand and his dick
still limp.

1541
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:46,810
It's still limp and this bitch is just
therefore him the whole way.

1542
00:58:46,930 --> 00:58:49,810
She's like soup somewhat.
Eventually he's going to get a hard on.

1543
00:58:49,811 --> 00:58:52,540
I know it.
I just keep posing for him until she's

1544
00:58:52,541 --> 00:58:55,780
in all these weird poses and never loses
interest.

1545
00:58:56,050 --> 00:58:57,100
Never has the,
you know,

1546
00:58:57,101 --> 00:58:58,960
it should be like at least the 18th or
19th posts.

1547
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:00,310
She should be like,
what the fuck?

1548
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:02,860
Like what's going on?
Like why do you have my legs split

1549
00:59:02,861 --> 00:59:06,070
spread and you know you're laying your
limp dick on my pelvis.

1550
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:07,420
Right.
You know,

1551
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:10,450
like,
like a drowning victim just pulled the

1552
00:59:10,451 --> 00:59:12,430
shore and it was just like slop.
I mean,

1553
00:59:12,431 --> 00:59:14,620
that's what it's like.
He's got his limp Dick and he's laying

1554
00:59:14,621 --> 00:59:16,990
it on her pelvis.
Like who is that for?

1555
00:59:16,991 --> 00:59:20,530
Like W W who,
who doesn't want hard dicks?

1556
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:21,610
Like who was,
who was there?

1557
00:59:21,611 --> 00:59:23,750
It was like,
this is where it says why we draw the

1558
00:59:23,751 --> 00:59:26,240
line.
You'll want to get all naked and crazy

1559
00:59:26,241 --> 00:59:28,940
and pretend you're fucking so,
if you had to look at a dick who was

1560
00:59:28,941 --> 00:59:31,580
either hard or lamp,
you would pick hard all the time.

1561
00:59:32,690 --> 00:59:34,850
If I had to look at a dick.
It depends.

1562
00:59:34,851 --> 00:59:38,600
If competing off,
the last thing you want to do is be

1563
00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:42,960
beating off to a dude with a limp Dick.
So you would rather have a hard dick.

1564
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:45,740
Can't even imagine that.
That would feel good.

1565
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:49,460
You'd feel like that the guy would be
embarrassed and that it feels pointless

1566
00:59:49,461 --> 00:59:51,770
and she's,
she doesn't feel good because he's not

1567
00:59:51,771 --> 00:59:52,580
even excited.

1568
00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:54,410
And so there's a lot of like weird
chicken on there.

1569
00:59:54,590 --> 00:59:57,110
At least if the guy has an erection
while he's feeling good,

1570
00:59:57,111 --> 00:59:57,950
it feels good.
And Elise,

1571
00:59:58,070 --> 00:59:59,750
she's happy that she can give him an
erection.

1572
00:59:59,780 --> 01:00:02,870
It's a much more positive experience.
Is it harder for you if the tick is

1573
01:00:02,871 --> 01:00:06,350
black or white?
I can't really relate to black decks.

1574
01:00:06,380 --> 01:00:07,480
See,
I always like,

1575
01:00:07,550 --> 01:00:09,710
I can relate to a black dick if it's
big,

1576
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:11,960
but,
and then a little tiny micro white dick.

1577
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:16,100
I'd rather have hard black Dick fucking
a girl because for some reason to me

1578
01:00:16,101 --> 01:00:18,000
that's more naughtier or something like
that.

1579
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:20,200
Take that big black Dick,
you know?

1580
01:00:20,270 --> 01:00:21,050
Really?
Yeah.

1581
01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:22,760
Really.
So you find yourself saying that as

1582
01:00:22,761 --> 01:00:24,700
you're doing the stroking moment,
why whisper it

1583
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:30,830
for real?
That makes you,

1584
01:00:30,831 --> 01:00:32,210
it makes it more naughty deal.
Yeah.

1585
01:00:32,211 --> 01:00:33,150
It just seems like you're,
Oh,

1586
01:00:33,170 --> 01:00:34,900
you're getting fucked for realsies.

1587
01:00:34,970 --> 01:00:38,830
I remember some girls for real,
some girl came to the comedy store one

1588
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:39,810
night and she,
uh,

1589
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:41,780
gave us the rules of,
uh,

1590
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:43,820
of being a porn star.
She was with,

1591
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:45,890
I think she was with Ron Jeremy,
and she was like,

1592
01:00:46,010 --> 01:00:48,680
you know,
rule number one is don't fuck black guys

1593
01:00:48,681 --> 01:00:50,270
until they pay you.
You have to,

1594
01:00:50,271 --> 01:00:52,550
you can't do it right away.
Don't fuck them until they pay you.

1595
01:00:52,790 --> 01:00:55,430
Rule number two is no angel for a long
time.

1596
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:57,740
You've got to keep it.
Keep it to yourself.

1597
01:00:58,160 --> 01:00:59,780
I'm like,
you have strategies on what you'll hold

1598
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:01,040
back when you do a porn.
Oh yeah,

1599
01:01:01,041 --> 01:01:02,180
honey,
it's a business.

1600
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:03,320
Oh yeah,
honey,

1601
01:01:03,530 --> 01:01:05,030
it's a business.
Wow.

1602
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:07,490
Yeah.
I think they strategize when to give up

1603
01:01:07,550 --> 01:01:10,280
for the black deck.
You can't just right away start fucking

1604
01:01:10,281 --> 01:01:11,280
black guys.
Hey,

1605
01:01:11,281 --> 01:01:11,961
hey,
hey,

1606
01:01:11,961 --> 01:01:13,280
hey.
Settle into that.

1607
01:01:13,281 --> 01:01:14,660
A little,
like some girls,

1608
01:01:14,661 --> 01:01:16,580
like,
like Jenna Jameson never fucked a black

1609
01:01:16,581 --> 01:01:16,770
guy.

1610
01:01:16,770 --> 01:01:17,860
Well that's a big thing.
Important.

1611
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:20,270
Once you go black,
you're actually considered different.

1612
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:21,380
Thrilling.
If you did.

1613
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:22,940
It's like a weird,
so why do girls,

1614
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,980
why did any girls do black guys?
Just,

1615
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,000
I mean,
for their career.

1616
01:01:26,001 --> 01:01:27,680
Why do they do that?
Uh,

1617
01:01:27,710 --> 01:01:29,000
maybe,
I don't know.

1618
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:31,240
I just easy.
Yeah,

1619
01:01:31,670 --> 01:01:33,140
they're just,
they just want to fuck black guys,

1620
01:01:33,141 --> 01:01:33,711
I guess.
Yeah.

1621
01:01:33,711 --> 01:01:34,700
Maybe.
Maybe they don't care.

1622
01:01:34,701 --> 01:01:38,360
Maybe they're there for equal rights.
I guess a lot of the porn buyers are

1623
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:40,470
southern and stuff like that.
And once you fuck a black line,

1624
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:42,740
I don't want that stupid slut.
Please.

1625
01:01:42,741 --> 01:01:46,160
There's a disproportionate amount of all
interracial porn sold in the deep South

1626
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:48,630
said no.
I used to do a whole junk about that.

1627
01:01:48,631 --> 01:01:50,510
That's right.
It's true story.

1628
01:01:50,511 --> 01:01:53,510
It's a true statistic.
Disproportionate amount.

1629
01:01:53,540 --> 01:01:55,490
So then it's not black guys buying him
that stuff.

1630
01:01:55,810 --> 01:01:56,450
It's,
it's,

1631
01:01:56,450 --> 01:02:00,830
it's scared white guys don't where
[inaudible] oh man.

1632
01:02:00,830 --> 01:02:02,060
Okay.
I believe what he's doing,

1633
01:02:02,061 --> 01:02:03,160
or nude or,
oh,

1634
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:05,960
I'll stop looking at me in the eyes.
Stop,

1635
01:02:05,961 --> 01:02:09,150
bitch.
Ooh.

1636
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:11,320
Yeah.
I think that,

1637
01:02:11,321 --> 01:02:13,760
um,
that whole black white thing,

1638
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:16,520
eventually it's going to go away.
I think we're all going to be like one

1639
01:02:16,521 --> 01:02:18,680
strange shade of gray.
You know,

1640
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:21,680
when Moca one something Mexican,
we're going to be Mexican.

1641
01:02:21,681 --> 01:02:25,830
We're going to imagine this.
It's not the black white thing can't

1642
01:02:25,831 --> 01:02:28,230
last.
It only lasted back when people couldn't

1643
01:02:28,231 --> 01:02:31,440
move to other places.
When you were stuck in China and

1644
01:02:31,441 --> 01:02:34,200
everybody else was in China,
what are you fed off the same gene pool

1645
01:02:34,201 --> 01:02:35,970
and you produce Chinese people,
you know,

1646
01:02:35,971 --> 01:02:37,710
but once the Africans got to,
you know,

1647
01:02:37,711 --> 01:02:40,620
the northern Africa and Egypt and things
started getting weird and they took

1648
01:02:40,621 --> 01:02:41,290
over,
you know,

1649
01:02:41,290 --> 01:02:45,540
Cairo and then they move into other
places and then the Moore's hit Sicily

1650
01:02:45,541 --> 01:02:48,330
and then all these fucking,
the Spaniards come over on boats and

1651
01:02:48,331 --> 01:02:49,560
fuck the American Indians.

1652
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:52,770
And then eventually,
eventually we are going to be a world

1653
01:02:52,771 --> 01:02:55,890
culture.
I just don't see how you can keep people

1654
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:58,530
from interbreeding for the next
millennia.

1655
01:02:58,770 --> 01:03:01,770
I just don't see it happen.
I think in the next thousand years we're

1656
01:03:01,771 --> 01:03:03,450
all going to be one shade.
You know,

1657
01:03:03,660 --> 01:03:05,610
they think that's what happened when the
end of the you,

1658
01:03:05,780 --> 01:03:08,400
the,
the talls got assimilated into the

1659
01:03:08,401 --> 01:03:10,500
population.
They used to think they went extinct,

1660
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:13,830
but now they think they sort of went
extinct because women wouldn't fuck

1661
01:03:13,831 --> 01:03:16,050
them.
But men would fuck the women.

1662
01:03:16,530 --> 01:03:19,590
Men,
human men would fuck neanderthal women

1663
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:22,770
and make babies with them.
But Nanda tall men were like,

1664
01:03:22,771 --> 01:03:23,820
what the fuck?
Nothing.

1665
01:03:24,090 --> 01:03:26,580
Nothing.
They just got on the outs.

1666
01:03:27,050 --> 01:03:28,470
Hmm.
That wouldn't be weird.

1667
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:30,480
What would that one final specie look
like?

1668
01:03:30,610 --> 01:03:32,040
Yeah.
Both the end of the road,

1669
01:03:32,041 --> 01:03:34,440
once you make Jesus,
well it's got probably going to look

1670
01:03:34,441 --> 01:03:36,240
like aliens,
you know?

1671
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:38,820
I mean you look at the gray alien,
the model alien,

1672
01:03:38,821 --> 01:03:41,070
this big,
big head and you know,

1673
01:03:41,071 --> 01:03:44,010
sexless body and you know,
and no muscle tone.

1674
01:03:44,370 --> 01:03:48,540
And that's probably the next stage.
I mean,

1675
01:03:48,541 --> 01:03:51,420
if you look at monkeys and then you look
at us and what is the difference?

1676
01:03:51,421 --> 01:03:52,350
Well,
are our heads,

1677
01:03:52,351 --> 01:03:55,980
aren't the monkeys have smaller heads or
heads are bigger,

1678
01:03:56,130 --> 01:03:58,170
our muscles aren't as big,
were softer.

1679
01:03:58,171 --> 01:03:58,801
We're,
we're not.

1680
01:03:58,801 --> 01:04:00,540
We last longer.
We have,

1681
01:04:00,541 --> 01:04:02,700
you know,
nutrition and information and all that

1682
01:04:02,701 --> 01:04:05,130
stuff,
but physically were far weaker than the

1683
01:04:05,131 --> 01:04:06,270
chimps,
you know,

1684
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:08,640
and then,
well then they're going to be more weak

1685
01:04:08,641 --> 01:04:10,680
than us with bigger heads.
They're heads are going to be bigger.

1686
01:04:10,681 --> 01:04:12,450
They're going to be more,
uh,

1687
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:17,100
more smooth and less muscular insinuate
because they're not going to need that.

1688
01:04:17,101 --> 01:04:19,680
They're never going to be in combat and
never going to be fighting for their

1689
01:04:19,681 --> 01:04:22,830
life against other bodies and try to
take down animals to eat them.

1690
01:04:22,830 --> 01:04:23,790
They're moved way,
way,

1691
01:04:23,791 --> 01:04:25,080
way,
way past that shit.

1692
01:04:25,950 --> 01:04:26,780
That's,
I mean,

1693
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:29,880
the,
the human alien connection,

1694
01:04:29,910 --> 01:04:31,080
you know,
for a lot of people,

1695
01:04:31,081 --> 01:04:33,780
they believe that what they're alien
image represents,

1696
01:04:33,781 --> 01:04:37,380
whether it's real or imagined.
What it represents is humans from the

1697
01:04:37,381 --> 01:04:42,090
future and that the eventual
metamorphosis of the human animal,

1698
01:04:42,230 --> 01:04:46,020
the morphing,
the evolving will ultimately lead to

1699
01:04:46,021 --> 01:04:47,010
something like that.
We,

1700
01:04:47,270 --> 01:04:49,920
we look at inherently all our issues.
Well,

1701
01:04:49,921 --> 01:04:53,460
first of all with sexual issues,
we have emotional issues.

1702
01:04:53,461 --> 01:04:54,121
We have,
you know,

1703
01:04:54,121 --> 01:04:56,130
anger issues.
We have all these things,

1704
01:04:56,370 --> 01:04:57,360
well,
the,

1705
01:04:57,390 --> 01:05:01,260
all the depictions of the aliens,
they've gone completely passed all that

1706
01:05:01,261 --> 01:05:03,450
shit.
You eliminate all your,

1707
01:05:03,451 --> 01:05:06,060
your sexual issues.
If you can reproduce,

1708
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:07,520
you know,
outside of a,

1709
01:05:07,580 --> 01:05:09,720
uh,
a male female environment.

1710
01:05:09,721 --> 01:05:11,870
If you're able to reproduce completely
in,

1711
01:05:11,871 --> 01:05:13,650
in laboratories or in,
you know,

1712
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:15,930
petri dishes or whatever the fuck
they're doing.

1713
01:05:16,230 --> 01:05:16,990
You know,
if,

1714
01:05:16,990 --> 01:05:19,540
if we,
if the human animal moves past

1715
01:05:19,541 --> 01:05:21,760
reproduction in a natural way,
I mean,

1716
01:05:21,761 --> 01:05:24,190
that might be,
what if they found out that babies were

1717
01:05:24,191 --> 01:05:28,270
a hundred percent smarter and they live
twice as long and they were,

1718
01:05:28,271 --> 01:05:31,150
you know,
five times more resistant to diseases.

1719
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:35,320
If you raise them in a test tube,
if everybody raised them outside of the

1720
01:05:35,321 --> 01:05:37,060
womb and some new machine that someone
created,

1721
01:05:37,180 --> 01:05:38,380
well,
everyone would want that.

1722
01:05:38,381 --> 01:05:39,760
Why would you want your kid to be
stupid?

1723
01:05:39,761 --> 01:05:41,320
Because you want to carry it around
inside you.

1724
01:05:41,470 --> 01:05:43,750
You selfish cunt,
put the baby in the machine,

1725
01:05:43,860 --> 01:05:45,700
right?
That's what they would do.

1726
01:05:45,701 --> 01:05:48,250
And that's inevitable.
They're going to eventually come up with

1727
01:05:48,251 --> 01:05:51,310
something like that.
The human body can only do so much.

1728
01:05:51,311 --> 01:05:53,260
You know,
the human body there are already

1729
01:05:53,261 --> 01:05:56,830
figuring out artificial parts.
They already devised artificial hearts.

1730
01:05:57,010 --> 01:05:59,890
They've come up with artificial leaves
that make photosynthesis.

1731
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:02,260
They're going to have artificial wounds,
official electricity,

1732
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:05,560
you know,
it's artificial trees going to be able

1733
01:06:05,561 --> 01:06:06,940
to make electricity.
Yeah,

1734
01:06:06,941 --> 01:06:08,050
we're going to be able to make
electricity.

1735
01:06:08,051 --> 01:06:09,550
The solar power.
And it does.

1736
01:06:09,551 --> 01:06:11,650
Another thing that I got from
transcendent man that uh,

1737
01:06:11,651 --> 01:06:14,080
the w the Ray Kurzwell documentary that
I watched,

1738
01:06:14,290 --> 01:06:18,070
fucking awesome shit man,
but he talks about the upcoming advances

1739
01:06:18,071 --> 01:06:19,890
in solar power.
Solar power is going to be the Shim.

1740
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:21,520
It's going to be driving cars,
man,

1741
01:06:21,670 --> 01:06:23,440
they're going to have solar powered cars
or the next 20,

1742
01:06:23,441 --> 01:06:24,520
30 years.
It's,

1743
01:06:24,610 --> 01:06:28,330
it's all,
it all eventually is moving us towards

1744
01:06:28,331 --> 01:06:32,230
the aliens man.
I mean they really might be the ideas

1745
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:33,430
of,
I don't believe,

1746
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:36,580
I don't believe they exist or that they
don't exist.

1747
01:06:36,581 --> 01:06:37,900
I don't believe that,
you know,

1748
01:06:37,901 --> 01:06:41,530
people were really seeing flying saucers
and I don't believe that everything that

1749
01:06:41,531 --> 01:06:43,890
people see is a government spacecraft
there.

1750
01:06:43,890 --> 01:06:46,300
It's very possible.
That could be something from another

1751
01:06:46,301 --> 01:06:48,800
dimension or something from another
world or something from some,

1752
01:06:48,910 --> 01:06:53,350
some even even Hokey,
ridiculous cliche description from like

1753
01:06:53,351 --> 01:06:56,350
a 1950 Scifi movie.
I'm not discounting the possibility of

1754
01:06:56,351 --> 01:06:58,360
that,
but I've looked at all these different

1755
01:06:58,361 --> 01:07:00,600
people that all their stories and all
their d,

1756
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:03,100
it doesn't jive.
It doesn't jive to me.

1757
01:07:03,101 --> 01:07:05,410
I have a,
an awesome bullshit detector.

1758
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:07,630
I'm,
I'm currently reading this John Mac book

1759
01:07:07,631 --> 01:07:11,080
and John Mack was a,
actually a professor at Harvard who a

1760
01:07:11,090 --> 01:07:13,480
start.
He had started doing posts,

1761
01:07:13,690 --> 01:07:14,650
um,
um,

1762
01:07:14,710 --> 01:07:15,820
uh,
past life,

1763
01:07:15,821 --> 01:07:18,410
a hypnotic regression shit with people,
uh,

1764
01:07:18,430 --> 01:07:19,870
you know,
hypnotic regression,

1765
01:07:19,871 --> 01:07:20,621
not,
not past life,

1766
01:07:20,621 --> 01:07:23,380
but in the,
in their past like abduction stuff.

1767
01:07:23,590 --> 01:07:25,720
Cause he,
he was dealing with all these different

1768
01:07:25,721 --> 01:07:28,330
people that had a very,
very similar,

1769
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:31,930
um,
experiences where they were abducted,

1770
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:34,300
you know,
repeatedly over many times in their

1771
01:07:34,301 --> 01:07:35,050
life.

1772
01:07:35,050 --> 01:07:37,030
But I'm looking at the,
the,

1773
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:38,710
the work and I'm reading this stuff and
I'm like,

1774
01:07:38,711 --> 01:07:40,330
God,
this is so embarrassing.

1775
01:07:40,331 --> 01:07:43,000
It's like squirrely work.
It's like this guy has,

1776
01:07:43,030 --> 01:07:45,640
he's gone.
He's made a conclusion in his mind

1777
01:07:45,641 --> 01:07:49,060
already.
And what he's doing in his work is not

1778
01:07:49,061 --> 01:07:52,360
like he's not exploring all the
possibilities.

1779
01:07:52,361 --> 01:07:54,790
He's kind of like pushing towards this
conclusion.

1780
01:07:55,180 --> 01:07:57,100
And the,
the latest one that I'm reading is like,

1781
01:07:57,101 --> 01:08:01,030
it's so sloppy cause he's telling all
these stories about all these people and

1782
01:08:01,031 --> 01:08:03,280
all the,
there are depictions of their

1783
01:08:03,281 --> 01:08:05,560
experiences.
How about you tell me how crazy that

1784
01:08:05,561 --> 01:08:08,200
person isn't a one to 10 tell me,
ask me what do they,

1785
01:08:08,230 --> 01:08:11,800
what do they think about astrology?
What do they think about Tarot cards?

1786
01:08:11,890 --> 01:08:13,540
You know,
what do they think about crystals or

1787
01:08:13,541 --> 01:08:15,410
mind reading?
What do they think about the loch ness

1788
01:08:15,411 --> 01:08:16,070
monster?

1789
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:18,020
I want to know a lot of other shit about
these people.

1790
01:08:18,021 --> 01:08:20,720
I don't want to know about what their
experience was like.

1791
01:08:20,721 --> 01:08:22,190
You know,
first when I was eight,

1792
01:08:22,370 --> 01:08:23,570
you know,
it was alone in a cabin.

1793
01:08:23,571 --> 01:08:26,090
I knew something was there with me.
I saw the dark eyes in the corner of the

1794
01:08:26,091 --> 01:08:29,510
room really were yon lithium.
We you crazy.

1795
01:08:29,511 --> 01:08:31,760
Are you crazy at all?
Was anyone else in your family crazy?

1796
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:34,790
Because there's a lot of crazy
motherfuckers out there and they tell

1797
01:08:34,791 --> 01:08:39,791
some crazy stories and all you need to
know about this whole Ufo abduction

1798
01:08:39,891 --> 01:08:43,550
experience.
The one most important point is that it

1799
01:08:43,551 --> 01:08:45,680
all happens at night.
Well,

1800
01:08:45,750 --> 01:08:49,820
when the fuck are you dreaming?
When the fuck do you have the most

1801
01:08:49,910 --> 01:08:52,100
realistic,
bizarre dreams?

1802
01:08:52,250 --> 01:08:54,920
The other night I had some crazy fucking
dream.

1803
01:08:54,921 --> 01:08:58,670
I was on a dragon.
I was reading from these scrolls that

1804
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:01,430
the words would light up on fire as you
read them.

1805
01:09:01,430 --> 01:09:02,970
So you could only read it once.
I mean,

1806
01:09:03,070 --> 01:09:04,370
this is bizarre.
Yes,

1807
01:09:04,371 --> 01:09:06,950
cool ass dream,
but it was a fucking dream.

1808
01:09:06,951 --> 01:09:09,140
All right.
It was really obvious to me what I woke

1809
01:09:09,141 --> 01:09:09,920
up like,
wow,

1810
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:11,720
what a crazy ass dream.
Well,

1811
01:09:11,750 --> 01:09:13,340
what?
What is a dream?

1812
01:09:13,850 --> 01:09:17,060
What a dream is.
As your mind reaches a certain state in

1813
01:09:17,061 --> 01:09:21,980
rem sleep or rapid eye movement takes
place and all sorts of crazy chemicals,

1814
01:09:21,981 --> 01:09:25,790
psychedelic chemicals start being
produced by your body and they all pass

1815
01:09:25,791 --> 01:09:29,930
the blood brain barrier and you have all
these nutty fucking experiences and you

1816
01:09:29,931 --> 01:09:32,630
and your cousin Mikey,
and you're on sleds and you're running

1817
01:09:32,631 --> 01:09:33,530
from God,
Zillow.

1818
01:09:33,531 --> 01:09:35,660
Like what is that?
Is that real sleds?

1819
01:09:35,780 --> 01:09:39,640
Should we investigate whether there's
sleds in space and whether Godzilla is

1820
01:09:39,641 --> 01:09:40,390
real?
No,

1821
01:09:40,390 --> 01:09:40,810
no,
no.

1822
01:09:40,810 --> 01:09:42,620
You should say,
when did this happen?

1823
01:09:42,710 --> 01:09:43,670
Oh,
I was sleeping.

1824
01:09:43,850 --> 01:09:45,110
Oh,
you were dreaming,

1825
01:09:45,111 --> 01:09:45,590
right?

1826
01:09:45,590 --> 01:09:46,790
Yeah,
probably.

1827
01:09:46,970 --> 01:09:49,790
When were you abducted by aliens?
While I was in bed.

1828
01:09:49,940 --> 01:09:52,010
Do you think you were dreaming?
No,

1829
01:09:52,011 --> 01:09:53,630
it was so real.
Oh,

1830
01:09:53,660 --> 01:09:56,060
okay.
Let's write a book on how real it was.

1831
01:09:56,450 --> 01:10:00,180
And you gotta you gotta say no go real
well.

1832
01:10:00,270 --> 01:10:01,220
A lot of them,
the,

1833
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:03,390
the interviews that they do with them
are so telling they're,

1834
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:06,830
they're really fascinating and not
necessarily that the people are stupid

1835
01:10:07,010 --> 01:10:09,380
and it's not,
and not even necessarily that they're,

1836
01:10:09,530 --> 01:10:10,670
they're,
they're lying.

1837
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:12,650
Cause a lot of them,
I don't think our line,

1838
01:10:12,890 --> 01:10:15,260
I think what a lot of them are is first
of all,

1839
01:10:15,261 --> 01:10:18,770
people live some boring ass fucking
shitty lives.

1840
01:10:19,130 --> 01:10:22,220
They're boring as fuck and if something
happens and all of a sudden that's

1841
01:10:22,221 --> 01:10:24,950
something gives your life meaning like,
oh my God,

1842
01:10:24,970 --> 01:10:28,750
it instead of it being some sleep
paralysis thing where your,

1843
01:10:28,870 --> 01:10:33,350
your brain has his indogenous dump of
psychedelic chemicals that are natural

1844
01:10:33,380 --> 01:10:34,790
in the,
in the brain anyway,

1845
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,430
instead of that being the case like,
no,

1846
01:10:37,431 --> 01:10:38,030
no,
no,

1847
01:10:38,030 --> 01:10:41,660
I've been visited and I have information
that I have to give to the people of the

1848
01:10:41,661 --> 01:10:42,320
world.

1849
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:42,711
Well,
you know,

1850
01:10:42,711 --> 01:10:46,040
if you have a natural psychedelic
experience or if you have a real

1851
01:10:46,041 --> 01:10:49,190
psychedelic experience where you take a
drug and you know you're planning it out

1852
01:10:49,191 --> 01:10:53,120
and either one is going to give you a
very similar experience and that

1853
01:10:53,121 --> 01:10:55,490
experience is what you're doing is
totally wrong.

1854
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:57,920
Everybody's fucked up.
You need to get your shit together.

1855
01:10:58,010 --> 01:11:01,610
How about an analysis of yourself and
analysis of life on the planet and let's

1856
01:11:01,611 --> 01:11:03,260
look at this.
Other than the way we're looking at it

1857
01:11:03,261 --> 01:11:04,790
right now because this obviously isn't
working.

1858
01:11:05,020 --> 01:11:07,950
This is the theme to every mushroom trip
to theme,

1859
01:11:07,951 --> 01:11:10,880
to every acid trip to theme to every
time you eat a pot Brownie,

1860
01:11:10,881 --> 01:11:14,010
you want to reconstruct the whole thing
and put it back together in a way that's

1861
01:11:14,011 --> 01:11:15,780
rational and that makes sense.
You know,

1862
01:11:15,781 --> 01:11:17,140
and this,
this,

1863
01:11:17,220 --> 01:11:18,960
this,
this experience of these people are

1864
01:11:18,961 --> 01:11:19,531
having,
when they're,

1865
01:11:19,531 --> 01:11:22,020
the aliens are telling them,
well we need to get your shit together.

1866
01:11:22,020 --> 01:11:22,431
Yeah,
yeah,

1867
01:11:22,431 --> 01:11:23,160
yeah,
yeah,

1868
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:24,180
yeah.
You're high dude.

1869
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:25,131
You're high.
You're at,

1870
01:11:25,131 --> 01:11:26,790
you're tripping.
You're seeing things in a closet.

1871
01:11:27,150 --> 01:11:28,590
It's that simple.
There's no evidence,

1872
01:11:28,591 --> 01:11:29,520
man.
There's no,

1873
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:31,920
all these people that are tall.
I've got a nick on my shin.

1874
01:11:31,921 --> 01:11:32,970
Look,
this is where they pulled out the

1875
01:11:32,971 --> 01:11:34,470
implant.
Get the fuck Outta here.

1876
01:11:34,471 --> 01:11:36,450
Crazy.
Do you really think that aliens are

1877
01:11:36,451 --> 01:11:38,790
going to leave like little scars on you
and going to be pulling you,

1878
01:11:38,791 --> 01:11:41,400
pinched yourself,
you crazy fuck you pinch yourself and

1879
01:11:41,401 --> 01:11:44,580
made your own scar.
You Daddy Bitch to mention that there's

1880
01:11:44,581 --> 01:11:49,010
so much technology now that that people
probably do kind of like prank.

1881
01:11:49,011 --> 01:11:49,860
He Shit,
you know,

1882
01:11:49,861 --> 01:11:51,930
like I got these like helicopters that
looked like,

1883
01:11:52,040 --> 01:11:55,140
you know,
that you control helicopters and stuff

1884
01:11:55,141 --> 01:11:59,900
like that and well there's also
government stuff that guy in um,

1885
01:12:00,270 --> 01:12:01,890
Philadelphia the other day.
Thank you.

1886
01:12:01,891 --> 01:12:02,700
Whoever you are.

1887
01:12:02,700 --> 01:12:07,650
Some guy came to the show and handed me
a handed the manager a book and the book

1888
01:12:07,651 --> 01:12:12,480
got to me and it's all patents on
Aircrafts that the government has like

1889
01:12:12,510 --> 01:12:15,270
us patents for experimental aircraft.
Oh,

1890
01:12:15,271 --> 01:12:17,280
very cool.
It's fucking nuts man.

1891
01:12:17,310 --> 01:12:22,000
There's this crazy looking cling on look
in ships and Ufo looking things.

1892
01:12:22,950 --> 01:12:24,210
It's not,
it's not a book.

1893
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:25,410
He just put it together.
Yeah,

1894
01:12:25,411 --> 01:12:27,120
he put it together.
It was pretty dope.

1895
01:12:27,150 --> 01:12:28,110
That's pretty sweet.
Yeah.

1896
01:12:28,290 --> 01:12:29,160
And so,
you know,

1897
01:12:29,161 --> 01:12:33,270
I mean you just look at the things that
the government has and has admitted to

1898
01:12:33,271 --> 01:12:37,560
designing and creating.
I mean this is like a fucking a giant

1899
01:12:37,561 --> 01:12:39,810
amount of a man.
When we were doing fear factor,

1900
01:12:39,811 --> 01:12:42,840
we were out at Edwards Air Force Base
near Edwards Air Force Base.

1901
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:45,300
I think it was Edwards.
It's out like near um,

1902
01:12:45,330 --> 01:12:48,090
we were in Palmdale,
whatever the air force bases out there.

1903
01:12:48,090 --> 01:12:50,090
It's a big one.
And um,

1904
01:12:50,220 --> 01:12:54,160
I think it's Edwards and they were
flying stealth bombers and dude,

1905
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:57,180
that is some crazy shit.
This was the beginning of the Iraq war.

1906
01:12:57,181 --> 01:13:00,180
It's like 2002 and they fly those things
overhead,

1907
01:13:00,181 --> 01:13:01,350
dude.
You swear to God,

1908
01:13:01,351 --> 01:13:03,120
you swear to God,
you're in star wars man.

1909
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:04,111
You swear to God.
You're like,

1910
01:13:04,111 --> 01:13:06,450
that is,
that is some shit from the desktop.

1911
01:13:06,630 --> 01:13:10,050
When you watch something fly overhead,
they don't make much noise and they look

1912
01:13:10,051 --> 01:13:12,480
like fucking alien.
Spacecrafts it's dope.

1913
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:15,030
I have you look at them like Danny's a
fucking stealth bomber.

1914
01:13:15,090 --> 01:13:17,070
You can't see that thing with radar,
man.

1915
01:13:17,410 --> 01:13:19,500
That's,
that's something designed to sneak up on

1916
01:13:19,501 --> 01:13:22,890
you and fuck you from the sky and you
can't even see it common.

1917
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:25,920
And it's black like the sky.
So like you look up,

1918
01:13:25,921 --> 01:13:27,570
you see just blackness and it's black
too.

1919
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:29,430
You're fucked.
You're fucked.

1920
01:13:30,290 --> 01:13:31,920
Shit's bad ass.
Yeah,

1921
01:13:31,921 --> 01:13:32,520
it's,
you know,

1922
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:35,430
it's all who designed for killing a few.
Who Do you want on the podcasts in the

1923
01:13:35,431 --> 01:13:37,320
future?
What is your dream people to get on?

1924
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:39,850
I know,
isn't Adam Carolla coming and I'm coming

1925
01:13:39,990 --> 01:13:43,140
next week.
He's going to be here on the 26th.

1926
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:45,690
Adam Cro will be there so that it what
is out of seven days from today.

1927
01:13:45,790 --> 01:13:46,623
So I'm like,
yeah,

1928
01:13:46,900 --> 01:13:47,910
yeah,
yeah.

1929
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:49,590
Adam's going to be on.
And you know what man,

1930
01:13:49,650 --> 01:13:51,900
the,
my dream has already been,

1931
01:13:51,930 --> 01:13:54,150
uh,
not just reached but surpassed.

1932
01:13:54,170 --> 01:13:55,920
I,
when we first started doing this,

1933
01:13:55,921 --> 01:13:57,960
when you and I first started doing this
in episode one,

1934
01:13:57,961 --> 01:14:00,480
we were just fucking around man.
And we're just sitting in front of the

1935
01:14:00,481 --> 01:14:04,290
computer and we just thought it'd be fun
to have like some little kind of silly

1936
01:14:04,291 --> 01:14:06,930
show that we would do for like people
that were on the message board and

1937
01:14:07,010 --> 01:14:07,920
that's mostly what it was.

1938
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:09,780
And people on Twitter,
you know,

1939
01:14:09,810 --> 01:14:13,840
but now it's become like a radio show.
Now it's become this a,

1940
01:14:14,020 --> 01:14:18,190
this a way to tell people about shows
that we never had before.

1941
01:14:18,191 --> 01:14:20,140
You know,
it used to be you would go on a radio

1942
01:14:20,141 --> 01:14:22,940
show and you know,
you would hope that some of the people

1943
01:14:22,941 --> 01:14:25,600
that are listening where your fans or
hope that you could say something funny

1944
01:14:25,601 --> 01:14:27,970
enough to convince them,
you know on the radio in the,

1945
01:14:27,971 --> 01:14:29,710
it's in the morning,
you're fucking half away.

1946
01:14:29,711 --> 01:14:32,710
Give random people listening.
It's random people listening and who

1947
01:14:32,711 --> 01:14:34,510
knows if you're ever going to jive with
the um,

1948
01:14:34,780 --> 01:14:37,150
the Djs,
like there's a radio station in Houston

1949
01:14:37,180 --> 01:14:41,920
that apparently is still mad at me for
being on their radio show back in,

1950
01:14:42,430 --> 01:14:45,670
I guess it was like fear factor days,
like 2002 or 2003.

1951
01:14:45,850 --> 01:14:47,710
And they apparently still talk shit
about me.

1952
01:14:48,190 --> 01:14:51,790
They had me on and I remember they
wanted me and I was probably tired and

1953
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:53,740
if I came off rude,
I didn't mean to,

1954
01:14:53,980 --> 01:14:56,980
but they wanted me to eat some stuff.
The first of all they wanted me to eat

1955
01:14:56,981 --> 01:14:58,390
some big hamburger they had and I'm
like,

1956
01:14:58,391 --> 01:14:59,350
no,
no thank you.

1957
01:14:59,380 --> 01:15:02,590
Like I kind of like,
I watch what I eat and also in the

1958
01:15:02,591 --> 01:15:06,700
morning I have hypothyroidism.
So I take a thyroid medication and when

1959
01:15:06,701 --> 01:15:08,440
I take it,
I can't eat anything for like an hour.

1960
01:15:08,710 --> 01:15:11,110
And so I was on this radio show and
they're trying to get me to eat this

1961
01:15:11,111 --> 01:15:13,180
stupid thing that they made an easy bake
oven.

1962
01:15:13,210 --> 01:15:16,030
I was there.
I actually filmed that digital people

1963
01:15:16,031 --> 01:15:17,770
are mad at me.
Are you still that there's still talk

1964
01:15:17,771 --> 01:15:19,420
shit about me.
Like I'm the worst person they've ever

1965
01:15:19,421 --> 01:15:21,220
had on their show.
And I didn't even know that.

1966
01:15:21,430 --> 01:15:23,710
I didn't even know they had an issue
until I left.

1967
01:15:23,711 --> 01:15:26,500
And apparently they were talking about
me when I wasn't there when I was there.

1968
01:15:26,501 --> 01:15:29,350
They were nice as pie to me.
But then when I left they started

1969
01:15:29,351 --> 01:15:31,000
talking like what?
The guy was so rude.

1970
01:15:31,420 --> 01:15:35,740
They had a gag and I wasn't into their
gag and I didn't know it was stupid

1971
01:15:35,741 --> 01:15:36,970
shit.
This is stupid.

1972
01:15:36,971 --> 01:15:38,380
And you know what?
They're not comedians,

1973
01:15:38,381 --> 01:15:39,070
man.
And they're,

1974
01:15:39,070 --> 01:15:42,430
maybe they're not on my,
my vibe [inaudible] on my frequency.

1975
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:44,910
They're on their own frequency and they
thought it'd be fun.

1976
01:15:44,930 --> 01:15:46,150
They thought it'd be cool if I played
along,

1977
01:15:46,151 --> 01:15:48,130
but I didn't want to eat their thing and
they didn't adjust.

1978
01:15:48,340 --> 01:15:49,570
They didn't adjust.
So then I'm like,

1979
01:15:49,571 --> 01:15:51,340
why the fuck am I doing this?
And then it's like,

1980
01:15:51,590 --> 01:15:52,121
look,
when you,

1981
01:15:52,121 --> 01:15:54,430
when you do radio stations,
there's a lot of different kinds of

1982
01:15:54,431 --> 01:15:55,180
radio DJ's.

1983
01:15:55,180 --> 01:15:59,380
Some of them are really cool and easy to
do and easy to do their shows and other

1984
01:15:59,381 --> 01:16:02,020
ones,
they want more attention than you and

1985
01:16:02,021 --> 01:16:04,450
they're a little squirrely and they
don't like the fact that you're on TV

1986
01:16:04,451 --> 01:16:06,220
and they're on the radio and they get to
be cunty.

1987
01:16:06,430 --> 01:16:07,870
You know,
they get to be weird and they're looking

1988
01:16:07,871 --> 01:16:09,490
for something to be wrong with you.
So you're,

1989
01:16:09,491 --> 01:16:11,800
if you're coming from some fucking
television show and you won't eat their

1990
01:16:11,801 --> 01:16:14,920
stupid easy bake oven thing,
you become an asshole instead of,

1991
01:16:15,010 --> 01:16:16,810
if that was me and I had a guest on
like,

1992
01:16:16,811 --> 01:16:17,261
come on,
easy,

1993
01:16:17,261 --> 01:16:18,780
easy bake oven and he won't do it.
Oh,

1994
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:21,100
I'd be like,
why don't what kind of an idiot am I

1995
01:16:21,460 --> 01:16:23,560
getting this gotta eat something.
This is all I have planned for this

1996
01:16:23,561 --> 01:16:25,420
fucking thing.
I can be asking him a million

1997
01:16:25,421 --> 01:16:28,210
interesting questions like we be talking
about all kinds of crazy stuff,

1998
01:16:28,330 --> 01:16:31,720
but instead I'm pissed that he won't eat
my fucking tuna casserole out of a

1999
01:16:31,721 --> 01:16:32,950
fucking easy bake oven.

2000
01:16:33,340 --> 01:16:35,140
So these people apparently are still
upset at me.

2001
01:16:35,590 --> 01:16:36,191
Well,
you used to,

2002
01:16:36,191 --> 01:16:38,800
it used to have to deal with those kinds
of people in the past.

2003
01:16:38,801 --> 01:16:40,510
Now I don't have,
that doesn't mean anything anymore.

2004
01:16:40,630 --> 01:16:44,050
Every show that I do now,
I do nothing for no press.

2005
01:16:44,250 --> 01:16:46,930
I mean I did Preston and Steve.
I called up,

2006
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:47,801
uh,
for Philly,

2007
01:16:47,801 --> 01:16:49,090
but it was after the shows are already
sold out.

2008
01:16:49,091 --> 01:16:50,770
But I did it because I like them because
they're cool guys.

2009
01:16:51,220 --> 01:16:54,550
But like when we do these shows,
now we have our own radio station.

2010
01:16:54,551 --> 01:16:57,910
We have our own,
our own ability to promote the shows.

2011
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:01,600
Probably more listeners than ever then
compared to that radio station that

2012
01:17:01,601 --> 01:17:02,530
hates you.
Yeah,

2013
01:17:02,890 --> 01:17:05,950
well that,
and it's all 100% your fans,

2014
01:17:06,010 --> 01:17:07,390
those are,
I hate that word.

2015
01:17:07,630 --> 01:17:09,620
Oh,
100% people who your work,

2016
01:17:09,621 --> 01:17:11,870
right?
So they already are enjoying what you

2017
01:17:11,871 --> 01:17:12,110
do.

2018
01:17:12,110 --> 01:17:13,910
They already enjoy your podcasts.
They,

2019
01:17:13,930 --> 01:17:15,380
they're already there for you.
They like you,

2020
01:17:15,470 --> 01:17:18,180
you know,
and so they want to come to the shows as

2021
01:17:18,250 --> 01:17:19,011
opposed to,
you know,

2022
01:17:19,011 --> 01:17:22,010
doing a radio show and trying to get
people out there to listen and like you.

2023
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:25,460
And that's why people like those people,
these mediocre folks in Houston,

2024
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:26,410
that's why they,
they,

2025
01:17:26,410 --> 01:17:28,140
you know,
they have like this,

2026
01:17:28,250 --> 01:17:31,070
that's why they have power.
They're their only power was that

2027
01:17:31,071 --> 01:17:33,740
they're the ones who get to talk on this
radio show when you mind would it,

2028
01:17:33,741 --> 01:17:34,970
they're not even,
they have no talent.

2029
01:17:34,971 --> 01:17:36,920
There's nothing going on there.
They're just talking people.

2030
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:40,070
They're just dumb dumbs that are,
and then they play music.

2031
01:17:40,220 --> 01:17:42,770
They sorta hijack your attention span
for a few minutes while you wait for the

2032
01:17:42,771 --> 01:17:44,840
next cool song to start planning.
And they're just sitting there and

2033
01:17:44,841 --> 01:17:46,410
reading your Wikipedia page most of the
times,

2034
01:17:46,411 --> 01:17:50,060
if it's still Joe Rogan,
I heard that to be a problem for me.

2035
01:17:50,060 --> 01:17:51,290
It's just don't,
you know,

2036
01:17:51,291 --> 01:17:52,910
I just,
I don't know why they're still upset at

2037
01:17:52,911 --> 01:17:55,040
me because apparently this is some
recent interview.

2038
01:17:55,260 --> 01:17:56,920
Oh really?
I didn't even know about,

2039
01:17:56,990 --> 01:17:58,820
I don't even know who they are.
I don't even know where the station is.

2040
01:17:59,450 --> 01:18:01,130
I don't care if it's there.
Look,

2041
01:18:01,131 --> 01:18:03,590
if it's all these years and you're still
upset that I wouldn't eat your thing

2042
01:18:03,591 --> 01:18:04,970
that's on you.
That's on you.

2043
01:18:04,971 --> 01:18:07,400
100% I didn't do anything to,
I didn't break your window.

2044
01:18:07,420 --> 01:18:09,080
Didn't like your bathroom on fire,
you know?

2045
01:18:09,081 --> 01:18:11,150
If I just didn't eat your thing,
that's on you.

2046
01:18:11,690 --> 01:18:13,850
It's,
the whole world is filled with different

2047
01:18:13,851 --> 01:18:14,571
kinds of people,
men,

2048
01:18:14,571 --> 01:18:18,200
and if you try to make everybody happy,
you will fucking go crazy.

2049
01:18:18,410 --> 01:18:20,930
I know when I've been a douchebag and my
past,

2050
01:18:21,290 --> 01:18:25,190
I know when I've done things where I
could have made this go smoother,

2051
01:18:25,191 --> 01:18:27,200
I could have just,
this wasn't one of those things.

2052
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:30,740
This is just stupidity and I didn't want
to deal with stupidity.

2053
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:34,340
You're going to Texas soon,
aren't you?

2054
01:18:34,730 --> 01:18:36,820
Like August or something like that?
I want to go back to,

2055
01:18:36,900 --> 01:18:37,910
yeah,
I'm going to Houston.

2056
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:39,590
I think August,
August.

2057
01:18:39,780 --> 01:18:40,970
I can't wait.
That'll be fun.

2058
01:18:41,060 --> 01:18:42,710
Yeah,
I'm doing that September again in the

2059
01:18:42,711 --> 01:18:43,940
Austin too.
Oh really?

2060
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,290
Yeah.
That's always a good time.

2061
01:18:45,910 --> 01:18:47,540
And plus now,
um,

2062
01:18:47,630 --> 01:18:49,760
it looks like I'm recording the special
in June.

2063
01:18:49,820 --> 01:18:50,500
So,
uh,

2064
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:53,210
if that happens then um,
I'll have,

2065
01:18:53,250 --> 01:18:55,580
uh,
I'll have to have all new shit by the

2066
01:18:55,581 --> 01:18:58,370
time September rolls around.
So I've got a lot of work to do.

2067
01:18:58,570 --> 01:18:59,990
Right.
That's exciting man.

2068
01:19:00,410 --> 01:19:02,930
I've been writing a lot lately man,
cause I'm trying to finish this book.

2069
01:19:03,140 --> 01:19:06,800
I've been writing like crazy man writing
is so fucking satisfying.

2070
01:19:06,801 --> 01:19:08,630
It might be one of my favorite things to
do.

2071
01:19:09,020 --> 01:19:14,020
I love the idea that you just sit in
front of that computer and these ideas

2072
01:19:14,271 --> 01:19:15,530
just start dancing in your head.

2073
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:16,710
There's Ted dancing,
you know,

2074
01:19:16,750 --> 01:19:21,070
they start arranging themselves on paper
and then sometimes like when a,

2075
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:23,120
when an idea will come out and then
another idea,

2076
01:19:23,121 --> 01:19:25,400
we'll follow it and I'll like a step
back,

2077
01:19:25,940 --> 01:19:27,560
a step back and look and I'm like,
wow,

2078
01:19:27,820 --> 01:19:30,860
it's this crazy thing that just like
happened through me.

2079
01:19:31,010 --> 01:19:32,820
You know,
this crazy idea that you know,

2080
01:19:32,900 --> 01:19:36,730
just happened through me.
And then it all like puts itself onto

2081
01:19:36,770 --> 01:19:39,050
paper and then the next thing you know
there's a hundred pages and actually,

2082
01:19:39,051 --> 01:19:40,040
you know,
there's 200 pages.

2083
01:19:40,041 --> 01:19:41,390
It's like wow,
it's,

2084
01:19:41,420 --> 01:19:43,610
it's,
it's such a fascinating process,

2085
01:19:43,611 --> 01:19:46,010
man.
The creative process of actually sitting

2086
01:19:46,011 --> 01:19:48,350
down and writing.
It's amazing,

2087
01:19:48,351 --> 01:19:49,430
man.
I tried last night,

2088
01:19:49,431 --> 01:19:52,190
I was going to write just for like an
hour and then get in the tank.

2089
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:55,220
But once,
sometimes every now and then you tap

2090
01:19:55,221 --> 01:19:57,140
into a vein and you've got to stay
there.

2091
01:19:57,170 --> 01:19:58,520
You can't go anywhere,
you know?

2092
01:19:58,521 --> 01:20:02,270
And I just had one idea that I needed to
write down before I went into the tank.

2093
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:05,390
And as I was writing that idea down,
something about writing,

2094
01:20:05,391 --> 01:20:07,130
like say if you're thinking about a
word,

2095
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:09,330
like if you're writing the word
experience,

2096
01:20:09,910 --> 01:20:12,720
it takes longer to write that word than
it is to think of the concept of

2097
01:20:12,721 --> 01:20:15,450
experience.
So it allows you to deeply consider

2098
01:20:15,451 --> 01:20:18,210
everything that you're saying.
And then oftentimes like when you're

2099
01:20:18,211 --> 01:20:21,060
writing,
I can seem so much smarter writing than

2100
01:20:21,061 --> 01:20:22,410
I ever could.
Just talking.

2101
01:20:22,590 --> 01:20:23,610
You think?
Yeah.

2102
01:20:23,710 --> 01:20:24,570
Yeah.
You definitely,

2103
01:20:24,730 --> 01:20:27,880
I mean you talk very like smart.

2104
01:20:27,970 --> 01:20:28,970
Yeah.
But I'm wasted.

2105
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:31,990
I,
but I'm way smarter writing that I am

2106
01:20:31,991 --> 01:20:36,190
talking cause you can consider
everything much more.

2107
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:37,960
You know,
you get a chance to look at it.

2108
01:20:38,170 --> 01:20:38,941
You know,
you,

2109
01:20:38,941 --> 01:20:41,080
you really get to know someone.
Like,

2110
01:20:41,081 --> 01:20:42,910
and that's another beautiful thing about
this podcast.

2111
01:20:42,940 --> 01:20:46,600
You get to know someone when you're
talking to them for a long time.

2112
01:20:46,601 --> 01:20:48,430
You get to know like how their brain
works.

2113
01:20:48,790 --> 01:20:50,320
You know like you could write things
out.

2114
01:20:50,321 --> 01:20:53,470
Like that's what that was used to drive
me crazy about presidential speeches and

2115
01:20:53,471 --> 01:20:55,750
shit like that.
That they have people writing them for

2116
01:20:55,751 --> 01:20:57,550
them.
That is so fucked up.

2117
01:20:57,910 --> 01:20:59,000
It's his time.
Right.

2118
01:20:59,300 --> 01:21:02,390
Cause they have to give it like a speech
like every fucking day almost.

2119
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:05,120
Can you just speak from the heart?
Yeah.

2120
01:21:05,121 --> 01:21:06,290
But,
but there's probably things they have to

2121
01:21:06,291 --> 01:21:08,360
just touch on their property.
Not like writers.

2122
01:21:08,361 --> 01:21:11,270
Like this is what you have to say.
It's more of like taking your ideas and

2123
01:21:11,271 --> 01:21:12,660
making an his speech for him.
Cause I,

2124
01:21:12,661 --> 01:21:16,280
I mean they literally have to do like
probably two or three speeches a day.

2125
01:21:16,310 --> 01:21:19,320
If you looked at Obama's like really?
Does he do two or three of them?

2126
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:22,280
They're always going to,
colleges are talking here with

2127
01:21:22,281 --> 01:21:23,480
representatives,
you know,

2128
01:21:23,510 --> 01:21:25,910
they're always doing speeches.
If you looked at his schedule,

2129
01:21:25,911 --> 01:21:28,880
like there's that one time where they
followed him around for a week or I

2130
01:21:28,881 --> 01:21:31,820
forget what program did it and it was
just like his schedule is pretty much

2131
01:21:31,821 --> 01:21:33,010
from when you wake up,
uh,

2132
01:21:33,320 --> 01:21:35,360
just going from one place to another,
giving a speech,

2133
01:21:35,450 --> 01:21:36,860
giving a speech,
giving a speech.

2134
01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:40,370
Oh right.
Your own speech speeches,

2135
01:21:40,371 --> 01:21:42,530
bitch.
I think he does actually.

2136
01:21:42,531 --> 01:21:45,430
And one of his most famous speeches is
one that he wrote,

2137
01:21:45,740 --> 01:21:48,650
one of them,
the ones when he was running for office.

2138
01:21:48,890 --> 01:21:51,710
He's,
he's a smart guy and he's a very good

2139
01:21:51,711 --> 01:21:55,610
speech writer.
But the whole idea of having a speech

2140
01:21:55,611 --> 01:21:59,360
written out for you by a bunch of other
people's kind of offensive to me it's

2141
01:21:59,361 --> 01:22:00,440
like,
what the fuck are you doing?

2142
01:22:00,441 --> 01:22:02,300
Being the leader.
If you've got all these people telling

2143
01:22:02,301 --> 01:22:05,330
you exactly what to say and you know
you're following all these charts and

2144
01:22:05,331 --> 01:22:08,420
graphs and this is what the people want,
and so let's give them this and this is

2145
01:22:08,421 --> 01:22:10,940
sort of in the middle and we'll lower
the expectations,

2146
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,710
expectations with that,
and then they'll hit them.

2147
01:22:12,740 --> 01:22:14,090
We'll hit them with this to make them
happy.

2148
01:22:14,540 --> 01:22:16,640
It's just,
it's like so obvious that were being

2149
01:22:16,641 --> 01:22:17,800
played,
you know?

2150
01:22:17,810 --> 01:22:19,850
That's what drives me nuts about speech,
writing,

2151
01:22:19,851 --> 01:22:21,320
about the idea of it.
So this was like,

2152
01:22:21,620 --> 01:22:23,660
they're not even trying to pretend that
they're not playing.

2153
01:22:23,661 --> 01:22:26,300
You didn't even try to pretend that this
guy wrote the shit himself.

2154
01:22:26,770 --> 01:22:28,640
You know,
he's just up there reading off a fucking

2155
01:22:28,641 --> 01:22:32,630
teleprompter and you're just going you
and nothing changes.

2156
01:22:32,860 --> 01:22:34,570
Yeah.
I couldn't never do that.

2157
01:22:34,571 --> 01:22:36,550
I could never do speeches or anything
like that.

2158
01:22:37,010 --> 01:22:38,990
You could,
if you wanted to give speeches on

2159
01:22:38,991 --> 01:22:42,140
podcasting or speeches on something that
you know a lot about,

2160
01:22:42,141 --> 01:22:44,810
like if you want to give speeches on how
to be a good video editor,

2161
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:47,060
you could do that.
You could easily do like a seminar in

2162
01:22:47,061 --> 01:22:47,990
video editing.
You know,

2163
01:22:47,991 --> 01:22:51,050
if you ever wanted to like if people
like we're anti your internet videos and

2164
01:22:51,051 --> 01:22:54,410
you could come up with a bunch of bolts
and points of things that you need to

2165
01:22:54,411 --> 01:22:55,041
consider.
Like,

2166
01:22:55,041 --> 01:22:55,970
Hey,
brevity,

2167
01:22:55,971 --> 01:22:56,570
you know,
there's,

2168
01:22:56,570 --> 01:22:58,670
you want to make it under 10 minutes.
You want this,

2169
01:22:58,671 --> 01:22:59,840
you want that,
you know,

2170
01:22:59,841 --> 01:23:03,650
this is my best video and this is why.
And the good thing about this video is

2171
01:23:03,651 --> 01:23:06,250
it starts off in one point,
then it goes back in time,

2172
01:23:06,250 --> 01:23:08,200
then it brings you forward again.
You know,

2173
01:23:08,460 --> 01:23:09,580
and then you can,
you could,

2174
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:11,320
you know,
you could easily do something like that.

2175
01:23:11,350 --> 01:23:12,520
Anything that you're in too,
man,

2176
01:23:12,550 --> 01:23:13,900
you could teach other people how to do
it.

2177
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:18,960
Did you hear that flip video is no more
what Cisco bought flipped video and they

2178
01:23:19,300 --> 01:23:20,770
asked him,
they killed it.

2179
01:23:21,130 --> 01:23:24,520
I always thought for some reason flipped
video was very successful and a big

2180
01:23:24,550 --> 01:23:26,670
moneymaker.
Seems like everybody's got flip videos.

2181
01:23:26,671 --> 01:23:29,260
See a lot of them had it.
And when Norton was at,

2182
01:23:29,261 --> 01:23:30,250
uh,
Austin,

2183
01:23:30,251 --> 01:23:31,600
he taped all this.
That's what that shit,

2184
01:23:31,630 --> 01:23:33,040
yeah,
they killed it for some reason.

2185
01:23:33,550 --> 01:23:35,200
Is it?
What is it so good?

2186
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:36,580
Is it a big deal?
Well,

2187
01:23:36,581 --> 01:23:38,640
I mean it's,
it's just kind of weird that,

2188
01:23:38,641 --> 01:23:39,610
that,
that they did that,

2189
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:41,740
you know,
you would have never found out about

2190
01:23:41,741 --> 01:23:43,090
that 20 years ago.
Yeah.

2191
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:43,953
It would just,
it would,

2192
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:47,050
unless you were reading the technology
page of the New York Times,

2193
01:23:47,051 --> 01:23:48,670
you know,
how the fuck would you have ever known?

2194
01:23:48,970 --> 01:23:51,330
You know,
now you get like an email alert from CNN

2195
01:23:51,340 --> 01:23:54,000
to tell you that flip video has been
eaten up by Cisco.

2196
01:23:54,060 --> 01:23:54,970
Yeah.
You know?

2197
01:23:55,050 --> 01:23:57,970
Yeah.
You know who Scott Adams is the guy who

2198
01:23:57,971 --> 01:23:59,200
created Dilbert.
Uh Huh.

2199
01:23:59,950 --> 01:24:04,480
He got busted going online defending
himself under a fake name.

2200
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:05,650
Or You sir?
Yeah,

2201
01:24:05,780 --> 01:24:08,620
I sound like the week of shit ever.
How did he get busted?

2202
01:24:08,621 --> 01:24:08,910
I don't know.

2203
01:24:08,910 --> 01:24:10,860
No,
he got busted and then he,

2204
01:24:10,861 --> 01:24:14,850
um,
he like wrote something about it,

2205
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:18,150
admitting it and uh,
it's,

2206
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:22,500
this is what he wrote a according to
wise and fair Denisons of the Internet.

2207
01:24:22,501 --> 01:24:26,520
This after he's been busted according to
the wise and fair denizens of the

2208
01:24:26,521 --> 01:24:29,070
Internet,
this behavior is proved that I am a thin

2209
01:24:29,071 --> 01:24:33,960
skin troll asshole Dick fame whore
egomaniac Douche nozzle,

2210
01:24:34,050 --> 01:24:37,050
misogynist.
That list might sound bad to you,

2211
01:24:37,140 --> 01:24:39,630
but keep in mind that I was starting
from a pretty low base.

2212
01:24:39,660 --> 01:24:43,530
So I think my reputation is trending up.
That's pretty funny.

2213
01:24:43,650 --> 01:24:45,000
Wow.
Yeah,

2214
01:24:45,510 --> 01:24:47,820
it's in the Osi weekly if you guys want
to read it.

2215
01:24:47,821 --> 01:24:50,000
It's kind of interesting cause they're,
you know,

2216
01:24:50,040 --> 01:24:50,821
they're like,
wow,

2217
01:24:50,821 --> 01:24:53,970
this is what he did.
Was he logged online.

2218
01:24:54,360 --> 01:24:56,010
Um,
and he,

2219
01:24:56,070 --> 01:25:00,570
he did a under the name planned chaos
and he pretended to be the only person

2220
01:25:00,571 --> 01:25:05,571
in the world who doesn't hate him
because I guess he's been getting in

2221
01:25:05,821 --> 01:25:06,654
trouble lately.

2222
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:09,480
I don't remember what it was.
I don't,

2223
01:25:09,481 --> 01:25:11,570
I don't remember what exactly he said.
He's,

2224
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:16,350
he said some things that people thought
were a questionable and so,

2225
01:25:16,351 --> 01:25:17,790
uh,
people were shitting all over him.

2226
01:25:17,940 --> 01:25:19,430
I met him.
He was on a,

2227
01:25:19,431 --> 01:25:21,830
an episode of News Radio.
Yeah.

2228
01:25:22,020 --> 01:25:24,350
That goes to show you a how old Tilbert
is Dover.

2229
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:25,590
It's been around forever.
Man,

2230
01:25:25,740 --> 01:25:27,600
I never got into Dilbert.
Wrote was terrible.

2231
01:25:27,720 --> 01:25:30,600
Those,
those cartoons are like the lowest

2232
01:25:30,601 --> 01:25:34,260
expectation ever for humor and for
entertainment value.

2233
01:25:34,710 --> 01:25:36,840
It's amazing that they can make so much
money.

2234
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:39,960
Like I used to read Doonesbury and I
remember Doonesbury this smart one,

2235
01:25:39,961 --> 01:25:41,400
man,
it was really smart.

2236
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:46,520
The only time to me it was even remotely
interesting was when they had a Raul

2237
01:25:47,010 --> 01:25:48,600
Raul Duke.
It was the hunter s Thompson character

2238
01:25:48,770 --> 01:25:50,610
who would come in with guns and start
shooting shit up.

2239
01:25:50,611 --> 01:25:52,800
And you know,
it was like hunters Thompson's,

2240
01:25:52,801 --> 01:25:54,000
um,
uh,

2241
01:25:54,030 --> 01:25:56,190
they kind of like,
he has his character,

2242
01:25:56,191 --> 01:25:58,040
Raul Duke from,
um,

2243
01:25:58,170 --> 01:26:00,000
fear and loathing in Las Vegas.
You know,

2244
01:26:00,270 --> 01:26:03,680
he like the,
not the novel is sort of based very

2245
01:26:03,681 --> 01:26:04,160
loosely

2246
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:06,140
on him and his,
uh,

2247
01:26:06,380 --> 01:26:09,500
his friend Oscar and the crazy shit they
did when they were on drugs and Vegas.

2248
01:26:09,560 --> 01:26:11,060
Right.
And this,

2249
01:26:11,090 --> 01:26:15,770
this guy from Doonesbury just sort of
co-opted that character sort of stole

2250
01:26:15,771 --> 01:26:18,320
it,
stole his intellectual property and

2251
01:26:18,321 --> 01:26:21,290
started using it as characters inside of
his,

2252
01:26:21,291 --> 01:26:22,340
uh,
Doonesbury comic.

2253
01:26:22,640 --> 01:26:24,980
I thought that was kind of cool.
Like those kind of funny that he did

2254
01:26:24,981 --> 01:26:26,360
that it was kind of,
those were fun.

2255
01:26:26,540 --> 01:26:28,790
But other than that,
like most of it was like really like

2256
01:26:28,791 --> 01:26:31,250
nothing.
It's like the jokes were like,

2257
01:26:31,370 --> 01:26:32,630
Ooh,
uh,

2258
01:26:32,631 --> 01:26:34,980
give a read like Marma Duke or something
like that.

2259
01:26:35,540 --> 01:26:38,820
How was that shit still even a possible
your Bailey's still around?

2260
01:26:38,840 --> 01:26:39,673
Yeah,
I think so.

2261
01:26:39,740 --> 01:26:41,510
I think,
I don't know.

2262
01:26:41,780 --> 01:26:44,300
I don't fucking know who would cry if
the cartoons section.

2263
01:26:44,310 --> 01:26:46,820
I remember when I was a kid though,
I used to like the cartoons I used to

2264
01:26:46,821 --> 01:26:49,670
like far side that was fucking brilliant
shit.

2265
01:26:49,730 --> 01:26:50,720
And then they just Kinda,
you know,

2266
01:26:50,721 --> 01:26:53,270
Kinda went away when I was at Garfield
guy growing up,

2267
01:26:53,300 --> 01:26:55,910
obviously.
So Garfield in far side where my to

2268
01:26:56,060 --> 01:26:58,740
Calvin and Hobbes pretty.
So you do like our duties?

2269
01:26:58,820 --> 01:26:59,331
I do.
I mean,

2270
01:26:59,331 --> 01:26:59,970
but,
but,

2271
01:26:59,970 --> 01:27:02,970
but then you get those ones like
whatever that fucking Kathy.

2272
01:27:04,110 --> 01:27:05,690
Oh yeah.
Fucking,

2273
01:27:05,691 --> 01:27:08,600
there's some that don't make any sense
and you have to wonder how those people

2274
01:27:08,601 --> 01:27:11,150
keep their jobs.
Is it like some sort of a government job

2275
01:27:11,151 --> 01:27:14,750
where you can't get fired or that prince
valiant or whatever that one that was

2276
01:27:14,751 --> 01:27:16,160
like,
remember that one?

2277
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:20,660
What was that one where it's like all
medieval knights and I always tried to

2278
01:27:20,661 --> 01:27:23,060
get into that one but I could never
fucking do it.

2279
01:27:23,090 --> 01:27:24,410
Oh,
they're the worst man.

2280
01:27:25,160 --> 01:27:26,120
They're the worst there.
Is there.

2281
01:27:26,121 --> 01:27:30,680
Is there anything worse than fucking
stupid cartoons because there's no lower

2282
01:27:30,681 --> 01:27:31,514
standard.

2283
01:27:32,090 --> 01:27:34,760
You know,
like if you ever like read a cartoon and

2284
01:27:34,761 --> 01:27:39,200
laughed now like Holy Shit,
that's Pharcyde definitely.

2285
01:27:39,230 --> 01:27:39,900
Really?
Yeah,

2286
01:27:39,900 --> 01:27:42,500
first sides.
You never read any of the first.

2287
01:27:42,501 --> 01:27:43,560
I never got into it,
man.

2288
01:27:43,670 --> 01:27:45,950
It's,
I think like standup comics.

2289
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:50,690
Some cartoons are so bad,
they like turn you off to other

2290
01:27:50,691 --> 01:27:52,800
cartoons.
Like I've talked to people that have

2291
01:27:52,820 --> 01:27:54,690
been to like shitty comedy shows like,
man,

2292
01:27:54,691 --> 01:27:56,180
I'm not really in a live comedy,
right?

2293
01:27:56,210 --> 01:27:56,601
Like,
well,

2294
01:27:56,601 --> 01:27:58,190
you're not in a lab company.
Okay,

2295
01:27:58,191 --> 01:28:00,560
what are you talking about?
Have you ever gone to Saint Louis C k?

2296
01:28:00,770 --> 01:28:03,380
Okay,
go see Louis C K and then tell me if

2297
01:28:03,381 --> 01:28:05,870
you're in the lab comedy,
because you might not be into some

2298
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:09,290
Douche bags at the chuckle hut,
you know that are telling nonsense

2299
01:28:09,291 --> 01:28:11,150
jokes,
but go to see Chris Rock.

2300
01:28:11,200 --> 01:28:13,850
Go to see Dave Chappelle.
What does he a real comic.

2301
01:28:14,060 --> 01:28:15,320
You're going to love comedy,
man.

2302
01:28:15,320 --> 01:28:17,750
Don't get crazy.
You go see Joey Diaz and if you don't

2303
01:28:17,751 --> 01:28:19,310
laugh,
you don't have a fucking pulse.

2304
01:28:19,510 --> 01:28:20,540
All right?
There's something wrong with you.

2305
01:28:20,550 --> 01:28:21,920
You're not.
You're not enjoying that.

2306
01:28:23,470 --> 01:28:25,900
Joe.
Joey destroyed all weekend in,

2307
01:28:25,901 --> 01:28:28,220
in Philadelphia.
He's so fun to have around,

2308
01:28:28,221 --> 01:28:30,350
man.
No one makes me laugh more than that

2309
01:28:30,351 --> 01:28:32,750
guy.
He's so fucking fun to have around.

2310
01:28:33,680 --> 01:28:35,390
But as we were saying before,
he gets wired,

2311
01:28:35,980 --> 01:28:39,290
he gets angry at you.
I'm just reading these facts that I,

2312
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:43,280
that were on digg.com today if facts
about masturbation and it's going

2313
01:28:43,281 --> 01:28:45,260
through that,
that male Kangaroos have been known to

2314
01:28:45,261 --> 01:28:47,570
give them stuff,
blow jobs and female porcupines have

2315
01:28:47,571 --> 01:28:49,880
been witnessed using wooden sticks as
deal dose.

2316
01:28:50,450 --> 01:28:52,870
What he imagined wanting to animal
checkoffs.

2317
01:28:52,890 --> 01:28:55,160
Did dinosaurs have Dick's?
Right?

2318
01:28:56,660 --> 01:28:57,231
Right.
Yeah.

2319
01:28:57,231 --> 01:28:59,240
I was thinking,
imagine how big that Dick is and then

2320
01:28:59,241 --> 01:29:02,150
like if a dinosaur fucking calm,
like how much come that would be?

2321
01:29:03,140 --> 01:29:05,520
How are you 12 no,
I was just thinking about it the other

2322
01:29:05,521 --> 01:29:08,130
day when the dinosaur come didn't have
dinosaur decks.

2323
01:29:08,160 --> 01:29:11,520
How big would the load be if a dinosaur
come?

2324
01:29:12,260 --> 01:29:14,370
Yeah,
and here's another fact.

2325
01:29:16,620 --> 01:29:21,620
30% of suicides by males age of 12
through 20 are attributed to our auto

2326
01:29:22,530 --> 01:29:24,870
erotic fiction.
No.

2327
01:29:24,871 --> 01:29:26,400
What is that on Wikipedia,
man,

2328
01:29:26,660 --> 01:29:28,140
I don't know to,
Oh,

2329
01:29:28,141 --> 01:29:32,490
here's a flush [inaudible] 12 to 20
that's silly.

2330
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:33,301
That's insane.
You know,

2331
01:29:33,301 --> 01:29:35,280
here's a fucking interesting statistic.
That's real.

2332
01:29:35,340 --> 01:29:39,060
70% of all pornography gets washed
during nine to five hours.

2333
01:29:39,390 --> 01:29:40,223
Really?
Yep.

2334
01:29:40,770 --> 01:29:45,330
12% of a,
a porno film is watched at a hotel room

2335
01:29:45,390 --> 01:29:46,630
on average.
Only 12.

2336
01:29:46,650 --> 01:29:49,350
That makes sense.
But 70% being,

2337
01:29:49,380 --> 01:29:51,690
uh,
during the internet or downloaded from

2338
01:29:51,691 --> 01:29:53,520
the Internet while you're at work,
nine to five.

2339
01:29:53,550 --> 01:29:55,710
Totally.
How many people are watching this

2340
01:29:55,711 --> 01:29:57,750
podcast or listening to this podcast at
work?

2341
01:29:58,710 --> 01:30:02,760
How many of you were masturbating while
listening to two people right now and

2342
01:30:02,761 --> 01:30:05,010
only one's hard?
One of them was crying,

2343
01:30:05,700 --> 01:30:07,950
struggling,
trying to make shit happen.

2344
01:30:09,210 --> 01:30:12,810
There's too much porn.
I think at this point it's almost like

2345
01:30:12,811 --> 01:30:15,330
it's too easy to beat off,
you know?

2346
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:16,800
It's all,
it's all out there.

2347
01:30:16,990 --> 01:30:17,621
It's,
it's,

2348
01:30:17,621 --> 01:30:21,540
it's almost like unavoidable.
Like you used to be hard as hell to get

2349
01:30:21,541 --> 01:30:23,250
some pornography.
When I was a kid,

2350
01:30:23,251 --> 01:30:25,230
like we were talking about earlier,
like about magazines,

2351
01:30:25,231 --> 01:30:26,940
man,
that was what you got magazines,

2352
01:30:26,941 --> 01:30:28,770
man.
You had to go to a liquor store and ask

2353
01:30:28,771 --> 01:30:30,870
for the back shelf.
And you know,

2354
01:30:30,990 --> 01:30:31,860
nowadays,
man,

2355
01:30:32,130 --> 01:30:35,340
it's so fucking easy to get pornography
nowadays.

2356
01:30:35,370 --> 01:30:39,840
You could just specialize on one
particular type of pornography.

2357
01:30:39,900 --> 01:30:42,120
Yeah,
you could be like a Weirdo foot guy.

2358
01:30:42,121 --> 01:30:45,330
You only want foot jobs,
girls jacking guys off of their feet and

2359
01:30:45,331 --> 01:30:49,030
you could fucking stack monitors to the
top of your room like a,

2360
01:30:49,031 --> 01:30:50,400
like a,
a movie screen,

2361
01:30:50,401 --> 01:30:53,890
50 feet high and every one of them has
got a different video of a girl,

2362
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:55,080
Jurgen,
a guy off with their feet.

2363
01:30:55,350 --> 01:30:57,900
You would die of old age before you
watched all of them.

2364
01:30:58,050 --> 01:31:00,030
There's this,
there's this a shit that I was reading

2365
01:31:00,031 --> 01:31:01,760
about where guys who,
uh,

2366
01:31:01,830 --> 01:31:05,460
go to graveyards after they bury
somebody.

2367
01:31:05,670 --> 01:31:07,200
Um,
like recently,

2368
01:31:07,370 --> 01:31:08,160
like,
like they go,

2369
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:11,100
they would like the next day after they
bury somebody and they'd dig 'em up and

2370
01:31:11,101 --> 01:31:13,410
fuck them.
Oh God.

2371
01:31:13,470 --> 01:31:16,500
Like they check the obituaries and find
like a young team,

2372
01:31:16,530 --> 01:31:17,910
you know.
Oh,

2373
01:31:17,930 --> 01:31:19,180
and where was this happening?
Uh,

2374
01:31:19,230 --> 01:31:20,320
it was on the Internet.
I read it.

2375
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:23,000
Of course people are doing it in the,
there was a,

2376
01:31:23,001 --> 01:31:26,880
an old Kinison bit,
people doing it and a morticians office

2377
01:31:26,900 --> 01:31:28,000
and the mortuary that,
you know,

2378
01:31:28,060 --> 01:31:29,820
remember that bit.
I could see that happening.

2379
01:31:29,821 --> 01:31:31,830
Dude.
That bit is what got me into Kennison

2380
01:31:31,950 --> 01:31:33,240
really.
I've told this story before,

2381
01:31:33,241 --> 01:31:36,660
but in the interest of brevity,
a girl that I was working with did the

2382
01:31:36,661 --> 01:31:40,170
bit for me cause he was telling me how
funny he was and she was lying on her

2383
01:31:40,171 --> 01:31:41,490
stomach in the parking lot on it.

2384
01:31:41,580 --> 01:31:46,570
Oh you mean live keeps fucking you in
the ass even after your dad never ends.

2385
01:31:47,280 --> 01:31:48,720
And I remember thinking like,
wow,

2386
01:31:48,750 --> 01:31:51,120
what does this guy like?
This guy must be the funniest guy ever.

2387
01:31:51,270 --> 01:31:54,390
And then I got ahold of is a HBO special
and I got a chance to see it.

2388
01:31:54,391 --> 01:31:58,950
That's what that was probably the one
moment when I was 19 years old,

2389
01:31:58,951 --> 01:32:00,070
but girl on her stomach

2390
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:02,960
and the parking lot telling me that Joe,
that was one of the,

2391
01:32:02,961 --> 01:32:06,160
the one moments,
one of the few moments in my life were a

2392
01:32:06,161 --> 01:32:08,980
spark went off in my head like wow,
maybe I should do that.

2393
01:32:09,070 --> 01:32:12,430
Maybe I should be a fucking comedian.
You know when I was 19 I had no idea

2394
01:32:12,431 --> 01:32:13,750
what the hell was going to happen in my
future.

2395
01:32:13,751 --> 01:32:14,980
I didn't know what what I was going to
do,

2396
01:32:15,250 --> 01:32:17,290
but I was already starting to think like
maybe,

2397
01:32:17,291 --> 01:32:19,180
you know,
maybe I have to find something.

2398
01:32:19,181 --> 01:32:20,590
You know,
maybe it's not martial arts.

2399
01:32:20,591 --> 01:32:22,030
I have to find like something else to
do.

2400
01:32:22,031 --> 01:32:24,910
Like maybe it was this,
this fucking guy's on his stomach,

2401
01:32:24,940 --> 01:32:26,810
you know,
pretend to get fucked in the ass like,

2402
01:32:26,900 --> 01:32:28,630
but there was nothing like that back
then,

2403
01:32:28,631 --> 01:32:31,660
man.
But I think his joke was based on a true

2404
01:32:31,661 --> 01:32:32,980
story.
It was in la,

2405
01:32:33,010 --> 01:32:37,810
so some people got arrested for paying
the morticians to spend a few hours

2406
01:32:37,811 --> 01:32:40,030
undisturbed with the freshest male
corpses.

2407
01:32:40,140 --> 01:32:41,940
Oh God.
Oh God.

2408
01:32:41,970 --> 01:32:44,400
Yeah.
I think if I was a mortician,

2409
01:32:44,490 --> 01:32:49,260
and I think if you get a hot chick that
there'd be some times you're sitting in

2410
01:32:49,261 --> 01:32:50,520
this basement by yourself,
you'd be like,

2411
01:32:50,521 --> 01:32:52,650
I'm definitely going to touch this
video's online.

2412
01:32:52,651 --> 01:32:54,930
There's photos online of guys fucking
dead bodies.

2413
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:56,370
Fuck it.

2414
01:32:56,370 --> 01:32:59,490
There's a voting photo online of a guy
with this where,

2415
01:32:59,540 --> 01:33:01,790
I don't know if it's still up.
This was years ago.

2416
01:33:01,791 --> 01:33:05,660
This was in the late nineties,
early two thousands and there was a

2417
01:33:05,661 --> 01:33:10,460
whole sequence of photos from start to
finish of this woman up being on the

2418
01:33:10,461 --> 01:33:12,260
slab.
She's clearly dead,

2419
01:33:12,290 --> 01:33:15,710
you know,
and then you know him putting his penis

2420
01:33:15,711 --> 01:33:18,050
inside of her and yeah.
And it's like,

2421
01:33:18,051 --> 01:33:19,580
whoa dude.
You know,

2422
01:33:19,581 --> 01:33:23,660
he didn't just take these photos of
someone's daughter and someone's sister,

2423
01:33:23,661 --> 01:33:26,540
someone's wife.
He fucked her and took pictures of it

2424
01:33:26,870 --> 01:33:29,670
and then put it online.
You know,

2425
01:33:30,770 --> 01:33:34,700
some fucking crazy shit man.
I wonder how many people who get into

2426
01:33:34,730 --> 01:33:36,290
um,
like what the,

2427
01:33:36,340 --> 01:33:38,840
what the number is,
how many people get into being a

2428
01:33:38,841 --> 01:33:41,320
mortician or being how many of them in
the sex?

2429
01:33:41,420 --> 01:33:43,550
Yeah.
Fucking around with bodies.

2430
01:33:43,650 --> 01:33:44,820
I'm sure it's very high,
man.

2431
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:47,190
I'm never surprised at the things I
hear.

2432
01:33:47,191 --> 01:33:48,960
And I think if you were in to fucking
dead bodies,

2433
01:33:48,961 --> 01:33:50,250
that would be the number one thing to
do.

2434
01:33:50,280 --> 01:33:53,370
I bet.
How good is the meat and the dead body

2435
01:33:53,371 --> 01:33:55,020
as it is it,
I'm sure it's,

2436
01:33:55,980 --> 01:33:57,380
I'm sure it's juicy.
It's here.

2437
01:33:57,700 --> 01:33:58,650
I know what I'm saying.
I mean,

2438
01:33:58,720 --> 01:34:01,440
get mowed persons rigor mortis set in.
Do they,

2439
01:34:01,470 --> 01:34:05,100
can they fix that too?
They is there a way that they can have

2440
01:34:05,120 --> 01:34:06,990
remorse,
not knots in like what happens when they

2441
01:34:06,991 --> 01:34:09,480
embalm them?
Don't they pump out all the,

2442
01:34:09,580 --> 01:34:11,210
what is Rigor Mortis?
What does that come from?

2443
01:34:11,720 --> 01:34:13,620
Do you know what it comes from?
I think that's when you die.

2444
01:34:13,650 --> 01:34:15,240
The body just difference up.
But I don't think it's,

2445
01:34:15,270 --> 01:34:17,100
I think it took me a squirrel off the
road.

2446
01:34:17,370 --> 01:34:18,630
I think it's an immediate,
oh,

2447
01:34:18,670 --> 01:34:19,650
you get to meet,
I think it's a case.

2448
01:34:19,650 --> 01:34:21,210
It takes a few hours.
Yeah.

2449
01:34:21,230 --> 01:34:23,730
So maybe if you get the person right
after they died,

2450
01:34:23,731 --> 01:34:25,380
they'd be still pliable.
Yeah,

2451
01:34:25,410 --> 01:34:27,210
but don't you like when you die you'll
also,

2452
01:34:27,211 --> 01:34:29,400
you just automatically piss and shit
yourself and all that crap.

2453
01:34:29,430 --> 01:34:30,360
Just cleaned them up,
man.

2454
01:34:30,361 --> 01:34:32,520
If you're going to fuck a dead body,
you can't have high standards.

2455
01:34:32,521 --> 01:34:36,570
So I just
kind of have to warm him up.

2456
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:40,290
Maybe get some lamps are heated blanket
and let them sit in there for awhile or

2457
01:34:40,291 --> 01:34:42,390
something like that.
Put them in a warm tub,

2458
01:34:42,610 --> 01:34:45,770
not warm enough to cook them or how,
you know,

2459
01:34:45,780 --> 01:34:49,050
the cool thing is that you could just
pretty much fucking rip skin if you

2460
01:34:49,100 --> 01:34:51,030
like,
wanted to fuck that ass really hard.

2461
01:34:51,031 --> 01:34:54,120
You know,
you just never have to worry about are

2462
01:34:54,121 --> 01:34:54,954
getting hurt.
Right?

2463
01:34:54,980 --> 01:34:56,280
Yeah,
that's true.

2464
01:34:56,400 --> 01:34:57,650
I guess you could think it that way.

2465
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:02,210
She's a gagger going right through the
back of your throat.

2466
01:35:05,060 --> 01:35:07,070
Something about disrespecting dead
bodies.

2467
01:35:07,071 --> 01:35:10,100
It's particularly offensive,
particularly unsavory.

2468
01:35:10,101 --> 01:35:12,650
You know,
the idea of disrespecting someone's

2469
01:35:12,651 --> 01:35:15,020
body,
their vessel while they're gone.

2470
01:35:15,350 --> 01:35:16,400
You know,
it's so like,

2471
01:35:16,580 --> 01:35:18,470
it's so inhuman,
you know,

2472
01:35:18,471 --> 01:35:20,750
there's something about it that's like,
it's very creepy,

2473
01:35:21,050 --> 01:35:23,450
right?
One of the creepiest things that an

2474
01:35:23,480 --> 01:35:26,750
eating it,
eating someone's body after they're

2475
01:35:26,751 --> 01:35:29,420
dead.
I was listening to,

2476
01:35:29,421 --> 01:35:31,500
um,
Casey case.

2477
01:35:31,510 --> 01:35:32,331
Um,
there were,

2478
01:35:32,331 --> 01:35:33,260
uh,
he's still around.

2479
01:35:33,620 --> 01:35:36,470
I don't know if he's still around.
They had them on the radio though he

2480
01:35:36,471 --> 01:35:38,340
might be dead,
but they had a,

2481
01:35:38,420 --> 01:35:43,420
he was there playing a once from the
1970s I was in Philly and Philly has

2482
01:35:44,541 --> 01:35:46,600
this one bad ass radio station and I
tweeted it out.

2483
01:35:46,601 --> 01:35:49,160
I don't remember the name of it.
It's like w o o g l,

2484
01:35:49,590 --> 01:35:49,920
e,
g,

2485
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:50,570
O l.

2486
01:35:50,570 --> 01:35:55,420
And it was all like one badass song.
It would be like pink Floyd and then it

2487
01:35:55,421 --> 01:35:57,950
would be Michael Jackson and then it
would be like,

2488
01:35:57,951 --> 01:35:59,630
uh,
you know Sam Cooke.

2489
01:35:59,631 --> 01:36:03,140
I mean it was like some serious fucking
jams one after the other knows how this

2490
01:36:03,141 --> 01:36:05,360
pool hall that we were playing at.
And uh,

2491
01:36:05,361 --> 01:36:08,720
they were,
they played like repeats of like the

2492
01:36:09,020 --> 01:36:14,020
countdown show and I forgot like Casey
Kasem with the cow and he would,

2493
01:36:14,151 --> 01:36:15,490
uh,
you just pull that out.

2494
01:36:15,860 --> 01:36:17,030
Never.
First Time I've ever done that too.

2495
01:36:17,090 --> 01:36:19,220
That was awesome.
Here we go.

2496
01:36:20,750 --> 01:36:23,450
This,
this request comes down on outcome.

2497
01:36:23,451 --> 01:36:24,570
Hey Scooby,
come over here.

2498
01:36:24,610 --> 01:36:27,340
[inaudible] some with the countdown.
I can't even do I have,

2499
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:28,660
if I heard him,
I can do it.

2500
01:36:29,900 --> 01:36:30,790
Really?
Can we do?

2501
01:36:31,130 --> 01:36:31,970
Oh yeah,
I didn't know that.

2502
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,700
Yeah,
so weeks.

2503
01:36:35,370 --> 01:36:36,320
Um,
but he was,

2504
01:36:36,570 --> 01:36:41,150
the,
one of the songs apparently was about

2505
01:36:41,180 --> 01:36:45,740
cannibalism and I don't know the song,
but it was about some people that,

2506
01:36:45,741 --> 01:36:46,970
it was like the Donner party.

2507
01:36:46,970 --> 01:36:48,440
It was about like,
you know some people that,

2508
01:36:48,441 --> 01:36:49,550
you know,
the Donner Party story,

2509
01:36:49,700 --> 01:36:52,640
they were headed to the west coast and
they got stuck in the mountains of

2510
01:36:52,641 --> 01:36:54,460
Colorado and they ran out of food and
they,

2511
01:36:54,530 --> 01:36:56,960
some people die and they ate the dead
bodies to stay alive.

2512
01:36:56,980 --> 01:36:58,280
Right.
Parker made a film about it.

2513
01:36:58,440 --> 01:37:00,190
Did it really?
The musical.

2514
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:04,760
What's a cannibal?
The musical when his first movie he made

2515
01:37:04,761 --> 01:37:06,770
in college with Matt Stone,
it's fucking brilliant.

2516
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:08,690
That's really funny cause they're from
Colorado too.

2517
01:37:08,940 --> 01:37:10,210
Yeah,
I fucking love it.

2518
01:37:10,240 --> 01:37:11,770
It's,
it's a brilliant movie.

2519
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:12,890
Cannibal.
The musical.

2520
01:37:12,891 --> 01:37:13,551
Yeah.
Okay.

2521
01:37:13,551 --> 01:37:17,300
I'll have each of your Amazon that shit.
But Casey Casen was going off,

2522
01:37:17,330 --> 01:37:22,330
Casey Kasem about this.
Sometimes you have to make decisions and

2523
01:37:23,031 --> 01:37:24,280
it was like,
the decision was like,

2524
01:37:24,410 --> 01:37:25,700
we,
we like stop playing.

2525
01:37:25,701 --> 01:37:27,550
We're like,
what the fuck is it?

2526
01:37:27,551 --> 01:37:31,850
It's like you have to make a decision
between eating the body or dying

2527
01:37:31,851 --> 01:37:32,684
yourself.

2528
01:37:32,930 --> 01:37:34,130
And we were like,
what the fuck?

2529
01:37:34,131 --> 01:37:34,964
Wow.
What,

2530
01:37:35,030 --> 01:37:36,890
what a weird,
you know,

2531
01:37:37,160 --> 01:37:39,520
top 40 or whatever the fuck it was.
Or,

2532
01:37:39,860 --> 01:37:40,940
you know,
a song is,

2533
01:37:41,460 --> 01:37:43,250
I mean,
I think it was a request,

2534
01:37:43,610 --> 01:37:46,550
you know,
I only like tuned into it halfway while

2535
01:37:46,551 --> 01:37:48,170
he was saying it,
but you know,

2536
01:37:48,470 --> 01:37:51,890
it was one of the weird thing.
This next song deals with cannibalism

2537
01:37:52,390 --> 01:37:55,890
and it was like what?
Like how many times in history of people

2538
01:37:55,891 --> 01:37:57,300
had to eat?
People stay alive.

2539
01:37:57,330 --> 01:37:59,550
There's only like a few recorded
instances,

2540
01:37:59,551 --> 01:38:02,040
right?
There's a soccer team that crashed in a

2541
01:38:02,041 --> 01:38:04,200
plane crash and they made that movie
about them.

2542
01:38:04,440 --> 01:38:06,510
Remember their spoon?
Yeah.

2543
01:38:06,511 --> 01:38:09,180
They're spooning that guy's ass out.
Oh yeah.

2544
01:38:09,200 --> 01:38:12,060
Eight is the frozen asked meet with a
spoon.

2545
01:38:12,090 --> 01:38:15,750
That was a freaky ass movie man when
that that airplane broke apart.

2546
01:38:15,780 --> 01:38:17,390
Yeah.
Yeah.

2547
01:38:17,460 --> 01:38:21,270
Tubes made out of metal aren't really
meant to fly through the fucking sky.

2548
01:38:21,570 --> 01:38:22,410
Yeah.
You know,

2549
01:38:22,450 --> 01:38:24,720
I was thinking the other day is what
happened to all those lots of people.

2550
01:38:24,750 --> 01:38:28,320
You notice how like all these actors
from loss were so high in their career

2551
01:38:28,321 --> 01:38:31,440
and now do you see any of them?
They burnt off and he didn't want to

2552
01:38:31,441 --> 01:38:33,420
have anything to do with them.
Jack was pissing me off.

2553
01:38:33,421 --> 01:38:35,100
Man.
I know after a while,

2554
01:38:35,101 --> 01:38:36,780
man,
he really annoyed the shit out of me,

2555
01:38:36,781 --> 01:38:38,160
man.
He drove me nuts.

2556
01:38:38,280 --> 01:38:42,630
He was so phoning it in at the end when
they're all standing around that tub and

2557
01:38:42,631 --> 01:38:46,360
someone comes back to life like this
mother fucker is just phoning it in man.

2558
01:38:47,990 --> 01:38:48,721
Yeah,
he drove me.

2559
01:38:48,721 --> 01:38:51,240
It drove me nuts cause he wasn't
appreciating his fucking,

2560
01:38:51,420 --> 01:38:52,350
his,
his part.

2561
01:38:52,590 --> 01:38:56,010
He was,
he started off that series as a winner.

2562
01:38:56,190 --> 01:38:58,560
Jack was the fucking hero.
He was the man,

2563
01:38:58,561 --> 01:38:59,610
you know,
he was a doctor,

2564
01:38:59,611 --> 01:39:00,300
he was handsome.

2565
01:39:00,300 --> 01:39:03,540
All the girls loved him.
And by the end he was a junkie and a

2566
01:39:03,541 --> 01:39:05,910
loser.
And you know what they did was,

2567
01:39:05,940 --> 01:39:08,360
I guarantee you that guy's annoying.
A guarantee.

2568
01:39:08,390 --> 01:39:11,220
That actor is annoying and they're like,
the fuck this guy.

2569
01:39:11,221 --> 01:39:12,600
Like,
well let's just start making them a

2570
01:39:12,730 --> 01:39:16,680
douchebag and start slowly like making a
more and more annoying.

2571
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:19,230
Fuck yeah,
they must have done that.

2572
01:39:19,650 --> 01:39:23,100
Cause how if he was so cool,
everybody else sort of like kept their,

2573
01:39:23,130 --> 01:39:26,250
their thing or became more cool as the
show went on.

2574
01:39:26,580 --> 01:39:29,430
You know,
like the really hot girl with no ass.

2575
01:39:29,431 --> 01:39:32,370
What's her name?
The really pretty one with the dark hair

2576
01:39:32,371 --> 01:39:33,940
with a fucking beautiful case.
Kate.

2577
01:39:34,500 --> 01:39:38,100
She sorta became cooler as time went on.
We got her shit together,

2578
01:39:38,340 --> 01:39:39,960
you know,
raise that girl's baby,

2579
01:39:39,961 --> 01:39:41,610
you know,
she had a like a lot of good positive

2580
01:39:41,611 --> 01:39:42,300
attributes.

2581
01:39:42,300 --> 01:39:46,050
John Locke became like mysterious and
sort of magical and sort of figured out

2582
01:39:46,051 --> 01:39:48,060
the world.
Jack just became a junkie.

2583
01:39:48,300 --> 01:39:50,380
Just became a fucking loser man.
Yeah,

2584
01:39:50,790 --> 01:39:52,260
he just slowly,
the reason for that,

2585
01:39:52,261 --> 01:39:56,130
if you saw the last episode,
last episode can suck my Dick.

2586
01:39:56,640 --> 01:40:01,590
I mean ain't fucking with that man.
I think this much and you have some

2587
01:40:01,591 --> 01:40:03,360
freedom and walking away for it,
man.

2588
01:40:03,810 --> 01:40:06,960
You watched so much of it that you might
as well see what happens.

2589
01:40:07,140 --> 01:40:08,940
There's some freedom and just saying,
no,

2590
01:40:08,941 --> 01:40:10,830
you don't have me anymore.
You fucks.

2591
01:40:11,340 --> 01:40:13,440
You can't.
You can't own me bitch.

2592
01:40:13,710 --> 01:40:15,300
I'm not your whore.
All right,

2593
01:40:15,301 --> 01:40:18,210
I'm not tuning in every week to watch
your stupid commercials.

2594
01:40:18,420 --> 01:40:20,700
Just so you can trick me with your silly
storyline.

2595
01:40:21,030 --> 01:40:23,460
I don't even watch TV anymore,
it seems like,

2596
01:40:23,610 --> 01:40:27,390
but once you start fucking throwing in
like time travel and shit like they did

2597
01:40:27,391 --> 01:40:28,470
and now we're in 1970.

2598
01:40:28,500 --> 01:40:29,850
All right.
You don't even know what happened.

2599
01:40:29,880 --> 01:40:32,040
You're fucked so you can do anything.
You want your fucks.

2600
01:40:32,220 --> 01:40:33,380
There's a reason why.
Yeah,

2601
01:40:33,930 --> 01:40:35,280
I can tell you as it is,
they can switch.

2602
01:40:35,281 --> 01:40:36,180
You like to know.
Nope.

2603
01:40:36,300 --> 01:40:39,300
I don't want to know that.
You want me to know and then I don't

2604
01:40:39,301 --> 01:40:41,250
want to know.
I love that there's freedom in that man.

2605
01:40:42,130 --> 01:40:43,800
All right.
He was a girl the whole time.

2606
01:40:43,950 --> 01:40:45,210
He was a girl.
Oh good,

2607
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:46,500
good.
He seemed like a girl.

2608
01:40:46,530 --> 01:40:48,060
He was,
Kate seemed like he was on his period

2609
01:40:48,061 --> 01:40:50,730
for 10 years.
Fucking Twat.

2610
01:40:53,140 --> 01:40:54,600
Jesus.
Um,

2611
01:40:54,730 --> 01:40:57,310
anything else before we,
before we get going,

2612
01:40:57,311 --> 01:41:01,600
there were some questions on the Rogan
board that I'm perusing through and some

2613
01:41:01,601 --> 01:41:04,810
of them we've actually already answered
and um,

2614
01:41:05,320 --> 01:41:06,670
some of them,
here's just like one,

2615
01:41:06,671 --> 01:41:08,800
what are your thoughts on listener
supporting the fod cat,

2616
01:41:08,830 --> 01:41:11,410
the podcast financially,
if it's not necessary?

2617
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:12,940
The podcast,
as I said,

2618
01:41:12,970 --> 01:41:17,530
is a great method for me to promote
shows and promote all the other stuff

2619
01:41:17,531 --> 01:41:21,190
that we do and we get sponsorships.
The more you guys listen,

2620
01:41:21,191 --> 01:41:23,620
the more we get sponsors.
I mean we just have this flashlight

2621
01:41:23,621 --> 01:41:25,660
right now,
but that's mostly because we're going to

2622
01:41:25,661 --> 01:41:30,580
be moving to serious very soon both.
Obviously we will still be live and free

2623
01:41:30,581 --> 01:41:32,890
on the Internet.
It's still be on iTunes for free.

2624
01:41:33,070 --> 01:41:35,410
It's still be available for download on
the website for free,

2625
01:41:35,590 --> 01:41:37,960
but it will also be on Sirius satellite
satellite radio,

2626
01:41:37,961 --> 01:41:39,940
just so more people can listen to it and
just,

2627
01:41:40,240 --> 01:41:41,950
you know,
I like serious.

2628
01:41:41,950 --> 01:41:43,030
I have it in my car.
It's,

2629
01:41:43,031 --> 01:41:47,410
it's an awesome service and I think it's
just another avenue for us to get heard

2630
01:41:47,440 --> 01:41:48,900
and you know,
we're not even getting paid for it.

2631
01:41:48,901 --> 01:41:50,490
The same thing as like stitcher and all
that.

2632
01:41:50,500 --> 01:41:53,020
I'm,
I'm for all of those things and the more

2633
01:41:53,021 --> 01:41:55,300
of these things that we do,
the more it,

2634
01:41:55,301 --> 01:41:56,750
you know,
it it like,

2635
01:41:56,830 --> 01:41:58,810
I've never had this many people come to
my shows.

2636
01:41:58,811 --> 01:42:00,580
I've never had,
I mean this is obviously,

2637
01:42:00,581 --> 01:42:02,160
this is a good thing,
you know,

2638
01:42:02,161 --> 01:42:06,040
it's obvious that there's a benefit for
me in that and the promotional aspect of

2639
01:42:06,041 --> 01:42:09,040
it and is a benefit in people that they
get this free entertainment man.

2640
01:42:09,310 --> 01:42:10,780
And it's a benefit for us too,
you know,

2641
01:42:10,810 --> 01:42:13,360
over the course of the year.
So that we've been doing this.

2642
01:42:13,570 --> 01:42:16,140
One of the coolest things that it really
made me appreciate it.

2643
01:42:16,150 --> 01:42:19,120
I was bummed out when I had to come back
here from Colorado.

2644
01:42:19,660 --> 01:42:20,161
You know,
I,

2645
01:42:20,161 --> 01:42:23,800
I have this idea of raising my kids in a
place where it's a little more calm,

2646
01:42:23,801 --> 01:42:26,170
there's less people,
there's less of the pressures of

2647
01:42:26,171 --> 01:42:27,040
Hollywood,
the,

2648
01:42:27,270 --> 01:42:29,390
there's sort of the bullshit materialism
of,

2649
01:42:29,400 --> 01:42:31,270
of this area,
this part of the country.

2650
01:42:31,450 --> 01:42:33,850
It's a silly part of the country.
There's a lot of cool people here,

2651
01:42:33,880 --> 01:42:36,070
but it's also a very silly part of the
country.

2652
01:42:36,340 --> 01:42:37,720
So I was bummed out,
man,

2653
01:42:37,721 --> 01:42:41,470
when the dog got eaten by the mountain
line and when Mrs Rogan got pregnant,

2654
01:42:41,471 --> 01:42:42,370
we had to come back.
I mean,

2655
01:42:42,371 --> 01:42:43,720
it was,
to me it was like,

2656
01:42:43,721 --> 01:42:45,010
fuck,
I was gone.

2657
01:42:45,011 --> 01:42:46,420
I made it out of this place.
I was,

2658
01:42:46,421 --> 01:42:48,790
I was,
I had escaped and now I'm back again.

2659
01:42:49,030 --> 01:42:54,030
But what really like made me appreciate
this place was this podcast and was

2660
01:42:55,631 --> 01:42:57,700
having all these cool people come over
all the time.

2661
01:42:57,820 --> 01:43:00,100
Having Ari over,
having eddy over,

2662
01:43:00,101 --> 01:43:01,480
having Joe,
we over Evan,

2663
01:43:01,630 --> 01:43:04,180
Bert Kreischer and Russell Peters and
Tom Green.

2664
01:43:04,181 --> 01:43:04,841
And I'm like,
you know,

2665
01:43:04,841 --> 01:43:06,100
I sit back and I go,
God,

2666
01:43:06,101 --> 01:43:08,350
this is so much fucking fun.
You know,

2667
01:43:08,380 --> 01:43:13,380
somehow or another we have like a real
legit national radio show and not even

2668
01:43:13,601 --> 01:43:18,220
national man worldwide because we had a
fuck load of podcast fans in Australia

2669
01:43:18,880 --> 01:43:20,530
that's on the other side of the fucking
planet.

2670
01:43:20,680 --> 01:43:22,420
And when,
when I asked them about the podcast,

2671
01:43:22,421 --> 01:43:23,890
they went nuts.
So it's,

2672
01:43:23,891 --> 01:43:25,840
it's,
it's a worldwide sort of a thing,

2673
01:43:25,841 --> 01:43:26,860
man.
And you know,

2674
01:43:26,861 --> 01:43:31,270
and
who the fuck knew when we did this that

2675
01:43:31,271 --> 01:43:34,240
it would be what it is now?
Who knew that every week would be in

2676
01:43:34,241 --> 01:43:34,751
the,
you know,

2677
01:43:34,751 --> 01:43:37,450
the top five of iTunes?
Who the fuck we had never,

2678
01:43:37,451 --> 01:43:40,840
I had no idea.
It was completely by chance.

2679
01:43:41,020 --> 01:43:45,430
And slowly along the line it's morphed
and slowly along the line it's evolved

2680
01:43:45,670 --> 01:43:47,940
and slowly along the line it's become,
you know,

2681
01:43:47,950 --> 01:43:49,720
like something,
it's,

2682
01:43:49,721 --> 01:43:51,010
it's,
it is itself,

2683
01:43:51,590 --> 01:43:52,280
you know what I mean?

2684
01:43:52,280 --> 01:43:53,900
Like now we don't think about how to do
it.

2685
01:43:53,920 --> 01:43:57,650
Like we came over here,
like Brian came over here today and we

2686
01:43:57,651 --> 01:44:00,500
didn't even have to talk about when we
talked about just normal shit like we

2687
01:44:00,501 --> 01:44:02,600
always do,
but this is our hundredth episode.

2688
01:44:02,601 --> 01:44:04,130
Man was a big deal,
but we're like,

2689
01:44:04,160 --> 01:44:05,360
but we should do it.
We were like,

2690
01:44:05,361 --> 01:44:06,171
wow,
we should do it together.

2691
01:44:06,171 --> 01:44:06,831
Yeah.
It's just sue,

2692
01:44:06,831 --> 01:44:08,840
you and me for the hundredth.
And then that was the,

2693
01:44:08,841 --> 01:44:11,750
all the thing we had to talk about.
It's like it is its own thing,

2694
01:44:11,930 --> 01:44:12,681
you know,
it is,

2695
01:44:12,681 --> 01:44:17,120
it's got its own life to it now and all
the people that send me emails,

2696
01:44:17,121 --> 01:44:20,600
man and all the Twitter messages and all
the people that I meet in the comedy

2697
01:44:20,601 --> 01:44:23,810
clubs,
I appreciate the fuck out of that.

2698
01:44:23,811 --> 01:44:28,190
I think it is.
One of my biggest accomplishments in my

2699
01:44:28,191 --> 01:44:32,390
career is this podcast and that that
message board and both of those things

2700
01:44:32,600 --> 01:44:33,440
and that the,
the,

2701
01:44:33,441 --> 01:44:35,190
the whole,
the whole Internet group,

2702
01:44:35,191 --> 01:44:38,050
but bringing all these cool people
together and the,

2703
01:44:38,070 --> 01:44:41,210
the positive energy that I get from all
of these people at shows and the

2704
01:44:41,211 --> 01:44:44,780
positive reactions that I get so many
people coming up to me and telling me

2705
01:44:44,781 --> 01:44:47,540
that this podcast helps them think
differently.

2706
01:44:47,540 --> 01:44:50,600
It changes the way they look at life.
It changes the way they view their

2707
01:44:50,601 --> 01:44:52,790
friends.
Change the way that you view how they

2708
01:44:52,791 --> 01:44:54,740
interact with other people.
You know,

2709
01:44:54,741 --> 01:44:57,260
I couldn't be happier man.
I couldn't be happier that we did this

2710
01:44:57,261 --> 01:44:59,290
and this wouldn't have happened if I
didn't give in and,

2711
01:44:59,291 --> 01:45:02,420
and come back from Colorado.
If I decided to stay in Colorado,

2712
01:45:02,421 --> 01:45:03,620
we would have never have done this.
You know?

2713
01:45:03,680 --> 01:45:06,320
What about the idea of getting like a
female sidekick?

2714
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:07,760
A,
I'll take a whole,

2715
01:45:08,320 --> 01:45:11,300
a whole robbing Chris Rogan's not really
down with that.

2716
01:45:13,380 --> 01:45:14,001
Yeah.
Oh,

2717
01:45:14,001 --> 01:45:15,920
did you hear that he slept as coffee
again?

2718
01:45:15,921 --> 01:45:17,720
Then the fuck filled it out.
Load for you.

2719
01:45:18,050 --> 01:45:19,370
Yeah.
If you hear suburban man,

2720
01:45:19,380 --> 01:45:20,360
that's me.
Blame me.

2721
01:45:20,720 --> 01:45:21,590
Um,
yeah.

2722
01:45:21,591 --> 01:45:24,080
You Know Adam Carolla had a really funny
girl on his show.

2723
01:45:24,380 --> 01:45:27,080
He had Theresa Strasser for Awhile and
she was really funny and now he's got

2724
01:45:27,081 --> 01:45:29,700
this new chick and a lot of people on
the Rogan board didn't like her.

2725
01:45:29,750 --> 01:45:31,430
But I thought she was funny.
She made me laugh.

2726
01:45:31,610 --> 01:45:32,990
The crazy thing about that is they
ought,

2727
01:45:32,991 --> 01:45:36,320
he had auditioned a few girls like
Esther little Esther went there.

2728
01:45:36,340 --> 01:45:37,760
Oh that's how this girl got it.
Yeah.

2729
01:45:37,761 --> 01:45:40,220
And I guess,
but what's crazy is like if you go to

2730
01:45:40,221 --> 01:45:42,980
his website and look at all the comments
per episode,

2731
01:45:43,250 --> 01:45:48,110
every single one of the girls that he
did like all hate,

2732
01:45:48,170 --> 01:45:52,520
like his,
his audience hates so bad girl on any

2733
01:45:52,521 --> 01:45:54,440
girl that's on his show.
I feel so bad.

2734
01:45:54,650 --> 01:45:55,970
Or Brody Stevens,
those.

2735
01:45:56,090 --> 01:45:58,460
So the girls and Brody,
who was the new girl?

2736
01:45:58,700 --> 01:45:59,211
Uh,
you know,

2737
01:45:59,211 --> 01:46:01,020
I think her name is like,
uh,

2738
01:46:01,610 --> 01:46:03,130
Jesse or something like that or no,
no,

2739
01:46:03,140 --> 01:46:05,930
I'm looking for,
I'm going to look at it right now cause

2740
01:46:05,931 --> 01:46:07,490
I feel rude that we're talking about our
own.

2741
01:46:07,491 --> 01:46:09,080
Nothing in her name.
Yeah.

2742
01:46:09,090 --> 01:46:10,490
That's gotta be cool to have Adam
Carolla on.

2743
01:46:11,180 --> 01:46:12,620
He's going to be on this,
this,

2744
01:46:12,621 --> 01:46:13,490
uh,
next week.

2745
01:46:13,670 --> 01:46:14,930
Next Tuesday.
Yeah.

2746
01:46:15,270 --> 01:46:16,490
Yeah.
In your formula,

2747
01:46:16,491 --> 01:46:18,240
uh,
that you've been working with on,

2748
01:46:18,310 --> 01:46:20,780
on it.com o n n I.
T.

2749
01:46:20,781 --> 01:46:22,520
A cause it's almost done.
It's on its way.

2750
01:46:22,790 --> 01:46:24,920
I was reading the,
did you read the case study?

2751
01:46:24,921 --> 01:46:26,300
That,
that's pretty interesting.

2752
01:46:26,330 --> 01:46:27,170
Yeah.
A lot of people,

2753
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:29,270
look,
I've been taking five HTP and I've had

2754
01:46:29,280 --> 01:46:33,440
some pretty powerful results.
I feel like it makes a sentences form

2755
01:46:33,470 --> 01:46:35,900
easier.
I feel like there's more circulation to

2756
01:46:35,901 --> 01:46:37,970
my brain or something,
and then I don't know what it is.

2757
01:46:37,971 --> 01:46:41,720
But five HTP has given me a,
a very tangible benefit.

2758
01:46:41,900 --> 01:46:44,690
And there's some other stuff that I took
that gave me some good benefits as well.

2759
01:46:44,691 --> 01:46:48,530
But what we did with Chris did with this
new tropic formula at school,

2760
01:46:48,531 --> 01:46:50,880
like Alpha brainwave,
nootropic formula is going to call it.

2761
01:46:51,240 --> 01:46:54,570
What we did was take all of the best
nootropics,

2762
01:46:54,571 --> 01:46:57,990
which are nutrients for the brain and
condensed them into a,

2763
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:01,170
into,
I think it's like two pills and it's all

2764
01:47:01,171 --> 01:47:02,640
these people.
The case studies had some really

2765
01:47:02,641 --> 01:47:04,210
positive experiences with it.
Yeah,

2766
01:47:04,290 --> 01:47:06,240
I'm excited.
It's all legit stuff.

2767
01:47:06,270 --> 01:47:10,470
It's all stuff that people have reported
actually helps brain function.

2768
01:47:10,590 --> 01:47:14,670
We're going to combine it into one thing
and I think nutrition and you know,

2769
01:47:14,671 --> 01:47:18,420
mental nutrition and physical nutrition,
all of it is one of the most underlooked

2770
01:47:18,450 --> 01:47:20,600
keys to happiness for people.
You know,

2771
01:47:21,230 --> 01:47:24,670
I mean we have a friend that got on
antidepressants and this motherfucker

2772
01:47:24,690 --> 01:47:26,340
eats Cheetos every night.
It never works out.

2773
01:47:26,341 --> 01:47:27,210
And I was like,
Yo Dude,

2774
01:47:27,211 --> 01:47:28,770
you know,
if you took care of that body,

2775
01:47:28,771 --> 01:47:30,810
I guarantee you you would feel a little
bit better.

2776
01:47:30,811 --> 01:47:31,520
I mean you,
you,

2777
01:47:31,520 --> 01:47:32,310
yeah.
I mean,

2778
01:47:32,310 --> 01:47:35,400
I'm not saying you don't have an issue
that maybe needs to be corrected

2779
01:47:35,401 --> 01:47:37,770
chemically cause I'm not,
I'm not inside your head,

2780
01:47:37,950 --> 01:47:40,830
but I know for a fact my own brain,
if I didn't work out,

2781
01:47:40,831 --> 01:47:44,790
I would not be nearly as happy.
I would have all this extra pent up shit

2782
01:47:44,791 --> 01:47:47,760
and you got to get that out man.
And you've got to treat this fucking

2783
01:47:47,761 --> 01:47:48,240
vehicle.

2784
01:47:48,240 --> 01:47:49,920
Good.
Give this vehicle vitamins,

2785
01:47:49,921 --> 01:47:53,010
van.
I drink fresh squeezed juices every

2786
01:47:53,010 --> 01:47:54,980
morning.
Every morning when I'm at home I squeeze

2787
01:47:55,030 --> 01:47:58,110
a,
I get ginger and raw garlic and carrots

2788
01:47:58,111 --> 01:48:02,340
and celery and I blended all together
and you feel so fucking good.

2789
01:48:02,341 --> 01:48:05,250
It's great getting all those raw
nutrients in your body and your body.

2790
01:48:05,490 --> 01:48:07,110
You know,
two people that I know,

2791
01:48:07,111 --> 01:48:09,300
I have a lot of friends who are very,
very smart,

2792
01:48:09,450 --> 01:48:14,450
but they almost think that there's
something vain and trivial and foolish

2793
01:48:14,911 --> 01:48:16,800
about taking care of your body.
You know,

2794
01:48:16,801 --> 01:48:18,450
they smoked cigarettes or they,
they,

2795
01:48:18,451 --> 01:48:20,580
they,
they eat shitty food and you know,

2796
01:48:20,720 --> 01:48:22,590
and they never exercise.
They never had to take care of

2797
01:48:22,591 --> 01:48:23,071
themselves.
Like,

2798
01:48:23,071 --> 01:48:25,800
man,
you're missing out on a big chunk of

2799
01:48:25,801 --> 01:48:27,480
life.
It's annoying.

2800
01:48:27,510 --> 01:48:30,240
It's annoying to have to go to the gym.
That's why it's good to learn a martial

2801
01:48:30,241 --> 01:48:33,300
art or it's good to like to pick up a
sport or racquetball or something where

2802
01:48:33,450 --> 01:48:35,910
you're forced to move around.
You know where it's fun.

2803
01:48:35,911 --> 01:48:39,120
It's part of the whole game.
But find some way,

2804
01:48:39,150 --> 01:48:42,110
find some way to take care of your
fucking Bonnie fines on fucking away

2805
01:48:42,120 --> 01:48:43,980
man.
Take some fucking vitamins.

2806
01:48:43,981 --> 01:48:46,440
Even if it's just multivitamins and fish
oil,

2807
01:48:46,441 --> 01:48:49,530
even if it's just that,
that will make a fucking difference.

2808
01:48:49,890 --> 01:48:51,330
And so many people don't,
man,

2809
01:48:51,331 --> 01:48:53,890
so many people just ride it out and they
just hope it all was going to

2810
01:48:54,140 --> 01:48:58,090
can stay together.
I switched my five HTP two Chris's

2811
01:48:58,091 --> 01:49:00,590
brand,
which is called Ron or rollover are,

2812
01:49:00,610 --> 01:49:02,530
can't remember which one it is.
It's the blue bottle.

2813
01:49:02,590 --> 01:49:03,371
Yeah.
And uh,

2814
01:49:03,371 --> 01:49:04,330
it's,
it's great to,

2815
01:49:04,331 --> 01:49:07,270
it's,
that's 175 milligrams I think it was.

2816
01:49:07,271 --> 01:49:09,210
And you feel a difference after taking a
photo shoot?

2817
01:49:09,430 --> 01:49:14,110
I've been taking it for over a month and
that in the reservoir patrol I think are

2818
01:49:14,350 --> 01:49:16,210
two of the best things I've take.
I take,

2819
01:49:16,211 --> 01:49:19,240
I take fish oil in a multi,
multi vitamin everyday,

2820
01:49:19,300 --> 01:49:22,600
but I think those two are the things
that I've noticed the biggest from.

2821
01:49:22,720 --> 01:49:26,080
How much do you think cigarettes fuck
with you owe a lot.

2822
01:49:26,110 --> 01:49:27,110
Definitely.
Yeah.

2823
01:49:27,190 --> 01:49:28,270
Yeah.
Does it bother you

2824
01:49:28,650 --> 01:49:30,150
doing that?
That you're poisoning yourself with

2825
01:49:30,151 --> 01:49:31,680
cigarettes?
Cause I've seen you before,

2826
01:49:31,681 --> 01:49:32,251
dude.
There's,

2827
01:49:32,251 --> 01:49:34,260
there's Times that I've seen you when
you were smoking a lot.

2828
01:49:34,440 --> 01:49:36,960
When you take on,
like you have a great quality to your,

2829
01:49:37,260 --> 01:49:40,400
he's,
it's almost like I'm serious man.

2830
01:49:40,620 --> 01:49:41,570
And you,
when you quit,

2831
01:49:41,590 --> 01:49:42,051
you,
you know,

2832
01:49:42,051 --> 01:49:43,320
what is that great?
You know what that is?

2833
01:49:43,321 --> 01:49:45,780
Is I have a great beard.
No,

2834
01:49:45,800 --> 01:49:46,633
and if I,
if,

2835
01:49:46,910 --> 01:49:49,720
if shave it,
it's great for the first three days.

2836
01:49:49,810 --> 01:49:51,070
No Man.
I mean,

2837
01:49:51,090 --> 01:49:52,810
um,
I mean like your eyes,

2838
01:49:53,140 --> 01:49:55,870
like around your eyes.
Like you,

2839
01:49:55,871 --> 01:49:59,890
there's something about smoking.
So I'm thinking about a lot of that

2840
01:49:59,891 --> 01:50:03,490
cigarette smoke in your system where
like your whole system looks like,

2841
01:50:07,750 --> 01:50:09,610
you know,
it looks like your whole system is being

2842
01:50:09,611 --> 01:50:11,380
poisoned slowly.
Well it is.

2843
01:50:11,620 --> 01:50:14,620
Why don't you fucking quit crazy bitch.
Hi.

2844
01:50:14,621 --> 01:50:18,790
Well you won't know what makes you say
you're going to quit waiting for the

2845
01:50:18,791 --> 01:50:20,200
first stroke.
The best part.

2846
01:50:20,440 --> 01:50:22,660
Is that what it can do?
And you going to go Vegan?

2847
01:50:22,670 --> 01:50:25,570
All my grandfather.
Your grandfather had a stroke?

2848
01:50:25,610 --> 01:50:26,560
Yeah.
From smoking.

2849
01:50:26,650 --> 01:50:27,340
Really?
Yeah.

2850
01:50:27,340 --> 01:50:32,340
Oh look at you live in smart and it was
like 65 oh,

2851
01:50:32,771 --> 01:50:34,640
so you feel like you've got a few years?
Yeah.

2852
01:50:34,650 --> 01:50:38,020
Okay.
Well what isn't there like a a point of

2853
01:50:38,021 --> 01:50:40,300
no return?
Like where you've done so much damage

2854
01:50:40,301 --> 01:50:41,940
that you can never heal yourself up?
No.

2855
01:50:41,941 --> 01:50:44,770
I mean well to a point if you get cancer
obviously,

2856
01:50:44,771 --> 01:50:47,560
but I mean there's a chart.
I think like after a year you're pretty

2857
01:50:47,561 --> 01:50:48,990
much back to normal,
your religion,

2858
01:50:49,030 --> 01:50:51,910
your lung capacity and all that stuff.
There's actually a thing where like if

2859
01:50:51,911 --> 01:50:53,750
you quit the first week,
that first day,

2860
01:50:54,300 --> 01:50:55,660
what keeps you from quitting?
Quitting?

2861
01:50:55,690 --> 01:50:57,370
I mean you've taken those nicotine
patches.

2862
01:50:57,371 --> 01:50:58,810
Can you just jam knows?
Yeah,

2863
01:50:58,811 --> 01:51:00,240
I mean it's just doing it.
I mean,

2864
01:51:00,940 --> 01:51:02,440
seriously smoking.
You see,

2865
01:51:02,441 --> 01:51:04,280
I wish you could tell I the,
the,

2866
01:51:04,290 --> 01:51:06,460
the addiction.
I wish I could too because Marin's

2867
01:51:06,461 --> 01:51:07,510
complaining about it all the time.

2868
01:51:07,510 --> 01:51:10,210
He's always on his Twitter talking about
they're putting nicotine patches on

2869
01:51:10,211 --> 01:51:11,950
shit.
It's always going to be there like that

2870
01:51:11,951 --> 01:51:13,600
voice in the back of your head.
Even if you quit,

2871
01:51:13,630 --> 01:51:15,190
it's still there.
Joey's in denial.

2872
01:51:15,640 --> 01:51:18,670
Joey likes to pretend he's not smoking.
You know me dog.

2873
01:51:18,820 --> 01:51:21,460
I don't need that shit.
While every time before a show he's

2874
01:51:21,461 --> 01:51:22,420
bummed cigarettes off.
Yeah,

2875
01:51:22,600 --> 01:51:23,440
right.
Yeah.

2876
01:51:23,470 --> 01:51:26,050
I always have to buy two packs every
time I'm hanging out with him.

2877
01:51:26,051 --> 01:51:28,640
Helium gave me some cigars.
Helium was the shit.

2878
01:51:28,641 --> 01:51:30,110
I fucking love it there.
Yeah,

2879
01:51:30,230 --> 01:51:34,660
to helium's we did this month Portland
and filling Baltimore fucking awesome.

2880
01:51:34,900 --> 01:51:38,200
For those folks that are interested in
the Massey Hall and Toronto Show,

2881
01:51:38,410 --> 01:51:41,230
the only tickets that are left are like
single tickets.

2882
01:51:41,560 --> 01:51:43,030
But you know,
man,

2883
01:51:43,031 --> 01:51:47,560
if you want to go to separate seats,
sitting separate seats or you know,

2884
01:51:47,590 --> 01:51:49,840
get people to move or something,
who the fuck knows?

2885
01:51:49,840 --> 01:51:52,060
But I just go and have fun and it's
going to be chaos.

2886
01:51:52,210 --> 01:51:54,730
And I'm doing it with Sam Tripoli.
But other than that,

2887
01:51:54,731 --> 01:51:57,850
it's sold out.
And for the June 11th,

2888
01:51:58,020 --> 01:51:59,440
I think it's,
what is the date,

2889
01:51:59,720 --> 01:52:01,990
by the way?
Same Aaa got a Fohawk Nolan on now.

01:52:02,110 --> 01:52:05,710
Really Silly Bastard Sam Tripoli's

2892
01:52:07,660 --> 01:52:09,430
he'll be opening for me.
And um,

2893
01:52:09,910 --> 01:52:12,160
I said June,
he's so excited about it too.

2894
01:52:12,161 --> 01:52:14,220
He's like,
I'll never play a bigger show than this

2895
01:52:14,230 --> 01:52:14,670
ever.
He,

2896
01:52:14,670 --> 01:52:15,431
he,
he's,

2897
01:52:15,431 --> 01:52:16,540
he's gone crazy.
And by the way,

2898
01:52:16,541 --> 01:52:19,840
San Francisco is May 12th through the
May 14th.

2899
01:52:19,900 --> 01:52:22,270
And that's at Cobb's comedy club.
Yep.

2900
01:52:22,300 --> 01:52:24,750
June 10th is the Vancouver date.
And uh,

2901
01:52:24,820 --> 01:52:29,030
April 29th is the Toronto Date in April
29th,

2902
01:52:29,100 --> 01:52:32,800
I said there's only a few tickets left.
And then the other thing is cobb's in

2903
01:52:32,801 --> 01:52:33,700
San Francisco.
Yeah.

2904
01:52:33,880 --> 01:52:37,930
It's already selling very fast at 12th
through the 14th because slow death.

2905
01:52:38,020 --> 01:52:38,853
Scott,
who's going there?

2906
01:52:39,250 --> 01:52:39,731
Uh,
yeah,

2907
01:52:39,731 --> 01:52:41,450
probably whoever's around,
you know,

2908
01:52:41,451 --> 01:52:43,720
if Joey and I can do it though,
you know how we do it.

2909
01:52:43,990 --> 01:52:46,160
It's like always getting a of a headline

2910
01:52:46,160 --> 01:52:47,810
gigs now,
which is very nice.

2911
01:52:47,811 --> 01:52:49,700
Yeah.
Always headline and all over the place

2912
01:52:49,701 --> 01:52:52,580
he's doing,
I'm doing comedy competitions.

2913
01:52:52,581 --> 01:52:53,850
He's doing or um,
you know,

2914
01:52:53,851 --> 01:52:55,070
um,
comedy festivals.

2915
01:52:55,250 --> 01:52:57,320
He says got back from Atlanta and he
goes,

2916
01:52:57,321 --> 01:52:57,940
uh,
it goes,

2917
01:52:57,940 --> 01:52:58,510
uh,
uh,

2918
01:52:58,510 --> 01:52:59,380
rulers though.
Something.

2919
01:52:59,381 --> 01:53:00,800
I was like,
why does this feel so weird?

2920
01:53:01,040 --> 01:53:03,650
And then someone said,
because you're the most famous comic

2921
01:53:03,651 --> 01:53:04,550
here,
it's like,

2922
01:53:04,580 --> 01:53:05,720
oh,
I'm not comfortable with that.

2923
01:53:06,020 --> 01:53:07,460
And I go,
you're not comfortable with that because

2924
01:53:07,461 --> 01:53:09,830
that's responsibility.
You feel like responsible for like the

2925
01:53:09,831 --> 01:53:11,140
young pucks,
you know,

2926
01:53:11,141 --> 01:53:12,110
like,
is that what it feels like?

2927
01:53:12,111 --> 01:53:12,531
He's a,
yeah,

2928
01:53:12,531 --> 01:53:14,090
that is what it is.
Like I go,

2929
01:53:14,091 --> 01:53:16,910
you shy away from every responsibility
possible.

2930
01:53:17,660 --> 01:53:19,430
Even being like the most famous
comedian,

2931
01:53:19,431 --> 01:53:19,730
like,
Oh,

2932
01:53:19,730 --> 01:53:20,870
don't look to me,
I don't know nothing.

2933
01:53:20,871 --> 01:53:21,830
And I'm like,
I'm getting Outta here.

2934
01:53:22,130 --> 01:53:23,400
And he just runs away teach.

2935
01:53:23,440 --> 01:53:25,220
It should be so much bigger.
I mean,

2936
01:53:25,850 --> 01:53:28,730
I was talking to Mary Carey when we had
her on the podcast and he was talking,

2937
01:53:28,731 --> 01:53:30,590
she was talking about how she saw you in
Ra.

2938
01:53:30,591 --> 01:53:31,900
She's just like,
it's I,

2939
01:53:32,180 --> 01:53:33,350
what's that guy saying?
Ari Shaffir.

2940
01:53:33,351 --> 01:53:35,060
He was so fucking hilarious.
I'm like,

2941
01:53:35,061 --> 01:53:36,770
wow,
you knew his name offhand.

2942
01:53:36,800 --> 01:53:38,600
Well,
we talked to her for like five hours on

2943
01:53:38,601 --> 01:53:39,710
the plane too,
but yeah,

2944
01:53:39,711 --> 01:53:41,390
that she did remember his name.
Yeah.

2945
01:53:41,391 --> 01:53:41,990
Wayne,
look,

2946
01:53:41,990 --> 01:53:42,710
it's,
it's tea.

2947
01:53:42,710 --> 01:53:46,850
It's tough these days for a comic to get
notoriety just for their standup.

2948
01:53:46,880 --> 01:53:47,750
You know,
you have to,

2949
01:53:47,960 --> 01:53:49,970
you have to get on something where
people see you.

2950
01:53:49,971 --> 01:53:52,130
There's just so much entertainment
value.

2951
01:53:52,131 --> 01:53:53,420
You know,
you have to have a comedy central

2952
01:53:53,421 --> 01:53:55,790
special,
you have to have something and an Ra is

2953
01:53:55,791 --> 01:53:58,700
at a bit of a disadvantage just like
Joey is and that they're both roost,

2954
01:53:58,880 --> 01:54:00,730
ruthlessly dirty,
you know,

2955
01:54:00,750 --> 01:54:04,070
which is really hilarious,
but it's hard to clean that shit up for,

2956
01:54:04,220 --> 01:54:06,620
you know,
a seven minute spot at live at Gotham or

2957
01:54:06,621 --> 01:54:07,310
something like that.

2958
01:54:07,310 --> 01:54:09,500
You know,
it was always hard for me to,

2959
01:54:09,501 --> 01:54:11,660
when I,
when I first started out to clean it up

2960
01:54:11,661 --> 01:54:13,630
for like a 10 minute set or seven
minutes,

2961
01:54:14,480 --> 01:54:16,100
seven minutes,
that's our hard in the first place.

2962
01:54:16,101 --> 01:54:19,250
Cause it's like just getting a joke out.
It's like fuck you know,

2963
01:54:19,251 --> 01:54:20,600
you,
when you want to do a set,

2964
01:54:20,601 --> 01:54:22,190
you want to open up,
get their,

2965
01:54:22,220 --> 01:54:25,740
get their respect,
get some laughs and then slowly settle

2966
01:54:25,741 --> 01:54:29,060
into your view of things.
But you can't do that in 10 minutes,

2967
01:54:29,061 --> 01:54:31,370
man.
In 10 minutes you got to slam him with

2968
01:54:31,371 --> 01:54:33,170
some shit and then just get the fuck out
of there.

2969
01:54:33,500 --> 01:54:36,680
And you know that that's something that
Ari hasn't done yet.

2970
01:54:36,710 --> 01:54:38,930
He hasn't really,
really knocked one out of the park and

2971
01:54:38,931 --> 01:54:41,470
they've got a half an hour comedy
central special and then got an hour's

2972
01:54:41,510 --> 01:54:44,930
comedy central special.
And he doesn't do enough updating on his

2973
01:54:44,931 --> 01:54:45,590
website either.

2974
01:54:45,590 --> 01:54:46,423
He's,
I mean,

2975
01:54:46,550 --> 01:54:47,390
you know,
I was,

2976
01:54:48,140 --> 01:54:50,390
look,
I've had a website since 1998 and

2977
01:54:50,391 --> 01:54:52,700
there's thousands of blog entries,
you know,

2978
01:54:52,701 --> 01:54:53,960
I mean I,
and I'm a busy guy.

2979
01:54:53,961 --> 01:54:56,210
You've got to write things,
you've got to give people things like

2980
01:54:56,211 --> 01:54:57,080
Twitter,
look,

2981
01:54:57,081 --> 01:54:58,760
I write a lot of shit on Twitter is
like,

2982
01:54:58,761 --> 01:55:00,320
hey,
the podcast is about to start.

2983
01:55:00,321 --> 01:55:00,981
Or Hey,
you know,

2984
01:55:00,981 --> 01:55:02,420
I'm about to do this Gig,
or hey,

2985
01:55:02,421 --> 01:55:03,620
you know,
come see me here.

2986
01:55:03,860 --> 01:55:07,380
But a lot of the rest of it is just me
writing things that I think certain

2987
01:55:07,410 --> 01:55:10,280
think are funny and interesting or some
link that Sony sent me.

2988
01:55:10,281 --> 01:55:13,130
That's interesting.
I'm retweeting it and I want it

2989
01:55:13,131 --> 01:55:14,210
entertaining.
You know,

2990
01:55:14,211 --> 01:55:17,570
I want to make sure it's entertaining
and because it's a part of that whole

2991
01:55:17,571 --> 01:55:18,470
system of,
of,

2992
01:55:18,471 --> 01:55:21,110
of promoting yourself,
of getting yourself out there or being

2993
01:55:21,111 --> 01:55:24,350
of being able to work and Ari hasn't
really embraced that.

2994
01:55:24,530 --> 01:55:26,360
You know,
he embraced the Twitter better a little

2995
01:55:26,361 --> 01:55:28,040
bit.
He writes funny tweets every now and

2996
01:55:28,041 --> 01:55:30,080
then,
but he needs to be like real proactive

2997
01:55:30,081 --> 01:55:31,530
of like his website.
It's not,

2998
01:55:31,560 --> 01:55:34,940
he's got a wife and kids and a job and
an excuse to not be doing all this

2999
01:55:34,941 --> 01:55:35,774
stuff,
you know?

3000
01:55:35,810 --> 01:55:39,860
But at least he's doing his podcast on
your desk squad network and it's the

3001
01:55:39,861 --> 01:55:41,880
skeptic tank.
If you're looking for that's the army

3002
01:55:41,881 --> 01:55:43,830
calls it and it's really good.
And uh,

3003
01:55:43,860 --> 01:55:44,910
I've been on it.
Um,

3004
01:55:44,940 --> 01:55:46,200
may have,
Miller has been on it.

3005
01:55:46,201 --> 01:55:47,700
He had with Steve on his,

3006
01:55:47,860 --> 01:55:48,693
I know that was,
I was,

3007
01:55:50,020 --> 01:55:52,440
I may have,
if they're under desk squats is go on

3008
01:55:52,460 --> 01:55:54,850
iTunes and subscribe to test squad has
met res.

3009
01:55:54,851 --> 01:55:57,850
It has Sam Tripoli's podcast,
Tom Sigora who was on yesterday.

3010
01:55:57,851 --> 01:56:00,490
They're all grouped into one podcast.
And think about that man.

3011
01:56:00,491 --> 01:56:02,770
You would have never thought that you'd
be doing something like that.

3012
01:56:03,190 --> 01:56:05,220
Yeah,
I mean how crazy.

3013
01:56:05,560 --> 01:56:09,070
You know what's weird is the whole thing
is that when I was in middle school,

3014
01:56:09,071 --> 01:56:11,950
you had to or something like that.
High school freshman in high school you

3015
01:56:11,951 --> 01:56:14,920
had a shadow of the day job where you
pick what you wanted to be when you grew

3016
01:56:14,921 --> 01:56:19,450
up and you shadowed them for a day.
And so I shadowed air radio station

3017
01:56:19,451 --> 01:56:24,060
because I wanted to be a radio DJ and I
shattered the morning zoo and a Wnci in

3018
01:56:24,061 --> 01:56:26,650
97.9.
It was the day buster Douglas One and

3019
01:56:26,651 --> 01:56:28,900
they have buster Douglas on the,
on the radio station.

3020
01:56:28,900 --> 01:56:30,890
I think I've talked about this before
but time,

3021
01:56:31,560 --> 01:56:34,400
but it was crazy cause we actually,
Doug was knocked out Tyson.

3022
01:56:34,410 --> 01:56:35,350
Yeah.
And we were,

3023
01:56:35,351 --> 01:56:38,650
we were actually in Columbus,
Ohio like when we did your DVD special

3024
01:56:38,651 --> 01:56:42,100
and we are on that radio show and the
guy was still working as a Dj and I was

3025
01:56:42,101 --> 01:56:42,671
like,
you know what,

3026
01:56:42,671 --> 01:56:46,870
you were the guy that I,
when I was a kid that I hung out with

3027
01:56:46,871 --> 01:56:48,940
this guy all day,
took me to breakfast,

3028
01:56:48,941 --> 01:56:51,250
took me to lunch and now,
now look at this.

3029
01:56:51,251 --> 01:56:52,730
And it's like I'm an adult and you're
still here.

3030
01:56:56,830 --> 01:56:57,491
Yeah,
no,

3031
01:56:57,491 --> 01:56:58,760
it's uh,
it's,

3032
01:56:58,770 --> 01:57:01,300
it's interesting what,
what podcasting has become,

3033
01:57:01,490 --> 01:57:02,260
you know,
um,

3034
01:57:02,260 --> 01:57:03,550
Ariel Helwani,
uh,

3035
01:57:03,580 --> 01:57:05,530
and I,
I did his podcast yesterday and I did it

3036
01:57:05,531 --> 01:57:07,450
through Skype,
which is pretty bad ass.

3037
01:57:07,451 --> 01:57:10,510
I did a video of portion of it through
Skype and a,

3038
01:57:10,511 --> 01:57:13,540
I just use the microphone and listen to
the headsets and I'm like,

3039
01:57:13,541 --> 01:57:15,280
this is crazy.
And we're doing it in real time and it

3040
01:57:15,281 --> 01:57:16,260
sounds awesome.
Yeah,

3041
01:57:16,430 --> 01:57:18,670
it sounded really clear.
Sounded Great.

3042
01:57:18,730 --> 01:57:19,563
Yeah.
Cool.

3043
01:57:19,570 --> 01:57:20,231
You know,
you can,

3044
01:57:20,231 --> 01:57:21,670
uh,
it's a different world,

3045
01:57:21,671 --> 01:57:24,190
man.
We live in a different world and we got

3046
01:57:24,191 --> 01:57:27,130
lucky.
We snuck in right on the ground floor,

3047
01:57:27,160 --> 01:57:29,110
you know,
totally never expected that.

3048
01:57:29,111 --> 01:57:32,500
I remember all these other people were
doing podcasts at the time because I did

3049
01:57:32,501 --> 01:57:35,710
Adam Carolla's podcast way before I even
moved to Colorado.

3050
01:57:35,950 --> 01:57:37,000
You know,
I had done it,

3051
01:57:37,030 --> 01:57:38,770
you know,
and it's still hadn't done my own.

3052
01:57:38,830 --> 01:57:41,550
What's podcasts in general?
It's weird how they used to be popular

3053
01:57:41,560 --> 01:57:44,060
like four years ago.
Like when I first came out and the iPods

3054
01:57:44,210 --> 01:57:45,760
first came out and they were,
or whatever,

3055
01:57:45,761 --> 01:57:48,130
it was a huge or for,
oh no.

3056
01:57:48,480 --> 01:57:50,230
Huge,
huge ones back then.

3057
01:57:50,650 --> 01:57:55,010
I remember like Kevin Rose and all those
guys from tech TV had no bills.

3058
01:57:55,020 --> 01:57:56,170
He,
the guy started dig.

3059
01:57:56,350 --> 01:57:57,400
Yeah.
Same Guy.

3060
01:57:57,430 --> 01:57:58,390
Same Guy.
Kevin Rose.

3061
01:57:58,391 --> 01:57:59,440
Yeah.
Crazy bastards.

3062
01:57:59,540 --> 01:58:00,700
All him.
He's got some ideas.

3063
01:58:00,730 --> 01:58:03,190
Well now he's not with dig anymore and
everyone's pissed because they,

3064
01:58:03,480 --> 01:58:04,570
he pretty much,
he digs,

3065
01:58:04,660 --> 01:58:08,010
supposedly gone to shit since he left.
And then one's mad at him.

3066
01:58:08,020 --> 01:58:08,860
Like I said,
well that's a,

3067
01:58:08,940 --> 01:58:11,850
that's what I've heard.
I haven't been following still.

3068
01:58:11,851 --> 01:58:13,360
I use dig all the time.
I liked did good.

3069
01:58:13,430 --> 01:58:17,210
digg.com if you've never been is uh,
an excellent portal for interesting

3070
01:58:17,211 --> 01:58:18,020
stories.
Yeah.

3071
01:58:18,020 --> 01:58:20,270
There's always like,
I will scroll through the first four or

3072
01:58:20,271 --> 01:58:23,600
five pages and uh,
every time I do it,

3073
01:58:23,601 --> 01:58:25,130
you know,
there's always something interesting

3074
01:58:25,131 --> 01:58:27,200
that pops up.
That's where I got that Dilbert story.

3075
01:58:27,201 --> 01:58:29,330
And you know,
there's always Charlie Sheen asking for

3076
01:58:29,331 --> 01:58:30,470
custody of his twins.

3077
01:58:31,120 --> 01:58:33,400
Oh,
that's the fucking perfect thing to

3078
01:58:33,401 --> 01:58:37,180
happen right now at the end of the
podcast for this God damn phone to ring

3079
01:58:37,181 --> 01:58:38,230
because I never turned it off.

3080
01:58:45,490 --> 01:58:47,860
Malibu,
Malibu,

3081
01:58:47,861 --> 01:58:48,694
California.

3082
01:58:50,310 --> 01:58:51,550
All Right,
sorry ladies,

3083
01:58:51,580 --> 01:58:55,540
gentlemen for that sort of an inside
joke on this podcast and I'm a retard.

3084
01:58:55,541 --> 01:58:58,360
I never turned my fucking phone off.
The real problem is I'm always usually

3085
01:58:58,361 --> 01:59:00,220
on the phone right up until the time we
start.

3086
01:59:00,460 --> 01:59:02,380
And then there's a,
there's a bunch of them and their

3087
01:59:02,381 --> 01:59:03,280
cordless,
you know,

3088
01:59:03,281 --> 01:59:05,860
so they're all floating around.
I never know where the fuck they are.

3089
01:59:05,861 --> 01:59:07,720
And I usually just pull the plug out of
the wall.

3090
01:59:08,530 --> 01:59:12,490
I did it yesterday but actually plugged
it back in right before the show,

3091
01:59:12,780 --> 01:59:15,070
the show today,
cause I had to make a call.

3092
01:59:15,790 --> 01:59:17,770
You don't give a fuck.
And I wouldn't either.

3093
01:59:18,220 --> 01:59:20,680
The point is a,
we've done this for a hundred episodes

3094
01:59:20,681 --> 01:59:21,970
now.
Give me some knuckles.

3095
01:59:22,500 --> 01:59:24,330
We'd had a good time.
Red Band.

3096
01:59:24,331 --> 01:59:26,280
And I have uh,
we've,

3097
01:59:26,281 --> 01:59:27,690
uh,
more than,

3098
01:59:27,720 --> 01:59:29,370
uh,
surpassed our expectations.

3099
01:59:29,371 --> 01:59:31,740
I never had any going into it.
I don't think you did either.

3100
01:59:32,300 --> 01:59:34,460
Never thought it would be like this.
I thought this was actually going to

3101
01:59:34,461 --> 01:59:36,740
last a month.
I thought like you'd get sick of it in a

3102
01:59:36,740 --> 01:59:38,210
month.
And that's the craziest thing about

3103
01:59:38,211 --> 01:59:39,140
that,
that you still,

3104
01:59:39,440 --> 01:59:39,961
I,
you know,

3105
01:59:39,961 --> 01:59:41,180
you still do it,
you know?

3106
01:59:41,190 --> 01:59:42,440
Yeah,
I thought for sure.

3107
01:59:42,560 --> 01:59:43,150
I'm pretty good at

3108
01:59:43,150 --> 01:59:44,140
doing things.
Once I get,

3109
01:59:44,200 --> 01:59:46,360
once I get started,
I'm pretty good at sticking to him,

3110
01:59:46,750 --> 01:59:48,660
you know?
But it's uh,

3111
01:59:48,970 --> 01:59:52,000
the one I realized it was crazy when I
realized like weird things was happening

3112
01:59:52,150 --> 01:59:56,740
was when I asked the crowd in Boston,
I did the Wilbur theater packed,

3113
01:59:56,741 --> 01:59:59,590
sold out and I go,
how many in Eddie Bravo was there?

3114
01:59:59,620 --> 02:00:03,970
And I yelled out to Eddie Cause I had my
10th planet Jiu Jitsu shirt on and I was

3115
02:00:03,971 --> 02:00:05,510
like,
Chad planted in the house and then I,

3116
02:00:05,511 --> 02:00:07,330
and I yelled out how many guys listen to
the podcast?

3117
02:00:07,331 --> 02:00:11,290
And they went fucking crazy.
It was like 90% of the crowd.

3118
02:00:11,291 --> 02:00:12,071
And I was like,
Whoa,

3119
02:00:12,071 --> 02:00:13,390
really,
really?

3120
02:00:13,690 --> 02:00:15,630
And then I realized that I'm like
somewhere along the route,

3121
02:00:15,670 --> 02:00:18,070
maybe that's why these crowds have been
cooler lately.

3122
02:00:18,340 --> 02:00:22,570
Like over the last like six months,
the crowds have gotten noticeably cooler

3123
02:00:22,571 --> 02:00:23,650
and they were always cool.

3124
02:00:23,650 --> 02:00:25,600
There were always cool.
There was always a huge percentage of

3125
02:00:25,601 --> 02:00:27,250
cool people,
but there was always people that didn't

3126
02:00:27,251 --> 02:00:29,190
know what I was up to and they're just,
you know,

3127
02:00:29,470 --> 02:00:32,680
the fear factor or UFC or whatever.
Jamie Kennedy wasn't in town,

3128
02:00:32,681 --> 02:00:33,850
so they wanted to see me.
I know what I mean.

3129
02:00:33,851 --> 02:00:35,740
It's like they don't know what they're
doing and just wander in there.

3130
02:00:35,950 --> 02:00:37,030
But now it's,
uh,

3131
02:00:37,060 --> 02:00:39,100
it's a completely changed,
like in Philly,

3132
02:00:39,130 --> 02:00:41,770
the whole crowd,
it's all podcast fans because they find

3133
02:00:41,771 --> 02:00:43,720
out about the show long before everybody
else.

3134
02:00:43,930 --> 02:00:46,120
That show was sold out a month before we
were ever there,

3135
02:00:46,150 --> 02:00:46,780
you know?
I mean,

3136
02:00:46,780 --> 02:00:49,000
that's,
that's never happened to me before.

3137
02:00:49,030 --> 02:00:52,420
If the best case scenario was like the
last time I was in Philly,

3138
02:00:52,450 --> 02:00:56,290
which is like a year ago,
we sold it all out just before I got

3139
02:00:56,291 --> 02:00:58,450
there.
But this was sold out like way before

3140
02:00:58,451 --> 02:00:59,320
that,
you know,

3141
02:00:59,321 --> 02:01:00,220
so it's,
it's,

3142
02:01:00,820 --> 02:01:02,040
yeah,
I did an extra show.

3143
02:01:02,041 --> 02:01:04,650
You did more.
Shut the fuck up.

3144
02:01:05,010 --> 02:01:07,020
God Damn it.
Who is this again?

3145
02:01:07,170 --> 02:01:09,480
Same thing.
Hung up on me.

3146
02:01:10,170 --> 02:01:11,220
I'm don't give a fuck about them.

3147
02:01:11,350 --> 02:01:13,450
That's how I roll.
All Right Ladies and gentlemen.

3148
02:01:13,510 --> 02:01:14,710
Um,
at that note,

3149
02:01:15,010 --> 02:01:18,190
I apologize for the phone.
This won't happen after episode 100.

3150
02:01:18,410 --> 02:01:20,020
I'm going to,
I'm going to have that shit straightened

3151
02:01:20,021 --> 02:01:21,340
out.
I'm going to fix it.

3152
02:01:21,940 --> 02:01:24,070
Um,
we will be back next week.

3153
02:01:24,071 --> 02:01:25,750
As we said,
a Adam Corolla is on,

3154
02:01:25,751 --> 02:01:26,950
on Tuesday.
And,

3155
02:01:26,951 --> 02:01:29,200
um,

3156
02:01:29,230 --> 02:01:33,090

3157

3158
02:01:34,380 --> 02:01:36,110
Joey wants to come on next week too.
We don't,

3159
02:01:36,130 --> 02:01:39,230
we should have in Joey.
We haven't had that Combo it together a

3160
02:01:39,231 --> 02:01:40,100
while.
It's a good combo.

3161
02:01:40,160 --> 02:01:42,020
That's a good Combo,
ladies and gentlemen.

3162
02:01:42,021 --> 02:01:43,880
It's been an awesome 100 episodes.

3163
02:01:43,881 --> 02:01:45,200
uh,
