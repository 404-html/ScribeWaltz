1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,950
I like these five,

2
00:00:01,951 --> 00:00:02,761
four,

3
00:00:02,761 --> 00:00:03,630
three,

4
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:04,860
two.

5
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:06,810
Uno.

6
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:09,983
Yes.

7
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:11,230
Hey everybody.

8
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:12,063
I'm still out of breath.

9
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:12,870
Yeah.

10
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:13,180
Uh,

11
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:17,040
Brendan Schaub and Brian Callen
were engaged in some shenanigans.

12
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:18,480
They rough house Sunday.

13
00:00:18,481 --> 00:00:19,200
Rough House.

14
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,100
I was trying to chill.

15
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:20,650
I was talking,

16
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:21,361
I was poking the bear.

17
00:00:21,361 --> 00:00:21,661
I got,

18
00:00:21,661 --> 00:00:23,580
I had too much coffee and I went,

19
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:24,920
I went into,

20
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:27,210
I got into his face
and then he decided to,

21
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:30,900
Jamie's chose me and I'll
be on my Instagram story.

22
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:33,303
Double tap outs.

23
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:33,871
Yeah,

24
00:00:33,871 --> 00:00:34,704
that was not right.

25
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:35,580
You had a tap.

26
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,580
Well I got a fucking huge a rug
burn on my fucking forehead.

27
00:00:38,581 --> 00:00:39,620
Now that that's it.

28
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:40,380
That kind of,

29
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,910
well that's what happens.

30
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:42,211
What,

31
00:00:42,211 --> 00:00:44,880
what kind of Shit fucking
production is this?

32
00:00:44,881 --> 00:00:45,600
Look at this.

33
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,650
They got who's running?

34
00:00:46,651 --> 00:00:48,120
The camera's over there in England.

35
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:50,470
They showed niner in the background.

36
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:51,963
The fucking,

37
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:54,960
the curtain that's covering the monitors.

38
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,520
Whoever did that sucks.

39
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:57,840
This is what happens.

40
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,150
And the UFC got rid of all the old guys.

41
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,760
Now you got new guys over there in
England to or wherever the fuck home.

42
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:05,863
You know.

43
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:09,960
So Eddie Bravo can't be here folks cause
he's on the other side of the world

44
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,210
where Flatworld that shit is ironic.

45
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:12,880
The flat,

46
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,713
the flat world.

47
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,501
Where is he right now?

48
00:01:14,501 --> 00:01:17,070
Ticking necessarily
says the earth is flat.

49
00:01:17,071 --> 00:01:18,210
He's never necessarily set it.

50
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,010
He just says things like,

51
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,480
I don't know Bro.

52
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:22,200
Take a look at it.

53
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,033
When you look into it.

54
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,280
I'm not saying it's round.

55
00:01:26,281 --> 00:01:27,330
I'm not saying it's flat.

56
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:32,010
What's amazing though is the angry flat
earth people when even post something

57
00:01:32,011 --> 00:01:32,460
like that.

58
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,260
Oh my God,

59
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,650
they get so mad.

60
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,660
But don't you think you're
being trolled for the most part?

61
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,680
No.

62
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:38,280
Really.

63
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,410
I think people are that fucking stupid.

64
00:01:40,411 --> 00:01:42,450
I think there's a bunch
of meth babies out there.

65
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:46,410
I think there's a bunch of dummies who
were eating nothing but sugar and they

66
00:01:46,411 --> 00:01:48,990
had kids and these kids
are stupid as fuck.

67
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:51,271
That's fair.

68
00:01:51,271 --> 00:01:51,950
It might be true.

69
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:52,783
That's fair.

70
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,780
I think there's like a few trolling,

71
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:55,960
but in general the,

72
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,960
the math of those morons,

73
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:58,620
they believe,

74
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:03,300
well a lot of people just don't have any
idea of any kind of tradition of where

75
00:02:03,301 --> 00:02:04,500
we came to these conclusions.

76
00:02:04,501 --> 00:02:07,410
So they think that history
starting right now with them?

77
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:08,640
Well,

78
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,330
you know what I mean,

79
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,800
there's a lot of laziness is a lot and
there's also a lot of confirmation bias.

80
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,170
They have these ideas in their
head and they don't look into them.

81
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,360
They're just not interested in like,

82
00:02:18,361 --> 00:02:19,050
uh,

83
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:20,130
really getting into it.

84
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:20,581
Well,

85
00:02:20,581 --> 00:02:20,851
you know,

86
00:02:20,851 --> 00:02:21,810
like listening to that,

87
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,070
that debate with Michael Shermer and
Randall Carlson and Graham Hancock,

88
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,080
like if you as a scientist
and smart people,

89
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:32,190
they're very careful about what they
say because they get called out on it.

90
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:32,640
Sure.

91
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,271
You know what I mean?

92
00:02:33,271 --> 00:02:37,350
And and arriving at real conclusions
is something they tend to avoid.

93
00:02:37,351 --> 00:02:41,430
They'll just have these big discussions
and kind of approximate what probably

94
00:02:41,431 --> 00:02:41,880
happened.

95
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,061
Yeah.

96
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:43,530
And even in that discussion,

97
00:02:43,531 --> 00:02:48,120
you got to see people that
got into trouble for saying
something didn't happen.

98
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:52,020
And so then as Randall started unveiling
more evidence and Graham started

99
00:02:52,021 --> 00:02:53,040
unveiling more evidence,

100
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:55,350
it was one of those things where
everybody kind of had it back up and go,

101
00:02:55,351 --> 00:02:56,160
okay,

102
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,040
well you can't say it didn't happen
because of all this stuff that we know did

103
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:00,760
happen now.

104
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,890
And so it's,

105
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:05,320
it's very complicated when you start
saying you know things and when you know

106
00:03:05,321 --> 00:03:10,321
almost nothing about science and space
and astrophysics and all the different

107
00:03:10,421 --> 00:03:14,830
shit that you need to know to
understand satellites and ice walls.

108
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:15,700
Shit.

109
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,370
How about the way our
mind works like that?

110
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,520
Tobolowsky what's his name?

111
00:03:18,521 --> 00:03:22,120
Who I just listened to podcasts so I
listened to a couple of his lectures back

112
00:03:22,121 --> 00:03:22,720
in the day on,

113
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,350
on ted.com but like when he was talking
about all the variables that lend

114
00:03:26,351 --> 00:03:31,300
themselves to how your brain works and
who you are and good luck getting to a

115
00:03:31,301 --> 00:03:31,930
conclusion.

116
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:35,560
He says staunched determinism believe
will not even though I shouldn't say a

117
00:03:35,561 --> 00:03:37,030
believer because he's a scientist,

118
00:03:37,031 --> 00:03:38,410
but what his conclusion,

119
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,980
I mean what he's trying to establish
with people is that there's so many

120
00:03:41,981 --> 00:03:45,070
variables that go into
you being you biological,

121
00:03:45,071 --> 00:03:46,600
very illogical variables,

122
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,980
genetic variables,

123
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:52,090
variables in terms of like what genes are
turned on by stress when your mother's

124
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,370
has you in the womb.

125
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,070
Yeah.

126
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:56,410
There's so much shit that
goes into you being a person.

127
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:56,951
And so,

128
00:03:56,951 --> 00:04:01,510
you know what he's saying is that like
when we look back on today and we look

129
00:04:01,511 --> 00:04:04,140
back at people being punished for
certain things that they did and be an

130
00:04:04,141 --> 00:04:04,830
imprisoned,

131
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:09,830
we're going to think it's
absolutely barbaric when
when real neurologists firmly

132
00:04:09,881 --> 00:04:12,730
established the actual
science behind human behavior.

133
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:17,590
I mean meaning that we don't really
have free will where w w our behavior is

134
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:19,690
dictated by our biology and our machine.

135
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,320
Right?

136
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:20,561
Yeah.

137
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:25,561
I mean there's gotta be some will because
why else are they're inspirational

138
00:04:25,661 --> 00:04:27,700
memes that strippers put
on their Instagram page.

139
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,530
This has gotta be

140
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:33,290
shy to rise

141
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:39,170
above the try and,

142
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,930
and you can't get inspired,

143
00:04:40,931 --> 00:04:41,320
right?

144
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:41,680
Yes.

145
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,240
Like we see this is where the freewill
argument kind of hits a bump in the road

146
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:50,680
because you can get inspired by shit and
when you do and get inspired by Shitty

147
00:04:50,681 --> 00:04:52,390
can improve your life for how long though,

148
00:04:52,391 --> 00:04:52,690
right?

149
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:52,900
Yeah.

150
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:53,920
Well it depends.

151
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,260
They both seem changes.

152
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:58,030
What's that old expression is
that inspiration is like bathing.

153
00:04:58,031 --> 00:04:58,691
It's effective,

154
00:04:58,691 --> 00:04:59,710
but you need to do it daily.

155
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:00,420
Yeah.

156
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,030
Yeah.

157
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:05,530
Or how about the fact that punishment but
got to read a little bit every now and

158
00:05:05,531 --> 00:05:05,900
then.

159
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,330
Punish my doesn't know.

160
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:09,680
I mean that's some old school shit.

161
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,440
I just dropped my tattoo.

162
00:05:11,441 --> 00:05:12,460
I'm getting that as a tattoo

163
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,533
on my dog.

164
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,400
That's a bold move guys.

165
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,390
Who Tattoo Their Dick

166
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:24,160
for a tab or would you
like what would you do?

167
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,600
We should tell you to your Dick Black.

168
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,310
Just all black.

169
00:05:27,311 --> 00:05:28,420
Just a black band.

170
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:29,740
Black people do that.

171
00:05:29,741 --> 00:05:31,030
They get like their whole arm black.

172
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:31,720
That's a weird,

173
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,080
I wonder why I thought it was cause they
messed up and then God better to cover

174
00:05:35,081 --> 00:05:35,651
everything.

175
00:05:35,651 --> 00:05:36,251
Go Black.

176
00:05:36,251 --> 00:05:39,970
But no for some people they do do it for
that and some people do it because they

177
00:05:39,971 --> 00:05:41,530
just want their whole arm to be black.

178
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:42,310
Yeah.

179
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:45,790
Some people have bands can look good
and then there are people that just get

180
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:49,750
random shit like a Cadillac or a doll.

181
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:50,830
Well how about Travis Barker?

182
00:05:50,831 --> 00:05:51,640
He's got everything.

183
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,061
You name it,

184
00:05:52,061 --> 00:05:52,511
he's got it.

185
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:52,871
It's all right.

186
00:05:52,871 --> 00:05:53,020
Yeah,

187
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,240
I got that tactic just
to doodle pad a tattoo.

188
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,093
The Cadillac tax.

189
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,040
He has a guy

190
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,521
is guy,

191
00:05:58,521 --> 00:06:00,830
a things guys cartoon and
I forget the guy's name,

192
00:06:00,831 --> 00:06:02,840
but he'll have two of them
worked on at the same time.

193
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:06,080
Jesus Christ both on his back
just doing work dudes like that,

194
00:06:06,081 --> 00:06:07,640
like run out of cannabis,

195
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:11,240
like he's kind of running
out of canvas space.

196
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,620
I didn't know his whole head is done.

197
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,140
Jesus taught us this whole
head is done but a lot.

198
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:16,300
I mean he's had a lot of those tattoos.

199
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:19,400
We remembered he got on that plane crash
and he had like third degree burns all

200
00:06:19,401 --> 00:06:20,234
over his body.

201
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:23,890
I remember he got a lot
of them after that cover.

202
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:24,853
Kind of that bullshit.

203
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:26,320
Fucking crazy.

204
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,350
He's same man.

205
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:32,060
He survives that Guy Dj am and then the
guy kills himself afterwards when he was

206
00:06:32,061 --> 00:06:34,640
really fucked up right
after on these drugs.

207
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:38,210
I use a little fine before then and then
goes to the hospital and then you know

208
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,470
you're on the medication.

209
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:40,303
The neighborhood labs.

210
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:45,140
I know a woman who got injured
like that and then she was,

211
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,940
they put her on morphine and she has to
basically battle a morphine addiction

212
00:06:49,941 --> 00:06:50,774
the rest of her life.

213
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:51,561
She said,

214
00:06:51,561 --> 00:06:53,660
I will always be addicted to opiates.

215
00:06:53,661 --> 00:06:54,720
I'll always want it.

216
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:55,461
Don't have to be,

217
00:06:55,461 --> 00:06:55,910
but yeah.

218
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:56,211
Well No,

219
00:06:56,211 --> 00:06:57,860
I'm saying she's got
that urge all the time.

220
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:00,410
But you got that urge when
you had your nose fixed,

221
00:07:00,411 --> 00:07:01,244
right?

222
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,600
Yadda issue.

223
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,500
But what's it like a,

224
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:05,990
you just want them all the time.

225
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,520
Like what is it like
when you say you want,

226
00:07:07,521 --> 00:07:07,731
I'm like,

227
00:07:07,731 --> 00:07:08,810
what's the feeling like?

228
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:12,230
Like the same feeling as like a,

229
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:13,940
I don't like if you crave something,

230
00:07:13,941 --> 00:07:14,920
like you're constantly craving it.

231
00:07:14,921 --> 00:07:15,700
And I got it.

232
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,610
I'm good right now.

233
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:18,770
I'd be so much better than Oxycontin,

234
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:19,310
you know?

235
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,143
Wow.

236
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,200
Like this.

237
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,660
Or We'd be going out like
it's going to be fun.

238
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,030
It'd be so much fun if I
said one oxycotton though.

239
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,470
Wow.

240
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,360
And they just start doing like,

241
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:28,791
and you're like,

242
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:29,061
damn,

243
00:07:29,061 --> 00:07:30,830
I'm doing this for everything.

244
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,400
You were just oxy and up on the nonstop.

245
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,270
Wow.

246
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:38,180
And they're so easy to get Jesus Christ.

247
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:41,000
So no one ever questioned you when you
wanted to get a refill or anything like

248
00:07:41,001 --> 00:07:41,540
that?

249
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,021
No,

250
00:07:42,021 --> 00:07:43,070
because the doctor was like,

251
00:07:43,071 --> 00:07:43,581
Hey,

252
00:07:43,581 --> 00:07:44,091
I'm hip,

253
00:07:44,091 --> 00:07:44,571
I'm cool.

254
00:07:44,571 --> 00:07:46,190
Here's like 300.

255
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:46,461
You know,

256
00:07:46,461 --> 00:07:47,294
like a shitload.

257
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,640
He liked you cause you're a UFC guy.

258
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:50,540
Yeah we were boys.

259
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:50,900
Yeah.

260
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:51,733
Oh boy.

261
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:54,800
Jesus Christ.

262
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:56,390
Did you ever tell him hey fuck face.

263
00:07:56,391 --> 00:07:57,950
He kind of turned me into an addict.

264
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:58,371
No,

265
00:07:58,371 --> 00:07:59,630
I kind of blame myself.

266
00:07:59,660 --> 00:07:59,961
Yeah.

267
00:07:59,961 --> 00:08:00,620
Well that's good.

268
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,290
That's healthy of you.

269
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:03,770
That was like smashing machine
when they went to do that.

270
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:05,900
That a thing that Mark Kirk.

271
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:06,680
Oh yeah,

272
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,580
they didn't expect,

273
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:07,941
uh,

274
00:08:07,941 --> 00:08:08,780
I know the guys who made it,

275
00:08:08,781 --> 00:08:10,550
they didn't extend it and know
it was going to take that turn.

276
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:15,710
Well they went to get him like right when
the water went over the top like right

277
00:08:15,711 --> 00:08:17,000
when he crested over the top.

278
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,700
That's the documentary I'm working on.

279
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,260
I've never seen.

280
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,093
It's really good.

281
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,230
It's really good.

282
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:22,610
Cause they went to,

283
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:26,960
they went to document the greatest
fighter on earth cause car was this just

284
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,160
juice machine?

285
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:30,320
How long ago was this made shit man?

286
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:31,840
Early two thousands.

287
00:08:31,841 --> 00:08:32,120
Yeah.

288
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,571
So mark,

289
00:08:32,571 --> 00:08:35,390
mark and house on 88 it was actually,

290
00:08:35,391 --> 00:08:40,220
I think it might've been
because I remember you and
I talking to him in 1997 and

291
00:08:40,221 --> 00:08:42,140
he was to 60 he had just,

292
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:44,930
he just need that ranger in the face.

293
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:45,781
Rancher.

294
00:08:45,781 --> 00:08:46,250
Stott.

295
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:46,580
Yup.

296
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,510
And then I said,

297
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:47,861
I said,

298
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:48,111
I said,

299
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:49,280
you wrestled at one 88.

300
00:08:49,281 --> 00:08:49,550
He said,

301
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:49,941
yeah.

302
00:08:49,941 --> 00:08:50,151
I said,

303
00:08:50,151 --> 00:08:51,440
what are you wait nine to six.

304
00:08:51,441 --> 00:08:53,630
He put a little miracle grow
in my cereal every morning.

305
00:08:53,631 --> 00:08:54,200
And I was like,

306
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,710
God damn his steroids.

307
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:56,850
Good on him.

308
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:57,590
Steroids.

309
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:59,070
They looked amazing on him.

310
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,410
He uh,

311
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,800
he's gay too or no?

312
00:09:01,801 --> 00:09:02,850
Is that like you don't know?

313
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:03,630
Well,

314
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:04,170
I dunno.

315
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:04,820
I hope so.

316
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:05,071
I know.

317
00:09:05,071 --> 00:09:07,530
It's a wonderful man.

318
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,580
A really nice man.

319
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:10,110
I hope he's gay.

320
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,700
What's going on here?

321
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:12,960
So who are these gentleman?

322
00:09:12,961 --> 00:09:15,510
The guy with the writing on his
arm or Hermann for 30 right now,

323
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,720
son Hermanson and Nicholson and the
four 20 84274206425 in round one.

324
00:09:22,981 --> 00:09:23,850
If you want to sync up,

325
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,090
you look at the fighters on this card
and it's a fucking good luck with this

326
00:09:27,091 --> 00:09:27,421
spelling,

327
00:09:27,421 --> 00:09:29,640
but to get them back then Jesus Christ,

328
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:33,810
just those shelters dealt so big.

329
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:34,703
Oh my God.

330
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,660
And he'd made her American.

331
00:09:36,661 --> 00:09:38,340
He'd wear American flag shorts.

332
00:09:38,341 --> 00:09:39,780
That amazing.

333
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:40,321
Yeah,

334
00:09:40,321 --> 00:09:41,154
he was,

335
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,580
oh yeah.

336
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:44,100
They called him the specimen,

337
00:09:44,101 --> 00:09:44,760
right.

338
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,390
Will they fart?

339
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:48,080
They started out calling the specimen
then they call it the started calling the

340
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:51,660
smashing machine when he fought,

341
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,940
I forget who he follows.

342
00:09:52,941 --> 00:09:54,780
Damn globish Dan Boba.

343
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:59,730
She got Dan Bowbridge down and he
submitted him by shoving his chin in his

344
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:04,560
eyeball that he'd put his chin in his
eye socket and just grabbed the back of

345
00:10:04,561 --> 00:10:05,360
his neck.

346
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,060
Blumkin forced his chin was
eyeball head move of all time.

347
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:09,541
All time.

348
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:10,170
It's up there.

349
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:11,050
It's a great meeting.

350
00:10:11,051 --> 00:10:13,620
She'll meet head movement and you
need to do that kind of a move.

351
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:15,790
I mean I know it's a move for a shirt,

352
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,200
some meat hedge,

353
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:18,940
but it's a move beam.

354
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:22,590
Is it more of a meathead moved in the can
opener cause he submitted a guy with a

355
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,460
can opener too.

356
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,380
I feel like they can't open
a little more technical.

357
00:10:25,381 --> 00:10:27,090
He Jackson Dude's neck with a candle.

358
00:10:27,091 --> 00:10:28,020
But how has it more technical?

359
00:10:28,021 --> 00:10:30,810
You just pull on a guy's head
but you got to get them position.

360
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,390
I mean for you if you're
just doing like fuck it.

361
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,830
Shinda I Chen the eyeballs.

362
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:38,280
No techniques like my more to that recall.

363
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:41,610
That's actually more tactical that
a can opener or is it more barbaric?

364
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:43,050
It's more about Baird for sure,

365
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,750
but I mean I guess that would be,

366
00:10:45,751 --> 00:10:50,751
well that's fights over I guess this
Dude Jack Ma Hammered Jack in mine.

367
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:56,450
I guess the big issue with a 12 to six
eyeballs would be if a guy was down and

368
00:10:56,671 --> 00:10:59,640
you crush it right into the eyeball.

369
00:10:59,670 --> 00:10:59,791
Yeah.

370
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:01,560
This is more like a steamroll approach,

371
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:04,020
which just real slow mush.

372
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:05,363
I don't,

373
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:07,200
it bothers me that I
can't do that to a man.

374
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,580
What are we looking at up there,

375
00:11:08,581 --> 00:11:09,240
Jim?

376
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:09,820
Oh sorry.

377
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:10,860
I thought we thought you're
showing us something.

378
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,230
I'm going to work on that technique.

379
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,430
You couldn't do that to a man?

380
00:11:14,431 --> 00:11:15,090
Is that what you're saying?

381
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:15,361
I mean,

382
00:11:15,361 --> 00:11:15,661
you know,

383
00:11:15,661 --> 00:11:19,170
I just kind of could a smaller
guy and I'm fresh off my wound.

384
00:11:19,171 --> 00:11:19,330
I,

385
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:20,470
my head still hurts from you.

386
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:24,090
You fucking hurting Josh Martin on
the ground and stuck your Chin in his

387
00:11:24,091 --> 00:11:24,441
eyeball.

388
00:11:24,441 --> 00:11:25,274
I think you get some them.

389
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,970
There are guys that got them into this,

390
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,910
which was a comedian.

391
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:31,080
Oh yeah,

392
00:11:31,081 --> 00:11:32,490
there are certain communities
I can do that too.

393
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,090
Yeah.

394
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:34,500
I feel like it's all a pecking order,

395
00:11:34,501 --> 00:11:34,920
isn't it?

396
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,690
To Jay Davis might give you a hard time.

397
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:37,531
Remember when,

398
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:38,364
uh,

399
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:39,460
uh,

400
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,770
Ballantine's uh,

401
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:41,640
over,

402
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,100
remember when he got the
can opener on Ray Sefo.

403
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:44,940
You remember that?

404
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:45,510
Yeah.

405
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:46,590
Super old school.

406
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,850
Did he submit it with that?

407
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:48,540
Oh yeah.

408
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:48,850
Oh,

409
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:49,260
I'm pretty,

410
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,600
I'm pretty sure it was
out of sight control.

411
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,980
Valentine Overeem submitted,

412
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:54,220
ran to go tour with [inaudible]

413
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,271
old school.

414
00:11:55,271 --> 00:11:56,260
Old School.

415
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:56,860
Yeah.

416
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,330
He just didn't have it like the rain.

417
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:58,930
No.

418
00:11:58,930 --> 00:11:59,081
Well,

419
00:11:59,081 --> 00:12:00,450
he would fall apart when the,

420
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,090
when the bombs started dropping,

421
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,760
when the going got tough.

422
00:12:03,761 --> 00:12:04,001
He was like,

423
00:12:04,001 --> 00:12:04,301
you know what,

424
00:12:04,301 --> 00:12:05,230
fuck this check please.

425
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:06,360
When you,

426
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,090
when you're,

427
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:07,590
when you're ready.

428
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:08,410
CFO who didn't,

429
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:09,400
he was more of a striker,

430
00:12:09,401 --> 00:12:10,234
wasn't he?

431
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:10,840
Yeah,

432
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,673
to say the least.

433
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:12,941
So for him,

434
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:15,610
I guess getting caught in a can opener
just as a function of just like,

435
00:12:15,611 --> 00:12:17,950
you wouldn't get a high
level Jujitsu and can opener,

436
00:12:17,951 --> 00:12:18,251
would you?

437
00:12:18,251 --> 00:12:18,820
Or would you?

438
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:22,630
There's no situation that's super gorilla.

439
00:12:22,631 --> 00:12:26,020
Like Mark Kirk could get a
good black belt in one if like,

440
00:12:26,021 --> 00:12:26,854
he just could.

441
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:28,820
The guy just could not
get out and exhausted.

442
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:30,520
And if mark gets a hold of your neck,

443
00:12:30,521 --> 00:12:32,890
like he just can't rip
your ligaments apart,

444
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:34,900
your tendons and ligaments.

445
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:37,240
Back then he was so gorilla strong.

446
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:37,421
I mean,

447
00:12:37,421 --> 00:12:38,620
it didn't even make any sense.

448
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:39,130
Yeah.

449
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:40,060
He was so stupid.

450
00:12:40,061 --> 00:12:40,540
Strong.

451
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,321
And you're not used to it.

452
00:12:41,321 --> 00:12:42,250
Like if it caught you off guard,

453
00:12:42,251 --> 00:12:43,180
like I had Brian,

454
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:43,900
uh,

455
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:44,591
a waterman,

456
00:12:44,591 --> 00:12:49,591
Ron Waterman take literally take my
face and smash it between his tits and I

457
00:12:50,171 --> 00:12:51,004
have to tap out,

458
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,533
you know,

459
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,100
huge jazz shoes.

460
00:12:57,101 --> 00:12:57,760
All Tan.

461
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,760
Literally took his tissue,

462
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,550
smashed my face,

463
00:13:00,551 --> 00:13:01,660
cro cop fucked him up.

464
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,150
That was one of the
soccer kicked him in the,

465
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:03,730
yeah,

466
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:08,730
that was one of the first like cro cop
becoming cro cop fights when cro cop will

467
00:13:09,461 --> 00:13:12,640
started learning take down defense
motherfuckers got terrified.

468
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:13,503
Oh my God.

469
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:14,490
Oh my God,

470
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,330
that Guy Shitty fucked in with my nose.

471
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,620
Do you know what's funny is when you see

472
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,160
it was so embarrassing and Shane goes,

473
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:24,710
Shane,

474
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:24,850
Carmen it,

475
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:27,880
it's just three of us in the
room and chank Olga's dam

476
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,153
and I go,

477
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,380
have you ever tapped that?

478
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,213
Ego's

479
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:34,750
not like that.

480
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:38,080
You're looking for some kind of comradery
and it was just dead silence and I was

481
00:13:38,081 --> 00:13:39,550
just this pussy of the day.

482
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,370
Maybe come back next week.

483
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:46,060
Do you know what's funny is when a guys
who've never had any combat experience,

484
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:47,140
especially with wrestling,

485
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:50,230
get caught up with a guy
who has experienced so,

486
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:54,050
but dove had never had any
wrestling and he grabbed onto may,

487
00:13:54,051 --> 00:13:57,100
him Miller and Jason
was kind of showing him,

488
00:13:57,101 --> 00:13:57,611
just hit my,

489
00:13:57,611 --> 00:13:57,851
you know,

490
00:13:57,851 --> 00:13:59,440
it's like we're all on a wood floor.

491
00:13:59,441 --> 00:14:02,840
And Jason started showing him just a
couple of things where Doug was grabbing

492
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:03,490
him and stuff.

493
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:05,200
And dove was so kind of,

494
00:14:05,201 --> 00:14:07,540
and he's boxed so he knows
the difference with striking.

495
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:10,630
But he called me up the next day and he
said it's very difficult for me to get

496
00:14:10,631 --> 00:14:11,650
my head around this.

497
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:15,940
I said what he said to be that
dominated by another man that easily,

498
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,950
and to realize that I
could just be as dove,

499
00:14:17,951 --> 00:14:19,120
have a mirror in his house.

500
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:21,940
He knows better,

501
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,133
he knows better,

502
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:23,681
he knows better,

503
00:14:23,681 --> 00:14:23,880
but he's,

504
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,470
he's not a bad boxer for
an actor or a comedian.

505
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:27,710
He knows better.

506
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,310
Yeah.

507
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:31,320
But there doing black belts,

508
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,530
she'll be honest about
what's going on though,

509
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,250
have dumbbells punch in the face.

510
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:37,260
Dub is a good boxer.

511
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:37,871
Luck with that.

512
00:14:37,871 --> 00:14:40,000
He spars a lot with dove.

513
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:42,460
Dove is not a bad box for a Mac man,

514
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:44,230
especially at this price,

515
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,810
especially at his prime.

516
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,680
May hand was a monster man
was a bad mother fucker,

517
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:50,760
you know,

518
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:55,760
like I really feel like mayhem just
took too much punishment and his career.

519
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:57,110
And I think,

520
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:57,440
you know,

521
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,280
he also had some,

522
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:01,820
some obvious deep mental
health issues and demons.

523
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,473
Yeah.

524
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:03,780
Yeah.

525
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:04,401
He a rough,

526
00:15:04,401 --> 00:15:05,061
rough upbringing.

527
00:15:05,061 --> 00:15:05,680
I just think,

528
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,160
yeah,

529
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:06,993
I like my hand.

530
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:09,401
All those,

531
00:15:09,401 --> 00:15:11,840
those weird things you can't control.

532
00:15:11,841 --> 00:15:15,620
I think that all of that accumulated on
him and then 100% brain trauma may be

533
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,940
100% brain trauma.

534
00:15:16,941 --> 00:15:17,121
Man,

535
00:15:17,121 --> 00:15:18,820
that Bisping fight was a motherfucker.

536
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:19,251
Dude.

537
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,620
Bisping beat the shit out
of him before that though,

538
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:22,161
cause gambling,

539
00:15:22,161 --> 00:15:24,490
that's really going into
that fight like that wasn't,

540
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,080
I've never seen mayhem fight like
that before he even took a punch.

541
00:15:27,081 --> 00:15:27,351
I was like,

542
00:15:27,351 --> 00:15:28,610
what the fuck is he doing?

543
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:28,911
Well,

544
00:15:28,911 --> 00:15:32,480
that was a big fight for him because
that was one of the first fights we had a

545
00:15:32,481 --> 00:15:36,170
lot to lose because he was on the ultimate
fighter coaching against Bisping and

546
00:15:36,171 --> 00:15:37,004
the ultimate fighter.

547
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:37,611
He ain't had.

548
00:15:37,611 --> 00:15:41,270
See if you could pull up Mark Carr
submitting Dan Bovis where the Chin to the

549
00:15:41,271 --> 00:15:41,900
eyeball.

550
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,740
I'd love to see that.

551
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:43,820
I was there for that one.

552
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:44,841
Yeah,

553
00:15:44,841 --> 00:15:49,190
that was like 97 that was the early
days of the UFC and I remember thinking,

554
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,600
Oh shit,

555
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,190
do you remember that dude?

556
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:52,371
When,

557
00:15:52,371 --> 00:15:55,190
when they would have it in a parking lot
somewhere and I would always come with

558
00:15:55,191 --> 00:15:57,830
you and we just sit there and
it was just such a different,

559
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:01,520
well we were in Louisiana once you,

560
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:04,040
me and Ricky rocket and Eddie Bravo.

561
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:04,490
Yeah.

562
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:06,410
Ricky rocket was taking Gj recovery.

563
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:06,790
Ricky,

564
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,600
Ricky like legit black belt.

565
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,380
I'm really shadows,

566
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,510
legit black belt like roles.

567
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:12,680
He's very good.

568
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:13,650
And uh,

569
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:17,020
I know you're like skeptical
Hipaa face with them,

570
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:18,831
but uh,

571
00:16:18,831 --> 00:16:22,490
we were all in like Fox somewhere
in Louisiana or some shit.

572
00:16:22,491 --> 00:16:23,060
Right?

573
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,950
Where the hell were at Baton Rouge Rouge,

574
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:26,060
I think it was something like that.

575
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,090
Meeting you at the airport and just like,

576
00:16:29,091 --> 00:16:29,924
let's go.

577
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,600
And I would just be walking
around with these guys.

578
00:16:32,601 --> 00:16:35,390
It's just children who
are just fans of the time.

579
00:16:35,391 --> 00:16:36,021
You weren't working,

580
00:16:36,021 --> 00:16:36,854
it was working.

581
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:38,960
We were doing the post fight interviews.

582
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,530
John [inaudible] seven.

583
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,260
God Damn Dude,

584
00:16:42,261 --> 00:16:45,940
I've been in the late Joe and I admit,

585
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:49,820
I remember you and I walking
like I like little school boys.

586
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,820
Randy couture was sitting
there being interviewed.

587
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:53,310
I,

588
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:55,970
I remember the show well and
you and I kind of added up.

589
00:16:55,971 --> 00:17:00,740
We kind of like stood at a little bit
of a distance and just stared at him and

590
00:17:00,741 --> 00:17:00,871
I,

591
00:17:00,871 --> 00:17:01,820
and of course you know me,

592
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:02,654
I was like to her,

593
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:03,101
I was like,

594
00:17:03,101 --> 00:17:03,861
what did his shoulders,

595
00:17:03,861 --> 00:17:04,691
he doesn't look that big.

596
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:05,000
His arms,

597
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,460
his leg looked at his leg and
he had a ball boy on his knees.

598
00:17:07,461 --> 00:17:08,360
Like late isn't that big?

599
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,820
And we're just like looking
at what a bad ass he was.

600
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:13,350
Just this body forged speakers.

601
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,790
Nice Hallway.

602
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,400
You guys are around next weekend.

603
00:17:16,401 --> 00:17:17,340
Are you for this?

604
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:18,710
I leave Sunday night.

605
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:21,320
Sunday,

606
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,100
Saturday night for Australia.

607
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,480
So Saturday night we could do,

608
00:17:23,481 --> 00:17:24,710
if I companion for this,

609
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:26,270
that's a big fucking cock.

610
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:27,961
Oh No,

611
00:17:27,961 --> 00:17:28,050
no,

612
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:28,161
no.

613
00:17:28,161 --> 00:17:28,491
You know what?

614
00:17:28,491 --> 00:17:29,230
I'm going to be in that.

615
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:29,360
Wait,

616
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:29,931
what is that?

617
00:17:29,931 --> 00:17:31,850
Because I'm going to be an
Irvine to third and eighth.

618
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:32,091
Oh,

619
00:17:32,091 --> 00:17:32,750
I'll be here.

620
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,290
Yeah.

621
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:33,860
Yeah.

622
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:34,693
Dude.

623
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:36,650
June 8th night everybody come see me.

624
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,030
This is a legit fight.

625
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:38,751
Oh my God.

626
00:17:38,751 --> 00:17:40,000
Is it is a legit facts.

627
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:41,780
Holloway has a legit chance.

628
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,520
I think Mex wins.

629
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,253
You think so?

630
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:45,730
Yeah.

631
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:46,940
I like maths in this fight.

632
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,290
Wow.

633
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,183
I don't like that.

634
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:49,740
You know.

635
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,840
I don't know why he's
not getting more respect.

636
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,720
I don't Max.

637
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,220
Yeah,

638
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,760
he's a fucking killer.

639
00:17:54,761 --> 00:17:56,070
She's getting a ton of respect.

640
00:17:56,071 --> 00:17:57,060
You don't think Max gets it?

641
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:58,230
A lot of our spa,

642
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:00,000
not like he should or the press.

643
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:03,430
I liked the fact that he's willing to
fight him in fucking Rio to man the

644
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,260
doesn't care.

645
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,340
He doesn't give a full book.

646
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:08,790
Talk about just an
incredible champion though.

647
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:09,570
All know.

648
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:10,500
Well you know what man,

649
00:18:10,501 --> 00:18:15,420
all those legacy in his reign is always
going to be tarnished by that 13 seconds

650
00:18:15,421 --> 00:18:16,081
against Mcgregor,

651
00:18:16,081 --> 00:18:19,920
which is so crazy and a bit cause you
take away that fight and he's got one

652
00:18:19,921 --> 00:18:23,250
brutal war with Chad Mendez
where he got rocked and stunned,

653
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,290
which is a tough fight
to him about part two.

654
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:25,741
Yeah.

655
00:18:25,741 --> 00:18:27,450
The second one would be
the one of the best fights.

656
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:27,871
Welcome.

657
00:18:27,871 --> 00:18:28,704
Great fight.

658
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:32,460
And then those are like the only hard
moments he's had inside the octagon.

659
00:18:32,461 --> 00:18:32,731
Really.

660
00:18:32,731 --> 00:18:37,590
Other than like maybe round
five against Ricardo Lamas.

661
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:40,740
Member lamas had them down and it was
doing a little bit of ground and pound the

662
00:18:40,741 --> 00:18:41,490
fifth round.

663
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:42,600
But that was like all the,

664
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,980
was too drained,

665
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:44,850
making that weight.

666
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,080
But he's smaller now,

667
00:18:46,081 --> 00:18:46,350
you know,

668
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:48,150
he generally looks smaller.

669
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,710
He definitely,

670
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:50,190
uh,

671
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:52,900
chose to slim down and because,

672
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:53,490
yeah,

673
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:54,330
because he was,

674
00:18:54,331 --> 00:18:58,200
had unbelievably brutal weight
cuts early in his career.

675
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:03,230
He was just too big for the weight class
and so he just chose to a slim his body

676
00:19:03,811 --> 00:19:08,790
down your boy Vito fights nape mark hard
on that flip and that's his last fight

677
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:09,331
in the UFC.

678
00:19:09,331 --> 00:19:10,770
And then he says he's
going to go elsewhere.

679
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,690
Time for the return of T.

680
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:14,663
I can't wait.

681
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,310
He's going to Japan son,

682
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,590
Godzilla movies.

683
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,680
Go to Japan and fight super heavyweight.

684
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:25,800
He's going to get to 40 and celebrate
that and just happen to everyone with his

685
00:19:25,801 --> 00:19:27,390
chin and the fucking shit.

686
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:28,860
You can't find the chin,

687
00:19:28,861 --> 00:19:29,640
the eyeball thing.

688
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,473
Damn it.

689
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,633
Didn't find it.

690
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:35,300
Mark Kirk was in UFC 14,

691
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:36,450
which would be on fight pass,

692
00:19:36,451 --> 00:19:37,470
which I'm signing up for.

693
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:38,050
Oh,

694
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:38,883
okay.

695
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:40,260
Beautiful.

696
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,093
Um,

697
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,190
yeah man.

698
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:45,990
I like to see [inaudible] comeback and uh,

699
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:46,870
she was still the guild.

700
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:47,703
Juicy Gills,

701
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,060
Cro,

702
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:48,371
cop,

703
00:19:48,371 --> 00:19:48,930
heavyweight.

704
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:49,680
Well,

705
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,400
sign me up.

706
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,140
What's going on in rise in is like,

707
00:19:52,141 --> 00:19:53,250
it's all on the table.

708
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:53,551
You know,

709
00:19:53,551 --> 00:19:54,240
this is not,

710
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,520
there's no funny business on the table.

711
00:19:56,521 --> 00:19:57,820
A man do what you gotta do.

712
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,550
Everything's good just for recovery,

713
00:19:59,551 --> 00:19:59,850
Bro.

714
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:01,080
Just working for recovery.

715
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:01,861
Need recovery.

716
00:20:01,861 --> 00:20:03,750
It's important your recovery.

717
00:20:03,751 --> 00:20:05,160
You need yellow eyeballs.

718
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:09,060
Remember when Ben Johnson won the Olympics
and his eyeballs were yellow cause

719
00:20:09,061 --> 00:20:11,040
his liver was processing so much steroids.

720
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:11,923
Oh my God.

721
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:12,600
I just,

722
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,990
I don't know till whites
of his eyes were yellow.

723
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,341
Really yellow.

724
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:20,490
Yellow's was Ben Johnson and Johnson,

725
00:20:20,491 --> 00:20:24,360
the one who won the gold medal and was
the first like real publicly shamed

726
00:20:24,361 --> 00:20:25,080
steroids.

727
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,010
Do you remember how fast,

728
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,200
how he pulled away from
Carl Lewis and everybody?

729
00:20:28,201 --> 00:20:30,380
Just what you remember
what he looked like,

730
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:31,290
by the way,

731
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:33,750
Carl Lewis was on steroids
to correct all of them.

732
00:20:33,751 --> 00:20:35,700
Were his and Ben Johnson just better,

733
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:35,911
well,

734
00:20:35,911 --> 00:20:37,020
he just took way too much.

735
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:39,080
Took it to the Simpson.

736
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:39,271
Yeah.

737
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:40,104
He just,

738
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,940
I don't know what Carl Lewis was on,

739
00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:44,850
but I do know Carl Lewis tested
positive for quite a few things.

740
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,800
When I started researching
the history of doping,

741
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:52,020
when I had Victor Conte on from
the Barco scandal and the ultimate,

742
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,220
the ultimate super snitch,

743
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,930
he's the super snitch of all time.

744
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:00,080
And then talking to Lance
Armstrong and understanding like,

745
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:00,911
and then going into,

746
00:21:00,911 --> 00:21:04,870
I watched maybe five or
six documentaries on,

747
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,940
on drugs and sport,

748
00:21:05,941 --> 00:21:07,840
get your masters if you watch
that many documentaries,

749
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:11,560
when I feel the college degree,

750
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:12,820
I watched three of them and be like,

751
00:21:12,821 --> 00:21:13,654
I got this.

752
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:14,231
I got them.

753
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:14,660
Ask If,

754
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:19,420
so what I did take out of it was
that like according to Victor,

755
00:21:19,421 --> 00:21:20,254
Kanye,

756
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,870
all of the track and
field athletes are dirty.

757
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,490
It's more prevalent than track and field

758
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:30,160
track and field 100% what he was saying
essentially was that what Ben Johnson

759
00:21:30,161 --> 00:21:30,994
did was get caught.

760
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:33,910
But there was a lot of people that do
it and not only were they doing it,

761
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:37,690
but it was coordinated by coaches who
was coordinating part of the game.

762
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,000
And I say this all the time,

763
00:21:40,001 --> 00:21:42,670
I think it's just part
of professional sports.

764
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:43,601
It really is.

765
00:21:43,601 --> 00:21:45,310
I'm not saying your
favorite guys doing it,

766
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:46,940
but you know the,

767
00:21:46,941 --> 00:21:49,990
the odds are there's a lot of these
guys that you see on TV are doing it.

768
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,540
Do you guys think that there's this
part of the game steroids in boxing?

769
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:53,111
Oh,

770
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:53,650
for sure.

771
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:53,860
Yeah,

772
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:54,880
that's a serious question.

773
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:58,300
Well don't you understand that Shannon
Briggs just got pulled out of his world

774
00:21:58,301 --> 00:22:01,810
title fights per test and he's 45 he's 45.

775
00:22:01,811 --> 00:22:02,521
I'm talking about like,

776
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:03,580
cause not to say,

777
00:22:03,581 --> 00:22:04,690
I'm not saying anybody's doing it,

778
00:22:04,691 --> 00:22:08,780
but when I watched the Kell Brook or
all spans fight great fight by the way.

779
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:11,200
Amazing fighters spends on it.

780
00:22:11,201 --> 00:22:12,880
Athlete New World Champs,

781
00:22:12,881 --> 00:22:13,610
Right Doug?

782
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:13,970
Yeah,

783
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:18,970
that's right on an athlete in his domain
and he got it kind of boxed up for the

784
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:21,124
first few rounds.

785
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,390
But winning those firsts when the,

786
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,790
when they brought up
the scorecard and like,

787
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:23,991
God,

788
00:22:23,991 --> 00:22:24,641
I disagree.

789
00:22:24,641 --> 00:22:25,474
I feel like broken.

790
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,840
Well I agreed with what's his face?

791
00:22:28,841 --> 00:22:29,050
Uh,

792
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:29,950
Steve Farr firewood.

793
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:30,521
Is that his name?

794
00:22:30,521 --> 00:22:31,031
Steve Farr.

795
00:22:31,031 --> 00:22:31,330
Hood,

796
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:32,020
firewood.

797
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,260
And each time what that brought up the,

798
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,830
he's the herald letter of enough
showtime a lot better though.

799
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:37,510
You like them better?

800
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:37,890
Yeah.

801
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:38,700
You're like,

802
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,700
all right everybody,

803
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:40,653
here we go.

804
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:41,980
Jesus Christ.

805
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:44,110
It's not a bad crash.

806
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,250
It's so intense.

807
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,600
It's so intense.

808
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:48,270
It throws me off.

809
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,540
But that fight was great.

810
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:49,900
I had,

811
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,330
I had Kell Brook right in
there that round seven.

812
00:22:52,331 --> 00:22:54,940
He was still doing work
around or two away at least.

813
00:22:54,941 --> 00:22:59,380
And then Spence just put it on them and
those body shots were ruthless and his

814
00:22:59,381 --> 00:23:00,880
endurance is incredible.

815
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:01,240
They,

816
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,600
my favorite part is if you go back
and listen carefully to the corners,

817
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,980
they pulled out at the same game plan.

818
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:06,221
All right.

819
00:23:06,221 --> 00:23:06,760
We just got again,

820
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,910
pass the 10th round and then we're gonna
put it on him and they go to the other

821
00:23:09,911 --> 00:23:10,270
corner.

822
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:12,490
Let's just get past the 10
and then it's all you baby.

823
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,061
Yeah,

824
00:23:13,061 --> 00:23:14,270
they both say the same thing.

825
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:14,420
Well,

826
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,061
Kell Brook.

827
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:15,311
Dot.

828
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:18,770
That Spence was just not experienced
enough and didn't have the cause.

829
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,820
He's been knocking everybody
out and he's really been,

830
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:24,070
he's only done 10 rounds
and his corner fell.

831
00:23:24,071 --> 00:23:25,420
A Kell Brook cut too much weight.

832
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,060
Yeah.

833
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:27,411
Yeah.

834
00:23:27,411 --> 00:23:28,001
So they were like,

835
00:23:28,001 --> 00:23:28,181
look,

836
00:23:28,181 --> 00:23:31,540
this guy fucking not to go Lufkin and
one 60 like he's going to be struggling

837
00:23:31,541 --> 00:23:31,920
here.

838
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,670
Yeah.

839
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:33,310
It's interesting.

840
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:34,940
Very interesting now,

841
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:36,040
nor dental lab.

842
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,380
Who's the boy fighting the
man that that's a really,

843
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:40,540
nor dean to lab is a bad ass.

844
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:41,410
Fucking Stryker.

845
00:23:41,411 --> 00:23:42,520
I do not know this gentleman,

846
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:43,480
but he looks dangerous.

847
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:44,453
Here's like a doodle.

848
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:45,783
He's a car.

849
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:47,750
18 years old.

850
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:48,520
Here it is.

851
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,353
Yes.

852
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:50,180
I know.

853
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:50,930
This is not,

854
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:51,830
this is not the fight.

855
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:56,340
It's a different fight because
that is not a god Damn Boba Shit.

856
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:58,160
That's crazy.

857
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:58,993
That's all.

858
00:23:59,050 --> 00:23:59,883
It's natural.

859
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:01,890
Damn mobish is the guy to look.

860
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:02,181
Yeah.

861
00:24:02,181 --> 00:24:02,930
Dan mobish.

862
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:04,160
I forget who that guy is.

863
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,840
That guy's a karate guy though.

864
00:24:05,841 --> 00:24:07,940
He's wearing a karate
guy and he fucked up.

865
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:08,590
Yeah,

866
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:08,901
I got it.

867
00:24:08,901 --> 00:24:09,980
Got Super smashed.

868
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:10,381
He's this.

869
00:24:10,381 --> 00:24:11,041
He's that.

870
00:24:11,041 --> 00:24:12,560
I'm Mochi.

871
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:14,870
Horenstein ah damn.

872
00:24:14,871 --> 00:24:16,630
How could is my fucking UFC memory?

873
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:20,570
This kid looks like Krav
Maga guys from nothing.

874
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,590
Seven.

875
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:22,341
Have you seen this?

876
00:24:22,341 --> 00:24:24,230
The 35 year old fight
in the 19 year old here.

877
00:24:24,231 --> 00:24:24,831
What's going on here?

878
00:24:24,831 --> 00:24:26,870
It's the [inaudible] lab is a beast,

879
00:24:26,871 --> 00:24:27,680
man.

880
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,820
Gotta check 35 year old.

881
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:30,980
You gotta check your head.

882
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,353
What are you doing in your head?

883
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:33,270
You're fine.

884
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:36,680
You look normal knowing
cause he's an actor.

885
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:37,723
He's an actor.

886
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:39,050
Makes his living off his face.

887
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,190
Well we don't have anything coming up.

888
00:24:40,191 --> 00:24:41,210
It's such an odd character.

889
00:24:41,211 --> 00:24:42,440
This Brian Strange Bird.

890
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,023
Strange bird.

891
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:46,823
Like

892
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:50,860
what is this Doug Davidoff talk dovetails.

893
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,660
Just tough guys.

894
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:52,041
Tough guy.

895
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:54,620
Like what the fuck you saying?

896
00:24:54,621 --> 00:24:54,831
Okay,

897
00:24:54,831 --> 00:24:55,611
so here's damn boat,

898
00:24:55,611 --> 00:24:56,230
which look,

899
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:56,440
see,

900
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,500
he gets on top of him.

901
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:58,020
Fuck.

902
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:58,190
See,

903
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:02,630
fighting Bobas was a tank to a
big old strong man looking dude.

904
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:06,200
So he gets on top of them and watch
what he does with his Chin is a beer.

905
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,090
He gets the chin.

906
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,750
I believe he pressed his
face up against the cage.

907
00:25:11,751 --> 00:25:12,970
Who went for a head on now,

908
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:13,813
here it is right here.

909
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:14,630
Right here.

910
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:15,170
Chin.

911
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:16,020
Right to the Isat.

912
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:16,761
Get Dude.

913
00:25:16,761 --> 00:25:21,761
You know how bad that would fucking
smush and he's covering his eyes.

914
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:24,320
Fucking Christ.

915
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:25,580
Big John McCarthy.

916
00:25:25,581 --> 00:25:25,941
Yeah.

917
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:26,870
That's where you want to quit.

918
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,240
That's a legit move.

919
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:30,830
I wonder if you can still do that.

920
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:33,680
The challenge in the eye and I'm using
it and my next door neighbor said that.

921
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:33,891
But no,

922
00:25:33,891 --> 00:25:34,820
you can't touch the eyes.

923
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,291
There's nothing.

924
00:25:35,291 --> 00:25:36,140
You're not touching it.

925
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:40,880
You're just holding onto him sneaking
the Chin into the eye socket recently.

926
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,540
What'd you say,

927
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:41,900
Jamie?

928
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,970
There's another fight in a form
that said it happened in two.

929
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:44,923
I don't.

930
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:45,823
Interesting guys.

931
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,313
Algin correct.

932
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,750
There was a fight recently
with your Chin Sorta,

933
00:25:50,751 --> 00:25:53,660
but I mean isn't it an eye gouging
when you shoved her knuckle in there?

934
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:54,501
Yeah.

935
00:25:54,501 --> 00:25:55,640
Which is also illegal,

936
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:56,563
but when you knuckle,

937
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,500
when you punch someone,

938
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:00,500
but that's unintentional.

939
00:26:00,501 --> 00:26:01,350
Is it short?

940
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,560
Is trying to punch him in the eyeball,

941
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:03,620
try and punch me with other things.

942
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:06,730
But Haysman beat Elvis and no cinesync

943
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:09,183
belt.

944
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:10,100
It was a while ago.

945
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,700
That's interesting because
Elvis is a Machado black belt.

946
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:13,963
What's this commercial?

947
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:15,530
But by the time you're,

948
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,790
you know,

949
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:19,280
in that position and of course
to fuck was going on here.

950
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:20,121
Christopher Walken,

951
00:26:20,121 --> 00:26:20,954
what are you selling?

952
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:21,980
Five calories.

953
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:23,360
Um,

954
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:23,900
what was the,

955
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,690
what was the fight recently in UFC where,

956
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:28,820
where the guy was covering the other
guy's mouth so he couldn't breathe.

957
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:30,860
That sounds brutal.

958
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,281
Brutal.

959
00:26:31,281 --> 00:26:32,114
And time.

960
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:32,990
I mean,

961
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:33,621
that's not that bad.

962
00:26:33,621 --> 00:26:33,890
No.

963
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:34,481
Bj Penn,

964
00:26:34,481 --> 00:26:35,241
you do that all the time.

965
00:26:35,241 --> 00:26:36,530
That's how he used to get guys to,

966
00:26:36,531 --> 00:26:37,190
uh,

967
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:40,460
he would cover their mouth when he took
their back and then they would try to

968
00:26:40,461 --> 00:26:44,140
stop that and then he would grab their
arm with his leg and then he would choke

969
00:26:44,141 --> 00:26:44,610
him.

970
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:45,510
Ken Anderson,

971
00:26:45,511 --> 00:26:46,440
Anderson Silva.

972
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:47,833
It's good.

973
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:48,590
Common move.

974
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:49,170
Yeah.

975
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:49,830
Yeah.

976
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:50,670
That's pretty common.

977
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,793
I don't use it.

978
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:53,421
How's it going?

979
00:26:53,421 --> 00:26:53,730
Use it.

980
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:54,500
I tried doing her.

981
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:57,900
Doug Davidoff use it as a master.

982
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,660
Who's doing it there?

983
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:02,880
Chris Haysman.

984
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,330
Elvis.

985
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,170
Elvis in a sick,

986
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:04,861
that's the shit.

987
00:27:04,861 --> 00:27:06,410
That whole just wore back
a little bit with this.

988
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,800
No holds bar TV.

989
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:08,131
Oh yeah.

990
00:27:08,131 --> 00:27:09,480
This is no gloves too.

991
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:11,190
Yeah.

992
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:13,140
Elvis might not have even
been a black belt back then.

993
00:27:13,141 --> 00:27:13,770
He's tapping.

994
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:14,461
Oh Jesus.

995
00:27:14,461 --> 00:27:16,830
He's tapping to the eyeball to eyeball.

996
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:17,723
Damn.

997
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:21,630
Chris Haysman also had a fucking
wicked front lake sidekick.

998
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,340
He's one of the first guys in MMA.

999
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:25,710
They figured out how to use
our front leg side kick.

1000
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:29,270
Well like I just fucking poked his out
and had a flat top so it gets the win

1001
00:27:29,271 --> 00:27:29,430
there.

1002
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:32,800
That's Haysman flat top
pace speaking advice.

1003
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,980
Did Kell Brook hurt the same break?

1004
00:27:34,981 --> 00:27:35,581
The same orbital?

1005
00:27:35,581 --> 00:27:36,980
No different than one tip.

1006
00:27:36,981 --> 00:27:38,970
And I hear he's got titanium,

1007
00:27:38,971 --> 00:27:39,330
I guess.

1008
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:41,310
Is that for the titanium from triple g?

1009
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:43,363
Yeah,

1010
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,520
he got boxed up.

1011
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:48,420
God maybe it's good to have two titanium
eyes and then the other one broken too.

1012
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:49,790
Did he break his left leg keep too,

1013
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,581
I feel like he did.

1014
00:27:50,581 --> 00:27:53,090
His addiction needs similar thing.

1015
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:53,950
Yeah,

1016
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:54,840
that was a bummer man.

1017
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:55,230
I mean he's,

1018
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:58,230
I was all flattened out but he also could
have been like really paranoid about

1019
00:27:58,231 --> 00:27:59,310
it because of the triple chins.

1020
00:27:59,311 --> 00:28:01,080
What I think cause he went back surgery,

1021
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:01,470
he's like,

1022
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:02,810
I'm not losing my left wider.

1023
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:03,653
That's fine.

1024
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:04,710
It's always in your mind.

1025
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:05,581
And by the way,

1026
00:28:05,581 --> 00:28:07,800
you don't know what kind of
vision damage he suffered.

1027
00:28:07,801 --> 00:28:09,780
Like a guy like Bisping's tough as fuck.

1028
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:12,960
He will tell you he's got
bad vision in his right eye.

1029
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:17,480
I mean you won't hear someone come to
a fight or analyze a fight about bisman

1030
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:17,611
go.

1031
00:28:17,611 --> 00:28:19,800
And he's also doing it
with one and a half eyes.

1032
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,960
Like it's well known
knowledge like you suffering.

1033
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:22,890
But what is the deal?

1034
00:28:22,891 --> 00:28:23,970
Because back in the day,

1035
00:28:23,971 --> 00:28:27,060
like if you had like a
detached retina or something,

1036
00:28:27,061 --> 00:28:28,080
like they wouldn't let you fight.

1037
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:28,321
No,

1038
00:28:28,321 --> 00:28:28,921
because he's got,

1039
00:28:28,921 --> 00:28:30,750
so I talked to him a little bit about it.

1040
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,920
He's got oil now,

1041
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:33,840
I don't want to fuck this up

1042
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:38,310
so he can't really fix it yet.

1043
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:39,411
He's takes his it.

1044
00:28:39,411 --> 00:28:39,750
Yeah,

1045
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,850
because if he gets another shot
then it could do more damage.

1046
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:42,150
So,

1047
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:42,983
and I don't know if the,

1048
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:46,350
I think it kind of came up
with the thing with GSP to,

1049
00:28:46,351 --> 00:28:48,270
it's his medical that has
something to do with his eye.

1050
00:28:48,271 --> 00:28:48,811
It came out,

1051
00:28:48,811 --> 00:28:49,870
now it's,

1052
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,250
we talked about it.

1053
00:28:51,251 --> 00:28:51,720
He's got a,

1054
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,940
what's called a floater in his eye.

1055
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:54,803
It's like,

1056
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:56,490
it's like a little bit of damage.

1057
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:58,350
There's something going
on with his eyeball.

1058
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:01,050
And that was the holdup
is skewed to fight.

1059
00:29:01,051 --> 00:29:01,801
I hate when people,

1060
00:29:01,801 --> 00:29:02,071
it's like,

1061
00:29:02,071 --> 00:29:02,400
well,

1062
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,510
do you have see knew about it?

1063
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:04,561
Everybody knew about it,

1064
00:29:04,561 --> 00:29:06,000
but they were hoping
that they could fix it.

1065
00:29:06,001 --> 00:29:08,640
And I believe they gave
some injections to his eye.

1066
00:29:08,641 --> 00:29:09,630
They tried to repair it.

1067
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,910
It's not like threatening his vision.

1068
00:29:11,911 --> 00:29:13,110
It's not like a permanent issue.

1069
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:13,973
It's a time issue.

1070
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:14,790
So this guy,

1071
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:15,780
something needs to heal.

1072
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:19,690
This guy cut zero weight and
the other guy cut 30 pounds.

1073
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,461
You don't know.

1074
00:29:20,461 --> 00:29:20,821
I don't know.

1075
00:29:20,821 --> 00:29:24,780
But I liked the way that guys throwing
it's old school karate sidekicks a warm

1076
00:29:24,781 --> 00:29:25,440
up.

1077
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,520
I like mark as a ref.

1078
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:26,980
Did they?

1079
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:27,390
Uh,

1080
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,410
how old is this kid?

1081
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:29,483
Did they say?

1082
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:30,930
I think they said he's 19 now.

1083
00:29:30,931 --> 00:29:31,710
He's 25.

1084
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:32,550
20 new.

1085
00:29:32,551 --> 00:29:33,280
Wow.

1086
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:33,840
Is He?

1087
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,230
Yeah,

1088
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:34,790
he's just,

1089
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:34,920
Oh,

1090
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,870
you just said he's nice town.

1091
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:37,723
But I mean,

1092
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:38,431
I'm sorry sir.

1093
00:29:38,431 --> 00:29:39,780
But excuse me.

1094
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:41,140
It's the UFC be all right.

1095
00:29:41,141 --> 00:29:42,020
But um,

1096
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:42,400
what,

1097
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,233
what's going on?

1098
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,340
Who's the youngest guy
to ever fight in the UFC?

1099
00:29:45,341 --> 00:29:48,300
I want to say it's Dan Lozan for it.

1100
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:48,820
Yeah.

1101
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:49,420
I think Dan.

1102
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,120
No.

1103
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:53,440
[inaudible] 19 I think Dan
Lozano was 18 how old was sage?

1104
00:29:53,441 --> 00:29:57,160
Northcutt 22 um,

1105
00:29:57,490 --> 00:30:01,600
nor dean to the guy in the red
shorts is a bad ass striker.

1106
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:02,520
Amazing striker.

1107
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:04,690
I tried to start very fucking technics.

1108
00:30:04,691 --> 00:30:05,230
Super Freak.

1109
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:06,490
Super Technical.

1110
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:07,930
Look at that.

1111
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:09,430
Look at that beautiful movement.

1112
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:10,293
Yeah.

1113
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:10,571
Yeah.

1114
00:30:10,571 --> 00:30:10,901
He's,

1115
00:30:10,901 --> 00:30:11,980
he's elite shit.

1116
00:30:11,981 --> 00:30:12,581
This youngster,

1117
00:30:12,581 --> 00:30:14,670
he fucking around kid guys.

1118
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,720
It's really bad.

1119
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:18,010
Back to he laughed at it.

1120
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:19,810
He's very karate based though.

1121
00:30:19,811 --> 00:30:20,411
You could tell,

1122
00:30:20,411 --> 00:30:21,790
but him throwing that,

1123
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:23,283
that kick.

1124
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:24,660
You don't,

1125
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:28,120
how old was the Joe Lozan when he
fought Jens Pulver on that short notice?

1126
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:28,961
I'm going to say he was 20.

1127
00:30:28,961 --> 00:30:29,830
He might've been the youngest.

1128
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:30,700
Not,

1129
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,061
no,

1130
00:30:31,061 --> 00:30:31,650
I don't think so.

1131
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:33,760
Not Man's composed.

1132
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:36,890
Oh yeah.

1133
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,590
He knocked out Jens Pulver the left Hook,

1134
00:30:38,591 --> 00:30:38,860
right?

1135
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:39,260
Yep.

1136
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:39,850
Oh,

1137
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:40,061
that.

1138
00:30:40,061 --> 00:30:41,290
And he's a huge underdog.

1139
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:43,090
Gotcha.

1140
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:43,490
Loads on.

1141
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:44,690
Still doing the damn thing too.

1142
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:46,030
He's a bad motherfucker.

1143
00:30:46,031 --> 00:30:50,500
Joe Lowe's smart as
shit to super smart guy.

1144
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,131
Yeah.

1145
00:30:51,131 --> 00:30:53,860
I mean easily could have
been like some it tech guy.

1146
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:54,490
Really?

1147
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:54,760
Yeah.

1148
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,860
But he said Chunky for adrenaline.

1149
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,750
He's a beast video game guy too.

1150
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:02,110
This guy is definitely taekwondo guy.

1151
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:03,410
Say That guy's name and camp.

1152
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:04,400
I don't think it's taekwondo,

1153
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:04,660
man.

1154
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:05,560
I think it's karate.

1155
00:31:05,561 --> 00:31:06,430
I could be wrong,

1156
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:09,580
but you know the thing of the problem
with saying it's taekwondo versus karate.

1157
00:31:09,581 --> 00:31:11,850
He's like a really depends
on who's teaching a kick,

1158
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:12,120
right?

1159
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,420
Dax like taekwondo,

1160
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,190
but oh,

1161
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:16,720
but a lot of good showed pecan guys.

1162
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,100
They throw kicks that way too.

1163
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:19,660
The,

1164
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:20,530
Ooh Norton.

1165
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:21,610
It's chewing up that leg.

1166
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:22,871
That hurt him too.

1167
00:31:22,871 --> 00:31:23,680
That bothering the way.

1168
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,900
Nordine kicks in much bigger.

1169
00:31:25,901 --> 00:31:26,734
I'm taekwondo.

1170
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:27,670
I don't,

1171
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:29,410
I mean he's definitely more muscular,

1172
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:29,911
but he's,

1173
00:31:29,911 --> 00:31:30,780
I don't think he's much bigger,

1174
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:31,690
much heavier.

1175
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:32,530
Walking around.

1176
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:33,341
He'd lay his frame.

1177
00:31:33,341 --> 00:31:34,210
He just looks at price,

1178
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:35,710
walks around at 200 pounds.

1179
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,750
Whereas this guy walks
around at one 70 well,

1180
00:31:37,751 --> 00:31:39,850
he also looks like a man or was there,

1181
00:31:39,851 --> 00:31:42,850
the kid looks very young to keep
monetizing that Logan movie.

1182
00:31:42,851 --> 00:31:44,350
That shit is so depressing.

1183
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:44,980
Is it?

1184
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:45,490
Oh my,

1185
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:47,230
it's wolverine with cancer.

1186
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,550
He can through life.

1187
00:31:48,551 --> 00:31:49,600
He's a limo driver.

1188
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:53,290
I'm not interested in oil or
he's a Goddamn limo driver.

1189
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:53,591
Stop.

1190
00:31:53,591 --> 00:31:54,424
Don't do this to me.

1191
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:55,180
Well,

1192
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,250
I'm trying to help you guys out.

1193
00:31:56,251 --> 00:31:59,050
You'd want to see a couple of people
told me that the alien movie sucks and I

1194
00:31:59,051 --> 00:32:01,450
almost don't like told you that
I'm a piss down their throat.

1195
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,240
It's the best movie I've seen this year.

1196
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:06,260
Feel best fucking,

1197
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:08,190
I was so excited.

1198
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,490
Me and you were crunk for that.

1199
00:32:09,491 --> 00:32:10,324
I saw.

1200
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:12,040
I have a 15 month old,

1201
00:32:12,041 --> 00:32:13,210
so it's hard for me to see movies.

1202
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:14,790
I got a babysitter.

1203
00:32:14,791 --> 00:32:15,850
I saw it opening night.

1204
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,770
I standing ovation.

1205
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:23,050
That's what I want to hear.

1206
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:27,280
I got my cheated on my Twizzlers at
dice code is trying to get the take down

1207
00:32:27,281 --> 00:32:28,390
here with a weird move.

1208
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,810
It's we know shit's going on
with the second one again.

1209
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:31,653
It's like fuck it.

1210
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:32,500
Don't lives man.

1211
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,640
Maybe he's got a good ground game.

1212
00:32:33,641 --> 00:32:35,320
You remember I'm Gunnar Nell's.

1213
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:35,681
Ooh,

1214
00:32:35,681 --> 00:32:36,760
that's a beautiful trip.

1215
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:36,971
Hey,

1216
00:32:36,971 --> 00:32:38,020
that's a beautiful trip.

1217
00:32:38,021 --> 00:32:38,854
Pass too.

1218
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,030
I'm very jealous.

1219
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:44,030
I control has that crazy karate style.

1220
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:47,240
Go to Nelson with some sort of a karate
champion before he was into a world

1221
00:32:47,241 --> 00:32:47,511
champion.

1222
00:32:47,511 --> 00:32:48,530
He's a picky Steiger.

1223
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:53,720
He heard what this kid has come.

1224
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:55,010
Oh Shit and camp.

1225
00:32:55,011 --> 00:32:58,370
We need to sleep on this kid
talking about pretty boy in camp.

1226
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:00,320
Do this kids built like Doug Davidoff.

1227
00:33:00,321 --> 00:33:01,340
That's exactly right.

1228
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:03,350
Brian won't shut up about their bodies.

1229
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:06,330
How I think about Jenna,

1230
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,160
Brendan,

1231
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:07,670
I have,

1232
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:08,451
I have neurosis.

1233
00:33:08,451 --> 00:33:09,111
I have deep seated.

1234
00:33:09,111 --> 00:33:10,130
Neurosis is breaking down.

1235
00:33:10,131 --> 00:33:11,640
Yo kind of watch that back.

1236
00:33:11,641 --> 00:33:11,811
Heck,

1237
00:33:11,811 --> 00:33:12,800
that's not what we practice.

1238
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:14,120
Not really.

1239
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,490
Telegraph sat back kick.

1240
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:15,800
Yeah,

1241
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,670
don't move that front foot.

1242
00:33:16,671 --> 00:33:17,750
Just turn your shoulders man.

1243
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,590
Oh good.

1244
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:19,423
You're running in there.

1245
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,361
Careful.

1246
00:33:20,361 --> 00:33:21,650
Now you should give him advice me.

1247
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:22,550
Well I was,

1248
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:25,150
I was breaking down Yolanda
Whitaker and Brian goes with the,

1249
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:26,810
with those pegs you think,

1250
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,520
oh Geez,

1251
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:28,800
you know what?

1252
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,660
I'm going to do this another time.

1253
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,190
I was dead serious.

1254
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,350
I wasn't wearing pants either.

1255
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:34,071
Oh,

1256
00:33:34,071 --> 00:33:34,550
this kid.

1257
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:35,930
Oh look at this fucking exchange.

1258
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:38,990
Good exchange of knees
here this day and age,

1259
00:33:38,991 --> 00:33:42,100
you really don't get to the UFC
unless you're fucking game game man.

1260
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:43,123
Like anyone who sees.

1261
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:43,731
Can Be really,

1262
00:33:43,731 --> 00:33:44,500
really tough.

1263
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,310
The level so much higher
than it used to be.

1264
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,313
You know what I'm saying?

1265
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,570
You got 50 seconds.

1266
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:51,500
That's what I be saying.

1267
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,100
So strollers,

1268
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:52,670
posture,

1269
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:53,750
strong mission control.

1270
00:33:53,751 --> 00:33:54,584
Here.

1271
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,060
He wrapped that up real quick.

1272
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:56,840
Real quick.

1273
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:56,991
Hey,

1274
00:33:56,991 --> 00:34:00,950
the kid going to the has bound the kid
really good on the that Center Rubber

1275
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:01,370
Guard gentlemen.

1276
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:01,940
Yes,

1277
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:02,680
correct.

1278
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,250
But he's also going for an arm bar here.

1279
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:05,440
The arms wait,

1280
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:06,783
tweet too hard.

1281
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:07,910
Look at the control though.

1282
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,380
It's his posture control.

1283
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:10,523
Whoa.

1284
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:12,230
You and I are going.

1285
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:13,063
It's out.

1286
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:14,110
It's like Jesus.

1287
00:34:14,111 --> 00:34:15,640
He's in Trello clothes.

1288
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,930
Got My blue belt in 2000 guys.

1289
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:19,603
The game's evolved.

1290
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,330
Did you get your blue
belt in 2000 sure did.

1291
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,233
Henzel Gracie,

1292
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,140
the heads on Gracie Blue Bell.

1293
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:28,580
What did you think they would let you
have it now if you went back to class.

1294
00:34:28,581 --> 00:34:29,780
They keep wanting to give him my purple.

1295
00:34:29,781 --> 00:34:30,530
Just honorary.

1296
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:31,400
Do you think they would say,

1297
00:34:31,401 --> 00:34:31,911
listen man,

1298
00:34:31,911 --> 00:34:32,571
you've got to go back to,

1299
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:34,450
why do you guys have to
put you back in a while?

1300
00:34:34,451 --> 00:34:35,570
I would volunteer that.

1301
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:38,510
Do you ever get like demoted?

1302
00:34:38,511 --> 00:34:39,590
Like do you ever get a purple belt?

1303
00:34:39,591 --> 00:34:40,120
And then,

1304
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:40,320
oh,

1305
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,140
that happened to me when I
pushed up the Gracie Kennedy.

1306
00:34:42,141 --> 00:34:43,820
They made me wear a white
belt for a long time.

1307
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:46,430
I've got a brown belt from someone else.

1308
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:48,010
I was in a white belt for a while.

1309
00:34:48,011 --> 00:34:49,160
Who did you ever brown boat from?

1310
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:50,203
Amal Easton.

1311
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:50,821
A mall.

1312
00:34:50,821 --> 00:34:51,200
Wait a minute.

1313
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,250
A Mall East and give you a brown belt
and the Gracies told you you have to wear

1314
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:55,810
white belt and St.

1315
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:59,390
It was just like for the first few weeks
just to see what my level is that why

1316
00:34:59,391 --> 00:34:59,651
does it,

1317
00:34:59,651 --> 00:35:00,441
but you're in a mall,

1318
00:35:00,441 --> 00:35:02,400
Easton Brown belt that is very,

1319
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:03,620
very legit.

1320
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,540
That's not like Freddie Mercury.

1321
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:08,250
Some fucking dude.

1322
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:09,103
The Midwest,

1323
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:12,410
the other Freddie Mercury St Mustache.

1324
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,600
We'll have a lot in common.

1325
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:16,580
When I trained in Brazil too,

1326
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:17,690
they made me wear light belt.

1327
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,713
What?

1328
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:21,080
I feel like that's so disrespectful.

1329
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:23,840
You have a brown belt from you
should they should say from who?

1330
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:24,950
Amal Easton.

1331
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:25,250
Oh,

1332
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:25,461
okay.

1333
00:35:25,461 --> 00:35:26,294
Come on in

1334
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:28,251
tribal though.

1335
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:29,084
And it's so,

1336
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:29,361
yeah,

1337
00:35:29,361 --> 00:35:30,720
but that's the same tribe.

1338
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:31,280
Yeah,

1339
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,840
it's a Henzel Gracie black belt.

1340
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:34,520
I think it was more just like,

1341
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:35,350
I don't know.

1342
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:36,500
I had no issue with it.

1343
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:37,380
I literally do not care.

1344
00:35:37,381 --> 00:35:39,270
But I would tell guys if they
didn't know who I was as like,

1345
00:35:39,271 --> 00:35:39,480
yeah,

1346
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,380
I'm not a white belt,

1347
00:35:40,381 --> 00:35:41,310
and I'm just like,

1348
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:42,061
I know we go on,

1349
00:35:42,061 --> 00:35:43,020
I'm not a white belt brother.

1350
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:43,591
He's be like,

1351
00:35:43,591 --> 00:35:44,424
no,

1352
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,870
we can make fucking ears,

1353
00:35:45,871 --> 00:35:46,704
man.

1354
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:47,903
Yeah.

1355
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:48,600
But I mean,

1356
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,310
dude,

1357
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:50,100
that's just,

1358
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,150
I don't understand that.

1359
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,070
It was only for like two or three weeks.

1360
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,810
Was this one you were in the UFC?

1361
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:55,650
Yeah.

1362
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:56,430
Jesus Christ.

1363
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:57,263
Everyone can.

1364
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,770
I most people knew,

1365
00:35:58,771 --> 00:35:59,604
you know,

1366
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,170
just doesn't make any sense.

1367
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:01,740
Yeah,

1368
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,030
that seems really weird to me.

1369
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,640
I went to that a beginner's
class and fuck them up.

1370
00:36:05,641 --> 00:36:06,740
Don't just to

1371
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,910
me 10 yellow belts.

1372
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:15,510
I don't like you doing your mood.

1373
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,280
I don't like you doing
that somersault move on me.

1374
00:36:17,281 --> 00:36:18,114
It's annoying.

1375
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:20,280
What was that thing you just did to me?

1376
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:21,031
Somersault,

1377
00:36:21,031 --> 00:36:23,140
move and he just grabbed me

1378
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:25,920
and I and that's,

1379
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:28,650
that's where I sustained
or he just got robbed.

1380
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:29,790
Oh Jesus.

1381
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:32,400
Great check left hook boy.

1382
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:35,120
Just kids winging these guys are kid.

1383
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:36,180
It was a great fight,

1384
00:36:36,181 --> 00:36:36,390
man.

1385
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:36,841
Break out.

1386
00:36:36,841 --> 00:36:38,070
Do you still have that Tesla?

1387
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:38,491
Yes,

1388
00:36:38,491 --> 00:36:40,080
I do and I love broken down at all.

1389
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:40,741
No Dude,

1390
00:36:40,741 --> 00:36:41,401
it's my favorite car.

1391
00:36:41,401 --> 00:36:42,300
I'll never have another car.

1392
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:43,590
I'm a test a man.

1393
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:46,290
Sam Harris is Tesla
broke down twice on him.

1394
00:36:46,291 --> 00:36:46,770
Why Tay?

1395
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:47,700
I love hearing that.

1396
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:49,950
Left them stranded in a wet hair and that.

1397
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:50,260
Yeah,

1398
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:53,430
he had like a full charge and
it said pull over immediately.

1399
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:56,220
Your car is not safe to
drive and it's like why?

1400
00:36:56,221 --> 00:36:57,054
It's annoying.

1401
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:58,560
My Tesla is impeccable.

1402
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,760
I'll never have another one.

1403
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:00,781
I'm a Tesla guy.

1404
00:37:00,781 --> 00:37:01,411
Just like I'm a,

1405
00:37:01,411 --> 00:37:02,850
I'm a front foot side kick guy.

1406
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:03,601
I'm a Tesla guy.

1407
00:37:03,601 --> 00:37:04,434
Front foot's.

1408
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:05,280
Yeah,

1409
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,350
I mean only in street
fighting because it's sneaky.

1410
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:08,941
I haven't even opened up.

1411
00:37:08,941 --> 00:37:10,050
I'm Brendan with my kicks yet.

1412
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:11,311
You want to want to get you?

1413
00:37:11,311 --> 00:37:12,690
I want to get an older Porsche man.

1414
00:37:12,691 --> 00:37:13,560
That's why I'm in the market for,

1415
00:37:13,561 --> 00:37:16,020
I believe you were talking to me about it.

1416
00:37:16,021 --> 00:37:17,340
Don't you fuck with those targets?

1417
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:17,520
No.

1418
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,090
I want a car that makes
noise when you drive it.

1419
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:20,581
I don't care.

1420
00:37:20,581 --> 00:37:21,750
The wind whistling in.

1421
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,110
Those things are shifting.

1422
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:25,591
It's going to be fun,

1423
00:37:25,591 --> 00:37:26,100
man.

1424
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:26,940
If you give this one,

1425
00:37:26,941 --> 00:37:27,840
this one's redundant.

1426
00:37:27,841 --> 00:37:28,201
Has It?

1427
00:37:28,201 --> 00:37:29,250
Has a bunch of new stuff.

1428
00:37:29,251 --> 00:37:30,084
You're going to get it.

1429
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:30,570
You are,

1430
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:31,061
you're already,

1431
00:37:31,061 --> 00:37:31,894
you're,

1432
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:32,911
did I look at it?

1433
00:37:32,911 --> 00:37:33,744
Maybe.

1434
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,580
Did I send that text from the dealer?

1435
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,300
Maybe.

1436
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,200
What year is it?

1437
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,700
It's a 88.

1438
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:39,623
Did you drive it?

1439
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:40,230
No,

1440
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:40,891
they tried like,

1441
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:41,360
shit,

1442
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,030
it doesn't matter.

1443
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:42,751
This one's new.

1444
00:37:42,751 --> 00:37:44,190
It's a bunch of modifications.

1445
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:44,840
Yeah.

1446
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,630
Puncture.

1447
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,250
If Brendan has something in his head,

1448
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:49,530
if he starts talking about
it isn't going to happen.

1449
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,300
It's going to help with these older cut.

1450
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:52,890
Like I've looked at a few now.

1451
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:53,700
It's just,

1452
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,230
it's just like a weekend driver.

1453
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:55,790
Yeah.

1454
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:56,090
Um,

1455
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:57,480
what do you recommend for a Porsche?

1456
00:37:57,481 --> 00:37:58,440
Do you want to get a used one,

1457
00:37:58,450 --> 00:37:59,283
Brendan?

1458
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:03,640
78 there's some really good
used Porsches like you.

1459
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:03,961
I mean,

1460
00:38:03,961 --> 00:38:04,980
even the early models,

1461
00:38:04,981 --> 00:38:06,000
they're really fun to drive,

1462
00:38:06,001 --> 00:38:07,440
but you got to know what
you're getting into.

1463
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:07,980
Yes.

1464
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:08,910
You don't want a lemon.

1465
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,830
And those cars are really,

1466
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,750
they're really fickle.

1467
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,070
Like when you turn it,

1468
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:17,460
like say if you're making a
turn and you're on the gas,

1469
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:18,990
if you let up off the gas,

1470
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:23,660
they'll oversteer like the back half
ass end of the car will come out on it.

1471
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:23,761
No,

1472
00:38:23,761 --> 00:38:25,200
it's a far cry from the,

1473
00:38:25,201 --> 00:38:25,441
you know,

1474
00:38:25,441 --> 00:38:26,161
a new Porsche,

1475
00:38:26,161 --> 00:38:26,994
something like that.

1476
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:27,921
New Twin Turbo.

1477
00:38:27,921 --> 00:38:32,370
That nine nine one that you use to
drive like that is as modern as it gets.

1478
00:38:32,371 --> 00:38:34,410
I mean those things are
glued to the fucking road.

1479
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,200
I agree.

1480
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:35,681
But this one,

1481
00:38:35,681 --> 00:38:36,101
this one that's,

1482
00:38:36,101 --> 00:38:37,480
the modifications can be sick.

1483
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:40,000
I like the old school vibe
to borrow my car for a day.

1484
00:38:40,001 --> 00:38:41,470
You'll throw that other car on the trash.

1485
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,241
Your gt three.

1486
00:38:43,241 --> 00:38:43,540
Yeah.

1487
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:46,960
You'll light that 1987 shitbox on fire.

1488
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:48,380
Hey Bro,

1489
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:49,213
the dealership

1490
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:55,650
dealership fucking lows things to for
like that dad uses to start a fire on one

1491
00:38:56,951 --> 00:38:57,311
of those,

1492
00:38:57,311 --> 00:38:57,560
you know,

1493
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,220
love it.

1494
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:00,520
Or are those Coleman grills for camping?

1495
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:02,860
Squirt it all over the
car and light it on fire.

1496
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:03,281
Dude,

1497
00:39:03,281 --> 00:39:06,910
I saw someone in a brand
new gt three it was purple.

1498
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:07,721
The GT three Rs.

1499
00:39:07,721 --> 00:39:07,951
Yeah.

1500
00:39:07,951 --> 00:39:09,910
They make them fucking purple.

1501
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:10,990
Those are those cars.

1502
00:39:10,991 --> 00:39:11,920
Mass dealer.

1503
00:39:11,921 --> 00:39:12,390
So dot.

1504
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:13,051
Oh my God,

1505
00:39:13,051 --> 00:39:13,690
I'm was sick.

1506
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:16,150
They finally make it with a
manual transmission again.

1507
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:21,570
Finally the 2007 nor dean to lab side
control the 2017 so you could finally get

1508
00:39:22,211 --> 00:39:24,400
them in the manual
transmission work complaining.

1509
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:28,360
Well it's Porsche was trying too hard
to just get lap times and people were

1510
00:39:28,361 --> 00:39:31,780
pissed and they were complaining like
what the fuck does a gt three how come

1511
00:39:31,781 --> 00:39:32,680
it's a double clutch?

1512
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:34,720
Well how come I can't get it
with a manual transmission?

1513
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,380
So finally they um,

1514
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,450
they released this thing,

1515
00:39:37,451 --> 00:39:42,070
the nine 11 r which was essentially
like a gt three without the wing.

1516
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,090
Good luck getting that thing.

1517
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:46,750
People are selling them for like
half a million dollars in more.

1518
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,910
They only made how many
hundred or 911 crazy.

1519
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:53,140
They made 911 and the
light with the stripes.

1520
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:53,501
Yeah.

1521
00:39:53,501 --> 00:39:55,840
But now they're saying
that this new gt three,

1522
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:59,200
the manual one that you could actually
just buy is actually better than the nine

1523
00:39:59,201 --> 00:40:03,310
11 are cause the reason the automatics,

1524
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:04,960
the PDK is it's,

1525
00:40:04,961 --> 00:40:07,960
you know it's faster than
humans will track time.

1526
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:10,540
We can't keep up with do
you mean faster than humans?

1527
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:12,700
Like shifting stuff like that.

1528
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:17,020
The computer does computers better
track time and it's instantaneous.

1529
00:40:17,021 --> 00:40:20,620
It has two clutches so it has one clutch
that's in like say if you're in first

1530
00:40:20,621 --> 00:40:20,801
gear,

1531
00:40:20,801 --> 00:40:22,000
there's one clutches in first gear.

1532
00:40:22,001 --> 00:40:24,280
The second clutch is already
engaged in the second gear.

1533
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:25,421
So would you hit it?

1534
00:40:25,421 --> 00:40:26,260
It's instantaneous.

1535
00:40:26,261 --> 00:40:27,094
Like Bam,

1536
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:29,860
like the,

1537
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:30,970
so you don't have to shift it.

1538
00:40:30,971 --> 00:40:32,290
It takes shifting out of the gate.

1539
00:40:32,291 --> 00:40:34,840
You can have it in automatic
and it'll shift for itself.

1540
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:37,930
Or you can have it in manual and you
shift with the paddles but you don't have

1541
00:40:37,931 --> 00:40:41,020
to push the clutch in so you're
not pushing your left leg.

1542
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:43,200
That kind of takes away from the trials.

1543
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:43,560
Yeah,

1544
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,650
the fun you will find it.

1545
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:45,970
The driving feeling get automatic.

1546
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,950
I though my Porsche had those,

1547
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:52,390
the panels is lame and thinks about
computers and stuff where they,

1548
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,250
they take out the tactile
enjoyment and the,

1549
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:58,740
the timing and the human
timing and all that.

1550
00:40:58,740 --> 00:40:58,841
It,

1551
00:40:58,841 --> 00:40:59,040
it,

1552
00:40:59,040 --> 00:40:59,261
it,

1553
00:40:59,261 --> 00:41:01,050
it Kinda makes it not
that much fun anymore.

1554
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:02,860
I would imagine with your car it may,

1555
00:41:02,861 --> 00:41:06,010
it really makes a big difference
unless you're on a race track.

1556
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:09,670
Like if you're on a race track and you're
just trying to get zero to whatever,

1557
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:10,690
you know,

1558
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:12,670
zero to 60 times and make sure that your,

1559
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:14,140
your lap times are quicker,

1560
00:41:14,141 --> 00:41:16,750
then you want something
that shifts instantaneously.

1561
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:21,220
But those are also to put up numbers
cause like the new viper they see are

1562
00:41:21,221 --> 00:41:22,480
compared to the new Porsche,

1563
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:23,350
the lap times,

1564
00:41:23,351 --> 00:41:26,140
they don't wanna look bad so they
can put their best foot forward.

1565
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,960
Well the problem with the
Viper is a viper is a standard.

1566
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:30,430
It's a manual transmission,

1567
00:41:30,431 --> 00:41:32,710
but it's so fucking fast.

1568
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:33,711
It doesn't matter.

1569
00:41:33,711 --> 00:41:36,830
They bring that viper ACR
to every track and they go,

1570
00:41:36,831 --> 00:41:37,071
hey,

1571
00:41:37,071 --> 00:41:38,360
we're here to break the new track,

1572
00:41:38,361 --> 00:41:40,280
record the fuck out of the way.

1573
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:43,520
We have the most ridiculous
car America has ever built.

1574
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:45,350
It's got wings all over it.

1575
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:46,221
She's a student.

1576
00:41:46,221 --> 00:41:47,450
Whenever we talked about this,

1577
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:50,000
the same guy shoots me Dan and he's like,

1578
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:51,820
it's a picture of the viper hair.

1579
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:53,600
It is man for this price and like,

1580
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,270
oh it's like a little jarring.

1581
00:41:55,330 --> 00:41:56,870
Scott's it got Eylea so you're,

1582
00:41:56,871 --> 00:41:59,000
you're just drawn that that has no Lord.

1583
00:41:59,001 --> 00:42:04,001
I mean you're drawn to it like a huge
engine like pissy pull up viper ACR.

1584
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,410
This is do nothing for Brian.

1585
00:42:06,411 --> 00:42:06,741
Listen,

1586
00:42:06,741 --> 00:42:07,700
we're going to need this,

1587
00:42:07,701 --> 00:42:09,830
which I don't get cause you
like sleep mask and stuff.

1588
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:10,880
I like masculine stuff.

1589
00:42:10,881 --> 00:42:11,780
They got a Tesla.

1590
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:12,830
You've never driven one.

1591
00:42:12,831 --> 00:42:13,551
That's the problem.

1592
00:42:13,551 --> 00:42:14,990
You drove the testimony like Ah,

1593
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:16,310
now finally I know what it's like.

1594
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,690
It's got Kik and no lag.

1595
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,070
It doesn't even make sound.

1596
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:22,040
Don't know when this understand about lag.

1597
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,540
I don't settle for lag.

1598
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:24,360
Lag.

1599
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:24,760
Yeah.

1600
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,840
Like it's a racing term.

1601
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:29,330
I didn't know.

1602
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:29,980
Look at this car,

1603
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:33,740
Brian Callan given some
volume and look at that here.

1604
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:36,800
Then the aluminum on that
bad boy and the fence.

1605
00:42:36,801 --> 00:42:39,200
It's gotta be fiber is a guy
who knows nothing about cars.

1606
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:41,000
It's got a v 10 feet,

1607
00:42:41,001 --> 00:42:43,880
10 under three same horsepower clamps.

1608
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:45,680
Can we get some volume on this?

1609
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,390
There was no volume.

1610
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:48,980
You don't need falling any Valium?

1611
00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:50,210
Just museum.

1612
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:52,641
Why do you want volume?

1613
00:42:52,641 --> 00:42:53,410
It's just music press.

1614
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:54,390
You want to hear though?

1615
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:55,773
Whoa,

1616
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:56,990
Whoa,

1617
00:42:56,990 --> 00:42:57,890
whoa.

1618
00:42:58,790 --> 00:43:00,170
I prefer an a silent assassin.

1619
00:43:00,171 --> 00:43:01,290
I called my test site.

1620
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:02,230
The class for you be,

1621
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,193
Oh God,

1622
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:04,280
this car.

1623
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:04,731
What could this?

1624
00:43:04,731 --> 00:43:05,564
Here we go.

1625
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:10,160
You have no idea what this
is like a giant fin chuck.

1626
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:10,461
Brian,

1627
00:43:10,461 --> 00:43:12,050
you have no idea what this feels like.

1628
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:12,471
Bullshit.

1629
00:43:12,471 --> 00:43:17,120
Got To be in a car that has this
kind of power would change your life.

1630
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:18,800
No Way.

1631
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:19,011
Oh,

1632
00:43:19,011 --> 00:43:20,210
you don't understand?

1633
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,170
If you drove that thing,

1634
00:43:21,171 --> 00:43:22,370
it would change your life.

1635
00:43:22,490 --> 00:43:24,530
You'd get out of it
your hand to be sweaty.

1636
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:26,060
Your balls be tingling.

1637
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:31,200
you.car 13 times more testosterone than
when you got into the car and get that

1638
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:32,420
step left you fuckers.

1639
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:35,930
You got in that car and
then went and dead lifted.

1640
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:36,980
You'd be stronger.

1641
00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:39,860
I'm not kidding.

1642
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:40,221
That car.

1643
00:43:40,221 --> 00:43:42,970
So American America as well.

1644
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,460
And have an ego like a trans am.

1645
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:46,490
What's that?

1646
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:47,420
What's that going to cost me?

1647
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:51,410
That's 150 which is a good 263

1648
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:53,970
tremendous deal.

1649
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:55,680
You think of what the fuck that thing is?

1650
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:56,640
It does look like,

1651
00:43:56,790 --> 00:43:57,940
like if you like an ego,

1652
00:43:57,941 --> 00:43:58,980
like let's make it seconds.

1653
00:43:59,730 --> 00:43:59,851
No,

1654
00:43:59,851 --> 00:44:01,110
it looks like a snake.

1655
00:44:01,170 --> 00:44:02,670
I think they're going to discontinue it.

1656
00:44:02,671 --> 00:44:05,040
I think this is the last
year which bums me out,

1657
00:44:05,041 --> 00:44:07,260
man to the fact they're
making something like this.

1658
00:44:07,261 --> 00:44:09,030
They'd say it's so much
better than the corvette.

1659
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:11,410
We've got three minutes
and other qualified boy.

1660
00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:13,860
Well the new Corvettes are pretty bad ass,

1661
00:44:13,861 --> 00:44:15,340
but they say that once you drive this,

1662
00:44:15,341 --> 00:44:16,220
he'd go all the Corvettes.

1663
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:17,063
Trash.

1664
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:18,370
God Damn.

1665
00:44:18,370 --> 00:44:19,770
This is going to sound
like a weird thing to say.

1666
00:44:19,771 --> 00:44:21,480
A little bit like an asshole
pulling up in that though.

1667
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:24,900
I feel like an asshole
poem for my GG three na,

1668
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:25,890
but I do it.

1669
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:28,860
I parked it out front.

1670
00:44:28,861 --> 00:44:29,694
The company

1671
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:32,490
is end camp a

1672
00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:33,210
a.

1673
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:34,980
Is he a sweet Sweden?

1674
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:35,863
Yeah.

1675
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:37,140
It's going to sound weird,

1676
00:44:37,141 --> 00:44:38,250
but he's gotten bigger.

1677
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,330
As the fight progressed.

1678
00:44:39,331 --> 00:44:40,164
I feel like he's,

1679
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:42,840
I feel like he's just somehow
that this is chosen return.

1680
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:45,150
I feel like he looks like a
Swedish Wonderboy Thompson.

1681
00:44:45,170 --> 00:44:45,750
Yes he does.

1682
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:48,630
I think all the blood that's in your
Dick is fucking with your vision.

1683
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:57,870
What are you trying to say and why is
tell labs shorts had been hiked and they

1684
00:44:57,871 --> 00:44:58,860
haven't come down.

1685
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:00,800
Who wants to show us the talk?

1686
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,820
Well you can get the
different cuts be you know.

1687
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,950
Well you know that that's what
thing that Muy Thai fighters too.

1688
00:45:04,951 --> 00:45:07,230
They always pulled her
shorts up but that stayed up.

1689
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:08,093
That's interesting.

1690
00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:09,450
It's almost like glue it up at us.

1691
00:45:09,451 --> 00:45:10,260
Quad son.

1692
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:11,280
Good low kick there.

1693
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:14,310
Tell you what man and camp my,

1694
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:19,020
did you hear the rumor they're trying
to make Francisca no jds late summer.

1695
00:45:20,610 --> 00:45:21,480
Oh No.

1696
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:23,281
Oh No.

1697
00:45:23,281 --> 00:45:24,080
For who?

1698
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:26,550
What do you think JD?

1699
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:27,853
You know that song?

1700
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:29,790
I thought they were trying to jerk.

1701
00:45:29,791 --> 00:45:31,740
Lewis of Derrick Lewis gets by Mark Hunt.

1702
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:35,220
Oh he can't kill a few
to soaring young black by

1703
00:45:37,290 --> 00:45:39,000
Derrick Lewis is talking
about your shit about him.

1704
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:39,960
He called him an error.

1705
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,220
African booty scratcher.

1706
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:43,480
Scratch.

1707
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:44,131
Lewis is my,

1708
00:45:44,131 --> 00:45:46,530
one of my favorite UFC
fighter too because,

1709
00:45:46,531 --> 00:45:48,510
and not just because
of his fighting style,

1710
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:50,250
but also because of his Instagram page.

1711
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:51,061
It's hilarious.

1712
00:45:51,061 --> 00:45:52,230
Derrick Lewis has the best sense.

1713
00:45:52,231 --> 00:45:53,064
He goes hard.

1714
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,000
Hey,

1715
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,290
when he beat Travis Browne,

1716
00:45:55,470 --> 00:45:59,040
you went so hard in the
paint coming up to this girl.

1717
00:45:59,041 --> 00:46:00,330
Just also Larry.

1718
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:01,800
He's a funny fucking dude,

1719
00:46:01,801 --> 00:46:02,634
man.

1720
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,920
Some nerve talking shit to Francis,

1721
00:46:04,921 --> 00:46:06,300
the fucking terminator.

1722
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:07,860
He scares the shit out of me.

1723
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:09,600
He's so true.

1724
00:46:09,601 --> 00:46:14,601
Stories with braids that let's not
get too crazy in Chicago with brains.

1725
00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:16,530
Right for me right now.

1726
00:46:16,531 --> 00:46:16,761
No,

1727
00:46:16,761 --> 00:46:17,030
no,

1728
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:17,271
no,

1729
00:46:17,271 --> 00:46:17,610
no,

1730
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:17,881
no,

1731
00:46:17,881 --> 00:46:18,150
no,

1732
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:18,391
no,

1733
00:46:18,391 --> 00:46:18,691
no.

1734
00:46:18,691 --> 00:46:18,891
You're,

1735
00:46:18,891 --> 00:46:19,740
you're on this bullshit.

1736
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:20,370
No,

1737
00:46:20,370 --> 00:46:20,560
no,

1738
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:20,880
no.

1739
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:21,870
He's on another level.

1740
00:46:21,871 --> 00:46:22,650
Who's he beat?

1741
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:23,970
How's going to beat our last game?

1742
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:25,650
It's just not who we beats.

1743
00:46:25,651 --> 00:46:28,050
He how he beat some dude.

1744
00:46:28,051 --> 00:46:29,070
He's so big.

1745
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:32,070
You don't understand like check Congo
was a bad motherfucker in his day,

1746
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:35,130
but check Congo wasn't
starching people the way.

1747
00:46:35,131 --> 00:46:38,010
God No is he did when he
first burst on the scene.

1748
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:38,730
People Forget.

1749
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:42,870
We get on these type down pat Barry
in a crazy wild slug fest when he was

1750
00:46:42,871 --> 00:46:43,704
already hurt.

1751
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:44,371
You know what I mean?

1752
00:46:44,371 --> 00:46:46,020
That was a super impressive victory.

1753
00:46:46,830 --> 00:46:49,640
He's got some good and some
good victory Kongo fight.

1754
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:50,483
Roy Nelson.

1755
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:51,440
Yes.

1756
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,070
Roy Nelson knocked him the fuck out.

1757
00:46:53,071 --> 00:46:54,000
That's a bad example.

1758
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:55,293
There's a whole week.

1759
00:46:55,590 --> 00:46:56,190
Do you ride?

1760
00:46:56,190 --> 00:46:57,120
It was just like this.

1761
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:58,433
Roy.

1762
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,750
Roy knocked out a lot of fun to it.

1763
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:05,800
Now do you think Roy Mitrione rematch
and Belgium drone tweeted today?

1764
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:06,691
Hey,

1765
00:47:06,691 --> 00:47:10,620
how bout we fight after I get through
fate or like you better focus on fate or

1766
00:47:10,621 --> 00:47:11,250
Matt.

1767
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:11,491
Yeah.

1768
00:47:11,491 --> 00:47:11,940
Jesus.

1769
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:12,300
Hey,

1770
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:12,901
real quick.

1771
00:47:12,901 --> 00:47:14,040
Roy Fade or fight.

1772
00:47:17,310 --> 00:47:20,460
Surprise had on dad who won this fight.

1773
00:47:20,461 --> 00:47:20,851
I wonder,

1774
00:47:20,851 --> 00:47:21,210
this is,

1775
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:22,021
this is interesting.

1776
00:47:22,021 --> 00:47:24,890
We're just doing at the viper
now I'm talking about France,

1777
00:47:24,910 --> 00:47:26,000
you know,

1778
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:28,170
to soaring.

1779
00:47:28,171 --> 00:47:29,550
You don't understand why

1780
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:34,120
the idea that a viper is
a stimulating experience.

1781
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:34,780
Yeah.

1782
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:37,330
I have no experience
with those kinds of cars.

1783
00:47:37,331 --> 00:47:38,410
You haven't been in my test,

1784
00:47:38,411 --> 00:47:41,500
so when I've opened her up did I have a
bit of driven tests now feel about that

1785
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:42,473
very fast.

1786
00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:43,270
I like them.

1787
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:43,560
Yeah.

1788
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:44,470
Greg do not.

1789
00:47:44,471 --> 00:47:45,210
I just don't like,

1790
00:47:45,210 --> 00:47:47,620
I don't like the fact that they
run out of batteries quick.

1791
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:47,880
Yeah.

1792
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:50,950
I don't like the fact that Sam
Harris has left him stranded twice.

1793
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:52,083
That's weird.

1794
00:47:52,090 --> 00:47:52,680
It's not weird.

1795
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:55,870
I think for a guy who's not a car guy
like me who doesn't get off on the,

1796
00:47:55,871 --> 00:47:56,630
my mom,

1797
00:47:56,630 --> 00:47:57,310
you know,

1798
00:47:57,310 --> 00:48:02,050
I liked that I don't have to go to a
gas station and got more issues charging

1799
00:48:02,051 --> 00:48:02,531
like you're like,

1800
00:48:02,531 --> 00:48:02,711
God,

1801
00:48:02,711 --> 00:48:04,030
I got to find somewhere to charge.

1802
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:05,770
It is an issue all the time.

1803
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:06,480
He'll be like,

1804
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:07,700
let me draw your a scatterbrain.

1805
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:10,720
You'll probably want those guys
doesn't charge car for you.

1806
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:11,200
Yeah.

1807
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,130
That's not a car scattered.

1808
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:12,410
Right?

1809
00:48:12,410 --> 00:48:14,160
Like there's a gas station everywhere.

1810
00:48:14,490 --> 00:48:14,910
Yeah.

1811
00:48:14,910 --> 00:48:17,140
When you charge at my house.

1812
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:17,950
That's it.

1813
00:48:17,950 --> 00:48:18,101
Yeah.

1814
00:48:18,101 --> 00:48:18,880
You just plug it in.

1815
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:19,740
There's superchargers.

1816
00:48:19,890 --> 00:48:20,723
Supercharged,

1817
00:48:20,830 --> 00:48:21,550
supercharged,

1818
00:48:21,550 --> 00:48:22,700
but good luck finding him safely.

1819
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:23,980
Drive the Improv and you're like,

1820
00:48:23,981 --> 00:48:24,401
fuck,

1821
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:25,061
I need to charge.

1822
00:48:25,061 --> 00:48:25,720
What do you do?

1823
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:26,531
You've got some issues.

1824
00:48:26,531 --> 00:48:26,671
I,

1825
00:48:26,671 --> 00:48:27,011
I've,

1826
00:48:27,011 --> 00:48:29,080
I've call up a rich made it to my,

1827
00:48:29,081 --> 00:48:31,750
I've made it to my
driveway with zero battery.

1828
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:32,670
Zero,

1829
00:48:32,670 --> 00:48:34,150
like literally zero where I was.

1830
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:35,340
Well that's not as hard as us.

1831
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:35,801
No,

1832
00:48:35,801 --> 00:48:37,030
it's terrible though.

1833
00:48:37,031 --> 00:48:37,380
Like I,

1834
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:41,320
I drove to Irvine and then I realized
halfway back from Irvine or I'm going to

1835
00:48:41,321 --> 00:48:43,030
be June 8th and ninth and 10th,

1836
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:43,660
uh,

1837
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:45,640
where I realized halfway
through that I was done.

1838
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:46,180
Like I was,

1839
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:49,860
I was not going to make it back
so I had to stop and charge it.

1840
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:51,290
And then how long do we
have to wait to charge?

1841
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:52,133
Takes forever.

1842
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:54,070
If you don't have a supercharger,

1843
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:54,401
you're,

1844
00:48:54,401 --> 00:48:54,941
you're like,

1845
00:48:54,941 --> 00:48:56,200
those charges they have in,

1846
00:48:56,470 --> 00:48:59,770
in garages are complete
bullshit for an hour you'll get,

1847
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:00,730
you know,

1848
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:01,563
18 miles.

1849
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:04,030
Those ones you can stop by
on the road or be struggling.

1850
00:49:04,070 --> 00:49:04,211
Yeah,

1851
00:49:04,211 --> 00:49:05,044
those are great.

1852
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:06,011
Those and a half hour.

1853
00:49:06,011 --> 00:49:06,430
You're good.

1854
00:49:06,430 --> 00:49:08,710
Where are those were all over?

1855
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:09,910
Not really all over yet,

1856
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:11,110
but I will say this,

1857
00:49:11,170 --> 00:49:12,490
that they're trying,

1858
00:49:12,530 --> 00:49:12,960
uh,

1859
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:16,210
Tesla's trying to get up stations
where you can go in and they switch her

1860
00:49:16,211 --> 00:49:17,080
battery out right there.

1861
00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:17,600
Let's see.

1862
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:20,110
Guess who want to lead I think.

1863
00:49:20,170 --> 00:49:22,320
I think probably to leave the,

1864
00:49:22,390 --> 00:49:23,830
we're going to come
down to the third round.

1865
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:27,670
Boy they're going hard with this thing
because he was on telling you that shit

1866
00:49:27,671 --> 00:49:28,510
is so depressing.

1867
00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:29,890
What's that logo?

1868
00:49:29,891 --> 00:49:32,500
Get the fuck out of my face
with the ads are brutal.

1869
00:49:32,730 --> 00:49:37,300
Those shows me in the UFC when a fight
starts and they have to do an nor dean to

1870
00:49:37,301 --> 00:49:41,040
let won the fight starts and they
have to do an ad while the fight.

1871
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:42,070
Yeah.

1872
00:49:42,070 --> 00:49:45,370
That shit drives me to 11
brought to you by alien.

1873
00:49:45,430 --> 00:49:47,090
It drives me crazy is no,

1874
00:49:47,091 --> 00:49:48,220
this is very swollen right now.

1875
00:49:48,490 --> 00:49:51,600
There you got to hit so you
got punched in the nose be Yup.

1876
00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:52,701
Dan Hardy.

1877
00:49:52,701 --> 00:49:55,280
He's still talking about coming back
cause I know he was talking about it for a

1878
00:49:55,281 --> 00:49:55,780
while there.

1879
00:49:55,780 --> 00:50:00,610
If they could figure out some
way to let it come to this team,

1880
00:50:00,611 --> 00:50:02,050
this English comm team team.

1881
00:50:02,051 --> 00:50:03,430
I really liked these guys.

1882
00:50:03,610 --> 00:50:07,510
I never hear them because we're always
doing this but I'm sure Dan's excellent.

1883
00:50:09,450 --> 00:50:11,050
It's fucking brilliant.

1884
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:11,913
He's really good.

1885
00:50:11,950 --> 00:50:16,300
I worked with those guys way back in the
day when I was doing shows in England

1886
00:50:16,301 --> 00:50:17,590
and they were just sort of like,

1887
00:50:17,870 --> 00:50:21,040
they tried out for a while
before they actually did it.

1888
00:50:21,490 --> 00:50:21,761
You know,

1889
00:50:21,761 --> 00:50:22,421
there was some,

1890
00:50:22,421 --> 00:50:23,254
um,

1891
00:50:23,290 --> 00:50:24,930
some testing that they did.

1892
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:25,080
Oh,

1893
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:26,110
that's a nice check left,

1894
00:50:26,111 --> 00:50:26,410
right,

1895
00:50:26,410 --> 00:50:27,243
left hook.

1896
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:27,891
They,

1897
00:50:27,891 --> 00:50:28,280
uh,

1898
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:29,960
it's a different vibe than you guys.

1899
00:50:29,961 --> 00:50:30,771
They really talk,

1900
00:50:30,771 --> 00:50:30,950
you know,

1901
00:50:30,950 --> 00:50:32,960
they're talking about talking
to the fighters the week of,

1902
00:50:32,990 --> 00:50:34,370
they sticked a lot of that,

1903
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:35,633
you know?

1904
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:36,681
Yeah.

1905
00:50:36,681 --> 00:50:38,180
Everybody's got their own style.

1906
00:50:38,850 --> 00:50:40,720
That's so interesting thing about Kotlin.

1907
00:50:40,730 --> 00:50:42,200
He's also gust weird style.

1908
00:50:42,201 --> 00:50:43,034
The Way He dresses,

1909
00:50:43,450 --> 00:50:44,810
I think it's on some 1970.

1910
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:46,160
That's a checklist.

1911
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:46,431
Shit.

1912
00:50:46,431 --> 00:50:46,700
Boy,

1913
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:48,350
that shit suit he's wearing.

1914
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:49,213
I'm not mad at you.

1915
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:50,420
I'm not mad at it.

1916
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,100
Completely different
than your goals would.

1917
00:50:52,101 --> 00:50:53,000
That checkered pattern,

1918
00:50:53,001 --> 00:50:54,290
what does that called look at it?

1919
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:54,830
I didn't see it.

1920
00:50:54,830 --> 00:50:55,400
Oh,

1921
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:56,990
the plan is that plaid?

1922
00:50:57,050 --> 00:50:57,883
Yeah.

1923
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:04,460
Nordine or you brought up the Tesla
for superchargers in like all of them

1924
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:12,140
that they should have a 24 hour with white
p number that you can call if you get

1925
00:51:12,141 --> 00:51:13,820
stuck somewhere with white people.

1926
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:14,930
Let's be real.

1927
00:51:14,930 --> 00:51:15,351
Who Buys?

1928
00:51:15,351 --> 00:51:16,990
Tesla's the only black Friday.

1929
00:51:16,991 --> 00:51:17,750
Kind of like me.

1930
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:19,250
The only black guys that drive Teslas,

1931
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,240
they're the same black eyes.

1932
00:51:20,241 --> 00:51:23,510
They keep their cell phone on the
outside of their shirt with a belt hook.

1933
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:27,093
Yeah.

1934
00:51:28,010 --> 00:51:30,440
You Shop Channel Super Tech?

1935
00:51:30,690 --> 00:51:31,523
No,

1936
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:32,853
no,

1937
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:33,480
no.

1938
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:35,120
The rare black guy that drinks tea.

1939
00:51:35,270 --> 00:51:35,930
Any products?

1940
00:51:35,930 --> 00:51:36,110
Sure.

1941
00:51:36,110 --> 00:51:39,830
It still keeps one of those
Bluetooth ear pieces in those ones.

1942
00:51:40,010 --> 00:51:43,160
The blue light on it
has a lightweight fuck.

1943
00:51:43,330 --> 00:51:44,390
Has that belt clip.

1944
00:51:45,090 --> 00:51:47,390
Fuck fuck you.

1945
00:51:47,450 --> 00:51:49,940
Do you still do you still wear
a fanny pack all the time,

1946
00:51:49,941 --> 00:51:50,774
bitch.

1947
00:51:51,290 --> 00:51:52,370
I would never wear one.

1948
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:53,720
I would want to to run.

1949
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:54,830
I sent Joel Pizza.

1950
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:56,360
It looks strong.

1951
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:58,130
I have three different ones
that I wear for running.

1952
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:58,930
That's impressive.

1953
00:51:58,930 --> 00:52:00,170
Preme ones with zippers.

1954
00:52:00,171 --> 00:52:00,790
Yeah.

1955
00:52:00,790 --> 00:52:01,623
Yeah.

1956
00:52:02,090 --> 00:52:03,290
Those are good to keep it tight,

1957
00:52:03,470 --> 00:52:04,430
but they're not good enough for me.

1958
00:52:04,431 --> 00:52:05,031
When I travel,

1959
00:52:05,031 --> 00:52:05,571
when I travel,

1960
00:52:05,571 --> 00:52:08,270
I need the official
hire primate fanny pack.

1961
00:52:08,271 --> 00:52:09,104
It's large.

1962
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:13,400
[inaudible] cause my running one doesn't
say tiny like flops around to fucking

1963
00:52:13,401 --> 00:52:13,970
annoying.

1964
00:52:13,970 --> 00:52:14,960
Oh you got to get a better one.

1965
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:16,150
I got some good running ones.

1966
00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:17,450
Mine say tide is fun.

1967
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:18,080
Yeah,

1968
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:18,913
I need one.

1969
00:52:19,190 --> 00:52:20,570
It's just called the running belt.

1970
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:21,400
I love it.

1971
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:23,950
Let a handsome Bannister
who's got a Hoodie on deck.

1972
00:52:24,630 --> 00:52:25,820
We got a fighter in the kid hoodie.

1973
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,350
That's the Abbot Kinney Fighter Hoodie,

1974
00:52:27,370 --> 00:52:27,800
right?

1975
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:28,633
That's right.

1976
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:29,533
Represent man.

1977
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:32,720
I'm surprised the UFC like
get back that shit up Jamie.

1978
00:52:32,721 --> 00:52:33,261
Show him.

1979
00:52:33,261 --> 00:52:33,800
Show him.

1980
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:34,270
Yeah,

1981
00:52:34,270 --> 00:52:34,960
he can't.

1982
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:35,990
Oh Kiss live TV.

1983
00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:38,570

regional show his own product.

1985
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:45,380
What happened to action
showing you I'm wearing now.

1986
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:47,330
You're sure man in our shit.

1987
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:48,140
Yeah.

1988
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:49,060
You fucking pill.

1989
00:52:49,290 --> 00:52:51,300
Do you want to like buy our stuff?

1990
00:52:53,990 --> 00:52:54,201
Yeah.

1991
00:52:54,201 --> 00:52:55,570
You only need to go like one.

1992
00:52:56,820 --> 00:52:57,653
Yeah.

1993
00:52:57,670 --> 00:52:58,200
Hmm.

1994
00:52:58,200 --> 00:52:59,310
What happened when you do these Joe,

1995
00:52:59,311 --> 00:52:59,700
do you don't,

1996
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:00,420
you don't matter.

1997
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:01,530
The studio here in la?

1998
00:53:01,830 --> 00:53:02,280
Yeah.

1999
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:03,870
So you don't have to
obviously go anywhere.

2000
00:53:03,990 --> 00:53:04,441
Oh yeah.

2001
00:53:04,441 --> 00:53:04,711
Yeah.

2002
00:53:04,711 --> 00:53:05,544
Not going anywhere.

2003
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:06,060
This.

2004
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:06,781
Let me tell you something,

2005
00:53:06,781 --> 00:53:07,080
man.

2006
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:09,660
This is like one of the hardest
things that I do is these,

2007
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:11,130
when these fight breakdowns,

2008
00:53:11,610 --> 00:53:12,443
because uh,

2009
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:13,650
you ready do some homework?

2010
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:15,690
I not only have to do some homework,

2011
00:53:15,691 --> 00:53:17,340
but I do them.

2012
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:20,670
I'm writing them and performing them live.

2013
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:22,500
Like there's no script.

2014
00:53:22,670 --> 00:53:24,760
Like I have zero script areas like that.

2015
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,940
A strong fighter and the kid Hoodie,

2016
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:27,810
look at that camera.

2017
00:53:27,811 --> 00:53:28,830
That's right baby.

2018
00:53:28,831 --> 00:53:29,700
You can hunt with it.

2019
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,760
You can disappear and fully
ready to your spine on your ex.

2020
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:33,720
Shit.

2021
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:35,070
You really don't want to hunt in cotton,

2022
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:35,913
but,

2023
00:53:35,970 --> 00:53:36,151
well,

2024
00:53:36,151 --> 00:53:36,984
you know what I mean?

2025
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:37,993
It looks good.

2026
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:40,830
We're releasing the hunter
additional pure wool.

2027
00:53:41,070 --> 00:53:43,890
Well you need to get in with first light
and have them make a fighter and the

2028
00:53:43,891 --> 00:53:44,830
kid version.

2029
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:49,740
Remember wearing wool like when we were
wet and how you could be wet in Alaska

2030
00:53:49,741 --> 00:53:50,521
and it was called,

2031
00:53:50,521 --> 00:53:51,241
but you'd be in the morning,

2032
00:53:51,241 --> 00:53:51,811
you'd be cold,

2033
00:53:51,811 --> 00:53:55,740
but you'd put on wet wool
and you kept you warm.

2034
00:53:55,770 --> 00:53:55,951
Yeah.

2035
00:53:55,951 --> 00:53:56,680
It's crazy.

2036
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:56,930
Yeah.

2037
00:53:56,930 --> 00:53:58,350
Do I want to see Rina?

2038
00:53:58,650 --> 00:53:59,483
Yes.

2039
00:53:59,490 --> 00:54:00,323
That's the fight.

2040
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:03,720
I feel like I want rose to
have a year or two more.

2041
00:54:03,721 --> 00:54:04,180
Man.

2042
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:05,780
That's the way it works.

2043
00:54:05,790 --> 00:54:07,360
I know the problems.

2044
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:09,630
She's beat Claudia twice now.

2045
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:11,670
Carolino no,

2046
00:54:11,671 --> 00:54:12,570
she lost Carolina.

2047
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:14,250
That's how Carol Lena got the fight.

2048
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:15,740
Who did roasted,

2049
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:15,901
oh,

2050
00:54:15,901 --> 00:54:16,830
not saying Yolana.

2051
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:17,370
Oh yeah,

2052
00:54:17,370 --> 00:54:17,820
yeah,

2053
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:18,420
yeah.

2054
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:19,650
She'd be Claudia twice.

2055
00:54:19,651 --> 00:54:20,820
She beat Carolina.

2056
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:21,713
Should beat just gone.

2057
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:25,770
Jessica and trust Jesus Christ as
Jessica and tries to have a fucking chin.

2058
00:54:26,190 --> 00:54:29,540
That chick is so tough and
they were sending me there,

2059
00:54:29,570 --> 00:54:30,403
honey.

2060
00:54:32,410 --> 00:54:33,390
I'll take an shutout out.

2061
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:33,571
Well,

2062
00:54:33,571 --> 00:54:34,800
well she is a tank.

2063
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:35,111
I see.

2064
00:54:35,111 --> 00:54:38,460
I wouldn't see my auntie
and her and rose Rose A.

2065
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:39,001
Little more warm up,

2066
00:54:39,001 --> 00:54:39,960
but that's not the way it works.

2067
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:41,260
There's nothing left for you on that.

2068
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:43,500
I know that there really
is nothing left for,

2069
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:46,380
I mean after rose
dismantled the karate hottie

2070
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:49,760
mantle that didn't think
that was going to happen.

2071
00:54:49,761 --> 00:54:50,880
Paid kick to choke.

2072
00:54:50,881 --> 00:54:51,714
Whoa.

2073
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:52,800
Good Lord.

2074
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:53,521
Good Lord.

2075
00:54:53,521 --> 00:54:57,600
I think rose has real legitimate
world championship possibilities.

2076
00:54:57,630 --> 00:54:58,051
Hello,

2077
00:54:58,051 --> 00:54:58,770
which is,

2078
00:54:58,770 --> 00:55:00,030
I would just like to see her.

2079
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:00,271
I mean,

2080
00:55:00,271 --> 00:55:00,691
look man,

2081
00:55:00,691 --> 00:55:00,841
I'm,

2082
00:55:00,841 --> 00:55:01,471
I might be wrong.

2083
00:55:01,471 --> 00:55:02,670
She might go in there and get her.

2084
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:03,830
She might get you on.

2085
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:06,990
The thing about rose that you can't
count out and she's dangerous.

2086
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:10,380
She's more explosive and like more
dynamic than any girl out there I think.

2087
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:12,173
Wow.

2088
00:55:12,270 --> 00:55:13,410
She's so athletic.

2089
00:55:13,411 --> 00:55:15,260
You told me you freak athletic when,

2090
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:18,060
cause we were training together
at grudge and man freak freak.

2091
00:55:18,630 --> 00:55:20,450
You ever see her do flying armbars yeah,

2092
00:55:20,690 --> 00:55:22,290
she's had it been in fights.

2093
00:55:22,890 --> 00:55:23,723
It's crazy.

2094
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:24,060
Yeah.

2095
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:26,010
The girl can hit a flying
arm bar in a fight.

2096
00:55:26,510 --> 00:55:29,340
She has x factor that
Yolanda hasn't seen yet,

2097
00:55:29,370 --> 00:55:32,970
but if that doesn't happen
for golden is a scary,

2098
00:55:32,971 --> 00:55:35,010
scary woman striking.

2099
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,770
Would you say it's the best
and you'll see it as an just,

2100
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:39,000
just flat out right?

2101
00:55:39,001 --> 00:55:40,110
Like tech technical.

2102
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:41,370
Wow.

2103
00:55:41,370 --> 00:55:43,710
I mean it's definitely
the best and women's MMA,

2104
00:55:43,950 --> 00:55:48,660
but it's not like she doesn't have the
brutal knockout power that like cyborg

2105
00:55:48,661 --> 00:55:49,350
house,

2106
00:55:49,350 --> 00:55:53,100
which she has is like excellent
technique like over and over again.

2107
00:55:53,101 --> 00:55:55,320
She's using perfect
technique and footwork,

2108
00:55:55,650 --> 00:55:56,321
but she,

2109
00:55:56,321 --> 00:55:58,830
she needs a volume of
punches to get people out.

2110
00:55:59,010 --> 00:56:00,240
She's not a big person.

2111
00:56:00,270 --> 00:56:01,530
Like she has small hands.

2112
00:56:01,531 --> 00:56:02,390
She has small feet,

2113
00:56:02,391 --> 00:56:03,450
just small bones.

2114
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:04,613
She's not like,

2115
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:06,270
like in the Jessica and drives fights.

2116
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:11,190
Perfect example on drudge was so scary
and every punchy throws us like she's

2117
00:56:11,191 --> 00:56:11,491
strong,

2118
00:56:11,491 --> 00:56:12,660
these fucking bombs.

2119
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:15,450
Whereas you want us just
picking at it on that technique.

2120
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:17,230
She's so much more technical,

2121
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:21,880
more she wasn't stopping in any way on
drugs is kind of constant assaulting

2122
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:22,650
pounds.

2123
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:23,110
Yeah.

2124
00:56:23,110 --> 00:56:25,100
Literally 150 pound female fight.

2125
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:27,130
You can fight differently too.

2126
00:56:27,131 --> 00:56:27,371
Right?

2127
00:56:27,371 --> 00:56:27,521
I mean,

2128
00:56:27,521 --> 00:56:29,230
obviously you can be more technical,

2129
00:56:29,231 --> 00:56:31,330
whereas if you're fighting
somebody technical,

2130
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:32,173
I mean,

2131
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:33,251
there's a lot of technique,

2132
00:56:33,251 --> 00:56:38,110
but I'm saying I feel like when you
would pay very dearly for one shot from

2133
00:56:38,111 --> 00:56:38,944
somebody who's bigger,

2134
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:40,480
you almost have to fight differently.

2135
00:56:40,481 --> 00:56:40,900
Right?

2136
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:41,231
Yeah.

2137
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:41,830
For sure.

2138
00:56:41,830 --> 00:56:42,250
Yeah.

2139
00:56:42,250 --> 00:56:42,431
Yeah.

2140
00:56:42,431 --> 00:56:42,911
If you're fighting,

2141
00:56:42,911 --> 00:56:44,590
mighty mouse is more technical than,

2142
00:56:44,591 --> 00:56:44,830
yeah.

2143
00:56:44,830 --> 00:56:45,190
You know?

2144
00:56:45,190 --> 00:56:45,730
Yeah.

2145
00:56:45,730 --> 00:56:46,720
Anybody really?

2146
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:47,470
How about him?

2147
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:48,490
Tj Ain't happening.

2148
00:56:49,090 --> 00:56:50,210
It's that TJC.

2149
00:56:50,230 --> 00:56:50,561
I'm like,

2150
00:56:50,561 --> 00:56:50,741
no,

2151
00:56:50,741 --> 00:56:51,574
you've got to pay me.

2152
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:53,770
And you know I love Tj.

2153
00:56:53,770 --> 00:56:55,900
I know you probably listening for Dj,

2154
00:56:55,901 --> 00:56:58,480
it doesn't make sense for
mighty mouse mighty mouse.

2155
00:56:58,481 --> 00:56:59,730
It does not make any slots.

2156
00:56:59,770 --> 00:57:01,630
Why teachers don't even have the belt.

2157
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:02,980
It's not as super fight.

2158
00:57:03,010 --> 00:57:03,340
He wouldn't,

2159
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:05,590
I'm super fights equal
super money and when it,

2160
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:09,510
when it's not a needle mover unfortunately
as I would love to see the fights of

2161
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:10,360
ridiculous fight.

2162
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:11,141
So what is a,

2163
00:57:11,141 --> 00:57:12,330
has mighty mouse had no to it.

2164
00:57:12,331 --> 00:57:13,960
Is that what it straight up
was like ain't happening.

2165
00:57:14,350 --> 00:57:14,690
Wow.

2166
00:57:14,690 --> 00:57:15,660
The UFC wants it happened.

2167
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:15,851
He's like,

2168
00:57:15,851 --> 00:57:15,971
no,

2169
00:57:15,971 --> 00:57:16,510
I'm good.

2170
00:57:16,510 --> 00:57:17,343
It ain't happening.

2171
00:57:17,470 --> 00:57:18,120
Ray Boards,

2172
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:21,460
the next contender isn't that interesting
that that he can make those calls too.

2173
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:23,350
I mean it's one of those weird things.

2174
00:57:23,351 --> 00:57:24,490
It's like in boxing,

2175
00:57:24,491 --> 00:57:28,000
you know you have mandatory
challengers and then you know,

2176
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:31,420
then you try to make
super fights in the UFC.

2177
00:57:31,421 --> 00:57:32,111
It's like they're like,

2178
00:57:32,111 --> 00:57:32,471
hey,

2179
00:57:32,471 --> 00:57:33,550
we've got to fight for you.

2180
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:34,060
And he's like,

2181
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:34,480
hmm,

2182
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:35,313
I'm the champ.

2183
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:35,860
Well,

2184
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:36,491
but it's rare,

2185
00:57:36,491 --> 00:57:36,791
right?

2186
00:57:36,791 --> 00:57:38,530
Like if you only have one title defense,

2187
00:57:38,970 --> 00:57:41,800
you better get the fuck up
then and played played with us.

2188
00:57:41,830 --> 00:57:42,663
You know what I'm saying?

2189
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:47,260
It's a cluster fuck because right now
like you have to order like I'm all about

2190
00:57:47,261 --> 00:57:47,771
super fights.

2191
00:57:47,771 --> 00:57:48,581
We have to have order.

2192
00:57:48,581 --> 00:57:49,414
Otherwise,

2193
00:57:49,450 --> 00:57:49,661
you know,

2194
00:57:49,661 --> 00:57:51,250
think about if Tj went down there,

2195
00:57:51,251 --> 00:57:54,160
then what happened with the Cody
Garbrandt fight lemons with Dj.

2196
00:57:54,390 --> 00:57:54,911
You know what I'm saying?

2197
00:57:54,911 --> 00:57:57,790
But this Conor McGregor
kind of phenomenon,

2198
00:57:57,820 --> 00:57:58,780
everyone's trying to do it.

2199
00:57:58,930 --> 00:57:59,763
Yeah.

2200
00:57:59,890 --> 00:58:04,120
Well I think TJ just went through
a huge camp and he wants a fight,

2201
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:04,781
you know,

2202
00:58:04,781 --> 00:58:05,561
I mean he's,

2203
00:58:05,561 --> 00:58:07,900
he's gone through this giant
camp getting ready for Cody.

2204
00:58:07,910 --> 00:58:08,743
I get it.

2205
00:58:09,010 --> 00:58:09,610
And you know,

2206
00:58:09,610 --> 00:58:10,151
Cody,

2207
00:58:10,151 --> 00:58:11,570
they were trying to pressure him to fight.

2208
00:58:11,571 --> 00:58:11,980
He,

2209
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:12,950
they even sent him down.

2210
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,950
I don't why I sent him down to Germany,

2211
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:18,190
Germany to get the same shit
you can get in Santa Monica.

2212
00:58:18,190 --> 00:58:19,000
How weird is that?

2213
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:19,121
Well,

2214
00:58:19,121 --> 00:58:22,000
Dana doesn't believe that it's the
same and I don't understand that.

2215
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:22,721
So,

2216
00:58:22,721 --> 00:58:23,201
so what,

2217
00:58:23,201 --> 00:58:24,460
what is wrong with Cody?

2218
00:58:24,461 --> 00:58:25,300
He's got [inaudible].

2219
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:25,760
Yeah,

2220
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:26,740
he's got a back issue.

2221
00:58:27,130 --> 00:58:31,270
What is it do we know he's got something
was disk and he needs time off.

2222
00:58:31,271 --> 00:58:35,440
He needs spinal decompression and he's
got the Regeneca and he went and got a

2223
00:58:35,441 --> 00:58:36,220
full treatment.

2224
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:37,600
They say it'd be ready by September.

2225
00:58:37,601 --> 00:58:38,210
October.

2226
00:58:38,210 --> 00:58:38,500
Yeah.

2227
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:39,580
Got a weight maybe.

2228
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:42,190
But you have to absolutely
make sure it heals.

2229
00:58:42,191 --> 00:58:43,024
First.

2230
00:58:43,030 --> 00:58:44,440
I sent him a bunch of information.

2231
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:45,071
I sent him,

2232
00:58:45,071 --> 00:58:45,580
um,

2233
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:46,080
the,

2234
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:46,420
uh,

2235
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:48,070
reverse hyper machine,

2236
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:51,960
send them some stuff on
spinal decompression and uh,

2237
00:58:51,970 --> 00:58:53,920
he's also talking to Dr. Davidson,

2238
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:56,880
who they're starting to
do some stuff and yeah,

2239
00:58:56,881 --> 00:58:57,160
he's,

2240
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:57,993
he's brilliant.

2241
00:58:58,150 --> 00:59:01,330
They're starting to do some
stuff now in the UFC where there,

2242
00:59:01,331 --> 00:59:01,960
um,

2243
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:06,960
the stem cell doctors are now going to
inject stem cells into discs and they're

2244
00:59:07,271 --> 00:59:09,130
going to regenerate disc tissue.

2245
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:09,910
That's cool.

2246
00:59:09,910 --> 00:59:10,743
That's amazing.

2247
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:11,890
This is the first time.

2248
00:59:11,910 --> 00:59:12,310
Yes,

2249
00:59:12,310 --> 00:59:12,730
yes.

2250
00:59:12,730 --> 00:59:13,270
Oh yeah.

2251
00:59:13,270 --> 00:59:14,103
Yeah.

2252
00:59:14,230 --> 00:59:15,160
They've got shit.

2253
00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:19,060
They've got studies that they've done
enough of them now that they have some

2254
00:59:19,061 --> 00:59:21,040
real good evidence that
it does regenerate.

2255
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:23,330
Same way it regenerates
cartilage and ligaments and,

2256
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:25,280
but there's a lot of times
with the injuries where,

2257
00:59:25,281 --> 00:59:25,521
you know,

2258
00:59:25,521 --> 00:59:27,950
sometimes that's not going to be enough.

2259
00:59:28,130 --> 00:59:28,461
You're right.

2260
00:59:28,461 --> 00:59:29,330
It depends on the injury.

2261
00:59:29,331 --> 00:59:30,500
A lot of times those stem cells,

2262
00:59:30,790 --> 00:59:35,390
it's just sometimes you fuck a lot of
that is that there hasn't been that much

2263
00:59:35,391 --> 00:59:36,224
conclusive evidence,

2264
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:36,681
for example,

2265
00:59:36,681 --> 00:59:41,000
that it grows and when you shoot it into
something I've Koby Bryant would beg to

2266
00:59:41,001 --> 00:59:44,880
differ necessarily regenerate
sometimes you know,

2267
00:59:44,930 --> 00:59:45,351
or a lot,

2268
00:59:45,351 --> 00:59:46,420
well it's,

2269
00:59:46,421 --> 00:59:50,040
it's very difficult to say why it works
on some people and why it doesn't work

2270
00:59:50,041 --> 00:59:50,571
on other people.

2271
00:59:50,571 --> 00:59:51,760
But I think it's one of these,

2272
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:52,020
yeah,

2273
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:52,610
case by case.

2274
00:59:52,610 --> 00:59:56,540
But I think one factor is whether or not
you come back too quick and that's what

2275
00:59:56,690 --> 00:59:57,560
would Cody did.

2276
00:59:57,590 --> 01:00:00,620
Cody got the stem cells and then started
working out like four days later.

2277
01:00:00,710 --> 01:00:01,510
I keep,

2278
01:00:01,510 --> 01:00:02,271
you can't do that.

2279
01:00:02,271 --> 01:00:03,020
That's not smart.

2280
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:03,770
You can't do that.

2281
01:00:03,770 --> 01:00:04,071
I mean,

2282
01:00:04,071 --> 01:00:04,761
you know like look,

2283
01:00:04,761 --> 01:00:05,510
he's got a fight,

2284
01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:07,920
he's got a big title fight and you,

2285
01:00:07,921 --> 01:00:08,210
you,

2286
01:00:08,210 --> 01:00:10,190
I think actually it took two
weeks off or something like that.

2287
01:00:10,191 --> 01:00:12,350
But you need like months and
he had a lot of time off.

2288
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:13,850
You need to have your body heal.

2289
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:18,880
It's a very difficult area to heal and
a lot of people don't do it correctly.

2290
01:00:19,341 --> 01:00:23,570
And then they wind up getting some serious
atrophy where the nerves get pinched,

2291
01:00:23,571 --> 01:00:26,870
the swelling and all the inflammation
and Cody needs to take it slow,

2292
01:00:26,871 --> 01:00:29,210
come back and in that TJ fly to be there.

2293
01:00:29,210 --> 01:00:30,470
But you can't rush that fight.

2294
01:00:30,830 --> 01:00:31,521
We'll look at Eddie.

2295
01:00:31,521 --> 01:00:33,140
I mean Eddie Bravo is a,

2296
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:34,940
he has a fake disc in his back down.

2297
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:35,780
I mean,

2298
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:36,620
I shouldn't say fake.

2299
01:00:36,621 --> 01:00:38,120
It's artificial.

2300
01:00:38,450 --> 01:00:43,370
It's a titanium articulating disc that
he had put into his back because of this.

2301
01:00:43,590 --> 01:00:44,450
The same issue,

2302
01:00:44,451 --> 01:00:45,920
like disc degeneration,

2303
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:48,620
having those injuries
constantly training and rolling.

2304
01:00:48,621 --> 01:00:49,880
Never really letting it heal.

2305
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:51,980
K or cane hitched surgery.

2306
01:00:52,010 --> 01:00:52,650
Yes.

2307
01:00:52,650 --> 01:00:54,110
On more than one occasion.

2308
01:00:54,140 --> 01:00:54,973
Yeah,

2309
01:00:55,070 --> 01:00:55,700
on his desk.

2310
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:56,420
He didn't do the,

2311
01:00:56,420 --> 01:00:57,730
and he's still not back.

2312
01:00:58,010 --> 01:00:58,730
I mean canes,

2313
01:00:58,730 --> 01:01:01,680
there's no fight lined up
for cane and Cain steep on.

2314
01:01:01,690 --> 01:01:04,430
Maybe that would be the device
that would be the fight,

2315
01:01:04,431 --> 01:01:07,130
but I mean if your cane mean Jesus Christ,

2316
01:01:07,131 --> 01:01:08,240
he's been out for ever.

2317
01:01:08,390 --> 01:01:08,661
Excuse me.

2318
01:01:08,661 --> 01:01:09,311
A tough fight for him.

2319
01:01:09,311 --> 01:01:09,720
Yeah,

2320
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:10,131
a real,

2321
01:01:10,131 --> 01:01:11,210
just a fight to make though.

2322
01:01:11,590 --> 01:01:11,830
Dude.

2323
01:01:11,830 --> 01:01:12,800
Steep pays just,

2324
01:01:12,830 --> 01:01:14,210
he's a monster right now.

2325
01:01:14,390 --> 01:01:15,590
He's in Bruce Kane is,

2326
01:01:15,650 --> 01:01:16,400
I mean,

2327
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:19,170
especially if it's a like a
healthy cake ready to go to.

2328
01:01:19,171 --> 01:01:20,750
It's the best fight in a long,

2329
01:01:20,751 --> 01:01:21,680
long time at heavyweight.

2330
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:22,550
Oh Man.

2331
01:01:22,550 --> 01:01:23,181
Are you kidding me?

2332
01:01:23,181 --> 01:01:24,310
I was calling lesbian,

2333
01:01:24,311 --> 01:01:24,700
I think.

2334
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:24,951
Yeah,

2335
01:01:24,951 --> 01:01:28,280
I would have loved to seen
that fight in his prime canes,

2336
01:01:28,281 --> 01:01:30,390
prime and steep Steve Bay right now.

2337
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:31,750
Like people would go out.

2338
01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:33,230
It came over the hill,

2339
01:01:33,350 --> 01:01:35,990
came beat the brakes off Travis Browne.

2340
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:36,430
He looked at him.

2341
01:01:36,430 --> 01:01:38,760
Travis is obviously no punk like he'd be,

2342
01:01:38,770 --> 01:01:40,070
he looked fucking great.

2343
01:01:40,130 --> 01:01:40,520
Yeah.

2344
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:40,880
I think,

2345
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:42,230
I just think the guy needs rest.

2346
01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:44,200
I'm really thinking a
little bit more than that.

2347
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:47,330
He's got a cumulative injuries for sure,

2348
01:01:47,331 --> 01:01:49,220
but those were because he's rushing.

2349
01:01:49,221 --> 01:01:50,330
They can't rush in the camp,

2350
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:52,640
so maybe if he takes all this time off,

2351
01:01:52,641 --> 01:01:53,930
they fight at the end of the year.

2352
01:01:54,110 --> 01:01:57,660
We get a prime cane versus a prime
Steve Bay sign me the fuck up.

2353
01:01:57,820 --> 01:01:58,670
Just came that Mary,

2354
01:01:58,880 --> 01:01:59,450
how old is he?

2355
01:01:59,450 --> 01:02:00,470
He's still fairly young.

2356
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:02,930
I think he's 32 he's not that old.

2357
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:03,420
Wow.

2358
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:03,601
Yeah.

2359
01:02:03,601 --> 01:02:04,011
He just,

2360
01:02:04,011 --> 01:02:07,490
he puts his body through the ringer and
his fighting style is a grinding style

2361
01:02:07,491 --> 01:02:10,590
that's going to catch up where you were
showing that video of him doing a kettle

2362
01:02:10,610 --> 01:02:13,790
bells with those really heavy weight that
he was probably training a little bit.

2363
01:02:13,970 --> 01:02:14,600
He,

2364
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:17,660
he fucked up and he had a bad strength
and conditioning coach for sure.

2365
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:19,010
And he's got,

2366
01:02:19,050 --> 01:02:24,050
that guy got criticized hard core by
people that are like really in the know

2367
01:02:24,421 --> 01:02:28,220
about technique and back
rounded or Kettlebell swings.

2368
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:30,300
It was more of like a like a,

2369
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:32,010
it was like almost like a shrug.

2370
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:33,050
If I got 200 pounds,

2371
01:02:33,130 --> 01:02:33,610
I'm crazy.

2372
01:02:33,610 --> 01:02:34,500
And chocolate balls,

2373
01:02:34,501 --> 01:02:34,880
injuries,

2374
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:35,550
tub.

2375
01:02:35,550 --> 01:02:35,731
No,

2376
01:02:35,731 --> 01:02:36,990
that's definitely not helping.

2377
01:02:36,991 --> 01:02:37,161
No,

2378
01:02:37,161 --> 01:02:37,800
it's not helping.

2379
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:38,633
There's a lot of fun.

2380
01:02:38,660 --> 01:02:39,600
As he corrected that.

2381
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:40,473
Does he have a better,

2382
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:41,693
I dunno,

2383
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:41,971
you know,

2384
01:02:41,971 --> 01:02:43,020
you'd have to talk to Kane,

2385
01:02:43,230 --> 01:02:45,120
but all all bullshit aside.

2386
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:45,751
He,

2387
01:02:45,751 --> 01:02:46,620
in my eyes,

2388
01:02:46,650 --> 01:02:49,530
he's one of two of the greatest
heavyweights of all time.

2389
01:02:49,830 --> 01:02:50,571
He got fade or,

2390
01:02:50,571 --> 01:02:51,840
and you got cane for me,

2391
01:02:51,860 --> 01:02:52,693
he's one of two.

2392
01:02:52,710 --> 01:02:53,150
Well,

2393
01:02:53,150 --> 01:02:54,810
but also it's steep.

2394
01:02:54,811 --> 01:02:55,990
A fade or cane.

2395
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:57,470
Steve Bay's resume.

2396
01:02:57,490 --> 01:02:59,730
I mean he's top three of all time.

2397
01:02:59,790 --> 01:03:00,600
Yeah.

2398
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:03,750
Well were doing was right up there
until Steve Bay knocked him out.

2399
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:08,780
No for doom submitted fade or he
submitted Minataro and he submitted cane.

2400
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:14,100
He submitted three of the top five and
looked it looked great against Travis

2401
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:14,130
Browne.

2402
01:03:14,130 --> 01:03:14,350
Yeah.

2403
01:03:14,350 --> 01:03:14,571
I mean,

2404
01:03:14,571 --> 01:03:15,404
you know,

2405
01:03:16,170 --> 01:03:18,610
twice three of the top five
heavyweights of all time.

2406
01:03:18,940 --> 01:03:19,630
Uh,

2407
01:03:19,630 --> 01:03:23,130
p s flight card in July got
over him for doom rematch.

2408
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:25,080
That first one was strike
Strikeforce or that one.

2409
01:03:25,790 --> 01:03:26,840
The third one's trilogies.

2410
01:03:26,850 --> 01:03:27,230
Right.

2411
01:03:27,230 --> 01:03:28,200
That's one strike Strikeforce.

2412
01:03:28,201 --> 01:03:33,201
I watched the other night a soap or a
terrible fight or Jim's sitting there

2413
01:03:34,250 --> 01:03:36,240
fucked his knee up real
early in the fight.

2414
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:37,260
Real early.

2415
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:38,093
Terrible fight though.

2416
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:38,671
Yeah.

2417
01:03:38,671 --> 01:03:40,050
What a what a crazy.

2418
01:03:40,110 --> 01:03:40,801
A rematch.

2419
01:03:40,801 --> 01:03:41,181
So that's kid.

2420
01:03:41,181 --> 01:03:43,200
It'd be a fun one in it and over.

2421
01:03:43,201 --> 01:03:45,630
It has been knocked out so
many times in his career.

2422
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:46,380
Oh Dude.

2423
01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:47,250
I just feel like,

2424
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:48,001
I don't know,

2425
01:03:48,001 --> 01:03:49,950
it just gets to a point
where you're just like,

2426
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:50,640
to what,

2427
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:54,450
when are you going to realize that
you're taking serious punishment?

2428
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:56,190
I think Dutch people are different.

2429
01:03:56,340 --> 01:03:58,140
I think they could just
keep getting knocked out.

2430
01:03:58,290 --> 01:03:59,220
I feel like he's all right.

2431
01:03:59,250 --> 01:03:59,821
He's the one guy.

2432
01:03:59,821 --> 01:04:00,780
That's all right.

2433
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:01,673
I don't know.

2434
01:04:01,860 --> 01:04:04,800
This is the thing be you say that
when you watch him fight for doom,

2435
01:04:04,830 --> 01:04:09,060
you will and you'll be sitting fucking
front row clapping when he knocked out.

2436
01:04:09,060 --> 01:04:10,440
My fans are like this,

2437
01:04:10,441 --> 01:04:11,130
like I can't,

2438
01:04:11,130 --> 01:04:14,200
he keeps getting knocked out when
that motherfucker fight one tunes and

2439
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:15,290
unnecessarily Ashley,

2440
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:16,990
come on be overeating.

2441
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:17,930
Not In anymore.

2442
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:18,760
There's one fight away.

2443
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:19,950
He just fought for a title.

2444
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:21,900
He went on a win street.

2445
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:22,710
I don't care.

2446
01:04:22,710 --> 01:04:23,543
Oh Bullshit.

2447
01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:24,583
I really don't.

2448
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:26,510
I don't find it that exciting.

2449
01:04:26,540 --> 01:04:27,780
If it's a worldclass tracker,

2450
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:30,570
I dub dub dub would
light a lot of guys out,

2451
01:04:30,571 --> 01:04:31,404
but here's the thing,

2452
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:34,830
the best heavyweight striker
of all time over him.

2453
01:04:34,831 --> 01:04:36,360
You won't want to watch him fight,

2454
01:04:36,930 --> 01:04:38,460
but that title,

2455
01:04:39,270 --> 01:04:40,010
right?

2456
01:04:40,010 --> 01:04:40,171
No,

2457
01:04:40,171 --> 01:04:43,500
he just went for a title
and knocked I STP on is,

2458
01:04:43,501 --> 01:04:44,400
as I understand,

2459
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:45,330
he fought for a title.

2460
01:04:45,770 --> 01:04:47,150
He's the best striker in the UFC.

2461
01:04:47,151 --> 01:04:47,761
I understand,

2462
01:04:47,761 --> 01:04:51,030
but if you could pull up how many times
have been knocked out in the past two

2463
01:04:51,031 --> 01:04:51,780
years?

2464
01:04:51,780 --> 01:04:52,830
It's done a bunch.

2465
01:04:52,860 --> 01:04:53,681
It's tough to watch.

2466
01:04:53,681 --> 01:04:54,241
It's two years.

2467
01:04:54,241 --> 01:04:54,810
Not really.

2468
01:04:54,810 --> 01:04:56,010
And there's a lot the past two years,

2469
01:04:56,011 --> 01:04:56,350
Jay,

2470
01:04:56,350 --> 01:04:57,300
like there is,

2471
01:04:57,390 --> 01:04:57,870
it's,

2472
01:04:57,870 --> 01:04:58,231
I don't know,

2473
01:04:58,231 --> 01:04:59,400
you've got to remember 10 excited.

2474
01:04:59,430 --> 01:05:00,050
He fought it.

2475
01:05:00,050 --> 01:05:00,883
The bullshit.

2476
01:05:01,210 --> 01:05:02,350
You're buying time now.

2477
01:05:02,530 --> 01:05:05,340
He fucking fun at the highest
level in the world and striking.

2478
01:05:05,430 --> 01:05:07,950
So he's going to have more
knockouts then of her doom.

2479
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:08,520
Then um,

2480
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:12,330
then all these other guys come to the
territory but not so much anymore.

2481
01:05:12,331 --> 01:05:13,110
Right.

2482
01:05:13,110 --> 01:05:13,900
That's all I'm saying.

2483
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:16,050
I say these two names just don't
want to see him get knocked out.

2484
01:05:16,051 --> 01:05:16,290
A Guy,

2485
01:05:16,290 --> 01:05:17,980
I'll hot sun and I commit off.

2486
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:18,760
That's what I'm saying.

2487
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:22,270
Try doing a spelling bee for those little
bitches on tap for this fight card.

2488
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:23,320
That's a beast.

2489
01:05:23,650 --> 01:05:24,560
I was looking at it early on.

2490
01:05:24,610 --> 01:05:26,060
Well I'm fuck this guys are wrestling,

2491
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:27,990
not a match.

2492
01:05:27,991 --> 01:05:28,960
Truong grappling.

2493
01:05:30,370 --> 01:05:31,610
See there's like there's,

2494
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:35,330
there's regular strength and then
there's Russian dudes strength,

2495
01:05:35,980 --> 01:05:38,320
especially Harry Russian dudes strength.

2496
01:05:38,570 --> 01:05:40,920
They got here 10% strong.

2497
01:05:40,921 --> 01:05:41,754
Good.

2498
01:05:41,890 --> 01:05:42,250
I looked at,

2499
01:05:42,250 --> 01:05:43,790
I looked at our Laski shoulders on it.

2500
01:05:43,830 --> 01:05:44,663
There's hair on the shoulders.

2501
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:45,500
Gotcha.

2502
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:46,430
God Damn it.

2503
01:05:46,431 --> 01:05:47,890
That's like extra testosterone.

2504
01:05:47,891 --> 01:05:48,880
Dhea too on his back.

2505
01:05:48,881 --> 01:05:51,340
Fucked me and I'm smooth as a seal.

2506
01:05:51,341 --> 01:05:52,174
Fuck.

2507
01:05:52,180 --> 01:05:53,590
That's coming out of his ears.

2508
01:05:53,591 --> 01:05:54,910
Like although shaving brush

2509
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:57,990
connected as mustaches.

2510
01:05:58,080 --> 01:05:59,250
Oh God damn it.

2511
01:06:00,330 --> 01:06:02,920
And then look at that
beard for God's sakes.

2512
01:06:03,220 --> 01:06:03,640
He's,

2513
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:04,473
he's

2514
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:06,333
straight up.

2515
01:06:06,340 --> 01:06:06,730
He's,

2516
01:06:06,730 --> 01:06:09,490
he's one of those wind up
before you throw a punch.

2517
01:06:09,491 --> 01:06:10,121
Guy's like,

2518
01:06:10,121 --> 01:06:11,230
he's like digging in.

2519
01:06:11,231 --> 01:06:12,390
Some would say stiff.

2520
01:06:13,490 --> 01:06:13,790
Yeah,

2521
01:06:13,790 --> 01:06:14,623
real stiff.

2522
01:06:15,130 --> 01:06:16,690
It's not just a stiffness.

2523
01:06:16,730 --> 01:06:18,070
I mean like a lot of these guys,

2524
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:20,440
they could be like more fluid,

2525
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:22,750
but they're trying to knock
you out with every shot.

2526
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:25,090
It's almost like a curse to power.

2527
01:06:25,810 --> 01:06:27,880
Like it's absolutely beneficial.

2528
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:30,250
There's also a curse to it.

2529
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:30,770
Well,

2530
01:06:30,770 --> 01:06:33,370
you can come down so much.

2531
01:06:34,210 --> 01:06:37,030
It slows you down so much when
you're trying to use it that much.

2532
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:40,540
But the greatness comes to
the guys know when to use it.

2533
01:06:40,541 --> 01:06:41,410
Right timing.

2534
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:42,273
Yeah.

2535
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:42,611
Well,

2536
01:06:42,611 --> 01:06:47,611
one of the most beautiful things that you
see in Connor style is how he has none

2537
01:06:48,251 --> 01:06:49,084
of that.

2538
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:50,770
Like when he's throwing punches,

2539
01:06:51,130 --> 01:06:53,280
unless he's got you fucked up and stunned,

2540
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:54,050
then you're fucked.

2541
01:06:54,050 --> 01:06:57,370
Diego Brandao speaking a punches gate G.

2542
01:06:57,370 --> 01:06:57,941
Have you seen gates?

2543
01:06:57,941 --> 01:06:59,750
He doesn't get you fight Justin Gauges.

2544
01:06:59,751 --> 01:07:00,551
He's a bad motherfucker.

2545
01:07:00,551 --> 01:07:01,690
He's gonna Fight Michael Johnson.

2546
01:07:01,691 --> 01:07:03,380
How good of a hearse fight that?

2547
01:07:03,610 --> 01:07:04,443
When is that?

2548
01:07:04,540 --> 01:07:04,920
Uh,

2549
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:05,930
June.

2550
01:07:06,100 --> 01:07:07,030
Is it June or July?

2551
01:07:07,031 --> 01:07:07,571
It was July.

2552
01:07:07,571 --> 01:07:08,740
So it's on the job.

2553
01:07:10,850 --> 01:07:12,280
It's the ultimate fighter finale.

2554
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:13,410
Oh.

2555
01:07:13,570 --> 01:07:13,901
Either way.

2556
01:07:13,901 --> 01:07:15,720
It's in that weird span of fights.

2557
01:07:16,180 --> 01:07:16,831
Justin Gates,

2558
01:07:16,831 --> 01:07:18,550
she just says technique.

2559
01:07:18,551 --> 01:07:19,384
Fuck it.

2560
01:07:19,510 --> 01:07:21,100
We got two of the big guys from there.

2561
01:07:21,101 --> 01:07:22,590
We've got Marlin Mariah's too.

2562
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:24,910
Was also a fucking base three.

2563
01:07:25,130 --> 01:07:27,610
He got a gate g you got homeboy.

2564
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:28,930
Who Was the light heavyweight champ?

2565
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:29,920
Middleweight champ.

2566
01:07:30,070 --> 01:07:30,701
David Branch.

2567
01:07:30,701 --> 01:07:31,361
David Branch.

2568
01:07:31,361 --> 01:07:31,481
Yeah,

2569
01:07:31,481 --> 01:07:32,111
he came over.

2570
01:07:32,111 --> 01:07:33,520
He just one awful fight.

2571
01:07:33,521 --> 01:07:35,320
But that's all that it
takes a lot of warm up.

2572
01:07:35,321 --> 01:07:38,080
Where the fuck did he fight a
number nine light heavyweight.

2573
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:39,610
The Russian cat.

2574
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:41,110
Is He Russian creation?

2575
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:41,400
You don't,

2576
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:43,720
I'm talking about flying under the radar,

2577
01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:44,620
but either way.

2578
01:07:44,620 --> 01:07:45,700
Awful fucking fight.

2579
01:07:45,910 --> 01:07:46,361
Oh yeah.

2580
01:07:46,361 --> 01:07:46,571
Yeah.

2581
01:07:46,571 --> 01:07:47,404
I remember Morales.

2582
01:07:47,950 --> 01:07:48,131
Hey,

2583
01:07:48,131 --> 01:07:49,470
do you guys think that the economy,

2584
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:50,313
Mcgregor,

2585
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:51,011
Floyd Mayweather,

2586
01:07:51,011 --> 01:07:51,581
the thing is,

2587
01:07:51,581 --> 01:07:56,581
is all a hoax and just a way to get
Connor to have people talking about him

2588
01:07:56,591 --> 01:07:57,640
until he has his next fight.

2589
01:07:58,060 --> 01:07:59,290
Like do you think that's just a big,

2590
01:07:59,291 --> 01:08:00,450
huge thing to say?

2591
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:02,320
It's marketing ploy.

2592
01:08:02,710 --> 01:08:03,940
I think the world's flat too.

2593
01:08:05,140 --> 01:08:05,973
You think it's real?

2594
01:08:06,370 --> 01:08:08,140
I think me and Joe Bolte
don't want to talk about,

2595
01:08:08,141 --> 01:08:10,210
I think we're both at red
in the face time that no,

2596
01:08:10,211 --> 01:08:10,800
I think,

2597
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:10,930
no.

2598
01:08:10,930 --> 01:08:11,170
I mean,

2599
01:08:11,170 --> 01:08:12,280
do you think he's like an album box?

2600
01:08:12,281 --> 01:08:13,060
It's going to happen.

2601
01:08:13,060 --> 01:08:15,950
It's going to be what's it's gonna happen.

2602
01:08:15,951 --> 01:08:16,491
It's gonna happen.

2603
01:08:16,491 --> 01:08:17,570
It's so close.

2604
01:08:17,650 --> 01:08:17,810
No,

2605
01:08:17,810 --> 01:08:19,770
I'm telling you this.

2606
01:08:19,890 --> 01:08:20,723
Why I don't talk to him.

2607
01:08:23,590 --> 01:08:24,423
You got one.

2608
01:08:26,150 --> 01:08:29,540
There is a current birthing contract to
a new podcast called the fighter and the

2609
01:08:29,541 --> 01:08:30,374
man,

2610
01:08:32,750 --> 01:08:33,540
listen to me.

2611
01:08:33,540 --> 01:08:38,390
She's too confusing tracked who was
in the UFC and Connor Verde come to an

2612
01:08:38,391 --> 01:08:43,130
agreement and we can update them because
right now they're in negotiation with

2613
01:08:43,131 --> 01:08:44,600
the Floyd Mayweather team.

2614
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:47,810
So Floyd me where the team is going
to want an exorbitant amount of money.

2615
01:08:47,811 --> 01:08:48,680
They're very patient.

2616
01:08:48,681 --> 01:08:50,390
They going to take a long
time to drive us out.

2617
01:08:50,391 --> 01:08:50,660
Right.

2618
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:52,010
So they can get the best deal.

2619
01:08:52,190 --> 01:08:56,180
But essentially the UFC and Connor
have come to some sort of promotional

2620
01:08:56,181 --> 01:09:00,230
agreement and now they have to figure
out how much money Floyd gets and whether

2621
01:09:00,231 --> 01:09:05,120
or not they want to gamble on giving him
a flat rate of like a hundred million

2622
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:05,121
dollars.

2623
01:09:05,121 --> 01:09:05,990
Whatever the fuck he wants.

2624
01:09:05,991 --> 01:09:08,390
That's a big whether that's a big like if,

2625
01:09:08,450 --> 01:09:08,751
yeah,

2626
01:09:08,751 --> 01:09:10,670
but he's also going to
want a piece of the pie.

2627
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:11,150
Correct.

2628
01:09:11,150 --> 01:09:12,980
They'll be not close to a contract yet.

2629
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:14,300
They're not close,

2630
01:09:14,301 --> 01:09:17,630
but they're 90% that's what
I'm saying is that I feel like,

2631
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:18,000
oh,

2632
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:18,830
so what happens?

2633
01:09:18,830 --> 01:09:21,560
They don't pretend that you
have any knowledge of this.

2634
01:09:22,130 --> 01:09:23,300
Just do everybody a favor.

2635
01:09:24,230 --> 01:09:24,951
I'm yourself.

2636
01:09:24,951 --> 01:09:25,970
That's my theory.

2637
01:09:26,030 --> 01:09:30,560
Do yourself a favor and don't let your
mouth get ahead of life theory that I

2638
01:09:30,561 --> 01:09:34,130
believe this is a very smart way of
keeping him in align lightheaded.

2639
01:09:34,180 --> 01:09:34,971
That's by the way,

2640
01:09:34,971 --> 01:09:35,804
let me ask you this.

2641
01:09:36,050 --> 01:09:36,560
When,

2642
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:37,011
when,

2643
01:09:37,011 --> 01:09:37,844
um,

2644
01:09:38,150 --> 01:09:39,050
Tony Ferguson,

2645
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:44,320
and let's just say tiny furniture sending
could be fight before that and now,

2646
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:47,990
now somebody is waiting to fight.

2647
01:09:47,991 --> 01:09:48,590
Conor,

2648
01:09:48,590 --> 01:09:51,860
will Conor fight those guys
before he fights Floyd?

2649
01:09:51,890 --> 01:09:52,550
No,

2650
01:09:52,550 --> 01:09:53,151
definitely not.

2651
01:09:53,151 --> 01:09:54,430
So then what happens to the money?

2652
01:09:54,510 --> 01:09:58,300
The money right now is in
Floyd versus Connor for Connor.

2653
01:09:58,330 --> 01:10:00,710
And it's just exorbitant money.

2654
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:01,760
Like he might make,

2655
01:10:01,761 --> 01:10:03,950
who knows how many fucking
millions of dollars,

2656
01:10:03,951 --> 01:10:04,970
maybe a hundred.

2657
01:10:05,180 --> 01:10:05,690
Right?

2658
01:10:05,690 --> 01:10:07,760
So that's where the
real money is for Floyd.

2659
01:10:07,790 --> 01:10:08,041
Right?

2660
01:10:08,041 --> 01:10:09,770
And this is where the
real money is for Connor.

2661
01:10:09,980 --> 01:10:14,980
So for Connor to jeopardize
that by fighting that fucking
Russian savage or Tony

2662
01:10:15,290 --> 01:10:16,520
Ferguson who also could beat him,

2663
01:10:16,910 --> 01:10:17,211
I mean,

2664
01:10:17,211 --> 01:10:18,620
I'm not saying he's going to,

2665
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:23,800
but it the off Tony Ferguson
is a motherfucking world
champion caliber fighter.

2666
01:10:24,350 --> 01:10:25,700
So is Habib.

2667
01:10:26,090 --> 01:10:28,070
That's a fucking killer fight.

2668
01:10:28,430 --> 01:10:29,000
So,

2669
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,910
but we don't even know if Khabib
can even make one 55 anymore,

2670
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:32,753
man.

2671
01:10:33,430 --> 01:10:35,900
He says he can influence by in October.

2672
01:10:35,901 --> 01:10:36,081
Right?

2673
01:10:36,081 --> 01:10:36,620
Of course there was,

2674
01:10:36,620 --> 01:10:37,460
he says he can,

2675
01:10:37,461 --> 01:10:38,390
but he didn't make it.

2676
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:41,510
Not only did he not make it this fucking
liver shutting down and he had to go to

2677
01:10:41,511 --> 01:10:42,380
the Goddamn hospital.

2678
01:10:42,470 --> 01:10:43,071
Did you die?

2679
01:10:43,071 --> 01:10:43,670
Can we was like,

2680
01:10:43,670 --> 01:10:43,821
oh,

2681
01:10:43,821 --> 01:10:44,690
but did you die?

2682
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:45,270
Almost,

2683
01:10:45,270 --> 01:10:46,220
but did you die?

2684
01:10:46,221 --> 01:10:47,180
Did you tie it?

2685
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:48,110
Hey,

2686
01:10:48,110 --> 01:10:51,020
get up and make 55 so I
can fucking eat my popcorn.

2687
01:10:51,020 --> 01:10:52,250
And you fight Tony Ferguson.

2688
01:10:52,970 --> 01:10:53,803
Did you die?

2689
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:56,990
Did not get the fuck up there and
make the weight for my entertainment.

2690
01:10:57,710 --> 01:10:58,690
I just need one fight.

2691
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:00,260
But did you die?

2692
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:02,113
Could be,

2693
01:11:03,590 --> 01:11:05,000
whose is that Ken?

2694
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:05,670
That's what I'm,

2695
01:11:05,670 --> 01:11:06,350
yeah,

2696
01:11:06,350 --> 01:11:07,010
Ken.

2697
01:11:07,010 --> 01:11:07,843
Ken Jones.

2698
01:11:08,490 --> 01:11:10,100
What did you type love that guy.

2699
01:11:10,101 --> 01:11:11,360
He's so fucking funny.

2700
01:11:12,170 --> 01:11:13,650
I'm such nice guy.

2701
01:11:13,740 --> 01:11:14,700
He's the best.

2702
01:11:14,701 --> 01:11:15,490
Does he do stand up?

2703
01:11:15,490 --> 01:11:15,900
Yeah,

2704
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:16,470
those little stairs.

2705
01:11:16,470 --> 01:11:17,940
A lot of is that doctor right?

2706
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,900
The doctor told me he could practice.

2707
01:11:22,110 --> 01:11:23,400
He legitimately could practice.

2708
01:11:23,401 --> 01:11:24,360
That'd be pissed with shut up.

2709
01:11:24,390 --> 01:11:25,201
And that was my doctor.

2710
01:11:25,201 --> 01:11:25,351
I'm like,

2711
01:11:25,351 --> 01:11:27,030
don't you ever fucking audition to go to,

2712
01:11:27,031 --> 01:11:27,721
but fuck this.

2713
01:11:27,721 --> 01:11:29,610
I'm not doing anything
over one and two in here,

2714
01:11:29,611 --> 01:11:30,444
man.

2715
01:11:30,450 --> 01:11:31,680
I want a full time guy.

2716
01:11:32,130 --> 01:11:34,530
Real Dick car.

2717
01:11:34,531 --> 01:11:36,390
That thing was totaled the time.

2718
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:37,200
You can't be real.

2719
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:37,291
Oh,

2720
01:11:37,291 --> 01:11:37,960
that's real.

2721
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:39,390
It's now come on.

2722
01:11:39,391 --> 01:11:40,224
Cause his real dick.

2723
01:11:40,230 --> 01:11:41,010
Yeah.

2724
01:11:41,010 --> 01:11:41,820
Hey man,

2725
01:11:41,820 --> 01:11:43,680
you think it was like it was he Korean?

2726
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:46,020
What is these Chinese,

2727
01:11:46,021 --> 01:11:46,451
I believe,

2728
01:11:46,451 --> 01:11:50,970
do you think there's a Korean or Chinese
dude with just a fucking egg roll for a

2729
01:11:50,980 --> 01:11:51,380
cock?

2730
01:11:51,380 --> 01:11:53,100
Just got a big old dumpling.

2731
01:11:53,250 --> 01:11:53,940
First of all.

2732
01:11:53,940 --> 01:11:57,360
Now there's gotta be some fucking
genetic engineering to doing over there.

2733
01:11:57,390 --> 01:11:58,950
They're doing that CRISPR thing.

2734
01:11:59,190 --> 01:12:00,110
You know that genetic,

2735
01:12:00,130 --> 01:12:00,963
uh,

2736
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:04,530
taking embryos and changing their genes,

2737
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:06,720
they're definitely worth
on that big dick gene.

2738
01:12:06,750 --> 01:12:09,810
They say there are seven years away from
the trials where you can have different

2739
01:12:09,811 --> 01:12:10,260
hair.

2740
01:12:10,260 --> 01:12:10,950
I can't wait.

2741
01:12:10,950 --> 01:12:13,380
What if you have like big Dick Gene?

2742
01:12:13,381 --> 01:12:15,330
But it only comes with clown feet.

2743
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:16,370
Oh,

2744
01:12:16,370 --> 01:12:19,800
the only way you could get big tick
is you gotta have fun pictures.

2745
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:22,473
No,

2746
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:22,980
no,

2747
01:12:22,980 --> 01:12:23,080
no,

2748
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:23,221
no.

2749
01:12:23,221 --> 01:12:25,650
I'm not like fucking double
like double her feet.

2750
01:12:26,010 --> 01:12:26,843
No feet.

2751
01:12:28,110 --> 01:12:29,550
You're doing no sports.

2752
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:30,690
I'd rather have that baby.

2753
01:12:30,690 --> 01:12:32,190
Don't swim like a motherfucker.

2754
01:12:32,220 --> 01:12:32,301
Oh,

2755
01:12:32,301 --> 01:12:33,134
that's true.

2756
01:12:34,070 --> 01:12:37,410
You can have your cutting and Maren
mountain climbing would be off the charts.

2757
01:12:37,870 --> 01:12:38,621
That dorsal fin,

2758
01:12:38,621 --> 01:12:39,421
the Fra Cock.

2759
01:12:39,421 --> 01:12:40,860
That's not going to help
you through the water.

2760
01:12:40,890 --> 01:12:41,710
That's true.

2761
01:12:41,710 --> 01:12:44,760
Think that fucker ride
your like flotation device.

2762
01:12:45,790 --> 01:12:48,780
Have you were on some Viagara
could actually be a float device.

2763
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:51,600
Agnes bodies.

2764
01:12:52,140 --> 01:12:53,190
You can make your Dick Bigger.

2765
01:12:53,220 --> 01:12:55,250
There's an operation that no,

2766
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:57,050
only by an inch be right.

2767
01:12:57,051 --> 01:12:59,250
Can you cut that cord or something?

2768
01:12:59,251 --> 01:13:00,170
You cut the tenant,

2769
01:13:00,171 --> 01:13:00,871
but there's also,

2770
01:13:00,871 --> 01:13:02,460
I think you can make it thicker too.

2771
01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:03,600
There's a whole process.

2772
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:05,100
They pump it up with fat,

2773
01:13:05,101 --> 01:13:09,690
but what's going to happen is you're
going to have a floppy fat that sounds all

2774
01:13:09,691 --> 01:13:11,820
four or this fat deposits the wrong way.

2775
01:13:11,821 --> 01:13:13,890
So you've got a big old
door knob for a happy,

2776
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:17,230
it all seeps down to the bottom and take.

2777
01:13:17,250 --> 01:13:22,250
Looks like it's got to have fucking belly
man's penis and transplant operation.

2778
01:13:22,781 --> 01:13:23,580
It's a lie.

2779
01:13:23,580 --> 01:13:23,820
No,

2780
01:13:23,820 --> 01:13:23,941
no,

2781
01:13:23,941 --> 01:13:24,500
it's not allowed.

2782
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:28,200
They have done penis transplants
now because there's three of them.

2783
01:13:28,740 --> 01:13:31,320
I thought that last one in a circumcision

2784
01:13:33,450 --> 01:13:37,560
circumcision apparently that the real
issue with these transplants is Africa

2785
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:40,620
because African traditional
circumcisions or ruthless.

2786
01:13:40,621 --> 01:13:41,190
You wanna see one,

2787
01:13:41,190 --> 01:13:41,941
I got one of my phone.

2788
01:13:41,941 --> 01:13:43,080
You can get her actions already.

2789
01:13:43,810 --> 01:13:45,570
Know what they do it with.

2790
01:13:45,890 --> 01:13:47,100
Leak their teeth or some shit.

2791
01:13:47,430 --> 01:13:50,780
Do it in a bad west as Oregon after
I was off traditional circumcision,

2792
01:13:50,790 --> 01:13:51,890
don't fuck that up.

2793
01:13:51,910 --> 01:13:52,743
Bought

2794
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,650
steady hand traditional.

2795
01:13:55,740 --> 01:13:56,860
He's like 23 years ago.

2796
01:13:57,460 --> 01:13:57,720
Yeah.

2797
01:13:57,720 --> 01:14:01,320
Traditional debt and the only
dictate could get was white

2798
01:14:02,930 --> 01:14:04,010
first one that comes available.

2799
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:04,921
I'll take you.

2800
01:14:04,921 --> 01:14:06,960
Would you would take no
dick over a white Dick.

2801
01:14:06,961 --> 01:14:07,360
Here we go.

2802
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:07,440
Well,

2803
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:09,200
I played a few weeks for a black dude.

2804
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:09,901
That's how they do it.

2805
01:14:09,901 --> 01:14:10,734
Press that button.

2806
01:14:11,770 --> 01:14:13,000
I don't say I didn't warn you.

2807
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:16,953
What are we looking at?

2808
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:18,470
Traditional circumcision.

2809
01:14:18,471 --> 01:14:19,150
It's on his phone.

2810
01:14:19,150 --> 01:14:20,140
Oh Jesus Christ.

2811
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:22,370
I told you my Sunday.

2812
01:14:23,750 --> 01:14:25,480
Do you want to look at it?

2813
01:14:25,830 --> 01:14:26,663
Do it be,

2814
01:14:27,370 --> 01:14:28,270
should I not look at it?

2815
01:14:28,390 --> 01:14:30,140
I have a family barbecue to go up.

2816
01:14:30,690 --> 01:14:31,523
Not Dogs.

2817
01:14:31,780 --> 01:14:32,613
Press play.

2818
01:14:33,980 --> 01:14:36,730
Why do I have a traditional
African circumcision?

2819
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:37,451
I make my phone.

2820
01:14:37,451 --> 01:14:38,284
Do you have that?

2821
01:14:41,140 --> 01:14:42,260
You want to see Koreans?

2822
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:42,840
I created.

2823
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:43,960
So we look for Brazilian.

2824
01:14:45,190 --> 01:14:45,741
Did I ever tell you,

2825
01:14:45,741 --> 01:14:45,880
hey,

2826
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:46,550
go watch this.

2827
01:14:46,550 --> 01:14:46,960
All right,

2828
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:47,793
hold on.

2829
01:14:48,270 --> 01:14:49,103
Hold on.

2830
01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:50,443
Okay.

2831
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:53,430
Oh God dammit.

2832
01:14:53,850 --> 01:14:54,870
Fuck you man.

2833
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:55,411
Fuck you.

2834
01:14:55,411 --> 01:14:56,244
Take that away.

2835
01:14:56,370 --> 01:14:57,203
Oh No,

2836
01:14:57,850 --> 01:14:59,420
fuck off the stand there.

2837
01:14:59,421 --> 01:15:00,500
They have to stand there.

2838
01:15:00,501 --> 01:15:01,510
Motionless,

2839
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:02,713
motionless.

2840
01:15:03,330 --> 01:15:07,190
That's part of the problem is you
fucked me over cause they cut it.

2841
01:15:07,490 --> 01:15:09,380
They have to stand there and,

2842
01:15:09,410 --> 01:15:10,970
and not react to the pain.

2843
01:15:11,460 --> 01:15:13,280
Worse with Joe Joe when
he first had internet,

2844
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:14,153
he goes,

2845
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:15,361
I'm like,

2846
01:15:15,361 --> 01:15:15,781
what are you doing?

2847
01:15:15,781 --> 01:15:16,920
He had his big computer room.

2848
01:15:17,250 --> 01:15:17,660
He goes,

2849
01:15:17,660 --> 01:15:17,901
all right,

2850
01:15:17,901 --> 01:15:18,551
doll that will stay there.

2851
01:15:18,551 --> 01:15:19,140
Stay there.

2852
01:15:19,140 --> 01:15:19,381
I go,

2853
01:15:19,381 --> 01:15:20,121
well what are you doing to me?

2854
01:15:20,121 --> 01:15:20,430
He goes,

2855
01:15:20,430 --> 01:15:21,660
just stay when I tell you to go,

2856
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:22,200
go.

2857
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:24,390
And he hits play and he runs
out of the room and he goes,

2858
01:15:24,391 --> 01:15:25,170
now watch.

2859
01:15:25,170 --> 01:15:26,190
And I watch and I see this,

2860
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:30,000
I see this beautiful house
and this is a Japanese guy.

2861
01:15:30,060 --> 01:15:32,760
He's dressed like a Samurai
and he's looking at her ass.

2862
01:15:32,770 --> 01:15:33,120
He's going,

2863
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:33,953
oh,

2864
01:15:34,180 --> 01:15:35,013
ah yeah.

2865
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:35,431
And I'm like,

2866
01:15:35,431 --> 01:15:36,151
what's going to go on?

2867
01:15:36,151 --> 01:15:36,984
And I hear him going,

2868
01:15:38,850 --> 01:15:43,680
all of a sudden you just see this big
around pool snake out of this girl's ass.

2869
01:15:43,681 --> 01:15:46,350
And the guy starts to
eat it and he's going,

2870
01:15:46,351 --> 01:15:47,100
he's going to stop.

2871
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:47,933
He's going,

2872
01:15:47,970 --> 01:15:48,803
ah,

2873
01:15:49,650 --> 01:15:51,480
he's throwing up but
laughing at the same time.

2874
01:15:52,050 --> 01:15:52,441
I was like,

2875
01:15:52,441 --> 01:15:52,981
you sick.

2876
01:15:52,981 --> 01:15:53,281
Fuck.

2877
01:15:53,281 --> 01:15:55,740
I've ruined forever and I couldn't
take my eyes off it profit.

2878
01:15:55,880 --> 01:15:57,110
I'll throw up at that stuff.

2879
01:15:57,170 --> 01:15:58,003
I can't see that shit.

2880
01:15:58,100 --> 01:15:58,281
Dude.

2881
01:15:58,281 --> 01:15:58,611
I have,

2882
01:15:58,611 --> 01:16:00,420
I'm John Doe.

2883
01:16:01,570 --> 01:16:02,403
Hey,

2884
01:16:02,450 --> 01:16:03,710
I have John Joseph spoke for you.

2885
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:04,940
Don't let me forget he's signed it.

2886
01:16:05,070 --> 01:16:05,481
Okay,

2887
01:16:05,481 --> 01:16:06,050
cool.

2888
01:16:06,050 --> 01:16:06,740
I turned my car.

2889
01:16:06,740 --> 01:16:07,220
Um,

2890
01:16:07,220 --> 01:16:07,911
I also have,

2891
01:16:07,911 --> 01:16:08,150
uh,

2892
01:16:08,150 --> 01:16:08,630
his,

2893
01:16:08,630 --> 01:16:11,770
his former partners book
here who also really get,

2894
01:16:11,771 --> 01:16:11,990
yeah,

2895
01:16:11,990 --> 01:16:13,460
hardly wants to get on the podcast,

2896
01:16:13,461 --> 01:16:14,241
but they hate each other.

2897
01:16:14,241 --> 01:16:14,580
Right.

2898
01:16:14,580 --> 01:16:15,830
They stab each other or something.

2899
01:16:15,860 --> 01:16:17,380
There's some issues with those guys.

2900
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:18,220
Day Stab Dee.

2901
01:16:18,220 --> 01:16:20,540
Charlie's Harley's that
I had so black belt now,

2902
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:21,250
isn't it?

2903
01:16:21,250 --> 01:16:21,500
Yeah.

2904
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:21,591
Oh,

2905
01:16:21,591 --> 01:16:22,011
that's right.

2906
01:16:22,011 --> 01:16:23,060
He teaches kids class.

2907
01:16:23,110 --> 01:16:23,360
Yeah.

2908
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:23,960
Sad morning.

2909
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:26,300
I started listening to
your boy Jockos book.

2910
01:16:26,510 --> 01:16:26,601
Oh,

2911
01:16:26,601 --> 01:16:27,080
it's amazing.

2912
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:27,201
Yeah.

2913
01:16:27,201 --> 01:16:28,410
He's a beast on chocolates.

2914
01:16:28,820 --> 01:16:29,481
On Instagram.

2915
01:16:29,481 --> 01:16:34,250
There's a video's Christ we played the
other day on the Everlast podcast with

2916
01:16:34,251 --> 01:16:36,680
Jocko luck explaining how
no matter what happens,

2917
01:16:36,681 --> 01:16:37,514
good.

2918
01:16:37,550 --> 01:16:39,140
Good opportunity to get better.

2919
01:16:39,170 --> 01:16:40,700
Good opportunity to grow.

2920
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:43,130
Good time to time to work on things.

2921
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:43,520
Good.

2922
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:43,651
Yeah.

2923
01:16:43,651 --> 01:16:45,320
Well frees up more time for other things.

2924
01:16:45,321 --> 01:16:45,740
Good.

2925
01:16:45,740 --> 01:16:45,951
Oh,

2926
01:16:45,951 --> 01:16:46,820
take everything.

2927
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:50,330
Everything good in his videos
are in black and white.

2928
01:16:50,390 --> 01:16:51,223
Yeah,

2929
01:16:51,260 --> 01:16:51,561
he goes,

2930
01:16:51,561 --> 01:16:52,460
my inner voice.

2931
01:16:52,610 --> 01:16:53,600
Do you want him to keep doing it?

2932
01:16:53,870 --> 01:16:54,240
So you know,

2933
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:57,510
I said nothing cause I don't
listen to the interval.

2934
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:00,620
I was fired up.

2935
01:17:00,650 --> 01:17:00,960
Oh No.

2936
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:01,300
Yeah,

2937
01:17:01,300 --> 01:17:02,133
just,

2938
01:17:02,370 --> 01:17:03,680
she's such a savage.

2939
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:06,200
I say I'm busy come back later.

2940
01:17:06,230 --> 01:17:07,460
But he's a real savage.

2941
01:17:07,461 --> 01:17:08,294
Like he's not like,

2942
01:17:08,390 --> 01:17:08,840
look,

2943
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:10,340
I'll respect to Gary v,

2944
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:11,181
you know,

2945
01:17:11,181 --> 01:17:12,620
like all his motivational videos.

2946
01:17:12,621 --> 01:17:14,180
They don't really do
it for me the same way.

2947
01:17:14,450 --> 01:17:14,991
You know what I'm saying?

2948
01:17:14,991 --> 01:17:16,540
I really love Gary Johnson.

2949
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:17,810
No Jujitsu,

2950
01:17:17,870 --> 01:17:20,200
navy seal commander,

2951
01:17:20,690 --> 01:17:21,290
just matter.

2952
01:17:21,290 --> 01:17:24,240
Just still a navy seal
and I can't list any,

2953
01:17:24,380 --> 01:17:25,490
any motivating people.

2954
01:17:25,491 --> 01:17:28,310
If they're not a navy seal
or they do some extreme shit.

2955
01:17:28,311 --> 01:17:28,810
Yeah,

2956
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:29,620
John is fine.

2957
01:17:29,620 --> 01:17:32,180
We'll listen to Jockos
a state walks the walk.

2958
01:17:32,240 --> 01:17:35,330
Also his name also
fucking super smart guy.

2959
01:17:35,410 --> 01:17:36,650
Like he's not,

2960
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:38,420
I mean he is definitely a meat head,

2961
01:17:38,690 --> 01:17:40,140
but he's the right kind of meat.

2962
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:41,240
Smart meathead.

2963
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:41,871
I mean,

2964
01:17:41,871 --> 01:17:42,500
you're a meathead.

2965
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:44,030
I'm a meathead Brian.

2966
01:17:44,031 --> 01:17:45,920
You're kind of asking me what I am head.

2967
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:46,821
I'm not amazing.

2968
01:17:46,821 --> 01:17:46,971
You are.

2969
01:17:46,971 --> 01:17:48,320
Pretend you're a little bit,

2970
01:17:48,321 --> 01:17:49,790
sometimes you go meet head,

2971
01:17:49,791 --> 01:17:51,260
like when you and him wrestle together,

2972
01:17:51,490 --> 01:17:52,890
then when you get smushed you decided,

2973
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,710
I mean head brain from eight heading,

2974
01:17:54,711 --> 01:17:56,300
you drive an electric car.

2975
01:17:56,360 --> 01:17:57,660
I don't have the frame but I,

2976
01:17:57,661 --> 01:17:58,311
I have a,

2977
01:17:58,311 --> 01:17:59,570
I have a lot of enthusiasm.

2978
01:17:59,571 --> 01:18:02,870
He meatheads with celebrate that they
got a scratch on their forehead from the

2979
01:18:02,871 --> 01:18:06,530
rough frame is not that bad.

2980
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:06,830
Yeah.

2981
01:18:06,830 --> 01:18:07,670
Good Body B.

2982
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:08,690
It's not that bad.

2983
01:18:08,690 --> 01:18:10,880
Like if you really got
into lifting weights,

2984
01:18:10,881 --> 01:18:11,620
you could be Jack.

2985
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:13,350
I've been doing Olympic lifting like lawn.

2986
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:14,910
Really?

2987
01:18:14,910 --> 01:18:15,290
Yup.

2988
01:18:15,290 --> 01:18:15,950
At the offense.

2989
01:18:15,950 --> 01:18:16,521
Barbell club.

2990
01:18:16,521 --> 01:18:16,941
So fuck,

2991
01:18:16,941 --> 01:18:17,541
you got to have to,

2992
01:18:17,541 --> 01:18:18,770
I'd have to confirm it.

2993
01:18:18,810 --> 01:18:20,360
You want to show you something
that makes you feel bad.

2994
01:18:20,420 --> 01:18:21,560
I explode off the line.

2995
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:23,690
Get you some of that B and Soak that in.

2996
01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:24,583
Soak descent.

2997
01:18:24,650 --> 01:18:25,483
See you could get that.

2998
01:18:25,490 --> 01:18:26,990
I'm sorry it happened
to your arm right now.

2999
01:18:27,020 --> 01:18:27,561
Hey Joe.

3000
01:18:27,561 --> 01:18:28,180
You know Brian,

3001
01:18:28,180 --> 01:18:29,120
I had a tattoo.

3002
01:18:29,150 --> 01:18:29,331
You know,

3003
01:18:29,331 --> 01:18:30,500
he has to get a tattoo.

3004
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:31,350
We got,

3005
01:18:31,350 --> 01:18:32,720
remember we got 10 million downloads.

3006
01:18:32,870 --> 01:18:33,380
Yes.

3007
01:18:33,380 --> 01:18:33,591
Oh,

3008
01:18:33,591 --> 01:18:34,424
that's right.

3009
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:35,540
Fighter and the kid tattoo.

3010
01:18:35,810 --> 01:18:36,170
Yeah,

3011
01:18:36,170 --> 01:18:39,830
that's going to be a good thing to
have once fighter in the man goes,

3012
01:18:44,310 --> 01:18:46,670
this is back in the day when
everything was cooking for me.

3013
01:18:50,050 --> 01:18:51,190
I'll just fucking that.

3014
01:18:51,260 --> 01:18:53,210
I'll just lift and then
I'll get a little thicker.

3015
01:18:53,270 --> 01:18:55,940
I just can't put on weight because I
don't try hard enough and I don't care.

3016
01:18:56,960 --> 01:19:00,530
I want to see my box just
with you and Eddie Bravo.

3017
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:01,430
Just you and Eddie.

3018
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:01,870
Bravo.

3019
01:19:01,870 --> 01:19:02,300
God.

3020
01:19:02,300 --> 01:19:03,870
Just the pizzagate chronicles.

3021
01:19:04,130 --> 01:19:04,963
Everyone.

3022
01:19:05,350 --> 01:19:05,960
Oh,

3023
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:07,250
what a beautiful sweep.

3024
01:19:07,340 --> 01:19:08,240
Did I tell you the Donaldson?

3025
01:19:08,241 --> 01:19:10,160
Ronda came and watched me spar and I go,

3026
01:19:10,161 --> 01:19:10,881
what am I doing wrong?

3027
01:19:10,881 --> 01:19:11,230
And he goes,

3028
01:19:11,230 --> 01:19:12,063
everything

3029
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:14,210
here's,

3030
01:19:14,210 --> 01:19:15,260
everybody gave me a lesson.

3031
01:19:15,261 --> 01:19:15,680
It was growing,

3032
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:16,730
but we're flying up the homie.

3033
01:19:16,731 --> 01:19:17,990
So starting me off boxing,

3034
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:18,650
I,

3035
01:19:18,650 --> 01:19:19,490
he wouldn't talk to me.

3036
01:19:19,491 --> 01:19:19,881
He got mad.

3037
01:19:19,881 --> 01:19:21,140
I go my sparring and he goes,

3038
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:24,020
I'm not talking to you about spark.

3039
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:25,820
I can't have this conversation.

3040
01:19:26,120 --> 01:19:26,481
He got it.

3041
01:19:26,481 --> 01:19:27,530
He got really on the plant.

3042
01:19:27,531 --> 01:19:27,970
He goes,

3043
01:19:27,970 --> 01:19:28,161
oh,

3044
01:19:28,161 --> 01:19:29,210
I can't do this.

3045
01:19:29,390 --> 01:19:31,160
I can't cause I was mad and I was like,

3046
01:19:31,161 --> 01:19:32,330
I'm not my left.

3047
01:19:32,330 --> 01:19:32,750
And he's like,

3048
01:19:32,750 --> 01:19:33,470
I'm not going.

3049
01:19:33,470 --> 01:19:34,011
What the fuck?

3050
01:19:34,011 --> 01:19:35,300
Cause I sucked them in for a second.

3051
01:19:35,540 --> 01:19:36,300
Like I sucked him in.

3052
01:19:36,300 --> 01:19:36,531
He's like,

3053
01:19:36,531 --> 01:19:36,651
well,

3054
01:19:36,651 --> 01:19:37,260
if you wanted,

3055
01:19:37,260 --> 01:19:38,050
if you will,

3056
01:19:38,050 --> 01:19:38,970
what do you want to do it?

3057
01:19:38,971 --> 01:19:39,804
He goes,

3058
01:19:39,890 --> 01:19:40,730
what the fuck am I doing?

3059
01:19:41,060 --> 01:19:41,893
What am I doing?

3060
01:19:42,910 --> 01:19:45,620
I'm not talking to you about do you not
have enough going on in your life that

3061
01:19:45,621 --> 01:19:49,970
you need to focus on sparring and Balis
distracting himself with like tennis

3062
01:19:49,971 --> 01:19:50,751
lessons and all that.

3063
01:19:50,751 --> 01:19:52,100
She's shad lighting jokes,

3064
01:19:52,130 --> 01:19:55,760
no ship and he's out there
hitting myths and I do it all.

3065
01:19:56,360 --> 01:19:58,600
You do it all do help.

3066
01:19:58,610 --> 01:19:59,690
Tired is this guy.

3067
01:19:59,780 --> 01:20:01,490
I'm going to change this topic now,

3068
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:02,400
Tom,

3069
01:20:02,420 --> 01:20:03,650
nice take down the call,

3070
01:20:03,700 --> 01:20:04,533
running the pipe.

3071
01:20:04,690 --> 01:20:05,020
That's a good,

3072
01:20:05,020 --> 01:20:05,810
but it's going to take down.

3073
01:20:05,810 --> 01:20:06,201
Simple,

3074
01:20:06,201 --> 01:20:06,650
simple.

3075
01:20:06,650 --> 01:20:08,070
He's almost fucked to the simple

3076
01:20:08,190 --> 01:20:09,690
single legs slide on.

3077
01:20:09,700 --> 01:20:09,991
You guys.

3078
01:20:09,991 --> 01:20:11,550
Notice them out quietly.

3079
01:20:11,551 --> 01:20:13,530
Russians are just taking over.

3080
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:15,150
They're not regular white people.

3081
01:20:15,300 --> 01:20:15,840
They're not.

3082
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:20,580
They're just quietly taking shit over
culture that that puts masculine power at

3083
01:20:20,581 --> 01:20:21,300
a premium.

3084
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:22,770
Anthony Joshua would care to defer.

3085
01:20:24,270 --> 01:20:24,631
Hey Dude,

3086
01:20:24,631 --> 01:20:25,860
how about fucking personal?

3087
01:20:25,861 --> 01:20:27,240
Walked in the box and burn,

3088
01:20:27,750 --> 01:20:29,190
just walked in and was like,

3089
01:20:29,240 --> 01:20:29,421
shit,

3090
01:20:29,421 --> 01:20:29,990
that's cool.

3091
01:20:29,990 --> 01:20:34,590
Oh fucking just giant
dude checking things out.

3092
01:20:34,650 --> 01:20:36,000
I'm here to mix things up.

3093
01:20:36,060 --> 01:20:38,640
You wants to train cause his
girl ivy wants to train their,

3094
01:20:38,641 --> 01:20:38,911
you know,

3095
01:20:38,911 --> 01:20:40,500
just when he's doing things here in la.

3096
01:20:40,680 --> 01:20:43,340
Oh that's so that's going to be the
Jimmy works at I think so young.

3097
01:20:43,450 --> 01:20:45,690
She's tanks going to
working on a boxercise gym.

3098
01:20:46,050 --> 01:20:47,400
Well kind of.

3099
01:20:47,410 --> 01:20:48,121
I Conor Mcgregor,

3100
01:20:48,121 --> 01:20:49,500
we're talking to the wildcard.

3101
01:20:50,550 --> 01:20:50,970
I Dunno.

3102
01:20:50,970 --> 01:20:52,680
Maybe he doesn't want to
deal with all the bullshit.

3103
01:20:52,740 --> 01:20:53,011
Yeah,

3104
01:20:53,011 --> 01:20:53,810
that's true.

3105
01:20:53,810 --> 01:20:54,180
Yeah.

3106
01:20:54,180 --> 01:20:57,960
Cause box number and you can the shut
like for [inaudible] they shut it down.

3107
01:20:58,050 --> 01:20:58,501
I'll do that.

3108
01:20:58,501 --> 01:20:59,161
When I was in camp,

3109
01:20:59,161 --> 01:21:01,770
they'd literally shut the class
that they organize stuff around.

3110
01:21:01,830 --> 01:21:02,461
Oh interesting.

3111
01:21:02,461 --> 01:21:03,780
I was talking to West Chatham about,

3112
01:21:03,810 --> 01:21:04,290
he was like,

3113
01:21:04,290 --> 01:21:06,030
he would work at it wildcard west,

3114
01:21:06,031 --> 01:21:07,470
but every time he be,

3115
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:08,630
we're not somebody who would be like,

3116
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:09,473
you want to spar,

3117
01:21:09,750 --> 01:21:10,351
you want to sparring.

3118
01:21:10,351 --> 01:21:12,210
And it's like that's the culture there.

3119
01:21:12,250 --> 01:21:12,840
Yeah.

3120
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:13,441
That's tough.

3121
01:21:13,441 --> 01:21:14,370
When you just want to work out.

3122
01:21:14,371 --> 01:21:14,680
It's like,

3123
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:15,600
and he doesn't want to say no,

3124
01:21:15,601 --> 01:21:16,950
and I told you this before Brian,

3125
01:21:16,951 --> 01:21:17,491
because Brian was like,

3126
01:21:17,491 --> 01:21:18,470
I just want to get put out of spoiler.

3127
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:18,870
He went,

3128
01:21:18,870 --> 01:21:22,230
I want you to walk into wildcard west
and he'd get all the spike in handle.

3129
01:21:22,380 --> 01:21:24,270
Myra Lopez will punch you in the Dick.

3130
01:21:24,271 --> 01:21:26,430
So we'll punch you.

3131
01:21:26,460 --> 01:21:29,930
The Sopa Barn is Mario dues.

3132
01:21:29,950 --> 01:21:30,210
He's,

3133
01:21:30,210 --> 01:21:31,940
he's budge.

3134
01:21:32,050 --> 01:21:33,420
But do I worry about that?

3135
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:37,680
I worry about those guys that do that
recreational sparring and then all of a

3136
01:21:37,681 --> 01:21:39,240
sudden one day like where are my keys?

3137
01:21:39,270 --> 01:21:41,000
It doesn't make sense in my hand can hit.

3138
01:21:41,070 --> 01:21:42,450
It doesn't make sense to me.

3139
01:21:42,780 --> 01:21:43,613
Why are you doing?

3140
01:21:43,620 --> 01:21:44,291
Are you getting paid?

3141
01:21:44,291 --> 01:21:44,941
He in the head.

3142
01:21:44,941 --> 01:21:45,774
I don't get it.

3143
01:21:46,110 --> 01:21:47,310
I talked to him about it when,

3144
01:21:47,311 --> 01:21:47,730
um,

3145
01:21:47,730 --> 01:21:51,450
he fought one of our friends
from a 10th planet Jujitsu.

3146
01:21:51,570 --> 01:21:53,670
He's been boxing for a long time too.

3147
01:21:53,671 --> 01:21:55,440
I think it has been like,

3148
01:21:55,441 --> 01:21:59,040
legitimately he had an amateur
boxing match with a buddy of mine.

3149
01:22:00,550 --> 01:22:01,030
I just,

3150
01:22:01,030 --> 01:22:01,863
Yep.

3151
01:22:01,940 --> 01:22:02,360
I get,

3152
01:22:02,360 --> 01:22:02,911
it's fun.

3153
01:22:02,911 --> 01:22:04,920
You've got to test yourself and
maybe you know you're in TV,

3154
01:22:04,921 --> 01:22:06,600
so you've got to make sure
you still have your main card,

3155
01:22:06,601 --> 01:22:07,291
stuff like that.

3156
01:22:07,291 --> 01:22:09,030
But there's other ways to do it.

3157
01:22:09,060 --> 01:22:09,620
I just,

3158
01:22:09,620 --> 01:22:11,580
Jujitsu is the best way to
do it because you don't,

3159
01:22:11,610 --> 01:22:12,180
you don't,

3160
01:22:12,180 --> 01:22:13,410
you don't get the brain damage,

3161
01:22:13,411 --> 01:22:16,530
but a lot of guys don't like the damage
to your neck and your knees and your

3162
01:22:16,531 --> 01:22:18,120
joints and your back.

3163
01:22:18,510 --> 01:22:19,080
I don't know.

3164
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:19,280
There's,

3165
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:20,790
that's a personality thing too.

3166
01:22:20,791 --> 01:22:23,640
I think Stryker's a lot of times
have different personalities.

3167
01:22:23,641 --> 01:22:24,960
I'm talking about guys who do it.

3168
01:22:25,230 --> 01:22:26,850
Like the difference between a striker,

3169
01:22:26,940 --> 01:22:28,680
pure striker and a pure wrestler.

3170
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:30,330
There's actually a personality difference.

3171
01:22:30,331 --> 01:22:32,850
I think sometimes maybe it's also like,

3172
01:22:32,970 --> 01:22:33,241
you know,

3173
01:22:33,241 --> 01:22:37,920
a lot of guys who could have been big
time or would have really gotten big time

3174
01:22:37,921 --> 01:22:38,754
into striking.

3175
01:22:38,820 --> 01:22:41,520
They found Jujitsu first and
they've got big time into Jujitsu.

3176
01:22:42,750 --> 01:22:43,620
It depends with that look,

3177
01:22:43,621 --> 01:22:46,890
I loved both of them and I love
striking and I loved it all.

3178
01:22:47,130 --> 01:22:48,090
I loved Jujitsu.

3179
01:22:48,930 --> 01:22:49,261
I mean,

3180
01:22:49,261 --> 01:22:54,261
I think that the difference in striking
clearly is that you can get hit and hurt

3181
01:22:54,850 --> 01:22:57,080
and you get hit a little bit in Jujitsu,

3182
01:22:57,140 --> 01:22:59,770
QED but each other and run into the shit.

3183
01:23:01,110 --> 01:23:01,921
Do you know what I would've done?

3184
01:23:01,921 --> 01:23:03,450
And I'm not being funny here.

3185
01:23:04,110 --> 01:23:06,000
If you put me in a time and I was like

3186
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:10,700
say 1814 I'm not kidding
with trade and last thing.

3187
01:23:10,750 --> 01:23:11,530
Are you kidding?

3188
01:23:11,530 --> 01:23:11,771
Yeah.

3189
01:23:11,771 --> 01:23:12,750
I tried it and run slang,

3190
01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:13,421
taekwondo,

3191
01:23:13,421 --> 01:23:13,951
all this up.

3192
01:23:13,951 --> 01:23:14,591
I would be,

3193
01:23:14,591 --> 01:23:15,970
I would be practicing an instrument.

3194
01:23:16,060 --> 01:23:18,130
I would be a great
dancer and I would sing,

3195
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:22,740
just want to get distracted by pussy
and he would start doing stand up.

3196
01:23:25,420 --> 01:23:26,560
I don't think you would do that.

3197
01:23:26,561 --> 01:23:28,450
Be Maybe I had to be a fighter.

3198
01:23:28,451 --> 01:23:29,284
I think.

3199
01:23:29,650 --> 01:23:30,190
No,

3200
01:23:30,190 --> 01:23:31,870
cause I I knowing what I know now,

3201
01:23:31,871 --> 01:23:32,950
I don't have that now.

3202
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:36,370
Dancing w you fucked up by
not singing and dancing.

3203
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:37,233
Look at me.

3204
01:23:37,540 --> 01:23:39,920
I would have been great dancing,

3205
01:23:40,690 --> 01:23:41,523
dancing,

3206
01:23:41,830 --> 01:23:42,191
singing.

3207
01:23:42,191 --> 01:23:43,330
I was singing it.

3208
01:23:43,340 --> 01:23:44,320
Something you can work at,

3209
01:23:44,350 --> 01:23:45,880
and I'm not talking about
being it's white singer.

3210
01:23:46,330 --> 01:23:47,120
I'm not talking about being,

3211
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:47,953
no,

3212
01:23:47,970 --> 01:23:48,730
you're wrong,

3213
01:23:48,730 --> 01:23:49,061
you're wrong.

3214
01:23:49,061 --> 01:23:49,751
You're completely wrong.

3215
01:23:49,751 --> 01:23:50,050
Yes,

3216
01:23:50,050 --> 01:23:51,340
some people have amazing instruments,

3217
01:23:51,341 --> 01:23:53,710
but you can become a very good
singer just with training.

3218
01:23:53,730 --> 01:23:54,221
But believe me,

3219
01:23:54,221 --> 01:23:54,720
you can,

3220
01:23:54,720 --> 01:23:59,230
especially if you could translate into
being good singer has to be a dick.

3221
01:23:59,231 --> 01:24:00,064
But I,

3222
01:24:00,210 --> 01:24:02,860
I did sing it when in theater school.

3223
01:24:03,130 --> 01:24:04,610
Like I got to a point where I could,

3224
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:05,800
I wouldn't hurt your ears.

3225
01:24:05,801 --> 01:24:06,730
I mean it's not song.

3226
01:24:06,731 --> 01:24:07,420
Did you sing?

3227
01:24:07,420 --> 01:24:07,851
I don't know.

3228
01:24:07,851 --> 01:24:09,370
I sang all the musicals and stuff.

3229
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:11,230
Gimme gimme a couple notes.

3230
01:24:11,231 --> 01:24:11,981
I'm like a,

3231
01:24:11,981 --> 01:24:13,210
I sang into the woods.

3232
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:15,860
No mortgage giants saint a little bit.

3233
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:16,450
No,

3234
01:24:16,450 --> 01:24:18,360
come on a little bit cause I'm it,

3235
01:24:18,380 --> 01:24:19,630
it'll move you to tears.

3236
01:24:19,660 --> 01:24:20,493
Come on.

3237
01:24:20,620 --> 01:24:21,453
I can't,

3238
01:24:21,610 --> 01:24:22,900
I can't just,

3239
01:24:23,140 --> 01:24:28,140
I picked you as a country
western music inside of me.

3240
01:24:28,450 --> 01:24:31,750
I picture you're doing like a cover
of like some Hank Williams Jr.

3241
01:24:31,870 --> 01:24:32,361
No Dude,

3242
01:24:32,361 --> 01:24:33,194
I don't sing country.

3243
01:24:33,930 --> 01:24:36,300
Don't like country new kids on the block.

3244
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:36,730
No,

3245
01:24:36,730 --> 01:24:37,030
no.

3246
01:24:37,030 --> 01:24:37,480
Listen,

3247
01:24:37,480 --> 01:24:38,950
some people like have great voices,

3248
01:24:38,951 --> 01:24:41,380
but you gotta remember Justin Timberlake's
been singing since he was a little

3249
01:24:41,381 --> 01:24:42,940
kid born with a lot of town though.

3250
01:24:43,090 --> 01:24:44,410
It's been saying since
he was a little kid.

3251
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:47,380
And toweling talent though talent,

3252
01:24:47,381 --> 01:24:51,700
but also like this is that
I wish I could go wrong.

3253
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:53,190
Bron James,

3254
01:24:53,190 --> 01:24:53,441
I don't know.

3255
01:24:53,441 --> 01:24:53,990
Hold on.

3256
01:24:53,990 --> 01:24:54,940
It's actually very different.

3257
01:24:55,030 --> 01:24:55,660
I'm sorry.

3258
01:24:55,660 --> 01:24:56,471
Yes there's talent,

3259
01:24:56,471 --> 01:24:56,860
but there's all,

3260
01:24:56,860 --> 01:24:57,790
there's timing and common,

3261
01:24:58,030 --> 01:25:01,040
but like singing and dancing is something
that when you've been doing since a

3262
01:25:01,041 --> 01:25:02,770
little kid like that,

3263
01:25:02,860 --> 01:25:06,280
that the reason that he's so good
is that's been trained into it.

3264
01:25:06,281 --> 01:25:08,020
He also has tenant
though be he has talent.

3265
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:11,020
A lot of people definitely have talent,

3266
01:25:11,021 --> 01:25:13,240
but I think what Brian is saying
is that you can get better.

3267
01:25:13,300 --> 01:25:13,471
Oh,

3268
01:25:13,471 --> 01:25:14,290
for sure.

3269
01:25:14,290 --> 01:25:17,170
With coaching and I think
that it's also a muscle,

3270
01:25:17,650 --> 01:25:18,070
isn't it?

3271
01:25:18,070 --> 01:25:19,990
Throat your throat to 100% of muscle,

3272
01:25:19,991 --> 01:25:20,340
so,

3273
01:25:20,340 --> 01:25:21,021
so you,

3274
01:25:21,021 --> 01:25:25,570
you can get to be 100% of us so that
you can get very good and very powerful

3275
01:25:25,571 --> 01:25:26,350
with your voice.

3276
01:25:26,350 --> 01:25:28,810
I just know too many
Broadway singers and dancers,

3277
01:25:28,811 --> 01:25:31,840
the amount of practice that
they put in from early ages,

3278
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:32,770
it's,

3279
01:25:32,770 --> 01:25:33,401
it's a very,

3280
01:25:33,401 --> 01:25:34,910
very physical products.

3281
01:25:34,990 --> 01:25:36,490
Like the opera is the
same way and I agree.

3282
01:25:36,491 --> 01:25:37,720
You can practice being get better,

3283
01:25:37,721 --> 01:25:39,250
but don't you think a
lot of those singers,

3284
01:25:39,430 --> 01:25:40,261
they're pinched,

3285
01:25:40,261 --> 01:25:41,500
learned from a very young age?

3286
01:25:41,501 --> 01:25:43,490
They were performers like
they were good at seashore.

3287
01:25:43,540 --> 01:25:43,890
I mean,

3288
01:25:43,890 --> 01:25:44,723
look,

3289
01:25:45,150 --> 01:25:46,200
probably not for you.

3290
01:25:46,340 --> 01:25:49,780
And even if even if Michael Jackson
helped him sing all his life,

3291
01:25:49,781 --> 01:25:51,140
he's not going to be
a professional singer.

3292
01:25:51,160 --> 01:25:52,270
So my Brummie lessons,

3293
01:25:52,271 --> 01:25:53,590
Adele had my exam it up.

3294
01:25:54,220 --> 01:25:54,530
Well,

3295
01:25:54,530 --> 01:25:55,720
she's very special,

3296
01:25:55,721 --> 01:25:57,310
but she also was only singing.

3297
01:25:57,340 --> 01:25:58,870
She also makes money doing it,

3298
01:25:59,030 --> 01:25:59,261
but,

3299
01:25:59,261 --> 01:25:59,441
but,

3300
01:25:59,441 --> 01:26:00,221
but some people are very,

3301
01:26:00,221 --> 01:26:00,671
very special.

3302
01:26:00,671 --> 01:26:01,241
But like,

3303
01:26:01,241 --> 01:26:02,074
um,

3304
01:26:02,530 --> 01:26:03,230
my grandfather,

3305
01:26:03,230 --> 01:26:07,850
when I did a musical and my grandfather
taught me do a musical and I was 22 or

3306
01:26:07,851 --> 01:26:08,121
whatever,

3307
01:26:08,121 --> 01:26:08,750
and he said to me,

3308
01:26:08,750 --> 01:26:09,320
it was great.

3309
01:26:09,320 --> 01:26:10,580
It's a Sicilian from Brooklyn,

3310
01:26:10,700 --> 01:26:11,331
no nonsense.

3311
01:26:11,331 --> 01:26:11,870
He goes,

3312
01:26:11,870 --> 01:26:12,703
listen to me,

3313
01:26:12,710 --> 01:26:13,310
you're funny.

3314
01:26:13,310 --> 01:26:14,960
You made them all laugh with your antics.

3315
01:26:15,230 --> 01:26:16,670
You'll never going to make
it living as a singer.

3316
01:26:16,970 --> 01:26:17,690
Don't sing.

3317
01:26:17,690 --> 01:26:20,420
Don't waste your time on this now I
had only been singing for the year.

3318
01:26:20,450 --> 01:26:21,890
Like I said,

3319
01:26:22,730 --> 01:26:24,560
how about I show you fuck face,

3320
01:26:24,590 --> 01:26:26,180
and then you start singing in his face,

3321
01:26:27,950 --> 01:26:29,460
fucking son on la La,

3322
01:26:29,461 --> 01:26:29,680
la,

3323
01:26:29,680 --> 01:26:29,961
la,

3324
01:26:29,961 --> 01:26:30,794
la.

3325
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:32,840
Here's that fucking bullshit.

3326
01:26:32,841 --> 01:26:33,800
Logan interested,

3327
01:26:34,010 --> 01:26:34,843
not interested.

3328
01:26:35,300 --> 01:26:37,660
Don't let the little girls and girls will,

3329
01:26:37,730 --> 01:26:38,061
she's,

3330
01:26:38,061 --> 01:26:38,241
yeah,

3331
01:26:38,241 --> 01:26:39,650
she's the best thing in
the movement or not to it.

3332
01:26:39,651 --> 01:26:41,270
It looks pretty good
as high octane action.

3333
01:26:41,271 --> 01:26:42,080
That's what they just said.

3334
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:44,660
Mel asked you this when
he got jacked for Logan,

3335
01:26:44,690 --> 01:26:45,920
how many steroids did he do?

3336
01:26:45,921 --> 01:26:46,570
All of them.

3337
01:26:46,570 --> 01:26:46,740
Hey,

3338
01:26:46,740 --> 01:26:47,070
you know,

3339
01:26:47,070 --> 01:26:48,510
hey it muscle fitness,

3340
01:26:48,790 --> 01:26:49,910
this is muscle and fitness.

3341
01:26:49,911 --> 01:26:50,480
He goes,

3342
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:50,721
you know,

3343
01:26:50,721 --> 01:26:52,220
when I got the Wolverine Role,

3344
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:54,290
I knew I need to put on some muscle.

3345
01:26:54,290 --> 01:26:58,220
So I called up the one guy who knows about
this and a rock sent me his Dietitian

3346
01:26:58,221 --> 01:27:01,080
and I got in his diet and I
went to the boat and winstrol.

3347
01:27:01,140 --> 01:27:03,860
How's that work in grass fed beef?

3348
01:27:04,460 --> 01:27:08,090
Is it just pure red meat and
testosterone or he's got a big frame.

3349
01:27:08,120 --> 01:27:08,271
I mean,

3350
01:27:08,271 --> 01:27:10,150
he's six [inaudible] six for a big guy.

3351
01:27:10,230 --> 01:27:11,510
He's a big guy for sure,

3352
01:27:11,690 --> 01:27:13,070
but I mean he got

3353
01:27:14,850 --> 01:27:15,683
that.

3354
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:17,870
You don't get that kind of
vascularity in your forties,

3355
01:27:18,020 --> 01:27:18,970
unless you're Brian Callum.

3356
01:27:18,971 --> 01:27:19,570
You know what?

3357
01:27:19,570 --> 01:27:22,240
There's a picture of him that's
not even the best picture.

3358
01:27:22,241 --> 01:27:23,590
It's Christ photo shopped a little bit,

3359
01:27:23,620 --> 01:27:24,231
but oh,

3360
01:27:24,231 --> 01:27:25,011
I don't know about that.

3361
01:27:25,011 --> 01:27:28,170
I mean the veins and one that's a little
Photoshop is a little photo shoot.

3362
01:27:28,180 --> 01:27:28,400
There's,

3363
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:28,700
there's,

3364
01:27:28,700 --> 01:27:31,190
there's pictures of him
legitimately in the gym.

3365
01:27:31,191 --> 01:27:31,970
Lifting weights.

3366
01:27:31,970 --> 01:27:35,210
Muscle is not as big there
as he was in the other ones,

3367
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:36,310
but that vast so,

3368
01:27:36,530 --> 01:27:38,520
and some movies he got bigger and not mad,

3369
01:27:39,480 --> 01:27:41,570
but that's probably as legit as it gets.

3370
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:43,900
Really mad men.

3371
01:27:43,980 --> 01:27:44,813
Yeah.

3372
01:27:44,990 --> 01:27:46,640
There's some that with him lifting,

3373
01:27:46,790 --> 01:27:48,350
there's one of him dead lifting.

3374
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:50,900
See if he could find Hugh
Jackman dead lifting.

3375
01:27:52,550 --> 01:27:53,383
I think he's kind of,

3376
01:27:53,890 --> 01:27:54,620
um,

3377
01:27:54,620 --> 01:27:57,740
a comment on that is in the pool.

3378
01:27:58,010 --> 01:27:59,330
I'll get that some bullshit there.

3379
01:27:59,331 --> 01:28:00,480
That looks like here.

3380
01:28:00,490 --> 01:28:01,330
That normal deluxe,

3381
01:28:01,730 --> 01:28:02,563
one of them dead,

3382
01:28:02,580 --> 01:28:03,413
lifted,

3383
01:28:03,810 --> 01:28:07,190
jacked that we'll ring
you them right there.

3384
01:28:08,150 --> 01:28:08,983
Yeah.

3385
01:28:09,910 --> 01:28:11,000
He's lifted in some real weight.

3386
01:28:11,390 --> 01:28:12,710
I mean that's the way to get bigger man.

3387
01:28:12,740 --> 01:28:13,311
You want to get bigger?

3388
01:28:13,311 --> 01:28:14,144
You've got to dead lift.

3389
01:28:14,180 --> 01:28:14,500
Yeah.

3390
01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:15,860
Della always say Joe,

3391
01:28:16,430 --> 01:28:17,120
is that what you always say?

3392
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:18,890
Always you?

3393
01:28:20,390 --> 01:28:21,320
What's up son?

3394
01:28:21,620 --> 01:28:22,310
Hey,

3395
01:28:22,310 --> 01:28:25,660
good body wearing jean shorts
while you're fucking ideas being a

3396
01:28:25,661 --> 01:28:26,494
multimillionaire.

3397
01:28:26,910 --> 01:28:27,743
That's what he breathes.

3398
01:28:28,130 --> 01:28:28,963
Daisy dukes.

3399
01:28:29,060 --> 01:28:31,400
That's a tough thing to
pull off today as a guy.

3400
01:28:31,460 --> 01:28:32,293
Yeah.

3401
01:28:32,910 --> 01:28:37,100
I was off third street yesterday and just
every girl had her ass cheeks out like

3402
01:28:37,101 --> 01:28:40,730
these short short shorts or in his
bitches aren't playing ass or non like God

3403
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:42,590
damn bitch bitches harm planning,

3404
01:28:42,610 --> 01:28:43,130
not planning.

3405
01:28:43,130 --> 01:28:46,190
They tried to sell that pussy
white girls with flat rock gum,

3406
01:28:46,191 --> 01:28:47,024
just whatever.

3407
01:28:47,160 --> 01:28:48,710
Who can sing and dance that guy.

3408
01:28:48,820 --> 01:28:50,510
He changes the subject.

3409
01:28:50,540 --> 01:28:50,680
Oh,

3410
01:28:50,680 --> 01:28:51,513
sorry.

3411
01:28:51,640 --> 01:28:52,580
I want to go back to muscles.

3412
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:54,470
All your boy Ben Saunders,

3413
01:28:55,250 --> 01:28:56,350
Saunders a Peter Sabato.

3414
01:28:56,360 --> 01:28:57,020
That's a good fight.

3415
01:28:57,020 --> 01:29:01,350
Biggest one 70 and the world's tallest
six two and he's definitely not,

3416
01:29:01,590 --> 01:29:04,300
but he looked talking
say Damien Maia is big.

3417
01:29:04,670 --> 01:29:05,150
Yeah,

3418
01:29:05,150 --> 01:29:05,460
yeah.

3419
01:29:05,460 --> 01:29:06,060
Oh my God.

3420
01:29:06,060 --> 01:29:07,770
You want me to just find the 85 wow.

3421
01:29:08,390 --> 01:29:08,890
Yeah.

3422
01:29:08,890 --> 01:29:10,230
Damien is going to be in town soon.

3423
01:29:10,260 --> 01:29:11,490
We'll try to get them on the podcast.

3424
01:29:11,491 --> 01:29:12,211
That'd be great.

3425
01:29:12,211 --> 01:29:12,600
Yeah.

3426
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:14,670
His English isn't phenomenal the best,

3427
01:29:14,671 --> 01:29:15,900
but it's good enough.

3428
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:19,050
It's outside board doesn't be
great and just it was good enough.

3429
01:29:19,110 --> 01:29:19,770
We'll cyborg.

3430
01:29:19,770 --> 01:29:21,120
You brought her in with her boyfriend,

3431
01:29:21,121 --> 01:29:21,450
right?

3432
01:29:21,450 --> 01:29:22,283
Yeah.

3433
01:29:22,620 --> 01:29:26,010
Did you see what Brian Stan did to a
towering whittling when they were talking

3434
01:29:26,011 --> 01:29:26,400
about,

3435
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:26,790
uh,

3436
01:29:26,790 --> 01:29:27,090
when?

3437
01:29:27,090 --> 01:29:28,320
When after he won,

3438
01:29:28,350 --> 01:29:29,183
um,

3439
01:29:29,190 --> 01:29:29,720
what's his name?

3440
01:29:29,720 --> 01:29:31,120
One fucking,

3441
01:29:31,150 --> 01:29:31,320
I'm,

3442
01:29:31,320 --> 01:29:31,580
I'm,

3443
01:29:31,580 --> 01:29:34,950
I'm seeing ally Damien Maia and a prion.

3444
01:29:34,951 --> 01:29:37,560
Stan took a nap sack and
put it on his back and then,

3445
01:29:37,590 --> 01:29:38,361
then Brian Santa Go,

3446
01:29:38,361 --> 01:29:38,560
Nah,

3447
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:38,911
forget that.

3448
01:29:38,911 --> 01:29:40,680
And Aztec and he just
jumped on his back of his,

3449
01:29:40,681 --> 01:29:40,870
this,

3450
01:29:40,870 --> 01:29:43,980
what's going to feel like it used to this
and tell who at least holding them in

3451
01:29:43,981 --> 01:29:44,401
a suit.

3452
01:29:44,401 --> 01:29:44,600
It was,

3453
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:45,840
we see what Tyron Woodley did.

3454
01:29:45,900 --> 01:29:48,420
He made a video of him preparing
for the Damien Maia fight.

3455
01:29:48,421 --> 01:29:51,700
He put a backpack on and went through
his entire workout with a backpack on.

3456
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:52,440
Right.

3457
01:29:52,440 --> 01:29:53,210
That's great.

3458
01:29:53,210 --> 01:29:53,900
Yeah.

3459
01:29:53,900 --> 01:29:54,250
Do you,

3460
01:29:54,250 --> 01:29:55,380
what do you mean don't do random?

3461
01:29:55,381 --> 01:29:56,790
He said Jermaine Duran.

3462
01:29:56,791 --> 01:29:57,930
It'd be said she's not fighting.

3463
01:29:57,931 --> 01:29:58,764
Cyborg.

3464
01:29:59,820 --> 01:30:00,930
Cyborg is a cheater.

3465
01:30:00,931 --> 01:30:01,280
She's is,

3466
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:02,460
she's a known cheater.

3467
01:30:02,670 --> 01:30:03,031
She said,

3468
01:30:03,031 --> 01:30:04,350
I can't trust her to not cheat,

3469
01:30:04,380 --> 01:30:06,230
cheated or hope so scared.

3470
01:30:06,240 --> 01:30:09,760
Defend the belt after just
a little bit of a cop out.

3471
01:30:09,780 --> 01:30:10,290
It doesn't it?

3472
01:30:10,290 --> 01:30:14,130
Cause I mean when was the last time
cyber got caught in 2012 here's tiring

3473
01:30:14,160 --> 01:30:15,490
working out with the backpack on.

3474
01:30:15,660 --> 01:30:16,340
It's funny.

3475
01:30:16,340 --> 01:30:17,910
That's where the fuck your backup.

3476
01:30:17,940 --> 01:30:18,751
That's when I really,

3477
01:30:18,751 --> 01:30:20,850
there's no weight and that
it's just got some clothes.

3478
01:30:21,650 --> 01:30:22,560
He's just joking around.

3479
01:30:23,310 --> 01:30:24,400
Just not a good way to work.

3480
01:30:24,650 --> 01:30:25,920
I work out with a backpack on.

3481
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:27,750
I have a specific backpack.

3482
01:30:27,751 --> 01:30:31,110
This design by this company called the
outdoorsman that actually holds a weight

3483
01:30:31,111 --> 01:30:31,710
plate on it.

3484
01:30:31,710 --> 01:30:32,040
Oh yeah.

3485
01:30:32,040 --> 01:30:33,150
Look at Olympic barbell.

3486
01:30:33,151 --> 01:30:34,590
Please send me all this shit.

3487
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:36,113
I'll send it to you.

3488
01:30:36,180 --> 01:30:37,110
But they have um,

3489
01:30:38,150 --> 01:30:38,810
uh,

3490
01:30:38,810 --> 01:30:40,440
a thing on it where it's six on the back,

3491
01:30:40,470 --> 01:30:41,280
actually have tool.

3492
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:42,300
I'll give you one please.

3493
01:30:42,330 --> 01:30:45,870
And you put a weight plate on and it
clamps down just like that's just like a

3494
01:30:45,871 --> 01:30:47,310
bar and I'll use the weighted vest.

3495
01:30:47,311 --> 01:30:48,000
It's not great.

3496
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:48,810
Not as good.

3497
01:30:48,810 --> 01:30:50,340
You can get 90 pounds on this fucker.

3498
01:30:50,360 --> 01:30:50,700
Damn.

3499
01:30:50,700 --> 01:30:53,460
So I need it for the stairs to see
if you could find one of those two.

3500
01:30:53,461 --> 01:30:53,761
How bad.

3501
01:30:53,761 --> 01:30:54,760
I fucked my uh,

3502
01:30:54,840 --> 01:30:55,673
knee up.

3503
01:30:55,710 --> 01:30:56,490
I fucked my knee up.

3504
01:30:56,490 --> 01:30:56,591
What?

3505
01:30:56,591 --> 01:30:57,421
I've been run so much,

3506
01:30:57,421 --> 01:30:59,130
it just hurts and I was running yesterday.

3507
01:30:59,310 --> 01:30:59,811
I text,

3508
01:30:59,811 --> 01:31:00,450
can we go,

3509
01:31:00,450 --> 01:31:00,751
hey man,

3510
01:31:00,751 --> 01:31:02,940
I'm putting a lot of miles and you
know I'm doing like six miles a day.

3511
01:31:02,941 --> 01:31:03,774
Write in every day.

3512
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:05,060
I'm going to put a lot of miles in man.

3513
01:31:05,070 --> 01:31:06,090
Like my knee hurts.

3514
01:31:06,091 --> 01:31:06,661
What do you do?

3515
01:31:06,661 --> 01:31:07,494
He Goes Ah,

3516
01:31:07,530 --> 01:31:09,120
if it takes like six hours,

3517
01:31:09,121 --> 01:31:09,960
cause he's probably killing,

3518
01:31:09,961 --> 01:31:11,040
shoot some beer in the face.

3519
01:31:11,100 --> 01:31:11,580
He was,

3520
01:31:11,580 --> 01:31:12,210
yeah he was,

3521
01:31:12,210 --> 01:31:14,130
he texts me back is uh yeah.

3522
01:31:14,160 --> 01:31:15,420
Induced from time to time.

3523
01:31:15,421 --> 01:31:18,660
I kind of just suck up and power
through and that's all he does.

3524
01:31:19,170 --> 01:31:20,003
Oh cool man.

3525
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:21,620
Here's what I'll do.

3526
01:31:21,720 --> 01:31:23,700
Sleeps four hours a night
and never gets sick.

3527
01:31:24,240 --> 01:31:25,073
He's just a freak.

3528
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:26,820
She's eaten moose meat every day too.

3529
01:31:27,240 --> 01:31:28,470
Well I don't think that hurts.

3530
01:31:28,530 --> 01:31:30,810
He eats bear three days a week.

3531
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:31,721
He's just an animal.

3532
01:31:31,721 --> 01:31:32,880
I feel like that's really good for you.

3533
01:31:32,910 --> 01:31:36,990
I just need to lose out some way to
from a run as much as I lose a little

3534
01:31:36,991 --> 01:31:37,230
weight.

3535
01:31:37,230 --> 01:31:41,790
I feel like this one thing that is legit
about what cam is doing is not just his

3536
01:31:41,791 --> 01:31:43,590
mental toughness is undeniable.

3537
01:31:43,591 --> 01:31:44,400
His work ethic,

3538
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:45,151
undeniable.

3539
01:31:45,151 --> 01:31:46,470
The fact that he's been running forever,

3540
01:31:46,471 --> 01:31:47,304
undeniable.

3541
01:31:48,180 --> 01:31:49,380
He eats wild game.

3542
01:31:49,381 --> 01:31:50,970
His shirts are so gay.

3543
01:31:51,180 --> 01:31:52,950
I keep telling him this,

3544
01:31:52,951 --> 01:31:55,260
you cannot cut your shirt down to this.

3545
01:31:55,261 --> 01:31:56,490
I know you live in Oregon,

3546
01:31:56,730 --> 01:31:58,780
but if you come to California
and she got dressed like,

3547
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,050
cause he was taking your mouth
while you're on the bench.

3548
01:32:01,900 --> 01:32:02,250
He has,

3549
01:32:02,250 --> 01:32:03,150
he has the like the,

3550
01:32:03,240 --> 01:32:04,150
you know the skin.

3551
01:32:04,710 --> 01:32:05,120
Oh boy.

3552
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:08,740
Like he cuts them like they like to
see my canon was tits out the back.

3553
01:32:08,741 --> 01:32:09,041
I'm like,

3554
01:32:09,041 --> 01:32:09,460
Bro,

3555
01:32:09,460 --> 01:32:11,110
you do that here on promise,

3556
01:32:11,111 --> 01:32:12,010
you and your Dick in her mouth.

3557
01:32:12,050 --> 01:32:13,210
You can't go to cams.

3558
01:32:13,211 --> 01:32:13,810
Um,

3559
01:32:13,810 --> 01:32:14,381
go to camps,

3560
01:32:14,381 --> 01:32:16,240
Instagram stories and his boy like,

3561
01:32:16,290 --> 01:32:16,890
yeah,

3562
01:32:16,890 --> 01:32:21,130
bumping chests and they both had
the same tea on the tee tank.

3563
01:32:22,710 --> 01:32:23,381
You'll love this.

3564
01:32:23,381 --> 01:32:24,214
Be Really,

3565
01:32:24,250 --> 01:32:24,401
yeah,

3566
01:32:24,401 --> 01:32:26,530
you can do a love the Instagram story.

3567
01:32:26,531 --> 01:32:26,981
That's right.

3568
01:32:26,981 --> 01:32:30,100
See if you can find pictures
of him working out on it is,

3569
01:32:31,490 --> 01:32:32,380
but here I'll find it.

3570
01:32:32,381 --> 01:32:35,320
There's tons of pictures on his Instagram.

3571
01:32:35,321 --> 01:32:36,850
Stories are pretty ridiculous though.

3572
01:32:37,270 --> 01:32:37,811
He can,

3573
01:32:37,811 --> 01:32:38,290
if he listened,

3574
01:32:38,290 --> 01:32:41,170
let's stop wearing the cut the shit buddy.

3575
01:32:41,171 --> 01:32:41,590
Hey Bro,

3576
01:32:41,590 --> 01:32:46,250
you do that here in La and here we go in
the mouth and it says it's meat so that

3577
01:32:47,950 --> 01:32:48,641
it's not a bad,

3578
01:32:48,641 --> 01:32:49,080
uh,

3579
01:32:49,080 --> 01:32:50,480
I mean he looks at every game,

3580
01:32:50,481 --> 01:32:51,380
man's Geranium,

3581
01:32:51,381 --> 01:32:52,570
every sure it's meat.

3582
01:32:52,760 --> 01:32:53,290
It's meat,

3583
01:32:53,290 --> 01:32:53,771
sir.

3584
01:32:53,771 --> 01:32:54,401
Do you know what that is?

3585
01:32:54,401 --> 01:32:55,240
Meets her is from,

3586
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:57,070
it's a quote by John Mayer,

3587
01:32:57,071 --> 01:32:58,120
which is even more gay.

3588
01:32:58,380 --> 01:32:58,900
Uh,

3589
01:32:58,900 --> 01:33:00,220
John Mayer was on a,

3590
01:33:00,221 --> 01:33:00,910
um,

3591
01:33:00,910 --> 01:33:05,110
some sort of a radio show and they
were asking them about what he eats.

3592
01:33:05,111 --> 01:33:06,700
He was in Montana and he's like,

3593
01:33:06,701 --> 01:33:06,911
well,

3594
01:33:06,911 --> 01:33:08,980
I have some friends and
they cook wild game.

3595
01:33:08,981 --> 01:33:09,480
And he's like,

3596
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:09,600
well,

3597
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:10,151
how do you cook it?

3598
01:33:10,151 --> 01:33:10,630
He goes,

3599
01:33:10,630 --> 01:33:11,590
it's meets her,

3600
01:33:12,250 --> 01:33:12,970
you cook it,

3601
01:33:12,970 --> 01:33:13,480
you just,

3602
01:33:13,480 --> 01:33:13,691
you know,

3603
01:33:13,691 --> 01:33:16,960
he could get on a grill since he's
the song bird of our generation.

3604
01:33:16,980 --> 01:33:18,700
So you guys watch your fucking mouth?

3605
01:33:18,730 --> 01:33:19,990
Not really anymore.

3606
01:33:20,090 --> 01:33:22,420
He's committee go kind of fell off,

3607
01:33:22,950 --> 01:33:25,180
came to get me started
talking shit about girls.

3608
01:33:25,181 --> 01:33:26,430
You fucked like,

3609
01:33:26,431 --> 01:33:28,160
like Jessica Simpson and Shitty.

3610
01:33:28,180 --> 01:33:32,030
Did some interviews and he was like
dishing and they lost a lot of respect

3611
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:35,260
because he's the guy
who bought his London.

3612
01:33:36,370 --> 01:33:38,130
Everybody wants to thinks
he's just roll mill manager.

3613
01:33:38,150 --> 01:33:38,983
These guys.

3614
01:33:40,790 --> 01:33:41,770
It'd be good to my daughter.

3615
01:33:41,771 --> 01:33:42,461
You piece of shit.

3616
01:33:42,461 --> 01:33:43,294
Fuck.

3617
01:33:43,960 --> 01:33:44,860
Fuck you John.

3618
01:33:44,861 --> 01:33:45,694
Man.

3619
01:33:45,870 --> 01:33:46,750
He was so talented.

3620
01:33:47,110 --> 01:33:48,160
10th Planet Jiu Jitsu.

3621
01:33:48,161 --> 01:33:49,810
Ben Saunders ready to go down.

3622
01:33:49,930 --> 01:33:51,460
Dan Waiting at one 68,

3623
01:33:52,630 --> 01:33:53,060

3624

two bit of six to every bit of six ps.

3625
01:33:55,211 --> 01:33:57,110
One of the nicest guys on the planet.

3626
01:33:57,111 --> 01:33:57,400
All right,

3627
01:33:57,400 --> 01:33:58,180

3628
01:33:58,180 --> 01:33:58,471
Yeah,

3629
01:33:58,471 --> 01:33:59,304
I love Ben.

3630
01:33:59,380 --> 01:34:00,730
He's a fucking great guy.

3631
01:34:00,910 --> 01:34:01,450
Oh,

3632
01:34:01,450 --> 01:34:02,261
I can't wait for the main,

3633
01:34:02,261 --> 01:34:04,450
if he's got a nasty fucking guard too,

3634
01:34:04,451 --> 01:34:04,930
man.

3635
01:34:04,930 --> 01:34:06,400
Nasty guard.

3636
01:34:06,910 --> 01:34:09,460
If you don't know what you're doing
and Ben Saunders wraps you up,

3637
01:34:09,461 --> 01:34:10,294
he's going to put you,

3638
01:34:10,390 --> 01:34:12,190
is going to put you in some bad positions.

3639
01:34:12,240 --> 01:34:13,011
Let's see what Peter said.

3640
01:34:13,011 --> 01:34:13,160
Bought.

3641
01:34:13,160 --> 01:34:14,110
I could do about that.

3642
01:34:14,210 --> 01:34:14,970
Darcy,

3643
01:34:14,970 --> 01:34:16,470
what is that Eddie Bravo doing is he's,

3644
01:34:16,471 --> 01:34:16,961
he's in town.

3645
01:34:16,961 --> 01:34:17,860
He's in Singapore.

3646
01:34:18,310 --> 01:34:20,200
He was doing a super camp.

3647
01:34:20,260 --> 01:34:21,011
It was over there,

3648
01:34:21,011 --> 01:34:23,490
a teaching Jujitsu and um,

3649
01:34:23,620 --> 01:34:26,770
then he was there for the one fc event,

3650
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:30,880
which a fucking Ben aspirins
still undefeated now.

3651
01:34:30,881 --> 01:34:31,481
16.

3652
01:34:31,481 --> 01:34:31,630
And,

3653
01:34:31,630 --> 01:34:32,820
oh Jesus Christ.

3654
01:34:33,730 --> 01:34:35,410
Bring him over here please.

3655
01:34:35,411 --> 01:34:36,490
While you still can fight,

3656
01:34:36,491 --> 01:34:37,230
you think he said,

3657
01:34:37,230 --> 01:34:37,690
hey,

3658
01:34:37,690 --> 01:34:40,000
you signed a fucking soccer.

3659
01:34:40,001 --> 01:34:41,230
What's a gold car?

3660
01:34:41,250 --> 01:34:43,150
Go can cycle cotton
socks will being great.

3661
01:34:43,151 --> 01:34:43,720
Six years ago,

3662
01:34:43,720 --> 01:34:45,780
fucking signed been ass grin out dairy.

3663
01:34:45,820 --> 01:34:45,950
Oh,

3664
01:34:45,950 --> 01:34:46,661
come on Bro.

3665
01:34:46,661 --> 01:34:47,850
I'm still talking about Cole Khan.

3666
01:34:47,870 --> 01:34:48,880
Saki right now.

3667
01:34:48,881 --> 01:34:49,390
Son.

3668
01:34:49,390 --> 01:34:51,250
Go con is a fucking savage now.

3669
01:34:51,251 --> 01:34:52,520
He's a super source voids.

3670
01:34:52,660 --> 01:34:54,190
Tossum a grappler.

3671
01:34:54,310 --> 01:34:54,521
Yeah.

3672
01:34:54,521 --> 01:34:55,390
That's going to have to kick,

3673
01:34:55,400 --> 01:34:55,541
kick,

3674
01:34:55,541 --> 01:34:55,960
kick out.

3675
01:34:55,960 --> 01:34:56,141
Yeah.

3676
01:34:56,141 --> 01:34:56,810
I was going to happen.

3677
01:34:56,810 --> 01:34:57,241
Hopefully.

3678
01:34:57,241 --> 01:34:58,160
It's so weird signing.

3679
01:34:58,190 --> 01:34:59,400
Hopefully he'll have a uh,

3680
01:34:59,450 --> 01:35:02,420
a guy's willing to stand
with black for Ben.

3681
01:35:02,700 --> 01:35:03,533
Oh Shit.

3682
01:35:04,700 --> 01:35:04,911
Oh,

3683
01:35:04,911 --> 01:35:05,321
he cracked.

3684
01:35:05,321 --> 01:35:06,154
Signed the overhead.

3685
01:35:06,530 --> 01:35:08,180
But you won't sign fucking Ben Aspirin.

3686
01:35:08,360 --> 01:35:09,020
Come on.

3687
01:35:09,020 --> 01:35:12,320
Ben Asked Karen and Dana White have a
real thing debt and Ben asking and talk to

3688
01:35:12,321 --> 01:35:13,580
a bunch of shit about Dana White.

3689
01:35:13,790 --> 01:35:14,630
How many years ago?

3690
01:35:14,631 --> 01:35:15,310
Come on.

3691
01:35:15,310 --> 01:35:16,143
Trusted.

3692
01:35:16,280 --> 01:35:17,001
You're talking,

3693
01:35:17,001 --> 01:35:18,080
you're preaching to the choir.

3694
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:19,393
If it was me,

3695
01:35:19,490 --> 01:35:21,470
I would already signed him.

3696
01:35:21,471 --> 01:35:22,130
I would have them.

3697
01:35:22,130 --> 01:35:22,461
You got,

3698
01:35:22,461 --> 01:35:22,940
Dan is here.

3699
01:35:22,940 --> 01:35:23,773
He calls Dan.

3700
01:35:23,930 --> 01:35:24,890
He don't want to listen to me.

3701
01:35:25,180 --> 01:35:25,701
I look,

3702
01:35:25,701 --> 01:35:27,710
it's the same thing about me
telling you to write jokes.

3703
01:35:27,740 --> 01:35:28,420
I don't do it.

3704
01:35:28,420 --> 01:35:28,941
It's fuck you.

3705
01:35:28,941 --> 01:35:29,730
I write jokes.

3706
01:35:29,730 --> 01:35:30,490
Fuck.

3707
01:35:30,490 --> 01:35:31,980
Tell him that's my nerve.

3708
01:35:31,981 --> 01:35:32,900
Don't say that in pots.

3709
01:35:32,910 --> 01:35:33,743
A trigger.

3710
01:35:36,290 --> 01:35:37,660
A trigger.

3711
01:35:38,390 --> 01:35:39,160
Like I'll,

3712
01:35:39,160 --> 01:35:40,170
I'll have an argument now.

3713
01:35:40,171 --> 01:35:40,620
My cars,

3714
01:35:40,620 --> 01:35:41,160
I'm driving like,

3715
01:35:41,160 --> 01:35:41,980
hey fuck,

3716
01:35:41,980 --> 01:35:42,813
ah,

3717
01:35:44,120 --> 01:35:44,510
you put

3718
01:35:44,510 --> 01:35:45,980
Ben at the welterweight division.

3719
01:35:46,010 --> 01:35:48,420
He's going to wrestle his way to the
championship and they don't want,

3720
01:35:48,490 --> 01:35:49,071
I love it.

3721
01:35:49,071 --> 01:35:51,330
I want to see him versus Damien Maia Yas.

3722
01:35:51,390 --> 01:35:52,070
Oh,

3723
01:35:52,070 --> 01:35:54,320
or you don't work or you have
something to say for Ben took,

3724
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:54,891
yeah,

3725
01:35:54,891 --> 01:35:56,990
I've tried training partly
down to trading partners.

3726
01:35:57,010 --> 01:35:57,290
Yeah,

3727
01:35:57,290 --> 01:35:58,160
but that's a problem.

3728
01:35:58,370 --> 01:36:02,750
But the problem with Woodley is woolly
can put you on the fucking planet.

3729
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:04,760
Pluto was one punch.

3730
01:36:04,820 --> 01:36:05,653
He's so,

3731
01:36:06,590 --> 01:36:07,040
yeah,

3732
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:10,460
I get you a little stumbly Pluto one puck
kind of fucking stumbled through that

3733
01:36:10,461 --> 01:36:11,294
one.

3734
01:36:12,440 --> 01:36:15,080
Highly always say put you on Pluto was
trying to come up with a better word.

3735
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:17,780
Damien Maia has a very hard
time taking Woodley down.

3736
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:18,040
Well,

3737
01:36:18,040 --> 01:36:19,130
how do you think that fight goes down?

3738
01:36:19,550 --> 01:36:21,050
It's a hard fight for Damien.

3739
01:36:21,080 --> 01:36:25,850
Very hard fight because Damien Woodley
is ruthlessly powerful on his feet.

3740
01:36:26,180 --> 01:36:28,130
His fucking striking is so scary.

3741
01:36:28,250 --> 01:36:29,460
Think about what he did to Wonderboy.

3742
01:36:29,570 --> 01:36:30,440
Two fights in a row.

3743
01:36:30,470 --> 01:36:30,950
Yeah.

3744
01:36:30,950 --> 01:36:32,060
Uh,

3745
01:36:32,080 --> 01:36:32,870
two fights in a row.

3746
01:36:32,870 --> 01:36:33,530
One fight,

3747
01:36:33,530 --> 01:36:34,040
two fights.

3748
01:36:34,040 --> 01:36:36,200
That second fight was punk shit.

3749
01:36:36,230 --> 01:36:37,200
He heard them bad though.

3750
01:36:37,210 --> 01:36:38,630
Still 30 seconds in the fifth round,

3751
01:36:38,660 --> 01:36:39,950
but still he can do that.

3752
01:36:40,220 --> 01:36:41,360
He can hurt you.

3753
01:36:41,390 --> 01:36:43,580
It's always a liability
and he's hurting Wonderboy.

3754
01:36:43,670 --> 01:36:47,240
Who's one of the best strikers literally
ever in the 170 pound division.

3755
01:36:47,270 --> 01:36:47,780
True.

3756
01:36:47,780 --> 01:36:49,340
Tyron Woodley can hurt anybody.

3757
01:36:49,341 --> 01:36:50,174
He's got sucked.

3758
01:36:50,200 --> 01:36:50,681
Nobody did it.

3759
01:36:50,681 --> 01:36:51,830
Robbie Lawler one punch.

3760
01:36:52,070 --> 01:36:52,903
Paul,

3761
01:36:52,970 --> 01:36:53,601
here's the problem.

3762
01:36:53,601 --> 01:36:54,320
Here's the problem.

3763
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:55,011
Well not the prime,

3764
01:36:55,011 --> 01:36:57,410
but here's what if Damien Maia
stymied and engage in that,

3765
01:36:57,560 --> 01:36:59,360
he's going to jump to garden half guard.

3766
01:36:59,390 --> 01:37:00,950
That's where it gets tricky in a try.

3767
01:37:00,951 --> 01:37:03,120
But he's 39 years old and
he's going to try to do,

3768
01:37:04,090 --> 01:37:05,660
I don't know about way big.

3769
01:37:05,690 --> 01:37:05,811
Oh,

3770
01:37:05,811 --> 01:37:06,110
he's a,

3771
01:37:06,110 --> 01:37:07,530
he's way taller,

3772
01:37:07,550 --> 01:37:08,090
taller,

3773
01:37:08,090 --> 01:37:09,980
but Tyron is a fucking tank.

3774
01:37:10,040 --> 01:37:10,940
He's all muscle.

3775
01:37:11,170 --> 01:37:11,460
Yeah,

3776
01:37:11,460 --> 01:37:11,690
but you,

3777
01:37:11,690 --> 01:37:13,910
but you get Damien Maia
in a deep half guard.

3778
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:14,833
I don't care who you are.

3779
01:37:15,240 --> 01:37:16,073
You don't have some trouble.

3780
01:37:16,180 --> 01:37:16,371
Yeah.

3781
01:37:16,371 --> 01:37:18,620
But you're going to be
taking shots on the way in.

3782
01:37:18,680 --> 01:37:19,001
Oh No.

3783
01:37:19,001 --> 01:37:19,730
I th I think,

3784
01:37:19,730 --> 01:37:19,881
uh,

3785
01:37:19,881 --> 01:37:22,510
Woodley's the roughest matchup
for Damien Maia to get a belt.

3786
01:37:22,511 --> 01:37:23,000
But yeah,

3787
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:23,571
I think so.

3788
01:37:23,571 --> 01:37:24,030
Yeah.

3789
01:37:24,030 --> 01:37:25,310
There couldn't be a worst matchup for him,

3790
01:37:25,311 --> 01:37:26,144
but I like it.

3791
01:37:26,510 --> 01:37:27,950
I like it because it's interesting.

3792
01:37:27,951 --> 01:37:28,311
But man,

3793
01:37:28,311 --> 01:37:31,610
I wish Damien had a shot at
this like a few years ago.

3794
01:37:31,700 --> 01:37:33,180
So Bob has got some good striking,

3795
01:37:33,181 --> 01:37:34,130
he's got a great chap,

3796
01:37:34,131 --> 01:37:34,910
watch this,

3797
01:37:34,910 --> 01:37:37,760
he's doing these undercuts and all
this kind of stuff is good fighter.

3798
01:37:38,210 --> 01:37:41,390
Very good striker first
dean lister in his corner.

3799
01:37:41,720 --> 01:37:41,961
Yeah,

3800
01:37:41,961 --> 01:37:42,231
he is.

3801
01:37:42,231 --> 01:37:44,100
Definitely is dean lister and
Peter Bought Sabattus called.

3802
01:37:44,101 --> 01:37:44,390
Yep.

3803
01:37:44,390 --> 01:37:45,290
Interesting.

3804
01:37:45,590 --> 01:37:48,110
Where is he this jab as you'll see him.

3805
01:37:48,230 --> 01:37:48,521
Boom,

3806
01:37:48,521 --> 01:37:49,250
boom.

3807
01:37:49,250 --> 01:37:53,630
Pretty sure Ben has gotten a long ass
reach man and he likes to throw a lot of

3808
01:37:53,631 --> 01:37:55,010
those front kicks to the body,

3809
01:37:55,110 --> 01:37:55,351
dude.

3810
01:37:55,351 --> 01:37:56,160
How Bouts Cowboy

3811
01:37:56,160 --> 01:37:57,270
Robbie Lawler.

3812
01:37:57,630 --> 01:37:58,463
That's crazy.

3813
01:37:59,490 --> 01:38:00,323
That's crazy.

3814
01:38:02,040 --> 01:38:03,450
So I think Ben,

3815
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:06,450
I mean Ben can stand with people for sure,

3816
01:38:06,570 --> 01:38:09,840
but I think Ben's best chance is if
you can get this fight to the ground.

3817
01:38:09,860 --> 01:38:09,980
Yeah.

3818
01:38:09,980 --> 01:38:10,230
Cause he,

3819
01:38:10,230 --> 01:38:12,520
I think Ben in the clinic
was really Japanese.

3820
01:38:13,250 --> 01:38:14,520
I Love Ben in the plum.

3821
01:38:14,670 --> 01:38:14,911
Yeah,

3822
01:38:14,911 --> 01:38:15,061
no,

3823
01:38:15,061 --> 01:38:15,960
he's got a great poem.

3824
01:38:16,010 --> 01:38:16,741
He had a great plan.

3825
01:38:16,741 --> 01:38:17,250
What's these?

3826
01:38:17,250 --> 01:38:17,731
He's long.

3827
01:38:17,731 --> 01:38:19,770
They can't really get them to
do so much bigger than them.

3828
01:38:20,070 --> 01:38:20,903
What's the plum?

3829
01:38:20,940 --> 01:38:22,080
The Thai clinch.

3830
01:38:22,410 --> 01:38:23,243
Oh.

3831
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:24,300
Um,

3832
01:38:24,300 --> 01:38:24,810
uh,

3833
01:38:24,810 --> 01:38:26,400
Sabato has been lightened them up,

3834
01:38:26,401 --> 01:38:27,240
but that jab man,

3835
01:38:27,320 --> 01:38:29,600
that's a nice step in jab swift.

3836
01:38:29,610 --> 01:38:30,780
Just going underneath to,

3837
01:38:30,781 --> 01:38:34,350
he's doing an upper cuts and I think
it's hard time sometimes when south paws

3838
01:38:34,351 --> 01:38:35,580
fight other south paws too,

3839
01:38:35,581 --> 01:38:35,820
that like,

3840
01:38:35,820 --> 01:38:36,360
Ooh,

3841
01:38:36,360 --> 01:38:36,600
yeah,

3842
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:36,771
yeah.

3843
01:38:36,771 --> 01:38:37,740
It's a bit of a shit show.

3844
01:38:37,741 --> 01:38:38,340
Yeah.

3845
01:38:38,340 --> 01:38:42,420
It's guys facing looks just like he's
Ben's eyes pretty fucked up from that.

3846
01:38:42,740 --> 01:38:43,620
Keeps getting caught,

3847
01:38:43,621 --> 01:38:44,454
man.

3848
01:38:45,240 --> 01:38:46,073
Yeah.

3849
01:38:46,120 --> 01:38:46,750
Working.

3850
01:38:46,750 --> 01:38:48,220
Ben's was trying to close the distance.

3851
01:38:48,280 --> 01:38:48,910
Oh,

3852
01:38:48,910 --> 01:38:50,830
you got click that left hand.

3853
01:38:50,831 --> 01:38:51,221
It's the same.

3854
01:38:51,221 --> 01:38:52,054
They right clip

3855
01:38:54,040 --> 01:38:55,560
and it's taken a lot of punishing.

3856
01:38:55,580 --> 01:38:56,413
Smooth.

3857
01:38:56,450 --> 01:38:56,771
Okay.

3858
01:38:56,771 --> 01:39:00,490
But he's trying to get time but he's
trying to get that clinch in Sabata.

3859
01:39:00,820 --> 01:39:01,091
Okay,

3860
01:39:01,091 --> 01:39:02,620
let's see if he can do anything.

3861
01:39:02,650 --> 01:39:03,250
Okay.

3862
01:39:03,250 --> 01:39:03,491
Okay.

3863
01:39:03,491 --> 01:39:03,831
Here we go.

3864
01:39:03,831 --> 01:39:05,200
Much smarter bottle.

3865
01:39:05,250 --> 01:39:06,190
Just let them stand out.

3866
01:39:06,191 --> 01:39:09,040
A lot of fucked up wrapped up here.

3867
01:39:09,041 --> 01:39:10,110
He's got a mission control here.

3868
01:39:10,111 --> 01:39:11,700
This is what Ben needs is not good.

3869
01:39:11,701 --> 01:39:12,730
This is not good for us about it.

3870
01:39:12,731 --> 01:39:14,820
And Ben's got these crazy long ass legs.

3871
01:39:14,830 --> 01:39:15,790
Gonna get that left leg out.

3872
01:39:15,800 --> 01:39:16,020
Watch.

3873
01:39:16,020 --> 01:39:17,260
Watch him pop that left leg out.

3874
01:39:17,320 --> 01:39:18,310
He's also Staccato.

3875
01:39:18,430 --> 01:39:20,680
Sabata is trying to ease his uh,

3876
01:39:20,740 --> 01:39:22,990
his right knee forward every
time Ben moves his leg,

3877
01:39:22,991 --> 01:39:24,190
but it's going to pop up over the top.

3878
01:39:24,370 --> 01:39:26,470
Now Subodh is not in a good place.

3879
01:39:26,860 --> 01:39:27,693
This is not good.

3880
01:39:28,060 --> 01:39:31,060
He's trying to put tea in danger of
getting caught with hear submissions.

3881
01:39:31,330 --> 01:39:32,111
So first of all,

3882
01:39:32,111 --> 01:39:35,470
his left arm was completely trapped
in his right arm is on the mat,

3883
01:39:35,471 --> 01:39:36,550
which is the wrong place for it.

3884
01:39:36,551 --> 01:39:40,270
Cause his right arm should be on the
chest right now because Ben's going to put

3885
01:39:40,271 --> 01:39:41,260
him in the dead orchard,

3886
01:39:41,470 --> 01:39:44,710
which means both legs trapped in a
triangle or both arms rather trapped in a

3887
01:39:44,711 --> 01:39:45,544
triangle.

3888
01:39:45,640 --> 01:39:46,660
How much time is left though?

3889
01:39:46,710 --> 01:39:48,390
Not much pulled the clock.

3890
01:39:48,391 --> 01:39:49,690
It's probably 10 10 seconds.

3891
01:39:49,860 --> 01:39:50,360
Yeah.

3892
01:39:50,360 --> 01:39:52,030
But also remember Ben's
recovering right now.

3893
01:39:52,070 --> 01:39:54,270
It's a great move by Ben.

3894
01:39:54,610 --> 01:39:57,610
Terrible move by homeboy to let him
go to fly farm down to the ground.

3895
01:39:58,030 --> 01:39:58,361
Yeah.

3896
01:39:58,361 --> 01:39:59,440
I don't know why he did that.

3897
01:40:00,220 --> 01:40:01,630
I think he thought he can hammer them out.

3898
01:40:03,060 --> 01:40:03,893
Okay.

3899
01:40:05,130 --> 01:40:05,700
Yeah.

3900
01:40:05,700 --> 01:40:06,533
Interesting.

3901
01:40:06,990 --> 01:40:08,880
So what we were talking
about non fight related,

3902
01:40:08,881 --> 01:40:11,130
we were just talking about
something super important.

3903
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:13,673
Um,

3904
01:40:13,860 --> 01:40:14,600
hold on.

3905
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:16,050
We were talking about Tyron Woodley,

3906
01:40:16,260 --> 01:40:16,670
dangerous.

3907
01:40:16,670 --> 01:40:17,590
He was a singer.

3908
01:40:17,670 --> 01:40:19,880
Jermaine Cyborg.

3909
01:40:20,090 --> 01:40:20,790
Oh yeah.

3910
01:40:20,790 --> 01:40:21,623
Yeah.

3911
01:40:21,980 --> 01:40:23,650
I think takes a lot too much.

3912
01:40:23,651 --> 01:40:24,720
You do too much hate.

3913
01:40:24,721 --> 01:40:24,961
You know,

3914
01:40:24,961 --> 01:40:25,794
she do you,

3915
01:40:25,880 --> 01:40:26,713
I love that.

3916
01:40:26,970 --> 01:40:28,140
Change your physiology.

3917
01:40:28,380 --> 01:40:29,213
Don't you think that,

3918
01:40:29,550 --> 01:40:30,120
I mean,

3919
01:40:30,120 --> 01:40:31,500
no more than anybody else has.

3920
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:31,771
Right.

3921
01:40:31,771 --> 01:40:33,840
You're talking about
the woman has done that?

3922
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:35,190
I don't,

3923
01:40:35,190 --> 01:40:38,550
I mean if we're talking about steroid
use that she got caught with 2012,

3924
01:40:38,551 --> 01:40:40,240
I mean how many people have
been caught with a steroid?

3925
01:40:40,270 --> 01:40:42,630
I think she takes out an unfair
Bronto look at that straight.

3926
01:40:43,570 --> 01:40:44,403
Um,

3927
01:40:45,220 --> 01:40:46,053
I don't know.

3928
01:40:47,820 --> 01:40:48,601
It is what it is.

3929
01:40:48,601 --> 01:40:49,091
So let's see.

3930
01:40:49,091 --> 01:40:51,330
What do you do with
that 145 pound division?

3931
01:40:51,360 --> 01:40:52,920
You just don't give Cyborg a fight.

3932
01:40:53,680 --> 01:40:54,070
No.

3933
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:54,611
I think,

3934
01:40:54,611 --> 01:40:54,770
uh,

3935
01:40:54,770 --> 01:40:55,660
you vacate.

3936
01:40:55,900 --> 01:40:58,240
If Germain de Randamie does
not want to fight Cyborg,

3937
01:40:58,241 --> 01:40:58,780
but she said,

3938
01:40:58,780 --> 01:41:02,170
and you are allowing Cyborg to
fight and she won't fight her.

3939
01:41:02,440 --> 01:41:02,801
You,

3940
01:41:02,801 --> 01:41:03,070
uh,

3941
01:41:03,070 --> 01:41:03,461
first of all,

3942
01:41:03,461 --> 01:41:04,540
you got to give Cyborg.

3943
01:41:05,260 --> 01:41:06,580
I mean you got to give her a fight,

3944
01:41:06,581 --> 01:41:06,761
right?

3945
01:41:06,761 --> 01:41:07,870
Isn't she fighting cat?

3946
01:41:08,330 --> 01:41:10,030
But what cat and her both want it,

3947
01:41:10,031 --> 01:41:10,450
but they,

3948
01:41:10,450 --> 01:41:11,201
for whatever reason,

3949
01:41:11,201 --> 01:41:13,150
they want to announce the
fight on the Anaheim card.

3950
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:14,290
Why won't they announce it?

3951
01:41:14,350 --> 01:41:15,580
I have no idea to talk to your boy.

3952
01:41:15,730 --> 01:41:16,563
Hmm.

3953
01:41:16,780 --> 01:41:17,680
Well who knows what's going on.

3954
01:41:17,681 --> 01:41:20,470
You'd have to talk to Kat cause cat
just came out hard against Reebok.

3955
01:41:20,620 --> 01:41:20,900
Well,

3956
01:41:20,900 --> 01:41:22,420
we'll see that the,

3957
01:41:22,421 --> 01:41:23,021
I saw that.

3958
01:41:23,021 --> 01:41:23,681
But the thing is,

3959
01:41:23,681 --> 01:41:24,830
is a cat,

3960
01:41:24,840 --> 01:41:25,090
cat,

3961
01:41:25,090 --> 01:41:27,190
cat wants to fight Cyborg once the fight,

3962
01:41:27,400 --> 01:41:27,970
but something,

3963
01:41:27,970 --> 01:41:29,830
there's some seems to
be some sort of hiccup.

3964
01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:31,180
I'm not sure why know what it is.

3965
01:41:31,420 --> 01:41:32,253
But also,

3966
01:41:32,440 --> 01:41:32,721
you know,

3967
01:41:32,721 --> 01:41:32,850
with,

3968
01:41:32,850 --> 01:41:33,220
you know,

3969
01:41:33,220 --> 01:41:34,750
sideboards going on social media,

3970
01:41:34,780 --> 01:41:35,021
you know,

3971
01:41:35,021 --> 01:41:35,561
and it's good.

3972
01:41:35,561 --> 01:41:36,400
She's voice in a pinch.

3973
01:41:36,401 --> 01:41:37,234
She's unhappy,

3974
01:41:37,300 --> 01:41:38,170
but it's relentless.

3975
01:41:38,171 --> 01:41:39,130
It's every day.

3976
01:41:39,490 --> 01:41:41,860
I don't know if they
want that as their champ.

3977
01:41:41,920 --> 01:41:44,350
So you want the fight and
you won't be the champ now,

3978
01:41:44,440 --> 01:41:45,310
but the UFC is going,

3979
01:41:45,311 --> 01:41:46,070
hold up.

3980
01:41:46,070 --> 01:41:46,440
She,

3981
01:41:46,440 --> 01:41:47,140
she's already,

3982
01:41:47,140 --> 01:41:47,500
you know,

3983
01:41:47,500 --> 01:41:47,891
yelling.

3984
01:41:47,891 --> 01:41:51,370
Now what is she saying every
day she's saying gimme a fight.

3985
01:41:51,400 --> 01:41:51,911
Oh,

3986
01:41:51,911 --> 01:41:53,410
Ben Saunders with a stiff jab.

3987
01:41:53,710 --> 01:41:54,543
She's literally saying,

3988
01:41:54,850 --> 01:41:55,571
I don't understand.

3989
01:41:55,571 --> 01:41:55,991
Give me a fight.

3990
01:41:55,991 --> 01:41:57,160
Let me fight Megan Anderson,

3991
01:41:57,161 --> 01:41:57,431
who's,

3992
01:41:57,431 --> 01:41:58,120
you know,

3993
01:41:58,120 --> 01:41:58,901
champion and Victor,

3994
01:41:58,901 --> 01:41:59,651
let me fight cat.

3995
01:41:59,651 --> 01:42:00,580
Let me fight somebody.

3996
01:42:00,581 --> 01:42:01,414
Do something.

3997
01:42:01,690 --> 01:42:02,021
Well,

3998
01:42:02,021 --> 01:42:02,980
I could see her argument.

3999
01:42:03,050 --> 01:42:03,790
That makes sense.

4000
01:42:03,790 --> 01:42:04,481
She wants a fight.

4001
01:42:04,481 --> 01:42:04,811
And Megan,

4002
01:42:04,811 --> 01:42:04,951
Hannah,

4003
01:42:04,951 --> 01:42:05,771
she wants a fighter.

4004
01:42:05,771 --> 01:42:06,910
I think that's a good fight.

4005
01:42:07,300 --> 01:42:08,230
The best fight can make,

4006
01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:09,081
can just go.

4007
01:42:09,081 --> 01:42:09,914
It really doesn't make sense.

4008
01:42:10,090 --> 01:42:10,301
Well,

4009
01:42:10,301 --> 01:42:13,750
cats and gotten was a name in the UFC
and Megan and Sean doesn't have a name in

4010
01:42:13,751 --> 01:42:14,584
the UFC yet.

4011
01:42:15,220 --> 01:42:15,581
But yeah,

4012
01:42:15,581 --> 01:42:16,121
I agree with you.

4013
01:42:16,121 --> 01:42:16,841
That's a good fight.

4014
01:42:16,841 --> 01:42:18,400
And Megan Anderson's a big girl,

4015
01:42:19,690 --> 01:42:20,171
big girl,

4016
01:42:20,171 --> 01:42:21,130
and very talented,

4017
01:42:21,131 --> 01:42:21,791
very talented.

4018
01:42:21,791 --> 01:42:22,301
Great fight.

4019
01:42:22,301 --> 01:42:22,970
She's legit.

4020
01:42:22,970 --> 01:42:23,230
Hunter.

4021
01:42:23,230 --> 01:42:23,531
Oh,

4022
01:42:23,531 --> 01:42:24,364
Ben got rocked.

4023
01:42:24,850 --> 01:42:25,683
Ah.

4024
01:42:26,100 --> 01:42:27,430
Oh God.

4025
01:42:27,610 --> 01:42:28,690
Oh Jesus.

4026
01:42:28,691 --> 01:42:29,431
Tough for band,

4027
01:42:29,431 --> 01:42:29,561
man.

4028
01:42:29,561 --> 01:42:31,510
He's taken a lot of
punishment in this fight.

4029
01:42:31,511 --> 01:42:32,344
Jesus.

4030
01:42:33,130 --> 01:42:33,551
Fuck.

4031
01:42:33,551 --> 01:42:34,480
He's tough though.

4032
01:42:34,481 --> 01:42:35,314
It's tough.

4033
01:42:35,900 --> 01:42:36,490
Tough,

4034
01:42:36,490 --> 01:42:37,960
tough as shit.

4035
01:42:38,230 --> 01:42:39,011
My God,

4036
01:42:39,011 --> 01:42:39,730
he's just autos.

4037
01:42:39,730 --> 01:42:40,840
Get that crazy.

4038
01:42:41,010 --> 01:42:41,401
So bottle.

4039
01:42:41,401 --> 01:42:44,590
I can calculate that like sort of Jab,

4040
01:42:44,730 --> 01:42:44,980
Jab,

4041
01:42:44,980 --> 01:42:46,070
jab to amazing.

4042
01:42:46,510 --> 01:42:48,040
It's been very smart and calculated.

4043
01:42:48,100 --> 01:42:48,791
Not Rushing,

4044
01:42:48,791 --> 01:42:49,810
taking punishment here.

4045
01:42:49,811 --> 01:42:51,010
There was busted up,

4046
01:42:51,011 --> 01:42:51,251
man.

4047
01:42:51,251 --> 01:42:52,084
He's busted up.

4048
01:42:53,290 --> 01:42:58,270
What a tough fucking taking
punishment keeps coming.

4049
01:42:58,271 --> 01:42:58,840
He's trying,

4050
01:42:58,840 --> 01:43:00,310
he's trying to go with them to men.

4051
01:43:00,670 --> 01:43:03,270
That Anaheim card has
John in DC though too.

4052
01:43:03,310 --> 01:43:04,780
You can't wait for that.

4053
01:43:04,810 --> 01:43:05,643
Well,

4054
01:43:05,860 --> 01:43:08,480
and I think there's another
big fight on that card too,

4055
01:43:08,481 --> 01:43:08,691
right?

4056
01:43:08,691 --> 01:43:09,280
There's this,

4057
01:43:09,280 --> 01:43:10,113
who is it?

4058
01:43:10,630 --> 01:43:12,060
It just got announced in it.

4059
01:43:12,061 --> 01:43:12,611
Young Jamie.

4060
01:43:12,611 --> 01:43:13,061
What does that,

4061
01:43:13,061 --> 01:43:13,480
uh,

4062
01:43:13,480 --> 01:43:13,870
what's,

4063
01:43:13,870 --> 01:43:16,510
what's the current state
of the Anaheim quiz show?

4064
01:43:16,511 --> 01:43:16,661
No,

4065
01:43:16,661 --> 01:43:19,380
I don't do cyber cat cyborg verse that.

4066
01:43:19,540 --> 01:43:19,880
Uh,

4067
01:43:19,880 --> 01:43:20,713
Megan Anderson.

4068
01:43:20,920 --> 01:43:22,480
Oh my God.

4069
01:43:22,481 --> 01:43:23,231
They should stop.

4070
01:43:23,231 --> 01:43:23,561
Stop,

4071
01:43:23,561 --> 01:43:23,831
stop.

4072
01:43:23,831 --> 01:43:24,321
Please stop.

4073
01:43:24,321 --> 01:43:24,671
Please stop.

4074
01:43:24,671 --> 01:43:24,911
Please.

4075
01:43:24,911 --> 01:43:25,744
Please stop.

4076
01:43:25,990 --> 01:43:26,620
Stop.

4077
01:43:26,620 --> 01:43:26,950
Stop.

4078
01:43:26,950 --> 01:43:27,191
Stop.

4079
01:43:27,191 --> 01:43:27,401
Stop.

4080
01:43:27,401 --> 01:43:27,641
Stop.

4081
01:43:27,641 --> 01:43:27,980
Stop.

4082
01:43:27,980 --> 01:43:28,350
That's it.

4083
01:43:28,350 --> 01:43:29,440
That's good.

4084
01:43:29,441 --> 01:43:29,771
Stop.

4085
01:43:29,771 --> 01:43:30,131
It's good.

4086
01:43:30,131 --> 01:43:30,301
Stop.

4087
01:43:30,301 --> 01:43:31,870
It should stop as a terrible fight

4088
01:43:33,690 --> 01:43:35,040
with Peter.

4089
01:43:35,110 --> 01:43:35,943
So Botha.

4090
01:43:35,950 --> 01:43:36,783
Hey Man.

4091
01:43:37,210 --> 01:43:37,961
He's a tough guy,

4092
01:43:37,961 --> 01:43:39,550
but that's a legit stoppage.

4093
01:43:39,900 --> 01:43:40,650
He got hurt.

4094
01:43:40,650 --> 01:43:41,483
That's fair.

4095
01:43:41,830 --> 01:43:43,060
He was taking a lot of management.

4096
01:43:43,180 --> 01:43:44,410
Piercer bottle look good.

4097
01:43:44,440 --> 01:43:46,150
You'll see two at 14 okay.

4098
01:43:46,240 --> 01:43:47,620
Daniel Cormier and Jon Jones.

4099
01:43:47,621 --> 01:43:48,520
What else do we got here?

4100
01:43:49,270 --> 01:43:49,451
Oh,

4101
01:43:49,451 --> 01:43:50,290
this isn't the main,

4102
01:43:50,440 --> 01:43:50,990
I mean,

4103
01:43:50,990 --> 01:43:52,340
this is just Suzanne so far.

4104
01:43:53,830 --> 01:43:54,200
Oh,

4105
01:43:54,200 --> 01:43:54,451
do,

4106
01:43:54,451 --> 01:43:56,180
oh Troy and Andrew feely.

4107
01:43:56,270 --> 01:43:56,610
Touchy.

4108
01:43:56,610 --> 01:43:57,890
Sterling Sterling.

4109
01:43:58,290 --> 01:43:59,300
Hennen brow.

4110
01:43:59,420 --> 01:44:00,560
That's a fun one.

4111
01:44:00,620 --> 01:44:00,831
I mean,

4112
01:44:00,831 --> 01:44:02,360
these aren't any needle movers,

4113
01:44:02,361 --> 01:44:03,194
but that boy,

4114
01:44:03,350 --> 01:44:04,820
there's still going to fill the cart up.

4115
01:44:04,900 --> 01:44:05,091
Oh,

4116
01:44:05,091 --> 01:44:06,190
it's out Jared borough.

4117
01:44:06,260 --> 01:44:09,140
That's a big step up
for aljamain sterling.

4118
01:44:09,141 --> 01:44:10,500
Huge step on them.

4119
01:44:10,520 --> 01:44:12,710
They're banking on and kind
of being over the hill.

4120
01:44:12,711 --> 01:44:17,450
I think he fed them route 15
he's ranked number 15 is he?

4121
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:18,381
God Damn,

4122
01:44:18,381 --> 01:44:20,330
he's lost his last featherweight.

4123
01:44:20,420 --> 01:44:20,901
How old is he?

4124
01:44:20,901 --> 01:44:21,950
It's featherweight now,

4125
01:44:21,980 --> 01:44:22,340
right?

4126
01:44:22,340 --> 01:44:23,780
Remember we bought 35,

4127
01:44:24,380 --> 01:44:25,640
but still 15.

4128
01:44:26,300 --> 01:44:27,230
Fuck son.

4129
01:44:28,370 --> 01:44:29,121
Did you hear that?

4130
01:44:29,121 --> 01:44:29,954
Uh,

4131
01:44:30,470 --> 01:44:31,100
uh,

4132
01:44:31,100 --> 01:44:31,791
what's her face?

4133
01:44:31,791 --> 01:44:32,624
Um,

4134
01:44:32,870 --> 01:44:33,920
tested positive.

4135
01:44:33,980 --> 01:44:34,910
What the fuck's her name?

4136
01:44:34,940 --> 01:44:35,700
Um,

4137
01:44:35,700 --> 01:44:35,900
uh,

4138
01:44:35,900 --> 01:44:36,733
in Dallas.

4139
01:44:36,860 --> 01:44:37,310
Yeah.

4140
01:44:37,310 --> 01:44:37,551
Yeah,

4141
01:44:37,551 --> 01:44:39,540
I saw that it was test Usada.

4142
01:44:39,830 --> 01:44:40,281
Yeah,

4143
01:44:40,281 --> 01:44:40,940
she uh,

4144
01:44:40,940 --> 01:44:44,860
she had a elevated epitestosterone ratio.

4145
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:45,713
Who is this?

4146
01:44:46,050 --> 01:44:46,883
What the fuck?

4147
01:44:49,730 --> 01:44:50,563
What

4148
01:44:52,400 --> 01:44:52,971
the Hell's her name?

4149
01:44:52,971 --> 01:44:53,804
Jeremy.

4150
01:44:53,830 --> 01:44:54,410
Yeah,

4151
01:44:54,410 --> 01:44:57,680
but under Usada rules she
wouldn't have tested positive.

4152
01:44:57,681 --> 01:44:59,180
So tons of the Dallas Commission.

4153
01:44:59,390 --> 01:45:00,223
Casey.

4154
01:45:01,240 --> 01:45:01,850
Yeah.

4155
01:45:01,850 --> 01:45:02,683
Cortney Casey.

4156
01:45:02,990 --> 01:45:03,500
Casey.

4157
01:45:03,500 --> 01:45:04,190
There you go.

4158
01:45:04,190 --> 01:45:05,023
That's what it is.

4159
01:45:05,120 --> 01:45:06,410
That's what sucks is she,

4160
01:45:06,530 --> 01:45:06,930
you know her,

4161
01:45:06,930 --> 01:45:08,180
her when is overturned?

4162
01:45:08,181 --> 01:45:08,631
She's fine.

4163
01:45:08,631 --> 01:45:09,464
5,000,

4164
01:45:09,530 --> 01:45:09,891
but under,

4165
01:45:09,891 --> 01:45:10,970
you sought a rules.

4166
01:45:11,030 --> 01:45:13,560
She'd pass the test burner.

4167
01:45:13,610 --> 01:45:15,680
Dallas Commission like
NASA and not up in here.

4168
01:45:15,980 --> 01:45:16,781
Under you side.

4169
01:45:16,781 --> 01:45:17,151
A rural,

4170
01:45:17,151 --> 01:45:18,080
she passed the test.

4171
01:45:18,590 --> 01:45:19,400
How's that work?

4172
01:45:19,400 --> 01:45:20,330
I have no idea.

4173
01:45:20,390 --> 01:45:24,380
But she has an elevated
epitestosterone to testosterone ratio,

4174
01:45:24,381 --> 01:45:24,860
right?

4175
01:45:24,860 --> 01:45:25,161
Yeah.

4176
01:45:25,161 --> 01:45:26,450
Before Dallas though.

4177
01:45:26,750 --> 01:45:29,060
But under Usada regulation she did it.

4178
01:45:29,390 --> 01:45:30,081
That's weird.

4179
01:45:30,081 --> 01:45:31,910
But Dallas commissions
when who overturned it?

4180
01:45:31,911 --> 01:45:33,470
Cause that's the
commission and that weird.

4181
01:45:33,980 --> 01:45:34,281
Well,

4182
01:45:34,281 --> 01:45:35,270
I mean it makes you think like,

4183
01:45:35,271 --> 01:45:40,100
why doesn't you sought to have
more stringent testing than doubt?

4184
01:45:40,101 --> 01:45:43,730
I don't understand why they have different
standards like Olympics one to one I

4185
01:45:43,731 --> 01:45:44,060
think,

4186
01:45:44,060 --> 01:45:45,020
or two to one.

4187
01:45:45,070 --> 01:45:49,570
Some are four to 101 case he picked
up the biggest wham blah blah blah.

4188
01:45:49,590 --> 01:45:54,200
You S Usada the official antidoping
agency has yet to announce if they will be

4189
01:45:54,201 --> 01:45:55,250
taking any action.

4190
01:45:55,640 --> 01:45:55,881
Oh,

4191
01:45:55,881 --> 01:45:59,030
so Dallas is only suspended
her for a short amount of time.

4192
01:45:59,031 --> 01:46:01,160
Now the only suspend her for 90 days.

4193
01:46:01,300 --> 01:46:05,060
We have not been informed by you
side of anything regarding potential

4194
01:46:05,061 --> 01:46:07,610
anti-doping policy
violation for Cortney Casey,

4195
01:46:08,090 --> 01:46:09,020
no positive tests,

4196
01:46:09,021 --> 01:46:13,460
no suspicion of anything now or in the
past who saw it as not been in contact

4197
01:46:13,461 --> 01:46:14,294
about anything.

4198
01:46:14,360 --> 01:46:17,060
So scroll up to the top of this article.

4199
01:46:17,330 --> 01:46:18,740
So what happened here then?

4200
01:46:21,110 --> 01:46:22,490
Suspended for three months.

4201
01:46:22,550 --> 01:46:26,870
See that's what's weird because suspending
her for three months through Dallas,

4202
01:46:26,900 --> 01:46:27,230
if,

4203
01:46:27,230 --> 01:46:31,180
if you get suspended through
Usada it's two years.

4204
01:46:31,280 --> 01:46:32,030
Yeah,

4205
01:46:32,030 --> 01:46:32,420
right.

4206
01:46:32,420 --> 01:46:33,290
Isn't it two years?

4207
01:46:33,470 --> 01:46:35,450
But I mean most of the
commissions they listened,

4208
01:46:35,451 --> 01:46:36,920
they all follow the same rules,

4209
01:46:36,921 --> 01:46:38,750
but she's just suspended in Dallas.

4210
01:46:39,030 --> 01:46:39,790
Yeah.

4211
01:46:39,790 --> 01:46:40,623
Joe Daddy.

4212
01:46:41,120 --> 01:46:41,953
But yeah.

4213
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:43,393
Interesting.

4214
01:46:43,430 --> 01:46:44,263
It's weird.

4215
01:46:44,480 --> 01:46:44,660
The,

4216
01:46:44,660 --> 01:46:45,111
all the,

4217
01:46:45,111 --> 01:46:45,790
all the,

4218
01:46:45,790 --> 01:46:45,891
the,

4219
01:46:45,891 --> 01:46:46,100
you know,

4220
01:46:46,100 --> 01:46:46,791
four to one.

4221
01:46:46,791 --> 01:46:49,560
What I think Olympics two to
one just depends on commission.

4222
01:46:49,830 --> 01:46:53,010
But with you Sadik cause you saw
it as an employee of the UFC.

4223
01:46:53,011 --> 01:46:56,810
Remember you saw it as an
outsource sub contracted employee.

4224
01:46:56,830 --> 01:46:57,470
The UFC.

4225
01:46:57,470 --> 01:46:57,630
Yeah.

4226
01:46:57,630 --> 01:46:59,280
But how does you saw to not catch it?

4227
01:46:59,281 --> 01:47:00,300
That's what I don't understand.

4228
01:47:00,570 --> 01:47:00,961
I don't,

4229
01:47:00,961 --> 01:47:02,460
they test the samples as well.

4230
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:04,020
Wasn't it random?

4231
01:47:04,170 --> 01:47:05,010
They don't test everyone,

4232
01:47:05,011 --> 01:47:05,640
do they?

4233
01:47:05,640 --> 01:47:06,330
I don't know.

4234
01:47:06,330 --> 01:47:06,790
I don't,

4235
01:47:06,790 --> 01:47:08,750
I don't think they don't test
every fighter on the card.

4236
01:47:08,760 --> 01:47:09,180
I I,

4237
01:47:09,180 --> 01:47:10,230
but Dallas does.

4238
01:47:10,890 --> 01:47:11,970
Dallas did random.

4239
01:47:11,971 --> 01:47:13,440
She was one of the random ones.

4240
01:47:14,940 --> 01:47:18,420
Now what causes someone to have
an elevated epitestosterone range?

4241
01:47:18,421 --> 01:47:19,920
Like there's a bunch.

4242
01:47:20,070 --> 01:47:21,120
There's a bunch of wasted.

4243
01:47:21,320 --> 01:47:21,580
Yeah.

4244
01:47:21,580 --> 01:47:22,081
Trip those.

4245
01:47:22,081 --> 01:47:22,380
Yeah.

4246
01:47:22,380 --> 01:47:25,860
But a lot of it is like taking
some sort of external testosterone.

4247
01:47:25,890 --> 01:47:26,330
It'd be,

4248
01:47:26,330 --> 01:47:27,163
yeah.

4249
01:47:27,920 --> 01:47:31,260
Peter Soboba TKL fight
too and looking good.

4250
01:47:31,800 --> 01:47:32,820
Look at that world jacket.

4251
01:47:33,060 --> 01:47:34,290
Look at that handsome bastards.

4252
01:47:34,291 --> 01:47:34,801
You better come.

4253
01:47:34,801 --> 01:47:35,400
Correct.

4254
01:47:35,400 --> 01:47:35,911
In England,

4255
01:47:35,911 --> 01:47:36,744
man.

4256
01:47:36,920 --> 01:47:37,810
There's a handsome did.

4257
01:47:37,980 --> 01:47:39,180
He's very good looking man.

4258
01:47:39,780 --> 01:47:40,620
He's got a pocket square.

4259
01:47:40,890 --> 01:47:41,610
Of course he does it right.

4260
01:47:41,610 --> 01:47:41,911
Yes,

4261
01:47:41,911 --> 01:47:42,390
there it is.

4262
01:47:42,390 --> 01:47:43,223
Can I reach you style.

4263
01:47:43,260 --> 01:47:43,381
Oh,

4264
01:47:43,381 --> 01:47:46,500
this powerful dean lister thicker.

4265
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:48,450
Thicker than a musketeer.

4266
01:47:48,480 --> 01:47:51,060
He is so thick and he
rolls a jock all the time.

4267
01:47:51,090 --> 01:47:52,200
They're a training partner.

4268
01:47:52,230 --> 01:47:52,700
Oh really?

4269
01:47:52,700 --> 01:47:53,520
Yeah.

4270
01:47:53,520 --> 01:47:55,200
Well couns out of the room
was talk shit about them.

4271
01:47:55,380 --> 01:47:55,891
Hey guys,

4272
01:47:55,891 --> 01:47:56,260
come on.

4273
01:47:56,260 --> 01:47:57,093
Seriously.

4274
01:47:59,170 --> 01:48:00,660
So about that joke writing.

4275
01:48:06,550 --> 01:48:08,140
He's such a care.

4276
01:48:08,150 --> 01:48:09,270
That's a trigger for him.

4277
01:48:09,450 --> 01:48:10,140
It's fine.

4278
01:48:10,140 --> 01:48:11,100
I voided can.

4279
01:48:11,101 --> 01:48:11,934
I don't want to do,

4280
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:12,601
can't help it.

4281
01:48:12,601 --> 01:48:13,490
It's like I wanted to poke.

4282
01:48:13,500 --> 01:48:14,370
It's a soft spot.

4283
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:16,680
It's the only soft spot
you'll see him right there.

4284
01:48:16,681 --> 01:48:17,514
I just want to go,

4285
01:48:18,180 --> 01:48:19,070
I avoid it.

4286
01:48:19,500 --> 01:48:21,930
And then to overcome state for it for
the next week and talk about how much

4287
01:48:21,931 --> 01:48:22,710
riding he's doing.

4288
01:48:22,710 --> 01:48:22,921
I'm like,

4289
01:48:22,921 --> 01:48:23,910
do I never say you did it?

4290
01:48:23,940 --> 01:48:24,930
You don't tell Joe this.

4291
01:48:24,931 --> 01:48:26,440
Not me talking about his boxing.

4292
01:48:26,620 --> 01:48:26,971
What's right.

4293
01:48:26,971 --> 01:48:28,500
It's doing sparring.

4294
01:48:28,830 --> 01:48:30,180
Dub David also tough guy.

4295
01:48:30,330 --> 01:48:30,810
Okay.

4296
01:48:30,810 --> 01:48:31,770
I know we're just talking shit.

4297
01:48:31,771 --> 01:48:33,120
But Doug Davidoff can fight.

4298
01:48:33,860 --> 01:48:35,650
He can fight and he's
a good friend of mine.

4299
01:48:35,651 --> 01:48:36,660
She's like John Joseph.

4300
01:48:37,080 --> 01:48:37,920
Joseph tight,

4301
01:48:38,070 --> 01:48:38,491
we're tight.

4302
01:48:38,491 --> 01:48:39,960
That's a good looking shack.

4303
01:48:40,030 --> 01:48:42,840
Tan Hardee's wearing what's
up with that third button?

4304
01:48:42,890 --> 01:48:43,800
The English have to come.

4305
01:48:43,801 --> 01:48:44,281
Correct,

4306
01:48:44,281 --> 01:48:45,114
man.

4307
01:48:45,960 --> 01:48:48,720
I love when your boy Guy Ritchie
broke it down on the seat.

4308
01:48:48,780 --> 01:48:49,230
I said,

4309
01:48:49,230 --> 01:48:51,450
fucking educate this man guy,

4310
01:48:51,451 --> 01:48:52,620
which he's a bad motherfucker.

4311
01:48:52,650 --> 01:48:53,021
He really,

4312
01:48:53,021 --> 01:48:53,940
is he a black belt?

4313
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:54,440
Yeah.

4314
01:48:54,440 --> 01:48:54,970
Yeah.

4315
01:48:54,970 --> 01:48:56,610
He's a hands off for awhile.

4316
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,190
Henzel Gracie doesn't give
out any bullshit black belts.

4317
01:48:59,250 --> 01:49:02,310
It broke my heart is here and that
and then hearing his movie bombed.

4318
01:49:02,760 --> 01:49:03,330
Did it bomb?

4319
01:49:03,330 --> 01:49:04,163
Yeah,

4320
01:49:04,790 --> 01:49:05,730
a little bit.

4321
01:49:06,450 --> 01:49:07,261
Did you watch it?

4322
01:49:07,261 --> 01:49:07,621
You didn't see?

4323
01:49:07,621 --> 01:49:07,771
No,

4324
01:49:07,771 --> 01:49:08,460
I didn't see it.

4325
01:49:08,460 --> 01:49:10,500
I'm just saying that's
what the box office,

4326
01:49:11,160 --> 01:49:11,911
I don't know if it sucks.

4327
01:49:11,911 --> 01:49:13,500
I just know it didn't do
well at the box office,

4328
01:49:13,501 --> 01:49:16,230
which doesn't mean it bombed
as far as money making.

4329
01:49:16,500 --> 01:49:17,880
It's a tough sell man.

4330
01:49:17,910 --> 01:49:18,061
Oh,

4331
01:49:18,061 --> 01:49:18,420
movies,

4332
01:49:18,420 --> 01:49:20,730
King Arthur movie with a modern twist to,

4333
01:49:20,850 --> 01:49:21,520
yeah,

4334
01:49:21,520 --> 01:49:22,980
like I know,

4335
01:49:23,380 --> 01:49:24,230
but if anyone I,

4336
01:49:24,240 --> 01:49:24,780
you know,

4337
01:49:24,780 --> 01:49:28,410
I feel like they didn't know that Guy
Ritchie was that big of a part of it.

4338
01:49:28,411 --> 01:49:30,480
I feel like that would have sold it
more cause then once I found out he was

4339
01:49:30,481 --> 01:49:30,751
doing it,

4340
01:49:30,751 --> 01:49:30,961
I was like,

4341
01:49:30,961 --> 01:49:31,051
Oh,

4342
01:49:31,051 --> 01:49:31,621
I'm definitely an,

4343
01:49:31,621 --> 01:49:35,190
now they're talking about Jimmy man
and fighting a boxing match with David.

4344
01:49:35,191 --> 01:49:36,024
Hey,

4345
01:49:36,180 --> 01:49:38,490
he's trying to organize
some sort of a boxing match.

4346
01:49:39,690 --> 01:49:40,320
I don't get it.

4347
01:49:40,320 --> 01:49:41,153
Yeah.

4348
01:49:41,880 --> 01:49:45,930
Well I would like to see because manawat
he's such a fucking Badass striker.

4349
01:49:46,200 --> 01:49:48,130
If he wants to be that bad ass tracker,

4350
01:49:48,310 --> 01:49:52,660
please welcome go Ka Saki.

4351
01:49:53,470 --> 01:49:54,510
That's a fight.

4352
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:55,690
The fight she'd be,

4353
01:49:55,700 --> 01:49:58,130
man was going to show up
with a fucking single in on

4354
01:49:59,980 --> 01:50:00,820
six wrestling.

4355
01:50:00,860 --> 01:50:04,540
She's fucking the fucking
air covers on why?

4356
01:50:04,541 --> 01:50:06,520
Because your fingers
Tazy wants to wrestle on.

4357
01:50:06,650 --> 01:50:07,510
It doesn't have to be down.

4358
01:50:07,900 --> 01:50:10,660
Three point stance on a
strike with a Turkish Tyson.

4359
01:50:10,840 --> 01:50:12,170
Have you ever seen work outside?

4360
01:50:12,280 --> 01:50:17,280
I never seen him pull up a
go con highlight reel and
powerful dad gut prepare to

4361
01:50:18,401 --> 01:50:21,070
watch a mother fucker knock
people into another dementia.

4362
01:50:21,071 --> 01:50:21,790
We do that.

4363
01:50:21,790 --> 01:50:22,623
I want to ask you,

4364
01:50:23,110 --> 01:50:25,240
the UFC just signed them
be lightening hands.

4365
01:50:25,270 --> 01:50:25,720
I want to see it.

4366
01:50:25,720 --> 01:50:26,710
I want to ask you really quickly.

4367
01:50:26,920 --> 01:50:30,370
If I put moose meat and elk
and you had an a on a plate,

4368
01:50:30,371 --> 01:50:31,204
could you tell the difference?

4369
01:50:31,250 --> 01:50:32,530
It depends on how it's prepared.

4370
01:50:32,560 --> 01:50:33,520
They're very similar.

4371
01:50:33,910 --> 01:50:35,860
Outlook has a little
bit more flavor to it.

4372
01:50:37,420 --> 01:50:38,111
See if you can get,

4373
01:50:38,111 --> 01:50:39,240
is this a highlight reel?

4374
01:50:40,650 --> 01:50:41,471
It's a highlight reel.

4375
01:50:41,471 --> 01:50:44,670
His fucking hand combinations
are ruthless and my God.

4376
01:50:44,710 --> 01:50:45,341
Oh Dude,

4377
01:50:45,341 --> 01:50:46,174
you don't even know him.

4378
01:50:46,600 --> 01:50:48,350
He's one of the best
kick boxers of all time.

4379
01:50:50,770 --> 01:50:51,041
Well,

4380
01:50:51,041 --> 01:50:52,420
Tyrone Spong has a broken leg.

4381
01:50:52,530 --> 01:50:52,990
Oh my God.

4382
01:50:52,990 --> 01:50:54,430
Look at it from Saki.

4383
01:50:55,870 --> 01:50:56,703
Oh Dude.

4384
01:50:56,920 --> 01:50:57,701
Come on son.

4385
01:50:57,701 --> 01:50:59,680
Go Con Saki light motherfuckers though.

4386
01:51:00,090 --> 01:51:00,923
Oh No,

4387
01:51:01,470 --> 01:51:03,160
but that love to know,

4388
01:51:03,220 --> 01:51:03,431
Dude.

4389
01:51:03,431 --> 01:51:08,431
He has an educated lefthand look to his
body's nothing to write home about the

4390
01:51:08,700 --> 01:51:09,533
show.

4391
01:51:09,670 --> 01:51:10,870
Just a stocky fella.

4392
01:51:10,871 --> 01:51:11,590
Savage.

4393
01:51:11,590 --> 01:51:14,440
He's a fucking straight that's over him,

4394
01:51:14,441 --> 01:51:15,274
son.

4395
01:51:15,610 --> 01:51:16,271
We'll kick.

4396
01:51:16,271 --> 01:51:18,130
What the fuck that was over.

4397
01:51:18,131 --> 01:51:18,964
And by the way,

4398
01:51:19,060 --> 01:51:19,900
how much does he weigh?

4399
01:51:19,901 --> 01:51:20,734
How big is he?

4400
01:51:20,740 --> 01:51:23,610
He's a for two oh five or he's going
to fight two oh five that's him against

4401
01:51:23,611 --> 01:51:24,190
[inaudible].

4402
01:51:24,190 --> 01:51:28,400
He fought Spong and checked his leg and
spawns leg snapped in half like Anderson

4403
01:51:28,400 --> 01:51:29,440
Silva was Jesus Christ.

4404
01:51:29,480 --> 01:51:30,520
How is his,

4405
01:51:30,521 --> 01:51:30,760
uh,

4406
01:51:30,760 --> 01:51:31,900
tell him to get that mask off?

4407
01:51:31,901 --> 01:51:33,460
That shit doesn't work
because they're bad for you.

4408
01:51:33,690 --> 01:51:34,780
And that's how these people,

4409
01:51:34,781 --> 01:51:38,130
you know what these people
believe in those fucking masks.

4410
01:51:38,130 --> 01:51:40,090
Mad silly how,

4411
01:51:40,091 --> 01:51:40,810
um,

4412
01:51:40,810 --> 01:51:40,991
his,

4413
01:51:40,991 --> 01:51:41,840
his wrestling go.

4414
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:42,530
Saki.

4415
01:51:42,530 --> 01:51:43,330
No idea.

4416
01:51:43,330 --> 01:51:44,070
Terrible.

4417
01:51:44,070 --> 01:51:44,903
Awful

4418
01:51:47,100 --> 01:51:48,610
is kickboxing is off.

4419
01:51:48,611 --> 01:51:50,770
The record is an MMA.

4420
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:51,160
Oh,

4421
01:51:51,160 --> 01:51:52,070
his hair.

4422
01:51:52,120 --> 01:51:52,960
And he got submitted.

4423
01:51:53,050 --> 01:51:53,171
Oh,

4424
01:51:53,171 --> 01:51:53,620
look at this.

4425
01:51:53,620 --> 01:51:54,040
Ooh,

4426
01:51:54,040 --> 01:51:58,050
there's sun came correct
though with the fashion

4427
01:52:01,150 --> 01:52:01,983
human rooster.

4428
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:03,430
The human rooster goes down.

4429
01:52:03,730 --> 01:52:05,740
That left hand has come off the charts.

4430
01:52:05,770 --> 01:52:05,901
Oh,

4431
01:52:05,901 --> 01:52:07,390
look at him just kicking like this.

4432
01:52:07,500 --> 01:52:09,280
Imagine those with four ounce gloves.

4433
01:52:09,730 --> 01:52:10,840
Wash this combination,

4434
01:52:10,841 --> 01:52:11,674
man.

4435
01:52:11,980 --> 01:52:12,430
Hey,

4436
01:52:12,430 --> 01:52:13,110
look at this.

4437
01:52:13,110 --> 01:52:13,300
He's,

4438
01:52:13,300 --> 01:52:14,200
come on son.

4439
01:52:14,510 --> 01:52:15,343
He's going to get taken down.

4440
01:52:15,700 --> 01:52:16,410
Look at this.

4441
01:52:16,410 --> 01:52:17,560
They're not going to give them wrestlers.

4442
01:52:17,561 --> 01:52:18,490
Be Dude,

4443
01:52:18,520 --> 01:52:20,470
look at this fucking common nation.

4444
01:52:21,300 --> 01:52:22,140
They're going to make an exception.

4445
01:52:22,141 --> 01:52:23,260
And this is Daniel Geeta.

4446
01:52:23,261 --> 01:52:26,950
He's fighting title my best
heavyweights in the fight.

4447
01:52:27,340 --> 01:52:28,450
This dude with a blonde.

4448
01:52:29,110 --> 01:52:29,290
Well,

4449
01:52:29,290 --> 01:52:29,771
how do you stay?

4450
01:52:29,771 --> 01:52:30,491
How do you strike with them?

4451
01:52:30,491 --> 01:52:31,510
Then if you're UFC guy,

4452
01:52:31,511 --> 01:52:32,141
that's ridiculous.

4453
01:52:32,141 --> 01:52:32,680
I don't know.

4454
01:52:32,680 --> 01:52:34,540
You got to find out
whether or not you can.

4455
01:52:35,170 --> 01:52:36,100
It's a different game.

4456
01:52:36,190 --> 01:52:37,180
I'll tell you this right now.

4457
01:52:37,181 --> 01:52:38,500
I don't want to be Jimmy Manawat.

4458
01:52:39,130 --> 01:52:39,760
These curls.

4459
01:52:39,760 --> 01:52:40,001
Well,

4460
01:52:40,001 --> 01:52:41,380
who knows if they're
going to give him Jenny.

4461
01:52:41,381 --> 01:52:41,671
Man,

4462
01:52:41,671 --> 01:52:41,860
he works.

4463
01:52:41,860 --> 01:52:45,920
The Jimi Manuwa is like top three in the
world right now at heavyweight though.

4464
01:52:45,921 --> 01:52:46,754
It's fucking,

4465
01:52:46,880 --> 01:52:47,840
we need something.

4466
01:52:48,020 --> 01:52:48,561
That's how we,

4467
01:52:48,561 --> 01:52:48,801
okay,

4468
01:52:48,801 --> 01:52:51,020
well I just feel like someone,

4469
01:52:51,380 --> 01:52:54,620
they're going to have put him in there
with someone that's a good fighter,

4470
01:52:54,830 --> 01:52:56,450
but this is just striking.

4471
01:52:56,451 --> 01:52:58,220
This is a big test though.

4472
01:52:58,460 --> 01:53:00,500
I mean to have him come into the UFC,

4473
01:53:00,501 --> 01:53:01,550
it's a big signing.

4474
01:53:01,670 --> 01:53:03,830
It's a big deal for a guy like me.

4475
01:53:03,980 --> 01:53:05,840
I mean my Dick is hard
as a rock right now.

4476
01:53:05,870 --> 01:53:07,100
I'm very excited about this.

4477
01:53:07,101 --> 01:53:09,350
I promise you God.

4478
01:53:09,351 --> 01:53:10,070
That's some,

4479
01:53:10,070 --> 01:53:11,720
I feel like that's a Bella Torah move.

4480
01:53:11,750 --> 01:53:11,901
Like,

4481
01:53:11,901 --> 01:53:12,061
yeah,

4482
01:53:12,061 --> 01:53:13,610
it does suck out of here.

4483
01:53:14,310 --> 01:53:17,300
He get his hands now.

4484
01:53:17,301 --> 01:53:17,840
Okay,

4485
01:53:17,840 --> 01:53:19,220
he's going to put hands on people.

4486
01:53:19,250 --> 01:53:19,401
No,

4487
01:53:19,401 --> 01:53:20,090
he's not.

4488
01:53:20,090 --> 01:53:20,311
Oh,

4489
01:53:20,311 --> 01:53:23,390
I'll take a high school wrestler and
he's going to mop on the fucking floor.

4490
01:53:23,420 --> 01:53:25,160
Give them a high school wrestler,

4491
01:53:25,580 --> 01:53:26,413
give him money.

4492
01:53:27,530 --> 01:53:31,180
I want to give him somebody who lost a
bet who has to go in there and stare and

4493
01:53:31,250 --> 01:53:33,260
it has a little bit of
grudge and the UFC is like,

4494
01:53:33,261 --> 01:53:36,470
you're going to have to do this
one for someone who's just like,

4495
01:53:36,640 --> 01:53:37,100
ah,

4496
01:53:37,100 --> 01:53:38,240
questionable judgment.

4497
01:53:38,780 --> 01:53:40,820
Someone who makes a lot of
mistakes in their lives,

4498
01:53:40,821 --> 01:53:43,400
they're a good striker strike.

4499
01:53:43,430 --> 01:53:45,650
Here's his Wilcon terrifying.

4500
01:53:45,830 --> 01:53:45,981
Well,

4501
01:53:45,981 --> 01:53:48,200
someone wants approval one
own welcoming them to the,

4502
01:53:48,201 --> 01:53:48,840
you have shoot,

4503
01:53:48,840 --> 01:53:50,030
show him what a real striker.

4504
01:53:50,190 --> 01:53:52,310
But it might be the Meinhof
phenomenon too though.

4505
01:53:52,480 --> 01:53:52,970
Like,

4506
01:53:52,970 --> 01:53:53,350
uh,

4507
01:53:53,350 --> 01:53:53,901
what's his name?

4508
01:53:53,901 --> 01:53:55,210
Melvin mine off man.

4509
01:53:55,610 --> 01:53:58,260
It was just like some sort
of a scientific principles.

4510
01:53:58,550 --> 01:53:59,000
Mine.

4511
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:00,080
Sorry about the wind huff,

4512
01:54:00,090 --> 01:54:01,850
but he was so scary and devastating.

4513
01:54:01,860 --> 01:54:02,120
Man.

4514
01:54:02,120 --> 01:54:03,440
You're talking 10 years ago.

4515
01:54:03,441 --> 01:54:04,730
I'm saying though he didn't,

4516
01:54:05,100 --> 01:54:07,880
after the law I thing
Melvin Melvin was a monster,

4517
01:54:07,881 --> 01:54:11,210
but Melvin had so many
knock out losses like that.

4518
01:54:11,240 --> 01:54:11,600
His,

4519
01:54:11,600 --> 01:54:13,040
he really can't take a shot anymore,

4520
01:54:13,460 --> 01:54:14,293
unfortunately.

4521
01:54:14,330 --> 01:54:15,500
He just kept k out again.

4522
01:54:15,560 --> 01:54:15,741
Yeah,

4523
01:54:15,741 --> 01:54:16,430
he did.

4524
01:54:16,430 --> 01:54:16,611
Yeah.

4525
01:54:16,611 --> 01:54:19,540
I mean you just get head
kicked again and Beltre we,

4526
01:54:19,560 --> 01:54:20,910
they're just strong jacket.

4527
01:54:21,200 --> 01:54:22,033
Kenny,

4528
01:54:22,100 --> 01:54:22,410
Kenny,

4529
01:54:22,410 --> 01:54:23,171
Jack to kill,

4530
01:54:23,171 --> 01:54:23,840
killing the game.

4531
01:54:23,840 --> 01:54:27,920
Did you guys sell out of those or
what did we ever did we ever did?

4532
01:54:28,390 --> 01:54:28,911
Do you guys,

4533
01:54:28,911 --> 01:54:29,870
when you sell things,

4534
01:54:29,900 --> 01:54:31,040
if you sell a lot of them,

4535
01:54:31,041 --> 01:54:32,010
do you bring them back?

4536
01:54:32,770 --> 01:54:33,231
If they're good,

4537
01:54:33,231 --> 01:54:34,100
we always bring them back.

4538
01:54:34,160 --> 01:54:35,990
We got our summer
collection about the drug.

4539
01:54:36,260 --> 01:54:37,093
What do we got?

4540
01:54:37,610 --> 01:54:38,031
Tees,

4541
01:54:38,031 --> 01:54:38,864
tanks,

4542
01:54:38,870 --> 01:54:39,710
teas and tanks.

4543
01:54:40,530 --> 01:54:41,363
Tasing tanks,

4544
01:54:41,510 --> 01:54:41,811
tees,

4545
01:54:41,811 --> 01:54:42,141
tanks,

4546
01:54:42,141 --> 01:54:42,974
dad hats.

4547
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:45,980
Sp Saki.

4548
01:54:46,700 --> 01:54:47,750
Oh Man.

4549
01:54:47,751 --> 01:54:48,171
OSP.

4550
01:54:48,171 --> 01:54:50,810
We'll take him down and von
flue the fuck out of him.

4551
01:54:50,930 --> 01:54:51,471
Correct.

4552
01:54:51,471 --> 01:54:52,420
That's what I want to see Ya.

4553
01:54:52,780 --> 01:54:56,510
It's just he shouldn't fight a top 10
guy right away to think that's silly.

4554
01:54:57,110 --> 01:54:57,411
I mean,

4555
01:54:57,411 --> 01:55:00,530
I don't know what kind of
experience he hasn't training.

4556
01:55:03,220 --> 01:55:04,580
Let's see him pick it up.

4557
01:55:04,880 --> 01:55:07,020
We'll hit hilarious cm punk.

4558
01:55:08,600 --> 01:55:10,710
He's a lot bigger than cm punk hate.

4559
01:55:10,730 --> 01:55:12,240
It's the Wild Boston days.

4560
01:55:12,530 --> 01:55:17,530
But here is the wild west and you do and
watch the video would be all about cm

4561
01:55:18,891 --> 01:55:19,724
punk training.

4562
01:55:19,850 --> 01:55:20,610
They just,

4563
01:55:20,610 --> 01:55:21,250
they cause the,

4564
01:55:21,250 --> 01:55:22,460
the owners don't what they're doing.

4565
01:55:22,461 --> 01:55:24,380
So she put all their eggs
and see on punks basket.

4566
01:55:24,710 --> 01:55:29,330
Then he gets fucking axe kick to the
skull and cracked his face and half.

4567
01:55:29,390 --> 01:55:30,350
That's what would happen.

4568
01:55:30,390 --> 01:55:32,000
He gets put on,

4569
01:55:33,050 --> 01:55:36,260
put on blast and he's going to
fight again in the UFC as he,

4570
01:55:36,620 --> 01:55:37,340
uh,

4571
01:55:37,340 --> 01:55:37,851
yeah,

4572
01:55:37,851 --> 01:55:38,611
he could easily,

4573
01:55:38,611 --> 01:55:39,860
he is for sure with this,

4574
01:55:39,890 --> 01:55:40,850
with this regime.

4575
01:55:40,970 --> 01:55:41,720
Yeah.

4576
01:55:41,720 --> 01:55:42,291
Look at the,

4577
01:55:42,291 --> 01:55:44,430
UFC is in a weird position right now.

4578
01:55:44,500 --> 01:55:46,710
Connor is not fighting
in the UFC right now.

4579
01:55:46,711 --> 01:55:46,920
I mean,

4580
01:55:46,920 --> 01:55:48,120
he's on hold for this.

4581
01:55:48,121 --> 01:55:49,050
Floyd Mayweather fight.

4582
01:55:49,260 --> 01:55:51,090
Ronda is completely out of the picture.

4583
01:55:51,240 --> 01:55:52,530
Mighty mouse doesn't want to fight.

4584
01:55:52,531 --> 01:55:53,364
Tj.

4585
01:55:53,610 --> 01:55:57,210
Cody is hurt like boy named
the biggest fight of the year.

4586
01:55:57,220 --> 01:55:58,190
Joe,

4587
01:55:59,220 --> 01:56:00,120
it's been a rough year.

4588
01:56:00,150 --> 01:56:02,580
DC John Deasy Johnson
would be the biggest,

4589
01:56:02,820 --> 01:56:03,461
the biggest fan.

4590
01:56:03,461 --> 01:56:04,231
I'm saying so far,

4591
01:56:04,231 --> 01:56:06,160
so far it really hasn't been any bangers.

4592
01:56:06,240 --> 01:56:07,140
What's been his do?

4593
01:56:07,260 --> 01:56:10,410
But what is the big
that the steep bay one,

4594
01:56:10,411 --> 01:56:11,880
but the numbers aren't crazy.

4595
01:56:12,240 --> 01:56:13,073
I'm saying like a needle.

4596
01:56:13,380 --> 01:56:14,340
What were the numbers on that?

4597
01:56:14,880 --> 01:56:15,840
Can you bring that up Jamie?

4598
01:56:15,841 --> 01:56:17,520
I know it wasn't like ground shaking.

4599
01:56:17,970 --> 01:56:18,661
You know what's crazy?

4600
01:56:18,661 --> 01:56:20,140
I was watching Spencer broke yesterday.

4601
01:56:20,141 --> 01:56:20,341
I went,

4602
01:56:20,341 --> 01:56:21,001
Holy Shit.

4603
01:56:21,001 --> 01:56:24,570
Boxing this year is better
than UFC for the first time.

4604
01:56:24,571 --> 01:56:25,500
It allows a pick fight.

4605
01:56:25,650 --> 01:56:27,990
But Boston in general this
year has been killing it.

4606
01:56:28,020 --> 01:56:28,381
Oh yeah.

4607
01:56:28,381 --> 01:56:29,490
And they're making the matchups.

4608
01:56:29,491 --> 01:56:30,870
Everyone wants to see overlap.

4609
01:56:30,871 --> 01:56:31,830
Ward is next week.

4610
01:56:32,150 --> 01:56:32,940
That's next week.

4611
01:56:32,940 --> 01:56:33,773
Next week.

4612
01:56:34,070 --> 01:56:35,120
The second Jesus.

4613
01:56:35,130 --> 01:56:35,530
That's,

4614
01:56:35,530 --> 01:56:35,761
yeah,

4615
01:56:35,761 --> 01:56:35,980
right.

4616
01:56:35,980 --> 01:56:36,813
I know it's two weeks.

4617
01:56:36,840 --> 01:56:37,231
Two weeks,

4618
01:56:37,231 --> 01:56:37,610
two weeks.

4619
01:56:37,610 --> 01:56:37,720
Oh,

4620
01:56:37,720 --> 01:56:38,100
two weeks,

4621
01:56:38,100 --> 01:56:38,300
right.

4622
01:56:38,300 --> 01:56:39,960
It a second Cov lab.

4623
01:56:39,990 --> 01:56:42,480
It's the same weekend as the Aldo fight,

4624
01:56:42,660 --> 01:56:43,230
right?

4625
01:56:43,230 --> 01:56:43,770
No,

4626
01:56:43,770 --> 01:56:44,521
it's after that.

4627
01:56:44,521 --> 01:56:45,320
So week after that,

4628
01:56:45,320 --> 01:56:45,600
I said,

4629
01:56:45,600 --> 01:56:46,000
cause I'm,

4630
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:46,831
I'm in Australia.

4631
01:56:46,831 --> 01:56:47,551
We've got to get back.

4632
01:56:47,551 --> 01:56:48,510
I made sure I fucking,

4633
01:56:48,600 --> 01:56:49,433
I don't want to miss that.

4634
01:56:49,830 --> 01:56:50,663
Nice.

4635
01:56:51,300 --> 01:56:54,150
350,000 pay per view buys.

4636
01:56:54,240 --> 01:56:55,620
That is not that bad.

4637
01:56:57,390 --> 01:56:58,950
So it gives me sir,

4638
01:56:59,010 --> 01:57:01,410
triple g got 150 for paying your bills.

4639
01:57:01,411 --> 01:57:02,100
Triple G.

4640
01:57:02,100 --> 01:57:02,381
I know,

4641
01:57:02,381 --> 01:57:03,214
but isn't that crazy?

4642
01:57:03,270 --> 01:57:03,901
Not really.

4643
01:57:03,901 --> 01:57:05,160
He barely speaks English,

4644
01:57:05,161 --> 01:57:06,440
but he's such a phenomenal box.

4645
01:57:06,441 --> 01:57:06,630
Yeah,

4646
01:57:06,630 --> 01:57:06,931
I know.

4647
01:57:06,931 --> 01:57:09,570
But Canelo Chavez got
over a million paper.

4648
01:57:09,571 --> 01:57:10,920
Canelo doesn't speak English at all.

4649
01:57:11,640 --> 01:57:12,480
He can't a little,

4650
01:57:12,510 --> 01:57:14,100
but he likes to stick
to his native tongue.

4651
01:57:15,330 --> 01:57:16,163
I'm just saying,

4652
01:57:18,310 --> 01:57:22,670
I'll just say Steve Bay doe
sit like that card was a bang.

4653
01:57:23,070 --> 01:57:24,660
He likes to stick to his native tongue.

4654
01:57:24,960 --> 01:57:28,750
I would jack off certain things
you say real sexual flare,

4655
01:57:28,770 --> 01:57:30,580
like sexual innuendo in there.

4656
01:57:30,630 --> 01:57:35,400
I don't know to soaring blackbuck
I'll be a natural funny guy.

4657
01:57:35,401 --> 01:57:36,001
Brian callow.

4658
01:57:36,001 --> 01:57:37,140
Tell us about your tour dates.

4659
01:57:39,930 --> 01:57:43,000
Aren't you sold showing
Ryan date and it just did a,

4660
01:57:43,050 --> 01:57:44,490
we just add x show in Sydney.

4661
01:57:44,491 --> 01:57:45,121
Holy Shit.

4662
01:57:45,121 --> 01:57:45,954
You're sold out in Australia.

4663
01:57:45,960 --> 01:57:46,290
Brian,

4664
01:57:46,290 --> 01:57:49,270
you saw it and I talk about being

4665
01:57:50,910 --> 01:57:52,920
June 8th ninth and 10th you fuckers Joe.

4666
01:57:52,921 --> 01:57:55,150
All I'm saying is 350,000
bytes for that man.

4667
01:57:55,151 --> 01:57:55,341
Do it.

4668
01:57:55,341 --> 01:57:56,161
But that card was,

4669
01:57:56,161 --> 01:57:58,710
so that was the best card to the gear.

4670
01:57:58,800 --> 01:58:00,660
Live gate record for the UFC events.

4671
01:58:00,661 --> 01:58:01,980
The American Airlines Center,

4672
01:58:01,981 --> 01:58:03,120
2.6 million,

4673
01:58:04,110 --> 01:58:07,590
19,000 fans interest
too in 50,000 for that.

4674
01:58:07,710 --> 01:58:08,820
It's crazy to me,

4675
01:58:08,821 --> 01:58:09,060
man.

4676
01:58:09,060 --> 01:58:10,470
That's such a fun card.

4677
01:58:10,530 --> 01:58:11,280
Yeah,

4678
01:58:11,280 --> 01:58:13,650
but it's just when this
weird time where people are,

4679
01:58:13,680 --> 01:58:14,220
you know,

4680
01:58:14,220 --> 01:58:19,220
how old do you think is this going to
do the versus a 50,000 I'd say Joseph

4681
01:58:19,660 --> 01:58:21,240
verse a Holloway in America,

4682
01:58:21,350 --> 01:58:21,760
uh,

4683
01:58:21,760 --> 01:58:23,640
about 27 buys.

4684
01:58:24,970 --> 01:58:25,291
Gary,

4685
01:58:25,291 --> 01:58:25,640
you,

4686
01:58:25,640 --> 01:58:26,520
that's crazy though.

4687
01:58:26,580 --> 01:58:28,170
That's the world we're in right now.

4688
01:58:28,171 --> 01:58:29,004
Ontario.

4689
01:58:29,230 --> 01:58:31,350
I think it talks about
mismanagement by the UFC.

4690
01:58:31,590 --> 01:58:32,680
I think that what you said about,

4691
01:58:32,681 --> 01:58:36,090
it's not frank care giving that
young guy to Frankie Edgar,

4692
01:58:36,240 --> 01:58:38,370
that's a different thing now
that's a different thing.

4693
01:58:38,400 --> 01:58:39,233
You're young.

4694
01:58:39,580 --> 01:58:40,140
Yeah.

4695
01:58:40,140 --> 01:58:44,380
It's just you go through
phases in fighting like box
right now it's killing it

4696
01:58:44,381 --> 01:58:46,150
and they have all these
stars ready to compete.

4697
01:58:46,300 --> 01:58:47,350
You can see right now in that,

4698
01:58:47,351 --> 01:58:48,250
after the fact,

4699
01:58:48,251 --> 01:58:51,010
if [inaudible] did to Frankie
Edgar what he did to Bj Penn,

4700
01:58:51,250 --> 01:58:53,050
you've got a giant superstar in Mexico.

4701
01:58:54,010 --> 01:58:54,880
Let's be fair though,

4702
01:58:54,881 --> 01:58:55,300
Joe.

4703
01:58:55,300 --> 01:58:55,631
Yeah.

4704
01:58:55,631 --> 01:58:57,010
Year fighting.

4705
01:58:57,011 --> 01:58:59,840
Bj Penn is completely different than
the know you're fighting Frankie egg.

4706
01:58:59,841 --> 01:59:00,041
Oh,

4707
01:59:00,041 --> 01:59:04,380
100% like I love Bj Penn
more than a lot of people.

4708
01:59:04,390 --> 01:59:06,150
100% he had no business fighting a year.

4709
01:59:06,280 --> 01:59:07,890
That was a shitty fight to do to budget.

4710
01:59:07,891 --> 01:59:09,780
We found out that he had no business.

4711
01:59:10,450 --> 01:59:11,740
He thought that he did.

4712
01:59:11,800 --> 01:59:13,660
Did we thought he was going
to be able to do something.

4713
01:59:13,661 --> 01:59:14,494
That's crazy.

4714
01:59:14,850 --> 01:59:16,290
Well and then when like,

4715
01:59:16,300 --> 01:59:16,421
yeah,

4716
01:59:16,421 --> 01:59:16,900
you're Frankie,

4717
01:59:16,900 --> 01:59:19,300
but remember the desire asked for Frankie.

4718
01:59:21,610 --> 01:59:21,761
Yeah,

4719
01:59:21,761 --> 01:59:26,510
but you don't just cause he asked for
is it timeless father time sense though.

4720
01:59:27,380 --> 01:59:29,110
It was timeless for Randy coture.

4721
01:59:29,860 --> 01:59:30,221
Well,

4722
01:59:30,221 --> 01:59:31,840
until Machita said is it timeless?

4723
01:59:31,841 --> 01:59:35,560
How's that to flying
front kick coffee shop.

4724
01:59:35,800 --> 01:59:36,880
It's free the night before.

4725
01:59:36,910 --> 01:59:37,660
I'm sorry.

4726
01:59:37,660 --> 01:59:42,130
Volcanoes demeanor me sit Meesha Tsykunov
two guys definitely getting stopped at

4727
01:59:42,131 --> 01:59:42,964
Tsa.

4728
01:59:46,980 --> 01:59:48,480
Your passport's from what?

4729
01:59:48,910 --> 01:59:52,780
Saw it got that name from Dagestan or
something or where the fuck they're from

4730
01:59:52,781 --> 01:59:56,320
but that those names confused the shit
on the tar tar steps there from those.

4731
01:59:56,350 --> 01:59:57,370
That's what I'm saying Bro.

4732
01:59:57,700 --> 02:00:01,930
You look at light heavyweight like
suits and stuff from Toronto fighting a

4733
02:00:01,940 --> 02:00:02,773
Toronto.

4734
02:00:03,930 --> 02:00:05,560
God speaks really good English too,

4735
02:00:05,561 --> 02:00:08,560
by the way and he's a
fucking sick grappler.

4736
02:00:09,190 --> 02:00:10,510
Puts the squeeze on people.

4737
02:00:10,750 --> 02:00:12,010
Number five verse number seven.

4738
02:00:12,040 --> 02:00:12,873
If if,

4739
02:00:12,970 --> 02:00:13,900
if number seven,

4740
02:00:13,901 --> 02:00:16,840
Nisha becomes fucking
champion of the world.

4741
02:00:17,980 --> 02:00:18,731
If you think through it,

4742
02:00:18,731 --> 02:00:20,470
50,000 paper you buys were bad.

4743
02:00:20,500 --> 02:00:21,770
You still have to get real.

4744
02:00:21,771 --> 02:00:23,110
It's real nasty.

4745
02:00:23,420 --> 02:00:25,330
Mean she takes the light
heavyweight champion.

4746
02:00:25,331 --> 02:00:25,660
Yep.

4747
02:00:25,660 --> 02:00:25,931
No,

4748
02:00:25,931 --> 02:00:26,780
no different meters.

4749
02:00:26,830 --> 02:00:27,640
You put on some weight.

4750
02:00:27,640 --> 02:00:28,331
He's a Russian,

4751
02:00:28,331 --> 02:00:31,420
but goddammit and this guy,

4752
02:00:32,350 --> 02:00:33,910
it's a true international sport guys,

4753
02:00:34,200 --> 02:00:34,871
Volk cotton,

4754
02:00:34,871 --> 02:00:35,950
all his demeanor.

4755
02:00:36,220 --> 02:00:37,053
He's the underdog.

4756
02:00:37,300 --> 02:00:38,150
Number five rank.

4757
02:00:39,590 --> 02:00:41,500
How did Austin mere
become number five ranked?

4758
02:00:41,740 --> 02:00:43,000
Because cheeto fingers like yeah,

4759
02:00:43,001 --> 02:00:43,834
let's do it.

4760
02:00:43,870 --> 02:00:44,501
Is that real?

4761
02:00:44,501 --> 02:00:45,490
And he's also a wizard.

4762
02:00:45,790 --> 02:00:46,623
Wait a minute.

4763
02:00:47,910 --> 02:00:49,680
Cause light heavyweight division is it,

4764
02:00:49,681 --> 02:00:50,400
you know,

4765
02:00:50,400 --> 02:00:51,220
chances chest,

4766
02:00:51,220 --> 02:00:55,480
I want to say Austin mirrors only
had a couple of fights in the UFC.

4767
02:00:55,750 --> 02:00:57,640
How many fights is always
knew me or had an EOC,

4768
02:00:57,850 --> 02:00:58,630
young Jamie,

4769
02:00:58,630 --> 02:01:00,630
not a ton and definitely
didn't beat a lot of topics.

4770
02:01:00,970 --> 02:01:02,980
We had a good fight with Osp,

4771
02:01:03,280 --> 02:01:05,410
but I believe he lost lost that fight.

4772
02:01:06,820 --> 02:01:07,481
So many fights.

4773
02:01:07,481 --> 02:01:11,840
Is those Demir had he beat
Osb and a split decision?

4774
02:01:11,850 --> 02:01:12,700
You one.

4775
02:01:12,730 --> 02:01:13,720
Interesting.

4776
02:01:14,110 --> 02:01:17,530
So in beating Osp became
number five in one fight.

4777
02:01:17,590 --> 02:01:19,060
God Dog,

4778
02:01:19,080 --> 02:01:20,620
they are thirsty for people.

4779
02:01:20,850 --> 02:01:22,330
Shogun is number four.

4780
02:01:22,570 --> 02:01:23,403
Whoa.

4781
02:01:23,890 --> 02:01:24,760
It's getting rough.

4782
02:01:25,660 --> 02:01:26,051
Wow,

4783
02:01:26,051 --> 02:01:26,810
that's crazy.

4784
02:01:26,810 --> 02:01:28,060
They can't rank Jon Jones,

4785
02:01:28,061 --> 02:01:30,880
even though John John's going to
fight for the title because he's

4786
02:01:32,770 --> 02:01:33,410
right now.

4787
02:01:33,410 --> 02:01:34,243
Yeah,

4788
02:01:35,320 --> 02:01:35,560
Dude.

4789
02:01:35,560 --> 02:01:37,220
How about [inaudible] it going?

4790
02:01:37,310 --> 02:01:39,230
Still have an agreed on it on.

4791
02:01:39,410 --> 02:01:40,243
Uh Oh.

4792
02:01:40,520 --> 02:01:40,870
Oh,

4793
02:01:40,870 --> 02:01:41,703
oh,

4794
02:01:43,190 --> 02:01:44,023
oh.

4795
02:01:45,260 --> 02:01:46,530
Oh Shit.

4796
02:01:47,470 --> 02:01:49,600
Why don't you sell John Holly?

4797
02:01:49,630 --> 02:01:50,140
Sure.

4798
02:01:50,140 --> 02:01:50,973
Jon Jones,

4799
02:01:53,330 --> 02:01:55,430
he gets on the mic and calls out.

4800
02:01:57,760 --> 02:01:58,710
Call out little nog.

4801
02:01:58,810 --> 02:01:59,020
Oh,

4802
02:01:59,020 --> 02:01:59,900
was Daumier.

4803
02:01:59,960 --> 02:02:01,190
Damn owes to mirror.

4804
02:02:02,360 --> 02:02:05,720
I've been fucking talking about him since
the eighties I guess he's number one

4805
02:02:05,750 --> 02:02:06,583
now.

4806
02:02:06,650 --> 02:02:07,483
Number one,

4807
02:02:07,580 --> 02:02:08,130
Alexander.

4808
02:02:08,130 --> 02:02:10,190
We're going to have to take a step back.

4809
02:02:10,250 --> 02:02:10,670
Listen,

4810
02:02:10,670 --> 02:02:11,481
he's not hurt,

4811
02:02:11,481 --> 02:02:13,700
so we're going to cancel this
fight and we're going to move.

4812
02:02:13,701 --> 02:02:18,701
The main event was demeanor Ozdemir
and it's the highlight of that man.

4813
02:02:19,760 --> 02:02:20,600
So it looks like me.

4814
02:02:20,601 --> 02:02:23,390
She was trying to close the
gap and he just got lit up.

4815
02:02:23,420 --> 02:02:26,610
Let's check this out then up
by the wizard wizard quick k.

4816
02:02:26,611 --> 02:02:27,444
Oh man.

4817
02:02:28,100 --> 02:02:28,761
It looks like a guy.

4818
02:02:28,761 --> 02:02:30,020
I played dungeons and dragons,

4819
02:02:30,021 --> 02:02:33,440
so vocab for cancer
exclusively mob wizardry.

4820
02:02:33,900 --> 02:02:34,760
He's backing him up.

4821
02:02:34,761 --> 02:02:35,271
He's getting lit.

4822
02:02:35,271 --> 02:02:36,110
The fire lit up.

4823
02:02:36,111 --> 02:02:36,561
Boom.

4824
02:02:36,561 --> 02:02:37,394
Hit him right behind the air.

4825
02:02:38,640 --> 02:02:40,130
Short Punch like that.

4826
02:02:40,180 --> 02:02:42,010
Right behind the old tram.

4827
02:02:42,050 --> 02:02:42,321
Wow.

4828
02:02:42,321 --> 02:02:43,130
That's all it takes.

4829
02:02:43,130 --> 02:02:44,840
That's the best light
heavyweight in the world.

4830
02:02:44,870 --> 02:02:45,703
You fucked.

4831
02:02:45,760 --> 02:02:46,940
That is crazy.

4832
02:02:47,020 --> 02:02:47,990
Know he's number one in the world.

4833
02:02:48,380 --> 02:02:49,400
That is not crazy.

4834
02:02:49,401 --> 02:02:50,150
You calm down.

4835
02:02:50,150 --> 02:02:51,890
That is a crazy one.

4836
02:02:51,891 --> 02:02:52,820
Punch knockout,

4837
02:02:53,210 --> 02:02:53,451
man.

4838
02:02:53,451 --> 02:02:55,400
If I ever have to knock somebody
out and they're in my house,

4839
02:02:55,430 --> 02:02:56,091
I'll hit him right there.

4840
02:02:56,091 --> 02:02:57,530
And you said I'm number four,

4841
02:02:57,650 --> 02:02:58,483
Dan.

4842
02:02:58,830 --> 02:03:03,190
I'm never fucking four
now in your crazy though.

4843
02:03:03,210 --> 02:03:03,700
Behind here.

4844
02:03:03,700 --> 02:03:04,221
You go out,

4845
02:03:04,221 --> 02:03:04,490
Huh?

4846
02:03:04,490 --> 02:03:04,760
Yeah.

4847
02:03:04,760 --> 02:03:04,971
Dude,

4848
02:03:04,971 --> 02:03:05,661
I can't wait to see him.

4849
02:03:05,661 --> 02:03:06,021
Verse John.

4850
02:03:06,021 --> 02:03:06,730
June doesn't tell you.

4851
02:03:06,730 --> 02:03:09,090
A lot of guys get hit behind the
ear to get hip on in the year,

4852
02:03:09,091 --> 02:03:10,900
sliding to the side like that.

4853
02:03:11,610 --> 02:03:14,190
Mom does nothing where he
was just getting bombed on.

4854
02:03:14,191 --> 02:03:14,451
It was like,

4855
02:03:14,451 --> 02:03:15,560
fuck boom.

4856
02:03:15,860 --> 02:03:16,700
That's crazy.

4857
02:03:16,730 --> 02:03:17,563
Why is the best?

4858
02:03:21,080 --> 02:03:22,010
Oh my God.

4859
02:03:22,040 --> 02:03:25,600
We're both those Tamir fans fighter and
the kid we are fucking huge is trained

4860
02:03:25,601 --> 02:03:26,780

4861
02:03:26,790 --> 02:03:27,351
long time,

4862
02:03:27,351 --> 02:03:27,801
dude.

4863
02:03:27,801 --> 02:03:29,060
Corey Anderson just fight.

4864
02:03:29,510 --> 02:03:31,250
Corey Anderson fought.

4865
02:03:32,120 --> 02:03:32,953
Who did he just fight?

4866
02:03:33,170 --> 02:03:34,330
So he beat Homeboy,

4867
02:03:34,500 --> 02:03:35,030
uh,

4868
02:03:35,030 --> 02:03:37,700
Brunson and then lots of Jimmy model.

4869
02:03:38,170 --> 02:03:39,150
It's got some nipples on him.

4870
02:03:39,151 --> 02:03:39,711
That's all I know.

4871
02:03:39,711 --> 02:03:41,060
We'll fucked him up man.

4872
02:03:41,790 --> 02:03:43,120
Fuck him up.

4873
02:03:44,350 --> 02:03:45,380
Mannerable lit him up.

4874
02:03:45,480 --> 02:03:46,580
No Brunson Save.

4875
02:03:46,620 --> 02:03:47,480
You pulled that up.

4876
02:03:47,481 --> 02:03:48,810
Pull up the Jimmy Manawat.

4877
02:03:48,840 --> 02:03:50,010
Kao is man.

4878
02:03:50,050 --> 02:03:52,700
What an African name and see from
Africa originally from England,

4879
02:03:52,701 --> 02:03:55,510
but I'm sure African nice here and black.

4880
02:03:55,590 --> 02:03:59,540
You know Jimmy didn't even start fighting
until he was like 28 years old and he

4881
02:03:59,541 --> 02:04:02,570
has first professional boxing match
three months after he started training.

4882
02:04:02,600 --> 02:04:03,140
What?

4883
02:04:03,140 --> 02:04:03,470
Yup.

4884
02:04:03,470 --> 02:04:04,580
So I still have a chance.

4885
02:04:04,760 --> 02:04:05,211
Yes.

4886
02:04:05,211 --> 02:04:05,540
No,

4887
02:04:05,540 --> 02:04:09,590
that's the twice at 28
biologically look at my face.

4888
02:04:09,591 --> 02:04:10,130
No.

4889
02:04:10,130 --> 02:04:10,963
All right.

4890
02:04:11,230 --> 02:04:11,430
Blah,

4891
02:04:11,430 --> 02:04:12,263
blah blah.

4892
02:04:12,270 --> 02:04:13,610
The shitting on Brian continues.

4893
02:04:13,611 --> 02:04:14,660
Everybody had a lies.

4894
02:04:14,690 --> 02:04:15,620
I don't like the law.

4895
02:04:16,090 --> 02:04:16,923
Jimmy.

4896
02:04:16,970 --> 02:04:17,803
Jimmy,

4897
02:04:20,630 --> 02:04:22,670
Jimmy man was a fricking monster.

4898
02:04:22,740 --> 02:04:23,541
He's fun to watch,

4899
02:04:23,541 --> 02:04:25,580
but anytime he's faced a tough test,

4900
02:04:25,581 --> 02:04:26,660
he's never passed it.

4901
02:04:26,690 --> 02:04:27,680
Well clover,

4902
02:04:27,780 --> 02:04:30,380
he's gonna fight 'em work
and he's not actually,

4903
02:04:30,381 --> 02:04:31,011
it doesn't have fight,

4904
02:04:31,011 --> 02:04:32,150
but supposed to fight the gun case.

4905
02:04:32,570 --> 02:04:34,070
He got k owed by rumble,

4906
02:04:34,071 --> 02:04:35,150
which everybody does.

4907
02:04:35,390 --> 02:04:35,720
Well,

4908
02:04:35,720 --> 02:04:37,890
it's such a bomber that
rumble gonna retire.

4909
02:04:38,310 --> 02:04:38,461
Yeah,

4910
02:04:38,461 --> 02:04:39,294
he's out.

4911
02:04:39,390 --> 02:04:40,110
It's crazy.

4912
02:04:40,110 --> 02:04:41,640
Do we know what he's doing for the rams?

4913
02:04:41,720 --> 02:04:42,360
Just,

4914
02:04:42,360 --> 02:04:43,193
I don't know if he's doing,

4915
02:04:43,240 --> 02:04:46,530
he's doing something with the weed is a
weed business and he corrected me cause

4916
02:04:46,531 --> 02:04:46,771
I went,

4917
02:04:46,771 --> 02:04:49,980
how the hell is he doing
CBD stuff with the Rams?

4918
02:04:49,981 --> 02:04:51,810
And he reached out to was like,

4919
02:04:51,811 --> 02:04:52,110
Yo,

4920
02:04:52,110 --> 02:04:53,730
they're not connected full.

4921
02:04:53,960 --> 02:04:58,350
Well I'm doing something with the rams
offs in sports and I'm doing CBD medical

4922
02:04:58,351 --> 02:04:59,220
marijuana over here.

4923
02:04:59,490 --> 02:05:00,570
They're not intertwined,

4924
02:05:00,571 --> 02:05:01,404
asshole.

4925
02:05:02,050 --> 02:05:02,920
My bad,

4926
02:05:03,220 --> 02:05:03,860
my bad,

4927
02:05:03,860 --> 02:05:04,693
my bad.

4928
02:05:05,190 --> 02:05:09,510
It's crazy because he's arguably one of
the most talented guys in the history of

4929
02:05:09,511 --> 02:05:12,030
the division and he gets out on top.

4930
02:05:12,210 --> 02:05:12,900
But listen,

4931
02:05:12,900 --> 02:05:15,600
that's the way to get out and
what his explanation for it was.

4932
02:05:15,601 --> 02:05:16,081
Perfect.

4933
02:05:16,081 --> 02:05:16,231
Look,

4934
02:05:16,231 --> 02:05:17,490
I'm tired of wrestling with dudes.

4935
02:05:17,730 --> 02:05:18,600
I'm tired of getting hit.

4936
02:05:18,630 --> 02:05:20,060
He said I never enjoyed fighting.

4937
02:05:20,061 --> 02:05:20,894
I was just good at it.

4938
02:05:21,540 --> 02:05:22,530
I don't want to do this.

4939
02:05:22,590 --> 02:05:23,310
That's fair.

4940
02:05:23,310 --> 02:05:26,160
A I can freehand good
for him to hell yeah.

4941
02:05:26,161 --> 02:05:26,910
Good for him.

4942
02:05:26,910 --> 02:05:27,510
Good for him.

4943
02:05:27,510 --> 02:05:27,900
What do you do?

4944
02:05:27,900 --> 02:05:29,870
Stick around and there's
three of you up there.

4945
02:05:29,871 --> 02:05:30,230
You're just gonna.

4946
02:05:30,230 --> 02:05:31,410
You're gonna keep fighting.

4947
02:05:31,411 --> 02:05:36,411
Glover fucking Gustafson and Jon
Jones and now my boy fucking Meesha.

4948
02:05:36,840 --> 02:05:37,320
Yeah.

4949
02:05:37,320 --> 02:05:37,800
Yeah.

4950
02:05:37,800 --> 02:05:38,633
No,

4951
02:05:38,820 --> 02:05:38,971
no.

4952
02:05:38,971 --> 02:05:39,800
It's all council,

4953
02:05:39,800 --> 02:05:41,140
Campos demeanor.

4954
02:05:41,490 --> 02:05:42,323
That's all can.

4955
02:05:42,330 --> 02:05:47,190
That is such a crazy stoppage that he
catches him behind the ear like that

4956
02:05:47,191 --> 02:05:48,430
sliding away to me,

4957
02:05:48,440 --> 02:05:48,870

4958
02:05:48,870 --> 02:05:50,490

But let me tell you something.

4964
02:05:55,410 --> 02:05:57,360
Jimmy man was not going
to run at you like that.

4965
02:05:58,530 --> 02:05:59,970
This is crazy me.

4966
02:05:59,971 --> 02:06:01,430
She's coming for look at this.

4967
02:06:02,070 --> 02:06:03,860
Think that's so weird.

4968
02:06:04,500 --> 02:06:05,460
That's so interesting.

4969
02:06:05,520 --> 02:06:06,990
I'll cold good time to do it too.

4970
02:06:06,991 --> 02:06:07,231
Right,

4971
02:06:07,231 --> 02:06:08,880
and I'll be in a fight where you're crazy.

4972
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:11,010
Look at this bow.

4973
02:06:11,820 --> 02:06:12,870
It shuts off.

4974
02:06:12,900 --> 02:06:13,733
She'll be back.

4975
02:06:14,820 --> 02:06:16,230
I just never seen anything like this.

4976
02:06:16,380 --> 02:06:16,651
Do you know?

4977
02:06:16,651 --> 02:06:17,760
This is a big fight for me.

4978
02:06:17,761 --> 02:06:18,120
She too,

4979
02:06:18,120 --> 02:06:20,550
because Misha was almost out of the UFC.

4980
02:06:21,020 --> 02:06:22,920
I had rough negotiations.

4981
02:06:23,490 --> 02:06:27,120
They had rough negotiations and then he
gets starched like that in 10 seconds.

4982
02:06:27,900 --> 02:06:28,740
How many seconds was that?

4983
02:06:28,741 --> 02:06:29,574
If you had to guess?

4984
02:06:29,670 --> 02:06:33,250
About six 12 hmm?

4985
02:06:34,110 --> 02:06:34,800
What are they saying?

4986
02:06:34,800 --> 02:06:35,101
What was it?

4987
02:06:35,101 --> 02:06:37,550
12 preying on them on a tray.

4988
02:06:37,560 --> 02:06:39,670
I mean have the things
to eat that Switzerland,

4989
02:06:40,010 --> 02:06:40,843
Switzerland,

4990
02:06:42,240 --> 02:06:43,470
Switzerland is,

4991
02:06:43,471 --> 02:06:46,170
he can be the best light heavyweight in
the world happened with the Switzerland.

4992
02:06:46,410 --> 02:06:46,591
Yeah,

4993
02:06:46,591 --> 02:06:47,424
you can.

4994
02:06:48,420 --> 02:06:49,253
Okay.

4995
02:06:50,310 --> 02:06:51,143
Here's coriander.

4996
02:06:51,150 --> 02:06:51,751
So that's a good fight.

4997
02:06:51,751 --> 02:06:52,171
It's true.

4998
02:06:52,171 --> 02:06:57,171
Volkov vocal out just beat a
fucking Roy Nelson Mandela to,

4999
02:06:57,840 --> 02:07:00,780
to actually when Manoa knocked out Cory,

5000
02:07:00,781 --> 02:07:01,080
I'm sorry.

5001
02:07:01,080 --> 02:07:02,250
Knocked him out with one punch.

5002
02:07:02,310 --> 02:07:07,310
The real impressive Kayah was manageable
versus Osp Mattawa lit OSP up like he

5003
02:07:08,281 --> 02:07:11,310
was a fucking evergreen
tree in Times Square.

5004
02:07:11,370 --> 02:07:12,060
For sure.

5005
02:07:12,060 --> 02:07:12,893
Just bet.

5006
02:07:12,920 --> 02:07:13,380
Bet.

5007
02:07:13,380 --> 02:07:13,830
Bet.

5008
02:07:13,830 --> 02:07:14,663
Bet.

5009
02:07:14,760 --> 02:07:17,630
You got to see those fluid
combination has Korean it handsome.

5010
02:07:17,890 --> 02:07:20,230
He's got nippled up.

5011
02:07:20,430 --> 02:07:21,750
He's nippled up guys.

5012
02:07:23,700 --> 02:07:26,030
Cory Anderson Black on black crime here.

5013
02:07:27,330 --> 02:07:30,000
He just catches him on their first round.

5014
02:07:30,030 --> 02:07:30,863
You don't at all,

5015
02:07:31,050 --> 02:07:31,291
man.

5016
02:07:31,291 --> 02:07:33,660
I'm so what do you see when
you see people equal rights?

5017
02:07:33,661 --> 02:07:35,010
It's a huge hobby of mine,

5018
02:07:35,020 --> 02:07:35,381
so I don't,

5019
02:07:35,381 --> 02:07:35,760
okay,

5020
02:07:35,760 --> 02:07:36,070
so how

5021
02:07:36,070 --> 02:07:37,330
about the cops come some,

5022
02:07:37,360 --> 02:07:39,340
some guy from Africa robs you.

5023
02:07:39,341 --> 02:07:39,610
Yeah.

5024
02:07:39,610 --> 02:07:41,530
How do you describe
jumping in by describing

5025
02:07:45,790 --> 02:07:46,181
what color?

5026
02:07:46,181 --> 02:07:48,760
The carpet even then I'm furious.

5027
02:07:48,761 --> 02:07:50,920
I describe him as a man was small
calves in a high belly button.

5028
02:07:50,921 --> 02:07:51,754
That's all I say.

5029
02:07:52,090 --> 02:07:52,781
Hi Billy Button.

5030
02:07:52,781 --> 02:07:54,010
I saw doing line,

5031
02:07:54,340 --> 02:07:55,990
I was buying some chicken the other day,

5032
02:07:56,080 --> 02:07:56,913
no racism.

5033
02:07:57,370 --> 02:07:58,150
And uh,

5034
02:07:58,150 --> 02:07:59,740
as I was going to buy some chicken,

5035
02:07:59,741 --> 02:08:00,574
because I'm a white guy,

5036
02:08:01,320 --> 02:08:02,170
I like chicken too.

5037
02:08:02,950 --> 02:08:07,540
There was this guy in line that could
not be anything but black just by like,

5038
02:08:07,570 --> 02:08:09,340
I could like send you a picture.

5039
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:11,710
His ass was so ridiculous.

5040
02:08:12,040 --> 02:08:13,960
It was like this guy was fat too.

5041
02:08:13,961 --> 02:08:15,160
It wasn't like an athlete,

5042
02:08:15,190 --> 02:08:15,900
but he's asking,

5043
02:08:15,900 --> 02:08:16,601
he met up his back.

5044
02:08:16,601 --> 02:08:19,240
He had like a belly and his
upper body looked normal,

5045
02:08:19,480 --> 02:08:21,190
but his ass was literally like,

5046
02:08:21,191 --> 02:08:23,050
he was stealing basketball.

5047
02:08:24,130 --> 02:08:26,070
This guy put a basketball in each.

5048
02:08:26,140 --> 02:08:27,130
Celebrate that.

5049
02:08:27,850 --> 02:08:29,250
I call that the ostrich effect.

5050
02:08:29,290 --> 02:08:30,550
I'll see some Instagram girls,

5051
02:08:30,551 --> 02:08:31,384
same way.

5052
02:08:32,810 --> 02:08:33,670
Instagram girls.

5053
02:08:33,850 --> 02:08:35,500
A lot of those bitches of fake ass.

5054
02:08:35,501 --> 02:08:36,610
If they're black,

5055
02:08:36,640 --> 02:08:37,510
you never know man.

5056
02:08:37,511 --> 02:08:38,400
Just black girls with fake.

5057
02:08:38,640 --> 02:08:39,473
Yeah.

5058
02:08:39,500 --> 02:08:41,470
If the white girl with a black
cast and you know it's a,

5059
02:08:41,480 --> 02:08:42,191
it's a black girl,

5060
02:08:42,191 --> 02:08:42,441
she'll,

5061
02:08:42,441 --> 02:08:42,790
she'll,

5062
02:08:42,790 --> 02:08:43,360
she'll get you.

5063
02:08:43,360 --> 02:08:46,900
Well the white girls that have
those acids that are fake,

5064
02:08:46,930 --> 02:08:49,300
the problem is they
don't have fake thighs.

5065
02:08:49,330 --> 02:08:49,780
That's right.

5066
02:08:49,780 --> 02:08:53,350
So they have these two
pages look like popsicles,

5067
02:08:53,351 --> 02:08:55,000
like those Kim Kardashian pictures.

5068
02:08:55,020 --> 02:08:58,210
You saw this kid event
wondering if those are real sir.

5069
02:08:58,240 --> 02:08:58,810
Yes,

5070
02:08:58,810 --> 02:09:00,490
and so she did get a fake ass here.

5071
02:09:00,491 --> 02:09:01,020
Yes,

5072
02:09:01,020 --> 02:09:03,220
100% here's the way in
this room would have fun.

5073
02:09:03,280 --> 02:09:04,180
Here's what happened.

5074
02:09:04,380 --> 02:09:09,250
What she usually does is bring
fake Paparazzi with her places.

5075
02:09:09,460 --> 02:09:13,750
They take these fake candid photos and
they airbrushed the shit out of him.

5076
02:09:13,960 --> 02:09:15,100
They Photoshop them,

5077
02:09:15,220 --> 02:09:16,690
they make everything look beautiful.

5078
02:09:16,810 --> 02:09:18,460
But when she was in Mexico,

5079
02:09:18,461 --> 02:09:21,360
she got jacked by Real Paparazzi to Mexia.

5080
02:09:21,370 --> 02:09:22,960
I don't give a fuck.

5081
02:09:22,961 --> 02:09:27,880
They were hiding in the bushes and
they did some real Paparazzi pictures.

5082
02:09:27,900 --> 02:09:28,300
Yeah,

5083
02:09:28,300 --> 02:09:29,530
that it's not a good look.

5084
02:09:29,531 --> 02:09:30,730
I was hearing about Paul.

5085
02:09:30,910 --> 02:09:31,061
Oh,

5086
02:09:31,061 --> 02:09:34,260
it's horrible because
they're eating tamales,

5087
02:09:34,310 --> 02:09:35,500
big lumpy,

5088
02:09:35,501 --> 02:09:38,700
dumpy thing and then the legs
of these little skinny things.

5089
02:09:38,710 --> 02:09:39,310
They're not doing any,

5090
02:09:39,310 --> 02:09:39,461
well,

5091
02:09:39,461 --> 02:09:40,180
she's not,

5092
02:09:40,180 --> 02:09:41,350
she's not an athlete.

5093
02:09:41,590 --> 02:09:42,950
Whereas if you look like,

5094
02:09:43,240 --> 02:09:44,830
look at Serina Williams,

5095
02:09:44,831 --> 02:09:46,330
that's what I'm say.

5096
02:09:46,410 --> 02:09:47,243
Fuck

5097
02:09:48,400 --> 02:09:50,790
giant Alpha black female.

5098
02:09:51,140 --> 02:09:55,000
I do it in a sort of a
talking group with her.

5099
02:09:55,360 --> 02:09:56,430
I was looking at her arms.

5100
02:09:56,431 --> 02:09:58,900
She had this very nice little
dress and I was looking at her.

5101
02:09:58,901 --> 02:09:59,670
Beautiful.

5102
02:09:59,670 --> 02:10:00,460
Did she just,

5103
02:10:00,460 --> 02:10:03,390
I literally had to reach out to
one point and grab her spine.

5104
02:10:03,520 --> 02:10:06,880
She's a spazz dude I was backstage
with before she was at the Miami.

5105
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:10,330
Back that up just a hair
young Jamie asks is all,

5106
02:10:10,331 --> 02:10:12,520
it's 100% muscle meat.

5107
02:10:13,150 --> 02:10:13,661
Watch this.

5108
02:10:13,661 --> 02:10:16,150
Watch this Kale a little bit.

5109
02:10:16,210 --> 02:10:18,010
Just a wee bit earlier at washes.

5110
02:10:18,700 --> 02:10:19,820
I don't remember this bank.

5111
02:10:20,170 --> 02:10:21,500
Crazy hub and one is,

5112
02:10:21,880 --> 02:10:22,341
come on man.

5113
02:10:22,341 --> 02:10:23,440
I know it's so accurate.

5114
02:10:23,590 --> 02:10:23,801
Yeah.

5115
02:10:23,801 --> 02:10:27,040
She's a stud athlete and
if you look at her ass,

5116
02:10:27,130 --> 02:10:28,320
her ass is ridiculous.

5117
02:10:28,340 --> 02:10:29,173
As tennis player.

5118
02:10:29,180 --> 02:10:32,800
Best female tennis players say
ridonculous ridonculous Oculus,

5119
02:10:32,830 --> 02:10:34,090
but her legs are too.

5120
02:10:34,110 --> 02:10:34,310
Yeah,

5121
02:10:34,310 --> 02:10:37,190
like her legs fit her ass horse power.

5122
02:10:37,220 --> 02:10:39,080
I feel like everyone here including James,

5123
02:10:39,110 --> 02:10:40,910
a little light in the ass
for her include myself.

5124
02:10:40,970 --> 02:10:42,740
Well she likes but she
likes regular white guy.

5125
02:10:42,741 --> 02:10:43,610
Have you seen her man?

5126
02:10:43,710 --> 02:10:44,260
Her mission?

5127
02:10:44,260 --> 02:10:47,790
Her man looks like she's marrying a guy
who looks like you know he'll dress it

5128
02:10:48,250 --> 02:10:49,083
looks like in here.

5129
02:10:49,250 --> 02:10:50,083
What's that?

5130
02:10:50,240 --> 02:10:51,140
Alexis Ohanian.

5131
02:10:51,650 --> 02:10:52,610
She's marrying him.

5132
02:10:53,150 --> 02:10:53,983
She's pregnant.

5133
02:10:53,990 --> 02:10:55,310
She's pregnant with his baby.

5134
02:10:55,340 --> 02:10:55,430
Well,

5135
02:10:55,430 --> 02:10:55,971
that's ridiculous.

5136
02:10:55,971 --> 02:10:57,380
She knows she fucks him with a strap on.

5137
02:10:57,910 --> 02:10:58,790
I know she does.

5138
02:10:59,240 --> 02:11:00,300
She probably was a mask.

5139
02:11:00,310 --> 02:11:01,280
It's really come out and be like,

5140
02:11:01,290 --> 02:11:06,290
where's a devil mask and puts a strap
on on tennis balls like a racket.

5141
02:11:07,250 --> 02:11:10,430
She rackets him in the ass
hole maximum in the Asil.

5142
02:11:10,520 --> 02:11:11,600
That babies could come out already.

5143
02:11:11,601 --> 02:11:12,680
The sizes of the dad was like,

5144
02:11:12,681 --> 02:11:13,610
who the fuck is this guy?

5145
02:11:14,710 --> 02:11:15,290
Not Know.

5146
02:11:15,290 --> 02:11:15,771
Punishing.

5147
02:11:15,771 --> 02:11:16,011
Wow.

5148
02:11:16,011 --> 02:11:16,700
That's amazing.

5149
02:11:16,700 --> 02:11:17,450
I'm shrinking.

5150
02:11:17,450 --> 02:11:20,550
You can ask them or just blew out of

5151
02:11:22,100 --> 02:11:22,470
Lexis.

5152
02:11:22,470 --> 02:11:22,881
A Nice Guy,

5153
02:11:22,881 --> 02:11:23,990
but that's just ridiculous.

5154
02:11:24,160 --> 02:11:25,700
Good for him for polling.

5155
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:26,811
I'm impressed.

5156
02:11:26,811 --> 02:11:27,644
I like it.

5157
02:11:27,770 --> 02:11:29,000
That's incredibly not afraid.

5158
02:11:29,001 --> 02:11:29,481
Fucking right.

5159
02:11:29,481 --> 02:11:30,560
Your dress them up as a beer.

5160
02:11:32,090 --> 02:11:33,170
That's incredible.

5161
02:11:33,860 --> 02:11:37,160
How did he pull that off to think
we had a shot as a smart guy.

5162
02:11:37,640 --> 02:11:42,640
Maybe he's just Beta enough to sit back
and let her get gorilla fuck by stud

5163
02:11:42,651 --> 02:11:43,510
athletes on the sneaker,

5164
02:11:43,590 --> 02:11:43,880
right,

5165
02:11:43,880 --> 02:11:44,210
sir?

5166
02:11:44,210 --> 02:11:45,080
You're talking about the greatest,

5167
02:11:47,390 --> 02:11:50,780
but don't you think that she's
going to want some like real dick?

5168
02:11:50,870 --> 02:11:51,320
No.

5169
02:11:51,320 --> 02:11:53,960
Or maybe you might have a
real desert Drake before that.

5170
02:11:53,961 --> 02:11:54,720
He's not like,

5171
02:11:54,720 --> 02:11:55,970
he might have a real dick.

5172
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:56,930
Maybe does.

5173
02:11:56,990 --> 02:12:00,790
Oh he might just have the
angry red it dick just,

5174
02:12:01,430 --> 02:12:02,150
yeah,

5175
02:12:02,150 --> 02:12:03,140
and we don't know.

5176
02:12:03,200 --> 02:12:04,280
Or girls don't care that much.

5177
02:12:04,281 --> 02:12:04,920
How about that?

5178
02:12:04,920 --> 02:12:07,190
He pulls it out and smoke
comes out of the nose.

5179
02:12:08,570 --> 02:12:10,300
Like smell like a hawk.

5180
02:12:10,340 --> 02:12:11,173
Oh my God.

5181
02:12:12,740 --> 02:12:13,940
I'm not going to have this conversation.

5182
02:12:14,360 --> 02:12:16,880
Serina fine.

5183
02:12:20,770 --> 02:12:21,560
He just,

5184
02:12:21,560 --> 02:12:23,000
he might just be awesome.

5185
02:12:24,220 --> 02:12:25,053
Awesome.

5186
02:12:26,590 --> 02:12:28,190
My stomach is so full,

5187
02:12:28,430 --> 02:12:31,140
so long to buy gold.

5188
02:12:32,540 --> 02:12:33,373
Cool.

5189
02:12:34,680 --> 02:12:37,070
How about how much you want
that tennis tournament at nine,

5190
02:12:37,130 --> 02:12:38,240
nine weeks pregnant?

5191
02:12:38,360 --> 02:12:39,193
Cause she really,

5192
02:12:39,350 --> 02:12:39,951
oh my God,

5193
02:12:39,951 --> 02:12:41,150
that's fucking monster.

5194
02:12:41,570 --> 02:12:42,820
Let me give you a may me.

5195
02:12:43,100 --> 02:12:44,480
She's such a good athlete,

5196
02:12:44,481 --> 02:12:44,870
man.

5197
02:12:44,870 --> 02:12:45,351
God deck.

5198
02:12:45,351 --> 02:12:49,580
I hit the Jackpot having her baby
didn't amazing for sure James.

5199
02:12:49,640 --> 02:12:50,870
Oh she doesn't need the money.

5200
02:12:50,871 --> 02:12:51,920
She's rich as shit.

5201
02:12:52,160 --> 02:12:52,460
Yup.

5202
02:12:52,460 --> 02:12:54,020
Maybe she just likes nice guys.

5203
02:12:54,021 --> 02:12:55,040
He's a really smart dude.

5204
02:12:55,041 --> 02:12:55,850
He's white guys.

5205
02:12:55,850 --> 02:12:56,590
Yeah.

5206
02:12:56,590 --> 02:12:56,930
Interest.

5207
02:12:56,930 --> 02:12:57,490
He divided.

5208
02:12:57,490 --> 02:12:59,450
She dated to Lavonne
Arrington for a little while.

5209
02:12:59,510 --> 02:12:59,841
Okay.

5210
02:12:59,841 --> 02:13:00,980
How does this fight play out?

5211
02:13:01,310 --> 02:13:01,921
There's glow over.

5212
02:13:01,921 --> 02:13:02,720
Have anything left.

5213
02:13:02,720 --> 02:13:03,021
You know,

5214
02:13:03,021 --> 02:13:04,430
Glover knocked out Rashad,

5215
02:13:04,431 --> 02:13:07,750
but Glover's got a bum shoulder man
and he was having a hard time with his

5216
02:13:07,751 --> 02:13:10,310
shoulder and his last fight
against Jared cannoneer.

5217
02:13:10,370 --> 02:13:11,030
Yeah.

5218
02:13:11,030 --> 02:13:12,200
And he had a hard time in training.

5219
02:13:12,290 --> 02:13:13,440
If Alex done it.

5220
02:13:13,441 --> 02:13:15,440
Gus Finn had his on right.

5221
02:13:15,620 --> 02:13:16,640
He's to me,

5222
02:13:16,641 --> 02:13:18,200
he's the best light
heavyweight in the world.

5223
02:13:18,470 --> 02:13:19,040
Really?

5224
02:13:19,040 --> 02:13:19,370
Yup.

5225
02:13:19,370 --> 02:13:21,090
But DC beat him and Jon Jones,

5226
02:13:21,410 --> 02:13:22,310
I think he beat John.

5227
02:13:22,370 --> 02:13:23,720
I think he beat DC in that flight.

5228
02:13:23,870 --> 02:13:24,111
Well,

5229
02:13:24,111 --> 02:13:24,771
he's the best light.

5230
02:13:24,771 --> 02:13:27,050
Every weight in the world
now that rumbles retired.

5231
02:13:27,650 --> 02:13:29,660
You're saying fight.

5232
02:13:29,661 --> 02:13:30,590
He got headbutted.

5233
02:13:30,740 --> 02:13:31,470
Yeah.

5234
02:13:31,470 --> 02:13:33,870
There's a lot of asterisks
to me talent wise,

5235
02:13:34,020 --> 02:13:34,480
if his,

5236
02:13:34,480 --> 02:13:35,940
if his mind's on right,

5237
02:13:36,210 --> 02:13:38,280
like remember this fight
at one 65 with John,

5238
02:13:39,320 --> 02:13:41,040
but it's two heads colliding.

5239
02:13:41,041 --> 02:13:42,420
It's not like you're
hitting him with a weapon.

5240
02:13:42,450 --> 02:13:44,010
I'm say it's a bit of a freak accident.

5241
02:13:44,780 --> 02:13:45,720
They fight again.

5242
02:13:45,750 --> 02:13:47,040
I bet that fight goes different.

5243
02:13:47,100 --> 02:13:48,720
I'm not saying you'd wind
machine goes debride,

5244
02:13:48,780 --> 02:13:49,590
especially now.

5245
02:13:49,590 --> 02:13:49,800
Yeah.

5246
02:13:49,800 --> 02:13:52,950
You don't think they have the Johnson
that showed up a fight DC would it be,

5247
02:13:52,980 --> 02:13:53,813
would be.

5248
02:13:53,880 --> 02:13:55,610
I think he was on his
way out and that flight.

5249
02:13:55,620 --> 02:13:56,400
That's what I'm saying,

5250
02:13:56,400 --> 02:13:56,941
that fight,

5251
02:13:56,941 --> 02:13:57,680
he just,

5252
02:13:57,680 --> 02:14:00,450
it seemed to me like he really just
did not want to fight anymore in that.

5253
02:14:00,451 --> 02:14:01,260
That's all I'm saying.

5254
02:14:01,260 --> 02:14:02,780
Like when he started clinching with DC,

5255
02:14:02,781 --> 02:14:03,121
I was like,

5256
02:14:03,121 --> 02:14:04,230
what is happening?

5257
02:14:04,610 --> 02:14:04,711
Oh,

5258
02:14:04,711 --> 02:14:05,341
you can take down.

5259
02:14:05,341 --> 02:14:07,200
The Olympiads already had it in his mind.

5260
02:14:07,201 --> 02:14:07,890
It was over.

5261
02:14:07,890 --> 02:14:09,330
He told everyone weeks before.

5262
02:14:09,750 --> 02:14:10,471
That's crazy.

5263
02:14:10,471 --> 02:14:11,091
What was camp at?

5264
02:14:11,091 --> 02:14:11,401
Family.

5265
02:14:11,401 --> 02:14:13,320
I was hearing that he was
barely trained for that fight.

5266
02:14:13,470 --> 02:14:15,930
That's what I was hearing and
I thought it was bullshit.

5267
02:14:15,931 --> 02:14:16,261
I was like,

5268
02:14:16,261 --> 02:14:16,771
come on,

5269
02:14:16,771 --> 02:14:20,100
he's fighting for the title and
I was hearing all kinds of shit.

5270
02:14:20,101 --> 02:14:21,900
Like he came into training four weeks out,

5271
02:14:22,110 --> 02:14:23,550
so I get it.

5272
02:14:23,551 --> 02:14:24,390
But if you're one foot in,

5273
02:14:24,391 --> 02:14:24,931
one foot out,

5274
02:14:24,931 --> 02:14:25,141
you're like,

5275
02:14:25,141 --> 02:14:26,280
I might as well get this money.

5276
02:14:26,520 --> 02:14:29,700
Just try and wrestle because then you
make how much thing you made in that fine

5277
02:14:30,270 --> 02:14:35,270
500,000 so I'm Glover is a guy that if
he didn't have those six years outside of

5278
02:14:38,311 --> 02:14:38,881
the UFC,

5279
02:14:38,881 --> 02:14:40,200
I feel like it could've been a champ.

5280
02:14:40,560 --> 02:14:41,880
Not with Jon Jones at the helm.

5281
02:14:41,940 --> 02:14:42,121
No,

5282
02:14:42,121 --> 02:14:43,140
he wouldn't have been a champion.

5283
02:14:43,141 --> 02:14:44,010
John John's at the helm.

5284
02:14:44,220 --> 02:14:45,630
It would have been before Jon Jones,

5285
02:14:45,750 --> 02:14:47,280
who was before John Shogun.

5286
02:14:47,310 --> 02:14:47,550
Yeah,

5287
02:14:47,550 --> 02:14:48,030
you're right.

5288
02:14:48,030 --> 02:14:48,630
It's fair.

5289
02:14:48,630 --> 02:14:50,100
He could have probably got a chance.

5290
02:14:50,130 --> 02:14:50,963
He had a chance.

5291
02:14:51,020 --> 02:14:52,480
He just got right.

5292
02:14:52,570 --> 02:14:52,730
Yeah.

5293
02:14:52,730 --> 02:14:55,380
It was the visa issue
for six fucking years.

5294
02:14:55,530 --> 02:14:56,730
When he was in his prime.

5295
02:14:57,240 --> 02:14:58,260
He was one guy,

5296
02:14:58,261 --> 02:14:59,970
like when he destroyed.

5297
02:14:59,971 --> 02:15:04,971
So could you in the WEC back when the
WBC was in northern California in the

5298
02:15:05,491 --> 02:15:05,941
middle of nowhere.

5299
02:15:05,941 --> 02:15:06,480
I remember that.

5300
02:15:06,480 --> 02:15:06,661
Yeah.

5301
02:15:06,661 --> 02:15:09,690
With Reed was running that read
his love for you to just love read.

5302
02:15:09,690 --> 02:15:10,523
He's great guy.

5303
02:15:10,770 --> 02:15:11,790
He's still with the EOC.

5304
02:15:11,880 --> 02:15:12,481
Yes,

5305
02:15:12,481 --> 02:15:13,314
I love that guy.

5306
02:15:13,350 --> 02:15:15,210
But when Glover back in those days,

5307
02:15:15,211 --> 02:15:16,680
Glover was a fucking destroyer,

5308
02:15:16,770 --> 02:15:18,270
like a God damn destroyer.

5309
02:15:18,271 --> 02:15:19,620
It was like the Brazilian boogey man.

5310
02:15:19,650 --> 02:15:20,131
Everyone was like,

5311
02:15:20,131 --> 02:15:20,680
dude,

5312
02:15:20,680 --> 02:15:21,930
wait until this guy gets to the UFC.

5313
02:15:22,310 --> 02:15:23,120
He just,

5314
02:15:23,120 --> 02:15:26,160
they're trying to figure out as visa
and then chuck Ladell signed off on them

5315
02:15:26,161 --> 02:15:28,830
and have them in signed off and
then by the time he got there,

5316
02:15:29,100 --> 02:15:31,290
you know you had that
rampage fight was in grade.

5317
02:15:31,320 --> 02:15:31,471
Well,

5318
02:15:31,471 --> 02:15:34,560
he fought Kyle Kingsbury and smoked
them and then everybody was like Walden.

5319
02:15:34,561 --> 02:15:35,820
Nono remaining found him,

5320
02:15:35,970 --> 02:15:37,230
but Maldonado clipped him.

5321
02:15:37,350 --> 02:15:38,040
Remember that?

5322
02:15:38,040 --> 02:15:40,300
Gave him the chicken
dance walled analysis.

5323
02:15:40,350 --> 02:15:40,621
These,

5324
02:15:40,621 --> 02:15:45,621
that secret fricking dad bod box Brazilian
boxy clip fade or he beat fade or so

5325
02:15:46,621 --> 02:15:47,520
I think he should have been,

5326
02:15:48,010 --> 02:15:49,200
I should have beat in Russia.

5327
02:15:49,760 --> 02:15:50,041
They're like,

5328
02:15:50,041 --> 02:15:50,311
Nah,

5329
02:15:50,311 --> 02:15:51,144
you're good.

5330
02:15:51,390 --> 02:15:51,901
Yeah,

5331
02:15:51,901 --> 02:15:52,734
I don't think so.

5332
02:15:52,960 --> 02:15:53,341
Come on,

5333
02:15:53,341 --> 02:15:53,550
Bro.

5334
02:15:53,550 --> 02:15:53,940
Yeah man.

5335
02:15:53,940 --> 02:15:54,510
He tried to,

5336
02:15:54,510 --> 02:15:56,610
he tried to protest like
you should have protest.

5337
02:15:56,611 --> 02:16:01,200
The fact that you got on a plane and
went to Russia protested anywhere else.

5338
02:16:01,201 --> 02:16:02,340
He won that fight kid.

5339
02:16:02,520 --> 02:16:02,970
It's true,

5340
02:16:02,970 --> 02:16:03,240
man.

5341
02:16:03,240 --> 02:16:05,520
I mean by the new scoring
he wanted in a big way.

5342
02:16:05,590 --> 02:16:06,150
Easily.

5343
02:16:06,150 --> 02:16:06,570
Yeah,

5344
02:16:06,570 --> 02:16:07,403
for sure.

5345
02:16:08,040 --> 02:16:08,790
I mean for Fader,

5346
02:16:08,790 --> 02:16:09,623
never really heard him.

5347
02:16:09,960 --> 02:16:10,640
Never.

5348
02:16:10,640 --> 02:16:10,850
No,

5349
02:16:10,850 --> 02:16:14,220
but he heard the shit out of fate or he
had a paid or queer straight would have

5350
02:16:14,221 --> 02:16:15,120
stopped that fight.

5351
02:16:15,121 --> 02:16:15,960
In America.

5352
02:16:15,961 --> 02:16:16,770
A lot of times,

5353
02:16:16,770 --> 02:16:19,620
especially in New York though fade or
took a term where all the men were Marin

5354
02:16:19,621 --> 02:16:20,454
dresses,

5355
02:16:21,260 --> 02:16:22,860
those queer street.

5356
02:16:23,670 --> 02:16:25,240
What do you think happened with
fatal or Mitch [inaudible]?

5357
02:16:25,530 --> 02:16:27,450
Mitch reone easily could knock 'em out.

5358
02:16:27,750 --> 02:16:28,410
Yeah,

5359
02:16:28,410 --> 02:16:28,920
early on.

5360
02:16:28,920 --> 02:16:30,070
I just think that fate

5361
02:16:30,070 --> 02:16:33,490
or is still fade or in bursts,

5362
02:16:33,670 --> 02:16:35,740
but I just think if you
look at the Maldonado fight,

5363
02:16:35,950 --> 02:16:36,220
look,

5364
02:16:36,220 --> 02:16:38,290
you're not talking about
fate or is private paid.

5365
02:16:38,291 --> 02:16:39,340
One is prime kills,

5366
02:16:39,341 --> 02:16:40,174
mitre own.

5367
02:16:40,360 --> 02:16:41,081
You go back to fade,

5368
02:16:41,081 --> 02:16:42,640
orange pride and the pride days,

5369
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:43,990
but mitre on his way,

5370
02:16:43,991 --> 02:16:48,490
closer to his prime then fade or is
Mitch and Mitch reone has a Chin like a

5371
02:16:48,491 --> 02:16:50,000
motherfucker still Roy.

5372
02:16:50,001 --> 02:16:50,834
He knocked him out.

5373
02:16:51,030 --> 02:16:51,810
Oh boy.

5374
02:16:51,810 --> 02:16:52,451
Tki owed him.

5375
02:16:52,451 --> 02:16:53,560
He didn't knock him flatland,

5376
02:16:54,250 --> 02:16:54,790
flatland,

5377
02:16:54,790 --> 02:16:57,540
hit him with a hammer and dropped
and dropped and then I'm like,

5378
02:16:57,880 --> 02:16:58,151
you know,

5379
02:16:58,151 --> 02:16:59,320
Rhonda style or something like that.

5380
02:16:59,321 --> 02:17:02,320
I like Mark Kahn was only
a couple of punches though.

5381
02:17:02,480 --> 02:17:02,680
Yeah,

5382
02:17:02,680 --> 02:17:04,590
but I'm just saying he
didn't like flat flat line.

5383
02:17:04,591 --> 02:17:05,380
Yeah but we,

5384
02:17:05,380 --> 02:17:09,220
we both agree he could take it and mitre
on is a way better athlete Mitro and is

5385
02:17:09,221 --> 02:17:10,120
fastened his feet.

5386
02:17:10,240 --> 02:17:11,680
If Mitre on fight smart,

5387
02:17:11,710 --> 02:17:13,000
I think he can win that fight.

5388
02:17:13,060 --> 02:17:13,860
Just had put that,

5389
02:17:13,860 --> 02:17:14,501
that's the key.

5390
02:17:14,501 --> 02:17:17,770
There's has to fight smart and
people get mad at me for saying that,

5391
02:17:17,771 --> 02:17:20,110
but I'm just saying fade
or in this day and age,

5392
02:17:20,140 --> 02:17:23,210
this fade or the today fade
or it's got all those tattoos.

5393
02:17:23,520 --> 02:17:24,340
Chest.

5394
02:17:24,340 --> 02:17:26,500
A lot of people would a
lot of fade or fanboys.

5395
02:17:26,570 --> 02:17:27,880
Oh dammit.

5396
02:17:28,600 --> 02:17:30,610
It's 2017 you fucks.

5397
02:17:30,880 --> 02:17:34,360
It's just hard when I get mad cause he
said wonder they had fucking surgery on

5398
02:17:34,361 --> 02:17:34,781
his face.

5399
02:17:34,781 --> 02:17:35,920
It's life shit happen.

5400
02:17:35,921 --> 02:17:40,810
I would like to see fade or take the veto
route and get over to rising and let's

5401
02:17:40,811 --> 02:17:41,890
get this party started.

5402
02:17:41,950 --> 02:17:42,161
You know,

5403
02:17:42,161 --> 02:17:44,170
just stay in Belgium and
just keep it in Russia.

5404
02:17:45,070 --> 02:17:50,070
Cabinet isn't trained in Sweden or does
he have a camp and that all these glass

5405
02:17:50,231 --> 02:17:51,064
bottles,

5406
02:17:51,070 --> 02:17:51,371
listen,

5407
02:17:51,371 --> 02:17:52,204
these books,

5408
02:17:52,480 --> 02:17:54,970
these glass bottles or victory solid name.

5409
02:17:55,210 --> 02:17:56,490
Let's bring it back to that.

5410
02:17:56,500 --> 02:18:00,890
The golden years t we're going to get
you on the TRT bunch of gets done.

5411
02:18:00,900 --> 02:18:05,830
Then I get on that a Hugh Jackman sauce
and I draw a 50 and a trial cannot the

5412
02:18:05,840 --> 02:18:06,820
shit that makes you grow.

5413
02:18:06,821 --> 02:18:07,654
Eyebrow hair.

5414
02:18:09,020 --> 02:18:13,810
If your forehead starts
getting hairy and and shorter.

5415
02:18:17,020 --> 02:18:18,340
Right here you got somebody,

5416
02:18:18,600 --> 02:18:18,890
uh,

5417
02:18:18,890 --> 02:18:19,490
what,

5418
02:18:19,490 --> 02:18:22,510
where does he train Gustafson in Sweden
or does he have his camp somewhere else?

5419
02:18:22,800 --> 02:18:23,230
Um,

5420
02:18:23,230 --> 02:18:24,370
that's a good question.

5421
02:18:24,390 --> 02:18:25,380
And he doesn't use,

5422
02:18:25,430 --> 02:18:27,640
do a lot of alliance in San Diego,

5423
02:18:27,670 --> 02:18:28,503
but I don't know.

5424
02:18:28,670 --> 02:18:29,850
This camp in Sweden did.

5425
02:18:29,930 --> 02:18:30,100
Yeah,

5426
02:18:30,100 --> 02:18:32,350
the whole camp we'll
manimal was with them.

5427
02:18:32,380 --> 02:18:34,890
I know Manoa did some training
with them and other tramps,

5428
02:18:35,470 --> 02:18:35,891
tattoos,

5429
02:18:35,891 --> 02:18:36,570
the tattoos.

5430
02:18:36,570 --> 02:18:38,080
And he's got a native American,

5431
02:18:38,500 --> 02:18:40,210
he's got a wolf and he's got the,

5432
02:18:40,540 --> 02:18:41,440
is that the club?

5433
02:18:41,480 --> 02:18:42,610
I could jack of spades.

5434
02:18:42,840 --> 02:18:43,240
Yeah.

5435
02:18:43,240 --> 02:18:44,770
And he's got all those little lines,

5436
02:18:44,771 --> 02:18:45,760
or like when he fights,

5437
02:18:45,761 --> 02:18:47,320
every time he fights he gets a new one.

5438
02:18:47,321 --> 02:18:50,560
And the ones that he wins are dark
and the ones that he loses or white,

5439
02:18:50,890 --> 02:18:51,790
and then the ones that he'd get,

5440
02:18:51,800 --> 02:18:52,551
I guess I draw.

5441
02:18:52,551 --> 02:18:52,871
I was like a,

5442
02:18:52,871 --> 02:18:53,340
how do I,

5443
02:18:53,340 --> 02:18:54,490
that might be my tattoo.

5444
02:18:54,670 --> 02:18:55,960
It's a touch of white lines.

5445
02:18:56,040 --> 02:18:57,550
Gustafson is the top two daddies.

5446
02:18:58,480 --> 02:18:59,291
He's also a dude.

5447
02:18:59,291 --> 02:18:59,591
Yeah,

5448
02:18:59,591 --> 02:19:00,940
Gloria's has been around those six years.

5449
02:19:00,941 --> 02:19:01,691
Cost him hard,

5450
02:19:01,691 --> 02:19:02,070
man.

5451
02:19:02,070 --> 02:19:02,560
Fuck that.

5452
02:19:02,560 --> 02:19:03,760
There'd been this goddamn prime.

5453
02:19:03,761 --> 02:19:04,130
Right?

5454
02:19:04,130 --> 02:19:05,180
Have you spent a lot of time,

5455
02:19:05,260 --> 02:19:06,790
like the nicest guy ever?

5456
02:19:06,820 --> 02:19:07,180
Clovers,

5457
02:19:07,180 --> 02:19:09,580
the best savage behind the eyes
and you think you hate you,

5458
02:19:09,581 --> 02:19:10,450
but really he's cool.

5459
02:19:10,480 --> 02:19:11,313
He's a sweetheart.

5460
02:19:11,510 --> 02:19:12,101
He's a really,

5461
02:19:12,101 --> 02:19:12,934
really good guy.

5462
02:19:12,970 --> 02:19:14,620
Brazilian with a Russian mentality.

5463
02:19:14,770 --> 02:19:14,891
Oh,

5464
02:19:14,891 --> 02:19:15,724
he's a killer.

5465
02:19:16,360 --> 02:19:17,051
And you know,

5466
02:19:17,051 --> 02:19:17,441
I mean,

5467
02:19:17,441 --> 02:19:20,110
it didn't help that he was
fucking left out for six years.

5468
02:19:20,140 --> 02:19:20,471
Well look,

5469
02:19:20,471 --> 02:19:22,000
he put Rashad away last year,

5470
02:19:22,240 --> 02:19:23,080
but then Glover,

5471
02:19:23,320 --> 02:19:24,790
I mean a rampage,

5472
02:19:24,910 --> 02:19:25,451
excuse me,

5473
02:19:25,451 --> 02:19:25,901
a rumble,

5474
02:19:25,901 --> 02:19:28,210
put them away with one
punch bump with knocked

5475
02:19:28,240 --> 02:19:29,073
his teeth out.

5476
02:19:29,120 --> 02:19:31,000
He knocked his fucking sold out.

5477
02:19:31,010 --> 02:19:32,510
His soul had to come back down.

5478
02:19:32,630 --> 02:19:34,970
Gravity had to put his soul back down.

5479
02:19:35,020 --> 02:19:39,110
And you see how far that tooth went crazy.

5480
02:19:39,170 --> 02:19:39,841
Especially in slow.

5481
02:19:39,841 --> 02:19:40,160
She was,

5482
02:19:40,160 --> 02:19:41,210
I thought that was CGI.

5483
02:19:41,211 --> 02:19:42,200
Is it definitely a tooth?

5484
02:19:42,201 --> 02:19:43,034
It flew out of his mouth.

5485
02:19:43,550 --> 02:19:44,390
I think it was spit.

5486
02:19:44,600 --> 02:19:46,040
I think a Gustafson.

5487
02:19:46,070 --> 02:19:47,000
If he shows up,

5488
02:19:47,001 --> 02:19:47,900
shouldn't merch blow?

5489
02:19:47,901 --> 02:19:48,050
Right?

5490
02:19:48,050 --> 02:19:48,650
Hate to tell you.

5491
02:19:48,650 --> 02:19:49,311
I think it works.

5492
02:19:49,311 --> 02:19:50,000
I mean interest.

5493
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:50,840
I think you beat them up.

5494
02:19:51,050 --> 02:19:51,883
Interesting.

5495
02:19:52,250 --> 02:19:55,940
And then Glover be ranking way
behind my boy who just won tonight.

5496
02:19:59,240 --> 02:20:01,520
I'm really interested to see
that mature on fade or fight.

5497
02:20:01,580 --> 02:20:02,413
I'm going to buy that.

5498
02:20:02,540 --> 02:20:03,530
I'll buy that on paper view.

5499
02:20:03,650 --> 02:20:08,650
I'm also really interested
in to see Lorens Larkin
Lorez mark and versus Douglas

5500
02:20:09,170 --> 02:20:10,003
Lema.

5501
02:20:10,100 --> 02:20:10,760
Which one?

5502
02:20:10,760 --> 02:20:11,410
Diego Lima's.

5503
02:20:11,410 --> 02:20:13,240
The UFC guy was fighting in the UFC.

5504
02:20:13,280 --> 02:20:14,120
The Douglas Lema.

5505
02:20:14,170 --> 02:20:14,460
Yeah.

5506
02:20:14,460 --> 02:20:15,080
Douglas Lema.

5507
02:20:15,080 --> 02:20:15,681
The bell torture.

5508
02:20:15,681 --> 02:20:15,920
Yeah.

5509
02:20:15,920 --> 02:20:16,340
Correct.

5510
02:20:16,340 --> 02:20:17,690
He's a fucking duties.

5511
02:20:17,691 --> 02:20:18,620
Chandler too.

5512
02:20:18,621 --> 02:20:21,320
I love watching that
card is fucking posey.

5513
02:20:21,530 --> 02:20:26,530
Rory motherfucking macdonald looked as
good as any welterweight on the planet.

5514
02:20:27,470 --> 02:20:28,010
He is.

5515
02:20:28,010 --> 02:20:29,000
He might be champ,

5516
02:20:29,020 --> 02:20:29,230
you know,

5517
02:20:29,230 --> 02:20:29,931
beat the champion,

5518
02:20:29,931 --> 02:20:31,520
be Damien by and lost
the wonder Wonderboy.

5519
02:20:31,521 --> 02:20:32,340
But still,

5520
02:20:32,340 --> 02:20:32,921
he's the one who bought it,

5521
02:20:32,921 --> 02:20:34,010
but his nose was jacked.

5522
02:20:34,020 --> 02:20:34,853
Her fight.

5523
02:20:34,880 --> 02:20:36,260
How good did he look?

5524
02:20:36,290 --> 02:20:37,160
Phenomenal.

5525
02:20:37,550 --> 02:20:38,960
And then he said it and they go,

5526
02:20:38,961 --> 02:20:39,980
do you have a message for,

5527
02:20:39,981 --> 02:20:40,570
uh,

5528
02:20:40,570 --> 02:20:40,820
uh,

5529
02:20:40,820 --> 02:20:41,870
Lima or,

5530
02:20:41,871 --> 02:20:42,410
uh,

5531
02:20:42,410 --> 02:20:45,500
a month or a fucking like Larkin?

5532
02:20:45,920 --> 02:20:46,300
He goes,

5533
02:20:46,300 --> 02:20:46,840
ah,

5534
02:20:46,840 --> 02:20:48,860
I'm going to take your belt
on the take your health.

5535
02:20:48,930 --> 02:20:49,310
Yeah,

5536
02:20:49,310 --> 02:20:50,143
I'm out.

5537
02:20:50,390 --> 02:20:52,730
I'm going to take your belt and dead.

5538
02:20:52,731 --> 02:20:53,540
Serious.

5539
02:20:53,540 --> 02:20:54,373
Dead serious.

5540
02:20:54,890 --> 02:20:55,723
He's dead Sara.

5541
02:20:56,040 --> 02:20:56,241
Well,

5542
02:20:56,241 --> 02:20:56,500
he,

5543
02:20:56,500 --> 02:20:56,990
he,

5544
02:20:56,990 --> 02:21:01,100
he told me that he spent a lot of time
working on improving his game while he

5545
02:21:01,101 --> 02:21:02,870
was taking the time off to heal his nose.

5546
02:21:03,080 --> 02:21:03,381
He's like,

5547
02:21:03,381 --> 02:21:04,520
he's just sparked too much as no,

5548
02:21:04,530 --> 02:21:06,500
just kept opening up and
it was a real problem.

5549
02:21:06,680 --> 02:21:07,790
His nose got smashed in.

5550
02:21:07,791 --> 02:21:08,810
The Robbie Lawler fight.

5551
02:21:08,811 --> 02:21:09,410
He never,

5552
02:21:09,410 --> 02:21:11,160
never gave a chance to see.

5553
02:21:11,280 --> 02:21:12,260
He said when he got hit,

5554
02:21:12,470 --> 02:21:13,820
it all went white in the blood,

5555
02:21:13,821 --> 02:21:15,540
like rushed into the,

5556
02:21:15,770 --> 02:21:16,580
his face.

5557
02:21:16,580 --> 02:21:17,730
He said everything was white.

5558
02:21:17,731 --> 02:21:18,361
He just couldn't see him.

5559
02:21:18,361 --> 02:21:18,591
He was like,

5560
02:21:18,591 --> 02:21:19,340
fuck.

5561
02:21:19,340 --> 02:21:20,081
Because who knows Roy?

5562
02:21:20,081 --> 02:21:22,850
He knows he's a monster warrior.

5563
02:21:22,970 --> 02:21:23,601
Like they're happy.

5564
02:21:23,601 --> 02:21:24,920
Some batch it again to stop.

5565
02:21:25,990 --> 02:21:29,270
I Glover's taller than I thought.

5566
02:21:29,271 --> 02:21:30,350
I mean it's a big dude.

5567
02:21:30,410 --> 02:21:33,620
I don't know if the angle of the camera
cameras the angle Guston's fucking six

5568
02:21:33,621 --> 02:21:34,190
six.

5569
02:21:34,190 --> 02:21:35,500
He's Tustin's huge.

5570
02:21:35,540 --> 02:21:36,373
Yeah.

5571
02:21:36,410 --> 02:21:36,800
Um,

5572
02:21:36,800 --> 02:21:40,280
Glover has a fucked up right
shoulder from the John Jones fight.

5573
02:21:40,430 --> 02:21:43,010
Jon Jones Glover had an
under hook on John Jones.

5574
02:21:43,011 --> 02:21:46,330
John Jones wrap the arm
and yanked his shoulder.

5575
02:21:46,400 --> 02:21:47,233
It was [inaudible].

5576
02:21:48,230 --> 02:21:50,590
I get so nervous for a guy who
was fighting in his home town.

5577
02:21:50,840 --> 02:21:51,560
How good is John?

5578
02:21:51,560 --> 02:21:53,020
John Dismantle Clever.

5579
02:21:53,021 --> 02:21:53,271
I was like,

5580
02:21:53,271 --> 02:21:53,700
Oh you,

5581
02:21:53,700 --> 02:21:53,850
oh,

5582
02:21:53,850 --> 02:21:54,321
you're good.

5583
02:21:54,321 --> 02:21:55,154
Check this up.

5584
02:21:55,190 --> 02:21:56,023
Yeah.

5585
02:21:56,480 --> 02:21:58,970
If I see one more advertisement
for fucking Logan,

5586
02:21:58,971 --> 02:22:00,860
I'm about to bust bust.

5587
02:22:01,340 --> 02:22:02,970
They are really coming hard with that.

5588
02:22:02,980 --> 02:22:06,880
Logan had God get it out of my face
in alcoholic and it forgot aggressive.

5589
02:22:07,250 --> 02:22:08,061
I like the way this guy,

5590
02:22:08,061 --> 02:22:10,550
I liked the way customers is moving guys.

5591
02:22:10,610 --> 02:22:14,000
Sad side to it right now it goes through
in wrestling too is very underrated.

5592
02:22:14,001 --> 02:22:16,450
But clover can grapple
the best of black belt.

5593
02:22:16,460 --> 02:22:17,840
Ahboo dobby competition.

5594
02:22:17,841 --> 02:22:21,800
He's a monster who could
kick more knocked out.

5595
02:22:21,801 --> 02:22:25,170
Power Clover Club is great boxer man.

5596
02:22:26,790 --> 02:22:27,480
Nice uppercut.

5597
02:22:27,480 --> 02:22:28,110
Oh boy.

5598
02:22:28,110 --> 02:22:28,943
Be careful.

5599
02:22:29,670 --> 02:22:30,480
Okay.

5600
02:22:30,480 --> 02:22:30,870
Alright.

5601
02:22:30,870 --> 02:22:31,290
Alright,

5602
02:22:31,290 --> 02:22:32,123
let's calm down.

5603
02:22:32,450 --> 02:22:33,283
Calm down.

5604
02:22:33,980 --> 02:22:35,580
Glover also underwriting wrestling.

5605
02:22:35,640 --> 02:22:36,230
Ah,

5606
02:22:36,230 --> 02:22:36,661
that's right.

5607
02:22:36,661 --> 02:22:38,340
On the city is grappling is really,

5608
02:22:38,341 --> 02:22:39,174
really good.

5609
02:22:40,920 --> 02:22:44,870
Good Little San Francisco guests
and loses again as hometown.

5610
02:22:44,871 --> 02:22:46,780
It's a little nervous sometimes.

5611
02:22:47,090 --> 02:22:47,910
He's a little nervous.

5612
02:22:47,910 --> 02:22:52,380
Remember we got lost a fucking Johnson
and his home town was mia for a fucking

5613
02:22:52,380 --> 02:22:52,530
year.

5614
02:22:52,530 --> 02:22:54,540
It's tough when you're
the hometown hero man.

5615
02:22:54,770 --> 02:22:55,351
Well it's also,

5616
02:22:55,351 --> 02:22:59,460
you trained so hard for this one big
moment and then you lose and you got to

5617
02:22:59,461 --> 02:23:00,300
like reassess.

5618
02:23:00,301 --> 02:23:01,050
Like where am I?

5619
02:23:01,050 --> 02:23:02,580
He was on billboards and shit.

5620
02:23:02,610 --> 02:23:06,420
He still only 30 that's another
thing to think about with Alexander.

5621
02:23:06,580 --> 02:23:07,470
He's 30 years old.

5622
02:23:07,471 --> 02:23:08,640
He's in his athletic prime.

5623
02:23:08,650 --> 02:23:09,810
It's just a little nervous right now.

5624
02:23:09,900 --> 02:23:10,780
I feel like you dare you.

5625
02:23:10,920 --> 02:23:11,461
How dare he?

5626
02:23:11,461 --> 02:23:12,240
Little hesitant.

5627
02:23:12,240 --> 02:23:13,380
I dare you judge this man.

5628
02:23:15,250 --> 02:23:16,083
I'm nervous.

5629
02:23:16,360 --> 02:23:17,740
I'm going to have him
tweet about your writing.

5630
02:23:17,980 --> 02:23:19,090
Don't you fucking dare to,

5631
02:23:21,700 --> 02:23:24,500
how funny would that trolling
me about my fucking writing?

5632
02:23:25,300 --> 02:23:26,250
Oh,

5633
02:23:26,770 --> 02:23:28,230
oh there you got to write here.

5634
02:23:29,430 --> 02:23:30,290
Oh Nice.

5635
02:23:30,550 --> 02:23:31,383
Wow.

5636
02:23:31,450 --> 02:23:31,691
Yeah,

5637
02:23:31,691 --> 02:23:32,340
he's twice.

5638
02:23:32,340 --> 02:23:33,070
He was hesitant.

5639
02:23:33,070 --> 02:23:33,851
He just loosen up.

5640
02:23:33,851 --> 02:23:35,890
John Gustafson cause of that rumble,

5641
02:23:36,230 --> 02:23:39,760
that jab son told him to come forward.

5642
02:23:39,761 --> 02:23:40,271
Need Up.

5643
02:23:40,271 --> 02:23:40,900
What keeps you?

5644
02:23:40,900 --> 02:23:43,270
I don't like get away
from that right hand,

5645
02:23:43,930 --> 02:23:44,763
man,

5646
02:23:45,220 --> 02:23:45,461
man.

5647
02:23:45,461 --> 02:23:46,330
Cause this is good though.

5648
02:23:46,360 --> 02:23:47,193
Oh,

5649
02:23:47,700 --> 02:23:48,890
it's called little checkup there.

5650
02:23:48,891 --> 02:23:50,170
I used to wake him up called call.

5651
02:23:50,171 --> 02:23:51,004
Wake me up.

5652
02:23:55,110 --> 02:23:55,680
All right.

5653
02:23:55,680 --> 02:23:56,720
She was just avoiding it.

5654
02:23:56,721 --> 02:23:57,501
That's smart man.

5655
02:23:57,501 --> 02:23:58,334
Good movement.

5656
02:23:58,340 --> 02:24:00,350
That's the Overeem tactic there.

5657
02:24:00,351 --> 02:24:01,184
We ran away.

5658
02:24:01,670 --> 02:24:02,503
Deal for him.

5659
02:24:02,930 --> 02:24:04,910
Remember when you started
doing that and it worked?

5660
02:24:05,510 --> 02:24:06,141
Long legs.

5661
02:24:06,141 --> 02:24:06,651
Look at this shit.

5662
02:24:06,651 --> 02:24:07,910
Look at this long arms fuck.

5663
02:24:08,230 --> 02:24:10,590
Who was the one dude that Nate quarry Fox.

5664
02:24:10,730 --> 02:24:12,620
There was literally running away from him.

5665
02:24:12,621 --> 02:24:13,300
Caleb stone.

5666
02:24:13,300 --> 02:24:13,970
Caleb Lipstein.

5667
02:24:13,970 --> 02:24:14,720
That's right.

5668
02:24:14,720 --> 02:24:15,890
And Nate Quarry was,

5669
02:24:15,980 --> 02:24:17,480
was Cohen after him like this.

5670
02:24:18,050 --> 02:24:19,100
But I think he goes,

5671
02:24:19,910 --> 02:24:20,090
no,

5672
02:24:20,090 --> 02:24:20,841
he covered his eyes.

5673
02:24:20,841 --> 02:24:21,280
Yeah,

5674
02:24:21,280 --> 02:24:22,190
but it wasn't hurting that fight.

5675
02:24:22,470 --> 02:24:24,710
He wasn't hurt his foot.

5676
02:24:25,870 --> 02:24:27,530
He fucked his foot up running.

5677
02:24:27,650 --> 02:24:29,090
That was a terrible fight.

5678
02:24:29,390 --> 02:24:30,223
Wasn't good.

5679
02:24:30,860 --> 02:24:32,150
It ruined Caleb's career.

5680
02:24:32,570 --> 02:24:33,260
Yeah.

5681
02:24:33,260 --> 02:24:34,093
People were so

5682
02:24:35,790 --> 02:24:36,623
shocked him.

5683
02:24:37,070 --> 02:24:37,760
He poked him.

5684
02:24:37,760 --> 02:24:38,600
Jesus Christ.

5685
02:24:39,050 --> 02:24:39,171
Well,

5686
02:24:39,171 --> 02:24:42,380
I guess if he put his hand down down
first and he hit him with the upper cut,

5687
02:24:42,420 --> 02:24:43,253
goddammit.

5688
02:24:44,260 --> 02:24:46,970
He poked him first and then
we'll see in the replay.

5689
02:24:46,971 --> 02:24:47,804
What happened.

5690
02:24:47,990 --> 02:24:48,823
Shit,

5691
02:24:48,950 --> 02:24:50,090
if this is in New York,

5692
02:24:50,120 --> 02:24:50,540
Oh,

5693
02:24:50,540 --> 02:24:51,770
Glover wins the fight.

5694
02:24:51,950 --> 02:24:52,490
No,

5695
02:24:52,490 --> 02:24:53,360
no contest.

5696
02:24:53,780 --> 02:24:54,770
Fuck.

5697
02:24:55,510 --> 02:24:58,660
This is the worst part of
fighting as he's got damn iPad.

5698
02:24:58,910 --> 02:24:59,920
Glover's finds some.

5699
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:00,833
All right.

5700
02:25:01,370 --> 02:25:02,203
Oh yeah.

5701
02:25:02,760 --> 02:25:03,320
Oh,

5702
02:25:03,320 --> 02:25:04,340
he's lucky that I missed.

5703
02:25:04,341 --> 02:25:04,920
I missed.

5704
02:25:04,920 --> 02:25:05,753
Yeah,

5705
02:25:06,500 --> 02:25:07,333
yeah,

5706
02:25:08,090 --> 02:25:08,923
yeah.

5707
02:25:10,120 --> 02:25:11,010
Let's see if they can get a bit.

5708
02:25:11,050 --> 02:25:12,040
Oh Man,

5709
02:25:12,041 --> 02:25:13,450
look at that right in there.

5710
02:25:13,690 --> 02:25:14,530
That's the worst.

5711
02:25:15,010 --> 02:25:15,960
But that's the other eye.

5712
02:25:17,270 --> 02:25:17,630
Is He?

5713
02:25:17,630 --> 02:25:17,880
Oh,

5714
02:25:17,880 --> 02:25:18,830
his right eye or hours left.

5715
02:25:19,150 --> 02:25:20,050
Both eyes.

5716
02:25:20,160 --> 02:25:21,570
Do you get poked him both times?

5717
02:25:22,840 --> 02:25:23,880
He that a bitch.

5718
02:25:24,590 --> 02:25:24,700
Well,

5719
02:25:24,700 --> 02:25:26,440
maybe he's like squinting
with his left leg was saying,

5720
02:25:26,441 --> 02:25:27,041
I'm going to fight.

5721
02:25:27,041 --> 02:25:27,550
Get out of the way.

5722
02:25:27,550 --> 02:25:28,390
That's what you want.

5723
02:25:28,391 --> 02:25:29,440
Some of those young guys be like,

5724
02:25:29,470 --> 02:25:30,101
I don't know.

5725
02:25:30,101 --> 02:25:31,810
It's tough globally to get
the fuck out of my way.

5726
02:25:31,960 --> 02:25:34,090
The old eye gouge for a street fighting.

5727
02:25:34,460 --> 02:25:35,950
Most Kung Fu guys are onto something.

5728
02:25:36,150 --> 02:25:36,530
Oh,

5729
02:25:36,530 --> 02:25:37,370
they were on something.

5730
02:25:37,380 --> 02:25:38,213
Eagle Claw,

5731
02:25:39,020 --> 02:25:39,370
tiger,

5732
02:25:39,370 --> 02:25:40,120
Paul,

5733
02:25:40,120 --> 02:25:40,953
Tiger and Eagle.

5734
02:25:41,740 --> 02:25:42,430
I use both.

5735
02:25:42,430 --> 02:25:45,700
Brians did you see that video where
that Tai-chi guy fights the MMA guy?

5736
02:25:46,340 --> 02:25:47,050
I did not.

5737
02:25:47,050 --> 02:25:47,710
It's uh,

5738
02:25:47,710 --> 02:25:49,180
it lasted like a few sac.

5739
02:25:49,181 --> 02:25:50,230
Did you send me that Joe?

5740
02:25:50,280 --> 02:25:50,660
Yeah.

5741
02:25:50,660 --> 02:25:50,990
Like yeah,

5742
02:25:50,990 --> 02:25:54,250
tell him I may got crushed with them
and then the MMA guy I had to go into

5743
02:25:54,251 --> 02:25:58,720
hiding because apparently people in China
want to kill him because it's like a

5744
02:25:58,721 --> 02:26:00,980
disgrace to the Chinese martial arts.

5745
02:26:00,981 --> 02:26:01,990
So it's not a march.

5746
02:26:01,991 --> 02:26:03,970
It's not part of that right
hand be it's their fault.

5747
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:05,200
Oh,

5748
02:26:05,720 --> 02:26:07,330
that's a beautiful upper cut.

5749
02:26:08,060 --> 02:26:09,850
So long you get out too.

5750
02:26:09,851 --> 02:26:11,140
It's a nice open man.

5751
02:26:12,110 --> 02:26:12,620
Yeah.

5752
02:26:12,620 --> 02:26:14,570
Gustafson looking slick dude.

5753
02:26:14,571 --> 02:26:16,730
I'm really champ.

5754
02:26:16,731 --> 02:26:17,331
Him and John,

5755
02:26:17,331 --> 02:26:17,541
man,

5756
02:26:17,541 --> 02:26:18,680
that's the fucking fight.

5757
02:26:18,860 --> 02:26:19,693
It might be

5758
02:26:20,660 --> 02:26:21,201
Muy Bien.

5759
02:26:21,201 --> 02:26:22,940
Well now that rumbles out of the picture,

5760
02:26:22,941 --> 02:26:23,571
I mean Gustafson,

5761
02:26:23,571 --> 02:26:24,051
you got to remember,

5762
02:26:24,051 --> 02:26:26,930
did rock out Jimmy marijuana
as a right hand over the top.

5763
02:26:27,080 --> 02:26:28,220
I wonder how they handle that now.

5764
02:26:28,221 --> 02:26:29,180
They've been training together.

5765
02:26:29,181 --> 02:26:31,180
You know Gus Gus January beat Manoa.

5766
02:26:31,220 --> 02:26:31,401
Yeah,

5767
02:26:31,401 --> 02:26:31,941
he knocked him out.

5768
02:26:31,941 --> 02:26:34,880
But I wonder how they handled that
because if man was still in the mix,

5769
02:26:34,910 --> 02:26:37,160
if they do eventually
have to cross paths again,

5770
02:26:37,340 --> 02:26:38,390
I'm not trying to see that again.

5771
02:26:38,500 --> 02:26:38,730
Well,

5772
02:26:38,730 --> 02:26:41,990
it's so thin and they have to,

5773
02:26:42,020 --> 02:26:43,010
they have to fight again.

5774
02:26:43,040 --> 02:26:45,620
It's almost like flyweight
like who the fuck is there?

5775
02:26:45,650 --> 02:26:45,891
No,

5776
02:26:45,891 --> 02:26:46,071
you,

5777
02:26:46,071 --> 02:26:49,460
you look at this running
away the stone and then stop.

5778
02:26:49,490 --> 02:26:49,631
Oh,

5779
02:26:49,631 --> 02:26:52,500
he clipped him with that opera cut
again again with the upper cut,

5780
02:26:53,060 --> 02:26:53,570
left hook.

5781
02:26:53,570 --> 02:26:55,010
Get out of there and then he'd go,

5782
02:26:56,250 --> 02:26:57,440
I'm not mad at this tactic.

5783
02:26:57,470 --> 02:27:00,670
Clover swinging for
the fences to backache.

5784
02:27:00,730 --> 02:27:02,450
We've got five rounds of this boys.

5785
02:27:02,510 --> 02:27:03,560
I love this fight,

5786
02:27:03,561 --> 02:27:04,310
man.

5787
02:27:04,310 --> 02:27:05,480
Dustbin John Too.

5788
02:27:05,500 --> 02:27:06,333
Are you kidding me?

5789
02:27:06,740 --> 02:27:08,360
I'd love to see Gus and John Too.

5790
02:27:09,200 --> 02:27:09,980
I don't know what I'm saying.

5791
02:27:09,980 --> 02:27:11,780
Dumb shit that everybody listen again.

5792
02:27:11,781 --> 02:27:12,720
Cost of sin.

5793
02:27:12,890 --> 02:27:13,880
30 years old.

5794
02:27:14,300 --> 02:27:15,410
He's still young man.

5795
02:27:15,440 --> 02:27:16,910
A lot of fight left Joe.

5796
02:27:16,980 --> 02:27:18,800
You know he's had a lot
of fights too though.

5797
02:27:20,120 --> 02:27:20,391
Yeah,

5798
02:27:20,391 --> 02:27:21,820
he has had some wars too.

5799
02:27:21,960 --> 02:27:22,793
Yeah.

5800
02:27:23,120 --> 02:27:23,930
John is fight.

5801
02:27:23,930 --> 02:27:25,130
DC was award.

5802
02:27:25,131 --> 02:27:26,780
John was a fucking war.

5803
02:27:26,870 --> 02:27:28,310
And you've got a beating from rumble.

5804
02:27:30,700 --> 02:27:31,533
Yeah.

5805
02:27:32,330 --> 02:27:32,800
Other than that,

5806
02:27:32,800 --> 02:27:33,670
it's kind of Ooh,

5807
02:27:34,200 --> 02:27:35,560
fakes the take down.

5808
02:27:37,580 --> 02:27:38,870
This is an interesting fight.

5809
02:27:38,900 --> 02:27:39,591
The way it's playing out.

5810
02:27:39,591 --> 02:27:40,850
Glover's chasing them down,

5811
02:27:40,851 --> 02:27:41,620
man.

5812
02:27:41,620 --> 02:27:42,980
I hope he can get them pinned.

5813
02:27:43,010 --> 02:27:46,140
It's got to get inside of
that reading comprehension.

5814
02:27:46,840 --> 02:27:49,580
Not Wonder if blowers going to
time that with an overhand right.

5815
02:27:49,910 --> 02:27:50,750
He's got to try,

5816
02:27:50,960 --> 02:27:52,200
but you got to remember his right hands.

5817
02:27:52,220 --> 02:27:53,150
The one that's fucked up,

5818
02:27:53,780 --> 02:27:54,740
his shoulder and his right.

5819
02:27:54,770 --> 02:27:56,230
It's a fucked up kid up.

5820
02:27:57,070 --> 02:27:57,960
I get a [inaudible].

5821
02:27:58,070 --> 02:27:58,920
I love this scope.

5822
02:27:59,020 --> 02:27:59,470
Scope.

5823
02:27:59,470 --> 02:28:00,360
Best you want me to help you out?

5824
02:28:00,830 --> 02:28:01,940
I out of your giant.

5825
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:02,833
Should I secure?

5826
02:28:03,480 --> 02:28:05,480
How about this fucking Golden State?

5827
02:28:05,660 --> 02:28:06,493
Cavs

5828
02:28:08,300 --> 02:28:08,950
basketball aren't.

5829
02:28:08,950 --> 02:28:09,160
Yeah,

5830
02:28:09,160 --> 02:28:09,993
I'll throw up.

5831
02:28:11,570 --> 02:28:12,620
Throw up on this table.

5832
02:28:12,680 --> 02:28:13,700
I will watch that basketball.

5833
02:28:14,630 --> 02:28:15,351
Fuck you guys.

5834
02:28:15,351 --> 02:28:18,410
It goes in the net and I get so
excited and haven't got pissed buddy.

5835
02:28:18,530 --> 02:28:21,890
It's crazy when the ball goes in
and that I've never seen like it.

5836
02:28:23,690 --> 02:28:24,523
Jamie gets mad.

5837
02:28:24,630 --> 02:28:25,030
Well,

5838
02:28:25,030 --> 02:28:25,863
it's not what it's about.

5839
02:28:26,210 --> 02:28:28,670
It's part of the things
but more important things.

5840
02:28:28,671 --> 02:28:29,570
Both athletics.

5841
02:28:29,750 --> 02:28:31,670
It's both the best of the
best players in the world.

5842
02:28:31,671 --> 02:28:31,911
Coach,

5843
02:28:31,911 --> 02:28:33,290
you know which one it for coaching.

5844
02:28:33,350 --> 02:28:34,370
It is a great sport,

5845
02:28:34,371 --> 02:28:34,880
but you know,

5846
02:28:34,880 --> 02:28:35,840
you know which they're making

5847
02:28:38,750 --> 02:28:39,583
Jamie oppression.

5848
02:28:39,590 --> 02:28:43,420
I make fun of a Jamie's a sneakers
and he makes fun of underarmour suite.

5849
02:28:43,430 --> 02:28:46,220
You weren't under Armour like so
what's wrong with under Armour?

5850
02:28:46,430 --> 02:28:51,430
Like in the world of like sneaker sneaker
dorks is under Armour like shots got

5851
02:28:52,491 --> 02:28:54,980
200 pairs of sneakers and clothes.

5852
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:55,460
Yeah.

5853
02:28:55,460 --> 02:28:56,270
What's it like?

5854
02:28:56,270 --> 02:28:59,540
That's like number four or
five in the list of hierarchy.

5855
02:28:59,940 --> 02:29:01,520
Same Dog trainer Ryan.

5856
02:29:01,610 --> 02:29:02,120
Yeah.

5857
02:29:02,120 --> 02:29:02,953
Yeah.

5858
02:29:02,960 --> 02:29:03,793
We'll talk.

5859
02:29:03,950 --> 02:29:04,783
Yup.

5860
02:29:05,850 --> 02:29:06,683
Here we go.

5861
02:29:06,840 --> 02:29:09,660
Round dose to two two,

5862
02:29:09,780 --> 02:29:14,780
two was that Double Jab at Gustafson.

5863
02:29:19,140 --> 02:29:20,310
Very interesting fight.

5864
02:29:20,440 --> 02:29:21,273
Oh,

5865
02:29:23,350 --> 02:29:24,183
how's your dog?

5866
02:29:24,880 --> 02:29:25,713
Great.

5867
02:29:26,030 --> 02:29:26,860
What?

5868
02:29:26,860 --> 02:29:27,710
You got a German shepherd?

5869
02:29:27,760 --> 02:29:29,650
I had a German shepherd girl or boy Carl.

5870
02:29:30,690 --> 02:29:32,440
Is she cool with your kids the best?

5871
02:29:32,441 --> 02:29:34,210
I'll never have another dog
besides the German shepherd.

5872
02:29:34,730 --> 02:29:35,020
Yup.

5873
02:29:35,020 --> 02:29:36,010
My working line chapter,

5874
02:29:36,020 --> 02:29:36,401
there's nothing.

5875
02:29:36,401 --> 02:29:37,510
I've had dogs my whole life.

5876
02:29:37,810 --> 02:29:37,961
I,

5877
02:29:37,961 --> 02:29:39,100
they're just different animals.

5878
02:29:39,490 --> 02:29:40,450
They're so keyed in to you.

5879
02:29:40,451 --> 02:29:42,790
They listen to you and
they're wary of strangers.

5880
02:29:42,791 --> 02:29:43,061
Man.

5881
02:29:43,061 --> 02:29:43,930
They don't fuck around.

5882
02:29:44,590 --> 02:29:45,610
Amazing washe talks,

5883
02:29:45,611 --> 02:29:46,421
but they can dissent.

5884
02:29:46,421 --> 02:29:48,070
They can not dog aggressive.

5885
02:29:48,450 --> 02:29:48,750
Uh,

5886
02:29:48,750 --> 02:29:49,750
they stay with you.

5887
02:29:49,780 --> 02:29:50,613
That the best.

5888
02:29:50,740 --> 02:29:51,573
I love him.

5889
02:29:52,230 --> 02:29:53,290
Mr Shop's going to get one.

5890
02:29:53,350 --> 02:29:57,430
I love German shepherds to what I don't
like is ones that don't get trained well

5891
02:29:57,431 --> 02:29:57,911
and they bite.

5892
02:29:57,911 --> 02:29:59,140
Kids know that you don't,

5893
02:29:59,160 --> 02:30:02,530
that's that's why you get a job
with [inaudible] talking about dogs.

5894
02:30:03,090 --> 02:30:06,240
Malibu Malinois Malinois
Belgian malinois today.

5895
02:30:06,270 --> 02:30:06,790
Today,

5896
02:30:06,790 --> 02:30:07,660
train today.

5897
02:30:07,810 --> 02:30:09,670
Whenever I'll let you know.

5898
02:30:09,730 --> 02:30:11,980
A lot of people don't like
Belgium Mel walls cause they're,

5899
02:30:11,981 --> 02:30:13,690
they're almost a little too gay are,

5900
02:30:13,691 --> 02:30:14,260
but he's got a,

5901
02:30:14,260 --> 02:30:15,130
he's got a special one.

5902
02:30:15,130 --> 02:30:16,720
This one I saw the picture he sent me.

5903
02:30:17,090 --> 02:30:17,860
He saw that picture.

5904
02:30:17,860 --> 02:30:19,000
Just things going to this thing.

5905
02:30:19,001 --> 02:30:20,500
We'll inhale and intruder.

5906
02:30:20,830 --> 02:30:21,041
Yeah.

5907
02:30:21,041 --> 02:30:22,360
Those mother fuckers don't play.

5908
02:30:23,300 --> 02:30:24,190
They cut again.

5909
02:30:24,400 --> 02:30:24,671
Pop.

5910
02:30:24,671 --> 02:30:25,504
Pop.

5911
02:30:25,830 --> 02:30:26,481
What caught his eye?

5912
02:30:26,481 --> 02:30:26,870
What happened?

5913
02:30:26,870 --> 02:30:27,270
Headbutting.

5914
02:30:27,270 --> 02:30:27,720
I don't know.

5915
02:30:27,720 --> 02:30:27,951
Yeah,

5916
02:30:27,951 --> 02:30:29,080
but guts since plan.

5917
02:30:29,081 --> 02:30:29,680
Now look at us.

5918
02:30:29,680 --> 02:30:30,190
Look at us.

5919
02:30:30,190 --> 02:30:30,640
Look at us.

5920
02:30:30,640 --> 02:30:32,200
Brian was talking about working dogs.

5921
02:30:33,430 --> 02:30:34,640
I'm obsessed with uh,

5922
02:30:34,880 --> 02:30:37,360
to give him that he does.

5923
02:30:37,980 --> 02:30:38,561
He'll too.

5924
02:30:38,561 --> 02:30:41,560
And Dogs B C here in the dog
and the guns you into fighting.

5925
02:30:41,620 --> 02:30:43,130
I ain't talk about cars and turn up.

5926
02:30:43,850 --> 02:30:44,683
What's up.

5927
02:30:45,040 --> 02:30:46,270
I only have so much in my brain,

5928
02:30:46,271 --> 02:30:46,601
brothers.

5929
02:30:46,601 --> 02:30:47,231
You know what it is,

5930
02:30:47,231 --> 02:30:47,501
man.

5931
02:30:47,501 --> 02:30:48,970
You've never driven one probably.

5932
02:30:49,090 --> 02:30:49,690
Yeah.

5933
02:30:49,690 --> 02:30:50,501
That's all I need though,

5934
02:30:50,501 --> 02:30:51,334
right?

5935
02:30:51,340 --> 02:30:52,450
Oh,

5936
02:30:52,690 --> 02:30:53,321
careful with that.

5937
02:30:53,321 --> 02:30:54,340
Runaway clothes.

5938
02:30:54,460 --> 02:30:57,340
I'd rather him time up and fucking
gloves and get punched in the face.

5939
02:30:57,341 --> 02:31:00,400
He's bleeding bad out of that and there
was getting picked apart in the middle

5940
02:31:00,401 --> 02:31:01,140
of the octagon.

5941
02:31:01,140 --> 02:31:01,973
Yeah,

5942
02:31:02,470 --> 02:31:03,303
it's fucking,

5943
02:31:04,300 --> 02:31:05,890
oh,

5944
02:31:06,330 --> 02:31:07,163
Gotcha,

5945
02:31:07,950 --> 02:31:08,783
Gotcha.

5946
02:31:11,710 --> 02:31:12,071
Oh,

5947
02:31:12,071 --> 02:31:13,060
glow was in trouble.

5948
02:31:13,090 --> 02:31:14,200
Big trouble.

5949
02:31:14,500 --> 02:31:15,980
When's the last time I saw that?

5950
02:31:17,050 --> 02:31:18,370
My Cart Tyrone Woodley.

5951
02:31:18,380 --> 02:31:19,110
Stop Horse.

5952
02:31:19,110 --> 02:31:19,740
Oh boy.

5953
02:31:19,740 --> 02:31:20,070
Wow.

5954
02:31:20,070 --> 02:31:20,903
What a combination.

5955
02:31:20,910 --> 02:31:23,200
Spinning elbow kid.

5956
02:31:23,760 --> 02:31:24,780
I seen that on dummies.

5957
02:31:25,560 --> 02:31:27,330
Gustafson coming alive.

5958
02:31:27,360 --> 02:31:30,030
Gfsi centers tell any man
that real fuss like the hill.

5959
02:31:30,960 --> 02:31:32,610
Chava sang it a long time ago.

5960
02:31:32,750 --> 02:31:33,421
She gets back.

5961
02:31:33,421 --> 02:31:34,230
I'll give him that.

5962
02:31:34,230 --> 02:31:36,420
The one thing he's right
about with fighting was Gus,

5963
02:31:36,680 --> 02:31:37,800
look at his face.

5964
02:31:38,040 --> 02:31:39,750
Clovers faces a mask.

5965
02:31:40,290 --> 02:31:41,520
It's a mess right now,

5966
02:31:41,880 --> 02:31:42,601
but again,

5967
02:31:42,601 --> 02:31:43,180
close that guy.

5968
02:31:43,180 --> 02:31:44,550
He has so much knock out power.

5969
02:31:44,551 --> 02:31:45,510
It's like one shot.

5970
02:31:45,540 --> 02:31:45,721
Oh,

5971
02:31:45,721 --> 02:31:46,800
great body shot.

5972
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:47,390
Yeah.

5973
02:31:47,390 --> 02:31:48,223
Very good.

5974
02:31:48,970 --> 02:31:50,460
Causes us to be an issue for him.

5975
02:31:51,090 --> 02:31:52,350
Maybe I remember the book.

5976
02:31:52,360 --> 02:31:55,860
He knows you trained with gfes
and you spar with both these guys.

5977
02:31:55,861 --> 02:31:56,694
Yeah,

5978
02:31:57,180 --> 02:31:59,880
I remember you saying that way
before you like he's the real deal.

5979
02:32:00,710 --> 02:32:01,050
Uh,

5980
02:32:01,050 --> 02:32:02,460
best I've ever trained with hands down.

5981
02:32:02,820 --> 02:32:03,653
Gustafson's yes.

5982
02:32:03,780 --> 02:32:04,613
By far.

5983
02:32:04,740 --> 02:32:05,880
Biggest freak I've ever seen.

5984
02:32:06,350 --> 02:32:07,111
I can't believe it,

5985
02:32:07,111 --> 02:32:07,830
man.

5986
02:32:07,830 --> 02:32:08,520
He,

5987
02:32:08,520 --> 02:32:10,100
he was so good at everything,

5988
02:32:10,440 --> 02:32:10,710
you know,

5989
02:32:10,710 --> 02:32:11,161
outside of new,

5990
02:32:11,161 --> 02:32:12,240
he was really good.

5991
02:32:12,470 --> 02:32:12,810
Uh,

5992
02:32:12,810 --> 02:32:13,650
his size.

5993
02:32:13,651 --> 02:32:14,820
I watched him spar with a,

5994
02:32:15,060 --> 02:32:15,271
you know,

5995
02:32:15,271 --> 02:32:17,220
a world champion boxer.

5996
02:32:17,260 --> 02:32:20,880
It literally eight rounds
and just do work on the dude,

5997
02:32:20,881 --> 02:32:23,600
straight up boxing world champion
who was the world champion.

5998
02:32:23,610 --> 02:32:24,450
Forget the guy's name.

5999
02:32:24,451 --> 02:32:26,120
You know how many belts are if some guy,

6000
02:32:26,510 --> 02:32:27,030
you know,

6001
02:32:27,030 --> 02:32:27,301
but he,

6002
02:32:27,301 --> 02:32:27,501
he,

6003
02:32:27,501 --> 02:32:28,530
he literally went in there,

6004
02:32:28,540 --> 02:32:29,001
did work,

6005
02:32:29,001 --> 02:32:29,431
gets him that,

6006
02:32:29,431 --> 02:32:29,911
jumped out,

6007
02:32:29,911 --> 02:32:30,810
went three rounds with me.

6008
02:32:30,920 --> 02:32:31,560
It was,

6009
02:32:31,560 --> 02:32:32,393
I was,

6010
02:32:32,570 --> 02:32:33,150
I mean,

6011
02:32:33,150 --> 02:32:33,481
wow.

6012
02:32:33,481 --> 02:32:35,220
So sparring with them,

6013
02:32:35,221 --> 02:32:36,430
just botched it up box.

6014
02:32:36,431 --> 02:32:36,930
Oh Shit.

6015
02:32:36,930 --> 02:32:38,100
And fucking I'm up.

6016
02:32:38,140 --> 02:32:40,170
Got when you were to share
is still in this fight guys.

6017
02:32:40,171 --> 02:32:41,760
He was straight up box
in the streams going,

6018
02:32:41,790 --> 02:32:42,660
don't knock them out,

6019
02:32:42,670 --> 02:32:43,050
Alexander.

6020
02:32:43,050 --> 02:32:44,220
Do not knock them out.

6021
02:32:44,550 --> 02:32:45,150
Wow.

6022
02:32:45,150 --> 02:32:45,600
Yeah,

6023
02:32:45,600 --> 02:32:46,170
it was crazy.

6024
02:32:46,170 --> 02:32:48,780
I wonder if Alexander ever thought
about actually just boxing.

6025
02:32:49,170 --> 02:32:50,003
I don't know.

6026
02:32:50,370 --> 02:32:51,810
Nice front kick to the side of that.

6027
02:32:51,900 --> 02:32:52,733
Oh Jesus.

6028
02:32:52,910 --> 02:32:56,890
But the left over is doing work,

6029
02:32:57,010 --> 02:32:58,950
but you look at his fight
with Jon Jones fight.

6030
02:32:59,010 --> 02:32:59,251
To me,

6031
02:32:59,251 --> 02:33:01,830
that's the greatest light
heavyweight fight of all time.

6032
02:33:02,130 --> 02:33:04,470
I was fucking so thrilled with that fight,

6033
02:33:04,471 --> 02:33:04,770
man.

6034
02:33:04,770 --> 02:33:05,221
Amazing.

6035
02:33:05,221 --> 02:33:07,380
Because there's finally John
John's kind of met his match.

6036
02:33:07,530 --> 02:33:10,200
Granted John Probably had two hours of
sleep and do a bunch of lines of coke,

6037
02:33:10,201 --> 02:33:11,034
so who knows now,

6038
02:33:11,280 --> 02:33:13,130
but still at the time it was great.

6039
02:33:13,230 --> 02:33:16,050
I don't like this funding away because
clover's going to time this shit man.

6040
02:33:16,500 --> 02:33:17,070
You think?

6041
02:33:17,070 --> 02:33:19,590
I think so and worries me
all your years of fighting.

6042
02:33:19,591 --> 02:33:20,580
Have you ever seen that happen?

6043
02:33:21,120 --> 02:33:21,953
Yes.

6044
02:33:21,980 --> 02:33:23,220
I'm Mr. O'Brien

6045
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:25,950
when Mr over and

6046
02:33:27,840 --> 02:33:28,591
I don't teach my,

6047
02:33:28,591 --> 02:33:31,410
I don't teach my students
to do all the time.

6048
02:33:31,420 --> 02:33:33,750
So let me ask you guys this
while we're watching the fight,

6049
02:33:33,780 --> 02:33:36,600
what's the best set up
to do a fight companion?

6050
02:33:36,600 --> 02:33:40,380
Because I'm building a fight
companions studio in the next place.

6051
02:33:40,410 --> 02:33:44,220
I feel like chef punching bags that we
can hit out of frustration or anxiety.

6052
02:33:44,240 --> 02:33:44,350
Well,

6053
02:33:44,350 --> 02:33:48,810
what I'm thinking is the way we're
sitting here across from each other and

6054
02:33:48,811 --> 02:33:51,300
watching the fights is not totally ideal.

6055
02:33:51,480 --> 02:33:52,860
I'm thinking round table.

6056
02:33:53,220 --> 02:33:54,720
More like a semi circle.

6057
02:33:54,721 --> 02:33:55,590
Like a half moon.

6058
02:33:55,810 --> 02:33:56,643
That's cool.

6059
02:33:56,700 --> 02:33:56,970
Yeah.

6060
02:33:56,970 --> 02:33:58,320
Almost like an analyst desk.

6061
02:33:58,380 --> 02:33:58,921
Yeah.

6062
02:33:58,921 --> 02:34:00,510
And then the t v there.

6063
02:34:00,630 --> 02:34:02,300
But this way we're all be like,

6064
02:34:02,400 --> 02:34:02,510
oh,

6065
02:34:02,510 --> 02:34:03,343
that's cool.

6066
02:34:03,890 --> 02:34:04,670
That's what I've been thinking.

6067
02:34:04,670 --> 02:34:05,503
A great idea.

6068
02:34:06,210 --> 02:34:07,380
But we should have a desk,

6069
02:34:07,381 --> 02:34:07,591
right?

6070
02:34:07,591 --> 02:34:10,110
It's good to have a desk and
drink some shirts and stuff.

6071
02:34:11,370 --> 02:34:15,090
So I'm going to set up a second thing
just in front of a big ass TV and I'm

6072
02:34:15,091 --> 02:34:17,980
thinking of putting a big ass TV like even

6073
02:34:17,980 --> 02:34:18,731
bigger than this month.

6074
02:34:18,731 --> 02:34:19,870
I can protect that idea.

6075
02:34:19,940 --> 02:34:20,121
No,

6076
02:34:20,121 --> 02:34:20,231
no,

6077
02:34:20,231 --> 02:34:20,471
no,

6078
02:34:20,471 --> 02:34:20,591
no,

6079
02:34:20,591 --> 02:34:20,741
no.

6080
02:34:20,741 --> 02:34:22,720
Like 110 inch LCD.

6081
02:34:23,010 --> 02:34:23,843
Bam.

6082
02:34:24,560 --> 02:34:25,540
Look at this Combo.

6083
02:34:25,541 --> 02:34:26,201
Beautiful.

6084
02:34:26,201 --> 02:34:27,160
It could also be,

6085
02:34:27,190 --> 02:34:28,540
we can ask a big couch.

6086
02:34:28,541 --> 02:34:29,040
I want him.

6087
02:34:29,040 --> 02:34:30,100
Would that make us too tired?

6088
02:34:30,240 --> 02:34:31,870
That's what I think.

6089
02:34:31,871 --> 02:34:33,760
These chairs are the shit,

6090
02:34:34,300 --> 02:34:34,961
these chairs,

6091
02:34:34,961 --> 02:34:35,261
these,

6092
02:34:35,261 --> 02:34:35,650
uh,

6093
02:34:35,650 --> 02:34:37,140
these are people keep asking.

6094
02:34:37,160 --> 02:34:38,410
I'll tell there's not a sponsor.

6095
02:34:38,411 --> 02:34:39,880
Ergo depot sent me these.

6096
02:34:39,881 --> 02:34:41,030
They're from there.

6097
02:34:41,110 --> 02:34:42,790
They're called capisce goes in.

6098
02:34:42,791 --> 02:34:44,530
There are Ergonomic Tommy buttons.

6099
02:34:44,531 --> 02:34:46,790
It has these now Thompson or
has these in his podcasts.

6100
02:34:47,450 --> 02:34:48,283
Ergo what?

6101
02:34:48,470 --> 02:34:50,330
Depo chairs at our second,

6102
02:34:50,380 --> 02:34:52,600
e r g o t depot.com.

6103
02:34:52,870 --> 02:34:55,900
And these fucking chairs are
excellent because they're comfortable,

6104
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:57,450
but they're also ergonomics.

6105
02:34:57,451 --> 02:35:01,090
So like you sit up straight because you
sit up straight after the end of the

6106
02:35:01,091 --> 02:35:01,301
show.

6107
02:35:01,301 --> 02:35:05,140
Your back doesn't fucking matter at all
because you don't do a couch for the no,

6108
02:35:05,160 --> 02:35:05,800
no couches.

6109
02:35:05,800 --> 02:35:08,200
I think where these chairs
are it for podcasts.

6110
02:35:08,201 --> 02:35:11,380
I think I found the holy
grail of podcast chairs.

6111
02:35:11,460 --> 02:35:11,770
Great.

6112
02:35:11,770 --> 02:35:12,603
They're amazing.

6113
02:35:12,640 --> 02:35:13,031
The question.

6114
02:35:13,031 --> 02:35:16,570
So the question was what kind of set up
she would have like side tables and I

6115
02:35:16,571 --> 02:35:16,751
think,

6116
02:35:16,751 --> 02:35:17,021
no,

6117
02:35:17,021 --> 02:35:17,854
I think,

6118
02:35:17,860 --> 02:35:19,980
I think a table in front
of us is the way I sent,

6119
02:35:20,270 --> 02:35:22,900
because Brian's always bringing
wine and cheese and shit.

6120
02:35:22,940 --> 02:35:23,620
Yup.

6121
02:35:23,620 --> 02:35:23,801
Yeah.

6122
02:35:23,801 --> 02:35:27,220
We're always going to want to slide
things down to each other and this stuff.

6123
02:35:27,250 --> 02:35:28,900
Then you should have
like give just a area.

6124
02:35:29,040 --> 02:35:29,770
It looks like a,

6125
02:35:29,770 --> 02:35:29,930
uh,

6126
02:35:29,930 --> 02:35:31,540
like an old school telephone booth.

6127
02:35:31,550 --> 02:35:33,310
It's called conspiracy theories.

6128
02:35:33,340 --> 02:35:34,960
And then fucking Eddie goes in there.

6129
02:35:35,050 --> 02:35:40,050
Now what I'm going to have is a second
thing with experts on Skype on standby

6130
02:35:40,630 --> 02:35:41,463
waiting.

6131
02:35:41,590 --> 02:35:43,120
Every time Eddie says something crazy,

6132
02:35:43,121 --> 02:35:45,310
I'm going to press a button and boom,

6133
02:35:45,340 --> 02:35:46,240
Neil degrasse Tyson,

6134
02:35:46,241 --> 02:35:47,074
you're on the line.

6135
02:35:48,280 --> 02:35:49,420
Do you know what I think we should have?

6136
02:35:49,560 --> 02:35:51,940
Should have a grill and
somebody should be cooking.

6137
02:35:52,010 --> 02:35:52,843
Oh,

6138
02:35:53,590 --> 02:35:54,423
oh.

6139
02:35:54,550 --> 02:35:55,390
Oh my God.

6140
02:35:56,560 --> 02:35:57,393
Oh my God.

6141
02:35:57,880 --> 02:35:58,390
Marius.

6142
02:35:58,390 --> 02:35:58,841
Trouble.

6143
02:35:58,841 --> 02:36:01,750
Serious trouble letting my brain no,

6144
02:36:01,751 --> 02:36:01,961
no,

6145
02:36:01,961 --> 02:36:02,231
no.

6146
02:36:02,231 --> 02:36:04,500
But is in some serious trouble here man.

6147
02:36:04,510 --> 02:36:05,343
If you have to cover,

6148
02:36:05,550 --> 02:36:07,960
but she might or might get grounded out.

6149
02:36:09,880 --> 02:36:10,040
Well,

6150
02:36:10,040 --> 02:36:12,250
you got to posture up and he's clip.

6151
02:36:12,670 --> 02:36:13,810
Oh my God.

6152
02:36:14,880 --> 02:36:15,713
Oh my God.

6153
02:36:16,270 --> 02:36:20,020
I have a Bosch Yoder 1500,

6154
02:36:20,021 --> 02:36:23,590
which is a huge commercial
smoker for the studio.

6155
02:36:23,820 --> 02:36:24,760
You should have asked.

6156
02:36:24,850 --> 02:36:26,140
It should be a cooking show.

6157
02:36:26,320 --> 02:36:27,610
We should have somebody shoot.

6158
02:36:28,240 --> 02:36:28,901
I'm way ahead of you.

6159
02:36:28,901 --> 02:36:30,430
You've been listening to
my podcast or something?

6160
02:36:30,490 --> 02:36:30,850
No,

6161
02:36:30,850 --> 02:36:31,960
I'm doing cooking shows.

6162
02:36:31,990 --> 02:36:32,380
Thank you.

6163
02:36:32,380 --> 02:36:33,160
I'm going to do cook.

6164
02:36:33,160 --> 02:36:33,910
Oh,

6165
02:36:33,910 --> 02:36:35,270
the last one I did with Tom Papa.

6166
02:36:35,300 --> 02:36:35,921
We talked about it.

6167
02:36:35,921 --> 02:36:37,420
We're going to sit down and eat dinner.

6168
02:36:37,660 --> 02:36:38,830
I'm going to cook it on the show,

6169
02:36:38,860 --> 02:36:39,250
right?

6170
02:36:39,250 --> 02:36:42,130
We're going to sit down and eat dinner
on the podcasts and you're gonna hear a

6171
02:36:42,131 --> 02:36:45,580
lot of that drives house
is going for the arm bar.

6172
02:36:46,060 --> 02:36:47,110
It will drive you nuts,

6173
02:36:47,111 --> 02:36:49,390
but you will know that
it's going to be happening.

6174
02:36:49,391 --> 02:36:50,660
So hopefully it won't drive you.

6175
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:51,430
It will be,

6176
02:36:51,430 --> 02:36:52,660
it'll be a fight companion.

6177
02:36:52,661 --> 02:36:53,710
So we'll be eating game.

6178
02:36:53,711 --> 02:36:54,501
We'll be eating man.

6179
02:36:54,501 --> 02:36:55,780
Meet shrinking.

6180
02:36:55,781 --> 02:36:56,250
Amazing.

6181
02:36:56,250 --> 02:36:58,810
Why don't be a party pooper,

6182
02:36:58,811 --> 02:36:59,140
Brendan?

6183
02:36:59,140 --> 02:36:59,381
Well,

6184
02:36:59,381 --> 02:37:02,420
what I'm thinking is we're not going
to do that during fight companion then

6185
02:37:02,440 --> 02:37:03,430
there's too much going on.

6186
02:37:03,450 --> 02:37:04,350
So no,

6187
02:37:04,630 --> 02:37:06,070
it's going to be like a show.

6188
02:37:06,071 --> 02:37:07,300
We sit down and have a meal.

6189
02:37:08,470 --> 02:37:08,711
You know,

6190
02:37:08,711 --> 02:37:10,240
you watch those Anthony Bourdain shows,

6191
02:37:10,241 --> 02:37:12,520
he's talking to some
fucking lady in Sardinia.

6192
02:37:12,521 --> 02:37:13,840
You don't even know what
the hell she's saying.

6193
02:37:13,841 --> 02:37:14,674
And it's interesting,

6194
02:37:14,870 --> 02:37:15,580
right?

6195
02:37:15,580 --> 02:37:16,130
You're like,

6196
02:37:16,130 --> 02:37:17,420
I love a good meal,

6197
02:37:17,750 --> 02:37:18,501
having a good meal,

6198
02:37:18,501 --> 02:37:21,380
and I'm going to bring guys like
Hank Shaw have them cooked for us.

6199
02:37:21,410 --> 02:37:21,651
Oh,

6200
02:37:21,651 --> 02:37:22,484
nice trip.

6201
02:37:22,810 --> 02:37:24,800
I love Hank Shaw,

6202
02:37:24,801 --> 02:37:27,590
who's a world class game chef.

6203
02:37:27,670 --> 02:37:27,950
Ooh.

6204
02:37:27,950 --> 02:37:28,590
And a hunter.

6205
02:37:28,590 --> 02:37:29,040
Really?

6206
02:37:29,040 --> 02:37:29,873
Yeah.

6207
02:37:30,050 --> 02:37:33,100
If you get like some hooter girls
to like refill our con stuff,

6208
02:37:33,101 --> 02:37:33,790
sir.

6209
02:37:33,790 --> 02:37:34,623
Sorry.

6210
02:37:34,780 --> 02:37:35,011
Oh,

6211
02:37:35,011 --> 02:37:35,844
I'm all,

6212
02:37:36,280 --> 02:37:36,750
oh,

6213
02:37:36,750 --> 02:37:38,500
you're back.

6214
02:37:38,720 --> 02:37:38,901
Well,

6215
02:37:38,901 --> 02:37:41,250
Brian's doing all the meat and cooking.

6216
02:37:41,270 --> 02:37:44,240
You're all about that and I want to get
a couple of smoke shows to fill up our

6217
02:37:44,241 --> 02:37:46,610
coffees and all of a sudden
I'm fucking solves it here.

6218
02:37:46,611 --> 02:37:47,590
They get good lane,

6219
02:37:47,600 --> 02:37:48,433
bro.

6220
02:37:49,460 --> 02:37:50,630
They're paid to be class time.

6221
02:37:50,650 --> 02:37:54,400
Ian brought his girlfriend over
by paid to shut the fuck out.

6222
02:37:54,950 --> 02:37:56,090
They don't get paid enough.

6223
02:37:56,091 --> 02:37:57,050
That's not even possible.

6224
02:37:57,080 --> 02:37:57,540
Feminist.

6225
02:37:57,540 --> 02:37:58,370
I'm offended.

6226
02:37:58,370 --> 02:37:59,270
You see wonder woman?

6227
02:37:59,340 --> 02:37:59,670
Oh,

6228
02:37:59,670 --> 02:38:00,580
when only seen it.

6229
02:38:00,710 --> 02:38:02,240
Women only get to see went to the,

6230
02:38:02,241 --> 02:38:04,340
I went to the screenings with just women.

6231
02:38:04,370 --> 02:38:04,910
I liked it.

6232
02:38:04,910 --> 02:38:05,361
I liked that.

6233
02:38:05,361 --> 02:38:07,760
I wanted to come here anyways,

6234
02:38:07,790 --> 02:38:09,860
let's get back these hooter
bitches that refill on coffee.

6235
02:38:11,070 --> 02:38:12,020
You guys hit or not,

6236
02:38:12,021 --> 02:38:12,290
man,

6237
02:38:12,290 --> 02:38:13,780
I want something to do with this.

6238
02:38:13,781 --> 02:38:14,091
Stay.

6239
02:38:14,091 --> 02:38:14,660
He chipped.

6240
02:38:14,660 --> 02:38:15,380
Peer pressure.

6241
02:38:15,380 --> 02:38:15,891
Peer pressure.

6242
02:38:15,891 --> 02:38:16,701
I guess I am now.

6243
02:38:16,701 --> 02:38:18,560
They just feed us like beef jerky.

6244
02:38:18,950 --> 02:38:20,300
Beef jerky feed it to you.

6245
02:38:20,301 --> 02:38:21,134
That's weird.

6246
02:38:21,200 --> 02:38:22,190
Something wrong with your hands,

6247
02:38:23,660 --> 02:38:27,110
but I'm definitely had to bring in
some chefs and have some food cook.

6248
02:38:27,200 --> 02:38:27,411
Dude,

6249
02:38:27,411 --> 02:38:28,340
that's a great idea.

6250
02:38:28,370 --> 02:38:28,701
Jamie.

6251
02:38:28,701 --> 02:38:33,110
Pull up the Yoder 1500 and you show these
motherfuckers off to his landing all

6252
02:38:33,230 --> 02:38:37,790
day long and it costs for behind the
jab so he's like blinded by the jazz.

6253
02:38:37,791 --> 02:38:39,650
So long you can get away with it.

6254
02:38:39,760 --> 02:38:40,593
Yup.

6255
02:38:40,720 --> 02:38:42,410
Line blind them and bring them up.

6256
02:38:43,370 --> 02:38:44,900
Gustafson looks fantastic.

6257
02:38:45,740 --> 02:38:48,170
He beats everybody.

6258
02:38:48,200 --> 02:38:49,430
Do you think he beat John Jones?

6259
02:38:49,431 --> 02:38:50,030
I do.

6260
02:38:50,030 --> 02:38:50,863
Really?

6261
02:38:51,140 --> 02:38:54,470
If Jon Jones fought him
with this long of a layoff,

6262
02:38:54,620 --> 02:38:57,640
like let's say they were going to fight
and I don't know when you've taught Osp.

6263
02:38:57,650 --> 02:38:57,980
Yes,

6264
02:38:57,980 --> 02:38:58,880
he gets fucked up.

6265
02:38:59,010 --> 02:38:59,990
Oh look at this.

6266
02:39:00,020 --> 02:39:01,670
Look at this creative.

6267
02:39:01,750 --> 02:39:02,481
It really thinks so.

6268
02:39:02,481 --> 02:39:03,320
That's interesting.

6269
02:39:04,160 --> 02:39:04,993
Oh Shit.

6270
02:39:05,130 --> 02:39:05,860
It's all you buddy.

6271
02:39:05,860 --> 02:39:07,280
He looks outstanding here tonight.

6272
02:39:07,760 --> 02:39:08,593
Oh God.

6273
02:39:08,600 --> 02:39:11,420
With the lover is still in
this fight in every way.

6274
02:39:11,730 --> 02:39:12,740
Clover is a fucking animal.

6275
02:39:12,741 --> 02:39:13,670
He's fighting for his life,

6276
02:39:13,671 --> 02:39:14,120
man.

6277
02:39:14,120 --> 02:39:14,990
He's fighting for his cribs.

6278
02:39:14,991 --> 02:39:15,351
What he's doing,

6279
02:39:15,351 --> 02:39:16,700
I mean he's 37 years old.

6280
02:39:16,710 --> 02:39:19,250
He doesn't have much
time left and these are,

6281
02:39:19,340 --> 02:39:21,110
these opportunities are
few and far between.

6282
02:39:21,111 --> 02:39:22,580
Headlining a major card like,

6283
02:39:22,610 --> 02:39:23,570
oh,

6284
02:39:23,810 --> 02:39:24,860
you can take a shot.

6285
02:39:24,890 --> 02:39:25,551
And he's go over saying,

6286
02:39:25,551 --> 02:39:25,970
come on,

6287
02:39:25,970 --> 02:39:26,360
come on.

6288
02:39:26,360 --> 02:39:27,860
They're both fighting for calling him,

6289
02:39:27,861 --> 02:39:28,694
man.

6290
02:39:29,060 --> 02:39:30,020
You lose this one.

6291
02:39:30,500 --> 02:39:31,590
Come on to clover.

6292
02:39:31,591 --> 02:39:32,424
So aggressive.

6293
02:39:32,450 --> 02:39:33,110
It's crazy.

6294
02:39:33,110 --> 02:39:34,670
Even getting tagged like he's getting,

6295
02:39:34,820 --> 02:39:35,780
he's still in this.

6296
02:39:37,400 --> 02:39:38,540
See that baby right there.

6297
02:39:38,570 --> 02:39:39,403
Damn.

6298
02:39:39,440 --> 02:39:40,520
See that's a sick,

6299
02:39:40,550 --> 02:39:42,610
that's a sick grilled machines.

6300
02:39:42,740 --> 02:39:43,250
Of course.

6301
02:39:43,250 --> 02:39:43,620
Rogan,

6302
02:39:43,620 --> 02:39:43,941
ESCO,

6303
02:39:43,941 --> 02:39:45,110
extreme with the grill.

6304
02:39:45,320 --> 02:39:46,270
That's a smoker.

6305
02:39:46,310 --> 02:39:46,790
It's like,

6306
02:39:46,790 --> 02:39:48,050
well it grows.

6307
02:39:48,051 --> 02:39:48,711
It smokes.

6308
02:39:48,711 --> 02:39:50,570
You could do everything on
not just spit ball ideas.

6309
02:39:50,840 --> 02:39:52,590
Let's toss a fucking zebra in the,

6310
02:39:54,020 --> 02:39:54,853
I need a zero.

6311
02:39:54,920 --> 02:39:55,820
What are you eating now?

6312
02:39:55,821 --> 02:39:55,960
What?

6313
02:39:55,960 --> 02:39:56,361
What do you,

6314
02:39:56,361 --> 02:39:57,560
what do you have in your freezer?

6315
02:39:57,590 --> 02:39:58,423
Mostly elk.

6316
02:39:58,640 --> 02:39:59,121
Gosh,

6317
02:39:59,121 --> 02:40:00,480
I feel about 400 pounds.

6318
02:40:00,530 --> 02:40:01,363
What about some ribs?

6319
02:40:01,650 --> 02:40:02,361
Ribs that,

6320
02:40:02,361 --> 02:40:03,200
see that's what I'm talking about.

6321
02:40:03,201 --> 02:40:05,480
I shot a pig last money
and still have some thighs.

6322
02:40:06,410 --> 02:40:06,711
We eat.

6323
02:40:06,711 --> 02:40:07,544
The ribs are ready,

6324
02:40:08,060 --> 02:40:08,710
but I uh,

6325
02:40:08,710 --> 02:40:09,500
I have some.

6326
02:40:09,500 --> 02:40:10,040
Yeah,

6327
02:40:10,040 --> 02:40:10,311
I did.

6328
02:40:10,311 --> 02:40:10,910
I not eat.

6329
02:40:10,910 --> 02:40:11,890
I didn't need all the ribs.

6330
02:40:11,900 --> 02:40:13,260
Are you at a barbecue guy?

6331
02:40:13,261 --> 02:40:13,921
Do you have a,

6332
02:40:13,921 --> 02:40:14,754
you're

6333
02:40:14,820 --> 02:40:15,540
looking at that.

6334
02:40:15,540 --> 02:40:16,080
Oh man,

6335
02:40:16,080 --> 02:40:18,990
we should have a grill off cause I can
grill my gas on going to have to have a

6336
02:40:18,991 --> 02:40:19,824
real life.

6337
02:40:23,370 --> 02:40:24,030
How do you grill?

6338
02:40:24,030 --> 02:40:24,571
What do you do?

6339
02:40:24,571 --> 02:40:25,740
Do you a charcoal guy?

6340
02:40:26,090 --> 02:40:26,730
Nah,

6341
02:40:26,730 --> 02:40:27,360
gas.

6342
02:40:27,360 --> 02:40:27,870
Gas,

6343
02:40:27,870 --> 02:40:28,450
gas.

6344
02:40:28,450 --> 02:40:32,370
That's not even a nice filets ribs.

6345
02:40:32,400 --> 02:40:32,940
Fish,

6346
02:40:32,940 --> 02:40:33,361
salmon.

6347
02:40:33,361 --> 02:40:35,270
Especially that's a queer oven.

6348
02:40:35,360 --> 02:40:36,290
Nah Son.

6349
02:40:37,110 --> 02:40:37,860
Some weird of,

6350
02:40:37,860 --> 02:40:39,150
it's the Tesla of grills.

6351
02:40:41,880 --> 02:40:43,490
Justin Timberlake and Chris.

6352
02:40:43,491 --> 02:40:44,550
Funny to hear this.

6353
02:40:44,580 --> 02:40:45,630
Selling nothing.

6354
02:40:46,020 --> 02:40:46,231
No,

6355
02:40:46,231 --> 02:40:46,891
they both own.

6356
02:40:46,891 --> 02:40:48,690
A Timberlake owns a part of this company.

6357
02:40:48,691 --> 02:40:50,310
What does that make sense?

6358
02:40:50,430 --> 02:40:51,760
Antioxidant infusion.

6359
02:40:51,780 --> 02:40:53,370
Not just drink actual juice.

6360
02:40:53,371 --> 02:40:54,940
You fucks which you juice.

6361
02:40:54,941 --> 02:40:55,201
You don't.

6362
02:40:55,201 --> 02:40:56,034
God Damn Barry's.

6363
02:40:56,040 --> 02:40:56,551
Watch this.

6364
02:40:56,551 --> 02:40:57,510
Look at this combination.

6365
02:40:58,090 --> 02:40:58,870
Yep.

6366
02:40:58,870 --> 02:40:59,740
Boom.

6367
02:40:59,780 --> 02:41:00,613
Boom.

6368
02:41:01,130 --> 02:41:01,963
Boom.

6369
02:41:03,750 --> 02:41:05,050
He's Matrix.

6370
02:41:05,170 --> 02:41:07,710
Shitty falling down there
and land back in the Matrix.

6371
02:41:07,711 --> 02:41:09,630
Shit by Gustafson.

6372
02:41:09,870 --> 02:41:10,321
Look at this.

6373
02:41:10,321 --> 02:41:10,920
Bing,

6374
02:41:10,920 --> 02:41:11,640
bing,

6375
02:41:11,640 --> 02:41:12,473
bing.

6376
02:41:12,720 --> 02:41:12,871
Look,

6377
02:41:12,871 --> 02:41:13,111
get him.

6378
02:41:13,111 --> 02:41:13,470
Come on,

6379
02:41:13,470 --> 02:41:13,801
bring it.

6380
02:41:13,801 --> 02:41:14,100
Come on.

6381
02:41:14,100 --> 02:41:14,401
Come on.

6382
02:41:14,401 --> 02:41:15,234
Come on.

6383
02:41:15,710 --> 02:41:16,430
He said,

6384
02:41:16,430 --> 02:41:17,140
God damn.

6385
02:41:17,140 --> 02:41:17,973
Glover's tough.

6386
02:41:18,010 --> 02:41:21,180
So can be sharp as a knife.

6387
02:41:21,181 --> 02:41:22,014
10 years from now,

6388
02:41:22,020 --> 02:41:22,621
TRT,

6389
02:41:22,621 --> 02:41:23,490
get them onto Yardi.

6390
02:41:23,520 --> 02:41:24,353
Everybody,

6391
02:41:24,720 --> 02:41:25,331
the whole buddy,

6392
02:41:25,331 --> 02:41:26,130
the whole crew,

6393
02:41:26,130 --> 02:41:27,420
everybody including the garage.

6394
02:41:28,440 --> 02:41:29,520
We got a problem with Cyborg.

6395
02:41:29,521 --> 02:41:30,354
Everybody catch up.

6396
02:41:33,450 --> 02:41:34,283
Here we go.

6397
02:41:34,870 --> 02:41:35,500
Okay.

6398
02:41:35,500 --> 02:41:38,470
I love sidebar graph to that
podcast you did with her Brennan.

6399
02:41:38,650 --> 02:41:39,410
Thanks man.

6400
02:41:39,410 --> 02:41:40,270
You didn't love her before.

6401
02:41:40,580 --> 02:41:41,413
I love her anyway,

6402
02:41:41,470 --> 02:41:42,191
but I didn't know her,

6403
02:41:42,191 --> 02:41:43,360
but she's a beast.

6404
02:41:43,390 --> 02:41:44,950
She's awesome as a fighter.

6405
02:41:44,951 --> 02:41:45,910
She's a fucking beast,

6406
02:41:45,911 --> 02:41:46,151
man.

6407
02:41:46,151 --> 02:41:48,010
There's no question about that.

6408
02:41:48,070 --> 02:41:49,540
It seems like a good person too though.

6409
02:41:49,541 --> 02:41:50,440
That's what I like about her.

6410
02:41:50,890 --> 02:41:51,723
He would go,

6411
02:41:53,040 --> 02:41:53,381
that up.

6412
02:41:53,381 --> 02:41:55,160
Cut is coming in from fucking stock.

6413
02:41:55,200 --> 02:41:56,033
Stockholm.

6414
02:41:56,540 --> 02:41:56,920
Oh,

6415
02:41:56,920 --> 02:41:58,480
it goes to the body with a whip.

6416
02:41:58,560 --> 02:41:59,393
Oops.

6417
02:42:00,850 --> 02:42:01,840
They didn't want that brought worst.

6418
02:42:01,841 --> 02:42:02,081
Right,

6419
02:42:02,081 --> 02:42:03,760
so fucking

6420
02:42:06,440 --> 02:42:06,910
come on.

6421
02:42:06,910 --> 02:42:07,130
Come on.

6422
02:42:07,130 --> 02:42:07,650
It's crazy to me.

6423
02:42:07,650 --> 02:42:10,500
Like globe or is just
still fucking pumping away.

6424
02:42:10,510 --> 02:42:13,320
He looks like he's still a profit around
looking to knock them out and yeah,

6425
02:42:13,500 --> 02:42:16,760
we're in round four clover looks how
you would make a fighter in a video of

6426
02:42:16,770 --> 02:42:17,603
Jesus.

6427
02:42:18,210 --> 02:42:19,560
Just faking that.

6428
02:42:19,590 --> 02:42:20,221
Oh God.

6429
02:42:20,221 --> 02:42:22,470
That left overcome with the
right hand over the top.

6430
02:42:23,640 --> 02:42:24,220
How global.

6431
02:42:24,220 --> 02:42:26,580
It doesn't train with like any
super camps or nothing really?

6432
02:42:26,670 --> 02:42:26,941
No,

6433
02:42:26,941 --> 02:42:29,340
not even straight out of like
a garage in Connecticut hand.

6434
02:42:29,910 --> 02:42:30,390
Yeah,

6435
02:42:30,390 --> 02:42:31,111
that's what he does now,

6436
02:42:31,111 --> 02:42:31,680
right?

6437
02:42:31,680 --> 02:42:32,330
Yeah.

6438
02:42:32,330 --> 02:42:32,700
Yeah.

6439
02:42:32,700 --> 02:42:33,960
He has a school in Connecticut.

6440
02:42:34,260 --> 02:42:35,730
Didn't he go to att for a while?

6441
02:42:35,760 --> 02:42:35,941
Yeah,

6442
02:42:35,941 --> 02:42:36,774
he did,

6443
02:42:38,760 --> 02:42:39,870
but he lives in Connecticut.

6444
02:42:40,280 --> 02:42:42,510
Inspiring place to live
at all the places to go.

6445
02:42:42,511 --> 02:42:46,550
You're from Brazil and he moved to
Connecticut and wonder why maybe drives

6446
02:42:48,120 --> 02:42:48,920
what?

6447
02:42:48,920 --> 02:42:49,740
Yeah.

6448
02:42:49,740 --> 02:42:52,340
You learn to parents had a house
in Connecticut for 10 years.

6449
02:42:52,360 --> 02:42:54,860
One of the few places
I never perform again.

6450
02:42:54,960 --> 02:42:55,430
Bucket.

6451
02:42:55,430 --> 02:42:55,830
Yup.

6452
02:42:55,830 --> 02:42:57,950
How can inside joke people getting mad?

6453
02:42:57,990 --> 02:42:59,640
People from Connecticut
and sending me messages.

6454
02:42:59,641 --> 02:43:00,301
Come on Bro too.

6455
02:43:00,301 --> 02:43:02,010
They have a big a city though.

6456
02:43:02,370 --> 02:43:02,970
Yeah.

6457
02:43:02,970 --> 02:43:03,803
Hartford.

6458
02:43:04,150 --> 02:43:04,983
Hartford though.

6459
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:06,030
It's not a big city,

6460
02:43:06,120 --> 02:43:07,830
but it's definitely a city for ESPN,

6461
02:43:07,831 --> 02:43:08,664
for Bristol.

6462
02:43:08,700 --> 02:43:09,810
I feel like that's all there is.

6463
02:43:09,811 --> 02:43:10,644
And could that be,

6464
02:43:11,860 --> 02:43:12,780
why the fuck you lay there?

6465
02:43:12,781 --> 02:43:13,750
Dig Taxes.

6466
02:43:13,780 --> 02:43:14,613
Oh,

6467
02:43:14,920 --> 02:43:15,461
other there.

6468
02:43:15,461 --> 02:43:18,280
Because it's right next to New York
City and you can get a nice large,

6469
02:43:18,340 --> 02:43:20,530
large plot of land and make sense.

6470
02:43:20,690 --> 02:43:23,020
Big Rich investment bankers
living grant makes sense.

6471
02:43:23,110 --> 02:43:23,261
Yeah.

6472
02:43:23,261 --> 02:43:24,670
That's where a David Letterman lives.

6473
02:43:24,671 --> 02:43:25,120
Yeah.

6474
02:43:25,120 --> 02:43:26,050
David let them live there.

6475
02:43:26,110 --> 02:43:27,670
Got himself off a state.

6476
02:43:27,840 --> 02:43:28,930
I'd be the motherfucker,

6477
02:43:29,170 --> 02:43:31,360
a huge estate Nolan.

6478
02:43:31,480 --> 02:43:32,220
He balled.

6479
02:43:32,220 --> 02:43:34,260
They've got an estate.

6480
02:43:34,600 --> 02:43:35,350
Fuck.

6481
02:43:35,350 --> 02:43:36,970
I don't think he does
anything anymore though.

6482
02:43:37,050 --> 02:43:37,430
Dude.

6483
02:43:37,430 --> 02:43:38,270
Dave is a,

6484
02:43:38,620 --> 02:43:39,850
I think he's just kind of like chill him.

6485
02:43:39,851 --> 02:43:39,951
No,

6486
02:43:39,951 --> 02:43:41,110
he counts as money I think.

6487
02:43:41,590 --> 02:43:42,330
Yeah.

6488
02:43:42,330 --> 02:43:46,480
Just where these crib in
Atlanta is a fucking castle.

6489
02:43:46,570 --> 02:43:49,620
I'm sure he's got some Chitta Golf.

6490
02:43:49,630 --> 02:43:50,290
Jeff Foot.

6491
02:43:50,290 --> 02:43:51,140
The redneck toward

6492
02:43:52,660 --> 02:43:53,111
yeah,

6493
02:43:53,111 --> 02:43:54,020
him and uh,

6494
02:43:54,160 --> 02:43:54,993
Ron White.

6495
02:43:55,270 --> 02:43:56,740
I love that podcast you did with him.

6496
02:43:57,560 --> 02:43:58,393
That's great.

6497
02:43:58,490 --> 02:43:58,750
Okay.

6498
02:43:58,750 --> 02:43:59,583
Dave.

6499
02:44:02,050 --> 02:44:02,890
That's Dave Letterman.

6500
02:44:03,190 --> 02:44:04,150
Holy Shit.

6501
02:44:04,151 --> 02:44:06,280
That's what global scale like in 30 years.

6502
02:44:06,310 --> 02:44:06,590
Oh my.

6503
02:44:06,590 --> 02:44:07,900
He looks like glow or show like,

6504
02:44:08,180 --> 02:44:08,400
well,

6505
02:44:08,400 --> 02:44:10,240
didn't know Dave have heart surgery.

6506
02:44:10,750 --> 02:44:12,910
I feel like he had a holy fuck.

6507
02:44:13,480 --> 02:44:13,721
Yeah.

6508
02:44:13,721 --> 02:44:14,860
I feel like he had heart surgery.

6509
02:44:14,861 --> 02:44:15,730
Oh my God.

6510
02:44:15,731 --> 02:44:17,170
He looks horrible.

6511
02:44:17,320 --> 02:44:17,650
All right.

6512
02:44:17,650 --> 02:44:18,483
It just looks like,

6513
02:44:20,650 --> 02:44:22,300
remember when Tim Allen
became Santa Claus?

6514
02:44:22,450 --> 02:44:23,283
Yeah.

6515
02:44:24,460 --> 02:44:24,701
Yeah.

6516
02:44:24,701 --> 02:44:26,100
I love each gets to us all.

6517
02:44:26,590 --> 02:44:29,630
I looked at a picture of me with 10
years ago when I was 40 you'll always

6518
02:44:29,640 --> 02:44:30,180
handsome.

6519
02:44:30,180 --> 02:44:31,840
You look exactly the same about that.

6520
02:44:31,850 --> 02:44:32,810
You're so delicious.

6521
02:44:32,811 --> 02:44:33,060
Really good.

6522
02:44:33,060 --> 02:44:33,490
David.

6523
02:44:33,490 --> 02:44:33,791
Thank you.

6524
02:44:33,791 --> 02:44:34,410
Books.

6525
02:44:34,410 --> 02:44:34,690
That's,

6526
02:44:34,690 --> 02:44:36,040
that's what I've been
looking for on a Sunday.

6527
02:44:38,860 --> 02:44:39,400
It was,

6528
02:44:39,400 --> 02:44:39,671
shit,

6529
02:44:39,671 --> 02:44:41,730
I'm Brian Day and now it's turned into.

6530
02:44:41,731 --> 02:44:42,251
Now it's get,

6531
02:44:42,251 --> 02:44:44,680
at what point in life do you
just say we have fuck you money.

6532
02:44:44,681 --> 02:44:47,640
You say fuck you life where you
just let your body go into seat,

6533
02:44:47,650 --> 02:44:48,483
whatever.

6534
02:44:48,660 --> 02:44:50,650
Cause I'm sure a lot of
people are doing things,

6535
02:44:50,651 --> 02:44:52,720
but when you were in the public eye like,

6536
02:44:52,750 --> 02:44:52,931
oh,

6537
02:44:52,931 --> 02:44:54,280
he clipped him with a
right hand over the top.

6538
02:44:54,460 --> 02:44:55,480
When you're in the public eye,

6539
02:44:55,481 --> 02:44:56,500
like a David Letterman,

6540
02:44:56,501 --> 02:44:57,580
like most of your life,

6541
02:44:57,581 --> 02:45:00,700
and then you decided you
decided to not do that anymore,

6542
02:45:01,150 --> 02:45:03,160
then it becomes kind of interesting.

6543
02:45:03,180 --> 02:45:04,013
You can relax.

6544
02:45:04,450 --> 02:45:06,990
You have to be disappointed by
your look and make them look.

6545
02:45:06,991 --> 02:45:08,080
It's that 10 years ago.

6546
02:45:08,081 --> 02:45:09,940
Look at that Cutie Pie or similar,

6547
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:10,761
I assume not.

6548
02:45:10,761 --> 02:45:11,594
I was so much.

6549
02:45:11,650 --> 02:45:13,360
They look exactly the same on dude.

6550
02:45:13,361 --> 02:45:13,921
I appreciate it.

6551
02:45:13,921 --> 02:45:17,260
The drawback is 30 to 40 that's
where you're really dropped off,

6552
02:45:17,560 --> 02:45:19,200
but 40 to 50 if you're maintaining,

6553
02:45:19,800 --> 02:45:20,530
maintaining my,

6554
02:45:20,530 --> 02:45:21,910
seems like you work out more now.

6555
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:25,000
I do work out every day
and it doesn't do much.

6556
02:45:25,050 --> 02:45:26,360
Here's someone's alarm going on like,

6557
02:45:26,370 --> 02:45:27,203
God,

6558
02:45:27,850 --> 02:45:28,031
yeah,

6559
02:45:28,031 --> 02:45:28,630
I do.

6560
02:45:28,630 --> 02:45:29,463
Good ears.

6561
02:45:30,760 --> 02:45:32,050
I think I have bad ears by the way.

6562
02:45:32,410 --> 02:45:33,480
You probably do with age,

6563
02:45:33,590 --> 02:45:34,390
son.

6564
02:45:34,390 --> 02:45:35,010
Get them dig.

6565
02:45:35,010 --> 02:45:37,010
I'm always asking my
wife to turn the cell.

6566
02:45:37,020 --> 02:45:37,541
The boxing.

6567
02:45:37,541 --> 02:45:38,020
You do?

6568
02:45:38,020 --> 02:45:38,270
Yeah.

6569
02:45:38,270 --> 02:45:38,580
Yeah.

6570
02:45:38,580 --> 02:45:39,100
We'll do it.

6571
02:45:39,100 --> 02:45:40,420
Years of getting boxed in my ears.

6572
02:45:40,421 --> 02:45:41,320
He getting boxed up.

6573
02:45:41,340 --> 02:45:45,540
Borough clover's fucking just go away.

6574
02:45:46,540 --> 02:45:47,060
Game.

6575
02:45:47,060 --> 02:45:48,040
He didn't get the menu.

6576
02:45:48,580 --> 02:45:49,720
The fucking memo.

6577
02:45:50,160 --> 02:45:51,430
Good kick to the body there.

6578
02:45:51,790 --> 02:45:52,623
We're good.

6579
02:45:55,320 --> 02:45:57,070
Lower still looking for
that knockout punch,

6580
02:45:57,090 --> 02:45:57,430
man.

6581
02:45:57,430 --> 02:45:58,120
That's a fast,

6582
02:45:58,120 --> 02:45:58,953
always there.

6583
02:45:59,410 --> 02:46:00,400
The scary thing is if,

6584
02:46:00,530 --> 02:46:01,363
oh shit,

6585
02:46:01,420 --> 02:46:03,580
if Alexander slows down a little bit,

6586
02:46:03,650 --> 02:46:04,810
it gets the club was for me.

6587
02:46:05,010 --> 02:46:05,843
Yeah.

6588
02:46:06,220 --> 02:46:07,053
Oh my God.

6589
02:46:07,300 --> 02:46:08,200
Oh my God.

6590
02:46:08,201 --> 02:46:09,034
That Combo Stud.

6591
02:46:09,290 --> 02:46:10,810
He needs to stay in the
middle of the AUC gun.

6592
02:46:10,950 --> 02:46:12,140
Got Some certain yes.

6593
02:46:12,141 --> 02:46:14,420
Looks as good as he's
ever looked in this fight.

6594
02:46:14,421 --> 02:46:14,511
Yeah.

6595
02:46:14,511 --> 02:46:16,160
It really does like being them at light.

6596
02:46:16,161 --> 02:46:19,130
Heavyweight is so fluid and
this movement is excellent.

6597
02:46:19,520 --> 02:46:20,670
It's a big fight for him,

6598
02:46:20,671 --> 02:46:20,870
man.

6599
02:46:20,870 --> 02:46:21,411
Oh boy.

6600
02:46:21,411 --> 02:46:22,101
For both of them,

6601
02:46:22,101 --> 02:46:24,140
it's kind of career defining to be honest.

6602
02:46:25,010 --> 02:46:26,140
I hate to be good.

6603
02:46:27,170 --> 02:46:28,770
How many can you take of these?

6604
02:46:29,500 --> 02:46:30,333
Strange,

6605
02:46:30,710 --> 02:46:31,640
what's going on here?

6606
02:46:31,760 --> 02:46:32,593
Beautiful.

6607
02:46:33,500 --> 02:46:35,210
It's artistic performance,

6608
02:46:35,211 --> 02:46:35,441
man.

6609
02:46:35,441 --> 02:46:40,340
It really is the way he's been hiding
that opera cut is my favorite top in that

6610
02:46:40,341 --> 02:46:41,174
jab.

6611
02:46:41,270 --> 02:46:42,500
Is He your favorite for you?

6612
02:46:42,500 --> 02:46:43,460
Have a unique insight.

6613
02:46:43,490 --> 02:46:45,290
Knowing exactly how good he is.

6614
02:46:45,291 --> 02:46:46,071
Having trained with them.

6615
02:46:46,071 --> 02:46:46,550
You know,

6616
02:46:46,550 --> 02:46:48,410
I trained with both of them with clover.

6617
02:46:48,411 --> 02:46:49,244
I just,

6618
02:46:49,700 --> 02:46:50,510
you know,

6619
02:46:50,510 --> 02:46:53,690
I understand what he's doing in his
pacing and he's like the terminator.

6620
02:46:53,691 --> 02:46:54,501
He's very similar to it.

6621
02:46:54,501 --> 02:46:57,980
That's why I'd love to see him in DC fight
cause I've trained with and they have

6622
02:46:57,981 --> 02:46:59,120
very similar styles,

6623
02:46:59,300 --> 02:47:00,710
which just this relentless,

6624
02:47:00,890 --> 02:47:04,490
relentless forward pressure
and you're like God damn relax.

6625
02:47:04,610 --> 02:47:05,181
Slow down.

6626
02:47:05,181 --> 02:47:06,110
Speaking on a relentless to,

6627
02:47:06,111 --> 02:47:07,310
you're running like eight miles.

6628
02:47:07,311 --> 02:47:10,100
I've seen you run in
like some long distances.

6629
02:47:10,210 --> 02:47:12,290
Where are you running a outside my crib.

6630
02:47:12,830 --> 02:47:16,880
He just run the beach or something like
that on concrete or concrete in those

6631
02:47:16,881 --> 02:47:17,391
campaigns.

6632
02:47:17,391 --> 02:47:17,721
Shoes.

6633
02:47:17,721 --> 02:47:19,400
But my knees fucked up so I'm suing Kim.

6634
02:47:19,610 --> 02:47:20,443
Why are you,

6635
02:47:21,440 --> 02:47:23,960
why are you running on concrete
when the sand is right there?

6636
02:47:24,410 --> 02:47:25,221
Uh,

6637
02:47:25,221 --> 02:47:26,660
I dunno cause I like to run,

6638
02:47:26,750 --> 02:47:29,230
but this is like sand
better for you because the,

6639
02:47:29,330 --> 02:47:33,830
I run the San Marcus so I do is I run
one Santa Monica stairs and I run a mile

6640
02:47:34,070 --> 02:47:34,970
to Samak stairs.

6641
02:47:34,970 --> 02:47:35,511
Run a mile,

6642
02:47:35,511 --> 02:47:36,220
three sentences,

6643
02:47:36,220 --> 02:47:36,741
run a mile.

6644
02:47:36,741 --> 02:47:37,340
That's what I'm doing.

6645
02:47:37,340 --> 02:47:37,720
Oh,

6646
02:47:37,720 --> 02:47:38,540
interesting.

6647
02:47:38,540 --> 02:47:41,460
So the stairs are like to
sprint and then the mile was,

6648
02:47:42,170 --> 02:47:43,520
but my new yesterday was like,

6649
02:47:43,550 --> 02:47:43,881
Nah,

6650
02:47:43,881 --> 02:47:45,050
let's take a break bro.

6651
02:47:45,090 --> 02:47:45,891
I'm way too big.

6652
02:47:45,891 --> 02:47:46,910
If you're a heavy guy,

6653
02:47:46,940 --> 02:47:47,311
what do you weigh?

6654
02:47:47,311 --> 02:47:50,390
Like two 42 40 a to 38 yeah,

6655
02:47:50,391 --> 02:47:51,860
that's a lot of weight
to put on the knees.

6656
02:47:51,890 --> 02:47:52,341
I know,

6657
02:47:52,341 --> 02:47:52,551
man.

6658
02:47:52,551 --> 02:47:53,390
I got to figure it out.

6659
02:47:53,391 --> 02:47:54,021
I got to do something.

6660
02:47:54,021 --> 02:47:54,860
If you guys know what to do,

6661
02:47:54,920 --> 02:47:56,270
it's the inside of my knee,

6662
02:47:56,600 --> 02:47:57,433
but okay,

6663
02:47:57,440 --> 02:47:58,370
let me ask you this.

6664
02:47:58,760 --> 02:48:02,300
What do you think about
this UFC training facility?

6665
02:48:02,510 --> 02:48:03,830
Like who's going to go there?

6666
02:48:04,020 --> 02:48:04,853
I was so,

6667
02:48:05,600 --> 02:48:08,030
and they're going to pump Bain
like products into his body.

6668
02:48:11,330 --> 02:48:14,360
Fucking in between Brown
division in between rounds.

6669
02:48:14,361 --> 02:48:15,440
He steps in a Cryo Chamber,

6670
02:48:15,450 --> 02:48:15,771
by the way,

6671
02:48:15,771 --> 02:48:16,131
I'm sorry,

6672
02:48:16,131 --> 02:48:18,080
but look at Glover and round four.

6673
02:48:18,081 --> 02:48:19,850
After all that punishment
keeping his head,

6674
02:48:19,851 --> 02:48:24,851
he looks very fresh that one of the
problems with glow is he's so boxing

6675
02:48:24,921 --> 02:48:27,710
oriented in his attack and
with a guy like Gustafson,

6676
02:48:27,711 --> 02:48:30,170
he has such a large reach disadvantage.

6677
02:48:30,800 --> 02:48:32,750
So he's constantly moving forward,

6678
02:48:32,751 --> 02:48:33,950
but he doesn't throw kicks.

6679
02:48:34,280 --> 02:48:35,113
Oh.

6680
02:48:36,070 --> 02:48:40,310
Or a gusts when stop kick in
because he got taken down early on.

6681
02:48:40,311 --> 02:48:40,871
But his kid,

6682
02:48:40,871 --> 02:48:41,810
his kicks too.

6683
02:48:41,811 --> 02:48:43,340
I don't just abandoned it.

6684
02:48:43,370 --> 02:48:45,260
Keeping Away with us for Glover.

6685
02:48:45,740 --> 02:48:48,240
Glover has always got to
move into boxing changed.

6686
02:48:48,660 --> 02:48:49,470
Boy.

6687
02:48:49,470 --> 02:48:50,900
Oh my God.

6688
02:48:51,020 --> 02:48:53,690
Oh my God.

6689
02:48:55,030 --> 02:48:55,491
God.

6690
02:48:55,491 --> 02:48:56,324
What a fucking

6691
02:48:58,220 --> 02:48:59,000
shit.

6692
02:48:59,000 --> 02:49:00,970
Gustafson clover.

6693
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:02,270
Oh Jesus Christ.

6694
02:49:02,970 --> 02:49:04,400
I don't like seeing that at all.

6695
02:49:05,570 --> 02:49:06,740
I don't like seeing that at all.

6696
02:49:06,830 --> 02:49:07,970
I don't like seeing that at all

6697
02:49:08,390 --> 02:49:09,750
is a fucking beast.

6698
02:49:09,751 --> 02:49:11,010
That was brilliant.

6699
02:49:11,070 --> 02:49:12,120
God Damn,

6700
02:49:12,121 --> 02:49:12,721
that was brilliant.

6701
02:49:12,721 --> 02:49:13,351
That was brilliant,

6702
02:49:13,351 --> 02:49:13,830
man.

6703
02:49:13,830 --> 02:49:14,551
Holy Shit.

6704
02:49:14,551 --> 02:49:15,480
This is in Sweden.

6705
02:49:15,960 --> 02:49:16,793
Stockholm,

6706
02:49:16,830 --> 02:49:17,663
Stockholm.

6707
02:49:17,760 --> 02:49:19,380
Come around it down in Stockholm.

6708
02:49:19,381 --> 02:49:20,214
It's a fucking hero.

6709
02:49:20,220 --> 02:49:21,060
He's a hero.

6710
02:49:21,120 --> 02:49:21,811
He's a ledge.

6711
02:49:21,811 --> 02:49:22,644
And the,

6712
02:49:23,400 --> 02:49:26,280
the heartbreak you went through when
he wants to fucking Johnson there.

6713
02:49:26,281 --> 02:49:26,551
Man,

6714
02:49:26,551 --> 02:49:27,121
I was there,

6715
02:49:27,121 --> 02:49:27,311
man.

6716
02:49:27,311 --> 02:49:28,144
I feel like crying,

6717
02:49:29,040 --> 02:49:33,180
crying that they were walking out
of the arena with her head low was,

6718
02:49:33,181 --> 02:49:36,150
it was rough and it was a bad beating too.

6719
02:49:36,151 --> 02:49:36,984
You know,

6720
02:49:37,920 --> 02:49:38,850
fucking redemption.

6721
02:49:38,851 --> 02:49:39,684
What a viking.

6722
02:49:40,050 --> 02:49:40,883
What a fight.

6723
02:49:41,400 --> 02:49:42,233
Here's redemption.

6724
02:49:42,240 --> 02:49:45,000
Redemption is John Jones
Beats DC and airline.

6725
02:49:45,120 --> 02:49:46,280
They didn't do karate.

6726
02:49:46,290 --> 02:49:48,330
Jones Alexander cuffs in Stockholm.

6727
02:49:48,480 --> 02:49:49,270
Title.

6728
02:49:49,270 --> 02:49:50,103
Good.

6729
02:49:52,410 --> 02:49:54,000
You're not going to do it in Stockholm.

6730
02:49:54,001 --> 02:49:54,840
They do it in Vegas.

6731
02:49:54,841 --> 02:49:55,980
The real money's at Vegas,

6732
02:49:56,220 --> 02:49:57,120
unfortunately.

6733
02:49:57,740 --> 02:49:58,750
That's bull shit.

6734
02:49:58,760 --> 02:49:59,581
That's just how it goes.

6735
02:49:59,581 --> 02:50:02,160
But that's the reason why we haven't
been a doubling yet for Conor McGregor

6736
02:50:02,161 --> 02:50:03,510
fight being what we could do.

6737
02:50:03,520 --> 02:50:05,070
A soccer fucking stadium.

6738
02:50:05,490 --> 02:50:05,860
Oh,

6739
02:50:05,860 --> 02:50:08,420
Jannie keeps doing the same
combo and the right hand.

6740
02:50:10,160 --> 02:50:12,150
How much was that right away,

6741
02:50:12,180 --> 02:50:13,013
right?

6742
02:50:13,380 --> 02:50:14,270
Stupid fast.

6743
02:50:14,810 --> 02:50:15,601
A dude.

6744
02:50:15,601 --> 02:50:16,050
And he's like,

6745
02:50:16,050 --> 02:50:16,531
not enough.

6746
02:50:16,531 --> 02:50:17,040
Huh?

6747
02:50:17,040 --> 02:50:17,873
Go.

6748
02:50:18,400 --> 02:50:18,780
Oh,

6749
02:50:18,780 --> 02:50:22,500
beautiful timing to the way
he swung that right hand into,

6750
02:50:22,740 --> 02:50:25,560
look how he swings and right
hand and over the left guard.

6751
02:50:25,740 --> 02:50:26,071
Look at this.

6752
02:50:26,071 --> 02:50:26,904
Watch this.

6753
02:50:27,320 --> 02:50:27,901
See look.

6754
02:50:27,901 --> 02:50:31,410
There's swings that right hand
over the top corners like,

6755
02:50:31,411 --> 02:50:31,551
do,

6756
02:50:31,551 --> 02:50:33,480
do you think you want to
kind of avoid the upper cut?

6757
02:50:33,481 --> 02:50:33,721
He's like,

6758
02:50:33,721 --> 02:50:34,200
Nah,

6759
02:50:34,200 --> 02:50:35,170
we'll keep doing this.

6760
02:50:35,240 --> 02:50:36,300
There's nothing we can do.

6761
02:50:36,301 --> 02:50:37,870
We just gets hit and hit buys.

6762
02:50:38,850 --> 02:50:39,683
What are you going to do?

6763
02:50:40,030 --> 02:50:40,321
God,

6764
02:50:40,321 --> 02:50:41,850
that was brilliant man.

6765
02:50:42,120 --> 02:50:42,990
Brilliant performance.

6766
02:50:43,980 --> 02:50:46,020
When you were saying how
glow or just missed the it,

6767
02:50:46,021 --> 02:50:50,730
the it a little bit like that Boston
with his wrestling style via brand page.

6768
02:50:50,760 --> 02:50:52,920
He had been champ him
first rampage in the prime.

6769
02:50:52,921 --> 02:50:54,510
That's a motherfucking fight.

6770
02:50:54,690 --> 02:50:55,051
Yeah,

6771
02:50:55,051 --> 02:50:55,800
he could've won.

6772
02:50:55,800 --> 02:50:56,580
He could have won.

6773
02:50:56,580 --> 02:50:58,290
But you know what's
interesting is that he just,

6774
02:50:59,130 --> 02:51:00,750
because he doesn't throw very many kicks,

6775
02:51:00,751 --> 02:51:02,100
I mean he might throw in 10 kicks,

6776
02:51:02,101 --> 02:51:02,934
that whole fight.

6777
02:51:02,970 --> 02:51:05,580
He's always moving into boxing ranks.

6778
02:51:05,581 --> 02:51:08,340
She's getting chewed up on the
way in and it's tough as he is.

6779
02:51:08,610 --> 02:51:10,650
He's still getting tagged
over and over and over.

6780
02:51:10,651 --> 02:51:12,720
2017 if you're just boxing,

6781
02:51:12,990 --> 02:51:16,030
you're screwed man named guy
who's just boxing too alone.

6782
02:51:16,040 --> 02:51:16,800
The UFC.

6783
02:51:16,800 --> 02:51:17,101
Yeah,

6784
02:51:17,101 --> 02:51:17,730
you're right.

6785
02:51:17,730 --> 02:51:18,300
You're right.

6786
02:51:18,300 --> 02:51:20,280
You really have to do
whatever the highest level.

6787
02:51:20,281 --> 02:51:21,600
You just can't do it anymore.

6788
02:51:21,840 --> 02:51:22,830
Like guys figure it out.

6789
02:51:23,070 --> 02:51:23,551
Yeah,

6790
02:51:23,551 --> 02:51:24,990
you really have to be
able to do everything.

6791
02:51:26,370 --> 02:51:28,050
So this UFC training facility,

6792
02:51:28,051 --> 02:51:30,090
like how much did that fucking thing cost?

6793
02:51:30,450 --> 02:51:33,750
I was looking at that when they were
showing the athletes retreat crazier.

6794
02:51:33,751 --> 02:51:35,400
I was like how much do
you think that costs?

6795
02:51:37,230 --> 02:51:41,040
12 million performances to always
sang at $12 million performances too.

6796
02:51:41,041 --> 02:51:41,874
That's a bargain.

6797
02:51:41,880 --> 02:51:43,300
I've seen some types of good deal.

6798
02:51:43,320 --> 02:51:45,120
She said but that's in his paper in Vegas.

6799
02:51:45,121 --> 02:51:47,430
That's like the size of
fucking Lambeau field.

6800
02:51:47,431 --> 02:51:48,300
Like that's huge.

6801
02:51:49,150 --> 02:51:49,983
It's still though.

6802
02:51:50,370 --> 02:51:51,300
And what's it made for?

6803
02:51:51,301 --> 02:51:53,760
It's made for people when they're in town.

6804
02:51:53,950 --> 02:51:54,300
Yeah,

6805
02:51:54,300 --> 02:51:55,170
everything is there.

6806
02:51:55,171 --> 02:51:56,400
They have bags,

6807
02:51:56,401 --> 02:52:00,000
doctors and doctors and
they have a those aquatic,

6808
02:52:00,001 --> 02:52:00,870
that's what I was going to bring up.

6809
02:52:01,050 --> 02:52:06,050
They have those underwater treadmills
and I fell down the Mbas as I have not

6810
02:52:07,181 --> 02:52:07,690
done that.

6811
02:52:07,690 --> 02:52:10,330
That is what you should do
like for your big ass bro.

6812
02:52:10,330 --> 02:52:11,680
I'm trying to run outside man.

6813
02:52:11,800 --> 02:52:16,630
Let's try and run under water
like a why fucking why project?

6814
02:52:16,720 --> 02:52:17,590
I shot it right outside.

6815
02:52:17,770 --> 02:52:20,120
You don't want to be
loving side man rocky for,

6816
02:52:20,500 --> 02:52:23,960
I'm not doing it because I'm trying to
fucking scientific experiments under

6817
02:52:24,030 --> 02:52:24,863
Gusteson.

6818
02:52:25,030 --> 02:52:26,890
Do you see they're
making a to 25 division?

6819
02:52:27,310 --> 02:52:28,000
They are.

6820
02:52:28,000 --> 02:52:28,510
Yeah.

6821
02:52:28,510 --> 02:52:29,171
That's a good idea.

6822
02:52:29,171 --> 02:52:30,670
They're also going to do a 10 pound up.

6823
02:52:30,700 --> 02:52:34,720
They're going to do do like 55 65 75
wish they had that when I was around.

6824
02:52:34,750 --> 02:52:35,560
Wow.

6825
02:52:35,560 --> 02:52:36,580
That's a really good idea.

6826
02:52:37,590 --> 02:52:38,740
We thinking about coming back.

6827
02:52:38,940 --> 02:52:39,320
No.

6828
02:52:39,320 --> 02:52:40,060
What?

6829
02:52:40,060 --> 02:52:42,170
What is a soul that
was shown on the strip?

6830
02:52:42,730 --> 02:52:44,040
You get punched in the face anymore.

6831
02:52:44,100 --> 02:52:47,900
Just check till you take
towards your breakdown.

6832
02:52:47,920 --> 02:52:48,753
Way Better Fun.

6833
02:52:49,300 --> 02:52:50,133
That's my life.

6834
02:52:50,460 --> 02:52:50,771
You weren't,

6835

6837
02:52:52,510 --> 02:52:53,560
keep your hand on your hair.

6838
02:52:53,890 --> 02:52:54,910
I don't give a shit.

6839
02:52:54,940 --> 02:52:55,800
I don't even see Jack Craig.

6840
02:52:56,350 --> 02:52:57,183
What are you doing?

6841
02:52:57,280 --> 02:52:59,830
I'm just doing this to have
a summer body NAV or correct.

6842
02:52:59,831 --> 02:53:03,100

You're very excited about that.

6845
02:53:09,220 --> 02:53:12,220
I loved this incline bench
to get that shelf going.

6846
02:53:12,221 --> 02:53:13,031
I'm kind of not talking about,

6847
02:53:13,031 --> 02:53:16,150

6848

The kido shake.

6851
02:53:17,620 --> 02:53:18,730
What's in your Kido shake?

6852
02:53:18,731 --> 02:53:19,700
There was something on the honor,

6853
02:53:20,910 --> 02:53:22,980

It's fun to watch but it
feel sorry for Glover.

Great Guy.

6881
02:53:59,050 --> 02:53:59,201

02:54:04,180 --> 02:54:05,013
Like I went nuts.

6886
02:54:05,020 --> 02:54:07,720
I had ramen noodles this
morning with eggs to drama.

6887
02:54:07,721 --> 02:54:09,790
It was so unhealthy so
you don't realize it.

6888
02:54:09,791 --> 02:54:11,800
It's so bad for you see
it all the time as a kid.

6889
02:54:11,801 --> 02:54:12,634
Hey Dad,

one of the worst things you can eat.

6892
02:54:14,910 --> 02:54:17,770
I have like six a day and I
would take the two seasons.

6893
02:54:17,771 --> 02:54:20,260
His fucking girlfriend
put two seasonings in one,

6894
02:54:20,320 --> 02:54:21,670
so it was extra flavorful.

6895
02:54:21,700 --> 02:54:21,971
Oh yeah.

6896
02:54:21,971 --> 02:54:22,570

02:54:22,570 --> 02:54:22,730
Yeah.

Not to only you can answer it.

6899
02:54:23,960 --> 02:54:25,360
Ameriflux a beef for shrimp.

6900
02:54:25,690 --> 02:54:26,523
What's going on here?

6901
02:54:26,740 --> 02:54:28,060
Is he asking her to marry him?

6902
02:54:28,810 --> 02:54:30,390
Don't do it.

6903
02:54:32,470 --> 02:54:33,161
Every point.

6904
02:54:33,161 --> 02:54:33,821
They're going to happen.

6905
02:54:33,821 --> 02:54:35,140
Nice kid on them though.

6906
02:54:35,230 --> 02:54:36,190
They aren't good at that.

6907
02:54:36,200 --> 02:54:38,310
Kid's going to be out kicking.

6908
02:54:38,590 --> 02:54:39,940
Why do I feel like they
already have a kid?

6909
02:54:39,941 --> 02:54:42,400
Hopefully they do and she
had a powerful Rolex on.

6910
02:54:42,640 --> 02:54:45,640
I feel like they already have a kid
and he's just like making it a fish.

6911
02:54:45,820 --> 02:54:46,660
You know what that ring,

6912
02:54:46,690 --> 02:54:47,440
if you're gonna do on TV,

6913
02:54:47,440 --> 02:54:48,430
a better be a heater.

6914
02:54:48,550 --> 02:54:49,001
I like it.

6915
02:54:49,001 --> 02:54:51,160
I was doing it with the fucking gloves on.

6916
02:54:51,880 --> 02:54:53,710
He should just lift up
her skirt and bang around.

6917
02:54:53,711 --> 02:54:54,550
Hey,

6918

Got Those Viking.

6920
02:54:58,450 --> 02:54:59,470
Imagine if he did that.

6921
02:54:59,500 --> 02:55:00,450
Just animal,

6922
02:55:00,660 --> 02:55:01,481
so that's awesome.

6923
02:55:01,481 --> 02:55:02,530
Look at those two vikings.

6924
02:55:02,531 --> 02:55:03,890
They're going to have some fucking,

6925
02:55:04,130 --> 02:55:05,070
maybe she knows.

6926
02:55:05,510 --> 02:55:06,520
She knows how he is.

6927
02:55:06,560 --> 02:55:09,510
She just picks up her fucking
skirt or saw she does it.

6928
02:55:09,530 --> 02:55:11,030
She doesn't see that a six foot two.

6929
02:55:11,060 --> 02:55:11,211
Hey,

6930
02:55:11,211 --> 02:55:12,590
why are they the same size?

6931
02:55:12,591 --> 02:55:13,700
What the fuck is going on?

6932
02:55:13,701 --> 02:55:14,720
She's got high heels on,

6933
02:55:14,721 --> 02:55:16,910
but she's every bit naturally six feet.

6934
02:55:16,911 --> 02:55:17,990
She's a six foot or easy.

6935
02:55:18,140 --> 02:55:20,390
It's a big old healthy
woman and she's a little,

6936
02:55:20,580 --> 02:55:22,250

6937
02:55:22,950 --> 02:55:24,170
I like broad shoulders.

6938
02:55:24,260 --> 02:55:24,950
She's a biking.

6939
02:55:24,950 --> 02:55:25,280
Yeah,

6940
02:55:25,280 --> 02:55:26,240
I do not.

6941
02:55:26,750 --> 02:55:28,310
I do not hate at all.

6942
02:55:28,311 --> 02:55:29,930
A girl who's healthy like that.

6943
02:55:29,931 --> 02:55:31,250
Who eats good?

6944
02:55:31,270 --> 02:55:31,330
No,

6945
02:55:31,330 --> 02:55:36,330
it looks great that day that a baby have
a baby together doing a beat shop style

6946
02:55:39,210 --> 02:55:40,370
of the kid and then you do that.

6947
02:55:40,371 --> 02:55:40,881
You tune it out.

6948
02:55:40,881 --> 02:55:41,240
Right.

6949
02:55:41,240 --> 02:55:42,073
That's awesome.

6950
02:55:42,350 --> 02:55:44,150
Kid is going to be good for him.

6951
02:55:44,180 --> 02:55:44,840
Yeah.

6952
02:55:44,840 --> 02:55:45,673
Mm.

6953
02:55:45,770 --> 02:55:48,560
He put on a fucking performance
of his career tonight.

6954
02:55:48,600 --> 02:55:48,701
Well,

6955
02:55:48,701 --> 02:55:50,140
he's got to move mason to jump up to,

6956
02:55:50,480 --> 02:55:51,220
yeah.

6957
02:55:51,220 --> 02:55:51,301
No,

6958
02:55:51,301 --> 02:55:51,980
he's not.

6959
02:55:51,980 --> 02:55:52,813
He's number one.

6960
02:55:53,210 --> 02:55:54,440
He's number one for sure,

6961
02:55:54,441 --> 02:55:57,920
but that's just because John
Jones is on the banned list.

6962
02:55:58,250 --> 02:56:00,940
My boy Vulcan's like to say
what happened number one.

6963
02:56:01,210 --> 02:56:01,480
Hey,

6964
02:56:01,480 --> 02:56:02,151
I'm number one.

6965
02:56:02,151 --> 02:56:03,740
Alexander asked Amir.

6966
02:56:04,180 --> 02:56:04,840
Yeah.

6967
02:56:04,840 --> 02:56:06,830
Going to move up to probably four now.

6968
02:56:06,860 --> 02:56:08,180
I was in mirror with one punch,

6969
02:56:08,210 --> 02:56:09,230
four clovers giving.

6970
02:56:09,231 --> 02:56:13,490
Go ahead and jump back in line
behind this UFC training institute.

6971
02:56:13,491 --> 02:56:16,220
That's what I'm so confused
like what is ending?

6972
02:56:16,240 --> 02:56:17,870
No one's going to do their camp there.

6973
02:56:18,460 --> 02:56:19,200
How could you,

6974
02:56:19,200 --> 02:56:19,620
how?

6975
02:56:19,620 --> 02:56:21,650
How fair would that be
if you fight it out?

6976
02:56:21,830 --> 02:56:25,190
Let's say Michael Bisbing doing his
camp there and you El Students Camp in

6977
02:56:25,191 --> 02:56:26,210
Florida and you,

6978
02:56:26,211 --> 02:56:26,511
I was like,

6979
02:56:26,511 --> 02:56:26,720
wait,

6980
02:56:26,720 --> 02:56:29,090
I want to do my camp that he's

6981
02:56:33,280 --> 02:56:33,680
gay.

6982
02:56:33,680 --> 02:56:34,610
Jay's arts.

6983
02:56:35,690 --> 02:56:36,501
Don't fuck it.

6984
02:56:36,501 --> 02:56:37,334
She Thought,

6985
02:56:38,120 --> 02:56:38,311
oh,

6986
02:56:38,311 --> 02:56:38,631
forget it.

6987
02:56:38,631 --> 02:56:39,464
Jesus.

6988
02:56:39,620 --> 02:56:39,951
God,

6989
02:56:39,951 --> 02:56:41,180
they fucked up till that.

6990
02:56:41,181 --> 02:56:43,720
Don't forget Jesus and baby Jesus.

6991
02:56:43,730 --> 02:56:44,900
It's open to anybody.

6992
02:56:44,901 --> 02:56:47,930
You can start or end your camp here.

6993
02:56:48,380 --> 02:56:49,940
We have the best training facility.

6994
02:56:51,170 --> 02:56:52,310
It makes no sense.

6995
02:56:53,600 --> 02:56:55,790
I'm just confused as to what
they're trying to do with it.

6996
02:56:56,530 --> 02:56:59,270
I just know when I'm in Vegas you fucks.

6997
02:56:59,300 --> 02:57:00,133
You're going to train there.

6998
02:57:00,260 --> 02:57:01,040
Fuck yeah.

6999
02:57:01,040 --> 02:57:01,880
I bet you're not.

7000
02:57:02,510 --> 02:57:03,260
You don't get it,

7001
02:57:03,260 --> 02:57:04,550
but they won't let you have time.

7002
02:57:04,551 --> 02:57:05,384
I will.

7003
02:57:05,790 --> 02:57:06,650
I was going to make

7004
02:57:08,370 --> 02:57:09,230
you a celebrity.

7005
02:57:09,410 --> 02:57:10,260
Not really them.

7006
02:57:10,280 --> 02:57:12,850
If I tell him I called the UFC instead,

7007
02:57:12,860 --> 02:57:13,730
I'd like to get tickets.

7008
02:57:13,980 --> 02:57:14,660
They'd hook it up.

7009
02:57:14,660 --> 02:57:16,310
I explain to them where are they now.

7010
02:57:17,530 --> 02:57:18,790
That's that phase can be tough.

7011
02:57:20,380 --> 02:57:22,630
My feelings are already tight ship.

7012
02:57:22,640 --> 02:57:23,660
Depends on how this,

7013
02:57:23,990 --> 02:57:24,890
this thing,

7014
02:57:24,891 --> 02:57:25,940
this pilot,

7015
02:57:25,941 --> 02:57:27,740
the Goldbergs girls that didn't go.

7016
02:57:27,830 --> 02:57:28,663
You didn't find out?

7017
02:57:28,670 --> 02:57:29,503
No,

7018
02:57:29,630 --> 02:57:33,380
you didn't tell me this kind of awkward
but the governor's got picked up for two

7019
02:57:33,381 --> 02:57:34,100
more years.

7020
02:57:34,100 --> 02:57:34,491
Either way.

7021
02:57:34,491 --> 02:57:35,390
My Heart's still.

7022
02:57:35,630 --> 02:57:36,463
Yeah.

7023
02:57:36,800 --> 02:57:37,640
How often do you want it?

7024
02:57:37,700 --> 02:57:39,020
Like always be almost famous.

7025
02:57:39,021 --> 02:57:42,730
I've realized my partner sells how
fucking theaters and now Australia,

7026
02:57:42,760 --> 02:57:43,110
you know,

7027
02:57:43,110 --> 02:57:44,180
isn't that better though?

7028
02:57:44,390 --> 02:57:46,400
Like it keeps you humble I guess.

7029
02:57:46,530 --> 02:57:49,160
I suppose to a guy like shop was
just rocketing up the charts.

7030
02:57:49,161 --> 02:57:51,760
He's eventually going
to get a big head tilt.

7031
02:57:55,200 --> 02:57:55,820
I mean,

7032
02:57:55,820 --> 02:57:56,860
and it's also like you,

7033
02:57:56,861 --> 02:58:00,500
you'll have the fuel of being bitter
because you are more famous when you guys

7034
02:58:00,501 --> 02:58:02,520
started and then he surpasses,

7035
02:58:02,920 --> 02:58:03,753
that's been the case.

7036
02:58:03,870 --> 02:58:05,040
That's been the case in my career.

7037
02:58:05,600 --> 02:58:06,330
That's where my career,

7038
02:58:06,330 --> 02:58:07,350
but everybody does that to me.

7039
02:58:07,790 --> 02:58:08,720
Get the fuck out.

7040
02:58:08,730 --> 02:58:09,500
It'd be awesome.

7041
02:58:09,500 --> 02:58:10,260
I'm a failure.

7042
02:58:10,260 --> 02:58:10,830
What do you,

7043
02:58:10,830 --> 02:58:11,221
well,

7044
02:58:11,221 --> 02:58:12,300
you're not a failure.

7045
02:58:12,330 --> 02:58:13,610
You're a very successful God.

7046
02:58:13,620 --> 02:58:14,453
I'm being,

7047
02:58:15,360 --> 02:58:16,051
I'm being dramatic.

7048
02:58:16,051 --> 02:58:17,010
You're very successful.

7049
02:58:17,011 --> 02:58:17,844
I've been to your home,

7050
02:58:18,120 --> 02:58:18,550
the two.

7051
02:58:18,550 --> 02:58:19,383
Well,

7052
02:58:20,050 --> 02:58:21,810
and we give out the address.

7053
02:58:21,870 --> 02:58:22,570
Can I do that?

7054
02:58:22,570 --> 02:58:23,403
No,

7055
02:58:24,180 --> 02:58:24,811
he's very wealthy,

7056
02:58:24,811 --> 02:58:25,590
man.

7057
02:58:25,590 --> 02:58:28,170
Some bullshit artist trying
to say he's not successful.

7058
02:58:28,171 --> 02:58:28,900
There's a bunch of,

7059
02:58:28,900 --> 02:58:29,070
look,

7060
02:58:29,070 --> 02:58:32,940
if you make more than $35,000 you're
in the 1% of the world probably,

7061
02:58:32,941 --> 02:58:33,450
right?

7062
02:58:33,450 --> 02:58:33,721
No,

7063
02:58:33,721 --> 02:58:34,950
it is right be correct.

7064
02:58:35,010 --> 02:58:37,050
That is 100% like this combination.

7065
02:58:37,200 --> 02:58:38,250
Spinning elbow,

7066
02:58:38,251 --> 02:58:38,821
right hook,

7067
02:58:38,821 --> 02:58:39,421
left hook,

7068
02:58:39,421 --> 02:58:41,700
right uppercut and over the top.

7069
02:58:41,701 --> 02:58:42,900
Pop that jab in.

7070
02:58:43,080 --> 02:58:44,430
Oh for sure it needs it.

7071
02:58:44,570 --> 02:58:44,870
Oh yeah,

7072
02:58:44,870 --> 02:58:45,703
merged.

7073
02:58:45,840 --> 02:58:48,750
He immersed tonight is the most
exciting light heavyweight in the world.

7074
02:58:48,760 --> 02:58:48,970
Solo.

7075
02:58:48,970 --> 02:58:50,760
Then Daniel and John.

7076
02:58:51,750 --> 02:58:56,370
I can't wait for that to just
fucking Jab uppercut Christ.

7077
02:58:56,371 --> 02:58:57,630
It's so bad for your brain.

7078
02:58:57,840 --> 02:58:58,673
This is bad.

7079
02:58:59,790 --> 02:59:00,623
I hate it.

7080
02:59:01,140 --> 02:59:03,330
I just see his brain
rattling around that skull.

7081
02:59:04,000 --> 02:59:04,800
Amazing,

7082
02:59:04,800 --> 02:59:05,610
amazing.

7083
02:59:05,610 --> 02:59:07,890
Most finishes and UFC
light heavyweight history.

7084
02:59:08,190 --> 02:59:09,180
Jimmy Manoa.

7085
02:59:09,780 --> 02:59:10,613
Where's he at?

7086
02:59:11,520 --> 02:59:14,930
Shogun seven Gustafson
seven chuck [inaudible].

7087
02:59:15,030 --> 02:59:15,960
Jon Jones nine.

7088
02:59:16,080 --> 02:59:16,913
Wow.

7089
02:59:17,100 --> 02:59:18,360
That Jon Jones,

7090
02:59:18,361 --> 02:59:23,040
DC rematches cause to me
it's so interesting because
I didn't think DC looked at

7091
02:59:23,041 --> 02:59:25,350
great against rumble off as
more of rumbled not showed up.

7092
02:59:25,351 --> 02:59:25,590
Kate.

7093
02:59:25,590 --> 02:59:30,220
I thought DC like probably the
worst we've seen body wise was it?

7094
02:59:30,270 --> 02:59:31,830
I'm getting that itch.

7095
02:59:32,610 --> 02:59:35,190
Show these boys how to throw
an upper cut the right way.

7096
02:59:35,250 --> 02:59:37,030
Oh you know what?

7097
02:59:37,980 --> 02:59:39,150
That was a great uppercuts.

7098
02:59:39,300 --> 02:59:40,350
Silly what?

7099
02:59:40,680 --> 02:59:41,510
That's silly.

7100
02:59:41,510 --> 02:59:42,660
But what are you doing here?

7101
02:59:42,661 --> 02:59:44,220
He said he be in the article too.

7102
02:59:44,221 --> 02:59:44,431
He goes,

7103
02:59:44,431 --> 02:59:45,021
once I'm retired,

7104
02:59:45,021 --> 02:59:45,360
I'm retired.

7105
02:59:45,360 --> 02:59:46,290
There's no chance.

7106
02:59:46,830 --> 02:59:51,150
Well I see he sees
Gustafson beating Glover.

7107
02:59:51,420 --> 02:59:53,520
I don't even knock these guys out.

7108
02:59:53,940 --> 02:59:55,950
He might think you could
just jump back in there.

7109
02:59:56,440 --> 02:59:57,600
Does that make sense?

7110
02:59:57,690 --> 02:59:58,471
How crazy is that?

7111
02:59:58,471 --> 02:59:59,610
I'm getting that itch.

7112
02:59:59,760 --> 03:00:01,440
So I get the itch every now and then.

7113
03:00:01,441 --> 03:00:02,520
I've never telling anyone,

7114
03:00:02,550 --> 03:00:03,480
but how can he say that?

7115
03:00:03,481 --> 03:00:07,350
Right when he just got done
retiring after a world title fight.

7116
03:00:07,650 --> 03:00:08,161
You know why?

7117
03:00:08,161 --> 03:00:10,220
Because your business
manager it goes uh yeah.

7118
03:00:10,230 --> 03:00:11,340
So you were talking about that shit.

7119
03:00:11,550 --> 03:00:11,851
Listen,

7120
03:00:11,851 --> 03:00:15,310
the rambling pay 35
and this is the mascot,

7121
03:00:15,370 --> 03:00:16,800
a feminine Harry costs.

7122
03:00:16,860 --> 03:00:17,730
And then check this out.

7123
03:00:17,731 --> 03:00:18,660
So the marijuana,

7124
03:00:18,690 --> 03:00:19,730
you're an l,

7125
03:00:19,750 --> 03:00:20,970
it's tough business,

7126
03:00:20,971 --> 03:00:21,451
saturated,

7127
03:00:21,451 --> 03:00:23,040
saturated taxes.

7128
03:00:23,070 --> 03:00:24,120
So here's your taxes.

7129
03:00:24,270 --> 03:00:29,190
Taxes are 48% so you're going to make
about 40 grand a when you do the numbers,

7130
03:00:29,191 --> 03:00:29,461
man,

7131
03:00:29,461 --> 03:00:30,294
when you like,

7132
03:00:30,420 --> 03:00:31,980
people make this mistake all the time.

7133
03:00:31,980 --> 03:00:34,500
They go to buy a bunch of stuff and
they didn't do the real hard numbers.

7134
03:00:34,980 --> 03:00:36,120
Start talking to them and it's like,

7135
03:00:36,121 --> 03:00:37,050
oh fuck yeah,

7136
03:00:37,051 --> 03:00:39,150
there's a lot of people didn't
want to spend a lot of money.

7137
03:00:39,640 --> 03:00:40,473
Yeah,

7138
03:00:40,500 --> 03:00:40,681
well,

7139
03:00:40,681 --> 03:00:42,860
what's really fucked up by his Porsche?

7140
03:00:42,861 --> 03:00:43,740
Let's talk about that.

7141
03:00:43,770 --> 03:00:43,970
Yeah,

7142
03:00:43,970 --> 03:00:44,803
I'm just kidding.

7143
03:00:44,970 --> 03:00:45,803
I'm not that dumb.

7144
03:00:45,930 --> 03:00:47,870
Don't buy that old portion
of Lincoln you're doing,

7145
03:00:47,920 --> 03:00:48,753
you're going to love it.

7146
03:00:48,830 --> 03:00:51,120
Do you see it has the
brand new turbo rims on it?

7147
03:00:51,121 --> 03:00:52,020
It's ridiculous.

7148
03:00:52,050 --> 03:00:53,160
Brand new turbo rems.

7149
03:00:53,161 --> 03:00:53,994
You're hilarious.

7150
03:00:54,020 --> 03:00:54,630
Do you see this?

7151
03:00:54,630 --> 03:00:58,050
I've seen a lot of actors not do those
numbers and been in their house and God,

7152
03:00:58,380 --> 03:01:00,010
you're on a series now with this house

7153
03:01:00,010 --> 03:01:00,520
is a,

7154
03:01:00,520 --> 03:01:02,790
you're nuts about 40
grand a month and your,

7155
03:01:03,090 --> 03:01:05,500
your show is going to go away
and you're just an actor.

7156
03:01:05,570 --> 03:01:06,041
How crazy.

7157
03:01:06,041 --> 03:01:07,360
Then a few in the same
thing over and over.

7158
03:01:07,361 --> 03:01:07,841
As you know,

7159
03:01:07,841 --> 03:01:09,790
as an actor you've had how many failures,

7160
03:01:09,800 --> 03:01:10,001
you know,

7161
03:01:10,001 --> 03:01:13,400
it's nothing because it's going to end
cause this is the ones it's friend cause

7162
03:01:13,410 --> 03:01:14,740
cause in as an actor you go,

7163
03:01:14,980 --> 03:01:17,050
this is the job that's going
to push me over the edge.

7164
03:01:17,051 --> 03:01:19,900
I'm now famous and I'm gonna go from
job to job and it never happens.

7165
03:01:20,290 --> 03:01:20,771
And I see,

7166
03:01:20,771 --> 03:01:22,780
I've seen it too many times.

7167
03:01:22,990 --> 03:01:23,421
It happens.

7168
03:01:23,421 --> 03:01:24,130
There's some people.

7169
03:01:24,130 --> 03:01:26,200
Yeah we were you always
good with money Joe.

7170
03:01:26,201 --> 03:01:27,730
You cause you always made money.

7171
03:01:27,970 --> 03:01:29,080
Business managers you have,

7172
03:01:29,081 --> 03:01:30,700
so I'm harping on your right way.

7173
03:01:30,760 --> 03:01:31,750
Um,

7174
03:01:31,900 --> 03:01:33,150
I'm pretty good at it.

7175
03:01:33,210 --> 03:01:33,761
Here's the thing,

7176
03:01:33,761 --> 03:01:38,761
I like cars but I don't spend like a lot
of money on jewelry or stupid shit and

7177
03:01:39,671 --> 03:01:39,970
cars.

7178
03:01:39,970 --> 03:01:42,310
You could actually sell
like pen on the car.

7179
03:01:42,311 --> 03:01:42,450
Yeah.

7180
03:01:42,450 --> 03:01:42,730
Yeah.

7181
03:01:42,730 --> 03:01:44,130
My cars are worse investments.

7182
03:01:44,131 --> 03:01:44,241
We,

7183
03:01:44,241 --> 03:01:44,410
yeah,

7184
03:01:44,410 --> 03:01:47,740
some of them are bad investments with
like my Corvettes worth a lot of money.

7185
03:01:47,741 --> 03:01:50,710
Like those are like old
cars you could sell,

7186
03:01:50,800 --> 03:01:51,550
they're worth money.

7187
03:01:51,550 --> 03:01:52,510
Buys made money though.

7188
03:01:52,511 --> 03:01:55,720
You always made more money than most
people know more than you right now.

7189
03:01:55,760 --> 03:01:57,970
And most of us as actors and stuff,

7190
03:01:57,971 --> 03:01:58,804
you're always,

7191
03:01:59,180 --> 03:02:00,013
yeah,

7192
03:02:00,070 --> 03:02:01,390
I always do a bunch of different things.

7193
03:02:01,391 --> 03:02:06,391
That's one thing I don't like having a
boss and I don't like having to count on

7194
03:02:06,521 --> 03:02:08,920
someone and I like when
you have fuck you money,

7195
03:02:08,921 --> 03:02:10,060
if you don't say fuck you,

7196
03:02:10,061 --> 03:02:12,040
I think it's a fucking disgrace.

7197
03:02:12,370 --> 03:02:13,930
It's a disgrace to the fuck you money.

7198
03:02:13,931 --> 03:02:14,800
If you don't say fuck it,

7199
03:02:14,801 --> 03:02:15,880
you have to get there though.

7200
03:02:15,910 --> 03:02:16,061
Yeah,

7201
03:02:16,061 --> 03:02:16,920
you got to have lunch today.

7202
03:02:16,960 --> 03:02:17,620
Fuck you money.

7203
03:02:17,620 --> 03:02:19,360
You're making 70 grand a year.

7204
03:02:19,390 --> 03:02:19,540
No,

7205
03:02:19,540 --> 03:02:19,661
no,

7206
03:02:19,661 --> 03:02:20,050
no.

7207
03:02:20,050 --> 03:02:21,340
But once you get fuck you money,

7208
03:02:21,341 --> 03:02:22,810
you have to know what it is like you,

7209
03:02:22,811 --> 03:02:24,040
okay now you have the opportunity.

7210
03:02:24,041 --> 03:02:25,330
You were in a fuck you position.

7211
03:02:25,630 --> 03:02:27,490
So you gotta know when to say fuck you.

7212
03:02:27,491 --> 03:02:30,370
And when you're just saying fuck
you because you have fuck you money.

7213
03:02:30,520 --> 03:02:31,900
That does happen to people too.

7214
03:02:32,140 --> 03:02:34,570
They get that fucking money and then
they can't wait to say fuck you.

7215
03:02:34,900 --> 03:02:36,970
And they pull the trigger
on fuck you too quick.

7216
03:02:37,750 --> 03:02:37,961
Oh,

7217
03:02:37,961 --> 03:02:38,794
that's not a good

7218
03:02:40,320 --> 03:02:41,260
waiting for the does.

7219
03:02:41,270 --> 03:02:41,711
And we know,

7220
03:02:41,711 --> 03:02:42,544
we know people,

7221
03:02:42,560 --> 03:02:45,430
we know because what happens is
you've got $6 million in the bank,

7222
03:02:45,431 --> 03:02:46,960
but you start spending $1 million a year.

7223
03:02:46,990 --> 03:02:48,460
I've seen that plenty of times.

7224
03:02:48,640 --> 03:02:49,091
What'd you say?

7225
03:02:49,091 --> 03:02:53,050
Be a lot of guys get $6 million in
the bank and they'll start spending $1

7226
03:02:53,050 --> 03:02:53,380
million a year.

7227
03:02:53,380 --> 03:02:54,220
And I've seen that.

7228
03:02:54,370 --> 03:02:56,380
So you get six years
ago out like a gangster.

7229
03:02:56,410 --> 03:02:56,660
Yeah,

7230
03:02:56,660 --> 03:02:58,330
those six years or so fun though.

7231
03:02:58,760 --> 03:02:59,110
My,

7232
03:02:59,110 --> 03:02:59,740
my buddy,

7233
03:02:59,740 --> 03:03:04,270
my buddy was making a lot of money and
he came and he looked like he'd seen a

7234
03:03:04,271 --> 03:03:05,680
ghost and he said,

7235
03:03:05,681 --> 03:03:10,270
my business manager just told me I have
to make $900,000 a year just to break

7236
03:03:10,271 --> 03:03:10,780
even.

7237
03:03:10,780 --> 03:03:11,440
And I went,

7238
03:03:11,440 --> 03:03:12,620
what do you spam dances?

7239
03:03:12,990 --> 03:03:13,300
Yup.

7240
03:03:13,300 --> 03:03:13,631
And I go,

7241
03:03:13,631 --> 03:03:14,640
what are you spending money on?

7242
03:03:14,690 --> 03:03:15,523
He goes,

7243
03:03:16,000 --> 03:03:16,751
just stuff.

7244
03:03:16,751 --> 03:03:17,290
And I said,

7245
03:03:17,290 --> 03:03:17,501
what?

7246
03:03:17,501 --> 03:03:17,831
He goes,

7247
03:03:17,831 --> 03:03:18,730
I got two nannies,

7248
03:03:18,731 --> 03:03:19,870
I got three cars,

7249
03:03:19,871 --> 03:03:20,770
I got a big house,

7250
03:03:20,771 --> 03:03:21,461
but I don't know,

7251
03:03:21,461 --> 03:03:22,294
just stuff.

7252
03:03:22,540 --> 03:03:23,680
And he couldn't really figure out,

7253
03:03:23,681 --> 03:03:23,920
you know,

7254
03:03:23,920 --> 03:03:26,410
until his business manager went
line for line and was like,

7255
03:03:26,411 --> 03:03:27,460
this is what you're spending.

7256
03:03:28,030 --> 03:03:31,660
But you know what happens too
when you start making money,

7257
03:03:31,690 --> 03:03:34,090
you start hanging out with other
people that are making money.

7258
03:03:34,540 --> 03:03:34,901
You know,

7259
03:03:34,901 --> 03:03:38,440
I was talking to this pro football player
who was telling me that he was saying

7260
03:03:38,441 --> 03:03:42,160
that basically what happens is you're
around all these other dudes and camp and

7261
03:03:42,161 --> 03:03:45,460
the dude shows up with a roles
and this guy's got a Bentley in,

7262
03:03:45,461 --> 03:03:47,840
this guy's got a giant gold chain and,

7263
03:03:48,030 --> 03:03:48,551
and he goes,

7264
03:03:48,551 --> 03:03:50,560
you start spending money just
to keep up with these people.

7265
03:03:50,890 --> 03:03:52,660
Well Kevin Hart has a
funny bit about that,

7266
03:03:52,661 --> 03:03:57,350
where he's hanging out with Dwayne Wade
and those guys and they were talking and

7267
03:03:57,351 --> 03:03:57,741
Kevin's like,

7268
03:03:57,741 --> 03:03:58,850
I'm making money and doing what?

7269
03:03:58,851 --> 03:03:59,121
It was like,

7270
03:03:59,121 --> 03:03:59,960
you should buy a boat.

7271
03:04:00,470 --> 03:04:01,130
He was like,

7272
03:04:01,130 --> 03:04:01,963
what the fuck?

7273
03:04:02,770 --> 03:04:04,020
Fuck God.

7274
03:04:04,700 --> 03:04:05,590
And then they were pulling,

7275
03:04:05,600 --> 03:04:08,210
they were a club and he and Kevin was
let me get their check and Dwayne was

7276
03:04:08,211 --> 03:04:08,301
like,

7277
03:04:08,301 --> 03:04:08,721
let me get it.

7278
03:04:08,721 --> 03:04:08,901
He goes,

7279
03:04:08,901 --> 03:04:09,471
now let me get it,

7280
03:04:09,471 --> 03:04:09,711
man.

7281
03:04:09,711 --> 03:04:10,380
Let me get it.

7282
03:04:10,380 --> 03:04:11,510
And he looked at the bill and he was,

7283
03:04:11,511 --> 03:04:12,360
it was so expensive.

7284
03:04:12,361 --> 03:04:14,720
He had to bring it in the light to
make sure he had the number right.

7285
03:04:14,721 --> 03:04:15,081
He was like,

7286
03:04:15,081 --> 03:04:15,940
what does it

7287
03:04:17,600 --> 03:04:18,440
hurt now though?

7288
03:04:19,150 --> 03:04:20,630
But if that's what you want to do,

7289
03:04:20,631 --> 03:04:22,640
like if he just want to
concentrate on money,

7290
03:04:22,910 --> 03:04:26,690
I mean the real problem is that
requires a mindset of it's own.

7291
03:04:26,691 --> 03:04:30,350
And a lot of the people that are just
financial entrepreneurs and people that

7292
03:04:30,351 --> 03:04:32,030
are like obsessed with making money,

7293
03:04:32,300 --> 03:04:34,730
they're not also creative geniuses.

7294
03:04:34,970 --> 03:04:38,530
They're not also pursuing
a career in PR in the arts.

7295
03:04:38,560 --> 03:04:39,393
They're not Jevity.

7296
03:04:39,410 --> 03:04:39,741
Yeah,

7297
03:04:39,741 --> 03:04:42,630
I mean it's just you gotta you
gotta know like what you're,

7298
03:04:42,631 --> 03:04:43,490
you're getting into.

7299
03:04:43,491 --> 03:04:47,780
So if you're a guy that just gets wrapped
up and hanging around with rich people

7300
03:04:47,781 --> 03:04:49,070
and keeping up with the Joneses,

7301
03:04:49,120 --> 03:04:50,790
and if you an Indian stocks,

7302
03:04:51,050 --> 03:04:52,040
if you're an athlete,

7303
03:04:52,041 --> 03:04:55,370
it could wind up fucking up your career
because you get so wrapped up in that

7304
03:04:55,371 --> 03:04:57,350
stuff that it takes some focus away.

7305
03:04:57,400 --> 03:04:58,233
Tell what else happens.

7306
03:04:58,250 --> 03:04:58,671
You did it.

7307
03:04:58,671 --> 03:04:58,891
You,

7308
03:04:58,891 --> 03:04:59,990
you're married to a girl,

7309
03:05:00,260 --> 03:05:03,540
she's hanging out with their wives
and now she wants to get that,

7310
03:05:03,950 --> 03:05:05,180
that $10,000 handbag.

7311
03:05:05,181 --> 03:05:06,060
She wants that.

7312
03:05:06,380 --> 03:05:06,860
Ben's,

7313
03:05:06,860 --> 03:05:07,693
she wants that.

7314
03:05:08,000 --> 03:05:09,950
And you don't want to make
her feel like she's not.

7315
03:05:09,951 --> 03:05:10,940
So she's in that group.

7316
03:05:11,000 --> 03:05:11,950
School's in session.

7317
03:05:11,990 --> 03:05:12,490
Talk to us.

7318
03:05:12,490 --> 03:05:13,120

7337
03:05:38,781 --> 03:05:39,680
craziest way.

7338
03:05:39,710 --> 03:05:39,891

What's the sign?

7346
03:05:46,580 --> 03:05:47,413
What's a good sign?

7347
03:05:48,500 --> 03:05:49,460
Oh man,

7348
03:05:49,490 --> 03:05:51,050
there's so many red flags.

7349
03:05:51,290 --> 03:05:52,220
Where do I start?

7350
03:05:52,760 --> 03:05:54,050
Where do I start?

7351
03:05:54,200 --> 03:05:54,920
That's by the way,

7352
03:05:54,920 --> 03:05:55,880
maybe your favorite.

7353

My favorite shirt from you guys.

7354
03:05:59,960 --> 03:06:01,110
We are bringing the leg.

7355
03:06:05,440 --> 03:06:06,410
So why

7356
03:06:08,170 --> 03:06:11,120
slowly where the term
chicken had come from?

7357
03:06:11,550 --> 03:06:15,440
I just comes out with things because
he had no chickens run around.

7358
03:06:15,470 --> 03:06:16,100
It's been around.

7359
03:06:16,100 --> 03:06:17,180
But where did it come from?

7360
03:06:17,390 --> 03:06:19,040
I uh,

7361
03:06:19,100 --> 03:06:20,300

7362
03:06:20,360 --> 03:06:20,600
uh,

7363
03:06:20,600 --> 03:06:22,640
at the time I was dating some
girl and she was a chicken head.

7364
03:06:22,930 --> 03:06:24,380
I'm thinking why don't I went damn here,

7365
03:06:24,381 --> 03:06:25,490
one thirsty chicken head.

7366
03:06:25,860 --> 03:06:26,511
And she was like,

7367
03:06:26,511 --> 03:06:27,021

7368
03:06:27,021 --> 03:06:27,854

03:06:52,130 --> 03:06:56,580
but I had never like heard someone use
it where I started Holloway and I started

7446
03:08:54,211 --> 03:08:54,601
But yeah,

7447
03:08:54,601 --> 03:08:59,370
he tried to do that in minority spin that
in minority dive hit him right in the

7448
03:08:59,371 --> 03:09:00,180
face.

7449
03:09:00,180 --> 03:09:03,240
Chicken head is maybe my
favorite expression for a girl.

7450
03:09:03,250 --> 03:09:04,083
It's not you.

7451
03:09:04,610 --> 03:09:07,770
They don't call you like a
piece of shit for doing it yet.

7452
03:09:08,010 --> 03:09:11,490
I don't think the feminists
haven't caught on chicken head yet.

7453
03:09:11,550 --> 03:09:11,821
No.

7454
03:09:11,821 --> 03:09:13,060
That's why it's still cool right now.

7455
03:09:13,140 --> 03:09:16,740
The feminists don't like chicken
heads anyway and there are that.

7456
03:09:16,750 --> 03:09:18,120
That's a phenomenon that exists.

7457
03:09:18,150 --> 03:09:21,260
Rising nationals on team
vagina before anybody else.

7458
03:09:21,270 --> 03:09:22,560
Chicken head gets more popular.

7459
03:09:22,561 --> 03:09:23,394
We're all screwed.

7460
03:09:23,910 --> 03:09:25,140
Like there's a lot of
people that are saying,

7461
03:09:25,141 --> 03:09:26,370
you shouldn't say bitch anymore.

7462
03:09:26,950 --> 03:09:29,850
I got stuff to do and I'll
come on bitch a bitch.

7463
03:09:29,851 --> 03:09:30,410
Get outta here.

7464
03:09:30,410 --> 03:09:31,021
Fuck out of here.

7465
03:09:31,021 --> 03:09:32,000
It means too many different.

7466
03:09:32,010 --> 03:09:34,020
Try to take my language
away from it not to.

7467
03:09:34,140 --> 03:09:35,040
I went saw wonder woman.

7468
03:09:35,041 --> 03:09:35,281
I was like,

7469
03:09:35,281 --> 03:09:36,900
I can't wait to this chicken had to work.

7470
03:09:38,100 --> 03:09:39,000
They don't give a fuck.

7471
03:09:39,300 --> 03:09:39,960
They don't know.

7472
03:09:39,960 --> 03:09:40,650
You know?

7473
03:09:40,650 --> 03:09:41,570
They don't know.

7474
03:09:41,760 --> 03:09:42,110
No,

7475
03:09:42,110 --> 03:09:42,571
they don't know.

7476
03:09:42,571 --> 03:09:44,760
You can still get away with
this chicken and throw it down.

7477
03:09:45,990 --> 03:09:47,820
What is this thought thought?

7478
03:09:47,870 --> 03:09:48,540
No,

7479
03:09:48,540 --> 03:09:49,090
sure.

7480
03:09:49,090 --> 03:09:54,090
You guys called girls in schools that
send out nudes and porn of themselves and

7481
03:09:55,631 --> 03:09:58,960
acra them to that hoe over there.

7482
03:09:58,990 --> 03:10:01,630
Can you hot and this like a
spelling bee for the hood.

7483
03:10:01,660 --> 03:10:02,800
That's what I can I can I,

7484
03:10:02,830 --> 03:10:04,900

7485
03:10:04,930 --> 03:10:08,350
if you bang her but a rapid good that
thought has given herpes and half the

7486
03:10:08,351 --> 03:10:09,184
school.

7487
03:10:09,250 --> 03:10:10,390
I'm not going with that one.

7488
03:10:10,420 --> 03:10:11,470
That's not going to last.

7489
03:10:11,530 --> 03:10:11,771
No,

7490
03:10:11,771 --> 03:10:13,840
I don't like it or off for a few
years around for a while though.

7491
03:10:13,960 --> 03:10:15,670
It's not techy enough chicken.

7492
03:10:15,671 --> 03:10:16,510
That's hilarious.

7493
03:10:16,511 --> 03:10:17,171
If you use that,

7494
03:10:17,171 --> 03:10:18,070
you're probably annoying.

7495
03:10:18,340 --> 03:10:18,880
Yeah.

7496
03:10:18,880 --> 03:10:20,940
Thought column a thought
that Hoe over there.

7497
03:10:20,941 --> 03:10:22,120
How about just say that hole over there?

7498
03:10:22,170 --> 03:10:22,320
Sure.

7499
03:10:22,320 --> 03:10:25,120
So stop like making girls
feel bad about being sluts.

7500
03:10:25,270 --> 03:10:25,601
Yeah.

7501
03:10:25,601 --> 03:10:26,520
Why you slut shaming?

7502
03:10:26,521 --> 03:10:26,840
Yes.

7503
03:10:26,840 --> 03:10:27,400

I have celebrated so we have more of it.

7506
03:10:30,280 --> 03:10:30,420
Yeah.

7507
03:10:30,420 --> 03:10:31,600
It was called the chicken coop.

7508
03:10:31,601 --> 03:10:32,800
Don't you appreciate road head?

7509
03:10:32,890 --> 03:10:33,723
Yeah.

7510
03:10:34,390 --> 03:10:35,410
It's on us to do it.

7511
03:10:35,440 --> 03:10:36,273
Yeah.

7512
03:10:36,730 --> 03:10:37,690
You stupid bitch.

7513
03:10:37,700 --> 03:10:38,800
It takes a certain mentality.

7514
03:10:38,801 --> 03:10:40,510
It's suck your Dick while
you driving an automobile.

7515
03:10:40,511 --> 03:10:41,260
Correct.

7516
03:10:41,260 --> 03:10:42,370
Those girls are important.

7517
03:10:42,790 --> 03:10:44,730
This is just every girl.

7518
03:10:44,770 --> 03:10:45,071
You know what?

7519
03:10:45,071 --> 03:10:45,881
I'm just going to sign off.

7520
03:10:45,881 --> 03:10:46,500
You haven't yet.

7521
03:10:46,500 --> 03:10:47,370
This is over.

7522
03:10:47,580 --> 03:10:48,330
This fucking,

7523
03:10:48,330 --> 03:10:49,110
you're done.

7524
03:10:49,110 --> 03:10:49,771
You're dead to me.

7525
03:10:49,771 --> 03:10:50,670
Brian Cowen.

7526
03:10:51,190 --> 03:10:53,010
I always thought you were sophisticated.

7527
03:10:53,280 --> 03:10:55,230
I listen to your podcast on your own.

7528
03:10:55,410 --> 03:10:56,550
You read a lot of books.

7529
03:10:57,030 --> 03:10:57,420
No,

7530
03:10:57,420 --> 03:10:58,320
he's intrigued me,

7531
03:10:58,321 --> 03:11:01,440
but I know you're a piece of shit
like you're fucking meathead friends.

7532
03:11:01,760 --> 03:11:03,300
You do get chicken.

7533
03:11:03,380 --> 03:11:05,370
I get scolded for not
correct in the conversation.

7534
03:11:05,371 --> 03:11:06,930
Sometimes I thought more of you.

7535
03:11:06,931 --> 03:11:07,201
I'm like,

7536
03:11:07,201 --> 03:11:08,100
oh Jesus Christ.

7537
03:11:08,430 --> 03:11:08,940
There's nothing.

7538
03:11:08,940 --> 03:11:09,773
It's just got to,

7539
03:11:09,780 --> 03:11:09,990

7540
03:11:09,990 --> 03:11:10,141

7541
03:11:10,141 --> 03:11:10,261

7542
03:11:10,261 --> 03:11:10,411

to social media and this is a time,

7545
03:11:15,640 --> 03:11:16,330
excuse me.

7546
03:11:16,330 --> 03:11:18,790
I do not read my social
media once in a blue moon.

7547
03:11:18,791 --> 03:11:19,361
I will did.

7548
03:11:19,361 --> 03:11:20,620
You would have made some corrections

7549
03:11:23,160 --> 03:11:23,993
on that case.

7550
03:11:24,280 --> 03:11:24,491
Hey,

7551
03:11:24,491 --> 03:11:24,981

7552
03:11:24,981 --> 03:11:25,331

7555
03:11:27,520 --> 03:11:27,941
Oh yeah.

7556
03:11:27,941 --> 03:11:28,780
I'm sure it'd be,

7557
03:11:28,840 --> 03:11:29,673
don't touch that.

7558
03:11:30,430 --> 03:11:31,360
Don't touch that.

7559
03:11:31,630 --> 03:11:32,231
You might get high.

7560
03:11:32,231 --> 03:11:33,160
Just looking at some joy.

7561
03:11:33,170 --> 03:11:33,880

03:11:38,140 --> 03:11:39,370
I told you I'm the grill master.

7567
03:11:39,430 --> 03:11:40,121
You say you are,

7568
03:11:40,121 --> 03:11:41,200
but you're using less time.

7569

I killed things.

7575
03:11:52,090 --> 03:11:53,920
You don't have a big brown
Cheddar cheeseburger.

7576
03:11:54,080 --> 03:11:54,371

Only in boiling water.

03:12:29,760 --> 03:12:31,800
Well it depends on the petition.

7598
03:12:31,801 --> 03:12:32,860

I don't have to do it when
you're thinking about no peppers,

7611
03:12:51,441 --> 03:12:52,600
but you don't really have a guy.

7612
03:12:54,130 --> 03:12:55,120
But if I can grill it,

7613
03:12:55,810 --> 03:12:56,650
the peppers,

7614
03:12:56,710 --> 03:12:59,140
I could tell he was fucking line cause
he started grabbing his own beer and it

7615
03:12:59,150 --> 03:12:59,450
was called.

7616
03:12:59,450 --> 03:13:00,530
Yeah I do

7617
03:13:02,110 --> 03:13:03,120
because there was a tiny pause.

7618
03:13:03,121 --> 03:13:03,740
He went,

7619
03:13:03,740 --> 03:13:04,560
I sure do.

7620
03:13:04,560 --> 03:13:05,301
This is the move.

7621
03:13:05,301 --> 03:13:10,090
The move is we have Tom Papa Cook bread
cause he gave me a fucking loaf of sour

7622
03:13:10,091 --> 03:13:10,741
dough bread.

7623
03:13:10,741 --> 03:13:11,660
Here's the media of the day.

7624
03:13:11,920 --> 03:13:14,690
But he baked it in the morning
and I cheated on it that night.

7625
03:13:14,691 --> 03:13:15,080
I had,

7626
03:13:15,080 --> 03:13:17,750
I had bread and butter on it.

7627
03:13:17,780 --> 03:13:18,111
Nope,

7628
03:13:18,111 --> 03:13:18,681
just butter.

7629
03:13:18,681 --> 03:13:19,730
It was outstanding.

7630
03:13:20,130 --> 03:13:21,770
I said at some of it just raw,

7631
03:13:21,771 --> 03:13:23,750
just butter the bread for me,

7632
03:13:23,751 --> 03:13:24,584
but keep going.

7633
03:13:24,680 --> 03:13:25,491
He's very into it,

7634
03:13:25,491 --> 03:13:26,990
but it's because he makes it all himself.

7635
03:13:26,991 --> 03:13:28,550
When I get off from scratch,

7636
03:13:28,551 --> 03:13:29,210
it's so good.

7637
03:13:29,210 --> 03:13:29,331
Oh,

7638
03:13:29,331 --> 03:13:29,901
so this is the,

7639
03:13:29,901 --> 03:13:30,734
this is the idea.

7640
03:13:30,920 --> 03:13:33,650
We'll make some elk burgers
with blue cheese in the middle.

7641
03:13:33,651 --> 03:13:36,630
Pork fat little together as
one and then I flatten out.

7642
03:13:36,660 --> 03:13:39,140
I put blue cheese in the
stature that fold that bitch.

7643
03:13:40,370 --> 03:13:42,980
Fuck you and your catch and
keep calling fucking American.

7644
03:13:42,981 --> 03:13:44,750
What do you mean they'll
catch out with blue cheese,

7645
03:13:44,751 --> 03:13:45,140
bro?

7646
03:13:45,140 --> 03:13:45,770
I grew up,

7647
03:13:45,770 --> 03:13:50,570
I grilled on grilled that bitch and we're
going to put it in between two pieces

7648
03:13:50,571 --> 03:13:51,680
of Tom propers.

7649
03:13:53,990 --> 03:13:56,660
I'm hungry right now so bad.

7650
03:13:56,661 --> 03:13:57,920
My stomach is all cut up,

7651
03:13:58,120 --> 03:14:01,790
shredding fucking hands and
Jalapenos on that motherfucker.

7652
03:14:01,791 --> 03:14:02,181
Of course,

7653
03:14:02,181 --> 03:14:03,140
a little bit of lettuce.

7654
03:14:03,141 --> 03:14:03,974
He wants him left.

7655
03:14:04,400 --> 03:14:04,940
Hey,

7656
03:14:04,940 --> 03:14:08,780
let's have Tom Papa make some nice
fucking French toast and shut his fucking

7657
03:14:08,781 --> 03:14:09,614
mouth.

7658
03:14:10,010 --> 03:14:11,040
French toast would be,

7659
03:14:11,610 --> 03:14:13,800
we got fucked on posts it.

7660
03:14:14,030 --> 03:14:14,810
What happens now?

7661
03:14:14,810 --> 03:14:15,710
You just make the French toast.

7662
03:14:16,780 --> 03:14:17,290
I thought that's it.

7663
03:14:17,290 --> 03:14:18,020
He said,

7664
03:14:18,020 --> 03:14:18,630
no.

7665
03:14:18,630 --> 03:14:19,100
I said,

7666
03:14:19,100 --> 03:14:19,271
no,

7667
03:14:19,271 --> 03:14:21,260
I know that Parker
doesn't fucking delicious.

7668
03:14:21,290 --> 03:14:25,650
I'm talking about straight up American
grilled burgers like beef Burger,

7669
03:14:25,660 --> 03:14:26,493
beef burger.

7670
03:14:26,780 --> 03:14:28,280
I'm going from buffalo too,

7671
03:14:28,281 --> 03:14:29,930
but if you want to go buffalo hunting,

7672
03:14:29,931 --> 03:14:31,310
I'm going this winter,

7673
03:14:31,400 --> 03:14:31,781
I will,

7674
03:14:31,781 --> 03:14:32,750
and John Dudley,

7675
03:14:32,751 --> 03:14:34,040
we're going buffalo hunting.

7676
03:14:34,070 --> 03:14:34,521
Let's do it.

7677
03:14:34,521 --> 03:14:35,354
Can I have a gun?

7678
03:14:36,110 --> 03:14:36,820
You can.

7679
03:14:36,820 --> 03:14:37,970
If you're going to kill
it with a boomerang

7680
03:14:41,030 --> 03:14:42,530
buffalo at that dangerous,

7681
03:14:43,710 --> 03:14:44,500
what?

7682
03:14:44,500 --> 03:14:45,333
What?

7683
03:14:45,630 --> 03:14:46,100
What's,

7684
03:14:46,100 --> 03:14:46,980
they'll charge your base.

7685
03:14:47,000 --> 03:14:50,720
One of the most dangerous things you
could ever hunt it probably more dangerous

7686
03:14:50,721 --> 03:14:55,721
than a bear or they really low 1800 pounds
of swinging dick and I've been around

7687
03:14:57,261 --> 03:14:57,330
them.

7688
03:14:57,330 --> 03:14:58,163
Mellow Bison.

7689
03:14:58,330 --> 03:14:59,060
I'll come at you bro.

7690
03:14:59,060 --> 03:14:59,900
Fucking bison.

7691
03:14:59,980 --> 03:15:01,430
They come out with a cam.

7692
03:15:01,460 --> 03:15:03,590
Haynes just got done a
hunting water buffalo,

7693
03:15:04,400 --> 03:15:05,320
Australia there.

7694
03:15:05,340 --> 03:15:06,173
They're black dots.

7695
03:15:06,540 --> 03:15:08,180
Those are giant and here's the thing,

7696
03:15:08,390 --> 03:15:09,223
their meat,

7697
03:15:09,230 --> 03:15:10,130
you can eat it,

7698
03:15:10,190 --> 03:15:13,720
but it takes so long to chew
because they're just checked.

7699
03:15:13,780 --> 03:15:15,440
The [inaudible] steel,

7700
03:15:15,700 --> 03:15:17,360
you eat the like the back strap,

7701
03:15:17,361 --> 03:15:18,021
which he told us,

7702
03:15:18,021 --> 03:15:18,854
he said,

7703
03:15:22,650 --> 03:15:24,770
when was this thing where this
guy got charged by a bear?

7704
03:15:24,771 --> 03:15:26,690
I saw the video and he
had a bow and arrow.

7705
03:15:26,691 --> 03:15:27,740
I post on Instagram.

7706
03:15:27,980 --> 03:15:29,210
Guys straight up panicked.

7707
03:15:29,230 --> 03:15:29,450
What?

7708
03:15:29,450 --> 03:15:31,030
The beer just left them alone.

7709
03:15:31,070 --> 03:15:31,731
Just jacked him,

7710
03:15:31,731 --> 03:15:32,564
knocked him over,

7711
03:15:32,720 --> 03:15:35,660
running the mode and they're just wants
them to leave them the fuck alone.

7712
03:15:35,840 --> 03:15:38,630
The bear didn't want to eat
like a shade up native American.

7713
03:15:38,920 --> 03:15:39,500
It wasn't.

7714
03:15:39,500 --> 03:15:41,210
Well he was using a recurve bow.

7715
03:15:42,200 --> 03:15:43,640
It's just he fucked up.

7716
03:15:43,641 --> 03:15:46,820
He got charged quick
busted lip or herpes go.

7717
03:15:46,910 --> 03:15:47,301
Oh,

7718
03:15:47,301 --> 03:15:48,134
busted lip.

7719
03:15:48,310 --> 03:15:48,790
A bus,

7720
03:15:48,790 --> 03:15:49,070
lipid.

7721
03:15:49,070 --> 03:15:49,860
Herbie.

7722
03:15:49,860 --> 03:15:50,010
I'd

7723
03:15:50,010 --> 03:15:50,581
say it's herpes,

7724
03:15:50,581 --> 03:15:51,070
but who cares?

7725
03:15:51,070 --> 03:15:51,780
Listen man,

7726
03:15:51,780 --> 03:15:52,830
I'm going to say it's a busted lip.

7727
03:15:53,970 --> 03:15:55,360
Rather look like this.

7728
03:15:55,550 --> 03:15:57,150
However things get weird in there.

7729
03:15:57,180 --> 03:16:01,080
I guess that's a very round busted lip.

7730
03:16:01,081 --> 03:16:04,080
That's a brown perfectly
symmetrical round hurt

7731
03:16:05,850 --> 03:16:06,451
like a motherfucker.

7732
03:16:06,451 --> 03:16:06,901
It's all good.

7733
03:16:06,901 --> 03:16:07,770
I get those sometimes.

7734
03:16:07,830 --> 03:16:09,180
Do you remember when,

7735
03:16:09,230 --> 03:16:09,620
um,

7736
03:16:09,620 --> 03:16:12,270
chocolate Liddell fought rich
Franklin and his lip got split?

7737
03:16:12,330 --> 03:16:13,163
Yes.

7738
03:16:14,520 --> 03:16:14,761
Yeah.

7739
03:16:14,761 --> 03:16:15,594
It was crazy.

7740
03:16:15,750 --> 03:16:16,240
Powerful.

7741
03:16:16,240 --> 03:16:17,073
Retrained.

7742
03:16:17,130 --> 03:16:17,371
Yeah.

7743
03:16:17,371 --> 03:16:18,270
It was a crazy,

7744
03:16:18,450 --> 03:16:19,320
crazy split lip.

7745
03:16:19,500 --> 03:16:21,300
So Franklin just sort of stepped away.

7746
03:16:21,301 --> 03:16:22,890
He never really officially retired.

7747
03:16:23,160 --> 03:16:24,210
He just stepped back.

7748
03:16:24,300 --> 03:16:24,811
It was just like,

7749
03:16:24,811 --> 03:16:25,000
you know,

7750
03:16:25,000 --> 03:16:26,450
I'm a chill for a little bit split.

7751
03:16:26,820 --> 03:16:28,620
But then it wasn't like
a big announcement,

7752
03:16:28,621 --> 03:16:30,900
like guys weren't doing
it like they are now.

7753
03:16:31,100 --> 03:16:31,900
Then you went to warn us.

7754
03:16:31,900 --> 03:16:32,131
See.

7755
03:16:32,131 --> 03:16:32,350
Right.

7756
03:16:32,350 --> 03:16:32,850
It might be hard,

7757
03:16:32,850 --> 03:16:33,331
but let's see.

7758
03:16:33,331 --> 03:16:34,170
That looks like a herpes.

7759
03:16:34,240 --> 03:16:34,890
Me.

7760
03:16:34,890 --> 03:16:35,640
You might be right.

7761
03:16:35,640 --> 03:16:36,031
It's all good.

7762
03:16:36,031 --> 03:16:36,631
He's a married man.

7763
03:16:36,631 --> 03:16:36,741
That's,

7764
03:16:36,741 --> 03:16:37,441
that's all good.

7765
03:16:37,441 --> 03:16:38,180
That's a big strong,

7766
03:16:38,180 --> 03:16:39,013
it's stress.

7767
03:16:39,200 --> 03:16:40,330
Could be an elbow though.

7768
03:16:41,470 --> 03:16:42,810
Fuck around with chicken head.

7769
03:16:42,840 --> 03:16:43,450
Who knows?

7770
03:16:43,450 --> 03:16:44,283
Sure.

7771
03:16:47,520 --> 03:16:50,030
What about the gravy gravy?

7772
03:16:51,300 --> 03:16:52,320
Still a hero.

7773
03:16:52,530 --> 03:16:53,160
Herpes or no,

7774
03:16:53,160 --> 03:16:53,351
here.

7775
03:16:53,351 --> 03:16:54,340
A bad mother fucker.

7776
03:16:54,990 --> 03:16:56,220
Gustafson's bad motherfucker.

7777
03:16:56,370 --> 03:16:59,010
He emerged as one of the most exciting
guys in the division right there.

7778
03:16:59,290 --> 03:17:00,270
He's motivated now.

7779
03:17:00,570 --> 03:17:00,871
Yeah,

7780
03:17:00,871 --> 03:17:01,260
man.

7781
03:17:01,260 --> 03:17:02,580
Especially with a wife and kid.

7782
03:17:02,850 --> 03:17:03,180
Yeah.

7783
03:17:03,180 --> 03:17:04,810
What's her name is standing
on an apple box right now,

7784
03:17:04,811 --> 03:17:05,910
I guarantee you.

7785
03:17:06,110 --> 03:17:06,943
She is.

7786
03:17:07,830 --> 03:17:08,011
Yeah.

7787
03:17:08,011 --> 03:17:09,330
She's tiny and he's giant.

7788
03:17:09,780 --> 03:17:10,500
Um,

7789
03:17:10,500 --> 03:17:10,750
this,

7790
03:17:10,750 --> 03:17:10,960
uh,

7791
03:17:10,960 --> 03:17:11,430
those,

7792
03:17:11,430 --> 03:17:12,840
there's a lot of good fights to be made.

7793
03:17:12,841 --> 03:17:16,670
Madden's a lot of good fights to be made
and a lot of guys are going to transit

7794
03:17:16,710 --> 03:17:17,543
UFC training.

7795
03:17:17,860 --> 03:17:20,430
They probably not one person there.

7796
03:17:20,490 --> 03:17:21,323
You.

7797
03:17:21,370 --> 03:17:21,720
Dot.

7798
03:17:21,720 --> 03:17:21,961
Yeah.

7799
03:17:21,961 --> 03:17:23,230
I don't think they didn't want me in jail.

7800
03:17:23,231 --> 03:17:23,760
They'll let you in.

7801
03:17:23,760 --> 03:17:24,570
I don't know.

7802
03:17:24,570 --> 03:17:26,520
How do they feel about what
they tweeted me the other day,

7803
03:17:26,521 --> 03:17:26,851
so I'm like,

7804
03:17:26,851 --> 03:17:27,090
you know,

7805
03:17:27,090 --> 03:17:29,060
we might be cool some social media kit.

7806
03:17:29,061 --> 03:17:30,120
It's probably fired now.

7807
03:17:30,180 --> 03:17:31,270
They're probably flogged them around.

7808
03:17:31,300 --> 03:17:32,060
He's dead.

7809
03:17:32,060 --> 03:17:32,980
He probably went missing.

7810
03:17:33,030 --> 03:17:34,500
He hit him with a wet belt.

7811
03:17:34,800 --> 03:17:36,330
Slack right across the ass.

7812
03:17:36,390 --> 03:17:37,040
Take your water.

7813
03:17:37,040 --> 03:17:38,730
They probably waterboarded
on or some shit.

7814
03:17:40,110 --> 03:17:41,570
He probably just didn't know this.

7815
03:17:41,571 --> 03:17:42,580
Brennan Sharp retweet.

7816
03:17:43,260 --> 03:17:44,190
Here's the problem.

7817
03:17:44,280 --> 03:17:48,810
As your celebrity grows and as the
fighter and the kid continues to grow,

7818
03:17:48,840 --> 03:17:53,840
it is going to emerge if it hasn't
already gotten there as one of the biggest

7819
03:17:53,851 --> 03:17:56,010
sports shows the world has ever known.

7820
03:17:56,400 --> 03:17:58,650
I mean you guys have
millions of downloads.

7821
03:17:58,651 --> 03:18:02,130
When you look at the amount of downloads
you guys have and you look at the

7822
03:18:02,131 --> 03:18:04,740
influence that you guys have
and how many people listen,

7823
03:18:05,430 --> 03:18:07,740
like they'd be crazy to
not jump on board with you.

7824
03:18:08,190 --> 03:18:08,401
Yeah,

7825
03:18:08,401 --> 03:18:09,690
I mean the big brown breakdown,

7826
03:18:09,840 --> 03:18:11,680
which is an all fight show is there.

7827
03:18:11,681 --> 03:18:14,480
I mean bigger than any
show there as far as I'm,

7828
03:18:14,481 --> 03:18:15,310
it may not,

7829
03:18:15,310 --> 03:18:16,170
not the fight can pain,

7830
03:18:16,171 --> 03:18:17,680
but as far as straight up fight shows,

7831
03:18:17,681 --> 03:18:18,514
sports shows,

7832
03:18:18,630 --> 03:18:21,780
it's the biggest one that his last
fight companion we did got 10 million

7833
03:18:21,781 --> 03:18:22,350
downloads.

7834
03:18:22,350 --> 03:18:23,183
God,

7835
03:18:23,410 --> 03:18:27,570
when we talk to you about fucking
flat earth and talking in that one,

7836
03:18:27,600 --> 03:18:27,931
wasn't it?

7837
03:18:27,931 --> 03:18:28,670
That one.

7838
03:18:28,670 --> 03:18:31,920
What was the flatter with one is the
one where you kind of got him daddy.

7839
03:18:32,080 --> 03:18:32,913
It might've been that.

7840
03:18:32,970 --> 03:18:37,770
I found that actually very interesting
what people think I like some issue with,

7841
03:18:37,771 --> 03:18:38,950
I have zero issue with Yossi.

7842
03:18:38,970 --> 03:18:39,570
I'm over him.

7843
03:18:39,570 --> 03:18:39,900
I mean,

7844
03:18:39,900 --> 03:18:40,141
yeah,

7845
03:18:40,141 --> 03:18:41,180
I think there are over too.

7846
03:18:41,310 --> 03:18:42,150
I love the UFC.

7847
03:18:42,270 --> 03:18:44,550
I'm doing a one fight deal with
Belotero for this big mask.

7848
03:18:44,580 --> 03:18:44,960
Where,

7849
03:18:44,960 --> 03:18:45,320
what,

7850
03:18:45,320 --> 03:18:45,550
what,

7851
03:18:45,550 --> 03:18:45,721
what,

7852
03:18:45,721 --> 03:18:45,920
what,

7853
03:18:45,920 --> 03:18:46,420
what?

7854
03:18:46,420 --> 03:18:48,040
Why does it a little teeny Jake

7855
03:18:48,040 --> 03:18:49,660
for a financial New York?

7856
03:18:49,661 --> 03:18:51,340
What are you doing on business?

7857
03:18:51,700 --> 03:18:52,750
Have you made this announcement?

7858
03:18:53,200 --> 03:18:58,030
I am now that square garden
breakdowns on there it is.

7859
03:18:58,031 --> 03:18:58,540
Wow.

7860
03:18:58,540 --> 03:19:02,410
I'm at a June 22nd Gotham Comedy Club
in New York for the big round breakdown

7861
03:19:02,440 --> 03:19:02,890
live.

7862
03:19:02,890 --> 03:19:03,220
Right,

7863
03:19:03,220 --> 03:19:08,220
and then on the 24th 25th I'm working
for spike doing TV stuff for the shit.

7864
03:19:09,370 --> 03:19:10,360
Just a one fight deal.

7865
03:19:10,480 --> 03:19:11,111
Listen man.

7866
03:19:11,111 --> 03:19:15,230
What spike is doing right now with
having world class talent in Beltour

7867
03:19:15,320 --> 03:19:16,153
kickboxing,

7868
03:19:16,270 --> 03:19:18,190
worldclass kickboxer
some of the best world,

7869
03:19:18,340 --> 03:19:19,420
Giorgio Petrosyan,

7870
03:19:19,450 --> 03:19:20,440
John Wayne par.

7871
03:19:20,650 --> 03:19:23,360
I mean some of the best fucking kickbox
is in the world are fighting on Bella

7872
03:19:23,361 --> 03:19:23,890
door.

7873
03:19:23,890 --> 03:19:25,140
Then you sign it.

7874
03:19:25,141 --> 03:19:26,050
Rory Macdonald,

7875
03:19:26,410 --> 03:19:29,230
Lorens Larkin fade or big country now,

7876
03:19:29,320 --> 03:19:30,153
big country.

7877
03:19:30,400 --> 03:19:33,430
I mean they already have Douglas Lema,

7878
03:19:33,640 --> 03:19:33,881
you know,

7879
03:19:33,881 --> 03:19:35,090
they already have Michael Chandler.

7880
03:19:35,150 --> 03:19:36,880
They've got some serious fucking talent.

7881
03:19:37,060 --> 03:19:38,800
They just a real opportunity
for them to take,

7882
03:19:39,010 --> 03:19:40,030
take that market share.

7883
03:19:40,060 --> 03:19:41,320
They got to get rid of that lame name.

7884
03:19:41,740 --> 03:19:42,970
Peloton Peloton.

7885
03:19:43,420 --> 03:19:45,670
I don't know why they
keep get rid of that.

7886
03:19:45,671 --> 03:19:46,390
Right.

7887
03:19:46,390 --> 03:19:47,223
What would they call it?

7888
03:19:47,290 --> 03:19:48,820
Just spike MMA,

7889
03:19:48,970 --> 03:19:50,320
but they're not going to be spike anymore.

7890
03:19:50,500 --> 03:19:51,430
It's going to be something new.

7891
03:19:51,760 --> 03:19:53,620
I think 2018 they change.

7892
03:19:54,370 --> 03:19:55,810
I think spike TV is changing its name.

7893
03:19:56,020 --> 03:19:56,853
Just changed the name.

7894
03:19:57,260 --> 03:19:57,490
Yeah.

7895
03:19:57,490 --> 03:19:59,280
I think it's like the
paramount station or something.

7896
03:19:59,320 --> 03:20:00,310
What is the ultimate,

7897
03:20:01,090 --> 03:20:01,840
what do they,

7898
03:20:01,840 --> 03:20:02,980
let's find out what they're calling it.

7899
03:20:03,230 --> 03:20:03,460
They're,

7900
03:20:03,460 --> 03:20:04,410
I think they're gonna change.

7901
03:20:04,530 --> 03:20:04,930
I think they're,

7902
03:20:04,930 --> 03:20:08,560
I think they are literally changing the
name is that is paramount in that we're

7903
03:20:08,570 --> 03:20:08,730
here,

7904
03:20:08,730 --> 03:20:09,490
mount fight low.

7905
03:20:09,490 --> 03:20:11,020
I got my foam on the Pauls.

7906
03:20:11,110 --> 03:20:12,030
Hollywood shows.

7907
03:20:12,340 --> 03:20:15,700
Very few people that are in Hollywood
that know less about Hollywood than me.

7908
03:20:15,730 --> 03:20:16,240
Yes.

7909
03:20:16,240 --> 03:20:16,960
But you knew that.

7910
03:20:16,960 --> 03:20:18,700
I knew that we bring in a hot new,

7911
03:20:18,701 --> 03:20:20,770
that paramount fight leaks.

7912
03:20:20,771 --> 03:20:21,604
Pretty cool.

7913
03:20:21,670 --> 03:20:22,390
Yeah.

7914
03:20:22,390 --> 03:20:23,020
Um,

7915
03:20:23,020 --> 03:20:23,800
you know,

7916
03:20:23,800 --> 03:20:24,370
fire me,

7917
03:20:24,370 --> 03:20:25,120
give some kind of,

7918
03:20:25,120 --> 03:20:26,110
it's just MMA.

7919
03:20:26,140 --> 03:20:26,980
Just call it MMA.

7920
03:20:27,010 --> 03:20:28,420
Just like when you go to see boxing,

7921
03:20:28,421 --> 03:20:29,470
you're not seeing like,

7922
03:20:29,770 --> 03:20:30,101
you know,

7923
03:20:30,101 --> 03:20:30,630
fucking,

7924
03:20:30,630 --> 03:20:31,590
but you're going to have a mic.

7925
03:20:31,830 --> 03:20:32,590
Showtime,

7926
03:20:32,590 --> 03:20:33,341
Hbo.

7927
03:20:33,341 --> 03:20:33,551
Right,

7928
03:20:33,551 --> 03:20:34,180
right.

7929
03:20:34,180 --> 03:20:35,320
But it's HBO boxing.

7930
03:20:35,321 --> 03:20:37,020
Showtime fight night are paramount.

7931
03:20:37,030 --> 03:20:37,863
Fight night,

7932
03:20:38,350 --> 03:20:40,840
paramount Nmai hape
review two or whatever.

7933
03:20:40,841 --> 03:20:41,470
Yeah.

7934
03:20:41,470 --> 03:20:46,470
And MMA has enough of a name now that I
think you can like everyone knows UFC is

7935
03:20:46,571 --> 03:20:48,160
always going to be like NFL,

7936
03:20:48,410 --> 03:20:49,360
like NBA.

7937
03:20:49,361 --> 03:20:50,350
It's going to plead find.

7938
03:20:50,690 --> 03:20:52,240
It defines Q tips.

7939
03:20:52,630 --> 03:20:53,410
Right,

7940
03:20:53,410 --> 03:20:55,330
but I'll tell you what I do
like with the UFC is doing.

7941
03:20:55,331 --> 03:20:56,620
I don't like that it's on fight pass.

7942
03:20:56,621 --> 03:20:57,700
I think that's a terrible idea.

7943
03:20:57,701 --> 03:21:01,120
But the data lights contender series
every Thursday night there's like five

7944
03:21:01,121 --> 03:21:01,900
fights of luck.

7945
03:21:01,900 --> 03:21:04,000
Upcoming guys to build up new guys.

7946
03:21:04,150 --> 03:21:04,610
Yeah.

7947
03:21:04,610 --> 03:21:05,500
What's on fight pass?

7948
03:21:05,501 --> 03:21:06,640
We're only the balls.

7949
03:21:06,641 --> 03:21:08,110
Deep hardcore fans see it.

7950
03:21:08,350 --> 03:21:09,820
That should be on Fox sports one,

7951
03:21:09,821 --> 03:21:11,140
they need content like a motherfucker.

7952
03:21:11,410 --> 03:21:12,730
I came on Fox sport,

7953
03:21:12,820 --> 03:21:13,720
the pregame,

7954
03:21:13,990 --> 03:21:18,280
they had Bisbing and Gilbert Melendez
guessing the capitals of Europe for 30

7955
03:21:18,281 --> 03:21:18,770
minutes.

7956
03:21:18,770 --> 03:21:19,603
That's important.

7957
03:21:20,920 --> 03:21:24,160
Not to freak the fuck guessing
the capitals of Europe.

7958
03:21:24,161 --> 03:21:24,990
The fuck it was.

7959
03:21:24,990 --> 03:21:25,823
God.

7960
03:21:25,840 --> 03:21:28,630
This is the thing about live sports.

7961
03:21:29,080 --> 03:21:32,470
This the only thing that
makes TV valuable these days.

7962
03:21:32,580 --> 03:21:35,830
The only thing if you
take away live sports,

7963
03:21:36,160 --> 03:21:38,020
nobody's watching sitcoms anymore.

7964
03:21:38,021 --> 03:21:39,820
The numbers have dropped radically.

7965
03:21:40,000 --> 03:21:40,421
Nobody's,

7966
03:21:40,421 --> 03:21:40,990
I mean there's,

7967
03:21:40,990 --> 03:21:43,210
there's a few people
watching those cop dramas,

7968
03:21:43,211 --> 03:21:45,320
those CSI shows is this people,

7969
03:21:45,321 --> 03:21:46,460
it was brain dead.

7970
03:21:46,461 --> 03:21:48,410
People in the Midwest is
sitting in front of the TV.

7971
03:21:49,120 --> 03:21:49,730
Rhonda,

7972
03:21:49,730 --> 03:21:51,230
that's the bad guy.

7973
03:21:51,530 --> 03:21:53,060
Cause you get a car.

7974
03:21:53,450 --> 03:21:54,790
I was going to get caught.

7975
03:21:54,800 --> 03:21:56,380
That's a terrible character.

7976
03:21:57,160 --> 03:21:58,380
How could that character,

7977
03:21:58,460 --> 03:21:59,500
this is my shower,

7978
03:21:59,570 --> 03:22:00,510
this is my show.

7979
03:22:00,530 --> 03:22:02,690
Csi My show,

7980
03:22:05,570 --> 03:22:06,403
some

7981
03:22:07,370 --> 03:22:11,270
soda water drinking Dr
Pepper Chips and shit.

7982
03:22:11,570 --> 03:22:12,620
But I think that um,

7983
03:22:13,490 --> 03:22:14,840
those shows are dropping off.

7984
03:22:14,840 --> 03:22:17,630
Like if you look at like Hbo,

7985
03:22:17,780 --> 03:22:19,490
the shows that they put together,

7986
03:22:19,491 --> 03:22:22,550
the show is showtime puts together
the shows Netflix put together.

7987
03:22:22,551 --> 03:22:25,490
They're just superior thought and
not interrupted by commercial,

7988
03:22:26,480 --> 03:22:28,240
especially the episodes and all that.

7989
03:22:28,241 --> 03:22:28,401
Yeah.

7990
03:22:28,401 --> 03:22:32,510
So the big thing for
television is live sports.

7991
03:22:32,750 --> 03:22:33,583
Like a fight.

7992
03:22:33,590 --> 03:22:35,510
Like we came here to watch television.

7993
03:22:35,511 --> 03:22:37,580
We came here to watch
a live fighting event.

7994
03:22:38,120 --> 03:22:38,401
I mean,

7995
03:22:38,401 --> 03:22:40,010
the live sporting events are like,

7996
03:22:40,040 --> 03:22:40,731
in my opinion,

7997
03:22:40,731 --> 03:22:42,440
the premier thing on television now.

7998
03:22:42,920 --> 03:22:44,630
It's really the only reason
why you'd have cable,

7999
03:22:44,631 --> 03:22:45,464
to be honest.

8000
03:22:45,710 --> 03:22:46,531
For a lot of kids,

8001
03:22:46,531 --> 03:22:47,570
everything else you can get.

8002
03:22:47,600 --> 03:22:48,620
Jamie's generation.

8003
03:22:48,621 --> 03:22:49,490
These youngsters,

8004
03:22:49,520 --> 03:22:51,290
they're all abandoning their cable.

8005
03:22:51,320 --> 03:22:54,920
They're all turning off their direct
TV and just watching their computers.

8006
03:22:54,950 --> 03:22:55,101
Yeah,

8007
03:22:55,101 --> 03:22:56,300
they're just getting at Netflix.

8008
03:22:56,590 --> 03:22:56,750
Well,

8009
03:22:56,750 --> 03:22:58,320
youtube red now has its own,

8010
03:22:58,340 --> 03:22:58,960
its own,

8011
03:22:58,960 --> 03:23:00,800
you know they have the TV shows on there.

8012
03:23:00,800 --> 03:23:01,840
They're getting movies.

8013
03:23:01,910 --> 03:23:02,160
Yeah.

8014
03:23:02,160 --> 03:23:05,000
They're going to be able to air television
shows that are on television right

8015
03:23:05,001 --> 03:23:06,470
now on youtube.

8016
03:23:07,070 --> 03:23:08,000
My TV,

8017
03:23:08,030 --> 03:23:13,030
I got a TV at home and it plays Netflix
from the TV without an apple TV with it.

8018
03:23:13,540 --> 03:23:13,970
Right.

8019
03:23:13,970 --> 03:23:15,140
Comes with Netflix.

8020
03:23:15,170 --> 03:23:16,003
It's in there.

8021
03:23:16,130 --> 03:23:18,530
So literally all you need
to do now if you're a kid.

8022
03:23:18,680 --> 03:23:18,831
Yeah.

8023
03:23:18,831 --> 03:23:20,150
You have an internet connection.

8024
03:23:20,270 --> 03:23:21,050
You have a TV.

8025
03:23:21,050 --> 03:23:24,590
What do you watch TV wise
on that house of cards.

8026
03:23:24,860 --> 03:23:25,693
I got to watch that.

8027
03:23:25,730 --> 03:23:26,563
It's good.

8028
03:23:26,690 --> 03:23:27,590
She's so good.

8029
03:23:27,620 --> 03:23:31,790
The new season starts at
the end of this month.

8030
03:23:31,940 --> 03:23:34,740
I saw a Robin Wright and person
at the one on one woman from air.

8031
03:23:34,741 --> 03:23:36,650
She's probably like 49 I
don't know how old she is.

8032
03:23:36,651 --> 03:23:38,270
80 she looks so unbelievable.

8033
03:23:38,660 --> 03:23:39,860
It's so fucking good.

8034
03:23:39,861 --> 03:23:40,550
Would you do it?

8035
03:23:40,550 --> 03:23:40,821
Yeah,

8036
03:23:40,821 --> 03:23:45,821
100% 100% and you can give everybody
at events and lose friends on the way.

8037
03:23:46,910 --> 03:23:49,340
Do you think you'd have a chance if she
saw your act or do you think you'd have

8038
03:23:49,341 --> 03:23:50,270
to go back to acting?

8039
03:23:50,510 --> 03:23:50,900
Uh,

8040
03:23:50,900 --> 03:23:52,610
if she's on my act that Alex had a chance,

8041
03:23:53,690 --> 03:23:55,180
I'm discerning this room.

8042
03:23:55,340 --> 03:23:55,491
Yeah,

8043
03:23:55,491 --> 03:23:59,210
but do you think she would be caught
dead with a comedian while she'd have to

8044
03:23:59,211 --> 03:24:00,044
come to my show?

8045
03:24:00,110 --> 03:24:00,943
I don't know.

8046
03:24:01,010 --> 03:24:02,570
Ninth and 10th Brow.

8047
03:24:02,870 --> 03:24:03,591
Maybe she will.

8048
03:24:03,591 --> 03:24:05,930
What if she shows up and sits in the
front right where she fucked you up?

8049
03:24:05,990 --> 03:24:08,870
[inaudible] fuck you
up to my boss at first,

8050
03:24:08,900 --> 03:24:12,260
if she kept crossing and uncrossing their
legs and she was wearing one of those

8051
03:24:12,261 --> 03:24:13,280
clear Underwood skirts,

8052
03:24:13,300 --> 03:24:14,133
I have a problem.

8053
03:24:14,550 --> 03:24:16,040
She has a beautiful warm be.

8054
03:24:16,390 --> 03:24:17,600
She was Jenny and Forrest Gump.

8055
03:24:18,230 --> 03:24:18,321
Oh,

8056
03:24:18,321 --> 03:24:18,800
that's right.

8057
03:24:18,800 --> 03:24:19,640
I um,

8058
03:24:19,670 --> 03:24:23,170
sometimes I'll have like Nate Diaz came
to my show in San Diego and I was Kinda,

8059
03:24:23,350 --> 03:24:24,440
I was cramped about that.

8060
03:24:24,590 --> 03:24:24,741
Yeah.

8061
03:24:24,741 --> 03:24:25,430
She look at her.

8062
03:24:25,430 --> 03:24:25,850
She's,

8063
03:24:25,850 --> 03:24:27,160
she looks so good.

8064
03:24:27,161 --> 03:24:28,130
He's well taken care of.

8065
03:24:28,131 --> 03:24:28,760
She's beautiful.

8066
03:24:28,760 --> 03:24:29,593
Wow.

8067
03:24:30,730 --> 03:24:31,070
Yeah,

8068
03:24:31,070 --> 03:24:31,700
she's cute.

8069
03:24:31,700 --> 03:24:32,090
She is.

8070
03:24:32,090 --> 03:24:32,811
She from.

8071
03:24:32,811 --> 03:24:33,540
I knew her for,

8072
03:24:33,540 --> 03:24:35,040
she was in princess bride first.

8073
03:24:35,390 --> 03:24:36,320
Too Young for that shit.

8074
03:24:36,350 --> 03:24:36,531
No,

8075
03:24:36,531 --> 03:24:37,364
there's something else.

8076
03:24:37,520 --> 03:24:38,600
I thought she was genuine.

8077
03:24:38,601 --> 03:24:39,434
Forrest Gump.

8078
03:24:40,430 --> 03:24:41,263
Forrest Gump.

8079
03:24:41,630 --> 03:24:42,140
Jenny.

8080
03:24:42,140 --> 03:24:44,490
She was out fucking cut in that movie,

8081
03:24:45,050 --> 03:24:45,883
Dude.

8082
03:24:45,970 --> 03:24:46,380
She,

8083
03:24:46,380 --> 03:24:47,213
she,

8084
03:24:49,030 --> 03:24:52,590
she dictates that entire fucking movie.

8085
03:24:52,890 --> 03:24:55,290
And then finally she gets aids.

8086
03:24:56,790 --> 03:24:58,460
Let's do it for she supposed to do.

8087
03:24:58,461 --> 03:25:02,790
She supposed to hang around with
this fucking half a mongoloid fuck

8088
03:25:05,550 --> 03:25:06,383
trip.

8089
03:25:06,410 --> 03:25:06,680
Oh,

8090
03:25:06,680 --> 03:25:08,550
he's fucking real good at ping pong.

8091
03:25:08,610 --> 03:25:08,821
No,

8092
03:25:08,821 --> 03:25:10,720
fuck you let them into my pussy.

8093
03:25:10,740 --> 03:25:12,780
Real guest limping.

8094
03:25:12,781 --> 03:25:14,100
You fuck works.

8095
03:25:14,240 --> 03:25:15,030
He's an Olympian.

8096
03:25:15,030 --> 03:25:15,570
Jesus.

8097
03:25:15,570 --> 03:25:17,280
She saw saying use the c word.

8098
03:25:17,370 --> 03:25:20,300
He's a fucking my girl now she's up.

8099
03:25:20,330 --> 03:25:21,000
She was a horn.

8100
03:25:21,000 --> 03:25:21,411
That movie.

8101
03:25:21,411 --> 03:25:21,640
Hey,

8102
03:25:21,640 --> 03:25:22,870
I will fight you right now.

8103
03:25:23,100 --> 03:25:28,100
The guitar naked and then just cocked my
boy for and you to take this shit back

I will come at you in this room

8107

8118
03:25:53,190 --> 03:25:54,840

8119
03:25:54,960 --> 03:25:55,620

8120
03:25:55,620 --> 03:25:56,453

8121
03:25:56,470 --> 03:25:58,140

8131
03:26:12,450 --> 03:26:13,380
You know what he was in?

8132
03:26:13,470 --> 03:26:14,970
He was in 30 days of night.

8133
03:26:14,971 --> 03:26:15,804

That scared the shit out of here.

8140
03:26:27,540 --> 03:26:29,850

vampires are good vampires.

8141
03:26:30,000 --> 03:26:31,080
That movie was so good.

8147
03:26:40,830 --> 03:26:42,120
I saw him in Utah with his,

8148
03:26:42,121 --> 03:26:43,770

8149
03:26:43,770 --> 03:26:44,440

Very nice guy.

8153
03:26:47,201 --> 03:26:48,710

8158
03:26:55,111 --> 03:26:55,291

8159
03:26:55,291 --> 03:26:56,124

I love your word.

8163
03:26:58,430 --> 03:26:59,640
Sex in the city is your standup.

8164
03:26:59,641 --> 03:27:00,151
It's amazing.

8165
03:27:00,151 --> 03:27:01,790
Fuck Cujo whatever.

8166
03:27:02,970 --> 03:27:03,810
Fucking low blow,

8167
03:27:03,811 --> 03:27:04,170
Bro.

8168
03:27:04,170 --> 03:27:05,120
Why is it a little brown?

8169
03:27:05,130 --> 03:27:05,963
It's a good question.

8170
03:27:06,130 --> 03:27:06,950
What's your question?

8171
03:27:06,950 --> 03:27:08,040
I think that's a bad women.

8172
03:27:08,041 --> 03:27:08,341
Women,

8173
03:27:08,341 --> 03:27:09,174
women ask me,

8174
03:27:09,480 --> 03:27:11,040
what's wrong with you in sex in the city?

8175
03:27:11,041 --> 03:27:11,761
That was a big deal.

8176
03:27:11,761 --> 03:27:14,900
I was just a long time
ago and now I'm insecure,

8177
03:27:14,920 --> 03:27:15,080
Bro.

8178
03:27:15,080 --> 03:27:15,540
I told you,

8179
03:27:15,540 --> 03:27:16,680
I don't know why guys,

8180
03:27:16,770 --> 03:27:18,870
if I don't get home and
start firing up this grill.

8181
03:27:18,920 --> 03:27:19,261
All right,

8182
03:27:19,261 --> 03:27:19,961
let's take it over.

8183
03:27:19,961 --> 03:27:22,380
You got to press a button
so I ain't even a real grip.

8184
03:27:22,460 --> 03:27:22,860
Meanwhile,

8185
03:27:22,860 --> 03:27:23,730
I use a pellet grill

8186
03:27:25,590 --> 03:27:27,630
but pellet grill because Pella,

8187
03:27:27,990 --> 03:27:29,280
you cook with wood.

8188
03:27:29,640 --> 03:27:30,030
It's,

8189
03:27:30,030 --> 03:27:30,610
it's actual,

8190
03:27:30,610 --> 03:27:33,050
what's 2017 there they are.

8191
03:27:33,051 --> 03:27:34,980
The gates on 2017

8192
03:27:36,550 --> 03:27:38,480
what gets into the military
drills to the best.

8193
03:27:38,560 --> 03:27:40,200
They cook with smoke.

8194
03:27:40,201 --> 03:27:41,300
You smell the burning,

8195
03:27:42,030 --> 03:27:43,540
like miss smoky.

8196
03:27:43,660 --> 03:27:43,911
Yeah.

8197
03:27:43,911 --> 03:27:45,670
I like that shit about
these pellet grills.

8198
03:27:45,760 --> 03:27:46,780
I know shit about cheese.

8199
03:27:46,781 --> 03:27:47,770
It's all about the cheese.

8200
03:27:47,771 --> 03:27:49,180
You have to sharp English,

8201
03:27:49,181 --> 03:27:50,014
cheddar cheese,

8202
03:27:50,170 --> 03:27:52,090
cheddar cheese from England
or way over your head.

8203
03:27:52,390 --> 03:27:52,601
No,

8204
03:27:52,601 --> 03:27:52,730
no,

8205
03:27:52,730 --> 03:27:53,230
no.

8206
03:27:53,230 --> 03:27:55,510
When it comes to like
smoking exotic meat and shit.

8207
03:27:55,660 --> 03:27:55,901
Fuck.

8208
03:27:55,901 --> 03:27:57,430
I'm reverse sear in food.

8209
03:27:58,300 --> 03:28:01,330
I'm cooking slow at two 75
with a meat thermometer.

8210
03:28:01,440 --> 03:28:02,910
Breach you motherfucker.

8211
03:28:02,950 --> 03:28:03,651
It's about the meet,

8212
03:28:03,651 --> 03:28:04,090
sir.

8213
03:28:04,090 --> 03:28:05,590
I'm all about Cherry Wood.

8214
03:28:05,970 --> 03:28:06,990
I'm using a lot of chairs.

8215
03:28:07,190 --> 03:28:08,020
How about you?

8216
03:28:08,020 --> 03:28:08,853
Oh,

8217
03:28:09,580 --> 03:28:09,941
I get it.

8218
03:28:09,941 --> 03:28:12,100
You're going to be cooking
shows in like some OPEC Shit.

8219
03:28:12,120 --> 03:28:12,970
Don't make no food.

8220
03:28:13,240 --> 03:28:14,140
I'm not going to say skin.

8221
03:28:14,350 --> 03:28:16,390
When it comes down to
traditional American hotdogs,

8222
03:28:16,391 --> 03:28:17,224
cheeseburgers.

8223
03:28:17,380 --> 03:28:17,741
See me,

8224
03:28:17,741 --> 03:28:18,040
bro.

8225
03:28:18,040 --> 03:28:18,873
Come at me.

8226
03:28:19,340 --> 03:28:20,650
And you're supporting terrorism.

8227
03:28:20,680 --> 03:28:21,280
Way to go.

8228
03:28:21,280 --> 03:28:24,130
Your food smells like it's
cooked by your exhaust pipe.

8229
03:28:24,160 --> 03:28:25,060
Your fucking Bentley.

8230
03:28:25,170 --> 03:28:25,600
Yeah.

8231
03:28:25,600 --> 03:28:26,890
So it tastes like using gas,

8232
03:28:26,891 --> 03:28:27,161
Bro,

8233
03:28:27,161 --> 03:28:28,450
and keeping us gas dependent.

8234
03:28:28,600 --> 03:28:29,170
Hey Joe.

8235
03:28:29,170 --> 03:28:30,370
Thanks for using Cherry Wood.

8236
03:28:30,400 --> 03:28:30,730
Yeah,

8237
03:28:30,730 --> 03:28:31,600
I'm on your side.

8238
03:28:31,810 --> 03:28:32,381
You're not eating.

8239
03:28:32,381 --> 03:28:33,460
You're fucking your approach shot,

8240
03:28:33,461 --> 03:28:34,000
Bro.

8241
03:28:34,000 --> 03:28:34,833
You don't even know.

8242
03:28:35,380 --> 03:28:36,580
I like Trump did.

8243
03:28:36,581 --> 03:28:37,240
Yeah,

8244
03:28:37,240 --> 03:28:38,073
for real.

8245
03:28:38,140 --> 03:28:38,973
No,

8246
03:28:39,700 --> 03:28:40,210
don't do it.

8247
03:28:40,210 --> 03:28:41,043
They'll come at you like,

8248
03:28:41,920 --> 03:28:42,550
look what happened.

8249
03:28:42,550 --> 03:28:43,031
Kanye.

8250
03:28:43,031 --> 03:28:44,320
He went into a mental hospital,

8251
03:28:44,380 --> 03:28:45,170
they take go crazy.

8252
03:28:45,170 --> 03:28:47,590
Went pro Trump and they put them
right in the fucking loony bin.

8253
03:28:47,770 --> 03:28:48,880
I like,

8254
03:28:50,500 --> 03:28:54,010
I liked what he said with the terrorists
in Manchester when they asked him,

8255
03:28:54,011 --> 03:28:55,040
cause you don't expect the president.

8256
03:28:55,041 --> 03:28:56,320
It says cause they're losers,

8257
03:28:56,560 --> 03:28:57,191
they're losers.

8258
03:28:57,191 --> 03:28:58,990
These are more on losers.

8259
03:28:59,020 --> 03:28:59,300
I was like,

8260
03:28:59,300 --> 03:29:00,133
well

8261
03:29:01,150 --> 03:29:03,910
I would like more eloquent
statement would you though?

8262
03:29:03,911 --> 03:29:05,860
Because like no one wants to talk about,

8263
03:29:05,920 --> 03:29:08,140
you know everyone the extremist
don't only give them a name,

8264
03:29:08,141 --> 03:29:08,860

8265
03:29:08,860 --> 03:29:13,210
They're losers fucking
losers because it like it is.

8266
03:29:13,240 --> 03:29:14,050
Cause if I see that,

8267
03:29:14,050 --> 03:29:15,580

8268
03:29:15,700 --> 03:29:16,141

8270
03:29:16,330 --> 03:29:16,481

8271
03:29:16,481 --> 03:29:17,780
Remember where the extremist now,

8272
03:29:17,781 --> 03:29:18,614

8273
03:29:18,620 --> 03:29:19,090
Hmm.

8274
03:29:19,090 --> 03:29:19,840
I like that.

8275
03:29:19,840 --> 03:29:20,470
Anyways,

8276
03:29:20,470 --> 03:29:22,150
I'm going to go get this
fucking grill started.

8277
03:29:23,290 --> 03:29:24,580
You focus on Shay would.

8278
03:29:25,730 --> 03:29:26,563
Okay.

8279
03:29:28,870 --> 03:29:30,470
This has been another fight.

8280
03:29:30,490 --> 03:29:32,800
This is so much fun and
we didn't do nothing.

8281
03:29:32,801 --> 03:29:33,520
Got Crazy.

8282
03:29:33,520 --> 03:29:34,500
We didn't go off the rails.

8283
03:29:34,501 --> 03:29:35,920
Sometimes it's just good time though.

8284
03:29:36,490 --> 03:29:37,121
Sometimes crazy.

8285
03:29:37,121 --> 03:29:37,720
It's fun.

8286
03:29:37,720 --> 03:29:38,331
Maybe Jude turn.

8287
03:29:38,331 --> 03:29:38,471
Boy,

8288
03:29:38,471 --> 03:29:41,350
you crazy down for 10 sorry.

8289
03:29:41,530 --> 03:29:43,300
Maybe we'll get crazy far.

8290
03:29:43,360 --> 03:29:45,000
All Ready?

8291
03:29:45,340 --> 03:29:45,910
Ready?

8292
03:29:45,910 --> 03:29:46,400
Ready?

8293
03:29:46,400 --> 03:29:48,310
Here's this Holloway.

8294
03:29:48,340 --> 03:29:48,790
All right,

8295
03:29:48,790 --> 03:29:49,271
everybody.

8296
03:29:49,271 --> 03:29:50,500
Thank you very much for tuning in.

8297
03:29:50,501 --> 03:29:52,270
We're sorry we didn't focus
too much on the fights,

8298
03:29:52,271 --> 03:29:52,870
but hey,

8299
03:29:52,870 --> 03:29:53,670
we talked some about,

8300
03:29:53,670 --> 03:29:53,891
you know,

8301
03:29:53,891 --> 03:29:56,590
what you're getting when you sign
up for the shale in New Zealand,

8302
03:29:58,220 --> 03:29:59,650
Hala [inaudible] k.

8303
03:29:59,651 --> 03:30:00,484
Dot com.

8304
03:30:10,210 --> 03:30:10,320
