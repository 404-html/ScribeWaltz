1
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:02,723
Okay.

2

one sex toy for a minute.

6
00:00:18,011 --> 00:00:22,750
Did I give you one last time? You
got my brother? Nice tight one.

7
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:25,450
All right. Buckle up bitches.
Michael Chavela was in the house.

8
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:30,520
This would be the spot where it played
the music, but I don't have any here.

9
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,470
My, my assistant is not here. So we're
going, we're going commando style.

10
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,080
It's good to be back here,
brother. Good to see you.

11
00:00:38,081 --> 00:00:42,010
My friend [inaudible] nationally known
and locally respected Michael Chavela,

12
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:47,170
my pal, my, my, my colleague.
Yeah, you're like, uh, we are,

13
00:00:47,171 --> 00:00:49,210
we have a, an interesting
friendship. You know,

14
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:52,890
where this is only like a few
of us that do a, this, uh,

15
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:58,000
martial arts commentary shit, you
know, professionally a small handful.

16
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:01,470
Yeah. You know, so it's, uh, it was
always, it was cool when I first met you.

17
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,440
You know, it was cool. It was cool. You're
a good dude. It was fun to hang with you,

18
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,900
man. You too. We first met
in Edmonton. Yeah. After your
show there. Yeah. Yeah. It's,

19
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,920
it's always nice when you know someone
else does what you do when you actually

20
00:01:11,921 --> 00:01:15,910
liked them, you know? Very true.
Very true. Thank you. Yeah, for sure.

21
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:19,190
No one's better at the k one shit
and there's no one better at,

22
00:01:19,191 --> 00:01:22,630
at Moitai commentary than you, man. You're
the greatest. I listen all the time.

23
00:01:22,631 --> 00:01:25,750
I watch that HC Nan, I told
you when you got here, when it,

24
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:28,930
Mike and his wife got here, uh,
I was, or his fiance rather.

25
00:01:28,931 --> 00:01:32,950
I was fucking working out in the
garage with his voice on the TV.

26
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:37,150
Yeah, I got it set up. So there's a TV
back there and that's all I ever watch.

27
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:41,710
You'll sit up out there is insane, man.
It's so nice to, it's crazy. I can never,

28
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:45,360
I have no excuse for not being in shape.
There's you as a gym right there. Yeah.

29
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:50,350
I can't, I don't have to go anywhere. I
step out of my house and water into it,

30
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,290
man. It's nice. Nice. That's good to
be here. This has been a long trip.

31
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:55,960
It's in the final stretch now.
Michael's thinking about moving here,

32
00:01:55,961 --> 00:01:59,290
ladies and gentlemen. Yeah. He might
move to United States of America,

33
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:03,220
so long way to travel brother.
Every two weeks from Melbourne to La.

34
00:02:03,221 --> 00:02:06,450
Then wherever we do the shows on
HD net and all the way back home.

35
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:08,980
Then when I have to go to Europe,
like before I came here,

36
00:02:08,981 --> 00:02:12,670
this trip I was in Europe in the last
month I was in Europe for Bama. It's just,

37
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,820
it's how far is it to Europe
from Australia to get to,

38
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,980
let's say Italy were just
ones before this trip,

39
00:02:17,981 --> 00:02:22,981
35 hours from the time I left my house
to the time I arrived in Rome was like 35

40
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:28,720
hours. Oh my God. Yeah. That
doesn't seem like it would be right.

41
00:02:28,721 --> 00:02:32,830
It seems like you're in the wrong way.
It seems like there must be a quicker way.

42
00:02:32,831 --> 00:02:34,940
Can we go the other way?
Can you go over the pole,

43
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:38,800
the wheel back around like superman?
Did you otherwise? I mean that's like,

44
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,190
that's like flying from Sydney to
Melbourne by going all the way around the

45
00:02:42,191 --> 00:02:45,670
planet. Yeah, but going the opposite
way. Really. Yeah. Well where is,

46
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:49,450
is there another way to go? No, there's
not like it would be a way to go.

47
00:02:49,451 --> 00:02:53,590
That's shorter. We have to go from
a, we got Melbourne up to Hong Kong,

48
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:58,510
then from Hong Kong we switched planes
and fly across China, Russia, Siberia.

49
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:01,630
I need a of the [inaudible] to
really wrap my head around this.

50
00:03:01,631 --> 00:03:04,600
I'm gonna need to look at a map of the
world. It's nuts, man. We very far away.

51
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,100
That's what I was used.
Travel so much.

52
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,950
You know you were just on a holiday
recently and you said you saw a lot of

53
00:03:08,951 --> 00:03:09,784
Aussies around.

54
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:13,060
You also use a traveling because Al
Della is good and you'll della sucks.

55
00:03:13,061 --> 00:03:14,800
So it's a good time for us to travel.
Yeah.

56
00:03:14,801 --> 00:03:17,620
Everything's cheaper than the moment
does at work, man. After all is killing.

57
00:03:17,621 --> 00:03:21,190
You'll della for the first time. I can
ever remember in mind in my life. Well,

58
00:03:21,191 --> 00:03:23,650
I never knew whether or not you guys
have a strong dollar or a weak dollar,

59
00:03:23,651 --> 00:03:26,650
but what I, I'll never understand
the dollar. I'll never understand.

60
00:03:26,651 --> 00:03:29,410
I don't understand how shifts and moves
and I didn't understand how it has is so

61
00:03:29,411 --> 00:03:31,450
strong.
It's such a small population as well.

62
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,270
How there's the same amount of people.
Okay.

63
00:03:34,271 --> 00:03:38,380
There's the same amount of stuff
and then somehow or another boom,

64
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:42,250
there's not as much money and
things are closing like it's, it's,

65
00:03:42,251 --> 00:03:43,440
it seems a logical,

66
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:47,770
it seems like if you look at it just from
a pure resource based standpoint, okay,

67
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:50,020
there's a certain amount of
oil is a certain amount of
wool and they're starting

68
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:50,721
to my plastic,

69
00:03:50,721 --> 00:03:54,250
certain amount of material to make things
certain amount of desire and need for

70
00:03:54,251 --> 00:03:58,610
these things. So once money gets moving,
it pretty much stays moving. What,

71
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:03,660
what is it that creates some giant hiccup
that fucks the whole system sideways?

72
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,600
I mean if you watch like inside
job or any of these movies on it,

73
00:04:07,601 --> 00:04:10,750
you get to find out what it really is
and see how deep the corruption is.

74
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,380
But to a lay person like myself who
knows very little about economics,

75
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,780
it almost seems like it can't happen,

76
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:19,420
but just even countries getting
into debt and I'm like, grace,

77
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:22,300
grace is almost bankrupt on what did
they do when they run out of money?

78
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:26,090
Now what does someone by grace,
we're right there too.

79
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:28,630
You know you guys were on the brink of
it as well and what happens when that

80
00:04:28,631 --> 00:04:33,360
happens? I mean they'll know.
It's like several trillion
dollars, trillion dollars.

81
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:37,240
Who Do we have the money to understand
who your barn is it other countries?

82
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,710
If every country in the world is in debt,
is that the game?

83
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:44,920
That would be the most ridiculous shit
ever. If that is the case, that would,

84
00:04:44,921 --> 00:04:47,290
it would really, it's someone
needs to write a book about that.

85
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:50,680
The world as bankruptcy
because if that is the case,

86
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:53,010
every country in the one that we have to
figure out who they might own the money

87
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,960
money too and once you find
out who they owe the money to,

88
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:58,450
then you find out the new world order.
Exactly.

89
00:04:58,451 --> 00:05:02,260
When you find out the real CFR and that
might be grace and now America is taking

90
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:03,230
me to listen from Taiwan,

91
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:06,880
how to spend too much money and
not be able to pay it all back.

92
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:08,770
We were talking about this before,

93
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:14,460
you know Michael's been doing the k one
commentary forever and all the great k

94
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:17,500
one events,
the grand prixs,

95
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:22,450
the k one max and the Max Grand Prixs
and the finals and fuck you call it some

96
00:05:22,451 --> 00:05:23,284
amazing fights,

97
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,280
but apparently it's just not as popular
as it used to be and now I'm there.

98
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:30,030
They're hurting financially unfortunately.
Wouldn't be Tom Financially,

99
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:33,270
most of their top fighters money that
a lot of this stuff, money as well.

100
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:34,600
It's just not coming,
coming through.

101
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:38,050
So without the money to be
able to pay for is how do you,

102
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,970
how are they even going to
stage a grand Prix this year?

103
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:43,090
How is the rain going to get to defend
the title if you can afford it? Yeah.

104
00:05:43,091 --> 00:05:44,430
Alistair's and your butter,
Harrison,

105
00:05:44,431 --> 00:05:46,480
he's sent me Schultes and
you're removing on jet skis.

106
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:51,580
I really don't see how
that isn't a home run.

107
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:53,600
If somebody wanted to pick
it up, you know, and I,

108
00:05:53,601 --> 00:05:55,630
I talked to Dana White
about this, I said, dude,

109
00:05:55,631 --> 00:05:58,030
if you ever thought about
buying the k one and it's like,

110
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:02,210
can people don't give a fuck about k one
and it's like, you know, people you know,

111
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:05,660
don't want to see kickboxing and sort of
like pka karate kind of like ruined it.

112
00:06:05,661 --> 00:06:08,270
Like there's some really good
fights but people, you know,

113
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:12,740
MMA is so huge and it's so popular that
it almost be like, and I saw his point,

114
00:06:12,741 --> 00:06:16,190
it's like almost like creating your own
competitor or something like that or

115
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,690
building up a business
that doesn't exist and but,

116
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,850
but that they product
though is pretty much one,

117
00:06:22,851 --> 00:06:26,840
somebody sees it then you're hooked on
it. Yeah, but that's what I'm saying.

118
00:06:26,841 --> 00:06:27,620
It's like, you know, you,

119
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:32,620
people might say that like some kickboxing
never took off or maybe maybe he's

120
00:06:33,201 --> 00:06:33,980
not.
As,

121
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:38,300
I know Dana doesn't spend nearly as much
time watching kickboxing as I do. I'm a,

122
00:06:38,301 --> 00:06:42,520
I'm a huge k one fan and I love
watching it. I watched it all the time.

123
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:45,530
There's guys who don't get into like Eddie
Bravo can't get into it, man. He goes,

124
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:48,200
I tried to watch, I can't watch
it. I mean maybe it's just,

125
00:06:48,201 --> 00:06:51,200
cause I started off in
striking base martial arts,

126
00:06:51,201 --> 00:06:55,010
so I can appreciate that Giorgio Petrosian
or the massage autos and those kinds

127
00:06:55,011 --> 00:06:56,510
of characters. But to me, man,

128
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:01,730
how the fuck do you not want the k
one heavyweight Grand Prix? I said,

129
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,670
ever been anything but fucking
crazy. Exactly. Every year.

130
00:07:04,671 --> 00:07:07,070
I don't think I can remember a
boring grumb pre might be like,

131
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:10,970
oh three Oh four when Remy want to both
times and both times you went like the

132
00:07:10,971 --> 00:07:15,370
distance in every fight,
every other Grand Prix has been amazing.

133
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,310
Really is an interesting case,
isn't he? He's so technical.

134
00:07:19,311 --> 00:07:22,280
He's an interesting guy and we're
a lot of fighters don't like him.

135
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:27,200
A lot of fighters don't like
his personality. They don't
like what he represents.

136
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:31,130
Remy, he's an interesting
guy. A gentlemen. Yeah,
like an absolute gentleman.

137
00:07:31,131 --> 00:07:36,080
So well mannered. But then you also have
to wonder if that is not just foreign.

138
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:39,440
It's in public. A lot of the fun is not
unlock remi. I personally liked the guy.

139
00:07:39,441 --> 00:07:42,710
He's a cool guy. I don't know if
he's a guy, could spend 24 hours.

140
00:07:42,711 --> 00:07:46,400
We thought hanging out at nightclubs
or parties with always a gentleman.

141
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,860
But you know,

142
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:51,030
I never see many of the other fighters
hanging out with remi for the people that

143
00:07:51,031 --> 00:07:53,990
don't know what we're talking about.
This is k one deep inside shit.

144
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:58,300
Remy is Remy [inaudible], who is
one of the greatest kickboxers, uh,

145
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,930
to ever come out of Holland,

146
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:05,110
which is one of the greatest kickboxing
centers in the world where America has

147
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:07,940
really kind of lost touch with kickboxing.

148
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:12,530
Holland has really embraced the
sport and it's gigantic over there.

149
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:17,660
Guys like Peter Hertz at guys like
our Nesto who Stan, you know, and,

150
00:08:17,661 --> 00:08:21,370
and hiring spoke enormously popular.
Rob came in,

151
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:25,430
there's a great friend of mine, Ramon
Dekkers. So there's so many great,

152
00:08:25,431 --> 00:08:28,340
great fighters that come out of there.
They're huge celebrities over there.

153
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:31,640
It's a different, it's a totally different
experience. Holland is a small country,

154
00:08:31,641 --> 00:08:36,641
but they're kickboxing is a legendary
for this one small part of the world.

155
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:40,700
They've produced some of the
greatest kickboxers of all times.

156
00:08:40,701 --> 00:08:43,700
And the respect over there for these
guys is very mainstream. I mean,

157
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,580
two years it might've been no,
2008 it was,

158
00:08:46,581 --> 00:08:49,430
and it's doe who Scott Knighted by.

159
00:08:49,431 --> 00:08:51,920
I don't know if a royal family or the
government must be the royal family of

160
00:08:51,921 --> 00:08:54,770
Holland obviously got knighted.
So we were joking Japan. I'm like,

161
00:08:54,771 --> 00:08:56,160
Ernesto tried to call you sir

162
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:01,040
enesto now, but how crazy is that to
think it kickboxer gets knighted made.

163
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:04,300
Could you imagine that happening
in America, in America,

164
00:09:04,301 --> 00:09:05,550
apart from happening in Britain,

165
00:09:05,551 --> 00:09:09,090
even no way Michael Bisping's can
become so Michael Bisping anytime soon.

166
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:14,220
In his own mind.
It is unusual.

167
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:17,820
And if fighters want to learn
kickboxing in this day and age,

168
00:09:17,821 --> 00:09:20,890
there's two places in the world
that they traveled to the,

169
00:09:20,891 --> 00:09:24,160
he will even travel to Thailand or
they'll travel to Holland. Yeah.

170
00:09:24,161 --> 00:09:27,880
It's that simple. If you want to learn
the genuine art of Muay Thai, you know,

171
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,860
which is Thailand's national martial art,

172
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:32,730
dating back thousands of years and as
long been their military martial arts

173
00:09:32,731 --> 00:09:35,730
still is there. The military martial
art, uh, you know, you've got to,

174
00:09:35,731 --> 00:09:38,460
you got to Thailand to learn it. Any of
the great camps over there from, you know,

175
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,910
fair tech, stick your
tongue, um, the WMC camping,

176
00:09:41,911 --> 00:09:45,590
Ko Samui and you learn the knees, the
elbows, the grappling and all that.

177
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:48,420
The Thai techniques.
If you go to Holland though,

178
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:52,380
what your primary learning is modified
tie. It's the, the, the punches,

179
00:09:52,381 --> 00:09:56,730
the kicks and the knees with limited
clenching and pretty much no elbows.

180
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,560
You know, they have elbow
fights over there obviously,

181
00:09:58,561 --> 00:10:02,130
but the main rules are modified tie,
which is knees and, and no elbows.

182
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,340
And why did they eliminate elbows?
Just something for the reason that, uh,

183
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:09,340
you know, the cuts, first of
all, stop a very good fight.

184
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:13,170
As much as I love seeing a good elbow.
There are a lot of times,

185
00:10:13,171 --> 00:10:17,050
especially commentating moy tai where I
rue having elbows in the sport because

186
00:10:17,051 --> 00:10:20,490
as I've seen some great battles with
two guys are going back and forth just

187
00:10:20,491 --> 00:10:24,000
pounding on each other for rounds. We
go into the fifth round, you think God,

188
00:10:24,001 --> 00:10:25,410
this is going to go down to the wire,

189
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,340
could be anyone's fight and then some
guy throws one elbow that cuts the other

190
00:10:29,341 --> 00:10:31,920
dude and the cut may not be that deep,

191
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:36,570
but most times they'll tend to stop a
fight now for cuts over the eyes and is

192
00:10:36,571 --> 00:10:41,040
going to running to the eyes and I've
seen perfectly good fights stopped from

193
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:43,950
cuts. I see it that way. But
I also see it the other way,

194
00:10:43,951 --> 00:10:47,130
like they're so effective.
You can't route if you take them out,

195
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,770
you're taking out a part of
what makes it a martial art.

196
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,440
If you're talking self defense,

197
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:54,240
like I believe more times one of the
best you can learn for self defense.

198
00:10:54,241 --> 00:10:57,900
It's so complete self defense reasons.
Yeah. For entertainment purposes though,

199
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:01,890
and especially for television purposes
and where you're trying to grow sports

200
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,870
like in Holland back in
the day and in Japan,

201
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:06,050
how they grew kickboxing
since you know mastery,

202
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:11,060
she invented k one 1993 and the theme
was all about television ratings in,

203
00:11:11,191 --> 00:11:14,920
okay one used to have a longtime clinching
rule where you couldn't put on a more

204
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,640
Thai clinch and grapple with the
guy like you doing Muay Thai.

205
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:22,060
But now it's like a roller until Alistair
came know Bob Sapp came along and guys,

206
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:27,360
good handle hang on to beetle and just
bludgeon them. So now it's like one hand,

207
00:11:27,361 --> 00:11:31,380
one clinch knee and release. But it's
all, it's all for television purposes.

208
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:34,410
You know, in in Thailand you have to
fight with elbows. You can't fight it.

209
00:11:34,411 --> 00:11:35,244
Modified tire,

210
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:39,120
I mean there's a lot of rules when you
find a proper sanctioned bout in in

211
00:11:39,121 --> 00:11:42,540
Thailand you've got to where the Hmong
coal and the flower shop around the neck

212
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:45,600
and a lot of guys were that the other
project of the arm bands and they do this,

213
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:49,350
the significance of all that stuff. It's
all superstitious. So the ties of very,

214
00:11:49,351 --> 00:11:51,780
very superstitious always have
been in usually the Hmong call,

215
00:11:51,781 --> 00:11:52,920
which is what they wear around their,

216
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:57,040
it looks like a like a like a a tennis
racket. Yeah, that's compulsory.

217
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:59,200
If you fight for the WMC in particular,

218
00:11:59,201 --> 00:12:03,340
which is the will sanction body to where
among call on your way to the ring,

219
00:12:03,341 --> 00:12:04,150
you have to do it.

220
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:08,430
You also have to do the when the
why crew [inaudible] which is a,

221
00:12:08,431 --> 00:12:11,560
a preflight ritual of a tie
fighter that looks like a dance.

222
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:15,640
I suppose a mix between a dance in a,
a yoga routine almost.

223
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,810
And what they are doing there
is, it's, it's very deep,

224
00:12:19,811 --> 00:12:23,770
meaning their blessing their corner and
asking the gods to bless their corner.

225
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:27,820
I they trainer and also bless the opposite
corner and hope that your opponent

226
00:12:27,821 --> 00:12:31,360
doesn't get hurt too much and you have to
perform this before every single fight.

227
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:35,280
Uh, you know, WMC in Thailand
in particular and it got these,

228
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,310
I can go for a long time.

229
00:12:36,311 --> 00:12:40,020
Some of them I've seen had been up to
five minutes long. You know, it's, it's,

230
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:44,370
it's crazy, but it's all part of
the, the beautiful formal history of,

231
00:12:44,371 --> 00:12:47,880
of the sport that they're maintaining.
Do you know Sam Sheridan? You know, EMS?

232
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:51,430
I was the writer of a fighter's
heart and a fighter's mind.

233
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,580
He's actually married to
my friend Patty. And, uh,

234
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:57,700
I got a chance to hang out with that
dude and talk to him. He's a really,

235
00:12:57,701 --> 00:13:00,550
really cool guy. And he, um,

236
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:03,800
he went over there and lived
in Thailand and you know,

237
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:07,870
stayed over there for months and had a
Moitai fight and they documented it for a

238
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:11,410
TV show. It was a really fascinating
experience, man. It's really,

239
00:13:11,411 --> 00:13:16,160
really cool to watch. He did the full,
the dance, the white crew and the red boy.

240
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:20,370
Yeah. He did all that before, you know,
all traditional. Yup. You know, and uh,

241
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:22,600
it was fascinating.
He got really set up.

242
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:27,580
They set them up with some Yakuza type
dude covered in tattoos who was a bad ass

243
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,010
kickboxer and they tried to say
that this guy was like an amateur,

244
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,080
but the guy wasn't in that good
a shape and he tired out and,

245
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:35,810
and Sam got him changed.
He got hurt before that.

246
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:39,220
He got cracked by this guy and he's,
you know, relative, relatively amateur.

247
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,010
It's crazy. Everything. It's just
so popular. You know, it's on TV.

248
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,170
Every night is on channel
seven show it show a little.

249
00:13:44,171 --> 00:13:47,320
The fight to channel seven has their own
stadium. And as you know, in Thailand,

250
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:49,780
it's not so much about
being a world champion,

251
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:53,770
it's about being a stadium champion. And
the two main stadiums are lung, Piney,

252
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:56,620
and registered moon stadium.
And if you're a champion of evil,

253
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,800
either one of those stadiums,
you're like the man, you know,

254
00:13:59,801 --> 00:14:04,650
you're like top of the
sport. WMC champions. It's
WBC champions. It's like Eh.

255
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:07,660
Then I consider them that highly. And
Thailand, if you're a stadium champion,

256
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,070
you're the man.
Wow.

257
00:14:09,071 --> 00:14:12,880
So is it like this is my house and
then everybody has to come to fight.

258
00:14:12,881 --> 00:14:16,980
You and your house pretty much offend
that title. So a stadium champion,

259
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:20,920
it's the stadiums are so popular that a
fighter like say dodger stadium and the

260
00:14:20,921 --> 00:14:23,650
guy would be the Dodgers stadium
champion, don't just study them, champion.

261
00:14:23,651 --> 00:14:26,170
And then people would all come
and have a ranking system. Wow.

262
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:29,380
And then you get to be number one
contender and so and so for the, you know,

263
00:14:29,381 --> 00:14:32,440
the dodger stadium title. And that's
the thing. It's, it's, it's huge.

264
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:36,770
And they start really young,
right? They stuck alone.
Five, six years old, you know,

265
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:41,170
got, you know, kids are fighting already
by the time that they reach a, you know,

266
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:44,870
18, 1920 years old. They've
already had 150 fights, you know,

267
00:14:44,871 --> 00:14:49,330
we'd come and setting Thai guys, send shy
central. I saw king start youtube him.

268
00:14:49,331 --> 00:14:52,880
He's amazing. Does these acrobatic
cartwheel kicks, you know,

269
00:14:52,881 --> 00:14:57,120
form of leukemia and regimen champion,
multiple champion and,

270
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:01,100
and you know, commentating him just
to fight that he had in Queensland,

271
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:04,010
Australia a few weeks ago
against Cook Fin. Liason Yeah.

272
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:06,140
Dude's got like 230 fights,

273
00:15:06,141 --> 00:15:11,141
240 fights of common sighted guides
with over 300 fights and it's full tie

274
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:13,970
rules.
That's knees and elbow.

275
00:15:13,971 --> 00:15:18,330
And in my opinion that style is the
most effective style for standup. Yeah,

276
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,030
there's a lot of techniques that don't,

277
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:24,010
that you can you find in other martial
arts like wheel kicks and turning side

278
00:15:24,011 --> 00:15:25,640
kicks that are real knockout techniques.

279
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:30,050
But if you want to look at
one comprehensive package
for striking it's soul,

280
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:34,730
it's so economical with the leg kicks
that this short movements to create big

281
00:15:34,731 --> 00:15:36,950
power,
the emphasis on power,

282
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,100
especially the emphasis on power leg
kicks where they know there's only a

283
00:15:40,101 --> 00:15:41,400
certain amount of these you can take.
You know,

284
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:44,210
there's a lot of fleshy techniques,
as you said before in other martial arts.

285
00:15:44,211 --> 00:15:46,100
But think about it for
self defense purpose.

286
00:15:46,101 --> 00:15:49,760
If you're in a nightclub and some drunk
guys belled you up against a wall,

287
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,160
you're not gonna be able to pull
off a spinning hook kick, right?

288
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:55,730
Grab his fucking head.
You're grabbing me the fuck out of him,

289
00:15:55,731 --> 00:15:58,730
an elbow him and go to
work on him on the inside,

290
00:15:58,731 --> 00:16:01,940
which about Moitai does perfectly and
you know Moitai is one of the most

291
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:07,010
brilliant at that. That ability to
control the neck and throw guys around.

292
00:16:07,011 --> 00:16:11,720
Like until you've had a guy like Cayman
or someone you know who's like a a world

293
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:14,630
champion and grab a hold your neck and
throw you around from that position,

294
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:18,770
it's amazing how much control they have
over you control your neck like a handle.

295
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,290
You control the body weight, you
control the opponent's motion, which is,

296
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:26,030
I'm surprised that actually we don't see
in mixed martial arts people utilizing

297
00:16:26,031 --> 00:16:30,020
the Thai clinch the way the Thais do.
You get per takedowns yet again,

298
00:16:30,021 --> 00:16:34,310
you watch someone like you know WMC
champion tongue Matsui or sand shy and you

299
00:16:34,311 --> 00:16:35,900
see him look up with the
guy and when he fought,

300
00:16:35,901 --> 00:16:39,600
like Kurt fiend license in Australia would
look up with curt and just punch into

301
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,453
the canvas.

302
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:44,270
And the Thais also follow you down onto
the canvas because what they'd like to

303
00:16:44,271 --> 00:16:47,330
do is lead the way. Drop a neon.
You, you know, near your head.

304
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:50,120
Now you're on the rib
cage on underway down.

305
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,610
So if you look at that from a
mixed martial arts position,

306
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:57,080
these guys are often ending up in a mentor
most if not inside control from this

307
00:16:57,081 --> 00:17:01,460
beautiful ranching takedown and they
can throw even grapplers around with it.

308
00:17:01,461 --> 00:17:04,400
Man, it's like a marijuana Anderson
got ahold of rich Franklin.

309
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,130
Rich Franklin had no idea that
Anderson would ever do that to him.

310
00:17:07,131 --> 00:17:09,590
His thought was at Anderson is
going to want to strike with him,

311
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,120
so he's going to want
to keep his distance.

312
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:14,480
When Anderson just grabbed a hold of
him and the walk those two forearms

313
00:17:14,481 --> 00:17:16,690
together, it's like you're
caught in a vice grip man.

314
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:18,920
If you're finding a good Moy Thai fighter,
you're not getting out.

315
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:21,290
I've seen small ties to,
you know,

316
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:25,100
small tires doing seminars in Australia
and and watching them try and throw

317
00:17:25,101 --> 00:17:29,420
around big guys. Now you see like
a 55 kilogram tie throwing up,

318
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:33,740
throwing around a guy that weighs 85 90
kilos, just rag dolling it. It's easy.

319
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:37,310
It's an amazing position and
people don't utilize it enough,

320
00:17:37,311 --> 00:17:40,340
but it's one of those things
that's going to slowly come over.

321
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:44,240
You know the the real high level versions
of we're going to come over into MMA

322
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:47,360
and then we're going to really see
people appreciating it. I see. You know,

323
00:17:47,361 --> 00:17:50,100
you see the Anderson Silva version of it,
but there's some

324
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,840
guys out there like bull cow,
just grab that motherfucker,

325
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:57,430
grabs a hold of your neck. He gets those
elbows planted and clips that hand.

326
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:02,250
Man, you're locked. It's like
anything else. There's levels of it.

327
00:18:02,251 --> 00:18:06,690
There's the Marcello Garcia rear
naked choke, which isn't, you know,

328
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,810
and all due respect is not like
a Mark Coleman rear naked choke.

329
00:18:09,811 --> 00:18:12,060
You know what I mean?
There's levels of the technique.

330
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,740
Mark Coleman gets your back.

331
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:15,910
He's got to squeeze the fucking shit
out of you and put you on conscious.

332
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,580
But he's a gorilla brute force power
Ressa even though he knows the technique,

333
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:21,810
he doesn't have it.

334
00:18:21,811 --> 00:18:26,100
That laser sharp effective
technique like a Marcella Garcia,

335
00:18:26,101 --> 00:18:29,500
like the highest end Brazilian Jiu Jitsu
and that's no disrespect to call it.

336
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:33,990
It's just like these really super, super
technical guys. You get a guy who super,

337
00:18:33,991 --> 00:18:37,500
super technical back clinch and really
understands it and the thing is that the

338
00:18:37,501 --> 00:18:41,280
tie fighters, you know these
guys are doing it with 12
ounce, 10 ounce gloves on,

339
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:44,670
just so hard, you know, to look
in a clinch like that's so tight.

340
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:47,610
The way they do it. These, these large
gloves, these aren't mixed martial arts,

341
00:18:47,611 --> 00:18:48,211
four ounces,

342
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:50,970
you know there's a button they have the
benefit of not worrying about someone

343
00:18:50,971 --> 00:18:54,360
taking them down. Very true. That's
really what a big, big part of it is.

344
00:18:54,361 --> 00:18:56,850
And it's like one of the things that
I would tell people about taekwondo.

345
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,670
Taekwondo is not the most
effective martial art,

346
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:02,550
but there's a few things in it
that if you get really good at it,

347
00:19:02,551 --> 00:19:05,970
you can fuck people up with it and they
won't know that you know how to do it.

348
00:19:05,971 --> 00:19:09,240
Because for most people it's a, it's
a very, very difficult thing to learn.

349
00:19:09,241 --> 00:19:11,640
Like spinning hook kicks,
head kicks on those techniques.

350
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:15,420
And the reason why people get so good
at it in taekwondo is because in Tiguan

351
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:18,690
don't tournaments you can't punch to the
face and you tank can take a guy down.

352
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:21,900
So you only concentrate on all
these crazy leg techniques.

353
00:19:21,901 --> 00:19:26,901
And in doing so you get an a level of
dexterity that you would never get if you

354
00:19:27,001 --> 00:19:30,330
look at the whole thing. Yeah. So that's
like the argument in martial arts,

355
00:19:30,331 --> 00:19:35,331
in mixed martial arts of
being the specialist instead
of being someone who's a

356
00:19:35,911 --> 00:19:37,980
jack of all trades, you know, someone who,

357
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:43,040
being someone who's a killer at Moitai
or being someone who's a killer at at one

358
00:19:43,351 --> 00:19:48,351
particular aspect of mixed martial arts
is way better than being pretty good at

359
00:19:48,451 --> 00:19:50,370
all of them. The other thing
gets me about, you know,

360
00:19:50,371 --> 00:19:52,170
you're talking that kicking
in the various martial arts,

361
00:19:52,171 --> 00:19:54,450
it's just how you think to yourself.

362
00:19:54,451 --> 00:19:55,800
If you don't know anything
about martial arts,

363
00:19:55,801 --> 00:19:59,160
you think how many possible ways are
there to throw around kicking somebody.

364
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:03,510
But the fact is there are so many
different ways. Shushing karate throws a,

365
00:20:03,511 --> 00:20:04,050
I'm a Washer,

366
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:06,810
Getty different than around kick from
taekwondo and different from around keep

367
00:20:06,811 --> 00:20:07,644
from Chicago,

368
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,890
different from around keep by Sabat
fodder different from a ground keep from a

369
00:20:10,891 --> 00:20:13,030
moist tie fighter.
So many different ways to,

370
00:20:13,031 --> 00:20:16,820
they throw them between the art and it's
amazing how you know these are adaptive

371
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,030
of hundreds of years.

372
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:21,120
Well the question Mark Craig is really
just starting to make its way into MMA.

373
00:20:21,121 --> 00:20:23,840
I mean really starting to be more
effective and that meant something to calc

374
00:20:23,841 --> 00:20:26,340
hushing guys have been throwing
for taekwondo guys forever.

375
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:29,870
It's the wheat and taekwondo. He would
call it the fake front round kick. So you,

376
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:34,470
and basically the idea is that it comes
like a front kick and then turns over

377
00:20:34,471 --> 00:20:38,370
and nowhere and, and the, the opponent
has no idea it's going to hit his face.

378
00:20:38,371 --> 00:20:41,660
And those are the ones that really fuck
you up if you want to say them like you

379
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:45,810
glare by fight Tosa or Francesco Puleo
and that's why they called it the

380
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:49,000
Brazilian won't get the Brazilian
Cape because of those two gentlemen.

381
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,610
Exactly why these guys were bad
ass killed Christian fighters.

382
00:20:51,611 --> 00:20:54,780
It made their way to k one. Yep. They
both had that technique down, you know,

383
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:58,330
otherwise known as the upside down kick
or question mark. Kick. Nice. I love it.

384
00:20:58,450 --> 00:20:59,590
Brilliant kick.
And you know,

385
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:02,860
we still don't see the front leg
roundhouse kick from taekwondo style.

386
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:05,470
There's a fast taekwondo
front leg roundhouse kick.

387
00:21:05,471 --> 00:21:10,471
But the thing about a taekwondo guy is
that if you get really good at taekwondo,

388
00:21:10,751 --> 00:21:13,870
you were going to have to be the kind of
guy that can stop and look at it and go,

389
00:21:13,871 --> 00:21:17,890
okay, but I suck it all these
other things. Now I've got
to go get my ass kicked,

390
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:22,120
uh, at at something that I suck at
instead of go to the gym and be a hero.

391
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:24,640
Now you're going to the gym and
getting capped out all the time.

392
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:27,310
When you do that lead leg Gramke
can talk window. You switching up,

393
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:29,190
will you throw it off the
lead right off to read leg.

394
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,690
Really slide in your slide and it's
going to amazing amount of power. Yeah.

395
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:34,080
And it's very fast.
Yeah.

396
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:37,960
It's almost like a fence or coming
forward to trusting the Saudia Iraq on the

397
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:41,530
leaf. You know, he used to do it,
but he did it. Thai style was Paleo.

398
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:46,090
Paleo had a very good front leg roundhouse
kick. Yeah, he was was more Thai style.

399
00:21:46,091 --> 00:21:49,570
He put a little more hip to it and
more power, I'm sure if his landed.

400
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:54,070
But the thing about the taekwondo one was
you slide in on it and you slide it on.

401
00:21:54,071 --> 00:21:57,070
It's very effective. Yeah. Very
quick technique. Yeah. There's just,

402
00:21:57,071 --> 00:22:01,330
and like the spinning back kick. I mean,
it'd be because of a few guys, you know,

403
00:22:01,331 --> 00:22:04,960
because of, um, uh, Dennis Seaver,
he's got a wicked one. Yeah. You know,

404
00:22:04,961 --> 00:22:09,520
a few guys throw it in a really good at
the Charles McCarthy, a knockout of that,

405
00:22:09,521 --> 00:22:12,400
um, uh, shit, I'm blanking on his name.

406
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:13,643
Who?

407
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:17,840
Oh, I can't believe I can't remember
his name. No, I'm just stuck to,

408
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:19,630
okay.

409
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:23,860
You want to see the best
turning Becky, Mike Bernardo,
Mike Bruno, sorry. Andy Hug.

410
00:22:23,861 --> 00:22:26,860
When he knocked out Mike Bernard and
the Grand Prix final or Andy Hug have a

411
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,371
motto,

412
00:22:27,371 --> 00:22:31,330
crazy texted talks to the thigh and
nobody had ever seen a turn Becky to the

413
00:22:31,331 --> 00:22:35,140
fight before and it was brilliant. So
Youtube, Andy Hug versus Mike Bernarda,

414
00:22:35,141 --> 00:22:37,180
you'll find it there. K
One Grand Prix, you know,

415
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:40,330
final and a flight that nobody,

416
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:42,760
man that nobody fought could
get to the top of the sport.

417
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:47,761
Cause Andy Hug was a big time Hakushin
legend [inaudible] world champion and you

418
00:22:48,141 --> 00:22:51,130
know, entered k one is as
the smallest fighter ever.

419
00:22:51,131 --> 00:22:54,550
Pretty much in one of the
launches fighters ever
couldn't box to save his life

420
00:22:54,551 --> 00:22:59,100
at the start because like
taekwondo caucus, she never
allows face punches. Yeah.

421
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:04,190
In any of their competitions and taught
himself how to box and persistence and,

422
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:07,290
and became the biggest superstar
in, in k one history. And there's a,

423
00:23:07,291 --> 00:23:11,440
there's a bit of controversy behind
him because he got really big.

424
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:15,760
He got really physically big and a
lot of people going, okay, like what?

425
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:18,980
What's that guy doing? Like that guy
just gained a fuck load of weight.

426
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:21,210
[inaudible] this was a little controversy
loss. Actually we had a heavy,

427
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:25,270
it's surrounded Andy's death as well that
the leukemia came on so quickly and so

428
00:23:25,271 --> 00:23:27,780
suddenly there's always that
sort of little background rumor.

429
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,440
Well was it cause he was on something,

430
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:33,130
you know that therefore speed up this
process and you got to wonder man.

431
00:23:33,131 --> 00:23:37,030
You know when you're in such a dangerous
environment like k one k one is,

432
00:23:37,031 --> 00:23:40,480
if you've never seen it, it's, I'm
a fucking huge fan of it. I mean it,

433
00:23:40,481 --> 00:23:45,481
it really is almost more gladiatorial
den MMA in a way because guys have to

434
00:23:45,741 --> 00:23:46,040
fight

435
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,130
multiple times a night. That's one of
the few places where they still do it.

436
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:52,530
Three fights in one night to win the
Grand Prix, you have to fight and you,

437
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:57,540
you got to fight three semi Schiltz three
Badr Hari three Ma Remy bombed jazz.

438
00:23:57,951 --> 00:24:02,680
Three good counsel. And it's
crazy. That guy's on the up,

439
00:24:02,681 --> 00:24:05,390
man. Go Con Saki is on the up. He's crazy.

440
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:10,940
If you go look, go con Saki, look
and Daniel Geeta, he's another one,

441
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:14,080
Daniel Geeta with those leg kicks man,

442
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:17,210
this little video clip with him in Japan
a couple of years ago and I said to him

443
00:24:17,211 --> 00:24:19,400
at the end of the cleaning, you
know, throw Lakey to my leg.

444
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,400
I got Daniel just like really, really
light. And Dan, he's a great guy.

445
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:25,730
One of the nicest guys just threw this
tip, tap leg kick on me, but I'm like,

446
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:28,070
shit for the next three days,
man.

447
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:30,980
You know the reason I do want to take
that butter hurry, one over in Holland,

448
00:24:30,981 --> 00:24:32,980
what are the, the voicemail
says about a hiring, you know,

449
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:34,430
a lot of people ask me about that.
I'm like,

450
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:38,810
well I was going to take a leg
kickoff Barda and dude, he's eyes Joe,

451
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:43,290
he's eyes when he lines up to kick this,
they'd change.

452
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:47,150
Like he becomes possessed.
He's turned shark like black.

453
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:52,040
And I genuinely shit myself cause I'm
standing there standing in front of butter

454
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:55,640
and butter goes to me, Mikey, if you've
got insurance, I'm my here, whatever, man.

455
00:24:55,641 --> 00:24:58,410
He goes, no, no, no. If you've got
insurance and then, but as coach man,

456
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:01,220
Mike from Mike's team's like,
yeah, do you have insurance?

457
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:05,360
And Alastar start talking Dutch to each
other with these like concerned looks

458
00:25:05,361 --> 00:25:08,510
for me. I'm saying to my producer,
Daryl, what the fuck's going on?

459
00:25:08,511 --> 00:25:10,970
What are these guys talking about?
And the,

460
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:14,450
and the Melvins sort of just gives me
this look as if to say, don't do it.

461
00:25:14,451 --> 00:25:17,660
Don't take the lickey Melvin
Manhoef men off yet. Listen man,

462
00:25:17,661 --> 00:25:21,680
when Melvin Manhoef is
telling you is dangerous, uh,

463
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:26,700
due to go to the page with a dog collar
on a guy who looks like a god Damn

464
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:28,520
Superhero comic book.

465
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:31,700
And I put the pad there and I was
ready and then I just shoot myself,

466
00:25:31,701 --> 00:25:34,220
gave it to my passenger and I
said, hell, you take the kick.

467
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:37,940
I needed to hear the thud. You know, when
you watch the show and, but do that man,

468
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:41,630
but is intense. I love the
guy. He's my favorite fighter.

469
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:45,770
Motherfucker is scary man.
He's eyes just go black.

470
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:49,010
Just no emotion in there. Yeah.
By her higher, he's no joke.

471
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:53,810
He's a terrifying one of the all time,
high,

472
00:25:53,811 --> 00:25:57,950
highest level guys to ever come out
of Holland as well. Scary, scary,

473
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,300
scary skillset.

474
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:02,840
Now the power that he throws to knock
people out and you see his knockout of

475
00:26:02,841 --> 00:26:07,820
like Roselawn cutter ev, we puts the
nose in slow motion through the head.

476
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:11,330
Crazy. While we were talking about this
before that he does a lot of stuff.

477
00:26:11,331 --> 00:26:13,010
Did they tell you not
to do like these swings?

478
00:26:13,011 --> 00:26:16,940
Full power with every shot sometimes and
he leaves himself open because of that,

479
00:26:16,941 --> 00:26:21,050
but it's like, it's not Mike's
gym do or die style too. I mean,

480
00:26:21,051 --> 00:26:22,190
Mike hypes these guys up.

481
00:26:22,191 --> 00:26:24,770
I'm still not sure exactly
what Mike says to those guys,

482
00:26:24,771 --> 00:26:28,100
but if you ever watch a Melvin entrance
robota hurry entrance, you know,

483
00:26:28,101 --> 00:26:31,730
you see my just absolutely Skitch out
of the guide when they're at the top of

484
00:26:31,731 --> 00:26:34,310
the catwalk and for some reason he is,
owns them.

485
00:26:34,311 --> 00:26:38,390
Get them in the zone and fuck your
works, man. It's nuts. Nuts. It's a,

486
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,320
it's one of the,

487
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:42,620
he's one of the best at doing that about
hyping guys up before and when you can

488
00:26:42,621 --> 00:26:46,170
tell those guys, believe in him,
man, that guy's a badass coach.

489
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,780
Are you still going to get a whole? And
by the way, I do have to go to Holland.

490
00:26:48,781 --> 00:26:49,820
I'm going to get a hold on it.
Go.

491
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:53,790
Come with me one day with all the travel
and I do with the UFC and with comedy

492
00:26:53,791 --> 00:26:57,630
and you know, and it's, it's hard man.
It's hard to schedule some other time.

493
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:01,260
I'm just hoping that eventually
there'll be a UFC in Holland. I mean,

494
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,600
I think there's some laws
against it right now,

495
00:27:03,601 --> 00:27:07,650
which is outrageous when you consider
their great history and kickboxing that we

496
00:27:07,651 --> 00:27:10,940
talked about Holland called
politicians don't be stupid.

497
00:27:10,941 --> 00:27:13,860
You can make a lot of money and
the world needs to see it there.

498
00:27:13,861 --> 00:27:18,750
You guys are the birth of the greatest
form of kickboxing the world has ever

499
00:27:18,751 --> 00:27:20,260
known. In my opinion. I think the,

500
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:23,670
I mean I love the ties and
the ties created more time,

501
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:25,860
but I believe that the Dutch
took it to the next level.

502
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,910
They took it to another level.
You know, guys like rob came in,

503
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,300
he took it to another level. I've been
able on Coupa, Ballantine, the pioneers,

504
00:27:33,301 --> 00:27:34,860
they went to Thailand and fought,

505
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:38,100
then brought this stuff back over to
Holland and then took it from there.

506
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:41,760
And when you watch Ramon fight, Ramon
Dekkers fight and we fought in Thailand.

507
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:45,300
He was doing some shit that
they were his hands, you know,

508
00:27:45,301 --> 00:27:49,320
that's what the Dutch did.
They added much superior hand tech.

509
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:52,380
But this thing of the times its size
always and still to this day start very

510
00:27:52,381 --> 00:27:55,890
slowly. The reason being that in
Thailand they bet on the fights.

511
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:58,500
So even while the flat starts
they still taking bets.

512
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:02,580
So traditionally what the ties would do
would be to start very slowly and let

513
00:28:02,581 --> 00:28:06,330
the bits come in and not turn on the pace
until the third round as to what they

514
00:28:06,331 --> 00:28:10,080
do to this day. Still when you find
most Westerners fighting a tie,

515
00:28:10,081 --> 00:28:11,250
particularly in Thailand,

516
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:14,070
I always think the best thing to do is
just go for their jaw lines straight away.

517
00:28:14,071 --> 00:28:18,140
Bulrush them go hell for leather on the
ties jaw because usually he's going to

518
00:28:18,141 --> 00:28:20,850
start very slow.
He's going to sit back with that style.

519
00:28:20,851 --> 00:28:25,710
Cities Paste to the music and you know
that music picks up in intensity as every

520
00:28:25,711 --> 00:28:27,320
round goes on.
For those that don't know Moy,

521
00:28:27,321 --> 00:28:30,540
Thai traditional Mai Tai is
always accompanied by music.

522
00:28:30,541 --> 00:28:35,160
And usually in Thailand it's a live
band. Ringside, they have an oboe. Uh,

523
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:38,100
they have the little symbols,
they have like a fucking thing.

524
00:28:38,101 --> 00:28:42,330
It looks like a guitar and they
play the music to set there.

525
00:28:42,331 --> 00:28:44,790
It's like a metronome.
So they sit their time to it.

526
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:48,750
And as the rounds go on in music
gets quicker and quicker and quicker.

527
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:51,210
If you've watched kickboxer, you know
the movie, you'll see it on there.

528
00:28:51,211 --> 00:28:53,640
The music in the background and you know,

529
00:28:53,641 --> 00:28:55,920
the ties always traditionally start very,
very slowly.

530
00:28:55,921 --> 00:29:00,090
First two rounds can be an absolute
fucking cure for insomnia when you're

531
00:29:00,091 --> 00:29:00,841
watching my tie,

532
00:29:00,841 --> 00:29:03,150
if you don't know what you're
watching in the third round though,

533
00:29:03,151 --> 00:29:06,660
this fucker's just turning up and then
it starts slamming those leg kicks and

534
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:08,160
they're not big combination fighters,

535
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:12,950
you know that it's measured with his leg
kicks and just chop down with, you know,

536
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:14,580
disarm goes back,

537
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:17,190
which was also one of the big and
doings of the ties to cause the ties.

538
00:29:17,191 --> 00:29:21,150
All I did that the chop kicks but they'll
throw the kicks so hard instead of

539
00:29:21,151 --> 00:29:24,540
leaving their hand up here they chopped
down because I knew that there was not a

540
00:29:24,541 --> 00:29:26,530
chance that an opponent,
because boxing is like the,

541
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:31,710
the lowest scored technique in my tie
that it's don't consider boxing very high

542
00:29:31,711 --> 00:29:34,590
at all. So then I worked on it as much as
I do their kicks in the knees and their

543
00:29:34,591 --> 00:29:38,050
elbows. So the ties were
traditionally chopped their hand down,

544
00:29:38,051 --> 00:29:41,770
tick kick with more power and a lot of
westerns that used to be able to hook

545
00:29:41,771 --> 00:29:43,960
them and be able to pick them off.
Cause this hand to come down.

546
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,850
Nothing to cover the side of the face.

547
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,880
Whereas now a lot of western kickbox
ECC in particularly a lot of the Dutch,

548
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:52,570
they'll throw their keep but still
managed to keep the forearm up to predict.

549
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:56,520
They go with less power and they go with
something that they could land. Exactly,

550
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:57,641
exactly.

551
00:29:57,641 --> 00:30:00,790
And you've seen someone like about a
hurry that when an opponent throws a

552
00:30:00,791 --> 00:30:02,230
chopping,
he can shop with their hands,

553
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:06,400
but has got that reach to be able to
scale up the Santo Straight Rock Cross and

554
00:30:06,401 --> 00:30:09,180
just knock guys out reaches
a huge advantage. Man.

555
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:12,070
People don't realize when you see
a guy like Jon Jones fighting,

556
00:30:12,071 --> 00:30:14,320
Jon Jones has got like,
man,

557
00:30:14,321 --> 00:30:19,321
what a monster advantage that is getting
inside that Vitali Klitschko box that

558
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,610
you get inside that Chad.

559
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:24,760
This is why when he fought David Haney
and I was watching it with a mic back

560
00:30:24,761 --> 00:30:27,610
home, who's British, you know, and he'd
been on debit high and he's like, Nah,

561
00:30:27,611 --> 00:30:31,240
he's going to be too fast and too slick.
And I said to him, Bro, there's no way.

562
00:30:31,241 --> 00:30:33,430
Hey fucking gets inside that jab to land.

563
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:38,110
Anything of consequence on Klitschko as
long as Klitschkos in shape and as long

564
00:30:38,111 --> 00:30:41,440
as he is in good condition and motivated
and as no knee problems so he can move

565
00:30:41,441 --> 00:30:43,630
well,
your odds are very slim.

566
00:30:43,631 --> 00:30:46,970
You got to run in and get that Chin
really quick to the block. You know,

567
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:50,410
Alistair Overeem recently saying he'd,
he'd want a box. The Klitschko brothers.

568
00:30:50,411 --> 00:30:54,160
I'm like, are you fucking serious? I love
LSD, man. One of my favorite fighters.

569
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:57,220
But he is getting owned in a
boxing fight against fatality.

570
00:30:57,221 --> 00:31:01,340
Klitschko well both of them. A lot
of mirrors. Well Vladimir is a,

571
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:05,320
the more technical boxer just Vitaly is
thought to be the tougher guy. Right?

572
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:07,820
He's like, it used to be a decent
kickboxer back in the day. Yeah.

573
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:12,890
They're both assassins and they're
both fucking like doctors, right?

574
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:15,100
They're both brilliant man,
highly educated.

575
00:31:15,101 --> 00:31:18,680
They speak like five different
languages. They live in Germany. They're,

576
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:21,910
they're fucking their scores for
like their, their, their, uh,

577
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:26,100
how many people watch their shows just
for getting the ratings for their fights

578
00:31:26,101 --> 00:31:28,300
in Germany can't be believed.

579
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:31,710
Like there's no reason for them to
ever even consider fighting in America.

580
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:35,860
They get seen by like 19 million fucking
people and that's who the Europeans

581
00:31:35,861 --> 00:31:38,980
like an eloquent technical fighter
like that pulls in the audiences.

582
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,120
Going back to Andy Hug,

583
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:43,600
you're talking about before when Andy
used to find in these broadcasts, he's,

584
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:46,270
he's, he's fights were
broadcast on switch to TV alive.

585
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,620
It would outright the tennis matches and
Martina Hingis and outright the switch

586
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,390
national soccer team.
I mean,

587
00:31:52,391 --> 00:31:55,450
just fucking extraordinary
figures that they used to do.

588
00:31:55,451 --> 00:31:58,950
And Andy liked the Klitschkos
was well spoken, clean cut call.

589
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:03,040
The educated could speak three or four
languages and there was nothing to

590
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:05,320
dislike about the guy.
I never got to meet him,

591
00:32:05,321 --> 00:32:07,660
but I did get to interview
him over the phone, uh,

592
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:11,620
probably about two years before he died.
And just talking to him, he was just,

593
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:16,060
it just eloquent. Just could just tell
a story without, without a flinch,

594
00:32:16,061 --> 00:32:19,960
without an, I'm on her nerves.
Just tremendous. How old
was Andy Hug when he died?

595
00:32:19,961 --> 00:32:22,540
He was pretty young, right? He was
young, was maybe, I can't remember.

596
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:26,030
Maybe mid thirties when he died. It
wasn't a very big guy. There wasn't nine.

597
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:30,280
It just barely six foot barely is bill
foot couldn't book when he was fighting

598
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:33,010
in k one he had to fight
it. Heavyweight. Right.

599
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,540
There was only one weight
class I might close, open wide.

600
00:32:35,541 --> 00:32:37,060
So heels fighting guys
that were bigger than him,

601
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:40,250
you know Bernardo weighed a lot more
than him. And when he first started

602
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:43,450
kickboxing, what was his weight before
he went into k one now heels, heels,

603
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:43,971
very lane.

604
00:32:43,971 --> 00:32:47,510
When he started he was like one 67 I've
seen some old photos of Andy if he's

605
00:32:47,511 --> 00:32:48,181
seen in his caucus,

606
00:32:48,181 --> 00:32:51,560
Shin Gay in that very very lean and then
just you know you put on the sizing k

607
00:32:51,561 --> 00:32:54,410
one however he did it,
he did it and you know,

608
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:58,400
learned out to box which was with my and
doing because especially back in those

609
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:58,401
days,

610
00:32:58,401 --> 00:33:03,401
you're talking (939) 049-0590 six a lot
of traditional karate guys weren't cross

611
00:33:04,491 --> 00:33:06,670
training and boxing like
they do these days. Yes.

612
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:10,370
Andy came from strictly a full contact
karate background, which as we said,

613
00:33:10,371 --> 00:33:14,200
no face punching but also, which is why
we said why he had such great kicks. Yeah,

614
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:16,250
because dude couldn't
punch it to the face.

615
00:33:16,251 --> 00:33:19,580
You could get really flashy with your
techniques and Andy's main kick was the

616
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,910
[inaudible] and the [inaudible]
is extraordinary. If, if,

617
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,260
if you guys who are
listening haven't seen it,

618
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,990
you know it's called the
[inaudible] because it comes
down and you're like an x.

619
00:33:26,991 --> 00:33:28,130
The heels brought down onto there,

620
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:32,990
the collarbone or key broke down to the
forehead and your wind the leg way up

621
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,090
over the opponent.
That down it comes,

622
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:39,260
one of the most brutal knockouts I ever
saw in taekwondo was his guy, herb Perez,

623
00:33:39,261 --> 00:33:41,000
who went on to win the Olympic gold medal.

624
00:33:41,001 --> 00:33:43,610
And this was that one of
the national championships,

625
00:33:43,611 --> 00:33:47,420
I believe it was in Ohio back when I was
a kid and I was just just starting to

626
00:33:47,421 --> 00:33:51,470
compete on the national level and he
was the champion and he acts kicked this

627
00:33:51,471 --> 00:33:55,970
fucking dude, I forget the dude's name,
but he was this big solid African dude.

628
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,520
The guy was just like a check
Congo living character. Just,

629
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:01,490
I wish I remembered his name because
he was a bad ass guy as well.

630
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:03,350
Also won the title at one point in time,

631
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:07,880
but he hit him with this fucking
axe kick that was so fat,

632
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:12,500
which while the Ham slam the heel
to his face, he was the same base,

633
00:34:12,501 --> 00:34:16,420
planted this like he's liquids, a Lester
size. He'll get up to taller opponents,

634
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:16,791
you know,

635
00:34:16,791 --> 00:34:20,890
the healers like one of the hardest bones
in the body and just that coming down

636
00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:25,310
on you and you called it just gotta
be so unpredictable, you know,

637
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:28,610
and it'll be fast because the
trajectory for next get to travel,

638
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:31,170
there's a lot of time for a quick
opponent to be able to capitalize a,

639
00:34:31,171 --> 00:34:34,460
her Perez was one of those guys that
actually thought about getting into MMA.

640
00:34:34,461 --> 00:34:38,420
And I think if anybody from the taekwondo
world would have been good at MMA,

641
00:34:38,421 --> 00:34:41,510
it probably would have been him because
I got to see him compete a bunch of

642
00:34:41,511 --> 00:34:44,440
times. He actually, he actually
knocked out one of my friends. Um,

643
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:47,930
he would knock out a lot of guys and
he would punch a lot of guys too. He,

644
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,700
he had like a different style,

645
00:34:49,701 --> 00:34:53,600
like this different real attacking
power style of taekwondo.

646
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:56,510
If you learned like real
boxing and learn how to sprawl,

647
00:34:56,511 --> 00:35:00,050
he would fuck a lot of guys up cause the,
the speed of his legs that,

648
00:35:00,051 --> 00:35:03,140
you mean the guys wouldn't have been able
to handle those kicks coming at their

649
00:35:03,141 --> 00:35:06,440
face. They wouldn't know it would get
there that quick. You know, it's a lot.

650
00:35:06,441 --> 00:35:09,830
A lot of it is a timing thing, you know,
it's just whether or not a guy like that,

651
00:35:09,831 --> 00:35:11,180
those high level taekwondo guys,

652
00:35:11,181 --> 00:35:14,960
if they want to spend the time and
learn all that other shit and become an

653
00:35:14,961 --> 00:35:17,270
amateur, you know, when
you get into Jujitsu,

654
00:35:17,271 --> 00:35:20,990
I don't care if you're an Olympic
gold medalist that as a white belt,

655
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:25,730
purple belt mounts you and starts choking
the fuck out of you every Tuesday and

656
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:28,640
he goes looking for you. When you
think of yourself as this bad ass,

657
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:30,890
you go to the gym and the public.
But my friend went to play.

658
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:35,410
He wants to choke the fuck out of
you like he always does. You know,

659
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:38,250
that's some humbling shit and a
lot of those guys are not willing,

660
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:39,390
which I think is really,

661
00:35:39,391 --> 00:35:42,200
really unfortunate because what
made a guy like a her Perez,

662
00:35:42,201 --> 00:35:44,340
not to use them as an example,
but when I was a kid,

663
00:35:44,341 --> 00:35:47,010
he was like one of my favorite taekwondo
guys to watch. It was like an idol.

664
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:51,360
So I bring him up. But what, what
made him so great is that, you know,

665
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:56,480
he figured out how to follow through to
like the highest level of a particular

666
00:35:56,731 --> 00:36:00,570
martial art. But the goal is
always to be an effective fighter.

667
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:05,160
You can say that it's all to compete
inside the taekwondo rule frame, but man,

668
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,060
at the root of it,

669
00:36:06,061 --> 00:36:10,400
you want to kick some dude's ass and
it's hard to accept that you're kicking

670
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:13,890
guys ask only because he's
not allowed to take you down.

671
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,390
Because if he was around
and take you down,

672
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:18,760
well then he could just fucking do that
all day and then your kicks are useless.

673
00:36:18,761 --> 00:36:20,450
Yeah.
So it's like there's,

674
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,850
there's a certain aspect of it that a
lot of those guys didn't want it except,

675
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:29,010
you know, they, they want to still think
that there, this assassin when they are,

676
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:33,240
as long as the rules are very specific.
For seven and a half years,

677
00:36:33,241 --> 00:36:36,810
I edited the Australian equivalent of
black belt magazine called Blitz magazine

678
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:39,010
and uh, you know, running battle,

679
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:42,900
the different martial arts
and the traditional arts.
And we do sequence frames,

680
00:36:42,901 --> 00:36:43,051
you know,

681
00:36:43,051 --> 00:36:46,980
to show defenses against knife attacks
and defenses against boxing and all this

682
00:36:46,981 --> 00:36:50,090
sort of stuff. And you look back
at it now after the, you know, the,

683
00:36:50,091 --> 00:36:52,920
the propagation in mixed martial arts
and the popularity of mixed martial arts

684
00:36:52,921 --> 00:36:55,080
that exposed so many of the myths.

685
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:58,080
And I flick back through some of the old
magazines. I'm like, what the fuck man,

686
00:36:58,081 --> 00:36:58,914
this shit just,

687
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,770
just would not work guys coming out
with a knife and you're going to,

688
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:05,370
oh guys coming in with the clubbing and
you look at fucking XD fence and then

689
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:08,280
you know spinning, hook it to the
guy and it's like, come on man.

690
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:10,200
There was some ridiculous shit going on.

691
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:14,940
But a lot of the guys that
would believe that shit so much,

692
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:17,640
and this was one of the things that
absolutely put me off working for the

693
00:37:17,641 --> 00:37:22,641
magazine towards the end was hating
having to write about instructors and how

694
00:37:22,891 --> 00:37:26,130
humble they were and you know
that they had no ego whatsoever.

695
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,900
And these are the same guys
that are ringing you up saying,

696
00:37:27,901 --> 00:37:29,550
I want to be on the front
cover of the magazine.

697
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:33,120
I want a poster of myself inside. I'm
going to buy five pages of advertising.

698
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:35,780
I want to check the story out and
make sure the write ups good Ben,

699
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:36,990
you got to ride out humble,

700
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,460
appreciative bowing and doing it for
very little money. And it's just like,

701
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:45,660
it's just sort of give me a very bad
taste for some traditional martial artists

702
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,540
that, that believable a lot of
their own hype. That said though,

703
00:37:48,541 --> 00:37:51,360
I'm a big fan of traditional martial arts
because I love the aesthetics of it as

704
00:37:51,361 --> 00:37:53,210
well. Traditional martial arts, uh,

705
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:58,200
much like any sort of school of philosophy
where one person knows more than you

706
00:37:58,201 --> 00:38:00,570
and they're going to teach you,
you're going to get two different types.

707
00:38:00,571 --> 00:38:03,150
You're going to get true masters.
And by true masters,

708
00:38:03,151 --> 00:38:04,440
I just mean someone who really,

709
00:38:04,441 --> 00:38:08,100
it truly is a person who has some
knowledge and they want to bestow it and

710
00:38:08,101 --> 00:38:10,320
that's the, the life they're living
in. That's the way they're living.

711
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,060
And you're going to get some charlatans.

712
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:15,420
You're going to get a lot of people
just like caught leaders, you know,

713
00:38:15,421 --> 00:38:15,711
they're in,

714
00:38:15,711 --> 00:38:18,690
there are people out there that I believe
that are legitimate spiritual leaders

715
00:38:18,691 --> 00:38:20,040
and by what they are,

716
00:38:20,041 --> 00:38:23,220
is there a person that's on a road and
they're further ahead than you? You know,

717
00:38:23,221 --> 00:38:26,010
if the guy's been living at a
Buddhist monastery, you know,

718
00:38:26,011 --> 00:38:29,730
eating a very raw vegan diet and
meditating all day for 10 years,

719
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:34,110
that's an experience that very,
very few people have ever attempted.

720
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:36,010
And if you hung out with
that guy or talk to them,

721
00:38:36,011 --> 00:38:38,860
I guarantee you can pick something
up from him. But that same token,

722
00:38:38,861 --> 00:38:39,820
there's a lot of charlatan.

723
00:38:39,821 --> 00:38:42,970
Coleen is in martial arts and there are
so many of them out there that have more

724
00:38:42,971 --> 00:38:47,470
than not more than not exactly the way
that the students look up to these guys

725
00:38:47,471 --> 00:38:51,100
and put them on a pedestal. It's
like, like that messiahs almost.

726
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,760
And it's a shame to see
a lot of instructors take
advantage of that just for

727
00:38:54,761 --> 00:38:58,620
monetary gain. And there's so many
of them out there and you know,

728
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:03,220
I've seen instructors around the world
and several stories of instructors who

729
00:39:03,221 --> 00:39:06,910
have taken advantage of students now
for sexual purposes and stuff like that.

730
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:08,710
Just because the,
the control,

731
00:39:08,711 --> 00:39:12,640
the steaming mind control they have that
they implement in those students. It's,

732
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:16,150
it's, it's, it's cultish. That's,
it's crazy man. It's really common.

733
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:20,650
It's really common that if you look up
like scandals and there's always things

734
00:39:20,651 --> 00:39:25,651
happening in karate schools to ultimate
power corrupts ultimately or absolutely

735
00:39:25,781 --> 00:39:27,910
or whatever. You know, it's, uh, it's,

736
00:39:27,911 --> 00:39:29,950
it is like being in a cult
when you have everybody going,

737
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:34,810
Usr yum can become some asshole and
really believe that shit. You know,

738
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:38,470
that's the thing that I least liked
about taekwondo when I was a child.

739
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:42,820
But in all fairness,
that intense, you know,

740
00:39:42,821 --> 00:39:46,150
yes or no sir. That is what
I needed. It disciplines.

741
00:39:46,151 --> 00:39:49,420
You mean when I had kids mind that I'd
love to get my kids in the traditional

742
00:39:49,421 --> 00:39:53,470
mosque slots just for that discipline,
that rigorous discipline. It's just, it's,

743
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:57,880
there's levels of respect. Like my
taekwondo school that I, I mean,

744
00:39:57,950 --> 00:40:02,260
I literally spent my entire life from
age 15 until I started doing standup

745
00:40:02,261 --> 00:40:04,480
comedy.
That's all I did was fight with.

746
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:09,400
All I did was taekwondo and kickboxing
and Muay Thai towards the end. More time,

747
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,980
kickboxing when I was 22 my
last fights or kickboxing,

748
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:14,740
but my whole life was
all this taekwondo shit.

749
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:18,920
And I would go from this world
of very little order, you know,

750
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,550
which my life was to all of a sudden,
you know,

751
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:24,850
some guys that fucking screaming at
you and you know, so yes sir, you know,

752
00:40:24,851 --> 00:40:28,570
and he's saying you go and then this,
this whole bowing and this respect thing.

753
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:31,090
And then, and then actually
like becoming a black belt,

754
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:34,270
like all of that to me was
like, this was like, it, it, it,

755
00:40:34,271 --> 00:40:39,271
it forced me into thinking at a higher
level at forced me into like composing

756
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:43,560
myself, presenting myself
on a higher level that I,

757
00:40:43,561 --> 00:40:47,830
I had a higher calling to answer to.
The funny thing back then as well,

758
00:40:47,831 --> 00:40:50,590
I remember talking to you about this and
when we did the voice versus, you know,

759
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:54,670
was the, the uh, the, the, the uh,

760
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:58,150
the black power, how, how much people
have thought of black belts back then.

761
00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:00,990
I remember, and I've told you this story
when all the c level is still looking,

762
00:41:00,991 --> 00:41:02,950
I was 12 years old.
I remember at high school,

763
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:05,920
kid come up to me and we'll talking
about karate and being a black belt.

764
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:08,230
And he's like, yeah, you
know, here in Australia,

765
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:11,200
you're not allowed to be any more
than a fifth Dan black belt or you're

766
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:14,590
considered a lethal weapon. You've
got to leave the country. I was like,

767
00:41:14,591 --> 00:41:17,010
what do you believe that shit back then,
while I was in the,

768
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:19,930
I was in a plane with boss Rutan and uh,
we are,

769
00:41:19,931 --> 00:41:23,700
we're getting on board and the woman
goes, where do I know that guy from? I go,

770
00:41:23,701 --> 00:41:25,210
that's the boss Rutan I go,

771
00:41:25,211 --> 00:41:28,480
this is a former UFC heavyweight champion
when the greatest martial artist ever,

772
00:41:28,481 --> 00:41:30,280
he's a legend. And she goes, oh,

773
00:41:30,281 --> 00:41:35,270
well my boyfriend is a big into martial
arts. I go, yeah. And she goes, yeah,

774
00:41:35,271 --> 00:41:39,940
yeah. He actually had to get his hands
registered. Jackson said this, right.

775
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:43,520
So I go over it, I'm a fucking asshole.
Of course I have to go over it. And I go,

776
00:41:43,521 --> 00:41:44,120
boss,

777
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:49,120
the woman over there said
that her boyfriend's a big
fan of a mixed martial arts

778
00:41:49,251 --> 00:41:51,950
and he's such a bad motherfucker.
He had to get his hands registered.

779
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:55,720
And of course, you know, boss ruin. It's
like this is not true. Just not true.

780
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:58,770
I don't do that. Don't do that.
What tells you this? He's liar.

781
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:04,430
So that's so well he was pretty
polite about it, but man,

782
00:42:04,431 --> 00:42:08,540
he couldn't stop til it gets
fucking guy. Come on, come on.

783
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:13,390
You know he's boss. Boss ruin is
a killer man. And you, you know,

784
00:42:13,391 --> 00:42:16,580
you ignite that spark inside of him
with some bullshit and you know,

785
00:42:16,581 --> 00:42:21,250
especially a guy who's
dedicated his entire life to
fighting. You can't do that.

786
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,410
The boss ruin some troopers out there.
Maybe even crazy.

787
00:42:24,411 --> 00:42:26,690
Even people that are getting
awarded these. Dan's,

788
00:42:26,691 --> 00:42:31,270
there was a guy in Australia and you know
he was like 45 46 years old and was a

789
00:42:31,271 --> 00:42:36,271
10th Dan Indian Jitu 10th 10
fucking Ninja where all the shit,

790
00:42:36,711 --> 00:42:41,210
the fucking fucking shit that they were
a shurikens and all that sort of stuff.

791
00:42:41,211 --> 00:42:45,170
It's like a 10th Dan, you're a 45
year old, 10th Dan White Ninja.

792
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:51,410
Who the fuck is, I mean is there
a real school of Ninja tune me?

793
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:55,520
Can you really directly studying in
Jitsu cause wasn't being a Ninja,

794
00:42:55,521 --> 00:43:00,230
being an assassin. It was a secretive
to some shit. They just tell why people,

795
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:01,041
you know,

796
00:43:01,041 --> 00:43:06,041
what the fuck is the fucking call stricken
and the fucking Catana are and all

797
00:43:07,161 --> 00:43:12,120
the rest of the shit crazy man.
I don't even need you to has a Carter.

798
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:15,050
There was one guy that I
was absolutely fascinated.

799
00:43:15,051 --> 00:43:18,770
This is before when I was
younger I hadn't developed my,

800
00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:22,310
my current strategy of using
people as science projects.

801
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:26,060
There's some people that are
like, I decide, well this
guy is my science project.

802
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:27,670
Like what's this guy doing?
This is,

803
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:31,670
I'm going to study him every couple of
years and tune in to him and see what's

804
00:43:31,671 --> 00:43:32,031
going on.

805
00:43:32,031 --> 00:43:34,820
I didn't realize I was already doing
that with this guy but there was this one

806
00:43:34,821 --> 00:43:38,420
guy who was a Ninja master and he was
in all these magazines is black belt

807
00:43:38,421 --> 00:43:40,970
magazines and this guy
was completely crazy.

808
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:43,700
This guy was drinking miso soup
in the morning and you know,

809
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:48,230
eating traditional Japanese food all day
and then doing his Ninja training and

810
00:43:48,231 --> 00:43:51,430
like, he would have all these articles,
like, what would a Ninja do if

811
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:55,510
I got comes at you with a stick?
Oh fuck.

812
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,960
You can't fuck with an engine
with a stick to that said,

813
00:43:57,961 --> 00:43:59,540
my uncle due to cough was a fucking bomb.

814
00:43:59,541 --> 00:44:04,130
Helga was American Ninja back in the
ideas, man. I met that guy to cough a man.

815
00:44:04,131 --> 00:44:06,770
That was fucking awesome. Um, you
know, the last time I did your show,

816
00:44:06,771 --> 00:44:07,950
I did the voice versus,

817
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:12,020
and you and I sat and we talked about
black dudes doing Kung Fu and the park.

818
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:16,070
Y'All did a lot of black dudes doing
Kung Fu in the park. I very mad at me.

819
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:20,360
Really? Yeah. You know, because
I was making fun of like,
what would they do is not,

820
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:20,840
there's nothing.

821
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:24,920
Not saying that hitting someone using
Kung Fu techniques wouldn't be effective.

822
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:26,000
Of course,
it'd be effective.

823
00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:30,470
What we're saying is this method of
training that these guys employed in the

824
00:44:30,471 --> 00:44:32,400
park is,
is basically

825
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:37,580
a really antiquated old way of
developing techniques for martial arts.

826
00:44:37,651 --> 00:44:41,250
And what it is is one guy pretends to
hit you and then you pretend you get out

827
00:44:41,251 --> 00:44:43,020
of the way and then hit him
with a bunch of other shit.

828
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:46,410
But that stuff doesn't really work
because when someone comes in to hit you,

829
00:44:46,411 --> 00:44:49,740
they don't just come in and hit you
like that. They want to figure you out.

830
00:44:49,741 --> 00:44:51,990
They moved, they, they've, they faint. You

831
00:44:53,770 --> 00:44:56,040
don't want to wrap my point as well.
I say it's not,

832
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:59,950
it's not effective to train that way. No,
it's not effective to you step forward.

833
00:44:59,951 --> 00:45:03,210
The guy throws a bunch of, you know,
so the guy's like, yeah, Joe Rogan.

834
00:45:03,211 --> 00:45:04,310
How you could say that out,

835
00:45:04,350 --> 00:45:07,620
hit you with a monkey fist in your face
and your eyes water and you're telling

836
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:10,920
me it ain't going to hurt. It
will. Most certainly will hurt.

837
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,970
Please don't hit me with a monkey Paul
to the face. That's not what I'm saying.

838
00:45:14,971 --> 00:45:17,910
When I make fun of your
training. I'm saying that's
not the way to do it anymore.

839
00:45:18,110 --> 00:45:22,980
It's, it's silly to this. This is about
the fight. What you do as a sport.

840
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:25,350
Shut the fuck ups.
I said to me,

841
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:30,180
the stuff that works on trained killers
is the best stuff and any you crazy kung

842
00:45:30,181 --> 00:45:32,430
fu guys,
it's still think you can hang in MMA,

843
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:35,880
get in there with just Kung Fu training
and the high level guys are going to

844
00:45:35,881 --> 00:45:38,140
take you down and they're going to choke
the fuck out of you and they're going

845
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:40,590
to leg kick you and they're going to
blast you. That's just the way it is.

846
00:45:40,770 --> 00:45:43,230
You have to train in
mixed martial arts to be,

847
00:45:43,231 --> 00:45:46,960
to be able to compete with those guys
because it's the best style of fighting

848
00:45:46,961 --> 00:45:48,360
and that's exactly right.
It's what I was going to say.

849
00:45:48,361 --> 00:45:52,500
I mean you look at something
like wingsuit, winterim,
tracking hands, sticky hands.

850
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:55,790
There's a few things about that than we
used in self defense that effective you

851
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:56,700
in close range.

852
00:45:56,850 --> 00:45:59,610
But if you're going to rely on just that
sheet during a mixed martial arts fight

853
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:03,510
and try sticky hands against Anderson
Silva. True. True. But you know,

854
00:46:03,511 --> 00:46:07,230
if you're in a fucking room where you're
getting your coat and some guy's drunk

855
00:46:07,231 --> 00:46:10,500
for sure you can use sticky hands
to then sit up. There's guys,

856
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:13,350
there's some of those guys that can
fuck up pat on that and you can do those

857
00:46:13,351 --> 00:46:16,230
chain fist to your face. That
shit's real. And this way,

858
00:46:16,231 --> 00:46:19,260
Bruce Lee was the innovator yet again,
cause personally started in when children,

859
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:23,070
which by the way was develop our none
when you can actually was invented by

860
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:27,240
chick. Yeah. Yeah. Real in
tune was invented by a nun.

861
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:31,350
Oh you told me this before this though.
I don't know the full history.

862
00:46:31,351 --> 00:46:32,310
I just know that a woman,

863
00:46:32,311 --> 00:46:35,880
a chicken invented when children and
then of course you know most of the great

864
00:46:35,881 --> 00:46:39,450
masters of it where we're men yet man
was Bruce Lee's teacher of course.

865
00:46:39,451 --> 00:46:44,240
And that she probably got tired of
Dude's trying to fuck her virgin. Yeah.

866
00:46:44,310 --> 00:46:45,950
If you're,
if you're a chick and you're,

867
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:49,560
your whole style fighting is
based on staying in one line.

868
00:46:49,770 --> 00:46:52,530
I mean that's obviously a check.
Did not want to spread her legs.

869
00:46:53,570 --> 00:46:56,640
And then he went against the wall,
very techniques with the kicks,

870
00:46:57,120 --> 00:47:00,360
very short little kicks till the bottom
of the just snapping techniques as what

871
00:47:00,361 --> 00:47:03,000
Bruce Lee was smart, you know,
he, he then realized, okay,

872
00:47:03,001 --> 00:47:06,120
we need to him gave him the space and all
the shell in wouldn't dummy stuff that

873
00:47:06,121 --> 00:47:09,660
they practice on or there's trapping
hands and you know, from there though,

874
00:47:09,661 --> 00:47:13,250
he started to cross train hills the first
real one to to do it. He was a genius.

875
00:47:13,251 --> 00:47:15,780
He was way ahead of his
time. And people, you know,

876
00:47:15,781 --> 00:47:19,240
they look at Bruce Lee movies and
they're fun and everything, but the tech,

877
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:22,320
if you know really about Bruce Lee,
the techniques that he used in his movies,

878
00:47:22,321 --> 00:47:23,390
he just use,
because they look cool.

879
00:47:23,690 --> 00:47:27,890
Like his fighting style
of g Cuno the Dragon,

880
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:30,190
the first time that
mixed martial arts was on

881
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:34,540
movies, right when he
fought, uh, uh, was it, um,

882
00:47:34,790 --> 00:47:36,580
somehow who was the guy who fought,
right?

883
00:47:36,581 --> 00:47:39,380
Takes him down and arm bars and they got
a four ounce gloves on. I was like, yeah,

884
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:43,030
it can mixed martial arts here in the
70s we're seeing it on the screen.

885
00:47:43,031 --> 00:47:45,970
Who Know, who started to train him and
grappling, right? Judo is, you know,

886
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,080
Jean Lynnville out, you know, he
was into all this different shit.

887
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:53,010
If you don't know judo,
gene Lebell is a mixed martial law,

888
00:47:53,011 --> 00:47:56,950
is legend and just a real great guy,
a real character. But he's also like,

889
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:59,170
there's bear of a man,
you know,

890
00:47:59,171 --> 00:48:03,580
he's got these giant hands and even
in his advanced age that he is now,

891
00:48:03,581 --> 00:48:08,080
he's still, he's a beast. He's
a fucking beast. Back then,

892
00:48:08,110 --> 00:48:12,640
my God, back when he was in
a a US champion judo player,

893
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:15,400
I mean cause an animal man,
he was a fucking beat suck.

894
00:48:15,410 --> 00:48:19,410
So a guy like Bruce Lee who didn't
know any grappling, you know,

895
00:48:19,610 --> 00:48:20,830
well let me show you something here.

896
00:48:21,370 --> 00:48:24,880
But in the 135 pounds and you get that
motherfucker hoist and you through the

897
00:48:24,881 --> 00:48:27,720
air, all that trapping hands is
doing nothing. Nothing at all. Yeah,

898
00:48:27,790 --> 00:48:29,840
he's going to hit you with the earth.
You know,

899
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:33,250
judo guys are the scariest guys ever
to fight. If you're wearing clothes,

900
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:35,320
because this is grab a
hold of your clothes,

901
00:48:35,321 --> 00:48:37,450
it's fucking throw you through
the air on your head. Judo.

902
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:39,260
And a lot of people
underestimate Trudeau as well,

903
00:48:39,261 --> 00:48:43,180
which I think is an awesome marsh, right?
Guy Ms. Guy said to me one day, he goes,

904
00:48:43,181 --> 00:48:47,380
brother, he goes, I judo throw you on
the carpet, you're going to a hospital,

905
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:50,620
I judo throw you on the street, you're
going to fucking morgue. So for me,

906
00:48:50,621 --> 00:48:53,530
that summed it up perfectly.
That's Judah.

907
00:48:53,531 --> 00:48:57,370
That's how impressive judo can be done
by a good, you know, good student of it.

908
00:48:57,430 --> 00:49:02,260
Oh yeah, it's fucking lethal. Any real
high level wrestling judo is good.

909
00:49:02,261 --> 00:49:03,280
But you know,

910
00:49:03,370 --> 00:49:08,080
if a guy fucking really
knows how to wrestle and gets
your back and suplexes you

911
00:49:08,081 --> 00:49:11,250
on the canvas, you're fucked.
You know what I mean? It's, it's,

912
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:16,180
it's anybody who can control your body
and then slam you to the ground, you know,

913
00:49:16,181 --> 00:49:19,120
and there's stuff that happens
in the UFC fight and it, it,

914
00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:22,220
the guy survives it and the guy will
be okay, like a perfect example.

915
00:49:22,221 --> 00:49:24,670
Is that random and fade or flat or random.

916
00:49:24,671 --> 00:49:27,220
And suplex fatal or right
onto his fucking head.

917
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,080
Luckily for fate or this is on
a padded floor and you know,

918
00:49:32,090 --> 00:49:35,830
there's like give to the flight. I don't
know how, give me the Flores and pride,

919
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:40,510
but uh, the UFC is definitely got some
give to it. It's changed over the ears.

920
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:42,760
It's changed over the years.
Yes. He got a lot of times I'm a,

921
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:45,880
it fucked when it got from that
day, but he recovered, you know,

922
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:47,920
it's fucking swinging and
eventually one economy.

923
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:50,250
I caught him the Camorra shortly after.
Yeah.

924
00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:54,660
But what I was going to say was that,
that was on the concrete days. Forget it.

925
00:49:54,690 --> 00:49:56,230
You're,
you're hitting him with the earth.

926
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:59,290
It's like hitting it with a giant
rock that weighs 300 pounds.

927
00:49:59,291 --> 00:50:01,890
There's two of you flying through
the air, you know, and you're,

928
00:50:01,891 --> 00:50:05,380
you're slamming into this earth. Have you
ever been in a self defense situation?

929
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:09,720
Not since I was a kid. Not really.
You know, once I'm fear factor,

930
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:12,580
some guy got in my face, but it wasn't
like I didn't really have to do anything.

931
00:50:12,581 --> 00:50:15,660
I just grabbed it. I got them into Thai
clinch. Actually that's what I did to him.

932
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:19,600
I'm like, no, it was like 16 months ago,

933
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:24,250
16 months ago, man. Really?
So we're out and about,

934
00:50:24,370 --> 00:50:28,100
um, some friends have some coffee, we're

935
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:30,540
in a belt with some friends
and uh, you know, I,

936
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:34,670
and I honor her sister and her cousin and
her brother in law and we were driving

937
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:39,200
back home and I'm sort of parked at the
lights and this guys and as I just got

938
00:50:39,201 --> 00:50:40,250
my brand new car,
by the way,

939
00:50:40,550 --> 00:50:42,540
and the girls are sitting in
the backseat and was Irene who?

940
00:50:42,541 --> 00:50:45,770
She started brother in law and her cousin
was in the front seat with me and his

941
00:50:45,771 --> 00:50:49,250
guys has come across the street and
has gone on the window of the car.

942
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:52,220
The gills are fucking freaking out.
He's got this fucking smack my window.

943
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:56,930
All right. I thought he'd
broken something. So I'll
pull my car over, gotten out,

944
00:50:56,940 --> 00:51:00,800
check the window and he's there sort of
like being a fucking clown. I'm like,

945
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:03,810
the fuck man, you fucking hit my car.
My girlfriend in the back of this,

946
00:51:03,811 --> 00:51:06,620
he's still fucking chicks in the back
and I started to walk towards him.

947
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:10,190
He ran away. I'm like, fuck this man.
I'm getting an apology out of the sky.

948
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,250
So I chased the, I'll just, I'll
just fucking flipped out, man.

949
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:17,750
We ain't fucking bullies. I chased him
for an apology. I was that fucking angry.

950
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:22,250
Chased him for apology, wrap the street
and uh, found him and he must have been,

951
00:51:22,310 --> 00:51:23,270
I don't want to drug use on,

952
00:51:23,271 --> 00:51:26,140
he's sitting in the fucking ground like
he's going like this back and forth

953
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:29,630
rocking, right. My two of the fuck
he hit my car. You fucking freak out.

954
00:51:29,631 --> 00:51:32,990
My girlfriend and her sister, like,
what the fuck is wrong with you man?

955
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:36,170
You're wondering on the street, you
get, get fucking run over. You know,

956
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:40,280
he was like, concern for him was concerned
by his mom. I was like, I'm like, dude,

957
00:51:40,281 --> 00:51:43,430
you fucked up. I'm usually like that
because it's stupid. I'm like, dude,

958
00:51:43,431 --> 00:51:46,290
you gotta fuck yourself. I'm getting
hurt. Run over, run over her.

959
00:51:46,490 --> 00:51:49,640
He bounces up and just starts fucking
throwing punches at me and I'm like,

960
00:51:49,641 --> 00:51:52,670
Oh shit, here we go. All right, so
blockies for those that don't know,

961
00:51:52,671 --> 00:51:55,550
I'd studied more Thai for about three
and a half years back in Australia with

962
00:51:55,551 --> 00:51:58,520
mark [inaudible].
So the Moitai lessons came flooding back,

963
00:51:59,210 --> 00:52:02,120
some blocking his punches,
blocking his punches. And um,

964
00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:05,150
I remember that mark had taught
me a technique back in the day,

965
00:52:05,151 --> 00:52:08,420
which is not a Moitai technique, but
mark is uh, uh, a bouncer for many,

966
00:52:08,421 --> 00:52:11,900
many years and it's actually his stories
that my best selling book Bouncer, uh,

967
00:52:11,901 --> 00:52:15,070
were based on and he caught
it, bounce bounces. You got
a book called bounce? Yeah,

968
00:52:15,071 --> 00:52:16,040
my,
I've done four books.

969
00:52:16,041 --> 00:52:19,820
My first one was 99 called bounce and
based on real life nightclub bouncer

970
00:52:19,821 --> 00:52:23,840
stories, no shit and cute. Can I get it
on Amazon or, yeah, you can get on Amazon.

971
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,110
Yeah, try. Amazon should still
be someone in his own idea.

972
00:52:26,111 --> 00:52:29,450
He wrote books this syllable,
that's pretty bad ass. Hey,

973
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:31,630
my taught me this choke
or the bouncers choke.

974
00:52:31,850 --> 00:52:34,400
We're basically just shoot your hand
out and rent the fingers around.

975
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:38,050
The larynx and just looking to squeeze
as the roadhouse. The roadhouse bounces,

976
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:41,060
drag queen. He called it something
like fucking blocking. I thought, fuck,

977
00:52:41,061 --> 00:52:41,894
what am I going to do?

978
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:46,070
I'm just going to fucking
go for the bouncers tried
to shut it out and was like,

979
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:50,000
I got him perfectly start squeezing
his larynx and as I'm squeezing him,

980
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:53,870
he's like choking or put him down on
the ground and I'm on top of him still

981
00:52:53,871 --> 00:52:56,570
choking him. I'm like, you're
going to fucking calm down now.

982
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:59,930
I don't want any trouble. Just
fucking calm down and I'll let you go.

983
00:53:00,350 --> 00:53:04,520
All with the fucking Jedi Knight Dude.
Fucking around his larynx. I'm squeezing.

984
00:53:04,521 --> 00:53:06,320
I could almost feel my
fingers coming together, man.

985
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:08,500
This guy's face started
to witness his defense.

986
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:11,000
Is he trying to get a hand in there? No,
no, no. He's just on the ground. Just,

987
00:53:11,010 --> 00:53:13,870
just wondering why the fuck aren't I
breathing at the moment. I'm on top of it.

988
00:53:13,871 --> 00:53:17,930
I'm a heavy guy pulling your
hands. Nothing. No. Nothing
at all. Nothing at all.

989
00:53:17,931 --> 00:53:21,350
Terrible technique. Yeah, nothing at all
song. I weighed a lot more than he did.

990
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:23,960
Okay. And then I show once in a lot
more, cause this is a pretty decent guy,

991
00:53:23,961 --> 00:53:26,700
but it might be had, I'll probably
had, would have had 12 kilograms on it.

992
00:53:27,030 --> 00:53:31,890
Let's say, what did you learn from
this? There's more, there's more weight.

993
00:53:32,130 --> 00:53:36,120
So he's on the ground. He got, he's
trying to not, so I'll let him up.

994
00:53:36,121 --> 00:53:38,370
I might do just fuck off.
Enjoy your night.

995
00:53:38,610 --> 00:53:41,040
But this time Irene and her cousin and
her brother and we'll come around the

996
00:53:41,041 --> 00:53:41,760
corner.

997
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:46,590
So this guy walks off and then I walk
off to join them and then I turned around

998
00:53:46,591 --> 00:53:49,710
and he's below a fence and he takes a
punch at me and actually caught me cause I

999
00:53:49,711 --> 00:53:53,070
wasn't expecting it grazed me with like a,
I think you missed the,

1000
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:57,060
he's watched or something grabs me. It had
to be grazed on my, on my, my, my, my uh,

1001
00:53:57,061 --> 00:53:58,980
foreign and he's walked off again.

1002
00:53:59,490 --> 00:54:04,260
And then for some reason he turns
around and he's about 20 feet away.

1003
00:54:04,590 --> 00:54:09,300
Just starts going, it takes a run up
for me. It takes a fucking run up.

1004
00:54:09,570 --> 00:54:11,850
And I'm like, Oh shit. Irene
standing right behind me.

1005
00:54:11,851 --> 00:54:15,630
There's no way I want this guy to start
punching me, get him on speed, Lsd,

1006
00:54:15,631 --> 00:54:18,750
something is on,
so I'm just thinking that was dean.

1007
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:23,480
I don't know what else do they give any
people in Australia comes charging you?

1008
00:54:23,490 --> 00:54:24,770
I sit myself and then just,

1009
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:30,020
I just from kicked him off
the real leaders boom to
the heart is a folding half

1010
00:54:30,301 --> 00:54:33,710
man folding house and he's too in
your front rainy and I was tying,

1011
00:54:33,711 --> 00:54:37,860
there's some boom into his chest and
his two mates came around and helped him

1012
00:54:37,861 --> 00:54:42,090
off and he was fucked up man. Wow.
W did you learn anything from us?

1013
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:44,960
Probably not to chase the guy
for an apology next time. Not to.

1014
00:54:45,130 --> 00:54:48,610
Do you really need an apologia some
from some causes in a weird mood man.

1015
00:54:48,611 --> 00:54:51,720
It's just like a, hey bullies, I
cannot stand bullies and I stand there.

1016
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:55,080
I'm not a violent person and
I cannot stand bullies and
it was just, it was fine.

1017
00:54:55,110 --> 00:54:57,540
But I think it's very
important in any situation.

1018
00:54:57,570 --> 00:55:01,970
And he real live situation like
that to always think row the pop the

1019
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:06,300
probabilities and possibilities into the
old computer and come out with what's

1020
00:55:06,301 --> 00:55:10,200
worst case scenario here. Worst case
scenario, it could be pretty fucking bad.

1021
00:55:10,201 --> 00:55:12,030
You could die,
you could get stabbed,

1022
00:55:12,031 --> 00:55:15,330
you could have done some stall and break
your leg as you're chasing after him.

1023
00:55:15,331 --> 00:55:19,960
Then he beats you to death. Look,
it's not good. That's not good man.

1024
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:23,880
Oh yes. My silly story ever is
not even about martial arts.

1025
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:27,120
Do you mind if I tell you a blind
date story? I would love it. Okay,

1026
00:55:27,330 --> 00:55:30,960
so I'm so thankful to talk about martial
arts. We just nuts. I didn't plan on it.

1027
00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:34,440
We just started this way and we just, you
know, that's what it would, it became,

1028
00:55:34,441 --> 00:55:35,160
let me tell you,

1029
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:37,950
I'm so happy now cause like Irene is
let the best woman in the world and you

1030
00:55:37,951 --> 00:55:40,680
know, we're engaged now. I proposed to
her in Rome like a couple of weeks ago.

1031
00:55:40,890 --> 00:55:43,680
I'm so thrilled because some of the
experiences I had with women in the past,

1032
00:55:43,681 --> 00:55:45,930
Joe, seriously, let me tell
you about this blind date.

1033
00:55:45,931 --> 00:55:49,620
I never used to go on blind dates and he
used to work on radio on a very popular

1034
00:55:49,621 --> 00:55:51,090
station in Melbourne called Kicks Fm.

1035
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:55,320
And because I had this nice voice that
everyone thinks that I still think is

1036
00:55:55,321 --> 00:55:55,621
that good,

1037
00:55:55,621 --> 00:55:58,950
but I used to have gills ringing the
studio all the time asking me to go out

1038
00:55:58,951 --> 00:56:01,080
with it. I don't think your voice
is good. No, I never locked my,

1039
00:56:01,081 --> 00:56:03,750
what do you call yourself? The voice.
I don't, I was given that nickname.

1040
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:08,070
But You keep it. I keep it to
Twitter name. She stuck with it.

1041
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:09,270
I stuck with it.
There was,

1042
00:56:09,330 --> 00:56:12,480
give him to me by Andy Raymond
on Fox sports in Australia.

1043
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:14,640
Someone was asking me about that.
It's always good to have a nickname,

1044
00:56:14,670 --> 00:56:18,300
which is was good name. It works.
Um, I'm sorry, go ahead. Yeah, cool.

1045
00:56:18,301 --> 00:56:21,030
This is a cool story. You gonna like
this one. It's a bit of a long story,

1046
00:56:21,031 --> 00:56:22,560
but you'll be entertained.
So anyway,

1047
00:56:22,561 --> 00:56:25,510
there's girls used to run the radio
station every day wanting to go out to go

1048
00:56:25,511 --> 00:56:27,940
out when it's go out and like,
no, no, never that. This one,

1049
00:56:27,941 --> 00:56:31,000
she rang up and her name was Elizabeth
and she had the hottest fucking voice on

1050
00:56:31,001 --> 00:56:34,900
the phone. Beautiful voice and, and,
and I thought to myself, fuck man,

1051
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,160
I don't even get any action lately.

1052
00:56:36,161 --> 00:56:39,310
It might as well go on a blind date and
just see if I can maybe ways chicks is

1053
00:56:39,311 --> 00:56:44,170
hot and fucking get my, get my dick wet.
So Elizabeth rang up and I'm like, ah,

1054
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:47,920
yeah. Okay cool. Maybe we'll go out. Tell
me, what do you look like? She was like,

1055
00:56:47,921 --> 00:56:52,720
I'm blonde and I've got a beach body and
blue eyes. I'm like, all right, cool.

1056
00:56:52,721 --> 00:56:56,800
We're good. Let's, let's hook up.
Let's go out. So night comes to go out,

1057
00:56:56,801 --> 00:56:59,080
my first blind date ever,
I drive to her house,

1058
00:56:59,081 --> 00:57:01,120
which is up in the fucking
sticks in the middle of nowhere.

1059
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:02,830
I'm thinking to myself,
this guy,

1060
00:57:02,831 --> 00:57:04,810
but if he fucking hot cause
I'm driving all this way,

1061
00:57:05,410 --> 00:57:08,350
pull up at her house pack
in the gravel driveway,

1062
00:57:08,770 --> 00:57:13,770
front door opens and out walks this thing
that she looked like she should have

1063
00:57:15,311 --> 00:57:18,640
been living under a fucking bridge.
Okay. If she had a beach body,

1064
00:57:18,641 --> 00:57:22,030
it was the body of a fucking
beached whale or blonde greasy hair,

1065
00:57:22,031 --> 00:57:24,730
acne on her fucking face.
She's wearing this like blech.

1066
00:57:24,731 --> 00:57:26,290
Surely sort of dressed us,

1067
00:57:26,410 --> 00:57:29,440
draping on a lot fucking more
Tisha but not thin more teacher.

1068
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:33,100
This girl's like twice my size.
Manage a fucking beast. Cut to you.

1069
00:57:33,101 --> 00:57:36,970
Naked White as right fluorescent lights,

1070
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:39,670
Europe boning her and this popping in your

1071
00:57:41,770 --> 00:57:43,630
seventies music day.
She walked in,

1072
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:47,530
I should have put the foot on
the gas then and gone do, do, do.

1073
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:51,100
No, no. She walked out.

1074
00:57:51,550 --> 00:57:54,400
She was in barefoot walking on the gravel
driveway holding still letters in her

1075
00:57:54,401 --> 00:57:57,190
hand. I'm like this fucking dirty bitch
of the duty free going to get in my car.

1076
00:57:57,191 --> 00:58:01,480
Now she hops in the car and we're driving
into town because I booked a Sushi

1077
00:58:01,481 --> 00:58:04,840
restaurant and a movie and then to go to
a nightclub that my made and just open

1078
00:58:04,841 --> 00:58:08,650
up the sliding, I say I'll be right
back. I forgot something else still.

1079
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:11,200
And I still am so much of a gentleman
that I just, I couldn't do it man.

1080
00:58:11,201 --> 00:58:13,270
I couldn't bring myself
to just drive off on her.

1081
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:16,750
So driving into town and it was raining
and the reason I can remember it was

1082
00:58:16,751 --> 00:58:19,690
raining cause cause I had the windows
up and the reason I remember that is

1083
00:58:19,691 --> 00:58:20,524
because I'm driving.
I'm like

1084
00:58:22,780 --> 00:58:27,780
Oh this chick reaped of the worst
fucking beo you can imagine bro.

1085
00:58:29,530 --> 00:58:33,070
Imagine going to the gym for a week
and not showering. She fucking writ.

1086
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:35,610
So I'm driving one hand on the wheel.
How many years ago was this?

1087
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:39,190
This is a 2012 2011 years ago.

1088
00:58:39,490 --> 00:58:43,060
One Hand on the wheel smelling my other
hand to try and get rid of her fucking

1089
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:45,570
smell pong and up my car.
So getting into town,

1090
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:48,250
I thought fuck the Sushi restaurant are
going to spend money on Sushi for this

1091
00:58:48,251 --> 00:58:50,890
pig and then take a Tgi Fridays.
Alright,

1092
00:58:51,430 --> 00:58:54,310
so we're going to Tgi Friday's and we've
got to move. We were going to go see,

1093
00:58:54,430 --> 00:58:56,950
and I hate missing the trailers to movies.
I'm like fucking Elizabeth.

1094
00:58:56,951 --> 00:58:58,240
Finish your dinner in half an hour.

1095
00:58:58,420 --> 00:59:00,820
Movie starts at eight 30 we're
going to get a films. Okay.

1096
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:03,580
You think it chicks on a date and
she's trying to impress you. She'll,

1097
00:59:03,590 --> 00:59:05,380
she'll get a,
a decent dinner but nothing,

1098
00:59:05,381 --> 00:59:09,370
be sure doesn't fucking brontosaurus
burger baby back ribs. Right.

1099
00:59:09,430 --> 00:59:12,460
And when they brought it to where you
think this fucking pig had never seen food

1100
00:59:12,461 --> 00:59:13,130
before,

1101
00:59:13,130 --> 00:59:18,130
she was like scooping shit into her
mouth and I'm just watching be muddled

1102
00:59:19,001 --> 00:59:20,860
going.
What the fuck is this chick doing?

1103
00:59:21,290 --> 00:59:24,410
Five minutes to go before
the movie starts. I'm like,
all right Lisa, you've done,

1104
00:59:24,411 --> 00:59:28,310
you finished. No, I want dessert.
She says, I'm like, all right, fuck.

1105
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:31,820
So she orders dessert.
This like chocolate turtle thing.

1106
00:59:31,821 --> 00:59:35,570
You get a t jars or fudging cream
and ice cream and chocolate.

1107
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:39,170
She's Scottish thing, like she'd never
seen a dessert in a life and trust me,

1108
00:59:39,290 --> 00:59:43,940
this fucking troll, it's in a lot of
desserts. She finishes up, I pay the bill.

1109
00:59:44,090 --> 00:59:46,070
I like having a chip, goes through
a person lace, but fucking,

1110
00:59:46,071 --> 00:59:46,881
she didn't go for a purse.

1111
00:59:46,881 --> 00:59:51,881
I slam and 50 bucks on the table
like the gesture the first yesterday.

1112
00:59:52,970 --> 00:59:54,080
I like the gesture,
but it's just your,

1113
00:59:54,081 --> 00:59:56,360
I appreciate we're going up
the escalators to the movies.

1114
00:59:56,420 --> 00:59:59,780
She's just seeding this too, cause
fucking dinner, right? She grabs my arm.

1115
00:59:59,781 --> 01:00:04,030
She goes, oh, I want a slushie.
I'm like, oh wow. I want a slushie.

1116
01:00:04,490 --> 01:00:08,960
Put the fuck's a slushie. She
doesn't even say opera. I swear.

1117
01:00:09,130 --> 01:00:12,500
Oh my God. Child. She's points
to a picture of a slurpee.

1118
01:00:12,501 --> 01:00:16,220
We call it in Australia and she goes,
[inaudible] points and grants.

1119
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,260
So I go to the candy bow.

1120
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:23,320
She went to pop a chop top ice cream at
big box of fucking popcorn and a coke

1121
01:00:24,531 --> 01:00:27,650
slurpee. It doesn't reach for her
money. I get nothing. All Right,

1122
01:00:27,651 --> 01:00:30,560
put 20 bucks in the fucking popcorn
counter. Sitting in the movies,

1123
01:00:30,561 --> 01:00:34,130
watching some romantic fucking Julia
Roberts film these bitches smelling up the

1124
01:00:34,131 --> 01:00:34,964
cinema.

1125
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:40,010
She is dipping her ice cream into the
popcorn and eating it right and then

1126
01:00:40,011 --> 01:00:43,670
sleeping on this fucking slurpee.
What? She's pumping up the cinema.

1127
01:00:43,910 --> 01:00:45,900
I'm texting my mate on the phone going do,

1128
01:00:45,901 --> 01:00:49,910
there's no way I'm being in that bring
this fucking pink dog to your nightclub.

1129
01:00:49,911 --> 01:00:51,500
I'm going to get rid of earth.
So you another time.

1130
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:53,810
So the movie finishes and she's like,
oh,

1131
01:00:53,811 --> 01:00:56,510
are we going to go to your mate's
nightclub? I'm like, yeah, Nah,

1132
01:00:56,540 --> 01:00:59,810
he's not there tonight. And
shots, we'll go another time.

1133
01:00:59,811 --> 01:01:04,100
How about I drop you home? So driving a
high and I'm thinking to myself, fuck,

1134
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:07,640
this fucking animal is going
to go for the good night kiss.

1135
01:01:07,910 --> 01:01:09,890
If she goes to the goodnight kiss,
I'm fucked.

1136
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:13,380
She'll pick me like fucking Hulk
Hogan pinned me down and kiss me some.

1137
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:16,940
I think Michael Think, how do you get
out of the goodnight kiss with his pig?

1138
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:19,910
And then I started, I thought,
Ooh, bit of reverse psychology.

1139
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:25,580
So I start talking to her about kissing
deliberately. Yeah, I love kissing.

1140
01:01:26,030 --> 01:01:30,800
I'm a, I'm a good kisser. It's of my
specialty is one of my fucking awesome.

1141
01:01:30,950 --> 01:01:32,670
And she's like, good Lord,
juiced up in the car, Bro.

1142
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:36,980
She's getting juiced up in the car and
you can see it like, yeah, really, really?

1143
01:01:37,070 --> 01:01:40,610
I'm like, yeah, I fucking love kissing. I
got her all worked up and then I as I go,

1144
01:01:40,970 --> 01:01:42,140
yeah,
but you know Lee's,

1145
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:45,830
I was brought up a really good
Catholic boy and I was always taught,

1146
01:01:45,831 --> 01:01:47,290
never kiss a girl on the first day,

1147
01:01:47,330 --> 01:01:49,970
get to know her for three or four
dates and then maybe, you know,

1148
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:51,560
kissap just try to bullshit by the way,

1149
01:01:51,561 --> 01:01:55,670
I'll fuck or go on a first date if I can
when anymore because I'm engaged in the

1150
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:59,930
old days. And then her face
just like changed, like, oh,
breath. Really disappointed.

1151
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:01,040
So get to her house,

1152
01:02:01,190 --> 01:02:03,980
she still goes in for a kiss on the lips
and I hated when fucking people do that,

1153
01:02:03,981 --> 01:02:05,330
by the way,
if they're not my girlfriend,

1154
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:07,310
I hate people greeting
me by a kiss on the lips.

1155
01:02:07,670 --> 01:02:09,290
She goes to the a little
library. It's odd, man.

1156
01:02:09,291 --> 01:02:12,080
I got some female friends that do
it and, and I, I don't like it.

1157
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:14,030
She goes to the kiss on the lips.
I turn the cheek,

1158
01:02:14,031 --> 01:02:16,780
she picks the shake out of the
car into the tech from hell.

1159
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:20,700
Right there is an epilogue.
Okay. Date from hell.

1160
01:02:20,701 --> 01:02:22,590
It happened a week out
from Valentine's Day.

1161
01:02:23,190 --> 01:02:27,130
So next weekend comes Valentine's Day
on the Saturday cut to you. Why does

1162
01:02:29,220 --> 01:02:32,730
do,
well if she had away,

1163
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:35,920
you're not too far off because on Sunday,
the night after Valentines,

1164
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:39,780
I got a call from her best friend Wendy
and Wendy is like, hi Michael. It's Wendy.

1165
01:02:40,050 --> 01:02:44,700
Oh my God, you're so romantic. Oh
my God. Am I windy? Cool, thanks.

1166
01:02:44,790 --> 01:02:47,790
Um, why? She goes, oh my God,

1167
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:51,930
the giant teddy bear and the flowers
and the chocolates you send to Elizabeth

1168
01:02:51,931 --> 01:02:56,370
for Valentine's Day. We're so
romantic. I'm like, Huh, what?

1169
01:02:56,730 --> 01:03:00,140
She goes, oh, the chocolates and the and
the teddy bear and the flowers. I got,

1170
01:03:00,141 --> 01:03:01,170
what do you mean Wendy?

1171
01:03:01,710 --> 01:03:06,180
Oh well are in Liz yesterday or last night
and she couldn't talk and she was all

1172
01:03:06,181 --> 01:03:10,170
breathy and panty and said she couldn't
talk to me because she was in bed with

1173
01:03:10,171 --> 01:03:14,550
you. Why fucking lost the
plot? I hang up from windy.

1174
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:18,240
I rang Liz. I'm like, you
fucking based of a woman.

1175
01:03:18,510 --> 01:03:21,330
You're not only was there date
the worst fucking day from hell,

1176
01:03:21,331 --> 01:03:23,640
which is why I didn't ring you.
I guide them.

1177
01:03:23,730 --> 01:03:27,540
I actually felt sorry for you when you're
sick yourselves yourself chocolates

1178
01:03:27,541 --> 01:03:31,050
and a teddy bear and fucking flowers on
Valentine's Day because that's a sad,

1179
01:03:31,051 --> 01:03:33,660
lonely person that does that
and tells all her friends,

1180
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:38,540
but the moment you insinuate I'm fucking
your ugly ass on Valentine's night and

1181
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:40,500
go telling everyone my brother,

1182
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:44,120
this is related directly to
you chasing down there. Dude,

1183
01:03:44,121 --> 01:03:45,870
that knocked on the web
really is all the same.

1184
01:03:45,890 --> 01:03:49,590
It's also creating unnecessary
conflict in your life.

1185
01:03:49,830 --> 01:03:53,460
This poor girl is genetically
fucked by Thor's Hammer.

1186
01:03:55,270 --> 01:03:59,550
You are rubbing salt into the wound
because her sad ass is pretending to be

1187
01:03:59,551 --> 01:04:02,190
fucking, yeah, I was sorry for
when she sent herself the gifts.

1188
01:04:02,191 --> 01:04:05,340
But then you go over the flipping a
gums at your fucking mean. Listen,

1189
01:04:05,710 --> 01:04:10,290
you got delta, a couple of
aces. Some people get to tos.

1190
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:12,600
You know that's just the way life is.
Get this one that.

1191
01:04:12,601 --> 01:04:15,230
I'll tell you another freaky girl
experience from the past chicken. I mean

1192
01:04:17,610 --> 01:04:18,181
you're getting,

1193
01:04:18,181 --> 01:04:21,480
you're getting into this conflict
with his woman the unnecessarily.

1194
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:23,940
This other one. I'm in her life
chasing that guy cause I want,

1195
01:04:23,941 --> 01:04:26,730
I'm going to a club this do
you know, feel, but you don't
feel bad for that beast.

1196
01:04:27,270 --> 01:04:28,710
The NMR the woman.
Yeah.

1197
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:33,210
You don't feel bad for someone who's
just fucked intellectually fucked,

1198
01:04:33,211 --> 01:04:38,211
physically fuck socially knowing pieces
off the fuck socially cause at least

1199
01:04:38,281 --> 01:04:41,670
learn to buy a fucking
bottle of antiperspirant and
stick it under your fucking

1200
01:04:41,671 --> 01:04:45,810
arms. At least learn the decency to
walk to my car with your shoes on.

1201
01:04:45,811 --> 01:04:47,480
Who knows what lighthouse is led,

1202
01:04:47,660 --> 01:04:51,300
you know you're stepping into a life
that's already in progress and who knows

1203
01:04:51,301 --> 01:04:54,850
what the fuck has gone.
She called herself a beach body man,

1204
01:04:54,870 --> 01:04:56,820
unless she has a fucking beached whale.
Like I said,

1205
01:04:56,850 --> 01:05:00,710
last person man to this other
chick shrine, this other don't.

1206
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:02,790
We'd like Catherine Zeta
giants was fucking hot,

1207
01:05:02,850 --> 01:05:05,760
so I met her at a nightclub and
got her details and she goes,

1208
01:05:05,761 --> 01:05:08,210
come over to my house.
So she lives down in Broadmeadows,

1209
01:05:08,250 --> 01:05:11,190
which have someone from
Melbourne's listening board
is the wrong end of town to

1210
01:05:11,191 --> 01:05:13,230
be on. It should have been
a warning sign again for me,

1211
01:05:13,231 --> 01:05:17,100
but it wasn't dry that the broad meadows
sitting there on on a, on a cipher,

1212
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:18,033
her couch,

1213
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:21,280
and we're watching some Johnny Depp
film I'd never seen called cry baby.

1214
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:25,090
It was a five at 58 cocktail talk
to the watch and faggy movies left.

1215
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:29,120
She was hammered when I got there on
fucking Jack Daniels and cokes. Right.

1216
01:05:29,121 --> 01:05:31,900
She was handed by the time I get the
head of it and like two six packs in the

1217
01:05:31,901 --> 01:05:35,940
kitchen was churning through, sitting
there watching this, watching this, this,

1218
01:05:35,970 --> 01:05:38,470
this.
It was a video type actually watching it.

1219
01:05:38,510 --> 01:05:41,590
The first thing I noticed was there's a
little coffee table to the side of the

1220
01:05:41,591 --> 01:05:45,010
couch where I was sitting. There was a
fucking butchers knife, brother. That big,

1221
01:05:45,011 --> 01:05:48,580
just sitting there as a mate there.
Nothing, just a fucking knife that big.

1222
01:05:48,850 --> 01:05:50,250
That sort of freaked me
out. I'm like, all right.

1223
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:53,290
Sitting there watching the movie
and all of a sudden I hear this

1224
01:05:55,780 --> 01:05:59,830
fucking baby crying. I'm like,
the fuck was that? She goes, oh,

1225
01:05:59,831 --> 01:06:03,040
that's my three month old daughter. Just
a moment. I'm going to give her a bottle.

1226
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:06,700
Oh fuck this chick's got a three month
old daughter I didn't know about.

1227
01:06:06,701 --> 01:06:10,060
All right. She goes in the kitchen,
she makes up the baby's formula,

1228
01:06:10,061 --> 01:06:13,180
puts it in the microwave nukes.
It goes back in the baby's room,

1229
01:06:13,510 --> 01:06:16,040
comes back and joins me like 30
seconds later. Impressive plan.

1230
01:06:16,060 --> 01:06:21,060
The video is amazing when you think
about how little a person has to know you

1231
01:06:21,731 --> 01:06:25,840
before you're over their house. Like
you don't even know that she has a baby.

1232
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:30,070
That's how limited your interaction has
been and all of a sudden you're over her

1233
01:06:30,071 --> 01:06:32,200
house. But this is the
thing though. I usually,

1234
01:06:32,260 --> 01:06:34,600
it's my journalistic background
asks so many questions,

1235
01:06:34,601 --> 01:06:37,420
but for some reason she didn't tell
me this and she goes and gives a kid,

1236
01:06:37,421 --> 01:06:42,400
the bottle comes back 30 seconds later.
I'm like, actually gonna feed the kid.

1237
01:06:42,401 --> 01:06:45,580
Then you smack the bottle. Oh yeah,
don't worry if she gets hungry,

1238
01:06:45,581 --> 01:06:49,270
she'll pick up the bottle and feed herself
up. Three month old with a hot bottle.

1239
01:06:49,510 --> 01:06:53,860
Whoa, whoa. I'm like, okay, this chick
is fucking freaked out by this time.

1240
01:06:53,861 --> 01:06:55,120
I'm totally put off her complete.

1241
01:06:55,130 --> 01:06:57,850
Even though she looked like Catherine
Zeta Jones, I'm put off when I'm put off.

1242
01:06:58,150 --> 01:06:59,110
That's it.
I'm put off.

1243
01:06:59,530 --> 01:07:04,030
So the movie ends and she tries to get
a little frisky and I'm less likely not

1244
01:07:04,031 --> 01:07:06,940
real. I've got to go. I gotta work
tomorrow or whatever on the front step.

1245
01:07:06,941 --> 01:07:09,820
And she's like, she's tanked off her nut.
She'd drunk by this stage. She's like,

1246
01:07:10,070 --> 01:07:13,270
no JB with the three month old drunk
with a three month old with a bottle and

1247
01:07:13,271 --> 01:07:15,940
it's cre bright. And she was
like, baby baby don't go yet.

1248
01:07:15,941 --> 01:07:18,060
Let me show you this party trick pro.

1249
01:07:18,061 --> 01:07:21,310
She takes her top off on our front
doorstep. She got this big ass tits,

1250
01:07:21,490 --> 01:07:24,730
grabs a Boob, lifts up to
her mouth, starts licking
your nipple. If Front of me,

1251
01:07:25,710 --> 01:07:28,130
I'm just like,
that's the Worki,

1252
01:07:29,350 --> 01:07:32,460
the whole baby butches knife.
You're drunk Johnny Depp,

1253
01:07:32,750 --> 01:07:34,870
you'd be fucking tip not working.

1254
01:07:35,110 --> 01:07:40,080
I leave her drive home two days later
I'm in a business meeting at like midday

1255
01:07:40,081 --> 01:07:42,070
and she calls.
So I let it go through to voicemail.

1256
01:07:42,340 --> 01:07:45,100
She calls again cause again cause again.
Cause again,

1257
01:07:45,340 --> 01:07:48,160
fun leaves a message for
me prior to the message,

1258
01:07:48,190 --> 01:07:51,490
the next hour after our meeting and
finished the most abusive fucking message

1259
01:07:51,491 --> 01:07:55,810
you've ever heard. You fucking come
to you piece of Shit, mother fucker.

1260
01:07:56,110 --> 01:08:00,190
Every swear word you can imagine, you're
just like every other man. Never call,

1261
01:08:00,191 --> 01:08:03,100
never texted this and that.
Don't pick up the phone when I call you.

1262
01:08:03,101 --> 01:08:06,970
This fucking lost it at me. Yeah.
Wow. That's par for the course.

1263
01:08:07,390 --> 01:08:09,370
That's par for the course
was human beings. Oh Man.

1264
01:08:09,371 --> 01:08:13,760
You know you can say it's checks. It's
cause that's who you're dating suicide.

1265
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:17,420
If you were dating dudes, stories
would be even more pathetic to Ida.

1266
01:08:17,540 --> 01:08:20,480
Chick threatened to slit her wrists
because I want to take her out of your

1267
01:08:20,510 --> 01:08:22,250
fucking savage. Look at
you. That's what it is.

1268
01:08:23,030 --> 01:08:25,670
You know why she can't help herself.
She was a bikini model.

1269
01:08:25,860 --> 01:08:28,880
She thought she was that hot and she was
hot. She texted me photos of herself,

1270
01:08:28,881 --> 01:08:32,800
but I was busy at the time and I'm like,
yeah, maybe I've got to go away overseas.

1271
01:08:32,810 --> 01:08:33,800
Maybe I'll like,
you know,

1272
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:38,150
we'll hook up in three weeks time as she
cracked the shit that she wasn't high

1273
01:08:38,151 --> 01:08:41,120
list of my priorities. Send me all these
pics of her in a bikini. I'm like, yeah,

1274
01:08:41,121 --> 01:08:44,000
that's all pretty big. As
long as if I haven't seen a
fucking models before. Dude,

1275
01:08:44,001 --> 01:08:48,650
like relaxing you stud. Do. She sat
in the Bathtub, import Melbourne,

1276
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:51,590
rang me and threatened to slit her wrists.

1277
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:56,430
I got a think there's more to the story.
My more I just cannot listen to,

1278
01:08:56,590 --> 01:09:00,650
there is no back. Just not
your part. Oh No. My life is
a fucking wreck. Yeah. Yeah.

1279
01:09:00,651 --> 01:09:02,930
You stepped into a bad,
so she fights having a head,

1280
01:09:02,931 --> 01:09:06,380
Schumer just to try and get me to
call her back and then she apologized,

1281
01:09:06,381 --> 01:09:08,450
said none. I wasn't hit him. I was lying.

1282
01:09:08,860 --> 01:09:13,340
The next day she sends me a text message
saying my box hurts her box and box and

1283
01:09:13,341 --> 01:09:14,930
I'm like, what do you mean? She goes,

1284
01:09:14,931 --> 01:09:19,931
my box hertz and then tried to tell me
she had cervical cancer and by this stage

1285
01:09:20,561 --> 01:09:21,050
I'm just like,

1286
01:09:21,050 --> 01:09:24,020
this is really bad because I had people
that have died from cervical cancer.

1287
01:09:24,140 --> 01:09:28,190
I'm like, that's just don't talk stupid
fucking shit to try and get my attention.

1288
01:09:28,220 --> 01:09:30,830
You need a life coach, brother.
Dude, all those days are over.

1289
01:09:30,831 --> 01:09:34,880
This is many moons ago.
Mind you go out chasing derelicts,

1290
01:09:35,660 --> 01:09:37,940
punching your window.
The life coach broke.

1291
01:09:37,941 --> 01:09:40,420
Amazing that something ever in a
situation like they're calling me up.

1292
01:09:40,580 --> 01:09:42,830
I will be up, we'll smoke a joint
together and we'll talk this through.

1293
01:09:42,890 --> 01:09:47,360
It sounds good, man. See,
he's some advice. Crazy. Say
beaches. How it say go. Oh Wow.

1294
01:09:47,361 --> 01:09:50,410
For real tumor. Damn. That's not gonna
stop me for fucking you, isn't it?

1295
01:09:53,030 --> 01:09:55,460
You go good. And he'd come over
and fuck the shit out of her.

1296
01:09:55,461 --> 01:09:57,680
And then she tells you she's wonder
woman. You go, that's awesome.

1297
01:09:58,010 --> 01:09:58,940
I'll call you next week.

1298
01:09:59,030 --> 01:10:03,060
And then you leave so that what you do
is whatever craziness she says, he go,

1299
01:10:03,061 --> 01:10:07,040
oh wow, that's crazy. That's
fucking crazy. I hope you're
okay. Listen, I gotta go.

1300
01:10:07,041 --> 01:10:11,240
I'll call you later and we still got
to fuck. And then she'll say yes,

1301
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:14,300
and then you show up when you fuck that
crazy bitch and that's what you do.

1302
01:10:14,301 --> 01:10:16,460
I'm scared to for crazy bitches.
Then they don't do it.

1303
01:10:16,670 --> 01:10:18,870
But the crazy ones are often the most fun.
Yeah.

1304
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:22,640
Our friend Tony always says it best.
He said that erotic and psychotic,

1305
01:10:22,641 --> 01:10:27,230
our next door neighbors, my, my mic
picked up a crazy chick in a bar.

1306
01:10:27,231 --> 01:10:30,530
I think I told you the story last time
and he gave him Melman finger finger and

1307
01:10:30,590 --> 01:10:32,810
she had the Melvin name.
Oh Mel Meninga. It's,

1308
01:10:32,811 --> 01:10:37,220
and I'm a very famous Australian rugby
player. Melman Mel Meninga Melman.

1309
01:10:37,230 --> 01:10:38,210
So at school we used to say,

1310
01:10:38,211 --> 01:10:40,670
oh I gave this chicken Mel
Meninga three finger mal Meninga.

1311
01:10:40,850 --> 01:10:43,520
So what does that mean?
It means he finger three fingers.

1312
01:10:43,521 --> 01:10:45,590
Why is he have a name for fingering piece?

1313
01:10:45,591 --> 01:10:48,170
Just cause he rides with
finger mal Meninga. Oh,

1314
01:10:49,190 --> 01:10:53,640
so you haven't had a skill at this girl's
story is like finger and other players.

1315
01:10:54,180 --> 01:10:57,470
Melman Nina, the girl and she
had scabbed inside a pussy.

1316
01:10:57,590 --> 01:11:01,970
Well words gabs inside a fucking
pussy. I don't know. It's possible.

1317
01:11:02,330 --> 01:11:06,140
What she'd scratching on the inside that
you feel this gams no, it wasn't me.

1318
01:11:06,141 --> 01:11:09,270
It was my mate. He just like, dude, I
fingered her and the fucking scared up.

1319
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:12,740
They'll hire your friend might be full
of Shit. Now you've done some dirty shit.

1320
01:11:12,860 --> 01:11:16,230
Yeah. Then that's pretty foreign to
have scabs inside your pussy. Yeah.

1321
01:11:16,450 --> 01:11:17,710
If you should scabs and a fucking,

1322
01:11:17,780 --> 01:11:21,000
it was like she likes it'd be playing
a shit if you hit those like wow,

1323
01:11:21,001 --> 01:11:22,860
that was fucking hurt to do.

1324
01:11:22,861 --> 01:11:27,120
You know what you got to find a neat
one day is the willed six games or

1325
01:11:27,121 --> 01:11:30,180
something, right. It was held in like
Japan or something. It's a funny as shit.

1326
01:11:30,181 --> 01:11:35,160
They have a ring like a boxing ring and
they have couples in each corner and one

1327
01:11:35,161 --> 01:11:38,430
of the ones was the guy has to stand
there and look, feel the chicken,

1328
01:11:38,450 --> 01:11:41,730
whichever chick close. The first wins.
There's all these like six games.

1329
01:11:41,890 --> 01:11:45,270
There was another one where
there was like a an alley,

1330
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:48,120
like a long jump sort of alley.
They had measuring parts on it.

1331
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:51,450
The girls would sit there with their
fucking legs spread finger themselves and

1332
01:11:51,451 --> 01:11:53,220
see who could blow the furthest.
It's on the Internet.

1333
01:11:53,220 --> 01:11:56,430
You got to find it somewhere like
world six Olympics or world six games.

1334
01:11:56,431 --> 01:12:01,431
All this crazy fucking Asians fingering
themselves blowing everywhere so you

1335
01:12:01,591 --> 01:12:06,270
could blow the whole squirting thing.
I'd just, that is fucking foul.

1336
01:12:06,780 --> 01:12:11,520
I don't understand the appeal of that.
Even if it's not pissed,

1337
01:12:11,580 --> 01:12:15,970
it's suspect.
I that's 20% piss for sure is,

1338
01:12:16,050 --> 01:12:16,990
I mean it was still there,
right?

1339
01:12:17,020 --> 01:12:19,400
We're actually getting all the fucking
juice from fuck. Is that kind of,

1340
01:12:19,410 --> 01:12:21,300
what is that?
That's salty and it'd be like,

1341
01:12:21,810 --> 01:12:25,740
I don't want to know what it tastes like.
Oh, I don't want to experience it, dude.

1342
01:12:25,741 --> 01:12:29,430
I figured this girl once and I couldn't
get the smell of a bad smelling poon off

1343
01:12:29,431 --> 01:12:33,950
my hands for like a week. Only once,
once that was all to the clean life once,

1344
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:36,620
and I think they'd be spots on my
finger and I'm ringing my make going,

1345
01:12:36,630 --> 01:12:37,910
what the fuck is this chick dancing?

1346
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:40,860
I've got spots on my finger and
I can't get the smell off it.

1347
01:12:40,890 --> 01:12:44,940
I washed and scrubbed that
fucker and just what I had, uh,

1348
01:12:45,210 --> 01:12:48,510
one of my first girlfriends
ever had of stinkbugs disaster.

1349
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:50,920
What are you doing man?
He was a disaster and he fucking eat.

1350
01:12:50,930 --> 01:12:54,350
I had to go with a steep talks.
Tough. But when you're 17, you're a,

1351
01:12:54,351 --> 01:12:57,540
Dick is so hard.
It's this carbon fiber cock.

1352
01:12:58,550 --> 01:13:02,820
Dick just doesn't give a fuck your
Dick as willing to, you could,

1353
01:13:02,970 --> 01:13:06,090
you could have a dead squirrel in your
mouth and your dig would still be hard.

1354
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:06,953
What's worse though,

1355
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:11,640
if a chick has the fucking rotten box or
like an Hungarian Chicago been out with

1356
01:13:11,641 --> 01:13:14,420
ones, has lobbied the luck fucking
curtains. You've got to find out.

1357
01:13:14,421 --> 01:13:16,560
I don't mind that. I like real
the fucking flag, the labs,

1358
01:13:16,561 --> 01:13:20,670
Juicy Pussy Lips and bother me at all.
I don't give a fuck. That feels good.

1359
01:13:20,671 --> 01:13:24,280
That's like a big grippy cause he oh,

lips on and those Polish Gill,

01:13:28,740 --> 01:13:30,420
the looked like Natalie Portman.

1362
01:13:30,421 --> 01:13:32,550
She was fucking hot and she's
known amongst my friends.

1363
01:13:32,551 --> 01:13:36,080
When I tell the story of being bottom
lip Kisa this chick would only keys with

1364
01:13:36,081 --> 01:13:40,820
her bottom lip. Okay. There are
no top lit, no time. Just uh,

1365
01:13:44,470 --> 01:13:48,360
I, I broke up with her because I,
after six weeks of going out with her,

1366
01:13:48,390 --> 01:13:50,830
I'm getting with her leap in the
car cause I'm getting with her,

1367
01:13:50,831 --> 01:13:53,680
I'm getting with their lip with passion
and the Cup passions in Australian word

1368
01:13:53,681 --> 01:13:56,750
for Kesha. Did you ask her to kiss
with the upper lip as well? As I said,

1369
01:13:57,480 --> 01:13:59,990
at least two. I'm going to think that
weird lizards. I'm like these one.

1370
01:13:59,991 --> 01:14:03,210
Have you ever kissed like the top
lippy Tanga as she just was like,

1371
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:06,030
well this is the way our kiss.
If you don't like it then don't kiss me.

1372
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:08,130
And she was fucking hot and I'm
like, Oh fuck. Okay Sir. Anyway,

1373
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:11,910
but she wasn't put a chicken check
when they talk like that or not.

1374
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:14,260
She was the moment the girl said
something like that and go, listen,

1375
01:14:14,890 --> 01:14:17,560
you seem like you're in a bad mood.
Somebody send you home,

1376
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:20,470
can you take care and I'll call you later.
So He'd wherever you go,

1377
01:14:20,471 --> 01:14:22,990
my shoulder when he could meet me,
cause that's the reason I dumped her.

1378
01:14:22,991 --> 01:14:24,970
Eventually after six weeks
were making out in the car,

1379
01:14:25,150 --> 01:14:29,800
I lean over to put a hand on a tip
on top of her clients. You suck. No,

1380
01:14:30,130 --> 01:14:33,900
I want it to be special. The fuck.
After six weeks I can't even get it.

1381
01:14:33,901 --> 01:14:36,820
Fucking tits. This is all shit that I
happened to me when I was in high school.

1382
01:14:36,940 --> 01:14:39,850
It's true about Australia.
Like you guys like catch on late.

1383
01:14:39,910 --> 01:14:42,490
Like things happen later for you.
How's the light blue man?

1384
01:14:42,491 --> 01:14:44,590
I was the biggest fucking
nerd when I was young.

1385
01:14:44,591 --> 01:14:49,240
It took me get your first slice
of Pie. Fuck man. My first,

1386
01:14:49,270 --> 01:14:51,430
you know what my first kiss was at 16?

1387
01:14:51,730 --> 01:14:56,730
My first slice of Pie was not until like
21 tap damn with a French maritian girl

1388
01:14:56,771 --> 01:15:01,420
that I was dating who was like there at
times marine French murder. It's like,

1389
01:15:01,430 --> 01:15:05,830
Whoa, this French maritian girl named
Anik qls hot too. Yeah. But uh, man,

1390
01:15:05,831 --> 01:15:09,070
I was a late bloomer, but I might
approach it in due time. Listen man,

1391
01:15:09,071 --> 01:15:12,220
you're always gonna run into weird
people if you're trying to date because

1392
01:15:12,221 --> 01:15:15,400
you're going to go and run into weird
people just randomly try to make friends.

1393
01:15:15,730 --> 01:15:15,941
You know,

1394
01:15:15,941 --> 01:15:19,720
the problem is people are so horny that
they're not that particular about who

1395
01:15:19,721 --> 01:15:20,920
they stick their penis and inside.

1396
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:23,990
That's why you wind up with so many
fucked up situation. So you have,

1397
01:15:24,030 --> 01:15:26,170
the thing that shoots me,
and maybe you can relate to this as well,

1398
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:30,580
is that ice when I stood date chicks
and the got the chicks knows like chicks

1399
01:15:30,581 --> 01:15:32,290
that I used to like they
didn't like me back then,

1400
01:15:32,580 --> 01:15:36,070
but recently because my profile's gone up,
you know,

1401
01:15:36,071 --> 01:15:39,040
working on TV and people are
seeing my face on TV and stuff.

1402
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:41,410
Those chicks like send you
a message out of nowhere,

1403
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:44,230
find you on Facebook or find
you on Twitter or you know,

1404
01:15:44,231 --> 01:15:46,810
they suddenly have your number back in
their phone. They're like texting you.

1405
01:15:47,020 --> 01:15:50,860
Yeah, let's go out how you're doing. Been
thinking about, it's like the fuck man.

1406
01:15:50,861 --> 01:15:54,540
Only because you've seen me
on TV or something. You can
fucking squirming visit,

1407
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:56,330
take advantage of that and
just stuff you're cocking

1408
01:15:59,290 --> 01:16:03,990
sounds to me like the throngs of
Pussy near all indignant about it. Uh,

1409
01:16:04,090 --> 01:16:05,610
at least to be very selective about my,

1410
01:16:06,050 --> 01:16:08,650
my pussy selections may need a life coach.
I'm telling you,

1411
01:16:08,710 --> 01:16:10,870
I can help you to do I ever
tell you that in my service.

1412
01:16:10,871 --> 01:16:13,450
I have to tell you what happened in
Vegas the first time I went there at rate

1413
01:16:13,690 --> 01:16:15,280
actually racist or doesn't
even know this story.

1414
01:16:15,281 --> 01:16:18,550
I can't believe I'm about to tell it now.
Freight listens. He'll kill me. Dante,

1415
01:16:19,030 --> 01:16:21,850
I'll tell it. Fuck it. Throw Ray under
the bus. No, right? Wasn't there.

1416
01:16:22,050 --> 01:16:26,110
It was all using Ray's house. Oh, I
was in Vegas for the first time ever.

1417
01:16:26,140 --> 01:16:29,200
This is like going back
in 2006 or 2007 for k one.

1418
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:33,190
And after the show we'd say to Bellagio
for k one and I stayed at res for a few

1419
01:16:33,190 --> 01:16:34,420
nights,
but he was going to Japan.

1420
01:16:34,421 --> 01:16:37,990
So I had a whole house to
myself and I met this girl at a,

1421
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:41,850
at Caesars beautiful black girl, man.
She looked a bit like Janet Jackson Ish,

1422
01:16:41,851 --> 01:16:42,910
sort of really hot.

1423
01:16:43,330 --> 01:16:47,050
And I had a number and I thought I'll
give her a call and see what she's doing.

1424
01:16:47,350 --> 01:16:50,630
Right. Had a big fucking house in Vegas
with a Jacuzzi out there. And I'm like,

1425
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:54,100
hey, this will be impressive. So I've
written this girl and she's like, oh yeah,

1426
01:16:54,101 --> 01:16:54,970
cool.
I'm not doing anything.

1427
01:16:54,971 --> 01:16:57,520
I'll come over with my cousin is that I
came and I'm like, sweet, come on over.

1428
01:16:57,680 --> 01:17:01,480
Got a whole house fridge, stocked of
alcohol, fucking a fridge full of food.

1429
01:17:01,810 --> 01:17:02,643
Come on over.

1430
01:17:02,740 --> 01:17:05,980
So she comes over with a
cousin and a cousins crack
and hot as well. I'm like, oh,

1431
01:17:05,981 --> 01:17:10,520
this is too good to be true. And
she goes to me, um, do you smoke?

1432
01:17:10,860 --> 01:17:13,280
I'm like, no, no, not
really. And she goes,

1433
01:17:13,281 --> 01:17:16,950
do you want to have like a puff in the
Jacuzzi? Oh fuck it. Which was like,

1434
01:17:16,980 --> 01:17:20,300
we'd just talking about weed. Weed,
right. I got, okay, cool. She goes,

1435
01:17:20,301 --> 01:17:24,710
do you smoke blunt? And I know what's
going no. Then on what plenty is,

1436
01:17:25,130 --> 01:17:26,690
I know what's planted.
Is it like marijuana?

1437
01:17:26,691 --> 01:17:29,180
She started describing the
fucking process, whatever to me,

1438
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:33,260
but she got like a cigar that was at that
big and somehow slice it with a razor

1439
01:17:33,261 --> 01:17:37,160
blade and hollowed it out and stuffed all
this blunting there. So we're going to,

1440
01:17:37,161 --> 01:17:40,280
the word it is, is, is two
different ways. Okay. In England.

1441
01:17:40,340 --> 01:17:43,940
A lot of times they'll leave enrolled
their joints with a tobacco in it.

1442
01:17:44,210 --> 01:17:47,110
They'll roll like cigarette tobacco
and somebody's doing in Australia too.

1443
01:17:47,111 --> 01:17:50,300
They do that to make it burn longer.
They'll burn out. Don't do that.

1444
01:17:50,301 --> 01:17:53,270
It's terrible for you and it ruins the
whole thing. And then the other ways,

1445
01:17:53,271 --> 01:17:56,390
the blunt, there's two ways of doing
that. Sometimes with tobacco inside of it,

1446
01:17:56,391 --> 01:17:59,090
but most of the time not,
but using the tobacco leaf,

1447
01:17:59,270 --> 01:18:02,990
which is the cigar case,
you know,

1448
01:18:03,050 --> 01:18:07,760
the different students of Gars and joints
or cigarettes is that if you smoke a

1449
01:18:07,761 --> 01:18:12,200
cigar, the you are actually, there's
a, an actual leaf that's covering it.

1450
01:18:12,201 --> 01:18:15,800
The whole thing that you're smoking
is pure plant manner, you know,

1451
01:18:15,801 --> 01:18:20,030
and a good cigar. Especially like their
prized for their leaf and the rapper,

1452
01:18:20,180 --> 01:18:23,900
you know, it's a special plant that they
grow just particularly for that purpose.

1453
01:18:24,140 --> 01:18:28,400
Well, you know, when you inhale it
though, you don't inhale a cigar.

1454
01:18:28,580 --> 01:18:32,300
When you smoke a cigar, you take a
breath, you keep it in your mouth,

1455
01:18:32,301 --> 01:18:36,050
in any blow it out and you taste and
you get a buzz from the nicotine,

1456
01:18:36,290 --> 01:18:39,310
but you inhale weed.
So when they roll these blondes,

1457
01:18:39,390 --> 01:18:42,890
their inhaler and this
deep heavy tobacco plump,

1458
01:18:42,940 --> 01:18:46,290
the type of weight or just the way
you roll away roll is a type of way.

1459
01:18:46,300 --> 01:18:50,200
No nightgowns away. Rolling. Okay.
Gotcha. So she, well she called us,

1460
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:53,140
she rolled a blunt.
She printed this God backhoe.

1461
01:18:53,930 --> 01:18:57,050
It's tobacco and weed together because
of the tobacco leaf is going on.

1462
01:18:57,051 --> 01:18:59,360
She puts in this big ass Nigga.
We got to the Jacuzzi. I'm like,

1463
01:18:59,361 --> 01:19:02,720
this is fucking mad is too hot.
Chicks either side of me in the Jacuzzi.

1464
01:19:02,721 --> 01:19:06,330
It's like nine o'clock
paper getting it.

1465
01:19:07,970 --> 01:19:11,000
I'll take two puffs on this
thing and dude, I'm fucked. My,

1466
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:14,000
my mind felt like it was just
floating over there and I'm like,

1467
01:19:14,001 --> 01:19:17,180
this is fucked me up. I'm
going to get back inside.
Came back and saw him walking.

1468
01:19:17,181 --> 01:19:21,530
I can feel my body walking, but my
mind's wandering off until another realm.

1469
01:19:21,530 --> 01:19:25,370
You know, I plunked down on Ray's big
chair and then the girls come in like,

1470
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:28,690
you know, 25 minutes later and
they're drying off and I'm,

1471
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:32,890
the cousin starts to sit on my lap
and mess around and going to be sign

1472
01:19:33,140 --> 01:19:36,230
aggressive cousin and then the other
girls is helping us sell in the fridge,

1473
01:19:36,250 --> 01:19:39,350
eating, having some drinks, whatever.
Cousins are loving me on this. Just cool.

1474
01:19:39,380 --> 01:19:42,440
Still off my fucking brain. She goes,
don't you want to go upstairs? I'm like,

1475
01:19:42,530 --> 01:19:45,290
sweet. So then you're upstairs.
The other one robs you.

1476
01:19:45,710 --> 01:19:49,970
Rob's Ray's house upstairs into rise
bedroom and raised beds was like fucking,

1477
01:19:50,030 --> 01:19:52,360
he had this bed with posts
like a jungle fucking bagels.

1478
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:57,080
Really pimp his wardrobe was the
size of this room. Fucking huge.

1479
01:19:57,470 --> 01:20:00,650
So lying down on the bed,
getting naked, you know, blah,

1480
01:20:00,651 --> 01:20:03,770
blah blah or mucking around. It'd be, it
erases. Got One of his world title belts,

1481
01:20:04,070 --> 01:20:07,510
neither Baden, right? She was
like, do you like being spanked? My

1482
01:20:08,370 --> 01:20:11,710
hello, whatever you want to sell. Phones,
world title bounce. She gets the right.

1483
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:14,700
His world title bout turns me over
and started whacking me on the arch.

1484
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:18,880
We these world title it's in, there's
kickboxing world title belts, the speeds.

1485
01:20:18,881 --> 01:20:22,290
A fucking heavy man. Whoa
again, you need your life coat.

1486
01:20:23,170 --> 01:20:23,920
He called me up here.

1487
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:28,920
John met Ray Sefo with the
world's heavyweight champion.

1488
01:20:29,650 --> 01:20:33,810
This bitch wants to hit me with his
belt. What do I do? You say no, the fuck

1489
01:20:35,990 --> 01:20:36,860
I turn back over.

1490
01:20:38,270 --> 01:20:42,360
That's when it fucking or by now and
she's [inaudible]. She's talking too much.

1491
01:20:42,390 --> 01:20:46,290
She goes, me, baby. If he got what I need,
I'm like, oh yeah, it's in the bathroom.

1492
01:20:46,291 --> 01:20:49,140
Just go get a condom and I'm told
toiletries bag in the bathroom and cool.

1493
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:51,240
She goes, no baby. If he got what I need

1494
01:20:52,740 --> 01:20:55,350
to fucking rubbers in the bathroom,
go grab one radio.

1495
01:20:55,410 --> 01:20:59,520
Fucking what you need right here.
These cocaine. She goes, no, baby.

1496
01:20:59,940 --> 01:21:04,940
You see my car's in the pound and it's
going to cost $400 to get it out and I'm

1497
01:21:06,211 --> 01:21:11,100
really strapped for cash too. I sobered
up in a hurry. I'm like, Oh fuck.

1498
01:21:11,330 --> 01:21:14,610
I go, you fucking hooker.
Oh baby, don't be like that.

1499
01:21:14,611 --> 01:21:18,060
I just need the money for my car and
I'm like, are you a fucking hooker?

1500
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:21,390
And she like admitted to it. I fucking
grabbed her, threw her off. Me.

1501
01:21:21,450 --> 01:21:25,160
How many girls rock the hooker
world that way? Ran Downstairs.

1502
01:21:25,170 --> 01:21:27,870
Cause then that picture of a mom
thing to someone's me at Ray's house,

1503
01:21:27,871 --> 01:21:31,470
Rez got all this fucking cool shit and
chooses sitting on the sofa reading,

1504
01:21:31,471 --> 01:21:34,560
fucking eating and drinking a grabbed her,
grabbed her cousin,

1505
01:21:34,710 --> 01:21:37,530
threw them out the fucking front door.
Should have went with the cousin,

1506
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:42,710
the cousin and she's the
one if 160 bucks later man.

1507
01:21:42,750 --> 01:21:45,750
So do you think that that's how the,
she rocks it all the time.

1508
01:21:45,751 --> 01:21:48,780
She shows up a guy's houses and just ask
them for money when she gets him horny?

1509
01:21:49,050 --> 01:21:49,650
I think so.

1510
01:21:49,650 --> 01:21:53,760
Cause I was ready to go and then at where
to get killed is going to get killed.

1511
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:58,470
I all's ropable man. I grabbed
her, grabbed the girlfriend again,

1512
01:21:58,500 --> 01:22:03,480
think about how quickly you get intimate
with someone that you don't even know

1513
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:06,030
how crazy that is. You
know? I mean, it's like,

1514
01:22:06,210 --> 01:22:10,500
that's the weirdest thing about dating
is how quickly people are willing to get

1515
01:22:10,501 --> 01:22:12,240
intimate with complete total strangers.

1516
01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:15,120
And The lady with the three month
old baby lets you in the house,

1517
01:22:15,121 --> 01:22:18,450
you don't even know this fucking brought
out a baby and you're already alone

1518
01:22:18,451 --> 01:22:22,710
with her and she's looking at her tits,
you know, it's like with a knife. Yeah.

1519
01:22:22,710 --> 01:22:26,790
If you had to make friends
the way you try to get laid,

1520
01:22:26,791 --> 01:22:28,170
like if it was like really important,

1521
01:22:28,410 --> 01:22:31,650
like you needed a friend every couple
of days, you know, I mean, Jesus Christ,

1522
01:22:31,810 --> 01:22:33,900
your friendships would be fucking chaotic.

1523
01:22:33,901 --> 01:22:37,860
They'd be crazy if we needed
friendship as much as we need sex,

1524
01:22:38,070 --> 01:22:42,000
which by the ways it's real possible.
You know? Has he ever dumped a friend?

1525
01:22:42,001 --> 01:22:45,930
Like you would dump a girlfriend? Yes.
You have done a friend dump of a guy,

1526
01:22:45,931 --> 01:22:49,020
not a million times of a dude.
Yup. Yeah. What did you say to him?

1527
01:22:49,260 --> 01:22:52,500
Can I hang out with you anymore?
Just negative. Straight off. Yeah.

1528
01:22:52,501 --> 01:22:54,930
There's some dudes that you will,
uh,

1529
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:56,730
you will have good times
with in the beginning,

1530
01:22:56,731 --> 01:22:59,620
but then somewhere along the line, as
you get to know them better, their,

1531
01:22:59,630 --> 01:23:01,800
their character flaws are exposed,
exposed,

1532
01:23:01,801 --> 01:23:03,390
and they're not willing
to be honest about it.

1533
01:23:03,510 --> 01:23:06,310
So then every time you're hanging
with that person, it becomes

1534
01:23:06,310 --> 01:23:09,010
a problem becomes all around that person.

1535
01:23:09,130 --> 01:23:11,800
It becomes this person's character to
flow that everybody has to like sort of

1536
01:23:11,801 --> 01:23:16,120
deal with, whether it's jealousy or
whether it's being overly aggressive,

1537
01:23:16,121 --> 01:23:19,900
whether it's being dicky to
women, you know, do whatever
the fuck it is. You know,

1538
01:23:19,901 --> 01:23:20,171
there's,

1539
01:23:20,171 --> 01:23:23,350
there's certain dudes that are not
willing to look at reality and then not

1540
01:23:23,351 --> 01:23:24,340
willing to evolve.

1541
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:28,090
And the real problem is if you surround
yourself with someone like that,

1542
01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:33,120
that all your evolution stops as well
as there's all your progress as a human

1543
01:23:34,151 --> 01:23:37,120
being stops, as does theirs.
So when you're out with them,

1544
01:23:37,121 --> 01:23:40,630
that if they're enacting
conti and Douchey, you're,
you're locked into this conti,

1545
01:23:40,631 --> 01:23:43,060
douchey life. You know, this
is, this is your, your crew.

1546
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:44,410
This is who you're hanging out with,
man.

1547
01:23:44,770 --> 01:23:47,260
And if you don't surround
yourself with likeminded people,

1548
01:23:47,261 --> 01:23:48,610
you don't grow together.

1549
01:23:48,820 --> 01:23:52,240
So when you're with someone that you
feel like is a roadblock to your own

1550
01:23:52,241 --> 01:23:53,260
personal enlightenment,

1551
01:23:53,261 --> 01:23:55,450
it's important for you to separate
yourself from that person.

1552
01:23:55,540 --> 01:23:58,290
We have a heat from this guy again.
And when you did the Oakwood,

1553
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:01,600
Guilford has been a full time. It was
a few different guys, not just one man,

1554
01:24:01,740 --> 01:24:05,580
a bunch of different guys over the years,
you know, just people just, um, you know,

1555
01:24:05,610 --> 01:24:09,760
and I'm, look, I'm a very good
and loyal friend and um, I,

1556
01:24:09,860 --> 01:24:11,450
I pride myself on,

1557
01:24:11,451 --> 01:24:15,260
on keeping good and loyal
friends and you know, and,

1558
01:24:15,261 --> 01:24:16,780
and making them appreciate,

1559
01:24:17,230 --> 01:24:20,200
making them realize how much I appreciate
them and making them, you know,

1560
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:23,560
I think friendships are one of the most
important things you could foster in

1561
01:24:23,561 --> 01:24:25,030
this world. You know, to develop,

1562
01:24:25,270 --> 01:24:28,390
to be able to hook up with
people that are interested.

1563
01:24:28,391 --> 01:24:32,110
Like the one of the most beautiful things
about this podcast has been the fact

1564
01:24:32,111 --> 01:24:35,860
that I've exposed a lot of people to the
friends that have cultivated my friend

1565
01:24:35,861 --> 01:24:39,370
Brian Cowen and Duncan and all these
really brilliant people that I know that

1566
01:24:39,371 --> 01:24:41,400
are really interesting
cats and I mean that's my,

1567
01:24:41,401 --> 01:24:44,860
my proudest achievement in
life is surrounding myself
with an interesting group

1568
01:24:44,861 --> 01:24:49,020
of friends. And I shouldn't say
proudest but most most satisfying. Yeah.

1569
01:24:49,660 --> 01:24:52,720
Wow. This is amazing. I have such, I'm
so lucky to have such cool friends.

1570
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:55,720
The only way you can
have that is if you call,

1571
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:59,290
you have to get rid of ones that don't
keep up cause that not everybody keeps up.

1572
01:24:59,291 --> 01:25:02,890
Just like not every girl,
like you have this great girl in Irene,

1573
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:05,290
but look how many comments you
had to go through to get to her.

1574
01:25:05,590 --> 01:25:08,830
Well that's just the way it
is with friends as well. It's
the same thing. You, you,

1575
01:25:08,890 --> 01:25:11,680
you, you will appreciate people
that have their shit together.

1576
01:25:11,681 --> 01:25:14,530
When you deal with enough
people that don't, and there
are certain point in time,

1577
01:25:14,531 --> 01:25:18,280
some people are just not willing to
take personal responsibility and grow.

1578
01:25:18,490 --> 01:25:20,590
And when you run into those people,
you got to,

1579
01:25:20,980 --> 01:25:24,640
you got to separate from them because
their roadblocks, they become problems.

1580
01:25:24,641 --> 01:25:25,010
There's,

1581
01:25:25,010 --> 01:25:28,900
there's no growing and it all becomes
dealing with them and their issues.

1582
01:25:29,180 --> 01:25:30,410
And as you get older,
you realize,

1583
01:25:30,411 --> 01:25:33,320
don't you see how many friends you had
when you were young? And as you get old,

1584
01:25:33,330 --> 01:25:35,660
you call it and call it and call it.
And Dude,

1585
01:25:35,661 --> 01:25:39,350
I've got like five friends that I keep
really close like my inner circle,

1586
01:25:39,540 --> 01:25:44,120
but no shit about me than everyone else
is a big fucking perimeter around that

1587
01:25:44,121 --> 01:25:46,460
inner circle. You know, it's an sorry,

1588
01:25:46,461 --> 01:25:49,550
but the more you travel as well and you're
away from home and a wife from those

1589
01:25:49,551 --> 01:25:49,851
friends,

1590
01:25:49,851 --> 01:25:53,450
you realize how much you love them and
how much you do need them in your life.

1591
01:25:53,490 --> 01:25:56,600
Yeah. And close to you and giving that
love too in that positive energy to you.

1592
01:25:56,780 --> 01:25:59,230
So that you can survive in
your own life. Yeah. Yeah.

1593
01:25:59,580 --> 01:26:04,040
You grow together. You know, we human
beings if like I always of of of,

1594
01:26:04,130 --> 01:26:04,801
you know my,

1595
01:26:04,801 --> 01:26:08,940
my closest friends that like my friend
Brian Callan is a perfect example.

1596
01:26:08,941 --> 01:26:13,490
Like if Brian consider something and he
brings it to me and tells me about it,

1597
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:17,600
I know that it's going to be well thought
out and I know that I can consider it

1598
01:26:17,870 --> 01:26:21,920
almost as,
as if it's my own thoughts.

1599
01:26:22,130 --> 01:26:25,790
Like I can appreciate his experiences and
his interpretations of his experiences

1600
01:26:25,940 --> 01:26:27,530
so much I can,

1601
01:26:27,680 --> 01:26:30,950
I can trust in them so much that I trusted
them almost as much as I would trust

1602
01:26:30,951 --> 01:26:34,400
in my own because of the genuine friends
that you know have no personal agenda

1603
01:26:34,401 --> 01:26:37,940
that we have crossed that give you what
I recommend is going to be solely for

1604
01:26:37,941 --> 01:26:42,560
your own benefit and nothing to gain
from it. Solely honest. Yeah, exactly.

1605
01:26:42,590 --> 01:26:45,140
Cause there's folks that you talk to
where you, you don't get that man.

1606
01:26:45,141 --> 01:26:46,490
You don't get the honesty.

1607
01:26:46,700 --> 01:26:51,380
You get this weird amalgamation of the
truth and fiction because they don't want

1608
01:26:51,381 --> 01:26:54,800
to come off looking like a loser or they
don't want to come off looking like an

1609
01:26:54,820 --> 01:26:57,320
asshole when in fact maybe you know,

1610
01:26:57,350 --> 01:27:00,890
some more shit was their fault and you're
not getting the full version of it and

1611
01:27:00,891 --> 01:27:02,540
they want you to back them
up. You know, if you're,

1612
01:27:02,550 --> 01:27:05,330
my friend did back me up like no,
if I was your friend,

1613
01:27:05,331 --> 01:27:06,890
I would tell you when
you're being a Douche bag,

1614
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:10,700
you know that idea that you know, a
friend has to only be positive, you know,

1615
01:27:10,701 --> 01:27:13,780
all the time when you're being negative,
they can't be honest about it. Yeah,

1616
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:18,410
it's a, it's a real problem that people
have fostering good friendships and good

1617
01:27:18,411 --> 01:27:19,880
relationships.
And you know,

1618
01:27:19,881 --> 01:27:23,420
that's one of the happiest things that
I've been able to do with this podcast.

1619
01:27:23,421 --> 01:27:26,060
I've talked to so many people
that we've met, you know,

1620
01:27:26,061 --> 01:27:30,080
all over the country that don't have
people that are thinking like this around

1621
01:27:30,081 --> 01:27:30,440
them.

1622
01:27:30,440 --> 01:27:34,820
So they're not exposed to a lot of the
stuff that we're talking about in their

1623
01:27:34,821 --> 01:27:38,240
neighborhood or their community. And their
and their circle, their social circle,

1624
01:27:38,660 --> 01:27:41,870
you know, and you got to find people
like this, you gotta, you gotta,

1625
01:27:41,871 --> 01:27:45,290
you gotta find people that you can
trust and that and hang out with because

1626
01:27:45,291 --> 01:27:46,730
they're out there,
they're out there.

1627
01:27:47,100 --> 01:27:50,180
You could have a bunch of negative
conference and just think that all your

1628
01:27:50,181 --> 01:27:52,460
friends and all the people that you
ever going to meet or negative comments,

1629
01:27:52,580 --> 01:27:56,360
and then all of a sudden you'll
just find some oasis of Nice people.

1630
01:27:56,510 --> 01:27:58,970
And if you're not a negative
con and those people like you,

1631
01:27:59,060 --> 01:28:01,130
then all of a sudden your life
in measurably gets better.

1632
01:28:01,610 --> 01:28:04,190
If your friendships are good,
your life is a measurably better.

1633
01:28:04,460 --> 01:28:08,330
That's why I always tell people in
bad relationships and bad friendships,

1634
01:28:08,540 --> 01:28:11,780
just fucking get out.
If you're confident that it's not you,

1635
01:28:11,930 --> 01:28:14,660
if you're a nice person,
if you then just get out.

1636
01:28:14,720 --> 01:28:17,510
Did I seen some people stick around
in marriages or relationships,

1637
01:28:17,511 --> 01:28:21,620
which fucking abuse? Yelling matches
every night. You know how it's like,

1638
01:28:21,621 --> 01:28:23,330
how the fuck do you stay there?

1639
01:28:23,510 --> 01:28:26,140
And there's some people that would tell
you if you don't yell, you don't love it.

1640
01:28:26,340 --> 01:28:29,420
It's hilarious. It's motion, man.
I've never yelled at Irene. You know,

1641
01:28:29,421 --> 01:28:31,940
we've never had a yelling match.
We might have disagreements,

1642
01:28:31,941 --> 01:28:35,870
but they fucking over in 30 seconds and
then I get nasty. No yelling matches.

1643
01:28:36,110 --> 01:28:38,480
Just like, why would you
yelling matches usually come.

1644
01:28:38,510 --> 01:28:42,950
I think in relationships with someone
is trying to point score under a partner

1645
01:28:43,130 --> 01:28:46,580
and get the upper hand and always
think to myself, if you love someone,

1646
01:28:46,730 --> 01:28:49,490
why the fuck would want to try and
point score on them? You know? It's all,

1647
01:28:49,491 --> 01:28:51,500
it's all in how you getting raised?
I think a lot of it,

1648
01:28:51,501 --> 01:28:53,360
a lot of it is people
growing up with horrible,

1649
01:28:53,361 --> 01:28:56,990
horrible relationships and sometimes
people grow up in horrible relationships

1650
01:28:56,991 --> 01:28:59,960
and it actually makes them better at
relationships because they realize,

1651
01:28:59,961 --> 01:29:02,280
well fuck, I don't want to be like
my mom and dad. Yeah. You know,

1652
01:29:02,281 --> 01:29:04,920
I'm not into fighting. So you
know, I've met girls that they,

1653
01:29:04,921 --> 01:29:06,330
their parents fought like crazy,

1654
01:29:06,331 --> 01:29:10,470
so they were like really cool and calm
because it seems so much stupid shit.

1655
01:29:10,740 --> 01:29:12,840
And Men the same way.
It's like, you know, the,

1656
01:29:12,841 --> 01:29:17,841
the real reality of relationships is the
idea of finding one's human being and

1657
01:29:18,961 --> 01:29:23,961
you've lived 30 plus years of programming
and changing your personality and

1658
01:29:24,901 --> 01:29:26,300
molding to your environment and,

1659
01:29:26,301 --> 01:29:29,250
and adapting to all the shit
that you see in your world.

1660
01:29:29,340 --> 01:29:33,780
And then add a known where you introduce
some new player and you've got to

1661
01:29:33,781 --> 01:29:36,690
decipher like the
fucking Dead Sea Scrolls.

1662
01:29:36,690 --> 01:29:41,130
So you've got to go back and figure out
where all this comes from, where's this,

1663
01:29:41,220 --> 01:29:43,710
where's this attitude?
Why is that attitude of why?

1664
01:29:43,860 --> 01:29:47,010
Why does she get indignant when
I don't know, open her car door.

1665
01:29:47,170 --> 01:29:49,950
Like when is the root of this?
And you know,

1666
01:29:50,310 --> 01:29:53,540
how much did she really believe in
this God thing? You know? And then you,

1667
01:29:53,570 --> 01:29:57,930
you know, like you said, meeting that
person, you think to yourself, okay,

1668
01:29:58,080 --> 01:29:59,640
there's 6 billion people in the world.

1669
01:29:59,641 --> 01:30:02,790
Let's call for three and a half billion
of them women and you're trying to make

1670
01:30:02,791 --> 01:30:05,350
this one and you're trying to meet
this one. Pretty much. We came,

1671
01:30:05,580 --> 01:30:08,350
what a 20 kilometer radius of your house.
Do you know,

1672
01:30:08,351 --> 01:30:10,650
trying to meet her into state or
another city around the kilometers.

1673
01:30:10,651 --> 01:30:13,110
What does that in miles have no lifting.

1674
01:30:13,170 --> 01:30:16,150
Let's have a cool 20 miles of your house,
30 miles of your house,

1675
01:30:16,750 --> 01:30:20,610
and your ratio of where you go out to
your perimeter circumference where you hit

1676
01:30:20,611 --> 01:30:25,020
out too much. You know, you'd have to
get too much pussy quotes. Exactly.

1677
01:30:25,021 --> 01:30:29,370
And that's a minuscule, like the betting
odds on that must be insane of funny.

1678
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:33,270
That person are you getting in Los
Angeles? There's so many fucking people,

1679
01:30:33,420 --> 01:30:35,010
you know, it's not going
to be the perfect. I mean,

1680
01:30:35,170 --> 01:30:37,190
you know what is the perfect
poppet person, you know,

1681
01:30:37,191 --> 01:30:39,720
and it's like everybody's got their own
different version of what the fuck that

1682
01:30:39,721 --> 01:30:43,830
is. But the reality with most people
is they don't like themselves,

1683
01:30:43,831 --> 01:30:46,470
so they're going to be a shitty
relationship no matter what.

1684
01:30:46,650 --> 01:30:48,360
No matter who they get hooked up with,

1685
01:30:48,390 --> 01:30:51,580
they're going to be self
defeating and self sabotaging.

1686
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:54,840
That's the majority of people,
especially people struggling,

1687
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:57,750
especially people that
aren't happy with their,

1688
01:30:57,870 --> 01:31:01,500
their art or their career or their chosen
profession or whatever the fuck it is.

1689
01:31:01,501 --> 01:31:04,650
They're pursuing and they're in some
state of turmoil where they're trying to

1690
01:31:04,651 --> 01:31:05,790
accomplish some things.

1691
01:31:06,170 --> 01:31:09,000
A lot of people out there unhappy with
themselves man and they're not going to

1692
01:31:09,001 --> 01:31:11,460
be happy no matter who the fuck
they're with. They're going to,

1693
01:31:11,610 --> 01:31:15,090
they're going to get comfortable with
anybody and start being dicky with them

1694
01:31:15,091 --> 01:31:16,440
cause they're dicky with themselves.

1695
01:31:16,441 --> 01:31:18,810
And like you said that the pip you don't
want to pay around cause a negative

1696
01:31:18,811 --> 01:31:21,750
energy is just fucking intense man.
You know,

1697
01:31:21,751 --> 01:31:25,650
he was saying before about the friends
and how you'll close friend friends

1698
01:31:25,651 --> 01:31:28,190
sometimes therefore to like
similar to your thoughts. Yes.

1699
01:31:28,310 --> 01:31:32,680
Do you believe in stuff like um, if
you have a research Ed Casey, you know,

1700
01:31:32,790 --> 01:31:36,960
who could apparently medically treat
people by apparently be able to tap into

1701
01:31:36,961 --> 01:31:41,460
the worldwide consciousness of everyone
and pluck any information he needed from

1702
01:31:41,461 --> 01:31:45,180
any mind in the world to be able to dog
knows someone I haven't heard pro and

1703
01:31:45,181 --> 01:31:46,680
con for Edgar Casey,

1704
01:31:47,010 --> 01:31:51,680
my friend Eddie is a big proponent of
Edgar Casey but he's also big into Ufos.

1705
01:31:52,200 --> 01:31:53,880
He loves sexy things.

1706
01:31:53,881 --> 01:31:58,470
He loves ghosts and spirits and
channelers and he loves all that stuff.

1707
01:31:58,710 --> 01:32:02,440
Me, I am a, um, I'm a cautious optimist.

1708
01:32:02,680 --> 01:32:03,840
And so I think it's,

1709
01:32:03,841 --> 01:32:07,210
it's interesting to me that there could
be a possibility of some person who has

1710
01:32:07,211 --> 01:32:10,810
some incredible extra sensory perception
to the point where they can read your

1711
01:32:10,811 --> 01:32:13,450
future or your past or
find out things about you.

1712
01:32:13,451 --> 01:32:16,420
But I'm now convinced I'm not convinced,

1713
01:32:16,421 --> 01:32:20,620
and I'm also not convinced that people
are being objective about their accounts

1714
01:32:20,621 --> 01:32:24,400
because I know like many other things,
people want to believe that shit works.

1715
01:32:24,730 --> 01:32:25,481
Here's an example.

1716
01:32:25,481 --> 01:32:28,360
There was a stupid fucking thing going
around where people were wearing these

1717
01:32:28,361 --> 01:32:33,361
holograms rubber band and one
of the guys that was selling it,

1718
01:32:33,410 --> 01:32:35,530
uh, came to Vegas and God, man,

1719
01:32:35,531 --> 01:32:38,920
all these really talented athletes
who were swearing by this man,

1720
01:32:38,921 --> 01:32:43,390
it was kind of crazy. I was watching this
mass hypnosis. I mean, fucking Shane,

1721
01:32:43,391 --> 01:32:46,120
Karlyn was telling me how great they were.
Yeah. It really, really has helped me.

1722
01:32:46,130 --> 01:32:48,280
This, I'm like, dude,
you're a goddamn engineer.

1723
01:32:48,281 --> 01:32:51,310
You really think this chip a plastic
rubber band around your fucking risks.

1724
01:32:51,430 --> 01:32:52,570
It's a total placebo.

1725
01:32:54,410 --> 01:32:58,600
You'll actually drawing these positive
energy too. It's just like religion, man.

1726
01:32:58,601 --> 01:33:02,110
If you really do believe that you're,
you're, you're fucking gods soldier,

1727
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:05,300
you're out there doing God. You really
truly believe that man, you will be bad.

1728
01:33:05,320 --> 01:33:06,280
Who positive energy.

1729
01:33:06,580 --> 01:33:10,120
If you believe that praying to God
brings you what you want in life.

1730
01:33:10,300 --> 01:33:12,830
We really doing, he's just
transmitting your positive energy.

1731
01:33:13,180 --> 01:33:16,910
I want the swivel drawing these to me.
I've got to manifest in my life. Yeah,

1732
01:33:16,911 --> 01:33:19,510
and I mean it really does
work. Yeah, but so anyway,

1733
01:33:19,511 --> 01:33:22,720
so these guys are selling them in Vegas
and they're doing these carnival tricks

1734
01:33:22,721 --> 01:33:25,630
to sell them. The guy's like, okay,
straighten your arm out. All right,

1735
01:33:25,670 --> 01:33:28,240
now I'm going to give you the bracelet.
Now straighten your arm out and like,

1736
01:33:28,241 --> 01:33:30,760
what the fuck are you do? Like you
don't think I understand leverage.

1737
01:33:30,761 --> 01:33:34,040
You move your arm. You're in a different
position. Now this is like this.

1738
01:33:34,050 --> 01:33:36,370
This is working on MMA guys.
This is,

1739
01:33:36,580 --> 01:33:39,850
people want to believe
bullshit is my point.

1740
01:33:39,940 --> 01:33:44,500
This is 2011 and these crazy people
are still wearing these God damn rubber

1741
01:33:44,501 --> 01:33:47,800
bracelets with these holograms. So in the
life we live in the society we live in,

1742
01:33:47,801 --> 01:33:50,070
people are always looking
to get that upper hand.

1743
01:33:50,080 --> 01:33:52,210
You're looking to get
that slight edge or wow,

1744
01:33:52,360 --> 01:33:57,360
if this bracelet can give them an x slide
edge I my opponent edge of my work and

1745
01:33:57,371 --> 01:33:59,950
then want to believe that the price
is going to give them that edge.

1746
01:33:59,951 --> 01:34:01,800
Of course they give,
they made that.

1747
01:34:01,930 --> 01:34:06,070
They give themselves that edge naturally
by this self belief. Yup. Yup. Okay fine.

1748
01:34:06,071 --> 01:34:07,930
If the bracelet helped you do
it, but the price, like you said,

1749
01:34:07,931 --> 01:34:10,640
it's self does not have any magical power.
Isn't that the same in Australia?

1750
01:34:10,641 --> 01:34:14,160
It was a newspaper article that came
out exposing those prices for Torsion as

1751
01:34:14,170 --> 01:34:17,860
total complete, utter
horseshit. It's thievery.

1752
01:34:18,010 --> 01:34:20,740
These people are liars.
It's, it's really simple.

1753
01:34:20,741 --> 01:34:23,830
They really believe that a god damn
piece of plastic is going to change your

1754
01:34:23,831 --> 01:34:28,410
magnetic frequency. Shut the
fuck up. Okay. You know I,

1755
01:34:28,430 --> 01:34:31,900
I I in Hayden, I don't want you
arrested. You know, you made your money.

1756
01:34:32,170 --> 01:34:35,050
Congratulations. But it's
craziness. Yeah. Yeah,

1757
01:34:35,260 --> 01:34:38,410
but a lot of people want to believe in
it and it's interesting to me that people

1758
01:34:38,411 --> 01:34:41,230
are so anti performance enhancing drugs,

1759
01:34:41,470 --> 01:34:44,770
yet they'll wear a rubber band with
a fucking Hologram on it. You know,

1760
01:34:44,771 --> 01:34:47,980
like it's going to reprogram your system.
Like, wait a minute man, what do, what do,

1761
01:34:47,981 --> 01:34:50,890
what do you, what do you do doing that?
That's not natural. Is that, that's okay.

1762
01:34:50,980 --> 01:34:53,470
What if the, what does that Hologram
made you? Superman. Would the,

1763
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:56,500
you know what people still be
complaining about it with the Hologram.

1764
01:34:57,050 --> 01:35:00,350
You put it on and all of a sudden you're
jumping over tree tops. Yeah. You know,

1765
01:35:00,360 --> 01:35:02,780
I mean,
would you say now we have to take it off.

1766
01:35:02,781 --> 01:35:06,680
It's too good performance
enhancing drugs if it works at all.

1767
01:35:06,681 --> 01:35:11,120
It's performance enhancing. If it works at
all. It's natural. Yeah. It's so strange.

1768
01:35:11,150 --> 01:35:15,230
What arbitrary line in the sand
we draw as to what is a vitamin,

1769
01:35:15,231 --> 01:35:18,560
what is an athletic supplement
and what is performance enhancing?

1770
01:35:18,890 --> 01:35:20,060
What level does it yet,

1771
01:35:20,180 --> 01:35:23,450
because there's all that
shit is performance and ants
and goddamn vitamins are

1772
01:35:23,451 --> 01:35:24,980
performance enhancing a headache tablet.

1773
01:35:24,980 --> 01:35:27,170
Because you got a headache before
find its performance enhancing,

1774
01:35:27,171 --> 01:35:28,600
it's going to enhance the performance.
You know,

1775
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:33,230
anything can be constructed as performance
enhancing it. So it's vitamins are,

1776
01:35:33,560 --> 01:35:34,241
I mean if you're,

1777
01:35:34,241 --> 01:35:38,210
you're eating regular food and you get
to a certain amount of nutrients from

1778
01:35:38,211 --> 01:35:41,780
food and then on top of that you're
force feeding yourself massive doses of

1779
01:35:41,781 --> 01:35:46,460
vitamins B12 and fucking guess what your,
your that's performance enhancing.

1780
01:35:46,760 --> 01:35:50,210
I completely think it should be legal
and I think it's very healthy for you and

1781
01:35:50,211 --> 01:35:51,740
it's very beneficial for your body.

1782
01:35:51,741 --> 01:35:55,700
And I'm not saying that athletes
shouldn't take, and I'm saying what line,

1783
01:35:55,930 --> 01:35:59,280
where does that line get drawn?
What do you think about the,

1784
01:35:59,310 --> 01:36:01,460
here's a perfect example and I wanted
to talk to you about this coming on the

1785
01:36:01,461 --> 01:36:04,220
show. What do you, cause you
don't have a horse in this game.

1786
01:36:04,221 --> 01:36:06,950
What do you think about
this whole testosterone
replacement therapy thing like

1787
01:36:06,951 --> 01:36:09,620
this? What's going on with Nate
Marquardt and all these other fighters?

1788
01:36:09,950 --> 01:36:12,840
That's a tricky little thing isn't
it? It's difficult. You know you get,

1789
01:36:12,920 --> 01:36:16,180
if you go to testosterone depletion union
body and you need to take the drugs to

1790
01:36:16,220 --> 01:36:19,870
boost your levels up to that of a normal
personal event of the person you're

1791
01:36:19,871 --> 01:36:20,810
competing against.

1792
01:36:21,320 --> 01:36:24,680
Listen though we've Kaiser who I've
had my problems with in the past,

1793
01:36:24,681 --> 01:36:27,440
the head of the Nevada state athletic
commission took a very strong stance on

1794
01:36:27,441 --> 01:36:30,560
this and I support him and one of the
reasons why I support him as he won't

1795
01:36:30,561 --> 01:36:34,760
allow testosterone replacement therapy
for people who have tested positive for

1796
01:36:34,761 --> 01:36:36,980
steroids before.
And you know why?

1797
01:36:37,100 --> 01:36:40,430
Because people that test positive or
stars you ruin your fucking body when you

1798
01:36:40,431 --> 01:36:43,660
take steroids and you're nuts don't
work anymore and that's what's going on.

1799
01:36:44,270 --> 01:36:45,103
Right,
right.

1800
01:36:45,730 --> 01:36:50,730
Any fun cheeky club becomes like a dick
and I see his argument in that there

1801
01:36:51,680 --> 01:36:56,480
shouldn't be as far as you want to compete
as an athlete when you've ruined your

1802
01:36:56,481 --> 01:36:59,540
body from cheating, you
know there is, there is,

1803
01:36:59,630 --> 01:37:04,630
there's a strong moral statement to be
made there that I do see that point.

1804
01:37:06,140 --> 01:37:09,140
I'm not necessarily sure that I agree
with it because I think you should be

1805
01:37:09,141 --> 01:37:10,430
allowed to make mistakes in the past.

1806
01:37:10,431 --> 01:37:14,360
And I know how much performance enhancing
effect a cycle that you did six years

1807
01:37:14,361 --> 01:37:17,600
ago is going to have on today and it's
nothing. You might have damaged your body,

1808
01:37:17,601 --> 01:37:20,850
but it doesn't mean that you shouldn't
be able to stand up as an athlete and

1809
01:37:20,851 --> 01:37:21,350
perform.

1810
01:37:21,350 --> 01:37:26,030
But I think you probably should have
to do some sort of public relationship

1811
01:37:26,120 --> 01:37:29,840
explaining and maybe perhaps you
know, letting people know, hey,

1812
01:37:29,841 --> 01:37:33,230
please don't do steroids cause my balls
don't work anymore. You know what I mean?

1813
01:37:33,231 --> 01:37:33,581
You want to,

1814
01:37:33,581 --> 01:37:37,940
you want to compete as an athlete and
they should be much more stringent in your

1815
01:37:37,941 --> 01:37:41,270
testing when you're testing.
They got to watch you all year round.

1816
01:37:41,330 --> 01:37:45,950
They can't just because guys will get
super juiced and then they level off right

1817
01:37:45,951 --> 01:37:49,190
before they get on a cycle
and then they hide it.

1818
01:37:49,190 --> 01:37:52,640
There's there's masking factors you can
use the harder the way you it I believe.

1819
01:37:52,641 --> 01:37:55,920
I'm not sure. Maybe someone can tell us
as blood testing, he loved tech guys.

1820
01:37:55,921 --> 01:37:58,200
You can,
you can even detect human growth hormone,

1821
01:37:58,201 --> 01:38:01,650
which they're not doing in Nevada.
They're not doing blood tests.

1822
01:38:01,651 --> 01:38:06,420
He loved to play around a lot of this
and they recently got criticized by some

1823
01:38:06,421 --> 01:38:07,500
anti-doping,

1824
01:38:07,770 --> 01:38:10,740
something organisation was talking
about what the Nevada state athletic

1825
01:38:10,741 --> 01:38:13,310
commission is doing. And they're
saying there's two reasons why their,

1826
01:38:13,311 --> 01:38:15,900
their system is very ineffective, you
know, and then they're doing their best.

1827
01:38:15,901 --> 01:38:18,960
But the two reasons are, one, they're
doing just urine tests testing,

1828
01:38:19,080 --> 01:38:21,150
which just doesn't show enough to treat.
Man.

1829
01:38:21,151 --> 01:38:23,850
I've heard so many stories of so many
fighters and there they've cheated.

1830
01:38:23,870 --> 01:38:26,590
You're on tests to show
up with a nonhuman piss.

1831
01:38:26,591 --> 01:38:29,110
Like Kevin Randleman had some guns,

1832
01:38:29,160 --> 01:38:33,270
like got some possum pissed guys in
Japan that if you use Fike penises,

1833
01:38:33,330 --> 01:38:36,960
so the other guy standing next to them
and here in America and they're going to

1834
01:38:36,961 --> 01:38:40,350
fight fucking plastic deal that
actually has someone else's piece in it.

1835
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:43,140
So this squeezing out of the deek
someone else's piece that's clean,

1836
01:38:43,141 --> 01:38:45,150
obviously it's a urine wizard eight or I,

1837
01:38:45,151 --> 01:38:46,980
some of the commission is going to
get in touch that they can check.

1838
01:38:46,981 --> 01:38:49,750
It's for real. You know, it's
like, it looks like, right? Yeah.

1839
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:52,710
It's hard to figure out so they
have to stand like right over you.

1840
01:38:52,860 --> 01:38:56,760
So I guess these guys have to just get
that pissing with the fake dick down.

1841
01:38:57,150 --> 01:39:00,740
They've got to get really good at it yet.
But this is why he's a paypal Moscow.

1842
01:39:00,870 --> 01:39:02,930
If a guy's not shy though, you
can go, let me see your deck.

1843
01:39:02,970 --> 01:39:06,540
Let me say it and attach it
on and I would touch fake

1844
01:39:08,300 --> 01:39:12,240
fake death. Paula, I'm gonna
pull on it real quick. Pull on.

1845
01:39:12,241 --> 01:39:16,030
It just comes on and off. We're getting
shaken in front of them. Like a jellyfish.

1846
01:39:16,140 --> 01:39:17,910
You mother fucker.
This is a fake Dick.

1847
01:39:17,970 --> 01:39:22,020
How privileged you think growth is in
the sport? Huge. I think huge. And uh,

1848
01:39:22,050 --> 01:39:25,520
you know, there's been a few
controversies. There was a, you know, wow,

1849
01:39:25,620 --> 01:39:27,240
I shouldn't talk about that.
But look,

1850
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:30,570
here's the bottom line
thing that helps you.

1851
01:39:30,600 --> 01:39:33,390
Anything that makes your
body perform better for sure.

1852
01:39:33,391 --> 01:39:38,391
Someone who's living is stepping into a
goddamn cage and throwing their bones at

1853
01:39:38,730 --> 01:39:39,450
somebody.

1854
01:39:39,450 --> 01:39:42,510
And the only exceptions are going to
be someone who's an elite athlete who

1855
01:39:42,511 --> 01:39:44,940
doesn't need it. There's a lot
of guys who don't need anything.

1856
01:39:45,090 --> 01:39:47,020
Young guys who were recovering at a,

1857
01:39:47,021 --> 01:39:49,320
at a high level still
and they don't need it.

1858
01:39:49,321 --> 01:39:53,700
They're just high nutrition and taking
care of their body. But older athletes,

1859
01:39:53,701 --> 01:39:54,001
man,

1860
01:39:54,001 --> 01:39:57,810
when you get into guys you know that are
in their late thirties and for like you

1861
01:39:57,811 --> 01:39:59,190
see a guy like Bernard Hopkins,

1862
01:39:59,610 --> 01:40:03,480
I am not going to cast any speculation
as to what Bernard Hopkins is taking or

1863
01:40:03,481 --> 01:40:05,940
not taking.
I'm a Bernard Hopkins Fan.

1864
01:40:05,941 --> 01:40:10,110
I'm a fan of his technique of his
heart as a boxer, but that said,

1865
01:40:10,111 --> 01:40:15,070
isn't he like 46 years old? 46 and
he'd just be Pascal, you know for the,

1866
01:40:15,100 --> 01:40:17,580
for the the, the light heavyweight
belt, right. Was it light, heavy weight?

1867
01:40:17,581 --> 01:40:20,370
He found out the theme of the people
don't realize too is that guys,

1868
01:40:20,371 --> 01:40:23,040
I'm taking growth hormone just to get big.
That's what the common perception is.

1869
01:40:23,041 --> 01:40:23,580
Just want to kidnap.

1870
01:40:23,580 --> 01:40:26,670
You can get strong recovery recovery
time for the money and there's a lot of

1871
01:40:26,671 --> 01:40:27,750
singers that take it too.

1872
01:40:27,751 --> 01:40:31,830
I know of know a lot of famous singers
and actors that are getting on in years,

1873
01:40:31,831 --> 01:40:34,710
especially singers that have to go under
the duress of doing a lot of concerts

1874
01:40:34,920 --> 01:40:38,040
on the road. High intensity
style of living to take growth,

1875
01:40:38,100 --> 01:40:40,530
growth hormone just to keep young,

1876
01:40:40,920 --> 01:40:44,550
just to maintain a youthful
look and be able to recover.

1877
01:40:44,850 --> 01:40:46,080
The stressed I put on their bodies,

1878
01:40:46,260 --> 01:40:49,920
it's not just strictly limited to
athletes and the athletes for sure.

1879
01:40:49,921 --> 01:40:52,290
The ones who are going to need it because
they're the ones who they're worried

1880
01:40:52,291 --> 01:40:54,760
about their actual health.
When it comes to competing,

1881
01:40:54,910 --> 01:40:57,310
they're the ones who are really going
to need it and really going to want it,

1882
01:40:57,520 --> 01:41:02,110
and I always stress this you,
this is a finger.

1883
01:41:02,140 --> 01:41:06,520
The stopping steroids or stopping any
of this is a finger and a dam that is

1884
01:41:06,521 --> 01:41:08,740
eventually coming down because of science.

1885
01:41:08,830 --> 01:41:13,830
There's going to be a large scale
ability to manipulate your own genetics.

1886
01:41:14,920 --> 01:41:18,790
There's just, it's just
eventual it's going to happen.
There's no doubt about it.

1887
01:41:18,910 --> 01:41:23,910
They're looking into all
sorts of artificial organs
and recreating Oregon's and

1888
01:41:24,261 --> 01:41:28,750
labs and they've been successful in doing
this and successful and transplanting

1889
01:41:28,751 --> 01:41:30,000
these,
and they're,

1890
01:41:30,040 --> 01:41:34,450
they're working on manipulating the human
body at a very high level and they're

1891
01:41:34,451 --> 01:41:35,350
not going to stop.

1892
01:41:35,410 --> 01:41:38,290
So it's eventually going to keep going
in the same direction it's going.

1893
01:41:38,291 --> 01:41:41,440
And one of the direction is of course,
performance enhancing drugs,

1894
01:41:41,441 --> 01:41:43,990
anti aging drugs,
things that make people younger.

1895
01:41:44,140 --> 01:41:47,500
They've already discovered all sorts
of different ways to manipulate the

1896
01:41:47,501 --> 01:41:48,810
genetics to make,
you know,

1897
01:41:48,820 --> 01:41:52,240
my stronger than those things
called Myostatin inhibitors
that they've done with

1898
01:41:52,241 --> 01:41:53,350
mice.
And there's,

1899
01:41:53,380 --> 01:41:56,800
there's photos of whippet
dogs and apparently whippet
dogs are more susceptible

1900
01:41:56,920 --> 01:41:59,620
to this because of the way they
breed them and that, you know,

1901
01:41:59,621 --> 01:42:01,190
if they breathe them incorrectly,

1902
01:42:01,240 --> 01:42:03,550
if there's some sort of a mistake
in their pairing or whatever,

1903
01:42:03,730 --> 01:42:05,890
that one of the off shoots,
one of the,

1904
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:09,130
the fuck ups is this lack of
Myostatin inhibitors and these,

1905
01:42:09,220 --> 01:42:13,210
these whippets are giant super muscle
dogs that don't even look real.

1906
01:42:13,510 --> 01:42:16,780
They're going to be able to
do that to people, man. And
how fast we've become, man.

1907
01:42:16,780 --> 01:42:20,470
Can you mentioned being alive luck the
13th or 14th century when they had no

1908
01:42:20,471 --> 01:42:23,680
fucking medicine. Look, we
have now when a surgical tools,

1909
01:42:23,681 --> 01:42:27,790
we'll fucking knives and
souls and shit like that.

1910
01:42:27,791 --> 01:42:31,060
And you couldn't take a pint
hemp I painkiller headache,

1911
01:42:31,080 --> 01:42:33,310
tablet and nothing like that. I
was just like a Hawaiian, you know,

1912
01:42:33,311 --> 01:42:36,250
I was reading about the great
history of Hawaii and what,

1913
01:42:36,251 --> 01:42:39,520
what happened and how it became an
American state and all the whole deal.

1914
01:42:39,640 --> 01:42:43,630
And one of the things was about how when
a white people first came over to why

1915
01:42:43,660 --> 01:42:48,460
one fifth of the population died
from disease, really one fifth.

1916
01:42:48,490 --> 01:42:51,730
Ah, could you imagine? And
that's incredible, man.

1917
01:42:51,731 --> 01:42:55,570
That's just from 20% of your population
just and massage a couple hundred years

1918
01:42:55,570 --> 01:42:57,760
ago. No, I mean that's, that's
the amazing thing about it.

1919
01:42:57,761 --> 01:43:01,950
It's just a few hundred years ago, we'll
talk about that. Do you know that, that,

1920
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:03,820
that,
that downscaling of,

1921
01:43:03,821 --> 01:43:07,540
of humanity from you go back 5,000
years ago and the ancient Greeks and the

1922
01:43:07,541 --> 01:43:11,560
Egyptians in the ancient Romans
just was so fucking intelligent man.

1923
01:43:11,650 --> 01:43:14,590
When mapping constellations
where mapping countries,

1924
01:43:15,610 --> 01:43:20,170
building machines back then that all
of a sudden in the dark ages just all

1925
01:43:20,171 --> 01:43:23,740
disappeared. Like everything just
fucking went downhill in a big way.

1926
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:27,940
People are so flawed that is as
high as the heights can reach.

1927
01:43:28,060 --> 01:43:31,420
There's always going to be a
potential for a, a regress.

1928
01:43:31,590 --> 01:43:36,100
It was always like the tide comes in
and it goes out and I think it's always

1929
01:43:36,101 --> 01:43:37,210
moving forward,

1930
01:43:37,300 --> 01:43:41,290
but there's always a potential for
a Michele Bachmann type presidential

1931
01:43:41,291 --> 01:43:46,291
situation and religious
fanaticism overcomes the
earth and fucking nuclear war.

1932
01:43:46,361 --> 01:43:49,390
There's always a potential for that,
and then there must be a rebuild,

1933
01:43:49,391 --> 01:43:54,391
like it will always move
towards the positive and
towards the more comprehensive

1934
01:43:55,221 --> 01:43:59,180
and more evolved, but there's
always the potential for relapse.

1935
01:43:59,181 --> 01:44:01,670
So you don't want him to,
to luck, the Dogan tribe,

1936
01:44:01,671 --> 01:44:02,750
I think they're called an Africa.

1937
01:44:02,751 --> 01:44:06,780
These guys were fucking thousands
of ego mapping out constellations,

1938
01:44:07,010 --> 01:44:08,260
those kind of ones in their tribe,

1939
01:44:08,270 --> 01:44:11,330
in Africa with other guys who thought
they were from Mars. I think so, yeah.

1940
01:44:11,720 --> 01:44:14,390
Well visited from, from people
that took them in, in, in crafts.

1941
01:44:14,391 --> 01:44:16,760
The could show them a constellation
he ever get behind that,

1942
01:44:16,761 --> 01:44:19,980
that Mars theory shit and started to
looking at some of the things that are

1943
01:44:19,981 --> 01:44:22,830
people. I love reading that sort of
stuff about that. I'll have David Eco,

1944
01:44:22,840 --> 01:44:26,690
one of my favorite authors is a read
that sort of shit, but keep an open mind.

1945
01:44:26,720 --> 01:44:30,410
There's a stone right down the street
from my house when we were driving back.

1946
01:44:30,411 --> 01:44:33,980
I'm a point this out too, cause it's a
fascinating stone. It's just a rock band.

1947
01:44:34,250 --> 01:44:37,730
It's just a rock that sitting there,
but it looks like it was cut square.

1948
01:44:37,731 --> 01:44:42,440
It's not totally square, but it just
randomly turned out to be this rock.

1949
01:44:42,441 --> 01:44:43,820
The way it's shaped.
And you,

1950
01:44:43,821 --> 01:44:47,000
if you didn't know any better or if you
had a satellite and you were looking

1951
01:44:47,001 --> 01:44:50,840
from Mars, you know, and you were
studying earth and you saw that rock,

1952
01:44:50,841 --> 01:44:52,490
you'd be like, look, this is proof.

1953
01:44:52,610 --> 01:44:55,550
This is proof that intelligent
life is created this rock. But no,

1954
01:44:55,551 --> 01:44:56,271
it's just a rock.

1955
01:44:56,271 --> 01:44:59,000
Did it comes again from people will
believe what they want to believe.

1956
01:44:59,001 --> 01:45:00,500
When I was in Italy just a few weeks ago,

1957
01:45:00,501 --> 01:45:03,410
I went to my sister's wedding down in
this mountain town where she lives in

1958
01:45:03,411 --> 01:45:07,580
southern Italy. Towns. Got like 900
people in it. Okay. And it's nothing.

1959
01:45:07,581 --> 01:45:10,690
The town's one fucking bar.
It's old. Hundreds of years old.

1960
01:45:10,770 --> 01:45:13,580
Clooney and the Americans,
nothing there man.

1961
01:45:13,640 --> 01:45:17,390
Nothing there to see his fucking old town
up in the up in the top of a mountain.

1962
01:45:17,720 --> 01:45:21,080
But this town has this window and as soon
as we got there, this old dude's like,

1963
01:45:21,081 --> 01:45:23,720
oh got go to show you the,
the, the window of the Madonna,

1964
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:27,170
that window of the Madonna, it's so
famous. The pope came here to our town,

1965
01:45:27,320 --> 01:45:31,910
you know, years and years and years ago,
the boy and checked it out. So I'm like,

1966
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:34,250
okay, text me home. This
little alleyway techs,

1967
01:45:34,251 --> 01:45:37,460
Irene and I behind this alleyway and like
little fucking window. And he's like,

1968
01:45:37,730 --> 01:45:41,720
look, you see the Madonna?
Well the fucking what? What,
what are you talking about?

1969
01:45:41,900 --> 01:45:44,330
Cause the second window
across right on the inmate,

1970
01:45:44,510 --> 01:45:47,750
the Madonna tells this
oil stain on the window.

1971
01:45:47,870 --> 01:45:50,180
Like fucking someone had thrown
cooking oil on the window.

1972
01:45:50,660 --> 01:45:53,030
Then if you sort of looked at it and
he had that picture in your mind that

1973
01:45:53,031 --> 01:45:56,450
someone's telling you, it looks like the
Madonna, like the Virgin Mary, you think?

1974
01:45:56,451 --> 01:46:00,110
Yeah. Okay. It looks maybe like a
chick holding a baby as like, oh,

1975
01:46:00,111 --> 01:46:02,570
this is their big thing and the
Virgin Mary holding the baby,

1976
01:46:02,571 --> 01:46:04,680
the Madonna or a sign
on the window and it's,

1977
01:46:04,700 --> 01:46:09,560
for some reason there's fucking village
has managed to keep this oil stain on

1978
01:46:09,561 --> 01:46:13,730
his window for like the past
30 years. That's amazing. Yeah,

1979
01:46:14,490 --> 01:46:18,080
that's a, it's a fucking oil Stein. Pets,

1980
01:46:18,110 --> 01:46:19,520
people want to see what they want to see.

1981
01:46:19,521 --> 01:46:21,140
People want to see unto the Virgin Mary.

1982
01:46:21,650 --> 01:46:25,040
People go there and fucking pray to with
a pope apparently or rocked up at this

1983
01:46:25,041 --> 01:46:28,430
village fucking years ago and
yeah. Okay, cool. Listen, man,

1984
01:46:28,460 --> 01:46:32,530
there's a broad spectrum of human beings
and there's some dummies out there in

1985
01:46:32,540 --> 01:46:36,800
that and that's an intelligent tests.
That's what that oil painting is, man,

1986
01:46:36,801 --> 01:46:37,970
or that oil stain is,

1987
01:46:38,300 --> 01:46:40,880
it's an intelligence test and this is
going to be a lot of people that fail that

1988
01:46:40,881 --> 01:46:42,500
test.
That's just the way it is.

1989
01:46:42,501 --> 01:46:47,300
It's unfortunate and I don't see any way
around it until we figured out a way to

1990
01:46:47,390 --> 01:46:51,510
have like super intelligent robots that
do all the menial tasks that they need

1991
01:46:51,511 --> 01:46:54,360
really dumb people.
And when we do have that happen,

1992
01:46:54,690 --> 01:46:57,570
then it's going to be even more of a
problem because it's going to be some sort

1993
01:46:57,571 --> 01:47:00,090
of a, a weird, bizarre
welfare state where you know,

1994
01:47:00,091 --> 01:47:03,150
we're going to have to take care of all
these morons that we had given shitty

1995
01:47:03,151 --> 01:47:07,280
jobs before because they really don't
have anything to contribute to society.

1996
01:47:07,700 --> 01:47:12,060
She going to Tasmania fix it. You can't
do that. You can't export. You know,

1997
01:47:12,070 --> 01:47:16,680
as our society becomes more and more
self sufficient and more and more reliant

1998
01:47:16,681 --> 01:47:21,210
on computers, and then we don't need
people to do mundane retard tasks,

1999
01:47:21,450 --> 01:47:24,470
what the fuck man? It's, we're
going to have to figure out some,

2000
01:47:24,510 --> 01:47:27,210
there's going to be some sort of an
adjustment period where there's chaos,

2001
01:47:27,390 --> 01:47:30,290
where the, where the morons, you
know, what their rights, you know?

2002
01:47:32,450 --> 01:47:36,400
Yeah. For real man. I mean,
look, we, you, you can't turn a,

2003
01:47:36,401 --> 01:47:40,620
a group of people into little babies that
always need their daddy and then just

2004
01:47:40,621 --> 01:47:45,060
cast him loose in the woods
and said, sorry, no more
daddy. Daddy, they're going to,

2005
01:47:45,420 --> 01:47:47,130
they're going to hate that daddy.
They're going to come back.

2006
01:47:47,160 --> 01:47:49,050
I'm going to want revenge.
You know?

2007
01:47:49,051 --> 01:47:51,210
And there's a lot of people out
there that believe that they're,

2008
01:47:51,240 --> 01:47:54,480
they're guaranteed jobs. And that's what,
you know, politicians always talk about,

2009
01:47:54,481 --> 01:47:58,950
we're going to create jobs. Yes. Give
me a job. You won't be a fucking job.

2010
01:47:59,430 --> 01:48:00,263
You know?
That's the,

2011
01:48:00,400 --> 01:48:04,770
the point of this whole idea of everyone
working together is that everyone has

2012
01:48:04,771 --> 01:48:08,400
something to contribute. But the
reality is the way the system is set up,

2013
01:48:08,730 --> 01:48:11,910
there's a huge chunk of people that
don't have anything to contribute.

2014
01:48:11,911 --> 01:48:15,810
So they have to find some way to
plug themselves into the bureaucracy,

2015
01:48:16,080 --> 01:48:19,830
plugged themselves into this
complicated economic situation.

2016
01:48:20,130 --> 01:48:23,280
And that just defeats the whole
fucking purpose of the machine.

2017
01:48:23,610 --> 01:48:26,370
The whole purpose of the machine is,
everybody's got a little piece to play.

2018
01:48:26,371 --> 01:48:29,500
Everyone's got a little thing
to do and this is this place.

2019
01:48:29,640 --> 01:48:33,730
We're in such a weird state as far as the
evolution of society that we're, we're,

2020
01:48:33,731 --> 01:48:38,280
we're just getting past the need for
that. And when we do, what the fuck, man,

2021
01:48:38,281 --> 01:48:39,480
what are those poor
people are going to do?

2022
01:48:39,540 --> 01:48:42,690
That's why the elites want to drop
everybody down to 500,000 people.

2023
01:48:43,080 --> 01:48:46,680
If you talked to like Alex Jones, that's
what it'll say. The new world order,

2024
01:48:46,950 --> 01:48:50,620
they're going to drop everybody
down to 500,000 people and then, uh,

2025
01:48:50,670 --> 01:48:52,470
they're gonna,
they're gonna work with it from there.

2026
01:48:54,750 --> 01:48:57,820
When you think worldwide, I don't think
that's what we'll want. 500,000 people.

2027
01:48:57,821 --> 01:49:00,450
And I don't think there's not enough
people, man, that's not enough.

2028
01:49:01,890 --> 01:49:04,470
Not enough at all. But these
were just closed down. You could,

2029
01:49:04,500 --> 01:49:06,990
if you look two people,
10 people per city,

2030
01:49:07,020 --> 01:49:11,100
the idea is if you could kill most people
and then rock all the resources in the

2031
01:49:11,101 --> 01:49:15,510
world and have life extension and
that's the idea that you would have some

2032
01:49:15,511 --> 01:49:18,780
incredible ability to stay alive forever.
And you know,

2033
01:49:18,810 --> 01:49:22,710
if you did have like some crazy
like super technical life,

2034
01:49:22,740 --> 01:49:26,480
Aubrey de Grey life extension
technology that owned Neal,

2035
01:49:26,520 --> 01:49:29,400
the elites had a hold up and you
could live to be a thousand years old.

2036
01:49:29,580 --> 01:49:30,440
Well then you know,

2037
01:49:30,450 --> 01:49:33,810
you could have like harems and shit and
if there's only 500,000 people on the

2038
01:49:33,811 --> 01:49:36,720
earth, you could rock it just like a
king. But then who does all the shit work?

2039
01:49:36,990 --> 01:49:39,990
Give robots to do other robots doing
unless [inaudible] robots do all the shit

2040
01:49:39,991 --> 01:49:40,291
jobs.

2041
01:49:40,291 --> 01:49:44,550
There's only 500,000 people and you just
fuck everyone and you'll live forever.

2042
01:49:44,580 --> 01:49:47,900
So polygamy just running along
Caligula style, Bro. Fuck man.

2043
01:49:47,901 --> 01:49:50,230
That's probably the future. That's
what everyone's scared of, right?

2044
01:49:50,520 --> 01:49:54,630
When they talk about the apocalypse and
it's always talks of gluttony and mean

2045
01:49:54,680 --> 01:49:58,150
every story is the same. You know,
every story is this, this, this,

2046
01:49:58,151 --> 01:50:01,120
like the fall of Rome when what's told
to us, it's always the same thing.

2047
01:50:01,121 --> 01:50:04,870
They're fucking little boys and drinking
and vomitorium where they throw up and

2048
01:50:05,170 --> 01:50:07,270
go right back in to eat
again and they're just,

2049
01:50:07,300 --> 01:50:09,370
they were out of control and then they,
they fell apart.

2050
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:10,930
It's always the same goddamn story.

2051
01:50:11,170 --> 01:50:14,410
And if that is the same store with the
fuck are we doing right now? Yeah. I mean,

2052
01:50:14,411 --> 01:50:16,480
if we're not paying, we've
got to pay attention, pay
attention while we're doing,

2053
01:50:16,481 --> 01:50:20,140
would we win wars all over
the fucking planet? We're,

2054
01:50:20,141 --> 01:50:23,360
we're involved in all sorts of fucking
filth and craziness and the way we're

2055
01:50:23,370 --> 01:50:28,150
polluting the environment and fucking
devastating world economies and fucking

2056
01:50:28,151 --> 01:50:31,480
people over in third world countries and
providing what loans they can never pay

2057
01:50:31,481 --> 01:50:34,690
back and then Jack and all their
resources. I mean it's, you know,

2058
01:50:34,691 --> 01:50:38,260
it's one case after the other to show
that this is happening right now.

2059
01:50:38,290 --> 01:50:40,780
Do you mean back in those old days when
they were raping and pillaging that

2060
01:50:40,781 --> 01:50:45,430
right first then pillage or pillage
person then? Right. It's a combo package.

2061
01:50:45,820 --> 01:50:49,350
Whatever's going on your jollies off first
and then political, the golden sheet.

2062
01:50:49,351 --> 01:50:51,640
Would you go fucking take
all the golden shooting down?

2063
01:50:51,710 --> 01:50:54,850
My ripe a woman thing and half the fun
of the rape as you rape in front of

2064
01:50:54,851 --> 01:50:57,760
everybody while you're pillaging,
cause you just show you such a wild fuck.

2065
01:50:57,761 --> 01:50:59,710
You just see you're in the room.
Riping

2066
01:51:01,510 --> 01:51:05,000
oh you right into the stray man
everywhere. The comfort Roman days, Bro.

2067
01:51:05,320 --> 01:51:06,540
There was no comfort Raymond.

2068
01:51:07,590 --> 01:51:11,020
They'd write it down on the logs and rock.

2069
01:51:11,900 --> 01:51:14,470
It feels good for her. As long
as it feels good for you. Yeah,

2070
01:51:14,471 --> 01:51:16,830
there were just so much better. Right.
But these sites, which I'm glad, I mean

2071
01:51:18,390 --> 01:51:22,730
it's really good on the Internet. No
ma'am. And in Australia the break was,

2072
01:51:23,290 --> 01:51:26,370
it seemed to be trendy for criminals
and the IDS and [inaudible] nineties but

2073
01:51:26,380 --> 01:51:27,520
not many rapists these days.
Well,

2074
01:51:27,521 --> 01:51:31,600
you know what Australia wised up and did
legalize prostitution. Yeah, that's true.

2075
01:51:31,960 --> 01:51:34,320
That's a good point. It's a buffet. Forget
you guys don't have that a lot here.

2076
01:51:34,360 --> 01:51:37,930
Yeah, he's a big goddamn difference.
And even if you don't want sex,

2077
01:51:37,931 --> 01:51:41,200
you just want to go somewhere and get
jerked off in Australia during your lunch

2078
01:51:41,201 --> 01:51:44,820
break and get a 15 minute a hand job for
like 40 bucks. I don't know, brothel.

2079
01:51:44,830 --> 01:51:48,430
If you find one, you know there's plenty
around and it's clean and that's a wrap.

2080
01:51:48,460 --> 01:51:50,680
It's just a hand on your cock.
Just a nice little massage.

2081
01:51:50,681 --> 01:51:54,340
It's the big deal that a handle
the fucking cock. Exactly.

2082
01:51:54,580 --> 01:51:58,690
What's the big fucking deal? If you're
working with some chicken, you say to her,

2083
01:51:58,691 --> 01:52:00,790
listen, to give me a fucking
toss in the toilet cubicle.

2084
01:52:00,940 --> 01:52:04,390
What's the big deal of a chick putting
your hand in your cock and just if it was

2085
01:52:04,391 --> 01:52:06,490
only it was only that,

2086
01:52:06,550 --> 01:52:09,550
but they're worried that you're going to
leave and become in a relationship with

2087
01:52:09,551 --> 01:52:12,160
this swelling is really good at jerking
you off and then you're going to leave.

2088
01:52:12,190 --> 01:52:14,860
Yeah, that's what you know. That's
what the, that's what it's set up for.

2089
01:52:15,040 --> 01:52:18,520
Businesses employ a professional hand
job artist to come in and service dude's

2090
01:52:18,580 --> 01:52:21,910
like during their lunch break.
Just fuck. There you go. Next next,

2091
01:52:22,450 --> 01:52:25,720
next for the afternoon set up, ready
to go. It's set up to keep the family.

2092
01:52:25,870 --> 01:52:29,140
It's set up to make sure that
there's no threats to the family.

2093
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:34,180
And one of the threats to the family
unit is the man getting pussy and other

2094
01:52:34,181 --> 01:52:36,400
places and he's like,
why am I American this pitch?

2095
01:52:36,401 --> 01:52:40,060
Why am I supporting this system?
And that man will not pay as many taxes.

2096
01:52:40,061 --> 01:52:43,300
You won't be as successful. The money
will go talk to the woman and it's,

2097
01:52:43,330 --> 01:52:45,100
it gets distributed totally differently.

2098
01:52:45,440 --> 01:52:49,540
There's benefit and the man being involved
in the family, there's benefit in,

2099
01:52:49,650 --> 01:52:51,980
you know,
for a society mean if you go back to Rome,

2100
01:52:51,981 --> 01:52:55,280
the way they mapped out
how society should be,

2101
01:52:55,430 --> 01:52:57,920
one of the things was to
connect people with families.

2102
01:52:57,921 --> 01:53:00,950
That way men can be trusted
and become reliable. You know,

2103
01:53:00,951 --> 01:53:03,380
when men are single and they
don't have their own children,

2104
01:53:03,381 --> 01:53:06,630
they don't have a dog or a plant,
they're just wild fuck machine.

2105
01:53:06,650 --> 01:53:11,000
It's just that the mail goal is to just
fly to different spots all over the

2106
01:53:11,001 --> 01:53:13,680
planet, shoot loads, and then
get out of there. You know,

2107
01:53:13,820 --> 01:53:15,160
until they have responsibilities.

2108
01:53:15,161 --> 01:53:20,000
So it's very difficult to collect the
appropriate amount of taxes and to be able

2109
01:53:20,001 --> 01:53:21,870
to control that man. You know, it's you,

2110
01:53:22,200 --> 01:53:24,500
it's very hard to control
the wild single man.

2111
01:53:24,501 --> 01:53:28,580
That's why nobody wants a
single president. You know,
you want someone to go apps.

2112
01:53:28,610 --> 01:53:32,480
Do you really? Australian prime minister,
although it's not. Mary is a girl.

2113
01:53:32,780 --> 01:53:35,030
Julia Gilman,
she's probably eating pussy like a champ.

2114
01:53:36,500 --> 01:53:41,180
Chuck and bitches and Harry Reid had
to pussy to fire pushy. Is She gay?

2115
01:53:41,590 --> 01:53:45,560
Uh, no. No. Well, no. Apparently not. She
has a boyfriend is, I forget his name.

2116
01:53:45,560 --> 01:53:48,740
A partner, but she's not married.
No kids. Not Married. Good for her.

2117
01:53:49,040 --> 01:53:50,900
She'll be a good solid. Well, you look,

2118
01:53:50,930 --> 01:53:53,410
it takes every kind of people that
make this crazy world around them.

2119
01:53:53,480 --> 01:53:55,130
Maybe that's what it works
when you don't have an army.

2120
01:53:55,280 --> 01:53:56,840
But in America we would
never tolerate that shit.

2121
01:53:56,841 --> 01:53:59,780
I'll just tell you that right now. Maybe.
I mean, do you have an army in Australia?

2122
01:53:59,830 --> 01:54:02,760
Mustard? I'm just kidding. An Ami.
Yeah. Yeah. We're going to Australia.

2123
01:54:02,761 --> 01:54:06,140
Real specialty is lockout special ops.
And even the Americans will tell you that.

2124
01:54:06,141 --> 01:54:09,350
It's like the Aussie guy guys a nine foot,
let's say Afghanistan,

2125
01:54:09,410 --> 01:54:13,070
they send out guys in first like scouts
reconnaissance and we check out the

2126
01:54:13,071 --> 01:54:16,010
fucking scene and scope it out and then
the Americans and everyone goes in.

2127
01:54:16,160 --> 01:54:17,660
But that's what the
Aussie is a specialty at.

2128
01:54:17,661 --> 01:54:21,680
Is it fucking going in first scoping out
the fucking like Crocodile Dundee could

2129
01:54:21,681 --> 01:54:25,680
get like really close to the enemy's camp
and they wouldn't even know he was in

2130
01:54:26,750 --> 01:54:30,650
special forces. Uh, I think
it's called Sig special line.

2131
01:54:30,770 --> 01:54:33,440
So you have the CPS with
a sneaky little fuckers.

2132
01:54:33,441 --> 01:54:36,270
We go in early and we scared the
fucking shit out. That's a calling.

2133
01:54:36,271 --> 01:54:39,710
The Americans bombed the joint. All right,
you guys coming in and fucking, Ooh,

2134
01:54:39,950 --> 01:54:43,370
what a convenient relationship
that we have then. But yeah,

2135
01:54:43,371 --> 01:54:45,110
we're in the first where
was in there first?

2136
01:54:45,111 --> 01:54:49,280
So you do have an army and a woman
president, a female prime minister,

2137
01:54:49,400 --> 01:54:51,730
because we use the British
legal system per procedures.

2138
01:54:51,770 --> 01:54:54,410
People that think that could work here.
This is the next wave,

2139
01:54:54,411 --> 01:54:57,410
this Michele Bachmann wave.
And this Thera Pailin wave.

2140
01:54:57,411 --> 01:54:58,790
And here's what's interesting about it.

2141
01:54:58,791 --> 01:55:02,600
If you don't know Michele Bachmann is
married, first of all, to a gay guy.

2142
01:55:02,660 --> 01:55:07,660
She's married to a wildly gay character
who operates a pray the gay away clinic,

2143
01:55:09,980 --> 01:55:13,340
pray the gay. Oh one of those people tried
to pray the gay out of not only that,

2144
01:55:13,341 --> 01:55:16,460
they take, I believe they take tax
money for these fucking clinics.

2145
01:55:16,490 --> 01:55:19,250
They are allowed to somehow or another,
he's,

2146
01:55:19,251 --> 01:55:20,660
at least this has been
told to me on Twitter.

2147
01:55:20,870 --> 01:55:23,250
I shouldn't even repeat it
until I look into it. Uh,

2148
01:55:23,270 --> 01:55:27,650
but from what I understand that they
operate on, on some sort of tax money.

2149
01:55:28,130 --> 01:55:30,230
So some somehow or another
they operate on taxes.

2150
01:55:30,260 --> 01:55:33,140
I need to look into it to find out
that's true. But what is true for sure,

2151
01:55:33,260 --> 01:55:36,530
whether that guy knows it or
not, he's gay as fuck. He is.

2152
01:55:36,980 --> 01:55:41,030
He is gay as Ricky Martin and
airport hangar full of Dicks.

2153
01:55:43,330 --> 01:55:45,840
This guy's gay and he might,
he might not know it,

2154
01:55:45,841 --> 01:55:47,550
but the way he walks and the way he talks,

2155
01:55:47,730 --> 01:55:52,230
and he was talking about gay people being
barbarians, he called them barbarians.

2156
01:55:52,550 --> 01:55:57,550
And so all these gay dudes dressed up
as barbarians and went to his clinic and

2157
01:55:58,441 --> 01:55:59,550
there's a youtube video.

2158
01:55:59,551 --> 01:56:03,180
I tweeted it a few days ago is a youtube
video of these guys. And I tweeted,

2159
01:56:03,181 --> 01:56:06,840
the guy sent, sent me a thing like,
thanks for tweeting it and I go, dude,

2160
01:56:06,841 --> 01:56:08,100
is that you?
You're a fucking hero.

2161
01:56:08,970 --> 01:56:11,880
They showed up at this guy's
clinic and then they start,

2162
01:56:12,140 --> 01:56:16,670
they start acting like barbarians like
her and they're wearing like really campy

2163
01:56:16,680 --> 01:56:19,560
barbarian outfits. And
then at the end they, uh,

2164
01:56:19,561 --> 01:56:23,220
they take a photo and the guy's name is
Marcus Bachmann and all together they go,

2165
01:56:23,230 --> 01:56:28,140
Marcus, what's in your
closet? I mean, it's just,

2166
01:56:28,141 --> 01:56:31,290
it's so ridiculous.
They throw glitter on like Newt Gingrich,

2167
01:56:31,291 --> 01:56:35,520
they throw glitter on Michele Bachmann.
Like to, you know, to like, you know,

2168
01:56:35,580 --> 01:56:40,500
let them make them, make them, force
them to stay aware of, you know,

2169
01:56:40,590 --> 01:56:43,980
gay rights and gay needs. But do you
think sky Elton John or Ricky Martin?

2170
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:46,410
I think they're probably equally gay.

2171
01:56:46,530 --> 01:56:49,980
More Elton John because he's been around
back when there was no internet and you

2172
01:56:49,981 --> 01:56:54,981
could just go for crazy freak or ga
with sunglasses on and he gives it a,

2173
01:56:56,341 --> 01:56:58,080
receives it out in.
John gives it,

2174
01:56:58,081 --> 01:57:03,081
I would say Hilton's a giver except head
or think he receives the head but keeps

2175
01:57:03,481 --> 01:57:07,920
the fuck on and gives the
asphalt and Ricky, I say both.

2176
01:57:07,950 --> 01:57:09,960
He does whatever, whatever depth. Really.

2177
01:57:10,100 --> 01:57:12,270
He's fucking moving around
and he's moving and shaking.

2178
01:57:12,600 --> 01:57:17,130
He's not adverse to any kind
of experiences. Hey, you
say, oh, but you know one.

2179
01:57:17,131 --> 01:57:19,080
If you were gay you would say,
Oh the other way.

2180
01:57:19,110 --> 01:57:23,070
I have a friend who's gay comic and he
said, first time I saw pussy, I was like,

2181
01:57:23,110 --> 01:57:24,540
it.
When's it going to heal?

2182
01:57:26,820 --> 01:57:29,040
We used to have the sign when we're young,
we're talking about chicks.

2183
01:57:29,610 --> 01:57:32,280
Chick's pussy slide. Show
us where the exit. Yeah,

2184
01:57:32,850 --> 01:57:37,000
that as well when I was very young, but I
didn't remember. It shows for the media.

2185
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:42,870
Oh Man. What did I have? Elton John
and Rick. Why did you ask me that?

2186
01:57:42,900 --> 01:57:44,340
That's cause you're used to doing that.

2187
01:57:44,410 --> 01:57:48,060
Usually they will that whole fucking
voice versus you always have two quickie

2188
01:57:48,061 --> 01:57:52,590
questions. Throw people off. So with
Elton John and to be knocked out,

2189
01:57:52,591 --> 01:57:56,140
chug out Wedgie or head job of another
guy put the ball of fried train,

2190
01:57:56,150 --> 01:57:58,740
the Elton John's been around
for a long ass time. Dude,

2191
01:57:58,741 --> 01:58:01,740
he had some killer hits
though to fucking hell.

2192
01:58:01,800 --> 01:58:05,840
He had a weird relationship to like one
guy would write the song and he told him

2193
01:58:05,841 --> 01:58:09,000
and would write the songs and the ultimate
seeing them and Elton plays the piano.

2194
01:58:09,210 --> 01:58:11,360
Fucking genius artist,
genius artist.

2195
01:58:11,361 --> 01:58:16,361
But there's something I really appreciate
a guy who writes and produces all of

2196
01:58:16,861 --> 01:58:20,070
his own shit for whatever reason I,
it's like like a comic.

2197
01:58:20,071 --> 01:58:21,930
Like if I find out that
a comic has joke writers,

2198
01:58:22,140 --> 01:58:25,380
I don't like him as much as a comic that
doesn't have joke writers, you know?

2199
01:58:25,500 --> 01:58:27,510
And for whatever reason, man,
it's the same thing. Like,

2200
01:58:27,630 --> 01:58:30,510
I know that Elton John's
brilliant and I love his songs,

2201
01:58:30,660 --> 01:58:33,270
but I would like a more of he wrote them.
You know what I mean?

2202
01:58:33,480 --> 01:58:35,370
Does that make sense?
Are you still into to country music?

2203
01:58:35,371 --> 01:58:38,440
Cause last time we did the voice versus
your local get up country music industry

2204
01:58:38,630 --> 01:58:39,570
like Dwight Yoakam.

2205
01:58:39,571 --> 01:58:42,670
I like some country music and I like
some music that you wouldn't consider

2206
01:58:42,671 --> 01:58:46,540
country. Like I like Leonard Skinner,
right? Which is really like southern rock.

2207
01:58:46,600 --> 01:58:49,810
There's a lot of country and southern
lot like this is a song called the ballad

2208
01:58:49,811 --> 01:58:54,010
of Curtis Lowe. That's a
goddamn country song. You know,
it's a great song. There's,

2209
01:58:54,040 --> 01:58:56,400
but there's a, there's a
lot of, uh, it's just like,

2210
01:58:56,590 --> 01:59:00,460
it's a style of a American music that
I don't think that gets enough respect.

2211
01:59:00,461 --> 01:59:03,070
There's some jam and country songs.
Sorry, going back to gay people.

2212
01:59:03,580 --> 01:59:06,490
Apparently mixed martial arts has a
huge gay following. Oh, of course.

2213
01:59:06,491 --> 01:59:10,510
Huge gay following up men with perfect
bodies. Then get on top of the man.

2214
01:59:10,630 --> 01:59:13,870
I was talking to Andrew, Andrew Simon,
the CEO of HD net a couple of days ago,

2215
01:59:13,871 --> 01:59:15,430
and we'll talk about ratings and you know,

2216
01:59:15,470 --> 01:59:19,750
demographic of viewers and that needs
like huge gay viewership course huge gave

2217
01:59:19,751 --> 01:59:21,870
you or she, yeah, I would
imagine. Yeah, I would imagine.

2218
01:59:21,910 --> 01:59:23,330
Especially ones who like brutes.

2219
01:59:24,250 --> 01:59:28,030
Well he mentioned a guy going on like in
an abundance of a Broccoli, isn't it? Oh,

2220
01:59:28,031 --> 01:59:31,270
I've seen gay couples at fights
before. Oh really? Yeah, for sure.

2221
01:59:31,271 --> 01:59:35,340
Gay couples enjoying fights, guys who
you just know are gay, you know one guys.

2222
01:59:35,470 --> 01:59:38,900
Yeah, no doubt. No doubt.
I've seen it a bunch of times.

2223
01:59:38,901 --> 01:59:41,950
A guy goes to get the same reaction
that if he fucked a girl in the ass,

2224
01:59:42,370 --> 01:59:45,290
a Gill Neoss what do you
mean? Okay, so a guy got,

2225
01:59:45,300 --> 01:59:47,010
we'll fuck another gay guy in the ass.
Right?

2226
01:59:47,140 --> 01:59:50,140
But what a gay guy be opposed to
fucking a girl in the ass. I mean,

2227
01:59:50,141 --> 01:59:53,890
the house is still on us. I
think gay men. Look at women.

2228
01:59:53,930 --> 01:59:58,090
I'm a much more sexually than a straight
guy could ever look at a gay man.

2229
01:59:58,360 --> 01:59:59,470
You know what I mean?
Like too.
