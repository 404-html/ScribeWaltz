1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:00,600
Trey,

2
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:01,081
my day,

3
00:00:01,081 --> 00:00:03,750
Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.

4
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,450
It's like one one 35 first opened up.

5
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,190
It was in the UFC.

6
00:00:08,191 --> 00:00:08,510
It was,

7
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:13,510
there wasn't as many guys that were that
elite like even to watch the guys who

8
00:00:14,611 --> 00:00:16,140
are really good improve.

9
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,620
Like you saw the Cody fight where he was
fucking fantastic against Dominick help

10
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:23,640
God damn good to teach a look
against Linacre completely.

11
00:00:23,641 --> 00:00:25,620
No five Linacre nullified them.

12
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:26,490
We were going to Kurt,

13
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:31,490
he's like one of the best examples of
a guy with absolutely freakish physical

14
00:00:32,011 --> 00:00:34,530
attributes of fucking iron jaw,

15
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:35,340
iron Joe.

16
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,540
I'd never even seen the guy get hurt.

17
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,860
He gets hit by everybody,

18
00:00:37,861 --> 00:00:38,694
gets head kicked,

19
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,593
he gets punched.

20
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:41,610
Rob Font said he hit him
with the hardest punch.

21
00:00:41,611 --> 00:00:43,260
He ever hit anybody with
his life and he goes,

22
00:00:43,261 --> 00:00:44,550
he didn't even acknowledge
that he hit him.

23
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:47,040
He just walked right forties
and he hit him with a body shot.

24
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:48,540
Felt like he got hit by a car.

25
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:49,910
He didn't look like this,

26
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:50,700
that Linacre.

27
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,910
I don't think that same Linacre showed
up on Saturday or Friday and teaching all

28
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:54,391
fight them.

29
00:00:54,391 --> 00:00:55,161
He didn't have any days,

30
00:00:55,161 --> 00:00:58,680
but [inaudible] was very hesitant
and I think it was because of tjs,

31
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:00,260
the way he was fighting and with a faints,

32
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:00,900
the takedowns,

33
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:04,020
the kicks and throwing that
that head kick to the body kick.

34
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,690
But he was very tentative.

35
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:06,570
He got,

36
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:07,530
he got out beat,

37
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,550
you throw him in the truck,

38
00:01:08,551 --> 00:01:09,480
almost had them in a cab.

39
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,720
I thought he was going to go
for the twister and I was like,

40
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:13,351
oh my God,

41
00:01:13,351 --> 00:01:14,130
if he goes to the twister,

42
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:15,450
but he got went to the capsulize it,

43
00:01:15,451 --> 00:01:16,140
but I'm like,

44
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:16,651
I looked it up.

45
00:01:16,651 --> 00:01:17,670
Like he's not going to tap to that.

46
00:01:17,671 --> 00:01:18,750
It's just paying a stump.

47
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,440
He needed a stump down looked amazing.

48
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:23,250
Amazing.

49
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:23,461
Yeah.

50
00:01:23,461 --> 00:01:26,820
And the timing and those
takedowns like lightening bolts.

51
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:30,030
Like it looks like he's throwing
a punch and he's underneath you.

52
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:30,560
Just,

53
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,290
it was so nice.

54
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:32,310
He's so fast,

55
00:01:32,311 --> 00:01:33,000
man.

56
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,240
But God damn Cody Garbrandt what the fuck?

57
00:01:36,241 --> 00:01:37,260
God Damn.

58
00:01:37,261 --> 00:01:38,080
I'll admit I,

59
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,630
I said I think code is going to be champ.

60
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,620
Just not just,

61
00:01:40,621 --> 00:01:41,220
not yet.

62
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,170
He's gonna be your champ,

63
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,710
but he's not ready for dom yet.

64
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:44,721
No opening round.

65
00:01:44,721 --> 00:01:45,120
I was like,

66
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,050
what the fuck?

67
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,640
He's so busy mimic him.

68
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:48,810
He's doing break dancing.

69
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,310
He's doing push ups and shit.

70
00:01:50,311 --> 00:01:51,960
He fucked with Dominic's head.

71
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,520
And that was what one of
the things I was thinking,

72
00:01:53,521 --> 00:01:53,731
I was like,

73
00:01:53,731 --> 00:01:55,350
this kid's been in a lot of street fights.

74
00:01:55,351 --> 00:01:58,110
Like I don't know if there's trash
talk is going to work on him.

75
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,820
The way it works on other guys.

76
00:01:59,821 --> 00:02:01,590
Like he said he was fine in there.

77
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,491
Like I asked him,

78
00:02:02,491 --> 00:02:02,911
but he's like,

79
00:02:02,911 --> 00:02:03,601
I liked that.

80
00:02:03,601 --> 00:02:03,871
It goes,

81
00:02:03,871 --> 00:02:04,704
I feel calm.

82
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:05,161
He goes,

83
00:02:05,161 --> 00:02:06,870
I know I can stay calm
when that's going on.

84
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:07,360
And,

85
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,000
and I think he's just like
this young hungry dude who,

86
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:15,150
he took it personal and a lot
of guys get real emotional.

87
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:18,480
And I was worried that Cody come out
super emotional and just get merch like

88
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:19,171
taken down.

89
00:02:19,171 --> 00:02:19,470
Just,

90
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:19,741
you know,

91
00:02:19,741 --> 00:02:20,760
the real emotional like,

92
00:02:20,761 --> 00:02:20,940
uh,

93
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,200
all the dude against me,

94
00:02:22,201 --> 00:02:22,660
Gregor,

95
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:25,170
we just forget that I was technique
and rushes and gets marked.

96
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:26,251
But dude,

97
00:02:26,251 --> 00:02:29,550
he just took all that
and the best performance.

98
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,001
I mean,

99
00:02:30,001 --> 00:02:32,310
can you name another performance
like that where the guy,

100
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:33,301
he remembered,

101
00:02:33,301 --> 00:02:34,680
he was even number one contenders,

102
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:35,910
five or six in the world.

103
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:36,720
He was eight.

104
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,240
Was he a,

105
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,670
I thought I moved to six maybe,

106
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,290
but that might have been some shenanigans.

107
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,720
Just a who knows the
cheeto finger rankings.

108
00:02:42,721 --> 00:02:43,010
Yeah,

109
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:45,750
but still motherfucker went from five,

110
00:02:45,751 --> 00:02:47,250
six rank number one.

111
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:48,900
I'm the one that's a big stretch.

112
00:02:48,901 --> 00:02:49,590
Handily.

113
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:50,480
It wasn't a dumb one.

114
00:02:50,481 --> 00:02:51,120
One round.

115
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:51,730
Yeah.

116
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:54,180
And I love on me one one
or I'm Cody dropped him,

117
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:54,591
hurt him.

118
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:54,741
We,

119
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:55,081
we don't,

120
00:02:55,081 --> 00:02:57,570
we still don't exactly know
where the cut came from.

121
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,070
Some people were saying
he came from a punch.

122
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,990
Hear people online say came from a kick.

123
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:01,491
The Guy,

124
00:03:01,491 --> 00:03:02,150
definitely not.

125
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:05,200
But the guys in the trucks that it
was ahead by your truck boys were off.

126
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,370
Cause I heard when they said that,

127
00:03:06,371 --> 00:03:06,551
I'm like,

128
00:03:06,551 --> 00:03:07,720
what the fuck are they watching?

129
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:07,991
Yeah,

130
00:03:07,991 --> 00:03:08,271
they,

131
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:08,920
they uh,

132
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,731
pulled it up for me,

133
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:10,564
but it's hard.

134
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:11,081
See,

135
00:03:11,081 --> 00:03:12,670
while the fights going on,

136
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,511
they'll do that.

137
00:03:13,511 --> 00:03:15,370
And I'll tell me it's a head bud and see,

138
00:03:15,371 --> 00:03:16,720
I have two monitors in front of me.

139
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,140
I have one right here and then have one
over the side and they'll say like look

140
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:22,690
on monitor be and then they'll
show it to me but I can't really,

141
00:03:22,691 --> 00:03:25,750
it's hard for me to do that while
I'm watching the actual fight,

142
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,321
you know?

143
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:28,060
So they'll show it to me and I usually,

144
00:03:28,061 --> 00:03:30,240
I just take their word for it
but occasionally it gets too,

145
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,680
but I'm talking in the replay that they
showed maybe they saw different and

146
00:03:33,681 --> 00:03:36,480
didn't show the correct one to replay
that they showed it was definitely wasn't

147
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,070
the head but well they definitely
did collide heads for sure.

148
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:39,760
For sure.

149
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,690
And so who knows?

150
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:41,591
It was hard to tell,

151
00:03:41,591 --> 00:03:43,110
but who gives a fuck either.

152
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:44,230
It was a big ass cut,

153
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:47,200
big ass cut on Dom's
eyebrow and he got drunk.

154
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,460
How good is Dominick?

155
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:49,470
Cruz took a punch too,

156
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,740
but he gets in,

157
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,820
he gets cracked,

158
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:52,960
his legs go stiff.

159
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:57,550
He goes down and a couple of times Cody
like acted almost like he wasn't going

160
00:03:57,551 --> 00:04:01,450
to follow him to the ground and beat on
him on the ground and almost acted like

161
00:04:01,451 --> 00:04:02,284
he was done.

162
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:06,190
He was like calling him up or like a Mark
Hunt kind of walk off Caleb better get

163
00:04:06,191 --> 00:04:07,400
on and say did he do,

164
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:08,440
didn't even make an attempt.

165
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:09,490
Right.

166
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:11,650
Well maybe he doesn't want to have
anything to do with the ground.

167
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:15,400
Maybe feels like that's where Dominic
might have a chance to shush it down

168
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:16,243
there.

169
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:19,300
I don't know what Dominick
Cruz wanting to punish him to.

170
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:21,490
Maybe just Dominick Cruz
have any submissions.

171
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:21,781
Oh No.

172
00:04:21,781 --> 00:04:23,740
Dominick Cruz is really
good on the ground.

173
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:24,220
Yeah.

174
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,053
Hell yeah.

175
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:25,871
I mean on his record.

176
00:04:25,871 --> 00:04:26,651
Does he have any submissions?

177
00:04:26,651 --> 00:04:26,790
Yeah,

178
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:29,680
he has some missions usually from
guillotines though back in the day.

179
00:04:29,681 --> 00:04:31,390
Does he see his Jujitsu is really good.

180
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:31,870
Trust me.

181
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:32,021
No,

182
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:32,350
no,

183
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:32,621
no.

184
00:04:32,621 --> 00:04:33,221
You can't do with them.

185
00:04:33,221 --> 00:04:34,510
He's a black belt for sure.

186
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,160
I've seen him compete and
introduce the tournaments.

187
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,133
Yeah.

188
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:40,243
And uh,

189
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,530
and he wrestled as well.

190
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:42,460
He's a wrestler,

191
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,650
but for a guy not to go down in his guard,

192
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,760
that's some shit.

193
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,620
That's like some Conor Mcgregor,

194
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:48,311
Dia Shit.

195
00:04:48,311 --> 00:04:48,580
We were like,

196
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:48,691
ah,

197
00:04:48,691 --> 00:04:49,241
I just don't want,

198
00:04:49,241 --> 00:04:49,311
I,

199
00:04:49,311 --> 00:04:50,530
I can lose two easily down there.

200
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:50,740
Well,

201
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,330
I mean it might not have been that at all.

202
00:04:52,331 --> 00:04:54,010
It might have been even more simple.

203
00:04:54,011 --> 00:04:55,240
That's a lost Jamie

204
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:57,983
naked.

205
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:58,331
Yeah.

206
00:04:58,331 --> 00:04:59,980
So he's got a rear naked there.

207
00:04:59,981 --> 00:05:00,581
He's got,

208
00:05:00,581 --> 00:05:01,740
so he lost to a,

209
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:04,180
he's got one room naked Joe.

210
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:04,780
You're right.

211
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:05,331
Well who knows.

212
00:05:05,331 --> 00:05:05,990
So we do.

213
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:06,341
You still,

214
00:05:06,341 --> 00:05:07,510
you don't know what he could do.

215
00:05:07,511 --> 00:05:10,300
But the bottom line was Cody
wanted to keep the fight standing.

216
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,490
He just wanted to punish him.

217
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,290
Getting hit him so hard.

218
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:15,550
It might've thought the fight was over.

219
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,120
He,

220
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,450
he seemed to be the answer for Dominic.

221
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,920
I mean at least it worked for Cody.

222
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:21,500
Was it?

223
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,271
Or was it not?

224
00:05:22,271 --> 00:05:25,240
I'm no Stryker that he
made Dominic come to him.

225
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,230
And it's different when,

226
00:05:26,231 --> 00:05:26,950
correct.

227
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:27,700
Is that what it was?

228
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:27,821
Well,

229
00:05:27,821 --> 00:05:28,390
sort of,

230
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:28,991
but it's also,

231
00:05:28,991 --> 00:05:30,460
you got to give credit to his teams.

232
00:05:30,461 --> 00:05:30,551
He,

233
00:05:30,551 --> 00:05:32,950
Justin Buchholz and those
guys had been imitating.

234
00:05:32,951 --> 00:05:34,420
They fought dom so many times,

235
00:05:34,421 --> 00:05:34,670
six,

236
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:34,831
nine.

237
00:05:34,831 --> 00:05:37,900
You can imitate his movements
so they can mimic his shit.

238
00:05:37,901 --> 00:05:38,830
So when they're sparring,

239
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:39,640
they do that,

240
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,250
that fake stuff that like false start.

241
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:42,640
You know,

242
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,970
cause dom does this thing where he
false starts and then he'd start and you

243
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:47,500
never know which one's going to be a kick,

244
00:05:47,501 --> 00:05:49,180
which is a lot of like,

245
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,160
like patterns at dom throws up.

246
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,820
So they figured out how to do that and
they mimicked and they watched him so

247
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:57,040
many times that they can get it down to a,

248
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,480
and Cody didn't buy into the fates.

249
00:05:59,570 --> 00:05:59,961
You're just like,

250
00:05:59,961 --> 00:06:01,010
come on if you're going to come on,

251
00:06:01,011 --> 00:06:02,450
come in within this range.

252
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,760
And he kept baiting him and
[inaudible] and they'd make account.

253
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:04,941
Yeah.

254
00:06:04,941 --> 00:06:08,540
The bottom line is if his brain's not
confused and he just knows that in these

255
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:09,141
exchanges,

256
00:06:09,141 --> 00:06:11,510
Dom's going to be there
and he's going to do some,

257
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,410
you know,

258
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:14,390
he's got some really
unpredictable movement.

259
00:06:14,391 --> 00:06:15,170
Dom does,

260
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:17,240
but he does like a bunch of things a lot.

261
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:17,960
And then commit.

262
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,171
Yeah.

263
00:06:18,171 --> 00:06:20,800
And so he timed those
things and Cottonwood,

264
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,610
some fucking vicious punches,

265
00:06:22,611 --> 00:06:23,180
man.

266
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:23,361
Yeah.

267
00:06:23,361 --> 00:06:23,610
And a,

268
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:23,841
yeah,

269
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:24,350
he wasn't,

270
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,000
you'll like dom fight Talala guys.

271
00:06:26,001 --> 00:06:26,331
And they're like,

272
00:06:26,331 --> 00:06:27,380
what duff fuck?

273
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,250
It's like that Chris Ducker,

274
00:06:28,251 --> 00:06:29,480
maybe we get to in the face of guy,

275
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,910
which one y'all kicked me and you
don't know where it's coming from,

276
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:33,830
but can you just,

277
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:34,370
uh,

278
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:36,000
he just Garbrandt just never bought it.

279
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,730
Like I'm just gonna
wait for you to commit.

280
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:40,160
You can do all that jazz and I'm
just going to wait right here.

281
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:43,490
It's also a guy's been boxing when he was
real young when you were talking about

282
00:06:43,491 --> 00:06:44,060
last night.

283
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:44,360
Yeah.

284
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,270
It was eight 32 and two amateur record.

285
00:06:47,271 --> 00:06:48,104
You look at that,

286
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,640
but in the UFC compared to other fighters,

287
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,660
that boxing comes in handy.

288
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,220
Huge.

289
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,180
He was coaching,

290
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:56,870
he was,

291
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:59,960
Cody was catching Dominick
Cruz on the way out.

292
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:03,980
[inaudible] which that's a lot of people
don't catch him on the way and never

293
00:07:03,981 --> 00:07:04,430
see it.

294
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:04,790
No,

295
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:09,070
he was catching them on the way up and
the speed and precision of his punching

296
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:09,913
power.

297
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,690
Glorious for five rounds.

298
00:07:11,691 --> 00:07:14,240
And then people forget
Cody in high school.

299
00:07:14,241 --> 00:07:14,421
He,

300
00:07:14,421 --> 00:07:16,540
I think he was first team
all state out of Ohio,

301
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:17,720
which is big deal out there.

302
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:18,861
He had scholarships,

303
00:07:18,861 --> 00:07:19,820
Played Division One,

304
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:20,511
or I'm sorry,

305
00:07:20,511 --> 00:07:22,010
compete in division one wrestling.

306
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:22,371
It was like,

307
00:07:22,371 --> 00:07:22,581
Nah,

308
00:07:22,581 --> 00:07:24,230
I'm just going to fight
professionally and full time.

309
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,660
That's what kind of stud
you're dealing with.

310
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:30,020
And his uncle was an alternate
for the Olympic boxing team,

311
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:30,980
so I mean,

312
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:34,190
he comes from a long line of
just savages do pretty crazy.

313
00:07:34,191 --> 00:07:34,521
Yeah.

314
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:34,881
This,

315
00:07:34,881 --> 00:07:36,680
his countdown piece was pretty amazing.

316
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,860
[inaudible].
