00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:02,880
Hello Freak bitches,

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:08,090
that's the problem in psychiatry is
there are no real biological markers.

3
00:00:08,431 --> 00:00:12,480
They're trying to use a radiographic
studies like Spec Scans,

4
00:00:12,481 --> 00:00:13,314
Mris,

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,700
pet scans and what have you as rationale
for starting people on medication,

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,170
but there's absolutely,

7
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:19,441
you know,

8
00:00:19,441 --> 00:00:20,430
in the biomarker,

9
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,140
the biomarker panel that we have,

10
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:27,030
this is a direct correlation
between someone having had
a head trauma regardless

11
00:00:27,031 --> 00:00:32,031
of it was Mildura blast trauma like
Andrew had or a slip and fall or someone

12
00:00:32,341 --> 00:00:37,341
coming up and hitting you behind the
head or mma or boxers or mou type and

13
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:41,450
there's absolutely zero that they
use to regulate what they're doing.

14
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:41,851
It says,

15
00:00:41,851 --> 00:00:42,630
okay,

16
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:43,620
today's Thursday,

17
00:00:43,621 --> 00:00:48,030
let's try this drug or this is Friday
or else this month we're giving you this

18
00:00:48,031 --> 00:00:49,110
Satchel of meds.

19
00:00:49,111 --> 00:00:51,030
As many of the vets have
come up and told me,

20
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,530
depending upon the day
of the week dictated what
groupings of medications they

21
00:00:55,531 --> 00:00:57,020
were given and so what,

22
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,590
but let's break it down for people.

23
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:01,790
What do you feel is the
underlying cause of all this?

24
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:03,210
It's related to Tbi.

25
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,133
Okay,

26
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,251
great question,

27
00:01:05,251 --> 00:01:06,840
and the answer is number one,

28
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:07,890
from the head trauma,

29
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:12,300
it elicits chemical changes in the
brain that we call inflammation and this

30
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,740
inflammation leads to disruption
of chemical processes.

31
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:17,490
It's like,

32
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:17,731
you know,

33
00:01:17,731 --> 00:01:21,480
the old alkaline batteries or the car
batteries where we used to put distilled

34
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:22,200
water into it.

35
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:22,321
Well,

36
00:01:22,321 --> 00:01:23,640
if you put coca cola in it,

37
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:28,820
it totally changes the ability of
electrons to be conducted just like in the

38
00:01:28,861 --> 00:01:29,694
brain.

39
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,330
So the chemistry of the brain is altered
by the inflammation and it starts

40
00:01:33,331 --> 00:01:37,500
shutting down systems so that the nerves
in left side of the brain can talk to

41
00:01:37,501 --> 00:01:41,040
the right side or the frontal lobe of the
brain can talk to the temporal lobe of

42
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:41,730
the brain.

43
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:45,510
So you have disruption
of executive function,

44
00:01:45,511 --> 00:01:49,860
which is your ability to make correct
decisions about things right and wrong.

45
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,220
Why do we have over a million
veterans incarcerated?

46
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:57,750
That's because they can't make the right
correct decisions about how to respond

47
00:01:57,751 --> 00:01:59,460
to an innocuous,

48
00:01:59,490 --> 00:01:59,801
uh,

49
00:01:59,801 --> 00:02:00,390
you know,

50
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:05,390
approached by an individual that they
don't know and they respond by assault or

51
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:09,270
physical or anger or
the yelling at people.

52
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,780
And that leads them into
jail or into incarceration.

53
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,913
So anyway,

54
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,370
the inflammation leads to hormonal
deficiencies in the brain.

55
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,990
And what we found is that there's,

56
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:20,520
since 1986,

57
00:02:20,521 --> 00:02:25,521
Dr Lou at a Paris found that we have
enzyme systems that take cholesterol and

58
00:02:26,371 --> 00:02:31,371
converted into hormones that actuate
and regulate our brain function from

59
00:02:31,801 --> 00:02:36,030
schizophrenia to als to
Parkinson's disease to bipolar,

60
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:38,340
to all the different disorders.

61
00:02:38,341 --> 00:02:42,000
There was a recent article that I sent
out to our journal Group and Andrew's in

62
00:02:42,001 --> 00:02:42,600
it,

63
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,930
and it was about management
of neuroinflammation,

64
00:02:45,931 --> 00:02:49,140
brain inflammation to
treat psychiatric diseases.

65
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,760
In the past six months,

66
00:02:50,761 --> 00:02:53,880
we've been starting to see a lot of
articles talking specifically about

67
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:54,870
inflammation,

68
00:02:54,871 --> 00:02:59,160
creating all these things that we're
trying to treat with medications that are

69
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:00,063
ineffective.

70
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:00,540
Uh,

71
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,373
last month,

72
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,223
uh,

73
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,370
had a class in

74
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:09,870
Arizona and I presented a
group of articles and one
of the key articles was the

75
00:03:10,151 --> 00:03:14,320
fact that they found people with a
typical depression that's depression that

76
00:03:14,321 --> 00:03:17,410
doesn't respond to traditional medication.

77
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:21,550
So you're on whole bunch of 13
medications and you still depressed.

78
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:26,680
So they found in 61 percent of these
people who were still depressed with

79
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:30,760
atypical depression that they had growth
hormone deficiency and then when they

80
00:03:30,761 --> 00:03:33,520
replaced the growth hormone
within one to two months,

81
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:37,240
their depression disappeared and they
had some beneficial side effects.

82
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:38,590
They slept better,

83
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,360
they had more mental energy,

84
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:45,630
they were socially more adaptable and
they're reactive scores that creates an

85
00:03:46,091 --> 00:03:47,380
assault situation.

86
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,200
They were calm.

87
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,600
Someone said boo to them and they said,

88
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:49,930
Oh,

89
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,750
who do you as opposed to
getting into their face.

90
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:58,020
So it's a very clear and it's becoming
clearer and clearer in the literature

91
00:03:58,151 --> 00:03:58,960
around the world.

92
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:03,960
Now we've been doing this since 2004 and
the inflammation is really the problem.

93
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:09,910
So unfortunately there is
no specific medication.

94
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:15,060
They talk about use of aspirin
and Ibuprofen in things
like Alzheimer's disease,

95
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:17,200
which is an inflammatory disease.

96
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:22,590
I know I shared it with you in the past
that if a football player has one major

97
00:04:22,811 --> 00:04:24,070
concussion on the field,

98
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,160
he's 19 times at greater risk
of developing Alzheimer's
between 30 and 49 years

99
00:04:29,981 --> 00:04:32,530
of age because it's an
inflammatory illness.

100
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:36,040
It's not genetics by itself.

101
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:39,220
There are people with
genetic predisposition to it
because they generate this

102
00:04:39,221 --> 00:04:40,300
thing called Beta amyloid,

103
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:41,493
but trauma,

104
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:46,630
any kind of trauma to the head can elicit
increased production of Beta amyloid

105
00:04:46,631 --> 00:04:47,740
and lead to these problems.

106
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:48,440
I get.

107
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,071
I get heavy.

108
00:04:49,071 --> 00:04:50,870
You know I'm going to
talk about life and death.

109
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,370
You got talk about life now.

110
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,350
That is what we're doing.

111
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,850
We're living in some people who are dying.

112
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:00,283
That's life and death.

113
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,130
We're all.

114
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:03,260
What's really interesting is
that we're all going to die.

115
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,150
Yes.

116
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:09,150
And add that everybody pushes away and
I guess that's normal to push away,

117
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:14,210
you know,

118
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:15,500
thoughts of your death,

119
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:17,090
but the real enlightened,

120
00:05:17,091 --> 00:05:17,924
like the Buddhist,

121
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:18,920
Buddhist,

122
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,753
eastern,

123
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,541
eastern and stuff,

124
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:24,860
they say the way to get
enlightened is to die.

125
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:25,790
If you can check this out,

126
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:29,870
is to die before you die.

127
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:34,930
Meaning lately kind of go into the
fear and they claim that the fear is

128
00:05:38,631 --> 00:05:40,250
releasing ego,

129
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,850
which what they mean by ego is like,

130
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:48,190
like you have this beautiful studio when
you have a career and a wife and a kid.

131
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:48,621
Kids,

132
00:05:48,621 --> 00:05:49,450
I guess.

133
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:50,283
And,

134
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,260
and it's like letting.

135
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:58,580
It's like you can't be attached to it,

136
00:05:58,581 --> 00:06:01,100
you have to die to that.

137
00:06:01,101 --> 00:06:01,701
Like in other words,

138
00:06:01,701 --> 00:06:03,050
you don't own your wife,

139
00:06:03,051 --> 00:06:04,280
you don't own,

140
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:05,803
um,

141
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,760
anything really because we're just,

142
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:08,630
we're.

143
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:09,970
The bottom line of it is,

144
00:06:09,971 --> 00:06:11,630
is we are temporary.

145
00:06:11,631 --> 00:06:13,490
Yes and empowerment it.

146
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:16,700
And it doesn't mean you can't enjoy,

147
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:17,181
you know,

148
00:06:17,181 --> 00:06:19,850
like you're in the prime of your life,

149
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,480
right?

150
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,590
So why think about your fucking death,

151
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,880
you know what I mean?

152
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,120
And

153
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:31,120
then the incredible institutional
entrenchment that happens when you adopt a

154
00:06:31,611 --> 00:06:32,444
certain view,

155
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:32,900
right?

156
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:37,900
And then it's so hard to reverse out of
that particular chosen line of thinking,

157
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,550
it becomes almost impossible.

158
00:06:40,551 --> 00:06:40,790
You know,

159
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:42,710
this institutions are not built for that.

160
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,690
They're not really built for science.

161
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:45,321
You know,

162
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:46,520
science is supposed to be,

163
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,713
as I said earlier,

164
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,370
self-doubting self questioning.

165
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,630
You have new observations,

166
00:06:50,631 --> 00:06:51,650
so you change your course.

167
00:06:51,651 --> 00:06:53,490
That's what science is
supposed to be like you,

168
00:06:53,491 --> 00:06:55,040
you test things and they don't work out.

169
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:56,510
And then you move on to another idea.

170
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,830
But an institution is,

171
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:03,890
is it's almost like institutional
sciences click an oxymoron because an

172
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:06,800
institution is meant to not
flip flop on their publics.

173
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,240
Not to change their views,

174
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,103
not to lose,

175
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:11,510
not to allow people to lose faith in them.

176
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:12,670
So it's,

177
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:14,040
it's there,

178
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:14,580
it's,

179
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:14,820
it's,

180
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:18,380
it's the wrong kind of body to do science.

181
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,293
Um,

182
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:21,740
so it's made me much more,

183
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:27,020
a much more cautious about how
much I want our government to do,

184
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:27,680
um,

185
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,400
because if I had just turned over this
one little leaf and found this huge

186
00:07:31,401 --> 00:07:32,900
disastrous program,

187
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:33,291
uh,

188
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:33,561
you know,

189
00:07:33,561 --> 00:07:35,980
I just wonder if I'd
turned over any other leaf.

190
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:36,400
What,

191
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:36,530
uh,

192
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:36,890
what,

193
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:37,910
what else would I find?

194
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,750
I think you'd find similar
in competence probably.

195
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:41,480
Yeah.

196
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,140
So,

197
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:42,973
um,

198
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,680
so it's changed my political
thinking quite a bit.

199
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:46,623
Um,

200
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:48,800
and then I think it's also,

201
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:49,020
you know,

202
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:52,820
when I see the way that the
scientific debate is played out and I,

203
00:07:52,821 --> 00:07:53,391
and you know,

204
00:07:53,391 --> 00:07:55,700
I know the science so intimately now,

205
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,593
um,

206
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,590
you know,

207
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:02,590
I know I've read every single nutrition
experiment that has really been done

208
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:04,880
since the mid fifties.

209
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:05,211
And,

210
00:08:05,211 --> 00:08:05,361
you know,

211
00:08:05,361 --> 00:08:07,610
when I see the way the
debate plays out in public,

212
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:08,060
you know,

213
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,250
I see that a American heart association,

214
00:08:10,251 --> 00:08:11,540
Presidential Advisory,

215
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:12,610
which I just see as a,

216
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:12,960
you know,

217
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,090
it's not honest science or
our last dietary guidelines,

218
00:08:17,091 --> 00:08:19,160
expert committee in their report saying,

219
00:08:19,161 --> 00:08:19,994
you know,

220
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,103
we should,

221
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,150
we should all eat a plant based diet.

222
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:23,331
And I,

223
00:08:23,331 --> 00:08:23,571
you know,

224
00:08:23,571 --> 00:08:25,910
I can see how bad that science is.

225
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,833
And so,

226
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:28,520
you know,

227
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,240
I see that,

228
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,690
that I can see now so much better the,

229
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:32,440
the,

230
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:37,220
the way that PR firms spin messages and
the way those messages are echoed all

231
00:08:37,221 --> 00:08:37,881
over and the way,

232
00:08:37,881 --> 00:08:38,061
you know,

233
00:08:38,061 --> 00:08:39,950
it's just the way it's what's
happening in our politics.

234
00:08:39,951 --> 00:08:40,230
It's,

235
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,600
it's happening in our science.

236
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:42,260
Um,

237
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:42,640
and,

238
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,640
and so I think it makes me somewhat
despair about our ability to have good

239
00:08:50,691 --> 00:08:54,560
science rise to the top because you knew
when you have institutions like Harvard

240
00:08:54,561 --> 00:08:55,394
and tufts,

241
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:55,740
you,

242
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:59,760
all of our top institutions are so
deeply invested in this wrong hypothesis.

243
00:08:59,761 --> 00:09:00,451
Yet I don't even know.

244
00:09:00,451 --> 00:09:03,210
I don't know where people should turn to,

245
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:03,840
to,

246
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,051
you know,

247
00:09:04,051 --> 00:09:04,440
how,

248
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,360
how do we sort ourselves out of this mess?

249
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:08,243
Um,

250
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,250
so yeah,

251
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:09,671
nutrition,

252
00:09:09,671 --> 00:09:11,130
science is in bad shape and I,

253
00:09:11,131 --> 00:09:11,460
and it,

254
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,570
it changed my,

255
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,750
it's changed my faith in expert advice.

256
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:17,010
Maybe that's the bottom line.

257
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:22,070
I really don't trust expert advice
because I see the way it is manipulated by

258
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:27,950
financial interests and professional
interests and intellectual conflicts of

259
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:30,120
interest and,

260
00:09:30,121 --> 00:09:30,631
and so,

261
00:09:30,631 --> 00:09:30,810
you know,

262
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:32,730
even little tiny things like anything,

263
00:09:32,731 --> 00:09:34,140
a warning label on a bottle,

264
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:34,411
like,

265
00:09:34,411 --> 00:09:35,244
you know,

266
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:37,470
careful of this plastic or this or that.

267
00:09:37,471 --> 00:09:37,800
I'm like,

268
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,040
I don't believe anything unless I go back
to their original science and read it

269
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:42,000
all myself,

270
00:09:42,001 --> 00:09:42,960
which I can never do.

271
00:09:42,961 --> 00:09:44,700
I just don't trust anything anymore.

272
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,440
That's not a good place to be.

273
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,333
It isn't.

274
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:48,520
I need to spend.
