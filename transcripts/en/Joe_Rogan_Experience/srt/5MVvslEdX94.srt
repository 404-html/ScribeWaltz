1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:02,963
Three,

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:04,343
two,

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:05,633
one

4
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:09,270
the great and powerful Pat Miller touch.

5
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:10,921
I don't know about that,

6
00:00:10,921 --> 00:00:11,700
but you are.

7
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:12,281
Listen man,

8
00:00:12,281 --> 00:00:12,390
I'm,

9
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:13,500
it's an honor to have you in here.

10
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,720
I've been watching your show for a long
time and you're a contrarian thinker.

11
00:00:18,721 --> 00:00:19,470
I love it.

12
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:20,490
And you've,

13
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,410
you've prompted a lot of
people to think differently,

14
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:23,570
right?

15
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:24,210
Uh,

16
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:25,220
maybe it means,

17
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,450
I think information prompts
people to think differently.

18
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:27,930
Well,

19
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,850
when they get pounded with
us enough and hear it enough,

20
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:31,530
eventually it starts to sink in,

21
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:32,130
right?

22
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:32,431
Yeah,

23
00:00:32,431 --> 00:00:32,881
I think so,

24
00:00:32,881 --> 00:00:33,091
man.

25
00:00:33,091 --> 00:00:33,930
And when you talk about,

26
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:34,793
um,

27
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,710
guys who have been around like you,

28
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,320
you are one of the real pioneers of MMA.

29
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:40,711
You know,

30
00:00:40,711 --> 00:00:42,480
it's one of the reasons why I
really wanted to have you in here.

31
00:00:42,481 --> 00:00:43,740
I remember back when you were fighting,

32
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,980
I remember back when you fought
Matt Hume and what was that like?

33
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,410
Extreme Strand.

34
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:48,900
Okay.

35
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:49,051
Yeah.

36
00:00:49,051 --> 00:00:50,430
That was John Peretti's thing.

37
00:00:50,431 --> 00:00:50,810
I mean,

38
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:51,031
dude,

39
00:00:51,031 --> 00:00:52,260
you've been around,

40
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,221
you've been around.

41
00:00:53,221 --> 00:00:54,750
You were the early days.

42
00:00:54,751 --> 00:00:55,770
Bare knuckle.

43
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,060
Yeah.

44
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:56,301
Yeah.

45
00:00:56,301 --> 00:00:56,710
No,

46
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:57,660
you know when the thing is,

47
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:58,621
I always tell people,

48
00:00:58,621 --> 00:00:59,860
Dan Severn yeah,

49
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:03,510
we flock to withdraw who's
270 pounds at the time.

50
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,270
And he was still obviously
pretty tough back then.

51
00:01:06,271 --> 00:01:07,021
Still Pretty Mobile.

52
00:01:07,021 --> 00:01:07,530
It was not a,

53
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:08,341
not a fun fight.

54
00:01:08,341 --> 00:01:10,440
I can tell you carrying his
weight around for 30 minutes,

55
00:01:10,441 --> 00:01:11,910
but it was tough.

56
00:01:11,911 --> 00:01:15,630
But Matthew human was the guy that made
me realize that I wasn't a fighter yet

57
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:16,720
cause I was 15 and no,

58
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:18,270
I think I was ranked fourth in the world.

59
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,230
I fought Matt ragdolled him for basically
the whole first round through him

60
00:01:22,231 --> 00:01:23,220
around like a rag doll.

61
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,650
But he was just biding his time and wait.

62
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:30,720
And then they caught me with some knees
and damaged my nose and the ref or the,

63
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:31,381
yeah,

64
00:01:31,381 --> 00:01:33,750
the referee and the doctor stopped the
fight because back then it was very

65
00:01:33,751 --> 00:01:34,380
controversial.

66
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,550
They didn't want a guy with a crushed
nose or whatever and so they stopped the

67
00:01:38,551 --> 00:01:38,851
fight.

68
00:01:38,851 --> 00:01:42,390
But I realized at that point
he knew a lot more than I did.

69
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:43,220
He had.

70
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:45,870
That was an interesting fight
because I totally disagree with that.

71
00:01:45,871 --> 00:01:46,321
Stop it.

72
00:01:46,321 --> 00:01:46,491
You know,

73
00:01:46,491 --> 00:01:47,101
I was watching it.

74
00:01:47,101 --> 00:01:47,401
I was like,

75
00:01:47,401 --> 00:01:48,240
this is crazy.

76
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:50,380
How can you stop a
fight for a broken nose?

77
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:50,540
Well,

78
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,240
and it was,

79
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,120
I got headbutted.

80
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,340
I used to spar with a lot of pro boxers
and I got headbutted by a pro boxer and

81
00:01:56,341 --> 00:01:58,140
he separated the cartilage from the bone.

82
00:01:58,141 --> 00:01:59,700
So that gap is still there.

83
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,380
So that's what they felt.

84
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,670
My nose was bleeding a little bit,

85
00:02:02,671 --> 00:02:03,301
but so that's why,

86
00:02:03,301 --> 00:02:04,160
that's why they stopped it.

87
00:02:04,161 --> 00:02:04,300
So,

88
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,430
but broken noses,

89
00:02:05,431 --> 00:02:06,180
they're just,

90
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,550
it happens and it's not dangerous.

91
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:11,480
It's like maybe somebody saw
those movies where you like,

92
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:15,150
like remembering a movie guy would hit
the bottom of the guy's nose and drive

93
00:02:15,151 --> 00:02:17,820
the bone up and it was like
Mike Tyson talking about it,

94
00:02:17,821 --> 00:02:18,654
right?

95
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:19,320
He did.

96
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,550
He didn't like these puts it,

97
00:02:20,551 --> 00:02:21,100
puts it,

98
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,500
but the one up to the brain,

99
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,430
that might be the worst Mike
Tyson impression ever heard.

100
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,650
I'm going to let that go though.

101
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:28,171
I'm doing my best.

102
00:02:28,171 --> 00:02:30,000
Doing my best man back then.

103
00:02:30,001 --> 00:02:30,241
Yeah.

104
00:02:30,241 --> 00:02:31,440
Nobody really knew.

105
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,030
Like what was dangerous,

106
00:02:33,031 --> 00:02:33,960
what wasn't dangerous.

107
00:02:33,961 --> 00:02:34,441
It wasn't like,

108
00:02:34,441 --> 00:02:34,980
oh,

109
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,590
a body of fights that we could draw upon.

110
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,380
And I was doing televised debates
with politicians at the time.

111
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,370
We really to keep the sport legal in
the state that I was scheduled to fight

112
00:02:44,371 --> 00:02:44,491
him.

113
00:02:44,491 --> 00:02:47,340
So think of how stressful
it is to train for a fight,

114
00:02:47,341 --> 00:02:48,174
stay healthy,

115
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,440
try and pay your bills,

116
00:02:49,441 --> 00:02:50,460
do all the stuff you're doing.

117
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:54,330
And at the same time I'm
debating politicians in
that state who are trying to

118
00:02:54,331 --> 00:02:57,570
pass a bill to ban the sport that
I'm scheduled to fight in that state.

119
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,793
I'm panicking,

120
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,650
I'm freaking out.

121
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:03,190
So I do my homework and I'd get in
debates like represented the Boleyn from

122
00:03:03,191 --> 00:03:03,790
Illinois.

123
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:04,091
I got,

124
00:03:04,091 --> 00:03:05,500
by the time we got done with the debate,

125
00:03:05,501 --> 00:03:08,170
he goes all agree with Mr [inaudible].

126
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,910
He's obviously,

127
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:10,121
you know,

128
00:03:10,121 --> 00:03:14,320
I think that they expected to go into a
debate with a punch drunk box and by the

129
00:03:14,321 --> 00:03:15,490
time the debate was done,

130
00:03:15,491 --> 00:03:16,390
I crushed him.

131
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:17,081
And he's like,

132
00:03:17,081 --> 00:03:17,380
well,

133
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,270
maybe if we could just
do away with headbutts.

134
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:19,781
Yeah,

135
00:03:19,781 --> 00:03:20,110
no,

136
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,880
that was his rebuttal at the end of it.

137
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:22,990
Yeah.

138
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:23,823
I mean,

139
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:26,380
I see how they think and I see that.

140
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:27,220
Dot.

141
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,390
But I think today,

142
00:03:28,391 --> 00:03:29,290
even to this day,

143
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:30,790
I don't mind headbutts.

144
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:32,470
I don't either because you train for them.

145
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:33,341
If they're legal,

146
00:03:33,341 --> 00:03:34,300
that's what you're training for.

147
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:35,530
And it's a legit technique.

148
00:03:35,531 --> 00:03:38,020
Like why is it okay to slam
your elbow into someone's face?

149
00:03:38,021 --> 00:03:40,390
But it's not okay to slam your
forehand into someone's face.

150
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:40,690
Right.

151
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:41,950
And it's very effective.

152
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,820
If a guy's tying you up in the
guard and his head's right there,

153
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:49,030
you can do that and he can't
really do it back to you.

154
00:03:49,031 --> 00:03:49,720
It's an eye.

155
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,081
I mean,

156
00:03:50,081 --> 00:03:50,590
I,

157
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:54,310
I watched when I was in my first no
holds barred tournament in Chicago.

158
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:55,631
Oh God.

159
00:03:55,631 --> 00:03:57,250
I don't even remember
the name of it anymore.

160
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,113
It's been so long.

161
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:59,463
But um,

162
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:05,080
I saw a guy get headbutted 42 times in
the first round and he ended up winning

163
00:04:05,081 --> 00:04:05,914
with a triangle.

164
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,450
Why you ended up winning the fight?

165
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,150
It was Marcel loverage versus
this guy named Johnson.

166
00:04:10,151 --> 00:04:10,751
Mike Johnson,

167
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:15,220
I think his name was Marcel loverage
ends up losing after crushing him with

168
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:16,030
headbutts.

169
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:17,530
Mike Johnson's in the shower,

170
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,240
they're running cold water on him,

171
00:04:19,241 --> 00:04:22,210
trying to wake him back up and he
collapses and they have to throw in an

172
00:04:22,211 --> 00:04:22,990
alternate.

173
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:23,470
Wow.

174
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:24,030
But it was,

175
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:24,310
yeah.

176
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:24,940
Headbutts up,

177
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:25,900
obviously were legal then,

178
00:04:25,901 --> 00:04:26,530
so,

179
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:27,400
wow.

180
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,150
Yeah.

181
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:31,420
Headbutts like nat was marked the hammer.

182
00:04:31,421 --> 00:04:31,960
Coleman,

183
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,800
he's on the ground,

184
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:33,730
knees on the ground.

185
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:34,750
You see the head on the ground.

186
00:04:34,751 --> 00:04:35,220
Yeah.

187
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:35,510
But I mean,

188
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:37,630
you think about when
Coleman was in his prime,

189
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,410
he was all about headbutts and when he
fought Maurice and he took more ease

190
00:04:41,411 --> 00:04:42,040
down.

191
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,430
That was back in the days when
headbutts were legal and Maury Smith,

192
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,620
he defended against all
that doing all of this.

193
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:47,930
Yeah.

194
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:48,310
Yeah.

195
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:50,230
It's just another technique and,

196
00:04:50,231 --> 00:04:51,550
but without that technique,

197
00:04:51,551 --> 00:04:53,140
it's sort of like when I,

198
00:04:53,141 --> 00:04:53,974
um,

199
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,070
one of the ones when I realized that
taekwondo is very limited was when I

200
00:04:57,071 --> 00:05:00,250
started working out with kickboxers and
I started getting punched in the face

201
00:05:00,251 --> 00:05:00,730
and I was like,

202
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:01,210
oh,

203
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:02,043
no.

204
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,370
But if I learned,

205
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,533
I've learned this,

206
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,141
you know,

207
00:05:05,141 --> 00:05:08,140
thing that is only good if somebody
doesn't punch you in the face.

208
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:08,291
Like,

209
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:09,070
this is terrible,

210
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:09,440
but you know,

211
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,900
you were an open thinker obviously,

212
00:05:10,901 --> 00:05:15,340
and you realize that the
thing was with early MMA,

213
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:16,900
everybody was so tied to their technique.

214
00:05:16,901 --> 00:05:20,380
It's like being tied to a religion
and refusing to see something else.

215
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,493
It was a lot of that.

216
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,590
So guys who are taekwondo experts,

217
00:05:23,591 --> 00:05:24,580
wrestlers this,

218
00:05:24,581 --> 00:05:25,780
that they were so,

219
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:31,000
so attached to their art that they refuse
to learn anything else and they just

220
00:05:31,001 --> 00:05:31,930
die because of it.

221
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,460
They get crushed because of it.

222
00:05:33,461 --> 00:05:36,910
And I just early on when
these guys are dumb asses,

223
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:39,520
why wouldn't you want to know
how to do a lot of things?

224
00:05:39,521 --> 00:05:40,910
You've got to have a big tool box,

225
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:42,970
but there was always a
lot of pride in your art,

226
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,271
right?

227
00:05:43,271 --> 00:05:46,480
There was always a lot of
guys like wrestlers who were
only in the wrestling or

228
00:05:46,481 --> 00:05:47,261
kickboxers,

229
00:05:47,261 --> 00:05:49,060
the only in the mortality
just want to stand up.

230
00:05:49,061 --> 00:05:50,080
They didn't want to go to the ground.

231
00:05:50,081 --> 00:05:54,610
They just want to stand up and that
that just costs you in the long run.

232
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,010
Especially when you see
like a real complete,

233
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,070
like a guy

234
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,030
like mighty mouse,

235
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,820
like a guy like mighty mouse is at
the top of the heap trained by Matt,

236
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,451
Matt Hume,

237
00:06:02,451 --> 00:06:02,661
right?

238
00:06:02,661 --> 00:06:02,930
Yeah,

239
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:03,290
right,

240
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:04,010
exactly.

241
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:04,940
And he can do everything.

242
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:05,260
Yeah.

243
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,010
I mean it doesn't matter
if you're a wrestler,

244
00:06:07,011 --> 00:06:08,420
it doesn't matter if you're a kickboxer,

245
00:06:08,421 --> 00:06:09,230
you're fucked.

246
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,580
You're fucked everywhere with that guy.

247
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:14,300
And it's because he's got this just
incredibly well rounded skill sets.

248
00:06:14,301 --> 00:06:17,870
And I think the days of the
specialist I think are still,

249
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,280
they're still kind of here.

250
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,230
I'm surprised with that still the case.

251
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:21,540
Yeah.

252
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,510
There's a few guys that
can still pull it off,

253
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:28,670
but the guys that can pull it off or like
the Damien Maya's or the wonder boys.

254
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:28,930
Yeah.

255
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:29,621
Like wonder boy,

256
00:06:29,621 --> 00:06:32,000
it's just such an elite striker that is,

257
00:06:32,001 --> 00:06:33,470
if he can keep the fight standing,

258
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:37,010
he can kind of work a lot of guys and
because so many guys have not done karate

259
00:06:37,011 --> 00:06:37,844
and things like that.

260
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:38,630
He's,

261
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,460
he's like a Rubik's cube.

262
00:06:40,461 --> 00:06:41,200
They can't figure out.

263
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:41,840
Yeah.

264
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,410
Well he's long and that weird
sideways stance with that front leg.

265
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:45,920
Yeah.

266
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:50,330
Those guys who have a good front leg like
that karate style point fighting style

267
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,910
that they're used to blitzing
in with that good front leg.

268
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:54,950
Very hard to gauge that distance.

269
00:06:54,951 --> 00:06:55,820
So different.

270
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,270
Yeah.

271
00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:00,920
I think Woodley did the best job of
anybody in in fighting him and I think

272
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:05,810
that's like a roadmap for it because like
people booed Woodley and gave Woodley

273
00:07:05,811 --> 00:07:06,471
a lot of shit,

274
00:07:06,471 --> 00:07:08,960
but look Woodley's the one
who heard him in both fights.

275
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:09,410
Right.

276
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:11,000
And that that's the way
you got to fight that guy.

277
00:07:11,001 --> 00:07:14,570
You can't just charge after that guy
you had the criticisms of Woodley in my

278
00:07:14,571 --> 00:07:15,890
mind I think,

279
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:16,550
you know,

280
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:17,310
look,

281
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:21,050
it's a two man dance right
when we kept as title.

282
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:21,530
Yeah.

283
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:22,850
Ultimately that's all that matters.

284
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:23,810
You know what I mean?

285
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:24,081
Yeah.

286
00:07:24,081 --> 00:07:25,160
If I'm the champ,

287
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,420
I'm just trying to keep my title.

288
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:30,290
I'm doing enough to when I'm not
there to be the most exciting fight.

289
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,010
That was my mentality
because I knew once you get,

290
00:07:33,011 --> 00:07:35,930
cause I fought totally different
before I got to the EOC.

291
00:07:35,931 --> 00:07:39,440
I was just a psychopath and go out and
just go a hundred miles an hour until the

292
00:07:39,441 --> 00:07:40,160
guy was done.

293
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:40,910
Right.

294
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:41,870
But once you get in the UFC,

295
00:07:41,871 --> 00:07:42,860
then that's okay,

296
00:07:42,861 --> 00:07:44,150
we can cut you if you lose.

297
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:44,481
Right.

298
00:07:44,481 --> 00:07:44,781
It's like,

299
00:07:44,781 --> 00:07:45,111
okay,

300
00:07:45,111 --> 00:07:46,370
now I gotta change the way I fight.

301
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:46,521
Well,

302
00:07:46,521 --> 00:07:48,110
there's also the wind bonus.

303
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,370
I mean especially now,

304
00:07:49,371 --> 00:07:50,300
did they have the wind bonus?

305
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,140
Yeah,

306
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,000
that's tagged to me is a real issue.

307
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,460
I think a guy should be
paid what they get paid.

308
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:56,330
I think if you're,

309
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:57,290
you have a contract,

310
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:59,060
the contract for x amount of money,

311
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:01,190
if you have points on the paper
view that's on top of that,

312
00:08:01,191 --> 00:08:03,440
but the idea that your win or loss,

313
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:07,350
it could be in the hands of what we have
deemed completely incompetent judges.

314
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:08,180
I see it every week,

315
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,013
every week.

316
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:12,560
And you do a lot of commentary
yourself in these smaller shows.

317
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,221
I'd imagine.

318
00:08:13,221 --> 00:08:14,360
Sometimes it's even worse.

319
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,250
I've,

320
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:21,020
I mean we've gotten in trouble to the
point where we had people come to us and

321
00:08:21,021 --> 00:08:25,460
go look the promoters at different Oregon
that from different organizations when

322
00:08:25,461 --> 00:08:26,121
there was really,

323
00:08:26,121 --> 00:08:27,170
really bad decisions.

324
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:27,891
You know,

325
00:08:27,891 --> 00:08:29,900
when I was working with
Michael Chavela especially,

326
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:34,310
we were brutal on the athletic
commissions and we'd hear about it and go,

327
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,230
you guys need to back back off.

328
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,093
I've heard it too.

329
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,740
I heard it from athletic commissions too,

330
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,280
but I'd say go fuck yourself.

331
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:40,610
Yeah,

332
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:42,380
there's guys in there that
are fighting for their life.

333
00:08:42,381 --> 00:08:44,630
They literally trained for
months and months and some point,

334
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:48,740
someone who literally doesn't
even understand martial
arts is giving these guys

335
00:08:48,741 --> 00:08:49,574
a decision,

336
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,900
a loss or a win.

337
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:52,520
And that's 50% of their money.

338
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:53,990
And that's crazy.

339
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:58,020
I remember the first time I witnessed it
as far as a coach when my IFL team was

340
00:08:58,021 --> 00:08:58,900
fighting in taxes.

341
00:08:58,901 --> 00:08:59,401
We are fighting,

342
00:08:59,401 --> 00:09:02,970
I think bosses team and I looked
at the judges and all of them.

343
00:09:02,971 --> 00:09:04,040
One of them had a uh,

344
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:09,230
a bouffant hairdo and old lady and
then two old guys with white hair.

345
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,190
And I went back to the
locker room and I go,

346
00:09:11,191 --> 00:09:12,024
guys,

347
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:14,040
you can't let this go to the judges.

348
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:17,310
They're like one foot in the grave
and the other on a banana peel.

349
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,870
They know nothing about
what they're watching.

350
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,580
Like we are in deep shit.

351
00:09:20,581 --> 00:09:22,470
If we can't do it well it's,

352
00:09:22,471 --> 00:09:27,270
I think boxing is a very complicated art
and I think it's a very difficult thing

353
00:09:27,271 --> 00:09:28,590
to see to score,

354
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:32,850
but it's way more easy to
score then martial arts.

355
00:09:32,851 --> 00:09:33,570
Absolutely.

356
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:36,150
There's so much going on when
a fight goes to the ground.

357
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:36,511
I mean,

358
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,290
I have a friend who,

359
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:39,690
a judge who literally said to
me in the middle of a flight,

360
00:09:39,691 --> 00:09:42,030
one of the female judges
or referees rather,

361
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:42,540
uh,

362
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,170
judges,

363
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:44,910
one of female judges turned him and go,

364
00:09:44,911 --> 00:09:45,840
what is he doing?

365
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,370
Like what is he doing now?

366
00:09:47,371 --> 00:09:48,600
The guy was going for Kamora.

367
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:49,523
What is he doing?

368
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:50,853
What is he doing?

369
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:51,773
Adelaide.

370
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,001
Adelaide Berg,

371
00:09:53,001 --> 00:09:53,151
right?

372
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:53,690
Yeah.

373
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:53,990
We've,

374
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:55,000
we've heard you,

375
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:56,930
you talked about her
during one of the UFC.

376
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:00,600
I mean carmia joking around with his lady.

377
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:02,550
Very nice lady.

378
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:03,180
Yeah.

379
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:03,760
But like I said,

380
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,040
my mom's a really nice lady too.

381
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:06,610
I wouldn't want to judge when a judge,

382
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,250
but I said the Adelaide bird before,

383
00:10:08,251 --> 00:10:10,470
the pride in Las Vegas Lawler
was fighting in that one.

384
00:10:10,471 --> 00:10:11,220
Right.

385
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:11,730
And I thought,

386
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:12,720
I'm just going to ask.

387
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,180
And I walked up to her and I go,

388
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:15,001
excuse me,

389
00:10:15,001 --> 00:10:15,834
I'm new to the sport.

390
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,580
Could you tell me what
a triangle choke is?

391
00:10:17,581 --> 00:10:18,420
And she looked at me and went,

392
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:19,570
oh,

393
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:20,403
walked away.

394
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:23,671
Yeah,

395
00:10:23,671 --> 00:10:26,010
she's just [inaudible] maybe she's like,

396
00:10:26,011 --> 00:10:26,844
this is a trap.

397
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:31,950
I fucking pat villages to try and trap
guy with cauliflower ears asking me new

398
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:32,670
to this sport.

399
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,810
That's hilarious.

400
00:10:33,811 --> 00:10:36,540
He probably had like a transparent grin,

401
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:37,950
like you couldn't hold it back.

402
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:41,190
You know those Grenz just it's,

403
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,300
it's sad that this goes,

404
00:10:42,301 --> 00:10:42,970
it's awful.

405
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:44,640
They suspend fighters constantly,

406
00:10:44,641 --> 00:10:47,910
but one are they going to start
suspending referees and judges?

407
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,440
I think I've only seen it one time.

408
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:50,180
I agree.

409
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,020
I mean judges in,

410
00:10:51,021 --> 00:10:51,261
in,

411
00:10:51,261 --> 00:10:51,491
in,

412
00:10:51,491 --> 00:10:53,340
in for sure referees as well.

413
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,560
But I think that the,

414
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:58,710
the real thing that's so disappointing
to me is that there's a wealth of martial

415
00:10:58,711 --> 00:10:59,880
arts experts out there.

416
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:01,220
Like there's so many.

417
00:11:01,221 --> 00:11:01,590
Yeah,

418
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:05,230
there's so many good coaches
that would be great judges.

419
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:06,860
There's so many great x fighters.

420
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:10,440
There's so many people that are just
really well versed in martial arts.

421
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:11,520
They'd be able to tell.

422
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:14,640
And I also think three people
is a ridiculously small number.

423
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:15,771
I think for you you're,

424
00:11:15,771 --> 00:11:16,770
you're like five judges.

425
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:17,110
Yeah,

426
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,180
like five judges would.

427
00:11:18,181 --> 00:11:18,971
I think it makes sense.

428
00:11:18,971 --> 00:11:20,430
It was a lot of the shitty decisions.

429
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:23,220
That's a good idea because if
it's two and one and you like,

430
00:11:23,221 --> 00:11:24,780
there's sometimes you
get a split decision.

431
00:11:24,781 --> 00:11:25,021
You're like,

432
00:11:25,021 --> 00:11:26,100
what in the fuck?

433
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:30,300
Like one person saw this completely wrong
and the other two guys got it right.

434
00:11:30,301 --> 00:11:31,470
Thank God the other two guys were there.

435
00:11:31,471 --> 00:11:31,621
Well,

436
00:11:31,621 --> 00:11:32,880
if there's five people,

437
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,440
and this happens more than once,

438
00:11:34,441 --> 00:11:34,681
you say,

439
00:11:34,681 --> 00:11:34,891
okay,

440
00:11:34,891 --> 00:11:35,910
we've got a weak link here.

441
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,290
Let's get rid of this person.

442
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:37,770
Right?

443
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:38,603
Let's get rid of this person.

444
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:41,640
One judge will have it unanimous one
way and the other judges will have it

445
00:11:41,641 --> 00:11:42,420
unanimous the other.

446
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:42,800
It's like,

447
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:42,910
well,

448
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,660
how the heck they should be.

449
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:47,070
They should be held accountable.

450
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:47,361
They should.

451
00:11:47,361 --> 00:11:49,680
Someone should have to sit
down with them and say,

452
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,610
got to explain.

453
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:50,971
Like,

454
00:11:50,971 --> 00:11:51,661
what are you seeing?

455
00:11:51,661 --> 00:11:52,081
Like what's,

456
00:11:52,081 --> 00:11:53,130
let's watch the round.

457
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,220
Sit Down with me

458
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:56,830
and tell me how you think this guy
was getting the fuck beat out of him.

459
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,673
Was winning.

460
00:11:58,330 --> 00:11:58,751
I just,

461
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:01,140
it's criminal dude seen,

462
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:02,070
screwed up.

463
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,300
It's just,

464
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:03,580
it's,

465
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,360
it's heartbreaking.

466
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,193
It's heartbreaking.

467
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,900
It literally is like stealing
money from these kids,

468
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:08,360
you know?

469
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,193
I mean you're,

470
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,050
I just don't like the wind bonus,

471
00:12:11,051 --> 00:12:11,231
man.

472
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,160
I just think it's a bad,

473
00:12:12,161 --> 00:12:13,960
I don't think anybody
fights harder for it.

474
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:14,201
See.

475
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:14,860
And I don't even,

476
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,350
I don't even necessarily subscribe to,

477
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:18,071
you know,

478
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:20,290
fight of the night and knock out
of the night and stuff like that.

479
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:20,760
Yeah.

480
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,230
I don't,

481
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:21,520
I don't,

482
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:25,090
I think they just bring back the
yellow cards for stalling type stuff.

483
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:25,301
Right.

484
00:12:25,301 --> 00:12:26,440
But how pride did it,

485
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:26,920
right.

486
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,210
I think that's a great way to do things.

487
00:12:28,211 --> 00:12:29,260
And when pride did it,

488
00:12:29,261 --> 00:12:30,880
what did they take 10% of your purse?

489
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:31,961
I think so.

490
00:12:31,961 --> 00:12:32,410
And know,

491
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:33,640
and they would end up,

492
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:33,941
I mean,

493
00:12:33,941 --> 00:12:35,590
you'd get dqued eventually,

494
00:12:35,591 --> 00:12:35,740
right?

495
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:36,050
Yes.

496
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:37,390
We pull the red card and you're done.

497
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:37,741
Right.

498
00:12:37,741 --> 00:12:39,280
If it was more than one yellow card,

499
00:12:39,281 --> 00:12:40,010
you get DQ.

500
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:43,540
So they would give you a yellow card if
they thought that you were either doing

501
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:45,230
something illegal or if style,

502
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:46,750
age of stalling or whatever.

503
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:47,561
I mean,

504
00:12:47,561 --> 00:12:48,520
in college wrestling.

505
00:12:48,521 --> 00:12:50,110
And they knew that they
had to change things,

506
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:50,651
right?

507
00:12:50,651 --> 00:12:52,990
They had to speed up the action
and they started calling,

508
00:12:52,991 --> 00:12:56,410
stalling a lot faster in college wrestling
and it changed college wrestling guys

509
00:12:56,411 --> 00:12:56,990
get after it.

510
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:57,880
Now you know,

511
00:12:57,881 --> 00:13:01,360
my problem with it though is that there's
referees at separate fighters when

512
00:13:01,361 --> 00:13:03,400
they're working real
hard against the cage.

513
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:04,660
And I think again,

514
00:13:04,661 --> 00:13:06,130
it's guys who don't understand,

515
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,590
they don't understand how
difficult it says when you have,

516
00:13:08,591 --> 00:13:10,240
one guy was trying to
take the other guy down,

517
00:13:10,241 --> 00:13:13,690
the other guy is trying to defend their
landing shots in between trying to open

518
00:13:13,691 --> 00:13:15,340
up space and then the referee will say,

519
00:13:15,341 --> 00:13:16,170
keep working.

520
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,260
I'm going to separate you guys get,

521
00:13:17,261 --> 00:13:17,741
don't work.

522
00:13:17,741 --> 00:13:20,020
Like what the fuck are you watching it?

523
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,010
They're battling their battles.

524
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,990
They literally don't
understand the position.

525
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:23,650
Yeah.

526
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:24,070
And that's,

527
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,130
that's a giant problem.

528
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:28,160
And think about how many referees
have never truly trained right?

529
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,170
A lot.

530
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:29,830
A lot.

531
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:30,700
And if they did train,

532
00:13:30,701 --> 00:13:32,080
it was a long fucking time ago.

533
00:13:32,081 --> 00:13:34,450
A lot of the guys going in
there with big fat guts.

534
00:13:34,451 --> 00:13:37,390
And how many times have you called fights
and all the years you've been calling

535
00:13:37,391 --> 00:13:39,250
fights and been saying,

536
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:40,210
he's out,

537
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,073
he's out,

538
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:41,891
he's out,

539
00:13:41,891 --> 00:13:42,701
stopped the fight,

540
00:13:42,701 --> 00:13:43,321
stopped the fight,

541
00:13:43,321 --> 00:13:43,990
stopped the fight.

542
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:47,050
I wonder if you're so close to
it that you don't see it as well.

543
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:47,470
That's,

544
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,400
that's not an excuse.

545
00:13:48,401 --> 00:13:50,060
It's an excuse because you know,

546
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:52,750
you've trained for so many
years in martial arts,

547
00:13:52,751 --> 00:13:53,320
right.

548
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:53,651
You know,

549
00:13:53,651 --> 00:13:55,150
when somebody is unconscious from a choke,

550
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:55,691
you know,

551
00:13:55,691 --> 00:13:57,040
when a joints getting destroyed,

552
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:57,410
you know,

553
00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:58,690
you've been around it enough.

554
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:00,490
You've trained high level
enough where you see it,

555
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,570
you know,

556
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:04,360
you can see their stomach where
it's going in and out really hard.

557
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:04,751
You know,

558
00:14:04,751 --> 00:14:05,440
they're unconscious,

559
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,273
right?

560
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:09,340
Where referees look at somebody in their
eyes are wide open while his eyes are

561
00:14:09,341 --> 00:14:09,551
open.

562
00:14:09,551 --> 00:14:11,700
So we must be conscious Europe moron.

563
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,520
You don't understand,

564
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:12,711
right?

565
00:14:12,711 --> 00:14:13,160
Yeah.

566
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:13,870
Yeah.

567
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:14,980
What do you have thoughts on?

568
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,490
Um,

569
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:16,900
forcing tap outs?

570
00:14:16,901 --> 00:14:18,490
Like if a guy gets his arm broken,

571
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,320
like that's a controversial thing.

572
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,420
Like if stopping a fight,

573
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,160
what do you think about
Tim Silvia and Frank Mir?

574
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:25,023
Yeah.

575
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:28,780
Tim got his forearms crazy one because
in that one I kind of agree with her

576
00:14:28,781 --> 00:14:30,130
because it wasn't an elbow,

577
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,500
it was the middle of the arm.

578
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,520
Both forearm bones went at the same time.

579
00:14:33,521 --> 00:14:37,150
And so I didn't see that angle.

580
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:37,310
Right,

581
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:37,630
right.

582
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:42,210
Tim's back was to us in the
corner and herb stops it and I,

583
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:43,810
and Tim gets up and he's like,

584
00:14:43,811 --> 00:14:44,260
what the,

585
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:44,570
you know,

586
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:45,760
doing a great acting job,

587
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:46,390
right.

588
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,223
Tim,

589
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:47,501
you know,

590
00:14:47,501 --> 00:14:49,660
for whatever reason was
able to pull that off.

591
00:14:49,661 --> 00:14:49,871
I mean,

592
00:14:49,871 --> 00:14:50,800
that's not a pleasant feeling.

593
00:14:50,801 --> 00:14:51,350
Obviously.

594
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:51,650
Your,

595
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:56,650
your arms snap in height and Tim
gets up and he's like yelling at her.

596
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,160
I go in,

597
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,250
I start yelling at Herbert.

598
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:00,081
Herb's like Pat,

599
00:15:00,081 --> 00:15:01,010
I swear to God,

600
00:15:01,011 --> 00:15:02,210
his arm is broken.

601
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,470
He's pleased.

602
00:15:03,471 --> 00:15:05,930
And then I see the replay on
the big screen and I got her,

603
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:06,470
well,

604
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:10,850
I remember the crowd was booing and then
we played the replay back and I'm like,

605
00:15:10,851 --> 00:15:11,330
watch it,

606
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:12,170
watch it right here.

607
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:12,950
Slashing here.

608
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:13,340
But he'd go,

609
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,860
oh yeah.

610
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,711
And then I told him,

611
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:18,440
I go wave to the crowd when we walk
out of the cage with your broken arm.

612
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,740
So Tim goes like,

613
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,190
ah.

614
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:22,941
And then we got back,

615
00:15:22,941 --> 00:15:25,700
we got backstage and the
doctor looked at it and I go,

616
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:26,781
how bad is that?

617
00:15:26,781 --> 00:15:27,350
And he goes,

618
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:27,530
oh,

619
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:28,363
fucking arts.

620
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:28,740
Yes.

621
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:29,480
This hurts.

622
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,060
Yeah.

623
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:30,200
Yeah.

624
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:30,920
It was bad.

625
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,730
So the doctor that did the doctor then,

626
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:34,220
the doctor that did it was a good,

627
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:35,091
good friend of mine,

628
00:15:35,091 --> 00:15:38,060
orthopedic Guy who I
trained for many years.

629
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:42,500
He was a bull rider at one time and then
became an orthopedic surgeon and then

630
00:15:42,501 --> 00:15:43,970
trained with me and kickboxing.

631
00:15:43,971 --> 00:15:44,540
Right.

632
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,081
Tough guy.

633
00:15:45,081 --> 00:15:45,410
Tough,

634
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:45,710
tough,

635
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:47,210
tough dude from Texas with imagine.

636
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:47,991
And he goes,

637
00:15:47,991 --> 00:15:52,991
I've never had to order plates for a
tibia bone to replace to put some of these

638
00:15:55,551 --> 00:15:56,540
foreign bones back together.

639
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:56,840
He goes,

640
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,640
there's big as the normal humans Tibia.

641
00:15:58,910 --> 00:15:59,350
Oh yeah.

642
00:15:59,350 --> 00:15:59,651
Tim's,

643
00:15:59,651 --> 00:16:00,120
it just,

644
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:00,500
yeah,

645
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:00,800
it was,

646
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,850
his bones were massive.

647
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,181
He goes,

648
00:16:02,181 --> 00:16:03,014
they don't even make,

649
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,370
I had to use Tibia plates.

650
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:05,260
Wow.

651
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,093
Yeah.

652
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,310
Healed 100%.

653
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:08,480
Yeah.

654
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,260
Yeah.

655
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,370
Cause there's a long time though,

656
00:16:10,371 --> 00:16:10,930
right?

657
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:11,330
Like Dad,

658
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:12,600
dad really struggled with that.

659
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:13,100
That was,

660
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:16,400
I remember him saying thank you
to herb dean for saving as career.

661
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,030
Yeah.

662
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:17,451
Because,

663
00:16:17,451 --> 00:16:18,150
uh,

664
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:18,500
you know,

665
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,150
if he let him go on and that,

666
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,890
that thing got taken down.

667
00:16:21,891 --> 00:16:23,140
Here it goes.

668
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,040
Once it breaks through the skin,

669
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:25,460
right.

670
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,420
That becomes a giant issue for infections.

671
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:28,341
All kinds of,

672
00:16:28,341 --> 00:16:29,174
here it is right here.

673
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,260
Jamie pulled it up.

674
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:31,461
Frank Mir.

675
00:16:31,461 --> 00:16:33,920
That mother fucker has broken more arms.

676
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,300
They're not showing it right here.

677
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:35,660
Oh,

678
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,790
it says was right on the
cup is that may play.

679
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:38,743
Yeah,

680
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,260
that's a,

681
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,450
that's another thing about metal cups.

682
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:43,130
That's a weird little loophole.

683
00:16:43,131 --> 00:16:43,640
Here it is.

684
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,780
That's a weird angle to look at.

685
00:16:44,781 --> 00:16:45,614
That

686
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:47,810
Daddy,

687
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:48,860
that's a weird angle.

688
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,753
That was ugly.

689
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:50,360
It was ugly.

690
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,260
Those metal cups,

691
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:51,561
man,

692
00:16:51,561 --> 00:16:52,390
that's a weird,

693
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:52,820
uh,

694
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,140
still loophole.

695
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:55,280
Like you could still wear those,

696
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,200
those tie cops steal.

697
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:58,250
You should be able to,

698
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,550
but you're kicking metal and
it's also a crazy fulcrum.

699
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,160
If you got a guy in an arm bar that's,

700
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:04,730
you got to fucking metal rod there.

701
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,570
I like it though.

702
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:05,980
I like,

703
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:06,813
I'm sure you do.

704
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:12,860
But the thing with the old timers that
taught me and k one and Muay Thai was you

705
00:17:12,861 --> 00:17:16,910
take those metal cups and you take a
sheet metal screws from the inside out and

706
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:17,720
you screw this,

707
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,910
put the sheet metal screws through
and then back them back out.

708
00:17:19,911 --> 00:17:22,040
So there's raised edges everywhere on it,

709
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:22,933
right?

710
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,781
So you wear that.

711
00:17:23,781 --> 00:17:24,180
So if,

712
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:27,170
if they need you or kick you in the groin
at shreds their meetup on their knee

713
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:27,860
or their foot.

714
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:28,670
Right.

715
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:32,180
So that's what the old tie fighters
would do is that's the way they would do

716
00:17:32,181 --> 00:17:32,571
their cups.

717
00:17:32,571 --> 00:17:33,920
So that's how I started doing it.

718
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,690
So if they're going to low blow me,

719
00:17:35,691 --> 00:17:37,310
they're going to shred
the fricking leg up.

720
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:41,090
The problem with that is it also works
if you get a guy and you mount them and

721
00:17:41,091 --> 00:17:42,650
you drive that thing into his sternum,

722
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:45,320
then you've got like you're
shoving into his sternum.

723
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,580
That seems like a weapon.

724
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:47,930
It seems a little bit,

725
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:50,190
it seems a little bit
like little cheating.

726
00:17:50,191 --> 00:17:50,660
We,

727
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,001
yeah,

728
00:17:51,001 --> 00:17:51,600
I,

729
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,880
there was a couple of other guys
that did that back in the day,

730
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:57,570
especially the Chicago circuit because
I was fighting kickboxing and in Chicago

731
00:17:57,571 --> 00:17:58,560
a lot was Chicago,

732
00:17:58,561 --> 00:18:00,120
like a rougher circuit dude.

733
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:00,570
It was,

734
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:01,170
uh,

735
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:04,740
they would do k one rules Muay Thai
and then I started in the PKC style

736
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,390
originally and I hated it because it was,

737
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:06,901
you know,

738
00:18:06,901 --> 00:18:07,800
the light tree,

739
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,450
like the dragsters,

740
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:14,480
the old PKC was you get one kick
in one light lights like PKA.

741
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:16,440
Yeah,

742
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:16,651
yeah.

743
00:18:16,651 --> 00:18:18,870
Basically it was all the same
shit right above the waist.

744
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:19,490
Kickboxing.

745
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:19,990
Yeah.

746
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,750
With the Silk Pants and that shit.

747
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:22,670
God,

748
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:24,270
it was brutal foam boots on.

749
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:25,110
So when I started,

750
00:18:25,111 --> 00:18:25,950
I wasn't flexible.

751
00:18:25,951 --> 00:18:26,101
Right.

752
00:18:26,101 --> 00:18:28,800
That was a wrestler who
had some boxing experience.

753
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:31,740
And the reason they did that was so
boxers wouldn't come in and destroy

754
00:18:31,741 --> 00:18:32,540
everybody.

755
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:32,910
Right.

756
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:35,220
So the karate guys could
survive and do pretty well.

757
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:39,840
So that just having to get the
allotted eight kicks per round.

758
00:18:39,841 --> 00:18:41,820
I hated it because it was
all kick above the waist.

759
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:42,960
I wasn't that flexible.

760
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,430
I was pretty shitty.

761
00:18:44,431 --> 00:18:45,390
It kicks when I,

762
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:46,261
when I first started.

763
00:18:46,261 --> 00:18:46,830
Right.

764
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:47,910
So it was just a waste of time.

765
00:18:47,911 --> 00:18:51,330
And then I ran into the movie tie
thing and the k one rules fights,

766
00:18:51,331 --> 00:18:51,660
and I went,

767
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,381
this is my thing.

768
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:53,400
I can kick them in the legs.

769
00:18:53,401 --> 00:18:54,234
Thank God.

770
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:54,571
Well,

771
00:18:54,571 --> 00:18:56,310
I remember the first time
we got kicked in the leg,

772
00:18:56,311 --> 00:18:56,760
I was like,

773
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:56,971
oh,

774
00:18:56,971 --> 00:18:58,380
this is such a game changer.

775
00:18:58,410 --> 00:18:59,940
Because in taekwondo it was like,

776
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:00,803
it was illegal.

777
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,320
It was illegal to kick below the waist
and it was legal to punch in the face.

778
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,720
So it was great for learning
dexterity of the legs.

779
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:10,860
But the f the moment I started training
with Thai guys and I got kicked once,

780
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,431
just once,

781
00:19:11,431 --> 00:19:11,830
I want,

782
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:12,663
oh,

783
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:14,350
should do this,

784
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:16,470
this should be the
thing that's so painful.

785
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,311
It's so painful.

786
00:19:17,311 --> 00:19:18,210
It's weird.

787
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,290
It's not just painful.

788
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:20,670
It's like your leg goes dead.

789
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,140
Yeah.

790
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:21,470
It's,

791
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:23,190
it's this weird feeling.

792
00:19:23,191 --> 00:19:23,520
You're like,

793
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,001
Oh,

794
00:19:24,001 --> 00:19:24,834
Christ,

795
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,640
the SOA effective.

796
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:26,970
Yeah.

797
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:30,210
And also that you could do
it from such a close range.

798
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:33,020
They can be in the clinch and
blast somebody in the leg and her.

799
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:33,690
Right.

800
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:38,690
So the worst experience of my life
sparring was Arthur Murray on a Souza.

801
00:19:38,971 --> 00:19:43,320
He was the guy in the old ibcs in
Brazil that laid Vander Lee silver's.

802
00:19:43,321 --> 00:19:46,380
I wide open and all the meat
was hanging down past his eye.

803
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,760
That was Arthur Mariana Sousa.

804
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:48,990
And they remembered that guy,

805
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:49,681
great striker,

806
00:19:49,681 --> 00:19:52,620
trained in Holland for a lot of years and
he would come up with Omri Pritesh and

807
00:19:52,621 --> 00:19:53,454
live with me.

808
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:56,970
When Tash was the elite guy
on the planet grappling,

809
00:19:56,971 --> 00:19:57,510
right?

810
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:00,990
So we had the best of both worlds where
the wicked striker and one of the best

811
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:03,510
grapplers in the world and he'd come
up and then we'd just train hard,

812
00:20:03,511 --> 00:20:04,170
right?

813
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:04,891
For six,

814
00:20:04,891 --> 00:20:05,850
eight weeks at a time.

815
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:09,280
And Arthur started low
kicking the shit on there.

816
00:20:09,281 --> 00:20:10,260
Everybody at my gym,

817
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,780
we weren't great Muay
Thai guys at that time,

818
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:13,730
but it,

819
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:16,170
the experience of watching he,

820
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,133
he started,

821
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:17,980
that's the thing,

822
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,470
he started getting to the back leg,

823
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:20,100
right?

824
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:20,340
Oh,

825
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,400
you can throw the cross and
step outside and come back and,

826
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:25,710
and just tap me on the same spot over
and over on your back leg and you're

827
00:20:25,711 --> 00:20:28,110
always taking your weight
off that leg off the cross.

828
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:29,430
Your weight goes on it.

829
00:20:29,431 --> 00:20:32,380
Then it comes back off of it as you're
stepping right when the kick hit.

830
00:20:32,381 --> 00:20:33,121
So it's like Jello,

831
00:20:33,121 --> 00:20:33,954
your clubs and yellow.

832
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,230
I'll just cut right to the
femur bone every time he,

833
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:42,210
he kicked me like three times in a row
in the exact same spot and that I went

834
00:20:42,211 --> 00:20:43,044
and went

835
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,241
and he goes,

836
00:20:45,241 --> 00:20:45,780
patch,

837
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,070
you know with a Brazilian accent.

838
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:47,291
He's like,

839
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:47,561
patch,

840
00:20:47,561 --> 00:20:47,950
I know,

841
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:48,251
I know.

842
00:20:48,251 --> 00:20:49,480
Kick you in that leg anymore.

843
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:49,811
And I go,

844
00:20:49,811 --> 00:20:50,231
no dude,

845
00:20:50,231 --> 00:20:51,610
I need to learn the hard way.

846
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,701
I need to learn the hard way.

847
00:20:52,701 --> 00:20:52,890
I said,

848
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:53,141
he's like,

849
00:20:53,141 --> 00:20:53,590
all right,

850
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:57,140
cross low kick fall down balling.

851
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,710
He had Jens Pulver jumping like this,

852
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,573
like a monkey.

853
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,120
He was so afraid of his low kicks and
then you fucked for days afterwards.

854
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:04,421
Yeah.

855
00:21:04,421 --> 00:21:05,254
You don't want to get chicken

856
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:05,810
Gabe.

857
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:06,810
When you try to train,

858
00:21:06,811 --> 00:21:07,740
you're all jacked up.

859
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:08,701
Yeah,

860
00:21:08,701 --> 00:21:09,190
it's a,

861
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:11,360
it's an amazing skill that,

862
00:21:11,361 --> 00:21:14,100
that the ties really figured
out how to do it right.

863
00:21:14,101 --> 00:21:15,670
And me Kill Catia and obviously had it,

864
00:21:15,671 --> 00:21:16,710
a lot of martial arts had it,

865
00:21:16,711 --> 00:21:17,610
but man,

866
00:21:17,611 --> 00:21:19,200
the ties figured it out.

867
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:19,930
Yeah.

868
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:23,820
It's kind of crazy when you think
about this one small island.

869
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,520
It's one small country and they,

870
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:30,930
because of gambling and because they had
all those fights and they just figured

871
00:21:30,931 --> 00:21:32,700
out a totally different
method of training,

872
00:21:32,701 --> 00:21:34,040
a totally different method of fighting.

873
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:34,280
Yeah.

874
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:34,580
Yeah.

875
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,450
Pretty impressive.

876
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:38,810
What do you think about the history
of of Thai fighting between the,

877
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:41,940
the Laotians on the ties
during times of peace,

878
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,900
the soldiers would fight each
other and all that sort of stuff.

879
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:47,810
Just a bunch of scary people and
they're the nicest people in the world.

880
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,621
The nicest people.

881
00:21:48,621 --> 00:21:51,140
You couldn't meet any nicer people
who will completely requeue.

882
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:52,240
It's so weird because like

883
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,150
when you meet ties,

884
00:21:53,151 --> 00:21:54,410
especially even tie fighters,

885
00:21:54,411 --> 00:21:55,730
they're so friendly.

886
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,550
They're so friendly and humble and warm.

887
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,940
And then when you watch him fight like

888
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:00,940
Jesus,

889
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,770
it's kind of crazy.

890
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:02,951
Yeah.

891
00:22:02,951 --> 00:22:03,161
My,

892
00:22:03,161 --> 00:22:03,910
so my,

893
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:04,721
my Muay Thai coach,

894
00:22:04,721 --> 00:22:05,850
a guy named long longly,

895
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,000
his last name was not long way.

896
00:22:07,001 --> 00:22:08,860
It was a lot longer than that.

897
00:22:08,861 --> 00:22:09,900
But he was a stadium champion,

898
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:10,631
lived in Peoria,

899
00:22:10,631 --> 00:22:15,631
Illinois and the ghetto and he had a
little shitty basement with type with like

900
00:22:16,511 --> 00:22:16,970
a,

901
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:17,380
uh,

902
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:19,060
banana bags and all that sort of stuff.

903
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,710
And I found the amount of sheer luck.

904
00:22:20,711 --> 00:22:21,700
Somebody said,

905
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,280
there's this guy in Peoria
that was a stadium champion.

906
00:22:24,281 --> 00:22:25,114
He's the guy.

907
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:29,410
So I went to see him and he taught me
how to clinch do clench work and he was

908
00:22:29,411 --> 00:22:30,910
140 pounds maybe.

909
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:34,060
And he put you in the clench all the
years of wrestling and everything else.

910
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:34,894
Didn't matter.

911
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:39,500
I mean I felt like a dog in a lake
with a raccoon hanging on my head.

912
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:40,020
That's a,

913
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:40,290
to me

914
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:43,680
one thing that people don't realize
that there are real fans of the sport is

915
00:22:43,681 --> 00:22:45,810
that Moitai is a lot about grappling.

916
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,080
Yeah.

917
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,490
It's a lot about that clinch work.

918
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:51,690
And that's one of the things that I
really like lion fight above a lot of the

919
00:22:51,691 --> 00:22:55,200
other kickboxing organizations is that
they let those guys work in the clinch

920
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,910
and elbows in the clinch.

921
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:57,973
And they say it's a,

922
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:58,471
again,

923
00:22:58,471 --> 00:22:59,820
like we were saying about headbutts,

924
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,490
these elements are very effective,

925
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:03,810
so why remove them?

926
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:09,480
It's the what's tolerable
to the politicians and the
public and all the other

927
00:23:09,481 --> 00:23:10,314
guard

928
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:10,930
clinch.

929
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:12,100
Everything should be there,

930
00:23:12,101 --> 00:23:12,670
I think.

931
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:13,810
I think everything should be there.

932
00:23:13,811 --> 00:23:16,360
I think the real issue is that the cage,

933
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,590
the real issue is the cage.

934
00:23:17,591 --> 00:23:18,191
My opinion,

935
00:23:18,191 --> 00:23:20,530
because the cage presents
this artificial barrier,

936
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:20,771
right?

937
00:23:20,771 --> 00:23:21,600
I mean I've been,

938
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,920
I'm beating a dead horse here because
I've been saying they should find a

939
00:23:23,921 --> 00:23:24,790
basketball courts.

940
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:25,241
I'm like,

941
00:23:25,241 --> 00:23:27,410
if you're going to have a basketball
game and a basketball court,

942
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,270
we serve a striker,

943
00:23:29,271 --> 00:23:29,720
right?

944
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,500
Fuck yeah.

945
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,420
The rustlers are able to
get you against the cage.

946
00:23:32,421 --> 00:23:33,710
You Yank your legs out
from underneath you.

947
00:23:33,711 --> 00:23:34,610
I beat the shit out of you.

948
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,210
It is,

949
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:37,070
it is an advantage for the wrestlers.

950
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:40,070
It's also an advantage for the wrestlers
and that a guy's not going to be able

951
00:23:40,071 --> 00:23:42,710
to put his back up against the
cage and get back up again.

952
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:43,693
You know,

953
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,500
Rambler has you down the center.

954
00:23:45,501 --> 00:23:46,010
You're going to have to

955
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:47,240
earn that stand up.

956
00:23:47,241 --> 00:23:50,540
You're gonna have to actually either
reverse the position or figure out a real

957
00:23:50,541 --> 00:23:54,620
escape because so many guys are so good
at wall walking and there's so many,

958
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:59,180
and they're also good at defending a
submission by keeping one side pressed up

959
00:23:59,181 --> 00:24:00,890
against the cage and
then attend tender back.

960
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:01,790
Yeah,

961
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:01,980
right.

962
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:05,540
I think that it's an artificial
environment like the cage and it's also,

963
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,430
it's hard to see,

964
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:08,690
like if you're in the audience,

965
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:09,411
I mean it's,

966
00:24:09,411 --> 00:24:11,690
it's actually better
sometimes to be home watching.

967
00:24:11,691 --> 00:24:12,020
I like it.

968
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,700
I like the boxing rings for fights.

969
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:14,270
I mean,

970
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:16,070
they go through the ropes
now and then whatever.

971
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:17,023
Right.

972
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:20,000
But it's a lot better for
people at home watching the,

973
00:24:20,001 --> 00:24:20,900
and for the live crowd,

974
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:22,460
there's just not that cage.

975
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:25,760
I agree with that focus
problem and cameras.

976
00:24:25,761 --> 00:24:26,120
Right.

977
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:26,481
I agree.

978
00:24:26,481 --> 00:24:30,260
I think Bella tour actually nailed it
with their kickboxing ring because they

979
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:32,930
put this big circle around
it so you can't fall through.

980
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:36,380
Like remember when Bernard Hopkins
fought Joe Smith and his last fight,

981
00:24:36,381 --> 00:24:38,720
he went through the ropes and
landed on his fucking head.

982
00:24:38,721 --> 00:24:39,050
Yeah.

983
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:39,291
I mean,

984
00:24:39,291 --> 00:24:41,900
this is a terrible way
for a legend to go out,

985
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:43,050
like to be,

986
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:43,411
this is,

987
00:24:43,411 --> 00:24:47,000
it's the rope ropes were loose and he
gets clipped while he was already going

988
00:24:47,001 --> 00:24:47,330
down.

989
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:48,470
You just goes right through the hill.

990
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:48,920
Yeah.

991
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:52,390
That's ridiculous that he could fall
four feet and land on his fucking head.

992
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:55,700
That was the fight where Bernard was
talking tons of shit before the fight.

993
00:24:55,701 --> 00:24:56,120
Right.

994
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,020
Was he talking lot of Shit?

995
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:58,500
He was talking a lot of shows.

996
00:24:58,510 --> 00:24:59,300
His last fight,

997
00:24:59,300 --> 00:24:59,700
you know,

998
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,490
and probably realized,

999
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,970
I mean Bernard Hopkins was getting his
ass kicked by Antwan Eccles who trained

1000
00:25:04,971 --> 00:25:07,280
at pinions boxing gym
in Iowa where I trained.

1001
00:25:07,281 --> 00:25:08,114
Right.

1002
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:09,380
And one was scary dude.

1003
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:09,981
He was scary.

1004
00:25:09,981 --> 00:25:10,310
He got,

1005
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:14,210
he got side sidetracked and
derailed by horrible management.

1006
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,220
They really screwed his,

1007
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,031
his career up.

1008
00:25:17,031 --> 00:25:21,860
But he was the scariest boxer that I
have ever seen and been in the gym with.

1009
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,221
I mean,

1010
00:25:22,221 --> 00:25:22,880
that guy would,

1011
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:27,080
he's looking like he's punching at half
speed and just crushing people was 16

1012
00:25:27,081 --> 00:25:29,020
ounce sparring gloves on destroying Pete.

1013
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,460
I remember Anton Antwan went down to,

1014
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,080
it was South America,

1015
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,700
Ecuador or wherever the hell it was.

1016
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:36,800
That was when,

1017
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:37,460
uh,

1018
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:38,750
Norris was fighting

1019
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,300
Simon Brown,

1020
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:42,343
Terri,

1021
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:43,130
Terri,

1022
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:43,963
Terri Norris,

1023
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,310
the smaller one,

1024
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:46,551
right?

1025
00:25:46,551 --> 00:25:46,761
Yeah.

1026
00:25:46,761 --> 00:25:47,390
To turn,

1027
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:47,990
uh,

1028
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:52,640
Michael Nunn was defending his title
there and Antwan I'll has got on the card

1029
00:25:52,641 --> 00:25:55,580
because Michael Nunn was the pound
for pound best fighter in the world.

1030
00:25:55,581 --> 00:25:56,330
He was out of Davenport.

1031
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:57,400
Iowa also were right.

1032
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:00,920
So they were doing about your sparring
and they were training down there,

1033
00:26:00,921 --> 00:26:02,330
getting used to the altitude and they,

1034
00:26:02,331 --> 00:26:05,300
Antwan one walked into the gym and he
started sparring with three time world

1035
00:26:05,301 --> 00:26:06,890
champions and beating the
shit out of all of them.

1036
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:08,443
And they go,

1037
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,021
dude,

1038
00:26:09,021 --> 00:26:10,100
you need to back off.

1039
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:10,670
You need to,

1040
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:11,540
you need to stop this.

1041
00:26:11,541 --> 00:26:13,550
And it's a month out from the
fight and he doesn't care.

1042
00:26:13,551 --> 00:26:15,890
He's knocking the shit out of all
these three time world champs.

1043
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:16,761
And they'd go,

1044
00:26:16,761 --> 00:26:19,880
you're basically what Antoinne
said to all of them was,

1045
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:21,710
if you guys can't handle it,

1046
00:26:21,711 --> 00:26:22,544
stay out of my running.

1047
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:25,850
Like I don't care who you
are or what your titles are.

1048
00:26:25,851 --> 00:26:26,684
I'm going to rescue,

1049
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,250
so toughen up.

1050
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:29,570
I own the ring now.

1051
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,080
Right.

1052
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:30,950
That's how good he was.

1053
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,890
What do you think about that
kind of sparring though?

1054
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,113
I think it's great.

1055
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:36,770
Do you think it's great to just go to war?

1056
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,600
I just,

1057
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:37,941
you know,

1058
00:26:37,941 --> 00:26:38,251
you can,

1059
00:26:38,251 --> 00:26:38,571
you know,

1060
00:26:38,571 --> 00:26:39,770
there has to be a limit obviously,

1061
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:41,510
because the ties don't
do it like that at all.

1062
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,050
Well,

1063
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:42,711
here's the thing though.

1064
00:26:42,711 --> 00:26:44,250
That's because the low kicks and knees,

1065
00:26:44,251 --> 00:26:44,941
the elbows,

1066
00:26:44,941 --> 00:26:45,750
all that sort of stuff.

1067
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:46,920
But it's also because they fight a lot,

1068
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:47,340
right?

1069
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:47,581
Yeah.

1070
00:26:47,581 --> 00:26:48,414
They're fighting every week,

1071
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:48,960
you know,

1072
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,441
so that,

1073
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:49,891
that's,

1074
00:26:49,891 --> 00:26:50,101
that's,

1075
00:26:50,101 --> 00:26:50,700
you're smart.

1076
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,481
But you know,

1077
00:26:51,481 --> 00:26:53,100
the thing is you can't,

1078
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:54,480
and I say it a million times,

1079
00:26:54,481 --> 00:26:55,111
I've said it for years.

1080
00:26:55,111 --> 00:26:58,920
You can't become a race car driver by
going down the highway at 55 he's just

1081
00:26:58,921 --> 00:26:59,850
don't have the reaction time.

1082
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:00,970
You're not used to that.

1083
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,760
See Highspeed that high endurance,

1084
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,110
everything else that goes on,

1085
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:07,680
you have to get used to that and
everything slows down eventually.

1086
00:27:07,681 --> 00:27:07,891
Right.

1087
00:27:07,891 --> 00:27:09,270
With experience and time,

1088
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:10,530
things slow down for you.

1089
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,500
I can remember when I first
started fighting kickboxing
and everything was like

1090
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:16,380
a tunnel this big and all I
could hear was me breathing.

1091
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:17,563
Right,

1092
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,673
right.

1093
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:19,683
Anything else.

1094
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,540
But then later on in my career,

1095
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:22,861
you know,

1096
00:27:22,861 --> 00:27:25,120
you'd see punches come at
you and you'd move this slow,

1097
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:26,663
but it was actually,

1098
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:27,810
you know what I mean?

1099
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:28,410
So it just,

1100
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:30,990
it happens with time and
you've experienced that
with everything you've done,

1101
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:31,610
right?

1102
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:35,400
We come martial arts more accustomed
to it and then you become more relaxed.

1103
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:40,580
But I wonder like is there a way to keep
the speed but at least take something

1104
00:27:41,011 --> 00:27:41,844
off the shots.

1105
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:45,410
That's the thing is where you put
the shin pads on the head gear,

1106
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,560
the 16 ounce gloves,

1107
00:27:46,561 --> 00:27:47,460
you'd go at high speed,

1108
00:27:47,461 --> 00:27:48,121
you go hard,

1109
00:27:48,121 --> 00:27:49,170
you hit takedowns hard,

1110
00:27:49,171 --> 00:27:50,004
all that sort of stuff,

1111
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,990
you know a couple of times a week.

1112
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:52,361
But you,

1113
00:27:52,361 --> 00:27:52,591
you know,

1114
00:27:52,591 --> 00:27:54,360
you can't take that kind
of punishment constantly.

1115
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,800
But you know,

1116
00:27:55,801 --> 00:27:57,080
mornings would be conditioning,

1117
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:57,901
strength stuff,

1118
00:27:57,901 --> 00:27:58,471
technique,

1119
00:27:58,471 --> 00:27:59,131
all that sort of stuff.

1120
00:27:59,131 --> 00:27:59,970
Then the nighttime was,

1121
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:00,510
you know,

1122
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:01,291
more high speed,

1123
00:28:01,291 --> 00:28:02,124
hard takedowns.

1124
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:04,380
And as a coach I had to look and go,

1125
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:04,770
all right,

1126
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:05,880
tonight's takedowns.

1127
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,650
But if I saw people getting tired,

1128
00:28:07,651 --> 00:28:08,670
fatigued and sloppy,

1129
00:28:08,671 --> 00:28:10,080
I knew an injury was about to happen.

1130
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:10,681
Okay,

1131
00:28:10,681 --> 00:28:12,270
let's go to the ground
now getting the guard,

1132
00:28:12,271 --> 00:28:13,090
lets go from there.

1133
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:13,470
Let's do,

1134
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:13,720
you know,

1135
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,030
do some ground and pound drills,

1136
00:28:15,031 --> 00:28:15,864
this and that.

1137
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:16,681
So I think,

1138
00:28:16,681 --> 00:28:16,960
you know,

1139
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,790
it was,

1140
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:21,060
it's important to go high speed until
you start seeing mistakes happen because

1141
00:28:21,061 --> 00:28:22,320
of sloppiness fatigue.

1142
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:23,620
That's when people get hurt.

1143
00:28:23,621 --> 00:28:25,710
And then you've got to pull
the reigns back on everybody.

1144
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,270
When you were running your gym,

1145
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:30,120
the military fighting systems was the gym.

1146
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,740
I mean you guys were the kings.

1147
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:33,600
You got to think about
who came out at your gym.

1148
00:28:33,601 --> 00:28:34,351
Matt Hughes,

1149
00:28:34,351 --> 00:28:35,280
Robbie Lawler,

1150
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:37,350
I mean Jens Pulver,

1151
00:28:37,351 --> 00:28:38,430
Tim Silvia,

1152
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:41,190
and then a host of other
killers that people just forgot.

1153
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:41,520
You know,

1154
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,100
we had a lot of people obviously
that would come and train with us.

1155
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:44,963
Rich Franklin,

1156
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:46,303
um,

1157
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:49,200
Dave [inaudible] who was
85 pound champ for a while.

1158
00:28:49,201 --> 00:28:50,034
He was,

1159
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:52,050
he was one of the best martial
artists I've ever seen.

1160
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:53,520
People don't even know about it.

1161
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:56,700
The guy was incredible trained with
Greg Nelson for a good portion of his

1162
00:28:56,701 --> 00:28:57,031
career,

1163
00:28:57,031 --> 00:28:57,481
obviously,

1164
00:28:57,481 --> 00:29:02,481
but I think we had 92 people made it to
televise careers and I think 30 or so I

1165
00:29:02,911 --> 00:29:03,870
made it to the UFC.

1166
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:04,831
I was pretty impressed.

1167
00:29:04,831 --> 00:29:05,221
So it's,

1168
00:29:05,221 --> 00:29:05,551
you know,

1169
00:29:05,551 --> 00:29:06,750
when I added it all up,

1170
00:29:06,751 --> 00:29:10,640
somebody asked me to do that and I added
it all up and I went through all the,

1171
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:14,640
the televised cards and I remembered
it was I think 92 people and I thought,

1172
00:29:14,641 --> 00:29:16,500
you know that it's pretty impressive.

1173
00:29:16,501 --> 00:29:17,520
We had a lot of killers.

1174
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:18,450
We had a lot of killers.

1175
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:19,261
Yeah.

1176
00:29:19,261 --> 00:29:22,740
And you also were the first big Super Gym,

1177
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:23,730
right?

1178
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:28,650
You were the first big American gym
that was producing like world champion

1179
00:29:28,651 --> 00:29:29,760
besides like the lions down.

1180
00:29:29,761 --> 00:29:31,020
I guess that's true.

1181
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:32,100
The lion's den too.

1182
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:32,521
Yeah,

1183
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:33,940
I guess they were the first we had to go.

1184
00:29:33,941 --> 00:29:34,291
So you are,

1185
00:29:34,291 --> 00:29:35,700
you guys got rivalry with them?

1186
00:29:35,701 --> 00:29:36,030
Yeah.

1187
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:38,040
We had a good rapport with the lion's den,

1188
00:29:38,041 --> 00:29:40,050
didn't produce as many world champions.

1189
00:29:40,051 --> 00:29:40,650
Me really big.

1190
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:42,020
Basically at frank and Ken and,

1191
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,930
and who else came out of the telling man?

1192
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:44,830
Yeah,

1193
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:45,250
a guy.

1194
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:46,490
Metzger guy.

1195
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,530
Massacre was a world champion.

1196
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,370
Yeah.

1197
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:48,910
Yeah.

1198
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:51,740
Metzker a also had that
kickboxing background.

1199
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:55,570
He had more of an American
style kickboxing background too.

1200
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,351
And the wrestling,

1201
00:29:56,351 --> 00:29:57,520
he had Russell before and stuff.

1202
00:29:57,521 --> 00:29:58,354
So that helped him.

1203
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:01,120
He had some great fights
and pride to yeah,

1204
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:01,960
absolutely.

1205
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,141
Yeah.

1206
00:30:02,141 --> 00:30:03,820
Metsker was super legit.

1207
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:05,410
He's a smart guy too.

1208
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:05,831
You know.

1209
00:30:05,831 --> 00:30:09,550
Metzker is an interesting fellow when
you hear him talk about fighting and talk

1210
00:30:09,551 --> 00:30:10,241
about his career.

1211
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:12,250
He's very open and honest about it.

1212
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,720
The holistic health now,

1213
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:14,291
you know,

1214
00:30:14,291 --> 00:30:14,531
he's,

1215
00:30:14,531 --> 00:30:14,980
he's,

1216
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,230
he's pretty wise to that
and I tell you what,

1217
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,130
if you,

1218
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:19,690
if you talk to him long enough,

1219
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:21,790
he'll have you sold on some products,

1220
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:22,660
you will.

1221
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:23,493
They're like,

1222
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:24,510
yeah,

1223
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:24,821
but you know,

1224
00:30:24,821 --> 00:30:25,654
he's a guy that uh,

1225
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,090
he suffered through that Vioxx Shit.

1226
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:31,360
You know that Vioxx stuff that people
were taking for heart attacks and all

1227
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:31,630
that.

1228
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:33,790
Stroke a stroke through Vioxx.

1229
00:30:33,791 --> 00:30:34,090
Yeah.

1230
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:37,000
They pulled that shit off the market
and when people were taking it,

1231
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,500
a lot of people were
taking getting strokes.

1232
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:41,350
I think someone Vioxx and Celebrex,

1233
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:42,571
Celebrex and other ones.

1234
00:30:42,571 --> 00:30:43,540
Celebrex was bad too.

1235
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,140
Yeah.

1236
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:47,590
There's a lot of weird drugs that people
were taken for arthritis that I guess

1237
00:30:47,591 --> 00:30:48,670
it was like a blood thinner.

1238
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:48,941
Right?

1239
00:30:48,941 --> 00:30:49,774
Is that,

1240
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,080
yeah.

1241
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,620
That was a lot of a lot of professional
athletes who were suffering from

1242
00:30:53,621 --> 00:30:55,690
inflammation and pain and
getting beat up and stuff.

1243
00:30:55,691 --> 00:30:56,920
We're all taking it and it was,

1244
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:57,101
yeah,

1245
00:30:57,101 --> 00:30:57,940
it was wrecking people.

1246
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:58,740
Yeah.

1247
00:30:58,740 --> 00:30:59,350
Um,

1248
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:00,010
but anyway,

1249
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:01,000
but back to your gym,

1250
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,620
like when you guys were doing it,

1251
00:31:02,621 --> 00:31:05,080
you guys were kind of
creating the roadmap.

1252
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:05,861
I mean,

1253
00:31:05,861 --> 00:31:07,270
there wasn't really a lot.

1254
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:10,090
I mean the lines then had their crazy,

1255
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:11,020
um,

1256
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:11,281
the,

1257
00:31:11,281 --> 00:31:11,531
the,

1258
00:31:11,531 --> 00:31:14,250
the initiation that they would do right,

1259
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,210
where they would run you
through this and sync gauntlet.

1260
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:16,400
Yeah.

1261
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,270
It was similar to what I guess
Ken had to go through in Japan,

1262
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,950
but candidate put that together.

1263
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:22,083
They had,

1264
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:24,100
they had their own little methods as well.

1265
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:25,660
I shouldn't say little methods.

1266
00:31:25,661 --> 00:31:26,490
They had their own food.

1267
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:28,060
They were very big and very crazy,

1268
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,670
but you guys like there wasn't,

1269
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,630
there wasn't like,

1270
00:31:31,631 --> 00:31:34,740
now you have att have Tristar,

1271
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:37,420
you have all these different gyms
you could sort of model after,

1272
00:31:37,421 --> 00:31:38,800
you know Rufus is camp.

1273
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,300
There's all these different
places we can say,

1274
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:40,720
oh,

1275
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,280
all these elite fighters come out of here.

1276
00:31:42,281 --> 00:31:43,210
How are they doing it?

1277
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:43,511
Oh,

1278
00:31:43,511 --> 00:31:44,620
I've trained with these guys,

1279
00:31:44,621 --> 00:31:47,290
I know their methods and here's what
they do for strength and conditioning.

1280
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,960
Here's how they take a here's
how to do the recovery work.

1281
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:50,530
Yeah.

1282
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:53,080
You guys were basically
at the front of the line.

1283
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:55,930
There was nobody back
there for you to look at.

1284
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:56,740
Well,

1285
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,300
what I was lucky enough to be,

1286
00:31:58,301 --> 00:31:59,020
like I said,

1287
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,450
I wasn't a world class restaurant.

1288
00:32:00,451 --> 00:32:01,151
It was a good Russell.

1289
00:32:01,151 --> 00:32:02,320
I beat some very good wrestlers,

1290
00:32:02,321 --> 00:32:04,990
but that was not by any means
even remotely worldclass.

1291
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:05,843
Right.

1292
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,290
I had some boxing experience.

1293
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:10,690
I've been around some great boxers
so I at least had that to start with.

1294
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:12,610
But I recognized,

1295
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:13,660
you know,

1296
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:14,440
I want to be,

1297
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:14,860
I want to,

1298
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:18,850
I want to be good enough to spar 12
rounds with a worldclass boxer and hang,

1299
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:24,360
hang and go an hour straight with a
worldclass BJJ black belt and go back and

1300
00:32:25,121 --> 00:32:28,180
forth with them and battle tooth and
nail to be able to hang in there.

1301
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:28,540
You know,

1302
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:31,270
the eyewear wrestling room during the
summer with the hot club guys who were

1303
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:35,560
absolute beast and frigging
throw it around and bouncing
off walls and spar with

1304
00:32:35,561 --> 00:32:35,920
good,

1305
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,950
good kickboxers and be able to do all
that stuff and then understand how the,

1306
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:40,070
how to put it all together.

1307
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,590
And I think that that,

1308
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:43,673
you know,

1309
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:48,730
at least enabled me to explain grappling
and wrestling to a Stryker from Stryker

1310
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,810
standpoint and vice versa.

1311
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:51,560
You know what I mean?

1312
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:54,680
So that was understanding angles
from a striking standpoint,

1313
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:58,220
from a wrestling standpoint and being
able to explain it and understand people.

1314
00:32:58,221 --> 00:33:00,110
And then you got to read people,

1315
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:00,651
you know,

1316
00:33:00,651 --> 00:33:00,930
their,

1317
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:01,790
their personality,

1318
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:02,340
right?

1319
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,530
You got to coach everybody different.

1320
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:07,610
You can't coach everybody the same way
because some people want to get screamed

1321
00:33:07,611 --> 00:33:09,920
at and some people want a
pat on the back of the hug.

1322
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:10,581
You know what I mean?

1323
00:33:10,581 --> 00:33:11,960
It's just you got to
read people differently.

1324
00:33:11,961 --> 00:33:13,250
Personalities are big deal.

1325
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:15,200
When you were putting together,

1326
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:16,550
when you were training fighters,

1327
00:33:16,551 --> 00:33:17,211
you first,

1328
00:33:17,211 --> 00:33:18,200
you started off,

1329
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:19,580
when you first start doing it,

1330
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:23,510
you were still fighting and you still
had a couple of fights along the way.

1331
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,200
Right.

1332
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,410
But when you are putting
together like training,

1333
00:33:27,411 --> 00:33:29,990
say if you were training fighter
for a big fight in the UFC,

1334
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:32,720
how did you put together their camp?

1335
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:35,450
Did you leave it up to them in some ways?

1336
00:33:35,451 --> 00:33:39,110
Did you just have them attend the
regular group training sessions?

1337
00:33:39,111 --> 00:33:40,940
Did you give them
individualized attention?

1338
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:41,300
I would,

1339
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:41,600
you know,

1340
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,120
I would give them individual attention.

1341
00:33:44,121 --> 00:33:44,720
Definitely.

1342
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,553
Definitely.

1343
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:47,450
I had to kind of figure out,

1344
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,160
everybody's body was different.

1345
00:33:49,161 --> 00:33:49,910
How to find that,

1346
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:53,090
that balance between aerobic
and anaerobic endurance.

1347
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:53,690
You know,

1348
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:55,970
some people needed more
of one or the other.

1349
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,020
Um,

1350
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:59,330
and then they'd come to
team training and everybody,

1351
00:33:59,390 --> 00:33:59,840
you know,

1352
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:04,840
you've got 40 guys in the room who are
all a bunch of killers and you just get

1353
00:34:05,061 --> 00:34:05,571
new guys.

1354
00:34:05,571 --> 00:34:08,150
And everybody was pretty good about
knowing this guy's getting ready for a

1355
00:34:08,151 --> 00:34:08,421
fight.

1356
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:09,500
Don't fucking hurting.

1357
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:10,250
That's,

1358
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:11,390
that's really important,

1359
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:12,141
you know,

1360
00:34:12,141 --> 00:34:12,500
so,

1361
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:16,250
so we were pretty good about as a group
looking out for somebody but pushing

1362
00:34:16,251 --> 00:34:18,410
them to their limit
constantly or double team.

1363
00:34:18,411 --> 00:34:19,071
And I'm constantly,

1364
00:34:19,071 --> 00:34:19,790
you know,

1365
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:22,760
every minute of the new guy jumping in
on I'm type stuff and doing that sort of,

1366
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:23,031
you know,

1367
00:34:23,031 --> 00:34:23,864
so it was,

1368
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:24,470
um,

1369
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:25,400
and obviously,

1370
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:26,810
you know,

1371
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:29,810
helping a guy like Hughes
who wasn't the best striker,

1372
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:31,670
we've got to do what we can
to get them better at it,

1373
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,593
you know what I mean?

1374
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:34,610
Or a striker who can't stop the take down.

1375
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:36,050
We've got to figure out
how to help this guy.

1376
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:40,490
I gotta put him with a bunch of wrestlers
and just having constantly sprawling,

1377
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:43,280
sprawling and sprawling and guys would
alternate and shoot and shoot and shoot

1378
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:44,810
and make them work at work at work at,

1379
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:45,411
you know,

1380
00:34:45,411 --> 00:34:46,100
that was the,

1381
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,280
it was just different
for each guy I guess.

1382
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:50,210
Now did you,

1383
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:53,300
did you have anything specific
that you would do in between camps?

1384
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:56,240
Like say if you had a guy
like cues and you say like he,

1385
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:57,110
he wins this fight,

1386
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,520
now I have some time off.

1387
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:02,930
Would you start working with them on
specific things like you would you have a

1388
00:35:02,931 --> 00:35:03,920
program you'd say like,

1389
00:35:03,921 --> 00:35:04,101
Matt,

1390
00:35:04,101 --> 00:35:05,090
we really got to tighten up,

1391
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:05,361
you know,

1392
00:35:05,361 --> 00:35:06,730
your standup defense or we have,

1393
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:07,310
you know,

1394
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:08,720
if they were healthy and stuff like that.

1395
00:35:08,721 --> 00:35:09,440
Absolutely.

1396
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:09,771
You know,

1397
00:35:09,771 --> 00:35:10,100
there's,

1398
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:14,450
there was just guys that it's so
hard for people to be well rounded.

1399
00:35:14,451 --> 00:35:15,051
It really is.

1400
00:35:15,051 --> 00:35:17,030
Especially when you're
that good at one thing.

1401
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:22,510
Hughes was such a powerful wrestler that
and so good on the ground that it was,

1402
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:23,510
you know,

1403
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:24,410
it was a challenge.

1404
00:35:24,411 --> 00:35:26,960
So we had to definitely
work extra with that.

1405
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:27,441
Well,

1406
00:35:27,441 --> 00:35:32,441
Matt was the first guy who was a really
great wrestler who also was outstanding

1407
00:35:32,481 --> 00:35:33,210
at submissions.

1408
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:34,010
Right.

1409
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:36,290
He really changed the game because like,

1410
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:37,260
like when he,

1411
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,190
that far

1412
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:39,840
side arm bar and George St Pierre,

1413
00:35:39,841 --> 00:35:41,490
it has a very tactical move.

1414
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:45,990
And to have a powerhouse wrestler
hit that in a world title fight.

1415
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,490
It's like that to me,

1416
00:35:47,491 --> 00:35:49,410
I think Matt doesn't get enough credit.

1417
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:49,921
Maybe see,

1418
00:35:49,921 --> 00:35:51,090
just because you know,

1419
00:35:51,091 --> 00:35:53,340
time passes and you start
looking at George Saint Pierre,

1420
00:35:53,341 --> 00:35:54,171
he started looking at all,

1421
00:35:54,171 --> 00:35:56,340
all these other guys with
would lose the champ now.

1422
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:00,360
And you sorta just forget like
that Matt was the blueprint.

1423
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,880
This is what happens when a really strong,

1424
00:36:02,881 --> 00:36:05,690
powerful wrestler absorbs the ground.

1425
00:36:05,691 --> 00:36:06,350
Right.

1426
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:07,011
Scary dude.

1427
00:36:07,011 --> 00:36:07,370
Yeah.

1428
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:07,641
That's,

1429
00:36:07,641 --> 00:36:08,540
that's where you go.

1430
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:10,580
You're not a Bjj guy.

1431
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:10,940
You're a,

1432
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:12,170
you're a catch as catch can.

1433
00:36:12,171 --> 00:36:12,920
Rustler right.

1434
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,161
You know,

1435
00:36:13,161 --> 00:36:15,200
you understand how to destroy somebody.

1436
00:36:15,201 --> 00:36:16,040
Control position,

1437
00:36:16,041 --> 00:36:17,360
beat 'em up and hit,

1438
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:17,721
you know,

1439
00:36:17,721 --> 00:36:18,590
power submissions,

1440
00:36:18,591 --> 00:36:19,371
finesse submissions,

1441
00:36:19,371 --> 00:36:19,651
all,

1442
00:36:19,651 --> 00:36:20,490
all that different stuff.

1443
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:21,020
Yeah.

1444
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:21,291
You know,

1445
00:36:21,291 --> 00:36:22,124
and that's,

1446
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:22,941
and when he was,

1447
00:36:22,941 --> 00:36:23,721
was in his prime,

1448
00:36:23,721 --> 00:36:24,860
I remember when he first,

1449
00:36:24,861 --> 00:36:29,480
I refereed his second fight
and he destroyed some poor
Brazilian and the guy was

1450
00:36:29,481 --> 00:36:30,350
a really good,

1451
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:34,580
legit blackbelt and Hughes beat him
half to death and it was in Chicago.

1452
00:36:34,581 --> 00:36:36,710
I refereed it and I
walked up to me when I go,

1453
00:36:36,711 --> 00:36:38,420
did you ever come to Iowa?

1454
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:39,950
I know I'll make you a world champ.

1455
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,330
There's just no doubt in my mind.

1456
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:42,770
That was the only guy I ever said that to.

1457
00:36:42,771 --> 00:36:45,020
The only guy I ever recruited
to be honest with you,

1458
00:36:45,021 --> 00:36:45,854
for the most part.

1459
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:47,750
So he shows up.

1460
00:36:47,751 --> 00:36:49,640
He drives three and a
half hours from Hillsboro,

1461
00:36:49,641 --> 00:36:50,360
Illinois.

1462
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,040
I've got bronchitis at the time,

1463
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,990
which made it even worse.

1464
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:55,483
And he goes,

1465
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:55,821
we are,

1466
00:36:55,821 --> 00:36:56,654
I am,

1467
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:57,110
let's,

1468
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:58,160
let's get this workout in.

1469
00:36:58,161 --> 00:36:58,460
Right?

1470
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:59,990
So we wrestled and grappled,

1471
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:00,770
you know,

1472
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:02,060
takedowns to submissions,

1473
00:37:02,061 --> 00:37:02,894
everything else.

1474
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:05,810
And about 30 minutes into it,

1475
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,080
I can't breathe in.

1476
00:37:07,081 --> 00:37:07,881
This guy is a monster.

1477
00:37:07,881 --> 00:37:10,700
I've had even 50 submissions and
he's shaken out to all of them.

1478
00:37:10,701 --> 00:37:12,770
Literally just like
bounced me off the walls.

1479
00:37:12,771 --> 00:37:13,910
It's so fucking strong.

1480
00:37:13,911 --> 00:37:14,744
I couldn't believe it.

1481
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:15,530
And that was,

1482
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:16,251
I was a strong guy.

1483
00:37:16,251 --> 00:37:16,521
I mean,

1484
00:37:16,521 --> 00:37:21,080
at the time I was probably mentioned
three 65 could dunk a basketball and run a

1485
00:37:21,081 --> 00:37:25,160
four four 40 so I was not a slouch athlete
when I was in my prime and I couldn't

1486
00:37:25,161 --> 00:37:26,000
believe this guy.

1487
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:29,540
I had never experienced somebody my
size being the strong in my life,

1488
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:31,160
that it's armor strength,

1489
00:37:31,161 --> 00:37:31,461
shit,

1490
00:37:31,461 --> 00:37:32,060
his roots,

1491
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:32,720
it is real.

1492
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,640
And I grew up half the Russell farmers,

1493
00:37:34,641 --> 00:37:35,300
trust me,

1494
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,230
the Royce Alger is,

1495
00:37:36,231 --> 00:37:37,160
and although Sundance,

1496
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:37,491
right?

1497
00:37:37,491 --> 00:37:37,970
Yeah.

1498
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:39,140
But I said to him,

1499
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:40,251
I go,

1500
00:37:40,251 --> 00:37:40,820
hold on man.

1501
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:41,001
I go,

1502
00:37:41,001 --> 00:37:41,571
I can't breathe.

1503
00:37:41,571 --> 00:37:42,291
I got bronchitis.

1504
00:37:42,291 --> 00:37:42,950
And he goes,

1505
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:43,783
fuck you.

1506
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:44,241
He goes,

1507
00:37:44,241 --> 00:37:44,931
I don't care what you got.

1508
00:37:44,931 --> 00:37:46,070
And I drove three and a half hours,

1509
00:37:46,071 --> 00:37:46,701
we're working out.

1510
00:37:46,701 --> 00:37:51,170
And he grabbed me and fucking train
doubled me onto my back all the way across

1511
00:37:51,171 --> 00:37:52,020
the room slams.

1512
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:52,780
It was like,

1513
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:53,330
all right,

1514
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:53,811
we're here,

1515
00:37:53,811 --> 00:37:54,560
let's get it done.

1516
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,150
So I got him in one guillotine.

1517
00:37:56,151 --> 00:37:57,260
I lifted him off its feet.

1518
00:37:57,290 --> 00:37:58,310
I ran him backwards.

1519
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:00,830
And Randy was hard as I could
ask first end of the wall.

1520
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:01,471
I mean,

1521
00:38:01,471 --> 00:38:01,760
I was just,

1522
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,570
I was trying to kill him.

1523
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:06,830
I was so pissed because he is
just a freak and he went limp.

1524
00:38:06,831 --> 00:38:08,150
He went unconscious for a second.

1525
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:10,070
So I let go of it and
he slid down the wall,

1526
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:10,731
hit his knees,

1527
00:38:10,731 --> 00:38:11,730
woke back up and train,

1528
00:38:11,731 --> 00:38:13,670
doubled me again onto my
back and went back at it.

1529
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:14,863
Right.

1530
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:16,190
So we get done,

1531
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:18,100
we get done with this hour or something,

1532
00:38:18,101 --> 00:38:19,760
work out of just go,

1533
00:38:19,761 --> 00:38:19,971
go,

1534
00:38:19,971 --> 00:38:20,600
go.

1535
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,560
And I looked at him and I go,

1536
00:38:21,561 --> 00:38:22,010
dude,

1537
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:22,843
what do you on?

1538
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:23,721
And he goes,

1539
00:38:23,721 --> 00:38:24,554
what do you mean?

1540
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:25,730
I go,

1541
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:29,210
what are you taking you on
some fucking steroids or what?

1542
00:38:29,211 --> 00:38:30,044
And he goes,

1543
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:30,891
and he got pissed.

1544
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:31,281
And he goes,

1545
00:38:31,281 --> 00:38:32,810
don't ever accuse me of that again.

1546
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:33,321
He goes,

1547
00:38:33,321 --> 00:38:34,154
fuck you.

1548
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:34,581
He goes,

1549
00:38:34,581 --> 00:38:35,500
don't ever say again.

1550
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:36,730
Never.

1551
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:40,180
That was like the one thing where if
somebody said to anything like that,

1552
00:38:40,181 --> 00:38:42,220
he was so offended because
he was just a farm boy.

1553
00:38:42,221 --> 00:38:44,530
His brother was frigging just
as strong if not stronger.

1554
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:44,981
Yeah.

1555
00:38:44,981 --> 00:38:46,240
His brother was a gorilla too.

1556
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:48,010
And his brother fought in UFC wants,

1557
00:38:48,011 --> 00:38:48,370
right?

1558
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:48,700
Yeah.

1559
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:51,400
And walking back to the
locker room after that fight,

1560
00:38:51,401 --> 00:38:52,330
his brother mark goes,

1561
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:54,370
that wasn't really all I expected.

1562
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,260
I really,

1563
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:56,831
it was fun,

1564
00:38:56,831 --> 00:38:58,000
but I don't think I'm,

1565
00:38:58,090 --> 00:38:58,990
I don't think I'm going to,

1566
00:38:58,991 --> 00:39:00,340
I don't enjoy that that much.

1567
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:01,541
And he killed the guy.

1568
00:39:01,541 --> 00:39:02,374
He beat the shit out of it.

1569
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:02,860
Right.

1570
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:03,340
Yeah.

1571
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:04,210
That's interesting.

1572
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:04,481
Yeah.

1573
00:39:04,481 --> 00:39:06,100
I mean even identical twins,

1574
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:08,530
they don't necessarily think identically.

1575
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:08,920
Right?

1576
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:09,190
Right.

1577
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:09,640
Yeah.

1578
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:09,851
Yeah.

1579
00:39:09,851 --> 00:39:10,684
Matt was a,

1580
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:15,280
he was a real freak and a real
important figure in the history of MMA,

1581
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:15,620
you know,

1582
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:16,100
like,

1583
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:19,330
cause you gotta think 1993 it all starts.

1584
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:22,450
And then from then on it's been
sort of this learning experience,

1585
00:39:22,451 --> 00:39:24,310
trying to figure out what
works and what doesn't work.

1586
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:25,390
And in my opinion,

1587
00:39:25,391 --> 00:39:29,950
Matt is one of the big pieces to that
puzzle because we had had some powerful

1588
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:30,761
wrestlers of course,

1589
00:39:30,761 --> 00:39:32,680
yet Coleman and so many other guys.

1590
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:34,900
And they were basically
all about ground and pound.

1591
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:35,381
I mean,

1592
00:39:35,381 --> 00:39:36,750
the only time Coleman got a submission,

1593
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:37,840
the UFC was when he,

1594
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:40,370
he fucking headlock Dan
Severen or can't open,

1595
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,700
take the lag in the head,

1596
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,650
the head go head lock.

1597
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:47,830
And you're going to eat
something like that.

1598
00:39:47,831 --> 00:39:48,071
Yeah.

1599
00:39:48,071 --> 00:39:49,360
It was like a judo star.

1600
00:39:49,361 --> 00:39:50,500
Pressor a compressor.

1601
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:51,030
Yeah.

1602
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:51,251
I mean,

1603
00:39:51,251 --> 00:39:51,491
look,

1604
00:39:51,491 --> 00:39:54,250
nobody wants to get stuck and that
would that fuck a gorilla back then.

1605
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:57,190
He was ungodly strong when I trained
him for the pride Grand Prix,

1606
00:39:57,191 --> 00:39:57,660
right?

1607
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:58,493
Yeah.

1608
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:59,680
He called me up and he goes,

1609
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:01,270
I want to come there and train with you.

1610
00:40:01,271 --> 00:40:03,250
And He'd lost two or three
fights in a row at that point.

1611
00:40:03,251 --> 00:40:05,800
So he was kind of cannon fodder
put into that pride Grand Prix.

1612
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,390
He was just a name at that point.

1613
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:08,501
And I go,

1614
00:40:08,501 --> 00:40:08,980
all right,

1615
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:09,491
come you,

1616
00:40:09,491 --> 00:40:09,911
come here,

1617
00:40:09,911 --> 00:40:11,140
you got to do everything I tell you to do.

1618
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:11,530
We're going to,

1619
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:12,311
we're going to train hard.

1620
00:40:12,311 --> 00:40:12,581
I'm going to,

1621
00:40:12,581 --> 00:40:13,311
I'm going to torture you.

1622
00:40:13,311 --> 00:40:13,371
Got,

1623
00:40:13,371 --> 00:40:13,780
and he was like,

1624
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:14,613
that's fine.

1625
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:15,850
And he,

1626
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,440
he wanted to come there.

1627
00:40:17,441 --> 00:40:19,810
I think because I had so
many scary dudes at the time,

1628
00:40:19,811 --> 00:40:21,520
like Steve Ross who wasn't even a fighter,

1629
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,650
could kill every fighter I've ever train.

1630
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:24,070
I mean,

1631
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:25,120
he'd just walk in the room,

1632
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:27,370
take off his fatigues from hunting,

1633
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:30,760
beat the shit out of everybody in the
room and then go back out hunting or

1634
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:31,210
fishing.

1635
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:31,751
That's just,

1636
00:40:31,751 --> 00:40:32,230
that's,

1637
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:33,880
that was Steve Ross and he didn't fight.

1638
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,350
He fought four times and just goes,

1639
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:37,060
you know what,

1640
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:37,810
I,

1641
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:38,330
I'm not,

1642
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:39,190
I'm not into it,

1643
00:40:39,191 --> 00:40:40,930
but I'll come into the gym
and help everybody get ready.

1644
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:41,470
He,

1645
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:43,090
he helped me coach my IFL team,

1646
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:46,690
but he was the guy that
after I fought Lindland,

1647
00:40:46,691 --> 00:40:48,250
when I got kicked out
of my weight division,

1648
00:40:48,251 --> 00:40:49,120
when the UFC goes,

1649
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,950
you gotta move up weight division.

1650
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:51,783
I went,

1651
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:53,290
why did they tell you you have to move up?

1652
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:53,771
They go,

1653
00:40:53,771 --> 00:40:56,170
you've trained yourself out of a spot.

1654
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:59,110
You have Jason Black,

1655
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:02,860
rob Lawler and Matt Hughes all
at one 70 they're all ranked,

1656
00:41:02,861 --> 00:41:04,150
I think in the s at the time,

1657
00:41:04,151 --> 00:41:05,170
top 10 in the world.

1658
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:06,363
And they go,

1659
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,271
and the,

1660
00:41:07,271 --> 00:41:09,940
I had done my comeback fight
after losing the title,

1661
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:11,730
Carlos knocked out Shonie Carter.

1662
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:15,100
So in my contract it said that I
have an automatic rematch clause.

1663
00:41:15,101 --> 00:41:15,934
Right.

1664
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:16,930
And they go,

1665
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:17,260
nope,

1666
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:18,040
not happening.

1667
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,450
You're moving up to one 85 and I go,

1668
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,460
I'm not big enough for one 85 right.

1669
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:23,290
But I realized at that point,

1670
00:41:23,291 --> 00:41:26,620
business wise how easily
I could be discarded.

1671
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,550
Right.

1672
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:28,180
And it Kinda,

1673
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:30,460
it kinda ruined me to be
honest with you mentally.

1674
00:41:30,461 --> 00:41:30,850
It just,

1675
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:31,181
I was like,

1676
00:41:31,181 --> 00:41:31,271
yeah,

1677
00:41:31,271 --> 00:41:32,110
I think I want to do this.

1678
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:34,280
But neither here nor there.

1679
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,480
Lindland after we fought,

1680
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:40,510
he came to my gym to train for one of
his fights and Steve Rusk is there that

1681
00:41:41,301 --> 00:41:45,350
day and rusk was a great Greco guy and
now it's the Olympic silver medalist,

1682
00:41:45,351 --> 00:41:50,300
Greco guy going against a guy that's
an unknown and Rusk ragdolls and we're

1683
00:41:50,301 --> 00:41:54,500
doing winner stays on the mat and Lynn
Lynn gets taken down and linen won't

1684
00:41:54,501 --> 00:41:55,130
leave the mat.

1685
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:57,470
He can't believe he's getting
taken down by a known name.

1686
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:58,400
Right.

1687
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,630
So Russ does it to him again.

1688
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:00,493
It does it to him again.

1689
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,340
That was a tune him again.

1690
00:42:01,341 --> 00:42:02,540
And finally the whole team goes,

1691
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:04,190
Lindland get off the mat,

1692
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:04,640
dude.

1693
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,650
Get the fuck out.

1694
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:06,340
Wow.

1695
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:07,640
Linen comes over and sits next to me.

1696
00:42:07,641 --> 00:42:07,940
He goes,

1697
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:09,170
who the fuck is that guy?

1698
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:10,141
I go,

1699
00:42:10,141 --> 00:42:11,030
let's Steve Ross.

1700
00:42:11,031 --> 00:42:12,190
He's just these,

1701
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:12,860
Steve,

1702
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:14,450
he's just everybody.

1703
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:17,600
A lot of those guys in gyms out there
that don't want to fight with their super

1704
00:42:17,601 --> 00:42:18,290
high level.

1705
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:22,190
Danaher was telling me about some guys
that he has in his gym that wreck some of

1706
00:42:22,191 --> 00:42:24,200
his best top guys that go in competition.

1707
00:42:24,201 --> 00:42:24,740
Absolutely.

1708
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:25,000
Yeah.

1709
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:25,191
No,

1710
00:42:25,191 --> 00:42:27,890
rusk was a guy who he grabbed,

1711
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,700
it was Dave Strauser who
fought in the UFC for awhile.

1712
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,750
They was a tough guy.

1713
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:32,630
It was very tough.

1714
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,220
But Russ grabbed the,

1715
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:35,203
he was in,

1716
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,053
uh,

1717
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:39,170
Dave's guard and he grabbed his foot
and his shin bone and went like,

1718
00:42:39,171 --> 00:42:40,730
this one was going to
just break his foot off.

1719
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:41,211
Right.

1720
00:42:41,211 --> 00:42:42,200
That's how strong this guy was.

1721
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,720
And Strausser taps out.

1722
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:46,640
It gets up and looking at him like,

1723
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:49,820
there's no way I'm ever
grappling with you again.

1724
00:42:49,821 --> 00:42:50,031
He goes,

1725
00:42:50,031 --> 00:42:50,811
stay away from me.

1726
00:42:50,811 --> 00:42:53,090
I don't want any part of you ever again.

1727
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:54,170
And uh,

1728
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:54,741
Nick Ackerman,

1729
00:42:54,741 --> 00:42:56,480
who was a national champion wrestler,

1730
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:59,330
he won the hodge trophy the same year.

1731
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:00,770
Cael Sanderson the one they,

1732
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:01,520
they were,

1733
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,353
uh,

1734
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,320
co recipients of it.

1735
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:06,170
And that Ackerman was the guy
who was a national champ who had,

1736
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:10,640
his legs were gone from his knees down
and Ackerman was almost as tall as me on

1737
00:43:10,641 --> 00:43:11,210
his knees.

1738
00:43:11,210 --> 00:43:15,050
That was another guy in our gym that
was so strong that he would just,

1739
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:17,350
he could just crush your
ribs by squeezing it.

1740
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,470
Just massive,

1741
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:19,483
massive power.

1742
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:20,930
It makes you wonder like,

1743
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:24,770
what would it be like to grapple
Carolyn when he's in his prime?

1744
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:28,640
Cause even the great grapplers
would grapple him and go,

1745
00:43:28,641 --> 00:43:30,470
what in the fuck is that all about?

1746
00:43:30,471 --> 00:43:30,850
He would,

1747
00:43:30,850 --> 00:43:31,130
yeah,

1748
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:33,020
he was gut wrenching
people and snap and spines.

1749
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:34,820
Literally snap and spines.

1750
00:43:34,821 --> 00:43:36,650
Like when guys would flatten out,

1751
00:43:36,651 --> 00:43:39,020
when you'd see a 290 pound man panic,

1752
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:41,000
like lay down flat on his stomach,

1753
00:43:41,001 --> 00:43:44,600
try to flatten out and do everything they
can to keep from getting launched and

1754
00:43:44,601 --> 00:43:49,020
he would pick them up like a half empty
sack of potatoes and a fucking slam the

1755
00:43:50,070 --> 00:43:50,840
Jesus.

1756
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,340
You ever see his parents know?

1757
00:43:52,490 --> 00:43:53,360
Tiny little people.

1758
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:54,050
Really?

1759
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:54,530
Yeah.

1760
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:56,720
They called them the experiment
where they gym gymnast.

1761
00:43:56,721 --> 00:43:59,960
One was a gymnast or something and the
other one was a little power lifter or

1762
00:43:59,961 --> 00:44:00,410
something.

1763
00:44:00,410 --> 00:44:00,600
I'm not,

1764
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:01,370
I'm not sure.

1765
00:44:01,370 --> 00:44:01,941
I'm not sure.

1766
00:44:01,941 --> 00:44:02,721
But they were like five,

1767
00:44:02,721 --> 00:44:03,290
five.

1768
00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:03,830
Right.

1769
00:44:03,830 --> 00:44:04,311
And you know,

1770
00:44:04,311 --> 00:44:04,881
you see him,

1771
00:44:04,881 --> 00:44:06,980
he was just this fucking giant panther.

1772
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:08,930
He really was like a panther.

1773
00:44:08,931 --> 00:44:09,530
Like he didn't,

1774
00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:11,420
he didn't even move like a big guy.

1775
00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:13,040
He moves like a small guy.

1776
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:13,750
Yeah.

1777
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:14,750
And he was a giant.

1778
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,140
I think that,

1779
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:16,460
you know,

1780
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:17,450
there was probably some,

1781
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:19,610
some sort of beat the system with that.

1782
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:20,390
Oh,

1783
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:23,150
what beaten the system that
was a part of this system.

1784
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:25,010
That fucking guy was on everything.

1785
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:26,750
100% when you look at his face,

1786
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:31,010
his forehead came forward and everything
just looked massive amounts of growth,

1787
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,070
all kinds of stuff.

1788
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:34,230
Probably had them on growth
and he was a little baby.

1789
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:34,621
I mean,

1790
00:44:34,621 --> 00:44:37,630
they'd probably just shot him up with
growth from the time he was little.

1791
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:38,550
That's scary.

1792
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:39,630
It's fucking terrifying.

1793
00:44:39,631 --> 00:44:41,760
But look what they're
doing right now in China.

1794
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:42,271
There he is.

1795
00:44:42,271 --> 00:44:43,800
Here's Carolyn in his prime,

1796
00:44:43,930 --> 00:44:45,290
like picking up a massive,

1797
00:44:45,291 --> 00:44:45,691
massive,

1798
00:44:45,691 --> 00:44:46,471
massive man.

1799
00:44:46,471 --> 00:44:47,970
This guys battle it to look at this.

1800
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:48,853
Ooh,

1801
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,310
I mean that guy,

1802
00:44:53,311 --> 00:44:56,550
that giant dude on the bottom probably
never had anybody rag Tom like that

1803
00:44:56,551 --> 00:44:57,384
before.

1804
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:01,170
And it was also like the way he would
work out when you see like some of the

1805
00:45:01,171 --> 00:45:02,220
shit that he would do,

1806
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:06,840
like some of his kettle bell workouts and
shield cast that he would do with club

1807
00:45:06,841 --> 00:45:09,150
bells and steel plates and shit.

1808
00:45:09,151 --> 00:45:10,470
He was all about movement,

1809
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:11,490
circular,

1810
00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:16,490
circular motions like so your gym
having all that true functional fit,

1811
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:18,930
like to see Indian clubs in your jam.

1812
00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:19,580
I went,

1813
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:19,891
all right,

1814
00:45:19,891 --> 00:45:20,724
he gets it.

1815
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:21,661
He really gets it.

1816
00:45:21,661 --> 00:45:22,261
Indian clubs,

1817
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:23,610
I collect all the old ones.

1818
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:24,370
Oh really?

1819
00:45:24,370 --> 00:45:25,350
And team woodlands,

1820
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:27,030
the huge wood ones,

1821
00:45:27,031 --> 00:45:27,630
right.

1822
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:28,411
All that sort of stuff.

1823
00:45:28,411 --> 00:45:33,000
So a guy named Ed Thomas taught me about
true functional fitness long before any

1824
00:45:33,001 --> 00:45:35,040
of this crossfit crap and
all this stuff came out,

1825
00:45:35,041 --> 00:45:35,760
right?

1826
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:36,780
So Ed Thomas,

1827
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:37,980
Dr Ed Thomas,

1828
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:39,240
and I didn't know he was a doctor.

1829
00:45:39,241 --> 00:45:40,650
He just showed up at my gym one day.

1830
00:45:40,651 --> 00:45:43,710
He walks in a little
unassuming dude and he goes,

1831
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:44,401
hey,

1832
00:45:44,401 --> 00:45:45,330
he goes patio Simon,

1833
00:45:45,331 --> 00:45:45,871
Ed Thomas.

1834
00:45:45,871 --> 00:45:46,704
He goes,

1835
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:48,900
do you have time for me
to teach you some stuff?

1836
00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:49,943
And when I went,

1837
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:50,750
sure,

1838
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:51,060
you know,

1839
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:52,230
whatever it was the middle of the day,

1840
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,130
nothing was going on.

1841
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,230
So he brings in Indian clubs,

1842
00:45:55,290 --> 00:45:56,190
kettlebells,

1843
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:57,870
old med medicine balls,

1844
00:45:57,871 --> 00:45:58,830
old leather stuff.

1845
00:45:58,831 --> 00:45:59,820
And I at the time,

1846
00:45:59,821 --> 00:46:00,870
never seen any of this stuff.

1847
00:46:00,871 --> 00:46:01,710
I didn't know anything about it.

1848
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:02,251
Well,

1849
00:46:02,251 --> 00:46:04,350
he was raised in the
Turner halls in Davenport,

1850
00:46:04,351 --> 00:46:05,100
Iowa,

1851
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:07,680
and that's where he learned functional
fitness on the Turner Halls were brought

1852
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:09,020
by the Germans here because the,

1853
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:10,410
the German Jews,

1854
00:46:10,411 --> 00:46:14,160
Turner halls back in Germany to train
a generation to become warriors,

1855
00:46:14,161 --> 00:46:14,994
to protect the nation.

1856
00:46:15,330 --> 00:46:16,740
And that's where that mentality came from.

1857
00:46:16,741 --> 00:46:18,420
So everything they did was cargo nets,

1858
00:46:18,421 --> 00:46:19,201
pommel horses,

1859
00:46:19,201 --> 00:46:20,100
Indian clubs,

1860
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:20,880
uh,

1861
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:21,780
heavy kettle bells,

1862
00:46:21,781 --> 00:46:23,760
all kinds of crazy just
functional fitness stuff.

1863
00:46:23,761 --> 00:46:25,050
They would climb cargo nets,

1864
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:26,870
serpentine and signed of them.

1865
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:27,210
Uh,

1866
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:30,960
they would swing the cargo nets and the
kids would Serpentini in and out of them

1867
00:46:30,961 --> 00:46:31,830
as it was swinging.

1868
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:33,030
All kinds of crazy stuff.

1869
00:46:33,031 --> 00:46:33,720
Right.

1870
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:34,290
Um,

1871
00:46:34,290 --> 00:46:37,230
definitely the rings that were doing
a lot of the rings stuff and power,

1872
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:37,530
you know,

1873
00:46:37,530 --> 00:46:38,820
being able to do iron crosses,

1874
00:46:38,821 --> 00:46:39,654
all that sort of stuff.

1875
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:40,920
That's the way they raised their kids.

1876
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:43,350
And so he was at the time,

1877
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,890
I think it's still is one of the first
and foremost guys on functional fitness.

1878
00:46:46,891 --> 00:46:49,260
He was the guy that taught me how to
train upside down with gravity boots,

1879
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:53,850
doing all kinds of crazy stuff with
medicine balls and kettle bells and bands

1880
00:46:53,851 --> 00:46:55,440
and everything else you
could do standing up,

1881
00:46:55,470 --> 00:46:56,640
you could do upside down.

1882
00:46:56,641 --> 00:46:58,140
And he rebuilt me at the time,

1883
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:00,630
but he came in,

1884
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:01,800
taught me for an hour.

1885
00:47:01,830 --> 00:47:02,101
He said,

1886
00:47:02,101 --> 00:47:03,480
I'll leave this equipment here with Ya.

1887
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:07,200
You can teach your guys what I taught
you and I'll come back another time.

1888
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:08,461
And I was like,

1889
00:47:08,461 --> 00:47:08,641
yeah.

1890
00:47:08,641 --> 00:47:09,720
And we were talking for a second.

1891
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:11,130
I got on the phone and I turned around.

1892
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:11,960
He was gone.

1893
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:16,080
Well he said he was a
three times in Vietnam.

1894
00:47:16,081 --> 00:47:16,914
He was a tunnel rat.

1895
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:18,570
He signed up for extra tours.

1896
00:47:18,571 --> 00:47:19,740
He would go in and kill the Vietcong,

1897
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:20,130
sleep,

1898
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:21,240
sleep amongst the bodies,

1899
00:47:21,690 --> 00:47:24,600
and then go back out and find
another tunnel and kill people again.

1900
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:25,321
That's what you're going for.

1901
00:47:25,321 --> 00:47:25,771
Three years.

1902
00:47:25,771 --> 00:47:26,970
Just hardcore guy.

1903
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:30,160
But I'm the guy that owned times at,

1904
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:30,791
at the time,

1905
00:47:30,791 --> 00:47:33,190
his kid was trained and
underneath me and he goes,

1906
00:47:33,191 --> 00:47:34,210
I heard you met a friend of mine.

1907
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:34,871
And I go,

1908
00:47:34,871 --> 00:47:35,211
who's that?

1909
00:47:35,211 --> 00:47:35,501
And he goes,

1910
00:47:35,501 --> 00:47:36,430
Doctor Ed Thomas.

1911
00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:36,911
And I go,

1912
00:47:36,911 --> 00:47:37,061
well,

1913
00:47:37,061 --> 00:47:37,990
he didn't say he was a doctor,

1914
00:47:37,991 --> 00:47:40,690
but I could tell he was one of the most
intelligent people I've ever met in my

1915
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:41,524
life.

1916
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:41,951
He goes,

1917
00:47:41,951 --> 00:47:42,131
yeah,

1918
00:47:42,131 --> 00:47:42,310
he's,

1919
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:43,090
he's a scholar.

1920
00:47:43,090 --> 00:47:43,301
I mean,

1921
00:47:43,301 --> 00:47:45,340
this guy's a warrior genius,

1922
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:46,050
right?

1923
00:47:46,050 --> 00:47:46,510
He's amazing.

1924
00:47:46,510 --> 00:47:47,343
And he's still,

1925
00:47:47,350 --> 00:47:48,220
he's still up in De Moines,

1926
00:47:48,221 --> 00:47:49,040
Iowa.

1927
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,290
Haven't talked to him for a few years,

1928
00:47:50,291 --> 00:47:53,380
but that guy taught me what
real fitness was about.

1929
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:55,293
Wow.

1930
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:55,661
This,

1931
00:47:55,661 --> 00:47:56,494
what year was this,

1932
00:47:57,670 --> 00:47:58,330
Dear God,

1933
00:47:58,330 --> 00:47:58,720
I don't remember.

1934
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,490
I've been having to head
so much or whatever.

1935
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:00,821
Yeah.

1936
00:48:00,821 --> 00:48:03,640
Now you're great for a guy who's
been hitting add as many as you,

1937
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:05,170
but I never had a concussion.

1938
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:07,480
I will say that we must
have never had a concussion.

1939
00:48:07,481 --> 00:48:07,840
Really?

1940
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:08,440
Nope.

1941
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:08,881
But what is it?

1942
00:48:08,881 --> 00:48:09,700
Concussion.

1943
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:10,570
Concussion is like,

1944
00:48:10,571 --> 00:48:10,691
well,

1945
00:48:10,691 --> 00:48:11,890
they check your pupils.

1946
00:48:11,891 --> 00:48:13,450
They're not dialing directly.

1947
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:14,313
None of it.

1948
00:48:14,530 --> 00:48:14,861
None of them.

1949
00:48:14,861 --> 00:48:16,000
No concussions and all,

1950
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:17,200
all that hard sparring.

1951
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:17,860
Nope.

1952
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:18,190
Never.

1953
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:19,280
I find that hard to believe it.

1954
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:21,280
He never got hit with a shot
that they didn't see coming.

1955
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:22,653
And I think that's,

1956
00:48:22,990 --> 00:48:23,650
nope.

1957
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:23,980
Nope.

1958
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:24,280
Wow.

1959
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:27,280
Besides one time in a huge fight where
a dude hit me in the side of the head

1960
00:48:27,281 --> 00:48:27,761
with a brick,

1961
00:48:27,761 --> 00:48:28,810
and I saw it last second,

1962
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:29,800
I at least rolled with it.

1963
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:31,540
And that didn't give you a concussion?

1964
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:32,090
He,

1965
00:48:32,090 --> 00:48:32,560
I,

1966
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:32,981
he,

1967
00:48:32,981 --> 00:48:33,730
uh,

1968
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:34,540
it was a huge bro.

1969
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:35,910
It was hip hop night at the nightclub.

1970
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:36,730
I was bouncing that,

1971
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:36,881
oh,

1972
00:48:36,881 --> 00:48:37,714
sounds like fun.

1973
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:42,370
And the head and the Illinois Gang
bangers and the Iowa gangbangers started

1974
00:48:42,371 --> 00:48:45,100
going at it and I tried breaking
it up and they all attacked me.

1975
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:45,550
Right?

1976
00:48:45,550 --> 00:48:46,270
Jesus.

1977
00:48:46,270 --> 00:48:47,160
So that's when I,

1978
00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:47,951
everybody was wearing,

1979
00:48:47,951 --> 00:48:48,671
it was winter time.

1980
00:48:48,671 --> 00:48:49,780
So I was choking people.

1981
00:48:49,781 --> 00:48:52,750
A guy got me in a headlock and I was
grabbing people by their coat lapels.

1982
00:48:53,050 --> 00:48:55,660
And I'd hit my head in between his
head and his head and I'd choke him

1983
00:48:55,661 --> 00:48:56,171
unconscious.

1984
00:48:56,171 --> 00:49:00,010
I'd find a new coat and I was working
my way backwards out the front door and

1985
00:49:00,011 --> 00:49:01,360
finally snuck out of the headlock,

1986
00:49:01,361 --> 00:49:02,290
put him in a rear choke,

1987
00:49:02,291 --> 00:49:03,400
went backwards off the door.

1988
00:49:03,730 --> 00:49:04,510
He went limp.

1989
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:05,350
I dropped him.

1990
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:08,080
And then as I turned to
get out into the street,

1991
00:49:08,081 --> 00:49:09,520
cause there was cops
everywhere at that point.

1992
00:49:09,521 --> 00:49:10,241
There's dogs,

1993
00:49:10,241 --> 00:49:10,530
there's,

1994
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:11,570
it's a snow storm.

1995
00:49:12,010 --> 00:49:12,611
Last second,

1996
00:49:12,611 --> 00:49:16,360
I see this coming at the side of my head
and I duck and it bounces off my head

1997
00:49:16,930 --> 00:49:17,890
and this dude goes,

1998
00:49:17,891 --> 00:49:18,550
yeah,

1999
00:49:18,550 --> 00:49:21,450
like I was going to go down and I turned
and I looked at him and rifle came with

2000
00:49:21,451 --> 00:49:22,720
a right hand and knocked him out.

2001
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:25,720
And then the next thing you know
there's just dogs diving into the crowd.

2002
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:27,160
It was a good one.

2003
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:27,970
That was a fun one.

2004
00:49:27,970 --> 00:49:28,690
Dogs,

2005
00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:29,523
that's not good.

2006
00:49:29,530 --> 00:49:31,420
No dogs work.

2007
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:32,343
They work,

2008
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:33,580
they work real well.

2009
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:36,280
That's not good because they don't
know who the fuck they're biting.

2010
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:37,091
They might bite you.

2011
00:49:37,091 --> 00:49:38,410
They might bite the bad guys.

2012
00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:39,221
I mean,

2013
00:49:39,221 --> 00:49:41,680
who the fuck dogs don't
know who the bouncer is?

2014
00:49:41,681 --> 00:49:43,080
You know they clear crowd
out real quick though.

2015
00:49:43,081 --> 00:49:44,020
Fuck yeah they do.

2016
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,820
And Almaas is that other using a,

2017
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,310
back then it was shepherds really.

2018
00:49:48,311 --> 00:49:49,300
It was all German shepherds.

2019
00:49:49,301 --> 00:49:49,451
Yeah.

2020
00:49:49,451 --> 00:49:51,370
Melon was hadn't even entered
the scene at that time.

2021
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:54,200
I have a buddy who trains dogs who
doesn't like Mal Mois says there too.

2022
00:49:54,201 --> 00:49:56,110
Two bloodthirsty said
they were aggressive.

2023
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:56,400
Yeah.

2024
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:56,650
He goes,

2025
00:49:56,650 --> 00:49:57,550
they don't listen as well.

2026
00:49:57,610 --> 00:49:57,941
Interesting.

2027
00:49:57,941 --> 00:49:58,181
He goes,

2028
00:49:58,181 --> 00:49:58,421
he goes,

2029
00:49:58,421 --> 00:49:59,470
I can trust the shepherd.

2030
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:00,401
He goes bite,

2031
00:50:00,401 --> 00:50:01,480
hold and release.

2032
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:01,810
Yeah.

2033
00:50:01,810 --> 00:50:02,171
He's like,

2034
00:50:02,171 --> 00:50:04,540
if I stick a Malmo on and
it goes to the fuck knows,

2035
00:50:04,541 --> 00:50:05,021
he goes also,

2036
00:50:05,021 --> 00:50:06,490
I don't trust him like as a pet.

2037
00:50:06,550 --> 00:50:07,030
Right.

2038
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:07,301
You know,

2039
00:50:07,301 --> 00:50:11,440
he wants a dog that is
is a real train bite dog,

2040
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:13,210
but also good with the family.

2041
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:13,681
Yeah.

2042
00:50:13,681 --> 00:50:14,690
I can hang out with your kid.

2043
00:50:14,691 --> 00:50:15,060
Right.

2044
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:17,140
Well what's like iPhone mastiffs before,

2045
00:50:17,141 --> 00:50:17,470
right.

2046
00:50:17,470 --> 00:50:19,020
And massive mass stuff there.

2047
00:50:19,070 --> 00:50:19,440
You know,

2048
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:23,740
I had brindle mastiff and I always loved
to have males and I had a stalker for

2049
00:50:23,741 --> 00:50:25,510
three years who was a psychopath.

2050
00:50:25,511 --> 00:50:26,230
Right.

2051
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:28,370
So that was when I got
first mass duff king.

2052
00:50:28,371 --> 00:50:30,710
He was 210 pounds,

2053
00:50:30,711 --> 00:50:32,870
but he was a brindle scary
look like a Bengal tiger.

2054
00:50:32,871 --> 00:50:33,590
Right.

2055
00:50:33,590 --> 00:50:37,160
And he that those dogs are so powerful,

2056
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:37,791
you know,

2057
00:50:37,791 --> 00:50:41,480
at that size when they're truly in
shape where you can't stop them.

2058
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:44,960
And there were people that were using
mass stuffs for police work and they

2059
00:50:44,961 --> 00:50:48,380
stopped using them because a 210
pound mass mastiff on a human being,

2060
00:50:48,381 --> 00:50:49,730
they can kill them really fast.

2061
00:50:50,210 --> 00:50:50,930
This is not a,

2062
00:50:50,930 --> 00:50:51,950
this is not a bite dog.

2063
00:50:51,951 --> 00:50:54,440
This is a dog that can just have a screw,

2064
00:50:54,441 --> 00:50:56,250
go loose and rip somebody,

2065
00:50:56,251 --> 00:50:57,140
throw it out in a heartbeat.

2066
00:50:57,170 --> 00:50:58,150
It just too big and powerful.

2067
00:50:58,220 --> 00:51:01,520
That hurts them if something
hurts them and they think,

2068
00:51:01,521 --> 00:51:01,730
oh,

2069
00:51:01,730 --> 00:51:02,563
this is a fight,

2070
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:03,140
right.

2071
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:05,840
I'm just going to rip your
fucking head clean off your body.

2072
00:51:06,350 --> 00:51:07,270
And that mass,

2073
00:51:07,271 --> 00:51:10,790
they've tested me a couple times
for Alpha position in the house.

2074
00:51:10,850 --> 00:51:11,683
Oh No,

2075
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:12,523
it was one time up,

2076
00:51:12,890 --> 00:51:17,420
a plastic bag in the wind was rolling
through the woods and on my property and

2077
00:51:17,421 --> 00:51:19,490
he ran and he grabbed it and I told him,

2078
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:19,770
you know,

2079
00:51:19,770 --> 00:51:20,840
King come here front.

2080
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:23,600
And he came up to me and I put my
hand on the plastic bag and he goes,

2081
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:25,811
it's like,

2082
00:51:25,811 --> 00:51:26,181
all right,

2083
00:51:26,181 --> 00:51:26,881
here it is.

2084
00:51:26,881 --> 00:51:27,530
This is,

2085
00:51:27,530 --> 00:51:28,460
this is test time.

2086
00:51:28,970 --> 00:51:31,130
So I ripped the bag and
it came out of his mouth.

2087
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:31,610
Right.

2088
00:51:31,610 --> 00:51:33,560
And he really got pissed off at me.

2089
00:51:33,770 --> 00:51:34,603
I was testing him.

2090
00:51:35,030 --> 00:51:36,380
So at that point I'm like,

2091
00:51:36,381 --> 00:51:36,740
well,

2092
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:39,110
I can't back down to it
now because this is it.

2093
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:43,520
So I put my fist against his teeth that
he was showing and it was going to do it

2094
00:51:43,950 --> 00:51:47,970
till it sees this and he's like
this with his teeth going there,

2095
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:49,450
I'm going to do it,

2096
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:50,330
Joe it.

2097
00:51:50,330 --> 00:51:53,360
And finally he turned and backed off and
then I pet him and he was wagging his

2098
00:51:53,361 --> 00:51:53,931
tail and I was like,

2099
00:51:53,931 --> 00:51:54,764
all right.

2100
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:55,460
Ooh,

2101
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:55,850
that was,

2102
00:51:55,850 --> 00:51:56,750
that was kind of scary.

2103
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:58,190
Right?

2104
00:51:58,190 --> 00:52:00,080
Parsons got in a fist
fight with his massive.

2105
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:00,590
Really?

2106
00:52:00,590 --> 00:52:00,951
Yeah.

2107
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:02,900
He had a Neapolitan massive in college.

2108
00:52:03,050 --> 00:52:04,470
They got in a fist fight.

2109
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:05,331
He goes,

2110
00:52:05,331 --> 00:52:06,380
it was a real fight.

2111
00:52:06,550 --> 00:52:06,861
And he goes,

2112
00:52:06,861 --> 00:52:07,890
I had a fight with my man.

2113
00:52:07,891 --> 00:52:08,690
I'm like,

2114
00:52:08,690 --> 00:52:09,523
maybe,

2115
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:14,210
maybe you did more likely you punched
your mastiff cause it does a real fight.

2116
00:52:14,211 --> 00:52:14,971
I wouldn't be talking to you.

2117
00:52:14,971 --> 00:52:16,020
You be chunks missing out.

2118
00:52:16,021 --> 00:52:16,130
Yeah.

2119
00:52:16,130 --> 00:52:18,230
You'd be fucking dead of Neapolitan.

2120
00:52:18,231 --> 00:52:19,670
That's a giant fucking dog.

2121
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:21,860
I have a regency massive,

2122
00:52:22,150 --> 00:52:23,240
they're half massive Hass,

2123
00:52:23,330 --> 00:52:24,080
half pit bull.

2124
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:24,651
Oh Wow.

2125
00:52:24,651 --> 00:52:25,484
About a buck 40.

2126
00:52:25,490 --> 00:52:26,330
That's a beautiful dog guy.

2127
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:27,170
But he's a great dog.

2128
00:52:27,170 --> 00:52:27,891
He's old now.

2129
00:52:27,891 --> 00:52:28,700
He's like 12.

2130
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:29,240
Okay.

2131
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:29,550
He's,

2132
00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:30,383
he's had some,

2133
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:31,940
some years under him.

2134
00:52:31,941 --> 00:52:33,200
Just socializing really good.

2135
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:33,381
Oh,

2136
00:52:33,381 --> 00:52:34,130
he's a great dog.

2137
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:35,780
He's the best over here.

2138
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:37,550
Gets along with every dog.

2139
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:38,300
Every person.

2140
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:38,930
That's good.

2141
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:41,510
I got him because his
dad was on fear factor.

2142
00:52:41,810 --> 00:52:43,980
His Dad was an attack dog on fear factor.

2143
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,950
People in a bite to eat
and they try to run away.

2144
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:46,700
And His dad,

2145
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:48,230
his dad was also the,

2146
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:48,560
um,

2147
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:50,480
the dog that they modeled,

2148
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:51,890
they used him for Cgi,

2149
00:52:51,891 --> 00:52:52,724
for the hulk.

2150
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:53,471
Remember when the,

2151
00:52:53,471 --> 00:52:54,200
the original,

2152
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:58,190
the one of the hulk movies
with Nick naulty and Eric Bana.

2153
00:52:58,310 --> 00:53:00,290
Nick naulty was the bad guy.

2154
00:53:00,291 --> 00:53:02,210
He used the hulks dad and he,

2155
00:53:02,211 --> 00:53:03,044
um,

2156
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:05,570
he had injected hulks serum
and it was fucking dogs.

2157
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:08,750
And so that the dogs would get
to a certain point and it would,

2158
00:53:08,751 --> 00:53:08,971
uh,

2159
00:53:08,971 --> 00:53:09,210
you know,

2160
00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:09,890
to get angry.

2161
00:53:09,890 --> 00:53:10,910
They'd talk to them raw.

2162
00:53:11,170 --> 00:53:14,390
They would hawk out when they
turn green now they were just big.

2163
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:15,393
Okay.

2164
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:15,890
Yeah.

2165
00:53:15,890 --> 00:53:16,850
It seems like they should.

2166
00:53:16,851 --> 00:53:17,684
Right?

2167
00:53:17,970 --> 00:53:18,720
Maybe they did.

2168
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:18,961
No,

2169
00:53:18,961 --> 00:53:19,711
I don't think they did.

2170
00:53:19,711 --> 00:53:21,330
I think they just look at the findings.

2171
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:23,041
Jamie found it.

2172
00:53:23,041 --> 00:53:23,760
Yeah.

2173
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:24,420
Oh dear God.

2174
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:25,253
Yeah.

2175
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:26,813
That's scary.

2176
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:31,170
That was like real bad CGI to
boy when you watched that movie.

2177
00:53:31,171 --> 00:53:32,910
It's funny cause that
wasn't that long ago,

2178
00:53:32,970 --> 00:53:33,150
right?

2179
00:53:33,150 --> 00:53:35,790
I think that was only like 15 years ago.

2180
00:53:35,791 --> 00:53:36,624
What year was that?

2181
00:53:37,170 --> 00:53:38,003
If you had to guess?

2182
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:39,923
15 years ago.

2183
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:42,660
So his dad,

2184
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:43,530
my dog,

2185
00:53:43,530 --> 00:53:44,363
Johnny Cash,

2186
00:53:44,490 --> 00:53:49,110
his dad curly was in fear factor and
that was literally what he was built.

2187
00:53:49,111 --> 00:53:49,830
Like wow.

2188
00:53:49,830 --> 00:53:50,970
But smaller than that,

2189
00:53:50,971 --> 00:53:51,610
obviously that's,

2190
00:53:51,610 --> 00:53:52,650
that's when he helps out.

2191
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:55,230
So they took him and
sort of exaggerated him.

2192
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:55,650
Huh.

2193
00:53:55,650 --> 00:53:58,350
Basically looked like that
you could find him just,

2194
00:53:58,351 --> 00:54:00,960
just Google regency mastiff curly.

2195
00:54:01,050 --> 00:54:01,661
He was a,

2196
00:54:01,661 --> 00:54:05,010
a famous stud cause it's
just fucking ridiculous dog.

2197
00:54:05,011 --> 00:54:08,040
But the thing about the dog
was when we had him on the set,

2198
00:54:08,041 --> 00:54:09,540
he would just fucking chill.

2199
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:10,830
He was a black dog.

2200
00:54:10,890 --> 00:54:11,940
So none of those are him.

2201
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:13,560
It's probably a lot of dogs named curly.

2202
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:14,010
It's all right.

2203
00:54:14,010 --> 00:54:14,843
It doesn't,

2204
00:54:15,090 --> 00:54:15,923
but um,

2205
00:54:16,270 --> 00:54:17,820
the dog was just so friendly,

2206
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:18,420
like,

2207
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:19,980
and then when it was time to go,

2208
00:54:19,981 --> 00:54:21,420
when they put the bite suit on people,

2209
00:54:21,570 --> 00:54:25,560
it was hilarious because we were using
[inaudible] for awhile and you get like a

2210
00:54:25,561 --> 00:54:27,760
big football player type
dude is about two 40.

2211
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:30,570
They can't bring them down cause they
could hold onto it and they could,

2212
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:31,740
that dog is only 60,

2213
00:54:31,741 --> 00:54:32,330
70 pounds.

2214
00:54:32,330 --> 00:54:33,720
He come around curly,

2215
00:54:33,721 --> 00:54:36,300
grab a hold of you and it would
be like they got hit by a truck.

2216
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:38,580
It would just go fly in
and crash to the ground.

2217
00:54:38,850 --> 00:54:41,130
And one of the ones that we
did was actually my friend,

2218
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:43,170
ed's girlfriend was on the show.

2219
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:43,801
And,

2220
00:54:43,801 --> 00:54:43,921
uh,

2221
00:54:43,921 --> 00:54:44,850
I knew her before.

2222
00:54:44,851 --> 00:54:45,181
It was like,

2223
00:54:45,181 --> 00:54:45,871
oh Jesus.

2224
00:54:45,871 --> 00:54:49,650
I felt bad because she weighed like a
buck 10 and they're putting her in this

2225
00:54:49,651 --> 00:54:54,651
fucking bite suit and then curly hits
her like literally like she got hit by a

2226
00:54:54,691 --> 00:54:55,524
tree.

2227
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:56,700
Like someone took a tree,

2228
00:54:56,701 --> 00:54:59,400
one of those swinging trees and just boom.

2229
00:54:59,430 --> 00:55:00,270
Did she get her skills?

2230
00:55:00,510 --> 00:55:01,170
She was okay.

2231
00:55:01,170 --> 00:55:01,441
She,

2232
00:55:01,441 --> 00:55:02,274
she's a tough kid.

2233
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:03,030
How many,

2234
00:55:03,030 --> 00:55:05,610
how many episodes of fear factor
did you do where you were like,

2235
00:55:05,611 --> 00:55:09,240
this is horrible to do to one
when they had a ride bulls one,

2236
00:55:09,241 --> 00:55:10,480
when they had a drink come there.

2237
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:15,073
I'll

2238
00:55:15,990 --> 00:55:17,880
see the dog gets these people just boom,

2239
00:55:17,910 --> 00:55:18,780
get down bitch.

2240
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:20,580
Like you're not going nowhere.

2241
00:55:20,610 --> 00:55:20,851
Oh,

2242
00:55:20,851 --> 00:55:21,684
nice.

2243
00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:25,520
But the problem was with these dogs is
they bite so hard that if they get ahold

2244
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:26,940
of a bone through the suit,

2245
00:55:26,941 --> 00:55:27,870
they can break a bone.

2246
00:55:27,890 --> 00:55:28,620
Yeah.

2247
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:29,453
Anyway.

2248
00:55:29,550 --> 00:55:29,881
Anyway,

2249
00:55:29,881 --> 00:55:30,630
great dogs.

2250
00:55:30,630 --> 00:55:32,040
You had people drink Kombucha on free.

2251
00:55:32,041 --> 00:55:32,760
I don't drink.

2252
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:33,280
I never saw.

2253
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:33,840
What was it like?

2254
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:34,673
It never aired.

2255
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:36,000
It was a donkey come.

2256
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:41,220
What happened was it
got out on Tmz and then,

2257
00:55:41,221 --> 00:55:41,910
uh,

2258
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:42,091
we,

2259
00:55:42,091 --> 00:55:44,220
they played horse shoes and a,

2260
00:55:44,221 --> 00:55:45,750
they had a day at a drink,

2261
00:55:45,810 --> 00:55:48,030
donkey come and donkey urine.

2262
00:55:48,810 --> 00:55:49,770
And uh,

2263
00:55:49,830 --> 00:55:50,101
yeah,

2264
00:55:50,101 --> 00:55:50,934
that's hard course.

2265
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:51,630
It was hardcore.

2266
00:55:51,630 --> 00:55:52,020
That was,

2267
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:53,340
there's two episodes where I said,

2268
00:55:53,341 --> 00:55:54,174
don't do it.

2269
00:55:54,390 --> 00:55:57,270
One of them was riding bulls and the
other one was the donkey Kong people got

2270
00:55:57,271 --> 00:55:57,720
hurt.

2271
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:57,990
Right.

2272
00:55:57,990 --> 00:55:59,820
The riding bulls that we got lucky.

2273
00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:00,871
No one got hurt.

2274
00:56:00,871 --> 00:56:01,704
We got luck.

2275
00:56:01,850 --> 00:56:04,560
Just roll the dice because
this was the funny,

2276
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:05,790
this fucking stunt man.

2277
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:07,680
I'm sure you were working
around stockmen before,

2278
00:56:07,710 --> 00:56:08,010
right?

2279
00:56:08,010 --> 00:56:08,820
Fucking animals.

2280
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:09,180
Yeah.

2281
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:11,490
They didn't give a shit broken
bonds on mean anything to them.

2282
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:12,340
Those guys are,

2283
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:13,350
they're animals.

2284
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:16,970
They're just some of the toughest fucking
people for sure in all of show up.

2285
00:56:17,610 --> 00:56:18,250
And uh,

2286
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:19,230
their attitude was like,

2287
00:56:19,231 --> 00:56:19,411
yeah,

2288
00:56:19,411 --> 00:56:20,160
that'd be fine.

2289
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:20,993
That'd be fine.

2290
00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:22,560
And so my friend Perry,

2291
00:56:22,561 --> 00:56:23,770
who was the stunt guy was like,

2292
00:56:23,771 --> 00:56:24,040
don't worry

2293
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:24,281
about it.

2294
00:56:24,281 --> 00:56:24,431
Boo.

2295
00:56:24,431 --> 00:56:26,230
There's stunt dogs or their stunt bowls.

2296
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:26,650
Right.

2297
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:27,020
I go there.

2298
00:56:27,020 --> 00:56:27,853
Stunt bowls,

2299
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:29,171
fucking fold.

2300
00:56:29,171 --> 00:56:29,351
No,

2301
00:56:29,351 --> 00:56:30,010
he's Istanbul.

2302
00:56:30,010 --> 00:56:31,200
Did you have a conversation with that,

2303
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:31,920
Paul?

2304
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:33,100
Because he understands that's a ball.

2305
00:56:33,610 --> 00:56:35,920
That's how bull are so big.

2306
00:56:36,070 --> 00:56:36,701
Because we were,

2307
00:56:36,701 --> 00:56:38,770
I was standing next to the
person while they were,

2308
00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:39,430
they were,

2309
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:39,671
you know,

2310
00:56:39,671 --> 00:56:41,260
there's the pen and they,

2311
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:41,890
they,

2312
00:56:41,890 --> 00:56:44,080
they sit on top of the ball
and you're right there.

2313
00:56:44,081 --> 00:56:46,630
So I'm standing right next to
him on the platform and I'm like,

2314
00:56:46,631 --> 00:56:47,464
don't do it.

2315
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:49,210
There's no way you're going to hang on.

2316
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:50,310
There's no,

2317
00:56:50,350 --> 00:56:51,070
we,

2318
00:56:51,070 --> 00:56:55,750
my first year in college wrestling at
Sioux Empire up by the South Dakota

2319
00:56:55,751 --> 00:56:56,584
border,

2320
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:57,700
middle of nowhere,

2321
00:56:57,820 --> 00:56:59,730
we got recruited by a guy
that was an all American.

2322
00:56:59,731 --> 00:57:00,940
And I was state Johnny Johnson,

2323
00:57:00,941 --> 00:57:01,751
who was the coach up there,

2324
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:02,584
right.

2325
00:57:02,590 --> 00:57:04,240
And myself and three other buddies,

2326
00:57:04,241 --> 00:57:05,860
Mike Wolf from American pickers.

2327
00:57:06,370 --> 00:57:08,080
Rustled with me that year up there.

2328
00:57:08,081 --> 00:57:08,914
Right.

2329
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:10,250
And he's actually a tough guy.

2330
00:57:10,251 --> 00:57:11,170
Lot of people don't realize it.

2331
00:57:11,171 --> 00:57:12,880
Mike Wolf's actually a really tough dude.

2332
00:57:13,210 --> 00:57:13,990
Um,

2333
00:57:13,990 --> 00:57:15,760
but to keep ourselves busy,

2334
00:57:16,510 --> 00:57:17,560
we would go,

2335
00:57:17,650 --> 00:57:18,880
all the wrestlers would go,

2336
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:19,810
and there was,

2337
00:57:19,810 --> 00:57:21,490
there was fields everywhere
next to the college.

2338
00:57:21,491 --> 00:57:23,380
It was small junior college
in the middle of nowhere.

2339
00:57:23,381 --> 00:57:24,214
Right.

2340
00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:28,240
So there was this huge Angus bull
in the field right by the college.

2341
00:57:28,241 --> 00:57:31,750
So we would go over there and the first
guy that could grab the bull's head

2342
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:33,011
would win the money.

2343
00:57:33,011 --> 00:57:34,000
We put money in the pot,

2344
00:57:34,001 --> 00:57:34,271
right?

2345
00:57:34,271 --> 00:57:35,350
So we're running around the,

2346
00:57:35,670 --> 00:57:36,340
the owner,

2347
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:37,090
the farm owner,

2348
00:57:37,090 --> 00:57:39,700
the farmer pulls up one time in
his pickup truck and he goes,

2349
00:57:39,701 --> 00:57:40,990
what do you idiots doing?

2350
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:42,080
We got,

2351
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:45,310
we put money in a pot and the first guy
that can grab the bolts head wins and

2352
00:57:45,370 --> 00:57:45,730
you know,

2353
00:57:45,730 --> 00:57:46,030
that's,

2354
00:57:46,030 --> 00:57:46,990
that's the game we're playing,

2355
00:57:46,991 --> 00:57:47,590
right?

2356
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:48,310
And he goes,

2357
00:57:48,310 --> 00:57:49,810
you got to stay off my property,

2358
00:57:49,811 --> 00:57:50,081
man,

2359
00:57:50,081 --> 00:57:51,310
knock this shit off.

2360
00:57:51,370 --> 00:57:54,880
And then we got to where the sheep would
always escape another farm and come

2361
00:57:54,881 --> 00:57:57,250
onto the lawn of the college.

2362
00:57:57,700 --> 00:57:59,830
And Mike Wolfe and I
got in trouble one day.

2363
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:01,301
We'd take these,

2364
00:58:01,301 --> 00:58:03,100
these rams and we'd smack
them in the forehead,

2365
00:58:03,101 --> 00:58:06,160
palm in the forehead to get them to jump
up on their back legs and try and smash

2366
00:58:06,161 --> 00:58:06,850
us.

2367
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:09,160
And then we'd sidestep them and
headlock him and throw him and stuff.

2368
00:58:09,161 --> 00:58:09,994
But that's,

2369
00:58:10,630 --> 00:58:12,190
that's what we were
doing for fun back then.

2370
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:12,990
So,

2371
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:13,823
uh,

2372
00:58:13,930 --> 00:58:14,441
Mike,

2373
00:58:14,441 --> 00:58:15,274
uh,

2374
00:58:15,790 --> 00:58:16,623
Mike Wolfe,

2375
00:58:17,050 --> 00:58:20,500
one of the ladies that worked in the
cafeteria sauce doing it and she goes,

2376
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:22,060
you boys leave those animals alone.

2377
00:58:22,061 --> 00:58:22,301
Quit.

2378
00:58:22,301 --> 00:58:23,021
Stop doing that.

2379
00:58:23,021 --> 00:58:23,261
Right.

2380
00:58:23,261 --> 00:58:24,094
That's cruel.

2381
00:58:24,190 --> 00:58:25,060
And it wasn't hurting him.

2382
00:58:25,070 --> 00:58:25,841
We were just having the phone.

2383
00:58:25,841 --> 00:58:26,920
We were born college kids,

2384
00:58:26,921 --> 00:58:27,640
right?

2385
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:28,473
And uh,

2386
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:29,890
I said,

2387
00:58:29,890 --> 00:58:30,131
yeah,

2388
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:31,660
but you should see what
squirrel does to them.

2389
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:34,990
And Squirrel was one of the basketball
players from east Saint Louis who played

2390
00:58:34,991 --> 00:58:36,070
on the basketball team up there.

2391
00:58:36,071 --> 00:58:37,720
And we had guys from Miami,

2392
00:58:37,721 --> 00:58:38,680
south side of Chicago,

2393
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:39,550
East St Louis,

2394
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:40,031
you know,

2395
00:58:40,031 --> 00:58:43,000
just tough ghetto kids
who got thrown into this,

2396
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:43,871
this,

2397
00:58:43,871 --> 00:58:44,240
uh,

2398
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:45,580
farm atmosphere.

2399
00:58:45,581 --> 00:58:47,500
It was totally foreign for them,

2400
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:49,450
but we made the joke,

2401
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:53,200
and this was a very religious
cafeteria lady and I said,

2402
00:58:53,201 --> 00:58:54,670
you should see what
squirrels doing to them.

2403
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,480
And the next day we came in for lunch.

2404
00:58:56,481 --> 00:58:59,530
She was scolding squirrel about
beastiality and he's looking at me.

2405
00:59:03,630 --> 00:59:04,600
So yeah,

2406
00:59:04,630 --> 00:59:05,441
that was good times.

2407
00:59:05,441 --> 00:59:06,274
Good Times Fan.

2408
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:06,551
Yeah.

2409
00:59:06,551 --> 00:59:08,650
That's a ridiculous thing
to do with your time.

2410
00:59:09,030 --> 00:59:10,060
We had nothing else to do.

2411
00:59:10,090 --> 00:59:10,840
I understand.

2412
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:14,190
You should find something
else until he needed somebody.

2413
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:15,070
Some guidance.

2414
00:59:15,130 --> 00:59:15,520
Well that's,

2415
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:16,900
that's the uh,

2416
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:18,310
hey warden Iowa,

2417
00:59:18,610 --> 00:59:20,320
which was right on the
South Dakota border,

2418
00:59:20,321 --> 00:59:21,110
tiny little town.

2419
00:59:21,110 --> 00:59:21,950
The college was there.

2420
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:27,640
And One night I went drinking and I got
in a fight with a bike gang and they

2421
00:59:27,861 --> 00:59:29,330
were beating me with pool cues.

2422
00:59:29,430 --> 00:59:30,540
But if that's not,

2423
00:59:30,970 --> 00:59:31,160
you know,

2424
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:32,030
whatever it happened.

2425
00:59:33,410 --> 00:59:34,340
But I had a guy,

2426
00:59:34,341 --> 00:59:37,130
a biker was at the urinal and I
walked into the bathroom and he goes,

2427
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:39,380
quit dragging your feet.

2428
00:59:39,950 --> 00:59:40,783
Eight man.

2429
00:59:41,330 --> 00:59:41,631
And I go,

2430
00:59:41,631 --> 00:59:41,841
you know,

2431
00:59:41,841 --> 00:59:43,820
people that mind their business
don't get the shit kicked out of him.

2432
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:45,013
Right?

2433
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:45,471
And he goes,

2434
00:59:45,471 --> 00:59:45,890
bring it.

2435
00:59:45,890 --> 00:59:47,210
So I crushed the toilet with him,

2436
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:47,781
right?

2437
00:59:47,781 --> 00:59:49,850
I beat his head on the
toilet and powder the toilet.

2438
00:59:50,530 --> 00:59:51,470
It's like roadhouse.

2439
00:59:51,530 --> 00:59:51,741
And,

2440
00:59:51,741 --> 00:59:56,270
but then the other bikers heard the
commotion and I came out of there and they

2441
00:59:56,271 --> 00:59:57,660
all started beating me with pool cues.

2442
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:59,930
And I was fighting my way out
of there and I made my way out.

2443
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:03,590
I got back to the school and my
scalp all split open and everywhere.

2444
01:00:03,591 --> 01:00:07,520
And my arms are beat to hell from
blocking pool cues and I lost my gold

2445
01:00:07,521 --> 01:00:07,911
necklace,

2446
01:00:07,911 --> 01:00:11,450
so I had to go down there the next day
to go back and get my frigging necklace.

2447
01:00:11,451 --> 01:00:14,960
It was a big rope chain necklace that my
girlfriend at the time of bought for me

2448
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:17,750
and I walked in and I go,

2449
01:00:17,751 --> 01:00:19,010
I lost my chain here last night.

2450
01:00:19,011 --> 01:00:19,611
And the owner goes,

2451
01:00:19,611 --> 01:00:19,791
yeah.

2452
01:00:19,791 --> 01:00:20,031
He goes,

2453
01:00:20,031 --> 01:00:21,680
you put five people in
the hospital last night.

2454
01:00:21,681 --> 01:00:21,891
He goes,

2455
01:00:21,891 --> 01:00:23,510
don't ever come back here again man.

2456
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:24,560
Don't,

2457
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:25,670
don't come back.

2458
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:28,580
This is so that's just
the way it was dealt.

2459
01:00:28,610 --> 01:00:29,300
The Iowa,

2460
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:30,133
that was Iowa.

2461
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:31,093
That's what we did for fun.

2462
01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:36,130
Has such a reputation for a tough
guys when it comes to wrestling.

2463
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:37,161
I mean the,

2464
01:00:37,161 --> 01:00:38,330
I will wrestlers,

2465
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:38,680
there's,

2466
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:39,500
it's like,

2467
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:42,650
you know like there's
like Thai kickboxers,

2468
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:43,970
Iowa wrestling.

2469
01:00:44,150 --> 01:00:45,380
It was always this thing.

2470
01:00:45,381 --> 01:00:48,980
It was almost synonymous with Iowa when
Gable was coaching the eyewear wrestling

2471
01:00:48,981 --> 01:00:52,640
team beat up the football team and the
basketball team on numerous occasions

2472
01:00:53,030 --> 01:00:54,680
he'd have to go get
those guys out of jail.

2473
01:00:55,070 --> 01:00:56,180
They just beat up the whole team.

2474
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:56,570
Well,

2475
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:57,590
I can only imagine,

2476
01:00:57,620 --> 01:00:57,831
you know,

2477
01:00:57,831 --> 01:01:00,740
if someone actually thought they were a
tough guy and they talked to those tough

2478
01:01:00,741 --> 01:01:01,180
guys,

2479
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:01,521
it's like,

2480
01:01:01,521 --> 01:01:01,701
well,

2481
01:01:01,701 --> 01:01:05,060
we've got to show you something because
you're going through this life with his

2482
01:01:05,061 --> 01:01:09,020
delusional perspective and a blue and
the Ed bannock and guys like that.

2483
01:01:09,470 --> 01:01:11,660
Just King Mueller back in those days,

2484
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:12,531
some very,

2485
01:01:12,531 --> 01:01:13,610
very scary wrestlers.

2486
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:16,670
I don't think people truly understand
the difference between them and regular

2487
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:17,504
human beings.

2488
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:18,110
I just don't,

2489
01:01:18,110 --> 01:01:19,080
I don't think they've ever expire.

2490
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:23,030
I think you have to like just lock
up with them to experience it.

2491
01:01:23,570 --> 01:01:24,530
The explosiveness,

2492
01:01:24,531 --> 01:01:25,480
the tendon strength,

2493
01:01:25,610 --> 01:01:28,460
just the power of the
sheer of just violence.

2494
01:01:28,461 --> 01:01:31,250
If those guys can bring in
a short burst of energy,

2495
01:01:31,251 --> 01:01:35,990
it's until you get used to it and you
see it all the time and in fighting a guy

2496
01:01:35,991 --> 01:01:39,560
who's never trained with guys
at that level of athleticism,

2497
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:44,390
right suddenly find themselves getting
mauled by a superior human being going,

2498
01:01:44,391 --> 01:01:45,150
Holy Shit,

2499
01:01:45,150 --> 01:01:48,530
I never had any idea a human
like this even existed.

2500
01:01:48,620 --> 01:01:48,771
Well,

2501
01:01:48,771 --> 01:01:50,300
you see it when you'll well fights.

2502
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:50,780
Yeah.

2503
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:51,051
When you,

2504
01:01:51,051 --> 01:01:51,270
well,

2505
01:01:51,270 --> 01:01:53,120
Romeo gets ahold of guys when DOL,

2506
01:01:53,121 --> 01:01:58,121
you're talking about a guy who metaled
in every single international competition

2507
01:01:58,131 --> 01:02:02,270
he ever and beat Cael Sanderson
when was was 18 years old,

2508
01:02:02,271 --> 01:02:02,600
right?

2509
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:03,050
Yeah.

2510
01:02:03,050 --> 01:02:03,920
That's a scary dude.

2511
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:04,760
Beat him twice.

2512
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:05,060
Yeah,

2513
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:08,230
he's a fucking monster and
when he gets a hold of guys,

2514
01:02:08,231 --> 01:02:09,920
he could see the way he rag dolls people.

2515
01:02:09,921 --> 01:02:10,161
You're like,

2516
01:02:10,161 --> 01:02:11,330
Holy Shit.

2517
01:02:11,770 --> 01:02:12,740
But that's what it is.

2518
01:02:12,741 --> 01:02:15,440
It's just this next level athleticism,

2519
01:02:15,441 --> 01:02:16,640
next level strength,

2520
01:02:16,670 --> 01:02:17,900
next level technique.

2521
01:02:18,230 --> 01:02:20,490
And then also just being

2522
01:02:20,730 --> 01:02:24,700
forged in the competition of
that Cuban Westling program.

2523
01:02:24,930 --> 01:02:27,210
Did you see the podcast
I had with him last week?

2524
01:02:27,270 --> 01:02:27,810
No.

2525
01:02:27,810 --> 01:02:32,010
I had him on last week with Joey Diaz
and Joey Diaz translated for him and they

2526
01:02:32,011 --> 01:02:33,050
went back and forth like,

2527
01:02:33,090 --> 01:02:33,630
Yo,

2528
01:02:33,630 --> 01:02:34,700
you always try to speak,

2529
01:02:34,770 --> 01:02:36,060
speak as much as he could in English.

2530
01:02:36,270 --> 01:02:38,690
And then Joey would sort of translate
the stuff that he couldn't write.

2531
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:39,680
He just detailed his,

2532
01:02:39,690 --> 01:02:44,130
his time in the system and the Cuban
wrestling system and how intense it was.

2533
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:44,670
I wouldn't,

2534
01:02:44,670 --> 01:02:45,091
I mean,

2535
01:02:45,091 --> 01:02:46,380
think about their communist country.

2536
01:02:46,860 --> 01:02:47,660
That's your ticket.

2537
01:02:47,660 --> 01:02:48,090
Yeah.

2538
01:02:48,090 --> 01:02:49,890
To at least leading a halfway decent life.

2539
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:50,790
We'll just to eat.

2540
01:02:51,190 --> 01:02:54,210
He was talking about the
difference between the way
the elite guys would eat in

2541
01:02:54,211 --> 01:02:55,650
ways where they would sleep.

2542
01:02:55,651 --> 01:02:56,790
They would get three meals a day,

2543
01:02:56,791 --> 01:02:57,830
the other guys would get to,

2544
01:02:58,220 --> 01:02:59,370
and the food would be better.

2545
01:02:59,371 --> 01:03:00,180
Everything would be better.

2546
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:01,200
That would motivate you to win.

2547
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:01,621
Yeah.

2548
01:03:01,621 --> 01:03:02,640
And they're all together.

2549
01:03:02,641 --> 01:03:03,211
That's the thing.

2550
01:03:03,211 --> 01:03:03,991
They're all trained together.

2551
01:03:03,991 --> 01:03:06,360
So the guys who want your
spot or right next to you,

2552
01:03:06,630 --> 01:03:07,411
everybody knows like,

2553
01:03:07,411 --> 01:03:07,561
Oh,

2554
01:03:07,561 --> 01:03:08,730
you got a hurt wrist.

2555
01:03:08,731 --> 01:03:09,241
They know.

2556
01:03:09,241 --> 01:03:10,140
Everybody knows everything.

2557
01:03:10,141 --> 01:03:10,740
Right?

2558
01:03:10,740 --> 01:03:11,101
And he's like,

2559
01:03:11,101 --> 01:03:13,200
that competition just makes you a machine.

2560
01:03:13,201 --> 01:03:14,790
And the guy that's eaten two meals a day,

2561
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:15,020
once,

2562
01:03:15,020 --> 01:03:15,840
three meals a day,

2563
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:16,201
fuck,

2564
01:03:16,201 --> 01:03:16,470
Yay.

2565
01:03:16,470 --> 01:03:17,140
Does.

2566
01:03:17,140 --> 01:03:17,973
Yeah.

2567
01:03:18,930 --> 01:03:19,291
Yeah.

2568
01:03:19,291 --> 01:03:19,830
And then,

2569
01:03:19,830 --> 01:03:21,060
and then on top of that,

2570
01:03:21,061 --> 01:03:23,130
you have these fucking
incredible genetics.

2571
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:23,641
I mean,

2572
01:03:23,641 --> 01:03:26,460
the Cubans have a unfucking
believable genetics.

2573
01:03:27,090 --> 01:03:27,621
It's just a,

2574
01:03:27,621 --> 01:03:28,680
an amazing pot.

2575
01:03:28,690 --> 01:03:29,523
But that's,

2576
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:33,960
that's really one of the more fascinating
things about competition is to see all

2577
01:03:33,961 --> 01:03:34,950
these variables.

2578
01:03:35,220 --> 01:03:38,490
And it's to see like when you think
you've reached this high level,

2579
01:03:38,491 --> 01:03:39,181
I'll look at this,

2580
01:03:39,181 --> 01:03:40,560
there's another level past that.

2581
01:03:40,780 --> 01:03:43,040
There's another level
passed that and let you get,

2582
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:48,080
you see guys who in no way shape or form
should be a champion or upper echelon

2583
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:50,100
athletically or genetically,

2584
01:03:50,101 --> 01:03:51,300
but they figured out how to do it.

2585
01:03:51,330 --> 01:03:51,661
Right,

2586
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:51,990
right,

2587
01:03:51,990 --> 01:03:52,560
right.

2588
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:53,580
Just super smart.

2589
01:03:53,690 --> 01:03:53,990
Yeah.

2590
01:03:53,990 --> 01:03:54,331
Yeah.

2591
01:03:54,331 --> 01:03:55,740
But you see a guy,

2592
01:03:56,060 --> 01:03:56,341
you know,

2593
01:03:56,341 --> 01:03:57,174
I would say,

2594
01:03:57,180 --> 01:03:57,390
you know,

2595
01:03:57,390 --> 01:03:58,290
if you were to see,

2596
01:03:58,890 --> 01:03:59,041
well,

2597
01:03:59,041 --> 01:03:59,850
let me think,

2598
01:03:59,850 --> 01:04:00,301
smiling,

2599
01:04:00,301 --> 01:04:00,601
Sam,

2600
01:04:00,601 --> 01:04:01,800
Alvin on the streets.

2601
01:04:01,830 --> 01:04:02,160
Right,

2602
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:02,401
right,

2603
01:04:02,401 --> 01:04:02,700
right.

2604
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:05,670
And you got in an argument with him for
whatever reason you think I'm going to

2605
01:04:05,671 --> 01:04:06,990
kick this guy's ass.

2606
01:04:07,020 --> 01:04:08,990
He's wearing a sweater
with a tie underneath it.

2607
01:04:09,650 --> 01:04:10,680
It looks like a car sale,

2608
01:04:10,681 --> 01:04:11,070
guys.

2609
01:04:11,070 --> 01:04:12,420
The guy's tougher than shit.

2610
01:04:12,750 --> 01:04:13,890
He's just would've never guessed.

2611
01:04:13,891 --> 01:04:14,671
You'd never guess.

2612
01:04:14,671 --> 01:04:14,821
Yeah.

2613
01:04:14,821 --> 01:04:15,690
There's a lot of those guys,

2614
01:04:15,691 --> 01:04:15,841
right?

2615
01:04:15,841 --> 01:04:16,530
Evan Dunham,

2616
01:04:16,530 --> 01:04:17,131
you'd never know.

2617
01:04:17,131 --> 01:04:17,640
You look at Evan,

2618
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:17,911
done them.

2619
01:04:17,911 --> 01:04:19,420
Looks like a nice gentleman.

2620
01:04:19,890 --> 01:04:21,000
I'll beat the fuck out of you.

2621
01:04:21,060 --> 01:04:22,020
And you just go home and go,

2622
01:04:22,021 --> 01:04:22,854
I'm never fighting the,

2623
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:24,210
this is just the stupid.

2624
01:04:24,510 --> 01:04:24,661
Yeah.

2625
01:04:24,661 --> 01:04:26,070
Well you'd learn that in Jujitsu too.

2626
01:04:26,071 --> 01:04:27,450
I remember when I first started training,

2627
01:04:27,650 --> 01:04:29,970
I would get choked out by guys
to just looked like nothing.

2628
01:04:29,990 --> 01:04:31,810
Compared to the weight 150 pounds.

2629
01:04:32,340 --> 01:04:32,550
Well,

2630
01:04:32,550 --> 01:04:32,880
the,

2631
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:37,880
especially now like I think now a Jujitsu
is really been a adopted by a lot of,

2632
01:04:40,350 --> 01:04:41,040
uh,

2633
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:41,970
like Eddie calls.

2634
01:04:41,971 --> 01:04:43,170
I'm like nervous acids,

2635
01:04:43,350 --> 01:04:43,800
right?

2636
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:48,300
Because they really are like these guys
who are just really smart or into the

2637
01:04:48,301 --> 01:04:50,780
technique and into the fact that it's,

2638
01:04:50,781 --> 01:04:53,100
it's a Jujitsu by a computer programmer.

2639
01:04:53,170 --> 01:04:53,910
Yeah.

2640
01:04:53,910 --> 01:04:54,420
Yeah.

2641
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:57,060
That level of thinking through
things and that's cool.

2642
01:04:57,220 --> 01:04:58,970
I've rolled with a lot of
guys like that and go this,

2643
01:04:59,510 --> 01:05:00,343
this is stupid.

2644
01:05:00,690 --> 01:05:01,440
This guy is,

2645
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:02,970
especially now with the leg lock game,

2646
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:03,930
with a leg lock game,

2647
01:05:03,931 --> 01:05:06,390
it seems like strength
is less of a factor.

2648
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:07,151
You know,

2649
01:05:07,151 --> 01:05:07,440
wouldn't,

2650
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:11,340
you guys are isolating legs and you're
constantly defending against that and

2651
01:05:11,341 --> 01:05:13,980
whatever strength that you do have in
your back and your core and your upper

2652
01:05:13,981 --> 01:05:14,460
body,

2653
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:15,990
you're not really getting
a chance to utilize it.

2654
01:05:15,990 --> 01:05:19,050
You're just trying to defend if
you don't understand the positions.

2655
01:05:19,051 --> 01:05:19,450
Right.

2656
01:05:19,450 --> 01:05:20,170
And they get,

2657
01:05:20,170 --> 01:05:20,891
they get deep,

2658
01:05:20,891 --> 01:05:22,810
they get a couple of steps
in on you and you're like,

2659
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:23,470
oof.

2660
01:05:23,470 --> 01:05:23,920
You know,

2661
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,570
it doesn't take a strong guy.

2662
01:05:25,571 --> 01:05:27,010
And I always loved leg locks.

2663
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:27,940
I love leg locks.

2664
01:05:27,941 --> 01:05:29,350
And the guy like Dave Manet,

2665
01:05:30,010 --> 01:05:30,850
Matt Hume,

2666
01:05:31,030 --> 01:05:33,040
those guys were all sick leg lockers,

2667
01:05:33,041 --> 01:05:33,340
right?

2668
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:33,790
Yeah,

2669
01:05:33,790 --> 01:05:34,580
sure.

2670
01:05:34,580 --> 01:05:35,560
Eric Paulson,

2671
01:05:35,650 --> 01:05:38,800
good leg lock or a lot of those guys
that were the catches catch can and the

2672
01:05:38,801 --> 01:05:39,370
Combo.

2673
01:05:39,370 --> 01:05:39,851
Who did?

2674
01:05:39,851 --> 01:05:42,100
I'm Matt Hume Wrestle in that.

2675
01:05:42,101 --> 01:05:46,300
Do you remember that one time were Peretti
put together a thing with Dan Gable

2676
01:05:46,301 --> 01:05:47,860
was the commentator with Peretti.

2677
01:05:47,861 --> 01:05:49,180
He went against an Olympic wrestler.

2678
01:05:49,181 --> 01:05:51,010
I'm pretty sure my Johnson Kenny Monday.

2679
01:05:51,011 --> 01:05:51,610
Kenny Monday,

2680
01:05:51,610 --> 01:05:52,360
I think it was Kenny mom.

2681
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:56,860
Cause either Kevin because Kevin Jackson
lost the Sherman Jackson loss to frank

2682
01:05:56,861 --> 01:05:57,490
shamrock.

2683
01:05:57,490 --> 01:05:58,000
No,

2684
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:58,471
that was you have,

2685
01:05:58,471 --> 01:06:00,790
so that was dance Severin no,

2686
01:06:00,791 --> 01:06:01,420
Dan,

2687
01:06:01,420 --> 01:06:03,460
Dan Henderson House to Frank.

2688
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:04,720
Frank got him in a foot lock.

2689
01:06:04,721 --> 01:06:05,021
Right,

2690
01:06:05,021 --> 01:06:05,400
right.

2691
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:05,620
Yeah,

2692
01:06:05,620 --> 01:06:06,453
yeah,

2693
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:07,391
yeah.

2694
01:06:07,391 --> 01:06:08,470
I think it was Kenny Monday.

2695
01:06:08,770 --> 01:06:12,070
That's when Kurt Angle was calling the
action and I was sitting next to Kurt

2696
01:06:12,070 --> 01:06:13,660
Angle and Kurt was asking me questions.

2697
01:06:13,661 --> 01:06:14,020
What's,

2698
01:06:14,020 --> 01:06:14,700
what's he doing?

2699
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:15,210
Right?

2700
01:06:15,210 --> 01:06:16,900
So what do you what to
say on the air and stuff,

2701
01:06:16,930 --> 01:06:17,500
right.

2702
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:18,333
Yeah.

2703
01:06:18,340 --> 01:06:19,510
That was an interesting thing.

2704
01:06:19,511 --> 01:06:20,770
That submission tournament.

2705
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:22,210
I thought it was great.

2706
01:06:22,210 --> 01:06:23,530
I thought if they were
to ever do it again,

2707
01:06:23,531 --> 01:06:23,980
I think,

2708
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:25,330
but they kind of do that now anyway.

2709
01:06:25,510 --> 01:06:26,470
They do do that now,

2710
01:06:26,471 --> 01:06:30,040
but for whatever reason it
doesn't get that much attention.

2711
01:06:30,041 --> 01:06:30,874
Although Eddie,

2712
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:33,400
Eddie bravos figured out a way to
give it a little bit more attention.

2713
01:06:33,401 --> 01:06:35,290
If he's seen combat Jujitsu a little bit,

2714
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:38,950
they're doing it basically like pankration
style slaps like open hand strikes.

2715
01:06:38,951 --> 01:06:39,670
Right.

2716
01:06:39,670 --> 01:06:40,420
And um,

2717
01:06:40,420 --> 01:06:40,780
you know,

2718
01:06:40,780 --> 01:06:41,410
it opens up,

2719
01:06:41,410 --> 01:06:41,651
it's,

2720
01:06:41,651 --> 01:06:44,290
it's also like what we were
talking about before with,

2721
01:06:44,291 --> 01:06:44,620
um,

2722
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:47,850
there's some stuff that you can get
away with an MMA because there's no head

2723
01:06:47,851 --> 01:06:48,400
buds.

2724
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:51,400
There's some stuff that you can get
away with another styles like in,

2725
01:06:51,401 --> 01:06:54,220
in kickbox even cause there is no
clinching and there's no elbows,

2726
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:54,640
right?

2727
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:56,650
There's all these different little things.

2728
01:06:56,710 --> 01:06:57,543
Well with,

2729
01:06:57,620 --> 01:06:58,900
with Jujitsu,

2730
01:06:58,990 --> 01:07:01,380
there's a lot of positions where a
guy could just smack you in the face.

2731
01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:02,550
You'd have to let go the lock.

2732
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:06,550
And now guys are doing that with combat
Jujitsu and it's a good intermediary

2733
01:07:06,551 --> 01:07:07,900
step between,

2734
01:07:07,930 --> 01:07:10,780
I think it's a good way to find out
if you're meant for MMA to that too.

2735
01:07:10,810 --> 01:07:11,140
Yeah,

2736
01:07:11,140 --> 01:07:11,491
yeah,

2737
01:07:11,491 --> 01:07:11,910
yeah,

2738
01:07:11,910 --> 01:07:12,190
yeah.

2739
01:07:12,190 --> 01:07:13,023
I find that he,

2740
01:07:13,090 --> 01:07:14,770
I've always found Eddie
really interesting.

2741
01:07:15,460 --> 01:07:16,293
He's a trip.

2742
01:07:16,330 --> 01:07:18,490
He's a trip and you can
tell he's a thinker,

2743
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:19,241
you know what I mean?

2744
01:07:19,241 --> 01:07:19,480
He's a,

2745
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:21,640
he's a very analytical guy,

2746
01:07:21,641 --> 01:07:24,490
very analytical grappler
with great flexibility.

2747
01:07:24,491 --> 01:07:26,040
I just always would watch them go,

2748
01:07:26,050 --> 01:07:27,640
this guy's fucking slick man.

2749
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:28,930
And he knows a lot of shit,

2750
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:30,250
especially when it comes to Jujitsu.

2751
01:07:30,310 --> 01:07:30,980
And I'm talking,

2752
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:31,241
you know,

2753
01:07:31,241 --> 01:07:31,490
I'm,

2754
01:07:31,490 --> 01:07:33,220
I'm gonna see him tomorrow morning.

2755
01:07:33,490 --> 01:07:34,030
Oh really?

2756
01:07:34,030 --> 01:07:34,670
What are you doing?

2757
01:07:34,670 --> 01:07:35,130
Uh,

2758
01:07:35,130 --> 01:07:35,380
you know,

2759
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:36,213
Sam triply?

2760
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:36,731
Sure.

2761
01:07:36,731 --> 01:07:37,770
No Sam very well.

2762
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:39,850
So I'm doing that show.

2763
01:07:40,490 --> 01:07:40,920
Um,

2764
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:41,111
and,

2765
01:07:41,111 --> 01:07:41,831
and he's going to be there.

2766
01:07:41,831 --> 01:07:45,280
I want him to explain flat earth to me
because he's not going to be able to,

2767
01:07:47,140 --> 01:07:47,801
I want to know.

2768
01:07:47,801 --> 01:07:48,970
But this is what it is.

2769
01:07:49,090 --> 01:07:52,030
Eddie thinks that everybody's lying,

2770
01:07:52,450 --> 01:07:54,520
that everybody and NASA
and the government,

2771
01:07:54,521 --> 01:07:55,360
and because of that,

2772
01:07:55,361 --> 01:07:59,020
I believe he has a blind spot and that
he lived there telling you the world's

2773
01:07:59,021 --> 01:07:59,381
around.

2774
01:07:59,381 --> 01:07:59,681
He's saying,

2775
01:07:59,681 --> 01:07:59,801
well,

2776
01:07:59,801 --> 01:08:00,520
it can't be round.

2777
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:00,970
Right.

2778
01:08:00,970 --> 01:08:02,290
And it's not a good way to think.

2779
01:08:02,380 --> 01:08:02,740
No,

2780
01:08:02,740 --> 01:08:05,320
but it's the same reason
why he's so good at Jujitsu.

2781
01:08:05,420 --> 01:08:09,400
It's cause he sees an idea and he just
pursues it and chases after it turns to

2782
01:08:09,410 --> 01:08:11,230
the right digits is like,

2783
01:08:11,380 --> 01:08:12,213
it's all,

2784
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:12,941
you know,

2785
01:08:12,941 --> 01:08:13,751
it's all quantified.

2786
01:08:13,751 --> 01:08:14,360
It's all right there.

2787
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:15,020
Two bodies.

2788
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:15,801
It's all very simple.

2789
01:08:15,801 --> 01:08:16,040
There's no

2790
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:16,630
mystery.

2791
01:08:16,630 --> 01:08:16,841
Right.

2792
01:08:16,841 --> 01:08:17,030
You know,

2793
01:08:17,030 --> 01:08:17,960
it's just a figure.

2794
01:08:17,961 --> 01:08:19,430
It's just figuring out a puzzle.

2795
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:20,270
Yeah.

2796
01:08:20,270 --> 01:08:22,940
But I can see how people get
that way because I was a guy who,

2797
01:08:24,470 --> 01:08:24,741
you know,

2798
01:08:24,741 --> 01:08:25,730
not to go off on a tangent,

2799
01:08:25,731 --> 01:08:27,140
but I think it's fun to think about.

2800
01:08:27,170 --> 01:08:31,700
In 1971 when I was a young
boy standing in line in Albia,

2801
01:08:31,701 --> 01:08:34,700
Iowa with my grandma and my mom when
the farm collapse was happening and when

2802
01:08:34,701 --> 01:08:36,230
Nixon took us off the gold standard,

2803
01:08:36,231 --> 01:08:37,064
right.

2804
01:08:37,130 --> 01:08:39,680
Shit fell apart for
the farmers right away.

2805
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:43,370
And my grandma was one of the first
people in line to get her money out of the

2806
01:08:43,371 --> 01:08:44,690
farmer's national bank in Albia,

2807
01:08:44,691 --> 01:08:45,524
Iowa.

2808
01:08:45,620 --> 01:08:46,221
And she got it out.

2809
01:08:46,221 --> 01:08:47,750
And I remember still to this day,

2810
01:08:47,751 --> 01:08:49,550
standing there and asking
my mom and my grandma,

2811
01:08:49,551 --> 01:08:50,600
what the hell is going on?

2812
01:08:50,601 --> 01:08:51,680
Why is this happening?

2813
01:08:51,681 --> 01:08:52,431
What's going on?

2814
01:08:52,431 --> 01:08:53,330
You could see the panic.

2815
01:08:53,690 --> 01:08:58,670
The farmers went for blocks right from
all around that part of Iowa and it just,

2816
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:02,420
I think that's what started the wheels
turning in my head about being a

2817
01:09:02,421 --> 01:09:03,320
contrarian thinker.

2818
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:09,160
There's real conspiracies and there's
real things where people misunderstand the

2819
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:10,310
actual facts.

2820
01:09:10,390 --> 01:09:10,910
Right?

2821
01:09:10,910 --> 01:09:11,960
Flatters not one of them.

2822
01:09:12,380 --> 01:09:13,180
No,

2823
01:09:13,180 --> 01:09:13,840
not,

2824
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:14,620
it's just not,

2825
01:09:14,620 --> 01:09:15,453
I mean,

2826
01:09:15,610 --> 01:09:16,780
there's so many stuff.

2827
01:09:16,781 --> 01:09:17,001
I mean,

2828
01:09:17,001 --> 01:09:20,570
looked snipers used the curvature of
the earth to calculate ballistics.

2829
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:21,170
Yeah.

2830
01:09:21,170 --> 01:09:21,591
It's just,

2831
01:09:21,591 --> 01:09:21,981
it's just,

2832
01:09:21,981 --> 01:09:22,814
it's a real thing,

2833
01:09:22,910 --> 01:09:23,180
right?

2834
01:09:23,180 --> 01:09:23,421
I mean,

2835
01:09:23,421 --> 01:09:24,710
there's plenty of shit that's not real,

2836
01:09:24,830 --> 01:09:25,850
but I want Eddie to tell me,

2837
01:09:26,270 --> 01:09:28,040
I want him to explain it
is going to be frustrating.

2838
01:09:29,180 --> 01:09:30,290
I don't know if I believe in anymore.

2839
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:31,550
He might've let it go by now.

2840
01:09:31,551 --> 01:09:32,450
I'm a hope and he did.

2841
01:09:32,570 --> 01:09:32,841
Right.

2842
01:09:32,841 --> 01:09:34,160
I don't talk to him about it anymore.

2843
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:34,911
I just,

2844
01:09:34,911 --> 01:09:38,240
we had a few conversations about it on
the podcast and initially he thought it

2845
01:09:38,241 --> 01:09:38,690
was stupid.

2846
01:09:38,690 --> 01:09:40,250
He thought the flat earth concept was too,

2847
01:09:40,251 --> 01:09:40,640
but,

2848
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:42,490
and then all of a sudden he
started being open minded to it.

2849
01:09:42,491 --> 01:09:42,830
I'm like,

2850
01:09:42,830 --> 01:09:44,090
what the fuck are you saying?

2851
01:09:44,300 --> 01:09:45,620
Like what the fuck are you saying?

2852
01:09:45,650 --> 01:09:46,483
This is crazy.

2853
01:09:46,940 --> 01:09:47,550
And he's like,

2854
01:09:47,550 --> 01:09:49,520
and he kept going to the
fake the moon landing.

2855
01:09:49,610 --> 01:09:50,990
They send me the same people.

2856
01:09:51,110 --> 01:09:51,480
Right.

2857
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:51,780
If,

2858
01:09:51,780 --> 01:09:52,640
if they did,

2859
01:09:52,910 --> 01:09:54,440
that was a long fucking time ago.

2860
01:09:54,441 --> 01:09:55,670
You're talking about people right now.

2861
01:09:55,820 --> 01:09:58,700
There's satellites all
over the world that they,

2862
01:09:58,850 --> 01:10:00,740
there's a lot of people that
think satellites are fake.

2863
01:10:01,100 --> 01:10:01,520
Um,

2864
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:03,200
I think anything's dinosaurs aren't real.

2865
01:10:04,130 --> 01:10:04,640
Yeah.

2866
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:05,120
Wow.

2867
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:05,540
Yeah.

2868
01:10:05,540 --> 01:10:07,250
You know what's interesting and I never,

2869
01:10:07,580 --> 01:10:11,020
and the first time I fought
in the UFC I went into things.

2870
01:10:11,021 --> 01:10:11,940
Dinosaurs or business.

2871
01:10:12,020 --> 01:10:12,620
Yeah.

2872
01:10:12,620 --> 01:10:13,453
It hurts.

2873
01:10:13,590 --> 01:10:14,423
Hurts my head.

2874
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:16,500
I went into the,

2875
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:19,130
the production trailer and my first UFC,

2876
01:10:19,131 --> 01:10:20,620
I wanted to see what
was going on in there.

2877
01:10:20,750 --> 01:10:20,991
Right.

2878
01:10:20,991 --> 01:10:21,380
That was,

2879
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:24,320
that always intrigued me
how TV was put together.

2880
01:10:24,321 --> 01:10:25,154
Right.

2881
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:28,190
And that was lucky enough to bring my
daughter to one of our broadcast with

2882
01:10:28,191 --> 01:10:30,710
access TV and Lonnie,

2883
01:10:30,770 --> 01:10:31,370
who's,

2884
01:10:31,370 --> 01:10:33,410
he's the expert to find the satellites.

2885
01:10:33,860 --> 01:10:35,000
He's got an APP on his phone.

2886
01:10:35,001 --> 01:10:36,260
If you ever seen guys do that.

2887
01:10:36,290 --> 01:10:36,650
No.

2888
01:10:36,650 --> 01:10:39,860
He has an app on his phone where he can
punch it in and do this across the sky.

2889
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:41,060
It's spot all the,

2890
01:10:41,230 --> 01:10:42,051
the satellites.

2891
01:10:42,051 --> 01:10:42,440
Right.

2892
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:42,710
Ah,

2893
01:10:42,710 --> 01:10:43,310
interesting.

2894
01:10:43,310 --> 01:10:45,180
So he knows how to dial into them.

2895
01:10:45,181 --> 01:10:46,010
Call Up.

2896
01:10:46,010 --> 01:10:46,281
No,

2897
01:10:46,281 --> 01:10:46,650
the,

2898
01:10:46,650 --> 01:10:48,350
the coordinates to turn the,

2899
01:10:48,410 --> 01:10:48,661
the,

2900
01:10:48,661 --> 01:10:51,830
the dish towards and lock onto
a percentage of the satellite,

2901
01:10:52,190 --> 01:10:52,430
you know,

2902
01:10:52,430 --> 01:10:54,050
receptor to get it being back down,

2903
01:10:54,051 --> 01:10:54,884
all that sort of stuff.

2904
01:10:55,130 --> 01:10:57,260
So he was teaching my daughter
how all that stuff was done.

2905
01:10:57,261 --> 01:10:58,270
And it was first time I'd ever seen,

2906
01:10:58,280 --> 01:10:58,551
it was like,

2907
01:10:58,551 --> 01:10:59,384
this was pretty,

2908
01:10:59,450 --> 01:11:00,410
pretty amazing stuff.

2909
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:01,401
But yeah,

2910
01:11:01,401 --> 01:11:04,550
you can see the curvature of the earth
and how the satellites are set across the

2911
01:11:04,551 --> 01:11:05,001
horizon.

2912
01:11:05,001 --> 01:11:05,390
Right?

2913
01:11:05,390 --> 01:11:05,541
Well,

2914
01:11:05,541 --> 01:11:06,710
you could track satellites.

2915
01:11:06,711 --> 01:11:07,131
The thing is,

2916
01:11:07,131 --> 01:11:08,630
these guys don't even
believe in satellites.

2917
01:11:08,930 --> 01:11:10,220
Here's what the problem is.

2918
01:11:10,610 --> 01:11:12,680
If someone has no,

2919
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:14,010
and they put

2920
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:16,170
together a video and that video,

2921
01:11:16,540 --> 01:11:18,780
they're articulate and they sound calm,

2922
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:23,900
they use big words and they show you
images that they're claiming show that the

2923
01:11:24,241 --> 01:11:25,021
earth is flat,

2924
01:11:25,021 --> 01:11:27,090
that there's an ice wall
outside of Antarctica,

2925
01:11:27,091 --> 01:11:28,560
and that the government
won't let you go there.

2926
01:11:28,710 --> 01:11:30,060
They start saying all these things,

2927
01:11:30,210 --> 01:11:31,560
if there's no one there,

2928
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:33,810
no like Neil degrasse Tyson type guy.

2929
01:11:33,811 --> 01:11:34,211
There he's go,

2930
01:11:34,211 --> 01:11:34,381
hey,

2931
01:11:34,381 --> 01:11:34,501
hey,

2932
01:11:34,501 --> 01:11:35,040
hey,

2933
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:35,790
no,

2934
01:11:35,790 --> 01:11:36,541
that's not true.

2935
01:11:36,541 --> 01:11:37,374
And here's why.

2936
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:40,290
And here's how we know and here's what
we found out and here's a test you can do

2937
01:11:40,291 --> 01:11:40,810
yourself.

2938
01:11:40,810 --> 01:11:41,850
Here's how you can figure it out,

2939
01:11:41,851 --> 01:11:42,030
right?

2940
01:11:42,030 --> 01:11:42,863
And here's Wiki,

2941
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:44,570
what you could find online and here.

2942
01:11:44,571 --> 01:11:47,610
And like for the longest time they were
trying to say that there was no full

2943
01:11:47,611 --> 01:11:48,780
pictures of the earth.

2944
01:11:49,020 --> 01:11:49,681
That the,

2945
01:11:49,681 --> 01:11:50,090
uh,

2946
01:11:50,090 --> 01:11:50,290
the,

2947
01:11:50,290 --> 01:11:50,730
the earth,

2948
01:11:50,730 --> 01:11:51,660
like every photo you see,

2949
01:11:51,661 --> 01:11:52,740
if the earth is a composite,

2950
01:11:52,890 --> 01:11:53,250
no,

2951
01:11:53,250 --> 01:11:55,770
does it fucking Japanese
satellite called the hemo Ari aid.

2952
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:56,940
It takes full,

2953
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:58,800
full images of the earth.

2954
01:11:58,801 --> 01:11:59,820
High resolution,

2955
01:11:59,821 --> 01:12:01,620
every 10 minutes you can go Google it,

2956
01:12:01,780 --> 01:12:02,700
you can watch them.

2957
01:12:02,820 --> 01:12:03,250
There's the,

2958
01:12:03,250 --> 01:12:04,560
NASA has one too.

2959
01:12:04,930 --> 01:12:09,630
There's giant photos of the fucking earth
from 22,000 miles out or whatever the

2960
01:12:09,631 --> 01:12:10,464
hell it is.

2961
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:11,753
It's real.

2962
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:12,660
It's fucking real.

2963
01:12:12,660 --> 01:12:15,480
Like there's a lot of shit to think about.

2964
01:12:15,481 --> 01:12:16,440
That's fascinating.

2965
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:17,550
That's not one of them,

2966
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:19,200
like that's been solved.

2967
01:12:19,820 --> 01:12:20,653
You know,

2968
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:23,080
I'm into the geopolitical
and domestic policy shit.

2969
01:12:23,410 --> 01:12:23,740
Right.

2970
01:12:23,740 --> 01:12:24,573
That's where I,

2971
01:12:25,690 --> 01:12:28,120
I was drawn more about
what's really going on,

2972
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:28,750
you know,

2973
01:12:28,750 --> 01:12:29,590
behind the news,

2974
01:12:29,591 --> 01:12:30,424
all that sort of stuff.

2975
01:12:30,430 --> 01:12:31,690
This is bullshit.

2976
01:12:31,691 --> 01:12:34,990
And I was lucky to train a lot of law
enforcement and then military high level

2977
01:12:34,991 --> 01:12:37,900
military and get connected
to Intel guys who go,

2978
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:38,441
pat,

2979
01:12:38,441 --> 01:12:39,460
we need to talk like,

2980
01:12:39,730 --> 01:12:39,941
no,

2981
01:12:39,941 --> 01:12:40,930
you're completely off.

2982
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:42,670
Let me explain things to you.

2983
01:12:42,671 --> 01:12:43,360
Right.

2984
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:43,721
It was like,

2985
01:12:43,721 --> 01:12:44,201
as far as like,

2986
01:12:44,201 --> 01:12:45,340
what were you completely off about?

2987
01:12:45,380 --> 01:12:46,213
Well,

2988
01:12:46,750 --> 01:12:49,930
I can tell you what I was right about
when I called up my buddy and I go,

2989
01:12:49,931 --> 01:12:50,764
hey,

2990
01:12:51,140 --> 01:12:52,000
four years ago,

2991
01:12:52,001 --> 01:12:52,631
whatever it was,

2992
01:12:52,631 --> 01:12:53,670
four and a half years ago,

2993
01:12:53,671 --> 01:12:54,504
I go,

2994
01:12:54,730 --> 01:12:55,541
we're funding Isis,

2995
01:12:55,541 --> 01:12:56,020
aren't we?

2996
01:12:56,020 --> 01:12:56,231
He goes,

2997
01:12:56,231 --> 01:12:56,350
well,

2998
01:12:56,350 --> 01:12:57,130
yeah.

2999
01:12:57,130 --> 01:12:57,500
Yeah.

3000
01:12:57,500 --> 01:12:57,720
They,

3001
01:12:57,720 --> 01:12:58,540
those the go between guy.

3002
01:12:58,540 --> 01:12:59,373
What do you think?

3003
01:12:59,420 --> 01:13:02,770
I'll news for Isis friggin Al Shabaab.

3004
01:13:03,310 --> 01:13:04,270
What are you fucking think?

3005
01:13:04,390 --> 01:13:07,720
So why did they fund
isis to take out Syria?

3006
01:13:08,290 --> 01:13:09,011
It was obvious,

3007
01:13:09,011 --> 01:13:09,280
right?

3008
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:10,720
The mujahideen in Afghanistan,

3009
01:13:10,980 --> 01:13:12,310
the frigging take out the Russians,

3010
01:13:12,311 --> 01:13:15,910
but the way I looked at it was
when that was going on funding,

3011
01:13:15,911 --> 01:13:17,830
the Mujahideen was to bankrupt Russia,

3012
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:18,450
right?

3013
01:13:18,450 --> 01:13:18,760
Right.

3014
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:20,710
We wanted them to go
bankrupt and it worked.

3015
01:13:20,711 --> 01:13:22,140
Reagan was,

3016
01:13:22,150 --> 01:13:23,350
was a genius in that park.

3017
01:13:23,590 --> 01:13:26,770
The diabolical part of course is Russian
and American both fighting over the

3018
01:13:26,771 --> 01:13:27,940
resources of Afghanistan.

3019
01:13:28,210 --> 01:13:28,780
Right.

3020
01:13:28,780 --> 01:13:30,950
But Isis was just theirs.

3021
01:13:31,690 --> 01:13:32,501
That's some weird shit.

3022
01:13:32,501 --> 01:13:37,450
When you have a 50,000 man army just
appear out of nowhere with professional

3023
01:13:37,460 --> 01:13:42,460
cameramen and editors and producers and
directors making the high level films

3024
01:13:44,501 --> 01:13:45,251
that they were putting out,

3025
01:13:45,251 --> 01:13:48,490
where it's every three seconds they're
cut in different angles professionally

3026
01:13:48,491 --> 01:13:50,770
put together films of people being burned.

3027
01:13:50,771 --> 01:13:51,604
I go,

3028
01:13:51,820 --> 01:13:52,700
this is this,

3029
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:53,560
this is too weird.

3030
01:13:53,650 --> 01:13:54,251
This is too weird.

3031
01:13:54,251 --> 01:13:55,750
You know when people stop talking about,

3032
01:13:55,930 --> 01:13:57,490
do you remember when they blame

3033
01:13:57,810 --> 01:14:00,150
Ghazi on some bullshit video,

3034
01:14:00,690 --> 01:14:02,100
some video that someone made,

3035
01:14:02,101 --> 01:14:02,380
right?

3036
01:14:02,380 --> 01:14:05,130
What was it like the tears of
Muslims or something like that,

3037
01:14:05,131 --> 01:14:06,000
or I forget that.

3038
01:14:06,001 --> 01:14:07,070
Nobody even knew it existed.

3039
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:08,190
Nobody knew it existed.

3040
01:14:08,220 --> 01:14:09,810
And everybody knew it was bullshit.

3041
01:14:09,990 --> 01:14:10,920
And they were pushing that as a,

3042
01:14:11,350 --> 01:14:12,160
like this is what

3043
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:13,660
was the motivation behind.

3044
01:14:13,930 --> 01:14:14,711
And everybody was like,

3045
01:14:14,711 --> 01:14:16,750
what have you had Perato on your show?

3046
01:14:16,780 --> 01:14:17,290
No.

3047
01:14:17,290 --> 01:14:18,123
Who's this?

3048
01:14:19,020 --> 01:14:19,810
[inaudible],

3049
01:14:19,810 --> 01:14:20,321
what's his name?

3050
01:14:20,321 --> 01:14:21,190
Former seal.

3051
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:22,050
What's his name?

3052
01:14:22,050 --> 01:14:22,883
Toronto.

3053
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:24,051
Rol Name.

3054
01:14:24,051 --> 01:14:24,930
T a presumptive.

3055
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:26,560
His last name's Perato,

3056
01:14:26,890 --> 01:14:28,150
but I think he's a former seal.

3057
01:14:28,151 --> 01:14:30,640
There were several seals obviously
that ran to try and help,

3058
01:14:31,030 --> 01:14:31,280
uh,

3059
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:33,460
the ambassador and some of the other guys,

3060
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:34,840
Toronto lived through it.

3061
01:14:35,470 --> 01:14:36,430
But you know,

3062
01:14:36,490 --> 01:14:36,680
he,

3063
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:38,030
when he talks about it,

3064
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:39,513
it,

3065
01:14:39,970 --> 01:14:42,670
they're moving massive amounts
of weapons through Libya,

3066
01:14:43,090 --> 01:14:43,930
into Syria,

3067
01:14:43,931 --> 01:14:45,430
into other places in the Middle East.

3068
01:14:45,431 --> 01:14:45,710
Right.

3069
01:14:45,710 --> 01:14:47,470
There's just a fact that it's happening.

3070
01:14:48,220 --> 01:14:50,470
And that whole thing going down,

3071
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:54,940
I think was a way for them to just cover
it all up in a remove and erase any

3072
01:14:54,941 --> 01:14:55,870
people that knew about it.

3073
01:14:56,020 --> 01:14:56,853
You know what I'm saying?

3074
01:14:57,100 --> 01:14:59,410
That's the way it spells out to me.

3075
01:14:59,411 --> 01:15:00,910
Pretty obvious because it's documented.

3076
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:03,280
It's all documented that
weapons were being moved.

3077
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:04,120
And if you look at,

3078
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:05,673
um,

3079
01:15:05,890 --> 01:15:09,070
arsenal of weapons
manufacturing in Bulgaria.

3080
01:15:09,580 --> 01:15:12,460
So Leon had goats and shy
by who I had on my podcast,

3081
01:15:12,490 --> 01:15:13,540
the conspiracy farm.

3082
01:15:13,541 --> 01:15:14,374
Right.

3083
01:15:14,740 --> 01:15:17,170
She was the Bulgarian reporter
that got fired for it.

3084
01:15:17,171 --> 01:15:18,130
Now you had a podcast?

3085
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:18,420
Yeah,

3086
01:15:18,420 --> 01:15:19,570
it's called the conspiracy farm.

3087
01:15:19,660 --> 01:15:19,811
Oh,

3088
01:15:19,811 --> 01:15:20,200
okay.

3089
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:20,900
Yeah.

3090
01:15:20,900 --> 01:15:21,700
I want to Google it.

3091
01:15:21,700 --> 01:15:22,100
We don't,

3092
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:23,470
we don't start the conspiracies.

3093
01:15:23,471 --> 01:15:24,370
We just add the water,

3094
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:27,340
but I've got to click the name.

3095
01:15:27,341 --> 01:15:27,491
Yeah.

3096
01:15:27,491 --> 01:15:28,540
My cohosts Jeffrey Wilson.

3097
01:15:28,541 --> 01:15:29,800
He's a really bright guy.

3098
01:15:30,670 --> 01:15:30,971
Cool.

3099
01:15:30,971 --> 01:15:31,804
Cool game.

3100
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:32,051
Yeah.

3101
01:15:32,051 --> 01:15:33,220
So we have fun with tee shirts.

3102
01:15:33,221 --> 01:15:36,220
Can I wear conspiracy theory that was
going to bring you on and why he shipped

3103
01:15:36,300 --> 01:15:37,180
me once and I will.

3104
01:15:37,270 --> 01:15:37,660
I will.

3105
01:15:37,660 --> 01:15:38,050
Okay.

3106
01:15:38,050 --> 01:15:38,620
Yes.

3107
01:15:38,620 --> 01:15:39,310
So it's a bar.

3108
01:15:39,310 --> 01:15:40,143
It's a barn.

3109
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:45,490
It's a barn with a satellite and the
satellite dish down next to the bar.

3110
01:15:45,550 --> 01:15:45,641
Oh,

3111
01:15:45,641 --> 01:15:46,210
that's hilarious.

3112
01:15:46,210 --> 01:15:46,720
That's it.

3113
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:46,930
Right.

3114
01:15:46,930 --> 01:15:48,160
And he's doing it out of Iowa.

3115
01:15:48,610 --> 01:15:49,000
Oh yeah,

3116
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:49,540
yeah,

3117
01:15:49,540 --> 01:15:49,990
yeah.

3118
01:15:49,990 --> 01:15:50,351
It's pretty,

3119
01:15:50,351 --> 01:15:50,890
yeah,

3120
01:15:50,890 --> 01:15:51,723
that's right.

3121
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:52,160
But,

3122
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:52,993
um,

3123
01:15:53,470 --> 01:15:54,700
arsenal weapons manufacturing,

3124
01:15:54,701 --> 01:15:55,570
she exposed,

3125
01:15:55,571 --> 01:15:57,900
the Isis fighters took here.

3126
01:15:57,940 --> 01:15:59,290
I took her to their weapons cache.

3127
01:15:59,291 --> 01:15:59,411
It was,

3128
01:15:59,411 --> 01:16:02,620
and there was massive
amounts of artillery rounds,

3129
01:16:02,621 --> 01:16:04,060
depleted uranium stuff,

3130
01:16:04,550 --> 01:16:05,710
small arms stuff,

3131
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:07,450
and it was all arsenal weapons,

3132
01:16:07,451 --> 01:16:08,710
Bulgarian weapons,

3133
01:16:08,740 --> 01:16:09,573
right?

3134
01:16:10,420 --> 01:16:12,190
And she got fired for exposing it.

3135
01:16:12,250 --> 01:16:13,031
Now at the same time,

3136
01:16:13,031 --> 01:16:14,050
silk way airlines,

3137
01:16:14,051 --> 01:16:15,910
who is a Azerbaijani airline,

3138
01:16:16,390 --> 01:16:17,290
they're manifest,

3139
01:16:17,291 --> 01:16:22,291
got exposed by Bulgarian anonymous with
manifest of all the white phosphorous

3140
01:16:22,781 --> 01:16:23,201
weapons,

3141
01:16:23,201 --> 01:16:24,280
the depleted uranium,

3142
01:16:24,281 --> 01:16:25,480
our artillery rounds,

3143
01:16:25,481 --> 01:16:26,530
all these shipments,

3144
01:16:26,531 --> 01:16:28,810
massive shipments going into Turkey,

3145
01:16:28,811 --> 01:16:29,621
going into Libya,

3146
01:16:29,621 --> 01:16:31,480
going into the Ukraine,

3147
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:32,350
right?

3148
01:16:32,350 --> 01:16:35,560
We're a bunch of shit was going down
there and every one of those places who

3149
01:16:35,561 --> 01:16:35,921
showed up,

3150
01:16:35,921 --> 01:16:36,290
the broker,

3151
01:16:36,290 --> 01:16:37,123
the deals,

3152
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:38,553
John Mccain,

3153
01:16:39,010 --> 01:16:39,760
Whoa,

3154
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:40,593
John Mccain,

3155
01:16:40,660 --> 01:16:41,493
right?

3156
01:16:41,710 --> 01:16:42,700
And look,

3157
01:16:42,701 --> 01:16:43,600
we can't prove it,

3158
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:47,830
but there's people telling
me that potentially there's
an offshore company that

3159
01:16:47,831 --> 01:16:51,190
owns a big percentage of arsenal
weapons manufacturing in Bulgaria,

3160
01:16:51,310 --> 01:16:51,940
right?

3161
01:16:51,940 --> 01:16:53,530
So that's the kind of stuff I'm going in.

3162
01:16:54,070 --> 01:16:55,900
I'm into who's who's causing it?

3163
01:16:55,901 --> 01:16:56,830
Why are they causing it?

3164
01:16:57,400 --> 01:16:58,210
The truth,

3165
01:16:58,210 --> 01:16:59,230
I'm just a truth seeker.

3166
01:16:59,410 --> 01:16:59,580
Right,

3167
01:16:59,580 --> 01:16:59,700
right.

3168
01:16:59,700 --> 01:17:01,000
Would you seem like that kind of guy?

3169
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:02,060
For sure.

3170
01:17:02,060 --> 01:17:06,610
Do don't you think that that stuff is
exposed at a level that's never been

3171
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:11,780
possible before because of the Internet
and that these people are probably used

3172
01:17:11,781 --> 01:17:15,020
to operating in a certain way that they'd
been doing for decades and now they're

3173
01:17:15,021 --> 01:17:15,890
having to adjust.

3174
01:17:16,570 --> 01:17:17,150
Yeah.

3175
01:17:17,150 --> 01:17:17,560
Well,

3176
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:21,860
and when people like you just doing
these podcasts and talking about it,

3177
01:17:22,010 --> 01:17:25,790
which opens the minds of other people
and has them thinking about it,

3178
01:17:25,820 --> 01:17:26,110
we,

3179
01:17:26,110 --> 01:17:26,430
you know,

3180
01:17:26,430 --> 01:17:28,440
w w who are the people
screaming the most of the,

3181
01:17:28,441 --> 01:17:28,891
I wasn't,

3182
01:17:28,891 --> 01:17:29,210
uh,

3183
01:17:29,210 --> 01:17:30,680
I wasn't even a Trump supporter.

3184
01:17:31,270 --> 01:17:31,551
Right.

3185
01:17:31,551 --> 01:17:32,450
I'm a rand Paul Guy.

3186
01:17:32,451 --> 01:17:33,830
You've got to fucking Rand Paul Shirt on,

3187
01:17:33,890 --> 01:17:34,080
right?

3188
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:34,970
The Ron Paul Guy,

3189
01:17:35,180 --> 01:17:39,170
you've got to teach him take down
defense off of a one a lawnmower.

3190
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:40,033
Right.

3191
01:17:40,220 --> 01:17:42,680
So you got blindsided in his defense,

3192
01:17:42,681 --> 01:17:43,010
right?

3193
01:17:43,010 --> 01:17:43,341
Yeah.

3194
01:17:43,341 --> 01:17:45,990
But it was at about
this neighborhood tack.

3195
01:17:45,991 --> 01:17:47,180
Those neighbors alluded tech.

3196
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:47,991
Right.

3197
01:17:47,991 --> 01:17:48,710
Good Times.

3198
01:17:48,710 --> 01:17:49,071
You know,

3199
01:17:49,071 --> 01:17:49,480
but,

3200
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:49,880
uh,

3201
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:52,370
it's a risky thing to do live
right next to a guy on a,

3202
01:17:52,371 --> 01:17:52,830
tag them.

3203
01:17:52,830 --> 01:17:53,240
Right.

3204
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:54,830
Like you're fucking burning the bridge.

3205
01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:57,890
I don't even know what kind of
sentence that guy got though.

3206
01:17:57,950 --> 01:17:58,440
I don't,

3207
01:17:58,440 --> 01:17:59,720
I haven't kept up on that,

3208
01:17:59,721 --> 01:18:00,830
but that was given sentence.

3209
01:18:00,831 --> 01:18:02,420
Yet during the presidential run,

3210
01:18:02,421 --> 01:18:04,010
I was given speeches for Rand Paul,

3211
01:18:04,011 --> 01:18:05,570
a couple of them to introduce him.

3212
01:18:05,571 --> 01:18:08,930
So I give a speech and then bringing them
out and I got to know him a little bit

3213
01:18:08,931 --> 01:18:09,764
better in Iowa.

3214
01:18:10,010 --> 01:18:10,450
Yeah.

3215
01:18:10,450 --> 01:18:10,880
Yeah.

3216
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:11,660
Amazing Dude.

3217
01:18:11,660 --> 01:18:12,730
We had great conversations.

3218
01:18:12,740 --> 01:18:13,730
I'm a big Fan of his dad.

3219
01:18:13,850 --> 01:18:14,360
Yeah.

3220
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:14,990
Yeah.

3221
01:18:14,990 --> 01:18:15,381
So,

3222
01:18:15,381 --> 01:18:15,800
uh,

3223
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:19,940
but the people that are yelling at the
most now about Trump and all the other

3224
01:18:19,941 --> 01:18:20,774
stuff,

3225
01:18:21,380 --> 01:18:23,600
you wonder what they're guilty of,

3226
01:18:23,810 --> 01:18:24,080
right.

3227
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:25,340
The deep state is just,

3228
01:18:25,610 --> 01:18:28,780
it is a way of doing business right there.

3229
01:18:28,810 --> 01:18:29,810
Smash and grab.

3230
01:18:30,190 --> 01:18:30,830
Um,

3231
01:18:30,830 --> 01:18:34,580
there's pay the play smash and grab his
me as somebody who is very powerful in

3232
01:18:34,581 --> 01:18:35,300
government,

3233
01:18:35,300 --> 01:18:36,560
going after an industry,

3234
01:18:36,950 --> 01:18:37,670
crushing it,

3235
01:18:37,670 --> 01:18:38,780
ruining that stock.

3236
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:40,310
And then my buddies by the company,

3237
01:18:40,580 --> 01:18:44,510
right when the stock collapses and then
bringing it back up like the Gi bill for

3238
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:46,250
a University of Memphis,

3239
01:18:46,430 --> 01:18:47,061
we go after it.

3240
01:18:47,061 --> 01:18:50,600
No longer will there be any
GI bill money put toward that.

3241
01:18:50,601 --> 01:18:52,490
The stock goes from 100 down to $3.

3242
01:18:52,790 --> 01:18:54,350
Obama's buddy goes in and buys it,

3243
01:18:54,380 --> 01:18:55,010
then they go,

3244
01:18:55,010 --> 01:18:55,221
wow,

3245
01:18:55,221 --> 01:18:56,960
we're going to allow GI
money to go back into it.

3246
01:18:56,961 --> 01:18:58,100
Now stock goes back up.

3247
01:18:58,190 --> 01:18:58,790
Right.

3248
01:18:58,790 --> 01:19:00,260
That's the kind of shit that's going on.

3249
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:00,810
It's,

3250
01:19:00,810 --> 01:19:01,970
it's some bad stuff.

3251
01:19:01,971 --> 01:19:03,940
And we just do our best to follow it.

3252
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:04,641
Educate people.

3253
01:19:04,641 --> 01:19:05,510
And we have a lot of people will say,

3254
01:19:05,511 --> 01:19:05,821
you're,

3255
01:19:05,821 --> 01:19:06,230
you're not,

3256
01:19:06,230 --> 01:19:07,310
you're wearing a tin foil hat.

3257
01:19:07,460 --> 01:19:08,900
But we just talking about Jamie,

3258
01:19:08,930 --> 01:19:09,400
about,

3259
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:09,650
uh,

3260
01:19:09,650 --> 01:19:14,650
something that you'd seen
about politicians being
exempt from insider trading

3261
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:16,273
rules.

3262
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:19,100
Someone on Twitter.

3263
01:19:19,101 --> 01:19:19,581
I couldn't,

3264
01:19:19,581 --> 01:19:20,391
I'll find the name later.

3265
01:19:20,391 --> 01:19:20,601
But,

3266
01:19:20,601 --> 01:19:21,230
uh,

3267
01:19:21,230 --> 01:19:22,790
if this guy,

3268
01:19:22,850 --> 01:19:23,571
he told me about this guy,

3269
01:19:23,571 --> 01:19:24,710
his name is Peter Schweizer.

3270
01:19:24,711 --> 01:19:26,400
He's a Stanford per secret empire.

3271
01:19:26,410 --> 01:19:27,243
So that's the book.

3272
01:19:27,330 --> 01:19:28,430
That's the book you want to,

3273
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:30,300
he wrote Clinton cash also.

3274
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:32,690
There's another book that
he hit me up to about.

3275
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:33,050
Yeah.

3276
01:19:33,050 --> 01:19:34,010
But this is the one that had,

3277
01:19:34,260 --> 01:19:35,190
have you had him on your show?

3278
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:35,840
And I have not.

3279
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:36,720
That's a guy that had been here.

3280
01:19:36,970 --> 01:19:41,460
I would love to have them on
how the American political
class a hides corruption

3281
01:19:41,461 --> 01:19:42,960
and enriches family and friends.

3282
01:19:43,380 --> 01:19:44,213
Yeah.

3283
01:19:44,220 --> 01:19:44,851
Without a doubt.

3284
01:19:44,851 --> 01:19:45,180
There's,

3285
01:19:45,180 --> 01:19:46,020
that Shit's real.

3286
01:19:46,150 --> 01:19:46,350
Yeah,

3287
01:19:46,350 --> 01:19:47,850
without a doubt that shit's going on.

3288
01:19:47,851 --> 01:19:48,684
I mean,

3289
01:19:48,690 --> 01:19:49,523
look,

3290
01:19:49,590 --> 01:19:51,480
we were just talking about this recently,

3291
01:19:51,481 --> 01:19:55,140
about how half of what it is to be
president and is to get yourself into a

3292
01:19:55,141 --> 01:19:56,550
position where after you're out,

3293
01:19:56,551 --> 01:19:58,860
you can make these crazy
speeches for these bankers.

3294
01:19:58,861 --> 01:19:59,970
Like why is that?

3295
01:20:00,350 --> 01:20:00,860
Like,

3296
01:20:00,860 --> 01:20:01,291
I mean it's,

3297
01:20:01,291 --> 01:20:02,790
it's almost like our man,

3298
01:20:02,791 --> 01:20:02,920
I,

3299
01:20:02,920 --> 01:20:03,060
you,

3300
01:20:03,060 --> 01:20:07,620
I told you there was a time when a good
friend of mine who was an agent me at

3301
01:20:07,621 --> 01:20:10,920
the time got me involved because of
all the years in MMA and martial arts,

3302
01:20:10,921 --> 01:20:14,220
I've met people from all over the world
who had eventually moved in the piece up

3303
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:18,060
positions of power in government
or cities or this or that.

3304
01:20:18,510 --> 01:20:19,171
And so they said,

3305
01:20:19,171 --> 01:20:23,490
we want you to help us get our foot
in the door to sell waste to energy

3306
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:24,353
projects.

3307
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:25,670
So it was basically a,

3308
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:28,380
a facility that bonds anything garbage.

3309
01:20:28,470 --> 01:20:28,681
I mean,

3310
01:20:28,681 --> 01:20:31,380
you can burn tires and the
thing at low oxygen levels,

3311
01:20:31,381 --> 01:20:32,790
so the emissions are very low,

3312
01:20:32,940 --> 01:20:34,290
but that generates electricity,

3313
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:35,100
right?

3314
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:38,400
And in Europe it was
everybody from the city,

3315
01:20:38,670 --> 01:20:39,390
uh,

3316
01:20:39,390 --> 01:20:42,360
province that contrary
and the European Union,

3317
01:20:42,390 --> 01:20:44,040
everybody wanted a piece of the projects.

3318
01:20:44,100 --> 01:20:44,820
Right.

3319
01:20:44,820 --> 01:20:48,060
That's just the way they do business
in Europe and South America and other

3320
01:20:48,061 --> 01:20:48,894
places like that.

3321
01:20:49,620 --> 01:20:52,320
They have to have a different model
for it here for the corruption.

3322
01:20:52,321 --> 01:20:52,531
Right.

3323
01:20:52,531 --> 01:20:55,410
They just do things differently
here and that's just the way it is.

3324
01:20:55,411 --> 01:20:58,260
They've made adjustments and either way
they're going to find their way around

3325
01:20:58,261 --> 01:20:58,740
it.

3326
01:20:58,740 --> 01:20:59,130
Yeah.

3327
01:20:59,130 --> 01:21:02,580
The idea that there's no
corruption is ridiculous.

3328
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:03,090
Right?

3329
01:21:03,090 --> 01:21:04,200
No one thinks that.

3330
01:21:04,230 --> 01:21:08,310
So it's how much corruption is there and
how many people are out there exposing

3331
01:21:08,311 --> 01:21:10,560
it and putting their neck
out there to expose it.

3332
01:21:10,561 --> 01:21:12,930
That's a big part of the problem
because if you really know about it,

3333
01:21:13,110 --> 01:21:15,360
that means you're probably
entrenched in the system too.

3334
01:21:15,450 --> 01:21:16,020
Yeah.

3335
01:21:16,020 --> 01:21:17,530
And the cognitive dissonance of the,

3336
01:21:17,700 --> 01:21:22,700
the citizenry of knowing that Hillary
Clinton and a few other people sold,

3337
01:21:24,150 --> 01:21:24,391
you know,

3338
01:21:24,391 --> 01:21:25,350
the document just came out.

3339
01:21:25,351 --> 01:21:27,690
It was 15 million kilograms,

3340
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:31,830
15 million kilograms of depleted uranium,

3341
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:32,713
yellow cake.

3342
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:33,833
Right.

3343
01:21:34,020 --> 01:21:35,490
Sold to the Russians.

3344
01:21:35,730 --> 01:21:38,910
At what point in any part of
a discussion on any planet,

3345
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:44,240
is it okay to sell your enemy 15
million kilograms of frigging uranium?

3346
01:21:44,370 --> 01:21:46,340
What was the justification behind it?

3347
01:21:46,540 --> 01:21:48,630
They agreed that this is a fact.

3348
01:21:48,900 --> 01:21:50,060
This is what's a fact?

3349
01:21:50,240 --> 01:21:50,721
It's a fact.

3350
01:21:50,721 --> 01:21:51,120
Agreed.

3351
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:51,631
I mean there's this,

3352
01:21:51,631 --> 01:21:53,640
is there any dispute that this is a fact?

3353
01:21:54,030 --> 01:21:54,240
No.

3354
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:55,073
There is no,

3355
01:21:55,140 --> 01:21:57,230
there's no they,

3356
01:21:57,500 --> 01:21:59,010
but they sit there and use the excuse.

3357
01:21:59,030 --> 01:21:59,580
Well,

3358
01:21:59,580 --> 01:22:02,070
there was eight other people
that had to sign off on this.

3359
01:22:02,190 --> 01:22:02,640
Right?

3360
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:03,473
What does that mean?

3361
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:04,460
Right,

3362
01:22:04,460 --> 01:22:06,870
but it was suddenly that company,

3363
01:22:07,020 --> 01:22:10,710
suddenly that company
invests $145 million in the,

3364
01:22:10,711 --> 01:22:11,940
in the Clinton Foundation.

3365
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:12,541
Yeah.

3366
01:22:12,541 --> 01:22:13,530
That's a big problem.

3367
01:22:13,531 --> 01:22:16,920
That Clinton Foundation is fucking insane
and all these people that were blind

3368
01:22:16,921 --> 01:22:18,900
supporters of Hillary that
didn't look at that like,

3369
01:22:19,260 --> 01:22:20,093
how do you not,

3370
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:22,020
how do you not find a
giant problem with that?

3371
01:22:22,050 --> 01:22:22,400
Right.

3372
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:23,233
It's,

3373
01:22:23,290 --> 01:22:24,960
and that book by
Schweitzer talks about it,

3374
01:22:25,650 --> 01:22:27,360
he goes in detail about that stuff.

3375
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:27,660
Yeah.

3376
01:22:27,660 --> 01:22:28,081
I'm sure.

3377
01:22:28,081 --> 01:22:28,690
How's this sobriety?

3378
01:22:28,690 --> 01:22:31,950
I'm surprised that that's what that was
just going to say after the Clinton cash

3379
01:22:31,951 --> 01:22:32,581
to the Russians.

3380
01:22:32,581 --> 01:22:34,020
Do Clinton cash was bad enough.

3381
01:22:34,021 --> 01:22:34,890
This one's even worse.

3382
01:22:34,891 --> 01:22:35,970
I'm surprised he's not dead.

3383
01:22:36,420 --> 01:22:38,310
I wonder how many people
are actually reading it.

3384
01:22:38,340 --> 01:22:38,980
You know,

3385
01:22:38,980 --> 01:22:39,421
I just,

3386
01:22:39,421 --> 01:22:42,150
I feel like they think that there's always
going to be a certain amount of that

3387
01:22:42,151 --> 01:22:44,670
stuff out there and they just
tolerate it and they just,

3388
01:22:44,671 --> 01:22:46,950
as long as it's not really
fucking up their business,

3389
01:22:46,951 --> 01:22:47,641
cause it's not,

3390
01:22:47,641 --> 01:22:49,230
the politicians are still allowing it.

3391
01:22:49,530 --> 01:22:52,230
Law enforcement still allowing it
and no one's really going after them.

3392
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:53,251
It makes you wonder,

3393
01:22:53,251 --> 01:22:56,880
like if Hillary had actually gotten into
the White House and she faced the same

3394
01:22:56,881 --> 01:22:59,360
scrutiny that Trump is facing
right now over the Russian pros,

3395
01:22:59,361 --> 01:23:01,830
we know none of this would
be uncovered had she won.

3396
01:23:01,890 --> 01:23:02,101
Right,

3397
01:23:02,101 --> 01:23:02,460
right,

3398
01:23:02,460 --> 01:23:02,621
right.

3399
01:23:02,621 --> 01:23:03,040
I know that.

3400
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:03,780
Right.

3401
01:23:03,780 --> 01:23:05,530
All of this stuff would
have been swept the rug.

3402
01:23:05,550 --> 01:23:05,830
Yeah.

3403
01:23:05,830 --> 01:23:06,620
Most likely.

3404
01:23:06,620 --> 01:23:08,640
And all this stuff with McCabe and uh,

3405
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:09,940
uh,

3406
01:23:09,940 --> 01:23:14,940
struck and page and call me and all
these people of going out of their way to

3407
01:23:15,371 --> 01:23:18,670
try and derail Trump to
get these FISA court,

3408
01:23:18,820 --> 01:23:20,230
frigging spa surveillance,

3409
01:23:20,231 --> 01:23:25,231
frigging warrants to spy on a president
elect and then a sitting president.

3410
01:23:25,540 --> 01:23:26,373
Are you kidding me?

3411
01:23:26,770 --> 01:23:28,240
At what point is our people not,

3412
01:23:28,750 --> 01:23:30,370
not charged with treason for that?

3413
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:31,713
Right.

3414
01:23:32,260 --> 01:23:33,093
When

3415
01:23:34,810 --> 01:23:35,470
they were [inaudible],

3416
01:23:35,470 --> 01:23:38,440
they were doing this spine before
he ever won the presidency.

3417
01:23:39,010 --> 01:23:41,260
Don't you think that if he was doing
something wrong with the Russians,

3418
01:23:41,261 --> 01:23:43,210
they would have frigging
made it mainstream news and,

3419
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:44,770
and bustled him for it?

3420
01:23:45,250 --> 01:23:45,521
Yeah,

3421
01:23:45,521 --> 01:23:49,270
there's for sure some dummies and his
staff that made some inappropriate

3422
01:23:49,271 --> 01:23:50,320
meetings and had some,

3423
01:23:50,350 --> 01:23:50,621
I mean,

3424
01:23:50,621 --> 01:23:52,180
they definitely had some intentions.

3425
01:23:52,330 --> 01:23:52,601
Well,

3426
01:23:52,601 --> 01:23:53,920
but they had something on him.

3427
01:23:53,950 --> 01:23:55,360
The way I look at it as this,

3428
01:23:55,480 --> 01:23:56,110
I mean,

3429
01:23:56,110 --> 01:23:57,580
if you win the presidency,

3430
01:23:58,180 --> 01:24:00,430
I'm going to send
whoever is underneath me.

3431
01:24:00,431 --> 01:24:01,270
If I'm the president,

3432
01:24:01,750 --> 01:24:04,750
we have to have meetings with diplomats
from other countries to make the

3433
01:24:04,751 --> 01:24:05,560
transition.

3434
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:05,861
That's,

3435
01:24:05,861 --> 01:24:06,610
that's part of the,

3436
01:24:06,610 --> 01:24:07,480
that's part of the deal,

3437
01:24:07,481 --> 01:24:08,080
right?

3438
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:08,950
It really is.

3439
01:24:08,980 --> 01:24:09,730
That goes on.

3440
01:24:09,730 --> 01:24:10,960
That's just the way it is.

3441
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:12,340
But that's not what they're talking about.

3442
01:24:12,341 --> 01:24:13,810
They're talking about
before the presidency.

3443
01:24:13,811 --> 01:24:17,560
They're talking about having
meetings with Russians long before,

3444
01:24:17,650 --> 01:24:17,891
right.

3445
01:24:17,891 --> 01:24:19,600
Where they had planned
this whole thing out.

3446
01:24:20,110 --> 01:24:21,130
Like they got enough.

3447
01:24:21,131 --> 01:24:21,910
They're all dirty.

3448
01:24:21,910 --> 01:24:22,510
They've got nothing.

3449
01:24:22,510 --> 01:24:23,060
They got nothing.

3450
01:24:23,060 --> 01:24:24,400
I mean like if they had something new,

3451
01:24:24,401 --> 01:24:25,360
it would be out there.

3452
01:24:25,940 --> 01:24:28,390
It's that projection and
diversion and everything else.

3453
01:24:28,391 --> 01:24:31,900
Because you know the Podesta's we're
doing lobbying for the biggest friggin

3454
01:24:31,901 --> 01:24:33,040
Russian bank in the world.

3455
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:33,461
Right?

3456
01:24:33,461 --> 01:24:33,760
Right.

3457
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:36,460
In Washington DC that it never comes up.

3458
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:39,650
It's almost like there's too many
things to pay attention to that.

3459
01:24:39,660 --> 01:24:41,170
It's like they did everything.

3460
01:24:41,290 --> 01:24:42,260
They just how you,

3461
01:24:42,261 --> 01:24:43,120
how do you keep up?

3462
01:24:43,810 --> 01:24:44,320
How do you,

3463
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:45,400
how do you corral it?

3464
01:24:45,401 --> 01:24:45,830
All,

3465
01:24:45,830 --> 01:24:50,530
all the corruption for the stock market
to natural resources to everything.

3466
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:50,800
Right.

3467
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:51,141
It's almost,

3468
01:24:51,141 --> 01:24:52,300
there's too many things to take,

3469
01:24:52,301 --> 01:24:53,080
pay attention to.

3470
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:53,480
Yeah.

3471
01:24:53,480 --> 01:24:53,780
It's,

3472
01:24:53,780 --> 01:24:54,581
it's mind boggling.

3473
01:24:54,581 --> 01:24:56,110
It's like a giant room full of spaghetti.

3474
01:24:56,620 --> 01:24:57,130
Yeah.

3475
01:24:57,130 --> 01:24:57,970
And you're in the middle of it.

3476
01:24:58,140 --> 01:24:59,230
Not just doing this.

3477
01:24:59,650 --> 01:25:01,240
It's fucking exciting way to put it.

3478
01:25:01,660 --> 01:25:02,620
That is what it's like.

3479
01:25:02,650 --> 01:25:03,040
Yeah.

3480
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:05,620
It does that to your brain when
you tried to comprehend all of it.

3481
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:06,491
When you,

3482
01:25:06,491 --> 01:25:08,260
when we do shows and we
talk about this stuff,

3483
01:25:08,290 --> 01:25:09,123
it's,

3484
01:25:09,370 --> 01:25:10,030
it's mind boggling.

3485
01:25:10,030 --> 01:25:11,020
How many episodes have you done?

3486
01:25:11,410 --> 01:25:12,700
We've only done like 50 so far,

3487
01:25:12,730 --> 01:25:14,680
but we've got listeners in 130 countries.

3488
01:25:14,681 --> 01:25:15,460
So we're doing pretty good.

3489
01:25:15,460 --> 01:25:16,310
That's nice work site.

3490
01:25:16,370 --> 01:25:18,490
Well you get more now for sure.

3491
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:19,840
Well cause you're kicking ass.

3492
01:25:19,841 --> 01:25:20,320
Thank you.

3493
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:22,660
Well we're gonna I mean promoting it here.

3494
01:25:22,690 --> 01:25:23,170
Right here.

3495
01:25:23,170 --> 01:25:24,010
Conspiracy farm.

3496
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:25,810
Go download it.

3497
01:25:25,990 --> 01:25:26,823
Check it out.

3498
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:27,221
Um,

3499
01:25:27,221 --> 01:25:28,840
so when you started this out,

3500
01:25:28,841 --> 01:25:29,591
what was the intention?

3501
01:25:29,591 --> 01:25:31,030
Just to something you're interested in?

3502
01:25:31,180 --> 01:25:31,481
You know,

3503
01:25:31,481 --> 01:25:33,760
I did Jeffery's podcast,

3504
01:25:34,030 --> 01:25:34,930
it's me speaking to you.

3505
01:25:34,930 --> 01:25:37,630
And at the very end of it it
was three conspiracy questions.

3506
01:25:37,690 --> 01:25:38,523
True or false,

3507
01:25:38,590 --> 01:25:39,160
right.

3508
01:25:39,160 --> 01:25:39,550
Okay.

3509
01:25:39,550 --> 01:25:39,911
And I said,

3510
01:25:39,911 --> 01:25:41,200
can I elaborate on them though?

3511
01:25:41,590 --> 01:25:43,390
Cause it might be something
that I've actually researched.

3512
01:25:43,391 --> 01:25:43,601
He goes,

3513
01:25:43,601 --> 01:25:43,751
yeah,

3514
01:25:43,751 --> 01:25:44,021
sure.

3515
01:25:44,021 --> 01:25:44,620
So we,

3516
01:25:44,620 --> 01:25:45,453
at the end of it,

3517
01:25:46,120 --> 01:25:46,571
he asked me,

3518
01:25:46,571 --> 01:25:47,590
I forget what the questions were,

3519
01:25:47,591 --> 01:25:49,540
but after we were done,

3520
01:25:49,541 --> 01:25:49,721
I go,

3521
01:25:49,721 --> 01:25:50,200
Hey,

3522
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:53,440
I've always wanted to do this podcast
and I want to call it the conspiracy farm

3523
01:25:53,830 --> 01:25:56,830
and I want to talk about
geopolitical domestic policy stuff.

3524
01:25:56,990 --> 01:25:58,270
Unless anything goes,

3525
01:25:58,271 --> 01:25:59,104
I love it man.

3526
01:25:59,140 --> 01:25:59,561
He's like,

3527
01:25:59,561 --> 01:26:00,050
yeah,

3528
01:26:00,050 --> 01:26:00,460
let's,

3529
01:26:00,460 --> 01:26:01,293
let's do it.

3530
01:26:01,420 --> 01:26:02,201
Absolutely.

3531
01:26:02,201 --> 01:26:04,190
So we've had great guests,

3532
01:26:04,210 --> 01:26:04,750
you know,

3533
01:26:04,750 --> 01:26:05,720
a couple of navy seals,

3534
01:26:05,721 --> 01:26:08,180
former Spetsnaz terrorist hunter.

3535
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:09,050
Um,

3536
01:26:09,050 --> 01:26:11,390
well if you're going to
do Sam Tripoli's podcast,

3537
01:26:11,480 --> 01:26:12,440
tin foil hat,

3538
01:26:13,160 --> 01:26:16,160
just understand that it's a different
kind of conspiracy theory podcasts.

3539
01:26:16,460 --> 01:26:18,890
It's like his big foot psychic.

3540
01:26:19,430 --> 01:26:20,640
Like those kind of questions.

3541
01:26:21,610 --> 01:26:22,443
You're going,

3542
01:26:22,660 --> 01:26:23,493
oh dear God.

3543
01:26:23,630 --> 01:26:25,620
And expect to get a
contact high from the room.

3544
01:26:25,940 --> 01:26:29,330
I always wanted to ask you about that
George Saint Pierre stuff with Ufos.

3545
01:26:29,900 --> 01:26:30,740
I think its head trauma.

3546
01:26:31,190 --> 01:26:31,760
Yeah.

3547
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:32,210
Yeah.

3548
01:26:32,210 --> 01:26:32,810
Where did he,

3549
01:26:32,810 --> 01:26:34,610
did he have sex with this hot green check?

3550
01:26:34,670 --> 01:26:35,503
Maybe did,

3551
01:26:35,510 --> 01:26:36,590
but if I had a gas,

3552
01:26:36,620 --> 01:26:40,190
the way he was describing things is
very similar to the way people describe

3553
01:26:40,191 --> 01:26:42,650
things when they've experienced
successive head trauma.

3554
01:26:42,710 --> 01:26:43,040
Really?

3555
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:43,311
Yeah.

3556
01:26:43,311 --> 01:26:44,450
Because he missed his time.

3557
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:46,550
He's memory's not not good.

3558
01:26:46,900 --> 01:26:50,270
He'll get home and then he'll let have
groceries that he bought and left in his

3559
01:26:50,271 --> 01:26:51,590
trunk and not even realize it.

3560
01:26:51,590 --> 01:26:53,930
And they will go out to his trunk
and the rotten and he's like,

3561
01:26:53,931 --> 01:26:55,700
I don't even remember going to this door.

3562
01:26:55,830 --> 01:26:56,380
Wow.

3563
01:26:56,380 --> 01:26:57,150
And you know,

3564
01:26:57,150 --> 01:26:58,100
so he's got,

3565
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:01,220
I think he's got this idea that this,

3566
01:27:01,250 --> 01:27:03,350
these glitches in his mind,

3567
01:27:04,220 --> 01:27:07,880
it's not a fucking coincidence that
the guy got punched in the head.

3568
01:27:07,881 --> 01:27:10,520
I think they did a stat
before the Bisping fight.

3569
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:16,120
I think it was more than 800 times you
got hit in the head and his UFC career.

3570
01:27:16,431 --> 01:27:17,940
Forget about all the gym training.

3571
01:27:18,460 --> 01:27:19,520
Forget about all the other stuff.

3572
01:27:19,550 --> 01:27:19,761
Right.

3573
01:27:19,761 --> 01:27:21,350
And forget about the
fights outside the UFC.

3574
01:27:21,351 --> 01:27:25,120
Did he had before he got into the
UFC when he was in Tko remember?

3575
01:27:25,210 --> 01:27:25,820
Yeah.

3576
01:27:25,820 --> 01:27:29,060
So he's experienced a lot of head trauma.

3577
01:27:29,270 --> 01:27:33,020
One of the symptoms of head trauma
is memory loss issues and mean.

3578
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:33,770
Um,

3579
01:27:33,770 --> 01:27:35,600
and Hendricks hit him hard a lot.

3580
01:27:35,630 --> 01:27:35,871
Yes,

3581
01:27:35,871 --> 01:27:36,440
he did.

3582
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:36,741
Yeah.

3583
01:27:36,741 --> 01:27:38,120
And he's only one guy that hit him hard.

3584
01:27:38,121 --> 01:27:38,241
I mean,

3585
01:27:38,241 --> 01:27:39,230
a lot of guys hit him hard.

3586
01:27:39,260 --> 01:27:41,270
Matt Serra scrambled is fucking brain.

3587
01:27:41,500 --> 01:27:41,931
I mean,

3588
01:27:41,931 --> 01:27:45,410
a lot of guys hit him hard and
that's just outside of sparring.

3589
01:27:45,411 --> 01:27:45,561
I mean,

3590
01:27:45,561 --> 01:27:49,010
that's us outside of everything else that
he's done sparring with Rory Mcdonald

3591
01:27:49,011 --> 01:27:51,620
and Wonderboy and all the other
guys that he had a spar with.

3592
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:52,250
Yeah,

3593
01:27:52,250 --> 01:27:55,250
I think that's most likely what it is.

3594
01:27:55,730 --> 01:27:57,200
People who have been,

3595
01:27:57,350 --> 01:27:59,000
who've experienced a lot of head trauma,

3596
01:27:59,030 --> 01:28:01,490
that's one of the real
problems with it is um,

3597
01:28:02,100 --> 01:28:02,933
um,

3598
01:28:03,980 --> 01:28:04,311
what does,

3599
01:28:04,311 --> 01:28:05,780
what does the dude from the Chicago bears,

3600
01:28:05,781 --> 01:28:06,650
that famous guy,

3601
01:28:06,780 --> 01:28:07,613
that

3602
01:28:08,780 --> 01:28:10,080
quarterback from the bears fall?

3603
01:28:10,090 --> 01:28:10,640
Mcmann?

3604
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:11,210
Yes.

3605
01:28:11,210 --> 01:28:13,320
Mcmahon was on the cover of sports
illustrated talking about it,

3606
01:28:13,530 --> 01:28:14,930
but he'll be in the middle of his,

3607
01:28:14,931 --> 01:28:15,530
um,

3608
01:28:15,530 --> 01:28:17,540
his living room holding these keys.

3609
01:28:17,950 --> 01:28:19,760
He had no idea how it's
keys got in his hand,

3610
01:28:19,820 --> 01:28:20,780
doesn't know where he's going.

3611
01:28:20,900 --> 01:28:21,220
Wow.

3612
01:28:21,220 --> 01:28:21,980
Where am I going?

3613
01:28:21,980 --> 01:28:22,131
Like,

3614
01:28:22,131 --> 01:28:23,390
why am I standing there holding my keys?

3615
01:28:23,690 --> 01:28:24,590
You just forget.

3616
01:28:24,740 --> 01:28:25,141
Stop.

3617
01:28:25,141 --> 01:28:25,640
Scary.

3618
01:28:25,640 --> 01:28:25,911
Yeah,

3619
01:28:25,911 --> 01:28:27,260
there's really skin actions.

3620
01:28:27,290 --> 01:28:27,411
Well,

3621
01:28:27,411 --> 01:28:29,000
that's why it's been
so impressive that you,

3622
01:28:29,150 --> 01:28:30,380
with your long fight career,

3623
01:28:30,381 --> 01:28:32,080
you kickbox you box dude.

3624
01:28:32,120 --> 01:28:32,451
You know,

3625
01:28:32,451 --> 01:28:33,770
you had a lot of MMA fights.

3626
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:36,770
I think I learned early on with the
kickboxing and boxing and I looked at the

3627
01:28:36,771 --> 01:28:38,750
older guys and listen
to them talk and went,

3628
01:28:39,290 --> 01:28:40,280
I don't want to be that guy.

3629
01:28:40,460 --> 01:28:41,960
So I started paying attention to defense.

3630
01:28:41,961 --> 01:28:45,140
I started watching films on
great boxers with great defense,

3631
01:28:45,530 --> 01:28:46,101
footwork,

3632
01:28:46,101 --> 01:28:46,934
head movement.

3633
01:28:47,060 --> 01:28:47,361
You know,

3634
01:28:47,361 --> 01:28:48,500
all that sort of stuff and just,

3635
01:28:49,090 --> 01:28:49,923
and I,

3636
01:28:49,950 --> 01:28:51,260
and it was the key.

3637
01:28:51,261 --> 01:28:53,090
I never got hit with
anything I didn't see.

3638
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:54,650
I think you have sturdy jeans too.

3639
01:28:54,651 --> 01:28:55,011
You've got them.

3640
01:28:55,011 --> 01:28:56,330
Croatian gene helps.

3641
01:28:56,390 --> 01:28:57,070
I'm sure it helps.

3642
01:28:57,070 --> 01:28:59,150
So I'm the smallest
Croatian on the planet.

3643
01:29:00,710 --> 01:29:01,401
When you run in,

3644
01:29:01,401 --> 01:29:02,300
the Croatians

3645
01:29:02,300 --> 01:29:02,941
are all huge,

3646
01:29:02,941 --> 01:29:03,900
like Cinco Cro,

3647
01:29:03,901 --> 01:29:04,830
cop type character,

3648
01:29:04,831 --> 01:29:05,310
steep,

3649
01:29:05,310 --> 01:29:05,671
steep,

3650
01:29:05,671 --> 01:29:07,670
Emile say choose a bear of a human being.

3651
01:29:07,830 --> 01:29:08,280
Right.

3652
01:29:08,280 --> 01:29:09,113
Super.

3653
01:29:09,150 --> 01:29:09,810
But that's just so,

3654
01:29:09,810 --> 01:29:12,660
have you ever seen the Olympic
water polo team from Croatia?

3655
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:13,150
No.

3656
01:29:13,150 --> 01:29:15,390
What can scariest dudes
on the planet are going?

3657
01:29:15,430 --> 01:29:16,290
All massive.

3658
01:29:16,291 --> 01:29:16,621
Six,

3659
01:29:16,621 --> 01:29:18,270
eight guys that just will drown you.

3660
01:29:18,540 --> 01:29:19,410
What happened to you?

3661
01:29:19,411 --> 01:29:24,030
There was a time where someone claimed
that you had neck surgery and you didn't

3662
01:29:24,060 --> 01:29:26,340
like a doctor said something about it.

3663
01:29:26,640 --> 01:29:29,610
I was training for a fight with
frank Trigg outside of the UFC.

3664
01:29:30,930 --> 01:29:34,530
It was the first round warm enough and
I get hit with a left hook and my neck

3665
01:29:34,531 --> 01:29:37,470
crunched and my left arm dropped
and wouldn't work anymore.

3666
01:29:38,600 --> 01:29:39,150
I went,

3667
01:29:39,150 --> 01:29:39,983
fuck,

3668
01:29:40,270 --> 01:29:41,850
this just wouldn't lift at all.

3669
01:29:41,851 --> 01:29:42,270
It was done.

3670
01:29:42,270 --> 01:29:43,103
It was dead.

3671
01:29:43,110 --> 01:29:44,160
Kitten move your hand?

3672
01:29:44,220 --> 01:29:44,461
No,

3673
01:29:44,461 --> 01:29:45,210
everything was dead.

3674
01:29:45,210 --> 01:29:45,750
Wow.

3675
01:29:45,750 --> 01:29:46,920
So how long did that last?

3676
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:47,161
It was,

3677
01:29:47,161 --> 01:29:47,761
well here,

3678
01:29:47,761 --> 01:29:48,594
I'll tell you,

3679
01:29:48,780 --> 01:29:50,130
that was the end of the first round.

3680
01:29:50,131 --> 01:29:51,030
I got cracked with it,

3681
01:29:51,031 --> 01:29:51,864
right?

3682
01:29:51,870 --> 01:29:53,420
And I go,

3683
01:29:53,430 --> 01:29:53,610
all right,

3684
01:29:53,610 --> 01:29:54,720
let's pick it up the second round.

3685
01:29:55,560 --> 01:29:57,390
And I hit him with like four or five,

3686
01:29:57,391 --> 01:29:58,260
right hands in a row.

3687
01:29:58,261 --> 01:29:59,220
Cause that's all I could do.

3688
01:29:59,580 --> 01:30:02,340
And it crushed his nose and he had to
have surgery because I was so pissed off

3689
01:30:02,341 --> 01:30:02,850
because I,

3690
01:30:02,850 --> 01:30:03,000
I,

3691
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:03,930
he blasted me.

3692
01:30:03,950 --> 01:30:04,280
Right,

3693
01:30:04,280 --> 01:30:04,550
right.

3694
01:30:04,550 --> 01:30:06,330
And I don't think it was
necessarily malicious,

3695
01:30:06,331 --> 01:30:08,100
but we were still warming
up and he cranked.

3696
01:30:08,101 --> 01:30:08,411
I left,

3697
01:30:08,411 --> 01:30:08,880
took on me,

3698
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:09,713
it was bad.

3699
01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:12,980
So over time everything started to
atrophy on this side of the body and

3700
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:15,330
everything started falling
apart and it was very painful.

3701
01:30:15,750 --> 01:30:18,120
And I went to a
neurosurgeon and got an MRI.

3702
01:30:18,180 --> 01:30:19,200
Neurosurgeon goes,

3703
01:30:20,310 --> 01:30:20,581
he goes,

3704
01:30:20,581 --> 01:30:21,310
your spinal cord,

3705
01:30:21,310 --> 01:30:21,610
your,

3706
01:30:21,610 --> 01:30:22,760
your disc exploded.

3707
01:30:22,761 --> 01:30:25,800
It exploded into your spinal cord and
almost separate it against the other side

3708
01:30:25,801 --> 01:30:26,700
of your spinal canal.

3709
01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:28,380
And he goes to make things worse.

3710
01:30:28,381 --> 01:30:29,220
You have so much to know.

3711
01:30:29,221 --> 01:30:30,900
So there's no fluid in there.

3712
01:30:30,901 --> 01:30:32,310
There's no spinal canal.

3713
01:30:32,730 --> 01:30:36,420
It's all scar tissue crushing your
spinal cord everywhere surgically.

3714
01:30:36,510 --> 01:30:37,343
Right?

3715
01:30:37,410 --> 01:30:38,570
So you're in you.

3716
01:30:38,730 --> 01:30:41,040
This was bound to happen
over all the years of abuse.

3717
01:30:41,041 --> 01:30:42,060
People wrenching on your neck,

3718
01:30:42,061 --> 01:30:43,050
punching you and everything else.

3719
01:30:43,051 --> 01:30:44,730
It just eventually gave way.

3720
01:30:45,900 --> 01:30:46,540
So he said,

3721
01:30:46,540 --> 01:30:47,520
you have to have surgery.

3722
01:30:47,550 --> 01:30:48,420
You're Christopher Reeves.

3723
01:30:48,421 --> 01:30:50,070
If you don't like you fall off,

3724
01:30:50,310 --> 01:30:51,210
you fall off a ladder,

3725
01:30:51,211 --> 01:30:51,930
you're done.

3726
01:30:51,930 --> 01:30:53,280
Like you have to have surgery.

3727
01:30:53,281 --> 01:30:53,671
And I said,

3728
01:30:53,671 --> 01:30:53,851
no,

3729
01:30:53,851 --> 01:30:54,684
I'm not going to do it.

3730
01:30:54,950 --> 01:30:56,340
Talk to another neurosurgeon.

3731
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:57,300
He said the same thing.

3732
01:30:57,301 --> 01:31:01,170
Then I talked to my cousin
at John Hopkins and he goes,

3733
01:31:01,650 --> 01:31:02,970
you're truly a moron.

3734
01:31:02,971 --> 01:31:03,930
You have to have surgery.

3735
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:04,351
And I said,

3736
01:31:04,351 --> 01:31:04,651
fuck you.

3737
01:31:04,651 --> 01:31:05,430
I'm not going to do it.

3738
01:31:05,430 --> 01:31:08,040
So three guys tell you
three medical experts.

3739
01:31:08,040 --> 01:31:09,280
So I rehabbed and like,

3740
01:31:09,390 --> 01:31:10,650
I got this to come back.

3741
01:31:10,710 --> 01:31:11,543
How'd you do it?

3742
01:31:11,680 --> 01:31:12,150
Um,

3743
01:31:12,150 --> 01:31:12,983
there was some,

3744
01:31:13,050 --> 01:31:16,800
some neural work by a guy at
Palmer College of Chiropractic,

3745
01:31:16,801 --> 01:31:17,790
which is in Davenport.

3746
01:31:18,330 --> 01:31:19,230
He's uh,

3747
01:31:19,550 --> 01:31:19,680
uh,

3748
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:20,151
during his,

3749
01:31:20,151 --> 01:31:21,150
his named Doctor Dave Journey.

3750
01:31:21,151 --> 01:31:22,860
He's the best athlete to
ever come out of Iowa.

3751
01:31:22,861 --> 01:31:23,221
But he's a,

3752
01:31:23,221 --> 01:31:25,530
he's a genius when it comes
to rebuilding the human body.

3753
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:29,280
He was the strength and conditioning
guy for us Olympic teams,

3754
01:31:29,281 --> 01:31:32,070
some of the sports and then
was also on the bobsled team.

3755
01:31:32,430 --> 01:31:33,100
Guy Was a freak.

3756
01:31:33,100 --> 01:31:34,170
So what kind of stuff did he do?

3757
01:31:34,590 --> 01:31:35,850
He decompressions he,

3758
01:31:35,860 --> 01:31:36,510
he no he,

3759
01:31:36,510 --> 01:31:36,961
well that,

3760
01:31:36,961 --> 01:31:40,710
but he put me in weird positions on a
table on my side and they would block

3761
01:31:40,711 --> 01:31:41,220
certain,

3762
01:31:41,220 --> 01:31:44,850
they would put pressure points to stop
certain nerves from working all this

3763
01:31:44,851 --> 01:31:48,960
other stuff and tell me to move certain
parts of my body and trying to get most

3764
01:31:48,961 --> 01:31:53,070
like Raul for rerouting rerouting of
the nervous system and got things going

3765
01:31:53,071 --> 01:31:55,920
again and rebuilt me and I got to wear,

3766
01:31:55,921 --> 01:32:00,100
this was back to 100% it happened one
other time where this side and this arms

3767
01:32:00,101 --> 01:32:01,540
two inches smaller than this one.

3768
01:32:01,780 --> 01:32:01,991
Yeah,

3769
01:32:01,991 --> 01:32:02,771
I could see it at,

3770
01:32:02,771 --> 01:32:05,440
my shoulder's gone here quite a bit.

3771
01:32:05,470 --> 01:32:06,640
There's some things I just can't do.

3772
01:32:06,641 --> 01:32:08,530
I mean I can still do pull
ups in a bunch of other stuff.

3773
01:32:08,920 --> 01:32:10,000
There's just things I can't do.

3774
01:32:10,180 --> 01:32:12,100
I was wondering if my mind
was playing tricks on me.

3775
01:32:12,101 --> 01:32:12,380
But no,

3776
01:32:12,380 --> 01:32:14,770
it's your right arm looks boss
went through the same thing.

3777
01:32:15,070 --> 01:32:15,610
Right.

3778
01:32:15,610 --> 01:32:17,860
And this is in your
neck right now as well.

3779
01:32:17,880 --> 01:32:18,713
They've uh,

3780
01:32:19,480 --> 01:32:21,580
my vertebraes fused together on their own.

3781
01:32:21,610 --> 01:32:23,180
They wanted to fuse them with wild.

3782
01:32:23,590 --> 01:32:23,771
Yeah.

3783
01:32:23,771 --> 01:32:25,420
Chunks of bones together on their own.

3784
01:32:25,421 --> 01:32:25,631
Yeah.

3785
01:32:25,631 --> 01:32:28,690
So the surgery that they wanted to
do diffuse my vertebraes together,

3786
01:32:29,020 --> 01:32:30,400
my body did it on its own.

3787
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:31,330
Right.

3788
01:32:31,330 --> 01:32:32,740
I've never even heard of such a thing.

3789
01:32:32,950 --> 01:32:33,460
Oh yeah.

3790
01:32:33,460 --> 01:32:33,761
You know,

3791
01:32:33,761 --> 01:32:37,180
long enough when the disc is destroyed
and dissolves and then it just all grows

3792
01:32:37,181 --> 01:32:37,571
together.

3793
01:32:37,571 --> 01:32:39,680
So my vertebra grew
together on their luck.

3794
01:32:40,050 --> 01:32:41,830
That's one of the craziest
things I've ever heard.

3795
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:42,191
Right.

3796
01:32:42,191 --> 01:32:43,840
So I just have to be
careful listening to you.

3797
01:32:43,900 --> 01:32:46,960
I just have to be careful because I've
been paralyzed twice from the neck down.

3798
01:32:47,140 --> 01:32:48,760
I got hit with an
uppercut on the forehead.

3799
01:32:48,761 --> 01:32:51,010
Wasn't even a hard punch
from Jessie Lennox.

3800
01:32:51,011 --> 01:32:55,900
I was sparring with Jesse before my last
fight with Thomas Denny and he hit me

3801
01:32:55,901 --> 01:32:56,450
with an uppercut.

3802
01:32:56,450 --> 01:32:57,041
Wasn't even hard,

3803
01:32:57,041 --> 01:32:59,920
but the whiplash shut
everything down from here down.

3804
01:33:00,070 --> 01:33:02,110
And I went ragdoll and
dropped on my knees,

3805
01:33:02,230 --> 01:33:02,831
Jesus.

3806
01:33:02,831 --> 01:33:03,641
And when I was going down,

3807
01:33:03,641 --> 01:33:03,830
I went,

3808
01:33:03,830 --> 01:33:04,660
oh my neck.

3809
01:33:04,660 --> 01:33:07,060
And I knew that it was really bad.

3810
01:33:07,061 --> 01:33:11,770
And then another time I got cranked from
underneath here and everything's shut

3811
01:33:11,771 --> 01:33:12,400
down again.

3812
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:12,821
But right.

3813
01:33:12,821 --> 01:33:13,930
Both the cuts?

3814
01:33:14,290 --> 01:33:14,591
No,

3815
01:33:14,591 --> 01:33:17,320
this was a somebodies head was under
the heck you're trying to bear hug me.

3816
01:33:17,340 --> 01:33:17,520
Oh,

3817
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:18,190
okay.

3818
01:33:18,190 --> 01:33:18,551
But the,

3819
01:33:18,551 --> 01:33:21,190
the upper cut was right before the Thomas
Danny fight a couple of weeks before.

3820
01:33:21,820 --> 01:33:22,210
And I went,

3821
01:33:22,210 --> 01:33:22,601
well shit,

3822
01:33:22,601 --> 01:33:24,010
I can't get hit at all now.

3823
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:26,890
So I went into that Thomas
Denny fight and just said,

3824
01:33:27,140 --> 01:33:27,460
you know,

3825
01:33:27,460 --> 01:33:28,770
he's not a powerhouse puncher.

3826
01:33:28,771 --> 01:33:29,604
I by any means,

3827
01:33:29,980 --> 01:33:31,150
but I can't get hit at all.

3828
01:33:31,151 --> 01:33:34,030
So it just danced around for the first
five minutes and then knock him out early

3829
01:33:34,031 --> 01:33:35,590
in the second round and you know,

3830
01:33:35,680 --> 01:33:36,910
got out of there without getting hit.

3831
01:33:36,940 --> 01:33:40,270
But it's amazing the sense of urgency
you get when you know you could be

3832
01:33:40,271 --> 01:33:41,104
paralyzed.

3833
01:33:41,640 --> 01:33:42,250
I wish I would.

3834
01:33:42,250 --> 01:33:42,551
I wish,

3835
01:33:42,551 --> 01:33:44,800
I wish I would have fought
like that my whole career.

3836
01:33:45,340 --> 01:33:45,730
Right.

3837
01:33:45,730 --> 01:33:47,110
And then you really never get hit.

3838
01:33:47,230 --> 01:33:48,063
Right.

3839
01:33:48,300 --> 01:33:51,070
So I'm just glad my neck
gave out before my brain did.

3840
01:33:51,490 --> 01:33:53,050
So your neck now,

3841
01:33:53,051 --> 01:33:53,884
how is it?

3842
01:33:54,790 --> 01:33:55,440
Uh,

3843
01:33:55,440 --> 01:33:56,380
I have to be careful.

3844
01:33:56,530 --> 01:33:57,311
I still have to be careful.

3845
01:33:57,311 --> 01:33:59,830
Have you ever thought about getting
one of those artificial discs?

3846
01:34:00,090 --> 01:34:00,520
Um,

3847
01:34:00,520 --> 01:34:00,731
you know,

3848
01:34:00,731 --> 01:34:04,120
that do that at this point they would
have to saw my vertebraes apart and it

3849
01:34:04,121 --> 01:34:06,640
wasn't meant for her to have
them see healing up like that.

3850
01:34:06,641 --> 01:34:07,740
And when they will,

3851
01:34:07,741 --> 01:34:09,280
they sealed together on their own.

3852
01:34:09,320 --> 01:34:10,153
It does happen.

3853
01:34:10,180 --> 01:34:10,790
It does happen.

3854
01:34:10,790 --> 01:34:11,650
Wow.

3855
01:34:11,710 --> 01:34:12,491
That's crazy.

3856
01:34:12,491 --> 01:34:15,040
So when your right arm
come back to a normal size,

3857
01:34:15,190 --> 01:34:16,540
it's been like this for years now.

3858
01:34:16,870 --> 01:34:17,321
Wow.

3859
01:34:17,321 --> 01:34:18,400
I did tons of Rehab.

3860
01:34:18,580 --> 01:34:19,001
This was,

3861
01:34:19,001 --> 01:34:20,200
how long ago did this happen?

3862
01:34:20,920 --> 01:34:21,221
Well,

3863
01:34:21,221 --> 01:34:22,600
when I was training for
the frank Trigg fight,

3864
01:34:22,601 --> 01:34:23,291
when it first happened,

3865
01:34:23,291 --> 01:34:24,520
I didn't even remember again.

3866
01:34:24,530 --> 01:34:25,630
That's what dates,

3867
01:34:25,690 --> 01:34:26,171
dates are.

3868
01:34:26,171 --> 01:34:28,660
Just think about how many
fights you've called.

3869
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:29,833
Right?

3870
01:34:30,340 --> 01:34:35,340
Do you remember certain years of like
any fight I could name or could you pull

3871
01:34:35,951 --> 01:34:36,160
it?

3872
01:34:36,160 --> 01:34:38,200
I see you as kind of a guy
with a photographic memory,

3873
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:40,420
so you're having things
that are interesting.

3874
01:34:40,440 --> 01:34:41,081
It's a pretty sharp,

3875
01:34:41,081 --> 01:34:41,680
but it was kind of like,

3876
01:34:41,680 --> 01:34:42,500
that's my wife.

3877
01:34:42,500 --> 01:34:42,821
She was like,

3878
01:34:42,821 --> 01:34:44,440
this motherfucker doesn't meant shit.

3879
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:47,650
Very selective memory.

3880
01:34:47,651 --> 01:34:48,070
Right.

3881
01:34:48,070 --> 01:34:48,791
But with fights,

3882
01:34:48,791 --> 01:34:50,170
I have a particularly good memory.

3883
01:34:50,200 --> 01:34:53,710
I everything to me because of fighting
for all those years coaching for all

3884
01:34:53,711 --> 01:34:55,540
those years and doing
commentary for all those years.

3885
01:34:56,350 --> 01:34:58,250
One big massive just fights.

3886
01:34:58,251 --> 01:35:00,760
Like I'll remember the
huge trig fights for sure.

3887
01:35:00,900 --> 01:35:01,790
I'll remember,

3888
01:35:01,791 --> 01:35:03,140
you know Tim went on the title,

3889
01:35:03,141 --> 01:35:03,381
you know,

3890
01:35:03,381 --> 01:35:04,130
I remembered that,

3891
01:35:04,130 --> 01:35:05,030
that sort of stuff.

3892
01:35:05,450 --> 01:35:07,430
But everything else is honestly but,

3893
01:35:07,431 --> 01:35:12,200
or like a Jason Black who's in a war
with a guy from American top team and he

3894
01:35:12,201 --> 01:35:13,370
comes back and he sits in the,

3895
01:35:13,460 --> 01:35:14,330
sits on the stool.

3896
01:35:14,331 --> 01:35:16,210
Some of the funniest shit
I've ever seen was in fights.

3897
01:35:16,250 --> 01:35:16,550
Right.

3898
01:35:16,550 --> 01:35:19,190
You've seen it and I think you
might even been calling the fight.

3899
01:35:19,191 --> 01:35:23,360
Jason Black sits down and it's been a
war for two rounds of just insanity.

3900
01:35:23,810 --> 01:35:25,280
And Jason Black was a great wrestler,

3901
01:35:25,281 --> 01:35:26,780
just tough as nails kind of guy.

3902
01:35:27,320 --> 01:35:27,651
And I go,

3903
01:35:27,651 --> 01:35:28,041
Jason,

3904
01:35:28,041 --> 01:35:28,340
Dude,

3905
01:35:28,340 --> 01:35:30,080
stop boxing with this guy.

3906
01:35:30,140 --> 01:35:30,950
Let's go out.

3907
01:35:30,950 --> 01:35:31,400
Let's,

3908
01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:32,360
let's take him down.

3909
01:35:32,361 --> 01:35:33,171
Let's get him on his back.

3910
01:35:33,171 --> 01:35:33,830
Let's keep him there.

3911
01:35:33,830 --> 01:35:36,110
Less rough him up and
let's win this round.

3912
01:35:36,111 --> 01:35:38,330
And we win the fight and we get out
of here and he's doing this while I'm

3913
01:35:38,331 --> 01:35:38,880
talking to him,

3914
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:40,490
he's just looking around at the crowd,

3915
01:35:40,990 --> 01:35:41,531
kind of like this.

3916
01:35:41,531 --> 01:35:41,751
And I go,

3917
01:35:41,751 --> 01:35:42,260
Jason,

3918
01:35:42,260 --> 01:35:43,280
Jason fucking look at me.

3919
01:35:43,730 --> 01:35:44,720
And he looks at me and he goes,

3920
01:35:44,810 --> 01:35:45,091
yeah.

3921
01:35:45,091 --> 01:35:45,381
And I go,

3922
01:35:45,381 --> 01:35:46,400
what I just tell you to do?

3923
01:35:46,401 --> 01:35:47,234
And he goes,

3924
01:35:47,460 --> 01:35:48,293
go out and dance with him.

3925
01:35:48,620 --> 01:35:51,170
And the Fertitta brothers
are right there and Dana.

3926
01:35:51,171 --> 01:35:53,360
And they start laughing
their asses off and I go,

3927
01:35:53,361 --> 01:35:53,661
whatever,

3928
01:35:53,661 --> 01:35:54,650
go out and do what you want to do.

3929
01:35:54,680 --> 01:35:55,430
So he went out,

3930
01:35:55,430 --> 01:35:56,450
it turned into a brawl.

3931
01:35:56,450 --> 01:35:57,290
He ended up losing the,

3932
01:35:58,670 --> 01:36:00,110
Jason is one of the guys,

3933
01:36:00,140 --> 01:36:04,010
the first guys that I saw cut weight
to the point where I was like,

3934
01:36:04,040 --> 01:36:04,730
okay,

3935
01:36:04,730 --> 01:36:09,730
he might die when he went to 55
he was a fucking anatomy lesson.

3936
01:36:11,340 --> 01:36:12,140
You remember?

3937
01:36:12,140 --> 01:36:12,590
Yeah,

3938
01:36:12,590 --> 01:36:16,400
he sure you remember when that
mother fucker had zero fat.

3939
01:36:16,730 --> 01:36:17,750
It was crazy.

3940
01:36:17,751 --> 01:36:19,730
And he was really a strong guy.

3941
01:36:19,731 --> 01:36:20,540
I mean he was,

3942
01:36:20,540 --> 01:36:21,730
I mean if he got help position,

3943
01:36:21,731 --> 01:36:22,830
she ate it under.

3944
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:23,600
Appreciate it.

3945
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:25,130
One of the toughest guys
I've ever been around.

3946
01:36:25,131 --> 01:36:29,780
I feel like he was a tweener like maybe
a little too big for 52 for seven or 50

3947
01:36:30,140 --> 01:36:31,400
or 70 small for seven.

3948
01:36:31,401 --> 01:36:32,150
Yeah,

3949
01:36:32,150 --> 01:36:34,970
it was a rough day or a few
guys like that that would like,

3950
01:36:34,971 --> 01:36:35,241
you know,

3951
01:36:35,241 --> 01:36:36,590
real world class fighters.

3952
01:36:36,591 --> 01:36:40,040
But the reality of those seventies is
you're dealing with guys that are cutting

3953
01:36:40,041 --> 01:36:41,390
from two oh five and up.

3954
01:36:41,810 --> 01:36:44,030
And the reality that
50 fives is that like,

3955
01:36:44,060 --> 01:36:46,550
that's not fucking horrible
strain for your body.

3956
01:36:47,290 --> 01:36:48,123
I remember,

3957
01:36:48,700 --> 01:36:49,280
you know,

3958
01:36:49,280 --> 01:36:52,070
seeing guys cut weight and being
a lot of trouble physically.

3959
01:36:52,071 --> 01:36:52,430
Right.

3960
01:36:52,430 --> 01:36:54,620
But our thing was always
make weight no matter what.

3961
01:36:55,010 --> 01:36:55,311
I mean,

3962
01:36:55,311 --> 01:36:56,240
that's just the way it was.

3963
01:36:56,750 --> 01:37:00,290
I think I had one guy that didn't make
weight for a fight in the IFL and he got

3964
01:37:00,291 --> 01:37:01,790
run out of the gym because of it.

3965
01:37:01,880 --> 01:37:02,170
Right,

3966
01:37:02,170 --> 01:37:02,720
right.

3967
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:05,480
He just got run out of the gym because
everybody was so pissed at him for not

3968
01:37:05,481 --> 01:37:05,990
making weight.

3969
01:37:05,990 --> 01:37:06,823
Right.

3970
01:37:07,100 --> 01:37:07,610
Um,

3971
01:37:07,610 --> 01:37:09,050
seen some horrible
weight cuts with people,

3972
01:37:09,051 --> 01:37:11,810
but I had to wait cut
where it was in New Jersey.

3973
01:37:12,500 --> 01:37:14,000
The weigh ins were the day of the fight.

3974
01:37:14,150 --> 01:37:17,570
Which fight was the Shonie
Carter at continental airlines
or remains for the day

3975
01:37:17,571 --> 01:37:18,740
of the fight that morning.

3976
01:37:18,741 --> 01:37:18,980
Right.

3977
01:37:18,980 --> 01:37:19,490
Why?

3978
01:37:19,490 --> 01:37:21,260
Just the way it was and
the way it broke down,

3979
01:37:21,261 --> 01:37:24,350
the way it all went down
was I had a new gym,

3980
01:37:25,030 --> 01:37:25,863
a Gold's gym,

3981
01:37:26,840 --> 01:37:27,950
building a brand new house,

3982
01:37:28,220 --> 01:37:29,120
had a brand new baby,

3983
01:37:29,540 --> 01:37:32,420
and I had to win the fight to have
enough money for the down payment on the

3984
01:37:32,421 --> 01:37:32,870
house.

3985
01:37:32,870 --> 01:37:33,081
Oh,

3986
01:37:33,081 --> 01:37:33,681
Jesus.

3987
01:37:33,681 --> 01:37:34,514
They're already building it.

3988
01:37:34,520 --> 01:37:36,320
We already signed the
paperwork and Christ.

3989
01:37:36,620 --> 01:37:39,860
So I'm cutting weight and I've been
so busy that that wasn't paying enough

3990
01:37:39,861 --> 01:37:41,330
attention to my weight
and I was struggling.

3991
01:37:41,331 --> 01:37:45,440
So the whole night I stayed awake the
whole night and all I thought about was,

3992
01:37:45,441 --> 01:37:46,400
I know I can beat this guy.

3993
01:37:46,401 --> 01:37:47,660
This guy is not going to beat me.

3994
01:37:47,690 --> 01:37:49,800
But if he head butts me
or for whatever reason,

3995
01:37:49,801 --> 01:37:52,250
and I don't win the fight
and lose that money,

3996
01:37:52,251 --> 01:37:52,941
I lose my house.

3997
01:37:52,941 --> 01:37:53,391
Oh my God.

3998
01:37:53,391 --> 01:37:54,051
I start to panic.

3999
01:37:54,051 --> 01:37:54,590
Right.

4000
01:37:54,590 --> 01:37:55,770
And when you're cutting weight like that,

4001
01:37:55,800 --> 01:37:56,250
it's,

4002
01:37:56,250 --> 01:37:58,140
everything's magnified a hundred times.

4003
01:37:58,160 --> 01:37:58,590
The,

4004
01:37:58,590 --> 01:37:58,930
the,

4005
01:37:58,930 --> 01:38:00,450
just the fear and everything else.

4006
01:38:01,260 --> 01:38:06,260
And all I thought about was that water
and egg white or a scrambled eggs all

4007
01:38:06,391 --> 01:38:07,200
night,

4008
01:38:07,200 --> 01:38:08,033
the whole night.

4009
01:38:08,550 --> 01:38:09,930
And by the time it was time to weigh in,

4010
01:38:09,931 --> 01:38:12,930
I went and knocked on Matt Hughes
and Jens Pulver his door and I go,

4011
01:38:12,931 --> 01:38:13,350
hey man,

4012
01:38:13,350 --> 01:38:15,120
I'm in some serious trouble right now.

4013
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:16,260
I'm I,

4014
01:38:16,260 --> 01:38:19,260
because I sucked on ice cubes all
night and I gained like two pounds or

4015
01:38:19,261 --> 01:38:19,531
whatever.

4016
01:38:19,531 --> 01:38:20,610
So I had to go cut again.

4017
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:21,210
What?

4018
01:38:21,210 --> 01:38:24,300
I just don't wait just from
sucking on ice cubes all night.

4019
01:38:24,301 --> 01:38:25,320
Two pounds of ice cubes,

4020
01:38:25,350 --> 01:38:25,980
I guess.

4021
01:38:25,980 --> 01:38:26,221
Yeah,

4022
01:38:26,221 --> 01:38:27,570
because I didn't even know where I was at.

4023
01:38:27,571 --> 01:38:28,380
I was losing my mind.

4024
01:38:28,380 --> 01:38:28,561
Right.

4025
01:38:28,561 --> 01:38:29,250
Wow.

4026
01:38:29,250 --> 01:38:30,390
So I did that all night.

4027
01:38:30,420 --> 01:38:31,253
And then,

4028
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:35,190
so I made weight and then I went back
to my hotel room and I started cramping.

4029
01:38:35,550 --> 01:38:36,361
Everything cramped.

4030
01:38:36,361 --> 01:38:36,841
I at the time,

4031
01:38:36,841 --> 01:38:40,170
my wrestling shoes on as tight as I could
possibly tie them so my feet wouldn't

4032
01:38:40,171 --> 01:38:41,004
bend like this.

4033
01:38:41,060 --> 01:38:41,220
Right.

4034
01:38:41,220 --> 01:38:41,880
Whoa.

4035
01:38:41,880 --> 01:38:43,560
And then my cat started cramping.

4036
01:38:43,650 --> 01:38:47,250
Everything cramped to the point where I
was curled up in the fetal position and

4037
01:38:47,251 --> 01:38:48,660
I knew I had to fight that night.

4038
01:38:48,810 --> 01:38:50,050
Holy Shit.

4039
01:38:50,100 --> 01:38:50,881
So I couldn't see.

4040
01:38:50,881 --> 01:38:51,300
Right.

4041
01:38:51,300 --> 01:38:53,130
There was a bunch of stuff
going wrong with my body.

4042
01:38:53,940 --> 01:38:56,940
So I called up Monte Cox
in his room and I go,

4043
01:38:56,941 --> 01:38:59,370
you got to get somebody to take
me to the hospital to get ivs.

4044
01:38:59,371 --> 01:39:00,420
Are the shifts not happening?

4045
01:39:00,840 --> 01:39:01,081
He goes,

4046
01:39:01,081 --> 01:39:01,380
all right,

4047
01:39:01,380 --> 01:39:02,370
I'm sending Tom Sour.

4048
01:39:02,490 --> 01:39:02,880
Right.

4049
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:03,820
So you remember Tom's house?

4050
01:39:03,821 --> 01:39:04,470
Yes.

4051
01:39:04,470 --> 01:39:07,170
So Tom's hour comes to get
me and everybody who knows,

4052
01:39:07,171 --> 01:39:09,450
Tom knows he had really severe Tourette's,

4053
01:39:10,080 --> 01:39:10,410
right.

4054
01:39:10,410 --> 01:39:11,460
Really severe Tourette's.

4055
01:39:11,461 --> 01:39:12,600
Like if he's around black people,

4056
01:39:12,601 --> 01:39:14,370
the n words getting yelled constantly,

4057
01:39:15,030 --> 01:39:15,800
right?

4058
01:39:15,800 --> 01:39:16,210
Uh,

4059
01:39:16,210 --> 01:39:16,500
yeah,

4060
01:39:16,500 --> 01:39:17,580
he's around women,

4061
01:39:17,581 --> 01:39:19,920
these yellow and hunt whore bitch,

4062
01:39:19,921 --> 01:39:20,251
bitch,

4063
01:39:20,251 --> 01:39:20,521
bitch.

4064
01:39:20,521 --> 01:39:22,580
But it's worth right the whole time.

4065
01:39:22,860 --> 01:39:23,693
Really loud.

4066
01:39:23,880 --> 01:39:24,331
So anyway,

4067
01:39:24,331 --> 01:39:25,031
he comes and gets me.

4068
01:39:25,031 --> 01:39:25,940
He takes me to the hospital.

4069
01:39:25,960 --> 01:39:27,660
We're walking up to the
hospital in New Jersey.

4070
01:39:27,661 --> 01:39:29,760
The whole hospital is all glass windows.

4071
01:39:30,240 --> 01:39:32,460
Everybody that works in
the hospital is black.

4072
01:39:33,090 --> 01:39:34,480
Oh No.

4073
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:36,750
Imagine the kind of situation
I'm in mentally and physically.

4074
01:39:36,751 --> 01:39:38,730
And I stopped and I put my
hand on his chest and I go,

4075
01:39:38,731 --> 01:39:38,971
Tom,

4076
01:39:38,971 --> 01:39:40,380
you can not go in here with me.

4077
01:39:41,250 --> 01:39:41,970
Oh my God,

4078
01:39:41,970 --> 01:39:43,830
you're going to yell the
n word a million times.

4079
01:39:43,831 --> 01:39:44,611
They're going to kick us out.

4080
01:39:44,611 --> 01:39:46,560
I'm not going to get my ivs right.

4081
01:39:46,620 --> 01:39:47,630
I'm not going to be able to fight it.

4082
01:39:47,631 --> 01:39:48,421
I'm gonna lose my house.

4083
01:39:48,421 --> 01:39:49,254
I was like,

4084
01:39:49,340 --> 01:39:50,370
I was losing my mind.

4085
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:50,730
Right.

4086
01:39:50,730 --> 01:39:51,450
And he goes,

4087
01:39:51,450 --> 01:39:52,510
pat could kick it.

4088
01:39:52,760 --> 01:39:53,593
It's okay.

4089
01:39:54,690 --> 01:39:54,901
Chirp.

4090
01:39:54,901 --> 01:39:55,141
Chirp.

4091
01:39:55,141 --> 01:39:55,351
Chirp,

4092
01:39:55,351 --> 01:39:55,561
click,

4093
01:39:55,561 --> 01:39:56,160
click.

4094
01:39:56,160 --> 01:39:56,610
Right,

4095
01:39:56,610 --> 01:39:56,760
right.

4096
01:39:56,760 --> 01:39:57,001
He goes,

4097
01:39:57,001 --> 01:39:57,421
it's fine.

4098
01:39:57,421 --> 01:39:57,631
He goes,

4099
01:39:57,631 --> 01:39:59,430
I'm a Dade county paramedic.

4100
01:39:59,431 --> 01:39:59,701
He goes,

4101
01:39:59,701 --> 01:40:00,930
I deal with this constantly.

4102
01:40:00,931 --> 01:40:01,764
It's okay.

4103
01:40:01,980 --> 01:40:02,671
So we walk in,

4104
01:40:02,671 --> 01:40:04,440
we go up to the nurse
at the reception desk,

4105
01:40:04,441 --> 01:40:04,771
and he goes,

4106
01:40:04,771 --> 01:40:04,891
hey.

4107
01:40:04,891 --> 01:40:05,131
He goes,

4108
01:40:05,131 --> 01:40:05,964

4109
01:40:06,150 --> 01:40:06,511

01:40:06,511 --> 01:40:06,721

01:40:06,721 --> 01:40:07,860
Click Edward Edward,

4112
01:40:07,861 --> 01:40:08,694

and she,

4114
01:40:10,170 --> 01:40:11,880
she looks at him and goes,

4115
01:40:11,970 --> 01:40:13,020
say what?

4116
01:40:13,770 --> 01:40:14,400
And he goes,

4117
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:15,270
I have Tourette's.

4118
01:40:15,271 --> 01:40:16,200
I have severe Tourette's.

4119
01:40:16,201 --> 01:40:17,034
Please don't.

4120
01:40:17,370 --> 01:40:17,701
He goes,

4121
01:40:17,701 --> 01:40:19,590
my friend needs an ivy badly.

4122
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:20,850
And she looks at me and goes,

4123
01:40:20,940 --> 01:40:22,050
oh shit.

4124
01:40:22,100 --> 01:40:23,400
Like I looked that bad.

4125
01:40:23,790 --> 01:40:25,560
My eyes were way back in my head.

4126
01:40:25,590 --> 01:40:26,700
I was in rough shape.

4127
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:28,830
So they gave me three liters of saline,

4128
01:40:28,980 --> 01:40:29,940
three liters.

4129
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:30,540
Yeah,

4130
01:40:30,540 --> 01:40:31,340
revived me.

4131
01:40:31,340 --> 01:40:32,910
And like a two liter Pepsi,

4132
01:40:33,510 --> 01:40:34,410
that was three of us.

4133
01:40:34,830 --> 01:40:36,400
Three of those three,

4134
01:40:36,560 --> 01:40:36,930
three,

4135
01:40:36,930 --> 01:40:37,171
three,

4136
01:40:37,171 --> 01:40:37,821
one liters.

4137
01:40:37,821 --> 01:40:38,160
Yeah.

4138
01:40:38,160 --> 01:40:39,480
That's a lot of water.

4139
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:39,810
Right,

4140
01:40:39,810 --> 01:40:40,370
right.

4141
01:40:40,370 --> 01:40:41,790
And so they revived me enough.

4142
01:40:41,791 --> 01:40:43,860
I was still seeing double
when it came fight time.

4143
01:40:44,490 --> 01:40:46,980
And so the first round
I just took Shoney down.

4144
01:40:46,981 --> 01:40:47,431
I threw him,

4145
01:40:47,431 --> 01:40:47,911
took him down,

4146
01:40:47,911 --> 01:40:52,200
stayed mounted on him the whole first
round to get him to wear himself out with

4147
01:40:52,201 --> 01:40:52,621
punches,

4148
01:40:52,621 --> 01:40:53,110
elbows,

4149
01:40:53,110 --> 01:40:53,651
just stuff.

4150
01:40:53,651 --> 01:40:55,450
Just not going overboard.

4151
01:40:55,550 --> 01:40:57,830
But I wanted him to be tired
going into the second round.

4152
01:40:57,831 --> 01:40:59,680
How diminish to you in this state?

4153
01:40:59,770 --> 01:41:00,603
Bad.

4154
01:41:00,820 --> 01:41:01,061
Yeah.

4155
01:41:01,061 --> 01:41:01,521
It was bad.

4156
01:41:01,521 --> 01:41:02,620
Like half,

4157
01:41:02,620 --> 01:41:03,580
half year capacity maybe.

4158
01:41:03,581 --> 01:41:04,330
Yeah.

4159
01:41:04,330 --> 01:41:05,470
So the second round I just went,

4160
01:41:05,471 --> 01:41:05,681
okay,

4161
01:41:05,681 --> 01:41:06,430
now I got to end it.

4162
01:41:06,430 --> 01:41:07,000
So I just,

4163
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:08,440
I had kicked him and knock him out.

4164
01:41:08,470 --> 01:41:09,850
I remember that and I just went,

4165
01:41:10,330 --> 01:41:12,520
I made it out of that
with the skin of my teeth.

4166
01:41:12,690 --> 01:41:13,210
Ooh.

4167
01:41:13,210 --> 01:41:13,630
You know?

4168
01:41:13,630 --> 01:41:16,720
But so it's just weight
cutting can be very extreme.

4169
01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:17,351
Yeah.

4170
01:41:17,351 --> 01:41:17,951
It really can.

4171
01:41:17,951 --> 01:41:19,930
But we always believed in
that you have to make weight,

4172
01:41:19,960 --> 01:41:20,771
then you sign your name.

4173
01:41:20,771 --> 01:41:24,170
And that's why I get so pissed off and
disgusted when people don't make what.

4174
01:41:24,290 --> 01:41:24,930
Yeah.

4175
01:41:24,930 --> 01:41:25,330
Well,

4176
01:41:25,330 --> 01:41:27,310
it's a lack of discipline for sure.

4177
01:41:27,340 --> 01:41:27,730
If,

4178
01:41:27,730 --> 01:41:30,370
unless it's not physically possible
for you to make the weight.

4179
01:41:30,430 --> 01:41:32,230
Like if you're a heavyweight and
you want to make lightweight,

4180
01:41:32,231 --> 01:41:33,370
that's not physically possible.

4181
01:41:33,400 --> 01:41:33,641
Right.

4182
01:41:33,641 --> 01:41:34,510
So then don't sign it.

4183
01:41:34,511 --> 01:41:35,560
It's a lack of commitment.

4184
01:41:35,561 --> 01:41:35,711
See,

4185
01:41:35,711 --> 01:41:36,640
that's the thing that I,

4186
01:41:36,790 --> 01:41:37,990
I'm disgusted most with,

4187
01:41:37,991 --> 01:41:38,710
is that people don't,

4188
01:41:38,710 --> 01:41:39,820
aren't committed to what they do.

4189
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:41,080
Right.

4190
01:41:41,080 --> 01:41:42,640
You've obviously committed to what you do.

4191
01:41:42,640 --> 01:41:44,110
You're very good at
the things that you do,

4192
01:41:44,290 --> 01:41:44,680
right?

4193
01:41:44,680 --> 01:41:45,041
It is,

4194
01:41:45,041 --> 01:41:45,551
it's obvious.

4195
01:41:45,551 --> 01:41:46,660
You're obviously a talented guy,

4196
01:41:46,661 --> 01:41:47,860
but you work at your craft.

4197
01:41:47,980 --> 01:41:48,813
Right?

4198
01:41:49,300 --> 01:41:49,910
You know,

4199
01:41:49,910 --> 01:41:50,150
there,

4200
01:41:50,150 --> 01:41:51,850
there came a time where
I had to leave college,

4201
01:41:51,851 --> 01:41:56,080
just go home and take care of my alien
mother and had to work three jobs and

4202
01:41:56,081 --> 01:42:00,280
realized sitting in a basement that
that was raised in every time it rained,

4203
01:42:00,281 --> 01:42:00,850
it flooded.

4204
01:42:00,850 --> 01:42:01,900
My feet were in water.

4205
01:42:01,901 --> 01:42:03,460
I woke up one morning and that was doing,

4206
01:42:03,540 --> 01:42:03,880
you know,

4207
01:42:03,880 --> 01:42:06,250
I had started out fighting
and everything and I said,

4208
01:42:06,251 --> 01:42:06,820
this is it.

4209
01:42:06,820 --> 01:42:07,720
I'm going to win a world title.

4210
01:42:07,721 --> 01:42:08,800
I mean the winning the UFC title,

4211
01:42:09,010 --> 01:42:09,790
what's it?

4212
01:42:09,790 --> 01:42:10,623
This is it.

4213
01:42:10,990 --> 01:42:15,700
And I loaded a nine millimeter pistol and
I put a round in the chamber and I put

4214
01:42:15,701 --> 01:42:16,720
it in my sock drawer and I said,

4215
01:42:16,721 --> 01:42:19,180
if I don't want a world title that
Gun's going in my mouth and I'm done,

4216
01:42:20,050 --> 01:42:20,830
this is it.

4217
01:42:20,830 --> 01:42:21,280
Right?

4218
01:42:21,280 --> 01:42:22,750
So every time I fought,

4219
01:42:23,290 --> 01:42:26,350
I thought about that gun in my sock
drawer and not wanting to go home to it.

4220
01:42:26,440 --> 01:42:27,011
And that's just,

4221
01:42:27,011 --> 01:42:27,760
that's commitment.

4222
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:28,593
That was my,

4223
01:42:28,690 --> 01:42:31,360
that's what was needed for me to
succeed at that point in my life.

4224
01:42:31,510 --> 01:42:32,350
That's the way it was.

4225
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:35,980
So when I see people not when they're
talented and they're not committed,

4226
01:42:36,010 --> 01:42:37,150
I don't want anything to do with them.

4227
01:42:37,300 --> 01:42:38,133
I just don't,

4228
01:42:38,170 --> 01:42:39,430
I don't have time for people like that.

4229
01:42:39,460 --> 01:42:42,940
I'll take a guy who's committed
and sucks and training every day.

4230
01:42:43,320 --> 01:42:43,540
Right.

4231
01:42:43,540 --> 01:42:44,590
Because I love his commitment.

4232
01:42:45,040 --> 01:42:45,221
Well,

4233
01:42:45,221 --> 01:42:48,640
there's some guys that just
make some real critical errors,

4234
01:42:48,641 --> 01:42:49,840
but they're incredibly talented.

4235
01:42:49,841 --> 01:42:50,890
Like Norma Gum head off.

4236
01:42:51,070 --> 01:42:51,311
Like,

4237
01:42:51,311 --> 01:42:51,551
you know,

4238
01:42:51,551 --> 01:42:53,680
when he missed fight the
fight with Tony Ferguson,

4239
01:42:54,280 --> 01:42:54,941
he literally,

4240
01:42:54,941 --> 01:42:56,260
his body was shutting down.

4241
01:42:56,261 --> 01:42:57,610
They'd had to take him to the hospital.

4242
01:42:57,640 --> 01:42:58,720
I'll comes to preparation though.

4243
01:42:58,720 --> 01:42:59,740
She didn't red haired better.

4244
01:42:59,770 --> 01:43:00,041
Yeah.

4245
01:43:00,041 --> 01:43:02,380
He should have gotten lighter beforehand.

4246
01:43:02,381 --> 01:43:03,340
Should've watched the Diet.

4247
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:05,170
Now that he has a nutritionist,

4248
01:43:05,171 --> 01:43:07,930
he made weighed pretty easy for his last
fight with Barboza and now he's going

4249
01:43:07,931 --> 01:43:09,700
to be fighting for the title
and the guy's a monster.

4250
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:10,900
He's a fucking monster.

4251
01:43:10,901 --> 01:43:11,290
Yeah.

4252
01:43:11,290 --> 01:43:11,951
But you know,

4253
01:43:11,951 --> 01:43:13,510
aspirin had a real good point.

4254
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:13,810
Uh,

4255
01:43:13,810 --> 01:43:16,420
what they do with one fc I
think is the way to do it.

4256
01:43:16,780 --> 01:43:17,051
You know,

4257
01:43:17,051 --> 01:43:17,861
with one FC,

4258
01:43:17,861 --> 01:43:18,641
they test you,

4259
01:43:18,641 --> 01:43:22,720
they have a hydration test and they test
you and whatever weight the champions

4260
01:43:22,721 --> 01:43:23,200
are,

4261
01:43:23,200 --> 01:43:26,650
they just bumped everybody up a notch
and they bumped him up to one 85.

4262
01:43:26,830 --> 01:43:27,160
Yeah.

4263
01:43:27,160 --> 01:43:27,430
He'll like,

4264
01:43:27,430 --> 01:43:28,570
there's no cutting weight here.

4265
01:43:29,240 --> 01:43:32,770
And I think that's just an unfortunate
part of martial arts is this weight

4266
01:43:32,771 --> 01:43:33,604
cutting shit,

4267
01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:34,450
wrestling,

4268
01:43:34,450 --> 01:43:34,900
boxing,

4269
01:43:34,900 --> 01:43:35,340
this,

4270
01:43:35,340 --> 01:43:35,890
think about,

4271
01:43:35,890 --> 01:43:36,460
you know,

4272
01:43:36,460 --> 01:43:37,320
they complained about the,

4273
01:43:37,540 --> 01:43:39,280
the fighters cutting weight.

4274
01:43:39,340 --> 01:43:40,173
That's for,

4275
01:43:40,600 --> 01:43:40,811
you know,

4276
01:43:40,811 --> 01:43:41,111
three,

4277
01:43:41,111 --> 01:43:42,190
four times a year.

4278
01:43:42,250 --> 01:43:44,170
Really not that hard.

4279
01:43:44,200 --> 01:43:44,500
Right.

4280
01:43:44,500 --> 01:43:47,740
Try cutting weight your entire
life every wrestling season.

4281
01:43:47,770 --> 01:43:49,330
And when you Russell during the winter,

4282
01:43:49,570 --> 01:43:50,201
then spring,

4283
01:43:50,201 --> 01:43:51,650
summer for freestyle and Greco.

4284
01:43:51,740 --> 01:43:52,490
Right.

4285
01:43:52,490 --> 01:43:56,090
That was probably the thing that made
me so small compared to my brothers.

4286
01:43:56,091 --> 01:43:56,601
They were all six,

4287
01:43:56,601 --> 01:43:56,781
four,

4288
01:43:56,781 --> 01:43:56,991
six,

4289
01:43:56,991 --> 01:43:58,040
five sure is.

4290
01:43:58,041 --> 01:44:01,310
I cut weight from sixth grade all the
way through high school and into college

4291
01:44:01,311 --> 01:44:02,144
and then fighting.

4292
01:44:02,150 --> 01:44:02,421
Right.

4293
01:44:02,421 --> 01:44:02,810
So my,

4294
01:44:02,810 --> 01:44:04,280
during my growing years though,

4295
01:44:04,610 --> 01:44:05,443
I was starving.

4296
01:44:05,480 --> 01:44:05,810
Right.

4297
01:44:05,810 --> 01:44:06,860
That's just the way it was.

4298
01:44:07,160 --> 01:44:08,840
And so it stunted my growth most likely.

4299
01:44:08,930 --> 01:44:09,770
I'm sure it did.

4300
01:44:09,800 --> 01:44:10,101
Yeah,

4301
01:44:10,101 --> 01:44:10,370
there was,

4302
01:44:10,370 --> 01:44:12,290
I knew a lot of guys from
wrestling that were like that.

4303
01:44:12,320 --> 01:44:13,910
The brothers were big and they were small,

4304
01:44:14,120 --> 01:44:16,730
but I think that it's
just unnecessary for MMA.

4305
01:44:16,760 --> 01:44:16,941
I mean,

4306
01:44:16,941 --> 01:44:19,880
you're dealing with professional athletes
at the highest level of the game.

4307
01:44:20,120 --> 01:44:21,710
I think they should just cut it out.

4308
01:44:21,740 --> 01:44:23,940
I just think they should
implement going to happen though.

4309
01:44:24,420 --> 01:44:25,870
Everybody's going to look at the drive.

4310
01:44:25,890 --> 01:44:27,770
See if they do the one FC rules.

4311
01:44:27,890 --> 01:44:29,270
They test you three times.

4312
01:44:29,540 --> 01:44:30,351
They test your weight,

4313
01:44:30,351 --> 01:44:31,490
they get a base weight off of you.

4314
01:44:31,491 --> 01:44:32,510
They get hydration levels.

4315
01:44:32,540 --> 01:44:35,450
Everybody has to follow that same look.

4316
01:44:35,451 --> 01:44:37,190
Everybody has to follow the Usada rules.

4317
01:44:37,490 --> 01:44:38,060
I don't think,

4318
01:44:38,060 --> 01:44:38,781
I think the,

4319
01:44:38,781 --> 01:44:39,200
the,

4320
01:44:39,200 --> 01:44:40,640
the rules like in,

4321
01:44:40,670 --> 01:44:44,120
in reference to guys using
performance enhancing drugs,

4322
01:44:44,450 --> 01:44:48,080
it's just as critical to keep guys
from fighting dehydrated or from being

4323
01:44:48,081 --> 01:44:48,914
dehydrated.

4324
01:44:48,990 --> 01:44:49,823
Now it's,

4325
01:44:49,850 --> 01:44:51,260
I mean obviously there's risks.

4326
01:44:51,410 --> 01:44:52,130
Yeah.

4327
01:44:52,130 --> 01:44:53,060
Fighting dehydrated.

4328
01:44:53,061 --> 01:44:53,894
You saw the,

4329
01:44:53,960 --> 01:44:54,740
which boxing,

4330
01:44:54,740 --> 01:44:55,760
which boxing match was,

4331
01:44:55,761 --> 01:44:55,910
it?

4332
01:44:55,910 --> 01:44:56,743
Was it

4333
01:44:57,970 --> 01:45:00,380
got a little Italian dude
got the hell beat out of him.

4334
01:45:00,381 --> 01:45:00,801
Was it,

4335
01:45:00,801 --> 01:45:01,634
um,

4336
01:45:02,420 --> 01:45:05,420
who fought ward three times and wars?

4337
01:45:05,750 --> 01:45:07,280
Micky Ward and Touro.

4338
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:08,353
God,

4339
01:45:08,390 --> 01:45:10,010
daddy fought a little Muchow.

4340
01:45:10,680 --> 01:45:11,540
What it not come out.

4341
01:45:11,650 --> 01:45:14,480
Mosey Macho fuckers is
named Kitty from Maine.

4342
01:45:14,481 --> 01:45:15,230
Louis domain,

4343
01:45:15,230 --> 01:45:18,810
but erected it destroyed him cause
he was so much bigger than that.

4344
01:45:18,890 --> 01:45:19,331
So that,

4345
01:45:19,331 --> 01:45:19,551
you know,

4346
01:45:19,551 --> 01:45:20,690
there's risks obviously.

4347
01:45:20,840 --> 01:45:21,890
So who was that

4348
01:45:23,320 --> 01:45:26,300
put pull up our Touro
Godaddy's professional record.

4349
01:45:26,330 --> 01:45:27,080
Yeah,

4350
01:45:27,080 --> 01:45:28,100
he would think I remember that.

4351
01:45:28,130 --> 01:45:28,630
His,

4352
01:45:28,630 --> 01:45:30,710
his name was Joe who was from Lewiston.

4353
01:45:30,711 --> 01:45:34,790
Maine is a talented guy and Arturo
Gotti was looked like he was two weight

4354
01:45:34,791 --> 01:45:36,650
classes bigger than him
and he fucked him up.

4355
01:45:36,890 --> 01:45:37,940
But yeah.

4356
01:45:39,390 --> 01:45:40,130
Okay.

4357
01:45:40,130 --> 01:45:40,963
If you've got a peek ahead,

4358
01:45:41,660 --> 01:45:42,530
is he writing it down?

4359
01:45:42,870 --> 01:45:43,520
What would he got here?

4360
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:44,030
Um,

4361
01:45:44,030 --> 01:45:46,250
you just had to go way back now we alive.

4362
01:45:46,550 --> 01:45:47,480
Joe Camacho.

4363
01:45:47,690 --> 01:45:48,370
I needed a bucket.

4364
01:45:48,370 --> 01:45:49,220
Joey Camacho.

4365
01:45:49,250 --> 01:45:50,090
That's who it was.

4366
01:45:50,360 --> 01:45:51,193
Joey Camacho.

4367
01:45:51,950 --> 01:45:52,521
I remembered that.

4368
01:45:52,521 --> 01:45:53,300
That was horrific.

4369
01:45:53,300 --> 01:45:54,890
That was 2000 man.

4370
01:45:54,891 --> 01:45:55,790
Time flies.

4371
01:45:56,180 --> 01:45:57,013
How crazy.

4372
01:45:57,830 --> 01:45:58,051
Cut.

4373
01:45:58,051 --> 01:45:58,884
Melted.

4374
01:45:59,240 --> 01:45:59,990
Tough guy.

4375
01:45:59,990 --> 01:46:00,920
Can't hold his piss.

4376
01:46:01,130 --> 01:46:01,963
Now we know.

4377
01:46:02,480 --> 01:46:03,950
That's probably why I had
a hard time cutting weight.

4378
01:46:04,150 --> 01:46:05,030
It doesn't make any sense.

4379
01:46:05,570 --> 01:46:06,403
Um,

4380
01:46:06,770 --> 01:46:07,540
pull that fight up.

4381
01:46:07,540 --> 01:46:10,550
I'm gonna see that fight
and make you a Arturo Gotti.

4382
01:46:10,580 --> 01:46:11,510
Joey Camacho.

4383
01:46:12,050 --> 01:46:13,280
That was a disturbing one.

4384
01:46:13,820 --> 01:46:17,480
The thing is like you see so many
of those kind of Kaos in MMA.

4385
01:46:17,870 --> 01:46:18,950
It makes you realize,

4386
01:46:19,070 --> 01:46:19,850
yeah,

4387
01:46:19,850 --> 01:46:20,511
our two of God,

4388
01:46:20,511 --> 01:46:25,220
he was just far bigger than him
in this fight and he was also,

4389
01:46:25,640 --> 01:46:30,230
this is Arturo Gotti when he was really
world class two at the top of his game.

4390
01:46:30,750 --> 01:46:32,510
What they're working on
a movie or something.

4391
01:46:32,930 --> 01:46:33,290
Well,

4392
01:46:33,290 --> 01:46:33,531
you know,

4393
01:46:33,531 --> 01:46:36,560
he was killed by his girlfriend
and just killed by his girlfriend.

4394
01:46:36,561 --> 01:46:37,910
She got away with it or his wife,

4395
01:46:37,940 --> 01:46:42,050
his wife was this Brazilian chick and
she got out of jail when she got out of

4396
01:46:42,051 --> 01:46:42,291
jail.

4397
01:46:42,291 --> 01:46:43,130
She was smiling.

4398
01:46:43,160 --> 01:46:44,240
It's really disturbing.

4399
01:46:44,570 --> 01:46:46,010
He got clipped there with a left hook.

4400
01:46:46,730 --> 01:46:47,840
It was real bad.

4401
01:46:47,841 --> 01:46:48,141
Like,

4402
01:46:48,141 --> 01:46:48,974
um,

4403
01:46:49,410 --> 01:46:50,010
they think that

4404
01:46:50,010 --> 01:46:50,843
there was some severe,

4405
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:51,061
oh,

4406
01:46:51,061 --> 01:46:51,900
there's the KL.

4407
01:46:52,230 --> 01:46:54,490
They think there's some severe uh,

4408
01:46:54,510 --> 01:46:56,730
corruption involved in her,

4409
01:46:56,790 --> 01:46:57,210
uh,

4410
01:46:57,210 --> 01:46:57,990
her acquittal,

4411
01:46:57,990 --> 01:47:01,830
cause she got acquitted in
Brazil and they said that he was,

4412
01:47:01,860 --> 01:47:03,390
he committed suicide,

4413
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:07,020
but he had some sort of blunt
force trauma on his head.

4414
01:47:07,380 --> 01:47:07,801
It was a,

4415
01:47:07,801 --> 01:47:09,990
it was a big deal and it was very,

4416
01:47:10,020 --> 01:47:13,230
it was very sad for a lot of people
that were Arturo Gotti fans because

4417
01:47:14,730 --> 01:47:16,860
his fights with Micky ward were,

4418
01:47:17,220 --> 01:47:20,460
there's fights where guys
are matched perfectly,

4419
01:47:20,670 --> 01:47:22,860
where it's like their skill level.

4420
01:47:22,920 --> 01:47:25,640
We're talking about a Turo Gadi
and Micky Ward and how God,

4421
01:47:25,650 --> 01:47:28,050
he was a pat Miletich
returns from the restroom.

4422
01:47:28,290 --> 01:47:29,640
How God he was,

4423
01:47:29,641 --> 01:47:30,390
um,

4424
01:47:30,390 --> 01:47:32,010
killed by his girlfriend or his wife.

4425
01:47:32,040 --> 01:47:32,580
Right.

4426
01:47:32,580 --> 01:47:33,750
And acquitted.

4427
01:47:33,930 --> 01:47:37,080
She was acquitted and it's like pretty
obvious it's someone murdered them and

4428
01:47:37,081 --> 01:47:38,490
they pass it off as a,

4429
01:47:38,491 --> 01:47:39,324
uh,

4430
01:47:39,480 --> 01:47:42,090
as a suicide and then because
of domestic or something.

4431
01:47:42,180 --> 01:47:42,780
No,

4432
01:47:42,780 --> 01:47:43,290
no.

4433
01:47:43,290 --> 01:47:44,330
She fucking killed him,

4434
01:47:44,331 --> 01:47:44,940
man.

4435
01:47:44,940 --> 01:47:46,410
And when she got out of jail,

4436
01:47:46,411 --> 01:47:47,550
she was smiling.

4437
01:47:47,551 --> 01:47:48,240
She's like,

4438
01:47:48,240 --> 01:47:49,230
she's like taking,

4439
01:47:49,260 --> 01:47:51,660
they're taking pictures
of her leaving jail.

4440
01:47:51,780 --> 01:47:53,820
I think there's just a Brazil job.

4441
01:47:53,850 --> 01:47:56,610
I couldn't you no
corruption in Brazil is bad,

4442
01:47:56,670 --> 01:47:57,211
is bad.

4443
01:47:57,211 --> 01:47:57,540
I mean,

4444
01:47:57,540 --> 01:47:59,610
they tried to get rid of the
fucking president recently.

4445
01:47:59,700 --> 01:48:00,180
Right?

4446
01:48:00,180 --> 01:48:01,170
I don't know what happened with that.

4447
01:48:01,200 --> 01:48:02,640
They were just stealing money,

4448
01:48:02,910 --> 01:48:03,370
period.

4449
01:48:03,370 --> 01:48:03,870
Right.

4450
01:48:03,870 --> 01:48:08,040
There's some severe corruption in Brazil
and apparently in this case most people

4451
01:48:08,041 --> 01:48:11,190
think that she killed him and
that she got away with it.

4452
01:48:11,191 --> 01:48:11,640
Yeah.

4453
01:48:11,640 --> 01:48:13,830
To get an understanding too
of the Brazilian people,

4454
01:48:13,831 --> 01:48:15,200
you have to read a book called um,

4455
01:48:15,390 --> 01:48:16,223
to Guerrero.

4456
01:48:16,810 --> 01:48:17,420
Never heard of that.

4457
01:48:17,420 --> 01:48:18,253
No,

4458
01:48:18,480 --> 01:48:19,800
I saw the city of God though.

4459
01:48:20,280 --> 01:48:20,700
Yeah.

4460
01:48:20,700 --> 01:48:23,070
You want to understand fucking Brazilians.

4461
01:48:23,071 --> 01:48:23,761
Watch that movie.

4462
01:48:23,761 --> 01:48:24,510
City of God.

4463
01:48:24,510 --> 01:48:25,201
I've never heard of it.

4464
01:48:25,201 --> 01:48:26,310
Holy Shit.

4465
01:48:26,840 --> 01:48:27,830
It was just tell me about this movie.

4466
01:48:27,831 --> 01:48:28,970
And so ultra,

4467
01:48:29,050 --> 01:48:34,050
ultra rare or to Guerrero was a book
about Sasha and Ernst Simmel to Russians

4468
01:48:34,531 --> 01:48:39,531
who had engineering degrees who went
to Brazil around 1920 1921 during the

4469
01:48:39,901 --> 01:48:40,734
diamond rush.

4470
01:48:40,770 --> 01:48:41,603
Right.

4471
01:48:41,820 --> 01:48:42,750
And this was when,

4472
01:48:42,780 --> 01:48:44,380
ironically I think when the,

4473
01:48:44,420 --> 01:48:46,200
the Gracie started learning Jujitsu,

4474
01:48:46,380 --> 01:48:47,940
right about the same,

4475
01:48:47,941 --> 01:48:48,870
about the same area.

4476
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:53,580
So Ernst and Sasha [inaudible] both were
catch wrestling guys and boxers and it

4477
01:48:53,581 --> 01:48:54,720
just tough Russians,

4478
01:48:54,840 --> 01:48:55,160
right.

4479
01:48:55,160 --> 01:48:56,400
We know how tough Russians are.

4480
01:48:57,240 --> 01:48:58,073
So anyway,

4481
01:48:58,740 --> 01:49:02,370
they are working their way through
Brazil and through the Mato Grosso,

4482
01:49:02,371 --> 01:49:04,860
stopping at ranches and towns fixing guns.

4483
01:49:05,160 --> 01:49:08,970
Cause the Brazilians didn't know how to
fix our guns to pay their way further in

4484
01:49:09,120 --> 01:49:11,700
as they were getting towards the
rivers and all that sort of stuff.

4485
01:49:11,770 --> 01:49:14,130
And to find diamonds is
that that was our thing.

4486
01:49:14,760 --> 01:49:15,930
But during all of this,

4487
01:49:16,920 --> 01:49:17,610
uh,

4488
01:49:17,610 --> 01:49:19,860
Sasha semel was fighting,

4489
01:49:20,210 --> 01:49:24,300
no holds barred fights against Paraguayan
strong men and all this sort of stuff

4490
01:49:24,830 --> 01:49:25,340
in,

4491
01:49:25,340 --> 01:49:25,801
in the ring.

4492
01:49:25,801 --> 01:49:30,330
And then he became a guy who was what's
called a to guerrera guy who can use a

4493
01:49:30,331 --> 01:49:33,390
spear and kill one of the big cats in the
jungles back then that was killing the

4494
01:49:33,391 --> 01:49:34,224
cattle,

4495
01:49:34,260 --> 01:49:35,550
killing the ranch hands,

4496
01:49:35,551 --> 01:49:36,181
all this sort of stuff.

4497
01:49:36,181 --> 01:49:37,380
These are 400 pound cats,

4498
01:49:37,381 --> 01:49:37,980
right?

4499
01:49:37,980 --> 01:49:39,990
These are big scary
panthers in the jungle.

4500
01:49:40,500 --> 01:49:43,710
So he went and sought out and found a,

4501
01:49:44,400 --> 01:49:48,220
a Indian or Brazilian
Indian who was supposedly

4502
01:49:48,220 --> 01:49:48,311
a,

4503
01:49:48,311 --> 01:49:49,360
took rare the expert.

4504
01:49:49,450 --> 01:49:51,640
And he found this guy
and the guy's just drunk,

4505
01:49:51,730 --> 01:49:52,630
just completely drunk.

4506
01:49:53,110 --> 01:49:53,411
And he goes,

4507
01:49:53,411 --> 01:49:55,630
I want you to take me and
teach me how to do this.

4508
01:49:55,720 --> 01:49:59,320
And so they go and the guys
drinking the whole time and he goes,

4509
01:49:59,380 --> 01:50:01,210
they run across a big cat.

4510
01:50:01,211 --> 01:50:05,620
And what these cats would do is riflemen
on horses would go track the cats,

4511
01:50:06,160 --> 01:50:07,510
the cats would double back on them,

4512
01:50:07,630 --> 01:50:08,800
take them off their horse and kill them,

4513
01:50:08,920 --> 01:50:09,191
right?

4514
01:50:09,191 --> 01:50:10,270
So they were killing rifleman.

4515
01:50:10,450 --> 01:50:11,650
So these cats were smart.

4516
01:50:12,850 --> 01:50:14,350
So this guy taught him though.

4517
01:50:14,351 --> 01:50:17,710
He watched this guy drunk kill
a 400 pound cat with a spear.

4518
01:50:18,070 --> 01:50:20,260
And then he taught him how
they would sit on their paws,

4519
01:50:20,261 --> 01:50:21,790
whether they were going
high to attack you,

4520
01:50:21,791 --> 01:50:22,900
whether they were coming low,

4521
01:50:22,901 --> 01:50:24,040
how to position the spear,

4522
01:50:24,041 --> 01:50:24,874
all that sort of stuff.

4523
01:50:25,510 --> 01:50:26,190
So,

4524
01:50:26,190 --> 01:50:26,590
uh,

4525
01:50:26,590 --> 01:50:30,700
Sasha semel became a white guy who'd
killed 33 big cats for ranches,

4526
01:50:30,850 --> 01:50:31,180
right?

4527
01:50:31,180 --> 01:50:32,580
Why this beer?

4528
01:50:32,630 --> 01:50:32,980
Yeah,

4529
01:50:32,980 --> 01:50:33,761
it's the coolest.

4530
01:50:33,761 --> 01:50:34,361
It's the coolest,

4531
01:50:34,361 --> 01:50:35,560
but you couldn't write it any better.

4532
01:50:35,561 --> 01:50:38,140
But to tell you about
the Brazilian mindset,

4533
01:50:38,170 --> 01:50:39,400
there was a guy in one of the,

4534
01:50:40,010 --> 01:50:40,331
uh,

4535
01:50:40,331 --> 01:50:45,331
gun Smith blacksmith shops where they
were fixing guns for people that this one

4536
01:50:45,941 --> 01:50:50,140
Brazilian had an attitude and Sasha
insulted him in front of the friends.

4537
01:50:50,530 --> 01:50:51,520
So this guy,

4538
01:50:51,640 --> 01:50:54,190
then once you insulted
Brazilian back in those days,

4539
01:50:54,191 --> 01:50:54,670
especially,

4540
01:50:54,670 --> 01:50:57,520
they have to kill you because
you disrespected them so
badly in front of their

4541
01:50:57,521 --> 01:50:59,540
family and friends and that that's,

4542
01:50:59,590 --> 01:51:00,670
they're just hot blooded people,

4543
01:51:00,671 --> 01:51:01,360
right?

4544
01:51:01,360 --> 01:51:02,780
You've been around enough resilience.

4545
01:51:02,800 --> 01:51:03,850
They're hot blooded people,

4546
01:51:03,851 --> 01:51:05,560
a Vandelay Silva when he loses his temper,

4547
01:51:05,561 --> 01:51:06,670
and it's a pretty scary dude.

4548
01:51:07,660 --> 01:51:12,100
So this guy tracks them for awhile and
then they hire a guy that's the sheriff

4549
01:51:12,101 --> 01:51:16,750
of Pasa Fundo who has a necklace of human
ears to prove he brings back the ears

4550
01:51:16,751 --> 01:51:18,100
of the person you paid him to kill,

4551
01:51:18,610 --> 01:51:19,780
and that's how he got paid.

4552
01:51:19,900 --> 01:51:20,141
Right?

4553
01:51:20,141 --> 01:51:22,780
So he had a necklace of human
ears and he was hunting Sasha,

4554
01:51:22,840 --> 01:51:23,081
or it's,

4555
01:51:23,081 --> 01:51:24,310
it's the coolest book you've ever read.

4556
01:51:24,670 --> 01:51:25,180
Wow.

4557
01:51:25,180 --> 01:51:26,190
It's incredible to her,

4558
01:51:26,590 --> 01:51:28,040
to Grerrero Tig,

4559
01:51:28,320 --> 01:51:28,720
r.

4560
01:51:28,720 --> 01:51:30,400
E.

4561
01:51:30,400 --> 01:51:30,400
R.

4562
01:51:30,400 --> 01:51:31,233
O,

4563
01:51:31,270 --> 01:51:32,230
but it's a rare book.

4564
01:51:32,520 --> 01:51:33,400
A friend of mine,

4565
01:51:33,500 --> 01:51:34,800
Amsti Tig,

4566
01:51:34,810 --> 01:51:35,940
r e R.

4567
01:51:35,941 --> 01:51:36,240
O.

4568
01:51:36,240 --> 01:51:36,670
R.

4569
01:51:36,670 --> 01:51:37,060
O.

4570
01:51:37,060 --> 01:51:37,893
Two Guerrero.

4571
01:51:38,080 --> 01:51:38,891
It's a rare book.

4572
01:51:38,891 --> 01:51:39,730
It's hard to find,

4573
01:51:39,820 --> 01:51:42,640
and John Wayne was going
to make a movie about it,

4574
01:51:43,240 --> 01:51:44,680
but they couldn't do the movie.

4575
01:51:44,740 --> 01:51:46,720
They were going to do it in
the 50s or whatever it was,

4576
01:51:47,140 --> 01:51:49,450
but they couldn't because the
Amazon was still too dangerous.

4577
01:51:49,660 --> 01:51:52,160
There's cannibals everywhere and
all kinds of stuff and you know,

4578
01:51:52,180 --> 01:51:53,530
malaria and everything else.

4579
01:51:53,531 --> 01:51:54,310
So they,

4580
01:51:54,310 --> 01:51:59,310
there's actually a documentary about
going there to do the site surveys and all

4581
01:51:59,501 --> 01:52:00,101
that sort of stuff.

4582
01:52:00,101 --> 01:52:00,800
And they went,

4583
01:52:00,800 --> 01:52:02,560
you have malaria and South America?

4584
01:52:02,950 --> 01:52:03,520
I think so.

4585
01:52:03,520 --> 01:52:03,791
It's not,

4586
01:52:03,791 --> 01:52:06,760
malaria is just an Amazon in
the Amazon and stuff like that.

4587
01:52:07,060 --> 01:52:07,893
Right.

4588
01:52:07,950 --> 01:52:09,320
I'm sure they've got plenty of diseases,

4589
01:52:09,560 --> 01:52:09,921
but yeah,

4590
01:52:09,921 --> 01:52:10,520
the cannibals,

4591
01:52:10,520 --> 01:52:11,660
that's like what got that,

4592
01:52:11,750 --> 01:52:14,960
that explore that English
explorer and the lost city of Z.

4593
01:52:14,960 --> 01:52:15,310
Right.

4594
01:52:15,310 --> 01:52:15,620
I,

4595
01:52:15,620 --> 01:52:16,341
I've never heard of that.

4596
01:52:16,341 --> 01:52:16,880
Yeah.

4597
01:52:16,880 --> 01:52:20,660
The Lost City of Z is a book that they
turned into a movie a couple of years ago

4598
01:52:20,840 --> 01:52:25,370
about this guy and it turned out that
what he had discovered has now been proven

4599
01:52:25,371 --> 01:52:27,740
that there was some ancient systems.

4600
01:52:27,741 --> 01:52:28,310
They're a,

4601
01:52:28,310 --> 01:52:29,143
some ancient,

4602
01:52:29,800 --> 01:52:30,240
uh,

4603
01:52:30,240 --> 01:52:31,010
civilizations,

4604
01:52:31,010 --> 01:52:31,821
civilization,

4605
01:52:31,821 --> 01:52:33,710
but also irrigation systems.

4606
01:52:33,711 --> 01:52:34,091
And they've,

4607
01:52:34,091 --> 01:52:37,430
they've figured out that they had all
these roads and stuff because of satellite

4608
01:52:37,431 --> 01:52:41,960
imagery there and some new technology
where they can look through the bushes and

4609
01:52:41,961 --> 01:52:42,291
all the,

4610
01:52:42,291 --> 01:52:45,650
the jungle foliage and stuff and these and

4611
01:52:46,070 --> 01:52:46,903
roads and everything.

4612
01:52:47,410 --> 01:52:48,120
Dude,

4613
01:52:48,120 --> 01:52:48,870
that's,

4614
01:52:48,870 --> 01:52:49,160
yeah,

4615
01:52:49,160 --> 01:52:49,940
there he is.

4616
01:52:49,940 --> 01:52:50,773
That's him.

4617
01:52:50,780 --> 01:52:51,980
Is that a spear right next to him?

4618
01:52:51,981 --> 01:52:53,500
There's pictures of gunner,

4619
01:52:53,510 --> 01:52:55,180
a spear gun with a bandit on it.

4620
01:52:55,280 --> 01:52:55,580
Oh.

4621
01:52:55,580 --> 01:53:00,470
But there's pictures of him with spears
going up against cats to Jesus Christ.

4622
01:53:00,471 --> 01:53:01,304
Dude,

4623
01:53:02,120 --> 01:53:02,960
he was hardcore,

4624
01:53:02,961 --> 01:53:03,794
man.

4625
01:53:04,040 --> 01:53:05,690
There's this beer that's a spear,

4626
01:53:05,870 --> 01:53:07,160
but it's a fucking animal.

4627
01:53:07,700 --> 01:53:08,720
Jesus cried.

4628
01:53:08,721 --> 01:53:09,650
That's so crazy.

4629
01:53:09,651 --> 01:53:10,251
I think about that.

4630
01:53:10,251 --> 01:53:11,270
I spoke to his son.

4631
01:53:11,271 --> 01:53:11,510
I was,

4632
01:53:11,510 --> 01:53:12,343
I was,

4633
01:53:12,500 --> 01:53:15,110
I was writing the screenplay on his life.

4634
01:53:15,260 --> 01:53:15,890
Wow.

4635
01:53:15,890 --> 01:53:17,000
And I talked to his son,

4636
01:53:17,001 --> 01:53:18,950
Sasha junior about it.

4637
01:53:19,100 --> 01:53:20,120
And um,

4638
01:53:20,270 --> 01:53:23,390
he eventually just didn't want to do
the life rights thing and all that.

4639
01:53:23,391 --> 01:53:25,400
And what if the eight though the Jaguars,

4640
01:53:25,790 --> 01:53:26,660
I have no idea.

4641
01:53:27,520 --> 01:53:28,670
Do you know mountain lions?

4642
01:53:28,671 --> 01:53:29,504
Delicious?

4643
01:53:29,660 --> 01:53:30,493
Is it?

4644
01:53:30,530 --> 01:53:31,550
I have people that say so.

4645
01:53:31,551 --> 01:53:32,450
Their favorite food.

4646
01:53:32,510 --> 01:53:32,960
Really?

4647
01:53:32,960 --> 01:53:33,793
Yeah.

4648
01:53:33,950 --> 01:53:34,281
Yeah.

4649
01:53:34,281 --> 01:53:36,110
I had no idea you could even eat it,

4650
01:53:36,111 --> 01:53:39,020
but it's apparently a more
delicious version of pork.

4651
01:53:39,200 --> 01:53:39,680
Wow.

4652
01:53:39,680 --> 01:53:39,921
Yeah.

4653
01:53:39,921 --> 01:53:42,230
It's supposed to be
fantastic mountain mine loin,

4654
01:53:42,260 --> 01:53:43,310
like the back loin.

4655
01:53:43,370 --> 01:53:45,080
Backstrap a mountain lion.

4656
01:53:45,370 --> 01:53:45,981
A mountain lion.

4657
01:53:45,981 --> 01:53:46,250
Yeah.

4658
01:53:46,250 --> 01:53:47,660
There's things I'll
eat and things I won't,

4659
01:53:47,661 --> 01:53:48,890
I don't know if I'd eat a predator.

4660
01:53:48,920 --> 01:53:50,410
I eat the fuck out of a mountain line.

4661
01:53:50,590 --> 01:53:50,910
Yeah,

4662
01:53:50,910 --> 01:53:51,680
like them.

4663
01:53:51,680 --> 01:53:52,513
Yeah.

4664
01:53:52,910 --> 01:53:54,770
When I'm killed my dog
when I lived in Colorado.

4665
01:53:54,800 --> 01:53:55,440
Really?

4666
01:53:55,440 --> 01:53:55,930
Yeah.

4667
01:53:55,930 --> 01:53:56,091
Yeah,

4668
01:53:56,091 --> 01:53:56,780
I've seen,

4669
01:53:56,780 --> 01:53:57,890
I've seen two of them.

4670
01:53:57,920 --> 01:54:00,620
I saw that one and I saw one
of them in Santa Barbara.

4671
01:54:00,900 --> 01:54:01,060
Oh,

4672
01:54:01,060 --> 01:54:03,830
it's actually driving through
Monosito real nice neighborhood,

4673
01:54:03,831 --> 01:54:07,070
and I saw this thing run across the road
and at first I thought it was a coyote.

4674
01:54:07,350 --> 01:54:08,840
Then it saw the tail and I went,

4675
01:54:08,870 --> 01:54:09,681
Oh shit,

4676
01:54:09,681 --> 01:54:10,514
that's a cat.

4677
01:54:10,580 --> 01:54:10,940
Wow.

4678
01:54:10,940 --> 01:54:12,230
Then I realized it was the mount cat.

4679
01:54:12,440 --> 01:54:13,131
Not that big.

4680
01:54:13,131 --> 01:54:13,910
No.

4681
01:54:13,910 --> 01:54:15,190
50 60 pounds.

4682
01:54:15,860 --> 01:54:17,560
There's obviously some
massive ones out there.

4683
01:54:17,630 --> 01:54:18,770
Fucking giant ones.

4684
01:54:18,771 --> 01:54:18,920
Yeah.

4685
01:54:18,920 --> 01:54:19,280
Yeah.

4686
01:54:19,280 --> 01:54:22,130
Colorado's got some fucking
whoppers and the coyotes,

4687
01:54:22,131 --> 01:54:23,870
the coyotes where I live there,

4688
01:54:24,170 --> 01:54:24,860
they're everywhere.

4689
01:54:24,860 --> 01:54:27,530
You ever see the picture of the one
we were supposed to get that whatever

4690
01:54:27,531 --> 01:54:28,161
happened with that,

4691
01:54:28,161 --> 01:54:28,520
the one,

4692
01:54:28,520 --> 01:54:30,350
the Hollywood sign with the cat,

4693
01:54:30,351 --> 01:54:30,910
with the,

4694
01:54:30,910 --> 01:54:31,200
the,

4695
01:54:31,200 --> 01:54:32,270
we were supposed to buy that.

4696
01:54:32,300 --> 01:54:33,133
I need to get,

4697
01:54:33,350 --> 01:54:34,370
I found the place to get it.

4698
01:54:34,430 --> 01:54:35,000
Yeah.

4699
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:35,833
Let me,

4700
01:54:35,840 --> 01:54:36,371
let me read it.

4701
01:54:36,371 --> 01:54:40,970
Visit that and buy that thing because
there's an iconic photo to me that just

4702
01:54:41,240 --> 01:54:46,240
symbolizes our intrusion into the
wild world and the consequences of it.

4703
01:54:47,120 --> 01:54:52,040
There's an enormous cat that lives in the
Hollywood hills and there's a photo of

4704
01:54:52,041 --> 01:54:52,370
him.

4705
01:54:52,370 --> 01:54:52,911
Look at this.

4706
01:54:52,911 --> 01:54:54,530
This is taken by camera trap.

4707
01:54:54,531 --> 01:54:55,580
This is a real photo.

4708
01:54:55,680 --> 01:54:56,010
Wow.

4709
01:54:56,010 --> 01:54:58,490
This fucking cat got tags on it.

4710
01:54:58,491 --> 01:54:59,330
You got Colorado them.

4711
01:54:59,660 --> 01:55:00,590
They know the cat.

4712
01:55:00,620 --> 01:55:01,453
I had a,

4713
01:55:01,970 --> 01:55:02,780
I forgot the guy's name.

4714
01:55:02,780 --> 01:55:04,850
The gentleman that we talked
about the other day that was,

4715
01:55:04,851 --> 01:55:05,120
oh,

4716
01:55:05,120 --> 01:55:05,630
the,

4717
01:55:05,630 --> 01:55:08,810
the ranger was explained
to us how they do it.

4718
01:55:08,811 --> 01:55:12,210
They have to dart this fucker every
couple of years when the chase battery's

4719
01:55:12,230 --> 01:55:12,610
dead.

4720
01:55:12,610 --> 01:55:13,130
Yeah.

4721
01:55:13,130 --> 01:55:14,030
So every couple of years,

4722
01:55:14,031 --> 01:55:15,510
this guy goes into fucking dreamland,

4723
01:55:15,560 --> 01:55:16,490
like George Saint Pierre.

4724
01:55:16,970 --> 01:55:17,510
And uh,

4725
01:55:17,510 --> 01:55:19,940
I lost the time and comes back.

4726
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:20,091
Oh,

4727
01:55:20,091 --> 01:55:21,110
there's him with a deer.

4728
01:55:21,620 --> 01:55:22,160
Oh Wow.

4729
01:55:22,160 --> 01:55:22,993
Yeah.

4730
01:55:23,060 --> 01:55:23,841
It's like digging a hole,

4731
01:55:23,841 --> 01:55:24,410
I guess.

4732
01:55:24,410 --> 01:55:25,580
Now the coyotes are ruthless.

4733
01:55:25,581 --> 01:55:26,061
Where I live,

4734
01:55:26,061 --> 01:55:26,301
man,

4735
01:55:26,301 --> 01:55:27,130
they're everywhere.

4736
01:55:27,130 --> 01:55:27,963
They're fucking everywhere.

4737
01:55:27,970 --> 01:55:29,930
When killed my chicken just two days ago.

4738
01:55:29,960 --> 01:55:30,380
Oh really?

4739
01:55:30,380 --> 01:55:30,591
Yeah.

4740
01:55:30,591 --> 01:55:31,231
I have chickens.

4741
01:55:31,231 --> 01:55:31,490
Yeah.

4742
01:55:31,490 --> 01:55:31,781
Yeah.

4743
01:55:31,781 --> 01:55:32,150
It was,

4744
01:55:32,150 --> 01:55:32,660
uh,

4745
01:55:32,660 --> 01:55:33,830
I was out in the backyard.

4746
01:55:33,831 --> 01:55:37,070
So the jump on the roof of the chicken
coop and then jump over the top of the

4747
01:55:37,071 --> 01:55:37,760
fence.

4748
01:55:37,760 --> 01:55:39,560
There's so graceful though.

4749
01:55:39,590 --> 01:55:40,190
They're smart.

4750
01:55:40,190 --> 01:55:41,450
It's all so smart.

4751
01:55:41,451 --> 01:55:41,841
One of my,

4752
01:55:41,841 --> 01:55:43,100
one of my good buddies who,

4753
01:55:44,220 --> 01:55:45,930
he sold his company to Orkin,

4754
01:55:45,931 --> 01:55:48,810
so he was an expert at
getting rid of deer,

4755
01:55:48,811 --> 01:55:49,890
getting rid of Coyote's,

4756
01:55:49,891 --> 01:55:51,500
getting rid of anything off your property,

4757
01:55:51,530 --> 01:55:53,490
getting rid of raccoons out of your house,

4758
01:55:53,491 --> 01:55:53,911
whatever.

4759
01:55:53,911 --> 01:55:54,121
Right.

4760
01:55:54,121 --> 01:55:54,930
He's,

4761
01:55:54,930 --> 01:55:57,630
he's the guy that started
trapping when he was 10 years old.

4762
01:55:57,720 --> 01:55:58,230
Right.

4763
01:55:58,230 --> 01:56:00,300
And some of my buddies did
that and he was one of them,

4764
01:56:00,690 --> 01:56:01,680
but he became the expert,

4765
01:56:01,681 --> 01:56:03,810
sold his company to
Oregon for a lot of money.

4766
01:56:04,840 --> 01:56:07,710
But he is the first and foremost
guy besides one other guy,

4767
01:56:07,711 --> 01:56:12,210
I think world worldwide that is
the expert in trapping coyotes.

4768
01:56:12,211 --> 01:56:13,470
And when he explains it to you,

4769
01:56:13,471 --> 01:56:14,304
you sit there and go,

4770
01:56:14,610 --> 01:56:16,150
how smart are these?

4771
01:56:16,151 --> 01:56:17,880
And if there's anything out of place,

4772
01:56:17,881 --> 01:56:20,220
they never take the same
way back to their den ever.

4773
01:56:20,520 --> 01:56:21,840
They always go a different route.

4774
01:56:21,841 --> 01:56:24,700
They're smart about covering
their tracks and to trap him.

4775
01:56:24,730 --> 01:56:25,440
He goes,

4776
01:56:25,440 --> 01:56:26,880
if you do one thing wrong,

4777
01:56:27,080 --> 01:56:27,690
they,

4778
01:56:27,690 --> 01:56:29,400
they recognize it right
away and they're gone.

4779
01:56:29,820 --> 01:56:31,860
So he had to go and really study,

4780
01:56:31,861 --> 01:56:34,620
research and disagree years by Dan Flores.

4781
01:56:34,621 --> 01:56:36,030
It's called Coyote America.

4782
01:56:36,120 --> 01:56:36,840
And uh,

4783
01:56:36,840 --> 01:56:37,673
Dan is a,

4784
01:56:37,950 --> 01:56:38,890
he's a professor at,

4785
01:56:38,891 --> 01:56:41,280
I think it was he from
university in New Mexico.

4786
01:56:41,670 --> 01:56:42,810
He's from New Mexico,

4787
01:56:43,140 --> 01:56:44,160
genius guy.

4788
01:56:44,220 --> 01:56:49,220
But he went into great detail about how
intelligent these fucking things I about

4789
01:56:49,471 --> 01:56:51,840
how native Americans used
to think they were gods.

4790
01:56:52,210 --> 01:56:54,900
They were tricksters and
they're basically wolves.

4791
01:56:55,050 --> 01:56:55,950
There are small wolf.

4792
01:56:55,980 --> 01:56:56,281
Miniature,

4793
01:56:56,281 --> 01:56:56,540
yeah,

4794
01:56:56,540 --> 01:56:56,910
yeah.

4795
01:56:56,910 --> 01:56:57,743
They're just a miniature,

4796
01:56:57,910 --> 01:56:58,730
super intelligent.

4797
01:56:58,730 --> 01:56:59,250
And I,

4798
01:56:59,250 --> 01:57:02,430
my old house that I had that
had some timber on it and stuff.

4799
01:57:03,510 --> 01:57:05,790
I had a fox down across
the creek on the hillside,

4800
01:57:05,791 --> 01:57:06,361
the five watts,

4801
01:57:06,361 --> 01:57:06,660
a hawk,

4802
01:57:06,660 --> 01:57:09,660
Fox coming back with squirrels and
rabbits every morning at four or five when

4803
01:57:09,661 --> 01:57:10,490
that'd be up to get warm,

4804
01:57:10,490 --> 01:57:11,251
get workouts in,

4805
01:57:11,251 --> 01:57:12,150
they'd be drinking coffee.

4806
01:57:12,510 --> 01:57:15,060
I'd have Turkey vultures
on my frigging Turkey.

4807
01:57:15,061 --> 01:57:16,200
Vultures are this big man.

4808
01:57:16,201 --> 01:57:17,034
They're massive.

4809
01:57:17,100 --> 01:57:18,790
And they'd sit on the railing of my,

4810
01:57:18,820 --> 01:57:19,290
my pad,

4811
01:57:19,290 --> 01:57:20,340
my porch outside.

4812
01:57:20,341 --> 01:57:20,551
You know,

4813
01:57:20,551 --> 01:57:20,790
my,

4814
01:57:20,790 --> 01:57:22,080
I hear my wife scream,

4815
01:57:22,710 --> 01:57:23,670
just shriek and go,

4816
01:57:23,671 --> 01:57:24,504
Jesus,

4817
01:57:24,870 --> 01:57:25,171
I go,

4818
01:57:25,171 --> 01:57:25,471
what?

4819
01:57:25,471 --> 01:57:25,951
And she goes,

4820
01:57:25,951 --> 01:57:27,540
what the fuck are those things?

4821
01:57:27,960 --> 01:57:29,430
And then she not from around there?

4822
01:57:29,490 --> 01:57:29,641
No,

4823
01:57:29,641 --> 01:57:30,570
she's from Montreal.

4824
01:57:30,640 --> 01:57:32,730
A first language is French.

4825
01:57:32,731 --> 01:57:33,421
He was a city girl.

4826
01:57:33,421 --> 01:57:37,680
All that sort of style that he brought
it to ILS while she was studying to be a

4827
01:57:37,681 --> 01:57:39,950
doctor of Chiropractic and in,

4828
01:57:40,050 --> 01:57:40,260
uh,

4829
01:57:40,260 --> 01:57:40,920
at Palmer,

4830
01:57:40,920 --> 01:57:41,701
which was in Davenport,

4831
01:57:41,701 --> 01:57:42,510
Iowa.

4832
01:57:42,510 --> 01:57:43,343
And uh,

4833
01:57:43,680 --> 01:57:44,280
so,

4834
01:57:44,280 --> 01:57:44,551
you know,

4835
01:57:44,551 --> 01:57:45,210
the thing is though,

4836
01:57:45,210 --> 01:57:46,350
I had eagles,

4837
01:57:46,380 --> 01:57:46,921
owls,

4838
01:57:46,921 --> 01:57:48,150
hawks herds,

4839
01:57:48,151 --> 01:57:48,660
a deer,

4840
01:57:48,660 --> 01:57:49,291
coyotes,

4841
01:57:49,291 --> 01:57:51,750
all kinds of crazy stuff running
through my yard constantly.

4842
01:57:52,050 --> 01:57:55,080
And that's when I had the mastiff and
a and a shepherd and some other stuff

4843
01:57:55,081 --> 01:57:55,620
that,

4844
01:57:55,620 --> 01:57:56,390
uh,

4845
01:57:56,390 --> 01:57:56,670
you know,

4846
01:57:56,670 --> 01:57:57,750
my master for one of the killer,

4847
01:57:57,770 --> 01:58:01,620
everything that came into my heart
for sure a big ass dog like that.

4848
01:58:01,890 --> 01:58:02,820
I was the,

4849
01:58:02,970 --> 01:58:06,390
that's like one of the best places
in the world for whitetail deer.

4850
01:58:06,420 --> 01:58:06,960
They're huge.

4851
01:58:06,960 --> 01:58:07,741
I have a buddy of mine,

4852
01:58:07,741 --> 01:58:08,790
my friend John Dudley,

4853
01:58:08,791 --> 01:58:10,830
he bought a farm out in Iowa.

4854
01:58:10,831 --> 01:58:11,830
Just a hunt whitetail.

4855
01:58:11,930 --> 01:58:12,131
Yeah.

4856
01:58:12,131 --> 01:58:13,340
So the,

4857
01:58:13,640 --> 01:58:18,210
the military farm is down in southern
Iowa and my grandma on the other side,

4858
01:58:18,211 --> 01:58:19,800
her farm was down there also.

4859
01:58:19,830 --> 01:58:20,310
And it's,

4860
01:58:20,310 --> 01:58:20,670
you know,

4861
01:58:20,670 --> 01:58:22,110
obviously a lot of timber also,

4862
01:58:22,111 --> 01:58:24,030
and it's the deer you see down there.

4863
01:58:24,031 --> 01:58:24,864
And even,

4864
01:58:24,900 --> 01:58:25,201
you know,

4865
01:58:25,201 --> 01:58:26,820
in Bettendorf Iowa where I live,

4866
01:58:26,821 --> 01:58:28,230
which is right next to
the Mississippi river,

4867
01:58:28,231 --> 01:58:29,880
the deer are huge.

4868
01:58:30,210 --> 01:58:32,580
I see a deer in Texas and they
looked like a German shepherd.

4869
01:58:32,640 --> 01:58:32,911
Yeah.

4870
01:58:32,911 --> 01:58:33,481
It's interesting,

4871
01:58:33,481 --> 01:58:33,840
right?

4872
01:58:33,840 --> 01:58:34,111
It's,

4873
01:58:34,111 --> 01:58:34,801
you know what that is?

4874
01:58:34,801 --> 01:58:37,800
That's the warmth and the porn principle.

4875
01:58:37,830 --> 01:58:38,391
There's that too,

4876
01:58:38,391 --> 01:58:38,881
as corn,

4877
01:58:38,881 --> 01:58:39,510
soybeans,

4878
01:58:39,510 --> 01:58:40,240
all that sort of stuff.

4879
01:58:40,240 --> 01:58:41,530
They're well fed all the time.

4880
01:58:41,890 --> 01:58:42,480
And they,

4881
01:58:42,480 --> 01:58:43,030
uh,

4882
01:58:43,030 --> 01:58:44,050
did I hit a deer?

4883
01:58:44,320 --> 01:58:44,621
What was it,

4884
01:58:44,621 --> 01:58:46,810
a year and a half ago with
my F-150 and all it was,

4885
01:58:46,811 --> 01:58:51,070
was his chest hit the front quarter up
front of the quarter panel and scraped

4886
01:58:51,071 --> 01:58:52,930
down at and destroy the
whole side of my truck.

4887
01:58:53,110 --> 01:58:53,943
Just destroyed it.

4888
01:58:53,980 --> 01:58:54,670
They're that big.

4889
01:58:54,670 --> 01:58:55,420
They're tanks.

4890
01:58:55,420 --> 01:58:55,811
Yeah.

4891
01:58:55,811 --> 01:58:57,070
Now imagine hitting a moose.

4892
01:58:57,730 --> 01:59:00,220
My Dad hit a moose almost killing Jesus.

4893
01:59:00,310 --> 01:59:00,770
It,

4894
01:59:00,770 --> 01:59:01,090
it,

4895
01:59:01,090 --> 01:59:01,320
uh,

4896
01:59:01,320 --> 01:59:06,320
the vehicle caught on fire because the
moose crushed into the engine compartment

4897
01:59:06,760 --> 01:59:10,100
and caved in the front of the vehicle
and then it all caught on fire.

4898
01:59:10,101 --> 01:59:12,560
And my dad had the to and go out the
kick the back of window off to get out

4899
01:59:12,610 --> 01:59:13,840
Jesus Christ.

4900
01:59:14,470 --> 01:59:15,520
And if you hawk it a moose,

4901
01:59:15,521 --> 01:59:16,960
if you stop and then Hawk it a moose,

4902
01:59:16,961 --> 01:59:17,794
I'll kick your ass.

4903
01:59:17,800 --> 01:59:19,510
They'll run in and smash your car.

4904
01:59:19,810 --> 01:59:20,140
Yeah.

4905
01:59:20,140 --> 01:59:22,000
So you've just seen a moose.

4906
01:59:22,450 --> 01:59:23,560
I went on a fishing trip,

4907
01:59:23,590 --> 01:59:26,080
one of the many fishing trips I went
on in Canada with a friend of mine,

4908
01:59:26,081 --> 01:59:26,914
Mark Lewis,

4909
01:59:27,460 --> 01:59:29,530
and we were in a v bottom boat.

4910
01:59:29,680 --> 01:59:32,320
There was three of us and we were
going the English river system,

4911
01:59:32,321 --> 01:59:35,350
if you ever want to go fishing
in the summer for bad ass fish,

4912
01:59:35,830 --> 01:59:36,281
I mean you'll,

4913
01:59:36,281 --> 01:59:37,840
you'll wear out catching fish up there.

4914
01:59:37,930 --> 01:59:42,160
It's north of lake of the woods and
we were going across the lake and the

4915
01:59:42,161 --> 01:59:45,460
English river system is massive and
it's endless amounts of islands.

4916
01:59:45,461 --> 01:59:47,020
You can get lost really easy up there.

4917
01:59:47,500 --> 01:59:51,010
But we were cutting across the lake and
we got into this bay and there was a

4918
01:59:51,011 --> 01:59:52,390
moose swimming across the band,

4919
01:59:52,480 --> 01:59:54,250
you know the huge rack on
it and everything else.

4920
01:59:54,760 --> 01:59:55,750
And my buddy mark goes,

4921
01:59:55,960 --> 01:59:56,793
pull up next to it.

4922
01:59:58,090 --> 01:59:58,361
He goes,

4923
01:59:58,361 --> 01:59:58,490
yeah,

4924
01:59:58,490 --> 01:59:59,530
just pull up right to its ass.

4925
01:59:59,531 --> 02:00:03,550
And so I pulled up kind of just on its
ass and he jumps out of the boat on its

4926
02:00:03,551 --> 02:00:04,300
back.

4927
02:00:04,300 --> 02:00:05,680
Oh no he did.

4928
02:00:06,790 --> 02:00:07,623
So He's,

4929
02:00:08,010 --> 02:00:10,540
so he's riding on the back of the
Moose and the Moose was doing this,

4930
02:00:10,541 --> 02:00:13,480
trying to get to him and
finally he jumps off,

4931
02:00:13,510 --> 02:00:14,380
climbs back in the boat.

4932
02:00:14,381 --> 02:00:17,770
We turned away and write down the moose
hit shallow ground and came up right

4933
02:00:17,771 --> 02:00:18,820
after he would have been dead.

4934
02:00:18,970 --> 02:00:19,803
He would have been dead.

4935
02:00:22,030 --> 02:00:23,080
Big fucking animal.

4936
02:00:23,140 --> 02:00:23,231
Yeah.

4937
02:00:23,231 --> 02:00:27,250
They're one of the rare deer species
that almost regularly charges people.

4938
02:00:27,280 --> 02:00:27,940
Yeah.

4939
02:00:27,940 --> 02:00:28,120
Yeah.

4940
02:00:28,120 --> 02:00:28,901
They fuck people up.

4941
02:00:28,901 --> 02:00:30,340
All the things run into Duluth,

4942
02:00:30,341 --> 02:00:32,380
Minnesota in downtown and smash everybody.

4943
02:00:32,410 --> 02:00:32,621
Yeah.

4944
02:00:32,621 --> 02:00:33,710
They just stomped people in,

4945
02:00:33,711 --> 02:00:35,410
in Alaska too.

4946
02:00:35,411 --> 02:00:40,120
And it's usually the problem is if you
find them a female that's with our babies

4947
02:00:40,121 --> 02:00:40,570
are done,

4948
02:00:40,570 --> 02:00:41,440
that's when you're in real,

4949
02:00:41,441 --> 02:00:42,011
real trouble.

4950
02:00:42,011 --> 02:00:42,141
Right,

4951
02:00:42,141 --> 02:00:42,370
right.

4952
02:00:42,370 --> 02:00:42,880
Yeah.

4953
02:00:42,880 --> 02:00:43,780
So do you hunt much?

4954
02:00:43,840 --> 02:00:44,081
Yeah,

4955
02:00:44,081 --> 02:00:44,500
a lot.

4956
02:00:44,500 --> 02:00:44,830
Yeah.

4957
02:00:44,830 --> 02:00:45,310
Yeah.

4958
02:00:45,310 --> 02:00:45,850
Where do you,

4959
02:00:45,850 --> 02:00:46,683
where do you hunt usually?

4960
02:00:47,320 --> 02:00:50,050
I've hunted in Iowa hundred
Iowa for whitetail last year.

4961
02:00:50,470 --> 02:00:51,303
Um,

4962
02:00:51,730 --> 02:00:53,090
he's outside of Des Moines.

4963
02:00:53,140 --> 02:00:53,620
Okay.

4964
02:00:53,620 --> 02:00:56,160
About like a 45 minutes
outside of the morning.

4965
02:00:56,370 --> 02:00:57,130
Um,

4966
02:00:57,130 --> 02:00:58,480
I hunt Utah.

4967
02:00:58,510 --> 02:01:00,310
I shot an elk in Utah this year.

4968
02:01:00,700 --> 02:01:01,210
Um,

4969
02:01:01,210 --> 02:01:01,690
I got,

4970
02:01:01,690 --> 02:01:02,051
uh,

4971
02:01:02,051 --> 02:01:03,450
another elk and um,

4972
02:01:03,550 --> 02:01:04,720
central California.

4973
02:01:05,260 --> 02:01:06,370
Um,

4974
02:01:06,460 --> 02:01:08,080
I tried to go to as
many places as possible.

4975
02:01:08,081 --> 02:01:11,090
I'm going next month I'm going
to Lanai for access deer,

4976
02:01:11,560 --> 02:01:13,650
mostly bow hunt during most of the cool.

4977
02:01:13,750 --> 02:01:13,931
Yeah,

4978
02:01:13,931 --> 02:01:14,360
I love it.

4979
02:01:14,360 --> 02:01:15,131
Got a hell of a bow,

4980
02:01:15,131 --> 02:01:16,710
a hunting thing set up in the air.

4981
02:01:16,780 --> 02:01:16,991
Yeah.

4982
02:01:16,991 --> 02:01:18,130
It's pretty bad back there.

4983
02:01:18,140 --> 02:01:18,820
Yeah.

4984
02:01:18,820 --> 02:01:20,340
45 yard indoor range.

4985
02:01:20,440 --> 02:01:21,040
It's cool.

4986
02:01:21,040 --> 02:01:21,600
It's good.

4987
02:01:21,600 --> 02:01:22,433
Keep practice.

4988
02:01:23,080 --> 02:01:24,760
The doctor that I told you about,

4989
02:01:25,180 --> 02:01:25,850
Tyson Cobb,

4990
02:01:25,850 --> 02:01:27,120
the orthopedic surgeon that fixed him,

4991
02:01:27,121 --> 02:01:27,954
his arm,

4992
02:01:28,180 --> 02:01:31,360
he was a bow hunter who went
and got crocodile in Africa,

4993
02:01:31,450 --> 02:01:31,751
you know,

4994
02:01:31,751 --> 02:01:33,140
big old giant games,

4995
02:01:33,141 --> 02:01:33,974
stuff like that.

4996
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:35,500
And um,

4997
02:01:36,130 --> 02:01:36,760
you know,

4998
02:01:36,760 --> 02:01:38,380
the stuff that he haunted was,

4999
02:01:38,410 --> 02:01:39,040
I mean,

5000
02:01:39,040 --> 02:01:39,320
you know,

5001
02:01:39,320 --> 02:01:40,010
killing a grizzly

5002
02:01:40,010 --> 02:01:41,750
with a bow is some scary stuff.

5003
02:01:41,810 --> 02:01:42,021
Yeah.

5004
02:01:42,021 --> 02:01:43,880
That's a real risky proposition.

5005
02:01:43,910 --> 02:01:44,061
Yeah.

5006
02:01:44,061 --> 02:01:44,660
But he did,

5007
02:01:44,660 --> 02:01:45,500
he did stuff like that.

5008
02:01:46,310 --> 02:01:46,760
Yeah.

5009
02:01:46,760 --> 02:01:49,130
My friend Dudley that I was telling
you about that lives in Iowa,

5010
02:01:49,131 --> 02:01:50,270
he does that too.

5011
02:01:50,420 --> 02:01:51,620
He goes all over the world and,

5012
02:01:51,710 --> 02:01:53,120
and hunts you miss.

5013
02:01:53,600 --> 02:01:53,841
Yeah.

5014
02:01:53,841 --> 02:01:54,441
It's very,

5015
02:01:54,441 --> 02:01:55,310
very risky.

5016
02:01:55,550 --> 02:01:56,260
Very risky.

5017
02:01:56,260 --> 02:01:56,690
Right.

5018
02:01:56,690 --> 02:01:57,800
But you know,

5019
02:01:58,310 --> 02:01:59,143
it's,

5020
02:01:59,240 --> 02:02:02,060
the thing about the
grizzly hunting is like,

5021
02:02:03,050 --> 02:02:04,220
people don't like it.

5022
02:02:04,340 --> 02:02:07,520
Like it's gotten to the point
where in BC they've outlawed it,

5023
02:02:07,540 --> 02:02:07,910
right.

5024
02:02:07,910 --> 02:02:08,271
And,

5025
02:02:08,271 --> 02:02:08,480
uh,

5026
02:02:08,480 --> 02:02:10,040
they really shouldn't have.

5027
02:02:10,220 --> 02:02:13,100
And the reason being is that you've
got to control the populations because

5028
02:02:13,101 --> 02:02:15,860
there's nothing that eats
them like except them.

5029
02:02:16,300 --> 02:02:17,360
They're all cannibals.

5030
02:02:17,390 --> 02:02:18,051
All Grizzlies,

5031
02:02:18,051 --> 02:02:18,291
all,

5032
02:02:18,291 --> 02:02:19,760
even black bears are all cannibals.

5033
02:02:19,790 --> 02:02:20,100
Sticky.

5034
02:02:20,100 --> 02:02:20,930
The cubs,

5035
02:02:20,930 --> 02:02:21,950
the cubs all the time.

5036
02:02:22,070 --> 02:02:23,120
And if one of them dies,

5037
02:02:23,121 --> 02:02:23,870
like if you,

5038
02:02:23,870 --> 02:02:27,110
I've been black bear hunting before and
if you shoot a black bear and like maybe

5039
02:02:27,111 --> 02:02:30,000
you shoot it like right before dark
and it runs off into the Bush camp,

5040
02:02:30,190 --> 02:02:31,100
they don't want to go after it.

5041
02:02:31,340 --> 02:02:32,390
You come back in the morning,

5042
02:02:32,420 --> 02:02:33,253
bears are eating it.

5043
02:02:33,320 --> 02:02:33,800
Yeah,

5044
02:02:33,800 --> 02:02:34,220
they eat,

5045
02:02:34,220 --> 02:02:35,120
they eat their own.

5046
02:02:35,180 --> 02:02:36,020
I've just been a guy that,

5047
02:02:36,050 --> 02:02:36,750
you know,

5048
02:02:36,750 --> 02:02:38,090
I don't have time to hunt.

5049
02:02:38,091 --> 02:02:38,300
I,

5050
02:02:38,300 --> 02:02:39,740
I've gone deer hunting a couple times.

5051
02:02:39,741 --> 02:02:40,360
I just never,

5052
02:02:40,360 --> 02:02:40,700
you know,

5053
02:02:40,700 --> 02:02:41,540
I'm more of a fish.

5054
02:02:41,600 --> 02:02:42,260
I love to fish.

5055
02:02:42,260 --> 02:02:42,800
I do too.

5056
02:02:42,800 --> 02:02:43,131
Right.

5057
02:02:43,131 --> 02:02:44,000
So that's my fishing.

5058
02:02:44,001 --> 02:02:44,720
You do.

5059
02:02:44,720 --> 02:02:45,620
I'll fish for,

5060
02:02:46,310 --> 02:02:46,581
you know,

5061
02:02:46,581 --> 02:02:48,500
I've fished for shark off a beach before.

5062
02:02:48,830 --> 02:02:50,290
That's another thing that
people get mad at it.

5063
02:02:50,291 --> 02:02:51,590
They get mad if eat sharks now.

5064
02:02:51,620 --> 02:02:52,490
Well we let them go.

5065
02:02:52,520 --> 02:02:53,241
We let them go.

5066
02:02:53,241 --> 02:02:53,511
You know,

5067
02:02:53,511 --> 02:02:53,930
that's not,

5068
02:02:53,930 --> 02:02:54,501
not a big deal.

5069
02:02:54,501 --> 02:02:56,570
But I watched a guy from black barks,

5070
02:02:56,750 --> 02:02:57,050
uh,

5071
02:02:57,050 --> 02:02:58,130
tackle company.

5072
02:02:58,430 --> 02:03:00,020
They taught me how to do it off the beach.

5073
02:03:00,050 --> 02:03:02,660
These guys are catching 14
foot hammerheads off the beach.

5074
02:03:02,661 --> 02:03:02,960
Dude.

5075
02:03:02,960 --> 02:03:06,620
Do you know one of the best places to
hunt to fish for sharks rather is off of

5076
02:03:06,621 --> 02:03:08,070
Catalina or right out,

5077
02:03:08,150 --> 02:03:08,990
right out of your wife?

5078
02:03:09,170 --> 02:03:09,501
No,

5079
02:03:09,501 --> 02:03:10,520
for a Maaco.

5080
02:03:10,640 --> 02:03:11,060
Okay.

5081
02:03:11,060 --> 02:03:12,740
It's like one of the best Maaco Shark,

5082
02:03:12,770 --> 02:03:13,603
which are massive.

5083
02:03:13,760 --> 02:03:14,361
Huge.

5084
02:03:14,361 --> 02:03:14,840
Yeah.

5085
02:03:14,840 --> 02:03:15,470
Yeah.

5086
02:03:15,470 --> 02:03:15,741
So,

5087
02:03:15,741 --> 02:03:17,000
but they taught me how to do that.

5088
02:03:17,001 --> 02:03:18,140
I love fishing for Barracuda,

5089
02:03:18,141 --> 02:03:19,250
just cause they're so aggressive.

5090
02:03:19,400 --> 02:03:20,270
It's a fun fish.

5091
02:03:20,300 --> 02:03:21,020
Oh my God.

5092
02:03:21,020 --> 02:03:22,240
They're scarier than hell.

5093
02:03:22,241 --> 02:03:23,690
As fast as they hit a lure.

5094
02:03:23,691 --> 02:03:24,250
It's crazy.

5095
02:03:24,250 --> 02:03:25,130
But crazy looking at,

5096
02:03:25,220 --> 02:03:27,490
and I love Musky Pike
fishing bass fishing.

5097
02:03:27,520 --> 02:03:29,120
Say they look like a pike on steroids.

5098
02:03:29,720 --> 02:03:30,231
That's what they are.

5099
02:03:30,231 --> 02:03:31,820
They're the sea water fish.

5100
02:03:32,150 --> 02:03:32,450
Oh yeah.

5101
02:03:32,450 --> 02:03:33,440
Muskies are awesome.

5102
02:03:33,441 --> 02:03:36,950
So I went musky fishing at the
[inaudible] Indian reservation.

5103
02:03:37,550 --> 02:03:40,460
It's the Chippewa flowage
where the biggest muskie in
the world was ever caught.

5104
02:03:40,461 --> 02:03:40,940
Right.

5105
02:03:40,940 --> 02:03:41,300
Really?

5106
02:03:41,300 --> 02:03:44,300
How much is that a 67 pounds Saturday?

5107
02:03:44,400 --> 02:03:44,780
One thing,

5108
02:03:44,780 --> 02:03:45,201
I don't know,

5109
02:03:45,201 --> 02:03:45,530
but it's,

5110
02:03:45,530 --> 02:03:46,131
it's huge.

5111
02:03:46,131 --> 02:03:46,610
It's huge.

5112
02:03:46,610 --> 02:03:47,460
Coyote size.

5113
02:03:47,690 --> 02:03:51,500
But they've found jaws and teeth of
muskies that are twice that size,

5114
02:03:51,650 --> 02:03:51,950
right.

5115
02:03:51,950 --> 02:03:53,390
Just washed up on shore type stuff.

5116
02:03:53,780 --> 02:03:55,250
So there's huge muskie still.

5117
02:03:56,030 --> 02:03:58,070
But the guy that took me fishing,

5118
02:03:58,080 --> 02:03:58,821
he took a job.

5119
02:03:58,821 --> 02:04:01,880
He used to work in Vegas for
the casino down in Vegas.

5120
02:04:01,881 --> 02:04:02,810
I forget which one.

5121
02:04:03,170 --> 02:04:05,330
And he left that and
went back to Wisconsin,

5122
02:04:05,331 --> 02:04:07,970
northern Wisconsin because
he wanted to muskie fish.

5123
02:04:08,030 --> 02:04:08,301
Right.

5124
02:04:08,301 --> 02:04:11,420
So he took a job with the Lakota Indian
reservations just so he could musky

5125
02:04:11,421 --> 02:04:13,160
fishing and he was the vice president.

5126
02:04:13,190 --> 02:04:14,660
Oh Shit.

5127
02:04:15,110 --> 02:04:16,130
Look at the size of that.

5128
02:04:16,131 --> 02:04:16,900
Fucking their tear.

5129
02:04:16,900 --> 02:04:17,660
They're terrifying.

5130
02:04:17,660 --> 02:04:18,001
Right?

5131
02:04:18,001 --> 02:04:21,110
It looks like a person that's
like a person the size to fish.

5132
02:04:21,590 --> 02:04:22,100
That's,

5133
02:04:22,100 --> 02:04:23,660
that's less than 60 pounds.

5134
02:04:23,720 --> 02:04:24,440
But those will,

5135
02:04:24,440 --> 02:04:25,460
those will attack you.

5136
02:04:25,610 --> 02:04:26,360
Oh yeah.

5137
02:04:26,360 --> 02:04:27,141
They'll attack you there.

5138
02:04:27,141 --> 02:04:30,860
That I knew a dude who invented a lure.

5139
02:04:31,660 --> 02:04:32,493
Um,

5140
02:04:32,800 --> 02:04:33,471
do I know him?

5141
02:04:33,471 --> 02:04:34,310
I know his friend.

5142
02:04:35,030 --> 02:04:35,420
I don't know.

5143
02:04:35,420 --> 02:04:35,900
Anyway,

5144
02:04:35,900 --> 02:04:38,430
someone invented a lore that was a duck.

5145
02:04:38,580 --> 02:04:39,120
Yeah,

5146
02:04:39,120 --> 02:04:41,810
it was a 15 my grandpa used
to fish Tom with ducklings.

5147
02:04:42,200 --> 02:04:44,420
You Hook them through the tail and throw
them out on top of the lake and let

5148
02:04:44,421 --> 02:04:45,710
them swim around in a Musky would hit him.

5149
02:04:45,750 --> 02:04:45,961
Yeah.

5150
02:04:45,961 --> 02:04:48,570
Isn't that crazy how the ducks,

5151
02:04:48,630 --> 02:04:49,463
yeah.

5152
02:04:49,620 --> 02:04:51,660
So this guy had a allure,

5153
02:04:51,720 --> 02:04:51,841
well,

5154
02:04:51,841 --> 02:04:53,000
you can ask on Youtube play.

5155
02:04:53,001 --> 02:04:55,920
Then as you read it in the paddles,

5156
02:04:55,990 --> 02:04:59,190
the feet would move and the Musky
would think it's a real duck.

5157
02:04:59,191 --> 02:04:59,850
And they jack.

5158
02:04:59,850 --> 02:05:00,240
Yeah.

5159
02:05:00,240 --> 02:05:01,073
So they,

5160
02:05:01,680 --> 02:05:02,760
but the guy that was the,

5161
02:05:02,820 --> 02:05:04,920
he was that casino guy
that took me fishing.

5162
02:05:04,980 --> 02:05:05,730
What do you got here?

5163
02:05:05,730 --> 02:05:08,010
Jamie called a suicide duck.

5164
02:05:08,011 --> 02:05:08,671
Lewer oh,

5165
02:05:08,671 --> 02:05:09,030
so,

5166
02:05:09,030 --> 02:05:09,361
okay,

5167
02:05:09,361 --> 02:05:10,140
so nice.

5168
02:05:10,140 --> 02:05:10,411
See,

5169
02:05:10,411 --> 02:05:13,260
this is my fishing days or
a long fucking time ago.

5170
02:05:13,290 --> 02:05:13,620
Yeah.

5171
02:05:13,620 --> 02:05:16,530
This is like when I was
a very early teenager,

5172
02:05:16,531 --> 02:05:18,720
like 1314 I was so connected to fishing.

5173
02:05:18,721 --> 02:05:19,554
I fish constantly.

5174
02:05:19,560 --> 02:05:20,393
I still fish.

5175
02:05:20,610 --> 02:05:21,443
I still love it,

5176
02:05:21,540 --> 02:05:22,141
but a,

5177
02:05:22,141 --> 02:05:24,540
I'm out of the loop in turns of like that.

5178
02:05:24,541 --> 02:05:25,560
This is a regular thing.

5179
02:05:25,561 --> 02:05:27,420
So this is a duck also.

5180
02:05:27,421 --> 02:05:28,021
The duck is like,

5181
02:05:28,021 --> 02:05:28,980
he's running away

5182
02:05:30,060 --> 02:05:30,691
at a Musky,

5183
02:05:30,691 --> 02:05:32,320
comes in Jackson and
make him look panicked,

5184
02:05:32,330 --> 02:05:32,560
right?

5185
02:05:32,560 --> 02:05:33,393
Yeah.

5186
02:05:33,750 --> 02:05:34,583
But the,

5187
02:05:34,680 --> 02:05:39,240
he was the vice president of the Musky
World Association and he took me fishing

5188
02:05:40,080 --> 02:05:40,913
and he goes there,

5189
02:05:40,950 --> 02:05:43,090
we have tons of muskies
that we've radio tag.

5190
02:05:43,110 --> 02:05:43,471
He goes,

5191
02:05:43,471 --> 02:05:44,460
but we're not going to use that.

5192
02:05:44,461 --> 02:05:45,061
That's cheating.

5193
02:05:45,061 --> 02:05:45,871
I know their patterns.

5194
02:05:45,871 --> 02:05:46,430
Anyway,

5195
02:05:46,430 --> 02:05:47,263
tag a Musky.

5196
02:05:47,370 --> 02:05:50,530
They just put punched the thing by the
Dorsal fan and it's got the little,

5197
02:05:51,300 --> 02:05:53,060
gives out a transmitter and you know,

5198
02:05:53,480 --> 02:05:55,140
you can find out their
patterns or whatever.

5199
02:05:55,860 --> 02:05:56,371
But he goes,

5200
02:05:56,371 --> 02:05:58,200
I'll take your Musky fishing
tomorrow if you want to go.

5201
02:05:58,201 --> 02:05:58,411
I said,

5202
02:05:58,411 --> 02:05:58,591
yeah,

5203
02:05:58,591 --> 02:05:58,951
awesome.

5204
02:05:58,951 --> 02:06:01,860
So we go to the bait store
and he gets chubs this big.

5205
02:06:02,070 --> 02:06:02,820
That's the bait.

5206
02:06:02,820 --> 02:06:06,080
So you're holding your hand out
about a foot and a half there,

5207
02:06:06,270 --> 02:06:08,040
at least 1214 inch fish,

5208
02:06:08,070 --> 02:06:08,281
right?

5209
02:06:08,281 --> 02:06:09,114
That's the bait.

5210
02:06:09,150 --> 02:06:09,840
Right?

5211
02:06:09,840 --> 02:06:12,090
And he'd hook 'em through
by the Dorsal Fan.

5212
02:06:12,450 --> 02:06:13,410
We'd go out in the boat,

5213
02:06:13,590 --> 02:06:16,110
drop the Chub straight down,

5214
02:06:16,140 --> 02:06:19,230
then we'd go back to the
island and he had a rod holder,

5215
02:06:19,231 --> 02:06:20,160
put the pole in there,

5216
02:06:20,161 --> 02:06:20,761
set the drag,

5217
02:06:20,761 --> 02:06:21,271
real light,

5218
02:06:21,271 --> 02:06:24,900
put a Bob at the top of the line so you
could see the bobber move if something

5219
02:06:24,901 --> 02:06:25,734
was taken off with it.

5220
02:06:26,040 --> 02:06:28,170
And we did that four separate
times with four lines.

5221
02:06:28,410 --> 02:06:32,790
And then we sat in the boat
and ate sandwiches and just
talked and then all of a

5222
02:06:32,791 --> 02:06:34,560
sudden the bobber takes off and he goes,

5223
02:06:34,561 --> 02:06:34,801
all right,

5224
02:06:34,801 --> 02:06:36,240
I'm going to pull up you
run and grab the pole.

5225
02:06:36,241 --> 02:06:37,080
Jumped back in the boat.

5226
02:06:37,680 --> 02:06:38,400
He goes,

5227
02:06:38,400 --> 02:06:39,780
I'm going to maneuver you and keep you.

5228
02:06:39,781 --> 02:06:43,080
You have to stay over the top of the
fish and with Musky trolling motor scare

5229
02:06:43,081 --> 02:06:43,740
him.

5230
02:06:43,740 --> 02:06:46,530
But a regular boat motor island
does not for some reason.

5231
02:06:46,590 --> 02:06:49,230
So I'm learning a ton of stuff
from this guy and he goes,

5232
02:06:49,260 --> 02:06:50,670
we have to for 25 minutes.

5233
02:06:50,670 --> 02:06:54,420
You have to let him turn that
fish head first and then swallow.

5234
02:06:54,510 --> 02:06:56,040
That's the rule about 25 minutes.

5235
02:06:56,041 --> 02:06:56,491
It takes them,

5236
02:06:56,491 --> 02:06:57,181
they take their time,

5237
02:06:57,181 --> 02:06:58,020
they wait till it's dead,

5238
02:06:58,021 --> 02:07:01,800
they crush it with their jaws and they
slowly flip it and then they swallow it

5239
02:07:01,890 --> 02:07:02,281
and he goes,

5240
02:07:02,281 --> 02:07:04,620
but if it starts to run
anytime before that,

5241
02:07:04,621 --> 02:07:05,760
you have to try and set the hook.

5242
02:07:05,790 --> 02:07:06,623
That's just the way it is.

5243
02:07:07,430 --> 02:07:07,831
So,

5244
02:07:07,831 --> 02:07:09,300
and this is my first time Musky fishing.

5245
02:07:09,750 --> 02:07:10,800
When they start chewing on them,

5246
02:07:10,801 --> 02:07:11,634
you just wait.

5247
02:07:11,880 --> 02:07:12,300
Yeah,

5248
02:07:12,300 --> 02:07:12,481
yeah.

5249
02:07:12,481 --> 02:07:13,231
You stay over him.

5250
02:07:13,231 --> 02:07:13,710
But so the,

5251
02:07:13,710 --> 02:07:15,870
the Musky will be swimming
a size that fucker.

5252
02:07:16,500 --> 02:07:16,800
Yeah.

5253
02:07:16,800 --> 02:07:18,030
So there'll be swimming along.

5254
02:07:18,031 --> 02:07:19,230
So somebody caught that,

5255
02:07:19,620 --> 02:07:20,760
caught that bass,

5256
02:07:20,780 --> 02:07:20,940
right.

5257
02:07:20,940 --> 02:07:22,750
Then the [inaudible] got a hold of that.

5258
02:07:22,760 --> 02:07:23,860
They just have the Musky.

5259
02:07:23,861 --> 02:07:24,694
They just have the bat.

5260
02:07:24,740 --> 02:07:24,951
Right.

5261
02:07:24,951 --> 02:07:26,510
So you've got to let them turn
them and then set the hook.

5262
02:07:26,511 --> 02:07:27,460
Then you'll catch the Musky.

5263
02:07:27,560 --> 02:07:28,100
Right.

5264
02:07:28,100 --> 02:07:29,150
But so that's what we did.

5265
02:07:29,151 --> 02:07:30,620
And at about 17 minutes it took off,

5266
02:07:30,680 --> 02:07:31,580
started to run.

5267
02:07:31,880 --> 02:07:34,640
I set the hook and I caught
a 52 inch musky first.

5268
02:07:34,780 --> 02:07:35,850
Oh

5269
02:07:35,930 --> 02:07:36,310
yeah.

5270
02:07:36,310 --> 02:07:37,300
Holy Shit.

5271
02:07:37,301 --> 02:07:38,800
I felt like I set the hook in a log.

5272
02:07:38,890 --> 02:07:40,820
That is a big fucking thing.

5273
02:07:40,821 --> 02:07:41,670
And I really cool stuff.

5274
02:07:41,680 --> 02:07:43,210
The two inch Musky man.

5275
02:07:43,540 --> 02:07:43,811
Yeah,

5276
02:07:43,811 --> 02:07:45,070
they're a northern pike.

5277
02:07:45,071 --> 02:07:45,980
Fishing is very fun.

5278
02:07:45,981 --> 02:07:47,050
I've done that in Alberta.

5279
02:07:47,170 --> 02:07:49,060
Some of my favorite times.

5280
02:07:49,061 --> 02:07:49,960
They hit hard.

5281
02:07:49,990 --> 02:07:50,141
Yeah.

5282
02:07:50,141 --> 02:07:52,360
And so the English river
system where we used to go,

5283
02:07:52,810 --> 02:07:53,643
if you catch up,

5284
02:07:54,050 --> 02:07:55,420
you know a pike this long,

5285
02:07:55,870 --> 02:07:57,670
you leave it on the hook
cause a big ones common.

5286
02:07:57,850 --> 02:07:58,410
Right.

5287
02:07:58,410 --> 02:07:59,740
And then the first time it happened to me,

5288
02:08:00,010 --> 02:08:01,120
scared the living shit out of it.

5289
02:08:01,300 --> 02:08:05,500
So when you catch a pike that's two feet
long and you just leave it on the hook,

5290
02:08:05,530 --> 02:08:07,090
let it swim around up there anyway.

5291
02:08:07,180 --> 02:08:09,030
And you're just hoping that no you're not.

5292
02:08:09,340 --> 02:08:10,173
It's common.

5293
02:08:10,390 --> 02:08:10,960
It's common.

5294
02:08:10,960 --> 02:08:12,100
Wow.

5295
02:08:12,610 --> 02:08:13,150
Yeah.

5296
02:08:13,150 --> 02:08:13,840
So a big one.

5297
02:08:13,840 --> 02:08:14,673
This one here.

5298
02:08:15,280 --> 02:08:15,510
Yeah.

5299
02:08:15,510 --> 02:08:16,343
Watch

5300
02:08:17,380 --> 02:08:18,670
fucking cannibals.

5301
02:08:19,450 --> 02:08:22,120
Cannibals in the Goldwater
world number babe.

5302
02:08:22,121 --> 02:08:23,870
Winkelman the professional
fishermen shore.

5303
02:08:24,470 --> 02:08:29,470
This one is right there it comes and
he's just holding it over this bigger one

5304
02:08:29,741 --> 02:08:30,580
that's underneath it.

5305
02:08:30,790 --> 02:08:32,590
There's such a crazy animal too,

5306
02:08:32,770 --> 02:08:36,820
like pike seen prehistoric and
they are cannibals without a doubt.

5307
02:08:36,850 --> 02:08:37,480
Yeah,

5308
02:08:37,480 --> 02:08:38,313
Babe Winkelman.

5309
02:08:38,320 --> 02:08:40,600
I watched the video while
I was in Canada fishing.

5310
02:08:40,990 --> 02:08:44,890
We were at the lodge and Babe Winkelman
is asking this guy who's a an Indian

5311
02:08:44,891 --> 02:08:45,370
guide.

5312
02:08:45,370 --> 02:08:46,180
He goes,

5313
02:08:46,180 --> 02:08:47,050
so what do pike?

5314
02:08:47,350 --> 02:08:48,310
And the guide goes,

5315
02:08:48,910 --> 02:08:50,440
pike the Pike.

5316
02:08:50,470 --> 02:08:50,890
And he goes,

5317
02:08:50,890 --> 02:08:51,101
no,

5318
02:08:51,101 --> 02:08:51,850
what to Pikey?

5319
02:08:51,850 --> 02:08:52,121
He goes,

5320
02:08:52,121 --> 02:08:53,890
Pike like they breed.

5321
02:08:53,891 --> 02:08:54,724
So they have food.

5322
02:08:55,030 --> 02:08:56,110
That's what they eat.

5323
02:08:57,440 --> 02:08:58,900
It's just they're just aggressive.

5324
02:08:58,901 --> 02:08:59,830
Mean Fish.

5325
02:09:00,100 --> 02:09:00,311
Yeah.

5326
02:09:00,311 --> 02:09:03,760
And they live in that dog eat dog cold
water environment where there's three

5327
02:09:03,761 --> 02:09:05,440
feet of ice above them half the time.

5328
02:09:05,470 --> 02:09:05,890
Right,

5329
02:09:05,890 --> 02:09:06,101
right.

5330
02:09:06,101 --> 02:09:06,490
Yeah.

5331
02:09:06,490 --> 02:09:08,230
Well all those animals up there like,

5332
02:09:08,350 --> 02:09:08,651
look,

5333
02:09:08,651 --> 02:09:09,670
we're talking about bears.

5334
02:09:09,670 --> 02:09:11,860
Have bears being cannibals and hike,

5335
02:09:11,870 --> 02:09:13,630
being cannibals and the fucking deer,

5336
02:09:13,631 --> 02:09:14,850
350 pounds.

5337
02:09:14,910 --> 02:09:16,780
It's just a tough hardcore world.

5338
02:09:16,920 --> 02:09:17,440
Yeah.

5339
02:09:17,440 --> 02:09:19,090
I mean when it gets that God damn cold,

5340
02:09:19,600 --> 02:09:21,160
it's a tough world.

5341
02:09:21,520 --> 02:09:24,790
Then you go to a whole nother level and
go to places like Africa and Australia

5342
02:09:24,880 --> 02:09:25,540
and it's hot.

5343
02:09:25,540 --> 02:09:27,220
It's another world too.

5344
02:09:27,330 --> 02:09:29,140
Everything's deadly in Australia.

5345
02:09:29,141 --> 02:09:30,130
I wouldn't even want to live there.

5346
02:09:30,160 --> 02:09:30,790
That's right.

5347
02:09:30,790 --> 02:09:31,660
Adam Green Tree.

5348
02:09:31,720 --> 02:09:32,780
Listen to Pat Miletich,

5349
02:09:33,010 --> 02:09:36,560
my friend Adam who shot that a
water buffalo head in Australia,

5350
02:09:36,670 --> 02:09:38,800
keeps trying to get me to go down
there and hunt with me with him.

5351
02:09:38,801 --> 02:09:39,310
And he's,

5352
02:09:39,310 --> 02:09:42,340
every time he sends me
pictures of spiders kill you,

5353
02:09:42,341 --> 02:09:44,080
a lizard that can kill your own snakes.

5354
02:09:44,900 --> 02:09:45,070
Yeah.

5355
02:09:45,070 --> 02:09:45,491
Everything.

5356
02:09:45,491 --> 02:09:50,290
Everything kills centipedes and they
have these gigantic 2000 pound buffaloes

5357
02:09:50,291 --> 02:09:53,980
that are super hyper aggressive and
they're roaming around smash you.

5358
02:09:54,130 --> 02:09:54,371
They will,

5359
02:09:54,371 --> 02:09:55,330
they have to kill them though.

5360
02:09:55,360 --> 02:09:56,051
That's another thing.

5361
02:09:56,051 --> 02:09:57,310
It's like the grizzly bear thing.

5362
02:09:57,311 --> 02:09:58,510
They don't have predators,

5363
02:09:59,090 --> 02:09:59,530
you know,

5364
02:09:59,530 --> 02:09:59,831
in,

5365
02:09:59,831 --> 02:10:01,150
in Alaska,

5366
02:10:01,200 --> 02:10:02,140
but they're herbivores.

5367
02:10:02,141 --> 02:10:04,330
So they're kind of meant
to be handed in my mind.

5368
02:10:04,580 --> 02:10:05,390
Yes,

5369
02:10:05,390 --> 02:10:05,950
I agree.

5370
02:10:05,950 --> 02:10:07,510
But there's nothing to
hunt them out there.

5371
02:10:07,550 --> 02:10:07,730
Right.

5372
02:10:07,730 --> 02:10:10,900
The problem with Australia is
that these are invasive species.

5373
02:10:11,040 --> 02:10:12,580
I got pretty much everything over there.

5374
02:10:12,581 --> 02:10:15,160
So the ranchers brought them there or
something for someone brought them there a

5375
02:10:15,161 --> 02:10:16,270
long time ago.

5376
02:10:16,330 --> 02:10:19,180
New Zealand's the craziest place
because New Zealand is essentially,

5377
02:10:19,270 --> 02:10:19,690
uh,

5378
02:10:19,690 --> 02:10:19,990
they,

5379
02:10:19,990 --> 02:10:22,880
they set it up as a wild
game park for rich a year,

5380
02:10:22,960 --> 02:10:25,060
Europeans long time ago.

5381
02:10:25,210 --> 02:10:29,260
And so now they have these enormous stags
and all these huge animals that live

5382
02:10:29,261 --> 02:10:29,650
there,

5383
02:10:29,650 --> 02:10:31,420
but no predators.

5384
02:10:31,630 --> 02:10:33,500
So sometimes they have to thin the herd,

5385
02:10:33,501 --> 02:10:34,040
they have to fly

5386
02:10:34,040 --> 02:10:35,930
over with helicopters and gun him down.

5387
02:10:36,170 --> 02:10:36,291
Well,

5388
02:10:36,291 --> 02:10:37,124
they hunt.

5389
02:10:37,280 --> 02:10:37,670
I mean,

5390
02:10:37,670 --> 02:10:38,570
we're allowed,

5391
02:10:38,630 --> 02:10:40,190
they made a rule in Bettendorf,

5392
02:10:40,191 --> 02:10:41,600
Iowa within city limits.

5393
02:10:41,601 --> 02:10:43,460
You can hunt deer with a bow.

5394
02:10:43,700 --> 02:10:44,330
Yeah.

5395
02:10:44,330 --> 02:10:46,040
Within city limits because
there's just so many of them.

5396
02:10:46,070 --> 02:10:47,480
You'll see a herd of 50 of them.

5397
02:10:47,750 --> 02:10:48,950
They do that in Pennsylvania too.

5398
02:10:48,980 --> 02:10:49,340
Okay.

5399
02:10:49,340 --> 02:10:49,581
Yeah.

5400
02:10:49,581 --> 02:10:52,610
There's a lot of places where they just
get so overrun that they have what they

5401
02:10:52,611 --> 02:10:53,540
call urban hunting.

5402
02:10:53,570 --> 02:10:54,080
Yeah.

5403
02:10:54,080 --> 02:10:54,651
But people set up,

5404
02:10:54,651 --> 02:10:56,660
tree stands in their
backyard and you know,

5405
02:10:56,680 --> 02:10:56,930
uh,

5406
02:10:56,930 --> 02:10:57,950
as far as the fishing goes,

5407
02:10:57,951 --> 02:10:58,784
you should go noodling,

5408
02:10:59,510 --> 02:11:00,650
noodling for catfish.

5409
02:11:00,900 --> 02:11:03,080
You got to bite your hand talk that,

5410
02:11:03,620 --> 02:11:06,830
that seems so stupid because occasionally
you fuck up and get a snapping turtle.

5411
02:11:06,831 --> 02:11:07,040
Right.

5412
02:11:07,040 --> 02:11:07,873
Or beaver.

5413
02:11:09,580 --> 02:11:10,413
Beaver.

5414
02:11:11,330 --> 02:11:13,190
And that's a beaver that
can shoot down a tree.

5415
02:11:13,191 --> 02:11:14,240
Magic what it do to your wrists.

5416
02:11:14,280 --> 02:11:15,113
It would hurt.

5417
02:11:15,320 --> 02:11:16,010
Definitely.

5418
02:11:16,010 --> 02:11:17,270
I did at one time and that was,

5419
02:11:17,570 --> 02:11:18,980
it went noodling one time.

5420
02:11:18,990 --> 02:11:19,820
I actually got lucky.

5421
02:11:19,820 --> 02:11:20,031
Yeah,

5422
02:11:20,031 --> 02:11:20,261
I got it.

5423
02:11:20,261 --> 02:11:20,480
Yeah.

5424
02:11:20,480 --> 02:11:21,710
It was like 14 pounder,

5425
02:11:22,350 --> 02:11:23,150
you know?

5426
02:11:23,150 --> 02:11:24,620
But when they snapped on your arm,

5427
02:11:24,621 --> 02:11:25,520
it scares the shit out of you.

5428
02:11:25,550 --> 02:11:25,701
Oh,

5429
02:11:25,701 --> 02:11:26,690
I'm sure right now,

5430
02:11:26,691 --> 02:11:29,900
what is the idea is that the catfish
thinks you're intruding or they think it's

5431
02:11:29,901 --> 02:11:30,410
a fish.

5432
02:11:30,410 --> 02:11:31,820
All they do think it's our hands,

5433
02:11:31,840 --> 02:11:32,110
a fish,

5434
02:11:32,110 --> 02:11:33,600
and they get to see your hand is bait.

5435
02:11:33,670 --> 02:11:34,070
Well,

5436
02:11:34,070 --> 02:11:34,903
fuck that.

5437
02:11:34,910 --> 02:11:36,770
I like fishing poles.

5438
02:11:36,771 --> 02:11:38,930
I like to be in a boat or on the shore.

5439
02:11:38,980 --> 02:11:39,411
I like all the,

5440
02:11:39,411 --> 02:11:41,570
all the sophisticated intelligent things.

5441
02:11:41,571 --> 02:11:41,910
Yeah.

5442
02:11:41,910 --> 02:11:42,743
Yeah.

5443
02:11:43,830 --> 02:11:44,750
So I was going to ask you,

5444
02:11:44,751 --> 02:11:45,110
how's it,

5445
02:11:45,110 --> 02:11:46,880
how's it been working with Jimmy Smith?

5446
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:47,840
I love that guy.

5447
02:11:48,650 --> 02:11:49,483
He's brilliant.

5448
02:11:49,670 --> 02:11:50,311
He's a very smart,

5449
02:11:50,311 --> 02:11:51,860
trying to get him hired
about four years ago.

5450
02:11:52,350 --> 02:11:54,080
And it was because the
UFC was looking for God,

5451
02:11:54,110 --> 02:11:54,471
first of all,

5452
02:11:54,471 --> 02:11:57,210
trying to do last commentary because I
was traveling too much and I was trying

5453
02:11:57,211 --> 02:11:57,911
to do last time I was like,

5454
02:11:57,911 --> 02:11:58,760
you got to hire this guy.

5455
02:11:58,760 --> 02:11:59,593
He's the best.

5456
02:11:59,750 --> 02:12:00,411
He's really,

5457
02:12:00,411 --> 02:12:01,131
really smart.

5458
02:12:01,131 --> 02:12:04,160
I love first we're doing our
first show together in April,

5459
02:12:04,520 --> 02:12:06,470
the Tony Ferguson Habib number of Madoff.

5460
02:12:06,650 --> 02:12:06,801
Oh,

5461
02:12:06,801 --> 02:12:07,100
good,

5462
02:12:07,100 --> 02:12:07,311
good.

5463
02:12:07,311 --> 02:12:07,491
Yeah,

5464
02:12:07,491 --> 02:12:07,851
it could be.

5465
02:12:07,851 --> 02:12:09,080
Versus Tony's going to be,

5466
02:12:09,081 --> 02:12:10,610
it's a perfect fight for,

5467
02:12:10,760 --> 02:12:11,370
you know,

5468
02:12:11,370 --> 02:12:14,140
whose color and play by play then is
he doing play by play and you're doing

5469
02:12:14,250 --> 02:12:14,600
color?

5470
02:12:14,600 --> 02:12:14,870
No,

5471
02:12:14,870 --> 02:12:17,630
John Annex doing play by play and Johnson.

5472
02:12:17,631 --> 02:12:19,080
Awesome guys both doing color.

5473
02:12:19,400 --> 02:12:20,300
We're just going to have fun.

5474
02:12:20,301 --> 02:12:21,050
He's our friend,

5475
02:12:21,050 --> 02:12:21,291
you know,

5476
02:12:21,291 --> 02:12:22,910
and he's been on the
podcast a bunch of times.

5477
02:12:22,911 --> 02:12:23,370
Right Buddy?

5478
02:12:23,370 --> 02:12:24,203
So it'll be,

5479
02:12:24,500 --> 02:12:25,370
it'll be a good time.

5480
02:12:25,690 --> 02:12:30,260
He cut his teeth doing a TV
show about combat sports.

5481
02:12:30,500 --> 02:12:30,980
More about,

5482
02:12:30,980 --> 02:12:33,590
he did [inaudible] around
the world or whatever.

5483
02:12:33,591 --> 02:12:34,520
Learning different arts.

5484
02:12:34,550 --> 02:12:35,840
Was it called fight support?

5485
02:12:36,050 --> 02:12:36,771
What was it called?

5486
02:12:36,771 --> 02:12:37,311
Something like that.

5487
02:12:37,311 --> 02:12:38,390
Fight quest fight.

5488
02:12:39,350 --> 02:12:40,183
It was,

5489
02:12:40,190 --> 02:12:40,640
yeah,

5490
02:12:40,640 --> 02:12:41,510
he did that.

5491
02:12:41,540 --> 02:12:43,280
But I mean I think he's,

5492
02:12:43,520 --> 02:12:47,870
but he also had MMA fights and
he's a legit black belt in Jujitsu.

5493
02:12:48,110 --> 02:12:48,680
He's no,

5494
02:12:48,680 --> 02:12:49,370
he knows this stuff.

5495
02:12:49,370 --> 02:12:51,560
Super Smart and well read guy too.

5496
02:12:51,650 --> 02:12:52,100
Yeah,

5497
02:12:52,100 --> 02:12:52,260
I'm,

5498
02:12:52,260 --> 02:12:52,851
I'm excited.

5499
02:12:52,851 --> 02:12:54,020
I'm excited that he's on board.

5500
02:12:54,021 --> 02:12:54,530
Yeah.

5501
02:12:54,530 --> 02:12:55,640
I always liked listening to him.

5502
02:12:55,760 --> 02:12:55,911
Yeah.

5503
02:12:55,911 --> 02:12:57,020
Bella tour fucked up.

5504
02:12:57,200 --> 02:12:58,160
They fucked up and they left.

5505
02:12:58,190 --> 02:12:58,580
I couldn't,

5506
02:12:58,580 --> 02:12:59,600
I was wondering what,

5507
02:12:59,840 --> 02:13:00,720
so what,

5508
02:13:00,730 --> 02:13:01,060
what?

5509
02:13:01,060 --> 02:13:01,970
I'm not to Pry,

5510
02:13:01,971 --> 02:13:05,240
but my guess was he just asked for more
money probably because he has an offer

5511
02:13:05,241 --> 02:13:06,050
from the UFC,

5512
02:13:06,050 --> 02:13:06,890
they wouldn't match it.

5513
02:13:06,891 --> 02:13:07,670
So he took,

5514
02:13:07,670 --> 02:13:08,001
well,

5515
02:13:08,001 --> 02:13:08,420
whatever,

5516
02:13:08,420 --> 02:13:12,350
they didn't want him leaving for the UFC
four years ago when I tried to get him

5517
02:13:12,351 --> 02:13:12,741
hired.

5518
02:13:12,741 --> 02:13:13,010
Right.

5519
02:13:13,010 --> 02:13:13,940
And um,

5520
02:13:14,060 --> 02:13:17,810
there was like a big hullabaloo
and they wound up keeping them.

5521
02:13:18,050 --> 02:13:22,040
And then I think his contract was up
and I think the way he described it was

5522
02:13:22,041 --> 02:13:23,660
they actually wanted
to give him less money.

5523
02:13:24,090 --> 02:13:24,740
He was getting,

5524
02:13:24,740 --> 02:13:28,490
and I think they're just
experiencing some severe budget cuts.

5525
02:13:28,730 --> 02:13:30,890
If you think about Bella tours market,

5526
02:13:31,170 --> 02:13:31,980
like what they're trying

5527
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:32,730
to do,

5528
02:13:32,730 --> 02:13:34,560
they don't have a paper view business.

5529
02:13:34,590 --> 02:13:34,751
Right.

5530
02:13:34,751 --> 02:13:35,160
You know,

5531
02:13:35,160 --> 02:13:36,720
and if you don't have a
paper review business,

5532
02:13:36,721 --> 02:13:38,730
where's the bulk of all
your money coming from?

5533
02:13:38,731 --> 02:13:40,320
It's like kind of bleeding Viacom.

5534
02:13:40,350 --> 02:13:40,860
Right.

5535
02:13:40,860 --> 02:13:41,340
I just thought,

5536
02:13:41,340 --> 02:13:42,030
I just thought,

5537
02:13:42,030 --> 02:13:42,301
you know,

5538
02:13:42,301 --> 02:13:43,134
when it happened,

5539
02:13:44,040 --> 02:13:44,431
I said,

5540
02:13:44,431 --> 02:13:47,910
why didn't they change the name when
coker was brought in to takeover?

5541
02:13:47,930 --> 02:13:48,120
Yeah.

5542
02:13:48,120 --> 02:13:50,970
It made zero sense to me
because Bella tour had that,

5543
02:13:51,960 --> 02:13:52,231
you know,

5544
02:13:52,231 --> 02:13:53,220
from Bjorn Rep knee.

5545
02:13:53,221 --> 02:13:57,510
I've never been to Bjorn revenue fan
Bjorn revenue from that boxing promoter

5546
02:13:57,511 --> 02:13:58,080
type,

5547
02:13:58,080 --> 02:13:58,491
you know,

5548
02:13:58,491 --> 02:13:59,324
whatever it was.

5549
02:13:59,730 --> 02:14:01,800
And everybody that I talked to in that,

5550
02:14:02,310 --> 02:14:03,210
in that business,

5551
02:14:03,330 --> 02:14:05,820
they were all terrified and
intimidated and everything else.

5552
02:14:06,010 --> 02:14:06,541
A lot of shit.

5553
02:14:06,541 --> 02:14:06,841
Yeah,

5554
02:14:06,841 --> 02:14:07,381
it was just a lot.

5555
02:14:07,381 --> 02:14:08,071
I never met the guy.

5556
02:14:08,071 --> 02:14:10,530
I don't know anything about him other
than the bad things that I've heard from

5557
02:14:10,531 --> 02:14:10,850
fighters.

5558
02:14:10,850 --> 02:14:11,131
Right.

5559
02:14:11,131 --> 02:14:12,180
And so you know,

5560
02:14:12,300 --> 02:14:13,710
King Mo calling him a Dick Rider,

5561
02:14:14,960 --> 02:14:17,670
kick low king king,

5562
02:14:17,910 --> 02:14:19,920
King Mo and I go back and forth on,

5563
02:14:19,990 --> 02:14:20,581
on the Internet,

5564
02:14:20,581 --> 02:14:21,414
on Facebook and stuff.

5565
02:14:21,840 --> 02:14:25,190
I'll deliberately piss him off on
po political stuff and just get him,

5566
02:14:25,960 --> 02:14:26,790
get him,

5567
02:14:26,790 --> 02:14:29,640
get him Sunday or appreciated
talent when it comes to fighting.

5568
02:14:29,900 --> 02:14:30,141
No,

5569
02:14:30,141 --> 02:14:30,420
he's a,

5570
02:14:30,420 --> 02:14:33,030
he that guy was a monster.

5571
02:14:33,031 --> 02:14:34,140
Physical problems though.

5572
02:14:34,141 --> 02:14:35,520
Like with the Mercer,

5573
02:14:35,550 --> 02:14:37,700
he had some serious staph infection.

5574
02:14:37,770 --> 02:14:38,000
Right.

5575
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,140
Some real bad ones that wrecked him.

5576
02:14:40,680 --> 02:14:41,730
That fucking shit scared.

5577
02:14:41,731 --> 02:14:42,361
He's a great guy though.

5578
02:14:42,361 --> 02:14:42,870
We talk,

5579
02:14:42,870 --> 02:14:44,880
we talk now and then when
I see a good stuff he has,

5580
02:14:44,881 --> 02:14:45,714
he's cool dude.

5581
02:14:45,950 --> 02:14:46,783
And uh,

5582
02:14:46,890 --> 02:14:47,490
but uh,

5583
02:14:47,490 --> 02:14:47,731
God,

5584
02:14:47,731 --> 02:14:49,290
where were we when we were talking about,

5585
02:14:49,291 --> 02:14:51,990
but we should have changed the name.

5586
02:14:52,410 --> 02:14:55,920
It's just synonymous with tournaments
and the guy loses a title and suddenly

5587
02:14:55,921 --> 02:14:57,030
he's thrown back into a tournament.

5588
02:14:57,030 --> 02:14:58,020
He's already made his name.

5589
02:14:58,320 --> 02:15:00,300
It's just a shitty business model.

5590
02:15:00,720 --> 02:15:03,510
And Bella Torah was for
the Spanish speaking crowd,

5591
02:15:03,511 --> 02:15:03,990
right?

5592
02:15:03,990 --> 02:15:07,170
Isn't that what they were trying to
get out of that whole thing word right?

5593
02:15:07,220 --> 02:15:10,140
I think it's or Roman word
for gladiator or some shit.

5594
02:15:10,141 --> 02:15:10,471
But yeah,

5595
02:15:10,471 --> 02:15:12,030
it started out as,

5596
02:15:12,031 --> 02:15:12,864
um,

5597
02:15:13,030 --> 02:15:15,870
wasn't on like ESPN Deportes
or something like that,

5598
02:15:16,480 --> 02:15:18,540
but it just didn't make
sense with coke taken over.

5599
02:15:18,541 --> 02:15:22,150
And I don't want to watch
the Geritol posy fight.

5600
02:15:23,070 --> 02:15:24,600
I don't want to see a pap military flight.

5601
02:15:24,660 --> 02:15:25,191
I don't mind.

5602
02:15:25,191 --> 02:15:26,024
I want to see Ya.

5603
02:15:26,080 --> 02:15:26,913
Right.

5604
02:15:26,940 --> 02:15:27,600
Everybody's,

5605
02:15:27,600 --> 02:15:28,260
you know,

5606
02:15:28,260 --> 02:15:29,460
I love some of those guys,

5607
02:15:29,910 --> 02:15:30,900
but I don't want to watch it.

5608
02:15:30,930 --> 02:15:31,351
I agree.

5609
02:15:31,351 --> 02:15:31,770
It's,

5610
02:15:31,770 --> 02:15:32,220
you know,

5611
02:15:32,220 --> 02:15:33,270
it's a young man's sport.

5612
02:15:33,271 --> 02:15:34,680
It's guys that are animals,

5613
02:15:34,681 --> 02:15:35,461
fast movers,

5614
02:15:35,461 --> 02:15:36,570
just yeast,

5615
02:15:36,900 --> 02:15:41,900
invincible human beings in their mid
twenties to thirties early thirties I guy

5616
02:15:42,271 --> 02:15:43,650
that's 45 years old.

5617
02:15:43,651 --> 02:15:43,980
I just,

5618
02:15:43,980 --> 02:15:44,290
just,

5619
02:15:44,290 --> 02:15:47,610
just 45 but 45 years old
with MMA miles on them.

5620
02:15:47,630 --> 02:15:48,030
Yeah.

5621
02:15:48,030 --> 02:15:48,990
That's the real issue,

5622
02:15:49,110 --> 02:15:49,380
right?

5623
02:15:49,380 --> 02:15:50,250
It's that these guys,

5624
02:15:50,251 --> 02:15:54,000
their bodies have been beaten up for
so many decades in the gym and all the

5625
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:55,930
years of wrestling and
kickboxing and yeah,

5626
02:15:56,310 --> 02:15:57,480
they're just not the same.

5627
02:15:57,510 --> 02:15:58,280
No.

5628
02:15:58,280 --> 02:15:58,680
Yeah.

5629
02:15:58,680 --> 02:15:59,490
It takes its toll.

5630
02:15:59,490 --> 02:16:01,290
It definitely takes its
toll and you're just not,

5631
02:16:02,010 --> 02:16:02,761
you're just not the same.

5632
02:16:02,761 --> 02:16:02,941
I mean,

5633
02:16:02,941 --> 02:16:04,970
there's part of me that respects
the shit out of a guy like hoists.

5634
02:16:04,971 --> 02:16:06,660
Gracie is still a fucking savage.

5635
02:16:06,661 --> 02:16:09,390
If 50 years of age ready
to throw down with anybody,

5636
02:16:09,391 --> 02:16:10,380
he wouldn't fight me.

5637
02:16:10,620 --> 02:16:11,453
He wouldn't sign up.

5638
02:16:11,550 --> 02:16:12,383
When was this?

5639
02:16:12,630 --> 02:16:13,380
I've been trying to,

5640
02:16:13,380 --> 02:16:13,920
I,

5641
02:16:13,920 --> 02:16:14,580
I,

5642
02:16:14,580 --> 02:16:15,530
I mean with Bella tour,

5643
02:16:15,540 --> 02:16:16,111
I said pricking,

5644
02:16:16,111 --> 02:16:17,330
get Gracie to fight me.

5645
02:16:17,640 --> 02:16:18,960
When he was fighting Shamrock,

5646
02:16:19,160 --> 02:16:21,000
I confronted shamrock on access.

5647
02:16:21,060 --> 02:16:23,560
That was one of the worst
fights that I had passed.

5648
02:16:23,600 --> 02:16:25,710
When Matt beat the Shit out of him,

5649
02:16:25,960 --> 02:16:27,150
Matt took his back,

5650
02:16:27,330 --> 02:16:29,320
was smashed him and I was like,

5651
02:16:29,321 --> 02:16:30,370
Jesus Christ.

5652
02:16:30,370 --> 02:16:30,641
I was like,

5653
02:16:30,641 --> 02:16:31,360
this is,

5654
02:16:31,360 --> 02:16:33,400
this is so mismatched.

5655
02:16:33,720 --> 02:16:36,010
So the voices in a
different era and Matt is,

5656
02:16:36,130 --> 02:16:37,540
even though Matt's not ranked,

5657
02:16:37,541 --> 02:16:39,190
he's a legit blackbelt right,

5658
02:16:39,250 --> 02:16:39,640
right.

5659
02:16:39,640 --> 02:16:42,940
And a stud wrestler and a physical freak,

5660
02:16:43,030 --> 02:16:48,030
an end super experienced with modern
high level MMA hoists was living in the

5661
02:16:49,241 --> 02:16:50,074
past.

5662
02:16:50,230 --> 02:16:51,190
And the thing was with that,

5663
02:16:51,191 --> 02:16:54,220
that was after rob Lawler
worry mark on myself,

5664
02:16:54,221 --> 02:16:54,911
Tim Silvia,

5665
02:16:54,911 --> 02:16:55,541
Gann Mcgee,

5666
02:16:55,541 --> 02:16:56,231
Chuck Lidell,

5667
02:16:56,231 --> 02:16:58,240
all of us were on that
movie set in Mexico,

5668
02:16:58,900 --> 02:16:59,890
that Paul Walker film.

5669
02:17:00,070 --> 02:17:00,550
Okay.

5670
02:17:00,550 --> 02:17:01,210
Right.

5671
02:17:01,210 --> 02:17:01,940
Paul was great guy.

5672
02:17:01,940 --> 02:17:02,320
He's,

5673
02:17:02,320 --> 02:17:04,330
he was legitimately a good human being.

5674
02:17:04,331 --> 02:17:05,530
I'm sure you knew him and all that.

5675
02:17:05,531 --> 02:17:06,161
She doesn't know him,

5676
02:17:06,161 --> 02:17:06,994
but I heard the stuff,

5677
02:17:07,480 --> 02:17:10,780
the stuff that he did on the set to stick
up for the small guys was incredible.

5678
02:17:11,110 --> 02:17:12,400
Maybe we got time to talk about it,

5679
02:17:12,401 --> 02:17:13,030
but not,

5680
02:17:13,030 --> 02:17:13,481
we're not.

5681
02:17:13,481 --> 02:17:14,290
But,

5682
02:17:14,290 --> 02:17:15,123
um,

5683
02:17:15,460 --> 02:17:16,590
we had gotten done with that.

5684
02:17:16,610 --> 02:17:19,060
We'd become friends with
Paul Walker and Oakley Lemon,

5685
02:17:19,061 --> 02:17:21,400
who was his stunt double for everything.

5686
02:17:21,401 --> 02:17:21,920
And,

5687
02:17:21,920 --> 02:17:22,450
um,

5688
02:17:22,450 --> 02:17:24,310
the stunt guys were all
really cool with us.

5689
02:17:24,550 --> 02:17:27,280
We kind of gravitate towards them
because there's stunt guys when we're

5690
02:17:27,281 --> 02:17:27,671
fighters.

5691
02:17:27,671 --> 02:17:28,750
We got along really well with them,

5692
02:17:29,560 --> 02:17:31,150
but Laurence Fishburne was on the set,

5693
02:17:31,151 --> 02:17:32,080
the Keratin brothers,

5694
02:17:32,081 --> 02:17:32,610
you know,

5695
02:17:32,610 --> 02:17:34,000
I'm a kid from Iowa going,

5696
02:17:34,001 --> 02:17:34,960
this is fucking awesome,

5697
02:17:35,070 --> 02:17:35,230
right?

5698
02:17:35,230 --> 02:17:35,501
These are,

5699
02:17:35,501 --> 02:17:36,334
these are cool too.

5700
02:17:36,350 --> 02:17:36,760
Sorry,

5701
02:17:36,760 --> 02:17:37,780
just to be around these guys.

5702
02:17:37,781 --> 02:17:38,950
But um,

5703
02:17:39,220 --> 02:17:44,220
so they were all at that fight in La and
Paul Walker and all his actor buddies

5704
02:17:44,321 --> 02:17:45,011
were in one row,

5705
02:17:45,011 --> 02:17:48,010
right behind them was Oakley
lemon and all his stunt guys.

5706
02:17:48,310 --> 02:17:52,570
And so Paul Walker was a
Gracie Jujitsu student.

5707
02:17:52,600 --> 02:17:54,340
He loved that.

5708
02:17:54,580 --> 02:17:56,950
And so they were cheering for voice.

5709
02:17:56,980 --> 02:17:58,360
All the stunt guys were
treating from that.

5710
02:17:59,020 --> 02:17:59,890
They're the hardcore,

5711
02:17:59,891 --> 02:18:00,250
like,

5712
02:18:00,250 --> 02:18:00,850
you know.

5713
02:18:00,850 --> 02:18:01,683
So anyway,

5714
02:18:02,230 --> 02:18:05,350
Matt just dismantles
it rex and completely,

5715
02:18:05,700 --> 02:18:07,180
and I turn around,

5716
02:18:07,181 --> 02:18:10,930
I'm up on the deck outside the cage and
I turned around and Paul Walker and all

5717
02:18:10,931 --> 02:18:13,330
this actor buddies are
like the US like Holy Shit.

5718
02:18:13,330 --> 02:18:13,750
Like,

5719
02:18:13,750 --> 02:18:16,900
I can't believe this just
happened standing on the chairs.

5720
02:18:16,901 --> 02:18:19,150
Behind them is Oakley Lemon and all the,

5721
02:18:19,210 --> 02:18:20,280
all the stunt guys going,

5722
02:18:20,530 --> 02:18:21,050
yeah,

5723
02:18:21,050 --> 02:18:21,883
military.

5724
02:18:22,030 --> 02:18:22,930
That's awesome.

5725
02:18:23,230 --> 02:18:23,920
It was.

5726
02:18:23,920 --> 02:18:24,430
It was,

5727
02:18:24,430 --> 02:18:27,790
but I saw half that crowd crying.

5728
02:18:27,840 --> 02:18:28,330
Yeah.

5729
02:18:28,330 --> 02:18:30,070
Cause they saw a god get destroyed.

5730
02:18:30,280 --> 02:18:34,780
But I mean this is a hero to
hoist is like for martial arts.

5731
02:18:34,810 --> 02:18:35,590
He,

5732
02:18:35,590 --> 02:18:37,090
he was a legitimate hero.

5733
02:18:37,120 --> 02:18:40,240
He was the first guy to win the
ultimate fighting championship.

5734
02:18:40,270 --> 02:18:42,490
And the way he did it was like,

5735
02:18:42,491 --> 02:18:42,671
Whoa,

5736
02:18:42,671 --> 02:18:43,121
look at this.

5737
02:18:43,121 --> 02:18:45,570
These guys using technique that
we didn't even know exists.

5738
02:18:45,571 --> 02:18:46,750
Little skinny guy.

5739
02:18:46,751 --> 02:18:47,710
There's just mainly people.

5740
02:18:47,711 --> 02:18:50,020
And the thing was with all of that,

5741
02:18:50,110 --> 02:18:50,943
you know,

5742
02:18:51,550 --> 02:18:54,910
then the Gracies came back with Hughes
was just a better athlete and used all

5743
02:18:54,911 --> 02:18:55,480
Jujitsu,

5744
02:18:55,480 --> 02:18:57,880
Gracie Jujitsu to beat Gracie Jiu Jitsu.

5745
02:18:58,270 --> 02:18:59,620
So I went through all the stuff.

5746
02:18:59,621 --> 02:19:02,030
He hit a duck under on hoist when
hoists tried to hit him with an elbow.

5747
02:19:02,030 --> 02:19:02,271
The road,

5748
02:19:02,271 --> 02:19:05,170
it's like hitting with a half Nelson
when hoy started regained guard,

5749
02:19:05,171 --> 02:19:06,040
when Matt took his back,

5750
02:19:06,041 --> 02:19:07,810
that was just a bunch of
wrestling mixed in there.

5751
02:19:07,930 --> 02:19:08,710
Right.

5752
02:19:08,710 --> 02:19:11,440
And so then they brought out Alomeda.

5753
02:19:11,470 --> 02:19:11,651
Now,

5754
02:19:11,651 --> 02:19:13,690
Meda was their dog to come and beat Matt.

5755
02:19:13,880 --> 02:19:14,260
Right?

5756
02:19:14,260 --> 02:19:17,110
So they put in Alomeda
who was bigger than that?

5757
02:19:17,260 --> 02:19:17,501
You know,

5758
02:19:17,501 --> 02:19:18,970
he's a big dude for that weight division.

5759
02:19:19,720 --> 02:19:19,961
Well,

5760
02:19:19,961 --> 02:19:22,390
Matt deliberately hit him with a
wrestling front headlock and choke him

5761
02:19:22,391 --> 02:19:22,990
unconscious.

5762
02:19:22,990 --> 02:19:23,231
Well,

5763
02:19:23,231 --> 02:19:26,410
it was a position that a lot of Jujitsu
guys are used to being in there and they

5764
02:19:26,411 --> 02:19:27,250
just relaxed.

5765
02:19:27,350 --> 02:19:28,190
They're waiting for you to spin

5766
02:19:28,190 --> 02:19:29,023
to the back,

5767
02:19:29,090 --> 02:19:30,800
but instead of spinning
to the back matches,

5768
02:19:30,801 --> 02:19:31,970
crank that sucker down.

5769
02:19:31,971 --> 02:19:33,370
When you shut off your stuff,

5770
02:19:33,380 --> 02:19:37,080
the head under the armpit and you
crank that down and then twist it,

5771
02:19:37,170 --> 02:19:37,650
crushed it.

5772
02:19:37,650 --> 02:19:38,151
You just get,

5773
02:19:38,151 --> 02:19:38,751
you get choked.

5774
02:19:38,751 --> 02:19:40,640
That's all there is actually
a gorilla like Matt.

5775
02:19:40,670 --> 02:19:41,030
Right.

5776
02:19:41,030 --> 02:19:42,230
And so when they did the interview,

5777
02:19:42,231 --> 02:19:44,150
you were probably the guy doing
the interview and he goes,

5778
02:19:44,540 --> 02:19:44,901
he goes,

5779
02:19:44,901 --> 02:19:45,141
you know,

5780
02:19:45,141 --> 02:19:49,160
it was just nice to use wrestling on
a Jujitsu and to cut him unconscious.

5781
02:19:49,400 --> 02:19:50,060
Not just yet.

5782
02:19:50,060 --> 02:19:52,400
I don't think Ricardo knew
that that could put them out.

5783
02:19:52,430 --> 02:19:52,940
Right.

5784
02:19:52,940 --> 02:19:53,250
You know,

5785
02:19:53,250 --> 02:19:55,820
I mean a lot of us have been
in those positions before,

5786
02:19:55,821 --> 02:19:59,510
but it's usually a transitionary position
where a guy turns and gets you back on

5787
02:19:59,520 --> 02:20:00,890
like no one's ever done it since either,

5788
02:20:00,920 --> 02:20:01,390
by the way.

5789
02:20:01,390 --> 02:20:01,730
No,

5790
02:20:01,730 --> 02:20:03,440
no one's ever talked to
the guy on the wrestling.

5791
02:20:03,440 --> 02:20:04,191
Guys in wrestling,

5792
02:20:04,191 --> 02:20:05,180
we'll use that stuff.

5793
02:20:05,560 --> 02:20:08,030
You know like Dave little
bitch who wrestled for Purdue,

5794
02:20:08,031 --> 02:20:08,870
Dave and Julie A.

5795
02:20:08,870 --> 02:20:09,011
Little bit,

5796
02:20:09,011 --> 02:20:09,111
Jay,

5797
02:20:09,111 --> 02:20:13,370
we're all Americans at Purdue and they
were beasts and obviously little bitch.

5798
02:20:13,371 --> 02:20:15,860
They were Croatian psycho
correlations in Michigan City,

5799
02:20:15,861 --> 02:20:20,060
Indiana where they grew up and little
bitch used to use a move that they named

5800
02:20:20,061 --> 02:20:22,880
the little bitch where it was a,

5801
02:20:23,900 --> 02:20:25,640
you'd include what the
fuck is the name of it,

5802
02:20:25,641 --> 02:20:26,211
not a Doris,

5803
02:20:26,211 --> 02:20:27,290
but Anaconda.

5804
02:20:27,450 --> 02:20:28,010
Anaconda.

5805
02:20:28,010 --> 02:20:31,370
It was an anaconda in college wrestling
and it looked like you had a front

5806
02:20:31,371 --> 02:20:33,980
headlock and he would
choke people unconscious.

5807
02:20:33,981 --> 02:20:34,880
As soon as they'd go lip,

5808
02:20:34,881 --> 02:20:35,810
he'd grab the chin,

5809
02:20:35,840 --> 02:20:36,730
roll him and pin him.

5810
02:20:37,090 --> 02:20:37,650
Ah,

5811
02:20:37,650 --> 02:20:42,320
he was doing that with Turner about that
Dave Little Bitch pin bill Tate from

5812
02:20:42,321 --> 02:20:42,831
Iowa state.

5813
02:20:42,831 --> 02:20:43,760
Bill Tate was a Waterloo,

5814
02:20:43,761 --> 02:20:45,240
Iowa guy and he put them asleep.

5815
02:20:45,310 --> 02:20:46,760
He put them asleep and pinned him in the,

5816
02:20:46,761 --> 02:20:48,140
in the NCAA championships.

5817
02:20:48,140 --> 02:20:48,973
Is that illegal?

5818
02:20:49,220 --> 02:20:49,341
Oh,

5819
02:20:49,341 --> 02:20:50,151
it's totally illegal.

5820
02:20:50,151 --> 02:20:52,760
But referees didn't understand it
because it looked like you had the arm

5821
02:20:52,761 --> 02:20:53,720
included in the headlock.

5822
02:20:53,721 --> 02:20:53,900
Right,

5823
02:20:53,900 --> 02:20:54,350
right.

5824
02:20:54,350 --> 02:20:56,660
But if you do have an arm
included in a headlock,

5825
02:20:56,850 --> 02:20:58,580
well is it your fault
if the guy goes asleep?

5826
02:20:58,581 --> 02:20:59,030
No,

5827
02:20:59,030 --> 02:20:59,600
none at all.

5828
02:20:59,600 --> 02:21:01,070
But see what it is when he go to pin him,

5829
02:21:01,100 --> 02:21:02,840
if the referee recognized he went limp,

5830
02:21:02,841 --> 02:21:05,880
they would stop the match
for a potentially dangerous
hold or whatever she'd

5831
02:21:05,900 --> 02:21:10,090
have to do is get some of these really
bad UFC referees to referee wrestling and

5832
02:21:10,130 --> 02:21:11,570
they would have no idea
who that guy was that.

5833
02:21:11,571 --> 02:21:11,780
Yeah.

5834
02:21:11,780 --> 02:21:12,110
Yeah.

5835
02:21:12,110 --> 02:21:14,660
But there's guys doing
the juicy at the NCAAS,

5836
02:21:14,661 --> 02:21:16,700
the guy hitting the key lock on
the guy trying to break his arm.

5837
02:21:16,760 --> 02:21:17,600
No.

5838
02:21:17,930 --> 02:21:18,380
Yeah,

5839
02:21:18,380 --> 02:21:21,170
didn't I'm Mark Schultz
do that in the Olympics.

5840
02:21:21,800 --> 02:21:22,071
All,

5841
02:21:22,071 --> 02:21:22,311
you know,

5842
02:21:22,311 --> 02:21:24,470
I'm not sure if the guy's
fucking arm off with that.

5843
02:21:24,630 --> 02:21:24,900
Uh,

5844
02:21:24,900 --> 02:21:26,510
I believe he's disqualified.

5845
02:21:26,530 --> 02:21:30,650
I mean the Schultz brothers were just
scaring and Dave Schultz was unbeatable

5846
02:21:30,710 --> 02:21:31,400
animals.

5847
02:21:31,400 --> 02:21:33,560
They were trying to build people
to beat him over in Russia.

5848
02:21:33,590 --> 02:21:34,010
When Ma,

5849
02:21:34,010 --> 02:21:35,240
remember when mark fought,

5850
02:21:35,330 --> 02:21:36,800
he fought big daddy Goodrich,

5851
02:21:37,300 --> 02:21:38,330
truly Marette rag doll.

5852
02:21:38,780 --> 02:21:40,910
But then in the movie they had,

5853
02:21:40,970 --> 02:21:42,590
they used a different guy.

5854
02:21:42,740 --> 02:21:45,290
They didn't have him fight in
big daddy Goodrich in the movie.

5855
02:21:45,291 --> 02:21:46,580
They had him fight some Russian.

5856
02:21:46,600 --> 02:21:47,930
It was at Fox catcher or something.

5857
02:21:47,931 --> 02:21:49,130
It was a bullshit scene.

5858
02:21:49,131 --> 02:21:49,461
I was like,

5859
02:21:49,461 --> 02:21:50,570
why would you do that?

5860
02:21:50,571 --> 02:21:52,130
This is actual real history.

5861
02:21:52,520 --> 02:21:56,180
You really have a guy who's like one of
the best wrestlers to ever fight in MMA.

5862
02:21:56,181 --> 02:21:56,990
To us,

5863
02:21:56,990 --> 02:22:00,020
it was a real historical moment and
he took it on last second notice.

5864
02:22:00,080 --> 02:22:01,360
He fought big daddy Goodrich.

5865
02:22:01,400 --> 02:22:02,330
We all remember it.

5866
02:22:02,540 --> 02:22:03,920
But in this fucking movie,

5867
02:22:04,160 --> 02:22:05,000
you faked it.

5868
02:22:05,060 --> 02:22:06,110
You put someone else in.

5869
02:22:06,170 --> 02:22:07,520
So what else did you fake?

5870
02:22:07,850 --> 02:22:12,380
The bullshit was in this movie we are
pretending this is a historical recreation

5871
02:22:12,620 --> 02:22:15,390
of a real national crime
that everybody heard about.

5872
02:22:15,391 --> 02:22:19,340
It was a real tragedy and it was a tragedy
against a guy who was one of the best

5873
02:22:19,341 --> 02:22:21,780
wrestlers that America had to offer for.

5874
02:22:22,100 --> 02:22:22,881
I felt,

5875
02:22:22,881 --> 02:22:26,070
I felt like it was one
of the worst examples

5876
02:22:26,070 --> 02:22:27,480
of what Hollywood does.

5877
02:22:27,481 --> 02:22:29,970
The arrogance of Hollywood
due to a real story,

5878
02:22:30,030 --> 02:22:30,863
a real story.

5879
02:22:30,990 --> 02:22:32,280
They just decided,

5880
02:22:32,310 --> 02:22:33,330
fuck big daddy,

5881
02:22:33,331 --> 02:22:33,721
good rich.

5882
02:22:33,721 --> 02:22:38,640
Why have him in there and would be like
Mike Tyson pretending Mike Tyson won the

5883
02:22:38,641 --> 02:22:41,160
fucking world title against
Ivan Drago or something.

5884
02:22:41,190 --> 02:22:41,461
Really,

5885
02:22:41,461 --> 02:22:45,540
it would be something everybody
knows what the real fight was.

5886
02:22:45,830 --> 02:22:46,663
You know,

5887
02:22:48,150 --> 02:22:49,230
being an Iowa Guy,

5888
02:22:49,290 --> 02:22:52,800
this whole California experience and
Hollywood and all this stuff freaks me the

5889
02:22:52,801 --> 02:22:53,220
fuck out.

5890
02:22:53,220 --> 02:22:53,670
It should.

5891
02:22:53,670 --> 02:22:55,640
It does was just some I,

5892
02:22:55,641 --> 02:22:58,350
I was out here pitching TV shows
before the ultimate fighter.

5893
02:22:59,160 --> 02:23:04,160
I was pitching on ultimate ultimate
fighter show to Kevin Riley,

5894
02:23:04,500 --> 02:23:06,360
who was the president of NBC at the time,

5895
02:23:06,900 --> 02:23:08,220
and John Hirschfeld,

5896
02:23:08,221 --> 02:23:09,054
who you know,

5897
02:23:09,240 --> 02:23:09,511
right?

5898
02:23:09,511 --> 02:23:10,440
John Hirschfield goes,

5899
02:23:10,441 --> 02:23:10,621
look,

5900
02:23:10,621 --> 02:23:11,431
you're going to have maybe five,

5901
02:23:11,431 --> 02:23:12,420
10 minutes with these people,

5902
02:23:12,600 --> 02:23:13,433
right.

5903
02:23:13,740 --> 02:23:16,710
I had them laughing for an hour
and a half and they're like,

5904
02:23:16,711 --> 02:23:17,544
this is awesome.

5905
02:23:17,640 --> 02:23:18,540
I love this show.

5906
02:23:18,540 --> 02:23:21,720
I love this idea and mine was much
different than the ultimate fighter.

5907
02:23:21,750 --> 02:23:22,320
Right.

5908
02:23:22,320 --> 02:23:23,250
It actually made sense.

5909
02:23:23,251 --> 02:23:26,880
The four pillars of MMA and competing
in each one and all that sort of stuff.

5910
02:23:26,881 --> 02:23:27,714
Right.

5911
02:23:28,650 --> 02:23:28,980
Well,

5912
02:23:28,980 --> 02:23:30,990
he called us personally and he goes,

5913
02:23:31,440 --> 02:23:32,040
you know,

5914
02:23:32,040 --> 02:23:33,960
the board talked about
it and the board just,

5915
02:23:33,961 --> 02:23:34,530
he goes,

5916
02:23:34,530 --> 02:23:35,363
I couldn't get it through.

5917
02:23:35,620 --> 02:23:39,150
They just don't feel mainstreams ready
for this type of thing and all that.

5918
02:23:39,151 --> 02:23:41,790
Then the ultimate fighter came out
on spike and the rest was history,

5919
02:23:41,791 --> 02:23:45,060
but every time I had
one show sold to stars,

5920
02:23:45,660 --> 02:23:47,460
the guy that used to be
the president of the Hbo,

5921
02:23:47,461 --> 02:23:48,294
I remember him.

5922
02:23:48,510 --> 02:23:49,230
Which guy?

5923
02:23:49,230 --> 02:23:50,490
The guy that got in trouble,

5924
02:23:50,840 --> 02:23:51,051
right?

5925
02:23:51,051 --> 02:23:51,240
Yeah.

5926
02:23:51,240 --> 02:23:52,440
I can't remember his name now off.

5927
02:23:52,460 --> 02:23:56,820
I remember Brett Rhett know
rex now I can all Breck.

5928
02:23:56,910 --> 02:23:57,660
Yeah,

5929
02:23:57,660 --> 02:23:58,231
Chris Albrecht.

5930
02:23:58,231 --> 02:23:58,920
Chris Albright.

5931
02:23:58,920 --> 02:23:59,753
That's it.

5932
02:24:00,030 --> 02:24:04,440
I had a show sold and then they were
going to co brand it with Spartacus and

5933
02:24:04,441 --> 02:24:07,890
then the lead actor from Spartacus got
terminal cancer and they couldn't cope

5934
02:24:07,891 --> 02:24:09,600
random together and that deal fell apart.

5935
02:24:09,630 --> 02:24:13,590
Then another one that I had sold fell
apart because of the collapse in 2008 and

5936
02:24:13,591 --> 02:24:13,981
I was like,

5937
02:24:13,981 --> 02:24:14,161
dude,

5938
02:24:14,161 --> 02:24:15,750
I can't win anything.

5939
02:24:15,780 --> 02:24:17,790
Like deal set business.

5940
02:24:17,791 --> 02:24:20,880
Also like if you're an outsider and
you're coming in here to try to pitch

5941
02:24:20,881 --> 02:24:21,121
things,

5942
02:24:21,121 --> 02:24:23,310
there's so many people they already
know that they're pitching things,

5943
02:24:23,311 --> 02:24:23,760
right?

5944
02:24:23,760 --> 02:24:26,640
Like you got to imagine if you're a
guy that's a producer or you know,

5945
02:24:26,641 --> 02:24:27,300
uh,

5946
02:24:27,300 --> 02:24:27,511
uh,

5947
02:24:27,511 --> 02:24:29,370
an executive rather at
some sort of a network,

5948
02:24:29,640 --> 02:24:32,150
you've got people knocking
on your door all day long.

5949
02:24:32,151 --> 02:24:35,490
You're used to quality from certain
people or when you want to see you've seen

5950
02:24:35,491 --> 02:24:36,360
their work before.

5951
02:24:37,770 --> 02:24:39,810
It's very hard for an outsider to get in.

5952
02:24:39,840 --> 02:24:40,171
Oh Dude,

5953
02:24:40,171 --> 02:24:41,004
I finally just went,

5954
02:24:41,390 --> 02:24:41,730
yeah,

5955
02:24:41,730 --> 02:24:44,010
I had so many concepts
written on a laptop.

5956
02:24:44,011 --> 02:24:46,800
I'd sit up all hours of the
night writing concepts for shows,

5957
02:24:46,801 --> 02:24:47,634
all that sort of stuff.

5958
02:24:48,990 --> 02:24:50,400
This thing that you're doing for fun,

5959
02:24:50,850 --> 02:24:52,440
you're a conspiracy farm.

5960
02:24:52,440 --> 02:24:57,440
That's probably your best way in podcasts
are the best way in because the build

5961
02:24:57,721 --> 02:25:01,440
an audience and undeniable
audience and we want to go to,

5962
02:25:01,470 --> 02:25:01,950
you know,

5963
02:25:01,950 --> 02:25:02,671
black sites,

5964
02:25:02,671 --> 02:25:03,061
CIA,

5965
02:25:03,061 --> 02:25:03,721
black sites,

5966
02:25:03,721 --> 02:25:04,120
and,

5967
02:25:04,120 --> 02:25:07,500
and arrest us and drag our ass in there.

5968
02:25:07,620 --> 02:25:07,921
Right?

5969
02:25:07,921 --> 02:25:09,030
We want to get in trouble,

5970
02:25:09,120 --> 02:25:09,361
right?

5971
02:25:09,361 --> 02:25:12,060
And we want to go to places
where we don't want that.

5972
02:25:12,090 --> 02:25:13,560
We're going to push say you'd want that.

5973
02:25:13,561 --> 02:25:14,340
You don't want that?

5974
02:25:14,340 --> 02:25:15,060
I don't.

5975
02:25:15,060 --> 02:25:15,361
Okay.

5976
02:25:15,361 --> 02:25:16,111
I get what you're saying.

5977
02:25:16,111 --> 02:25:17,700
But we want to push the envelope,

5978
02:25:17,790 --> 02:25:18,031
right?

5979
02:25:18,031 --> 02:25:19,470
We want to push the
envelope when we want to.

5980
02:25:19,770 --> 02:25:24,070
We want to expose the real facts behind
what's really going on and that would

5981
02:25:24,070 --> 02:25:24,851
cause some heat.

5982
02:25:24,851 --> 02:25:26,560
I'm sure that we eventually get a call.

5983
02:25:27,120 --> 02:25:31,870
You know where you need to kind of
divert off the path you're on without a

5984
02:25:31,871 --> 02:25:32,200
doubt.

5985
02:25:32,200 --> 02:25:33,190
You look at forward to that call.

5986
02:25:33,200 --> 02:25:34,710
Are you starting to do a show like that?

5987
02:25:34,750 --> 02:25:35,980
I did Joe Rogan questions,

5988
02:25:35,981 --> 02:25:36,431
everything,

5989
02:25:36,431 --> 02:25:41,170
but mostly it was on
big foot and Ufo stuff.

5990
02:25:41,171 --> 02:25:43,130
You're not going to get
in trouble from aliens,

5991
02:25:43,190 --> 02:25:43,630
right?

5992
02:25:43,630 --> 02:25:44,380
Well,

5993
02:25:44,380 --> 02:25:47,230
it was mostly almost all bullshit.

5994
02:25:47,290 --> 02:25:48,160
That's the problem.

5995
02:25:48,161 --> 02:25:51,670
And I was much more interested
in conspiracy theories
before I did that show,

5996
02:25:51,880 --> 02:25:55,030
but in the six months that I did that
show and all these different people that I

5997
02:25:55,031 --> 02:25:56,620
interviewed and all the
stuff you saw in the air,

5998
02:25:56,621 --> 02:26:01,621
it was just a fraction of the total mass
of all the people that I talk to mostly

5999
02:26:01,880 --> 02:26:02,680
was bullshit.

6000
02:26:02,680 --> 02:26:04,000
Mostly is crazy people.

6001
02:26:04,120 --> 02:26:09,120
Most of these people that just have
a bad way of looking at reality,

6002
02:26:09,960 --> 02:26:10,830
like they're there.

6003
02:26:11,300 --> 02:26:14,710
They have confirmation bias and
the way they look at things,

6004
02:26:14,711 --> 02:26:18,010
they just have this very distorted
version of what the truth is.

6005
02:26:18,190 --> 02:26:20,470
And they also want big foot to be real.

6006
02:26:20,471 --> 02:26:21,880
They want aliens to be real.

6007
02:26:21,881 --> 02:26:25,150
They want the government to be spraying
shit out of planes above us all the

6008
02:26:25,151 --> 02:26:25,984
time.

6009
02:26:26,050 --> 02:26:26,771
It's all just,

6010
02:26:26,771 --> 02:26:27,604
but we've had,

6011
02:26:27,750 --> 02:26:30,910
we've had Brennan who was head
of the CIA admit to that though,

6012
02:26:30,911 --> 02:26:31,360
at least.

6013
02:26:31,360 --> 02:26:31,541
Well,

6014
02:26:31,541 --> 02:26:36,541
they admit to one thing that they
have looked into weather modification,

6015
02:26:37,600 --> 02:26:42,600
but the idea that every fucking south
west flight is spraying aluminum and all

6016
02:26:42,641 --> 02:26:43,780
this different shit in the air.

6017
02:26:43,810 --> 02:26:44,380
No,

6018
02:26:44,380 --> 02:26:44,981
for sure.

6019
02:26:44,981 --> 02:26:48,250
They've experimented on
using it for warfare.

6020
02:26:48,320 --> 02:26:48,581
I mean,

6021
02:26:48,581 --> 02:26:49,750
they've looked into everything.

6022
02:26:49,751 --> 02:26:50,850
They've looked at [inaudible] house,

6023
02:26:50,851 --> 02:26:52,090
fear over your enemy,

6024
02:26:52,690 --> 02:26:53,201
your enemy,

6025
02:26:53,201 --> 02:26:54,400
and have storms breakout on them.

6026
02:26:54,460 --> 02:26:55,091
There's that.

6027
02:26:55,091 --> 02:26:56,320
And also to,

6028
02:26:56,321 --> 02:26:56,730
uh,

6029
02:26:56,730 --> 02:26:57,070
look,

6030
02:26:57,070 --> 02:26:57,371
you know,

6031
02:26:57,371 --> 02:26:58,151
in Abu Dhabi,

6032
02:26:58,151 --> 02:26:59,410
they make it rain every week.

6033
02:27:00,040 --> 02:27:01,750
They make it rain fell two times a year.

6034
02:27:01,751 --> 02:27:02,320
Yeah,

6035
02:27:02,320 --> 02:27:02,950
just do it with,

6036
02:27:02,950 --> 02:27:05,050
they just throw money in the
air and it fucking rains.

6037
02:27:05,270 --> 02:27:09,460
Like they just figured out a way to cloud
seed and that cloud seeding has been

6038
02:27:09,461 --> 02:27:10,090
around forever.

6039
02:27:10,090 --> 02:27:10,710
That's real.

6040
02:27:10,710 --> 02:27:11,080
Yeah.

6041
02:27:11,080 --> 02:27:14,050
But that's not what you're seeing when
you see planes fly overhead and you see

6042
02:27:14,051 --> 02:27:15,970
those clouds that form behind the planes,

6043
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:18,130
that is a reaction
between the jet engines,

6044
02:27:18,250 --> 02:27:19,720
the condensation in the atmosphere,

6045
02:27:19,721 --> 02:27:20,680
the heat of the jet engine.

6046
02:27:20,710 --> 02:27:22,930
And that was never sold
on it for a long time.

6047
02:27:22,931 --> 02:27:24,370
I was never sold on that at all.

6048
02:27:24,400 --> 02:27:25,233
It's ridiculous.

6049
02:27:25,240 --> 02:27:25,450
You know,

6050
02:27:25,450 --> 02:27:26,140
I was never,

6051
02:27:26,140 --> 02:27:26,561
you know,

6052
02:27:26,561 --> 02:27:27,160
and the,

6053
02:27:27,160 --> 02:27:29,200
the nine 11 conspiracies
and stuff like that.

6054
02:27:29,201 --> 02:27:33,190
The only thing that I've noticed about
that is you can see the detonations going

6055
02:27:33,191 --> 02:27:34,860
off on building seven when it never got,

6056
02:27:34,870 --> 02:27:39,460
you don't see detonations when you see
soft floors collapsing and the pressure

6057
02:27:39,490 --> 02:27:40,840
of these floors collapsing,

6058
02:27:40,841 --> 02:27:42,550
causing these windows to blow out,

6059
02:27:42,570 --> 02:27:43,030
right.

6060
02:27:43,030 --> 02:27:45,730
This is just what would happen if
something was paying scribe to it,

6061
02:27:45,731 --> 02:27:46,540
is what I'm saying.

6062
02:27:46,540 --> 02:27:47,373
I don't know what you're saying.

6063
02:27:47,590 --> 02:27:48,880
I don't subscribe to it either.

6064
02:27:48,940 --> 02:27:49,773
I mean,

6065
02:27:50,080 --> 02:27:55,030
who knows what the fuck happened
with all the shit behind the scenes.

6066
02:27:55,150 --> 02:27:57,670
But what we do know is that a
bunch of people capitalize on that,

6067
02:27:57,671 --> 02:27:58,980
which makes it look like conspiracy.

6068
02:27:58,990 --> 02:28:02,270
All the intelligence reports that came
out before that happened was that the

6069
02:28:02,350 --> 02:28:05,660
terrorist planned on using planes
as missiles to take down building.

6070
02:28:05,950 --> 02:28:08,350
We knew that at least
that's where I stopped.

6071
02:28:08,680 --> 02:28:11,710
I lean much more towards
incompetence than I do.

6072
02:28:11,740 --> 02:28:12,830
Massive conspiracy.

6073
02:28:12,831 --> 02:28:13,664
A bunch of Barney fife,

6074
02:28:13,720 --> 02:28:14,553
keystone cops.

6075
02:28:15,190 --> 02:28:16,023
That's what I think.

6076
02:28:16,390 --> 02:28:17,260
But who knows.

6077
02:28:17,610 --> 02:28:17,910
Um,

6078
02:28:17,910 --> 02:28:20,110
I wanted to talk to you about marathons,

6079
02:28:20,230 --> 02:28:21,380
about ultra marathons.

6080
02:28:21,381 --> 02:28:21,831
Like you,

6081
02:28:21,831 --> 02:28:22,010
you

6082
02:28:22,010 --> 02:28:22,830
got into,

6083
02:28:22,830 --> 02:28:22,870
uh,

6084
02:28:22,870 --> 02:28:24,320
when did you start getting into this?

6085
02:28:25,100 --> 02:28:26,360
It was a couple of years ago,

6086
02:28:26,750 --> 02:28:27,680
John Byrne,

6087
02:28:27,681 --> 02:28:32,360
who is a professor at a college in my
hometown and he and his family had taken

6088
02:28:32,361 --> 02:28:35,570
martial arts from me for years
and he one day walked up to me,

6089
02:28:35,571 --> 02:28:39,410
I think it was 2012 or earlier,

6090
02:28:40,010 --> 02:28:40,611
and he goes,

6091
02:28:40,611 --> 02:28:40,851
hey,

6092
02:28:40,851 --> 02:28:41,061
he goes,

6093
02:28:41,061 --> 02:28:42,890
I want to thank you for all
the confidence you've given me.

6094
02:28:43,310 --> 02:28:44,420
And he was an amazing guy,

6095
02:28:44,600 --> 02:28:45,141
very,

6096
02:28:45,141 --> 02:28:47,510
very smart guy and a great athlete,

6097
02:28:48,260 --> 02:28:49,250
great basketball player.

6098
02:28:49,251 --> 02:28:51,320
The guys now 53 years old,

6099
02:28:51,321 --> 02:28:52,154
I think,

6100
02:28:52,310 --> 02:28:53,270
and never gets hurt.

6101
02:28:53,330 --> 02:28:56,030
He can do anything he wants
and he does not get hurt.

6102
02:28:56,031 --> 02:28:57,620
He's just a genetic freak,

6103
02:28:57,621 --> 02:28:58,400
right?

6104
02:28:58,400 --> 02:28:59,270
But he comes to me and he goes,

6105
02:28:59,271 --> 02:29:00,440
thank you for giving me the confidence.

6106
02:29:00,441 --> 02:29:01,520
I love the martial arts training,

6107
02:29:01,521 --> 02:29:02,570
but I'm going to try something new.

6108
02:29:02,571 --> 02:29:02,871
And I said,

6109
02:29:02,871 --> 02:29:03,380
what are you going to try?

6110
02:29:03,380 --> 02:29:03,651
And he goes,

6111
02:29:03,651 --> 02:29:05,000
this thing called the Leadville 100.

6112
02:29:05,660 --> 02:29:06,493
And I go,

6113
02:29:06,740 --> 02:29:07,640
what the hell is that?

6114
02:29:08,180 --> 02:29:08,451
He goes,

6115
02:29:08,451 --> 02:29:08,661
well,

6116
02:29:08,661 --> 02:29:09,530
it's a high altitude,

6117
02:29:09,531 --> 02:29:11,360
a hundred mile race through
the Colorado Rockies.

6118
02:29:11,361 --> 02:29:11,661
And I go,

6119
02:29:11,661 --> 02:29:13,100
how many days is this supposed to take?

6120
02:29:13,101 --> 02:29:13,371
And he goes,

6121
02:29:13,371 --> 02:29:13,641
oh no,

6122
02:29:13,641 --> 02:29:14,780
you do it all at once.

6123
02:29:16,100 --> 02:29:19,080
You're going to do a hundred
miles without basically stopped.

6124
02:29:19,081 --> 02:29:19,371
And he goes,

6125
02:29:19,371 --> 02:29:19,551
yeah,

6126
02:29:19,551 --> 02:29:20,540
he goes about every 10 miles,

6127
02:29:20,541 --> 02:29:22,640
you get new food and fluids
and you just keep going.

6128
02:29:23,550 --> 02:29:23,870
I went,

6129
02:29:23,870 --> 02:29:24,320
awesome.

6130
02:29:24,320 --> 02:29:24,831
Go do it,

6131
02:29:24,831 --> 02:29:25,250
man.

6132
02:29:25,250 --> 02:29:26,240
And he went and he finished.

6133
02:29:26,390 --> 02:29:27,920
He barely barely made the cutoff,

6134
02:29:27,921 --> 02:29:29,000
which is 30 hours.

6135
02:29:29,090 --> 02:29:30,110
You have to do it right.

6136
02:29:30,560 --> 02:29:31,760
And so I thought,

6137
02:29:31,790 --> 02:29:33,200
this is really cool.

6138
02:29:33,390 --> 02:29:36,350
And it was a couple of years ago where
he sent me a message and he goes,

6139
02:29:36,351 --> 02:29:37,490
I'm training for Leadville again.

6140
02:29:38,210 --> 02:29:39,043
I go,

6141
02:29:39,380 --> 02:29:41,270
maybe it's a good idea for me to jump in.

6142
02:29:41,630 --> 02:29:43,310
I want to do something extreme.

6143
02:29:44,750 --> 02:29:46,280
And since I quit fighting,

6144
02:29:46,310 --> 02:29:48,890
I couldn't ever find that was
just that void in my life,

6145
02:29:48,891 --> 02:29:49,430
right.

6146
02:29:49,430 --> 02:29:50,930
And my health was deteriorating.

6147
02:29:50,931 --> 02:29:52,790
I couldn't figure out how to
get back in shape because,

6148
02:29:53,420 --> 02:29:53,870
um,

6149
02:29:53,870 --> 02:29:55,130
I was in pain constantly.

6150
02:29:55,131 --> 02:29:55,821
I had asthma,

6151
02:29:55,821 --> 02:29:56,571
all this other stuff.

6152
02:29:56,571 --> 02:29:57,860
I found out that that was gluten,

6153
02:29:58,050 --> 02:29:59,000
the gluten problem.

6154
02:29:59,540 --> 02:29:59,900
Right.

6155
02:29:59,900 --> 02:30:01,460
And I thought before that I thought,

6156
02:30:01,461 --> 02:30:04,520
if somebody says I'm gluten sensitive
or I have allergy to gluten,

6157
02:30:04,521 --> 02:30:04,701
I go,

6158
02:30:04,701 --> 02:30:05,490
whatever.

6159
02:30:05,490 --> 02:30:06,323
What is gluten?

6160
02:30:06,440 --> 02:30:07,273
Right?

6161
02:30:07,520 --> 02:30:09,590
But I was running into so
many physical problems.

6162
02:30:09,591 --> 02:30:12,020
I started training with these
guys and I'd be crippled for two,

6163
02:30:12,021 --> 02:30:12,531
three days.

6164
02:30:12,531 --> 02:30:14,450
I'd be in so much pain that
I couldn't do anything.

6165
02:30:14,930 --> 02:30:17,360
And then my buddy goes and
I was getting ready to eat,

6166
02:30:17,510 --> 02:30:18,840
start eating oxy cottons.

6167
02:30:19,070 --> 02:30:19,461
That was,

6168
02:30:19,461 --> 02:30:19,731
I mean,

6169
02:30:19,731 --> 02:30:21,020
I could survive on Motrin,

6170
02:30:21,080 --> 02:30:21,913
all the pain,

6171
02:30:22,250 --> 02:30:22,911
everything else.

6172
02:30:22,911 --> 02:30:24,800
But I got to the point where I flying.

6173
02:30:25,160 --> 02:30:28,700
I'd walked five gates in the airport
and have to stop and sit down.

6174
02:30:28,701 --> 02:30:29,540
I was in so much pain.

6175
02:30:29,570 --> 02:30:30,860
My arthritis was just horrible.

6176
02:30:30,861 --> 02:30:31,970
I'd be soaked in sweat,

6177
02:30:32,390 --> 02:30:32,901
everything else.

6178
02:30:32,901 --> 02:30:35,570
So I had all these problems and I
figured if I train with these guys,

6179
02:30:35,571 --> 02:30:36,590
it'll bring me out of this,

6180
02:30:37,130 --> 02:30:38,840
this point in life,

6181
02:30:39,260 --> 02:30:40,340
and it will change my life.

6182
02:30:40,341 --> 02:30:41,151
And I'll get back to the,

6183
02:30:41,151 --> 02:30:41,451
you know,

6184
02:30:41,451 --> 02:30:44,480
pat mental chip of the old
while I was falling apart.

6185
02:30:44,481 --> 02:30:46,460
Worse because of the
intensity of the training.

6186
02:30:47,210 --> 02:30:48,650
So my buddy did blood tests on me.

6187
02:30:48,651 --> 02:30:49,484
He goes,

6188
02:30:49,760 --> 02:30:51,320
you're going to be dead in
three years from a heart attack.

6189
02:30:51,321 --> 02:30:52,610
There's so much inflammation in your body.

6190
02:30:52,611 --> 02:30:53,990
If you don't stop eating gluten,

6191
02:30:54,020 --> 02:30:54,231
I go,

6192
02:30:54,231 --> 02:30:55,100
what the Hell is gluten?

6193
02:30:55,101 --> 02:30:55,311
He goes,

6194
02:30:55,311 --> 02:30:55,911
wheat and soy.

6195
02:30:55,911 --> 02:30:57,470
You have to stop eating where you're dead.

6196
02:30:57,490 --> 02:30:58,980
He swings gluten.

6197
02:30:59,290 --> 02:31:00,123
Yeah,

6198
02:31:00,320 --> 02:31:01,100
wheat and soy.

6199
02:31:01,100 --> 02:31:02,300
So it's all about how,

6200
02:31:02,301 --> 02:31:02,750
wait a minute,

6201
02:31:02,750 --> 02:31:04,670
I thought it's all modified grains.

6202
02:31:04,920 --> 02:31:05,500
Soy.

6203
02:31:05,500 --> 02:31:06,530
Soy has been modified,

6204
02:31:06,531 --> 02:31:09,560
like black beans have been modified
for a certain amount of time.

6205
02:31:09,561 --> 02:31:10,770
Your body doesn't digest black.

6206
02:31:10,910 --> 02:31:12,860
Black beans really like
a waste of time to eat.

6207
02:31:13,280 --> 02:31:13,701
So,

6208
02:31:13,701 --> 02:31:14,271
but the,

6209
02:31:14,271 --> 02:31:17,210
the wheat and the soy is what was
causing the inflammation along with the

6210
02:31:17,211 --> 02:31:19,770
spraying that goes on
with wheat and soy fields.

6211
02:31:19,771 --> 02:31:20,550
It's really bad,

6212
02:31:20,550 --> 02:31:20,761
right?

6213
02:31:20,761 --> 02:31:21,450
Yeah.

6214
02:31:21,450 --> 02:31:22,283
So anyway.

6215
02:31:22,810 --> 02:31:23,500
Yeah,

6216
02:31:23,500 --> 02:31:24,091
it's bad.

6217
02:31:24,091 --> 02:31:24,541
Bad stuff.

6218
02:31:24,541 --> 02:31:25,374
So anyway,

6219
02:31:25,590 --> 02:31:27,240
he said you'll be dead in three
years from a heart attack.

6220
02:31:27,241 --> 02:31:28,350
There's so much inflammation.

6221
02:31:28,830 --> 02:31:29,581
You have asthma,

6222
02:31:29,581 --> 02:31:30,900
you have three forms of arthritis,

6223
02:31:30,901 --> 02:31:32,070
your digestion system,

6224
02:31:32,080 --> 02:31:33,810
your digestive system is destroyed.

6225
02:31:33,811 --> 02:31:33,991
He goes,

6226
02:31:33,991 --> 02:31:34,950
how's your temper been lately?

6227
02:31:34,951 --> 02:31:35,161
I go,

6228
02:31:35,161 --> 02:31:35,701
not real good.

6229
02:31:35,701 --> 02:31:35,941
He goes,

6230
02:31:35,941 --> 02:31:37,230
your brain's getting destroyed.

6231
02:31:37,860 --> 02:31:41,280
Your thinking process is screwed up
because the chemicals that your stomach is

6232
02:31:41,281 --> 02:31:43,140
given off is affecting the way you think.

6233
02:31:43,140 --> 02:31:44,940
It's your second stomach
or your second brain.

6234
02:31:44,941 --> 02:31:45,630
Right.

6235
02:31:45,630 --> 02:31:45,961
He goes,

6236
02:31:45,961 --> 02:31:46,950
so you have to understand that.

6237
02:31:46,951 --> 02:31:48,150
So I quit cold Turkey,

6238
02:31:48,151 --> 02:31:48,984
stopped eating.

6239
02:31:49,310 --> 02:31:51,780
It took about a week before
my arthritis subsided.

6240
02:31:51,840 --> 02:31:52,680
Started to go away.

6241
02:31:52,710 --> 02:31:57,480
I went from running three mile runs and
feeling miserable for three days to 10

6242
02:31:57,481 --> 02:31:57,991
months later.

6243
02:31:57,991 --> 02:32:01,170
I did a 75 mile run in 10
in 10 months though from,

6244
02:32:01,260 --> 02:32:04,380
from not eating that
garbage it was it a race,

6245
02:32:04,381 --> 02:32:05,370
the 75 mile run.

6246
02:32:05,480 --> 02:32:06,780
It was actually a training run.

6247
02:32:06,781 --> 02:32:08,490
It was a training run
with the guys and that we,

6248
02:32:08,491 --> 02:32:08,730
you know,

6249
02:32:08,730 --> 02:32:08,970
they,

6250
02:32:08,970 --> 02:32:11,130
they worked me up from um,

6251
02:32:11,500 --> 02:32:11,670
you know,

6252
02:32:11,670 --> 02:32:12,391
three mile run,

6253
02:32:12,391 --> 02:32:13,290
10 mile run,

6254
02:32:13,291 --> 02:32:13,891
12 miles,

6255
02:32:13,891 --> 02:32:14,970
1518,

6256
02:32:14,971 --> 02:32:15,790
20,

6257
02:32:15,790 --> 02:32:16,050
you know,

6258
02:32:16,050 --> 02:32:18,300
drop back down to a 10
mile run on the weekend.

6259
02:32:18,301 --> 02:32:19,860
They'd always do the long
runs on the weekends.

6260
02:32:19,861 --> 02:32:22,380
And a lot of times I was doing these
runs on no sleep because I'd done a

6261
02:32:22,381 --> 02:32:23,250
broadcast Friday night,

6262
02:32:23,910 --> 02:32:24,360
get home,

6263
02:32:24,360 --> 02:32:26,580
get home the next day on Saturday,

6264
02:32:26,581 --> 02:32:26,791
half,

6265
02:32:26,791 --> 02:32:27,780
no sleep because you know,

6266
02:32:27,781 --> 02:32:30,390
you can finish late and you got to fly
home first thing in the morning is what I

6267
02:32:30,391 --> 02:32:31,224
always did,

6268
02:32:31,410 --> 02:32:36,060
operating on no sleep and then start and
we'd just 30 mile run 35 45 50 and then

6269
02:32:36,061 --> 02:32:38,040
a 75 mile run along with the stuff,

6270
02:32:38,041 --> 02:32:40,680
training during the week that a lot
of it I was doing on the road too.

6271
02:32:41,220 --> 02:32:43,920
And it's just an amazing group.

6272
02:32:43,950 --> 02:32:46,650
It's probably the coolest group
of people I've been around.

6273
02:32:46,651 --> 02:32:47,760
And David Clark,

6274
02:32:47,761 --> 02:32:52,761
who is a guy that served as a role
model for me just reading his book,

6275
02:32:53,580 --> 02:32:54,890
which is called out there,

6276
02:32:55,860 --> 02:32:59,700
ultra recovery it guy that was 320 pound
alcoholic who changed his life one day

6277
02:32:59,701 --> 02:33:02,550
and decided to become
a bad ass ultra runner.

6278
02:33:02,850 --> 02:33:03,630
Um,

6279
02:33:03,630 --> 02:33:04,170
it just,

6280
02:33:04,170 --> 02:33:05,280
being around those people,

6281
02:33:05,281 --> 02:33:05,630
they,

6282
02:33:05,630 --> 02:33:06,630
they don't show pain.

6283
02:33:06,870 --> 02:33:07,560
They don't,

6284
02:33:07,560 --> 02:33:09,900
they just don't show pain
even when they're in misery.

6285
02:33:10,890 --> 02:33:11,400
Um,

6286
02:33:11,400 --> 02:33:11,641
it's,

6287
02:33:11,641 --> 02:33:12,870
it's a weird mindset.

6288
02:33:12,900 --> 02:33:13,280
It's,

6289
02:33:13,280 --> 02:33:18,280
it's so much different than MMA where 25
minutes of misery and exhausting fight

6290
02:33:19,080 --> 02:33:19,913
is.

6291
02:33:20,040 --> 02:33:21,990
Now that I've gone through
some of this stuff,

6292
02:33:21,991 --> 02:33:22,200
it's,

6293
02:33:22,200 --> 02:33:23,033
it's a joke.

6294
02:33:23,070 --> 02:33:27,000
It's a complete joke because when
you're out there running 75 miles,

6295
02:33:27,001 --> 02:33:27,481
50 miles,

6296
02:33:27,481 --> 02:33:32,220
I ran 50 miles in 97 degree heat with
the same percentage of humidity on a

6297
02:33:32,221 --> 02:33:33,900
blacktop country road in Iowa.

6298
02:33:34,380 --> 02:33:38,790
Getting scorched went through
probably four hours of heatstroke.

6299
02:33:39,120 --> 02:33:40,320
My brain was getting cooked.

6300
02:33:40,380 --> 02:33:40,651
I mean,

6301
02:33:40,651 --> 02:33:41,670
I literally felt like I was,

6302
02:33:42,210 --> 02:33:46,350
I could die at any time and
these guys are laughing at me.

6303
02:33:47,010 --> 02:33:47,843
They're laughing.

6304
02:33:47,910 --> 02:33:52,910
They had me in a field at
mile 30 a farmer's yard
hosing me down with cold water

6305
02:33:53,461 --> 02:33:57,270
from the farmer's house just to get my
body temperature down so I could get

6306
02:33:57,271 --> 02:33:57,930
going again.

6307
02:33:57,930 --> 02:33:58,260
Right.

6308
02:33:58,260 --> 02:33:58,740
Wow.

6309
02:33:58,740 --> 02:34:00,030
Just crazy stuff like that.

6310
02:34:00,031 --> 02:34:00,151
They're,

6311
02:34:00,151 --> 02:34:01,450
they're just hardcore to,

6312
02:34:01,460 --> 02:34:05,160
it's amazing group of people and I
encourage people to work their way up,

6313
02:34:05,161 --> 02:34:07,430
try and find a running group
and try it because it's,

6314
02:34:07,550 --> 02:34:08,280
it's cool shit.

6315
02:34:08,280 --> 02:34:10,890
How often you do it now
I backed off of late.

6316
02:34:10,891 --> 02:34:11,724
I've been doing more,

6317
02:34:11,970 --> 02:34:13,740
kind of getting back into
grappling a little bit,

6318
02:34:13,770 --> 02:34:15,150
doing a little bit of kickboxing,

6319
02:34:15,480 --> 02:34:16,620
grappling even with your neck.

6320
02:34:16,660 --> 02:34:17,590
I tell people,

6321
02:34:17,591 --> 02:34:17,831
look,

6322
02:34:17,831 --> 02:34:18,700
don't go for the gold.

6323
02:34:19,890 --> 02:34:20,460
You know,

6324
02:34:20,460 --> 02:34:24,010
and I had to tell the grant and there's
a lot of good grapplers at the place.

6325
02:34:24,011 --> 02:34:25,570
I go to a summit,

6326
02:34:25,600 --> 02:34:27,340
it's a wrestling and Jujitsu facility.

6327
02:34:27,341 --> 02:34:28,141
Crossfits in there,

6328
02:34:28,141 --> 02:34:28,974
a bunch of other stuff.

6329
02:34:29,290 --> 02:34:32,230
But some of the guys that I used to
train or the senior guys down there and

6330
02:34:32,231 --> 02:34:32,380
there,

6331
02:34:32,380 --> 02:34:33,880
there's some really technical guys,

6332
02:34:33,881 --> 02:34:34,750
some 10th planet guides.

6333
02:34:34,751 --> 02:34:35,860
Actually Joel Loughlin,

6334
02:34:36,450 --> 02:34:36,760
uh,

6335
02:34:36,760 --> 02:34:37,420
follows,

6336
02:34:37,420 --> 02:34:39,130
follows that system quite a bit.

6337
02:34:39,131 --> 02:34:39,461
And he's,

6338
02:34:39,461 --> 02:34:41,230
he's former special forces guy.

6339
02:34:41,710 --> 02:34:42,800
And you know,

6340
02:34:42,850 --> 02:34:43,990
I just said to everybody,

6341
02:34:44,020 --> 02:34:45,460
the first few times I
went down there I go,

6342
02:34:45,461 --> 02:34:45,970
look,

6343
02:34:45,970 --> 02:34:47,890
I have no desire to be
a world champion again.

6344
02:34:47,891 --> 02:34:49,630
I've been paralyzed
twice from the neck down.

6345
02:34:50,500 --> 02:34:53,860
I have no desire to get into
frigging brawls with any of you.

6346
02:34:54,160 --> 02:34:54,461
I go,

6347
02:34:54,461 --> 02:34:57,190
I'm here to get back in shape and
just grapple and kind of fun again.

6348
02:34:57,280 --> 02:34:57,730
You know what I mean?

6349
02:34:57,730 --> 02:34:58,563
So let's,

6350
02:34:58,570 --> 02:34:59,440
let's understand that.

6351
02:34:59,441 --> 02:35:00,310
First and foremost,

6352
02:35:00,311 --> 02:35:02,920
if you go for crazy
submissions on my neck,

6353
02:35:02,921 --> 02:35:04,270
I'm not going to like you a whole lot.

6354
02:35:05,260 --> 02:35:06,093
So,

6355
02:35:06,370 --> 02:35:06,940
um,

6356
02:35:06,940 --> 02:35:08,080
so I'm doing a lot of that.

6357
02:35:08,170 --> 02:35:11,260
I'm slowly getting kind of back into
the mindset of ramping back up with the

6358
02:35:11,261 --> 02:35:12,800
running and stuff like that.

6359
02:35:12,801 --> 02:35:15,580
And my brother who's 58 who never ran,

6360
02:35:15,581 --> 02:35:17,260
he did Leadville last year.

6361
02:35:17,440 --> 02:35:18,273
Was it last year?

6362
02:35:19,030 --> 02:35:19,600
Yeah.

6363
02:35:19,600 --> 02:35:20,320
Um,

6364
02:35:20,320 --> 02:35:20,591
you know,

6365
02:35:20,591 --> 02:35:23,920
that's a guy that never ran
and most people take their
lifetime to be able to do

6366
02:35:23,921 --> 02:35:24,530
a marathon.

6367
02:35:24,530 --> 02:35:26,200
He did 50 miles at Leadville,

6368
02:35:26,620 --> 02:35:28,300
missed the cutoff at 50 miles,

6369
02:35:28,690 --> 02:35:32,380
but he's 58 years old and never ran
before and just he was in love with it.

6370
02:35:32,440 --> 02:35:33,550
He fell in love with it.

6371
02:35:33,551 --> 02:35:34,420
He's in the mountains,

6372
02:35:34,860 --> 02:35:35,081
you know,

6373
02:35:35,081 --> 02:35:36,310
I already live my sports streams.

6374
02:35:36,311 --> 02:35:36,700
Joe.

6375
02:35:36,700 --> 02:35:37,780
I already won a world title.

6376
02:35:37,830 --> 02:35:39,160
I've done some cool shit.

6377
02:35:39,490 --> 02:35:40,840
So to me running that,

6378
02:35:40,870 --> 02:35:42,160
when I saw the course and went,

6379
02:35:42,161 --> 02:35:42,760
this is,

6380
02:35:42,760 --> 02:35:43,750
this is intimidating,

6381
02:35:43,780 --> 02:35:45,250
this is to look at a mountain and no,

6382
02:35:45,251 --> 02:35:49,330
you've got to go over it at the 40 to 50
mile mark and then 50 to 60 going back.

6383
02:35:49,500 --> 02:35:50,620
Cause it's some scary shit.

6384
02:35:50,621 --> 02:35:51,454
It's intimidated.

6385
02:35:51,700 --> 02:35:53,500
My brother was totally
the opposite mindset.

6386
02:35:53,501 --> 02:35:54,334
He was like,

6387
02:35:54,970 --> 02:35:56,440
this is the coolest Shit
I've ever done in my life.

6388
02:35:56,470 --> 02:35:59,800
He doesn't bomb and down that mountain
was the coolest thing I've ever done in

6389
02:35:59,801 --> 02:36:00,191
my life.

6390
02:36:00,191 --> 02:36:00,911
This is amazing.

6391
02:36:00,911 --> 02:36:01,481
And I just went,

6392
02:36:01,481 --> 02:36:03,910
that's the way the mind supposed
to work for stuff like this.

6393
02:36:04,240 --> 02:36:04,750
He got it.

6394
02:36:04,750 --> 02:36:05,583
You know what I mean?

6395
02:36:05,690 --> 02:36:08,110
So well it is a lot of it
is how you approach things.

6396
02:36:08,111 --> 02:36:08,321
Right?

6397
02:36:08,321 --> 02:36:09,510
And how you approach challenges.

6398
02:36:09,520 --> 02:36:13,330
Like some people love the idea of
something being very difficult.

6399
02:36:13,331 --> 02:36:14,290
Like what a struggle.

6400
02:36:14,580 --> 02:36:15,940
I can't believe how tough that was.

6401
02:36:15,941 --> 02:36:16,511
You get out of it,

6402
02:36:16,511 --> 02:36:17,500
you feel exhilarated.

6403
02:36:17,710 --> 02:36:19,210
Whereas other people they look at it like,

6404
02:36:19,240 --> 02:36:20,110
oh no,

6405
02:36:20,111 --> 02:36:25,111
I need a couch and a beer and a sandwich
and a good TV show about fucking,

6406
02:36:26,290 --> 02:36:26,790
you know.

6407
02:36:26,790 --> 02:36:27,500
Right.

6408
02:36:27,500 --> 02:36:27,910
Whatever.

6409
02:36:27,910 --> 02:36:28,601
But I did,

6410
02:36:28,601 --> 02:36:33,220
so I did Leadville a couple of years
back and John Byrne and I went out two

6411
02:36:33,221 --> 02:36:35,320
weeks early and I had
to leave from Colorado,

6412
02:36:35,321 --> 02:36:38,680
fly back to providence to do
a broadcast and then fly back.

6413
02:36:38,681 --> 02:36:40,540
He picked me up at the
airport and we went back up.

6414
02:36:41,710 --> 02:36:43,360
But while I was with him for
the first couple of days,

6415
02:36:43,361 --> 02:36:44,800
we went out up Mount Elbert,

6416
02:36:44,801 --> 02:36:46,270
which is the tallest mountain in Colorado.

6417
02:36:46,271 --> 02:36:47,500
And I felt the altitude,

6418
02:36:47,590 --> 02:36:49,750
I felt the alligator 14
five or whatever it was.

6419
02:36:49,751 --> 02:36:50,111
And it was,

6420
02:36:50,111 --> 02:36:51,190
it was painful on the way up.

6421
02:36:51,790 --> 02:36:54,220
And then we got caught on a
storm on the top of the mountain,

6422
02:36:54,221 --> 02:36:54,911
a bad storm,

6423
02:36:54,911 --> 02:36:58,780
hail downpour and lightening hitting
everywhere all over the mountain.

6424
02:36:58,780 --> 02:37:03,760
We had the bomb down this mountain as
fast as we could and I trashed my quads.

6425
02:37:03,820 --> 02:37:04,031
Right?

6426
02:37:04,031 --> 02:37:07,000
And we're real close to the
actual race at that point,

6427
02:37:07,001 --> 02:37:07,151
right.

6428
02:37:07,151 --> 02:37:08,380
It's like a week and a half away.

6429
02:37:09,130 --> 02:37:10,290
And so then I got on a plane,

6430
02:37:10,300 --> 02:37:11,200
flew to Providence,

6431
02:37:11,890 --> 02:37:12,700
and I was panicking.

6432
02:37:12,700 --> 02:37:13,091
I was like,

6433
02:37:13,091 --> 02:37:15,710
this is some serious shit I'm about to do.

6434
02:37:15,800 --> 02:37:16,430
Right?

6435
02:37:16,430 --> 02:37:17,630
And I started sweating.

6436
02:37:17,660 --> 02:37:19,610
I'd never had anxiety
attacks before in my life.

6437
02:37:19,611 --> 02:37:19,941
And I'm like,

6438
02:37:19,941 --> 02:37:21,350
what the fuck are you thinking,

6439
02:37:21,351 --> 02:37:22,040
dude,

6440
02:37:22,040 --> 02:37:23,330
this is some crazy stuff.

6441
02:37:23,660 --> 02:37:24,890
And so I,

6442
02:37:25,310 --> 02:37:27,830
we were getting ready to go live and
Michael Chavela looks at me and he goes,

6443
02:37:27,831 --> 02:37:29,240
why are you soaked?

6444
02:37:30,260 --> 02:37:30,621
I go,

6445
02:37:30,621 --> 02:37:31,940
I'm fucking freaking out,

6446
02:37:31,950 --> 02:37:32,200
dude.

6447
02:37:32,200 --> 02:37:33,500
I got to fly back to Colorado.

6448
02:37:33,501 --> 02:37:34,101
Go do this race.

6449
02:37:34,101 --> 02:37:35,000
I'm panicking.

6450
02:37:35,001 --> 02:37:35,834
Right?

6451
02:37:35,840 --> 02:37:39,200
And I never thought I'd be afraid of
anything but that the course is that

6452
02:37:39,201 --> 02:37:39,800
intimidating.

6453
02:37:39,800 --> 02:37:40,633
Right.

6454
02:37:40,940 --> 02:37:41,571
So Michael Goes,

6455
02:37:41,571 --> 02:37:42,050
dude,

6456
02:37:42,050 --> 02:37:42,681
relax.

6457
02:37:42,681 --> 02:37:43,221
It's okay.

6458
02:37:43,221 --> 02:37:44,090
So we did the show,

6459
02:37:44,091 --> 02:37:45,950
everything I got back there and it,

6460
02:37:46,040 --> 02:37:46,401
you know,

6461
02:37:46,401 --> 02:37:47,780
when you're out there in the mountains,

6462
02:37:47,870 --> 02:37:49,400
you start at four o'clock in the morning.

6463
02:37:50,060 --> 02:37:50,880
And these,

6464
02:37:50,880 --> 02:37:51,471
they're just,

6465
02:37:51,471 --> 02:37:52,490
they're hardcore runners,

6466
02:37:52,491 --> 02:37:52,750
man.

6467
02:37:52,750 --> 02:37:53,900
They're hardcore bad assets.

6468
02:37:53,901 --> 02:37:54,171
People.

6469
02:37:54,171 --> 02:37:55,580
You'd never,

6470
02:37:55,900 --> 02:37:56,960
if you looked at them on the street,

6471
02:37:56,961 --> 02:37:57,141
you go,

6472
02:37:57,141 --> 02:37:59,090
there's no way that person
could run five miles.

6473
02:37:59,540 --> 02:38:01,310
And they're just smiling
for a hundred miles.

6474
02:38:01,311 --> 02:38:02,000
They're just going,

6475
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:02,380
going,

6476
02:38:02,380 --> 02:38:02,710
you know,

6477
02:38:02,710 --> 02:38:03,560
so Courtney,

6478
02:38:03,710 --> 02:38:04,221
Courtney doe,

6479
02:38:04,221 --> 02:38:04,701
Walter is,

6480
02:38:04,701 --> 02:38:05,060
right,

6481
02:38:05,060 --> 02:38:05,360
right.

6482
02:38:05,360 --> 02:38:10,360
I had her on and she wanted the Moab
to 40 by how many hours she beat the 10

6483
02:38:10,911 --> 02:38:12,470
hours and 20 miles.

6484
02:38:12,680 --> 02:38:14,000
She beat the second place guy.

6485
02:38:14,120 --> 02:38:14,960
That's amazing.

6486
02:38:15,950 --> 02:38:17,930
Were there people that thought
she cheated to do that?

6487
02:38:17,960 --> 02:38:18,390
Nope.

6488
02:38:18,390 --> 02:38:19,223
They newer.

6489
02:38:19,360 --> 02:38:20,180
Everybody knew her.

6490
02:38:20,180 --> 02:38:20,930
She's an animal.

6491
02:38:20,930 --> 02:38:21,130
She,

6492
02:38:21,130 --> 02:38:22,910
she won a race blind.

6493
02:38:23,330 --> 02:38:26,690
She was having some sort of retinal edema
so she couldn't see anything but her

6494
02:38:26,691 --> 02:38:29,240
feet [inaudible] had to tell her where
to go and all that sort of stuff.

6495
02:38:29,240 --> 02:38:30,110
She had a pacer.

6496
02:38:30,320 --> 02:38:32,540
She tripped and fell and
cracked her head open.

6497
02:38:32,541 --> 02:38:32,801
She,

6498
02:38:32,801 --> 02:38:34,250
she went through the finish line.

6499
02:38:34,280 --> 02:38:35,540
Bloody and blind.

6500
02:38:35,720 --> 02:38:36,560
That's the toughest stuff.

6501
02:38:36,561 --> 02:38:38,360
And that's one of the toughest
people you're ever going to meet.

6502
02:38:38,390 --> 02:38:38,650
Right?

6503
02:38:38,650 --> 02:38:38,870
Right.

6504
02:38:38,870 --> 02:38:40,610
If you met her completely unassuming,

6505
02:38:40,670 --> 02:38:41,720
thin woman,

6506
02:38:41,960 --> 02:38:43,460
real silly drinks,

6507
02:38:43,461 --> 02:38:44,970
beer and eat Nachos,

6508
02:38:45,020 --> 02:38:47,510
not on some kind of crazy die eats candy.

6509
02:38:47,930 --> 02:38:48,350
Right.

6510
02:38:48,350 --> 02:38:49,580
She's real fun to hang out with.

6511
02:38:49,590 --> 02:38:50,720
That's like very easy going.

6512
02:38:50,750 --> 02:38:52,400
That's like you meet
Navy seals and you go,

6513
02:38:52,401 --> 02:38:53,300
they're supposed to be tough.

6514
02:38:53,301 --> 02:38:53,570
Right,

6515
02:38:53,570 --> 02:38:53,930
right.

6516
02:38:53,930 --> 02:38:57,020
But I watched navy seals fall apart
last year when my brother was doing the

6517
02:38:57,021 --> 02:38:57,530
race,

6518
02:38:57,530 --> 02:38:58,700
like just fall apart.

6519
02:38:58,790 --> 02:38:59,530
Just Whitley.

6520
02:38:59,530 --> 02:38:59,870
Yet.

6521
02:38:59,870 --> 02:39:00,980
Just like,

6522
02:39:01,160 --> 02:39:01,251
well,

6523
02:39:01,251 --> 02:39:03,410
if you're not physically prepared to wow,

6524
02:39:03,411 --> 02:39:03,661
you know,

6525
02:39:03,661 --> 02:39:04,130
they didn't,

6526
02:39:04,130 --> 02:39:06,290
I know that some of them
did the 50 miler out there.

6527
02:39:06,291 --> 02:39:07,080
Right.

6528
02:39:07,080 --> 02:39:08,480
So they were getting ready for it.

6529
02:39:08,480 --> 02:39:09,870
But you know,

6530
02:39:09,900 --> 02:39:10,640
the,

6531
02:39:10,640 --> 02:39:14,160
you get dehydrated at any point
or caloric deficit or all this,

6532
02:39:14,260 --> 02:39:17,450
these different altitude problems that
can come about all the other stuff,

6533
02:39:17,451 --> 02:39:17,691
you know,

6534
02:39:17,691 --> 02:39:17,990
it's,

6535
02:39:17,990 --> 02:39:18,823
it's uh,

6536
02:39:19,270 --> 02:39:19,581
it's,

6537
02:39:19,581 --> 02:39:21,710
it's definitely a mental thing that,

6538
02:39:21,740 --> 02:39:22,540
yes,

6539
02:39:22,540 --> 02:39:23,250
it's wild.

6540
02:39:23,250 --> 02:39:25,610
So fighting is the way I look at it.

6541
02:39:25,640 --> 02:39:28,250
The best way I can explain to you
as fighting is so fucking easy.

6542
02:39:28,740 --> 02:39:29,600
Finding the Harrison.

6543
02:39:29,750 --> 02:39:29,991
Yeah.

6544
02:39:29,991 --> 02:39:30,824
I mean,

6545
02:39:31,160 --> 02:39:31,941
in reality,

6546
02:39:31,941 --> 02:39:35,420
I mean I was fighting like when I fought
Palae when he was ranked second in the

6547
02:39:35,421 --> 02:39:35,650
world,

6548
02:39:35,650 --> 02:39:36,483
I was ranked first.

6549
02:39:37,190 --> 02:39:39,620
I didn't train for six weeks for
that fight cause I was crippled,

6550
02:39:39,830 --> 02:39:40,370
right?

6551
02:39:40,370 --> 02:39:40,911
I was injured,

6552
02:39:40,911 --> 02:39:41,361
low back,

6553
02:39:41,361 --> 02:39:41,901
destroyed,

6554
02:39:41,901 --> 02:39:42,441
all kinds of stuff.

6555
02:39:42,441 --> 02:39:45,160
I had 12 shots as Aila came into
my back to go out and fight.

6556
02:39:45,260 --> 02:39:47,870
He's crying and he was the number two
guy in the world at the time and very

6557
02:39:47,871 --> 02:39:48,261
athletic,

6558
02:39:48,261 --> 02:39:49,940
a fucking killer at the time.

6559
02:39:49,970 --> 02:39:51,290
But he couldn't do shit to hurt me.

6560
02:39:51,291 --> 02:39:52,340
Even when I was crippled,

6561
02:39:52,370 --> 02:39:55,190
he fell back for a leg lock on me
and I laughed at him and he was like,

6562
02:39:55,191 --> 02:39:55,401
well,

6563
02:39:55,401 --> 02:39:56,080
that's not going to work,

6564
02:39:56,080 --> 02:39:57,560
so let's get right.

6565
02:39:57,770 --> 02:40:00,620
But he was hanging on my head and I'm
throwing up her cuts and body shots and

6566
02:40:00,621 --> 02:40:01,251
he's plumbing me.

6567
02:40:01,251 --> 02:40:04,790
He ran up my body with knees like that,

6568
02:40:04,791 --> 02:40:05,001
you know,

6569
02:40:05,001 --> 02:40:05,541
just a freak.

6570
02:40:05,541 --> 02:40:06,770
But fighting is that easy.

6571
02:40:06,771 --> 02:40:10,460
It's that simple to me because you're
trying to outwit now smarter than other

6572
02:40:10,461 --> 02:40:11,090
human beings.

6573
02:40:11,090 --> 02:40:11,421
Right?

6574
02:40:11,421 --> 02:40:12,254
Right.

6575
02:40:12,740 --> 02:40:14,670
When you're running for 50 miles,

6576
02:40:14,671 --> 02:40:15,540
75 miles,

6577
02:40:15,541 --> 02:40:15,901
whatever,

6578
02:40:15,901 --> 02:40:19,290
a hundred miles you battling
with yourself the entire time.

6579
02:40:19,310 --> 02:40:19,770
Yes.

6580
02:40:19,770 --> 02:40:21,180
That's where you get mind fucked.

6581
02:40:21,220 --> 02:40:21,611
Right,

6582
02:40:21,611 --> 02:40:21,871
right,

6583
02:40:21,871 --> 02:40:22,560
right.

6584
02:40:22,560 --> 02:40:23,940
That's the scary part about it.

6585
02:40:24,030 --> 02:40:25,290
Cause you gotta face yourself.

6586
02:40:25,590 --> 02:40:26,423
Yeah.

6587
02:40:27,120 --> 02:40:27,391
Yeah.

6588
02:40:27,391 --> 02:40:28,470
It's a different thing.

6589
02:40:28,620 --> 02:40:28,981
Yeah.

6590
02:40:28,981 --> 02:40:29,261
You're,

6591
02:40:29,261 --> 02:40:29,970
you're in.

6592
02:40:29,970 --> 02:40:31,170
You're in the middle of a fight,

6593
02:40:31,171 --> 02:40:32,130
especially a war.

6594
02:40:32,130 --> 02:40:35,670
You're in the moment you're throwing
bombs and acting and reacting and just

6595
02:40:35,671 --> 02:40:38,070
doing it and dealing with
it and toughen it up.

6596
02:40:38,071 --> 02:40:39,120
You take a minute break,

6597
02:40:39,121 --> 02:40:39,841
drink some water,

6598
02:40:39,841 --> 02:40:41,610
hop right back out again for five minutes.

6599
02:40:42,080 --> 02:40:43,890
Is it just a completely different animal?

6600
02:40:43,920 --> 02:40:44,071
Right.

6601
02:40:44,071 --> 02:40:46,260
You do you miss the old
days of no time limits.

6602
02:40:46,680 --> 02:40:46,951
Uh,

6603
02:40:46,951 --> 02:40:50,130
I had fun back in those days because I
could go a hundred miles an hour in gas

6604
02:40:50,131 --> 02:40:50,941
people out and beat them.

6605
02:40:50,941 --> 02:40:51,180
Right,

6606
02:40:51,180 --> 02:40:51,630
right.

6607
02:40:51,630 --> 02:40:52,410
With the conditioning.

6608
02:40:52,410 --> 02:40:53,243
I enjoyed that.

6609
02:40:53,280 --> 02:40:53,881
I did.

6610
02:40:53,881 --> 02:40:54,930
I did enjoy that.

6611
02:40:55,020 --> 02:40:55,853
Um,

6612
02:40:56,280 --> 02:40:58,020
but you know,

6613
02:40:58,021 --> 02:40:58,351
it is,

6614
02:40:58,351 --> 02:40:59,081
it is what it is.

6615
02:40:59,081 --> 02:40:59,914
It's the,

6616
02:40:59,940 --> 02:41:03,810
there were fights in tournaments that
would go 45 minutes and just show you

6617
02:41:03,811 --> 02:41:05,280
can't cover that on TV.

6618
02:41:05,340 --> 02:41:05,581
Right,

6619
02:41:05,581 --> 02:41:05,761
right,

6620
02:41:05,761 --> 02:41:05,921
right.

6621
02:41:05,921 --> 02:41:06,721
We just can't keep,

6622
02:41:06,721 --> 02:41:07,554
he fought Dan.

6623
02:41:07,800 --> 02:41:09,030
Was that a no time limit?

6624
02:41:09,310 --> 02:41:10,370
Third argument,

6625
02:41:10,371 --> 02:41:11,204
that one round fight.

6626
02:41:11,250 --> 02:41:11,461
Yeah.

6627
02:41:11,461 --> 02:41:12,240
That's crazy.

6628
02:41:12,240 --> 02:41:12,931
So it's just,

6629
02:41:12,931 --> 02:41:13,650
it is what it is.

6630
02:41:13,650 --> 02:41:14,280
People,

6631
02:41:14,280 --> 02:41:16,080
people would sit down and watch it live,

6632
02:41:16,860 --> 02:41:18,450
but they're not going to watch it on TV.

6633
02:41:18,451 --> 02:41:19,760
Even though you're going to pay for,

6634
02:41:19,820 --> 02:41:21,210
for you get bummed out.

6635
02:41:21,240 --> 02:41:21,481
Right.

6636
02:41:21,481 --> 02:41:23,070
It's just not the best thing.

6637
02:41:23,071 --> 02:41:24,480
In terms of entertainment value.

6638
02:41:24,560 --> 02:41:25,170
No,

6639
02:41:25,170 --> 02:41:25,740
not at all.

6640
02:41:25,740 --> 02:41:26,071
Not at all.

6641
02:41:26,071 --> 02:41:26,850
So it's,

6642
02:41:26,850 --> 02:41:27,061
you know,

6643
02:41:27,061 --> 02:41:27,894
the rounds,

6644
02:41:28,080 --> 02:41:29,280
the rules,

6645
02:41:29,281 --> 02:41:30,150
all that sort of stuff.

6646
02:41:30,151 --> 02:41:33,780
That the way you look at some girls
in bikinis is in between rounds.

6647
02:41:34,530 --> 02:41:35,650
Walk around with the cards.

6648
02:41:36,250 --> 02:41:36,510
You know,

6649
02:41:36,510 --> 02:41:37,410
I talked to John Perretti,

6650
02:41:37,411 --> 02:41:39,780
we had John Perretti on one
of my podcasts actually.

6651
02:41:39,781 --> 02:41:40,140
Yeah.

6652
02:41:40,140 --> 02:41:40,973
How's he doing?

6653
02:41:41,020 --> 02:41:42,450
I know he's got some health issues,

6654
02:41:42,470 --> 02:41:42,860
you know,

6655
02:41:42,860 --> 02:41:43,250
I think he's,

6656
02:41:43,250 --> 02:41:43,501
he's,

6657
02:41:43,501 --> 02:41:45,930
I know he's got the MS and some
other issues and stuff like that,

6658
02:41:45,931 --> 02:41:46,470
but,

6659
02:41:46,470 --> 02:41:47,303
um,

6660
02:41:47,340 --> 02:41:47,700
you know,

6661
02:41:47,700 --> 02:41:48,180
he,

6662
02:41:48,180 --> 02:41:50,100
he wants people to know that
he's the guy that did that.

6663
02:41:50,130 --> 02:41:50,600
He did.

6664
02:41:50,600 --> 02:41:51,210
Right.

6665
02:41:51,210 --> 02:41:54,330
He wants people to know I'm the guy
that frigging created all that stuff.

6666
02:41:54,750 --> 02:41:55,060
Well,

6667
02:41:55,060 --> 02:41:58,540
he was the matchmaker at the time when
I first started working for the UFC in

6668
02:41:58,541 --> 02:41:59,101
[inaudible] 97.

6669
02:41:59,101 --> 02:41:59,710
Okay.

6670
02:41:59,710 --> 02:42:00,420
And um,

6671
02:42:00,420 --> 02:42:02,730
so it has been since 97 you were involved?

6672
02:42:02,820 --> 02:42:03,510
Yeah,

6673
02:42:03,510 --> 02:42:04,620
I did UFC 12.

6674
02:42:04,650 --> 02:42:05,161
That's awesome.

6675
02:42:05,161 --> 02:42:05,400
Okay.

6676
02:42:05,400 --> 02:42:05,701
Yeah,

6677
02:42:05,701 --> 02:42:06,350
that was the,

6678
02:42:06,350 --> 02:42:07,590
and I came in at 16,

6679
02:42:07,591 --> 02:42:08,790
so you've been around longer than me.

6680
02:42:08,791 --> 02:42:09,510
That's awesome.

6681
02:42:09,510 --> 02:42:09,631
Yeah.

6682
02:42:09,631 --> 02:42:10,740
I remember your debut.

6683
02:42:10,860 --> 02:42:13,500
I remember when I was,

6684
02:42:13,501 --> 02:42:14,334
um,

6685
02:42:14,460 --> 02:42:15,600
I remember Mikey Burnett.

6686
02:42:15,960 --> 02:42:16,793
How's he doing?

6687
02:42:17,760 --> 02:42:18,480
He's doing,

6688
02:42:18,480 --> 02:42:18,781
I think.

6689
02:42:18,781 --> 02:42:19,231
Okay.

6690
02:42:19,231 --> 02:42:20,250
I know he got shot,

6691
02:42:20,280 --> 02:42:20,790
right?

6692
02:42:20,790 --> 02:42:21,090
Yeah,

6693
02:42:21,090 --> 02:42:21,923
the robbery.

6694
02:42:22,580 --> 02:42:23,550
He was a good guy.

6695
02:42:24,090 --> 02:42:24,990
Tough motherfucker.

6696
02:42:24,991 --> 02:42:28,890
I remember when he fought Eugenio to
Dale and rectum rectum when everybody

6697
02:42:28,891 --> 02:42:31,440
thought that he was the next guy.

6698
02:42:31,441 --> 02:42:32,590
Genio was a psychopath.

6699
02:42:32,650 --> 02:42:35,850
Friggin went after hen zone was kicking
handles ass and they shut the power down

6700
02:42:35,851 --> 02:42:36,331
in the building,

6701
02:42:36,331 --> 02:42:37,320
so hands up wouldn't lose.

6702
02:42:38,340 --> 02:42:39,210
That was in Brazil,

6703
02:42:39,211 --> 02:42:39,630
right?

6704
02:42:39,630 --> 02:42:40,370
That was crazy.

6705
02:42:40,370 --> 02:42:41,130
It was back then.

6706
02:42:41,130 --> 02:42:41,431
Yeah.

6707
02:42:41,431 --> 02:42:42,264
But Burnett was,

6708
02:42:42,720 --> 02:42:45,270
Mikey Burnett was a guy who
was a Greco national champ.

6709
02:42:45,960 --> 02:42:49,470
Benched four oh five squatted
four oh five stronger than shit.

6710
02:42:49,640 --> 02:42:50,400
Toughest fuck.

6711
02:42:50,400 --> 02:42:50,820
Yeah,

6712
02:42:50,820 --> 02:42:51,653
yeah,

6713
02:42:51,780 --> 02:42:52,613
the old days.

6714
02:42:53,220 --> 02:42:53,790
Yeah.

6715
02:42:53,790 --> 02:42:54,481
Fuck man.

6716
02:42:54,481 --> 02:42:55,350
It's been so long.

6717
02:42:55,380 --> 02:42:57,330
It's really interesting when
you stop and think about it,

6718
02:42:57,360 --> 02:42:59,070
how many thousands of
flights with you called?

6719
02:42:59,460 --> 02:43:01,260
I've seen way too many
people get fucked up.

6720
02:43:01,350 --> 02:43:02,100
I know that.

6721
02:43:02,100 --> 02:43:03,690
I'm real numb to watch it.

6722
02:43:03,691 --> 02:43:04,530
People get beat up.

6723
02:43:04,750 --> 02:43:05,220
That's my,

6724
02:43:05,220 --> 02:43:05,970
and that's the thing.

6725
02:43:05,970 --> 02:43:07,170
That's too,

6726
02:43:08,070 --> 02:43:10,530
I would say as my coaching
career progressed,

6727
02:43:10,531 --> 02:43:11,364
as I got older,

6728
02:43:11,470 --> 02:43:15,580
you know when you're young and you're
full of testosterone in near a psychopath

6729
02:43:16,060 --> 02:43:16,930
and you're coaching,

6730
02:43:16,931 --> 02:43:17,261
it's just,

6731
02:43:17,261 --> 02:43:17,470
Oh,

6732
02:43:17,470 --> 02:43:18,303
let's go do this.

6733
02:43:18,520 --> 02:43:18,791
Right,

6734
02:43:18,791 --> 02:43:19,450
right.

6735
02:43:19,450 --> 02:43:21,610
And as I got older and mellowed out,

6736
02:43:22,420 --> 02:43:25,720
I mean I had to lay down on the floor of
the locker room before the first Hugh's

6737
02:43:25,721 --> 02:43:26,554
trig fight.

6738
02:43:26,680 --> 02:43:28,510
Cause I knew Trigg was a dangerous dude,

6739
02:43:28,570 --> 02:43:30,580
just a tough son of a
bitch and a good wrestler.

6740
02:43:30,581 --> 02:43:31,414
Right.

6741
02:43:31,630 --> 02:43:33,130
And I was really nervous for that fight.

6742
02:43:33,131 --> 02:43:36,130
I had to lay on my back
and just decompress for 30
minutes before that fight

6743
02:43:36,190 --> 02:43:39,180
just to go out and just coach with,

6744
02:43:39,250 --> 02:43:39,850
you know,

6745
02:43:39,850 --> 02:43:40,990
with a car mine,

6746
02:43:41,530 --> 02:43:41,911
you know,

6747
02:43:41,911 --> 02:43:42,080
and,

6748
02:43:42,080 --> 02:43:42,913
and uh,

6749
02:43:43,390 --> 02:43:43,780
you know,

6750
02:43:43,780 --> 02:43:45,400
when he was fought Carlos Newton,

6751
02:43:45,401 --> 02:43:49,690
after Carlos took the title from me and
Carlos comes out and we were infuriated

6752
02:43:49,691 --> 02:43:51,940
because he's walking out with
two playboy bunnies and you know,

6753
02:43:52,040 --> 02:43:52,990
acting and that was,

6754
02:43:52,991 --> 02:43:53,231
you know,

6755
02:43:53,231 --> 02:43:53,741
it's a show,

6756
02:43:53,741 --> 02:43:54,010
right?

6757
02:43:54,010 --> 02:43:54,461
It's a show.

6758
02:43:54,461 --> 02:43:55,900
It's how it was when that big ramp.

6759
02:43:56,850 --> 02:43:57,220
Right.

6760
02:43:57,220 --> 02:44:01,060
And so he was standing there and I
was all pumped up and I was like,

6761
02:44:01,061 --> 02:44:01,870
Matt,

6762
02:44:01,870 --> 02:44:02,291
you know,

6763
02:44:02,291 --> 02:44:04,720
we had to get mad off a tractor
on the farm to come and fight him.

6764
02:44:04,780 --> 02:44:05,350
Right?

6765
02:44:05,350 --> 02:44:07,210
Cause my automatic rematch clause got,

6766
02:44:07,240 --> 02:44:09,850
they reneged on that and
say it's your choice.

6767
02:44:09,851 --> 02:44:11,860
Either Mac and fight him or
somebody from another camp.

6768
02:44:11,861 --> 02:44:13,420
But if Matt or somebody from another,

6769
02:44:13,480 --> 02:44:14,850
if somebody from another camp fights,

6770
02:44:14,851 --> 02:44:16,090
I mean you've got the
winter no matter what.

6771
02:44:16,780 --> 02:44:18,220
But if Matt fights him and loses,

6772
02:44:18,221 --> 02:44:18,580
you can,

6773
02:44:18,580 --> 02:44:19,870
you can rematch Carlos.

6774
02:44:19,871 --> 02:44:20,651
But if Matt wins,

6775
02:44:20,651 --> 02:44:22,480
obviously that's Kinda
tough cause we're buddies.

6776
02:44:22,481 --> 02:44:22,780
Right?

6777
02:44:22,780 --> 02:44:23,613
Right.

6778
02:44:23,710 --> 02:44:26,020
So Matt standing inside
the cage and I'm pumped.

6779
02:44:26,380 --> 02:44:27,070
Absolutely pumped.

6780
02:44:27,070 --> 02:44:27,221
I go,

6781
02:44:27,221 --> 02:44:28,280
you got to smash this guy.

6782
02:44:28,281 --> 02:44:28,781
I'm screaming.

6783
02:44:28,781 --> 02:44:29,021
And it was,

6784
02:44:29,021 --> 02:44:30,120
you got to fucking smash him.

6785
02:44:30,460 --> 02:44:32,320
And Matt turns around and he goes,

6786
02:44:32,470 --> 02:44:33,101
it's going to be okay,

6787
02:44:33,101 --> 02:44:33,934
dude.

6788
02:44:34,450 --> 02:44:35,283
All right.

6789
02:44:35,350 --> 02:44:35,621
He goes,

6790
02:44:35,621 --> 02:44:36,454
we got this dude,

6791
02:44:36,460 --> 02:44:37,180
we got this.

6792
02:44:37,180 --> 02:44:37,630
I was like,

6793
02:44:37,630 --> 02:44:38,463
all right.

6794
02:44:38,710 --> 02:44:39,780
That was a crazy winter.

6795
02:44:39,790 --> 02:44:41,410
That's when he slammed
him with a triangle.

6796
02:44:41,440 --> 02:44:42,130
Yeah.

6797
02:44:42,130 --> 02:44:42,963
Yeah.

6798
02:44:43,960 --> 02:44:44,710
The entire crowd.

6799
02:44:44,710 --> 02:44:45,760
Their mouths were hanging open.

6800
02:44:45,970 --> 02:44:47,110
They'd never seen anything like that.

6801
02:44:47,111 --> 02:44:47,410
And they're like,

6802
02:44:47,410 --> 02:44:48,910
well was he kinda half out?

6803
02:44:49,300 --> 02:44:50,260
He was out triangle.

6804
02:44:50,290 --> 02:44:51,370
He was just out with the triangle.

6805
02:44:51,460 --> 02:44:54,820
[inaudible] was going out and
slammed him and then went out.

6806
02:44:54,850 --> 02:44:55,683
Here's the thing,

6807
02:44:56,780 --> 02:44:57,730
that's why he jumped up and said,

6808
02:44:57,731 --> 02:44:58,391
I want Matt.

6809
02:44:58,391 --> 02:44:58,571
No,

6810
02:44:58,571 --> 02:45:03,370
Matt sits up like this and he's kind of
looking around and I dove over the cage

6811
02:45:03,430 --> 02:45:08,430
and my let my legs catch on one side so
that that could barely touch Matt's head

6812
02:45:08,920 --> 02:45:09,491
with my hand.

6813
02:45:09,491 --> 02:45:10,960
And they scraped his hair
really fast and I'm like,

6814
02:45:10,961 --> 02:45:11,201
get up,

6815
02:45:11,201 --> 02:45:11,441
get up,

6816
02:45:11,441 --> 02:45:11,711
get up,

6817
02:45:11,711 --> 02:45:12,010
get up.

6818
02:45:12,010 --> 02:45:12,843
I knew he was out.

6819
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:13,270
Right,

6820
02:45:13,270 --> 02:45:14,021
so get up,

6821
02:45:14,021 --> 02:45:15,280
get up and he stands up and he goes,

6822
02:45:15,970 --> 02:45:16,803
what happened?

6823
02:45:17,050 --> 02:45:17,681
And Jeremy Goes,

6824
02:45:17,681 --> 02:45:18,580
he's just one of these like

6825
02:45:21,310 --> 02:45:21,970
crazy.

6826
02:45:21,970 --> 02:45:22,600
That was cool.

6827
02:45:22,600 --> 02:45:23,530
That was a cool fight.

6828
02:45:24,250 --> 02:45:24,580
Yeah.

6829
02:45:24,580 --> 02:45:25,240
Very intense.

6830
02:45:25,240 --> 02:45:25,391
Yeah,

6831
02:45:25,391 --> 02:45:26,230
that was very intense.

6832
02:45:26,231 --> 02:45:28,990
Carlos Newton was one of the
most technical Jujitsu guys.

6833
02:45:29,020 --> 02:45:29,853
Oh yeah.

6834
02:45:29,980 --> 02:45:31,990
He was very athletic dude.

6835
02:45:32,100 --> 02:45:32,790
Yeah.

6836
02:45:32,790 --> 02:45:36,100
One of the best sites I've ever seen
to this day was he and Dan Henderson.

6837
02:45:36,400 --> 02:45:36,970
Oh yeah.

6838
02:45:36,970 --> 02:45:38,320
That was an insane fight.

6839
02:45:38,321 --> 02:45:38,680
Yeah,

6840
02:45:38,680 --> 02:45:39,590
those guys are great fight.

6841
02:45:39,790 --> 02:45:43,110
That was 97 [inaudible] 97 and
possibly somewhere in that era.

6842
02:45:43,420 --> 02:45:44,590
That was one of my early days.

6843
02:45:44,620 --> 02:45:46,900
I remember when Chuck
Ladell made his UFC debut.

6844
02:45:47,230 --> 02:45:50,350
I think he fought noe Hernandez and
appreciate he's wearing wrestling shoes.

6845
02:45:50,380 --> 02:45:50,631
No,

6846
02:45:50,631 --> 02:45:52,600
he Hernandez trained
with me for that fight.

6847
02:45:52,601 --> 02:45:53,434
And no,

6848
02:45:53,490 --> 02:45:54,850
he got hurt before that flight.

6849
02:45:54,851 --> 02:45:56,080
I can't remember what he injured,

6850
02:45:56,740 --> 02:45:57,431
but no,

6851
02:45:57,431 --> 02:45:58,810
he couldn't train hard for that fight.

6852
02:45:58,811 --> 02:46:00,010
So he wasn't in great shape.

6853
02:46:00,040 --> 02:46:02,770
But he was knocking the shit out
of chuck until he ran out of gas.

6854
02:46:02,771 --> 02:46:04,690
I mean he was boxing Chuck's ears off,

6855
02:46:05,150 --> 02:46:06,060
knocking down a flight.

6856
02:46:06,080 --> 02:46:09,380
Peretti came to chuck and told them if
you want to keep working and to keep

6857
02:46:09,381 --> 02:46:10,400
fighting for the UFC,

6858
02:46:10,400 --> 02:46:11,660
do not take this guy down.

6859
02:46:12,200 --> 02:46:12,621
Oh really?

6860
02:46:12,621 --> 02:46:12,921
Yeah,

6861
02:46:12,921 --> 02:46:14,420
because they found out
the chuck was a wrestler.

6862
02:46:14,510 --> 02:46:16,160
Ah Wow.

6863
02:46:16,280 --> 02:46:16,520
This,

6864
02:46:16,520 --> 02:46:18,020
those are the dirty days.

6865
02:46:19,250 --> 02:46:20,750
That was a Gary shot.

6866
02:46:20,780 --> 02:46:21,430
The Gary Shaw,

6867
02:46:21,430 --> 02:46:21,980
him,

6868
02:46:21,980 --> 02:46:23,950
Petros Ellian sharematch type stuff.

6869
02:46:23,960 --> 02:46:24,793
Right.

6870
02:46:24,880 --> 02:46:27,650
Petros only had to stand up with
Kimbo cause he replaced shamrock.

6871
02:46:27,730 --> 02:46:28,760
Aw Man,

6872
02:46:28,880 --> 02:46:30,320
I forgot about that guy.

6873
02:46:30,380 --> 02:46:33,200
One of the greatest interviews
ever was Dana white after that.

6874
02:46:33,950 --> 02:46:35,360
Remember when he looks at
the camera and he goes,

6875
02:46:35,361 --> 02:46:35,931
you can't do that.

6876
02:46:35,931 --> 02:46:38,450
It's book and that's fucking illegal.

6877
02:46:38,451 --> 02:46:38,841
Yeah,

6878
02:46:38,841 --> 02:46:40,010
it is fucking illegal.

6879
02:46:40,190 --> 02:46:42,440
That was the dumbest matchup to when I,

6880
02:46:42,441 --> 02:46:46,700
there's a video of me in the green
room of the punchline in Atlanta,

6881
02:46:46,701 --> 02:46:47,534
Georgia.

6882
02:46:47,600 --> 02:46:52,460
I had gotten off stage and I was waiting
to see Ken shamrock fight keep Kimbo

6883
02:46:52,490 --> 02:46:52,790
okay.

6884
02:46:52,790 --> 02:46:53,211
And I was like,

6885
02:46:53,211 --> 02:46:54,380
what a fight this is going to be.

6886
02:46:54,530 --> 02:46:56,960
I get off stage and they say,

6887
02:46:57,020 --> 02:46:57,410
oh,

6888
02:46:57,410 --> 02:47:02,410
Ken shamrock got hurt and warming up
and Kimbo is now fighting Seth Petras

6889
02:47:02,690 --> 02:47:03,170
Ellie.

6890
02:47:03,170 --> 02:47:03,650
And I go,

6891
02:47:03,650 --> 02:47:03,861
oh,

6892
02:47:03,861 --> 02:47:05,350
this is a terrible idea.

6893
02:47:05,370 --> 02:47:08,330
Fucking and I said it
and I said to the camera,

6894
02:47:08,420 --> 02:47:09,530
it's like the craziest thing ever.

6895
02:47:09,531 --> 02:47:10,040
I go,

6896
02:47:10,040 --> 02:47:10,791
Seth Patch jail.

6897
02:47:10,791 --> 02:47:11,690
He's gonna fuck him up.

6898
02:47:12,050 --> 02:47:12,471
I'm like,

6899
02:47:12,471 --> 02:47:12,801
this is,

6900
02:47:12,801 --> 02:47:14,370
we're assuming he's going to
take him down and submit it.

6901
02:47:14,420 --> 02:47:14,810
And He,

6902
02:47:14,810 --> 02:47:16,130
I thought he was going to KLM.

6903
02:47:16,580 --> 02:47:18,050
Seth was way better striker.

6904
02:47:18,080 --> 02:47:19,460
I thought something was
going to take him down.

6905
02:47:19,490 --> 02:47:21,500
I thought Seth is a karate striker,

6906
02:47:21,501 --> 02:47:24,160
like at legit season black belts.

6907
02:47:24,161 --> 02:47:24,380
Right.

6908
02:47:24,380 --> 02:47:24,580
And,

6909
02:47:24,580 --> 02:47:24,861
and,

6910
02:47:24,861 --> 02:47:25,370
and uh,

6911
02:47:25,370 --> 02:47:26,840
he could submit guys,

6912
02:47:26,930 --> 02:47:27,620
but he's just a,

6913
02:47:27,620 --> 02:47:30,290
he was on another level
as a mixed martial artist.

6914
02:47:30,291 --> 02:47:31,980
I was like Kimbos ineffective.

6915
02:47:32,120 --> 02:47:35,390
So here's me while this is happening,

6916
02:47:35,670 --> 02:47:38,070
if I'm wrong and never see
this to go to the beginning,

6917
02:47:38,700 --> 02:47:39,090
hold on.

6918
02:47:39,090 --> 02:47:40,830
It's what it said in the beginning.

6919
02:47:41,170 --> 02:47:42,280
Fuck Kimbo slice.

6920
02:47:42,510 --> 02:47:43,840
This is a last minute replacement.

6921
02:47:44,070 --> 02:47:44,930
I got to take set parts.

6922
02:47:44,980 --> 02:47:45,640
Set purchase though.

6923
02:47:45,640 --> 02:47:46,473
He's gonna fuck him up

6924
02:47:47,980 --> 02:47:49,420
if I'm wrong and never see this.

6925
02:47:51,310 --> 02:47:54,970
So it happens in the green row in
literally the fight is six seconds long.

6926
02:48:00,370 --> 02:48:01,430
Well

6927
02:48:07,800 --> 02:48:08,633
that's it.

6928
02:48:12,470 --> 02:48:13,880
You look older.

6929
02:48:13,881 --> 02:48:15,470
There was a beard.

6930
02:48:15,590 --> 02:48:16,880
I had that full beard back then.

6931
02:48:17,090 --> 02:48:18,350
That was after Evan died.

6932
02:48:18,590 --> 02:48:19,610
Whenever Tanner died,

6933
02:48:19,611 --> 02:48:20,570
we all grew beards.

6934
02:48:20,660 --> 02:48:20,941
Ah,

6935
02:48:20,941 --> 02:48:21,220
yeah.

6936
02:48:21,220 --> 02:48:22,010
Yeah.

6937
02:48:22,010 --> 02:48:22,821
That was a bad deal,

6938
02:48:22,821 --> 02:48:23,400
man.

6939
02:48:23,400 --> 02:48:24,140
I'm sad.

6940
02:48:24,140 --> 02:48:24,710
Very bad.

6941
02:48:24,710 --> 02:48:24,951
Yeah.

6942
02:48:24,951 --> 02:48:25,641
That guy was,

6943
02:48:25,641 --> 02:48:26,180
um,

6944
02:48:26,180 --> 02:48:27,950
I think he rolled out
there into the desert.

6945
02:48:27,951 --> 02:48:28,641
It was on a mission,

6946
02:48:28,641 --> 02:48:30,260
I think might have,

6947
02:48:30,330 --> 02:48:30,940
you know,

6948
02:48:30,940 --> 02:48:34,130
I mean maybe when he was out
there he decided to go that way.

6949
02:48:34,131 --> 02:48:36,860
Or maybe you just really did get
lost and couldn't find his water.

6950
02:48:36,861 --> 02:48:38,930
But that's one of the
hottest places on earth.

6951
02:48:38,950 --> 02:48:39,350
Yeah.

6952
02:48:39,350 --> 02:48:41,160
I mean he gets to the
one thirties and stuff.

6953
02:48:41,890 --> 02:48:42,723
It's just not,

6954
02:48:42,810 --> 02:48:43,643
that was a bummer.

6955
02:48:43,790 --> 02:48:44,211
It a bummer.

6956
02:48:44,211 --> 02:48:45,020
He was a great guy.

6957
02:48:45,020 --> 02:48:46,520
He's an interesting guy too.

6958
02:48:46,580 --> 02:48:46,941
You know,

6959
02:48:46,941 --> 02:48:47,171
he was,

6960
02:48:47,171 --> 02:48:47,341
I got,

6961
02:48:47,341 --> 02:48:48,740
I really wasn't into the money.

6962
02:48:48,741 --> 02:48:49,400
Really wasn't mean.

6963
02:48:49,400 --> 02:48:52,400
He was into the journey
and difficult quite,

6964
02:48:52,401 --> 02:48:53,870
he probably would've
loved the ultra running.

6965
02:48:54,170 --> 02:48:54,440
Yeah,

6966
02:48:54,440 --> 02:48:54,801
absolutely.

6967
02:48:54,801 --> 02:48:56,000
And he fought down.

6968
02:48:56,150 --> 02:48:58,580
What was the show in Texas
that they were doing back then?

6969
02:48:58,610 --> 02:49:01,730
Cause he cut his teeth in that
circuit down there in Texas.

6970
02:49:01,731 --> 02:49:03,080
I can't remember what shows those.

6971
02:49:03,160 --> 02:49:05,780
Remember he fought checks is
fighting championship or something.

6972
02:49:05,810 --> 02:49:08,400
He was a tough motherfucker man
when he fought Dave Turrell.

6973
02:49:08,550 --> 02:49:09,383
Oh yeah.

6974
02:49:09,480 --> 02:49:11,460
I mean Dave Terrell had
them in a guillotine,

6975
02:49:11,490 --> 02:49:13,430
wouldn't tap and then he
starts smashing them and that,

6976
02:49:13,431 --> 02:49:14,940
that's how he wanted to try was talented.

6977
02:49:14,970 --> 02:49:15,421
Fuck.

6978
02:49:15,421 --> 02:49:16,140
Yay was,

6979
02:49:16,140 --> 02:49:18,930
but he was mentally like
he would fall apart.

6980
02:49:18,931 --> 02:49:19,530
Right.

6981
02:49:19,530 --> 02:49:20,820
Well he did in that fight,

6982
02:49:20,850 --> 02:49:22,470
or at least he gassed out.

6983
02:49:22,500 --> 02:49:23,040
You know what,

6984
02:49:23,040 --> 02:49:24,300
something happened in that fight.

6985
02:49:24,301 --> 02:49:24,871
But yeah,

6986
02:49:24,871 --> 02:49:28,200
that was the word is that his talent
never matched up to his performances.

6987
02:49:28,590 --> 02:49:30,180
And as a Jujitsu player though,

6988
02:49:30,181 --> 02:49:31,140
he was very,

6989
02:49:31,141 --> 02:49:32,070
very successful.

6990
02:49:32,071 --> 02:49:32,820
Like I,

6991
02:49:32,820 --> 02:49:34,410
I saw him fighting Abu Dhabi.

6992
02:49:34,411 --> 02:49:36,120
Who's a fucking [inaudible] man.

6993
02:49:36,150 --> 02:49:40,320
I mean he was phenomenal and to this day
produces some of the best black belts.

6994
02:49:40,350 --> 02:49:42,060
Who's the best grappler on the planet now?

6995
02:49:42,061 --> 02:49:42,540
You think?

6996
02:49:42,540 --> 02:49:43,470
That's a good question.

6997
02:49:44,100 --> 02:49:45,030
It's hard to tell.

6998
02:49:45,031 --> 02:49:45,271
I mean,

6999
02:49:45,271 --> 02:49:46,770
it's probably Danaher's guys.

7000
02:49:46,771 --> 02:49:47,220
Yeah,

7001
02:49:47,220 --> 02:49:47,640
yeah.

7002
02:49:47,640 --> 02:49:47,960
It's,

7003
02:49:47,960 --> 02:49:52,020
it's probably Gordon Ryan or maybe
Gary Tonin or one of those guys.

7004
02:49:52,020 --> 02:49:52,290
Right.

7005
02:49:52,290 --> 02:49:54,900
But then there's a lot of
really high level Jujitsu guys.

7006
02:49:55,080 --> 02:49:55,261
See,

7007
02:49:55,261 --> 02:49:56,520
the thing is these,

7008
02:49:56,700 --> 02:49:59,970
no one has caught up
to Donna hers leg game.

7009
02:50:00,240 --> 02:50:00,631
Like,

7010
02:50:00,631 --> 02:50:00,960
um,

7011
02:50:00,960 --> 02:50:02,340
there's a few guys,

7012
02:50:02,640 --> 02:50:03,180
um,

7013
02:50:03,180 --> 02:50:06,240
there's Craig Jones out of Australia
that's on a real high level.

7014
02:50:06,241 --> 02:50:06,570
There's,

7015
02:50:06,570 --> 02:50:09,780
there's a bunch of guys
that are closing in,

7016
02:50:09,900 --> 02:50:12,870
but it seems like what
Donna is doing and he,

7017
02:50:12,871 --> 02:50:13,100
I mean,

7018
02:50:13,100 --> 02:50:15,750
Donna her is such a fucking wizard.

7019
02:50:16,110 --> 02:50:19,650
He's such a genius in his
application of his mind,

7020
02:50:19,800 --> 02:50:19,981
you know,

7021
02:50:19,981 --> 02:50:21,780
cause Danaher's severely crippled.

7022
02:50:21,781 --> 02:50:24,030
He's got a one fake hip and they're gonna,

7023
02:50:24,060 --> 02:50:25,800
they're gonna replace one of his knees.

7024
02:50:26,280 --> 02:50:30,360
And he hurt his knee a long time
ago from a rugby accident and they,

7025
02:50:30,660 --> 02:50:32,640
his knee was so loose and fucked up,

7026
02:50:32,641 --> 02:50:36,330
but they shortened his tendons to
stitch them back together again.

7027
02:50:36,331 --> 02:50:40,290
But they shortened them too much and
he never could fully extend his leg.

7028
02:50:40,650 --> 02:50:42,330
And he was fucked up from then on out.

7029
02:50:42,331 --> 02:50:46,630
And then it's caused by a
defect in his hip because Lord,

7030
02:50:46,830 --> 02:50:47,120
yeah,

7031
02:50:47,120 --> 02:50:49,830
I wore out his hip so
he's severely injured.

7032
02:50:50,250 --> 02:50:52,230
But his mind is a genius.

7033
02:50:52,640 --> 02:50:53,700
I mean he's just very,

7034
02:50:53,701 --> 02:50:54,001
very,

7035
02:50:54,001 --> 02:50:55,110
very intelligent guy.

7036
02:50:55,130 --> 02:50:57,750
Superior intellect and his,

7037
02:50:57,840 --> 02:51:02,840
the way he's applied like that thought
process to Jujitsu is just incredibly

7038
02:51:02,941 --> 02:51:03,600
unique.

7039
02:51:03,600 --> 02:51:04,291
And so those guys,

7040
02:51:04,291 --> 02:51:05,041
Eddy Cummings,

7041
02:51:05,041 --> 02:51:05,880
Nikki Ryan,

7042
02:51:06,120 --> 02:51:06,481
Gordon,

7043
02:51:06,481 --> 02:51:07,440
Ryan like this,

7044
02:51:07,441 --> 02:51:08,231
this Donna,

7045
02:51:08,231 --> 02:51:08,971
her death squad,

7046
02:51:08,971 --> 02:51:09,750
what they call,

7047
02:51:09,750 --> 02:51:12,690
I have to think that at least
in terms of accomplishments,

7048
02:51:12,691 --> 02:51:16,080
I mean that guy submitted
a Cyborg Ricardo a brew.

7049
02:51:16,081 --> 02:51:18,180
I mean fucking easy if
you watch that fight.

7050
02:51:18,360 --> 02:51:19,620
And I had um,

7051
02:51:19,800 --> 02:51:23,040
John Danaher on the podcast
breakdown what he did to Cyborg.

7052
02:51:23,130 --> 02:51:27,270
Cyborg is a multiple time world champion
and Gordon Ryan went right through him

7053
02:51:27,271 --> 02:51:28,740
and Gordon Ryan 22 years old.

7054
02:51:28,790 --> 02:51:29,190
Yeah,

7055
02:51:29,190 --> 02:51:30,390
I think somewhere around there.

7056
02:51:31,500 --> 02:51:32,101
I look at it.

7057
02:51:32,101 --> 02:51:32,730
Good,

7058
02:51:32,730 --> 02:51:33,071
great.

7059
02:51:33,071 --> 02:51:36,550
Grapplers throughout history
from back the early Gracie's,

7060
02:51:36,551 --> 02:51:36,731
you know,

7061
02:51:36,731 --> 02:51:37,750
the foreign law burns,

7062
02:51:37,751 --> 02:51:39,370
all these scary dudes and stuff.

7063
02:51:39,371 --> 02:51:43,570
And as it moves forward in time
and just watching guys how they,

7064
02:51:44,170 --> 02:51:46,630
it's almost like a constant cyclical,

7065
02:51:46,840 --> 02:51:49,000
there's a cycle there of you.

7066
02:51:49,030 --> 02:51:50,530
You learn how to defend stuff,

7067
02:51:50,560 --> 02:51:51,281
you hit stuff,

7068
02:51:51,281 --> 02:51:52,930
people learn how to
defend it and you move on.

7069
02:51:52,931 --> 02:51:57,010
And it's this constant cycle of it and
the new shit coming out and creative

7070
02:51:57,011 --> 02:51:57,401
stuff.

7071
02:51:57,401 --> 02:51:59,470
And I just watch it evolve and go,

7072
02:51:59,471 --> 02:51:59,711
man,

7073
02:51:59,711 --> 02:52:00,130
I just,

7074
02:52:00,130 --> 02:52:02,420
I wish I could stay young
forever just along with it.

7075
02:52:02,440 --> 02:52:03,020
You know what I mean?

7076
02:52:03,020 --> 02:52:03,641
With your body.

7077
02:52:03,641 --> 02:52:03,941
Yeah.

7078
02:52:03,941 --> 02:52:04,191
It's,

7079
02:52:04,191 --> 02:52:06,340
it's an unfortunate thing that your mind,

7080
02:52:06,390 --> 02:52:10,240
he absorbs all these techniques and
you understand how to compete better,

7081
02:52:10,390 --> 02:52:11,500
but your body just gives out.

7082
02:52:11,501 --> 02:52:11,920
Right.

7083
02:52:11,920 --> 02:52:13,660
And that's the thing
with the MMA especially,

7084
02:52:13,990 --> 02:52:18,850
I think it's a race to amass enough
knowledge to one a title before the body

7085
02:52:18,851 --> 02:52:19,210
gives out.

7086
02:52:19,210 --> 02:52:19,650
Right,

7087
02:52:19,650 --> 02:52:20,483
right.

7088
02:52:20,860 --> 02:52:22,840
Well that's why TRT was so interesting,

7089
02:52:23,090 --> 02:52:23,281
you know,

7090
02:52:23,281 --> 02:52:27,700
like the TRT v toward days because
you had v toward choose to the tits.

7091
02:52:28,210 --> 02:52:30,160
And with all that experience,

7092
02:52:30,161 --> 02:52:30,461
I mean,

7093
02:52:30,461 --> 02:52:35,020
veto made his UFC debut back when I called
my first fight and it was when I was

7094
02:52:35,021 --> 02:52:39,340
a post fight interview or rather UFC 12
that was his debut at 19 years of age.

7095
02:52:39,610 --> 02:52:44,610
So here you had him at 37 juiced out
of his fucking mind with muscles on his

7096
02:52:44,921 --> 02:52:45,754
eyebrows.

7097
02:52:46,030 --> 02:52:51,030
I mean he was so jacked when he fought
Rockhold when he fight Bisbing I mean

7098
02:52:52,240 --> 02:52:55,960
clearly he was not just taking
testosterone replacement therapy.

7099
02:52:56,170 --> 02:52:57,190
He was juiced up.

7100
02:52:57,430 --> 02:53:00,250
I mean he was way above normal levels.

7101
02:53:00,310 --> 02:53:01,900
I remember UFC Brazil,

7102
02:53:01,901 --> 02:53:05,100
I was fighting Vandelay and veto.

7103
02:53:05,101 --> 02:53:05,921
We're fighting each other.

7104
02:53:05,921 --> 02:53:06,550
Yeah.

7105
02:53:06,550 --> 02:53:06,940
Right.

7106
02:53:06,940 --> 02:53:08,260
And you knew that was a collision.

7107
02:53:08,320 --> 02:53:08,801
Yeah,

7108
02:53:08,801 --> 02:53:09,910
that was too scary dudes.

7109
02:53:10,390 --> 02:53:11,920
If he told her shoes for that fight.

7110
02:53:12,280 --> 02:53:13,360
But here's the crazy thing,

7111
02:53:13,480 --> 02:53:18,370
I'm in my locker room and I'm getting
ready to fight and one of the tours

7112
02:53:18,371 --> 02:53:19,910
trainers comes in via tore,

7113
02:53:19,911 --> 02:53:22,480
sent them to get me to
come give him a pep talk.

7114
02:53:22,690 --> 02:53:23,523
Whoa.

7115
02:53:23,590 --> 02:53:26,740
That was the fight when he
had hid for like three days.

7116
02:53:27,250 --> 02:53:28,390
Cause he was terrified.

7117
02:53:28,510 --> 02:53:29,760
Fatty Lou was so scary.

7118
02:53:29,810 --> 02:53:30,460
He was having,

7119
02:53:30,460 --> 02:53:33,160
he was having just this I
think a mental breakdown,

7120
02:53:33,670 --> 02:53:34,040
uh,

7121
02:53:34,040 --> 02:53:37,690
an anxiety attack about fighting veto
or about fighting Vandelay Silva.

7122
02:53:38,350 --> 02:53:41,980
So he's in his locker room
and he's sitting in the
corner and he was light with

7123
02:53:41,981 --> 02:53:42,701
his eyes big.

7124
02:53:42,701 --> 02:53:43,600
He's scared to death.

7125
02:53:44,020 --> 02:53:45,190
And I walked in there and I'm like,

7126
02:53:45,580 --> 02:53:46,413
dude,

7127
02:53:46,450 --> 02:53:46,871
fucking,

7128
02:53:46,871 --> 02:53:47,980
we're fighting for world titles.

7129
02:53:48,200 --> 02:53:49,120
What are you do it?

7130
02:53:49,150 --> 02:53:50,050
What is wrong with you?

7131
02:53:50,051 --> 02:53:50,884
Let's fucking go,

7132
02:53:50,900 --> 02:53:53,350
let's fuck a Kelly's guys
are getting all pumped up.

7133
02:53:53,351 --> 02:53:53,681
And he's like,

7134
02:53:53,681 --> 02:53:54,514
all right.

7135
02:53:56,350 --> 02:53:58,810
Well he had gotten beaten
down by Randy before that.

7136
02:53:59,200 --> 02:54:00,560
That fight took a lot out of it.

7137
02:54:00,700 --> 02:54:04,720
He wasn't the same guy for a long time
after that for the most brutal fight I've

7138
02:54:04,721 --> 02:54:05,411
ever seen in my life.

7139
02:54:05,411 --> 02:54:07,870
That was Amerigo [inaudible] and Don Frye.

7140
02:54:08,200 --> 02:54:11,260
I remember that in Cobo
Arena in Detroit too big.

7141
02:54:11,290 --> 02:54:12,940
It was way too strong.

7142
02:54:12,970 --> 02:54:16,460
It was horrifying because
Omri had shot on him and

7143
02:54:18,160 --> 02:54:19,150
he's walking his feet,

7144
02:54:19,151 --> 02:54:19,601
Don fries,

7145
02:54:19,601 --> 02:54:23,410
walking his feet up the cage and drop a
knee straight down on Baca armories head

7146
02:54:23,620 --> 02:54:24,420
when those were legal.

7147
02:54:24,420 --> 02:54:25,120
Yup.

7148
02:54:25,120 --> 02:54:26,680
And the entire crowd is roaring.

7149
02:54:26,681 --> 02:54:27,600
Kobo arenas pack,

7150
02:54:27,610 --> 02:54:28,330
they're going nuts.

7151
02:54:28,330 --> 02:54:30,580
And all you can hear over
the top of everything is,

7152
02:54:30,890 --> 02:54:31,723
um,

7153
02:54:32,440 --> 02:54:32,920
is,

7154
02:54:32,920 --> 02:54:35,320
is armories girlfriend's
screaming bloody murder.

7155
02:54:35,580 --> 02:54:36,060
Like,

7156
02:54:36,060 --> 02:54:38,020
like someone was being
slaughtered in front of her,

7157
02:54:38,110 --> 02:54:38,870
which they were.

7158
02:54:38,870 --> 02:54:39,703
Right.

7159
02:54:39,730 --> 02:54:41,440
And then you've got as Valdo Alvarez,

7160
02:54:41,441 --> 02:54:43,420
who's an encyclopedia
of Brazilian Jujitsu,

7161
02:54:43,480 --> 02:54:47,410
amazing guy and Alan Gomes and Alan Go.

7162
02:54:47,410 --> 02:54:50,590
As I had been up there all week to
help Omri get ready for the fight,

7163
02:54:50,591 --> 02:54:51,424
right.

7164
02:54:51,580 --> 02:54:52,450
And Alan go,

7165
02:54:52,451 --> 02:54:54,100
it shows up the day of the fight,

7166
02:54:54,430 --> 02:54:57,280
the night of the fight walks
into the locker room and goes,

7167
02:54:57,760 --> 02:54:58,593
what's your name?

7168
02:54:58,900 --> 02:54:59,733
I'm going to go pat.

7169
02:54:59,830 --> 02:55:00,370
And he goes,

7170
02:55:00,370 --> 02:55:01,060
here's a camera.

7171
02:55:01,060 --> 02:55:01,990
Take fucking pictures.

7172
02:55:03,500 --> 02:55:04,370
That's the way Alan taught,

7173
02:55:04,580 --> 02:55:05,810
treated me when we first met.

7174
02:55:05,811 --> 02:55:05,990
Right.

7175
02:55:05,990 --> 02:55:06,823
Wow.

7176
02:55:07,040 --> 02:55:12,040
So I'm watching Omri get mall
just completely slaughtered
and these guys won't

7177
02:55:12,761 --> 02:55:13,610
throw in the towel.

7178
02:55:14,240 --> 02:55:14,811
And I'm going,

7179
02:55:14,811 --> 02:55:16,370
you got to throw in like,

7180
02:55:16,520 --> 02:55:17,240
yeah,

7181
02:55:17,240 --> 02:55:18,073
you can say this,

7182
02:55:18,460 --> 02:55:19,293
this is stupid.

7183
02:55:19,360 --> 02:55:20,193
This is stupid.

7184
02:55:20,480 --> 02:55:21,830
And John had stopped the fight.

7185
02:55:21,950 --> 02:55:23,720
Mccarthy pull him over and he'd go,

7186
02:55:23,721 --> 02:55:25,660
do you want to continue all I'm renewing.

7187
02:55:25,670 --> 02:55:27,680
English was more more.

7188
02:55:28,430 --> 02:55:28,800
And he's like,

7189
02:55:28,800 --> 02:55:29,240
all right,

7190
02:55:29,240 --> 02:55:30,140
we're going again.

7191
02:55:30,500 --> 02:55:31,640
And he'd get slaughtered some more,

7192
02:55:31,641 --> 02:55:32,480
pulling back off,

7193
02:55:32,810 --> 02:55:33,530
more,

7194
02:55:33,530 --> 02:55:34,970
more sending it back out.

7195
02:55:34,971 --> 02:55:35,781
And finally John's like,

7196
02:55:35,781 --> 02:55:36,560
I got this.

7197
02:55:36,560 --> 02:55:38,460
We're going to have a
fatality or the seasons.

7198
02:55:38,520 --> 02:55:40,040
So that was horrifying fight.

7199
02:55:40,041 --> 02:55:41,370
That was the most brutal
fight I've ever seen.

7200
02:55:41,950 --> 02:55:42,140
Yeah,

7201
02:55:42,140 --> 02:55:43,970
there's been a few of
those over the years.

7202
02:55:46,010 --> 02:55:47,150
It's been a few of those.

7203
02:55:47,810 --> 02:55:48,620
Well listen pat,

7204
02:55:48,620 --> 02:55:49,850
we just did three hours,

7205
02:55:49,970 --> 02:55:50,920
three hours plus.

7206
02:55:50,921 --> 02:55:51,270
Holy Cow.

7207
02:55:51,270 --> 02:55:52,370
Time flies by man.

7208
02:55:52,560 --> 02:55:53,660
I'm glad we finally did this.

7209
02:55:53,661 --> 02:55:55,140
I'm surprised my attention span lasts.

7210
02:55:55,230 --> 02:55:56,660
He would teach his feds on point,

7211
02:55:56,661 --> 02:55:57,160
man.

7212
02:55:57,160 --> 02:55:58,510
It's all that ultra marathon runner.

7213
02:55:58,520 --> 02:55:58,701
Right,

7214
02:55:58,701 --> 02:55:59,060
right.

7215
02:55:59,060 --> 02:56:00,170
We got to do this again man.

7216
02:56:00,200 --> 02:56:01,010
I looked at it.

7217
02:56:01,010 --> 02:56:03,290
