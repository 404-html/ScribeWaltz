1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:03,030
There's no season 10 was the best.

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:03,510
Here we go.

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:04,343
We're to live.

4
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:05,141
Don't say anything.

5
00:00:05,141 --> 00:00:05,974
Don't say anything,

6
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:12,940
right.

7
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:13,900
Welcome to fight companion.

8
00:00:13,901 --> 00:00:16,450
If you never heard one
of these podcasts before,

9
00:00:16,451 --> 00:00:18,100
this is not a normal podcast,

10
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:19,780
but sometimes it becomes a normal podcast.

11
00:00:19,781 --> 00:00:20,890
So take a chance,

12
00:00:20,891 --> 00:00:21,724
bitch.

13
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,040
Brendan shops in the motherfucking
house and my brother Eddie Bravo,

14
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,630
and of course,

15
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:30,760
and we're watching the fights.

16
00:00:30,761 --> 00:00:32,680
This is fight night live from Japan.

17
00:00:32,681 --> 00:00:33,514
It's um,

18
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,880
Josh Barnett versus big country.

19
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:37,780
Roy Nelson.

20
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:38,771
That's the main event.

21
00:00:38,771 --> 00:00:40,120
Uriah hall versus Musashi.

22
00:00:40,121 --> 00:00:41,850
That's a fight I really want
to say that's tonight too.

23
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:42,970
That's a big fucking fight.

24
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:43,870
That's a juicy one.

25
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:46,063
It's a big one,

26
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:47,130
a huge one for you.

27
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:50,620
And it's a big chance for Moose
saucy when he has to take a chance.

28
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:51,550
Musafa.

29
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:52,720
He's given them a shot.

30
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:54,131
He's given them a shot.

31
00:00:54,131 --> 00:00:56,590
I think if you're Ryan Hall shows up.

32
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:59,980
That's Uriah Hall is best
moments inside the octagon.

33
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,390
Like Uriah Hall,

34
00:01:01,391 --> 00:01:04,680
I think when he's sharp is one
of the fastest fucking one.

35
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,010
One,

36
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:05,990
185 pounds.

37
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:06,880
He's a monster.

38
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,470
He's so athletic.

39
00:01:08,471 --> 00:01:11,020
You know what wouldn't
take one of them the most?

40
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:11,680
To me,

41
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,230
the biggest curiosities about that
dude's when he broke his foot,

42
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:16,000
fucked it up real bad.

43
00:01:16,001 --> 00:01:18,340
Like you could look
down in between rounds.

44
00:01:18,341 --> 00:01:19,180
We're looking at his toe.

45
00:01:19,181 --> 00:01:20,260
His Toe was Jack.

46
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:21,820
The bone was sticking out of it.

47
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:23,230
Hobbles back to his corner.

48
00:01:23,231 --> 00:01:24,580
Then the bell starts the next round.

49
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:25,840
He's throwing kicks with it.

50
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:29,320
He's throwing kicks with it and he's
moving around like he doesn't feel fucking

51
00:01:29,321 --> 00:01:29,770
thing.

52
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:33,130
And then as soon as the rounds
over that mean that he's wobbling,

53
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,630
it'd be barely walk at
the end of the fight.

54
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:37,750
That takes some serious
mental toughness for sure.

55
00:01:37,751 --> 00:01:39,730
Which is your eyes biggest knock,

56
00:01:39,731 --> 00:01:39,971
right?

57
00:01:39,971 --> 00:01:40,530
His mental.

58
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:41,160
Exactly.

59
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,850
I trained with the guy for a year.

60
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,690
What do you think?

61
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:45,250
He's a athletically.

62
00:01:45,251 --> 00:01:46,720
He's the biggest freak.

63
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:47,800
He's his own worst enemy.

64
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:48,110
If,

65
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:48,943
if the.

66
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,263
If the.

67
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:53,830
If the hall shows up with
the right mind frame.

68
00:01:53,831 --> 00:01:54,340
Yeah man,

69
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:54,640
he's.

70
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,780
He's one of the best in the world.

71
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,610
That's a big fucking f.

72
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,510
and guess what?

73
00:01:58,510 --> 00:01:59,740
Moussaka is five guys,

74
00:01:59,741 --> 00:02:00,790
just like you're at home.

75
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:02,050
He's beat Osp.

76
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:02,771
Hector,

77
00:02:02,771 --> 00:02:03,221
Lumbar,

78
00:02:03,221 --> 00:02:04,490
back in the day holding flat,

79
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:07,480
big disclosive bank Osp has mad potential,

80
00:02:07,481 --> 00:02:08,121
don't get me wrong,

81
00:02:08,121 --> 00:02:09,790
and I think he gets better
every time he fights.

82
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:12,280
Like the shogun knockout
was a big fucking deal.

83
00:02:12,281 --> 00:02:13,540
I was super shocked by that.

84
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,000
The Pack Cummins knock on.

85
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:15,341
I was like,

86
00:02:15,341 --> 00:02:16,080
whoa.

87
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,880
OSP is getting better every
single time we see him,

88
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:23,080
but like it would come to
the execution of techniques.

89
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:26,680
There's just some shit that uriah
hall can do that Osp can't quite do.

90
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:27,400
I didn't see,

91
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,790
but those will be shielded off
against world class competition.

92
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:32,990
Hasn't beat any ebo right?

93
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,220
No.

94
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,470
You're hunting kind of c level guys.

95
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,340
You're 100 percent.

96
00:02:36,341 --> 00:02:36,740
Right.

97
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,573
And that was my,

98
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:40,840
my kind of original point
was that Uriah Hall,

99
00:02:40,841 --> 00:02:43,090
like his movement inside the octagon,

100
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,520
like when he's sharp as he can be,

101
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,410
he can do some freaky shit.

102
00:02:47,411 --> 00:02:47,980
One hundred percent.

103
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:48,490
He can.

104
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:51,130
You see that Ron stallings fight
when you get that right hand,

105
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:55,070
right hand is a God damn late
Matrix Shit Matrix shift,

106
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,840
right?

107
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,760
It's just a matter of stringing together
those moments when it's crucial and OSP

108
00:03:00,761 --> 00:03:02,890
has definitely been able
to do that more than him.

109
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,160
Yes,

110
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:03,993
100 percent,

111
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:05,123
100 percent,

112
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:08,550
but when it becomes too like
those spectacular movements
that Uriah Hall dues,

113
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,620
when I see Osp,

114
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:11,410
I see a super strong,

115
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:15,760
really tough guy who obviously works real
hard and is better every time you see

116
00:03:15,761 --> 00:03:16,121
him fight,

117
00:03:16,121 --> 00:03:16,600
right?

118
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,280
Like those fucking power left kicks.

119
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:21,450
He throws a crazy athlete and he's.

120
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,590
He's got total world
championship potential.

121
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:27,520
If that guy keeps accelerating at the
pace he's at now you can see Osp at a

122
00:03:27,521 --> 00:03:28,870
world championship level in a year,

123
00:03:28,871 --> 00:03:29,710
maybe even two years.

124
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,190
True.

125
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,023
One hundred percent,

126
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,920
but what you're Ryan Hall does,

127
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,720
he does that every now and then.

128
00:03:34,721 --> 00:03:36,850
You get these bursts of
that next level shit.

129
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,140
You get these bursts of that.

130
00:03:38,141 --> 00:03:38,801
Ron stallings,

131
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:39,880
righthand the we'll kick that.

132
00:03:39,881 --> 00:03:42,010
He knocked that kid
out on tough and again,

133
00:03:42,011 --> 00:03:45,430
he's not fighting this the highest level
of competition when he's pulling these

134
00:03:45,431 --> 00:03:46,061
techniques off,

135
00:03:46,061 --> 00:03:47,380
but they're there for.

136
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:48,400
They're there but not,

137
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,690
but he just hasn't done it.

138
00:03:49,691 --> 00:03:50,140
Like you said,

139
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,610
against a high level guy.

140
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:54,120
Then when he started pulling that shit
like people that shit off tonight against

141
00:03:54,121 --> 00:03:54,950
them saucy,

142
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:56,980
like most aussies kind of seen this man.

143
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,170
He's like,

144
00:03:58,450 --> 00:03:59,860
he's made some good good.

145
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:00,630
Certainly.

146
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:03,210
It certainly has with Musashi.

147
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:03,820
He just.

148
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,810
I don't know what it is.

149
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:07,870
He just fucking good
tight muscles in his mind,

150
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:08,783
Bro.

151
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:09,871
Bro.

152
00:04:09,871 --> 00:04:13,130
Is it 10th planet now your aisle?

153
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:14,680
P O.

154
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:14,680
S.

155
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,513
P is

156
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:19,703
at double or nothing.

157
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:24,750
I own a thousand from the
last fight and a running tab.

158
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:28,170
Definitely better this way.

159
00:04:28,171 --> 00:04:31,670
Nobody ever asked to really like
get hurt and pay someone $10,000.

160
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:34,090
200,000 dollars.

161
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:38,410
You got to suck his dick for $100,000.

162
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:39,743
Thousand Dollars.

163
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,850
If you would just clear clean my bed out.

164
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,270
I'm not saying I would do it,

165
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:50,690
but you would have to sit
down with your friends.

166
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,920
Have to talk to my wife about it.

167
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:59,500
I have to imagine how gay Brenda would
have to be to let you this check for 100

168
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:00,443
grand

169
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,290
just to get the pictures to suck his dick.

170
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:06,620
He wouldn't do it for,

171
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:07,381
for being gay.

172
00:05:07,381 --> 00:05:09,060
He would do it to get
the fucking pictures.

173
00:05:09,061 --> 00:05:09,894
Man,

174
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:15,180
you would have those pictures
are already out there,

175
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:23,240
but you'd be open to it

176
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:26,970
if anybody knows how to suck your Dick.

177
00:05:26,971 --> 00:05:27,181
Right.

178
00:05:27,181 --> 00:05:29,470
It's a girl photo.

179
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,110
Photoshop your face,

180
00:05:31,111 --> 00:05:31,570
Joe.

181
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:32,171
Like really,

182
00:05:32,171 --> 00:05:35,170
really good on some dude
blowing another dude.

183
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,543
Oh for sure.

184
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,200
The golden rule.

185
00:05:38,201 --> 00:05:38,950
The Internet.

186
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,150
If there's a picture of you out there,

187
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,460
someone somewhere has photoshop
with Dick in your mouth.

188
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:48,340
Otherwise you ain't doing shit on
my own website of and my website.

189
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:48,970
Nice.

190
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:50,560
This dude named [inaudible] from England,

191
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,680
but we did 100 floppy,

192
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,560
hilarious.

193
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,710
Who had the most hilarious.

194
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:57,980
Oh

195
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:58,291
my God.

196
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:58,881
And it was me.

197
00:05:58,881 --> 00:06:01,160
They always involve like 100 black dicks.

198
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:04,250
I could have 50 arms
and shit is ridiculous.

199
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:04,961
They're funny.

200
00:06:04,961 --> 00:06:05,794
His helmet,

201
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:07,100
his,

202
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:07,401
his.

203
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:08,001
He's always done.

204
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:09,440
It was like a funny sense of humor,

205
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:14,390
but some people can do it and they can
get so close that girls get really mad

206
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:17,630
because like famous actresses
have been like in porn scenes,

207
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,530
they just put their body in,

208
00:06:19,531 --> 00:06:19,780
you know,

209
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:20,690
they more for girls.

210
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:21,861
So good.

211
00:06:21,861 --> 00:06:23,360
You can do anything now with that stuff.

212
00:06:23,361 --> 00:06:24,290
With photo editing,

213
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:26,540
they can literally have
you wrestling a dinosaur.

214
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:26,991
All their needs.

215
00:06:26,991 --> 00:06:29,780
You're faced anything
from game of thrones.

216
00:06:29,781 --> 00:06:31,310
When they made her walk
through the city naked,

217
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,930
turns out it wasn't her body.

218
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:33,800
Right.

219
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,161
Wow.

220
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:34,994
Is that true?

221
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:35,903
Is the body.

222
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,280
That's what Red Band set?

223
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,240
I don't know if that's true.

224
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:38,961
Well,

225
00:06:38,961 --> 00:06:39,794
he would probably know.

226
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,880
I think it is true.

227
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:43,580
I mean it makes sense to watch that shit.

228
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,680
Was that chick I was probably be like,

229
00:06:45,681 --> 00:06:45,980
look,

230
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:46,940
you can make a dragon.

231
00:06:46,941 --> 00:06:47,930
You can't give me fake tits.

232
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:48,913
I agree.

233
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,480
Why do you have to see my real teeth?

234
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,170
That's creepy.

235
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:52,660
I don't want you to stare into my asshole.

236
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:53,690
I walked on the street.

237
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:57,710
She was totally naked and
you got like a hundred,

238
00:06:57,711 --> 00:07:01,250
200 people that are working as extras
that are the slaves and the peasants

239
00:07:01,251 --> 00:07:01,700
people.

240
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,990
So they're all going to see her naked too.

241
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,033
That's not fun.

242
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:04,810
Yeah.

243
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:06,260
You see her ass all and she's like,

244
00:07:06,261 --> 00:07:07,340
bear crawling through the city.

245
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,290
I've been naked in a couple of things.

246
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,370
I was naked in this,

247
00:07:10,371 --> 00:07:10,640
uh,

248
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,710
thing that I did for a news radio once.

249
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:16,580
I had to be naked in front of the whole
idea was like I was waiting for this

250
00:07:16,581 --> 00:07:19,350
chick in her apartment and uh,

251
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:19,680
uh,

252
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,511
I was trying to,

253
00:07:20,511 --> 00:07:21,344
uh,

254
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:22,640
I forget the whole premise.

255
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,100
I guess I was trying to get her
to date me or something like that.

256
00:07:25,101 --> 00:07:26,140
So I lit a bunch of candles.

257
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:27,140
I took my clothes off.

258
00:07:27,141 --> 00:07:28,400
Do they pay extra for that or no?

259
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,070
I don't.

260
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:29,490
No,

261
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,323
I think so.

262
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,740
Do you have something over your junk and
no knowledge of my Dick was hanging out

263
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,080
and when she came in I covered it up.

264
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,070
I had to cover it up.

265
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:38,750
Like that was the scene of the movie.

266
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:38,931
Like,

267
00:07:38,931 --> 00:07:39,171
Whoa,

268
00:07:39,171 --> 00:07:41,030
it's you or I forget the premise.

269
00:07:41,031 --> 00:07:42,620
It was on news radio was long time ago.

270
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,330
It was not uncomfortable for sure.

271
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:44,781
Yeah.

272
00:07:44,781 --> 00:07:48,770
And then there was another one that
I did for the vh one fashion awards.

273
00:07:48,771 --> 00:07:49,970
It was like 1997.

274
00:07:49,971 --> 00:07:53,720
I did this thing where I played this
photographer that was crazy and he,

275
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,010
I didn't know anything about photography.

276
00:07:55,011 --> 00:07:56,360
I was just to try to get laid.

277
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:57,500
That was the whole thing.

278
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,220
And uh,

279
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,450
I would say to the girl,

280
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,710
do you have any problems with nudity?

281
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,131
And she goes,

282
00:08:01,131 --> 00:08:01,640
no,

283
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,271
and next thing you know,

284
00:08:02,271 --> 00:08:03,740
I'm taking pictures of her while naked.

285
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:05,240
So I had to be naked in front of her.

286
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:06,890
That was European.

287
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,330
She didn't get back in the day.

288
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:09,171
Back in the day,

289
00:08:09,171 --> 00:08:09,560
dude,

290
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,400
I was seven.

291
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,660
I was in line behind Tony to suits.

292
00:08:12,661 --> 00:08:13,494
I remember that guy.

293
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:16,250
That guy's a wild man for from Peru,

294
00:08:16,251 --> 00:08:18,680
Brazilian Jujitsu and a neck tie.

295
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,580
He didn't exactly.

296
00:08:19,581 --> 00:08:21,740
He did a 2003 Abu Dhabi.

297
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:23,090
And when we were weighing in,

298
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:27,290
I killed myself to get down to 1:45 and
I'm in line and he's in front of me and

299
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,680
we both got our underwear on.

300
00:08:28,681 --> 00:08:30,140
And you see the Japanese
press right there.

301
00:08:30,141 --> 00:08:31,510
You see Brazilian press holy,

302
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:34,370
the Gracie sitting down where
I'm waiting to weigh in.

303
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:35,360
Tony goes first,

304
00:08:35,361 --> 00:08:36,950
he drops his under what gets naked.

305
00:08:36,951 --> 00:08:37,880
No one says shit.

306
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:38,961
He gets naked,

307
00:08:38,961 --> 00:08:39,980
he weighs any makes way.

308
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,220
And then I come in and
I was so close I got,

309
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:43,400
I guess it's cool to get naked.

310
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:44,510
I pulled down

311
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:51,410
and the Japanese press come up quick
and start taking pictures of your Dick,

312
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:52,671
me naked,

313
00:08:52,671 --> 00:08:53,450
standing there naked.

314
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,260
So I started doing comfortable
poses and like most

315
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,660
of most muscular poses,

316
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,580
one post I then I went like this,

317
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:00,070
you know.

318
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:04,230
Then I did the opposite of the incredible
hulk and I got all a submissive and

319
00:09:04,231 --> 00:09:05,041
just covered my balls.

320
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:06,440
Like I was really shy and it got.

321
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:07,800
That's the picture they use.

322
00:09:07,801 --> 00:09:10,250
They put that Shit on magazine.

323
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:11,630
I'm like,

324
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:13,440
Joe,

325
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,510
is there anything that could
pay you now to do that?

326
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:18,180
To get naked and film some shit on TV?

327
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,640
I just thought he just passed.

328
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,280
It's not that big a deal.

329
00:09:21,281 --> 00:09:21,600
Like what?

330
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,470
What's the big deal?

331
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:27,500
You're someone sees your Dick people
that were so crazy about your body.

332
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:29,520
But if someone was like,

333
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:34,240
oh Joe went on TV music awards
and wants you to be on stage.

334
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:35,251
No,

335
00:09:35,251 --> 00:09:37,980
I don't think that would be something
I'd be into doing and pass the seems very

336
00:09:37,981 --> 00:09:38,814
embarrassing.

337
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:42,780
But the idea behind it is that there's
something wrong with you being naked,

338
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:43,231
you know,

339
00:09:43,231 --> 00:09:43,710
and like that.

340
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:45,280
We don't know that we all.

341
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:45,601
I mean,

342
00:09:45,601 --> 00:09:46,590
look at this crowd of people,

343
00:09:46,591 --> 00:09:47,130
right?

344
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:48,240
You Watch these two dudes fight.

345
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:49,230
We don't even know who they are.

346
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:50,230
You Watch these two.

347
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:52,500
Does a good scrap actually had
his humbly just got dropped.

348
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,620
Look at all those people in the audience
and you'll notice they all have clothes

349
00:09:55,621 --> 00:09:56,010
on.

350
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:56,221
I mean,

351
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:57,240
it's kind of ridiculous.

352
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,680
Clothes are kind of ridiculous.

353
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,270
You just want everyone to be naked.

354
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:00,840
No,

355
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,820
but this,

356
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,700
this idea that we've
created this outer wear,

357
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:08,460
like some sort of a fucking
weird homemade hermit crab thing.

358
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,320
We've created this outer shell that we
must have on except in the most intimate

359
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:14,154
moments.

360
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:16,830
I mean there's something almost.

361
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:22,770
There's almost something where the human
race realized how sexual and fucking

362
00:10:22,771 --> 00:10:23,730
crazy it is and like,

363
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:23,910
look,

364
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:27,240
the only way we're going to get anything
done is if we invent close cover shit

365
00:10:27,241 --> 00:10:27,480
up.

366
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,400
We just can't have people just fucking.

367
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:30,780
Every time they run into each other,

368
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,900
first husband just cover up their
checks or make that makes sense.

369
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:37,351
Well,

370
00:10:37,351 --> 00:10:39,660
if you look at the oldest
civilizations on earth,

371
00:10:39,661 --> 00:10:40,381
it's the Middle East,

372
00:10:40,381 --> 00:10:40,840
right?

373
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,820
And aren't those the ones who
cover the women up the most?

374
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:44,303
I

375
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:49,920
ever have to deal with
jealousy or possessiveness.

376
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,150
Mad Genius.

377
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,100
Like $50,

378
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:59,230
billion dollars,

379
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:00,061
you know,

380
00:11:00,061 --> 00:11:00,960
that's the least they could do.

381
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,400
You don't know what you're getting though.

382
00:11:02,401 --> 00:11:02,881
You know what I'm saying?

383
00:11:02,881 --> 00:11:04,700
It's like a cracker Jack.

384
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:10,510
There was like a loyalty guy that was
arrested in La for sexual assault.

385
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,620
Some woman came screaming
out of his place.

386
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,930
She was like half naked
or something like that.

387
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,250
Really?

388
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,620
That he was arrested and he,

389
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:21,690
he doesn't have immunity and it's a one
of a series of events that have happened

390
00:11:21,691 --> 00:11:26,691
with like really rich people from the
Middle East in Beverly Hills over the last

391
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,330
couple of weeks.

392
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:30,000
Because the other one that
happened was there was a race.

393
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:32,550
I don't know if I talked
about it with you now with me.

394
00:11:32,551 --> 00:11:32,970
We went to,

395
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:33,990
we went to Disneyland.

396
00:11:33,991 --> 00:11:37,560
They have this thing called Saudi summer
and in the summer in Saudi Arabia,

397
00:11:37,561 --> 00:11:40,230
it's apparently it's
unfucking God the hot.

398
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:45,330
So a lot of people come over from Saudi
Arabia to la and they buy these crazy

399
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,680
powerhouses in beverly hills.

400
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,110
And they bring over these cars
that he's multimillion dollar cars,

401
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:50,790
like a blue gotti.

402
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:53,980
They run like a one and a half
million dollar and they have

403
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:55,330
Arab license plates on them.

404
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,560
They don't even have like,

405
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:59,080
it's not even a registered
car in America that could.

406
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,020
They bring them over here in.

407
00:12:00,021 --> 00:12:01,030
They're allowed to drive them around.

408
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:04,540
And so they're driving these cars around
and they're racing through the streets

409
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,280
of Beverly Hills and they get video of it.

410
00:12:06,281 --> 00:12:09,640
People get video of these people in
million dollar cars running red lights.

411
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:10,900
This guy in a porsche gt,

412
00:12:10,901 --> 00:12:11,651
three is chasing them,

413
00:12:11,651 --> 00:12:14,410
runs a red light or runs a stop sign.

414
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,000
It's fucking crazy to watch.

415
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,200
So there's wild and out out.

416
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:18,100
These people are at,

417
00:12:18,101 --> 00:12:19,900
there's other people at the intersection.

418
00:12:19,901 --> 00:12:24,730
These guys are flying through the stop
sign with a Porsche Jesus in Beverly

419
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:25,030
Hills.

420
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:29,710
And so that was the cars pulling in the
Ferrari smoking and all these people are

421
00:12:29,711 --> 00:12:30,760
taking videos on people.

422
00:12:30,761 --> 00:12:33,130
Like the whole neighborhood is out
and they all have their iphones.

423
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,810
They're video taping it in the street.

424
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:35,980
So that happens.

425
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,270
And then right after that happened,

426
00:12:37,271 --> 00:12:38,170
this incident happened.

427
00:12:38,171 --> 00:12:41,380
So apparently a lot of these people like
they're asking for diplomatic immunity

428
00:12:41,381 --> 00:12:43,600
because they're rich and man,

429
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:44,680
but isn't that amazing?

430
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:45,514
I can't do that.

431
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:45,941
Well,

432
00:12:45,941 --> 00:12:46,570
this is.

433
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:47,920
This is what they're saying.

434
00:12:47,921 --> 00:12:48,400
Like some,

435
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,260
some of these people that do
things like that over here,

436
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:54,070
you can't prosecute them because they
have something called diplomatic immunity.

437
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,180
That's insane.

438
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:56,260
What does that mean?

439
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:01,240
That means is they have a lot of
dirt on the people running the ship.

440
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:04,420
We're going to come over and do whatever
the fuck we want to do more of what

441
00:13:04,421 --> 00:13:07,810
kind of talk and more importantly
they make a fuck load of money.

442
00:13:07,811 --> 00:13:07,941
Shit,

443
00:13:07,941 --> 00:13:08,521
load of money.

444
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:08,850
Yeah.

445
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:09,640
Every day,

446
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,470
all day.

447
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:11,200
Every day.

448
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:11,591
Dude,

449
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:12,424
look at this.

450
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:13,631
Yeah,

451
00:13:13,631 --> 00:13:13,990
this is.

452
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:14,291
These got.

453
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:14,840
Watch this,

454
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,360
the yellow card to watch the Porsche.

455
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:16,990
Look at this.

456
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:18,280
The guy doesn't even stop.

457
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,380
There's cars to the left and to the right.

458
00:13:20,381 --> 00:13:22,540
That guy just blows
through this neighborhood.

459
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:22,991
Hey Man,

460
00:13:22,991 --> 00:13:23,801
not the Middle East.

461
00:13:23,801 --> 00:13:24,760
Can't do that here.

462
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,670
We'll see what all these people in the
street and they're filming the Ferrari.

463
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,130
That's like a million dollar car.

464
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,000
That's ridiculous.

465
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:31,301
Yeah,

466
00:13:31,301 --> 00:13:32,770
I think that's a La Ferrari.

467
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:34,120
I think that's a million dollar car.

468
00:13:34,121 --> 00:13:36,790
Plus it might even be more
than a middle of the GT three.

469
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,250
There's the big run.

470
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:42,820
I mean these guys have insane amounts
of money and they're buying up giant

471
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:45,370
houses in Beverly Hills and
homeboy do with the girl though.

472
00:13:45,371 --> 00:13:46,031
We get in trouble.

473
00:13:46,031 --> 00:13:49,090
I bet they don't know shit cash.

474
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:50,111
I don't know.

475
00:13:50,111 --> 00:13:51,160
I don't know what happened,

476
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,390
but I know he got arrested.

477
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:55,120
I have no idea what the
actual reality of the cases,

478
00:13:55,121 --> 00:13:56,320
but I know the dude got arrested.

479
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,361
Crazy,

480
00:13:58,361 --> 00:13:58,560
right?

481
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,680
I was watching Narcos,

482
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,320
artists.

483
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,153
This shit.

484
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,920
It makes game of thrones
look like Harry Potter,

485
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:06,783
Dude.

486
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,560
And it's true.

487
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,840
I'm scared to get into it.

488
00:14:10,841 --> 00:14:12,400
I just got just 10 episodes.

489
00:14:12,401 --> 00:14:13,234
They

490
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:15,423
knocked out,

491
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:16,810
knocked out 10 and two days.

492
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,210
You're done with it yet.

493
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:20,770
I just finished this week.

494
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:21,663
Meanwhile I'm stuck.

495
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:23,500
I'm stuck on a bad show right now.

496
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:23,740
What?

497
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:24,250
Empire?

498
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:24,521
No,

499
00:14:24,521 --> 00:14:26,170
the strain is empire bad.

500
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:26,781
I heard it.

501
00:14:26,781 --> 00:14:27,130
You know what?

502
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:27,880
It's good.

503
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,300
The first,

504
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,470
the first season was good.

505
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:31,330
If you don't have anything else to watch,

506
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,193
it's good.

507
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:33,070
Fuck that.

508
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:33,330
No,

509
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,163
if there's no,

510
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:39,250
it's better than watching whatever's
on at two in the morning on regular TV.

511
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:40,230
But man,

512
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:42,310
as season one or season two just started.

513
00:14:42,311 --> 00:14:44,770
I just watched the season
premiere yesterday.

514
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,120
Whoa dude.

515
00:14:46,121 --> 00:14:48,430
Kenny Rogers is finally looking
like Kenny Rogers again.

516
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,960
They reversed some of that,

517
00:14:49,961 --> 00:14:52,110
a crazy facial surgery that they did on

518
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:52,670
them.

519
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,200
That was some sad shit dude.

520
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,120
He looked like monetarily
Silva to know he got it.

521
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,830
It didn't look anything like him.

522
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,200
They pulled his face way.

523
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:02,270
Where do the girls do that too?

524
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,850
They get while they go to a bad doctor.

525
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:05,361
I mean,

526
00:15:05,361 --> 00:15:07,880
apparently if you go to a good
doctor that knows what they're doing,

527
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:08,770
they can,

528
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:09,050
uh,

529
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:10,850
they can tighten you up
and it looks pretty good.

530
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,380
I feel like they all look the same.

531
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,990
They all look the exact same.

532
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,630
The ones that we're recognizing
or the ones that are terrible.

533
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,910
I think that's why we say
they all look the same.

534
00:15:19,911 --> 00:15:23,660
I think there's some attractive older
women that have had like little nips and

535
00:15:23,661 --> 00:15:24,494
Tucks,

536
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:25,430
you know,

537
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:28,460
but I think when we see
something like Kenny Rogers,

538
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:28,671
you know,

539
00:15:28,671 --> 00:15:30,620
there's something hideous about it,

540
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:31,040
right?

541
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:35,200
If someone chose to squeeze their
face tight to erase some of the lines,

542
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:35,870
bomber man,

543
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:36,703
you know what I mean?

544
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:38,390
Because.

545
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:38,661
Yeah.

546
00:15:38,661 --> 00:15:39,830
Because especially that guy,

547
00:15:39,831 --> 00:15:41,690
he was like this beloved character,

548
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:42,051
you know,

549
00:15:42,051 --> 00:15:42,211
the,

550
00:15:42,211 --> 00:15:42,650
the whole,

551
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:43,580
the gambler series.

552
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,091
Oh,

553
00:15:44,091 --> 00:15:44,511
sweet.

554
00:15:44,511 --> 00:15:46,210
Lefthand seats.

555
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:48,410
But don't you think those
guys like the celebrities,

556
00:15:48,411 --> 00:15:51,380
like they're so used to people seeing
them for that so that they don't want to

557
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,280
ever let it go.

558
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:52,560
You know what?

559
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,240
Yes.

560
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:53,481
Oh,

561
00:15:53,481 --> 00:15:53,871
I'm sorry.

562
00:15:53,871 --> 00:15:55,550
We never sink this fucking show up.

563
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,420
We never do.

564
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:59,210
And Jamie pull up on the screen.

565
00:15:59,211 --> 00:16:00,170
Who these guys are,

566
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:01,520
because this is a wild fight.

567
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:02,640
These guys fight

568
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:05,230
the duty stands southpaw.

569
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:07,280
The guy in the red with white.

570
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:11,570
He's got a nasty lefthand eaton
shots and these guys are tired too.

571
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,710
They're in the third round here.

572
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:17,060
Are they from like a tough Japan
or some those bullshit shorts?

573
00:16:17,061 --> 00:16:18,320
I didn't bring my um,

574
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,850
I didn't bring my laptop today.

575
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,460
A full short says UFC road did Japan.

576
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:23,820
What is that?

577
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,760
Is that it has to be some sort of.

578
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,151
Oh,

579
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:26,984
this is like the.

580
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:28,101
Oh my God,

581
00:16:28,101 --> 00:16:28,700
they're even shots.

582
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,080
So here's the gentleman's name,

583
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:31,580
how you say that

584
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:37,390
Mizuho Horchata and to Toronto.

585
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:42,640
Ishihara Ishihara is the
guy with the crazy hair.

586
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:45,861
They didn't,

587
00:16:45,861 --> 00:16:46,940
they have like a weird,

588
00:16:46,941 --> 00:16:47,121
like,

589
00:16:47,121 --> 00:16:50,450
mock tough where Barnett and
Nelson were the coach or some shit.

590
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,110
Did they?

591
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:51,943
And there was like,

592
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:52,320
I'm.

593
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,730
So I was like on UFC fight pass
may or some shit like that.

594
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:59,510
Like the countdown to Japan is almost
too many fighters to pay attention to.

595
00:16:59,600 --> 00:16:59,781
Oh,

596
00:16:59,781 --> 00:17:00,531
for sure.

597
00:17:00,531 --> 00:17:01,520
At the they're at number.

598
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,380
Oh Shit.

599
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,213
A comeback.

600
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,021
Hurghada oh,

601
00:17:07,021 --> 00:17:07,461
sweet.

602
00:17:07,461 --> 00:17:08,580
And right hand by Hiroto.

603
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:09,480
Oh my goodness.

604
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:11,580
That dude took a lot of shots to.

605
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:11,941
Dude.

606
00:17:11,941 --> 00:17:14,220
Have you seen the Japanese ring card girl?

607
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:17,110
Very pretty adorable young lady.

608
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:18,953
Her.

609
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:19,351
I just,

610
00:17:19,351 --> 00:17:19,800
I'm a,

611
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,610
I'm a fan.

612
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:21,900
Of course the American ones.

613
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:22,860
Very beautiful.

614
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:23,730
She was,

615
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:26,670
she might have went to number
one from the Japanese one.

616
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,760
He's got bloody see this creature.

617
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,890
Let me ask you this about
when it comes to girls bodies,

618
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:36,390
you prefer 10 pounds overweight
or 10 pounds underweight?

619
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,250
Ten pounds over every time.

620
00:17:38,251 --> 00:17:38,940
Right?

621
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:39,480
Every time.

622
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,150
Listen,

623
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:41,570
hop over.

624
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,380
Little fat ain't going to hurt nobody.

625
00:17:43,381 --> 00:17:44,700
Little little belly roll.

626
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,270
Nah.

627
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,820
Gives you a little extra gas.

628
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:48,810
No one wants a bag of bones in the bed.

629
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:49,700
I feel everything.

630
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,010
I want to be

631
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:51,190
skinny for other girls.

632
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:51,720
Yeah,

633
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,620
that's what I'm saying.

634
00:17:52,621 --> 00:17:54,990
When you think when you see those
girls walking around the ring,

635
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:57,040
they want to be like a skinny as possible.

636
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:57,950
Like in this culture.

637
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:59,310
In our culture in Brazil,

638
00:17:59,311 --> 00:17:59,550
they don't.

639
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:00,331
They're not like that man.

640
00:18:00,331 --> 00:18:01,260
Those girls are thick,

641
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:02,770
but they have flat stomach.

642
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:03,653
Yes.

643
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:05,960
They're in very good shape
because we're in very good shape.

644
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:06,420
Well,

645
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,920
they're all in very good shape,

646
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:11,730
but there's just so much worry about
putting a little weight on anybody.

647
00:18:11,731 --> 00:18:13,050
Like a girl that has like a little,

648
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:14,610
like an extra 10 pounds.

649
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:18,100
If I'm managing the green girls,

650
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,440
they're fucking even Mickey d's.

651
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,753
You know what I'm saying?

652
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:22,350
They don't know that though.

653
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,020
Don't you think that they think they know?

654
00:18:24,021 --> 00:18:27,510
All they do is drink fucking coffee and
water and like ice cubes for dinner.

655
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:29,610
Especially a few days before.

656
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,510
One hundred percent.

657
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:30,721
Yeah.

658
00:18:30,721 --> 00:18:31,170
Nah,

659
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:31,650
Nah.

660
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:32,730
Get that full rack of ribs.

661
00:18:32,731 --> 00:18:33,160
Girls.

662
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:33,931
It's crazy.

663
00:18:33,931 --> 00:18:34,350
Right?

664
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:34,951
It's crazy.

665
00:18:34,951 --> 00:18:35,201
It is.

666
00:18:35,201 --> 00:18:39,600
So it's a weird thing because every guy
talked to almost universally has the

667
00:18:39,601 --> 00:18:40,261
same opinion,

668
00:18:40,261 --> 00:18:40,860
like,

669
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:45,000
like a little bit of body weight on
a girl doesn't bother you at all.

670
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,540
You're not my friend if
you like skinny bitches,

671
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,840
fucking skinny girls.

672
00:18:51,841 --> 00:18:54,960
No Way with like a skinny girls.

673
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:56,870
There's some skinny girls are hot as fuck.

674
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,410
So some girls are just sexy,

675
00:18:58,411 --> 00:18:58,570
right?

676
00:18:58,570 --> 00:18:59,190
I agree.

677
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:01,440
There's girls but the appointment,

678
00:19:01,441 --> 00:19:02,190
but no one.

679
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:03,110
They don't look hot.

680
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,350
If they look like they're hungry,

681
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,530
you know she's not
supposed to look hungry.

682
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,140
I don't want you to be all
nervous because I'm going to

683
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:16,940
feed this poor kid Jesus Christ
rice at the time when he come over,

684
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,750
that idea that these
poor models have that.

685
00:19:18,751 --> 00:19:21,180
They have to be coat racks like shit.

686
00:19:21,181 --> 00:19:22,080
That's crazy.

687
00:19:22,081 --> 00:19:23,140
That doesn't even make sense.

688
00:19:23,141 --> 00:19:24,630
I guys want to be real big.

689
00:19:24,631 --> 00:19:28,470
Most girls aren't in big muscular
dude's just other dudes are.

690
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:29,131
You know what I'm saying?

691
00:19:29,131 --> 00:19:31,560
There's guys out there
that did look at a girl go,

692
00:19:31,561 --> 00:19:32,131
oh my God,

693
00:19:32,131 --> 00:19:35,460
she has an amazing body and she's really
skinny and as big tits they liked the

694
00:19:35,461 --> 00:19:36,960
big tits and like no ass.

695
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:43,110
There's a balance thing that
I think people recognize
and there's one thing that

696
00:19:43,111 --> 00:19:47,940
a lot of like big weightlifter dudes
do is if no one's coaching them,

697
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:51,980
they'll get out of fucking balance where
they go way titty heavy and way bicep

698
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:52,863
heavy,

699
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:53,320
right?

700
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,600
Then they get these skinny
ass next and you're like,

701
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,041
dude,

702
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:58,140
I know if the weight goes weird on you,

703
00:19:58,141 --> 00:19:58,891
you can't handle it.

704
00:19:58,891 --> 00:19:59,760
Look at that skinny neck.

705
00:19:59,761 --> 00:20:01,170
You have this.

706
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,790
What is holding you together?

707
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,950
Like your pillar that the whole column
in the center is made out of dog shit.

708
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,330
Like you can't do that.

709
00:20:09,331 --> 00:20:11,160
You can't have giant
biceps and old skinny neck.

710
00:20:11,161 --> 00:20:11,994
It's just crazy.

711
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,710
Like those guys that
compete in the Olympia.

712
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,820
Phil Heath is my boy,

713
00:20:14,821 --> 00:20:16,860
but none of those guys or ladies,

714
00:20:16,861 --> 00:20:17,071
man,

715
00:20:17,071 --> 00:20:17,611
you know what I'm saying?

716
00:20:17,611 --> 00:20:21,420
Like they don't have all
these fact there so jacked.

717
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:25,320
I bet like you have to be one of those
freaky bodybuilder chicks to be into that

718
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,100
for sure.

719
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,060
Or just be a girl.

720
00:20:27,061 --> 00:20:28,440
It's just this girl sort of freaks.

721
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:29,303
Right?

722
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:30,990
They're like different.

723
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:33,450
There's girls that are like
bodybuilder type chicken,

724
00:20:33,451 --> 00:20:34,850
but they're just not that big that just.

725
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:35,551
They just started.

726
00:20:35,551 --> 00:20:36,960
They're like a year and a half into it.

727
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,160
Perfect.

728
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,450
It looks like they're
in great shape there.

729
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:42,720
They're probably going to get
too big and a couple of years,

730
00:20:42,721 --> 00:20:44,150
but they're like white belts,

731
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:45,151
shoulders,

732
00:20:45,151 --> 00:20:45,391
man.

733
00:20:45,391 --> 00:20:46,460
If she has like big shoulders,

734
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,313
I can't do it.

735
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:48,340
I can't fucking

736
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,173
do it.

737
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:49,600
You know?

738
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,151
I have a,

739
00:20:50,151 --> 00:20:54,670
I have a theory about why a girl
wouldn't be into a big body builder dude.

740
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,770
Like that type of thing
wouldn't be bigger.

741
00:20:56,771 --> 00:21:00,250
Is better because I think
like evolutionarily,

742
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,050
like in the girl's DNA,

743
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:06,550
she wants a man that can survive and I
think in everybody knows that a guy like

744
00:21:06,551 --> 00:21:06,760
that,

745
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,320
like there's so much maintenance
involved first of all,

746
00:21:09,321 --> 00:21:10,390
and staying that big.

747
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,040
It's so preposterous.

748
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:13,000
It's so unnatural.

749
00:21:13,001 --> 00:21:17,260
And how many flights of stairs can that
guy go up before his heart explodes?

750
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:20,740
Super Fuck you mean for a
regular person like Bill Gates,

751
00:21:20,741 --> 00:21:21,470
you bribe.

752
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:21,960
Been like,

753
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,180
ah,

754
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:25,060
so your regular athlete
at Guy Even the gym,

755
00:21:25,061 --> 00:21:25,331
you know,

756
00:21:25,331 --> 00:21:28,000
I do a few thing these guys don't have.

757
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:32,020
There's nothing in comparison to the
demands that those fucking bodies have.

758
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:32,621
Not to mention.

759
00:21:32,621 --> 00:21:37,120
These bitches are eating fucking chicken
breast and asparagus every other hour

760
00:21:37,121 --> 00:21:38,860
and just sweating and sweating,

761
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,420
sweating and have no body fat.

762
00:21:40,421 --> 00:21:43,570
Like they're literally close to
blacking out every time they stand up.

763
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:48,100
When those guys get down to that shred
their asked cheeks have like fucking

764
00:21:48,101 --> 00:21:48,934
rubber tire.

765
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:54,740
You know when girls crossed that threshold
of the assets and hip start to lift

766
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:58,720
so much that it's almost
like a guy's muscular ass.

767
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:01,050
Big Muscular.

768
00:22:01,051 --> 00:22:01,884
I'm there.

769
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:03,530
It's rounded.

770
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,750
Fuck from the profile.

771
00:22:04,751 --> 00:22:05,860
Looks fucking amazing.

772
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:10,600
But when you look at it straight back
and she's walking like a dude too much

773
00:22:10,601 --> 00:22:12,400
lower bar for sex,

774
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,830
like looks like Shankar
went straight on that.

775
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:22,080
Did I ever tell you about this big 230
pound dude just pumped me in front of a

776
00:22:22,331 --> 00:22:23,164
girl before.

777
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:24,360
But no,

778
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,320
my aunt hooked me up with this chick.

779
00:22:26,321 --> 00:22:28,930
She used to always tried to hook
up with chicks and she's like,

780
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:29,950
I got a new one for you.

781
00:22:29,951 --> 00:22:30,430
She's at my,

782
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:31,263
she's a,

783
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:31,980
she works with,

784
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:34,300
her name is dawn and
we're going to go out.

785
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:35,223
So I went out with.

786
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,940
I went out with dawn and my aunt,

787
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:40,870
we went to go meet a guy
that my aunt was seen,

788
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:45,780
but he brings this giant
230 pound linebacker.

789
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:48,070
And so it's three dudes and chicks.

790
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,133
I'm like,

791
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,141
there's a little problem.

792
00:22:50,141 --> 00:22:50,974
Where at Bennigan's?

793
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:51,610
Yeah.

794
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:52,000
And uh,

795
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,900
she wasn't drinking,

796
00:22:52,901 --> 00:22:53,734
so I'm thinking this,

797
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,540
this is probably not
going to happen tonight.

798
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:57,410
So we gotta go on the
dance with this girl.

799
00:22:57,411 --> 00:22:58,240
So freak,

800
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,800
zero alcohol and she's a freak.

801
00:22:59,801 --> 00:23:01,480
She's all over me making out with me.

802
00:23:01,481 --> 00:23:01,750
I'm like,

803
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:01,901
oh,

804
00:23:01,901 --> 00:23:03,830
I got this one that it was in a bag

805
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:07,630
that we take a break,

806
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:08,740
we take a break.

807
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:11,860
The linebacker comes up
and asked her to dance.

808
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,300
He's on the dance floor,

809
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:14,830
making out there looking at me,

810
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,480
giving me this evil look like.

811
00:23:16,481 --> 00:23:16,691
I'm like,

812
00:23:16,691 --> 00:23:17,800
Oh man,

813
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:20,140
this guy's totally dominating me.

814
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:24,280
Punking me jungle like right there
in front of my aunt and this girl,

815
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,750
he's all over town now.

816
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:26,690
He owns a scrub.

817
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,810
The clubs over the lights turn on.

818
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,820
The lights turned on and

819
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:33,940
he's looking at me and
he's leaning against.

820
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:35,890
We're trying to figure out what we're
going to do and he's holding the lights

821
00:23:35,891 --> 00:23:36,724
and he goes,

822
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:37,833
where you at?

823
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:40,023
Where you at?

824
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:40,751
Oh my goodness.

825
00:23:40,751 --> 00:23:41,141
And I'm like,

826
00:23:41,141 --> 00:23:41,411
man,

827
00:23:41,411 --> 00:23:42,160
I'm,

828
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,630
I'm right here doing nothing.

829
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:45,710
Just shriveling up.

830
00:23:45,711 --> 00:23:47,870
It turned into like a nightmare night.

831
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,150
So it's 1991.

832
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:51,260
There was no cell phones.

833
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,080
So the plan was to meet
at my aunt's house.

834
00:23:54,081 --> 00:23:54,750
Right?

835
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:55,101
I'm like,

836
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:55,551
okay.

837
00:23:55,551 --> 00:23:56,480
I drove with them.

838
00:23:56,481 --> 00:23:56,691
I go,

839
00:23:56,691 --> 00:23:57,321
give me the keys.

840
00:23:57,321 --> 00:23:58,220
You guys drank too much.

841
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:00,890
These guys have to follow
us to my aunt's house.

842
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:03,800
Watch this little Honda prelude.

843
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,030
I'm on the freeway.

844
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:05,761
My aunt's go,

845
00:24:05,761 --> 00:24:06,620
and you're going to lose them.

846
00:24:06,621 --> 00:24:07,371
You're going to lose them.

847
00:24:07,371 --> 00:24:07,641
I'm like,

848
00:24:07,641 --> 00:24:07,821
no,

849
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:08,151
I'm not.

850
00:24:08,151 --> 00:24:08,990
The right behind me.

851
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,300
Lost Him.

852
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,040
Got Back home,

853
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,440
my aunt on the phone trying to fit,

854
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:14,690
you know,

855
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:18,980
because you got to go to a payphone
to get then call the house.

856
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,330
That can take 30 minutes.

857
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,193
Wow.

858
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:21,531
Yeah.

859
00:24:21,531 --> 00:24:23,770
So I lost him on purpose later.

860
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:24,221
Last.

861
00:24:24,221 --> 00:24:26,940
Try to pick up a girl with your
aunt and then going to Bennigan's

862
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:31,830
if it works out,

863
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:33,050
if it works out.

864
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:35,810
If at the end of the story
he has the best sex ever.

865
00:24:35,811 --> 00:24:39,620
He and the girl they smoke a little weed
and have the best sex of or something

866
00:24:39,621 --> 00:24:40,041
like that.

867
00:24:40,041 --> 00:24:40,400
But if,

868
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,260
but if the industry was that it was,

869
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:44,840
you know,

870
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,200
I had sex with her for 30
seconds for 30 seconds.

871
00:24:48,201 --> 00:24:49,034
He did.

872
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,290
I wanted to get revenge on her.

873
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:51,741
Oh,

874
00:24:51,741 --> 00:24:52,490
after all this.

875
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:52,880
No,

876
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,481
I didn't finish it.

877
00:24:53,481 --> 00:24:54,060
We get to,

878
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,370
we get to my aunt's house.

879
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,970
I take it right back to the house.

880
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:57,670
I know,

881
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:58,461
I know I had 20,

882
00:24:58,461 --> 00:25:00,200
30 minutes before that.

883
00:25:00,201 --> 00:25:01,550
We're going to figure out
where the hell she lived.

884
00:25:01,551 --> 00:25:02,610
I lost my purpose.

885
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:03,700
So I,

886
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:04,010
I'm,

887
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:04,271
I'm,

888
00:25:04,271 --> 00:25:05,450
I'm gonna get a little revenge here.

889
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:06,470
So she was all over me.

890
00:25:06,471 --> 00:25:07,820
She was just a wild girl,

891
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:09,500
had sex with him for 30 seconds,

892
00:25:09,501 --> 00:25:11,450
and as soon as I was
done she had just begun.

893
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:11,791
I said,

894
00:25:11,791 --> 00:25:13,460
I gotta move my car really quick.

895
00:25:13,461 --> 00:25:14,121
I'm going to get a ticket.

896
00:25:14,121 --> 00:25:15,950
I'll be right back out in my car.

897
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:16,731
I was gone.

898
00:25:16,731 --> 00:25:17,600
Never heard from her ever,

899
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,560
ever again.

900
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,920
I've never met a hot dog.

901
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:22,540
Hot Dog.

902
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,000
Really?

903
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:23,560
Oh yeah.

904
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,870
They're full full name though.

905
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,020
No,

906
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:27,561
I don't remember.

907
00:25:27,561 --> 00:25:28,400
It was just dawn.

908
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:29,571
She was hot as fuck.

909
00:25:29,571 --> 00:25:30,740
She was way too smart.

910
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,400
Damn.

911
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,810
I was way too stupid at the time.

912
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:35,380
I was like a 21 and uh,

913
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,253
she was uh,

914
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,250
at least my age,

915
00:25:37,251 --> 00:25:38,360
maybe a year older.

916
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:40,160
She used to work for this
comedy club that I worked at.

917
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:44,030
She graduated from Harvard with
a degree in women's studies.

918
00:25:44,031 --> 00:25:46,340
She's a terrifying conversations.

919
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:47,480
I bet.

920
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,710
Way Too smart for do this.

921
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:51,980
The time I was,

922
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:53,060
I knew it too.

923
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:53,830
Never,

924
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:54,830
never even tried to hit on her.

925
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:56,240
Never tried to pick her up.

926
00:25:56,241 --> 00:25:56,451
I'm like,

927
00:25:56,451 --> 00:25:56,561
dude,

928
00:25:56,561 --> 00:25:57,830
I'm your intimidated way too.

929
00:25:57,831 --> 00:25:58,664
Stupid brain.

930
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,391
Oh yeah,

931
00:25:59,391 --> 00:25:59,541
yeah,

932
00:25:59,541 --> 00:25:59,661
yeah.

933
00:25:59,661 --> 00:26:00,480
For sure.

934
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,820
She was hot too and yeah,

935
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:04,910
I just wasn't ready for that.

936
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:07,160
Our boy cocoon back.

937
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:08,960
Diego Brandao his last fight.

938
00:26:08,961 --> 00:26:09,794
Tony Ferguson.

939
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:11,260
I think Merck got.

940
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,640
Damn Tony Ferguson scaring you.

941
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,410
Tony Ferguson is just.

942
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:20,010
He's capable of fighting a hundred percent
of his ability when he gets in there

943
00:26:20,011 --> 00:26:20,900
and it was a tough fight.

944
00:26:20,901 --> 00:26:23,240
Now it's got a very tough
fight with Tony Ferguson.

945
00:26:23,241 --> 00:26:24,560
Does not fold up shop.

946
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,450
He's like a steady as a rock.

947
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:27,540
So game he.

948
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:29,940
So I haven't seen a guy game
like him since our ideas.

949
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,320
Ideas.

950
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,390
It's scary.

951
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:35,150
Tony Ferguson is scary and
the work ethic is incredible.

952
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:36,173
You can tell.

953
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,150
We can tell for sure.

954
00:26:37,151 --> 00:26:38,360
It gets better every fight,

955
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:40,250
but this next one's a real.

956
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:43,020
I mean this is where we decide
where he's going to go 100

957
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:45,950
off to the races.

958
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:46,920
The Habib,

959
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,840
Norma madoff where people
don't know what the fight is.

960
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:49,850
Habib number got mad.

961
00:26:49,851 --> 00:26:51,030
Office undefeated.

962
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:55,320
He's a former world champion and
one of the best grapplers in MMA.

963
00:26:55,321 --> 00:26:58,840
He's a fucking octopus and he beat
the champ already in Dos Anjos.

964
00:26:58,870 --> 00:26:59,690
Seton dos Anjos.

965
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:00,720
He ragdolled them.

966
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:02,140
He ragdolled dos Anjos.

967
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:04,740
And especially the second and third
round he starts breaking guys,

968
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:07,310
but this pressure is
fucking takedowns are nasty,

969
00:27:07,311 --> 00:27:07,771
is ground up,

970
00:27:07,771 --> 00:27:08,604
house nasty.

971
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:11,520
He's so dominant in grappling,

972
00:27:11,521 --> 00:27:13,140
but he's coming off that injury,

973
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:14,310
a long layoff.

974
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:16,150
So if there's any time to catch him,

975
00:27:16,151 --> 00:27:17,460
it's now and you know,

976
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,420
who knows how much damage he had done
to his knee because there was more than

977
00:27:21,421 --> 00:27:22,380
one injury.

978
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,580
There was several injuries,

979
00:27:23,581 --> 00:27:25,140
like it wasn't just like heard it,

980
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,093
got it repaired,

981
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,270
did the proper due diligence.

982
00:27:27,271 --> 00:27:27,991
And then came back.

983
00:27:27,991 --> 00:27:28,651
There was another,

984
00:27:28,651 --> 00:27:30,930
there was another injury
I believe during Rehab.

985
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,183
So he,

986
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:34,110
he heard it at surgery,

987
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:35,430
went to Rehab,

988
00:27:35,431 --> 00:27:35,911
did all that,

989
00:27:35,911 --> 00:27:36,391
got better,

990
00:27:36,391 --> 00:27:37,260
hurt it again.

991
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:40,260
So we're dealing with a real problem here.

992
00:27:40,261 --> 00:27:43,320
And it also could be one of the
reasons why he's so fucking good.

993
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:47,610
He's so good because he's
relentless for Roche's bulldog.

994
00:27:47,611 --> 00:27:48,270
Dude.

995
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:48,771
You know what I mean?

996
00:27:48,771 --> 00:27:49,040
That mother,

997
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,790
motherfucker doesn't take a step back.

998
00:27:50,791 --> 00:27:51,870
He attacks attacks.

999
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,460
That's all those boys at k though.

1000
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:53,910
Yeah,

1001
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:55,420
we'll think about it as well.

1002
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,670
But particularly him.

1003
00:27:56,671 --> 00:27:58,140
Especially with the grand plan though,

1004
00:27:58,190 --> 00:27:59,220
teams got like that too.

1005
00:27:59,360 --> 00:27:59,870
But look,

1006
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:03,900
look at his knees and look and
look at dc had a knee injury.

1007
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:04,610
But that's,

1008
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:05,281
you know what man?

1009
00:28:05,281 --> 00:28:06,000
It's like don't,

1010
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,590
isn't that like a part of that package,

1011
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,900
like a part of that package
is your red line in your body.

1012
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:11,070
That's what it comes with the territory.

1013
00:28:11,071 --> 00:28:11,360
Right.

1014
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,450
And you're going to break some shit.

1015
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,650
Spar DC one time.

1016
00:28:13,651 --> 00:28:13,861
I was like,

1017
00:28:13,861 --> 00:28:15,120
what the fuck?

1018
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,070
What the fuck are we doing?

1019
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:18,541
Pressure?

1020
00:28:18,541 --> 00:28:19,080
Huh?

1021
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:19,560
No,

1022
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,090
just coming around.

1023
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,530
How many want to go shop?

1024
00:28:22,531 --> 00:28:22,800
Eight.

1025
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,633
Nah Man,

1026
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:24,480
I'm cool.

1027
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,650
She's just keeps coming.

1028
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,633
Keeps coming.

1029
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:28,050
We've never seen anything like it.

1030
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,610
That's what happens
when you work with Kane,

1031
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:30,151
you know,

1032
00:28:30,151 --> 00:28:33,490
him and Cain both feed off each
other and I think that was like a,

1033
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:34,400
a,

1034
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,470
like a huge contributing
factor to who he is right now.

1035
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:38,850
I agree 100 percent.

1036
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:40,350
You can get that Olympic drive.

1037
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:41,640
And when those two get together,

1038
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:45,900
both of them together just fucking
sharpening rockhold into the mix.

1039
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:46,793
Oh yeah.

1040
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:49,800
And a bunch of other guys there
now to touch other guys in there.

1041
00:28:49,801 --> 00:28:52,650
Now where rockhold right now on fire.

1042
00:28:52,651 --> 00:28:53,550
That's a big fight.

1043
00:28:53,551 --> 00:28:56,010
That fucking December's the best
fight in middleweight history.

1044
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:56,311
Yeah,

1045
00:28:56,311 --> 00:28:57,144
I think you're right.

1046
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,013
I think you're right.

1047
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:03,020
I think other than the vandelay not
vandelay other than the Anderson Weidman,

1048
00:29:03,511 --> 00:29:06,390
the first fight before
weidman knocked him out,

1049
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,530
but before that fight,

1050
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:10,500
that was the biggest fight in history
because Weidman was a crusher.

1051
00:29:10,501 --> 00:29:11,850
We knew why it was a crusher.

1052
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,890
We saw a whiteman did the Munoz.

1053
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:16,120
We saw this dude's just looks unstoppable.

1054
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,400
Coffee's shit.

1055
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:18,420
Super Solid.

1056
00:29:18,421 --> 00:29:18,940
Wrestler,

1057
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:19,800
knockout power.

1058
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,490
And then Anderson was the
motherfucker and we before that fight.

1059
00:29:23,491 --> 00:29:24,320
That was the biggest fight.

1060
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,830
Somewhere before that,

1061
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,400
when he got in and I feel like we.

1062
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:29,130
We've seen the best that I understand.

1063
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:33,930
I think now what we did before
that was the or fight man,

1064
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:34,981
the fight before,

1065
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:36,990
but he chose the matrix.

1066
00:29:36,991 --> 00:29:37,740
Joe,

1067
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,431
you know what?

1068
00:29:38,431 --> 00:29:39,264
I know mom.

1069
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,351
You're right.

1070
00:29:40,351 --> 00:29:40,690
You're right.

1071
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:41,890
Bonner's at the same level.

1072
00:29:41,891 --> 00:29:44,350
But the way he won was so shocked.

1073
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,070
It was insane.

1074
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:48,790
I was terrified and Banos on some
shit and he was on some shit.

1075
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:50,870
And then before that
he had destroyed shale.

1076
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:52,210
The veto or front kick.

1077
00:29:52,211 --> 00:29:52,451
I mean,

1078
00:29:52,451 --> 00:29:52,930
look,

1079
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:55,670
Anderson hadn't even been in trouble
except for the fight fighting.

1080
00:29:55,671 --> 00:29:58,990
Everybody knew he came into that fight
with injured ribs pretty much after the

1081
00:29:58,991 --> 00:29:59,201
fight.

1082
00:29:59,201 --> 00:30:00,034
Everybody knew.

1083
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,640
I just feel like I feel like Weidman's
beating dudes in their prime right now

1084
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:04,860
called beating dudes in the.

1085
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:08,790
When you're talking about fucking monsters
and now these two meet the both in

1086
00:30:08,791 --> 00:30:10,930
the front and Anderson fought Weidman.

1087
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:13,990
Anderson rather was considered the
greatest pound for pound fighter ever.

1088
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:14,913
I agree.

1089
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:18,580
I think at some point it maybe it
was that fight maybe was in camp.

1090
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:19,720
He lost that.

1091
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,040
That edge.

1092
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:21,760
You know what I'm saying?

1093
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,960
He could have been that.

1094
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:26,110
He lost that edge or could it be what
Weidman's just that motherfucker.

1095
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:26,441
He's just.

1096
00:30:26,441 --> 00:30:27,610
That could be that motherfucker,

1097
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:29,170
but before that fight,

1098
00:30:29,171 --> 00:30:31,870
I think that was the biggest fight of
all time and I think it still holds up.

1099
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:33,430
I think this is right up there with them.

1100
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:37,660
I just feel like style ron rankled
Weidman's a better style matchup.

1101
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:38,540
Like why men will.

1102
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:38,801
No,

1103
00:30:38,801 --> 00:30:39,041
man,

1104
00:30:39,041 --> 00:30:39,450
I do.

1105
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:41,620
I thought Anderson
Weidman was amazing style.

1106
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,980
Like it's always,

1107
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,530
why am I going to deal
with them on the feet?

1108
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,061
You know what?

1109
00:30:45,061 --> 00:30:45,940
Because I,

1110
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:51,180
I feel because I was going off trail
and Anderson and chill could kind of do

1111
00:30:51,551 --> 00:30:53,240
whatever you want and kept taking
him down to Kipp Tavi Nick,

1112
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:53,710
right?

1113
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:56,530
That first fight first and
kind of basically beat him.

1114
00:30:56,531 --> 00:30:58,810
Then ended up fucking up
at the very end again,

1115
00:30:58,811 --> 00:30:59,680
con that triangle.

1116
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:01,980
I feel like I'm at a
better striker than shale,

1117
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:02,903
better wrestler.

1118
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:05,380
So I feel like you put those
together if you wanted to,

1119
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:08,150
he could make it a boring fight and
win that fight every time you got to.

1120
00:31:08,151 --> 00:31:09,010
You got a good point.

1121
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:09,551
And you know,

1122
00:31:09,551 --> 00:31:10,181
you've got a good point,

1123
00:31:10,181 --> 00:31:12,250
especially about wyman submission ability,

1124
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:13,130
who he's nasty.

1125
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:14,440
He's submission ability is definitely,

1126
00:31:14,441 --> 00:31:16,000
but channels is underrated.

1127
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:17,900
Mean did submit shogun and economy.

1128
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:18,431
That gay teen.

1129
00:31:18,431 --> 00:31:20,440
I don't think anyone expected
that shale can submit.

1130
00:31:20,441 --> 00:31:23,290
Guys who did the arm triangle
to the arm triangle Stan Stan.

1131
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,700
He's a motherfucker man.

1132
00:31:24,701 --> 00:31:25,391
He's a strong,

1133
00:31:25,391 --> 00:31:26,320
powerful wrestler.

1134
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:26,741
You know,

1135
00:31:26,741 --> 00:31:27,360
chase has been,

1136
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,140
had inconsistent performances,

1137
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:32,140
but like when he was at his
best in that Anderson fight,

1138
00:31:32,141 --> 00:31:32,950
especially.

1139
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:33,220
Dude,

1140
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:33,760
he's net.

1141
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,001
How about,

1142
00:31:34,001 --> 00:31:35,020
how about the Marquardt fight?

1143
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,250
He's fucking nasty.

1144
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:37,243
Mean Chael Sonnen.

1145
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:38,620
I agree.

1146
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:39,940
He's a title to come.

1147
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,700
I love chill and Weidman
is a really good wrestler,

1148
00:31:42,701 --> 00:31:44,290
but I think like chill at his best.

1149
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:45,010
He's.

1150
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:48,040
He showed the same level
of wrestling mobility.

1151
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:48,790
But um,

1152
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:50,620
but as far as the mixed martial artists,

1153
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:52,110
that's just mixed martial artist.

1154
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:55,800
Chris Weidman striking is nasty machita.

1155
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:56,171
Yeah.

1156
00:31:56,171 --> 00:31:58,060
Much more dangerous with his power.

1157
00:31:58,510 --> 00:31:59,620
You see the Ryan Hall fight?

1158
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,370
You've seen that fight?

1159
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:00,790
Yes.

1160
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:01,460
Back in the day.

1161
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,130
Has the same left hook.

1162
00:32:03,131 --> 00:32:03,611
The same left.

1163
00:32:03,611 --> 00:32:04,001
Tosh hails.

1164
00:32:04,001 --> 00:32:05,950
Never been like a really good striker.

1165
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:06,800
No.

1166
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,470
Really like put it together.

1167
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,760
Chuck GSP style.

1168
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:12,310
He looked good in the Anderson fight
the first round when he caught Anderson

1169
00:32:12,311 --> 00:32:12,971
with the straight left.

1170
00:32:12,971 --> 00:32:13,180
True.

1171
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:13,540
He did.

1172
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,390
He came out good.

1173
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:14,940
Yeah.

1174
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:17,380
But the difference I think
is why many laser crusher,

1175
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:19,420
he crushes guys and we has you hurt.

1176
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:21,460
He turns into a fucking monster monster.

1177
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:22,630
He turns it on and smashes.

1178
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,200
Yeah.

1179
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:23,441
You know,

1180
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:25,390
you saw that in the
first year I haul fight.

1181
00:32:25,391 --> 00:32:27,400
You've seen it in a punch of the fucking.

1182
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:29,830
The Munoz fight was one of
the most terrifying elbow.

1183
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:31,023
Fuck man.

1184
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:34,990
I think Weidman rockhold is
definitely a fight for the ages,

1185
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:39,590
but I'm as excited about that as I
was the Anderson Weidman five for some

1186
00:32:39,591 --> 00:32:39,801
reason.

1187
00:32:39,801 --> 00:32:40,100
I'm

1188
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,680
more excited about it with them.

1189
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:42,530
I kind of,

1190
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:43,700
I couldn't get any more.

1191
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,430
I mean both of those fights
to me like the top of the.

1192
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:46,870
I agree.

1193
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:47,570
I see that.

1194
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:48,291
But you know what I'm saying?

1195
00:32:48,291 --> 00:32:49,700
I don't think this is
the biggest one ever.

1196
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:52,550
I think they're both like
the same level of huge.

1197
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:55,300
I think the Anderson Weidman
fight is just as big as this,

1198
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:55,870
this,

1199
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:56,150
this,

1200
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:56,480
you know,

1201
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,320
that fight was a crazy fight and the
way it ended with Anderson Clowning,

1202
00:33:00,321 --> 00:33:00,800
um,

1203
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,690
and why may catch him with that left hook.

1204
00:33:02,691 --> 00:33:03,021
I mean,

1205
00:33:03,021 --> 00:33:04,160
while it was happening,

1206
00:33:04,161 --> 00:33:06,920
I could not fucking believe my eyes.

1207
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:09,890
I think it kind of fucked Weidman because
no one took him serious and then they

1208
00:33:09,891 --> 00:33:10,151
fight.

1209
00:33:10,151 --> 00:33:10,331
They,

1210
00:33:10,331 --> 00:33:12,800
the rematch then fucking
inches like falls off.

1211
00:33:12,801 --> 00:33:13,250
Right.

1212
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:13,611
Then we're like,

1213
00:33:13,611 --> 00:33:14,444
fuck man,

1214
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:17,570
but then widen it finally kind of gets
his credit when he fights machida.

1215
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:18,260
Right.

1216
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,840
And then he destroys vittorio,

1217
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:21,200
but he's still like,

1218
00:33:21,201 --> 00:33:21,650
why?

1219
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:23,420
To me should be the
biggest star in the UFC.

1220
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:23,990
Yup.

1221
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:27,260
All American dude beats
the very best at one 85.

1222
00:33:27,261 --> 00:33:29,090
I don't give a fuck what
division one to talk about.

1223
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:29,901
One 85.

1224
00:33:29,901 --> 00:33:30,734
He's American.

1225
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:31,670
He speaks well.

1226
00:33:31,671 --> 00:33:32,660
He's Super Smart,

1227
00:33:32,661 --> 00:33:32,811
right?

1228
00:33:32,811 --> 00:33:33,710
He's a family guy.

1229
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,450
I don't know why it's not a bigger star.

1230
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,740
You got a really good point,

1231
00:33:36,741 --> 00:33:37,040
man.

1232
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,000
That's a really good point.

1233
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:39,770
I mean it's not like he
doesn't have the ability.

1234
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:40,251
No.

1235
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:43,780
He's like fucking are Nolan Ryan saying
you think it's because he likes school

1236
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:44,060
rep?

1237
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:47,020
Just don't know what it is.

1238
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,260
He's not a shit talker.

1239
00:33:48,261 --> 00:33:48,750
Right?

1240
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:49,940
Ricky's not a big shit talker,

1241
00:33:49,941 --> 00:33:50,530
but no,

1242
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:51,460
inside the gun.

1243
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:53,070
He is a mother fucker.

1244
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:53,391
Dude.

1245
00:33:53,391 --> 00:33:54,530
He's got something.

1246
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:57,290
There's something about
him that you can tell.

1247
00:33:57,291 --> 00:33:58,940
Like when guys go into it with him,

1248
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:00,100
like they see it on them.

1249
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:00,940
It's,

1250
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:01,551
it's weird.

1251
00:34:01,551 --> 00:34:01,891
It's like it's.

1252
00:34:01,891 --> 00:34:02,270
So.

1253
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:03,560
There's a few guys like that.

1254
00:34:03,561 --> 00:34:04,031
Like when,

1255
00:34:04,031 --> 00:34:06,560
when guys lock eyes with
them to see it in them.

1256
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:07,040
Yes.

1257
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,980
And he's one of those and that's why
the Anderson stare down with him was so

1258
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:13,610
interesting when Anderson got mouth to
mouth with him and Wyman looked and he

1259
00:34:13,611 --> 00:34:13,791
goes,

1260
00:34:13,791 --> 00:34:14,720
I'm not afraid of you dude.

1261
00:34:14,721 --> 00:34:15,230
Yeah man.

1262
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,880
But there was a reality to it.

1263
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:18,860
There was a reality to it
that Anderson was like,

1264
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:19,940
Oh shit.

1265
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:20,601
Some shit.

1266
00:34:20,601 --> 00:34:21,560
What have I done know?

1267
00:34:21,561 --> 00:34:23,090
Weidman wants to fight at a.

1268
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,020
He wants to fight Jon Jones,

1269
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:25,533
Jon Jones.

1270
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:28,970
And he thinks he can beat them.

1271
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,080
Well it's illegal.

1272
00:34:30,081 --> 00:34:31,460
And Jon Jones had some shit going.

1273
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:32,721
Well,

1274
00:34:32,721 --> 00:34:33,081
um,

1275
00:34:33,081 --> 00:34:35,300
I don't know what's going on
with the John Jones situation,

1276
00:34:35,301 --> 00:34:37,010
but I know he comes fresh out of prison.

1277
00:34:37,011 --> 00:34:38,690
Beats the fuck out of anyone in the world.

1278
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:40,040
He might not have to go to prison.

1279
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:40,890
What do you guys think about?

1280
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:43,130
Knows we haven't talked
about the rules are to you?

1281
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:44,000
I have no idea.

1282
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,640
I wish them that.

1283
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,471
I want to see him back,

1284
00:34:45,471 --> 00:34:45,920
man.

1285
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:49,070
I just don't want them to keep
telling this kind of behavior.

1286
00:34:49,071 --> 00:34:51,580
I think I liked John at his best.

1287
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,270
John's a fucking really interesting,

1288
00:34:53,271 --> 00:34:56,060
intelligent guy with a
crazy amount of stress,

1289
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,980
a crazy amount of responsibility.

1290
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:00,320
And you don't have a fighter
like given the UFC right now.

1291
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,400
We just don't.

1292
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:01,940
Well,

1293
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:04,220
he's definitely different
than everybody else.

1294
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:05,630
What about Nick Diaz?

1295
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:07,010
What do you guys feel about that?

1296
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:11,780
That's the worst travesty I've ever
heard of an ego thing in any of the

1297
00:35:11,781 --> 00:35:16,490
regulatory decisions that I've ever heard
about the center getting involved as

1298
00:35:16,491 --> 00:35:17,324
well that you're talking.

1299
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:17,750
Shit,

1300
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:22,750
they took his livelihood from five years
for me that they did it based on one

1301
00:35:24,051 --> 00:35:28,010
test that's not nearly as
accurate as the other two tests.

1302
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:31,190
The other two tests which were run
by the world antidoping agency,

1303
00:35:31,191 --> 00:35:32,300
the ones that take blood,

1304
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,670
those are way more accurate and those.

1305
00:35:34,671 --> 00:35:35,780
He passed two of them.

1306
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,530
He passed two of those blood cells

1307
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:42,450
and then they take this urine test and
they run it through this laboratory,

1308
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:45,150
but urine is just not nearly as accurate.

1309
00:35:45,151 --> 00:35:45,984
It's just not.

1310
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:49,590
So them getting on him
for that is fucking crazy.

1311
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:50,340
And then,

1312
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:50,701
you know,

1313
00:35:50,701 --> 00:35:52,350
I think they were upset
that he took the fifth.

1314
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:53,940
Okay.

1315
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:54,481
Four minutes.

1316
00:35:54,481 --> 00:35:56,710
Fifty six seconds right now in the cocoon.

1317
00:35:56,711 --> 00:35:56,811
Oh,

1318
00:35:56,811 --> 00:35:57,840
Diego Brandao fight.

1319
00:35:57,841 --> 00:35:58,680
There's an interesting fight.

1320
00:35:58,860 --> 00:35:59,251
Cocoon.

1321
00:35:59,251 --> 00:35:59,321
Oh,

1322
00:35:59,321 --> 00:36:00,270
have you never seen him before?

1323
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:01,680
He's got a weird style.

1324
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:04,740
A style that does not work.

1325
00:36:04,741 --> 00:36:05,320
Everybody will.

1326
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,710
Tony Ferguson lit him up with Tony.

1327
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:08,791
Oh Shit.

1328
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:09,690
He got cracked again.

1329
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,630
Bombs.

1330
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:13,260
Jesus.

1331
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,720
She goes ragdoll.

1332
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:15,890
Oh,

1333
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:17,190
that's fucked up.

1334
00:36:17,191 --> 00:36:17,671
That's it.

1335
00:36:17,671 --> 00:36:18,001
Diego.

1336
00:36:18,001 --> 00:36:18,834
Brandao.

1337
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:20,580
Good.

1338
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,001
God.

1339
00:36:21,001 --> 00:36:21,950
Vicious stoppage.

1340
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,250
Diego Brandao.

1341
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,630
That was Tommy hearns.

1342
00:36:24,631 --> 00:36:25,770
Marvin Hagler and shit.

1343
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:26,620
Oh my God.

1344
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:27,121
Beat down.

1345
00:36:27,121 --> 00:36:27,840
And Tommy hearns.

1346
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,400
Marvin Hagler went a full round.

1347
00:36:29,401 --> 00:36:30,150
Believe it or not.

1348
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:33,020
Went into the second
round when God was open.

1349
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,153
Coon iced.

1350
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:34,951
Maybe.

1351
00:36:34,951 --> 00:36:36,060
Let's go back to the drawing board.

1352
00:36:36,061 --> 00:36:36,270
Huh?

1353
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:37,103
Put your hands up.

1354
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:37,411
Well,

1355
00:36:37,411 --> 00:36:37,831
cocoon.

1356
00:36:37,831 --> 00:36:38,280
No,

1357
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,560
he used to have um,

1358
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:41,100
a lot of success with that.

1359
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:44,010
He has like a 45 degree
front kick that he throws.

1360
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:47,700
Have you seen it or it's
like a combination of a
roundhouse kick and a front

1361
00:36:47,701 --> 00:36:47,941
kick.

1362
00:36:47,941 --> 00:36:48,780
It's real weird.

1363
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:51,250
He hit guys right in the liver with it.

1364
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,650
It's fucking nasty,

1365
00:36:52,651 --> 00:36:53,190
man.

1366
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:53,490
Eddie,

1367
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:54,440
you've seen it before you.

1368
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,590
The one who told me about it,

1369
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:56,730
you were the first one who told me,

1370
00:36:56,731 --> 00:36:57,600
but you feel like you like.

1371
00:36:57,601 --> 00:36:58,650
Have you ever seen this guy in Japan?

1372
00:36:58,651 --> 00:36:59,480
He's throwing this kick.

1373
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,090
You Go.

1374
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:01,530
I don't think it's a roundhouse kick,

1375
00:37:01,531 --> 00:37:02,610
but it ain't like a front kick.

1376
00:37:02,611 --> 00:37:03,450
It's like something different.

1377
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,890
It's in between and he started like A.

1378
00:37:04,891 --> 00:37:05,430
Yeah,

1379
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:08,220
like a side snapping front.

1380
00:37:08,221 --> 00:37:11,370
Snap kick to the balls
of your feet to deliver.

1381
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,030
Not Anymore.

1382
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:12,540
You know what?

1383
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:14,100
When you throw a round kick,

1384
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,440
when you throw around Kyc
and you hit with the Shin,

1385
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:20,400
it's probably the most powerful way you
can throw it because your foot doesn't

1386
00:37:20,401 --> 00:37:21,234
give in.

1387
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:22,860
Like when you throw a kick with your foot,

1388
00:37:22,861 --> 00:37:26,700
your foot kind of gives a
little and you can hurt someone,

1389
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:30,150
but it's not nearly as effective with
like the ball of the foot as it is with

1390
00:37:30,151 --> 00:37:30,610
the heel.

1391
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:34,200
The heel is way more effective because
the heel doesn't have any give like this.

1392
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,410
You can have a little bit of resistance
because of your foot and it's like

1393
00:37:37,411 --> 00:37:39,920
hitting someone almost like
with like a cushion behind it.

1394
00:37:39,921 --> 00:37:40,320
Yeah,

1395
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,090
but the way cocoon was doing it,

1396
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:45,780
you could tell he had done it so many
times and his technique was so sharp.

1397
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:49,710
There was not much movement in his foot
and when he would pull his foot back,

1398
00:37:49,711 --> 00:37:50,050
he would,

1399
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:50,370
you know,

1400
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:52,410
really dig the ball of the foot in.

1401
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:54,360
There was like really high level stuff.

1402
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:57,120
Like a lot of cool Christian
guys are really good at that.

1403
00:37:57,330 --> 00:38:01,890
They develop that ability to throw those
front snap kicks with like they just,

1404
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,311
it gets.

1405
00:38:02,311 --> 00:38:04,170
So the technique,

1406
00:38:04,171 --> 00:38:08,040
it's so sharp that at the end of it
they're so good at like thrusting the ball

1407
00:38:08,041 --> 00:38:08,590
of the foot in there.

1408
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:09,270
Yeah.

1409
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:10,620
I think it's another
one of those kicks ban.

1410
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:13,050
We're starting to see more of
a cowboy uses that a lot now.

1411
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:14,640
He used that on Jim Miller.

1412
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,560
He's thrown that front kick to the body,

1413
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,230
but you're so same thing.

1414
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,840
You're hitting the guy with the
ball of the foot and bonded it.

1415
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:24,050
Connor did it to Chad on or did it Kinda.

1416
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:25,170
Does it align the body?

1417
00:38:25,171 --> 00:38:25,410
Uh,

1418
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:26,700
Anderson did face.

1419
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:27,270
Yep.

1420
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:28,103
Anderson did it.

1421
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:30,570
He was the first time is
aiming just for the liver,

1422
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,030
but he hasn't done it.

1423
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:35,610
You have to say he's done it a few times
in Japan and he's got some hands do

1424
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:36,453
that he liked.

1425
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:39,790
He has a great combo where he'll open
you up with hands and then he'll just to

1426
00:38:39,791 --> 00:38:41,500
land that thing and then vice versa.

1427
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:41,801
Well,

1428
00:38:41,801 --> 00:38:43,270
he hit Tony in that fight.

1429
00:38:43,271 --> 00:38:45,340
I mean he definitely caught
Tony with some good shop.

1430
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:46,840
Tony can take a punch to man.

1431
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:49,030
I just think Tony Hits even harder.

1432
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:49,631
You know,

1433
00:38:49,631 --> 00:38:50,030
Tony,

1434
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:51,140
she might be the hardest hitter.

1435
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:52,860
This weight for Rochus.

1436
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,580
Tony Ferguson's ferocious.

1437
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:55,331
Hey,

1438
00:38:55,331 --> 00:38:56,560
back to that ds thing though.

1439
00:38:56,561 --> 00:38:56,760
What,

1440
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,593
what do they do?

1441
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:58,330
What can you do?

1442
00:38:58,330 --> 00:38:59,230
I think they do.

1443
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,510
I think they take it to court
and I think they win easy.

1444
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,100
I don't think there's
a problem with winning.

1445
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,530
I think if you look at the facts,

1446
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:06,371
the fact that,

1447
00:39:06,371 --> 00:39:06,760
uh,

1448
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,730
he passed to water tests
that are much more stringent.

1449
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:11,163
The fact that,

1450
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:11,800
um,

1451
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,011
you know,

1452
00:39:12,011 --> 00:39:12,821
there's a threshold,

1453
00:39:12,821 --> 00:39:15,340
like they don't want you to be
high while you're competing.

1454
00:39:15,341 --> 00:39:16,480
I think that's reasonable.

1455
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:17,461
What the thresholds are.

1456
00:39:17,461 --> 00:39:22,270
Very low threshold is so low or so high
rather than like you could have smoked

1457
00:39:22,271 --> 00:39:27,170
pot a couple of days ago and you should
pass according to Jeff Novitsky and Jeff

1458
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:27,521
Novitsky should know.

1459
00:39:27,521 --> 00:39:28,150
Right.

1460
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:28,983
So,

1461
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:29,281
I mean,

1462
00:39:29,281 --> 00:39:30,970
I think they're reasonable about it.

1463
00:39:30,971 --> 00:39:34,270
I think what's reasonable or unreasonable
is they're not willing to take into

1464
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:35,920
consideration those other two tests.

1465
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:36,521
Like give.

1466
00:39:36,521 --> 00:39:39,850
There were reason like if they looked
at the chain of custody from the time,

1467
00:39:39,851 --> 00:39:40,990
like the blood was drawn,

1468
00:39:40,991 --> 00:39:42,490
it was all done to the water standard,

1469
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,151
which is,

1470
00:39:43,151 --> 00:39:43,481
you know,

1471
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:44,530
world anti-doping,

1472
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:44,951
right?

1473
00:39:44,951 --> 00:39:45,910
If it was done to that standard,

1474
00:39:45,911 --> 00:39:47,920
they should accept that those are better,

1475
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:51,040
more stringent tests and in fact they
shouldn't even need to perform their own

1476
00:39:51,041 --> 00:39:54,220
tests as long as there's
no suspicion of corruption.

1477
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:57,640
There's no suspicion that someone's
changing results are trying to protect a

1478
00:39:57,641 --> 00:39:59,440
fighter in the UFC doesn't do that.

1479
00:39:59,620 --> 00:39:59,910
Look,

1480
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:00,790
it'd be if they did.

1481
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:01,400
I mean,

1482
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,700
she looked at all the different
people that have been popped,

1483
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:04,220
you know,

1484
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:05,560
they wouldn't want those guys pop.

1485
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:07,180
Although did you hear the bell for thing?

1486
00:40:07,181 --> 00:40:07,960
Did you hear that thing?

1487
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,070
I was just going to bring that up.

1488
00:40:09,071 --> 00:40:09,904
I know,

1489
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:10,760
I know.

1490
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,593
You're right.

1491
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,321
What you're saying.

1492
00:40:13,321 --> 00:40:13,531
I was like,

1493
00:40:13,531 --> 00:40:14,364
well,

1494
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:16,450
when you're friends with Lorenzo,

1495
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:17,920
well he had um,

1496
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:22,950
apparently they had accidentally sent
out some results of one of vittores tests

1497
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:28,000
before he fought Jon Jones and he had
been flagged as having high testosterone,

1498
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:31,480
but I think this is while he
had a testosterone exemption.

1499
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:35,290
So I think the issue is not
that he used testosterone.

1500
00:40:35,291 --> 00:40:39,100
I think he was allowed to then that was
back when the UFC was kind of involved

1501
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:39,450
in.

1502
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:42,030
They were allowed to have
testosterone use exemptions.

1503
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:42,370
Yeah,

1504
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:43,470
I believe so.

1505
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,050
I don't correct.

1506
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:47,200
I don't think he was
doing anything illegal.

1507
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:48,580
I think it was just high.

1508
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,610
So I think like that they were talking
about it in an article I read that the

1509
00:40:51,611 --> 00:40:55,090
doctor would tell you like say if
you're the upper upper threshold is like

1510
00:40:55,091 --> 00:40:55,831
$1,200,

1511
00:40:55,831 --> 00:40:57,190
which is apparently like really crazy,

1512
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:57,760
right?

1513
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,830
If the doctor saw that you were 1100,

1514
00:40:59,831 --> 00:41:00,401
when they test you,

1515
00:41:00,401 --> 00:41:00,461
they,

1516
00:41:00,461 --> 00:41:00,671
they're like,

1517
00:41:00,671 --> 00:41:00,911
look,

1518
00:41:00,911 --> 00:41:01,744
you're a little high,

1519
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,550
like 10 above 10 is high.

1520
00:41:03,551 --> 00:41:06,850
So we want you to drop your dose down
a little bit and that that's what their

1521
00:41:06,851 --> 00:41:07,361
explanation.

1522
00:41:07,361 --> 00:41:08,830
What do we know what Victoria was that?

1523
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:12,310
Well I know at one point
he was tested at 1475.

1524
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:13,540
Yeah.

1525
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:15,760
Which is like super silver back.

1526
00:41:15,761 --> 00:41:17,440
Gorilla Hyena.

1527
00:41:17,441 --> 00:41:19,420
Dick fucked up.

1528
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:23,920
But people have tested real high before.

1529
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:26,260
I mean Nate Marquardt was
actually pulled out of a fight.

1530
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:27,370
Rick's Charlie Brennaman,

1531
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:27,900
Charlie Brenham,

1532
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,430
and took his place last minute
and one against Rick Story.

1533
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:31,540
Crazy fucking fight.

1534
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,920
Biggest fight of his career.

1535
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:36,980
And they pulled it out
because of Israel results.

1536
00:41:36,981 --> 00:41:37,610
Who's that?

1537
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:37,971
Who's that?

1538
00:41:37,971 --> 00:41:38,300
Hi.

1539
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,530
Like he had an exemption.

1540
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:39,960
Yeah.

1541
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,240
And they looked at his
results and they're like,

1542
00:41:41,241 --> 00:41:42,074
what?

1543
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:44,150
What and what are you doing?

1544
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:45,023
I know nate,

1545
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:46,180
you know I,

1546
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:47,380
well I know the,

1547
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:48,343
the

1548
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:54,330
tough titers when fighters are relying
on Dr who's another ego you don't like

1549
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:55,693
who the uh,

1550
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,780
could you tell him how much did to.

1551
00:41:57,790 --> 00:41:58,390
I couldn't.

1552
00:41:58,390 --> 00:41:59,590
I don't want.

1553
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:01,520
Who knows how much he's
going to take to put him in.

1554
00:42:01,521 --> 00:42:06,050
His legal limit is his doctor now is Dr.
gives them the same amount every week

1555
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:09,560
and then he's giving it to them on a
Monday and nate's getting tested on a

1556
00:42:09,561 --> 00:42:10,394
Friday.

1557
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:13,440
He's had a chance for his
levels to naturally go lower go.

1558
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,620
But when a guy's about to fight,

1559
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:19,400
the Dr. May likely say
for best performance,

1560
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:21,200
like if you want to fight at your best,

1561
00:42:21,201 --> 00:42:22,460
you should have it as high as possible.

1562
00:42:22,461 --> 00:42:26,840
So take your injection right before your
way in or something along those lines

1563
00:42:26,841 --> 00:42:28,760
and that way it'll be at
its peak the next day.

1564
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:31,950
Or even if you're used to getting a shot
on Monday and you're flying out to the

1565
00:42:31,951 --> 00:42:32,661
client on Tuesday,

1566
00:42:32,661 --> 00:42:34,730
you do a daily can fuck with the results.

1567
00:42:34,731 --> 00:42:36,270
You've seen that nate's not used to it.

1568
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:36,960
Yeah,

1569
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,160
but the point is that like
when he was at the peak,

1570
00:42:40,161 --> 00:42:44,380
like whatever it's peak was that if that
was normal that he was taken at that

1571
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:44,671
level,

1572
00:42:44,671 --> 00:42:46,040
like that's not even human.

1573
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,113
Like these are high,

1574
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:51,860
what you call hyper human levels with
doctors refer to as a hyper human level.

1575
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:54,410
So you get to certain levels like 15,

1576
00:42:54,411 --> 00:42:56,360
1600 and you're like Jesus Christ,

1577
00:42:56,361 --> 00:42:58,320
you go into those freak
bodybuilder levels.

1578
00:42:58,930 --> 00:43:01,460
What are the real pillars
that those guys want to go?

1579
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:02,510
They're not even human.

1580
00:43:02,770 --> 00:43:04,220
They take so much growth.

1581
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,233
They're not there.

1582
00:43:05,370 --> 00:43:10,370
They're so ridiculously muscular and
so just overwhelmingly cartoonishly

1583
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:12,253
powerful.

1584
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:14,230
Like you look at just dry age.

1585
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,330
They get addicted to that man and I look
at those guys and I think what's the

1586
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,570
end of the road like for those guys?

1587
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:22,630
Like how long can you run it at that?

1588
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:24,890
I think you just get fat after awhile.

1589
00:43:24,930 --> 00:43:25,071
No,

1590
00:43:25,071 --> 00:43:25,251
no.

1591
00:43:25,251 --> 00:43:26,060
Look it up.

1592
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:26,601
No located,

1593
00:43:26,601 --> 00:43:26,930
uh,

1594
00:43:26,930 --> 00:43:27,471
what's his face?

1595
00:43:27,471 --> 00:43:28,400
Homeboy from England.

1596
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:30,720
A dorian yates is one
of the best of all time.

1597
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:31,910
He's in his fifties now.

1598
00:43:31,911 --> 00:43:33,110
He's fit healthy.

1599
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:34,063
He looks thick.

1600
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:34,851
It was thick.

1601
00:43:34,851 --> 00:43:35,490
Like you,

1602
00:43:35,490 --> 00:43:36,920
he's not thick like freakish.

1603
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:38,240
He's thick like an athlete,

1604
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:39,200
you know,

1605
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:39,740
he looks,

1606
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:40,221
he looks good,

1607
00:43:40,221 --> 00:43:40,630
man.

1608
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:40,860
Hey,

1609
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:42,080
he's super open about it.

1610
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:43,610
Talks about all the shitty took,

1611
00:43:43,850 --> 00:43:45,200
talks about what everybody does.

1612
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:45,621
I mean,

1613
00:43:45,621 --> 00:43:49,070
he's super open about it to tells
you exactly what his dosage were.

1614
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:49,691
He wasn't,

1615
00:43:49,691 --> 00:43:49,821
you know,

1616
00:43:49,821 --> 00:43:51,260
there wasn't any higher than anybody else,

1617
00:43:51,490 --> 00:43:55,970
but he also highlights that
the reason why he got so good,

1618
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,060
the reason why he was Mr Olympia was
he was willing to fucking work harder.

1619
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:00,260
Like it wasn't just the drop.

1620
00:44:00,261 --> 00:44:00,411
No,

1621
00:44:00,411 --> 00:44:01,244
they're all in June.

1622
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:01,840
There.

1623
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:02,690
There's a difference.

1624
00:44:02,691 --> 00:44:03,560
It's a work ethic.

1625
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:04,633
However,

1626
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:05,480
not a sport,

1627
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:06,140
not a sport,

1628
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:07,060
not a spectator sport.

1629
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:07,970
It's something different.

1630
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:09,230
It's hard to put it,

1631
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:09,490
you know,

1632
00:44:09,490 --> 00:44:10,580
like how can you say that?

1633
00:44:10,581 --> 00:44:11,740
That is like boxing.

1634
00:44:11,810 --> 00:44:12,680
Boxing is a sport.

1635
00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:13,850
Soccer as a sport,

1636
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:14,743
you're trying to win,

1637
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:15,290
right?

1638
00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:19,250
You're trying to do something faster and
move quicker when you don't move like

1639
00:44:19,251 --> 00:44:19,471
your,

1640
00:44:19,471 --> 00:44:22,010
your whole thing is
standing still is your shit.

1641
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:23,900
Your shit is desk standing still.

1642
00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:25,503
It's um,

1643
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:26,300
it's,

1644
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:27,230
it's an art form.

1645
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:29,510
It's not one that I'm really into,

1646
00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:32,040
like you know that when you think about

1647
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:32,290
it,

1648
00:44:32,290 --> 00:44:33,480
it's pretty homosexual,

1649
00:44:33,481 --> 00:44:33,751
man.

1650
00:44:33,751 --> 00:44:36,680
It's other dudes judging body Nigga.

1651
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:37,561
You know what man?

1652
00:44:37,561 --> 00:44:37,801
It's.

1653
00:44:37,801 --> 00:44:38,281
There's A.

1654
00:44:38,281 --> 00:44:39,990
There's definitely a
little weirdness to it.

1655
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,280
I wouldn't say homosexual.

1656
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:42,143
It's a.

1657
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:42,870
What would you say?

1658
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:43,800
Congratulatory.

1659
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:45,083
That something.

1660
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:46,280
Something silly,

1661
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:47,113
but I see my boy,

1662
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:48,640
my boy,

1663
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:49,473
Kai Greene,

1664
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:51,730
some shit that he did to make ends meet.

1665
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:53,793
I'm

1666
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:56,130
preparing myself.

1667
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:57,480
Oh No.

1668
00:44:58,820 --> 00:44:59,340
What are you looking for,

1669
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:00,160
brother?

1670
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:00,360
Yeah,

1671
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:01,270
they go grab something,

1672
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:01,620
man.

1673
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:01,801
Yeah,

1674
00:45:01,801 --> 00:45:02,251
I'll take one.

1675
00:45:02,251 --> 00:45:02,610
Thank you.

1676
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:02,770
Yeah.

1677
00:45:02,770 --> 00:45:03,241
Kai Greene.

1678
00:45:03,241 --> 00:45:05,730
Who y'all taking care of brother?

1679
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:07,470
Oh,

1680
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:08,490
he did not call me Robbo.

1681
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:09,150
Brendan,

1682
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:10,110
before we get going on.

1683
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:14,250
Thanks to Grillo's Grillo's
pickles for hooking us up again.

1684
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:15,480
Those are the best.

1685
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:16,010
They're the.

1686
00:45:16,010 --> 00:45:16,621
They're the shit.

1687
00:45:16,621 --> 00:45:17,250
He's his.

1688
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:18,240
He's growing now.

1689
00:45:18,241 --> 00:45:20,490
He's selling them in whole
foods and all over the place.

1690
00:45:20,491 --> 00:45:21,120
Horse.

1691
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:21,780
Delicious.

1692
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:22,920
I met this dude and

1693
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,110
this dude in a.

1694
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:26,580
sorry.

1695
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:29,040
I met this dude in a park in Boston.

1696
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:31,020
He was in the park.

1697
00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:35,430
I was filming this scene in a movie with
Kevin James and some dude had a pickle

1698
00:45:35,431 --> 00:45:37,080
cart and not thank you brother.

1699
00:45:37,450 --> 00:45:38,820
And I was like a pickle car.

1700
00:45:38,830 --> 00:45:40,380
Blue Fuck has a pickle cart.

1701
00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:41,780
So I walked up to the.

1702
00:45:42,290 --> 00:45:42,450
Yeah,

1703
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:43,021
it was pretty cool.

1704
00:45:43,021 --> 00:45:43,290
I was like,

1705
00:45:43,290 --> 00:45:44,160
that's pretty interesting.

1706
00:45:44,161 --> 00:45:44,341
He goes,

1707
00:45:44,341 --> 00:45:44,491
yeah,

1708
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:45,390
would you like a sample?

1709
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:46,201
He was smart,

1710
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:46,590
man.

1711
00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:47,880
They're pickles are so fucking good.

1712
00:45:47,970 --> 00:45:49,290
He's just handing out pickles.

1713
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,040
And we were like,

1714
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:50,880
Oh shit.

1715
00:45:50,910 --> 00:45:52,030
He's very clever man.

1716
00:45:52,031 --> 00:45:52,420
This shit.

1717
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:54,340
So I do a show at um,

1718
00:45:54,530 --> 00:45:54,930
uh,

1719
00:45:54,930 --> 00:45:59,430
the Wilbur theater and dude gave out
free pickles instead of like selling

1720
00:45:59,431 --> 00:46:00,110
pickles.

1721
00:46:00,110 --> 00:46:02,780
They do just gave out free pickles in the,

1722
00:46:02,781 --> 00:46:02,960
uh,

1723
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:03,793
in the lobby.

1724
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:05,380
Like just giving people pickle.

1725
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:08,160
Guerrilla marketing can become an addict.

1726
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:09,870
They're so good and you're healthy.

1727
00:46:09,871 --> 00:46:10,470
Delicious.

1728
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:11,700
Pickles are good for you.

1729
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:14,290
They're like one of those
weird snacks where you're,

1730
00:46:14,370 --> 00:46:16,850
it's okay to eat bad about it.

1731
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:18,361
You know,

1732
00:46:18,361 --> 00:46:19,194
the pickle juice,

1733
00:46:19,830 --> 00:46:23,910
I want to have sugar in them.

1734
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:27,240
But the pickle juice people
drink for electrolytes.

1735
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:28,770
We used to have it on the sidelines.

1736
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:29,633
This is um,

1737
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:31,740
this is the tyrone tyron Woodley.

1738
00:46:31,741 --> 00:46:32,730
Johny Hendricks fight.

1739
00:46:32,970 --> 00:46:33,450
Didn't,

1740
00:46:33,450 --> 00:46:36,120
didn't woodley say that
Johnny Hendricks bit him.

1741
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:38,490
Denise say bit him or some shit.

1742
00:46:38,850 --> 00:46:39,180
He.

1743
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:40,013
Oh,

1744
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:41,063
face.

1745
00:46:41,370 --> 00:46:41,731
But see,

1746
00:46:41,731 --> 00:46:42,421
you know my band.

1747
00:46:42,421 --> 00:46:44,670
That's like a frozen moment in time.

1748
00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:48,270
It's real hard unless you see the actual
video of what it looked like when the

1749
00:46:48,271 --> 00:46:51,480
hand made contact with the face because
everybody knows that like in the middle

1750
00:46:51,481 --> 00:46:52,930
of a crazy grappling censorship,

1751
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:55,980
occasionally a hand will go
where it's not supposed to go.

1752
00:46:56,010 --> 00:46:57,530
Who gives a shit if you can kind of shape.

1753
00:46:57,531 --> 00:46:57,931
He is in.

1754
00:46:57,931 --> 00:46:58,764
Wow.

1755
00:46:58,830 --> 00:47:02,070
You'll throw both in amazing
shape on both amazing fighters.

1756
00:47:02,410 --> 00:47:03,420
It's a really interesting fight.

1757
00:47:03,421 --> 00:47:03,840
Man.

1758
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:06,690
Woodley is a training a lot now with.

1759
00:47:06,691 --> 00:47:08,340
I'm a duke.

1760
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,970
Duke roufus help is striking out.

1761
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:13,100
That's his biggest profits
is striking really well.

1762
00:47:13,210 --> 00:47:14,820
I wouldn't say it's this problem.

1763
00:47:14,821 --> 00:47:15,654
I think he's,

1764
00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:17,070
I think his,

1765
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:22,670
he's almost got like too much of a gift
in his power and speed and when you use

1766
00:47:23,251 --> 00:47:24,060
that gift,

1767
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:25,920
you know he can do shit
like the way he can move.

1768
00:47:25,921 --> 00:47:28,350
He can move as fast as anybody
through faster than anybody,

1769
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:30,130
but that requires a lot

1770
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:31,680
of energy and you gotta
know when to do it,

1771
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:32,620
when not to too long.

1772
00:47:33,030 --> 00:47:33,610
Yeah,

1773
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:34,720
so I think he has,

1774
00:47:34,721 --> 00:47:35,411
because of that,

1775
00:47:35,411 --> 00:47:35,940
he has a.

1776
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:39,370
it's compared to a guy who doesn't
have that kind of horsepower.

1777
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:42,190
He has a like a unique situation.

1778
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:42,700
We have to.

1779
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:47,620
He has to figure out when to sprint and
when to lay back and I think you saw way

1780
00:47:47,621 --> 00:47:51,070
more than the Calvin Gaslin fight and
that was a fight that he worked with Duke.

1781
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,660
Duke is like such a smart,

1782
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:56,440
polished striker that I think tyra
can only get better training with him,

1783
00:47:56,441 --> 00:47:57,490
but at the end of the day,

1784
00:47:57,670 --> 00:47:59,610
what's scary about that
dude is always that,

1785
00:47:59,790 --> 00:48:01,030
that fucking bum rush,

1786
00:48:01,031 --> 00:48:01,331
man.

1787
00:48:01,331 --> 00:48:01,511
See,

1788
00:48:01,511 --> 00:48:03,940
I think that's what he
has to do with Woodley.

1789
00:48:03,941 --> 00:48:04,511
I don't think he say,

1790
00:48:04,511 --> 00:48:04,841
hey man,

1791
00:48:04,841 --> 00:48:07,540
let's drag this into rounds and
try and be Johnny Hendricks.

1792
00:48:07,570 --> 00:48:08,250
You ain't gonna beat.

1793
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:09,011
You know what I think?

1794
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:09,800
I think you.

1795
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:11,110
You get better at everything.

1796
00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:11,981
I think that's it.

1797
00:48:11,981 --> 00:48:12,910
I don't think like saying,

1798
00:48:12,911 --> 00:48:13,091
Hey,

1799
00:48:13,091 --> 00:48:14,530
the only way you can win this is a sprint.

1800
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:17,890
I think that guy is getting better and
I think they're all think you can up his

1801
00:48:17,891 --> 00:48:19,270
cardio 100 percent.

1802
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:20,740
I really changes his approach.

1803
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:22,270
Changes his approach.

1804
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:25,880
Just slightly be a little bit
more efficient and you know,

1805
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:27,560
just know when to sprint when night.

1806
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:29,140
And I think that comes
with experience too.

1807
00:48:29,141 --> 00:48:29,760
Don't agree.

1808
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:30,730
He has a lot of fights though.

1809
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:31,780
It does have a lot of fights,

1810
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:32,650
but you know,

1811
00:48:32,650 --> 00:48:34,090
coming into it as a wrestler,

1812
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:36,430
when you think about the actual
amount of strikelee here,

1813
00:48:36,431 --> 00:48:36,821
you seem like,

1814
00:48:36,821 --> 00:48:39,400
look how fast fuck Jesus fucking monster.

1815
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:42,550
I think when you look at his
actual striking experience though,

1816
00:48:42,551 --> 00:48:45,580
it's not nearly as much as
say his grappling experience.

1817
00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:46,420
One hundred percent,

1818
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:46,721
you know,

1819
00:48:46,721 --> 00:48:48,600
so he's got to catch up and certain what?

1820
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:49,570
That was a crazy fight.

1821
00:48:49,690 --> 00:48:50,523
Him contact.

1822
00:48:50,530 --> 00:48:51,363
Jesus cried.

1823
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:52,181
That was the big one.

1824
00:48:52,181 --> 00:48:53,290
The J here on fight.

1825
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:54,400
That was the one where you say,

1826
00:48:54,401 --> 00:48:55,141
Jesus,

1827
00:48:55,141 --> 00:48:56,520
if this to his bum rushes you,

1828
00:48:56,521 --> 00:48:58,600
you gotTa fucking terrifying problem.

1829
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,900
But then it didn't work in
the Rory Macdonald Fight,

1830
00:49:02,050 --> 00:49:06,100
Rory Macdonald figured out a way how to
solve the riddle that is that big right

1831
00:49:06,101 --> 00:49:06,440
hand.

1832
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:09,670
And the bum rush kept his
hands up high and did that.

1833
00:49:09,671 --> 00:49:09,791
Uh,

1834
00:49:09,791 --> 00:49:10,091
the,

1835
00:49:10,091 --> 00:49:10,201
the,

1836
00:49:10,201 --> 00:49:11,620
the extension thing with his arms,

1837
00:49:11,621 --> 00:49:14,050
he's thrown a lot of jams going
to drag in the later rounds.

1838
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:14,291
Well,

1839
00:49:14,291 --> 00:49:16,330
rory avoided all the craziness.

1840
00:49:17,050 --> 00:49:17,621
Craziness.

1841
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:18,070
Very,

1842
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:18,580
very.

1843
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:20,390
That's Ross do of Rasa.

1844
00:49:20,430 --> 00:49:20,920
Hobbies,

1845
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:22,230
a wizard east.

1846
00:49:22,350 --> 00:49:23,500
Every seat is breakdowns.

1847
00:49:23,501 --> 00:49:27,430
He breaks down fights and talks about
technique and why guys are good at.

1848
00:49:27,450 --> 00:49:29,890
He's one of my favorite casino
as far as MMA coaches go.

1849
00:49:29,890 --> 00:49:30,723
He's number one.

1850
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,720
He's the best I've ever been mad.

1851
00:49:32,830 --> 00:49:33,251
He was pretty.

1852
00:49:33,251 --> 00:49:34,330
God damn good too.

1853
00:49:34,390 --> 00:49:35,380
He's revolutionizing,

1854
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:37,000
revolutionizing,

1855
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:40,050
revolutionizing guard point.

1856
00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:40,610
Yeah.

1857
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:41,180
Yeah.

1858
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:42,990
I still think about his guys,

1859
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:45,910
GSP now and then Roy Mcdonald.

1860
00:49:45,970 --> 00:49:47,200
He's had those guys since day one.

1861
00:49:47,530 --> 00:49:47,681
Well,

1862
00:49:47,681 --> 00:49:50,140
there's a few guys right now that
I think they're all in the mix.

1863
00:49:50,141 --> 00:49:52,770
I think you're born mark
Henry's in the mix for sure.

1864
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:53,500
For sure.

1865
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:55,150
He's so underrated that guy,

1866
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:56,170
but he's all striking.

1867
00:49:57,490 --> 00:50:00,490
It's so ridiculous.

1868
00:50:00,491 --> 00:50:03,700
Kickboxers great blocks or I'm just
talking about like straight MMA.

1869
00:50:03,701 --> 00:50:06,640
Coach Monster Wrestle in college too.

1870
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:08,213
He did something,

1871
00:50:08,230 --> 00:50:09,100
but you know what dude?

1872
00:50:09,101 --> 00:50:10,300
How do you fuck with Matt Hume?

1873
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:10,721
I mean,

1874
00:50:10,721 --> 00:50:11,980
look at Matt Hume's best student.

1875
00:50:11,981 --> 00:50:13,480
His best student is pound for pound.

1876
00:50:13,481 --> 00:50:18,310
The best guy on the planet earth today
made my mouth may be fighting my maybe

1877
00:50:18,311 --> 00:50:21,040
fighting guys that are small
and they may be sued or not.

1878
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:23,710
Not the same sort of a talent pool,

1879
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:26,410
but you can't tell me John
Dodson is a mother fucker.

1880
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:27,050
That mother fucker.

1881
00:50:27,050 --> 00:50:30,590
John Dodson is a Goddamn
motherfucker and mighty mouse.

1882
00:50:30,591 --> 00:50:35,591
Shut him down and did so in the most
efficient and impressive way I've ever

1883
00:50:35,841 --> 00:50:36,120
seen.

1884
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:37,510
Mighty mouse is terribly got here.

1885
00:50:37,511 --> 00:50:38,310
It's not my number one,

1886
00:50:38,310 --> 00:50:38,810
top five.

1887
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:39,110
Okay,

1888
00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:39,381
well,

1889
00:50:39,381 --> 00:50:39,710
you know,

1890
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:40,543
it's all subjective.

1891
00:50:40,630 --> 00:50:41,300
I agree,

1892
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:42,380
but he's my number one.

1893
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:43,310
I think he's the best.

1894
00:50:43,430 --> 00:50:47,600
So and you watch mad human him work
together and you watch all the strategy

1895
00:50:47,601 --> 00:50:50,930
that's involved and other thinking
and all the technique and the work.

1896
00:50:51,470 --> 00:50:52,010
He's a mother.

1897
00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:52,821
Those two guys,

1898
00:50:52,821 --> 00:50:53,060
man,

1899
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:54,260
you want to have a super team.

1900
00:50:54,261 --> 00:50:55,790
Jesus Christ for Rasa.

1901
00:50:55,791 --> 00:50:57,620
Hobby and Matt Hume on the same team.

1902
00:50:57,621 --> 00:50:57,711
Well,

1903
00:50:57,711 --> 00:51:01,340
what's impressive with Matt Hume is
at that at the La lighter weight.

1904
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:04,060
You have to be good at fucking everything.

1905
00:51:04,070 --> 00:51:04,670
No holes,

1906
00:51:04,670 --> 00:51:06,650
no zero holes and mighty mouse has that.

1907
00:51:06,650 --> 00:51:07,130
He's going to.

1908
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:08,480
He's a black belt and everything.

1909
00:51:08,481 --> 00:51:09,410
Worldclass and everything.

1910
00:51:09,470 --> 00:51:10,191
He saw so,

1911
00:51:10,191 --> 00:51:12,860
so fucking sneaky man.

1912
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:15,530
He's so sneaky like going.

1913
00:51:15,531 --> 00:51:19,900
He's when he's moving on those dudes like
when I'm watching him move on dots and

1914
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:24,410
I'm like this motherfucker in his foot
work like it's never the same beat.

1915
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:25,341
You know what I'm saying?

1916
00:51:25,341 --> 00:51:27,590
It's not like one to one,

1917
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:28,100
two,

1918
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:28,933
one to.

1919
00:51:29,050 --> 00:51:29,510
There's,

1920
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:34,190
there's all this sporadic shit that your
brain has to try to process and that's

1921
00:51:34,191 --> 00:51:35,840
something that for Ross
has talked about too,

1922
00:51:35,841 --> 00:51:40,841
like overloading a dude's
mind with possibilities and
I think for us it's really

1923
00:51:41,241 --> 00:51:42,770
the only guy I've ever heard articulated,

1924
00:51:42,890 --> 00:51:44,840
but you can see it in the
movements of mighty mouse.

1925
00:51:44,841 --> 00:51:46,850
That's clearly what
they're trying to initiate,

1926
00:51:46,851 --> 00:51:47,091
Bro.

1927
00:51:47,091 --> 00:51:49,220
Let's talk about Chris
Weidman needs to do something.

1928
00:51:49,310 --> 00:51:50,240
Mighty mouse.

1929
00:51:50,241 --> 00:51:52,090
We gotta figure something out.

1930
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:55,430
Something we'd a gimmick.

1931
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:57,560
I don't know if he comes in with a Cape.

1932
00:51:58,580 --> 00:51:59,630
We got to do something,

1933
00:51:59,631 --> 00:51:59,961
man.

1934
00:51:59,961 --> 00:52:00,110
No,

1935
00:52:00,110 --> 00:52:00,291
man,

1936
00:52:00,291 --> 00:52:01,490
I got to figure something out.

1937
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:04,310
I just hope if we keep talking about
on people eventually figured it out.

1938
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:06,110
I don't think for mighty mouse.

1939
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:09,320
Maybe Henry Cejudo who knows a big fight,

1940
00:52:09,321 --> 00:52:11,390
but now Henry so who says
he won't fight in Vegas?

1941
00:52:11,410 --> 00:52:14,060
[inaudible] and Nick Diaz
and he don't smoke weed.

1942
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:15,260
He doesn't even smoke weed,

1943
00:52:15,261 --> 00:52:17,300
but if for him it's a matter of principle.

1944
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:19,490
If all every UFC fighter should do this,

1945
00:52:19,491 --> 00:52:20,750
you want to make a fucking change.

1946
00:52:20,810 --> 00:52:21,201
Just say,

1947
00:52:21,201 --> 00:52:21,381
hey,

1948
00:52:21,381 --> 00:52:22,440
we're not fighting in Vegas.

1949
00:52:22,450 --> 00:52:22,911
I'll change it.

1950
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:23,241
You think?

1951
00:52:23,241 --> 00:52:23,871
Or they'll just say,

1952
00:52:23,871 --> 00:52:24,470
I think they would.

1953
00:52:24,470 --> 00:52:25,191
There's so much money.

1954
00:52:25,191 --> 00:52:26,150
You think they're going to change it?

1955
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,073
I think.

1956
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:28,610
I think they're going to lose the lawsuit.

1957
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:29,390
First of all,

1958
00:52:29,390 --> 00:52:30,800
I'm pretty sure that for real,

1959
00:52:30,810 --> 00:52:31,670
that they're going to go,

1960
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:31,811
oh,

1961
00:52:31,811 --> 00:52:32,450
100 percent.

1962
00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:33,530
They can't let this happen.

1963
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:34,130
The key,

1964
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:34,671
and by the way,

1965
00:52:34,671 --> 00:52:37,910
they've already lost when they had
a lifetime ban on vandelay Silva,

1966
00:52:37,970 --> 00:52:38,803
they lost that.

1967
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:39,950
You can't do that.

1968
00:52:39,951 --> 00:52:42,080
You can't give a guy a lifetime ban.

1969
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:46,370
You can't callously take away a man's
livelihood when he didn't even test

1970
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:47,150
positive.

1971
00:52:47,150 --> 00:52:47,670
I agree.

1972
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:49,190
Vandelay didn't.

1973
00:52:49,290 --> 00:52:51,590
You didn't do the right
thing by avoiding the task.

1974
00:52:51,591 --> 00:52:52,220
He brought it up.

1975
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:52,760
He ran.

1976
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:53,180
We don't.

1977
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:54,440
We don't know what he was on.

1978
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:55,910
We don't know what the situation was.

1979
00:52:55,970 --> 00:52:56,990
We know what he said.

1980
00:52:57,230 --> 00:52:57,620
Okay.

1981
00:52:57,620 --> 00:52:58,453
We're just.

1982
00:52:58,540 --> 00:52:59,720
But all I'm saying is we lay it out.

1983
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:02,030
You have to punish them for sure.

1984
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:02,900
Right.

1985
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:04,700
There has to be some sort of punishment,

1986
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:09,740
but the idea of taking away the man's
livelihood as a punishment for escaping a

1987
00:53:09,741 --> 00:53:13,310
drug test that if he was positive
for would only get at the time,

1988
00:53:13,311 --> 00:53:15,680
I think it was a nine month
suspension that was mandatory.

1989
00:53:15,681 --> 00:53:16,280
Right?

1990
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:17,180
You can't do that.

1991
00:53:17,950 --> 00:53:18,950
That's a tyranny,

1992
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:19,521
don't you think?

1993
00:53:19,521 --> 00:53:23,150
Just these Fox who checked as
piss and blood of the baddest.

1994
00:53:23,151 --> 00:53:23,810
Sue's not planet,

1995
00:53:23,810 --> 00:53:25,650
just trying to flex their muscle.

1996
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,150
They go home at night like,

1997
00:53:27,151 --> 00:53:27,361
yeah,

1998
00:53:27,361 --> 00:53:28,171
he's banned for life.

1999
00:53:28,171 --> 00:53:29,070
I fuck that dude.

2000
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:29,341
Well,

2001
00:53:29,341 --> 00:53:29,971
you know what it is,

2002
00:53:29,971 --> 00:53:30,211
man.

2003
00:53:30,211 --> 00:53:32,280
I think it's the same problem
that we have with cops.

2004
00:53:32,281 --> 00:53:33,061
In a lot of ways.

2005
00:53:33,061 --> 00:53:33,400
It's a.

2006
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:37,290
It becomes a game of trying to win
because trying like when you hear about

2007
00:53:37,291 --> 00:53:42,291
prosecutors and when you hear about like
cops that are like hiding evidence and

2008
00:53:42,571 --> 00:53:46,650
prosecutors that are avoiding avoiding
evidence or they withdraw evidence that

2009
00:53:46,651 --> 00:53:50,250
shows that they're the person that
they're trying to convict may be innocent.

2010
00:53:50,251 --> 00:53:50,520
Yeah.

2011
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:51,390
You hear about those stories.

2012
00:53:51,391 --> 00:53:51,571
You go,

2013
00:53:51,571 --> 00:53:52,560
how could someone do that?

2014
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:53,470
It's an ego thing too.

2015
00:53:53,471 --> 00:53:55,590
That will also because
they want the score,

2016
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:56,453
they want to win.

2017
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:59,790
Why do people cheat when it
comes to like card games or pool?

2018
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:01,201
Why do they do there?

2019
00:54:01,201 --> 00:54:02,100
They do it because they want to.

2020
00:54:02,101 --> 00:54:05,310
When it becomes a score thing
and when you're arresting people,

2021
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,110
it becomes a score so fucked up,

2022
00:54:07,111 --> 00:54:07,800
man.

2023
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:08,450
Fucking place.

2024
00:54:08,450 --> 00:54:08,850
Think about.

2025
00:54:08,850 --> 00:54:11,160
Think about if all the
founders got together like,

2026
00:54:11,161 --> 00:54:13,680
you know what you want to treat
our boy nick Diaz like this.

2027
00:54:13,681 --> 00:54:14,910
We're not fucking fighting in Vegas,

2028
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:15,900
but the big dogs,

2029
00:54:15,930 --> 00:54:16,560
students,

2030
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:17,393
connor,

2031
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:18,360
Rhonda,

2032
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:22,050
fucking cane were like
until you change this,

2033
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:23,010
until he changes.

2034
00:54:23,011 --> 00:54:23,641
We're not coming.

2035
00:54:23,641 --> 00:54:24,540
They're mighty mouse.

2036
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,640
We see fucking change really,

2037
00:54:26,641 --> 00:54:27,270
really fast.

2038
00:54:27,270 --> 00:54:29,580
A lot of people were disappointed in
something mighty mouse had earlier this

2039
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:29,581
week.

2040
00:54:29,581 --> 00:54:29,970
I didn't really.

2041
00:54:29,970 --> 00:54:30,990
The said he would fight,

2042
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:32,420
but I didn't.

2043
00:54:32,470 --> 00:54:32,820
He was,

2044
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:34,440
there was a quote that
people were upset about,

2045
00:54:34,441 --> 00:54:35,550
a very particular quote.

2046
00:54:35,551 --> 00:54:36,180
Like,

2047
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:36,760
I don't,

2048
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:37,620
I don't remember what it was.

2049
00:54:37,621 --> 00:54:38,460
I don't know what it was.

2050
00:54:38,461 --> 00:54:38,821
I don't want to.

2051
00:54:38,821 --> 00:54:39,654
I wanna um,

2052
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:41,273
parents,

2053
00:54:41,370 --> 00:54:46,370
can we get my mouth on pr guy something
conor Mcgregor and is there some shit?

2054
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:48,510
I don't know what's wrong.

2055
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:51,930
What about that case where
those kids in paradise lost.

2056
00:54:51,930 --> 00:54:52,410
They get,

2057
00:54:52,410 --> 00:54:56,840
they get accused of murdering these boys
in the woods because they thought that

2058
00:54:57,030 --> 00:54:59,190
the dumb ass cops in the small town,

2059
00:54:59,191 --> 00:55:02,020
they thought it was a satanic
ritual because they're there.

2060
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,440
The animals would come
and make eat the balls.

2061
00:55:04,450 --> 00:55:06,780
And the documentary talking
about Dr. that documentary,

2062
00:55:06,781 --> 00:55:07,590
Paradise lost.

2063
00:55:07,590 --> 00:55:10,630
You got to see this and the animals
would eat the balls and the dicks.

2064
00:55:10,631 --> 00:55:13,050
So they thought that
these guys say tannic.

2065
00:55:13,230 --> 00:55:17,100
So they went to the high school and found
the goth kids and fucking prosecuted

2066
00:55:17,101 --> 00:55:17,430
that.

2067
00:55:17,430 --> 00:55:18,780
So what happened to the boys?

2068
00:55:18,870 --> 00:55:22,830
They were in jail for like 17 boys who
got their dicks eat and how they die.

2069
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:23,903
They ended up,

2070
00:55:24,210 --> 00:55:25,230
they got their ticks eat.

2071
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:26,940
Now they got murdered,

2072
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:27,691
they got murdered,

2073
00:55:27,691 --> 00:55:28,480
but they,

2074
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:31,860
they went after the goth kids
because it was a satanic murder.

2075
00:55:31,861 --> 00:55:32,011
When,

2076
00:55:32,011 --> 00:55:34,200
who knows who did it
that was ever convicted.

2077
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:34,530
They never,

2078
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:35,460
never found the guys.

2079
00:55:35,461 --> 00:55:36,040
But there's like,

2080
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:36,230
if,

2081
00:55:36,230 --> 00:55:37,350
when you look into the story,

2082
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:38,220
man,

2083
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:38,530
you,

2084
00:55:38,530 --> 00:55:39,780
you some shit.

2085
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:41,430
There's a deep dude.

2086
00:55:41,431 --> 00:55:42,270
It's three parts.

2087
00:55:42,271 --> 00:55:43,104
Paradise lost.

2088
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:44,400
Do they ever in jail?

2089
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:45,260
And they,

2090
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:45,800
they,

2091
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:46,200
they,

2092
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:46,801
they knew it.

2093
00:55:46,801 --> 00:55:50,280
And when they finally figured
out that they didn't do it,

2094
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,140
they decided to say,

2095
00:55:52,690 --> 00:55:53,670
um,

2096
00:55:53,790 --> 00:55:56,680
that was so much pressure with
the supreme court that they did.

2097
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:59,100
They didn't want to lose
so bad that they said,

2098
00:55:59,101 --> 00:55:59,490
hey,

2099
00:55:59,490 --> 00:56:00,840
we'll let you guys out
of prison right now.

2100
00:56:00,841 --> 00:56:02,160
But you got to admit that you did it.

2101
00:56:02,490 --> 00:56:03,090
Wow.

2102
00:56:03,090 --> 00:56:03,361
It was.

2103
00:56:03,361 --> 00:56:07,990
So they let them out instead of dragging
on and dragging on another coma years.

2104
00:56:08,550 --> 00:56:09,331
They let them out.

2105
00:56:09,331 --> 00:56:11,070
As long as they admitted that they did it.

2106
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:11,430
Yeah.

2107
00:56:11,430 --> 00:56:12,020
Oh my God.

2108
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:12,853
That's.

2109
00:56:13,310 --> 00:56:14,490
So they got them off the hook.

2110
00:56:14,491 --> 00:56:15,300
And then you let them out.

2111
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:15,930
They still want.

2112
00:56:15,930 --> 00:56:16,763
They got conviction.

2113
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:17,400
That was the most.

2114
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:18,630
That was the most important thing.

2115
00:56:19,230 --> 00:56:19,651
By the way,

2116
00:56:19,651 --> 00:56:21,930
George Group is in the middle of
fighting Mitchell cocky right now.

2117
00:56:21,931 --> 00:56:22,381
Four minutes.

2118
00:56:22,381 --> 00:56:23,920
Twenty two seconds into the first round.

2119
00:56:23,921 --> 00:56:24,040
It's

2120
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:25,300
a fucking scraps.

2121
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:26,910
I haven't seen George root fight night.

2122
00:56:26,911 --> 00:56:27,800
Grip it.

2123
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:29,920
Did I just miss something or the last.

2124
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:30,160
What?

2125
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:32,200
Did he have a fight after
the dominick Cruz fight?

2126
00:56:32,230 --> 00:56:32,461
Nah,

2127
00:56:32,461 --> 00:56:33,250
I don't think so.

2128
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:38,250
Dominick Cruz made him take
straightly case to just lay back.

2129
00:56:38,970 --> 00:56:39,600
Chill out.

2130
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:39,851
Fuck.

2131
00:56:39,851 --> 00:56:40,450
Just happened.

2132
00:56:40,450 --> 00:56:41,283
I hear you.

2133
00:56:41,790 --> 00:56:43,540
Crews came out like a willdabeast.

2134
00:56:43,830 --> 00:56:44,830
Tj dillashaw.

2135
00:56:44,831 --> 00:56:45,664
That's a fight.

2136
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:49,510
I hope he stays healthy and
hope it doesn't fall off.

2137
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:51,100
He's a beast dude.

2138
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:54,040
He came running and like some
sort of a wild animal at him.

2139
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:55,490
I mean that was what it was like.

2140
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:56,330
He was like,

2141
00:56:56,330 --> 00:56:58,140
fuck that warm like a Tasmania.

2142
00:56:58,141 --> 00:56:59,620
And I just went on Donald.

2143
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:00,493
Yeah.

2144
00:57:00,670 --> 00:57:00,881
Yeah.

2145
00:57:00,881 --> 00:57:01,541
And then after,

2146
00:57:01,541 --> 00:57:02,360
when I was talking to him,

2147
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:02,680
he's like,

2148
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:02,951
dude,

2149
00:57:02,951 --> 00:57:04,540
I barely remember the fight.

2150
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:05,380
You just saw red.

2151
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:08,850
He just went into the zone
like immediately into the sea.

2152
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:13,180
One of the things I like about dominick
specifically is the way he thinks about

2153
00:57:13,181 --> 00:57:13,800
finding and you,

2154
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:13,991
you,

2155
00:57:13,991 --> 00:57:17,740
you see that when he does
the UFC analyst position,

2156
00:57:17,741 --> 00:57:20,820
when he starts talking about like
especially post-fight breakdowns,

2157
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:23,380
what guys did wrong and
I think he's really,

2158
00:57:23,590 --> 00:57:27,310
really aware of like
movement and technique very,

2159
00:57:27,311 --> 00:57:29,140
very on top of the sport,

2160
00:57:29,141 --> 00:57:29,710
you know,

2161
00:57:29,710 --> 00:57:30,311
constantly.

2162
00:57:30,311 --> 00:57:30,671
Yes.

2163
00:57:30,671 --> 00:57:34,360
Him and DC are probably the two smartest
guys I know about the sport as far as

2164
00:57:34,450 --> 00:57:36,040
current fighters in the sport.

2165
00:57:36,130 --> 00:57:38,920
You listen and Dominick
Cruz talk like Jesus Christ,

2166
00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:40,550
like he was helping chill up for,

2167
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:42,430
I forget who is going to fight,

2168
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:43,410
but uh,

2169
00:57:43,410 --> 00:57:46,280
we were working out together and he was
discussing these angles and his foot

2170
00:57:46,281 --> 00:57:46,560
work.

2171
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:46,840
I was like,

2172
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:48,160
Jesus Christ,

2173
00:57:48,470 --> 00:57:49,990
he's just his phd in footwork.

2174
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:50,141
Yeah,

2175
00:57:50,141 --> 00:57:54,220
he's a wizard and I think he opened up
a lot of guys eyes as to how frustrating

2176
00:57:54,221 --> 00:57:55,054
that shit was.

2177
00:57:55,690 --> 00:57:55,911
You know,

2178
00:57:55,911 --> 00:57:57,190
I think a lot of people,

2179
00:57:57,250 --> 00:57:57,611
well you know,

2180
00:57:57,611 --> 00:57:58,720
he's one of those fears,

2181
00:57:58,721 --> 00:57:59,510
these innovators,

2182
00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:00,311
these fighters.

2183
00:58:00,311 --> 00:58:02,770
It'll take like the steps and when they,

2184
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:05,440
when they take these steps
like you see everybody else go,

2185
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:06,333
oh,

2186
00:58:06,390 --> 00:58:07,223
copycat.

2187
00:58:07,390 --> 00:58:07,880
Sure,

2188
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:08,560
sure.

2189
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:08,711
Well,

2190
00:58:08,711 --> 00:58:09,431
as a sport,

2191
00:58:09,431 --> 00:58:10,840
I mean I think the sport is still,

2192
00:58:11,170 --> 00:58:11,621
first of all,

2193
00:58:11,621 --> 00:58:15,190
there's more variables I think in mixed
martial arts and there aren't any other

2194
00:58:15,191 --> 00:58:16,570
combat sport by far,

2195
00:58:16,571 --> 00:58:16,811
right?

2196
00:58:16,811 --> 00:58:21,610
We could easily agree to that and I think
that just the unique demands of combat

2197
00:58:21,611 --> 00:58:22,031
sports,

2198
00:58:22,031 --> 00:58:22,181
the,

2199
00:58:22,181 --> 00:58:25,840
the ability to keep your emotions in
check and to deal with getting your bell

2200
00:58:25,841 --> 00:58:26,560
rung,

2201
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:29,230
getting blasted while you're in
there and there's those variables.

2202
00:58:29,231 --> 00:58:29,800
There's so many.

2203
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:33,220
And then the different ways you can fight
the fact that you can take a fight to

2204
00:58:33,221 --> 00:58:33,791
the ground.

2205
00:58:33,791 --> 00:58:36,130
The fact that you have to avoid a
guy trying to take you to the ground.

2206
00:58:36,130 --> 00:58:38,110
The fact that while you're thinking
about the guy trying to take you to the

2207
00:58:38,111 --> 00:58:39,990
ground and punch you in the
face because you're looking for.

2208
00:58:40,030 --> 00:58:43,750
There's so many variables going on
that we're not even remotely done with.

2209
00:58:43,751 --> 00:58:45,820
Figuring out what's the
best way to do this thing.

2210
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,050
I don't know if we ever will.

2211
00:58:47,051 --> 00:58:50,050
I don't think we ever think it's
constantly evolving into a lot smaller.

2212
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:53,230
You don't have enough
time to master it all.

2213
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:56,080
There's so much to too many
techniques in Jujitsu to master.

2214
00:58:56,200 --> 00:59:00,640
You add the wrestling and then you had
the kickboxing and body type and body.

2215
00:59:00,650 --> 00:59:02,860
Certain body logic or your body.

2216
00:59:02,861 --> 00:59:03,370
Right.

2217
00:59:03,370 --> 00:59:04,210
Arguably the best.

2218
00:59:04,211 --> 00:59:04,480
Right?

2219
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:07,330
That's the best body for
the long strong guys.

2220
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:09,100
His strikings getting better.

2221
00:59:09,101 --> 00:59:09,550
Right.

2222
00:59:09,550 --> 00:59:10,383
How'd Gracie?

2223
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:11,613
It seems like,

2224
00:59:11,770 --> 00:59:12,820
I don't know if still fighting,

2225
00:59:12,821 --> 00:59:14,190
but the his last fight it.

2226
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:15,130
He Won.

2227
00:59:15,130 --> 00:59:16,420
And Chad,

2228
00:59:16,750 --> 00:59:18,880
we decide to stop doing mma.

2229
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:19,541
I think so,

2230
00:59:19,541 --> 00:59:19,691
yeah.

2231
00:59:19,691 --> 00:59:20,524
He's focused.

2232
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:21,410
Yeah.

2233
00:59:21,410 --> 00:59:24,020
I think he won his last fight
and then just said fuck it.

2234
00:59:24,050 --> 00:59:24,883
I think so.

2235
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:26,930
I'm not positive he retired,

2236
00:59:26,931 --> 00:59:28,010
but I know he's doing way more.

2237
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:31,010
Just seemed like a striking
was finally coming together.

2238
00:59:32,130 --> 00:59:34,030
Good footwork and good chap.

2239
00:59:34,190 --> 00:59:35,000
Good Duma.

2240
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:35,811
I'm a big fan.

2241
00:59:35,811 --> 00:59:37,220
I'm a fan of his Jujitsu too,

2242
00:59:37,370 --> 00:59:38,203
but you know who's.

2243
00:59:38,210 --> 00:59:40,100
Who impressed the shit out of me.

2244
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:41,810
And then Neil magnifiers,

2245
00:59:41,811 --> 00:59:42,644
Damien Maia.

2246
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:43,310
I was like,

2247
00:59:43,310 --> 00:59:44,690
Jesus Christ,

2248
00:59:44,691 --> 00:59:46,370
he's a Boa constrictor.

2249
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:46,821
He,

2250
00:59:46,821 --> 00:59:47,091
I mean,

2251
00:59:47,091 --> 00:59:48,770
I knew it from the rick story fight.

2252
00:59:49,010 --> 00:59:50,000
I saw in the rick story,

2253
00:59:50,001 --> 00:59:52,730
find them like this is like
a next level constrictor,

2254
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:53,150
you know,

2255
00:59:53,150 --> 00:59:54,980
especially when he gets down to one 70,

2256
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:57,950
he's a big ass one 70 at one 85.

2257
00:59:57,951 --> 00:59:59,270
He was like a good size.

2258
00:59:59,330 --> 01:00:00,500
It wasn't like undersized,

2259
01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:05,510
but at one 70 you can tell that with
his technique and then the strength and

2260
01:00:05,511 --> 01:00:09,880
leverage the long limbs advantage
that he's having God right now.

2261
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:11,030
Super tear,

2262
01:00:11,030 --> 01:00:14,030
but it's the way he took the back and
then when I talked to him about it

2263
01:00:14,031 --> 01:00:14,481
afterwards,

2264
01:00:14,481 --> 01:00:17,360
after the fight and he was talking about
the adjustments that he had to make to

2265
01:00:17,361 --> 01:00:21,460
get Neil Macanese back and to finish them
off because of how he was defending my

2266
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:21,950
disguise.

2267
01:00:21,950 --> 01:00:22,790
He's on a very,

2268
01:00:22,791 --> 01:00:23,690
very high level,

2269
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:25,313
high level.

2270
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:26,473
Thank God.

2271
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:27,221
I can't think of it.

2272
01:00:27,221 --> 01:00:28,150
Worst matchup for nail.

2273
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:30,710
Then Neil took that fight against
their Silva and then won that fight.

2274
01:00:30,711 --> 01:00:32,660
So back on track to Eric.

2275
01:00:32,661 --> 01:00:33,800
So if I was a good fight,

2276
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:34,320
it was.

2277
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:34,971
It was weird.

2278
01:00:34,971 --> 01:00:36,590
It was weird to see Eric
Silva look like that.

2279
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:37,030
Right?

2280
01:00:37,030 --> 01:00:37,530
Yeah.

2281
01:00:37,530 --> 01:00:41,060
A lot of people had questions
about the way he looked physically,

2282
01:00:41,630 --> 01:00:42,140
you know,

2283
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:42,590
I mean,

2284
01:00:42,590 --> 01:00:45,320
this is just something we're going to
have to deal with in the middle of this,

2285
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:47,690
this drug testing environment now,

2286
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:49,370
like everyone's under suspicion.

2287
01:00:49,370 --> 01:00:49,611
Right?

2288
01:00:49,611 --> 01:00:52,700
And when you come in and your body looks
radically different than it did before

2289
01:00:53,090 --> 01:00:54,740
and immediately people
are going to suspect,

2290
01:00:54,741 --> 01:00:56,510
don't you think people
have the right to suspect?

2291
01:00:56,540 --> 01:00:57,373
For sure.

2292
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:57,981
For sure.

2293
01:00:57,981 --> 01:00:59,020
Steroids and boxing.

2294
01:00:59,190 --> 01:00:59,550
Yeah.

2295
01:00:59,550 --> 01:00:59,880
Yeah.

2296
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:00,670
Seriously.

2297
01:01:00,670 --> 01:01:01,503
Yeah.

2298
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:03,300
Haven't figured out how to.

2299
01:01:03,730 --> 01:01:06,830
Boxing has been around for 7,000 years
and they haven't figured out how to keep

2300
01:01:06,831 --> 01:01:07,100
that.

2301
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:08,030
They don't give up together.

2302
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:08,651
They don't give them me.

2303
01:01:08,651 --> 01:01:09,590
Tell you something right now.

2304
01:01:09,591 --> 01:01:10,380
Let me tell you right now,

2305
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:15,380
the amount of testing that the UFC
fighters go through is above and beyond

2306
01:01:16,010 --> 01:01:18,620
anything you ever see ever in boxing.

2307
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:20,870
Ever get a floyd mayweather,

2308
01:01:20,871 --> 01:01:22,940
manny Pacquiao type situation where they.

2309
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:25,310
They agree to water testing,

2310
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:28,270
but even in that one we
found out that floyd took a.

2311
01:01:28,290 --> 01:01:28,920
An Ivy.

2312
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:29,560
Yeah,

2313
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:30,080
Bro.

2314
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:31,450
You're not allowed to take an IB.

2315
01:01:31,540 --> 01:01:35,300
That's boxing really under the U.

2316
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:39,740
S antidoping agency rules because you
can use an ivy and the ivy can mask the

2317
01:01:39,741 --> 01:01:41,450
use of any sort of steroid.

2318
01:01:41,450 --> 01:01:42,220
You're on,

2319
01:01:42,220 --> 01:01:42,560
Bro.

2320
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:44,900
You ever seen the vendor
holy field back in the day?

2321
01:01:44,990 --> 01:01:47,300
That was 30 Mr Olympia.

2322
01:01:47,301 --> 01:01:48,560
He's fucking Jack.

2323
01:01:48,590 --> 01:01:48,801
Well,

2324
01:01:48,801 --> 01:01:50,650
when he went up from positive,

2325
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:51,630
you think that's positive,

2326
01:01:51,650 --> 01:01:52,840
but he got linked to a,

2327
01:01:53,140 --> 01:01:53,630
uh,

2328
01:01:53,630 --> 01:01:56,900
a steroid clinic under the name like Boli.

2329
01:01:56,901 --> 01:01:58,370
Holyfield Tyson.

2330
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:00,140
He got fucked.

2331
01:02:00,140 --> 01:02:00,861
What about Tyson?

2332
01:02:00,861 --> 01:02:01,550
What do you think?

2333
01:02:01,550 --> 01:02:04,340
What do I think if I had to bet
my entire life savings on it?

2334
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:05,690
100 percent,

2335
01:02:05,691 --> 01:02:06,740
but I don't know for sure.

2336
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:07,160
Who knows?

2337
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:08,450
I know professional sports.

2338
01:02:08,540 --> 01:02:09,291
I'll tell you what though,

2339
01:02:09,291 --> 01:02:09,501
man.

2340
01:02:09,501 --> 01:02:10,910
When Tyson came out of jail,

2341
01:02:11,090 --> 01:02:13,340
remember when we saw Jack Tyson damage?

2342
01:02:13,390 --> 01:02:14,330
I could just crack George,

2343
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:15,350
but two big shots.

2344
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:16,910
You remember Jack Tyson?

2345
01:02:17,470 --> 01:02:18,110
Tyson fault.

2346
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:18,950
Was it Kevin Ferguson?

2347
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:20,650
Was that his first
opponent right out of jail.

2348
01:02:20,651 --> 01:02:22,120
Is that was his name Kevin something.

2349
01:02:22,820 --> 01:02:23,350
Ferguson.

2350
01:02:23,350 --> 01:02:23,940
That's right.

2351
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:24,391
Is that right?

2352
01:02:24,391 --> 01:02:24,541
Yeah,

2353
01:02:24,541 --> 01:02:24,870
that's right.

2354
01:02:24,870 --> 01:02:24,991
Like,

2355
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:27,120
it's wrong because there was an Irish guy,

2356
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:28,130
Tony Ferguson.

2357
01:02:28,130 --> 01:02:28,231
No,

2358
01:02:28,231 --> 01:02:28,460
no.

2359
01:02:28,460 --> 01:02:30,660
It was the Irish guy that he
fought the first time out of jail.

2360
01:02:31,460 --> 01:02:32,340
I want to say Jacob.

2361
01:02:32,370 --> 01:02:33,203
Brian's right.

2362
01:02:33,650 --> 01:02:35,210
Leader mcneely.

2363
01:02:35,220 --> 01:02:35,820
That's it.

2364
01:02:35,820 --> 01:02:36,201
Jacob.

2365
01:02:36,201 --> 01:02:37,440
Brian is the guy fought in the UFC.

2366
01:02:37,441 --> 01:02:37,921
What am I talking?

2367
01:02:37,921 --> 01:02:38,550
Too Much?

2368
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:38,791
Light.

2369
01:02:38,791 --> 01:02:39,150
Heavyweight.

2370
01:02:39,150 --> 01:02:39,983
Yeah.

2371
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:40,440
Yeah.

2372
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:41,150
Peter Mcnealy.

2373
01:02:41,150 --> 01:02:42,930
When when Tyson fought Peter mcneely,

2374
01:02:42,931 --> 01:02:43,230
diversity.

2375
01:02:43,230 --> 01:02:44,640
What he looked like from that fight.

2376
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:45,151
Jamie,

2377
01:02:45,151 --> 01:02:48,750
pull up a picture of Mike Tyson versus
Peter Mcneil like fresh out of prison.

2378
01:02:48,751 --> 01:02:50,130
He looked like a bodybuilder.

2379
01:02:50,510 --> 01:02:52,670
Look like a bodybuilder
that fight radical.

2380
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:55,170
Six pack fucking super buff.

2381
01:02:55,830 --> 01:02:57,840
So he was getting good nutrition in jail.

2382
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:02,900
It everyone gets swollen in jail for
fucking three square meals a day.

2383
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:05,400
Terrible food they give you apparently

2384
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:08,960
who the fuck would sign up for that fight?

2385
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,970
Tyson fighting Jon Jones out of,

2386
01:03:11,140 --> 01:03:12,080
out of jail or prison.

2387
01:03:12,110 --> 01:03:12,943
Enjoy that.

2388
01:03:12,950 --> 01:03:16,860
I know it's going to be a mother fucker
will also the amount of people that were

2389
01:03:16,861 --> 01:03:20,520
paying attention to that because they
felt like Mike Tyson got railroaded.

2390
01:03:20,820 --> 01:03:21,621
Like that was a,

2391
01:03:21,621 --> 01:03:22,170
uh,

2392
01:03:22,170 --> 01:03:24,390
that was a questionable decision.

2393
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:29,660
Like what had happened to him and the
lawyers sort of strategy for dealing with

2394
01:03:30,421 --> 01:03:31,110
the case.

2395
01:03:31,110 --> 01:03:32,790
Was that the girls should have known,

2396
01:03:33,060 --> 01:03:36,300
she should have known going into
a room that she should have known,

2397
01:03:36,301 --> 01:03:39,750
but also she should have known
because of the guy that Mike is like,

2398
01:03:39,751 --> 01:03:43,800
their strategy was to like make it
look like he was just a bad guy.

2399
01:03:43,830 --> 01:03:44,041
Look,

2400
01:03:44,041 --> 01:03:46,050
you should know he's out
there at Merck and dudes,

2401
01:03:46,230 --> 01:03:46,660
you know,

2402
01:03:46,660 --> 01:03:49,320
go watch them harvest
fraser fight and expect to.

2403
01:03:49,321 --> 01:03:50,700
What do you think's gonna happen
when you get alone with that,

2404
01:03:53,540 --> 01:03:55,880
that big old room.

2405
01:03:56,010 --> 01:03:57,840
And that was essentially their strategy,

2406
01:03:57,841 --> 01:04:01,750
a lawyer strategy and that
shit just didn't work this.

2407
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:05,620
But the girl had a.

2408
01:04:05,660 --> 01:04:10,660
apparently allegedly she had a false rape
accusation already before the Tyson's.

2409
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:12,073
What's her thing?

2410
01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:13,490
So it wasn't,

2411
01:04:13,550 --> 01:04:14,360
you know,

2412
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:15,020
look man,

2413
01:04:15,020 --> 01:04:15,853
some of these people

2414
01:04:16,370 --> 01:04:17,970
out there in this wild world of crazy.

2415
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:18,970
If you don't,

2416
01:04:19,150 --> 01:04:19,940
you never know.

2417
01:04:19,940 --> 01:04:21,950
If Joey Diaz was Mike Tyson's lawyer,

2418
01:04:22,050 --> 01:04:23,060
what would that sound like?

2419
01:04:23,170 --> 01:04:24,050
Listen Cock sucker.

2420
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:27,890
Everybody knows you're a
fucking creep banging bitches.

2421
01:04:27,891 --> 01:04:32,700
You showing you a giant thick to the
general public to plead the fifth,

2422
01:04:33,340 --> 01:04:33,830
plead the fifth.

2423
01:04:33,830 --> 01:04:34,970
I'm going to talk for you,

2424
01:04:35,990 --> 01:04:36,500
Mike.

2425
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:37,730
You're the baddest of all time.

2426
01:04:38,390 --> 01:04:40,420
We're going to get you out of this shit.

2427
01:04:42,460 --> 01:04:45,140
The fuck you gotta.

2428
01:04:45,420 --> 01:04:46,253
Read books.

2429
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:48,480
Get adult hands.

2430
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:52,150
Break out the fucking
interrupt your grandmother

2431
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:55,820
in a fucking hotel.

2432
01:04:55,821 --> 01:04:56,654
Rome.

2433
01:04:58,610 --> 01:04:59,690
You wait lobster,

2434
01:05:00,140 --> 01:05:00,973
lobster.

2435
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:08,960
Guarantee my bike Chris,

2436
01:05:09,110 --> 01:05:09,943
because you're my friend.

2437
01:05:11,750 --> 01:05:12,583
Come on.

2438
01:05:13,190 --> 01:05:15,170
So she claimed he just straight raped her.

2439
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:15,940
Um,

2440
01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:17,440
I don't know what the exact was,

2441
01:05:17,441 --> 01:05:19,690
but there was like,

2442
01:05:20,110 --> 01:05:22,740
I really shouldn't be saying even
saying what the evidence looks at.

2443
01:05:22,750 --> 01:05:23,583
Barely remember.

2444
01:05:23,710 --> 01:05:25,440
But there was something to the ics,

2445
01:05:25,540 --> 01:05:26,800
something similar to,

2446
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:29,200
she had come up to the room.

2447
01:05:29,201 --> 01:05:33,160
She had taken off her panties shield in
the bathroom and like they were saying

2448
01:05:33,161 --> 01:05:33,341
like,

2449
01:05:33,341 --> 01:05:35,200
that says that she was
getting ready for sex,

2450
01:05:35,350 --> 01:05:38,710
which doesn't necessarily mean that
could mean it was she needed anymore.

2451
01:05:38,711 --> 01:05:39,221
It was funky.

2452
01:05:39,221 --> 01:05:39,910
She took a leak.

2453
01:05:39,910 --> 01:05:41,380
She wanted to take it out of her vagina.

2454
01:05:41,381 --> 01:05:42,380
That's what the garbage is for,

2455
01:05:42,820 --> 01:05:43,360
you know,

2456
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:43,910
I don't know.

2457
01:05:43,910 --> 01:05:44,770
I don't have one of those.

2458
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:45,011
Yeah,

2459
01:05:45,011 --> 01:05:45,701
I don't know either,

2460
01:05:45,701 --> 01:05:46,534
but,

2461
01:05:46,660 --> 01:05:49,540
but so far there was no,

2462
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:51,070
I don't think there was anything,

2463
01:05:51,071 --> 01:05:51,730
um,

2464
01:05:51,730 --> 01:05:52,200
that,

2465
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:52,660
that,

2466
01:05:52,660 --> 01:05:53,493
you know,

2467
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:54,873
could have A.

2468
01:05:56,780 --> 01:05:59,420
I don't think there's anything that
could have been done while while it was

2469
01:05:59,421 --> 01:06:00,350
going on too,

2470
01:06:01,870 --> 01:06:02,703
to make it.

2471
01:06:03,070 --> 01:06:04,150
If you're not there,

2472
01:06:04,170 --> 01:06:04,480
right.

2473
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:05,201
To make it accurate.

2474
01:06:05,201 --> 01:06:05,950
If you're not there,

2475
01:06:05,950 --> 01:06:06,401
if you're.

2476
01:06:06,401 --> 01:06:08,020
If you're not the woman
or you're not the man.

2477
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:12,070
When you were describing something that
happens when someone's alleging that

2478
01:06:12,071 --> 01:06:12,904
someone raped you,

2479
01:06:13,210 --> 01:06:14,920
you Kinda fucked when you're Mike Tyson,

2480
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:17,140
you accused you of rape
because I can see it.

2481
01:06:17,141 --> 01:06:17,974
But did he do it?

2482
01:06:17,980 --> 01:06:18,760
I don't know man.

2483
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:22,420
I don't know either and I think that
whenever he did the court said he did and

2484
01:06:22,421 --> 01:06:23,254
they put them away.

2485
01:06:23,410 --> 01:06:25,960
He still says he didn't
know and I think like,

2486
01:06:26,110 --> 01:06:26,790
I don't know,

2487
01:06:26,790 --> 01:06:27,230
you know,

2488
01:06:27,230 --> 01:06:28,063
I don't know.

2489
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:29,440
There's,

2490
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:34,440
when you find out that someone had
already gotten off of a false rape

2491
01:06:34,451 --> 01:06:35,284
accusation,

2492
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:39,040
that doesn't necessarily mean
that they can't get raped still.

2493
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:39,933
You know what I mean?

2494
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:41,860
It could be crazy,

2495
01:06:41,861 --> 01:06:43,660
but it would be like crazy cry wolf,

2496
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:44,200
right?

2497
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:45,310
Bitches to be crazy.

2498
01:06:45,311 --> 01:06:48,860
But who knows what the original
circumstance was and she was really young,

2499
01:06:48,890 --> 01:06:49,723
super hot,

2500
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:50,290
super.

2501
01:06:50,290 --> 01:06:50,741
You never know.

2502
01:06:50,741 --> 01:06:52,870
Maybe she was dating some
other animal or something,

2503
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:53,771
but I'll tell you,

2504
01:06:53,771 --> 01:06:55,270
you're guilty right away,

2505
01:06:55,271 --> 01:06:56,940
especially in the public
if you're an athlete.

2506
01:06:57,190 --> 01:06:57,790
Big dudes.

2507
01:06:57,790 --> 01:06:58,361
Scary dude.

2508
01:06:58,361 --> 01:06:59,111
You're guilty.

2509
01:06:59,111 --> 01:06:59,350
Rather.

2510
01:06:59,350 --> 01:07:01,990
What the scariest boxer of all time.

2511
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:07,060
I mean he's Mike Tyson in his
prime was the all time of all time.

2512
01:07:07,090 --> 01:07:07,690
Hands down.

2513
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:11,020
No one came close when he would go
in there with that towel cutoff.

2514
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:12,510
No fucking socks off.

2515
01:07:12,540 --> 01:07:14,020
Kid is Christ.

2516
01:07:14,021 --> 01:07:14,854
He was a monster.

2517
01:07:15,790 --> 01:07:16,510
But uh,

2518
01:07:16,510 --> 01:07:16,900
anyway,

2519
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:18,070
who knows what the fuck happened?

2520
01:07:18,071 --> 01:07:18,850
That was my point.

2521
01:07:18,850 --> 01:07:19,241
But anyway,

2522
01:07:19,241 --> 01:07:20,140
when he got out of jail,

2523
01:07:20,830 --> 01:07:21,670
pull up that picture.

2524
01:07:21,671 --> 01:07:21,920

2526

Uh,

2527
01:07:24,530 --> 01:07:25,363
you were close.

2528
01:07:25,490 --> 01:07:26,323

And you see him dare you.

2533
01:07:31,810 --> 01:07:32,830

01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:34,960
President workout program,

2535

2537
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:36,040
Yeah,

2538
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:39,100
he's getting three square meals a day.

2539
01:07:39,890 --> 01:07:42,190
There's no Jesus.

2540
01:07:43,420 --> 01:07:44,231
Oh my God.

2541
01:07:44,231 --> 01:07:44,591

2542
01:07:44,591 --> 01:07:44,860

01:07:47,110 --> 01:07:48,370
Oh my God.

2545
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:50,960
Hey Tyson got prison officer pregnant.

2546
01:07:51,070 --> 01:07:51,851
Damn straight.

2547
01:07:51,851 --> 01:07:53,420
He did look at that fucking mom.

2548
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:54,790
I don't know.

2549
01:07:55,180 --> 01:07:56,560
That could be some bullshit.

TMZ.

2556
01:08:02,530 --> 01:08:03,520
I don't even want to read that.

2557
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:04,593
Of course he did

2558
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:06,821
go back to the photo.

2559
01:08:06,821 --> 01:08:07,061
Fuck.

2560
01:08:07,061 --> 01:08:07,811
I don't want to hear the story.

2561
01:08:07,811 --> 01:08:08,410
I don't even want to.

2562
01:08:08,410 --> 01:08:10,060
I want to give it the time of day.

2563
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:14,070
I want to admire his body
and he fucked a prison

2564
01:08:17,170 --> 01:08:19,060
rap videos like those Tupac,

2565
01:08:19,070 --> 01:08:19,670
right?

2566
01:08:19,670 --> 01:08:23,570
Wasn't that one or two back when I get
free dog where he was talking about the

2567
01:08:23,571 --> 01:08:23,931
girl,

2568
01:08:23,931 --> 01:08:24,764
the prison lady.

2569
01:08:24,940 --> 01:08:25,380
Look,

2570
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:28,040
the two guys who escaped the
prison earlier this year.

2571
01:08:28,070 --> 01:08:29,540
They were fucking the prison guard.

2572
01:08:29,570 --> 01:08:29,721
Yeah.

2573
01:08:29,721 --> 01:08:30,521
You can't have girls now.

2574
01:08:30,521 --> 01:08:32,480
You got a honey Dickerman and
given the keys to get out.

2575
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:34,640
I thought body on Tyson.

2576
01:08:34,641 --> 01:08:35,900
Jesus Christ.

2577
01:08:36,980 --> 01:08:38,470
If he could make it mean now that.

2578
01:08:38,580 --> 01:08:38,900
I mean,

2579
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:40,100
is that the optimum?

2580
01:08:40,101 --> 01:08:41,570
Look though when you're fighting,

2581
01:08:42,030 --> 01:08:42,351
we look out.

2582
01:08:42,351 --> 01:08:47,351
For him it was especially how it was for
that fight he provide mcnealy was out

2583
01:08:47,691 --> 01:08:52,340
of his league and other Japanese anime
where there's like a girls that are cops

2584
01:08:52,341 --> 01:08:55,450
and detectives going after criminals
and the criminals always fuck them.

2585
01:08:55,970 --> 01:08:56,630
You ever see that?

2586
01:08:56,630 --> 01:08:56,721
Oh,

2587
01:08:56,721 --> 01:08:57,650
that's hilarious.

2588
01:08:57,651 --> 01:08:59,060
I love it.

2589
01:08:59,061 --> 01:09:01,220
It's always going after them
and they almost catch them.

2590
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:01,820
They catch him.

2591
01:09:01,820 --> 01:09:05,080
He seduces or Fox or any
scapes and she's constantly,

2592
01:09:05,090 --> 01:09:05,540
you know,

2593
01:09:05,540 --> 01:09:06,373
that's gotTa happen,

2594
01:09:06,420 --> 01:09:07,030
right?

2595
01:09:07,030 --> 01:09:10,700
You see me cops and like super gangster
dudes who have tons of money and big

2596
01:09:10,701 --> 01:09:11,534
dicks.

2597
01:09:12,780 --> 01:09:13,030
Yeah,

2598
01:09:13,030 --> 01:09:13,730
yeah,

2599
01:09:13,730 --> 01:09:14,001
yeah.

2600
01:09:14,001 --> 01:09:17,430
Especially in those cartoons
are inspired by real event.

2601
01:09:17,431 --> 01:09:19,730
The situation like the
girl has to go on to cover

2602
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:22,201
and then,

2603
01:09:22,201 --> 01:09:22,490
you know,

2604
01:09:22,490 --> 01:09:23,450
Washington to cover.

2605
01:09:23,451 --> 01:09:24,470
She falls in love.

2606
01:09:25,150 --> 01:09:27,730
So I gotta try it,

2607
01:09:27,731 --> 01:09:28,550
you know,

2608
01:09:28,550 --> 01:09:31,770
she tries to pull the card
at the end of the rest of.

2609
01:09:31,771 --> 01:09:32,604
But she can't do it.

2610
01:09:33,140 --> 01:09:36,320
She does the same every.

2611
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:40,820
She almost has him and then he just
fucking talks her into sucking his dick.

2612
01:09:41,180 --> 01:09:43,070
What is weird?

2613
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:45,940
Japanese anime octopus's,

2614
01:09:46,250 --> 01:09:50,680
they'll have like octopuses are getting
fucked by like multiple armed animal

2615
01:09:52,390 --> 01:09:53,223
cartoon.

2616
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:54,061
This is a cartoon.

2617
01:09:54,061 --> 01:09:54,770
This is real life.

2618
01:09:54,770 --> 01:09:55,610
No enemy.

2619
01:09:55,650 --> 01:09:55,930
Right?

2620
01:09:55,930 --> 01:09:56,631
You know what I'm talking about,

2621
01:09:56,631 --> 01:09:57,464
right?

2622
01:09:58,300 --> 01:09:58,850
Why?

2623
01:09:58,850 --> 01:10:00,800
Why is that bus with?

2624
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:00,981
Yeah,

2625
01:10:00,981 --> 01:10:01,350
there's.

2626
01:10:01,350 --> 01:10:03,320
Is it just tentacles is a tentacle porn?

2627
01:10:03,321 --> 01:10:04,170
Is that what they call it?

2628
01:10:05,470 --> 01:10:06,303
Loves Sushi.

2629
01:10:06,460 --> 01:10:07,293
Funny because

2630
01:10:08,660 --> 01:10:11,690
for the last couple of days I've been
really into what's going on youtube and

2631
01:10:11,691 --> 01:10:16,250
just watching a intelligent octopus
documentaries and where they test their

2632
01:10:16,251 --> 01:10:17,030
intelligence.

2633
01:10:17,030 --> 01:10:22,030
Do you know that off the coast of
Washington they have a problem with.

2634
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:26,960
There are certain areas that they have a
problem with in the water where octopus

2635
01:10:26,961 --> 01:10:29,030
attack you and they got it on film,

2636
01:10:29,031 --> 01:10:31,200
like attacking these
divers and octopus man.

2637
01:10:31,230 --> 01:10:32,063
You heard of this?

2638
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:32,210
Well,

2639
01:10:32,210 --> 01:10:33,380
they're predatory you.

2640
01:10:33,381 --> 01:10:35,060
Have you ever seen the
video of the meeting sharks?

2641
01:10:35,630 --> 01:10:36,020
No.

2642
01:10:36,020 --> 01:10:36,261
Damn.

2643
01:10:36,261 --> 01:10:41,261
Like a giant squid who up the video of
octopus kills a shark because there was a

2644
01:10:41,751 --> 01:10:46,751
problem that they had with this aquarium
where these sharks were dying and they

2645
01:10:47,571 --> 01:10:51,260
thought that like someone was stealing
the sharks or they thought that maybe

2646
01:10:51,261 --> 01:10:53,870
like one of the other sharks
was killing the sharks.

2647
01:10:53,871 --> 01:10:55,340
They couldn't figure out
what the fuck was going on.

2648
01:10:55,970 --> 01:10:59,680
So they set up a camera and in the hidden
camera they found out that octopuses

2649
01:10:59,690 --> 01:11:01,820
are gangster as fuck.

2650
01:11:01,821 --> 01:11:02,061
Yeah.

2651
01:11:02,061 --> 01:11:03,150
They're so smart.

2652
01:11:03,260 --> 01:11:08,260
They hide in these rocks and they pretend
to be the color of the rock that could

2653
01:11:08,451 --> 01:11:11,320
change their color to look to
look like their background.

2654
01:11:11,321 --> 01:11:14,120
Like they camouflage themselves
and while there's sharks

2655
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:19,160
swimming by the octopus just fucking
explodes out and grabs him and eat him

2656
01:11:20,161 --> 01:11:20,710
alive.

2657
01:11:20,710 --> 01:11:22,230
It was one of those bullshit sharks so.

2658
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:22,831
Well,

2659
01:11:22,831 --> 01:11:23,850
it's a small shark,

2660
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:27,540
but it's just when you put these
motherfuckers in captivity,

2661
01:11:27,570 --> 01:11:29,850
the sharks don't give a shit
as long as they have food,

2662
01:11:30,180 --> 01:11:31,050
they're kind of dumb.

2663
01:11:31,410 --> 01:11:33,300
But octopuses are not dumb.

2664
01:11:33,330 --> 01:11:34,320
Octopus are smart.

2665
01:11:34,321 --> 01:11:34,740
It's fun.

2666
01:11:34,740 --> 01:11:36,380
I love a good Octopi.

2667
01:11:37,350 --> 01:11:40,590
Occupy might be one of my favorite
animals that actually captured on film.

2668
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:41,031
Yeah.

2669
01:11:41,031 --> 01:11:41,220
Yeah.

2670
01:11:41,220 --> 01:11:41,761
It's awesome.

2671
01:11:41,761 --> 01:11:42,421
He's about to Merck.

2672
01:11:42,421 --> 01:11:43,370
This fucking shit.

2673
01:11:43,850 --> 01:11:45,390
Once they knew that the.

2674
01:11:45,490 --> 01:11:46,830
The footage ain't that good.

2675
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:47,970
It's not bad dude.

2676
01:11:48,030 --> 01:11:50,640
Once they knew that the
octopus was doing this,

2677
01:11:50,641 --> 01:11:51,960
they set up all sorts of cameras.

2678
01:11:51,961 --> 01:11:53,380
You see how they edited the Shit?

2679
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:54,260
The edited.

2680
01:11:54,260 --> 01:11:54,751
I bet.

2681
01:11:54,751 --> 01:11:55,380
I mean this is.

2682
01:11:55,380 --> 01:11:56,850
That was probably taken three weeks.

2683
01:11:56,900 --> 01:11:57,720
We got to edit it.

2684
01:11:57,720 --> 01:11:57,840
Well,

2685
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:02,840
I think both both scenes are probably
bullshit stuff like all this stuff.

2686
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:05,910
This is like we gotta build the story,

2687
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:09,300
knows a little bit too
much about the business.

2688
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:12,560
You know too much about the time
I watch the discovery channel.

2689
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:13,830
How did they get the cameras?

2690
01:12:13,831 --> 01:12:14,470
All over the.

2691
01:12:14,470 --> 01:12:16,020
The weaving a story.

2692
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:19,580
How many cameras did get the
camera in the water like that?

2693
01:12:19,590 --> 01:12:21,940
Eddie Bravo can't watch a
fucking superhero movie.

2694
01:12:21,950 --> 01:12:22,231
It's like,

2695
01:12:22,231 --> 01:12:22,830
come on,

2696
01:12:22,830 --> 01:12:23,910
you know he's going to win.

2697
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:24,953
He always wins.

2698
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:25,290
Like,

2699
01:12:25,290 --> 01:12:26,011
why would you watch it?

2700
01:12:26,011 --> 01:12:27,210
If you know what's going
to happen at the end,

2701
01:12:27,330 --> 01:12:28,070
why would you watch it?

2702
01:12:28,070 --> 01:12:28,620
Do you know?

2703
01:12:28,620 --> 01:12:29,453
Do you think he's going to lose?

2704
01:12:29,460 --> 01:12:30,990
Did you think he was
going to die at the end?

2705
01:12:30,991 --> 01:12:31,321
Was over?

2706
01:12:31,321 --> 01:12:32,010
Were you shocked?

2707
01:12:32,010 --> 01:12:32,641
Were you surprised?

2708
01:12:32,641 --> 01:12:32,910
Like,

2709
01:12:32,910 --> 01:12:33,211
Whoa,

2710
01:12:33,211 --> 01:12:34,044
the good guy.

2711
01:12:34,110 --> 01:12:34,980
The good guy always wins.

2712
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:36,060
I want the bad guy to win.

2713
01:12:36,180 --> 01:12:36,961
Why can't the bad guy?

2714
01:12:36,961 --> 01:12:37,800
When I went to Baghdad,

2715
01:12:37,830 --> 01:12:39,180
when once I like Narcos,

2716
01:12:39,980 --> 01:12:41,490
I want to watch this.

2717
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:45,510
Is it got a little bit?

2718
01:12:45,930 --> 01:12:46,763
Yeah.

2719
01:12:46,780 --> 01:12:47,360
Yeah.

2720
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:48,690
They just squeeze the life out.

2721
01:12:49,270 --> 01:12:51,360
Jack will their tentacles,

2722
01:12:51,361 --> 01:12:51,900
man.

2723
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:52,733
They're tending.

2724
01:12:53,460 --> 01:12:55,470
Their tentacles are not
just strong as fuck,

2725
01:12:55,620 --> 01:12:58,410
but those suction cups have prongs.

2726
01:12:58,890 --> 01:13:01,200
They reach out and cleaning
and rip things apart.

2727
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:03,180
Like it's not a simple as like,

2728
01:13:03,181 --> 01:13:05,310
those are just like soft suctions,

2729
01:13:05,460 --> 01:13:06,920
Holy Shit,

2730
01:13:07,380 --> 01:13:10,320
don't really have a hook in their mouth.

2731
01:13:10,410 --> 01:13:11,760
And if they lose a leg,

2732
01:13:11,770 --> 01:13:13,140
the leg just grows right back.

2733
01:13:13,170 --> 01:13:14,130
Show gangster.

2734
01:13:14,370 --> 01:13:16,880
And they have eyeballs that are there.

2735
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:18,750
They are really effective,

2736
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:20,940
but there is so different than ours.

2737
01:13:21,090 --> 01:13:25,470
It's like a completely different
branch of the evolutionary chain that,

2738
01:13:25,550 --> 01:13:27,260
I mean got a bitch,

2739
01:13:27,261 --> 01:13:27,530
you know?

2740
01:13:27,530 --> 01:13:28,230
No Shark.

2741
01:13:28,230 --> 01:13:28,411
Yeah.

2742
01:13:28,411 --> 01:13:32,310
What's crazy is when they're born and
from day one they're on their own.

2743
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:34,770
So that's why they're so skittish
and they hide all the time,

2744
01:13:35,010 --> 01:13:39,120
but if you raise octopus in an environment
where they don't have anything to

2745
01:13:39,121 --> 01:13:39,720
fear,

2746
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:40,790
they go right up to you.

2747
01:13:40,820 --> 01:13:43,440
When there's these octopus and these cove,

2748
01:13:43,470 --> 01:13:44,940
I'm watching all these documentaries,

2749
01:13:45,030 --> 01:13:48,090
there's this octopus and it's coded
where they're not afraid at all.

2750
01:13:48,091 --> 01:13:48,541
You Go,

2751
01:13:48,541 --> 01:13:49,351
you go into the water,

2752
01:13:49,351 --> 01:13:51,870
they come right up to you and
look you right in the fucking eye.

2753
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:54,480
They go right up to you and
swim around and check you out.

2754
01:13:54,481 --> 01:13:55,320
They're not scared to shit.

2755
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:57,300
But in the wild since you know,

2756
01:13:57,301 --> 01:13:57,991
since day one,

2757
01:13:57,991 --> 01:13:58,860
they're by themselves.

2758
01:13:58,861 --> 01:13:59,070
They don't.

2759
01:13:59,070 --> 01:13:59,970
Their mothers don't raise them.

2760
01:13:59,971 --> 01:14:02,220
They're just skittish and they're
just hiding and shit all the time.

2761
01:14:02,410 --> 01:14:02,520
Well,

2762
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:04,620
I think when they come in
contact with people to,

2763
01:14:04,621 --> 01:14:06,870
if they have any sort of
means of communication,

2764
01:14:07,110 --> 01:14:10,710
they would let them know
that people are dangerous.

2765
01:14:10,980 --> 01:14:12,310
What they are really smart.

2766
01:14:12,650 --> 01:14:14,860
If I don't know how smart octopus are,

2767
01:14:14,861 --> 01:14:15,694
I mean,

2768
01:14:16,210 --> 01:14:16,451
I know,

2769
01:14:16,451 --> 01:14:17,140
right?

2770
01:14:17,140 --> 01:14:19,690
I don't know how much
information they can transfer.

2771
01:14:20,980 --> 01:14:23,080
There's all these videos of them doing.

2772
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:24,130
They learn really,

2773
01:14:24,131 --> 01:14:24,964
really quick.

2774
01:14:24,970 --> 01:14:25,390
Like what?

2775
01:14:25,390 --> 01:14:26,530
They'll take an octopus,

2776
01:14:26,531 --> 01:14:27,430
a wild octopus,

2777
01:14:27,431 --> 01:14:32,431
they put it in an aquarium and then
they put a crab in some glass container

2778
01:14:32,441 --> 01:14:34,660
where they could see the crab and they
can't figure out how to fucking get the

2779
01:14:34,661 --> 01:14:35,140
crap.

2780
01:14:35,140 --> 01:14:39,820
But then they in the next a container
that an octopus that knows exactly how to

2781
01:14:39,821 --> 01:14:40,300
get them.

2782
01:14:40,300 --> 01:14:42,700
So the fucking octopus is watching.

2783
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:47,760
The other one opened shit up and he's
right there in the octopuses like all

2784
01:14:48,551 --> 01:14:49,384
excited going,

2785
01:14:49,450 --> 01:14:50,283
going like this.

2786
01:14:50,330 --> 01:14:51,163
Oh Shit.

2787
01:14:51,940 --> 01:14:52,810
So then they give them,

2788
01:14:52,900 --> 01:14:53,680
they give,

2789
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:55,540
they give them another fucking crabbing.

2790
01:14:55,541 --> 01:14:56,650
This glass container.

2791
01:14:56,770 --> 01:14:57,550
And that octopus.

2792
01:14:57,550 --> 01:14:58,383
Just

2793
01:14:59,420 --> 01:15:00,253
quick,

2794
01:15:05,320 --> 01:15:05,801
can you look?

2795
01:15:05,801 --> 01:15:07,480
An octopus attacks human.

2796
01:15:07,780 --> 01:15:11,570
They got do this octopus on the picture.

2797
01:15:11,610 --> 01:15:12,630
You with that shirt on?

2798
01:15:12,631 --> 01:15:13,750
A diverse head.

2799
01:15:14,830 --> 01:15:15,663
Octopus.

2800
01:15:16,390 --> 01:15:17,223
Octopus.

2801
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:20,110
Scarier than a blanket shot.

2802
01:15:20,180 --> 01:15:20,620
Get it.

2803
01:15:20,620 --> 01:15:21,190
I get it,

2804
01:15:21,190 --> 01:15:22,023
dude.

2805
01:15:22,690 --> 01:15:26,380
I would rather be in the water
with a shark than a killer.

2806
01:15:27,380 --> 01:15:28,990
A killer occupies.

2807
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:33,880
And how big do you know how big would
the before you start freaking out?

2808
01:15:34,190 --> 01:15:36,580
I mean we're talking about
us like a giant squid,

2809
01:15:36,581 --> 01:15:37,570
like moby Dick Squid.

2810
01:15:37,750 --> 01:15:38,740
You'd have to start getting nervous.

2811
01:15:39,750 --> 01:15:40,150
But Hey,

2812
01:15:40,150 --> 01:15:40,810
but here's the thing,

2813
01:15:40,810 --> 01:15:41,970
200 pound octopus on mount.

2814
01:15:42,010 --> 01:15:42,341
Okay.

2815
01:15:42,341 --> 01:15:42,630
Yeah,

2816
01:15:42,630 --> 01:15:43,463
that's,

2817
01:15:43,690 --> 01:15:44,110
that's enough.

2818
01:15:44,110 --> 01:15:44,943
Fuck that.

2819
01:15:45,310 --> 01:15:46,480
Especially in the water,

2820
01:15:46,481 --> 01:15:47,470
it wouldn't even take that much.

2821
01:15:47,471 --> 01:15:50,730
When you take a 70 pound on that thing

2822
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:54,310
was on his head low.

2823
01:15:54,340 --> 01:15:54,880
If you get.

2824
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:56,380
If you're in the water.

2825
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:56,921
Okay.

2826
01:15:56,921 --> 01:15:57,910
A really big one,

2827
01:15:57,911 --> 01:15:59,980
like a 50 60 pounder could kill you.

2828
01:16:00,610 --> 01:16:03,950
It's real possible drag you.

2829
01:16:03,970 --> 01:16:05,560
And they could bite your tank.

2830
01:16:05,620 --> 01:16:06,453
They could bite your.

2831
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:07,871
They have beaks,

2832
01:16:07,871 --> 01:16:08,650
dude.

2833
01:16:08,650 --> 01:16:10,410
I mean they can tear flint not far.

2834
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:11,793
Not Blast.

2835
01:16:11,830 --> 01:16:12,161
You're right.

2836
01:16:12,161 --> 01:16:12,994
They're not fast.

2837
01:16:13,030 --> 01:16:18,030
But if you got caught up with one
of these in a tangle in the water,

2838
01:16:18,490 --> 01:16:19,510
how are you going to swim?

2839
01:16:19,870 --> 01:16:20,860
How are you going to swim away?

2840
01:16:20,861 --> 01:16:22,120
Like what if it cuts your cable?

2841
01:16:22,121 --> 01:16:24,640
If it's that smart and
it cuts your scuba cable,

2842
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:26,160
you're a dead man for sure.

2843
01:16:26,161 --> 01:16:27,550
Unless you can get to a knife,

2844
01:16:28,310 --> 01:16:31,270
stabbing shit onto getting attacked.

2845
01:16:31,980 --> 01:16:32,441
August.

2846
01:16:32,441 --> 01:16:33,274
Did you guys.

2847
01:16:34,380 --> 01:16:37,270
You guys are discussing what would
happen and they're showing you what's

2848
01:16:37,271 --> 01:16:37,690
happened.

2849
01:16:37,690 --> 01:16:38,523
This

2850
01:16:39,390 --> 01:16:40,223
mask,

2851
01:16:40,330 --> 01:16:41,870
he's taking off his match,

2852
01:16:41,871 --> 01:16:42,890
jumped on his mask.

2853
01:16:44,650 --> 01:16:45,071
Dude,

2854
01:16:45,071 --> 01:16:45,671
I'm telling you.

2855
01:16:45,671 --> 01:16:46,201
Look at this.

2856
01:16:46,201 --> 01:16:46,610
This guy.

2857
01:16:46,610 --> 01:16:49,600
The Camera Guy's not helping Jack Legos.

2858
01:16:49,860 --> 01:16:50,710
Yank it off.

2859
01:16:51,010 --> 01:16:51,281
Yeah,

2860
01:16:51,281 --> 01:16:52,240
but he's got to be careful,

2861
01:16:52,241 --> 01:16:52,870
right?

2862
01:16:52,870 --> 01:16:53,650
Oh my God.

2863
01:16:53,650 --> 01:16:54,483
That's a big EXEC.

2864
01:16:54,490 --> 01:16:55,323
I'm not talking about.

2865
01:16:55,390 --> 01:16:56,240
Once you

2866
01:16:59,710 --> 01:17:04,710
do this isn't a problem in Washington
off the coast at octopus that attack.

2867
01:17:05,170 --> 01:17:06,660
How many people die a year from mocket?

2868
01:17:06,670 --> 01:17:06,850
This?

2869
01:17:06,850 --> 01:17:07,390
Look at the.

2870
01:17:07,390 --> 01:17:07,920
See.

2871
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:08,880
See The fucking beak.

2872
01:17:08,990 --> 01:17:09,823
I'm not worried about

2873
01:17:10,090 --> 01:17:10,611
the movie,

2874
01:17:10,611 --> 01:17:10,970
right?

2875
01:17:10,970 --> 01:17:15,260
Like some bunch of 20 year olds go
camping off the coast of Washington.

2876
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:15,561
Jamie.

2877
01:17:15,561 --> 01:17:18,230
Rewind that because it's
like a thing from the alien,

2878
01:17:18,231 --> 01:17:19,220
from the movie alien.

2879
01:17:19,370 --> 01:17:20,150
Look at the tongue.

2880
01:17:20,150 --> 01:17:20,691
Comes out,

2881
01:17:20,691 --> 01:17:21,170
look at this.

2882
01:17:21,170 --> 01:17:21,561
Meanwhile,

2883
01:17:21,561 --> 01:17:24,100
homeboys on screen crying
his eyes out to do.

2884
01:17:24,210 --> 01:17:25,043
They might be,

2885
01:17:25,580 --> 01:17:28,790
they might be aliens or they
might live in the ocean.

2886
01:17:30,250 --> 01:17:31,090
I'm going to go with Joe

2887
01:17:33,070 --> 01:17:35,970
here they are

2888
01:17:38,190 --> 01:17:39,380
animals from another planet.

2889
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:39,590
Yeah.

2890
01:17:39,590 --> 01:17:40,640
This guy's getting jacked.

2891
01:17:40,641 --> 01:17:42,500
I think it was just trying to test them,

2892
01:17:42,770 --> 01:17:43,221
but you know,

2893
01:17:43,221 --> 01:17:43,940
they're um,

2894
01:17:43,940 --> 01:17:47,690
they found these fossil remains of
what they think was an enormous one.

2895
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:49,340
The problem with one of these things die.

2896
01:17:49,341 --> 01:17:51,080
We don't know how big they used to be.

2897
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:51,381
You know,

2898
01:17:51,381 --> 01:17:52,760
we know like megalodon existed,

2899
01:17:52,761 --> 01:17:54,710
but we know that basically
because of his jaw,

2900
01:17:54,890 --> 01:17:56,870
because we don't know what,

2901
01:17:56,871 --> 01:18:01,070
how big their like their beaks were and
like there's times they can't find their

2902
01:18:01,071 --> 01:18:02,540
bodies because their body's deteriorate,

2903
01:18:02,570 --> 01:18:07,570
but they have fossilized remains of
enormous suction cups in like an octopus

2904
01:18:08,540 --> 01:18:11,630
tentacle formation that
they think indicates that,

2905
01:18:11,631 --> 01:18:12,070
let the,

2906
01:18:12,070 --> 01:18:15,380
those mysteries of the cracking where
they would talk about this enormous

2907
01:18:15,381 --> 01:18:19,190
fucking octopus that could take down the
ship and the sailors would see them at

2908
01:18:19,191 --> 01:18:21,080
CNB terrifies some scary shit,

2909
01:18:21,110 --> 01:18:22,040
could've been bullshit,

2910
01:18:22,041 --> 01:18:26,450
but they have these fossilized versions
now of those tentacles of suction cups

2911
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:30,260
that are making scientists reconsider
and they think there might have been an

2912
01:18:30,261 --> 01:18:31,094
enormous one.

2913
01:18:31,130 --> 01:18:33,740
Like they never even saw that giant
squid until like a few years ago.

2914
01:18:33,770 --> 01:18:35,270
I'm just saying the octopus now,

2915
01:18:35,330 --> 01:18:40,040
not scared to dudes are going to
train octopus to jerk him off launch.

2916
01:18:40,041 --> 01:18:40,874
That's the future.

2917
01:18:41,780 --> 01:18:42,613
No Man.

2918
01:18:44,170 --> 01:18:45,510
Little pokers in those,

2919
01:18:45,540 --> 01:18:45,970
those two.

2920
01:18:45,970 --> 01:18:46,980
You gotta you gotTa clip up.

2921
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,800
Clip the pokers bonkers.

2922
01:18:49,620 --> 01:18:49,830
Like,

2923
01:18:49,830 --> 01:18:50,180
you know,

2924
01:18:50,180 --> 01:18:52,790
you give your cat what do you
do when you put it in here?

2925
01:18:52,791 --> 01:18:54,050
But um,

2926
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:54,913
you

2927
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:56,510
know,

2928
01:18:56,510 --> 01:18:57,720
you pull his teeth out,

2929
01:18:58,970 --> 01:19:00,550
you guys have the wrong Richard Gere,

2930
01:19:03,260 --> 01:19:04,093
you break,

2931
01:19:04,510 --> 01:19:05,970
you know,

2932
01:19:06,010 --> 01:19:07,040
you shake them down.

2933
01:19:07,041 --> 01:19:07,191
No,

2934
01:19:07,191 --> 01:19:08,170
you just pull the teeth.

2935
01:19:08,340 --> 01:19:10,220
I'll put them in a giant condom,

2936
01:19:10,250 --> 01:19:12,290
like a bicycle to

2937
01:19:14,530 --> 01:19:16,030
go rob dawg on Ligo.

2938
01:19:16,100 --> 01:19:16,933
Raw.

2939
01:19:17,110 --> 01:19:17,780
Terrible.

2940
01:19:17,780 --> 01:19:18,920
But if you want to do it safe

2941
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:22,650
to say you've got to break down,

2942
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:25,550
I would never do it without breaking.

2943
01:19:25,551 --> 01:19:26,970
Their job is put it inside you.

2944
01:19:27,470 --> 01:19:28,160
Hammer fist.

2945
01:19:28,160 --> 01:19:29,450
You just hold her head down and go.

2946
01:19:29,570 --> 01:19:30,560
Which just wonderful.

2947
01:19:31,750 --> 01:19:36,750
I'm Josh Barnett Versus Roy
Nelson is the main event here.

2948
01:19:37,591 --> 01:19:40,480
And this is interesting watching Josh
Barnett back in the [inaudible] pride his

2949
01:19:40,550 --> 01:19:41,580
font while.

2950
01:19:41,910 --> 01:19:42,260
No,

2951
01:19:42,260 --> 01:19:43,093
he hasn't.

2952
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:44,540
He hasn't fought since Travis Browne,

2953
01:19:44,541 --> 01:19:44,871
correct?

2954
01:19:44,871 --> 01:19:45,704
Correct.

2955
01:19:45,710 --> 01:19:46,790
But he's been doing metamorris,

2956
01:19:46,791 --> 01:19:47,790
but that's a different animal.

2957
01:19:47,830 --> 01:19:50,450
Ellen at grappling
submitted here on Gracie.

2958
01:19:50,451 --> 01:19:51,380
That is not easy.

2959
01:19:52,910 --> 01:19:53,121
Yeah,

2960
01:19:53,121 --> 01:19:53,661
he's a beast.

2961
01:19:53,661 --> 01:19:54,260
Dude.

2962
01:19:54,260 --> 01:19:58,680
Submitted Dean lister to
WHO's even picking Dean least
are there you go at least

2963
01:19:58,990 --> 01:20:01,010
least least least or bowling.

2964
01:20:01,370 --> 01:20:06,350
He was one of the first guys to submit
dean in like fucking 15 or 16 years

2965
01:20:06,580 --> 01:20:07,413
forever.

2966
01:20:07,480 --> 01:20:08,120
Eddie

2967
01:20:08,120 --> 01:20:10,810
in competition I think.

2968
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:12,400
I remember right.

2969
01:20:14,270 --> 01:20:14,521
I mean,

2970
01:20:14,521 --> 01:20:16,350
maybe it was like as a black belt ever,

2971
01:20:16,351 --> 01:20:17,370
but whatever it was,

2972
01:20:17,371 --> 01:20:18,360
it was super and prettier.

2973
01:20:18,390 --> 01:20:22,530
We betting on this main event and Co
main event what we're betting on the main

2974
01:20:22,531 --> 01:20:23,420
event not to kill me.

2975
01:20:23,450 --> 01:20:25,210
I got Barnett Barnett.

2976
01:20:25,211 --> 01:20:25,320
See,

2977
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:25,621
I think,

2978
01:20:25,621 --> 01:20:26,401
but it's going to win,

2979
01:20:26,401 --> 01:20:28,560
but I'll bet you for the sake of it guys,

2980
01:20:28,561 --> 01:20:30,370
don't take it off.

2981
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:32,510
I think he came his way out of the thing.

2982
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:34,560
Josh is too expensive to eat that one.

2983
01:20:34,561 --> 01:20:36,000
I think guys have figured out Roy.

2984
01:20:36,150 --> 01:20:36,601
Right?

2985
01:20:36,601 --> 01:20:37,840
And it shows because he's won one.

2986
01:20:37,860 --> 01:20:39,120
I was last four fights.

2987
01:20:39,510 --> 01:20:40,560
He's one in four.

2988
01:20:40,561 --> 01:20:41,640
Have left five I think.

2989
01:20:41,850 --> 01:20:42,091
Yeah.

2990
01:20:42,091 --> 01:20:42,841
I don't know man.

2991
01:20:42,841 --> 01:20:44,580
I think a great deal has been fighting.

2992
01:20:44,581 --> 01:20:44,911
Tough.

2993
01:20:44,911 --> 01:20:45,560
Tough guys.

2994
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:45,740
Oh,

2995
01:20:45,740 --> 01:20:47,970
I can always turn the
lights out on you man.

2996
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:50,130
But when you're finding
out that like Josh Barnett,

2997
01:20:50,250 --> 01:20:50,600
man,

2998
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:52,590
they got a huge right hand.

2999
01:20:52,740 --> 01:20:53,400
Cool.

3000
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:53,820
We're going to.

3001
01:20:53,820 --> 01:20:54,780
We're going to minimize that.

3002
01:20:54,781 --> 01:20:56,040
I'm going to get you into the cage.

3003
01:20:56,520 --> 01:20:57,151
And really,

3004
01:20:57,151 --> 01:20:57,391
you know,

3005
01:20:57,391 --> 01:20:58,920
we talk about Roy being a black belt,

3006
01:20:58,921 --> 01:20:59,521
which he is.

3007
01:20:59,521 --> 01:21:00,900
Don't even run under Henzel Gracie.

3008
01:21:01,290 --> 01:21:02,250
But Josh Barnett,

3009
01:21:02,251 --> 01:21:04,080
some motherfucker,

3010
01:21:04,110 --> 01:21:05,070
he's gonna get you down,

3011
01:21:05,170 --> 01:21:06,300
he's going to get you down.

3012
01:21:06,330 --> 01:21:07,330
You certainly a motherfucker.

3013
01:21:07,350 --> 01:21:08,700
And if you remember Frank Mir,

3014
01:21:08,701 --> 01:21:09,151
verse Roy,

3015
01:21:09,151 --> 01:21:09,451
Nelson,

3016
01:21:09,451 --> 01:21:09,821
matter of frank,

3017
01:21:09,821 --> 01:21:10,410
I'm against the cage,

3018
01:21:10,410 --> 01:21:12,780
was taken down kind of whooping
his ass when I see that.

3019
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:15,730
I think Barnett's looking at that footage
going right when you going young this

3020
01:21:15,780 --> 01:21:16,220
cage,

3021
01:21:16,220 --> 01:21:18,630
when I get them down and do work.

3022
01:21:18,670 --> 01:21:18,800
Yeah.

3023
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:20,100
I don't know about that fight.

3024
01:21:20,220 --> 01:21:21,000
Um,

3025
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:21,990
the um,

3026
01:21:22,020 --> 01:21:23,820
because how impressive was Josh?

3027
01:21:23,821 --> 01:21:24,690
He gets Frank Mir.

3028
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:25,980
Super impressive.

3029
01:21:26,370 --> 01:21:26,880
I mean,

3030
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:27,420
he,

3031
01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:30,870
he made Frank Mir looked like it
was towards the end of his career.

3032
01:21:30,871 --> 01:21:34,110
And then Frank Mir after that
one on this big combat time off.

3033
01:21:34,140 --> 01:21:34,740
Yeah.

3034
01:21:34,740 --> 01:21:36,510
But when you look at that fight,

3035
01:21:36,570 --> 01:21:36,800
that's,

3036
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:37,680
that's a big part of it,

3037
01:21:37,681 --> 01:21:38,010
right?

3038
01:21:38,010 --> 01:21:39,330
The time off is a big part of it.

3039
01:21:39,331 --> 01:21:40,830
That's a really important point actually.

3040
01:21:41,850 --> 01:21:44,040
I think Josh Barnett is super crafty man.

3041
01:21:44,041 --> 01:21:45,060
He knows so much.

3042
01:21:45,090 --> 01:21:46,180
He's such a veteran.

3043
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:47,460
He's such a veteran.

3044
01:21:47,580 --> 01:21:48,420
When we look him in the UFC,

3045
01:21:48,421 --> 01:21:49,460
especially this comeback.

3046
01:21:49,530 --> 01:21:50,311
He's one and one,

3047
01:21:50,311 --> 01:21:50,760
right?

3048
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:51,593
He beat mayor,

3049
01:21:51,780 --> 01:21:53,970
which at the time it
wasn't like the mayor now,

3050
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:57,630
but he smashed it smashed and he
did it in a pretty ruthless way.

3051
01:21:57,660 --> 01:21:58,490
Charged with that.

3052
01:21:58,490 --> 01:21:59,640
Sent him with that knee.

3053
01:21:59,730 --> 01:22:00,480
Yeah.

3054
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:01,021
Well he also.

3055
01:22:01,021 --> 01:22:01,854
Then he got hurt.

3056
01:22:01,860 --> 01:22:04,920
Then he got murked by Travis Brown
did and they took a bunch of time off.

3057
01:22:04,950 --> 01:22:06,410
He got Travis Browne that,

3058
01:22:06,470 --> 01:22:11,470
that one technique that travis use on
Gonzaga and he used on elbow to elbow with

3059
01:22:11,900 --> 01:22:13,500
with that widespread that he has.

3060
01:22:13,501 --> 01:22:13,920
When is,

3061
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:14,820
that's all we trained.

3062
01:22:15,150 --> 01:22:16,130
That's all we trained with,

3063
01:22:16,150 --> 01:22:19,050
but it's fucking takedown
defense is so nasty.

3064
01:22:19,051 --> 01:22:20,940
So why so fucking tall?

3065
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:22,920
That elbow comes fast too.

3066
01:22:22,970 --> 01:22:23,190
I,

3067
01:22:23,190 --> 01:22:24,023
I just think.

3068
01:22:24,620 --> 01:22:26,160
I think Barnett with Roy,

3069
01:22:26,190 --> 01:22:27,023
I think.

3070
01:22:27,030 --> 01:22:28,380
I think Steve Bay was the first one.

3071
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:32,480
Let's just avoid this right hand and go
to work and Josh is such smarter fighter

3072
01:22:32,490 --> 01:22:33,450
than all these other guys.

3073
01:22:33,930 --> 01:22:34,201
Well,

3074
01:22:34,201 --> 01:22:35,310
I think it's super interesting,

3075
01:22:35,311 --> 01:22:38,370
but we're also assuming that Roy hasn't
figured out that it needs to make some

3076
01:22:38,371 --> 01:22:39,660
adjustments to too late.

3077
01:22:39,661 --> 01:22:39,960
Brother.

3078
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:40,793
I don't know about that.

3079
01:22:40,950 --> 01:22:41,540
Really.

3080
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:42,390
I don't know about that.

3081
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:43,290
I disagree.

3082
01:22:43,290 --> 01:22:44,960
See what I know about Roy's,

3083
01:22:44,970 --> 01:22:46,110
he got good at Jujitsu,

3084
01:22:46,111 --> 01:22:49,350
enough to be a black belt and not enough
to be a highly considered black belt,

3085
01:22:49,380 --> 01:22:51,970
beat Frank Mir and they're
grappling competition like to.

3086
01:22:51,971 --> 01:22:53,490
To get that good at grappling,

3087
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:54,930
you have to be able to solve problems.

3088
01:22:55,140 --> 01:22:58,500
So if he is really good at this
one thing that he already knows,

3089
01:22:58,560 --> 01:22:59,700
he's really good at knocking people.

3090
01:22:59,701 --> 01:23:01,950
Talking about a young guy
when he competed and all that.

3091
01:23:01,980 --> 01:23:02,100
Yeah,

3092
01:23:02,100 --> 01:23:03,960
but don't you think that
he's just as hungry now?

3093
01:23:03,961 --> 01:23:04,341
It's probably.

3094
01:23:04,341 --> 01:23:06,010
It's ever been before and I never see that

3095
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:06,390
guy.

3096
01:23:06,390 --> 01:23:06,910
I disagree.

3097
01:23:06,910 --> 01:23:09,700
Looking like he's lost
his enthusiasm for things.

3098
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,070
He's always been trying to fight
the best guys in the world.

3099
01:23:12,430 --> 01:23:12,821
I mean,

3100
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:16,420
and he's had some spectacular results
against high level guys like who the check

3101
01:23:16,421 --> 01:23:18,280
Congo fight when he knocked
out check Congo check.

3102
01:23:18,281 --> 01:23:19,990
Congo is pretty highly regarded right?

3103
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:20,441
Mitch,

3104
01:23:20,441 --> 01:23:23,020
when he has been highly regarded.

3105
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:23,501
Yeah,

3106
01:23:23,501 --> 01:23:24,970
after the Cain Velasquez fight,

3107
01:23:25,510 --> 01:23:26,110
especially.

3108
01:23:26,110 --> 01:23:26,681
God Damn.

3109
01:23:26,681 --> 01:23:27,514
That was a while ago.

3110
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:29,060
It was and he still loves it.

3111
01:23:29,061 --> 01:23:30,460
He knocked out a pat barry,

3112
01:23:30,970 --> 01:23:31,760
Pat Barry Fletcher.

3113
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:32,450
You can come back.

3114
01:23:32,450 --> 01:23:34,490
It's a long time to stop.

3115
01:23:34,640 --> 01:23:35,473
I

3116
01:23:36,680 --> 01:23:37,513
stopped taking that

3117
01:23:38,870 --> 01:23:39,460
medicine man,

3118
01:23:39,460 --> 01:23:41,230
Pat Barry Street.

3119
01:23:41,231 --> 01:23:44,160
He gave him his mailbox
keys to his apartment.

3120
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:44,460
Pat,

3121
01:23:44,460 --> 01:23:44,740
you know,

3122
01:23:44,740 --> 01:23:45,241
I love you,

3123
01:23:45,241 --> 01:23:45,630
you know,

3124
01:23:45,630 --> 01:23:46,001
I love you,

3125
01:23:46,001 --> 01:23:47,920
but Pat Barry's not a world class guy,

3126
01:23:47,980 --> 01:23:51,900
but at that time Pat Barry had never
been knocked out before in Congo.

3127
01:23:51,910 --> 01:23:53,140
Knocked him out with one punch.

3128
01:23:53,560 --> 01:23:54,340
That's fact.

3129
01:23:54,340 --> 01:23:55,480
That is a fact check.

3130
01:23:55,820 --> 01:23:58,840
But Pat had not been knocked out
before and that sort of started like,

3131
01:23:58,930 --> 01:23:59,200
uh,

3132
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:02,380
a series of bad losses that
pat had fought tougher guys.

3133
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:04,120
Pat as a wild dude,

3134
01:24:04,760 --> 01:24:07,210
he came hard and strong and had him hurt.

3135
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:07,900
Sure.

3136
01:24:07,900 --> 01:24:08,860
Was an amazing fat.

3137
01:24:08,890 --> 01:24:10,180
One of the best of all in Congo.

3138
01:24:10,181 --> 01:24:11,050
Came back and knocked him out.

3139
01:24:11,051 --> 01:24:11,481
So I got,

3140
01:24:11,481 --> 01:24:14,700
I think Congo is pretty highly
regarded my opinion in an MC.

3141
01:24:14,830 --> 01:24:16,360
And then after that Roy knocking them out.

3142
01:24:16,420 --> 01:24:17,230
I thought it was pretty.

3143
01:24:17,230 --> 01:24:18,760
I'm pretty sure that's
the way it happened.

3144
01:24:19,210 --> 01:24:22,900
I'm pretty sure roy knocked him
out after he had the war with pep.

3145
01:24:22,910 --> 01:24:23,743
That's correct.

3146
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:24,633
That's correct.

3147
01:24:25,990 --> 01:24:26,830
I just think that,

3148
01:24:26,831 --> 01:24:27,430
uh,

3149
01:24:27,430 --> 01:24:31,450
Roy has some stupid power and you
never know with a guy like that man,

3150
01:24:31,451 --> 01:24:33,130
what a guy has that kind of stupid power.

3151
01:24:33,670 --> 01:24:34,660
If Roy hits you,

3152
01:24:34,661 --> 01:24:35,560
if you fuck up,

3153
01:24:35,630 --> 01:24:39,250
if zig zags over the dude can shut it off.

3154
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:42,670
But when you get to a certain
level and you only have one thing,

3155
01:24:42,671 --> 01:24:43,930
I'm not saying royal has one thing,

3156
01:24:43,931 --> 01:24:47,170
but if your right hand the motherfucker
and you get to a certain level,

3157
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:48,850
these pros pros go,

3158
01:24:48,940 --> 01:24:49,450
okay,

3159
01:24:49,450 --> 01:24:50,410
not getting caught with that.

3160
01:24:50,590 --> 01:24:53,160
And it showed him because
he's one wanting one is fine.

3161
01:24:53,260 --> 01:24:53,681
I think,

3162
01:24:53,681 --> 01:24:53,951
you know,

3163
01:24:53,951 --> 01:24:56,650
it's cute too that he has that look,

3164
01:24:56,770 --> 01:24:56,981
you know,

3165
01:24:56,981 --> 01:24:58,390
with the big bell and he rubs his belt.

3166
01:24:58,391 --> 01:24:59,530
He gets on top of the octagon.

3167
01:24:59,531 --> 01:25:02,710
But I think the reality is he would move
better and fight better if he didn't

3168
01:25:02,711 --> 01:25:03,560
have the hundred percent.

3169
01:25:03,561 --> 01:25:06,760
It's amazing how far he's gotten
with all that extra body fat.

3170
01:25:06,930 --> 01:25:07,500
It's amazing.

3171
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:09,370
He's world class 1:55.

3172
01:25:10,450 --> 01:25:11,320
That's a stretch.

3173
01:25:11,690 --> 01:25:12,523
That's a good.

3174
01:25:13,090 --> 01:25:13,631
First of all,

3175
01:25:13,631 --> 01:25:14,350
how dare you.

3176
01:25:14,350 --> 01:25:18,280
How dare you cover of the Ugi right now.

3177
01:25:18,340 --> 01:25:18,671
Come on,

3178
01:25:18,671 --> 01:25:19,001
fuck it.

3179
01:25:19,001 --> 01:25:19,601
Front page,

3180
01:25:19,601 --> 01:25:21,460
Eddie Bravo says Roy Nelson could make

3181
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:24,370
he got his diet together.

3182
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:25,313
No

3183
01:25:26,620 --> 01:25:28,120
fibers are legit to a fight.

3184
01:25:28,121 --> 01:25:29,350
He's a thick dude man.

3185
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:30,400
But I mean look,

3186
01:25:30,401 --> 01:25:34,330
maybe working skinny the fuck
out of himself and make one 85.

3187
01:25:34,540 --> 01:25:36,520
But if he did he'd
probably be in hell two.

3188
01:25:36,521 --> 01:25:36,641
Oh,

3189
01:25:36,641 --> 01:25:37,030
five.

3190
01:25:37,030 --> 01:25:37,181
Two.

3191
01:25:37,181 --> 01:25:37,301
Oh,

3192
01:25:37,301 --> 01:25:38,260
five reasonable.

3193
01:25:38,470 --> 01:25:38,831
Okay.

3194
01:25:38,831 --> 01:25:40,050
But if you waste,

3195
01:25:40,210 --> 01:25:41,290
what is he way to 50?

3196
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:42,153
What do you think he weighs?

3197
01:25:42,700 --> 01:25:42,911
Yeah.

3198
01:25:42,911 --> 01:25:43,361
Two 50.

3199
01:25:43,361 --> 01:25:44,170
Five to 50.

3200
01:25:44,170 --> 01:25:46,150
How many pounds overweight
do you think is.

3201
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:47,860
If you look at that big giant belly?

3202
01:25:49,770 --> 01:25:50,390
No,

3203
01:25:50,390 --> 01:25:51,120
I don't know.

3204
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:52,420
How much is that overweight?

3205
01:25:52,421 --> 01:25:53,350
I mean like what

3206
01:25:55,180 --> 01:25:58,750
used to be 300 pounds and he thought at
300 pounds and then he got down to one

3207
01:25:58,751 --> 01:25:59,200
70.

3208
01:25:59,200 --> 01:25:59,531
Yeah.

3209
01:25:59,531 --> 01:25:59,980
But Joe,

3210
01:25:59,980 --> 01:26:01,660
Joe Riggs was a different thing.

3211
01:26:01,690 --> 01:26:03,220
I mean not that tall.

3212
01:26:03,290 --> 01:26:04,070
I think when we first started

3213
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:04,491
losing weight,

3214
01:26:04,491 --> 01:26:06,080
Joe was like really obese.

3215
01:26:06,170 --> 01:26:08,390
I think it was a different
kind of like lego obese arm.

3216
01:26:08,391 --> 01:26:08,960
Obese.

3217
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:12,550
Like Roy successful at that successful.

3218
01:26:12,620 --> 01:26:13,070
Well you sold.

3219
01:26:13,070 --> 01:26:14,750
It's weird because he's
only got it in the belly,

3220
01:26:14,930 --> 01:26:16,220
like his arms aren't fat.

3221
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:17,540
His arms are like it,

3222
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:19,340
like a stocky guy on

3223
01:26:21,470 --> 01:26:22,510
his bellies.

3224
01:26:22,580 --> 01:26:26,870
This giant belly and muscular like you
don't have like the definition of his

3225
01:26:26,871 --> 01:26:27,590
shoulders.

3226
01:26:27,590 --> 01:26:28,910
Look at Mark High Mark.

3227
01:26:30,910 --> 01:26:33,320
Mark Hunt carries his body
fat like all over the place.

3228
01:26:33,380 --> 01:26:34,710
He's got his body fat and his arms

3229
01:26:36,470 --> 01:26:37,303
and his legs,

3230
01:26:37,530 --> 01:26:39,440
but Roy has it mostly in his belly.

3231
01:26:39,730 --> 01:26:39,951
He's like,

3232
01:26:39,951 --> 01:26:41,030
he has it all on his belly.

3233
01:26:42,140 --> 01:26:45,100
I'm not a nutritional expert
so I could throw some bro.

3234
01:26:45,110 --> 01:26:46,790
Science takes a bro.

3235
01:26:46,791 --> 01:26:48,230
Science like a motherfucking.

3236
01:26:48,530 --> 01:26:50,630
Someone called dolce immediately.

3237
01:26:50,990 --> 01:26:52,010
We need to find out.

3238
01:26:52,011 --> 01:26:52,490
I don't know what.

3239
01:26:52,490 --> 01:26:56,500
What makes a guy's gut stick out more
like when you see a guy and he has that

3240
01:26:56,510 --> 01:26:57,440
giant belly,

3241
01:26:57,441 --> 01:26:59,150
but everything else seemed
sort of normal size.

3242
01:26:59,150 --> 01:26:59,720
Like what is.

3243
01:26:59,720 --> 01:27:01,010
Is that a diet thing?

3244
01:27:01,160 --> 01:27:04,640
Is that a generic is just as
genetics goes to the Sony guys?

3245
01:27:04,641 --> 01:27:07,100
A giant bellies but the
legs are kind of normal.

3246
01:27:07,530 --> 01:27:08,540
It's like a girl though.

3247
01:27:08,610 --> 01:27:11,270
Sometimes girls eat and they
just have these fat ass is bro.

3248
01:27:11,271 --> 01:27:11,990
So,

3249
01:27:11,990 --> 01:27:13,760
and then the arms in the stomach,

3250
01:27:14,150 --> 01:27:18,030
I used to work with this guy and he
was a construction guy and it was,

3251
01:27:18,090 --> 01:27:18,980
it was the weirdest,

3252
01:27:19,100 --> 01:27:20,270
the weirdest body of all time.

3253
01:27:20,690 --> 01:27:21,110
His,

3254
01:27:21,110 --> 01:27:22,550
his legs were normal sized,

3255
01:27:22,730 --> 01:27:23,900
his arms are normal size,

3256
01:27:24,110 --> 01:27:29,110
his face was barely fat and then his
chest was fairly normal and then he had

3257
01:27:30,321 --> 01:27:33,620
this crazy fucking belly that
didn't make any sense to.

3258
01:27:33,660 --> 01:27:35,210
You would just look at his belly and go,

3259
01:27:35,211 --> 01:27:36,500
what in the fuck?

3260
01:27:36,530 --> 01:27:37,940
But then I thought about it one day.

3261
01:27:37,941 --> 01:27:38,241
I was like,

3262
01:27:38,241 --> 01:27:38,451
oh,

3263
01:27:38,451 --> 01:27:41,360
that guy would have to do is get
rid of that part of his body.

3264
01:27:41,590 --> 01:27:45,950
And he's like a guy placed on a
regular basis hitting the gym,

3265
01:27:45,980 --> 01:27:46,920
taking a spin class.

3266
01:27:46,921 --> 01:27:48,470
He looks like a normal guy.

3267
01:27:48,471 --> 01:27:49,251
It's a big if though,

3268
01:27:49,251 --> 01:27:50,084
sometimes it's a,

3269
01:27:50,510 --> 01:27:53,690
sometimes it's a kind of a hormone issue,

3270
01:27:53,691 --> 01:27:54,050
right?

3271
01:27:54,050 --> 01:27:57,650
Like it's hormone glands straight bro.

3272
01:27:57,660 --> 01:28:02,340
So science Nelson's a motherfucker bro.

3273
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:02,920
Science.

3274
01:28:02,920 --> 01:28:03,890
It's just a bunch of dudes.

3275
01:28:04,750 --> 01:28:05,740
Straight bullshit

3276
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:08,570
documentary bro.

3277
01:28:08,630 --> 01:28:09,411
Oh Shit.

3278
01:28:09,411 --> 01:28:10,590
It's a hormone thing.

3279
01:28:11,940 --> 01:28:12,290
Times.

3280
01:28:12,290 --> 01:28:14,330
It's good to not have google nearby.

3281
01:28:14,360 --> 01:28:14,740
True.

3282
01:28:14,740 --> 01:28:14,980
You know,

3283
01:28:14,980 --> 01:28:16,100
just to like have fun,

3284
01:28:16,250 --> 01:28:17,920
spend way funner.

3285
01:28:18,020 --> 01:28:19,550
Brings us back to the old days,

3286
01:28:19,670 --> 01:28:24,260
as long as no one likes to pretend
they don't like to pretend that a,

3287
01:28:24,261 --> 01:28:25,530
they know what the fuck
they're talking about,

3288
01:28:25,550 --> 01:28:25,761
bro.

3289
01:28:25,761 --> 01:28:27,080
Science goes down the chain,

3290
01:28:27,081 --> 01:28:27,290
you know,

3291
01:28:27,290 --> 01:28:29,390
because whatever you tell
me that I tell someone.

3292
01:28:29,630 --> 01:28:30,321
Exactly.

3293
01:28:30,321 --> 01:28:31,154
Yeah.

3294
01:28:31,320 --> 01:28:34,260
Times I've said that so
many times I heard that.

3295
01:28:34,580 --> 01:28:35,413
You know what?

3296
01:28:36,370 --> 01:28:37,203
I always do that.

3297
01:28:37,340 --> 01:28:40,640
I'm pretty sure it's a weird thing though,

3298
01:28:40,641 --> 01:28:40,911
man,

3299
01:28:40,911 --> 01:28:42,680
like people's People's diets.

3300
01:28:43,020 --> 01:28:43,250
You know,

3301
01:28:43,250 --> 01:28:47,180
I've been paying attention to my sugar
intake lately over the last few weeks,

3302
01:28:48,530 --> 01:28:49,230
but I just,

3303
01:28:49,230 --> 01:28:51,560
I'm shocked at how much sugar
is in things that I didn't know.

3304
01:28:51,561 --> 01:28:55,430
Do you know that low fat milk for the
most part has sugar and eight grams son,

3305
01:28:55,490 --> 01:28:59,480
they put sugar and low fat milk because
otherwise it's just nothing sugar,

3306
01:28:59,510 --> 01:29:02,280
low fat sugar or low fat
milk rather don't drink it.

3307
01:29:02,310 --> 01:29:03,660
It has no nutritional value.

3308
01:29:03,720 --> 01:29:06,330
None because all the
things like vitamin D,

3309
01:29:06,420 --> 01:29:07,200
vitaminK ,

3310
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:08,033
vitamin E,

3311
01:29:08,070 --> 01:29:09,960
they all have to bond a fats.

3312
01:29:10,290 --> 01:29:10,900
So like the,

3313
01:29:10,900 --> 01:29:11,140
the,

3314
01:29:11,140 --> 01:29:11,350
the,

3315
01:29:11,350 --> 01:29:12,630
there's no fats in the milk,

3316
01:29:12,631 --> 01:29:14,190
so it's like you're just drinking water.

3317
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:15,473
Like nonsense.

3318
01:29:15,700 --> 01:29:16,440
I like milk.

3319
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:17,340
I like almond milk,

3320
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:19,200
almond milk and rice milk,

3321
01:29:19,350 --> 01:29:19,891
almond milk.

3322
01:29:19,891 --> 01:29:20,251
Again,

3323
01:29:20,251 --> 01:29:21,031
same thing though,

3324
01:29:21,031 --> 01:29:22,110
if you read the ingredients,

3325
01:29:22,111 --> 01:29:23,950
that shit is all sugar son.

3326
01:29:23,970 --> 01:29:25,080
You can get zero sugar.

3327
01:29:25,380 --> 01:29:26,340
Unsweet sweetened,

3328
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:26,851
unsweetened.

3329
01:29:26,851 --> 01:29:27,770
It's delicious.

3330
01:29:27,900 --> 01:29:29,190
Zero grams of sugar.

3331
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:31,160
The most of the stuff
you get though has the.

3332
01:29:31,161 --> 01:29:31,630
Like the.

3333
01:29:31,630 --> 01:29:34,080
The treatments have unsweet no.

3334
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:36,210
Duncan trussell called
me up and he's like,

3335
01:29:36,211 --> 01:29:36,810
dude,

3336
01:29:36,810 --> 01:29:37,230
fucking.

3337
01:29:37,230 --> 01:29:40,290
I've found the best almond
milk and so amazing taste.

3338
01:29:40,291 --> 01:29:41,124
So good.

3339
01:29:41,130 --> 01:29:41,941
It's good for you.

3340
01:29:41,941 --> 01:29:43,520
I don't know why.

3341
01:29:43,590 --> 01:29:44,341
How's it tastes good?

3342
01:29:44,341 --> 01:29:44,521
He goes,

3343
01:29:44,521 --> 01:29:45,301
it's delicious.

3344
01:29:45,301 --> 01:29:45,540
I go,

3345
01:29:45,540 --> 01:29:46,200
Ooh,

3346
01:29:46,200 --> 01:29:47,640
did you check to see
how much sugar's in it?

3347
01:29:47,930 --> 01:29:50,820
And so we did it on the phone and it
was just some stupid amount and it was

3348
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:52,680
probably like a little baby glass.

3349
01:29:52,740 --> 01:29:53,970
They know you're not going to have,

3350
01:29:54,160 --> 01:29:55,890
you know you're not going
to have a big glass.

3351
01:29:56,040 --> 01:29:57,030
I know some tastes good.

3352
01:29:57,031 --> 01:29:57,540
Has Sugar.

3353
01:29:57,540 --> 01:29:58,500
That's my biggest problem.

3354
01:29:58,770 --> 01:30:01,390
That's my sugar by worst sweet tooth man.

3355
01:30:01,740 --> 01:30:02,610
Sometimes I wonder why.

3356
01:30:02,611 --> 01:30:04,410
Work out so hard so I can eat like shit.

3357
01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:07,230
Do you want some mangoes
with Chili on them right now?

3358
01:30:07,330 --> 01:30:08,400
I'm never mad at that.

3359
01:30:08,520 --> 01:30:09,080
Jamie.

3360
01:30:09,080 --> 01:30:11,080
Where are those fresh mangoes?

3361
01:30:11,160 --> 01:30:11,331
No,

3362
01:30:11,331 --> 01:30:11,430
no,

3363
01:30:11,430 --> 01:30:11,740
no.

3364
01:30:11,740 --> 01:30:12,810
Like dried mangoes.

3365
01:30:13,080 --> 01:30:14,370
This is my problem lately.

3366
01:30:14,371 --> 01:30:14,671
I have.

3367
01:30:14,671 --> 01:30:15,504
I have an issue.

3368
01:30:15,510 --> 01:30:16,770
Mango sticky rice baby.

3369
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:17,341
I have an issue.

3370
01:30:17,341 --> 01:30:22,170
I'm avoiding sugar and that my number
one issue is he's fucking trader Joe's.

3371
01:30:22,171 --> 01:30:24,150
Mangoes with Chili on them.

3372
01:30:24,550 --> 01:30:24,870
They have.

3373
01:30:24,870 --> 01:30:25,920
I know it's got sugar in it.

3374
01:30:25,921 --> 01:30:27,160
I don't even want to read what David.

3375
01:30:27,230 --> 01:30:28,050
The sugar bro.

3376
01:30:28,050 --> 01:30:28,883
These things right here.

3377
01:30:29,290 --> 01:30:30,840
Do you like those Eddie?

3378
01:30:31,230 --> 01:30:32,130
I haven't had that.

3379
01:30:32,190 --> 01:30:32,371
Oh,

3380
01:30:32,371 --> 01:30:33,001
you get Eddie?

3381
01:30:33,001 --> 01:30:33,750
One of those too,

3382
01:30:33,750 --> 01:30:34,260
please.

3383
01:30:34,260 --> 01:30:35,093
Because I'm Mexican.

3384
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:36,433
Yes.

3385
01:30:36,690 --> 01:30:37,523
Yeah.

3386
01:30:37,730 --> 01:30:38,850
This shit is delicious.

3387
01:30:39,030 --> 01:30:40,110
Who makes this one a lot?

3388
01:30:40,630 --> 01:30:41,463
Next?

3389
01:30:41,700 --> 01:30:43,060
I know it's got sugar into.

3390
01:30:43,110 --> 01:30:44,040
What does it say on the back?

3391
01:30:44,470 --> 01:30:45,540
It's almost like it's so good.

3392
01:30:45,541 --> 01:30:46,110
It's like,

3393
01:30:46,110 --> 01:30:46,831
let's figure out what.

3394
01:30:46,831 --> 01:30:48,450
It doesn't have to put that.

3395
01:30:48,720 --> 01:30:50,340
Free cholesterol.

3396
01:30:50,341 --> 01:30:51,550
Free cholesterol.

3397
01:30:51,780 --> 01:30:52,650
Cholesterol free.

3398
01:30:53,190 --> 01:30:53,491
Well,

3399
01:30:53,491 --> 01:30:54,110
yeah,

3400
01:30:54,110 --> 01:30:55,400
of course is no cholesterol in it.

3401
01:30:55,410 --> 01:30:56,243
That's silly.

3402
01:30:56,910 --> 01:30:57,743
No.

3403
01:30:58,050 --> 01:30:59,910
Funny that it says No.

3404
01:31:00,250 --> 01:31:01,350
Nuclear energy.

3405
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:03,600
Merck non mercury.

3406
01:31:04,740 --> 01:31:05,850
That's hilarious.

3407
01:31:06,030 --> 01:31:07,560
No mangoes have mercury.

3408
01:31:07,590 --> 01:31:09,240
No mangoes have cholesterol.

3409
01:31:09,241 --> 01:31:14,241
Like what are you using butter to make
your mangoes cholesterol so stupid.

3410
01:31:15,630 --> 01:31:16,590
It's gluten free.

3411
01:31:16,591 --> 01:31:20,400
It better be shit if it's made out of
bread that it's not really a mango.

3412
01:31:20,401 --> 01:31:21,234
You Fuck

3413
01:31:22,440 --> 01:31:22,951
Eddie Bravo.

3414
01:31:22,951 --> 01:31:23,784
Opening it up.

3415
01:31:24,720 --> 01:31:28,050
Chico Caymus or a Gucci
for Gucci first fight.

3416
01:31:28,051 --> 01:31:30,660
Since he last mighty mouse
could be very interesting.

3417
01:31:30,661 --> 01:31:32,370
Hard Gucci's fast as shit to.

3418
01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:33,451
And Chico came.

3419
01:31:33,451 --> 01:31:34,290
It's pretty slick.

3420
01:31:34,380 --> 01:31:36,150
I thought Chico came look real good.

3421
01:31:36,550 --> 01:31:36,961
And his,

3422
01:31:36,961 --> 01:31:37,650
uh,

3423
01:31:37,650 --> 01:31:40,350
how much sugar intake.

3424
01:31:40,410 --> 01:31:42,120
The first ingredient is mango,

3425
01:31:42,270 --> 01:31:42,931
second ingredient.

3426
01:31:42,931 --> 01:31:43,290
Sugar,

3427
01:31:43,290 --> 01:31:44,490
sugar fuckers.

3428
01:31:45,210 --> 01:31:46,980
They didn't even try to hide it by saying

3429
01:31:49,750 --> 01:31:50,583
fuck it.

3430
01:31:50,820 --> 01:31:52,650
I wonder if one's better for you.

3431
01:31:53,160 --> 01:31:54,150
Heart Gootchie dude.

3432
01:31:54,151 --> 01:31:55,660
Heart Gucci's fighting Chico Caymus.

3433
01:31:55,740 --> 01:31:56,790
I forgot about this fight.

3434
01:31:57,210 --> 01:31:58,410
This is a good ass fight.

3435
01:31:59,020 --> 01:32:02,260
I thought Chico came look really
good against your boy Henry.

3436
01:32:02,270 --> 01:32:02,651
So hutto.

3437
01:32:02,651 --> 01:32:03,610
That was a great fight.

3438
01:32:04,030 --> 01:32:04,811
How bad was it?

3439
01:32:04,811 --> 01:32:04,990
Good.

3440
01:32:04,990 --> 01:32:06,370
How bad is bad?

3441
01:32:06,450 --> 01:32:09,070
Motherfucker combat or
artificial sweeteners.

3442
01:32:09,071 --> 01:32:12,820
When a co a soda companies advertise,

3443
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:14,350
we use real sugar.

3444
01:32:15,560 --> 01:32:17,060
Bad is appertain.

3445
01:32:17,140 --> 01:32:18,880
Jesus Christ this point in time,

3446
01:32:18,881 --> 01:32:20,560
that's all sugar people want,

3447
01:32:20,561 --> 01:32:21,394
man.

3448
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:22,620
I'm addicted to it bro.

3449
01:32:22,710 --> 01:32:23,120
I'm a dick.

3450
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:24,250
They weren't real sugar.

3451
01:32:24,460 --> 01:32:25,570
People want real sugar now,

3452
01:32:25,571 --> 01:32:25,840
man.

3453
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:26,011
They.

3454
01:32:26,011 --> 01:32:29,830
They feel like it's too risky
to get involved with aspartame.

3455
01:32:30,070 --> 01:32:31,090
All of it's bad for you,

3456
01:32:31,091 --> 01:32:31,750
dude.

3457
01:32:31,750 --> 01:32:35,950
The reality is you're only supposed to
get sugar from actual foods like sugar

3458
01:32:35,951 --> 01:32:36,784
from fruits,

3459
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:38,260
sugar from apples,

3460
01:32:38,261 --> 01:32:38,531
you know,

3461
01:32:38,531 --> 01:32:40,210
sugar from things that taste sweet.

3462
01:32:40,211 --> 01:32:41,500
That's how you're supposed
to get your sugar.

3463
01:32:41,770 --> 01:32:44,950
Like this creepy way that we've got
of like sucking all the sugar out and

3464
01:32:44,951 --> 01:32:45,940
stockpiling it,

3465
01:32:46,210 --> 01:32:50,110
and then injecting it directly into our
bloodstream and the foreign of candy

3466
01:32:50,410 --> 01:32:51,190
like that is.

3467
01:32:51,190 --> 01:32:52,023
That's a drug.

3468
01:32:52,030 --> 01:32:52,130
Oh,

3469
01:32:52,130 --> 01:32:52,760
it's beautiful.

3470
01:32:52,760 --> 01:32:53,593
And it's.

3471
01:32:55,960 --> 01:32:58,240
And it's completely alien to our system.

3472
01:32:58,330 --> 01:32:59,230
I feel great though,

3473
01:32:59,290 --> 01:33:00,700
but you know who needs it apparently.

3474
01:33:00,701 --> 01:33:04,070
Is those a super triathletes
and marathon runners and shit.

3475
01:33:04,300 --> 01:33:05,260
They need sugar dude.

3476
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:08,220
They say people who are real
explosive needed for the lights

3477
01:33:12,230 --> 01:33:13,150
to be explosive.

3478
01:33:13,390 --> 01:33:14,051
Who's that guy?

3479
01:33:14,051 --> 01:33:15,430
That was a body type.

3480
01:33:15,490 --> 01:33:17,740
Who's the guy that was fighting mma?

3481
01:33:17,770 --> 01:33:19,480
The fought Tim Silvia.

3482
01:33:19,481 --> 01:33:20,020
Tim Silvia.

3483
01:33:20,020 --> 01:33:21,550
Beat the fucking shit out of him.

3484
01:33:21,850 --> 01:33:23,440
He was the strongest man.

3485
01:33:24,030 --> 01:33:24,710
Ray Mercer.

3486
01:33:24,710 --> 01:33:24,960
No,

3487
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:25,793
no.

3488
01:33:26,050 --> 01:33:28,780
Hold a starts with a P.

3489
01:33:30,230 --> 01:33:31,360
I can't remember his name.

3490
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:32,200
Um,

3491
01:33:32,200 --> 01:33:32,911
he's strong man.

3492
01:33:32,911 --> 01:33:33,744
When right.

3493
01:33:33,910 --> 01:33:34,420
Poland.

3494
01:33:34,420 --> 01:33:35,970
He fought housekeeping.

3495
01:33:36,970 --> 01:33:37,803
Real meathead.

3496
01:33:37,900 --> 01:33:38,141
Yeah.

3497
01:33:38,141 --> 01:33:38,440
He's.

3498
01:33:38,440 --> 01:33:38,631
Oh,

3499
01:33:38,631 --> 01:33:39,940
he's the biggest of big.

3500
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:41,050
He's a giant dude.

3501
01:33:41,080 --> 01:33:42,160
Went 10 time world,

3502
01:33:42,161 --> 01:33:43,000
strongest bank context.

3503
01:33:43,001 --> 01:33:43,330
Some shit.

3504
01:33:43,330 --> 01:33:44,530
Super powerful dude.

3505
01:33:45,220 --> 01:33:46,360
And he hits a lot of candy.

3506
01:33:46,361 --> 01:33:47,100
Apparently.

3507
01:33:47,100 --> 01:33:49,360
He's a big part of his training,

3508
01:33:49,930 --> 01:33:53,490
but I guess he's just blowing his
sugar levels out of his muscles,

3509
01:33:53,491 --> 01:33:54,880
so not so much steroids,

3510
01:33:54,881 --> 01:33:55,360
so it don't.

3511
01:33:55,360 --> 01:33:56,470
It doesn't fucking matter.

3512
01:33:56,471 --> 01:33:56,580
What.

3513
01:33:56,580 --> 01:33:57,610
Do you remember that number?

3514
01:33:57,611 --> 01:34:02,611
That real buff guy that was the mascot
for the killing the cage normally do with

3515
01:34:02,780 --> 01:34:03,670
a huge bodybuilder.

3516
01:34:03,671 --> 01:34:05,560
So they would use them for like,

3517
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:07,780
like in between shots of like fights.

3518
01:34:07,870 --> 01:34:12,730
Why don't you explain how crazy that
was when I was down when he had a photo

3519
01:34:12,731 --> 01:34:15,550
shoot because I had to do like a photo
thing because I was a commentator so he

3520
01:34:15,610 --> 01:34:18,100
never got to knock out a bunch of photo
shoots and he's sitting there in the

3521
01:34:18,101 --> 01:34:23,101
waiting room with a gigantic bag of
skittles killing skittles and asked and he

3522
01:34:24,691 --> 01:34:25,390
said,

3523
01:34:25,390 --> 01:34:27,820
you got to get the biggest pump.

3524
01:34:28,090 --> 01:34:31,450
You need sugar running through
your veins to get the biggest pump.

3525
01:34:31,510 --> 01:34:32,350
Wow.

3526
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:34,113
Sugar

3527
01:34:35,380 --> 01:34:35,801
skittles.

3528
01:34:35,801 --> 01:34:36,910
Right before the photo shoot,

3529
01:34:36,940 --> 01:34:38,200
sugar makes the world go round.

3530
01:34:38,230 --> 01:34:40,360
These dudes that lift that much weight,

3531
01:34:40,390 --> 01:34:42,850
I think they just blow their
sugar out of their body.

3532
01:34:43,180 --> 01:34:43,541
I think,

3533
01:34:43,541 --> 01:34:43,740
you know,

3534
01:34:43,740 --> 01:34:45,430
their requirements are just so high.

3535
01:34:45,610 --> 01:34:49,780
But how crazy was that king of the cage
thing because the whole thing was they

3536
01:34:49,781 --> 01:34:54,781
had these mma fights and then they had
this guy that was supposed to be the king

3537
01:34:54,941 --> 01:34:58,070
of the cage and the guy who supposed
to be the king of the cage was

3538
01:34:58,070 --> 01:34:59,510
just an actor or a bodybuilder.

3539
01:34:59,690 --> 01:35:00,610
So did you Jitsu.

3540
01:35:00,780 --> 01:35:01,050
But.

3541
01:35:01,050 --> 01:35:02,090
But he wasn't fighting.

3542
01:35:02,330 --> 01:35:03,111
He wasn't the king.

3543
01:35:03,111 --> 01:35:04,970
It wasn't like he was the guy
that was at the top of the heat.

3544
01:35:04,971 --> 01:35:07,490
He was the guy that locked
the cage before the fights.

3545
01:35:07,660 --> 01:35:07,790
Yeah,

3546
01:35:07,790 --> 01:35:08,210
but how.

3547
01:35:08,210 --> 01:35:09,500
But it wasn't his organization.

3548
01:35:09,501 --> 01:35:11,570
He was just the guy that
terry and bud hire guys.

3549
01:35:11,810 --> 01:35:12,643
Awesome.

3550
01:35:13,220 --> 01:35:13,910
What,

3551
01:35:13,910 --> 01:35:14,930
what was his boss?

3552
01:35:14,950 --> 01:35:16,010
Ruden owned.

3553
01:35:16,070 --> 01:35:16,851
He was part owner,

3554
01:35:16,851 --> 01:35:17,684
right in the first one.

3555
01:35:17,780 --> 01:35:19,220
So the logo was like boss

3556
01:35:21,510 --> 01:35:25,520
when boss Rutan bolted
from King of the cage.

3557
01:35:25,700 --> 01:35:27,020
They kept the logo,

3558
01:35:27,021 --> 01:35:28,880
but then they just turned
it into a real dude.

3559
01:35:29,480 --> 01:35:30,300
That's hilarious.

3560
01:35:30,300 --> 01:35:32,660
These things are a mother fucker so good.

3561
01:35:32,661 --> 01:35:33,920
So I'm going to eat this entire bag.

3562
01:35:33,921 --> 01:35:34,581
Of course you are.

3563
01:35:34,581 --> 01:35:35,740
I told you this is my problem.

3564
01:35:35,750 --> 01:35:40,750
I think my mom had like maple syrup and
activities when I was a straight up man.

3565
01:35:41,020 --> 01:35:42,560
I cannot get enough of it.

3566
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:43,461
Oh,

3567
01:35:43,461 --> 01:35:44,420
that's so silly.

3568
01:35:44,510 --> 01:35:44,870
Meanwhile,

3569
01:35:44,870 --> 01:35:45,703
this is a good fight.

3570
01:35:46,040 --> 01:35:47,330
Chico caymus and hard Gucci.

3571
01:35:47,390 --> 01:35:48,201
I'm not gonna lie to you guys.

3572
01:35:48,201 --> 01:35:49,800
I haven't watched one single thing.

3573
01:35:49,940 --> 01:35:51,830
Heart Gucci's fast as fuck man.

3574
01:35:52,910 --> 01:35:55,040
My guys remember these.

3575
01:35:55,310 --> 01:35:58,930
I'm sitting here listening to you
guys talking about fights and I don't.

3576
01:35:58,940 --> 01:36:01,370
I feel like I'm not a real fan.

3577
01:36:01,900 --> 01:36:02,733
No,

3578
01:36:04,130 --> 01:36:06,350
you're running 100
fucking Jujitsu schools,

3579
01:36:06,710 --> 01:36:07,543
you know,

3580
01:36:07,730 --> 01:36:08,380
but you're,

3581
01:36:08,380 --> 01:36:08,800
you're,

3582
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:12,470
you're 100 times more busy
than I am and so are you.

3583
01:36:12,510 --> 01:36:12,980
Yeah,

3584
01:36:12,980 --> 01:36:14,660
but this is my job.

3585
01:36:14,700 --> 01:36:15,830
It's part of our job.

3586
01:36:15,950 --> 01:36:16,191
I mean,

3587
01:36:16,191 --> 01:36:20,140
my job especially I'm the
commentator for the UFC right now.

3588
01:36:20,270 --> 01:36:21,103
There's no,

3589
01:36:21,440 --> 01:36:21,830
no,

3590
01:36:21,830 --> 01:36:23,070
there's no way you could.

3591
01:36:23,150 --> 01:36:27,110
You can have all that information about
all these fights and fighters and what

3592
01:36:27,111 --> 01:36:28,590
happened in these fights
in the second round.

3593
01:36:28,620 --> 01:36:29,453
The third round.

3594
01:36:29,580 --> 01:36:30,340
Rocketship.

3595
01:36:30,340 --> 01:36:31,460
Unless you watch them again.

3596
01:36:31,490 --> 01:36:32,323
Well that's why

3597
01:36:33,650 --> 01:36:36,460
you watch it some twice.

3598
01:36:36,670 --> 01:36:37,580
You watch them twice.

3599
01:36:37,670 --> 01:36:38,660
It depends on the fight.

3600
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:41,000
There's somebody I want too much.

3601
01:36:41,001 --> 01:36:41,834
Dude,

3602
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:42,830
I got to.

3603
01:36:42,830 --> 01:36:44,270
You have no time for shit.

3604
01:36:45,650 --> 01:36:46,421
He doesn't sleep,

3605
01:36:46,421 --> 01:36:48,290
but I wonder if you
haven't watched narcos yet.

3606
01:36:49,220 --> 01:36:50,210
I just remember them.

3607
01:36:50,211 --> 01:36:51,044
Dude.

3608
01:36:51,210 --> 01:36:52,940
It's a different thing
when you're calling fights,

3609
01:36:52,941 --> 01:36:55,610
especially when you're calling fights you.

3610
01:36:55,611 --> 01:36:56,780
You remember more.

3611
01:36:57,470 --> 01:36:58,080
Okay,

3612
01:36:58,080 --> 01:36:58,913
that makes sense.

3613
01:36:58,970 --> 01:36:59,241
Dude.

3614
01:36:59,241 --> 01:37:00,100
You don't fight tonight,

3615
01:37:00,110 --> 01:37:02,860
so don't say wilder memory.

3616
01:37:02,870 --> 01:37:03,591
Extraordinary.

3617
01:37:03,591 --> 01:37:04,424
That's the thing.

3618
01:37:04,950 --> 01:37:05,783
You and Brent,

3619
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:06,680
do you watch it twice.

3620
01:37:06,860 --> 01:37:07,700
Are you watching all day?

3621
01:37:07,790 --> 01:37:10,020
You wake up and I got to watch it as it

3622
01:37:11,970 --> 01:37:12,260
as it.

3623
01:37:12,260 --> 01:37:12,531
Come on,

3624
01:37:12,531 --> 01:37:12,760
man.

3625
01:37:12,760 --> 01:37:15,290
You have to have a good
memory to be a comic,

3626
01:37:15,470 --> 01:37:19,100
to do an hour long set and to do a
new hour long set every year or so.

3627
01:37:19,310 --> 01:37:20,061
You gotta change it up.

3628
01:37:20,061 --> 01:37:21,860
You have to remember old shit.

3629
01:37:21,861 --> 01:37:22,880
You have to remember new shit.

3630
01:37:23,170 --> 01:37:23,650
You have to.

3631
01:37:23,650 --> 01:37:25,520
You have to be able to rememorized things.

3632
01:37:26,030 --> 01:37:27,860
You have to your super targeted.

3633
01:37:29,490 --> 01:37:30,323
Um,

3634
01:37:31,400 --> 01:37:34,580
how do you deal with
your children farting?

3635
01:37:34,740 --> 01:37:35,890
Do Laugh at that.

3636
01:37:35,891 --> 01:37:36,710
Do you laugh?

3637
01:37:36,710 --> 01:37:37,480
It's hilarious.

3638
01:37:37,480 --> 01:37:38,720
The five-year-olds figured out.

3639
01:37:38,721 --> 01:37:39,381
It's hilarious though.

3640
01:37:39,381 --> 01:37:42,140
Now you won't stop farting.

3641
01:37:42,280 --> 01:37:45,000
So my wife gets bummed out
and I think it's hilarious.

3642
01:37:45,040 --> 01:37:48,140
I'm laughing so there's no cooperation.

3643
01:37:48,410 --> 01:37:49,460
So the five year old,

3644
01:37:49,461 --> 01:37:50,330
the other day she,

3645
01:37:50,390 --> 01:37:52,070
she's in bed reading stories.

3646
01:37:52,160 --> 01:37:56,060
She grabs the back of her knees
roles or bumped in there and blast

3647
01:37:56,070 --> 01:37:59,280
went up to the fucking howling.

3648
01:37:59,460 --> 01:38:00,293
I think it's

3649
01:38:02,260 --> 01:38:02,990
funny.

3650
01:38:02,990 --> 01:38:04,710
It's an absolutely funny,

3651
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:07,610
but she tells them she doesn't think I
should necessarily encourage it and she

3652
01:38:07,620 --> 01:38:08,910
said you shouldn't far and I'll say,

3653
01:38:08,911 --> 01:38:09,150
hey,

3654
01:38:09,150 --> 01:38:09,390
all right,

3655
01:38:09,390 --> 01:38:10,223
you got to stop farting.

3656
01:38:10,350 --> 01:38:12,750
But the problem is in my house,

3657
01:38:13,890 --> 01:38:16,710
like laughter is valued very,

3658
01:38:16,711 --> 01:38:17,131
very,

3659
01:38:17,131 --> 01:38:18,870
very heavy in my house.

3660
01:38:18,871 --> 01:38:19,970
It's always laughter.

3661
01:38:20,310 --> 01:38:24,210
We laugh about everything and we joke
around about stuff all the time and we're

3662
01:38:24,211 --> 01:38:24,960
always like,

3663
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:25,481
like if,

3664
01:38:25,481 --> 01:38:26,460
if something goes wrong,

3665
01:38:26,461 --> 01:38:27,420
even if something goes wrong,

3666
01:38:27,421 --> 01:38:29,550
they do something that they shouldn't do.

3667
01:38:29,800 --> 01:38:31,290
There's always some laughter involved.

3668
01:38:31,590 --> 01:38:32,190
Always.

3669
01:38:32,190 --> 01:38:33,300
So like when,

3670
01:38:33,360 --> 01:38:37,270
when she finds out that she could
make us fucking howl laughing,

3671
01:38:39,240 --> 01:38:40,280
they just start doing stuff.

3672
01:38:40,660 --> 01:38:41,570
Think it's funny.

3673
01:38:41,890 --> 01:38:42,571
Here's the argument,

3674
01:38:42,571 --> 01:38:42,661
Joe,

3675
01:38:42,661 --> 01:38:44,760
don't you want it to be lady
like she goes to middle school,

3676
01:38:44,761 --> 01:38:45,510
starts ripping fart.

3677
01:38:45,510 --> 01:38:49,050
She got the shitty girl and I wanted to
be a nice person and I want him to be

3678
01:38:49,051 --> 01:38:49,500
whoever,

3679
01:38:49,500 --> 01:38:50,820
however she wants to be.

3680
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:55,110
As long as she interacted with people
would be ripping farts in school.

3681
01:38:55,111 --> 01:38:55,621
Listen Bro,

3682
01:38:55,621 --> 01:38:56,940
do you rip farts in school?

3683
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:57,690
Come on.

3684
01:38:57,690 --> 01:38:58,680
Exactly right.

3685
01:38:58,681 --> 01:39:00,330
But when you were at your
house and someone says,

3686
01:39:00,331 --> 01:39:00,570
all right,

3687
01:39:00,570 --> 01:39:03,960
well you can't rip those farts when
you're in the teacher's office.

3688
01:39:03,961 --> 01:39:04,640
Okay,

3689
01:39:04,640 --> 01:39:07,800
do all you have to do is teach the
kid went a fart and when not to Fart.

3690
01:39:08,130 --> 01:39:10,380
That's why I think also
teaching them about swearing.

3691
01:39:10,620 --> 01:39:12,630
Like don't keep swearing from them.

3692
01:39:12,810 --> 01:39:13,610
Just tell them.

3693
01:39:13,610 --> 01:39:16,770
You will notice when daddy talks
to the guy at the Lexus dealership,

3694
01:39:16,771 --> 01:39:20,370
notice how daddy doesn't use
the word because you can't say,

3695
01:39:20,371 --> 01:39:21,810
come to the Lexus guy.

3696
01:39:22,140 --> 01:39:22,771
You know you gotta.

3697
01:39:22,771 --> 01:39:27,030
You gotta know when to be appropriate
and when not to be appropriate but don't

3698
01:39:27,100 --> 01:39:29,850
because you don't want them
figuring out through other people,

3699
01:39:29,970 --> 01:39:30,803
you know,

3700
01:39:31,290 --> 01:39:35,310
why should you hide anything from your
kids if you think that it's okay to use

3701
01:39:35,311 --> 01:39:36,090
certain words,

3702
01:39:36,090 --> 01:39:37,740
you should use those
words in front of kids,

3703
01:39:37,950 --> 01:39:42,900
but you should use them when you think
they're able to discern when to and when

3704
01:39:42,901 --> 01:39:43,590
not to use them.

3705
01:39:43,590 --> 01:39:44,800
So I swear,

3706
01:39:44,920 --> 01:39:48,810
I've very rarely do I accidentally
fuck up and swear in front of the kids.

3707
01:39:48,811 --> 01:39:50,160
So you try not to try.

3708
01:39:50,161 --> 01:39:51,150
Not to say,

3709
01:39:51,330 --> 01:39:55,500
but as time goes on I will
absolutely start swearing.

3710
01:39:55,501 --> 01:39:55,621
Well,

3711
01:39:55,621 --> 01:39:56,100
not yet.

3712
01:39:56,100 --> 01:39:56,933
Not yet though.

3713
01:39:57,720 --> 01:40:00,000
That little ones in every
now and then an accident.

3714
01:40:00,130 --> 01:40:01,140
No accident,

3715
01:40:01,141 --> 01:40:02,070
but sometimes not.

3716
01:40:02,250 --> 01:40:02,701
Sometimes.

3717
01:40:02,701 --> 01:40:03,220
Not on next.

3718
01:40:03,220 --> 01:40:04,480
What kind of swear word we talked to.

3719
01:40:04,481 --> 01:40:06,250
They're like occasional fuck.

3720
01:40:06,270 --> 01:40:08,210
And every now and then
a shit that's not bad.

3721
01:40:08,460 --> 01:40:10,800
But even the fuck is cheese
because they repeated it yet?

3722
01:40:10,950 --> 01:40:11,310
No,

3723
01:40:11,310 --> 01:40:11,610
no,

3724
01:40:11,610 --> 01:40:12,900
but the shit one when,

3725
01:40:13,300 --> 01:40:14,880
when the little one was three.

3726
01:40:15,150 --> 01:40:16,380
This was hilarious dude.

3727
01:40:16,381 --> 01:40:16,860
We were,

3728
01:40:16,860 --> 01:40:17,191
we were,

3729
01:40:17,191 --> 01:40:18,024
um,

3730
01:40:18,120 --> 01:40:19,820
we were skiing and uh,

3731
01:40:19,860 --> 01:40:21,090
we put all our stuff in the bag.

3732
01:40:21,091 --> 01:40:24,330
We were leaving and she forgot
to pack her helmet and I go,

3733
01:40:24,331 --> 01:40:24,890
honey,

3734
01:40:24,890 --> 01:40:26,040
you forgot to put your helmet in there.

3735
01:40:26,280 --> 01:40:27,113
And she goes,

3736
01:40:27,780 --> 01:40:28,613
Shit,

3737
01:40:31,110 --> 01:40:32,820
my wife just bit her hand.

3738
01:40:32,830 --> 01:40:33,271
She turned away.

3739
01:40:33,271 --> 01:40:34,104
She didn't want to laugh.

3740
01:40:34,110 --> 01:40:37,080
And I went and I turned and looked away.

3741
01:40:37,081 --> 01:40:37,450
I'm like,

3742
01:40:37,450 --> 01:40:37,830
it was,

3743
01:40:37,830 --> 01:40:39,770
she didn't know how funny it was to her.

3744
01:40:39,810 --> 01:40:41,740
It was just a normal shit.

3745
01:40:42,060 --> 01:40:42,780
That's great.

3746
01:40:42,780 --> 01:40:43,980
But to hear it three year olds say,

3747
01:40:43,990 --> 01:40:44,660
ah,

3748
01:40:44,660 --> 01:40:46,470
what's weird is around my wife.

3749
01:40:46,920 --> 01:40:47,370
Uh,

3750
01:40:47,370 --> 01:40:48,203
he is,

3751
01:40:48,280 --> 01:40:49,500
she doesn't laugh,

3752
01:40:49,501 --> 01:40:50,940
she doesn't want to
encourage like laughter.

3753
01:40:50,941 --> 01:40:53,620
She's trying to teach them
to be proper but around me,

3754
01:40:53,621 --> 01:40:54,040
he knows

3755
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:54,731
he could fart.

3756
01:40:54,731 --> 01:40:59,731
And I laughing and just me and him
have far too far back and forth.

3757
01:41:00,580 --> 01:41:04,150
We're high fiving each other with foster
moms around wearing the bathroom and

3758
01:41:04,151 --> 01:41:04,960
then he farts.

3759
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:08,380
I got to hold it in and he's looking at
me and I got to keep a straight face.

3760
01:41:08,990 --> 01:41:09,401
He's like,

3761
01:41:09,401 --> 01:41:11,050
don't throw me under the bus over here.

3762
01:41:11,070 --> 01:41:11,903
And I'm like,

3763
01:41:11,950 --> 01:41:13,070
I don't want to hear it from her.

3764
01:41:14,110 --> 01:41:16,840
And then she's looking at me
knowing that I'm holding it in.

3765
01:41:18,140 --> 01:41:19,900
He feels so confident around me.

3766
01:41:19,901 --> 01:41:22,120
Like when when daddy's around
he could just blow those.

3767
01:41:22,180 --> 01:41:24,370
So that's a problem that we're having.

3768
01:41:24,430 --> 01:41:25,090
We're having a.

3769
01:41:25,090 --> 01:41:25,901
that's so funny.

3770
01:41:25,901 --> 01:41:27,010
We're having a problem.

3771
01:41:30,380 --> 01:41:31,900
I think if you can hold them in,

3772
01:41:31,901 --> 01:41:33,550
it's like it's a nice thing to do.

3773
01:41:34,280 --> 01:41:36,250
It's hard enough holding my farts in.

3774
01:41:36,430 --> 01:41:38,560
It's hard enough holding
my farts in around my wife.

3775
01:41:38,561 --> 01:41:39,310
I have to hold.

3776
01:41:39,310 --> 01:41:39,760
She,

3777
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:39,971
she,

3778
01:41:39,971 --> 01:41:41,020
I don't want to fart around her.

3779
01:41:41,021 --> 01:41:41,854
She doesn't want me to start,

3780
01:41:42,040 --> 01:41:44,260
but I'm not going to hold my
farts in around my son too.

3781
01:41:44,830 --> 01:41:48,430
That's like having two
wives around my son.

3782
01:41:48,431 --> 01:41:49,111
He's going to get it.

3783
01:41:49,111 --> 01:41:53,740
I'm not holding shit and I'm going
to blow his fucking ass around.

3784
01:41:57,540 --> 01:42:01,560
Another headline and the parts around son,

3785
01:42:04,440 --> 01:42:05,620
it's hard enough for the line.

3786
01:42:05,650 --> 01:42:06,191
Oh Dude.

3787
01:42:06,191 --> 01:42:06,701
Horror Gucci.

3788
01:42:06,701 --> 01:42:07,534
Just tag.

3789
01:42:07,990 --> 01:42:09,400
This is a great scrap man.

3790
01:42:09,401 --> 01:42:11,800
We're missing out on all
the flights have been crazy.

3791
01:42:11,801 --> 01:42:12,280
They have.

3792
01:42:12,280 --> 01:42:15,930
We're just talking about
foreign Dr Octopus for

3793
01:42:17,810 --> 01:42:18,643
headline.

3794
01:42:19,670 --> 01:42:23,770
And I said before this podcast that this
podcast would not be a regular podcast,

3795
01:42:23,771 --> 01:42:24,604
but it kind of is.

3796
01:42:25,500 --> 01:42:27,130
It's not a fight companion podcast.

3797
01:42:27,131 --> 01:42:27,964
That's the big lie.

3798
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:31,400
Were barely talking about
fights people talk shit about,

3799
01:42:31,410 --> 01:42:33,190
but we haven't seen each other in a while.

3800
01:42:33,191 --> 01:42:34,024
Folks.

3801
01:42:34,660 --> 01:42:35,493
Fun

3802
01:42:38,380 --> 01:42:39,220
People do get mad,

3803
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,610
but you don't have to
listen for the most part.

3804
01:42:42,611 --> 01:42:43,120
It's all polished.

3805
01:42:43,120 --> 01:42:46,030
Chico caymus looks super
good in this fight.

3806
01:42:46,240 --> 01:42:47,230
As those horror Gucci,

3807
01:42:47,231 --> 01:42:48,940
they're tagging each other out.

3808
01:42:49,170 --> 01:42:49,480
Harwood,

3809
01:42:49,480 --> 01:42:50,890
she's got that crazy wide stance.

3810
01:42:50,891 --> 01:42:53,290
Like what time is it over
there in Japan right now?

3811
01:42:54,070 --> 01:42:54,903
11.

3812
01:42:55,630 --> 01:42:59,290
11 am started early for
viewing pleasure dude.

3813
01:42:59,320 --> 01:43:01,570
Big right hand there by her Gucci.

3814
01:43:01,960 --> 01:43:03,190
This eliminate him now Eddie.

3815
01:43:03,640 --> 01:43:04,421
Something like that.

3816
01:43:04,421 --> 01:43:05,020
So it's probably,

3817
01:43:05,020 --> 01:43:06,790
it probably started at
like nine or something.

3818
01:43:07,340 --> 01:43:08,770
If you're in those prelims,

3819
01:43:09,040 --> 01:43:10,390
you're waking up early.

3820
01:43:10,420 --> 01:43:11,170
Do you adjust?

3821
01:43:11,170 --> 01:43:12,130
You must adjust.

3822
01:43:12,250 --> 01:43:13,910
I'm like way in advance.

3823
01:43:14,870 --> 01:43:15,431
Your instagram,

3824
01:43:15,431 --> 01:43:16,810
you're doing Jujitsu at
seven in the morning.

3825
01:43:16,811 --> 01:43:17,710
What the fuck's up with that?

3826
01:43:17,940 --> 01:43:18,773
So I roll man.

3827
01:43:19,060 --> 01:43:19,820
What time do you wake?

3828
01:43:19,820 --> 01:43:20,010
Really?

3829
01:43:20,010 --> 01:43:24,470
Just gets up at seven and takes a
photo and puts it up the night before.

3830
01:43:24,580 --> 01:43:25,413
Yeah,

3831
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:27,730
it's like seven in the morning.

3832
01:43:27,731 --> 01:43:28,420
I can't sleep.

3833
01:43:28,420 --> 01:43:29,780
I usually wake up already all night.

3834
01:43:29,920 --> 01:43:30,940
I usually wake up early.

3835
01:43:31,780 --> 01:43:33,310
You do Jujitsu at seven in the morning?

3836
01:43:33,311 --> 01:43:33,730
Yeah.

3837
01:43:33,730 --> 01:43:34,240
Jesus,

3838
01:43:34,240 --> 01:43:35,140
you're one of those dudes.

3839
01:43:35,190 --> 01:43:37,030
Got guys like that man.

3840
01:43:37,260 --> 01:43:40,740
I was letting your boy in a dozen.

3841
01:43:40,760 --> 01:43:41,290
Um,

3842
01:43:41,290 --> 01:43:41,630
your,

3843
01:43:41,630 --> 01:43:42,940
your boy down in San Diego.

3844
01:43:43,600 --> 01:43:44,880
Boogie Boogie.

3845
01:43:44,890 --> 01:43:46,470
Have a 6:00 AM six.

3846
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:47,793
Switched it up though.

3847
01:43:47,800 --> 01:43:48,341
I think he,

3848
01:43:48,341 --> 01:43:51,800
I finally broke down and I think
he doesn't do that anymore.

3849
01:43:51,801 --> 01:43:52,220
That's

3850
01:43:52,220 --> 01:43:53,510
6:00 AM Jiu Jitsu.

3851
01:43:53,870 --> 01:43:54,591
But there are people.

3852
01:43:54,591 --> 01:43:55,700
Thank God there are people like you.

3853
01:43:55,760 --> 01:43:57,410
I follow a on instagram.

3854
01:43:58,850 --> 01:44:00,640
Boogie woogie piano.

3855
01:44:00,840 --> 01:44:01,431
Got Shit.

3856
01:44:01,431 --> 01:44:03,200
I'm not trying to do too
much shit at 7:00 AM,

3857
01:44:03,230 --> 01:44:04,640
but I liked that though.

3858
01:44:04,641 --> 01:44:04,911
Man.

3859
01:44:04,911 --> 01:44:06,140
I like to get a good workout in,

3860
01:44:06,141 --> 01:44:06,850
in the morning too.

3861
01:44:06,850 --> 01:44:07,640
I feel good.

3862
01:44:07,640 --> 01:44:08,960
What time do you wake up these days?

3863
01:44:09,290 --> 01:44:11,150
Depends if I have to
take the kids to school,

3864
01:44:11,420 --> 01:44:11,950
you know,

3865
01:44:11,950 --> 01:44:12,770
it depends,

3866
01:44:12,770 --> 01:44:13,670
but a lot of times,

3867
01:44:13,671 --> 01:44:13,980
uh,

3868
01:44:13,980 --> 01:44:14,240
I,

3869
01:44:14,240 --> 01:44:15,073
I'll take,

3870
01:44:15,110 --> 01:44:16,350
I'll take like 8:00 Jujitsu,

3871
01:44:16,610 --> 01:44:18,920
8:00 yoga class really got.

3872
01:44:19,140 --> 01:44:20,540
I really want to start doing yoga,

3873
01:44:20,560 --> 01:44:21,393
man.

3874
01:44:22,600 --> 01:44:24,350
I'm being lazy when it comes to Yoga,

3875
01:44:24,380 --> 01:44:26,150
getting very close to being
able to do Jujitsu again.

3876
01:44:26,151 --> 01:44:27,650
My shoulders not bothering me anymore.

3877
01:44:27,680 --> 01:44:29,540
I'm going to get another
MRI to get it looked at,

3878
01:44:29,541 --> 01:44:30,410
but ever since the uh,

3879
01:44:30,440 --> 01:44:31,430
is this deontay wilder?

3880
01:44:31,880 --> 01:44:33,800
It's just the highlights
is a fight over already.

3881
01:44:34,070 --> 01:44:34,501
Oh Wow.

3882
01:44:34,501 --> 01:44:35,331
They got fucked up.

3883
01:44:35,331 --> 01:44:35,660
Dude.

3884
01:44:35,660 --> 01:44:37,940
Was dancing big fucking black eyes,

3885
01:44:37,941 --> 01:44:38,160
man.

3886
01:44:38,160 --> 01:44:38,860
Look at his eyes.

3887
01:44:38,860 --> 01:44:39,470
Oh Shit.

3888
01:44:39,470 --> 01:44:40,303
Oh Shit.

3889
01:44:40,390 --> 01:44:41,420
Oh God.

3890
01:44:41,500 --> 01:44:41,761
Wow.

3891
01:44:41,761 --> 01:44:42,260
They're crack.

3892
01:44:42,260 --> 01:44:42,921
Oh my God.

3893
01:44:42,921 --> 01:44:43,731
He got cracked.

3894
01:44:43,731 --> 01:44:44,564
Do Crazy story.

3895
01:44:45,420 --> 01:44:46,730
He has a decision.

3896
01:44:46,731 --> 01:44:48,320
When was it a decision?

3897
01:44:49,340 --> 01:44:50,061
11th round.

3898
01:44:50,061 --> 01:44:50,510
Tko.

3899
01:44:50,510 --> 01:44:51,350
He stopped him in the 11th.

3900
01:44:51,351 --> 01:44:54,260
Round on taste for real fucking monster,

3901
01:44:54,261 --> 01:44:54,471
man.

3902
01:44:54,471 --> 01:44:56,090
I want to fight in that long.

3903
01:44:56,420 --> 01:44:57,111
I got recorded.

3904
01:44:57,111 --> 01:44:57,944
I'm going to see that.

3905
01:44:58,120 --> 01:44:58,953
I love watching them.

3906
01:44:59,060 --> 01:44:59,361
Wow.

3907
01:44:59,361 --> 01:45:01,190
He got a serious fucking black eye.

3908
01:45:01,280 --> 01:45:01,911
I fucked up.

3909
01:45:01,911 --> 01:45:02,361
I didn't want.

3910
01:45:02,361 --> 01:45:03,170
I didn't record it.

3911
01:45:03,170 --> 01:45:03,730
Goddammit.

3912
01:45:03,730 --> 01:45:03,920
Who?

3913
01:45:03,920 --> 01:45:06,140
I don't miss some NBC boxing.

3914
01:45:06,250 --> 01:45:06,370
Well,

3915
01:45:06,370 --> 01:45:07,760
wasn't there another fight on tonight?

3916
01:45:07,761 --> 01:45:08,390
Is near another,

3917
01:45:08,390 --> 01:45:09,770
another boxing match on tonight.

3918
01:45:10,940 --> 01:45:12,980
Is there something on Hbo Tonight as well?

3919
01:45:13,460 --> 01:45:14,570
Or is it just as much snow?

3920
01:45:14,571 --> 01:45:15,404
This was the big one.

3921
01:45:16,360 --> 01:45:17,450
Here's a great story though.

3922
01:45:17,451 --> 01:45:20,180
He's trained for like three years
and that falls on the Olympic team.

3923
01:45:20,540 --> 01:45:21,300
It's crazy.

3924
01:45:21,300 --> 01:45:21,630
Yeah.

3925
01:45:21,630 --> 01:45:23,090
He's getting ready to all the time,

3926
01:45:23,480 --> 01:45:23,930
you know,

3927
01:45:23,930 --> 01:45:24,501
he was,

3928
01:45:24,501 --> 01:45:25,334
um,

3929
01:45:26,380 --> 01:45:27,230
it's really interesting.

3930
01:45:27,980 --> 01:45:28,661
It was one of the guys.

3931
01:45:28,661 --> 01:45:30,140
It was in line for Tyson fury,

3932
01:45:30,380 --> 01:45:31,071
Tyson fury.

3933
01:45:31,071 --> 01:45:35,750
They offered him this fight and instead
he took the Vladimir Klitschko fight and

3934
01:45:35,751 --> 01:45:39,050
Vladimir fucked as Catholic now
in public now is less bone now.

3935
01:45:39,051 --> 01:45:39,884
He's uh,

3936
01:45:40,010 --> 01:45:40,760
you know,

3937
01:45:40,760 --> 01:45:41,630
he shit out of luck,

3938
01:45:41,810 --> 01:45:43,070
but I think while they're smart,

3939
01:45:43,190 --> 01:45:43,521
you know,

3940
01:45:43,521 --> 01:45:45,350
not taking the fight with Klitschko yet,

3941
01:45:45,410 --> 01:45:46,141
he's not ready for it.

3942
01:45:46,141 --> 01:45:46,370
Well,

3943
01:45:46,370 --> 01:45:46,821
he's just,

3944
01:45:46,821 --> 01:45:47,090
you know,

3945
01:45:47,090 --> 01:45:51,230
he's getting ready and Klitschko
is older unless he's doing drugs,

3946
01:45:51,680 --> 01:45:51,981
you know,

3947
01:45:51,981 --> 01:45:52,551
that's the thing.

3948
01:45:52,551 --> 01:45:53,570
And I'm not saying that he is,

3949
01:45:53,571 --> 01:45:54,650
but I'm not saying he isn't.

3950
01:45:54,750 --> 01:45:55,400
I agree.

3951
01:45:55,400 --> 01:45:56,600
He's 39 years old.

3952
01:45:56,680 --> 01:45:59,810
He looks fucking amazing and I just,

3953
01:45:59,930 --> 01:46:00,651
I don't know.

3954
01:46:00,651 --> 01:46:01,700
I don't know who's doing what.

3955
01:46:01,910 --> 01:46:03,260
You can't speculate,

3956
01:46:03,470 --> 01:46:06,370
but this is the reason
for bringing it up though,

3957
01:46:06,500 --> 01:46:07,970
because if he is doing drugs,

3958
01:46:08,030 --> 01:46:11,180
he can keep that high level
for a much longer time.

3959
01:46:11,330 --> 01:46:12,200
Especially at heavyweight.

3960
01:46:12,201 --> 01:46:12,500
Yeah.

3961
01:46:12,500 --> 01:46:13,910
If he's not doing drugs,

3962
01:46:14,180 --> 01:46:15,860
you got to wonder how
much time he has left.

3963
01:46:16,190 --> 01:46:17,300
Thirty nine years of age.

3964
01:46:17,540 --> 01:46:19,220
The wheels can fall off at any moment.

3965
01:46:19,221 --> 01:46:20,990
He'll make you guys hundreds of fights.

3966
01:46:21,050 --> 01:46:23,890
You have to think about his
amateur career and this procreate.

3967
01:46:23,900 --> 01:46:27,350
I think he's 63 and three
or some shit like that.

3968
01:46:27,370 --> 01:46:27,500
Well,

3969
01:46:27,500 --> 01:46:31,490
his brother was a competitive
kickboxer and I think he was too.

3970
01:46:31,610 --> 01:46:33,170
I want to say he wasn't.

3971
01:46:33,240 --> 01:46:34,080
It was just kicked.

3972
01:46:34,390 --> 01:46:35,510
No kickboxing,

3973
01:46:35,520 --> 01:46:36,201
kill his brother.

3974
01:46:36,201 --> 01:46:39,260
Fought PKA karate style above the waist.

3975
01:46:39,261 --> 01:46:41,990
Kickbox cheese with the
crazy long pants on.

3976
01:46:42,230 --> 01:46:43,580
He must have been a motherfucker.

3977
01:46:43,670 --> 01:46:44,031
Yeah,

3978
01:46:44,031 --> 01:46:45,170
he was a bad motherfucker.

3979
01:46:45,200 --> 01:46:49,530
He actually got knocked out in kickboxing
and like that PKA karate style.

3980
01:46:49,890 --> 01:46:51,120
I forget who he fought.

3981
01:46:51,220 --> 01:46:51,631
He fought.

3982
01:46:51,631 --> 01:46:52,590
Some guy was.

3983
01:46:52,970 --> 01:46:55,800
I feel like he got knocked
out by a kick look up.

3984
01:46:55,800 --> 01:46:57,540
Vitali Klitschko gets.

3985
01:46:58,460 --> 01:46:58,890
Dude.

3986
01:46:58,890 --> 01:46:59,330
I,

3987
01:46:59,330 --> 01:47:00,800
I love watching the political fight.

3988
01:47:01,140 --> 01:47:01,830
Don't miss one.

3989
01:47:01,830 --> 01:47:03,660
He was an animal man
when he was at his best.

3990
01:47:03,661 --> 01:47:05,460
I watched the Shannon
breaks fight the other day.

3991
01:47:05,461 --> 01:47:06,310
Him and Shannon breaks.

3992
01:47:06,790 --> 01:47:07,650
What a war.

3993
01:47:08,070 --> 01:47:08,970
Jesus Christ.

3994
01:47:08,971 --> 01:47:11,640
You guys keep up with boxing and UFC.

3995
01:47:12,560 --> 01:47:13,220
Shannon's great.

3996
01:47:13,220 --> 01:47:13,320
Right?

3997
01:47:13,320 --> 01:47:13,610
You know,

3998
01:47:13,610 --> 01:47:14,443
we talked about,

3999
01:47:15,010 --> 01:47:18,240
I talked about Shannon Briggs on the
podcast recently and she had briggs,

4000
01:47:18,280 --> 01:47:18,690
uh,

4001
01:47:18,690 --> 01:47:19,140
uh,

4002
01:47:19,140 --> 01:47:21,600
went back and forth with him
on instagram now about what?

4003
01:47:21,630 --> 01:47:23,070
A couple of times because he's,

4004
01:47:23,250 --> 01:47:24,083
he's awesome man.

4005
01:47:24,300 --> 01:47:25,860
He's every video he does.

4006
01:47:26,100 --> 01:47:26,431
He,

4007
01:47:26,431 --> 01:47:27,090
uh,

4008
01:47:27,090 --> 01:47:28,020
he would.

4009
01:47:28,021 --> 01:47:29,730
Is this a Klitschko gets knocked out.

4010
01:47:30,730 --> 01:47:33,090
A Shannon breaks,

4011
01:47:33,091 --> 01:47:34,650
has these motivational
videos on instagram.

4012
01:47:34,651 --> 01:47:36,240
You got to follow his
instagram because he's,

4013
01:47:36,300 --> 01:47:37,080
he's always like,

4014
01:47:37,080 --> 01:47:38,010
let's go champ.

4015
01:47:38,100 --> 01:47:39,450
Let's go chill and talk and shit.

4016
01:47:39,451 --> 01:47:40,590
The Vladimir

4017
01:47:42,090 --> 01:47:42,511
Vladimir,

4018
01:47:42,511 --> 01:47:43,840
but talking positive shit like,

4019
01:47:44,040 --> 01:47:44,730
come out champ.

4020
01:47:44,730 --> 01:47:45,810
You've got to put away them sodas,

4021
01:47:45,811 --> 01:47:46,240
champ.

4022
01:47:46,240 --> 01:47:47,490
You've got to drink water champ.

4023
01:47:47,700 --> 01:47:49,770
You've got to be healthy
champion to get up early champ.

4024
01:47:49,830 --> 01:47:50,670
Can't be staying out late.

4025
01:47:50,770 --> 01:47:51,540
Partying champ.

4026
01:47:51,540 --> 01:47:52,231
And everything is like,

4027
01:47:52,231 --> 01:47:53,870
let's go champ champ.

4028
01:47:53,910 --> 01:47:54,061
Oh,

4029
01:47:54,061 --> 01:47:54,480
it's great.

4030
01:47:54,480 --> 01:47:55,313
It's hilarious.

4031
01:47:55,650 --> 01:47:56,940
But he's funny when he does it too,

4032
01:47:56,941 --> 01:47:58,530
like he's laughing and cracking jokes.

4033
01:47:58,531 --> 01:47:59,190
But uh,

4034
01:47:59,190 --> 01:48:01,220
we'll see the cat trying to
get the fight with Vladimir.

4035
01:48:01,230 --> 01:48:01,840
And he was like,

4036
01:48:01,840 --> 01:48:02,230
yeah,

4037
01:48:02,230 --> 01:48:04,770
he was on the boat where
you can chat and you eat.

4038
01:48:04,771 --> 01:48:06,060
I eat his food.

4039
01:48:06,061 --> 01:48:06,331
Yeah,

4040
01:48:06,331 --> 01:48:06,610
man.

4041
01:48:06,610 --> 01:48:07,860
Vladimir through some water on him.

4042
01:48:08,120 --> 01:48:09,270
Always trying to hype up a fight,

4043
01:48:09,271 --> 01:48:09,470
man.

4044
01:48:09,470 --> 01:48:10,890
It just never happened.

4045
01:48:11,100 --> 01:48:11,251
Well,

4046
01:48:11,251 --> 01:48:12,120
it might happen now.

4047
01:48:12,330 --> 01:48:13,230
It might happen now.

4048
01:48:13,410 --> 01:48:13,861
You think?

4049
01:48:13,861 --> 01:48:14,340
Yes,

4050
01:48:14,340 --> 01:48:15,170
it's very possible.

4051
01:48:15,170 --> 01:48:17,070
It'll happen now because a briggs,

4052
01:48:17,071 --> 01:48:17,904
just one.

4053
01:48:18,420 --> 01:48:19,410
He just knocked out,

4054
01:48:19,411 --> 01:48:19,710
uh,

4055
01:48:19,710 --> 01:48:21,630
his opponent I want to
say in the second round.

4056
01:48:21,631 --> 01:48:22,980
But you look real good dude.

4057
01:48:23,100 --> 01:48:23,790
I mean,

4058
01:48:23,790 --> 01:48:25,350
I don't know who the
dude was that he fought,

4059
01:48:25,351 --> 01:48:30,000
but he looks sharp and it was impressive
and he's got a big following on social

4060
01:48:30,001 --> 01:48:30,780
media.

4061
01:48:30,780 --> 01:48:34,670
Like a lot of like snoop dogg made this
video where he was smoking weed and a

4062
01:48:35,040 --> 01:48:35,850
snoop was like,

4063
01:48:35,850 --> 01:48:36,660
take a big puffs.

4064
01:48:36,660 --> 01:48:37,560
Let's go chance.

4065
01:48:37,650 --> 01:48:38,240
I'm flexible,

4066
01:48:38,240 --> 01:48:39,000
champ,

4067
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:39,630
champ.

4068
01:48:39,630 --> 01:48:41,040
I'm smoking this joyful you champ.

4069
01:48:41,150 --> 01:48:42,690
It's hilarious getting that support.

4070
01:48:42,840 --> 01:48:43,320
Well he's,

4071
01:48:43,320 --> 01:48:43,681
he's like,

4072
01:48:43,681 --> 01:48:44,700
it's super positive,

4073
01:48:44,701 --> 01:48:45,660
like all the stuff that he does,

4074
01:48:45,661 --> 01:48:46,530
it's very positive.

4075
01:48:46,950 --> 01:48:50,610
You see that snoop dogg video with the
little dicky ever heard of the Little

4076
01:48:50,610 --> 01:48:50,611
Dicky?

4077
01:48:50,611 --> 01:48:50,791
Yeah.

4078
01:48:50,791 --> 01:48:51,061
Yeah,

4079
01:48:51,061 --> 01:48:51,894
yeah.

4080
01:48:52,620 --> 01:48:53,453
No,

4081
01:48:53,530 --> 01:48:54,363
the white guy.

4082
01:48:54,690 --> 01:48:55,451
The Jewish rapper.

4083
01:48:55,451 --> 01:48:55,600
Yeah.

4084
01:48:55,600 --> 01:48:56,610
He's great at that song.

4085
01:48:56,611 --> 01:48:57,430
Saved that money.

4086
01:48:57,430 --> 01:48:58,050
Okay.

4087
01:48:58,050 --> 01:48:58,381
And then he,

4088
01:48:58,381 --> 01:48:59,070
he did a song.

4089
01:48:59,070 --> 01:49:00,780
He's got a bunch of songs.

4090
01:49:00,781 --> 01:49:01,180
He's Ah,

4091
01:49:01,180 --> 01:49:01,750
he's incredible.

4092
01:49:01,750 --> 01:49:03,510
He's been around forever,

4093
01:49:03,690 --> 01:49:06,810
but he did a song with snoop Dogg and
there's a cartoon that goes along with it

4094
01:49:07,080 --> 01:49:08,640
fucking incredible.

4095
01:49:08,790 --> 01:49:10,650
It's called professional rapper.

4096
01:49:10,920 --> 01:49:13,200
Holy fucking shit.

4097
01:49:13,201 --> 01:49:15,030
Him and snoop Dogg or
going back and forth.

4098
01:49:15,050 --> 01:49:15,450
Really?

4099
01:49:15,450 --> 01:49:15,770
Oh,

4100
01:49:15,770 --> 01:49:16,603
he's trying to get,

4101
01:49:16,690 --> 01:49:18,800
trying to get snoop Dogg
to sign them as soups all.

4102
01:49:18,810 --> 01:49:19,950
Why should I sign you and,

4103
01:49:20,040 --> 01:49:20,760
and dude,

4104
01:49:20,760 --> 01:49:21,593
it's,

4105
01:49:21,690 --> 01:49:24,150
it's one of the most
brilliant rap songs ever,

4106
01:49:24,160 --> 01:49:24,810
man.

4107
01:49:24,810 --> 01:49:25,830
Funny as shit.

4108
01:49:25,890 --> 01:49:27,200
That's high praise and Bravo.

4109
01:49:27,201 --> 01:49:27,530
Yeah,

4110
01:49:27,530 --> 01:49:28,410
I did it.

4111
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:29,820
I was completely floored.

4112
01:49:29,970 --> 01:49:30,900
Jamie Little Dicky.

4113
01:49:31,140 --> 01:49:32,670
Cut to the cut to the Kale here.

4114
01:49:32,671 --> 01:49:37,671
We're for the 15 minute videos to
guys and long pants and shitty kicks.

4115
01:49:39,270 --> 01:49:40,900
God Damn not looking at it,

4116
01:49:40,901 --> 01:49:44,090
but the dude who was
the heritage you've got.

4117
01:49:44,160 --> 01:49:45,210
We'll kicked in the mug.

4118
01:49:45,320 --> 01:49:47,160
So really to set up again.

4119
01:49:47,690 --> 01:49:48,523
See,

4120
01:49:49,100 --> 01:49:50,050
that was Klitschko.

4121
01:49:50,120 --> 01:49:50,501
Boom.

4122
01:49:50,501 --> 01:49:50,770
Yep.

4123
01:49:50,770 --> 01:49:51,521
That was vitaly.

4124
01:49:51,521 --> 01:49:51,761
He got.

4125
01:49:51,761 --> 01:49:54,070
We'll kicked in the head back it
up a little bit further than that,

4126
01:49:54,250 --> 01:49:58,330
that he started doing current
contact karate or kickboxing.

4127
01:49:58,780 --> 01:49:59,650
And this dude.

4128
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:00,330
No,

4129
01:50:00,330 --> 01:50:00,670
no,

4130
01:50:00,670 --> 01:50:01,121
no ring,

4131
01:50:01,121 --> 01:50:02,260
but it was above the waist.

4132
01:50:02,261 --> 01:50:04,960
Kickbox and with the dude starts
getting loose with his kicks.

4133
01:50:06,800 --> 01:50:07,511
That was nasty.

4134
01:50:07,511 --> 01:50:08,344
That was nice.

4135
01:50:09,550 --> 01:50:10,440
What ma'am?

4136
01:50:10,830 --> 01:50:11,050
I mean,

4137
01:50:11,050 --> 01:50:12,010
shit happens.

4138
01:50:12,700 --> 01:50:12,881
Yeah.

4139
01:50:12,881 --> 01:50:14,770
Well anybody who gets
hit by that is fucked.

4140
01:50:14,771 --> 01:50:16,210
I mean he's sitting his head up.

4141
01:50:16,300 --> 01:50:17,230
How long ago was that?

4142
01:50:17,500 --> 01:50:19,780
A long time ago by that video.

4143
01:50:19,781 --> 01:50:21,220
Fucking 1987.

4144
01:50:21,221 --> 01:50:22,060
It was a long time ago.

4145
01:50:22,280 --> 01:50:22,900
Goodyear?

4146
01:50:22,900 --> 01:50:26,110
I think vitaly is older than the
black on the bottom and shit,

4147
01:50:26,520 --> 01:50:30,910
but tallies like a couple of years older
and Vladimir is 39 so that could have

4148
01:50:30,911 --> 01:50:32,600
been from 90 to 90.

4149
01:50:32,680 --> 01:50:33,130
There you go.

4150
01:50:33,130 --> 01:50:33,963
That makes sense.

4151
01:50:35,050 --> 01:50:37,180
People are just figuring
out Moitai back then

4152
01:50:38,980 --> 01:50:39,813
they didn't know.

4153
01:50:39,940 --> 01:50:40,521
They didn't know that,

4154
01:50:40,521 --> 01:50:41,111
that no,

4155
01:50:41,111 --> 01:50:43,030
kicking to the legs is
just stupid as fuck.

4156
01:50:43,600 --> 01:50:45,370
I took a few guys going over to Thailand.

4157
01:50:45,660 --> 01:50:46,240
Took like a.

4158
01:50:46,240 --> 01:50:46,661
When Rick,

4159
01:50:46,661 --> 01:50:47,740
the Jack Rufus.

4160
01:50:48,100 --> 01:50:49,060
Who the fuck did he fight?

4161
01:50:49,320 --> 01:50:51,020
Fought some real high level Thai guy.

4162
01:50:51,430 --> 01:50:56,410
Had they got hurt real bad and he was
laying the ground level as record was not

4163
01:50:56,411 --> 01:50:57,120
impressive at all.

4164
01:50:57,120 --> 01:50:57,953
How the roof is fog.

4165
01:50:58,030 --> 01:50:58,271
Yeah.

4166
01:50:58,271 --> 01:51:00,430
He may have been famous
legend and all that,

4167
01:51:00,431 --> 01:51:01,660
but looking at his record,

4168
01:51:01,661 --> 01:51:03,850
he was like 13 and six or something like,

4169
01:51:03,880 --> 01:51:04,660
Oh really?

4170
01:51:04,660 --> 01:51:05,390
And Yeah.

4171
01:51:05,390 --> 01:51:05,701
Yeah,

4172
01:51:05,701 --> 01:51:07,240
that's crazy match.

4173
01:51:07,330 --> 01:51:10,090
It was one of the first fights we ever
got to see a guy who really knew how to

4174
01:51:10,091 --> 01:51:11,200
throw a leg kicks though.

4175
01:51:11,320 --> 01:51:12,130
Fucked his legs up.

4176
01:51:12,130 --> 01:51:13,180
They fucked his legs up,

4177
01:51:13,210 --> 01:51:14,000
but it was interesting.

4178
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:14,771
I liked kicks in.

4179
01:51:14,771 --> 01:51:19,090
They had to put him in a stretcher in a
stretcher because he couldn't walk and

4180
01:51:19,120 --> 01:51:22,330
Duke who's getting it gets
interviewed after the fight was like,

4181
01:51:22,331 --> 01:51:22,660
well,

4182
01:51:22,660 --> 01:51:24,280
not a lot of skill involved in that.

4183
01:51:25,560 --> 01:51:30,560
Didn't know any better because now he's
like one of the best Moitai for mma

4184
01:51:31,151 --> 01:51:32,440
coaches in the country.

4185
01:51:32,441 --> 01:51:33,161
It's hilarious.

4186
01:51:33,161 --> 01:51:36,040
He watched that when his
brother got his legs kicked.

4187
01:51:36,041 --> 01:51:36,280
Alec.

4188
01:51:36,280 --> 01:51:37,030
We didn't know that.

4189
01:51:37,030 --> 01:51:37,511
No one knew.

4190
01:51:37,511 --> 01:51:38,920
Then when I first,

4191
01:51:39,010 --> 01:51:40,330
when I first saw UFC too,

4192
01:51:40,720 --> 01:51:42,330
I was blown away by horse.

4193
01:51:42,340 --> 01:51:45,850
I was doing karate at the time and to
me I was thinking this is probably just

4194
01:51:45,851 --> 01:51:47,110
primitive as wrestling.

4195
01:51:47,510 --> 01:51:47,800
It looks,

4196
01:51:47,800 --> 01:51:49,780
it looks like a real
wrestler with fuck him up,

4197
01:51:51,250 --> 01:51:54,280
but then I went in and got
choked out 37 times and realized,

4198
01:51:54,340 --> 01:51:54,881
Oh shit,

4199
01:51:54,881 --> 01:51:56,140
it's not primitive wrestling.

4200
01:51:56,141 --> 01:51:57,670
It's highly advanced wrestling.

4201
01:51:57,880 --> 01:52:02,880
I had three big steps in like
from going from taekwondo,

4202
01:52:02,950 --> 01:52:03,783
like I,

4203
01:52:03,820 --> 01:52:08,820
I thought that taekwondo was like the
best way to fight stand up until I started

4204
01:52:09,131 --> 01:52:11,170
kickboxing and I started boxing,

4205
01:52:11,171 --> 01:52:14,650
just straight boxing with people to get
better kickboxing and then I realized

4206
01:52:14,651 --> 01:52:15,280
man,

4207
01:52:15,280 --> 01:52:19,570
like my boxing is so far behind these
guys and I thought my hands were so much

4208
01:52:19,571 --> 01:52:20,404
better than they were,

4209
01:52:20,680 --> 01:52:22,390
but at least I have kicks.

4210
01:52:22,391 --> 01:52:24,580
And then I started sparring with this kid,

4211
01:52:25,230 --> 01:52:28,450
this kid named Dana Rosenblatt and went
on to be like New England middle weight

4212
01:52:28,451 --> 01:52:29,284
boxing champion.

4213
01:52:29,410 --> 01:52:31,900
Very good box or slot on
Tuesday night fights a bunch.

4214
01:52:31,901 --> 01:52:32,100
Yeah.

4215
01:52:32,100 --> 01:52:33,570
You were boxing with them?

4216
01:52:33,760 --> 01:52:33,971
Yeah,

4217
01:52:33,971 --> 01:52:34,211
yeah.

4218
01:52:34,211 --> 01:52:35,680
We did some kickboxing to,

4219
01:52:35,681 --> 01:52:36,880
but we did a lot of only boxing,

4220
01:52:36,881 --> 01:52:39,520
but the point is he had a friend
that was fighting in Thailand.

4221
01:52:39,880 --> 01:52:40,960
He had this friend that was crazy.

4222
01:52:40,961 --> 01:52:42,430
It would go over to Thailand and fight,

4223
01:52:42,431 --> 01:52:43,930
fight the ties and he was just,

4224
01:52:43,990 --> 01:52:45,250
he was a real pioneer.

4225
01:52:45,290 --> 01:52:46,010
This dude is like one of

4226
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:49,850
the first Americans to start going over
their training in Thailand and fighting

4227
01:52:49,851 --> 01:52:50,100
tyler.

4228
01:52:50,100 --> 01:52:54,020
We hadn't really heard about it then and
so Dana and I were going over some of

4229
01:52:54,021 --> 01:52:55,280
the techniques that we're talking about,

4230
01:52:55,281 --> 01:52:58,400
some of it and we were talking about
like the elbows and the kicks and we were

4231
01:52:58,401 --> 01:53:03,260
practicing some of it and just him
hitting me half assed on the leg,

4232
01:53:03,261 --> 01:53:04,430
like not trying to hurt me,

4233
01:53:04,760 --> 01:53:08,720
just him throwing a leg kick and
feeling the Shin slamming on my leg.

4234
01:53:08,721 --> 01:53:09,291
Just like that.

4235
01:53:09,291 --> 01:53:09,980
Just thump.

4236
01:53:09,980 --> 01:53:10,730
I remember thinking,

4237
01:53:10,730 --> 01:53:11,660
oh no,

4238
01:53:11,910 --> 01:53:12,170
like,

4239
01:53:12,170 --> 01:53:12,621
oh no,

4240
01:53:12,621 --> 01:53:13,580
like this is all missing.

4241
01:53:13,581 --> 01:53:14,570
I didn't know about this.

4242
01:53:14,571 --> 01:53:15,860
Like how do I not know about this?

4243
01:53:16,120 --> 01:53:17,330
Like this is critical.

4244
01:53:17,720 --> 01:53:18,510
And then the,

4245
01:53:18,510 --> 01:53:20,660
the clenching and the knees to the body.

4246
01:53:20,661 --> 01:53:22,040
And then the elbows from the clinch.

4247
01:53:22,400 --> 01:53:22,671
I was like,

4248
01:53:22,671 --> 01:53:23,301
Jesus Christ,

4249
01:53:23,301 --> 01:53:25,910
like there's a giant hole
missing in all of the standup.

4250
01:53:26,780 --> 01:53:27,560
And then,

4251
01:53:27,560 --> 01:53:27,891
you know,

4252
01:53:27,891 --> 01:53:31,610
it never really took off
because of that PKA karate shit.

4253
01:53:31,820 --> 01:53:32,140
You know,

4254
01:53:32,140 --> 01:53:36,170
the PKA karate Kinda like
spoiled people to the idea of a,

4255
01:53:36,171 --> 01:53:37,010
of kickboxing.

4256
01:53:37,480 --> 01:53:38,120
I think that,

4257
01:53:38,120 --> 01:53:39,260
like Dana White said that,

4258
01:53:39,261 --> 01:53:39,921
I think he's right,

4259
01:53:39,921 --> 01:53:40,580
man.

4260
01:53:40,580 --> 01:53:43,520
I think like a lot of people in this
country that are like in our forties,

4261
01:53:43,740 --> 01:53:45,680
I mean we look back on that stuff on TV.

4262
01:53:45,681 --> 01:53:47,000
If you don't study martial arts,

4263
01:53:47,240 --> 01:53:49,150
you think of kickboxing is like bad.

4264
01:53:49,160 --> 01:53:49,993
Brad Half-ton,

4265
01:53:50,150 --> 01:53:53,110
like with the shiny red shorts throwing
like as many they have to show,

4266
01:53:53,120 --> 01:53:54,980
like throw like six kicks around.

4267
01:53:55,280 --> 01:53:56,300
Otherwise they lose points.

4268
01:53:56,301 --> 01:53:59,180
Remember that say would throw these
little flippy kicks and they would get in

4269
01:53:59,181 --> 01:54:00,440
there with some sloppy boxing.

4270
01:54:00,560 --> 01:54:03,560
So it was like flippy kicks and sloppy
boxing and nobody wanted to watch it.

4271
01:54:03,561 --> 01:54:04,430
It just wasn't that good.

4272
01:54:04,431 --> 01:54:05,300
It wasn't that evolved.

4273
01:54:05,620 --> 01:54:09,050
Tila Rick roofers came along and a few
guys came along that we were like real

4274
01:54:09,051 --> 01:54:09,884
dynamic,

4275
01:54:10,190 --> 01:54:11,780
but it's never really caught on,

4276
01:54:11,900 --> 01:54:12,860
was still has it,

4277
01:54:12,861 --> 01:54:13,071
right.

4278
01:54:13,071 --> 01:54:13,904
Like kickboxing here,

4279
01:54:13,940 --> 01:54:18,170
which I don't get like k one
like glory or even what did,

4280
01:54:18,171 --> 01:54:18,920
uh,

4281
01:54:18,920 --> 01:54:20,210
what did belt or put on,

4282
01:54:20,250 --> 01:54:22,880
what was that they put on
something called dynamite.

4283
01:54:22,881 --> 01:54:25,910
That was part kickboxing and part of MMA.

4284
01:54:25,911 --> 01:54:26,450
But here's,

4285
01:54:26,450 --> 01:54:27,380
here's what I think though,

4286
01:54:27,381 --> 01:54:27,681
man.

4287
01:54:27,681 --> 01:54:30,650
I think kickboxing dope
and I liked watching it,

4288
01:54:30,651 --> 01:54:31,101
but you know,

4289
01:54:31,101 --> 01:54:31,730
what's better?

4290
01:54:31,730 --> 01:54:33,470
Moitai more ties better,

4291
01:54:33,590 --> 01:54:33,950
you know,

4292
01:54:33,950 --> 01:54:34,361
because it's,

4293
01:54:34,361 --> 01:54:37,160
it's the full fucking arsenal of punching,

4294
01:54:37,190 --> 01:54:38,690
kicking elbows and knees.

4295
01:54:38,691 --> 01:54:39,524
And the clinch.

4296
01:54:39,870 --> 01:54:40,431
I watched,

4297
01:54:40,431 --> 01:54:40,700
uh,

4298
01:54:40,700 --> 01:54:41,870
the lion fight.

4299
01:54:41,900 --> 01:54:42,910
There was this past weekend.

4300
01:54:43,160 --> 01:54:44,630
I enjoyed they shit out of it,

4301
01:54:44,631 --> 01:54:44,900
dude.

4302
01:54:44,900 --> 01:54:46,740
The first dream killer Delano's.

4303
01:54:46,760 --> 01:54:47,990
Did you see that fucking spinning elbow?

4304
01:54:47,991 --> 01:54:49,540
He knocked that to that with no.

4305
01:54:49,550 --> 01:54:50,810
My God,

4306
01:54:50,920 --> 01:54:53,420
who was two spinning elbow Kaos like,

4307
01:54:53,450 --> 01:54:53,691
dude,

4308
01:54:53,691 --> 01:54:55,160
elbows are big man.

4309
01:54:55,160 --> 01:54:57,080
It's a weapon of boy ty.

4310
01:54:57,380 --> 01:54:59,420
I don't think there's any
reason to take that out.

4311
01:54:59,480 --> 01:55:01,130
I don't think there's any
reason to take elbows out.

4312
01:55:01,310 --> 01:55:06,310
I think if organizations like glory
and those guys want to just kick box,

4313
01:55:06,800 --> 01:55:09,470
let them just kickbox
but let do the elbow man.

4314
01:55:09,550 --> 01:55:10,540
Let them throw them away.

4315
01:55:11,690 --> 01:55:12,620
I don't think so.

4316
01:55:12,710 --> 01:55:14,120
I don't know what they're worried about.

4317
01:55:14,121 --> 01:55:15,080
But are those shows

4318
01:55:16,710 --> 01:55:17,420
successful?

4319
01:55:17,420 --> 01:55:18,253
I mean,

4320
01:55:18,450 --> 01:55:19,400
what's an access?

4321
01:55:19,401 --> 01:55:21,560
TV has a limited exposure.

4322
01:55:21,590 --> 01:55:23,720
There's not as many
households that have access.

4323
01:55:23,721 --> 01:55:26,210
TV used to be like it does well though,

4324
01:55:26,540 --> 01:55:27,560
Gloria doesn't do that well.

4325
01:55:27,561 --> 01:55:30,620
It doesn't do as well as it
probably could for whatever reason.

4326
01:55:30,680 --> 01:55:32,180
People don't know who
these fighters are yet.

4327
01:55:32,420 --> 01:55:32,751
They don't.

4328
01:55:32,751 --> 01:55:35,930
It's not like something that people have
been accustomed to get your site kit,

4329
01:55:35,990 --> 01:55:40,550
but watching the fucking
the boy tie on access TV.

4330
01:55:40,780 --> 01:55:41,030
Dude,

4331
01:55:41,030 --> 01:55:41,600
I love it.

4332
01:55:41,600 --> 01:55:42,260
Nasty.

4333
01:55:42,260 --> 01:55:42,990
And this Guy Joe,

4334
01:55:42,990 --> 01:55:43,590
not a want.

4335
01:55:43,590 --> 01:55:44,423
If you've seen him.

4336
01:55:44,460 --> 01:55:45,960
Twenty five year old Thai guy,

4337
01:55:46,620 --> 01:55:48,210
nasty fucking kicker,

4338
01:55:48,211 --> 01:55:48,750
dude.

4339
01:55:48,750 --> 01:55:50,730
One of the nastiest
kickers I've ever seen.

4340
01:55:50,910 --> 01:55:52,020
The dude just throws,

4341
01:55:52,230 --> 01:55:52,561
throws,

4342
01:55:52,561 --> 01:55:55,380
punches to close the distance
like his hands are up.

4343
01:55:55,381 --> 01:55:56,190
Way High,

4344
01:55:56,190 --> 01:55:57,960
brutal left kick left,

4345
01:55:57,961 --> 01:55:59,290
kick to the body lift kit.

4346
01:55:59,291 --> 01:56:00,780
This chopping this dude down.

4347
01:56:00,930 --> 01:56:03,000
And then once he gets close in on he,

4348
01:56:03,060 --> 01:56:06,090
he finishes them with actually two
elbows to the back of the head.

4349
01:56:06,740 --> 01:56:07,230
Fuck.

4350
01:56:07,230 --> 01:56:10,170
He blasted him with one elbow
and then as the guys going down,

4351
01:56:10,171 --> 01:56:12,390
he just fucking Tomahawks
the back of his neck.

4352
01:56:12,440 --> 01:56:12,690
I Wa,

4353
01:56:12,690 --> 01:56:12,950
I,

4354
01:56:12,950 --> 01:56:14,070
I record the,

4355
01:56:14,100 --> 01:56:14,821
those lion fights.

4356
01:56:14,821 --> 01:56:17,310
I watched the first one
when I was like two and one.

4357
01:56:17,311 --> 01:56:20,890
We're going to think it was pro
debut and they fucking went at it.

4358
01:56:20,970 --> 01:56:22,260
If you've got some Cli,

4359
01:56:22,340 --> 01:56:23,370
you see Yonson Clive.

4360
01:56:23,580 --> 01:56:24,030
No.

4361
01:56:24,030 --> 01:56:25,440
Holy Shit Dude.

4362
01:56:25,880 --> 01:56:30,300
There's the lion fight is getting these
guys from Thailand that are super high

4363
01:56:30,301 --> 01:56:34,950
level tie fighters and you're seeing
some wild wild fights because of how much

4364
01:56:34,951 --> 01:56:36,360
of those guys online flight makes.

4365
01:56:36,570 --> 01:56:36,940
No,

4366
01:56:36,940 --> 01:56:37,310
that's good.

4367
01:56:37,310 --> 01:56:38,250
Does anyone know?

4368
01:56:38,490 --> 01:56:40,070
Someone asked me last night and I said,

4369
01:56:40,080 --> 01:56:40,471
I don't know,

4370
01:56:40,471 --> 01:56:41,790
fucking $500.

4371
01:56:41,880 --> 01:56:42,780
I think the the,

4372
01:56:42,781 --> 01:56:43,220
the,

4373
01:56:43,220 --> 01:56:45,830
the guy who was making his
debut as like maybe a thousand.

4374
01:56:45,840 --> 01:56:49,040
I was trying to think back to my debut
in mma or maybe a thousand dollars.

4375
01:56:49,380 --> 01:56:50,310
I get paid $800.

4376
01:56:50,311 --> 01:56:52,980
I think it's the most under
appreciated thing going on right now.

4377
01:56:53,160 --> 01:56:53,850
Lion fight.

4378
01:56:53,850 --> 01:56:54,683
I really do.

4379
01:56:54,750 --> 01:56:57,240
Those fucking fights are super
high level entertainment.

4380
01:56:57,360 --> 01:56:58,140
Super exciting.

4381
01:56:58,140 --> 01:56:58,860
Super entertaining,

4382
01:56:58,860 --> 01:57:00,270
wild wild shit.

4383
01:57:00,300 --> 01:57:02,190
People getting dropped all my drawing.

4384
01:57:02,220 --> 01:57:05,820
They're getting knocked the fuck out to
just figuring out how to make kickboxing

4385
01:57:05,821 --> 01:57:06,654
entertainment.

4386
01:57:06,660 --> 01:57:06,901
Well,

4387
01:57:06,901 --> 01:57:07,920
it is more tie.

4388
01:57:07,950 --> 01:57:08,783
It's not just the.

4389
01:57:08,820 --> 01:57:10,110
I think there's a part.

4390
01:57:10,170 --> 01:57:13,140
The part of the problem
with kickboxing is you're,

4391
01:57:13,170 --> 01:57:14,220
you're able to do this,

4392
01:57:14,370 --> 01:57:15,091
you're able to do that.

4393
01:57:15,091 --> 01:57:20,091
Alistair overeem with gloves that come
up real high and you just wait in and

4394
01:57:20,131 --> 01:57:22,080
then they throw kicks and
punches to kind of trade.

4395
01:57:22,090 --> 01:57:22,923
Right?

4396
01:57:23,040 --> 01:57:25,740
Sometimes they do and it's
look at the highest levels.

4397
01:57:25,890 --> 01:57:28,830
Like when you're watching guys like
Nikki whole skin and his mother

4398
01:57:28,900 --> 01:57:29,640
motherfuckers.

4399
01:57:29,640 --> 01:57:31,200
I mean it's fun to watch at the,

4400
01:57:31,220 --> 01:57:32,010
at the highest level,

4401
01:57:32,010 --> 01:57:32,843
no doubt,

4402
01:57:32,910 --> 01:57:35,670
but I think you should
have the other elements.

4403
01:57:35,671 --> 01:57:37,140
I think if it's a standup fight,

4404
01:57:37,170 --> 01:57:37,680
those other.

4405
01:57:37,680 --> 01:57:39,510
If you can share a guy across the head.

4406
01:57:39,540 --> 01:57:39,781
Okay.

4407
01:57:39,781 --> 01:57:41,130
Can you share a guy across the head?

4408
01:57:41,250 --> 01:57:42,083
It's legal.

4409
01:57:42,180 --> 01:57:42,391
Okay.

4410
01:57:42,391 --> 01:57:43,230
There's no shin pads.

4411
01:57:43,260 --> 01:57:43,501
All right,

4412
01:57:43,501 --> 01:57:45,570
so why can't you elbow
anything triggered why?

4413
01:57:45,590 --> 01:57:47,150
Why nothing is more dangerous than.

4414
01:57:47,160 --> 01:57:47,700
Exactly.

4415
01:57:47,700 --> 01:57:48,660
So what are we doing here?

4416
01:57:48,690 --> 01:57:49,980
What you limiting weapons?

4417
01:57:50,100 --> 01:57:51,750
Why would you limit weapons and stand up?

4418
01:57:51,900 --> 01:57:53,400
If you limit weapons and stand up,

4419
01:57:53,430 --> 01:57:55,260
then you get an unrealistic sense of the,

4420
01:57:55,261 --> 01:57:57,270
the development of kickboxing technique,

4421
01:57:57,600 --> 01:58:01,830
the development of MMA as far as like
stand up striking you because like the

4422
01:58:01,831 --> 01:58:02,970
guys at the highest level,

4423
01:58:02,971 --> 01:58:07,590
if you see a guy like Kevin Bras are
like one of these like super high level

4424
01:58:07,591 --> 01:58:10,180
kickboxer guys and you see like that,

4425
01:58:10,630 --> 01:58:14,250
that becomes like a standard and then
that standard goes into like an 11 or a

4426
01:58:14,251 --> 01:58:15,084
Joe Schilling.

4427
01:58:15,170 --> 01:58:19,220
He see that high standard of style
of kickboxing and that becomes the.

4428
01:58:19,270 --> 01:58:22,350
The guys who were fighting
in mma aspire to that level.

4429
01:58:22,380 --> 01:58:22,770
True.

4430
01:58:22,770 --> 01:58:25,990
Like in the higher the level
is and kickboxing and the
higher the level is going

4431
01:58:25,991 --> 01:58:27,870
to be an mma as well I think.

4432
01:58:27,871 --> 01:58:30,780
But as soon as you limit
certain techniques that you say,

4433
01:58:30,781 --> 01:58:30,901
well,

4434
01:58:30,901 --> 01:58:32,310
they can't throw elbows
and they can't throw nice,

4435
01:58:32,311 --> 01:58:33,144
well then the,

4436
01:58:33,300 --> 01:58:38,280
then you're going to get a distorted
perception of it in mma because in mma you

4437
01:58:38,281 --> 01:58:39,120
can do those things.

4438
01:58:39,410 --> 01:58:42,160
So what's shut like what's the reason

4439
01:58:42,160 --> 01:58:42,570
for the.

4440
01:58:42,570 --> 01:58:43,260
They got everything.

4441
01:58:43,260 --> 01:58:44,100
This guy was right here.

4442
01:58:44,130 --> 01:58:46,120
They would say it's because,

4443
01:58:46,150 --> 01:58:46,271
hey,

4444
01:58:46,271 --> 01:58:46,960
one,

4445
01:58:46,960 --> 01:58:47,411
that's okay.

4446
01:58:47,411 --> 01:58:47,890
One did it.

4447
01:58:47,890 --> 01:58:48,721
That's what the Japanese did.

4448
01:58:48,721 --> 01:58:49,090
What did they.

4449
01:58:49,090 --> 01:58:49,741
What did they followed?

4450
01:58:49,741 --> 01:58:49,990
Suit.

4451
01:58:49,990 --> 01:58:50,710
What do they think?

4452
01:58:50,710 --> 01:58:51,130
I don't know.

4453
01:58:51,130 --> 01:58:52,000
They're doing it for a reason.

4454
01:58:52,360 --> 01:58:53,710
The Japanese do shit for a reason.

4455
01:58:53,800 --> 01:58:55,330
I think they think it's more exciting.

4456
01:58:55,390 --> 01:58:58,000
I think the by taking away the clinch,

4457
01:58:58,090 --> 01:58:59,440
you make guys fight more.

4458
01:58:59,520 --> 01:59:00,670
You know you may not make them.

4459
01:59:00,671 --> 01:59:03,110
They can't clench up as much
because if you watch Moitai,

4460
01:59:03,220 --> 01:59:04,550
a lot of it takes in the clench.

4461
01:59:04,980 --> 01:59:06,570
They throw nasty elbows to the,

4462
01:59:06,590 --> 01:59:07,271
to the body.

4463
01:59:07,271 --> 01:59:08,110
A lot of sweeps.

4464
01:59:08,380 --> 01:59:10,350
They trip each other because Barbara,

4465
01:59:10,390 --> 01:59:11,051
I don't mean to cut you off,

4466
01:59:11,051 --> 01:59:11,341
do anything.

4467
01:59:11,341 --> 01:59:14,710
It's gives the barbaric to like
with the elbows don't know,

4468
01:59:14,740 --> 01:59:16,690
especially with the American.

4469
01:59:16,780 --> 01:59:17,830
Why have it in MMA made?

4470
01:59:17,840 --> 01:59:18,640
Then why is it not?

4471
01:59:18,640 --> 01:59:21,340
My may can kick someone in the head.

4472
01:59:21,370 --> 01:59:22,270
Everything's an MMA.

4473
01:59:22,280 --> 01:59:27,070
The standup wise that's in
Moitai everything I'm thinking
on the ground while on

4474
01:59:27,071 --> 01:59:28,570
the sit on the ground.

4475
01:59:28,880 --> 01:59:30,550
There's that one dumb rule.

4476
01:59:30,600 --> 01:59:31,060
That's it.

4477
01:59:31,060 --> 01:59:32,230
That rule so dumb,

4478
01:59:32,380 --> 01:59:33,040
but that's it.

4479
01:59:33,040 --> 01:59:34,570
The 1:12 to six elbow rule.

4480
01:59:36,190 --> 01:59:37,240
The rule is ridiculous.

4481
01:59:37,241 --> 01:59:40,060
It doesn't make any sense if the rule,

4482
01:59:40,061 --> 01:59:40,871
if you don't know what it is,

4483
01:59:40,871 --> 01:59:45,310
you can't go down from like on the
clock from 12:00 to 6:00 with an elbow.

4484
01:59:45,311 --> 01:59:46,300
He gets too dangerous.

4485
01:59:46,330 --> 01:59:49,030
It's only because the people that were
in the athletic commission had seen a guy

4486
01:59:49,031 --> 01:59:49,930
break a brick with that.

4487
01:59:50,440 --> 01:59:50,951
I saw that.

4488
01:59:50,951 --> 01:59:51,160
No,

4489
01:59:51,160 --> 01:59:52,900
you can't hit someone in the head.

4490
01:59:53,170 --> 01:59:54,003
They could die.

4491
01:59:54,490 --> 01:59:54,700
No.

4492
01:59:54,700 --> 01:59:55,840
Twelve to six elbows.

4493
01:59:56,140 --> 01:59:57,820
So you can't even do it to a thigh.

4494
01:59:57,821 --> 01:59:58,630
Which is hilarious.

4495
01:59:58,630 --> 01:59:59,463
Did you see that homewood?

4496
01:59:59,480 --> 02:00:01,210
That boxer in Australia died.

4497
02:00:01,710 --> 02:00:02,543
Who?

4498
02:00:02,920 --> 02:00:03,271
Some,

4499
02:00:03,271 --> 02:00:05,020
a god,

4500
02:00:05,021 --> 02:00:07,030
he was a whatever.

4501
02:00:07,031 --> 02:00:08,590
He had like 30 something fights.

4502
02:00:08,980 --> 02:00:10,950
He died and he got knocked out.

4503
02:00:11,140 --> 02:00:11,973
Didn't wake up.

4504
02:00:11,980 --> 02:00:13,220
They took him to the hospital.

4505
02:00:13,270 --> 02:00:14,340
He died in the room.

4506
02:00:14,670 --> 02:00:15,340
Yeah.

4507
02:00:15,340 --> 02:00:17,290
It's like the one that happened
two or three times a year.

4508
02:00:17,360 --> 02:00:17,970
No,

4509
02:00:17,970 --> 02:00:18,781
I don't think so.

4510
02:00:18,781 --> 02:00:19,810
It happens every now and then.

4511
02:00:20,440 --> 02:00:21,430
This was the last one.

4512
02:00:21,460 --> 02:00:22,330
So in tweet it to me,

4513
02:00:22,390 --> 02:00:23,500
I thought they took the t two.

4514
02:00:23,501 --> 02:00:24,221
I thought you looked at it.

4515
02:00:24,221 --> 02:00:25,054
I might have.

4516
02:00:25,440 --> 02:00:26,273
Um,

4517
02:00:26,500 --> 02:00:27,310
it just happens,

4518
02:00:27,310 --> 02:00:27,700
you know,

4519
02:00:27,700 --> 02:00:27,971
it's,

4520
02:00:27,971 --> 02:00:29,020
it's a part of boxing,

4521
02:00:29,230 --> 02:00:30,760
so it's a scary part of boxing.

4522
02:00:31,960 --> 02:00:35,080
Bobby Ray's ex got this
documentary on Gerald McClellan.

4523
02:00:35,980 --> 02:00:37,720
He did a little dark on them.

4524
02:00:38,620 --> 02:00:39,520
That's a crazy story,

4525
02:00:39,521 --> 02:00:39,731
man.

4526
02:00:39,731 --> 02:00:40,450
Yeah.

4527
02:00:40,450 --> 02:00:42,280
I saw that fight live,

4528
02:00:42,360 --> 02:00:44,200
not live TV.

4529
02:00:44,590 --> 02:00:46,270
Nigel Benn and Gerald McClellan.

4530
02:00:46,970 --> 02:00:47,290
Asher,

4531
02:00:47,290 --> 02:00:47,810
that fight,

4532
02:00:47,810 --> 02:00:48,071
you know,

4533
02:00:48,071 --> 02:00:50,020
Gerald Mcclellan knows he was awesome.

4534
02:00:50,140 --> 02:00:50,440
Yeah.

4535
02:00:50,440 --> 02:00:54,370
At one point in time he was one of the
scariest boxers alive and he was a.

4536
02:00:54,460 --> 02:00:56,340
They were thinking that he
would be next in line fight.

4537
02:00:56,350 --> 02:00:57,183
Roy Jones,

4538
02:00:57,300 --> 02:00:58,390
they were looking at Roy Johnson.

4539
02:00:58,391 --> 02:01:00,340
Roy Jones was coming up and
after he'd beaten James,

4540
02:01:00,341 --> 02:01:05,341
Tony and Gerald Mcclellan was the
destroyer just smashing everybody.

4541
02:01:05,531 --> 02:01:07,210
But he used to cut a lot of weight.

4542
02:01:07,211 --> 02:01:07,810
Man,

4543
02:01:07,810 --> 02:01:11,230
he cut a lot of weight and
I'm back in those days.

4544
02:01:11,440 --> 02:01:14,920
I think you had a way in the day
of the fight I think you would.

4545
02:01:14,990 --> 02:01:16,750
And they didn't know anything about Ivs.

4546
02:01:16,751 --> 02:01:18,010
They didn't know anything about that shit.

4547
02:01:18,220 --> 02:01:19,060
And when you do that,

4548
02:01:19,061 --> 02:01:19,320
you,

4549
02:01:19,320 --> 02:01:19,950
you,

4550
02:01:19,950 --> 02:01:21,040
you your brain man,

4551
02:01:21,041 --> 02:01:22,150
you just do that.

4552
02:01:22,151 --> 02:01:22,251
No.

4553
02:01:22,251 --> 02:01:25,480
Wicki guy was on here and he was saying
that they think it might take more than

4554
02:01:25,481 --> 02:01:27,340
70 hours to 72 hours,

4555
02:01:27,341 --> 02:01:31,570
72 hours for your brain to completely
recover from being dehydrated like that.

4556
02:01:31,990 --> 02:01:36,970
And the crazy thing is most of the
deaths in boxing or in the lower weight

4557
02:01:36,971 --> 02:01:37,660
classes,

4558
02:01:37,660 --> 02:01:39,920
they're not in a heavyweight where
the guys punched the hardest.

4559
02:01:40,310 --> 02:01:43,310
It's in the lower weight classes and
they think it's because of dehydration.

4560
02:01:43,580 --> 02:01:46,850
They think that's a significant factor
and a lot of these guys dying and

4561
02:01:46,851 --> 02:01:47,684
hemorrhaging,

4562
02:01:47,720 --> 02:01:49,820
getting brain hemorrhages
in the ring and dying,

4563
02:01:49,821 --> 02:01:52,190
they think dehydration
is a significant factor.

4564
02:01:52,191 --> 02:01:53,180
So homeboy died.

4565
02:01:53,840 --> 02:01:55,130
Well Gerald Mcclellan didn't die,

4566
02:01:55,430 --> 02:01:55,770
but he,

4567
02:01:55,770 --> 02:01:56,170
he,

4568
02:01:56,170 --> 02:01:56,440
he.

4569
02:01:56,440 --> 02:01:57,620
But he was a superstar.

4570
02:01:57,800 --> 02:01:58,640
He was a superstar.

4571
02:01:58,641 --> 02:01:59,510
He was a world champion.

4572
02:01:59,511 --> 02:02:00,850
He was on the rise and he,

4573
02:02:00,860 --> 02:02:03,800
he hurt Nigel Benn bad knock
them through the ropes.

4574
02:02:04,250 --> 02:02:06,140
But Nigel Benn was a bad motherfucker.

4575
02:02:06,430 --> 02:02:08,600
Been thought with an Afro Sheen.

4576
02:02:08,660 --> 02:02:09,010
Yeah.

4577
02:02:09,010 --> 02:02:10,040
Well you had dreadlocks.

4578
02:02:10,041 --> 02:02:14,030
He crazy dreadlocks and Nigel bank got
back in that ring and it was fucking

4579
02:02:14,031 --> 02:02:14,864
slinging.

4580
02:02:14,990 --> 02:02:15,621
And they,

4581
02:02:15,621 --> 02:02:15,921
uh,

4582
02:02:15,921 --> 02:02:19,550
they clashed heads and Gerald
Mcclellan went down and um,

4583
02:02:19,970 --> 02:02:23,060
I think that was when he went to his
corner and he just stopped the fight.

4584
02:02:23,330 --> 02:02:24,830
I think it was right after a head clash.

4585
02:02:25,040 --> 02:02:25,780
But I think he had,

4586
02:02:25,780 --> 02:02:27,410
he had been hit a couple times.

4587
02:02:27,650 --> 02:02:28,940
Nigel Bennett tagged him.

4588
02:02:28,970 --> 02:02:29,421
I mean they were,

4589
02:02:29,421 --> 02:02:33,920
they were teen off in each other and then
there was a big collision of heads and

4590
02:02:34,250 --> 02:02:35,180
Gerald took a knee,

4591
02:02:35,181 --> 02:02:37,310
I think and stay down
for the count of Eight.

4592
02:02:37,670 --> 02:02:39,230
And then I think never got up.

4593
02:02:39,231 --> 02:02:41,030
I think sat on a stool and then collapsed.

4594
02:02:41,540 --> 02:02:42,710
Pretty sure that's how it went.

4595
02:02:43,070 --> 02:02:43,903
He didn't die,

4596
02:02:44,010 --> 02:02:46,000
but why the fuck would
they make a documentary?

4597
02:02:46,080 --> 02:02:46,820
Because he's,

4598
02:02:46,820 --> 02:02:49,340
he's almost blind from that.

4599
02:02:50,050 --> 02:02:50,720
He's dying.

4600
02:02:50,720 --> 02:02:51,770
He can't talk.

4601
02:02:51,950 --> 02:02:52,783
He barely,

4602
02:02:53,330 --> 02:02:56,300
barely remembers anything
about his career.

4603
02:02:56,910 --> 02:02:59,300
He's been taken care of by sisters.

4604
02:02:59,480 --> 02:03:04,390
His body's completely atrophied
and it's really sad to see you man.

4605
02:03:04,510 --> 02:03:06,380
And if you go back before that fight,

4606
02:03:06,590 --> 02:03:07,970
he was the motherfucker,

4607
02:03:08,180 --> 02:03:08,451
you know,

4608
02:03:08,451 --> 02:03:11,810
he was like one of those guys like
Gennady Golovkin or something like that.

4609
02:03:13,190 --> 02:03:14,180
They'll financially.

4610
02:03:14,300 --> 02:03:14,691
No,

4611
02:03:14,691 --> 02:03:15,231
I don't think so,

4612
02:03:15,231 --> 02:03:15,511
man.

4613
02:03:15,511 --> 02:03:17,350
I know I'm obviously a joke joke.

4614
02:03:17,360 --> 02:03:18,193
How dare you?

4615
02:03:18,820 --> 02:03:19,653
That's a bummer.

4616
02:03:19,880 --> 02:03:22,160
I think Roy Jones done some stuff to help,

4617
02:03:22,161 --> 02:03:22,361
but uh,

4618
02:03:22,361 --> 02:03:23,031
apparently,

4619
02:03:23,031 --> 02:03:23,211
uh,

4620
02:03:23,211 --> 02:03:27,140
a lot of people think that that was what
had fucked Roy Jones up earlier in his

4621
02:03:27,141 --> 02:03:28,400
career and made them place safe.

4622
02:03:28,850 --> 02:03:32,750
Here's a hall is about to
fight gay garden was shit.

4623
02:03:32,960 --> 02:03:33,241
Eddie,

4624
02:03:33,241 --> 02:03:34,074
you got your IRA?

4625
02:03:34,160 --> 02:03:34,580
No,

4626
02:03:34,580 --> 02:03:34,781
no,

4627
02:03:34,781 --> 02:03:34,911
no.

4628
02:03:34,911 --> 02:03:35,744
I got massage,

4629
02:03:36,070 --> 02:03:37,210
but was saucy.

4630
02:03:37,220 --> 02:03:39,570
Very confident that I know yet.

4631
02:03:40,650 --> 02:03:41,020
Sauces.

4632
02:03:41,020 --> 02:03:42,110
Pressuring him real early,

4633
02:03:42,111 --> 02:03:42,470
man.

4634
02:03:42,470 --> 02:03:43,340
Not Scared.

4635
02:03:43,490 --> 02:03:44,810
She's so he gets them down early.

4636
02:03:44,811 --> 02:03:45,261
Oh yeah.

4637
02:03:45,261 --> 02:03:46,094
This one is not gonna last.

4638
02:03:46,710 --> 02:03:47,720
It's hard to keep them.

4639
02:03:48,350 --> 02:03:48,741
Oh Man.

4640
02:03:48,741 --> 02:03:50,900
It hurt them to tag them with
a right hand in the ground.

4641
02:03:50,901 --> 02:03:53,300
And pound was saucy all over Uriah Hall.

4642
02:03:53,790 --> 02:03:54,790
Mother Fucker,

4643
02:03:54,800 --> 02:03:55,190
man.

4644
02:03:55,190 --> 02:03:56,090
What are the arm bars?

4645
02:03:56,360 --> 02:03:56,541
Oh,

4646
02:03:56,541 --> 02:03:57,021
Jesus.

4647
02:03:57,021 --> 02:03:57,680
Big left hand.

4648
02:03:57,680 --> 02:03:59,620
Jesus Christ with sauces all over him.

4649
02:04:01,090 --> 02:04:02,330
Super aggressive sauces.

4650
02:04:02,331 --> 02:04:03,360
Got some nasty ground pound.

4651
02:04:03,380 --> 02:04:03,861
I don't know how good.

4652
02:04:03,861 --> 02:04:06,220
Uriah Hall's guard is a good guard.

4653
02:04:06,780 --> 02:04:07,640
You got to have a good garden.

4654
02:04:07,641 --> 02:04:09,260
Whose House has got
high level ground game,

4655
02:04:09,261 --> 02:04:10,020
man.

4656
02:04:10,020 --> 02:04:10,430
You're A.

4657
02:04:10,430 --> 02:04:10,710
Yeah.

4658
02:04:10,710 --> 02:04:12,560
If there's a knock on your
eyes to the ground game,

4659
02:04:13,910 --> 02:04:14,720
oh shit.

4660
02:04:14,720 --> 02:04:15,860
Can't teed off on.

4661
02:04:17,840 --> 02:04:18,673
These are dangerous.

4662
02:04:18,800 --> 02:04:19,700
Exactly how.

4663
02:04:19,760 --> 02:04:20,421
How you fight your.

4664
02:04:20,421 --> 02:04:21,254
I have though,

4665
02:04:21,320 --> 02:04:22,153
a lot of pressure.

4666
02:04:22,730 --> 02:04:25,260
Don't let them sit back
and guard a lot detail.

4667
02:04:26,200 --> 02:04:27,033
No,

4668
02:04:27,230 --> 02:04:28,610
not from what I saw.

4669
02:04:29,630 --> 02:04:32,240
Who's his main trainer right now is
it's the guy who was trained in jail,

4670
02:04:32,241 --> 02:04:32,630
right?

4671
02:04:32,630 --> 02:04:32,901
Yeah.

4672
02:04:32,901 --> 02:04:33,734
That black guy.

4673
02:04:33,860 --> 02:04:34,693
What is his name?

4674
02:04:34,910 --> 02:04:35,670
I forget.

4675
02:04:35,670 --> 02:04:36,140
Racist.

4676
02:04:36,140 --> 02:04:36,960
Look at that.

4677
02:04:36,960 --> 02:04:37,793
We just said

4678
02:04:38,300 --> 02:04:41,250
it's about the crucifix
and go to work with elbows.

4679
02:04:41,260 --> 02:04:43,620
Ever going to stop it too much for him.

4680
02:04:43,680 --> 02:04:44,513
Oh man,

4681
02:04:44,750 --> 02:04:45,583
you're right.

4682
02:04:45,750 --> 02:04:46,070
You're right.

4683
02:04:46,070 --> 02:04:47,090
You gotta

4684
02:04:48,840 --> 02:04:49,441
gotTa frame up.

4685
02:04:49,441 --> 02:04:51,180
But I left home and I said,

4686
02:04:51,181 --> 02:04:52,014
why don't you fly out?

4687
02:04:54,750 --> 02:04:55,800
It keeps it fresh.

4688
02:04:55,920 --> 02:04:56,430
Look at that.

4689
02:04:56,430 --> 02:04:57,310
Look at that crash.

4690
02:04:58,570 --> 02:04:59,820
Such a smart fighter man.

4691
02:04:59,821 --> 02:05:01,560
You look at the guys he's beat jock.

4692
02:05:01,561 --> 02:05:02,040
Re.

4693
02:05:02,040 --> 02:05:02,401
Hector,

4694
02:05:02,401 --> 02:05:02,911
lumbar.

4695
02:05:02,911 --> 02:05:04,890
I mean Henderson such a list.

4696
02:05:05,310 --> 02:05:06,590
That big house to the elbow.

4697
02:05:06,820 --> 02:05:08,100
Oh Jesus Christ.

4698
02:05:08,310 --> 02:05:09,091
His ground and pounds.

4699
02:05:09,091 --> 02:05:11,050
Fucking ferocious and it's intelligent to.

4700
02:05:11,400 --> 02:05:12,460
He does a real good job.

4701
02:05:14,820 --> 02:05:15,653
That was a big elbow.

4702
02:05:15,720 --> 02:05:18,930
The amount of shots that he gets
in versus attempted is very high.

4703
02:05:18,960 --> 02:05:19,830
He's going to break you.

4704
02:05:20,030 --> 02:05:22,440
He knows when he can tee off
on you and when he can't.

4705
02:05:22,740 --> 02:05:26,280
If you look at is percentage of landing
ground and pound strikes is pretty high.

4706
02:05:26,420 --> 02:05:31,420
They're the arm shouldn't as you ride
hall know to hold onto that garden

4707
02:05:33,480 --> 02:05:34,110
and he's had.

4708
02:05:34,110 --> 02:05:34,830
He's fine.

4709
02:05:34,830 --> 02:05:35,041
Yeah,

4710
02:05:35,041 --> 02:05:35,790
he's fine.

4711
02:05:35,790 --> 02:05:36,241
He's fine.

4712
02:05:36,241 --> 02:05:37,090
Right or left hand.

4713
02:05:37,290 --> 02:05:38,520
But you know what back?

4714
02:05:38,530 --> 02:05:39,030
No.

4715
02:05:39,030 --> 02:05:39,863
Get this crucifix.

4716
02:05:40,270 --> 02:05:41,010
Crucifix.

4717
02:05:41,010 --> 02:05:42,520
I man left leg trapped.

4718
02:05:42,650 --> 02:05:43,483
Look this,

4719
02:05:43,620 --> 02:05:45,480
you can still explode a little.

4720
02:05:45,500 --> 02:05:46,770
You could explode a little,

4721
02:05:46,950 --> 02:05:48,750
but he doesn't have the
confidence to try to get up.

4722
02:05:48,751 --> 02:05:50,070
Now he's going to be worn out.

4723
02:05:50,280 --> 02:05:51,190
He's got this case.

4724
02:05:51,200 --> 02:05:52,950
It's got half guard
and double under hooks,

4725
02:05:53,460 --> 02:05:53,701
right?

4726
02:05:53,701 --> 02:05:56,480
This just doesn't have
that to get up and reverse.

4727
02:05:56,930 --> 02:05:57,763
Have Garden.

4728
02:05:57,920 --> 02:05:59,310
It is the other side.

4729
02:06:00,540 --> 02:06:01,490
Hang onto that headset.

4730
02:06:01,590 --> 02:06:02,423
Isn't that Funny Eddie?

4731
02:06:02,880 --> 02:06:05,280
Like he would have to have his head on
the right hand side for it to be more

4732
02:06:05,281 --> 02:06:07,440
effective on his right hand.

4733
02:06:07,441 --> 02:06:09,360
So he has geico.

4734
02:06:10,500 --> 02:06:10,921
Tell you what,

4735
02:06:10,921 --> 02:06:13,210
that's a long flight
back home to the US from

4736
02:06:15,110 --> 02:06:16,890
looking nice and attacks with a leg.

4737
02:06:16,920 --> 02:06:20,400
That was a very nice mountain scape
and this is some good swamp walking by.

4738
02:06:20,970 --> 02:06:22,700
I know you're at home in his Jujitsu,

4739
02:06:22,750 --> 02:06:23,101
Jason.

4740
02:06:23,101 --> 02:06:23,491
Mainly.

4741
02:06:23,491 --> 02:06:25,950
Who's a fucking monster legged monster.

4742
02:06:26,880 --> 02:06:27,271
Really?

4743
02:06:27,271 --> 02:06:27,421
Well,

4744
02:06:27,421 --> 02:06:28,560
that's not bad right there.

4745
02:06:28,720 --> 02:06:29,940
At least not good.

4746
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,220
Attempting to get out of that position.

4747
02:06:32,460 --> 02:06:32,701
Yeah,

4748
02:06:32,701 --> 02:06:33,810
at least he got out of the mouth

4749
02:06:35,330 --> 02:06:38,130
and there's hope now was
trying to go for the leg again.

4750
02:06:38,760 --> 02:06:39,370
He's just way,

4751
02:06:39,370 --> 02:06:41,580
way Manley's shallow though.

4752
02:06:42,060 --> 02:06:43,240
He has to let go,

4753
02:06:43,840 --> 02:06:46,180
but it's going to give up his
back and going for it and he's.

4754
02:06:46,230 --> 02:06:48,690
He's gone back to it back
in his guard again though.

4755
02:06:48,691 --> 02:06:49,180
We'll kick hard.

4756
02:06:49,180 --> 02:06:49,770
Smart.

4757
02:06:49,770 --> 02:06:50,310
He just did.

4758
02:06:50,310 --> 02:06:51,570
He didn't play the game right there.

4759
02:06:51,571 --> 02:06:52,270
He just said,

4760
02:06:52,270 --> 02:06:55,400
I just went up and you've already got
your smart and he knows how to pass.

4761
02:06:55,950 --> 02:06:56,250
Okay.

4762
02:06:56,250 --> 02:06:57,420
To mention a good.

4763
02:06:57,480 --> 02:06:59,860
That's not a good defense of
the past either by your ride.

4764
02:07:01,620 --> 02:07:02,490
He doesn't have it.

4765
02:07:06,840 --> 02:07:08,010
Turns it around.

4766
02:07:08,011 --> 02:07:08,651
Oh my goodness.

4767
02:07:08,651 --> 02:07:09,484
Holy Shit.

4768
02:07:09,870 --> 02:07:11,700
That was Jason Manly Shit,

4769
02:07:11,701 --> 02:07:11,941
man.

4770
02:07:11,941 --> 02:07:12,571
I'm telling you this,

4771
02:07:12,571 --> 02:07:17,130
Jason man must know because the way he
did it from having no fucking control the

4772
02:07:17,131 --> 02:07:17,710
legs at all,

4773
02:07:17,710 --> 02:07:19,290
that's what Jason teaches.

4774
02:07:19,620 --> 02:07:21,720
But isn't that like a classic defence?

4775
02:07:22,140 --> 02:07:23,640
Jason Manley's really good at rolling.

4776
02:07:24,180 --> 02:07:25,013
So

4777
02:07:26,120 --> 02:07:27,000
to cameras,

4778
02:07:27,390 --> 02:07:28,260
that's the classic,

4779
02:07:28,261 --> 02:07:28,550
right?

4780
02:07:28,550 --> 02:07:31,950
The overcommitment for the Camorra and
then there's a spinning pharcyde arm bar

4781
02:07:31,980 --> 02:07:32,813
counter.

4782
02:07:33,010 --> 02:07:34,480
That's so good at St Pierre.

4783
02:07:34,481 --> 02:07:34,660
Matt.

4784
02:07:34,660 --> 02:07:35,440
He right?

4785
02:07:35,440 --> 02:07:35,860
Yeah.

4786
02:07:35,860 --> 02:07:36,130
Yeah,

4787
02:07:36,130 --> 02:07:36,470
but he,

4788
02:07:36,470 --> 02:07:37,303
he,

4789
02:07:37,870 --> 02:07:38,160
he,

4790
02:07:38,160 --> 02:07:39,270
he initiated the Camorra.

4791
02:07:39,460 --> 02:07:40,293
Uriah Hall.

4792
02:07:41,770 --> 02:07:43,420
Thought about spinning it on him,

4793
02:07:43,740 --> 02:07:45,010
but he spun back on

4794
02:07:46,750 --> 02:07:50,160
this back control 45 seconds to go.

4795
02:07:50,170 --> 02:07:51,640
Not good for you.

4796
02:07:51,700 --> 02:07:52,960
This is the thing on this position,

4797
02:07:53,040 --> 02:07:56,730
if you want to take away his
explosiveness is doing it.

4798
02:07:56,830 --> 02:07:57,221
It is.

4799
02:07:57,221 --> 02:08:00,090
Let's see how good his defenses from here
because gate guard doesn't have there.

4800
02:08:00,130 --> 02:08:00,970
It goes by the triangle.

4801
02:08:00,971 --> 02:08:03,430
Now wear him out with that for awhile.

4802
02:08:03,570 --> 02:08:03,850
You know,

4803
02:08:03,850 --> 02:08:04,960
he's got to get them down again.

4804
02:08:04,961 --> 02:08:06,090
I mean this is going to be over.

4805
02:08:06,130 --> 02:08:06,963
He's going to survive.

4806
02:08:07,150 --> 02:08:07,510
Kenny,

4807
02:08:07,510 --> 02:08:08,740
take him down again.

4808
02:08:09,280 --> 02:08:10,360
He took them down pretty easily.

4809
02:08:12,440 --> 02:08:13,540
He's got it.

4810
02:08:13,541 --> 02:08:14,550
He's got it locked in there.

4811
02:08:14,570 --> 02:08:15,710
He's got a lot of

4812
02:08:18,630 --> 02:08:19,463
the other

4813
02:08:21,100 --> 02:08:23,490
second load of the sleep thing.

4814
02:08:23,800 --> 02:08:25,440
I don't want them to tap me neither.

4815
02:08:25,450 --> 02:08:26,283
I want the skin.

4816
02:08:26,430 --> 02:08:27,790
Once he got it,

4817
02:08:27,820 --> 02:08:28,561
he got to ride.

4818
02:08:28,561 --> 02:08:29,141
Let him break it.

4819
02:08:29,141 --> 02:08:29,560
Go.

4820
02:08:29,560 --> 02:08:30,360
Ooh.

4821
02:08:30,360 --> 02:08:31,193
Oh,

4822
02:08:32,110 --> 02:08:32,600
how?

4823
02:08:32,600 --> 02:08:34,740
How great is a fight when
you want to see the you.

4824
02:08:34,930 --> 02:08:35,140
No,

4825
02:08:35,140 --> 02:08:35,350
no,

4826
02:08:35,350 --> 02:08:36,183
no.

4827
02:08:36,300 --> 02:08:37,133
Come on.

4828
02:08:37,630 --> 02:08:38,041
But that was.

4829
02:08:38,041 --> 02:08:40,390
It came out like a motherfucker slick.

4830
02:08:40,391 --> 02:08:41,500
Written naked man.

4831
02:08:41,620 --> 02:08:42,490
Very slick.

4832
02:08:43,360 --> 02:08:43,790
Look,

4833
02:08:43,790 --> 02:08:44,410
I could.

4834
02:08:44,410 --> 02:08:44,591
You know.

4835
02:08:44,591 --> 02:08:44,681
What?

4836
02:08:44,681 --> 02:08:48,640
Is it funny that they have this commercial
was fucking monster from the swamp.

4837
02:08:49,300 --> 02:08:51,550
The cracking or something
kills these dudes.

4838
02:08:51,940 --> 02:08:53,860
How much different is
that than an alligator?

4839
02:08:53,980 --> 02:08:55,590
They see those bitches all the time.

4840
02:08:55,600 --> 02:08:56,141
Alligator.

4841
02:08:56,141 --> 02:08:57,310
Stupid as fuck.

4842
02:08:57,730 --> 02:08:59,420
They see that scary when they're smart.

4843
02:08:59,710 --> 02:09:01,050
Nothing scarier than octopuses.

4844
02:09:01,060 --> 02:09:01,550
That's true.

4845
02:09:01,550 --> 02:09:02,920
A B movie right there.

4846
02:09:05,060 --> 02:09:10,060
No street octopus movie that comes out
of the water that can come out at night.

4847
02:09:10,241 --> 02:09:11,590
They could stay on for 30 minutes.

4848
02:09:11,591 --> 02:09:12,424
I saw some.

4849
02:09:13,060 --> 02:09:15,160
I saw some gnarliest
crocodiles in Costa Rica.

4850
02:09:15,161 --> 02:09:15,994
Man,

4851
02:09:16,180 --> 02:09:16,780
raining.

4852
02:09:16,780 --> 02:09:17,231
Oh Shit.

4853
02:09:17,231 --> 02:09:17,801
At the training.

4854
02:09:17,801 --> 02:09:21,240
That giant killer octopus could fucking
track you down up the mountains.

4855
02:09:21,520 --> 02:09:23,880
Can Hide in trees and shit with you.

4856
02:09:23,890 --> 02:09:24,520
About that,

4857
02:09:24,520 --> 02:09:27,550
do you ever see the octopus that climbs
out of the fish tank and goes across the

4858
02:09:27,551 --> 02:09:28,031
floor?

4859
02:09:28,031 --> 02:09:30,720
It happens on a million videos on youtube.

4860
02:09:31,190 --> 02:09:32,023
Do you do?

4861
02:09:33,070 --> 02:09:35,590
It's incredible how many
octopus videos they're on.

4862
02:09:35,600 --> 02:09:36,360
You too,

4863
02:09:36,360 --> 02:09:37,500
baby brown too.

4864
02:09:37,510 --> 02:09:38,680
So here's the question.

4865
02:09:39,250 --> 02:09:42,340
I'm the first round clear to gay guard,

4866
02:09:42,341 --> 02:09:42,670
right?

4867
02:09:42,670 --> 02:09:43,540
Total control.

4868
02:09:43,930 --> 02:09:45,670
But uriah,

4869
02:09:45,700 --> 02:09:45,911
I mean,

4870
02:09:45,911 --> 02:09:46,840
can you take him down again?

4871
02:09:47,370 --> 02:09:48,203
Take them down.

4872
02:09:49,160 --> 02:09:50,200
He's going to be hesitant.

4873
02:09:50,230 --> 02:09:51,590
You know Chael Sonnen took Anderson.

4874
02:09:57,950 --> 02:09:59,190
Oh shit son.

4875
02:09:59,220 --> 02:09:59,461
Those.

4876
02:09:59,461 --> 02:10:00,060
Stop it.

4877
02:10:00,060 --> 02:10:00,950
Don't stop it yet.

4878
02:10:00,960 --> 02:10:01,061
No,

4879
02:10:01,061 --> 02:10:01,241
no,

4880
02:10:01,241 --> 02:10:01,580
no.

4881
02:10:01,580 --> 02:10:04,260
It started with a guard.

4882
02:10:05,610 --> 02:10:06,540
He's getting smashed.

4883
02:10:07,280 --> 02:10:08,113
Stop it now.

4884
02:10:08,350 --> 02:10:09,280
You got to stop it.

4885
02:10:09,560 --> 02:10:10,420
Oh my

4886
02:10:12,070 --> 02:10:12,903
God.

4887
02:10:14,100 --> 02:10:14,730
See,

4888
02:10:14,730 --> 02:10:15,990
this is what I was saying before,

4889
02:10:15,991 --> 02:10:19,980
the fight that this guy has moments where
his hand got you in that discussion.

4890
02:10:21,250 --> 02:10:22,620
So extraordinary.

4891
02:10:23,070 --> 02:10:25,590
You were saying like the
best things you were.

4892
02:10:25,620 --> 02:10:27,120
You were saying all the right things,

4893
02:10:27,121 --> 02:10:30,300
but meanwhile you right in the
first round and the first round,

4894
02:10:30,301 --> 02:10:31,560
you were perfectly right.

4895
02:10:31,770 --> 02:10:33,000
He really did what you,

4896
02:10:33,350 --> 02:10:34,100
you would do in the

4897
02:10:34,100 --> 02:10:34,933
first round.

4898
02:10:36,470 --> 02:10:38,960
Anderson's jail son and
took Anderson Silva down.

4899
02:10:39,050 --> 02:10:41,000
The first reading was all
over him and I thought,

4900
02:10:41,001 --> 02:10:41,150
man,

4901
02:10:41,150 --> 02:10:41,390
he's not.

4902
02:10:41,390 --> 02:10:42,620
Can he do that for five rounds?

4903
02:10:43,040 --> 02:10:43,161
Well,

4904
02:10:43,161 --> 02:10:43,970
here's,

4905
02:10:43,970 --> 02:10:44,571
here's the thing.

4906
02:10:44,571 --> 02:10:44,841
I mean,

4907
02:10:44,841 --> 02:10:48,820
could you Ryan Hall have the explosiveness
left in that second round of getting

4908
02:10:48,830 --> 02:10:50,360
mauled in the first to look at this.

4909
02:10:52,910 --> 02:10:54,480
Kicked to the fucking mom.

4910
02:10:56,250 --> 02:10:57,083
Come on,

4911
02:10:58,580 --> 02:10:59,030
man.

4912
02:10:59,030 --> 02:10:59,810
What I'm saying about,

4913
02:10:59,810 --> 02:11:01,220
look at that movement with.

4914
02:11:01,830 --> 02:11:02,990
They're probably going
to show one more time,

4915
02:11:02,991 --> 02:11:05,690
but look how there's no
fat in that movement.

4916
02:11:05,900 --> 02:11:07,010
The way he throws this.

4917
02:11:07,011 --> 02:11:07,880
Watch this look,

4918
02:11:08,550 --> 02:11:09,080
dude,

4919
02:11:09,080 --> 02:11:10,340
you don't see that comment.

4920
02:11:10,341 --> 02:11:11,174
There's no,

4921
02:11:11,220 --> 02:11:12,760
no give can't train for them.

4922
02:11:12,780 --> 02:11:13,310
No.

4923
02:11:13,310 --> 02:11:13,910
Well you can.

4924
02:11:13,910 --> 02:11:17,580
You can train to never
be close doing signings.

4925
02:11:17,620 --> 02:11:20,240
Tough shit is so good,

4926
02:11:20,270 --> 02:11:21,090
dude.

4927
02:11:21,090 --> 02:11:22,040
That'll be a highlight.

4928
02:11:22,041 --> 02:11:22,874
Both of those

4929
02:11:25,100 --> 02:11:26,810
are legit stoppage,

4930
02:11:26,811 --> 02:11:27,021
man.

4931
02:11:27,021 --> 02:11:28,250
This is a legit stoppage.

4932
02:11:28,430 --> 02:11:28,730
You know?

4933
02:11:28,730 --> 02:11:29,000
I mean,

4934
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:33,430
I know Musashi would
probably say it's not fair.

4935
02:11:34,080 --> 02:11:34,521
You got to.

4936
02:11:34,521 --> 02:11:38,270
You got to give it to a man by a holy

4937
02:11:39,950 --> 02:11:40,620
shit.

4938
02:11:40,620 --> 02:11:41,240
See,

4939
02:11:41,240 --> 02:11:42,740
that's kind of what I meant.

4940
02:11:43,290 --> 02:11:44,470
Kind of what I meant when,

4941
02:11:44,471 --> 02:11:46,980
when I'm talking about
what he can do in moment,

4942
02:11:47,140 --> 02:11:48,370
which is exactly what I'm.

4943
02:11:48,400 --> 02:11:48,740
Well,

4944
02:11:48,740 --> 02:11:49,180
if,

4945
02:11:49,180 --> 02:11:49,500
if you,

4946
02:11:49,500 --> 02:11:52,190
if your eye gets off season
of confidence from this,

4947
02:11:52,220 --> 02:11:52,700
good luck.

4948
02:11:52,700 --> 02:11:55,970
The next guy fights with Brendan.

4949
02:11:55,971 --> 02:11:56,550
I go,

4950
02:11:56,550 --> 02:11:59,870
if I'm like Brendan's making
all the valid points here,

4951
02:12:00,020 --> 02:12:00,853
but you are right.

4952
02:12:01,010 --> 02:12:01,731
We were both wrong.

4953
02:12:01,731 --> 02:12:05,960
But meanwhile he did threaten off his
back in the first round with that arm bar.

4954
02:12:05,990 --> 02:12:08,870
So you know that he is
working on his Jujitsu.

4955
02:12:09,020 --> 02:12:12,260
He's 100 percent working on his
Jujitsu because that was pretty slick.

4956
02:12:12,261 --> 02:12:16,670
The way set that up and he caught me
off guard was a high level of coach to

4957
02:12:16,760 --> 02:12:18,050
Jason Bailey is a monster.

4958
02:12:18,110 --> 02:12:20,810
Well I've been around
guys like that before.

4959
02:12:20,811 --> 02:12:21,051
The,

4960
02:12:21,051 --> 02:12:25,580
these guys who could pull off those
wild spinning techniques like from the

4961
02:12:25,580 --> 02:12:29,060
taekwondo days and I know like what a
high level looks like and his is a super

4962
02:12:29,061 --> 02:12:30,500
high level man and he's,

4963
02:12:30,530 --> 02:12:32,660
he's just so physically sharp.

4964
02:12:32,870 --> 02:12:34,070
Like he's so fast.

4965
02:12:34,340 --> 02:12:37,850
Like once he gets the technique down
and he obviously has it down perfect,

4966
02:12:38,180 --> 02:12:38,540
it's,

4967
02:12:38,540 --> 02:12:41,530
he can pull the trigger faster than
almost anybody you're gonna bring into

4968
02:12:41,540 --> 02:12:41,960
interstate.

4969
02:12:41,960 --> 02:12:43,740
There's really only one
knock on your right.

4970
02:12:43,741 --> 02:12:48,741
It's always been his mental state and
not a win over Musashi's fucking enormous

4971
02:12:49,220 --> 02:12:52,520
giant and it's just a
stoppage when jump spinning,

4972
02:12:52,521 --> 02:12:54,590
especially after coming
back for that first round,

4973
02:12:54,591 --> 02:12:54,801
right,

4974
02:12:54,801 --> 02:12:55,530
got destroyed.

4975
02:12:55,530 --> 02:12:57,340
Couldn't go down because of the mess.

4976
02:12:57,370 --> 02:12:57,640
Again.

4977
02:12:57,640 --> 02:13:01,070
The mental game can come from experience
because I remember Gary Goodrich back

4978
02:13:01,071 --> 02:13:02,270
when he first started fighting.

4979
02:13:02,420 --> 02:13:03,740
He tapped his first,

4980
02:13:03,741 --> 02:13:04,790
last or second last.

4981
02:13:04,880 --> 02:13:08,120
He would tap really quick just from the
stinging of the punches on the ground.

4982
02:13:08,300 --> 02:13:09,440
People were tapped to the stinging,

4983
02:13:09,770 --> 02:13:12,450
but then by the end of his
career he was kickboxing.

4984
02:13:12,470 --> 02:13:17,470
K One taken full blown and he learned
to survive and take those shots.

4985
02:13:19,490 --> 02:13:19,970
Yeah.

4986
02:13:19,970 --> 02:13:20,180
No,

4987
02:13:20,180 --> 02:13:21,250
he did and get,

4988
02:13:21,251 --> 02:13:21,470
you know,

4989
02:13:21,470 --> 02:13:25,160
Gary went on to fight some serious
fucking contenders in k one.

4990
02:13:25,161 --> 02:13:28,970
He fought some high level guys
in k one and an MMA to man.

4991
02:13:28,980 --> 02:13:30,970
Gary fought a lot of crazy fights.

4992
02:13:31,080 --> 02:13:32,560
Can we please see Uriah Hall

4993
02:13:32,560 --> 02:13:34,200
and Leo Machida next or what?

4994
02:13:36,120 --> 02:13:36,631
Joe Silva.

4995
02:13:36,631 --> 02:13:37,150
Your willpower.

4996
02:13:37,150 --> 02:13:39,030
Uriah hall versus Michael Bisping.

4997
02:13:39,210 --> 02:13:40,043
How about that?

4998
02:13:40,260 --> 02:13:43,230
Bisping has a fight against
whitaker and then Anderson said,

4999
02:13:43,231 --> 02:13:43,351
well,

5000
02:13:43,351 --> 02:13:44,220
wants to fight them after that.

5001
02:13:44,280 --> 02:13:45,390
I can't see whitaker,

5002
02:13:45,450 --> 02:13:46,530
whitaker in Australia.

5003
02:13:47,440 --> 02:13:48,273
Oh,

5004
02:13:49,830 --> 02:13:51,630
we used to fight at one 71.

5005
02:13:51,660 --> 02:13:51,900
Thanks.

5006
02:13:51,900 --> 02:13:53,940
So now he's going to
fight it in Australia.

5007
02:13:54,010 --> 02:13:54,950
Brisbane is on the card.

5008
02:13:55,110 --> 02:13:55,830
That's interesting.

5009
02:13:55,830 --> 02:13:56,191
Interesting.

5010
02:13:56,191 --> 02:13:56,460
Right?

5011
02:13:56,460 --> 02:13:58,240
Weird fight for who's with [inaudible].

5012
02:13:58,310 --> 02:13:59,143
Last two.

5013
02:13:59,500 --> 02:14:02,430
He got stopped by someone who
was like a really good striker.

5014
02:14:03,050 --> 02:14:03,260
Who.

5015
02:14:03,260 --> 02:14:04,093
What was that?

5016
02:14:07,610 --> 02:14:09,120
Robert Winter cruise record,

5017
02:14:09,390 --> 02:14:09,741
but that's a.

5018
02:14:09,741 --> 02:14:10,110
it's a.

5019
02:14:10,110 --> 02:14:10,591
it's a win.

5020
02:14:10,591 --> 02:14:12,450
Bids and told me that we're on
set and he told me that went.

5021
02:14:12,480 --> 02:14:14,010
That's an instinct fight for you.

5022
02:14:14,210 --> 02:14:14,531
Big,

5023
02:14:14,531 --> 02:14:14,891
big,

5024
02:14:14,891 --> 02:14:15,420
big,

5025
02:14:15,420 --> 02:14:17,070
big fucking wind for Uriah Hall.

5026
02:14:17,620 --> 02:14:18,600
Doesn't get much bigger than that.

5027
02:14:18,601 --> 02:14:19,620
Number six in the world.

5028
02:14:19,840 --> 02:14:20,940
He'll put you right in the top.

5029
02:14:20,941 --> 02:14:23,760
Ten makes Joe Rogan look like he knows
what the fuck he's talking about.

5030
02:14:23,760 --> 02:14:24,593
Oh Shit.

5031
02:14:25,470 --> 02:14:27,630
Whitaker lost a ton of Stephen Thompson.

5032
02:14:27,631 --> 02:14:28,290
That's the guy.

5033
02:14:28,290 --> 02:14:29,160
Wonderboy.

5034
02:14:29,161 --> 02:14:29,850
Wonderboy.

5035
02:14:29,850 --> 02:14:30,720
He's another one.

5036
02:14:30,870 --> 02:14:31,690
He has this.

5037
02:14:31,690 --> 02:14:36,000
When when he got more and more comfortable
with takedown defense and grappling,

5038
02:14:36,170 --> 02:14:38,610
he spent so much time with
Weidman working on his wrestling.

5039
02:14:38,940 --> 02:14:40,680
Then you got to see it
in the ellenberger fight.

5040
02:14:40,681 --> 02:14:43,400
You got to see what I'm mother
get confident because they don't.

5041
02:14:43,430 --> 02:14:47,030
They're not worried if the fight goes
down there and exactly if it does go down

5042
02:14:47,031 --> 02:14:47,864
and I'm all right,

5043
02:14:48,180 --> 02:14:51,240
well they know that they can defend
and I also know when there are,

5044
02:14:51,270 --> 02:14:52,500
when they are standing,

5045
02:14:52,830 --> 02:14:54,390
you can't fuck with wonderboy,

5046
02:14:54,391 --> 02:14:54,840
dude.

5047
02:14:54,840 --> 02:14:55,890
You gotta no one can.

5048
02:14:55,920 --> 02:14:58,470
It's also a different style because like,

5049
02:14:58,600 --> 02:14:59,970
just like your Ryan Hall,

5050
02:15:00,160 --> 02:15:04,740
your Bio Hall has more of a karate
style that he does a Thai style.

5051
02:15:04,920 --> 02:15:07,500
Like when he throws her
leg kicks and stuff,

5052
02:15:07,680 --> 02:15:08,970
when he throws round kicks,

5053
02:15:09,030 --> 02:15:13,260
he throws them like without like
the wind up so they land quicker.

5054
02:15:13,320 --> 02:15:14,153
Does not as much.

5055
02:15:14,280 --> 02:15:15,690
Like a lot of the Thai guys,

5056
02:15:15,691 --> 02:15:18,000
they're doing these steps and
everything is coming round.

5057
02:15:18,001 --> 02:15:18,601
They're chopping,

5058
02:15:18,601 --> 02:15:21,210
but everything's coming round
your riots throwing shit.

5059
02:15:21,250 --> 02:15:21,611
You,

5060
02:15:21,611 --> 02:15:22,444
you don't.

5061
02:15:22,470 --> 02:15:24,240
If you don't train with a guy like that,

5062
02:15:24,480 --> 02:15:25,850
you don't know those,

5063
02:15:25,880 --> 02:15:26,790
those movements,

5064
02:15:26,791 --> 02:15:27,624
you don't know,

5065
02:15:27,690 --> 02:15:27,961
Oh,

5066
02:15:27,961 --> 02:15:29,490
if I'm standing this close to him,

5067
02:15:29,491 --> 02:15:30,570
he can jump spinning back,

5068
02:15:30,571 --> 02:15:31,381
kick him in the face.

5069
02:15:31,381 --> 02:15:32,121
You're not training with that.

5070
02:15:32,121 --> 02:15:33,000
I can get away from him.

5071
02:15:33,160 --> 02:15:34,170
Bill machita effect.

5072
02:15:34,230 --> 02:15:35,610
When machita first came
on and guys were like,

5073
02:15:35,611 --> 02:15:36,360
what the fuck?

5074
02:15:36,360 --> 02:15:37,260
He can do more though.

5075
02:15:37,380 --> 02:15:38,820
Machida never did this,

5076
02:15:38,940 --> 02:15:40,200
but she didn't never did that.

5077
02:15:40,230 --> 02:15:45,230
He never did that in a fight like a horse
kicked machida would throw round kicks

5078
02:15:45,301 --> 02:15:48,720
and knees and punches and he did
that jumping front kick to random.

5079
02:15:48,780 --> 02:15:50,070
I'm saying at the time we did that,

5080
02:15:50,130 --> 02:15:53,880
people haven't seen it move in and out
and guys couldn't get the distance and

5081
02:15:53,881 --> 02:15:54,750
they get knocked out.

5082
02:15:54,780 --> 02:15:55,613
That's true.

5083
02:15:56,350 --> 02:15:58,890
I think gay guy thought he was safe and
then the eight a fucking healed of the

5084
02:15:58,891 --> 02:15:59,280
face.

5085
02:15:59,280 --> 02:15:59,641
Dude.

5086
02:15:59,641 --> 02:16:00,451
I mean that,

5087
02:16:00,451 --> 02:16:00,860
that,

5088
02:16:00,860 --> 02:16:05,310
that kind of speed from that distance
and the way he does it with no wind up,

5089
02:16:05,311 --> 02:16:05,820
man.

5090
02:16:05,820 --> 02:16:06,780
He's a crazy athlete.

5091
02:16:06,810 --> 02:16:08,190
There's no telegraphing it.

5092
02:16:08,370 --> 02:16:09,660
It's he's a great athlete,

5093
02:16:09,661 --> 02:16:11,970
but it's also intelligent preparation.

5094
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:12,270
True.

5095
02:16:12,270 --> 02:16:16,560
Because to train someone to throw those
things on a trigger like that with no

5096
02:16:16,561 --> 02:16:17,490
wind up at all,

5097
02:16:17,790 --> 02:16:18,541
like that's the.

5098
02:16:18,541 --> 02:16:22,140
That's the ultimate goal is to have an
athlete who's a really good athlete who

5099
02:16:22,141 --> 02:16:26,760
also listens and trains intelligently
to the point where there's no wind up.

5100
02:16:26,761 --> 02:16:27,900
He just jumps and kicks.

5101
02:16:27,920 --> 02:16:28,530
God Damn.

5102
02:16:28,530 --> 02:16:29,290
What a win.

5103
02:16:29,290 --> 02:16:30,040
What a fucking

5104
02:16:30,040 --> 02:16:30,873
wind for him.

5105
02:16:31,140 --> 02:16:32,100
Eddie could have made your money.

5106
02:16:32,590 --> 02:16:33,760
Tiger Schulman guy.

5107
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:34,990
Is that where he started?

5108
02:16:34,991 --> 02:16:35,710
Yes.

5109
02:16:35,710 --> 02:16:37,390
Is this amazing?

5110
02:16:37,970 --> 02:16:39,040
And his second degree.

5111
02:16:39,041 --> 02:16:39,611
Black Belt,

5112
02:16:39,611 --> 02:16:40,210
right?

5113
02:16:40,210 --> 02:16:41,020
I think so.

5114
02:16:41,020 --> 02:16:41,920
You know what's amazing?

5115
02:16:41,921 --> 02:16:43,480
Like Tiger Schulman was like play.

5116
02:16:43,500 --> 02:16:44,470
I'm looking at Jesus,

5117
02:16:44,500 --> 02:16:45,140
Dr. Don.

5118
02:16:45,140 --> 02:16:46,360
Just beautiful.

5119
02:16:46,840 --> 02:16:48,430
And then this nasty.

5120
02:16:48,490 --> 02:16:50,920
I think Musashi might've
thought it was a wheel kick.

5121
02:16:51,440 --> 02:16:53,230
Instead he hit him with
that jumped spinning back,

5122
02:16:53,231 --> 02:16:54,040
kick to the face.

5123
02:16:54,040 --> 02:16:54,370
God,

5124
02:16:54,370 --> 02:16:55,203
look at this.

5125
02:16:56,230 --> 02:16:57,490
Oh my goodness.

5126
02:16:58,120 --> 02:16:59,110
That is insane.

5127
02:17:00,200 --> 02:17:03,970
Oh my time timing this how people
expected you had to fight coming off the

5128
02:17:03,971 --> 02:17:04,804
ultimate fighter.

5129
02:17:04,890 --> 02:17:05,840
He lost that one slide.

5130
02:17:05,870 --> 02:17:08,820
There's a little bit of let down and
he's just doing work and their mindset

5131
02:17:08,890 --> 02:17:09,723
Palae.

5132
02:17:09,880 --> 02:17:10,061
Well,

5133
02:17:10,061 --> 02:17:10,841
you know what man,

5134
02:17:10,841 --> 02:17:13,420
if a fucking fight went the
way the first round went,

5135
02:17:13,600 --> 02:17:14,500
you wouldn't be saying this.

5136
02:17:14,501 --> 02:17:15,520
Which is what's amazing.

5137
02:17:16,060 --> 02:17:18,460
You know like you were
right and I was right.

5138
02:17:18,510 --> 02:17:19,390
We were both right,

5139
02:17:19,660 --> 02:17:20,650
but he figured it out.

5140
02:17:21,490 --> 02:17:22,323
He figured it out.

5141
02:17:22,390 --> 02:17:23,380
They made adjustments.

5142
02:17:23,580 --> 02:17:23,940
Good luck.

5143
02:17:23,940 --> 02:17:25,180
Whoever fights him next.

5144
02:17:25,390 --> 02:17:26,170
Well,

5145
02:17:26,170 --> 02:17:28,210
he's going to learn from
that first round to that.

5146
02:17:28,211 --> 02:17:29,650
That could happen to him in the grappling.

5147
02:17:29,651 --> 02:17:31,720
She's going to have to concentrate
on his grappling even more.

5148
02:17:31,721 --> 02:17:32,860
It's going to have to
bring it up to another,

5149
02:17:32,861 --> 02:17:36,810
but he knows he survived and
using some dangerous shit mounted.

5150
02:17:37,350 --> 02:17:38,760
He almost control.

5151
02:17:38,880 --> 02:17:39,071
I mean,

5152
02:17:39,071 --> 02:17:40,400
how close did he come to tap and dry?

5153
02:17:40,550 --> 02:17:41,770
A rear naked.

5154
02:17:42,440 --> 02:17:43,240
That was close.

5155
02:17:43,240 --> 02:17:44,073
That was close.

5156
02:17:44,430 --> 02:17:45,263
I think about that.

5157
02:17:45,290 --> 02:17:47,300
It makes the victory even sweeter.

5158
02:17:47,301 --> 02:17:48,280
It's an amazing win.

5159
02:17:48,670 --> 02:17:49,630
How about this fight?

5160
02:17:50,250 --> 02:17:52,060
This is not just DC verse.

5161
02:17:52,120 --> 02:17:53,400
It's a very interesting thing to enter.

5162
02:17:54,020 --> 02:17:54,300
You know,

5163
02:17:54,300 --> 02:17:55,390
you wonder what,

5164
02:17:55,840 --> 02:17:58,420
what Gustafson can do on the feet,

5165
02:17:58,480 --> 02:17:58,790
you know,

5166
02:17:58,790 --> 02:18:00,940
like can he keep dc off of them?

5167
02:18:01,420 --> 02:18:02,253
Yeah,

5168
02:18:02,260 --> 02:18:02,600
exactly.

5169
02:18:02,600 --> 02:18:03,433
Yeah.

5170
02:18:03,690 --> 02:18:04,690
Can You keep the fight standing?

5171
02:18:04,810 --> 02:18:07,480
Does he try to take dc down the
way he tried to take John Down.

5172
02:18:07,510 --> 02:18:08,343
Does he try to,

5173
02:18:08,610 --> 02:18:09,200
to,

5174
02:18:09,200 --> 02:18:10,960
to let them know really early on.

5175
02:18:11,110 --> 02:18:11,261
Hey,

5176
02:18:11,261 --> 02:18:12,250
I can take you down to.

5177
02:18:12,940 --> 02:18:14,020
Does he try to do what?

5178
02:18:14,350 --> 02:18:16,600
What Jones did take in DC down?

5179
02:18:16,720 --> 02:18:17,530
That's not happening.

5180
02:18:17,530 --> 02:18:18,281
You would say that,

5181
02:18:18,281 --> 02:18:18,990
but right.

5182
02:18:18,990 --> 02:18:22,540
You would take Jones down either
took him down twice different though.

5183
02:18:22,690 --> 02:18:25,360
Well also you got to
think it took dc down the,

5184
02:18:25,670 --> 02:18:30,280
but the word was that John did not take
the Gustafson fight very seriously and

5185
02:18:30,281 --> 02:18:30,640
training.

5186
02:18:30,640 --> 02:18:31,473
That's what I've heard.

5187
02:18:31,630 --> 02:18:32,460
That is the.

5188
02:18:32,460 --> 02:18:33,161
That is the world.

5189
02:18:33,161 --> 02:18:34,210
We're not lying about that.

5190
02:18:35,440 --> 02:18:38,360
Whether or not that would have played a
factor with Annette Gustafson would've

5191
02:18:38,370 --> 02:18:39,940
have been able to take them down anyway.

5192
02:18:40,270 --> 02:18:40,780
We don't know.

5193
02:18:40,780 --> 02:18:43,300
I feel like this fight
thinking enough hype,

5194
02:18:43,660 --> 02:18:44,493
getting no hype,

5195
02:18:44,500 --> 02:18:45,040
zero hype.

5196
02:18:45,040 --> 02:18:47,770
I haven't heard anybody talk about
it because John Jones is right there.

5197
02:18:47,790 --> 02:18:50,110
So elephant in the room.

5198
02:18:50,170 --> 02:18:51,220
Will John be both of them?

5199
02:18:51,221 --> 02:18:51,641
So it's like,

5200
02:18:51,641 --> 02:18:52,031
all right,

5201
02:18:52,031 --> 02:18:52,960
well there you go.

5202
02:18:52,970 --> 02:18:53,920
And he said he just nailed it.

5203
02:18:55,120 --> 02:18:55,960
That's exactly what it is.

5204
02:18:56,740 --> 02:18:57,570
Zero hype.

5205
02:18:57,570 --> 02:19:00,370
I mean John is just so everybody knows.

5206
02:19:00,400 --> 02:19:01,233
He's so good.

5207
02:19:01,240 --> 02:19:02,260
He's so special.

5208
02:19:02,440 --> 02:19:04,390
And that's also what's tragic about it.

5209
02:19:04,660 --> 02:19:07,270
You know when a great
comeback story though.

5210
02:19:07,360 --> 02:19:07,930
Amazing.

5211
02:19:07,930 --> 02:19:08,770
If he could pull it off.

5212
02:19:08,800 --> 02:19:09,633
It's amazing.

5213
02:19:11,290 --> 02:19:12,050
Josh Barnett,

5214
02:19:12,050 --> 02:19:13,780
them triathlon runner,

5215
02:19:13,810 --> 02:19:15,220
look at their records.

5216
02:19:15,280 --> 02:19:17,010
Just a ton of fight.

5217
02:19:18,580 --> 02:19:20,770
Josh Barnett look leaner
than I've ever seen him ever.

5218
02:19:20,830 --> 02:19:22,240
So the best shape I've ever seen him.

5219
02:19:23,170 --> 02:19:24,003
How much did he weigh?

5220
02:19:25,270 --> 02:19:26,103
Good question.

5221
02:19:26,620 --> 02:19:29,520
He still has to be 50 you think forties?

5222
02:19:29,660 --> 02:19:30,320
For sure.

5223
02:19:30,320 --> 02:19:31,220
He's a bad boy.

5224
02:19:31,250 --> 02:19:32,083
What's the guests?

5225
02:19:32,150 --> 02:19:32,983
How much Josh Barnett?

5226
02:19:34,080 --> 02:19:34,970
If he was

5227
02:19:36,550 --> 02:19:37,880
to 40 to 45,

5228
02:19:37,910 --> 02:19:39,530
I'll say 48 to 48.

5229
02:19:39,620 --> 02:19:42,770
Can we find out and say
we'll find down here?

5230
02:19:43,790 --> 02:19:44,210
40th five.

5231
02:19:44,210 --> 02:19:45,860
It was the same.

5232
02:19:45,920 --> 02:19:46,790
We need the official.

5233
02:19:46,800 --> 02:19:47,900
Wayne's not the old one.

5234
02:19:48,370 --> 02:19:48,760
Yeah.

5235
02:19:48,760 --> 02:19:49,080
The,

5236
02:19:49,080 --> 02:19:50,080
the problem is they,

5237
02:19:50,330 --> 02:19:51,680
a lot of times when they,

5238
02:19:51,710 --> 02:19:53,360
like when I read these things off,

5239
02:19:53,610 --> 02:19:54,443
uh,

5240
02:19:54,650 --> 02:19:55,483
at the fights,

5241
02:19:55,580 --> 02:19:56,620
like they have a uh,

5242
02:19:56,621 --> 02:19:57,470
a tale of the tape.

5243
02:19:57,740 --> 02:19:59,350
Maybe we go to the video of the wind.

5244
02:19:59,990 --> 02:20:00,823
It's got to be there.

5245
02:20:00,950 --> 02:20:02,510
But what I'm saying is for heavyweights,

5246
02:20:02,840 --> 02:20:04,250
the only way you uh,

5247
02:20:04,310 --> 02:20:06,830
you hear it as if like Bruce
buffer sandy correctly.

5248
02:20:07,490 --> 02:20:10,700
Thirty nine because like sometimes
on my sheet that I'll get like say,

5249
02:20:10,701 --> 02:20:10,941
you know,

5250
02:20:10,941 --> 02:20:14,570
I get a sheet from the UFC that shows a
fighters record and I'll get the weight

5251
02:20:14,600 --> 02:20:16,340
that they use to weigh in other fights.

5252
02:20:16,700 --> 02:20:18,770
Sometimes there'll be heavier or lighter.

5253
02:20:18,790 --> 02:20:19,491
So what does it says?

5254
02:20:19,491 --> 02:20:20,180
Two 39.

5255
02:20:20,180 --> 02:20:20,511
Whoa.

5256
02:20:20,511 --> 02:20:22,040
Nelson to 69.

5257
02:20:22,310 --> 02:20:23,143
Whoa.

5258
02:20:23,870 --> 02:20:26,180
So he was over by four pounds.

5259
02:20:26,181 --> 02:20:29,570
I forgot he Barnett
was 2:39 who said 2:39.

5260
02:20:30,860 --> 02:20:31,551
Powerful Jamie.

5261
02:20:31,551 --> 02:20:32,384
Nailed it.

5262
02:20:32,470 --> 02:20:32,870
Uh,

5263
02:20:32,870 --> 02:20:33,320
hold up.

5264
02:20:33,320 --> 02:20:33,981
He can't be two,

5265
02:20:33,981 --> 02:20:34,570
six and a handle.

5266
02:20:34,570 --> 02:20:36,540
Otherwise the appellant is right.

5267
02:20:36,710 --> 02:20:39,560
Must have had to either give up 20
percent of his purse or lose the weight.

5268
02:20:39,630 --> 02:20:41,210
The hold up bro got fatter.

5269
02:20:41,900 --> 02:20:42,980
Maybe he lost the weight.

5270
02:20:43,460 --> 02:20:44,121
Wouldn't be hard,

5271
02:20:44,121 --> 02:20:44,900
right?

5272
02:20:44,900 --> 02:20:46,460
I don't know Bro.

5273
02:20:46,610 --> 02:20:48,980
He probably was shocked
that Uriah Hall flooded.

5274
02:20:48,981 --> 02:20:49,910
I still can't get over this.

5275
02:20:49,911 --> 02:20:50,744
Fucking amazing.

5276
02:20:50,820 --> 02:20:51,653
Yeah.

5277
02:20:51,730 --> 02:20:52,470
And it was.

5278
02:20:52,470 --> 02:20:53,310
We were saying this,

5279
02:20:53,390 --> 02:20:54,590
he can do some shit,

5280
02:20:54,591 --> 02:20:54,921
man,

5281
02:20:54,921 --> 02:20:56,660
that guys can do.

5282
02:20:57,890 --> 02:20:59,300
And I knew guys like that.

5283
02:20:59,301 --> 02:21:02,390
I knew a lot of guys like
that from my a taekwondo days.

5284
02:21:02,570 --> 02:21:06,230
There was guys that just had
this ability to explode with,

5285
02:21:06,231 --> 02:21:06,490
uh,

5286
02:21:06,490 --> 02:21:09,920
with lightening fast spinning techniques
that if you weren't ready for it,

5287
02:21:10,730 --> 02:21:11,750
do you got lit up?

5288
02:21:12,080 --> 02:21:17,080
You got fucked up a fucking rothwell
and a steep air fighting real soon.

5289
02:21:17,901 --> 02:21:18,171
Right?

5290
02:21:18,171 --> 02:21:19,004
That's a great fight.

5291
02:21:19,790 --> 02:21:20,720
There was this kid that I said,

5292
02:21:20,721 --> 02:21:21,554
no,

5293
02:21:21,560 --> 02:21:22,910
his name is Larry Jones.

5294
02:21:23,030 --> 02:21:25,700
And his legs went all
the way up to his ribs.

5295
02:21:25,970 --> 02:21:27,650
His hips like started here.

5296
02:21:27,651 --> 02:21:28,760
He was a tall dude.

5297
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:30,560
He was like six foot three,

5298
02:21:30,561 --> 02:21:32,030
maybe somewhere around then.

5299
02:21:32,031 --> 02:21:35,210
But his legs were like way
longer than he was tired.

5300
02:21:35,300 --> 02:21:36,200
He looked like the monster.

5301
02:21:36,880 --> 02:21:39,770
He had legs that were perfectly
designed for kicking you.

5302
02:21:40,130 --> 02:21:41,270
And this guy,

5303
02:21:41,330 --> 02:21:44,660
when I wouldn't talk
about like talented dudes,

5304
02:21:44,661 --> 02:21:48,110
like physically talented dudes who could
throw kicks that no one saw coming.

5305
02:21:48,350 --> 02:21:52,490
I used to watch this guy kick like
the bag and I would just be marveled,

5306
02:21:52,760 --> 02:21:53,720
just like marbled look.

5307
02:21:53,721 --> 02:21:56,000
I couldn't believe what
he could do with his legs.

5308
02:21:56,210 --> 02:22:00,200
He would throw these front leg side kick
that which has been this bag in half

5309
02:22:00,210 --> 02:22:01,250
because he was a big dude.

5310
02:22:01,490 --> 02:22:01,700
You know,

5311
02:22:01,700 --> 02:22:06,050
Larry was probably like
220 natural pounds,

5312
02:22:06,110 --> 02:22:07,040
six with three lien.

5313
02:22:07,041 --> 02:22:07,970
Didn't lift any weights,

5314
02:22:08,030 --> 02:22:09,560
built for kicking bail for kicking.

5315
02:22:09,830 --> 02:22:10,251
Like his,

5316
02:22:10,251 --> 02:22:11,240
all of his weight.

5317
02:22:11,350 --> 02:22:12,150
I mean it might,

5318
02:22:12,150 --> 02:22:13,250
might not have been even that heavy.

5319
02:22:13,251 --> 02:22:15,170
It might've been like 200 pounds
now that I think about it.

5320
02:22:15,171 --> 02:22:16,910
But he wasn't a weight lifter at all.

5321
02:22:16,970 --> 02:22:20,360
Like it was all just throwing kicks and
running up hills and shit like that.

5322
02:22:20,660 --> 02:22:21,140
But he would,

5323
02:22:21,140 --> 02:22:22,610
he would kick the bag and you just go,

5324
02:22:22,611 --> 02:22:24,140
what the fuck man?

5325
02:22:24,530 --> 02:22:26,010
Like you'd never seen anything like

5326
02:22:26,010 --> 02:22:26,101
it.

5327
02:22:26,101 --> 02:22:27,810
He would throw these spinning techniques.

5328
02:22:28,020 --> 02:22:29,430
And ever since that I was like,

5329
02:22:29,460 --> 02:22:29,581
well,

5330
02:22:29,581 --> 02:22:32,610
how come I haven't seen a guy who
couldn't move like that in mma?

5331
02:22:32,700 --> 02:22:35,160
And then you start slowly
seemed like Barboza can do it,

5332
02:22:35,390 --> 02:22:35,700
you know,

5333
02:22:35,700 --> 02:22:36,690
a few other guys could do it.

5334
02:22:36,691 --> 02:22:38,820
They can move like that with that
kind of speed and their spins.

5335
02:22:40,560 --> 02:22:42,930
Barboza has the quickest kicks
I've ever seen in my life.

5336
02:22:43,080 --> 02:22:43,590
Never,

5337
02:22:43,590 --> 02:22:44,550
never seen anybody quick.

5338
02:22:44,551 --> 02:22:46,190
Does he have a fight scheduled hopes?

5339
02:22:46,200 --> 02:22:47,033
I don't think so.

5340
02:22:49,420 --> 02:22:51,630
I was telling Michael Jai White,

5341
02:22:51,631 --> 02:22:51,940
you know,

5342
02:22:51,940 --> 02:22:54,210
his big giant karate guy.

5343
02:22:54,530 --> 02:22:55,030
I was,

5344
02:22:55,030 --> 02:22:59,970
I was just telling him about Joe Rogan's
turn inside kicks and all the stories

5345
02:22:59,971 --> 02:23:00,804
and all that shit.

5346
02:23:00,960 --> 02:23:01,890
And he's at my gym.

5347
02:23:02,190 --> 02:23:02,641
He's big.

5348
02:23:02,641 --> 02:23:03,630
He's like six foot four,

5349
02:23:03,810 --> 02:23:04,950
240 pounds.

5350
02:23:05,190 --> 02:23:06,510
Did Karate his whole life and shit.

5351
02:23:06,900 --> 02:23:07,733
And I'm telling,

5352
02:23:07,770 --> 02:23:09,480
telling them about Joe
Rogan's turning psychic,

5353
02:23:09,481 --> 02:23:10,350
how amazing it is.

5354
02:23:10,650 --> 02:23:10,981
And he goes,

5355
02:23:10,981 --> 02:23:11,221
okay,

5356
02:23:11,221 --> 02:23:12,150
let that go.

5357
02:23:12,151 --> 02:23:12,970
Let me see you.

5358
02:23:12,970 --> 02:23:13,320
Let me.

5359
02:23:13,320 --> 02:23:14,190
Let me see you throw one.

5360
02:23:14,191 --> 02:23:14,941
So he throws one.

5361
02:23:14,941 --> 02:23:16,110
After all the Shit I've talked about,

5362
02:23:16,111 --> 02:23:19,020
Joe at legends were Tenth
Planet Headquarters used to be.

5363
02:23:19,380 --> 02:23:21,380
He fucking throws one turn inside.

5364
02:23:21,390 --> 02:23:26,390
Kik breaks the bag off your
breaks it all the psyllium lands.

5365
02:23:28,321 --> 02:23:28,770
I'm like,

5366
02:23:28,770 --> 02:23:29,700
oh shit,

5367
02:23:29,701 --> 02:23:31,410
Chris Riley's going to be fucking pissed.

5368
02:23:31,560 --> 02:23:32,760
We're trying to put it back up.

5369
02:23:32,830 --> 02:23:33,820
I'm holding the backup.

5370
02:23:33,980 --> 02:23:36,570
It's like the chain totally broke off.

5371
02:23:36,780 --> 02:23:37,860
And then we just left it on the,

5372
02:23:37,861 --> 02:23:40,560
on the ground as a ground and pound a bag.

5373
02:23:40,561 --> 02:23:42,370
But kinda like,

5374
02:23:42,420 --> 02:23:43,970
I couldn't say anything
about Joe Rogan anymore.

5375
02:23:43,980 --> 02:23:44,310
I'm like,

5376
02:23:44,310 --> 02:23:45,430
this motherfucker just broke.

5377
02:23:45,431 --> 02:23:45,780
Michael.

5378
02:23:45,780 --> 02:23:47,690
Shy White is an athlete too.

5379
02:23:47,850 --> 02:23:49,300
He has his clean

5380
02:23:51,340 --> 02:23:51,670
fuck.

5381
02:23:51,670 --> 02:23:54,030
He's got clean karate technique man.

5382
02:23:54,031 --> 02:23:54,301
And he,

5383
02:23:54,301 --> 02:23:54,631
he,

5384
02:23:54,631 --> 02:23:59,030
I think he hopping side kicked
it right inside the blue.

5385
02:23:59,100 --> 02:24:00,480
The bag off the ceiling.

5386
02:24:00,660 --> 02:24:01,493
Yeah.

5387
02:24:02,490 --> 02:24:04,630
They weren't very good at keeping
those bags on the ceiling.

5388
02:24:08,870 --> 02:24:10,840
I broke that chain that

5389
02:24:13,450 --> 02:24:16,720
I was telling you about the video
with GSP and going to block.

5390
02:24:17,010 --> 02:24:17,940
That was a different bag though.

5391
02:24:17,941 --> 02:24:21,180
Remember that was a center bag and the
GSP bag as a bar back to the far right.

5392
02:24:21,570 --> 02:24:22,800
A couple people broke that back,

5393
02:24:22,801 --> 02:24:27,330
but you got to be a motherfucker to break
that pack that Shane was like really?

5394
02:24:27,420 --> 02:24:28,050
Chintzy.

5395
02:24:28,050 --> 02:24:28,321
Oh,

5396
02:24:28,321 --> 02:24:28,830
okay.

5397
02:24:28,830 --> 02:24:29,790
But when he hit it,

5398
02:24:29,910 --> 02:24:30,810
he hit it perfect.

5399
02:24:31,330 --> 02:24:31,660
No,

5400
02:24:31,660 --> 02:24:33,450
but I've seen him do a
lot of other stuff too.

5401
02:24:33,451 --> 02:24:34,740
I've seen him throw a lot of kicks.

5402
02:24:34,950 --> 02:24:36,050
He Kicks Holy Shit.

5403
02:24:36,140 --> 02:24:36,973
Real

5404
02:24:38,360 --> 02:24:38,550
well.

5405
02:24:38,550 --> 02:24:38,821
He's,

5406
02:24:38,821 --> 02:24:39,654
you know,

5407
02:24:40,200 --> 02:24:41,280
he's a super athlete.

5408
02:24:41,281 --> 02:24:43,470
Like when you watch Michael
Jai white in movies,

5409
02:24:43,471 --> 02:24:44,630
like watch them and do all that stuff.

5410
02:24:44,631 --> 02:24:46,590
And movies like that guy
could do that shit for real.

5411
02:24:46,620 --> 02:24:47,520
What's he do now?

5412
02:24:47,700 --> 02:24:48,533
He makes movies,

5413
02:24:48,540 --> 02:24:49,590
TV shows and Shit.

5414
02:24:49,591 --> 02:24:50,490
He's always doing something.

5415
02:24:50,491 --> 02:24:50,760
I saw.

5416
02:24:50,760 --> 02:24:51,593
I'm always staying.

5417
02:24:52,670 --> 02:24:57,270
I coordinated some fights for never
backed down to somebody his bike.

5418
02:24:57,510 --> 02:24:59,350
He wanted some high
level Jujitsu in there.

5419
02:24:59,610 --> 02:25:00,330
And if you've got it,

5420
02:25:00,330 --> 02:25:03,870
have you watched her back down to do
these twists during and Crotch or ripping

5421
02:25:03,871 --> 02:25:04,350
people?

5422
02:25:04,350 --> 02:25:04,950
Oh yeah,

5423
02:25:04,950 --> 02:25:05,581
that's right.

5424
02:25:05,581 --> 02:25:08,870
I forgot when you guys went
down there for the crazy.

5425
02:25:08,880 --> 02:25:09,713
How,

5426
02:25:09,870 --> 02:25:12,600
how quickly and on the spot those fights.

5427
02:25:12,660 --> 02:25:12,810
Uh,

5428
02:25:12,810 --> 02:25:12,990
uh,

5429
02:25:12,990 --> 02:25:15,710
get put together because we're
just on the set figuring it out.

5430
02:25:15,711 --> 02:25:15,931
We're like,

5431
02:25:15,931 --> 02:25:16,261
okay,

5432
02:25:16,261 --> 02:25:17,430
this next flight we need to.

5433
02:25:17,720 --> 02:25:21,720
We have like a basic idea that we go
over like three times and we just start

5434
02:25:21,721 --> 02:25:22,290
filming.

5435
02:25:22,290 --> 02:25:22,710
I'll just,

5436
02:25:22,710 --> 02:25:24,040
the I've ever seen Roy.

5437
02:25:24,450 --> 02:25:25,590
He's preached Bonnie Lens.

5438
02:25:25,600 --> 02:25:26,351
That ain't good.

5439
02:25:26,351 --> 02:25:27,540
God is good.

5440
02:25:27,820 --> 02:25:28,660
Our guts on.

5441
02:25:28,750 --> 02:25:29,231
I don't know.

5442
02:25:29,231 --> 02:25:30,010
It might be.

5443
02:25:30,010 --> 02:25:30,791
Maybe not though,

5444
02:25:30,791 --> 02:25:31,030
right?

5445
02:25:31,030 --> 02:25:31,721
Oh my God.

5446
02:25:31,721 --> 02:25:32,680
If I lose this one,

5447
02:25:32,681 --> 02:25:34,660
that's $2,000 spent on Roy.

5448
02:25:34,750 --> 02:25:35,370
Did you bet on?

5449
02:25:35,370 --> 02:25:35,650
No,

5450
02:25:35,650 --> 02:25:36,390
no,

5451
02:25:36,390 --> 02:25:37,223
no.

5452
02:25:37,430 --> 02:25:38,980
But it seems like a short bat.

5453
02:25:39,310 --> 02:25:40,380
But anything that happens,

5454
02:25:40,390 --> 02:25:40,931
no shorts,

5455
02:25:40,931 --> 02:25:41,640
no shirt.

5456
02:25:41,640 --> 02:25:42,310
But yes.

5457
02:25:42,310 --> 02:25:43,990
When a do punches as hard as roy does,

5458
02:25:44,050 --> 02:25:44,681
fucking never.

5459
02:25:44,681 --> 02:25:45,340
No ma'am.

5460
02:25:45,340 --> 02:25:47,440
I just think Barnett's
gonna close the distance.

5461
02:25:47,500 --> 02:25:49,360
Drag them to the Mat and do work.

5462
02:25:50,260 --> 02:25:50,621
Michael.

5463
02:25:50,621 --> 02:25:52,270
Jai White is a black
belt and kill Christian.

5464
02:25:52,300 --> 02:25:54,550
The journey to zero begins now.

5465
02:25:54,580 --> 02:25:55,180
Bring it.

5466
02:25:55,180 --> 02:25:55,421
You know,

5467
02:25:55,421 --> 02:25:56,380
John Wayne has done that.

5468
02:25:56,610 --> 02:25:59,230
You have to spar like
multiple people in a day.

5469
02:25:59,440 --> 02:26:00,191
He's done those,

5470
02:26:00,191 --> 02:26:02,840
those crazy killed Christian
competitions where you know,

5471
02:26:02,850 --> 02:26:04,010
like to get your black publish,

5472
02:26:04,020 --> 02:26:04,451
something like that.

5473
02:26:04,451 --> 02:26:07,120
They may fight like fucking 10 different
talks about that on my podcast.

5474
02:26:07,450 --> 02:26:08,710
30 guys in one day.

5475
02:26:09,830 --> 02:26:10,421
That's real.

5476
02:26:10,421 --> 02:26:12,190
They'll will make you spar like 30 guys,

5477
02:26:12,191 --> 02:26:14,020
like each guy has a few minutes.

5478
02:26:15,160 --> 02:26:15,993
It was

5479
02:26:17,280 --> 02:26:18,760
so fast and so strong.

5480
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:21,160
I'm sure there is no problem for him.

5481
02:26:21,290 --> 02:26:24,550
He's a weird style too because they,

5482
02:26:24,551 --> 02:26:24,761
uh,

5483
02:26:24,761 --> 02:26:29,110
they punched full blast to the body and
then they kick full blast of the head

5484
02:26:29,260 --> 02:26:31,960
and they stand right in front of each
other and they don't wear any pants.

5485
02:26:32,260 --> 02:26:33,040
So there's like,

5486
02:26:33,040 --> 02:26:33,790
there's a lot of like,

5487
02:26:33,790 --> 02:26:36,430
you can't go nowhere or punched,

5488
02:26:36,820 --> 02:26:37,653
kicked to that.

5489
02:26:37,740 --> 02:26:38,340
You can.

5490
02:26:38,340 --> 02:26:38,610
Yeah,

5491
02:26:38,610 --> 02:26:39,443
that's a weird fucking.

5492
02:26:39,820 --> 02:26:43,030
Those guys went off into a kickboxing.

5493
02:26:43,440 --> 02:26:44,290
A lot of those guys.

5494
02:26:44,291 --> 02:26:44,620
Uh,

5495
02:26:44,620 --> 02:26:45,850
in the early days of kickbox,

5496
02:26:45,851 --> 02:26:46,750
a lot of those guys were killed.

5497
02:26:46,751 --> 02:26:49,390
Christian guys that learned
a learn how to punch,

5498
02:26:50,050 --> 02:26:51,790
learn how to punch the face or not a box,

5499
02:26:51,850 --> 02:26:52,300
you know,

5500
02:26:52,300 --> 02:26:53,680
but they're kicks were extraordinary.

5501
02:26:53,950 --> 02:26:56,490
They would throw kicks from real
weird angles because they were,

5502
02:26:56,740 --> 02:27:00,220
they were like standing rock 'em sock
'em robots style right in front of each

5503
02:27:00,221 --> 02:27:01,054
other sometimes.

5504
02:27:01,090 --> 02:27:02,560
And then throw those chopping.

5505
02:27:02,920 --> 02:27:03,570
Like,

5506
02:27:03,570 --> 02:27:06,480
I'm pretty sure our fate
ptosis first style was,

5507
02:27:06,490 --> 02:27:06,820
uh,

5508
02:27:06,820 --> 02:27:07,660
was killed Christian.

5509
02:27:08,940 --> 02:27:10,840
A lot of those guys would
throw that Brazilian kick.

5510
02:27:10,870 --> 02:27:12,670
That was like part of the style.

5511
02:27:12,671 --> 02:27:13,970
The Brazilian.

5512
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:14,330
Okay.

5513
02:27:14,330 --> 02:27:17,130
One who was throwing
axe kicks his feet Toso,

5514
02:27:17,131 --> 02:27:17,600
right?

5515
02:27:17,600 --> 02:27:17,930
No,

5516
02:27:17,930 --> 02:27:18,763
that was another guy.

5517
02:27:18,930 --> 02:27:19,763
It was like,

5518
02:27:19,820 --> 02:27:21,530
was it feel Francisco,

5519
02:27:21,540 --> 02:27:26,270
feel whole feel both of them
glob safely Tosa and feel the

5520
02:27:28,460 --> 02:27:29,740
kicks landed in mma yet?

5521
02:27:30,240 --> 02:27:30,880
Not really.

5522
02:27:30,880 --> 02:27:31,481
We haven't seen that.

5523
02:27:31,481 --> 02:27:33,920
We've seen Allen Joel bonds throwing.

5524
02:27:34,150 --> 02:27:35,680
He's known for cartwheel kicks.

5525
02:27:35,850 --> 02:27:36,820
How crazy is that?

5526
02:27:37,180 --> 02:27:37,451
Yeah.

5527
02:27:37,451 --> 02:27:38,680
So was um,

5528
02:27:38,880 --> 02:27:39,190
uh,

5529
02:27:39,190 --> 02:27:39,910
what's his name?

5530
02:27:39,910 --> 02:27:40,743
Anthony Pettis.

5531
02:27:40,780 --> 02:27:42,670
The White Anderson Silva flux.

5532
02:27:44,620 --> 02:27:45,453
Brian Ebersol,

5533
02:27:45,480 --> 02:27:45,960
they would call him.

5534
02:27:45,960 --> 02:27:46,220
He,

5535
02:27:46,220 --> 02:27:47,053
it was just joking.

5536
02:27:48,170 --> 02:27:52,630
That was his nickname was two a
dot m dot s dot gets ridiculous.

5537
02:27:53,720 --> 02:27:55,930
Was a silly dude.

5538
02:27:56,170 --> 02:27:57,460
He's a dude that he just retired

5539
02:27:59,820 --> 02:28:01,850
like a successful podcast,

5540
02:28:01,870 --> 02:28:02,110
right?

5541
02:28:02,110 --> 02:28:05,140
Sure son and Holy Shit Dude,

5542
02:28:05,410 --> 02:28:07,060
he is a murderer.

5543
02:28:07,110 --> 02:28:09,550
And if you heard his
podcast is a great crushing,

5544
02:28:10,120 --> 02:28:10,920
smashes.

5545
02:28:10,920 --> 02:28:11,670
Perfect.

5546
02:28:11,670 --> 02:28:13,180
He's going to be the new Jim Rome.

5547
02:28:13,210 --> 02:28:14,440
He's so good.

5548
02:28:14,441 --> 02:28:17,950
It's perfect for just signs were a world
series of fighting to play by play.

5549
02:28:18,100 --> 02:28:18,933
Good.

5550
02:28:19,330 --> 02:28:19,901
Look man,

5551
02:28:19,901 --> 02:28:20,734
like I can talk.

5552
02:28:20,770 --> 02:28:22,040
Son is one of the

5553
02:28:22,420 --> 02:28:22,661
top.

5554
02:28:22,661 --> 02:28:23,720
Conor mcgregor came along.

5555
02:28:23,750 --> 02:28:25,430
I said he was the greatest
shit talker of all time,

5556
02:28:25,730 --> 02:28:27,140
but kind of took shit to another watch.

5557
02:28:27,141 --> 02:28:28,100
The ultimate fighter.

5558
02:28:28,180 --> 02:28:28,950
Oh Man.

5559
02:28:28,950 --> 02:28:32,450
Because his wicked with shit-talking.

5560
02:28:32,480 --> 02:28:33,560
Look at Josh Barnett.

5561
02:28:33,561 --> 02:28:34,760
Lean as fuck.

5562
02:28:34,970 --> 02:28:36,890
Trying to get that modeling contracts on.

5563
02:28:37,020 --> 02:28:37,821
Said fuck this.

5564
02:28:37,821 --> 02:28:38,060
Fuck.

5565
02:28:38,060 --> 02:28:40,070
He's been hanging out with
Victor Webster too much.

5566
02:28:40,140 --> 02:28:42,830
Hasn't even been doing a
lot of movies and movies.

5567
02:28:43,510 --> 02:28:46,670
A lot of acting and he's been doing
some wrestling stuff in Japan.

5568
02:28:46,671 --> 02:28:48,140
Like the fake pro wrestling.

5569
02:28:48,440 --> 02:28:49,273
Don't say fake pro.

5570
02:28:49,310 --> 02:28:49,760
Sorry.

5571
02:28:49,760 --> 02:28:51,170
Customers in Japan right now.

5572
02:28:51,171 --> 02:28:51,271
There.

5573
02:28:51,271 --> 02:28:52,104
You're right.

5574
02:28:52,330 --> 02:28:53,570
I'm Josh Barnett.

5575
02:28:53,870 --> 02:28:54,700
Best.

5576
02:28:54,700 --> 02:28:56,630
Almost 40 to 61.

5577
02:28:56,631 --> 02:28:57,464
It says why?

5578
02:28:57,680 --> 02:28:57,850
Why?

5579
02:28:57,850 --> 02:28:58,880
No one's a hipster,

5580
02:28:59,090 --> 02:28:59,481
but hey.

5581
02:28:59,481 --> 02:29:03,050
Well why does it take to 61 that
got it's tough on that belly.

5582
02:29:03,580 --> 02:29:05,360
Is it to 69 or [inaudible] 61.

5583
02:29:06,050 --> 02:29:06,980
It says one to me.

5584
02:29:07,130 --> 02:29:10,190
He probably took a giant shit and he
came in and weighed himself again and he

5585
02:29:10,191 --> 02:29:11,090
was two 61

5586
02:29:12,630 --> 02:29:13,510
to 61.

5587
02:29:13,960 --> 02:29:14,793
Okay.

5588
02:29:15,740 --> 02:29:17,540
Ties off Bruce Buffer.

5589
02:29:18,030 --> 02:29:19,190
I was on his podcast.

5590
02:29:19,370 --> 02:29:20,720
That motherfucker can host.

5591
02:29:20,721 --> 02:29:21,650
Have you been on Bruce puffers?

5592
02:29:21,680 --> 02:29:22,101
Podcast?

5593
02:29:22,101 --> 02:29:25,150
I've been a natural host.

5594
02:29:25,151 --> 02:29:25,850
I was just.

5595
02:29:25,850 --> 02:29:28,100
I was shocked how good he was.

5596
02:29:28,250 --> 02:29:29,950
That guy is a professional house.

5597
02:29:29,960 --> 02:29:30,471
He's really,

5598
02:29:30,471 --> 02:29:31,010
really good.

5599
02:29:31,010 --> 02:29:33,110
We'll think about how good
he is in route and announcer.

5600
02:29:33,140 --> 02:29:33,973
No one's better.

5601
02:29:34,190 --> 02:29:37,730
Never been a big difference between ring
announcer and holding down a shovel.

5602
02:29:37,731 --> 02:29:38,960
He has no off button.

5603
02:29:38,961 --> 02:29:39,830
He has no off button.

5604
02:29:39,831 --> 02:29:42,860
I've seen him in at
restaurants in fucking Venice.

5605
02:29:43,040 --> 02:29:44,510
Who like Brendon and shop.

5606
02:29:44,511 --> 02:29:45,620
How you doing?

5607
02:29:45,650 --> 02:29:47,830
Just getting back from my karate lessons.

5608
02:29:48,050 --> 02:29:48,883
Bruce Buffer.

5609
02:29:49,130 --> 02:29:51,770
When we survey coming back from Abu Dhabi,

5610
02:29:51,940 --> 02:29:52,281
uh,

5611
02:29:52,281 --> 02:29:54,860
he hugged my ass up man.

5612
02:29:55,050 --> 02:29:56,150
He hooked me up,

5613
02:29:56,240 --> 02:29:56,750
man.

5614
02:29:56,750 --> 02:29:57,583
Bruce Buffer.

5615
02:29:57,660 --> 02:29:58,940
Leave a man.

5616
02:29:58,941 --> 02:29:59,691
It's a long story.

5617
02:29:59,691 --> 02:30:00,590
But he got me.

5618
02:30:00,591 --> 02:30:03,410
He used all his miles to
get me a business class.

5619
02:30:03,411 --> 02:30:05,490
I had economy coming back from Sao Paulo,

5620
02:30:05,550 --> 02:30:05,950
man.

5621
02:30:05,950 --> 02:30:06,140
Yeah.

5622
02:30:06,140 --> 02:30:07,220
He was so cool.

5623
02:30:07,221 --> 02:30:08,880
He hooked it all up and
like when you don't have to.

5624
02:30:09,050 --> 02:30:09,710
I,

5625
02:30:09,710 --> 02:30:11,870
I needed like 50,000
miles or something to do.

5626
02:30:11,871 --> 02:30:13,970
That shit was crazy and he hooked it up.

5627
02:30:13,971 --> 02:30:14,180
It.

5628
02:30:14,180 --> 02:30:15,110
That's so cool.

5629
02:30:15,180 --> 02:30:15,600
That's a,

5630
02:30:15,600 --> 02:30:18,050
that's a 15 hour flight Sao Paolo.

5631
02:30:18,051 --> 02:30:19,850
La Direct business class,

5632
02:30:19,851 --> 02:30:20,684
that was huge.

5633
02:30:21,350 --> 02:30:23,330
That was huge for the Rhonda fight.

5634
02:30:23,360 --> 02:30:25,070
I flew Rio to Sao Paulo,

5635
02:30:25,071 --> 02:30:26,000
Sao Paulo.

5636
02:30:26,240 --> 02:30:26,960
One way.

5637
02:30:26,960 --> 02:30:29,030
There's no one direct route from rail.

5638
02:30:29,070 --> 02:30:29,900
No,

5639
02:30:29,900 --> 02:30:30,051
no.

5640
02:30:30,051 --> 02:30:31,130
Direct flight to Rio.

5641
02:30:31,131 --> 02:30:34,070
You fly to Miami and then
you fly to Rio or Atlanta.

5642
02:30:34,071 --> 02:30:34,731
You fly.

5643
02:30:34,731 --> 02:30:34,971
Yeah,

5644
02:30:34,971 --> 02:30:36,260
if I landed a Rio.

5645
02:30:36,920 --> 02:30:37,460
But uh,

5646
02:30:37,460 --> 02:30:39,050
Sao Paulo is a direct flight from La,

5647
02:30:39,080 --> 02:30:40,010
so I just went that way.

5648
02:30:40,490 --> 02:30:43,490
Do I feel like these guys have to
fight each other for the retire right,

5649
02:30:44,620 --> 02:30:45,350
man.

5650
02:30:45,350 --> 02:30:46,183
Good fight.

5651
02:30:46,190 --> 02:30:48,710
This is going to be interested
in such a fucking vet.

5652
02:30:48,860 --> 02:30:50,720
So as Roy Barnett thinks,

5653
02:30:50,750 --> 02:30:51,140
you know,

5654
02:30:51,140 --> 02:30:53,720
that he just has way too many
tools and he fights too smart.

5655
02:30:53,780 --> 02:30:56,180
He thinks that Roy is
just too one dimensional.

5656
02:30:56,780 --> 02:30:57,830
And it's interesting like that.

5657
02:30:57,831 --> 02:31:01,220
His approach to this fight was to
get lean and to watch his diet,

5658
02:31:01,640 --> 02:31:02,090
whereas,

5659
02:31:02,090 --> 02:31:02,870
you know,

5660
02:31:02,870 --> 02:31:06,170
that's like counter completely
counter to how Roy behaves.

5661
02:31:07,150 --> 02:31:08,930
Roy Roy is such an extreme fight,

5662
02:31:08,931 --> 02:31:09,170
man.

5663
02:31:09,170 --> 02:31:09,780
Yeah.

5664
02:31:09,780 --> 02:31:11,320
To hire an entire kitchen king,

5665
02:31:11,660 --> 02:31:13,450
pure fighters to vets.

5666
02:31:13,460 --> 02:31:14,293
Man.

5667
02:31:17,100 --> 02:31:18,210
What was Roy's last fight?

5668
02:31:18,720 --> 02:31:19,080
He,

5669
02:31:19,080 --> 02:31:21,240
his last fight was a fight.

5670
02:31:21,610 --> 02:31:24,000
He got knocked out by Mark Hunt and
then you fight again after that.

5671
02:31:24,030 --> 02:31:25,290
Before that he fought.

5672
02:31:25,291 --> 02:31:25,501
No,

5673
02:31:25,501 --> 02:31:26,190
he hasn't fought.

5674
02:31:26,190 --> 02:31:29,940
Before that he knocked out no Gira and
then before that he lost so he had a

5675
02:31:29,960 --> 02:31:30,793
giant,

5676
02:31:31,050 --> 02:31:32,370
giant victory over Nogueira,

5677
02:31:32,371 --> 02:31:33,270
which was crazy.

5678
02:31:33,271 --> 02:31:33,840
Huge.

5679
02:31:33,840 --> 02:31:35,140
That Abu Dhabi.

5680
02:31:35,370 --> 02:31:36,390
It was terrifying.

5681
02:31:36,560 --> 02:31:36,960
True.

5682
02:31:36,960 --> 02:31:37,793
It was just.

5683
02:31:37,830 --> 02:31:40,730
I never wanted to fight ever
again after terrifying knockout,

5684
02:31:40,740 --> 02:31:45,740
but so then he lost a DC Frank Mir
law got knocked up by Mark Hunt.

5685
02:31:46,350 --> 02:31:47,220
They're not fighting.

5686
02:31:47,670 --> 02:31:50,290
Mark Hunt one exposed
like some holes in it.

5687
02:31:50,291 --> 02:31:53,780
Striking when you know Mark Hunt
is just so slick and experience.

5688
02:31:54,200 --> 02:31:55,620
That's what I'm saying,

5689
02:31:55,621 --> 02:31:56,190
dude.

5690
02:31:56,190 --> 02:31:58,110
You got to be always careful of that shit.

5691
02:31:58,140 --> 02:31:58,501
Come on,

5692
02:31:58,501 --> 02:31:59,334
big boy.

5693
02:31:59,740 --> 02:32:04,400
I got thousand dollars against that
entire mullet in that little hairball.

5694
02:32:04,590 --> 02:32:05,423
Eddie Bravo.

5695
02:32:05,430 --> 02:32:07,530
If you have your $2,000 in the hole,

5696
02:32:07,920 --> 02:32:09,110
you might have to rub his feet.

5697
02:32:09,120 --> 02:32:09,681
Do Somebody.

5698
02:32:09,681 --> 02:32:11,250
My cash is going to keep it rolling.

5699
02:32:13,860 --> 02:32:15,060
Now going back,

5700
02:32:15,070 --> 02:32:18,120
I'm getting a big kick by Barnett,

5701
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:19,833
Josh.

5702
02:32:20,520 --> 02:32:21,840
It's the journey to zero.

5703
02:32:21,860 --> 02:32:23,730
The looking for the team.

5704
02:32:23,790 --> 02:32:24,121
Oh look,

5705
02:32:24,121 --> 02:32:25,050
he's trying to take it down.

5706
02:32:26,880 --> 02:32:27,601
Take some down.

5707
02:32:27,601 --> 02:32:30,650
Just look at these guys grapples.

5708
02:32:31,450 --> 02:32:33,090
Have we ever seen this?

5709
02:32:33,140 --> 02:32:33,660
Roy?

5710
02:32:33,660 --> 02:32:35,210
Roy Nelson taken someone down,

5711
02:32:35,440 --> 02:32:36,273
broke up.

5712
02:32:36,310 --> 02:32:36,650
What?

5713
02:32:36,650 --> 02:32:38,520
Did a work ain't on ultimate fighter.

5714
02:32:38,521 --> 02:32:39,540
He crucified people.

5715
02:32:39,750 --> 02:32:41,820
Roy's got his head against the cage.

5716
02:32:41,940 --> 02:32:42,900
It's heavy on top

5717
02:32:44,510 --> 02:32:45,090
of the fence.

5718
02:32:45,090 --> 02:32:45,370
If,

5719
02:32:45,370 --> 02:32:45,610
if,

5720
02:32:45,610 --> 02:32:46,171
if Josh,

5721
02:32:46,171 --> 02:32:47,190
pardon that gets tapped here,

5722
02:32:47,191 --> 02:32:47,550
you know,

5723
02:32:47,550 --> 02:32:50,790
God damn crazy that he's got the
under hook on the wrong side here.

5724
02:32:51,190 --> 02:32:52,980
It's not as he's got an under.

5725
02:32:53,010 --> 02:32:53,843
It's got to like,

5726
02:32:53,870 --> 02:32:57,410
he's got the insight
under hook on the time.

5727
02:32:57,420 --> 02:32:58,860
Just just smelling his back.

5728
02:32:59,330 --> 02:33:03,180
That's a good keywords
for an arm bar against uh,

5729
02:33:03,580 --> 02:33:04,380
uh,

5730
02:33:04,380 --> 02:33:06,510
Ted Williams that if 10 years ago,

5731
02:33:07,400 --> 02:33:08,240
98

5732
02:33:10,300 --> 02:33:11,133
school man,

5733
02:33:13,460 --> 02:33:14,370
goddammit Ted,

5734
02:33:14,400 --> 02:33:15,900
remember Ted Williams got mad.

5735
02:33:15,900 --> 02:33:17,460
You always talk about
how good the guard is.

5736
02:33:17,820 --> 02:33:17,971
Now.

5737
02:33:17,971 --> 02:33:18,750
Important to guard is,

5738
02:33:18,750 --> 02:33:19,111
oh dude,

5739
02:33:19,111 --> 02:33:21,630
that was an article on truck
doing the garden on me.

5740
02:33:21,900 --> 02:33:22,141
Like,

5741
02:33:22,141 --> 02:33:22,291
well,

5742
02:33:22,291 --> 02:33:24,200
you're not the same size grappling,

5743
02:33:24,410 --> 02:33:25,390
grappling magazine.

5744
02:33:26,770 --> 02:33:28,800
He had an interview and
it said the guard is dead.

5745
02:33:28,860 --> 02:33:29,693
He's the one who started.

5746
02:33:30,990 --> 02:33:31,830
He started the garden.

5747
02:33:31,831 --> 02:33:34,670
He needs a row at Verdugo and
then revise that statement.

5748
02:33:35,160 --> 02:33:39,780
I'm sure it doesn't feel that or no
revising statements from 15 years ago.

5749
02:33:39,960 --> 02:33:42,090
A lot of people had some
ideas about what didn't work.

5750
02:33:42,500 --> 02:33:43,570
Dot Spinning kicks,

5751
02:33:44,550 --> 02:33:46,680
head kicks would never work
and just like most people,

5752
02:33:46,830 --> 02:33:47,760
most of them see fans,

5753
02:33:48,090 --> 02:33:48,630
head kicks,

5754
02:33:48,630 --> 02:33:53,130
only working in movies and Ted Williams
is right when he saw the state of the

5755
02:33:53,131 --> 02:33:56,610
guard that was in gladiator
competent or king of the cage.

5756
02:33:56,611 --> 02:33:59,040
And you weren't seeing
the best of the best.

5757
02:33:59,310 --> 02:33:59,601
Well you,

5758
02:33:59,601 --> 02:34:02,860
you'd have to be like almost at
the Jujitsu competitions or in,

5759
02:34:02,890 --> 02:34:03,790
in the labs,

5760
02:34:04,030 --> 02:34:08,670
like why are they still
rare to see a guard pass?

5761
02:34:10,280 --> 02:34:11,430
Why are they standing?

5762
02:34:11,440 --> 02:34:12,540
That's pure shit.

5763
02:34:12,600 --> 02:34:13,433
What is that?

5764
02:34:13,980 --> 02:34:14,720
Oh,

5765
02:34:14,720 --> 02:34:15,450
keep talking to Brian.

5766
02:34:15,450 --> 02:34:16,800
I keep throwing that left kick.

5767
02:34:17,530 --> 02:34:18,580
They want action,

5768
02:34:18,580 --> 02:34:19,091
Brendan.

5769
02:34:19,091 --> 02:34:19,750
Action.

5770
02:34:19,750 --> 02:34:23,210
It's just pushing them nasty ass please.

5771
02:34:24,520 --> 02:34:25,120
Oh,

5772
02:34:25,120 --> 02:34:26,170
you can't come straight in.

5773
02:34:26,171 --> 02:34:28,870
Line that against fucking
Roy is going to come on Josh.

5774
02:34:29,170 --> 02:34:30,210
Come on Josh.

5775
02:34:30,230 --> 02:34:31,061
Hold Jesus.

5776
02:34:31,061 --> 02:34:31,960
Jesus Christ.

5777
02:34:31,961 --> 02:34:34,990
This is a free to get in
trouble with his right hand.

5778
02:34:35,950 --> 02:34:36,610
John.

5779
02:34:36,610 --> 02:34:36,791
Oh,

5780
02:34:36,791 --> 02:34:37,520
nice opera.

5781
02:34:37,520 --> 02:34:38,720
That fucked Roy up.

5782
02:34:39,360 --> 02:34:40,660
It's got a tremendous team.

5783
02:34:40,661 --> 02:34:41,620
Has He ever been knocked out?

5784
02:34:41,710 --> 02:34:43,390
Mark Hudson walked away.

5785
02:34:43,560 --> 02:34:45,820
Josh Barnett is really pouring it on.

5786
02:34:45,821 --> 02:34:49,240
It's shown some excellent
cardio here on this land.

5787
02:34:49,450 --> 02:34:53,170
That might've been his plan though in
this fight to come and so lean just really

5788
02:34:53,171 --> 02:34:54,910
poor cardio or the pace on them.

5789
02:34:55,240 --> 02:34:57,620
It makes sense if you
want to make a run for it.

5790
02:34:59,200 --> 02:34:59,680
Goodness,

5791
02:34:59,680 --> 02:35:00,410
that hurt.

5792
02:35:00,410 --> 02:35:01,950
Oh God.

5793
02:35:02,530 --> 02:35:03,130
Come on.

5794
02:35:03,130 --> 02:35:05,870
We'll think about if you bring it to zero.

5795
02:35:05,880 --> 02:35:06,101
Okay.

5796
02:35:06,101 --> 02:35:10,760
That sneaky uppercut bar netspend throw
onto Josh was looking for that arm drag.

5797
02:35:10,980 --> 02:35:11,310
Josh,

5798
02:35:11,310 --> 02:35:12,380
you want to make a run at the title?

5799
02:35:12,380 --> 02:35:13,480
He got to cardio man.

5800
02:35:14,740 --> 02:35:15,160
Boom.

5801
02:35:15,160 --> 02:35:15,993
Big Knee.

5802
02:35:16,660 --> 02:35:16,811
Well,

5803
02:35:16,811 --> 02:35:17,261
you know what?

5804
02:35:17,261 --> 02:35:19,720
A man of a loss like
that Travis Brown fight.

5805
02:35:19,960 --> 02:35:20,980
This guy's a warrior,

5806
02:35:20,981 --> 02:35:22,480
you know that lights a fire under a month.

5807
02:35:22,600 --> 02:35:24,490
They said he was fucking pissed.

5808
02:35:24,550 --> 02:35:26,890
Of course he was pissed
when he came on my podcast.

5809
02:35:26,891 --> 02:35:27,760
He was talking about it.

5810
02:35:27,790 --> 02:35:28,570
He's mad about it.

5811
02:35:28,570 --> 02:35:28,751
Yeah,

5812
02:35:28,751 --> 02:35:33,060
well that Travis had done the
film across the next thing.

5813
02:35:33,580 --> 02:35:36,240
He thought that was like super
disrespectful and he said he just,

5814
02:35:36,550 --> 02:35:38,940
he wasn't up for that fight and you know,

5815
02:35:39,070 --> 02:35:39,461
I've heard,

5816
02:35:39,461 --> 02:35:41,950
I've heard all sorts of stories
about Barnett's camp that fight.

5817
02:35:41,951 --> 02:35:43,390
We have a mutual trading
partner and he said,

5818
02:35:43,391 --> 02:35:43,591
pardon?

5819
02:35:43,591 --> 02:35:45,010
It's campus pure shit.

5820
02:35:45,070 --> 02:35:47,500
So he's super upset about that man.

5821
02:35:47,501 --> 02:35:49,840
You know when a guy's been
fighting for that long.

5822
02:35:49,900 --> 02:35:50,011
Yeah.

5823
02:35:50,011 --> 02:35:51,370
One guys been fighting for that long.

5824
02:35:51,580 --> 02:35:53,500
It's probably hard to get
up like that for every camp,

5825
02:35:54,520 --> 02:35:57,300
but it takes him down.

5826
02:35:58,240 --> 02:35:58,750
He's winning.

5827
02:35:58,750 --> 02:36:00,100
This evolved.

5828
02:36:00,700 --> 02:36:01,533
He's evolved.

5829
02:36:02,490 --> 02:36:03,570
He never crashed down.

5830
02:36:03,580 --> 02:36:04,300
We'll never know.

5831
02:36:04,300 --> 02:36:07,680
He knows that it's trying to try and for
that straight arm bar from his back do

5832
02:36:07,681 --> 02:36:11,930
you can tell he lost
this railed roy money.

5833
02:36:12,960 --> 02:36:13,840
This is five rounds.

5834
02:36:13,870 --> 02:36:15,130
Oh Shit.

5835
02:36:15,310 --> 02:36:16,660
Which is bad for Roy.

5836
02:36:17,220 --> 02:36:18,053
One of five.

5837
02:36:18,490 --> 02:36:19,323
Yeah,

5838
02:36:19,950 --> 02:36:20,171
right here.

5839
02:36:20,171 --> 02:36:20,381
Watch.

5840
02:36:20,381 --> 02:36:22,030
He's going to go just to
look at that nice life.

5841
02:36:22,120 --> 02:36:23,470
Oh,

5842
02:36:23,560 --> 02:36:24,281
Henzel Gracie.

5843
02:36:24,281 --> 02:36:25,690
Black belt son.

5844
02:36:25,850 --> 02:36:26,340
Yeah.

5845
02:36:26,340 --> 02:36:26,550
Yeah.

5846
02:36:26,550 --> 02:36:28,240
It's more like laundry room in black,

5847
02:36:28,241 --> 02:36:32,330
but he was with Mark Lehman longer
than will henzel game as well as black.

5848
02:36:32,350 --> 02:36:32,741
But yes,

5849
02:36:32,741 --> 02:36:33,071
you're right.

5850
02:36:33,071 --> 02:36:33,331
You're right.

5851
02:36:33,331 --> 02:36:35,620
So mark claiming he did trade with her.

5852
02:36:36,710 --> 02:36:37,140
I agree.

5853
02:36:37,140 --> 02:36:38,530
Good ground and pound by Roy.

5854
02:36:38,620 --> 02:36:41,410
Good fucking ground and pound from
the half Barnett off his back.

5855
02:36:43,020 --> 02:36:45,740
Interesting that he's able
to take Barnett down one.

5856
02:36:46,070 --> 02:36:48,700
Do you think that like being leaner,

5857
02:36:48,701 --> 02:36:52,630
losing weight makes you a little more
vulnerable takedowns because the guy

5858
02:36:52,631 --> 02:36:54,040
doesn't have to throw
as much weight around.

5859
02:36:54,080 --> 02:36:55,060
Does that make any sense?

5860
02:36:55,090 --> 02:36:57,170
It does kind of make sense
but only a little bit,

5861
02:36:57,180 --> 02:37:01,120
right a little bit because that's why
there's weight divisions and wrestling

5862
02:37:01,500 --> 02:37:05,500
guys can take little guys down easy and
those guys can take bigger deck guys

5863
02:37:05,501 --> 02:37:05,741
down.

5864
02:37:05,741 --> 02:37:06,260
He said,

5865
02:37:06,260 --> 02:37:06,550
I mean,

5866
02:37:06,550 --> 02:37:07,990
how much people are killing themselves.

5867
02:37:07,991 --> 02:37:12,430
The question is like how much of Barnett's
weight loss is like he's lost some

5868
02:37:12,431 --> 02:37:13,420
fat clearly,

5869
02:37:13,421 --> 02:37:13,721
right?

5870
02:37:13,721 --> 02:37:14,920
To get down like 10.

5871
02:37:15,230 --> 02:37:17,070
What do you think is important in college?

5872
02:37:17,240 --> 02:37:22,240
How much lighter is 15
to 30 minutes to 64.

5873
02:37:23,130 --> 02:37:24,470
He lost 25 pounds.

5874
02:37:24,560 --> 02:37:26,680
Really 25 to 65 years.

5875
02:37:26,681 --> 02:37:30,360
Always weighed in for the Travis
Browne fight was actually.

5876
02:37:31,260 --> 02:37:32,093
He was more like,

5877
02:37:32,860 --> 02:37:33,430
yeah,

5878
02:37:33,430 --> 02:37:34,263
about to 65.

5879
02:37:34,380 --> 02:37:35,213
But um,

5880
02:37:35,600 --> 02:37:37,220
so he lost some fat right now.

5881
02:37:37,221 --> 02:37:38,750
How did wrestle in college?

5882
02:37:38,780 --> 02:37:39,530
Josh Barnett?

5883
02:37:39,530 --> 02:37:40,280
Josh.

5884
02:37:40,280 --> 02:37:41,090
I don't think he did.

5885
02:37:41,090 --> 02:37:42,440
I don't think he did.

5886
02:37:42,441 --> 02:37:43,700
It was probably a junior college.

5887
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:44,210
Um,

5888
02:37:44,210 --> 02:37:47,300
so I'm not that shocked that
he's being taken down here.

5889
02:37:47,510 --> 02:37:49,220
It's not like he was a
world class wrestler.

5890
02:37:49,280 --> 02:37:49,450
Dude.

5891
02:37:49,450 --> 02:37:50,480
No one takes josh down.

5892
02:37:50,481 --> 02:37:50,930
Really?

5893
02:37:50,930 --> 02:37:51,681
It's pretty rare.

5894
02:37:51,681 --> 02:37:53,680
But he's a DC to DC.

5895
02:37:54,570 --> 02:37:56,180
I think DC did.

5896
02:37:56,740 --> 02:37:57,510
Oh Shit.

5897
02:37:57,510 --> 02:37:58,343
Oh Shit.

5898
02:37:58,700 --> 02:37:59,533
Oh Shit.

5899
02:38:00,170 --> 02:38:02,700
Throwing haymakers get that money.

5900
02:38:03,230 --> 02:38:04,460
I'll send you a 50 percent buddy.

5901
02:38:04,461 --> 02:38:04,731
Dude.

5902
02:38:04,731 --> 02:38:07,100
Roy Nelson does not look
like he's in bad shape here.

5903
02:38:07,140 --> 02:38:07,550
No,

5904
02:38:07,550 --> 02:38:08,920
don't let that get fool young

5905
02:38:10,980 --> 02:38:12,410
boy to God.

5906
02:38:12,520 --> 02:38:13,040
Dammit.

5907
02:38:13,040 --> 02:38:14,030
Roy has looking at voice,

5908
02:38:14,120 --> 02:38:14,953
throwing kicks.

5909
02:38:15,180 --> 02:38:16,013
He's got some.

5910
02:38:16,580 --> 02:38:18,430
Sun Is hurt.

5911
02:38:18,440 --> 02:38:19,280
Jesus Christ.

5912
02:38:19,281 --> 02:38:20,114
Roy Hits hard.

5913
02:38:20,300 --> 02:38:21,740
Joshua some big ass legs.

5914
02:38:22,690 --> 02:38:23,523
That's how.

5915
02:38:23,890 --> 02:38:28,890
So I got to go even gay because I
would say there's some juicy thighs,

5916
02:38:28,941 --> 02:38:29,840
but a flat ass.

5917
02:38:29,841 --> 02:38:30,890
That's a bad luck on.

5918
02:38:30,920 --> 02:38:31,430
Hm.

5919
02:38:31,430 --> 02:38:32,240
This is interesting.

5920
02:38:32,240 --> 02:38:34,910
I remember hanging out with years ago,

5921
02:38:34,911 --> 02:38:38,690
never ever imagined he
would be a UFC superstar.

5922
02:38:39,110 --> 02:38:40,160
Blocking people out.

5923
02:38:40,170 --> 02:38:40,440
I,

5924
02:38:40,440 --> 02:38:42,860
that's the last thing I
ever would've imagined.

5925
02:38:42,920 --> 02:38:43,131
Dude.

5926
02:38:43,131 --> 02:38:45,610
We had breakfast with him at the,

5927
02:38:45,800 --> 02:38:50,540
the hotel in that little cafe before we
ever had an mma fight and we knew him as

5928
02:38:50,560 --> 02:38:52,160
a Jujitsu guy.

5929
02:38:52,610 --> 02:38:54,230
He was a dude who was
really good at Jujitsu.

5930
02:38:54,760 --> 02:38:56,350
Roy with four fights.

5931
02:38:56,510 --> 02:38:57,680
Oh Jesus.

5932
02:38:58,190 --> 02:38:59,390
He turned into a brawl.

5933
02:39:00,350 --> 02:39:00,920
Ooh,

5934
02:39:00,920 --> 02:39:01,341
good check.

5935
02:39:01,341 --> 02:39:03,650
Hooked by Josh to 48 to 48.

5936
02:39:03,740 --> 02:39:05,630
So he wasn't that much
heavier for that fight.

5937
02:39:05,870 --> 02:39:10,290
He was only nine pounds heavier
for you look like shit man.

5938
02:39:10,640 --> 02:39:12,830
His body looked like she's
put on muscle mass fat,

5939
02:39:12,950 --> 02:39:16,730
but he definitely hasn't lost 25
pounds according to that when at least.

5940
02:39:17,720 --> 02:39:18,560
But he looks good,

5941
02:39:18,561 --> 02:39:18,950
man.

5942
02:39:18,950 --> 02:39:19,970
This is about as good fit.

5943
02:39:20,090 --> 02:39:21,590
He doesn't look week is what I'm saying.

5944
02:39:21,591 --> 02:39:22,850
So you're always taking them down.

5945
02:39:23,090 --> 02:39:25,070
I really don't think
that that's the factor.

5946
02:39:25,160 --> 02:39:28,250
I think it's just Roy is
catching them in transitions.

5947
02:39:28,280 --> 02:39:29,110
Oh Shit.

5948
02:39:29,110 --> 02:39:29,943
Straight left.

5949
02:39:31,970 --> 02:39:32,890
Fuck Bro.

5950
02:39:32,960 --> 02:39:34,490
Barnett boys are trading.

5951
02:39:34,550 --> 02:39:36,560
Barnett also looks like he's been.

5952
02:39:36,680 --> 02:39:38,180
He's been turned it on,

5953
02:39:39,170 --> 02:39:42,780
turned it on in this standup
like that after initial Florida.

5954
02:39:43,540 --> 02:39:45,280
That was very good.

5955
02:39:45,530 --> 02:39:46,640
Beautiful Dude.

5956
02:39:46,650 --> 02:39:49,300
He's fucked up and he's pouring it on him.

5957
02:39:49,460 --> 02:39:51,870
Pull any switching south.

5958
02:39:51,920 --> 02:39:52,760
Paw Barnett's

5959
02:39:54,550 --> 02:39:55,280
Jesus,

5960
02:39:55,280 --> 02:39:56,113
boom.

5961
02:39:56,450 --> 02:39:56,721
Yeah,

5962
02:39:56,721 --> 02:40:01,721
and he's waiting for Roy to get tired
before he pours it on to fighting crafty

5963
02:40:02,311 --> 02:40:05,790
in the beginning part of the Brown and
then he hits around three minutes in.

5964
02:40:05,820 --> 02:40:07,170
He starts really turning it on.

5965
02:40:07,190 --> 02:40:07,961
Veterans Shit.

5966
02:40:07,961 --> 02:40:08,540
Yeah.

5967
02:40:08,540 --> 02:40:08,721
Well,

5968
02:40:08,721 --> 02:40:11,810
he also knows Roy Roy.

5969
02:40:12,120 --> 02:40:12,930
A lot of damage,

5970
02:40:12,930 --> 02:40:13,920
but trying to touch the ground.

5971
02:40:13,950 --> 02:40:15,810
You can't be at your best with that body.

5972
02:40:15,811 --> 02:40:16,644
There's no way.

5973
02:40:18,110 --> 02:40:18,850
Boom.

5974
02:40:18,850 --> 02:40:19,000
Yeah,

5975
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:19,790
there's physically.

5976
02:40:19,790 --> 02:40:20,960
There's just girls like that,

5977
02:40:20,980 --> 02:40:21,340
but.

5978
02:40:21,340 --> 02:40:22,520
But let's go bro.

5979
02:40:22,521 --> 02:40:23,354
Let's say Roy,

5980
02:40:23,420 --> 02:40:26,300
let's say Roy gets down
to 2:20 [inaudible].

5981
02:40:26,510 --> 02:40:27,220
Is he going to be this?

5982
02:40:27,220 --> 02:40:29,900
Is He gave me the same power puncher
or is that right hand go away?

5983
02:40:29,930 --> 02:40:31,240
That's a super good question too.

5984
02:40:31,241 --> 02:40:31,760
Shit.

5985
02:40:31,760 --> 02:40:32,481
No one could know,

5986
02:40:32,481 --> 02:40:32,721
right?

5987
02:40:32,721 --> 02:40:34,850
You don't know until he tries
it and he's never tried it.

5988
02:40:35,330 --> 02:40:35,541
I mean,

5989
02:40:35,541 --> 02:40:35,641
we,

5990
02:40:35,641 --> 02:40:37,190
we might see a better roy than ever.

5991
02:40:37,191 --> 02:40:37,911
Jesus Christ.

5992
02:40:37,911 --> 02:40:38,870
Josh is looking good.

5993
02:40:39,410 --> 02:40:41,600
He's relentless here with
his standard is bleeding.

5994
02:40:42,070 --> 02:40:42,800
It's Josh.

5995
02:40:42,800 --> 02:40:47,800
His nose on a shoulder in agony
means taking some big breaths.

5996
02:40:49,340 --> 02:40:51,230
Josh keeps hitting that solar plexus to.

5997
02:40:51,350 --> 02:40:54,860
Did you know when Josh would have a
stitch corner on which this hurts?

5998
02:40:54,861 --> 02:40:55,370
I'm for sure not.

5999
02:40:55,370 --> 02:40:55,881
Haven't stitched.

6000
02:40:55,881 --> 02:40:58,280
Because you still only fight
with stitch before we went.

6001
02:40:58,281 --> 02:40:58,990
Knocked on detail.

6002
02:40:58,990 --> 02:40:59,361
Stitch.

6003
02:40:59,361 --> 02:41:00,230
Let me die in there.

6004
02:41:01,030 --> 02:41:02,510
I still stitch the opposite.

6005
02:41:02,511 --> 02:41:03,230
Don't let me die.

6006
02:41:03,230 --> 02:41:04,063
And

6007
02:41:05,590 --> 02:41:06,540
I'd say stitch.

6008
02:41:06,590 --> 02:41:07,191
Look at me Bro.

6009
02:41:07,191 --> 02:41:08,150
Don't let me fucking die.

6010
02:41:08,151 --> 02:41:10,940
And there josh say the exact opposite.

6011
02:41:11,050 --> 02:41:11,420
Correct?

6012
02:41:11,420 --> 02:41:12,021
I remember thinking,

6013
02:41:12,021 --> 02:41:12,621
God damn,

6014
02:41:12,621 --> 02:41:13,310
that's gangster.

6015
02:41:13,310 --> 02:41:13,671
What's that?

6016
02:41:13,671 --> 02:41:15,110
Jamie was to 65 that fight.

6017
02:41:15,200 --> 02:41:15,501
Oh,

6018
02:41:15,501 --> 02:41:16,030
okay.

6019
02:41:16,030 --> 02:41:16,880
So boom.

6020
02:41:16,910 --> 02:41:17,990
So it was incorrect.

6021
02:41:18,140 --> 02:41:18,973
We're giving you a pallet.

6022
02:41:19,280 --> 02:41:19,461
Yeah,

6023
02:41:19,461 --> 02:41:20,360
you're 100 percent right.

6024
02:41:20,361 --> 02:41:22,040
Then that's 100 percent right?

6025
02:41:23,580 --> 02:41:24,091
More so.

6026
02:41:24,091 --> 02:41:24,924
Right.

6027
02:41:26,210 --> 02:41:26,840
Damn,

6028
02:41:26,840 --> 02:41:27,710
this is nasty.

6029
02:41:31,480 --> 02:41:32,180
It can be inserted.

6030
02:41:32,180 --> 02:41:33,340
This thing goes off five.

6031
02:41:34,210 --> 02:41:35,043
There's no way.

6032
02:41:35,110 --> 02:41:35,943
Damn.

6033
02:41:36,310 --> 02:41:37,960
I think it was a 26 pounds,

6034
02:41:37,961 --> 02:41:38,260
right?

6035
02:41:38,260 --> 02:41:39,260
And they said,

6036
02:41:39,300 --> 02:41:39,740
nope,

6037
02:41:39,740 --> 02:41:40,720
just 2:39.

6038
02:41:40,721 --> 02:41:41,920
So he lost 26 pounds.

6039
02:41:42,130 --> 02:41:42,911
That's insane.

6040
02:41:42,911 --> 02:41:44,080
Talking about dedication.

6041
02:41:44,320 --> 02:41:46,080
That elbow data.

6042
02:41:46,440 --> 02:41:48,490
Josh has mad that Reebok didn't make it.

6043
02:41:48,491 --> 02:41:49,540
Speedo Reebok.

6044
02:41:51,010 --> 02:41:52,150
Dennis hallman's pissed.

6045
02:41:53,080 --> 02:41:53,351
Oh yeah.

6046
02:41:53,351 --> 02:41:53,651
Josh,

6047
02:41:53,651 --> 02:41:54,610
you still is fighting those.

6048
02:41:54,880 --> 02:41:55,331
Boom.

6049
02:41:55,331 --> 02:41:56,320
There's that one again.

6050
02:41:56,440 --> 02:41:57,241
Oh Man.

6051
02:41:57,241 --> 02:41:58,300
His clenches nasty.

6052
02:41:58,301 --> 02:41:59,134
This fight.

6053
02:41:59,410 --> 02:42:01,870
I don't see how much
hell Roy Roy has done.

6054
02:42:02,050 --> 02:42:03,770
He is tight as possible.

6055
02:42:04,680 --> 02:42:05,790
That's not possible.

6056
02:42:07,850 --> 02:42:08,683
Crazy.

6057
02:42:10,700 --> 02:42:10,990
Oh,

6058
02:42:10,990 --> 02:42:15,400
and Josh comes back as he's playing
possum and he throws a head.

6059
02:42:17,320 --> 02:42:20,950
Fucking saw that head kick and rock them.

6060
02:42:20,951 --> 02:42:22,480
But then Barnett rock them back.

6061
02:42:22,510 --> 02:42:23,440
Is that his first head kick?

6062
02:42:23,441 --> 02:42:24,010
However,

6063
02:42:24,010 --> 02:42:25,360
I would assume so.

6064
02:42:25,540 --> 02:42:26,710
Especially in the UFC.

6065
02:42:27,190 --> 02:42:29,320
That was some straight panda bear shit,

6066
02:42:29,330 --> 02:42:29,840
man.

6067
02:42:29,840 --> 02:42:31,630
That tattoo he has on his shoulder,

6068
02:42:31,660 --> 02:42:32,141
that's his,

6069
02:42:32,141 --> 02:42:32,470
uh,

6070
02:42:32,470 --> 02:42:32,830
his.

6071
02:42:32,830 --> 02:42:33,760
He had a shirt,

6072
02:42:33,850 --> 02:42:37,570
a apparel line back when he was
like a purple belt in Jujitsu.

6073
02:42:37,600 --> 02:42:37,831
Eight.

6074
02:42:37,831 --> 02:42:37,981
Oh,

6075
02:42:37,981 --> 02:42:39,790
eight or something like
that or stuff like that.

6076
02:42:39,791 --> 02:42:40,390
That was like,

6077
02:42:40,390 --> 02:42:41,560
he was gonna make his money that way.

6078
02:42:42,290 --> 02:42:44,200
The skins.

6079
02:42:44,350 --> 02:42:48,160
He had dragon skins once that
member that they're the rash guards.

6080
02:42:48,161 --> 02:42:50,620
He had like a really good
brand of rash guards.

6081
02:42:50,710 --> 02:42:52,270
That was his.

6082
02:42:53,050 --> 02:42:53,741
I think that's it.

6083
02:42:53,741 --> 02:42:54,520
I think that's the local.

6084
02:42:54,520 --> 02:42:55,620
I think that's it because I,

6085
02:42:55,621 --> 02:42:57,290
I used to tell him he shot too.

6086
02:42:57,520 --> 02:42:58,840
He sent them to me once.

6087
02:42:59,010 --> 02:43:00,550
You had like the best rash card.

6088
02:43:00,551 --> 02:43:00,990
Really?

6089
02:43:00,990 --> 02:43:01,420
Yeah.

6090
02:43:01,420 --> 02:43:02,253
Just stopped doing them.

6091
02:43:02,380 --> 02:43:03,280
I don't know man.

6092
02:43:03,281 --> 02:43:03,491
You know,

6093
02:43:03,491 --> 02:43:04,324
that's a good question.

6094
02:43:04,450 --> 02:43:09,190
But he had rash cars was like a really
good material that like wick sweat away

6095
02:43:09,191 --> 02:43:09,850
from you.

6096
02:43:09,850 --> 02:43:11,420
They were really good rash guards.

6097
02:43:11,640 --> 02:43:12,190
Roy's always

6098
02:43:12,190 --> 02:43:13,240
been a smart guy,

6099
02:43:13,241 --> 02:43:14,074
man.

6100
02:43:14,120 --> 02:43:17,020
He's always been on the
outside of this tough texture.

6101
02:43:17,021 --> 02:43:17,830
It was soft,

6102
02:43:17,830 --> 02:43:19,120
but it was a tough texture.

6103
02:43:19,270 --> 02:43:21,900
And the idea I think was that it
was really good for grappling.

6104
02:43:21,901 --> 02:43:23,300
[inaudible] wouldn't tear as easy as like,

6105
02:43:23,340 --> 02:43:24,910
it's cool a regular rash guard,

6106
02:43:24,911 --> 02:43:25,990
which has meant for surfing,

6107
02:43:26,300 --> 02:43:26,710
you know?

6108
02:43:26,710 --> 02:43:27,543
That's cool.

6109
02:43:27,550 --> 02:43:27,731
Yeah.

6110
02:43:27,731 --> 02:43:30,760
He's always been kind of the
smart guy doing different shit.

6111
02:43:30,790 --> 02:43:32,800
He's always gone against the grain always.

6112
02:43:32,960 --> 02:43:33,850
That's been ryman.

6113
02:43:33,910 --> 02:43:36,310
So what happens now
after that second round,

6114
02:43:36,311 --> 02:43:37,420
that second round was crazy.

6115
02:43:38,650 --> 02:43:39,490
It's one one.

6116
02:43:39,810 --> 02:43:40,060
Yeah.

6117
02:43:40,060 --> 02:43:40,750
But I.

6118
02:43:40,750 --> 02:43:40,991
There's no way.

6119
02:43:40,991 --> 02:43:41,830
This goes all five.

6120
02:43:41,831 --> 02:43:45,850
I think Burnett for boy hits him
with one of those fucking head kicks.

6121
02:43:47,110 --> 02:43:48,260
What are we talking about?

6122
02:43:49,560 --> 02:43:53,200
If Roy landed that head kick
and Barnett toes curled.

6123
02:43:53,210 --> 02:43:54,610
So we'd be like,

6124
02:43:54,611 --> 02:43:55,061
what?

6125
02:43:55,061 --> 02:43:57,160
In the greatest knockout
in heavyweight history.

6126
02:43:57,640 --> 02:43:58,091
Here we go,

6127
02:43:58,091 --> 02:43:58,631
round three,

6128
02:43:58,631 --> 02:43:59,464
man.

6129
02:44:00,610 --> 02:44:01,350
Fuck man.

6130
02:44:01,350 --> 02:44:03,580
Both these guys are so
fucking mentally tough.

6131
02:44:03,610 --> 02:44:05,320
You're not breaking either one of these.

6132
02:44:05,710 --> 02:44:06,790
Nice uppercut and he kicked me,

6133
02:44:06,791 --> 02:44:06,940
you know,

6134
02:44:06,940 --> 02:44:10,660
it's almost like Roy has to empty the
gas tank early because he's got to try to

6135
02:44:10,661 --> 02:44:11,231
hurt Josh.

6136
02:44:11,231 --> 02:44:11,531
Wally.

6137
02:44:11,531 --> 02:44:12,364
Ken Too.

6138
02:44:12,790 --> 02:44:14,020
Those take downs or fresh.

6139
02:44:14,050 --> 02:44:16,930
He keeps get them down like
this with a body of was trips.

6140
02:44:17,150 --> 02:44:17,983
Oh,

6141
02:44:18,220 --> 02:44:19,480
those knees are nasty.

6142
02:44:19,540 --> 02:44:21,940
Barnett's layman attempting
to take him down.

6143
02:44:21,941 --> 02:44:22,870
I think that's interesting.

6144
02:44:22,960 --> 02:44:25,300
It is with Barnett's Fao heavy is on top.

6145
02:44:25,330 --> 02:44:28,960
While I think once a roy got on
top of him to in that first round,

6146
02:44:28,961 --> 02:44:29,651
that was no fun.

6147
02:44:29,651 --> 02:44:29,801
No.

6148
02:44:29,801 --> 02:44:30,101
He said,

6149
02:44:30,101 --> 02:44:30,401
you know what?

6150
02:44:30,401 --> 02:44:31,160
Fuck this.

6151
02:44:31,160 --> 02:44:32,740
Roy's kind of respected game.

6152
02:44:32,770 --> 02:44:33,001
His,

6153
02:44:33,001 --> 02:44:33,834
his GRANDPA,

6154
02:44:34,570 --> 02:44:36,580
although we don't see it
very often in his fights,

6155
02:44:36,600 --> 02:44:36,880
it's.

6156
02:44:36,880 --> 02:44:37,990
It's very high level.

6157
02:44:38,020 --> 02:44:38,853
Everybody knows it.

6158
02:44:38,920 --> 02:44:40,030
He's strong as fuck.

6159
02:44:40,360 --> 02:44:41,193
He's no joke.

6160
02:44:41,920 --> 02:44:43,900
These are good knees
inside of the leg here.

6161
02:44:43,930 --> 02:44:45,130
I'm more impressed with Barnett.

6162
02:44:45,131 --> 02:44:45,581
Stand up.

6163
02:44:45,581 --> 02:44:47,470
How far it's come along in the clench.

6164
02:44:47,670 --> 02:44:48,310
Can tell he's working.

6165
02:44:48,310 --> 02:44:49,060
I'm only tie.

6166
02:44:49,060 --> 02:44:50,520
He does a lot of crazy shit to like.

6167
02:44:50,560 --> 02:44:52,210
Josh does savant and stuff like that.

6168
02:44:52,250 --> 02:44:53,860
He has like a savant trainer.

6169
02:44:53,890 --> 02:44:54,760
He's an interesting dude,

6170
02:44:54,761 --> 02:44:55,540
man.

6171
02:44:55,540 --> 02:44:56,291
Very smart guy.

6172
02:44:56,291 --> 02:44:56,620
Man.

6173
02:44:56,620 --> 02:45:00,430
Are you for or against male UFC
fighters and wearing rash guards?

6174
02:45:04,450 --> 02:45:05,283
Will they let

6175
02:45:06,460 --> 02:45:07,990
they let the women would
have guys wanted to.

6176
02:45:08,050 --> 02:45:09,160
Where would you be against that?

6177
02:45:09,430 --> 02:45:11,890
It's kind of girls wear
long sleeve though.

6178
02:45:12,730 --> 02:45:14,440
I don't know a rash guards.

6179
02:45:14,500 --> 02:45:15,310
Right,

6180
02:45:15,310 --> 02:45:17,170
but would you be happy with just chest?

6181
02:45:17,171 --> 02:45:17,441
I would.

6182
02:45:17,441 --> 02:45:22,090
I mean I would think rash guards would
mean like greasing obviously an MMA

6183
02:45:22,190 --> 02:45:23,950
pepperoni or accusing.

6184
02:45:24,130 --> 02:45:25,660
Anytime a fighter.

6185
02:45:25,830 --> 02:45:28,360
It's going to fight some guy
that's known for Jujitsu.

6186
02:45:28,570 --> 02:45:29,830
If he doesn't grease up,

6187
02:45:29,950 --> 02:45:31,000
nobody's checking.

6188
02:45:31,380 --> 02:45:32,480
He'd be in a check now.

6189
02:45:33,010 --> 02:45:33,843
How do they check?

6190
02:45:34,590 --> 02:45:35,480
You get patted down.

6191
02:45:35,530 --> 02:45:36,140
What happens?

6192
02:45:36,140 --> 02:45:36,820
Here's the test.

6193
02:45:36,820 --> 02:45:37,653
Look at this.

6194
02:45:37,660 --> 02:45:39,520
Separated in separately to clench

6195
02:45:43,150 --> 02:45:43,421
down,

6196
02:45:43,421 --> 02:45:44,254
Bro.

6197
02:45:44,300 --> 02:45:45,440
That doesn't mean nothing.

6198
02:45:45,760 --> 02:45:46,541
Can't do anything.

6199
02:45:46,541 --> 02:45:51,260
If they give you a mineral oil bath
the night before and then they wash oil

6200
02:45:51,520 --> 02:45:52,770
still there and no one's ever been.

6201
02:45:53,410 --> 02:45:56,350
The only way to really do it would be
like after a fight they'd be a guy that's

6202
02:45:56,351 --> 02:45:59,710
assigned to that take the swab and
doesn't like that across your back.

6203
02:45:59,800 --> 02:46:01,060
I don't think it's an epidemic.

6204
02:46:01,061 --> 02:46:02,560
I don't think it's like a huge issue.

6205
02:46:02,650 --> 02:46:03,483
I think

6206
02:46:05,350 --> 02:46:07,030
people are always complaining that people,

6207
02:46:07,031 --> 02:46:10,160
if you're going to fight a guy
who's in St submission guy and

6208
02:46:10,160 --> 02:46:13,280
you know that you could take a mineral
oil bath the night before and take a

6209
02:46:13,281 --> 02:46:17,300
shower and soap up the day after and it
will still have an effect that won't be

6210
02:46:17,301 --> 02:46:21,950
measurable because like people are
smoother and slicker after they do that.

6211
02:46:21,980 --> 02:46:23,270
Even after they take a shower.

6212
02:46:25,700 --> 02:46:29,270
When you play vaseline on fighters
eyes that she gets all over the body,

6213
02:46:29,620 --> 02:46:30,440
touched the face,

6214
02:46:30,440 --> 02:46:31,040
grappling,

6215
02:46:31,040 --> 02:46:31,910
it gets on their back.

6216
02:46:31,970 --> 02:46:35,030
They all of a sudden the guy's full
filled up with vaseline for sure.

6217
02:46:35,090 --> 02:46:38,090
Well remember when Anderson Silva wiped
it off his face and wiped it on his

6218
02:46:38,091 --> 02:46:39,410
shoulders and his chest.

6219
02:46:39,800 --> 02:46:40,250
You know,

6220
02:46:40,250 --> 02:46:41,170
Clay Gregan choke.

6221
02:46:41,180 --> 02:46:42,360
His brother slap it on.

6222
02:46:42,710 --> 02:46:43,401
When he slap him,

6223
02:46:43,401 --> 02:46:43,871
he got in trouble.

6224
02:46:43,871 --> 02:46:44,870
We can't slap them anymore.

6225
02:46:44,900 --> 02:46:45,733
Yeah.

6226
02:46:46,100 --> 02:46:47,930
Is I think they should let fighters.

6227
02:46:47,931 --> 02:46:51,460
Were Reebok rash guards know
how much money reebok with nick.

6228
02:46:52,120 --> 02:46:54,380
I don't think they'd make any more money
than they're making with these shorts.

6229
02:46:54,400 --> 02:46:54,591
You know,

6230
02:46:54,591 --> 02:46:57,380
the fighters that I couldn't make
reebok rash guards wouldn't be huge.

6231
02:46:57,381 --> 02:46:59,210
I don't know that in touch that market,

6232
02:46:59,300 --> 02:47:04,300
whereas when Pat Miletich fought
Carlos Newton and Jeremy Horn like a,

6233
02:47:06,320 --> 02:47:06,870
I think,

6234
02:47:06,870 --> 02:47:11,870
I think it was that fight where he puts
vaseline on on Pat's neck was one of the

6235
02:47:12,591 --> 02:47:13,380
fights where he put it out.

6236
02:47:13,380 --> 02:47:16,810
There was like a miscommunication
and a bad idea to stanley.

6237
02:47:17,050 --> 02:47:18,740
Maybe a Jeremy fucked up.

6238
02:47:18,741 --> 02:47:19,461
I don't know who fucked up,

6239
02:47:19,461 --> 02:47:23,240
but there was somehow maybe Jeremy
thought that Pat said put it on my neck.

6240
02:47:23,241 --> 02:47:24,350
I don't remember the details.

6241
02:47:24,530 --> 02:47:25,011
Oh Shit.

6242
02:47:25,011 --> 02:47:25,311
This fight.

6243
02:47:25,311 --> 02:47:26,080
It's crazy.

6244
02:47:26,080 --> 02:47:26,913
Running us her.

6245
02:47:26,960 --> 02:47:29,420
He just took a big deep
breath looking for the single.

6246
02:47:29,950 --> 02:47:30,540
Oh,

6247
02:47:30,540 --> 02:47:32,540
if he gets them down another single leg,

6248
02:47:34,680 --> 02:47:35,960
look at this Roy Nelson.

6249
02:47:36,200 --> 02:47:37,400
Snap that leg straight.

6250
02:47:37,430 --> 02:47:39,170
That's exhausting for Roy by the way.

6251
02:47:39,520 --> 02:47:40,190
Yup.

6252
02:47:40,190 --> 02:47:43,850
But is it more exhausting than standing
up and dealing with a barrage of strikes

6253
02:47:43,851 --> 02:47:45,440
that just keeps putting on him?

6254
02:47:46,340 --> 02:47:47,930
What kind of testing did they do in Japan?

6255
02:47:48,590 --> 02:47:49,550
So great point.

6256
02:47:50,330 --> 02:47:51,163
UFC tests.

6257
02:47:52,390 --> 02:47:54,020
Is the u s Ada doing it?

6258
02:47:54,590 --> 02:47:57,320
Who's doing it well are well.

6259
02:47:57,380 --> 02:47:59,600
Aren't the UFC fighters
all tested randomly?

6260
02:47:59,601 --> 02:47:59,960
No.

6261
02:47:59,960 --> 02:48:00,561
That's what I think.

6262
02:48:00,561 --> 02:48:00,741
Right,

6263
02:48:00,741 --> 02:48:01,100
but.

6264
02:48:01,100 --> 02:48:01,590
But you got to,

6265
02:48:01,590 --> 02:48:05,270
it's September third is you have to fill
out this sheet where you've got to give

6266
02:48:05,271 --> 02:48:06,320
them your location,

6267
02:48:06,321 --> 02:48:07,154
your whereabouts,

6268
02:48:07,220 --> 02:48:09,080
so they can come get you at anytime.

6269
02:48:09,410 --> 02:48:10,243
Right?

6270
02:48:10,650 --> 02:48:11,483
Um,

6271
02:48:11,920 --> 02:48:12,753
but like,

6272
02:48:13,010 --> 02:48:13,820
what is a,

6273
02:48:13,820 --> 02:48:15,810
I wonder how they're getting
tested after this fight,

6274
02:48:16,620 --> 02:48:18,650
not doing roids anymore because of this,

6275
02:48:18,651 --> 02:48:20,070
that you think they're
scared and they're like,

6276
02:48:20,290 --> 02:48:21,380
or what are they doing?

6277
02:48:21,560 --> 02:48:22,393
What do you think?

6278
02:48:22,790 --> 02:48:23,210
Shit,

6279
02:48:23,210 --> 02:48:26,510
what do you take them to get around this?

6280
02:48:26,570 --> 02:48:28,530
These new testing schedules?

6281
02:48:30,140 --> 02:48:32,180
Some of them for sure are
going to stop doing it.

6282
02:48:32,530 --> 02:48:33,560
Some are 100 percent.

6283
02:48:33,561 --> 02:48:33,960
So,

6284
02:48:33,960 --> 02:48:34,250
you know,

6285
02:48:34,250 --> 02:48:35,210
it's always an issue though.

6286
02:48:35,210 --> 02:48:36,770
Wicki said that was pretty interesting.

6287
02:48:36,980 --> 02:48:40,880
He said they figured out a way to
make testosterone from animals that's

6288
02:48:40,881 --> 02:48:41,840
undetectable.

6289
02:48:42,070 --> 02:48:44,360
Like now they can tell if it,

6290
02:48:44,361 --> 02:48:44,710
uh,

6291
02:48:44,710 --> 02:48:48,800
they make it from yams to
make it from some wild Yam.

6292
02:48:48,801 --> 02:48:50,090
I don't know how the fuck they make.

6293
02:48:50,091 --> 02:48:55,091
And I was talking about micro dosing
to kick to the body boom to the head.

6294
02:48:55,670 --> 02:48:56,503
Oh Shit.

6295
02:48:57,030 --> 02:48:57,220
What?

6296
02:48:57,220 --> 02:48:59,840
The Bolo Punches God damn.

6297
02:48:59,841 --> 02:49:00,674
What a fight.

6298
02:49:00,810 --> 02:49:01,161
What was that?

6299
02:49:01,161 --> 02:49:01,960
Around three?

6300
02:49:01,960 --> 02:49:02,793
That was around three.

6301
02:49:02,900 --> 02:49:03,470
Yeah.

6302
02:49:03,470 --> 02:49:03,711
Yeah.

6303
02:49:03,711 --> 02:49:04,071
So,

6304
02:49:04,071 --> 02:49:04,550
uh,

6305
02:49:04,550 --> 02:49:04,761
yeah,

6306
02:49:04,761 --> 02:49:05,840
he was talking about microdosing,

6307
02:49:05,900 --> 02:49:08,010
but he was also talking about a new form

6308
02:49:08,010 --> 02:49:12,510
of testosterone that they've been able
to do that they make out of animals.

6309
02:49:12,760 --> 02:49:17,190
I guess the test before could show
that it didn't come from an animal,

6310
02:49:17,340 --> 02:49:21,330
that it came from some plant plant form.

6311
02:49:21,810 --> 02:49:22,351
The way they,

6312
02:49:22,351 --> 02:49:22,531
uh,

6313
02:49:22,531 --> 02:49:23,364
they create it.

6314
02:49:23,370 --> 02:49:24,890
So now apparently they're there.

6315
02:49:24,891 --> 02:49:25,880
They're able to do that.

6316
02:49:26,440 --> 02:49:28,950
We were also talking
about the Tour de France.

6317
02:49:29,430 --> 02:49:29,970
What's so funny,

6318
02:49:29,970 --> 02:49:30,803
we laugh.

6319
02:49:30,810 --> 02:49:34,950
They had that band Europe
taking the final countdown.

6320
02:49:36,310 --> 02:49:39,720
I can just imagine like their manager
calling them and then say we've got some

6321
02:49:39,721 --> 02:49:40,554
good news,

6322
02:49:43,530 --> 02:49:44,610
national commercial,

6323
02:49:44,930 --> 02:49:45,763
good news.

6324
02:49:45,960 --> 02:49:47,610
The bad news is going to make fun of you.

6325
02:49:49,460 --> 02:49:51,480
They don't give a microwave.

6326
02:49:51,481 --> 02:49:52,820
Probably didn't know the managers.

6327
02:49:52,830 --> 02:49:54,210
They don't tell them until I get that.

6328
02:49:54,330 --> 02:49:57,660
And then they did in the middle of the
commercial shoot and they kind of figured

6329
02:49:57,661 --> 02:49:57,961
it out.

6330
02:49:57,961 --> 02:49:58,794
Oh Shit.

6331
02:49:58,890 --> 02:49:59,723
They're goofing on.

6332
02:50:00,170 --> 02:50:03,660
You think they give a fuck dumb shit.

6333
02:50:03,661 --> 02:50:05,000
But it's still their song.

6334
02:50:05,001 --> 02:50:05,160
I mean,

6335
02:50:05,160 --> 02:50:05,841
they're still doing it.

6336
02:50:05,841 --> 02:50:07,290
It's not like national campaign.

6337
02:50:07,800 --> 02:50:10,230
Here we go round for
a championship rounds.

6338
02:50:10,680 --> 02:50:14,400
What do you think that this is actually
fought in a pretty fucking good pace.

6339
02:50:14,760 --> 02:50:16,200
Barnett with a high kick man.

6340
02:50:16,260 --> 02:50:16,530
Oh,

6341
02:50:16,530 --> 02:50:17,650
look at the body chapter.

6342
02:50:17,940 --> 02:50:18,780
Still got gas.

6343
02:50:18,781 --> 02:50:19,614
Look at him

6344
02:50:19,830 --> 02:50:20,700
pouring it onto

6345
02:50:22,470 --> 02:50:24,650
Barnett up three to one,

6346
02:50:25,630 --> 02:50:26,463
two to one.

6347
02:50:26,790 --> 02:50:31,500
If I was really absolutely
doing practicing bitch,

6348
02:50:31,680 --> 02:50:33,750
I'm going to tagged back to zero.

6349
02:50:33,751 --> 02:50:35,910
I to zero as soon as it's over.

6350
02:50:36,030 --> 02:50:37,560
But when you think about the first round,

6351
02:50:37,750 --> 02:50:40,140
didn't Barnett do way
more damage on the feet.

6352
02:50:40,520 --> 02:50:42,230
Taken down twice and dominated.

6353
02:50:43,030 --> 02:50:45,750
Didn't Barnett do more damage
on the feet and he did it,

6354
02:50:45,780 --> 02:50:46,613
but it doesn't.

6355
02:50:46,700 --> 02:50:47,533
Does it?

6356
02:50:47,720 --> 02:50:48,200
No,

6357
02:50:48,200 --> 02:50:50,100
but it shouldn't matter.

6358
02:50:50,370 --> 02:50:51,203
Shouldn't matter.

6359
02:50:51,270 --> 02:50:52,860
Like who got hurt more
in that first round?

6360
02:50:52,861 --> 02:50:53,850
I would say roy did.

6361
02:50:54,150 --> 02:50:56,190
I would say Josh did
more damage standing up.

6362
02:50:57,070 --> 02:50:57,903
Oh

6363
02:50:59,470 --> 02:51:00,303
Man.

6364
02:51:00,450 --> 02:51:01,283
And a

6365
02:51:03,370 --> 02:51:04,090
great job.

6366
02:51:04,090 --> 02:51:05,290
If he didn't decide to go,

6367
02:51:05,500 --> 02:51:06,370
go for it right there.

6368
02:51:06,371 --> 02:51:07,360
He would've been on his back.

6369
02:51:07,690 --> 02:51:09,160
That was a fucking great guy.

6370
02:51:09,520 --> 02:51:10,271
Quick decision.

6371
02:51:10,271 --> 02:51:11,770
You got to keep going with that wizard.

6372
02:51:11,950 --> 02:51:12,783
Pam,

6373
02:51:13,150 --> 02:51:13,781
Josh Barnett.

6374
02:51:13,781 --> 02:51:18,020
It's just he's in better shape in this
fight that I've seen him in a deal about

6375
02:51:18,060 --> 02:51:20,470
someone stomping on your feet as
a dirty or is it part of the game

6376
02:51:20,710 --> 02:51:21,790
fighting part of the game?

6377
02:51:21,880 --> 02:51:22,713
No,

6378
02:51:23,590 --> 02:51:28,330
Josh Barnett tying his arm out punches
to the body needs the body butter that

6379
02:51:28,560 --> 02:51:28,930
bright,

6380
02:51:28,930 --> 02:51:30,220
that entire bag of mangoes.

6381
02:51:30,280 --> 02:51:31,150
They're so good.

6382
02:51:31,200 --> 02:51:32,033
They're delicious.

6383
02:51:32,050 --> 02:51:33,940
Some of the best snack food ever.

6384
02:51:34,210 --> 02:51:35,510
Whoever figured out how to do that shit.

6385
02:51:35,511 --> 02:51:36,610
It was Jean Mexicans.

6386
02:51:36,910 --> 02:51:37,151
I know.

6387
02:51:37,151 --> 02:51:39,140
I put that online and that's
all Mexicans kept saying,

6388
02:51:39,160 --> 02:51:39,993
okay,

6389
02:51:40,370 --> 02:51:41,490
he's Mexican.

6390
02:51:41,491 --> 02:51:43,320
We invented a lot of shit
that we didn't get credit for.

6391
02:51:43,321 --> 02:51:44,550
All that Nwa Shit.

6392
02:51:44,551 --> 02:51:48,120
That's all Mexican low riders
and Paula's the fucking outfits.

6393
02:51:48,170 --> 02:51:49,300
Stroke at all.

6394
02:51:49,330 --> 02:51:50,190
Oh Shit.

6395
02:51:51,730 --> 02:51:52,450
It's true.

6396
02:51:52,450 --> 02:51:52,710
Still.

6397
02:51:52,710 --> 02:51:53,750
People make fun of us.

6398
02:51:54,170 --> 02:51:54,590
Well,

6399
02:51:54,590 --> 02:51:57,020
it's just because we're
so close to gangster rap.

6400
02:51:57,350 --> 02:51:58,183
Oh Shit.

6401
02:51:59,510 --> 02:52:00,200
Uppercuts.

6402
02:52:00,200 --> 02:52:00,700
Oh,

6403
02:52:00,700 --> 02:52:01,450
fucking tough.

6404
02:52:01,450 --> 02:52:02,360
Is Roy Nelson.

6405
02:52:02,650 --> 02:52:02,921
Boom,

6406
02:52:02,921 --> 02:52:03,291
boom,

6407
02:52:03,291 --> 02:52:03,591
boom,

6408
02:52:03,591 --> 02:52:03,860
boom.

6409
02:52:03,860 --> 02:52:04,910
Oh my goodness.

6410
02:52:05,290 --> 02:52:06,700
Oh Shit.

6411
02:52:06,740 --> 02:52:08,800
Fuck bond.

6412
02:52:09,710 --> 02:52:14,290
Nasty elbows look to
the Chin of Roy Nelson.

6413
02:52:14,320 --> 02:52:14,891
Oh my God.

6414
02:52:14,891 --> 02:52:16,420
It Barnett keeps mixing it up.

6415
02:52:16,450 --> 02:52:17,283
If Roy took him,

6416
02:52:17,290 --> 02:52:19,280
I mean if a partner
took him down right now,

6417
02:52:19,281 --> 02:52:21,070
I was thinking be over Jesus company.

6418
02:52:21,120 --> 02:52:26,120
These elbow fucking punches the
operate and the upper cut like shit.

6419
02:52:28,000 --> 02:52:28,520
Fuck.

6420
02:52:28,520 --> 02:52:29,353
Oh,

6421
02:52:29,470 --> 02:52:30,580
he doesn't know what's coming,

6422
02:52:30,581 --> 02:52:33,820
whether it's an elbow or an uppercut
and Barnett just keeps changing it up.

6423
02:52:35,070 --> 02:52:37,360
It's weird how Roy national job,

6424
02:52:37,420 --> 02:52:40,870
he's doing such a professional
job of mixing up this technique.

6425
02:52:42,970 --> 02:52:43,803
You know,

6426
02:52:43,880 --> 02:52:45,060
you still have his podcast.

6427
02:52:45,250 --> 02:52:46,000
No,

6428
02:52:46,000 --> 02:52:46,721
he doesn't do it anymore.

6429
02:52:46,721 --> 02:52:47,554
Nope.

6430
02:52:49,200 --> 02:52:50,820
Oh Great.

6431
02:52:50,910 --> 02:52:51,740
Yes.

6432
02:52:51,740 --> 02:52:52,940
I love having him on as a guest.

6433
02:52:53,350 --> 02:52:54,183
Super interesting.

6434
02:52:54,800 --> 02:52:55,730
Super Smart Man.

6435
02:52:56,960 --> 02:52:57,290
He's gonna.

6436
02:52:57,290 --> 02:52:58,250
Break his elbow.

6437
02:52:58,670 --> 02:52:59,503
Oh Shit.

6438
02:52:59,960 --> 02:53:02,170
And Roy comes back with
an elbow his own again.

6439
02:53:02,390 --> 02:53:04,280
Josh Barnett is in crazy shape.

6440
02:53:08,830 --> 02:53:09,990
Josh,

6441
02:53:11,530 --> 02:53:14,060
this is Joshua for leg.

6442
02:53:14,090 --> 02:53:16,490
Does he roll down his style?

6443
02:53:16,491 --> 02:53:17,210
Catch wrestling?

6444
02:53:17,210 --> 02:53:17,361
Yeah.

6445
02:53:17,361 --> 02:53:18,320
He'll try to roll for a leg.

6446
02:53:18,321 --> 02:53:19,340
If he got his leg in between.

6447
02:53:21,020 --> 02:53:21,590
There we go.

6448
02:53:21,590 --> 02:53:22,850
But if he gets his leg in between them,

6449
02:53:22,851 --> 02:53:23,870
he will drop and roll.

6450
02:53:25,730 --> 02:53:26,120
Rolling,

6451
02:53:26,120 --> 02:53:26,953
man.

6452
02:53:27,300 --> 02:53:27,790
Look at this.

6453
02:53:27,790 --> 02:53:28,780
He's going for that Kimora.

6454
02:53:28,880 --> 02:53:29,900
Use it to stand up.

6455
02:53:30,260 --> 02:53:31,093
Look at that.

6456
02:53:31,650 --> 02:53:34,340
Can make steroid defend
it and then stands up.

6457
02:53:34,341 --> 02:53:35,061
Goes to the defense,

6458
02:53:35,061 --> 02:53:35,894
turns around.

6459
02:53:37,010 --> 02:53:37,843
Smart man.

6460
02:53:37,850 --> 02:53:38,930
This is a great fight,

6461
02:53:38,931 --> 02:53:39,510
man.

6462
02:53:39,510 --> 02:53:40,790
It was a great fight.

6463
02:53:41,820 --> 02:53:42,540
No,

6464
02:53:42,540 --> 02:53:44,550
I'd love to see Barnett vs Arlovski.

6465
02:53:46,380 --> 02:53:47,480
That'd be really good at.

6466
02:53:47,990 --> 02:53:49,980
Around five is going to
end right at three hours.

6467
02:53:50,130 --> 02:53:50,550
Okay.

6468
02:53:50,550 --> 02:53:53,280
Well just we'll restart
it in between rounds.

6469
02:53:55,460 --> 02:53:57,050
We can't leave the people hanging here.

6470
02:53:57,140 --> 02:53:59,570
What if something crazy happens
and we don't have it on film

6471
02:54:01,130 --> 02:54:01,850
after this round.

6472
02:54:01,850 --> 02:54:02,900
You have to start?

6473
02:54:02,960 --> 02:54:03,291
Yeah,

6474
02:54:03,291 --> 02:54:07,580
because we're at three hours because the
fight is going over because I guess no

6475
02:54:07,581 --> 02:54:09,650
one thought that the
fights would go that long,

6476
02:54:09,651 --> 02:54:10,640
but how would that possible?

6477
02:54:10,641 --> 02:54:12,500
Because our block.

6478
02:54:12,501 --> 02:54:14,810
Is that what they do and
nothing's a stream or something,

6479
02:54:14,840 --> 02:54:17,450
but all the funds went to
decision except for Uriah though,

6480
02:54:17,500 --> 02:54:18,270
right?

6481
02:54:18,270 --> 02:54:19,430
That's probably what it is.

6482
02:54:21,770 --> 02:54:22,550
Damn.

6483
02:54:22,550 --> 02:54:23,690
This is a great fight.

6484
02:54:24,440 --> 02:54:27,470
I like Josh to southpaw style
too with that fucking left kick.

6485
02:54:27,471 --> 02:54:28,304
He keeps around.

6486
02:54:29,190 --> 02:54:30,920
Seems like Josh is definitely a factor.

6487
02:54:31,240 --> 02:54:32,073
Corsi is.

6488
02:54:32,120 --> 02:54:32,953
How could he not?

6489
02:54:33,230 --> 02:54:34,070
Roy is too though.

6490
02:54:34,071 --> 02:54:34,904
Look at both of them.

6491
02:54:35,480 --> 02:54:37,550
Josh had position position.

6492
02:54:37,700 --> 02:54:38,533
C'Mon.

6493
02:54:39,150 --> 02:54:40,010
That's exhausting.

6494
02:54:40,330 --> 02:54:41,163
It's exhausting.

6495
02:54:41,320 --> 02:54:43,730
Every time he's adjusting stays on.

6496
02:54:43,731 --> 02:54:45,080
It's hard to pull off a technique,

6497
02:54:45,081 --> 02:54:46,820
a counter technique when
you've got someone's head up.

6498
02:54:46,940 --> 02:54:47,320
Tell you what,

6499
02:54:47,320 --> 02:54:47,540
man,

6500
02:54:47,540 --> 02:54:51,050
both these guys have been in there with
just the best of the best thing about

6501
02:54:51,051 --> 02:54:52,520
Roy's fights in the UFC.

6502
02:54:52,700 --> 02:54:53,001
Yeah,

6503
02:54:53,001 --> 02:54:54,810
but if you think about experience wise,

6504
02:54:54,830 --> 02:54:59,830
wouldn't you give Barnett the edge seen
on 100 percent went missing from his

6505
02:55:00,201 --> 02:55:00,561
resume.

6506
02:55:00,561 --> 02:55:01,840
Was fader true?

6507
02:55:02,240 --> 02:55:02,610
True.

6508
02:55:02,610 --> 02:55:03,443
But if,

6509
02:55:04,810 --> 02:55:05,360
if you,

6510
02:55:05,360 --> 02:55:06,980
if you go to UFC experience,

6511
02:55:06,981 --> 02:55:08,260
it's Roy far.

6512
02:55:08,350 --> 02:55:09,183
Yup.

6513
02:55:09,230 --> 02:55:09,800
What happened?

6514
02:55:09,800 --> 02:55:10,370
What happened?

6515
02:55:10,370 --> 02:55:11,050
Did he hit him low?

6516
02:55:11,050 --> 02:55:11,631
Hit in the nuts.

6517
02:55:11,631 --> 02:55:13,330
Get that restaurant right at the bells.

6518
02:55:13,430 --> 02:55:14,263
At the end of the rail.

6519
02:55:15,020 --> 02:55:15,853
Wow.

6520
02:55:16,580 --> 02:55:17,413
Let's see this.

6521
02:55:17,720 --> 02:55:18,680
Oh Jesus.

6522
02:55:19,680 --> 02:55:19,940
I'm.

6523
02:55:19,940 --> 02:55:20,091
No,

6524
02:55:20,091 --> 02:55:20,690
that's the gut.

6525
02:55:20,690 --> 02:55:20,931
No,

6526
02:55:20,931 --> 02:55:21,441
hold up.

6527
02:55:21,441 --> 02:55:22,041
Hold up.

6528
02:55:22,041 --> 02:55:22,874
Let's see if he gets.

6529
02:55:23,170 --> 02:55:24,550
This is just the beat down.

6530
02:55:24,860 --> 02:55:25,880
Jesus Christ.

6531
02:55:25,881 --> 02:55:27,260
These are awesome combinations.

6532
02:55:27,650 --> 02:55:29,030
There's a vicious uppercut bro.

6533
02:55:29,031 --> 02:55:32,240
You know who roy fought after he
got knocked out by hunt over it.

6534
02:55:32,270 --> 02:55:33,051
Right to her leg lock.

6535
02:55:33,051 --> 02:55:33,471
Oh,

6536
02:55:33,471 --> 02:55:34,221
that's right.

6537
02:55:34,221 --> 02:55:34,681
That's right.

6538
02:55:34,681 --> 02:55:35,540
Right foot over him.

6539
02:55:35,570 --> 02:55:36,670
That was in last fight.

6540
02:55:36,850 --> 02:55:38,150
It was a good fight over him.

6541
02:55:38,151 --> 02:55:39,620
Had to stay the fuck away from him.

6542
02:55:39,830 --> 02:55:40,210
Yeah.

6543
02:55:40,210 --> 02:55:41,590
And Roy knocked him down once,

6544
02:55:42,290 --> 02:55:44,030
overcomes the jds next.

6545
02:55:44,050 --> 02:55:44,883
Correct.

6546
02:55:45,300 --> 02:55:50,300
What a fight that's going to be holy shit
been for when you want to see overeem

6547
02:55:50,361 --> 02:55:51,260
versus Barnett.

6548
02:55:51,950 --> 02:55:52,700
I would love that.

6549
02:55:52,700 --> 02:55:54,410
That would be fucking interesting.

6550
02:55:54,470 --> 02:55:55,370
Super interesting.

6551
02:55:55,400 --> 02:55:57,200
That might be that fight.

6552
02:55:57,410 --> 02:55:58,580
I just think he's tougher.

6553
02:55:58,930 --> 02:56:00,750
I'd never find each other and pride her.

6554
02:56:00,860 --> 02:56:01,500
Nope.

6555
02:56:01,500 --> 02:56:03,320
That'll be a great fucking fight,

6556
02:56:03,321 --> 02:56:03,560
man.

6557
02:56:03,560 --> 02:56:06,140
I think Barnett [inaudible]
Barnett Overeem,

6558
02:56:06,400 --> 02:56:09,850
there's a bunch of guys for fuck

6559
02:56:11,590 --> 02:56:12,040
heavyweight,

6560
02:56:12,040 --> 02:56:15,340
the easiest job to make
fights jds and over him.

6561
02:56:15,341 --> 02:56:16,440
He's a great fight though and there.

6562
02:56:16,441 --> 02:56:18,890
There's been a lot of shit talking
over the year and hate each other.

6563
02:56:18,891 --> 02:56:19,724
Huh?

6564
02:56:19,840 --> 02:56:20,060
Yeah.

6565
02:56:20,060 --> 02:56:20,481
I wonder,

6566
02:56:20,481 --> 02:56:20,900
uh,

6567
02:56:20,900 --> 02:56:23,390
I mean it's a good time because
over Ian's got some confidence now.

6568
02:56:24,530 --> 02:56:25,160
I think so.

6569
02:56:25,160 --> 02:56:25,940
I don't think so.

6570
02:56:25,940 --> 02:56:26,151
Well,

6571
02:56:26,151 --> 02:56:28,940
I think so because jds
has had some trouble.

6572
02:56:28,970 --> 02:56:32,540
It's a good time for the body by Barnett.

6573
02:56:34,810 --> 02:56:36,260
I think it's a good time for overeem.

6574
02:56:36,261 --> 02:56:37,610
It's bad for JDF.

6575
02:56:37,640 --> 02:56:38,473
That's what I mean.

6576
02:56:38,480 --> 02:56:40,280
And I think that if it was earlier,

6577
02:56:40,640 --> 02:56:43,790
it would have been a good time
for jds and a bad time for ovary.

6578
02:56:43,840 --> 02:56:44,673
I agree.

6579
02:56:44,750 --> 02:56:46,400
Josh Barnett pouring it on.

6580
02:56:46,610 --> 02:56:47,151
I agree 100.

6581
02:56:47,151 --> 02:56:51,440
So I think like right now though
is like the closest it's been,

6582
02:56:52,320 --> 02:56:52,731
you know,

6583
02:56:52,731 --> 02:56:56,660
I think I would have given overeem and
edge if you would have the overeem that

6584
02:56:56,661 --> 02:56:57,530
fought brock,

6585
02:56:58,640 --> 02:57:00,600
that motherfucker over the world.

6586
02:57:02,320 --> 02:57:03,890
That's the only fight ever in my life.

6587
02:57:03,891 --> 02:57:04,560
They would have called me.

6588
02:57:04,560 --> 02:57:04,881
I'm like,

6589
02:57:04,881 --> 02:57:05,660
no good man.

6590
02:57:05,660 --> 02:57:06,493
Not Interested.

6591
02:57:06,590 --> 02:57:07,220
Nom hurt.

6592
02:57:07,220 --> 02:57:07,671
What he got?

6593
02:57:07,671 --> 02:57:08,121
I don't know.

6594
02:57:08,121 --> 02:57:08,900
Make something on that.

6595
02:57:08,900 --> 02:57:13,900
Yo Stop feeling that overeem the 265
pounds shredded overeem regardless of

6596
02:57:17,151 --> 02:57:19,280
substances that enhance that position.

6597
02:57:19,610 --> 02:57:21,170
That motherfucker was terrifying.

6598
02:57:21,440 --> 02:57:22,280
So that guy,

6599
02:57:22,530 --> 02:57:24,830
I like him over,

6600
02:57:24,831 --> 02:57:25,550
uh,

6601
02:57:25,550 --> 02:57:28,190
a lot of people maybe even
over junior dos Santos,

6602
02:57:28,191 --> 02:57:28,851
but bro,

6603
02:57:28,851 --> 02:57:30,020
I like Kim over judo.

6604
02:57:30,020 --> 02:57:32,210
Sentos and cane at the same time.

6605
02:57:33,200 --> 02:57:34,033
Fuck,

6606
02:57:34,070 --> 02:57:35,750
that guy was on another note.

6607
02:57:35,780 --> 02:57:36,650
I don't know though.

6608
02:57:36,651 --> 02:57:39,440
I don't know if he will be able
to do that to Cain in that fight.

6609
02:57:39,441 --> 02:57:39,681
I mean,

6610
02:57:39,681 --> 02:57:40,760
what would he have been able to keep?

6611
02:57:40,761 --> 02:57:41,271
What you got to think?

6612
02:57:41,271 --> 02:57:41,661
First of all,

6613
02:57:41,661 --> 02:57:42,800
we're looking at their results,

6614
02:57:43,010 --> 02:57:45,110
but we're not thinking about
the players because Josh,

6615
02:57:45,230 --> 02:57:47,060
I mean I'm A.

6616
02:57:47,060 --> 02:57:48,470
Brock Lesnar was coming
off a stomach surgery,

6617
02:57:48,530 --> 02:57:49,310
I don't know,

6618
02:57:49,310 --> 02:57:50,800
12 inches on the homeland.

6619
02:57:50,870 --> 02:57:53,260
Robert was touching him and just fuck it.

6620
02:57:53,270 --> 02:57:54,103
Looked like it hurt.

6621
02:57:54,410 --> 02:57:54,920
Yeah,

6622
02:57:54,920 --> 02:57:55,161
I mean,

6623
02:57:55,161 --> 02:57:55,450
look,

6624
02:57:55,450 --> 02:57:56,420
overeem's terrifying.

6625
02:57:56,450 --> 02:57:57,910
There's no doubt about this.

6626
02:57:58,010 --> 02:57:59,690
This new room is not as terrifying.

6627
02:57:59,800 --> 02:58:00,440
Well,

6628
02:58:00,440 --> 02:58:01,650
it's not the same guy,

6629
02:58:01,710 --> 02:58:02,130
you know?

6630
02:58:02,130 --> 02:58:03,000
I mean physically,

6631
02:58:03,330 --> 02:58:03,601
no,

6632
02:58:03,601 --> 02:58:04,320
not even close,

6633
02:58:04,320 --> 02:58:08,490
but we don't know how much of that fight
was over him and how much of it was.

6634
02:58:08,491 --> 02:58:09,960
Brock lesnar really
should have been fighting.

6635
02:58:10,020 --> 02:58:10,490
I agree.

6636
02:58:10,490 --> 02:58:10,740
What,

6637
02:58:10,740 --> 02:58:12,210
what MMA legend.

6638
02:58:12,211 --> 02:58:17,211
You have surgeon did a valentine
over and beat randy couture.

6639
02:58:17,490 --> 02:58:18,180
Huh?

6640
02:58:18,180 --> 02:58:18,750
Hold up.

6641
02:58:18,750 --> 02:58:20,880
He beat a Valentine beat.

6642
02:58:21,650 --> 02:58:21,810
Her.

6643
02:58:21,810 --> 02:58:22,643
Joe Said,

6644
02:58:22,860 --> 02:58:23,950
don't act like you're just,

6645
02:58:24,760 --> 02:58:25,790
you're just said red.

6646
02:58:26,220 --> 02:58:28,110
He gets named Randy cookie tapped,

6647
02:58:28,960 --> 02:58:30,720
but he never fought in the UFC.

6648
02:58:30,721 --> 02:58:32,310
He also beat Ray Sefo,

6649
02:58:32,730 --> 02:58:33,451
which is old school,

6650
02:58:33,451 --> 02:58:34,930
but he got him in a neck.

6651
02:58:34,931 --> 02:58:35,250
Right,

6652
02:58:35,250 --> 02:58:35,910
right.

6653
02:58:35,910 --> 02:58:38,610
But raise more of a [inaudible]
legend that he is a UFC legend.

6654
02:58:38,620 --> 02:58:38,790
Right?

6655
02:58:38,790 --> 02:58:39,010
Yeah.

6656
02:58:39,010 --> 02:58:40,700
Last time I'm fine

6657
02:58:42,960 --> 02:58:44,290
with it.

6658
02:58:44,330 --> 02:58:45,880
It's that

6659
02:58:47,470 --> 02:58:48,303
whole,

6660
02:58:49,870 --> 02:58:50,640
uh,

6661
02:58:50,640 --> 02:58:50,970
ensign.

6662
02:58:50,970 --> 02:58:51,420
Anyway.

6663
02:58:51,420 --> 02:58:52,010
Arm barred.

6664
02:58:52,010 --> 02:58:52,260
Randy,

6665
02:58:52,260 --> 02:58:57,000
remember that fight incident kicked randy
with some crazy hard kicks off of his

6666
02:58:57,240 --> 02:58:58,073
side.

6667
02:58:58,320 --> 02:59:00,180
Like he was like lying on his side,

6668
02:59:00,181 --> 02:59:00,570
like in a,

6669
02:59:00,570 --> 02:59:01,510
almost like a semi.

6670
02:59:02,500 --> 02:59:07,500
Hoists doesn't Sakharova to stone's
office back some serious kicks.

6671
02:59:08,161 --> 02:59:09,120
The grandma's knee.

6672
02:59:09,690 --> 02:59:10,523
Yeah.

6673
02:59:13,160 --> 02:59:14,150
Fifth and final reading.

6674
02:59:15,060 --> 02:59:15,850
He does have a more,

6675
02:59:15,850 --> 02:59:16,830
but he doesn't have the legs.

6676
02:59:16,860 --> 02:59:17,693
Right.

6677
02:59:18,390 --> 02:59:19,620
And that's Roy Nelson.

6678
02:59:19,621 --> 02:59:20,790
That promoter is not going to be shit.

6679
02:59:21,360 --> 02:59:23,150
It's going to be hard to josh by Nick.

6680
02:59:24,140 --> 02:59:24,973
Um,

6681
02:59:25,060 --> 02:59:25,670
um,

6682
02:59:25,670 --> 02:59:30,210
but it was like on a side thrown
roundhouse kick to the leg.

6683
02:59:30,360 --> 02:59:32,250
Fucking hard kicks man.

6684
02:59:32,700 --> 02:59:33,780
Like I remember thinking like,

6685
02:59:33,810 --> 02:59:34,051
Whoa,

6686
02:59:34,051 --> 02:59:36,390
I didn't know you could throw
kicks like that from your side.

6687
02:59:36,391 --> 02:59:38,460
Like that's first time
I've seen a guy do that.

6688
02:59:38,490 --> 02:59:39,330
Oh Shit Roy.

6689
02:59:40,050 --> 02:59:41,130
Not much time left.

6690
02:59:41,520 --> 02:59:42,450
Oh,

6691
02:59:42,490 --> 02:59:42,840
nasty.

6692
02:59:42,840 --> 02:59:43,673
Needed the body.

6693
02:59:43,830 --> 02:59:46,250
How about randy couture set
of Bell Toro to sign fate?

6694
02:59:46,260 --> 02:59:47,450
Or He'd want to still fight him.

6695
02:59:47,620 --> 02:59:48,410
Did he really say that?

6696
02:59:48,410 --> 02:59:50,070
How old is randy doesn't.

6697
02:59:51,090 --> 02:59:52,680
He said he was interested in that fight.

6698
02:59:52,730 --> 02:59:52,890
Well,

6699
02:59:52,890 --> 02:59:53,880
if he's interested,

6700
02:59:54,210 --> 02:59:56,220
we don't know who fader
is fighting in Japan.

6701
02:59:56,550 --> 03:00:01,170
If Japan really wants to make some money
that's filed is randy couture that 50

6702
03:00:01,171 --> 03:00:03,210
to 50 2:52.

6703
03:00:03,240 --> 03:00:03,661
Hey Man,

6704
03:00:03,661 --> 03:00:04,381
let's not do that.

6705
03:00:04,381 --> 03:00:05,214
Huh?

6706
03:00:05,910 --> 03:00:06,740
How about that?

6707
03:00:06,740 --> 03:00:07,470
I'm all for it.

6708
03:00:07,470 --> 03:00:08,250
Fuck no,

6709
03:00:08,250 --> 03:00:08,931
I'm all for it.

6710
03:00:08,931 --> 03:00:09,120
I would.

6711
03:00:09,120 --> 03:00:14,100
Let's make $50 a new Ford Kimbo slice
and make sure that randy couture is 52.

6712
03:00:14,190 --> 03:00:14,431
Could you,

6713
03:00:14,431 --> 03:00:15,120
could you look that up?

6714
03:00:15,120 --> 03:00:15,930
Bob Sapp.

6715
03:00:15,930 --> 03:00:17,130
Medowra nosy.

6716
03:00:17,160 --> 03:00:20,820
What if it's whatever they
kimbo fade or horrendous.

6717
03:00:22,110 --> 03:00:22,551
Horrendous.

6718
03:00:22,551 --> 03:00:23,580
You mean awesome.

6719
03:00:23,610 --> 03:00:24,091
No Man,

6720
03:00:24,091 --> 03:00:25,020
there'll be so wrong.

6721
03:00:25,180 --> 03:00:25,890
Dude.

6722
03:00:25,890 --> 03:00:26,910
That'd be so fucked up.

6723
03:00:27,060 --> 03:00:28,690
A juiced up Faye door.

6724
03:00:31,760 --> 03:00:33,300
Maybe 50 something right.

6725
03:00:33,510 --> 03:00:33,691
Ken.

6726
03:00:33,691 --> 03:00:34,750
Shamrock shredded.

6727
03:00:34,800 --> 03:00:38,490
But if someone comes back and
he's at his old skill level,

6728
03:00:38,580 --> 03:00:40,110
that's a terrible mismatch.

6729
03:00:40,500 --> 03:00:42,840
I mean that's a big if bro.

6730
03:00:43,080 --> 03:00:43,291
Well,

6731
03:00:43,291 --> 03:00:44,700
if they're letting them fight in Japan,

6732
03:00:44,750 --> 03:00:45,960
if Japan doesn't have any,

6733
03:00:46,140 --> 03:00:48,120
we're not saying I just want
to get right out of the way.

6734
03:00:48,210 --> 03:00:51,330
Don't accuse me of
accusing him of juicing,

6735
03:00:51,360 --> 03:00:52,950
but let's just say.

6736
03:00:53,400 --> 03:00:55,960
Let's just say we go back to the vandelay.

6737
03:00:57,530 --> 03:00:59,030
Kelly's Roy.

6738
03:00:59,750 --> 03:01:00,220
Go for

6739
03:01:00,220 --> 03:01:01,053
it.

6740
03:01:01,270 --> 03:01:02,103
Going for it.

6741
03:01:02,200 --> 03:01:03,160
He is going for it.

6742
03:01:03,220 --> 03:01:03,910
Fuck it.

6743
03:01:03,910 --> 03:01:04,750
Fifteen seconds.

6744
03:01:04,780 --> 03:01:06,480
Oh Shit.

6745
03:01:06,520 --> 03:01:07,151
Nice Combo.

6746
03:01:07,151 --> 03:01:09,310
Josh looked up at the
clock 12 seconds ago.

6747
03:01:11,360 --> 03:01:12,193
Oh,

6748
03:01:13,030 --> 03:01:14,720
it was a hard shot to the forearm.

6749
03:01:14,780 --> 03:01:15,613
A side kick.

6750
03:01:16,600 --> 03:01:17,950
Damn shot.

6751
03:01:18,790 --> 03:01:20,830
What a fucking fight and fight.

6752
03:01:21,030 --> 03:01:21,863
Dan.

6753
03:01:22,840 --> 03:01:24,310
Did we make it out of three hours?

6754
03:01:25,020 --> 03:01:25,780
We're always three.

6755
03:01:25,780 --> 03:01:26,330
Whatever.

6756
03:01:26,330 --> 03:01:29,770
Other trucker a Barnett by decision,

6757
03:01:29,771 --> 03:01:30,604
right?

6758
03:01:30,930 --> 03:01:32,930
So most likely never to.

6759
03:01:33,010 --> 03:01:35,380
I bet they give to them
three to never know.

6760
03:01:35,560 --> 03:01:35,801
I mean,

6761
03:01:35,801 --> 03:01:39,610
we've seen crazier shit
take downs in Japan.

6762
03:01:39,760 --> 03:01:40,091
You can.

6763
03:01:40,091 --> 03:01:40,840
You never know.

6764
03:01:40,840 --> 03:01:41,680
Boom,

6765
03:01:41,770 --> 03:01:42,603
boom.

6766
03:01:42,610 --> 03:01:43,720
What a great fight.

6767
03:01:44,530 --> 03:01:45,370
I'll tell you one thing.

6768
03:01:45,460 --> 03:01:46,091
Unquestionably,

6769
03:01:46,091 --> 03:01:49,300
Josh Barnett looked as good
as he's ever looked like.

6770
03:01:49,390 --> 03:01:49,661
His,

6771
03:01:49,661 --> 03:01:51,160
his physical shape,

6772
03:01:51,780 --> 03:01:53,900
like the combination is the best one.

6773
03:01:53,910 --> 03:01:55,450
Was the tune a long time.

6774
03:01:55,451 --> 03:01:59,230
Roy was way more prepared than
his body would let you think.

6775
03:01:59,740 --> 03:02:00,573
Right?

6776
03:02:01,300 --> 03:02:02,590
I mean he obviously went five,

6777
03:02:02,920 --> 03:02:04,630
never judged by her,

6778
03:02:05,020 --> 03:02:06,340
hurt them in the fifth round.

6779
03:02:06,490 --> 03:02:06,940
You know,

6780
03:02:06,940 --> 03:02:08,830
he still had power in the
fifth and final round.

6781
03:02:08,831 --> 03:02:09,900
Come down four times.

6782
03:02:09,901 --> 03:02:14,901
It took them 10 times and took him down
to fifth and hurt him in the fifth to

6783
03:02:15,240 --> 03:02:16,073
banged them.

6784
03:02:16,810 --> 03:02:18,640
I think he hates him.

6785
03:02:18,641 --> 03:02:20,690
Hard fucking kicks to his arms to match.

6786
03:02:20,710 --> 03:02:21,580
So a guy like Roy,

6787
03:02:21,581 --> 03:02:23,560
he's won one his last five.

6788
03:02:23,590 --> 03:02:24,423
What do you do with that?

6789
03:02:24,970 --> 03:02:26,470
Never let that guy go.

6790
03:02:26,500 --> 03:02:27,580
He's always fun.

6791
03:02:27,820 --> 03:02:29,110
He's always fun to watch,

6792
03:02:29,130 --> 03:02:29,320
man.

6793
03:02:29,320 --> 03:02:30,370
Can't let that guy go.

6794
03:02:30,400 --> 03:02:30,700
No,

6795
03:02:30,700 --> 03:02:35,530
I'm saying if your Roy Roy is hard.

6796
03:02:35,531 --> 03:02:36,221
What do you do?

6797
03:02:36,221 --> 03:02:36,730
You know,

6798
03:02:36,730 --> 03:02:37,563
honestly,

6799
03:02:37,660 --> 03:02:41,470
what he needs to do is what Josh just
showed he needs to get in some serious

6800
03:02:41,490 --> 03:02:42,323
defining themselves.

6801
03:02:42,330 --> 03:02:43,960
Will take some time off.

6802
03:02:44,020 --> 03:02:44,171
Well,

6803
03:02:44,171 --> 03:02:44,500
yeah,

6804
03:02:44,500 --> 03:02:44,861
get me.

6805
03:02:44,861 --> 03:02:47,440
Look how much better Josh
looked with a Dietitian.

6806
03:02:47,441 --> 03:02:47,800
I mean,

6807
03:02:47,800 --> 03:02:49,240
I guess it's a guy who trains with.

6808
03:02:49,420 --> 03:02:53,980
Is a guy who's a prescribed as diet for
him who's monitoring has died for him.

6809
03:02:53,980 --> 03:02:55,480
But look how God Damn Goodie look.

6810
03:02:55,660 --> 03:02:56,710
Five hard rounds.

6811
03:02:56,711 --> 03:02:59,530
I guess I'll bomber like Roy Nelson.

6812
03:03:00,480 --> 03:03:01,530
Scrap scrap.

6813
03:03:01,560 --> 03:03:02,080
Yes.

6814
03:03:02,080 --> 03:03:04,930
And Josh looked great in
the fifth and final round.

6815
03:03:05,440 --> 03:03:06,460
They still had real good.

6816
03:03:06,760 --> 03:03:07,680
They both looked amazing.

6817
03:03:08,530 --> 03:03:10,020
Pouring it on at the end.

6818
03:03:10,050 --> 03:03:10,883
Sure as fuck was.

6819
03:03:10,960 --> 03:03:13,750
But now let's imagine if Roy had
done the same thing that Josh did.

6820
03:03:13,751 --> 03:03:14,890
Would Roy won that fight?

6821
03:03:15,190 --> 03:03:15,731
Who knows,

6822
03:03:15,731 --> 03:03:16,300
man,

6823
03:03:16,300 --> 03:03:19,270
if Roy had did the same thing that
Josh Day as far as monitoring his diet,

6824
03:03:19,420 --> 03:03:22,630
but it could still hit that
fucking hard and lost the body fat,

6825
03:03:22,631 --> 03:03:23,890
had more gas in his tank,

6826
03:03:24,040 --> 03:03:27,340
was able to pour it on more will
disable the counter more off the cage.

6827
03:03:27,341 --> 03:03:29,950
The difference in this really wasn't
really striking was that it was this

6828
03:03:30,010 --> 03:03:30,520
takedowns.

6829
03:03:30,520 --> 03:03:31,121
His grappling.

6830
03:03:31,121 --> 03:03:31,330
I was,

6831
03:03:31,330 --> 03:03:35,320
let's say he loses weight so there's
taking pitches down and not losing the

6832
03:03:35,321 --> 03:03:37,110
position because of scrambled eggs like,

6833
03:03:37,130 --> 03:03:37,311
you know,

6834
03:03:37,311 --> 03:03:37,671
not,

6835
03:03:37,671 --> 03:03:39,190
not conserving his gas tank.

6836
03:03:39,820 --> 03:03:40,750
Tremendous shape.

6837
03:03:40,751 --> 03:03:41,410
Let's say.

6838
03:03:41,410 --> 03:03:43,330
Let's say he got down to one 85.

6839
03:03:43,480 --> 03:03:45,790
Can you imagine how good
his Jujitsu would look?

6840
03:03:45,850 --> 03:03:46,331
Oh my God.

6841
03:03:46,331 --> 03:03:47,164
Incredible.

6842
03:03:47,490 --> 03:03:47,771
I mean,

6843
03:03:47,771 --> 03:03:48,161
who knows?

6844
03:03:48,161 --> 03:03:48,671
One 85.

6845
03:03:48,671 --> 03:03:50,080
We were kind of talking crazy.

6846
03:03:50,081 --> 03:03:53,480
We really want to lose 85 pounds.

6847
03:03:53,530 --> 03:03:54,700
You're talking about a different case.

6848
03:03:54,870 --> 03:03:55,601
He's a big guy.

6849
03:03:55,601 --> 03:03:56,740
Jujitsu too heavy.

6850
03:03:56,741 --> 03:03:57,321
You know what I'm saying?

6851
03:03:57,321 --> 03:03:58,120
Like that's his gate

6852
03:03:58,120 --> 03:03:59,240
on the how light it could be,

6853
03:03:59,300 --> 03:03:59,700
but what?

6854
03:03:59,700 --> 03:03:59,890
What?

6855
03:03:59,890 --> 03:04:00,111
What?

6856
03:04:00,111 --> 03:04:02,660
Could it be happening gentlemen?

6857
03:04:02,661 --> 03:04:03,494
Come on man.

6858
03:04:03,500 --> 03:04:04,130
Look at that.

6859
03:04:04,130 --> 03:04:04,551
No,

6860
03:04:04,551 --> 03:04:05,241
no man.

6861
03:04:05,241 --> 03:04:06,530
You might be wrong though,

6862
03:04:07,820 --> 03:04:08,630
because look,

6863
03:04:08,630 --> 03:04:09,980
what if he loses 50 pounds?

6864
03:04:10,040 --> 03:04:10,281
Okay.

6865
03:04:10,281 --> 03:04:11,930
If you this your man's just to 10.

6866
03:04:12,080 --> 03:04:13,240
If he loses to townies,

6867
03:04:13,250 --> 03:04:14,083
Chris Weidman,

6868
03:04:14,120 --> 03:04:14,810
and then he gets.

6869
03:04:14,810 --> 03:04:15,141
Yeah.

6870
03:04:15,141 --> 03:04:20,141
And then you think about that all
sound fun that you want to bet 10 g's.

6871
03:04:21,440 --> 03:04:24,020
Boy never gets some when 85 tens years.

6872
03:04:24,440 --> 03:04:25,550
Josh Barnett.

6873
03:04:26,550 --> 03:04:27,360
Warm master.

6874
03:04:27,360 --> 03:04:28,193
Congratulations.

6875
03:04:28,710 --> 03:04:29,660
He's not even breathing heavy.

6876
03:04:29,810 --> 03:04:30,081
Well,

6877
03:04:30,081 --> 03:04:31,340
I mean he's tired for sure.

6878
03:04:31,430 --> 03:04:33,710
It's a hell of a fucking hell of a fight.

6879
03:04:33,820 --> 03:04:34,820
She's a hell of a fight.

6880
03:04:35,230 --> 03:04:36,650
God Damn Josh Barnett.

6881
03:04:36,890 --> 03:04:38,780
Let me see if you say some
crazy progress on shit.

6882
03:04:39,230 --> 03:04:43,070
Crank that shit up because sometimes he
says crazy progress and show usually.

6883
03:04:43,071 --> 03:04:44,270
Good boy.

6884
03:04:44,830 --> 03:04:45,860
He picked me up once.

6885
03:04:45,950 --> 03:04:48,230
I felt like a pillow after the fight.

6886
03:04:48,231 --> 03:04:49,910
He was still jazzed up after the,

6887
03:04:49,950 --> 03:04:50,780
uh,

6888
03:04:50,780 --> 03:04:51,540
Frank Mir fight.

6889
03:04:51,540 --> 03:04:54,400
He hoisted me up in the air like a throat,

6890
03:04:56,300 --> 03:04:57,021
like a star.

6891
03:04:57,021 --> 03:04:59,870
Like a welcome mat was welcoming.

6892
03:05:00,550 --> 03:05:04,730
But I felt like Josh should
have said Satanic Tattoo.

6893
03:05:04,790 --> 03:05:06,230
It's going to talk in Japanese.

6894
03:05:07,310 --> 03:05:08,143
He talks Japanese.

6895
03:05:13,680 --> 03:05:15,080
That's where the money comes in.

6896
03:05:15,420 --> 03:05:16,260
They love him over there,

6897
03:05:16,261 --> 03:05:17,040
man.

6898
03:05:17,040 --> 03:05:17,873
Japanese man.

6899
03:05:21,320 --> 03:05:23,900
What a style is getting big laughs.

6900
03:05:25,210 --> 03:05:25,580
Good,

6901
03:05:25,580 --> 03:05:26,360
good,

6902
03:05:26,360 --> 03:05:27,193
isn't it?

6903
03:05:27,250 --> 03:05:29,450
So you're going to be
such an unusual dude.

6904
03:05:29,480 --> 03:05:29,661
Yeah.

6905
03:05:29,661 --> 03:05:31,530
He's a weird guy.

6906
03:05:33,020 --> 03:05:34,640
I respect the fuck out of that guy though.

6907
03:05:35,500 --> 03:05:36,710
I'm am not going to hang out with them,

6908
03:05:36,711 --> 03:05:38,450
but for sure you wouldn't
hang out with him.

6909
03:05:38,510 --> 03:05:39,111
I probably would.

6910
03:05:39,111 --> 03:05:40,010
We're just so different,

6911
03:05:40,040 --> 03:05:40,340
man.

6912
03:05:40,340 --> 03:05:41,110
You would love him.

6913
03:05:41,110 --> 03:05:41,661
You would love him.

6914
03:05:41,661 --> 03:05:42,050
Really?

6915
03:05:42,050 --> 03:05:42,201
Yeah.

6916
03:05:42,201 --> 03:05:43,034
He's awesome.

6917
03:05:43,190 --> 03:05:44,870
I'm a big fan of Josh Barnett as a person.

6918
03:05:45,380 --> 03:05:46,280
I like hanging out with them.

6919
03:05:46,400 --> 03:05:47,660
I love having him on the podcast.

6920
03:05:47,960 --> 03:05:48,950
He's great on your podcast.

6921
03:05:48,980 --> 03:05:49,760
Smart motherfucker.

6922
03:05:49,760 --> 03:05:50,500
Dude.

6923
03:05:50,500 --> 03:05:53,040
As smart and as well read and as you know,

6924
03:05:53,050 --> 03:05:55,580
is nuanced in his thinking as a,

6925
03:05:55,581 --> 03:05:56,420
as anybody I know.

6926
03:05:56,600 --> 03:05:58,470
And he's a professional
fighter at the highest level.

6927
03:05:59,020 --> 03:05:59,870
Nothing I didn't hear.

6928
03:05:59,871 --> 03:06:02,070
It was good enough that I.

6929
03:06:02,070 --> 03:06:02,090
Nothing

6930
03:06:02,090 --> 03:06:03,510
I did in here was good enough tonight.

6931
03:06:03,540 --> 03:06:04,980
He's a fucking monster.

6932
03:06:05,080 --> 03:06:05,281
Oh,

6933
03:06:05,281 --> 03:06:06,840
he's on a fucking bender right now.

6934
03:06:07,040 --> 03:06:08,580
Or that's not the right word.

6935
03:06:08,610 --> 03:06:10,220
Bender vendors for drinking.

6936
03:06:10,590 --> 03:06:11,423
Yeah,

6937
03:06:11,610 --> 03:06:13,020
he's on a run is what I meant to say.

6938
03:06:13,110 --> 03:06:13,790
Yeah,

6939
03:06:13,790 --> 03:06:14,860
he's doing well.

6940
03:06:14,861 --> 03:06:15,694
That's what I like to say.

6941
03:06:15,720 --> 03:06:17,100
He's not a real bender,

6942
03:06:18,000 --> 03:06:18,940
ladies and gentlemen,

6943
03:06:20,160 --> 03:06:21,780
Mouth Insert foot.

6944
03:06:21,990 --> 03:06:23,210
It would be one thing if I didn't do this.

6945
03:06:23,560 --> 03:06:24,770
He's looking at Josh Barnett.

6946
03:06:24,810 --> 03:06:25,321
Oh my God.

6947
03:06:25,321 --> 03:06:27,050
Are you looking at eyes and said

6948
03:06:32,130 --> 03:06:33,950
he's like Godzilla fro,

6949
03:06:35,240 --> 03:06:36,073
you know,

6950
03:06:36,340 --> 03:06:38,400
rampage destroys in Japan.

6951
03:06:38,870 --> 03:06:40,770
Deal Destroys Asians in America.

6952
03:06:40,920 --> 03:06:41,910
How dare you bring it up.

6953
03:06:41,950 --> 03:06:43,550
Holly's not here to defend himself.

6954
03:06:44,170 --> 03:06:44,970
He likes,

6955
03:06:44,970 --> 03:06:45,241
you know,

6956
03:06:45,241 --> 03:06:47,160
they're talking about
having rampage fight rumble.

6957
03:06:49,440 --> 03:06:50,430
Why would they do that?

6958
03:06:51,090 --> 03:06:53,400
Have you heard Shogun?

6959
03:06:54,590 --> 03:06:55,423
I liked that.

6960
03:06:55,510 --> 03:06:56,610
Or is Dan Shogun?

6961
03:06:56,670 --> 03:06:57,570
It's Dan Shogun.

6962
03:06:57,750 --> 03:06:59,220
Shogun just had shoulder surgery.

6963
03:06:59,640 --> 03:07:00,600
He's been in a sling,

6964
03:07:00,870 --> 03:07:05,220
like his arm has been a back training as
he was in a sling like really recently.

6965
03:07:05,221 --> 03:07:06,054
Really?

6966
03:07:06,110 --> 03:07:09,320
Like really recently there was photos
of him I think on instagram or something

6967
03:07:09,321 --> 03:07:10,290
like that of him in a sling.

6968
03:07:10,530 --> 03:07:12,220
I read Shogun.

6969
03:07:12,240 --> 03:07:13,020
That's what I heard.

6970
03:07:13,020 --> 03:07:14,390
I'd be crazy for the next fight.

6971
03:07:14,490 --> 03:07:15,390
That's a crazy fight.

6972
03:07:15,391 --> 03:07:17,730
But if shogun did have shoulder surgery,

6973
03:07:17,970 --> 03:07:21,020
I don't know what surgery
had or why rampage I,

6974
03:07:21,050 --> 03:07:21,330
you know,

6975
03:07:21,330 --> 03:07:25,080
I might be making this up because I'm
assuming it was a shoulder thing because

6976
03:07:25,081 --> 03:07:26,640
he had his arm in a sling.

6977
03:07:26,910 --> 03:07:27,690
He have just,

6978
03:07:27,690 --> 03:07:30,420
it could've been something as simple
as like bone spurs in his elbow,

6979
03:07:30,750 --> 03:07:31,800
which is a quick turnaround.

6980
03:07:34,290 --> 03:07:35,460
A lot of guys do.

6981
03:07:35,490 --> 03:07:36,070
What does he say?

6982
03:07:36,070 --> 03:07:36,660
Surgery.

6983
03:07:36,660 --> 03:07:37,350
What does it say?

6984
03:07:37,350 --> 03:07:38,820
Early 2016 return.

6985
03:07:38,850 --> 03:07:39,390
Yeah.

6986
03:07:39,390 --> 03:07:40,890
So it's probably shoulder.

6987
03:07:41,100 --> 03:07:41,581
What does it say?

6988
03:07:41,581 --> 03:07:43,950
Does it say what kind of shirt
show what kind of surgery?

6989
03:07:45,920 --> 03:07:47,930
Young Jamie Shoulder.

6990
03:07:48,650 --> 03:07:49,483
Shoulder,

6991
03:07:49,650 --> 03:07:50,483
shoulder surgery.

6992
03:07:50,550 --> 03:07:52,410
See Shit.

6993
03:07:52,750 --> 03:07:52,920
No,

6994
03:07:52,920 --> 03:07:53,460
I just,

6995
03:07:53,460 --> 03:07:53,820
I did.

6996
03:07:53,820 --> 03:07:55,230
I did hear shogun rampage.

6997
03:07:55,740 --> 03:07:56,573
Well,

6998
03:07:56,730 --> 03:07:58,560
so from a reliable source,

6999
03:07:58,620 --> 03:08:02,250
well now shogun is not gonna
be able to fight until 2016.

7000
03:08:02,280 --> 03:08:03,750
I wonder what they'll do because.

7001
03:08:03,990 --> 03:08:04,141
Well,

7002
03:08:04,141 --> 03:08:04,740
you know what?

7003
03:08:04,740 --> 03:08:05,850
Last blight crime,

7004
03:08:05,851 --> 03:08:06,270
Sun.

7005
03:08:06,270 --> 03:08:09,280
But most of the fights up until
December already accounted for anyway.

7006
03:08:09,600 --> 03:08:12,600
Especially the big end of January
already accounted for anyway.

7007
03:08:12,601 --> 03:08:13,650
So maybe that is the fight,

7008
03:08:14,220 --> 03:08:15,210
but rumble,

7009
03:08:15,570 --> 03:08:18,610
rumble versus rampage will be
crazy for as long as it lasts.

7010
03:08:19,350 --> 03:08:20,340
That's a crazy fight.

7011
03:08:20,360 --> 03:08:21,350
What a rampage winds.

7012
03:08:21,940 --> 03:08:23,000
Rampage can take it.

7013
03:08:23,030 --> 03:08:23,863
And

7014
03:08:25,320 --> 03:08:28,680
I love rampage that I don't
like that fight for him.

7015
03:08:29,510 --> 03:08:30,190
Scary fight.

7016
03:08:30,190 --> 03:08:30,740
Rumble.

7017
03:08:30,740 --> 03:08:31,550
Fine right now.

7018
03:08:31,550 --> 03:08:32,520
Fucking to find out.

7019
03:08:32,600 --> 03:08:33,120
How good did he look?

7020
03:08:33,120 --> 03:08:33,953
He's

7021
03:08:34,800 --> 03:08:35,340
terrifying.

7022
03:08:35,340 --> 03:08:36,390
That Gustafson fight.

7023
03:08:36,391 --> 03:08:37,830
Scared the fucking shit out of me.

7024
03:08:37,920 --> 03:08:40,950
Well then he knocked fucking
homeboy to next week,

7025
03:08:40,980 --> 03:08:41,460
dude.

7026
03:08:41,460 --> 03:08:42,293
He's a monster.

7027
03:08:42,330 --> 03:08:43,163
Straight Monster.

7028
03:08:43,170 --> 03:08:43,411
Yeah.

7029
03:08:43,411 --> 03:08:44,520
He's so good right now.

7030
03:08:44,521 --> 03:08:47,520
And you know what I think is coming
off of that Daniel cormier a loss.

7031
03:08:47,530 --> 03:08:49,800
He's upset with himself
and trade and even harder,

7032
03:08:49,801 --> 03:08:50,920
even more focused tool.

7033
03:08:51,060 --> 03:08:52,050
It's really wide open.

7034
03:08:52,051 --> 03:08:54,330
So grabbing a whole shit
load of pictures of his dog.

7035
03:08:54,530 --> 03:08:55,700
So the dogs,

7036
03:08:56,600 --> 03:08:57,390
you know,

7037
03:08:57,390 --> 03:08:58,290
he's taking it serious.

7038
03:08:58,590 --> 03:08:59,423
What does that mean?

7039
03:09:00,680 --> 03:09:02,670
What proves that he's,

7040
03:09:02,790 --> 03:09:03,271
he's,

7041
03:09:03,271 --> 03:09:03,571
uh,

7042
03:09:03,571 --> 03:09:05,250
an emotional person in the.

7043
03:09:05,260 --> 03:09:05,730
Any.

7044
03:09:05,730 --> 03:09:09,510
His heart is in the right place
because he instagram pics of his dogs.

7045
03:09:09,540 --> 03:09:10,050
Yes.

7046
03:09:10,050 --> 03:09:10,561
It's weird,

7047
03:09:10,561 --> 03:09:10,960
man.

7048
03:09:10,960 --> 03:09:11,793
Got Interesting.

7049
03:09:11,880 --> 03:09:12,330
Take on it.

7050
03:09:12,330 --> 03:09:14,610
Know it bothers me when guys
post quotes all the time.

7051
03:09:15,720 --> 03:09:16,141
Well,

7052
03:09:16,141 --> 03:09:18,980
aren't those guys or girl post quoted

7053
03:09:20,800 --> 03:09:22,260
to stop following the Frank [inaudible]?

7054
03:09:22,261 --> 03:09:23,100
He kept posting quotes.

7055
03:09:23,101 --> 03:09:23,351
Frank,

7056
03:09:23,351 --> 03:09:24,090
who?

7057
03:09:24,090 --> 03:09:24,923
I said a friend.

7058
03:09:24,930 --> 03:09:25,110
Oh,

7059
03:09:25,110 --> 03:09:25,943
I'm not going to blast.

7060
03:09:26,840 --> 03:09:28,220
What kind of quotes are you talking about?

7061
03:09:28,280 --> 03:09:28,690
What?

7062
03:09:28,690 --> 03:09:31,860
Like be strong and follow your um,

7063
03:09:31,861 --> 03:09:32,870
all that shit.

7064
03:09:33,100 --> 03:09:33,933
The light.

7065
03:09:34,360 --> 03:09:36,320
Successful people don't hate on others.

7066
03:09:36,530 --> 03:09:38,160
Just bullshit like that.

7067
03:09:38,290 --> 03:09:38,490
You know,

7068
03:09:38,490 --> 03:09:40,890
it's going to funny bit about
like motivational dudes.

7069
03:09:40,950 --> 03:09:41,900
Online's Leah.

7070
03:09:42,530 --> 03:09:43,770
It's pretty fucking funny man.

7071
03:09:44,100 --> 03:09:44,620
It's crystally.

7072
03:09:44,620 --> 03:09:45,810
It doesn't work out at all.

7073
03:09:45,960 --> 03:09:47,070
And he's got like this,

7074
03:09:47,071 --> 03:09:47,401
uh,

7075
03:09:47,401 --> 03:09:50,380
this is really funny bit about
guys who are telling you like,

7076
03:09:50,430 --> 03:09:52,720
I think it says like Hashtag,

7077
03:09:57,150 --> 03:09:58,210
Hashtag eat a dick,

7078
03:09:58,211 --> 03:09:59,044
see my shoes.

7079
03:09:59,110 --> 03:09:59,660
I'm so,

7080
03:09:59,660 --> 03:10:01,180
so these beast mode shoes.

7081
03:10:01,181 --> 03:10:02,060
And he wrote on there like,

7082
03:10:02,110 --> 03:10:03,370
those fucking suck.

7083
03:10:03,640 --> 03:10:04,630
Then sent me a text.

7084
03:10:04,640 --> 03:10:05,261
I was like,

7085
03:10:05,261 --> 03:10:06,370
why don't you go fuck yourself?

7086
03:10:07,860 --> 03:10:08,380
I put,

7087
03:10:08,380 --> 03:10:09,213
Hey man,

7088
03:10:10,620 --> 03:10:11,070
I love,

7089
03:10:11,070 --> 03:10:12,040
I can design them.

7090
03:10:12,100 --> 03:10:13,780
It's fun to say Hashtag something,

7091
03:10:13,781 --> 03:10:16,970
a lot of community and say that
other Hashtag suck it hashtags.

7092
03:10:17,470 --> 03:10:18,303
People say that all.

7093
03:10:18,450 --> 03:10:19,810
I could catch myself doing it too.

7094
03:10:19,811 --> 03:10:23,160
It's like a really funny thing that people
are doing crazy is when I hashtagged

7095
03:10:23,180 --> 03:10:23,530
the things.

7096
03:10:23,530 --> 03:10:25,170
When I posted a meme,

7097
03:10:25,600 --> 03:10:27,820
I can see like people,

7098
03:10:27,880 --> 03:10:29,410
I could see my uh,

7099
03:10:29,620 --> 03:10:30,670
followers rise.

7100
03:10:30,671 --> 03:10:35,671
But when I post anything like
anti vaccine or any Kinda dude,

7101
03:10:37,420 --> 03:10:38,253
hundreds,

7102
03:10:40,910 --> 03:10:41,820
72,000,

7103
03:10:41,950 --> 03:10:42,581
point eight,

7104
03:10:42,581 --> 03:10:43,870
and then it goes point seven,

7105
03:10:44,050 --> 03:10:44,883
point six,

7106
03:10:48,410 --> 03:10:49,243
two.

7107
03:10:49,530 --> 03:10:51,150
They don't like conspiracy.

7108
03:10:51,490 --> 03:10:53,940
So many followers to line 1111.

7109
03:10:58,160 --> 03:10:58,740
I lost.

7110
03:10:58,740 --> 03:10:59,141
You know what?

7111
03:10:59,141 --> 03:10:59,771
I cleaned them out.

7112
03:10:59,771 --> 03:11:00,311
It's a filter.

7113
03:11:00,311 --> 03:11:01,630
I to clean those fuckers out.

7114
03:11:02,590 --> 03:11:03,180
Whatever.

7115
03:11:03,180 --> 03:11:06,870
I try to watch a video of tower
seven go down and free fall speed

7116
03:11:08,440 --> 03:11:09,760
follows nine slash 11.

7117
03:11:09,790 --> 03:11:10,110
Hey,

7118
03:11:10,110 --> 03:11:11,220
I'm cleaning them out

7119
03:11:12,730 --> 03:11:13,720
to go to the comedy store.

7120
03:11:13,721 --> 03:11:16,200
So we gotta we gotta wrap this show.

7121
03:11:16,590 --> 03:11:17,530
We got to wrap this bitch up.

7122
03:11:17,531 --> 03:11:18,364
