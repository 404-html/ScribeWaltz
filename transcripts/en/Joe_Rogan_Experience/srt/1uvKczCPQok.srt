1
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:03,780
Scared to ask you too many questions 
until we get live.

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:06,480
Well good.
And we're live.

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:10,260
Adam green trees fresh from Australia.
Fresh from the bush.

4
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:11,760
From the bush.
Yeah.

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,880
It's been crazy.
So I was thinking about it and I'm not 

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,160
even la part.
I was just thinking.

7
00:00:17,161 --> 00:00:22,161
I went from the snowy tops of Montana,
got home pretty much had the family 

8
00:00:22,771 --> 00:00:27,771
today.
Death went straight to Arnhem land in 

9
00:00:27,771 --> 00:00:27,900
the northern territory of Australia.
Complete opposite,

10
00:00:27,901 --> 00:00:31,680
like just first thing in the morning.
This wedding covered in mosquitoes,

11
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:36,950
flat barren ground and then.
But now humans like a small indigenous 

12
00:00:37,111 --> 00:00:40,410
population out there and that's it.
Then straight from there,

13
00:00:40,411 --> 00:00:45,411
so straight from Arnhem land to Sydney.
Met came in Sydney and then straight 

14
00:00:45,411 --> 00:00:47,470
here to La and Florida and it's just 
like at night.

15
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:49,230
How many people live here?
Too many.

16
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:54,290
Too many.
There's more people here than in the 

17
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:54,290
entire country of Australia.
That's crazy.

18
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,440
I never lost all his hair and you're 
like,

19
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,620
you know,
this is the safest place on earth of the

20
00:01:01,621 --> 00:01:06,621
safest place in the US and those that,
a armed robbery or whatever they was in 

21
00:01:07,171 --> 00:01:12,171
Calabasas say today when we flew in and 
I went into like a t cell provider to 

22
00:01:13,381 --> 00:01:16,110
get a Sim card at.
Dude walks in,

23
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:21,140
look for dodgy.
I knew something was about to go on the 

24
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:21,540
dude that was so to me,
knew something was going on.

25
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:23,820
I kept seeing him looking over my 
shoulder at this guy.

26
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:28,530
He grabs a bluetooth speaker and it's 
like pretending like he's going to go to

27
00:01:28,531 --> 00:01:31,860
the checkout and I'm just being polite 
and thinking there's something going on.

28
00:01:31,861 --> 00:01:34,380
So let's just get him down and out of 
the store.

29
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,320
Then he goes to do a full runner for it.
Dude,

30
00:01:37,321 --> 00:01:39,330
straight out the door with this 
Bluetooth speaker.

31
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:41,400
But all mate,
like had these runners on and chased him

32
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:43,370
down and go to the orpheum.
Yeah.

33
00:01:43,371 --> 00:01:45,140
Yeah.
And um,

34
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:47,310
I'm like,
every time I come here there's something

35
00:01:47,311 --> 00:01:48,750
crazy going on.
Well,

36
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:53,810
if you're in the wrong place,
the wrong time is plenty of crazy going 

37
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:54,120
on in the show.
That's just so many people.

38
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,530
There's so many people.
That's what it is.

39
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:56,850
Yeah.
There's no way around it,

40
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:00,450
but you know,
fairly safe fit,

41
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,840
shooting water buffalo,
each Sifa.

42
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:10,320
Then fucking people's bullshit.
That's crazy site for them.

43
00:02:10,321 --> 00:02:13,020
People know when you're Adam Green tree 
may be.

44
00:02:13,021 --> 00:02:15,000
It's safer because you know what you're 
doing,

45
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:21,840
but you were telling a story on whose 
podcast was it a J.

46
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,730
Scott's,
I forget whose podcast it was.

47
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:28,800
You were telling a story about one of 
your friends that got gored federal 

48
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,180
labor that got gored by scrub bullying.
That's not good.

49
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,760
No,
it's definitely not good.

50
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:36,960
But I did I tell you that story.
So what happened?

51
00:02:36,961 --> 00:02:38,980
He shot a scrabble telling people 
would've scrubbed bullets.

52
00:02:38,981 --> 00:02:40,740
Yeah.
So scrubbing bubbles like a,

53
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,800
just like domestic cattle,
but it's been out in the wilderness 

54
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:45,800
many,
many generations.

55
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,090
Exactly the way they look and they have 
like a real feral inbred looking.

56
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:53,910
They're crazy look like rice cooking and
they they crazy dangerous.

57
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:56,270
Here's a photo of him we looked at.
I mean,

58
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:01,520
that looks amazing.
That is such a cool looking animal that 

59
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,291
was so much different.
And that's pretty much a purebred 

60
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:04,291
Brahman.
That one.

61
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:04,960
There's that one.
Whoa.

62
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:05,790
Yeah.
That's.

63
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,000
Looks like.
So when you said it's a purebred Brahma,

64
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:10,860
that means,
uh,

65
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,790
that's,
that's a pretty good look bowl.

66
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:15,880
If you go up the top Jaimee,
there's a couple more at the top.

67
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:18,490
That red one that you just done under 
that one day.

68
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,240
That's a pretty typical scrabble a.
that's a,

69
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:22,990
that's a fellow that I know actually in 
Australia.

70
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:24,880
Stick Ball.
He's got.

71
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,250
Yeah,
he's got a by her,

72
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,380
that's what we have with.
Oh Jesus.

73
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:31,660
Why do people do that to themselves?
So the problem with these animals,

74
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:36,490
obviously they don't respect fences and 
now going varied and interbreed with log

75
00:03:36,491 --> 00:03:40,140
of farmer's stock and things like that.
Is that,

76
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,370
is that bad for the farmer started?
Definitely.

77
00:03:42,371 --> 00:03:47,371
Yeah.
That they'll just go straight through 

78
00:03:47,371 --> 00:03:48,991
fences and yeah,
he'll have a heap of carbs and I 

79
00:03:48,991 --> 00:03:50,680
wouldn't be purebred anymore.
And so they're not,

80
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:55,600
they don't good for rebranding or like 
my fixed the same value at the market.

81
00:03:55,601 --> 00:03:58,210
So what is the difference in like the 
genetics,

82
00:03:58,211 --> 00:04:00,490
like what do they look?
They look different,

83
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:05,520
they look different.
So that first bullet Jamie showed was 

84
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,120
like a Brahmin bull,
then one of those scrub bulls,

85
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:12,121
which is just bits of frigging every 
sort of bull over a lot of generations 

86
00:04:12,121 --> 00:04:14,020
will come in and need and buried with it
and then sort of wrecks the hood.

87
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:19,320
And when,
when did they get released or when did 

88
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:19,320
they escape?
Well,

89
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:19,510
it would have been with the cattle that 
come into Australia.

90
00:04:19,511 --> 00:04:21,520
So it would have been hundreds and 
hundreds.

91
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:26,640
Yeah.
So they're just sort of morphed and 

92
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,640
become wild animals and wild bulls.
Very dangerous.

93
00:04:27,641 --> 00:04:28,720
Very dangerous.
Yeah.

94
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,790
So what happened was,
Pedro,

95
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:32,230
I shot these bullets,
dropped,

96
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,960
like dropped unconscious.
He fought it was dead,

97
00:04:34,961 --> 00:04:37,150
walked up to it.
It jumped up.

98
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:40,720
Like he literally got up to it and it 
jumped off and anyway,

99
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,490
it ain't not getting him against the 
tree.

100
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:45,820
Like he ran to get up a tree.
He felt it hit him and it sort of lifted

101
00:04:45,821 --> 00:04:50,821
him up the tree.
He climbed up the tree is the growth 

102
00:04:50,821 --> 00:04:52,330
vit.
Then he felt something warm and his legs

103
00:04:52,331 --> 00:04:54,330
and look down and he's got and 
everything hanging down.

104
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:57,550
I read legs,
but use a tough boss that he gravity,

105
00:04:57,551 --> 00:04:59,130
stomach backup and sorta held the.

106
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:01,510
Implies the end.
The bull actually died.

107
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:05,890
He climbed down out of the trade,
ended up dawn two times,

108
00:05:05,891 --> 00:05:09,020
I think once in the air because the 
royal flying doctors come in,

109
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,320
grabbed him because he's a long way out 
in the middle of nowhere.

110
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:17,070
And uh,
and once on the tables operating table 

111
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:19,951
as well.
He survived all that and ended up dying 

112
00:05:19,951 --> 00:05:19,951
of a bloody mess.
Heart attack.

113
00:05:19,951 --> 00:05:20,610
So no way.
Yeah.

114
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,860
When,
uh,

115
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,180
it was on the thing,
he was only 36 or 37.

116
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,360
Do you think it had anything to do with 
the that I reckon it was related at all 

117
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,870
really?
You would think that a guy could get 

118
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:34,990
past getting gored by pushes guts back 
into,

119
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:38,680
I'm not going to get a heart attack.
That's life's not fair.

120
00:05:38,681 --> 00:05:40,510
Right?
That's crazy.

121
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:41,650
Oh,
thank you.

122
00:05:41,651 --> 00:05:46,651
Jamie.
I think it was adjusting my shoot 

123
00:05:46,651 --> 00:05:48,850
license card as well.
If you don't have shoelaces,

124
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,170
you got those fat tires.
It's a little in the weeds like those.

125
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:56,170
Everyone asked me about my boots,
I'll get a glimpse of me,

126
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,070
whatever shoes I'm wearing,
my

127
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,930
shoot some awesome animal and they're 
like,

128
00:05:59,931 --> 00:06:03,420
what shoes you're wearing?
People are gearheads.

129
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,160
That's a big thing about hunting is how 
many people are like crazy gearheads 

130
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:09,220
like what?
You want to know,

131
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,850
what kind of bow you have,
what kind of,

132
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:14,020
what sites do you run in?
Like what kind of load of old.

133
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:17,330
It's really interesting to me maybe 
because I've done it for so long,

134
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:21,200
but I sort of don't care about the gears
as long as it works,

135
00:06:21,201 --> 00:06:22,640
as good as it should,
you know,

136
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:27,700
and that's because everyone asks me to 
keep doing these tip things as well and 

137
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:27,710
I hate doing that.
I hate listening to them.

138
00:06:27,711 --> 00:06:30,420
But if you're a new guy coming into 
bowhunting,

139
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,640
then obviously you want to know.
Some people love that stuff man.

140
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:38,650
Like John Dudley's tips that he does,
like he does these live instagram and 

141
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:43,001
youtube,
but facebook feeds or he'll like take a 

142
00:06:43,001 --> 00:06:45,621
bow apart,
put it back together again and explain 

143
00:06:45,621 --> 00:06:46,940
the cam systems are extreme with it to 
Hayes Hayes.

144
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,670
My go to guy,
if I don't know something that I'm doing

145
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:53,240
that's I'll go straight to Dudley.
Dudley is podcasts.

146
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:58,260
If you're into archery is called knock 
on is the knock on podcast is without a 

147
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:03,221
doubt the most in depth archery podcast 
from not just hunting from a hunting 

148
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:06,200
standpoint but from just target archery.
How,

149
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,210
you know,
how important technique is.

150
00:07:08,211 --> 00:07:13,211
I mean he's a real master.
He loves it and he's a super geared to 

151
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:14,630
eight years.
Has Your,

152
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:18,140
has your cyber October going crazy?
It's going good.

153
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:19,940
The sober part's easy.
The uh,

154
00:07:19,941 --> 00:07:24,941
the hot yoga,
we're in the homestretch today was a 

155
00:07:24,941 --> 00:07:24,941
number 13,
so I got two more.

156
00:07:24,941 --> 00:07:28,841
I'm banging them out this week.
I'm going to do tomorrow and Friday and 

157
00:07:28,841 --> 00:07:28,880
be done with it because I want to get 
back to doing other stuff.

158
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:33,881
And when you do a 90 minute yoga class,
it's hard to live weights or run or do 

159
00:07:33,981 --> 00:07:34,430
anything else.

160
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,720
You don't really want to do anything 
else,

161
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:38,060
you know,
so I'm just going to bang it out and get

162
00:07:38,061 --> 00:07:40,450
it over with.
Kim's done at once and she recommends.

163
00:07:40,451 --> 00:07:45,451
It was like hell on just the yoga.
I think she had a big drinking session 

164
00:07:46,281 --> 00:07:50,900
before she was in Bali and she just made
some stupid promise,

165
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:56,760
bolonaise woman.
And then the fifth bolonaise woman's 

166
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:56,760
ringing her up the next morning.
Like,

167
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,850
where are you if a yoga came,
just thought it was yoga though.

168
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,050
So she's like,
ah,

169
00:08:00,051 --> 00:08:05,051
I can do yoga in my sleep.
And she gets here and it's like in this 

170
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:05,060
hot room and stuff.
And it might.

171
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,770
It was killing us.
Bali too.

172
00:08:06,771 --> 00:08:08,180
I would imagine.
It's very humid,

173
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,770
humid.
It'd be Muggy as hell.

174
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:12,190
Ari was talking about that today because
our,

175
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:17,191
he does yoga in New York,
which is way more humid than it is in 

176
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:17,620
California.

177
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,930
California is dry,
so he was probably loving.

178
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:21,860
I just.
Oh yeah.

179
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:27,450
We went to a different place today.
Today we went to a place that was more 

180
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:27,860
mild,
so not as hot,

181
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,840
but um,
it's not,

182
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,820
it's your body gets used to it.
It's interesting.

183
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,430
It's like there's a lot like,
uh,

184
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:36,410
you know,
I do that cryotherapy style you like did

185
00:08:36,411 --> 00:08:40,310
it to yesterday for the first time in 
about three weeks I guess.

186
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,400
And it was hard.
Whereas I do it when I do it everyday.

187
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:45,890
It's not conditioned to it.
You just get in there and I do,

188
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,920
but it's,
it's quick how that conditioning goes 

189
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:50,920
away.
Yeah.

190
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,020
I hate to just say the peak tufts that I
did,

191
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,180
it was pretty bad job of said to them 
yet,

192
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:54,200
here's are cutters.
No,

193
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:55,980
I've never killed a bar.
Going to kill the

194
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:57,810
cells.
You need to come to Australia.

195
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,440
I do,
but I'm scared to be honest with you.

196
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:06,830
Every time I look at your instagram feed
and I see a brown snake that can kill 

197
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:07,990
you or a spider that can kill your 
fucking saltwater crocodiles.

198
00:09:07,991 --> 00:09:12,991
What are you doing?
Playing with crocodiles the other day 

199
00:09:12,991 --> 00:09:12,991
were coming into camp.
Dude.

200
00:09:12,991 --> 00:09:14,790
There was a couple of,
I wish I captured it on video.

201
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,090
It was one that she,
I think it was a female anyway,

202
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,750
she must've been coming around the back 
of camp unnoticed.

203
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,560
So the windshield was heading back to 
the water.

204
00:09:22,561 --> 00:09:25,860
She was literally come and strike 
through camp to get back into the water.

205
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:28,560
And you could,
is that thing.

206
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:31,170
That photo doesn't do that thing.
Justice.

207
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:33,930
That photo scares the shit out of me.
That's a real.

208
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:37,170
That's a real live monster out there.
How big was that fucker?

209
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:40,630
He's about five and a half meters.
Whoa.

210
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,810
He's giant.
He's always,

211
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:45,190
you can even see it in the picture of 
his body's just a real log crawl.

212
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:50,240
Five and a half meters to Americans.
I want you to take about 15 feet marco 

213
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:51,530
days.
Um,

214
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,210
so a few people have been taken at this 
spot.

215
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:58,620
Mostly indigenous had been grabbed.
Granted that spot over the years.

216
00:09:58,621 --> 00:10:01,000
And when you see an ancient piece like 
that,

217
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:02,760
there's a chance.
He's a man eater.

218
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:03,630
Yeah,
yeah,

219
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,790
yeah.
They just ruthless.

220
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:06,900
I like.
How old do you think?

221
00:10:06,901 --> 00:10:11,901
A 15 and a half foot crocodile is.
I don't want to comment because I don't 

222
00:10:11,901 --> 00:10:16,611
know and I'll probably get it wrong.
I would like to know like how long does 

223
00:10:16,611 --> 00:10:16,611
it take them to grow?
15 and a half feet.

224
00:10:16,611 --> 00:10:21,501
So if you could find that Jamie 
Saltwater CROC and I'm pretty sure that 

225
00:10:21,501 --> 00:10:21,501
I believe over a hundred years.
Yeah,

226
00:10:21,501 --> 00:10:21,840
they,
they live a long time,

227
00:10:21,841 --> 00:10:22,150
right?

228
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,040
Yeah.
So he's ruthless to like people who live

229
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,990
in Florida don't get those confused with
alligators.

230
00:10:27,991 --> 00:10:30,060
Yeah,
there are different completely different

231
00:10:30,061 --> 00:10:35,061
animals.
So we've got the freshwater crocodile 

232
00:10:35,061 --> 00:10:36,060
which just lives in fresh water.
Then we've got the salt water crocodile,

233
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,720
but he leaves in both,
you know.

234
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,780
And so a lot of people get that 
confused.

235
00:10:39,781 --> 00:10:41,130
I call it's fresh water.
I'll be right there.

236
00:10:41,131 --> 00:10:42,390
Go for a swim.
Uh,

237
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:45,000
no.
So the fresh water crocodiles and not as

238
00:10:45,001 --> 00:10:46,500
aggressive.
They're not aggressive.

239
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:51,530
They might get a bit territorial,
but they're not going to grab you to 

240
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:51,660
eight.
Whereas the Saudi will grab you to a.

241
00:10:51,661 --> 00:10:56,661
He just looked like.
And they keep growing throughout their 

242
00:10:56,661 --> 00:10:58,701
lifespan,
require more and more food with the 

243
00:10:58,701 --> 00:10:58,701
amount.
When the amount of food is unavailable,

244
00:10:58,701 --> 00:11:02,511
they die from starvation.
And the reason why you don't see a 

245
00:11:02,511 --> 00:11:02,511
thousand year old crocodiles that are 50
feet long.

246
00:11:02,511 --> 00:11:03,570
Wow.
That's the only reason.

247
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:07,560
Holy Shit.
The way they died of starvation or as if

248
00:11:07,561 --> 00:11:09,810
they contracted disease.
Oh my God.

249
00:11:09,811 --> 00:11:11,760
They just keep growing.
So that's why they.

250
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:15,510
That's why these ones in captivity,
because they get hand fed.

251
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,060
Yeah,
probably get the biggest.

252
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,990
That's where you'll see your biggest 
crux.

253
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:22,860
The Guinness Book of World Records,
the Saltwater Crocodile Cotton Australia

254
00:11:22,861 --> 00:11:26,040
as the largest crocodile in captivity 
measures 17 feet,

255
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,560
11 point seven,
five inches.

256
00:11:28,561 --> 00:11:31,470
So basically 18 feet.
That's huge.

257
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,350
So that my body,
my body,

258
00:11:34,351 --> 00:11:39,060
Andrew Equals.
Have you heard of your ankles?

259
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,040
No habit.
Oh,

260
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:42,870
he's,
he's like a youtube sensation.

261
00:11:42,871 --> 00:11:47,871
He's been captured in just about 
everything in Australia for the last 

262
00:11:47,871 --> 00:11:48,990
millennium.
And um,

263
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:54,800
he's,
he's seen a six w made a crocodile 

264
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:54,800
before.
When he's one of these guys.

265
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,891
You don't bullshit.
Like if he says he's seen a six meter 

266
00:11:58,891 --> 00:11:58,891
crocodile,
he's seen a six meter crocodile.

267
00:11:58,891 --> 00:12:02,810
Yeah.
Well that's just the biggest one in 

268
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:02,810
captivity.

269
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:02,810
Right?
So that's probably,

270
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:02,890
and Australia has a ton of food.
Tons of food.

271
00:12:02,891 --> 00:12:04,100
Yeah.
So it's not like this,

272
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,280
this starved to death.
This river system.

273
00:12:06,281 --> 00:12:10,300
We went down there fishing and we've 
probably traveled an hour down the river

274
00:12:10,301 --> 00:12:15,301
and a little tinny little boat.
I reckon we've seen 200 to 250 salt 

275
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:19,540
water crocodiles in that time.
She's like,

276
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:24,630
because like they can't harvest them or 
they don't call me out or anything like 

277
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:24,630
that.
Did.

278
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,950
There are laws protecting them so there 
is as low as protecting them.

279
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:31,980
So that's why the place is just riddled 
with them at mathematical laws 

280
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:32,370
protecting them.
It sounds like they're on posted.

281
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:36,250
Well anything that's a night even 
Australia is protected.

282
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:38,350
So like you guys,
you know how you can hunt,

283
00:12:38,351 --> 00:12:40,420
you're white tailed deer and everything 
like that.

284
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,510
Australia can't hunt Kangaroos,
you can't hunt any native.

285
00:12:43,511 --> 00:12:47,760
So everything we hunting is an 
introduced species and native.

286
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:52,060
So you can't hunt them and there's been 
talk about bringing in like a program.

287
00:12:52,061 --> 00:12:53,800
But I don't know if it will happen but 
that's,

288
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:55,910
that's so weird.
Yeah,

289
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:59,290
it seems to me to be very strange.
It's like completely different system.

290
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:04,291
Yeah,
but it makes sense that you guys hunt 

291
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:06,400
all the non native species because 
they're invasive and devastate the wild,

292
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:11,430
the land and the other wildlife.
Like you guys have crazy problems with 

293
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:13,360
feral cats.
We talked about that before and you know

294
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:16,720
that you have pigs everywhere and nyman 
donkeys,

295
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:22,110
horses,
even the funny ones that people don't 

296
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:22,110
think about like donkeys,
wild horses,

297
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,110
camels.
I think camels probably get a little bit

298
00:13:23,111 --> 00:13:25,570
of exposure.
Then we'll go to all your typical stuff.

299
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,410
You know,
pigs,

300
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,720
goats,
we've got the 60 years bcs.

301
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:32,020
So if we didn't have any of those 
introduced species,

302
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,760
we.
There'd be no hunting in Australia.

303
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,310
So what but what do they say?
That sounds nuts.

304
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:39,460
So they're only hunting just to get rid 
of the invasive species?

305
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:44,630
That's correct.
How do they control the populations of 

306
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:45,340
the Kangaroos or you can get like a 
permit.

307
00:13:45,341 --> 00:13:47,620
I couldn't as a bow hunter or just a 
hunter,

308
00:13:47,621 --> 00:13:52,621
couldn't get a permit,
but if you're a professional shooter 

309
00:13:52,621 --> 00:13:53,980
lucky shooting for human consumption or 
petmate or something like that,

310
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:59,250
or if you're a big land owner,
you can get like a tag or permits to 

311
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:03,250
shoot Kangaroos then every now and then 
to be an organized coal because they let

312
00:14:03,251 --> 00:14:05,580
them get so far out of control that 
they,

313
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,230
they eat the ground down to just pretty 
much.

314
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:13,530
Then they lie around and die a slow 
death of a couple of months because I 

315
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:13,820
lose nutrition,
you know,

316
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,910
they've weakened,
they don't move and it's obviously,

317
00:14:15,911 --> 00:14:17,890
it's a bit very painful way for to go.

318
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,350
Once it gets to that point,
it seems like they like,

319
00:14:20,351 --> 00:14:21,610
oh,
we need to do a column now.

320
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:23,710
So it,
all it is,

321
00:14:23,711 --> 00:14:26,080
is we've spoken about these people were 
for the greenies,

322
00:14:26,081 --> 00:14:31,081
you know,
these people that really don't have a 

323
00:14:31,081 --> 00:14:34,020
good picture on it and see that uh,
Carl or hunting program is actually 

324
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,910
better welfare for the animals because 
they stay healthier and in check.

325
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:37,540
Well they,
yeah.

326
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:39,480
They don't have any predators.
Exactly.

327
00:14:39,481 --> 00:14:41,590
Yeah.
Some places got wild dogs and Dingos,

328
00:14:41,591 --> 00:14:42,910
but that's about it.
Yeah.

329
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,880
And how many dingoes can take out a 
kangaroo.

330
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,830
Kangaroos get pretty goddamn bad.
Yeah,

331
00:14:47,831 --> 00:14:48,370
they do.
Yeah,

332
00:14:48,371 --> 00:14:49,660
they do.
They take them out,

333
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:51,290
they try and take down buffalo and 
stuff.

334
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:52,610
But they are.
They really?

335
00:14:52,611 --> 00:14:54,260
Yeah.
I don't think they very successful.

336
00:14:54,261 --> 00:14:56,540
They'd pick off a pig or a pig.
Little something like that.

337
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,130
Yeah man,
you know,

338
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:04,150
it's just,
I just don't understand why they would 

339
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:06,630
not try to keep the crocodiles and check
if you've seen it.

340
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:11,690
Hundreds and hundreds of crocodiles like
that because one of those things gonna 

341
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:12,260
eat what's going on here.
Jamie says in Malaysia,

342
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:17,950
a CROC shut up in front of somebody's 
shop and they were trying to get rid of 

343
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:21,761
it and they apparently don't know how 
people have held a month ago and while 

344
00:15:22,371 --> 00:15:23,750
they have helmets and maybe they're 
going to hit,

345
00:15:23,751 --> 00:15:28,751
but it take.
The guy's got a gaffe was what is he 

346
00:15:28,751 --> 00:15:28,970
going to do here?
Is trying to throw a tarp on it.

347
00:15:28,971 --> 00:15:31,370
So they called Jesus Christ like a bad 
idea.

348
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,370
This is hilarious.
They're all wearing Camo.

349
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:35,320
Uh,
but why are they wearing red camera?

350
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,300
Or it might be the fireman.
I think it looks like truck right there.

351
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,920
But why the firemen were like,
what do they blending into?

352
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,250
Let's go right in it.
That's a uniform.

353
00:15:43,251 --> 00:15:46,160
You think they got their helmets on?
Put that helmet.

354
00:15:46,161 --> 00:15:51,161
Looks like a motorcycle helmet.
A different country captain diversity 

355
00:15:53,211 --> 00:15:55,340
over here.
Jamie Vernon and big data.

356
00:15:55,341 --> 00:15:57,650
That's a good size.
Big fucker.

357
00:15:57,651 --> 00:16:00,700
And he's got his mouth open to like,
he's like,

358
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,850
bitch,
I'll kill you all this gary,

359
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:04,520
I,
oh,

360
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:07,850
they're so different.
Like I grew up when I was,

361
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,250
when I grew up actually,
but I lived there for three years.

362
00:16:10,251 --> 00:16:12,890
I lived in Gainesville,
Florida and when I lived there,

363
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:16,370
alligators were protected.
They used to be protected and we used to

364
00:16:16,371 --> 00:16:21,371
go to this place called Lake Alice and 
we would throw marshmallows and the 

365
00:16:21,371 --> 00:16:21,371
water and the alligators would come up 
and eat the marshmallows.

366
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,380
But then they start snatching people's 
dogs.

367
00:16:23,381 --> 00:16:26,750
I remember this one lady freaked out one
snatcher dogs just pull it right off her

368
00:16:26,751 --> 00:16:30,650
leash and she freaked out and that 
started happening more and more.

369
00:16:30,651 --> 00:16:35,651
And then the population got denser and 
denser one point in time they were 

370
00:16:35,651 --> 00:16:36,410
endangered.
Now they're infested.

371
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,840
Now there's so many alligators that 
they.

372
00:16:38,841 --> 00:16:43,841
Have you ever seen that show swamp 
people that show where they go hunting 

373
00:16:43,841 --> 00:16:43,841
for alligators,
which you know,

374
00:16:43,841 --> 00:16:45,680
people make purses and shoes and shit 
out of them.

375
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:50,950
They get 500 tags,
$500 so they can chew 500 fucking 

376
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:54,050
allocated just to keep the population 
healthy.

377
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:58,160
And the food is apparently very good.
The tail meat is apparently delicious.

378
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:01,420
I think Benny I brought in was just down
there somewhere,

379
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:06,730
maybe a month back down there and now 
like my set of line and hook them and 

380
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:12,310
taking a haven meet.
Obviously the girl off the skins and 

381
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:12,310
things like that.

382
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:12,660
The leather of the skins,
the meat is very good.

383
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:15,090
Dudley handsome.
He bow haunts him every year.

384
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,840
He goes to Orlando outside of Orlando.
I'd like to be pretty cool.

385
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,160
That'd be pretty cool.
Well,

386
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:22,280
they taste good too.
And they're in.

387
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:27,300
It's a conservation thing too because 
it's like you really do need to control 

388
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:27,300
their population.

389
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,240
Yeah.
Australia needs to get to that point.

390
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:33,290
What?
What's happening now is they're pushing 

391
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:33,290
into domestic waters,
you know,

392
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:33,610
like Darwin,
the cds,

393
00:17:33,611 --> 00:17:35,360
like build around,
you know,

394
00:17:35,361 --> 00:17:40,361
a big,
big river being lit or a big water 

395
00:17:40,991 --> 00:17:45,991
system and the guys would go swim in 
there and get taken all the time and I 

396
00:17:45,991 --> 00:17:47,350
will people's dogs jumping and they get 
taken.

397
00:17:47,351 --> 00:17:49,800
I think I've seen a video,
I don't know if it was Darwin

398
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,950
or where it was,
but um,

399
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:56,990
some lady's filming and then just say 
the back of a crock go on the luck of 

400
00:17:56,990 --> 00:18:01,791
jetty and then the,
the face of the crop comes out and it's 

401
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:02,590
got a full size domestic dog and its 
jaws.

402
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:08,730
It was imagined saying that how creepy 
side it was swimming in a river system.

403
00:18:08,731 --> 00:18:09,440
Like a,
like a,

404
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:12,340
seems like a,
like some sort of aqua doctors.

405
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,020
Crazy.
I big dog today.

406
00:18:16,021 --> 00:18:18,510
Just it runs like,
you know,

407
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:23,600
everyone talks about big foot.
This is the one Jesus look at the color 

408
00:18:24,751 --> 00:18:25,950
on it.
God,

409
00:18:25,951 --> 00:18:28,110
that thing is so big,
like fluffy.

410
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,600
That is a monster.
Just a straight up.

411
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:32,520
I mean,
what are they like?

412
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,640
I think they're more than 30 million 
years old.

413
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,010
Yeah,
I think I really,

414
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:39,540
I don't think they've changed in 30 plus
million years.

415
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:44,541
I think they just look at everything as 
potentially food and that's where the 

416
00:18:44,701 --> 00:18:46,530
risk is and that's the assignment.

417
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:48,660
If it's assigned with a big grizzly 
bear,

418
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:53,661
you know,
they just look at everything as a va 

419
00:18:53,661 --> 00:18:54,630
danger so they feel frightened and want 
to attack it or it's food.

420
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,510
Have you ever seen Jim shockey's show?
You know,

421
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,660
that show uncharted that he does?
Yep.

422
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:02,250
Have yet jim shockey's uncharted one of 
them ones.

423
00:19:02,251 --> 00:19:04,740
He went to Africa and I think it was the
Congo,

424
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,230
um,
I think it was the Congo River,

425
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,810
south of the Congo River,
I don't know.

426
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:12,960
Anyway,
it was a river and this,

427
00:19:12,961 --> 00:19:16,440
a native population that lived there.
These villagers,

428
00:19:16,441 --> 00:19:21,441
they lived right on the river banks and 
they were just getting taken left and 

429
00:19:21,441 --> 00:19:24,890
riper crocodiles.
Everyone in the village had like an arm 

430
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:27,060
missing or chunk cut out of their head.
Is this sit right here?

431
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:28,590
Jim shockey,
Mozambique,

432
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,670
Mozambique.
There we go.

433
00:19:29,671 --> 00:19:31,900
Thank you.
And Jim shockey's.

434
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,630
Just amazing.
But these things,

435
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:34,830
look at what they got here.

436
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:37,020
One of them was feasting on some sort of
an animal.

437
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:38,250
See,
look at these guys.

438
00:19:38,251 --> 00:19:43,251
They all have like a,
a stump where their arm is and there's 

439
00:19:43,251 --> 00:19:47,061
Jim and so they wanted to bring in 
professional hunters to try to help 

440
00:19:47,491 --> 00:19:52,491
control the population because they were
actively targeting the people that live 

441
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:52,530
there.
And these people,

442
00:19:52,531 --> 00:19:53,880
I mean they,
they live in a very small,

443
00:19:53,881 --> 00:19:57,630
very primitive village and all they have
is the water.

444
00:19:57,631 --> 00:19:59,250
I mean,
that's where they're getting their water

445
00:19:59,251 --> 00:20:04,251
from,
which it off is about to fucking make 

446
00:20:04,251 --> 00:20:04,251
the kill shot.
Youtube glitch was fucking.

447
00:20:04,251 --> 00:20:04,380
Oh,
really?

448
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:06,030
Kept flashing.
What is that?

449
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,230
I needed to refresh it.
It was just,

450
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,700
it happens on youtube from time to time 
on,

451
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:12,460
on the computer or normal.
Just normal.

452
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,440
Yeah,
just the browser.

453
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:18,560
But um,
it just does the poor people that lived 

454
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:18,560
there.
I mean,

455
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:18,820
you just got to imagine if this is your 
only play.

456
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:21,000
These people aren't traveling.
They don't have cars.

457
00:20:21,001 --> 00:20:22,680
They don't have.
They're not flying anywhere.

458
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:27,950
This is where they live.
They have to build these sort of fences 

459
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:31,880
around these little tiny bays.
They build these small makeshift fences 

460
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:36,940
to try to protect themselves from the 
crocodiles when they clean,

461
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:41,970
they clean their food or gather water or
wash their clothes once that risk every 

462
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,060
day.
Fuck.

463
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:46,500
This is one of the reasons why I do 
these radical hunts because it makes you

464
00:20:46,501 --> 00:20:48,030
realize how good we've got it,
right?

465
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:53,070
Yeah.
Like a like we just go to the tap and 

466
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:53,760
turn the tap on and we get water or if 
you want to share her a bath,

467
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:58,770
it's in the comfort of your own house.
These people are just trying to get 

468
00:20:58,770 --> 00:20:58,770
water to drink and they.
They could get snatched.

469
00:20:58,770 --> 00:20:59,860
Well,
people have been snatched.

470
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:04,880
Isn't that ridiculous?
And that's their life and there's no 

471
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,531
other life.
They know that their ancestors had been 

472
00:21:07,531 --> 00:21:07,531
there and their grandparents had been 
there.

473
00:21:07,531 --> 00:21:09,490
Their fathers had been there,
their mothers and now them.

474
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:14,570
And this is life.
That's why anytime someone complains 

475
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:15,430
about Australia or it in theU ,
s or whatever,

476
00:21:15,431 --> 00:21:15,970
it's like,
dude,

477
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:21,190
fuck.
Go look at what you have got so easy.

478
00:21:21,191 --> 00:21:22,780
Isn't it crazy?
It's so crazy.

479
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:27,781
I mean,
I was watching your instagram feed when 

480
00:21:27,781 --> 00:21:29,311
you were taking water or this buffalo 
wallow and throwing it through a filter 

481
00:21:29,311 --> 00:21:29,311
and put it in.

482
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:34,320
Now when you're a bit concerned about 
that because I like when I looked into 

483
00:21:34,991 --> 00:21:36,440
the filter,
just even video.

484
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:41,470
Is that on your instagram?
It might be still alive on the 

485
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:41,470
instagram.
It's on normal.

486
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:45,360
So normal instagram normally go to cvs 
because that way we could see.

487
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:50,400
So to start as I moved probably 200 
buffalo off that water hall and like a 

488
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,140
couple of mobs of pigs that were all 
like they go and ride out into the water

489
00:21:53,141 --> 00:21:58,141
and try and cool off.
He has a least one big salt water 

490
00:21:58,141 --> 00:22:01,321
crocodile in there as well,
but I'm walking out there with that bag 

491
00:22:01,321 --> 00:22:01,321
to you by yourself?
Yeah,

492
00:22:01,321 --> 00:22:02,680
I'm by myself.
Correct.

493
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,590
And I'm sleeping in a little cloth 
house.

494
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,720
Yeah.
I have a guys back in camp,

495
00:22:07,721 --> 00:22:12,721
but I was just down in the hunt,
Wyoming so that it just said this was 

496
00:22:12,721 --> 00:22:12,721
pretty new.

497
00:22:12,721 --> 00:22:12,721
I didn't know if it was older.
Yeah,

498
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,940
I think it's it and yeah.
Yeah,

499
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:20,970
yeah.
I'm barefoot walking up to the water 

500
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:22,380
with this pumps.
I'm going look at this.

501
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:23,870
Look at this.
Look at.

502
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:28,890
This is a big frigging buffalo to 
sitting right there in the water that's 

503
00:22:29,441 --> 00:22:34,441
old for the water.
Do not drink and then frigging dehydrate

504
00:22:35,111 --> 00:22:37,390
and die out there.
But you drink and Turd water.

505
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:40,200
Yeah.
That's why I hope the field to work.

506
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,310
Now,
how do these filters work?

507
00:22:42,311 --> 00:22:43,120
How does that.
Well,

508
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:46,720
they claim to filter out 99 point nine,
nine,

509
00:22:46,721 --> 00:22:47,210
nine,
nine,

510
00:22:47,211 --> 00:22:49,860
nine percent of all the germs.
It's zero,

511
00:22:49,861 --> 00:22:50,400
zero,
zero,

512
00:22:50,401 --> 00:22:50,960
zero.
One.

513
00:22:50,961 --> 00:22:55,420
It's going to fuck you or something on 
the edge of the bag that runs down,

514
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,640
you know,
that's probably going to get you.

515
00:22:57,641 --> 00:23:02,641
But um,
how often do you get beaver fever when 

516
00:23:02,641 --> 00:23:02,641
you do?
I've never been,

517
00:23:02,641 --> 00:23:04,810
I've never been sick from drinking water
out in the Bush or eating.

518
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:07,150
That's any of the meat or anything like 
that.

519
00:23:07,151 --> 00:23:08,080
Never ever,
ever,

520
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:10,540
ever talked to dad,
spends time in the bush,

521
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:13,220
gets sick.
How have you not gotten anybody?

522
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:16,090
Andrea equals.
And He seems like a pretty hardy dude.

523
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:17,560
And he's like,
oh,

524
00:23:17,561 --> 00:23:18,700
so have you had this?
And I'm like,

525
00:23:18,701 --> 00:23:19,590
no,
have you had this?

526
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:20,190
I'm like,
no,

527
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:22,990
have you had this?
Like not nearly died from this.

528
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,710
I'm like,
what?

529
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:26,020
I've had none of those.
And I've drank.

530
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,540
There was one time I was so desperate 
for water.

531
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:33,541
This has gone back to when I was like,
looks like actually it looks all right.

532
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,890
It looks pretty good.
Taste off the filter.

533
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,910
The water tastes like Piss piss and I'm 
like,

534
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:45,060
shouldn't have that filter because the 
taste is obviously something but it's 

535
00:23:46,131 --> 00:23:51,131
still piss.
It's still paced but it's probably 

536
00:23:51,131 --> 00:23:53,921
actually really good for you.
Drinking is good friend with Duke in 

537
00:23:53,921 --> 00:23:53,921
that water.

538
00:23:53,921 --> 00:23:55,010
Do you put like a c?
You've got a mountain ops bottle.

539
00:23:55,011 --> 00:23:58,280
Do you put some flavor in there?
Just to mask it a bit.

540
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:03,340
I think I'd run out at this point that 
was like 27 kilometer hike that day.

541
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,590
Um,
so you just deal with the taste.

542
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,390
Do you just deal with it and you know 
what,

543
00:24:08,391 --> 00:24:13,391
you're that first either.
It doesn't really bother you at the 

544
00:24:13,391 --> 00:24:13,391
time.
Well,

545
00:24:13,391 --> 00:24:14,840
when you did that epic hunt up here in 
cow in,

546
00:24:14,841 --> 00:24:17,090
um,
we were starting in Colorado.

547
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:19,310
Right.
And then you went to Idaho,

548
00:24:19,311 --> 00:24:24,311
Idaho,
but I didn't actually hunt Idaho across 

549
00:24:24,311 --> 00:24:24,311
through Idaho into the back of Montana.
Yeah.

550
00:24:24,311 --> 00:24:29,250
And trying to find a spot with limited 
hunters and more elk and we were all 

551
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:31,950
following you on instagram stories was a
tough haunt.

552
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:34,280
Those tapes that I left out of it and 
unlike,

553
00:24:34,281 --> 00:24:39,281
I'll just save this for Joe,
but well I got really sick like for like

554
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:45,550
they always just liquid coming out of 
frigging every you got sick from waters.

555
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:48,240
I don't want to admit that.
Hey,

556
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:51,770
you just said you never got because a 
couple of pit people writing me messages

557
00:24:51,771 --> 00:24:56,771
and like that's a good way to get sick.
And I'm like I've done these heaps as 

558
00:24:56,771 --> 00:24:57,590
long as you do.
And you drank red on the ground.

559
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:58,700
Oh yeah.
I actually,

560
00:24:58,701 --> 00:25:03,701
I ate some jerky that had been,
I left it in the tank and the tank got 

561
00:25:03,701 --> 00:25:04,430
really hot.
Like the start of the hunt.

562
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:06,350
It was the heat was soaring,
you know,

563
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:07,750
and the,
the,

564
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:09,800
he wouldn't be sweaty in that in the 
bag,

565
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:12,200
but I'll stop and so I'm like,
I'm just going to eat it.

566
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:15,670
And then it was nearly like two hours 
later that I was lucky.

567
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:20,790
I don't feel real good about 'em.
I've never been tent bound in me life 

568
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:21,800
and I'm just like not just keep 
haunting,

569
00:25:21,801 --> 00:25:22,520
don't worry about it.

570
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:26,390
So this is bad.
I probably shouldn't say it,

571
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:30,940
but I literally hunt for five minutes 
and have to pull me straight down,

572
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:36,400
you know,
and then go number twos and then walk 

573
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:36,400
for another five minutes and be like,
Oh fuck,

574
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:41,400
you know,
informed my brains out for a couple of 

575
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:41,400
days.
Two days,

576
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,880
two days.
I think that's because I lost 17 kilos.

577
00:25:43,881 --> 00:25:46,820
I reckon I lost 10 of them in them.
Couple of days.

578
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:49,340
What's that in pounds?
Seventeen kilos.

579
00:25:49,341 --> 00:25:50,600
It's a lot of pounds.
Thirty five.

580
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:56,400
Lost that much weight.
Yet I had my pants were falling off me 

581
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:56,400
dude.
Like,

582
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,790
like literally falling off me from being
taught on the to fallen off me.

583
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,940
So this was because you were hiking 
every day.

584
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,260
Just how I can everyday I w I hiked over
frowned,

585
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:05,330
remodels,
hold up for a hundred and 14 miles.

586
00:26:05,331 --> 00:26:07,340
I think it was all up 22 days.

587
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:11,570
That's so crazy.
That's limited food and um,

588
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:14,300
you know,
maybe that bad jerky helped as well.

589
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:19,610
So I'm going to start a weight loss 
program or my friend Burke.

590
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:22,370
It did a yoga today.
He's obsessed with you.

591
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:27,620
Is going to be on the podcast as well.
Kim sent me a link and she's like,

592
00:26:27,651 --> 00:26:29,660
you should have,
you should listen to this podcast.

593
00:26:29,661 --> 00:26:32,300
And I listened to it and he's like,
I feel like I could be friends with that

594
00:26:32,301 --> 00:26:33,740
dude.
And I'm like,

595
00:26:33,741 --> 00:26:34,490
yeah,
we can be friends.

596
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:37,490
Then he put frigging on Instagram,
some dude trying to milk.

597
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,220
He's nibbles and we can't be fucking 
friends,

598
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:47,360
but he's won me back either because he'd
done that hilarious video if you dance 

599
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,280
in the dialogue was crying.
Yeah,

600
00:26:50,281 --> 00:26:52,020
we did our uh,
13th.

601
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:55,950
He and I did our 13th yoga class today 
and Ren Tom are on number 14.

602
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:57,600
Two more to go for me.
One for logos.

603
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:01,030
Those two guys told at the homestretch,
but yeah,

604
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:04,590
nothing compared to 28 days in the bush.
It was good.

605
00:27:04,591 --> 00:27:07,050
I loved it.
I missed a lot of things.

606
00:27:07,051 --> 00:27:08,760
Like it makes you realize,
you know,

607
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:13,820
like I said how lucky we are off and,
and I've always been the person that 

608
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,780
doesn't take anything for granted 
anyway,

609
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:17,550
but it's just that,
you know,

610
00:27:17,551 --> 00:27:19,050
it really rings home,
you know,

611
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,410
the simple thing.
So you just just went out there.

612
00:27:22,411 --> 00:27:27,411
Look,
you didn't necessarily have a good area 

613
00:27:27,411 --> 00:27:27,411
that had been scouted out.
Definitely didn't have a good area,

614
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:32,420
but um,
met a real nice young dude actually 

615
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:35,631
messaged me for instagram at the time.
I could hardly get to any messages and 

616
00:27:35,631 --> 00:27:35,631
about.
Anyway,

617
00:27:35,631 --> 00:27:36,960
that was one that I read and he's like,
look,

618
00:27:36,961 --> 00:27:39,540
while you're in this unit,
he picked what unit is he in?

619
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:44,960
He's like,
come over to this area of hunter for 

620
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,030
pretty much my whole life.
And there's a few good bulls there.

621
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:48,450
Now the first day or the second day that
I was in there,

622
00:27:48,451 --> 00:27:52,320
I was saying three really good bulls and
that's what kept me there because I kept

623
00:27:52,321 --> 00:27:54,750
thinking I'm going to find them bulls 
again and I just cleaned off.

624
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:56,720
I just moved out of the area.
Um,

625
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:02,600
the whole idea of hunting in Colorado 
was because last year I had a couple of 

626
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,500
issues with grizzlies in Montana and 
doing saw law.

627
00:28:04,501 --> 00:28:09,501
I'm lucky you're a,
you're a decade if you do that again 

628
00:28:09,501 --> 00:28:10,260
because you got three young kids and a 
beautiful wife.

629
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:13,290
Like it's a big risk to take,
like I take risks,

630
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:15,290
but that's one that's out of my control.
You know,

631
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,220
grizzly going.
Yeah.

632
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:21,290
Yeah.
And so I kept trying to avoid that area 

633
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:21,290
and then when I wasn't fun in bulls,
like,

634
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:25,880
so I ended up moving out to Colorado,
went to Idaho and walked into the back 

635
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,750
of Montana where there's supposed to be 
less grizzlies.

636
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,240
And that's where I got charged by 
grizzly bears.

637
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:32,100
A lot of grizzlies and Montana.
Man,

638
00:28:32,101 --> 00:28:34,080
it's crazy.
They're out of control too.

639
00:28:34,081 --> 00:28:36,060
They just frigging like the crocs on dry
land.

640
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:39,110
You saw grizzlies in Colorado?
I did yet.

641
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:41,220
Oh,
this is the cutest thing.

642
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:44,370
I've caught so much flack over that.
Now you're positive.

643
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:47,350
These were grizzle hundred percent.
Now what does a black.

644
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:51,230
There's black bear in the same area and 
I nearly could do the comparison because

645
00:28:51,231 --> 00:28:56,231
it was a black bear there and it was a 
grizzly day saying the black bear first 

646
00:28:56,231 --> 00:28:56,231
and I'm like,
oh,

647
00:28:56,231 --> 00:28:57,330
this in.
You'll see the video.

648
00:28:57,331 --> 00:28:57,690
Like,
oh,

649
00:28:57,691 --> 00:28:59,280
there's a black bear over there.
That's pretty cool.

650
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:02,010
She's got cubs,
so I just want to try and avoid her.

651
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:04,900
Then looking at these Alpha Bayer and 
all this thing.

652
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:08,190
Grizzlies before this,
things that completely different beasts.

653
00:29:08,191 --> 00:29:09,600
There's no mistake in the two.

654
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:12,340
It's not like a.
that's just the.

655
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:16,050
That's a young looking Greasley that 
might tell it now.

656
00:29:16,051 --> 00:29:17,790
It looks like a big black bear.
No,

657
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:21,990
it's a frigging massive grizzly and 
compare it to a massive black bed.

658
00:29:21,991 --> 00:29:25,080
There's still a massive height 
difference and everything.

659
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:30,110
The big write up shoulders.
The big square head spotting scope with 

660
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:33,771
you.
Now I did not just have maybe been 

661
00:29:33,771 --> 00:29:34,820
oculus and 10,
40 two's 10 by 42 is the mavens yet.

662
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:38,150
So the same one too.
You got a good look at it.

663
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:39,090
Awesome.
Look,

664
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,250
but at that point I just figured,
Oh shit,

665
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:47,280
there is grizzlies in Colorado.
Just the couple of people that told me 

666
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,520
all you won't see grizzlies.
They just didn't know the area.

667
00:29:48,521 --> 00:29:49,900
Right.
So I didn't think much of it.

668
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:55,260
So I did the little film for the buyer 
knows and stuff like that and like 

669
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:55,260
there's a big Mama grizzly up there.

670
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,430
She's got carbs.
I definitely want to stay away from her.

671
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:03,030
Then I wanted the whole my ass out of 
that because that's an advice and I 

672
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:07,381
wanted the whole mindset of that Bison 
and not sleeping that base in for the 

673
00:30:07,381 --> 00:30:08,140
night.
So I've moved on pretty quick.

674
00:30:08,141 --> 00:30:09,880
Got to the top of the ridge,
looked at her again.

675
00:30:09,881 --> 00:30:11,530
She was fading along.
I'm like cool.

676
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,650
Then slept on the other side of the 
ridge.

677
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,960
Then come back through there in the 
morning,

678
00:30:16,961 --> 00:30:20,080
spotted her again in the morning,
kept walking out of there.

679
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:23,620
Then I got reception again and then I 
had a hit with messages.

680
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:25,450
There's not supposed to be an ingredient
leads in Colorado.

681
00:30:25,451 --> 00:30:26,500
I'm like,
fuck,

682
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,960
I just,
I just blew it off as in,

683
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,380
Oh,
there is grizzlies here.

684
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:31,690
Shit,
these guys got it wrong.

685
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:35,620
Not that it's a massive big deal and 
that is not supposed to be at all and no

686
00:30:35,621 --> 00:30:37,510
one wants to admit that there are there.

687
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:42,550
So this is a no one wants to admit it or
is it you were deep into the tree?

688
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:43,690
Yeah,
that as well.

689
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:48,040
So there's a multiple sightings in the 
area.

690
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:53,220
I don't want to say the area because 
next year I'm going to go back and 

691
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,891
document it with a decent camera and 
everything like that to try to get some 

692
00:30:55,891 --> 00:30:58,690
video of too and get some real good 
evidence and stuff like that.

693
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:04,020
So I haven't really spoken about a lot 
since then because I just got pounded 

694
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,560
with messages going,
there's no grizzlies in Colorado,

695
00:31:05,561 --> 00:31:07,090
you idiot.
What don't you want to tell?

696
00:31:07,091 --> 00:31:10,600
Like wildlife biologists or someone that
apparently they already know and I don't

697
00:31:10,601 --> 00:31:14,210
want to admit it because of the whole 
protected space.

698
00:31:14,211 --> 00:31:15,980
He's act and everything like that.
Well,

699
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:20,990
what does that mean though?
Why would they want to admit that 

700
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:20,990
there's bears there?

701
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:20,990
I think it might be a pain in the ass.
I don't know.

702
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:22,310
I don't understand.
I,

703
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,470
but I'm keen to get to the bottom of it.
You know,

704
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:29,490
it's sort of on this Yamaha.
I come back in there again and I'm going

705
00:31:31,241 --> 00:31:35,080
to try and get some good evidence,
but it seems to me that they would want.

706
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:40,180
I mean,
I don't understand why they would want 

707
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:40,180
to deny the existence,
not able to lie,

708
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:40,930
but a lot of people are saying this 
actually.

709
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:47,490
I think there's a website where it takes
in people's sightings and stuff like 

710
00:31:48,371 --> 00:31:52,360
that and all the sidings and the last 
grizzlies known in Colorado.

711
00:31:52,361 --> 00:31:54,790
We're all in this mountain range.
That probably gives a lot of it away.

712
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:57,130
But the San Jose San Jose mountain 
range.

713
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:57,970
It is.
Yeah.

714
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,910
But no,
it's massive.

715
00:32:00,911 --> 00:32:02,420
Like,
Oh God,

716
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:05,520
I'm not too worried.
All of the last sightings were there and

717
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,820
I think the last sightings were in the 
eighties,

718
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:11,080
maybe the early nineties there was 
grease Liza,

719
00:32:11,081 --> 00:32:13,150
and when you look at a map and you look 
at the range,

720
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,250
it's.
It'd be nothing for him to be there.

721
00:32:15,251 --> 00:32:17,930
Still was this bought new ones.
Walk in there.

722
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,000
There's grizzlies in Wyoming,
right?

723
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:21,420
Connected.
Yep.

724
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:26,790
So of course they're probably there.
Why do they think that you get up there 

725
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:28,300
and you have a look at this mountain 
range and as just 100 percent in grizzly

726
00:32:28,301 --> 00:32:29,180
country.
Oh,

727
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,360
that,
that one there.

728
00:32:31,361 --> 00:32:36,361
I'm the last sighting occurred in 2,600
independent pass officials investigated 

729
00:32:36,361 --> 00:32:39,680
but found nothing to 1979 bear had cubs 
are likely dead.

730
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,290
That's A.
is that a bear right there for that?

731
00:32:42,291 --> 00:32:44,450
They got on camera.
That's obviously a grizzly.

732
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:46,370
Yeah.
You could tell the difference.

733
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:51,550
I saw one in Alberta.
I've only seen one if that is a 

734
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:51,550
colleague.
Yeah.

735
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:53,830
This thing that I seen towel is over 
that,

736
00:32:53,831 --> 00:32:56,970
like we're talking about a fully mature 
Mava grizzly.

737
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,710
So you're talking about like a 10 foot 
bear.

738
00:32:58,711 --> 00:33:00,010
Yeah,
just a huge bear,

739
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:05,340
like there's no mistaking it.
This thing would windshields walk and 

740
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,850
you could see like she's out here like 
this,

741
00:33:07,851 --> 00:33:09,010
you know,
like had,

742
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:12,380
when I get big and mature you'll see 
they've got like a silver back on them,

743
00:33:12,381 --> 00:33:13,790
like a grip,
like a gorilla,

744
00:33:13,791 --> 00:33:15,460
you know,
they've got this silver back on him like

745
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:20,470
this,
like the last part of the hair goes 

746
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:20,470
silver.
She's that she's the right color,

747
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:22,220
the right shape,
the right size and everything.

748
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:22,550
So

749
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:27,680
hmm.
So you only saw her in her cubs or you 

750
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:27,680
saw more?

751
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,300
Her and her cubs and then Novalon 
there's a photo of another one that's 

752
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:33,821
just the cinnamon black bay are.
And I think a lot of few people got 

753
00:33:33,821 --> 00:33:34,070
confused and that's probably on my end 
from.

754
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:38,090
I just posted a story about a grizzly 
and then I had these other best shot

755
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:41,950
static results from 2011.
It says actually steamboat springs.

756
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,120
Yeah.
Okay.

757
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:47,920
That's Colorado.
Nearly look at that as a cinnamon phase.

758
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:50,400
Black Bay to go to a be wrong.
Go,

759
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:52,450
go.
Can you make that larger Jamie?

760
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:56,830
It's as big as it gets.
That might be a grizzly.

761
00:33:56,831 --> 00:33:57,580
Yeah,
it could be,

762
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:59,320
but yeah,
you might be right though.

763
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:01,330
That could be a collar phase.
Brown bear,

764
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:02,470
black bear rather

765
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:08,240
test looking at.
If it's a younger Greasley then maybe 

766
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:11,021
not.
But she had this frigging massive head 

767
00:34:11,021 --> 00:34:12,740
dude like flared out like this,
you know,

768
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:14,930
the big read on the back and

769
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:20,240
it'd be interesting if Adam Green tree 
was the one who proved that they're 

770
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,060
almost dry.
A grizzly bear was in Colorado,

771
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:26,390
but the point is there's very few people
that are going to the mountain ranges.

772
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:28,550
Like how far back were you from the 
trail head at?

773
00:34:28,551 --> 00:34:31,560
Well,
so I've wrote a really rough trail head

774
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:36,780
on a mountain bike for so far.
Then that trial pretty much disappeared 

775
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:39,490
out to nothing.
Then I hiked a full,

776
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:45,540
must've been seven hours because she was
like just before sundown.

777
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:50,790
So it would've been a good seven hours 
in the back then and that's because 

778
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:51,470
there was no elk that's going nonstop,
you know,

779
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:56,500
and if you watched the video run a lot 
of it because it was just what I call 

780
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:56,500
dead country,
you know,

781
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,020
there was not,
not really good looking hunting country.

782
00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:00,820
So you'll see me sort of trotting along 
most of it.

783
00:35:00,821 --> 00:35:05,170
So it was a long way back.
There was no human footprints up there.

784
00:35:05,171 --> 00:35:06,970
There was nothing like that.

785
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,700
Ten miles,
15 miles,

786
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,940
probably 60 miles I think it was.

787
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:17,100
So the odds of people going back there 
on a regular basis are probably pretty 

788
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:17,100
slim.
Very slim.

789
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,880
Yeah.
So they probably just don't know.

790
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:24,100
And now that that's one of the issues 
that apparently they're dealing with 

791
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:24,100
NBC,
you know,

792
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:28,320
in bc when you talk to the people that 
live there versus the people that are.

793
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,650
You know how BC has banned grizzly 
hunting.

794
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,330
Yeah.
The people that live in Greece,

795
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,680
BC are terrified of that now because 
they're like,

796
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:40,470
we to control these goddamn things.
Like you don't like what they say.

797
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:41,760
The people that I know that live up 
there,

798
00:35:41,761 --> 00:35:46,761
they say the wildlife biologists are 
rarely here like they need and the 

799
00:35:46,761 --> 00:35:48,630
hunters that people that live up there,
the outfitters,

800
00:35:48,631 --> 00:35:52,800
it's like you need to take like some 
sort of a census from us.

801
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:54,360
Boots on the ground ground.
Yeah,

802
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:54,990
that's right.
Yeah,

803
00:35:55,020 --> 00:36:00,020
and the way they describe it as like 
there was a greedy bowman did a podcast 

804
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:00,660
about this with one of the guys that 
lives up there,

805
00:36:00,661 --> 00:36:05,661
that's an outfitter,
and he was saying we encountered them 

806
00:36:05,661 --> 00:36:07,040
all the time and they're hyper 
aggressive like you,

807
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:10,380
you're talking about people.
These biologists that are rarely there.

808
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:15,690
There's not like any like really 
involved intricate census that they're 

809
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:19,440
doing with their go really in depth 
accounting of all the bears.

810
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:24,740
He's like,
you got to get information from the 

811
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:26,331
people that lived there and do.
They're going to tell you there's a lot 

812
00:36:26,331 --> 00:36:26,331
of them.

813
00:36:26,331 --> 00:36:26,331
Yup.
Yup.

814
00:36:26,331 --> 00:36:30,810
Well,
they're not smart enough to control 

815
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:32,331
their sales are because a lot of these 
people just want to sit back and just 

816
00:36:32,331 --> 00:36:32,331
let these animals do.

817
00:36:32,331 --> 00:36:33,100
Will do.
That's the idea.

818
00:36:33,101 --> 00:36:37,090
They want to do NBC.
They think that what they can do is,

819
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:42,180
I mean this is speculation,
but they think that what they can do is 

820
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:46,140
let the,
instead of let the people control the 

821
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:49,570
predators,
they think let the predators eat all the

822
00:36:49,571 --> 00:36:53,450
game that they can and then when they 
don't have enough food to,

823
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:55,390
populations are naturally going to 
diminish.

824
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:55,950
Yeah,
no,

825
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:59,100
I like the idea that ain't gonna work.
What can happen,

826
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:04,160
but it could take 50,
60 years and the problem is along that 

827
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,160
you're gonna get a lot of human death,
going to get a lot of pets.

828
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:08,480
You're gonna get a lot of animals that 
are going to invade into farmlands.

829
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:12,120
It just seems to me that that's not a 
wise way to handle it.

830
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:13,110
No,
definitely not.

831
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:18,200
And it's also they're going to have to 
pay money to kill problem bears and 

832
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:21,270
instead of making money,
but they don't like.

833
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:22,770
Look,
this whole Cecil,

834
00:37:22,771 --> 00:37:25,440
the lion thing,
I think fucked a lot of people up.

835
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,430
You know,
people.

836
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:31,460
The idea of some evil person just going 
over there and shooting some beloved 

837
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:35,121
animal.
That became the narrative and everybody 

838
00:37:35,121 --> 00:37:37,050
sort of has this idea in their head that
this is what bear hunting is.

839
00:37:37,051 --> 00:37:39,420
It's the same sort of thing.
We don't want that MPC.

840
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:40,830
No,
it's,

841
00:37:40,831 --> 00:37:45,831
it's,
it really is something that needs to be 

842
00:37:45,831 --> 00:37:47,901
discussed on both sides and I think both
sides have points when it comes to like 

843
00:37:47,901 --> 00:37:49,020
quote unquote trophy hunting,
you know?

844
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,060
Yeah,
yeah.

845
00:37:50,061 --> 00:37:55,061
I'm definitely not for one or the other.
It's not like we want to walk them off 

846
00:37:55,061 --> 00:37:56,240
the face of the planet.
We just want to see these healthy,

847
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:57,350
a healthy population

848
00:37:57,450 --> 00:38:02,450
and the people that live around there 
and a lot of them depend on moose meat 

849
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:04,900
and deer meat and these bear going to 
decimate the populations.

850
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:06,780
If they don't control the populations of
bear,

851
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:07,320
they will.

852
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:12,810
Something else has got to change.
They're going to decimate the game 

853
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:12,810
populations.
Yeah,

854
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:12,810
sure.
I don't,

855
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:17,640
I don't.
I actually think the areas that I hunt 

856
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:17,640
in Montana aren't overpopulated with 
grizzlies,

857
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:20,620
from what I've seen just populated.
They just populated.

858
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,300
So this,
the,

859
00:38:22,301 --> 00:38:25,840
the place that I ended up going into in 
Montana isn't my usual spot,

860
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:30,870
you know,
and there wasn't supposed to be as many 

861
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:32,341
grizzlies and that was,
you would have seen the video where I 

862
00:38:32,341 --> 00:38:36,120
walk over the rise and then all of a 
sudden we locked eyes at the same time 

863
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:40,590
and then she in a split second,
she just comes straight at me and I'll 

864
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:42,010
tell the story because he hates the 
people keep asking.

865
00:38:42,011 --> 00:38:47,011
But I'm uh,
I'm one of these people that I practice 

866
00:38:47,011 --> 00:38:49,110
with whatever I'm shooting with memory.
When the,

867
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:52,000
uh,
the free day leafy suits came out,

868
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:57,750
it was a,
like a camouflage suit and it had like 

869
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:57,750
free tea leaves on it hanging off it.

870
00:38:57,750 --> 00:39:02,580
And I like I got laughed at because I 
went to the archery range and shot in 

871
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:05,941
it.
And the first time I shot in the string 

872
00:39:05,941 --> 00:39:06,580
of the boat,
hit the leaves in my shirt was off.

873
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:08,770
So yeah,
Ghillie suit,

874
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,170
like just practice with whatever they 
use.

875
00:39:11,171 --> 00:39:15,370
And so my buddies,
a sheriff in Idaho,

876
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:18,450
he's gonna lend me a hand gun.
So he lends me to hang on.

877
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:23,460
Like dude,
I've never even tried to hang out and 

878
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:23,460
you just can't get them in Australia 
like that,

879
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:26,551
so I want to practice.
We went out and practiced and we 

880
00:39:26,551 --> 00:39:28,320
practiced with a cheaper bullet,
you know,

881
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:31,720
and it was like a solid solid bullet.
It was awesome.

882
00:39:31,721 --> 00:39:33,890
I picked it up straight away and there 
was no dramas.

883
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:37,030
I was a good shot with it.
Just trying to do a rashad thinking if a

884
00:39:37,031 --> 00:39:39,280
bear of a Getcha it's going to be in a 
rush.

885
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,760
It's not like these,
you know,

886
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:45,820
pull it,
pull the gun out and have a heap of 

887
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:47,640
time.
So I was practicing shooting with one 

888
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:47,640
hand and everything like that.
Anyway,

889
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:50,260
when it comes to going on the hunt,
he gave me some expense,

890
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:55,440
pensive bullets,
and now our hollow point with like a 

891
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,020
real flat front on it.
So we never shot those bullets.

892
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,550
Anyway,
this grizzly charged,

893
00:39:57,551 --> 00:40:01,420
I pulled the gun out,
she stopped at 20 meters the first time.

894
00:40:01,421 --> 00:40:03,280
Like I just try,
I stayed stationary,

895
00:40:03,281 --> 00:40:05,020
I didn't want to do any radical 
movements,

896
00:40:05,021 --> 00:40:07,740
but I just yelled at her.
She stopped at $20,000,000.

897
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:12,750
She turned back and went to a cub and at
this point I cubs just at the base of 

898
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:16,681
the tree.
She got there as soon as she's saying 

899
00:40:16,681 --> 00:40:19,231
that the cop was all right.
She just comes straight back at me 

900
00:40:19,231 --> 00:40:19,231
again,
like,

901
00:40:19,231 --> 00:40:20,680
like massive bear,
like rice and strike that made.

902
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:26,460
I had the handgun to the handguns out 
now because I pulled it out the first 

903
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:29,641
time.
This time she come all the way to 10 

904
00:40:29,641 --> 00:40:31,360
meters and I,
and I'll actually,

905
00:40:31,361 --> 00:40:33,760
I laid this out just for now,
just tell it how it went.

906
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:37,240
And I pulled the gun out.
I yelled at her again like that.

907
00:40:37,241 --> 00:40:39,280
She stopped,
she did a big swipe on the ground,

908
00:40:39,281 --> 00:40:41,520
spun and went straight back to the 
login.

909
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:44,860
See soon as she got back to the cob,
this time she rented a side load,

910
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:45,930
tried to flank me.
You know,

911
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:48,940
it freaks me out how fast these things 
can move.

912
00:40:48,941 --> 00:40:53,941
Like,
like you've seen our foster dad can get 

913
00:40:53,941 --> 00:40:54,570
off the mark I and agrees leads faster 
than the D or.

914
00:40:54,571 --> 00:40:59,571
And you think of the size of a grizzly 
and it can still move at the speed of a 

915
00:40:59,571 --> 00:40:59,700
deer or faster.

916
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,600
Like in.
She just disappears into this.

917
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,610
There's all this scrub beside me I can't
see.

918
00:41:03,611 --> 00:41:07,120
So I'm like standing there like,
like just white and where's she going to

919
00:41:07,121 --> 00:41:12,121
pop out?
Because I fought the third time she's 

920
00:41:12,121 --> 00:41:12,121
going to,
she ain't fucking around.

921
00:41:12,121 --> 00:41:15,470
She's going to try and kill me the third
time she never showed up and I stayed 

922
00:41:15,521 --> 00:41:17,800
there for a little while and just start 
backing up.

923
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:23,010
And that's what I've got the camera out 
because the other thing I'm fearful of 

924
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:27,330
is shooting one and not being able to 
justify it because you people go to 

925
00:41:27,330 --> 00:41:27,440
jail,
get massive fall.

926
00:41:27,441 --> 00:41:29,020
And so I'm like,
all want a document?

927
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,500
They started telling that she's coming 
album probably gonna pull the trigger.

928
00:41:32,501 --> 00:41:35,420
I want to document it anyway.
I back out.

929
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:39,110
She sort stalks along a little bit like 
watching me and stuff like that.

930
00:41:39,111 --> 00:41:44,090
Then she disappears and I walk away and 
then I realized the guns jammed.

931
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:47,690
The gun's been in that whole time and I 
was like,

932
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:50,060
let's say shit.
So she did come for me,

933
00:41:50,061 --> 00:41:55,061
like truly come from me.
I was fucked like there was no doubt 

934
00:41:55,061 --> 00:41:57,791
about what was going on in those hollow 
points with the flat face and I'm 

935
00:41:57,791 --> 00:41:58,100
wouldn't load up into the chamber of the
gun.

936
00:41:58,101 --> 00:42:02,090
They hit on the throat of the revolver 
and won't go up in there.

937
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:04,620
So you'd never would have gotten off a 
shot.

938
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:06,290
I would never would have gotten off a 
shot.

939
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:09,980
And then I was thinking when the time 
that she to 10 meters,

940
00:42:09,981 --> 00:42:14,981
because I thought she was going to jump 
me it when she come that time and I was 

941
00:42:14,981 --> 00:42:14,981
like,
fuck,

942
00:42:14,981 --> 00:42:16,850
I'm surprised the gun didn't go off 
because I'm sure I had the finger on the

943
00:42:16,851 --> 00:42:21,851
trigger.
Like I just remember thinking white and 

944
00:42:21,851 --> 00:42:24,641
it happened that fast that I reckon that
second time she come at me when she was 

945
00:42:24,641 --> 00:42:25,610
about the 12 or 11 made them.

946
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:30,670
Or even when she just come past the 
original mark that she stopped at 20 

947
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:34,121
meters.
I reckon I pulled the trigger and it 

948
00:42:34,121 --> 00:42:35,801
didn't go off and I kept thinking like 
there's a slide lock on the gun and I 

949
00:42:36,561 --> 00:42:38,660
kept thinking that was jammed up and it 
wasn't at all.

950
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:41,030
Those bullets just didn't fit in that 
gun fit in there.

951
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:46,330
So you never practiced with them at all.
So he entire time you were unarmed yet 

952
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:46,330
tire time.
I was unarmed.

953
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:50,330
I bought,
I bought bear spray from Cabela's.

954
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,940
This man,
it was like the world was fucking out to

955
00:42:52,941 --> 00:42:56,360
get me a bought bear spray from Cabela's
and it's on the audit and the light.

956
00:42:56,361 --> 00:42:59,810
He didn't put in the bag and I got up 
there and unpack the bags on luck.

957
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:01,310
Where's the bear spray?
Fuck.

958
00:43:01,311 --> 00:43:04,480
I don't even know the bear spray might.
So I was able to.

959
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:07,310
When she was all me,
if I even had this chance,

960
00:43:07,311 --> 00:43:12,311
I was ever going to pull an arrow out of
the ball and just try and stab her or 

961
00:43:12,311 --> 00:43:15,230
auto or do you lie dead and cop it or 
what they say with a female grizzly just

962
00:43:15,231 --> 00:43:20,231
try to lay dead because they're just 
trying to eliminate a threat to the 

963
00:43:20,231 --> 00:43:21,280
cubs.
I feel like it'd be really hard to lie.

964
00:43:21,281 --> 00:43:22,940
Did when something scratching your 
heart,

965
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:26,600
I feel like just the instinct to try and
go back at it,

966
00:43:26,601 --> 00:43:28,580
you know,
they're so goddamn powerful.

967
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:30,710
So that happened and then I'm like,
you know what?

968
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:32,360
Like I've got to hike out of there 
anyway,

969
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:34,610
I'm unarmed so I've got to hike out of 
there.

970
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:39,670
I've got to get bullets from somewhere.
A Muslim guy back to the fucking bad 

971
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:39,950
grizzly spot,
you know?

972
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:43,520
Which at least I know there's elk there,
but I've been trying to not do it.

973
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:45,950
You know?
What caliber gun is this point?

974
00:43:45,951 --> 00:43:47,180
40th five.
Okay.

975
00:43:47,181 --> 00:43:48,440
So it's a good gun.
Yeah.

976
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:51,470
But the drama started way before then 
because I'm like,

977
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:56,500
if I'm going to do these hung,
I want to have someone with me like a 

978
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:59,411
hunting buddy.
I'm not going to do that one solo 

979
00:43:59,411 --> 00:43:59,411
anymore because of the grids,
because of the grizzlies.

980
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,910
And so I invited Shane Dorian here,
Buddy Shane.

981
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:07,660
He was common and then the tags in 
Montana got really hard to get so he 

982
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:09,230
couldn't get a tag.
Then I was going to have drama,

983
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,870
film the hunt,
but I found that like couldn't film in a

984
00:44:11,871 --> 00:44:14,870
wilderness area so they couldn't be 
there and I'm just like,

985
00:44:14,871 --> 00:44:19,871
I'm just destined to go there by myself.
And it was like I already knew some shit

986
00:44:20,121 --> 00:44:21,250
was going to go down,
you know?

987
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:23,240
It was like everything kept pushing me 
in that direction.

988
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,010
Now I go back to Montana.
You'll be right.

989
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:26,860
You know you're going to encounter 
grizzly.

990
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:29,390
That's it.
So put this thing in front of your face.

991
00:44:29,391 --> 00:44:30,560
Don't put it by your neck.
There you go.

992
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:31,980
Hello.
Much better.

993
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:38,120
I think I might've been like this when I
started the show and now I've just come 

994
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:38,700
back and you freaking out.
That's what's going on.

995
00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:43,790
I think I'm trying to get told because 
I'm talking about grizzlies and getting 

996
00:44:44,251 --> 00:44:46,290
goosebumps.
Just hearing you talk.

997
00:44:46,291 --> 00:44:47,930
I'm getting her.
Um,

998
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:53,240
I watched the video probably a week ago 
and it was just not ever attack or 

999
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:55,350
anything.
It was just have a big grizzly and I had

1000
00:44:55,351 --> 00:44:58,710
all them feelings rush back to me.
Like it was like I had a full adrenaline

1001
00:44:58,711 --> 00:45:00,040
rush and everything dude,
like the,

1002
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:05,180
my body was for pumping and I,
until the point I was starting to feel 

1003
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:05,490
uncomfortable and like,
fucking what's going on.

1004
00:45:05,491 --> 00:45:06,120
I'm like,
fuck.

1005
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:11,210
I just,
it was just that grizzly video and 

1006
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:11,210
thinking about that grizzly running at 
me,

1007
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:12,540
I could see her as clear as die still 
coming at me.

1008
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:14,850
I remember saying a shoulder's moving 
dude,

1009
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:19,880
as she was just racing.
I can just remember seeing a shoulders 

1010
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:21,180
like pulse site and like in all of her 
hair moving and.

1011
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:28,850
Oh fuck that.
Yeah.

1012
00:45:28,910 --> 00:45:32,300
Did you um,
Rinella just released a podcast?

1013
00:45:32,301 --> 00:45:37,301
Two podcasts in a row?
They got charged by a big male grizzly 

1014
00:45:37,301 --> 00:45:38,360
and Kodiak.
They'd killed an elk.

1015
00:45:38,361 --> 00:45:40,790
Non Kodiak.
A fog neck.

1016
00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:43,200
Yeah.
Which is why saying grammy's videos.

1017
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,150
So yeah,

1018
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:45,590
they um,
they,

1019
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:50,650
they just did a podcast on to podcasts 
in a row and they shot an elk and the 

1020
00:45:52,070 --> 00:45:53,840
fog neck islands,
they have roosevelt elk,

1021
00:45:53,841 --> 00:45:58,841
which is a very large elk and deer.
The biggest roosevelt elk is a huge 

1022
00:45:58,841 --> 00:46:02,051
animal,
like 1400 pound animal and it's crazy 

1023
00:46:02,051 --> 00:46:02,630
thick brush and they're packing this 
thing out.

1024
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:03,410
Took forever.
Right.

1025
00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:06,860
So they shot it when they left some of 
it there,

1026
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:12,100
they went back to go get the,
the elk and Grizzly bear had obviously 

1027
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:15,830
claimed they didn't know they were 
hanging around eating sandwiches.

1028
00:46:15,831 --> 00:46:20,831
They didn't have their guns out.
Nothing in the bear just came running 

1029
00:46:20,831 --> 00:46:20,831
in.
Just charged into all of them.

1030
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:26,050
I'm one of the guys a dartmouth wound up
riding on the back of the bear is a 

1031
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:30,330
fucking crazy story and they're talking 
about it.

1032
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:31,760
Just a giant bear,

1033
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:35,060
10,
11 foot grizzly bear this,

1034
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:36,790
you know,
when people like,

1035
00:46:36,791 --> 00:46:38,410
Oh,
do you believe in big foot or.

1036
00:46:38,411 --> 00:46:40,630
And stuff like that.
We don't fucking have to.

1037
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:44,080
There's a real live monster,
but we just used to say it.

1038
00:46:44,110 --> 00:46:47,290
We call it a grizzly bear.
It fucking can eat.

1039
00:46:47,291 --> 00:46:48,940
You owe it,
eats everything.

1040
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,920
It eats everything.
They just savage

1041
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:55,940
do so big.
I don't think people understand how big 

1042
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:59,021
they are.
I haven't seen a big one in the US in 

1043
00:46:59,021 --> 00:47:03,251
the wild,
but I saw a small one in Alberta in the 

1044
00:47:03,251 --> 00:47:03,251
wild and it scared the shit out of me.

1045
00:47:03,251 --> 00:47:06,270
Oh,
the one that was on my mile carcass last

1046
00:47:06,270 --> 00:47:08,280
year and we spoke about it in last 
year's podcasts.

1047
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:13,520
I remember thinking it's faith is bigger
than my whole torso do and I'm just like

1048
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:16,470
that.
Like that should be mythical,

1049
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,710
but it's fucking not living here right 
now.

1050
00:47:21,050 --> 00:47:23,750
And there's states that are protecting 
them.

1051
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:26,120
Like Holy Shit.
Yeah.

1052
00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:28,650
They want to control the.
They want to help the populations grow.

1053
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:30,160
I think vote would change

1054
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,770
really quickly about protecting them.
Even felt fucking night.

1055
00:47:32,771 --> 00:47:35,160
You dog will one of your kids or trying 
to date you.

1056
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:40,660
I think people,
it would be very hard to get people to 

1057
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:40,660
vote if it killed a dog because people 
go,

1058
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:41,980
well,
you know they were here first.

1059
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:47,410
It's when they start getting into you.
Our friends up in Alberta,

1060
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:52,830
John and Jen Rivet,
they sent me some pictures recently of 

1061
00:47:52,830 --> 00:47:54,670
some bears that had moved into the area 
because they've been pushed out of their

1062
00:47:54,671 --> 00:47:56,230
good area by grizzlies,
right?

1063
00:47:56,310 --> 00:48:01,310
Yeah.
There's a lot of grizzlies grizzlies up 

1064
00:48:01,310 --> 00:48:03,451
there and apparently the talking about 
having some sort of a season on them 

1065
00:48:03,451 --> 00:48:06,070
because people are encountering them on 
a more frequent basis,

1066
00:48:06,071 --> 00:48:11,071
but again,
that area where they live up in Alberta 

1067
00:48:11,071 --> 00:48:13,831
is just so dense and it's so dense that 
trying to figure out how many bears are 

1068
00:48:14,621 --> 00:48:16,000
there,
where the bears are,

1069
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:17,500
so that's a good system.

1070
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:20,830
When I put that time and effort in the 
fine and the numbers like this,

1071
00:48:20,831 --> 00:48:25,831
why the American system is the best 
hunting system I've ever come across 

1072
00:48:25,831 --> 00:48:29,700
because we saw you doing numbers check 
and then you release the tags for what 

1073
00:48:31,061 --> 00:48:34,570
can be taken out of the population to 
keep the population healthy.

1074
00:48:34,571 --> 00:48:39,571
Student.
It's all done by wildlife is a hyper 

1075
00:48:39,571 --> 00:48:40,240
revenue there.
It's an awesome system.

1076
00:48:40,730 --> 00:48:45,730
Well billions of dollars a year from 
hunting revenue in this country that go 

1077
00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:49,030
to wildlife preservation that go to a 
conservation of habitat.

1078
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:54,060
You know,
back country hunters and anglers has a 

1079
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:54,060
great website where all this stuff is 
detailed.

1080
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:56,080
Making Rocky Mountain Health Federation 
does a same similar thing.

1081
00:48:56,410 --> 00:49:01,410
It's just they have decreased the 
detailed numbers on how much money goes 

1082
00:49:01,410 --> 00:49:05,821
into conserving these areas and even 
repopulating these animals into other 

1083
00:49:05,821 --> 00:49:05,821
areas.
Yeah,

1084
00:49:05,821 --> 00:49:07,440
yeah.
It's a brilliant system so it,

1085
00:49:07,470 --> 00:49:07,920
you know,
and.

1086
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:13,100
But it has to be that two sides because 
you can't go fully one while fully the 

1087
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:16,480
Avo because if it goes fully one way and
we've tried frigging wipe amount,

1088
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:21,540
no one wants that.
So there's got to be that middle ground 

1089
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:22,570
there where I think what wayside of the 
greenies fought for as well,

1090
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:23,800
you know,
and then it's like,

1091
00:49:23,801 --> 00:49:28,801
well we know we can afford the shoot 200
of those grizzly bears out of the 10,000

1092
00:49:30,061 --> 00:49:32,230
that live there or whatever it is,
crazy numbers.

1093
00:49:32,830 --> 00:49:37,830
Then that's the system we want.
So it's healthy populations or game 

1094
00:49:37,830 --> 00:49:41,791
every,
every single year for generations to 

1095
00:49:41,791 --> 00:49:44,191
come.
Healthy populations of game and making 

1096
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:44,680
sure that these giant predators don't 
encroach on civilization.

1097
00:49:44,681 --> 00:49:45,490
Yeah,
that's the thing.

1098
00:49:45,491 --> 00:49:48,640
It's like keeping them out.
Once they start wiping out all the moose

1099
00:49:48,641 --> 00:49:53,641
and all the deer and all the elk,
they're gonna move towards people like 

1100
00:49:53,641 --> 00:49:55,060
people need to understand that this is 
not a game.

1101
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,790
You don't encounter them in Santa 
Monica.

1102
00:49:57,791 --> 00:49:58,090
Right?
Yeah.

1103
00:49:58,300 --> 00:49:59,130
So people like,
you know,

1104
00:49:59,131 --> 00:50:01,060
you asshole was just going to kill the 
animals.

1105
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:03,460
That's not,
that's not what these people are doing.

1106
00:50:03,490 --> 00:50:04,810
You don't understand you.
Not Exactly.

1107
00:50:04,811 --> 00:50:09,811
Yeah.
Like you could tell them maybe if they 

1108
00:50:09,811 --> 00:50:12,930
maybe they've heard you like be around 
them and understand what the fuck this 

1109
00:50:12,930 --> 00:50:15,220
is.
Giant 1500 pound monster.

1110
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:20,520
That doesn't think like,
Oh that dude that I'm going to eight 

1111
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:20,520
might have kids.

1112
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:27,200
They just thinking food hall in me 
stomach and don't want to fill up.

1113
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:28,190
The greenies would say,

1114
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:30,820
well that elk,
you killed those kids to math.

1115
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:36,030
Why these greenies out?
They're petitioning against fucking 

1116
00:50:36,030 --> 00:50:37,790
lions killing shit.
Why aren't they?

1117
00:50:37,791 --> 00:50:38,130
Yeah.
Right.

1118
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,400
Why aren't low like lines are killing 
shit.

1119
00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:42,830
We were just talking about just part of 
the food chain as well.

1120
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:44,510
Do we are part of this whole system.

1121
00:50:44,570 --> 00:50:47,360
Courtney do alter on the podcast.
I was talking to her about,

1122
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:49,400
you know,
people occasionally when they're running

1123
00:50:49,401 --> 00:50:50,720
these trails.
We running the mountain lions.

1124
00:50:50,721 --> 00:50:53,270
We were talking about this lady who 
lives in Malibu,

1125
00:50:53,271 --> 00:50:55,370
has an Alpaca farm,
a mountain lion,

1126
00:50:55,371 --> 00:51:00,371
got Intel,
Pacos killed 11 of them and a goat just 

1127
00:51:00,371 --> 00:51:01,170
wiped them out.
Just fucking decimated the PO.

1128
00:51:01,730 --> 00:51:06,730
That was fruit killing.
And so this lady got a depredation 

1129
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,270
permit to kill them out and she got all 
these death threats from people.

1130
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:09,260
Yeah.
Right.

1131
00:51:09,410 --> 00:51:12,110
But it's always like,
do you understand that this now mine,

1132
00:51:12,130 --> 00:51:13,430
it's killing animals too.

1133
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:13,990
Two.
Yeah,

1134
00:51:13,991 --> 00:51:14,410
yeah,
yeah.

1135
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:18,040
Way more animals.
I can understand it.

1136
00:51:18,110 --> 00:51:19,130
Well,
it's not logical.

1137
00:51:19,131 --> 00:51:23,300
It's just emotional and I think a big 
part of the problem with two,

1138
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:25,100
there's two,
two parts of the problem.

1139
00:51:25,101 --> 00:51:28,610
One,
lack of real wilderness exposure,

1140
00:51:28,970 --> 00:51:33,970
like real time in the woods,
understanding what this whole ecosystem 

1141
00:51:33,970 --> 00:51:36,020
is really all about because it's just a 
Predator prey ecosystem.

1142
00:51:36,410 --> 00:51:41,410
And when a hunter goes into that,
you really just dipping your toes into 

1143
00:51:41,410 --> 00:51:41,510
the wild world a little bit.
Yeah,

1144
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:43,880
exactly.
Then the other part of it is movies,

1145
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:47,600
all these fucking bear movies where the 
bears are your friends,

1146
00:51:47,601 --> 00:51:52,601
they talk to each other and all these 
anthropomorphized anthropomorphization 

1147
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:55,690
movies,
whether it's Bambi or whether it.

1148
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:00,470
Whereas if you go out into the woods and
see yourself,

1149
00:52:00,530 --> 00:52:05,530
you know,
it's a much better understanding and a 

1150
00:52:05,530 --> 00:52:07,691
much better experience for the more 
people get exposed to these movies with 

1151
00:52:07,691 --> 00:52:12,110
bears talk and they're your buddy.
Then get exposed to an actual charge.

1152
00:52:12,550 --> 00:52:14,490
Fucking Mama grizzly bear like you did.
Yeah.

1153
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:15,400
Yeah.
It's crazy.

1154
00:52:15,450 --> 00:52:18,180
He wants to kill those payments.
A wipe.

1155
00:52:18,330 --> 00:52:20,310
I didn't look at that mother grizzly and
be like,

1156
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:22,160
I want to shoot you.
If you look at the video,

1157
00:52:22,161 --> 00:52:27,161
you'll actually hear me gone.
I really don't want to shoot this bear 

1158
00:52:27,161 --> 00:52:27,500
like she's just doing what her instinct 
tells her.

1159
00:52:27,550 --> 00:52:29,000
Yeah.
I'm not even cranky Adot,

1160
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:33,830
but I don't want to fucking die,
so it's a terrible way to die too.

1161
00:52:33,890 --> 00:52:36,560
That'd be a horrible way to die.
A jaw.

1162
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:41,180
The size of this table closing down on 
you wouldn't be good.

1163
00:52:43,010 --> 00:52:43,300
Yeah.

1164
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:48,400
Well,
they're going to open up a season 

1165
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:48,950
apparently on them near near yellowstone
to many situations.

1166
00:52:49,170 --> 00:52:50,600
Yup.
Bears.

1167
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:55,720
Yeah.
That's roughly the area that on the air 

1168
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:55,910
and that's where they released a lot of 
the problem bears too.

1169
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:57,260
That's what I do.
Yeah.

1170
00:52:57,970 --> 00:53:00,510
So I went to an area that they didn't 
release problem.

1171
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:05,520
There's no.
Because I'd never say a female grizzly 

1172
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:08,501
where I usually hunt in Montana.
They were old miles or loan animals at 

1173
00:53:08,501 --> 00:53:08,501
least.
And I can't tell.

1174
00:53:08,501 --> 00:53:10,210
And the males are less likely to charge.
Well,

1175
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:11,750
it seems like it.
Yeah,

1176
00:53:11,751 --> 00:53:16,751
it seems like the males.
Well if a male charged you is to eat 

1177
00:53:16,751 --> 00:53:16,751
you?
Yeah.

1178
00:53:16,751 --> 00:53:21,110
Because you know,
yelled at that one on my car last year 

1179
00:53:21,110 --> 00:53:21,110
and he wanted to go to the apple.
Why he,

1180
00:53:21,110 --> 00:53:25,490
he ran off and frequent disappeared.
And it's interesting because Montana 

1181
00:53:25,490 --> 00:53:28,781
does not have a bear season,
so these are not animals like Alaska 

1182
00:53:28,781 --> 00:53:29,310
bears.
Avoid people like the play.

1183
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:30,110
Exactly.
Yep.

1184
00:53:30,170 --> 00:53:31,980
Yep.
Because they're afraid of being shot.

1185
00:53:32,070 --> 00:53:33,360
Yeah.
So he like ran off.

1186
00:53:33,361 --> 00:53:37,560
I think I only yelled at oil to him that
one last year and he disappeared.

1187
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:42,860
This female grizzly that was running it.
I mean I was calling her a fucking mall 

1188
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:44,460
and everything might shake a mall.
What's the mall?

1189
00:53:44,490 --> 00:53:46,080
I knew that was an Australian word.

1190
00:53:49,210 --> 00:53:54,210
So me and my buddy Andrew Boucles,
who I've just spent last week with him 

1191
00:53:54,210 --> 00:53:57,040
in Arnhem land in northern territory.
He come,

1192
00:53:57,540 --> 00:54:02,540
you'd just be sitting in the vehicle 
driving along and it's all quiet and 

1193
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:02,640
peaceful and then he would just come up 
with something weird like,

1194
00:54:02,930 --> 00:54:03,600
you know,
if,

1195
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:08,760
if you had to bring any active back from
the dead to hunt with you for a week,

1196
00:54:08,761 --> 00:54:12,900
who would have been fuck honeys and 
trying to think about that.

1197
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:15,660
But um,
then I can't have one because I'm like,

1198
00:54:15,661 --> 00:54:20,661
he's coming up with all this shit.
I'm going to call it one of them over 

1199
00:54:20,661 --> 00:54:23,481
this trip.
We just need to come up with real 

1200
00:54:23,481 --> 00:54:26,211
Australian things,
sayings that aren't getting used 

1201
00:54:26,211 --> 00:54:26,211
anymore.
And mine was like,

1202
00:54:26,211 --> 00:54:26,600
Tyler,
like,

1203
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:31,900
do you have that one?
Like if you say bye or someone instead 

1204
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:32,670
of saying by just say Tyler,
I'm fucking get blank stares.

1205
00:54:33,210 --> 00:54:35,520
Like a magician would say 10.
Ah,

1206
00:54:35,650 --> 00:54:37,200
it's like tyler,
like as in.

1207
00:54:37,210 --> 00:54:38,200
See you later.
No,

1208
00:54:38,230 --> 00:54:39,780
Tata for now.
What about her?

1209
00:54:39,790 --> 00:54:43,050
I know.
All right,

1210
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:43,940
bye.
No.

1211
00:54:44,050 --> 00:54:45,840
Oh fuck her.
Raise like victory.

1212
00:54:45,910 --> 00:54:50,910
Okay.
Well Mall is like I'm calling someone a 

1213
00:54:52,081 --> 00:54:54,530
bitch or a skank.
A mall.

1214
00:54:54,570 --> 00:54:55,860
You've got skank?
Yes.

1215
00:54:55,950 --> 00:54:57,150
Yeah.
Yeah.

1216
00:54:57,180 --> 00:55:02,180
So she's running at me.
I'm like fucking ease up your fucking 

1217
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:02,180
mall,
you know.

1218
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:02,690
And she's like,
fuck,

1219
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:04,750
is this guy from?
It's probably why she didn't eat.

1220
00:55:04,990 --> 00:55:06,870
She was from here.
She didn't even say this,

1221
00:55:06,871 --> 00:55:08,820
but I imagine she was thinking,
I don't speak English.

1222
00:55:09,970 --> 00:55:14,150
He doesn't even know what a dummy reach 
it.

1223
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:16,930
No,
I've never heard of a mold before.

1224
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:19,670
A mall,
like a mall of America.

1225
00:55:19,671 --> 00:55:22,850
M O l e like molly.
I get.

1226
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:27,950
Yeah,
but I think it's more of like mall in 

1227
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:27,950
your face.
I,

1228
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:28,680
he's,
he's brought all ll slang.

1229
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:31,710
Slang,
term two different Australia,

1230
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:32,760
Australia,
New Zealand.

1231
00:55:32,790 --> 00:55:33,960
Oh,
in the United States.

1232
00:55:34,290 --> 00:55:39,290
Usually a pejorative or self deprecating
for a woman of loose sexual morals.

1233
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:40,170
Shit,
bitch.

1234
00:55:40,171 --> 00:55:43,080
I said big slot or a prostitute.
Damn,

1235
00:55:43,081 --> 00:55:44,830
no wonder she was pissed off.
Wow.

1236
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:50,510
Mall Mall.
That's probably like some old shit from 

1237
00:55:50,510 --> 00:55:52,140
America that we like.
We gave to you long time ago.

1238
00:55:52,230 --> 00:55:57,230
We abandoned it.
Then you guys picked it up probably 

1239
00:55:57,230 --> 00:56:01,510
probably so when you went and got boats,
she went and got bullets for the Fed and

1240
00:56:01,511 --> 00:56:06,511
I went and bought bullets.
Jump Straight back into Montana but me 

1241
00:56:06,511 --> 00:56:07,770
old spot in Montana.
And then um,

1242
00:56:08,170 --> 00:56:11,590
I only had three days at that point to 
try and cause,

1243
00:56:11,591 --> 00:56:16,591
you know,
it was after a bull elk and I'd passed 

1244
00:56:16,591 --> 00:56:17,280
up a lot of younger animals and like 
immature animals over that time.

1245
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:22,880
But um,
I went from the hot heat to got to my 

1246
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:25,140
usual spot in Montana.
And why out that was.

1247
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:25,420
No.

1248
00:56:25,850 --> 00:56:28,660
Explain that for people that aren't 
hunters is.

1249
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:33,680
It is very important.
If you want to consider the overall 

1250
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:36,071
health of the herd,
you always want to shoot the older 

1251
00:56:36,071 --> 00:56:36,071
mature animals because those are the 
ones that are bred.

1252
00:56:36,390 --> 00:56:41,390
They've passed on their genetics and it 
also improves the health of the herd 

1253
00:56:41,390 --> 00:56:43,100
because then the younger males.
That's right.

1254
00:56:43,110 --> 00:56:48,110
I would probably get killed by the 
bigger males or have the potential 

1255
00:56:48,110 --> 00:56:48,800
getting killed in combat when they 
clashed.

1256
00:56:48,950 --> 00:56:53,950
And that's the whole reason.
If people don't know why they have 

1257
00:56:53,950 --> 00:56:53,950
antlers

1258
00:56:53,950 --> 00:56:53,950
finding it.
Yeah,

1259
00:56:53,950 --> 00:56:53,950
exactly.
Yep.

1260
00:56:53,950 --> 00:56:58,290
I think my,
my biggest thought in that is I just 

1261
00:56:58,290 --> 00:56:59,140
want to shoot an animal that's lived its
life.

1262
00:57:00,330 --> 00:57:00,880
Like,
look,

1263
00:57:00,881 --> 00:57:02,620
if I'm desperate for me,
don't get me wrong,

1264
00:57:02,621 --> 00:57:07,621
I'll shoot a spike or a cow or whatever,
but I'm not desperate for meat.

1265
00:57:07,781 --> 00:57:09,730
And that point of survival,
you know,

1266
00:57:09,731 --> 00:57:14,731
so I just feel a lot better if I shoot 
an animal that unlike it's lived its 

1267
00:57:14,731 --> 00:57:14,731
life,
you know.

1268
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:18,370
And then the byproduct of that is you 
get a bigger animal,

1269
00:57:18,430 --> 00:57:20,020
so more meat,
you know,

1270
00:57:20,021 --> 00:57:23,020
you get a set of antlers,
which is to me a memory.

1271
00:57:23,021 --> 00:57:28,021
It's not like about,
I don't cut the head off and just walk 

1272
00:57:28,021 --> 00:57:28,021
out at the end.
I was like,

1273
00:57:28,021 --> 00:57:31,440
I've got a trophy.
And I think a lot of people think that 

1274
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:31,730
for me it's a yf respect,
but it's just,

1275
00:57:31,770 --> 00:57:33,700
it's a way of respecting the animal to 
me,

1276
00:57:34,270 --> 00:57:35,900
you know,
so it's,

1277
00:57:35,901 --> 00:57:36,670
it's a funny thing.

1278
00:57:36,670 --> 00:57:38,140
But yeah,
just shooting a big old,

1279
00:57:38,350 --> 00:57:43,350
you know,
and that's why I passed a lot of lot of 

1280
00:57:43,350 --> 00:57:45,540
young animals.
I had opportunities that was one dials 

1281
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:45,540
rod on the edge of this,
like,

1282
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:50,160
like it's like a cliff.
But there was a rock that went out over 

1283
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,861
the cliff,
like a bit of a pinnacle and I was 

1284
00:57:52,861 --> 00:57:53,830
actually on the pinnacle and I had this 
bowl strike below me and he was like,

1285
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:59,160
I think he was,
he was 30 something made his butt 

1286
00:57:59,160 --> 00:57:59,160
because you're shooting down.
It's like,

1287
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:01,180
you know,
the range finders science you to that 16

1288
00:58:01,181 --> 00:58:04,060
or 17 meters.
And he was just lying there,

1289
00:58:04,061 --> 00:58:06,400
had no idea it was there.
Um,

1290
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:11,820
but just a younger bull,
you can see it in his face and his body 

1291
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:11,820
and just these analysts.
So.

1292
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:13,840
But it felt good to be there and then be
like,

1293
00:58:13,841 --> 00:58:14,950
Nah.
And back out.

1294
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:17,950
And then it was afternoon.
I think that that Greasley went me,

1295
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:20,590
so you know,
I had opportunities to shoot balls,

1296
00:58:20,591 --> 00:58:24,400
but I pretty much went 21 days without 
an opportunity where I'm like,

1297
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:26,590
this is the bullet I'm going to shoot,
you know,

1298
00:58:26,591 --> 00:58:28,580
and I'm getting into the zone,
have this.

1299
00:58:28,610 --> 00:58:30,460
The thing that people I think

1300
00:58:30,810 --> 00:58:35,810
on the outside don't understand or 
appreciate is that it's not just about 

1301
00:58:36,391 --> 00:58:41,391
getting me,
it's also about getting a mature animal 

1302
00:58:41,391 --> 00:58:45,591
and it's also about getting a mature 
animal because they're way more 

1303
00:58:45,591 --> 00:58:45,591
different.

1304
00:58:45,591 --> 00:58:45,591
Exactly,
yeah.

1305
00:58:45,591 --> 00:58:46,900
They are way smarter and Bain for 
seasons,

1306
00:58:46,901 --> 00:58:48,720
you know,
they just heaps more switched on.

1307
00:58:48,721 --> 00:58:50,190
You know,
there are a lot smarter.

1308
00:58:50,191 --> 00:58:52,590
So you wanna let's like going into a 
fight.

1309
00:58:52,591 --> 00:58:57,591
Like you don't want to go into a fight 
with someone that's never done 

1310
00:58:57,591 --> 00:58:59,010
kickboxing and yoga champion kickboxer.
So like that's ridiculous.

1311
00:58:59,011 --> 00:59:04,011
Like where's the challenge in that?
How are you going to be better at doing 

1312
00:59:04,011 --> 00:59:07,641
what you're doing?
If you're just fighting the fight that 

1313
00:59:07,641 --> 00:59:10,611
you know you're always going to win.
And then I say it very early in that 

1314
00:59:10,611 --> 00:59:12,030
trip.
I'm happy to go home without a ball,

1315
00:59:12,450 --> 00:59:17,450
but I'm not happy to give up on day 
three or four or sit around camp and 

1316
00:59:17,450 --> 00:59:20,070
then go home available.
I want to bust my ass,

1317
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:25,160
you know,
I want to get to point where I say to 

1318
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:27,341
myself,
and I did it multiple times on this 

1319
00:59:27,341 --> 00:59:27,341
trip,
what the fuck are you doing?

1320
00:59:27,341 --> 00:59:27,860
Like give up.
This is too hard,

1321
00:59:27,861 --> 00:59:30,640
you know,
I want to get to that point where myself

1322
00:59:30,670 --> 00:59:33,050
write down because I feel like that's 
the most you ever grow,

1323
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:36,020
you know,
in any sort of hardship.

1324
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:41,080
But you know,
it's like freaking campaigns running 

1325
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:41,080
this.
Like,

1326
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:44,890
you know,
he's guest going to find a longer 

1327
00:59:44,890 --> 00:59:44,890
marathon next time.
Well that's what courtney was saying,

1328
00:59:44,890 --> 00:59:49,811
that they're considering a 500 holly 
block run 500.

1329
00:59:51,850 --> 00:59:54,020
I can't even fathom that dude.
Yeah,

1330
00:59:54,021 --> 00:59:55,540
I mean how many days would that take?
I don't know.

1331
00:59:55,580 --> 00:59:59,660
I can't even fathom going counting days.
It's probably like a week.

1332
00:59:59,740 --> 01:00:01,160
It's probably going to be a week of 
running.

1333
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:02,210
Yeah.
So it's just,

1334
01:00:02,211 --> 01:00:03,560
you always up in it,
you know,

1335
01:00:03,561 --> 01:00:06,020
like I'll go to,
I got to pull back a little bit now.

1336
01:00:06,021 --> 01:00:09,550
Like I don't like that's about the 
maximum that all do.

1337
01:00:10,850 --> 01:00:12,390
Twenty to 22.
Yeah.

1338
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:17,860
And then.
But it was a lot longer without the 

1339
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:19,520
family because you know,
the flights here and the flights back.

1340
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:22,760
And I went,
I was with Yeti and I went,

1341
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:27,940
well I did the whole Yeti thing and went
to the innovation center and hung out 

1342
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:29,060
with Yeti for like a couple of days.
Me and Bendigo.

1343
01:00:29,070 --> 01:00:32,320
Brian went down to west Texas hundred 
some axis D,

1344
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:34,340
um,
I went bass fishing.

1345
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:38,060
So there was like,
there was like a week and a half on that

1346
01:00:38,061 --> 01:00:43,061
trip that probably a lot of people 
didn't realize that I'm without my kids 

1347
01:00:43,061 --> 01:00:43,061
and family,
you know,

1348
01:00:43,061 --> 01:00:47,380
that's the hard bit.
I could go and live out there like a 

1349
01:00:47,380 --> 01:00:49,660
frigging hermit.
But I've got family and I freaking love 

1350
01:00:49,660 --> 01:00:49,660
them and miss him.
Dude.

1351
01:00:49,660 --> 01:00:50,890
You know what I mean?
I'm saying the and like,

1352
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:54,590
you fuck this for me because I'm sitting
on the mountain like,

1353
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:56,210
you know,
this is all me,

1354
01:00:56,211 --> 01:00:58,820
my element up there,
like it's out in the middle of nowhere.

1355
01:00:58,820 --> 01:01:00,980
There's no people,
there's no lights,

1356
01:01:00,981 --> 01:01:02,780
you know,
there's just wild animals running around

1357
01:01:02,990 --> 01:01:04,700
and I'm sitting on the mountain.
I'm like,

1358
01:01:04,701 --> 01:01:05,810
fuck,
I'm Ms Dot Kim.

1359
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:10,100
But don't you think that that's one of 
the reasons why you appreciate them even

1360
01:01:10,101 --> 01:01:12,950
more than your family?
So much as it is.

1361
01:01:12,951 --> 01:01:13,880
But yeah,
I,

1362
01:01:13,881 --> 01:01:15,860
you know,
I said once to Steve Rinella.

1363
01:01:15,861 --> 01:01:19,420
We did this crazy hunt and Prince of 
Wales and it rained every day and it was

1364
01:01:19,421 --> 01:01:24,421
just,
we were just drenched where you're 

1365
01:01:24,421 --> 01:01:26,261
inside your tent and the tent,
like I turned on my headlamp and there 

1366
01:01:26,261 --> 01:01:26,930
was just water vapor everywhere in the 
tent,

1367
01:01:26,931 --> 01:01:29,840
like nothing ever dried out,
sleeping bags wet,

1368
01:01:29,841 --> 01:01:33,620
you're miserable.
But when I got home,

1369
01:01:33,950 --> 01:01:35,720
I called him up and I said,
man,

1370
01:01:35,721 --> 01:01:40,721
I have never felt good.
I'm so happy the sun is out and I'm 

1371
01:01:40,721 --> 01:01:45,251
driving and I just feel amazing.
I feel like I'm on a drug and I called 

1372
01:01:45,251 --> 01:01:45,251
him up and I go,
dude,

1373
01:01:45,251 --> 01:01:46,460
I have never been happier.

1374
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:48,500
Crazy.
I miserable.

1375
01:01:48,501 --> 01:01:49,480
It is.
Yeah.

1376
01:01:49,970 --> 01:01:50,810
The better,
you know,

1377
01:01:50,830 --> 01:01:55,830
and they have to experience some 
difficulty in some hardship in order to 

1378
01:01:55,830 --> 01:01:56,260
appreciate the good times.
Yeah,

1379
01:01:56,330 --> 01:01:57,020
yeah,
exactly.

1380
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:59,270
I've,
I feel like frequent with Kim.

1381
01:01:59,271 --> 01:02:04,271
It's like we're new newlywed till the 
time and it's probably because I'm away 

1382
01:02:04,271 --> 01:02:04,460
so much,
but every time I come home,

1383
01:02:04,461 --> 01:02:05,720
you know,
overcome a while.

1384
01:02:05,721 --> 01:02:07,370
I'm thinking about him flat out,
you know,

1385
01:02:07,371 --> 01:02:10,280
I actually just renewed my vows with Kim
15,

1386
01:02:10,550 --> 01:02:12,650
15 years,
15 years,

1387
01:02:12,651 --> 01:02:14,120
married,
18 years together.

1388
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:19,240
Yeah.
I think that there's something to that 

1389
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:19,240
man.
I mean,

1390
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:19,240
people,
you know,

1391
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:20,490
absence makes the heart grow fonder.
It's a common expression.

1392
01:02:20,491 --> 01:02:23,450
I think it's totally true and I think 
that I,

1393
01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:25,830
I don't think life is supposed to be 
easy.

1394
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:31,080
I just did not.
I think you're supposed to do some 

1395
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:31,080
difficult cit,
but on,

1396
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:34,880
I think the sooner you realize that then
it does seem easy to you.

1397
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:40,280
Does that make sense?
It's like the sooner you realize that 

1398
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:40,800
life's supposed to be fucking tough and 
if it's not,

1399
01:02:40,801 --> 01:02:44,880
put yourself through some tough shit,
then the better dude then it just,

1400
01:02:45,350 --> 01:02:50,350
it it.
Right now I feel like I've found the 

1401
01:02:50,350 --> 01:02:50,840
recipe just to be happy as hell.
I've been silent.

1402
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:53,700
The last frequent mom fly.
I don't want this to happen,

1403
01:02:53,701 --> 01:02:56,940
but I've been signed to Kim and she sort
of gets teed up fucking just no,

1404
01:02:56,941 --> 01:02:59,420
I'm happy to die right now.
Logging.

1405
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:01,770
I really may not.
I'm happy to fucking die right now.

1406
01:03:01,771 --> 01:03:06,771
I want to see my kids grow and I want to
say my kids have kids and I want to 

1407
01:03:06,771 --> 01:03:09,741
spend the attorney with eternity with 
that woman but on fucking happy to die 

1408
01:03:09,741 --> 01:03:11,780
right now and that happy.
And why do you see?

1409
01:03:11,910 --> 01:03:16,910
Why do you think like that?
Because I feel like I've just lived 

1410
01:03:16,910 --> 01:03:17,420
through our law for already and I'll put
you still enjoy it.

1411
01:03:17,420 --> 01:03:22,420
Every good.
I still enjoy and be happy to die 

1412
01:03:22,420 --> 01:03:24,120
because I'm fucking crazy.
Probably.

1413
01:03:24,270 --> 01:03:27,960
I ain't doin anything out of the 
ordinary to fucking die.

1414
01:03:27,961 --> 01:03:32,961
But you talk a little bit,
but that's fucked up.

1415
01:03:33,670 --> 01:03:38,670
That shit the fuck out.
That's probably not good.

1416
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:43,840
But Jesus Christ.
Did you get back until that dude who 

1417
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:43,840
gave you the 45?
Hey,

1418
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:43,840
fuck face.
Yeah.

1419
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:43,890
Yeah.
He was freaking.

1420
01:03:43,940 --> 01:03:47,810
They're the nicest people.
It was kay and Ed that were in Oregon.

1421
01:03:47,830 --> 01:03:49,200
Yeah.
They're the nicest people.

1422
01:03:49,201 --> 01:03:51,170
And I think aid was freaking more than 
me.

1423
01:03:51,610 --> 01:03:52,650
I'm like,
it's all good.

1424
01:03:52,651 --> 01:03:54,090
But uh,
yeah.

1425
01:03:54,091 --> 01:03:59,091
Fuck you to know that you had the good,
you had it out and there was nothing 

1426
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:00,960
they wouldn't.
Yeah.

1427
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:06,170
Woo.
And then so I had to sleep there that 

1428
01:04:06,170 --> 01:04:06,170
night because I wasn't walking out in 
the dark.

1429
01:04:06,170 --> 01:04:07,890
And the worst thing is I'm sleeping on 
the,

1430
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:10,920
at the elevation that she's at and 
cheese.

1431
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:14,100
I only about 400 meters in a direct line
from my camp.

1432
01:04:14,370 --> 01:04:16,220
Oh Jesus Christ is.
So.

1433
01:04:16,350 --> 01:04:19,580
Did you sleep well?
So I manually put a shell in the chamber

1434
01:04:19,581 --> 01:04:22,930
side one shell and I just fucking.
I actually slept really good that not,

1435
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:26,310
I don't know if it was adrenaline wore 
were and often it wore me out more.

1436
01:04:26,370 --> 01:04:31,370
Were you convinced that it was going to 
fire even with that one shell in the 

1437
01:04:31,370 --> 01:04:32,400
chamber?
I would have because I couldn't have the

1438
01:04:32,401 --> 01:04:35,220
magazine in there because it would jam 
on the bullet,

1439
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:39,420
but I could drop a shell in there 
manually and that'd be good to go.

1440
01:04:39,630 --> 01:04:40,840
I had one bullet.
Yeah.

1441
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:46,230
Russian roulette with no fucking good.
I can add me.

1442
01:04:46,231 --> 01:04:47,610
No,
I found that night as well.

1443
01:04:47,611 --> 01:04:52,611
Like sleeping with me.
Does your knife not fuck God,

1444
01:04:54,930 --> 01:04:59,930
she's probably thinking it's a mosquito.
Notice a fucking thick.

1445
01:05:00,390 --> 01:05:03,180
Their skin is so thick because they bite
each other.

1446
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:04,320
Yeah.
Go Watch that.

1447
01:05:04,321 --> 01:05:09,321
A grizzly man documentary,
one of the craziest things was watching 

1448
01:05:09,321 --> 01:05:10,340
the two grizzlies fight.
They were just tearing each other apart,

1449
01:05:10,370 --> 01:05:12,990
bite each other's heads,
and when it was over he didn't look like

1450
01:05:12,991 --> 01:05:16,760
anything.
Tore us to shreds body.

1451
01:05:16,770 --> 01:05:20,510
That's had really good experience in 
northwest territories.

1452
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:25,800
You know,
there's black and grizzlies living in 

1453
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:28,411
the same area.
He's experienced the two fighting and 

1454
01:05:28,411 --> 01:05:28,710
has never liked the black bag bear 
grizzly.

1455
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:30,560
It's always the grizzly running down the
black bay.

1456
01:05:30,820 --> 01:05:33,710
He said one swat from a grizzly bear,
you know,

1457
01:05:33,770 --> 01:05:38,260
a bigger blackberries once from a 
grizzly bear and the black bear might be

1458
01:05:38,261 --> 01:05:40,100
dead,
but it's fucking disabled mate.

1459
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:45,840
One Swipe.
So imagine what one swipe from agrees 

1460
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:45,840
grizzly would do to us.
You

1461
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:49,730
know,
there's a picture of campaigns and a 

1462
01:05:49,730 --> 01:05:52,440
grizzly that he shot in Alaska and he's 
holding up.

1463
01:05:52,441 --> 01:05:57,441
It's Paul.
It's the to bear that he shot was like 

1464
01:05:57,441 --> 01:06:02,301
11 feet tall and he's holding up.
It's Paul and the PA is like a fucking 

1465
01:06:02,301 --> 01:06:03,130
dinner plates.
Gary.

1466
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:06,420
It's like this big,
maybe bigger than it didn't imagine that

1467
01:06:06,421 --> 01:06:10,500
bitch slap followed by clothes.
Dude is dry doctorate yet.

1468
01:06:10,590 --> 01:06:13,680
Look at the size of that thing.
Fuck the pole.

1469
01:06:13,681 --> 01:06:16,460
A look at the tape on that blog.
Blogs.

1470
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:17,720
Yeah.
Oh No,

1471
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:21,390
not again.
Damn.

1472
01:06:21,391 --> 01:06:22,960
Your cams.
White teeth.

1473
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:25,760
Want them?
You could just get that charcoal.

1474
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:30,690
Do you drink coffee?
Yeah,

1475
01:06:30,691 --> 01:06:32,520
I do.
I wonder if too though.

1476
01:06:32,850 --> 01:06:33,840
He drinks coffee.
Yeah.

1477
01:06:33,841 --> 01:06:38,841
But coffee month had bleach in it and 
are fucking enormous.

1478
01:06:41,101 --> 01:06:42,750
Enormous roles.
But like you said,

1479
01:06:42,751 --> 01:06:45,730
I mean that really is a real live living
monster.

1480
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:47,970
Crazy.
I love that.

1481
01:06:47,971 --> 01:06:48,330
Dude.
They,

1482
01:06:48,331 --> 01:06:51,120
I'm just having a joke.
He's a fucking legend.

1483
01:06:51,150 --> 01:06:52,180
He's the best.
Yeah.

1484
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:54,120
But um,
I mean,

1485
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:59,400
he know John Dudley saw a grizzly bear 
take out a moose with one swipe.

1486
01:06:59,850 --> 01:07:04,530
He saw it through a spotting scope.
He saw a grizzly bear hit a moose in the

1487
01:07:04,531 --> 01:07:06,930
back and break it.
Spriker and spawn date.

1488
01:07:07,070 --> 01:07:12,070
Just they hit sign.
They'll probably one of the few animals 

1489
01:07:12,070 --> 01:07:12,520
that like hits.
Yes.

1490
01:07:12,521 --> 01:07:15,120
I wonder what chance have we got?
You might zero.

1491
01:07:15,121 --> 01:07:17,260
You're a bit mad.
Fuck.

1492
01:07:17,261 --> 01:07:17,820
Come on,
man.

1493
01:07:19,020 --> 01:07:21,550
Breaks the back of.
This is Kate my scollon.

1494
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:23,190
Yeah.
They're just so big.

1495
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:25,710
They're so goddamned big frigging 
living.

1496
01:07:25,770 --> 01:07:27,790
Bigfoot dude right there.
Yeah.

1497
01:07:28,890 --> 01:07:30,960
Big.
It's only like eight foot tall monkey.

1498
01:07:30,990 --> 01:07:32,710
They probably fucking what?
Big Foot.

1499
01:07:33,330 --> 01:07:35,490
They probably fucked bigfoot Tamala 
death.

1500
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:39,550
This fucking where we'll fucking this 
gorilla.

1501
01:07:41,620 --> 01:07:42,930
Well,
what's crazy is that.

1502
01:07:42,931 --> 01:07:45,750
That's a small bear.
Compare it to the short face.

1503
01:07:45,751 --> 01:07:47,840
Bear was short nose bear.
What was it?

1504
01:07:48,110 --> 01:07:52,200
What was that bear that lived in the.
I seen the face bear.

1505
01:07:52,201 --> 01:07:55,230
They think they call it,
which is bigger even than a polar bear.

1506
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:59,010
Kodiak bear.
There's a picture of these guys standing

1507
01:07:59,250 --> 01:08:01,670
next to a um,
yeah,

1508
01:08:01,671 --> 01:08:04,020
that's it.
That's the Holy Shit.

1509
01:08:04,021 --> 01:08:09,021
That's scary.
And that thing had long legs and that 

1510
01:08:09,021 --> 01:08:13,010
thing apparently was so fast and so 
ferocious that it kept people from 

1511
01:08:13,010 --> 01:08:14,800
crossing the bering land bridge.
Uh,

1512
01:08:14,980 --> 01:08:18,260
that's one of the reasons why they think
that people,

1513
01:08:18,350 --> 01:08:21,200
it took so long for human beings to make
it to North America.

1514
01:08:21,230 --> 01:08:26,060
It's Paul as big as that dude chess.
They're the bigger dude that is.

1515
01:08:26,090 --> 01:08:27,740
Look how much bigger there than anything
else.

1516
01:08:28,310 --> 01:08:33,310
There's a grizzly polar,
and then the powers of big data 

1517
01:08:33,310 --> 01:08:34,760
analytics,
thinkful I think 10,000

1518
01:08:34,930 --> 01:08:35,190
years.

1519
01:08:35,980 --> 01:08:37,940
I think that was the final.
If that's the case,

1520
01:08:37,941 --> 01:08:39,460
Jamie,
find out why.

1521
01:08:39,530 --> 01:08:44,530
But there's a picture of a seven facts 
about the extinct giant bear hug.

1522
01:08:46,670 --> 01:08:49,550
Eleven thousand years.
Go back to that last page.

1523
01:08:49,551 --> 01:08:51,980
You are pleased and look at that one 
image.

1524
01:08:52,550 --> 01:08:54,890
It's really a guy up in the right hand 
corner.

1525
01:08:54,940 --> 01:08:57,030
The guy touching the face.
Oh yeah,

1526
01:08:59,030 --> 01:09:04,030
that's what God damn it.
I mean,

1527
01:09:04,341 --> 01:09:09,341
that is a monster.
That's a monster from Avatar or from 

1528
01:09:09,341 --> 01:09:13,091
star wars and that's a real animal that 
lived alongside people for a long ass 

1529
01:09:13,491 --> 01:09:14,720
time,
but see what I mean.

1530
01:09:14,730 --> 01:09:16,760
If they would just run her in the wallet
still,

1531
01:09:17,150 --> 01:09:22,150
we just have a normal name for them and 
it wouldn't be any different cause 

1532
01:09:22,150 --> 01:09:22,150
exactly.
Seen Him,

1533
01:09:22,150 --> 01:09:22,340
dude.
It's like the galaxy,

1534
01:09:22,341 --> 01:09:24,530
like you're used to looking at it,
say the Milky Way.

1535
01:09:24,531 --> 01:09:25,730
So it's like,
oh cool,

1536
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:26,900
fuck off.

1537
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:28,310
Had that.
Think about that.

1538
01:09:28,340 --> 01:09:30,680
Yeah,
that is freaky dude.

1539
01:09:30,770 --> 01:09:35,770
Oh yeah.
I've always said that if space wasn't 

1540
01:09:35,770 --> 01:09:35,770
real,
like if there was a roof over the world,

1541
01:09:35,770 --> 01:09:36,620
but there was one place where you could 
go,

1542
01:09:36,621 --> 01:09:41,621
you could see space.
Everybody would want to take a trip to 

1543
01:09:41,621 --> 01:09:41,621
that by a 100 percent.
Yeah.

1544
01:09:41,621 --> 01:09:45,810
For all of us to look at it.
You just got to get away from some of 

1545
01:09:45,810 --> 01:09:45,810
these shitty law where you have some 
amazing pictures,

1546
01:09:46,580 --> 01:09:47,360
man.
Image.

1547
01:09:47,361 --> 01:09:51,950
Go to first.
Is it first image on instagram?

1548
01:09:52,310 --> 01:09:57,310
Adam is not just an amazing bowhunter,
but an amazing photographer just added 

1549
01:09:57,621 --> 01:10:02,621
one that I.
because when you're out there and 

1550
01:10:02,621 --> 01:10:04,640
honestly and like there's no artificial,
there's no light pollution for a long,

1551
01:10:04,641 --> 01:10:09,290
long way.
So if you look closely at that Phsi,

1552
01:10:09,291 --> 01:10:10,730
the,
the orange lights,

1553
01:10:10,731 --> 01:10:13,240
the fire.
But see the clouds in the background,

1554
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:15,560
there's a fun just a campfire that week.

1555
01:10:16,310 --> 01:10:19,660
But if you look behind that,
that's lightning in clouds.

1556
01:10:20,550 --> 01:10:25,550
So I ended up getting the far the 
lightning and in the milky way blazing 

1557
01:10:25,550 --> 01:10:26,450
and for the,
that is an amazing picture.

1558
01:10:27,050 --> 01:10:28,580
That is amazing,
isn't it?

1559
01:10:28,581 --> 01:10:31,580
I'm just a dude.
I can't like I'm there and I don't go to

1560
01:10:31,581 --> 01:10:36,581
sleep til one or 2:00
in the morning cause I'm just lying 

1561
01:10:36,581 --> 01:10:36,581
there looking up.
We'll take photos and I'm just like,

1562
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:40,100
what the out there.
Like how crazy is that?

1563
01:10:40,250 --> 01:10:44,060
That picture is incredible.
That's beautiful.

1564
01:10:44,061 --> 01:10:49,061
So that's over our heads every night.
That's another thing that you just sort 

1565
01:10:49,061 --> 01:10:49,061
of take for granted,
you know?

1566
01:10:49,190 --> 01:10:50,180
Yeah.
And like you said,

1567
01:10:50,181 --> 01:10:52,010
the light pollution.
I mean we just,

1568
01:10:52,011 --> 01:10:53,300
we love cities.
They're nice,

1569
01:10:53,301 --> 01:10:54,320
they give you,
you know,

1570
01:10:54,380 --> 01:10:59,380
supermarkets and restaurants and shit,
but they also ruin your view of the 

1571
01:10:59,380 --> 01:10:59,380
universe.
Totally.

1572
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:04,180
It's not worth it.
Not Worth the trade off is almost not 

1573
01:11:04,180 --> 01:11:08,450
worth it.
Just don't fucking pigs now because with

1574
01:11:08,451 --> 01:11:13,451
so you know,
there's so many options out there and 

1575
01:11:13,451 --> 01:11:13,650
food,
I reckon our taste buds have changed and

1576
01:11:13,651 --> 01:11:14,100
everything.

1577
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:14,790
Gold,
no doubt.

1578
01:11:14,791 --> 01:11:19,260
Our taste buds have changed for sure 
because it's stuffed back then.

1579
01:11:19,261 --> 01:11:24,261
Wouldn't be bland.
But what if you just ate those real 

1580
01:11:24,261 --> 01:11:24,510
simple items now it'd be blamed as hell,
you know,

1581
01:11:24,511 --> 01:11:29,511
I need source on,
I need to put sold aren't need to do 

1582
01:11:29,511 --> 01:11:29,511
this and you're not.
And then yeah,

1583
01:11:29,511 --> 01:11:34,150
just feel like with turn and then the 
frigging pigs because there's so many 

1584
01:11:34,150 --> 01:11:37,011
options for food out there that were 
just keep shoveling and we'd just take 

1585
01:11:37,011 --> 01:11:37,320
it all for granted as well.
One hundred percent.

1586
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:42,380
But I like it.
I like dinner after this we're going to 

1587
01:11:43,111 --> 01:11:44,640
go to a restaurant.
Sit down.

1588
01:11:44,820 --> 01:11:45,570
Yeah,
exactly.

1589
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:50,800
Not.
Think about it and we'll have good is 

1590
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:52,500
that when I come back from this 22 days,
$2 fantasize and over foods,

1591
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:57,850
I put the 17 kilos straight back on.
What were you thinking of?

1592
01:11:57,900 --> 01:11:59,220
Just fucking anything.

1593
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:01,400
It was proposed at one.
Is there one thing you like?

1594
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:05,580
As soon as I had burger burger,
but like a full work burger,

1595
01:12:05,581 --> 01:12:10,320
like a jerk burger that's just packed 
and there's a couple of places that mean

1596
01:12:10,321 --> 01:12:12,710
came usually got home and I was just 
dawn,

1597
01:12:12,870 --> 01:12:17,870
like I'm about to salivate.
So like both the time spent away and the

1598
01:12:20,341 --> 01:12:22,950
time and civilization.
That's the thing is achieving balance.

1599
01:12:22,980 --> 01:12:24,180
Yeah.
It gets getting the balance.

1600
01:12:24,181 --> 01:12:24,780
Yeah,
exactly.

1601
01:12:24,781 --> 01:12:26,790
Yeah.
Because the civilization is awesome.

1602
01:12:26,870 --> 01:12:28,950
It's great to be able to go to a doctor.
Yeah.

1603
01:12:28,951 --> 01:12:31,720
And when you get away from all that and 
you are out in the walls,

1604
01:12:31,790 --> 01:12:33,030
they,
that's huge.

1605
01:12:33,031 --> 01:12:36,060
Fully realized like fuck,
how good do we have it?

1606
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:38,640
Like you hop in a car with air 
conditioning,

1607
01:12:38,641 --> 01:12:42,000
you drive from point a to point b,
like you know,

1608
01:12:42,001 --> 01:12:45,330
and I always think about how life must 
have been back in the day.

1609
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:49,290
Like it wasn't driving from point a to 
point b because I had have taken fucking

1610
01:12:49,291 --> 01:12:52,110
a week dude.
Now you just jumped in the car and go.

1611
01:12:52,340 --> 01:12:56,520
It's all temperature controlled.
You stop at a service station,

1612
01:12:56,521 --> 01:12:58,350
you get fuel,
fucking I'm thirsty.

1613
01:12:58,351 --> 01:12:59,970
I'm going to get a drink while I'm in 
there.

1614
01:13:00,230 --> 01:13:01,620
You know,
like that's just one,

1615
01:13:01,950 --> 01:13:04,250
one example of how crazy it is.
Yeah.

1616
01:13:04,260 --> 01:13:06,840
Now when you are in the Bush,
when you,

1617
01:13:06,841 --> 01:13:11,841
especially when you're an art land,
you find a lot of pictographs and a lot 

1618
01:13:11,841 --> 01:13:12,090
of these.
Yeah.

1619
01:13:12,180 --> 01:13:15,210
Because there was such a huge indigenous
population up there.

1620
01:13:15,211 --> 01:13:16,470
Well there still is,
but you know,

1621
01:13:16,471 --> 01:13:18,780
you're looking at.
I put one up the other day,

1622
01:13:19,290 --> 01:13:20,780
it's a video,
it's just Indians.

1623
01:13:20,790 --> 01:13:25,790
The stories that Jamie might find it,
but a main equals or looking at some 

1624
01:13:25,830 --> 01:13:30,830
paintings and then I looked down and 
like there's a whole human remains 

1625
01:13:30,830 --> 01:13:30,830
tucked in the rocks.

1626
01:13:30,830 --> 01:13:35,240
They're ripe wrapped in pipe.
A box which is a jet pilot back in 

1627
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:35,650
America.
Chocolatory I don't think so.

1628
01:13:35,830 --> 01:13:37,550
Cool.
A pipe voc because it's like the,

1629
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:40,560
the box literally rips off at like a 
soft tissue paper.

1630
01:13:41,190 --> 01:13:43,470
And uh,
so some mobs,

1631
01:13:43,471 --> 01:13:48,471
like indigenous people would rather do 
the indigenous people call like a group 

1632
01:13:48,471 --> 01:13:49,800
of them.
Well you drive here.

1633
01:13:50,060 --> 01:13:53,930
You were talking a mob of hogs earlier,
you said that mobs,

1634
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:57,330
a group of indigenous youth,
that's what they call themselves,

1635
01:13:57,331 --> 01:13:57,630
right?
Yeah,

1636
01:13:57,660 --> 01:13:58,380
that's correct.
Yep.

1637
01:13:58,410 --> 01:14:03,410
Yeah.
So I don't like the term like tribe or 

1638
01:14:03,410 --> 01:14:03,840
anything like that because that's very 
American Indians and things like that.

1639
01:14:03,841 --> 01:14:08,460
So they would say like what they hear.
I wanted to really get into this because

1640
01:14:08,461 --> 01:14:10,170
this is some stuff we talked about at my
house.

1641
01:14:10,190 --> 01:14:13,240
That's your podcast last time.
Oh Wow.

1642
01:14:13,241 --> 01:14:14,920
Look at those pictures.
That's amazing.

1643
01:14:14,980 --> 01:14:19,980
Yeah.
So they real beautiful rights and now a 

1644
01:14:19,980 --> 01:14:22,080
very,
I don't know if I'd call them artistic 

1645
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:22,720
because this just seemed to be what they
did,

1646
01:14:22,721 --> 01:14:25,180
you know,
wherever it's that dream time,

1647
01:14:25,181 --> 01:14:26,470
you would've heard about their dream 
time.

1648
01:14:26,471 --> 01:14:28,570
So wherever it's recording their dream 
time,

1649
01:14:28,930 --> 01:14:29,990
you know,
um,

1650
01:14:30,620 --> 01:14:34,330
the indigenous would do these,
these rock arts and uh,

1651
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:37,800
sometimes I'd be carving.
So if you go to like the Dapi damp,

1652
01:14:37,950 --> 01:14:42,950
but Lego in Western Australia,
which is in the Pilbara region that are 

1653
01:14:42,950 --> 01:14:46,371
all carvings in rock,
like literally scribed in the Rock and 

1654
01:14:46,371 --> 01:14:48,760
um,
the day title that you'd get,

1655
01:14:48,790 --> 01:14:53,790
like,
it's so hard describing a rock that get 

1656
01:14:53,790 --> 01:14:53,790
this detail in this rock that was just 
amazing.

1657
01:14:53,790 --> 01:14:58,670
They use a pioneer with.
I'd grown up different stones and get 

1658
01:14:58,670 --> 01:14:59,450
different textures and colors and see 
those hand prints.

1659
01:14:59,470 --> 01:15:00,910
Those hand prints have been put up.

1660
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,730
Their hands go on the wall and then they
spray it out of their mouth.

1661
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:08,760
So they might like.
And essentially it's like a spray 

1662
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:08,760
painting,
you know,

1663
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:11,110
but they're using their mouth.
Those other ones would be painted on and

1664
01:15:11,380 --> 01:15:13,900
you see some really crazy things.
Like,

1665
01:15:13,901 --> 01:15:15,670
I reckon that's an aim.
You that white thing,

1666
01:15:15,671 --> 01:15:20,671
if you have a good look at it,
there's so many paintings on there 

1667
01:15:20,671 --> 01:15:20,671
that's a picture that I took a couple of
years ago now.

1668
01:15:20,671 --> 01:15:25,561
But there's so many paintings on there 
now that you have to stare at it for a 

1669
01:15:25,561 --> 01:15:25,561
wall and then pick a different one.
Now you know,

1670
01:15:25,561 --> 01:15:28,630
and like there's a documented so these 
ones aren't,

1671
01:15:28,631 --> 01:15:33,631
so I'm one of about two white fellows 
that have been to this area and a 

1672
01:15:34,810 --> 01:15:37,220
traditional able to took a say like a 
traditional loan.

1673
01:15:37,230 --> 01:15:42,230
I took us up there,
she couldn't go up there and 90 raising 

1674
01:15:42,230 --> 01:15:45,760
we were allowed in,
there was because this mob of people 

1675
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:48,991
that they don't exist anymore,
the last of them has passed away so it 

1676
01:15:48,991 --> 01:15:48,991
was okay to go in there.

1677
01:15:48,991 --> 01:15:53,760
So I'm to take you into the full story 
with like beaten down this Bush track 

1678
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:58,531
for hours and hours and we pull up at a 
little creek system and she just sort of

1679
01:15:59,831 --> 01:16:00,820
pointed that out.
She said,

1680
01:16:00,821 --> 01:16:01,450
look,
if you know,

1681
01:16:01,451 --> 01:16:04,270
if you go up to the escarpment air and 
into a cave or whatever,

1682
01:16:04,271 --> 01:16:05,700
you'll see,
you know,

1683
01:16:05,710 --> 01:16:10,710
the,
the artifacts and everything that's out 

1684
01:16:10,710 --> 01:16:10,710
there and this.
So this is untouched.

1685
01:16:10,710 --> 01:16:12,150
Like crazily untouch this spot,
you know,

1686
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:14,170
go in there and it's like a frigging 
lost city,

1687
01:16:14,171 --> 01:16:19,171
but all natural,
like rocks just pushed up out of the 

1688
01:16:19,171 --> 01:16:22,621
ground.
And then you say the mouth of the cave 

1689
01:16:22,621 --> 01:16:24,541
and a couple of paintings on it.
Then you walk into the cave and this 

1690
01:16:24,541 --> 01:16:24,730
cave is 60,
70 meters long.

1691
01:16:25,330 --> 01:16:28,030
It's probably 30 percent or 30 meters 
wide.

1692
01:16:28,630 --> 01:16:33,630
And the roofs probably,
let's say 10 meters tall and the hallway

1693
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:36,850
for this cave systems,
those paintings,

1694
01:16:36,851 --> 01:16:39,580
like he can't ever had,
they even reached the top of the cave.

1695
01:16:39,610 --> 01:16:42,310
Like there's no big rocks or anything 
sitting around anymore.

1696
01:16:42,730 --> 01:16:44,830
They still the grinding stones there,
Joe,

1697
01:16:44,831 --> 01:16:47,020
where they'll grinding up the different 
paints,

1698
01:16:47,050 --> 01:16:48,040
you know,
because that's what they'd do.

1699
01:16:48,041 --> 01:16:53,041
They'd,
they'd grind it up and work it into a 

1700
01:16:53,041 --> 01:16:53,041
paste to paint with.
That's all still sitting there.

1701
01:16:53,410 --> 01:16:57,060
And there's 30 human reminds just 
sitting in the cave in a,

1702
01:16:57,250 --> 01:17:00,040
like in a pile there as well.
And uh,

1703
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:04,710
so the indigenous story goes,
you know,

1704
01:17:04,750 --> 01:17:06,500
and this might be a part of the dream 
time,

1705
01:17:06,501 --> 01:17:09,150
I don't want to get this bit wrong,
but it might be a part of that,

1706
01:17:09,470 --> 01:17:11,480
like a dream time story and how it 
happened.

1707
01:17:11,481 --> 01:17:16,481
But the drain time story is the kids 
descended off the from the cave down 

1708
01:17:17,211 --> 01:17:22,211
onto,
from the escarpment down onto the flat 

1709
01:17:22,211 --> 01:17:22,211
and the kids were told not to kill any 
serpents,

1710
01:17:22,211 --> 01:17:23,460
like don't kill a snake,
you know,

1711
01:17:23,470 --> 01:17:24,500
they're off limits.

1712
01:17:25,220 --> 01:17:30,220
And uh,
the kids go down there and they can't 

1713
01:17:30,220 --> 01:17:31,640
find anything to eat.
And I find a serpent,

1714
01:17:31,641 --> 01:17:36,641
like a young snake.
So they grabbed this knife and cut its 

1715
01:17:36,641 --> 01:17:37,790
head off and it doesn't die.
It keep squiggling and moving around.

1716
01:17:38,330 --> 01:17:39,510
And then,
um,

1717
01:17:39,530 --> 01:17:44,530
so they keep chopping or that they chop 
it into little bits and it keeps 

1718
01:17:44,530 --> 01:17:45,090
squiggling around and won't die.
They bash it with a rock and I won't die

1719
01:17:45,091 --> 01:17:50,091
at keep squiggling around.
Then they fry it in a fire and the fire 

1720
01:17:50,091 --> 01:17:53,271
still doesn't kill it as just in pain 
and squirming and squiggling around 

1721
01:17:53,271 --> 01:17:53,570
there.
And the mother serpent,

1722
01:17:54,270 --> 01:17:59,270
you heard this commotion,
the kids go back up to the escarpment 

1723
01:17:59,270 --> 01:18:01,490
and into the cave.
But the mother serpent comes up and they

1724
01:18:01,491 --> 01:18:06,491
never used to be a creek there.
And she come up with such a rage that 

1725
01:18:06,491 --> 01:18:06,491
she carved the creek through the land.

1726
01:18:06,491 --> 01:18:08,630
So this is how a lot of their dream time
stories go.

1727
01:18:09,230 --> 01:18:14,230
And uh,
so she carved that creek in that were 

1728
01:18:14,230 --> 01:18:14,270
actually camped on.
She went up,

1729
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:16,080
she found the people in the cave after 
fine,

1730
01:18:16,140 --> 01:18:17,480
her,
her young dead,

1731
01:18:17,810 --> 01:18:19,850
and she lead a fly all the way around 
them.

1732
01:18:19,851 --> 01:18:22,880
She raised into the cave and she burned 
them out and she burned them to death.

1733
01:18:23,480 --> 01:18:25,410
So that,
you know,

1734
01:18:25,411 --> 01:18:27,680
that's,
that's the indigenous story.

1735
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:32,960
The,
the white fellow story is the 

1736
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:36,341
indigenous,
and I'm not saying one's true or one's 

1737
01:18:36,341 --> 01:18:37,430
not true,
but I'll tell you how the story goes.

1738
01:18:37,940 --> 01:18:42,940
The white fellow story is,
that was one of the first cattle 

1739
01:18:42,940 --> 01:18:44,840
stations in the northern territory of 
Australia and the indigenous,

1740
01:18:44,841 --> 01:18:48,950
we're picking off cattle to eat and I 
wouldn't have known any different,

1741
01:18:48,951 --> 01:18:49,820
right?
It's an animal.

1742
01:18:50,210 --> 01:18:52,350
Um,
and uh,

1743
01:18:52,490 --> 01:18:55,280
the station owners found this out like a
fan,

1744
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:58,400
that way the indigenous will live in and
I took them food as a gift,

1745
01:18:58,401 --> 01:19:02,240
but it was all laced with poison and 
they end up all dine in the cave.

1746
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:03,320
So,
you know,

1747
01:19:03,321 --> 01:19:05,480
there's two,
two versions of the story,

1748
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:06,690
obviously.
Yeah.

1749
01:19:06,950 --> 01:19:08,840
It's the second one.
Yeah.

1750
01:19:08,841 --> 01:19:10,880
I don't want to say because who frigging
knows,

1751
01:19:10,881 --> 01:19:15,050
but I definitely know that nick isn't 
going around lighting fires.

1752
01:19:16,070 --> 01:19:17,690
Probably not,
but I know what you're saying.

1753
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:23,880
Yeah.
If you listen to enough dream time 

1754
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:23,880
stories,
you know,

1755
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:24,890
and that like that will,
they have for a long time,

1756
01:19:24,891 --> 01:19:27,450
you know,
here that was so hot,

1757
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:29,670
that was so good at hunting because you 
know,

1758
01:19:29,690 --> 01:19:30,530
a lot of people say,
oh,

1759
01:19:30,531 --> 01:19:33,380
the indigenous didn't come up with a bow
and arrow.

1760
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:38,680
They didn't need to like wine events 
aren't and you didn't need that was so 

1761
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:40,060
good with boomerangs and species and you
know,

1762
01:19:40,070 --> 01:19:43,100
the way that they wanted that they 
didn't need a boner.

1763
01:19:43,130 --> 01:19:44,150
You know,
it was insane.

1764
01:19:44,151 --> 01:19:49,151
So there are beautiful rice,
but they're still very young to western 

1765
01:19:49,151 --> 01:19:49,370
society.

1766
01:19:49,370 --> 01:19:51,950
You know,
I think we spoke about this last time.

1767
01:19:51,951 --> 01:19:52,850
Jamie,
can you find it?

1768
01:19:52,851 --> 01:19:57,851
How old?
Well when was like the northern 

1769
01:19:57,851 --> 01:20:01,511
territory of Australia really pioneered 
because that's the population of 

1770
01:20:01,511 --> 01:20:04,781
indigenous that we're talking about.
They've been thrown into this western 

1771
01:20:04,781 --> 01:20:04,781
society,
you know,

1772
01:20:04,781 --> 01:20:07,290
that we have come through slowly with 
that.

1773
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:12,440
That essentially that was still in the 
stone age because you know that that's 

1774
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:14,970
all I needed within territory in 18,
25.

1775
01:20:14,971 --> 01:20:19,971
The area occupied today in the northern 
territory is part of the colony of New 

1776
01:20:19,971 --> 01:20:21,420
South Wales was first settled by 
Europeans in 18,

1777
01:20:21,430 --> 01:20:26,430
24 at Fort Dundas.
Port Essington in 18,

1778
01:20:26,761 --> 01:20:29,340
63 control of the area was given to 
South Australia.

1779
01:20:29,970 --> 01:20:32,190
Isn't that crazy?
It's not even 200 years old,

1780
01:20:32,191 --> 01:20:33,330
dude.
That's crazy.

1781
01:20:33,470 --> 01:20:38,470
Yeah,
and so these people have been there for 

1782
01:20:38,470 --> 01:20:38,470
how many thousands of years before that 
look.

1783
01:20:38,470 --> 01:20:38,470
Look that up too because I don't want to
get it wrong.

1784
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:44,600
One of the things that you were telling 
me that I thought was really 

1785
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:44,600
fascinating,
we were just hanging out at my house was

1786
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:46,330
how many different languages they have.
Yeah,

1787
01:20:46,510 --> 01:20:47,590
yeah.
There's like,

1788
01:20:48,090 --> 01:20:53,090
I think there's over 700 dialects and 
you could literally have a mob of 

1789
01:20:53,090 --> 01:20:57,441
indigenous on this part of the mainland 
and just a little bit further down 

1790
01:20:57,441 --> 01:20:59,520
another mob of indigenous,
and I wouldn't speak the same language,

1791
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:05,000
says the northern northern territory 
provides evidence of settlement around 

1792
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:05,310
60,000
years ago.

1793
01:21:05,311 --> 01:21:10,311
I think it's just been blown right out 
of the water and it's a lot longer than 

1794
01:21:10,311 --> 01:21:10,311
that now.
Really?

1795
01:21:10,311 --> 01:21:11,670
Yep.
Recently?

1796
01:21:11,970 --> 01:21:13,110
Yep.
Just recently.

1797
01:21:13,260 --> 01:21:14,460
Yeah.
I remember reading something.

1798
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:19,960
That's right.
What's the super recently like a week 

1799
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:19,960
ago or so.
Yeah.

1800
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:24,710
Yeah.
And as I'm so now findings to suggest 

1801
01:21:24,710 --> 01:21:27,210
that I'm Egyptian,
come over at some point,

1802
01:21:27,630 --> 01:21:30,750
especially these two brothers and one of
the province is a story that goes.

1803
01:21:30,750 --> 01:21:32,940
One of the brothers was really sick and 
you know,

1804
01:21:32,941 --> 01:21:35,850
he had to look after him and um,
uh,

1805
01:21:36,940 --> 01:21:39,030
I,
I can't remember how it ends,

1806
01:21:39,031 --> 01:21:44,031
but you know,
that Egyptians had come here just 

1807
01:21:44,031 --> 01:21:45,741
because of some of the signs that they 
found in those days was like a story 

1808
01:21:45,741 --> 01:21:46,800
noted down on some rocks and things like
that.

1809
01:21:46,801 --> 01:21:51,801
So it's really crazy.
The history behind Australia when you 

1810
01:21:51,801 --> 01:21:54,741
think of it like that,
and when you think of how young it is 

1811
01:21:54,741 --> 01:21:55,680
here it goes.
Aboriginal architectural discovery in.

1812
01:21:55,681 --> 01:21:57,060
How do you say that word?
Cock.

1813
01:21:57,061 --> 01:21:58,570
I do Kacadoo.
Yep.

1814
01:21:58,650 --> 01:22:01,290
Could do rewrites.
The history of Australia,

1815
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:06,560
northern territory.
Aboriginal people have lived in 

1816
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:06,560
Australia,
a minimum of 65,000

1817
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:08,790
years of chemo,
of archeologist has established 18,000

1818
01:22:08,791 --> 01:22:13,020
years longer than it had been proved 
previously and at least 5,000

1819
01:22:13,021 --> 01:22:16,830
years long that had been speculated by 
the most optimistic researchers.

1820
01:22:17,730 --> 01:22:18,570
Wow.
Crazy.

1821
01:22:18,580 --> 01:22:19,330
I.
Yeah,

1822
01:22:19,410 --> 01:22:22,380
pretty crazy.
It's a long fucking time,

1823
01:22:22,381 --> 01:22:25,920
man.
Pay Five thousand years.

1824
01:22:25,921 --> 01:22:30,921
Today.
The story about the damp Jacoba Lego 

1825
01:22:30,921 --> 01:22:30,921
area in the Pilgra,
that's what I mentioned earlier.

1826
01:22:30,921 --> 01:22:35,190
That's right near where I have my 
business and as I have a 70,000

1827
01:22:35,550 --> 01:22:40,550
rock arts on the archipelago itself.
They still don't know the significance 

1828
01:22:40,550 --> 01:22:41,490
of it.
70,000,

1829
01:22:42,030 --> 01:22:47,030
but there's a story that goes.
The indigenous that lived on the 

1830
01:22:47,030 --> 01:22:50,421
mainland with cy,
much different than the people that 

1831
01:22:50,421 --> 01:22:54,771
lived on the islands like cold on the 
canoe people or the boat people that if 

1832
01:22:54,771 --> 01:22:57,780
those canoe or boat people live or come 
near the mine land,

1833
01:22:58,110 --> 01:23:03,110
the indigenous mob that lived on the 
mainland would clear out of there might 

1834
01:23:03,110 --> 01:23:04,740
get out of it because I was so different
in the way that leave.

1835
01:23:04,741 --> 01:23:09,741
The way they spoke,
the way they looked was so different 

1836
01:23:09,741 --> 01:23:09,741
that it was like a foreign person to.

1837
01:23:09,741 --> 01:23:11,740
I'm now scared of them,
Jesus Christ.

1838
01:23:12,490 --> 01:23:14,560
It's just amazing how many different 
dialects.

1839
01:23:14,620 --> 01:23:16,510
It's insane.
Isn't that what you were saying,

1840
01:23:16,511 --> 01:23:19,690
that you could just go a couple of 
kilometers away and they spoke a totally

1841
01:23:19,691 --> 01:23:21,010
different way?
That's correct.

1842
01:23:21,011 --> 01:23:22,120
Yeah.
I couldn't understand each other.

1843
01:23:22,150 --> 01:23:23,500
Nope.
I couldn't understand each other.

1844
01:23:23,501 --> 01:23:25,210
So,
so with my business,

1845
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:30,240
like I've been very fortunate to work 
closely with a lot of indigenous people 

1846
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:31,580
wherever it's Arnhem land,
um,

1847
01:23:31,870 --> 01:23:36,370
where I go hunting a lot or it's with my
business because in my business I've got

1848
01:23:36,700 --> 01:23:40,030
a joint venture with an indigenous 
business owner,

1849
01:23:40,810 --> 01:23:43,270
which is,
I'm sure she's a lovely woman.

1850
01:23:43,271 --> 01:23:48,271
She's awesome.
And I also have a thing where I employ 

1851
01:23:48,271 --> 01:23:52,831
at least 25 percent indigenous local 
indigenous people and I actually usually

1852
01:23:54,041 --> 01:23:56,220
blow them out the 50 percent at some,
which is,

1853
01:23:56,320 --> 01:23:58,360
which is awesome.
You know the deal,

1854
01:23:58,361 --> 01:24:00,550
it's mandated by a treaty or the 
government.

1855
01:24:00,690 --> 01:24:03,130
Really the,
the mining,

1856
01:24:03,460 --> 01:24:08,460
the mining companies that I work for 
would prefer an indigenous joint venture

1857
01:24:09,581 --> 01:24:13,840
owner of 25 percent.
Then what I've taken on is my,

1858
01:24:13,930 --> 01:24:18,010
for myself is just,
I want the 25 percent or more indigenous

1859
01:24:18,011 --> 01:24:20,320
employees as well,
local indigenous people.

1860
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:23,860
So I've been,
I've been close to a lot of them and you

1861
01:24:23,861 --> 01:24:27,280
hear a lot of their different stories,
but one of the things is um,

1862
01:24:27,880 --> 01:24:32,260
where my business is the man,
the.

1863
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:37,440
Sorry,
the woman has the say in the 

1864
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:37,440
relationship,
everything,

1865
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:38,230
financial,
everything like that.

1866
01:24:38,470 --> 01:24:43,470
But just two hours away the man has,
it's the complete opposite in the main 

1867
01:24:43,470 --> 01:24:45,880
has the site and everything.
So it's just two hours away.

1868
01:24:45,881 --> 01:24:48,730
But anyway,
some of these indigenous,

1869
01:24:49,020 --> 01:24:51,160
you know,
have married into,

1870
01:24:51,490 --> 01:24:53,950
you know,
someone from two hours away,

1871
01:24:54,070 --> 01:24:56,800
like the Pilbara region and they're 
always like,

1872
01:24:56,801 --> 01:24:58,660
oh,
can we move back to onslow?

1873
01:24:58,660 --> 01:25:00,640
Whether we're.
The man gets to say it's really,

1874
01:25:00,970 --> 01:25:05,970
really funny,
but I'm just like that in my 

1875
01:25:05,970 --> 01:25:08,911
relationship.
It's whoever's the most fucking pissed 

1876
01:25:08,911 --> 01:25:09,760
off in the day gets a little bit of 
both.

1877
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:15,560
So That's interesting.
So if they moved then they would switch 

1878
01:25:15,560 --> 01:25:15,560
roles,
switches and that happens all the time.

1879
01:25:15,560 --> 01:25:16,780
So they just accept it.
Yeah.

1880
01:25:16,781 --> 01:25:20,230
They just accept it and the whole tribe 
agrees.

1881
01:25:20,470 --> 01:25:22,940
That's the whole model agrees that never
exists,

1882
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:30,360
doesn't,
it probably doesn't run so smoothly 

1883
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:33,001
there even though he knows that the 
other real and it's really hard for a 

1884
01:25:33,001 --> 01:25:34,990
lot of westerners.
Don't understand.

1885
01:25:35,710 --> 01:25:38,230
He's a solitary one story about uh,
I'll,

1886
01:25:38,390 --> 01:25:41,350
I'll Kevin traditional liner that go 
hunting out on his land.

1887
01:25:41,950 --> 01:25:46,950
He's,
he's been out on camp with me for a 

1888
01:25:46,950 --> 01:25:50,341
couple of weeks and he hasn't had any,
anything about water and like a bit of 

1889
01:25:50,341 --> 01:25:53,050
red meat that I've shot him and stuff 
like that and finish that.

1890
01:25:53,050 --> 01:25:55,000
He's been catching for himself.
Anyway.

1891
01:25:55,001 --> 01:25:58,180
He's got family coming out and he says,
you know,

1892
01:25:58,310 --> 01:26:03,310
it gives them a little grocery list that
they could bring from town for him 

1893
01:26:03,310 --> 01:26:04,540
anyway.
They bring the groceries and like,

1894
01:26:04,750 --> 01:26:09,750
I don't think in la he hasn't know.
He hasn't had anything to really drink 

1895
01:26:09,750 --> 01:26:13,601
or you know,
he's just had the real basic stuff for 

1896
01:26:13,601 --> 01:26:13,601
fair wall.
They get there,

1897
01:26:13,601 --> 01:26:15,840
nothing's been taken out of the bags,
but once I hand it to him,

1898
01:26:15,860 --> 01:26:19,160
I just start reaching whatever he's 
grabbed out reach and like,

1899
01:26:19,161 --> 01:26:24,161
so he got a couple of bottles of coke 
and all the kids and relatives of 

1900
01:26:24,161 --> 01:26:26,180
drinking the coke and like they leave 
and we put about this much coke.

1901
01:26:26,430 --> 01:26:29,840
He gets a pack of cigarettes or lead 
hands going like grab cigarettes.

1902
01:26:29,841 --> 01:26:32,650
He doesn't look at them once.
Like he doesn't go to say no.

1903
01:26:32,680 --> 01:26:37,680
Like I haven't had a smoke for a couple 
of weeks or a drink for a couple of 

1904
01:26:37,680 --> 01:26:39,140
ways.
Doesn't even blink dude or anything.

1905
01:26:39,170 --> 01:26:44,170
Just everyone takes and they just leave 
him with a little bit and all this 

1906
01:26:44,170 --> 01:26:44,170
thinking,
fuck.

1907
01:26:44,170 --> 01:26:44,650
If that was me I'd be like,
Oh boy,

1908
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:49,960
I haven't had frequent cigarette smoke 
but I haven't had a cigarette for a 

1909
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:52,310
couple of weeks.
Like ease up and it didn't bother me one

1910
01:26:52,311 --> 01:26:53,240
bit because that's how I.
Oh,

1911
01:26:53,250 --> 01:26:56,130
but when one of them has something that,
that he doesn't have,

1912
01:26:56,131 --> 01:26:58,880
he's quite welcomed the reach in and 
grab whatever he wants as well.

1913
01:26:58,900 --> 01:27:02,050
They say that was an issue with a native
Americans as well,

1914
01:27:02,051 --> 01:27:03,790
that they didn't understand property.
Yeah.

1915
01:27:03,850 --> 01:27:08,850
Yeah.
Don't understand property and just 

1916
01:27:08,850 --> 01:27:08,850
sharing what they do and it's just 
normal.

1917
01:27:08,850 --> 01:27:10,750
It was this property thing came out of 
the Europeans.

1918
01:27:11,510 --> 01:27:13,750
They didn't understand.
So they would do the same thing,

1919
01:27:13,820 --> 01:27:16,000
would take the animals,
would take the food.

1920
01:27:16,001 --> 01:27:18,790
And it was normal for.
So if someone had left something,

1921
01:27:19,060 --> 01:27:21,760
some of the accounts of European 
settlers were talking about that,

1922
01:27:21,761 --> 01:27:24,350
how native Americans seem to have no 
understanding at all.

1923
01:27:24,700 --> 01:27:26,350
Why people would be upset that they 
would.

1924
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:27,700
Someone would take their problem.
Yeah.

1925
01:27:27,701 --> 01:27:29,310
And you say that in the fuel of the 
movies as

1926
01:27:29,320 --> 01:27:31,830
well that know they've kept that 
dialect.

1927
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:35,400
But um,
the other thing that I was going to cite

1928
01:27:35,550 --> 01:27:40,550
is,
so it's something to be like high 

1929
01:27:40,550 --> 01:27:40,550
ambient,
you know,

1930
01:27:40,550 --> 01:27:43,900
like we,
like we used to talk about going on 

1931
01:27:43,900 --> 01:27:46,660
walkabout and things like that.
Like a lot of the guys that I would get 

1932
01:27:46,660 --> 01:27:49,891
would get their first Pi and then not 
show up to work the next morning and 

1933
01:27:49,980 --> 01:27:53,500
like come back two months later and just
walk straight into the depot.

1934
01:27:53,501 --> 01:27:54,880
Like,
like,

1935
01:27:54,881 --> 01:27:57,310
hey boss.
And I'd be like,

1936
01:27:57,311 --> 01:28:02,311
uh,
I haven't seen you for a couple of 

1937
01:28:02,311 --> 01:28:02,311
months,
might look,

1938
01:28:02,311 --> 01:28:02,311
what are you doing?
I'm here for work.

1939
01:28:02,311 --> 01:28:05,380
Well not obviously because I'd get 
there,

1940
01:28:05,381 --> 01:28:10,381
pay their paycheck and I'd just be happy
and go off with it for those couple of 

1941
01:28:10,381 --> 01:28:11,380
months or whatever.
And they're not all like that.

1942
01:28:11,381 --> 01:28:12,460
But a lot of them would do that.

1943
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:15,160
And it took me a long time to 
understand,

1944
01:28:15,390 --> 01:28:20,390
especially being a business owner and 
just wanting everything to run nice and 

1945
01:28:20,390 --> 01:28:21,520
smooth.
That that's just how a lot of them are,

1946
01:28:21,521 --> 01:28:26,521
you know.
And it is something to be envious about 

1947
01:28:26,521 --> 01:28:28,640
because the other thing that would 
happen is in the mine sites are pushing 

1948
01:28:28,640 --> 01:28:33,091
for indigenous employees at this time 
and I'd load them up with indigenous 

1949
01:28:33,941 --> 01:28:35,320
employees.
Then there'll be a deaf,

1950
01:28:35,640 --> 01:28:39,190
you know,
in the family and a funeral.

1951
01:28:39,191 --> 01:28:43,300
Like they won't bury their dead until 
everyone from the mobs there.

1952
01:28:43,780 --> 01:28:46,260
So and because some of them live so far 
out and Bush,

1953
01:28:46,680 --> 01:28:51,100
it could take a week for a funeral or 
some funerals go for weeks and weeks,

1954
01:28:51,101 --> 01:28:53,320
months dude.
And these guys wouldn't show up.

1955
01:28:53,321 --> 01:28:55,330
And I'd have the client ringing me up 
saying,

1956
01:28:55,620 --> 01:28:56,170
you know,
like,

1957
01:28:56,171 --> 01:28:57,670
what's going on?
You guys aren't here today.

1958
01:28:57,670 --> 01:29:02,670
Well,
if you want indigenous employees and 

1959
01:29:02,670 --> 01:29:02,670
indigenous business,
this what happens in,

1960
01:29:02,670 --> 01:29:04,350
you need to understand their culture 
now.

1961
01:29:04,351 --> 01:29:07,590
There's been a lot of um,
cultural awareness.

1962
01:29:08,060 --> 01:29:11,670
Um,
a lot of cultural awareness has gone out

1963
01:29:11,671 --> 01:29:15,030
there to the mine sites that now they're
all understanding that as well.

1964
01:29:15,031 --> 01:29:20,031
So they know if there's a funeral on 
that they're not going to have their 

1965
01:29:20,031 --> 01:29:22,581
indigenous people there anymore.
So the indigenous people have an 

1966
01:29:22,581 --> 01:29:22,581
adjusted.
No,

1967
01:29:22,581 --> 01:29:22,581
they haven't.
No.

1968
01:29:22,581 --> 01:29:24,960
They have to a certain degree on some 
things,

1969
01:29:24,961 --> 01:29:26,940
but not a lot.
And I shouldn't have to worry about.

1970
01:29:27,470 --> 01:29:27,800
Yeah.

1971
01:29:28,950 --> 01:29:30,750
But when they take off,
they don't get paid.

1972
01:29:32,680 --> 01:29:37,680
You got to get work,
goes off on a walkabout and comes back 

1973
01:29:39,391 --> 01:29:40,950
two months later.
Did you just take them back in?

1974
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:42,150
Oh,
I am now.

1975
01:29:42,151 --> 01:29:47,151
Yeah.
We usually do just because it's just 

1976
01:29:47,151 --> 01:29:47,970
cultural awareness.
I'm aware of how their culture is.

1977
01:29:47,971 --> 01:29:51,240
And that's interesting because uh,
when,

1978
01:29:51,300 --> 01:29:56,300
whenever an invasive culture moves into 
an indigenous culture because this 

1979
01:29:56,640 --> 01:29:57,480
battle,
right?

1980
01:29:58,070 --> 01:30:01,150
Try to figure out whose,
whose lifestyle winds out.

1981
01:30:01,151 --> 01:30:03,510
Yep.
And that's decimated the native American

1982
01:30:03,530 --> 01:30:08,530
and I'm thinking all of the cities and 
more populated places in Australia 

1983
01:30:08,530 --> 01:30:10,100
definitely has,
you know,

1984
01:30:10,101 --> 01:30:15,101
but I've just been lucky enough to go 
into some of these remote areas where 

1985
01:30:15,101 --> 01:30:15,200
that's not the case still.
Yeah.

1986
01:30:15,650 --> 01:30:20,650
And like I said,
you look in on them and you're just 

1987
01:30:20,650 --> 01:30:20,650
like,
I wish I could live my life like that.

1988
01:30:20,650 --> 01:30:25,150
It's like they don't want,
I don't want some of the things that we 

1989
01:30:25,150 --> 01:30:25,150
want,
you know?

1990
01:30:25,380 --> 01:30:26,810
Yes.
They probably.

1991
01:30:27,170 --> 01:30:27,800
Well,
I don't know.

1992
01:30:27,860 --> 01:30:30,530
I mean maybe they envy some of the ways 
that we live as well.

1993
01:30:30,610 --> 01:30:34,320
I don't fucking think so.
I think some of them do.

1994
01:30:35,340 --> 01:30:38,000
Yeah.
But I look at them out there out Bush,

1995
01:30:38,001 --> 01:30:43,001
you know,
like when their ride out and it's just 

1996
01:30:43,001 --> 01:30:43,001
like this is the way law should be 
lived.

1997
01:30:43,001 --> 01:30:44,870
It's like there's no rush to do anything
cold,

1998
01:30:44,900 --> 01:30:47,810
get anywhere and just they just live in 
life.

1999
01:30:47,811 --> 01:30:48,140
Dude.

2000
01:30:48,640 --> 01:30:52,660
Well that's how you like to live too.
I mean you like to like just be out like

2001
01:30:52,661 --> 01:30:57,661
when you're at your cabin,
spent a tremendous amount of time at 

2002
01:30:57,661 --> 01:31:00,720
your cabin just out hunting.
Pretty chill now.

2003
01:31:00,770 --> 01:31:05,770
That's the thing about where you live.
I mean you have so many invasive 

2004
01:31:05,770 --> 01:31:05,770
species,
so much,

2005
01:31:05,770 --> 01:31:09,640
so many deer and pigs.
You could just go like that.

2006
01:31:09,641 --> 01:31:11,500
Yeah,
it's amazing.

2007
01:31:11,530 --> 01:31:13,300
Yeah.
So I do get to hunt a lot.

2008
01:31:13,340 --> 01:31:15,580
So you just eat wild game constantly.
Yeah,

2009
01:31:15,581 --> 01:31:20,430
pretty much like your wedding mouth laid
out.

2010
01:31:20,810 --> 01:31:23,020
Woo.
She's wild pork.

2011
01:31:23,990 --> 01:31:26,340
Hi.
Those like meatballs which are like,

2012
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:30,700
which was like a deer pig mix for like 
three days.

2013
01:31:30,701 --> 01:31:31,660
Dude.
God,

2014
01:31:31,720 --> 01:31:32,830
breakfast,
lunch and dinner.

2015
01:31:33,070 --> 01:31:34,390
So good.
All that wild.

2016
01:31:34,650 --> 01:31:35,800
It was awesome.
And it was,

2017
01:31:35,860 --> 01:31:39,070
it was an awesome experience to go out,
harvest that,

2018
01:31:39,071 --> 01:31:41,200
meet me self,
then put it on for like 60,

2019
01:31:41,201 --> 01:31:43,230
70 people at the wedding.
Yeah,

2020
01:31:43,290 --> 01:31:44,200
it was cool.
I'm like,

2021
01:31:44,201 --> 01:31:48,070
this is from right here.
Like right here off the farm.

2022
01:31:48,370 --> 01:31:49,380
That's crazy.
Yeah.

2023
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:50,040
Yeah.
No,

2024
01:31:50,050 --> 01:31:52,920
you're living man.
You need to come over dude.

2025
01:31:52,950 --> 01:31:56,890
You've got to kill all those bugs first 
to say that Scorpion,

2026
01:31:56,891 --> 01:32:00,880
that Brittany know,
because I've always been like,

2027
01:32:00,881 --> 01:32:05,881
I'd actually never been bitten.
I got bitten by a spider on the arm 

2028
01:32:05,881 --> 01:32:06,490
once.
What's an orb spider?

2029
01:32:06,520 --> 01:32:09,670
They're not too bad,
but like this side went numb.

2030
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:11,110
We'll at least saw idea.
Okay.

2031
01:32:11,111 --> 01:32:12,240
That's bad dude.
Yeah.

2032
01:32:12,250 --> 01:32:15,320
But it's not like bad luck.
It's going to kill you real sick.

2033
01:32:17,460 --> 01:32:22,090
So jerk off the day before the wedding.
Yeah.

2034
01:32:22,091 --> 01:32:23,810
That's a god.
No,

2035
01:32:24,280 --> 01:32:27,010
he's,
that's the fellow they had beat me,

2036
01:32:28,690 --> 01:32:31,980
but they're not so they're not too bad,
but I'd never looked up.

2037
01:32:31,981 --> 01:32:36,981
Um,
I've never looked up scorpions before 

2038
01:32:36,981 --> 01:32:40,171
because I've never been bitten mine.
And I've just heard a few rumors that 

2039
01:32:40,171 --> 01:32:40,480
you can get really sick from the little 
ones.

2040
01:32:40,780 --> 01:32:42,810
And I picked up a bit of timber walls 
building,

2041
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:47,880
like the bond that I was doing,
an original photo was just a splinter 

2042
01:32:47,880 --> 01:32:51,421
that cracked me and then do this hand 
felt like it was about 10 times the 

2043
01:32:51,421 --> 01:32:52,360
size,
like in 20 seconds,

2044
01:32:52,361 --> 01:32:54,640
his hand just felt like it was just 
swelling up.

2045
01:32:54,700 --> 01:32:56,200
It wasn't,
it looked fine,

2046
01:32:56,201 --> 01:32:58,600
but then you could see my veins popping 
out.

2047
01:32:58,601 --> 01:33:02,090
You could feel the like the poison 
running up me arm.

2048
01:33:02,091 --> 01:33:03,230
It come all about these,
um,

2049
01:33:03,350 --> 01:33:08,350
sort of disappeared once I got into my 
chest and like I ran over to the cabin 

2050
01:33:08,350 --> 01:33:08,560
with me Buddy Antonio there.

2051
01:33:08,980 --> 01:33:11,920
I'm like fucking lookup Scorpion Bites 
right now.

2052
01:33:11,921 --> 01:33:14,530
Like one just cracked me and it's 
excruciating.

2053
01:33:15,100 --> 01:33:16,960
And uh,
he looked it up and he's like,

2054
01:33:16,990 --> 01:33:19,450
worst case scenario,
have a cardiac arrest.

2055
01:33:19,451 --> 01:33:21,910
But it's in very limited cases.
So I'm like,

2056
01:33:21,911 --> 01:33:23,080
well,
what's the normal case?

2057
01:33:23,081 --> 01:33:26,080
And it's just excruciating pain for up 
to two or three days,

2058
01:33:26,350 --> 01:33:28,130
two or three days.
Anyway,

2059
01:33:28,150 --> 01:33:30,490
once it got into my chest,
it sort of disappeared.

2060
01:33:30,580 --> 01:33:33,220
I did feel a bit nauseous and stuff like
that.

2061
01:33:33,550 --> 01:33:38,550
But then two,
I am in the morning that drifted down 

2062
01:33:38,550 --> 01:33:40,270
into these leg on the opposite side,
like woke me up like it was just killing

2063
01:33:40,271 --> 01:33:42,130
me.
Like you little fucker there.

2064
01:33:42,131 --> 01:33:45,220
Only this fucking big too so I can pick 
a punch.

2065
01:33:45,221 --> 01:33:46,150
Yeah,
about an inch long.

2066
01:33:46,630 --> 01:33:50,300
Just a tiny little thing like that.
That didn't happen to me thing.

2067
01:33:50,330 --> 01:33:53,280
Christ necrosis.
Yeah.

2068
01:33:53,500 --> 01:33:56,880
But I understand you can like it you,
it's not,

2069
01:33:56,980 --> 01:33:59,380
not freaking good,
but the day of the wedding,

2070
01:33:59,381 --> 01:34:04,381
while we're all getting ready to meet 
good friend Ben Chambers was there all 

2071
01:34:04,381 --> 01:34:07,930
have a freaking building sentence deal 
or whatever I was doing and I hear a bit

2072
01:34:07,931 --> 01:34:08,440
of commotion.

2073
01:34:08,440 --> 01:34:10,390
I look over,
he's frigging wrestling,

2074
01:34:10,410 --> 01:34:15,410
have to spotted blue belly black snake,
which we've actually never had on the 

2075
01:34:16,031 --> 01:34:19,420
property before.
And they really aggressive like,

2076
01:34:20,440 --> 01:34:22,510
hey,
sorta tried to hold it out of a.

2077
01:34:22,510 --> 01:34:27,510
So I couldn't latch back and get him.
Like I've got all these people showing 

2078
01:34:27,510 --> 01:34:27,700
up for a wedding and there was a 
frigging venomous snake running around.

2079
01:34:27,750 --> 01:34:29,700
Venice is a black snake.
Uh,

2080
01:34:29,770 --> 01:34:34,210
I've heard that they give you a real bad
migraine but they can do the sign,

2081
01:34:34,211 --> 01:34:34,900
like,
you know,

2082
01:34:34,930 --> 01:34:37,810
you can have cardiac arrest,
you can have a bad reaction to it.

2083
01:34:37,811 --> 01:34:39,670
So there's a lot of shit that can go on 
there.

2084
01:34:40,150 --> 01:34:45,150
But um,
my eight grabs this stick and a red 

2085
01:34:45,150 --> 01:34:45,150
belly,
black snake,

2086
01:34:45,150 --> 01:34:49,861
wackier and then usually let go these 
things in the Torres for grabbing you 

2087
01:34:49,861 --> 01:34:54,211
and just pumping you with venom.
That's what makes them the worst of the 

2088
01:34:54,211 --> 01:34:54,211
black snakes.

2089
01:34:54,211 --> 01:34:55,420
Now just grab onto you and keep pumping 
you with venom and they won't,

2090
01:34:55,480 --> 01:34:59,240
they won't do a drive by it.
A lot of snakes do a drive by it and uh,

2091
01:34:59,270 --> 01:35:04,270
but anyway,
this is like the friggen an hour away 

2092
01:35:04,270 --> 01:35:04,830
from the wedding started dude.
And he's tangled in this snake up random

2093
01:35:05,030 --> 01:35:10,030
stick.
Then he lets it go like further away 

2094
01:35:10,030 --> 01:35:12,860
from the cabin and when he lets it go,
it spews up a bloody brown snake.

2095
01:35:12,861 --> 01:35:15,130
And I sent you a video once before have 
a snakes.

2096
01:35:15,220 --> 01:35:17,350
We went up another snake,
this thing,

2097
01:35:17,530 --> 01:35:22,530
beautiful full brands,
Nike and then took all snakes are super 

2098
01:35:22,530 --> 01:35:22,530
poisonous.
Exactly.

2099
01:35:22,530 --> 01:35:27,161
Yes.
I probably should have left it alive 

2100
01:35:27,161 --> 01:35:27,161
because it's taken care of the brand's 
native population.

2101
01:35:27,161 --> 01:35:31,280
It has a taste for what kills.
You shouldn't lift the pride as a 

2102
01:35:31,280 --> 01:35:31,280
cabinet.
I mean,

2103
01:35:31,280 --> 01:35:31,600
if it only gives you a headache.

2104
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:33,770
Yeah,
but most of the time,

2105
01:35:34,460 --> 01:35:38,510
like in Australia and I've like,
I've walked thousands of miles,

2106
01:35:38,511 --> 01:35:38,930
dude.
No,

2107
01:35:38,931 --> 01:35:40,460
never,
ever had a problem.

2108
01:35:41,090 --> 01:35:44,270
That's why you need to come out.
Boy,

2109
01:35:44,271 --> 01:35:46,260
that's not a convincing argument.
Count.

2110
01:35:46,310 --> 01:35:48,380
Come visit the farm.
I'll take you out to the cabinet.

2111
01:35:48,381 --> 01:35:49,790
Sounds good.
Can I get an armored suit?

2112
01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:51,960
Kevlar,
underwear.

2113
01:35:53,790 --> 01:35:58,160
It seems like a terrible idea.
I brought you that buffalo skull because

2114
01:35:58,161 --> 01:35:59,780
I'm like,
you're fucking never coming,

2115
01:36:00,020 --> 01:36:02,080
so I'm always bringing you one of them.
White buffaloes.

2116
01:36:02,240 --> 01:36:03,680
I would come to Australia.
I just.

2117
01:36:03,681 --> 01:36:06,490
I'm not going buffalo hunting.
You guys are out of your fucking mind.

2118
01:36:06,491 --> 01:36:08,870
You pretty safe.
Pretty safe.

2119
01:36:08,871 --> 01:36:10,420
No crocodiles.
Rock it out.

2120
01:36:10,700 --> 01:36:15,050
Is that the snake?
So that's a red belly things beautiful.

2121
01:36:15,080 --> 01:36:18,320
He is pissed off seats.
Flattening these neck out like that.

2122
01:36:18,440 --> 01:36:19,670
God,
it's so beautiful.

2123
01:36:19,700 --> 01:36:20,750
Yeah.
That's a red belly.

2124
01:36:20,751 --> 01:36:22,560
Black staff.
They're pretty harmless.

2125
01:36:23,460 --> 01:36:28,460
So pretty.
I've actually had me head back on the 

2126
01:36:28,460 --> 01:36:31,811
stick before and I had it was cold rod 
up beyond me head and they'll lift up 

2127
01:36:31,811 --> 01:36:34,030
and have a look in the grass and he 
lifted right up beside me on my mood.

2128
01:36:34,170 --> 01:36:37,130
I don't want to get bit and then he just
relaxed and chilled out.

2129
01:36:37,610 --> 01:36:40,640
So you just had to just lay that second 
from the left.

2130
01:36:40,641 --> 01:36:45,641
Jamie.
That looks like a spot is that says this

2131
01:36:45,970 --> 01:36:48,260
says blue bell in here,
but you much much of it.

2132
01:36:48,290 --> 01:36:49,520
Yeah.
That's one.

2133
01:36:49,521 --> 01:36:53,210
That bright shiny black box to the right
click on these.

2134
01:36:53,310 --> 01:36:58,310
They just stopped all those videos.
That is a gorgeous creature.

2135
01:36:58,910 --> 01:37:01,880
It's not uncommon to see a few of them 
for the summer boy hunting,

2136
01:37:01,881 --> 01:37:03,110
but they,
like I said,

2137
01:37:03,111 --> 01:37:05,830
they really placid.
So those are set.

2138
01:37:05,900 --> 01:37:09,150
But how the fuck do you do me a favor 
while you look at it.

2139
01:37:10,310 --> 01:37:13,310
Andrew equals.
I saw this thing on your instagram.

2140
01:37:13,580 --> 01:37:16,670
Yeah.
And then you'll find him on youtube.

2141
01:37:17,540 --> 01:37:19,730
Then he's got these video where he 
catches,

2142
01:37:19,790 --> 01:37:24,790
I think it's two brown snakes and a red 
belly black snake and he puts them down 

2143
01:37:24,921 --> 01:37:28,700
rabbit holes and then they chased the 
rabbits out electronic.

2144
01:37:28,701 --> 01:37:33,701
They trying to get shelter.
They chased these rabbits out and he 

2145
01:37:33,701 --> 01:37:33,800
ended up catching the rabbits.
It's frigging hilarious.

2146
01:37:33,950 --> 01:37:35,470
So he uses either.
He's like,

2147
01:37:35,480 --> 01:37:37,430
he's older videos.
I just seen it.

2148
01:37:37,431 --> 01:37:38,000
That one there.
Do.

2149
01:37:38,010 --> 01:37:41,300
I mean the top one?
Just the one or the one above it.

2150
01:37:42,080 --> 01:37:47,080
This one here,
he's doing something wild rabbits with 

2151
01:37:47,080 --> 01:37:47,080
thinks not it.
Nah,

2152
01:37:47,510 --> 01:37:50,960
that one day.
This dude's a freak.

2153
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:55,100
Hey.
Hey Holly.

2154
01:37:55,320 --> 01:37:56,880
Shit.
That was a few years ago.

2155
01:37:57,010 --> 01:37:59,670
It was pretty Australian.
He's various drained.

2156
01:38:00,210 --> 01:38:04,380
I can't keep doing this shit.
Your fucking numbers coming up rather.

2157
01:38:04,680 --> 01:38:06,330
So these snakes are what kind of snakes?

2158
01:38:07,280 --> 01:38:09,620
Dave to red belly.
Black snake.

2159
01:38:09,621 --> 01:38:12,060
So those will kill you?
Nah,

2160
01:38:12,170 --> 01:38:14,280
I won't kill you.
Those or had a bad reaction.

2161
01:38:14,281 --> 01:38:15,040
Yeah.
Their headaches.

2162
01:38:15,041 --> 01:38:19,380
Snakes and making them.
Well one of them's try and do.

2163
01:38:19,381 --> 01:38:21,800
Now it's getting a bit revved up.
Yeah,

2164
01:38:21,820 --> 01:38:24,420
me just walking around.
He's got some serious control.

2165
01:38:24,421 --> 01:38:27,060
So when they lift up the strike,
he drops them down a little bit,

2166
01:38:27,080 --> 01:38:32,080
you know,
because I can't fight against their own 

2167
01:38:32,080 --> 01:38:33,771
weight like that can grab it.
He just saw gun in his hand.

2168
01:38:40,770 --> 01:38:43,470
What the fuck is wrong with this?
This is your buddy?

2169
01:38:43,530 --> 01:38:44,280
Yeah,
he's my buddy.

2170
01:38:44,281 --> 01:38:46,020
He's a bowhunter now.
He doesn't hunt.

2171
01:38:46,410 --> 01:38:51,410
Why should he high?
Just fucking hands while he's wearing 

2172
01:38:51,410 --> 01:38:51,960
gym shorts.
Dude.

2173
01:38:52,240 --> 01:38:55,950
He's just done Africa maybe a couple of 
years ago.

2174
01:38:55,951 --> 01:38:58,710
He chases a pride of lions off a fucking
kill.

2175
01:38:58,950 --> 01:39:01,940
What chase is the product lines?
Bluffs amount.

2176
01:39:02,420 --> 01:39:05,160
It has elephants chasing him down,
dude.

2177
01:39:05,161 --> 01:39:10,161
And he outruns elephants in sign.
Does he have a death wish?

2178
01:39:11,400 --> 01:39:13,290
He must have.
Do you think he does either.

2179
01:39:15,120 --> 01:39:17,000
He's got some screws loose.
At least.

2180
01:39:17,640 --> 01:39:19,140
Can you identify the taste of.

2181
01:39:21,980 --> 01:39:23,520
Oh,
I've been there before.

2182
01:39:23,960 --> 01:39:25,290
It says.
Yeah.

2183
01:39:25,320 --> 01:39:27,910
So he drops his snakes down the dry run 
out?

2184
01:39:27,940 --> 01:39:29,320
Yeah,
he drops him down the hall.

2185
01:39:29,360 --> 01:39:31,770
What he does is he grabs a rabbit.
Rabbit rabbit.

2186
01:39:31,771 --> 01:39:33,840
Yeah.
So he has run into a net.

2187
01:39:33,841 --> 01:39:35,790
I'm not sure.
One or the other.

2188
01:39:36,530 --> 01:39:41,530
Yeah.
I just watched him wrestle a full size 

2189
01:39:41,530 --> 01:39:43,350
bull buffalo what?
Yeah,

2190
01:39:43,380 --> 01:39:47,330
he pretty much.
He lasted this bull and on film.

2191
01:39:47,340 --> 01:39:50,210
And this is on this last buffalo.
A water buffalo.

2192
01:39:50,280 --> 01:39:55,280
The one that you fuck her.
He lasted.

2193
01:39:55,281 --> 01:39:57,370
Is One of those.
But because the hair,

2194
01:39:57,380 --> 01:39:59,820
the horns are,
you kind of get the last one hone.

2195
01:39:59,830 --> 01:40:02,880
So it comes off my um,
I've got along video.

2196
01:40:02,940 --> 01:40:05,360
It misses him by.
I don't,

2197
01:40:05,430 --> 01:40:08,490
I recognize a couple of feet.
This thing is on his ass,

2198
01:40:08,491 --> 01:40:09,990
but he can run.
But I'm like,

2199
01:40:10,200 --> 01:40:11,160
dude,
one trip.

2200
01:40:11,161 --> 01:40:12,570
And you fuck the.

2201
01:40:14,010 --> 01:40:16,980
How fast is the water buffalo?
Fast off the mom.

2202
01:40:17,490 --> 01:40:22,490
It might just the head like,
just the white in the head could squish 

2203
01:40:23,100 --> 01:40:26,010
your body in half if it got you against 
the grant or a tree.

2204
01:40:26,280 --> 01:40:28,980
So I imagined the rest of it's whole 
body white grown.

2205
01:40:28,981 --> 01:40:30,870
And you do to turn you in the and 
pepper.

2206
01:40:31,020 --> 01:40:33,300
What's the end game for this guy?
What's he doing this for?

2207
01:40:33,610 --> 01:40:38,610
A thrill.
I think I've done some stuff with them 

2208
01:40:38,610 --> 01:40:38,940
out there.
A backpack done.

2209
01:40:39,010 --> 01:40:41,810
So look at this monkey having a root in 
the back.

2210
01:40:43,500 --> 01:40:47,850
This is Africa,
this sample clip.

2211
01:40:48,210 --> 01:40:50,960
What is he doing?
He's Kinda chased one of the baboons.

2212
01:40:52,290 --> 01:40:53,150
Fuck.
Oh,

2213
01:40:53,290 --> 01:40:54,370
Jesus Christ.

2214
01:40:55,990 --> 01:40:58,750
Why is he chasing baboons?
Traveling's will fuck you up.

2215
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:02,840
A nearly dies on this trip.
Something by it.

2216
01:41:02,870 --> 01:41:03,810
More funding.
Get some.

2217
01:41:03,830 --> 01:41:08,830
Oh my God.
So he just chased off all these baboons 

2218
01:41:08,830 --> 01:41:08,830
by running at him.
This is not seemed.

2219
01:41:08,830 --> 01:41:13,661
Why's that?
What concerns me more than anything is 

2220
01:41:13,661 --> 01:41:15,520
that other people are going to copy.
This guy is 100 with thin.

2221
01:41:15,550 --> 01:41:18,400
Yeah.
Because he obviously is very skilled.

2222
01:41:18,520 --> 01:41:20,770
I mean if you could call it skilled,
knowledgeable.

2223
01:41:20,830 --> 01:41:22,630
What's the word?
He's done it before.

2224
01:41:22,631 --> 01:41:26,550
He's experienced shit.
He comes to Christ.

2225
01:41:26,580 --> 01:41:30,980
Hooky.
Tenanting took a.

2226
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:36,730
he's got no shirt on folks.
He's wearing gym shorts and he's uh,

2227
01:41:36,910 --> 01:41:41,910
he's.
Can you give me some volume so I can 

2228
01:41:41,910 --> 01:41:41,910
hear this crazy.
Fuck talk

2229
01:41:42,380 --> 01:41:45,400
in that last little bit of footage.
You can see me rolling on the ground.

2230
01:41:45,670 --> 01:41:50,670
Old Close.
But even in these animals understand 

2231
01:41:50,670 --> 01:41:53,490
that they understand one,
look at me with my two legs,

2232
01:41:53,670 --> 01:41:56,790
two arms standing upright.
My vision forward.

2233
01:41:57,030 --> 01:41:59,460
These animals understand that I'm a 
potential threat to them.

2234
01:41:59,550 --> 01:42:01,350
I'm not food on the friend.

2235
01:42:02,890 --> 01:42:07,890
A fresh fuck.
Crazy fucking crazy.

2236
01:42:07,950 --> 01:42:10,500
One of those lines.
Just the guy just needs the guy.

2237
01:42:10,501 --> 01:42:13,500
No,
you're fucking not been travel.

2238
01:42:13,590 --> 01:42:18,590
I'm ready to put this down.
That tissue paper skin that we have 

2239
01:42:18,590 --> 01:42:19,920
covered the fucking water balloon and 
blood.

2240
01:42:19,970 --> 01:42:24,030
We call a body.
They used to tear and open like freaking

2241
01:42:24,060 --> 01:42:29,060
buffalo and shit.
Shit ain't nothing man.

2242
01:42:29,340 --> 01:42:31,380
Oh Jesus.
What is he doing?

2243
01:42:31,470 --> 01:42:36,470
Why is he have a crocodile?
Why is he putting the last around a 

2244
01:42:36,470 --> 01:42:37,860
fucking crocodile?
This guy's crazy defeated to coconut.

2245
01:42:38,490 --> 01:42:39,790
He fed it a coconut.
Yeah.

2246
01:42:40,080 --> 01:42:45,080
Mind defeated a coconut.
Why not like to put it in its mouth so 

2247
01:42:45,080 --> 01:42:45,380
it can't bite?
Okay,

2248
01:42:45,400 --> 01:42:48,420
give me some volume as crazy.
They must be in Africa because you can't

2249
01:42:52,350 --> 01:42:53,470
stay.
Says,

2250
01:42:54,330 --> 01:42:56,360
this is what I did.
The same thing.

2251
01:42:56,390 --> 01:42:57,750
I started talking to animals and I'm 
like,

2252
01:42:57,990 --> 01:43:00,030
fucking like,
they don't understand English.

2253
01:43:00,031 --> 01:43:02,370
There's no use telling him to calm down.
I'm not fucking eight year.

2254
01:43:02,380 --> 01:43:03,210
If the student doesn't even have

2255
01:43:04,310 --> 01:43:09,310
pushover.
Crocodile is around three and a half 

2256
01:43:09,310 --> 01:43:12,720
thousand pounds.
Compare this to us humans and it's only 

2257
01:43:12,720 --> 01:43:16,710
200 pounds and you'll soon realize why 
this guy was a title as niche as boss.

2258
01:43:24,580 --> 01:43:29,580
Crazy fucker has a coconut in the 
crocodiles mouth and he's trying to get 

2259
01:43:29,581 --> 01:43:31,800
the crocodile,
the crack a coconut for forum.

2260
01:43:32,520 --> 01:43:35,910
Oh my God,
dude,

2261
01:43:35,911 --> 01:43:36,930
he's,
he's,

2262
01:43:37,110 --> 01:43:38,120
he's awesome.
You know.

2263
01:43:38,310 --> 01:43:43,310
So what does this do for a living?
Fucking youtube and stuff for the 

2264
01:43:44,150 --> 01:43:45,400
network.
Tickle,

2265
01:43:45,410 --> 01:43:46,410
tickle,
tickle.

2266
01:43:47,120 --> 01:43:49,590
He's actually a real moment to tell you 
the truth.

2267
01:43:49,830 --> 01:43:52,040
Really just lives in the bush.
Yeah,

2268
01:43:53,270 --> 01:43:55,100
Jesus.
But I mean,

2269
01:43:55,101 --> 01:43:57,930
doesn't have to feed himself like he a 
job.

2270
01:43:58,150 --> 01:44:01,930
Hayes,
he doesn't cry the shit he's about to do

2271
01:44:01,931 --> 01:44:06,760
some massive trek dude with nothing and 
just walk through some wild country.

2272
01:44:08,230 --> 01:44:13,230
And so one of the reasons why he was 
anonymously and with me up north was 

2273
01:44:14,171 --> 01:44:17,410
he's trying to learn off the indigenous 
about a lot of the Bush Tucker luck.

2274
01:44:17,411 --> 01:44:19,240
A lot of the food that he can find out 
in the bush,

2275
01:44:19,690 --> 01:44:22,870
like yams and different like fruits and 
stuff like that.

2276
01:44:23,470 --> 01:44:25,780
He knows all the wildlife stuff that he 
can eat,

2277
01:44:26,110 --> 01:44:28,780
but the indigenous has spent,
you know,

2278
01:44:29,410 --> 01:44:34,410
a long time trying to work out what they
can incarnate and there's heaps of 

2279
01:44:34,410 --> 01:44:38,611
things that you can eat,
but they've got to be boiled for a 

2280
01:44:38,611 --> 01:44:40,561
certain amount of period.
You can only eight to this far into it 

2281
01:44:40,561 --> 01:44:41,740
and things like that.
I've watched you fucking cock at dude.

2282
01:44:42,130 --> 01:44:43,360
There's a,
there's a,

2283
01:44:43,770 --> 01:44:47,200
I don't know if it's a route or type of 
fruit and you definitely can't eat it,

2284
01:44:47,590 --> 01:44:52,590
like crush it up and they put it in the 
water and it takes a lot of the water 

2285
01:44:52,590 --> 01:44:52,590
and all the fish float.
Oh,

2286
01:44:52,590 --> 01:44:53,830
I've seen that in South American.
Yeah,

2287
01:44:53,831 --> 01:44:56,440
I got yet.
So imagine how long it took to work out.

2288
01:44:56,441 --> 01:44:58,330
That actually looked like.
That's crazy,

2289
01:44:58,331 --> 01:44:58,630
isn't it?

2290
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:02,070
That's another thing that they eat in 
Bolivia.

2291
01:45:02,860 --> 01:45:04,220
Casaba.
Yeah.

2292
01:45:04,221 --> 01:45:05,220
I've never heard of that.
I haven't.

2293
01:45:05,230 --> 01:45:08,700
No.
It's a route that if you eat it raw,

2294
01:45:09,090 --> 01:45:14,090
it's super toxic as a whole really 
involved process where you have to.

2295
01:45:15,330 --> 01:45:20,330
You have to soak it and then you have to
drain it very similar and then it turns 

2296
01:45:22,720 --> 01:45:26,070
into A.
There's actually Sinai that comes out of

2297
01:45:26,071 --> 01:45:26,220
it.

2298
01:45:27,730 --> 01:45:30,610
Yeah.
See if you can find a video,

2299
01:45:30,640 --> 01:45:35,640
Jamie,
on preparation of Casaba and this 

2300
01:45:35,640 --> 01:45:38,470
cassava is apparently Rinella was 
telling me about it.

2301
01:45:38,471 --> 01:45:42,580
That's what it was.
I had read about it before,

2302
01:45:42,581 --> 01:45:47,581
but Rinella was telling me how poisonous
it is that the stuff that they like,

2303
01:45:48,910 --> 01:45:53,910
but that good.
That's like birth gay lover.

2304
01:45:54,400 --> 01:45:56,410
That's what it looks like.
So,

2305
01:45:56,411 --> 01:45:57,770
um,
they,

2306
01:45:57,870 --> 01:46:00,170
they have these buckets around the camp 
fire.

2307
01:46:00,280 --> 01:46:02,500
You've got to find a better video than 
this.

2308
01:46:02,501 --> 01:46:03,320
This cat.
So good.

2309
01:46:03,370 --> 01:46:05,070
All the rest of her recipes that.
I mean,

2310
01:46:05,080 --> 01:46:07,490
some of those preparing.
Yeah.

2311
01:46:08,200 --> 01:46:11,980
Well there's a really involved process 
in order to cook it.

2312
01:46:12,870 --> 01:46:13,690
Yeah.
So yeah,

2313
01:46:13,710 --> 01:46:16,080
you get it right or you're dead.
You're dead,

2314
01:46:16,120 --> 01:46:16,480
you know?

2315
01:46:17,370 --> 01:46:22,370
Yeah.
Just amazing that they figured this out 

2316
01:46:22,370 --> 01:46:23,550
so you have to do all this stuff to it 
and prepare it.

2317
01:46:23,551 --> 01:46:28,551
And the actual buckets of liquid.
They were saying Rinella was talking 

2318
01:46:28,551 --> 01:46:30,240
about how they just leave them around 
the camp and he was like,

2319
01:46:30,300 --> 01:46:31,930
what if,
what if a kid drinks that?

2320
01:46:32,330 --> 01:46:36,140
They don't.
So she's cooking it up.

2321
01:46:36,230 --> 01:46:39,560
Just got some way to special anyway.
Anyway,

2322
01:46:40,580 --> 01:46:45,580
but yeah,
I mean how long did it take them to 

2323
01:46:45,580 --> 01:46:45,580
figure out that if they can grind that 
plan up,

2324
01:46:45,580 --> 01:46:45,660
throw it in the water official Pamela

2325
01:46:46,050 --> 01:46:48,510
died eating their cells because it looks
like a fruit.

2326
01:46:48,620 --> 01:46:53,620
Yeah.
And there's so many in the Australian 

2327
01:46:53,620 --> 01:46:55,200
outback that look and smell and even 
taste good.

2328
01:46:55,380 --> 01:46:56,550
But man,
I'll kill you.

2329
01:46:56,650 --> 01:47:00,150
Baseball crazy when you think about the 
trial and error involved in figuring out

2330
01:47:00,151 --> 01:47:02,030
what you can and can't eat.
Mother,

2331
01:47:02,140 --> 01:47:04,260
motherfucker.
Now we've got all these books.

2332
01:47:04,280 --> 01:47:09,280
Least that takes the,
takes the mystery out of stuff like 

2333
01:47:09,280 --> 01:47:09,280
that.
But even then people screw it up.

2334
01:47:09,280 --> 01:47:10,740
Oh,
official time with mushrooms.

2335
01:47:10,920 --> 01:47:14,220
I nearly did it the other day.
There's one that it's um,

2336
01:47:14,610 --> 01:47:19,530
it's sort of tastes similar to an apple,
but a little bit like on the sour side,

2337
01:47:19,531 --> 01:47:22,590
if it was an unripe apple,
it's completely edible.

2338
01:47:23,310 --> 01:47:25,260
There's another one that looks nearly 
exactly the same,

2339
01:47:25,261 --> 01:47:27,780
but it drops the same pink flare at the 
bottom of it.

2340
01:47:27,781 --> 01:47:32,781
It's got this little spike that comes 
off it and so I'd been walking around 

2341
01:47:32,781 --> 01:47:35,310
eating these other ones because I didn't
have hardly any food and then I'm like,

2342
01:47:35,311 --> 01:47:40,311
oh,
there's a freaking whole heap of me and 

2343
01:47:40,311 --> 01:47:41,991
I grabbed,
grabbed them and just put them in the 

2344
01:47:41,991 --> 01:47:41,991
backpack,
got to this waterhole,

2345
01:47:41,991 --> 01:47:46,040
crack that open and just force shit is 
at the same time and then I smelled it 

2346
01:47:46,040 --> 01:47:46,040
and straight away.

2347
01:47:46,040 --> 01:47:50,570
It's not the same time.
It didn't have the same seeds or 

2348
01:47:50,570 --> 01:47:52,791
anything,
but how quick of a mistake to make and 

2349
01:47:52,791 --> 01:47:55,491
that one,
that second one that I grabbed his 

2350
01:47:55,491 --> 01:47:55,491
really frigging poisonous too.
So it's like,

2351
01:47:55,530 --> 01:48:00,530
oh yeah,
I need to carry a Bush Tucker book with 

2352
01:48:00,530 --> 01:48:02,841
me,
but at least those books out there now 

2353
01:48:02,841 --> 01:48:02,841
food things.
Yeah,

2354
01:48:02,841 --> 01:48:05,240
I've seen those ads around.
Yeah,

2355
01:48:05,250 --> 01:48:10,250
they use them for Sushi apparently.
Like the really a skillful Sushi chefs.

2356
01:48:10,770 --> 01:48:15,090
They slice through this thing and filet 
it put what the fuck.

2357
01:48:15,450 --> 01:48:18,090
The smallest mistake in preparation 
could be fatal,

2358
01:48:18,091 --> 01:48:23,091
but Tokyo city's government is planning 
to ease restrictions that allow only 

2359
01:48:23,091 --> 01:48:25,050
highly trained and licensed chef to 
serve the dish.

2360
01:48:25,680 --> 01:48:30,680
Fuck all that.
We'll just have a fucking eighth and 

2361
01:48:30,680 --> 01:48:30,930
normal fish cross too many crazy 
assholes.

2362
01:48:31,290 --> 01:48:36,290
But I think it's for people,
they like the thrill of knowing that 

2363
01:48:36,290 --> 01:48:36,290
they're reading something that could 
kill,

2364
01:48:36,290 --> 01:48:38,520
you know,
if prepared incorrectly.

2365
01:48:38,550 --> 01:48:40,460
He sounds like a fucking nail company.
Montana.

2366
01:48:43,800 --> 01:48:47,100
So how good that elk taste though.
Knowing what all the way through it.

2367
01:48:47,190 --> 01:48:52,190
Well,
because all the stuff and by the end 

2368
01:48:52,190 --> 01:48:52,190
like you can,
you can only have limited food with you.

2369
01:48:52,190 --> 01:48:54,990
And then even though I come out of the 
wall,

2370
01:48:55,080 --> 01:48:57,030
you know,
for like I come into town and bought the

2371
01:48:57,031 --> 01:48:59,160
bullets,
I didn't go to a store and be like,

2372
01:48:59,161 --> 01:49:01,290
I'm going to load up on a heap of other 
food and shit.

2373
01:49:01,430 --> 01:49:03,960
Got For me.
That was going to wreck the trip,

2374
01:49:03,961 --> 01:49:05,460
you know?
So I just go into town,

2375
01:49:05,670 --> 01:49:06,770
grab the bull bullets.
Yeah,

2376
01:49:06,810 --> 01:49:11,810
fucking wood.
It was a challenge to live off the land 

2377
01:49:11,810 --> 01:49:11,810
I did.
Yeah.

2378
01:49:11,810 --> 01:49:11,820
I wanted to live off the land.
I must have brought some food with you,

2379
01:49:11,821 --> 01:49:12,810
right?
Yeah.

2380
01:49:12,860 --> 01:49:17,860
Like,
so the first probably the first 11 

2381
01:49:17,860 --> 01:49:17,860
daylight.
Pretty good.

2382
01:49:17,860 --> 01:49:20,430
What did you bring with you?
Your meals?

2383
01:49:20,430 --> 01:49:22,170
You know,
little energy bars,

2384
01:49:22,171 --> 01:49:24,360
just because everything's got to be 
light,

2385
01:49:24,450 --> 01:49:29,450
you know,
so most everything was dehydrated or 

2386
01:49:29,450 --> 01:49:30,450
just like a light type of food is 
simple.

2387
01:49:30,860 --> 01:49:34,770
Simple as it is.
And then heaps of chocolate bars.

2388
01:49:34,790 --> 01:49:35,880
Actually,
they're not that light,

2389
01:49:35,881 --> 01:49:38,220
but fuck,
you need them when you're out there,

2390
01:49:38,221 --> 01:49:40,500
you need to pack that energy back on and
keep going.

2391
01:49:40,790 --> 01:49:44,670
So he hates the chocolate bars.
And then specific ones.

2392
01:49:44,671 --> 01:49:49,360
Do you use or just anyone you can get?
Just I can get just regular chocolate,

2393
01:49:49,600 --> 01:49:51,270
snickers bars.
That shit locked up,

2394
01:49:51,280 --> 01:49:51,850
right?
Yeah.

2395
01:49:51,970 --> 01:49:52,640
Calories.
Yeah.

2396
01:49:52,650 --> 01:49:54,810
Just calories.
Half the chocolate bars in America.

2397
01:49:54,830 --> 01:49:57,460
I don't even know what they are.
And then I opened them up and I'm like,

2398
01:49:57,461 --> 01:49:58,390
ah,
that shit,

2399
01:49:58,420 --> 01:50:02,410
you know,
because I did it so deep.

2400
01:50:02,530 --> 01:50:04,720
Different back in Australia,
but we do have sneakers,

2401
01:50:05,170 --> 01:50:06,670
but like we've got a Mars bar.

2402
01:50:06,700 --> 01:50:09,100
You don't have a Mars bar here.
It's called a Milky Way.

2403
01:50:09,130 --> 01:50:10,210
No,
we have Mars idea,

2404
01:50:10,470 --> 01:50:12,530
I couldn't find them anywhere and then 
be favorite it.

2405
01:50:12,670 --> 01:50:13,760
Oh,
they have mars bars here.

2406
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:17,230
I must have went to the wrong store was 
fucking dirty,

2407
01:50:17,410 --> 01:50:20,260
but I bought the milky ways which are 
different back in Australia as well.

2408
01:50:20,261 --> 01:50:22,060
And they are more similar to a Mars bar.
So.

2409
01:50:22,540 --> 01:50:24,550
But yeah,
so the first 11 days I pretty well,

2410
01:50:24,551 --> 01:50:26,320
but I'd still,
if I could spare food,

2411
01:50:26,321 --> 01:50:28,280
like if I could shoot a grouse.
Oh elite,

2412
01:50:28,300 --> 01:50:31,090
that if I come across barriers I'd eat 
those.

2413
01:50:31,460 --> 01:50:36,460
M and I sort of had contact with um,
April Voki who's like really into the 

2414
01:50:37,481 --> 01:50:40,920
outdoors and fly fishing and stuff.
She knows a lot of Australia.

2415
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:42,740
I did,
yeah.

2416
01:50:42,741 --> 01:50:43,540
Yeah.
And she's,

2417
01:50:43,750 --> 01:50:48,130
she's hunted with us a few times and her
get along like a house on fire.

2418
01:50:48,131 --> 01:50:51,000
So it works out good so far.
Good House.

2419
01:50:51,040 --> 01:50:54,550
You don't have that same eva get along 
like a house on fire.

2420
01:50:54,551 --> 01:50:59,320
That seems like a terrible way to get 
along with your fucking furious.

2421
01:51:02,050 --> 01:51:05,950
That's a few of those weird ones and I'm
like,

2422
01:51:05,951 --> 01:51:08,470
how'd they even come up with that one 
right there?

2423
01:51:09,440 --> 01:51:10,600
You know,
like jump the gun.

2424
01:51:10,601 --> 01:51:12,640
Did they actually jump the gun?
Yeah.

2425
01:51:12,641 --> 01:51:14,770
Well that's jumping.
The starting block already sent.

2426
01:51:14,830 --> 01:51:16,900
Bang.
Jumped the noise.

2427
01:51:17,770 --> 01:51:18,580
No,
jumped the gun.

2428
01:51:18,581 --> 01:51:23,581
Makes Sense.
It makes more sense to get along like a 

2429
01:51:23,581 --> 01:51:26,191
house on fire unless you have the fire 
because you're fucking burning up your 

2430
01:51:26,191 --> 01:51:28,440
gun blazing so you could look at it like
that as well.

2431
01:51:28,460 --> 01:51:29,700
See where you're going with that.
Yeah.

2432
01:51:30,010 --> 01:51:33,970
Um,
so April was sort of my go to person.

2433
01:51:33,971 --> 01:51:36,250
Like if,
if I had reception,

2434
01:51:36,520 --> 01:51:38,500
I'd take a photo and be like,
can I make this?

2435
01:51:40,110 --> 01:51:42,400
The worst thing is because she,
sometimes she be busy.

2436
01:51:42,401 --> 01:51:44,980
I'd be collecting heaps of them.
Like I'd need that and she'd be like,

2437
01:51:44,981 --> 01:51:46,690
definitely not.
And I'll be like fuck,

2438
01:51:48,040 --> 01:51:52,230
but I'm most things just from taste and 
a few things already knew.

2439
01:51:52,240 --> 01:51:57,240
But there'd be some areas,
especially up high where those beers 

2440
01:51:57,240 --> 01:52:00,531
were,
where I was seeing that grizzly in 

2441
01:52:00,531 --> 01:52:01,801
Colorado.
There was barry's everywhere and that's 

2442
01:52:01,801 --> 01:52:01,801
obviously one of the bays where they,
oh,

2443
01:52:01,801 --> 01:52:02,460
okay.
You ate those berries.

2444
01:52:02,690 --> 01:52:06,820
Just like frigging raspberries,
blueberries.

2445
01:52:07,310 --> 01:52:11,170
There's those rows,
nips.

2446
01:52:11,650 --> 01:52:13,310
Do you know those?
They look,

2447
01:52:13,400 --> 01:52:15,190
they don't look edible and they're 
pretty hard,

2448
01:52:15,191 --> 01:52:17,090
but they're really good for you,
but you hate too many of them.

2449
01:52:17,091 --> 01:52:19,270
They'll make you feel itchy.
Itchy.

2450
01:52:19,300 --> 01:52:21,190
Yeah.
Which I never felt itchy,

2451
01:52:21,191 --> 01:52:23,580
but I didn't want to get to that point.
Like walking around hunting.

2452
01:52:23,890 --> 01:52:25,040
Really?
They make you itchy.

2453
01:52:25,340 --> 01:52:27,640
When we instituted crack,
what was the word?

2454
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,120
Was the word that you used?
Bush something.

2455
01:52:31,450 --> 01:52:32,740
Bushtukah.
Bush Tucker.

2456
01:52:32,741 --> 01:52:33,910
What does that mean?
Taco?

2457
01:52:34,720 --> 01:52:36,660
You Americans need that?
Come up with a scratch.

2458
01:52:40,230 --> 01:52:44,290
You fucking mall.
Can't say fucking as ing.

2459
01:52:44,320 --> 01:52:46,130
Ing.
It's got to be a n

2460
01:52:46,130 --> 01:52:49,010
on the end of the fucking.
You'd say Ian,

2461
01:52:49,011 --> 01:52:51,590
where you would say I am.
And then put an apostrophe.

2462
01:52:51,610 --> 01:52:52,150
Yeah,
right.

2463
01:52:52,190 --> 01:52:57,190
Fucking fucking fucking mall there.
You gotta say I was trying to fit right 

2464
01:52:59,361 --> 01:53:00,230
in.
Perfect.

2465
01:53:00,260 --> 01:53:02,750
You'd get to get used to driving on the 
wrong side of the road.

2466
01:53:02,810 --> 01:53:03,970
No,
it's the right side.

2467
01:53:03,971 --> 01:53:07,460
I'm pretty sure.
But yeah,

2468
01:53:07,461 --> 01:53:10,160
so April was my go to.
What does that mean though?

2469
01:53:10,280 --> 01:53:10,960
Bush?
Tacos.

2470
01:53:10,970 --> 01:53:13,580
Food.
So food.

2471
01:53:13,820 --> 01:53:17,420
Bush Tucker talk his food truck.
Taco Tucker.

2472
01:53:17,750 --> 01:53:18,420
Tucker.
Yeah.

2473
01:53:18,460 --> 01:53:19,730
Talk.
Let's go get some tucker.

2474
01:53:19,760 --> 01:53:20,810
Yeah,
let's go and get some tacos.

2475
01:53:20,940 --> 01:53:25,940
Go get some top.
Have you ever heard that young Jeremy 

2476
01:53:25,940 --> 01:53:25,970
know that is,
this is normal.

2477
01:53:26,210 --> 01:53:30,200
It is very normal for who?
For dry heat.

2478
01:53:30,270 --> 01:53:32,510
And it's just like a dialect that you 
picked up with the outback.

2479
01:53:32,540 --> 01:53:34,510
No,
it's pretty fucking.

2480
01:53:35,360 --> 01:53:40,250
Thank God for Google show called Bush 
food is any food native to Australia and

2481
01:53:40,251 --> 01:53:44,660
use assessments by the original 
inhabitants to aboriginal Australians.

2482
01:53:44,810 --> 01:53:48,920
But it can also describe native for or 
Florida Flora or fauna.

2483
01:53:49,450 --> 01:53:51,260
Um,
so that was something.

2484
01:53:51,261 --> 01:53:54,080
Did you pick up from the indigenous 
people?

2485
01:53:54,110 --> 01:53:57,350
No,
I think I'll just rise like that.

2486
01:53:57,351 --> 01:54:02,351
You know,
so it's just a phrase grew up out in the

2487
01:54:02,360 --> 01:54:04,120
Bush Tucker,
the woods.

2488
01:54:04,330 --> 01:54:06,740
Mar Lou is what you call a kangaroo.
Yeah,

2489
01:54:06,741 --> 01:54:09,230
they're indigenous names Maher.
Lou,

2490
01:54:10,090 --> 01:54:11,280
Bard.
Dewar.

2491
01:54:11,281 --> 01:54:16,281
Uh,
what does that word that looks like it 

2492
01:54:17,421 --> 01:54:19,870
could be magpie geese.
And what is that one?

2493
01:54:20,590 --> 01:54:22,810
What does that,
how does that word Yali.

2494
01:54:23,630 --> 01:54:24,650
That's the name you.
Yay.

2495
01:54:24,860 --> 01:54:27,830
You Halle Berry.
And so do the people,

2496
01:54:27,860 --> 01:54:30,020
the indigenous people they date 
Kangaroos?

2497
01:54:30,110 --> 01:54:30,540
Yeah.
Yeah,

2498
01:54:30,541 --> 01:54:31,730
definitely.
Kangaroos,

2499
01:54:31,731 --> 01:54:33,710
wallabies.
Go in and see every kangaroo.

2500
01:54:33,740 --> 01:54:34,220
Yep.
Yep.

2501
01:54:35,090 --> 01:54:39,170
Um,
it's a very rich red meat,

2502
01:54:39,620 --> 01:54:41,570
like a really,
really rich red meat.

2503
01:54:41,600 --> 01:54:43,040
Good.
It's delicious.

2504
01:54:43,280 --> 01:54:45,980
And it's super lean,
like there's no fat content to it.

2505
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:48,380
And so do you buy it in a store?
You can.

2506
01:54:48,690 --> 01:54:50,930
What the fuck is that man?
That's bullshit.

2507
01:54:51,750 --> 01:54:52,840
Yeah,
that's right.

2508
01:54:53,270 --> 01:54:54,380
Yeah,
it's bullshit.

2509
01:54:54,381 --> 01:54:58,820
How is it bullshit guys?
Holding Brown sounded real.

2510
01:54:58,840 --> 01:54:59,630
Grub?
No,

2511
01:55:00,190 --> 01:55:02,210
it's like a wood grabber.
Witchetty grubs.

2512
01:55:02,211 --> 01:55:02,810
That good?
Aiden.

2513
01:55:03,650 --> 01:55:05,450
Oh.
So it's not really that big.

2514
01:55:05,590 --> 01:55:07,750
Wide.
Not that day.

2515
01:55:07,860 --> 01:55:10,850
Good grubs there.
That'd be witchetty grubs in good grubs.

2516
01:55:11,060 --> 01:55:12,920
Hold on.
So you see those?

2517
01:55:12,950 --> 01:55:13,420
Oh,
thems.

2518
01:55:13,430 --> 01:55:14,370
Good grubs.
Like you,

2519
01:55:14,430 --> 01:55:16,520
you'd go eat those.
Have you seen that video?

2520
01:55:18,560 --> 01:55:23,560
GRUBS went up.
They building the cabinet and I'm 

2521
01:55:23,560 --> 01:55:25,691
stripping the bark off it.
You will see all those grubs and I get 

2522
01:55:25,691 --> 01:55:25,691
them and cook them up and eat and eat 
them.

2523
01:55:27,020 --> 01:55:28,660
Just like paint up out at night,
but better.

2524
01:55:28,910 --> 01:55:30,180
They taste like peanut butter.
Yeah,

2525
01:55:30,200 --> 01:55:30,740
they do.
Yeah.

2526
01:55:30,830 --> 01:55:31,470
Really?
Yeah.

2527
01:55:31,490 --> 01:55:36,490
Probably even better than peanut butter.
What kind of peanut butter do you guys 

2528
01:55:36,490 --> 01:55:36,490
have in Australia?
They pretty good.

2529
01:55:36,490 --> 01:55:36,770
What does that?
Uh,

2530
01:55:36,771 --> 01:55:39,800
honey and honey and sugar ants.
Those are good.

2531
01:55:39,810 --> 01:55:41,000
Yep.
Yep.

2532
01:55:41,200 --> 01:55:46,200
And if you run out of like a,
if you're running out of tea or you 

2533
01:55:46,200 --> 01:55:50,391
know,
if you want a hot drink and you're out 

2534
01:55:50,391 --> 01:55:52,131
in the bush,
then you'd boil your water and then 

2535
01:55:52,131 --> 01:55:54,801
you'd get a heap of those in a leaf or 
on a leaf and you dip them in hot water 

2536
01:55:54,801 --> 01:55:56,670
and it makes like a nice tea.
But it's like sweetened already from the

2537
01:55:56,671 --> 01:55:59,010
ant.
I carry like a sugary taste on them.

2538
01:55:59,320 --> 01:56:04,320
Whoa.
So that little thing on there but is 

2539
01:56:04,320 --> 01:56:04,320
actually honey.
Yep.

2540
01:56:04,320 --> 01:56:06,990
They have a little bubble pack.
Well it's not really honey,

2541
01:56:06,991 --> 01:56:08,550
but it tastes like honey.
Really?

2542
01:56:08,551 --> 01:56:09,620
Yeah.
It looks like honey though.

2543
01:56:10,090 --> 01:56:15,090
Well what is it?
I'm pretty sure that anything that can 

2544
01:56:15,090 --> 01:56:15,090
produce honey,
that's crazy though.

2545
01:56:15,090 --> 01:56:16,500
The Bar,
that's their abdomen essentially,

2546
01:56:16,501 --> 01:56:16,980
right?
Yep.

2547
01:56:17,040 --> 01:56:21,750
So it looks like those black things 
settled as a separated.

2548
01:56:21,751 --> 01:56:22,180
Rather.
It's,

2549
01:56:22,240 --> 01:56:25,920
we'd look fucking some in photoshop.

2550
01:56:29,850 --> 01:56:31,830
So strange.
So they're tiny.

2551
01:56:31,831 --> 01:56:36,831
Strange because we don't eat it.
But imagine those things were grown on a

2552
01:56:36,931 --> 01:56:40,350
farm or and harvested for mass 
production.

2553
01:56:40,351 --> 01:56:43,770
No different than lame or I know what 
insects do.

2554
01:56:43,771 --> 01:56:45,570
We ate none,
which is frigging weird.

2555
01:56:45,571 --> 01:56:47,250
Why wouldn't we ate insects?
They food.

2556
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:52,530
People are starting to eat crickets and 
frogs and crickets being bugs.

2557
01:56:52,580 --> 01:56:54,820
Yeah.
A lot of people eat crickets these days.

2558
01:56:55,110 --> 01:56:56,610
Cricket,
protein powder.

2559
01:56:56,611 --> 01:56:59,610
It's very popular in America.
I think it will become,

2560
01:56:59,640 --> 01:57:02,680
I shouldn't say very like there's two 
people in all of America.

2561
01:57:02,710 --> 01:57:04,170
We'd becoming more properly.
They have,

2562
01:57:04,510 --> 01:57:07,200
um,
I think they have a nice cricket protein

2563
01:57:07,201 --> 01:57:12,201
bar that you can buy.
I haven't tried them but I send a 

2564
01:57:12,201 --> 01:57:13,160
Mexico,
but I've heard good things about them.

2565
01:57:13,530 --> 01:57:17,040
But I've been in Mexico and we went to 
this resort and when you check into your

2566
01:57:17,041 --> 01:57:22,041
hotel room,
they have like a little bowl of fried 

2567
01:57:22,041 --> 01:57:22,500
crickets really with chili powder and 
stuff.

2568
01:57:22,620 --> 01:57:25,260
Proudly strange.
What is that?

2569
01:57:25,440 --> 01:57:29,130
That the company and they sell crooked.
Oh,

2570
01:57:29,131 --> 01:57:32,250
xl.
What's his Goddamn pop up ads?

2571
01:57:32,580 --> 01:57:37,580
So Ekso Exoskeleton is curriculum.
I can understand why we wouldn't eat,

2572
01:57:38,850 --> 01:57:39,920
but we should have six.
Well,

2573
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:45,000
not only that,
but vegans should shitty them because 

2574
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:46,080
it's a great way to get be 12 and most 
people don't really care that much about

2575
01:57:46,081 --> 01:57:47,250
bugs.
It's like the,

2576
01:57:47,260 --> 01:57:47,650
the,
the,

2577
01:57:47,700 --> 01:57:52,700
the thing about Vegan seems to be a 
sentient animals and worrying about 

2578
01:57:52,891 --> 01:57:57,120
killing these.
I'm feeling life for them and if they,

2579
01:57:57,121 --> 01:57:59,880
if that's the way they feel,
they could be far healthier.

2580
01:58:00,120 --> 01:58:04,320
Eating mollusks mollusks are a big one.
They don't feel shit and they're fucking

2581
01:58:04,321 --> 01:58:09,321
stupid.
Like marks they say are dumber than 

2582
01:58:09,321 --> 01:58:12,081
plants are more primitive than plants.
The fact that they move is what freaks 

2583
01:58:12,081 --> 01:58:13,570
people out,
but what does a Vegan eat?

2584
01:58:13,571 --> 01:58:18,571
A Venus fly trap.
Would they eat that fucking moves to 

2585
01:58:18,571 --> 01:58:22,410
plant on the move.
They just take a left on the move and 

2586
01:58:22,410 --> 01:58:22,410
grow.
Exactly.

2587
01:58:22,410 --> 01:58:23,370
But crickets are really good source of 
protein,

2588
01:58:23,371 --> 01:58:27,540
so if someone wants to get animal or 
some sort of living proteins,

2589
01:58:27,760 --> 01:58:32,760
particularly like the nutrients and 
amino acids that you can get from that 

2590
01:58:32,760 --> 01:58:33,810
kind of protein,
just look into insects don't die.

2591
01:58:33,811 --> 01:58:38,811
You fuckers.
I'm going to stop my insect farming to 

2592
01:58:38,811 --> 01:58:38,811
it,
bitch.

2593
01:58:38,811 --> 01:58:38,811
Fuck.
This is.

2594
01:58:38,811 --> 01:58:38,811
Hey,
become a millionaire.

2595
01:58:39,530 --> 01:58:41,010
Seems like a tough.

2596
01:58:43,560 --> 01:58:45,100
I mean,
trust me.

2597
01:58:46,990 --> 01:58:48,970
Fuck.
Is it a tough sell with aiden?

2598
01:58:49,090 --> 01:58:50,590
Little lambs?
Well,

2599
01:58:50,591 --> 01:58:53,710
not only can't dry.
We're eating kangaroos.

2600
01:58:53,711 --> 01:58:58,240
And how about crabs and lobsters?
Which water?

2601
01:58:58,610 --> 01:58:59,760
Yeah,
crickets in particular.

2602
01:58:59,780 --> 01:59:00,880
Tastes good.
I'm telling you man,

2603
01:59:00,881 --> 01:59:02,680
I was grabbing on those crickets in 
Mexico.

2604
01:59:02,920 --> 01:59:06,010
They had like a nice chili powder on 
fried and like luxe,

2605
01:59:06,011 --> 01:59:09,940
other like crunchy kind of savory,
a little savory.

2606
01:59:09,970 --> 01:59:11,700
They were good.
They would like.

2607
01:59:11,710 --> 01:59:12,730
I would buy him.
Yeah,

2608
01:59:12,731 --> 01:59:14,020
that sounds good.
Days grabs that.

2609
01:59:14,021 --> 01:59:16,630
I'm talking about a delicious to draw 
the line.

2610
01:59:16,690 --> 01:59:18,280
Not Full.
Delicious.

2611
01:59:18,281 --> 01:59:23,281
It's just the full delicious.
That's the whole thing that the 

2612
01:59:23,281 --> 01:59:23,740
Australian say full fully or full.
Amazing.

2613
01:59:24,160 --> 01:59:26,410
Fully sick.
Fully sick.

2614
01:59:26,790 --> 01:59:31,790
Mad Come.
That is a good expression.

2615
01:59:33,020 --> 01:59:34,570
Cut.
Cameron.

2616
01:59:34,571 --> 01:59:36,910
I,
I actually,

2617
01:59:37,600 --> 01:59:42,430
some people might've been from me saying
that and they were like,

2618
01:59:42,431 --> 01:59:44,440
where can I get mad cunt?
Shit.

2619
01:59:44,510 --> 01:59:46,510
Your.
They had nice.

2620
01:59:46,511 --> 01:59:51,511
Can't because a can't or a bad con and 
the shirt that everyone wanted the.

2621
01:59:51,971 --> 01:59:54,260
I actually got one printed out but it 
didn't come and tell them I was gonna.

2622
01:59:54,280 --> 01:59:55,540
Wear it here.
Be Interested.

2623
01:59:55,541 --> 01:59:56,500
Just being nice.
Can.

2624
01:59:57,070 --> 01:59:59,890
It's as simple as that,
where you guys are very different use of

2625
01:59:59,891 --> 02:00:01,480
the word cunt.
Yeah.

2626
02:00:01,780 --> 02:00:04,960
Is like a good dude.
Well,

2627
02:00:05,930 --> 02:00:10,930
be mad if you say mad con.
That's awesome.

2628
02:00:11,411 --> 02:00:13,150
That's,
that's a bad motherfucker.

2629
02:00:13,180 --> 02:00:14,680
But if you're lucky,
you're a fucking cunt,

2630
02:00:14,770 --> 02:00:16,110
right?
No,

2631
02:00:16,870 --> 02:00:18,230
that's interesting.
Yeah.

2632
02:00:18,240 --> 02:00:20,880
Have much more range with the word 
content.

2633
02:00:21,020 --> 02:00:25,270
Do I love Australians?
Like even though you're going to say yes

2634
02:00:26,230 --> 02:00:27,640
or no,
they're always like,

2635
02:00:27,641 --> 02:00:32,641
Yay.
So they start with you and then they 

2636
02:00:32,641 --> 02:00:32,641
were like,
Nah.

2637
02:00:32,641 --> 02:00:32,641
Yeah,
yeah.

2638
02:00:32,790 --> 02:00:36,000
No,
that's a good one.

2639
02:00:36,200 --> 02:00:37,130
That's a good one.
Yeah.

2640
02:00:37,510 --> 02:00:41,110
Or if you're going to say no,
then go.

2641
02:00:41,110 --> 02:00:42,730
No,
you sake.

2642
02:00:42,750 --> 02:00:45,330
You shake your head,
but you say no,

2643
02:00:47,240 --> 02:00:49,750
it means I don't give a fuck.
You pick what you want.

2644
02:00:50,260 --> 02:00:52,070
So yes,
you're nodding yes.

2645
02:00:53,150 --> 02:00:54,430
Kim will be like,
you know,

2646
02:00:54,730 --> 02:00:56,810
should I this swimsuit?
You know,

2647
02:00:57,010 --> 02:00:58,110
and I'll be like,
no,

2648
02:01:01,120 --> 02:01:06,120
because whatever,
whatever the fuck I say,

2649
02:01:06,170 --> 02:01:09,010
doesn't matter.
She's going to get what she wants.

2650
02:01:09,440 --> 02:01:11,260
Yeah.
You know what I've developed.

2651
02:01:11,261 --> 02:01:14,530
I developed an amazing ability to not 
listen when someone's talking.

2652
02:01:15,910 --> 02:01:17,680
That's what I've been doing.
This whole show.

2653
02:01:17,710 --> 02:01:22,710
Oh man,
I don't mean I could hear they talk 

2654
02:01:25,091 --> 02:01:30,091
about stuff that I like,
especially with my wife gets together 

2655
02:01:30,091 --> 02:01:32,551
with her friends.
They can have a conversation that could 

2656
02:01:32,551 --> 02:01:34,741
be right there.
I don't hear a fucking thing came lobby 

2657
02:01:34,741 --> 02:01:34,910
in a field.
Just hearing truth.

2658
02:01:37,200 --> 02:01:38,830
You're antisocial.
I'm like,

2659
02:01:38,860 --> 02:01:39,920
no,
not antisocial.

2660
02:01:39,921 --> 02:01:41,840
I just don't have to talk about 
everything.

2661
02:01:41,850 --> 02:01:46,850
I'm quite happy.
Sitting there quietly thing think is a 

2662
02:01:46,850 --> 02:01:49,930
very big biological difference between 
the way women like to especially a guy 

2663
02:01:49,930 --> 02:01:53,870
like you who does so much hunting where 
it's very valuable to be quiet.

2664
02:01:53,900 --> 02:01:56,360
Yeah.
I've actually had some friends say to me

2665
02:01:56,450 --> 02:02:01,450
like that I'm very antisocial and it's 
like you're not interested in hanging 

2666
02:02:01,761 --> 02:02:05,300
out with first and stuff like that.
And friends hunt.

2667
02:02:05,680 --> 02:02:06,260
Yeah,
they do.

2668
02:02:06,261 --> 02:02:09,400
But I like hunting solo,
like I just,

2669
02:02:10,010 --> 02:02:11,450
but it's not like a choice that I'm 
like,

2670
02:02:11,451 --> 02:02:14,450
I'm not fucking taken humor.
I'm not inviting him or whatever,

2671
02:02:14,990 --> 02:02:18,200
but I'm just happy to do it alone.
So if I'm planning a trip,

2672
02:02:18,201 --> 02:02:23,201
I don't necessarily plan it around 
someone else's time or something like 

2673
02:02:23,201 --> 02:02:26,951
that.
So they think you're antisocial because 

2674
02:02:26,951 --> 02:02:26,951
I wouldn't do it.

2675
02:02:26,951 --> 02:02:26,951
Well the,
yeah,

2676
02:02:26,951 --> 02:02:28,190
and they and they're a little bit like,
um,

2677
02:02:28,850 --> 02:02:33,850
they also like,
how can you just go out there by 

2678
02:02:33,850 --> 02:02:35,771
yourself like that,
like don't you get bored or you don't 

2679
02:02:35,771 --> 02:02:35,771
miss talking to someone or whatever.
And then,

2680
02:02:36,040 --> 02:02:37,760
and it's taken me years to figure it 
out,

2681
02:02:37,761 --> 02:02:42,761
like why am I so comfortable being by 
myself or not saying a word in a crowd 

2682
02:02:42,761 --> 02:02:43,290
of people at a talk and,
or,

2683
02:02:43,670 --> 02:02:45,550
and like,
you know,

2684
02:02:45,560 --> 02:02:50,560
my past growing up.
But a lot of it's been from my past 

2685
02:02:50,560 --> 02:02:53,681
growing up and like I've nailed it.
It's like I grew up with people that 

2686
02:02:53,681 --> 02:02:56,090
were supposed to be loved.
Ones that didn't show love at all.

2687
02:02:56,480 --> 02:03:00,290
In fact they taught you the complete 
opposite instead of teaching trust,

2688
02:03:00,291 --> 02:03:03,500
like poor distrust because this is 
supposed to be a person that's close and

2689
02:03:03,501 --> 02:03:06,260
treat your world and they're fucking 
treating you like shit.

2690
02:03:06,710 --> 02:03:11,710
So you slowly start moving away from 
sort of mankind in a sense where we 

2691
02:03:13,450 --> 02:03:16,400
started association associating people 
with a negative feeling.

2692
02:03:16,430 --> 02:03:19,610
Exactly.
And so the way that I'd get treated,

2693
02:03:19,700 --> 02:03:24,700
you know,
growing up was I'd be better off by 

2694
02:03:24,700 --> 02:03:24,700
myself,
you know,

2695
02:03:24,700 --> 02:03:26,270
I'm better off safer,
Kim sort of that now.

2696
02:03:26,271 --> 02:03:28,850
But that's what I mean,
has she directed it?

2697
02:03:28,851 --> 02:03:29,780
But um,
yeah,

2698
02:03:29,820 --> 02:03:31,680
I grew up all those years knowing,
you know,

2699
02:03:31,760 --> 02:03:36,760
not to trust people and people are 
fucking actually dangerous and stuff 

2700
02:03:36,760 --> 02:03:40,151
like that.
So I'm happy being off by myself and 

2701
02:03:40,151 --> 02:03:40,460
doing my own thing.
And then like I said,

2702
02:03:40,461 --> 02:03:45,461
now it's different.
I've got my own family and I know the 

2703
02:03:45,461 --> 02:03:47,771
complete opposite.
I trust and love and everything like 

2704
02:03:47,771 --> 02:03:50,621
that.
But it's also the hunting thing for you 

2705
02:03:50,621 --> 02:03:52,661
that when you're hunting you're just 
locked in on the task at hand to a 

2706
02:03:53,181 --> 02:03:53,630
degree.

2707
02:03:53,630 --> 02:03:58,630
Definitely don't want someone with you 
that's going to mess it up or not 

2708
02:04:00,200 --> 02:04:05,200
because I'm not a self that,
that sort of sounds a little bit 

2709
02:04:05,200 --> 02:04:05,200
selfish.
I don't mean it that way.

2710
02:04:05,210 --> 02:04:10,210
I don't mean it that way.
What I mean is it like you're focused 

2711
02:04:10,210 --> 02:04:10,250
now definitely focused on need anybody 
else?

2712
02:04:10,251 --> 02:04:13,670
But when you're focused you don't,
you really don't need anybody else.

2713
02:04:13,671 --> 02:04:14,410
It's just the,
the,

2714
02:04:14,420 --> 02:04:17,030
the task,
just you against the elements.

2715
02:04:17,810 --> 02:04:19,350
Yeah,
I,

2716
02:04:19,810 --> 02:04:22,880
I,
I think it's that it's pushing myself.

2717
02:04:23,130 --> 02:04:25,220
It's,
I love the fucking wilderness.

2718
02:04:25,310 --> 02:04:27,080
Like it's just as simple as that.
And Joe,

2719
02:04:27,081 --> 02:04:32,081
like I always feel like,
like I love the society we live in and 

2720
02:04:32,081 --> 02:04:35,171
this whole system,
but it's not the system that I've 

2721
02:04:35,171 --> 02:04:37,980
designed for myself.
Like I'd love to go back 10,000

2722
02:04:37,981 --> 02:04:38,580
years,
dude.

2723
02:04:38,700 --> 02:04:41,100
Jesus and believe in them and have a 
shitty blow though.

2724
02:04:41,460 --> 02:04:43,150
Fuck.
Oh yeah.

2725
02:04:43,430 --> 02:04:48,430
Arrows would be indigenous to Australia 
which are running around with a spear 

2726
02:04:48,481 --> 02:04:49,380
and boomerang.
Dude,

2727
02:04:49,570 --> 02:04:51,390
you'd be happy with that.
Oh hell yeah.

2728
02:04:51,540 --> 02:04:54,000
I wouldn't be happy with that.
I'm not knowing what I know though.

2729
02:04:54,001 --> 02:04:56,550
So this is the thing with Kim's fucked 
it for me.

2730
02:04:57,030 --> 02:05:01,170
Like I wish he could just be a real 
bitch and nasty and not good looking and

2731
02:05:01,171 --> 02:05:02,040
then,
you know,

2732
02:05:02,041 --> 02:05:04,920
it'd be like I am going walkabout.
I coming back,

2733
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:08,850
funny expression going walk about that 
is a funny expression.

2734
02:05:08,970 --> 02:05:10,140
Walkabout.
Yeah.

2735
02:05:10,150 --> 02:05:14,970
Just because I would take him so far to 
get from wherever they were,

2736
02:05:15,020 --> 02:05:16,590
you know,
because I travel a lot.

2737
02:05:16,850 --> 02:05:18,240
Um,
there's actually,

2738
02:05:18,430 --> 02:05:23,430
there's,
I think there's some hard evidence now 

2739
02:05:23,430 --> 02:05:25,260
that indigenous Australians because 
there was symbols like right down on the

2740
02:05:25,261 --> 02:05:28,500
east coast of Australia,
the same exact symbols go all the way up

2741
02:05:28,501 --> 02:05:29,970
the coast to the northern territory.

2742
02:05:29,970 --> 02:05:34,050
This is a five day drive by the way that
the indigenous would walk that,

2743
02:05:34,460 --> 02:05:35,460
you know,
so,

2744
02:05:36,360 --> 02:05:39,840
so walk about like Kevin used to walk 
from community.

2745
02:05:39,980 --> 02:05:43,560
So that's built by the Australian 
government to housing indigenous people.

2746
02:05:43,860 --> 02:05:46,800
Then they also have a,
we call it on country,

2747
02:05:46,801 --> 02:05:51,801
but I'm like at our community Jesper,
he's mob on his land,

2748
02:05:52,021 --> 02:05:54,340
you know,
Kevin's a traditional owner just,

2749
02:05:54,341 --> 02:05:55,490
but he's Milan,
he's land.

2750
02:05:55,810 --> 02:06:00,810
They would walk that,
it would take them five days to walk it 

2751
02:06:00,810 --> 02:06:03,740
and then so if they went out on country 
for a while and haunted and stuff like 

2752
02:06:03,740 --> 02:06:03,740
that,
which side?

2753
02:06:03,740 --> 02:06:08,051
I spend another 20 or 30 days out there,
maybe longer than another five days 

2754
02:06:08,051 --> 02:06:11,811
walk.
You can see why they called it a 

2755
02:06:11,811 --> 02:06:11,811
walkabout.
That disappeared.

2756
02:06:11,811 --> 02:06:14,901
And that's how the science come up.
When you go away for a long time is 

2757
02:06:14,901 --> 02:06:17,110
you've gone and walk about because you 
literally walk that distance,

2758
02:06:17,111 --> 02:06:21,120
they'd be out on country for certain 
amount of period and then come back.

2759
02:06:21,600 --> 02:06:24,120
So that's why I've sort of adopted as 
well,

2760
02:06:24,121 --> 02:06:27,570
like when I go walkabout walkabout on 
Chemo,

2761
02:06:27,571 --> 02:06:28,020
fair bit.

2762
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:34,470
The idea of driving five days that they 
could walk it.

2763
02:06:34,800 --> 02:06:39,800
And now these are different.
I mean you were talking about all the 

2764
02:06:39,800 --> 02:06:40,140
different dialects and different tribes 
of people.

2765
02:06:40,500 --> 02:06:44,950
Now what the hell did they do with they 
encountered sometimes I'd have that.

2766
02:06:45,060 --> 02:06:47,360
They'd be war and stuff like that 
between truck,

2767
02:06:47,430 --> 02:06:52,430
between mobs.
They'd be war and things like that 

2768
02:06:52,430 --> 02:06:54,711
because that I think in most cases 
they'd try and avoid it and they'd have 

2769
02:06:54,711 --> 02:06:55,680
like their corridor that they walk 
through.

2770
02:06:55,681 --> 02:06:58,560
But uh,
they all had their own land.

2771
02:06:58,561 --> 02:07:03,561
What they sort of pretty much caught.
I can't say they all had their own lane 

2772
02:07:03,561 --> 02:07:04,380
because there's so many indigenous mobs 
that.

2773
02:07:05,240 --> 02:07:10,240
And there was so many differences 
between them that some of them would 

2774
02:07:10,240 --> 02:07:10,240
just pure nomadic,
you know?

2775
02:07:10,240 --> 02:07:12,090
And just just have written language.

2776
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:20,000
I don't know.
I think they've written language 

2777
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:23,360
freaking don't quote me on this was like
the dream time and the paintings and 

2778
02:07:23,360 --> 02:07:24,900
everything like that and everyone tells 
him a story.

2779
02:07:25,170 --> 02:07:30,170
What's getting lost is it's only the 
traditional elders that know those 

2780
02:07:30,170 --> 02:07:30,750
stories and they got to pass it on to 
the next generation.

2781
02:07:31,050 --> 02:07:33,270
So this is their story.
This is their paintings,

2782
02:07:33,271 --> 02:07:38,271
this is how the story goes when it gets 
lost is when the mall essentially dies 

2783
02:07:39,821 --> 02:07:40,910
out,
you know,

2784
02:07:41,180 --> 02:07:43,930
or it's not passed on down through the 
generations.

2785
02:07:44,350 --> 02:07:49,350
That's just so crazy that there's this 
enormous population of people and their 

2786
02:07:49,350 --> 02:07:49,990
stories not being told.
Yeah,

2787
02:07:50,020 --> 02:07:55,020
it seems sad when I think about it.
In one sense it seems really sad,

2788
02:07:55,480 --> 02:08:00,480
but in another sense it shouldn't matter
to anyone else because it's just those 

2789
02:08:00,480 --> 02:08:02,620
people's language and their stories.
So if they die,

2790
02:08:02,621 --> 02:08:03,940
it's gone with them anyway.

2791
02:08:04,210 --> 02:08:05,440
Yeah.
But I mean it's still,

2792
02:08:05,680 --> 02:08:09,400
just for the historical record,
I think it'd be great for human,

2793
02:08:09,650 --> 02:08:14,650
just a human life.
Definitely to understand that this is a 

2794
02:08:14,650 --> 02:08:14,650
really,
uh,

2795
02:08:14,650 --> 02:08:17,110
a very little understood group of human 
beings.

2796
02:08:17,140 --> 02:08:19,900
Don't you height that the mystery is 
getting taken out of everything though,

2797
02:08:21,610 --> 02:08:23,980
like it's good to have all that 
information,

2798
02:08:23,981 --> 02:08:28,981
like go on Google and find out frigging 
the age of the last ice age or something

2799
02:08:29,411 --> 02:08:34,411
like that and which is awesome,
but it also cancels out all the mystery.

2800
02:08:34,481 --> 02:08:39,481
Like we know that there's no other sort 
of monster crocodile in the waters 

2801
02:08:39,481 --> 02:08:43,610
anymore because the whole world's like 
right at our fingertips instead of being

2802
02:08:43,611 --> 02:08:45,630
a hoe out,
have that mystery in their mind.

2803
02:08:45,631 --> 02:08:45,980
Like,
oh,

2804
02:08:45,981 --> 02:08:48,160
I wonder what's out the back there.
You know?

2805
02:08:48,161 --> 02:08:51,430
And that's why I feel like there's no 
more last frontiers.

2806
02:08:51,431 --> 02:08:56,431
I love Colon Arnhem Land,
the last frontier in places like 

2807
02:08:56,431 --> 02:08:57,190
Northwest Territories,
the last frontier because there's hardly

2808
02:08:57,191 --> 02:09:02,191
any humans out there,
but the truth is it's all been 

2809
02:09:02,191 --> 02:09:02,191
discovered.

2810
02:09:02,191 --> 02:09:06,240
It's all pretty much been documented 
pipe that you got some like real 

2811
02:09:06,240 --> 02:09:08,290
wanderlust dude,
you got side type shit.

2812
02:09:09,220 --> 02:09:11,470
That's why I'm like,
I wish I could go back in.

2813
02:09:11,590 --> 02:09:15,490
Like there's no way to discover anymore.
Like Stuart Macdonald,

2814
02:09:15,491 --> 02:09:20,491
who's he?
He was an alcoholic buddy who's a a is 

2815
02:09:20,491 --> 02:09:24,240
actually a real famous early explorer 
that come into Australia and Australia 

2816
02:09:24,371 --> 02:09:26,650
was convinced all the people of 
Adelaide,

2817
02:09:27,100 --> 02:09:28,990
we're convinced that's where the first 
settlements were,

2818
02:09:28,991 --> 02:09:33,991
that there was an inland ocean in 
Australia because there's all these 

2819
02:09:33,991 --> 02:09:38,491
rivers running out from the center of 
Australia and it couldn't be the 

2820
02:09:38,491 --> 02:09:39,040
opposite as you know,
it's whole fucking desert,

2821
02:09:39,280 --> 02:09:44,280
but they walk in and out of there so 
many times and so many men died and a 

2822
02:09:44,280 --> 02:09:49,080
Mcdonald's.
Stuart himself nearly died a couple of 

2823
02:09:49,080 --> 02:09:50,590
times from starvation and no water 
because now walking into the desert.

2824
02:09:50,980 --> 02:09:55,980
In the end he was successful and he 
ended up walking all the way through to 

2825
02:09:56,351 --> 02:09:57,220
the top of Australia.

2826
02:09:57,220 --> 02:10:02,220
Dude,
there's no fucking water until you get 

2827
02:10:02,220 --> 02:10:03,020
to the top of Australia.
How did he get through it,

2828
02:10:03,180 --> 02:10:08,180
but imagine being back then when there 
was all that mystery there was that you 

2829
02:10:08,180 --> 02:10:12,751
were thinking that there was an inland 
ocean in Australia because of these 

2830
02:10:12,751 --> 02:10:13,500
rivers running out,
but those rivers are ancient rivers.

2831
02:10:13,520 --> 02:10:18,520
They're millions of years old and for so
many hundreds of thousand years I 

2832
02:10:18,520 --> 02:10:20,630
haven't even ran on top of the surface.
They run onto the sand,

2833
02:10:20,631 --> 02:10:24,490
didn't the rocks.
I was rivers so crazy to think.

2834
02:10:24,610 --> 02:10:29,020
But at some of the stories is um,
he's got an awesome book.

2835
02:10:29,730 --> 02:10:34,730
Well,
he doesn't have an awesome book because 

2836
02:10:34,730 --> 02:10:34,730
he's long gone,
but it's an awesome book.

2837
02:10:34,730 --> 02:10:38,180
Erin called Mr Stewart track and um,
there's one point [inaudible] 

2838
02:10:38,330 --> 02:10:43,330
indigenous,
like they had never encountered the 

2839
02:10:43,330 --> 02:10:45,131
indigenous and things like that as well.
They walk into the center of Australia 

2840
02:10:45,131 --> 02:10:45,440
where it was highly populated with 
indigenous people.

2841
02:10:45,470 --> 02:10:50,470
No white people had ever been in there,
no settlers before that were literally 

2842
02:10:50,470 --> 02:10:52,040
cutting the first tracks and drawing the
maps dude.

2843
02:10:52,700 --> 02:10:57,640
And like they walk in the one spot and 
like they,

2844
02:10:57,670 --> 02:10:59,780
they had been three days or something 
without water.

2845
02:10:59,781 --> 02:11:03,170
Like they are on the brink of death and 
it's,

2846
02:11:03,360 --> 02:11:06,230
I think it's like a miracle.
There's like a little well out there,

2847
02:11:06,231 --> 02:11:11,231
like a clay built well out in the middle
of nowhere and it's got this crystal 

2848
02:11:11,231 --> 02:11:14,591
clear water in it.
They keep the cattle and horses at bike 

2849
02:11:14,591 --> 02:11:17,870
because Katelyn horses would smell the 
water and just go in there and trash it 

2850
02:11:17,870 --> 02:11:21,221
before the man could get there so they 
keep the cattle and horses that by that 

2851
02:11:21,221 --> 02:11:23,460
going if they on canteens and fill them 
up and drink and you know,

2852
02:11:23,461 --> 02:11:25,820
all the manager just getting as much 
water as I can.

2853
02:11:26,330 --> 02:11:31,330
Then they've let the horses and cattle 
go so they can have a drink now.

2854
02:11:31,790 --> 02:11:34,580
The horses and cattle come in there and 
they trampled his whole.

2855
02:11:34,581 --> 02:11:39,581
Well,
like it ends up going back to dust 

2856
02:11:39,581 --> 02:11:39,581
because I gave it all in.
They drink as much water as I can,

2857
02:11:39,581 --> 02:11:43,160
like have it all in and uh,
the water pretty much dissipates.

2858
02:11:43,850 --> 02:11:48,850
Then they ride out for three or four 
days and they can't find water and 

2859
02:11:48,921 --> 02:11:50,690
they've run out of the water that they 
collected there.

2860
02:11:51,050 --> 02:11:54,620
They turned back to there and it might 
have even been longer.

2861
02:11:54,621 --> 02:11:59,621
It might have been a couple of weeks.
I might have been on the way back off 

2862
02:11:59,621 --> 02:12:02,161
the not being able to go any further.
And I come back there and there's all 

2863
02:12:02,161 --> 02:12:06,521
these aborigines said dead because the 
aborigines were the ones that would put 

2864
02:12:06,521 --> 02:12:09,080
the willingness.
They walked days and days and they would

2865
02:12:09,081 --> 02:12:13,670
just have a water source at the last 
point that just go.

2866
02:12:13,670 --> 02:12:15,830
They knew water was there.
They drink that,

2867
02:12:15,900 --> 02:12:17,510
be able to make it the next three or 
four days.

2868
02:12:17,530 --> 02:12:19,430
The next bit of water.
They get there.

2869
02:12:19,820 --> 02:12:22,250
It's fully caved in.
They can't get to the water.

2870
02:12:22,251 --> 02:12:25,500
There's a whole mob of indigenous people
dead there.

2871
02:12:25,501 --> 02:12:30,501
They.
They knew they couldn't go on any 

2872
02:12:30,501 --> 02:12:30,501
further or at least all the ones that 
were dead.

2873
02:12:30,501 --> 02:12:33,860
They knew they couldn't go on any 
further and a dog are there and there 

2874
02:12:33,860 --> 02:12:35,030
was no water.
There was no world there anymore.

2875
02:12:35,060 --> 02:12:40,060
Like the catalog just trampled it.
And one thing like as if that's not 

2876
02:12:40,060 --> 02:12:43,991
crazy enough,
but one thing that I always think about 

2877
02:12:43,991 --> 02:12:46,660
is I'm imagining the indigenous people 
coming across these who've prints like 

2878
02:12:46,941 --> 02:12:48,320
that because there's nothing in 
Australia.

2879
02:12:48,640 --> 02:12:53,640
You've got to think they're the biggest 
animals running around in Australia 

2880
02:12:53,640 --> 02:12:53,640
would like Kangaroos,
dude,

2881
02:12:53,640 --> 02:12:55,160
I'd have these little toad legs.

2882
02:12:55,220 --> 02:13:00,220
And then they come across these massive 
prints for the first time that had just 

2883
02:13:00,220 --> 02:13:01,790
devastated their,
the last drink and hall before they move

2884
02:13:01,791 --> 02:13:04,700
onto the next place.
Crazy stories in this book.

2885
02:13:04,850 --> 02:13:08,090
So there's no way to dig down deeper to 
restart the.

2886
02:13:08,091 --> 02:13:08,840
Well,
I guess.

2887
02:13:08,841 --> 02:13:10,450
No,
I guess at that point yet.

2888
02:13:10,451 --> 02:13:15,451
So you're already so dehydrated,
but you're walking to a point that you 

2889
02:13:15,451 --> 02:13:19,331
think that there's water because you 
build a well and then there's not 

2890
02:13:19,331 --> 02:13:19,530
anymore.
Not that idea.

2891
02:13:19,580 --> 02:13:22,310
Very much debt they would've given up 
because they are hottie people.

2892
02:13:22,311 --> 02:13:27,311
But whatever they tried to do obviously 
wasn't enough fucking white people know.

2893
02:13:28,580 --> 02:13:31,980
Isn't that horrible story why people 
ruin everything?

2894
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:36,060
I hate to say we've done a lot of good 
thought wrong of white people.

2895
02:13:36,290 --> 02:13:37,190
Yeah.
But,

2896
02:13:37,580 --> 02:13:41,870
but so I see the mystery behind fucking 
just walking into the center,

2897
02:13:42,190 --> 02:13:44,600
even though it's a horrible mystery to 
go through,

2898
02:13:44,940 --> 02:13:45,770
you know?
That's what I mean.

2899
02:13:45,771 --> 02:13:50,771
At least a haven has done at the Di in,
in the middle of Australia thinking I'm 

2900
02:13:50,771 --> 02:13:54,401
going to go when they fish and there's 
an inland ocean in somewhere and they 

2901
02:13:54,401 --> 02:13:54,401
never come across it.
You're at the middle of the desert,

2902
02:13:54,401 --> 02:13:57,880
but at the same time it takes away from 
all the mystery in life at it

2903
02:13:58,150 --> 02:14:01,750
things way different than me because you
have that wanderlust.

2904
02:14:01,860 --> 02:14:02,620
Got You.
Have that.

2905
02:14:02,621 --> 02:14:05,300
I want to go out and find the hidden 
things.

2906
02:14:05,330 --> 02:14:06,620
I don't have any of that shit.
Yeah.

2907
02:14:06,880 --> 02:14:07,720
I'm like,
okay,

2908
02:14:07,750 --> 02:14:09,790
where's the water?
No,

2909
02:14:09,791 --> 02:14:09,980
no,
no,

2910
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:11,020
no.
Show me on a map.

2911
02:14:11,080 --> 02:14:12,010
Where's the water?
Okay.

2912
02:14:12,290 --> 02:14:12,920
Where?
What?

2913
02:14:12,960 --> 02:14:15,310
What kind of equipment do we need?
What are we doing?

2914
02:14:15,311 --> 02:14:20,311
Do we have backup gun?
We get charged like you and I are very 

2915
02:14:21,521 --> 02:14:24,280
different in that regard.
I have no desire to go to uncharted

2916
02:14:24,540 --> 02:14:26,480
towards Reiki.
It's not.

2917
02:14:26,490 --> 02:14:31,490
The risk that's appealing was just a 
wanderlust.

2918
02:14:32,550 --> 02:14:36,120
It must be.
Just put your finger on that last.

2919
02:14:36,980 --> 02:14:41,070
That cave system that you put a picture 
up of before that I took photos of a lot

2920
02:14:41,071 --> 02:14:45,060
of people have asked like where is that?
But for me personally,

2921
02:14:45,061 --> 02:14:50,061
I'd like to keep that undocumented 
because it seems once a place is known 

2922
02:14:50,061 --> 02:14:50,970
as no different than a good fishing or 
hunting spot,

2923
02:14:51,160 --> 02:14:54,570
it gets fucking ruined.
And that cave system,

2924
02:14:54,600 --> 02:14:57,520
for starters,
it's not up to me because you know,

2925
02:14:57,540 --> 02:15:01,800
that'd be up to the traditional owners 
to want to put that out there for people

2926
02:15:01,801 --> 02:15:03,120
to go and look at it.
It's not up to me,

2927
02:15:03,121 --> 02:15:06,120
so I can't share that information.
But for me personally,

2928
02:15:06,121 --> 02:15:11,121
I don't want that to be documented 
because I know as soon as it's 

2929
02:15:11,121 --> 02:15:11,121
documented,
robish will shop there.

2930
02:15:11,121 --> 02:15:16,040
Some decades will shop there and spray 
paint or scribble on rule one or some 

2931
02:15:16,040 --> 02:15:20,961
shit like that.
Some places are better off on 

2932
02:15:20,961 --> 02:15:21,560
undocumented.

2933
02:15:21,580 --> 02:15:26,580
Well we,
the human race has got to evolve past 

2934
02:15:26,580 --> 02:15:28,240
that and that's a big order.
Obviously that's a very tall order.

2935
02:15:28,241 --> 02:15:29,700
But God,
we've got to evolve past

2936
02:15:29,730 --> 02:15:34,730
set a fucking white dude.
There's good people and bad people for 

2937
02:15:34,730 --> 02:15:34,730
the donut man.

2938
02:15:34,730 --> 02:15:36,790
Right?
But I think there's more good people now

2939
02:15:36,791 --> 02:15:41,791
than ever before.
Definitely more informed people now 

2940
02:15:41,791 --> 02:15:42,820
where before we just got to keep 
progressing along the same lines.

2941
02:15:42,821 --> 02:15:44,950
And I think that that progress is 
accelerating.

2942
02:15:45,180 --> 02:15:50,180
And I would just hope that more people 
in the future would have more 

2943
02:15:50,180 --> 02:15:53,341
appreciation for what that is,
is just like this incredible historical 

2944
02:15:53,341 --> 02:15:57,481
resource.
Are you seeing these mean we're talking 

2945
02:15:57,481 --> 02:15:59,821
about 65,000
years of people in this area and who 

2946
02:15:59,821 --> 02:16:00,790
knows how old those paintings.
It could be thousands of years old,

2947
02:16:00,791 --> 02:16:01,160
right?
I mean,

2948
02:16:01,320 --> 02:16:03,420
has anybody done leg or carbon dating on
them?

2949
02:16:03,690 --> 02:16:08,690
I'm sure there has been a bunch of.
They find those in Texas sometimes from 

2950
02:16:09,491 --> 02:16:13,390
native Americans to find them in caves.
Just find a cave system.

2951
02:16:13,391 --> 02:16:15,010
And then you just encountered these 
pictures.

2952
02:16:15,270 --> 02:16:17,850
I was hunting in New Mexico.
Uh,

2953
02:16:18,220 --> 02:16:19,430
we,
we saw,

2954
02:16:19,431 --> 02:16:23,390
I tagged out and then like I didn't want
the hunt and the hunt was done.

2955
02:16:23,391 --> 02:16:24,740
Sorry,
I didn't have any tags lift.

2956
02:16:25,010 --> 02:16:27,380
I didn't want the experience to end,
you know,

2957
02:16:27,440 --> 02:16:29,650
that's why I say it's never ever been,
you know,

2958
02:16:29,651 --> 02:16:31,840
just killing an animal.
It's about the whole adventure,

2959
02:16:31,841 --> 02:16:33,940
the whole package.
And uh,

2960
02:16:33,960 --> 02:16:36,310
I was with an outfitter and the guides 
like,

2961
02:16:36,311 --> 02:16:37,000
oh,
you tagged out,

2962
02:16:37,001 --> 02:16:37,810
what do you want to do?
I'm like,

2963
02:16:37,811 --> 02:16:40,120
well,
let's go explore it and go walk.

2964
02:16:40,121 --> 02:16:42,190
And steel and just take photos of the 
country,

2965
02:16:42,191 --> 02:16:44,020
saw it or whatever.
Um,

2966
02:16:44,200 --> 02:16:46,810
you put that all up on your blog to 
write it in a magazine,

2967
02:16:47,260 --> 02:16:52,260
a magazine that one on there.
Read that actually it might be on both 

2968
02:16:52,260 --> 02:16:52,260
sides.
Dot Com.

2969
02:16:52,260 --> 02:16:55,750
I think I did a live one anyway.
Go up on top of these Mesa and uh,

2970
02:16:55,751 --> 02:17:00,751
you can see these rock a,
like a huge rock and new shakes which 

2971
02:17:00,751 --> 02:17:02,770
used to be like the Anasazi Indians.

2972
02:17:02,890 --> 02:17:05,170
That's how I used to have their housing 
and stuff like that.

2973
02:17:05,560 --> 02:17:08,800
Perfect spot right up high.
Looking down onto these big meadows.

2974
02:17:08,801 --> 02:17:12,790
Like it would've been the perfect place 
to if other tribes were coming in,

2975
02:17:13,030 --> 02:17:18,030
you'd be able to say them.
And if any animals working for moving 

2976
02:17:18,030 --> 02:17:21,271
through there,
you'd be able to see them just the 

2977
02:17:21,271 --> 02:17:21,271
perfect spot.
And we'd get up there.

2978
02:17:21,271 --> 02:17:24,990
And as I get to the top,
the first thing you find is a bunch of 

2979
02:17:24,990 --> 02:17:24,990
pottery.
And uh,

2980
02:17:24,990 --> 02:17:29,580
the Anasazi had a certain color,
I think it was the white with the black 

2981
02:17:29,580 --> 02:17:33,840
writing on the pottery.
And the Navajos had the orange with the 

2982
02:17:33,840 --> 02:17:36,820
white writing on the pottery and there's
both types sitting in this area,

2983
02:17:36,821 --> 02:17:41,821
so I don't know if there's a bit of 
confusion or maybe I'm lacking a bit of 

2984
02:17:41,821 --> 02:17:42,090
information there,
but as far as I've looked into those,

2985
02:17:42,100 --> 02:17:45,570
the Anasazi Indians and it's the hallway
or,

2986
02:17:45,571 --> 02:17:47,560
and they liked this,
must've been some major.

2987
02:17:47,560 --> 02:17:51,070
Saw it dude.
I found a perfect stone.

2988
02:17:51,090 --> 02:17:56,050
Broadhead just sitting right there on a 
rock and it just rained.

2989
02:17:56,051 --> 02:17:58,540
So everything was clean.
Everything was clean.

2990
02:17:58,930 --> 02:18:01,630
I picked it up and like my mind boggled 
straight away.

2991
02:18:01,631 --> 02:18:04,540
Like why,
how did this get here?

2992
02:18:04,541 --> 02:18:06,430
Who held it?
Did they shoot it?

2993
02:18:06,460 --> 02:18:08,440
Who Shop?
And the history behind it.

2994
02:18:09,040 --> 02:18:12,220
And um,
then so we kept walking around.

2995
02:18:12,610 --> 02:18:16,150
I found a full ax head dude.
Like obviously the team has gone off the

2996
02:18:16,151 --> 02:18:18,800
ax because it's been there for so long.
The team has just brought it,

2997
02:18:18,870 --> 02:18:20,920
the nothing.
The ax hates sitting there.

2998
02:18:20,921 --> 02:18:23,110
Perfect.
We ended up finding three ax heads,

2999
02:18:23,430 --> 02:18:24,730
uh,
Indian pendant,

3000
02:18:25,090 --> 02:18:30,090
you know,
if the perfect little hole like scribed 

3001
02:18:30,090 --> 02:18:30,090
in it.
And just like crazy.

3002
02:18:30,090 --> 02:18:35,041
Dude.
Did you bring that bag with you because 

3003
02:18:35,041 --> 02:18:35,041
it was privately handles.
I was able to take it.

3004
02:18:35,041 --> 02:18:36,480
You take a photo,
the of the uh,

3005
02:18:36,800 --> 02:18:37,680
broadhead.
Yep.

3006
02:18:37,870 --> 02:18:38,770
Good.
All that document.

3007
02:18:39,300 --> 02:18:44,300
Those fascinate me.
I was nearly going to give you the 

3008
02:18:44,300 --> 02:18:44,300
broadest.
I'm like,

3009
02:18:44,300 --> 02:18:46,710
that's taken it to fucking deserve it.
You can add the buffalo skull.

3010
02:18:46,740 --> 02:18:51,740
I shed a tear.
Just pot with that buffalo skull and 

3011
02:18:51,740 --> 02:18:52,780
buffalo skills.
It doesn't matter.

3012
02:18:53,210 --> 02:18:58,210
They will mean something to Bert was 
saying today.

3013
02:18:58,390 --> 02:19:03,390
He killed the dog.

3014
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,690
The cat things freaks people out about 
Australia.

3015
02:19:12,691 --> 02:19:17,691
That dog freaks people out as well,
but it's no different than shooting a 

3016
02:19:17,691 --> 02:19:20,860
coyote here a problem.
Animal dingoes will one of the first.

3017
02:19:20,950 --> 02:19:25,950
They believe one of the first introduced
species in Australia and it come with 

3018
02:19:25,950 --> 02:19:27,260
the indigenous population at some point.
Oh,

3019
02:19:27,261 --> 02:19:28,100
so they came with

3020
02:19:28,110 --> 02:19:29,520
indigenous people?
Yup.

3021
02:19:29,600 --> 02:19:34,110
So the indigenous people out there,
wild dogs is Dingo.

3022
02:19:34,111 --> 02:19:39,111
Sorry,
is most of them aren't dingoes anymore 

3023
02:19:39,111 --> 02:19:41,441
because there's been a wild dog 
population that's sort of peppered 

3024
02:19:41,441 --> 02:19:43,850
through there as well.
Dingoes and w and normal dogs,

3025
02:19:43,851 --> 02:19:47,690
like a domestic dog that's gone wild had
now in a bread and I,

3026
02:19:47,840 --> 02:19:52,840
I'm pretty sure that any place you can 
find a purebred Dingo now is on Fraser 

3027
02:19:52,840 --> 02:19:56,650
Island in Australia.
They've got a policy or regulations that

3028
02:19:56,651 --> 02:20:00,200
is not allowed to be any domestic 
animals taken to the island and also the

3029
02:20:00,201 --> 02:20:02,930
population stayed pure.
Oh Wow.

3030
02:20:03,320 --> 02:20:05,780
So if you live there,
you can't have a dog.

3031
02:20:06,530 --> 02:20:08,180
I don't think he can live on the island 
at all.

3032
02:20:08,330 --> 02:20:09,700
Oh yeah.
It's one of those things.

3033
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:15,000
Yeah.
Kind of weird rules about wade roses 

3034
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:19,360
that you can't hunt anything native.
That's very strange to me that they 

3035
02:20:19,360 --> 02:20:19,820
wouldn't just have to.
But you have.

3036
02:20:20,190 --> 02:20:24,140
Kangaroos are on some of our currency,
so they're like our icon.

3037
02:20:24,141 --> 02:20:27,890
So imagine eight annual Bodega,
like eight and year American icon.

3038
02:20:28,420 --> 02:20:31,070
So that's one way to look at it by 
chicken,

3039
02:20:31,100 --> 02:20:34,430
but we kind of need a kid news all 
frigging wombats or anything like that?

3040
02:20:34,460 --> 02:20:36,050
No,
not that I'd probably want to,

3041
02:20:36,290 --> 02:20:40,070
but people do eat kangaroo though.
That's why I'm confused.

3042
02:20:40,220 --> 02:20:42,410
And the indigenous cancer,
Dingo big,

3043
02:20:42,460 --> 02:20:43,810
good looking dog.
She will,

3044
02:20:43,811 --> 02:20:47,570
you know,
that'd be Fraser Island dog.

3045
02:20:47,580 --> 02:20:49,840
There you go.
So that's a look at them on the lake.

3046
02:20:51,940 --> 02:20:56,940
It's a beautiful dog that feels like you
could take that thing as a puppy and 

3047
02:20:56,940 --> 02:20:56,940
raise it.
There's,

3048
02:20:56,940 --> 02:21:00,510
I've got a buddy who had one habit,
goatees little girl,

3049
02:21:00,511 --> 02:21:05,511
like try and grab these little go when 
he had it as a puppy or not just a wild 

3050
02:21:05,540 --> 02:21:09,950
one that come into the tent and tried to
grab him ripping a wallet down there.

3051
02:21:10,790 --> 02:21:13,070
So what happened?
Um,

3052
02:21:14,180 --> 02:21:19,180
he ended up killing the dog.
He founded the next morning and not 

3053
02:21:19,180 --> 02:21:22,320
shooting it was a wall Dingo,
but Dingo ate my baby and I some truth 

3054
02:21:23,120 --> 02:21:24,440
to that.
Oh yeah.

3055
02:21:24,470 --> 02:21:26,720
I've seen.
How should they go fishing?

3056
02:21:26,750 --> 02:21:31,750
Jesus Christ while eating a shark on a 
beach,

3057
02:21:31,940 --> 02:21:36,940
that theft fucking cool photo as a 
gangster ass dog when it got a lot of 

3058
02:21:38,900 --> 02:21:41,990
meat.
I wonder if someone actually call it the

3059
02:21:41,991 --> 02:21:43,550
shark.
And that's another thing that people are

3060
02:21:43,551 --> 02:21:44,980
freaking out about it here in America.

3061
02:21:45,020 --> 02:21:48,500
It's most recent freakouts people 
fishing and catching sharks.

3062
02:21:48,950 --> 02:21:53,950
Simon and strike that.
It used to be able to buy Maaco Shark.

3063
02:21:55,251 --> 02:22:00,251
It was very common for most flake and 
the stuff that you bond shock,

3064
02:22:01,600 --> 02:22:03,890
you know,
like when you buy like a bad bit of fish

3065
02:22:03,950 --> 02:22:06,980
or something like that from one of them 
quick type wise it does fish and chips.

3066
02:22:07,790 --> 02:22:11,570
Then most of that's actually flight,
which is just a shock really?

3067
02:22:11,571 --> 02:22:12,040
Yeah.
Yeah.

3068
02:22:12,060 --> 02:22:12,490
No,
no,

3069
02:22:12,640 --> 02:22:14,270
no.
Specific Australia?

3070
02:22:14,330 --> 02:22:15,620
No,
I probably hate to.

3071
02:22:15,710 --> 02:22:20,710
Do you think they're serving a lot of 
tapes of him and there's a ton of them 

3072
02:22:20,710 --> 02:22:24,110
that get into next net.
That's where they go really taste good.

3073
02:22:24,590 --> 02:22:26,580
I've eaten Maaco sharp before and is 
delicious.

3074
02:22:26,581 --> 02:22:28,830
And electric swordfish.
It's the same as anything.

3075
02:22:28,860 --> 02:22:30,720
As long as we're not freaking killing a 
male.

3076
02:22:30,780 --> 02:22:32,790
Well,
you know what happens is people find out

3077
02:22:32,791 --> 02:22:34,860
that a lot of people are killing them 
for Finn's.

3078
02:22:34,920 --> 02:22:39,920
Okay.
Warning your fish and chips could 

3079
02:22:39,920 --> 02:22:42,630
actually be shark.
Damn a bad motherfucker.

3080
02:22:42,631 --> 02:22:45,540
Boy,
this is drying last nine Bogan.

3081
02:22:46,080 --> 02:22:48,170
Okay.
Hey,

3082
02:22:48,280 --> 02:22:51,020
good fit rod into Australia last night.
Like bogus.

3083
02:22:51,420 --> 02:22:52,590
Cashed up.
Bogans.

3084
02:22:53,730 --> 02:22:55,730
Did you tell me that?
You might have told me that expression.

3085
02:22:56,280 --> 02:23:00,390
Kim talking smack far so,
um,

3086
02:23:00,600 --> 02:23:05,600
but I think what happened was over here 
the people found out about how many 

3087
02:23:05,600 --> 02:23:09,411
sharks get killed for the fins shark fin
soup and there was a big campaign to 

3088
02:23:09,411 --> 02:23:09,890
alert people about it.
And,

3089
02:23:10,200 --> 02:23:15,200
and so then the people that have just 
barely a peripheral awareness of 

3090
02:23:15,200 --> 02:23:17,640
conservation and fishing and,
and animal life,

3091
02:23:17,820 --> 02:23:20,190
then they started going to kill sharks.
Sharks.

3092
02:23:20,280 --> 02:23:22,500
They're assholes.
Meanwhile they're eating a cod.

3093
02:23:22,740 --> 02:23:27,740
Exactly.
Having some salmon for lunch on the 

3094
02:23:27,740 --> 02:23:27,740
salad.
Would you eat this fish?

3095
02:23:27,740 --> 02:23:29,190
A shark called the dog fish makes it 
tasty.

3096
02:23:29,191 --> 02:23:29,760
Taco.
Yeah.

3097
02:23:29,761 --> 02:23:31,050
I need to fuck out of a dog.

3098
02:23:31,060 --> 02:23:33,330
Fish me.
It's still a fish.

3099
02:23:33,390 --> 02:23:34,860
I mean,
it's not efficient shark,

3100
02:23:34,861 --> 02:23:38,880
but I just don't understand why people 
would differentiate between that.

3101
02:23:38,881 --> 02:23:41,180
And tonight.
How about you assholes that really loves

3102
02:23:41,181 --> 02:23:46,181
Sushi.
Back the fuck off of the tuna because 

3103
02:23:46,181 --> 02:23:46,800
they're killing all the Goddamn tuna.
There's probably more sharks.

3104
02:23:46,801 --> 02:23:48,150
There are tuna.
They.

3105
02:23:48,430 --> 02:23:53,430
Yeah.
There's some pretty strict regulations 

3106
02:23:53,430 --> 02:23:54,760
in Australia.
The whole world needs to know.

3107
02:23:55,050 --> 02:23:58,440
There's some regulations that have come 
into the northern territory of Australia

3108
02:23:58,441 --> 02:24:01,890
now because you can actually shoot a 
magpie geese with a bow and arrow.

3109
02:24:02,250 --> 02:24:07,250
So there's magpie geese and introduced 
turkeys like what you guys have here in 

3110
02:24:07,250 --> 02:24:11,061
the states,
they're the only birds that you can 

3111
02:24:11,061 --> 02:24:11,061
shoot with a bone.
Our window Australia.

3112
02:24:11,061 --> 02:24:15,140
Oh really?
So they just brought in a season for 

3113
02:24:15,140 --> 02:24:15,450
magpie geese,
which really restricts a lot of the.

3114
02:24:15,451 --> 02:24:17,100
Honda's taken too many,
which is fine.

3115
02:24:17,190 --> 02:24:19,530
I think that that's probably not a bad 
thing,

3116
02:24:20,100 --> 02:24:25,100
but then these birds fly to other 
countries where there's no restrictions 

3117
02:24:25,100 --> 02:24:25,950
at all and they just fucking get 
hammered.

3118
02:24:25,951 --> 02:24:30,951
Dude.
So it's like we're doing everything we 

3119
02:24:30,951 --> 02:24:33,231
can on our part,
but I just go somewhere else and get 

3120
02:24:33,231 --> 02:24:33,231
slower than any line.
Well you don't understand.

3121
02:24:33,280 --> 02:24:36,940
No issues with the shocks as well.
Like they've,

3122
02:24:37,370 --> 02:24:42,370
there's a few spaces that are highly 
protected in Australia but they swim 

3123
02:24:42,370 --> 02:24:45,320
abroad and they fair game for anyone but
eats great whites though right now that 

3124
02:24:45,320 --> 02:24:49,761
I know of,
but I guess people would if they were 

3125
02:24:49,761 --> 02:24:49,761
starved,
I would for sure.

3126
02:24:49,761 --> 02:24:53,270
I mean,
it's probably just fish tastes pretty 

3127
02:24:53,270 --> 02:24:56,151
good.
I don't think that gave up too fucking 

3128
02:24:56,151 --> 02:24:57,951
easy.
That's another monster live and monster 

3129
02:24:57,951 --> 02:24:57,951
dual.
Yeah.

3130
02:24:57,951 --> 02:24:59,110
Legit monster.
Yeah.

3131
02:24:59,220 --> 02:25:04,220
There was an instance in San Diego a few
years back were these bunch of these 

3132
02:25:04,220 --> 02:25:08,991
people were training for a triathlon and
they were swimming in the ocean and one 

3133
02:25:08,991 --> 02:25:08,991
out of nowhere.

3134
02:25:08,991 --> 02:25:13,980
I just came and cut this guy and half of
everybody else just bit him right at the

3135
02:25:14,521 --> 02:25:19,521
waist.
This scary dude shot them right in half 

3136
02:25:19,521 --> 02:25:20,760
chomp besides conserving their live 
shark.

3137
02:25:20,761 --> 02:25:25,761
Meat can be terribly unhealthy.
According to CNN report from nearly 20 

3138
02:25:25,761 --> 02:25:29,310
years ago,
the mercury levels in sharks can cause 

3139
02:25:29,310 --> 02:25:29,310
coordination,
loss blindness,

3140
02:25:29,310 --> 02:25:33,781
and even deaths.
Scientists think that sharks accumulate 

3141
02:25:33,781 --> 02:25:34,840
mercury in their body because they eat 
many smaller fish.

3142
02:25:34,841 --> 02:25:37,480
That's interesting.
Why you shouldn't eat shark meat.

3143
02:25:37,960 --> 02:25:41,440
It doesn't and have a lot of mercury in 
it as well.

3144
02:25:41,500 --> 02:25:42,760
I don't know.
They say,

3145
02:25:43,520 --> 02:25:46,420
I don't like to eat Marlin,
you know,

3146
02:25:46,421 --> 02:25:49,990
but I've heard Marlin's good.
I think a lot of those big fish,

3147
02:25:49,991 --> 02:25:51,940
especially the prey to the ones a full 
of mercury.

3148
02:25:52,020 --> 02:25:53,370
Makes Sense.
Yeah,

3149
02:25:53,620 --> 02:25:57,130
I mean it's like predators in general 
have a lot of weird things going on with

3150
02:25:57,131 --> 02:26:02,131
their body if you eat them,
you know like mountain lions can be 

3151
02:26:02,131 --> 02:26:02,131
tricky.

3152
02:26:02,131 --> 02:26:03,940
GNOSIS interesting study like a,
it says at the top of the article,

3153
02:26:03,970 --> 02:26:07,720
an estimated 100 million sharks are 
killed each year to feed consumer demand

3154
02:26:07,770 --> 02:26:12,430
and then the study came from a report of
a 124 sharks that were tested in.

3155
02:26:12,431 --> 02:26:17,431
One third of them came in with mercury 
levels that were over FDA action level 

3156
02:26:17,431 --> 02:26:21,390
of one part per million.
So 100 million sharks every year.

3157
02:26:21,410 --> 02:26:24,970
One hundred and 24 had a third of those 
were problematic.

3158
02:26:24,971 --> 02:26:29,620
So 30 sharks were problematic or so 40 
out of how many.

3159
02:26:29,650 --> 02:26:31,560
But they didn't test that many though,
right?

3160
02:26:31,590 --> 02:26:34,600
I mean they didn't test 100 million.
The tests at 140 were bad.

3161
02:26:35,070 --> 02:26:35,890
Ooh,
that's not good.

3162
02:26:35,920 --> 02:26:38,260
That's not good.
It's real bad you think?

3163
02:26:38,290 --> 02:26:39,850
Yeah,
that's terrible.

3164
02:26:39,900 --> 02:26:41,800
Doesn't say maybe they were all one area
too.

3165
02:26:41,830 --> 02:26:44,170
They could have came out of one shitty 
maybe area.

3166
02:26:44,171 --> 02:26:47,650
And I've told this story 100 times,
but I'll say it again just quickly.

3167
02:26:47,710 --> 02:26:52,710
I had arsenic in my body from when I did
a blood test and he said,

3168
02:26:53,080 --> 02:26:54,190
what are you eating?
And I said,

3169
02:26:54,191 --> 02:26:56,410
I eat a lot of sardines,
and the guy said,

3170
02:26:56,411 --> 02:26:58,600
back off the sardines,
we'll try it again in a couple of weeks.

3171
02:26:58,900 --> 02:27:02,760
And the arsenic was gone.
Eating two cans of Sardines Day.

3172
02:27:02,770 --> 02:27:05,650
I love sardines.
I don't know why I like sardines on.

3173
02:27:05,660 --> 02:27:07,220
Totally love them.
They're great.

3174
02:27:09,230 --> 02:27:11,140
Came back road swordfish.
Yep.

3175
02:27:11,340 --> 02:27:13,360
Oh,
do not eat shark swordfish.

3176
02:27:13,361 --> 02:27:18,361
King Mackerel or tile fish.
Because they contain high levels of 

3177
02:27:18,361 --> 02:27:18,760
mercury.
I've heard that about tune as well.

3178
02:27:18,850 --> 02:27:23,850
I don't know those certain areas.
Some tuna apparently contains high 

3179
02:27:23,850 --> 02:27:28,621
levels of mercury were assholes.
I was reading something about fucking 

3180
02:27:28,621 --> 02:27:31,780
crabs.
I put it up on my twitter that crabs are

3181
02:27:32,170 --> 02:27:37,170
getting Prozac in the water from human 
beings like because somebody fucking nut

3182
02:27:37,751 --> 02:27:42,751
bags are on Prozac that it's getting 
into the oceans through runoff and it's 

3183
02:27:42,751 --> 02:27:44,410
affecting crab behavior and it's making 
crabs reckless.

3184
02:27:44,760 --> 02:27:48,430
And I already saved pretty fucking 
reckless.

3185
02:27:48,740 --> 02:27:49,800
No,
they're bugs.

3186
02:27:50,020 --> 02:27:55,020
Right?
But apparently it's making the reckless 

3187
02:27:55,020 --> 02:27:55,020
area.
It goes.

3188
02:27:55,020 --> 02:27:58,180
Roseanne,
puts crabs in a mood to take deadly 

3189
02:27:58,180 --> 02:27:59,920
risks.
Shit that with me and Andrew Equals.

3190
02:28:03,030 --> 02:28:05,110
I mean what the fuck?
I mean,

3191
02:28:05,111 --> 02:28:10,111
how crazy is the human race where we are
giving PROZAC inadvertently to fucking 

3192
02:28:11,351 --> 02:28:16,351
crabs and they're at a risk.
Apparently they're worried about the 

3193
02:28:16,930 --> 02:28:20,950
population dying off or at least being 
affected.

3194
02:28:21,260 --> 02:28:21,980
These crabs

3195
02:28:22,280 --> 02:28:27,170
are doing reckless things and it's going
to cause them to get preyed upon or die.

3196
02:28:28,070 --> 02:28:29,630
What the fuck man?
Shit,

3197
02:28:29,930 --> 02:28:33,020
crap brains on Ssri.
But what is that word?

3198
02:28:33,110 --> 02:28:35,180
How do you say that word?
Jamie flew.

3199
02:28:35,270 --> 02:28:40,270
Locks is a class of antidepressant 
called SSRI or selective serotonin 

3200
02:28:41,571 --> 02:28:44,390
reuptake inhibitor,
meaning that indirectly boosie amount of

3201
02:28:44,391 --> 02:28:46,580
mood altering serotonin available to the
brain.

3202
02:28:47,180 --> 02:28:52,180
It's designed to affect people's brains 
in a way that can alleviate depressive 

3203
02:28:52,180 --> 02:28:55,451
symptoms.
But past research has shown that when a 

3204
02:28:55,451 --> 02:28:57,290
person's flew ox,
team filled,

3205
02:28:57,291 --> 02:29:00,620
waste enters,
flew their shit and Piss,

3206
02:29:00,800 --> 02:29:03,340
and there's the waterways.
It can alter the shores,

3207
02:29:03,350 --> 02:29:05,390
crabs,
reproductive molting,

3208
02:29:05,391 --> 02:29:10,391
and digestive behaviors and may even 
cause the crabs to abandon their 

3209
02:29:10,391 --> 02:29:11,960
nocturnal schedule according to the 
paper.

3210
02:29:12,260 --> 02:29:12,740
Wow.

3211
02:29:13,560 --> 02:29:15,070
Humans.
And we're,

3212
02:29:15,090 --> 02:29:16,480
well,
we're definitely a mess.

3213
02:29:17,120 --> 02:29:18,490
A definitely.
Speaking of that.

3214
02:29:18,820 --> 02:29:19,990
Let's get outta here and go get 
something to eat.

3215
02:29:20,050 --> 02:29:20,920
Yeah,
that sounds awesome.

3216
02:29:20,921 --> 02:29:24,450
I feel like I need to get you to say 
that you come into Australia,

3217
02:29:24,480 --> 02:29:26,300
come to Australia eventually.
I'll do some shit.

3218
02:29:26,320 --> 02:29:28,320
Go to a nice restaurant,
have dinner,

3219
02:29:28,520 --> 02:29:32,950
come hunting deer killed by browns to 
ask you one fucking protect you.

3220
02:29:32,951 --> 02:29:35,560
If if I die in everybody who likes this 
podcast,

3221
02:29:35,590 --> 02:29:37,830
no longer gets a podcast,
there'll be fucking mad at you.

3222
02:29:37,860 --> 02:29:41,950
But bringing me to Australia,
it'll be leather skin mocking.

3223
02:29:41,951 --> 02:29:43,480
Worth.
It takes forever to eat.

3224
02:29:43,510 --> 02:29:45,800
You need to come meet you and Cam.
Alright,

3225
02:29:45,820 --> 02:29:50,820
we'll work something out.
Maybe just say go to Hawaii and shoot 

3226
02:29:51,580 --> 02:29:55,480
axis deer resort.
Come on,

3227
02:29:55,540 --> 02:29:58,720
land hunt.
Buffalo sounds terrible.

3228
02:29:58,880 --> 02:30:03,640
No,
listen to what nick buff paste together.

3229
02:30:03,840 --> 02:30:08,840
Very authentic,
getting chased by salt water crocodiles 

3230
02:30:08,840 --> 02:30:10,260
and watch brown snakes slithering into 
our camp.

3231
02:30:10,290 --> 02:30:12,500
Probably like,
thanks for having me on the challenge.

3232
02:30:12,510 --> 02:30:14,090
And brother always.
Jamie,

3233
02:30:14,110 --> 02:30:15,750
Adam Green Tree.
Ladies and gentlemen.

3234
02:30:15,770 --> 02:30:16,880

3237
02:30:22,711 --> 02:30:27,711

Adam and Eve cain was wearing a shirt 

3238
02:30:27,711 --> 02:30:30,090
that I think she's adorable.
That's adorable.

3239
02:30:30,150 --> 02:30:31,110
All right.

3240
02:30:31,111 --> 02:30:32,160
