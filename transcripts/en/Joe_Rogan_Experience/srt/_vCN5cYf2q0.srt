1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,390
Do do five,
four,

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:04,500
three,
two,

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,980
one young.
Jamie gave me the fake gun.

4
00:00:07,981 --> 00:00:09,440
Pointy fingers.
So alive.

5
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:10,130
Chris,
Ryan,

6
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:10,963
Hawaii,
brother.

7
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:12,810
I'm live.
It's good to be live.

8
00:00:12,811 --> 00:00:13,644
Joe,
you haven't gotten any of this 

9
00:00:14,251 --> 00:00:16,320
interdimensional child molester.
We'd yet.

10
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:18,950
I've been probed.
I don't know who was doing it,

11
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:21,370
but somebody was probing me.
Interdimensionally.

12
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:22,140
I'll tell you that.

13
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:22,973
Just about to talk about getting Alex 
Jones high on the podcast before we 

14
00:00:25,411 --> 00:00:26,580
start.
And I said save it.

15
00:00:26,581 --> 00:00:27,414
You got to say,

16
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,340
well see,
I'm not that tuned into who he is.

17
00:00:31,341 --> 00:00:32,520
I,
I just hear you know,

18
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:36,860
occasionally Alex Jones is this right 
wing conspiracy guy and I never listened

19
00:00:36,861 --> 00:00:37,694
to him.
So I saw you was on your show and I was 

20
00:00:39,411 --> 00:00:40,244
working at home doing some shit around 
the house so I put it on youtube so I 

21
00:00:42,381 --> 00:00:43,214
could actually see him doing this.
Taking these things off the headphones 

22
00:00:45,981 --> 00:00:48,400
on and off.
Oh my God man.

23
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,460
And like for the first hour,
hour and a half,

24
00:00:52,461 --> 00:00:54,410
I was like,
fuck this guy,

25
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:55,303
about half of what he says actually kind
of makes sense to me and he's obviously 

26
00:00:59,931 --> 00:01:03,350
really smart.
High Iq off the fucking charts,

27
00:01:03,351 --> 00:01:04,184
no doubt,
but then he would just veer off and the 

28
00:01:09,681 --> 00:01:12,740
more we add in whiskey got involved,
the more it was just like,

29
00:01:12,741 --> 00:01:16,610
this is performance art.
This is just nuts.

30
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:17,750
Beyond that,

31
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:18,670
once he started,
right,

32
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:20,200
right before the podcast,
man,

33
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:22,540
I want to get a drink and he,
he,

34
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,433
he had some whiskey.
Did he have some whiskey before I got 

35
00:01:24,561 --> 00:01:27,620
here?
I've been right as you got it right as I

36
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,930
go.
So I was already here and he's like,

37
00:01:29,931 --> 00:01:31,220
well before we get started,
let me give it,

38
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,113
let me get a drink real quick.
And he went back and I had a drink with 

39
00:01:34,131 --> 00:01:34,611
them.
I'm like,

40
00:01:34,611 --> 00:01:36,110
listen,
I'm not going to let them drink alone.

41
00:01:36,111 --> 00:01:36,950
We're going to do this.
Right.

42
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:38,053
But it was a dangerous proposition 
because Eddie Bravo was here and Eddie 

43
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,953
Bravo is Mexican and Joey Diaz says that
Mexicans are basically a native 

44
00:01:48,591 --> 00:01:50,360
Americans,
which he's right.

45
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:51,950
You know,
like there's,

46
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,060
there's Mexicans that were native 
Americans that bread with the Spanish.

47
00:01:56,061 --> 00:01:59,360
You would know more about this having 
lived in Spain and so that's why.

48
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:00,730
Yeah,
I mean so.

49
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:03,540
And when grid with Mexicans and 
Spaniard,

50
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,950
I don't breed with anyone.
Not really,

51
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:08,430
but attempted breeding.
I've gone through the motions.

52
00:02:08,431 --> 00:02:11,030
Yeah.
But you know,

53
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:11,864
they look like some of them look like 
people from Spain and some of them look 

54
00:02:14,691 --> 00:02:16,430
like native Americans.
It's kind of interesting,

55
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,390
like Mexico is a kind of really diverse 
sort of a genetic line.

56
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,370
Um,
but so,

57
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,263
you know,
the old stereotype about native 

58
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:28,970
Americans that you can get them drunk 
and the Indian goes fucking crazy.

59
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,530
Well,
Eddie Bravo,

60
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,453
who's Mexican.
Joey Diaz is always saying you get them 

61
00:02:32,871 --> 00:02:34,370
drunk.
That fucking Indian comes out.

62
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,240
And that is exactly what happened.
Yeah.

63
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,490
So we got Eddie drunk and he just went 
off the fucking rails with.

64
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:44,570
He thinks the government sprain shit in 
the sky and he's been saying it forever,

65
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,050
so,
so much so that he's constantly got legs

66
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:50,330
confirmation bias thing where he's 
constantly looking to confirm.

67
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:51,343
So he just had this agenda that he had 
to talk to Alex Jones even after you 

68
00:02:54,381 --> 00:02:56,150
talked about interdimensional child 
molesters,

69
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,110
right in Obama's mother sea sex work.

70
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,210
Still crazy.
Oh,

71
00:03:04,211 --> 00:03:05,044
he's awesome.
I think people got a chance to see what 

72
00:03:07,691 --> 00:03:09,580
I see in him because like,
everybody's like,

73
00:03:09,581 --> 00:03:11,740
how can you be friends with Alex Jones?
I'm telling you,

74
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:14,440
he's a great guy.
He's a great guy,

75
00:03:14,441 --> 00:03:16,780
he's a lot of fun and he's right about a
lot of shit.

76
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:17,961
Well,
the thing,

77
00:03:17,961 --> 00:03:18,794
alright,
somebody emailed me this morning and 

78
00:03:20,331 --> 00:03:21,180
they're like,
uh,

79
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:22,730
you know,
because I had said,

80
00:03:22,731 --> 00:03:23,570
I tweeted like,
Hey,

81
00:03:23,571 --> 00:03:25,520
this guy is actually making sense.
And they were like,

82
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,600
dude,
he's like a.

83
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:29,750
He denies the Sandy Hook massacre.
Is that true?

84
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:30,740
I don't know.
Is that true?

85
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:33,080
That's such,
that's it.

86
00:03:33,081 --> 00:03:34,430
I mean,
that's the kind of thing that for me,

87
00:03:34,431 --> 00:03:36,650
it's like if he's denying that,
then fuck that guy.

88
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:38,120
He's saying,
you know,

89
00:03:38,121 --> 00:03:40,790
Obama's mother was a CIA sex worker.
That's just funny.

90
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,190
But the,
I mean,

91
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,520
I don't know.
You know what?

92
00:03:43,521 --> 00:03:45,820
I think this is my,
my take on him and I,

93
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,360
like I said,
I love this guy dearly.

94
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,013
Um,
I feel like he's a high high power 

95
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:54,090
corvette engine.
Yeah.

96
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:59,310
But some of the spark plugs are not 
totally connected.

97
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:03,520
Yeah.
So like the Obama's wife is a CIA,

98
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:08,620
Mama's Mama was a cia sex slave and 
sandy hook and we've got the documents.

99
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:09,663
There's a few of those things that get 
through where maybe if he had someone 

100
00:04:12,131 --> 00:04:15,530
next to them going,
let's look at this objective.

101
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,310
He,
isn't it possible that this could be the

102
00:04:18,311 --> 00:04:19,144
case or isn't it possible that that 
could be the case and it's the opposite 

103
00:04:21,081 --> 00:04:22,780
of what he's got is millions of people 
saying,

104
00:04:22,781 --> 00:04:24,070
yeah,
give us more of that.

105
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:28,300
People fucking love conspiracy theories.
They loved them,

106
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,340
they loved them and you know,
see,

107
00:04:30,341 --> 00:04:31,570
this is where I was.

108
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,990
I was surprised to be agreeing with them
because.

109
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:39,090
Because we do live in a conspiracy,
it is a conspiracy.

110
00:04:39,091 --> 00:04:44,040
Modern civilization is a fucking lie.
So I agree that,

111
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:45,680
you know,
where he saying like,

112
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:46,920
you know,
we're being.

113
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:47,813
He was talking about sort of,
I think he gets into lizard people and 

114
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,180
that kind of thing.
He does.

115
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,830
No,
he doesn't get into lizard people.

116
00:04:52,831 --> 00:04:54,000
All right,
well I'm David Eick.

117
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:54,661
Oh,
okay.

118
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:58,400
I,
I get into a super organisms,

119
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:00,630
like I think we're embedded in a super 
organism.

120
00:05:00,631 --> 00:05:02,430
You and I've talked about this before,
I think,

121
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:03,803
and that's why we as a species are doing
things that are detrimental to our own 

122
00:05:07,921 --> 00:05:08,754
interests as individual human beings 
because we are embedded in the super 

123
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:15,900
organism just like our bacteria is 
embedded in us and you know,

124
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:19,230
using the super organism,
the earth itself,

125
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,460
like what do you think?

126
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:24,450
It's technology too.
And so,

127
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,493
uh,
I mean you and I and Duncan and talked 

128
00:05:26,731 --> 00:05:30,300
about this a bunch and we were doing the
shrimp parade thing because I see,

129
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:31,283
I see it as the end of humanity and that
is a negative thing because I kind of 

130
00:05:34,671 --> 00:05:38,160
like,
I like the way we lived for 200,000

131
00:05:38,161 --> 00:05:38,994
years embedded in the environment like 
other animals and pretty fucking happy 

132
00:05:42,391 --> 00:05:44,110
and living in the moment and all that,
you know,

133
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:45,650
uh,
where it's,

134
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:46,483
Duncan thinks it's great that we're 
spreading out into the universe and you 

135
00:05:48,751 --> 00:05:49,584
know,
even if we stopped being humans to do 

136
00:05:51,871 --> 00:05:52,830
that,
which is,

137
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:55,560
it's a,
it's a fascinating conversation.

138
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,530
So anyway,
I'm crazy too,

139
00:05:57,531 --> 00:05:58,310
is my point,

140
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,143
right?
So I think there's a certain amount of 

141
00:06:00,231 --> 00:06:04,070
craziness that certainly called for.
I don't think you're crazy.

142
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:07,220
I think you're looking at like you're 
extrapolating,

143
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,083
you're just looking at what's going on 
and they didn't mean it's really clear 

144
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,570
what you're saying is absolutely 
correct.

145
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:14,900
We're not operating in the best interest
of the species.

146
00:06:14,901 --> 00:06:15,830
Right.
If we continue,

147
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:20,060
do you just see this new crack in the 
fucking Holy Shit.

148
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,373
It's grown over the last couple of 
months by like a mile and the things 

149
00:06:24,261 --> 00:06:26,600
like the size of Delaware or something 
enormous.

150
00:06:26,601 --> 00:06:27,434
And if it breaks off Foxville just a 
gigantic floating iceberg like the size 

151
00:06:33,141 --> 00:06:37,940
of a state might just head to Hawaii and
fucking crash into it.

152
00:06:37,941 --> 00:06:38,774
Like this shocking animation reveals how
massive hell a massive Antarctic crack 

153
00:06:42,411 --> 00:06:45,020
has grown 17 miles in the last two 
months.

154
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:45,970
Hold on,
let's go back.

155
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,950
Let's go back.
Uh,

156
00:06:47,951 --> 00:06:48,784
and experts say it's now inevitable that
it will create one of the biggest 

157
00:06:50,901 --> 00:06:52,910
icebergs ever seen.
Holy Shit.

158
00:06:52,911 --> 00:06:56,930
Inevitable size of Jamaica.
Oh my God.

159
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:59,510
Oh my God.
Look at it.

160
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:01,310
Oh Jesus Christ.

161
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:06,443
It would be so scary to see like a 
floating state in the ocean and 

162
00:07:09,591 --> 00:07:12,260
Fukushima radiation is worse than ever,
ever,

163
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:15,200
and they don't know what to do.
They have no idea how to contain it.

164
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,620
Not all problems are solvable.
No.

165
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:19,880
Yeah.
Well that Fukushima.

166
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:23,120
It scares the shit out of me because 
they don't really know how to shut off a

167
00:07:23,121 --> 00:07:23,954
lot of those ancient power plants.
The ones that they first correct 

168
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:27,374
created.
Essentially they just have to keep 

169
00:07:28,491 --> 00:07:29,990
running,
like grow the fuck.

170
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:33,500
Let whoever the fuck let them do that is
so crazy.

171
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,960
They don't know how to shut them off.
We'll see so much.

172
00:07:35,961 --> 00:07:38,590
A technology is based on this idea that,
you know,

173
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,910
when we need,
when we face the problem,

174
00:07:40,911 --> 00:07:42,800
we'll have an answer to it.
You know,

175
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:45,860
like the disposal of nuclear waste.
Right.

176
00:07:45,861 --> 00:07:48,050
Well we'll figure that out.
We'll shoot it into space or will.

177
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:48,883
We know they have.
They've kind of figured out a way to 

178
00:07:50,331 --> 00:07:51,164
turn nuclear waste into batteries.
They turned it into diamonds that lasts 

179
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:57,140
for like they embedded into diamonds and
it can last.

180
00:07:57,141 --> 00:07:57,691
What was it?
The,

181
00:07:57,691 --> 00:07:58,524
the,
the technology of the battery can last 

182
00:07:59,601 --> 00:08:01,120
thousands of years.
Really.

183
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,030
Oh,
it's amazing.

184
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:03,620
And let's get on that.
Well,

185
00:08:03,621 --> 00:08:04,790
there was a.
Who was,

186
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:05,653
which podcast was it that we were doing 
where someone was talking about a young 

187
00:08:07,911 --> 00:08:10,540
scientist.
Do you remember who was who?

188
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,553
They were talking about a young 
scientist that has these incredible 

189
00:08:13,521 --> 00:08:16,340
ideas.
Oh yeah,

190
00:08:16,341 --> 00:08:17,390
I was there.
I met him.

191
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:20,880
That was the one I did in 2012 or 11.
He,

192
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:23,240
he does this little reactor in the 
backyard,

193
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:26,310
essentially meant to many podcasts,
but it was,

194
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,193
it was fairly recently.
Just go over the fairly recent podcasts 

195
00:08:29,931 --> 00:08:31,610
and vice did a thing on him.

196
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:33,480
It was Shane Smith.
There you go.

197
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,800
Perfect.
Is Shane Smith from vice?

198
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:38,430
Yeah.
Um,

199
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:39,283
so maybe he's right or maybe people are 
right that we will come up with 

200
00:08:41,391 --> 00:08:42,224
technology that's going to be able to 
figure out a way to solve these 

201
00:08:44,121 --> 00:08:44,930
problems.
Well,

202
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:47,420
but it doesn't see that's the thing here
we are Fukushima,

203
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:48,583
we don't have the technology.
We don't know how to solve it when we 

204
00:08:51,111 --> 00:08:52,400
need it,
you know,

205
00:08:52,401 --> 00:08:55,170
or a year ago or you know,
and dump.

206
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,093
We bear this radio,
diamond batteries making good use of 

207
00:08:58,291 --> 00:08:59,124
nuclear waste,
so they're going to have these diamond 

208
00:09:01,231 --> 00:09:03,990
battery that lasts for thousands of 
years,

209
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,010
which is really incredible because what 
Shane Smith was saying is essentially we

210
00:09:08,011 --> 00:09:12,870
have enough nuclear waste to power the 
earth for thousands of years.

211
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:15,510
Our civilization like we can literally 
stop.

212
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:16,703
We can stop all production of batteries 
and all the different things that we're 

213
00:09:19,531 --> 00:09:20,364
doing coal.
Here's where we're getting into 

214
00:09:21,211 --> 00:09:23,670
conspiracy shit again.
They won't let us do it.

215
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:27,120
They'll shut that shit down because it 
will lose jobs.

216
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:30,510
Like right now they're trying to open 
coal mines again for fucks sake.

217
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,390
You know,
who's they?

218
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,140
Coal miners.
Coal Mine,

219
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:36,780
uh,
unions and coal mine presidents.

220
00:09:36,781 --> 00:09:37,740
And the guy,
you know,

221
00:09:37,741 --> 00:09:38,574
Exxon,
that guy from Exxon who's going to be 

222
00:09:40,231 --> 00:09:41,910
secretary of state,
tillerson.

223
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,710
Wonderful.
That's the guy who said,

224
00:09:43,711 --> 00:09:47,100
what's the point of saving the earth if 
humans have to suffer?

225
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,540
Is that what he said?
Yeah.

226
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:49,973
Smart Guy.

227
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,000
Ridiculous person.
Anyway.

228
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,233
Well,
I don't want to drag us down and 

229
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:58,170
depressing.
Not Depressing.

230
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,493
Yeah,
I think we were right though that what 

231
00:10:00,931 --> 00:10:05,190
you're saying about technology and about
we're serving technology.

232
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,353
I mean,
I've been saying this for a long time 

233
00:10:06,931 --> 00:10:10,020
that I essentially think that what we're
doing is giving birth.

234
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:12,050
We're,
we're a larva form.

235
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,403
Were like some sort of a butterfly 
that's gonna emerge or we will be a 

236
00:10:17,641 --> 00:10:21,180
butterfly and a caterpillar.
Right now we're creating the iphones and

237
00:10:21,181 --> 00:10:22,890
I'm a caterpillar going.
God Damn it.

238
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:26,430
I liked the color stage,
but you don't want to lose it.

239
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,710
Don't you think those single celled 
organisms like guys,

240
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,150
what are we doing?
We're branching out.

241
00:10:30,151 --> 00:10:32,280
We're fucking joining together with 
other cells.

242
00:10:32,281 --> 00:10:33,114
Fuck that man.
I liked being by myself being 

243
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,050
essentially immortal,
immortal,

244
00:10:37,051 --> 00:10:39,210
single celled squid.
It could be,

245
00:10:39,211 --> 00:10:41,790
but when you're,
you're,

246
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,850
uh,
advancing stage requires the destruction

247
00:10:44,851 --> 00:10:47,820
of your entire environment and all the 
other species as well.

248
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,650
That's kind of fucked.
It is fucked.

249
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,390
But I don't know if it's all the 
species.

250
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:54,810
I think rats will be fine if he watched 
that netflix documentary on rats.

251
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:55,740
Yeah.
No,

252
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:58,070
I saw you posted some shit and I was 
like,

253
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:02,010
Nina and I want to see that.
It is amazing.

254
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:04,240
It has no rats will be fine.
Keith Richards,

255
00:11:04,241 --> 00:11:05,074
there'll be fine cockroaches.
I need 25 percent of the species have 

256
00:11:10,261 --> 00:11:13,230
gone extinct in the last generation.
Something like that.

257
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:14,670
Well,
that always happens though.

258
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,360
See,
this is not at this rate.

259
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,390
No,
I mean this is a mass extinction event,

260
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,430
but there's always been mass extinction 
events.

261
00:11:20,431 --> 00:11:21,264
There's been a ton of them and there's 
90 percent of everything that's ever 

262
00:11:23,191 --> 00:11:26,310
lived as dead everything,
every living organism.

263
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:28,710
But that's obscuring the reality,
right?

264
00:11:28,711 --> 00:11:29,544
The rate of extinction right now due to 
human interventions is higher than it's 

265
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:35,640
been in probably hundreds of millions of
years.

266
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:40,910
Young Jamie can look at a case.
So the last major extinction event was,

267
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:42,600
you know,
hundreds of millions of years ago,

268
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:45,210
I think it was 65 million years ago.
The thing is that dinosaurs,

269
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,103
I think it was the what,
what killed off the dinosaurs and there 

270
00:11:47,911 --> 00:11:48,744
was also a major extinction event in 
North America that coincided with the 

271
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,170
end of the Ice Age,
about 10 fold.

272
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:55,000
Right?
Which they attributed to humans.

273
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:55,691
No,
no,

274
00:11:55,691 --> 00:11:56,860
they don't anymore.
Yeah.

275
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:57,733
Well some people do,
but what they're thinking now due to a 

276
00:12:00,431 --> 00:12:04,870
lot of geological data is asteroidal 
impacts.

277
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,640
Oh,
we were at Randall Carson.

278
00:12:06,641 --> 00:12:07,870
Is he on that?
Yeah,

279
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,540
I never bought that human thing.
I think this whole man,

280
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:11,374
the hunter bullshit.
Cause like they didn't even have bows 

281
00:12:13,751 --> 00:12:15,070
and arrows.
They have adult models,

282
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,900
which are cool.
They're cool.

283
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:18,430
They're pretty cool invention.
Good luck.

284
00:12:18,431 --> 00:12:20,050
That's the fucking saber tooth tiger 
with that.

285
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:21,660
The last one too.

286
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:24,250
They're like five left and you're going 
to hunt them down and kill them.

287
00:12:24,251 --> 00:12:25,084
I don't think so.
It just wasn't enough people here to do 

288
00:12:26,351 --> 00:12:27,184
that and it's much more likely 
considering the fact they found these 

289
00:12:30,131 --> 00:12:34,630
essentially like graveyards filled with 
wooly mammoths had died instantaneously.

290
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,560
The asteroid impact theory also a lot 
of,

291
00:12:38,561 --> 00:12:39,311
um,
you know,

292
00:12:39,311 --> 00:12:40,520
the big game died,
the,

293
00:12:40,521 --> 00:12:43,530
the giant,
the carnivores.

294
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:46,000
The big giraffes and all that shit that 
was here,

295
00:12:46,001 --> 00:12:46,834
but also a lot of shellfish went extinct
at the same time and snails and things 

296
00:12:51,191 --> 00:12:52,150
like that.
Here we go.

297
00:12:52,151 --> 00:12:52,984
Extinctions during human error.
Worse than thought the gravity of the 

298
00:12:55,601 --> 00:12:56,434
world's current extinction rate becomes.
It becomes clear upon knowing what it 

299
00:12:59,981 --> 00:13:00,814
was before people came along.
A new estimate finds of species die off 

300
00:13:04,121 --> 00:13:08,050
as much as 1000 times more frequently 
nowadays than they used to.

301
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:12,010
It's 10 times worse than the old 
estimate of 100 times who,

302
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:13,703
oh,
that's not good,

303
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,830
and that's three years ago.

304
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:16,940
This is a three year old article in that
funny,

305
00:13:16,941 --> 00:13:19,540
like three years ago,
people like shit's old bro.

306
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:22,990
Shit's from September Bro.
Isn't it funny?

307
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,413
We're.
We're moving at such a fast rate that 

308
00:13:26,111 --> 00:13:28,370
our minds are kind of tuned into that 
and when anybody.

309
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,310
Someone shows you something,
it's from a year ago.

310
00:13:30,311 --> 00:13:30,850
You're like,
Bro,

311
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:33,640
you're quoting a year old stuff.
Tell me about.

312
00:13:33,641 --> 00:13:37,090
I'm trying to write a book,
like talk about an ancient technology.

313
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:42,310
It's like I'm trying not to refer to 
papers that were published 10 years ago,

314
00:13:42,311 --> 00:13:43,900
but you know,
how can you not,

315
00:13:43,901 --> 00:13:45,940
I mean there's crazy 10 years ago is 
nothing.

316
00:13:45,941 --> 00:13:47,050
Yeah.
Yeah.

317
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:50,500
I mean,
Darwin was a long fucking time ago.

318
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:57,710
What we're looking at is this weird 
accelerated existence and it's,

319
00:13:57,941 --> 00:14:00,550
it's happening right in front of it and 
we sort of acknowledged it,

320
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,830
but we're not recognizing it.
We've acknowledged it.

321
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:03,873
What we can't comprehend it now,
like we're living in a world we can't 

322
00:14:06,611 --> 00:14:07,444
comprehend,
which again gets back to this whole 

323
00:14:08,501 --> 00:14:09,334
hunter gatherer thing.
Like you lived in a world they 

324
00:14:10,421 --> 00:14:11,770
understood,
you know,

325
00:14:11,771 --> 00:14:14,800
this whole,
like we assume the generational,

326
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:18,130
uh,
misunderstanding or sort of common human

327
00:14:18,131 --> 00:14:19,690
behavior,
human experience.

328
00:14:19,691 --> 00:14:20,524
But if you're a hunter gatherer,
your parents and grandparents lived in 

329
00:14:23,051 --> 00:14:25,000
the same world you live in and they do 
now.

330
00:14:25,001 --> 00:14:26,650
I mean,
you saw that recently,

331
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,920
uncontacted tribe like recently 
contacted tribe in Brazil.

332
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,480
I mean,
it's incredible.

333
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:32,700
They're there,
they're live there.

334
00:14:32,701 --> 00:14:34,360
They're a,
they're a time capsule.

335
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:36,520
They're living the way people lived 
100,000

336
00:14:36,521 --> 00:14:37,270
years ago.
Yeah.

337
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,103
It's amazing.
Yeah,

338
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,460
it's really cool.
It's really.

339
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:41,130
The pictures are amazing.
Cds,

340
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,970
people pointing,
bows and arrows,

341
00:14:42,971 --> 00:14:45,670
and helicopters.
What have you ever heard?

342
00:14:45,671 --> 00:14:46,504
There's a great book called at play in 
the fields of the Lord by Peter 

343
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:50,291
Matheson's.
I've heard of it.

344
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:52,010
I've never read it.
It's a beautiful bug man.

345
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:55,250
It's a really good film to Daryl Hannah,
John Lithgow,

346
00:14:55,251 --> 00:14:57,440
Kathy Bates,
amazing cast.

347
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,940
Um,
but,

348
00:14:58,941 --> 00:14:59,990
uh,
it's about,

349
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:02,510
it's a novel,
but it's about this,

350
00:15:02,511 --> 00:15:03,650
uh,
these two guys.

351
00:15:03,651 --> 00:15:04,484
Oh,
Tom Waits is one of the actors in the 

352
00:15:06,231 --> 00:15:07,940
play pilots.
They're like smugglers,

353
00:15:07,941 --> 00:15:08,774
whatever.
And they get hired to go in and bomb 

354
00:15:11,121 --> 00:15:11,954
this uncontacted tribe before the 
missionaries make contact with them 

355
00:15:15,921 --> 00:15:16,754
because once they are contacted then all
their land gets set aside as a reserve 

356
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:24,140
and this corrupt politician wants to log
in and mine and you know,

357
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:24,993
all the shit.
So he hires these two ne'er do wells to 

358
00:15:26,871 --> 00:15:28,590
go in and bomb them.
Well,

359
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:29,730
and uh,
I mean,

360
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:32,330
I'm not ruining the story.
This is like the first 20 pages.

361
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:35,180
You get the setup and what happens is 
they,

362
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,261
they,
uh,

363
00:15:36,261 --> 00:15:38,900
they go out and they sort of fly over 
the first day and they see,

364
00:15:38,901 --> 00:15:39,734
they see the clearing in the jungle and 
all the Indians run into the jungle and 

365
00:15:43,821 --> 00:15:45,140
then they're sort of flying low.

366
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:45,973
There may be a thousand feet up and this
one warrior runs into the clearing and 

367
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:49,933
fires an Arrow at the airplane and 
they're laughing like this fucking guy 

368
00:15:53,001 --> 00:15:55,100
thinks he's going to shoot down an 
airplane with an Arrow,

369
00:15:55,101 --> 00:15:55,934
you know,
and they go back to the village and one 

370
00:15:57,231 --> 00:15:58,064
of the pilots,
it's Tom Waits and I'm forget the other 

371
00:16:00,531 --> 00:16:01,364
actor,
but he plays a Navajo and they're like 

372
00:16:02,841 --> 00:16:05,870
Vietnam vets bombing around South 
America with their plane,

373
00:16:05,871 --> 00:16:06,704
right?
And they're back in the village and I 

374
00:16:09,391 --> 00:16:12,140
get shit faced.
And then the Tom waits character goes to

375
00:16:12,141 --> 00:16:12,974
bed and the other guy's still hanging 
out in this little bar and somebody 

376
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:17,270
slips him.
Some IOWASCA.

377
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,630
And so he's already drunk.
He drinks this Iowasca heats,

378
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,920
like,
starts hallucinating.

379
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,780
He goes out,
gets in the airplane,

380
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:26,810
flies off in the air in the middle of 
the night,

381
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:30,770
flies out to this spot in the jungle 
where they saw where they're supposed to

382
00:16:30,771 --> 00:16:31,970
bomb them that day.

383
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:35,420
Instead he puts on a parachute,
ditches the plane,

384
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:38,000
jumps out.
Oh my lands in the jungle,

385
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,730
takes off all his clothes and his 
pistol,

386
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:45,760
buries it in the jungle and then walks 
naked into the village to spoiler alert.

387
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:48,891
No,
no.

388
00:16:48,891 --> 00:16:51,230
That's the beginning of the movie 
beginning.

389
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,093
Hold on a second.
I'm writing this down as young as he 

390
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:55,873
sexy bitch.
Look at them.

391
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:58,250
Yeah.
And what was this?

392
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,790
The film 90.
Wow.

393
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:05,290
I was fresh out of John Lithgow.
Yeah.

394
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,530
Yeah.
Um,

395
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:07,760
anyway,
that's,

396
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:10,280
that's how it begins.
Peter Matheson's a great writer.

397
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:12,920
He uh,
he was a hard hardcore dude.

398
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:15,440
Real bad ass guy.
But anyway,

399
00:17:15,441 --> 00:17:16,880
um,
that's how it starts.

400
00:17:16,881 --> 00:17:19,220
So,
so this guy literally goes back in time,

401
00:17:19,221 --> 00:17:20,054
right?
Because he's a Navajo and when he saw 

402
00:17:20,931 --> 00:17:21,764
that guy shoot the Arrow,
he sort of had this vision of how his 

403
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:29,210
people had lost their dignity and their 
culture had been destroyed.

404
00:17:29,211 --> 00:17:30,044
And if only they had known what they 
were facing and these people in the 

405
00:17:32,121 --> 00:17:34,820
jungle,
I have no idea what's coming for them.

406
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:35,654
Right.
And so his mission is I'm going to go 

407
00:17:36,861 --> 00:17:40,130
back and save them because I can tell 
them what's coming.

408
00:17:40,131 --> 00:17:41,010
I can,
you know,

409
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:44,300
move through worlds.
I can move back in time and it's fucking

410
00:17:44,301 --> 00:17:46,130
wild.
What a great plot.

411
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:50,010
Jesus Christ high right now.
Scaring

412
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:54,090
the shit out of me.
So La Man,

413
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:55,950
I'm back in La.
What happened?

414
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:57,570
I thought you were going to be an ex.
Pat.

415
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,720
You're going to fucking get out of here 
before the big one landed a.

416
00:17:59,721 --> 00:18:01,280
yeah,
I'm still,

417
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,333
I'm watching.
I'm watching very closely at all before 

418
00:18:04,831 --> 00:18:07,230
they close the door.
I'm gonna I gotta weigh out.

419
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,213
What's it like coming back right at the 
time when Donald Trump becomes 

420
00:18:10,321 --> 00:18:11,820
president?
It's an adventure,

421
00:18:11,821 --> 00:18:13,440
Huh?
It's strange.

422
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:14,543
The.
I feel like I was saying this on my 

423
00:18:15,811 --> 00:18:18,660
podcast the other day.
I feel like the like,

424
00:18:18,661 --> 00:18:22,890
you know how the solar system is moving,
you know the whole galaxy is moving.

425
00:18:22,891 --> 00:18:26,130
So there are all these zones.
I gotta be careful,

426
00:18:26,131 --> 00:18:28,190
man.
I'm talking about don't be countered.

427
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:30,450
Don't be careful.
There's no need to be careful.

428
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:33,870
Think about Tom Waits.
Is it Tom Waits?

429
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,180
Is that the name of the actor?
No,

430
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:37,800
that's the center.
Tom Waits and Tom Barrett.

431
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,040
He's the same guy.
The same guy.

432
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:42,773
Okay.
And then Tom Berenger who was in saving 

433
00:18:44,971 --> 00:18:45,810
private Ryan,
right.

434
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:46,883
Or platoon platoon.
He was the bad guy and platoon with a 

435
00:18:48,751 --> 00:18:50,710
scar on his face and I think so,
yeah,

436
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,593
it was great.

437
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,950
Speaking of mediators,
did you guys see this in Michigan at the

438
00:18:55,951 --> 00:18:56,640
other day?
Yeah,

439
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,260
I did.
Yeah.

440
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,253
A giant fucking hunk of metal from the 
sky slammed into a or something from 

441
00:19:02,821 --> 00:19:05,040
this guy slammed into Lake Michigan.
Look at that.

442
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,510
That might've actually burned out before
it hit the ground.

443
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:11,263
So you see it like kind of fizzle and 
towards the end it's amazing what the 

444
00:19:13,741 --> 00:19:14,574
atmosphere does.
Just things coming through the 

445
00:19:16,261 --> 00:19:17,094
atmosphere.
Like remember when the space shuttle 

446
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:21,540
lost some tiles and then burned out in 
the atmosphere.

447
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:22,843
I'm good Jim.
It's just amazing that our air just 

448
00:19:26,341 --> 00:19:29,190
traveling through the air at a high rate
of speed destroys things.

449
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,350
It just rips them apart,
you know,

450
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,990
burns him up.
Yeah.

451
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,340
Well,
the,

452
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:36,243
the threat of the impact for something 
that's in space is ever looming and 

453
00:19:41,701 --> 00:19:42,534
always ignored mean we rarely think 
about it until something like this 

454
00:19:45,301 --> 00:19:48,660
happens and I think it's just so scary 
that there's part of our brain that just

455
00:19:48,661 --> 00:19:49,200
puts it off.

456
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,940
We just go.
Yeah,

457
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,030
and then move on to the next thing.
Nothing you could do about it.

458
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:55,163
It's definitely going to happen.
It's happened before you look up at the 

459
00:19:57,781 --> 00:19:58,614
moon.
There's an amazing video that Neil 

460
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:01,074
degrasse Tyson posted on his instagram 
page the other day and it's a guy using 

461
00:20:04,681 --> 00:20:08,400
a camera and he has some incredible lens
on it.

462
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:11,370
Oh yeah,
I saw that.

463
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:13,840
And you,
you,

464
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:17,760
you mean he's got a really good camera 
and you get really cool by the way,

465
00:20:17,761 --> 00:20:20,850
that might not be nailed to God.
The grass Tyson's actual page.

466
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:21,953
I think it might be like a fan page 
because it links up to twitter and the 

467
00:20:26,761 --> 00:20:27,594
twitter is Neil degrasse Tyson fan,
so it might not be his real instagram 

468
00:20:30,751 --> 00:20:31,281
page.
Well,

469
00:20:31,281 --> 00:20:32,114
whatever.
It's an awesome video and it gets to a 

470
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:38,580
really close up when it gets really 
close up.

471
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:42,040
The thing you see is just craters 
everywhere.

472
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:44,160
Well,
there's no atmosphere to protect them.

473
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,530
Exactly.
But then what?

474
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,180
Drop the charges dropped

475
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,010
and then you start thinking about how 
much shit is out there.

476
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:56,320
Like that thing is just covered.
It's just covered with but time.

477
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,040
Think about how long it's been out there
to.

478
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:00,874
You know,
I'm the one I'm worried about is the 

479
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,940
solar flare.
Oh yeah.

480
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:06,760
You know because that was it like 1880 
or something.

481
00:21:06,761 --> 00:21:07,594
There was a big one in North America and
it melted out the transmission cables 

482
00:21:10,691 --> 00:21:15,160
for the claymores cohorts code guys the 
Telegraph.

483
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,970
So when that hits,
like all our computers are gone now,

484
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,220
computers are our grid.
Yeah.

485
00:21:21,221 --> 00:21:24,310
The transformers are out.
So they're saying if something like that

486
00:21:24,311 --> 00:21:25,144
does happen and you can never predict if
or when it would take months to get 

487
00:21:28,901 --> 00:21:30,490
power back up.
Yeah.

488
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,880
And people live in Phoenix in August,
they're fucked.

489
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:34,773
Yeah.
I mean [inaudible] you live in a cold 

490
00:21:36,821 --> 00:21:38,860
place,
at least you could burn wood.

491
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,810
I mean,
people did that for a long time.

492
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:41,703
They figured out fire.
There was actually an article recently 

493
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:45,543
about neanderthals and they're trying to
figure out when there's still a debate 

494
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:49,893
as to whether or not they actually knew 
how to make fire or whether they knew 

495
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:55,890
how to keep it lit or once they found it
right,

496
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:56,913
you know that they would find it.
It would be like the sacred fire and 

497
00:21:58,331 --> 00:21:59,164
they would keep it lit,
but they weren't quite smart enough to 

498
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:01,203
actually make it,
but now they're thinking that might not 

499
00:22:02,891 --> 00:22:03,724
be the case.
They might have had a lot of debate on 

500
00:22:05,201 --> 00:22:06,034
that.
Yeah.

501
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,220
You studied a lot of ancient 
civilizations.

502
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,520
How much,
how much debate is there?

503
00:22:12,521 --> 00:22:15,910
Like whenever I hear someone say people 
definitely did this.

504
00:22:15,911 --> 00:22:18,010
They definitely did that.
You know,

505
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:18,873
like when they're looking back at 
evidence like as far as far as like who 

506
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:22,900
could handle fire?

507
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:25,150
Like who was the first people in,
when did they figure it out,

508
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:27,730
how do they put all that shit together?
Well,

509
00:22:27,731 --> 00:22:30,650
I mean it depends on the specific case.
Right.

510
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,600
With in the case of fire with they're 
looking at is uh,

511
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:37,810
and,
and also because it's so,

512
00:22:37,811 --> 00:22:40,840
there's such a scarcity of evidence.
Things change really quickly,

513
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:42,580
right?
Like for a long time,

514
00:22:42,581 --> 00:22:43,414
they thought people crossed over,
the first few North Americans are about 

515
00:22:46,421 --> 00:22:48,460
10,000
years ago and now they're saying,

516
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:49,870
oh,
at least 14.

517
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:53,740
And now they're finding places in Chile 
what appear to be 40,000

518
00:22:53,741 --> 00:22:54,574
and other union,
they came over in boats and there were 

519
00:22:55,811 --> 00:22:57,340
several different,
you know,

520
00:22:57,370 --> 00:22:58,203
groups that came in different ways.
So there's a lot of change in that 

521
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:04,420
because there's so little evidence that 
when a new piece comes in,

522
00:23:04,421 --> 00:23:07,690
it really radically transformed things.
But with fire,

523
00:23:07,691 --> 00:23:10,040
what they're looking at is,
um,

524
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:13,300
evidence of fire concurrent with human 
habitation.

525
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:14,163
So with carbon dating,
you can figure out the age of the coals 

526
00:23:17,831 --> 00:23:21,310
or the stuff that's left in the ash.
Um,

527
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:25,360
and then you'd look at pieces of bone or
something that they were cooking.

528
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,930
And if you get the same area then you 
can figure,

529
00:23:28,931 --> 00:23:29,680
okay,
they were,

530
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,513
this wasn't a fire 10,000
years after somebody ate a rat here or 

531
00:23:33,191 --> 00:23:34,700
something.
Right there cooking yet,

532
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,540
especially if the bones show charring as
well,

533
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:38,374
then they're cooking the food,
but that's just in the last 15 or 20 

534
00:23:41,591 --> 00:23:42,424
years.
The estimate of human use of fire has 

535
00:23:44,801 --> 00:23:45,980
gone from like

536
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:48,740
500,000
years to a million.

537
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,320
Isn't that crazy?
They just keep back dating things.

538
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,260
Yeah,
so fascinating.

539
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:55,123
Just to those mounds they found in the 
Amazon really recently they used drones 

540
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:00,913
and they were getting these photographs,
drones or satellites or getting these 

541
00:24:03,261 --> 00:24:04,094
images from space from,
from above rather show like grids and 

542
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:08,653
they show all these.
These structures that they previously 

543
00:24:11,181 --> 00:24:12,830
had never recognized.
Didn't notice.

544
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:16,220
Some of them look like stonehenge in the
same sort of shape.

545
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:17,054
Apparently.
There's like irrigation canals and 

546
00:24:19,071 --> 00:24:19,810
stuff.
Yeah.

547
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:22,130
Yeah.
They have no idea who,

548
00:24:22,131 --> 00:24:23,120
uh,
what's this?

549
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,230
Yeah.
I have this idea it.

550
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:30,230
I have a lot of.
I need like a bunch of graduate students

551
00:24:30,231 --> 00:24:31,064
because I have ideas for books,
but I never get around to writing the 

552
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,920
story of my life should be like,
I need a stat.

553
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:38,870
You should be like a guy who tells it 
like,

554
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,370
people,
we need to work on this.

555
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:45,610
If you're curious but you're not 
disciplined or you don't have the time,

556
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:47,690
honestly,
ideas,

557
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,630
but in between doing your podcast,
writing your book and live in your life,

558
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,730
how much time do you have left?
Live in my life.

559
00:24:52,731 --> 00:24:54,410
Takes up a lot of time.
You,

560
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:57,230
I appreciate that about you.
I really do.

561
00:24:57,231 --> 00:24:58,610
I appreciate that.
You,

562
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:02,390
uh,
you have a very um,

563
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:03,943
very.
It's an intelligent but it's an honest 

564
00:25:06,681 --> 00:25:09,770
way of looking at time.
You know,

565
00:25:09,771 --> 00:25:10,604
you don't have like this overwhelming 
ambition and you don't have like this 

566
00:25:14,571 --> 00:25:17,630
overwhelming desire to be recognized or 
anything like that,

567
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,793
but you do have an overwhelming desire 
to have fun and be comfortable and be 

568
00:25:23,001 --> 00:25:23,834
curious.
So you're saying I'm a lazy fucking 

569
00:25:25,071 --> 00:25:26,760
hippies.
Were you?

570
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:29,330
You're having a good time.
I think you might be doing it right.

571
00:25:29,331 --> 00:25:31,280
I get all the people that I know that 
are super smart.

572
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:33,650
You like the least stress.
Super Smart Dude.

573
00:25:33,651 --> 00:25:34,310
I know.
Oh,

574
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:35,810
thank you.
I appreciate that.

575
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:38,750
I quote you on that,
on my next book,

576
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:42,020
but man,
I mean considering you're always around,

577
00:25:42,021 --> 00:25:43,820
you always enjoy in different parts of 
the world.

578
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:45,043
You're always coming back with these 
crazy stories and interesting 

579
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:48,043
perspectives are you gathered up,
but you don't seem stressed and so many 

580
00:25:52,581 --> 00:25:53,414
people that I know that are like in your
intellectual realm are fucking freaking 

581
00:25:57,651 --> 00:26:00,210
out all the time.
To me.

582
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:02,570
I mean,
if I'm stressed,

583
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,180
it's.
I get stressed by my lack of stress.

584
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:10,700
That's my biggest problem.
I think you're built for podcasts.

585
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,680
I really do.
I think your,

586
00:26:12,681 --> 00:26:15,450
your mind and your curiosity,
it's like you're,

587
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:17,510
you're trapped in this medium.
I mean,

588
00:26:17,511 --> 00:26:19,040
it's not that I don't think your book is
Great.

589
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:22,520
I thought sex at dawn was amazing.
Why do I keep coughing?

590
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:25,670
Is that the weed?
Sex at dawn was amazing,

591
00:26:25,671 --> 00:26:28,030
but uh,
you,

592
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:28,893
you're really well suited for podcasts.
You're really well suited for freeform 

593
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:33,890
conversations.
You can tell you enjoy it,

594
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,331
you know?
And again,

595
00:26:35,331 --> 00:26:37,250
it's not very stressful.
No,

596
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:39,590
that's what I love about it.
I did one last night.

597
00:26:39,591 --> 00:26:41,260
I,
I occasionally do a,

598
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:44,430
what I call a Roma renting out my ass 
episode

599
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:47,570
and it's where it's just me.
No gas.

600
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:48,720
Right?
So last night I did,

601
00:26:48,721 --> 00:26:51,900
when I'm drinking beer,
I'm like reading letters from people and

602
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:52,734
yeah,
and going off on whatever the fuck I'm 

603
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:56,810
going off on and it occurred to me later
like that,

604
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:58,920
you know,
I'm not dealing with the kind of numbers

605
00:26:58,921 --> 00:27:00,330
you're dealing with,
but you know,

606
00:27:00,331 --> 00:27:04,660
I've got a stadium of people listening 
to me fucking stadium,

607
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:10,430
but I am more relaxed than if I were 
talking to a friend on the phone because

608
00:27:11,461 --> 00:27:14,370
I don't see anybody.
I'm just alone drinking a beer,

609
00:27:14,371 --> 00:27:19,230
talking into this microphone and I don't
feel the presence of anyone listening.

610
00:27:19,231 --> 00:27:22,680
So I'm totally fucking relaxed sometimes
to my detriment.

611
00:27:22,681 --> 00:27:23,514
I probably say things I shouldn't say 
and share shit that I've meant to keep 

612
00:27:26,671 --> 00:27:28,800
private or whatever.
But it's,

613
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:29,693
it is a weird thing.
I mean Jamie and I were talking about 

614
00:27:32,431 --> 00:27:35,640
this earlier,
like when you said,

615
00:27:35,641 --> 00:27:36,280
Hey Chris,
you,

616
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,140
it's been awhile to come.

617
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,120
This is like,
yeah,

618
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:39,540
I'm going to go hang out with my buddy 
joe.

619
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:40,733
Yeah.
But there are a fucking million people 

620
00:27:42,151 --> 00:27:45,120
hovering around here listening to us.
You know,

621
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:45,954
it's really weird,
like 90 percent of my friendship with 

622
00:27:48,211 --> 00:27:50,580
you has taken place here.
I know,

623
00:27:50,581 --> 00:27:51,750
right?
It's so.

624
00:27:51,751 --> 00:27:55,530
And it's the same worries,
the same Moshe Kasher.

625
00:27:55,531 --> 00:27:58,590
I've got all these friends who I only 
see when we're on a fucking mind,

626
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:02,070
you know,
it's really interesting is Duncan and I,

627
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,113
we were having a really hard time 
spending time together because he's 

628
00:28:05,911 --> 00:28:08,190
always busy.
We'd have a really hard time with only a

629
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:09,023
few times we got together and just hung 
out as friends over the last couple of 

630
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:15,210
years,
but we did so many podcasts together for

631
00:28:15,211 --> 00:28:16,044
that and we'd have these conversations.
Like one of the things that's unique 

632
00:28:19,021 --> 00:28:19,854
about this form is that you have these 
conversations that are like so isolated 

633
00:28:24,511 --> 00:28:27,450
from any distraction and I don't think 
that exists anywhere else anymore.

634
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:29,250
Good point.
Just to people looking at you.

635
00:28:29,251 --> 00:28:31,080
That's why I don't like when people look
at their phones.

636
00:28:31,081 --> 00:28:33,660
I don't like when people like bring a 
laptop or something like that.

637
00:28:33,661 --> 00:28:34,494
It's like,
man,

638
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:37,350
I try to close mine now.
I used to not.

639
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,150
I used to look at it.
It's not smart.

640
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:40,403
The smart thing to do is just put it 
down and this form of conversation that 

641
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:47,690
collect the kind of like I would 
encourage people to have podcasts,

642
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:49,970
have their own podcast,
not even if they want to read,

643
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:51,240
they don't.
You don't even have to release it,

644
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:54,480
but by doing it,
but just the act of doing it,

645
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:56,340
you're,
you're having these conversations,

646
00:28:56,341 --> 00:28:59,510
these extended conversations with people
and I think it,

647
00:28:59,511 --> 00:29:04,350
it exercises your thought process in a 
way and the engagement process.

648
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,720
It focuses your mind.
People used to say,

649
00:29:06,721 --> 00:29:09,990
some famous writer said,
I write to see what I think,

650
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,350
you know.

651
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:14,490
I think podcasting sort of the same.
The way you're describing it,

652
00:29:14,491 --> 00:29:15,324
it's true.
It's,

653
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:19,080
it's one place where we turn off all the
distractions and just focus.

654
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,650
I,
my plan now is to get a van.

655
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,633
I want to get a sprinter van and like 
put a bed in it and a little kitchen 

656
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:28,620
with the country,
travel the country doing podcasts.

657
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:30,090
Ooh,
that's a great idea.

658
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:31,163
And I had this other idea because 
because I see you've got enough weight 

659
00:29:33,961 --> 00:29:37,620
that people will come to you,
but I don't want to do shit on skype and

660
00:29:37,621 --> 00:29:39,420
phone and I hate.
I hate that.

661
00:29:39,421 --> 00:29:40,201
Yeah.
It feels weird,

662
00:29:40,201 --> 00:29:40,930
right?
Yeah.

663
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:42,070
There's delays

664
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:45,280
and you're talking over each other and 
you can't see the body language.

665
00:29:45,281 --> 00:29:46,114
You don't know if they're disengaging 
from what you're talking about or 

666
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:50,580
they're getting uncomfortable.
Maybe you're getting too personal,

667
00:29:50,581 --> 00:29:51,414
you know,
I really like being in a room with 

668
00:29:52,871 --> 00:29:54,370
somebody.
Also,

669
00:29:54,371 --> 00:29:57,320
the kind of people that I have on my 
podcast are like,

670
00:29:57,321 --> 00:29:58,780
you,
they're people you want to know.

671
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:00,400
They're interesting.
Fucking people,

672
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:01,263
you know.
So I want to like hang out and meet 

673
00:30:03,311 --> 00:30:04,144
their friends and meet the husband or 
the wife and the kids and sit in the 

674
00:30:07,121 --> 00:30:09,910
driveway in my van for a few days and 
get to know the crowd.

675
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:12,440
And I was thinking I'd love to meet.
Um,

676
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:14,410
what's his name?
Dan In bisbee.

677
00:30:14,411 --> 00:30:15,420
Your buddy.
Uh,

678
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:17,750
that Santa Get up.
I'd love to.

679
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:19,960
And Bimbo.
Bimbo.

680
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:23,260
Bingo.
Yeah,

681
00:30:23,261 --> 00:30:24,730
you can love them.
My Buddy,

682
00:30:24,731 --> 00:30:26,910
uh,
Jake Johansen.

683
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:29,830
Do Comedians Love Jake?
Jake's green guy,

684
00:30:29,831 --> 00:30:30,664
so I was at his house and he,
we were talking about how comics think 

685
00:30:33,251 --> 00:30:36,430
differently because I was like,
I love hanging out with you guys because

686
00:30:36,431 --> 00:30:39,460
nobody gets offended about anything.
You can just say whatever the fuck comes

687
00:30:39,461 --> 00:30:41,070
out of your head out of your mind.
Right.

688
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:42,663
And he was like,
we were talking about podcasts and I 

689
00:30:44,021 --> 00:30:45,910
said something about Stan Hope,
and he's like,

690
00:30:45,911 --> 00:30:46,744
dude,
you gotta listen to the cliffhanger 

691
00:30:48,431 --> 00:30:50,710
episodes.
Have you heard those?

692
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:51,573
Know?

693
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,800
What did he do?
Oh my God,

694
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:57,883
there it was like three years ago,
I went back into the archives and 

695
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:01,503
archives and found them.
He had this thing where he has this 

696
00:31:04,691 --> 00:31:05,524
couple living in the house in the 
backyard and like they'd met by chance 

697
00:31:10,241 --> 00:31:11,074
and then it turned out that he had 
fucked the woman 15 years earlier after 

698
00:31:14,951 --> 00:31:15,784
a gig in Reno or something.
And so now she's with her boyfriend and 

699
00:31:19,121 --> 00:31:23,350
they're living in the backyard and 
they're all buddies and the four of them

700
00:31:23,351 --> 00:31:24,184
are all the two couples I guess had a 
sexual thing and it was all cool and it 

701
00:31:28,631 --> 00:31:29,464
was just really beautiful.
And they're talking about how they met 

702
00:31:31,481 --> 00:31:33,160
in the history of the relationship and 
all that.

703
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,500
The boyfriends there,
the girlfriend's not there.

704
00:31:35,501 --> 00:31:36,334
It turns out the girlfriends in the 
hospital about to have open heart 

705
00:31:39,281 --> 00:31:40,630
surgery.
That was the cliffhanger.

706
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:43,210
Holy Shit.
So at the end of this hour and a half,

707
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:46,540
two hour conversation where they're 
talking about this,

708
00:31:46,541 --> 00:31:49,420
you know,
this relationship with it turns out like

709
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:51,970
she's going to have open heart surgery.
She might be dead.

710
00:31:51,971 --> 00:31:56,260
Folks tune in next week to find out if 
she's dead and they're laughing,

711
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:59,650
but they're laughing and this was jake's
point.

712
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:05,610
They're processing grief through 
laughter and that there is nothing new.

713
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:10,990
And they're not denying how intense and 
sad and scared they are.

714
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,990
But they're still laughing,
isn't it?

715
00:32:13,991 --> 00:32:14,824
Finally grief over death is one of the 
few things where we demand you behave a 

716
00:32:19,541 --> 00:32:20,710
certain way.
Well,

717
00:32:20,711 --> 00:32:23,470
they're Irish wakes right where 
everybody gets drunk and laughs.

718
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:26,560
Yeah.
But Intel's crazy body stories about the

719
00:32:26,561 --> 00:32:29,020
dead guy.
That's how you celebrate the life.

720
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,970
Hm.
That's a good way.

721
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:32,710
Yeah.
I think it's a very.

722
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:36,820
This imposed sadness,
this sort of seriousness.

723
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:39,530
I think he's very sort of Protestant.
Yeah,

724
00:32:39,531 --> 00:32:40,030
there's,
there's

725
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:41,240
a little bit of that,
but there's also,

726
00:32:41,241 --> 00:32:44,090
I think we want to know who feels bad,
you know,

727
00:32:44,091 --> 00:32:46,250
because if you don't feel bad like 
tribally,

728
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:48,740
I think that's a very dangerous person 
to have around.

729
00:32:48,741 --> 00:32:51,900
Like say if you die,
it's like a psychopath or something.

730
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:52,783
Yeah.
I really think that might be something 

731
00:32:53,541 --> 00:32:56,300
to that.
Like we might enforce it and there might

732
00:32:56,301 --> 00:32:57,134
be like this urge and instinct to 
enforce extreme grief because we feel 

733
00:33:01,491 --> 00:33:05,480
like people who,
who don't feel that are either not on my

734
00:33:05,481 --> 00:33:08,960
team really didn't care about the person
that I cared about or might be a psycho.

735
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,180
Right.
Interestingly,

736
00:33:11,181 --> 00:33:15,650
some cultures have professional mourners
like greet you,

737
00:33:15,651 --> 00:33:17,500
how chip Pan,
you know,

738
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:20,500
you pay him to come to the funeral and 
they'll,

739
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:21,343
we'll and scream and cry and express the
emotion so the other people can just 

740
00:33:25,521 --> 00:33:27,650
sort of chill and wow,
you know,

741
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:28,550
go to the buffet.

742
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:32,300
Did you see after Kim Jong,
Il,

743
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,433
Kim Jong Il died in North Korea,
that people were being punished because 

744
00:33:35,991 --> 00:33:36,824
they didn't mourn hard enough.
They got six month jail sentences 

745
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:45,050
because they didn't mourn hard enough 
and they were just the worst fake acting

746
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:45,913
like all throughout the streets and 
they're filming it for their propaganda 

747
00:33:48,021 --> 00:33:49,370
films,
but it's like,

748
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:51,860
see if he could pull some of it up.
It's kind of hilarious.

749
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:52,903
It's hilarious and terrifying.
North Korea terrifies me and one of the 

750
00:33:56,901 --> 00:33:57,734
things that terrifies me the most about 
it is that it is in our face everyday 

751
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:06,320
direct evidence that things could go 
terribly wrong at any point in time with

752
00:34:06,321 --> 00:34:07,154
human beings and we got so fucking lucky
that we're born who at wherever you are 

753
00:34:13,221 --> 00:34:14,054
that you can listen to this and not have
to worry about being locked up for 

754
00:34:15,381 --> 00:34:16,214
possessing it,
whether it's in England or Norway or 

755
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,300
Canada or wherever you're listening to 
this.

756
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,133
We got sold lucky.
You could've easily been bored in North 

757
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:25,603
Korea.
Any of us can be born in a prison in 

758
00:34:26,871 --> 00:34:27,704
North Korea where you're born as a 
prisoner and you'll die as a prisoner 

759
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:34,160
and that's going on right now.
In 2017,

760
00:34:34,161 --> 00:34:34,994
there is a fucking military dictatorship
and they're killing people and 

761
00:34:38,361 --> 00:34:42,050
imprisoning people.
And the lights are off at night when you

762
00:34:42,051 --> 00:34:44,690
fly over it and they take satellite 
footage of it.

763
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:48,110
You see the lights are all off like 
these people wailing on the street.

764
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:54,360
Immediate is fucking Uber Bizarre there.
They're all on their knees.

765
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:58,250
Whaling,
but not a god damn tier to be seen.

766
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:01,460
They're just throwing their.
I mean,

767
00:35:01,461 --> 00:35:04,670
they're probably scared to that they're 
going to be beaten if they don't.

768
00:35:04,671 --> 00:35:06,500
Well hard enough.
So they're scared of that.

769
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,420
Oh,
that'll make you curse is the emotion.

770
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:09,703
But this is,
this is unbelievable that human beings 

771
00:35:11,841 --> 00:35:12,674
no different than us.
There's no difference between them and 

772
00:35:14,361 --> 00:35:15,800
us.
They're just there.

773
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,200
Yeah.
That guy could be your neighbor.

774
00:35:18,201 --> 00:35:20,420
Like one of those people wailing could 
be,

775
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,380
you know,
Francis,

776
00:35:21,381 --> 00:35:22,970
your neighbor,
and you could be this awesome guy.

777
00:35:22,971 --> 00:35:23,511
Like,
dude,

778
00:35:23,511 --> 00:35:25,130
what's up man?
How are you?

779
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:26,330
Oh,
everything's good.

780
00:35:26,331 --> 00:35:26,871
You know,
blah,

781
00:35:26,871 --> 00:35:27,290
blah,
blah.

782
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:29,210
Same Guy.
Could be the same guy,

783
00:35:29,211 --> 00:35:31,400
just got born and a better,
better spot.

784
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:33,440
These are all women.
Oddly enough,

785
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:36,110
this is all women whaling.
Oh,

786
00:35:36,111 --> 00:35:37,980
there's some men that they have to 
separate

787
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:38,813
so they don't fuck with it.
You don't want any fucking monkey 

788
00:35:41,941 --> 00:35:44,340
business while you screaming,
look at these guys crying,

789
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:46,180
looking at,
uh,

790
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,980
it's so strange,
so strange,

791
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:55,080
but this is happening today,
so I understand this a different part of

792
00:35:55,081 --> 00:35:56,210
the world,
but you got to,

793
00:35:56,550 --> 00:36:01,550
we have to all recognize that it's just 
dumb luck that we were born here because

794
00:36:02,011 --> 00:36:02,844
there's these systems that exist 
whenever you have gigantic groups of 

795
00:36:06,871 --> 00:36:10,380
people that are at least fairly isolated
and these systems,

796
00:36:10,381 --> 00:36:11,920
these operating systems,
they,

797
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:12,763
they,
they get enforced and it doesn't matter 

798
00:36:15,091 --> 00:36:16,860
where they are.
Once they get enforced,

799
00:36:16,861 --> 00:36:21,861
they're super difficult to break like 
those surrey women who cut their lip and

800
00:36:22,411 --> 00:36:26,040
stick those plates in them and stretch 
their lips out and do like,

801
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:29,760
that's a part of a system that exists in
that area.

802
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:33,540
And that system is the women are trying 
to get away from it now.

803
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,910
And a lot of women are like,
I don't want to slobber all the time.

804
00:36:35,911 --> 00:36:39,400
I don't want to knock my teeth out to 
put some fucking stupid plate in this.

805
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:42,070
I heard of a tribe where women,
um,

806
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:45,540
laser the hair off their pussies.
Oh,

807
00:36:45,541 --> 00:36:46,374
I heard about that when sometimes they 
wax it right and the usage of shade it 

808
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:55,380
and they were the shoes with like a big 
stick in the back so they can't walk.

809
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,870
Yeah,
it's incredible.

810
00:36:56,970 --> 00:37:01,080
The things people will do in the women 
wear these like really short skirts.

811
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:02,483
I described like Megan Kelly's outfit 
and my bit was a bit I'm working on 

812
00:37:05,071 --> 00:37:07,380
right now that I talk about what she's 
wearing.

813
00:37:07,381 --> 00:37:11,310
It's basically a vagina curtain.
I saw your bit the other night.

814
00:37:11,311 --> 00:37:16,050
That literally is what it is.
It's just these beautiful women on TV,

815
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:17,183
on the news,
and they were wearing something that 

816
00:37:18,191 --> 00:37:18,600
just.

817
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,433
There's,
you know of could lift that up and fuck 

818
00:37:21,431 --> 00:37:22,470
her with it.
That's part of the.

819
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,710
That's part of the skirt is lift.
That's the whole point of it.

820
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:28,740
That's why that fatal attraction scene 
with Susan,

821
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:31,490
what was in it and that Susan Sharon,
Sharon stone,

822
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:35,340
it was so impactful because we've all 
imagined that a million times,

823
00:37:35,341 --> 00:37:36,340
you know?
Yeah,

824
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,430
yeah.
Know she did.

825
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:41,240
Look at that.
Kick the fuck out of dodge.

826
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,470
If she didn't have that clipboard,
they're blocking the light.

827
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,320
The glorious light.
Look at this.

828
00:37:48,321 --> 00:37:49,740
This is crazy,
man.

829
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,570
That's crazy.
That's a crazy outfit.

830
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:56,880
That is a sexy outfit and I like her.
I think she's very smart.

831
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:58,043
Very interesting woman and I'm,
I'm curious to see what happens to her 

832
00:38:00,511 --> 00:38:01,344
now that she's at NBC.
Maybe she'll come on the Joe Rogan 

833
00:38:03,151 --> 00:38:03,984
experience.
I don't want it to be cross from around 

834
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:07,080
stammer stammer a pan.

835
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:09,990
You can do it from a remote location.
We have to do that one by skype.

836
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:13,220
I don't be calling me and I guess I 
could handle it.

837
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:14,083
I can do it.
I have a thing for ice princesses as 

838
00:38:15,541 --> 00:38:19,730
long as I said Hi.
Do you like the Ice Princess?

839
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,940
Something about me that uh,
I think that I like are very powerful,

840
00:38:23,941 --> 00:38:25,620
articulate woman like that.
It's very,

841
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:27,130
very exciting.
We'll see.

842
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:27,841
[inaudible].
That's it.

843
00:38:27,841 --> 00:38:28,674
You're the opposite of me.
You were saying I'm like the stress 

844
00:38:31,051 --> 00:38:32,100
free.
You kinda got your,

845
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:34,950
all about the challenge.
Only something I'm not like,

846
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:36,070
I'm not trying to fuck her or anything

847
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:36,440
like that.
I like,

848
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,690
not that,
that kind of challenge,

849
00:38:37,691 --> 00:38:40,540
but I am fascinated that you came here 
from working out.

850
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:41,380
Yeah,
right.

851
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:43,120
You know,
and then like you,

852
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:44,373
because it's funny you talked about my 
life being like this sort of carefree 

853
00:38:46,721 --> 00:38:48,040
easy going thing.
I think of you,

854
00:38:48,041 --> 00:38:51,280
you're like,
you're like the Martha Stewart of men or

855
00:38:51,281 --> 00:38:53,260
something.
Like you do everything.

856
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:54,123
How do you do you're living like I 
dropped your name occasionally and 

857
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:57,850
someone will be like,
oh,

858
00:38:57,850 --> 00:38:59,190
the podcast guy.
Like,

859
00:38:59,200 --> 00:38:59,890
yeah.
Yeah.

860
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:02,500
And like his friend will go away.
I thought he was the UFC guy.

861
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:03,041
Yeah.
Yeah.

862
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:03,820
That too.
Like,

863
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:04,653
but wait isn't either,
like you have nine lives and you're 

864
00:39:07,091 --> 00:39:08,710
living them all.
How the fuck do you do that?

865
00:39:08,711 --> 00:39:10,540
I don't know.
Your efficiency.

866
00:39:10,541 --> 00:39:12,520
You never sleep.
Plus you're a father,

867
00:39:12,521 --> 00:39:14,530
you're a husband.
I do all that stuff.

868
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,940
I just,
I think it's,

869
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:16,853
it's an illusion that it takes more time
than it does with all the stuff that I 

870
00:39:20,801 --> 00:39:21,270
do.

871
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:23,010
I don't have a job.
Job Chill.

872
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:24,060
Fuck yeah.
Real.

873
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,630
When I watched like documentaries and 
shit,

874
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:28,490
but see that's a chill and that's why I 
can't chill,

875
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,270
chill,
chill.

876
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:33,230
Just like getting your hammock and put 
your hands behind your head and go do,

877
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:33,930
do,
do,

878
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:34,763
do you ever do that?
My brain doesn't work like that so that 

879
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:40,120
my brain's like my day to do something.
Come on,

880
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:42,700
shower.
I love showers.

881
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:45,740
You take long,
like a nice 10 minute hot shower,

882
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,433
pleasure and showers.
Do you have like a good shit in the 

883
00:39:48,941 --> 00:39:53,941
shower and that's your chill time?
I went to Alaska to Prince of Wales.

884
00:39:54,461 --> 00:39:55,780
No.
Yeah,

885
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:57,870
yeah.
Prince of Wales Island and uh,

886
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:58,833
it is this unbelievably wet spot and it 
rains there more than I think anywhere 

887
00:40:04,991 --> 00:40:08,020
else in North America.
It's incredible.

888
00:40:08,021 --> 00:40:10,660
I mean it's just constantly drenched 
with southeast.

889
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:14,350
I don't know.
I don't know where it is geographically.

890
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:15,183
I flew in for this TV show mediator with
my friend Steven Rinella and my friend 

891
00:40:18,461 --> 00:40:21,340
Brian Cowen and Yonis retell us and we 
went to this island.

892
00:40:21,341 --> 00:40:23,470
It was amazing.
It was amazing experience.

893
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:24,723
So beautiful and so remote and so crazy.
And it wasn't even a successful hunting 

894
00:40:27,761 --> 00:40:28,840
trip,
but it was amazing.

895
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:31,840
The experience was amazing,
but one of the most amazing things about

896
00:40:31,841 --> 00:40:32,674
it was that I was wet and uncomfortable 
in this weird sort of environment where 

897
00:40:36,341 --> 00:40:37,174
you never really get dry because it's 
constantly raining for five or six days 

898
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:46,050
and then when I got home I was so happy.
I was so happy.

899
00:40:46,691 --> 00:40:50,350
I was happy in a way that I'd never been
before in a way,

900
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:51,363
during a regular day,
just driving down the street to the 

901
00:40:53,741 --> 00:40:54,574
studio and coming in and hanging out 
with Jamie and doing a podcast and I 

902
00:40:57,641 --> 00:41:00,310
just felt so good.
I felt so good.

903
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:05,140
You felt good to be back or just that?
It wasn't.

904
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,120
I feel good to be back.
It was.

905
00:41:07,121 --> 00:41:07,954
I feel good.
I feel really good and I think that 

906
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:11,883
especially for California,
the weather here is so god damned good 

907
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:16,863
that we have a few days where it rains 
and people literally start to complain 

908
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:20,223
and I'm like,
do you know how crazy it is that you're 

909
00:41:21,611 --> 00:41:26,611
complaining that it rains maybe 10 days 
a year out of 365,

910
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:31,610
and the [inaudible] latest so beautiful 
after they're cleared.

911
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:32,950
Yeah.
It's amazing.

912
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:34,490
There's no bugs.

913
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:35,563
Okay.
I mean this place is so easy to get by 

914
00:41:37,521 --> 00:41:38,354
with.
There's very little wildlife that were 

915
00:41:39,441 --> 00:41:42,680
ever concerned with.
We just live this ideal.

916
00:41:42,681 --> 00:41:45,300
It can idolic what's the word?
Have delicate.

917
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:46,970
A delicate sounds wrong though,
doesn't it?

918
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:49,640
It's not an idol.
It's an ideal.

919
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:53,930
We live a fairytale life for anywhere.
Anyone else anywhere in the world.

920
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:58,790
And I think just coming here from the 
rain soaked island,

921
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:00,800
like as I was driving around,
I was,

922
00:42:00,801 --> 00:42:02,510
I would realize like,
oh,

923
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:03,853
at least for me,
I have to go through some intense 

924
00:42:07,401 --> 00:42:12,350
struggle to appreciate normal existence.
There is no Yang without yen.

925
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:13,213
That's for me for sure.
And there's no comfort without 

926
00:42:15,291 --> 00:42:16,850
discomfort.
So for me,

927
00:42:16,851 --> 00:42:20,240
like for me to be happy and calm and 
like sit here and talk to you.

928
00:42:20,241 --> 00:42:21,074
I,
I all beat the fucking shit out of a 

929
00:42:22,701 --> 00:42:24,440
heavy bag for an hour.

930
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:27,200
So the,
I wish wail on that thing.

931
00:42:27,201 --> 00:42:29,630
I wish I had that hunger.
I that need.

932
00:42:29,631 --> 00:42:33,080
I've got friends like I can't,
I can't relax if I don't run three miles

933
00:42:33,081 --> 00:42:33,980
a day.
Like fuck,

934
00:42:33,981 --> 00:42:36,010
I wish I had that.
I can read.

935
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:38,360
I can get out of bed and go right to the
hammock.

936
00:42:38,361 --> 00:42:40,870
I'm fine.
I don't need to do interval.

937
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,033
It's good.
It's good that you could do that and it 

938
00:42:43,371 --> 00:42:44,210
isn't.
It isn't.

939
00:42:44,211 --> 00:42:45,500
See that's.
I don't get shit done.

940
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:49,100
I need more of that because a,
I'd get more shit done,

941
00:42:49,101 --> 00:42:50,870
but then it's like,
why get shit done?

942
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:51,733
You know,
like what am I trying to get to if I'm 

943
00:42:53,721 --> 00:42:54,730
already there?
It's,

944
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:56,750
that's why I think podcasts are your 
shit.

945
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:59,360
Yeah.
Because effortless.

946
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,233
Just turn it on and do it and maybe like
the way you're doing it with that 

947
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:04,070
ranting.
The Roma one,

948
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:05,440
that's a great idea.

949
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,910
Bill bird does that and it's incredibly 
entertaining.

950
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:09,260
Bill Burrs,
podcasts,

951
00:43:09,261 --> 00:43:11,780
one of the best podcast you'll ever 
listen to and it's always just him.

952
00:43:11,781 --> 00:43:14,750
It was watch when he's on your show.
You guys have a good thing.

953
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:16,310
I love him.
He's amazing.

954
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:19,460
And his new comedy.
Netflix special rather is out now.

955
00:43:19,490 --> 00:43:23,030
It's called a walk your way out.
So right now I haven't seen any yet,

956
00:43:23,031 --> 00:43:23,864
but I saw him do all that material,
so I'm sure it's going to be fucking 

957
00:43:26,001 --> 00:43:26,630
amazing.
Yeah,

958
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:27,680
he's great.
Yeah,

959
00:43:27,681 --> 00:43:28,730
he's,
you know,

960
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:31,500
he's a hard worker to know that guy.
Um,

961
00:43:31,730 --> 00:43:35,420
he works on efforts for family.
He's got his own animated show.

962
00:43:35,450 --> 00:43:37,390
He works on that,
works on Standup,

963
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:39,650
does this podcast twice a week by 
himself.

964
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:42,510
He just had a kid recently,
just had a kid recently.

965
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:45,320
Intense family thing going on,
a lot going on.

966
00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:47,450
Great Guy.
Just a great guy.

967
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:49,053
It is funny.
I mean Jamie and I were talking about 

968
00:43:50,751 --> 00:43:52,490
this earlier,
how like La,

969
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:53,383
I've been here a couple months now so 
I'm sort of getting my head back into 

970
00:43:55,491 --> 00:43:57,860
it.
Everything's the opposite here.

971
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,940
Like even to the point where people 
think like,

972
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:00,980
oh,
you're living in la.

973
00:44:00,981 --> 00:44:01,814
They're picturing Hollywood where you 
live and where I live it's fucking owls 

974
00:44:04,761 --> 00:44:07,700
and coyotes.
It doesn't look like.

975
00:44:07,701 --> 00:44:08,534
Especially if you live where you live is
one of the most awesome spots around 

976
00:44:11,001 --> 00:44:12,050
love.
It's ridiculous.

977
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:15,060
It's like Montana or something crazy.
Yeah,

978
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:17,510
it's beautiful.
So lot of hippies though,

979
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:19,190
a lot of hippies,
but you don't see them.

980
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:20,790
They smell dude,
I was sick,

981
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,660
I was walking,
but there's a lot of fresh air,

982
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:26,450
so they're outdoors.
That's like a dirty dog.

983
00:44:26,451 --> 00:44:28,430
It doesn't offend you.
Don't get that close to.

984
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:30,590
Exactly.
I was uh,

985
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:32,250
I was hiking up in the hills

986
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:36,100
in Topanga couple of weeks ago and I'm 
sitting there on this trail taking,

987
00:44:36,110 --> 00:44:36,943
uh,
taking in the view and I hear these two 

988
00:44:38,131 --> 00:44:40,750
guys coming up the trail and they can't 
see me because there's,

989
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:42,073
you know,
a curve and they're talking and the one 

990
00:44:44,041 --> 00:44:46,680
guy says,
so are you feeling anything yet?

991
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:51,600
And the other guy's like,
well,

992
00:44:51,601 --> 00:44:53,790
my legs feel a little funny,
but you know,

993
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:57,230
either he took Viagra and they're going 
to go to the woods to fuck.

994
00:44:58,210 --> 00:45:00,580
I didn't even occur to me.
I don't know.

995
00:45:00,650 --> 00:45:01,483
I don't know why it occurred to you.
You ready to do this or feel anything 

996
00:45:05,041 --> 00:45:06,430
yet?
He loosening up.

997
00:45:06,650 --> 00:45:07,970
Yeah,
it was a bit that he used to do,

998
00:45:07,971 --> 00:45:08,804
but edibles.
Whereas like the worst thing you could 

999
00:45:10,351 --> 00:45:13,310
ever hear someone say I've taken out of 
hole is I don't feel shit.

1000
00:45:13,311 --> 00:45:14,144
I'm gonna.
Take another one.

1001
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:15,510
I don't do that.

1002
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:17,400
It's always the case,
right?

1003
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:20,070
When people just feel it.
Not really.

1004
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:23,760
We'll go one more fuck it.
And then an hour and a half later you're

1005
00:45:23,761 --> 00:45:25,290
in terror.
Just a deep,

1006
00:45:25,291 --> 00:45:27,630
deep state of terror.
Yeah.

1007
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:29,033
I was called in to consult on a case in 
Spain with a guy that was in a mental 

1008
00:45:32,581 --> 00:45:33,414
hospital and I'm the psychiatrist who 
was treating him was a friend of mine 

1009
00:45:38,851 --> 00:45:42,990
and knew that I took a lot of drugs and 
this guy didn't,

1010
00:45:42,991 --> 00:45:44,550
hadn't taken any drugs,
so he's like,

1011
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:47,970
could you just come in and like talk to 
this guy and see what you think,

1012
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,950
you know.
So I meet with the guy and I'm like,

1013
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:50,960
so what's your story,
man?

1014
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:51,661
He's like,
well look,

1015
00:45:51,661 --> 00:45:56,640
I was in Amsterdam and I ate a Brownie 
and I wasn't feeling anything.

1016
00:45:56,641 --> 00:45:58,880
And so then I took these mushrooms and 
you know.

1017
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:04,300
And next thing I know I woke up,
I was in the jail cell naked.

1018
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:08,333
I started walking down this.
Apparently they told me I was screaming 

1019
00:46:10,801 --> 00:46:12,540
and singing it.
I was like,

1020
00:46:12,541 --> 00:46:14,220
so are you all right man?
He's like,

1021
00:46:14,221 --> 00:46:14,971
yeah,
I'm fine,

1022
00:46:14,971 --> 00:46:17,200
but everyone thinks I'm crazy because of
this thing.

1023
00:46:17,201 --> 00:46:18,034
And it's just like I get.
I keep telling him it's deal like the 

1024
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:24,270
guy from the Tom Berenger mother.
Yeah,

1025
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:27,310
exactly.
So I talked to my.

1026
00:46:27,530 --> 00:46:29,400
Are you guys flying?
The guy's not crazy.

1027
00:46:29,401 --> 00:46:32,460
He just like ate too many fucking 
brownies in Amsterdam.

1028
00:46:32,461 --> 00:46:33,294
It happens to everybody,
but if you eat brownies too many 

1029
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:40,410
brownies and mushrooms together,
but they work together though.

1030
00:46:40,411 --> 00:46:43,110
That's one of the interesting things 
about marijuana and psilocybin.

1031
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:44,183
They're very complimentary.
Like that was what Mckenna used to do 

1032
00:46:46,711 --> 00:46:47,544
when he would take a mushroom trip,
he would eat the mushroom and then he 

1033
00:46:50,471 --> 00:46:54,930
would wait for it to kick in and while 
he was waiting for it to kick in,

1034
00:46:54,931 --> 00:46:55,764
he would roll joints and so he would 
just roll a shitload of joints and then 

1035
00:46:59,161 --> 00:46:59,994
just start smashing the joints and then 
the marijuana would sort of like reach 

1036
00:47:04,441 --> 00:47:05,274
out and grab the silicide that and 
embrace it and just create this tornado 

1037
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:14,250
of awesomeness and that's how we used to
trip and he used to do it by himself.

1038
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:16,800
Mckenna's thing was about silent 
darkness.

1039
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:18,173
Really concerned with experiencing the 
psychedelic state in a very undisturbed 

1040
00:47:24,931 --> 00:47:26,100
manner.
Like to him,

1041
00:47:26,101 --> 00:47:29,980
the idea of taking mushrooms going to 
amusement was insane.

1042
00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:32,560
He had no desire to do anything like 
that.

1043
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:35,590
It just wanted to figure out.
And I think,

1044
00:47:35,591 --> 00:47:36,424
what is the quote?
Each time he would try to see how much 

1045
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:45,940
more he could stand and he would do that
for a while.

1046
00:47:45,941 --> 00:47:48,820
Maybe he was describing another guy when
he's talking about that now that I think

1047
00:47:48,821 --> 00:47:51,540
about it,
but he was a,

1048
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:54,790
like a proponent of five dried grams.
He would.

1049
00:47:54,791 --> 00:47:57,160
He called it heroic dose.
Yeah.

1050
00:47:57,161 --> 00:47:59,500
That fucking heroic dose got me in 
trouble.

1051
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:03,793
I was reading Mckenna and I got this 
acid from a friend of mine that I can't 

1052
00:48:09,171 --> 00:48:10,004
talk about where it came from,
but it was like one of these sources 

1053
00:48:11,541 --> 00:48:12,374
where it's like,
Whoa,

1054
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:15,620
Holy Shit.
Like really from that source.

1055
00:48:15,650 --> 00:48:16,483
Okay.
Right from Albert Hoffman's lab pretty 

1056
00:48:17,761 --> 00:48:18,950
much that kind of thing.
Yeah.

1057
00:48:18,951 --> 00:48:19,970
So,
uh,

1058
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:20,893
[inaudible] like I'm used to be very 
embedded in that world of like 

1059
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:27,230
scientists who were doing hallucinogenic
research and stuff.

1060
00:48:28,010 --> 00:48:29,590
Anyway.
So I,

1061
00:48:29,591 --> 00:48:31,000
I can't tell the whole story,
but I,

1062
00:48:31,001 --> 00:48:34,160
I decided to take a heroic dose because 
it was like,

1063
00:48:34,190 --> 00:48:35,023
Eh,
I'm not going to do a lot more acid in 

1064
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:36,740
my life.
Might as well,

1065
00:48:36,741 --> 00:48:37,574
like go out with a bang,
and I took the stuff and how much you 

1066
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:42,530
take,
whether it was liquid a.

1067
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:45,610
funnily enough,
what happened was I,

1068
00:48:45,710 --> 00:48:48,020
this psychiatrist who was a friend of 
mine,

1069
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:50,930
he hadn't done any drugs since the 
sixties.

1070
00:48:51,530 --> 00:48:52,363
Back in the days when you could order 
acid from Sandoz and they'd send it to 

1071
00:48:55,341 --> 00:48:56,840
you,
Jesus Christ.

1072
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:00,980
How long did that last?
That lasted until it was made illegal in

1073
00:49:00,981 --> 00:49:03,170
64,
something like that.

1074
00:49:03,730 --> 00:49:04,563
I thought it was all.
What didn't lsd go down with that 

1075
00:49:07,151 --> 00:49:10,980
sweeping psychedelic acts of 1970 or 
could've been later.

1076
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:15,520
Was that maybe lsd went down before that
went on afterwards?

1077
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:18,160
I don't know.
There was a bunch of them that were made

1078
00:49:18,161 --> 00:49:20,470
illegal in 70.
Even ones that aren't even

1079
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:22,150
Nixon.
Yeah,

1080
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:23,043
yeah,
yeah,

1081
00:49:23,070 --> 00:49:23,790
yeah.
Well,

1082
00:49:23,790 --> 00:49:25,830
in any case they,
you know,

1083
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:26,673
it was marketed.
LSD was marketed to doctors and two 

1084
00:49:31,501 --> 00:49:32,334
psychiatrists and psychologists who 
would take it in order to experience 

1085
00:49:36,911 --> 00:49:39,930
psychosis so they could better treat 
their patients.

1086
00:49:40,530 --> 00:49:41,363
It was called a psychotomimetic,
so you could just order it and take it 

1087
00:49:45,601 --> 00:49:46,051
and like,
oh,

1088
00:49:46,051 --> 00:49:49,260
this is what it's like to be psychotic 
and understand that,

1089
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:52,440
but you think about,
I mean from a medical perspective,

1090
00:49:52,441 --> 00:49:53,274
think about the nobility of that,
like what a cool doctor and what an 

1091
00:49:57,691 --> 00:49:59,610
interesting time where it was like,
hey,

1092
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:03,420
we all need to experience nine hours of 
insanity,

1093
00:50:03,690 --> 00:50:05,700
so that will be better.
Or psychiatrist.

1094
00:50:05,730 --> 00:50:08,250
That's a pretty fucking cool thing.
That is very cool.

1095
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:09,900
Very cool way of looking at it,
right?

1096
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:10,793
Yeah.
It's a lifeguard who jumps into the 

1097
00:50:11,731 --> 00:50:14,940
water and not a lifeguard who stands on 
the beach and throws you a pill,

1098
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:15,420
you know?

1099
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:16,253
Yeah.
If you talk to a psychiatrist and the 

1100
00:50:17,551 --> 00:50:20,730
psychiatrist doesn't have any 
psychedelic experiences,

1101
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:24,360
you you can understand it because you 
know,

1102
00:50:24,361 --> 00:50:26,700
especially if you're an academic,
you want to be respected.

1103
00:50:26,701 --> 00:50:30,320
Psychedelic experiences for the most 
part are illegal and you know,

1104
00:50:30,321 --> 00:50:31,154
people get weird about it and I can 
understand wanting to keep it under 

1105
00:50:32,871 --> 00:50:33,704
wraps,
but if you're not really interested in 

1106
00:50:35,961 --> 00:50:38,660
it at all,
how much are you studying the mind?

1107
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:44,360
Exactly and you not.
Experiential evidence is invalid.

1108
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:45,260
I mean,
come on.

1109
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:46,093
It's very valid.
We know that there's some extreme 

1110
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:51,950
effects that happen with some very 
potent psychedelics.

1111
00:50:51,951 --> 00:50:53,250
Like,
um,

1112
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,820
uh,
was a sage.

1113
00:50:55,821 --> 00:50:56,730
What is,
what is it called?

1114
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:58,250
What are they called?
Salvia.

1115
00:50:58,251 --> 00:50:59,570
Salvia.
Salvia divinorum,

1116
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:00,830
which is essentially sage,
right?

1117
00:51:00,831 --> 00:51:02,030
Yeah.
That's,

1118
00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:02,983
that stuff will blow your fucking mind.
And that shit was available in head 

1119
00:51:07,251 --> 00:51:08,084
shops just a few years.
One of the most potent psychedelics 

1120
00:51:13,521 --> 00:51:17,030
known to man,
I think it was Ari who had.

1121
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:20,780
He did it and he,
he had a life.

1122
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:25,220
He lived a whole life,
like three years.

1123
00:51:25,221 --> 00:51:27,800
He felt like he lived a life.
He had friends,

1124
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:29,750
he had girlfriends.
He broke up with him.

1125
00:51:29,751 --> 00:51:32,750
He had jobs like the whole deal,
that matrix.

1126
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:33,613
And then he came back and he was only 
gone for like 10 minutes on this couch 

1127
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:39,670
on a Salvia trip.
Do we isolate that?

1128
00:51:39,710 --> 00:51:42,020
A clip?
Is that what you're looking for?

1129
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:43,960
Yeah,
it.

1130
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:47,390
There's a clip of him doing it and then 
he talked about what happened later.

1131
00:51:47,391 --> 00:51:48,750
I think it was with you.
Yeah.

1132
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:52,190
I want to dunk into podcasts,
but here's the clip of him doing it.

1133
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:54,650
Yeah.
Brian's old podcast,

1134
00:51:55,310 --> 00:51:56,143
naughty show,
Sam Tripoli's podcast on Brian's death 

1135
00:51:59,331 --> 00:52:03,140
squad network.
And so he uh,

1136
00:52:03,290 --> 00:52:04,123
res.
So he's gone there and they're all 

1137
00:52:09,471 --> 00:52:10,850
laughing and talking.
Hee Hee,

1138
00:52:10,890 --> 00:52:11,723
ha ha.
Well this guy's trip and his balls off 

1139
00:52:13,881 --> 00:52:15,470
like he's in another dimension.

1140
00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:23,630
Tell him I tell him.
Take him off.

1141
00:52:27,910 --> 00:52:29,930
I'm not joking.
I'm serious actually.

1142
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:38,860
You're fine.
You're fine.

1143
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:44,740
You're fine buddy.
Get away

1144
00:52:45,890 --> 00:52:47,120
from him.
We'll leave him alone.

1145
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:51,950
Oh my God.
He was tripping so hard.

1146
00:52:54,370 --> 00:52:57,220
Did he think he was like suffocating?
I don't know at that.

1147
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:00,320
Explains the Turlock podcast during the 
podcast.

1148
00:53:00,321 --> 00:53:01,154
He explained it suffering there,
but what happened is they just probably 

1149
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:05,833
talking too much and it probably snapped
out of it and it was in the middle of 

1150
00:53:07,641 --> 00:53:11,870
this haze of reality and the illusion.
I think doing something like that,

1151
00:53:11,871 --> 00:53:13,610
like you got to be around people who are
going to be quiet,

1152
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:14,930
you know,
when you do it,

1153
00:53:15,470 --> 00:53:17,240
you know they're quiet and when they do 
it,

1154
00:53:17,241 --> 00:53:18,680
you're quiet.
Sit there.

1155
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:20,240
Yeah,
I did.

1156
00:53:20,241 --> 00:53:21,990
Uh,
after I saw you,

1157
00:53:21,991 --> 00:53:25,040
I saw you about a year ago.
I think I went from here to Mexico.

1158
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:26,520
I went to that Ibogaine

1159
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:28,100
clinic in Tijuana.
Ah,

1160
00:53:28,110 --> 00:53:28,943
you did?
Huh?

1161
00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:31,960
I didn't do the experience.
I want to see what it was like.

1162
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:32,813
Yeah.
I was doing a podcast with a doctor who 

1163
00:53:34,411 --> 00:53:38,130
works there and I met some people down 
there who had,

1164
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:40,020
um,
five meo DMT,

1165
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:45,390
the painter or the toad thing.
And I did that.

1166
00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:47,790
That was a,
that was really intense.

1167
00:53:47,791 --> 00:53:51,850
I'd never done dmt before.
I asked her but never smoked dmt five.

1168
00:53:51,870 --> 00:53:54,750
Mel was the really weird stuff because 
it's very empty.

1169
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,640
You,
you go away,

1170
00:53:56,970 --> 00:53:59,190
you go,
you go to the center of the university,

1171
00:53:59,191 --> 00:54:02,020
become everything I guess.
Yeah.

1172
00:54:02,021 --> 00:54:02,970
How strong.
I mean,

1173
00:54:02,971 --> 00:54:05,250
how much of a dose did you get?
Did you blast off?

1174
00:54:05,430 --> 00:54:08,220
Blast it off?
Did you feel like that?

1175
00:54:08,221 --> 00:54:12,320
Like you were gone the first few minutes
or you know,

1176
00:54:12,390 --> 00:54:14,310
who knows how many minutes or time,
whatever,

1177
00:54:14,311 --> 00:54:17,970
but the first period,
yeah,

1178
00:54:17,971 --> 00:54:18,804
there was that sort of ego dissolution 
where it's not me having this 

1179
00:54:22,411 --> 00:54:25,720
experience,
it's just fucking experience right now.

1180
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:26,633
It's just what it is.
Just colors and shapes and around holy 

1181
00:54:29,551 --> 00:54:30,384
fuck.
Right.

1182
00:54:30,990 --> 00:54:33,850
But that in my case,
and this just reminded me of it,

1183
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:35,280
watching already there,
in my case,

1184
00:54:35,281 --> 00:54:40,281
what happened was I got overwhelmed by 
sadness like I've because people,

1185
00:54:42,090 --> 00:54:42,923
some people I'm close to are going 
through really heavy shit in the last 

1186
00:54:45,930 --> 00:54:47,640
couple of years and you know,
you sorta,

1187
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:51,230
you feel compassion and you check in 
with them and you,

1188
00:54:51,370 --> 00:54:54,720
you compassion literally means to feel 
together.

1189
00:54:54,721 --> 00:54:57,420
Right?
And so you feel that with them.

1190
00:54:57,421 --> 00:55:01,020
But on another level it's like I'm not 
the one who's got ms,

1191
00:55:01,050 --> 00:55:01,883
you know,
I'm not the one who's got chronic pain 

1192
00:55:03,751 --> 00:55:06,090
and suffering all this shit.
Um,

1193
00:55:06,091 --> 00:55:08,670
so there's a separation.
But what I experienced with that was the

1194
00:55:08,671 --> 00:55:09,504
absence of separation.
And I was just immersed in the sadness 

1195
00:55:12,391 --> 00:55:15,570
of people I love and you know,
seeing them suffering and not being able

1196
00:55:15,571 --> 00:55:16,140
to help them.

1197
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:20,820
And it was overwhelming man.
I mean I cried like a baby literally.

1198
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:22,410
Wow.
And uh,

1199
00:55:22,411 --> 00:55:23,244
and then I started coming out of it and 
the room was quiet and he was 

1200
00:55:26,491 --> 00:55:30,960
candlelight and all this and the person 
who was sort of overseeing it was really

1201
00:55:30,961 --> 00:55:32,640
nice and you know,
sort of,

1202
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:33,533
okay,
you're starting to feel better now and 

1203
00:55:34,711 --> 00:55:35,544
here's the tissue and whatever.
And then the music came on and my first 

1204
00:55:40,681 --> 00:55:43,230
thought,
my first conscious thought was,

1205
00:55:44,010 --> 00:55:44,843
remember when I write the yelp review of
this experience to mention that the 

1206
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:53,511
music should be different because the 
music sucked.

1207
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:59,670
It was shit,
new age shit music.

1208
00:55:59,671 --> 00:56:01,770
And I was like,
if you're going to play music,

1209
00:56:01,771 --> 00:56:06,000
play some fucking Bach or something,
play some Yani or whatever the fuck this

1210
00:56:06,001 --> 00:56:07,740
is.
But my,

1211
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:08,973
you know,
I,

1212
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:12,450
not that I use yelp a lot,
but it was just sort of like,

1213
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:13,770
you know,
remember to mention this.

1214
00:56:13,771 --> 00:56:16,020
This could improve the experience for 
other people.

1215
00:56:16,021 --> 00:56:18,450
You know what the,
what a weird way of thinking.

1216
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:19,313
That's a very weird way of thinking.
So I had like this super profound 

1217
00:56:22,561 --> 00:56:23,980
experience encased in the

1218
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:26,410
most trivial bullshit imaginable.
I guess.

1219
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:27,393
Stan hope.
Did that five Meo dmt back when you 

1220
00:56:31,271 --> 00:56:32,890
could buy it online.
Yeah.

1221
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:34,930
And he did it at my place.
We did it together,

1222
00:56:35,230 --> 00:56:36,063
but he had never done it before.
I had done it a few times when he and I 

1223
00:56:39,821 --> 00:56:43,660
did it and he did it and I've never seen
anybody get hit by it harder.

1224
00:56:44,230 --> 00:56:45,063
Like he literally,
he was like slumped on my couch and he 

1225
00:56:49,061 --> 00:56:53,350
was making.
He was groaning like it was,

1226
00:56:53,650 --> 00:56:55,660
it was disturbing.
It was.

1227
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:56,800
It was.
So,

1228
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:59,680
it was so extreme that I was wondering 
like,

1229
00:56:59,681 --> 00:57:02,530
I knew that this is something that the 
human body makes.

1230
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:03,633
I knew that it's one of the most 
transient drugs ever observed in the 

1231
00:57:05,831 --> 00:57:06,664
body.
Your body brings it back to baseline 

1232
00:57:08,530 --> 00:57:10,440
really quickly,
but not at that dosage.

1233
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:13,710
It,
he didn't take that much in,

1234
00:57:13,750 --> 00:57:14,583
take any more than I took,
but it hit him like a Goddamn mack 

1235
00:57:18,251 --> 00:57:20,210
truck.
And uh,

1236
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:22,780
he came out of it and he just kept 
saying,

1237
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:23,853
life,
life just becomes life and then eats 

1238
00:57:26,060 --> 00:57:29,110
life becomes life and just life just 
becomes,

1239
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:32,020
this just goes on.
It just goes on,

1240
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:34,210
goes on.
Who's no denying that.

1241
00:57:34,211 --> 00:57:35,590
He's just looking at me like,
wow,

1242
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:37,270
I go,
you tripped balls.

1243
00:57:41,710 --> 00:57:42,880
But I was worried.
I was like,

1244
00:57:42,881 --> 00:57:45,850
I can't kill my friend.
I was literally word for a few minutes.

1245
00:57:45,851 --> 00:57:48,850
I was like,
what of his body just can't handle it.

1246
00:57:49,030 --> 00:57:52,030
Like,
because Doug is world famous for abusing

1247
00:57:52,031 --> 00:57:52,864
himself,
cigarettes and booze and it's just 

1248
00:57:54,941 --> 00:57:55,990
fucking,
he's got hernias.

1249
00:57:55,991 --> 00:57:56,824
You could stick out.
He can flex his stomach and things that 

1250
00:57:58,771 --> 00:58:00,400
pop out of his gun.
I'm not bullshitting.

1251
00:58:00,401 --> 00:58:02,320
He's hilarious.
But you know,

1252
00:58:02,321 --> 00:58:03,480
he's a maniac.
He's just,

1253
00:58:03,850 --> 00:58:04,683
there's not a game man.
He's not playing an act as doug that he 

1254
00:58:08,921 --> 00:58:09,754
is who he is.
And I was thinking maybe this is like 

1255
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:16,620
slapping a corvette engine into a 1969 
dodge dart that's got 299,000

1256
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:22,120
miles and just share wheels on the back,
bad breaks.

1257
00:58:22,130 --> 00:58:23,620
And it just seemed like,
well,

1258
00:58:23,621 --> 00:58:27,400
what have I done?
I shot up to it because when I did it,

1259
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:30,160
it felt like I got shot through a 
cannon.

1260
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:33,010
It was like,
like the,

1261
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:36,370
the experience of the launch,
like it came on slow,

1262
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:39,970
like it came on,
like it took a few seconds and then once

1263
00:58:39,971 --> 00:58:40,804
it hit itches it's almost like you're 
pulling back against a catapult band or 

1264
00:58:44,191 --> 00:58:49,191
a rubber band or slingshot and just.
And then it was just flying to know me.

1265
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:54,190
So like where I flew to,
there was no me,

1266
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:59,220
there was no difference between me and 
the air that's in front of me and the,

1267
00:58:59,470 --> 00:59:00,303
the wood that makes this table and the 
floor beneath and all the different 

1268
00:59:03,731 --> 00:59:04,564
molecules and atoms I could broke down 
the existence of everything to some 

1269
00:59:10,331 --> 00:59:15,331
strange geometric level and it was 
really intense and totally colorless.

1270
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:16,653
It's like a big white thing,
like it would bring you to this weird 

1271
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:22,490
geometric white thing.

1272
00:59:23,090 --> 00:59:27,800
Whereas DMT is come n n 
dimethyltryptamine is five,

1273
00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:28,723
methoxy dimethyltryptamine is five meo 
and it's just a different visual 

1274
00:59:32,031 --> 00:59:32,864
experience than n n dimethyltryptamine,
which was the one that brings you these 

1275
00:59:35,481 --> 00:59:39,710
intense visions of geometric patterns 
and dancing.

1276
00:59:39,950 --> 00:59:40,783
Like the last time I did it it was they 
were dancing jokers that were giving me 

1277
00:59:44,001 --> 00:59:44,834
the finger.
They just kept giving me the finger and 

1278
00:59:47,001 --> 00:59:47,751
I was like,
Oh yeah,

1279
00:59:47,751 --> 00:59:49,360
I deserve that.
Like I felt it,

1280
00:59:49,361 --> 00:59:50,540
like as they were doing it,
they're like,

1281
00:59:50,630 --> 00:59:52,610
fuck you,
fuck you.

1282
00:59:52,790 --> 00:59:53,900
And I was realizing like,
oh,

1283
00:59:53,901 --> 00:59:55,070
someone needs to say that to me.
Like,

1284
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:56,450
oh,
I'm being silly person.

1285
00:59:56,750 --> 00:59:59,150
Like by even trying to control this 
trip,

1286
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:02,960
like by even like thinking that like I'm
just going to go into this.

1287
01:00:02,961 --> 01:00:04,370
I've been doing,
I'm been a good boy,

1288
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:07,190
but doing my yoga and eating healthy and
this should be a good good trip.

1289
01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:08,510
Fuck you.
It was like,

1290
01:00:08,511 --> 01:00:10,670
fuck you.
You've got no control out of this.

1291
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:13,250
You better relaxed,
which makes it a heroic dose.

1292
01:00:13,310 --> 01:00:14,870
You gotta let go.
Well,

1293
01:00:14,871 --> 01:00:15,704
all DMT is a heroic dose.
Once you passed that three hit 

1294
01:00:18,201 --> 01:00:19,034
threshold,
right?

1295
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:20,690
Good bye.
You're gone.

1296
01:00:20,740 --> 01:00:21,880
There's no,
there's no,

1297
01:00:22,670 --> 01:00:23,600
no,
you're gone.

1298
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:25,970
You're gone or you're gone.
They're just gone.

1299
01:00:26,090 --> 01:00:27,680
Yeah.
That heroic dose I took,

1300
01:00:27,681 --> 01:00:30,360
I ended up.
I mean the story was a lot of weird shit

1301
01:00:30,390 --> 01:00:33,620
how he never got done explaining how 
much did it actually take four hits.

1302
01:00:33,950 --> 01:00:34,640
Oh,
Jesus.

1303
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:35,473
Yeah,
because I gave this old psychiatrist 

1304
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:40,040
three hits and I saw him a couple of 
weeks later and he was like,

1305
01:00:40,041 --> 01:00:41,240
oh,
that was good clean stuff.

1306
01:00:41,490 --> 01:00:42,323
No problem.
It was,

1307
01:00:42,650 --> 01:00:43,483
and I thought,
well if that guy he's in his sixties 

1308
01:00:44,721 --> 01:00:46,190
could take three.
I'll take four.

1309
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:47,173
I met this dude in Montana recently,
very nice guy named Jeff and he was 

1310
01:00:49,821 --> 01:00:53,450
working with us on this mediator show 
and he's told us that he took 25 hits of

1311
01:00:53,451 --> 01:00:54,284
acid one night.

1312
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:57,530
See I,
I went back in the day.

1313
01:00:57,531 --> 01:01:01,850
I did five or six or whatever,
but I felt like there was a plateau,

1314
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:04,490
like I couldn't trip any harder than I 
tripped.

1315
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,370
So I,
I don't know that 20 would be.

1316
01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:09,290
Yeah,
he just went with it.

1317
01:01:09,291 --> 01:01:11,210
He said,
I forget how he described it,

1318
01:01:11,740 --> 01:01:14,270
but just went with it.
I just,

1319
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:18,350
last night I watched this documentary 
called the sunshine makers,

1320
01:01:18,351 --> 01:01:19,184
about the guys Owsley and,
and the two guys who were making orange 

1321
01:01:21,891 --> 01:01:24,950
sunshine together,
the famous acid of the sixties.

1322
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:27,550
Oh yeah.
And one of the guys was like,

1323
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:28,430
that's all.
Send those.

1324
01:01:28,431 --> 01:01:29,990
Right.
That's all Sandoz lamps.

1325
01:01:30,050 --> 01:01:31,550
No,
that was the legal shit.

1326
01:01:31,551 --> 01:01:36,380
And so this is the guys in California 
and Colorado briefly who were making the

1327
01:01:36,381 --> 01:01:38,520
illegal stuff.
Um,

1328
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:40,430
and who,
who was in the sunshine,

1329
01:01:40,970 --> 01:01:42,650
I forget.
There's two guys.

1330
01:01:42,710 --> 01:01:44,820
The one guy was a ghost champions.
Got.

1331
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:45,920
It.
Was a documentary.

1332
01:01:46,410 --> 01:01:47,243
Nicholas Tim scully,
unlikely duo at the heart of the 19 

1333
01:01:50,481 --> 01:01:54,140
sixties American drug countercultural.
Yeah,

1334
01:01:54,141 --> 01:01:54,974
it's quite good.
It's so weird that that was so 

1335
01:01:57,171 --> 01:01:58,004
incredibly recent,
but within a few decades they had 

1336
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:04,850
basically erased all evidence of it from
culture except for a few fringe people,

1337
01:02:05,340 --> 01:02:06,173
you know?
Yeah.

1338
01:02:06,260 --> 01:02:07,700
I mean,
talking about old research,

1339
01:02:07,701 --> 01:02:08,534
there were thousands,
tens of thousands of scientific papers 

1340
01:02:10,611 --> 01:02:13,730
published on how hallucinogens affect 
the brain.

1341
01:02:14,030 --> 01:02:16,790
In fact,
the Sarah Turner Jack System,

1342
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:20,070
the whole understanding of 
neurotransmitters really

1343
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:23,790
was fueled by trying to understand how 
so little lsd could make you so high.

1344
01:02:24,390 --> 01:02:25,223
That's what,
that's what got people into looking at 

1345
01:02:26,641 --> 01:02:27,474
neurotransmitters in the effects on 
consciousness in the late fifties 

1346
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:31,740
anyway.
I mean,

1347
01:02:31,741 --> 01:02:36,420
we could talk for ever about how a 
hallucinogens have changed culture.

1348
01:02:36,930 --> 01:02:38,760
But uh,
what the hell was I saying?

1349
01:02:38,761 --> 01:02:39,594
Oh,
so you took forehead and the movie this 

1350
01:02:41,041 --> 01:02:42,210
guy says,
yeah,

1351
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:44,280
but the movie this guy says,
um,

1352
01:02:44,610 --> 01:02:46,560
you know,
he's talking about how they're doing the

1353
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:49,170
vats and he's a chemist.
He's like,

1354
01:02:49,171 --> 01:02:51,810
every once in a while you know,
you touch something and it's hot and you

1355
01:02:51,811 --> 01:02:52,231
go,
Oh,

1356
01:02:52,231 --> 01:02:53,820
and you put your thumb in your mouth.
And I'm like,

1357
01:02:53,850 --> 01:02:56,850
oh,
I just took 200 micrograms of LSD.

1358
01:02:57,210 --> 01:02:58,043
They go,
well,

1359
01:02:58,050 --> 01:03:00,060
they were high all the time while they 
were working.

1360
01:03:00,890 --> 01:03:04,810
Yeah.
And that's actually 22,000

1361
01:03:05,820 --> 01:03:07,230
La isn't there like a number?

1362
01:03:07,230 --> 01:03:09,510
Like someone told me,
this is maybe one of those urban myths,

1363
01:03:09,511 --> 01:03:10,344
like you have to register your hands as 
lethal weapons once you get your black 

1364
01:03:12,211 --> 01:03:14,370
belt.
That was an urban with too,

1365
01:03:14,550 --> 01:03:17,790
but isn't there an urban myth that like 
if you do a certain amount of acid,

1366
01:03:17,791 --> 01:03:19,800
you're considered legally insane?
I heard that.

1367
01:03:19,801 --> 01:03:21,630
I don't know.
I don't know if that's true.

1368
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:24,270
I hope it is because then I'm like free 
and clear.

1369
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:25,680
Let me see.
Jamie's at real.

1370
01:03:26,820 --> 01:03:28,970
That's what I've heard that my whole 
life as well.

1371
01:03:29,820 --> 01:03:31,230
Do you remember hearing that?
It's bullshit.

1372
01:03:31,270 --> 01:03:32,880
I was like seven hits and make you 
insane.

1373
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:35,760
You're gone bro.
Legally.

1374
01:03:35,790 --> 01:03:36,623
So anything you do afterwards,
if you can prove you tripped at least 

1375
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:40,490
whatever,
seven times.

1376
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:41,393
People that have done big doses of acid 
and some of them have had a really hard 

1377
01:03:44,401 --> 01:03:48,330
time grasping regular reality and I 
wonder if there's a correlation.

1378
01:03:48,330 --> 01:03:49,163
I wonder if there's a connection between
like some of them have like really 

1379
01:03:51,061 --> 01:03:54,420
distorted perceptions of what's going on
right now in terms of like,

1380
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:57,540
like an experience will happen and 
they'll have a version of the experience

1381
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:00,330
and you'll relay your version of that 
experience and they didn't.

1382
01:04:00,350 --> 01:04:02,010
They didn't remember that at all and 
you're like,

1383
01:04:02,011 --> 01:04:04,770
man,
I don't know who's got this right,

1384
01:04:04,771 --> 01:04:06,330
because memory is kind of a slippery 
thing,

1385
01:04:06,331 --> 01:04:08,250
but I don't remember him saying that to 
you,

1386
01:04:08,251 --> 01:04:09,084
man.
I don't remember someone doing that to 

1387
01:04:09,841 --> 01:04:11,250
you.
I don't remember that going down.

1388
01:04:11,251 --> 01:04:12,084
Like people have these weird perceived 
interactions that maybe are a little 

1389
01:04:15,631 --> 01:04:16,464
skewed and I always wonder like,
is it the 39 hits of acid you took one 

1390
01:04:20,761 --> 01:04:21,331
night?
Is it,

1391
01:04:21,331 --> 01:04:22,500
I mean,
did you blow a fuse?

1392
01:04:22,501 --> 01:04:24,450
Can you blow a few of these in it?
Like you know,

1393
01:04:24,451 --> 01:04:28,110
somebody who works out and they mess up 
their back and you say,

1394
01:04:28,111 --> 01:04:28,944
well you can blame it on working out or 
you could blame it on and working out 

1395
01:04:30,691 --> 01:04:31,524
wrong or you could blame it on the fact 
that you probably already had a 

1396
01:04:33,781 --> 01:04:37,110
structural issue in your back that this 
just uncovered.

1397
01:04:37,610 --> 01:04:38,443
So I think a lot of people who have bad 
experiences or end up fucked up from 

1398
01:04:42,181 --> 01:04:45,510
hallucinogens,
they're going to be fucked up anyway.

1399
01:04:45,710 --> 01:04:48,000
And there are psychotic breaks.
You know,

1400
01:04:48,001 --> 01:04:49,890
like this kid that I talked about 
earlier,

1401
01:04:49,891 --> 01:04:52,170
Nance Amsterdam,
he had a psychotic break,

1402
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:53,633
but generally you can recover from that 
and you'll be fine unless there's some 

1403
01:04:58,170 --> 01:05:01,290
underlying structural issue in your 
personality.

1404
01:05:02,110 --> 01:05:03,320
You know,
so I don't know.

1405
01:05:03,590 --> 01:05:06,340
I think it's multifactorial like 
everything.

1406
01:05:06,341 --> 01:05:08,850
And so ultimately I think you're totally
right.

1407
01:05:08,851 --> 01:05:09,684
That completely makes sense and it's one
of the things that you've got to think 

1408
01:05:12,091 --> 01:05:12,924
about when you talk about food or 
alcohol or anything that people want up 

1409
01:05:16,171 --> 01:05:17,400
getting addicted to,
right?

1410
01:05:17,950 --> 01:05:18,250
People

1411
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:21,880
can blow their brains out on a variety 
of different substances that are readily

1412
01:05:21,881 --> 01:05:22,714
available.
We're always looking for the reason for 

1413
01:05:25,601 --> 01:05:26,434
the effect,
but normally it's a million reasons for 

1414
01:05:28,121 --> 01:05:28,954
an effect,
but it's no constellation if your son 

1415
01:05:30,311 --> 01:05:32,180
goes crazy from taking acid,
you know,

1416
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:36,790
it's one of those things if acid became 
legal and your son walked into a cvs and

1417
01:05:37,180 --> 01:05:38,013
bought acid and did too much with his 
friends and never came back and you had 

1418
01:05:40,001 --> 01:05:42,600
to take care of him when he's 50.
No,

1419
01:05:42,610 --> 01:05:44,270
it's no constellation.
But you know,

1420
01:05:44,271 --> 01:05:45,104
a lot of people have psychotic breaks 
when their girlfriend breaks up with 

1421
01:05:47,021 --> 01:05:48,160
them the first time.
It's true.

1422
01:05:48,180 --> 01:05:50,710
So are we going to blame women for 
psychosis?

1423
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:51,553
You know,
it's hard to describe or to really 

1424
01:05:53,621 --> 01:05:55,900
recognize like what is a psychotic 
break,

1425
01:05:56,110 --> 01:05:59,290
what is real mental illness and when are
you just being a bitch?

1426
01:06:01,150 --> 01:06:01,983
Well,
a professional should be able to 

1427
01:06:03,431 --> 01:06:05,170
recognize.
I would hope so.

1428
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:07,900
At least when you're just being near an 
edge,

1429
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:09,033
during an edge to like mental illness 
and just being a bench like we're 

1430
01:06:13,511 --> 01:06:14,950
talking about.
Psychosis.

1431
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:17,650
Neurosis.
One more time,

1432
01:06:17,651 --> 01:06:18,940
dude,
don't call her.

1433
01:06:18,941 --> 01:06:20,100
I've got to call her.
No you don't.

1434
01:06:20,530 --> 01:06:22,650
You don't have to call it.
The universe was telling me to call her.

1435
01:06:22,860 --> 01:06:23,693
I have to talk to her right now.
She'll understand what's her talked to 

1436
01:06:24,731 --> 01:06:27,370
her.
There is a restraining order.

1437
01:06:27,460 --> 01:06:29,770
Stop.
Do you want to go to jail?

1438
01:06:29,771 --> 01:06:32,070
I'm just going to knock on our window.
Don't do it.

1439
01:06:33,460 --> 01:06:34,293
There's people that get obsessed with 
people when it comes to relationships 

1440
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:37,473
and you just go,
what will people get addicted to each 

1441
01:06:39,821 --> 01:06:40,654
other?
They get as addicted to each other as 

1442
01:06:41,771 --> 01:06:42,604
they get addicted to sugar easily.
It's harder for people to break up with 

1443
01:06:45,821 --> 01:06:46,900
people than it is from the kick.

1444
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:50,530
Sugar people can kick sugar.
They decide they want to lose weight.

1445
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:51,393
A lot of people do it,
but when people break up like the 

1446
01:06:53,531 --> 01:06:54,364
emotional toll that you take,
it's so devastating and I think part of 

1447
01:06:59,501 --> 01:07:00,334
the reason why the emotional toll so 
devastating and less being with the 

1448
01:07:02,531 --> 01:07:05,860
person was completely negative.
It was completely negative.

1449
01:07:05,861 --> 01:07:06,850
Then you're like,
finally,

1450
01:07:06,851 --> 01:07:07,684
I'm fucking free.
I've met a few of those in my life and 

1451
01:07:09,341 --> 01:07:11,320
I'm sure you have to,
but there's other ones.

1452
01:07:11,321 --> 01:07:12,101
We like,
God,

1453
01:07:12,101 --> 01:07:12,934
this feels terrible,
and it's like it's stuck a emotional 

1454
01:07:15,971 --> 01:07:17,180
flu.
No,

1455
01:07:17,250 --> 01:07:20,770
it doesn't want to go away,
and I think it's because we get addicted

1456
01:07:20,771 --> 01:07:21,604
to each other in the same way that we 
bonded to create these communal tribes 

1457
01:07:25,661 --> 01:07:30,130
have 50 people back in the day.
Those instincts still remain and I think

1458
01:07:30,370 --> 01:07:31,203
one of the reward systems,
and you would know better than I have 

1459
01:07:33,700 --> 01:07:34,533
connecting everybody together with this 
is got to be this deep affection and 

1460
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:41,380
this addiction that we developed towards
each other.

1461
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:42,131
Yeah,
well,

1462
01:07:42,131 --> 01:07:43,810
we,
we need to be loved.

1463
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:44,673
We need to be touched.
And a lot of times if you don't have a 

1464
01:07:46,481 --> 01:07:47,770
partner,
nobody's touching,

1465
01:07:47,790 --> 01:07:50,260
you know,
as an adult.

1466
01:07:50,860 --> 01:07:52,600
And uh,
yeah,

1467
01:07:52,601 --> 01:07:56,230
I mean I love is a funny thing.
I talk about this a lot on the podcast,

1468
01:07:56,340 --> 01:07:57,210
you know,
I guess I'm.

1469
01:07:57,310 --> 01:07:59,530
People think I'm some sort of 
relationship expert,

1470
01:08:00,370 --> 01:08:02,000
which is hilarious.
Um,

1471
01:08:02,230 --> 01:08:03,063
but,
uh,

1472
01:08:03,650 --> 01:08:05,020
I,
I told this,

1473
01:08:05,021 --> 01:08:06,640
I don't know if I've told this story in 
your podcast,

1474
01:08:06,641 --> 01:08:10,690
but my dad has this golden retriever and
he's had like five of them.

1475
01:08:10,691 --> 01:08:12,220
They all look the same.
I don't know this one,

1476
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:13,720
just the last one thing,
brandy.

1477
01:08:13,750 --> 01:08:16,130
Okay.
So the fourth of July

1478
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:16,963
they had the dog out in the backyard and
they went to watch some fourth of July 

1479
01:08:20,420 --> 01:08:21,680
things,
some party somewhere.

1480
01:08:21,681 --> 01:08:22,514
And apparently the fireworks scared the 
dog and the dog jumped a fence and took 

1481
01:08:25,131 --> 01:08:26,210
off.
Oh No,

1482
01:08:26,330 --> 01:08:29,870
and so my dad and my sister were all 
freaked out and they're putting up store

1483
01:08:30,710 --> 01:08:31,543
signs all over the neighborhood and 
Colin and the shelters and all that day 

1484
01:08:34,491 --> 01:08:35,960
or two later,
they get a call from shelter.

1485
01:08:35,961 --> 01:08:37,700
Hey,
we've got your dog come down and like,

1486
01:08:37,730 --> 01:08:38,640
oh,
there she is,

1487
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:40,113
so take the dog home.
They're in the backyard throwing the 

1488
01:08:42,381 --> 01:08:45,830
ball with the dog,
and my sister's boyfriend comes home and

1489
01:08:45,831 --> 01:08:47,570
he looks out the window and he says to 
my mom,

1490
01:08:47,810 --> 01:08:50,810
who's dog are they play in with?
She said,

1491
01:08:50,811 --> 01:08:51,730
well,
that's brandy.

1492
01:08:52,020 --> 01:08:53,480
And he said,
that's not brandy.

1493
01:08:54,350 --> 01:08:56,000
And then a few minutes later the phone 
rings.

1494
01:08:56,001 --> 01:08:56,960
It's a neighbor.
Hey,

1495
01:08:56,961 --> 01:08:59,060
we've got brandy.
Oh Jesus,

1496
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:00,590
it's the wrong dog.
Right?

1497
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:01,833
So what do they do?
They took it back to the found should 

1498
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:04,333
killed it.

1499
01:09:05,950 --> 01:09:10,950
Your imposter.
You try to pretend you're not branding,

1500
01:09:13,940 --> 01:09:16,460
respond to brandy fraud,
but my point,

1501
01:09:16,461 --> 01:09:16,911
yeah,
no,

1502
01:09:16,911 --> 01:09:18,770
the dog was like,
what did I do wrong?

1503
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:20,150
I chased your ball.
You know,

1504
01:09:20,190 --> 01:09:21,020
I mean,
they were.

1505
01:09:21,020 --> 01:09:23,380
They sound like a great dog owner.
They should have just kept that.

1506
01:09:23,410 --> 01:09:24,243
She brought it back.
They found of exactly where you adopt a 

1507
01:09:27,521 --> 01:09:29,600
kid and again,
I'm going to send you back.

1508
01:09:29,650 --> 01:09:31,790
Yeah.
If somebody comes looking for that dog,

1509
01:09:31,820 --> 01:09:34,090
then call me until then.
The dog lives here.

1510
01:09:34,100 --> 01:09:36,170
Should have been.
You can't bring it back.

1511
01:09:36,190 --> 01:09:38,120
The power.
What a fucking drag for the dog.

1512
01:09:38,121 --> 01:09:38,954
I know,
but my point is there in the backyard 

1513
01:09:41,750 --> 01:09:43,700
with the dog.
What are they feeling?

1514
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:48,380
My Dad's feeling incredible relief.
Brandi's back love.

1515
01:09:48,410 --> 01:09:51,140
He loves brandy,
brandy,

1516
01:09:52,490 --> 01:09:53,323
but it doesn't matter because he's still
feeling love and I think we do that in 

1517
01:09:57,561 --> 01:09:58,520
our relationships.

1518
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:02,210
We project our need to love on whoever 
the fuck will take it.

1519
01:10:02,630 --> 01:10:03,920
I mean,
what's that Beatle Song?

1520
01:10:03,921 --> 01:10:07,370
I need somebody to love and then in the 
back you ever listed in the back,

1521
01:10:07,371 --> 01:10:11,210
they see can it be anybody?
And then he says,

1522
01:10:11,211 --> 01:10:14,000
I just want someone to love.
I don't give a fuck who it is.

1523
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:17,120
I just want a dog.
I don't care.

1524
01:10:17,121 --> 01:10:19,370
I want a girlfriend.
Take whatever.

1525
01:10:19,371 --> 01:10:21,950
What do you do?
That's a thing with a lot of people that

1526
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:24,290
don't have relationships.
They have a bunch of pets.

1527
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:26,600
Yeah,
they need someone or something.

1528
01:10:26,820 --> 01:10:29,320
I love anytime.
You know,

1529
01:10:29,380 --> 01:10:30,910
if you're a single person,
you come home,

1530
01:10:30,930 --> 01:10:31,763
your dogs are so happy to see you really
couldn't your kisses in get your pets 

1531
01:10:37,071 --> 01:10:37,821
in.
Yeah,

1532
01:10:37,821 --> 01:10:41,150
I mean dogs are like emotional bandaids 
for a lot of people.

1533
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:42,920
Even cats,
you have cats.

1534
01:10:43,220 --> 01:10:45,890
I love cats and they don't give a fuck.
Don't give a fuck.

1535
01:10:45,891 --> 01:10:46,724
Are you there or not?
But they'll sit on your lap and purr 

1536
01:10:47,961 --> 01:10:48,980
when you pet them.
Yeah,

1537
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:51,950
they'll accept your love,
which is nice.

1538
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:55,280
Sometimes that's enough dogs better 
obviously,

1539
01:10:55,281 --> 01:10:57,480
you know,
I can't believe you can get new cats.

1540
01:10:59,490 --> 01:11:01,940
Fucking shows sucks,
right?

1541
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:03,553
I forget where they are.
The millions of listening and it's just 

1542
01:11:06,090 --> 01:11:09,350
such a hackneyed debate.
Dogs versus cats.

1543
01:11:09,351 --> 01:11:12,680
I'm really into fucking aardvarks bro.
Pet aardvark.

1544
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:14,220
Yeah.
I watched a video

1545
01:11:14,220 --> 01:11:15,053
online of a wild pig that had eaten 
through a cow's body and got stuck in 

1546
01:11:19,621 --> 01:11:20,454
the farmer,
found the cow and this wild pig is like 

1547
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:25,630
coming out through a hole in its 
stomach,

1548
01:11:25,631 --> 01:11:29,250
like he'd eaten through the cow and got 
stuck.

1549
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:32,820
It's like Jim Carrey and pet detective 
when he comes out of the Zebra.

1550
01:11:33,740 --> 01:11:35,190
Is this it?
Yeah,

1551
01:11:35,191 --> 01:11:37,050
there it is.
You watch a lot of gross shit,

1552
01:11:37,051 --> 01:11:38,230
but this is not that gross.
See,

1553
01:11:38,231 --> 01:11:39,240
look at it.
It's stuck.

1554
01:11:39,730 --> 01:11:42,870
I can't get out of the body,
the skin,

1555
01:11:43,230 --> 01:11:44,063
the skin of the cow at eight through it,
but then it can't get fat body through 

1556
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:49,000
and got his head through,
but he can't fit the rest of it through.

1557
01:11:49,110 --> 01:11:49,943
How could it not back out.
Doesn't know what to do with stupid 

1558
01:11:52,650 --> 01:11:55,590
fucking wild pig.
I have a friend who has a pig.

1559
01:11:55,710 --> 01:11:56,700
A pet pig.

1560
01:11:57,260 --> 01:11:59,080
A potbelly pig.
Yeah,

1561
01:11:59,220 --> 01:12:00,770
exactly it.
Apparently he passed.

1562
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:03,370
It's like really smart.
Yeah.

1563
01:12:04,690 --> 01:12:05,523
Yeah.
It's a bummer if there's a little 

1564
01:12:06,870 --> 01:12:10,110
bacon's a bummer.
If you think about what is it is.

1565
01:12:10,111 --> 01:12:13,200
I keep trying to find cruelty free bacon
and it's just not.

1566
01:12:13,201 --> 01:12:15,990
They're not real.
I can't find you got to shoot a pig.

1567
01:12:15,991 --> 01:12:16,824
Get Bacon.
Just a certain amount of cruelty 

1568
01:12:17,821 --> 01:12:20,850
involved in that delicious Taylor here.
A pig or see a pink dye.

1569
01:12:20,940 --> 01:12:22,130
I've killed pigs.
Cope.

1570
01:12:22,770 --> 01:12:23,880
They don't die.
Happy.

1571
01:12:23,910 --> 01:12:24,310
Well,
I.

1572
01:12:24,310 --> 01:12:25,143
The one I killed died real quick,
shot it with a 300 win mag and died 

1573
01:12:28,531 --> 01:12:32,220
instantly in the head,
in the body body cavity like blue.

1574
01:12:32,221 --> 01:12:34,770
It's hard out,
but he died instantaneously.

1575
01:12:34,940 --> 01:12:35,773
Turned around.
I drove a 300 the scope into my 

1576
01:12:38,971 --> 01:12:41,760
forehead.
That was nice.

1577
01:12:41,761 --> 01:12:42,594
Got a lot of kick.
It's a good round because anything it 

1578
01:12:45,931 --> 01:12:49,530
hits dies very humanely,
very quickly if you hit it right,

1579
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:50,620
obviously.

1580
01:12:50,620 --> 01:12:52,080
Yeah,
but I'm wild.

1581
01:12:52,081 --> 01:12:52,914
Pigs are a huge problem and I know that 
pig people have a problem with people 

1582
01:12:57,901 --> 01:13:01,860
eating animals and I get that,
but there's always going to be an issue.

1583
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:06,060
Even if we didn't need any animals.
If you don't want all of your vegetables

1584
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:06,923
eaten up by wild pigs,
somebody has to control the population 

1585
01:13:09,391 --> 01:13:12,960
because there's no way to control them.
They breed at a staggering rate.

1586
01:13:13,470 --> 01:13:16,200
They breed three or four.
I mean they'll have these letters.

1587
01:13:16,230 --> 01:13:18,330
They can have literally two,
three times a year.

1588
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:21,390
They started having litters when they're
six months old,

1589
01:13:21,630 --> 01:13:24,720
when they're six months old,
they start shitting out pigs and there's

1590
01:13:24,721 --> 01:13:25,940
a ton of them.
I mean,

1591
01:13:25,980 --> 01:13:29,550
there's around Sonoma county.
I've been in San Jose,

1592
01:13:29,551 --> 01:13:31,890
they're eating people's lawns and 
residential neighborhoods.

1593
01:13:31,891 --> 01:13:34,860
They're not to be fucked with you.
Don't get outta here.

1594
01:13:34,861 --> 01:13:35,694
Pig.
They'll kill your dog to the fuck your 

1595
01:13:37,290 --> 01:13:39,200
dog up and slice them up and they'll eat
them too.

1596
01:13:39,220 --> 01:13:40,890
Once he's dead.
Their tusks,

1597
01:13:40,891 --> 01:13:43,770
like especially the big boars,
they're enormous animals too.

1598
01:13:43,771 --> 01:13:44,970
You're talking about like some of them 
were.

1599
01:13:45,450 --> 01:13:46,283
They shot one at that to hone.
Ranch thing was about 350 pounds last 

1600
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:51,440
week.
Three hundred 50 pounds for.

1601
01:13:51,710 --> 01:13:55,290
This is a wild snorting,
horrific beast.

1602
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:58,620
It's not a fat pig wallowing around 
there.

1603
01:13:58,621 --> 01:14:00,750
Fast and aggressive.
They're fast,

1604
01:14:00,751 --> 01:14:01,584
aggressive and ferocious.
They have a what's called a a shield 

1605
01:14:04,951 --> 01:14:09,930
plate all around their front body,
like where their face is like from their

1606
01:14:09,931 --> 01:14:10,764
jaw line back.
They have this incredibly thick like 

1607
01:14:14,291 --> 01:14:15,124
leather and it's to protect them from 
going to war with other male bores in 

1608
01:14:19,521 --> 01:14:20,354
those giant tusks,
so they fucking slice each other up and 

1609
01:14:23,081 --> 01:14:28,081
so these things are just their tanks.
They're super durable tanks who are born

1610
01:14:28,751 --> 01:14:32,890
at a ridiculous rate if there's millions
of them roaming through the country.

1611
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:37,450
And there was an article that I posted 
on twitter just a few days ago where,

1612
01:14:37,451 --> 01:14:38,284
uh,
the scientists were saying it's just a 

1613
01:14:39,791 --> 01:14:44,530
matter of time before every county in 
every state has a wild pig problem.

1614
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:45,753
It's just there.
They're not stopping the breeding and 

1615
01:14:47,351 --> 01:14:48,184
not stopping the growth and they're just
going to slowly spread out like coyote 

1616
01:14:51,011 --> 01:14:51,160
roadies

1617
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:52,300
and the meat's good,
right?

1618
01:14:52,390 --> 01:14:53,170
Oh,
it's really good.

1619
01:14:53,170 --> 01:14:56,280
It's delicious.
The perfect situation because you're,

1620
01:14:56,350 --> 01:14:59,140
you're killing something that needs to 
be killed,

1621
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:00,393
you know,
it used to be cougars were killing them 

1622
01:15:01,631 --> 01:15:02,464
and you know,
whatever other predators we're keeping 

1623
01:15:04,481 --> 01:15:05,950
them in check.
There's no not,

1624
01:15:05,980 --> 01:15:09,220
they're an invasive species.
They weren't native to North America.

1625
01:15:09,221 --> 01:15:10,780
Now they're brought over here from 
Russia.

1626
01:15:10,900 --> 01:15:11,733
They were brought over here from Asia.
They brought over here from different 

1627
01:15:13,451 --> 01:15:14,284
parts of the world are some ferocious 
Russian ones that are in the northern 

1628
01:15:16,751 --> 01:15:21,751
California coast that are connected to,
I think it was William Randolph hearst,

1629
01:15:22,420 --> 01:15:23,253
the hearst castle up there.
I think William Randolph hearst had 

1630
01:15:25,860 --> 01:15:28,570
bores up there.
It's one more thing they came from,

1631
01:15:28,571 --> 01:15:29,710
there were predators,
you know,

1632
01:15:29,730 --> 01:15:30,750
well,
the Siberia,

1633
01:15:31,010 --> 01:15:31,843
they,
you know,

1634
01:15:32,020 --> 01:15:34,860
they probably lived in incredibly harsh 
environments and it's one of the reasons

1635
01:15:34,861 --> 01:15:35,770
why they thrive here.

1636
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:36,633
Yeah.
And my point is there's no Predator now 

1637
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:40,420
they're living free.
They're not,

1638
01:15:40,450 --> 01:15:41,283
they're not like pigs that are turned 
into bacon or fucking cages where they 

1639
01:15:44,261 --> 01:15:46,120
can turn around and all that shit.
See,

1640
01:15:46,121 --> 01:15:47,850
that's the thing that gets me.
I mean,

1641
01:15:47,890 --> 01:15:51,850
I have no problem eating meat because as
Doug Stanhope said,

1642
01:15:51,851 --> 01:15:53,200
life becomes life.
You know,

1643
01:15:53,220 --> 01:15:55,060
life eats life.
That's what it does.

1644
01:15:55,061 --> 01:15:55,894
There's no getting around that.
There's a book called the Vegetarian 

1645
01:15:58,030 --> 01:15:58,863
Myth.
You ever read that?

1646
01:15:59,410 --> 01:16:00,370
Um,
yes.

1647
01:16:00,371 --> 01:16:03,760
It was a woman who was a Vegan for 20 
years and then she's like,

1648
01:16:03,761 --> 01:16:04,594
I'm going to grow my own food.
And as soon as she started growing her 

1649
01:16:07,571 --> 01:16:09,790
own food,
she realized there's no way to even grow

1650
01:16:09,791 --> 01:16:10,624
food without killing stuff.
You got to put this stuff down to 

1651
01:16:13,181 --> 01:16:16,150
protect the garden from the slugs and 
kills the slugs.

1652
01:16:16,510 --> 01:16:19,210
The fertilizer is made out of bone and 
blood meal.

1653
01:16:19,270 --> 01:16:20,790
Where's that come from?
Right.

1654
01:16:21,010 --> 01:16:24,070
It's like there's no way to not kill 
things in order to eat.

1655
01:16:24,340 --> 01:16:27,340
Even if you're eating vegetables,
you still killing things to eat them.

1656
01:16:27,700 --> 01:16:29,680
Well,
that's the connection to the actual food

1657
01:16:29,681 --> 01:16:30,514
itself.
Rate right from the source and it gives 

1658
01:16:31,691 --> 01:16:33,880
you this understanding of it,
but still you can,

1659
01:16:34,270 --> 01:16:36,620
you can mitigate the amount of suffering
that you've asked.

1660
01:16:36,670 --> 01:16:37,900
What I was going to say.
Yeah.

1661
01:16:37,901 --> 01:16:40,600
I've got no problem eating something 
that lived a life,

1662
01:16:40,990 --> 01:16:43,090
a free life.
Like these wild boars.

1663
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:43,973
Yeah.
What I have a problem with is the 

1664
01:16:44,681 --> 01:16:47,030
industrial process,
you know,

1665
01:16:47,140 --> 01:16:50,800
wild boar is,
might be one of the few things that we,

1666
01:16:50,801 --> 01:16:51,634
um,
we almost have enough where everybody 

1667
01:16:53,111 --> 01:16:57,670
can hunt them because I mean there's not
enough deer.

1668
01:16:57,671 --> 01:17:01,690
There's not enough elk for people to,
to hunt in this country.

1669
01:17:01,691 --> 01:17:04,810
Like if everybody wanted to do what some
people are trying to do with it,

1670
01:17:04,811 --> 01:17:05,644
just trying to get all the meat from the
wild does it just not enough wild but 

1671
01:17:09,561 --> 01:17:11,630
there enough for the amount of people 
that are doing it for sure.

1672
01:17:11,630 --> 01:17:12,463
Definitely it's a very sustainable,
but that's also why it's really 

1673
01:17:15,531 --> 01:17:16,364
difficult to get certain tags for 
certain animals in certain areas where 

1674
01:17:19,791 --> 01:17:22,220
they do monitor the population and they 
say,

1675
01:17:22,221 --> 01:17:24,140
well we have like a certain amount here,
this is a,

1676
01:17:24,470 --> 01:17:25,303
this is the amount that we have and this
is the amount that we think would be 

1677
01:17:27,171 --> 01:17:28,004
healthy to removed from the population 
because of the competition for food and 

1678
01:17:30,921 --> 01:17:32,610
this and that and,
and you know,

1679
01:17:32,770 --> 01:17:35,060
so these people compete for not to 
compete,

1680
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:39,190
but they put it in there for like the 
apply for a tag,

1681
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:41,600
like a lottery system.
It might be a thousand people apply,

1682
01:17:41,601 --> 01:17:42,434
but only 100 get tags and now those 100,
most of the time it's not even 50 

1683
01:17:46,941 --> 01:17:47,774
percent success rate.
So these are the proposition of going 

1684
01:17:50,751 --> 01:17:52,260
out and just trying to get your own 
meats.

1685
01:17:52,700 --> 01:17:54,260
Very sketchy.
It's very hard to do.

1686
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:55,880
Not everybody could do it.
So it's not,

1687
01:17:55,910 --> 01:17:59,750
it's not really a viable alternative to 
feeding 350 million people.

1688
01:17:59,780 --> 01:18:01,490
No,
but it could be viable for you.

1689
01:18:01,870 --> 01:18:06,170
And I feel like that's the thing about 
people when it comes to impact.

1690
01:18:06,171 --> 01:18:07,610
We always,
we have this weird thing,

1691
01:18:07,611 --> 01:18:08,444
we're go,
well,

1692
01:18:08,660 --> 01:18:10,430
everybody can't do that.
You're right.

1693
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:11,353
Everybody can do that.
Everybody can't live in your house 

1694
01:18:12,651 --> 01:18:13,430
either,
right?

1695
01:18:13,430 --> 01:18:15,800
Everybody doesn't want to do that.
Everybody can't sleep in your bed.

1696
01:18:15,990 --> 01:18:16,823
Every.
Everybody can't fuck your wife unless 

1697
01:18:17,811 --> 01:18:19,520
you guys would like that,
unless your brakes,

1698
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:21,073
you know,
it's like there's a certain amount of 

1699
01:18:22,971 --> 01:18:26,080
shit you can think of for your own life,
like for your own life.

1700
01:18:26,090 --> 01:18:28,220
You want to feel better?
Go shoot a wild pig.

1701
01:18:28,670 --> 01:18:30,560
That's where you get your food.
You'll feel better.

1702
01:18:30,730 --> 01:18:31,970
You'll feel weird.
You.

1703
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:33,433
Michael Pollan wrote a very interesting 
essay about him shooting a wild pig up 

1704
01:18:37,221 --> 01:18:37,830
in sonoma.

1705
01:18:37,830 --> 01:18:38,663
It's,
I think it's included in the Omnivore's 

1706
01:18:40,101 --> 01:18:40,934
dilemma,
his big best seller where he wanted to 

1707
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:46,880
trace the origins of everything,
every element of a meal.

1708
01:18:46,940 --> 01:18:49,280
And so he built a book around that.
But he,

1709
01:18:49,580 --> 01:18:52,610
I remember reading that essay in the New
Yorker,

1710
01:18:52,611 --> 01:18:54,440
I think.
And um,

1711
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:59,800
I was struck by how he,
he conveys really powerfully the feeling

1712
01:18:59,901 --> 01:19:00,734
of having killed something where there 
was this sort of jubilation followed by 

1713
01:19:04,731 --> 01:19:05,564
shame,
followed by like a confusion and 

1714
01:19:09,081 --> 01:19:13,480
discussed and like all these things were
sort of waves passing through him.

1715
01:19:13,820 --> 01:19:15,860
You know,
he wasn't a big hunter.

1716
01:19:15,861 --> 01:19:17,780
He just wanted to have this one 
experience.

1717
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:19,370
Right.
And uh,

1718
01:19:19,820 --> 01:19:21,680
yeah,
it's my buddy,

1719
01:19:21,681 --> 01:19:25,730
Justin's gonna take me hunting.
He's been offering for a couple of years

1720
01:19:25,731 --> 01:19:27,950
now and I want to do it.
I'm not a big killer,

1721
01:19:27,951 --> 01:19:28,784
but I know how to shoot guns and I feel 
some responsibility to face the reality 

1722
01:19:33,471 --> 01:19:34,760
of meat,
you know?

1723
01:19:34,790 --> 01:19:37,550
I mean just face it,
you're killing shit,

1724
01:19:37,580 --> 01:19:38,413
you know,
and just because someone's doing it for 

1725
01:19:39,231 --> 01:19:42,530
you in a factory and cutting it up and 
putting it in plastic,

1726
01:19:42,950 --> 01:19:45,380
that doesn't mean you're not involved in
that process.

1727
01:19:45,410 --> 01:19:49,160
Would you be one of the people that 
would adopt lab created meat?

1728
01:19:49,370 --> 01:19:51,590
Would you put that in your diet once 
that,

1729
01:19:51,670 --> 01:19:52,503
that actually happens because they're 
pretty sure that they're going to be 

1730
01:19:54,291 --> 01:19:58,250
able to make that happen soon?
Or would you look at it and say,

1731
01:19:58,400 --> 01:19:58,701
well,
I mean,

1732
01:19:58,701 --> 01:19:59,534
how would you look at it?
I'd want to look at it scientifically 

1733
01:20:01,941 --> 01:20:02,750
and no,
you know,

1734
01:20:02,750 --> 01:20:03,583
what's the nutritional content?
Because I'm very suspicious of these 

1735
01:20:07,201 --> 01:20:08,480
things that come out of laboratory.

1736
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:11,880
Yeah.
But if it turned out that it was,

1737
01:20:12,150 --> 01:20:12,983
it tasted the same,
the nutritional content was as good as 

1738
01:20:15,151 --> 01:20:16,130
wild,
you know,

1739
01:20:16,650 --> 01:20:19,620
meet with grass Fed Omega three and all 
that kind of stuff.

1740
01:20:19,621 --> 01:20:21,930
They Omega three,
Omega six ratios were right?

1741
01:20:22,980 --> 01:20:23,930
Yeah,
I'd eat it.

1742
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:27,060
Why not?
I eat a lot of weird shit and we all do.

1743
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:28,980
Or most of us,
you know,

1744
01:20:29,010 --> 01:20:33,060
I would definitely try it.
My mother had a bowl of cheese puffs the

1745
01:20:33,061 --> 01:20:35,570
other day at the superbowl.
What the fuck is a cheese puff?

1746
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:37,193
Asshole fire talk.
Something that comes out of a lab or 

1747
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:45,000
marshmallows when they have banned trans
fats in the United States,

1748
01:20:45,001 --> 01:20:45,834
but they allow people to put them in for
the next couple of years in 2018 runs 

1749
01:20:50,611 --> 01:20:54,360
out.
So until then you could poison people.

1750
01:20:54,780 --> 01:20:55,613
Until then you can keep throwing that 
stuff and whatever the fuck baked goods 

1751
01:20:58,591 --> 01:20:59,424
and Taito creations.
What did we find out the Trans fats are 

1752
01:21:03,091 --> 01:21:03,210
in?

1753
01:21:03,210 --> 01:21:05,570
It was in like microwave popcorn I think
was one.

1754
01:21:05,610 --> 01:21:07,860
That's crazy.
That stuff's God damn delicious.

1755
01:21:07,910 --> 01:21:08,743
Yeah,
I'd love microwave popcorn and what do 

1756
01:21:09,991 --> 01:21:11,440
you need to make popcorn?
It's not.

1757
01:21:11,660 --> 01:21:14,250
I mean just make it normally a little 
oil.

1758
01:21:14,280 --> 01:21:16,290
I know,
but it's so convenient.

1759
01:21:16,380 --> 01:21:20,660
If you're a lazy fuck,
it's the stockpiles you can do,

1760
01:21:20,661 --> 01:21:24,610
you know,
the whole sort of fertilizer and I'm not

1761
01:21:24,690 --> 01:21:28,200
fertilizer pesticide,
insecticide and you know,

1762
01:21:28,290 --> 01:21:29,123
farm spraying crops and all that shit.
That all started because at the end of 

1763
01:21:32,941 --> 01:21:36,840
World War II there were huge stockpiles 
of chemical weapons that weren't used.

1764
01:21:37,190 --> 01:21:39,750
And so they're like,
what are we going to do with this shit?

1765
01:21:39,751 --> 01:21:42,540
We gotta sell this shit.
And they were like,

1766
01:21:42,541 --> 01:21:46,420
well we can dilute it and spray it and 
it'll kill aphids or whatever the fuck.

1767
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:47,633
And there really wasn't a big problem 
with pests in the American farming 

1768
01:21:50,491 --> 01:21:51,324
industry,
but they had all the stock pile of 

1769
01:21:53,131 --> 01:21:53,490
stuff.

1770
01:21:53,490 --> 01:21:56,220
And the Rachel Carson writes about this 
in silent spring.

1771
01:21:56,410 --> 01:21:58,740
A classic book.
Yeah.

1772
01:21:58,770 --> 01:22:01,920
Crazy.
So it's like there's bacon and eggs.

1773
01:22:02,610 --> 01:22:03,443
We think that's a natural breakfast 
thing that was invented by an 

1774
01:22:05,641 --> 01:22:06,770
advertising agency.
Yeah.

1775
01:22:06,790 --> 01:22:08,460
We talked about this before.
Anyway.

1776
01:22:08,550 --> 01:22:09,383
Yeah.
We talked about this and we've talked 

1777
01:22:10,051 --> 01:22:13,920
about how Kellogg's created really blend
cereal to keep people from beating off.

1778
01:22:14,010 --> 01:22:14,940
See,
that's my shtick.

1779
01:22:14,941 --> 01:22:16,680
Right.
That's a beautiful stick though.

1780
01:22:16,980 --> 01:22:18,750
Once people find out that's true.
You're like,

1781
01:22:18,751 --> 01:22:19,584
what?
Just think of how bizarre Graham 

1782
01:22:21,751 --> 01:22:25,410
crackers Graham crackers again.
Again,

1783
01:22:25,411 --> 01:22:26,244
it was current.
Graham and Kellogg were the two sort of 

1784
01:22:28,291 --> 01:22:29,124
anti masturbation guy and he thought 
Graham crackers keep you from being off 

1785
01:22:31,650 --> 01:22:33,690
because they're so blend.
That's hilarious.

1786
01:22:34,170 --> 01:22:36,750
Isn't it hilarious that they associated 
spicy food,

1787
01:22:36,751 --> 01:22:41,751
like Latino's dance?
They had tacos.

1788
01:22:41,941 --> 01:22:43,790
We had to tell about the Taco.
Yeah,

1789
01:22:43,860 --> 01:22:46,590
some fucking hot salsa.
Salsa music.

1790
01:22:47,590 --> 01:22:48,423
Getting crazy.

1791
01:22:48,450 --> 01:22:51,080
You always associate salsa music with a 
woman with like a dress.

1792
01:22:51,090 --> 01:22:52,800
It's like slit up the side.
Um,

1793
01:22:52,810 --> 01:22:54,480
and the way up to her hip.
See,

1794
01:22:54,481 --> 01:22:55,314
I wish if I were efficient like you,
I would have learned to salsa dance 

1795
01:22:57,760 --> 01:22:59,160
years ago.
I'm not that efficient.

1796
01:22:59,250 --> 01:23:04,250
I don't see.
I can't even ice skate in your head.

1797
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:06,843
There's salsa dancing and then right 
next to it on the shelf is ice skating 

1798
01:23:10,610 --> 01:23:12,850
seems to be something that a lot of 
people know how to do.

1799
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:16,590
Not a lot of Mexicans.
That's true of African ice skaters.

1800
01:23:16,750 --> 01:23:17,990
Right.
That's what black people have,

1801
01:23:17,991 --> 01:23:20,440
haven't dominated hockey otherwise.
Able to take it over.

1802
01:23:20,441 --> 01:23:21,274
That shit too.
I'm coming because ice skating like a 

1803
01:23:24,791 --> 01:23:25,860
fucking never learned.
Yeah.

1804
01:23:25,870 --> 01:23:27,420
I can ice skate,
you know,

1805
01:23:27,430 --> 01:23:30,510
I feel good now.
My kids can but can.

1806
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:34,180
But like to me the sexiest women or the 
women who were salsa dancing,

1807
01:23:34,460 --> 01:23:36,540
you know,
like sweaty,

1808
01:23:37,330 --> 01:23:38,163
you know,
move the way they move and it's all 

1809
01:23:40,331 --> 01:23:41,164
like,
well it's a party and I just love to be 

1810
01:23:42,971 --> 01:23:43,900
out there on the floor.

1811
01:23:43,900 --> 01:23:46,640
Mr Coolguy a light colored suit,
you know?

1812
01:23:46,660 --> 01:23:47,740
Yeah.
Like Miami Vice.

1813
01:23:47,741 --> 01:23:48,491
Yeah,
exactly.

1814
01:23:48,491 --> 01:23:49,324
That's what I'm picturing.
But first no socks you doing in my 

1815
01:23:52,211 --> 01:23:56,830
dreams.
That's me problem with loafers.

1816
01:23:56,831 --> 01:23:59,470
No socks.
They could really stink after a while.

1817
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:01,710
Right.
You can get your fetal sweat and air and

1818
01:24:01,711 --> 01:24:04,000
it's disgusting and it's not as much.
Yeah,

1819
01:24:04,001 --> 01:24:04,780
it's gross.
Yeah.

1820
01:24:04,780 --> 01:24:05,613
I don't know.
I'm lucky in that respect or I'm just 

1821
01:24:07,361 --> 01:24:09,500
totally diluted,
but I think I.

1822
01:24:09,590 --> 01:24:14,590
I think my body does instinct much,
but I may be wrong about that.

1823
01:24:16,241 --> 01:24:18,340
I may just have really friendly people 
around.

1824
01:24:19,570 --> 01:24:21,610
Well,
you know how olfactory senses work,

1825
01:24:21,611 --> 01:24:23,980
right?
They work on change.

1826
01:24:24,610 --> 01:24:27,820
They don't work on.
You don't recognize like distinct smells

1827
01:24:27,821 --> 01:24:28,654
that last,
like a say if you're living in an area 

1828
01:24:31,391 --> 01:24:33,250
that stinks.
You know how people used to.

1829
01:24:33,251 --> 01:24:34,530
The smell of baby shit.
Yeah.

1830
01:24:34,830 --> 01:24:35,663
Oh No.
Not necessarily because baby shit's not 

1831
01:24:37,451 --> 01:24:38,284
in front of you all the time,
but things that are around you all the 

1832
01:24:40,151 --> 01:24:40,984
time,
like your own funk or how your house 

1833
01:24:41,981 --> 01:24:42,930
smells,
your.

1834
01:24:42,970 --> 01:24:44,970
You become immune to it.
Unless there's like,

1835
01:24:45,310 --> 01:24:46,143
like if you have a house,
like if you're at a cat pissing your 

1836
01:24:47,321 --> 01:24:50,060
house,
fucking my friend in bed.

1837
01:24:50,120 --> 01:24:52,750
Do you like walking around?
Like where the fuck is it?

1838
01:24:52,780 --> 01:24:53,613
Now I'm walking around like a God damn 
dog trying to find out where my cat 

1839
01:24:55,631 --> 01:24:56,464
pissed,
especially when I used to have a carpet 

1840
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:01,450
grows because you never knew where they 
pissed and then you never really totally

1841
01:25:01,451 --> 01:25:03,760
got it out of there and then they know 
you never got it out of there.

1842
01:25:03,761 --> 01:25:08,761
So they find that spot piano and again,
wretched a cat in college.

1843
01:25:12,460 --> 01:25:17,040
I'd moved into this shared apartment 
with this woman and uh,

1844
01:25:17,830 --> 01:25:20,680
she had this cat named Michael who was 
beautiful cat,

1845
01:25:20,710 --> 01:25:23,590
big,
big sort of whiskers and just a lovely,

1846
01:25:23,591 --> 01:25:26,350
beautiful of communism.
I don't know,

1847
01:25:26,351 --> 01:25:27,184
I think it was more like a thing,
but the cat would like get on a table 

1848
01:25:30,521 --> 01:25:31,354
and he put his paws on your shoulders 
and just rub his face and your face and 

1849
01:25:34,301 --> 01:25:34,991
you'd be like,
oh,

1850
01:25:34,991 --> 01:25:35,890
what a great cat.

1851
01:25:35,890 --> 01:25:36,723
And then he would just freak out and 
like fucking face and scratchy and run 

1852
01:25:41,731 --> 01:25:42,370
away.
Like,

1853
01:25:42,370 --> 01:25:43,990
oh,
this cat fucked right.

1854
01:25:44,020 --> 01:25:47,080
Probably got acid.
Somebody fucking massive.

1855
01:25:47,081 --> 01:25:47,920
I think.
Yeah,

1856
01:25:47,921 --> 01:25:48,754
because it was one of these hippie 
houses where people are moving through 

1857
01:25:51,101 --> 01:25:53,330
all the time,
fucking hippies.

1858
01:25:53,620 --> 01:25:56,680
Anyway,
so I ended up hooking up with this woman

1859
01:25:57,840 --> 01:25:58,673
and I remember one time we were in my 
bed and we're having sex and the cat 

1860
01:26:01,901 --> 01:26:06,901
walks in and he looks at me and he backs
up to my bookshelf and just show my love

1861
01:26:09,100 --> 01:26:12,150
for my well holding eye contact with me.
Oh,

1862
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:13,990
that's disturbing.
Uh,

1863
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,430
I think he had a thing with this woman 
and I was.

1864
01:26:16,790 --> 01:26:17,421
Oh,
for sure.

1865
01:26:17,421 --> 01:26:18,254
Yeah.
Just getting with her because he's 

1866
01:26:19,191 --> 01:26:20,360
probably,
if he's spraying,

1867
01:26:20,361 --> 01:26:21,470
it's probably not fixed.
Right.

1868
01:26:21,650 --> 01:26:22,770
It wasn't fixed.
You cannot.

1869
01:26:23,060 --> 01:26:23,893
First of all,
you got to fix those cats because when 

1870
01:26:25,730 --> 01:26:28,880
they walk in on you fucking they're 
going to get horny if freaks.

1871
01:26:28,950 --> 01:26:31,350
Yeah.
Especially male cats that don't,

1872
01:26:31,380 --> 01:26:33,080
they don't get fixed.
They all spray.

1873
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:34,393
All of them mean female cats.
They get into heat and they start 

1874
01:26:36,181 --> 01:26:41,060
mowing,
sticking their ass up in the air.

1875
01:26:41,170 --> 01:26:42,003
Yeah.
I told the story about my sexual 

1876
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:46,520
experience to see the animation.
That guy did it that.

1877
01:26:46,610 --> 01:26:47,390
No,
I didn't.

1878
01:26:47,390 --> 01:26:48,320
Who did it?
Which guy?

1879
01:26:49,330 --> 01:26:50,360
Name?
But it's,

1880
01:26:50,450 --> 01:26:54,020
it's on youtube and it is.
So polly polly,

1881
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:58,040
it's an animator in in Peru and he wrote
to me,

1882
01:26:58,041 --> 01:27:00,350
he's,
he's not Peruvian but he's based there,

1883
01:27:00,750 --> 01:27:02,210
but he wrote to me and he's like,
hey man,

1884
01:27:02,211 --> 01:27:04,500
would you mind if I did an animation of 
some store,

1885
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:06,290
a story you tell in your podcast?
I was like,

1886
01:27:06,291 --> 01:27:06,921
yeah,
go ahead.

1887
01:27:06,921 --> 01:27:08,660
That's great.
You don't need my permission.

1888
01:27:08,661 --> 01:27:09,494
Right.
But he picked the one of me and you and 

1889
01:27:12,201 --> 01:27:13,034
Duncan and I'm telling the story about 
this cat and the pencil and the cats up 

1890
01:27:16,821 --> 01:27:17,990
in the pencil and all this shit.

1891
01:27:18,580 --> 01:27:19,131
It's like,
dude,

1892
01:27:19,131 --> 01:27:22,100
you pick the one story like I don't 
really want the world.

1893
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:26,180
Like the Joe Rogan audience will get it.
My audience will get it,

1894
01:27:26,780 --> 01:27:31,250
but I don't know that like twitter 
universe is gonna get it.

1895
01:27:31,790 --> 01:27:33,770
So I feel bad because he put a lot of 
work into it,

1896
01:27:33,771 --> 01:27:36,140
but I haven't really pushed to promote 
it much.

1897
01:27:37,050 --> 01:27:38,950
But it's really what you're saying.
But I think your,

1898
01:27:38,990 --> 01:27:42,440
your fears are unfounded to think.
So that's the fuck the people don't have

1899
01:27:42,470 --> 01:27:44,000
you come across.
You're hilarious.

1900
01:27:44,001 --> 01:27:45,650
And the Jamie,
if you could find this thing.

1901
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:50,420
It's called A.
It's on my youtube channel.

1902
01:27:50,470 --> 01:27:51,303
I remember the story.
It's something about if you just Google 

1903
01:27:54,260 --> 01:27:58,340
Christopher Ryan fucks a cab with a 
pencil or does it?

1904
01:27:58,370 --> 01:28:00,910
I'd love to see what else.
We had a catalyst and he,

1905
01:28:00,980 --> 01:28:03,290
before she got fixed,
we've got to fix like right when she got

1906
01:28:03,291 --> 01:28:03,620
into heat.

1907
01:28:03,620 --> 01:28:04,890
But when you had pet her and she was 
like,

1908
01:28:04,910 --> 01:28:05,743
lift her ass up in the air.
Just like as soon as you give her any 

1909
01:28:09,141 --> 01:28:13,280
affection and then it'll be spanker they
love to get spanked to Jesus Christ.

1910
01:28:13,340 --> 01:28:15,350
Yeah.
I had a cat who would hold onto the sofa

1911
01:28:15,351 --> 01:28:19,100
and I'd spank or God.
And then I'd like fake spanker and she'd

1912
01:28:19,101 --> 01:28:21,800
fall off because she was already 
compensating for it.

1913
01:28:23,740 --> 01:28:24,573
God.
So you were like beating her off by 

1914
01:28:25,701 --> 01:28:28,440
spanking or you know,
I basically write,

1915
01:28:28,550 --> 01:28:29,383
I like to give animals pleasure.
And normally the way that expresses 

1916
01:28:33,531 --> 01:28:34,700
itself,
like in Spain,

1917
01:28:34,701 --> 01:28:35,534
in our apartment in span,
I built this whole cat world like I 

1918
01:28:38,250 --> 01:28:39,083
built.
I got this big piece of driftwood and I 

1919
01:28:41,061 --> 01:28:41,894
wrapped.
I'm climbing rope around it so they can 

1920
01:28:43,461 --> 01:28:44,294
climb straight up this thing and then 
there's a series of shelves along the 

1921
01:28:47,241 --> 01:28:48,074
ceiling so they jump around and they can
go all around the room and chase each 

1922
01:28:50,571 --> 01:28:52,400
other and hang out up there.

1923
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:53,233
When you're having a party,
they're like up there just hanging out 

1924
01:28:54,741 --> 01:28:57,020
watching people and because they're,
you know,

1925
01:28:57,021 --> 01:28:58,530
that's where they want to be.
Right.

1926
01:28:58,760 --> 01:29:01,130
And then on the terrorist I built this 
big tree thing,

1927
01:29:01,260 --> 01:29:02,093
they go on and there's a hammock in it 
and the cats get in the hammock and 

1928
01:29:04,801 --> 01:29:08,820
swimming.
And so I love seeing the animals happy,

1929
01:29:09,220 --> 01:29:12,750
you know?
I mean maybe in a way my whole,

1930
01:29:12,780 --> 01:29:13,613
my,
the things I write are trying to make 

1931
01:29:14,791 --> 01:29:15,624
people happy because what I'm trying to 
do is get people in their natural 

1932
01:29:17,941 --> 01:29:19,440
environment.
That's what I'm trying.

1933
01:29:19,441 --> 01:29:20,730
This one I'm writing about,
you know.

1934
01:29:21,660 --> 01:29:23,850
And so with cats it's the same way I 
want them to be.

1935
01:29:23,851 --> 01:29:26,470
I want them to.
I want to create a jungle for them and a

1936
01:29:26,471 --> 01:29:27,304
world.
And it's so cool because we had three 

1937
01:29:28,951 --> 01:29:31,890
cats and they,
once you build this world for them,

1938
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:34,080
they leave you alone.
They're not like.

1939
01:29:34,380 --> 01:29:35,880
People think cats are like,
ah,

1940
01:29:35,881 --> 01:29:37,110
you know,
it's all pathetic.

1941
01:29:37,111 --> 01:29:37,591
It's,
you know,

1942
01:29:37,591 --> 01:29:41,160
I come home and we ain't me man.
If you have three cats,

1943
01:29:41,550 --> 01:29:44,760
they have their own life and they're 
happy to interact with you when you went

1944
01:29:44,761 --> 01:29:45,780
to.
But when you don't want to,

1945
01:29:45,781 --> 01:29:47,310
they're doing their thing,
you know?

1946
01:29:47,810 --> 01:29:50,400
It was really.
It's really good.

1947
01:29:50,460 --> 01:29:51,740
Alright.
Jamie arthritis there.

1948
01:29:51,750 --> 01:29:53,220
Interesting little animals,
man.

1949
01:29:53,340 --> 01:29:55,560
I love the relationships that people 
have with their cats.

1950
01:29:55,561 --> 01:29:56,880
It's very.
Okay.

1951
01:29:56,881 --> 01:29:57,830
Here we go.
What is that?

1952
01:30:01,650 --> 01:30:02,550
Well,
don't,

1953
01:30:02,551 --> 01:30:05,760
don't watch the whole thing.
This one's got like a laugh track on it.

1954
01:30:06,470 --> 01:30:08,210
Oh No,
no,

1955
01:30:08,220 --> 01:30:09,090
no.
The laugh track.

1956
01:30:09,091 --> 01:30:11,430
He added that.
That's because I was talking about doing

1957
01:30:11,431 --> 01:30:13,120
this Gig in Hollywood.
Oh,

1958
01:30:13,121 --> 01:30:15,780
okay.
It's called a nine and a half lives with

1959
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:18,910
Dr Christopher Ryan.
Why is it not?

1960
01:30:19,170 --> 01:30:20,850
But you should see the image of you 
though.

1961
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:23,850
You're sitting just like this.
There you go.

1962
01:30:26,100 --> 01:30:27,030
Let's hear some of it.

1963
01:30:28,470 --> 01:30:33,470
I'm eight years old.
It's the seventies and a bridge party at

1964
01:30:35,131 --> 01:30:37,170
their friend's place in it.
So there's no babysitter.

1965
01:30:37,171 --> 01:30:42,171
They take a station wagon and love 
American style,

1966
01:30:42,511 --> 01:30:43,344
the Brady bunch those days,
if anyone's old enough to remember that 

1967
01:30:45,691 --> 01:30:46,411
shit.
Anyway.

1968
01:30:46,411 --> 01:30:47,270
So I'm like,
Hey,

1969
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:48,233
they put me in the basement in the 
family room and they say keep the door 

1970
01:30:51,571 --> 01:30:54,010
closed because the cats in heat,
right.

1971
01:30:55,100 --> 01:30:56,850
That means,
I think it means the cat part.

1972
01:30:56,880 --> 01:30:59,040
So they've got the AC on,
keep the door closed.

1973
01:30:59,041 --> 01:31:02,780
I don't know.
So I go down and watching TV and this is

1974
01:31:02,790 --> 01:31:03,623
just like all over the place,
rubbing her ass on my leg and just like 

1975
01:31:07,860 --> 01:31:09,450
looking at me and she's like,
really?

1976
01:31:09,490 --> 01:31:11,580
Because somebody scratched my itch,
you know?

1977
01:31:12,150 --> 01:31:16,050
And I looked down and there's this 
pencil on the table next to the sofa.

1978
01:31:16,140 --> 01:31:16,973
Oh No,
you did take the pencil and with the 

1979
01:31:19,291 --> 01:31:21,090
eraser down,
I just hold it there.

1980
01:31:21,091 --> 01:31:23,140
Right.
And this cat backs up on this.

1981
01:31:23,250 --> 01:31:28,020
So it starts fucking humping.
Reached me out the inside of her.

1982
01:31:28,021 --> 01:31:30,030
Apart with the metal casing.
No,

1983
01:31:30,031 --> 01:31:30,960
no,
but you know what?

1984
01:31:30,961 --> 01:31:35,961
Male cat penises have spine that come 
out on when the withdrawal that does rip

1985
01:31:37,831 --> 01:31:42,831
up the inside of the female blood has to
mix with catsimatidis fertilized staff.

1986
01:31:45,540 --> 01:31:46,373
What happened was the pencil away 
because it was freaking me out and then 

1987
01:31:51,080 --> 01:31:53,640
turns around and looks at me like,
Yo,

1988
01:31:53,641 --> 01:31:54,181
what?
Hey,

1989
01:31:54,181 --> 01:31:57,210
what are you doing that got to come on.
And like,

1990
01:31:57,280 --> 01:31:59,770
like really like shocked and 
disappointed.

1991
01:32:00,200 --> 01:32:01,033
I was like Whoa.
So I put it back down again and the cab 

1992
01:32:02,711 --> 01:32:06,850
backs up when it starts fucking this 
pencil again and this time I hold on and

1993
01:32:06,851 --> 01:32:07,684
then she comes and she's a forecast and 
she like rolls over and looks at me 

1994
01:32:13,130 --> 01:32:16,300
looking at her face and it looks at me 
with love and gratitude.

1995
01:32:16,930 --> 01:32:17,763
First sexual experience I ever had.
You didn't put your penis against the 

1996
01:32:22,150 --> 01:32:25,090
cab was eight years old?
I wasn't.

1997
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:30,040
I was experiencing it as an idea.
I wasn't feeling it as a sexual thing.

1998
01:32:30,440 --> 01:32:31,273
You?
Yeah.

1999
01:32:31,780 --> 01:32:33,280
Yeah.
When you were a kid,

2000
01:32:33,310 --> 01:32:34,143
but I could see that.
Oh I fucked every cat in the 

2001
01:32:36,371 --> 01:32:37,730
neighborhood.
Did you?

2002
01:32:39,940 --> 01:32:44,940
Is that good to Dave Anderson?
Blood sausage.co

2003
01:32:45,941 --> 01:32:46,890
dot UK.
What?

2004
01:32:46,891 --> 01:32:49,320
Uh,
he's great animations,

2005
01:32:49,330 --> 01:32:50,800
amazing.
Perfect.

2006
01:32:50,890 --> 01:32:52,690
I mean,
I've probably seen it 20 times and every

2007
01:32:52,691 --> 01:32:53,524
time I see details,
if you freeze that frame of the Brady 

2008
01:32:57,280 --> 01:32:58,113
Bunch or love American style or whatever
it was like every one of those 

2009
01:33:00,431 --> 01:33:01,264
characters.
And I'd love to know how accurate his 

2010
01:33:03,311 --> 01:33:04,144
tattoo is of your arm.
And do you have a tee shirt that says 

2011
01:33:07,901 --> 01:33:09,160
how dare you?
No,

2012
01:33:09,161 --> 01:33:13,570
I don't.
It's just a phrase he used to say it all

2013
01:33:13,571 --> 01:33:16,450
the time.
I don't think the tattoos were accurate.

2014
01:33:16,510 --> 01:33:18,130
I didn't recognize him,
but whatever.

2015
01:33:18,131 --> 01:33:18,964
It was amazing.
The Duncan thing with little pyramid 

2016
01:33:21,011 --> 01:33:21,844
with the floating high above it,
sitting in front of them all the time 

2017
01:33:23,591 --> 01:33:28,240
and he's wearing a syrupy guys.
Great.

2018
01:33:28,900 --> 01:33:31,690
Yeah.
What is definitely not correct.

2019
01:33:32,310 --> 01:33:34,480
But um,
the uh,

2020
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:35,433
the other thing was the car,
how the car was bouncing up and down as 

2021
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:38,800
he was driving and it's got the wood 
siding,

2022
01:33:38,860 --> 01:33:40,370
you know,
it's like he,

2023
01:33:40,450 --> 01:33:41,283
he got the seventies,
everyone's wearing leisure suits and 

2024
01:33:43,660 --> 01:33:44,620
smoking cigarettes.

2025
01:33:44,620 --> 01:33:47,210
A shit is really well done.
Not Matter.

2026
01:33:47,370 --> 01:33:48,580
What the fuck was that?
Oh,

2027
01:33:48,581 --> 01:33:51,340
we're talking about giving cats.
Pleasure making animals.

2028
01:33:51,341 --> 01:33:54,070
Had a buddy of mine who used to jerk off
as rottweiler with his foot.

2029
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:55,233
He used to put his foot on his was dick 
and he would like rub it back and forth 

2030
01:33:58,391 --> 01:34:00,830
and rottweiler would come.
And uh,

2031
01:34:01,300 --> 01:34:05,230
I told my girlfriend at the time,
it's a long time ago and she was so mad.

2032
01:34:06,280 --> 01:34:09,370
She was so disgusted like that.
It's fucking disgusting.

2033
01:34:09,400 --> 01:34:10,660
And I'm just like,
why is it disgusting?

2034
01:34:10,661 --> 01:34:12,160
The guys just beaten off his dog,
like,

2035
01:34:12,161 --> 01:34:14,020
the dog can't do it.
The dog could do it.

2036
01:34:14,021 --> 01:34:14,854
He would do it himself.
So he's like a friend talking like his 

2037
01:34:18,731 --> 01:34:21,130
own balls pretty easily.
Uh,

2038
01:34:21,131 --> 01:34:22,030
yeah,
that's true.

2039
01:34:22,031 --> 01:34:24,730
But I don't think that's enough.
I think you needed more.

2040
01:34:25,770 --> 01:34:27,790
So my friend needs to beat them off with
his foot.

2041
01:34:28,070 --> 01:34:32,860
His dog.
I think there's like a female sex toy.

2042
01:34:32,861 --> 01:34:35,380
You can get the dogs.
Oh yeah.

2043
01:34:35,770 --> 01:34:37,660
There's like a thing that,
that makes sense.

2044
01:34:37,661 --> 01:34:39,940
Like a fleshlight for dogs.
That makes sense.

2045
01:34:39,941 --> 01:34:41,740
Keep them from helping your leg.
Yeah.

2046
01:34:41,860 --> 01:34:42,760
Why not?
I mean,

2047
01:34:42,761 --> 01:34:45,490
you want them to be happy.
There was this controversy,

2048
01:34:45,540 --> 01:34:46,930
uh,
not too long ago,

2049
01:34:46,931 --> 01:34:50,280
a woman wrote a book about John Lilly,
Jamie,

2050
01:34:50,290 --> 01:34:51,310
just,
yeah,

2051
01:34:51,311 --> 01:34:53,260
I know what you're talking about.
And you look at this,

2052
01:34:53,261 --> 01:34:54,094
there is a doll to sex doll doll for 
dogs and it's shaped like a dog and you 

2053
01:34:59,181 --> 01:35:02,840
just got to get your horny dog and just 
back them up onto that bitch.

2054
01:35:04,760 --> 01:35:06,500
Wow.
That's hilarious.

2055
01:35:06,501 --> 01:35:10,040
Will push them forward onto that bitch.
Say back the bitch up onto him.

2056
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:11,233
Well,
why don't they just make like a one of 

2057
01:35:12,351 --> 01:35:14,290
them real dolls for a dog?
Give it hair.

2058
01:35:14,300 --> 01:35:15,920
Like the American Werewolf in London out
there.

2059
01:35:16,250 --> 01:35:18,500
Something like that with a dog.
Doesn't feel dirty.

2060
01:35:18,710 --> 01:35:21,260
Like he's got a flux of machine because 
they didn't put any,

2061
01:35:21,650 --> 01:35:26,060
any work whatsoever in the aesthetics.
Do you think the dogs care?

2062
01:35:26,980 --> 01:35:28,700
They might.
It might feel better for them.

2063
01:35:28,850 --> 01:35:30,220
They might get a little more excited if 
fluidly.

2064
01:35:30,221 --> 01:35:32,300
A real dawn.
You could give it like a soundtrack.

2065
01:35:32,301 --> 01:35:37,301
A little while.
Just looking over shoulder please.

2066
01:35:40,011 --> 01:35:41,290
Please don't.

2067
01:35:44,940 --> 01:35:46,330
Uh,
yeah.

2068
01:35:46,370 --> 01:35:48,350
With the woman who jerked off the 
Dolphin.

2069
01:35:48,420 --> 01:35:49,253
Yes.
Well,

2070
01:35:49,670 --> 01:35:50,503
what's fascinating about that story is 
this woman was living with a young 

2071
01:35:54,530 --> 01:35:57,110
adolescent male dolphin in this 
adolescent male.

2072
01:35:57,111 --> 01:35:57,944
Dolphin would.
They were trying to get the dolphin to 

2073
01:35:58,791 --> 01:36:01,370
talk in a flooded house,
flooded house.

2074
01:36:01,371 --> 01:36:02,204
So she lived in a place where she would 
like have waist high water everywhere 

2075
01:36:05,271 --> 01:36:07,400
she went,
so the dolphin could swim freely through

2076
01:36:07,401 --> 01:36:10,640
the house and live with her.
But the dolphin was horny all the time.

2077
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:14,300
So he didn't want to do studies.
So what she did was she beat him off and

2078
01:36:14,301 --> 01:36:16,540
when word got out that she beat off the 
dolphin,

2079
01:36:16,550 --> 01:36:20,520
they canceled all the research is now 
how I thought it.

2080
01:36:20,570 --> 01:36:22,160
The research.
Well,

2081
01:36:22,660 --> 01:36:24,150
they got in trouble,
the gunter,

2082
01:36:24,170 --> 01:36:27,920
but recently because she talked about it
recently when she wrote a book about the

2083
01:36:27,921 --> 01:36:28,754
time I was working with John Lilly who 
run to invent this sensory deprivation 

2084
01:36:32,211 --> 01:36:32,570
tank.

2085
01:36:32,570 --> 01:36:32,910
Well,
no,

2086
01:36:32,910 --> 01:36:33,743
he,
I think he had already been invented it 

2087
01:36:34,520 --> 01:36:35,353
at the time.
He was on like one of the first 

2088
01:36:36,590 --> 01:36:40,400
iterations of it and he was also giving 
assets dolphins.

2089
01:36:40,980 --> 01:36:44,450
So it might've been.
That was one of those things that led to

2090
01:36:44,510 --> 01:36:45,343
them pulling the plug on.
The research is either she was jerking 

2091
01:36:47,091 --> 01:36:49,520
it off and they found out that they were
also.

2092
01:36:49,521 --> 01:36:50,354
I think the Defense Department was using
his research to train dolphins to kill 

2093
01:36:53,750 --> 01:36:58,340
in Vietnam and to plant bombs,
suicide bombs and suicide bombers.

2094
01:36:58,430 --> 01:37:00,620
They would try.
They were training them to suicide bomb,

2095
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:03,980
which is crazy.
It's crazy that they.

2096
01:37:04,150 --> 01:37:06,440
They felt like that was.
Well I guess.

2097
01:37:06,441 --> 01:37:07,800
Look man,
when you were in war,

2098
01:37:08,050 --> 01:37:10,640
you were already deciding that you're 
killing people,

2099
01:37:10,910 --> 01:37:11,743
so the,
the idea of killing dolphins to kill 

2100
01:37:13,071 --> 01:37:13,904
people.
It's like they didn't think of dolphins 

2101
01:37:16,761 --> 01:37:19,550
the way we think of dolphins today,
either like that.

2102
01:37:19,690 --> 01:37:20,523
That might be something that the 
military would still be interested in 

2103
01:37:22,071 --> 01:37:23,090
doing.
I don't know.

2104
01:37:23,091 --> 01:37:25,190
I mean maybe they aren't doing it.
They're just not telling us about it.

2105
01:37:25,191 --> 01:37:27,920
A lot of whales with all their sonar 
testing.

2106
01:37:28,010 --> 01:37:28,843
Yeah,
because they do these intense sound 

2107
01:37:30,591 --> 01:37:35,591
waves in the underwater and the whales 
have very sensitive sound reception.

2108
01:37:35,890 --> 01:37:36,780
Oh,
organize.

2109
01:37:37,030 --> 01:37:40,940
So at fucking blast them and because it 
gives them like tinnitus or some shit,

2110
01:37:41,660 --> 01:37:42,493
like a rock band.
The lead singer of Ac dc can't do shows 

2111
01:37:45,111 --> 01:37:45,944
anymore.
Pete Townsend really can't hear 

2112
01:37:48,651 --> 01:37:50,560
anything.
Pete Townsend's almost deaf too.

2113
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:52,420
In depth for.
Yeah,

2114
01:37:52,430 --> 01:37:55,200
the lead singer of AC DC.
His ears are so fucked up.

2115
01:37:55,201 --> 01:37:56,130
He can't tour anymore.

2116
01:37:57,060 --> 01:37:58,530
Yeah.
I can't go to concerts,

2117
01:37:58,531 --> 01:37:59,280
man.
Like I.

2118
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:02,040
I've been to a few concerts recently.
I mean I never.

2119
01:38:02,041 --> 01:38:02,874
It's not a question of being old.
I hear that getting older noise bothers 

2120
01:38:06,301 --> 01:38:07,134
you more.
But I've always been annoyed by noise 

2121
01:38:09,810 --> 01:38:10,643
and especially where they're playing 
shit so loud that it's distorting the 

2122
01:38:14,101 --> 01:38:16,400
speakers.
It's like year.

2123
01:38:16,440 --> 01:38:17,273
That's not.
That doesn't sound good by being louder 

2124
01:38:19,981 --> 01:38:21,400
is better,
but I don't know.

2125
01:38:21,480 --> 01:38:22,710
That's a weird.
Yeah.

2126
01:38:22,740 --> 01:38:24,510
But there's a thing that people like to 
do.

2127
01:38:24,511 --> 01:38:28,410
They like to know that they're really 
fucking party and man that's it.

2128
01:38:29,420 --> 01:38:30,253
Turn it up to 11 and I think those are 
the people that need to go to the 

2129
01:38:38,461 --> 01:38:39,880
fucking gym.
Heavy bag.

2130
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,310
That's it.
See,

2131
01:38:41,400 --> 01:38:42,233
this is it.
This keys back into me being a lazy 

2132
01:38:43,670 --> 01:38:46,370
Hippie,
like moderate sound,

2133
01:38:46,371 --> 01:38:48,210
but I don't need it to all the way out.

2134
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:50,580
Get something to beat up.
You fucks.

2135
01:38:50,640 --> 01:38:52,380
Yeah.
And stopped it out.

2136
01:38:54,050 --> 01:38:56,560
So you never been to the Salton sea?
No,

2137
01:38:56,570 --> 01:38:58,230
I have not.
But I saw that you were there recently.

2138
01:38:58,231 --> 01:39:00,300
I was a photo.
Yeah.

2139
01:39:00,440 --> 01:39:02,180
It should come out there.
I want to.

2140
01:39:02,190 --> 01:39:05,790
It's an intense post apocalyptic scene 
out to just see the joy.

2141
01:39:05,820 --> 01:39:07,630
It was John Waters to the documentary 
on,

2142
01:39:07,680 --> 01:39:08,630
I believe.
No,

2143
01:39:08,640 --> 01:39:09,473
no,
no.

2144
01:39:09,810 --> 01:39:11,850
There was a scene in,
into the wild where he,

2145
01:39:11,851 --> 01:39:14,280
the kid is there.
Do you remember that?

2146
01:39:14,281 --> 01:39:15,114
He's hanging out with some hippies and 
like a desert that was in the salt and 

2147
01:39:17,911 --> 01:39:18,660
sea.
Yeah.

2148
01:39:18,660 --> 01:39:21,240
He was in slab city,
which is in the solvency.

2149
01:39:21,270 --> 01:39:26,160
Oh yeah.
I've got my buddy towel as a this year.

2150
01:39:26,161 --> 01:39:29,880
Is the second a Bombay beach being 
alley.

2151
01:39:29,940 --> 01:39:31,290
He's doing.
Oh,

2152
01:39:31,291 --> 01:39:33,060
look at that.
That guy.

2153
01:39:33,090 --> 01:39:33,923
Salvation Mountain.
That's that guy that has been making 

2154
01:39:37,051 --> 01:39:38,010
this mountain.

2155
01:39:38,160 --> 01:39:42,640
Yeah.
Out of a art and painting it for years.

2156
01:39:42,650 --> 01:39:45,180
It's all about Jesus and love.
And He,

2157
01:39:45,181 --> 01:39:48,690
uh,
he makes his paint and Straw and mud and

2158
01:39:48,691 --> 01:39:50,250
uh,
he built this whole thing.

2159
01:39:50,630 --> 01:39:52,440
Yeah.
It's crazy structure has been working on

2160
01:39:52,441 --> 01:39:53,470
for decades,
right.

2161
01:39:54,030 --> 01:39:56,140
He died a couple of years ago.
Oh,

2162
01:39:56,400 --> 01:39:59,250
thought is that Kristen Stewart?
Oh yeah,

2163
01:40:00,210 --> 01:40:02,610
yeah.
Her Dad used to be the,

2164
01:40:02,611 --> 01:40:04,590
uh,
one of the,

2165
01:40:04,600 --> 01:40:09,000
the producer guys on fear factor.
He was like,

2166
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:11,820
I don't know what his official title 
was,

2167
01:40:11,821 --> 01:40:14,550
but he was like the guy who got 
everything together,

2168
01:40:14,551 --> 01:40:17,190
like got everybody in place and made 
sure everything was running.

2169
01:40:17,530 --> 01:40:18,870
It was like big job.
Yeah.

2170
01:40:18,900 --> 01:40:22,260
He was like the guy on the street,
like while everything was going on,

2171
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:24,210
really good dude.
Fun Guy.

2172
01:40:24,270 --> 01:40:26,020
Crazy man.
And that's,

2173
01:40:26,021 --> 01:40:27,030
uh,
that's his daughter.

2174
01:40:27,950 --> 01:40:29,020
And I was always like,
dude,

2175
01:40:29,021 --> 01:40:31,410
you shouldn't have your kid act.
She's so young.

2176
01:40:31,650 --> 01:40:33,420
It seems crazy.
So we'll never make it.

2177
01:40:35,360 --> 01:40:36,193
While she was a twilight girl,
seemed like one of the most famous 

2178
01:40:39,121 --> 01:40:42,690
actresses,
but I never saw her until Saturday night

2179
01:40:42,691 --> 01:40:44,580
live a couple of days ago.
Oh really?

2180
01:40:44,590 --> 01:40:45,470
Yeah.
So on,

2181
01:40:45,610 --> 01:40:47,070
like we should do it.
She hosted.

2182
01:40:47,220 --> 01:40:48,360
Oh no kidding.
This last.

2183
01:40:48,390 --> 01:40:49,223
Yeah.
Just got some new movie coming out or 

2184
01:40:50,131 --> 01:40:52,260
something.
I don't know what she was doing.

2185
01:40:52,940 --> 01:40:54,130
Know what she was promoting.

2186
01:40:54,130 --> 01:40:55,930
If anything,
I didn't catch it.

2187
01:40:56,110 --> 01:41:01,030
I just watched it because the scene with
Kathy Bates Doing Sean Spicer.

2188
01:41:01,060 --> 01:41:02,110
Did you see that?
No,

2189
01:41:02,111 --> 01:41:04,540
but I heard it was awesome.
I haven't seen this.

2190
01:41:04,541 --> 01:41:06,350
Meghan McCarthy.
Macarthur.

2191
01:41:06,640 --> 01:41:09,190
Thank you.
I keep saying Kathy Bates,

2192
01:41:09,780 --> 01:41:11,300
it's thing.
It's negative mccarthy.

2193
01:41:11,301 --> 01:41:14,870
It's Melissa Mccarthy Directing your 
current.

2194
01:41:15,310 --> 01:41:16,143
Jamie.
I think that that's show Saturday night 

2195
01:41:17,861 --> 01:41:18,694
live is all the evidence we need.
The Donald Trump needs to do mushrooms 

2196
01:41:21,430 --> 01:41:22,263
because he keeps tweeting about Alec 
Baldwin doing that sketch about them 

2197
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:26,830
saying it's not funny to.
Why are we laughing?

2198
01:41:27,160 --> 01:41:28,810
Tell me what's going on.
Why are we laughing?

2199
01:41:29,020 --> 01:41:31,000
Like if someone shitting on you.
Look,

2200
01:41:31,070 --> 01:41:32,470
it doesn't feel good.
I know.

2201
01:41:32,471 --> 01:41:34,390
It doesn't feel good,
but it is funny.

2202
01:41:34,520 --> 01:41:35,291
Yeah.
You know,

2203
01:41:35,291 --> 01:41:38,260
and Alec Baldwin does do a fucking 
amazing impressionable.

2204
01:41:38,370 --> 01:41:39,970
It's his best work,
right?

2205
01:41:39,971 --> 01:41:42,010
It's right up there with that whole 
fucking closers.

2206
01:41:42,011 --> 01:41:43,330
Get coffee.
Oh,

2207
01:41:43,331 --> 01:41:45,170
a Glengarry Glen Ross.

2208
01:41:45,180 --> 01:41:46,180
Glen Ross.
Yeah.

2209
01:41:46,340 --> 01:41:48,440
Been that rant that he did in that 
movie.

2210
01:41:48,470 --> 01:41:49,990
That's insane.
Fucking epic,

2211
01:41:49,991 --> 01:41:50,640
right?
Yeah,

2212
01:41:50,640 --> 01:41:52,660
I think there's trump impressions right 
up there.

2213
01:41:52,690 --> 01:41:54,010
Yeah,
it's really good.

2214
01:41:54,040 --> 01:41:55,630
It's really good and it's getting 
better.

2215
01:41:56,210 --> 01:41:59,230
The more he does,
he looks more and more like him,

2216
01:41:59,740 --> 01:42:01,060
you know,
what does it say?

2217
01:42:01,061 --> 01:42:01,894
They're bad news for trump side.
I live in the midst of a ratings 

2218
01:42:04,301 --> 01:42:05,740
renaissance.
Of course it is,

2219
01:42:05,741 --> 01:42:08,730
and that's one of the reasons why,
you know,

2220
01:42:08,810 --> 01:42:11,110
the center live is like a show that goes
in cycles,

2221
01:42:11,310 --> 01:42:12,143
you know,
you have these cycles of greatness and 

2222
01:42:13,350 --> 01:42:14,183
then like to try to find themselves,
believe new people struggle a little 

2223
01:42:17,741 --> 01:42:19,270
bit.
There's always something good there,

2224
01:42:19,271 --> 01:42:23,050
but it's almost like a,
it's really,

2225
01:42:23,080 --> 01:42:26,170
it's got to be insanely difficult to 
create a new show every week.

2226
01:42:26,740 --> 01:42:28,210
Insane.
You know,

2227
01:42:29,800 --> 01:42:32,560
dog eat dog environment and even like 
you look,

2228
01:42:32,700 --> 01:42:35,770
if you go back and look at videos from 
the glory days,

2229
01:42:35,771 --> 01:42:36,604
you know,
that Dan Akroyd days and John Belushi 

2230
01:42:38,351 --> 01:42:39,184
and all that,
there was still a lot of filler in 

2231
01:42:40,241 --> 01:42:40,450
there.

2232
01:42:40,450 --> 01:42:40,901
Oh,
for sure.

2233
01:42:40,901 --> 01:42:43,390
You know,
we remember the automatic and you know,

2234
01:42:43,391 --> 01:42:44,590
the good,
the great moments.

2235
01:42:44,591 --> 01:42:46,780
A Samurai John Belushi,
Sandra character.

2236
01:42:47,120 --> 01:42:48,940
Exactly.
You couldn't do that anymore.

2237
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,610
It'd be cultural appropriation that you 
couldn't do.

2238
01:42:51,640 --> 01:42:54,640
You probably couldn't do the.
Were too wild and crazy guys.

2239
01:42:54,641 --> 01:42:56,620
I don't know.
I mean they were right.

2240
01:42:56,830 --> 01:42:57,663
They were white,
but there were definitely foreign 

2241
01:42:58,240 --> 01:43:00,400
because you do more at.
Could you do bar out today?

2242
01:43:01,460 --> 01:43:04,000
I don't know.
I mean it was just a few years ago,

2243
01:43:04,900 --> 01:43:07,270
but it might be different if he tried it
today.

2244
01:43:08,050 --> 01:43:11,370
Incredibly racist and he's like,
oh,

2245
01:43:11,440 --> 01:43:13,600
he's like an Orthodox Jew.
That guy,

2246
01:43:14,200 --> 01:43:16,450
the comedian who does Bora.
Is He really?

2247
01:43:16,451 --> 01:43:18,640
Yeah.
He's like a seriously religious,

2248
01:43:19,240 --> 01:43:20,073
you know,
honors this Shabat and all that kind of 

2249
01:43:22,121 --> 01:43:24,490
stuff.
Serious Jewish practicing Jew.

2250
01:43:24,790 --> 01:43:29,790
I forgot his real name is Ali g to me,
Ali.

2251
01:43:31,030 --> 01:43:34,800
Jesus' best work when he would interview
people and they didn't know who his leg.

2252
01:43:34,810 --> 01:43:37,750
He can't do that anymore.
But when he interviewed me,

2253
01:43:38,170 --> 01:43:41,970
he interviewed a Buzz Aldrin,
explained humor to him.

2254
01:43:42,980 --> 01:43:43,813
That was one of the greatest.
He's explaining humor while he's in the 

2255
01:43:48,911 --> 01:43:50,830
midst of a joke that he doesn't know is

2256
01:43:52,500 --> 01:43:55,490
for buzz or owned.
Yeah.

2257
01:43:55,580 --> 01:43:58,100
But you know who my favorite,
uh,

2258
01:43:58,190 --> 01:44:01,310
one of the few where he wasn't getting 
on with Ralph Nader,

2259
01:44:02,780 --> 01:44:04,640
Ralph Nader just kind of went with him.
Well,

2260
01:44:04,641 --> 01:44:07,910
what happened was,
so allie is doing this whole thing where

2261
01:44:07,911 --> 01:44:10,760
they're talking about the environment 
and global warming and he says,

2262
01:44:10,761 --> 01:44:11,421
well,
but you know,

2263
01:44:11,421 --> 01:44:16,010
isn't a major cause of global warming,
the cow farts.

2264
01:44:16,460 --> 01:44:18,260
And so shouldn't we just,
you know,

2265
01:44:18,590 --> 01:44:21,740
put balloons on cows and you know,
he gets into this whole thing,

2266
01:44:21,741 --> 01:44:22,574
right?
And Ralph Nader is looking at them and 

2267
01:44:23,211 --> 01:44:27,320
you can see when the balloons on the 
cows asses thing comes out.

2268
01:44:27,321 --> 01:44:30,110
Ralph Nader's like I go,
wait a minute.

2269
01:44:30,500 --> 01:44:34,250
And so he just sort of,
when he finished his talk and he says,

2270
01:44:34,251 --> 01:44:34,821
well,
you know,

2271
01:44:34,821 --> 01:44:35,654
scientists have been working on that,
but it's very hard to develop a valve 

2272
01:44:38,961 --> 01:44:40,870
that perfectly fits a cow's ass hole.

2273
01:44:41,740 --> 01:44:45,680
And then it cuts,
cuts.

2274
01:44:45,950 --> 01:44:48,020
And then the next scene,
like after commercial,

2275
01:44:48,021 --> 01:44:48,854
whatever,
you see algae and Ralph Nader wrapping 

2276
01:44:51,021 --> 01:44:52,240
together.
Oh,

2277
01:44:52,250 --> 01:44:53,730
that's hilarious.
Yeah.

2278
01:44:53,950 --> 01:44:55,550
Is a really.
Do one of those with trump.

2279
01:44:56,380 --> 01:45:01,280
But trump walked out on us.
Play this very quick,

2280
01:45:01,290 --> 01:45:02,123
get in trouble,
but are we gonna get in trouble right 

2281
01:45:03,591 --> 01:45:05,390
now.
Hold on.

2282
01:45:05,420 --> 01:45:07,280
What are we doing?
Hold on.

2283
01:45:07,281 --> 01:45:09,170
It's going to do something.
Why are we getting in trouble?

2284
01:45:09,230 --> 01:45:10,063
Well,
we get our shit pulled from youtube all 

2285
01:45:11,511 --> 01:45:13,730
the time.
If it has content in from someone else's

2286
01:45:13,731 --> 01:45:15,080
video.
Oh really?

2287
01:45:15,081 --> 01:45:16,640
Yeah.
You can't even play the audio.

2288
01:45:21,530 --> 01:45:26,530
So what is the problem with ice cream

2289
01:45:33,370 --> 01:45:36,590
and people listening to this audio will 
audio.

2290
01:45:36,591 --> 01:45:38,050
Well,
but youtube people are not.

2291
01:45:38,110 --> 01:45:40,600
So we're,
we're watching this and Donald Trump was

2292
01:45:40,601 --> 01:45:44,080
getting upset at allergy.
People are just hearing silence.

2293
01:45:44,140 --> 01:45:46,210
Let's kill it then.
This is stupid to do it this way.

2294
01:45:46,660 --> 01:45:48,260
And yeah,
it's um,

2295
01:45:48,370 --> 01:45:51,760
whenever someone's content gets played,
like anybody who owns this video,

2296
01:45:51,850 --> 01:45:52,683
we play their video,
we get pulled off of youtube and then 

2297
01:45:55,271 --> 01:45:58,210
what do you do?
You have to go to cut it out,

2298
01:45:58,211 --> 01:45:59,440
put it back up.
Yeah,

2299
01:46:00,160 --> 01:46:02,800
it's a,
I get it.

2300
01:46:03,340 --> 01:46:04,300
I get it.
They want people to.

2301
01:46:04,310 --> 01:46:06,490
But we've always tried to tell people to
go to that video.

2302
01:46:06,491 --> 01:46:08,320
That's it.
You're sending traffic their way.

2303
01:46:08,321 --> 01:46:09,460
Right?
But it's funny.

2304
01:46:09,490 --> 01:46:11,140
Go find it.
Go find it in here.

2305
01:46:11,350 --> 01:46:12,220
Yeah.
That's funny.

2306
01:46:12,221 --> 01:46:13,750
I didn't know Sacha Baron Cohen was 
easy.

2307
01:46:13,751 --> 01:46:16,450
A practicing Orthodox Jew belief.
So yeah.

2308
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:17,633
Yeah,
it is.

2309
01:46:17,880 --> 01:46:20,110
It's interesting because you think of 
comics is,

2310
01:46:21,190 --> 01:46:22,720
do you know other religious comics?

2311
01:46:24,490 --> 01:46:27,700
Because there's an irreverent and 
intellectual irreverence.

2312
01:46:28,300 --> 01:46:30,010
There are a few.
There are a few.

2313
01:46:30,760 --> 01:46:33,160
Um,
Jim Gaffigan's Catholic.

2314
01:46:33,250 --> 01:46:35,740
Oh yeah.
That sort of his shtick.

2315
01:46:35,741 --> 01:46:38,290
Right?
I don't know if it's a shtick.

2316
01:46:38,350 --> 01:46:40,480
I think he's actually a practicing 
Catholic.

2317
01:46:41,230 --> 01:46:42,990
How much of that is legit?
No,

2318
01:46:43,040 --> 01:46:45,190
I mean that's his.
He's sort of identity.

2319
01:46:45,191 --> 01:46:46,400
I don't mean it,
it's just.

2320
01:46:46,420 --> 01:46:49,060
I just mean like he's the family man.
He definitely is.

2321
01:46:49,140 --> 01:46:51,000
Yeah.
What is this?

2322
01:46:51,180 --> 01:46:53,160
Is this him?
Sacha Baron Cohen says,

2323
01:46:53,161 --> 01:46:53,994
I wouldn't say I'm a religious man.
I'm proud of my Jewish identity and 

2324
01:46:57,451 --> 01:46:58,284
there are certain things I do and 
customs I keep tries to keep kosher and 

2325
01:47:03,241 --> 01:47:06,210
attend synagogue about twice a year.
He tries to keep kosher,

2326
01:47:06,240 --> 01:47:08,910
but he's not saying he's really wouldn't
say he's a religious Jew,

2327
01:47:09,510 --> 01:47:11,690
but he tries to keep kosher.
Alright.

2328
01:47:12,020 --> 01:47:12,853
Yeah.
It sounds like he's halfway in one foot 

2329
01:47:14,911 --> 01:47:16,020
in,
one foot out.

2330
01:47:16,040 --> 01:47:16,873
I mean,
you gotta think about the movies he 

2331
01:47:17,941 --> 01:47:18,600
makes.
You can't,

2332
01:47:18,600 --> 01:47:20,880
you can only be so religious and made 
those movies.

2333
01:47:20,890 --> 01:47:21,860
Yeah,
yeah.

2334
01:47:22,740 --> 01:47:23,720
I Dunno.
I,

2335
01:47:23,790 --> 01:47:26,010
this whole thing about comics thinking 
differently.

2336
01:47:26,720 --> 01:47:30,450
A Saturday I was at j Dot Johansen's 
house.

2337
01:47:30,480 --> 01:47:33,420
He does this cajun cooking every 
Christmas.

2338
01:47:34,020 --> 01:47:36,450
And uh,
I was there and there was a guy,

2339
01:47:37,650 --> 01:47:42,650
a Haney Comic Lustiness,
Alan Haney,

2340
01:47:45,450 --> 01:47:48,590
Havey Havey Havey,
uh,

2341
01:47:48,810 --> 01:47:51,180
who I recognize from mad men and,
you know,

2342
01:47:51,270 --> 01:47:53,400
and then since I met him,
I've seen him everywhere.

2343
01:47:53,401 --> 01:47:54,234
He's on that,
a man in the high castle and all these 

2344
01:47:56,730 --> 01:47:57,720
shows.
Anyway,

2345
01:47:57,721 --> 01:48:00,270
so we're there and we're talking and 
we're talking about this thing.

2346
01:48:00,271 --> 01:48:02,340
We're talking about the stan hope by the
way.

2347
01:48:02,400 --> 01:48:03,233
I didn't finish that cliffhanger thing,
but if someone wants to listen to 

2348
01:48:07,201 --> 01:48:09,870
something,
go check those two episodes out.

2349
01:48:09,871 --> 01:48:12,050
Do you go to the names of the episode 
called the cliff cliff hangers?

2350
01:48:12,060 --> 01:48:12,893
Yeah.
Um,

2351
01:48:13,470 --> 01:48:16,020
but it's very intense.
It's very intense.

2352
01:48:16,350 --> 01:48:19,680
Anyway,
so we're talking about this and I said,

2353
01:48:19,760 --> 01:48:21,150
uh,
have you guys seen this movie,

2354
01:48:21,151 --> 01:48:21,984
the aristocrats?
Because it's really about how comics 

2355
01:48:24,421 --> 01:48:25,710
think differently,
you know,

2356
01:48:25,711 --> 01:48:28,080
like how nothing is offensive and 
they're like,

2357
01:48:28,081 --> 01:48:28,500
yeah,
yeah,

2358
01:48:28,500 --> 01:48:30,810
that's a great movie and that really 
gets to it and you know,

2359
01:48:30,811 --> 01:48:31,644
whatever the conversation continues.
So then I go home and a couple of days 

2360
01:48:34,321 --> 01:48:35,154
later I'm sitting there and I had a copy
of the aristocrats and I haven't seen 

2361
01:48:38,161 --> 01:48:39,570
that since it came out and we're going 
to watch it.

2362
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:40,673
So I watched the aristocrats.
They're both in the fucking movie and 

2363
01:48:44,730 --> 01:48:46,630
neither one of them says anything.
Right?

2364
01:48:47,240 --> 01:48:48,073
So it's again,
it's this la thing where everything's 

2365
01:48:49,950 --> 01:48:53,910
the opposite of,
of what I consider normal.

2366
01:48:54,300 --> 01:48:55,133
So in la I thought about this a lot 
because it was so shocking to me that 

2367
01:48:59,040 --> 01:49:00,360
they were just like,
oh yeah,

2368
01:49:00,361 --> 01:49:02,050
it's a great film and then I want you to
like,

2369
01:49:02,580 --> 01:49:03,950
there they are,
right?

2370
01:49:04,080 --> 01:49:05,700
How do you not say,
oh,

2371
01:49:05,701 --> 01:49:08,310
we're in that movie.
How do you not say that?

2372
01:49:08,850 --> 01:49:13,850
It can only be that in la,
like name dropping is so uncool.

2373
01:49:15,690 --> 01:49:20,330
That cool becomes what you don't say.
Yeah,

2374
01:49:21,240 --> 01:49:24,780
that definitely could be it because 
people see famous people all the time in

2375
01:49:24,781 --> 01:49:26,030
la,
so it's like if you're like,

2376
01:49:26,031 --> 01:49:27,870
oh,
he saw Joe Rogan in the supermarket.

2377
01:49:27,871 --> 01:49:28,461
People are like,
yeah,

2378
01:49:28,461 --> 01:49:29,041
yeah,
whatever,

2379
01:49:29,041 --> 01:49:29,874
man.
It could also be that some people don't 

2380
01:49:31,201 --> 01:49:34,410
like talking about their work.
Some people,

2381
01:49:34,470 --> 01:49:35,303
some people avoid talking about 
especially talking about the work of 

2382
01:49:37,930 --> 01:49:40,050
standup when there did not talk to a 
standup.

2383
01:49:40,790 --> 01:49:42,720
Yeah,
that I do that really?

2384
01:49:42,750 --> 01:49:43,630
Yeah.
Yeah.

2385
01:49:43,680 --> 01:49:44,513
So you would just,
you wouldn't mention that you were in 

2386
01:49:46,231 --> 01:49:46,950
the movie.
I,

2387
01:49:46,950 --> 01:49:48,200
I get away with not mentioning

2388
01:49:48,210 --> 01:49:51,810
it.
I might just scared out of their cars.

2389
01:49:51,910 --> 01:49:52,743
I will to you.
I was still a small town boy because to 

2390
01:49:54,911 --> 01:49:57,250
me it's like you're in a movie.
Oh shit man.

2391
01:49:57,790 --> 01:49:58,623
Tell her.
I will certainly tell you that I was in 

2392
01:49:59,831 --> 01:50:01,690
that movie if you brought it up,
but you my friend.

2393
01:50:01,720 --> 01:50:03,580
But if I didn't know you in some Weirdo 
at a party,

2394
01:50:04,180 --> 01:50:07,570
I got to take a chance with that.
Just talking about standup to you.

2395
01:50:08,140 --> 01:50:09,460
Oh yeah.
That's good movie.

2396
01:50:09,970 --> 01:50:10,870
Hey,
look over there.

2397
01:50:10,871 --> 01:50:14,060
Chips and cheese puffs.
My favorite.

2398
01:50:14,110 --> 01:50:16,090
Yeah,
I get cornered sometimes.

2399
01:50:16,120 --> 01:50:16,953
I mean you've been cornered sometimes by
people that just want to ask questions 

2400
01:50:19,271 --> 01:50:20,460
at you,
like they're interviewing you.

2401
01:50:20,780 --> 01:50:21,613
So what's going on with like,
like right now I get a million people 

2402
01:50:24,341 --> 01:50:28,180
that want to corner me and asked me UFC 
questions because UFC just sold for some

2403
01:50:28,660 --> 01:50:31,840
astronomical for billion dollar,
whatever it is figure.

2404
01:50:31,890 --> 01:50:32,940
Right.
And uh,

2405
01:50:33,100 --> 01:50:34,840
so everybody wants to talk to me.
What's it like with the new owners?

2406
01:50:34,841 --> 01:50:36,030
What's the EU?
It was like,

2407
01:50:36,031 --> 01:50:37,910
oh,
gotta go gotta go.

2408
01:50:38,680 --> 01:50:40,710
You become like a,
someone that you're,

2409
01:50:40,790 --> 01:50:44,770
you're instead of having a conversation 
with people like you're interviewing you

2410
01:50:44,850 --> 01:50:45,430
and.
Yeah.

2411
01:50:45,430 --> 01:50:48,610
And it's one on one.
It's not coming out on TV or something.

2412
01:50:48,670 --> 01:50:49,810
Not even that.
It's like,

2413
01:50:49,870 --> 01:50:50,611
I don't,
you know,

2414
01:50:50,611 --> 01:50:55,570
I don't necessarily want to talk about 
my work detail in issues.

2415
01:50:55,571 --> 01:51:00,571
Like what's it like working with my new 
bosses who gives a shit?

2416
01:51:02,090 --> 01:51:05,380
No.
Do you compartmentalize a lot?

2417
01:51:05,410 --> 01:51:06,243
I mean,
is there the UFC part of your life and 

2418
01:51:07,421 --> 01:51:10,690
there's the standup part of your life 
and it has to be the UFC because I don't

2419
01:51:10,691 --> 01:51:11,800
swear.
I very,

2420
01:51:11,801 --> 01:51:14,160
very rarely like say shit or is that 
hard?

2421
01:51:14,710 --> 01:51:15,371
No,
no.

2422
01:51:15,371 --> 01:51:16,600
It's all about her heart.
I just,

2423
01:51:16,601 --> 01:51:17,920
uh,
I just,

2424
01:51:17,980 --> 01:51:18,940
I don't think it's necessary.

2425
01:51:19,310 --> 01:51:20,143
They don't like what I'm doing.
I mean to keep [inaudible] you're used 

2426
01:51:23,111 --> 01:51:25,060
to talking on the podcast.
Is it?

2427
01:51:25,210 --> 01:51:27,270
I don't mean.
Does it bother you?

2428
01:51:28,510 --> 01:51:31,000
Didn't think you meant that even 
difficult?

2429
01:51:31,090 --> 01:51:31,923
No,
it's not difficult because it is a 

2430
01:51:33,041 --> 01:51:33,874
different,
totally different mindset because I'm 

2431
01:51:35,720 --> 01:51:37,670
never trying to be funny.
Like,

2432
01:51:37,870 --> 01:51:40,780
do you remember when like Dennis Miller 
used to host Monday night football?

2433
01:51:40,870 --> 01:51:41,703
Yeah,
he did it for a little bit because he 

2434
01:51:43,891 --> 01:51:44,724
was trying to be funny.
He was cracking jokes intersect and I 

2435
01:51:46,961 --> 01:51:48,790
remember remembering that.
Yeah.

2436
01:51:48,960 --> 01:51:49,793
But I didn't even watch it,
but I remember people were like really 

2437
01:51:51,311 --> 01:51:54,400
pissed at Dennis Miller and I thought 
about it and I was like,

2438
01:51:54,460 --> 01:51:55,293
well,
I don't do that and I'm not gonna do 

2439
01:51:56,741 --> 01:51:58,360
that.
And it's like he,

2440
01:51:58,361 --> 01:51:59,890
you know,
Dennis is a joke writer.

2441
01:51:59,960 --> 01:52:00,850
He's,
he's got,

2442
01:52:00,880 --> 01:52:03,730
he's a joke teller,
I've,

2443
01:52:03,800 --> 01:52:05,050
I have bits,
you know,

2444
01:52:05,051 --> 01:52:07,300
it's kind of a different kind of comedy 
in the first place,

2445
01:52:07,540 --> 01:52:08,373
but then on top of that it's like that 
thing that's going on to me doesn't 

2446
01:52:12,491 --> 01:52:14,550
require much of me.

2447
01:52:14,860 --> 01:52:17,360
What it requires is me to explain 
things.

2448
01:52:17,590 --> 01:52:18,423
That's it.
So it doesn't require personality or 

2449
01:52:20,720 --> 01:52:21,553
flay or senses of humor or a unique 
point of view other than unless I 

2450
01:52:25,481 --> 01:52:26,314
recognize something like a pattern 
that's happening at a fight that allows 

2451
01:52:29,050 --> 01:52:29,883
the people at home to enjoy it more.
And it allows the person who's fighting 

2452
01:52:34,421 --> 01:52:38,740
the two people that are fighting it,
it represents them in an honorable way.

2453
01:52:39,060 --> 01:52:39,893
So that's my goal.
That's all I'm trying to do when I'm 

2454
01:52:41,441 --> 01:52:42,274
there.
I'm just trying to do my best to give 

2455
01:52:44,591 --> 01:52:47,690
justice to what I'm seeing and to do a 
great job with that.

2456
01:52:48,240 --> 01:52:49,850
I don't even,
I'm not into UFC.

2457
01:52:49,851 --> 01:52:52,970
I've started watching it since I've been
hanging out with you,

2458
01:52:53,150 --> 01:52:53,983
you know,
and I've gotten to know some of the 

2459
01:52:55,581 --> 01:52:58,710
personalities and I've watched the whole
Ronda rousey thing and the,

2460
01:52:58,780 --> 01:53:00,590
you know,
this guy,

2461
01:53:00,680 --> 01:53:02,300
Irish guy,
conor mcgregor.

2462
01:53:02,560 --> 01:53:03,960
You fuck.
Yeah.

2463
01:53:04,040 --> 01:53:05,080
Yeah.
So it's,

2464
01:53:05,081 --> 01:53:09,290
it's pretty compelling and I think you 
do a very good job of that.

2465
01:53:09,291 --> 01:53:12,950
Your ego isn't in play at all.
No,

2466
01:53:12,951 --> 01:53:16,400
it can't be just reporting.
Yeah,

2467
01:53:16,401 --> 01:53:18,230
I try as much as possible to stay 
outside of it.

2468
01:53:18,260 --> 01:53:21,050
I mean I'm,
I'm thinking because I want to.

2469
01:53:21,051 --> 01:53:22,910
I mean I'm constantly trying to stay on 
the ball,

2470
01:53:23,330 --> 01:53:25,490
but uh,
at my best I'm just doing it,

2471
01:53:25,520 --> 01:53:28,790
you know,
it's like I have to be just tuned in,

2472
01:53:28,791 --> 01:53:31,010
well rested,
well fed,

2473
01:53:31,340 --> 01:53:32,870
hyped up,
ready to go.

2474
01:53:32,900 --> 01:53:33,733
It's because it's a six hour thing,
so I sit down for six hours and 

2475
01:53:37,610 --> 01:53:41,030
oftentimes it's a,
it's always at least 10 fights.

2476
01:53:41,360 --> 01:53:43,550
It's usually 11 or 12.
You do all?

2477
01:53:43,590 --> 01:53:44,423
Yup.
All of all of them bring you in for the 

2478
01:53:46,790 --> 01:53:47,030
last few?
No,

2479
01:53:47,030 --> 01:53:47,863
actually like doing it that way because 
what happens is I get warmed up so I do 

2480
01:53:50,661 --> 01:53:53,390
like the first one because like 
sometimes fighting so crazy.

2481
01:53:53,390 --> 01:53:54,380
You have to go,
oh yeah,

2482
01:53:54,381 --> 01:53:55,460
okay.
There's a fight going on,

2483
01:53:55,850 --> 01:53:56,780
you know,
like you're sitting in.

2484
01:53:56,781 --> 01:54:00,950
I mean even though I've done it,
I've called at least a thousand fights,

2485
01:54:00,951 --> 01:54:04,360
probably closer to 2005.
I don't know how many actual fights have

2486
01:54:04,361 --> 01:54:06,710
been in front of while doing comedy or 
commentary rather,

2487
01:54:06,711 --> 01:54:07,544
but it's at least a thousand.
Let's say it's probably like 1500 or 

2488
01:54:09,681 --> 01:54:10,514
something,
but even though that's the case to this 

2489
01:54:12,831 --> 01:54:14,180
day,
when one starts,

2490
01:54:14,480 --> 01:54:16,280
I go,
okay,

2491
01:54:16,281 --> 01:54:17,114
this is the fight,
this is what's going on by the fifth 

2492
01:54:18,921 --> 01:54:19,754
fight of the night.
I'm totally in the groove and I'm just 

2493
01:54:22,310 --> 01:54:24,500
laser focused,
concentrated on the action,

2494
01:54:24,501 --> 01:54:25,334
trying to pick the right words,
trying to describe it in the right way 

2495
01:54:27,741 --> 01:54:32,741
and trying to give that,
give that perspective to someone at home

2496
01:54:32,991 --> 01:54:35,130
that might not be seeing something that 
I might be saying.

2497
01:54:35,550 --> 01:54:36,620
Well,
especially all the.

2498
01:54:36,740 --> 01:54:39,350
The wrestling grappling techniques,
that's a big part of it.

2499
01:54:39,560 --> 01:54:40,393
That's a big part of it.
People are used to seeing boxing and 

2500
01:54:42,191 --> 01:54:44,360
they dealt with an upper cut is or a 
book or whatever,

2501
01:54:44,361 --> 01:54:45,920
but yeah,
when they get on the ground,

2502
01:54:45,921 --> 01:54:46,754
I have no idea what's going on.
And you're talking about the arm bar or 

2503
01:54:49,080 --> 01:54:50,570
this and that?
Yeah,

2504
01:54:50,600 --> 01:54:53,420
that's the most difficult.
Are you below the stage or.

2505
01:54:53,490 --> 01:54:57,260
Yeah,
below you see what's going on.

2506
01:54:57,270 --> 01:54:58,280
One hundred percent.
Yeah.

2507
01:54:58,281 --> 01:54:59,114
Yeah.
Well sometimes I don't see like if the 

2508
01:55:00,771 --> 01:55:02,870
referee stands in front of me and then I
have to look at monitoring.

2509
01:55:03,150 --> 01:55:03,983
So I have two monitors in front of me 
and give me two completely different 

2510
01:55:05,991 --> 01:55:08,920
angles.
You get splattered by swabbing blood,

2511
01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:11,070
blood splatter on maybe before.
Yeah.

2512
01:55:11,120 --> 01:55:11,953
I've got into my mouth before one guy 
was talking to me and his nose was 

2513
01:55:14,450 --> 01:55:17,780
broken and every time he's talking at 
sprayed and around my lips.

2514
01:55:19,020 --> 01:55:22,460
And you're on live television.
Yeah.

2515
01:55:22,550 --> 01:55:23,240
Be like,
cut.

2516
01:55:23,240 --> 01:55:24,740
Give me a fucking.
Oh No.

2517
01:55:24,790 --> 01:55:27,410
You mean he was talking man.
Blood was coming out of his mouth.

2518
01:55:28,140 --> 01:55:29,180
Jesus.
Yeah,

2519
01:55:29,300 --> 01:55:30,950
I've gotten sprayed.
It's,

2520
01:55:31,210 --> 01:55:33,800
that's a easy part.
You know,

2521
01:55:33,980 --> 01:55:35,490
their job is,
was difficult.

2522
01:55:35,491 --> 01:55:36,324
Like that's someone's blood like that,
the guy getting hit and they're all 

2523
01:55:39,620 --> 01:55:41,670
tested HIV,
you know,

2524
01:55:41,720 --> 01:55:42,830
not everything,
everything,

2525
01:55:43,290 --> 01:55:44,123
everything.

2526
01:55:44,160 --> 01:55:45,120
And uh,
you know,

2527
01:55:45,121 --> 01:55:48,180
guys have been stopped from fighting 
because of certain things that have come

2528
01:55:48,181 --> 01:55:50,100
up in those tests.
Uh,

2529
01:55:50,130 --> 01:55:52,530
diseases and all kinds of shades.
Yeah.

2530
01:55:52,531 --> 01:55:53,350
Yeah,
sure.

2531
01:55:53,350 --> 01:55:54,660
Hepatitis,
for sure.

2532
01:55:54,661 --> 01:55:56,590
Some organizations have,
you know,

2533
01:55:56,790 --> 01:55:57,623
pulled guys off cards because they found
the way you should infectious blood to 

2534
01:56:00,750 --> 01:56:02,730
blood.
That's a bad thing to be.

2535
01:56:02,731 --> 01:56:03,564
Getting.
Staph infections are a real big deal 

2536
01:56:04,711 --> 01:56:06,720
too.
Sometimes people will get staff from the

2537
01:56:06,721 --> 01:56:09,520
fight or they're fighting and you find 
out the guy had like a sore staff.

2538
01:56:09,560 --> 01:56:12,120
One wasn't alerting anybody to it.
That happens.

2539
01:56:12,200 --> 01:56:15,300
A biotic resistant now.
Yep.

2540
01:56:15,360 --> 01:56:16,410
Yeah,
yeah,

2541
01:56:16,590 --> 01:56:17,423
yeah.
Staff of scary stuff and it's one of 

2542
01:56:19,051 --> 01:56:21,300
those things that sort of rarely gets 
discussed,

2543
01:56:21,720 --> 01:56:24,480
but I'm super important to keep healthy 
skin flora.

2544
01:56:24,690 --> 01:56:27,330
I tell people this is one of the most 
important aspects of it.

2545
01:56:27,331 --> 01:56:30,330
Don't use antibacterial soap.
Don't do it.

2546
01:56:30,330 --> 01:56:31,163
You're going to ruin your skin.
Flora your fucking agent orange in your 

2547
01:56:34,471 --> 01:56:36,330
whole skin,
like don't do it.

2548
01:56:36,450 --> 01:56:38,040
People think they're going to be 
healthier that way.

2549
01:56:38,090 --> 01:56:39,630
I'm just gonna use antibacterial that 
way.

2550
01:56:39,631 --> 01:56:40,464
I want to get into diseases.
You'll get like crazy warts on your 

2551
01:56:42,391 --> 01:56:45,030
hands and shit like you gotta be real 
careful with that stuff.

2552
01:56:45,060 --> 01:56:46,830
Yeah.
You don't want to kill that flora.

2553
01:56:47,370 --> 01:56:48,203
The Flora.
This is something I researched for this 

2554
01:56:49,951 --> 01:56:54,951
book that this section is a big problem 
because you don't get the vaginal bath,

2555
01:56:56,520 --> 01:56:57,353
have a skin flora and also intestinal.
Dave actually rubbed vaginal like 

2556
01:57:02,790 --> 01:57:03,623
whatever that jazz is on baby post birth
that have given us area and sections 

2557
01:57:07,531 --> 01:57:08,364
just to sort of that on them because if 
you don't it gets colonized by whatever 

2558
01:57:11,401 --> 01:57:12,234
is floating around in the air and you 
don't want what's floating in the air 

2559
01:57:14,041 --> 01:57:15,060
and the hospital.
Fuck.

2560
01:57:15,061 --> 01:57:15,870
Yeah,
no.

2561
01:57:15,870 --> 01:57:17,340
Yeah,
it is a crazy thing.

2562
01:57:17,341 --> 01:57:19,170
You know that there's a process and we 
don't.

2563
01:57:19,171 --> 01:57:20,004
We don't.
We think there was some details of that 

2564
01:57:21,091 --> 01:57:22,170
process.
We can.

2565
01:57:22,320 --> 01:57:25,200
We can skirt around that one.
We don't have to blow the pussy out.

2566
01:57:25,530 --> 01:57:25,821
No,
no,

2567
01:57:25,821 --> 01:57:27,030
no.
We're just going to go through the roof.

2568
01:57:27,060 --> 01:57:30,720
We're going to pop up a sunroof on that 
bitch and just it off on Monday.

2569
01:57:30,721 --> 01:57:33,600
So this stitch them up.
Everything's going to be fine.

2570
01:57:33,601 --> 01:57:34,434
She looks great in the vagina.
It retains its 100 percent of the last 

2571
01:57:37,520 --> 01:57:38,353
test.

2572
01:57:39,740 --> 01:57:42,720
We have to acknowledge where a couple of
guys here,

2573
01:57:42,721 --> 01:57:44,730
we're never going to have our taints 
slit.

2574
01:57:44,820 --> 01:57:45,630
Oh,
I get it.

2575
01:57:45,630 --> 01:57:48,150
I get it to get it 100 percent.
It's tough,

2576
01:57:48,450 --> 01:57:49,283
but I have a friend and his wife like 
specifically with saying a baby is not 

2577
01:57:53,371 --> 01:57:55,710
blowing my pussy out.
Not going to happen.

2578
01:57:56,170 --> 01:57:56,770
Yeah,
she,

2579
01:57:56,770 --> 01:57:58,380
she's going through the roof.
No matter what.

2580
01:58:01,650 --> 01:58:02,930
I fucking get it.
It's a circle.

2581
01:58:02,950 --> 01:58:07,620
It's such a primitive way to give birth.
You know the weirdest one is a Hyena.

2582
01:58:07,920 --> 01:58:09,930
The hyena that gives birth out of that 
fake Dick.

2583
01:58:10,200 --> 01:58:14,010
He a big glitzy,
massive clip.

2584
01:58:14,040 --> 01:58:15,270
What's a foe?
Penis.

2585
01:58:15,410 --> 01:58:18,440
I mean,
it literally looks like a giant Dick and

2586
01:58:18,450 --> 01:58:20,730
they're bigger.
That's what's fucked up about them.

2587
01:58:21,090 --> 01:58:21,923
They have a baby out of that thing too,
and they ride the mail and try to fuck 

2588
01:58:24,931 --> 01:58:27,960
them with that fake Dick.
Weird animal.

2589
01:58:27,990 --> 01:58:28,823
Maddening is that.
We're so lucky we don't have been here 

2590
01:58:31,500 --> 01:58:33,450
since I saw you.
What'd you do over there?

2591
01:58:33,470 --> 01:58:34,950
Yeah,
so I was in Mexico first,

2592
01:58:34,951 --> 01:58:36,960
then there was in Thailand for six 
weeks,

2593
01:58:37,560 --> 01:58:41,560
and then I was in southern Africa.
I did a 10 day safari.

2594
01:58:43,060 --> 01:58:44,740
Botswana.
Yeah.

2595
01:58:44,741 --> 01:58:49,280
Was that A.
I wouldn't do the same thing again.

2596
01:58:49,430 --> 01:58:50,031
Uh,
it was,

2597
01:58:50,031 --> 01:58:50,930
uh,
it was cool.

2598
01:58:50,931 --> 01:58:51,764
It was just wild dogs.
Safaris who do this sort of like a low 

2599
01:58:54,531 --> 01:58:55,364
budget,
get in the van and sleep in tents at 

2600
01:58:57,051 --> 01:59:01,250
night kind of thing.
And I picked this like massive thousand,

2601
01:59:01,251 --> 01:59:02,960
1500 mile,
whatever,

2602
01:59:02,961 --> 01:59:03,794
like see all of southern Africa,
which was dumb because you're just 

2603
01:59:07,311 --> 01:59:10,400
sitting in a van most of the time.
What kind of shots did you have to get?

2604
01:59:11,120 --> 01:59:12,800
I didn't get any shots for that.
Really?

2605
01:59:12,830 --> 01:59:13,400
Yeah.
No,

2606
01:59:13,400 --> 01:59:16,670
there's no yellow fever there.
There's some malaria,

2607
01:59:16,671 --> 01:59:20,780
but I've been in lots of places with 
malaria and I just avoid mosquitoes.

2608
01:59:20,810 --> 01:59:22,490
How do you do that?
You don't,

2609
01:59:22,730 --> 01:59:23,211
uh,
you have,

2610
01:59:23,211 --> 01:59:24,044
uh,
make sure you have a good net on your 

2611
01:59:25,041 --> 01:59:26,030
bed.
Uh,

2612
01:59:26,031 --> 01:59:28,700
you wear long sleeve light colored 
clothing,

2613
01:59:28,730 --> 01:59:29,563
light colored like white or something 
like that because there really are 

2614
01:59:31,941 --> 01:59:33,140
attracted to darker colors.

2615
01:59:33,190 --> 01:59:35,060
Well,
I think it's because you don't see them,

2616
01:59:35,450 --> 01:59:36,041
you know,
if you're,

2617
01:59:36,041 --> 01:59:36,874
if you have a white sleeve,
you'll see them landing and flying 

2618
01:59:38,751 --> 01:59:39,620
around.
Oh,

2619
01:59:39,621 --> 01:59:40,454
I see.
You're just constantly on the alert for 

2620
01:59:41,390 --> 01:59:43,130
little disease carrying monsters.
He,

2621
01:59:43,131 --> 01:59:44,480
uh,
and also,

2622
01:59:44,510 --> 01:59:45,680
you know,
allocational,

2623
01:59:45,690 --> 01:59:49,460
he used some of the DDT shit on my 
ankles and my neck and stuff.

2624
01:59:49,970 --> 01:59:50,803
Um,
but the other thing is you eat a lot of 

2625
01:59:52,221 --> 01:59:53,480
raw garlic.
Oh,

2626
01:59:53,481 --> 01:59:54,410
I heard,
I've heard that.

2627
01:59:54,411 --> 01:59:55,650
That's real.
Well,

2628
01:59:55,770 --> 01:59:56,603
I mean that's,
I've been doing it for years when I was 

2629
01:59:57,621 --> 02:00:01,070
on the road backpack and in places,
tropical places.

2630
02:00:01,071 --> 02:00:01,904
I was eating raw garlic every day,
which is really good for your 

2631
02:00:03,651 --> 02:00:06,740
intestines,
your intestinal flora and all that.

2632
02:00:07,040 --> 02:00:11,120
But your skin smells like garlic.
You start sweating it out right away.

2633
02:00:11,150 --> 02:00:12,380
Oh,
I smell like garlic all the time.

2634
02:00:12,381 --> 02:00:13,530
People Complain,
Oh,

2635
02:00:13,540 --> 02:00:15,470
I love the smell.
I like it too,

2636
02:00:15,500 --> 02:00:16,760
but it's not good on your breath.
Right?

2637
02:00:16,820 --> 02:00:17,810
Agreed.
Well,

2638
02:00:17,811 --> 02:00:20,930
what what you do is you chop it up,
put it,

2639
02:00:20,931 --> 02:00:23,210
throw it in your mouth and drink it down
with water.

2640
02:00:23,211 --> 02:00:25,040
You don't chew it.
I chew chewing.

2641
02:00:25,041 --> 02:00:27,350
It's what gives you the breadth because 
it gets in your teeth.

2642
02:00:27,650 --> 02:00:32,510
So if you take it like pills,
you'll get the garlic belch when you get

2643
02:00:32,511 --> 02:00:34,630
the garlic skin,
but you don't get the garlic breath.

2644
02:00:34,700 --> 02:00:35,570
I would feel like come

2645
02:00:35,580 --> 02:00:37,200
cheating because,
uh,

2646
02:00:37,260 --> 02:00:38,093
I'm kind of a glutton for those 
uncomfortable moments when you know 

2647
02:00:40,351 --> 02:00:41,184
you're doing something good like a 
chomping down the garlic and you feel 

2648
02:00:43,711 --> 02:00:45,600
those juices hit your tongue and you're 
like,

2649
02:00:45,601 --> 02:00:47,910
whoa.
You feel out,

2650
02:00:47,911 --> 02:00:52,911
your nose starts opening up.
I mix it with some fresh ginger.

2651
02:00:53,220 --> 02:00:54,270
I just throw it down,
man.

2652
02:00:54,271 --> 02:00:55,104
Yeah,
I mean anytime there's any feeling at 

2653
02:00:57,361 --> 02:01:01,860
all of stomach disease disease where if 
I feel bad,

2654
02:01:01,861 --> 02:01:02,694
I don't feel like I'm a little rundown.
I just choked down a bunch of cloves of 

2655
02:01:05,131 --> 02:01:08,220
garlic the other day I did it and it hit
me so hard.

2656
02:01:08,221 --> 02:01:09,960
I had to take a knee.
I was like,

2657
02:01:10,060 --> 02:01:13,140
aw.
Like as it was going down,

2658
02:01:13,141 --> 02:01:14,100
I was like,
Whoa,

2659
02:01:14,190 --> 02:01:15,140
man.
Could have stood up.

2660
02:01:15,150 --> 02:01:18,880
I wanted to sit down for dramatic 
purposes like wow,

2661
02:01:18,900 --> 02:01:22,710
take a knee or praising the Lord.
My goodness.

2662
02:01:22,710 --> 02:01:24,690
Garlic,
what are you doing to my insides?

2663
02:01:25,110 --> 02:01:28,860
I had a horrendous stomach virus right 
around new years.

2664
02:01:29,700 --> 02:01:34,080
I went through my New Year's Eve show,
convinced I was going to shit myself.

2665
02:01:34,590 --> 02:01:35,423
I was like,
there's gonna be a point in this show 

2666
02:01:36,901 --> 02:01:38,640
where I'm just going to have to shit 
myself.

2667
02:01:38,680 --> 02:01:40,910
And I thought about it all day before 
the show.

2668
02:01:40,911 --> 02:01:43,520
I didn't eat anything,
anything all day.

2669
02:01:44,040 --> 02:01:46,220
Like from the moment I woke up to the 
moment I went to bed.

2670
02:01:46,221 --> 02:01:50,450
I mean that was having broken fire 
hydrant experiences in the toilet.

2671
02:01:50,480 --> 02:01:51,281
Liquid.
Yeah.

2672
02:01:51,281 --> 02:01:55,040
We were just like,
where is all this coming from?

2673
02:01:55,550 --> 02:01:56,580
You know,
like I,

2674
02:01:56,700 --> 02:01:58,470
I couldn't believe it.
As I was saying,

2675
02:01:58,540 --> 02:02:01,190
wait a minute,
it was below anatomy.

2676
02:02:01,191 --> 02:02:05,000
Something inside of me was terrible.
Like whatever it was was terrible.

2677
02:02:05,240 --> 02:02:06,073
I had these farts that were they,
they smelled like fermented fruit in 

2678
02:02:11,271 --> 02:02:12,104
death,
like death mixed with this fermented 

2679
02:02:14,751 --> 02:02:16,020
sulfur,
like,

2680
02:02:16,310 --> 02:02:19,340
like the most rotten meat you could ever
cut.

2681
02:02:19,340 --> 02:02:22,640
Like if you opened up like a,
a fridgerator and the power had gone off

2682
02:02:22,641 --> 02:02:23,474
while you were on vacation and came back
and there was some hamburger meat that 

2683
02:02:25,791 --> 02:02:29,240
was rotten.
It smelled like that and like,

2684
02:02:30,020 --> 02:02:35,020
like sulfur and like a sweet,
like a vinegary,

2685
02:02:35,900 --> 02:02:39,650
almost like a fermented sort of a smell 
to.

2686
02:02:39,651 --> 02:02:42,770
It was getting belches were you getting 
sold?

2687
02:02:43,650 --> 02:02:46,700
It was all going on in some of my 
stomach because I wasn't eating much and

2688
02:02:46,701 --> 02:02:48,800
it was something that went around 
through my whole house.

2689
02:02:48,820 --> 02:02:50,840
My,
my littlest daughter got.

2690
02:02:51,130 --> 02:02:52,760
I mean I didn't know what she was going 
through,

2691
02:02:52,761 --> 02:02:56,300
but she was just constantly complaining 
about her stomach being really awful for

2692
02:02:56,301 --> 02:02:57,134
like a whole week we were skiing in 
Aspen and that's when it kicked in and 

2693
02:03:00,561 --> 02:03:03,080
when I got back I was like,
oh no,

2694
02:03:03,081 --> 02:03:05,590
like this is bad.
Have you.

2695
02:03:06,590 --> 02:03:08,590
Have you ever had an event on stage now?

2696
02:03:08,750 --> 02:03:11,660
Like a wet fart or something or like,
oh no I haven't,

2697
02:03:11,661 --> 02:03:14,240
but interestingly enough,
there's a new law that just got.

2698
02:03:14,270 --> 02:03:15,620
Well,
it might be proposed.

2699
02:03:15,621 --> 02:03:19,610
A new rule got proposed for the unified 
rules of mixed martial arts where if you

2700
02:03:19,611 --> 02:03:21,230
shit yourself,
they stopped the fight,

2701
02:03:22,580 --> 02:03:25,340
which has happened before because of 
shit themselves,

2702
02:03:25,410 --> 02:03:28,970
like during the middle of a fight,
just like loss of sphincter control.

2703
02:03:29,030 --> 02:03:29,863
Yeah man.
Sometimes you got to go like sometimes 

2704
02:03:31,551 --> 02:03:32,384
it's diarrhea,
sometimes kick you in the fucking gut 

2705
02:03:34,281 --> 02:03:35,740
and just blast it out.
The back,

2706
02:03:35,780 --> 02:03:36,613
there was a guy named Michael 
[inaudible] who was a very good fighter 

2707
02:03:38,841 --> 02:03:43,100
and he was fighting biennials Douche,
I believe.

2708
02:03:43,101 --> 02:03:44,390
Yes.
That's what the fight was.

2709
02:03:44,660 --> 02:03:45,493
And Benito diary.
It was a because I remember is a big 

2710
02:03:46,731 --> 02:03:49,250
victory for him because he choked 
biennials Dario out,

2711
02:03:49,580 --> 02:03:53,570
which was a giant because Dario,
she's like super respected Jujitsu,

2712
02:03:53,571 --> 02:03:56,590
black belt and Michael Chester as he got
into the octagon,

2713
02:03:56,600 --> 02:03:57,620
looked over and he goes,
dude,

2714
02:03:57,710 --> 02:04:00,800
I might shit my pants because I might 
shit my pants.

2715
02:04:00,830 --> 02:04:01,371
Right,
right.

2716
02:04:01,371 --> 02:04:02,270
While the fights going on,
I'm like,

2717
02:04:02,271 --> 02:04:03,470
seriously?
I was like,

2718
02:04:03,500 --> 02:04:04,450
took my headphones off.
Like,

2719
02:04:04,460 --> 02:04:05,540
seriously?
He's like,

2720
02:04:05,541 --> 02:04:06,710
yeah,
I'm going to shit my pants.

2721
02:04:07,070 --> 02:04:08,120
And so like,
okay.

2722
02:04:08,121 --> 02:04:10,490
I know I sound like I'm holding this in 
the back of my head.

2723
02:04:10,491 --> 02:04:11,324
I'm like,
I definitely shouldn't bring it up 

2724
02:04:12,231 --> 02:04:15,770
unless it becomes an issue because I 
don't want the public to dwell on that.

2725
02:04:15,980 --> 02:04:18,770
I want them to enjoy this great fight.
And then he got through without shitting

2726
02:04:18,771 --> 02:04:19,604
himself and then,
uh,

2727
02:04:19,610 --> 02:04:21,530
you know,
I asked him after like off Mike,

2728
02:04:21,531 --> 02:04:22,490
I'm like,
did you almost treat yourself?

2729
02:04:22,491 --> 02:04:23,324
It's like,
dude,

2730
02:04:23,690 --> 02:04:24,471
he goes,
I came out here.

2731
02:04:24,471 --> 02:04:25,940
I was convinced I was going to shit 
myself.

2732
02:04:26,330 --> 02:04:27,163
I used to get like before I would go on 
a TV show or do a big public speaking 

2733
02:04:31,521 --> 02:04:33,590
thing where they're going to be a lot of
people there.

2734
02:04:33,770 --> 02:04:34,603
I would like five,
10 minutes before I was supposed to go 

2735
02:04:37,441 --> 02:04:38,070
on stage.
I'd

2736
02:04:38,070 --> 02:04:39,480
be like,
I need to take a dump.

2737
02:04:39,570 --> 02:04:42,090
Like I need to do it right now.
I've taken a few dumps here.

2738
02:04:43,440 --> 02:04:45,510
Sorry about that.
I'm more relaxed now.

2739
02:04:45,570 --> 02:04:48,000
It's what it's for,
but I think there's a,

2740
02:04:48,001 --> 02:04:49,240
it's like a,
you know,

2741
02:04:49,260 --> 02:04:51,420
fight or flight thing.
I think animals get that too.

2742
02:04:51,430 --> 02:04:52,141
It's like,
oh,

2743
02:04:52,141 --> 02:04:54,180
this is,
I gotta get my shit together.

2744
02:04:54,181 --> 02:04:56,950
Literally get it out of me,
so I'm like,

2745
02:04:57,030 --> 02:04:58,370
yeah,
you know there was.

2746
02:04:58,410 --> 02:05:02,550
Well it's also your body does not want 
to waste any resources dealing with that

2747
02:05:02,690 --> 02:05:05,570
because it feels like there's like some 
catastrophe about to take price.

2748
02:05:05,970 --> 02:05:06,803
There's a video of these two bears,
these giant bears and it was in that 

2749
02:05:10,711 --> 02:05:12,930
movie grizzly man,
they're crazy dude,

2750
02:05:12,931 --> 02:05:13,764
that song movie,
but these two bears are fighting and 

2751
02:05:18,091 --> 02:05:21,390
while they're fighting they start 
shitting because their bodies just like,

2752
02:05:21,391 --> 02:05:22,410
look,
whatever this says,

2753
02:05:22,411 --> 02:05:23,520
get it out,
get it out.

2754
02:05:23,710 --> 02:05:25,530
We're going to war here.
We're not practicing.

2755
02:05:25,770 --> 02:05:26,280
Yeah,
no,

2756
02:05:26,280 --> 02:05:27,113
no thought whatsoever.
And no resources drawn away from the 

2757
02:05:30,181 --> 02:05:33,300
muscles to process the food because have
you ever done that?

2758
02:05:33,301 --> 02:05:35,310
Like eating a big meal and try to work 
out.

2759
02:05:36,600 --> 02:05:39,030
I never tried to work out,
but if you did,

2760
02:05:40,240 --> 02:05:42,570
you got nothing.
No energy,

2761
02:05:42,600 --> 02:05:44,970
no energy.
It's fascinating because it's like,

2762
02:05:45,270 --> 02:05:47,970
like it's almost like if you were a pie 
chart,

2763
02:05:48,340 --> 02:05:51,480
you could see there's a segment of that 
chart that is now missing.

2764
02:05:51,960 --> 02:05:54,150
You can kind of do it.
You can kind of work out,

2765
02:05:54,450 --> 02:05:57,600
but you definitely can't run a marathon 
or anything crazy.

2766
02:05:57,601 --> 02:05:58,141
You can't.
I mean,

2767
02:05:58,141 --> 02:05:58,974
if you do,
you'll be hurting all the fucking Wim 

2768
02:06:01,340 --> 02:06:01,720
Hoff.
Man,

2769
02:06:01,720 --> 02:06:02,553
you know,
you've been on your show a bunch of 

2770
02:06:03,481 --> 02:06:04,314
times.
I hung out with him for like a week and 

2771
02:06:05,281 --> 02:06:09,480
the Pyrenees and went up to his place in
Holland and like sort of became friends.

2772
02:06:09,830 --> 02:06:10,663
I mean,
that's an example of what I'm talking 

2773
02:06:11,311 --> 02:06:12,720
about.
I want to know these people,

2774
02:06:12,980 --> 02:06:15,120
you know,
like when I reached out to them,

2775
02:06:15,121 --> 02:06:15,601
they were like,
yeah,

2776
02:06:15,601 --> 02:06:17,250
we'll set up a thing.
You can do a skype.

2777
02:06:17,251 --> 02:06:18,021
And I was like,
fuck that.

2778
02:06:18,021 --> 02:06:20,130
I don't want to do a skype.
I want to meet this dude,

2779
02:06:20,131 --> 02:06:20,760
you know,
like,

2780
02:06:20,760 --> 02:06:21,750
tell me,
give me a day.

2781
02:06:21,751 --> 02:06:24,660
I'll fly to Holland.
I was in Spain at the time,

2782
02:06:24,661 --> 02:06:27,060
so it wasn't a big flight.
But anyway,

2783
02:06:27,450 --> 02:06:30,210
I was talking to him about it and it's 
like he's running all these marathons in

2784
02:06:30,211 --> 02:06:33,520
the fucking desert with no water and in 
the Arctic and you know.

2785
02:06:33,930 --> 02:06:36,690
Yeah.
But the dude doesn't work out.

2786
02:06:37,170 --> 02:06:38,400
No,
he runs marathons.

2787
02:06:38,401 --> 02:06:40,380
He doesn't work out.
He doesn't run because I hate running.

2788
02:06:40,460 --> 02:06:41,520
Yeah.
I'm like,

2789
02:06:41,521 --> 02:06:42,354
well,
how do you run a marathon if you don't 

2790
02:06:43,441 --> 02:06:44,100
train?

2791
02:06:44,100 --> 02:06:44,491
He's like,
oh,

2792
02:06:44,491 --> 02:06:47,280
it's just the mind.
Yeah.

2793
02:06:47,281 --> 02:06:50,790
I don't know what he's talking about.
I ran a five k and I was ready to die,

2794
02:06:51,510 --> 02:06:52,343
run up the fucking driveway.
I about her brother and I don't run and 

2795
02:06:55,620 --> 02:06:57,840
I ran a five k and I was like,
wow,

2796
02:06:57,841 --> 02:06:59,550
this is actually difficult.
I'm like,

2797
02:06:59,551 --> 02:07:00,590
I'm in great shape.
I'm like,

2798
02:07:00,591 --> 02:07:01,560
this,
I'm going to be able to do this.

2799
02:07:01,561 --> 02:07:02,880
I work out all the time.
I'm like,

2800
02:07:02,881 --> 02:07:03,714
I'm just going to go on this run is 
going to be just a thing I do because 

2801
02:07:07,120 --> 02:07:09,690
we're not used to using those muscles in
that way.

2802
02:07:09,691 --> 02:07:10,524
Or was it was was his cardiopulmonary 
waffle covered with peanut butter and 

2803
02:07:15,571 --> 02:07:18,030
then covered with maple syrup.
I gave myself an excuse.

2804
02:07:18,230 --> 02:07:19,063
I'm like,
I'm going to run this crazy race car 

2805
02:07:20,790 --> 02:07:21,623
book,
but my body's just not used to eating 

2806
02:07:23,611 --> 02:07:24,444
that nonsense,
so I think it had shut down production 

2807
02:07:27,181 --> 02:07:28,014
of a lot of key ingredients.
There was definitely that feeling like 

2808
02:07:31,730 --> 02:07:32,563
when I was running,
I could feel like offices from them 

2809
02:07:35,550 --> 02:07:36,190
waffle coming

2810
02:07:36,190 --> 02:07:37,650
up my throat.
I can taste it,

2811
02:07:37,670 --> 02:07:40,180
kick it in the peanut butter and syrup 
together.

2812
02:07:40,630 --> 02:07:43,780
So much sugar.
But it's all just,

2813
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:45,220
you know,
your feet,

2814
02:07:45,340 --> 02:07:47,830
your feet aren't used to running on.
It was on concrete.

2815
02:07:48,460 --> 02:07:51,460
The whole thing is weird in the shocks 
on your knees and your ankles.

2816
02:07:51,670 --> 02:07:52,840
You ever read,
born to run?

2817
02:07:53,400 --> 02:07:54,370
No.
No,

2818
02:07:54,400 --> 02:07:57,770
but I do know the premise of it.
Chris and Doug Dogo.

2819
02:07:57,880 --> 02:08:01,540
It's about the way shoes running shoes 
are developed and yeah,

2820
02:08:01,541 --> 02:08:02,374
and how our bodies are designed to run 
on the balls of her feet and he goes 

2821
02:08:05,231 --> 02:08:10,110
down in the lives with the Tarahumara 
Indians in Mexico and the bank,

2822
02:08:10,120 --> 02:08:10,953
they'll Kobe where I was in 1988,
so I was back there with those Indians 

2823
02:08:15,040 --> 02:08:15,873
and they run into like really thin shoes
or barefoot barefoot or they make these 

2824
02:08:19,091 --> 02:08:21,530
sandals out of the tire,
you know,

2825
02:08:21,660 --> 02:08:23,860
and it's just strapped on their foot.
It's just a thing.

2826
02:08:24,550 --> 02:08:26,110
And they run forever.
Yeah.

2827
02:08:26,111 --> 02:08:26,944
Well,
that's how the body's meant and I mean 

2828
02:08:28,541 --> 02:08:29,374
we're,
we're meant to use the foot as this 

2829
02:08:30,071 --> 02:08:31,360
amazing shock absorber,
you know,

2830
02:08:31,361 --> 02:08:33,610
you land on the ball,
the frame it was him.

2831
02:08:33,810 --> 02:08:35,760
That's what the calf muscles for.
Yeah.

2832
02:08:35,770 --> 02:08:38,180
And also the arch and there are all 
these bones.

2833
02:08:38,720 --> 02:08:39,860
Yeah.
Yeah.

2834
02:08:39,980 --> 02:08:42,430
Crazy short.
It's like the birth thing,

2835
02:08:42,431 --> 02:08:43,040
you know,

2836
02:08:43,040 --> 02:08:45,750
thing yesterday.
The sock is same thing.

2837
02:08:45,751 --> 02:08:48,660
I mean it's supposed to be replacing 
that barefoot feeling,

2838
02:08:48,661 --> 02:08:50,210
I suppose.
It's a really expensive sock.

2839
02:08:50,211 --> 02:08:52,080
It's like 80 bucks.
Just a sock,

2840
02:08:52,140 --> 02:08:53,370
but kind of a.
it's made,

2841
02:08:53,371 --> 02:08:55,050
it shows at the end of the video shows 
what it's made of.

2842
02:08:55,051 --> 02:08:55,884
It's got some sort of spray polymer 
that's like 15 times stronger than 

2843
02:08:58,801 --> 02:08:59,790
steel.
Whoa.

2844
02:08:59,820 --> 02:09:04,190
So you can like do rock climbing,
tightrope walking or running outside and

2845
02:09:04,191 --> 02:09:06,600
it's just as a guess.
It feels like silk.

2846
02:09:06,601 --> 02:09:07,890
It's it,
it feels just like a sock.

2847
02:09:08,040 --> 02:09:09,920
Holy Shit.
I'm pretty interested in it.

2848
02:09:09,921 --> 02:09:12,750
I don't know how legit it is,
but just get it pretty new.

2849
02:09:12,840 --> 02:09:13,673
I work out barefoot most of the time.
I work out barefoot when I do 

2850
02:09:16,831 --> 02:09:17,970
kickboxing,
workout,

2851
02:09:17,971 --> 02:09:19,150
barefoot.
If I do Jujitsu,

2852
02:09:19,230 --> 02:09:20,760
workout barefoot,
if I lift weights,

2853
02:09:21,360 --> 02:09:22,193
I do almost everything barefoot.
Occasionally I'll do like an elliptical 

2854
02:09:24,001 --> 02:09:26,220
machine or something like that with 
shoes on,

2855
02:09:26,730 --> 02:09:29,910
but I feel like when you are barefoot,
like I do yoga barefoot,

2856
02:09:29,911 --> 02:09:32,120
obviously.
I feel like when you're barefoot you get

2857
02:09:32,121 --> 02:09:34,730
to feel your toes are like digging into 
the ground.

2858
02:09:34,750 --> 02:09:35,583
The rolling.

2859
02:09:36,320 --> 02:09:39,100
I just,
I feel like it makes a big difference in

2860
02:09:39,101 --> 02:09:42,280
a lot of the nervous system terminates 
in the sole of the feet.

2861
02:09:42,340 --> 02:09:46,500
So there's,
in Chinese medicine there's a lot of um,

2862
02:09:47,500 --> 02:09:50,680
attention paid.
Reflexology is about how,

2863
02:09:50,880 --> 02:09:52,960
you know,
I don't know how real it is,

2864
02:09:52,961 --> 02:09:53,794
but it is real that the,
a lot of the nervous system terminates 

2865
02:09:56,771 --> 02:09:59,290
at the soles of the feet.
That's why foot massage feels so good.

2866
02:09:59,740 --> 02:10:00,573
And so the theory is with this barefoot 
shit is that by having that experience 

2867
02:10:04,961 --> 02:10:05,794
you're describing where your toes are 
digging in and you're feeling your 

2868
02:10:07,511 --> 02:10:10,390
weight being shifting in different parts
of your foot.

2869
02:10:10,391 --> 02:10:15,340
Having that part of your body alive,
inactive is really good for your overall

2870
02:10:16,180 --> 02:10:18,910
psychological health and nervous health.
Does that makes sense?

2871
02:10:18,920 --> 02:10:19,960
Does make sense?
Yeah.

2872
02:10:20,200 --> 02:10:22,370
It just feels good to do and there's 
like,

2873
02:10:22,860 --> 02:10:26,100
you feel good for a reason,
right?

2874
02:10:26,110 --> 02:10:30,520
You know the word evolve too.
To have them feel good because it's good

2875
02:10:30,521 --> 02:10:31,354
for us.
Brings us back to beaten off or fucking 

2876
02:10:33,621 --> 02:10:34,040
one of those

2877
02:10:34,040 --> 02:10:36,020
dog things.
I drinking off a dog with A.

2878
02:10:36,230 --> 02:10:40,040
I wonder if we should call that company 
and ask questions and they say like,

2879
02:10:40,041 --> 02:10:41,040
what kind of dog do you have?
Oh,

2880
02:10:41,041 --> 02:10:44,680
I don't have a dog.
Yeah,

2881
02:10:44,690 --> 02:10:47,930
this nefarious intentions.
I just like watch dogs.

2882
02:10:47,931 --> 02:10:48,764
Fuck robots.
It's just for dogs that wonder by my 

2883
02:10:54,830 --> 02:10:58,250
friend Joe when I was growing up,
Joe Spagnolo and he had a.

2884
02:10:59,090 --> 02:10:59,923
He had a dog that was just like really 
ornery little dog and his dog had a 

2885
02:11:03,471 --> 02:11:04,304
stuffed animal that it would fuck and it
would just bite this stuffed animal and 

2886
02:11:10,461 --> 02:11:12,620
fuck the shit out of it.
And you'd come over his house.

2887
02:11:13,040 --> 02:11:13,873
Joe's bags.
You'd go over his house and his dog 

2888
02:11:15,171 --> 02:11:18,380
would be fucking the shit out of this 
stuffed animal.

2889
02:11:18,381 --> 02:11:19,050
And you're like,
whoa.

2890
02:11:19,050 --> 02:11:20,750
How'd you'd clean it?
I don't know.

2891
02:11:20,751 --> 02:11:21,920
I mean,
you couldn't even go near that thing.

2892
02:11:21,921 --> 02:11:22,754
That dog was like,
he would get ferocious if you tried to 

2893
02:11:26,841 --> 02:11:30,260
get near his stuffed animal.
There's a little tiny ass dog too.

2894
02:11:30,261 --> 02:11:31,094
I don't remember what he was.
That's like your friend with the 

2895
02:11:32,301 --> 02:11:33,500
restraining order,
man.

2896
02:11:33,590 --> 02:11:35,120
Love is love,
you know,

2897
02:11:35,350 --> 02:11:38,600
there's no way around it to do.
But that dog was obsessed.

2898
02:11:38,750 --> 02:11:39,583
That was his world.
His world is like biting the stuffed 

2899
02:11:41,361 --> 02:11:43,090
animal and just plug into have.

2900
02:11:46,520 --> 02:11:48,920
Hey,
somebody asked me to raise an issue with

2901
02:11:48,921 --> 02:11:50,160
you.
Uh,

2902
02:11:50,540 --> 02:11:51,373
apparently you've,
you're under the impression that 

2903
02:11:53,181 --> 02:11:56,090
everyone died at 30 and prehistory.
Is that true?

2904
02:11:56,360 --> 02:11:56,870
Uh,
I,

2905
02:11:56,870 --> 02:11:59,840
I joke around about that all the time 
that lifespans were incredibly low.

2906
02:11:59,841 --> 02:12:02,030
A long time ago.
Lived to be like 30,

2907
02:12:02,031 --> 02:12:03,950
you know,
it's a hyperbole for the most part.

2908
02:12:03,951 --> 02:12:04,550
Okay,
good.

2909
02:12:04,550 --> 02:12:06,830
I know people did leave love live 
longer,

2910
02:12:07,190 --> 02:12:08,023
but the age that people died,
the average age was much lower than it 

2911
02:12:10,461 --> 02:12:12,710
is today just because lots of babies 
died.

2912
02:12:12,830 --> 02:12:13,910
So it's,
yeah,

2913
02:12:13,930 --> 02:12:14,763
it's a mathematical average.
But species by design by has evolved to 

2914
02:12:19,821 --> 02:12:20,654
live into our sixties and seventies and 
hunter gatherers who get through the 

2915
02:12:23,661 --> 02:12:26,060
first few years where there's a lot of 
risk.

2916
02:12:26,630 --> 02:12:29,990
So it's a huge thing also.
It's all rounded out math thing.

2917
02:12:29,991 --> 02:12:30,560
Yeah.
Oh,

2918
02:12:30,560 --> 02:12:31,393
that's interesting.
So I was under the impression that 

2919
02:12:32,870 --> 02:12:36,920
people just got diet of violence and a 
lot of diseases by the time they were in

2920
02:12:36,921 --> 02:12:37,580
their thirties.

2921
02:12:37,580 --> 02:12:41,120
No.
Most of the diseases that we suffer from

2922
02:12:41,121 --> 02:12:46,080
are the result of agriculture.
So you look at all the major killers of,

2923
02:12:46,110 --> 02:12:50,840
of humans.
Swine flew from pigs or chicken pox from

2924
02:12:50,870 --> 02:12:55,050
chickens.
Obviously Avian Flus come domesticated.

2925
02:12:55,170 --> 02:12:57,020
And Jamie would,
he posted up there?

2926
02:12:57,170 --> 02:12:59,990
Human lifespan.
Nearly constant for 2000 years.

2927
02:13:00,060 --> 02:13:02,550
Oh.
So like ultimate lights fan.

2928
02:13:02,960 --> 02:13:05,360
But when I was talking about most of 
these diseases and violence,

2929
02:13:06,170 --> 02:13:06,921
yeah.
The,

2930
02:13:06,921 --> 02:13:10,100
the violence thing is overrepresented if
you,

2931
02:13:10,130 --> 02:13:13,070
unless you live in Mongolia.
If you read the.

2932
02:13:13,100 --> 02:13:13,881
Yes,
what is it?

2933
02:13:13,881 --> 02:13:16,830
Seventy five.
And I don't know if that looks free.

2934
02:13:16,880 --> 02:13:17,640
History is this?
No.

2935
02:13:17,640 --> 02:13:18,230
Good.
Okay.

2936
02:13:18,230 --> 02:13:20,150
Uh,
life expectancy for men in 19.

2937
02:13:20,151 --> 02:13:21,800
Oh,
seven was 45 years.

2938
02:13:22,630 --> 02:13:25,310
Forty five years by 1957,
it rose to 66,

2939
02:13:25,610 --> 02:13:26,443
2007 to reach 75.
Unlike the most recent increase in life 

2940
02:13:30,690 --> 02:13:32,160
expectancy,
which is attributed

2941
02:13:32,160 --> 02:13:35,490
largely to a decline in half of the 
leading causes of death,

2942
02:13:35,491 --> 02:13:37,800
including heart disease,
homicide and influenza.

2943
02:13:38,070 --> 02:13:40,290
The increase in life expectancy between 
19 Oh,

2944
02:13:40,291 --> 02:13:43,080
seven and 2007 with largely due to the 
decreasing,

2945
02:13:43,320 --> 02:13:46,740
decreasing infant mortality rate,
which is like nine point nine,

2946
02:13:46,741 --> 02:13:48,090
nine percent.
That's interesting.

2947
02:13:48,240 --> 02:13:52,980
So what that is like is like the wage 
gap,

2948
02:13:53,850 --> 02:13:55,760
the gender wage gap issue,
right?

2949
02:13:56,040 --> 02:13:56,873
Where a lot of people say they love to 
quote that thing that say that men make 

2950
02:14:01,230 --> 02:14:04,680
so much more money than women that women
make eighty cents to the dollar,

2951
02:14:05,040 --> 02:14:06,280
but they're doing different jobs.
Right?

2952
02:14:06,510 --> 02:14:07,710
So like you think about it,
you go,

2953
02:14:07,711 --> 02:14:09,210
wow,
there's an injustice going on.

2954
02:14:09,211 --> 02:14:12,150
And then you realize like,
well maybe there is some sexism,

2955
02:14:12,151 --> 02:14:14,430
but this is not what they're talking 
about when they're saying this.

2956
02:14:14,460 --> 02:14:17,970
They're talking about different jobs.
The men are at higher risk,

2957
02:14:17,971 --> 02:14:18,804
they die more often on the job.
Men like when they almost exclusively 

2958
02:14:21,901 --> 02:14:25,650
populated the community of minors and 
lumber jacks and shit like that,

2959
02:14:25,651 --> 02:14:26,484
where people get hit by trees and women 
take time off when they have kids and 

2960
02:14:30,390 --> 02:14:33,030
they also work less hours.
They're less crazy.

2961
02:14:33,420 --> 02:14:35,340
Some men will fucking work themselves to
death.

2962
02:14:35,341 --> 02:14:36,830
Were very few women will.
Yeah.

2963
02:14:36,940 --> 02:14:37,773
Take it to that list.
Certainly are plenty of examples of men 

2964
02:14:40,361 --> 02:14:43,780
and women doing exactly the same job and
women are getting paid less.

2965
02:14:43,870 --> 02:14:44,703
I'm sure it must have been,
but it's not statistically 

2966
02:14:46,301 --> 02:14:48,050
significantly.
It's not what you're talking.

2967
02:14:48,760 --> 02:14:51,880
They attribute that from the.
When women get less,

2968
02:14:51,910 --> 02:14:55,060
they think that one thing to be 
considered when you look at that is that

2969
02:14:55,330 --> 02:14:56,163
women might not be as aggressive when 
they're negotiating a starting salary 

2970
02:14:59,620 --> 02:15:00,453
and that men may be more confident and 
cock shore of their worth more cocky 

2971
02:15:04,361 --> 02:15:05,194
with how they,
uh,

2972
02:15:05,320 --> 02:15:06,230
who knows though.
I don't,

2973
02:15:06,940 --> 02:15:07,773
but it's one of those things.
So I was under the impression that 

2974
02:15:09,401 --> 02:15:10,510
people did die.

2975
02:15:10,650 --> 02:15:11,011
Yeah.
Well,

2976
02:15:11,011 --> 02:15:12,810
most people are under that impression.
I've,

2977
02:15:12,830 --> 02:15:14,180
I've had,
I've spoken,

2978
02:15:14,550 --> 02:15:15,383
given talks at medical schools and stuff
and all these doctors think that 

2979
02:15:17,910 --> 02:15:21,920
everyone died at 35 to 35 year old 
results and they're like,

2980
02:15:21,930 --> 02:15:24,630
and it works its way into medicine where
they're like,

2981
02:15:24,631 --> 02:15:25,141
okay,
look,

2982
02:15:25,141 --> 02:15:25,974
the reason you have chronic back pain is
that the human body was not evolved to 

2983
02:15:29,041 --> 02:15:29,874
live beyond 35,
and so of course you have wear and tear 

2984
02:15:32,731 --> 02:15:33,564
and things like that's totally false.
The human bodies evolved to live into 

2985
02:15:36,361 --> 02:15:39,840
the seventies,
so it's a statistical thing.

2986
02:15:39,841 --> 02:15:42,000
It's like if Bill Gates moves into your 
neighborhood,

2987
02:15:42,001 --> 02:15:44,810
suddenly everyone's average annual 
salary is million,

2988
02:15:44,910 --> 02:15:46,500
hundreds of millions of dollars,
right?

2989
02:15:46,800 --> 02:15:50,340
So if you count all these infants who 
died in prehistory,

2990
02:15:50,640 --> 02:15:53,160
many of whom by the way died from 
infanticide.

2991
02:15:53,220 --> 02:15:56,640
Like twins normally are not allowed to 
survive.

2992
02:15:56,670 --> 02:15:57,503
The,
the weaker one is left in the woods to 

2993
02:15:59,611 --> 02:16:00,440
die.

2994
02:16:00,440 --> 02:16:03,920
Yeah.
Any sort of deform and mal formality,

2995
02:16:03,921 --> 02:16:05,430
we just leave them in the woods by 
themselves.

2996
02:16:05,880 --> 02:16:07,880
What a cruel way to handle it.
Yeah.

2997
02:16:08,500 --> 02:16:09,930
Oh,
that's dark man.

2998
02:16:09,931 --> 02:16:12,600
They would leave him to wolves.
That's fucked up,

2999
02:16:12,601 --> 02:16:14,550
man.
Leave your baby in a basket.

3000
02:16:14,551 --> 02:16:17,000
And run away.
Ooh,

3001
02:16:17,220 --> 02:16:18,100
yeah.
There's a lot of,

3002
02:16:18,300 --> 02:16:20,580
a lot of infanticide,
but you know,

3003
02:16:20,581 --> 02:16:21,630
in our world,
a lot of it,

3004
02:16:21,631 --> 02:16:22,530
huh?
Yeah.

3005
02:16:22,630 --> 02:16:23,463
Well,
just because of the times were harder 

3006
02:16:24,031 --> 02:16:24,864
than.
And it was more accepted that you were 

3007
02:16:25,651 --> 02:16:28,050
going to have to do some terrible things
that you didn't want to do.

3008
02:16:28,110 --> 02:16:29,010
Well,
it's just,

3009
02:16:29,260 --> 02:16:30,100
you know,
if a kid's

3010
02:16:30,100 --> 02:16:35,100
born physically fucked up in some way,
you know,

3011
02:16:35,980 --> 02:16:36,813
you're not gonna,
you're not gonna have the resources and 

3012
02:16:38,621 --> 02:16:39,454
that kid's not going to,
that person's not going to grow up to 

3013
02:16:41,710 --> 02:16:44,800
contribute to the group.
And so generally,

3014
02:16:45,340 --> 02:16:49,000
and also there's a different sense of 
life and death,

3015
02:16:49,420 --> 02:16:52,150
you know,
I think we're death is much more a daily

3016
02:16:52,151 --> 02:16:54,340
presence.
It's not that big a deal.

3017
02:16:54,730 --> 02:16:55,563
So we're all going to die there.
I was reading about a tribe in the 

3018
02:16:57,911 --> 02:16:59,450
Amazon.
Uh,

3019
02:16:59,560 --> 02:17:04,510
I can't remember the name of the tribe,
but when someone gets too old to keep up

3020
02:17:04,511 --> 02:17:08,170
with the group,
someone has chosen randomly,

3021
02:17:08,171 --> 02:17:11,650
like they have a lottery or pick the 
shortest straw or whatever it is.

3022
02:17:12,460 --> 02:17:13,293
And their job is to come up behind this 
old person and hit him in the back of 

3023
02:17:17,111 --> 02:17:18,220
the head with a hatchet.

3024
02:17:18,420 --> 02:17:20,250
Oh boy.

3025
02:17:20,550 --> 02:17:22,620
Right.
And no one wants to do it.

3026
02:17:22,621 --> 02:17:25,800
It really sucks,
but everyone agrees it has to be done.

3027
02:17:25,860 --> 02:17:30,860
And it's the least cruel option that 
they've come up

3028
02:17:31,270 --> 02:17:33,470
real careful to do to keep signing up 
for that job.

3029
02:17:34,440 --> 02:17:35,650
Exactly.
Got It.

3030
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,160
Last time.
So Papa Joe,

3031
02:17:40,161 --> 02:17:44,090
you've killed nine old ladies this way.
This bitches gone over.

3032
02:17:44,650 --> 02:17:45,650
Okay.
We'll just let her stop.

3033
02:17:46,550 --> 02:17:48,510
Ooh,
that's weird.

3034
02:17:48,650 --> 02:17:50,790
That's a weird gig.
So anyway.

3035
02:17:50,820 --> 02:17:54,030
No human being has ever been old at the 
age of four.

3036
02:17:54,040 --> 02:17:54,873
Look at this

3037
02:17:54,980 --> 02:17:55,813
heartbreaking pictures of parents 
leaving their children in China's 

3038
02:17:58,371 --> 02:18:00,550
notorious baby hatches.
So yeah.

3039
02:18:00,830 --> 02:18:01,850
What is that?
Well,

3040
02:18:01,851 --> 02:18:03,770
that's,
that's probably girls.

3041
02:18:03,830 --> 02:18:04,663
The moment of despair.
As parents cling to their children for 

3042
02:18:07,161 --> 02:18:11,870
one last time before abandoning them in 
China's so called baby hatches,

3043
02:18:12,080 --> 02:18:15,380
the father kisses his child,
her face hidden in a blanket.

3044
02:18:15,381 --> 02:18:16,214
The mother holds her hooded baby has 
their shadows are cast upon the last 

3045
02:18:19,371 --> 02:18:23,000
door they will pass through together.
Another collapses to the ground,

3046
02:18:23,001 --> 02:18:24,860
reaching out to touch her son for the 
last time.

3047
02:18:24,861 --> 02:18:28,010
What in the fuck?
Oh my God,

3048
02:18:28,011 --> 02:18:29,810
the baby is.
She says in quotes,

3049
02:18:29,811 --> 02:18:31,940
my baby cannot take care of itself when 
it grows up.

3050
02:18:31,941 --> 02:18:34,970
One woman cries explaining that her 
infant has down syndrome.

3051
02:18:35,600 --> 02:18:36,433
I just want my baby to survive.
She tells the information times news 

3052
02:18:39,021 --> 02:18:40,880
based in.
I don't know how to say that.

3053
02:18:40,970 --> 02:18:45,940
Guang huge owl.
She had an accompanying female friendly.

3054
02:18:45,970 --> 02:18:47,840
Both in tears.
Fuck man.

3055
02:18:48,740 --> 02:18:50,540
Well,
this has been happening forever.

3056
02:18:50,541 --> 02:18:52,550
I mean,
we have safe baby drop

3057
02:18:52,570 --> 02:18:53,403
Bob's here.
Every hospital has a sign that it's a 

3058
02:18:55,361 --> 02:18:56,920
safe baby.
Drop off.

3059
02:18:58,030 --> 02:18:59,930
Take that off the screen or

3060
02:19:00,120 --> 02:19:00,953
and in medieval Europe it was so common 
that they had these little boxes that 

3061
02:19:07,500 --> 02:19:11,880
rotated and so you could leave your baby
and just spin the box.

3062
02:19:11,881 --> 02:19:13,590
They didn't have to look at it.
No one would ever see,

3063
02:19:13,591 --> 02:19:15,660
you know.
See who was dropping it off.

3064
02:19:15,690 --> 02:19:17,630
It was anonymous.
Oh my God.

3065
02:19:17,670 --> 02:19:18,503
Very common.
They called a foundling hospitals and 

3066
02:19:21,040 --> 02:19:23,400
over 90 percent of the babies left there
died bad

3067
02:19:25,080 --> 02:19:27,490
boy in Germany.
They had with.

3068
02:19:27,580 --> 02:19:29,780
What are they called?
Angel makers?

3069
02:19:30,670 --> 02:19:32,740
This,
and this is through the beginning of the

3070
02:19:32,741 --> 02:19:33,574
20th century up to World War II.
It was a nanny that you hired with the 

3071
02:19:37,511 --> 02:19:39,730
understanding that your baby was going 
to die,

3072
02:19:40,880 --> 02:19:43,040
so it was like a babysitter who's going 
to kill your baby?

3073
02:19:43,100 --> 02:19:44,630
Oh my God.
Yeah,

3074
02:19:44,870 --> 02:19:45,703
so you would hire this nanny because 
your kid had down syndrome or some sort 

3075
02:19:48,021 --> 02:19:51,500
of a disease or something like that,
or it was born out of wedlock,

3076
02:19:51,680 --> 02:19:53,120
you know,
whatever.

3077
02:19:53,121 --> 02:19:55,460
The nanny would kill the baby.
Oh my God.

3078
02:19:55,490 --> 02:19:56,323
They called them angel makers.
The idea that infanticide was 

3079
02:19:59,320 --> 02:20:00,153
historically significant.
It's significant in the death of the 

3080
02:20:02,841 --> 02:20:05,120
population that that was so common.

3081
02:20:06,410 --> 02:20:07,243
Well,
I mean today we have abortion and I 

3082
02:20:08,721 --> 02:20:09,890
don't want to get into,
you know,

3083
02:20:10,100 --> 02:20:13,490
heavy shit,
but like now if a baby's inconvenient or

3084
02:20:13,491 --> 02:20:15,830
there's a disease that's detected or 
whatever,

3085
02:20:15,890 --> 02:20:17,180
you know,
cut it off at the past,

3086
02:20:17,200 --> 02:20:19,430
you cut it off at the pass.
In those days there wasn't.

3087
02:20:19,431 --> 02:20:21,800
So it was sort of postnatal abortion 
essentially.

3088
02:20:22,400 --> 02:20:24,600
I feel like abortion is one of those 
subjects were

3089
02:20:24,900 --> 02:20:28,920
ideally upon breaching the subject.
There's a tension in the room.

3090
02:20:28,950 --> 02:20:31,110
I've just felt it.
I apologize for it.

3091
02:20:31,111 --> 02:20:32,520
You know,
you're right.

3092
02:20:32,521 --> 02:20:35,910
There's no way.
Because the thing is both sides are.

3093
02:20:35,911 --> 02:20:36,630
Right,
right.

3094
02:20:36,630 --> 02:20:38,040
That's the problem.
You're 100 percent,

3095
02:20:38,041 --> 02:20:38,874
right?
Yeah.

3096
02:20:39,090 --> 02:20:41,310
That's 100 percent the problem.
Yeah.

3097
02:20:41,720 --> 02:20:43,680
And there are a lot of issues like that.
Yeah.

3098
02:20:43,681 --> 02:20:44,514
It's one of those things where people 
screaming at you and get crazy and 

3099
02:20:47,641 --> 02:20:50,900
they'll pick a side and it's death and 
it's this and it's that and it's,

3100
02:20:51,040 --> 02:20:52,800
it's a woman's choice to choose.
And it's,

3101
02:20:52,880 --> 02:20:54,840
you're both right.
You're both right.

3102
02:20:55,080 --> 02:20:58,830
Like I got in an argument once with the 
comedian about it and he,

3103
02:20:58,960 --> 02:21:02,760
it was about Richard Dawkins was talking
about a,

3104
02:21:02,761 --> 02:21:05,700
um,
it was on twitter that an embryo,

3105
02:21:05,701 --> 02:21:06,534
human embryo is like,
it's almost no different than a pig 

3106
02:21:09,451 --> 02:21:10,284
embryo.
Like he was making this about at six 

3107
02:21:13,231 --> 02:21:14,160
weeks of life or whatever.

3108
02:21:14,160 --> 02:21:15,300
It would be a very,
very,

3109
02:21:15,301 --> 02:21:17,460
very early age.
I guess not even,

3110
02:21:17,461 --> 02:21:18,660
that wouldn't even be an embryo.
Right.

3111
02:21:18,690 --> 02:21:20,270
What would it be?
Still an embryo,

3112
02:21:20,470 --> 02:21:21,960
an embryo.
Then right,

3113
02:21:21,961 --> 02:21:22,794
okay,
so an embryo is the earliest stages and 

3114
02:21:24,181 --> 02:21:26,880
he was comparing it to a pig and I was 
like,

3115
02:21:26,970 --> 02:21:27,803
well,
you know how crazy that is a ridiculous 

3116
02:21:28,711 --> 02:21:30,540
thing to say because it's not going to 
be a pig,

3117
02:21:30,960 --> 02:21:31,793
but if you leave it alone it's going to 
be a person so you know it's going to 

3118
02:21:33,721 --> 02:21:34,560
grow up to be a person.
Like.

3119
02:21:34,561 --> 02:21:36,870
It's like saying that it's no different 
than a pig.

3120
02:21:36,871 --> 02:21:39,750
It's totally disingenuous.
So I mean this comedian,

3121
02:21:39,751 --> 02:21:40,800
we were arguing and he started calling 
me,

3122
02:21:40,801 --> 02:21:43,010
you a right winger.
He's like saying that I was,

3123
02:21:43,270 --> 02:21:44,190
that I was writing.
I'm like,

3124
02:21:44,191 --> 02:21:45,024
I am not right wing,
but you are definitely killing a person 

3125
02:21:47,730 --> 02:21:49,260
that's about to be born.

3126
02:21:49,560 --> 02:21:50,400
I mean,
that's what you're doing.

3127
02:21:50,401 --> 02:21:53,070
You're cutting it off.
What you cut off at three cells or three

3128
02:21:53,071 --> 02:21:54,330
months.
It's the same thing.

3129
02:21:54,750 --> 02:21:55,790
It really is.
I mean,

3130
02:21:55,850 --> 02:21:56,730
be.
It's not.

3131
02:21:56,760 --> 02:21:57,890
It's not.
It becomes.

3132
02:21:57,950 --> 02:22:00,450
It becomes much more like a baby.
It looks more like a baby.

3133
02:22:00,451 --> 02:22:03,660
It's more,
it's more intensive and a procedure,

3134
02:22:03,960 --> 02:22:04,793
but once the process is started,
you've decided at various stage of the 

3135
02:22:08,371 --> 02:22:10,680
way that it becomes okay.
You know,

3136
02:22:10,681 --> 02:22:13,440
like late term abortions are frowned 
upon by almost everybody.

3137
02:22:13,441 --> 02:22:14,274
Right?
When you get into the fucking the last 

3138
02:22:16,470 --> 02:22:17,730
couple of weeks of a baby's life,
you can't really.

3139
02:22:17,800 --> 02:22:19,830
Or before it gets birth,
nobody.

3140
02:22:19,860 --> 02:22:20,693
Very few people are going to agree that 
you could just suck out the baby with a 

3141
02:22:22,591 --> 02:22:25,230
vacuum when it's nine months old.
You know?

3142
02:22:25,231 --> 02:22:26,910
That's,
that's a little intense,

3143
02:22:26,930 --> 02:22:27,763
right?
Almost everybody agrees that's a little 

3144
02:22:28,621 --> 02:22:32,040
intense.
So that means that we all have some sort

3145
02:22:32,041 --> 02:22:34,530
of a reasonable cutoff.
Anybody who believes in abortion,

3146
02:22:34,770 --> 02:22:38,190
we have some sort of a reasonable cutoff
will were accepted when it's a bundle of

3147
02:22:38,191 --> 02:22:39,150
cells,
when it's.

3148
02:22:39,300 --> 02:22:41,070
When it looks like a fish,
like when is it?

3149
02:22:41,071 --> 02:22:42,240
Okay,
when's it okay.

3150
02:22:42,280 --> 02:22:43,113
And that's all I'm saying.
I'm not saying you should or shouldn't 

3151
02:22:44,791 --> 02:22:47,130
be able to do it and it's definitely not
my choice.

3152
02:22:47,400 --> 02:22:49,230
I don't have a body that makes baby.

3153
02:22:49,390 --> 02:22:52,180
And do you think it starts at conception
or jerking off?

3154
02:22:52,181 --> 02:22:53,370
Killing millions of.

3155
02:22:54,190 --> 02:22:56,440
Because jerking off doesn't ever make 
that connection,

3156
02:22:56,441 --> 02:22:58,150
there's not,
it's not a viable.

3157
02:22:58,180 --> 02:23:00,370
So it is conception process that 
started.

3158
02:23:00,750 --> 02:23:03,070
I mean I don't necessarily think life 
starts at conception.

3159
02:23:03,071 --> 02:23:03,904
I mean I literally have.
I mean if someone can prove like if you 

3160
02:23:07,601 --> 02:23:09,700
had a Turkey tester that pops up when 
you're pregnant,

3161
02:23:09,701 --> 02:23:11,200
like the moment,
Oh shit,

3162
02:23:11,201 --> 02:23:13,500
we got one and you can just push that 
sucker down.

3163
02:23:13,510 --> 02:23:14,343
That egg would shoot out.
That fertilized egg would shoot out of 

3164
02:23:17,261 --> 02:23:18,820
your pussy and then that would be a 
wrap.

3165
02:23:19,330 --> 02:23:20,680
I got no problem with that.
Right?

3166
02:23:20,681 --> 02:23:22,790
I don't know a problem with any of it.
I mean I do.

3167
02:23:22,830 --> 02:23:23,663
I think intellectually I don't.
I wouldn't say I have a problem with it 

3168
02:23:26,351 --> 02:23:29,740
because again,
I submit that I don't have a vagina,

3169
02:23:29,741 --> 02:23:31,630
I don't have ovaries,
I don't have a womb.

3170
02:23:31,690 --> 02:23:35,950
I'm not making babies.
I have an opinion and that's it.

3171
02:23:35,980 --> 02:23:36,813
There's no way I should be able to say 
yes or no when I see it as this weird 

3172
02:23:39,371 --> 02:23:40,204
sort of a situation where we've figured 
out a way to terminate life inside the 

3173
02:23:44,561 --> 02:23:47,260
body where we can't see it yet.
It hasn't come out and said,

3174
02:23:47,261 --> 02:23:48,850
hi,
Hi Daddy.

3175
02:23:49,240 --> 02:23:51,850
It hasn't done that yet,
so we could hit the brakes.

3176
02:23:52,030 --> 02:23:52,750
Okay.
I don't want to.

3177
02:23:52,750 --> 02:23:53,800
I don't want to do it.
Whew.

3178
02:23:53,980 --> 02:23:56,710
We figured it out.
I don't think that there's.

3179
02:23:57,190 --> 02:23:59,440
I don't necessarily think it's wrong or 
right,

3180
02:23:59,980 --> 02:24:01,380
but it is a thing.
You know,

3181
02:24:01,490 --> 02:24:02,323
it's a thing and people require that you
speak of this thing in the way they 

3182
02:24:05,501 --> 02:24:08,920
speak of this thing and if you don't,
they are fucking ready to Duke.

3183
02:24:09,100 --> 02:24:10,650
They're ready to duke it out with you.
I,

3184
02:24:10,790 --> 02:24:11,320
I.

3185
02:24:11,320 --> 02:24:15,830
because the differentiation is the pro 
choice.

3186
02:24:16,420 --> 02:24:17,253
People are saying it's not a life and 
the other people are saying you're 

3187
02:24:20,291 --> 02:24:23,580
killing a living thing.
A person and I'm,

3188
02:24:23,650 --> 02:24:25,030
I'm in there where it's like,
no,

3189
02:24:25,031 --> 02:24:28,960
you are killing something,
but it's not a person now yet.

3190
02:24:29,110 --> 02:24:31,650
So I agree with both.
Right.

3191
02:24:31,750 --> 02:24:32,583
You know,
but fundamentally I agree with what you 

3192
02:24:35,021 --> 02:24:35,854
just said,
which is it's really none of my fucking 

3193
02:24:37,361 --> 02:24:38,194
business.
It's not my body and no woman can tell 

3194
02:24:40,421 --> 02:24:41,254
me whether you get a vasectomy or not or
the prostate exam or whatever the fuck 

3195
02:24:44,261 --> 02:24:45,094
it is.
They just passed a law in Arkansas or 

3196
02:24:47,041 --> 02:24:47,874
somewhere that husbands need to be 
informed before woman can have an 

3197
02:24:50,801 --> 02:24:54,100
abortion and a husband can stop it even 
if she's been raped.

3198
02:24:55,060 --> 02:24:59,380
That's medieval.
That's ownership person.

3199
02:24:59,580 --> 02:25:01,140
Yeah.
A husband or a wife.

3200
02:25:01,170 --> 02:25:02,003
Being able to tell the other one what 
they can or can't do with a medical 

3201
02:25:04,561 --> 02:25:05,700
procedure.
That's illegal.

3202
02:25:06,090 --> 02:25:06,923
That becomes like an owner.
That definitely becomes an ownership 

3203
02:25:08,371 --> 02:25:09,204
issue.
Like if your wife told you you couldn't 

3204
02:25:09,781 --> 02:25:12,060
get a vasectomy,
I will not allow it,

3205
02:25:12,150 --> 02:25:14,910
but what?
I will not allow you to eat meat either.

3206
02:25:15,480 --> 02:25:17,700
I will not allow you to have ice cream 
fat.

3207
02:25:17,701 --> 02:25:18,590
Fuck.
No.

3208
02:25:18,650 --> 02:25:21,350
Like all of a sudden she decides what 
you're going to eat out.

3209
02:25:21,370 --> 02:25:22,890
It will not allow you to keep that 
haircut.

3210
02:25:23,160 --> 02:25:24,040
Ryan.
That way all

3211
02:25:24,040 --> 02:25:25,420
the time.
Oh,

3212
02:25:25,421 --> 02:25:27,280
I would never let my husband buy blah 
blah.

3213
02:25:27,290 --> 02:25:29,560
Like what?
Your husband's a pussy.

3214
02:25:33,370 --> 02:25:34,570
Yeah.
Well,

3215
02:25:34,571 --> 02:25:38,420
and your wife is under threat or in,
you know,

3216
02:25:38,440 --> 02:25:41,590
under ownership.
If she allows the same sort of situation

3217
02:25:41,600 --> 02:25:43,940
like guy makes her do things.
Yeah.

3218
02:25:44,070 --> 02:25:44,903
I've known people that are.
Their husbands have made them get 

3219
02:25:47,171 --> 02:25:49,830
plastic surgery.
Yeah.

3220
02:25:49,890 --> 02:25:50,560
Yeah,
yeah,

3221
02:25:50,560 --> 02:25:51,910
talk him into it.
You know,

3222
02:25:51,970 --> 02:25:54,700
I want you to do this for me.
Get the big tits.

3223
02:25:54,850 --> 02:25:55,750
Yeah,
get the lips,

3224
02:25:56,250 --> 02:25:59,050
lips,
the lips to do something by your nose.

3225
02:25:59,051 --> 02:26:00,520
I don't like your nose.
Bothered me.

3226
02:26:00,850 --> 02:26:01,790
You'd be prettier,
baby.

3227
02:26:01,850 --> 02:26:03,360
I'll show you off.
Weird,

3228
02:26:03,510 --> 02:26:04,690
weird.
You fix your notes.

3229
02:26:04,691 --> 02:26:07,690
And then there are those people who like
who like fatties,

3230
02:26:07,720 --> 02:26:08,810
you know?
Then the,

3231
02:26:08,900 --> 02:26:12,760
they feed the other person.
It's part of their eroticism to feed you

3232
02:26:12,761 --> 02:26:15,770
as much as possible so you get as fat 
because I love you and getting,

3233
02:26:15,771 --> 02:26:16,900
you know,
it's not cool.

3234
02:26:17,170 --> 02:26:19,660
Very strange.
People are fucking weird man.

3235
02:26:20,690 --> 02:26:21,523
You know,
I don't think hunter gatherers are 

3236
02:26:22,691 --> 02:26:24,250
kinky.
No,

3237
02:26:24,330 --> 02:26:25,630
no.
This is the thing.

3238
02:26:25,631 --> 02:26:30,631
I think kink is a response to a fucked 
up environment.

3239
02:26:31,510 --> 02:26:36,040
So I think yeah,
it's this weird pressure.

3240
02:26:36,041 --> 02:26:39,220
It's conflict between the impulse and 
what's allowed.

3241
02:26:39,221 --> 02:26:41,410
So it comes out in this weird,
distorted way.

3242
02:26:41,620 --> 02:26:43,910
I think that makes total sense.
So yeah,

3243
02:26:43,950 --> 02:26:45,550
hunter gatherers,
there's not,

3244
02:26:45,670 --> 02:26:48,940
as far as I know,
there's no evidence of Kink,

3245
02:26:49,060 --> 02:26:50,920
tarred to get latex.
Let's face it,

3246
02:26:51,100 --> 02:26:51,933
the jungle,
although that's where it comes from 

3247
02:26:52,901 --> 02:26:55,240
originally.
If you've ever met Wade Davis,

3248
02:26:55,241 --> 02:26:56,074
by the way.
No,

3249
02:26:56,680 --> 02:26:58,960
you should meet that guy who is 
fascinating.

3250
02:26:58,961 --> 02:27:02,380
I just had him on my podcast.
He's an ethnobotanist.

3251
02:27:02,560 --> 02:27:04,450
She live around here.
He lives in Vancouver.

3252
02:27:05,110 --> 02:27:06,390
Um,
but he's an author.

3253
02:27:06,391 --> 02:27:07,960
He,
I'm sure he comes to la regularly,

3254
02:27:07,961 --> 02:27:09,060
but,
uh,

3255
02:27:09,070 --> 02:27:12,010
he's the guy actually we were talking 
about five Meo dmt.

3256
02:27:12,010 --> 02:27:15,310
He was,
he and Andrew Weil isolated that for the

3257
02:27:15,311 --> 02:27:17,260
first time,
uh,

3258
02:27:17,290 --> 02:27:19,060
as white people.
Anyway,

3259
02:27:19,450 --> 02:27:20,283
he studied at Harvard.
Then he went to the Amazon for a long 

3260
02:27:22,901 --> 02:27:24,460
time.
He worked,

3261
02:27:24,470 --> 02:27:25,303
lived with a lot of tribes.
They're very interested in 

3262
02:27:27,281 --> 02:27:29,860
hallucinogens.
He's written a bunch of books.

3263
02:27:29,861 --> 02:27:32,170
His first book was about Voodoo,
um,

3264
02:27:32,470 --> 02:27:35,860
something about the horsemen of the 
apocalypse or something like that.

3265
02:27:36,310 --> 02:27:39,820
He wrote a book called one river.
He's written seven or eight books.

3266
02:27:39,821 --> 02:27:42,670
He's a national geographic explorer in 
residence.

3267
02:27:42,671 --> 02:27:44,980
He's the super bad ass dude.
Damn.

3268
02:27:45,010 --> 02:27:45,843
I told one of his stories on your 
podcast a long time ago about this 

3269
02:27:48,461 --> 02:27:51,640
Eskimo Dude,
old guy in the family said,

3270
02:27:51,641 --> 02:27:52,570
Grandpa,
you know,

3271
02:27:52,571 --> 02:27:56,830
we get to take away the keys to the snow
machine because you can't see so well,

3272
02:27:57,340 --> 02:27:58,480
and he's like,
fuck you guys.

3273
02:27:58,481 --> 02:28:01,930
In that night he went out,
it was winter in the Arctic somewhere.

3274
02:28:02,050 --> 02:28:02,883
He took a shit and he fashioned a blade 
from his shit out of the snow and well 

3275
02:28:08,140 --> 02:28:08,973
he killed the dogs and he made a harness
out of the dog's skin and a little sled 

3276
02:28:13,421 --> 02:28:14,254
out of the dog's ribs.
And then he like tied in three or four 

3277
02:28:18,041 --> 02:28:21,560
other dogs and then he fucking took a 
took off across Tundra.

3278
02:28:22,250 --> 02:28:23,720
Anyway,
that's a way David's story.

3279
02:28:23,721 --> 02:28:24,580
He's like,
he.

3280
02:28:24,610 --> 02:28:28,180
So he made a knife out of his own chef.
He froze his night.

3281
02:28:28,700 --> 02:28:29,533
He,
he forms the blade and then he took 

3282
02:28:32,270 --> 02:28:33,103
some.
He freezes and then he takes them spit 

3283
02:28:35,301 --> 02:28:36,134
and he rubs it along the edge and 
apparently that's what gives it the 

3284
02:28:38,630 --> 02:28:39,900
razor sharpness.
Yeah.

3285
02:28:40,400 --> 02:28:43,160
And then he fucking kills his dog with a
shit knife.

3286
02:28:43,760 --> 02:28:44,780
That's right.
I remember that.

3287
02:28:44,781 --> 02:28:46,490
There's another story,
Davis,

3288
02:28:46,700 --> 02:28:47,533
how I bought Zombie poison in America 
inside the eclectic quarter of award 

3289
02:28:50,781 --> 02:28:51,614
winning writer Wade Davis,
former national geographic explorer in 

3290
02:28:54,441 --> 02:28:55,340
residence,
ethno,

3291
02:28:55,341 --> 02:28:57,970
botanists and park ranger is a super 
cool guy.

3292
02:28:58,100 --> 02:28:59,750
Christ what?
A life that guys lived.

3293
02:29:00,440 --> 02:29:01,640
Yeah.
Yeah.

3294
02:29:01,670 --> 02:29:02,990
He's A.
Again,

3295
02:29:03,020 --> 02:29:05,130
that's the guy like I want to fucking 
meet these galleries.

3296
02:29:05,131 --> 02:29:06,680
Yeah.
Yeah.

3297
02:29:06,710 --> 02:29:08,900
So he's cool.
He's up in Vancouver.

3298
02:29:09,050 --> 02:29:09,711
Well,
listen man.

3299
02:29:09,711 --> 02:29:11,170
Unfortunately I got a book.
Yeah,

3300
02:29:11,200 --> 02:29:13,190
we can do this alone to time though,
man.

3301
02:29:13,190 --> 02:29:15,900
You're a.
you're in the back in the states.

3302
02:29:16,300 --> 02:29:17,930
I am.
I got nothing to sell.

3303
02:29:18,020 --> 02:29:20,360
I had no.
Doesn't matter,

3304
02:29:20,361 --> 02:29:21,194
man.
Lazy Hippie lifestyle that will promote 

3305
02:29:22,551 --> 02:29:24,440
your podcast.
Tangentially speaking.

3306
02:29:24,441 --> 02:29:26,330
So hilarious.
Awesome podcast.

3307
02:29:26,690 --> 02:29:29,060
And you do it fairly recently?
Fairly often.

3308
02:29:29,090 --> 02:29:29,990
Every week.
Every week.

3309
02:29:29,991 --> 02:29:30,824
Okay,
cool.

3310
02:29:30,920 --> 02:29:32,540
That's awesome.
And let's do this more often.

3311
02:29:32,541 --> 02:29:33,261
Dude.
Year round.

3312
02:29:33,261 --> 02:29:36,830
I'm here and it's that Chris Ryan.
Now.

3313
02:29:36,831 --> 02:29:38,780
It used to be Chris Ryan,
phd on twitter,

3314
02:29:38,781 --> 02:29:43,670
but Duncan trussell fucking ruined him.
And Brendan Walsh,

3315
02:29:43,671 --> 02:29:45,590
they stole my phd.
Those fuckers,

3316
02:29:45,830 --> 02:29:49,820
they put phd next to their name.
Now Phd doesn't mean anything anymore,

3317
02:29:49,850 --> 02:29:52,330
so that Chris Ryan.
Thanks brother was awesome,

3318
02:29:52,331 --> 02:29:52,731
man.
Yeah,

3319
02:29:52,731 --> 02:29:53,990
you too.
See you guys.

3320
02:29:54,020 --> 02:29:54,853
Bye.
