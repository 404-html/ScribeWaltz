1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:03,540
Hello Freak bitches.
So,

2
00:00:03,541 --> 00:00:05,070
uh,
when you would shake his hand,

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,190
shake it like that.
He has like a little little hook.

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,770
I'm like a baby finger.
Yeah.

5
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:13,050
It's like constantly,
that was a toe that was a toe.

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,850
It's a toe,
but now it's his index finger.

7
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,310
But he had his toe.
Yeah.

8
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:19,830
Yeah.
His foot,

9
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,890
his foot only has was four toes as a 
toe,

10
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:28,040
the big toe and then three hangers and 
somebody bid it off in a CC fight.

11
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,060
Yeah.
Oh that reminds me,

12
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,740
that reminds me so much fun that I was 
with Diaz for three days.

13
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,420
Yes.
And we're the,

14
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,980
I'll tell you why because this is so 
perfect.

15
00:00:43,981 --> 00:00:44,814
So I'm with the,
as we're leaving the shoreline 

16
00:00:46,261 --> 00:00:48,030
amphitheater,
we did the odd ball tour.

17
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,640
So we're leaving the shoreline 
amphitheatre he just,

18
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,750
he massacred,
he,

19
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,640
you know,
it was like close to 10,000

20
00:00:53,641 --> 00:00:57,870
people we get in the shuttle because 
there's intermission and joey and I were

21
00:00:57,871 --> 00:00:58,740
before intermission.

22
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,560
So we tell the driver we want to go back
to hotel.

23
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:03,840
There's still another half of show to 
go.

24
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,780
So it was just joey,
myself,

25
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,000
and the driver.
And we get in the car,

26
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,013
there's no music on,
we're just talking and we just hit one 

27
00:01:12,451 --> 00:01:13,284
of those moments.
You know when you're on a highway at 

28
00:01:14,191 --> 00:01:17,580
night and you kind of hit that thing 
where it's like you just,

29
00:01:17,581 --> 00:01:18,414
everyone stops talking for a minute and 
you're looking out the window and you 

30
00:01:21,061 --> 00:01:24,120
can feel like I'm just kind of staring 
off.

31
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:25,373
No one's talking.
And then after like 15 seconds of 

32
00:01:27,961 --> 00:01:29,010
silence,
Joey goes,

33
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:35,390
that would tell you about the time I saw
a guy cut open at the tenderloin in 1979

34
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,410
his stomach split wide open and I was 
like,

35
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:41,070
what?
And I just see the driver's eyes widened

36
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,120
and I was like,
no.

37
00:01:42,121 --> 00:01:42,571
He goes,
yeah,

38
00:01:42,571 --> 00:01:45,210
it's blood was brown because he was 
bleeding for so long.

39
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,073
People just stepped over him and I saw 
two guys stab each other in the fucking 

40
00:01:49,951 --> 00:01:54,390
street,
1980 just over nothing.

41
00:01:54,391 --> 00:01:55,720
They just stab each other.
I didn't know.

42
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:56,563
I almost shit my pants but then I got 
used to it and then you just see the 

43
00:01:59,371 --> 00:02:02,940
drag.
It was just crazy.

44
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,013
I got used to it.
Just look over like who's this guy I'm 

45
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,950
sitting next to me,
which is all you saw from like uh,

46
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,113
he was,
he's such a like a rocket ship of a 

47
00:02:13,921 --> 00:02:14,754
personality that you get used to like 
all the people on this tour because I 

48
00:02:17,941 --> 00:02:18,774
did all the dates and then they you,
cause you should see like the first 

49
00:02:20,881 --> 00:02:21,714
night he came out I'd see the like the 
odd ball staff like turning and like 

50
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:29,690
what the fuck is going on because his,
he's just so out of left field,

51
00:02:30,571 --> 00:02:32,070
you know,
you can't prepare for it.

52
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:35,700
And he's just like,
he's got not a fucking his tank.

53
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:41,100
There's nothing just cause people cock 
suckers like the audience,

54
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:43,320
what's up cock suckers.
They're like,

55
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,290
who the fuck he did it to 8,000
people last night.

56
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,090
What's up?
You fucking cock suckers.

57
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:51,330
Yeah,
it's endearing.

58
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:53,070
See of live.
Yeah.

59
00:02:53,071 --> 00:02:55,260
He even asked,
he has like some reference to it.

60
00:02:55,261 --> 00:02:56,420
Like he knew that he,
he cause he,

61
00:02:56,421 --> 00:02:58,110
he would throw people off.
Right.

62
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,470
You could tell that some people they'd 
be like,

63
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,030
oh my God.
And then he goes,

64
00:03:01,031 --> 00:03:02,410
yeah,
I say some fucked up shit.

65
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,830
And then,
and then he goes,

66
00:03:05,831 --> 00:03:06,760
but me,
uncle Joey,

67
00:03:06,761 --> 00:03:08,650
you know everyone's got an uncle joey 
like me.

68
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:11,050
It's a little uncomfortable at first,
like a finger in your ass.

69
00:03:11,051 --> 00:03:13,030
And then they just like laughing again 
right away.

70
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,220
He gets how he hits people,
you know?

71
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:18,520
Yeah.
He's something odd.

72
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:21,040
I've never been anybody like him before.

73
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:25,240
It's a force of nature.
It's like a rare occurrence.

74
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,160
Really owns his farts in public.
It really sparked game strong.

75
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,540
He dropped.
He was just like,

76
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,750
I gotta tell you something else,
mom at a bar.

77
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:38,920
I was like so loud and it smelled so 
sour.

78
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:40,063
And he goes,
wait until it hits that motherfucker 

79
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:44,370
points at the guy.
Yeah,

80
00:03:44,371 --> 00:03:45,280
man.
It's crazy,

81
00:03:45,281 --> 00:03:46,570
man.
It's so crazy.

82
00:03:46,571 --> 00:03:48,670
He's married.
He's,

83
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:53,410
he wants on a plane that was so bad that
I head phones on and I smelled.

84
00:03:53,411 --> 00:03:55,090
I was in the middle of writing and I 
smelled it.

85
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:57,920
And I just go,
oh right.

86
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:02,710
And then I start to make this face and 
then I go and I put my shirt and my nose

87
00:04:02,711 --> 00:04:03,544
is terrible,
and then it hits the woman behind us 

88
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,850
with the headphones.
I'm listening to music.

89
00:04:06,851 --> 00:04:09,740
I hear,
Oh my God.

90
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:23,610
Oh my God.
He's got his hands rested.

91
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:27,860
Yeah.
Yeah.

92
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,890
He's amazing.
He got credit for it too.

93
00:04:29,891 --> 00:04:31,030
Definitely.
Yeah.

94
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,970
Cause I do it on planes,
but I keep it private.

95
00:04:33,971 --> 00:04:36,530
I don't obtain credit and no one assumes
I would.

96
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:37,540
Right.
So I like to,

97
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,583
plus the sound.
It's so much on the plane that you can 

98
00:04:40,121 --> 00:04:42,400
fart and you can just let it rip.
No one's going to hear it.

99
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:43,960
Yeah.
It's good quality.

100
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:44,803
Yeah.
He also says things that don't add up 

101
00:04:47,261 --> 00:04:48,220
for that.
Like he would like,

102
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:48,731
he,
I'm like,

103
00:04:48,731 --> 00:04:49,271
come on.
He goes,

104
00:04:49,271 --> 00:04:52,290
you know me dog.
All right.

105
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:55,720
It's like my favorite thing about his 
periscopes,

106
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:57,880
periscopes,
he'll smoke,

107
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:00,070
you know,
crazy amounts of weed.

108
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:01,660
He's like,
at six o'clock in the morning,

109
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:03,910
I've always like rolled two joints,
smoked him.

110
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,140
Fuck,
are you doing with your life?

111
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:06,880
And I'm like,
I go,

112
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,950
you're lying.
That's the accomplishment.

113
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,150
Like I'm doing something.
What are you doing?

114
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,280
Okay.
Okay.
