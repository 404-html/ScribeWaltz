1
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:08,360
What do you think that maybe they hired
Donald Trump because they knew there was

2
00:00:08,361 --> 00:00:10,050
so many Republicans that are shitheads.

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,160
They could just get him to the podium and
then he would crumble under the weight

4
00:00:14,161 --> 00:00:18,740
of Hillary Clinton. It's the greatest
professional wrestling act ever, ever.

5
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:23,580
Really is
gone to build

6
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:27,150
it's crazy hair.

7
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:32,370
Could you imagine given that due to pot
cookie and a mirror and go, hey bro,

8
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:37,830
what's going on up here? What is this?
What's going on? What are you doing?

9
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:41,220
This is, this is madness.
If you have, you know,

10
00:00:41,221 --> 00:00:44,250
you just go like short trimmed
hair with some bald spots.

11
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:47,520
That's way more gangster than what
you're doing. Like what you're doing.

12
00:00:47,521 --> 00:00:49,950
It's kind of crazy.
Hair does not look like that.

13
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,620
It just doesn't look like
that ever in the wild.

14
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:58,910
It just like what you've done is you've
used some sort of chemicals to concoct

15
00:00:59,071 --> 00:01:02,040
something and his face.
Is it really that?

16
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:05,820
Is that the lading or is it
really that red and orange?

17
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:09,240
They do him up in the kind of people that
do him up or probably like the kind of

18
00:01:09,241 --> 00:01:11,910
people that really like him and
they kind of like some orange skin.

19
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:15,690
They want to fight both of them.
It's warping that they want to fight.

20
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:21,930
It's white people warpaint

21
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,030
but why doesn't he do the under eyes?
Like if you're going to do your whole,

22
00:01:30,031 --> 00:01:30,960
your face like that.

23
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:33,690
Do you think he wears like giant goggles
when he gets in the tanning booth?

24
00:01:33,691 --> 00:01:35,830
Is that what's going on?
Like why is this a

25
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:41,700
eyes just white? Surely he knows
what he looks like. Right? But then,

26
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:44,670
but then you look at his hair and you
go, well why is he doing that? Then.
