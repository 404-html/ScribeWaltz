43
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:17,503
It's terrifying.

44
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:23,370
Humanity has ever produced
you have a worm in your brain.

45
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,390
They tried nature's pick.

53
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:46,890
I won't go too far.

54
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,150

Someone making this.

60
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,110
They're going to make this the
features on their myspace page.

61
00:02:00,111 --> 00:02:02,620
I didn't answer called the um,

62
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,020

circuits are busy now.

65
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:09,711
Right?

66
00:02:09,711 --> 00:02:11,210
What does that song you made with your ex?

67
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:12,560
Can you make a song with your ex?

68
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,130
Yeah.

69
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:13,851
What's that one about?

70
00:02:13,851 --> 00:02:14,684
It was kind of a good one.

71
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,673
What was it?

72
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,250
What was it about?

73
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:16,580
Well,

74
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,530
there's the one who I'm punching the dog.

75
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:19,820
Is that what the one you're
talking about it now,

76
00:02:19,821 --> 00:02:20,421
but it was good.

77
00:02:20,421 --> 00:02:21,080
It was fun.

78
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:21,680
Uh Oh,

79
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,580
Juno Ish.

80
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,630
Juno Ish.

81
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:23,811
Yeah.

82
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:25,850
That's actually just a remake of a song.

83
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:26,331
Oh,

84
00:02:26,331 --> 00:02:27,560
don't do that because
you don't have rights.

85
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,240
But there was the other one.

86
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,580
The other one's punching the
dog was about punching my door.

87
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:34,920
Do you think that's funny man?

88
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,350
Yeah.

89
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:36,183
Yeah.

90
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:39,561
Play that one.

91
00:02:39,561 --> 00:02:41,060
John is good or should we not play it?

92
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:41,923
Maybe we should all night.

93
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:42,350
Good.

94
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:44,620
They're all my stupid songs right now.

95
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,520
I don't want to leave people disappointed.

96
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,533
Okay,

97
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:48,920
well not going to work.

98
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,710
I wish I could've heard it.

99
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:50,970
They're going to think
it's better than it was.

100
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,790
They're going to leave now thinking
that I missed out on something good.

101
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:54,900
Would reality folks,

102
00:02:54,901 --> 00:02:56,430
is it shut off your iPhone?

103
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,083
Shut off.

104
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,200
Disconnect from you stream.

105
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:05,680
Please don't listen to what
we're doing here right now.

106
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:10,060
Cause you to waste your time.

107
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,410
This is right.

108
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:14,200
You crack rock clicking on the link.

109
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:15,573
It's

110
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,071
okay.

111
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:17,760
Stop.

112
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,650
Terrible.

113
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,140
This is worse than the other one.

114
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,870
This is where pulled up,

115
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:22,280
man.

116
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,090
Please stop it along with your own song.

117
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:26,650
That's terrible,

118
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:27,483
bro.

119
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:28,380
Like it.

120
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:28,880
No.

121
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:28,980
Well,

122
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,000
I could play the January song.

123
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:30,540
Nope.

124
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:30,720
Nope.

125
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,530
That's no copyright.

126
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:32,221
That's actually really good.

127
00:03:32,221 --> 00:03:32,790
They were good.

128
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:33,301
That's really good.

129
00:03:33,301 --> 00:03:33,601
That's it.

130
00:03:33,601 --> 00:03:34,190
That's a wrap,

131
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:34,680
right?

132
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,513
Cause the end of the show.

133
00:03:58,770 --> 00:03:59,603
Okay.

134
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,380
Hello.

135
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:10,860
Hello.
