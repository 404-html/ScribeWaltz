1
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:06,210
H J o with the pants.
Anjo pants hand John.

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:09,840
Did he just make that up? I'm just
waiting for the right fucking time.

3
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:16,980
That's hilarious. All Right
Ladies and gentlemen, this
is now where it's official.

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:22,050
Yeah, I said it sounds
professional. Someone who
said, I have a radio voice. Oh,

5
00:00:22,051 --> 00:00:26,450
Donald Cowboy was like, uh, I, you got a
radio voice and that's your radio voice.

6
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:27,840
Donald Cowboy Cerrone.

7
00:00:27,841 --> 00:00:31,290
He's a guy fights in the UFC and he was
here for the podcast the other day and

8
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:34,080
he sent me, accused me of having
a radio voice. Now think about it.

9
00:00:34,081 --> 00:00:37,700
Fuck do I even delicate voice.
Why is that a bad thing?

10
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:39,990
That's a compliment.
Well,

11
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,950
I recognize that the instrument
has a bunch of different
sounds that it can make.

12
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:48,450
What is, what is one of the reasons why
I appreciate music? I appreciate music.

13
00:00:48,451 --> 00:00:49,680
I mean,
I've told you the guys this before,

14
00:00:49,681 --> 00:00:52,200
like one of the things I love about
what you guys do is I have zero talent.

15
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:56,310
Like I love something that I have now.
Like where I don't know anything about it.

16
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:00,000
I love music. I'm a huge
fan. I know nothing about it.

17
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,850
When you guys started talking about
bars and notes and I'm like Blah Blah.

18
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,320
I have no idea where you're
saying we don't either.

19
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:10,430
Do you, are you like, cause
you use her voice a lot,

20
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:13,660
you know when you're on stage and you use
it in different registers and, and you,

21
00:01:13,661 --> 00:01:17,300
you know, you podcasts. Do you like,
have you ever had problems with it? No.

22
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:20,100
That's amazing.
Screaming too.

23
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,760
I know you hear a lot of Comedians,

24
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:26,400
I think. Well you could do it
without fucking use your thing up.

25
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:30,500
Well the UFC is the weirdest one.
I fucking scream sometimes.

26
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:35,320
I don't even know I'm doing it in Tom
doing it. Like sometimes I'm standing up,

27
00:01:35,321 --> 00:01:38,500
I don't even know him up.
Like I'm standing up, I'm
doing cart. Like there was a,

28
00:01:38,501 --> 00:01:41,030
our Lawsky um, and um, uh,

29
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:44,770
Travis Brown fight this crazy fight
between these two giant guys who are

30
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,210
painting the fuck out of each other.

31
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:50,080
They kept getting dropped like over
into like our Laskey dropped him,

32
00:01:50,081 --> 00:01:54,250
but I think three times and he kept
getting up and then he dropped our Lawsky.

33
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:57,220
And there are lot of came back and knocked
him out and by the end of the fight I

34
00:01:57,221 --> 00:01:59,740
was standing up screaming
and I just shut it off.

35
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,690
I had to realize I didn't
and my pants first,

36
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,560
I didn't know I was up until I was like,
well was fucking standing up.

37
00:02:05,561 --> 00:02:07,900
I don't even know. I've, I've only
done that a couple of times, right.

38
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,150
Just all of a sudden I'm standing.
Okay.

39
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,840
The fact that you can scream and you don't
lose your voice I think is remarkable

40
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:16,620
because it's like,
I bet back when I was bartending,

41
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:21,150
I lose my voice all the time just from
trying to, you know, raise your volume.

42
00:02:21,151 --> 00:02:23,610
And so yeah. But when I,
when I quit bartending,

43
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,790
my voice went up like an octave and I had
it, but I had to go to speech therapy.

44
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:29,050
So I learned all these things about
like how old were you back then?

45
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:33,580
Was that when you set up an octave,
does them, is that like there's a,

46
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:37,820
an actual nurse for singing?
I wasn't like speaking in enough that

47
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:41,890
well those old ladies that you
hear about by the old bar lady,

48
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:47,230
who's that girl sue Bob from the whites
of West Virginia, they Budweiser. Boy.

49
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,160
I always been the sexy one in the family.
If you've ever seen that,

50
00:02:50,161 --> 00:02:53,160
you haven't seen it. Oh God. Oh my God.
No, you've never seen it. Never went.

51
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:57,590
The wonderful whites of West Virginia
got everyone talks about, oh my top two.

52
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,550
Tell us about this mosque.
Nashville.

53
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:02,840
Everybody required viewing.
Who wants to be seen?

54
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:05,950
You can't shut the fuck up about it. Yeah.
Cause you're like, Yo, I think it was,

55
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,850
wasn't Johnny Knoxville was
it his amazing, amazing.

56
00:03:09,851 --> 00:03:13,390
It's just a really well done documentary.
Not just freaky people,

57
00:03:13,391 --> 00:03:17,890
but it's all that bar, that bar
voice. They got that bar votes.

58
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:18,850
Yes.

59
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:23,530
Sega ranch and Jeremy and cigarettes.
Booze and yelling and there's a,

60
00:03:23,531 --> 00:03:27,610
there's a sexiness to it though. There's
like, there's definitely like a, Oh wow,

61
00:03:27,611 --> 00:03:31,380
that person has fun. You know,
and I, I, I've definitely like I,

62
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:35,650
I like having a raspy voice but
also like no, that it's just damage.

63
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:38,480
So I'm not super pumped about it.
At the same time,

64
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,140
really attracted to voices like that.
In general though.

65
00:03:41,141 --> 00:03:44,590
You listen like Otis Redding. Yeah.
He's got a battered fucking voice. Yeah.

66
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:49,030
Janice Joplin. How about Petkoski?
Okay. That was of his half of his thing.

67
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:54,050
Barn and do this. Yeah. When
you trust that this thing like,

68
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:57,190
oh yeah, yeah, but I also think
it was his like good way of thing.

69
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:02,080
It's like some people have that incredible
ability to like channel there person

70
00:04:02,081 --> 00:04:04,960
through this incredible voice like
Bukovsky or something like that and like,

71
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:07,360
you know,
so they're easier to listen to.

72
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:11,610
Well, bootcamp skis, poems were
always just raw and interesting,

73
00:04:11,611 --> 00:04:15,180
but there are nothing like when he
read them, especially when you saw it,

74
00:04:15,181 --> 00:04:16,200
there's like for him,

75
00:04:16,201 --> 00:04:21,201
he's one of the rare poets that I think
the visual aspect like enhances it

76
00:04:21,251 --> 00:04:25,940
significantly. Like, I would love
one of my favorite, uh, there's a, a,

77
00:04:25,941 --> 00:04:28,200
a bunch of videos of him,
uh,

78
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,640
at like these readings and he would sit
in front of these audiences and we drink

79
00:04:32,641 --> 00:04:35,810
wine and knew would get fucked up.
And if people were talking,

80
00:04:35,811 --> 00:04:36,690
you would yell at them,

81
00:04:36,691 --> 00:04:41,190
I'll come over there right now and
I'll beat the fucking shit out of you.

82
00:04:41,191 --> 00:04:43,950
And he was this old drunk man,
but he was just,

83
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:47,490
and he really would have Donna
theaudience and fought people.

84
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:52,440
And then he would read this like really
intense stuff that he wrote about life

85
00:04:52,441 --> 00:04:56,550
and mortality and his, you
know, vision of humanity.

86
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:01,110
It's so hard to get people
to care about poetry.

87
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,270
So I think that's how you do it,
kind of. It's Adam, you Kinda,

88
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:08,340
you're taking such a crazy chance
to even say you wrote a poem.

89
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:11,610
They tell someone hammering
home, nobody goes, yeah,

90
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:15,530
the fucking awesome dude.
That's,

91
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,800
he knows most of the time when someone
says, uh, I've, uh, wrote a poem,

92
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:21,480
I'd like you to read it. Like, Nah.

93
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:27,330
Like if someone says they have a song,
I'm like, oh, I love songs. Someone says,

94
00:05:27,331 --> 00:05:31,120
Dude, or the best joke, oh, I can't
wait to hear it. I got the best poems,

95
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:36,990
poems, it. Sure. Oh Man. Right.

96
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:41,460
The best poet of the bore and the
best poem is a chore. The best,

97
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:45,940
the very best little poetry right there.
Just write

98
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:52,980
the small work and lay that shit on us.
But when people,

99
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:56,490
when there is a visual element,
it's amazing. You know,
Spalding gray. Yeah, yeah.

100
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:57,680
That's,
yeah.

101
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,560
Ooh, I don't remember. I don't know.

102
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:05,000
But he did that swimming to Cambodia
stuff and it's him telling these stories

103
00:06:05,001 --> 00:06:09,920
and it's really poetic. Um, I'm not,
but it's a storytelling element.

104
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,740
You don't all of a sudden we want to
listen to, I want to listen to it.

105
00:06:12,741 --> 00:06:16,820
I think it's fucking, how about Eric
Bogosian? I Dunno who that dude is. He,

106
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,450
I think, um, I think, yeah,
Spalding gray. I did do that.

107
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:24,770
He was having some health issues
and he wound up killing himself.

108
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:27,060
But Eric [inaudible] goes,
he was a guy who, um,

109
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,050
actually he was doing like more
like one man shows. Well that goes,

110
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:33,840
you always had a bunch of
movies for a while, but he,

111
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,720
he actually did some acting too,

112
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:40,520
but he did like these one man show
things I want to see. He was a reading,

113
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:44,540
I want to say. They were like really
well done readings too that he did.

114
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,360
But Spalding gray was guy was
like more known for it. Right.

115
00:06:47,361 --> 00:06:49,000
Cause he sat down at the table.
Yeah.

116
00:06:49,001 --> 00:06:52,730
He had his desk and even had like a real
theatrical vibe lights would be going

117
00:06:52,731 --> 00:06:54,390
on.
Yeah.

118
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,940
It's sad when you hear about a garlic
that killed himself cause you're like fuck

119
00:06:58,941 --> 00:07:01,730
dude.
You know all these people liked you

120
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:07,840
when he died. Well he was famous
enough that we're talking about yeah.

121
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,170
And that community,
I'm sure he's,

122
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,280
he was reasonably well known for sure.

123
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:15,950
And at the time he had
been on TV quite a bit,

124
00:07:15,951 --> 00:07:19,430
which is where Ben and I
probably saw him first. Right.

125
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:22,540
That's why I'm on the Youtube.
Um, cause he had got series,

126
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,150
like who's the filmmaker?
Um,

127
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:27,860
guy did a lot of concert films and
I can't remember his name right now,

128
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,400
but in the 60s he was,
he was at like a,

129
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:34,460
he was taking Hendricks footage and he
was taking a lot of festival footage in

130
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:37,640
the 60s, which nobody was really doing
at that time. Or at least nowhere near

131
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:44,840
the rounder stuff. Lomax
Lomax. No, he was molded great.

132
00:07:44,841 --> 00:07:47,050
I think his heyday was like the 80s,
late seventies,

133
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:52,100
like swimming to Cambodia was 87 but
who's the guy who did the film with

134
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:58,790
Cambodia who directed it and see
here, hold on cause he did this. Um,

135
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:03,950
I think the Toronto Peace
Festival, this fucking amazing.
Jonathan Demi. Demi. Yeah.

136
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:09,290
I swear you go home. You're faster than
me. Bastard. I have it too. It was trying.

137
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,350
Yeah. Um, yeah. So you, yeah, that was a,

138
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:16,010
he was apparently it was about
his participation in the movie,

139
00:08:16,011 --> 00:08:19,210
the killing fields. I didn't know that
he had anything to do with that. Yeah.

140
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:22,370
When all these beautiful stories,
I mean it's not much about the production,

141
00:08:22,371 --> 00:08:26,080
it's about his experiences.
He just Kinda like took shit pretty,

142
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:30,410
he was an extreme or kind of like a
radical liver right now and just a great

143
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,170
storyteller,
which is super rare I think.

144
00:08:33,171 --> 00:08:36,120
I mean it seems like mainly that rent,

145
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,330
that's kind of the comedians realm now.

146
00:08:38,331 --> 00:08:40,700
Like people don't give a shit
about storytellers, but people,

147
00:08:40,701 --> 00:08:43,550
if you're a comedian you
could tell us a story. Well,

148
00:08:43,551 --> 00:08:48,050
I think in a way the problem
is like trying to sell this
just like we're talking

149
00:08:48,051 --> 00:08:49,340
about like selling poetry,

150
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:52,820
selling a guy who's like doing
a one man show or one man story.

151
00:08:52,821 --> 00:08:56,190
It's hard but essentially
like a lot of podcasts

152
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,920
are like that. Yeah,
we're stand up, stand up,

153
00:08:58,921 --> 00:09:01,820
stand up can be anything and
a lot of ways, yeah, but the,

154
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:06,270
I think the idea about standup as
though you're going to try to be as self

155
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,090
indulgent,
like only you,

156
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,790
you try to be as little
self indulgence possible.

157
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:14,970
I'm that's the wrong way of phrasing
that does the least amount of self

158
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:17,910
indulgent humanly possible and the most
amount of entertainment for the people

159
00:09:17,911 --> 00:09:20,790
that are listening to the most
amount of self deprecation,

160
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:24,150
the most amount of laughs
that you can get out of it.

161
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,360
The most amount of humility and approach
to the lab so you don't make people

162
00:09:27,361 --> 00:09:28,051
uncomfortable.

163
00:09:28,051 --> 00:09:32,460
Like there's all these
variables in achieving the
laugh and achieving the laugh

164
00:09:32,461 --> 00:09:36,840
is like the proof that you're on the
same level and then they appreciate your

165
00:09:36,841 --> 00:09:39,870
sincerity and then you're,
you're funny and you're hilarious.

166
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:42,480
That's all working together.
So it's all like this,

167
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:44,460
like dance that you're
doing to achieve a result,

168
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:49,110
whereas you don't have to have a real
result with one of these fucking things.

169
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,390
You know what I mean? Would
have, you would think,

170
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:59,130
but the amount that aren't like to
get it to that polished diamond state

171
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:03,050
requires a lot of disciplines. But how
am I saying about stand up, stand up.

172
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:07,710
You eat dick on stage. It just
balances it out. You can't,

173
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,030
it's just too hard. The bombing
was too hard on the soul. You'll,

174
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:15,710
you'll come around to writing
the best shit you can. That's it.

175
00:10:15,711 --> 00:10:19,800
Did I really think there's a level of
bravery and stand up that is not really

176
00:10:19,801 --> 00:10:20,611
involved in music.

177
00:10:20,611 --> 00:10:25,500
People just don't judge you the same
way you know thing to quantify because I

178
00:10:25,501 --> 00:10:27,960
think there's a level of
bravery and being a soldier,

179
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,080
that's a lot tougher than the lower there,

180
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:33,000
but none of those people are here deeper
and deeper though. You know what I mean?

181
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:38,100
There's your referral of bravery
when Krogers save the earth either.

182
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,140
You're right.
I mean just always going to be,

183
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:43,220
everybody makes their effort
in a different way, you know?

184
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:48,290
Definitely the physical structure
to be a soldier and the brain power,

185
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:53,250
emotional power. Do you think you'd
go over and kick some ass for America?

186
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,190
I think,
I think I could

187
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:03,030
save myself not to Cincinnati.

188
00:11:03,031 --> 00:11:07,710
I'm not wearing parts of Ohio
national guard.

189
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:11,910
All of America since
Cincinnati and Cleveland.

190
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,410
Did they have a rivalry at all?

191
00:11:13,411 --> 00:11:16,680
Like if you said gas for Cleveland does
people in Cincinnati or they're going to

192
00:11:16,681 --> 00:11:18,010
hate on you now and
next time you're there,

193
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:26,590
it's really Kentucky versus Bangles
browns versus Steelers Brown's versus

194
00:11:27,361 --> 00:11:32,270
ravens. Those are the, that's the
Trifecta of difficult times in,

195
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,460
in that region of the country.
But I'll be honest with you,

196
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:37,440
I love playing in Pittsburgh.

197
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,470
I love playing in Cincinnati
and every time I'll have fun,

198
00:11:40,471 --> 00:11:43,140
harmless banter about our sports teams.

199
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:48,540
We say the same about Baltimore as
much as like Baltimore is a great town,

200
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:52,080
but we only really went through there
once and we literally stopped to eat

201
00:11:52,081 --> 00:11:53,680
dinner and found crack on the ground.

202
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:57,490
We've got to build belts.
I know,

203
00:11:57,491 --> 00:12:02,200
but we want to come play there and
get help us have to take some time.

204
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:03,160
Don't be a hero.

205
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:07,810
We're talking about the amount of
bravery it takes to be a comedian.

206
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:12,400
Pretty radically. Baltimore.
I had this guy, Michael Wood,

207
00:12:12,401 --> 00:12:15,040
who was a cop from Baltimore,
had him on the podcast. Oh Wow.

208
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:18,460
He was a retired cop and a young guy too,
you know,

209
00:12:18,461 --> 00:12:21,460
just a massive shoulder injuries.
Shoulder blew apart.

210
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,950
They put it back together and and
blue a party and he had to retire,

211
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:27,250
but very intelligent,

212
00:12:27,251 --> 00:12:31,780
articulate dude and very compassionate
and outside of the police department now

213
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:34,720
you know, still a young guy. What was
he like 35 or something like that?

214
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:40,630
Maybe younger. Did he get shot?
I forget what the injury was,

215
00:12:40,631 --> 00:12:43,340
but he had to get shoulder
reconstructive surgery and then it still,

216
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,760
it still didn't take and it
was like a shoulder's fucked.

217
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,090
Like he apparently was in a high speed
chase and shoulder just blew out,

218
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,730
was turning the steering wheel.
It's pretty, it's pretty fucked up.

219
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:56,710
But point is like he was talking about
how crazy Baltimore has always been.

220
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:59,680
If they found some directives,

221
00:12:59,681 --> 00:13:04,150
I guess it was from the police
department from the 1970s. And he's like,

222
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:07,060
me and these other cops are reading
this. We're like, Jesus fucking Christ,

223
00:13:07,061 --> 00:13:08,860
we're running,
we're chasing our tails.

224
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,610
Like this is exactly the same places
where the exact same crimes are going on.

225
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:14,380
There's a specific reason for that.

226
00:13:14,381 --> 00:13:16,470
And that's because there
was like literal like,

227
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:20,800
like constitutional or
like city ordinances of,

228
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:22,180
of segregation and,

229
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:26,260
and consolidating these neighborhoods
and having them be specifically black and

230
00:13:26,261 --> 00:13:29,080
you couldn't buy a house in a certain
neighborhood if you were black,

231
00:13:29,081 --> 00:13:31,660
even if you had the money, you
know, it's, it's the whole,

232
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:35,620
it's the whole tier is like,
they were just built to fail.

233
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:40,570
And the reason that crime was flourishing
and thriving so much is because they

234
00:13:40,571 --> 00:13:44,320
didn't have a fucking chance.
I mean, it's like the, uh,

235
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:49,210
I listened to NPR podcasts a little
while ago that explained how,

236
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:51,550
um,
when w was it,

237
00:13:51,551 --> 00:13:55,740
the 60s boom is post war post
World War Two, post World War II,

238
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,780
these housing ordinances for the vets
and things like that. And they're like,

239
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:03,400
hey guys, welcome back. You can't live
here. It's pretty brutal. It's awful.

240
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,293
It is pretty awful.

241
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:08,530
I didn't even know about that until
a few years ago and it seems like,

242
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,300
who do you remember who brought that up?

243
00:14:10,301 --> 00:14:14,200
Someone brought that up on the podcast
and we like what we had to look into it.

244
00:14:14,201 --> 00:14:17,920
Do you remember who it was, Jim? No,
it's the same with education too.

245
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:21,520
I mean it would be like
all of these, um, you know,

246
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:26,140
schools that just wouldn't let
intelligent African-american's in and you

247
00:14:26,141 --> 00:14:29,830
wouldn't get the education that you
wanted or deserved or know could achieve.

248
00:14:29,831 --> 00:14:32,500
And it was just like, you know,
you're kind of stuck in this box,

249
00:14:32,501 --> 00:14:35,680
which is those neighborhoods, you know,
they were, they were made for that.

250
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:40,000
It's total, it's so fucked up. There's
so many levels to the whole thing.

251
00:14:40,001 --> 00:14:43,510
Like first of all,
the level of overcoming slavery.

252
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:46,360
Like you ever heard a white guy
saying, God, it was so long ago,

253
00:14:46,361 --> 00:14:48,340
fucking get over it.
You know the Jews, I've,

254
00:14:48,341 --> 00:14:52,130
I've heard white guys say that
and you go, okay, it's not

255
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:56,670
that long. A hundred years before what
she was just talking about it. Yeah.

256
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:58,190
It seems like it was long.

257
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,690
Like I have a 1965 corvette
when that corvette,

258
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:06,980
when it was made a hundred years
before that almost exactly.

259
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:11,530
Slavery was abolished.
That's fucking crazy.

260
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:15,650
That's insane. Yeah. That might
be one of the most bizarre things.

261
00:15:15,651 --> 00:15:19,630
A hundred years is not my,
my wife's mom died recently.

262
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:23,000
She was 97 like she was
a hundred years old. Wow.

263
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:26,570
So from the time did she died too?
Like,

264
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:31,310
like realistically she could have been
alive while fucking slavery is happening.

265
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:35,810
Oh my God. Yeah. I mean it's real
listed. Like that amount of age.

266
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:39,280
You could have someone from 1965 and they,

267
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:44,030
if they were that age they could
remember fucking slavery. Yeah.

268
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:49,520
That's terrible. Oh God. God
Damn. That's like when I was born,

269
00:15:49,521 --> 00:15:52,280
I was born in 67 so I was
born two years after that.

270
00:15:52,281 --> 00:15:56,060
Like that is to me when I put it in
those terms, like the generational terms,

271
00:15:56,061 --> 00:15:56,550
it was yes.

272
00:15:56,550 --> 00:16:01,260
Today. Yeah. People had
slaves yesterday and all the,

273
00:16:01,261 --> 00:16:03,150
when they still do some places now.

274
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:06,030
I mean this is just start kind of like
this that's going on all we were just

275
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:08,810
talking about nail salons,
something that we found out, it's,

276
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:10,770
it's really disturbing
is that, um, you know,

277
00:16:10,771 --> 00:16:15,030
there's like a diamond dozen nail salons
in New York City or places like la

278
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:19,530
where it's really cheap to get your toes
and your fucking years painted and it

279
00:16:19,531 --> 00:16:22,620
was really good. But there's, there's
all, there's this like there's a,

280
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:28,740
wow, you're so, um, he would go
and he was put together by the way.

281
00:16:28,741 --> 00:16:32,390
You are missing a button and I can
see your belly button. Whoa. Hey,

282
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:35,490
I want to have a problem with that. And
again, I don't have a problem yet. No,

283
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:40,170
but they were these nail salons,
they bring in men and women,

284
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:42,240
um, from, you know, Thailand,

285
00:16:42,241 --> 00:16:45,750
Vietnam and they're like indentured
servants and then make them work and they

286
00:16:45,751 --> 00:16:48,450
don't pay them. And they, they
live in these apartments with,

287
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:53,390
with like 15 people sleeping in one room
and like, it's all going to Shit Misha.

288
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:57,150
Hmm. Yeah. How do they fix
that? It's a real good question.

289
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:01,140
I think in this like what
you can control for sure.

290
00:17:01,141 --> 00:17:05,050
First is in this country, you know,
I mean things like, uh, what I,

291
00:17:05,051 --> 00:17:08,130
we talked about before the show about
my friend Justin wren and all these,

292
00:17:08,131 --> 00:17:11,340
a little artifacts he brought back
back from the Congo like that guys like

293
00:17:11,341 --> 00:17:13,410
changing things in like real time.

294
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:18,900
But like in this country I think there's
a bunch of things that could be done

295
00:17:18,901 --> 00:17:20,550
that are just not done.
Sure.

296
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:24,780
One of the major ones is they have
to treat really poor neighborhoods.

297
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:28,800
Not like a static reality that had,
it just is what it is,

298
00:17:28,801 --> 00:17:31,650
is a really poor neighborhood.
They have to put it like as a problem,

299
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:34,660
like a wildfire. Like here you got a
wildfire, what are you going to do?

300
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:37,140
You can just kind of let it burn
and just get out of the way.

301
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:40,110
Or are you going to put it out?
You get the, you have a problem,

302
00:17:40,111 --> 00:17:44,230
you have a let the electricity's down,
you have a, you know, whatever. Oh,

303
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,890
a watermain broke. You have a
PR, there's a problem. Yeah.

304
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:50,900
But those have such direct, you know,
maybe that's what's so difficult about,

305
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:54,030
it's like put the put water on a fire,
it's going to go out. This is like God,

306
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,890
the implications on that stuff.
It's so crazy.

307
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:00,600
I think they should admit
first and foremost that a
horrible crime has been done

308
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,320
in places like Baltimore when they,
you know what this is,

309
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:08,370
Michael would describe it
as institutionalized racism
and we talk about the

310
00:18:08,371 --> 00:18:11,580
zones where people live. It's
hard to argue against that. So,

311
00:18:11,581 --> 00:18:14,700
and then you have to feel,
then you have to think about like,

312
00:18:14,701 --> 00:18:18,390
what is the best way to uh,
help people out of this?

313
00:18:18,391 --> 00:18:20,640
What's the best way to engineer like a,

314
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:24,600
a more crime free,
safer,

315
00:18:24,601 --> 00:18:26,440
more educated and aware and the more,

316
00:18:26,441 --> 00:18:30,840
and the people have these people feel
like they belong as part of the rest of

317
00:18:30,841 --> 00:18:35,040
the city. Yeah. To do that without
its collection efforts. I mean, yeah,

318
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:37,520
it's, it's something like, it's really,

319
00:18:37,521 --> 00:18:40,040
I'm really glad we're talking about
this because I think like this,

320
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:44,120
this kind of thing like keeps me up at
night when I think about like, like fuck,

321
00:18:44,121 --> 00:18:47,040
what can, what can I do? What can we
do? You know, you write a poem about it.

322
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:51,080
We want to hear it. Listen
Motherfucker, I had a poem right now,

323
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,360
like I'm going to start,

324
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:02,330
wait, but things like Joe, like
your podcast are, are Balkan.

325
00:19:02,331 --> 00:19:05,330
Pat, you like your fucking dog.
I'm serious though. Like this,

326
00:19:05,331 --> 00:19:10,220
this kind of thing is part of that
collective effort is as giving people that

327
00:19:10,221 --> 00:19:12,140
first grain of thought of like,
Oh wow,

328
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:17,150
I never knew that there were zoning laws
in Baltimore and inner cities that made

329
00:19:17,151 --> 00:19:20,870
it really hard for black people to
get ahead in life that they had no

330
00:19:20,871 --> 00:19:24,650
scholarships. You know, Pete,
the changes that need to be,

331
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,800
that need to take place.
Like we don't have some kind of solution,

332
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,330
you know like this think tank.

333
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:33,270
But you have this platform where
you can start talking about it and,

334
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:38,110
and informing people. And you know,
when I, when I get really worked up and,

335
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:41,000
and, and think about like,
what can we do? You know,

336
00:19:41,001 --> 00:19:44,870
we have this band that is growing
and getting attention and you know,

337
00:19:44,871 --> 00:19:48,080
you have these opportunities to sit
here and talk to somebody like you and

338
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,540
people are listening and you know,

339
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:55,750
you hope that that starts more another
train of thought that can actually make

340
00:19:56,091 --> 00:19:58,190
some kind of different,
I don't know what it is.

341
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,940
I think people are already
having these conversations.

342
00:20:00,941 --> 00:20:04,720
And one of the things that they love
about podcasts like this is because,

343
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:08,620
you know, you go, yes, other people were
thinking like this too. Like people are,

344
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:09,940
people are wondering,

345
00:20:09,941 --> 00:20:14,500
how did we get to be grown adults with
this chaotic system in place that was

346
00:20:14,501 --> 00:20:16,600
established by people who,
you know,

347
00:20:16,601 --> 00:20:20,800
when you go back to the origins of
civilization, even just in this country,

348
00:20:20,801 --> 00:20:24,550
which is at like a really recent country,
those people are monsters.

349
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:29,590
Those people
are monsters.

350
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,460
Oh man,
the fucking hammer lumbers had done.

351
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:36,480
Oh my God,
we're monsters.

352
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:42,880
Like, and this isn't, yeah, that's fucked
up. I just read this book about, um,

353
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:43,900
the first,
uh,

354
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:48,190
like the first interactions between
the West or mainly or in Europe

355
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:49,300
and Japan.
You know,

356
00:20:49,301 --> 00:20:52,420
when the journeys that these people
would have to go through to trade to make

357
00:20:52,421 --> 00:20:53,380
contact with these countries.

358
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:57,550
And I mean it's the way they looked at
the world then was the way we look at the

359
00:20:57,551 --> 00:20:59,950
universe now it's just like,
I don't know what's over there.

360
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:02,380
I have no idea what's going on.
There's things Johnny,

361
00:21:02,381 --> 00:21:06,790
there's icebergs jutting out of the water
and monsters that eat people like in

362
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:10,210
cannibals and shit. Like that was real,
you know, so it's like this super,

363
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:15,420
I think climate of defensiveness
that we all add just as a person,

364
00:21:16,121 --> 00:21:19,750
you grow up kind of trying to defend
yourself against the environment,

365
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,290
high level. And then Mac Nellie's
takes off, sorry, go ahead.

366
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:26,710
There's just a layer of danger that
at least where we are, you know,

367
00:21:26,711 --> 00:21:29,530
accustomed to. So you're going around
the world being like, holy fuck.

368
00:21:29,531 --> 00:21:34,230
Like where am I? I don't want to get
killed. 50% of my man just died. You like,

369
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,501
you know it's,
I don't know.

370
00:21:35,501 --> 00:21:38,740
I don't know what I'm trying to say
other than the context is so different.

371
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:39,603
You know it's,
it's

372
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:43,620
totally different world.
That's why it's insane to live our,

373
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:47,910
to have our civilization run the way
it's run now just because it's been done,

374
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:50,940
done this way for a hundred
plus 200 plus whatever years.

375
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:52,830
Like if we wanted to start out today,

376
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:55,140
how many people would think would
accept the electoral college?

377
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:58,230
How many people would accept the
idea that you actually just elect a

378
00:21:58,231 --> 00:22:03,060
representative and that representative
can actually like he can choose to vote

379
00:22:03,061 --> 00:22:05,340
against the wishes of the rest
of the state. Like you can,

380
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:10,500
you have like a electoral
college and then you have a win.

381
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:14,230
Each state has a certain amount of
points that go in and you watch the,

382
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:18,270
when you watched a v like that, like how
many votes is what and what's going on,

383
00:22:18,271 --> 00:22:20,940
the numbers are in and what
the fuck are you talking about?

384
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,320
And then you find out that like,

385
00:22:22,321 --> 00:22:25,260
especially during like the George Bush
days and they were still doing it with a

386
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:27,720
piece of paper with a whole,
and that piece of paper

387
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:31,290
that was,
when was in that,

388
00:22:31,291 --> 00:22:36,291
like the 90s when the election
was recalled because it was,

389
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,193
there was,
they

390
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:41,590
count well to this day people
still believe Al Gore won. Yeah.

391
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:44,290
There's a lot of people that believe
he won and that they fucked him out of

392
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:44,651
Florida.

393
00:22:44,651 --> 00:22:49,651
And it was also like how would we did
some weird shit where they like they just

394
00:22:49,711 --> 00:22:53,650
crossed people's names out and ban them
if they thought they were black and then

395
00:22:53,651 --> 00:22:57,850
they would have to prove that they
weren't the person that that was a off the

396
00:22:57,870 --> 00:23:02,380
this list of like Fallons or you know
like sometimes people, Jimmy White,

397
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:04,770
there's a lot of fucking Jimmy
wide span. You know, if you're,

398
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:08,470
if you're Jimmy White and you live in
Baltimore and there's a thousand of the

399
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,480
Jimmy Whites and 20 of
them had been to jail,

400
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:13,480
like good luck getting registered to vote,

401
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:14,770
they're going to put
you on a fucking list.

402
00:23:14,771 --> 00:23:19,771
And then you have to go to court to
like make sure that you can vote.

403
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:22,450
It takes too much time. They're not
going to do it. No one's going to do it.

404
00:23:22,451 --> 00:23:25,270
Then all of the time for that and
they know that they rigged it,

405
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:29,620
which is just dark. Here's the
thing, it's like an American,

406
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:34,600
this system is flawed. I mean there's
just no fucking two ways around it.

407
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,090
I just don't think it
needs to be here anymore.

408
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:41,800
I think it's like one of those things
like you need to write books on paper with

409
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,460
ink.

410
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:46,930
You need a quill and you just shit a no,

411
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:49,820
you don't need a sieve. I Candela. You
don't need to write with a feather.

412
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:55,030
You can talk and your computer will
dictate it were brand new world and this

413
00:23:55,761 --> 00:24:00,140
world of, it's hard to get
information across to the states,

414
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:02,990
so you need a representative.
He need, you can't eat that.

415
00:24:02,991 --> 00:24:06,200
You want to make sure that every area,
even the high population areas,

416
00:24:06,201 --> 00:24:08,510
they don't dominate the rural farm lands.

417
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,420
So we need to have some sort of system
where people give a fuck about Iowa.

418
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:16,100
I mean, that's really what it is. But
that's that. That's the only place,

419
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:19,670
because it was all established
when people were apes,

420
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:23,120
but we were raft riding
a bus with no cars. Yeah.

421
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:26,450
They didn't have phones that didn't know
where the fuck you went when you went

422
00:24:26,451 --> 00:24:29,840
out of sight. If you went into the
woods, if they thought you were a dream.

423
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,030
People didn't even know if
they ever really did know.

424
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:35,690
They fucking really knew for
sure that you were coming back.

425
00:24:35,691 --> 00:24:40,670
They make a painting of you
think about that.

426
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,513
Yeah.

427
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:43,390
Thanks.
That was it.

428
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:48,350
I remember the guy from the
writing shit that's cool.

429
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,700
On the cave was like an eight.

430
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:52,310
It was like an eight track
[inaudible] we were just in old town.

431
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:55,610
We were just an old town San
Diego yesterday after we played.

432
00:24:55,611 --> 00:24:58,290
We played in San Diego yesterday
afternoon. And you go, God, I love it.

433
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:03,040
Sounds pretty pretty. You know, it's
pretty charming. But they had like, I,

434
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:05,630
you know what, I was so hungry and
I was like walking by in passing,

435
00:25:05,631 --> 00:25:10,370
but they had like costumes,
um, like San Diego, San Diego,

436
00:25:10,371 --> 00:25:11,660
like settlers,
you know.

437
00:25:11,661 --> 00:25:16,661
But they like looked like pirates and
they were walking in the streets and um,

438
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:21,440
people were freaking out. They were
like, well, maybe there was a bus.

439
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:26,450
There were like two big buses of tourists.
I'm going crazy.

440
00:25:26,451 --> 00:25:31,010
Like I was, I was like, I was like, God
dammit. Everybody calmed down. Jesus,

441
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,190
it's just a guy with a Cape
on fucking slow your roll.

442
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:38,540
But it was, um, it was funny. Well,

443
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:42,680
just kind of piggybacking and what we're
talking about because I'm thoroughly

444
00:25:42,681 --> 00:25:46,680
obsessed with, um, like frontier
shows like deadwood. Oh,

445
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,770
and I'm watching hell on wheels right now.

446
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:54,350
I just got into this show how on wheels?
It's on AMC and it's,

447
00:25:54,351 --> 00:25:57,230
it's really, it's really well
written. I'm only in like season two,

448
00:25:57,231 --> 00:25:59,090
so I don't know what happened
after this guy's like,

449
00:25:59,091 --> 00:26:02,090
I don't know if this is like blow the
forest statement, but it's still going.

450
00:26:02,091 --> 00:26:05,300
So that says something bad about,
it's, it's about, um, this,

451
00:26:05,301 --> 00:26:09,440
this railroad that's being
built. Uh, the, and like, it's,

452
00:26:09,441 --> 00:26:14,330
it's incredible to be privy to
that that day and age where like,

453
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:16,640
it's so wild.
It's so lawless.

454
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:20,240
Everybody is just like barely
staying alive. You're like,

455
00:26:20,241 --> 00:26:23,360
Indians are coming in killing you
and slaughtering you. You know,

456
00:26:23,361 --> 00:26:26,480
you're like taking over their shit.
And it's really,

457
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:30,020
for some reason it just cuts
right to my soul. Like I can't,

458
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:35,320
I can't not be just totally enamored and
you know, enthralled by it and it like,

459
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:39,720
it's, it's interesting to
think about because that also
wasn't that long ago. No,

460
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:40,401
the,
the,

461
00:26:40,401 --> 00:26:45,401
the frontier days when the country
focus solely on this one thing together,

462
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:47,520
you know,
building this country,

463
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:50,580
well maybe not together because there's
so many immigrants in so many people

464
00:26:50,581 --> 00:26:54,510
that were like isolated and,
but the point is that like,

465
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,710
it's interesting to witness everyone
fighting their battle, you know? But the,

466
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:03,660
there's these great parts of the show
when they all have to come together for a

467
00:27:03,661 --> 00:27:04,494
common purpose.

468
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,950
Like there's robbers robbing the train
that gets them their pay and if they

469
00:27:07,951 --> 00:27:09,900
don't get their pay,
they're broke. You know?

470
00:27:09,901 --> 00:27:14,901
So there's like this
interesting camaraderie and
then their enemies and then you

471
00:27:14,941 --> 00:27:18,270
know, and that's kind of how it is
in real life, you know, which is,

472
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:22,590
which is interesting to
think about because we're
all so different and you know

473
00:27:22,591 --> 00:27:23,850
when you have these efforts,

474
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:27,090
and I don't want to say common enemy
because that sounds really negative,

475
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,840
but like when you're all working
towards something with your differences,

476
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,510
that's when actual
progress starts being made.

477
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:36,600
Right. That's, that's always a good
scene in the movie, right? Yeah.

478
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:40,920
To get seen as she can with the neighbors
to fight the monsters. Mel Gibson. Yeah.

479
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:41,823
How long

480
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,960
exactly what watching
Terminator Terminator two.

481
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:52,020
Isn't that really why we get so angry
and offended when people whine and bitch

482
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:56,410
today? Because like you're
like, good fucking Lord.

483
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:01,150
You live in the best time ever.
Society's going to shit. No,

484
00:28:01,151 --> 00:28:03,940
it's good to be humble role.
It's fucking falling apart. Okay.

485
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:08,680
Nunez and he values anymore.
No one values culture or art.

486
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:13,090
Will you please stop saying that
everyone then we're just dealing with

487
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:17,440
overwhelming numbers of people
yelling in a room. That's what it is.

488
00:28:17,441 --> 00:28:22,441
It's not that there's not as much or
way more interesting shit in that noise.

489
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:27,260
It's just there's so many fucking
people communicating now. Crazy. Yeah.

490
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:30,170
It's the whole rule. The, the, the,

491
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,850
the whole game is a different thing.
Everyone talks now. Yeah. Yeah.

492
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,090
Well,
you know what's,

493
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:39,440
you know what's super cool is like getting
people outside of their comfort zone

494
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:43,490
and watching how they deal with
it in like a, a way that like,

495
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:48,560
so like my folks live in Ohio,
pretty Republican,

496
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:52,010
you know, but they're really good people
on there. They're fucking hilarious.

497
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:55,470
And they came out to five shows in
Colorado on this last tour that we had

498
00:28:55,590 --> 00:29:00,360
constant. It was, oh my God,
it was so Joe, it was talking
so close to smoking weed.

499
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:04,280
Yeah. My Dad, my dad just retired.
Just, it was just like a slow,

500
00:29:04,281 --> 00:29:07,430
a ginger backing out was there
to help. It was, so my dad,

501
00:29:07,431 --> 00:29:10,550
my dad's got a super thick Cleveland
acts and he's like, if I'm going to,

502
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:14,210
if I'm going to smoke pot with my daughter
and it's legal, I'm going to do it.

503
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:16,790
And it's just like, what did, I didn't
do it right. And I was like, well,

504
00:29:16,791 --> 00:29:19,810
it ain't no weed. I mean, I was
like, right, you look great.

505
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,310
You gotta take it slow now
what you're getting into,

506
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:25,130
but I'll make sure it got like,
that doesn't drown,

507
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:29,330
but I want to tell you this fucking cool
thing. Which was that like, you know,

508
00:29:29,331 --> 00:29:31,070
I love my parents so much and they're,

509
00:29:31,071 --> 00:29:33,830
they're really incredible people and
I've watched them grow in this way that

510
00:29:33,831 --> 00:29:36,040
like they're always changing.
And there they,

511
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:38,670
even though they have like
their beliefs and my dad is,

512
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:43,630
has worked his fucking ass off his life,
you know, and he, he's, uh, you know,

513
00:29:43,631 --> 00:29:46,210
middleclass business owner just
retired. So he's got this, you know,

514
00:29:46,211 --> 00:29:50,440
this view on life. And then we,
we put them in Colorado and he,

515
00:29:50,441 --> 00:29:54,690
they caravan for five shows in this.
We had, we had lunch with this, um,

516
00:29:55,510 --> 00:30:00,460
with these incredible people,
this, uh, this judge, this lawyer,

517
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:05,550
and he's like, you know, kind
of liberal Hippie, um, you know,

518
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,740
politicians in Colorado. And we, oh,

519
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:09,520
we were sitting at a table
with my parents and I was just,

520
00:30:09,521 --> 00:30:13,120
it was so cool to watch them interact
with people that they would never hang out

521
00:30:13,121 --> 00:30:17,170
with and, and then watch them sort
of like lay back and have like,

522
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:21,220
just like absorb this information
that's not something that they wouldn't,

523
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:24,850
they would have on a regular basis.
And so they, they left. And it was,

524
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:26,230
it was such an interesting,

525
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:30,910
like I really felt our relationship
changed a little bit after that, you know,

526
00:30:30,911 --> 00:30:33,460
and just watching them let lose my
dad really wanted to smoke weed,

527
00:30:33,461 --> 00:30:34,840
but it just never worked out.

528
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:38,260
He did what he had to drive and that
was responsible cause he would have been

529
00:30:38,261 --> 00:30:39,820
fucked up.
Do you think like

530
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:42,890
gotten more successful and
as you've gotten older,

531
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:45,590
your dad can look at you
not just as his daughter,

532
00:30:45,591 --> 00:30:49,700
but also as an adult human being
where he respects your opinion?

533
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:54,110
Oh yeah. Yeah. No, we're, we're,
we're very, um, we are like, no,

534
00:30:54,111 --> 00:30:55,970
we have a really incredible relationship.

535
00:30:56,210 --> 00:31:00,610
What did she say?
I said so,

536
00:31:00,611 --> 00:31:03,800
so we're not there yet.
Well,

537
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:09,860
a meal ticket. No, I would love to take
care of nothing wrong with that. Yeah.

538
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,510
Beautiful. But, but I mean,

539
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:16,810
you're a woman now and you're
like a professional singer
of a like of the utmost

540
00:31:19,071 --> 00:31:22,310
respect. Lay people live. Love
Your Shit. So it's like you, she,

541
00:31:22,311 --> 00:31:24,560
he goes to see you and he sees her.

542
00:31:24,561 --> 00:31:29,561
He sees his daughter on stage wailing
out these songs and people going nuts.

543
00:31:29,601 --> 00:31:31,610
You don't think that must
make him think like, Whoa,

544
00:31:31,611 --> 00:31:36,140
I gotta I gotta appreciate
like what it took to do that.

545
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:39,980
I have to appreciate what's happening
here. Like this isn't just my daughter.

546
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:43,190
She doesn't just have to listen to me.
She's not like,

547
00:31:43,191 --> 00:31:44,300
I'm not right about everything.

548
00:31:44,301 --> 00:31:46,130
I can't be right about
everything cause I can't do that.

549
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:50,550
No, we, he's both my mom
and my dad are really, uh,

550
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:54,840
they,
their support like is,

551
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:59,010
is beyond anything I ever could
have wanted. I mean they, they, uh,

552
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:03,710
I moved to New York City when I
was 16 because, um, I used to be a,

553
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:08,460
I was a catalog model and I was doing
really well and my parents were like,

554
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,890
I was starting my junior year
of high school and they were,

555
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:14,820
I was really fucking driven.
Like I had no inhibitions and I was like,

556
00:32:14,821 --> 00:32:17,820
I want to go here and I want to go here
and do you guys think I can do that?

557
00:32:17,821 --> 00:32:22,390
And they were like, yeah. And they, and
they let me move there when I was 16. Wow.

558
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:25,740
And it was fucking crazy.
And it honestly was one of those,

559
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:29,280
I think kind of pivotal moments where it,

560
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:34,330
it was their belief in the fact that
I could do what I wanted cause they,

561
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:37,410
they were like, I think you have
something special, you know,

562
00:32:37,411 --> 00:32:40,220
which is like a really
incredible feeling to have.

563
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,550
And they were always behind
me and like, yeah, we fight.

564
00:32:43,551 --> 00:32:47,480
I mean my family is really close so we
fight hard. There's a lot of yelling.

565
00:32:47,481 --> 00:32:49,160
I grew up with a lot of yelling,
but

566
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:54,580
I know,
I know a lot of fucking memory lane.

567
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:57,480
Yeah.
Oh my God.

568
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:03,060
This is going to happen at some point.
We'll talk all about you got a baby.

569
00:33:03,061 --> 00:33:03,894
Fuck him.

570
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:08,140
Hello baby steps.

571
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:12,000
Can we find another baby steps,

572
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:16,230
baby steps, another word in there.
You know what I'm saying though?

573
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:20,760
He across like even though it was,
it sounds like an inappropriate statement,

574
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:22,230
but you know what I'm saying,

575
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:29,660
the innocence
like see,

576
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:31,620
you know these

577
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:36,760
ray was, had, had to think
quite ludes in the 70s.

578
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:40,090
Well that's a problem too,
right? You start thinking like,

579
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,570
I want to be that loser again.

580
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,900
You know, down a tunnel. I'm sure
you also realize, hey, this does not,

581
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:50,470
this isn't go with success.
This doesn't help me, uh,

582
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:55,600
get my shit together and not be
psychologically terrified most of the day

583
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:03,220
looking around for my next fix of
Qualia foods. They were human though.

584
00:34:03,221 --> 00:34:07,310
Like my mind's smoke weed. My Dad
used to smoke weed and like, Yo,

585
00:34:07,311 --> 00:34:08,770
we're going to Ben,
we're going to do this.

586
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:15,420
I think there's a bad idea or
it might be amazing. I mean,

587
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:16,500
my dad's 94

588
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:19,760
four oh nine perfect.
What are you holding back cancer?

589
00:34:19,761 --> 00:34:24,460
What are you worried about
that? Well, my 94 is convince.

590
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:28,790
Convincing man, maybe you're
right. 94 is the home stretch.

591
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,130
He might freak the fuck
out. No, but he might not.

592
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:35,870
He might like ease slowly into the great
beyond two or three year old man to go

593
00:34:35,871 --> 00:34:37,520
from a pot to mushrooms.

594
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:42,740
They say that mushroom six is significant
reliever of the stress of worrying

595
00:34:42,741 --> 00:34:46,170
about the expectation.
I'm so glad you just said it.

596
00:34:46,171 --> 00:34:48,980
I've never even thought about with
him, you know? But he has anxiety.

597
00:34:48,981 --> 00:34:51,430
He's freaked out. He's been
staring at the void dude for real.

598
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:53,120
He's seen his body deteriorate.

599
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:56,330
All these things happening and
I get the anxiety from them.

600
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,310
It's a real issue with
people, man. You know,

601
00:34:58,311 --> 00:35:02,630
when we were kids and we would see what
we would call and quotes the angry old

602
00:35:02,631 --> 00:35:07,580
man, you know, fucking kids.
And we always thought like,

603
00:35:07,581 --> 00:35:11,880
God, it's got such a downer. Everybody
has them. Every neighborhood has a guide.

604
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:15,200
Poisoned the cats evil motherfucker.
Yeah.

605
00:35:15,201 --> 00:35:19,760
He put a rat poison and killed a
bunch of cows. Forgot his name.

606
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:23,930
He's long gone though. Of
course. Of course. Yeah.

607
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:28,270
Every neighborhood has like old people
that are angry and one of the things that

608
00:35:28,271 --> 00:35:29,061
they're angry at,

609
00:35:29,061 --> 00:35:34,061
it's like the vitality of their vessel
is eroding before their eyes and you just

610
00:35:36,471 --> 00:35:37,860
get caught up in this shit.
And

611
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:42,350
that's when you meet old people that
hate young people. Yeah. You know,

612
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:46,170
that was Elizabeth Bathory, I think it
was. Is that what her name? I don't know.

613
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:49,920
One of the most evil women
of all time. She was a, a,

614
00:35:49,921 --> 00:35:54,890
a royal all imports is in New Orleans.
There was a crazy long time ago.

615
00:35:54,891 --> 00:35:56,610
It was, no, it was in, it was in like,

616
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:01,460
I want to say Hungary is Beth.
Um,

617
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:04,640
but she's like one of the most famous
serial killers of all time. Oh Shit.

618
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:08,400
And what she started doing
after she started getting older,

619
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:13,670
she started killing all these young women
that were in the town and she would,

620
00:36:14,161 --> 00:36:17,830
uh, she would like bathe and
their blood and she would,

621
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:22,020
she would torture them. Yeah. It
was in the 1500 hundreds in Hungary.

622
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:26,820
1516 Elizabeth Bathory.
Oh.

623
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:31,830
And she apparently is like attractive
when she was younger and then as she got

624
00:36:31,831 --> 00:36:36,060
older, her appearance
fading beauty, snow, White,

625
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,270
Kinda [inaudible] away. I mean, it's just,

626
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:42,180
it's a scary fucking story because
she was a royal, she was a,

627
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,790
a very wealthy royal person,
so she never,

628
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:50,010
her punishment was just stay in your
castle. Yeah, she killed a lot of people.

629
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:53,760
Might've been like hundreds of
women or something. Oh yeah,

630
00:36:53,761 --> 00:36:57,420
it was hundreds and they just, they just
made her stay in her castle. That was it.

631
00:36:57,421 --> 00:36:58,590
That was the punishment.
I think the,

632
00:36:58,610 --> 00:37:02,190
she like a special room that she had
to stay in and our castle, I mean,

633
00:37:02,191 --> 00:37:06,570
so hot kind of jail I guess. But
I mean, she still had her money.

634
00:37:06,571 --> 00:37:10,950
She still had servants.
That's kind of how it is now.

635
00:37:10,951 --> 00:37:12,690
Just in a very different way.

636
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:17,720
Like people that are on top can get away
with so much like this fucking heavy.

637
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:22,470
Have you seen the Robert Durst
stuff on Hbo? I haven't seen it,

638
00:37:22,471 --> 00:37:27,180
but I know about it. Gotten
pretty far. One would say,

639
00:37:27,181 --> 00:37:30,660
and now he's kind of fucked himself
and it's looking like hopefully fingers

640
00:37:30,661 --> 00:37:34,830
crossed. Um, you know, he'll, he's
going to go to jail. He's in jail.

641
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:39,490
He should be dead
pretty soon.

642
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,320
So apparently I was incorrect.
She, at the end of her life,

643
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:47,430
they put her in solitary confinement,
so she wasn't a castle,

644
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:50,370
but she was placed in solitary.
She kept,

645
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,990
she was kept bricked into a set
of rooms with only small slits up,

646
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:57,260
left open for ventilation
and the passing of foods.

647
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:02,100
She remained there for four years until
her death. So she was psychotic anyway.

648
00:38:02,101 --> 00:38:04,170
And then they trapped.
She was a voter in like a black room.

649
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:08,940
She was a rich monster, which she was.
She was a privileged, rich monster.

650
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:12,540
And at the end she was such a monster
when they found what she had done,

651
00:38:12,541 --> 00:38:15,240
that they found the bones
of these hundreds of women
and they knew that she had

652
00:38:15,241 --> 00:38:16,290
been doing it forever.

653
00:38:16,291 --> 00:38:19,590
And the servants knew when she bring
girls in and they would be screaming and

654
00:38:19,591 --> 00:38:22,350
she would cut them up in front
of everybody and tie him up and,

655
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:26,550
and like feel tubs with their blood
and the throw their bodies aside.

656
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,430
And she had it.
She did it for a long fucking

657
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:35,680
famous woman in New Orleans is a house
you can go to. And she was just, you know,

658
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:35,990
member.

659
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:38,350
There's Times in American horror story,
I don't know,

660
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:40,270
but it's just like a famous story

661
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:47,530
you want to go either. No, I
don't. Not Interested in that.

662
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,850
It's just so scary.

663
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:53,870
It's so scary where people can get
to a fan of a position of ultimate

664
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:58,690
[inaudible]. They have a slave, they
have a, you know, if they have a royalty,

665
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:03,070
like if you've seen what's going on in
Los Angeles with all these guys from the

666
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:04,820
Middle East that keep doing
crazy things and they're,

667
00:39:04,821 --> 00:39:07,240
they're getting arrested and they're
claiming diplomatic immunity.

668
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:09,970
Like that was the weapon bringing
it back to the lethal weapon. Sorry.

669
00:39:09,971 --> 00:39:13,540
But that was like a big part of that
movie was that Diplomatic Immune African

670
00:39:13,541 --> 00:39:16,850
guy. Oh yeah. Yeah. That's really
neat. I didn't even see say

671
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:23,770
11. It was from other movie has
been a bunch of them lately.

672
00:39:23,771 --> 00:39:25,440
One guy was uh,
the uh,

673
00:39:25,441 --> 00:39:29,490
the two guys fled the country because they
were racing through Beverly hills. Oh,

674
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,350
I did hear when they tried to claim
diplomatic immunity and they just,

675
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:36,600
it's scarred up my new specs.
Qatari Kikuyu, a Tiara,

676
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:40,930
whatever the fuck that is one of
those strange pregnant, probably not,

677
00:39:40,931 --> 00:39:43,360
even if they hurt,
they don't even use the English language.

678
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:45,700
So like their letters are
different than our letters.

679
00:39:45,701 --> 00:39:50,300
So we write something like really awful
like QT a r I or something like that.

680
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:54,860
It's our fuck up.
They don't even use are like,

681
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,390
why do we make it so you know?

682
00:39:56,860 --> 00:40:01,060
Why does it have to be such a weird
fucking civilians? We got wrong.

683
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,760
Say it like what does it sound like?
Bitch was right it,

684
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:10,360
it's so hard. Tell me, tell
me what it sounds like.

685
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:13,210
You need some new letters?
We're fine.

686
00:40:13,211 --> 00:40:16,000
We're just got to stop talking
to people that use phlegm.

687
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:25,630
I don't know.
He's not listening to me

688
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:32,560
sort of rant. That was back when people
were actually terms. A lot of things,

689
00:40:32,561 --> 00:40:35,150
right? They had a lot of really
beautiful things with them.

690
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,320
They ate a lot of cheese.
It was a big part of the Diet.

691
00:40:38,321 --> 00:40:42,280
There's a lot of phlegm in the air.
Back then people were Super Fleming.

692
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:45,340
It goes back to what we were
talking about before. Human Voice.

693
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:48,660
I could do some crazy shit.
You can do some crazy shit with this.

694
00:40:48,661 --> 00:40:52,000
Have you seen there's a video of a girl
who can sing two pitches at the same

695
00:40:52,001 --> 00:40:55,750
time. It's fucked up. What? Yeah, and
she can move them in opposite direction.

696
00:40:55,751 --> 00:40:58,630
She can hold one, move another one.
Like she's just using her body.

697
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:01,000
I'll look it up. How is she? Well
Jamie will do it and pull it up.

698
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:04,570
Put Your headset on. There's
a word for it. He'll find it.

699
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:07,210
There's Tuvan throat singing in,

700
00:41:07,211 --> 00:41:09,850
in Mongolia where they're
activating all of these overtones.

701
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:13,720
Literally singing courts like shit,

702
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:17,900
none of us do like tunnels,
phonic overtone

703
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:23,470
singing,
but more than one.

704
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:27,460
I'm trying guys do my best.

705
00:41:27,461 --> 00:41:31,660
So do you think that this is something
that she was a born with this ability or

706
00:41:31,661 --> 00:41:34,070
all? We can all do it. We could do

707
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:35,750
it. We all have the equipment.
It's like perfect pitch.

708
00:41:35,751 --> 00:41:39,050
You know about what perfect pitches?
No. So it starts with pitches,

709
00:41:39,051 --> 00:41:42,980
the ability to just recognize
frequencies as per the musical alphabet.

710
00:41:42,981 --> 00:41:45,560
So if I went like this and B
flat, yeah, you would know,

711
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:49,520
oh that's a g because I know the sound
of that frequency and we are all born

712
00:41:49,521 --> 00:41:52,130
with this, but for the most
part it's not really useful.

713
00:41:52,131 --> 00:41:55,220
So we just kind of
phase it out. Right. Um,

714
00:41:55,490 --> 00:41:58,700
but some people develop it or for some
weird kind of developmental reason,

715
00:41:58,701 --> 00:42:02,660
they hold on to it. Um, and if you're
a musician, super can be super helpful.

716
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:07,190
But this chick, she's just doing what we
can all do, but she's just developed it.

717
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:08,053
Let's hear it.

718
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:09,480
Okay.

719
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,520
The lady and the cat.
Yes.

720
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:14,613
Just kind of a bad too.

721
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,220
Or

722
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:24,820
30

723
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:30,200
or,

724
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,330
oh,

725
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,940
[inaudible]

726
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:44,310
it goes on for minutes with, she'll just
eat control. She has this incredible,

727
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:46,740
oh my gosh. Has an English
accent. She was an obituary.

728
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:49,470
Not English in my mind is

729
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:53,323
perfect.

730
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,290
Oh Wow.

731
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:08,420
Okay.

732
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:10,910
So is this something that she developed?
Yeah.

733
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:18,020
Do you think can do it? Joe? I believe
in you. Believe in me. Interesting.

734
00:43:19,290 --> 00:43:23,630
Isn't it? Beautiful support takes
us so far. Yeah. I just, that's,

735
00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:28,010
that's insane. Yeah. Have you
heard Tuvan throat singing? No.

736
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:30,890
It's a Mongolian. Thanks. Super
Traditional. Here's the thing. No,

737
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:35,180
right now it's a novelty because that
doesn't sound as good as someone singing.

738
00:43:35,181 --> 00:43:39,860
Awesome. So it was kind
of silly. If I can,

739
00:43:39,861 --> 00:43:43,760
I can sort of agree that
was more like introductory.

740
00:43:43,761 --> 00:43:47,750
That would be like you like being
like this is how you sweep the knee.

741
00:43:47,751 --> 00:43:50,410
I don't really know the
terminology sweeped in Asia

742
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,670
our friendship is on a different level,

743
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:59,810
but at some point I really hope you
can teach me the martial arts ways.

744
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:04,160
Do you teach us can actually I was sure,
yeah. We'll show you guys some stuff.

745
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:09,250
I don't have the time to spend kind of
like really train you because he like lit.

746
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:09,651
No.

747
00:44:09,651 --> 00:44:13,220
This is why I'm gonna say this because
if you really want to learn martial arts,

748
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:17,000
martial arts is not something that you're
ever going to get good by dabbling.

749
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:17,421
Sure.

750
00:44:17,421 --> 00:44:20,660
You're going to have to get obsessed with
it and going to do it all the time and

751
00:44:20,661 --> 00:44:24,720
I don't have the time to teach
you all others do what I'm saying.

752
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:25,870
What I would is,

753
00:44:25,870 --> 00:44:30,580
what I would do is I would introduce
you guys to some movement and some nice,

754
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:34,590
great and I would show you what your
body's possible of if you understood where

755
00:44:34,591 --> 00:44:38,190
to put it in like simple stuff.
There's like simple stuff that you can do,

756
00:44:38,191 --> 00:44:39,420
especially Jujitsu.

757
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:43,680
Jujitsu is the like one of the easiest
ones for me to explain to someone because

758
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:46,890
then I can explain to you in a
way that I get my kids to do it.

759
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:50,370
Like my kids choke me all
the time trying to teach,

760
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:52,310
trying to teach my kids to them,

761
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:55,710
trying to teach my kids to
utilize their hips properly,

762
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:59,520
throw their weight and do a kick.
Like there's a snap your head.

763
00:45:00,790 --> 00:45:04,650
Yeah. It's amazing. I really way it
totally is and I had a death. I didn't.

764
00:45:04,651 --> 00:45:05,820
You give me the poem faith.

765
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:10,140
Well that isn't a way it's is it a way
in the same way that we were talking

766
00:45:10,141 --> 00:45:15,141
about pool is is it in a way or we'll
call it when it's nice when it's nice,

767
00:45:16,951 --> 00:45:20,330
when it's nice to look at like when
someone's dancing. It's nice to do that.

768
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:21,690
When I think about guitar,

769
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:26,250
that's a huge reason why I want to take
martial arts is because of how it would

770
00:45:26,251 --> 00:45:28,320
impact playing the guitar,
playing an instrument,

771
00:45:28,321 --> 00:45:31,140
doing anything because all
of a sudden your efficiency,

772
00:45:31,141 --> 00:45:34,840
your movement changes and you're
capable of different stuff. Yeah.

773
00:45:35,370 --> 00:45:37,850
I think everything is like that.
I think.

774
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:42,030
I think if you watch like a
little kid's gymnastics class, um,

775
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:47,060
I take my kids to gymnastics and I watched
his little kids bounce around and uh,

776
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:51,390
it's very interesting watching like
someone nail something, you know,

777
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:53,070
like there's these girls that are older,

778
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:57,660
probably like a 12 or 13 or something
along those lines. And they're like,

779
00:45:57,990 --> 00:46:00,450
just starting to figure
out how to do back flips.

780
00:46:00,451 --> 00:46:02,730
And they're just starting to
figure out how to land gracefully.

781
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:04,680
And then there's girls that
are even older than that,

782
00:46:04,681 --> 00:46:08,550
like maybe 16 and 17 that are just wicked
and you're watching them flip through

783
00:46:08,551 --> 00:46:10,800
the air and you're like cheesy as fuck.

784
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:16,350
And there's some young boys that do like
these crazy ring exercises where they

785
00:46:16,351 --> 00:46:19,500
can stretch,
the arms are straight and they're fucking,

786
00:46:19,501 --> 00:46:22,380
they bring their feet up above their
head and they flip over and they do a

787
00:46:22,381 --> 00:46:24,180
handstand. I mean, it's nuts, right?

788
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:28,830
There's something about
watching someone nail movement,

789
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:33,270
you know, it's just like, it's
inspiring. It's just like guitar,

790
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:34,590
what someone's shredding.

791
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:39,120
It's someone doing a drum solo and
it impacts everything. So I play,

792
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:42,870
I loved playing jumps and I have, I've
put a lot when I was a kid, less now.

793
00:46:42,930 --> 00:46:46,560
But I have basically a narrowed my
practice down to one thing, one thing.

794
00:46:46,561 --> 00:46:48,600
And I feel pretty fine about it,
you know?

795
00:46:48,601 --> 00:46:52,260
I feel like with that one kind of concept,
I can get where I want to go,

796
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:55,980
which is have any of my limbs do what
any of my other limbs can do. You know,

797
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:58,290
my left hand can do it.
My right foot has to be able to do it.

798
00:46:58,470 --> 00:47:01,260
My left foot can do it, vice
versa. You know what I'm saying?

799
00:47:01,290 --> 00:47:06,120
You have to be on heart. It has to
not make the that you want them. Nice.

800
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:10,080
And when I was doing that, I
started, I would notice myself,

801
00:47:10,081 --> 00:47:12,240
I'll sudden I'd be eating with my
left hand. You know what I mean?

802
00:47:12,241 --> 00:47:15,240
I wouldn't even think about it. I started
shooting basketballs and my left hand,

803
00:47:15,241 --> 00:47:19,400
I didn't even know. But yeah,
dude, I was fucking, no,

804
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,500
I mean I've missed the shot horribly.
But you know,

805
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:27,330
I think of drums can be as a person who
doesn't know how to play any musical

806
00:47:27,331 --> 00:47:30,220
instruments. I think of drums, sculpture.

807
00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:33,790
This is what I think I sing. I think
when you're, when you're drumming,

808
00:47:33,791 --> 00:47:36,280
like when I watch it,
like a heavy duty drum solo,

809
00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:41,550
I think half of what this guy has to do
is get away from whatever restrictions

810
00:47:44,141 --> 00:47:48,640
his body has on his movements.
Like half of what a drummer is doing,

811
00:47:48,790 --> 00:47:50,080
it's so physical.

812
00:47:50,230 --> 00:47:55,230
There's so much speed and coordination
involved that half of what you're doing

813
00:47:55,270 --> 00:48:00,270
is heightening your ability to move in
like the exact way you want it to move to

814
00:48:01,931 --> 00:48:05,590
create a certain sound. And a guy like
me, I can't do it. You know, if I,

815
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:08,890
if I brought them, I mean I
could eventually, I'm sure
learn how to play drums.

816
00:48:08,891 --> 00:48:09,520
What I'm saying,

817
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:13,000
like if I brought someone into my world
and made them do something that I do

818
00:48:13,001 --> 00:48:16,780
physically all the time,
like an odd thing, like play
pool or something like that.

819
00:48:16,781 --> 00:48:17,710
If they didn't know how to play pool,

820
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:20,920
it'll be real awkward and goofy
and the body wouldn't move. Right?

821
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:24,650
But if they know,
they know where the fucking stick is gone,

822
00:48:27,110 --> 00:48:29,260
I don't know how to do it.
Like I see this,

823
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:35,440
it's half of what he's doing is trying
to cut down on the amount of resistance

824
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,780
in his body,
listening to his mind

825
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:41,250
to make the sound. It's the same thing
with any instruments, violin or whatever.

826
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:43,860
It's just on a micro level. You know
what I mean? It's just more contained.

827
00:48:43,861 --> 00:48:46,260
And that's why I think martial
arts, dude, once we do that,

828
00:48:46,261 --> 00:48:47,280
we'll fucking take over the world.

829
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:49,950
Can you come on the road with us and
we'll give you John my hard to do,

830
00:48:49,951 --> 00:48:52,530
but we could do more shows like
we're doing new year's eve.

831
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:57,980
[inaudible] bitch,
if you guys want to go to that.

832
00:48:58,330 --> 00:49:00,940
There was not many tickets left.
I'll just tell you right now.

833
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:04,450
It's not even a October.
What is it?

834
00:49:04,451 --> 00:49:09,280
September 28th or something today.
What is the 28th? Um, but it's,

835
00:49:09,281 --> 00:49:13,960
it's a crazy show. It's a honey
honey. It's, um, Joey Diaz.

836
00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:19,220
Duncan Trussell, Ari Shaffir and me at
the Wiltern in Los Angeles. New years ago,

837
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:23,290
2016 were ready. We were here for the
end of the world. That didn't happen.

838
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:24,940
I think maybe because of us.

839
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:29,660
Whoa show. I think the show with you
mean Stan hope and Diaz had been,

840
00:49:29,661 --> 00:49:34,370
so you said this podcast and
things, the universe said, kill.

841
00:49:34,371 --> 00:49:38,780
Let's give these dumb monkeys a
chance. Pulled together. Pretty Dope.

842
00:49:38,990 --> 00:49:43,330
End of the Mayan calendar show, but
it was so fun and we said how, Hey,

843
00:49:43,331 --> 00:49:46,500
we got to do more of those. We'd
fucking never dead. We'd never done it,

844
00:49:46,990 --> 00:49:50,870
but we didn't for three years.
Three years from the last one.

845
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:55,470
It's been simmering that
Marriner was going to be writing.

846
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:58,210
You have no wine before it's time.

847
00:49:58,220 --> 00:50:02,480
Remember watching wells still
stills commercials. I don't
remember that. Yeah. See,

848
00:50:03,110 --> 00:50:06,620
you have to let her remember.
No women before the fight.
Rocky, the legs, the legs.

849
00:50:06,650 --> 00:50:07,483
Oh yeah.

850
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:12,230
I saw that on Youtube in a movie theater
back when there was no newspapers back

851
00:50:12,231 --> 00:50:14,600
when people were sending
messages on pigeons and shit.

852
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:17,630
They had smoke signals
if something was wrong.

853
00:50:18,430 --> 00:50:20,530
That's when I saw it.
That's amazing.

854
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:23,470
Lots of change. What were you
saying that you saw on Youtube?

855
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:25,360
You were talking about something
that you'd seen on Youtube.

856
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:29,990
We'll watch Spalding gray, Spalding gray.
So yeah, I saw that guy on television,

857
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:33,710
actual television and I
think he like he did movies.

858
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:37,170
He did some short films
too and like great. Yeah,

859
00:50:37,210 --> 00:50:40,390
I think he did like movies
of his storytelling, but
that's what they released.

860
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:45,050
Jonathon Dami shot this Cambodia
thing was the film. That's right.

861
00:50:45,051 --> 00:50:47,420
So He's in the movie theaters in my mind,

862
00:50:47,421 --> 00:50:50,060
for whatever reason it was on
HBO or something like that.

863
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:54,860
I guess that's not entirely correct.
I think it actually was a movie theater.

864
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:59,180
I'm trying to
pull the sound of the cubes,

865
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:03,960
the cubes, refill guys. I don't know. I
think I do a lot of time for round two.

866
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:09,060
We were talking about old people earlier
and it's interesting because bringing

867
00:51:09,061 --> 00:51:13,260
it all back, alcohol, there's so many
things. Oh Joe, you never have to.

868
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:16,030
But as a bartender shirts

869
00:51:18,050 --> 00:51:22,190
your bowels. It's the glass
break. She'd get new eyes,

870
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,080
he's got a solution. But that's
good. Thank you. So many lessons.

871
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:31,100
There are solutions out there.
I think about old people a lot.

872
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:36,350
When I get like you wake up and you
have a stiff neck and you're like you're

873
00:51:36,351 --> 00:51:41,180
miserable and you're like crotchety
cause your neck hurts or your shoulder or

874
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:44,600
whatever from the van or whatever we're
doing on tour and then I'm like this

875
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:46,430
must be what it's like to be old.
No,

876
00:51:46,431 --> 00:51:49,670
except like a hundred a hundred
times worth a hundred times worse.

877
00:51:49,730 --> 00:51:51,410
Like you have ailments all day.

878
00:51:51,411 --> 00:51:54,740
You might not have pooped for
four days and you need those.

879
00:51:54,741 --> 00:51:58,730
My mind is the balance thing. That's
what my son, my dad has neuropathy.

880
00:51:58,970 --> 00:52:00,620
Does that mean she's losing
the feeling in his feet?

881
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:04,340
Let's before we get into that,
is that the drink I was going to send him?

882
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:09,830
Oh No, no. He's going to
be going in. Okay. Yes.

883
00:52:09,890 --> 00:52:14,390
I'm going to ease up on this like cocaine
for Ben and cocaine is like cocaine

884
00:52:14,391 --> 00:52:15,224
for me.

885
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:21,530
Can I tell you guys something funny
while Ben Pours himself a drink,

886
00:52:22,730 --> 00:52:27,440
you want to choose there's black
and drink crushing everybody.

887
00:52:27,970 --> 00:52:31,530
Okay. All totally game.

888
00:52:31,531 --> 00:52:33,770
Peer pressured but it's working.

889
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:39,410
I know you and that Gal travel together.
You gotta you gotta find a comfortable,

890
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:43,980
but who do you think's driving?
You're not kidding. Listen,

891
00:52:43,990 --> 00:52:46,880
we have time please.
Plenty of places to eat around here.

892
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,730
It's great to be here. Yeah, please.

893
00:52:55,010 --> 00:52:56,870
So recently back to my
dad's health problems.

894
00:52:57,860 --> 00:53:00,950
People that are about to kick
off into the next dimension.

895
00:53:01,330 --> 00:53:05,780
Did you hear about those fucking people
that they were on that ghost hunter show

896
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:07,880
a murder suicide.

897
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:12,680
The husband killed the wife and killed
himself apparently or allegedly in real

898
00:53:12,681 --> 00:53:14,660
life and real life ghost hunting.

899
00:53:15,350 --> 00:53:19,640
One of those ghost hunting reality
shows and there was like a standoff.

900
00:53:21,410 --> 00:53:25,690
Apparently there had been
like some physical violence,
domestic violence issues,

901
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:26,040
mature

902
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:29,700
them before working partnerships.
And I think the girl was trying to,

903
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:32,160
the woman was trying to get
away from the guy allegedly,

904
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:34,770
I really shouldn't talk about
this cause my, my information,

905
00:53:34,771 --> 00:53:38,700
amount of information I had about
the actual, the actual, you know,

906
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:41,040
physical case that the murder suicide,

907
00:53:41,041 --> 00:53:44,760
it's very small but because I think
they're still investigating it. Right.

908
00:53:44,761 --> 00:53:48,390
You know the story really, really, really
recently, a couple of days ago. Yeah.

909
00:53:48,670 --> 00:53:52,560
Oh my God. Yeah. Terrifying. But I
mean how crazy is that these people,

910
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:55,020
you think about what a ghost
hunter is at the end of the day,

911
00:53:55,080 --> 00:54:00,000
besides a bullshit artist,
it goes under the end of the day.

912
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:04,860
What it goes tenor is, is a
historian of tragedy. Wow.

913
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:05,670
Cause all,

914
00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:10,670
you're always involved in some story
where there was a mass murderer.

915
00:54:11,070 --> 00:54:14,070
I don't not believe in ghosts.
I don't believe in ghosts,

916
00:54:14,370 --> 00:54:15,510
but I don't not believe in ghosts.

917
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:18,990
But what the idea would it goes
to is a ghost hunter is right.

918
00:54:19,230 --> 00:54:22,380
If you're a person who's going to
a psych ward, okay. And you're,

919
00:54:22,381 --> 00:54:24,000
you're waiting in the basement for ghosts,

920
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:27,690
you go into a place where people have been
murdered. Well yeah, yeah. But you're,

921
00:54:27,691 --> 00:54:32,640
you're also constantly
concentrating on murder.

922
00:54:33,330 --> 00:54:38,330
Constantly saying like for that and the
tension involved in the expectation of a

923
00:54:39,421 --> 00:54:42,540
TV show. Dude, if I don't, you
know, if it's not entertaining,

924
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:46,140
we're going to lose her job. None of them
were entertaining. So that's no problem.

925
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:47,640
Non Entertaining shows.

926
00:54:47,850 --> 00:54:51,240
Here's every ghost a hundred show that's
ever been night vision in the basement.

927
00:54:51,241 --> 00:54:53,400
What was that sound? Did you hear
that? And he didn't cut to commercial.

928
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:56,460
That's ever speaks every one of them.

929
00:54:56,490 --> 00:54:58,410
I don't know if we were speaking
about frequencies earlier,

930
00:54:58,411 --> 00:55:01,590
but I think we were maybe the thing
you thing, but there's a theory.

931
00:55:01,591 --> 00:55:06,390
This dude had that low frequency
sound like crazy low below 40 hertz,

932
00:55:06,391 --> 00:55:09,900
which is just like the military
experimented with like to dog.

933
00:55:09,901 --> 00:55:11,850
Sounds like with this is below that.
Yeah.

934
00:55:11,851 --> 00:55:15,600
They were saying buildings that produce
this kind of a frequency and machinery

935
00:55:15,601 --> 00:55:16,434
that does this.

936
00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:21,000
There's a correlation between haunted
houses and these places because this kind

937
00:55:21,001 --> 00:55:24,480
of frequency can induce hallucination
and people can induce really erratic

938
00:55:24,481 --> 00:55:28,790
behavior. It's crazy. There's,

939
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:29,940
there's the,

940
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:35,060
what frequency did Hitler had readers
like the forfeiture Ontarian what is it?

941
00:55:35,970 --> 00:55:40,200
Vegetarian. That was what
Hitler was, right? Vegetarian.

942
00:55:40,890 --> 00:55:45,240
Sure. He was really, Oh yeah.
Oh yeah. He's also an artist.

943
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:50,370
Mommy issues. Poor guy. You feel
like if he got to them early in life,

944
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:51,510
you can prevent it a lot.

945
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:55,410
I think you met him like when
you guys were both 20 bro,

946
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:57,670
we would've saved the angel of death.
Like,

947
00:55:57,990 --> 00:56:02,040
you know what I feel differently about
the things I was thinking about earlier.

948
00:56:02,070 --> 00:56:06,540
Maybe what you're going to do now.
Oh good luck for Hitler.

949
00:56:06,770 --> 00:56:09,990
Right? If you love that Song, love
that song. Hello. I love you guys.

950
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:14,910
Cool to be friends with someone that
you're friends with, fans of bizarre,

951
00:56:14,911 --> 00:56:19,110
you know, bizarre. You know, it's just,

952
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:22,740
we thought about you a lot.
Mushier and Montana. We were,

953
00:56:22,770 --> 00:56:24,010
we were in Montana for about two

954
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:27,260
weeks. Well, nationally. Yeah,

955
00:56:28,890 --> 00:56:32,980
I know. We were, it was so
beautiful. But like, you know,

956
00:56:32,981 --> 00:56:35,290
wilderness is everywhere and
everybody's like, you know,

957
00:56:35,291 --> 00:56:38,050
if you go up here you got to like
be careful. Like we were in Wyoming,

958
00:56:38,051 --> 00:56:41,230
we were in Yellowstone and you
know, we, we heard so many stories,

959
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:46,180
so many bear stories and things that like
really freaked me out because I mean,

960
00:56:46,690 --> 00:56:49,970
I don't have anything to defend myself.
I would like to go into nature.

961
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:52,450
You've got your width girl.
Yeah. Well, you're right.

962
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:55,160
You're cautious about
nature for the most part.

963
00:56:55,460 --> 00:57:00,080
The reality about animals for
the vast majority of instances,

964
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:02,450
the animals don't want to have
anything to do with people.

965
00:57:02,510 --> 00:57:05,210
They want to get the fuck away
from you. Well, that's not true.

966
00:57:05,670 --> 00:57:08,290
But when we were in Yellowstone, so I
heard all these stories about people like,

967
00:57:08,291 --> 00:57:10,660
you know, people get killed by
grizzlies a few times a year,

968
00:57:11,050 --> 00:57:15,190
and we were in Yellowstone and literally
a week later there was a hiker that got

969
00:57:15,191 --> 00:57:18,700
nabbed by Grizzly bear. You know, it just
depends on, it's like just bad timing.

970
00:57:18,990 --> 00:57:22,000
And I never ever want to put
myself in that position of that.

971
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:25,720
I got go camping here.
That's fine. You know,

972
00:57:25,721 --> 00:57:27,940
I'll go camping in Joshua tree

973
00:57:28,580 --> 00:57:29,720
timing in a way.

974
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:34,460
But it is also a lack of an understanding
of the environment for the most part,

975
00:57:34,461 --> 00:57:35,490
with a lot of them.
Sure.

976
00:57:35,570 --> 00:57:39,020
But although the one of the guys that got
killed recently was a very experienced

977
00:57:39,021 --> 00:57:41,240
hiker, so man, I might
have to take that back.

978
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:44,570
You could fuck up and zig when you
should've zagged. And the biggest,

979
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:48,680
the biggest fear is running into a
mother, to a mother. Bear with her cubs.

980
00:57:49,430 --> 00:57:53,470
Like, I can, I can appreciate
nature in a way that is, I,

981
00:57:53,820 --> 00:57:56,310
it's so fucking beautiful. And like, yeah,

982
00:57:56,350 --> 00:57:58,780
we drove through the park
and it was incredible and,

983
00:57:59,020 --> 00:58:02,560
but like I don't feel like I
need to sleep there and, and,

984
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:06,490
and like I can walk along the river by
the car and I feel fine and I know I

985
00:58:06,491 --> 00:58:09,460
might sound like a total
fucking charge right now, but,

986
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:14,470
but I really like what you thought of
being torn apart by an animal is utterly

987
00:58:14,471 --> 00:58:15,990
terrifying.
Intelligent

988
00:58:15,990 --> 00:58:19,500
approach. Okay. Yeah, it is a beautiful
thing. I think about being, I mean,

989
00:58:19,501 --> 00:58:23,250
they feel better ironman and experiencing
kind of caution and fear too.

990
00:58:23,251 --> 00:58:25,920
You're like, holy fuck, I'm a little
bit more connected now because yeah,

991
00:58:25,921 --> 00:58:29,790
I do actually have to be wary of something
threatening to me as opposed to just

992
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:32,190
unload.
I swear when you're there,

993
00:58:32,191 --> 00:58:37,191
that's not what you're thinking about
because the houses are so small and the

994
00:58:37,981 --> 00:58:39,900
reality of the beauty of it all,

995
00:58:39,930 --> 00:58:44,490
which is what the vast majority of the
experience is beautiful. The vast, vast,

996
00:58:44,491 --> 00:58:48,900
vast, vast, vast majority. The, The Times
that I've encountered bears in the wild.

997
00:58:49,230 --> 00:58:51,300
Claire's don't want to have
nothing to do with people.

998
00:58:51,301 --> 00:58:54,210
They want to get the groceries
and stuff. No, I have not.

999
00:58:54,211 --> 00:58:57,570
Some grizzlies stuff I'm talking about,
those are the ones who you have to worry,

1000
00:58:57,571 --> 00:59:01,520
but you just gotta be prepared. If
you bring guns, you know, you'll,

1001
00:59:01,521 --> 00:59:03,020
you'll always have to be repaired.
And you,

1002
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:05,370
we tried to shoot a grizzly
and it'll still easy,

1003
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:07,450
but there's also a lot of noisy
with the right kind of gun.

1004
00:59:07,910 --> 00:59:10,290
You have to have more than
one person and you have to be,

1005
00:59:10,410 --> 00:59:11,830
you have to be ready in case at Hammons.

1006
00:59:11,831 --> 00:59:13,500
But most of the time you don't shoot them.

1007
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:17,580
They shoot at the ground and you scare
them off and they're like, fuck this.

1008
00:59:17,581 --> 00:59:19,350
And they just get out of
there and then they go about,

1009
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:24,560
you can enter into the natural on in most
situations and get out without having

1010
00:59:25,221 --> 00:59:29,120
to do anything where something
dies where it didn't have to die.

1011
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:33,310
But there are occasions where
like I knew a guy who, uh,

1012
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:36,650
went hunting in Alaska and uh,

1013
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:40,160
they got charged by Grizzly bear and
wound up having to kill the grizzly bear.

1014
00:59:41,450 --> 00:59:44,320
The grizzly bear tried to get it there,
kill it was a,

1015
00:59:44,321 --> 00:59:46,010
it was actually a mother and they would,
you know,

1016
00:59:46,011 --> 00:59:47,750
they just didn't want to
have anything to do with her,

1017
00:59:48,140 --> 00:59:51,400
but she just decided she was going to
make a rush at them. And I've seen it,

1018
00:59:51,401 --> 00:59:55,000
I've seen it on video too.
I've seen people, yeah,

1019
00:59:55,010 --> 00:59:56,910
you're going out to kill
something in the wilderness.

1020
00:59:57,380 --> 01:00:00,170
You got to pick where you go. Honestly,
that's what I'm talking about.

1021
01:00:00,171 --> 01:00:03,470
Super Dangerous to go where grizzlies are.
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

1022
01:00:04,030 --> 01:00:08,250
The most scary places. Sure. National
Park, they used to have that show on, um,

1023
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:10,390
I think, I don't want to, was discovery
channel, whatever it was called,

1024
01:00:10,430 --> 01:00:13,280
called the hunt, who was the one
where the guy from Metallica,

1025
01:00:13,730 --> 01:00:18,430
James Hetfield from Metallica
is apparently a big time
hunter. And he hunted, uh,

1026
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:20,840
like he's a hundred all
over the world and he's a,

1027
01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:24,940
or at least a bunch of different species,
all these photos of him. And He, uh,

1028
01:00:25,070 --> 01:00:28,190
hosted this show where they
were hunting for grizzly bears.

1029
01:00:28,191 --> 01:00:32,180
It was like a really controversial show
cause you don't really eat grizzly bears.

1030
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:35,330
I mean you can, but they do
not, they're not endangered,

1031
01:00:35,331 --> 01:00:39,590
but they're not doing great. You know,
they're not like sort of flourishing.

1032
01:00:39,650 --> 01:00:44,180
They know how many they should kill
and they know how many they can kill.

1033
01:00:44,181 --> 01:00:44,651
They like date,

1034
01:00:44,651 --> 01:00:48,260
they have like this estimation that
wildlife biologists puppy off man,

1035
01:00:48,950 --> 01:00:52,010
take his pants up, fried Ben,
he's taking his pants off.

1036
01:00:53,030 --> 01:00:57,860
Risley's you're still here. But for the
most part, they don't fuck with people.

1037
01:00:57,890 --> 01:00:59,750
For the most part. They don't
want have anything to do with you.

1038
01:00:59,870 --> 01:01:02,300
For the most part, they'd rather get
away. They don't want to get shot.

1039
01:01:02,330 --> 01:01:03,410
They just want to stay away from people.

1040
01:01:03,820 --> 01:01:05,780
Well, so when we were up there, you know,

1041
01:01:05,781 --> 01:01:07,820
you were like hanging with
the locals and of course,

1042
01:01:07,821 --> 01:01:09,530
like I'm up from those areas.

1043
01:01:09,531 --> 01:01:12,290
So I have all these questions about what's
it like out there in nature. You know,

1044
01:01:12,291 --> 01:01:15,410
you live in, in Montana and you know, we,

1045
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:18,650
we met this guy who was just in,
maybe he was being dramatic,

1046
01:01:18,651 --> 01:01:21,740
but he was telling me all these
horrifying stories where I'm like,

1047
01:01:21,741 --> 01:01:25,580
why would anyone want to put
themselves in that position?

1048
01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:30,920
And I think it's a matter of,
like you said, being fully
aware of the environment,

1049
01:01:31,370 --> 01:01:34,170
having that, that preparation, you know,

1050
01:01:34,650 --> 01:01:37,110
stories people tell honestly,
like you're in that area.

1051
01:01:37,111 --> 01:01:41,730
And then there's like a whole culture
bear fear and things like that.

1052
01:01:41,930 --> 01:01:46,110
Um, and at least in certain areas, but
it's just like, that's what we talk about.

1053
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:49,590
We talk about how this
one guy who got killed in
Yellowstone, but it's like, it's,

1054
01:01:49,591 --> 01:01:50,910
I don't think it's the kind of threat,

1055
01:01:50,911 --> 01:01:52,890
I don't know why I'm reacting
so strongly to it right now,

1056
01:01:52,891 --> 01:01:56,250
but I feel like it's not the kind of
threat that you smoke the cocaine,

1057
01:01:57,340 --> 01:02:00,960
not the threat right now, right here.
Yeah. Know when you living in Los Angeles,

1058
01:02:00,961 --> 01:02:05,520
the hunger is a bear is not the threat,
but you're smart to be aware that it is.

1059
01:02:05,550 --> 01:02:07,050
It's on the table if you're out.
Yeah.

1060
01:02:07,490 --> 01:02:10,310
Well Joe, I love nature. I love to fish.

1061
01:02:10,311 --> 01:02:13,400
Fishing is one of my greatest passions
when I have the time to do it.

1062
01:02:13,490 --> 01:02:16,310
I fucking love it. I'm learning
how to fly fish. It's really fun.

1063
01:02:16,670 --> 01:02:19,010
And I have all these goals of
these places I want to go to.

1064
01:02:19,140 --> 01:02:21,270
They're places that scare me.
Like I don't,

1065
01:02:21,330 --> 01:02:25,320
I don't want to be fishing fly fishing
for salmon and there's a grizzly bear

1066
01:02:25,330 --> 01:02:28,680
across the river. Like that kind of thing
is like, and that's fine. I respect that.

1067
01:02:28,710 --> 01:02:33,450
I will stick with the area that I feel
safe and because I don't have a rifle on

1068
01:02:33,451 --> 01:02:37,500
me, I don't have Joe Rogan with his,
his, you know, acute target practice,

1069
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:40,670
you know what I mean?
So I think about this a lot because,

1070
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:42,240
well, you wouldn't want me, first of all,

1071
01:02:42,241 --> 01:02:46,740
you'd want someone who would be
teaching me. It'd be fun, whatever.

1072
01:02:48,470 --> 01:02:51,540
Like some of my friends that have been
lucky to be friends with the take me to

1073
01:02:51,541 --> 01:02:56,250
the woods, like Cameron Hanes or a Steve
Or, no, the guy who was that. Oh awesome.

1074
01:02:56,340 --> 01:02:57,890
That's great.
I like that.

1075
01:02:57,990 --> 01:03:02,260
Then that's like that's the best way
you want to go fishing with me and just

1076
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:07,920
talks about that a bunch of times like
we should do shows were take people for

1077
01:03:07,921 --> 01:03:10,350
the first time that had never been
hunting because it's such a bizarre

1078
01:03:10,351 --> 01:03:12,630
experience.
Even if you don't shoot anything,

1079
01:03:12,870 --> 01:03:16,290
just being in the woods in
Montana makes you go, oh my God.

1080
01:03:16,730 --> 01:03:19,800
Like it makes you realize
like, wow, life is very,

1081
01:03:19,830 --> 01:03:22,230
it's very different than
what we've accepted.

1082
01:03:22,470 --> 01:03:26,040
We've accepted that life is
cities and life is, you know,

1083
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:29,710
whole foods and life is,
well, here's the thing, Nate.

1084
01:03:29,790 --> 01:03:30,660
Sure.
If you want to talk about it,

1085
01:03:30,661 --> 01:03:33,780
like going out to nature and nature
is everywhere. Like we live in a city,

1086
01:03:33,781 --> 01:03:37,140
but nature is, is everywhere. It's in
the fucking middle of your sidewalk.

1087
01:03:37,170 --> 01:03:40,470
You know, there are bird, there
are crows, there are hawks.

1088
01:03:40,471 --> 01:03:44,790
I mean there's just so many. Like it's
everywhere. We live in the middle of it.

1089
01:03:44,910 --> 01:03:46,380
Coyotes,
mountain lions.

1090
01:03:46,580 --> 01:03:49,460
We also,
it's like we don't see nature a lot.

1091
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:52,850
So I think sometimes we look at nature
like an old girlfriend that we haven't

1092
01:03:52,851 --> 01:03:53,840
called it a long time.

1093
01:03:54,270 --> 01:03:59,270
We only have this like really elevated
idea of who she was and then you get back

1094
01:03:59,301 --> 01:04:01,940
with her and you realize this
pitch doesn't give a fuck about me.

1095
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:07,310
It's like that because when you're on
the top of a mountain and there's no cell

1096
01:04:07,311 --> 01:04:09,950
phone service and there's animals
creeping around and you're like,

1097
01:04:09,951 --> 01:04:13,390
this is a fucking dangerous
place to be standing still. Yeah.

1098
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:17,870
It doesn't care about you. Can I
give a fuck? Yeah, it's beautiful.

1099
01:04:17,871 --> 01:04:18,704
But I think

1100
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:22,530
that you're, that girlfriend is
here though. Like I think there's a,

1101
01:04:22,570 --> 01:04:26,530
this sad misconception with the way that
people treat quote unquote nature when

1102
01:04:26,531 --> 01:04:30,250
they drive out to a national park as
opposed to when they treat their urban

1103
01:04:30,251 --> 01:04:33,050
setting,
which is there is nature here and,

1104
01:04:33,250 --> 01:04:36,550
but people don't think about the fact
that they throw their trash out the window

1105
01:04:36,820 --> 01:04:39,610
and there's ducks in the pond right next.
You know all this stuff,

1106
01:04:39,611 --> 01:04:42,340
like you're still in nature.
Even if you're in a city,

1107
01:04:42,670 --> 01:04:44,680
you just need to treat it that way.

1108
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:47,820
Well, the idea that, you know, look
at the city is not being natural.

1109
01:04:47,821 --> 01:04:51,060
Spectrally sitting, not being
natural itself. Of course,

1110
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:55,020
it's all the bizarre,
the throwing of litter on the ground,

1111
01:04:55,230 --> 01:04:58,950
like when people want and really open
up their window and throw their garbage

1112
01:04:58,951 --> 01:05:00,750
out the window on the
highway. You're like, what?

1113
01:05:01,110 --> 01:05:04,230
That I just throw a bag and then
whenever we see that on the road,

1114
01:05:04,260 --> 01:05:07,710
I just want to fucking punch
him square in the throat.

1115
01:05:07,770 --> 01:05:10,260
It's so bizarre how many people do it.
Well,

1116
01:05:10,261 --> 01:05:14,280
they'll open up a window and throw a bag
out. Didn't happen. And you're like, what?

1117
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:18,060
Yeah, you just throw our garbage.
A Wendy's bag. Yeah. Yeah.

1118
01:05:18,090 --> 01:05:23,080
Like people are stupid or just like
a little piece of paper, you know,

1119
01:05:23,081 --> 01:05:27,100
like, like some fucking top of
something. You know over the gum.

1120
01:05:27,101 --> 01:05:30,010
You spit your gum out. The window
is really bad. Birds eat gum,

1121
01:05:30,070 --> 01:05:33,460
they think it's like a, a piece of
food and then they die. Fuck birds.

1122
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:35,920
Listen John,
the way out

1123
01:05:39,950 --> 01:05:43,510
there, there's so many fucking birds
and this is why it's really important.

1124
01:05:43,511 --> 01:05:48,190
If we get to talk to me, you can't take
me seriously ever. It's super important.

1125
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:50,513
Cats,

1126
01:05:53,970 --> 01:05:57,370
cats and you were like, cats are awful
because they have the thing in there.

1127
01:05:57,371 --> 01:05:59,890
They have the parasite.
Why didn't say it that way?

1128
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:03,650
And then you have the cheese
cats in the world them so much.

1129
01:06:04,630 --> 01:06:05,800
They're sweeties.

1130
01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:11,460
That's a cute cat cat's
term called making muffins.

1131
01:06:11,531 --> 01:06:12,880
You know when they need,

1132
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:18,030
they're so fucking you
like that too needy.

1133
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:22,020
Yeah, I would say it's more like
pizza dough. Okay. That works.

1134
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:25,230
They were worried when he called pizza
dough, just looking for the reaction.

1135
01:06:26,270 --> 01:06:30,850
Joey d is how the best bit about that.
About doing coke with his cat.

1136
01:06:30,850 --> 01:06:35,170
And this cat was doing that Paul
thing. It's hilarious. Betty,

1137
01:06:35,171 --> 01:06:39,130
you should do about doing coke with his
cat. What? I'm looking at one window.

1138
01:06:39,131 --> 01:06:41,630
He's looking at the other one.
Oh,

1139
01:06:42,250 --> 01:06:44,770
so freaking out a lot of the time,

1140
01:06:44,771 --> 01:06:48,130
like I think I kind of see that and we
know what they're their nature's cleanup

1141
01:06:48,131 --> 01:06:51,280
crew man. And the only reason you're
alive because you're way bigger than them.

1142
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:55,570
That's it. If you're smaller than a cat,
it would fucking eat you. You can't have,

1143
01:06:55,630 --> 01:07:00,630
you could have a dog and a pet durable
and you could teach that dog to not fuck

1144
01:07:03,071 --> 01:07:06,730
that durable up. You could teach
that jog. Hey Dude, listen to me man.

1145
01:07:06,731 --> 01:07:10,690
The Jermel off the menu and
the dog. Got It. Got It.

1146
01:07:10,930 --> 01:07:13,780
Don't kill the [inaudible] really badly.
You know.

1147
01:07:13,870 --> 01:07:17,050
How do you think dogs are with cats?
Like if dogs grow up with cats,

1148
01:07:17,051 --> 01:07:20,830
they're totally cool with that.
If they don't grow up with cats,

1149
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:25,000
they're fucking dangerous as shit around
the kill cats all the time. Right?

1150
01:07:25,170 --> 01:07:28,960
So they make these pretty insane cats.
Cats won't make

1151
01:07:31,150 --> 01:07:35,960
a pet rat and the cat in the house leave.
Watch what happens.

1152
01:07:38,670 --> 01:07:43,630
It's going to be like
Joe and you did the test with your cats.

1153
01:07:43,631 --> 01:07:45,490
I want to know.
I've never had a pet rat.

1154
01:07:46,060 --> 01:07:50,200
I do know that cats other than
like a few breeds of what?

1155
01:07:50,201 --> 01:07:55,201
Click Super Fluffy Persians that get
to that weird non aggressive state.

1156
01:07:55,871 --> 01:07:58,580
They're just these weird, they're
just branching cuddle. Yeah,

1157
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:03,220
the genetic aberrations.
That's her fucking predators.

1158
01:08:03,250 --> 01:08:05,240
The predators.
It's amazing.

1159
01:08:05,350 --> 01:08:10,350
Plus then you see these videos of like
huge African lions in like these reserved

1160
01:08:11,801 --> 01:08:16,220
areas of of Africa snuggling with the guys

1161
01:08:16,220 --> 01:08:18,710
that worked there on Youtube.

1162
01:08:18,770 --> 01:08:23,770
It can happen in the lion damn fed well
and they're taken care of well and their

1163
01:08:25,401 --> 01:08:26,121
raise,
well,

1164
01:08:26,121 --> 01:08:30,220
it's very obvious that there's some guys
that know how to make a friendship with

1165
01:08:30,221 --> 01:08:31,520
a lion.
You're starting to look,

1166
01:08:32,510 --> 01:08:36,140
but it's not that much different
than the idea of a wild dog.

1167
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:38,030
Like there was a few instances,

1168
01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:42,260
like I think there was one where
a couple was killed in Georgia.

1169
01:08:42,261 --> 01:08:45,530
I want to say it was like a
couple of years ago by wild dogs.

1170
01:08:45,531 --> 01:08:49,550
There's a pack of wild dogs to kill
these people cause people would let their

1171
01:08:49,551 --> 01:08:53,750
dogs loose and the dog's just never came
home. Or maybe they didn't feed him or,

1172
01:08:54,070 --> 01:08:56,840
and they became feral or
they were raised outside.

1173
01:08:57,080 --> 01:09:01,790
I read about cutting out a woman
in Canada singer. Yeah. Yes.

1174
01:09:01,791 --> 01:09:06,740
She told us about that. Joe
Did. She was killed about that.

1175
01:09:06,750 --> 01:09:09,140
Joe
told you,

1176
01:09:09,170 --> 01:09:13,730
but we stayed at a winery on
Saturday night, actually Joe,

1177
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:18,110
it was a really sweet Rogan Fan.
This, this fellow that was like,

1178
01:09:18,111 --> 01:09:20,900
you guys need a place to stay after the
show. And of course we do. You know,

1179
01:09:20,901 --> 01:09:24,650
you gotta save money.
Photos of you guys in naked online now.

1180
01:09:24,850 --> 01:09:28,310
They probably were sleeping. We
have never been naked. Everyone.

1181
01:09:29,060 --> 01:09:34,010
We're never nudes. That's never needs.
If you just operate like that, I

1182
01:09:37,850 --> 01:09:41,930
don't talk. And you never say the wrong
shit. Trust me. It's the way to go

1183
01:09:44,020 --> 01:09:48,580
play it safe guys talking,
always dressed. But we were,

1184
01:09:48,970 --> 01:09:52,490
we all slept in this fucking RV
and it was awesome. But they were,

1185
01:09:52,670 --> 01:09:56,570
they were like coyotes and it was great.
It was amazing. But you can hear it.

1186
01:09:56,571 --> 01:10:00,670
They were right outside. It was so
loud and they had this incredible like,

1187
01:10:01,590 --> 01:10:03,740
you know, it's, it's funny, but I thought,

1188
01:10:03,741 --> 01:10:06,050
I honestly makes feel
good about that story.

1189
01:10:06,050 --> 01:10:09,650
But that singer that you told us about,
about the girl that was hiking,

1190
01:10:10,180 --> 01:10:11,930
we've got to pack on the road.
We've got to pack.

1191
01:10:11,931 --> 01:10:15,110
They're not going to fuck
with us. I would, I would
tackle coyotes for you, Ben.

1192
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:16,133
You wouldn't even have,

1193
01:10:16,220 --> 01:10:20,630
I carry a Taser on me most times you
left it in the car like in a really weird

1194
01:10:20,631 --> 01:10:25,100
exposed place that it was one time
days or laying on the fucking seat.

1195
01:10:25,101 --> 01:10:29,060
Almost zap myself. You have to
turn it on properly so you're fine.

1196
01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:34,220
Maybe you left it on. I Dunno, I didn't.
You can't be alone with, yeah, that's it.

1197
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:41,150
You can be alone on the
same team, but she's talking
about the Taser thing. Sorry.

1198
01:10:42,130 --> 01:10:44,930
Yeah. If you're alone, they're going
to say, okay, there's a weakness here.

1199
01:10:44,931 --> 01:10:46,480
We can exploit it.
We're going to fucking dude.

1200
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:48,170
And the girl apparently was really small.

1201
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:53,150
She was like less than a hundred pounds
and they were like, we could do this.

1202
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:56,690
You can just fucking do it. And
they did. They did killed her.

1203
01:10:56,780 --> 01:10:59,600
We watch a lot of planet earth in the,

1204
01:10:59,601 --> 01:11:02,610
in the car and our travels and you know,
there's

1205
01:11:04,770 --> 01:11:05,480
no,
it's tough.

1206
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:09,440
Do you think that the way that you think
about that stuff has changed that you

1207
01:11:09,441 --> 01:11:14,030
have kids? It's like, oh fuck.
It's just accelerated. But
it was always there. Oh. So

1208
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:17,040
there was always bizarre
to me how dangerous

1209
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:22,010
natural world is and how it's right now,
dangerously we fuck with it. You know,

1210
01:11:22,011 --> 01:11:25,820
like we manipulate shit. Like I
said, I'm from Ohio and there was,

1211
01:11:25,850 --> 01:11:27,790
this is fucked up. Check
this shit out. Okay.

1212
01:11:28,010 --> 01:11:32,170
And the Cleveland Metro Parks
where I'm from and where I, my,

1213
01:11:32,300 --> 01:11:36,830
my family resides, there's obviously a
deer population that's out of control,

1214
01:11:36,831 --> 01:11:40,100
like a lot of places and people get
sick of hitting them with their cars.

1215
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:44,360
So they thought it was a good idea to
bring coyotes in to deplete the deer

1216
01:11:44,361 --> 01:11:48,140
population, which they're not
native to that area. So there,

1217
01:11:48,141 --> 01:11:52,670
there's coyotes in Ohio now, which is
so fucking weird. It's not natural.

1218
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:56,060
And like, you know, people start losing
their dog and they, they had like,

1219
01:11:56,150 --> 01:11:59,750
they don't think about those things.
And I remember hearing a story of a, of,

1220
01:12:00,410 --> 01:12:03,470
I don't know, I couldn't
tell you, but who the, um,

1221
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:06,530
a good family friend of ours
was telling the story that, uh,

1222
01:12:06,590 --> 01:12:09,680
her young children were playing in
the backyard as they always did.

1223
01:12:10,070 --> 01:12:12,530
And she looked outside the window and
she said there are two coyotes in there

1224
01:12:12,540 --> 01:12:14,180
treeline.
She ran outside and they're like,

1225
01:12:14,181 --> 01:12:17,570
her little kids were just playing there,
but people aren't used to that. You know?

1226
01:12:17,571 --> 01:12:20,600
It's not like you have Montana and you
know that there's bears there and you

1227
01:12:20,601 --> 01:12:24,200
know that there's wolves.
It's like this new introduction of,

1228
01:12:24,290 --> 01:12:28,970
of people manipulating with nature
and it's not not cool man. Okay,

1229
01:12:29,210 --> 01:12:33,950
well there was a lot of times people are
trying to right wrongs like that's what

1230
01:12:33,951 --> 01:12:37,490
they're trying to do with
the wolf population trying
to right the wrongs because

1231
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:40,910
they did poison wolves.
They used to be more wolves.

1232
01:12:42,110 --> 01:12:44,750
I'm not exactly sure if you,

1233
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:49,790
if you really want to be safe and
you really want to have a city and

1234
01:12:49,791 --> 01:12:53,870
civilization, I don't think you
want a large population of wolves.

1235
01:12:54,350 --> 01:12:57,920
I think it's probably super important
if you want to keep this whole people

1236
01:12:57,921 --> 01:13:02,390
thing going on at the level of going on
now where we can get new Samsung phones

1237
01:13:02,391 --> 01:13:03,224
every six months.

1238
01:13:05,190 --> 01:13:09,590
These fucking wolves around like this
shit is the whole reason why we invented

1239
01:13:09,591 --> 01:13:13,030
cities in the first place and the city
people forgot. Did you ever see that,

1240
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:17,480
that video about how wolves
changed the Yellowstone park?

1241
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:21,140
The the rivers? Yeah. Like
they do serve a purpose.

1242
01:13:21,850 --> 01:13:25,750
Yeah, but the purpose is an odd one.
The purpose is that of a Predator,

1243
01:13:25,810 --> 01:13:27,900
like it's like this
idea that the only one,

1244
01:13:27,910 --> 01:13:32,910
that one thermal balance
but not necessarily because
you don't want lions in La.

1245
01:13:33,850 --> 01:13:38,080
Okay. You just don't, but there are but
there's not ones but no, but they're,

1246
01:13:38,081 --> 01:13:42,880
they're cougars. They're smaller. There's
more scared put six but a large line,

1247
01:13:42,881 --> 01:13:44,110
like a 600 pound line.

1248
01:13:44,290 --> 01:13:46,900
Like what if a few of them started
living in La and we're like, hey,

1249
01:13:46,901 --> 01:13:48,070
we have to do with it man.

1250
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:52,420
You know what of the eat skateboarders
w we would have to like accept that.

1251
01:13:52,421 --> 01:13:56,050
That's fine. You can eat
the skateboarders. They're
a natural part of nature.

1252
01:13:56,230 --> 01:13:57,760
They have to,
they actually eat too.

1253
01:13:57,761 --> 01:14:01,270
We've been fucked that we would kill
those lions. Okay. We would kill them all.

1254
01:14:01,271 --> 01:14:05,120
Weed if they, if the line eight your
friend. Okay. If you came home one day,

1255
01:14:05,460 --> 01:14:06,610
mine was eating Ben,

1256
01:14:06,820 --> 01:14:08,980
what kind of an attitude you think
you'd have towards that line?

1257
01:14:09,130 --> 01:14:11,950
He'd be very upset with him.
Can we,

1258
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:17,140
can we get a little more detail
on the scenario because, well,

1259
01:14:18,130 --> 01:14:19,290
this is what happened,
but you know,

1260
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:23,500
we're just a flesh wound
president that decided to,

1261
01:14:23,790 --> 01:14:27,190
the only way for us to
have total compassion is to
open up the borders to all

1262
01:14:27,191 --> 01:14:28,210
plants and animals.

1263
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:33,280
I'm just trying to fill a barrel with
a proud extreme coyotes everywhere.

1264
01:14:33,461 --> 01:14:35,860
You look killing kids.
Too many kids. Fuck it.

1265
01:14:35,861 --> 01:14:39,340
We have to be a part of the solution.
I think there's a lot in predators.

1266
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:42,910
Take out people up to date.
Are you on Terminator?

1267
01:14:48,270 --> 01:14:51,760
We should end this podcast right now.
That would be a perfect way to end it.

1268
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:55,070
I'm not at all. I've
missed the boat. Come on.

1269
01:14:55,100 --> 01:14:58,340
We can fill you in on one and three if
you're interested. This is a new one.

1270
01:14:59,260 --> 01:15:02,680
Which one is the new? Is it just blue
ray? I didn't want one. Just came out.

1271
01:15:03,130 --> 01:15:04,070
Sign out yet.

1272
01:15:04,490 --> 01:15:09,490
I live in a small five of them from game
of Thrones and said Khaleesi oh wow.

1273
01:15:13,091 --> 01:15:17,550
They're really pretty girl. The
mother of dragons. Wow. Powerful.

1274
01:15:19,340 --> 01:15:22,930
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not on
speaking terms with the terminator,

1275
01:15:23,230 --> 01:15:27,730
but the problem is
I could go back and watch those movies.

1276
01:15:28,090 --> 01:15:29,530
There's a lot of movies I need to watch.

1277
01:15:29,740 --> 01:15:34,740
But what would really bothers me about
the terminator movie in particular is

1278
01:15:35,111 --> 01:15:40,111
that we might have like real
terminators talking about dude,

1279
01:15:40,391 --> 01:15:44,440
that that's why I wanted to bring up the
top 50 years might be a real problem.

1280
01:15:45,010 --> 01:15:48,550
People are talking about it.
Talking about Musk, Bill Gates,

1281
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:52,300
did you hear about that? Stephen Hawking,
they signed this letter to be like,

1282
01:15:52,330 --> 01:15:55,930
we cannot have AI, but it's weird
because they signed this letter.

1283
01:15:55,931 --> 01:16:00,680
We can't have autonomous,
uh, weaponry. Oh Jeez.

1284
01:16:00,770 --> 01:16:04,030
And then, uh, but they're also,
at least the Elon Musk is,

1285
01:16:04,031 --> 01:16:05,830
but a bunch of these
guys are investing in Ai.

1286
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:10,030
So it's like drawing that line because
they probably want to be ahead of it.

1287
01:16:10,031 --> 01:16:13,630
But first of all, yeah, and if you
are, if you're in the tech business,

1288
01:16:13,631 --> 01:16:16,540
hedging their bets. But if you're in
the business, like if you look at,

1289
01:16:16,810 --> 01:16:19,840
I mean I'm just assuming
that if you're a tech guy,

1290
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:24,460
like a part of what it is is about
innovation at its highest form.

1291
01:16:24,690 --> 01:16:28,210
Like what's innovation at its highest
form other than artificial intelligence.

1292
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:30,710
It's like the highest form of innovation.
Sure.

1293
01:16:30,730 --> 01:16:35,730
The creating of a life of some sort of
sentient being out of plastic and metal,

1294
01:16:37,750 --> 01:16:38,620
three d printing.

1295
01:16:38,621 --> 01:16:41,530
Like what's the same discussion as the
three d printing stuff with this dude,

1296
01:16:41,860 --> 01:16:44,980
Cody Wilson came out and was like,
I'm going to print guns because,

1297
01:16:45,460 --> 01:16:48,400
because it's someone's going to, yeah.
You know what I mean? And then like,

1298
01:16:48,580 --> 01:16:50,040
so you look at it and you say,
well,

1299
01:16:50,041 --> 01:16:52,570
it's something that we can't change if
it's something we can't change and what

1300
01:16:52,580 --> 01:16:57,400
does it to put our bunker? Oh God. Anyway,

1301
01:16:57,660 --> 01:17:01,210
were tiring. Joe Joe's tells
you and just some terrified.

1302
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:03,750
It's scary and maybe all I was so scared.

1303
01:17:05,990 --> 01:17:10,560
No something. I'm tired of hearing
about it. I said scared. No,

1304
01:17:10,561 --> 01:17:13,510
it's good of the society.
We,

1305
01:17:13,511 --> 01:17:18,080
we hang on a string all the time and it
just, we keep, keep fixing that string.

1306
01:17:18,380 --> 01:17:20,000
We're really good at keeping
the string going. Well,

1307
01:17:20,001 --> 01:17:24,680
we assumed that the string has to stay
and we know that that's not really true

1308
01:17:24,681 --> 01:17:29,180
and that's why we love movies about
where the string breaks and the Mad Max.

1309
01:17:29,190 --> 01:17:33,110
La Shit got crazy.
Where's the water park?

1310
01:17:33,390 --> 01:17:38,090
I know there's no law. There's no role.
You have to fight to the death. I mean we,

1311
01:17:38,150 --> 01:17:42,440
it's Barstow. You know, it's the
worst. If you go to Barstow right now,

1312
01:17:42,860 --> 01:17:47,240
it's fenced in in for 10 years
it would be thunder dome. Yeah.

1313
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:50,870
I mean there's, there's swats
we can manipulate and take off,

1314
01:17:50,871 --> 01:17:53,960
cut them off to the rest of the
world and they would be like that.

1315
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:56,390
And there's places that are like that. Now
we keep saying that and like, you know,

1316
01:17:56,391 --> 01:17:59,880
go to Africa, we've got to go to
Africa. John, but you went to Africa.

1317
01:17:59,881 --> 01:18:03,020
I go this parts of Africa that
probably crazier. Exactly this,

1318
01:18:03,140 --> 01:18:06,530
there's a great vice piece
on his place in Monrovia,

1319
01:18:06,650 --> 01:18:09,620
in Liberia where it's just like,
it's a total wasteland.

1320
01:18:09,621 --> 01:18:10,760
People are shitting in the street,

1321
01:18:10,940 --> 01:18:14,480
the governor or at some high political
official came down at shout on the beach

1322
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:16,400
just to be like, I'm one of
the people. And you know,

1323
01:18:16,410 --> 01:18:19,250
like this is how we're doing it.
That's what he did. Yeah, it's crazy.

1324
01:18:19,251 --> 01:18:22,040
It votes was that before Ebola broke out

1325
01:18:22,180 --> 01:18:25,560
because it was like people that that
was part of the like I didn't cause the

1326
01:18:25,580 --> 01:18:29,900
phone. Well yeah, it's, it's, it's all
the unsanitary conditions and stuff.

1327
01:18:29,901 --> 01:18:34,610
People living in filth. That's part of
it. I don't know. But, but you know,

1328
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:38,330
can I, I really feel fucking
really strongly about this.

1329
01:18:39,210 --> 01:18:44,210
Do we to talk just don't
really feel strongly about,

1330
01:18:45,260 --> 01:18:46,093
you know,

1331
01:18:46,550 --> 01:18:50,360
we're talking about like hanging by a
string and stuff like that and you know,

1332
01:18:50,361 --> 01:18:53,630
all God, the government sucks and all
this stuff and it's all, this is true.

1333
01:18:53,631 --> 01:18:57,100
There's, there's, you know,
you could click a button and
just kill a lot of people,

1334
01:18:57,620 --> 01:19:00,800
but at the end of the
day, while we're here, um,

1335
01:19:01,160 --> 01:19:05,420
there's some really beautiful things to
experience, like your shows, comedy shows,

1336
01:19:05,450 --> 01:19:09,410
and you make people feel good. And what
about, why is the beautiful, I look,

1337
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:13,850
I'm talking, going down the list here.
Let me have my moment. And you know,

1338
01:19:13,851 --> 01:19:16,250
there's all these incredible
things and you know,

1339
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:18,650
some something that we
get to see on the road.

1340
01:19:19,130 --> 01:19:22,160
Like we'll have like our scheduled honey
honey shows where you buy your tickets

1341
01:19:22,161 --> 01:19:26,110
and then occasionally we'll have these
really cool opportunities to play like um,

1342
01:19:26,660 --> 01:19:31,660
a concert series that like small towns
will have where they're not the most,

1343
01:19:31,701 --> 01:19:35,720
they have no idea who we are,
which is awesome because we'll go,

1344
01:19:35,750 --> 01:19:40,750
we went to this town and Dylan Colorado
where literally like I would say maybe

1345
01:19:41,241 --> 01:19:43,850
10% of the people were there to see us,

1346
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:46,580
but the rest of the people were there
cause they lived in the town and they

1347
01:19:46,581 --> 01:19:48,380
wanted to have their
entertainment for the night.

1348
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:51,620
And so there was all
these different people.

1349
01:19:51,621 --> 01:19:55,520
They were like really young families and
really old people and they all brought

1350
01:19:55,521 --> 01:20:00,230
their lawn chairs and beers and we were
in this outdoor amphitheater on this

1351
01:20:00,231 --> 01:20:04,040
lake and there's, you know, I don't
know, like five or 600 people there,

1352
01:20:04,340 --> 01:20:05,173
something like that.

1353
01:20:05,510 --> 01:20:10,410
And end it like it was such
a cool experience because
there was this collective

1354
01:20:10,411 --> 01:20:15,411
experience of all these people that came
together for whatever they needed at

1355
01:20:15,751 --> 01:20:19,400
the time that wasn't like, you know, it,

1356
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:24,180
it wasn't about us. We were offering
what we could to the situation,

1357
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:27,540
but at the end of the day it was really
beautiful because it was all these

1358
01:20:27,541 --> 01:20:30,360
people that were having this
experience together in their own way.

1359
01:20:30,361 --> 01:20:34,800
And it was different races,
demographics and,

1360
01:20:34,801 --> 01:20:38,730
and like it was just, we had this
moment and it was, it was really cool.

1361
01:20:38,731 --> 01:20:43,320
And I think right now when the world is
in this really funny place that's really

1362
01:20:43,321 --> 01:20:47,790
scary and we can put energy into
how scary it is and all that stuff,

1363
01:20:47,791 --> 01:20:50,820
but we can also put energy into these,
um,

1364
01:20:51,510 --> 01:20:55,550
experiences together where we're trying
to figure it out, you know, and like that.

1365
01:20:55,620 --> 01:20:56,880
I think that's really important.

1366
01:20:57,660 --> 01:20:57,820
Yeah.

1367
01:20:57,820 --> 01:21:01,600
I think most of what people are fighting
over has nothing to do with most of the

1368
01:21:01,601 --> 01:21:06,310
people. Yeah. You know, most
of the people in the world,

1369
01:21:06,650 --> 01:21:10,660
the, the, what do we want to do? We want
to just hang out with their friends,

1370
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:13,570
go to dinner. Yeah. We don't
want to take over the oil fields.

1371
01:21:14,050 --> 01:21:17,470
Most of the people just want to have
a good time. Most of the people,

1372
01:21:17,560 --> 01:21:22,120
there are a few people who like really
want to push that whole making money

1373
01:21:22,220 --> 01:21:24,760
envelope to the point where
we want to invade countries.

1374
01:21:25,630 --> 01:21:30,550
That's 90% of what's wrong
with us is it's not most of us,

1375
01:21:30,610 --> 01:21:31,443
most of us.

1376
01:21:32,020 --> 01:21:36,490
And I think this is what we're able to
do now that we weren't able to do before.

1377
01:21:36,780 --> 01:21:41,150
As most of us can talk to each
other, we can, you know, like you,

1378
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:43,660
you can get whatever you message out,

1379
01:21:44,470 --> 01:21:47,940
whatever your messages out in a way that
you've never been able to do before.

1380
01:21:48,100 --> 01:21:51,850
So if you want to do it in a song, do
you want to do it with an ebook? You can,

1381
01:21:51,851 --> 01:21:56,580
you can get your message out in this room.
Don't tell anybody. It's a tolerance,

1382
01:21:56,620 --> 01:21:58,540
a rap song that we love you

1383
01:22:01,060 --> 01:22:05,320
Brownie points if you're white.
Right.

1384
01:22:06,550 --> 01:22:10,870
But I think,
I mean this is the best time ever.

1385
01:22:11,140 --> 01:22:14,680
Like people that's, Oh, the world is
falling apart. No, I don't damn it.

1386
01:22:14,710 --> 01:22:18,670
I think it's always been fuck because
it's filled with people like the world's

1387
01:22:18,671 --> 01:22:20,770
always been fucked and win back.
Guess what?

1388
01:22:20,860 --> 01:22:25,210
People are fucked and we're
the best things on earth. Okay?

1389
01:22:25,810 --> 01:22:30,130
Turtles, goose island
with it is dark turtles.

1390
01:22:30,131 --> 01:22:31,840
You'd want to fucking kill yourself.
It's about a week.

1391
01:22:32,230 --> 01:22:34,790
If there was a million
living beings on the side,

1392
01:22:34,810 --> 01:22:38,350
the turtles one with these
beings, noon with them, please,

1393
01:22:38,351 --> 01:22:42,760
you shoot yourself right in the day.
If I gave you till two bullets,

1394
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:46,000
one of them was for the turtle that you
were going to kill to stay alive for the

1395
01:22:46,001 --> 01:22:49,210
first day and the second one, are you
going to put right in your fucking mouth?

1396
01:22:49,211 --> 01:22:51,880
Damn. You're like, I'm not living
with turtles for the rest of my life,

1397
01:22:51,910 --> 01:22:56,770
not doing it. How do you put the
turtle too is do you have Saracha?

1398
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:01,600
You just boil it. Just have to
bang rocks together. The light up.

1399
01:23:01,630 --> 01:23:05,980
Dry leaves. You got to get this.
You don't have to cook it just

1400
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:09,810
to make sure you kill the parasites.
It tastes terrible. Thank God.

1401
01:23:10,180 --> 01:23:13,330
That's a pretty awesome thing. That
food tastes so good. If you, you know,

1402
01:23:13,331 --> 01:23:15,790
you're talking about the context
of things, how the world's changed.

1403
01:23:15,910 --> 01:23:19,040
She didn't taste this good. Oh
it's too good. A lot of the time.

1404
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:21,160
Can we get art form now?

1405
01:23:21,490 --> 01:23:24,790
There's some art forms that are probably
been around for a long time with food,

1406
01:23:24,791 --> 01:23:27,940
right? Like cause a lot of
dishes, like there's some,

1407
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:32,140
I mean we ethnic dishes.
I started to do some work with farm aid,

1408
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:35,680
which has been really cool
and learned a lot about,

1409
01:23:35,980 --> 01:23:39,310
you know the whole fucking
structure of you know,

1410
01:23:39,370 --> 01:23:44,370
corporate food corporate literally like
all the hormonal shit and you know,

1411
01:23:44,410 --> 01:23:47,830
you, you're fine. I mean you've got your
like Moose and bear in your freezer.

1412
01:23:48,090 --> 01:23:52,650
Like your, your meat section is
covered. Thank God you guys enjoyed it.

1413
01:23:53,180 --> 01:23:56,350
It's okay. But, but you know,

1414
01:23:56,740 --> 01:24:01,270
they're the majority of the food that
people eat in, in their grocery stores.

1415
01:24:01,271 --> 01:24:03,640
You go to Safeway or you go
to fucking Piggly wiggly.

1416
01:24:03,850 --> 01:24:07,420
That shit is toxic and shit is awful.

1417
01:24:07,540 --> 01:24:12,160
It is God fucking awful.
I don't pin it will give you cancer.

1418
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:15,430
I don't think it's the show,
honestly. Here's the thing about me,

1419
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:18,490
like it's just how often
do you need and water.

1420
01:24:18,700 --> 01:24:22,000
If you ate that every day your she
would be fucked up. You'd be like,

1421
01:24:22,001 --> 01:24:25,540
why do I have acne? All of a sudden
you and free down not convince.

1422
01:24:25,541 --> 01:24:28,350
I don't know because this is the
only reason why I'm saying this.

1423
01:24:28,360 --> 01:24:32,230
What does a shitty protein? Well it's, I
don't know what it is or it isn't. See,

1424
01:24:32,231 --> 01:24:36,790
I don't understand. I see that. I just
want to be honest about it. I don't know.

1425
01:24:36,790 --> 01:24:39,820
Like what you actually get
off of a piece of meat.

1426
01:24:39,850 --> 01:24:44,740
It seems to me like logically I
am attracted to like a darker,

1427
01:24:44,890 --> 01:24:49,090
richer meat cause I feel like it'd
be a healthier animal more logically

1428
01:24:49,110 --> 01:24:52,120
essentially too. There's something
biologically doing like no, this is bad.

1429
01:24:52,660 --> 01:24:55,480
But then that's why it's counterintuitive
because like a lot of their like

1430
01:24:55,481 --> 01:24:58,960
really fatty cuts of meat are the ones
that people enjoy the most. You're right.

1431
01:24:58,961 --> 01:25:02,380
That's why they liked that. Why'd you,
why'd you hire say it, I don't know.

1432
01:25:02,381 --> 01:25:07,000
Japanese version of a beef with you
talking about fatty versions of meat that

1433
01:25:07,001 --> 01:25:11,410
have been processed to be
the appeal?

1434
01:25:11,411 --> 01:25:13,960
Like why would there,
I guess it was because like fats,

1435
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:16,570
fats have always been super
important because people,

1436
01:25:16,610 --> 01:25:20,320
well it was hard to get food and they help
you digest too. They do a lot of shit,

1437
01:25:20,440 --> 01:25:24,070
but it also like you really wanted like
the attraction to things that have a lot

1438
01:25:24,071 --> 01:25:24,904
of calories.

1439
01:25:25,030 --> 01:25:27,640
That was one of the most important things
where people were starving to death

1440
01:25:27,641 --> 01:25:29,650
all the time.
I have to get that fat,

1441
01:25:30,150 --> 01:25:34,270
like fat was important and big was like
keep it because like we gotta be big,

1442
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:37,120
but now you know, it's just, just
shows you how these things change.

1443
01:25:37,121 --> 01:25:40,620
Now bigger is kind of fucking
is over. Well, you know,
it's like over consumption,

1444
01:25:40,630 --> 01:25:42,790
but people are just so big now too.

1445
01:25:42,910 --> 01:25:46,660
Like there was a thing on TV the other
day about a kid who was in a senior in

1446
01:25:46,661 --> 01:25:50,110
high school. He's the biggest
football player ever. Whoa.

1447
01:25:50,170 --> 01:25:53,680
And he's a senior in high school.
Like he's seven feet tall,

1448
01:25:54,030 --> 01:25:58,510
440 pounds holy. And he's 17
years old. She's incredible.

1449
01:25:58,540 --> 01:26:03,290
It's insane. Like what? We're going
to go right to the fucking moon.

1450
01:26:03,291 --> 01:26:04,040
We're going to scrape the

1451
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:08,330
moon with our heads that we're going to
just keep getting bigger. That's the big,

1452
01:26:08,470 --> 01:26:09,850
that's the function.
People,

1453
01:26:10,460 --> 01:26:13,730
they're gonna gonna run out of oxygen
and start dying because they're going to

1454
01:26:13,731 --> 01:26:16,720
pass through. They're going to get to a
point a thousand years from now, we're,

1455
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:18,740
we're thousand.
We'll keep them out more about that.

1456
01:26:18,770 --> 01:26:22,640
That kid's diet and like what kind of
supplements he's taking and stuff like

1457
01:26:22,641 --> 01:26:23,270
that.

1458
01:26:23,270 --> 01:26:28,220
What did he eat if it was some crazy
lightning strike of like natural

1459
01:26:28,221 --> 01:26:31,700
phenomenon, that would be incredible
and I'm, I'm totally open to that,

1460
01:26:31,701 --> 01:26:35,630
but there's so many things like,
you know, like with processed meats,

1461
01:26:35,690 --> 01:26:39,390
like girls are getting their
periods at 11 today though. Yeah,

1462
01:26:39,590 --> 01:26:43,610
I mean that shit be fucking guys
standing there with a clipboard.

1463
01:26:43,620 --> 01:26:45,520
Have you started to bleed yet?

1464
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:53,190
Keep Margaret.
Who is this?

1465
01:26:53,191 --> 01:26:58,020
God is asking these fucking period
questions. Be a guy. Better be a woman.

1466
01:26:58,520 --> 01:27:01,590
I hope you have a woman doctor that's
not a fucking creek. I hope it's not.

1467
01:27:01,591 --> 01:27:05,880
Some creepy the first time arrested today?
No,

1468
01:27:05,950 --> 01:27:08,730
he got sentenced to, this
is, this is terrible story.

1469
01:27:09,030 --> 01:27:14,030
This guy got sentenced to only one year
of house arrest and he pleaded guilty to

1470
01:27:14,041 --> 01:27:17,370
fucking eight of his patients
while they were under whole man.

1471
01:27:19,370 --> 01:27:22,050
He only got a year of house arrest.
That's horrifying.

1472
01:27:22,140 --> 01:27:24,210
People feel thought he
was going to get 20 years.

1473
01:27:24,300 --> 01:27:29,220
They tell you his name and social
security. You'll Google it, find him.

1474
01:27:29,910 --> 01:27:34,770
It's awful. Oh, oh. I was
getting, it's a twisted dude.

1475
01:27:35,460 --> 01:27:38,220
Talk about an inappropriate story,
but I'm Oh too late.

1476
01:27:40,470 --> 01:27:41,303
First Time

1477
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:45,630
I had like a gynecology thing,

1478
01:27:45,631 --> 01:27:50,631
hollow like I was like 18 and it was a
male doctor and he was so hot that I like

1479
01:27:51,841 --> 01:27:55,230
did not know what to do with
myself. I remember being like, wow,

1480
01:27:55,231 --> 01:27:58,440
so while it's a scene in a porn,

1481
01:27:59,460 --> 01:28:00,780
it really was incredible.

1482
01:28:00,810 --> 01:28:04,940
I had my pelvis zapped with an electric
needle by a beautiful dermatologist.

1483
01:28:10,140 --> 01:28:11,860
God look at it and give you the thumbs up.

1484
01:28:11,861 --> 01:28:16,390
That's when it would have been really
weird about what the guy wasn't. I can't,

1485
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:19,840
I wasn't there. I can't accept
while you are still in the building.

1486
01:28:19,841 --> 01:28:22,460
She's going to go to the restroom.
She might not want to talk about that.

1487
01:28:23,380 --> 01:28:26,920
Trying to get out of it. She had to
hold her to the fire. That's true.

1488
01:28:26,980 --> 01:28:28,000
It's a vagina thing.

1489
01:28:28,030 --> 01:28:30,400
That's considered for girls
talking to a story about a vagina.

1490
01:28:30,401 --> 01:28:33,290
You have to either comes or it doesn't
come. You can't like go. Come on,

1491
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:37,330
tell it to us
and they will love that.

1492
01:28:37,630 --> 01:28:40,720
I think she'll love it. They
get mad. What happened? Come on.

1493
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:45,170
Well this is kind of weird though.
What's up with your Dick? What's up?

1494
01:28:51,160 --> 01:28:54,850
So you were having a big problem.
That's the deal.

1495
01:28:55,300 --> 01:28:59,810
The Dick or the Dick
problems at pedals game.

1496
01:28:59,950 --> 01:29:04,440
What kind of did problem talking about
here? Phelan had a bandaid on my dick.

1497
01:29:04,441 --> 01:29:07,710
Once vaginas are infinitely
more sensitive to criticism.

1498
01:29:08,340 --> 01:29:11,190
You know like you can make a joke
about a dude having a stinky Dick.

1499
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:16,880
But if you make a joke on stage about
a woman's mallow tourist vagina,

1500
01:29:18,180 --> 01:29:20,610
sure you will be a terrible person.

1501
01:29:20,940 --> 01:29:22,620
Did they want to have
anything to do with you?

1502
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:24,930
Even if you're telling a true story.

1503
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:28,170
If you did tell us true story
about a woman stinky vagina,

1504
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:32,220
you would have to like really
word it. Well, you feel
like it's a double standard.

1505
01:29:32,820 --> 01:29:37,260
Yes, I do, but it's got to start
doing it. You got to lead the charge.

1506
01:29:37,261 --> 01:29:38,250
This is my thing.

1507
01:29:38,580 --> 01:29:43,440
I don't think necessarily that all
double standard double standards, uh,

1508
01:29:44,010 --> 01:29:46,050
are there because of inequality.

1509
01:29:46,710 --> 01:29:50,880
I think some double standards are there
because we want to quantify things

1510
01:29:51,060 --> 01:29:54,180
instead of just looking at them as being
completely different. Sure. He tell it,

1511
01:29:54,181 --> 01:29:57,750
dude is a cat. Dick Stinks and
it goes, all right, I'll wash it.

1512
01:29:58,610 --> 01:29:59,443
But also wildlife,

1513
01:29:59,640 --> 01:30:03,350
it's really gotta be serious if
you're up close to it and yeah,

1514
01:30:03,450 --> 01:30:07,130
it might be stinky as fuck.
It's very possible. If

1515
01:30:08,630 --> 01:30:11,760
you don't clean your Dick, it's very
possible you dick could be stinky. Sure.

1516
01:30:11,900 --> 01:30:14,220
The differences,
penises,

1517
01:30:16,350 --> 01:30:21,350
stinky decks versus Stinky vaginas
that a man saying a woman's vagina,

1518
01:30:21,790 --> 01:30:25,600
his stinky is like a terrible thing to do.
It's like it's a,

1519
01:30:25,810 --> 01:30:29,140
there is a double standard because
it is different. It's, it's,

1520
01:30:31,050 --> 01:30:35,010
it's a more powerful statement.
Yes.

1521
01:30:35,011 --> 01:30:38,010
Because if you tell a dude that is
dicks thinks, he goes, all right,

1522
01:30:38,011 --> 01:30:41,160
I don't wash my dick. Like that's it.
And you know once you wash your Dick,

1523
01:30:41,161 --> 01:30:43,980
it's clean. It's not going to continue
to, I'm doing freak out about it.

1524
01:30:43,981 --> 01:30:46,620
They'd be like, well what do you mean
what's my only, those guys are paid.

1525
01:30:47,550 --> 01:30:50,640
Most cats are just going to
watch their decade woman.

1526
01:30:50,641 --> 01:30:54,030
You're dealing with an
internal flora issue,

1527
01:30:55,410 --> 01:31:00,390
right? That's true. That's the issue of
having any sort of a yeast infection.

1528
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:03,690
It's actually like you,
it's lifeforms living in your cooter.

1529
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:05,850
That's way more sense.
Team size

1530
01:31:07,410 --> 01:31:12,410
affects the smell of your ges showed in
thinking about that for the last hour.

1531
01:31:16,380 --> 01:31:20,310
Well, we know it affects the smell of
your pee. Right? If you eat asparagus,

1532
01:31:20,311 --> 01:31:22,740
you can smell your asparagus
while you're peeing.

1533
01:31:22,770 --> 01:31:26,210
I got to assume that makes it into
your, your calm as well. Yeah.

1534
01:31:26,340 --> 01:31:29,250
The only makes sense.
I think lighter.

1535
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:32,230
You brought up the gynecologists

1536
01:31:35,160 --> 01:31:38,910
locking eyes with each other. Just we
went right to the toilet. Felt that too.

1537
01:31:38,940 --> 01:31:42,270
We want to write into the toilet and
started talking about stinky dicks.

1538
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:50,340
Not the direction I liked for
us to lead. It is what it is.

1539
01:31:50,750 --> 01:31:54,390
It is what it is. Live with
it. It's a funny thing.

1540
01:31:54,420 --> 01:31:57,340
But do you think that that's
why it's funny. It's like it's,

1541
01:31:57,370 --> 01:32:00,790
it's Ruder for some
whatever biological reason.

1542
01:32:01,140 --> 01:32:05,920
It's a router for man to mock a woman's
stinky vagina in a cruel fashion.

1543
01:32:06,190 --> 01:32:07,560
Do you think that security,

1544
01:32:07,720 --> 01:32:11,470
I think that's like a degrading
thing that you want to like, um,

1545
01:32:12,130 --> 01:32:16,120
just sort of a d value.
A woman's may be national place,

1546
01:32:16,440 --> 01:32:17,290
very possibly,

1547
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:21,520
but it's also equally
negative on the other side.

1548
01:32:21,521 --> 01:32:25,650
When a woman mocks a man
for having a tiny Dick, Ooh,

1549
01:32:25,730 --> 01:32:29,650
not the size of the dots.
Like I swear by that lies, but

1550
01:32:33,430 --> 01:32:36,340
if a guy has a microchip for guys,
a little tiny deck,

1551
01:32:36,430 --> 01:32:38,620
like there's these guys that have
like micro objects like that.

1552
01:32:39,650 --> 01:32:44,020
And if it's like full on,
showed a tiny one,

1553
01:32:44,021 --> 01:32:47,860
like a little one, I'm saying like, oh
terror. Terrifyingly small little there.

1554
01:32:48,730 --> 01:32:52,300
And if someone mocks that, he's
really funny. Well that'll help.

1555
01:32:52,690 --> 01:32:57,160
But it's less offensive to make fun of
a stinky pussy than it is to make fun of

1556
01:32:57,161 --> 01:33:01,130
that because I think a stinky pussy
you can clean up. That's fine.

1557
01:33:02,110 --> 01:33:05,680
That's fine. All you need is some as
a dolphin. Listen, your life girl,

1558
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:11,920
some wild Kimchi.
Need some raw foods.

1559
01:33:12,460 --> 01:33:16,870
Take care of your flora and my mom
and dad never listened to this.

1560
01:33:17,490 --> 01:33:20,360
Molly will, they've been
listening. You know what's up?

1561
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:25,450
These chairs are fucking
dope, dude. They're not bad.
They're very good. Ergo depot,

1562
01:33:25,650 --> 01:33:27,820
shout out to Earl depot.
They sent him to us.

1563
01:33:27,821 --> 01:33:31,210
I was skeptical at first because I
had one before that was like super

1564
01:33:31,211 --> 01:33:34,600
uncomfortable. It was like one of those
knee ones where you go on your knees,

1565
01:33:34,900 --> 01:33:37,800
you know what I'm talking about.
You're in your, on your buttons,

1566
01:33:37,801 --> 01:33:40,270
some sort of a weird way and you're
going to tough to get used to,

1567
01:33:40,360 --> 01:33:44,080
but they do make you keep good posture
and then I got this other one that was

1568
01:33:44,081 --> 01:33:49,081
like a saddle within this dude from
Ergo depot hollered at me all he said,

1569
01:33:49,841 --> 01:33:51,610
those are not good for long term.

1570
01:33:51,611 --> 01:33:53,500
It's like you're sitting at a
desk for a long period of time.

1571
01:33:53,500 --> 01:33:55,810
You need something like this.
And he sent it to me and I was like,

1572
01:33:55,811 --> 01:33:58,950
but it looks like a regular chair. And
then you sit in it and you go, Oh shit.

1573
01:33:58,951 --> 01:34:02,070
It's called a cup pisco. That's what's
called you sit it and you go, Oh yeah,

1574
01:34:02,071 --> 01:34:07,030
I've perfect fucking posture.
All of these studies on your posture,

1575
01:34:07,720 --> 01:34:11,390
your posture
grenades,

1576
01:34:11,460 --> 01:34:14,260
people are watching you
and listening. Um, but,

1577
01:34:14,500 --> 01:34:17,980
but like the way your
body language expresses,

1578
01:34:18,670 --> 01:34:22,030
like there's certain
chemicals don't get crazy.

1579
01:34:22,100 --> 01:34:25,690
There were studies like this,
you know,

1580
01:34:25,720 --> 01:34:30,220
there's this like power stance that's
the Dick forward showing it's called the

1581
01:34:30,221 --> 01:34:34,330
Dick for no when guys are all,
so I go,

1582
01:34:34,810 --> 01:34:37,180
I put my feet up on the desk and I go,
Dick Forward.

1583
01:34:37,650 --> 01:34:42,220
You kind of know like guitar to
sound like a mood that's like a dick.

1584
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:46,240
It's like a horse stance.
Oh, that's, is that true?

1585
01:34:50,110 --> 01:34:55,060
Why did I not know that
he's being serious? She was
serious. Yeah, I'm serious.

1586
01:34:55,420 --> 01:34:59,240
It's serious now. So Tig, dig,
dig straight down the river bend.

1587
01:34:59,241 --> 01:35:02,360
Let me have this dream.
Why don't we all just fucking sit back.

1588
01:35:02,660 --> 01:35:03,770
But if you sound like board,

1589
01:35:03,771 --> 01:35:07,400
especially if a guy has like maybe some
sort of an alligator skin cowboy boots

1590
01:35:07,401 --> 01:35:11,930
on and he puts his feet down on the
ground in some sort of an office chair,

1591
01:35:12,230 --> 01:35:15,790
you know what I'm saying? Some sort of
a risky environment. Yeah. And then, uh,

1592
01:35:15,830 --> 01:35:18,320
puts his hands behind his head,
leans back and goes, well,

1593
01:35:18,321 --> 01:35:20,360
how much do you like this job?

1594
01:35:21,530 --> 01:35:24,260
Not May know Tom about to go dig for,

1595
01:35:24,950 --> 01:35:28,370
hold on Y'all goals released
from that physical position.

1596
01:35:28,371 --> 01:35:30,470
Like you're fucking like,
Shit's going on for you.

1597
01:35:30,471 --> 01:35:34,880
Like you're getting more powerful by
sitting like that. Like Thor's hammer,

1598
01:35:35,720 --> 01:35:39,440
like Thor,
they say that about smiles right there.

1599
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:44,320
Like when you smile, it actually, it
actually has an effect on your brain,

1600
01:35:44,810 --> 01:35:49,280
gives you a certain amount of happiness.
Now my problem with that,

1601
01:35:51,560 --> 01:35:55,330
I think mean it's positive. It's great.
Let's not sell our souls. So short. Yeah.

1602
01:35:56,360 --> 01:36:00,650
Fake it till you mean it. Hello? Oh Shit.

1603
01:36:01,250 --> 01:36:05,070
That's so beautiful to sing a song
we went to eat. You wouldn't beat,

1604
01:36:05,410 --> 01:36:08,360
wasn't even that good. Other
than that? No. Definitely not.

1605
01:36:09,360 --> 01:36:11,150
People at home,

1606
01:36:15,790 --> 01:36:20,070
we're, I need this. Your paths

1607
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:25,970
have no emotions. Pretend you
do grow. They'll grow water.

1608
01:36:25,971 --> 01:36:30,520
Then with the tears of others.
Here's honey, honey. What?
They're fucking new hair.

1609
01:36:30,540 --> 01:36:35,090
That was delicious. Yeah.
This is a slam poem.

1610
01:36:35,091 --> 01:36:36,640
It's even worse than a regular problem.

1611
01:36:37,910 --> 01:36:41,270
Have you ever been to say it
in a voice that's not mine?

1612
01:36:42,410 --> 01:36:46,850
Always here and always on time.
Top of the mountain.

1613
01:36:47,030 --> 01:36:51,260
Bottom of the gully.
I been here before.

1614
01:36:51,290 --> 01:36:54,860
My friend Sally Jeanette
didn't have to ride

1615
01:36:58,590 --> 01:37:01,070
strong immigrant background
with a very good work ethic.

1616
01:37:01,071 --> 01:37:03,590
You got to make some shit, Ryan, if
you want to call it a poem. All right.

1617
01:37:03,591 --> 01:37:07,910
You can't just say a bunch of shit.
The lightning hits the thunder.

1618
01:37:07,970 --> 01:37:09,730
I'm on the street.
Why is he

1619
01:37:11,930 --> 01:37:14,570
doesn't love me as much
as he loves his new wife.

1620
01:37:14,750 --> 01:37:18,560
As I get in my car and I
wish my tire wasn't flat,

1621
01:37:18,561 --> 01:37:21,050
but it is deal with it.
I can't

1622
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:28,190
tell on me. My alarm wakes up. I
wish my life was that interesting.

1623
01:37:28,191 --> 01:37:29,960
Back to the grind

1624
01:37:36,430 --> 01:37:41,430
and then I light my cigarette
and everybody just captured that.

1625
01:37:42,200 --> 01:37:43,033
You captured it.

1626
01:37:45,410 --> 01:37:47,790
You let your cigarette in this one
single tear and everyone was like,

1627
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:53,300
everyone has a bone in your acting
days. I cry like a bitch, man.

1628
01:37:53,420 --> 01:37:56,160
Oh, fucking cry. People
get mad at me because

1629
01:37:56,160 --> 01:38:00,480
I cried so easy. But I just get it. I
don't cry for sad things. It's a weird,

1630
01:38:00,570 --> 01:38:03,960
I'm a weird person in that
way for like powerful thing.

1631
01:38:03,990 --> 01:38:08,630
That's fucking sad things. Sad
things make me really sad. But um,

1632
01:38:08,640 --> 01:38:10,350
I mean I can absolutely cry from them,

1633
01:38:10,530 --> 01:38:15,120
but a lot of times like involuntary
tears come from a really happy things.

1634
01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:17,690
It does is a useful, I
kind of was like, uh,

1635
01:38:17,910 --> 01:38:19,500
like I'll be talking
to somebody on the POC,

1636
01:38:19,570 --> 01:38:22,750
like Rhonda Rousey when she was in here.
I love talking to her about her,

1637
01:38:22,751 --> 01:38:27,751
her dad and her dad committed suicide
man and this chick that she was fighting

1638
01:38:28,201 --> 01:38:32,910
in her last fight. Oh, I saw it said
something that she interpreted as like,

1639
01:38:32,911 --> 01:38:34,890
she might kill herself like her father.

1640
01:38:35,190 --> 01:38:37,770
And you know whether or not that
was exactly what that girl man,

1641
01:38:37,771 --> 01:38:40,960
it didn't matter cause that's what
Ronda saw and that's what she,

1642
01:38:40,980 --> 01:38:43,250
and then she went out there and beat
the shit out that girl. And I was like,

1643
01:38:43,290 --> 01:38:47,880
no fucking crazy. But it
was, it was so, uh, it was,

1644
01:38:47,940 --> 01:38:51,600
it was, it was so crazy. It was
like this weird moment in history.

1645
01:38:51,780 --> 01:38:55,470
There was like this w like I have this
feeling for a minute that I was in this

1646
01:38:55,471 --> 01:38:58,350
place that there's going to
be a come a point in time.

1647
01:38:58,351 --> 01:39:01,830
It didn't matter if the girl
wasn't the right opponent for her.

1648
01:39:01,831 --> 01:39:05,280
Like w it didn't matter where the
girl was like a in her league,

1649
01:39:05,490 --> 01:39:10,140
what it was was what had happened in
this country with his chick had come

1650
01:39:10,141 --> 01:39:12,960
overseas, just beat the fuck
out of this girl on paper view.

1651
01:39:13,210 --> 01:39:15,480
I know it's a girl and then like,

1652
01:39:15,481 --> 01:39:18,600
so you have this crazy sport that
everybody resists. Like, oh my God,

1653
01:39:18,601 --> 01:39:21,180
it's barbaric. It's masculinity.
It's most toxic load.

1654
01:39:21,420 --> 01:39:25,260
The biggest star is a hot chick.
The base star,

1655
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:30,300
the biggest stars sweat this.
The biggest star in the craziest,

1656
01:39:30,301 --> 01:39:35,301
most violent sport the world has ever
known is a beautiful woman who's highly

1657
01:39:35,551 --> 01:39:36,211
skilled,

1658
01:39:36,211 --> 01:39:41,100
who is a living Charlie's angels movie
who flies to other continents to beat the

1659
01:39:41,101 --> 01:39:45,960
fuck out of it. Just exactly
about a girl job. But girl, who,

1660
01:39:45,961 --> 01:39:49,250
if she decided to starve herself,
she could easily be a model. Right?

1661
01:39:49,290 --> 01:39:53,010
She's beautiful. Instead she
chooses to get an a metal tube,

1662
01:39:53,011 --> 01:39:56,460
a flight of South America. It'd beat the
fuck out of some chick on paper view.

1663
01:39:56,700 --> 01:39:59,640
And when you're there and you watch that
happen and you watched this paradigm

1664
01:39:59,641 --> 01:40:03,870
shifting moment, like for me,
I was like, Whoa, did you cry?

1665
01:40:04,220 --> 01:40:05,490
I almost did.

1666
01:40:05,491 --> 01:40:09,330
Then I almost did when I was interviewing
her and the tier leaked out a little

1667
01:40:09,331 --> 01:40:11,790
bit when I had her on the show
and I talked about it. Yeah.

1668
01:40:12,390 --> 01:40:14,910
But I almost cried when I was
talking to Connor Mcgregor.

1669
01:40:15,630 --> 01:40:18,120
I was talking to Connor Mcgregor
after he beat Chad Mendez.

1670
01:40:18,121 --> 01:40:21,720
When I was talking to, I was talking about
Ireland, Irish people in the audience.

1671
01:40:21,980 --> 01:40:22,370
Then in

1672
01:40:22,370 --> 01:40:27,230
in, in Vancouver. You guys were in
Vancouver while was happening? Uh,

1673
01:40:27,470 --> 01:40:32,450
he fought, the guy was from
Chad Mendez from California
will. Yes. We, we literally,

1674
01:40:32,540 --> 01:40:35,630
Joe,
we watched that show from a sports bar.

1675
01:40:36,260 --> 01:40:39,140
We didn't know who was coming to our
show in Vancouver. And I said to Ben,

1676
01:40:39,141 --> 01:40:43,400
I was like, I'll bet a bunch of people
from this bar are coming to our show.

1677
01:40:43,640 --> 01:40:47,300
And it was weird because it wasn't a
market that we're really, um, you know,

1678
01:40:47,301 --> 01:40:50,030
it's prevalent in,
and I'm not even joking you,

1679
01:40:50,060 --> 01:40:54,130
like 95% of the people that
were at that show were rogue

1680
01:40:54,140 --> 01:40:58,990
Rogan fans and they ha they were watching
that fight. So it was weird. Like I,

1681
01:40:59,030 --> 01:41:01,960
I,
you'd be amazed at how many parallels are,

1682
01:41:02,200 --> 01:41:04,600
we all have these
prejudices against people.

1683
01:41:05,150 --> 01:41:08,230
Like people that would be into
like MMA wouldn't be in the yolk,

1684
01:41:08,231 --> 01:41:11,920
your kind of music, but you're totally
wrong. We're all totally wrong.

1685
01:41:11,921 --> 01:41:14,260
We're all scared. We're
all like, you know,

1686
01:41:14,261 --> 01:41:16,390
we were talking about earlier
about like the natural world,

1687
01:41:16,990 --> 01:41:20,180
we're all like terrified of all
the dangers of like, you know,

1688
01:41:20,200 --> 01:41:23,050
when people didn't have the internet
and they didn't know who the people were

1689
01:41:23,051 --> 01:41:27,280
that were coming in boats,
we have less and less to fear.

1690
01:41:27,281 --> 01:41:28,990
We're more and more like each other.

1691
01:41:29,290 --> 01:41:32,230
And were we realized that more
and more on a daily basis.

1692
01:41:32,740 --> 01:41:37,740
So like when the mergings of our sort of
fans is like perfect example that like

1693
01:41:38,770 --> 01:41:42,760
universally the people that I introduced
to you, I don't want to play guys up,

1694
01:41:43,120 --> 01:41:46,990
but universally they love you. I mean,
you guys are awesome. It's not like I go,

1695
01:41:46,991 --> 01:41:50,860
hey, these guys suck. But they're
cool. They're fun to hang out with.

1696
01:41:51,340 --> 01:41:54,720
If I tell you I love them, I like,
I'm telling you these guys are,

1697
01:41:54,721 --> 01:41:58,480
there's something going on. And if you're
telling people that in your community,

1698
01:41:58,481 --> 01:42:01,090
a lot of the time they're really open
people too. You know what I mean?

1699
01:42:01,091 --> 01:42:04,540
That's well that plays a big role.
I think we could be, we thought,

1700
01:42:04,541 --> 01:42:08,170
we all thought that we had
issues with each other.

1701
01:42:08,440 --> 01:42:11,770
We were all thought like that somehow
or another you couldn't be athletic and

1702
01:42:11,771 --> 01:42:14,170
also like books. No. When you want
to talk to you about those books,

1703
01:42:14,680 --> 01:42:17,590
he couldn't be in the documentaries
but also be in the martial arts.

1704
01:42:17,770 --> 01:42:18,640
You couldn't do that.

1705
01:42:18,641 --> 01:42:21,730
You couldn't do that because you were
either like a meathead or you were a

1706
01:42:21,731 --> 01:42:25,120
nuanced person who wasn't worried
about physical activities.

1707
01:42:25,330 --> 01:42:28,710
Like you couldn't be both
like peop people. It's so,

1708
01:42:28,990 --> 01:42:33,340
I love that you just said because like
I play the fucking Banjo and violin and

1709
01:42:33,341 --> 01:42:34,660
people think we're a country band,

1710
01:42:34,661 --> 01:42:39,000
but we fucking rock like Ben plays the
electric guitar. It gets crazy and like,

1711
01:42:39,220 --> 01:42:42,970
but then we'll be sensitive.
And is it fair to say that you guys are,

1712
01:42:43,570 --> 01:42:47,690
because you're fair to say you guys
are a Donny and Marie for 2015 and Cho,

1713
01:42:47,770 --> 01:42:51,670
she's a little bit country. She's a little
bit, hold on, let me write that down.

1714
01:42:51,671 --> 01:42:54,410
That was a good fuck.
Come see you

1715
01:42:56,190 --> 01:42:58,050
could do is forced to them.

1716
01:42:59,960 --> 01:43:04,660
At first there were the
first fucking like, they were
kind of like a hybrid band.

1717
01:43:04,661 --> 01:43:08,310
They brother and sister though.
Mormon.

1718
01:43:09,580 --> 01:43:11,700
No, God, I'm so sorry

1719
01:43:14,320 --> 01:43:19,150
dude. From desert noises and
knock or his Roman. They are

1720
01:43:21,360 --> 01:43:25,960
on the hook. Me Jamie, pull up the,
the album of the Osman brothers.

1721
01:43:26,470 --> 01:43:30,670
Um, there was an Osman brothers album
where they did where they all showed their

1722
01:43:30,700 --> 01:43:34,180
planets that they have. Yeah,
yeah, yeah. When you die,

1723
01:43:34,181 --> 01:43:38,620
if you're a serious fucking hardcore
moment Mormon, you get your own planet.

1724
01:43:39,180 --> 01:43:43,020
Whoa. Oh, that's what's
up. We doing here. Why?

1725
01:43:43,570 --> 01:43:48,520
One of their albums is like them and
it shows like Mormon mythology on the

1726
01:43:48,521 --> 01:43:53,040
album, like planets and
shit. How does it go?

1727
01:43:53,060 --> 01:43:57,590
What that Jamie, it's a, you
get a planet when you die.

1728
01:43:57,920 --> 01:44:00,430
If I'm out of line, please. I need a five.

1729
01:44:00,440 --> 01:44:04,440
If I paraphrased pretty
sure the truth is coming.

1730
01:44:04,441 --> 01:44:05,930
Cause I remember somebody showed me to me,

1731
01:44:06,080 --> 01:44:09,860
it showed it to me and I almost blacked
out cause I always like, is this real?

1732
01:44:10,160 --> 01:44:12,590
I'm going to say something. I'm, you know
what, I'm not embarrassed about what?

1733
01:44:12,650 --> 01:44:17,630
I don't know. I couldn't name
a song. Maria. Oh, they had
a lot. And um, they were,

1734
01:44:17,631 --> 01:44:20,960
they were, they had a lot of hits. They're
very nice. But like Donnie especially,

1735
01:44:20,961 --> 01:44:24,650
it's like a really nice guy. He's
very friendly. He's like a super,

1736
01:44:24,651 --> 01:44:27,320
super like Nice,
easy going God that's awesome.

1737
01:44:27,321 --> 01:44:30,190
Like when you're around him and you know
like when I was a kid I used to watch

1738
01:44:30,191 --> 01:44:34,640
the, the Donny and Marie show on TV. So
I like to meet him in like real life.

1739
01:44:34,641 --> 01:44:39,110
I was like, is this real? Like I
totally didn't see a real like,

1740
01:44:39,190 --> 01:44:42,000
I mean Donny Osmond, I'm like, what is,

1741
01:44:42,260 --> 01:44:46,970
cannot really be Donny Osmond. There's
no way. I really hope after this we can,

1742
01:44:47,240 --> 01:44:50,860
this is a plan with Louis Marie.
This is,

1743
01:44:50,910 --> 01:44:54,620
it's called the plan apparently.
Which one from Seinfeld

1744
01:44:57,240 --> 01:45:01,120
where we,
we have some sort of an issue with our,

1745
01:45:01,600 --> 01:45:04,640
but did they have like a huge
radio hit? Yeah, they had,

1746
01:45:04,670 --> 01:45:07,970
well the Donny and Marie
had a big time show.

1747
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:11,810
They had a big television show.
So it was more about the show.

1748
01:45:13,330 --> 01:45:15,770
It was like a one night,
a week variety show.

1749
01:45:15,830 --> 01:45:20,830
If I had to remember like correctly
dig deep into my memory banks,

1750
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:25,700
but they would have like singers on
and they would sing. She would sing.

1751
01:45:25,701 --> 01:45:28,790
I'm a little bit contrary
and he would be like,

1752
01:45:30,680 --> 01:45:35,600
whoa, totally. Yeah. Like I
would have this thing. We're
kind of working together.

1753
01:45:35,610 --> 01:45:36,443
That's it,
dude.

1754
01:45:37,940 --> 01:45:42,230
I think it's the plan and this is the
inside of the album that has all sorts of

1755
01:45:42,231 --> 01:45:46,670
like going home with that hand.
Oh, the hand that holds the earth.

1756
01:45:46,671 --> 01:45:51,110
Is that what it is? Yeah, that's
the inside. Yeah. Hmm. Interesting.

1757
01:45:51,880 --> 01:45:55,820
Is that the home? But whatever it is,
that Mormon thing, whatever it is,

1758
01:45:55,821 --> 01:46:00,440
and made them, Made Donny Osmond
a very nice person. Very nice.

1759
01:46:00,500 --> 01:46:03,440
I mean that's kind of the stereotype.

1760
01:46:03,740 --> 01:46:07,850
I don't know if it matters.
Don't know if it matters.

1761
01:46:08,300 --> 01:46:11,780
I think in the end,
being, being a Nice Guy,

1762
01:46:11,781 --> 01:46:16,130
like Donny Osmond is more important
than knowing exactly how stars are made.

1763
01:46:19,700 --> 01:46:22,310
Knowing how planets are
formed in real life.

1764
01:46:22,340 --> 01:46:26,030
It doesn't really apply to the real world
because it's a super slow process and

1765
01:46:26,031 --> 01:46:29,420
if you dwell on that, you don't
have any time, there's no room.

1766
01:46:29,450 --> 01:46:33,700
You can't fit that in there. A
planetary question, can I ask you? Okay,

1767
01:46:33,710 --> 01:46:38,600
so I'm reading this book.
It's talking about all this
gas, all this matters. Boom,

1768
01:46:38,601 --> 01:46:42,890
colliding together and falling into
orbit of the sun and becoming this planet

1769
01:46:42,891 --> 01:46:46,130
that we're on. Right?
So why is there heat?

1770
01:46:46,180 --> 01:46:48,710
Why is there a ball of fucking
fire in the middle of it?

1771
01:46:48,740 --> 01:46:52,290
Where did super good question
from no idea. Me Neither.

1772
01:46:52,770 --> 01:46:57,160
I think it's like a fairy dust
and Leprechaun. Calm, loving

1773
01:46:59,340 --> 01:47:04,160
fairies and leprechauns each fuck a
separate tray and a calm Christ the death.

1774
01:47:04,370 --> 01:47:09,370
I'll take center of the Earth Texans to
change a light bulb because that one has

1775
01:47:10,650 --> 01:47:11,483
to watch the latter.

1776
01:47:13,170 --> 01:47:16,710
We don't lead light bulbs would
light candles around here.

1777
01:47:18,610 --> 01:47:23,370
Well, I have to go old school ride
horses, lot light candles, burning wax.

1778
01:47:23,400 --> 01:47:24,480
We drank whiskey

1779
01:47:26,220 --> 01:47:31,220
and we shoot and traders the dangerous
it can be really self aware worked.

1780
01:47:35,430 --> 01:47:40,310
This might be the most fucked up
we've ever been. Equally fucked us.

1781
01:47:40,770 --> 01:47:42,210
Last time I smoked weed and I was like,

1782
01:47:42,440 --> 01:47:43,840
Ooh,
you

1783
01:47:43,850 --> 01:47:48,490
just flat line for like when you smoke
me weed, it makes you introspective.

1784
01:47:48,970 --> 01:47:52,360
Um, I, it makes me, I'm an introvert,

1785
01:47:52,720 --> 01:47:57,190
a very introverted and uh, tired. Like,

1786
01:47:57,250 --> 01:48:01,930
I don't know. I'm not, I'm not
good at it, but also I'm not, but,

1787
01:48:02,080 --> 01:48:05,770
but it makes me sleep, which
is great because I have a
really hard time sleeping,

1788
01:48:05,960 --> 01:48:10,540
so I think that's something I have
them just like chemical reaction to it.

1789
01:48:11,170 --> 01:48:15,970
I've tried dude, I fuck you guys
are so good at it. You, you shine,

1790
01:48:16,240 --> 01:48:19,210
you really shine. Totally
understand where you're coming from.

1791
01:48:19,610 --> 01:48:22,090
You know who the fuck knows what it does.
I mean,

1792
01:48:23,050 --> 01:48:26,020
I know people that can't drink coffee.
Interesting. If they have a cup of coffee,

1793
01:48:26,021 --> 01:48:28,360
they feel like they're going to have
a heart attack. It just can't do it.

1794
01:48:28,450 --> 01:48:31,360
They just, for whatever reason,
coffee's really weird. Like I'll, I'll,

1795
01:48:32,200 --> 01:48:36,010
I'll have a cup and I will just like
peek and then I'll cry. Like if I,

1796
01:48:36,011 --> 01:48:40,420
if I have too much, I'll crash and they
get, they get really sad. But, but,

1797
01:48:40,540 --> 01:48:43,810
but like for like the two hours, I'm just
super productive like emails and shit.

1798
01:48:43,990 --> 01:48:46,570
Everybody does that. Are you
making fun of me? No, no, no, no.

1799
01:48:46,960 --> 01:48:50,110
If I knew how to put you in a
headlock, I would, but I think

1800
01:48:52,240 --> 01:48:55,360
that's the one that you do like a karate
chop. How do you protect the nose?

1801
01:48:55,530 --> 01:48:58,990
Put the turn your the back of the
hand towards the back of the head. No,

1802
01:48:58,991 --> 01:49:03,640
the other way. His head. You're choking.
Spin your hand like a left. Pinky down.

1803
01:49:04,080 --> 01:49:07,030
Pinky down. Keep going. Keep going.
Keep going. That make like karate.

1804
01:49:07,031 --> 01:49:09,870
Chop your hand. Make me cry.
Chop thing like you would cry.

1805
01:49:09,871 --> 01:49:11,430
Chop like straight hand right now.

1806
01:49:11,470 --> 01:49:15,580
That's what you're sneaking behind their
neck and then you squeeze down on that.

1807
01:49:16,510 --> 01:49:21,460
That's how you do it. I can fucking do
this. The hand on the back of the neck,

1808
01:49:21,700 --> 01:49:25,840
it goes into like a karate chop position
like this and what that does is gives

1809
01:49:25,841 --> 01:49:27,430
you maximum leverage.

1810
01:49:30,960 --> 01:49:35,950
If you do get under someone's arm,
you could totally choke a guy out asleep.

1811
01:49:36,030 --> 01:49:38,260
Hundred percent. God.
There's a lot of women,

1812
01:49:38,500 --> 01:49:42,070
like if it came to the difference between
like a woman who's like a kickboxer,

1813
01:49:42,250 --> 01:49:43,510
a defending herself.

1814
01:49:43,540 --> 01:49:47,860
It was the same amount of experience in
the gym as a woman who's a Jujitsu black

1815
01:49:47,861 --> 01:49:48,250
belt

1816
01:49:48,250 --> 01:49:52,720
defending herself. It would
be on my, um, in my opinion,

1817
01:49:52,750 --> 01:49:57,750
I would favor the woman like her ability
to dominate a much larger opponent

1818
01:49:59,140 --> 01:50:02,860
using only Jujitsu skills over,
uh, especially for women I think.

1819
01:50:03,310 --> 01:50:08,200
I think because Jiu Jitsu is the most
technical and the most a positional and

1820
01:50:08,201 --> 01:50:13,000
leverage based of all the martial
arts and it's sorta like I attributed,

1821
01:50:13,030 --> 01:50:14,720
I um,
uh,

1822
01:50:15,730 --> 01:50:18,580
compare it to like getting in an argument
with someone who doesn't know English

1823
01:50:18,581 --> 01:50:19,300
very well.

1824
01:50:19,300 --> 01:50:22,690
I'll give you were having an argument
with someone and they were like really

1825
01:50:22,691 --> 01:50:25,330
shitty at English and then we're
just slowly, you'd be like,

1826
01:50:25,370 --> 01:50:28,780
what the fuck are you talking
about, dummy? What'd you
say? Spit it out. Stupid.

1827
01:50:28,960 --> 01:50:31,950
Like it was a mean person.
You know yourself, right?

1828
01:50:32,100 --> 01:50:34,300
Well that's the same way with Jujitsu.

1829
01:50:34,510 --> 01:50:39,370
Like if you knew that the language of
you Jitsu so well and you had some dumb

1830
01:50:39,371 --> 01:50:42,310
dude that was trying to grab you,
you'd be like, yeah, fuck you.

1831
01:50:43,980 --> 01:50:47,470
They're like, you'd be like some crazy
Ninja chick on his back choking him.

1832
01:50:48,200 --> 01:50:52,230
Absolutely feasible. Whereas like with
striking, the real problem with that,

1833
01:50:52,250 --> 01:50:55,700
a lot of women phases,
the actual physical size of their bones,

1834
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:59,060
like when you're punching her,
especially like unless you,

1835
01:50:59,061 --> 01:51:01,910
you have your hands fully
wrapped up like an, you know,

1836
01:51:01,911 --> 01:51:05,930
a good boxing wrap and then a
padded leather glove on top of that.

1837
01:51:06,200 --> 01:51:09,280
It's hard to just punch people
in the face if you're well,

1838
01:51:09,290 --> 01:51:13,670
unless you have a good sturdy jilled.
We're not like in a,

1839
01:51:13,970 --> 01:51:17,510
I'm not like in a position where I'm going
to have an actual battle with someone

1840
01:51:17,660 --> 01:51:20,060
yet you don't really know. I don't
know. You're right, but, but,

1841
01:51:20,061 --> 01:51:22,340
but at the end you want
to do it for competition.

1842
01:51:22,380 --> 01:51:25,700
You want to do it for self defense
defense. I mean like I would like to see,

1843
01:51:25,701 --> 01:51:30,701
then you can't say that because that
could happen on the way to the grocery

1844
01:51:30,771 --> 01:51:33,980
store. Oh my God. You run into
some crazy messed up chicks.

1845
01:51:34,820 --> 01:51:39,080
Do you get out? Literally
there's, there's something,

1846
01:51:39,750 --> 01:51:43,500
we're like, we're doing this. I
wish I had the fucking man power.

1847
01:51:43,501 --> 01:51:48,501
Literally to like we were in Nashville
like two weeks ago for Americana Fest.

1848
01:51:48,770 --> 01:51:51,840
We were playing this festival and we
were driving under this bridge and there

1849
01:51:51,841 --> 01:51:55,560
were these two guys beating the fuck
out of each other in the middle of the

1850
01:51:55,561 --> 01:51:57,710
street.
It was like a bottle over the face.

1851
01:51:57,711 --> 01:52:01,530
This one guy was choking the other guy
who tank or no, no. Hey look, terrible.

1852
01:52:01,531 --> 01:52:05,670
It was sloppy. It was sloppy. It
was sloppy. Crackhead bullshit.

1853
01:52:05,780 --> 01:52:09,210
It's one of the main puzzles but he was,
it was like,

1854
01:52:09,420 --> 01:52:12,420
obviously we called the police but like I,
I had this moment where I was like,

1855
01:52:12,750 --> 01:52:15,090
I wanted to do something. I'm
like, what the fuck can I do?

1856
01:52:15,091 --> 01:52:18,110
And I literally don't lean out the
window and I went stop at stop.

1857
01:52:19,440 --> 01:52:23,160
I didn't know what to do and I called
the police. But like if I were a new job,

1858
01:52:23,170 --> 01:52:28,140
like I would have definitely stayed
in my car. Right. Hundred percent

1859
01:52:29,640 --> 01:52:31,050
to me.
Listen to me,

1860
01:52:31,051 --> 01:52:35,190
if you fucking have your driving by
two people beating the fuck out of each

1861
01:52:35,191 --> 01:52:39,440
other, you are not there. Okay. You,

1862
01:52:40,740 --> 01:52:43,770
you were in a car.
Just because it's right in front of you.

1863
01:52:43,771 --> 01:52:47,570
That shit could be a hundred
miles in less and less.

1864
01:52:47,600 --> 01:52:51,200
There's someone in that
mixture that needs you.

1865
01:52:51,230 --> 01:52:55,070
Like if there's someone who's small and
they're getting beaten up by someone big,

1866
01:52:55,071 --> 01:52:57,830
then everything changes.
But if it's too fucking dudes you buy,

1867
01:53:02,660 --> 01:53:04,070
they're fighting this tree.

1868
01:53:05,640 --> 01:53:10,130
So my point is don't always stock,
just kiss already. Don't always stop.

1869
01:53:10,460 --> 01:53:12,780
Sometimes you gotta let two
dudes beat each of the day.

1870
01:53:14,030 --> 01:53:18,440
It's better for everybody.
Certain people, it's fine.

1871
01:53:18,560 --> 01:53:21,230
Just give them both rocks and
push them near the edge. Go

1872
01:53:23,600 --> 01:53:27,080
let them fall. Anything I do, I'm
going to stay and keep coal mining.

1873
01:53:27,200 --> 01:53:30,260
You got to keep moving.
Okay. Genes need to flourish.

1874
01:53:30,470 --> 01:53:35,270
They need to find better streams of of
diversity. I appreciate the [inaudible].

1875
01:53:35,730 --> 01:53:39,080
That's what I'm saying, man,
don't always stop fights,

1876
01:53:39,320 --> 01:53:42,080
but some fights you have
to stop. Right? Right.

1877
01:53:42,081 --> 01:53:46,040
The classic is a man beating
a woman, man. Being a woman.

1878
01:53:46,280 --> 01:53:49,820
There's a small battle in the front row
of the honey honey show the other day in

1879
01:53:49,821 --> 01:53:51,830
Long Beach. I don't like that.
I don't like that either,

1880
01:53:51,831 --> 01:53:53,600
but I also think it's amazing people

1881
01:53:55,260 --> 01:53:57,050
fucking look guys,
guys,

1882
01:53:57,320 --> 01:54:02,320
come on guys hug each other this
summer that we're fucking hardcore,

1883
01:54:03,261 --> 01:54:07,800
but also we're fucking lovers and like it
was like, it was amazing to have these,

1884
01:54:07,880 --> 01:54:11,330
these dudes were fighting and he was like,
fuck you mother fucker. And I was like,

1885
01:54:11,331 --> 01:54:15,410
guys, one of you as a honey honey
tee shirt. I just want to be like,

1886
01:54:15,970 --> 01:54:18,890
let's think about this for a second.
Here's her.

1887
01:54:19,130 --> 01:54:21,260
I hate that expression pro tip.

1888
01:54:22,790 --> 01:54:25,800
Whenever someone tells you that
they're hardcore, they're never harder.

1889
01:54:26,750 --> 01:54:31,520
That's 100% and like the expression,
we're hardcore,

1890
01:54:32,090 --> 01:54:35,410
but that never comes out of the mouth.
But Joe

1891
01:54:39,670 --> 01:54:42,900
just as hardcore,
no,

1892
01:54:44,600 --> 01:54:48,350
we'll never claim hardcore. I've never
claimed hardcore. I don't say it.

1893
01:54:48,740 --> 01:54:52,070
I'm more of like a medium core.
I'm balanced.

1894
01:54:52,160 --> 01:54:54,500
I'm all about longevity,
balance,

1895
01:54:55,610 --> 01:54:59,870
constant assessment of the path
and don't try to run the furthest.

1896
01:54:59,871 --> 01:55:03,860
Try to make sure you hit the least
trees. Nice. That's how I look at it.

1897
01:55:04,060 --> 01:55:05,210
I think it's like super.

1898
01:55:05,560 --> 01:55:10,280
It's super important to
evaluate the next few steps.

1899
01:55:10,760 --> 01:55:14,390
Well, I think there's a lot of
fucking continuing the same patterns.

1900
01:55:14,630 --> 01:55:18,950
They've got people into the positions
we're in now. A lot of flailing.

1901
01:55:19,670 --> 01:55:22,100
That's a great word too.
Perfect for it.

1902
01:55:22,340 --> 01:55:27,260
It sounds like what it looks
like flailing. No, it's true.

1903
01:55:27,280 --> 01:55:30,590
Right? Flailing. It's like one of
the best words ever. Descriptively.

1904
01:55:31,100 --> 01:55:35,980
That's a good one.
You fucking spastic a Taylor.

1905
01:55:37,280 --> 01:55:40,840
Damn, you got them right within us.

1906
01:55:40,950 --> 01:55:45,060
I take them down core, bro. You're
a flailing dude. You're flailing.

1907
01:55:45,880 --> 01:55:50,640
You just running, flailing
any crumble and they're like,

1908
01:55:50,641 --> 01:55:52,140
you're right.
I know.

1909
01:55:52,170 --> 01:55:56,640
It's definitely a word that like forces
you into a bad position, you know?

1910
01:55:56,970 --> 01:56:01,290
Sure. It's there. I
think that's how you, Oh,

1911
01:56:01,291 --> 01:56:04,320
you've got your footing. It's like
you're fucking falling out of control.

1912
01:56:04,350 --> 01:56:09,090
Let me hold you. I think conversations,
conversations are in a lot,

1913
01:56:09,360 --> 01:56:12,750
a lot of ways to like numerical exchanges.
Like you know,

1914
01:56:12,751 --> 01:56:16,800
you say something that's 30 and she goes,
oh this bitch wants to get crazy.

1915
01:56:16,801 --> 01:56:20,970
And she says something that's 37 and
then you might just rash here right up to

1916
01:56:20,971 --> 01:56:25,971
90 what in the 42 and 1670 but if we
take away the cultural context of the

1917
01:56:29,821 --> 01:56:32,510
words, she calls me and cut, my mother
told me, don't ever leave her crawl.

1918
01:56:32,520 --> 01:56:33,450
You will fucking cunt.

1919
01:56:33,690 --> 01:56:36,840
But girl cause you can't you stab
you stab her in front of your mother.

1920
01:56:36,990 --> 01:56:40,490
It's fucking to the death tax.
Conchas a big word but,

1921
01:56:40,710 --> 01:56:42,780
but what are those things?
What are those moments?

1922
01:56:42,781 --> 01:56:47,520
Well those really take away the cultural
contexts. There's a numerical value to,

1923
01:56:47,580 --> 01:56:50,890
to the expression like the
girl hit you with a 90 bomb.

1924
01:56:54,550 --> 01:56:59,070
Oh No,
that bitch tried to cut to the bone.

1925
01:56:59,160 --> 01:57:04,050
She tries to go through your own
emotions to get into your fucking nervous

1926
01:57:04,051 --> 01:57:05,990
system and start chiseling in their

1927
01:57:07,500 --> 01:57:11,100
fucking the PD that they occasionally,

1928
01:57:11,960 --> 01:57:13,470
but I think it's,
that's what it is.

1929
01:57:14,130 --> 01:57:17,970
If you look at it and not in terms of
like a conversation between two people

1930
01:57:17,971 --> 01:57:19,200
that are being mean to each other,

1931
01:57:19,520 --> 01:57:23,180
like w w throw all that stuff
away throughout all the, the, the,

1932
01:57:23,400 --> 01:57:27,090
the cultural framework that we have.
What are you watching? A number exchange.

1933
01:57:27,630 --> 01:57:31,740
You're watching people play in a
sound exchange to, you know, to keep,

1934
01:57:31,741 --> 01:57:35,640
I keep trying to fucking get it to sound.
It's a competition. It's a competition.

1935
01:57:36,030 --> 01:57:36,340
There's that,

1936
01:57:36,340 --> 01:57:39,560
there's a social competition involved
and people being mean to each other. Oh,

1937
01:57:40,290 --> 01:57:42,960
I really think that's what a lot
when when people's like, you know,

1938
01:57:42,961 --> 01:57:46,800
someone hits you with a 32 and you hit
him with a fucking 40 you know, like Whoa,

1939
01:57:46,801 --> 01:57:50,610
I walked away on a 40 you know,
and I was going to fucking keep going.

1940
01:57:50,610 --> 01:57:55,290
But so a nice clean kill,
there's a competition.

1941
01:57:55,291 --> 01:57:57,840
You'll go back to the water cooler.
You talk about it.

1942
01:57:58,050 --> 01:58:00,270
This fucking guy comes
up to me and he says,

1943
01:58:00,271 --> 01:58:02,910
well one day maybe you'll
be a manager to my pitch.

1944
01:58:02,911 --> 01:58:05,970
You don't think I know your fucking dad
owns the company or are you out of your

1945
01:58:05,971 --> 01:58:09,400
mind? If you want to live in
Milan, what are you talking about?

1946
01:58:09,420 --> 01:58:11,040
That he'll shut the door,
the lock,

1947
01:58:11,041 --> 01:58:13,610
the fucking lunch room and they'll
have these deep conversations.

1948
01:58:13,630 --> 01:58:16,140
I told this mother Fucker,
if your dad didn't on this company,

1949
01:58:16,350 --> 01:58:18,540
you'd be buried under my house.

1950
01:58:21,160 --> 01:58:23,280
People do. So they go through
them. But what are they doing?

1951
01:58:23,310 --> 01:58:25,290
Their number exchanging.
That's what they're doing.

1952
01:58:25,360 --> 01:58:29,790
They're to just try to win some
stupid social dominance. But then we,

1953
01:58:29,800 --> 01:58:34,060
we're okay with it's all
dynamic. Real what you, where

1954
01:58:36,560 --> 01:58:39,120
we had a big fight like last week,

1955
01:58:41,110 --> 01:58:42,660
took a long walk down,

1956
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:46,840
thought I was going to take the train
to the next city and need me to travel

1957
01:58:46,841 --> 01:58:49,330
with it. You know, do
it. We'll go to Africa.

1958
01:58:49,690 --> 01:58:52,790
Can I be honest with you
about something? Um, this

1959
01:58:56,580 --> 01:59:00,520
is fucking you guys following me around

1960
01:59:04,420 --> 01:59:07,800
because I hate, you know, but it's,
it's true. You know, it's something,

1961
01:59:07,840 --> 01:59:12,150
the numbers game, I have a
temper for sure. You know,

1962
01:59:12,340 --> 01:59:16,210
and um, some triggers as to you,
you know, but we all have tempers.

1963
01:59:16,211 --> 01:59:17,490
It just takes different things.

1964
01:59:18,170 --> 01:59:23,170
The main maintenance of this band that
we're in requires a certain frequency.

1965
01:59:24,070 --> 01:59:28,330
You're fucking favorite word today.
Um, that if we don't, if we don't,

1966
01:59:28,900 --> 01:59:30,580
if we don't exist in that,

1967
01:59:30,850 --> 01:59:34,210
there can be an imbalance and then it
can build into this fight and then we'll

1968
01:59:34,211 --> 01:59:37,180
fucking fight. Cause we're in
a fucking band. But, but like,

1969
01:59:37,540 --> 01:59:41,470
cause we were two people that spent so
much time together and go through all

1970
01:59:41,471 --> 01:59:42,640
these incredible experiences,

1971
01:59:42,641 --> 01:59:45,490
but there's a certain finish
each other's sandwiches.

1972
01:59:45,880 --> 01:59:50,470
There's the stress that comes along
with it. You know what I mean? Dude,

1973
01:59:50,570 --> 01:59:53,500
you're traveling, you're doing
shows or just live in whatever.

1974
01:59:53,530 --> 01:59:57,700
But my relationship with the comedians
that I work with is less intimate because

1975
01:59:57,701 --> 01:59:59,980
we don't share us. We very, very, very,

1976
01:59:59,981 --> 02:00:03,220
very rarely share a
stage at the same time.

1977
02:00:03,730 --> 02:00:07,070
And we don't have to practice
together. And we, you know, it's,

1978
02:00:07,071 --> 02:00:09,570
it's a totally different experience
I think cause it's a, it's an,

1979
02:00:09,580 --> 02:00:10,540
it's like you guys,

1980
02:00:10,690 --> 02:00:13,920
if you have a bunch of friends that
you consistently tour with, you know,

1981
02:00:14,020 --> 02:00:18,490
that were nodding your band.
Like it's very talk about numbers.

1982
02:00:18,540 --> 02:00:22,000
I'm having the right combination
of people in cause we're in a,

1983
02:00:22,120 --> 02:00:27,120
we're in a a used Cadillac Escalade
2007 this is all good romance novels and

1984
02:00:29,860 --> 02:00:33,250
there's room for about four
people save for a girlfriend.

1985
02:00:33,251 --> 02:00:36,540
Every once in a while our drummers
girlfriend comes out or possibly are.

1986
02:00:36,900 --> 02:00:41,800
I know she's great. She's very sweet. Joe.

1987
02:00:41,801 --> 02:00:43,090
Joe,
don't do that.

1988
02:00:45,790 --> 02:00:50,150
I'm sure you're a wonderful person. If
you're listening, not talking about, oh,

1989
02:00:50,950 --> 02:00:53,230
I couldn't possibly be talking about you.
I don't know you.

1990
02:00:53,231 --> 02:00:56,820
And they haven't said nothing wrong.
Covered.

1991
02:00:58,420 --> 02:01:03,120
You have this like combination
of personal space and then

1992
02:01:07,030 --> 02:01:09,560
she's trying to read my text.

1993
02:01:13,480 --> 02:01:18,130
This is my side of the bus. You wouldn't
even be here if you want honey, honey.

1994
02:01:19,500 --> 02:01:22,000
She jokes. I'm just joking. No,

1995
02:01:22,001 --> 02:01:24,800
but it's funny because like we fucking,

1996
02:01:25,210 --> 02:01:29,020
we will fight and then we'll have these
great experiences. Like where were you?

1997
02:01:29,021 --> 02:01:33,580
Just you, you have to like work
your, it's like we're all married.

1998
02:01:33,700 --> 02:01:35,030
Everyone in the band.
You know,

1999
02:01:35,031 --> 02:01:39,470
it's like you spent so much time together
to this point where like I know by the

2000
02:01:39,471 --> 02:01:40,510
way that Ben Breathe

2001
02:01:40,510 --> 02:01:45,470
sometimes that like, oh he's,
he's really fucking mad,

2002
02:01:45,500 --> 02:01:50,000
or he needs a sandwich. Or like
creating drama with your fake psychic

2003
02:01:50,080 --> 02:01:52,600
powers of psyche,

2004
02:01:54,540 --> 02:01:58,110
psyche,
please,

2005
02:01:59,220 --> 02:02:04,000
please, please listen, please. You
guys need more people to bounce off of.

2006
02:02:04,260 --> 02:02:06,800
You need to get annoyed at
me every now and then. Tell

2007
02:02:06,800 --> 02:02:11,760
him that fucking guy to just turn it off.
Turn it off. No more jokes, no more fun.

2008
02:02:11,780 --> 02:02:13,490
We have good dosing.
You know what I mean?

2009
02:02:13,491 --> 02:02:15,140
We see each other every couple of months.

2010
02:02:15,200 --> 02:02:18,800
I honestly think it's lucky meatloaf
every day when you're with the same person

2011
02:02:18,801 --> 02:02:20,870
every day,
like you want to meet new people and do,

2012
02:02:20,871 --> 02:02:24,590
but you guys are achieving something
that you couldn't achieve if you just in

2013
02:02:24,591 --> 02:02:27,590
this like crazy life where
you went one way and you do.

2014
02:02:28,010 --> 02:02:31,190
You guys got this weird thing going
on because you have this weird,

2015
02:02:31,700 --> 02:02:35,060
you have this,
you have this artistic synergy.

2016
02:02:35,061 --> 02:02:38,760
I would say in that like you're
both very different, but you,

2017
02:02:38,761 --> 02:02:42,440
you were also very, you're,
you're very cool to each other.

2018
02:02:42,680 --> 02:02:44,240
Like as much as you guys get in fights,

2019
02:02:44,241 --> 02:02:45,590
like when you guys are nice to each other,

2020
02:02:45,770 --> 02:02:48,040
like I can see like when you
guys interact that you're,

2021
02:02:48,240 --> 02:02:51,260
you genuinely love each other
and you genuinely friends.

2022
02:02:51,260 --> 02:02:53,260
And if you do say something
a little mean every,

2023
02:02:53,450 --> 02:02:58,450
occasionally you're genuinely sorry and
you genuinely care and love about it.

2024
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:00,980
You love each other.
So when you guys do,

2025
02:03:01,180 --> 02:03:04,610
it comes out that comes out in your music.
You guys aren't you,

2026
02:03:04,710 --> 02:03:08,480
you're not day players on a fucking
sitcoms pretended to be in love with each

2027
02:03:08,481 --> 02:03:10,040
other. You know what I'm saying? I mean,

2028
02:03:10,041 --> 02:03:13,760
you guys aren't like a fucking guys
that studio musicians, they brought it,

2029
02:03:13,761 --> 02:03:16,040
never met each other and they're
going to lay down a track.

2030
02:03:16,070 --> 02:03:18,710
Now you guys have been doing
this and you have like this,

2031
02:03:19,040 --> 02:03:23,870
this thing you're doing together. You
know, this, this, this. You're all,

2032
02:03:23,900 --> 02:03:28,390
you have to deal with the fact that you're
so intimate with each other like you,

2033
02:03:28,391 --> 02:03:31,430
you, you're going to annoy the fuck
out of each other. You are each other.

2034
02:03:31,850 --> 02:03:36,170
I mean you guys are fucked up.
You can totally numb with your lives.

2035
02:03:36,171 --> 02:03:38,270
If it gets too crazy,
you totally could,

2036
02:03:38,390 --> 02:03:42,020
but right now you can't cause right
now you're like almost one person.

2037
02:03:43,580 --> 02:03:47,120
You guys are almost like one like
really well spread out person.

2038
02:03:47,600 --> 02:03:51,110
You just saved me so much money
in therapy. I can't even tell you.

2039
02:03:51,740 --> 02:03:55,340
I'm glad because I can't afford it.
It's too good.

2040
02:03:55,850 --> 02:03:58,880
It's still good together because
you're too good together.

2041
02:03:58,881 --> 02:04:02,270
It wouldn't work like that with other
people. It's, it would be different.

2042
02:04:02,450 --> 02:04:05,450
It would probably be equally
awesome for both of you,

2043
02:04:05,690 --> 02:04:10,190
but don't let it happen because what you
guys have right now, you've hit this,

2044
02:04:10,220 --> 02:04:11,570
whatever this thing is,

2045
02:04:11,571 --> 02:04:16,571
you've got this ball of focus
and experience and musical
knowledge and love and

2046
02:04:19,401 --> 02:04:23,480
it's all coming together with your own
specific creativity and you guys are just

2047
02:04:24,100 --> 02:04:27,890
in, you're putting out these songs that
are like, Whoa, like they're not there.

2048
02:04:28,010 --> 02:04:30,830
They keep getting better, like your,
your shit keeps getting better.

2049
02:04:30,980 --> 02:04:34,760
Like you have your old stuff was awesome
and then you new stuff like grows and

2050
02:04:34,761 --> 02:04:39,150
some of you putting layers on these
things. So look, you got to be friends,

2051
02:04:39,900 --> 02:04:44,900
do ecstasy every few months past the
move and every like eight or nine months,

2052
02:04:46,201 --> 02:04:50,160
just set a weekend aside where no one
is going to touch their cell phone.

2053
02:04:50,161 --> 02:04:54,810
Just do a little Molly. It sounds
like you're joking, but honestly,

2054
02:04:55,850 --> 02:05:00,610
really beautiful things and, and it's,
it's something that, uh, is nice to hear.

2055
02:05:00,630 --> 02:05:04,730
Thank you for saying that. You know,
it's a weird life. We live in jazz.

2056
02:05:04,731 --> 02:05:09,290
It's fuck is a lot of instability
and you know, but like we,

2057
02:05:09,410 --> 02:05:10,540
it's funny like when we fight,

2058
02:05:10,541 --> 02:05:14,120
when we go to our separate corners and
if it lasts a while, like it's weird,

2059
02:05:14,450 --> 02:05:19,070
there's like a real darkness, but it's
weird. But it's also part of our dynamic,

2060
02:05:19,071 --> 02:05:21,740
you know? And it's, I think that's part
of all what you're saying. You know,

2061
02:05:22,460 --> 02:05:24,280
you can't exclude certain parts of it.
Yeah.

2062
02:05:24,370 --> 02:05:27,340
And if you guys had some sort
of a specific relationship,

2063
02:05:27,341 --> 02:05:31,400
like if you are brother and
sister or be so many houses,

2064
02:05:31,470 --> 02:05:32,440
same parents,

2065
02:05:32,620 --> 02:05:37,120
those parents fostered and they
created us and now we were children.

2066
02:05:37,121 --> 02:05:41,200
And this is this our, this is my
cousin, this is my cousin Ben. Yeah,

2067
02:05:41,201 --> 02:05:46,000
here's a mom who's my brother, sister.
And that's why we're friends, you know?

2068
02:05:46,001 --> 02:05:50,320
But when your family with someone
who you're not really family with,

2069
02:05:50,350 --> 02:05:54,850
like I'm family with a lot of people
and not all of them are related to me.

2070
02:05:55,210 --> 02:05:59,560
I'm family with a giant group of people.
You guys are clearly family.

2071
02:05:59,890 --> 02:06:04,240
You guys are family. So whatever
happens, like you have to,

2072
02:06:04,420 --> 02:06:06,580
you have to hear, you're always going to
have to deal with that. It's just not,

2073
02:06:06,581 --> 02:06:10,450
it's not find, you know what I'm
saying? Yeah. P. Dot. Husband and wife,

2074
02:06:10,451 --> 02:06:12,760
you're not mother and son.
You know, it's, it's weird.

2075
02:06:12,761 --> 02:06:14,950
You're not father and daughter.
You're not brothers.

2076
02:06:14,951 --> 02:06:18,090
What's the noise I need to make
with my face? That means you got,

2077
02:06:19,090 --> 02:06:21,910
and if you don't have that noise,
oh, you guys aren't married. Well,

2078
02:06:21,911 --> 02:06:24,460
how do you think he's ever going to
come in? You know like those fucking,

2079
02:06:24,490 --> 02:06:27,850
the people go through that kind of shit
and relationships with like just what,

2080
02:06:27,851 --> 02:06:29,980
what noise do I have to make the changes?

2081
02:06:29,981 --> 02:06:32,650
Your perception of what this
is cause what we have to,

2082
02:06:32,651 --> 02:06:35,170
it has to be defined
and then what the fuck?

2083
02:06:35,640 --> 02:06:40,150
What's the definition of a band of really,
really close friends?

2084
02:06:40,420 --> 02:06:43,150
They make awesome music together.
What does that, what does that,

2085
02:06:43,180 --> 02:06:48,170
what does that do you guys to wizards?
Wizards. Plague it. What the fuck are you,

2086
02:06:49,590 --> 02:06:51,760
you travel all across the
country together. Okay.

2087
02:06:51,790 --> 02:06:56,120
What do I call you when I call you guys
or you guys? Accountants. Gandalf gains.

2088
02:06:56,140 --> 02:06:58,840
Are you married? Is it
a mister and missus? No.

2089
02:06:59,170 --> 02:07:03,760
Is it a non gender specific designation
of some sort of Congrat contractual

2090
02:07:03,761 --> 02:07:07,360
agreement? Like what is it? What is
it? Oh, we're just in the van together.

2091
02:07:07,510 --> 02:07:10,660
We love each other.
What the fuck is this like angel,

2092
02:07:10,661 --> 02:07:13,390
man that came into our lives or something.
I don't fucking know.

2093
02:07:13,600 --> 02:07:14,680
And you guys to me,

2094
02:07:15,040 --> 02:07:18,460
I remember when the first time I watched
your video when you guys did that angel

2095
02:07:18,461 --> 02:07:21,970
of Death Acoustic version on the roof.
I was like Whoa.

2096
02:07:22,770 --> 02:07:26,410
A while ago. We wouldn't know each other
a long time. Now who's the dude's name?

2097
02:07:26,411 --> 02:07:30,230
It was a crazy name that told me about
it on the Internet. Balls of steel

2098
02:07:32,290 --> 02:07:34,680
still. We don't know who that is. He knows

2099
02:07:36,510 --> 02:07:41,290
superhero who has this knowledge.
He's definitely love.

2100
02:07:41,620 --> 02:07:43,030
I've had a few people,
you know,

2101
02:07:43,031 --> 02:07:46,330
it's one of the cooler things about being
connected to people on social media.

2102
02:07:46,330 --> 02:07:46,580
They'll,

2103
02:07:46,580 --> 02:07:49,240
they'll connect you with something that
you probably never would have heard of

2104
02:07:49,241 --> 02:07:53,800
before. It's amazing. And
then just for you guys,

2105
02:07:53,801 --> 02:07:58,270
we became friends, you know,
in a strange way. So that's
it. Yeah, it's been amazing,

2106
02:07:58,271 --> 02:08:01,720
man. We are headed, coldly
changed. Um, our band honestly,

2107
02:08:01,721 --> 02:08:06,720
like it changed us from being a, we can
throw the country now honestly, and it's,

2108
02:08:06,760 --> 02:08:09,430
this has been a huge
part of it. Huge. Wow.

2109
02:08:09,940 --> 02:08:13,660
This is the way I look at
like all podcasts. Honestly.

2110
02:08:13,900 --> 02:08:18,900
It's like the idea of taking credit for
the ocean when you accidentally stumbled

2111
02:08:19,751 --> 02:08:23,590
upon an opening that turned something
into a river. Like that's what,

2112
02:08:23,610 --> 02:08:24,130
that's what I get.

2113
02:08:24,130 --> 02:08:28,690
All everything that everybody extracts
out of what they find on the Internet is

2114
02:08:28,700 --> 02:08:31,210
essentially like you found a path,
he hit a button,

2115
02:08:31,211 --> 02:08:34,900
you pull the lever and a river
open. You know, there's a ribbon,

2116
02:08:34,920 --> 02:08:38,380
a river of honey honey songs
or Sturgill Simpson or,

2117
02:08:38,710 --> 02:08:41,320
or Tom Segora or Joey Diaz.

2118
02:08:41,650 --> 02:08:45,940
You're like some guys trying to take
credit for the ocean because you figured

2119
02:08:45,941 --> 02:08:48,850
out this, if you hit this
switch, it opens it in the river,

2120
02:08:48,851 --> 02:08:52,660
just runs into the villages and then
everybody finds out about Duncan Trussell

2121
02:08:53,560 --> 02:08:56,140
keep hitting these switches and like,

2122
02:08:56,141 --> 02:08:59,030
so I can't take any credit for it.
Oh,

2123
02:08:59,040 --> 02:09:03,930
all I did was stumble upon some,
some switching station for all these uh,

2124
02:09:03,970 --> 02:09:06,640
like super talented people. Yeah.
That's how I look at it. Yeah.

2125
02:09:06,700 --> 02:09:09,190
But it's a cool thing that you're
looking for switching stations.

2126
02:09:09,220 --> 02:09:13,690
Not even though I think it's what's fucked
up movie. Yes and no. You totally are

2127
02:09:14,800 --> 02:09:17,560
pretty pertinent purpose for
where we're at right now.

2128
02:09:17,561 --> 02:09:20,830
It's pretty cool and it's really
great to witness the effort,

2129
02:09:20,860 --> 02:09:25,240
the effects of what you do and at the
switching station when we're out on the

2130
02:09:25,241 --> 02:09:27,070
road and all these incredible,

2131
02:09:27,130 --> 02:09:32,130
incredible fucking people that come out
that like just love you and and really

2132
02:09:32,861 --> 02:09:35,940
learn from the things that you say.
You know

2133
02:09:36,240 --> 02:09:37,200
they love you guys too.

2134
02:09:37,201 --> 02:09:40,140
So many had the flower honey honey shirt
at one of my shows you the night the

2135
02:09:40,141 --> 02:09:43,330
grandma flower. I have
that tattooed. It's a duo.

2136
02:09:43,930 --> 02:09:47,340
Shazamm you want me to dues? We're
going to freeze frame that and jerk off.

2137
02:09:47,670 --> 02:09:52,210
That's fucked. No time. Let's just
move on how it works. No worries.

2138
02:09:52,300 --> 02:09:55,800
You feel funny but kind of in a good way.
No,

2139
02:09:55,890 --> 02:10:00,360
I haven't decided to make a good
connection with the nice people online.

2140
02:10:00,390 --> 02:10:05,250
It's like one of the most promising like
hints at what's possible for the future.

2141
02:10:05,251 --> 02:10:10,251
Like there's this idea that because
online is anonymous and anonymous means

2142
02:10:10,291 --> 02:10:12,750
you're always going to be mean.
That's not the case.

2143
02:10:12,810 --> 02:10:15,840
Like you're always going to get a certain
amount of people that are shitheads.

2144
02:10:16,260 --> 02:10:19,200
But those people, quite
honestly, almost all of them,

2145
02:10:19,201 --> 02:10:23,910
they're damaged and hurt people who got
fucked over in life and then they try to

2146
02:10:23,911 --> 02:10:28,350
take out all that
on all these other people.

2147
02:10:28,380 --> 02:10:30,690
I mean that's the vast
majority of what's going on.

2148
02:10:30,990 --> 02:10:35,990
But the amount of noise per
capita is so high amongst cunts.

2149
02:10:36,470 --> 02:10:40,460
It's hot so hard.
Cause most people don't post anything.

2150
02:10:40,730 --> 02:10:42,410
Most people would think
you guys are awesome.

2151
02:10:42,411 --> 02:10:44,630
We've listened to his podcast
who've listened to your song.

2152
02:10:44,631 --> 02:10:47,720
If they don't say a word about it, they
don't tweet about it. They don't. They'll,

2153
02:10:47,721 --> 02:10:50,810
they'll come up to me at shows
and I'll just tell me, oh my God,

2154
02:10:50,811 --> 02:10:54,440
thank you guys for introducing
me to honey, honey. Oh,
all the time. All the time.

2155
02:10:54,680 --> 02:10:57,830
All the time. Awesome. They don't
say, they don't ever say, you know,

2156
02:10:57,831 --> 02:11:01,520
I tweet about them all the time.
No, the people that are too sweet,

2157
02:11:01,890 --> 02:11:03,200
they'll say like mean shit.

2158
02:11:05,390 --> 02:11:06,730
Well, you know, it's a free,

2159
02:11:07,270 --> 02:11:10,720
it's funny when you talk about like
damaged people and stuff like we,

2160
02:11:10,750 --> 02:11:15,310
we have a song called bad people that like
of that song. Thanks man. But you know,

2161
02:11:15,311 --> 02:11:18,430
it, it, it came from this
fascination with like,

2162
02:11:18,820 --> 02:11:21,940
why are people so mean?
Why are people doing shitty things?

2163
02:11:21,941 --> 02:11:24,770
Like why do you bust a car window and
steal somebody's shit? Why do you,

2164
02:11:25,200 --> 02:11:28,900
why you should, why do you all that?
That's one one way. But like, why,

2165
02:11:28,901 --> 02:11:31,400
why you sinister? Why are
you, where are you, you know,

2166
02:11:31,720 --> 02:11:34,330
poisoning the cats in my neighborhood.
Like there's this,

2167
02:11:34,331 --> 02:11:37,880
this fascination with where
that fucking comes from. Right.

2168
02:11:38,110 --> 02:11:41,030
And we wrote that song
and like, it, it was, it,

2169
02:11:41,230 --> 02:11:43,030
it was just kinda hanging out for a while.

2170
02:11:43,031 --> 02:11:47,290
It was really like thinking about
it for a long time, you know, just,

2171
02:11:47,350 --> 02:11:51,610
just why, how, when do you turn
or you born that way? Did you,

2172
02:11:51,640 --> 02:11:52,730
were you born into it like,

2173
02:11:52,900 --> 02:11:55,900
because bad people come from
Nice families all the time and,

2174
02:11:55,901 --> 02:11:59,530
and incredible people come from
fucking shit holes. You know,

2175
02:11:59,531 --> 02:12:04,330
they crawl out of a hole, but I don't know
if there's any one answer to it, but I,

2176
02:12:04,331 --> 02:12:08,560
I, I just, all I can say is that there's
a fascination with where it comes from.

2177
02:12:08,561 --> 02:12:09,394
I don't know.

2178
02:12:09,610 --> 02:12:12,130
What do you think is more,
more common?

2179
02:12:12,131 --> 02:12:15,620
Do you think it's more common for really
nice people to come out of total shit

2180
02:12:15,621 --> 02:12:20,621
hole environments or for really nice
families to have an asshole for a kid?

2181
02:12:22,510 --> 02:12:23,170
I think that,
yeah,

2182
02:12:23,170 --> 02:12:27,100
inspiration can hit someone
at edit an incredible, um,

2183
02:12:27,160 --> 02:12:31,570
like phenomenal rate when you
just don't even expect it.

2184
02:12:32,050 --> 02:12:32,883
I think,
um,

2185
02:12:33,040 --> 02:12:37,390
you can have information just like slammed
upside your head in like an instant

2186
02:12:37,391 --> 02:12:41,140
and it could be the littlest thing.
And I don't know.

2187
02:12:41,170 --> 02:12:46,030
I know that I'm privileged
families there have, um,

2188
02:12:46,970 --> 02:12:49,210
they, they have a, a comfort that,

2189
02:12:50,500 --> 02:12:54,270
that unprivileged families don't
have. Right. You know, and there's a,

2190
02:12:54,370 --> 02:12:59,370
there's just a completely
different perspective on
need and hunger and emotional

2191
02:13:01,481 --> 02:13:05,260
hunger. You could be emotionally
starved in any scenario. You could be,

2192
02:13:05,860 --> 02:13:06,670
you know what I mean?

2193
02:13:06,670 --> 02:13:10,100
Shape so much of who we
are. You know, and you,

2194
02:13:10,160 --> 02:13:15,150
you can have a bad experience in any
context. It doesn't matter if you, um,

2195
02:13:15,160 --> 02:13:17,800
you know, what's your, I don't
know, your social statuses.

2196
02:13:17,801 --> 02:13:21,890
You can solve a bad experience, you know,
and it can still shape you and sure.

2197
02:13:21,891 --> 02:13:26,590
What do we value? You know, we,
I think in general we have pot,

2198
02:13:26,650 --> 02:13:28,540
good values,
things to be excited about.

2199
02:13:28,541 --> 02:13:32,550
We value kindness and generosity
and things like, so it's rare

2200
02:13:33,190 --> 02:13:34,860
to see someone,

2201
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:39,690
I don't know if I necessarily believe it
that someone who comes out of a series

2202
02:13:39,691 --> 02:13:41,900
of good experiences just boom,

2203
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:45,570
we'll do things unless there's
serious psychological malfunctioning.

2204
02:13:45,571 --> 02:13:50,010
It's like you're going to treat people
as a reflection of your environment for

2205
02:13:50,011 --> 02:13:54,060
sure. What I think, I think we also have
this need to say it's this or it's that,

2206
02:13:54,930 --> 02:13:58,650
you know, it's, it's a disease
or it's a, it's its DNA or it's,

2207
02:13:59,100 --> 02:14:00,810
it's never that clear cut and dry.

2208
02:14:01,230 --> 02:14:04,680
I think there could be a lot of factors
and I think a lot of factors in your

2209
02:14:04,681 --> 02:14:08,700
environment and especially
your experience, they can
kind of push your genes,

2210
02:14:08,701 --> 02:14:12,300
they can push the chair person of
getting genetically whatever it was.

2211
02:14:12,310 --> 02:14:15,900
Those two things that weren't even
taught to you. Like, you know,

2212
02:14:15,901 --> 02:14:19,080
like your anger or your addiction
or whatever. And you know,

2213
02:14:19,081 --> 02:14:20,100
I think at the end of the day,

2214
02:14:20,101 --> 02:14:24,270
like everybody's got their suitcase and
we need to respect everybody suitcase

2215
02:14:24,300 --> 02:14:26,940
because like,
what might be a shitty day for me,

2216
02:14:26,941 --> 02:14:30,240
it could be like the worst day for
somebody or, or vice versa. You know,

2217
02:14:30,241 --> 02:14:34,730
you never know what someone's volume
level of their, their, you know,

2218
02:14:34,800 --> 02:14:38,580
capacity for stuff isn't. And you've got
to respect that, you know, like I'm like,

2219
02:14:38,610 --> 02:14:43,590
Oh man, um, I, I don't want
to get, but like I had a bad
day with blah, blah, blah,

2220
02:14:43,591 --> 02:14:47,730
and like, someone's like, Oh yeah, my
father killed my sister, you know, like,

2221
02:14:47,731 --> 02:14:51,660
you don't know. And that could be
their first day. And I'm like, Oh man,

2222
02:14:51,661 --> 02:14:54,300
I thought my day was bad.
But at the end of the day,

2223
02:14:54,301 --> 02:14:59,301
like everyone has a different volume of
what they're capable of experiencing and

2224
02:15:00,121 --> 02:15:03,690
if you're not capable of experiencing
it, you'll die. You know?

2225
02:15:03,990 --> 02:15:05,280
Like you're just like,

2226
02:15:05,281 --> 02:15:09,510
you have as much as you can take and
then if you can't take it, you're like,

2227
02:15:09,511 --> 02:15:12,270
that's, that's what your tie, it's like,

2228
02:15:12,320 --> 02:15:14,600
what are you, you know, what are you,

2229
02:15:14,601 --> 02:15:16,880
if you're not experiencing
anything and if you're not dead,

2230
02:15:17,300 --> 02:15:21,740
we just alone silent in a room. You'd
like that lady that kill halls people.

2231
02:15:21,741 --> 02:15:24,020
Then the left or on the castle,
that was her suitcase.

2232
02:15:24,920 --> 02:15:29,480
That was the suitcase she had to carry.
Yeah. If you're not experiencing anything,

2233
02:15:29,481 --> 02:15:32,750
you're barely alive though. That's
one of the tricks of being a person.

2234
02:15:33,050 --> 02:15:36,320
If you're not experiencing things, if
you, if you're not having ups and downs,

2235
02:15:36,350 --> 02:15:40,300
that's what you've got to go outside
your comfort zone. Get Weird.

2236
02:15:40,850 --> 02:15:44,960
You don't want to Austin, don't do
that. Don't buy one of those shirts.

2237
02:15:47,810 --> 02:15:52,640
Keep Austin weird. Keep
Portland Weird. Don't do it.

2238
02:15:53,060 --> 02:15:55,940
I know, and it's not your fault.
If you were about to buy it,

2239
02:15:55,941 --> 02:15:59,820
go on this fucking shirt.
Rule. I was going to buy.

2240
02:16:02,360 --> 02:16:03,110
Yeah.

2241
02:16:03,110 --> 02:16:05,720
If you've never seen it before and if
you're really young and you have a head

2242
02:16:05,721 --> 02:16:10,040
injury
was just kidding about the head injury.

2243
02:16:10,070 --> 02:16:13,580
These are chokes. If you're,
if you're a young person,

2244
02:16:13,610 --> 02:16:16,130
you don't know how ridiculous
it is to have a shirt on.

2245
02:16:16,131 --> 02:16:18,050
It says keep Austin Weird.
Yeah,

2246
02:16:18,170 --> 02:16:22,600
it's the same font and every shirt and
it pretends it's hand written eight

2247
02:16:22,610 --> 02:16:26,240
involved in a bad way. At one point
it meant something really important.

2248
02:16:26,750 --> 02:16:30,130
Not really because the people that
were crying about Portland weird

2249
02:16:30,130 --> 02:16:33,820
were fake weird. All of them. Every
one of them. They're all twats.

2250
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:39,490
The real weird people, they shut the
fuck up and stay weird. They stay weird,

2251
02:16:39,491 --> 02:16:41,080
you know,
fucking protests.

2252
02:16:41,290 --> 02:16:43,540
They don't want to get together
and make a Facebook page.

2253
02:16:43,541 --> 02:16:48,070
Keep Austin weird sign up here. If
you agree, thumbs up or thumbs down.

2254
02:16:48,080 --> 02:16:51,850
What's Joe? It's not. It's not.

2255
02:16:51,860 --> 02:16:55,000
They're only here because of sister
markets. See The hipster trap,

2256
02:16:55,060 --> 02:16:58,340
there would be no hipsters if they
had a forge for their own foods. None.

2257
02:16:59,230 --> 02:17:00,020
Supermarkets.

2258
02:17:00,020 --> 02:17:04,300
You think the hipster trap is a bear
trap and in the middle in the middle is

2259
02:17:04,301 --> 02:17:08,580
like a six pack of PBR. A pack of
American Spirit Lights in like ray bans.

2260
02:17:08,800 --> 02:17:11,020
Okay.
They should do the same thing,

2261
02:17:11,021 --> 02:17:16,021
but with Kale and alkalized water
veganic make sure it speak on it and the

2262
02:17:17,651 --> 02:17:20,950
goodwill cowboy.
I love all those things.

2263
02:17:20,950 --> 02:17:25,840
Ps love me a good. I like thrift
store cowboys, snap button shirt.

2264
02:17:26,140 --> 02:17:29,380
Well I think the, the, the inclination
behind being and hipsters good.

2265
02:17:29,590 --> 02:17:30,610
It's like they want to be,

2266
02:17:30,611 --> 02:17:34,920
they want to be above the stupid shit
they see every day. That's moron.

2267
02:17:34,930 --> 02:17:36,990
It can pedantic, is that the word? No.

2268
02:17:38,250 --> 02:17:40,600
If you want to get down to brass tacks,

2269
02:17:42,610 --> 02:17:43,660
I sure did.
You know,

2270
02:17:43,710 --> 02:17:47,980
I'm really trying to embrace my Midwestern
roots and just fucking go with it.

2271
02:17:48,130 --> 02:17:51,940
You know? It's just no my
wrath tech I'm talking about,

2272
02:17:53,170 --> 02:17:53,841
but you're totally,

2273
02:17:53,841 --> 02:17:58,210
you're already covered it make me want
to get Fargo on Netflix, first of all.

2274
02:17:58,211 --> 02:18:02,800
I'm not that far west. It's more
like, oh my God, go rounds. You know?

2275
02:18:02,801 --> 02:18:06,850
It's just like, it's not as like don't
share. No, it's not like more eastern.

2276
02:18:07,250 --> 02:18:11,320
It's more of an eastern, more
Rochester, a little less disgusting.

2277
02:18:11,321 --> 02:18:14,980
A little more books. It's still that
sexy. Let's call a spade a spade here,

2278
02:18:14,981 --> 02:18:17,290
and if you can get them out of there,
it become sexy.

2279
02:18:17,390 --> 02:18:20,680
It's the willing to take a
chance. Joe, you're so happy

2280
02:18:22,280 --> 02:18:26,190
to teaching ballet. I got to get
out of this fucking town. Actually.

2281
02:18:26,200 --> 02:18:30,220
She's on the rock and roll tour bus. Ooh.
Hanging out with the first black guy.

2282
02:18:32,700 --> 02:18:37,000
No, no. I brought, I brought us to
sit down. I was like, wait, I'm lost.

2283
02:18:37,370 --> 02:18:40,870
Listen, we just did three fucking
hours of a single song and that's,

2284
02:18:41,030 --> 02:18:44,770
that's not going to happen to you though.
So what we're going to do,

2285
02:18:44,860 --> 02:18:49,090
since you guys are, look, I know how you
think. This is what we're going to do.

2286
02:18:49,150 --> 02:18:50,130
This is no time for trials.

2287
02:18:50,260 --> 02:18:52,410
We don't have to saying we could
just talk me to do it. We're gonna.

2288
02:18:52,420 --> 02:18:55,540
We're take a bathroom break. Exactly. See,

2289
02:18:55,870 --> 02:19:00,010
and then we'll come back and we'll do
a second podcast where we talk way less

2290
02:19:00,011 --> 02:19:04,060
shit did we do okay? Awesome.

2291
02:19:04,240 --> 02:19:08,890
We made a bunch of quarter
to seven though, right? Yeah,

2292
02:19:08,920 --> 02:19:12,310
we got about 20 minutes.
We've got 20 minutes,

2293
02:19:12,311 --> 02:19:15,670
but I think it'd be better if we did two
different podcasts. I think it's cool.

2294
02:19:19,500 --> 02:19:22,630
We should definitely do that in
both podcasts, especially the ones,

2295
02:19:23,730 --> 02:19:26,530
but they get to see how
good you guys are now.

2296
02:19:28,440 --> 02:19:32,780
And the new video, let me
keep talking about on the
treadmill right now. You fuck.

2297
02:19:32,810 --> 02:19:37,660
I've been running for two hours and
20 man, I don't to use talk. Oh,

2298
02:19:37,700 --> 02:19:42,380
Joe Rogan make them saying
shit. Okay, bad about this.

2299
02:19:42,440 --> 02:19:45,040
This is all super positive.
That's good.

2300
02:19:45,050 --> 02:19:47,240
So we'll take a little
pee break for a second.

2301
02:19:47,530 --> 02:19:50,930
You were going to take a pee break and
we're going to come back and we got to

2302
02:19:50,931 --> 02:19:54,470
come back with a completely different
podcasts in a totally mellow vibe.

2303
02:19:54,830 --> 02:19:59,540
We're going to do is we're going to do
what Americans in 2015 called hug it out.

2304
02:19:59,570 --> 02:20:02,180
Ooh. Hugs. We total.

2305
02:20:02,210 --> 02:20:07,190
And we're going to prepare for
the next hour, the next hour.

2306
02:20:07,250 --> 02:20:09,290
We're just going to have a good time,
right?

2307
02:20:09,380 --> 02:20:14,090
So this is the onus footage coming up.
You fucking monsters.

2308
02:20:14,091 --> 02:20:16,460
We'll see soon. Alright, bye. Bye.
