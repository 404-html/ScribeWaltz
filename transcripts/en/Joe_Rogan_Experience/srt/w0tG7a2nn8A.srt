1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,000
To one,
yes,

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:03,990
yes,
yes.

3
00:00:03,991 --> 00:00:04,710
Trevor,
we're here.

4
00:00:04,711 --> 00:00:07,170
We're back to two years,
almost to the day.

5
00:00:07,171 --> 00:00:09,240
And we didn't even plan it that way.
Know it was weird.

6
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:11,280
I was,
I pulled it up and I'm like,

7
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:12,000
oh,
hey,

8
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,520
I was here in 2014.
Wasn't October Shit,

9
00:00:14,521 --> 00:00:18,030
October 23rd and in two years 
something's happened to your beard where

10
00:00:18,031 --> 00:00:22,080
it's a bright yellow that doesn't exist 
in nature or it exists in flowers,

11
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:23,350
flowers.
Uh,

12
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:25,620
it,
it reacts under black light as well.

13
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,680
Oh yeah.
My twitter profile pictures under black 

14
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:30,680
light.
Um,

15
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,990
yeah.
I used to dye my beard crazy fucking 

16
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:34,990
colors all the time.
It was like green,

17
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:36,020
purple and blue and all that.
And uh,

18
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,880
I did this neon yellow and I've always 
liked it.

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,950
And the girl I was dating always hated 
it.

20
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:42,180
Perfect.
So yeah,

21
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,010
run with it.
It's my,

22
00:00:44,011 --> 00:00:45,330
uh,
my vengeance.

23
00:00:45,331 --> 00:00:48,960
Does this crazy shirt you go onto,
was this ms dot atonic university,

24
00:00:48,961 --> 00:00:51,030
you know,
a could Fulu HP lovecraft.

25
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,130
Yeah.
Uh,

26
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:54,270
this company does it.
Well,

27
00:00:54,271 --> 00:00:59,250
they're called Geeky jerseys and they do
just radical fucking jersey.

28
00:00:59,251 --> 00:01:02,720
So this is like the Cafe Lulu Jersey and
it's like a wizard Jersey to look,

29
00:01:02,721 --> 00:01:05,430
look at the sleeves,
the hockey sleeves,

30
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,600
so it's legit.
Hockey sleeve goalie cuts a little bit 

31
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,430
Baggier I thought you're all wizard.
I know they do stuff like a,

32
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:19,440
they've got like a game of thrones 
jerseys and all this crazy stuff and 

33
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:19,620
they were just like,
hey,

34
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:24,621
you do a lot of talks and you always 
wear a jersey so we're just gonna start 

35
00:01:24,621 --> 00:01:24,621
sending you yours.
And I'm like,

36
00:01:24,621 --> 00:01:24,621
oh,
okay.

37
00:01:24,621 --> 00:01:26,830
Well that's very nice of them because I 
always wear a hockey jersey.

38
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,270
When I was in here I was trying to be 
last time professional with the Polo and

39
00:01:30,271 --> 00:01:31,490
all that.
Oh yeah,

40
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:34,500
he was that because you are promoting 
something.

41
00:01:34,501 --> 00:01:35,160
You had to be.

42
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,350
Yeah,
I had to be a little bit more clean cut.

43
00:01:37,351 --> 00:01:41,870
It was like Nat Geo,
like a mandate there.

44
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,760
Are they giving you like,
like standards of dress and stuff?

45
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:49,790
Not really,
but since it was like a pretty 

46
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:51,690
professional documentary,
we were doing a,

47
00:01:51,691 --> 00:01:56,520
it was suggested very lightly by my 
publicist and she's just like,

48
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:57,360
well,
you know,

49
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,130
business casual,
maybe business.

50
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:02,760
I'm like,
but I were hockey jerseys in short.

51
00:02:02,761 --> 00:02:03,300
She's like,
yeah,

52
00:02:03,301 --> 00:02:04,060
no.
Oh,

53
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,990
why not?
That's why I'm doing it now.

54
00:02:06,991 --> 00:02:07,950
Mad.
Isn't it funny?

55
00:02:07,951 --> 00:02:10,100
It's like you're a legitimate 
paleontologists.

56
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,090
You actually do real research.
Like why?

57
00:02:12,091 --> 00:02:17,091
Why?
Why do you have to dress like everybody 

58
00:02:17,091 --> 00:02:18,810
knows your credentials?
Like the thing about that,

59
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,120
the crazy thing is,
I mean there's the whole Paleo thing 

60
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,360
too.
It's weird when you ask somebody,

61
00:02:27,361 --> 00:02:28,140
hey,
is like,

62
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,660
do you know what a paleontologist is?
A lot of people say yes.

63
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,460
A lot of people go,
Hey Ross on friends.

64
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,010
What's Ross on?
Oh,

65
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,240
I forgot he was a paleontologist.
Bull shitty was.

66
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:44,300
I know,
right fucking due to all that free time 

67
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:44,300
hanging out in a coffee shop talking 
about nonsense.

68
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:49,340
I know.
I know like our one position guys at 

69
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:53,001
museums that doing like full academics,
they would never have that amount of 

70
00:02:53,001 --> 00:02:53,130
time.
No time.

71
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:56,370
No zero a fucked.
It's crazy.

72
00:02:56,371 --> 00:02:58,740
You can't be a casual paleontologist.
Right.

73
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,540
And I asked them,
what is a paleontologist look like?

74
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:04,780
When I used to work at the tar pits,
I would ask like,

75
00:03:04,781 --> 00:03:06,640
kids on tours and stuff like that.
And they're like,

76
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,560
oh,
he's got like a hat and a whip.

77
00:03:08,561 --> 00:03:10,050
I'm like,
they're describing Indiana Jones.

78
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:10,630
Yeah,
yeah,

79
00:03:10,631 --> 00:03:11,800
yeah.
That's why you were right.

80
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:12,670
Yeah,
sure.

81
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,950
Um,
and I'm like,

82
00:03:14,951 --> 00:03:19,951
okay,
well I have a neon orange beard and I'm 

83
00:03:19,951 --> 00:03:19,951
wearing a lab coat and I'm covered in 
tattoos.

84
00:03:19,951 --> 00:03:21,190
Do you think I'm apparently there and 
you know,

85
00:03:21,191 --> 00:03:25,000
you're like a biker and here's,
here's the stuff.

86
00:03:25,001 --> 00:03:27,970
Welcome to my lab.
This is my deal going on.

87
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:33,270
You can get away with that in 2016.
But if you were living in the 19 

88
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:33,270
seventies,
good luck.

89
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:37,410
Oh,
I would be burned at the metaphorical 

90
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:37,410
stake.
Wouldn't have worked.

91
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:41,010
No,
it's like because I had long hair and 

92
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:41,010
died.
Weird colors.

93
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:41,010
You know,
it's funny,

94
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:41,010
Dude.
You,

95
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:41,380
uh,
you know,

96
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,510
like I said,
you're a legit paleontologists,

97
00:03:43,511 --> 00:03:47,110
but I saw you the other day arguing with
flat earth people on twitter.

98
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:51,040
I'm also a science generalists.
Like,

99
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:52,960
Holy Shit,
dude,

100
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:54,880
you going to war?
It was hilarious.

101
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:59,881
I checked back an hour later,
you're still going at it because you 

102
00:03:59,881 --> 00:04:00,250
threw it out there.
And I'm like,

103
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,200
okay,
I see where this is going.

104
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,720
Someone was calling me a flat earth sell
out.

105
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,650
The guy was calling me a sellout because
uh,

106
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,910
because I,
I make fun of flat earth.

107
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,670
And he's like,
I know where your checks being cashed.

108
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:16,570
Like what I'm getting around Earth.
Like,

109
00:04:16,571 --> 00:04:19,160
hey,
keep a secret right around earth check.

110
00:04:19,161 --> 00:04:24,161
Here's the shill organization.
Imagine if like everybody in the media 

111
00:04:24,161 --> 00:04:25,930
was just getting a check to make sure 
that you keep,

112
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:29,110
just keep perpetrating the lie that the 
earth is round,

113
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,280
like the logic behind that,
but it's not just fucking flatter and 

114
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,280
flatter.
And Chem trails and creationism and moon

115
00:04:36,281 --> 00:04:41,281
hoaxers and the reptilians have just all
the weird shit man.

116
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,440
Speaking of trade one is the craziest 
one.

117
00:04:44,441 --> 00:04:49,441
Like,
like everything is round except the 

118
00:04:49,441 --> 00:04:49,441
earth.
Is that what you're saying?

119
00:04:49,441 --> 00:04:51,070
Like all the videos have all been faked.
Every one of them.

120
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,770
Every space station mission that took 
video.

121
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:55,810
Every space shuttle mission that God 
video,

122
00:04:55,811 --> 00:04:58,270
every satellite that gets photographed 
on it's fake,

123
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:03,330
all of it's everything from,
from the beginning of the 19 sixties 

124
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:04,000
when they first started doing this to 
today.

125
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:04,920
So fake.
Yeah.

126
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:08,290
So I've actually gotten a huge fucking 
debates about that.

127
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:08,840
Like,
oh,

128
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,800
like people on twitter live and online.
Well,

129
00:05:11,801 --> 00:05:15,460
and there was one person a cap.
What was his name?

130
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,410
Uh,
he came in,

131
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:22,710
he came into the bar that I bartend at 
now and he was talking about it briefly 

132
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:23,320
and he's like,
yeah,

133
00:05:23,321 --> 00:05:23,950
you know,
uh,

134
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:26,350
you know,
I heard you on the Joe Rogan program and

135
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,000
it was really cool and you know,
he's like,

136
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,720
not really cool with conspiracy 
theorists and all that.

137
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:31,140
I'm like,
no,

138
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,060
he gives them like equal time.
He's like,

139
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,680
yeah,
the whole flat earth thing.

140
00:05:35,681 --> 00:05:36,820
I'm like,
don't even start,

141
00:05:36,821 --> 00:05:39,010
man.
He was serious.

142
00:05:39,011 --> 00:05:41,320
Yeah.
It's these fucking youtube videos.

143
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:46,350
That's what it is.
You watch youtube videos and no one's 

144
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:46,420
opposing them while they're talking to.
They're talking very.

145
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:48,440
They're,
they sound very articulate.

146
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:53,680
They using all these big words and 
they're saying things without anybody 

147
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:53,680
go,
what?

148
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:53,770
Stop.
Stop.

149
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:58,890
That's not true,
and that's the problem and I both them 

150
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:03,070
and science at the same time.
How do you blame science will a long 

151
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:06,491
time ago when we had guys like Richard 
Hoagland doing the face on Mars and 

152
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:07,910
crazy shit like that,
um,

153
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:12,830
or like early creationists are flood 
geology or flatter things way in the way

154
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:14,260
in the back of,
you know,

155
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:19,490
in the backwards time,
like science would always like shoved 

156
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:20,050
off into a corner and go,
hey,

157
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,800
see the cranks over there.
Let's ignore them.

158
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:23,600
If we ignore them,
they'll go away.

159
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:29,170
And then we got things like compuserve 
and AOL and forums and bbss and then 

160
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:31,460
they got a little louder than they got 
access to self publishing.

161
00:06:31,461 --> 00:06:34,670
They got a little louder now with social
media,

162
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:39,760
Youtube and all that.
The same five percent of humanity can 

163
00:06:39,861 --> 00:06:44,861
get really fucking loud.
We didn't shut them down early enough 

164
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:49,160
and now they're loud enough that we have
a problem.

165
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:50,420
Well,
Hoagland,

166
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:55,540
out of his fucking mind.
I watched a whole lecture where he was 

167
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:59,540
talking about all of the artificial 
structures on the moon and this guy just

168
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:05,260
arbitrarily measures the distance 
between this rock and the point of this 

169
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:05,690
period of it.
It's not a pyramid,

170
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:06,890
but he would call it a pyramid,
right?

171
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:10,100
The district.
This is exactly the same distance as the

172
00:07:10,101 --> 00:07:15,101
pyramid in Giza.
The connection to the left foot of the 

173
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:15,350
sphinx and like,
how do you.

174
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,190
What?
Why,

175
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:21,460
why?
Why are you making that connection that 

176
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:21,460
you could do that anywhere.
You could just,

177
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:21,530
you could do,
you could overlay.

178
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,290
You could do a map of a city and just 
start the.

179
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:29,090
The distance between your house and my 
house is exactly the same as my house to

180
00:07:29,091 --> 00:07:29,950
that rock.
Oh yeah.

181
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,970
That rock holds special significance.
Yeah.

182
00:07:31,971 --> 00:07:32,480
It's like,
oh,

183
00:07:32,481 --> 00:07:34,820
your house is on a Ley line and minds 
off that,

184
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:35,060
right?

185
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:35,570
It's like,
no,

186
00:07:35,571 --> 00:07:37,280
just stop.
It was madness.

187
00:07:37,281 --> 00:07:42,281
I watched this whole.
It was more than an hour long and I was 

188
00:07:42,281 --> 00:07:43,100
watching all these ridiculous 
connections that this guy was making and

189
00:07:43,101 --> 00:07:46,580
trying to say that all these structures 
that the odds of them being,

190
00:07:46,581 --> 00:07:48,290
you know,
some sort of a natural,

191
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,390
and I'm looking at him like,
that looks like a fucking rock to me.

192
00:07:50,391 --> 00:07:51,640
Yeah.
And he was saying there's,

193
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:56,650
without a doubt,
that is an artificially created 

194
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,661
structure.
Absolutely made by intelligent life 

195
00:07:58,661 --> 00:08:01,860
that,
that was the thing with the whole face 

196
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:01,860
on Mars when,
uh,

197
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,590
the Mars reconnaissance orbiter started 
doing the flyovers and then he was 

198
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:09,161
getting loud,
or why aren't you going to photograph 

199
00:08:09,161 --> 00:08:09,161
the site?
Don't in planes,

200
00:08:09,161 --> 00:08:09,161
blah,
blah.

201
00:08:09,161 --> 00:08:09,161
And they're fine.
Fine.

202
00:08:09,161 --> 00:08:09,560
You know what?
Fuck it.

203
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:11,720
We're re,
we're redirecting the satellite.

204
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,210
We're going to do eight passes,
high res photos,

205
00:08:14,211 --> 00:08:14,720
the whole deal.

206
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,530
And like,
oh look,

207
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:17,870
it's a mountain dew.
Cool look.

208
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,120
And it's Rad looking mountain.
It's weird.

209
00:08:20,121 --> 00:08:22,270
It's got a weird shape on the bottom.
The,

210
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:22,610
the,
the,

211
00:08:22,611 --> 00:08:24,110
the,
what's interesting to me,

212
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:29,500
far more interesting in the face because
the face was cool in the first picture 

213
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:33,131
because of the shadows and it kind of 
almost looked at a face and it was also 

214
00:08:33,131 --> 00:08:34,760
a low risk picture from Viking and then 
when they got high res pictures you go,

215
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:39,790
Oh,
well it's just a trick of the shadows 

216
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:42,491
and everything.
What's kind of interesting is what does 

217
00:08:42,491 --> 00:08:45,311
happen sometimes in nature.
You get these bizarre shapes almost 

218
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:49,511
looks like someone built it,
like it's kind of on both sides is 

219
00:08:49,511 --> 00:08:51,200
parallel lines.
The way it's shaped,

220
00:08:51,201 --> 00:08:53,540
it's almost like a creative piece,
but look at,

221
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,600
look at the hexagonal cleavage at devils
post pile or the giant's causeway in 

222
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,150
Scotland and stuff like that.

223
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:05,450
That looks like it's set in.
That's just because it's hexagonal 

224
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:09,621
cleavage or that one spot on Jupiter.
You know that one spot on the top of 

225
00:09:09,661 --> 00:09:14,661
Jupiter,
the top is the status of the hexagon 

226
00:09:14,661 --> 00:09:16,110
because of sheer winds.
Amazing.

227
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:18,690
I talked to a friend that works at jpl 
and I'm like,

228
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,190
what is going on here?
It's like,

229
00:09:20,191 --> 00:09:25,191
oh,
there's different densities of air and 

230
00:09:25,191 --> 00:09:25,191
sheer winds and it creates this cool 
hexagon.

231
00:09:25,191 --> 00:09:26,020
That's amazing.
Yeah.

232
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,820
I mean it's as.
It's a base intelligent base.

233
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:35,360
The same guy who puts out this video's 
about the flat earth now has a video 

234
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,500
that you will love and it's dinosaurs 
are not real,

235
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:39,190
which is right up your alley.
Oh,

236
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,440
great.
I didn't know that you were,

237
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,580
uh,
also,

238
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:45,090
um,
you're not just a flat earth Shill,

239
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:47,850
but you are also a dinosaur show.
Oh yeah.

240
00:09:47,851 --> 00:09:48,900
I'm,
I'm a dinosaur.

241
00:09:48,901 --> 00:09:52,890
She'll a around show a globe earth 
shill.

242
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,290
I worked for chem trail corporations.

243
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,110
Yeah.
All these.

244
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,110
If you could just tell us what is the 
purpose of the chem trails?

245
00:10:01,111 --> 00:10:06,111
What are they trying to do?
It depends on who's talking because 

246
00:10:06,111 --> 00:10:06,630
they've had like 19 different fucking 
stories.

247
00:10:06,631 --> 00:10:08,310
It's like one,
it's like mind control.

248
00:10:08,311 --> 00:10:13,311
The second one is population control.
The third one is solar radiation 

249
00:10:13,311 --> 00:10:13,311
management to,
you know,

250
00:10:13,311 --> 00:10:18,111
to either make global warming or to stop
global warming and they fight with each 

251
00:10:18,111 --> 00:10:20,200
other.
All it is,

252
00:10:20,201 --> 00:10:23,450
is bullshit.
One hundred percent fucking bullshit.

253
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:28,460
It's,
you can download a is the same link that

254
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,460
you re tweeted out with the,
with the,

255
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,930
when we did the chem trail back and 
forth on twitter.

256
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:39,270
Um,
you can get a humidity chart of every 

257
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:41,730
day to your location,
gives you the range of humidity into the

258
00:10:41,731 --> 00:10:43,590
stratosphere.
And you know,

259
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:48,800
when a plane we'll have a contrail will 
have a persistent contrail and won't 

260
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,230
have anything.

261
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:52,860
It's home fucking citizen's science.
That can be done.

262
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:58,030
Yeah.
I mean NASA has a website where they 

263
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:58,030
predict contracts.
They're super accurate.

264
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:58,380
Yeah,
absolutely.

265
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:03,410
And I've,
I've ripped people apart with this and 

266
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:03,410
then all of a sudden it's like where you
go from now.

267
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:03,870
So you're now.
So she'll,

268
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:07,860
well you're arguing with 15 year olds 
probably.

269
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:10,560
There's a lot of it.
Some of her.

270
00:11:10,561 --> 00:11:11,870
Oh,
speaking of controls.

271
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,470
I got this for you.
What is it?

272
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,320
Team Kentrell baby.
Oh,

273
00:11:16,321 --> 00:11:18,510
nice.
Team chem trail.

274
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:22,860
Spray and pray and pray on and off.
There's an on and off button.

275
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,440
Put this on my car.
People are going to key it.

276
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,230
Going to be mad fucking chill.
It's um,

277
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,400
it's a weird world.
We live in.

278
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:33,800
Trevor.
To weird world,

279
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:38,830
there's this access to self publishing,
whether it's youtube or blogs or 

280
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:42,180
podcasts.
You don't need anybody to tell you like,

281
00:11:42,181 --> 00:11:45,030
hey man,
we just ran a check on your information.

282
00:11:45,031 --> 00:11:50,031
Your data's all wrong.
You could just do it to the dinosaur 

283
00:11:50,031 --> 00:11:53,811
one.
This guy made this fucking video about 

284
00:11:53,811 --> 00:11:53,811
dinosaurs not being real.
I'm like,

285
00:11:53,811 --> 00:11:54,470
this is God damned hilarious

286
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:56,800
is that.
I think I just.

287
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
And it's so.
My whole involvement with this on 

288
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,811
twitter is all take that Darwin's fault.
I'd started failing in Darwin.

289
00:12:07,181 --> 00:12:08,440
The,
the twitter handle.

290
00:12:08,441 --> 00:12:08,850
Yeah.
Yeah.

291
00:12:08,851 --> 00:12:10,720
It's a great twitter handle.
Take the Darwin.

292
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:16,020
He has spawned an entire fucking like 
nest of people.

293
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:20,410
Take that earth theory,
fail that whenever somebody says,

294
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,760
oh,
evolution is just a theory,

295
00:12:21,761 --> 00:12:25,270
he jumps in,
take that salt for vaccines.

296
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:27,490
Um,
take that for skin,

297
00:12:27,491 --> 00:12:31,030
for like for circumcision.
There's like,

298
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:33,130
take that science.
He's the general one.

299
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,520
Take that etymology.
She just does words that people fuck up.

300
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:40,000
This whole group,
he spawned this,

301
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:44,020
this just psychology,
science communication.

302
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,230
Hey,
look at the specimen idiots.

303
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,680
There's like 30 of them and there's also
a take that dinosaurs that does all the 

304
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,470
dinosaur retreating.
They really are,

305
00:12:53,471 --> 00:12:56,920
is a growing movement where people don't
think dinosaurs were real well.

306
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,920
So it was like last year or the year 
before.

307
00:12:59,921 --> 00:13:04,090
I think it was maybe may have been right
after I did the show last time there was

308
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:09,210
a,
there was this bogus group that started 

309
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:12,241
a facebook thing called Christians 
against dinosaurs and they put pictures 

310
00:13:12,241 --> 00:13:14,920
of a protest and all of their like,
oh no,

311
00:13:14,921 --> 00:13:16,750
it's big Paleo,
like,

312
00:13:16,751 --> 00:13:19,780
are you fucking kidding?
It was a total hoax.

313
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:22,180
So it was like an onion type deal.
Exactly.

314
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:25,300
Parody.
But they started to run with it and just

315
00:13:25,301 --> 00:13:30,301
like have a fun time.
They found me and a couple other 

316
00:13:30,301 --> 00:13:32,641
paleontologists on twitter than I 
noticed their entire protest photo was 

317
00:13:32,641 --> 00:13:35,620
actually photo shopped from a parking,
uh,

318
00:13:35,621 --> 00:13:40,621
parking protest I think in Scotland 
because there's this one fun little 

319
00:13:40,621 --> 00:13:44,500
graphic of like no feathered dinosaurs 
that paleontologist came up with because

320
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,470
we're just crazy people and they use 
that graphic.

321
00:13:47,471 --> 00:13:48,310
I'm like,
wait a minute.

322
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:53,660
And so I found all the artifacts and 
photoshop and I called them out on them 

323
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:57,061
and they just got real quiet real fast.
There's a big debate about whether or 

324
00:13:57,061 --> 00:13:57,550
not dinosaurs had feathers,
right?

325
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:59,090
Um,
yeah,

326
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:04,100
but it depends on the dinosaur.
So sort of like depends on lizard 

327
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:04,100
versus.
Depends on the bird,

328
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:04,780
right?
Right.

329
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:08,170
Many dinosaurs,
uh,

330
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:13,320
either have evidence of feathers or they
are morphologically similar to dinosaurs

331
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,200
with feathers.
I'm like raptors,

332
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:21,350
we have found a feather imprints.
There's the quill knobs on the owner 

333
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:27,400
where the wings would be and we have 
found theropods the beast footed 

334
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:31,801
dinosaurs with feathers.
Whether or not they all did is the 

335
00:14:31,801 --> 00:14:33,130
question,
did tyrannosaurs have feathers?

336
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,800
Not quite sure yet.
Likely maybe as a baby.

337
00:14:35,801 --> 00:14:38,620
And then when it grew up,
but I don't know,

338
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:41,500
it could be a 14 foot long.
Chicken is a,

339
00:14:41,501 --> 00:14:42,200
um,
uh,

340
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,170
a replica of a dinosaur.

341
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:49,170
I forget which dinosaur.
I think it's a raptor and it's at the 

342
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:52,400
university or the Museum of Bozeman,
Bozeman,

343
00:14:52,401 --> 00:14:57,401
Montana.
And they have this feather dinosaur up 

344
00:14:57,401 --> 00:15:02,140
on display.
It's really kind of interesting because 

345
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:04,360
one half of it,
they have a kind of split down the 

346
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,611
middle of one,
half of it is covered in feathers and 

347
00:15:06,611 --> 00:15:06,611
the other half of it you just see the 
actual bones itself.

348
00:15:06,611 --> 00:15:07,220
Oh,
that's cool.

349
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,590
Like,
like that old invisible,

350
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,620
invisible human that we had to put 
together like in the,

351
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:13,550
in the eighties.
Yeah,

352
00:15:13,551 --> 00:15:14,870
exactly right.
Yeah.

353
00:15:14,871 --> 00:15:16,820
See if he could find that Jamie,
because it's pretty cool.

354
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:17,740
But you know,
they,

355
00:15:17,741 --> 00:15:20,360
they go with all these wild crazy colors
of feathers.

356
00:15:20,361 --> 00:15:25,361
It's like,
it's almost too bad we can't figure out 

357
00:15:25,361 --> 00:15:28,001
what they really looked like because 
we're just kind of piecing together 

358
00:15:28,001 --> 00:15:29,270
their skin texture and just guessing on 
the colors.

359
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,610
Every once in a while we'll find 
something awesome.

360
00:15:31,611 --> 00:15:32,270
Like,
uh,

361
00:15:32,271 --> 00:15:37,271
there was uh,
the [inaudible] a Hadrosaur Leonardo 

362
00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:39,350
that actually had skin and organs that 
soft tissue,

363
00:15:39,351 --> 00:15:44,351
that mineralized and all this cool stuff
or feather imprints from archaeopteryx 

364
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:47,810
or I'm like,
interesting.

365
00:15:47,811 --> 00:15:52,811
Looked looking like a beat,
a beat dinosaurs like aqua lops and 

366
00:15:52,811 --> 00:15:54,320
stuff.
Really Cool Shit.

367
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:55,250
But

368
00:15:56,650 --> 00:16:01,650
the problem is,
is just it's fossils are rare doing any 

369
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:04,030
sort of soft tissue preservation is 
rare,

370
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:09,150
extremely rare,
and all the lighter material just Kinda 

371
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:11,080
desiccates and falls away.
So when we find something like that,

372
00:16:11,081 --> 00:16:16,081
it's holy crap,
just shut everything down and focus on 

373
00:16:16,081 --> 00:16:20,401
it real quick.
That's the most fascinating thing about 

374
00:16:20,401 --> 00:16:22,591
the fossil record to me and said how 
difficult it is to actually make a 

375
00:16:22,591 --> 00:16:22,591
fossil.
Yeah.

376
00:16:22,591 --> 00:16:23,660
Most things just write,
write,

377
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,740
write it.
It has to be certain,

378
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:28,890
certain conditions it.
Um,

379
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,820
but most people think,
oh,

380
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:36,060
it has to be buried in water.
And then like turn in sand covering it 

381
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:36,060
and all that.
Well that's one way.

382
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,890
And that's a very common way.
Like a lot of the stuff in Montana,

383
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:42,430
a that used to be swamp land with a 
western interior seaway.

384
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:45,970
So dinosaurs like a t rex and 
triceratops,

385
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:48,160
they would get a covered in mud and 
sediment,

386
00:16:48,161 --> 00:16:48,430
all that.

387
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:52,240
And the bones would generalize the 
calcium on the outside of the bone would

388
00:16:52,241 --> 00:16:55,030
get replaced with minerals in the water 
and the sand.

389
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:57,070
And then they would get buried in 
sandstone.

390
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:00,310
It's all cool.
But then you've got things that can fall

391
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:02,770
into peat bogs,
natural trap caves,

392
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:07,860
tarpits like here in la,
and all sorts of other things that 

393
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:11,911
create fossils which are really cool.
So it's not just mineralization through 

394
00:17:13,181 --> 00:17:18,181
water that is hard to do.
It can happen quickly depending on the 

395
00:17:18,221 --> 00:17:23,221
limestone,
the amount of limestone in the dripping 

396
00:17:23,221 --> 00:17:23,590
you can.
There was somebody that like left a boot

397
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:28,680
in a heavily limestone water cave and 
calcified like in a matter of weeks.

398
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:33,490
But that's not really mineralization 
that's more like encasement.

399
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:38,200
But yeah,
fossils are fossils are rare.

400
00:17:38,201 --> 00:17:42,460
To do a fossil is rare that the concept 
I think also alludes people.

401
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:46,990
Most people when they see a fossil bone,
they think that that's the bone itself,

402
00:17:46,991 --> 00:17:51,991
just really old.
And what it is is the minerals have 

403
00:17:51,991 --> 00:17:53,580
replaced the bone in the actual shape of
the bone.

404
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,700
I tried to explain that to a friend of 
mine who had a mega don tooth,

405
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:58,980
you know,
he's saying this is a megalodon tooth.

406
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:00,240
And I said,
well,

407
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,940
it's a fossil of a mega non tooth.
I go,

408
00:18:02,941 --> 00:18:05,220
it's not really the tooth anymore.
None of the tooth remains.

409
00:18:05,221 --> 00:18:06,900
It's just the shape of the tooth.
He's like,

410
00:18:06,901 --> 00:18:07,470
no,
I bought it.

411
00:18:07,471 --> 00:18:08,490
It's a megalodon tooth.
I'm like,

412
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:11,190
it's.
But you notice how it's black,

413
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:14,040
like they don't have black teeth.
Yeah.

414
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,080
See,
that's one side of it.

415
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:18,570
And then the other side of it,
you can see it like that.

416
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,700
It's got like a punk rock hairdo and 
shit.

417
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,890
Crazy face.
It's pretty dope.

418
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,820
I've,
I've seen that.

419
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,730
I've seen,
I've actually used the opposite photo in

420
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:28,270
a talk.
Um,

421
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,280
because it looks like they're humping.
Yeah.

422
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:33,420
From one angle.
And uh,

423
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:34,360
I have,
I have it.

424
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,130
Yep.
There it is.

425
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:35,940
I've used that.

426
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,650
I have a talk called that's not a 
fucking dinosaur.

427
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:44,360
And I opened up with images of dinosaurs
fucking um,

428
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,830
just because you have to do that just to
be fun.

429
00:18:46,831 --> 00:18:47,760
Just to be fun.
Yeah.

430
00:18:47,761 --> 00:18:52,761
That,
that is a cool one with the long hair 

431
00:18:52,761 --> 00:18:55,341
and yeah,
it kind of looks like the seventies 

432
00:18:55,341 --> 00:18:57,621
dinosaur and it's like,
it used to be a roadie for like van 

433
00:18:57,621 --> 00:18:57,621
Halen and the eighties and that kind of 
thing.

434
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:02,640
The skid row dinosaur.
What's a crazy looking shape and when 

435
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:02,700
you see all those colors,
but again,

436
00:19:02,701 --> 00:19:05,130
it's just an artistic interpretation,
right?

437
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:10,160
We don't know and that's the thing.
We get a lot of flack for that and was 

438
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:10,160
like,
how do you know it looked like that.

439
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,940
We don't.
We know.

440
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:17,300
We know how the bones go together.
We know where the muscle points are so 

441
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,290
we can figure out the girth of the 
muscle,

442
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,770
the connection points,
and then you can kind of build out a leg

443
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,050
and then we go to town.

444
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:25,980
It's like,
hey,

445
00:19:25,981 --> 00:19:28,620
maybe they were pink.
Trx is could be pink.

446
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:30,750
It could have been.
They could fucking beard color.

447
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:32,700
We don't know.
No idea.

448
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:37,780
Yeah,
a couple of feathers and skin 

449
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,861
impressions and stuff like that.
We found they may have counter shading 

450
00:19:39,861 --> 00:19:41,220
like modern day reptiles and mammals and
all that.

451
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:43,080
They're darker on top,
lighter on the bottom.

452
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:47,370
A sharks are great example of that 
because that's hard to see.

453
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:52,350
It breaks up the silhouette.
They had some sort of natural camouflage

454
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:57,210
to blend in with their surroundings if 
they were an herbivore or to Haydn as an

455
00:19:57,211 --> 00:19:59,670
ambush predator.
Their animals.

456
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:04,850
We can still see analogs today,
but people want to see like,

457
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:11,450
how do we know that it looked like this?
How do we know that it walked like this?

458
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,890
Well,
we don't know 100 percent,

459
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:18,510
but we can make inferred guesses because
we have a shit ton of bones to look at.

460
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:22,050
It is pretty much it.
Is there any possibility whatsoever that

461
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,280
one day we'll find like an intact t-rex 
frozen somewhere?

462
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:27,960
Probably not.
Probably not,

463
00:20:27,961 --> 00:20:32,530
right?
It's too bad because I mean it's,

464
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:35,100
it's a little different.
Hitting a mammoth that was 30,000

465
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:36,000
years old,
uh,

466
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:41,070
like,
like I did in Siberia and a 65 and a 

467
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:41,760
half million year old,
20 foot long,

468
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:46,870
like walking death machine.
Little little different and there was 

469
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:51,471
no,
there wasn't a whole lot of ice and not 

470
00:20:51,471 --> 00:20:51,471
a whole lot of,
uh,

471
00:20:51,471 --> 00:20:53,650
like polar activity during the 
Cretaceous period.

472
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:59,550
That's why there were a whole bunch of 
water masses like cutting the United 

473
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:03,250
States in half and most of California 
was the Arizona Bay,

474
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:07,850
that kind of thing.
So finding an intact t-rex,

475
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:09,460
like frozen,
like holy Shit,

476
00:21:09,461 --> 00:21:13,570
look skin likely we'll probably highly 
improbable.

477
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:18,990
However,
there is a possibility we could find 

478
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:21,790
something like a mummified one,
like maybe the skin,

479
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:27,130
uh,
the skin had enough iron content in it 

480
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:30,511
and the soil to preserve the soft tissue
of the skin and mineralized the skins 

481
00:21:30,511 --> 00:21:34,681
that have a desiccating maybe there was 
that one in a billion chance that it 

482
00:21:34,681 --> 00:21:38,700
fell in the right spot and got covered 
super quick before desiccating the bone 

483
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,610
and,
and everything mineralized now when they

484
00:21:42,611 --> 00:21:44,380
go on an expedition.

485
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:49,300
So say if you're going to Montana and 
you look at the Great Western inland sea

486
00:21:49,301 --> 00:21:52,180
and those areas and you're trying to 
find some sort of a,

487
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,950
a fossil,
like how do you,

488
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:58,420
how do you pick where you start digging?
So we,

489
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:00,400
we do,
we do prospecting.

490
00:22:00,401 --> 00:22:04,900
So we know a worldwide,
there's this tiny layer of iridium,

491
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,960
it's the Alvarez layer where the iridium
was deposited on the planet within the 

492
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:11,470
Shiksa Lube,
uh,

493
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:16,540
impact or that seven mile asteroid hit.
The Yucatan peninsula blew everything 

494
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,530
out of killed.
Everything that you know,

495
00:22:17,531 --> 00:22:20,020
in conjunction with bulk volcanism and 
all that.

496
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:25,270
But first we look at that because we 
know that's 65 and a half,

497
00:22:25,271 --> 00:22:26,140
60,
you know,

498
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,520
65 point 6 million years ago.
So we go below that.

499
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:34,030
We look in places,
we've already found stuff.

500
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:39,480
We go to a quarries and a previous dig 
sites and previous locations,

501
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:42,940
uh,
that we found fossils and we set up camp

502
00:22:42,941 --> 00:22:47,941
and we just start spreading out and you 
walk and look down sometimes for days 

503
00:22:47,941 --> 00:22:48,250
and you don't find anything.

504
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:51,670
Then all of a sudden you find this tiny 
little scrap of something.

505
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:53,260
Pick it up,
you lick it.

506
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,300
If it sticks to your tongue's,
likely a fossil,

507
00:22:55,301 --> 00:22:56,560
and then you start looking for more of 
it.

508
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,430
Liquid.
Yeah.

509
00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:02,610
All this sophisticated equipment.
And we look at radio spectrum telescopes

510
00:23:02,901 --> 00:23:05,980
and fucking things that go through the 
earth.

511
00:23:05,981 --> 00:23:07,490
And we look at,
you look at.

512
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:11,140
Because the best way to find fossils is 
from shit eroding from the,

513
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:12,950
from the surface.
It's the best now.

514
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:15,160
And we find a bone.
We're like,

515
00:23:15,161 --> 00:23:16,480
okay,
sticks to the tongue.

516
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:21,600
It's fossil.
Then let's look up slope and we find a 

517
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,510
bone scatter and then we kind of sweep 
away some dirt and like,

518
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,140
oh,
holy shit,

519
00:23:23,141 --> 00:23:25,360
there's a broken bone,
and then we work our way out.

520
00:23:25,361 --> 00:23:30,361
Sometimes it's just what's left of a 
single element of an animal that has 

521
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:35,940
eroded and fallen down the cliff,
and other times you could be on the top 

522
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:38,860
of horse mountain sweeping something 
away and you run into a brand new,

523
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:42,120
a frilled dinosaur that you'd never 
heard of.

524
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:42,680
Never.
Yeah.

525
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,350
Never Seen Utah serotypes.
Getty.

526
00:23:45,351 --> 00:23:47,210
I named after a friend of mine,
Mike Getty.

527
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,090
He's the one that discovered it.
Wow.

528
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:55,150
Yeah.
How many people are out there doing 

529
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:55,150
this?
A lot.

530
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:55,610
Um,
during,

531
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:57,770
uh,
during the,

532
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,880
uh,
dig season,

533
00:23:58,881 --> 00:24:02,070
which is generally late spring,
uh,

534
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,710
two very,
very early fall.

535
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,050
You've got,
um,

536
00:24:07,051 --> 00:24:12,051
let's see.
The Royal Ontario Museum had a dig out 

537
00:24:12,051 --> 00:24:13,530
in Alberta with the Cleveland Museum.
My friend Lee Hall did that.

538
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,780
Uh,
you've got natural history museums going

539
00:24:15,781 --> 00:24:18,210
out to Montana or Utah natural trap 
cave.

540
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:23,630
There's stuff going on in Mexico.
So there's like a big community that 

541
00:24:23,641 --> 00:24:26,380
goes out and find stuff.
Um,

542
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:31,400
I've gone on expeditions here and there.
The crazy thing is we tend to always 

543
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:34,980
come back to the same places.
Very rarely.

544
00:24:34,981 --> 00:24:39,981
It's,
I'm going to just wander Colorado and 

545
00:24:39,981 --> 00:24:39,981
find a dinosaur.

546
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:42,870
I think we need to start doing that 
though.

547
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:46,710
I think we need to start branching out.
We need to get more people interested in

548
00:24:46,711 --> 00:24:51,711
Paleo.
We have to recover the Paleo job market 

549
00:24:51,711 --> 00:24:52,890
because it kinda sucks right now.
Paleo has been taken over by food.

550
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:55,000
Oh,
don't even get me started on that.

551
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:58,170
Please,
please.

552
00:24:58,171 --> 00:25:03,171
If anyone's on the Paleo Diet,
please stop calling it the Paleo Diet 

553
00:25:03,171 --> 00:25:08,090
because it's not.
It would be the anthro diet or call it 

554
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:08,730
the caveman diet.
Regardless.

555
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,050
No.
Well,

556
00:25:10,051 --> 00:25:11,640
people in the Paleolithic people,
they,

557
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:14,260
they'd grains,
they absolutely hate grains.

558
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:19,260
They cut out processed shit.
Sure.

559
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,590
But it's the wrong name for it.
Yeah,

560
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:23,790
it's absolutely the wrong name for it.
And yeah,

561
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:25,980
just sorry to tangent,
I fucking hate.

562
00:25:25,981 --> 00:25:26,730
No worries.
But when you,

563
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:31,750
when you say Paleo,
that's where people immediately think 

564
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:31,750
like,
I do crossfit.

565
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:35,250
So anytime I mentioned Paleo on twitter 
immediately,

566
00:25:35,251 --> 00:25:39,540
like five Paleo Diet bots,
like favorite retweet,

567
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:42,000
like fuck,
Paleo Diet bots.

568
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,530
There's Paleo Diet bots.
Yeah.

569
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:47,370
That they look for the word Paleo and 
automatically like it and retweet it.

570
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:52,400
What the fuck's the benefit and that.
So everybody that follows those can see 

571
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,421
everybody talking about Paleo man.
So the entire paleontology science 

572
00:25:56,421 --> 00:26:00,120
communication field on twitter,
whenever we do Paleo,

573
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:05,280
it blows apart.
That's why a lot of them are using the 

574
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,840
English spelling now with an extra a.
how's that?

575
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:07,960
Where's the ego?
Uh,

576
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:10,160
after the L.
Really?

577
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:11,430
Yeah.
So it's P,

578
00:26:11,431 --> 00:26:12,450
a l a e.
Oh,

579
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:18,440
oh,
that's like tires t why res or 

580
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:18,920
aluminium?
Yeah,

581
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:23,770
you many was a weird color with you via 
trey.

582
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:25,500
Trey,
Trey.

583
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:28,710
Trey is when people use,
they use that for fancy places.

584
00:26:28,711 --> 00:26:32,100
When I perform in theaters,
I always have to check to see if it's er

585
00:26:32,101 --> 00:26:37,101
or are even theater theater.
That's weird though.

586
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,290
You guys gave into the Paleo people.

587
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,890
I think that Paleo shits dying.
I think you just ride it out.

588
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:49,120
Well No,
I think it's been replaced with like 

589
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:49,120
gluten free.
Well,

590
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,310
people will,
Mark Sisson has a better name for it.

591
00:26:50,311 --> 00:26:53,900
He calls it the primal blueprint.
Calls it a like a primal diet.

592
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:55,140
Okay.
I could see that.

593
00:26:55,620 --> 00:27:00,620
Yeah.
This the Paleolithic connection to know 

594
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:00,620
Greens is just.
It doesn't.

595
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,890
It doesn't jive.
Right,

596
00:27:01,891 --> 00:27:06,891
because when humans started staying 
still,

597
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:13,340
it was because of agriculture because 
they found things like wheat and barley 

598
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:16,740
and Rye and simple grasses and all that 
they eat and when,

599
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:18,150
hey,
if we take this with us,

600
00:27:18,151 --> 00:27:19,630
we can plan it.
Yeah.

601
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:21,720
Or if we stay put,
it seems to be growing.

602
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:24,000
Exactly.
And is like,

603
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:28,590
oh well if we mix the water over there 
in the dirt over here with these plants,

604
00:27:28,591 --> 00:27:31,440
look the plants plants spread out.
It's.

605
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:33,140
It's just one of those things.

606
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:33,570
It's like,
yeah,

607
00:27:33,571 --> 00:27:35,250
we ate grains.
They eat.

608
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,240
Yes,
they eat meat.

609
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:37,620
It's like,
okay,

610
00:27:37,621 --> 00:27:39,870
I'm a big dude and I drink a lot of 
beer,

611
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:43,380
but you know,
I have a fairly moderate diet.

612
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:48,800
I don't over do it.
I'm not like snacking on Mcdonald's and 

613
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,920
Carl's Jr and eating ice cream all the 
time or anything like that.

614
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:54,450
You do it in moderation and that's what 
they did.

615
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,590
They had a different lifestyle.
Maybe they could call it the Paleo,

616
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:02,580
Paleolithic lifestyle diet or the primal
lifestyle,

617
00:28:02,581 --> 00:28:07,230
because think of the lifestyle.
Not Good luck trying to replicate that.

618
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:08,340
It's like,
fine,

619
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:13,790
go out to the Sonora desert and do your 
deal out there because if you're really 

620
00:28:14,731 --> 00:28:19,731
going to do this diet,
don't use a car and don't use a 

621
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:19,731
computer.
Don't use it.

622
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:20,010
It's like it has to be your whole life.
Yeah,

623
00:28:20,011 --> 00:28:20,910
that's what I'm thinking.

624
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,550
Just fuck it.
Why not do the Diet?

625
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:25,170
No,
just go for it.

626
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:26,930
That seems like a lot of work.
Oh,

627
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:32,040
hey.
That one guy did it the year of living 

628
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:32,040
biblically.
Biblically.

629
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:32,610
I didn't see that.
There was a book that came out.

630
00:28:32,611 --> 00:28:33,570
God,
what was that guy's name?

631
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:35,390
I don't remember.
Uh,

632
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:38,700
my ex girlfriend had the book on her 
shelf and I always wanted to read it and

633
00:28:38,701 --> 00:28:40,530
I never got to,
um,

634
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:46,610
guy lived according to biblical laws.
Did not wear clothes.

635
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:49,860
Testament.
Yeah.

636
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:51,600
So no two cloths.
Yeah.

637
00:28:51,601 --> 00:28:54,660
No two cloths like couldn't eat locusts 
and you know,

638
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,000
poor guy,
you know,

639
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:59,380
because we'll Hakan food is great man.
Yeah.

640
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,500
Well can food.
They do crickets and grasshoppers.

641
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:02,220
Well,
Hawkin,

642
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:04,550
it's region down in Mexico.
Molly.

643
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:05,760
Molly is what?
Hawkin.

644
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:06,540
Okay.
Here's A.

645
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:08,970
Well I've had crickets in Mexico.
They,

646
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:11,700
we,
we stayed at this hotel and they gave us

647
00:29:11,701 --> 00:29:15,420
a bowl of fried crickets like it was in 
the hotel when you got there.

648
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,220
Like a little nice little snack and some
fruit.

649
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:18,330
Yeah,
they're kind of nutty.

650
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,130
Yeah.
It doesn't taste bad at all.

651
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,770
Uh,
I served them for a potluck at the,

652
00:29:22,771 --> 00:29:23,730
uh,
page museum.

653
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,170
Uh,
when I used to work there.

654
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:28,890
I did a line hit yet people were weirded
out,

655
00:29:28,891 --> 00:29:30,540
but they ate them.
I did lime,

656
00:29:30,541 --> 00:29:35,541
Chili,
crickets and a ring and a reindeer 

657
00:29:35,541 --> 00:29:35,541
Chili.
Woo for Christmas potluck.

658
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:36,480
That sounds good.
Oh,

659
00:29:36,481 --> 00:29:37,620
it was great,
by the way.

660
00:29:37,621 --> 00:29:39,660
Nice elk cooking.
Thank you.

661
00:29:39,661 --> 00:29:41,770
I need to come over and like,
I got elk for you.

662
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:42,870
You want some?
Fuck Ya,

663
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:46,110
I got some in the freezer back there.
I'm totally down for elk.

664
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:49,090
All right.
Because the idea of that is just your.

665
00:29:49,091 --> 00:29:50,500
I love Venison.
I love elk.

666
00:29:50,501 --> 00:29:52,720
I do like game cooking as well.
I don't go hunt it.

667
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,160
Cool.
But it's delicious.

668
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:56,290
It's the best stuff for you too.

669
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:01,800
Now there's this whole Paleo thing,
like the Paleo movement like,

670
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:05,380
but put that aside like paint 
paleontology like this,

671
00:30:05,381 --> 00:30:10,381
the word paleontology.
It's kind of misunderstood by a lot of 

672
00:30:10,381 --> 00:30:14,491
people and I think that the,
the study of the past of trying to piece

673
00:30:15,431 --> 00:30:20,431
together all these bones and slowly but 
surely put together a puzzle of what 

674
00:30:21,311 --> 00:30:25,690
life was like before people came around.
It's really important,

675
00:30:25,691 --> 00:30:26,130
isn't it?
I mean,

676
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:26,870
isn't,
isn't,

677
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:31,120
isn't a kind of an overlooked and 
underappreciated aspect of science.

678
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:34,060
Absolutely.
Paleontology the study of ancient life.

679
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:38,860
That's our deal.
We want to see how we got here.

680
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:43,920
Like pre humans.
We want to see what life was like going 

681
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:48,000
all the way back to the dawn of time,
the beginning of the earth because it 

682
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,351
gives us an idea of how things change on
this planet and how things evolve on it.

683
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:57,520
The keys to the past are needed in order
to open the doors to the future.

684
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:01,510
I used to say,
if we know how animals acted,

685
00:31:01,511 --> 00:31:03,100
the Predator,
prey relationships,

686
00:31:03,101 --> 00:31:08,101
different ways that these animals were 
evolving and living on the planet and 

687
00:31:08,101 --> 00:31:12,361
how the planet change because of that,
because paleontology also deals with 

688
00:31:12,361 --> 00:31:12,970
Paleo climate,
Paleo,

689
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:15,010
botany,
so like old plants,

690
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,570
old climates,
geology,

691
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:21,630
all of that.
We're looking into the past of this 

692
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:25,111
earth when we're digging in the 
ordovician period or a the Cambrian.

693
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,030
We're looking back,
we're opening a time capsule.

694
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:31,720
$500,
million to half a billion years.

695
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:34,840
That's Rad.
It's pretty fucking crazy.

696
00:31:34,841 --> 00:31:35,540
Yeah.
It's like,

697
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,690
it's hard to like if you're not.
If you don't do it,

698
00:31:37,691 --> 00:31:40,750
if you're not into like astrophysics,
paleontology,

699
00:31:40,751 --> 00:31:45,751
geology and stuff like that.
It's hard to get a grasp on what 

700
00:31:45,751 --> 00:31:47,050
timescale we're talking about.
We are in.

701
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:50,890
We as humans are an eye blink in the 
geological record of the planet.

702
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:52,750
No.
Four and a half billion years old.

703
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:54,970
If,
uh,

704
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:59,230
if you were to stretch that all out,
the entire history of the earth on an 88

705
00:31:59,231 --> 00:32:04,231
foot measurement,
we would be the thickness of a piece of 

706
00:32:04,231 --> 00:32:05,230
paper at the very end,
all of human history,

707
00:32:05,231 --> 00:32:10,231
200,000
years of evolution from walking upright 

708
00:32:10,231 --> 00:32:14,490
and planting shit and domesticating 
animals all the way to iss,

709
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:15,820
you know,
in orbit,

710
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:19,930
all of that piece of paper at the end of
an 88 foot long ribbon.

711
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:25,510
It's crazy to think about how much went 
on before us.

712
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:28,570
That's what's so cool about 
paleontology.

713
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:32,320
It seems like the scale is for our dumb 
little brands.

714
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:34,540
It's,
it's really difficult to,

715
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:39,690
to reference it.
It's really difficult to like put it 

716
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:40,280
into perspective to think of something

717
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,020
65 million years ago.
You're like,

718
00:32:42,021 --> 00:32:43,550
oh,
well that was a long time ago.

719
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:48,880
Well,
it was so long ago that people used to 

720
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:48,880
be moles.
Yeah.

721
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,840
Yeah.
And here's some weird mole thing,

722
00:32:50,841 --> 00:32:51,980
right?
Here's another one.

723
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:57,940
We are actually closer to Toronto source
rex in time than transource rex is to 

724
00:32:58,371 --> 00:33:01,910
stegosaurus Jesus Christ.
Yeah,

725
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,140
that'll.
That'll mess with your head.

726
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:07,270
Somebody told me that we are closer in 
time,

727
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:13,170
that Cleopatra is closer in time to the 
iphone than she is to the building of 

728
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:16,490
the pyramids.
Fuck yeah.

729
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:19,360
Fuck.
And this'll weird.

730
00:33:19,361 --> 00:33:21,520
Yout too.
While the pyramids were being built.

731
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:24,010
Woolly mammoths still existed on Wrangel
island.

732
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,780
Yeah,
he's right.

733
00:33:25,781 --> 00:33:27,790
There was one place where they were 
still alive.

734
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:29,050
4,000
BC.

735
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,910
What killed them on that one island

736
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:35,140
either over hunting or a dramatic 
climate change.

737
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:40,290
Uh,
because the glaciers were receding and 

738
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:43,080
they could.
Val competed themselves and if they 

739
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:43,480
didn't have a stable enough population 
for genetics,

740
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,520
the old breed yourselves out of 
existence.

741
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:51,580
Is there a possibility there's any 
species that we thought were extinct 

742
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:52,280
that are still kicking around like in 
the Congo or something like that.

743
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:54,900
But like Paleo species,
I mean,

744
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:58,850
anything like along those lines.
Something from 10,000

745
00:33:58,851 --> 00:34:00,500
plus years ago that we thought was 
extinct.

746
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:05,590
Yeah.
The rattle snakes here in San Fernando 

747
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:05,590
Valley,
same rattlesnakes.

748
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:07,040
Corto the shit.
What's the species name?

749
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:12,850
They were hanging around the tar pits 
with Saber tooth cats and all that 

750
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:13,160
animals alive today we're hanging out 
back then.

751
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:19,930
One of the most common animals,
we found that the pits were bobcats and 

752
00:34:19,930 --> 00:34:20,330
mountain lions.
No Shit,

753
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:22,400
coyotes,
rattlesnakes,

754
00:34:22,401 --> 00:34:23,990
horned lizards,
birds,

755
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,970
uh,
that are still kicking around today.

756
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:31,660
There are species that survived the Ice 
Age because as the glaciers receded and 

757
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:37,160
as the climate changed and as the 
Predator prey relationships changed,

758
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:42,460
it's harder for a saber tooth cat to go 
after a horse or a rabbit or anything 

759
00:34:45,261 --> 00:34:50,261
like that.
The smaller animals that were able to 

760
00:34:50,261 --> 00:34:52,190
outcompete them lived on its natural 
selection in a heartbeat.

761
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:57,460
You evolved,
you know the animals adapt to the 

762
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:59,960
surroundings that leads to evolutionary 
patterns which leads to a species either

763
00:34:59,961 --> 00:35:03,920
dying if they are fit too much of a 
niche or continuing.

764
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:06,230
If they're more broad or more focused on
the,

765
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,570
on the environment that they're,
that they're adapting to.

766
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:10,940
Look at the panda.
If we didn't,

767
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,830
if we didn't,
intercede,

768
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:13,580
intervene.
Pandas will be gone.

769
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:16,160
They eat a nutrient,
poor diet,

770
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:21,190
all they eat is bamboo.
They eat such a nutrient poor diet that 

771
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:21,950
they're young.
When they birth,

772
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:25,940
they're young has to crawl up and start 
nursing.

773
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:29,930
They do basically nothing.
They're very low rent,

774
00:35:29,931 --> 00:35:33,050
low energy animals.
They would have died out,

775
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:37,380
but we got involved.
Should we get involved in that or should

776
00:35:37,381 --> 00:35:38,190
we just let them fucking

777
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:39,520
die up?
Stupid pandas.

778
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:41,970
Figure it out.
Pitch.

779
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:43,650
Um,
it isn't that natural selection.

780
00:35:43,651 --> 00:35:48,651
Why do we think we're so cute that we 
need to step in and because we've 

781
00:35:48,651 --> 00:35:50,430
stepped out of natural selection,
we can now.

782
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:53,940
We have humans have.
Once we started agriculture,

783
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:57,330
we removed ourselves once we started 
building buildings,

784
00:35:57,331 --> 00:36:02,331
we removed ourselves.
We are the flat earth people who didn't 

785
00:36:02,331 --> 00:36:02,331
die off.
Yeah,

786
00:36:02,331 --> 00:36:04,230
exactly.
Exactly.

787
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:09,260
We're living longer and that we're 
rapidly approaching idiocracy man in a 

788
00:36:09,451 --> 00:36:10,650
way we already there,
right?

789
00:36:10,651 --> 00:36:15,651
With Donald Trump running for president 
and all the people that are fucking 

790
00:36:15,651 --> 00:36:15,651
cheering behind him A.
Yeah.

791
00:36:15,651 --> 00:36:20,550
Even the Hillary Clinton people.
Some of them are crazy too because 

792
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:21,060
they're just denying all the crazy shit 
that she's been involved with.

793
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:22,320
All,
all four of them.

794
00:36:22,321 --> 00:36:27,321
All five of them,
including Mcmillan are just what the 

795
00:36:27,321 --> 00:36:27,321
fuck,
man.

796
00:36:27,321 --> 00:36:32,120
I'm voting Hulu.
I want him to rise up and consume the 

797
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:32,120
world.

798
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,180
Utterly screw it.
Cafe Lulu for America speaking.

799
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,430
Did you ever see,
you know,

800
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,200
there's always been those,
um,

801
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:42,980
those rumors of or stories of the crack 
in the legends of the cracking of 

802
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:47,510
gigantic activists.
Did you ever see those fossils and they 

803
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:49,851
found of enormous suction cups that they
believe might have been a huge octopus 

804
00:36:49,851 --> 00:36:50,610
type creature?
No,

805
00:36:50,611 --> 00:36:51,750
I'd never seen that.
Yeah,

806
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:53,610
man,
I wanted to bring that up to you because

807
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,000
this is something that's absolutely 
fascinated me because I know that they 

808
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,330
don't have any hard tissue other than 
their beaks.

809
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:03,010
They're all body.
Is there a mollusk yeah.

810
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:08,440
They're this big fleshy thing,
while the exception of cuddle fish and 

811
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:08,630
ammonites,
the,

812
00:37:08,631 --> 00:37:10,950
you know,
that that had a shell or had an internal

813
00:37:10,951 --> 00:37:11,460
shell.
That's it.

814
00:37:11,461 --> 00:37:12,330
Yeah.
You're absolutely right.

815
00:37:12,331 --> 00:37:14,250
So they have the beak and that's it.
Well,

816
00:37:14,251 --> 00:37:17,850
they've found these huge suction cups,
um,

817
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,290
that were fossilized.

818
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:19,920
The,
the,

819
00:37:19,921 --> 00:37:21,750
you know,
the image of these suction cups.

820
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,010
See if you can find that.
Jamie.

821
00:37:23,011 --> 00:37:24,930
I know we've talked about it before.
I see these things.

822
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:30,730
See they,
they think that these are enormous 

823
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:33,300
suction cups from some fucking huge sea 
monster.

824
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:39,110
I thought the caption on the image said 
something about it via sore emergency 

825
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:42,460
taken up by seem as you're varying the 
bones on a.

826
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:45,910
What the fuck?
[inaudible].

827
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:47,090
Well,
yeah.

828
00:37:47,091 --> 00:37:48,790
CEPHALOPODS can do that.
They,

829
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:53,810
they like,
they like to because they're 

830
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:53,810
intelligent.
Who like to kind of fiddle around.

831
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:56,880
Whoa.
That crazy.

832
00:37:56,950 --> 00:38:00,030
I'm a a crap.
What's his name?

833
00:38:00,031 --> 00:38:05,031
Tony Martin acknowledges on twitter.
He specializes in trace fossils like 

834
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:12,410
footprints and um,
what would it look like if a dinosaur 

835
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:13,830
threw up and leave,
like that kind of pattern and all that.

836
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,050
His books.
I'll get you a copy of his book.

837
00:38:16,051 --> 00:38:19,380
It's fucking amazing.
He would have a field day with that.

838
00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:20,910
I would like to know his opinion on 
that.

839
00:38:20,911 --> 00:38:22,800
I have to ask him.
Yeah,

840
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:25,050
there's,
it's obviously controversial,

841
00:38:25,051 --> 00:38:29,100
but we do know that there are some 
fucking huge squids.

842
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,160
Oh,
they're finding more and more every day.

843
00:38:32,161 --> 00:38:33,360
Yeah.
The colossal squid,

844
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,010
the colossal squid and all that.
I was in

845
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:37,510
London.
Do you remember?

846
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:39,730
Just a few decades ago.
That was just a rumor.

847
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:40,620
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

848
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:44,110
Because we would find scars on sperm,
whale carcasses and stuff like that.

849
00:38:44,111 --> 00:38:45,100
It was like,
holy fuck,

850
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:47,260
what the fuck is that?
And,

851
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,570
but,
and that's the thing,

852
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:54,400
human nature,
all of us especially,

853
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:56,560
you know,
you play the telephone game,

854
00:38:56,561 --> 00:38:58,570
like you tell a story and then somebody 
else tells that same,

855
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,340
I heard it and blah blah blah.
And then all of a sudden,

856
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:02,980
you know,
that was the bass you picked up and then

857
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:05,230
that was the swordfish you've got on the
same trip.

858
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:08,110
Yeah.
What if,

859
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:10,940
what if like these,
you know,

860
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:15,020
ancient mariners,
we're pulling up humboldt squid are like

861
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:20,040
six feet long and dangerous as hell.
What if that suddenly got larger and 

862
00:39:20,651 --> 00:39:25,651
larger,
but maybe they also dredged up a 

863
00:39:25,651 --> 00:39:27,820
colossal squid or a giant squid and 
things like that as well.

864
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:31,000
And that birthed the cracking idea.
Well,

865
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:35,620
because humans like to see patterns and 
things.

866
00:39:35,621 --> 00:39:38,180
It's just what we do.
Mammoths,

867
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:43,620
a mammoth elephant remains that were 
found near Greece they thought were the 

868
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:45,040
cyclops.
Oh,

869
00:39:45,041 --> 00:39:46,360
right.
Because it had.

870
00:39:46,361 --> 00:39:49,510
Yeah.
So years that would be on the sides,

871
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:51,910
would they thought would uh,
or the,

872
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:56,960
the eye sockets on the sides they 
thought were the ears and the nasal 

873
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,020
opening for the trunk.
If that was the central I,

874
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:04,380
because they have big stubby hands,
huge recognizable things like femurs and

875
00:40:05,231 --> 00:40:07,420
Olmos and radiate and fibulas and all 
that.

876
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:10,100
Holy Crap.
It must be this giant,

877
00:40:10,101 --> 00:40:13,180
this 14 foot giant with a single lie.
The cyclops was born.

878
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:15,280
Oh,
that's interesting.

879
00:40:15,281 --> 00:40:20,281
Yeah.
So we have an ability to take things and

880
00:40:20,861 --> 00:40:24,370
just run with it.
But it is rad that.

881
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,870
Yeah,
way back when,

882
00:40:25,871 --> 00:40:27,490
like,
like an 85.

883
00:40:27,491 --> 00:40:32,491
I was 10 and yeah,
thinking of like giant squid's eye.

884
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,810
I always like 10,000
leagues under the sea.

885
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:39,070
That was my favorite ride at Disneyland 
before they did the finding nemo thing.

886
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:45,210
And that's just awesome because yeah,
what if there are sea monsters and then 

887
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:50,071
you start learning about sores and like 
Florida and most of sores and atheists 

888
00:40:50,071 --> 00:40:52,030
orders and all the things like fuck 
there are actually see monsters.

889
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:55,870
And then today you've got sperm whales,
blue whales,

890
00:40:55,930 --> 00:41:00,930
the largest animal on the planet.
Basically crackings with giant squids.

891
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:04,420
That's just cool shit man.
It is.

892
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:09,660
I mean,
and they think they used to be giant 

893
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:09,660
activists to.
Yeah.

894
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:12,770
The.
The real theory is that at one point in 

895
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:12,770
time there was a 100 foot octopus from 
it.

896
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:15,100
This 100 foot activists probably jacked 
a couple of boats.

897
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,070
Maybe that's maybe.
Why would they give a fuck?

898
00:41:18,071 --> 00:41:20,320
We've only.
We've only discovered what,

899
00:41:20,321 --> 00:41:23,350
five percent of the ocean.
That's it.

900
00:41:23,351 --> 00:41:27,190
We know more about the surface of Mars 
than we do our own deep sea.

901
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:29,620
That is so incredible.
It's like we've.

902
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:32,950
We've mapped a lot of the undersea 
service.

903
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,070
The James Cameron has gone

904
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:38,330
down into challenge or deep and what a 
freak.

905
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:40,400
It's by himself.
Yeah.

906
00:41:40,401 --> 00:41:41,120
But Hey,
he's,

907
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:43,280
he's got the money.
If I had that kind of money,

908
00:41:43,281 --> 00:41:46,100
it's like the titanic and Avatar and all
that.

909
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:51,370
Yeah.
I would make my own little bathysphere 

910
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:51,370
and go down to the absolute bottom of 
the earth.

911
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:52,370
But how many fucking people do that?
I mean,

912
00:41:52,371 --> 00:41:55,850
how many billionaire and he's only the 
fifth person to ever do that.

913
00:41:56,420 --> 00:42:00,650
I think the first two people didn't 
bathysphere one my faith to other people

914
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:03,380
wanted to know did it after that,
if it goes bad,

915
00:42:03,381 --> 00:42:05,720
it goes so bad.
Very,

916
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:11,290
very bad.
Like just the amount of pressure you 

917
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:12,260
must be dealing with the bottom of the 
fucking ocean.

918
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:14,360
How many miles deep is he a?
I don't know.

919
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:17,480
It's something like 38,000
feet or something.

920
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:23,020
I don't know what.
So what was the neighborhood was six 

921
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:23,020
miles?

922
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:24,410
Thirty 5,000.
Thirty 5,000

923
00:42:24,411 --> 00:42:25,410
feet.
Oh,

924
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:29,270
that's so crazy.
Oh my God.

925
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:34,780
The deepest part of the Mariana trench.
That is so insane that that's why would 

926
00:42:35,811 --> 00:42:37,670
he.
What the fuck is he doing?

927
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:42,260
So I just got back from Toronto.
We're going to be at a cruising altitude

928
00:42:42,261 --> 00:42:43,340
of 36,000
feet.

929
00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:44,900
That's just shy.
Yeah.

930
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:50,200
So if I was over a plane when he was at.
So if I took a flight over the Pacific 

931
00:42:50,991 --> 00:42:53,840
while he was in that water,
he's 65,000

932
00:42:53,841 --> 00:42:55,820
feet below you.
They'll get them down there.

933
00:42:55,821 --> 00:43:00,821
What a freak.
That's how far he's doing to get away 

934
00:43:00,821 --> 00:43:00,821
from his wife.
So he's doing,

935
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:02,900
he's out there looking for monsters 
manager.

936
00:43:02,901 --> 00:43:04,490
If he did see something,
there's a,

937
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:07,790
a really fucking fascinating video of 
these guys.

938
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:10,640
They are in um,
some sort of a,

939
00:43:10,641 --> 00:43:11,690
a,
a vessel,

940
00:43:11,691 --> 00:43:16,691
some sort of a submarine and a whale 
comes up right next to it and checks it 

941
00:43:16,691 --> 00:43:17,300
out real quick and it's just.

942
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:20,970
And they start freaking out because you 
know,

943
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:26,850
two persons submersible to go that deep.
The whole thing is those have to be 

944
00:43:26,850 --> 00:43:31,301
small and very,
very thick in order to prevent 

945
00:43:31,301 --> 00:43:32,610
corrosion.
It's like,

946
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,510
hey,
crush a beer can that.

947
00:43:34,511 --> 00:43:39,511
That's what happens in everything.
Squirts out the amount of pressure at 

948
00:43:39,511 --> 00:43:40,070
35,000
feet below the water.

949
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,660
That must be insane.
Yeah,

950
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:45,170
it's a what?
One atmosphere per.

951
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:47,150
Here it is.
Check this out.

952
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:49,190
So these guys,
they're in this thing,

953
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:54,730
the tooling around having a good time at
holy shit.

954
00:43:56,930 --> 00:43:58,430
Is that a right whale?
What is it?

955
00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:00,740
It's,
I don't know man,

956
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:06,520
but the bay,
the whale comes closer to the wills are 

957
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:07,160
right there with them and then it 
actually,

958
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:10,580
you could see it like this,
like right up to them.

959
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:13,790
Fuck,
that's amazing.

960
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:16,520
That looks like a humpback or like a 
right whale or something.

961
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:19,430
It's got like the barnacles.
It's Beilein of some sort,

962
00:44:19,431 --> 00:44:24,431
but what a giant animal dude.
I've seen them like a whale watching 

963
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:29,390
like off of St Pedro and Channel Islands
and stuff.

964
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,030
That would be.
Yeah,

965
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:33,350
to be right there.
I've seen them too.

966
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:36,450
I've seen them off of Malibu around 
around this time of year,

967
00:44:36,451 --> 00:44:37,760
right?
Isn't around November.

968
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:40,680
I think the gray whales are coming.
Yeah.

969
00:44:40,681 --> 00:44:42,330
That's like November,
January,

970
00:44:42,330 --> 00:44:44,730
March,
and then the blue whales or like in the.

971
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:46,170
I think they're in like spring,
summer.

972
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:49,020
The ocean is such a trip because we're 
right next to it here,

973
00:44:49,050 --> 00:44:50,970
you know,
and like people that live on the coast,

974
00:44:50,971 --> 00:44:53,370
like Santa Monica or houses face the 
water.

975
00:44:53,371 --> 00:44:58,371
I mean they're facing an alien world and
that's a whole world out there that's 

976
00:44:58,371 --> 00:45:02,541
bigger than the world of dirt and it's 
just largely unexplored.

977
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:05,040
Yeah.
And it's really cool to think about.

978
00:45:05,041 --> 00:45:10,041
And I used to be a diver.
I used to work at the aquarium of the 

979
00:45:10,041 --> 00:45:10,650
Pacific way back in the day.
And even that,

980
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:15,240
just like diving off of blue cavern 
catalina or you know,

981
00:45:15,241 --> 00:45:19,770
walking out into the surf at Leo Korea 
or something like that or doing la Jolla

982
00:45:19,770 --> 00:45:23,670
or the golf you,
we are not built for that.

983
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:27,390
No.
And like I don't know how many,

984
00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:32,450
how many of millions of people that 
listen to your show have actually not 

985
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:35,781
swam in a pool but like put on gear in 
order to survive in an alien environment

986
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:39,610
because that's what it is,
not just snorkeling,

987
00:45:39,630 --> 00:45:44,630
like you like a scuba,
like full blown scuba gear can get 

988
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:48,531
pretty trippy when you're first learning
how to do it because you are entirely 

989
00:45:48,531 --> 00:45:51,300
reliable on this equipment or you will 
die.

990
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:56,450
You might as well be in space really 
just going to say that it's the same 

991
00:45:56,450 --> 00:45:56,450
thing.
Yeah,

992
00:45:56,450 --> 00:45:57,270
it's an alien world.
Yeah.

993
00:45:57,660 --> 00:46:02,660
And the same thing happens.
You will suffocate or get crushed or 

994
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:06,740
anything like that.
If something goes wrong and you're at 

995
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:08,810
depth or you'll pop freeze and explode 
and like you're all the liquid will boil

996
00:46:08,821 --> 00:46:10,680
off your body and out of it in space.

997
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:11,670
It's just horrible.
Shit.

998
00:46:12,510 --> 00:46:15,840
It's this and we want to go to Mars.
Sorry.

999
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:18,440
Out of their fucking mind.
These people,

1000
00:46:18,450 --> 00:46:22,890
I've been marking them onstage.
Don't want to go to Mars at this.

1001
00:46:22,891 --> 00:46:24,330
There's no reason for them.
If,

1002
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:25,560
if Tony Stark,
you know,

1003
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:30,210
Aka Elon Musk can do it,
he's going to do it.

1004
00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:32,220
I think you can do it.
I think he can do it.

1005
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,500
He's okay.
When we were kids,

1006
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:39,530
how fucking cool was it to see like,
like rockets land vertically in shows 

1007
00:46:39,631 --> 00:46:41,280
and like Flash Gordon and stuff like 
that.

1008
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:44,040
He just did it.
Yeah,

1009
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:49,160
he just did it.
It was a sub portable satellite launch 

1010
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:53,510
with a cargo ship to the ISS or putting,
putting a satellite in orbit and then 

1011
00:46:54,121 --> 00:46:59,121
lands vertically.
A reusable space frame that blows my 

1012
00:47:01,811 --> 00:47:06,190
mind and even beyond that is when the 
curiosity rover landed on Mars.

1013
00:47:07,390 --> 00:47:12,390
It flew in,
did parachute aerobraking jen jettison 

1014
00:47:14,791 --> 00:47:19,791
everything,
and then it was lowered on a fucking 

1015
00:47:19,791 --> 00:47:22,961
crane from a flying,
like flying sky crane thing and then 

1016
00:47:23,211 --> 00:47:28,211
touch down and then disconnected and 
flew off in nuclear powered

1017
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:35,460
was descended to another planet on a sky
crane that was hovering with rockets.

1018
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:38,560
This is Saifai.
Come to life.

1019
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:41,350
It's fucking Rad.
It's pretty crazy.

1020
00:47:41,351 --> 00:47:42,490
I mean,
we live in the future.

1021
00:47:42,491 --> 00:47:47,491
I mean,
we've got fucking all of the world's 

1022
00:47:47,491 --> 00:47:47,491
information like,
well,

1023
00:47:47,491 --> 00:47:47,980
if you have an apple watch on your 
wrist,

1024
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:51,130
it's kind of,
it's getting kind of weird,

1025
00:47:51,131 --> 00:47:56,131
man.
It's very weird and all that is only 

1026
00:47:56,131 --> 00:47:56,131
created by people that don't get laid 
regularly.

1027
00:47:56,680 --> 00:48:00,100
That's the only way it happens.
If you get a lot of sex,

1028
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:05,220
like Dan Bilzerian,
he's not inventing any rockets anytime 

1029
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:05,620
soon.
You have to.

1030
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:09,970
You have to have massive dedication to 
your task at hand.

1031
00:48:09,971 --> 00:48:12,850
And it is until the moment where it does
land,

1032
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:15,610
it's probably really monotonous.
Yeah,

1033
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:17,470
I could see that.
Check and recheck.

1034
00:48:17,471 --> 00:48:20,060
And Tesla was celibate.
Uh,

1035
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:22,050
he never.
He was crazy.

1036
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,170
He was bad shape.

1037
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:28,470
He destroyed his sexuality.
That was one of the things that he 

1038
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:28,470
reported on.
He,

1039
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:31,720
he fell in love with some woman.
Now what does that mean by destroyed his

1040
00:48:31,721 --> 00:48:36,721
sexuality?
Whether you castrated himself or who 

1041
00:48:36,721 --> 00:48:38,710
knows or knows mentally had a breakdown 
or something like that.

1042
00:48:38,711 --> 00:48:39,640
But yeah,
he,

1043
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:45,180
some of his,
his own reports in his memorias he only 

1044
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:46,880
slept four hours a day.
He worked straight through for 20.

1045
00:48:46,881 --> 00:48:51,881
You took notes all the time,
almost destroyed his lab with like an 

1046
00:48:51,881 --> 00:48:53,680
earthquake machine.
Weird Shit like that.

1047
00:48:53,770 --> 00:48:58,450
But in the same aspect of him being 
completely batshit insane.

1048
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:03,400
The reason why we're in the studio right
now is because of AC power.

1049
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,380
That was his deal.
Well,

1050
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:07,510
he had so many different.
Oh yeah.

1051
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:12,840
Just groundbreaking discoveries and 
innovations and in his,

1052
00:49:12,930 --> 00:49:17,930
his initial idea to broadcast 
electricity wireless through the air,

1053
00:49:18,311 --> 00:49:20,980
like radio signals that we can all tune 
into.

1054
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:23,440
Like Westinghouse was like,
what?

1055
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:27,370
No fuck you.
If you want to build a tower,

1056
00:49:27,371 --> 00:49:29,410
how high in New York to do what?
Well,

1057
00:49:29,411 --> 00:49:34,411
he wanted to do it for free.
You wanted electricity to be free the 

1058
00:49:34,411 --> 00:49:34,411
same way.
Radios for.

1059
00:49:34,411 --> 00:49:34,930
Yeah.
Yeah.

1060
00:49:34,931 --> 00:49:38,260
He was a trippy guy,
it would have been funny enough,

1061
00:49:38,261 --> 00:49:43,261
a lot of the flat earth Jack asses 
embrace him as like the whole thing and 

1062
00:49:43,301 --> 00:49:45,160
he wanted free energy and all that.
I'm like,

1063
00:49:45,161 --> 00:49:46,060
yeah,
by the way,

1064
00:49:46,630 --> 00:49:51,030
all of his illustrations about like 
warden cliff tower and you know,

1065
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:54,160
wireless energy and all that took place 
on a fucking globe.

1066
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:57,780
It did.
Allegedly allegedly alleged gloves.

1067
00:49:57,870 --> 00:49:59,140
I'm sorry.
I would love to play you.

1068
00:49:59,141 --> 00:50:02,260
The dinosaurs are not real video to do 
it.

1069
00:50:02,261 --> 00:50:03,350
God.
See if you can,

1070
00:50:04,470 --> 00:50:07,030
would probably can't play it on youtube.
We'll get pulled,

1071
00:50:07,031 --> 00:50:08,980
but we could play the audio right?

1072
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:11,860
Play the audit.
We'll put the video up on the screen and

1073
00:50:11,861 --> 00:50:13,880
play the audio for you and you could 
just fucking.

1074
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:19,200
Your head could turn.
Beet red smokes can come out of your 

1075
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,580
ears because the thing is about these 
videos and this is the issue that I have

1076
00:50:21,581 --> 00:50:24,430
with not just videos but also with 
blogs.

1077
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:28,790
People.
You're writing things and you're not.

1078
00:50:28,791 --> 00:50:30,890
You're not being checked as you're going
along,

1079
00:50:30,891 --> 00:50:35,240
so it's just you broadcasting an idea.
It's not a conversation,

1080
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:40,300
and because of that,
you can give off the illusion of 

1081
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:40,760
expertise without being checked.
Here it goes.

1082
00:50:40,761 --> 00:50:43,430
Dinosaurs never existed by the,
my God,

1083
00:50:43,431 --> 00:50:45,980
Eric to bay.
This is the guy,

1084
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:48,470
the guy that does 200 proofs.
The earth is flat.

1085
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:53,120
That everybody has debunked.
Fucking thousand.

1086
00:50:53,290 --> 00:50:53,800
No,
no,

1087
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:58,820
no.
She'll start shows or listen to this 

1088
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:02,441
guy.
Don't you dare mention Owens name you 

1089
00:51:02,441 --> 00:51:06,270
asshole.
Wrong.

1090
00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:26,580
They pause,
pause,

1091
00:51:27,110 --> 00:51:28,470
pause.
Uh,

1092
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,800
dinosaurs.
Uh,

1093
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:35,980
we discovered marine reptiles and the 
first dinosaurs about a century before 

1094
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:37,940
that.
So that right there,

1095
00:51:38,150 --> 00:51:41,600
Eric,
you're fucking wrong lumps.

1096
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:45,560
It's like don't bring your flatter 
bullshit into my profession.

1097
00:51:45,561 --> 00:51:47,660
Now I'm pissed that we keep going.
Yeah,

1098
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:49,040
keep.
Keep this rolling.

1099
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:15,850
[inaudible].

1100
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:29,520
So that's because we can do things like 
look at modern analogs and see how teeth

1101
00:52:30,071 --> 00:52:35,071
are fucking made.
We know if it's a Predator or if its 

1102
00:52:35,071 --> 00:52:39,870
prey.
We know if it's an herbivore or a 

1103
00:52:39,870 --> 00:52:40,270
carnivore,
we know how teeth are fucking built.

1104
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:45,630
Even back then,
even when they're doing naturalistic 

1105
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:45,630
drawings like this,
it's like,

1106
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:45,630
like the,
the,

1107
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:47,950
the,
the Macallan on tooth on my arm.

1108
00:52:48,130 --> 00:52:51,790
It is a predator.
It's obviously a met gala or Megla dot.

1109
00:52:52,030 --> 00:52:53,920
How do you say it?
It depends on your,

1110
00:52:53,921 --> 00:52:56,740
your fastest can be on a different 
syllable if it's,

1111
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:01,800
it's both.
It's not like nuclear and new cuellar 

1112
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:01,800
no.
No.

1113
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:02,890
Because.
Because it doesn't have to use.

1114
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:06,190
Um,
but it's spelled,

1115
00:53:06,191 --> 00:53:09,070
it's spelled the same,
but it's like dimetrodon or dimetrodon.

1116
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:11,480
It's the same thing.
The Gala Donner Megla.

1117
00:53:11,490 --> 00:53:13,150
Don.
Oh God.

1118
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:15,970
You're going to keep doing this.
What is it?

1119
00:53:16,030 --> 00:53:18,790
Twenty minutes.
Thirty minutes.

1120
00:53:29,750 --> 00:53:30,470
Fuck you.

1121
00:53:31,030 --> 00:53:33,640
Hmm.

1122
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:48,940
I'm glad I brought a lot of beer.

1123
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:02,210
Okay.
Okay.

1124
00:54:02,211 --> 00:54:07,211
Yeah.
The reason why we didn't know about 

1125
00:54:07,211 --> 00:54:09,400
things beforehand because we weren't 
doing shit like wholesale intellectual 

1126
00:54:09,411 --> 00:54:13,910
studies of science when people were 
building fucking pyramids and stuff like

1127
00:54:13,911 --> 00:54:18,911
that.
That's why we have different ages in 

1128
00:54:18,911 --> 00:54:22,181
throughout anthropological records.
We have the bronze age and Iron Age and 

1129
00:54:22,181 --> 00:54:25,661
all that because we have to do things 
like figure out the land around us and 

1130
00:54:25,661 --> 00:54:27,890
when we start finding really old bones 
like,

1131
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:32,920
hey,
this looks like a really big chicken 

1132
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:32,920
bone.
What the fuck?

1133
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:34,640
Or this looks like a huge human with a 
single I.

1134
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:39,640
What the fuck?
We start looking at stuff like that 

1135
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:42,550
saying,
just wholesale fucking bullshit like 

1136
00:54:42,550 --> 00:54:43,110
that.
God Damn.

1137
00:54:44,090 --> 00:54:46,520
But that's a.
that's what a youtube video,

1138
00:54:47,090 --> 00:54:49,600
youtube conspiracy theory video is.
Oh,

1139
00:54:49,601 --> 00:54:54,601
I know one person getting to spill.
There's nonsense and they're unchecked.

1140
00:54:55,010 --> 00:55:00,010
Yes.
That's why I wanted to play this for 

1141
00:55:00,010 --> 00:55:00,010
you.

1142
00:55:00,010 --> 00:55:02,230
And um,
a response videos can be blocked by the 

1143
00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:05,240
original person.
They can curate all comments.

1144
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:07,490
They can only allow certain ones 
through.

1145
00:55:07,491 --> 00:55:09,440
They can moderate everything.
Same with a blog.

1146
00:55:09,441 --> 00:55:12,740
Same with all of that.
They control their own criticism.

1147
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:16,010
There's a guy right now that allowed the
Paleo community.

1148
00:55:16,011 --> 00:55:17,900
He's going after.
His name's David Peters.

1149
00:55:17,901 --> 00:55:22,901
He's a jackass.
I'm who's like doing stupid things like 

1150
00:55:22,901 --> 00:55:27,730
all reptiles or mammals and all of these
claims should be in this and just all 

1151
00:55:27,730 --> 00:55:32,291
this crap he wholesale copied and 
article from a colleague of mine posted 

1152
00:55:34,791 --> 00:55:39,791
it,
which is a violation of copyright 

1153
00:55:39,791 --> 00:55:43,390
because he's attempting to supersede 
that work by importing his own ideas to 

1154
00:55:43,390 --> 00:55:48,071
it.
He will refuse any critical comments to 

1155
00:55:48,071 --> 00:55:50,900
be posted on his wordpress site.
That's really common.

1156
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:54,620
It's really common with people than the 
war of ideas.

1157
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,900
In the comments section,
that's where it's being fought.

1158
00:55:56,930 --> 00:55:58,940
Yeah.
It's because it's an echo chamber.

1159
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,010
Yeah.
It's like people don't look as.

1160
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:06,160
Why do people think the world is flat or
why do people think dinosaurs don't 

1161
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:08,000
exist there?
Google boolean search is dinosaurs don't

1162
00:56:08,001 --> 00:56:11,690
exist or creationism is true.
Evolution is false.

1163
00:56:11,810 --> 00:56:13,790
The earth is flat.
Chem trails exist.

1164
00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:19,270
They're creating their own echo chamber 
and preaching to their own fucking 

1165
00:56:19,270 --> 00:56:19,270
choir.
Yeah,

1166
00:56:19,270 --> 00:56:21,030
and then they have a message board and 
they'd go on that message board.

1167
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:23,530
Massive confirmation bias.
Nobody.

1168
00:56:23,590 --> 00:56:26,980
Anybody that doesn't follow that line 
gets booted out.

1169
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:32,160
Let's play more of this because it gets,
gets better because they weren't digging

1170
00:56:42,361 --> 00:56:47,330
in the fucking earth because they were 
all dead.

1171
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:54,620
There could have been.
You didn't know what it was.

1172
00:56:54,830 --> 00:56:57,890
That's the thing.
It's like the same thing with mammoths,

1173
00:56:57,891 --> 00:57:00,260
cyclops.
We didn't know what the fuck it was.

1174
00:57:00,261 --> 00:57:01,520
We didn't know.
It was a massive,

1175
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:06,090
massive elephant species.
We thought it was a giant person.

1176
00:57:06,091 --> 00:57:11,091
Yeah.
When the first animals were discovered 

1177
00:57:11,091 --> 00:57:11,091
in the liberate tarpits,
uh,

1178
00:57:11,091 --> 00:57:15,011
before 1913,
they thought it was livestock that got 

1179
00:57:15,011 --> 00:57:16,400
trapped in there and died.
Then they realized,

1180
00:57:16,430 --> 00:57:21,430
holy fuck,
cows don't have nine inch long incisors 

1181
00:57:21,430 --> 00:57:24,380
that are perfectly evolved to slash open
the throats of things.

1182
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:30,220
And then you started questioning.
So the native Americans and all the 

1183
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:32,240
people they were finding possibly 
scatters of bone and didn't know what it

1184
00:57:32,241 --> 00:57:33,590
was.
Uh,

1185
00:57:33,591 --> 00:57:34,880
did the,
uh,

1186
00:57:34,881 --> 00:57:36,260
did the northern,
uh,

1187
00:57:36,290 --> 00:57:39,650
first people start licking bones and 
rocks?

1188
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:41,960
No,
we discovered that,

1189
00:57:42,050 --> 00:57:44,300
you know,
the science as it figures out going,

1190
00:57:44,301 --> 00:57:46,190
hey,
this is poorest material.

1191
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:49,190
If I lik porous material,
it's going to stick to my tongue.

1192
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:50,810
Holy Fuck,
that's a fossil.

1193
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:53,000
This,
this,

1194
00:57:53,030 --> 00:57:55,310
this kind of just,
he.

1195
00:57:55,820 --> 00:57:57,290
The problem with you,
Eric,

1196
00:57:57,710 --> 00:58:01,310
is you are starting from an improper 
position.

1197
00:58:01,650 --> 00:58:06,650
You are starting on a confirmation bias.
You are stating from the beginning that 

1198
00:58:07,701 --> 00:58:12,701
dinosaurs don't exist and you were using
peer of Delia and apathy denia the 

1199
00:58:12,701 --> 00:58:17,390
ability for humans to find patterns in 
order to fit your bullshit.

1200
00:58:18,470 --> 00:58:22,720
And then only cherry pick what belongs.
That's,

1201
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:27,760
that's what,
that's what he does with fucking flat 

1202
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:29,411
earth.
And the problem with this is like I was 

1203
00:58:29,411 --> 00:58:31,751
saying earlier,
because now the stupid minority has a 

1204
00:58:31,751 --> 00:58:32,930
voice.
All,

1205
00:58:33,110 --> 00:58:36,380
I don't know how many million people 
subscribed to his fucking channel.

1206
00:58:37,130 --> 00:58:42,130
Every single flat earth dip shit is 
going to go 61,000

1207
00:58:42,651 --> 00:58:43,370
people.
Okay,

1208
00:58:43,430 --> 00:58:47,030
look at that 300,000
views and here's the thing.

1209
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:49,110
Check out the comments.
The comments he,

1210
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:52,640
he carries that calms down are almost 
identical.

1211
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:53,360
Look,
34,

1212
00:58:53,361 --> 00:58:56,060
86 to 34 slash 94.
Are you kidding me?

1213
00:58:58,970 --> 00:59:03,350
Son of a bitch of it.
I remember being forced to have the same

1214
00:59:03,351 --> 00:59:05,330
dinosaur toys.
Is everyone met?

1215
00:59:05,331 --> 00:59:07,730
Yeah.
That's because it's called consumerism.

1216
00:59:08,150 --> 00:59:09,380
Flatter.
If no dinosaur.

1217
00:59:09,381 --> 00:59:10,790
What's the point in making these?
Okay.

1218
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:11,690
I see.
Good,

1219
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:13,160
good for you.
Go in there.

1220
00:59:14,630 --> 00:59:16,800
Extremely great research.
Loved us very much,

1221
00:59:16,801 --> 00:59:18,950
and thank you.
Max Haskins.

1222
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:23,420
Don't breed.
Don't ruin dinosaurs with facts.

1223
00:59:23,450 --> 00:59:27,350
Fuck you were my favorite animal.
Here's another problem.

1224
00:59:27,410 --> 00:59:28,850
His voice is annoying as.
Fuck.

1225
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,080
Oh my God,
let's play more.

1226
00:59:30,110 --> 00:59:31,370
Oh,
thanks.

1227
00:59:31,580 --> 00:59:32,780
I'm going to open another beer

1228
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:42,280
because we didn't dig.
Okay.

1229
01:00:08,950 --> 01:00:12,370
That's because we find the first one and
then we're like,

1230
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:15,220
Holy Shit.
There must be more of these out there.

1231
01:00:15,610 --> 01:00:18,490
And then the bone war started between 
Ogden and March.

1232
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:21,290
You had the mantle collection with the 
first Iguanas,

1233
01:00:21,291 --> 01:00:26,291
Don,
that was found and they put it and they 

1234
01:00:26,291 --> 01:00:28,621
made these really stupid statues and put
them in Crystal Palace in London and uh,

1235
01:00:30,430 --> 01:00:33,520
Mary Anning,
one of the first female,

1236
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:38,760
the first female pound paleontologist,
and one of the first people to actually 

1237
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:41,911
find fossils.
She discovered the atheists or Mary 

1238
01:00:41,911 --> 01:00:45,721
anning was the girl from the rhyme.
She sells seashells on the seashore 

1239
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:50,170
because that's what she did as a child.
And as she was looking for seashells,

1240
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:54,640
she found a skeleton of an atheist or 
buried in the cliff.

1241
01:00:55,150 --> 01:00:57,070
Oh yeah.
As a kid,

1242
01:00:57,071 --> 01:01:00,640
I think he was 12 slash 13 of holy shit.
I think paleontology,

1243
01:01:00,641 --> 01:01:02,970
twitter is going to rip me apart for not
knowing thing,

1244
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:04,540
but come on,
I'm hyped up now.

1245
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:07,150
He's hyped up.
I'm not,

1246
01:01:07,210 --> 01:01:08,200
Dude.
That's one beer.

1247
01:01:08,310 --> 01:01:09,100
All right.
I've got,

1248
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:11,380
I don't know how many you had before you
got here.

1249
01:01:11,410 --> 01:01:12,760
None.
We get excited.

1250
01:01:12,790 --> 01:01:15,850
I've got nine more in there.
I'm going to need them.

1251
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:17,740
Uh,
yeah.

1252
01:01:17,741 --> 01:01:22,741
It's just so mary anning discovered a 
few stores and once you discover 

1253
01:01:22,741 --> 01:01:24,070
something like that,
you want to go around the world and say,

1254
01:01:24,130 --> 01:01:25,810
Hey,
where else is this stuff?

1255
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:30,550
Let's go somewhere that no one has been,
which means North America,

1256
01:01:30,551 --> 01:01:32,620
South America,
Tanzania beliefs,

1257
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:36,400
all the things that Captain Jack Ass 
just rattled off captain fuck face.

1258
01:01:36,401 --> 01:01:41,401
So Tom cat cafes.
God fucking fuck wooded shit given I 

1259
01:01:41,401 --> 01:01:42,400
don't know.
Just something.

1260
01:01:42,540 --> 01:01:42,970
I mean,
yeah,

1261
01:01:42,971 --> 01:01:45,580
I stole it.
I stole shit given from a trump thing,

1262
01:01:45,970 --> 01:01:49,970
but gibbons shit given like a monkey,
like a given machine.

1263
01:01:50,860 --> 01:01:53,020
I think they're technically apes.
Gibbons are apes.

1264
01:01:53,050 --> 01:01:55,130
I think givens rates,
they have tails.

1265
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:58,710
No,
aren't believable.

1266
01:01:58,780 --> 01:01:59,980
Apes.
Monkeys,

1267
01:02:00,070 --> 01:02:02,710
but not all monkeys or apes?
No.

1268
01:02:02,711 --> 01:02:04,890
Apes and monkeys are prime,
but a monkey is just.

1269
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:06,460
It's not a technical term,
right?

1270
01:02:06,461 --> 01:02:11,461
It's not a scientific term.
There was an article that was written 

1271
01:02:11,461 --> 01:02:11,860
there was explaining that all apes or 
monkeys,

1272
01:02:11,861 --> 01:02:14,560
but not all monkeys or apes.
See if you can find that.

1273
01:02:14,590 --> 01:02:19,590
What was.
We'll go to that afterwards probably 

1274
01:02:19,590 --> 01:02:19,590
because like one of those beers and.
Okay,

1275
01:02:19,590 --> 01:02:19,980
let's,
let's

1276
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:25,040
keep this role and I don't want to.
I want to see how deep we can go with 

1277
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:25,040
this.
I can bake character.

1278
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:26,370
I don't know what kind do you like?
Whatever you got,

1279
01:02:26,371 --> 01:02:28,200
man.
Have you had a goza?

1280
01:02:37,350 --> 01:02:38,580
Yes.
When grady.

1281
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:46,740
Great.

1282
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:53,630
That's because there were two 
paleontologists going at it.

1283
01:02:53,631 --> 01:02:54,920
Against each other.
Going,

1284
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:56,510
I can find the cooler thing.
No,

1285
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:59,240
I can find the cooler thing.
I'm going to find more shit than you.

1286
01:02:59,410 --> 01:03:01,940
It was called the bone wars.
Ogden versus marsh.

1287
01:03:02,030 --> 01:03:03,100
You already talked about this,
right?

1288
01:03:03,170 --> 01:03:04,130
Yeah.
What was,

1289
01:03:04,131 --> 01:03:06,200
what was underhanded about it?
They would,

1290
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:07,220
uh,
they would,

1291
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:12,020
uh,
I'm sabotaging each other's digs.

1292
01:03:12,140 --> 01:03:15,500
They would try and steal fossils.
They were assholes,

1293
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:20,000
but because of the competition,
it's like a fight.

1294
01:03:20,540 --> 01:03:25,540
When you have one dude,
that two dudes that have been training 

1295
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:26,120
all their lives and trying to do the 
whole thing,

1296
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:31,480
the more amped up one gets the more 
amped up the others gate and it's going 

1297
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:31,480
to be a fucking.
Just throw down.

1298
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:34,040
This is what happened to on an 
intellectual and fieldwork scale.

1299
01:03:34,490 --> 01:03:38,630
You had two guys trying to make a name 
for themselves in a burgeoning brand new

1300
01:03:38,631 --> 01:03:43,631
field that just wanted to get in and 
roll and they had direct competition 

1301
01:03:44,661 --> 01:03:45,890
with each other,
so it's going to be,

1302
01:03:46,250 --> 01:03:47,210
you know,
fuck you.

1303
01:03:47,211 --> 01:03:50,990
I'm going to find these bones first.
And it got nasty man.

1304
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:52,070
Wow.
Yeah.

1305
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:57,100
It's like it.
Think of it as Edison versus Tesla's 

1306
01:03:57,100 --> 01:03:57,180
paleontology.
Right?

1307
01:03:57,950 --> 01:04:00,890
Except Tesla wasn't very aggressive.
He sort of let all that shit.

1308
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:01,670
Yeah.
True,

1309
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:03,940
true,
true play.

1310
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:04,910
Keep.
Keep this going.

1311
01:04:08,070 --> 01:04:08,580
[inaudible].

1312
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:12,300
Oh,
Cope.

1313
01:04:12,860 --> 01:04:14,240
Cope.
Marsh Ogden.

1314
01:04:14,340 --> 01:04:14,530
Yeah.

1315
01:04:21,070 --> 01:04:21,970
Yeah.
I said Ogden.

1316
01:04:22,030 --> 01:04:23,140
I met Kobe.
My bad.

1317
01:04:48,110 --> 01:04:49,670
Fuck you for St.
supposedly.

1318
01:04:56,100 --> 01:05:01,100
Bullshit Bull Shit.
Not a false suffocation or fabrication.

1319
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:06,640
Turns out a lot of those dinosaurs.
We're the same species that were 

1320
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:07,280
previously discovered.
So.

1321
01:05:07,370 --> 01:05:12,370
Oh look,
this sauropod femur looks a lot like 

1322
01:05:12,370 --> 01:05:13,460
that sort of pod Femur,
but I found this slightly in a different

1323
01:05:13,461 --> 01:05:15,560
place,
so I'm going to name it a new species.

1324
01:05:16,190 --> 01:05:21,190
Nope.
Turns out those both Brontosaurus or a 

1325
01:05:21,190 --> 01:05:21,190
pat disorders are triceratops or 
stegosaurs,

1326
01:05:21,190 --> 01:05:22,600
anything like that,
um,

1327
01:05:22,750 --> 01:05:23,380
that,
that,

1328
01:05:23,381 --> 01:05:26,500
that is just an outright fucking lie 
that he just said,

1329
01:05:27,790 --> 01:05:31,900
when things are discovered,
it turns out that they're the same.

1330
01:05:32,260 --> 01:05:35,140
It becomes taxonomically what's called a
junior synonym.

1331
01:05:35,770 --> 01:05:37,280
So,
uh,

1332
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:41,590
for example,
tyrannosaurus rex had another name for a

1333
01:05:41,591 --> 01:05:44,290
really long time.
It's totally mega mega,

1334
01:05:44,530 --> 01:05:46,360
no,
regardless,

1335
01:05:46,750 --> 01:05:51,750
whatever the first name for it was,
was technically the first discovered 

1336
01:05:51,750 --> 01:05:56,551
name for it.
But since tyrannosaurus rex became the 

1337
01:05:56,551 --> 01:05:56,560
more popular,
the more documented,

1338
01:05:56,561 --> 01:05:59,650
the more thing that became a junior 
synonym or what,

1339
01:05:59,651 --> 01:06:02,890
or in that one actually became what we 
call no mum obscure them.

1340
01:06:02,891 --> 01:06:06,730
There were the obscure name no longer,
no longer talked about,

1341
01:06:07,210 --> 01:06:10,600
but that's what happened.
It wasn't an outright fabrication,

1342
01:06:10,780 --> 01:06:15,550
it was two dudes finding bones of the 
same species or type of animal,

1343
01:06:17,020 --> 01:06:19,930
but not naming it the same thing.
So that's,

1344
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:23,290
that's an absolute bullshit.
Eric Dubay outright lie

1345
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:36,070
bullshit.

1346
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:42,430
Bullshit.
A sue in the field museum is,

1347
01:06:42,590 --> 01:06:44,170
well,
not 100 percent complete,

1348
01:06:44,171 --> 01:06:49,060
98 percent complete,
including formerly unknown elements from

1349
01:06:49,090 --> 01:06:51,980
any other trendosaur.
Um,

1350
01:06:52,030 --> 01:06:53,420
I believe,
uh,

1351
01:06:53,421 --> 01:06:58,030
a commercial paleontology group just 
found like in 99 percent or almost all,

1352
01:06:58,031 --> 01:07:03,031
100 percent complete dinosaur,
we have found entireties or near 

1353
01:07:03,031 --> 01:07:07,831
entireties of animals.
So He's right by a very small 

1354
01:07:07,831 --> 01:07:09,250
technicality of one or two percentage.
Exactly,

1355
01:07:09,310 --> 01:07:14,310
exactly.
But what he's implying is completely 

1356
01:07:14,310 --> 01:07:17,371
misleading.
He's implying that they're finding his 

1357
01:07:17,371 --> 01:07:17,371
shinbone and drawing an a dinosaur 
around.

1358
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:18,610
Exactly.
But no,

1359
01:07:18,611 --> 01:07:23,611
like we will find,
we can find 70 percent of trend of 

1360
01:07:23,611 --> 01:07:23,611
source rocks.
We know what they look like.

1361
01:07:23,611 --> 01:07:28,591
So yeah,
we will use three d printing or casting 

1362
01:07:28,591 --> 01:07:28,960
of all that many.
And Yeah,

1363
01:07:29,090 --> 01:07:31,840
I'm happily admitting this because 
everyone knows,

1364
01:07:31,841 --> 01:07:36,841
or at least everyone should know.
Many dinosaurs in museums are what we 

1365
01:07:37,601 --> 01:07:38,830
call conglomerates.

1366
01:07:39,370 --> 01:07:43,990
It will be a see a triceratops.
The skull will be real,

1367
01:07:44,020 --> 01:07:46,360
maybe the front half of the animal,
some ribs,

1368
01:07:46,361 --> 01:07:50,230
maybe some tail vertebra or the pelvis 
will be from one animal.

1369
01:07:51,190 --> 01:07:56,190
We will have to use casts of other 
triceratops that we have throughout 

1370
01:07:56,921 --> 01:08:01,921
paleontology in other museums.
Many of the fossils you see on display 

1371
01:08:01,921 --> 01:08:06,690
our casts now cast doesn't mean bullshit
created on the spot.

1372
01:08:06,910 --> 01:08:10,420
It means very technically,
this is a cast,

1373
01:08:10,421 --> 01:08:14,650
it is a replica of an actual existing 
bone that was wrapped,

1374
01:08:14,770 --> 01:08:17,540
made a mold of and then filled with 
resin,

1375
01:08:17,750 --> 01:08:22,750
painted to the correct color.
It is the exact match of a bone that 

1376
01:08:22,750 --> 01:08:27,491
exists.
It is not something we are just making 

1377
01:08:27,491 --> 01:08:30,850
up.
That is bullshit and I hate that when 

1378
01:08:30,850 --> 01:08:31,550
they come in and go,
Ooh,

1379
01:08:31,551 --> 01:08:33,830
look,
fence link plastic.

1380
01:08:33,831 --> 01:08:34,560
Yeah,
it's plants,

1381
01:08:34,570 --> 01:08:35,130
snake.
It's all like,

1382
01:08:35,180 --> 01:08:35,660
well,
yeah,

1383
01:08:35,661 --> 01:08:37,970
you know why fossils are fucking 
fragile.

1384
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:43,660
It takes us weeks to get a single bone 
out and then it is covered in glue.

1385
01:08:43,761 --> 01:08:46,880
It is wrapped in tissue paper.
Sometimes tin foil,

1386
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:50,090
a shit ton of plaster and reinforcement 
is wrapped around it.

1387
01:08:50,330 --> 01:08:55,330
Then it has to be very carefully slid 
down a mountain on a car hood in one 

1388
01:08:55,330 --> 01:08:59,711
time or airlifted out in another and put
in the back of trucks and then taken all

1389
01:09:00,081 --> 01:09:05,081
the way to its museum and incorrect 
opening them and then prepared 

1390
01:09:05,081 --> 01:09:08,470
everything has to get a get left off at 
very carefully and we're adding more 

1391
01:09:08,470 --> 01:09:11,300
glue as we're going because if you 
sneeze wrong on some,

1392
01:09:11,770 --> 01:09:12,740
uh,
on some,

1393
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:15,560
a mineralized specimens,
it goes away.

1394
01:09:16,130 --> 01:09:21,130
It just goes boom.
So you have to work very carefully in a 

1395
01:09:21,130 --> 01:09:23,330
booth with like an Arab writer.
So you're just,

1396
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:28,360
you're shooting extremely fine particles
just to get the top millimeter of 

1397
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:33,041
material off.
This is hard detailed work on things 

1398
01:09:33,041 --> 01:09:37,070
that are 65 plus million years old that 
if we're not careful,

1399
01:09:37,190 --> 01:09:42,190
they fall apart.
We are not going to wrap something like 

1400
01:09:42,190 --> 01:09:44,570
that in fucking steal and put it up on a
mount.

1401
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:45,980
Especially somewhere.
I Dunno,

1402
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:48,230
like Los Angeles where things like 
earthquakes happen.

1403
01:09:49,370 --> 01:09:54,370
It's statements like that that he makes 
are just fucking irritating.

1404
01:09:55,580 --> 01:09:56,600
Keep it,
keep it going.

1405
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:05,260
Bullshit.
Bullshit.

1406
01:10:05,450 --> 01:10:07,230
Bullshit.
Bullshit.

1407
01:10:07,670 --> 01:10:10,250
Bullshit ass a fucking literally 
bullshit.

1408
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:11,360
Fuck you,
Eric.

1409
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:13,580
I'm a Paleo Monitor.
You asshole.

1410
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:18,880
I am actually contracted to go out to 
fucking building sites and make sure 

1411
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:21,020
fossils are protected and dug up 
correctly.

1412
01:10:21,110 --> 01:10:22,460
In fact,
you know what,

1413
01:10:22,461 --> 01:10:25,250
Jack Ass.
I found a whale in downtown La.

1414
01:10:25,340 --> 01:10:26,240
Fuck you.
Eric.

1415
01:10:26,241 --> 01:10:27,620
Do Bay.
He found a whale.

1416
01:10:27,650 --> 01:10:29,300
I found a whale in downtown La.
Oh,

1417
01:10:29,301 --> 01:10:34,301
you talked about this last podcast.
You were talking about how they had to 

1418
01:10:34,301 --> 01:10:34,301
shut down construction.
Exactly.

1419
01:10:34,301 --> 01:10:39,100
You know why?
Because building construction finds 

1420
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:39,290
fucking dinosaurs and and whales and pre
stork animals.

1421
01:10:39,291 --> 01:10:42,080
You Jackass.
Oh fuck.

1422
01:10:42,110 --> 01:10:47,110
Fuck you farmers.
So sue was found on a guy's farm.

1423
01:10:49,910 --> 01:10:54,910
There have been numerous dinosaurs,
numerous prehistoric animals found on a 

1424
01:10:54,910 --> 01:10:54,980
guy's farm.
By the way,

1425
01:10:54,981 --> 01:10:59,981
there's an entire private area up in 
Bakersfield called shark's tooth hill 

1426
01:10:59,981 --> 01:11:01,940
where they find meg teeth Macallan 
Auntie all the fucking time.

1427
01:11:02,150 --> 01:11:04,670
And it's in Bakersfield.
It's on private land.

1428
01:11:05,150 --> 01:11:08,720
Farmers builders.
Recreational people.

1429
01:11:08,750 --> 01:11:09,200
Yeah.
Hey,

1430
01:11:09,201 --> 01:11:14,201
guess what?
A couple of people hiking in Red Rock 

1431
01:11:14,201 --> 01:11:16,500
Canyon up near Palm Dale found a 
trackway from an ancient camel rec.

1432
01:11:16,590 --> 01:11:19,050
We recreational people.
Yeah.

1433
01:11:19,170 --> 01:11:24,170
This happens all the fucking time.
The reason why it's happening more and 

1434
01:11:24,170 --> 01:11:26,310
more lately is because people know what 
they're looking for now.

1435
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:27,810
They understand.
Wow,

1436
01:11:27,870 --> 01:11:29,640
there could be shit out here.
Hey,

1437
01:11:29,641 --> 01:11:34,641
if we're digging a road,
if we're widening the 99 freeway in 

1438
01:11:34,641 --> 01:11:34,641
Fresno,
Holy Shit,

1439
01:11:34,641 --> 01:11:39,051
we hit a mammoth or holy shit,
we found a whale in downtown La,

1440
01:11:40,350 --> 01:11:44,370
like with within blocks of the 1:10
freeway and good Samaritan Hospital.

1441
01:11:44,670 --> 01:11:47,100
I won't tell you where I can't,
but yeah,

1442
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:48,870
I just wanted to secretly.
Yeah,

1443
01:11:49,020 --> 01:11:51,000
it's just part of the part of the 
contracts.

1444
01:11:51,030 --> 01:11:53,700
That's the deal because if you find 
something,

1445
01:11:54,030 --> 01:11:55,920
if you find something there,
you can find more shit.

1446
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:59,400
We found over 400 specimens have sharp 
teeth,

1447
01:11:59,990 --> 01:12:03,390
whale's a or a rib cage of a whale,
snails,

1448
01:12:03,420 --> 01:12:04,260
fossil,
coral,

1449
01:12:04,410 --> 01:12:09,410
all of this because downtown La was 
underwater 7 million years ago and yeah,

1450
01:12:10,411 --> 01:12:11,190
that's.
Oh my God.

1451
01:12:11,191 --> 01:12:13,410
That's fucking bullshit.
Oh,

1452
01:12:13,530 --> 01:12:18,450
keep going.
Fuck you found all the time.

1453
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:22,710
Bullshit

1454
01:12:27,340 --> 01:12:29,110
meaning trained motherfuckers.

1455
01:12:55,590 --> 01:12:57,180
Oh,
okay.

1456
01:12:57,240 --> 01:13:02,240
So it's perfectly fine to accidentally 
find ancient scrolls or silver dinero 

1457
01:13:03,601 --> 01:13:08,601
die from the Roman period or a never 
before known pyramid and South America.

1458
01:13:09,930 --> 01:13:10,920
Oh no,
that's cool.

1459
01:13:10,921 --> 01:13:13,200
You know why?
Because humans fucking made those,

1460
01:13:13,710 --> 01:13:17,040
but it's completely out of the norm for 
some kid,

1461
01:13:17,070 --> 01:13:22,070
some nine year old kid to be walking 
around Montana and find a mummified 

1462
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:26,100
Hadrosaur because I don't know why I 
made that distinction.

1463
01:13:26,101 --> 01:13:27,890
That's a weird comparison.
There's.

1464
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:30,450
Yeah.
It's more plausible defined the Dead Sea

1465
01:13:30,451 --> 01:13:34,240
Scrolls in Qumran than it is to find a 
mega don tooth bullshit.

1466
01:13:34,370 --> 01:13:36,070
Bakersfield.
No,

1467
01:13:36,090 --> 01:13:37,500
no,
it doesn't make any sense.

1468
01:13:37,501 --> 01:13:42,501
He's,
he's anthropomorphic sizing this and 

1469
01:13:42,501 --> 01:13:44,691
he's using a very,
an absolutely invalid invalid argument 

1470
01:13:44,691 --> 01:13:46,140
and a logical fallacy.
He's trying.

1471
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:49,200
He's trying to.
It's absolutely false equivocation.

1472
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:50,700
He's trying to go,
oh well,

1473
01:13:50,701 --> 01:13:55,701
you know,
you can't find this stuff because it's 

1474
01:13:55,701 --> 01:13:55,701
super,
super old,

1475
01:13:55,701 --> 01:13:56,750
but you can find this stuff because it's
younger and it's humans and you know,

1476
01:13:56,860 --> 01:13:59,070
people live there.
So we'd expect stuff there.

1477
01:13:59,370 --> 01:14:00,660
Well guess what,
asshole?

1478
01:14:00,900 --> 01:14:05,900
There's 65 million years of difference 
between humans deciding to write shit 

1479
01:14:08,521 --> 01:14:10,620
down and go,
hey,

1480
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:12,850
uh,
there's a day and a night.

1481
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:14,710
That means something's ruling the day in
the night.

1482
01:14:14,711 --> 01:14:17,650
God's religion and industry and all 
that.

1483
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:21,770
And dinosaurs eating shit.
Sixty $5,

1484
01:14:21,780 --> 01:14:26,780
million years.
You were tree shrews and moles.

1485
01:14:27,070 --> 01:14:29,350
We didn't.
We weren't building shit.

1486
01:14:29,620 --> 01:14:34,420
We weren't writing stuff down.
It's such a false fucking argument.

1487
01:14:34,780 --> 01:14:36,010
God,
this guy's a jackass.

1488
01:14:43,380 --> 01:14:44,160
No,
it wasn't.

1489
01:14:45,170 --> 01:14:50,170
No,
it wasn't because we found a bunch of 

1490
01:14:53,051 --> 01:14:58,051
shit there.
Like dinosaur national park.

1491
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:20,030
Stop saying for allegedly you son of a 
bitch.

1492
01:15:24,810 --> 01:15:26,970
Yeah,
because it's a fantastic site.

1493
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:39,420
Oh.
Oh.

1494
01:15:39,510 --> 01:15:40,660
Oh really?
Really?

1495
01:15:40,750 --> 01:15:41,860
Hey.
Guess what Eric?

1496
01:15:42,790 --> 01:15:47,790
I ran a lab that we had three and a half
million specimens from the ice age that 

1497
01:15:49,031 --> 01:15:51,010
goes back 90,000
years.

1498
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:56,400
So the labrea tar pits the largest ice 
age mammal collection on the fucking 

1499
01:15:57,581 --> 01:15:59,980
planet.
And this stuff isn't mineralized.

1500
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:04,270
It's actually subsumed with asphalt 
keeping the,

1501
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:09,480
uh,
all of the calcium and everything 

1502
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:09,480
intact.
These are actual bones.

1503
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:11,230
When we find a saber tooth cat tooth,
it's the fiscal tooth of the animal who,

1504
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:14,410
which is kind of freaky to think about.
But,

1505
01:16:14,450 --> 01:16:16,450
but,
but seeing that it's like,

1506
01:16:16,451 --> 01:16:18,880
yeah,
we find a lot of shit in places.

1507
01:16:18,881 --> 01:16:22,510
The river of death and Alberta when 
they're digging the pipeline.

1508
01:16:22,790 --> 01:16:23,680
Um,
I dunno.

1509
01:16:23,710 --> 01:16:28,710
Mammoth hot springs.
There are things called death traps and 

1510
01:16:28,811 --> 01:16:32,560
Predator traps in sinkholes and natural 
trap caves,

1511
01:16:32,860 --> 01:16:37,860
and I don't know,
entire sand dunes falling on things 

1512
01:16:37,860 --> 01:16:37,960
while they're fighting the dueling 
dinosaurs.

1513
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:42,960
It's a produce air tops versus a 
velociraptor that was founded in 

1514
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:45,991
Mongolia because of fucking sand.
Dune fell on them while they were 

1515
01:16:45,991 --> 01:16:46,240
tussling around because the hereafter 
wanted to eat.

1516
01:16:46,241 --> 01:16:49,120
The thing at that.
That's a red specimen,

1517
01:16:49,121 --> 01:16:54,121
by the way.
You know what's interesting about this 

1518
01:16:54,121 --> 01:16:54,160
guy is that he knows so much is that 
his,

1519
01:16:54,190 --> 01:16:59,190
his,
his knowledge of the history of 

1520
01:16:59,190 --> 01:17:01,360
paleontology and of researching dinosaur
bones.

1521
01:17:01,510 --> 01:17:03,970
He knows so much I call bullshit on 
that.

1522
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:09,000
What I'm thinking is that he's reading 
from a script that he cobbled together 

1523
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,731
on fucking wikipedia.
I challenged him to go toe to toe with 

1524
01:17:11,731 --> 01:17:13,460
somebody in the business I don't know 
like me and go,

1525
01:17:13,490 --> 01:17:14,640
okay,
start throwing date.

1526
01:17:14,641 --> 01:17:17,520
Start throwing specimens.
I will fucking own you,

1527
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:19,730
be.
You know what I'm saying?

1528
01:17:19,731 --> 01:17:20,270
I mean,
he's.

1529
01:17:20,450 --> 01:17:22,280
He's obviously,
he knows all these people.

1530
01:17:22,281 --> 01:17:23,660
He knows about the bone wars.

1531
01:17:23,660 --> 01:17:28,660
He knows who is in charge of all these 
different simple google search of 

1532
01:17:28,660 --> 01:17:30,470
largest dinosaur thing found.
Okay,

1533
01:17:30,471 --> 01:17:33,830
I'm going to write these three things 
down on this Manila in Manila.

1534
01:17:33,831 --> 01:17:35,650
Fucking understand that.
I'm not saying that it's.

1535
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:38,510
It's impressive in that it's conclusive 
evidence.

1536
01:17:38,511 --> 01:17:43,511
I'm saying it's.
It's impressive that this guy has done 

1537
01:17:43,511 --> 01:17:46,090
this much research but yet still has 
this ridiculous idea and he's using.

1538
01:17:47,390 --> 01:17:52,390
He's using all this data that's actually
factual about how many different people 

1539
01:17:52,701 --> 01:17:57,701
found how many different things and he's
decided that this is proof and allegedly

1540
01:17:59,001 --> 01:18:00,010
in front of it.
Yeah.

1541
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:00,530
It's like,
no,

1542
01:18:00,531 --> 01:18:02,030
sorry.
Over 6,000

1543
01:18:02,031 --> 01:18:03,920
specimens were found there.
Fucking go with it.

1544
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:12,960
[inaudible].

1545
01:18:18,620 --> 01:18:21,230
Why do you think it's called the 
dinosaur national monument now?

1546
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:25,470
It's key up a actually.

1547
01:18:27,790 --> 01:18:28,150
Yep.

1548
01:18:29,850 --> 01:18:31,860
It was called the tiniest giants 
exhibition.

1549
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:41,420
What the fuck

1550
01:18:45,180 --> 01:18:47,680
wrong?
If you find a fall planting efforts,

1551
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:50,310
the plant,
what were the things that they planted?

1552
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:52,620
They.
There's dinosaur bones and they planted.

1553
01:18:52,780 --> 01:18:56,700
That's where the dinosaur bones made out
of like residents.

1554
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:59,370
So that is actually an argument with 
these jackasses.

1555
01:18:59,700 --> 01:19:00,510
It's like,
okay,

1556
01:19:00,511 --> 01:19:04,620
so big Paleo.
The big paleontologist people like me be

1557
01:19:04,650 --> 01:19:05,880
Paleo,
Paleo,

1558
01:19:05,910 --> 01:19:09,710
big Pharma,
big Pharma and big vein and you know all

1559
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:11,610
the podcast Jamie there.
There we go.

1560
01:19:11,640 --> 01:19:16,640
We're big podcasts are an industry,
so they say they not in the black man 

1561
01:19:19,620 --> 01:19:24,620
black helicopter day,
but they as in the detractors state that

1562
01:19:24,781 --> 01:19:28,890
paleontologists like me will create a 
fossil,

1563
01:19:29,250 --> 01:19:34,250
whether it's like a cast or we'll just 
make one up and on these expeditions we 

1564
01:19:36,391 --> 01:19:41,391
go out and we actually bury it and 
uncover it and make the news and all 

1565
01:19:41,761 --> 01:19:42,510
that.
Well,

1566
01:19:42,511 --> 01:19:44,220
if that was true,
Eric,

1567
01:19:45,540 --> 01:19:48,990
why is it that when we find something,
say in,

1568
01:19:49,380 --> 01:19:51,060
I don't know,
2008,

1569
01:19:52,470 --> 01:19:57,470
it's not usually written about until say
2012 and that's just assembled a single 

1570
01:19:59,161 --> 01:20:01,830
note in the Journal of Vertebrate 
Paleontology,

1571
01:20:01,831 --> 01:20:06,831
which I guarantee you've never read or 
it's done as a poster at the Society of 

1572
01:20:06,930 --> 01:20:09,120
vertebrate,
which I will absolutely guarantee you've

1573
01:20:09,121 --> 01:20:09,750
never been to.

1574
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:13,940
And then the fossils still in prep at 
that point.

1575
01:20:14,090 --> 01:20:17,930
We haven't done all the research on it.
It still undiscovered fossil found.

1576
01:20:18,380 --> 01:20:23,380
If we're going out and investing all of 
this money in order to make these fakes 

1577
01:20:24,230 --> 01:20:29,230
and bury them and pay all of these 
people to shut them up and huge 

1578
01:20:29,230 --> 01:20:34,110
excavation is like that,
we would kind of want to recoup that 

1579
01:20:34,110 --> 01:20:37,361
money as fast as possible and 
immediately dump it to the news and get 

1580
01:20:37,361 --> 01:20:39,770
paid for spokesman ships and all of 
that,

1581
01:20:39,771 --> 01:20:42,830
but we don't.
We suffer natural history.

1582
01:20:42,831 --> 01:20:47,240
Museums are some of the lowest donated 
two institutions on the planet.

1583
01:20:47,690 --> 01:20:52,690
Art Museums are generally number one.
There are people that get laid off all 

1584
01:20:52,690 --> 01:20:55,490
the time from museums.
Museums close.

1585
01:20:56,180 --> 01:20:59,600
If we were making all this money and 
making all this fame,

1586
01:20:59,970 --> 01:21:02,450
why are there paleontologists out of a 
job?

1587
01:21:02,750 --> 01:21:06,290
Why do I know a dozen monitors that 
don't have work right now?

1588
01:21:06,710 --> 01:21:11,710
Why are there museums that have problem 
actually getting a budget to get an 

1589
01:21:11,901 --> 01:21:16,901
excavation going that they have to use 
private donors that they have to use 

1590
01:21:16,901 --> 01:21:20,411
their board of directors that they have 
to go from a county museum to a 

1591
01:21:20,411 --> 01:21:22,910
foundation,
nonprofit non profit.

1592
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:28,120
This is such a line of fucking bullshit 
that.

1593
01:21:28,210 --> 01:21:33,210
I mean that.
That pisses me off because his simple 

1594
01:21:33,210 --> 01:21:35,661
statements are looping in thousands and 
tens of thousands of employees and 

1595
01:21:36,061 --> 01:21:41,061
museums and all of that worldwide.
This would be one of the largest 

1596
01:21:41,061 --> 01:21:43,530
conspiracies ever other than,
I don't know,

1597
01:21:43,531 --> 01:21:46,060
Moon hoax is a NASA earth flat earth and
Shit.

1598
01:21:46,300 --> 01:21:47,220
One he does.
Yeah.

1599
01:21:47,221 --> 01:21:48,840
That is a good one.
Keep going.

1600
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:50,910
Oh,
let's get them on of a bitch.

1601
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:05,270
What?
The nonprofit business.

1602
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:25,620
Okay.
Eric.

1603
01:22:27,250 --> 01:22:28,200
Um,
if,

1604
01:22:28,220 --> 01:22:32,790
if that's true,
then why do dinosaurs become passe?

1605
01:22:33,180 --> 01:22:35,700
Why does somebody like me who has been 
on,

1606
01:22:36,090 --> 01:22:37,140
I don't know,
13,

1607
01:22:37,141 --> 01:22:40,110
14 different television shows talking 
about paleontology,

1608
01:22:40,111 --> 01:22:43,830
geology and all that.
I have pitched dinosaur,

1609
01:22:43,860 --> 01:22:47,460
like live dig stuff to bbc and all of 
that.

1610
01:22:47,461 --> 01:22:49,770
I'm consulting on a couple projects 
right now.

1611
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:50,760
Unfortunately,
can't name them,

1612
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:52,580
but,
uh,

1613
01:22:52,740 --> 01:22:56,040
dinosaurs become passe very,
very quickly because people are like,

1614
01:22:56,160 --> 01:22:56,570
oh,
cool.

1615
01:22:56,580 --> 01:22:57,570
New dinosaurs found.
Yeah.

1616
01:22:57,580 --> 01:22:59,010
Big Deal.
Or Oh,

1617
01:22:59,011 --> 01:23:00,210
well,
brontosauruses back.

1618
01:23:00,211 --> 01:23:00,690
Yeah,
whatever.

1619
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:03,890
But the mainstream media,
as you said,

1620
01:23:04,740 --> 01:23:06,240
is like,
they love

1621
01:23:06,250 --> 01:23:08,020
a dinosaur story,
but that's bullshit.

1622
01:23:08,140 --> 01:23:09,670
That's absolute bullshit.
When was,

1623
01:23:09,820 --> 01:23:10,960
when was the last,
like,

1624
01:23:10,961 --> 01:23:12,250
dinosaur document?
Yeah,

1625
01:23:12,251 --> 01:23:13,860
there was um,
uh,

1626
01:23:14,090 --> 01:23:16,660
uh,
what was it called?

1627
01:23:16,690 --> 01:23:20,210
Autopsy of a t rex with my friend Tori 
and uh,

1628
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:21,580
that,
that.

1629
01:23:21,581 --> 01:23:23,020
Okay.
That was a speculative science show.

1630
01:23:23,021 --> 01:23:24,790
It was like,
what happens if we found a t rex and cut

1631
01:23:24,791 --> 01:23:29,791
it open and do an autopsy.
That was a hit and then paleontology TV 

1632
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:35,520
died again two years ago.
I had a knack to our national geographic

1633
01:23:35,681 --> 01:23:40,240
documentary about digging up woolly 
mammoths in that it aired a night.

1634
01:23:40,570 --> 01:23:42,910
There was a little bit of press fucking 
done.

1635
01:23:43,150 --> 01:23:45,660
The production company that did the,
the,

1636
01:23:45,730 --> 01:23:48,790
the thing with nat geo is out of 
business now.

1637
01:23:49,090 --> 01:23:50,680
Just done.
It's like,

1638
01:23:50,710 --> 01:23:51,560
really?
We're,

1639
01:23:51,610 --> 01:23:55,420
we're pressured and to get this money 
then why aren't we making fucking more?

1640
01:23:55,690 --> 01:24:00,690
Why Eric?
Am I a bartender in addition to a 

1641
01:24:00,690 --> 01:24:03,880
paleontologist in addition to somebody 
that's on TV,

1642
01:24:04,690 --> 01:24:07,090
if I'm making all this big Pharma or 
sorry,

1643
01:24:07,091 --> 01:24:10,120
big Paleo fucking money if I'm such a 
shill.

1644
01:24:10,390 --> 01:24:11,200
Okay.
Yeah.

1645
01:24:11,320 --> 01:24:14,410
Is that why I'm a month behind on my car
payment right now?

1646
01:24:14,950 --> 01:24:17,140
Is that why I'm trying to scrape 
together rent?

1647
01:24:17,410 --> 01:24:20,680
Fuck,
you can aggressive.

1648
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:22,780
I'm very aggressive.
Fuck these guys.

1649
01:24:29,630 --> 01:24:30,210
Wait,
wait,

1650
01:24:30,211 --> 01:24:30,530
wait,
wait,

1651
01:24:30,531 --> 01:24:31,290
wait,
wait.

1652
01:24:31,430 --> 01:24:36,290
The bandwagon effect and the crowd 
behavior like flat earth bullshit.

1653
01:24:36,470 --> 01:24:41,470
Okay.
We're only seven minutes and 53 seconds 

1654
01:24:41,470 --> 01:24:42,500
into a 29 minute video.
Fuck all.

1655
01:24:44,750 --> 01:24:47,060
We don't have to keep going.
I don't want you to get too mad.

1656
01:24:47,061 --> 01:24:48,390
I think you Kinda made your point.
Yeah,

1657
01:24:48,620 --> 01:24:53,620
you can pull the plug anytime you want,
but now it's like one of those twitter 

1658
01:24:53,620 --> 01:24:53,720
arguments,
man.

1659
01:24:53,721 --> 01:24:55,390
Now I'm getting invested.
No,

1660
01:24:55,400 --> 01:25:00,400
that's why I wanted to play fucking 
troll me all the time because we follow 

1661
01:25:01,071 --> 01:25:06,071
each other.
We DM each other and all of a sudden in 

1662
01:25:06,071 --> 01:25:07,790
my feet it's like I have you on note 
because we're both verified.

1663
01:25:07,791 --> 01:25:11,250
It pops up and it's just like Joe Rogan 
is tweeting but flatter.

1664
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:15,020
I'm like fuck.
And then just go for it.

1665
01:25:15,021 --> 01:25:20,021
It's like,
I mean like you know the podcasts and 

1666
01:25:20,021 --> 01:25:21,260
like flight commentary and UFC stuff and
like with your,

1667
01:25:21,261 --> 01:25:23,180
with like triggered coming out and all 
that.

1668
01:25:23,420 --> 01:25:26,180
That's one thing when you rile up the 
cranks man,

1669
01:25:27,140 --> 01:25:29,480
you're just like,
you're at the same level.

1670
01:25:29,750 --> 01:25:30,320
Actually.
You have.

1671
01:25:30,620 --> 01:25:32,900
How many followers do you have?
Like 2 million,

1672
01:25:33,070 --> 01:25:34,340
right?
Like on twitter,

1673
01:25:35,100 --> 01:25:36,290
the Tdt,
uh,

1674
01:25:36,350 --> 01:25:40,030
take that Darwin like 10,
maybe 15,000.

1675
01:25:40,970 --> 01:25:43,910
I get the same level of riled from both 
of you.

1676
01:25:44,750 --> 01:25:49,750
Fuck man.
So we need to fly him out and have him 

1677
01:25:49,750 --> 01:25:49,750
on the show.
This guy this?

1678
01:25:49,750 --> 01:25:50,180
No,
no.

1679
01:25:50,181 --> 01:25:50,670
Eric.
No,

1680
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:51,330
no,
no,

1681
01:25:51,340 --> 01:25:52,810
no.
Take that Darwin doll.

1682
01:25:52,860 --> 01:25:53,500
You know,
he,

1683
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:54,880
he would be rad.
No,

1684
01:25:55,700 --> 01:25:56,500
fuck.
Eric Dubé.

1685
01:25:56,510 --> 01:26:01,510
If he's ever on the show,
I want to be outside waiting with a 

1686
01:26:01,510 --> 01:26:01,510
fucking baseball bat.
Oh,

1687
01:26:01,510 --> 01:26:04,280
how do you won't be violent with them?
Almost almost

1688
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:06,170
that you want to talk to them what you 
have to meet.

1689
01:26:06,171 --> 01:26:11,171
I think you could gain a lot from 
sitting down with a guy like this and 

1690
01:26:11,171 --> 01:26:14,951
just sort of picking them apart because 
you would realize what he was wrong 

1691
01:26:14,951 --> 01:26:17,801
about and instead of him being able to 
just spout off on a youtube video who 

1692
01:26:17,801 --> 01:26:21,730
would be checked at every step of the 
way whenever he said something 

1693
01:26:21,730 --> 01:26:21,730
incorrect.
Yes.

1694
01:26:21,730 --> 01:26:24,110
But the problem is the only reason why I
would do that,

1695
01:26:24,440 --> 01:26:26,940
he will never change his mind.
Well,

1696
01:26:26,941 --> 01:26:29,510
he's probably crazy.
Well Duh.

1697
01:26:29,900 --> 01:26:33,530
He's absolutely crazy.
But think about it right now,

1698
01:26:33,860 --> 01:26:37,460
you have 4 million subscribers that now 
know this video exists,

1699
01:26:37,820 --> 01:26:42,590
that no eric debase name that know that 
paleontologists can get riled up by this

1700
01:26:42,591 --> 01:26:44,660
guy.
They're now going to go look,

1701
01:26:44,690 --> 01:26:47,540
if any one of your listeners is on the 
fence about dinosaurs,

1702
01:26:47,541 --> 01:26:48,770
why would you be?

1703
01:26:50,060 --> 01:26:55,060
But you could have some.
Those are the people that I would have 

1704
01:26:55,060 --> 01:26:56,660
to try and convince.
I will never convince him.

1705
01:26:57,170 --> 01:27:02,170
I will mock the living shit out of him 
until he wants to put himself into a 

1706
01:27:02,170 --> 01:27:06,011
chipper shredder.
But I will never convince him the and 

1707
01:27:06,081 --> 01:27:07,220
that's,
that's the thing.

1708
01:27:07,221 --> 01:27:12,221
So all you cycle people out there,
we don't do it to try and convince the 

1709
01:27:13,371 --> 01:27:18,371
big mouth pieces for these movements 
were trying to go for the people that 

1710
01:27:18,371 --> 01:27:23,111
aren't quite sure.
If we embarrass the living fuck out of 

1711
01:27:23,111 --> 01:27:23,420
these people,
those people will go,

1712
01:27:23,570 --> 01:27:24,920
wow,
those guys are idiots.

1713
01:27:25,670 --> 01:27:30,670
Why did I even consider that?
The world is flat or the dinosaurs 

1714
01:27:30,670 --> 01:27:30,860
didn't exist,
or creationism exists.

1715
01:27:30,861 --> 01:27:35,210
Or Chem trails are Nibiru fucking rogue 
planets and shit like that.

1716
01:27:35,900 --> 01:27:37,410
Wait a minute,
don't talk shit about Navero.

1717
01:27:37,910 --> 01:27:40,070
Seriously,
don't,

1718
01:27:40,071 --> 01:27:43,880
don't even do even.
I just had a little rocky knocky.

1719
01:27:43,890 --> 01:27:47,000
We're definitely real and they 
definitely came down and they definitely

1720
01:27:47,001 --> 01:27:49,670
made people with monkeys.
I've seen clay tablets,

1721
01:27:49,770 --> 01:27:53,840
Zacharias,
and they knew they had wisdom.

1722
01:27:53,841 --> 01:27:58,841
Yeah.
And Nancy leader with the implant and 

1723
01:27:58,841 --> 01:27:58,841
said,
oh my God,

1724
01:27:58,841 --> 01:27:59,330
really know.
That's the,

1725
01:27:59,810 --> 01:28:01,490
that's the queen of Nibiru.
Oh.

1726
01:28:01,491 --> 01:28:06,491
So like,
since like 1993 or 1995 or something 

1727
01:28:06,491 --> 01:28:07,550
like that.
She's claimed that the,

1728
01:28:07,700 --> 01:28:10,450
uh,
the Satan's uh,

1729
01:28:10,460 --> 01:28:11,060
that,
uh,

1730
01:28:11,090 --> 01:28:16,090
know about Nibiru and all that put an 
implant in her head and she's the only 

1731
01:28:16,551 --> 01:28:18,830
one that can talk to them.
Imagine if it was true though.

1732
01:28:19,170 --> 01:28:22,160
Imagine you're sitting here mocking army
and this pitch has got an implant in her

1733
01:28:22,161 --> 01:28:23,470
head.
She's talking to aliens.

1734
01:28:23,480 --> 01:28:27,440
So nearly through the truth.
And she's like,

1735
01:28:27,470 --> 01:28:30,320
I've got a message.
Well the thing is,

1736
01:28:30,321 --> 01:28:32,090
they've been wrong.
So she is.

1737
01:28:32,270 --> 01:28:36,020
She actually made a prediction and was 
totally wrong on it.

1738
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:37,710
Maybe.
Maybe they're trolling or.

1739
01:28:37,820 --> 01:28:42,820
Well,
why would they tell people what's going 

1740
01:28:42,820 --> 01:28:42,820
to happen and what's going on?
They don't give a fuck.

1741
01:28:42,820 --> 01:28:47,530
We're like little monkeys.
They're like little monkeys with a 

1742
01:28:47,530 --> 01:28:47,530
lighter,
true,

1743
01:28:47,530 --> 01:28:47,630
true.
And that's actually their argument,

1744
01:28:48,170 --> 01:28:49,790
their argument.
But if you do the math,

1745
01:28:49,791 --> 01:28:52,220
so this,
this rogue planet supposedly has like a,

1746
01:28:52,221 --> 01:28:54,440
um,
an orbital period of 3,600

1747
01:28:54,441 --> 01:28:59,441
years and it goes out.
It was like 50 a year or something like 

1748
01:28:59,441 --> 01:29:00,660
50 distances from the earth to the sun.
Um,

1749
01:29:01,020 --> 01:29:03,000
yeah,
the orbital velocity of that would be an

1750
01:29:03,001 --> 01:29:05,310
excess of 42 point one kilometers a 
second,

1751
01:29:05,311 --> 01:29:07,410
which is the escape velocity of the 
solar system.

1752
01:29:08,070 --> 01:29:12,000
Any sort of gravitational pull to a 
protuberance that,

1753
01:29:12,050 --> 01:29:13,300
uh,
or A.

1754
01:29:13,300 --> 01:29:18,300
Sorry,
a problem that would have as it 

1755
01:29:18,300 --> 01:29:18,300
approached,
I don't know,

1756
01:29:18,300 --> 01:29:19,160
Pluto or the uh,
or the Qb,

1757
01:29:19,161 --> 01:29:21,720
a belt or anything,
the oort cloud or anything like that.

1758
01:29:22,050 --> 01:29:27,050
The slightest bit of gravitation would 
launch it out of the solar system on a 

1759
01:29:27,050 --> 01:29:28,080
who the fuck knows where it's going?
Trajectory.

1760
01:29:28,830 --> 01:29:33,830
There's no way a planet the size of 
fucking Neptune is cruising in and right

1761
01:29:34,591 --> 01:29:39,591
behind the sun on a counter orbit to us.
So according to them,

1762
01:29:41,820 --> 01:29:44,310
the earth has stopped rotating.
It has stopped,

1763
01:29:44,340 --> 01:29:46,800
orbiting is now just wobbling back and 
forth.

1764
01:29:46,980 --> 01:29:50,700
And there's going to be a physical pole 
shift of the fucking planet.

1765
01:29:50,820 --> 01:29:52,050
Oh,
this lady,

1766
01:29:52,180 --> 01:29:52,850
this.
Yeah.

1767
01:29:52,860 --> 01:29:55,500
This is the Nancy Shit.
There is a planet.

1768
01:29:55,560 --> 01:30:00,560
There's something that they found that 
it's outside the Kuyper belt right 

1769
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:00,560
there.
There is some thing,

1770
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:04,080
some object that they believe is four 
times plus larger than the earth.

1771
01:30:04,110 --> 01:30:08,280
That is because of a outer orbits of 
outer material.

1772
01:30:08,490 --> 01:30:13,490
Wiggles just a little bit.
Whether it's a twin son or a dark star 

1773
01:30:13,490 --> 01:30:16,680
or a neptune size planet or anything 
like that.

1774
01:30:17,100 --> 01:30:19,650
We don't know.
That is all speculation,

1775
01:30:19,720 --> 01:30:24,720
right?
It's like I'm going to jpl next 

1776
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:25,260
Wednesday for a tour and talking to 
people.

1777
01:30:26,100 --> 01:30:30,060
It's that no one knows because no one's 
discovered the whole planet x thing.

1778
01:30:30,061 --> 01:30:31,410
Everyone's like planning.
An ex was discovered.

1779
01:30:31,411 --> 01:30:36,411
No,
it wasn't for planet nine or whatever 

1780
01:30:36,411 --> 01:30:36,411
the fuck they're calling it now.
It was not discovered.

1781
01:30:36,411 --> 01:30:41,270
It was theorized.
There's a huge difference between 

1782
01:30:41,270 --> 01:30:41,550
hypothesis,
a theory and a discovery.

1783
01:30:41,630 --> 01:30:43,170
I hypothesis of,
Hey,

1784
01:30:43,320 --> 01:30:45,660
shits wiggling.
That means something may be out there.

1785
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:46,950
A theory is,
hey,

1786
01:30:47,070 --> 01:30:48,990
we found something.
We have the facts to back it up.

1787
01:30:48,991 --> 01:30:52,140
We are establishing a scientific theory 
in between those.

1788
01:30:52,200 --> 01:30:54,480
You have the discovery of,
fuck,

1789
01:30:54,540 --> 01:30:56,550
we have an image of the planet,
or Hey,

1790
01:30:56,551 --> 01:31:01,551
we see it translating something.
It's like right now it's just a theory.

1791
01:31:01,801 --> 01:31:03,120
There's no image of it,
but they.

1792
01:31:03,210 --> 01:31:04,200
It's just a hypothesis.

1793
01:31:04,200 --> 01:31:09,200
Is that even a theory?
They also know that the way that the 

1794
01:31:09,200 --> 01:31:10,770
Kuyper belt responds and then the 
galactic shelf,

1795
01:31:10,771 --> 01:31:15,771
the way it ends,
it seems to indicate something of a 

1796
01:31:15,771 --> 01:31:15,771
large mass.
It's outside their absolutely 30.

1797
01:31:15,771 --> 01:31:19,170
They think it's some insane or have it 
like a 33,000

1798
01:31:19,171 --> 01:31:21,870
year orbit.
I believe it was not a 3,600

1799
01:31:21,871 --> 01:31:23,580
years,
so it's really,

1800
01:31:23,581 --> 01:31:27,840
really far away and it's really,
really far away and it's not.

1801
01:31:27,990 --> 01:31:32,990
It wouldn't be a binary system because 
nothing's like figuring through who 

1802
01:31:32,990 --> 01:31:34,230
knows.
Maybe halley's comet is.

1803
01:31:34,260 --> 01:31:36,570
Maybe maybe just maybe,
I don't know.

1804
01:31:36,571 --> 01:31:40,440
I'm not an astrophysicist.
Maybe on its 75 year trajectory.

1805
01:31:40,441 --> 01:31:45,441
It's flying so fast.
It goes all the way out and flings 

1806
01:31:45,441 --> 01:31:45,900
around and comes back.
Who knows him?

1807
01:31:46,470 --> 01:31:47,720
Well,
jpl and guys like.

1808
01:31:47,721 --> 01:31:49,620
I'll ask Fred on what?
What are you doing Wednesday morning?

1809
01:31:49,621 --> 01:31:50,520
By the way,
I dunno,

1810
01:31:50,610 --> 01:31:52,950
we'll talk about it after the show.
I might be going on with you.

1811
01:31:52,980 --> 01:31:54,240
Right on.
I'll be fun.

1812
01:31:54,270 --> 01:31:56,940
Yeah.
Private tour of jpl photo.

1813
01:31:57,360 --> 01:32:00,170
That'd be exciting.
I know the photographer does sign

1814
01:32:00,190 --> 01:32:02,780
shit about so I won't tell them about 
fake dinosaurs and shit.

1815
01:32:04,150 --> 01:32:06,190
Probably have to be a shell for the flat
earth.

1816
01:32:06,350 --> 01:32:07,870
Depends if we go in the clean room or 
not.

1817
01:32:07,890 --> 01:32:12,520
Or see the see the Mars yard where they 
fake the curiosity rover.

1818
01:32:12,910 --> 01:32:14,620
I have a friend who doesn't believe in 
satellites.

1819
01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:18,220
Satellites are low flying planes.
Have you seen that one?

1820
01:32:18,450 --> 01:32:19,130
Had He?
Probably.

1821
01:32:20,450 --> 01:32:21,260
Either way.
Eddie.

1822
01:32:21,460 --> 01:32:26,460
Guess what?
I brought a chemistry chem trails 

1823
01:32:26,460 --> 01:32:26,890
sticker for you too buddy.
He's still,

1824
01:32:27,010 --> 01:32:29,140
he's still,
he hangs onto that Kim Trojan one heart.

1825
01:32:29,380 --> 01:32:30,040
So,
uh,

1826
01:32:30,130 --> 01:32:32,170
my friend,
I was in Atlanta for a,

1827
01:32:32,220 --> 01:32:35,320
for a convention and my friend Tommy 
listens to your podcast,

1828
01:32:35,330 --> 01:32:37,600
just he's got,
he's got the uh,

1829
01:32:37,730 --> 01:32:41,230
the awakened primate tattoo.
I think I sent you a text with a picture

1830
01:32:41,231 --> 01:32:41,890
on it.
Okay,

1831
01:32:41,891 --> 01:32:42,200
cool.
Like,

1832
01:32:42,250 --> 01:32:44,860
um,
he's like a really cool dude.

1833
01:32:44,950 --> 01:32:45,790
And he's like,
dude,

1834
01:32:45,791 --> 01:32:47,440
did you hear the Eddie Bravo broadcast?

1835
01:32:47,580 --> 01:32:48,190
Like,
no,

1836
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:49,510
he's,
he doesn't believe in science,

1837
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:51,820
he doesn't believe in dinosaurs going 
fucking chem trail.

1838
01:32:52,390 --> 01:32:55,210
What are you talking about?
So we're just defense.

1839
01:32:55,211 --> 01:32:56,650
He was quite drunk.
Oh yeah,

1840
01:32:57,100 --> 01:32:59,200
I get that.
But,

1841
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:04,440
but you get kind of loose and you know,
your inhibitions get down when he gets 

1842
01:33:05,321 --> 01:33:08,300
excited about secrets.
Yeah.

1843
01:33:08,320 --> 01:33:11,980
He gets excited about secret societies 
and,

1844
01:33:12,010 --> 01:33:12,550
and,
and,

1845
01:33:12,610 --> 01:33:17,610
and these conspiracies and this idea is 
very attractive to him that dinosaurs 

1846
01:33:18,490 --> 01:33:21,470
aren't real and it's all been a scam.
They been lying.

1847
01:33:21,471 --> 01:33:23,890
It was bro.
He doesn't believe in science because he

1848
01:33:23,891 --> 01:33:25,450
can't do it.
Stuff like that.

1849
01:33:25,590 --> 01:33:26,410
Well,
it's just,

1850
01:33:26,440 --> 01:33:31,440
it's a,
it's a pattern of thinking that's 

1851
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:33,721
attractive to a lot of people.
There's a pattern of thinking that 

1852
01:33:33,721 --> 01:33:33,721
you're going to uncover some hidden 
truths.

1853
01:33:33,721 --> 01:33:35,680
Yeah,
because you can be that person.

1854
01:33:35,681 --> 01:33:37,780
You can be that famous person.
It's like,

1855
01:33:37,810 --> 01:33:42,810
hey everybody,
guess what happened to Geraldo when you 

1856
01:33:42,810 --> 01:33:42,810
opened Al Capone's vault?

1857
01:33:42,810 --> 01:33:43,090
Anybody remember that?
Yeah.

1858
01:33:43,091 --> 01:33:46,600
Well that was a chance he took the same 
thing or opening,

1859
01:33:46,601 --> 01:33:49,780
but that's what you mean.
Not really because Al Capone's vault was

1860
01:33:49,781 --> 01:33:51,910
a real vault.
Who knows?

1861
01:33:51,911 --> 01:33:54,880
He could have gone in there and then it 
could have been something innocuous like

1862
01:33:54,881 --> 01:33:57,910
old whiskey or that could have been 
something cool like a murder weapon,

1863
01:33:58,510 --> 01:34:01,840
who knows,
but but it's along the same lines as you

1864
01:34:01,841 --> 01:34:03,460
want to be.
Just like scientists.

1865
01:34:03,880 --> 01:34:08,880
We want to find something that's never 
been found before and name it after 

1866
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:12,271
ourselves or a loved one or really cool 
scientists of the past and discover a 

1867
01:34:12,271 --> 01:34:15,310
new species or discover new planet or 
send a fucking rocket to Mars.

1868
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:20,560
We want to do that too,
but it's when you get into the idea of I

1869
01:34:20,561 --> 01:34:24,040
want to do that and I want to take them 
down.

1870
01:34:24,790 --> 01:34:29,790
That's when we have the problem because 
you're not using and everybody wants to 

1871
01:34:30,791 --> 01:34:32,680
say that they're critical thinkers and 
all that.

1872
01:34:32,681 --> 01:34:34,660
You're not.
You really aren't.

1873
01:34:34,690 --> 01:34:38,230
I'm sorry.
Any of Joe's listeners that think of any

1874
01:34:38,231 --> 01:34:40,390
of this shit.
You're not doing critical thinking.

1875
01:34:40,840 --> 01:34:45,340
You're cherry picking your finding 
patterns to fit your model.

1876
01:34:45,820 --> 01:34:50,380
You're not looking at countries science.
You're not looking at simple,

1877
01:34:50,680 --> 01:34:55,680
simple proof of curvature.
You're not looking at the fact that 

1878
01:34:55,680 --> 01:34:58,130
museums exist and we have nurse or flat,

1879
01:34:58,130 --> 01:35:02,370
but it's Kinda like got like a hump.
I think that's the thing that's a little

1880
01:35:02,420 --> 01:35:07,420
bit of a hump to get over.
I would like to make a very public 

1881
01:35:07,420 --> 01:35:09,611
challenge that any flat Arthur advocate,
if you show me a photo of polaris with a

1882
01:35:12,910 --> 01:35:16,100
timestamp and gps coordinates of 
Australia,

1883
01:35:17,300 --> 01:35:19,430
I'll believe flatter.
What does that mean?

1884
01:35:19,610 --> 01:35:23,420
So Polaris is the northern star.
We think about a flat earth.

1885
01:35:23,480 --> 01:35:26,420
Okay.
North Pole here flatter if ice wall,

1886
01:35:26,421 --> 01:35:26,990
blah blah,
blah.

1887
01:35:26,991 --> 01:35:31,991
Got It.
Players would be directly above the 

1888
01:35:31,991 --> 01:35:31,991
North Pole.
Australia be over here.

1889
01:35:32,510 --> 01:35:37,510
Okay.
It would be able to look up and see 

1890
01:35:37,510 --> 01:35:37,550
Polaris at night all the fucking time.
It was flat.

1891
01:35:37,630 --> 01:35:42,630
It was flat because it's a globe because
it's round and the polls are doing this 

1892
01:35:44,120 --> 01:35:45,290
places up here.
Hey,

1893
01:35:45,291 --> 01:35:50,291
guess what?
You can't see through the fucking earth 

1894
01:35:50,291 --> 01:35:50,291
and see Polaris.
What is this Jamie?

1895
01:35:50,291 --> 01:35:54,080
A version of the flat earth that 
[inaudible] they think my hus,

1896
01:35:54,081 --> 01:35:58,090
they one of the flatter theories.
So this is what they think it is.

1897
01:35:58,091 --> 01:35:59,900
Is the metal.
Yeah.

1898
01:35:59,901 --> 01:36:01,580
And the,
the go further out.

1899
01:36:01,610 --> 01:36:04,880
It's a scoop.
So why would it be like a cigar ashtray?

1900
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:10,920
This is what it is.
Like a cigar ashtray that's floating in 

1901
01:36:10,920 --> 01:36:10,920
the sky.
That's,

1902
01:36:10,920 --> 01:36:14,570
that's based on biblical.
Because you have the quote unquote four 

1903
01:36:14,570 --> 01:36:14,570
corners of the earth have held aloft by 
angels.

1904
01:36:14,570 --> 01:36:17,420
And your notion is through space.
Totally logical.

1905
01:36:17,450 --> 01:36:18,450
Yeah.
I.

1906
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:22,520
Whereas the penguins above or below.
All around.

1907
01:36:22,820 --> 01:36:27,820
All around.
But other than the north or the South 

1908
01:36:27,820 --> 01:36:27,820
Pole,
that's the problem.

1909
01:36:27,820 --> 01:36:28,480
So yeah.
Um,

1910
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:30,830
pull up.
Oh,

1911
01:36:30,831 --> 01:36:31,910
that's what it looks like.
That.

1912
01:36:31,911 --> 01:36:34,130
That's one of them.
That's cool.

1913
01:36:34,190 --> 01:36:36,030
That's a good one.
That's a fun one.

1914
01:36:36,260 --> 01:36:38,600
Turtles all the way down.
It looks like a chocolate chip.

1915
01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:39,110
Yeah.

1916
01:36:39,200 --> 01:36:41,120
Oh yeah.
Okay.

1917
01:36:41,180 --> 01:36:41,560
Yeah.
Cool.

1918
01:36:41,710 --> 01:36:43,080
So I wonder what.
So.

1919
01:36:43,150 --> 01:36:45,020
Okay.
Flat earthers what's on the other side?

1920
01:36:46,190 --> 01:36:51,190
How come we can actually.
And they say no flights over the South 

1921
01:36:51,190 --> 01:36:54,760
Pole.
Bullshit there are there absolutely 

1922
01:36:54,760 --> 01:36:57,131
flights over the ice continent.
It's like none of the travel times of 

1923
01:36:57,131 --> 01:36:59,780
aircraft work on a flat earth.
But is it disturbing to you?

1924
01:36:59,790 --> 01:37:04,610
Because it's disturbing to me that this 
was not an issue three years ago.

1925
01:37:04,660 --> 01:37:06,560
You never heard about this three years 
ago.

1926
01:37:06,810 --> 01:37:08,600
Then all of a sudden,
out of nowhere,

1927
01:37:08,720 --> 01:37:11,780
there's a bunch of people that I get.
If I say,

1928
01:37:11,930 --> 01:37:16,070
if I make a tweet about the flat earth 
or mock something or put up a video,

1929
01:37:16,490 --> 01:37:19,880
I will get hundreds and hundreds of 
fucking morons.

1930
01:37:19,940 --> 01:37:20,920
I know.
Yeah.

1931
01:37:20,921 --> 01:37:23,140
You know,
because you've gotten into with those.

1932
01:37:24,080 --> 01:37:26,450
Sometimes I do it and when I see you in 
there,

1933
01:37:26,451 --> 01:37:27,270
I go,
yeah,

1934
01:37:27,280 --> 01:37:32,280
I know it.
I know I'm going to move away for the 

1935
01:37:32,280 --> 01:37:32,330
text message of like,
Hey,

1936
01:37:32,331 --> 01:37:33,530
trip,
check my feet.

1937
01:37:34,610 --> 01:37:37,550
I just let it happen to look.
It's up to you.

1938
01:37:37,551 --> 01:37:38,890
I don't want to bait you in.
No,

1939
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:41,960
I think I'm going to have to turn off 
notifications from you.

1940
01:37:43,180 --> 01:37:44,840
I love you man,
but I love you too.

1941
01:37:44,841 --> 01:37:47,780
But it's fun to watch you squirm.
You'd get mad.

1942
01:37:47,870 --> 01:37:51,140
I get it because it's your business 
science.

1943
01:37:51,141 --> 01:37:53,990
Ignorance pisses me off.
Science denial irritates me.

1944
01:37:54,050 --> 01:37:55,650
What should it should?
Yeah,

1945
01:37:55,690 --> 01:37:55,940
because

1946
01:37:56,220 --> 01:38:01,220
I'm sorry.
You have no right to be stupid in the 

1947
01:38:01,220 --> 01:38:04,011
modern age.
You have all of the fucking answers in 

1948
01:38:04,011 --> 01:38:04,300
the palm of your hand.
What's a co?

1949
01:38:04,350 --> 01:38:05,190
Yeah,
that's pretty dope.

1950
01:38:05,191 --> 01:38:06,030
But you got there.
Oh,

1951
01:38:06,040 --> 01:38:09,660
it's hydro from agents of shield.
Hail Hydra.

1952
01:38:09,710 --> 01:38:11,640
You're a grown up kid.
Fuck no,

1953
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:13,710
dude.
I'm Ooh Shit.

1954
01:38:13,711 --> 01:38:14,610
Twitter.
Wow.

1955
01:38:14,640 --> 01:38:15,660
How many notes?
I'm not even gonna.

1956
01:38:15,661 --> 01:38:16,470
Look at my notes.
Look,

1957
01:38:16,730 --> 01:38:17,970
they're getting mad right now.
Cobra.

1958
01:38:18,860 --> 01:38:19,980
Oh,
come on,

1959
01:38:19,981 --> 01:38:22,050
I'm going off the deep end.
I'm Gen x and my license,

1960
01:38:22,230 --> 01:38:23,520
my license plates.
Decepticon.

1961
01:38:23,670 --> 01:38:24,520
Oh,
alright.

1962
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:25,470
People.
No,

1963
01:38:25,710 --> 01:38:27,720
that's fine.
I've posted pictures of the flat.

1964
01:38:27,721 --> 01:38:30,900
If people are going to be really fucking
searching for you,

1965
01:38:30,901 --> 01:38:35,901
run my plates.
Come to my address and presented him 

1966
01:38:35,901 --> 01:38:37,320
with the truth.
Come to my address in East Hollywood.

1967
01:38:37,350 --> 01:38:40,500
Go ahead and front you with flat earth 
reality,

1968
01:38:40,501 --> 01:38:43,320
Bro.
You're a shell.

1969
01:38:43,650 --> 01:38:44,580
You're a flatter.

1970
01:38:44,580 --> 01:38:46,800
It's shale.
A dinosaur shell.

1971
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:48,240
What else?
Big Pharma.

1972
01:38:48,241 --> 01:38:50,400
Because vaccines are vaccines are 
important.

1973
01:38:50,410 --> 01:38:53,510
Big Pharma's Shell.
Uh,

1974
01:38:54,640 --> 01:38:59,640
I'm apparently an atheist.
Chill because creation creationism 

1975
01:38:59,640 --> 01:38:59,690
bullshit.
Um,

1976
01:38:59,730 --> 01:39:00,440
what else?
Uh,

1977
01:39:00,530 --> 01:39:02,550
uh,
NASA shill for both moon hoaxing and the

1978
01:39:02,551 --> 01:39:04,440
bureau.
Um,

1979
01:39:04,500 --> 01:39:06,690
yeah,
so I freaked a lot of people out because

1980
01:39:06,750 --> 01:39:08,080
when I got my,
uh,

1981
01:39:08,140 --> 01:39:13,140
the,
the sticker pack and all that from the 

1982
01:39:13,140 --> 01:39:13,140
team chem trail,
guys,

1983
01:39:13,140 --> 01:39:14,310
I also got patches in a challenge coin.
I,

1984
01:39:14,580 --> 01:39:17,290
what's a challenge coin have like a 
military challenge coin.

1985
01:39:17,730 --> 01:39:20,910
They have it for team chem trail too.
On one side it's the,

1986
01:39:20,940 --> 01:39:24,900
it's this logo and the other one is if 
you can't beat them Barium,

1987
01:39:25,190 --> 01:39:28,200
the element barium that they think is in
chem trails.

1988
01:39:28,790 --> 01:39:29,970
Yeah.
Um,

1989
01:39:30,060 --> 01:39:32,040
so it's just one of those fun things 
because I,

1990
01:39:32,370 --> 01:39:34,320
I like mocking the shit out of these 
people.

1991
01:39:34,440 --> 01:39:38,550
I had an interview one of those guys 
that made documentaries about it for.

1992
01:39:38,650 --> 01:39:41,190
He was showing wow proof.
He was like,

1993
01:39:41,191 --> 01:39:42,930
what in the world?
They're spraying those documentaries.

1994
01:39:42,931 --> 01:39:43,200
Yeah,
yeah,

1995
01:39:43,201 --> 01:39:43,620
yeah,
yeah.

1996
01:39:43,650 --> 01:39:44,340
He,
uh,

1997
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:49,400
he had proof from this lab that he had 
gotten these tests of this water.

1998
01:39:49,830 --> 01:39:50,410
Yeah.
Yeah.

1999
01:39:50,460 --> 01:39:53,160
And the water,
it was crazy because he was saying,

2000
01:39:53,190 --> 01:39:58,190
you know,
that this water shows proof that 

2001
01:39:58,190 --> 01:39:58,190
aluminum is in the water and they're 
spraying aluminum in the sky.

2002
01:39:58,190 --> 01:40:01,020
And then what he tested and that has 
been debunked.

2003
01:40:01,590 --> 01:40:05,860
Midwest has ripped that shit apart on a 
on metal bunk.

2004
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:11,000
And a ID bumped it right there.
And there was rain and aluminum exists 

2005
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,440
in the fucking mentally.
That's what he tested with.

2006
01:40:13,441 --> 01:40:18,120
Sludge really said sludge.
Yeah.

2007
01:40:18,330 --> 01:40:19,500
So I said to him,
I said,

2008
01:40:19,501 --> 01:40:20,570
it says sludge.
He was no,

2009
01:40:20,580 --> 01:40:21,570
I gave them water.
I go,

2010
01:40:21,571 --> 01:40:24,120
okay.
But the lab says it's sludge.

2011
01:40:24,150 --> 01:40:26,620
That means it's an amalgam of.
Yeah.

2012
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:31,230
So aluminum is one of the most common 
things that you can find in dirt.

2013
01:40:31,890 --> 01:40:36,890
So your dirt tested positive for dirt 
and you think that's proof of chem 

2014
01:40:36,890 --> 01:40:38,290
trails.
And the dude was just like,

2015
01:40:40,780 --> 01:40:42,830
just shut down.
I need to watch that one.

2016
01:40:42,850 --> 01:40:46,260
I'm thinking trying to find some way out
of it that didn't exist.

2017
01:40:46,770 --> 01:40:48,930
I'm like,
I'm trying to be open minded here,

2018
01:40:48,931 --> 01:40:51,200
but what you've done here is nonsense.
Yeah.

2019
01:40:51,420 --> 01:40:54,220
All of all of them are nonsense.
They find

2020
01:40:54,430 --> 01:40:59,430
one tiny little fragment of something 
that fits in there,

2021
01:41:00,490 --> 01:41:04,930
fucked up worldview and wreck their 
entire paradigm around it.

2022
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:09,960
And they make videos and they make 
videos and then they monitor the 

2023
01:41:09,960 --> 01:41:13,141
comments and delete anyone who disagrees
with them or they are enforcing an echo 

2024
01:41:13,141 --> 01:41:16,420
chamber of bullshit.
Self awareness.

2025
01:41:16,421 --> 01:41:16,840
I mean,
yeah,

2026
01:41:16,841 --> 01:41:18,730
you're not woke as fuck.
I'm sorry.

2027
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:21,540
I love saying that though.
Well yeah.

2028
01:41:21,550 --> 01:41:23,410
No,
because there is a way.

2029
01:41:23,950 --> 01:41:27,550
There is a way to be woke as fuck.
How could you please tell me how well,

2030
01:41:27,850 --> 01:41:29,080
okay,
look at you dude.

2031
01:41:29,230 --> 01:41:32,020
You're fit as your fittest.
Fuck you.

2032
01:41:32,021 --> 01:41:37,021
I'm the entire point of your podcast is 
you're interviewing people because you 

2033
01:41:37,021 --> 01:41:40,870
want to know things.
You constantly look for information that

2034
01:41:40,871 --> 01:41:45,490
is noble and you make informed decisions
you use,

2035
01:41:45,630 --> 01:41:48,100
you use substances to get you into 
states.

2036
01:41:48,370 --> 01:41:50,170
You are healthy.
You work out.

2037
01:41:50,390 --> 01:41:54,040
And the entire fact when you started 
coming doing commentary for UFC,

2038
01:41:54,190 --> 01:41:56,470
you wanted to know what it was like.
So he started training.

2039
01:41:56,471 --> 01:42:01,471
You started working out.
You're embracing the ideal of learning 

2040
01:42:01,630 --> 01:42:06,630
that is woke as fuck.
You are having massive conversations 

2041
01:42:06,630 --> 01:42:10,660
with people about every conceivable 
topic that's woke,

2042
01:42:10,840 --> 01:42:13,240
but I appreciate that,
but I gotta be honest.

2043
01:42:13,241 --> 01:42:15,970
I secretly wish that big foot was real.
That's okay.

2044
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:19,060
I secretly wish that Nubira was real.
That's fine.

2045
01:42:19,380 --> 01:42:22,840
I will be rooting for this lady with the
chip in our head to be right.

2046
01:42:22,870 --> 01:42:23,920
Right.
But that's why I'm,

2047
01:42:24,040 --> 01:42:27,430
that's why I'm doing that.
History Channel Show Doomsday we get,

2048
01:42:27,730 --> 01:42:29,080
we get questions like,
Hey,

2049
01:42:29,081 --> 01:42:34,081
what would happen if an asteroid hits 
the planet that like the same size that 

2050
01:42:34,081 --> 01:42:34,180
killed the dinosaurs.
If it hit,

2051
01:42:34,210 --> 01:42:35,170
hit,
hit right now,

2052
01:42:35,470 --> 01:42:38,920
last week was the rogue planet episode 
one of a planet.

2053
01:42:38,921 --> 01:42:43,921
The size of Jews have a neptune rolls 
into the solar system on a collision 

2054
01:42:43,921 --> 01:42:43,921
course of earth.

2055
01:42:43,921 --> 01:42:44,380
We're fucked.
Yeah.

2056
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:47,260
Well the first three episodes or we're 
fucked asteroid.

2057
01:42:47,261 --> 01:42:48,250
We're fucked.
Black Hole.

2058
01:42:48,251 --> 01:42:50,380
Very fucked.
A Neptune planet.

2059
01:42:50,381 --> 01:42:52,300
Super Fuck.
What do we not fucked by?

2060
01:42:52,310 --> 01:42:57,310
What,
what I'm worried about that we don't 

2061
01:42:57,310 --> 01:42:57,310
have to worry about.
Um,

2062
01:42:57,310 --> 01:42:58,600
possibly nuclear warrant depending on 
size of the war.

2063
01:42:59,230 --> 01:43:04,230
Uh,
if it's like a low yield one between a 

2064
01:43:04,230 --> 01:43:04,230
couple of nations.
Yeah,

2065
01:43:04,230 --> 01:43:06,580
you'll have millions if not billions of 
dead people like Indian Pakistan.

2066
01:43:06,640 --> 01:43:07,900
Yeah.
Um,

2067
01:43:07,990 --> 01:43:12,990
or you know,
everybody in the state of Israel versus 

2068
01:43:12,990 --> 01:43:16,130
a.
anybody else like Iran that may have 

2069
01:43:16,130 --> 01:43:16,130
some that,
that kind of thing,

2070
01:43:16,130 --> 01:43:16,720
or North Korean,
everybody else.

2071
01:43:17,170 --> 01:43:19,900
Um,
depending on the scale.

2072
01:43:19,901 --> 01:43:23,980
If it was like super powers,
like old school war games,

2073
01:43:23,981 --> 01:43:26,030
fucking Cold War Khrushchev,
Kennedy,

2074
01:43:26,031 --> 01:43:27,460
Shit.
Yeah.

2075
01:43:27,461 --> 01:43:29,890
We're all screwed and yeah,
you're just,

2076
01:43:29,891 --> 01:43:32,680
you're done.
Population falls below 10,000

2077
01:43:32,681 --> 01:43:35,290
people.
We can no longer propagate the species.

2078
01:43:35,291 --> 01:43:38,770
We are fucked.
But if it's a low yield one,

2079
01:43:38,771 --> 01:43:39,700
yeah,
millions,

2080
01:43:39,701 --> 01:43:42,320
maybe a billion people will die.
Then you've got the fallout,

2081
01:43:42,340 --> 01:43:44,860
then you've got the possibility of 
winter and then you have the possibility

2082
01:43:44,861 --> 01:43:47,560
of things like radioactive rain fall and
all that.

2083
01:43:47,830 --> 01:43:50,860
But there's a possibility we could 
survive.

2084
01:43:51,320 --> 01:43:52,010
Maybe we can

2085
01:43:52,010 --> 01:43:53,450
adapt.
We're pretty good at adapting.

2086
01:43:54,380 --> 01:43:58,100
That's the cool thing about humans.
We are tool using primates.

2087
01:43:58,700 --> 01:44:03,700
If I was Hillary Clinton,
I'd be looking to bomb people right now 

2088
01:44:03,700 --> 01:44:03,700
and be like,
this is it.

2089
01:44:03,700 --> 01:44:04,850
Low yield.
That's how we do it.

2090
01:44:05,180 --> 01:44:08,000
Low yield wore it.
I'm like,

2091
01:44:08,001 --> 01:44:09,080
what he's saying,
I'm not,

2092
01:44:09,170 --> 01:44:13,160
I'm not a fan of the whole idea of war 
or nuclear war or anything like that.

2093
01:44:13,161 --> 01:44:14,640
But I understand the,
uh,

2094
01:44:15,110 --> 01:44:17,360
the basis behind deterrence.
Well,

2095
01:44:17,400 --> 01:44:19,820
it works,
it has worked.

2096
01:44:19,880 --> 01:44:22,670
It's worked since up.
And that's the problem with war.

2097
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:24,740
General war works.
Yeah.

2098
01:44:24,890 --> 01:44:27,280
It's not ineffective.
It's not like we're going to go to war.

2099
01:44:27,350 --> 01:44:28,490
Everybody dies.
No.

2100
01:44:28,550 --> 01:44:30,770
Everyone gets diseased and civilization 
crumbles.

2101
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:32,480
Know,
make some advances.

2102
01:44:32,481 --> 01:44:37,481
Yeah.
Only on completely completely lopsided 

2103
01:44:37,481 --> 01:44:40,781
wars like genocide in Rwanda or genocide
and Croatia or genocide in Turkey.

2104
01:44:41,920 --> 01:44:43,220
Um,
things like that.

2105
01:44:43,280 --> 01:44:45,310
Um,
those,

2106
01:44:45,440 --> 01:44:48,020
those are horribly lopsided or I don't 
know,

2107
01:44:48,290 --> 01:44:50,990
World War Two,
what he decided to do to.

2108
01:44:51,290 --> 01:44:52,760
Wow.
Um,

2109
01:44:52,820 --> 01:44:56,330
I won't even say his name a the guy.
Yeah,

2110
01:44:56,570 --> 01:45:01,570
exactly.
Say Trump's name or he won't say 

2111
01:45:01,570 --> 01:45:02,000
Hillary's name,
but he's not yet.

2112
01:45:02,180 --> 01:45:05,280
But um,
yeah,

2113
01:45:05,281 --> 01:45:06,950
it's like,
I wonder if he'll sue me,

2114
01:45:06,951 --> 01:45:08,420
but hey trump,
you're a demagogue.

2115
01:45:09,500 --> 01:45:12,860
Read the Ninth Book of Plato's Republic.
Uh,

2116
01:45:12,861 --> 01:45:17,861
you are basically illustrated in it and 
you are the most unfit person to ever 

2117
01:45:18,951 --> 01:45:23,951
run for president.
And that includes like dudes like Deez 

2118
01:45:23,951 --> 01:45:26,261
nuts and all of that.
You're a fucking joke and that he's not 

2119
01:45:27,021 --> 01:45:27,770
sounded real guy.
Right?

2120
01:45:28,520 --> 01:45:33,520
These nuts.
There was some guy that was named 

2121
01:45:33,520 --> 01:45:34,580
himself deez nuts and like I said,
I'm running for president and all that,

2122
01:45:34,581 --> 01:45:39,581
or like the time q guy ran for president
once and I'm hoping that was going to go

2123
01:45:39,861 --> 01:45:44,861
on with this election is that trump is,
it's so ridiculous that a guy like him 

2124
01:45:44,861 --> 01:45:49,121
got so far with as much baggage as he 
has as much skeletons in the closet as 

2125
01:45:49,761 --> 01:45:53,570
much not paying tax is fucking over 
small businesses that,

2126
01:45:53,780 --> 01:45:56,930
you know,
small contractors that work with them,

2127
01:45:57,620 --> 01:45:59,600
the bankruptcy's,
all the craziness,

2128
01:45:59,601 --> 01:46:01,280
all the pussy grabbing,
all that,

2129
01:46:01,840 --> 01:46:04,360
all that he fucking police so crazy.

2130
01:46:04,360 --> 01:46:07,460
So over the top,
off the deep end,

2131
01:46:07,461 --> 01:46:12,461
crazy that I wonder if like maybe this 
will be the birth of a,

2132
01:46:13,551 --> 01:46:14,880
a more,
uh,

2133
01:46:14,881 --> 01:46:19,881
a more competent form of government.
Like slowly but surely this battleship,

2134
01:46:20,720 --> 01:46:23,430
we'll make some turns because of what 
we've seen here.

2135
01:46:23,740 --> 01:46:28,740
I think so because interestingly billy 
Bush is leaving the today show because 

2136
01:46:29,901 --> 01:46:34,901
of those comments in the video.
Yet trump is still running for 

2137
01:46:34,901 --> 01:46:34,901
president.
Well,

2138
01:46:34,901 --> 01:46:37,100
billy Bush didn't say anything and he's 
getting $10,000,000.

2139
01:46:37,340 --> 01:46:42,340
You hear that.
How is that you donated it already said 

2140
01:46:42,340 --> 01:46:42,470
why?
Because he would be.

2141
01:46:42,520 --> 01:46:44,500
Women were hating them already.
What other?

2142
01:46:44,510 --> 01:46:45,920
Hey Nick,
listen,

2143
01:46:45,980 --> 01:46:47,600
let me.
I'm going to tell you something ladies.

2144
01:46:47,690 --> 01:46:50,070
As much as I deplore anything that

2145
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:53,490
Donald Trump said in that video about 
pussy grabbing and all that crap.

2146
01:46:54,090 --> 01:46:59,090
If I was on the bus with him and it was 
just me and Donald and we didn't think 

2147
01:47:00,361 --> 01:47:03,000
we were being recorded and he started 
talking crazy like that.

2148
01:47:03,001 --> 01:47:04,980
I had let them go.
Let them go.

2149
01:47:04,981 --> 01:47:09,981
I wouldn't check them.
You know I wouldn't check them because 

2150
01:47:09,981 --> 01:47:09,981
it's not my responsibility.
All right,

2151
01:47:09,981 --> 01:47:11,580
and he's talking crazy and when people 
are talking crazy,

2152
01:47:11,581 --> 01:47:14,200
sometimes I want to hear.
If someone wants to tell me that they've

2153
01:47:14,220 --> 01:47:19,220
been abducted by aliens,
they've traveled back through time and 

2154
01:47:19,220 --> 01:47:22,050
their DNA is being propagated in on 
other planets and the reason why is 

2155
01:47:22,411 --> 01:47:27,411
because they're from a select group of 
humans that have existed since the 

2156
01:47:27,411 --> 01:47:31,760
beginning of time and that their DNA,
even though it looks like everybody 

2157
01:47:31,760 --> 01:47:33,681
else's is different,
I'll let that guy talk just like I'll 

2158
01:47:33,681 --> 01:47:33,681
let this pussy grabbing asshole talk.

2159
01:47:34,270 --> 01:47:39,270
He's not responsible,
he's a fucking host of a television 

2160
01:47:39,270 --> 01:47:42,591
show.
He's sitting next to a crazy man who's 

2161
01:47:42,591 --> 01:47:44,630
talking about grabbing pussies.
You just got to let that guy talk like 

2162
01:47:44,630 --> 01:47:49,100
for them to,
to fire him for that or be mad at him 

2163
01:47:49,100 --> 01:47:50,790
for that little heavy handed.
But.

2164
01:47:51,120 --> 01:47:51,810
Oh,
he's definitely.

2165
01:47:51,900 --> 01:47:53,400
Well he him.
Yes.

2166
01:47:53,401 --> 01:47:55,650
Yeah,
but I'm saying that billy Bush guy,

2167
01:47:56,100 --> 01:47:58,200
he does what I'm saying.
He didn't do anything,

2168
01:47:58,260 --> 01:48:02,340
but the thing is I'm the kind of person 
that would check that.

2169
01:48:02,820 --> 01:48:03,580
What'd you?
Yeah.

2170
01:48:03,810 --> 01:48:04,830
Would you step in and go,
hey man,

2171
01:48:04,860 --> 01:48:05,730
don't pussy grab.
Oh,

2172
01:48:05,731 --> 01:48:06,770
do okay.
Um,

2173
01:48:07,080 --> 01:48:10,080
so hear him talk though.
He's so crazy when you want to keep them

2174
01:48:10,081 --> 01:48:11,430
and keep running.
No,

2175
01:48:11,530 --> 01:48:14,250
I don't.
Those people need to shut the fuck up.

2176
01:48:14,310 --> 01:48:15,270
Well,
I'm a centrist.

2177
01:48:15,271 --> 01:48:17,790
I'm a registered independent voter.
I'm a centrist.

2178
01:48:17,791 --> 01:48:18,780
I'm an equality list.

2179
01:48:19,080 --> 01:48:24,080
It's like I was,
I was gunning for Mccain for awhile and 

2180
01:48:24,080 --> 01:48:26,020
then until Pailin came along and then he
had his weird little meltdown.

2181
01:48:26,050 --> 01:48:26,720
I'm like,
no.

2182
01:48:27,900 --> 01:48:28,890
Hey now.
Oh yeah,

2183
01:48:28,891 --> 01:48:29,700
don't try.
No.

2184
01:48:29,710 --> 01:48:30,430
Yeah,
no,

2185
01:48:30,440 --> 01:48:30,970
no,
no,

2186
01:48:31,010 --> 01:48:31,470
no,
no.

2187
01:48:31,550 --> 01:48:36,000
I can see Russia from my porch.
She didn't actually say that.

2188
01:48:36,001 --> 01:48:37,350
Right.
That was an snl thing,

2189
01:48:37,640 --> 01:48:39,990
right.
He kind of said she could see Russia.

2190
01:48:40,590 --> 01:48:41,510
Wow.
Yeah,

2191
01:48:41,720 --> 01:48:44,290
she's kind kinda talking about it.
I always,

2192
01:48:44,350 --> 01:48:46,710
I always thought that was like a Tina 
Fey,

2193
01:48:46,711 --> 01:48:49,800
like snl thing and then they like it ran
into it.

2194
01:48:49,830 --> 01:48:51,760
It became that whole,
that whole deal.

2195
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:53,530
She was wonderful.
She was.

2196
01:48:54,090 --> 01:48:59,090
She was wonderful because she was like 
the first example of this anti 

2197
01:48:59,090 --> 01:49:01,950
intellectual ism on display,
but other than Bush of course,

2198
01:49:02,220 --> 01:49:07,220
but running for president,
running to be the king of the world and 

2199
01:49:07,220 --> 01:49:07,650
like being one of us being one of us.

2200
01:49:07,740 --> 01:49:09,030
Right.
We're all together.

2201
01:49:09,031 --> 01:49:13,170
The working class folks.
The blue collar job lunchbox.

2202
01:49:13,230 --> 01:49:14,820
Yeah.
And all the cars play tree.

2203
01:49:14,821 --> 01:49:19,821
It's got right behind that and all those
gears of war,

2204
01:49:20,371 --> 01:49:24,780
medal of honor playing mother fuckers 
that have like air fifteens and like,

2205
01:49:24,781 --> 01:49:26,460
yeah,
we're going to go take over a,

2206
01:49:26,461 --> 01:49:27,390
a,
you know,

2207
01:49:27,470 --> 01:49:30,120
a wildlife reserve up in Oregon and all 
that.

2208
01:49:30,180 --> 01:49:32,220
These are the people that are behind 
trump right now.

2209
01:49:32,520 --> 01:49:33,010
Yeah.
That,

2210
01:49:33,180 --> 01:49:35,790
that Oregon stuff was very confusing.
I had A.

2211
01:49:35,820 --> 01:49:38,230
I had a really pay attention to what's 
going on with that.

2212
01:49:38,640 --> 01:49:42,780
That leads to pay to use federal land to
graze your cattle on.

2213
01:49:42,810 --> 01:49:44,050
They didn't want to pay.
Yeah,

2214
01:49:44,340 --> 01:49:47,770
it's our land.
It's the United States government.

2215
01:49:48,310 --> 01:49:53,310
The entire United States people own that
land and the Blm is the recognized 

2216
01:49:54,671 --> 01:49:59,671
authority in order to monitor that land 
and the Blm is one of the lowest paid 

2217
01:50:01,030 --> 01:50:06,030
divisions,
so they need those licenses and fines 

2218
01:50:06,030 --> 01:50:09,811
and all that in order to function and in
order to do things like build fencing 

2219
01:50:09,811 --> 01:50:14,760
and allow places like all the national 
parks and Blm land and all that in order

2220
01:50:15,011 --> 01:50:16,900
for us to enjoy that.
Yeah,

2221
01:50:16,901 --> 01:50:21,901
exactly.
It was a very confusing argument that 

2222
01:50:21,901 --> 01:50:23,110
the argument they should be able to 
graze for free was very strange.

2223
01:50:23,400 --> 01:50:24,430
It's like,
well,

2224
01:50:24,690 --> 01:50:27,340
why should you not be able to pay your 
way?

2225
01:50:27,370 --> 01:50:31,230
Because they're the weird 
constitutionalist sovereign citizen Shit

2226
01:50:31,450 --> 01:50:34,960
because you're looking at the federal 
lands.

2227
01:50:34,990 --> 01:50:37,060
They are without a doubt,
a national resource,

2228
01:50:37,061 --> 01:50:37,540
right?
Yes,

2229
01:50:37,660 --> 01:50:42,660
absolutely.
It's a resource and in those resources 

2230
01:50:42,660 --> 01:50:46,350
you're going to have food for animals 
and this is what these animals are 

2231
01:50:46,350 --> 01:50:46,350
grazing on.

2232
01:50:46,420 --> 01:50:51,420
Well,
that also gets in the way of all these 

2233
01:50:51,420 --> 01:50:51,420
other wild animals that we protect like 
buffalo,

2234
01:50:51,420 --> 01:50:54,670
like the American Bison,
they need those and here's what's really

2235
01:50:54,671 --> 01:50:59,671
crazy about it.
They're killing bison in in large 

2236
01:50:59,671 --> 01:51:03,661
numbers and they're calling them in 
yellowstone and one of the reasons why 

2237
01:51:03,661 --> 01:51:05,740
is because the they will escape,
they will leave the parks borders and go

2238
01:51:05,741 --> 01:51:10,741
into these areas where traditionally 
cattle have grazed and they're so big 

2239
01:51:10,741 --> 01:51:15,691
and so robust that they sorta devastate 
these areas and then it effects the 

2240
01:51:15,691 --> 01:51:18,960
cattle market.
A paleontology came across that too.

2241
01:51:19,070 --> 01:51:21,880
Did you?
We think that a couple,

2242
01:51:21,881 --> 01:51:26,881
a couple research researchers have 
considered that the expanse of the 

2243
01:51:28,750 --> 01:51:33,750
Antique Bison,
Bison and Tequilas and the longhorn 

2244
01:51:33,750 --> 01:51:34,660
bison pies and Lana fronds.
When they came across the bering sea and

2245
01:51:34,690 --> 01:51:37,540
got into North America with the 
recession of glaciers,

2246
01:51:37,810 --> 01:51:42,810
they out competed mammoths.
They out competed a lot of natural 

2247
01:51:42,810 --> 01:51:44,710
grazing herbivores because they eat 
faster,

2248
01:51:44,860 --> 01:51:46,960
they're larger,
they breed quicker.

2249
01:51:47,230 --> 01:51:50,230
They can basically terraform and area 
of.

2250
01:51:50,620 --> 01:51:53,710
They can eat saplings from trees and 
grass.

2251
01:51:55,600 --> 01:51:58,990
They can drink mud and get hydrated.
These are amazing,

2252
01:51:58,991 --> 01:52:03,991
well evolved creatures and well adapted 
to that environment that got into the 

2253
01:52:03,991 --> 01:52:07,891
perfect environment to just go and 
that's why we didn't have any native 

2254
01:52:07,961 --> 01:52:12,961
horses.
We didn't have any native elephants 

2255
01:52:12,961 --> 01:52:12,961
anymore and all that.
The Bison out competed.

2256
01:52:12,961 --> 01:52:14,110
So what you're saying?
Absolutely.

2257
01:52:14,320 --> 01:52:17,230
The bison rolls into cattle grazing 
land.

2258
01:52:17,860 --> 01:52:21,910
It's gonna fucking take over and thing 
is you can actually make Bison Buffalo,

2259
01:52:22,390 --> 01:52:24,850
buffalo in a.
In cows and buffaloes.

2260
01:52:25,120 --> 01:52:30,120
Yeah.
It's amazing to me that they didn't 

2261
01:52:30,120 --> 01:52:32,221
embrace the bison as more of a domestic 
animal in that sense because it's so 

2262
01:52:32,221 --> 01:52:34,630
much more robust than a cow.
I mean,

2263
01:52:35,110 --> 01:52:37,120
obviously cows are great and everything 
like that,

2264
01:52:37,121 --> 01:52:39,730
but you can't tell me that bison meat 
doesn't taste great.

2265
01:52:39,790 --> 01:52:40,990
No,
it's way leaner.

2266
01:52:40,991 --> 01:52:43,030
It's awesome.
That's fantastic.

2267
01:52:43,060 --> 01:52:44,890
It's higher in protein.
It's,

2268
01:52:44,960 --> 01:52:46,160
you know,
and especially

2269
01:52:46,160 --> 01:52:51,160
if they're grazing on grazing on grass,
not grain fed is higher in Omega threes 

2270
01:52:51,891 --> 01:52:53,660
and sixes.
It's better for you.

2271
01:52:53,661 --> 01:52:58,661
It's,
but we fucked that all up in the 18 

2272
01:52:58,661 --> 01:52:59,510
hundreds with like over hunting a bison 
and near extinction and market hunting.

2273
01:52:59,590 --> 01:53:04,590
That's what they did.
And sometimes they would leave giant 

2274
01:53:04,590 --> 01:53:07,151
piles of them just for their tongues.
They would just take their tongues and 

2275
01:53:07,151 --> 01:53:07,910
killed them for that and then hides and 
a bunch of different things.

2276
01:53:07,911 --> 01:53:12,911
And Yeah,
they did a number on them in the 18 

2277
01:53:12,911 --> 01:53:12,911
hundreds.
Yeah,

2278
01:53:12,911 --> 01:53:16,440
it's a shot in the dances with wolves.
That old costner flick where they come 

2279
01:53:16,440 --> 01:53:21,371
over the hill and obviously the white 
men was here because there's just 

2280
01:53:21,371 --> 01:53:23,240
skinned buffalo carcasses like as far as
the eye can see,

2281
01:53:23,241 --> 01:53:25,310
because they were just going for the 
Peltz Peltz.

2282
01:53:25,311 --> 01:53:27,560
We're selling that season.
It's dark man.

2283
01:53:27,561 --> 01:53:32,561
It's dark.
When you consider that what they did to 

2284
01:53:32,561 --> 01:53:33,050
all the different animals on the planet,
it's pretty fucking incredible.

2285
01:53:33,100 --> 01:53:38,100
What is the impact that human beings had
in such a short period of time of the 

2286
01:53:38,691 --> 01:53:42,140
impact we're having on the environment 
now in such a short period of time.

2287
01:53:42,141 --> 01:53:47,141
It's fucking crazy.
It's like we need to become more 

2288
01:53:47,141 --> 01:53:48,050
responsible with figuring out what the 
fuck we are doing.

2289
01:53:48,350 --> 01:53:51,710
Are you aware of the American Serengeti 
Project?

2290
01:53:52,310 --> 01:53:55,580
No.
They're trying to buy up giant chunks of

2291
01:53:55,640 --> 01:54:00,640
private land in the Montana,
Wyoming area and they're trying to build

2292
01:54:02,751 --> 01:54:07,751
a park even larger than yellowstone and 
what they're trying to do is sort of a 

2293
01:54:08,420 --> 01:54:13,420
habit.
This national park where you know 

2294
01:54:13,420 --> 01:54:16,220
there's a,
like a robust supply of Bison,

2295
01:54:16,520 --> 01:54:19,130
wolves,
coyotes,

2296
01:54:19,160 --> 01:54:24,160
all the,
all these different things and they're 

2297
01:54:24,160 --> 01:54:25,421
trying to.
They're spending a lot of money and 

2298
01:54:25,421 --> 01:54:25,421
they're also running block management on
it,

2299
01:54:25,421 --> 01:54:29,801
which means means they're going to open 
it up to hunters as well and they're 

2300
01:54:29,801 --> 01:54:32,090
trying to take these areas of private 
land,

2301
01:54:32,120 --> 01:54:37,120
buy him up and then slowly converted 
into a gigantic public park that they 

2302
01:54:39,231 --> 01:54:40,280
think,
you know,

2303
01:54:40,281 --> 01:54:42,650
as far as the animals that have 
survived,

2304
01:54:43,280 --> 01:54:46,880
that will in some way mimic the 
original,

2305
01:54:46,881 --> 01:54:48,500
what they call American Serengeti.

2306
01:54:48,620 --> 01:54:50,660
That would be fucking cool.
Pretty interesting.

2307
01:54:50,661 --> 01:54:53,270
There's a guy named American prairie 
preserve.

2308
01:54:53,360 --> 01:54:53,990
Oh,
neat.

2309
01:54:54,070 --> 01:54:55,250
Reserve.
The idea of it,

2310
01:54:55,460 --> 01:54:58,340
the only question I would have for them 
is,

2311
01:54:59,090 --> 01:55:04,090
are there other species that have now 
adapted for the area that they're doing 

2312
01:55:04,090 --> 01:55:06,990
that they will impact with this?
Saying that is what happens.

2313
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:11,020
The rattlesnakes are.
They're a smaller cats like bobcat's,

2314
01:55:11,060 --> 01:55:13,850
things like that.
If you were taking burrowing owls,

2315
01:55:14,240 --> 01:55:19,240
if you're taking a bunch of things that 
are no longer in the area or very sparse

2316
01:55:19,671 --> 01:55:24,671
in the area and then you are condensing 
them into a spot and then kind of making

2317
01:55:26,061 --> 01:55:28,760
a Serengeti theme park,
I don't mean to offend them,

2318
01:55:29,210 --> 01:55:30,920
but that's just kinda the gist I'm 
getting.

2319
01:55:31,760 --> 01:55:33,890
If you fill it full of things that 
aren't there now,

2320
01:55:33,891 --> 01:55:35,990
you're going to be displacing things 
that are there now.

2321
01:55:36,470 --> 01:55:41,470
That's true.
I think what they're trying to do is 

2322
01:55:41,470 --> 01:55:41,470
they're looking at what happened in 
Africa,

2323
01:55:41,470 --> 01:55:44,640
like in Africa instead of large scale 
agriculture.

2324
01:55:44,640 --> 01:55:47,880
The way we've embraced that in the 
United States for,

2325
01:55:48,060 --> 01:55:50,730
for most people,
they think about food.

2326
01:55:50,990 --> 01:55:52,440
You know,
they go to the store,

2327
01:55:52,470 --> 01:55:54,690
they go to the grocery store,
they go to the vegetable aisle,

2328
01:55:54,691 --> 01:55:57,840
they get their food.
But very few people actually go to visit

2329
01:55:57,841 --> 01:56:02,841
these enormous swaths of land that had 
been converted to large scale 

2330
01:56:02,841 --> 01:56:03,290
agriculture.
Right?

2331
01:56:03,480 --> 01:56:06,720
And we think of large scale agriculture,
large scale,

2332
01:56:07,040 --> 01:56:08,130
um,
you know,

2333
01:56:08,190 --> 01:56:12,450
like ag gag laws refer to factory 
farming and things along those lines.

2334
01:56:12,451 --> 01:56:14,520
We don't think of factory farming in 
terms of vegetables,

2335
01:56:14,521 --> 01:56:18,600
but even that itself has had a 
devastating effect on,

2336
01:56:18,610 --> 01:56:21,470
uh,
on different parts of this country where

2337
01:56:21,471 --> 01:56:26,471
the,
it's just the soil has been completely 

2338
01:56:26,471 --> 01:56:28,851
depleted of minerals and needs to be 
constantly replenished with minerals 

2339
01:56:28,851 --> 01:56:32,450
every day.
But when you look at what they did in 

2340
01:56:32,450 --> 01:56:33,570
Africa,
they sort of decided to take these parks

2341
01:56:33,571 --> 01:56:37,140
and convert them into these enormous 
wildlife preserves.

2342
01:56:37,200 --> 01:56:42,200
And so these animals exist more or less 
in a very similar state to the way 

2343
01:56:42,200 --> 01:56:45,210
they've done thousands of years ago.
Okavango Delta Reserve and all that.

2344
01:56:45,211 --> 01:56:45,780
Yeah,
that,

2345
01:56:45,870 --> 01:56:49,260
that's red.
But are they importing animals into it?

2346
01:56:49,620 --> 01:56:51,180
You'll see,
I don't know what they're going to do as

2347
01:56:51,181 --> 01:56:56,181
far as bringing in animals,
but what they've done in terms of what 

2348
01:56:56,181 --> 01:56:58,470
they've done and yellowstone,
when they brought in wolves,

2349
01:56:58,960 --> 01:57:03,960
I'll say,
although this region was once known for 

2350
01:57:03,960 --> 01:57:04,050
its abundance of wildlife,
current wildlife populations are greatly

2351
01:57:04,051 --> 01:57:09,051
diminished.
American prairie reserve works to build 

2352
01:57:09,051 --> 01:57:09,060
wildlife populations in three strategic 
ways,

2353
01:57:09,480 --> 01:57:14,480
collaborating with state and federal 
agencies who oversee all wildlife 

2354
01:57:14,480 --> 01:57:18,620
management decisions on their population
targets for at risk species such as the 

2355
01:57:18,620 --> 01:57:23,100
swift Fox partnering with ranching 
operations around the preserves edges to

2356
01:57:23,101 --> 01:57:25,710
increase tolerance for wildlife.
That's a weird word.

2357
01:57:26,010 --> 01:57:31,010
Tolerance for wildlife,
reducing the amount of kills and the 

2358
01:57:31,010 --> 01:57:32,160
regions habitat fragmentation

2359
01:57:32,430 --> 01:57:35,060
like tolerance for wildlife.
It's like.

2360
01:57:35,070 --> 01:57:37,800
I'm sorry if your ranching nearer of 
thing like that,

2361
01:57:37,801 --> 01:57:38,880
you should be tolerant

2362
01:57:38,920 --> 01:57:43,920
of wildlife.
Well the problem is if feel like it 

2363
01:57:43,920 --> 01:57:45,520
interferes on their,
on their private land,

2364
01:57:46,570 --> 01:57:47,860
that's where it gets weird,
right?

2365
01:57:47,861 --> 01:57:50,560
If there's not a fucking fence a lot,
they can keep a buffalo out.

2366
01:57:50,650 --> 01:57:52,120
Oh Hell No.
If it wants to go,

2367
01:57:52,121 --> 01:57:54,160
it's going through.
So this idea that you're going to put up

2368
01:57:54,161 --> 01:57:59,161
a fence and then somehow know that lush 
green grass is going to be saved from 

2369
01:57:59,161 --> 01:58:00,880
Buffalo.
Not really.

2370
01:58:00,970 --> 01:58:03,070
They're just gonna fucking headbutts.
That fence

2371
01:58:03,240 --> 01:58:08,240
says bison restoration.
They've reintroduced bice in 2005 after 

2372
01:58:08,240 --> 01:58:08,740
120 year absence.
Hm,

2373
01:58:09,120 --> 01:58:10,080
interesting.
Yeah.

2374
01:58:10,081 --> 01:58:13,380
So they are.
They're doing importing animals.

2375
01:58:13,410 --> 01:58:18,410
So how are the 120 year Absence Bison 
over the last 11 years impacting the 

2376
01:58:21,091 --> 01:58:22,290
cougar,
the Swift Fox,

2377
01:58:22,291 --> 01:58:24,720
the pronghorn black footed ferrets and 
grassland birds,

2378
01:58:24,960 --> 01:58:26,070
all of that.
That's like,

2379
01:58:26,730 --> 01:58:30,240
I want to know more before I would sign 
off on something like that.

2380
01:58:30,241 --> 01:58:32,790
It's like how much?
How many bison did you introduce?

2381
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,250
Um,
what is there a propagation?

2382
01:58:35,251 --> 01:58:37,760
What is their current gestation rate?
Um,

2383
01:58:37,890 --> 01:58:40,500
what is their current,
a birth to death ratio.

2384
01:58:40,770 --> 01:58:45,770
How are they impacting a place that they
haven't been for $120?

2385
01:58:46,150 --> 01:58:49,000
One hundred and 20 years for a lot of 
animal species is a very short amount of

2386
01:58:49,001 --> 01:58:52,210
time.
For others it's just the right amount of

2387
01:58:52,211 --> 01:58:56,230
time to start really adapting to an 
environment and establishing an entirely

2388
01:58:56,231 --> 01:58:57,910
new Predator to prey relationship with 
things.

2389
01:58:57,911 --> 01:59:02,911
They're,
all of a sudden you put in this 

2390
01:59:02,911 --> 01:59:03,880
monstrous fucking three ton beast

2391
01:59:05,540 --> 01:59:07,820
that could screw a lot of things up.
Yeah,

2392
01:59:07,830 --> 01:59:08,480
it could.
I mean,

2393
01:59:08,481 --> 01:59:11,870
they require a lot of food,
a lot of resources,

2394
01:59:12,080 --> 01:59:14,900
and we've seen what happens when they've
done things like this.

2395
01:59:14,960 --> 01:59:17,240
Well,
particularly with wolves in yellowstone,

2396
01:59:17,241 --> 01:59:22,241
it's been really fascinating to see what
the impact it's had on animals and how 

2397
01:59:22,241 --> 01:59:25,710
the animals have sort of shifted where 
they live and behave and it's uh,

2398
01:59:25,720 --> 01:59:27,260
it's,
it's so cool.

2399
01:59:27,440 --> 01:59:28,820
But it also,
it's also like,

2400
01:59:28,850 --> 01:59:30,350
man,
what a cautionary tale.

2401
01:59:30,351 --> 01:59:35,351
We're kind of like playing,
playing creator and a lot of ways by 

2402
01:59:35,351 --> 01:59:36,710
introducing these things.
We have a big debate going on that right

2403
01:59:36,711 --> 01:59:40,190
now in paleontology,
the whole cloning deal,

2404
01:59:41,030 --> 01:59:44,510
cloning wooly mammoths and all that.
Where do you stand on that?

2405
01:59:45,700 --> 01:59:48,440
Um,
I kind of stand on more of an empirical,

2406
01:59:48,730 --> 01:59:53,730
uh,
area that as of now we have not 

2407
01:59:53,730 --> 01:59:56,150
discovered viable enough material in 
order to clone something.

2408
01:59:56,600 --> 01:59:58,670
The technology is not there.
I've,

2409
01:59:58,810 --> 02:00:00,250
uh,
I've talked to a while.

2410
02:00:00,260 --> 02:00:05,260
I was in Siberia and a couple of years 
ago I talked to you some of the leading 

2411
02:00:05,260 --> 02:00:08,570
geneticists from South Korea,
like in Sung Lang and all those guys,

2412
02:00:09,110 --> 02:00:14,110
and they're saying like maybe 50 years 
because the way the cloning a has to 

2413
02:00:14,110 --> 02:00:16,160
happen,
we have to find viable DNA,

2414
02:00:16,490 --> 02:00:21,490
a complete,
like a complete individual genome plant 

2415
02:00:21,490 --> 02:00:23,750
that into for woolly mammoths 
specifically plant that into the nearest

2416
02:00:23,751 --> 02:00:25,580
living relative,
which is the Asian elephant.

2417
02:00:26,090 --> 02:00:29,630
That means we have to harvest an egg 
from a female Asian elephant,

2418
02:00:29,720 --> 02:00:34,720
which is difficult to do.
We would have to harvest many eggs 

2419
02:00:34,720 --> 02:00:38,470
because Dolly the sheep had like 870 
some odd tries before 12 stuck and one 

2420
02:00:40,940 --> 02:00:44,090
was born.
Trying to do that with elephants,

2421
02:00:44,091 --> 02:00:49,091
they go into must every like for three 
days out of a year or something like 

2422
02:00:49,091 --> 02:00:49,091
that.

2423
02:00:49,091 --> 02:00:52,010
I don't know the specifics,
but that's a huge monumental tasks to do

2424
02:00:52,011 --> 02:00:55,010
by itself.
I've seen woolly mammoth carcasses.

2425
02:00:55,011 --> 02:00:56,990
I've looked at them under biological 
microscopes.

2426
02:00:56,991 --> 02:01:00,820
I've taken tissue to have put into 
scanning electron microscopes.

2427
02:01:00,840 --> 02:01:04,250
We've looked for viable DNA,
have not found any fat fragments.

2428
02:01:04,790 --> 02:01:09,790
Sure,
but not in the entire thing in the 

2429
02:01:09,790 --> 02:01:10,010
genome.
This animal went extinct.

2430
02:01:10,460 --> 02:01:13,430
This animal went extinct possibly with 
human interaction.

2431
02:01:13,460 --> 02:01:18,460
We're not quite sure yet,
but definitely through an inability to 

2432
02:01:18,460 --> 02:01:21,080
adapt to a changing climate.
This is the perfect example.

2433
02:01:21,350 --> 02:01:23,900
If humans were not involved of natural 
selection,

2434
02:01:24,230 --> 02:01:27,740
this animal could not live in the 
environment anymore.

2435
02:01:29,360 --> 02:01:34,360
That being said,
should we establish the Pleistocene Park

2436
02:01:34,461 --> 02:01:37,820
in Siberia and clone woolly mammoths?
I don't think so.

2437
02:01:38,270 --> 02:01:40,400
I think this would be better used

2438
02:01:41,060 --> 02:01:44,840
and not being a genetics expert or 
geneticists at all.

2439
02:01:45,620 --> 02:01:49,250
I think it would be better used for 
actual human interactive deaths,

2440
02:01:49,550 --> 02:01:52,970
Dodos Moa,
Tasmanian Tigers,

2441
02:01:53,540 --> 02:01:58,540
passenger pigeons,
things we have specimens of now that 

2442
02:01:58,641 --> 02:02:00,760
would be easier to do.
Like they're working on patches,

2443
02:02:00,830 --> 02:02:04,740
passenger pigeons right now with the.
I think it's the three bard pigeon,

2444
02:02:04,770 --> 02:02:08,540
maybe just a bard pigeon genetics,
twitter and correct me on that.

2445
02:02:08,970 --> 02:02:13,970
Um,
but what is important about bringing 

2446
02:02:13,970 --> 02:02:16,331
back that pigeon?
I mean obviously there's a principal 

2447
02:02:16,331 --> 02:02:19,211
because their response,
we're responsible human beings are for 

2448
02:02:19,211 --> 02:02:19,211
their minds I think.
I think that's,

2449
02:02:19,211 --> 02:02:20,870
that's it.
It's maybe it's,

2450
02:02:20,871 --> 02:02:22,580
maybe it's the idea of,
wow,

2451
02:02:22,581 --> 02:02:23,820
we fucked up,
right,

2452
02:02:23,860 --> 02:02:27,740
but hasn't 90 percent of everything 
that's ever been alive dead.

2453
02:02:28,010 --> 02:02:29,510
Oh yeah.
Like 90,

2454
02:02:29,540 --> 02:02:33,230
95 percent of every single species that 
has ever been on the planet.

2455
02:02:33,231 --> 02:02:34,970
Four and a half billion years is 
extinct.

2456
02:02:35,020 --> 02:02:36,380
Right?
So where do we stop?

2457
02:02:36,410 --> 02:02:36,910
Like,
why,

2458
02:02:36,911 --> 02:02:41,911
why bringing back the Dodo bird and the 
Tasmanian Tiger and not the woolly 

2459
02:02:41,911 --> 02:02:44,990
mammoth because the dinosaurs,
the early,

2460
02:02:45,520 --> 02:02:47,240
you know,
early placental mammals,

2461
02:02:47,330 --> 02:02:52,330
Tiktaalik,
all of that going way back in time and 

2462
02:02:52,330 --> 02:02:56,051
things like the wooly mammoth through 
the saber tooth cat or the steppe 

2463
02:02:56,051 --> 02:02:58,190
mammoth or the,
uh,

2464
02:02:58,490 --> 02:03:00,440
you know,
the s stegall,

2465
02:03:00,441 --> 02:03:03,350
mastodon or mastodons,
those went extinct.

2466
02:03:03,351 --> 02:03:05,300
All,
whether it was like a cosmic impact,

2467
02:03:05,301 --> 02:03:07,310
huge volcanic eruptions,
climate change,

2468
02:03:07,670 --> 02:03:12,140
the oxygen suddenly dropping in the 
atmosphere or in the ocean.

2469
02:03:12,500 --> 02:03:14,870
All of that happened through natural 
resources.

2470
02:03:15,080 --> 02:03:20,080
We have now overstep those bounds and we
are responsible for the extinction of 

2471
02:03:21,141 --> 02:03:24,590
the golden frog,
the passenger on poor golden fog.

2472
02:03:24,591 --> 02:03:26,450
I miss it.
They're cute.

2473
02:03:26,750 --> 02:03:30,140
I don't even know they existed.
My life would not be impacted one way or

2474
02:03:30,141 --> 02:03:32,780
another.
What it probably not but,

2475
02:03:32,840 --> 02:03:34,100
but,
but we killed.

2476
02:03:35,900 --> 02:03:40,900
Do you think,
what do you think that the world around 

2477
02:03:40,900 --> 02:03:42,911
them,
the natural world has adapted to them 

2478
02:03:42,911 --> 02:03:43,820
being extinct and we should just leave 
well enough alone that that could be the

2479
02:03:43,821 --> 02:03:46,040
same argument as I was making against 
the Bison.

2480
02:03:46,130 --> 02:03:51,130
Absolutely right.
Think about all the money that would 

2481
02:03:51,130 --> 02:03:51,130
have to be spent to bring back the Dodo 
bird.

2482
02:03:51,290 --> 02:03:53,060
I personally say,
fuck the Dodo bird.

2483
02:03:54,030 --> 02:03:56,990
I don't miss him.
Plenty of cool birds.

2484
02:03:57,020 --> 02:04:02,020
They can go fuck themselves.
I mean we have things like the African 

2485
02:04:02,020 --> 02:04:02,750
African shoe bills and stuff like that.
Man.

2486
02:04:02,780 --> 02:04:05,150
Shoe bills are the shit.
They're like one of my all time favorite

2487
02:04:05,151 --> 02:04:10,151
animals.
Cassowaries when men cassowaries are 

2488
02:04:10,151 --> 02:04:12,200
fucking dinosaur to gas.
Warri cassowaries are the spell a ca?

2489
02:04:12,210 --> 02:04:14,600
Sso w a r y.
is that like a shoe bill?

2490
02:04:14,830 --> 02:04:15,320
Uh,
no.

2491
02:04:15,321 --> 02:04:17,770
It's scarier.
Ooze carrier than issue.

2492
02:04:17,810 --> 02:04:20,450
Basically.
This really cool looking semi flightless

2493
02:04:20,470 --> 02:04:23,870
bird that is an ostrich bro.

2494
02:04:24,420 --> 02:04:26,240
Close.
No,

2495
02:04:26,270 --> 02:04:28,640
we want the one.
We want the one with the head crest.

2496
02:04:29,660 --> 02:04:30,910
Yep.
Oh,

2497
02:04:31,520 --> 02:04:34,850
now Google Castle warrior attack.
See?

2498
02:04:34,860 --> 02:04:39,860
But that's not as cool as issue bill.
They're and they're pretty and 

2499
02:04:39,860 --> 02:04:41,100
everything like that,
but bills have the coolest bill.

2500
02:04:41,210 --> 02:04:43,590
Shoe bills have a goddamn hatching on 
their face.

2501
02:04:43,620 --> 02:04:48,620
These have those like rapper clause.
They what they do when they attack,

2502
02:04:48,870 --> 02:04:51,660
they kick up and try and [inaudible] oh,
Yep.

2503
02:04:51,690 --> 02:04:52,990
There we go.
Oh,

2504
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:55,260
this guy's coming at it with a board.
Yeah.

2505
02:04:55,590 --> 02:05:00,590
It's like you,
you will get owned by category and 

2506
02:05:00,590 --> 02:05:01,470
they're big man.
How big are they?

2507
02:05:01,700 --> 02:05:02,160
Uh,
you know,

2508
02:05:02,180 --> 02:05:04,980
they're,
they're decent sized pushing six feet.

2509
02:05:05,240 --> 02:05:06,300
Nine,
26.

2510
02:05:06,301 --> 02:05:08,970
What happened?
Sixteen year old Philip Mclean.

2511
02:05:08,971 --> 02:05:10,160
Did he get jacked?
Yep.

2512
02:05:10,650 --> 02:05:12,090
He got killed.
Oh,

2513
02:05:12,600 --> 02:05:13,500
third tallest,
second,

2514
02:05:13,501 --> 02:05:14,690
heaviest bird.
Whoa.

2515
02:05:14,940 --> 02:05:15,720
Look,
have a look at those.

2516
02:05:15,721 --> 02:05:17,820
Feeding clause was fucking things.
Yes.

2517
02:05:17,880 --> 02:05:21,360
Christ,
they've run 49 miles an hour.

2518
02:05:21,360 --> 02:05:23,130
They're four point nine feet tall.
Oh,

2519
02:05:23,131 --> 02:05:25,260
look at those clauses are horrific,
man.

2520
02:05:25,270 --> 02:05:27,460
Yeah,
well they're,

2521
02:05:27,500 --> 02:05:29,670
they're trippy dude there.
And look.

2522
02:05:29,700 --> 02:05:34,700
Hey,
that's like a t rex foot that is a 

2523
02:05:34,700 --> 02:05:34,700
theropod foot.
And get to get them in a heel hook.

2524
02:05:34,700 --> 02:05:39,170
That's the key.
The key is you got to get a hand on one 

2525
02:05:39,170 --> 02:05:39,990
of the,
the bottom of one of the feet,

2526
02:05:40,020 --> 02:05:42,270
like the ankle,
like right where it meets the foot.

2527
02:05:42,750 --> 02:05:47,750
You get a hand on one and then you stay 
on the outside and then you want a 

2528
02:05:47,750 --> 02:05:48,990
butterfly hook the other side and just 
snap that leg.

2529
02:05:49,350 --> 02:05:51,000
I don't think they would even know how 
to defend.

2530
02:05:51,600 --> 02:05:53,910
They probably shitty defensive.
Probably try to peck at you.

2531
02:05:54,380 --> 02:05:59,380
You know that's not going to help.
What a weird animal for the shoe builds 

2532
02:05:59,380 --> 02:05:59,380
cooler shit.
Sorry.

2533
02:05:59,380 --> 02:05:59,470
Okay.
They look,

2534
02:05:59,480 --> 02:06:03,090
they do look cooler for the head and 
they can like die this too.

2535
02:06:03,150 --> 02:06:05,440
They have those fucking evil rasterize 
and they again,

2536
02:06:05,490 --> 02:06:08,250
they can totally just like NAC.
You with that?

2537
02:06:08,370 --> 02:06:11,700
Would that delegate elegant?
Like look at that fucker.

2538
02:06:11,860 --> 02:06:14,670
My favorite videos online is a shoe 
bill,

2539
02:06:14,880 --> 02:06:19,880
which is this fucking dinosaur bird eats
this snakehead fish,

2540
02:06:20,580 --> 02:06:25,580
which is this fish that can figure out 
how to get out of the water and walk to 

2541
02:06:25,580 --> 02:06:29,471
the next pond.
So this prehistoric fucking creepy ass 

2542
02:06:29,471 --> 02:06:33,270
bird kills is prehistoric,
creepy ass fish that can walk on land.

2543
02:06:33,271 --> 02:06:36,220
Like literally it's a walking,
transitionary fossil.

2544
02:06:36,221 --> 02:06:38,790
Yeah,
it is fucking walking on land.

2545
02:06:39,940 --> 02:06:41,790
It's,
it's a crazy video man.

2546
02:06:42,030 --> 02:06:44,540
Is this.
It may be.

2547
02:06:45,420 --> 02:06:48,300
They're so creepy.
Look into they just so heartless.

2548
02:06:48,330 --> 02:06:50,270
We it back in the,
uh,

2549
02:06:51,030 --> 02:06:54,150
back during the age of mammals,
a post dinosaur.

2550
02:06:54,740 --> 02:06:56,550
Uh,
we had things called terror birds.

2551
02:06:56,580 --> 02:06:58,870
Yes.
We were talking about those yesterday at

2552
02:06:58,880 --> 02:07:00,330
like eight,
10 feet tall.

2553
02:07:00,390 --> 02:07:05,390
Giant flightless birds with a huge 
fucking battle axes for phases.

2554
02:07:05,421 --> 02:07:06,520
Yeah.
It's like,

2555
02:07:06,540 --> 02:07:09,060
so here we go.
It's a little smaller one.

2556
02:07:09,061 --> 02:07:14,061
That's a small tear bird.
And they were predatory monsters just 

2557
02:07:14,061 --> 02:07:15,660
running around Jack and things.
They're not flightless though,

2558
02:07:15,780 --> 02:07:17,100
are they?
I don't know if they are.

2559
02:07:17,160 --> 02:07:18,440
I don't like it,
right?

2560
02:07:18,450 --> 02:07:21,570
Don't believe so.
It is kind of amazing when you,

2561
02:07:21,930 --> 02:07:26,930
when you find out how many different 
animals existed in North America alone.

2562
02:07:27,750 --> 02:07:29,190
Just 10,000
years ago.

2563
02:07:29,250 --> 02:07:31,410
Camels started here.
Camels.

2564
02:07:31,890 --> 02:07:33,160
All dogs.
Yeah.

2565
02:07:33,450 --> 02:07:37,690
I'm reading a coyote by Dan Flores.
I wanted to read that.

2566
02:07:37,691 --> 02:07:40,000
It's fucking great.
It's crazy.

2567
02:07:40,030 --> 02:07:42,400
It's what a crazy animal.
A coyote on this by the.

2568
02:07:42,450 --> 02:07:43,720
Well,
it's nuts.

2569
02:07:43,960 --> 02:07:47,260
He's coming on the podcast.
I think he's going to be here in January

2570
02:07:47,261 --> 02:07:48,310
whenever he's in town.
Oh,

2571
02:07:48,311 --> 02:07:49,240
that's cool.
Yeah,

2572
02:07:49,241 --> 02:07:50,200
he's,
he's,

2573
02:07:50,201 --> 02:07:51,700
uh,
if you want to listen to him too.

2574
02:07:51,700 --> 02:07:56,320
He's on the mediator podcast with Steve 
Rinella maybe six,

2575
02:07:56,321 --> 02:08:01,321
eight months ago.
They did a podcast together and I've 

2576
02:08:01,321 --> 02:08:01,321
listened to it three or four times.
It's amazing.

2577
02:08:01,321 --> 02:08:05,760
Right on horses.
Horses started here and went extinct 

2578
02:08:05,760 --> 02:08:07,630
here and made it all across the world of
the rest of the world.

2579
02:08:07,660 --> 02:08:09,220
And then were brought here by Spanish 
settlers.

2580
02:08:09,221 --> 02:08:11,480
That's what they were brought back.
Yeah.

2581
02:08:11,540 --> 02:08:14,500
And then now they're everywhere.
There's wild horses.

2582
02:08:14,501 --> 02:08:16,030
Thousands of them.
Tens of thousands.

2583
02:08:16,031 --> 02:08:17,730
All throughout the southwest.
Yeah.

2584
02:08:17,760 --> 02:08:21,860
It's the really cool things like that.
And when the isthmus of Panama,

2585
02:08:21,861 --> 02:08:26,260
when Panama of rose up and connected the
two continents together,

2586
02:08:26,620 --> 02:08:31,620
you had the,
just this awesome transition of life 

2587
02:08:31,620 --> 02:08:34,801
like llamas and birds and a big cats and
that back and forth just to show why the

2588
02:08:37,181 --> 02:08:42,181
pronghorn antelope is so fast.
There's so much faster than anything 

2589
02:08:42,181 --> 02:08:46,681
that could catch it today because they 
lived and they evolved in a time where 

2590
02:08:46,681 --> 02:08:48,610
there was like Cheetah,
like cats morass and Onyx,

2591
02:08:48,611 --> 02:08:52,270
the American Cina the bad ass and beyond
that.

2592
02:08:52,271 --> 02:08:53,470
So everybody's like,
oh,

2593
02:08:53,471 --> 02:08:57,180
we had cheetahs and we had to cut lines 
that were bigger than African lion.

2594
02:08:57,220 --> 02:08:59,740
There a trucks,
half a ton of angry.

2595
02:09:01,750 --> 02:09:02,710
Eight,
9,000

2596
02:09:02,711 --> 02:09:06,080
pounds.
Is this Kerry diving?

2597
02:09:06,620 --> 02:09:07,750
Everybody's like,
oh,

2598
02:09:07,751 --> 02:09:08,320
well,
you know,

2599
02:09:08,350 --> 02:09:09,790
saber tooth cat.
It's not tiger.

2600
02:09:09,791 --> 02:09:10,420
It's kept.
By the way,

2601
02:09:10,900 --> 02:09:15,900
I'm a.
I just wrote from working at the tar 

2602
02:09:15,900 --> 02:09:16,540
pits for five years.
A seller with a,

2603
02:09:16,780 --> 02:09:17,830
uh,
we know,

2604
02:09:17,860 --> 02:09:22,860
we don't know,
but we can guess that they were because 

2605
02:09:22,860 --> 02:09:25,561
they had short tails.
They're ambush predators because of the 

2606
02:09:25,561 --> 02:09:29,101
environments.
We find them in a likely they had a 

2607
02:09:29,101 --> 02:09:31,981
longer coat.
It was counter shaded maybe with some 

2608
02:09:31,981 --> 02:09:33,460
sort of borrowing or reticulated pattern
in order to blend in.

2609
02:09:33,670 --> 02:09:36,460
Think like a really big scary bobcat.
A okay.

2610
02:09:36,670 --> 02:09:40,270
Somebody tried to tell me that a bobcat 
and a mountain lion with the same thing,

2611
02:09:40,630 --> 02:09:41,800
but yeah,
I was like,

2612
02:09:41,801 --> 02:09:42,610
what?
No,

2613
02:09:42,611 --> 02:09:46,140
I'm talking about are all the same.
Cool.

2614
02:09:46,190 --> 02:09:47,410
Mcconkell Laura.
Yeah,

2615
02:09:47,470 --> 02:09:48,460
Pumas,
mountain lions.

2616
02:09:48,490 --> 02:09:50,650
The same thing.
This guy was trying to say that a bobcat

2617
02:09:50,651 --> 02:09:55,651
was same thing because I was saying that
I saw a bobcat and it's cubs recently 

2618
02:09:55,990 --> 02:09:59,680
and I thought it was a mountain lion 
because I saw it for us second,

2619
02:09:59,681 --> 02:10:01,420
like a bar,
like not even a second,

2620
02:10:01,421 --> 02:10:02,230
like a half a second.

2621
02:10:02,230 --> 02:10:07,230
And my friend saw it before me.
I turned to see it and it was a mama 

2622
02:10:07,230 --> 02:10:08,850
with her cubs and my brain when they 
said a cat,

2623
02:10:08,880 --> 02:10:10,210
my brain was like,
oh,

2624
02:10:10,510 --> 02:10:15,510
they must be in a mountain lion.
So like in my mind the half of a second 

2625
02:10:15,510 --> 02:10:16,030
I saw it.
I had seen a mountain lion,

2626
02:10:16,870 --> 02:10:19,390
but it was actually a bobcat and this 
guy was like,

2627
02:10:19,391 --> 02:10:20,530
well they're the same thing.
I was like,

2628
02:10:20,560 --> 02:10:21,280
no,
the fuck.

2629
02:10:21,281 --> 02:10:25,510
They are like not even close.
It's not like a wolf and a coyote.

2630
02:10:25,800 --> 02:10:27,400
A wolf can fuck a coyote.
Yeah.

2631
02:10:27,500 --> 02:10:29,040
And they can make babies.
Yeah.

2632
02:10:29,190 --> 02:10:30,670
Kyle could fuck a dog.
We're all.

2633
02:10:30,671 --> 02:10:32,740
Everything is a wolf.
All those things.

2634
02:10:32,770 --> 02:10:36,020
All wild canids.
They're all interchangeable because they

2635
02:10:36,180 --> 02:10:40,100
are only a few of the canus genus that 
cannot do that,

2636
02:10:40,101 --> 02:10:40,880
I think.
Which ones?

2637
02:10:41,260 --> 02:10:42,280
Um,
uh,

2638
02:10:42,290 --> 02:10:43,180
one of,
uh,

2639
02:10:43,220 --> 02:10:44,800
the uh,
actually knows.

2640
02:10:45,020 --> 02:10:46,550
Yeah,
there's a jackal.

2641
02:10:46,610 --> 02:10:49,790
I think the black back,
maybe the black back.

2642
02:10:49,791 --> 02:10:50,900
Jackal.
Um,

2643
02:10:51,110 --> 02:10:56,110
God,
I used to know this because I would 

2644
02:10:56,110 --> 02:10:56,110
throw this creationists all the time 
because they're like,

2645
02:10:56,110 --> 02:10:56,240
oh,
you know,

2646
02:10:56,241 --> 02:10:57,260
it's the same kind.
It's like,

2647
02:10:57,261 --> 02:10:58,570
well these can't fuck these,
the,

2648
02:10:58,571 --> 02:11:00,200
there you go.
Um,

2649
02:11:00,590 --> 02:11:05,590
uh,
but like African spotted dogs are 

2650
02:11:05,590 --> 02:11:07,181
totally different genus,
a absolutely 100 percent totally 

2651
02:11:07,181 --> 02:11:07,550
different genus.
They're part of the Kennedy family,

2652
02:11:07,970 --> 02:11:09,560
but they cannot breed with anything 
else.

2653
02:11:09,561 --> 02:11:12,350
So can they breed and make a hybrid like
a lagger or no,

2654
02:11:12,410 --> 02:11:13,040
not even.
No,

2655
02:11:13,070 --> 02:11:14,750
not even close.
That's interesting.

2656
02:11:14,751 --> 02:11:15,590
Yeah.
It's like,

2657
02:11:15,591 --> 02:11:20,591
but you know,
the biological definition of species 

2658
02:11:20,591 --> 02:11:22,871
does kind of break down because it 
depends whether it's a environmental 

2659
02:11:22,871 --> 02:11:24,380
species or if it's a general articles.
Fokker yeah.

2660
02:11:25,340 --> 02:11:28,400
What a face on Halan Rad.
Look those big ears.

2661
02:11:28,430 --> 02:11:30,140
Perfect for just like tracking stuff.

2662
02:11:30,570 --> 02:11:35,570
Now was the only asshole tried to take 
an African wild dog like that in turn 

2663
02:11:35,570 --> 02:11:36,870
into a pet.
No idea muscle.

2664
02:11:36,920 --> 02:11:39,850
You right.
Maybe African hunting dogs,

2665
02:11:39,900 --> 02:11:42,350
you know,
I dunno.

2666
02:11:42,560 --> 02:11:45,920
I'm wild looking dog man.
I looked so wild there.

2667
02:11:45,930 --> 02:11:49,070
So the coloration of the.
It's like so dynamic.

2668
02:11:49,071 --> 02:11:50,300
Yeah.
But if you,

2669
02:11:50,330 --> 02:11:55,330
if you look at that pattern,
you've got lights and darks and look at 

2670
02:11:55,330 --> 02:11:57,560
the material behind it,
look at the grasses and they blend in.

2671
02:11:57,600 --> 02:11:58,180
Yeah.
They're,

2672
02:11:58,440 --> 02:12:00,650
they're literally like walking asap.
Cammo,

2673
02:12:00,710 --> 02:12:01,680
right?
Yeah.

2674
02:12:01,970 --> 02:12:03,650
Like Jamie,
Jamie to go back up to that one with the

2675
02:12:03,651 --> 02:12:05,720
teeth opened.
The picture you just showed.

2676
02:12:05,780 --> 02:12:07,690
Look at that.
Like that pattern.

2677
02:12:07,950 --> 02:12:10,310
I mean that is a perfect Predator 
pattern.

2678
02:12:10,311 --> 02:12:15,311
They sort of blend into the background,
especially from a distance if they're 

2679
02:12:15,311 --> 02:12:19,061
not moving because most animals they 
pick up outlines and then they pick up 

2680
02:12:19,701 --> 02:12:20,330
movement.

2681
02:12:20,490 --> 02:12:23,420
Yeah.
Then if the outline stops moving,

2682
02:12:23,421 --> 02:12:24,610
it disappears.
Yeah.

2683
02:12:24,650 --> 02:12:26,870
Especially with a cryptic coloration 
like that.

2684
02:12:26,900 --> 02:12:28,490
Yeah.
It was incredible.

2685
02:12:28,491 --> 02:12:32,450
That natural selection has led them to 
have those kinds of coats.

2686
02:12:33,170 --> 02:12:38,170
Well,
there's a here here in southern 

2687
02:12:38,170 --> 02:12:38,170
California.
We have two different kinds of snakes,

2688
02:12:38,170 --> 02:12:39,740
um,
or actually it's the same species,

2689
02:12:39,741 --> 02:12:41,360
but they have totally different color 
patterns.

2690
02:12:41,690 --> 02:12:44,870
The California king snake,
the white and black ones that you see,

2691
02:12:45,380 --> 02:12:48,860
they're either abandoned or striped.
The abandoned ones,

2692
02:12:49,280 --> 02:12:51,350
the ones with the horizontal across 
their bodies,

2693
02:12:51,740 --> 02:12:56,360
they tend to stay curled up underneath 
bushes in the desert.

2694
02:12:56,870 --> 02:12:59,600
So as they're white and black.
Yeah,

2695
02:12:59,660 --> 02:13:02,150
there we go.
So the abandoned ones like that,

2696
02:13:02,330 --> 02:13:03,650
they stay,
they stay,

2697
02:13:03,890 --> 02:13:06,180
they stay curled under,
uh,

2698
02:13:06,190 --> 02:13:10,040
under trees because as the sunlight is 
coming through,

2699
02:13:10,160 --> 02:13:12,650
it's creating bands across the road.
So they blend in.

2700
02:13:12,960 --> 02:13:16,670
The striped ones move more so the 
shadows are longer.

2701
02:13:17,670 --> 02:13:18,470
Wow.
Yeah.

2702
02:13:18,590 --> 02:13:20,340
It's really tricky.
Fuck No.

2703
02:13:20,450 --> 02:13:22,790
How the fuck does that happen without 
Jesus?

2704
02:13:23,630 --> 02:13:25,820
You explain me.
This is proof positive.

2705
02:13:25,821 --> 02:13:28,550
Just like the banana,
the atheist nightmare.

2706
02:13:28,610 --> 02:13:29,550
That banana.
Oh,

2707
02:13:29,630 --> 02:13:30,290
rate,
comforts,

2708
02:13:30,291 --> 02:13:32,790
banana.
Oh yeah.

2709
02:13:33,580 --> 02:13:38,340
This is proof positive as well that the 
Lord works in mysterious ways.

2710
02:13:38,370 --> 02:13:40,170
Ray.
I'm sorry you ever did that.

2711
02:13:40,290 --> 02:13:45,290
I'm happy he did it and I'm happy that 
the other dude was right next to them 

2712
02:13:45,290 --> 02:13:46,560
smiling like it made sense.
Kirk Cameron.

2713
02:13:46,820 --> 02:13:51,820
Kirk Cameron just fighting off the urge 
to soccer cock with every ounce of his 

2714
02:13:51,820 --> 02:13:55,401
body just fighting off the gay,
like it's a horde of angry zombies 

2715
02:13:55,401 --> 02:13:57,510
coming over a hill.
That picture of Ken Ham,

2716
02:13:57,930 --> 02:14:00,600
Cameron and fucking comfort.
It's like,

2717
02:14:00,601 --> 02:14:03,810
that's like three heads of Sarah bis the
dog from hell.

2718
02:14:03,811 --> 02:14:06,940
Like three heads of the hydro right 
there and just don't see hell.

2719
02:14:06,941 --> 02:14:08,610
And now I just see foolish people.

2720
02:14:08,640 --> 02:14:09,090
Well,
yeah,

2721
02:14:09,120 --> 02:14:11,610
I just see it,
but I'm the czar foolish people.

2722
02:14:11,640 --> 02:14:16,640
I see hell for science.
I see a problem for science in science 

2723
02:14:16,681 --> 02:14:21,681
education and everything going forward 
because these are the people that are 

2724
02:14:21,681 --> 02:14:25,820
building fucking full size arcs in the 
middle of God governs tendency when that

2725
02:14:25,830 --> 02:14:28,610
crack another one then beer.
So I'm happy doing that.

2726
02:14:28,700 --> 02:14:29,080
Yeah,
that was,

2727
02:14:29,090 --> 02:14:29,780
that was great.
What,

2728
02:14:29,781 --> 02:14:33,420
when was this called?
This was a from the Sierra Nevada.

2729
02:14:33,810 --> 02:14:36,000
It's a Goza.
It's a beer.

2730
02:14:36,050 --> 02:14:37,410
Yes.
Come with beverages.

2731
02:14:37,700 --> 02:14:42,700
No,
I'm totally into beer now because I'm 

2732
02:14:42,700 --> 02:14:44,680
solely into what,
what got you into the beer for the uh,

2733
02:14:44,730 --> 02:14:47,360
I've always been into beer.
I've always wanted to be doing like home

2734
02:14:47,370 --> 02:14:52,370
brewing stuff.
But because the Paleo market kind of 

2735
02:14:52,370 --> 02:14:53,280
dropped out,
my friend owns a bar and he's like,

2736
02:14:53,281 --> 02:14:54,390
Hey,
my bartenders leaving,

2737
02:14:54,391 --> 02:14:55,980
I've been drinking here for like five 
years.

2738
02:14:56,280 --> 02:14:58,920
I was part time security because they 
still had a guard card and all that.

2739
02:14:59,250 --> 02:15:00,840
Um,
he said,

2740
02:15:00,841 --> 02:15:02,790
hey,
my weekend bartenders going,

2741
02:15:02,791 --> 02:15:04,020
you know,
a lot about beer,

2742
02:15:04,021 --> 02:15:05,190
you know,
the whole menu here.

2743
02:15:05,490 --> 02:15:10,490
Do you want the weekend shifts?
Since you're not working Paleo people 

2744
02:15:10,490 --> 02:15:12,981
want to come visit you and stalk you and
give you a hard time about the flat 

2745
02:15:12,981 --> 02:15:15,651
earth with bars.
And so it's the faculty in East 

2746
02:15:15,651 --> 02:15:15,651
Hollywood.
It's seven zero,

2747
02:15:15,651 --> 02:15:16,980
seven North Heliotropism,
heliotropism,

2748
02:15:16,981 --> 02:15:18,570
melrose.
You shill.

2749
02:15:18,571 --> 02:15:22,830
They're coming at Chanel.
Ring it with flat earth knowledge.

2750
02:15:22,850 --> 02:15:23,900
Bring it.
Yeah.

2751
02:15:23,980 --> 02:15:28,980
It's like you want to roll in.
I'm having my birthday party there next 

2752
02:15:28,980 --> 02:15:28,980
Friday.
The 28th,

2753
02:15:28,980 --> 02:15:28,980
8:00
PM.

2754
02:15:28,980 --> 02:15:33,050
No such thing as gravity.
It is a magnetic electromagnetism.

2755
02:15:33,961 --> 02:15:34,650
Yeah.
Yeah.

2756
02:15:34,740 --> 02:15:35,820
Okay.
Yeah,

2757
02:15:36,320 --> 02:15:37,020
yeah,
sure.

2758
02:15:37,080 --> 02:15:39,900
Um,
our stickers magnetic.

2759
02:15:40,830 --> 02:15:42,450
Oh,
good point.

2760
02:15:43,530 --> 02:15:45,900
There you go.
Is Glass magnetic is plastic?

2761
02:15:45,990 --> 02:15:47,450
I mean,
come on man.

2762
02:15:47,530 --> 02:15:48,420
That's bullshit.

2763
02:15:48,510 --> 02:15:49,680
Well,
it's kind of funny.

2764
02:15:49,980 --> 02:15:51,240
Oh,
let's go like Ray Comfort,

2765
02:15:52,020 --> 02:15:54,840
like Ray Comfort.
And Kirk Cameron and poor bastard,

2766
02:15:55,020 --> 02:15:56,760
if he could just find a man who loved 
him.

2767
02:15:57,100 --> 02:15:57,880
Yeah.
Yeah.

2768
02:15:58,330 --> 02:16:03,330
Just come.
Just come free like you see it coming 

2769
02:16:03,330 --> 02:16:04,500
out of him.
Did that bullshit creationists Christmas

2770
02:16:04,501 --> 02:16:06,500
movie that he had last year?
Um,

2771
02:16:06,590 --> 02:16:11,590
uh,
you mean awesome movie like San God's 

2772
02:16:11,590 --> 02:16:11,590
not dead.
Is that the one?

2773
02:16:11,590 --> 02:16:11,590
No,
no,

2774
02:16:11,590 --> 02:16:12,360
no.
I'm thinking about saving Christmas.

2775
02:16:12,420 --> 02:16:13,290
Oh,
saving Christmas.

2776
02:16:13,291 --> 02:16:18,291
It's like the war on Christmas and Kirk 
Cameron's going to save it this 

2777
02:16:18,291 --> 02:16:18,710
December.
Oh yeah.

2778
02:16:18,720 --> 02:16:23,720
I think it actually took over.
Battlefield Earth is one of the worst 

2779
02:16:23,720 --> 02:16:24,490
movies on CMDB or rotten tomatoes.
Well,

2780
02:16:24,870 --> 02:16:26,820
I would see how it'd be in that 
category,

2781
02:16:26,821 --> 02:16:31,821
but did you ever see the one that he did
about those Christian novels about the 

2782
02:16:32,650 --> 02:16:34,110
left behind series?
Yes.

2783
02:16:34,120 --> 02:16:35,530
Yeah.
Wonderful.

2784
02:16:35,531 --> 02:16:37,570
I bought,
I bought it on vhs.

2785
02:16:37,840 --> 02:16:39,850
It's one of the last vhs tapes that I 
bought.

2786
02:16:39,910 --> 02:16:40,960
That's Rad.
Yeah,

2787
02:16:40,961 --> 02:16:42,250
I own it.
I own,

2788
02:16:42,400 --> 02:16:46,060
there's two of them.
I never even got through the first one.

2789
02:16:46,061 --> 02:16:49,630
I'm like 45 minutes in the first one.
My eyes are sweating,

2790
02:16:50,780 --> 02:16:53,230
shaking or I remember when those came 
out,

2791
02:16:53,260 --> 02:16:58,260
like in bookstores that like the actual 
book series I was walking by and like 

2792
02:16:58,260 --> 02:17:00,310
probably buying like a Neil Gaiman book 
or something like that,

2793
02:17:00,311 --> 02:17:03,940
like comics or some like cool,
like Scifi fantasy stuff.

2794
02:17:03,941 --> 02:17:04,600
When I saw that,
I'm like,

2795
02:17:04,990 --> 02:17:07,450
what?
The rapture is come.

2796
02:17:07,630 --> 02:17:09,430
There's only a few people left on the 
planet,

2797
02:17:09,431 --> 02:17:10,330
man.
Fuck that.

2798
02:17:10,360 --> 02:17:12,190
Just put it right back on the shelf and 
kept walking through.

2799
02:17:12,230 --> 02:17:14,550
The rapture comes in.
There's only a few people left.

2800
02:17:14,551 --> 02:17:18,610
So that means that God comes and takes 
away all the Christians that would leave

2801
02:17:18,611 --> 02:17:23,611
a lot of fucking people like this idea 
that it would only be a few people left.

2802
02:17:23,950 --> 02:17:25,510
It's kind of.
Yeah,

2803
02:17:25,511 --> 02:17:26,470
but the thing is,
it's like,

2804
02:17:26,530 --> 02:17:29,650
why is he going to take the Christians 
if you know Jews?

2805
02:17:29,680 --> 02:17:31,350
I'm genetically Jewish.
I have the,

2806
02:17:31,420 --> 02:17:35,120
the Ashkenazi k one and haplotype uh,
Mike [inaudible].

2807
02:17:35,140 --> 02:17:36,320
My mom,
um,

2808
02:17:36,370 --> 02:17:38,050
aren't we supposed to be the chosen 
people?

2809
02:17:38,470 --> 02:17:41,900
Allegedly allegedly 100 million,
140 slash thousand dollars,

2810
02:17:41,910 --> 02:17:43,010
something like that.
You have a.

2811
02:17:43,011 --> 02:17:46,020
Once America came along,
God changed teams right?

2812
02:17:46,021 --> 02:17:48,370
He got super down with the even ray 
comfort.

2813
02:17:48,371 --> 02:17:50,410
He decided as an Australian,
he got to get in,

2814
02:17:50,650 --> 02:17:53,140
get in tight with American Christians.
Can wait.

2815
02:17:53,141 --> 02:17:55,090
Is Re Australian or this?
CanNot.

2816
02:17:55,300 --> 02:17:59,230
Both of them are Ken and re like if you 
have a had him talk,

2817
02:17:59,290 --> 02:18:01,120
but here it's like really?
Oh No,

2818
02:18:01,121 --> 02:18:02,080
I'm sorry.
I'm thinking of.

2819
02:18:04,060 --> 02:18:07,300
I'm going to give you other jackass.
I'm thinking of the other jackass.

2820
02:18:07,810 --> 02:18:12,810
Kent Hovind,
the one that went into jail for tax 

2821
02:18:12,810 --> 02:18:12,810
evasion.

2822
02:18:12,810 --> 02:18:12,810
Yeah.
He's Dr.

2823
02:18:12,810 --> 02:18:13,860
Dr.
No,

2824
02:18:14,410 --> 02:18:15,370
not happening.
Dude.

2825
02:18:15,640 --> 02:18:18,010
Does he have anything to do with that?
Creationist museum will.

2826
02:18:18,110 --> 02:18:19,320
Who has something to do with the 
creative?

2827
02:18:19,330 --> 02:18:21,070
That's Ken Ham.
That's Ken Ham.

2828
02:18:21,200 --> 02:18:24,280
That's captain ham sandwiches.
Wonderful man.

2829
02:18:24,340 --> 02:18:26,410
Yeah.
With some wonderful ideas.

2830
02:18:27,130 --> 02:18:31,480
That creations museum and the Ark.
A love the arc and I hate to say it.

2831
02:18:31,600 --> 02:18:32,350
Okay.
Hey,

2832
02:18:32,440 --> 02:18:34,570
atheist twitter followers.
Don't roll me for this.

2833
02:18:35,560 --> 02:18:40,560
Ken Ham is fucking smart because of the 
way he does his advertising because of 

2834
02:18:41,951 --> 02:18:45,310
the way he does his look at that bigger 
than imagination.

2835
02:18:45,311 --> 02:18:46,450
That's like,
okay,

2836
02:18:46,930 --> 02:18:48,340
sure.
He may be completely,

2837
02:18:48,400 --> 02:18:50,890
you know,
chewing his own skin off at this point.

2838
02:18:50,891 --> 02:18:55,030
Losing money,
but think of what he did.

2839
02:18:55,690 --> 02:19:00,690
He did a huge debate with Bill Nye and 
got this going because all of the money 

2840
02:19:02,861 --> 02:19:05,820
that people spend on dvds and all that 
went to this too.

2841
02:19:05,821 --> 02:19:08,770
If you can get an annual pass for only 
175 bucks,

2842
02:19:08,771 --> 02:19:10,030
that's way cheaper than Disneyland.

2843
02:19:10,060 --> 02:19:15,060
You can go see it all year round.
You just keep going back and see that 

2844
02:19:15,060 --> 02:19:16,250
same stupid wooden boat all the time.
Wow.

2845
02:19:16,350 --> 02:19:19,320
Goes.
I liked the zip points.

2846
02:19:19,760 --> 02:19:22,510
I'll kind of zip.
I'm on a zip line,

2847
02:19:22,560 --> 02:19:26,080
zip and right off the top of the Noah's 
Ark,

2848
02:19:26,290 --> 02:19:31,290
right into the manger where the baby 
Jesus was born way up at the bottom of 

2849
02:19:31,290 --> 02:19:33,600
his plan.
He can didn't know what have ziplines.

2850
02:19:34,160 --> 02:19:39,160
Is that,
is that how he got all the animals off 

2851
02:19:39,160 --> 02:19:39,160
the Ark?
Yes.

2852
02:19:39,160 --> 02:19:39,160
Well,
that's also had no raised funds.

2853
02:19:39,160 --> 02:19:40,000
Oh,
right,

2854
02:19:40,010 --> 02:19:40,910
right.
All that would.

2855
02:19:41,180 --> 02:19:43,330
So where were the dinosaurs on the Ark?
They were,

2856
02:19:43,340 --> 02:19:45,980
but fucking dinosaurs are gay.
A lot of people don't know that.

2857
02:19:45,981 --> 02:19:47,050
That's why they all died off.

2858
02:19:49,120 --> 02:19:51,290
There was none.
No one was there to breathe.

2859
02:19:51,291 --> 02:19:54,530
They were all just doing each other.
There was a far side by Gary Larson,

2860
02:19:54,531 --> 02:19:56,870
one of those little comics a long,
long time ago.

2861
02:19:56,871 --> 02:19:58,370
It was like the real demise of the 
dinosaurs.

2862
02:19:58,371 --> 02:20:02,690
They're all smoking.
There was another one that's A.

2863
02:20:02,690 --> 02:20:07,690
Noah has a like a 105 howitzer mounted 
on the nose of the arch and firing it at

2864
02:20:07,761 --> 02:20:10,520
the dinosaur arc.
It's like what really happened?

2865
02:20:11,300 --> 02:20:16,300
Stuff like that.
It's like people make fun of this shit 

2866
02:20:16,300 --> 02:20:18,761
all the time.
Teach the controversy is a t shirt deal 

2867
02:20:18,761 --> 02:20:19,730
and it shows.
I have the shirt.

2868
02:20:19,731 --> 02:20:24,731
It's Rad.
You've got a triceratops with an ox 

2869
02:20:24,731 --> 02:20:25,880
harness on it and a guy with a plow 
behind it.

2870
02:20:26,300 --> 02:20:28,430
Then you also have the devil bearing a 
dinosaur.

2871
02:20:28,431 --> 02:20:31,220
Bones is teach the controversy.
They have a flat earth one,

2872
02:20:31,460 --> 02:20:33,200
a chem trail,
one and Illuminati one.

2873
02:20:33,200 --> 02:20:38,200
Their fucking Rad.
I wonder how much longer that kind of 

2874
02:20:38,200 --> 02:20:41,801
thinking that kind of a ray comfort 
thinking is going to be around just we 

2875
02:20:41,801 --> 02:20:41,801
have youtube.
Man.

2876
02:20:42,260 --> 02:20:45,110
You think so?
I think it's just going to get louder.

2877
02:20:45,140 --> 02:20:47,300
It's just going to get louder.
I think that.

2878
02:20:47,301 --> 02:20:50,610
I think not,
I think this is all this,

2879
02:20:50,620 --> 02:20:55,620
this ability to self publish and this 
kind of stuff is all cute and 

2880
02:20:55,620 --> 02:20:55,620
everything,
but I think it's a,

2881
02:20:55,620 --> 02:20:59,560
it's a step on this inevitable path.
I think we're on a path of complete 

2882
02:21:00,501 --> 02:21:01,880
enlightenment.
I really do,

2883
02:21:02,220 --> 02:21:07,220
and I think it's fucking Rad.
I think it's going to bypass all of our 

2884
02:21:07,220 --> 02:21:11,111
biological limitations.
I think technological innovations going 

2885
02:21:11,111 --> 02:21:12,920
to bypass the biological limitations 
that we're going to live in,

2886
02:21:12,921 --> 02:21:16,730
some sort of an augmented reality,
augmented by technology.

2887
02:21:17,230 --> 02:21:19,330
I think we're going to accept that and I
think we're going to.

2888
02:21:19,370 --> 02:21:21,890
We're going to dive into that and then 
once that happens,

2889
02:21:22,130 --> 02:21:27,130
I think slowly but surely just like the 
difference between what we know today 

2890
02:21:27,130 --> 02:21:31,790
versus what we knew or people new 2000 
years ago is pretty goddamn radical.

2891
02:21:31,970 --> 02:21:34,340
But when you think about 2000 years in 
terms of the earth,

2892
02:21:34,370 --> 02:21:35,460
it's nothing,
right?

2893
02:21:35,461 --> 02:21:35,950
Yeah.
It's no,

2894
02:21:35,960 --> 02:21:37,340
it's,
it's a blink of an eye.

2895
02:21:37,460 --> 02:21:38,530
Yeah.
It's,

2896
02:21:38,580 --> 02:21:41,270
it's the nanosecond reaction of a neuron
firing.

2897
02:21:41,271 --> 02:21:43,170
I mean,
even just 300 years ago,

2898
02:21:43,620 --> 02:21:48,620
just think of the timeframe between,
uh,

2899
02:21:49,481 --> 02:21:54,481
the Wright brothers first powered flight
and landing on the moon and then from 

2900
02:21:54,481 --> 02:21:57,350
landing on the moon to the space shuttle
to the ISS.

2901
02:21:57,470 --> 02:22:02,470
Now we have vertical landing rockets,
nuke powered rovers with lasers doing 

2902
02:22:02,470 --> 02:22:06,551
science on a different planet.
And we have two probes rapidly exiting 

2903
02:22:08,301 --> 02:22:09,950
the solar system.
The voyager probes,

2904
02:22:09,980 --> 02:22:14,980
they're fucking gone.
Go from the invention of radio to the 

2905
02:22:14,980 --> 02:22:14,980
Internet today.

2906
02:22:15,110 --> 02:22:16,460
I mean,
it's a blink of an eye.

2907
02:22:16,500 --> 02:22:17,210
Yeah.
Tiny,

2908
02:22:17,211 --> 02:22:19,710
tiny,
tiny amount of time and massive progress

2909
02:22:19,711 --> 02:22:24,711
has been made.
And you still have these assholes that 

2910
02:22:24,711 --> 02:22:26,771
right.
Make these videos about dinosaurs not 

2911
02:22:26,771 --> 02:22:26,771
being real or write blogs about the 
earth being flat,

2912
02:22:26,771 --> 02:22:31,581
but at the end of the day,
I just feel like that is more dismissed 

2913
02:22:31,581 --> 02:22:34,080
than ever before.
Less less likely to be adopted.

2914
02:22:34,140 --> 02:22:39,140
And I think it's dying.
I think it's the seemed like the last 

2915
02:22:39,140 --> 02:22:43,491
blips of ignorance where people are 
fighting against this is this the death 

2916
02:22:43,491 --> 02:22:46,100
knell is this people like Bob,
like going against Neil degrasse Tyson.

2917
02:22:46,730 --> 02:22:47,970
He's a silly man.
You know what I mean?

2918
02:22:47,971 --> 02:22:49,020
He's just a rapper,
right?

2919
02:22:49,290 --> 02:22:51,540
He doesn't really have to have any,
any real data,

2920
02:22:51,720 --> 02:22:54,420
but I think that that's what we're 
seeing with all this stuff.

2921
02:22:54,450 --> 02:22:59,450
I think we're seeing sort of the last 
gasps of of ignorance,

2922
02:22:59,730 --> 02:23:04,730
but he has a bunch of people that 
immediately do that and then a bunch of 

2923
02:23:04,730 --> 02:23:04,730
people go,
Whoa,

2924
02:23:05,660 --> 02:23:05,880
look.

2925
02:23:05,920 --> 02:23:09,450
In contemporary times it seems like it's
seems like it's a big deal,

2926
02:23:09,480 --> 02:23:14,480
but now thinking overall to be a 
conspiracist it's cool to be a 

2927
02:23:14,480 --> 02:23:18,420
conspiracy sheep.
It's like hip and Rad to think the earth

2928
02:23:18,421 --> 02:23:23,190
is flat and all that shit not really 
have be a real fucking moron.

2929
02:23:23,191 --> 02:23:28,170
To think the earth is flat 2016 to when 
you really do against them every fucking

2930
02:23:28,171 --> 02:23:28,840
morons.
No,

2931
02:23:28,920 --> 02:23:31,170
there are absolutely fucking 100 
percent.

2932
02:23:31,200 --> 02:23:33,130
I don't think it's going to last.
I hope not.

2933
02:23:33,630 --> 02:23:38,630
I hope not because it's drowning witches
once it's fucking exhausting for you 

2934
02:23:40,110 --> 02:23:43,290
because you keep biting into it.
The thing is,

2935
02:23:43,470 --> 02:23:45,930
again,
I want to mock them so the people,

2936
02:23:45,990 --> 02:23:48,570
the people listening and the people 
watching and all that go,

2937
02:23:48,810 --> 02:23:50,250
wow,
that guy's a jackass.

2938
02:23:50,570 --> 02:23:52,500
It's like,
it's like the earth is not flat.

2939
02:23:52,910 --> 02:23:57,600
I got suckered into it,
but also I have to admit it.

2940
02:23:57,630 --> 02:23:59,790
I kinda like out trolling the trolls 
man.

2941
02:23:59,880 --> 02:24:00,590
Yeah.
When,

2942
02:24:01,170 --> 02:24:06,170
when they come in and you just like set 
the perfect thing and they come back 

2943
02:24:07,621 --> 02:24:12,621
with something stupid and just fucking 
grabbed by the back of the net and go 

2944
02:24:12,621 --> 02:24:16,070
and they're done.
It's just like you like setting them up 

2945
02:24:16,070 --> 02:24:16,070
with facts.
Yeah.

2946
02:24:16,070 --> 02:24:18,190
I like setting them up and watching them
just trip over.

2947
02:24:18,210 --> 02:24:21,960
You enjoy that so much because they are 
dumb enough to do it to other people.

2948
02:24:21,961 --> 02:24:24,150
They deserve to have it done to them.
Right.

2949
02:24:24,710 --> 02:24:26,970
I'm doing addictive narcissistic 
assholes too.

2950
02:24:26,971 --> 02:24:28,380
Even when they're doing it to other 
people,

2951
02:24:28,381 --> 02:24:31,050
they're doing it to themselves.
I like to give them.

2952
02:24:31,110 --> 02:24:36,110
I like to troll them with facts and give
them just enough rope to hang themselves

2953
02:24:36,751 --> 02:24:39,110
and completely embarrassed themselves 
and they,

2954
02:24:39,150 --> 02:24:41,970
they do it all the time and then they 
get all flustered and they blocked me.

2955
02:24:42,270 --> 02:24:44,850
I did that to the Institute of Creation 
Research.

2956
02:24:45,090 --> 02:24:50,090
They got so pissed off.
They blocked me on twitter and that was 

2957
02:24:50,090 --> 02:24:52,890
a badge of fucking honor with the tooth 
for creation research.

2958
02:24:52,920 --> 02:24:57,920
What kind of research do they do?
ICR Dot org is the same thing as like 

2959
02:24:57,920 --> 02:25:01,161
answers in genesis and all that shit.
It's like it's a think tank of creation 

2960
02:25:01,231 --> 02:25:03,720
of scientists that are the earth is 
6,000

2961
02:25:03,721 --> 02:25:08,180
years old are they are the new book of 
beginnings,

2962
02:25:08,190 --> 02:25:10,860
a practical guide to understanding 
genesis.

2963
02:25:10,920 --> 02:25:12,270
Oh yeah.
Shit.

2964
02:25:12,780 --> 02:25:16,870
It looks like the little fucking 
dinosaur on it and look into this.

2965
02:25:16,970 --> 02:25:21,970
Look at this first article.
Magic words can't explain strange 

2966
02:25:21,970 --> 02:25:23,410
fossil.
Once upon a time,

2967
02:25:23,440 --> 02:25:28,440
only a single Italian fossil across 
crushed specimen at paleontologist had 

2968
02:25:29,711 --> 02:25:33,480
to reconstruct represented the extinct 
reptiles.

2969
02:25:33,520 --> 02:25:36,820
The girl was his name.
Direness worth Panna Saurus.

2970
02:25:37,180 --> 02:25:40,630
Now a team of American scientists 
describe a new Japan,

2971
02:25:40,631 --> 02:25:45,631
a sore,
a specimen from New Mexico instead of 

2972
02:25:45,631 --> 02:25:45,631
fingers.

2973
02:25:45,631 --> 02:25:48,580
It had a massive claw on each hand and 
it's curling tail was claude tipped.

2974
02:25:48,640 --> 02:25:53,640
These features have evolutionist 
scratching their heads over where it 

2975
02:25:53,640 --> 02:25:57,961
came from and why it looks more like a 
particular living memo than a reptile.

2976
02:25:58,360 --> 02:25:59,140
Well,
guess what?

2977
02:25:59,320 --> 02:26:04,320
Because mammals existed during the time 
of dinosaurs done tauntaun and you have 

2978
02:26:04,511 --> 02:26:09,511
things like synapsids and things like 
therapsids that are mammals that are 

2979
02:26:09,821 --> 02:26:14,140
reptile or mammal transitions and you 
have all of these things that exist that

2980
02:26:14,141 --> 02:26:19,141
they say don't.
It looks like a bear and a sheep and a 

2981
02:26:19,141 --> 02:26:19,790
slaw had a gang bang.
Right?

2982
02:26:19,900 --> 02:26:23,380
No,
it's totally some like Brian Thomas.

2983
02:26:23,381 --> 02:26:25,480
Really?
He has an Ms.

2984
02:26:26,200 --> 02:26:29,590
He's got a master in science from.
Where did he get that?

2985
02:26:29,800 --> 02:26:31,260
Probably from the,
uh,

2986
02:26:31,300 --> 02:26:34,000
from ICR.
I think you can get one online.

2987
02:26:34,020 --> 02:26:34,670
Yeah.
Yeah.

2988
02:26:34,770 --> 02:26:39,770
No you can.
I want to get one just so I have to be 

2989
02:26:39,770 --> 02:26:39,770
called doctor.

2990
02:26:39,770 --> 02:26:41,010
Like he was doing a lot of the,
I know a lot of,

2991
02:26:41,060 --> 02:26:42,160
uh,
uh,

2992
02:26:42,370 --> 02:26:44,290
homeopathy,
homeopathy,

2993
02:26:44,740 --> 02:26:49,740
people that go and get the homeopathy 
certification and like,

2994
02:26:49,920 --> 02:26:50,770
and then go,
hey look,

2995
02:26:50,800 --> 02:26:55,800
I'm certified to.
I'm allowed to talk to it and we're now 

2996
02:26:55,800 --> 02:26:55,960
on the equal footing.
And then they just like own the,

2997
02:26:56,080 --> 02:26:58,960
the shaken water sugarpill people.
Uh,

2998
02:26:58,961 --> 02:26:59,970
yeah.
Yeah.

2999
02:27:00,020 --> 02:27:05,020
Not not talking about like actual like 
aroma therapy things or things that 

3000
02:27:05,020 --> 02:27:08,821
actually like a like single 
concentrations of Arnica that actually 

3001
02:27:08,821 --> 02:27:11,350
can be used as an antiinflammatory.
I'm talking like the sugar pill,

3002
02:27:11,351 --> 02:27:12,100
Bella,
Donna,

3003
02:27:12,101 --> 02:27:17,101
things that you take because your ci is 
messed up and you can in your ankles,

3004
02:27:18,281 --> 02:27:23,281
so you get like pig bladder and Bella,
Donna together and you're just taking 

3005
02:27:23,281 --> 02:27:27,880
like 40 grams of soluble glucose in a 
sugar pill.

3006
02:27:27,890 --> 02:27:29,500
Makes you feel better and briefly.
Yeah,

3007
02:27:29,501 --> 02:27:30,730
because you're like,
whoa.

3008
02:27:31,280 --> 02:27:33,190
That was amazing medicine.
Yeah.

3009
02:27:33,191 --> 02:27:35,860
Incredible power because I feel the 
spiritual energy because all the,

3010
02:27:35,861 --> 02:27:37,720
you know,
your adp going on in your body.

3011
02:27:37,721 --> 02:27:38,770
It's just like,
hey look,

3012
02:27:38,771 --> 02:27:40,300
we've got food.
I do yoga,

3013
02:27:40,301 --> 02:27:44,950
so I'm around these people all the time.
I'm around a lot of these Topanga Canyon

3014
02:27:44,951 --> 02:27:45,850
hippies.
Wow.

3015
02:27:45,910 --> 02:27:49,090
That believe in all this cookie shit.
It's hilarious.

3016
02:27:49,120 --> 02:27:54,120
Talk to them.
They just have these fucking bizarre 

3017
02:27:54,120 --> 02:27:57,061
ideas.
I've had a couple people come into the 

3018
02:27:57,061 --> 02:27:57,220
bar lately and again I'm saying it's 
like,

3019
02:27:57,221 --> 02:27:58,060
hey,
my birthday soon.

3020
02:27:58,100 --> 02:27:58,810
They're like,
oh,

3021
02:27:58,811 --> 02:27:59,730
when's your birthday?
I'm like,

3022
02:27:59,800 --> 02:28:02,080
it's the 27th,
and they're like,

3023
02:28:02,470 --> 02:28:03,610
oh,
you're a Scorpio.

3024
02:28:04,420 --> 02:28:05,560
Yeah.
What does that mean?

3025
02:28:05,670 --> 02:28:07,840
I've.
I've been called a Scorpio before.

3026
02:28:08,410 --> 02:28:13,410
Whatever.
It's like I'm dark and brooding and 

3027
02:28:13,410 --> 02:28:13,410
narcissistic.
Well,

3028
02:28:13,410 --> 02:28:13,410
yeah,
a little.

3029
02:28:13,410 --> 02:28:15,430
I'm very vengeful,
you know?

3030
02:28:15,431 --> 02:28:18,610
I'm very emotional and things like that.
All those things seem to be true.

3031
02:28:18,640 --> 02:28:23,640
Yeah,
but all those things seem to be human 

3032
02:28:23,640 --> 02:28:23,640
qualities.
No,

3033
02:28:23,640 --> 02:28:23,640
no,
no.

3034
02:28:23,640 --> 02:28:23,640
Just for Scorpios,
just for Scorpions.

3035
02:28:23,830 --> 02:28:24,410
No,
no.

3036
02:28:24,710 --> 02:28:25,730
Pisces.
Pisces,

3037
02:28:25,731 --> 02:28:28,370
or like different.
Very balanced.

3038
02:28:28,490 --> 02:28:33,490
NASA,
your Zodiac sign is wrong according to 

3039
02:28:33,490 --> 02:28:36,101
science,
but it was never based on science 

3040
02:28:36,101 --> 02:28:36,101
anyway.
Yes.

3041
02:28:36,101 --> 02:28:40,200
Well,
what is it based on and how fuck has it 

3042
02:28:40,200 --> 02:28:42,401
been around so long?
That's what's really incredible about 

3043
02:28:42,401 --> 02:28:45,670
astronomy,
but rather because of the ability for 

3044
02:28:45,670 --> 02:28:47,570
the human brain to look at patterns.
We see constellations.

3045
02:28:47,590 --> 02:28:52,590
It's like you.
It's like the same thing with 

3046
02:28:52,590 --> 02:28:52,590
constellation.
Same thing as clowns.

3047
02:28:52,590 --> 02:28:53,090
Oh look,
there's a dinosaur.

3048
02:28:53,120 --> 02:28:53,870
Oh wait,
no.

3049
02:28:53,871 --> 02:28:57,140
Not string into an alligator,
and now it kind of looks like my mom.

3050
02:28:57,141 --> 02:28:58,550
I'm feeling weird because of that.
You know,

3051
02:28:58,551 --> 02:29:01,760
that kind of good friend of mine who I 
really respect telling me that astrology

3052
02:29:01,761 --> 02:29:04,130
is real.
Then he conducts an astrologer before he

3053
02:29:04,131 --> 02:29:08,180
does anything that's important and he 
won't do things with the astrologer,

3054
02:29:08,181 --> 02:29:11,660
tells him that could be dangerous or 
could be problems coming in the future.

3055
02:29:12,020 --> 02:29:12,860
Wow.
Yeah.

3056
02:29:12,861 --> 02:29:14,750
And I was talking to him about it and he
was like,

3057
02:29:14,751 --> 02:29:15,920
well,
the astrologer,

3058
02:29:15,921 --> 02:29:20,921
they told me about my past.
They told me they were right about my 

3059
02:29:20,921 --> 02:29:20,921
parents.
I go,

3060
02:29:20,921 --> 02:29:22,550
don't you know about your parents?
Don't you know,

3061
02:29:22,670 --> 02:29:24,590
like,
why would you be excited if someone told

3062
02:29:24,591 --> 02:29:29,591
you some shit you already knew how to 
tell this motherfucker to tell you some 

3063
02:29:29,591 --> 02:29:29,591
shit you don't know,
you know?

3064
02:29:29,591 --> 02:29:34,060
Tell him to tell you a lottery ticket.
Tell them to tell you what's going to 

3065
02:29:34,060 --> 02:29:34,060
happen next Tuesday.
Then believe him.

3066
02:29:34,060 --> 02:29:37,460
Otherwise what they're probably doing.
Use asking you leading questions.

3067
02:29:37,610 --> 02:29:42,610
You're answering them in a way that 
leads you to believe that they had the 

3068
02:29:42,610 --> 02:29:42,990
information.
Yes.

3069
02:29:43,060 --> 02:29:45,230
It says con man stuff.
It's cold reading.

3070
02:29:45,231 --> 02:29:48,030
It's mediums.
It's hold all of these.

3071
02:29:48,560 --> 02:29:53,560
There's techniques,
training and micro expressions of 

3072
02:29:53,560 --> 02:29:53,650
magicians are fucking excellent.
Adam.

3073
02:29:53,651 --> 02:29:54,720
Oh hell yeah,
man.

3074
02:29:54,760 --> 02:29:59,760
I mean I.
I'm a really good friend of mine is a 

3075
02:29:59,760 --> 02:30:03,040
misty Lee.
She's the only female medium at the 

3076
02:30:03,040 --> 02:30:05,321
magic castle and she's Rad and we were 
just talking one day and she's like,

3077
02:30:05,390 --> 02:30:07,030
Oh yeah,
I can speak with the dead.

3078
02:30:07,160 --> 02:30:12,160
I can find anything out.
Just by doing that kind of is like 

3079
02:30:12,160 --> 02:30:15,230
magicians.
There's entire books written on this and

3080
02:30:15,231 --> 02:30:17,270
I've watched.
I've watched penn and teller do it.

3081
02:30:17,271 --> 02:30:22,271
I've watched Uri Geller do it the whole 
deal and it's if you work in enough and 

3082
02:30:24,080 --> 02:30:29,080
magicians have the type of mentality and
patience and discipline to do this over 

3083
02:30:29,840 --> 02:30:34,840
and over and over again.
Shuffling cards a thousand times a day 

3084
02:30:34,840 --> 02:30:37,250
until it's just rote memorization.
They can do that with cold reading.

3085
02:30:37,251 --> 02:30:39,890
They can do that with predictions.
They can do that with math tables,

3086
02:30:40,400 --> 02:30:43,140
deep boone bending,
all that stuff.

3087
02:30:43,220 --> 02:30:44,300
They know to do all that.

3088
02:30:44,510 --> 02:30:49,510
That's easy.
You get a spoon with a little bit 

3089
02:30:49,510 --> 02:30:51,311
gallium and it melts when,
as soon as you touch it with your inner 

3090
02:30:51,311 --> 02:30:52,970
guru or gallium gallium.
It's a metal that actually melts,

3091
02:30:52,971 --> 02:30:53,660
uh,
with,

3092
02:30:53,720 --> 02:30:55,820
uh,
your simple body heat really,

3093
02:30:55,970 --> 02:30:58,640
and you make spoons out of it.
That's the common thing.

3094
02:30:58,641 --> 02:31:01,750
I'm not spoiling any magic trick,
so it looks like a spoon.

3095
02:31:01,751 --> 02:31:03,500
It's made out of metal,
like regular metal,

3096
02:31:03,501 --> 02:31:06,140
but it's actually made out of gallium 
and just sort of rub it.

3097
02:31:06,350 --> 02:31:08,720
You Rub it and it melts and the thing 
falls apart yet.

3098
02:31:08,750 --> 02:31:11,120
Check it up.
Disappearing spoons.

3099
02:31:12,110 --> 02:31:13,730
Okay,
so this guy's got a spoon,

3100
02:31:13,790 --> 02:31:15,770
doesn't that it looks like a normal to 
do it yourself.

3101
02:31:15,771 --> 02:31:19,650
Kit and gallium metal metal available.
Sounds like a spoon.

3102
02:31:19,680 --> 02:31:24,680
So that's a thing of hot water dot.
Oh Jesus.

3103
02:31:25,621 --> 02:31:28,950
The spoon dissolved in the water because
it's hot enough.

3104
02:31:28,951 --> 02:31:29,910
It's,
it's a,

3105
02:31:30,150 --> 02:31:33,210
it's a low yield temperature.
This is not an acid.

3106
02:31:33,211 --> 02:31:38,211
It's water melting.
Point of gallium is only 86 degrees 

3107
02:31:38,211 --> 02:31:38,211
Fahrenheit.
That's incredible.

3108
02:31:38,211 --> 02:31:38,211
Yeah.
What's,

3109
02:31:38,211 --> 02:31:39,720
what's your outer skin?
Body temperature.

3110
02:31:39,960 --> 02:31:40,800
Oh,
96.

3111
02:31:40,801 --> 02:31:43,770
So that's incredible.
So you can take a hot water,

3112
02:31:44,220 --> 02:31:49,220
so your fingers,
you could easily been that spoon and 

3113
02:31:49,220 --> 02:31:50,640
just rubbing it or not even that hot 
that it would hurt you.

3114
02:31:50,670 --> 02:31:55,410
Or if that's an opaque mug.
If I'm a gallium spoon,

3115
02:31:56,160 --> 02:31:57,930
I do that.
You can't look through the mug.

3116
02:31:58,860 --> 02:32:01,010
The spoon disappears and it melts away.

3117
02:32:01,810 --> 02:32:02,770
Oh,

3118
02:32:03,030 --> 02:32:03,670
that's.
Yeah,

3119
02:32:03,750 --> 02:32:05,450
that's,
that's a very simple one.

3120
02:32:05,451 --> 02:32:07,660
And you know,
bending spoons like that.

3121
02:32:07,661 --> 02:32:10,090
Yeah.
So they just rub it and the gallium just

3122
02:32:10,091 --> 02:32:15,091
sort of bends or there's a wave shit.
There's a way to pinch it between your 

3123
02:32:15,091 --> 02:32:19,231
fingers and start rubbing it and you're 
actually working it back and forth just 

3124
02:32:19,231 --> 02:32:21,080
a little bit like bending a key when you
like it.

3125
02:32:21,280 --> 02:32:23,240
We've all done it.
We've all rubbed a keen.

3126
02:32:23,260 --> 02:32:26,920
We've watched it start to bend because 
as you are heating it up,

3127
02:32:26,950 --> 02:32:29,470
it is expanding its Oh,
is that?

3128
02:32:29,471 --> 02:32:30,550
Yeah,
there's the mold.

3129
02:32:30,670 --> 02:32:33,640
Check it out.
What's happening here?

3130
02:32:34,120 --> 02:32:36,100
They're making,
they're messing with gallium.

3131
02:32:36,101 --> 02:32:41,101
You can make a mold of it and then you 
put it in your freezer eight hours 

3132
02:32:41,101 --> 02:32:41,101
later.

3133
02:32:42,640 --> 02:32:45,430
Oh Wow.
This is so bizarre.

3134
02:32:45,610 --> 02:32:46,870
Yeah,
it's tough.

3135
02:32:46,871 --> 02:32:48,820
Just breaks in your face.
It's neat stuff,

3136
02:32:48,821 --> 02:32:49,980
man.
What did.

3137
02:32:50,260 --> 02:32:53,710
Whereas gallium from it's part of the 
periodic table,

3138
02:32:53,711 --> 02:32:57,580
it's a existing element until they find 
it in dirt and extract it.

3139
02:32:58,210 --> 02:33:00,550
You can mine it.
I've lived 49 years.

3140
02:33:00,551 --> 02:33:02,410
I've never heard of gallium to this 
moment.

3141
02:33:02,830 --> 02:33:04,690
You're welcome.
Just thank you very much.

3142
02:33:05,010 --> 02:33:08,140
You should feel good about.
That's the entire point of your show.

3143
02:33:08,170 --> 02:33:09,730
You learn shit.
That's what do.

3144
02:33:09,760 --> 02:33:11,950
That's why I've always been a fan.
Well,

3145
02:33:11,951 --> 02:33:12,610
thank you.
Yeah.

3146
02:33:12,611 --> 02:33:13,810
I mean,
listen,

3147
02:33:14,050 --> 02:33:19,050
I'm a fan of the show too because it 
allows me to have these conversations 

3148
02:33:19,271 --> 02:33:24,271
with people.
Like I'm saying that I'm not being 

3149
02:33:24,271 --> 02:33:24,370
facetious like as a,
as a person who's in the show,

3150
02:33:24,580 --> 02:33:27,550
like I'm a fan of being able to be able 
to talk all these people.

3151
02:33:27,551 --> 02:33:29,620
Like you learned about gallium.

3152
02:33:30,130 --> 02:33:31,750
It's cool.
Metal bending spoons.

3153
02:33:31,960 --> 02:33:36,960
There's so many different tricks that 
magicians use that psychics and all 

3154
02:33:36,960 --> 02:33:40,471
they're really sleazy people have been 
using to steal from people like these 

3155
02:33:40,471 --> 02:33:42,190
goddamn mediums on television that you 
see that.

3156
02:33:42,420 --> 02:33:45,460
What was that Long Island medium?
Did you ever see that one yet?

3157
02:33:45,461 --> 02:33:46,660
No.
What was the Big Guy?

3158
02:33:46,750 --> 02:33:50,760
The dude that had the TV show?
Oh yeah.

3159
02:33:50,820 --> 02:33:53,650
Our started like Robert Richard Byrd 
something.

3160
02:33:54,280 --> 02:33:59,280
What was that fucking guys name?
He had the same name as somebody else 

3161
02:33:59,280 --> 02:33:59,280
that's famous,
right?

3162
02:33:59,280 --> 02:33:59,280
Yeah.
Yeah,

3163
02:33:59,280 --> 02:34:03,600
and he would use plants and wireless 
mikes and audio amplifiers and cold 

3164
02:34:05,171 --> 02:34:09,700
reading to read his audience shit.
Oh yeah,

3165
02:34:09,701 --> 02:34:11,320
that's right.
That's right.

3166
02:34:11,370 --> 02:34:16,370
He had that Scifi show on Scifi,
like beyond with rural,

3167
02:34:16,710 --> 02:34:18,370
whatever is his fucking

3168
02:34:18,370 --> 02:34:23,370
name.
Thankfully we have forgotten he has 

3169
02:34:23,370 --> 02:34:25,920
fallen into obscurity,
but that piece of shit was famous for a 

3170
02:34:25,920 --> 02:34:26,410
long time and people would talk about 
them all the time.

3171
02:34:26,520 --> 02:34:28,660
Yeah.
He started with specials and then he got

3172
02:34:28,661 --> 02:34:32,440
his own damn show like that done.
What's his name?

3173
02:34:32,441 --> 02:34:34,510
Jamie James Van Praagh?
No,

3174
02:34:34,900 --> 02:34:36,220
no.
There was another one.

3175
02:34:37,070 --> 02:34:41,050
It was fucking people right now are 
screaming it on twitter.

3176
02:34:41,500 --> 02:34:46,500
Probably this guy.
Yeah.

3177
02:34:49,241 --> 02:34:50,860
There's a lot of those fuck heads out 
there,

3178
02:34:50,861 --> 02:34:55,861
but again,
just like the flat earth people and all 

3179
02:34:55,861 --> 02:34:56,440
this other nonsense,
I think they're going to exist less than

3180
02:34:56,500 --> 02:34:59,190
less and less in the future.
You know?

3181
02:34:59,200 --> 02:35:02,140
I think that what we're seeing right now
in terms of confirmation bias,

3182
02:35:02,740 --> 02:35:07,740
I think that's all going to be 
eradicated because I think what we're 

3183
02:35:07,740 --> 02:35:07,740
dealing with now is very limited mediums
of draw,

3184
02:35:07,740 --> 02:35:09,550
of writing things down,
typing things,

3185
02:35:09,551 --> 02:35:10,810
making videos about things.

3186
02:35:11,080 --> 02:35:15,770
All of these things are incredibly 
limited in comparison to,

3187
02:35:15,771 --> 02:35:16,870
well,
what's coming up,

3188
02:35:17,230 --> 02:35:18,240
you know,
I've been a,

3189
02:35:18,241 --> 02:35:23,210
I'm a follower of Ray Kurzweil for 
awhile.

3190
02:35:23,250 --> 02:35:26,740
I'm trying to pay attention to what he 
predicts in what he's,

3191
02:35:27,280 --> 02:35:30,280
what he's thinking is going to be coming
down the pipe and 20,

3192
02:35:30,281 --> 02:35:35,281
45 and you look at guys like him and all
of these futurists that are predicting 

3193
02:35:35,281 --> 02:35:40,231
all these emergent technologies are 
going to completely change and revamp 

3194
02:35:40,231 --> 02:35:41,950
the way we communicate going into the 
singularity.

3195
02:35:41,990 --> 02:35:44,140
Yeah,
I think we're on the.

3196
02:35:44,170 --> 02:35:46,860
We're on the verge of a storm,
uh,

3197
02:35:46,940 --> 02:35:51,940
in innovation storm that's going to 
render the landscape almost 

3198
02:35:51,940 --> 02:35:55,141
unrecognizable.
I think we're just a decade or two away 

3199
02:35:55,141 --> 02:35:55,450
from just massive,
massive shifts.

3200
02:35:55,840 --> 02:35:57,640
It brings me back to,
you know,

3201
02:35:57,641 --> 02:36:02,641
I'm not a,
I don't believe that the Mayans were 

3202
02:36:02,641 --> 02:36:03,610
correct at December 21st 2012 was the 
end of the world,

3203
02:36:03,611 --> 02:36:08,611
but it is fascinating when you see like 
the Kali Yugas and all the different,

3204
02:36:08,890 --> 02:36:13,890
the different ancient civilizations that
predicted cycles and cycles of humanity 

3205
02:36:13,890 --> 02:36:16,450
and it kind of seems like there's 
something to that,

3206
02:36:16,720 --> 02:36:21,720
like maybe almost like you can kind of 
predict a sort of a time period where 

3207
02:36:23,171 --> 02:36:25,900
people accumulate a bunch of 
information,

3208
02:36:25,901 --> 02:36:27,880
makes,
make life safer for each other,

3209
02:36:27,881 --> 02:36:32,350
but then get soft,
soft and sort of sloppy because life got

3210
02:36:32,351 --> 02:36:35,500
safe and when you get lazy and then,
you know,

3211
02:36:35,501 --> 02:36:38,890
uh,
all sorts of weird behavior.

3212
02:36:38,990 --> 02:36:40,600
Like that's what we always thought about
Rome.

3213
02:36:40,601 --> 02:36:43,540
Right?
And we will start the decadence and the,

3214
02:36:44,470 --> 02:36:47,950
and we know the vomitorium Amelia's,
do you know what it really is?

3215
02:36:48,230 --> 02:36:49,590
That's the,
the,

3216
02:36:49,810 --> 02:36:52,570
well,
at least I've always been the learn that

3217
02:36:52,571 --> 02:36:57,571
it's the kind of like the closed in Bach
and all festival where you go and you,

3218
02:36:58,150 --> 02:37:00,780
it's a sauna and you eat a bunch and you
do the whole thing.

3219
02:37:00,790 --> 02:37:04,520
I'm gonna help you out here.
Vomitorium vomitorium is,

3220
02:37:04,521 --> 02:37:05,920
is actually the,
the,

3221
02:37:06,010 --> 02:37:11,010
the passage way between a large arena 
and the stands.

3222
02:37:11,470 --> 02:37:15,250
So the way people leave when they leave,
that's the vomitorium,

3223
02:37:15,610 --> 02:37:19,670
but the name of it led people to infer 
that these that's vomitorium.

3224
02:37:20,030 --> 02:37:21,950
So lead people to infer that,
oh,

3225
02:37:21,951 --> 02:37:24,210
that was a place that we'd go to throw 
up the.

3226
02:37:24,211 --> 02:37:26,030
No,
it's totally owned on that.

3227
02:37:26,360 --> 02:37:27,140
Right on.
Thank you.

3228
02:37:27,200 --> 02:37:29,330
But it's,
it's one that I thought too.

3229
02:37:29,390 --> 02:37:30,580
And then,
you know,

3230
02:37:30,590 --> 02:37:35,000
you always connect that to ancient Rome.
And I went to the Vatican.

3231
02:37:35,001 --> 02:37:39,110
I went to Rome this past summer and I 
went to the colosseum and go there.

3232
02:37:39,300 --> 02:37:40,610
Fucking dope,
dude.

3233
02:37:40,611 --> 02:37:43,580
It's the Vatican is the dopest Shit I've
ever seen in my life.

3234
02:37:43,820 --> 02:37:48,820
It's so insanely massive and spectacular
and the construction is just so mind 

3235
02:37:50,271 --> 02:37:55,271
blowing.
The fact that they did all this without 

3236
02:37:55,271 --> 02:37:55,820
power tools,
they did all over the course of hundreds

3237
02:37:55,820 --> 02:37:56,930
of years.
They built these amazing,

3238
02:37:56,931 --> 02:37:57,670
massive strokes

3239
02:37:57,730 --> 02:38:02,730
teachers.
I did the same thing in Israel a couple 

3240
02:38:02,730 --> 02:38:02,730
of years ago,
like,

3241
02:38:02,730 --> 02:38:05,350
like going to Jerusalem and seeing,
holy shit,

3242
02:38:05,351 --> 02:38:10,351
this is like Herod built this wow and 
going to Masada and all that.

3243
02:38:10,601 --> 02:38:13,770
It was trippy as fuck,
dude can only imagine.

3244
02:38:13,771 --> 02:38:15,490
It's like and walking through the 
different quarter,

3245
02:38:15,500 --> 02:38:16,010
uh,
uh,

3246
02:38:16,160 --> 02:38:21,160
you know,
the different quarters in Jerusalem and 

3247
02:38:21,160 --> 02:38:23,131
everything and almost walking up the 
wrong stairs and the Muslim quarter to 

3248
02:38:23,131 --> 02:38:23,131
get to the,
a dome on the rock.

3249
02:38:23,131 --> 02:38:25,420
I didn't know where I was.
This big dudes like,

3250
02:38:25,421 --> 02:38:26,700
you're not Muslim.
You're not going there.

3251
02:38:26,730 --> 02:38:27,910
I'm like,
oh wow.

3252
02:38:28,060 --> 02:38:31,270
So you've go the wrong way and you can't
go if you're a Muslim,

3253
02:38:31,300 --> 02:38:32,450
you,
unless you're a Muslim less,

3254
02:38:32,460 --> 02:38:33,430
you're a Muslim.
Yeah.

3255
02:38:33,850 --> 02:38:34,820
Because the,
the,

3256
02:38:34,821 --> 02:38:37,180
the Dome on the rock where the mosque 
and everything is,

3257
02:38:37,181 --> 02:38:42,181
is for Muslims only.
They only open it think one day a year 

3258
02:38:42,181 --> 02:38:44,110
very briefly for people to come,
like take a picture of the outside.

3259
02:38:44,560 --> 02:38:46,750
Occasionally film crews can go in there,
but that's about it.

3260
02:38:47,500 --> 02:38:49,360
And it's like,
unless you were devout Muslim,

3261
02:38:49,361 --> 02:38:54,361
you can't go in there.
And because it's a very holy site for 

3262
02:38:54,361 --> 02:38:57,061
them and,
but going there like going and seeing a,

3263
02:38:57,460 --> 02:38:59,290
like a,
uh,

3264
02:38:59,291 --> 02:39:02,500
the stations of the cross and the Church
of the Holy Sepulchre and all that,

3265
02:39:02,501 --> 02:39:04,030
it was trippy.
I'm not an,

3266
02:39:04,390 --> 02:39:09,390
I'm not religious,
I'm not an atheist or anything like 

3267
02:39:09,390 --> 02:39:09,390
that.
I'm just,

3268
02:39:09,390 --> 02:39:09,390
I'm a scientist.
I'm an apathy as died.

3269
02:39:09,970 --> 02:39:14,970
It's a absolutely.
The religious aspect and spiritual 

3270
02:39:14,970 --> 02:39:15,850
aspect to me is completely irrelevant if
there's a,

3271
02:39:15,851 --> 02:39:20,851
you cannot prove nor deny that there is 
any kind of outside force or you know,

3272
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:24,220
three o being and all of that.
I don't,

3273
02:39:24,280 --> 02:39:26,360
I honestly don't give a shit.
Uh,

3274
02:39:26,710 --> 02:39:29,470
if I die and all of a sudden it's like,
oops,

3275
02:39:29,710 --> 02:39:30,550
sorry.
Okay.

3276
02:39:30,790 --> 02:39:32,020
No,
I admit I was wrong.

3277
02:39:32,020 --> 02:39:32,860
Send me to hell.
Sorry.

3278
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:36,280
I don't care what you think that God 
would be like,

3279
02:39:36,281 --> 02:39:37,330
hey man,
you didn't know.

3280
02:39:38,140 --> 02:39:41,500
But I've always been honest about that 
because people are like,

3281
02:39:41,501 --> 02:39:42,430
you're an atheist.
I'm like,

3282
02:39:42,460 --> 02:39:43,090
actually,
no,

3283
02:39:43,091 --> 02:39:44,920
I'm not sorry.
Yeah.

3284
02:39:44,921 --> 02:39:47,560
An atheist has to have a belief that 
there's no god.

3285
02:39:47,740 --> 02:39:49,420
You have to.
You have to believe there's,

3286
02:39:50,340 --> 02:39:51,430
there's,
you don't.

3287
02:39:51,740 --> 02:39:55,480
You don't know if there's no god because
you've never experienced death.

3288
02:39:55,540 --> 02:40:00,540
It's you don't know if there's no 
afterlife because you've never 

3289
02:40:00,540 --> 02:40:00,540
experienced it.
The the,

3290
02:40:00,540 --> 02:40:03,420
the is no evidence that exists.
The definitely.

3291
02:40:03,430 --> 02:40:07,060
I know a lot of atheists that use the 
definition that you have.

3292
02:40:07,061 --> 02:40:10,000
Agnosticism and atheism.
Agnosticism is the knowledge.

3293
02:40:10,150 --> 02:40:15,150
Atheism is the empirical data,
so an atheist knows there is no god and 

3294
02:40:15,670 --> 02:40:20,670
disbeliefs all God.
The only difference between a atheist 

3295
02:40:20,670 --> 02:40:24,741
and a Christian is that the atheist 
disbelieves one more than the Christian 

3296
02:40:24,760 --> 02:40:28,710
because if you think about it,
because in disbelief scientologists,

3297
02:40:28,711 --> 02:40:29,910
they disbelieve the moonies.

3298
02:40:29,910 --> 02:40:32,280
They displayed the Unitarians,
all of that.

3299
02:40:32,700 --> 02:40:37,020
So an agnostic is lacking knowledge.
You don't.

3300
02:40:37,340 --> 02:40:38,850
You don't really know.
It's like,

3301
02:40:38,851 --> 02:40:40,200
okay,
well I've seen some things.

3302
02:40:40,201 --> 02:40:41,940
I haven't seen other things.
That kind of deal.

3303
02:40:42,690 --> 02:40:47,690
I removed myself from that and the 
hardcore atheist community has tried to 

3304
02:40:47,690 --> 02:40:49,320
grasp apathy ism as,
Oh,

3305
02:40:49,321 --> 02:40:52,140
it's practical atheism so you don't 
bother.

3306
02:40:52,141 --> 02:40:53,010
You don't care,
and it's like,

3307
02:40:53,011 --> 02:40:58,011
no,
we don't care because it's a waste of 

3308
02:40:58,011 --> 02:40:58,011
fucking time.
Yeah.

3309
02:40:58,011 --> 02:40:59,400
I had a argument with a guy on twitter 
once was a twitter,

3310
02:40:59,700 --> 02:41:01,720
one of those things where he was,
um,

3311
02:41:02,010 --> 02:41:07,010
he was saying,
why don't you just come out as an 

3312
02:41:07,010 --> 02:41:07,010
atheist like,
well,

3313
02:41:07,010 --> 02:41:07,250
why do you care?
Why?

3314
02:41:07,251 --> 02:41:12,251
Why do you care?
Why do you want me to say there's No 

3315
02:41:12,251 --> 02:41:12,251
God?
Why would you want me to say that?

3316
02:41:12,251 --> 02:41:12,360
First of all,
I don't know.

3317
02:41:12,510 --> 02:41:13,560
And I've said I don't know.

3318
02:41:13,710 --> 02:41:18,710
And you don't know either bitch.
So why are you telling me that I should 

3319
02:41:18,710 --> 02:41:18,710
say that.
I know,

3320
02:41:18,710 --> 02:41:19,270
right?
But you don't know this is,

3321
02:41:19,390 --> 02:41:24,390
this is crazy talk,
but it's one of those goddamn things 

3322
02:41:24,390 --> 02:41:24,510
where people want you to be on their 
team.

3323
02:41:24,511 --> 02:41:25,500
Yeah,
absolutely.

3324
02:41:25,501 --> 02:41:26,130
It's like,
oh,

3325
02:41:26,131 --> 02:41:26,520
hey,
cool.

3326
02:41:26,521 --> 02:41:28,770
We have a celebrity endorsement.
That's exactly what it is.

3327
02:41:29,040 --> 02:41:32,580
It's exactly what it is.
Joe Rogan said he was an atheist.

3328
02:41:32,670 --> 02:41:35,780
So all the atheists go on the part of 
the atheist society.

3329
02:41:35,800 --> 02:41:37,380
We get together,
right?

3330
02:41:38,030 --> 02:41:43,030
That's happened with the skeptics.
There used to be these skeptics society 

3331
02:41:43,030 --> 02:41:46,650
and then they got weird and then they 
got all social justice Warrior II,

3332
02:41:46,651 --> 02:41:51,651
and then they started accusing each 
other of raping each other because they 

3333
02:41:51,651 --> 02:41:51,780
were having sex while they were drunk 
and it all got madness.

3334
02:41:51,800 --> 02:41:55,260
It's a lot of is falling apart in a 
bunch of people won't go to their events

3335
02:41:55,261 --> 02:41:57,890
anymore because they were accused of 
impropriety and,

3336
02:41:58,160 --> 02:42:00,660
and then you have new ones like in,
uh,

3337
02:42:00,760 --> 02:42:01,890
uh,
across the pond.

3338
02:42:01,890 --> 02:42:03,750
You've got like qed con and stuff like 
that.

3339
02:42:03,751 --> 02:42:06,660
They're actually doing it like the old 
school.

3340
02:42:06,661 --> 02:42:11,661
It's like a bunch of people are meeting 
up and talking about things and they 

3341
02:42:11,661 --> 02:42:12,150
have panels and they have like zero 
tolerance,

3342
02:42:12,180 --> 02:42:13,700
a law,
uh,

3343
02:42:13,710 --> 02:42:15,800
you know,
zero tolerance rules for the convention,

3344
02:42:15,820 --> 02:42:18,030
stuff like that.
And that's the zero tolerance for what,

3345
02:42:18,230 --> 02:42:20,640
for like sexual harassment or anything 
like no means,

3346
02:42:20,641 --> 02:42:23,520
no consent laws and guidelines and all 
that.

3347
02:42:23,790 --> 02:42:25,330
And it's really cool.
Um,

3348
02:42:25,360 --> 02:42:28,560
they need that at conferences.
Isn't that just common human nature?

3349
02:42:28,650 --> 02:42:30,510
They needed somebody,
they needed some.

3350
02:42:30,540 --> 02:42:33,570
Well it is and a majority of people 
should know that.

3351
02:42:33,571 --> 02:42:34,780
But then we have,
you know,

3352
02:42:34,800 --> 02:42:35,640
rape,
advocating,

3353
02:42:35,641 --> 02:42:38,100
fuckwits that run for president.
Um,

3354
02:42:38,490 --> 02:42:41,850
so he's in the pussy grabbing but still 
rape advocation.

3355
02:42:41,851 --> 02:42:46,851
He's absolutely advocating the abuse and
rape the locker room talk or shifts in 

3356
02:42:47,880 --> 02:42:49,710
the locker room.
I played fucking hockey.

3357
02:42:49,711 --> 02:42:52,420
I played football.
I've never been in a locker room,

3358
02:42:52,460 --> 02:42:56,400
first of all.
No he has not.

3359
02:42:56,880 --> 02:42:59,220
And it's like,
yeah,

3360
02:42:59,221 --> 02:43:04,221
it's absolutely just put.
So like there's a big thing every year 

3361
02:43:04,221 --> 02:43:06,180
I'm a,
I'm a guest at a dragon con.

3362
02:43:06,181 --> 02:43:08,360
It's a pop culture con in Atlanta.
Right.

3363
02:43:08,580 --> 02:43:12,280
And because it's all fan run and they 
have different programming tracks

3364
02:43:12,610 --> 02:43:15,110
that I go talk on the science track,
you know,

3365
02:43:15,120 --> 02:43:17,620
talk about beer and cooking or 
dinosaurs,

3366
02:43:17,660 --> 02:43:20,590
or two years ago I ripped apart Jurassic
world,

3367
02:43:20,980 --> 02:43:22,840
stuff like that.
And like Jurassic world,

3368
02:43:22,841 --> 02:43:24,160
fuck no,
but dude,

3369
02:43:24,340 --> 02:43:27,040
the people that you loved made it to the
end and lived.

3370
02:43:27,100 --> 02:43:31,480
That's the best part about the movie,
that Chris Guy and a beautiful girl.

3371
02:43:31,520 --> 02:43:34,100
It was really,
really bad monster.

3372
02:43:34,120 --> 02:43:37,210
It was really good because the little 
kids didn't die either.

3373
02:43:37,600 --> 02:43:39,850
Those kids made it.
Are their parents back together?

3374
02:43:39,880 --> 02:43:44,880
The dinosaurs were running after the 
kids and the kids got away from the 

3375
02:43:44,880 --> 02:43:45,670
dinosaurs and survive.
That's a good movie.

3376
02:43:45,940 --> 02:43:48,100
They hid behind the jeep.
Good job.

3377
02:43:48,101 --> 02:43:51,070
Their dinosaur didn't get him even 
though he smelled them.

3378
02:43:51,071 --> 02:43:55,150
You can't put a smile on that or you can
not hold character in good movie.

3379
02:43:55,480 --> 02:43:56,590
First of all,
what's that guy's name?

3380
02:43:56,591 --> 02:43:57,880
Chris Pratt.

3381
02:43:58,030 --> 02:44:01,450
Pratt is a beautiful man.
I'm happy he lived and the girl,

3382
02:44:01,451 --> 02:44:04,000
they wound up being boyfriend and 
girlfriend at the end of the movie.

3383
02:44:04,001 --> 02:44:06,370
So it's a good movie.
Who saw that comment?

3384
02:44:06,490 --> 02:44:11,490
Who saw that beautiful man in the 
beautiful girl getting together at the 

3385
02:44:11,490 --> 02:44:14,281
end?
Especially through the movie when they 

3386
02:44:14,281 --> 02:44:14,281
shot it at the beginning,
but no,

3387
02:44:14,281 --> 02:44:15,610
they joked about that.
They went on a date before.

3388
02:44:15,611 --> 02:44:17,670
So of course,
you know the stressful situ.

3389
02:44:17,671 --> 02:44:19,750
We look at,
look at speed and plus he said,

3390
02:44:19,751 --> 02:44:21,040
ah,
I didn't watch that movie.

3391
02:44:21,070 --> 02:44:24,880
Didn't have any dinosaurs in it,
but the data just don't exist.

3392
02:44:25,010 --> 02:44:29,970
They're only in movies.
I'm super intelligent.

3393
02:44:29,980 --> 02:44:33,130
Dinosaur crushes that little thing that 
they're in,

3394
02:44:33,280 --> 02:44:36,370
but they managed to slip out the bottom 
and the dinosaur doesn't say it and then

3395
02:44:36,371 --> 02:44:39,160
they run off.
It's boiler spoiler.

3396
02:44:39,161 --> 02:44:40,930
These little kids,
a tiny little stubby,

3397
02:44:40,931 --> 02:44:43,530
shitty human legs can outright.

3398
02:44:43,530 --> 02:44:48,530
A fucking dinosaur.
The size of a building size of a five 

3399
02:44:48,530 --> 02:44:50,210
story building.
There's things screaming and Taran trees

3400
02:44:50,211 --> 02:44:55,211
a heart and he's on a fucking death run 
to get at these little kids for some 

3401
02:44:55,211 --> 02:44:55,330
reason.
Yeah.

3402
02:44:55,331 --> 02:44:59,800
With all the other dinosaurs and shit.
So you gotta eat those gigantic head.

3403
02:44:59,801 --> 02:45:02,290
You just want to eat these little tiny 
people that are barely a snack.

3404
02:45:02,430 --> 02:45:02,940
Right?
Right.

3405
02:45:02,950 --> 02:45:04,690
It's like you chasing after an aunt like
that.

3406
02:45:04,710 --> 02:45:05,990
That fucking man.
I did it.

3407
02:45:06,070 --> 02:45:07,720
That one right there.
That motherfucker.

3408
02:45:08,370 --> 02:45:09,790
Yeah.
That was a good movie.

3409
02:45:10,490 --> 02:45:15,490
A good movie.
It was good at the end to where all the 

3410
02:45:15,490 --> 02:45:15,490
daniels came in and pick people up.
Uh,

3411
02:45:15,490 --> 02:45:16,880
yeah.
And Jimmy Buffet with the cameo running.

3412
02:45:17,200 --> 02:45:18,430
Jimmy Buffett was in that.
Yeah.

3413
02:45:18,490 --> 02:45:23,490
So they have Jimmy Buffett's 
Margaritaville stand at the thing when 

3414
02:45:24,010 --> 02:45:24,760
the,
uh,

3415
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:30,000
when the dimorphic dons and the horrible
dimorphic Don's in the really shitty 

3416
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:30,000
trended ons come out.

3417
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:32,080
Wait a minute that we've seen the same 
movie.

3418
02:45:32,081 --> 02:45:33,340
Yeah.
They can't lift people up.

3419
02:45:33,341 --> 02:45:35,590
I'm sorry.
It's my job.

3420
02:45:35,620 --> 02:45:40,100
I can't imagine a movie like that.
Plausible deniability where tools.

3421
02:45:40,420 --> 02:45:45,420
What's the terra dactyl?
The Tabernacle is a species of Toronto 

3422
02:45:45,420 --> 02:45:45,420
on.
Okay.

3423
02:45:45,420 --> 02:45:45,420
So those Taran and Don's,
there were,

3424
02:45:45,420 --> 02:45:47,650
there was wrongly campy pick people up.
No,

3425
02:45:48,070 --> 02:45:53,070
they weigh less than most people.
How much they weigh maybe somewhere 

3426
02:45:53,070 --> 02:45:54,460
around the small ones,
like 75 pounds.

3427
02:45:55,240 --> 02:46:00,240
And they don't have the foot strength.
They have the foot strength in order to 

3428
02:46:00,240 --> 02:46:02,110
hold their body up.
The thrust to weight ratio,

3429
02:46:02,111 --> 02:46:03,490
man,
they can't reach down.

3430
02:46:03,491 --> 02:46:06,790
They don't have the grip to grab an 
eagle that can grab a sandwich.

3431
02:46:06,820 --> 02:46:07,630
No,
no,

3432
02:46:07,980 --> 02:46:08,320
no,
no.

3433
02:46:08,440 --> 02:46:10,190
Different sort build.
Totally different

3434
02:46:10,190 --> 02:46:11,130
build.
They got.

3435
02:46:11,150 --> 02:46:12,800
Sorry.
They got fucked by evolution.

3436
02:46:13,130 --> 02:46:14,720
Did they have feathers?
Those fuckers?

3437
02:46:15,310 --> 02:46:16,690
Possibly.
Um,

3438
02:46:17,240 --> 02:46:22,240
okay.
Now I have to say a couple things in 

3439
02:46:22,240 --> 02:46:22,240
your ESCO world.
We're Kinda cool.

3440
02:46:22,240 --> 02:46:22,240
Like the most pat's face.
No,

3441
02:46:23,030 --> 02:46:24,800
I liked it more than covers girlfriend's
face.

3442
02:46:25,310 --> 02:46:26,030
Okay.
Now bryce,

3443
02:46:26,031 --> 02:46:28,580
Dallas,
Dallas breakdown was Kinda hot.

3444
02:46:28,700 --> 02:46:33,700
She's even going to fall behind a high.
What do you have high standards you 

3445
02:46:33,700 --> 02:46:33,700
fuck?
Well,

3446
02:46:33,700 --> 02:46:33,700
no,
she's who are,

3447
02:46:33,700 --> 02:46:35,180
you know she's even hotter in the marsh 
and I have to say,

3448
02:46:35,210 --> 02:46:36,050
oh,
the marsh.

3449
02:46:36,080 --> 02:46:38,690
Absolutely beautiful machine.
The marsh.

3450
02:46:38,691 --> 02:46:41,830
He's the commander of the areas for 
mission expression.

3451
02:46:42,080 --> 02:46:42,570
They,
they.

3452
02:46:42,600 --> 02:46:44,060
They went crazy.
Science fiction.

3453
02:46:44,061 --> 02:46:46,550
They have a chicken control.
Let's just,

3454
02:46:46,610 --> 02:46:50,180
let's just do this.
Just go off the deep end.

3455
02:46:51,120 --> 02:46:52,850
Believable.
That's not cool.

3456
02:46:52,860 --> 02:46:57,370
Social Joel's to US interests over 
household.

3457
02:46:57,380 --> 02:47:00,290
A little bit of it at that.
Okay.

3458
02:47:00,350 --> 02:47:02,900
About that term.
Social Justice Warrior.

3459
02:47:02,930 --> 02:47:04,220
Yeah.
It's wonderful term.

3460
02:47:04,250 --> 02:47:09,250
It can also be used for the opposite.
The people that are going for no 

3461
02:47:09,250 --> 02:47:13,451
political correctness,
that people that are going on that they 

3462
02:47:13,451 --> 02:47:15,320
want social justice on their side.
They are also social justice warriors.

3463
02:47:17,330 --> 02:47:19,400
They're looking for,
but that's not going to stick.

3464
02:47:19,401 --> 02:47:22,400
That's how white people honkies doesn't 
hurt.

3465
02:47:25,650 --> 02:47:28,400
Have you called someone to mock social 
justice warriors?

3466
02:47:28,550 --> 02:47:31,730
A social justice warrior two because 
you're trying to.

3467
02:47:31,880 --> 02:47:34,070
You're trying to eliminate all political
rectus.

3468
02:47:34,080 --> 02:47:35,750
You're social justice war they have.
Okay.

3469
02:47:35,751 --> 02:47:36,560
Whatever,
Dude.

02:47:36,590 --> 02:47:36,970
No,

3471
02:47:36,971 --> 02:47:40,700
I haven't had them off that you have and
it has pissed them off.

3472
02:47:40,701 --> 02:47:42,080
Piss them off.
Oh No.

3473
02:47:42,081 --> 02:47:47,081
They started like the argument and Piss 
people off by calling him a fucking a 

3474
02:47:47,081 --> 02:47:48,110
nanny.
You stupid ninny no.

3475
02:47:48,111 --> 02:47:53,111
Oh God.
There was one guy I called a chump and 

3476
02:47:53,111 --> 02:47:53,111
he was like,
you wouldn't say that to my face.

3477
02:47:53,111 --> 02:47:53,750

3479
02:47:57,171 --> 02:48:02,171

You need to call them out on twitter 

3480
02:48:02,171 --> 02:48:02,171
here.
No,

3481
02:48:02,171 --> 02:48:03,440
well I don't remember it anyway,
but he chose a.

3482
02:48:03,690 --> 02:48:05,480
it's really kind of innocuous,
right?

3483
02:48:05,550 --> 02:48:06,840
Yeah.
Call me a chomp.

3484
02:48:06,860 --> 02:48:07,580
I'd be like,

3485
02:48:07,581 --> 02:48:10,730
I'll let you have that.
We'll just end this right?

3486
02:48:11,450 --> 02:48:12,530
Oh yeah,
you fucking pussy.

3487
02:48:12,550 --> 02:48:13,480
Oh Hey.
You're a chump.

3488
02:48:13,830 --> 02:48:14,480
Alright,
we're good.

3489
02:48:14,630 --> 02:48:19,630
We'll just leave it alone.
Shop if you're happy with chop all this 

3490
02:48:19,630 --> 02:48:23,771
lady.
It's like you're not calling like a 

3491
02:48:23,771 --> 02:48:23,771
mentally bereft muppet or you know,
some kind of just like,

3492
02:48:23,780 --> 02:48:28,780
we'll see.
You like to get verbose with fucking 

3493
02:48:28,780 --> 02:48:28,780
self.
You like to go deep with your education.

3494
02:48:29,030 --> 02:48:30,020
I have,
I have.

3495
02:48:30,380 --> 02:48:31,790
I understand.
Decent vocabulary.

3496
02:48:31,800 --> 02:48:33,590
You're fucking paleontologists.
I get it.

3497
02:48:33,630 --> 02:48:35,390
Yeah.
Use what you got.

3498
02:48:35,391 --> 02:48:35,960
Right?
Right.

3499
02:48:36,290 --> 02:48:41,290
Yeah.
See some dudes just chomp is where they 

3500
02:48:41,290 --> 02:48:44,560
draw the line that he got mad and then 
he tried to go.

3501
02:48:44,590 --> 02:48:45,230
It's like,
oh no.

3502
02:48:45,231 --> 02:48:46,790
I was laughing at.
I know you work,

3503
02:48:46,791 --> 02:48:47,900
dude.
You're moving the goalpost.

3504
02:48:47,901 --> 02:48:50,270
Come on,
and some people do get really upset.

3505
02:48:50,271 --> 02:48:53,940
It just really innocuous words.
Yeah.

3506
02:48:54,940 --> 02:48:58,010
Choose have words.
They choose where they decide,

3507
02:48:58,400 --> 02:49:00,770
but none of them ever stick on white 
people.

3508
02:49:00,771 --> 02:49:05,771
That's the amazing thing.
There's never been a single racial slur 

3509
02:49:05,771 --> 02:49:07,550
that stuck on white people.
Yeah.

3510
02:49:07,640 --> 02:49:08,100
Their house.

3511
02:49:08,160 --> 02:49:10,620
One name,
one name one.

3512
02:49:10,621 --> 02:49:13,290
What can you call us?
A company.

3513
02:49:13,350 --> 02:49:18,350
It can't fucking even hate saying them,
but there's been a Hemi with it slur 

3514
02:49:20,341 --> 02:49:22,200
against Jewish people.
No white people.

3515
02:49:22,201 --> 02:49:24,390
Not Jews.
Tattoos and specific,

3516
02:49:24,780 --> 02:49:29,070
but that's still quite sort of a white 
Anglo Saxon.

3517
02:49:29,071 --> 02:49:31,170
Protestants.
WASPS.

3518
02:49:31,200 --> 02:49:36,200
That doesn't hurt anybody.
The bitches laugh while they're using 

3519
02:49:36,200 --> 02:49:36,280
their credit card,
but it didn't.

3520
02:49:36,380 --> 02:49:37,520
Ha.
That was.

3521
02:49:37,550 --> 02:49:42,240
That was a slur back in the day back 
before people could read and realize how

3522
02:49:42,241 --> 02:49:44,280
stupid it was.
Spain.

3523
02:49:44,430 --> 02:49:45,090
Shit,
dude,

3524
02:49:45,091 --> 02:49:46,590
that doesn't hurt nobody.
You can't.

3525
02:49:46,591 --> 02:49:51,591
You can't come up with on.
Well One's one that is sticking right 

3526
02:49:51,591 --> 02:49:51,591
now and I'm Kinda glad it does.
Is White privilege.

3527
02:49:51,930 --> 02:49:53,390
That doesn't stick.
Fuck yeah,

3528
02:49:53,430 --> 02:49:57,630
that's that stick and harsh.
And I told her the wrong crowd,

3529
02:49:58,030 --> 02:50:03,030
trevor.
I'm hanging out with smart fucking 

3530
02:50:03,030 --> 02:50:03,030
people,
man,

3531
02:50:03,030 --> 02:50:05,310
because if white privilege hurt them,
if you say that the EU,

3532
02:50:05,610 --> 02:50:05,820
how?

3533
02:50:05,900 --> 02:50:06,240
No,
no,

3534
02:50:06,570 --> 02:50:08,010
no.
Those are not people I hang out with.

3535
02:50:08,011 --> 02:50:08,890
Oh fuck no,
no.

3536
02:50:08,930 --> 02:50:11,310
I've been watching the reaction of 
people.

3537
02:50:11,560 --> 02:50:12,150
It's like,
yeah,

3538
02:50:12,151 --> 02:50:17,151
I'm sorry.
White privilege is totally fucking 

3539
02:50:17,151 --> 02:50:17,151
thing.
It's absolutely a thing.

3540
02:50:17,151 --> 02:50:22,100
It is documented is proven.
There's institutional racism is a 

3541
02:50:22,100 --> 02:50:24,060
hundred percent fucking fact.
Well,

3542
02:50:24,061 --> 02:50:29,061
what white privilege is,
is sort of the lack of racism against 

3543
02:50:29,061 --> 02:50:31,440
white people and in highlights racism 
against other people.

3544
02:50:31,650 --> 02:50:36,650
So what white privilege really is,
is how everybody should sort of be 

3545
02:50:36,650 --> 02:50:37,500
treated.
Everybody should be treated like they're

3546
02:50:37,501 --> 02:50:40,230
not a criminal waiting to be discovered 
exactly right,

3547
02:50:40,350 --> 02:50:42,630
but that's not really a privilege for 
white people.

3548
02:50:42,631 --> 02:50:46,080
What it does is it highlights that 
there's racism against people who aren't

3549
02:50:46,081 --> 02:50:51,081
white,
so like to say that white people are 

3550
02:50:51,081 --> 02:50:53,481
somehow our fault because there's a 
racist biased against people who are 

3551
02:50:53,821 --> 02:50:57,090
brown or black or Asian or or what have 
you.

3552
02:50:57,420 --> 02:51:01,920
It really kind of shifts the blame and a
kind of a weird way in my opinion.

3553
02:51:02,160 --> 02:51:04,770
I mean I think it's a real thing for 
sure,

3554
02:51:04,920 --> 02:51:09,920
but I think really what we should 
concentrate on instead of concentrating 

3555
02:51:09,920 --> 02:51:12,891
on getting white people to Kowtow and,
and to bow down to the fact that they 

3556
02:51:12,891 --> 02:51:17,040
have privilege to just eliminate racism 
from the world,

3557
02:51:17,041 --> 02:51:21,060
which I think is an entirely a possible 
thing in our lifetime.

3558
02:51:21,120 --> 02:51:26,120
It's totally possible.
But the problem with that is we have to 

3559
02:51:26,120 --> 02:51:29,481
come to terms with being privileged.
We have to come to terms with we the 

3560
02:51:29,650 --> 02:51:30,450
terms.
Yeah.

3561
02:51:30,451 --> 02:51:31,410
We have to.
You know,

3562
02:51:31,411 --> 02:51:34,860
people have to understand that yes,
because you are white,

3563
02:51:35,070 --> 02:51:36,900
you are privileged because you are 
white.

3564
02:51:37,110 --> 02:51:39,750
You will not get pulled over as much.
You will not get shot as much.

3565
02:51:39,751 --> 02:51:42,210
We have to come to terms with that and 
in what way?

3566
02:51:42,270 --> 02:51:45,540
Because we're the ones doing the 
institutional racism.

3567
02:51:45,600 --> 02:51:47,550
We not.
We were not doing.

3568
02:51:47,910 --> 02:51:51,310
Not when someone is someone.
Yes,

3569
02:51:52,020 --> 02:51:53,640
but who are these people that are doing 
that?

3570
02:51:53,970 --> 02:51:55,500
Right?
Police officers,

3571
02:51:55,501 --> 02:51:56,300
yes.
Right.

3572
02:51:56,490 --> 02:51:58,280
Sure.
Police officers,

3573
02:51:58,290 --> 02:52:03,290
politicians.
We have an issue with police officers 

3574
02:52:03,290 --> 02:52:05,241
first of all because I don't think.
I think there's almost no one who is 

3575
02:52:05,241 --> 02:52:09,061
qualified to be a police officer.
I think it's an insanely difficult job 

3576
02:52:09,061 --> 02:52:11,680
that we just assume people can handle 
and I think it's a chaotic,

3577
02:52:11,681 --> 02:52:15,430
ridiculous amount of pressure that these
people have to endure on a daily basis.

3578
02:52:15,700 --> 02:52:20,700
They're pulling people over.
They have no idea they're going to be 

3579
02:52:20,700 --> 02:52:20,700
shot.
They see death every day.

3580
02:52:20,700 --> 02:52:24,700
You see people getting shot and 
accidents and murders and domestic 

3581
02:52:24,700 --> 02:52:28,471
violence and chaos and I don't think 
people are psychologically able to 

3582
02:52:28,471 --> 02:52:29,140
handle that.
I think we think of it as a job.

3583
02:52:29,140 --> 02:52:30,160
Every few,
absolutely.

3584
02:52:30,161 --> 02:52:35,161
Very few.
We think of it as a job the same way we 

3585
02:52:35,161 --> 02:52:35,800
think of camera repair and you know 
someone who builds cars.

3586
02:52:36,010 --> 02:52:37,870
It is not.
It's not a job.

3587
02:52:37,871 --> 02:52:42,871
It's an incredibly difficult 
psychological endeavor to try to take on

3588
02:52:43,541 --> 02:52:48,541
the task of being the voice of the law 
or the arm of the law and to go out and 

3589
02:52:49,581 --> 02:52:54,581
to treat people with respect and dignity
and and not be terrified at every 

3590
02:52:54,581 --> 02:52:55,000
fucking traffic stop.
That's,

3591
02:52:55,030 --> 02:53:00,030
that's a big problem.
A big problem is also the problem with 

3592
02:53:00,190 --> 02:53:05,190
the communities that we've allowed these
terribly disenfranchised in impoverished

3593
02:53:05,681 --> 02:53:10,681
communities to stay exactly the way they
are without pumping federal funds into 

3594
02:53:10,681 --> 02:53:14,971
them without trying to clean them up 
well without trying to figure out a way 

3595
02:53:14,971 --> 02:53:18,001
to elevate people in these areas.
We want them to pull themselves up by 

3596
02:53:18,001 --> 02:53:18,880
their bootstraps and without doing it 
with gentrification,

3597
02:53:18,881 --> 02:53:22,150
without going in there because hey,
that's where the rent is currently cheap

3598
02:53:22,330 --> 02:53:25,030
and taking over those areas and forcing 
out lower rent.

3599
02:53:25,030 --> 02:53:28,700
Families that can't make enough money is
like the housing.

3600
02:53:28,760 --> 02:53:31,540
That's like a sneaky thing that people 
do like do,

3601
02:53:32,290 --> 02:53:33,400
do it,
but not all.

3602
02:53:33,460 --> 02:53:38,460
Not all just real estate people do it,
people do it like looking for apartment 

3603
02:53:38,460 --> 02:53:39,240
buildings and all that.
It's like it's,

3604
02:53:39,610 --> 02:53:44,610
it's.
That's a very real thing and if more 

3605
02:53:44,610 --> 02:53:45,130
people with more money move into an 
area,

3606
02:53:45,460 --> 02:53:50,460
rents go higher,
it's this fucking statistical and then 

3607
02:53:50,460 --> 02:53:54,871
those people that are on assisted 
funding or people that have limited 

3608
02:53:55,751 --> 02:53:57,490
access to funds because of jobs and all 
that,

3609
02:53:57,730 --> 02:54:02,730
they get pushed out of those areas and 
they create concentrated areas of very 

3610
02:54:04,001 --> 02:54:07,780
low middle class to low class poverty,
food deserts,

3611
02:54:07,781 --> 02:54:12,781
horrible fucking places and everybody 
just turns a fucking blind eye to it.

3612
02:54:13,010 --> 02:54:15,200
Well,
people are busy with their own lives.

3613
02:54:15,260 --> 02:54:20,260
That's really what it is.
Most people don't have the resources or 

3614
02:54:20,260 --> 02:54:24,461
the wherewithal to do anything to have 
an impact on these impoverished 

3615
02:54:24,461 --> 02:54:24,920
communities and they have their own 
credit card debt.

3616
02:54:25,040 --> 02:54:30,040
That's fine,
but they can at least understand that 

3617
02:54:30,040 --> 02:54:32,660
that is going on that okay,
you understand and I understand that,

3618
02:54:32,661 --> 02:54:37,360
but how is that helping those people?
That's a very good question.

3619
02:54:38,020 --> 02:54:40,570
Give me a second so I don't sound like a
ranting idiot.

3620
02:54:41,230 --> 02:54:42,520
We understand.
First of all,

3621
02:54:42,521 --> 02:54:46,480
congratulations for taking a pause 
because most people don't.

3622
02:54:46,840 --> 02:54:50,430
Most people,
they just keep plowing through.

3623
02:54:50,450 --> 02:54:51,040
They'll go,
well,

3624
02:54:51,080 --> 02:54:55,540
it was thinking about this shitting 
shitting on Eric Dubay that that's just.

3625
02:54:55,660 --> 02:54:58,250
I know you're still angry.
I controlled you.

3626
02:54:58,480 --> 02:54:59,890
Totally,
totally.

3627
02:55:00,400 --> 02:55:03,950
I will get my revenge.
I knew this podcast.

3628
02:55:03,951 --> 02:55:04,020
Oh

3629
02:55:04,020 --> 02:55:09,020
my guy that's in my back pocket.
I'm going to have to break out that 

3630
02:55:09,020 --> 02:55:11,830
video at one point in time on to watch 
him watch you get fucking beat red and 

3631
02:55:11,930 --> 02:55:16,370
we know that is true.
Is it affecting us?

3632
02:55:16,610 --> 02:55:21,610
Possibly.
Can it affect the human race as a whole 

3633
02:55:21,610 --> 02:55:21,610
hundred percent?
Yes.

3634
02:55:22,280 --> 02:55:25,850
Because of that.
Because of the reach you have,

3635
02:55:25,910 --> 02:55:30,910
I don't nearly have the reach you have,
but because of the reach you have and 

3636
02:55:30,910 --> 02:55:31,730
you have that reach right now,
I have that absolutely right now,

3637
02:55:31,731 --> 02:55:33,440
but this is like what?
Twice in two years.

3638
02:55:33,441 --> 02:55:36,170
Come on.
You do this fucking five times a week,

3639
02:55:36,200 --> 02:55:41,200
but the numbers that this podcast are 
reaching comparison to the numbers have 

3640
02:55:41,200 --> 02:55:41,200
reached two years ago.
Dude,

3641
02:55:41,200 --> 02:55:42,200
you gonna hit millions of people right 
now.

3642
02:55:42,260 --> 02:55:43,730
Well then that's great what you're 
saying.

3643
02:55:43,760 --> 02:55:47,240
Well then what they need to do is they 
need to understand and yeah,

3644
02:55:47,300 --> 02:55:48,140
this isn't like,
you know,

3645
02:55:48,141 --> 02:55:50,390
a send money to Africa thing and all 
that.

3646
02:55:50,420 --> 02:55:52,010
Yes,
there's horrible poverty,

3647
02:55:52,011 --> 02:55:57,011
poverty in the world.
There's horrible food shortages in the 

3648
02:55:57,011 --> 02:55:58,310
world and all of that,
but you also have to think about what is

3649
02:55:58,311 --> 02:56:00,650
happening specifically in your 
community.

3650
02:56:00,920 --> 02:56:03,320
We are one species.
We are Homo Sapiens,

3651
02:56:03,321 --> 02:56:08,321
sapiens.
It's our job because we are affecting 

3652
02:56:08,321 --> 02:56:10,100
the planet to also fix because we live 
here.

3653
02:56:10,370 --> 02:56:13,670
This is our current home.
This is the only one we have.

3654
02:56:13,671 --> 02:56:15,980
We have overpopulation problem.
We have food problems.

3655
02:56:16,000 --> 02:56:18,800
All of that.
Start small.

3656
02:56:18,920 --> 02:56:23,570
Fix Your fucking community by simply 
saying hi to your neighbor.

3657
02:56:25,190 --> 02:56:30,190
If somebody is saying,
if you're in a crowded apartment 

3658
02:56:30,190 --> 02:56:31,290
building and you know you have a person 
like struggling with,

3659
02:56:31,670 --> 02:56:36,670
with groceries,
why not offer to fucking help because 

3660
02:56:36,670 --> 02:56:37,280
then it takes get a word.
You're to rape her.

3661
02:56:37,700 --> 02:56:39,470
No,
you got to follow her into her apartment

3662
02:56:39,471 --> 02:56:44,471
and just to put them in the fucking 
elevator and the put them out the of 

3663
02:56:44,471 --> 02:56:45,320
something simple as that would be nice.

3664
02:56:45,320 --> 02:56:47,390
Yeah.
I have an idea how about people actually

3665
02:56:47,391 --> 02:56:52,391
bought or bother to merge correctly on 
freeways or to not,

3666
02:56:53,030 --> 02:56:55,280
you know,
not cut people off at the last second,

3667
02:56:55,520 --> 02:57:00,520
think about what your actions are doing.
Think cognitively on what that is 

3668
02:57:01,161 --> 02:57:02,900
happening,
what's causing that?

3669
02:57:03,230 --> 02:57:07,220
All of you motherfuckers that cut in at 
the last time to get around traffic,

3670
02:57:07,370 --> 02:57:09,800
guess what?
You're causing the fucking traffic.

3671
02:57:10,400 --> 02:57:14,090
This is simple physics.
I don't think this is going to help poor

3672
02:57:14,091 --> 02:57:15,320
people,
but no,

3673
02:57:15,670 --> 02:57:17,120
but it's not,
but it's not on Jamie.

3674
02:57:17,370 --> 02:57:22,370
There's actually an article just came 
out this week that says that that helps 

3675
02:57:22,370 --> 02:57:22,370
traffic.
I don't know if it's.

3676
02:57:22,370 --> 02:57:27,290
It's probably a scientific study,
but people cutting people off helps 

3677
02:57:27,290 --> 02:57:30,161
track cutting people off,
but the people that merging the last 

3678
02:57:30,161 --> 02:57:30,161
second,
last,

3679
02:57:30,161 --> 02:57:30,161
second,
mergers improve traffic.

3680
02:57:30,161 --> 02:57:34,540
How is that possible?
Because everyone thinks if mother 

3681
02:57:34,540 --> 02:57:34,540
fuckers science,
it's impossible.

3682
02:57:34,540 --> 02:57:37,220
Everything backs up behind them.
You not.

3683
02:57:37,360 --> 02:57:39,200
If they're good,
they know what they're doing.

3684
02:57:39,260 --> 02:57:44,260
If they're a good band,
they got a little Miada or something 

3685
02:57:44,260 --> 02:57:44,560
like that.
My challenge is 16 feet long car.

3686
02:57:44,790 --> 02:57:47,660
I love those cars right out there.
It was a fun trade,

3687
02:57:47,661 --> 02:57:50,780
you know,
need to know anyway,

3688
02:57:51,140 --> 02:57:56,030
but helping them sort of why I'm helping
in your community as simple.

3689
02:57:56,031 --> 02:57:58,610
So like the place I work right now,
the faculty,

3690
02:57:59,310 --> 02:58:02,010
we're a neighborhood bar.
We're nice to

3691
02:58:02,010 --> 02:58:07,010
people in the neighborhood we make.
We make deals with the local business 

3692
02:58:07,010 --> 02:58:07,010
owners.
We talk about the neighborhood.

3693
02:58:07,010 --> 02:58:10,200
We try and drive crime out.
We try and do all that kind of thing.

3694
02:58:10,470 --> 02:58:14,250
My owner owns two shops on that block.
We're trying to revitalize the blog.

3695
02:58:14,251 --> 02:58:19,251
We're not trying to gentrify it.
We're not trying to like bring in the 

3696
02:58:19,251 --> 02:58:19,251
hipsters from fucking silver lake and 
all that bullshit.

3697
02:58:19,251 --> 02:58:21,060
Why it was wrong with the hipsters.
I don't get me started,

3698
02:58:21,270 --> 02:58:26,270
but they look like you.
They have like yellow beards and wear 

3699
02:58:26,270 --> 02:58:26,760
weird clothes,
you know?

3700
02:58:26,940 --> 02:58:29,580
No tattoos.
I don't have skinny jeans.

3701
02:58:29,581 --> 02:58:30,090
Dude.
Come on.

3702
02:58:30,091 --> 02:58:31,140
Look at me.
You're a big fella.

3703
02:58:31,200 --> 02:58:33,690
I'm a big fellow fellow.
You might not have skinny jeans.

3704
02:58:33,691 --> 02:58:34,830
I wouldn't.
I wouldn't do that.

3705
02:58:34,980 --> 02:58:36,870
I'm not doing that.
What's wrong with the hipsters?

3706
02:58:36,900 --> 02:58:37,910
I just,
I be.

3707
02:58:37,930 --> 02:58:38,970
It's,
it's the.

3708
02:58:38,971 --> 02:58:40,940
It's the pomposity of hipsters that 
bothered me.

3709
02:58:41,030 --> 02:58:44,910
The word I love that you used pomposity 
not all hipsters.

3710
02:58:44,940 --> 02:58:46,050
Hashtag,
not all hipsters.

3711
02:58:46,620 --> 02:58:49,530
Um,
Hashtag.

3712
02:58:49,531 --> 02:58:50,220
Yes.
All women.

3713
02:58:50,221 --> 02:58:55,221
Hashtag not all hipsters.
There are a select few that are the 

3714
02:58:55,521 --> 02:58:57,720
stereotypical hipster of like,
Eh,

3715
02:58:57,840 --> 02:58:58,530
you know,
it's like,

3716
02:58:58,531 --> 02:58:59,170
oh,
you know,

3717
02:58:59,190 --> 02:59:01,320
I liked them before.
They were cool and shit like that.

3718
02:59:01,380 --> 02:59:06,380
Yeah.
They have vinyl and we listen to vinyl 

3719
02:59:06,380 --> 02:59:08,511
in my car.
Fucking record player in their Prius 

3720
02:59:08,530 --> 02:59:08,760
con.

3721
02:59:12,960 --> 02:59:17,050
Oh Wow.
That's a stupid fucking imagery.

3722
02:59:17,910 --> 02:59:21,900
How you know it's happened over.
There was a record player that they came

3723
02:59:21,901 --> 02:59:26,901
up with for cars in the 19 fifties,
I want to say that was EPA for speed.

3724
02:59:27,130 --> 02:59:28,770
Bumps were invented.
Now man.

3725
02:59:28,771 --> 02:59:32,610
I mean it didn't work,
but there was a record player for cars I

3726
02:59:32,611 --> 02:59:37,380
long fucking time ago.
I'm trying to remember.

3727
02:59:37,410 --> 02:59:38,130
Oh,
there it is.

3728
02:59:38,620 --> 02:59:41,580
Look at this.
Chrysler did eventually add an option to

3729
02:59:41,581 --> 02:59:46,320
play 45 rpm records on the high way high
five.

3730
02:59:46,590 --> 02:59:48,930
But perhaps that choice came too late in
1960.

3731
02:59:48,931 --> 02:59:53,931
A much cheaper car record player was 
offered as a Chrysler option to come on 

3732
02:59:53,931 --> 02:59:57,750
the market.
The RCA Victor Auto Victrola,

3733
02:59:57,960 --> 03:00:02,520
it costs $51.
It'd be $410 today and you can play your

3734
03:00:02,521 --> 03:00:04,410
own 40 fives on it.
Way to go.

3735
03:00:04,411 --> 03:00:06,640
Mopar,
Mopar,

3736
03:00:06,700 --> 03:00:07,800
yeah.
That's fucking.

3737
03:00:08,250 --> 03:00:10,170
Look at this thing.
That's awesome.

3738
03:00:10,170 --> 03:00:12,280
This is pretty fucking dope.
But you know,

3739
03:00:12,300 --> 03:00:17,300
obviously you got to drive real slow and
hit no bumps and father got super 

3740
03:00:17,300 --> 03:00:18,690
annoying.
But look how it works man.

3741
03:00:18,691 --> 03:00:21,390
It's crazy.
That's bad ass.

3742
03:00:22,600 --> 03:00:26,940
You pick up the record player,
you slide it in there and it literally.

3743
03:00:27,830 --> 03:00:30,900
That's a stack.
It's an early CD changer.

3744
03:00:30,950 --> 03:00:32,590
Yeah.
He's got like,

3745
03:00:32,610 --> 03:00:34,830
that's what they used to do.
People don't remember that,

3746
03:00:34,831 --> 03:00:35,610
but yeah,
no,

3747
03:00:35,640 --> 03:00:40,640
the needles used to lift up and they 
would take the next record and drop it 

3748
03:00:40,640 --> 03:00:42,240
down and play the next one.
That was so cool back then.

3749
03:00:42,660 --> 03:00:44,760
We'd stack a bunch of records on top of 
each other.

3750
03:00:44,970 --> 03:00:47,760
Better what it read off that if it's 
reading the bottom,

3751
03:00:48,380 --> 03:00:49,080
the weight,
right?

3752
03:00:49,410 --> 03:00:50,220
Oh Hey.
Yeah.

3753
03:00:50,221 --> 03:00:51,710
Good idea.
And if there's any kind,

3754
03:00:51,750 --> 03:00:56,750
any kind of shock absorption there that 
we'll and see if we can hear anything 

3755
03:00:57,160 --> 03:00:58,300
that still does.
Now

3756
03:01:01,690 --> 03:01:03,130
61,
desoto,

3757
03:01:03,190 --> 03:01:08,190
that song makes you want to kill myself.
Some of that old music that reminds me 

3758
03:01:08,190 --> 03:01:09,610
of like grandma's house like right 
before she died.

3759
03:01:10,070 --> 03:01:10,840
I'm like,
oh,

3760
03:01:11,080 --> 03:01:13,870
it's depressing in here.
And on that note,

3761
03:01:14,770 --> 03:01:16,540
let's wrap this bitch up and bring it 
home,

3762
03:01:16,541 --> 03:01:21,541
trevor.
Thank you brothers really more often 

3763
03:01:21,541 --> 03:01:22,310
than every two years.
Absolutely.

3764
03:01:22,320 --> 03:01:24,310
It's like all those text messages back 
and forth.

3765
03:01:24,311 --> 03:01:26,590
If we could do this all the time that we
can do this.

3766
03:01:26,620 --> 03:01:27,370
Dude,
I'm local.

3767
03:01:27,430 --> 03:01:29,230
Your local.
We can make this happen.

3768
03:01:29,231 --> 03:01:34,231
Yeah.
And next time when you're at the place 

3769
03:01:34,231 --> 03:01:34,231
across the street from where I am.
Come the fuck over.

3770
03:01:34,231 --> 03:01:34,231
Oh yeah,
that's right.

3771
03:01:34,231 --> 03:01:36,040
That was at the Baja cafe and I was a 
Tiki.

3772
03:01:36,041 --> 03:01:41,041
Know what's Tiki?
Tiki knows a bad ass Tiki bar in north 

3773
03:01:41,041 --> 03:01:42,090
Hollywood right there on like a lot of 
bars fellow,

3774
03:01:42,110 --> 03:01:43,450
Huh?
Kind of a boozer.

3775
03:01:43,451 --> 03:01:45,850
A little bit and a little bit 
functional.

3776
03:01:45,851 --> 03:01:46,810
Alcoholic.
Cheers.

3777
03:01:47,020 --> 03:01:48,040
Cheers.
Cheers on that.

3778
03:01:48,070 --> 03:01:52,030
Thank you again.
And Tattoos and bones on twitter,

3779
03:01:52,031 --> 03:01:56,200
if you want to yell at them for being a 
flat earth shell or round Earth Shell,

3780
03:01:56,201 --> 03:01:58,570
rather,
people are already doing it.

3781
03:01:58,571 --> 03:02:00,490
They're like,
you should call him out on his fatness.

3782
03:02:00,491 --> 03:02:02,330
He's not healthy.
Stuff like that.

3783
03:02:02,331 --> 03:02:05,470
I don't read that out loud for sure.
Are you feeding the trolls?

3784
03:02:05,500 --> 03:02:06,550
Oh yeah,
they have data.

3785
03:02:06,700 --> 03:02:07,690
Hey,
nick steroid,

3786
03:02:07,691 --> 03:02:09,220
David Jennings.
Fuck you.

3787
03:02:09,280 --> 03:02:10,660
All Right,

3788
03:02:10,990 --> 03:02:12,970

trussell.

3789
03:02:12,971 --> 03:02:13,420
See it.
