00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,910
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:03,983
I find,

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:04,531
you know,

4
00:00:04,531 --> 00:00:05,041
like I said,

5
00:00:05,041 --> 00:00:07,650
vandelay probably one of my all time
favorite guys to watch because you see it

6
00:00:07,651 --> 00:00:08,670
was pure chaos,

7
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,120
but I find that people like yourself
oftentimes make really good analysts

8
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,690
because like you were a guy who
is like looking at fighting,

9
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:20,010
whether it's mma,

10
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,450
stand up on the ground,

11
00:00:21,451 --> 00:00:22,284
whatever it was,

12
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:26,370
you're looking at it at
this very analytical level.

13
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,610
It's for me it's like asking questions.

14
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,310
That's one of my boxing coaches.

15
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,250
Kenny welding used to say that when I
thought Aaron the second time he watched

16
00:00:35,251 --> 00:00:37,270
the fight after the fact and he was like,

17
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:38,220
was like,

18
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:38,961
so what do you think?

19
00:00:38,961 --> 00:00:39,794
And he goes,

20
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:40,350
good.

21
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:41,670
It has a lot of questions.

22
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:42,451
Is like,

23
00:00:42,451 --> 00:00:42,871
what do you mean?

24
00:00:42,871 --> 00:00:43,760
He has a lot of questions.

25
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:44,310
He's like,

26
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:48,410
every time you do something you're asking
them a question and then I'm sorry,

27
00:00:48,411 --> 00:00:49,350
every time he does something,

28
00:00:49,351 --> 00:00:52,140
he's asking you a question and
you're answering him with like,

29
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,110
I'm going to do this and what are
you going to do about what I'm doing?

30
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,300
And he's just asking me
why are you doing that?

31
00:00:57,301 --> 00:00:58,200
Why are you doing that?

32
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:58,860
So he's like,

33
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,840
he's saying he's asking all the questions,

34
00:01:00,841 --> 00:01:02,190
but he has no answers.

35
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:04,050
So he's asking me questions.

36
00:01:04,051 --> 00:01:06,090
I'm giving him matches and um,

37
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:09,210
I think that's Kinda how I watched fight.

38
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:10,053
So how I fought,

39
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,750
I would try to do something and see
what you're doing because of that.

40
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,240
You kind of play with that and feel it.

41
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:15,600
And,

42
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,370
and that's how I watch
other people fly to watch.

43
00:01:17,371 --> 00:01:18,390
When I watch guys fight,

44
00:01:18,391 --> 00:01:18,691
I'm like,

45
00:01:18,691 --> 00:01:19,411
what is he doing?

46
00:01:19,411 --> 00:01:20,360
Why is he doing that?

47
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:21,720
Is he trying to set something up?

48
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:22,930
Is this guy going to react?

49
00:01:22,931 --> 00:01:24,300
How is that guy going to react to that?

50
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:25,710
What's he going to do about him?

51
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:28,170
What's he going to do about his strengths?

52
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:29,880
He knows he's coming in
with these strengths.

53
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:31,710
So how is he going to try
and take those things away?

54
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:32,160
Well,

55
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,220
he just going to try to
impose his own strengths.

56
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:35,103
I,

57
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:35,851
for me,

58
00:01:35,851 --> 00:01:37,200
that's what fighting is.

59
00:01:37,201 --> 00:01:42,201
It's be making yourself as comfortable
as you can be at all times while making

60
00:01:43,021 --> 00:01:45,000
the other guy as
uncomfortable as he can be.

61
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:46,321
For me,

62
00:01:46,321 --> 00:01:47,000
that's what I,

63
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,640
I tried to look at and I tried
to see if guys play like that,

64
00:01:50,641 --> 00:01:50,970
how the,

65
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:52,320
how are they going to play that game?

66
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:54,020
Yeah.

67
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:59,020
That completely makes sense that you had
that kind of style with that approach.

68
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:00,660
You know,

69
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:04,980
I just always admired the
way you would set things up.

70
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,680
You always had a real technical style,

71
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:08,521
which I mean,

72
00:02:08,521 --> 00:02:09,060
like I said,

73
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,410
I admire chaos to admire those
Melvin manhoef dudes too.

74
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:13,140
You know,

75
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,880
I admire vandelay like maybe more than
anybody just because it was so wild to

76
00:02:17,881 --> 00:02:18,714
watch.

77
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:19,711
But um,

78
00:02:19,711 --> 00:02:20,100
I find,

79
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:23,710
I find that for analysis like Dominick
Cruz is another guy I think knocks it out

80
00:02:23,711 --> 00:02:25,800
of park because he's so,

81
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:31,040
so smart and his assessment of risk
and reward and putting yourself in a

82
00:02:31,771 --> 00:02:35,040
position where your opponent doesn't
exactly know what you're going to do,

83
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:37,420
but you know how he's
gonna react because you're,

84
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,400
you have this awkward style that you've
seen other people react to for a long

85
00:02:41,401 --> 00:02:42,180
time.

86
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,550
But for them it's like this new thing.

87
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:48,060
They're standing in front of this guy
who's switching stances and bouncing and

88
00:02:48,061 --> 00:02:50,010
moving up and down and back and forth,

89
00:02:50,011 --> 00:02:53,070
and you're not exactly sure
what the fuck he's doing,

90
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,820
but he knows what you're
going to do because he's so
used to doing it to regular

91
00:02:56,821 --> 00:02:57,241
people,

92
00:02:57,241 --> 00:02:59,040
like everybody who stands like you,

93
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:02,730
like certain guys that you have that
like more Thai style and God there.

94
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:07,570
There's so much that they're giving a
guy in that situation and when you got a

95
00:03:07,571 --> 00:03:09,100
guy like dominick Cruz,

96
00:03:09,101 --> 00:03:11,290
like he's not predictable at all.

97
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,030
He's like flipping stances and moving
around and throwing punches from these

98
00:03:16,031 --> 00:03:19,840
weird fucking angles where you
would swear he's doing it wrong.

99
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:20,560
Right?

100
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,060
Yeah.

101
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,570
It's for me,

102
00:03:22,571 --> 00:03:26,470
I always look at the way someone explained
something to me is the easiest way to

103
00:03:26,471 --> 00:03:27,304
explain it.

104
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:28,930
And Ben asked Grin.

105
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,793
Tyron said,

106
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,570
Ben Likes to cause scrambles,

107
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:32,530
right?

108
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:33,550
That's what dom does.

109
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,400
He's causing scrambles
on the feet because he's.

110
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:38,380
He's not in the traditional position.

111
00:03:38,381 --> 00:03:38,900
He's not in.

112
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,200
He's not coming at you
like everybody else does.

113
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,860
So what he's doing is initiating
and scrambled right away.

114
00:03:44,861 --> 00:03:45,290
When you're.

115
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:48,880
When you get a guy on top of you like
Rda and he's good at establishing

116
00:03:48,881 --> 00:03:49,714
position,

117
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,400
if you can create a scramble,

118
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:54,220
then you have a better chance
of getting out than if you,

119
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,830
than if you just try
to use basic technique.

120
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:59,230
And Dominic is comfortable
in those scrambles.

121
00:03:59,231 --> 00:03:59,830
He,

122
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:01,570
he's been in them so many times.

123
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,780
When you react you have like
three or four reactions.

124
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:06,250
But he has like 22.

125
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,473
Wow.

126
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:08,650
Damn.

127
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:08,861
You know,

128
00:04:08,861 --> 00:04:10,000
he did a great breakdown.

129
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,420
A cure from the underground cure genesis.

130
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,050
Yeah.

131
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:14,740
He uh,

132
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:17,050
see if he could find
that he put it up today.

133
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:18,931
He put up a,

134
00:04:18,931 --> 00:04:19,170
a,

135
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:24,170
an article breaking down all the
variables of dominick Cruz's footwork.

136
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:29,650
Really interesting stuff because you
don't until you see it as a list,

137
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,750
like all the different things he does.

138
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,580
And kubrick did an awesome job of,

139
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:38,320
of just sort of a breaking down all the
different things in his fights and it

140
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:39,400
just makes you realize like,

141
00:04:39,401 --> 00:04:39,731
wow,

142
00:04:39,731 --> 00:04:43,090
that guy's got a lot of
options to like someone was,

143
00:04:43,091 --> 00:04:43,930
I think it was Ludwig,

144
00:04:43,931 --> 00:04:45,700
was saying that he doesn't
think he has good technique.

145
00:04:45,701 --> 00:04:47,170
And how can you say that though,

146
00:04:47,171 --> 00:04:48,790
because he lands so many punches,

147
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,050
like how can you say it?

148
00:04:50,051 --> 00:04:52,360
Like it might not look
like everybody else's.

149
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:53,730
But goddamn,

150
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:54,573
it's working.

151
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:55,250
I mean,

152
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:55,631
it works.

153
00:04:55,631 --> 00:04:57,340
It's crazy how effective it is.

154
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:57,671
See,

155
00:04:57,671 --> 00:04:58,740
this is all this stuff that,

156
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,490
that Kirk wrote down,

157
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,680
all the different stuff that dominic does.

158
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:05,861
Pretty interesting,

159
00:05:05,861 --> 00:05:06,694
right?

160
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:10,180
A neo footwork is what
people are calling it,

161
00:05:10,181 --> 00:05:11,014
right?

162
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,330
So like a Tj dillashaw style.

163
00:05:13,331 --> 00:05:15,010
He's got a very interesting style too.

164
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:16,330
And uh,

165
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:17,163
I uh,

166
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,370
I hit pads with Dwayne recently.

167
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,930
Dwayne showed me some stuff and one
of the things he's doing is all he's

168
00:05:21,931 --> 00:05:23,320
switched stances.

169
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,970
He's doing like these you're switching
and throwing punches as you're switching.

170
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,710
He's got a lot of this switch stance
stuff that he's rick really incorporating

171
00:05:32,711 --> 00:05:33,670
into these combinations.

172
00:05:33,671 --> 00:05:35,230
And you see it a lot from tj.

173
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,200
I mean Tj is as comfortable
from a south paws.

174
00:05:38,201 --> 00:05:42,430
He is from an Orthodox and he's
doing a lot of these switch moves.

175
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:42,760
Like they're,

176
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,540
they're hitting pads with these
and they're very confused,

177
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,143
you know.

178
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:51,160
So remember when I said
I don't like that style,

179
00:05:51,161 --> 00:05:55,360
that Geeky pseudo style
because not because,

180
00:05:55,361 --> 00:05:56,800
but dominic style,

181
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,510
that style I think is
the style to beat that.

182
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:04,280
The reason I say that is because
the way dominic is approaching it,

183
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:08,420
he's approaching it from a educated,

184
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,471
I would say,

185
00:06:09,471 --> 00:06:10,400
more educated,

186
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:13,040
more studious place.

187
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:18,500
These guys are approaching it from
trying to get you to buy the wolf ticket.

188
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:20,150
You know,

189
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:20,541
so they're.

190
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:25,040
They're giving you these weird looks
because that's gonna make you get off

191
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:25,431
balance,

192
00:06:25,431 --> 00:06:25,671
get.

193
00:06:25,671 --> 00:06:26,630
I'd stand there for them.

194
00:06:26,631 --> 00:06:28,220
Be The guy that's just a target.

195
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:32,270
But dom is giving you these looks
from a fighting perspective.

196
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,240
He's always in position
to fight those guys.

197
00:06:35,241 --> 00:06:35,631
When you're.

198
00:06:35,631 --> 00:06:36,520
When you're breakdancing,

199
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:38,090
sometimes you're not in position to react.

200
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:43,370
Dom is always imposition to react and
that's why I think that style is the style

201
00:06:43,371 --> 00:06:44,690
that beats the other style.

202
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,040
10 out of 10 times.

203
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:51,020
What's really interesting is I don't
recall anybody before dominick Cruz doing

204
00:06:51,021 --> 00:06:51,854
it like that.

205
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,320
A really don't it.

206
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:55,760
It's a lot of what.

207
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:56,121
I mean,

208
00:06:56,121 --> 00:06:56,811
it's limited,

209
00:06:56,811 --> 00:07:00,020
but Mohammed Ali did a lot of
things like that with his boxing,

210
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,333
you know,

211
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,160
the rope and open his
footwork that that's,

212
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,090
that's a part of it.

213
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,440
That's a part of what dom does.

214
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,180
Dom does it for MMA,

215
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,010
so he has to be aware of the kicks,

216
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,540
tie ups and clenches.

217
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:12,171
I mean,

218
00:07:12,171 --> 00:07:14,660
how many times do you see
guys press dom on the fence?

219
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:16,303
Almost never.

220
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,000
Never.

221
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,690
Very rarely.
