1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,330
The joe rogan experience,
it's going to take a lot of time to

2
00:00:03,331 --> 00:00:05,460
understand it.
Primarily because people don't really

3
00:00:05,461 --> 00:00:08,790
understand money as it is today.
They don't understand how banks work.

4
00:00:08,791 --> 00:00:11,670
They don't understand how the Federal
Reserve creates money.

5
00:00:11,671 --> 00:00:14,340
They don't understand a debt based
system for money.

6
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:15,960
I've read about it.
I don't understand it.

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,060
Well,
a read many things.

8
00:00:18,061 --> 00:00:21,060
I watch documentaries when I understand
that most of the people when the first

9
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,520
face bitcoin,
they start asking questions about money

10
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:26,880
and it quickly becomes apparent to all
of us when we do this,

11
00:00:26,881 --> 00:00:29,610
that we don't know much about money.
So when we learn about money and we

12
00:00:29,611 --> 00:00:31,890
start reading about money,
but um,

13
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:32,551
you know,
it's,

14
00:00:32,551 --> 00:00:35,730
it's very much part of the culture to
the point where I'll talk to people

15
00:00:35,731 --> 00:00:37,170
about bitcoin and they'll say,
well,

16
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:39,960
it's not backed by gold.
So how can it have value?

17
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,290
The dollar hasn't been backed by gold
for like 60 years.

18
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,610
And you talk to the average person in
the streets and they still think there's

19
00:00:47,611 --> 00:00:50,460
some gold in a volt and that stuff does,
it doesn't exist.

20
00:00:50,461 --> 00:00:52,800
I'm happening all the gold in the vault
watches.

21
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,750
Well,
that's a whole other question.

22
00:00:54,751 --> 00:00:59,280
I mean the real issue is this heath,
we haven't been on a gold standard for

23
00:00:59,281 --> 00:01:03,840
decades and all of the currencies in the
world are created based on the

24
00:01:03,841 --> 00:01:06,180
productive capacity of the country and
the legal system.

25
00:01:06,181 --> 00:01:09,840
And because they have value,
because you pay your taxes with them and

26
00:01:09,841 --> 00:01:12,630
then they just float freely in exchange
rates.

27
00:01:12,631 --> 00:01:16,800
So they very against each other in the,
because the dollar is used to buy oil as

28
00:01:16,801 --> 00:01:19,560
the world reserve currency and all the
other currencies and measured against

29
00:01:19,561 --> 00:01:21,780
it,
but there is no gold and,

30
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:22,590
and that's fine.

31
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,690
That doesn't mean it doesn't have value.
It absolutely has.

32
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,000
That fucks up a lot of old action
movies,

33
00:01:27,001 --> 00:01:27,960
man.
Yeah,

34
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:30,450
it really does.
Those movies where you would break into

35
00:01:30,451 --> 00:01:31,480
the vault.
Yeah.

36
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:34,380
Lone ranger.
The bars of gold would always be brick

37
00:01:34,381 --> 00:01:36,790
shaped.
Well the thing is gold isn't,

38
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:41,490
that's efficient for building a currency
on because the rates of which you can

39
00:01:41,491 --> 00:01:42,980
produce gold,
um,

40
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,450
is his face.
Then it's hoarded and you know,

41
00:01:45,451 --> 00:01:47,460
you have certain problems.
Now,

42
00:01:47,461 --> 00:01:49,560
the Nice thing about bitcoin is that it
takes,

43
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,500
um,
it takes the same concept of,

44
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:54,930
of scarcity a,
of having something that is a limited

45
00:01:54,931 --> 00:01:57,480
resource,
but it does it by algorithm.

46
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:02,160
So you essentially have math that says
that every 10 minutes,

47
00:02:02,161 --> 00:02:07,161
25 new bitcoin is created by the network
as a whole with all of the computing

48
00:02:07,201 --> 00:02:10,860
capacity of the network.
And that's fixed.

49
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:14,280
And every four years we create half as
much every 10 minutes.

50
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,310
So in four years it goes down to 12 and
a half bitcoin every 10 minutes.

51
00:02:17,311 --> 00:02:20,160
And then it goes down to six and a
quarter and it keeps going down until

52
00:02:20,161 --> 00:02:24,000
you meant the last bit coin.
And then you're done 21 million coins,

53
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,000
it's done.
And the idea is that you provide a sound

54
00:02:27,001 --> 00:02:28,860
basis for money.
Something that is rare,

55
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,680
cannot be forged,
is easily transportable.

56
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:36,210
And that is the form of currency.
So 21 million bitcoins and then it's

57
00:02:36,211 --> 00:02:37,720
over.
There will be theirs.

58
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,590
You can divide a Bitcoin,
100 million pieces.

59
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:45,030
So it goes down to a digits.
And that means the lowest units has

60
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:47,550
called a Sitoshi.
And there's 100 million satoshis in a

61
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,700
bitcoin.
So 21 million times 100 million,

62
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,460
21 quadrillion coins,
coins,

63
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,310
Jesus Christ.
Why am,

64
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:59,040
why is it so complicated?
Why is it like 100 million?

65
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,640
Um,
well I think part of the reason is that

66
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:07,720
it's easier to write a number without a
decimal points and just to write a small

67
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:09,550
leak units with lots of Zeros after it.

68
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,310
Um,
it's easier in computer terms to handle

69
00:03:12,311 --> 00:03:13,660
numbers that way,
but,

70
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,000
but most importantly,
it doesn't matter because what you see

71
00:03:16,001 --> 00:03:18,460
on your screen at today might be a bit
coin.

72
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:22,510
Actually on my wallets,
I use millibitcoins thousands of a

73
00:03:22,511 --> 00:03:25,210
bitcoin because of corresponds more to
my daily purchases.

74
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,060
You know,
maybe a few years from now you're going

75
00:03:27,061 --> 00:03:30,220
to be using a millions of a bitcoin to
look at your balance.

76
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,950
It doesn't matter what you call a unit.
Uh,

77
00:03:32,951 --> 00:03:36,340
the point is what value does it have
because someone else is willing to give

78
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,500
you that amount of money.
You know,

79
00:03:38,501 --> 00:03:40,240
I was Mormon.
Did we have this conversation?

80
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:42,430
I'm not sure.
Sure.

81
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,830
He was raised Mormon.
Really?

82
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,010
Yeah.
My folks are still,

83
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,830
well my dad's still mormon.
His whole side of the family or are you

84
00:03:47,831 --> 00:03:49,480
from Utah Now?
I'm from Texas.

85
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:50,890
Wow.
Mormon Texas.

86
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:52,020
There's a,
I mean,

87
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,920
they're fucking everywhere.
They're everywhere.

88
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:54,821
But uh,
yeah,

89
00:03:54,821 --> 00:03:56,060
born and raised.
Um,

90
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,450
less attrition is 14.
Wow.

91
00:03:58,451 --> 00:04:02,050
When you were 14,
what was it that got you to I just

92
00:04:02,051 --> 00:04:02,884
didn't like,
I was,

93
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:03,880
it's,
it's so funny too,

94
00:04:03,881 --> 00:04:06,400
because I hadn't found science yet.
It's not like I knew,

95
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,140
you know,
I didn't have like all these answers

96
00:04:08,141 --> 00:04:11,050
available to me.
I just probably around like 12,

97
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,630
maybe 11,
like when you start questioning things,

98
00:04:13,631 --> 00:04:16,840
I really started questioning things and
a lot of things weren't making sense for

99
00:04:16,841 --> 00:04:17,674
me.
And,

100
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:18,491
uh,
you know,

101
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:21,280
just a lot of the answers that they give
you in the church like weren't sitting

102
00:04:21,281 --> 00:04:21,820
well with me.

103
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:25,030
And so I was studying and I was trying
to figure out like,

104
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,680
you know,
I've been taught this is my whole life,

105
00:04:26,681 --> 00:04:29,590
but it just doesn't make sense.
It doesn't sit well with reality.

106
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,600
And I remember going to my father and
saying,

107
00:04:31,601 --> 00:04:32,800
you know,
I have all these questions.

108
00:04:32,801 --> 00:04:34,240
I'm very confused.
I'm not sure.

109
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:36,670
I believe,
and the answer they always give you is

110
00:04:36,671 --> 00:04:38,200
just to like really pray about it.
You know,

111
00:04:38,201 --> 00:04:40,780
it's like they give you all of these
answers that aren't helping at all.

112
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:43,090
They don't,
they don't really improve your confusion

113
00:04:43,091 --> 00:04:45,790
at all.
And so ultimately I finally just came to

114
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:46,310
him and said,
like,

115
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,140
I,
I,

116
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:50,600
I'm pretty sure at this point that I
really don't believe in God and an

117
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,680
attending,
which is a huge part of your life when

118
00:04:53,681 --> 00:04:54,550
you're 14.
I mean,

119
00:04:54,551 --> 00:04:56,350
when you're in high school and you're
Mormon,

120
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,870
you go to church for three hours every
Sunday,

121
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:01,240
you go to youth group every Wednesday
night,

122
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:04,150
you have all sorts of family things like
family home evening every Monday night.

123
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:07,570
And then you go to seminary,
which is either Bible Book of Mormon,

124
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:09,520
uh,
and then like pearl of great price in

125
00:05:09,521 --> 00:05:11,060
doctrine and covenants study.
Um,

126
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:15,220
every morning before school I would go
at 6:00 AM for like an hour before

127
00:05:15,221 --> 00:05:16,450
school.
And it's,

128
00:05:16,451 --> 00:05:17,710
I mean,
it's really intense.

129
00:05:17,711 --> 00:05:20,920
It takes up a huge part of your life.
And when you don't believe it's kind of,

130
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:23,730
I mean you have to come out,
you have to come out like it's,

131
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,830
it's so painful,
like you're stuck in this skin that's

132
00:05:26,831 --> 00:05:28,240
not you.
And I mean,

133
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,390
obviously,
I don't know what it's like for somebody

134
00:05:31,391 --> 00:05:33,580
who is gay who's like,
you know,

135
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:36,580
scared to come out in their community.
But,

136
00:05:36,581 --> 00:05:38,740
um,
I would assume that there's like at

137
00:05:38,741 --> 00:05:41,110
least a faint similarity to that feeling
of like,

138
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,610
I can't live like this because I'm lying
to myself or day.

139
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:47,410
So I finally came out to my father and
it was like not good.

140
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:50,650
It was a difficult situation.
It was hard for the family and I didn't

141
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:51,251
end up,
like,

142
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:54,310
I ended up actually not having a
relationship with him for many years.

143
00:05:54,311 --> 00:05:54,700
It's,
it's,

144
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,100
it's better now,
but at the time it was like a really

145
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,450
intense thing,
like as a 14 year old kid to be like,

146
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:02,300
oh,
I need to make this like really intense

147
00:06:02,301 --> 00:06:05,420
life decision.
So your dad didn't want to interact with

148
00:06:05,421 --> 00:06:09,200
you or you didn't want to interact with
him because of the pressure?

149
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,041
It was like,
so,

150
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:13,580
so my parents were divorced,
so I went to my dad's house every other

151
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,070
weekend and then like,
I think like a month in the summer or

152
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:18,260
something like that.
But we also went to his house on Sundays

153
00:06:18,261 --> 00:06:20,990
to go to church together because my mom
wasn't attending after they got

154
00:06:20,991 --> 00:06:23,990
divorced.
And so he basically told me,

155
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:25,430
um,
I remember the quote to this day,

156
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:28,610
I have a moral obligation to God to
force you to go to church until you're

157
00:06:28,611 --> 00:06:31,100
18 years old,
as long as you're living under my roof.

158
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:32,810
And I was like,
I'm not going to go anymore.

159
00:06:32,811 --> 00:06:33,381
And he was like,
well,

160
00:06:33,381 --> 00:06:35,360
then I guess you're not going to live
under my roof anymore.

161
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,550
Yeah.
So it was a really tough decision.

162
00:06:37,551 --> 00:06:40,370
It was kind of like me or me or your
atheism.

163
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:45,140
And at the time I just felt like I can't
not make this decision.

164
00:06:45,141 --> 00:06:48,110
So we didn't speak for a long time.
And I like didn't go to his house for a

165
00:06:48,111 --> 00:06:49,580
really long time.
We didn't have a relationship,

166
00:06:49,581 --> 00:06:50,630
but it improved.
