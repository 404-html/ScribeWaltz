1
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:05,010
Three two,
one.

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,040
And we're live gentleman,
Doctor Neil Riordan,

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,450
my saying that right?
Yes sir.

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:10,760
And Mel Gibson,
how are you sir?

5
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:11,613
Hey,
how you doing?

6
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,760
A welcome on board folks.
First of all,

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,990
thanks for coming here.
Really appreciate it.

8
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,390
Very nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you too.

9
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:19,920
So this,
uh,

10
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,440
you wanted to come in and talk about
stem cells.

11
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,160
Yeah.
So what is,

12
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,180
what's your experience been and what
does,

13
00:00:26,181 --> 00:00:27,014
what does,
uh,

14
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,670
what's this calling that you have here?
Well,

15
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,193
I was,
uh,

16
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:31,980
initially

17
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,020
Chile.
It was for my dad who was,

18
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,350
you know,
he was 92 and uh,

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,530
and he was doing all the old man stuff,
you know,

20
00:00:40,531 --> 00:00:42,590
his hip was killing him and he was like,
uh,

21
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,790
he had,
he had multiple problems.

22
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:46,890
I mean,
I won't get into the whole litany of

23
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,870
complaints,
but hey,

24
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:50,820
you know,
your engine starts wearing out,

25
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,150
you gotta replace the carburetor and a
few other things.

26
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:57,210
I took him to the Mayo Clinic,
great place.

27
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:00,030
If I ever get into serious trouble,
that's where I'm going.

28
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,410
And,
uh,

29
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,780
they were fantastic there,
but they were able to say,

30
00:01:03,781 --> 00:01:04,680
yeah,
you got to leave me here.

31
00:01:04,681 --> 00:01:06,450
It'd be dead in 48 hours.
I'm like,

32
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:07,650
oh.
So they,

33
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:12,630
they clocked every problem that he had.
Everything from,

34
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:15,180
you know,
the prostate to the,

35
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:16,950
to the hip,
to the kidneys,

36
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:18,060
to the heart,
to the lungs,

37
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:18,930
you know,
the whole deal.

38
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:21,060
And,
um,

39
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,123
he,
uh,

40
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:25,050
um,
you know,

41
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:26,430
they,
they stabilized him.

42
00:01:26,431 --> 00:01:26,941
They said,
okay,

43
00:01:26,941 --> 00:01:28,860
we'll do this and we'll do this.
And they did some,

44
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:34,020
you know,
Orthodox medical procedures all allowed

45
00:01:34,021 --> 00:01:35,490
in this country.
And,

46
00:01:35,491 --> 00:01:36,690
uh,
they were great.

47
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:38,663
But,
uh,

48
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,710
you know,
I still had reservations about him

49
00:01:40,711 --> 00:01:42,510
getting a hip replacement because he was
old.

50
00:01:42,511 --> 00:01:46,680
And of course,
just the recovery from a traumatic

51
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,290
surgery at that age is like,
it's a big deal.

52
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:50,483
And,
uh,

53
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:51,870
I thought,
well,

54
00:01:51,871 --> 00:01:53,070
what can I do?
And my brother says,

55
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:54,960
why don't you look into these adult stem
cells?

56
00:01:54,961 --> 00:01:55,830
I'm like,
Eh,

57
00:01:55,831 --> 00:01:58,710
you know,
I've heard things about this,

58
00:01:58,711 --> 00:02:00,450
you know,
you grow,

59
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:05,640
you grow a spare mouth on your head.
You ended up with an extra asshole or

60
00:02:05,641 --> 00:02:07,440
something.
But I was like,

61
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:08,490
okay,
we'll look into it.

62
00:02:08,491 --> 00:02:09,870
So we did.
And of course,

63
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,230
a buddy of mine who was a,
who was a Mayo Doc,

64
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,200
he said,
stay away from those witch doctors down

65
00:02:16,201 --> 00:02:17,010
in Panama.

66
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:20,040
He said,
it's like a leprosy and banana boats and

67
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:21,510
three legged dogs,
you know,

68
00:02:21,511 --> 00:02:24,210
and I'm like,
can we call him?

69
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,010
And so,
uh,

70
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,070
so brad and I got on the phone to Neil
and who else was it?

71
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,200
Doctor Pause or medical?
Yeah,

72
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,590
there was the two of these guys.
And um,

73
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,230
so they're talking highfalutin terms,
medical,

74
00:02:37,231 --> 00:02:38,580
all being Medicos,
you know,

75
00:02:38,581 --> 00:02:41,880
they sort of,
they know what a Mesenchymal stem cells

76
00:02:41,881 --> 00:02:42,900
are.
Mesenchymal,

77
00:02:42,901 --> 00:02:45,120
how do you say it misses linkable yet
Mesenchymal,

78
00:02:45,121 --> 00:02:46,290
you know,
and uh,

79
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,540
you know,
cytocon miss income,

80
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:50,100
all cytokines,
you know,

81
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:52,350
out of sight,
out of mind as far as I'm concerned.

82
00:02:52,351 --> 00:02:54,590
But it's like they,
uh,

83
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:58,440
they give us the wrist watch show over
the phone for about an hour and the

84
00:02:58,441 --> 00:02:59,980
doctor's asking them questions that

85
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,130
I can't even think of.
So when we hang up,

86
00:03:03,131 --> 00:03:03,660
I said,
no,

87
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,750
you know,
translate.

88
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:06,130
What does all that mean?
He's like,

89
00:03:06,131 --> 00:03:07,720
he translated a few things.
He says,

90
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:08,950
you know,
it sounds kind of interesting,

91
00:03:08,951 --> 00:03:09,910
pretty good,
you know,

92
00:03:09,911 --> 00:03:11,450
and from being a naysayer,
he said,

93
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:14,770
let's call him back.
And I think we called you right back.

94
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:16,270
And,
uh,

95
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:19,270
we spend another hour on the phone and
uh,

96
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,880
well to his credit,
uh,

97
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,320
Brad,
Brad ass for a bunch of literature.

98
00:03:23,321 --> 00:03:27,820
And I sent him maybe 30 articles and
most physicians wouldn't even look at

99
00:03:27,821 --> 00:03:30,250
it,
but it was all relevant to what hut had.

100
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,181
And,
uh,

101
00:03:31,181 --> 00:03:32,014
you know,
for the heart,

102
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,260
the heart problems and kidney problems
and,

103
00:03:34,261 --> 00:03:37,990
and orthopedic problems.
And he read all the articles and he

104
00:03:37,991 --> 00:03:39,490
read,
he read the upside,

105
00:03:39,491 --> 00:03:40,540
the downside,
and,

106
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:41,410
and,
and then,

107
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,250
then we had a,
to his credit and then we had a,

108
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:46,280
a very educated,
uh,

109
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:49,540
talk after conversation and which he,
and he was,

110
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:50,830
he was really,
you know,

111
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:52,890
by this time informed I,
and he,

112
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,060
he,
he just said to me,

113
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,913
well,
you know,

114
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,230
he's 92.

115
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,330
He says,
what the hell you got to lose?

116
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,141
And I said,
no,

117
00:03:59,141 --> 00:04:00,070
nothing,
let's go.

118
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,960
So I'm up for it.
We asked him,

119
00:04:01,961 --> 00:04:02,800
is he up for it?
He goes,

120
00:04:02,801 --> 00:04:04,150
hell yeah,
cause he's,

121
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,160
you know,
they took him into the hospital.

122
00:04:06,161 --> 00:04:07,360
He was 92.
And they said,

123
00:04:07,361 --> 00:04:08,950
what medications are you on?
He said,

124
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,900
I'm not on any.
And they said,

125
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:13,810
you're 92 years old.
How do you account for not being on any

126
00:04:13,811 --> 00:04:16,270
medications?
This is because I stay away from doctors

127
00:04:16,271 --> 00:04:19,330
and hospitals
and you know,

128
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:23,170
and he didn't have any problems.
He started to have have a rough trip.

129
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,550
Well,
uh,

130
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,560
we took them down there and he got,
uh,

131
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:29,200
I think it was like a double dose in the
hip.

132
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,710
I think you have to go,
this is not legal in America,

133
00:04:32,711 --> 00:04:35,710
is that what's going on right now?
There are clinical trials going on in

134
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:37,540
the u s but it's not broadly available.

135
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,940
And in Panama,
they passed the law in 2004,

136
00:04:39,941 --> 00:04:42,580
which allowed us,
allowed doctors actually to go down

137
00:04:42,581 --> 00:04:46,690
there to be able to treat people with
using adult stem cell.

138
00:04:46,691 --> 00:04:49,390
So the bill was actually designed to,
uh,

139
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,910
to prohibit the use of embryonic stem
cells.

140
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:56,380
And in at the same law,
they said it's okay to use adult stem

141
00:04:56,381 --> 00:04:58,330
cells,
including those from a biblical cord

142
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:01,480
basically from ethical sources.
And so,

143
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:04,780
um,
in Panama they gave us a,

144
00:05:04,781 --> 00:05:08,200
we have a license from the Ministry of
Health to manufacturer and use those

145
00:05:08,201 --> 00:05:10,990
cells in addition to doing clinical
trials there.

146
00:05:10,991 --> 00:05:13,720
So it's,
it's one place on the planet where you

147
00:05:13,721 --> 00:05:16,300
can get a really high quality umbilical
cord.

148
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,670
These,
this type of cell,

149
00:05:17,671 --> 00:05:20,380
there are two major kinds of stem cells.
We only work with one kind.

150
00:05:20,381 --> 00:05:22,360
The missoulian Kamala,
we just call it the mic.

151
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,550
It's a lot easier.
And um,

152
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:25,450
so anyway,
that's,

153
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,930
that's,
that's how I think we were actually,

154
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,180
we actually owned apartments in the same
building in Panama.

155
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,500
Never met each other.
And we met,

156
00:05:32,501 --> 00:05:35,920
we met through his brother finding us on
the Internet and then you go,

157
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,350
and then they brought him down to get
treatment.

158
00:05:38,351 --> 00:05:39,830
We were,
we were quite hesitant to,

159
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:40,840
to take him,
you know,

160
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,050
cause the last thing you don't want is
Mel,

161
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:46,510
Mel Gibson's dad to drop down in your
clinic and he wasn't in great shape,

162
00:05:46,511 --> 00:05:49,330
you know,
so he wasn't in good shape at all.

163
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:50,853
But,
uh,

164
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,630
you know,
as I recall when he got there,

165
00:05:52,631 --> 00:05:56,160
he was in a wheelchair and really wasn't
talking a lot and things like that and

166
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,650
having a pretty rough time.
And,

167
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,110
and then,
uh,

168
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:01,880
so we,
after getting medical clearance for him

169
00:06:01,881 --> 00:06:04,940
to actually fly down there and then
Melflin down there privately,

170
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,000
uh,
then we,

171
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:11,930
we did some ivs on him first in the
clinic and then to do the hip,

172
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,530
we need to do that piece.

173
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,700
What do you mean?
So we give the umbilical cord,

174
00:06:16,701 --> 00:06:17,540
these are,
these are,

175
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:19,860
uh,
isolated from the,

176
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,450
the basically the,
the meat of the umbilical cord.

177
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,310
Uh,
they're isolated and they're grown in

178
00:06:25,311 --> 00:06:30,311
our laboratory,
which is iso 9,001 and very high quality

179
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:33,110
and certified by the Ministry of Health.
Um,

180
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,390
the,
they're grown in the laboratory and

181
00:06:35,391 --> 00:06:38,870
they're certified to be free of
everything and in any kind of infectious

182
00:06:38,871 --> 00:06:39,620
disease.
And,

183
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,400
and,
uh,

184
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,430
I went into the clean rooms and then
make it put on hats and gloves and you

185
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,250
know,
you feel like all frankensteined out and

186
00:06:46,251 --> 00:06:49,700
you'll walk into these cold rooms and
you're watching cells divided under the

187
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:51,320
microscope.
It's kind of miraculous.

188
00:06:51,321 --> 00:06:55,360
Really look at this stuff.
So intravenous stem cells intravenously.

189
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,500
That's correct.
And what,

190
00:06:56,501 --> 00:06:58,160
what's the benefit of intravenous stem
cells?

191
00:06:58,161 --> 00:06:59,330
Like what does that do?
Well,

192
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:01,980
the good thing is that this,
this kind of stem cell,

193
00:07:01,981 --> 00:07:04,070
the Mesenchymal stem cells are found
throughout your body.

194
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,290
And they're the,
normally what they do is they,

195
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:09,680
they modulate your immune system,
they decrease inflammation,

196
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:11,630
and they stimulate regeneration.
So,

197
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:14,540
and the good thing about them is they
tend to home to areas where there is

198
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:16,910
inflammation.
So intravenously,

199
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,950
they do a lot of things,
uh,

200
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,720
and,
but they can home to areas of

201
00:07:20,721 --> 00:07:23,890
inflammation and uh,
and they,

202
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:28,430
they really reduce inflammation in the
body because they upregulate part of

203
00:07:28,431 --> 00:07:32,000
your immune system that controls the
inflammatory process,

204
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:35,120
which I can talk more about later.
But in his case,

205
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,670
you know,
his kidneys were in trouble.

206
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,580
His heart was in trouble.
And the cells,

207
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:44,180
they don't,
unlike what we used to think in the

208
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,500
early days,
they don't become anything.

209
00:07:45,501 --> 00:07:47,900
These kinds of,
this kind of stem cell does not become

210
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:49,820
anything in your body,
but at homestead,

211
00:07:49,821 --> 00:07:53,930
areas of that need repair and it
secretes things that stimulates the

212
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:57,530
repair and decrease the inflammation and
helps out with the immune system.

213
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:00,530
So the vast majority of what we treat
our autoimmune diseases,

214
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,800
and uh,
in,

215
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,900
in [inaudible] case we gave him iv so
that,

216
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,630
that he could basically have these
things on board,

217
00:08:08,631 --> 00:08:12,320
secreting,
secreting the cytokines and the,

218
00:08:12,321 --> 00:08:14,690
and the growth factors that are normally
secreted.

219
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,780
And when you're 92 and you have
multiorgan failure,

220
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,370
you're basically running on fumes.
And so you put these days zero young,

221
00:08:22,371 --> 00:08:26,840
healthy cells and they secrete these
things that kind of restarts everything.

222
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:30,200
Yeah.
And so what was his response to this Ivy

223
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:31,220
Treatment?
Wow.

224
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:32,150
Uh,
I,

225
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:32,900
you know,
I,

226
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,180
I could,
I can wax lyrical about that.

227
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:38,280
He's almost a hundred years old and,
uh,

228
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:41,330
from pretty bad shape.
It was like bee stings.

229
00:08:41,331 --> 00:08:46,331
It was like he got a new lease of life.
Like he got a big dose locally in the

230
00:08:46,521 --> 00:08:49,760
hip,
which a fixed all his inflammation and

231
00:08:49,761 --> 00:08:54,200
pain and he started walking again and
his kidneys were good and his heart,

232
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,910
he had a valves in there and they
healed.

233
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,040
And uh,
his,

234
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:01,440
um,
cognitive powers improved.

235
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,930
His eyesight improved.
Whoa.

236
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,270
You know,
and other stuff improved that I,

237
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,840
he would hate me to talk about it.

238
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,720
Two nurses that reported to me and it
was like,

239
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:19,040
holy mackerel,
using it as a towel rack.

240
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,800
Well,
Dan Bilzerian was telling me about

241
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,270
intravenous stem cells.
He's,

242
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:24,960
and so his boss route and you know,
boss,

243
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,460
former UFC heavyweight champion,
he went down and caught some,

244
00:09:28,461 --> 00:09:31,220
he's had some pretty significant neck
injuries and neck fusions.

245
00:09:31,221 --> 00:09:33,320
And he said he got intravenous stem
cells.

246
00:09:33,321 --> 00:09:35,490
The way he described his,
like with his Dutch accents,

247
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:38,300
like it was like I had lightning coming
off my fingers.

248
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,070
Did he go to you?
Yeah,

249
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,590
yeah,
yeah.

250
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:43,910
He said it was phenomenal.
I mean,

251
00:09:43,911 --> 00:09:46,430
he said it's one of the most incredible
experiences I've ever had.

252
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,850
The feeling of a regeneration of,
of energy.

253
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:54,080
Yeah.
I reach out to him by email and he,

254
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:58,330
and just to see if it'd be okay for me
to talk about him on here.

255
00:09:58,331 --> 00:09:59,021
And he said,
yeah,

256
00:09:59,021 --> 00:10:00,700
absolutely.
And you know,

257
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:01,613
uh,
his,

258
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:04,600
his cholesterol dropped all his numbers,
you know,

259
00:10:04,601 --> 00:10:07,930
the basically numbers associated with
aging all got better.

260
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:09,480
Um,
and,

261
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,700
and like you said,
he felt this tremendous energy for some

262
00:10:12,701 --> 00:10:14,260
period of time wise.
It's not legal here.

263
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:16,890
Well,
uh,

264
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:20,230
it,
it's considered to be a new drug by the

265
00:10:20,231 --> 00:10:25,231
FDA and that's the number one reason.
There are four countries so far that

266
00:10:25,661 --> 00:10:30,640
have approved MSC products.
There's Canada and New Zealand were the

267
00:10:30,641 --> 00:10:33,130
first to go to Canada and get this done.
Well,

268
00:10:33,131 --> 00:10:34,210
not for the,
only,

269
00:10:34,211 --> 00:10:36,340
only for certain conditions.
So in Canada,

270
00:10:36,341 --> 00:10:38,860
New Zealand,
they approved bone marrow mscs,

271
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:42,940
which are in my mind are not as good as
umbilical cord.

272
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,860
And I explain why.
Um,

273
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,250
and,
and then South Korea as approved

274
00:10:48,251 --> 00:10:51,940
umbilical cord for knee osteoarthritis
only so the cells have to be injected

275
00:10:51,941 --> 00:10:55,120
into the knee.
And then Japan just recently approved

276
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:56,490
the same product.
That's it.

277
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,010
It's used to treat a very serious acute
graph,

278
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:05,170
acute graft versus host disease in
children after they've had a bone marrow

279
00:11:05,171 --> 00:11:05,800
transplant.

280
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:10,270
Now are there peer reviewed studies or
anything that shows the efficacy of this

281
00:11:10,271 --> 00:11:11,920
intravenous use of these stem cells?

282
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,180
Yeah,
there,

283
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:16,090
there are hundreds.
There are hundreds and my book MSC,

284
00:11:16,091 --> 00:11:16,990
which is,
you know,

285
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:19,450
you don't want to read it unless you
want to go to sleep unless you're

286
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:20,950
looking for something,
you know,

287
00:11:20,951 --> 00:11:24,820
it's just,
it really is purely a research tool.

288
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,240
Um,
we have 800 references and we reference

289
00:11:28,241 --> 00:11:31,300
every clinical trial that's ever been
done with mscs and human beings and

290
00:11:31,301 --> 00:11:32,670
there are 800 of them.
Yeah.

291
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,700
Well I've had some great results with
stem cells.

292
00:11:35,701 --> 00:11:38,490
Doctor Rati Mcgee in Las Vegas.
A shot,

293
00:11:38,491 --> 00:11:42,030
a bunch into my shoulder.
I was at the door of surgery.

294
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,280
I was like my shoulders and pain all the
time.

295
00:11:44,281 --> 00:11:46,110
I can't do a lot.
Every time I do something,

296
00:11:46,111 --> 00:11:49,380
I have to ice it down for a day and now
I have full function.

297
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,640
I mean,
it's crazy.

298
00:11:50,641 --> 00:11:51,411
I mean,
I was literally,

299
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:53,830
I mean it still clicks.
I've got some weird shit in there and

300
00:11:53,831 --> 00:11:54,190
there's probably

301
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:57,400
some stuff floating around in there.
But as far as like the function of my

302
00:11:57,401 --> 00:11:59,230
shoulder and the,
the pain,

303
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:01,810
it's like 100% I can do basically
everything.

304
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:02,490
Right,

305
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:03,090
right.
Yeah.

306
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:05,990
Yeah.
I was 57 58 years old and this is like

307
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:08,160
what,
four or five years ago?

308
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:11,790
And both my shoulders torn labor rooms,
arthritis,

309
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:14,370
bone spurs,
like rotator cuff issues.

310
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:19,260
And I went down and I got 10 billion
cells in each shoulder.

311
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,290
I said to the doc,
you know,

312
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:22,350
is this going to hurt?
And he says,

313
00:12:22,351 --> 00:12:26,330
only when it comes out the other side.
But he put it in and it,

314
00:12:26,331 --> 00:12:28,830
it was,
you could feel them pierce the capsule

315
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:32,850
and you could feel pressure.
And,

316
00:12:32,851 --> 00:12:34,680
uh,
I couldn't flap my wings for three days,

317
00:12:34,681 --> 00:12:36,570
but after that,
no more problems.

318
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,510
And this is different than the stem
cells that you can get in the United

319
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:40,620
States currently.
Yeah.

320
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:44,550
What's the difference
from umbilical cords?

321
00:12:44,551 --> 00:12:46,260
I had a,
what is it called?

322
00:12:46,261 --> 00:12:48,180
What's the kind that you can get here in
the United States?

323
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:49,740
Well,
you can use the only thing that's

324
00:12:49,741 --> 00:12:53,250
legally legal in the u s at least for
now,

325
00:12:53,251 --> 00:12:55,920
I don't think it's going to be last much
longer as from amnion.

326
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,530
Yeah,
there's an exemption in the,

327
00:12:58,531 --> 00:13:01,980
uh,
it's a federal federal exemption for the

328
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:05,430
use of amnion for wound covering.
And a lot of people have now translated,

329
00:13:05,431 --> 00:13:08,940
now they're using it in joints and
things like that.

330
00:13:08,941 --> 00:13:11,520
But you don't think they're going to be
able to do that very much longer?

331
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,810
I don't believe so.
Why is that?

332
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:16,890
Cause this commissioner FDA Commissioner
has made it very clear that he doesn't

333
00:13:16,891 --> 00:13:20,430
like it and they really haven't liked it
for quite some time.

334
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:21,840
Uh,
because the,

335
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:24,060
the exemption is for one thing and,
and,

336
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,240
and doctors are using it for all kinds
of other things.

337
00:13:27,241 --> 00:13:29,070
I don't necessarily agree with it.
I just,

338
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:33,120
I just know what's coming down the pike
from a regulatory standpoint.

339
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:34,301
Uh,
and,

340
00:13:34,301 --> 00:13:36,450
and you know,
there've been some regulatory things

341
00:13:36,451 --> 00:13:38,970
that have come out.
They've gone after clinics and you know,

342
00:13:38,971 --> 00:13:43,230
I think they've shut down three places
just in the last couple of months and

343
00:13:43,231 --> 00:13:46,020
they haven't gone after amnion yet.
But I think they're building their case

344
00:13:46,021 --> 00:13:49,020
for it.
And unfortunately that's what's going to

345
00:13:49,021 --> 00:13:49,590
happen.
No,

346
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:51,840
why would they go after it?
That's what's confusing.

347
00:13:51,841 --> 00:13:55,050
If you seen all these benefits and I
haven't heard anything about negative

348
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,690
results.
Yeah,

349
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,760
I don't,
I don't understand it myself,

350
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:00,790
to be honest with you.
It's,

351
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,610
you know,
amnion it's been used clinically in the

352
00:14:02,611 --> 00:14:04,710
United States for over a hundred years,
uh,

353
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,930
without serious adverse events.

354
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:07,820
But,
um,

355
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:11,260
I think it's more about the claims that
people are making because they're,

356
00:14:11,261 --> 00:14:13,920
there haven't been studies,
for example,

357
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:15,290
of Amnion,
you know,

358
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:20,190
amnion tissue injected into a joint.
And I think that the biggest concern is

359
00:14:20,191 --> 00:14:23,440
the claims that are being made and maybe
people are being vulnerably,

360
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:24,860
you know,
I dunno,

361
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:28,380
some vulnerable to the economics of it.
I'm not really sure,

362
00:14:28,381 --> 00:14:32,780
but I know that I just,
I have my finger on the pulse and,

363
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,940
and that's,
it seems like they're there.

364
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:36,960
They've gone after fat.
You know,

365
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:41,990
we were the first in the world to use
fat derived stem cells in 2006 and 2007

366
00:14:42,661 --> 00:14:47,661
we published in on using those to treat
rheumatoid arthritis and multiple

367
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:52,040
sclerosis a and then a lot of doctors in
the u s started doing that now.

368
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:56,360
Now there's new guidance to industry
that came out a few months ago that

369
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:59,600
specifically prohibits using it for,
for example,

370
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:03,050
taking your own fat,
isolating the stem cells out of it,

371
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:07,280
and then injecting them in your
bloodstream or even a document to a

372
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:08,114
joint.

373
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,130
So,
um,

374
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,173
it,
I,

375
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,190
I don't,
I don't really know the whole,

376
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:16,460
the motivation behind it,
but I know that they,

377
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,930
they very clearly stated that that's not
going to fly anymore.

378
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,120
So the stuff that you did for mel
shoulder,

379
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,770
what,
what exactly was that?

380
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:29,600
That's basically a new drug product.
It could be considered a new drug

381
00:15:29,601 --> 00:15:32,420
product in the U S and we are in
clinical trials in the U s we've

382
00:15:32,421 --> 00:15:32,901
already,
we're,

383
00:15:32,901 --> 00:15:35,750
we have to imds for the treatment
additions,

384
00:15:35,751 --> 00:15:38,630
muscular dystrophy,
and we're just going to start a spinal

385
00:15:38,631 --> 00:15:40,610
cord injury trial.
University of Miami.

386
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:42,400
And uh,
and uh,

387
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:46,130
Thomas Jefferson University.
We got funding from the Marcus

388
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:48,450
Foundation.
Bernie Marcus is one of our clients and

389
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,320
he sees all these kids with spinal cord
injury getting better.

390
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:54,080
And so our product is,
we,

391
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:57,110
we,
we were able to figure out which cells

392
00:15:57,111 --> 00:15:57,980
work,
which,

393
00:15:57,981 --> 00:16:02,090
which umbilical cords give cells that
are really useful and which ones aren't.

394
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:05,600
So we throw away the vast majority of
the umbilical cords that we get.

395
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:07,430
You tell.
Well,

396
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:10,010
we,
we had the advantage of having thousands

397
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:11,690
of cases and,
and I'll get,

398
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:17,200
I'll give you an example of one case of
a football coach from Dallas where I

399
00:16:18,231 --> 00:16:21,530
live.
And he had diagnosed with Ms. He was in

400
00:16:21,531 --> 00:16:23,450
and out of wheelchair,
was on,

401
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,980
you know,
basically out.

402
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,420
Um,
and,

403
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:29,060
uh,
he was out on disability and retired

404
00:16:29,061 --> 00:16:31,640
from a very successful at three time
state champion in Texas.

405
00:16:31,641 --> 00:16:33,740
That's really saying something.
Um,

406
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:39,610
and he came down in 2010 for the first
treatment and we gave him the treatment

407
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:42,830
and he got much better and improve for
about 14 months.

408
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:47,210
And then he came back again in 2011 and
got another treatment improved,

409
00:16:47,211 --> 00:16:52,211
not as much as the first time.
And He came down in 2012 and boom,

410
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:53,510
all of his symptoms were gone.

411
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:57,440
And now he's back coaching and he is
completely normal.

412
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,300
He's probably,
you know,

413
00:16:59,301 --> 00:17:00,680
he's,
he's a junior,

414
00:17:00,681 --> 00:17:02,900
he's a bit younger than me,
but he's probably healthier than me.

415
00:17:02,901 --> 00:17:04,250
I mean,
the guy works out all the time.

416
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:07,220
He's out there on the field.
He doesn't have any heat intolerance.

417
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:08,790
It didn't have any problems.
Uh,

418
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:12,710
so I want her to know what's the
difference between those cells in 2012

419
00:17:12,711 --> 00:17:16,550
and the ones in 2011 and one of the 2010
and then we took other cases similar to

420
00:17:16,551 --> 00:17:20,300
that where we'd had less than
spectacular result.

421
00:17:20,301 --> 00:17:22,220
I mean there's still good results,
but they weren't,

422
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,230
you know,
but boom.

423
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:29,150
And so he took cells from those
different lots and we grew them up and

424
00:17:29,151 --> 00:17:32,990
then we had them analyze for 1200
different molecules that they express.

425
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,560
And we found that these cells,
we call them our golden cells because

426
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:39,650
they,
they just seem to work all the time.

427
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,920
And we found that they under express
certain proteins.

428
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,590
And then so early on in the culture
process,

429
00:17:45,591 --> 00:17:47,030
we can select for those and say,
Hey,

430
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,140
these are golden cells,
these aren't throw him out.

431
00:17:49,141 --> 00:17:51,390
And so he throw it,
we throw a whole bunch out and we keep

432
00:17:51,391 --> 00:17:53,070
the golden cells and then we grow those
up.

433
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:55,080
And those are the only cells that we
use.

434
00:17:55,081 --> 00:17:56,580
So that,
that's the big,

435
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:00,050
the big difference in the advantage we
have is that we've had all those cases,

436
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:03,120
we're able to look back retrospectively
at which sells,

437
00:18:03,121 --> 00:18:06,150
really work,
then analyze them from a molecular basis

438
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,110
and then now we can select using that.
So

439
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,770
when mel came in with his shoulder
injuries,

440
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,040
June an MRI first,
um,

441
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,450
he had one,
but we didn't do it there.

442
00:18:16,451 --> 00:18:17,350
But he had one.
Yeah,

443
00:18:17,351 --> 00:18:21,060
let's do a follow up Mri.
We did not know a lot of,

444
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,280
we do a lot.
It was great.

445
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,230
So you don't even bother.
This is good.

446
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,660
I don't bother.
It's like my dad was walking with that

447
00:18:25,661 --> 00:18:26,780
pain,
you know,

448
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,200
his hip was dissolved.
He was doing okay.

449
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,730
Wow.
And so,

450
00:18:30,731 --> 00:18:33,280
um,
are you still no problems with the

451
00:18:33,281 --> 00:18:34,630
shoulder?
How long ago did you have that done?

452
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:35,381
Oh,
when was it?

453
00:18:35,381 --> 00:18:36,280
I had it done twice.

454
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:39,720
It was,
I went 18 months and then I started it

455
00:18:39,721 --> 00:18:43,500
started to return the symptoms of
discomfort,

456
00:18:43,501 --> 00:18:46,590
pain.
And so I did it again and like,

457
00:18:46,591 --> 00:18:48,870
it's been like couple of years,
almost three years.

458
00:18:48,871 --> 00:18:50,310
It's fine.
Wow.

459
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,290
Yeah.

460
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:53,810
Yeah.
I was really impressed with what I was

461
00:18:53,811 --> 00:18:57,980
able to get done,
but the stuff that I wish I had Dr.

462
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:00,740
McGee telling me exactly what it was,
the stuff that he,

463
00:19:00,741 --> 00:19:04,400
they had done to me about a year and a
half ago is no longer available.

464
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:07,520
Um,
they decided that it was considered a

465
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:09,350
drug and uh,
they,

466
00:19:09,351 --> 00:19:13,970
they weren't allowing that form of a
amniotic stem cell treatment.

467
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:17,090
So now there's a less effective but
still effective form.

468
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:19,580
Right.
So it seems like there is some sort of

469
00:19:19,581 --> 00:19:22,280
an effort afoot to diminish this in the
United States.

470
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,590
Yeah,
well I think they just want to control

471
00:19:24,591 --> 00:19:25,440
it and they want,
you know,

472
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:29,060
they want it all to go through their
deal and their process.

473
00:19:29,061 --> 00:19:32,420
But in the meantime,
a lot of people are probably suffering

474
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:35,210
from some pretty significant injuries
that they could deal with,

475
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,840
with that far easier if this could
somehow or another be sped up.

476
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,760
Absolutely agree with that.
Yeah.

477
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:43,310
So when did you start doing this?
Down in Panama?

478
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:47,420
Um,
we started there in 2006 and just

479
00:19:47,421 --> 00:19:48,850
because of the regulations,
right?

480
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:49,740
We found out about how about

481
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:53,820
the regulations around 2006 and,
and we went straight there and once we

482
00:19:53,821 --> 00:19:58,230
found that law,
the law was passed in 2004 and then we

483
00:19:58,231 --> 00:20:00,150
found out about it and we went down
there and,

484
00:20:00,151 --> 00:20:01,720
uh,
we built our lab out.

485
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:05,250
We were actually functional in 2007.
So it's,

486
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,710
uh,
we're having our 10 year anniversary.

487
00:20:07,711 --> 00:20:09,810
What's it like in Panama?
Never been a Panama.

488
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,610
Is it weird?
It seems like it's cool.

489
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,140
You like it?
Yeah.

490
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,530
It's cool.
Yeah,

491
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:18,030
it's very,
it's real friendly with the u s I think

492
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,070
that's the currency has been there as US
dollars.

493
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:21,240
Oh really?
It goes further?

494
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,340
Yeah.
They use US dollars.

495
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:24,240
Yeah.
Oh Wow.

496
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:25,500
Yeah.
These US dollars.

497
00:20:25,501 --> 00:20:30,430
I mean we kind of ran that joint for
many years until 1999 when they would

498
00:20:30,431 --> 00:20:34,260
gave the canal back and that was pretty
much the vast majority of the economy.

499
00:20:34,261 --> 00:20:37,200
So when we gave that back to them then
they just kept the dollar.

500
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:39,000
And uh,
it's been,

501
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:41,010
you know,
the explosive growth,

502
00:20:41,011 --> 00:20:42,640
it looks like Miami now.
So,

503
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,690
you know,
my bill at the building I live in is 70

504
00:20:45,691 --> 00:20:47,560
stories tall and it's not even the
building,

505
00:20:47,561 --> 00:20:48,394
you know.
So there's,

506
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:51,940
there are,
our clinic is on the 63rd floor of a 65

507
00:20:51,941 --> 00:20:54,010
story building and it just full of high
rises.

508
00:20:54,011 --> 00:20:57,400
And of course there's a little bit too
much traffic if you get that much

509
00:20:57,401 --> 00:20:59,200
concentration of people in one place.
But,

510
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:01,810
um,
fantastic restaurants,

511
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,880
movie theaters,
mall shopping,

512
00:21:03,881 --> 00:21:05,440
high end shopping malls,
you name it,

513
00:21:05,441 --> 00:21:07,240
you got everything that you want down
there.

514
00:21:07,241 --> 00:21:08,830
And you know,
I'd love to spend time,

515
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:11,560
I spend a third of my time down there.
It's friendly and it's relative,

516
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:12,610
you know,
it's not dangerous.

517
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:17,080
Wow.
So you have people that you,

518
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:20,610
that hear about you from the United
States and they find out about your,

519
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:23,020
your treatment and then fly down to
Panama to get treated.

520
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:24,123
Yeah,
that's right.

521
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:28,150
Not just the u s but probably the
majority of the clients are from the u s

522
00:21:28,151 --> 00:21:32,380
and then we'd have people from all other
places around the globe.

523
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:37,060
Do you anticipate this moon back to the
United States in any way or is this

524
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:40,510
something that the hurdles are so steep
that it's going to take a long time?

525
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:42,850
I think we're going to figure out a way
to do it.

526
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,460
You know,
I think ultimately we're going to do it.

527
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:46,440
Um,
we're,

528
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:47,530
you know,
just having,

529
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:50,950
we were the first to get an eye to treat
a human being in the United States with

530
00:21:50,951 --> 00:21:51,970
these cells.
And,

531
00:21:51,971 --> 00:21:53,630
uh,
that was three and a half years ago with

532
00:21:53,631 --> 00:21:55,870
the young man with the shins,
muscular dystrophy.

533
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:56,950
And My,
you know,

534
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:59,770
my other book that's hopefully
interesting to read.

535
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:02,350
It starts and finishes with his case
where,

536
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:03,611
um,
we were,

537
00:22:03,611 --> 00:22:06,850
we traded him in Panama for a number of
years and then we just petitioned the

538
00:22:06,851 --> 00:22:08,890
FDA and said,
it's kind of ridiculous for us to do

539
00:22:08,891 --> 00:22:10,810
this down there.

540
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:13,720
Please allow us to do it.
So we're using the cells that we,

541
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:16,480
we isolated and uh,
expanded in Panama.

542
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:19,030
We're using it to treat him and another,
uh,

543
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:21,880
now a seven year old with Duchenne's
muscular dystrophy.

544
00:22:21,881 --> 00:22:25,990
So that was the first wedge.
And then our next wedge is going to be

545
00:22:25,991 --> 00:22:27,960
for spinal cord injury.
And uh,

546
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:30,760
there,
there a number of clinical trials that

547
00:22:30,761 --> 00:22:31,890
are going on,
not,

548
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:36,430
not just outside the u s are a number of
going on in the u s the biggest hurdle

549
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:40,390
is that a new drug,
if you look at the last several years,

550
00:22:40,391 --> 00:22:43,540
cost two and a half billion dollars to
get to market.

551
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,160
And,
uh,

552
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:48,280
unless we do something a little bit
differently on the regulatory side,

553
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,830
it's going to be,
it's gonna be Kinda hard to do this.

554
00:22:50,831 --> 00:22:55,831
Japan has a law that went into effect
two years ago that basically allows you,

555
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,440
allows you to,
once you demonstrate your product is

556
00:22:59,441 --> 00:23:01,330
safe,
then you can go ahead and start

557
00:23:01,331 --> 00:23:03,670
marketing it and then you have seven
years in which to,

558
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,860
to demonstrate efficacy.

559
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:07,870
So safety first,
then efficacy,

560
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,860
and that's resulted in four,
four new drugs already and in less than

561
00:23:11,861 --> 00:23:13,200
two years.
And uh,

562
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:17,830
we have zero zero cell,
the only sell product that's,

563
00:23:17,831 --> 00:23:21,620
that's approved by FDA as umbilical cord
blood for the treatment of,

564
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,260
uh,
when you're doing a bone marrow

565
00:23:23,261 --> 00:23:24,910
transplant,
that's the only thing that's approved.

566
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:28,210
Now is there an argument for that?
Like they just being cautious,

567
00:23:28,211 --> 00:23:31,090
they want to make sure that there's no
adverse side effects that could really

568
00:23:31,091 --> 00:23:33,070
be significant.
Yeah,

569
00:23:33,071 --> 00:23:35,950
I think there is an argument there.
There's an argument that they want it.

570
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:39,370
They want to err on the side of safety.
I mean that's their number one priority

571
00:23:39,371 --> 00:23:41,020
is to,
is to create,

572
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:44,410
uh,
create a safe environment for receiving

573
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,640
medicines in the,
in the United States.

574
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:48,220
Um,
I,

575
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:52,460
I think the model is a little bit,
there's a little bit antiquated for the

576
00:23:52,461 --> 00:23:55,310
cell products just because they are
natural products.

577
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:57,080
I mean,
if you think about it,

578
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:59,570
uh,
every woman that's ever given birth to a

579
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:02,060
baby,
they have stem cells from their baby in

580
00:24:02,061 --> 00:24:03,830
them.
These MSC is,

581
00:24:03,831 --> 00:24:07,340
you can find them 50 years later and
they're not toxic.

582
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:12,390
And we wouldn't exist as a species if
there is a inherent toxicity to a

583
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:16,460
genetically distinct cells because the
cells are 50% mom,

584
00:24:16,461 --> 00:24:20,060
50% dad and there you can find them in
mom,

585
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:22,520
you know,
for her entire life.

586
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,740
Um,
so the,

587
00:24:24,741 --> 00:24:28,010
and the cures act was supposed to,
we're supposed to address some of that

588
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:31,340
and we'll see that that went into effect
last year and we'll see,

589
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,980
uh,
going forward if that actually does

590
00:24:33,981 --> 00:24:34,820
affect things.

591
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:38,690
Now I know that they're doing some stuff
in the United States where they're

592
00:24:38,691 --> 00:24:42,680
injecting them into disks.
This is a new thing to regenerate disc

593
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:46,970
tissue for people that have degenerative
disc disease and bulging discs and disc

594
00:24:46,971 --> 00:24:51,080
injuries and a,
as an alternative to either artificial

595
00:24:51,081 --> 00:24:54,770
discs or fusion as a first step before
they move into those.

596
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,300
Do you do any of that down there?

597
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:58,710
Um,
we don't do any right now.

598
00:24:58,740 --> 00:24:59,573
Uh,
we're,

599
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:01,600
we're working with a hospital that
we're,

600
00:25:01,601 --> 00:25:05,610
we're actually going to,
we're going to have a room just for

601
00:25:05,611 --> 00:25:06,780
doing backs,
just,

602
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:10,350
just for doing spine because there are
study that has study out of Europe.

603
00:25:10,351 --> 00:25:14,880
Just came out a couple of months ago and
it showed about 50% of the patients had

604
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:19,020
their disks become normal on Mri after
treatment.

605
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:21,300
So it's not every case,
but I would,

606
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:23,460
I'd take a 50,
50 shot versus having a,

607
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,810
having a fusion.
Right.

608
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,560
Yeah.
So that's the same sort of situation

609
00:25:26,561 --> 00:25:29,290
that we're talking about where you're
injecting it right into the desks.

610
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:31,000
Yeah.
And you can,

611
00:25:31,001 --> 00:25:31,990
in the United States,
you know,

612
00:25:31,991 --> 00:25:34,300
we have a clinic in Dallas,
uh,

613
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:39,660
that the RMI clinic where we,
we can do bone marrow,

614
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:40,740
right.
And,

615
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:43,150
and so we use bone,
autologous bone marrow,

616
00:25:43,151 --> 00:25:47,680
and we do do disc in the United States.
And it does help a percentage of people

617
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:50,050
doesn't help everybody.
And like we were talking before about

618
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:53,950
not just not just the desk but the
muscles around the desk.

619
00:25:53,951 --> 00:25:55,900
So if you take somebody who's had an
injury,

620
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,220
um,
my partner,

621
00:25:57,221 --> 00:26:01,600
Dr Mckenna is a orthopedic surgeon and
he's been talking about this for years.

622
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:05,140
But if you take somebody with a disc
injury and you look at the muscles right

623
00:26:05,141 --> 00:26:08,710
on either side of the spine there and
you'll find that they're withered away

624
00:26:08,711 --> 00:26:10,920
or they're marbled with fat and that,
that sort of thing,

625
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:13,300
you take an elite athlete,
so it's super healthy,

626
00:26:13,301 --> 00:26:14,134
works out all the time.

627
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:15,670
Those muscles,
they're like,

628
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:18,130
they're like ropes.
That's a full light Manyana the human

629
00:26:18,131 --> 00:26:18,964
body,
right?

630
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:21,790
And you look at that and they're just
black on Mri,

631
00:26:21,791 --> 00:26:25,600
but you take somebody that's had a disc
injury at any level and you can look and

632
00:26:25,601 --> 00:26:28,660
there's marbling in there and it's
withered and that sort of thing.

633
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,190
So,
uh,

634
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:35,310
one of the things we do in South Lake in
Dallas is we inject the desk but also

635
00:26:35,771 --> 00:26:38,770
inject those muscles along the side.
And that's using your own bone marrow.

636
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:41,110
And that's still allowed in the United
States.

637
00:26:41,111 --> 00:26:45,660
So the bone marrow draw the concentrate,
the stem cells inject him in those

638
00:26:45,661 --> 00:26:45,950
areas.

639
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:47,060
Well,
that's something that we were talking

640
00:26:47,061 --> 00:26:50,030
about earlier when I showed you the
reverse hyper when I showed you that

641
00:26:50,031 --> 00:26:52,880
machine and then that,
that Dex back stretcher.

642
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:55,950
I think that's a significant part of the
injuries that you see with people with

643
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,770
discs,
with back injuries.

644
00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:59,630
They don't have strong backs right
there.

645
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,330
The tissue,
the muscle around the back that protects

646
00:27:02,331 --> 00:27:03,650
the spine.
It's just very weak.

647
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:04,640
Right,
right.

648
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,020
Yeah.
It's fantastic machine.

649
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:07,280
I'm going to get one.
Yeah,

650
00:27:07,281 --> 00:27:09,530
you got to get one or two mil.
Yeah,

651
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:12,110
I've got a crazy back dude.
That picture you showed me your back is

652
00:27:12,111 --> 00:27:13,360
fucking banana.
Yeah,

653
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:15,920
no,
it's like out of a nursery rhyme.

654
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:19,490
Hey,
is that what I had done down in Texas

655
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:23,330
with the bone marrow?
Mel Actually had that done yet in Texas.

656
00:27:23,331 --> 00:27:24,830
Yeah.
How many treatments have you had

657
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:27,290
while there was that one?

658
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:32,380
And then I had the shoulders twice and
then I just had him drop it into my

659
00:27:32,811 --> 00:27:33,644
vein,
you know,

660
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,260
just run around.
What's that like?

661
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,860
It's pretty cool.
I mean,

662
00:27:36,861 --> 00:27:40,760
you feel a little sleepy for a couple of
days and then you feel pretty energetic,

663
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,410
really sleepy.
Yeah.

664
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:44,900
It kind of,
I think it takes its toll on you.

665
00:27:44,901 --> 00:27:46,190
I mean,
um,

666
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:49,850
I don't know why you feel sleepy.
Neil may have an explanation for that,

667
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,480
but yeah,
well like two,

668
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:54,590
three days where the cells are good,
they kind of reeducate the immune

669
00:27:54,591 --> 00:27:55,250
system,
you know,

670
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:57,630
like a lot of what we treat our
rheumatory right.

671
00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:00,630
Artists and multiple sclerosis,
autoimmune diseases,

672
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:03,560
and there's a retraining that's going on
in the immune system.

673
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:05,780
And um,
so that,

674
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:09,140
that involves cytokines and those,
those molecules,

675
00:28:09,141 --> 00:28:11,360
those peptides are the things that make
you feel sick.

676
00:28:11,361 --> 00:28:12,560
I mean,
when you get the flu,

677
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:16,400
the flu virus doesn't make you sick.
It's your body's immune reaction to

678
00:28:16,401 --> 00:28:18,860
that.
That's the stuff that's being thrown off

679
00:28:18,861 --> 00:28:20,210
from the,
from the fight.

680
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:22,220
That's what actually makes you feel
sick.

681
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:25,200
And so when you're activating certain
things,

682
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,920
parts of the immune system and they're
throwing off things can make you a

683
00:28:27,921 --> 00:28:29,060
little bit tired.
Some people,

684
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:32,720
very small percentage have some flu like
symptoms for one day,

685
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,130
but those are,
that's kind of like the extent of the

686
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:39,000
side effects that we typically see.
But if you,

687
00:28:39,001 --> 00:28:43,130
if you look at like you ask why hasn't
been being done us,

688
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:44,600
um,
for,

689
00:28:44,601 --> 00:28:45,950
for rheumatic drugs.

690
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:47,660
So you,
you see them on TV,

691
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:51,530
um,
they're advertised basically every hour

692
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:55,670
of every day on almost every station and
you see these antirheumatics and you

693
00:28:55,671 --> 00:28:57,140
know,
if you have rheumatoid arthritis,

694
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:59,750
if you have psoriatic arthritis or this
sort of thing,

695
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,000
um,
these are biologics and these are

696
00:29:02,001 --> 00:29:05,060
antibodies to a certain molecule called
TNF.

697
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,340
TNF is one of the commanders of the
immune system.

698
00:29:07,341 --> 00:29:07,971
It kind of,
it says,

699
00:29:07,971 --> 00:29:09,170
Hey,
let's,

700
00:29:09,171 --> 00:29:11,600
let's cause a bunch of inflammation and
make you miserable.

701
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:13,460
And so the,
the,

702
00:29:13,461 --> 00:29:18,461
these drugs basically bind up or sop up
the TNF that's in your body for a period

703
00:29:19,161 --> 00:29:20,750
of time.
That's why you have to get retreated

704
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:22,340
like every month,
every six months,

705
00:29:22,341 --> 00:29:24,020
every two months.
Something like that,

706
00:29:24,021 --> 00:29:25,310
six weeks,
two months,

707
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:27,890
and you have to get retrained and
retreated.

708
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,770
Um,
there's a study of rheumatoid arthritis

709
00:29:30,771 --> 00:29:33,710
where they,
it was 172 people that were already on,

710
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:36,170
on medication for the rheumatoid
arthritis,

711
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:37,850
not adequately controlled.

712
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:41,860
They gave him like the equivalent of
what a typical we give him.

713
00:29:41,861 --> 00:29:46,000
Panama is like roughly 120 million cells
and all of them got better.

714
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:48,640
All of them symptomatically improved.
And,

715
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:53,380
and the cool thing was that that tnf
Alpha and another molecule similar,

716
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:57,480
similar to it,
decreased by 50% and that decreased

717
00:29:57,481 --> 00:29:59,950
persisted for eight and a half months
that was linked to the study.

718
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:05,220
So rather than putting an antibody in
two to sop up what's being produced,

719
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:10,000
apparently by your immune system,
you,

720
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:13,300
the cells tell your immune system to
stop it,

721
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:14,470
right.
The cells,

722
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:19,090
they up a certain immune cell called the
t regulatory cell that says to the

723
00:30:19,091 --> 00:30:19,924
immune system,
hey,

724
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:23,100
quit making tnf alpha.
Queet quit making this [inaudible]

725
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:25,300
stuff.
And they took 30 patients,

726
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,780
a sub cohort like three months later and
gave him another shot,

727
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:31,600
the same dose and it dropped their
levels,

728
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:34,810
another 50% from that baseline.
So from,

729
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:39,070
from baseline to post second treatment,
two treatments to ib,

730
00:30:39,071 --> 00:30:40,930
sitting in a chair,
uh,

731
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,790
dropped their levels,
75%.

732
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:46,420
It just seems like something that would
be amazing for overall repair.

733
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:51,110
Like just go down there and let your
body just get a little dose of healing

734
00:30:51,111 --> 00:30:53,260
to figure out what the fuck is wrong
with them.

735
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:58,040
We'll talk about like we talked about
something and Costa Rica,

736
00:30:58,041 --> 00:31:01,130
we were both there and um,
I had uh,

737
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:02,300
uh,
you know,

738
00:31:02,301 --> 00:31:05,030
they looked at my neck,
I had a 50% occlusion in the right

739
00:31:05,031 --> 00:31:06,170
carotid,
you know,

740
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:08,360
like build up of stuff.
Like,

741
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:10,400
like you don't feel it happening all of
a sudden,

742
00:31:10,401 --> 00:31:12,910
you know,
all of a sudden when your carotids is

743
00:31:12,911 --> 00:31:13,790
shut down,
they think,

744
00:31:13,791 --> 00:31:15,590
well,
you have to eat the statens,

745
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:16,520
right?
Yeah.

746
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,780
Like crystal or lipitor and you know,
I looked at what the side effects of

747
00:31:20,781 --> 00:31:22,010
those things are.
Yeah.

748
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:24,380
And I said,
I'd rather die than eat those things.

749
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,401
And they said,
well,

750
00:31:25,401 --> 00:31:26,930
you,
and they try and make you feel guilty

751
00:31:26,931 --> 00:31:28,220
for not doing it.
You got kids,

752
00:31:28,221 --> 00:31:28,821
you got,
you know,

753
00:31:28,821 --> 00:31:29,654
like,
eh,

754
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:31,430
but it's a,
um,

755
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:36,350
uh,
I don't have that stuff now and I didn't

756
00:31:36,351 --> 00:31:40,700
get anyone to go in and remove it.
And I don't know if I can attribute that

757
00:31:40,701 --> 00:31:44,210
to the cells,
but I got a bunch of cells like twice

758
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:48,470
and that went away.
Now I talk about that for a minute.

759
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,820
Does that sort of a,

760
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:50,861
yeah.
Well,

761
00:31:50,861 --> 00:31:52,050
just in,
in general,

762
00:31:52,051 --> 00:31:54,240
your,
your body,

763
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:58,680
you have a certain number of these cells
when you're born and they age just like

764
00:31:58,681 --> 00:32:01,660
the rest of your body.
And they,

765
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:05,220
they,
they perform more poorly as you age,

766
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:07,710
right?
So if you take one of these cells from a

767
00:32:07,711 --> 00:32:09,150
newborn,
like when you were born,

768
00:32:09,151 --> 00:32:11,760
you could pluck one of these cells out,
throw it in a petri dish and let it

769
00:32:11,761 --> 00:32:13,830
grow.
You let it grow for a month.

770
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:17,760
It divides roughly every 24 hours or
that's the doubling rate.

771
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:22,530
So at the end of a month you have a
billion cells and then at at,

772
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:25,470
if you take from a 35 year old and do
the same thing,

773
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,080
it's doubling times like two days
instead of one day.

774
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:32,610
And at the end of the month you have
32,000 cells and you take them from a 65

775
00:32:32,611 --> 00:32:36,900
year old who's relatively healthy and
they divide every 60 hours.

776
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,880
You get 200 cells at the end of the
month.

777
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:43,700
So if your problem is a thousand cells
or it's 20,000 cells or if it's a

778
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:46,700
million cells,
you can't get it done at past a certain

779
00:32:46,701 --> 00:32:48,140
age.
Just because it sells don't have the

780
00:32:48,141 --> 00:32:51,080
regenerative capacity.
And the good thing about the umbilical

781
00:32:51,081 --> 00:32:55,400
cord cells is they,
if you co culture them with these older

782
00:32:55,401 --> 00:32:58,430
people cells with the young cells,
they don't even have to touch each

783
00:32:58,431 --> 00:33:00,470
other.
Just the secretions of the young cells

784
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:04,400
will make the young,
the old cells start dividing faster and

785
00:33:04,401 --> 00:33:07,430
behaving younger and the Mitochondria to
see pictures.

786
00:33:07,431 --> 00:33:12,431
And in my book you can see a picture of
of cells from a 65 year old diabetic and

787
00:33:13,761 --> 00:33:16,640
without any,
without any juice on them.

788
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:20,570
And then you put the juice from the
young cells on there and they look like

789
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,990
18 year old mscs with,
with the functional Mitochondria,

790
00:33:23,991 --> 00:33:26,720
Mitochondria all throughout the cell
body rather than all bunched up.

791
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:28,480
They have,
they look health.

792
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:30,290
They just,
I mean as a cell biologist,

793
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:33,640
I know what looks healthy and anybody
else would you,

794
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:37,400
you can see just from the picture how
vastly different it is just to be

795
00:33:37,401 --> 00:33:39,800
exposed to the,
to the juice.

796
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:40,761
You know,
you,

797
00:33:40,761 --> 00:33:43,940
you said heard of this pair of biosis
study they did at Harvard where they

798
00:33:43,941 --> 00:33:47,100
took young minds and young minds and
they,

799
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,630
and they sewed them together with old
mice and then the old mice actually got

800
00:33:50,631 --> 00:33:55,631
younger and use the blood of the young
mice and put it in the old mice.

801
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:59,990
Well they literally sewed them together
so their bodies together so their bodies

802
00:33:59,991 --> 00:34:01,850
together and so their bloodstreams
together.

803
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:05,060
Oh Geez.
That the bloodstream is mixing and so

804
00:34:05,061 --> 00:34:07,610
that the young Frankenstein Shit.
Yes,

805
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,470
Pretty Frankie.
But they,

806
00:34:09,471 --> 00:34:10,670
uh,
so at the end,

807
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:12,350
at the end of the study,
they showed that,

808
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:13,440
um,
that,

809
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:15,290
that the older,
the older mice got,

810
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:19,160
their neurologic system got better,
the cardiovascular system got better,

811
00:34:19,161 --> 00:34:21,140
skeletal muscle got better,
everything got better.

812
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:24,440
And,
and one of the key molecules in there,

813
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:28,730
um,
is called GDF 11 and GDF 11 is if we,

814
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:32,270
when we look at the secret home,
that's what the cells secrete when

815
00:34:32,271 --> 00:34:34,970
they're growing.
And we pull that out and we quantify it

816
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,600
in the top four every time as GDF 11
from the golden cells.

817
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:41,240
So the golden cells or,
or producing GDF 11,

818
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:44,840
which is one of the key molecules for
stimulating regeneration in your body.

819
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:49,520
So what other auto immune diseases do
you think could be assisted by this?

820
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:51,190
Well,
um,

821
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:52,540
we,
we,

822
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:55,610
we do a lot of Ms. Um,
that's probably our number one

823
00:34:55,611 --> 00:34:57,590
indication.
We just finished a clinical trial,

824
00:34:57,830 --> 00:35:00,350
prospective clinical trial we submitted
for publication.

825
00:35:00,351 --> 00:35:03,020
It should be,
it should be coming out in the next

826
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,070
month or so.
Um,

827
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:05,293
and,
and,

828
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:08,630
and statistically,
significantly the,

829
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:11,030
they,
these patients improved dramatically.

830
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:14,620
And as far as side effect profile is,
it was highly minimal and me feel

831
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:16,920
headaches and phew,
phew,

832
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:18,280
flu like symptoms,
things like that.

833
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:21,560
But this was what 20 people and one of
the,

834
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:26,360
one of the individuals actually is
clinically is perfect and all of his

835
00:35:26,361 --> 00:35:29,390
legions went away and we only did one
treatment with these.

836
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:32,690
Typically with Ms,
it's more refractory then rheumatory

837
00:35:32,691 --> 00:35:34,550
arthritis,
rheumatoid arthritis.

838
00:35:34,551 --> 00:35:39,260
Usually after one treatment people get a
ton of benefit with Ms. They usually see

839
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,580
after two or three treatments that they,
they really,

840
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:44,490
they see the most benefit.
And we only did one treatment in this,

841
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:46,110
in this trial,
but one,

842
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:48,030
one gentleman had three lesions in his
brain.

843
00:35:48,031 --> 00:35:49,710
All three legions completely
disappeared.

844
00:35:49,711 --> 00:35:50,600
So,
um,

845
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:54,900
ms is a big thing.
Rheumatory arthritis is a big thing and

846
00:35:54,901 --> 00:35:57,750
I could tell you their stories in the,
not stories,

847
00:35:57,751 --> 00:36:01,940
but you know,
people talking about their responses and

848
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:03,540
it's pretty incredible.
There's one lady that,

849
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:07,380
um,
her husband was a physics phd physicist.

850
00:36:07,381 --> 00:36:10,680
He carried on working just so she could
afford,

851
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:13,680
just so she could have insurance to
afford the medications,

852
00:36:13,681 --> 00:36:16,800
which are around a hundred grand a year
for her to get treated for rheumatoid

853
00:36:16,801 --> 00:36:17,634
arthritis.

854
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:19,890
And she came down about,
it'll be,

855
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,770
it's a little over three years ago,
November.

856
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:26,190
And she hasn't been on any medications
since.

857
00:36:26,191 --> 00:36:29,940
She actually started walking around the
mall when she was in Panama.

858
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,130
And then when she got home,
she's completely pain free and she,

859
00:36:33,131 --> 00:36:36,480
she'd been pain free for three years and
her husband finally retired because he

860
00:36:36,481 --> 00:36:37,770
didn't care about,
you know,

861
00:36:37,771 --> 00:36:41,010
having the insurance to pay for these
very expensive drugs that she was taken.

862
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,320
So,
Ms Rheumatoid Arthritis,

863
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,940
Lupus,
um,

864
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,980
we don't,
we don't have a lupus protocol.

865
00:36:46,981 --> 00:36:47,790
There's,
there's a,

866
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:51,420
a group in China that's,
that's published six really good papers

867
00:36:51,421 --> 00:36:55,170
on Lupus and it's very,
very effective in their trials.

868
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:57,150
We haven't done that yet.
Um,

869
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:58,950
and,
and then autism,

870
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:01,800
it's not considered an autoimmune
disease,

871
00:37:01,801 --> 00:37:02,970
but,
um,

872
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:03,930
we,
we have a trial.

873
00:37:03,931 --> 00:37:08,040
We just completed our autism trial with
33 33,

874
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:09,210
uh,
enrollees,

875
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,490
uh,
with very good results.

876
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:12,330
Uh,
many,

877
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:15,210
many of those kids became not autistic
after treatment.

878
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,820
Um,
confusing to me because you talked about

879
00:37:17,821 --> 00:37:19,360
people that are young,
right?

880
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,350
So why,
why would it have such a benefit,

881
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:23,610
benefit for them?
Well,

882
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:26,790
um,
I wrote an article in 2007 about why

883
00:37:26,791 --> 00:37:28,820
these cells should be good for autism
and,

884
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:29,360
and,
and,

885
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,920
and basically it,
um,

886
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:34,080
it's,
and it's the most downloaded article

887
00:37:34,081 --> 00:37:37,680
this journal's ever had.
Something like 75,000 people have

888
00:37:37,681 --> 00:37:41,430
downloaded a scientific journal article,
which really doesn't happen very often.

889
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:44,160
Um,
but kids,

890
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:49,920
people with autism have inflammatory
things going on in their body a lot of

891
00:37:49,921 --> 00:37:51,540
times in the gut.
Um,

892
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:52,740
there are in the,
in the,

893
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:55,170
in the,
at the end of the small intestine,

894
00:37:55,171 --> 00:37:59,490
there are these inflammatory nodules
that look a lot like Crohn's disease and

895
00:37:59,491 --> 00:38:01,920
they secrete these,
this inflammation,

896
00:38:01,921 --> 00:38:04,440
the thing goes to the brain and planes,
the white matter of the brain,

897
00:38:04,441 --> 00:38:07,710
the white matter of brain swells,
decreases the blood flow to the brain.

898
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:09,660
All of that's,
you know,

899
00:38:09,661 --> 00:38:12,420
intertwined.
And then just a few years ago,

900
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:14,580
there was this study that came out and
this is what,

901
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:18,060
this is what allowed us to go forward
with our clinical trial.

902
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:20,520
Um,
they found that there the two

903
00:38:20,521 --> 00:38:25,140
inflammatory molecules that are MDC and
torque and they're perfectly correlate

904
00:38:25,141 --> 00:38:30,141
with the severity of symptoms of autism.
And so we measured not only those two

905
00:38:30,901 --> 00:38:34,080
but another 30 some biomarkers we
measure.

906
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:39,100
We did quantitative eeg is we did a lot
of standardized scoring store a scoring

907
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:42,490
with a neurologist that,
that read them,

908
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:44,590
you know,
before treatment,

909
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,360
during treatment,
after treatment.

910
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:48,350
Uh,
so I,

911
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:51,160
I believe a lot of the problems with
autism,

912
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:56,220
half stem from the inflammatory status
and these cells are definitely anti

913
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:57,940
inflammatory.
Yeah.

914
00:38:57,941 --> 00:38:59,330
They've had some benefit,
uh,

915
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:04,350
with changing the Diet and changing the
gut biome of kids with autism and

916
00:39:04,391 --> 00:39:08,530
they've made some benefits of that and
which they believe is also connected to

917
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,393
inflammation.

918
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:10,451
Yeah,
absolutely.

919
00:39:10,451 --> 00:39:12,100
If your,
if your immune system's freaking out,

920
00:39:12,101 --> 00:39:14,570
every time you eat a piece of bread,
uh,

921
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,270
and that,
and that immune system is thrown out

922
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:19,240
molecules that are swollen your brain
and inflaming your brain,

923
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:20,950
then it makes complete sense.
And Yeah.

924
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:26,410
You know,
I think in general that the people with

925
00:39:26,681 --> 00:39:29,980
autism that do the best are the ones
that get that addressed before they come

926
00:39:29,981 --> 00:39:31,360
down.
Um,

927
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:33,580
you know,
there's some other doctors that do

928
00:39:33,581 --> 00:39:35,560
functional medicine and they look at
their diet,

929
00:39:35,561 --> 00:39:37,240
they look at,
see if they have any heavy metals and

930
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:40,570
that sort of thing.
And the ones that just are slam dunk,

931
00:39:40,571 --> 00:39:42,910
do the best.
I've been cleaned up before they come

932
00:39:42,911 --> 00:39:44,070
down.
Well,

933
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,210
so what about heart disease?
You were saying you were talking about

934
00:39:46,211 --> 00:39:48,640
people that have heart issues.
Yeah.

935
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:50,530
Uh,
we have a number of patients with heart

936
00:39:50,531 --> 00:39:52,450
failure that have responded quite well.

937
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:53,710
Failure,
heart failure,

938
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:55,900
heart attack,
need of a transplant,

939
00:39:55,901 --> 00:39:56,920
that kind of thing.
Yeah.

940
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:59,200
Yeah.
On transplant lists and that sort of

941
00:39:59,201 --> 00:40:00,034
thing.
Yeah.

942
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:02,590
I have a friend who's on a transplant
list.

943
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,580
Yeah.
Right.

944
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,820
So,
um,

945
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:07,390
there are different kinds of heart
failure and um,

946
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:08,890
so,
but uh,

947
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,610
the other thing interesting about heart
failure's a cells don't need to go to

948
00:40:12,611 --> 00:40:16,870
the heart and to actually become new
heart cells and that sort of thing.

949
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,330
It's actually the secretions of the
cells.

950
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:20,740
Like I said before,
there was,

951
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:22,900
there was a study at University of
Buffalo where they took,

952
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:26,710
they injected cells ivy in a,
in a hamster model of heart failure.

953
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:28,750
And,
and then they looked in the,

954
00:40:28,751 --> 00:40:30,430
in the heart and there were very few
cells,

955
00:40:30,431 --> 00:40:32,550
but the heart failure got better.
And then they said,

956
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,393
oh,
let's inject,

957
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:37,150
let's inject those same cells.
These are MSC umbilical mncs inject them

958
00:40:37,151 --> 00:40:39,310
into the,
into the hamstring muscle.

959
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:42,730
And they demonstrated that none of the
cells came out of the hamstring muscle

960
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:47,350
and yet the heart failure app better.
So then they took just the juice,

961
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:50,260
the liquid that the cells secrete and
they start,

962
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:53,590
stay simulated.
The amount of juice that the cells would

963
00:40:53,591 --> 00:40:56,230
have produced in the body and just
injected the Jews and the heart failure

964
00:40:56,231 --> 00:40:59,800
at better.
So it's really the secretions of the

965
00:40:59,801 --> 00:41:03,760
cells stimulating the natural repair,
augmenting the natural repair process of

966
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:06,940
the body that has been stretched to its
limit.

967
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:08,800
You know,
if you have a 65 year old,

968
00:41:08,801 --> 00:41:10,870
those cells aren't dividing very well.
This,

969
00:41:10,871 --> 00:41:14,860
the Jews can help the cells divide
faster and produce more repair molecules

970
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:15,550
and,
and,

971
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:17,740
and make it better.
So do you think that it could take

972
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:21,760
someone who's on a heart transplant list
and literally fix their heart?

973
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:23,590
I've seen it happen time and again.

974
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:25,090
Wow.
And there,

975
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:25,691
there,
there,

976
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:29,950
there are clinical trials using similar
cell types that also have demonstrated

977
00:41:29,951 --> 00:41:30,311
that,
you know,

978
00:41:30,311 --> 00:41:32,020
there's a,
there's a molecule called BMP,

979
00:41:32,021 --> 00:41:35,570
which is high and heart failure.
The BNP came down in every single case,

980
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:37,460
uh,
the injection ejection fraction,

981
00:41:37,461 --> 00:41:39,380
which measures kind of like the
efficiency,

982
00:41:39,381 --> 00:41:41,840
how much,
how much blood you're heart's pumping on

983
00:41:41,841 --> 00:41:43,070
each stroke.
Uh,

984
00:41:43,071 --> 00:41:44,600
went up.
And every single patient,

985
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:47,000
you know,
I think are in the book.

986
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:49,130
The,
the craziest case was a,

987
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:51,370
was a Gringo who was down in Costa Rica
and,

988
00:41:51,371 --> 00:41:52,430
and,
and he,

989
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:54,500
he,
he was our,

990
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,820
I don't know,
he was probably 20,

991
00:41:55,821 --> 00:41:59,600
25% routinely,
but he got a viral disease or something

992
00:41:59,601 --> 00:42:02,840
else and he was 11% ejection fraction,
normals about 60.

993
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,530
And uh,
they,

994
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:05,630
the,
the regular,

995
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:09,530
the regular hospital who worked a lot
with us using with our spinal cord

996
00:42:09,531 --> 00:42:12,590
patients and seeing results,
seeing people walking again,

997
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:14,600
um,
they,

998
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:17,900
they just said,
you can't get on a plane.

999
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:20,510
You're at 3,700 feet.
If you get on a plane,

1000
00:42:20,511 --> 00:42:22,970
you'll be dead.
You might as well go see these guys over

1001
00:42:22,971 --> 00:42:25,130
at stem cell place and see if anything
had happened.

1002
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:26,930
And I think his case is in the book as
well.

1003
00:42:26,931 --> 00:42:28,090
But he went from,
I dunno,

1004
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:31,610
11 to 42 or something like that.
Um,

1005
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:34,970
that he wasn't the first case.
The first case was a doctor who's a

1006
00:42:34,971 --> 00:42:37,970
friend of George's friend,
doctor pause or medical director,

1007
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:40,610
um,
who had congenital.

1008
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:43,340
So his,
his mother had died of heart failure.

1009
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:48,290
His sister had died,
his brother had died and he was,

1010
00:42:48,291 --> 00:42:50,870
you know,
not even 50 years old and his ejection

1011
00:42:50,871 --> 00:42:55,871
fraction was hovering around 30%.
And a lot of people at,

1012
00:42:57,110 --> 00:42:58,610
you know,
at an advanced age,

1013
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:00,500
you're not even going to get on the
list.

1014
00:43:00,501 --> 00:43:01,490
Cause if you,
if you're a,

1015
00:43:01,510 --> 00:43:04,580
if you're a 50 or 60 year old and
there's a 20 year old ahead of Ya,

1016
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:05,900
20 year old's going to win.

1017
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:08,540
And so he begged and begged to come
down.

1018
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:11,090
He was our first patient and we didn't
even really want to take him because we

1019
00:43:11,091 --> 00:43:13,220
didn't know what was gonna happen cause
nobody had ever done it.

1020
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:16,030
And we treated him and he went back.
Um,

1021
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:19,050
and he had his,
he had an ejection fraction,

1022
00:43:19,051 --> 00:43:23,060
you know,
the echocardiogram and it was 52% and

1023
00:43:23,061 --> 00:43:25,030
then the doctor didn't believe it.
So he did read it.

1024
00:43:25,031 --> 00:43:27,950
It a month later it was 55%.
So,

1025
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:28,970
um,
I,

1026
00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:29,823
you know,
it's not,

1027
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:34,370
I don't think it's for every case and we
have people with like a super bad heart

1028
00:43:34,371 --> 00:43:37,340
attack and there's not enough to repair
and you really need a heart transplant.

1029
00:43:37,341 --> 00:43:40,070
But I think,
I think you're going to see that it's

1030
00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:44,330
ultimately I think in 20 years are
probably going to see standard of care

1031
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:49,070
for diseases,
chronic diseases like any chronic

1032
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:52,460
degenerative disease for which there's
no good treatment.

1033
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:55,430
You're going to see standard of care is
going to be young,

1034
00:43:55,431 --> 00:43:59,650
healthy mesenchymal stem cells.
Because if you look at the root cause

1035
00:43:59,651 --> 00:44:02,390
here I get a question a lot.
How was it?

1036
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:04,400
How is it these things worked for so
many things.

1037
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:08,480
Well when the root cause is a lack of or
dysfunction of those cells,

1038
00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:13,250
then it makes sense that replenishing
those are re restoring them with young

1039
00:44:13,251 --> 00:44:15,800
healthy wounds could be a useful
treatment.

1040
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:17,630
Well Mel,
this is so important to you that you

1041
00:44:17,631 --> 00:44:20,210
wanted to come on and talk about this.
He wanted to let people know about this

1042
00:44:20,211 --> 00:44:20,990
shit.
Yeah,

1043
00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:22,130
I think it's amazing.
And,

1044
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,140
and it seems a crime to me that,
you know,

1045
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:27,470
it isn't easier to do in this country
where,

1046
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:28,220
you know,
we're,

1047
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:29,480
we're an advanced country.
I mean,

1048
00:44:29,481 --> 00:44:31,980
they should look a little harder at it
and it's a

1049
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:34,140
mystery to me why it isn't the case.
But,

1050
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:35,040
you know,
hey,

1051
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,500
uh,
if there are places where one can go and

1052
00:44:37,501 --> 00:44:39,150
get some help,
it's good.

1053
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:41,010
I mean,
I know another Gal,

1054
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:44,280
she's a good friend of mine,
she tour a shoulders up because she was

1055
00:44:44,281 --> 00:44:46,630
like an athlete and,
uh,

1056
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:50,040
she had her shoulders down and she got
some dropped into her and it actually,

1057
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:54,090
uh,
helped greatly with an autoimmune

1058
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:57,390
disorder that she had.
And then she was able to have kids.

1059
00:44:58,590 --> 00:45:00,540
It was that kind of thing,
you know?

1060
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:01,420
Yeah.
There,

1061
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:04,060
there,
there's some really good animal data

1062
00:45:04,061 --> 00:45:08,800
showing that you can inject these cells
and you can take ovarian failure and

1063
00:45:08,801 --> 00:45:10,690
reverse it.
And in her case,

1064
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:11,583
she,
uh,

1065
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:16,420
she had an autoimmune disease and she
was unable to have children told that

1066
00:45:16,421 --> 00:45:17,320
from the very young age.

1067
00:45:17,410 --> 00:45:18,243
And,
um,

1068
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:21,610
after treatment she got pregnant pretty
quickly.

1069
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:24,850
This sounds almost too good to be true.
This is almost like be skeptical.

1070
00:45:24,851 --> 00:45:26,070
People that are listening to this right
now.

1071
00:45:26,071 --> 00:45:28,360
I'll probably be like,
why this fucking shit cures everything.

1072
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:31,150
It sounds like the old spruik around the
corner.

1073
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:33,990
Good for moles,
holes and pimples on ones.

1074
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:37,900
But you've got studies.
You mean you've got real trials to back

1075
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:41,200
this up and you've got a host of
patients that are healed up and,

1076
00:45:41,201 --> 00:45:42,220
and,
and healthy.

1077
00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:43,480
Uh,
yeah,

1078
00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:44,910
yeah,
totally sound.

1079
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:47,090
Take nothing wrong with me.
I want to go down there and shut up.

1080
00:45:48,070 --> 00:45:52,270
You see a 92 year old man who is about
ready to kick the bucket and he's almost

1081
00:45:52,271 --> 00:45:55,090
a hundred.
He's going to celebrate 100 years in

1082
00:45:55,091 --> 00:45:55,930
August.
So,

1083
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:57,220
and it's incredible.
He's,

1084
00:45:57,221 --> 00:45:59,110
he's better off than he was.
Let me tell you.

1085
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:01,460
Yeah.
This young guy with,

1086
00:46:01,461 --> 00:46:02,550
uh,
the shins,

1087
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:03,770
muscular dystrophy,
you know this,

1088
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:06,510
the cells don't last forever.
This is also an important point.

1089
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:07,800
Uh,
with the shins,

1090
00:46:07,801 --> 00:46:08,700
it's,
it's a,

1091
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:12,000
it's a genetic defect.
So they're missing a protein and these

1092
00:46:12,001 --> 00:46:14,100
cells go in this,
in animal models,

1093
00:46:14,101 --> 00:46:16,170
he sells,
you give them to the animal.

1094
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:20,430
They go into the muscle and then they,
they start secreting that molecule that

1095
00:46:20,431 --> 00:46:22,550
they're missing but they only last for
about four or five,

1096
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,210
six months.
And then they,

1097
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:26,790
then they start maturing and then the
immune system clears them.

1098
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:30,030
It's a real important point.
You don't have that with embryonic stem

1099
00:46:30,031 --> 00:46:32,730
cells because they cause tumors and
things like that.

1100
00:46:32,731 --> 00:46:36,330
And the great thing about these cells,
they don't cause tumors because they

1101
00:46:36,331 --> 00:46:38,610
differentiate.
They don't want to be a baby.

1102
00:46:38,810 --> 00:46:42,360
They are just there to do their job,
which is to keep homeostasis,

1103
00:46:42,361 --> 00:46:44,910
keep,
keep the immune system controlled.

1104
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:47,220
Can you know,
help with regeneration,

1105
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:48,083
all that sort of thing.

1106
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:51,180
But the embryonic stuff,
cause I find this interesting,

1107
00:46:51,181 --> 00:46:53,880
the embryonic step is full of weird
anomalies and stuff.

1108
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:55,750
Yeah.
We wrote,

1109
00:46:56,450 --> 00:47:00,260
a few of us got together and wrote an
article when they finally put the clamp

1110
00:47:00,261 --> 00:47:03,800
on the last embryonic stem cell
treatment and we'd been saying for years

1111
00:47:03,801 --> 00:47:06,800
that embryonic stem cells aren't going
to work because they want to become

1112
00:47:06,801 --> 00:47:08,570
babies.
Their number one problem is they want to

1113
00:47:08,571 --> 00:47:11,720
become babies.
They don't want to these cells,

1114
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:14,150
the cells that we start with,
they don't want to become babies.

1115
00:47:14,151 --> 00:47:15,260
The babies are already born.
These are,

1116
00:47:15,261 --> 00:47:17,320
they're mature,
they're Mesenchymal,

1117
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:19,300
and,
and that's what they are and that

1118
00:47:19,430 --> 00:47:21,650
they're never going to be anything else.
Um,

1119
00:47:21,710 --> 00:47:23,690
whereas the embryonic stem cells,
um,

1120
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:25,970
the biggest problem with them is they
always form tumors.

1121
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,730
They form teratomas.
And so in order for them to be

1122
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:30,820
functional,
you have to grow them out.

1123
00:47:30,821 --> 00:47:33,460
And if you want them to have MSC,
like qualities,

1124
00:47:33,461 --> 00:47:35,530
you have to force them to become mscs.

1125
00:47:35,950 --> 00:47:39,670
And then you have to make darn sure that
there aren't any,

1126
00:47:39,850 --> 00:47:42,340
if I only takes one,
if there's one left,

1127
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:46,840
then it's going to form a tumor.
So that was the big problem that the

1128
00:47:46,841 --> 00:47:47,950
expense,
and it was three,

1129
00:47:47,951 --> 00:47:51,190
$400,000 a dose just to make sure that
they didn't have one in them.

1130
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:54,880
And then they weren't as beneficial.
And they'd been monkeyed with in the lab

1131
00:47:54,910 --> 00:47:59,080
from when they were embryonic and then
converted and converted and converted

1132
00:47:59,081 --> 00:48:01,720
and converted and then grown up in huge
numbers.

1133
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:04,810
And so they were monkeyed with these
cells.

1134
00:48:04,811 --> 00:48:06,760
You don't have to monkey with it.
And they just do it naturally.

1135
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:09,670
You just take them out,
you digest them,

1136
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:11,770
you put,
you put them in a nutrient broth and the

1137
00:48:11,771 --> 00:48:15,250
right temperature and humidity and
oxygen levels,

1138
00:48:15,251 --> 00:48:16,990
and they just grow.
And so,

1139
00:48:17,290 --> 00:48:19,060
um,
the,

1140
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:20,010
you know,
the,

1141
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:22,060
we wrote an article about embryonic stem
cells.

1142
00:48:22,090 --> 00:48:26,140
We call it the king is the king is dead
long live the king because,

1143
00:48:26,290 --> 00:48:26,830
you know,
the,

1144
00:48:26,830 --> 00:48:31,830
the California,
the California voters kneejerk $3

1145
00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:34,060
billion towards an embryonic stem cell
work,

1146
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:35,201
uh,
you know,

1147
00:48:35,201 --> 00:48:39,730
against the Bush administration's
restriction of spending money on

1148
00:48:39,731 --> 00:48:42,670
embryonic stem cell research,
it wasn't banned,

1149
00:48:42,671 --> 00:48:45,010
as most people said.
All they said was,

1150
00:48:45,011 --> 00:48:49,180
we're not going to use taxpayer money,
federal taxpayer money to go towards

1151
00:48:49,181 --> 00:48:51,610
that.
And what people heard was they don't

1152
00:48:51,611 --> 00:48:53,080
want,
they don't want progress.

1153
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,040
Well,
what's happened is they,

1154
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:57,490
at last count,
I think they spent,

1155
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:58,780
you know,
two,

1156
00:48:58,781 --> 00:49:02,230
two and three quarter billion dollars.
They've got $250 million left.

1157
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:05,560
And guess what they're studying now,
adult stem cells,

1158
00:49:05,770 --> 00:49:07,780
they're studying umbilical cord stem
cells.

1159
00:49:07,790 --> 00:49:12,160
They're studying Mesenchymal stem cells,
they've completely cut out everything on

1160
00:49:12,161 --> 00:49:14,920
the embryonic side because it just took
that long.

1161
00:49:14,921 --> 00:49:17,740
There was so much misinformation out
there.

1162
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,570
Um,
and,

1163
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:24,250
and now thank God it's gone and,
and we regain our sanity,

1164
00:49:24,251 --> 00:49:26,860
but we blew it.
We blew a lot of dough on a,

1165
00:49:26,861 --> 00:49:28,090
on the whole embryonic thing.
Yeah.

1166
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:32,530
It was a lot of money.
And we paid as taxpayers in California

1167
00:49:32,531 --> 00:49:33,430
for that,
you know,

1168
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:38,350
cause people were misinformed.
So if a person's listening to you right

1169
00:49:38,351 --> 00:49:41,770
now and they've got some issues,
what's the first step they should take?

1170
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:43,790
Well,
um,

1171
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:48,340
I say guys got a blown knee and is
thinking about getting surgery.

1172
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:50,530
Yeah.
Well they could go in,

1173
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:52,690
our website is sell medicines,
cll,

1174
00:49:52,691 --> 00:49:55,450
medicine.com for Panama.
If you know,

1175
00:49:55,451 --> 00:49:57,370
if there's,
if it's something that can be addressed

1176
00:49:57,371 --> 00:50:00,130
with bone marrow in the u s RMI
clinic.com.

1177
00:50:00,131 --> 00:50:00,980
That's our,
uh,

1178
00:50:01,270 --> 00:50:03,730
the bone marrow's just not as effective.
Well,

1179
00:50:03,990 --> 00:50:05,140
it,
it can be.

1180
00:50:05,310 --> 00:50:05,910
It,
it's,

1181
00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:09,430
it's hard to say because everybody's
bone marrow is different.

1182
00:50:09,430 --> 00:50:10,810
Your age is different.
You know,

1183
00:50:10,811 --> 00:50:14,650
if you're 85 years old,
even if you're 65 years old and you're a

1184
00:50:14,651 --> 00:50:18,490
smoker or you're diabetic,
I don't think it's worth typically using

1185
00:50:18,491 --> 00:50:20,560
your bone marrow because it's just not
going to do a lot.

1186
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:21,940
Uh,
but younger,

1187
00:50:22,030 --> 00:50:23,830
younger people,
healthier people,

1188
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:25,330
a lot of times you can,
you know,

1189
00:50:25,331 --> 00:50:28,760
when it's in a joint,
because that's the only thing we can do

1190
00:50:28,761 --> 00:50:30,460
in the u s is orthopedics,
so.

1191
00:50:30,490 --> 00:50:33,230
Right.
But if it's an orthopedic problem,

1192
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:34,760
then you know,
they could check out,

1193
00:50:34,761 --> 00:50:35,780
see it,
see if they could,

1194
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:37,610
you know,
we could do something for him in Dallas.

1195
00:50:37,930 --> 00:50:42,230
If it's not orthopedic and you need
systemic treatment for autoimmune

1196
00:50:42,231 --> 00:50:44,210
disease.
If you have a spinal cord injury,

1197
00:50:44,430 --> 00:50:46,010
uh,
or autism,

1198
00:50:46,011 --> 00:50:48,230
any of those conditions,
then they go to sell medicine,

1199
00:50:48,231 --> 00:50:50,960
cll,
medicine.com and that's where we have,

1200
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:53,300
um,
there's all the information there and

1201
00:50:53,301 --> 00:50:55,950
they can fill out an application and
doctors get back with them and getting

1202
00:50:55,951 --> 00:50:56,750
in the system.

1203
00:50:56,750 --> 00:50:59,240
Now,
how difficult is it to go down to Panama

1204
00:50:59,241 --> 00:51:00,860
and get treatment?
Like how do you schedule that?

1205
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:02,420
Well,
that's,

1206
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:04,640
that's all taken care of.
There's a whole team of people that do

1207
00:51:04,641 --> 00:51:05,630
that.
Um,

1208
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:07,940
the only thing is you need a passport
and uh,

1209
00:51:07,970 --> 00:51:11,160
there's no visa required anything like,
uh,

1210
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:14,040
from la it's six hours way Far East.
So it's like,

1211
00:51:14,230 --> 00:51:15,920
it's like going to Miami.
It's like two hours.

1212
00:51:15,950 --> 00:51:18,530
Yeah.
It's actually two little over two hours

1213
00:51:18,531 --> 00:51:19,800
from Miami.
Uh,

1214
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:22,970
so cause it's cause it's waste,
it's almost due south of Atlanta.

1215
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:24,950
It's closer to New York,
right?

1216
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:26,290
Yeah.
It's five,

1217
00:51:26,290 --> 00:51:27,123
five,
five,

1218
00:51:27,270 --> 00:51:27,891
four,
four and a half,

1219
00:51:27,891 --> 00:51:29,540
five New York,
probably something like that.

1220
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:33,660
So sell medicine.com they go there,
contact you.

1221
00:51:33,661 --> 00:51:35,220
Now,
do they need to have some sort of a

1222
00:51:35,221 --> 00:51:38,670
consultation with a local doctor or an
MRI or anything like that before they go

1223
00:51:38,671 --> 00:51:39,080
to see you?

1224
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:41,480
Oh yeah.
There they need to have a diagnosis from

1225
00:51:41,481 --> 00:51:44,660
a physician for what they have.
And then you know that we have a team of

1226
00:51:44,661 --> 00:51:46,970
doctors there and they'll talk to them
and see what they need.

1227
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:49,220
If they need any other information than
any other,

1228
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:51,880
you know,
x rays or MRI's or whatever that

1229
00:51:51,950 --> 00:51:53,360
they'll,
they'll sort all that out.

1230
00:51:53,930 --> 00:51:55,520
This is all fascinating stuff,
man.

1231
00:51:55,550 --> 00:51:58,040
And I never thought about going to
Panama until about an hour ago.

1232
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:01,880
Now I'm thinking of taking a trip.
Yeah.

1233
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:04,640
It's worth it.
Yeah.

1234
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:06,520
I just want to feel the intravenous
stuff.

1235
00:52:06,550 --> 00:52:08,260
I want to feel what boss Ruben was
talking about.

1236
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:10,060
The lightening bolts coming off my
fingers.

1237
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:12,720
He's a little dramatic.
Yeah.

1238
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:14,950
Well he's definitely dramatic.
I wouldn't say that to his face

1239
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:20,770
with a smile only.
But yeah,

1240
00:52:20,771 --> 00:52:22,570
he's uh,
when you treated him,

1241
00:52:22,571 --> 00:52:25,000
he was going through some pretty
significant issues with his neck.

1242
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,230
Yup.
Yup.

1243
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:28,870
What benefits did he find off of that?
Well,

1244
00:52:28,871 --> 00:52:30,340
you know,
I don't think for his neck,

1245
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:33,820
it structurally,
we weren't able to get the cells there.

1246
00:52:33,821 --> 00:52:35,380
And I don't know if there's enough
laughed,

1247
00:52:35,381 --> 00:52:37,620
you know,
it's a lot of people.

1248
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:39,400
Yeah.
Yeah.

1249
00:52:39,401 --> 00:52:41,650
I mean,
there's nothing,

1250
00:52:41,651 --> 00:52:44,920
if there's nothing structurally to,
you know,

1251
00:52:44,921 --> 00:52:46,660
to do anything.
But a lot of people talk about,

1252
00:52:46,690 --> 00:52:48,070
you know,
hair loss and these cells,

1253
00:52:48,071 --> 00:52:50,650
burke for hair loss and yeah,
they do pretty good job,

1254
00:52:50,651 --> 00:52:53,500
but you can't grow,
you can't grow grass on concrete,

1255
00:52:53,501 --> 00:52:54,460
you know,
and you can't,

1256
00:52:54,850 --> 00:52:56,840
you can't stimulate a nerve to regrow
that tea.

1257
00:52:56,860 --> 00:52:58,400
There's no,
not even a thread left.

1258
00:52:58,401 --> 00:52:59,650
So he,
he didn't get,

1259
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:03,640
I don't believe you got any benefit from
his as accident problem,

1260
00:53:04,030 --> 00:53:05,260
but he,
you know,

1261
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:07,960
the,
the metabolic benefits were fantastic

1262
00:53:07,961 --> 00:53:10,630
for him and,
and energy wise and things like that.

1263
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:12,073
His,
one of,

1264
00:53:12,110 --> 00:53:16,370
one of his issues is that he has some
atrophy on one of his arms because his

1265
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:20,180
nerves in his neck were being pinched
and for a long time and he didn't

1266
00:53:20,181 --> 00:53:22,070
address it quick enough and,
uh,

1267
00:53:22,071 --> 00:53:23,600
it got to the point where his arm is
shrinking.

1268
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:25,770
Right.
And that's one of the reasons why I went

1269
00:53:25,771 --> 00:53:26,040
down there.

1270
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:28,740
Did he experience any benefit from that?
I don't believe he did.

1271
00:53:28,770 --> 00:53:29,603
No,
no.

1272
00:53:29,730 --> 00:53:30,660
That's a tough one,
right?

1273
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:33,510
Regeneration of nerves,
especially really long time.

1274
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:34,081
Uh,
you know,

1275
00:53:34,081 --> 00:53:36,120
for,
for like for spinal cord injury,

1276
00:53:36,570 --> 00:53:37,560
um,
we did,

1277
00:53:37,561 --> 00:53:39,720
uh,
we did a cohort analysis and,

1278
00:53:39,810 --> 00:53:43,020
and basically if,
if they're within one year of injury,

1279
00:53:43,030 --> 00:53:48,030
100% of 100% of the patients ree ree had
restoration of some neurologic function.

1280
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:53,670
It was between one and two years is 82%.
It was after two years.

1281
00:53:53,671 --> 00:53:58,620
It was 50% so the longer it is and the,
and also the older you are,

1282
00:53:58,621 --> 00:54:02,250
the less you have less.
You know the reason these cells work for

1283
00:54:02,251 --> 00:54:04,230
spinal cord injuries,
they don't become spa,

1284
00:54:04,290 --> 00:54:06,510
they don't become nerves or anything
like that.

1285
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:09,330
But uh,
the spinal cord is one of the most

1286
00:54:09,331 --> 00:54:10,780
replete,
uh,

1287
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:13,650
areas of the body when it comes to blood
vessels.

1288
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:15,660
They're very,
they're just barely enough blood vessels

1289
00:54:15,661 --> 00:54:18,720
to keep it alive.
And your liver on the other hand has

1290
00:54:18,721 --> 00:54:20,700
just tons of blood vessels in it.
And your liver,

1291
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:24,780
you can cut 80% of your liver out and it
will regrow itself with your spinal

1292
00:54:24,781 --> 00:54:26,400
cord.
You just kind of digging a little bit

1293
00:54:26,401 --> 00:54:28,740
and it won't repair itself.
That's because there are no blood

1294
00:54:28,741 --> 00:54:32,520
vessels and therefore there are no msc
or very few mscs.

1295
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:36,660
So like one 50th the number of mscs
reside in your spinal cord because we

1296
00:54:36,661 --> 00:54:39,060
built this wonderful cage around it to
protect it.

1297
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:43,230
And so all we're doing is we,
we shoot the cells in there,

1298
00:54:43,231 --> 00:54:46,890
we also give them a,
My v and the cells secrete the things

1299
00:54:46,891 --> 00:54:49,500
that are necessary for this,
for the spinal cord to regenerate

1300
00:54:49,501 --> 00:54:51,900
itself.
But the longer it is from inner jury,

1301
00:54:51,901 --> 00:54:54,630
the more scarring there is and all that
sort of thing.

1302
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:56,850
Uh,
the less benefit you're going to see.

1303
00:54:57,390 --> 00:55:02,070
So do you anticipate a time where
there'll be able to regenerate spinal

1304
00:55:02,071 --> 00:55:06,480
tissue or someone has got a spinal cord
injury where they have partial or some

1305
00:55:06,481 --> 00:55:09,030
sort of paralysis and they can be able
to regenerate?

1306
00:55:09,031 --> 00:55:10,590
That?
I do and I,

1307
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:12,900
and we have many cases that it's already
happened.

1308
00:55:12,901 --> 00:55:13,810
Really?
Yeah.

1309
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:15,480
Like what cases?
Well,

1310
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:19,320
you know Juan Carlos Maria is a
commercial pilot from,

1311
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:22,150
from Costa Rica and he was one day
flying is a,

1312
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:26,460
a national geographic photographer
around and then his private plane and

1313
00:55:26,461 --> 00:55:30,540
they pancake and both of them got spinal
cord injuries and JC say pancakes.

1314
00:55:30,541 --> 00:55:32,430
You mean crashed,
crashed the plane yet?

1315
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,680
Yeah,
they were up on a volcano and it's like

1316
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:38,070
some crazy winds and stuff and it just,
it just dropped out of the sky and

1317
00:55:38,071 --> 00:55:40,050
landed on the ground.
Um,

1318
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:41,730
and,
and he had,

1319
00:55:41,970 --> 00:55:43,920
he had,
uh,

1320
00:55:44,070 --> 00:55:46,500
no,
no function and no,

1321
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:48,360
uh,
no sensation below the injury,

1322
00:55:48,361 --> 00:55:51,510
basically from his belly button down,
had no erectile function,

1323
00:55:51,511 --> 00:55:53,520
no bowel function by function,
any of that stuff.

1324
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:56,070
And you know,
the first time we treated him,

1325
00:55:56,470 --> 00:55:57,870
um,
and how are you treating them?

1326
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:01,050
We're giving them ib cells and
interfaith intrathecal,

1327
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:04,020
so into the spinal fluid.
So the first,

1328
00:56:04,021 --> 00:56:06,420
the first round of treatments,
uh,

1329
00:56:06,450 --> 00:56:07,560
after that,
his,

1330
00:56:07,561 --> 00:56:09,120
his biggest,
his,

1331
00:56:09,630 --> 00:56:12,660
he had,
he described it as like a 10 out of a 10

1332
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:15,570
pain scale.
So we had this neuropathic pain that was

1333
00:56:15,571 --> 00:56:18,180
just like,
he was shoveling down narcotics like

1334
00:56:18,181 --> 00:56:19,980
nobody's business.
And He,

1335
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:22,980
after the first treatment he didn't get
any restoration of function or,

1336
00:56:23,230 --> 00:56:26,110
but his pain dropped from a 10 to a
three.

1337
00:56:26,350 --> 00:56:30,460
And so he got off the narcotics.
Then the second time we treated him,

1338
00:56:30,670 --> 00:56:33,520
he got his left leg back and he could
move it.

1339
00:56:33,550 --> 00:56:35,800
And how long after the treatment?
Um,

1340
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:37,960
okay.
We started treating him six months and

1341
00:56:37,961 --> 00:56:40,060
three days after his accident.
And then,

1342
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:42,930
so he got the,
the first round of treatments was in,

1343
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:45,010
you know,
the first month and it was about three

1344
00:56:45,011 --> 00:56:45,490
months later.

1345
00:56:45,490 --> 00:56:47,860
We did the second round,
but three months later he got his right

1346
00:56:47,861 --> 00:56:52,180
leg back and then three months later,
it was over about a year at 15 month

1347
00:56:52,181 --> 00:56:55,270
period probably in total.
He basically got everything back.

1348
00:56:55,271 --> 00:56:56,920
He got erectile function,
he got bowel,

1349
00:56:56,921 --> 00:56:58,270
bladder,
all that sort of thing.

1350
00:56:58,570 --> 00:56:59,660
And you know,
I just,

1351
00:56:59,810 --> 00:57:02,860
I just had dinner with him the other
night and Costa Rica and he can walk in

1352
00:57:02,861 --> 00:57:05,950
here and he got his commercial pilot's
license back and you know,

1353
00:57:05,951 --> 00:57:08,200
he started a new business and you know,
he has,

1354
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:10,420
he's 100%,
he's,

1355
00:57:10,750 --> 00:57:14,380
I wouldn't say 100% because he does have
a bit of a limp,

1356
00:57:14,381 --> 00:57:16,570
but he broke his leg when he was four
wheeling.

1357
00:57:16,930 --> 00:57:20,700
So a maniac.
Yeah,

1358
00:57:20,710 --> 00:57:24,940
he can't get enough.
This is this before or after the

1359
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:25,870
accident?
They broken.

1360
00:57:26,650 --> 00:57:28,180
No.
So yeah.

1361
00:57:28,181 --> 00:57:31,030
So he got all better and he was
perfectly fine.

1362
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:34,390
And then he goes out and four wheeling
and breaks his leg.

1363
00:57:34,390 --> 00:57:37,840
So yeah,
so he was 100% then he fucked himself up

1364
00:57:37,841 --> 00:57:39,940
again.
So he lifts a little bit.

1365
00:57:39,941 --> 00:57:41,740
But,
but most people don't know that he ever

1366
00:57:41,741 --> 00:57:43,660
had a spinal cord injury,
you know?

1367
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:46,240
That's incredible.
So you feel like with conventional

1368
00:57:46,241 --> 00:57:47,800
treatment that guy would still be in a
wheelchair?

1369
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:49,253
Yeah,
absolutely.

1370
00:57:49,410 --> 00:57:50,410
Yeah.
I mean he was the,

1371
00:57:50,411 --> 00:57:54,430
he made zero progress so that when we
were designing this study that we're

1372
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:57,610
doing at Miami that's being funded by
the Marcus people,

1373
00:57:57,930 --> 00:58:00,580
um,
there are two newer neurosurgeons that

1374
00:58:00,581 --> 00:58:02,350
are on that.
So we wanted to,

1375
00:58:02,530 --> 00:58:06,280
okay,
we're discussing what at what,

1376
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:07,560
at what time,
point you,

1377
00:58:07,561 --> 00:58:11,320
we accept him and these,
these very prominent neurosurgeon said,

1378
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:15,490
let's do six months because at six
months you got 98 to 99% back.

1379
00:58:15,510 --> 00:58:18,880
Everything you're going to have.
So let's do patients or subjects that

1380
00:58:18,881 --> 00:58:20,350
are from six months to two years.

1381
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:22,420
And so that's the,
those are the inclusion criteria.

1382
00:58:22,421 --> 00:58:24,730
That's a timing that we're going to do
for the study.

1383
00:58:25,150 --> 00:58:26,860
At Miami.
This is phenomenal.

1384
00:58:26,861 --> 00:58:29,530
So is that study published online?
Is there anything where,

1385
00:58:29,531 --> 00:58:32,200
or this case rather publish on cases,
posts online?

1386
00:58:32,201 --> 00:58:32,741
Yeah,
absolutely.

1387
00:58:32,741 --> 00:58:34,830
It's referencing my book.
It's on,

1388
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:38,020
yeah,
what's referenced in both books but uh,

1389
00:58:38,350 --> 00:58:40,360
in the spinal cord chapter.
Um,

1390
00:58:40,361 --> 00:58:44,650
so stem cell therapy rising tide is the
one that it's written for the lay

1391
00:58:44,651 --> 00:58:47,370
person.
Um,

1392
00:58:47,710 --> 00:58:49,830
that,
that it,

1393
00:58:49,831 --> 00:58:53,230
so it's referenced in there and the
whole story about Juan Carlos and his,

1394
00:58:53,290 --> 00:58:55,910
you know,
his journey and how he got started and

1395
00:58:55,930 --> 00:58:59,680
everything's in there as well as a
reference to the published article that

1396
00:58:59,710 --> 00:59:03,760
in a scientific journal about his case.
And then MSC is the one that you read if

1397
00:59:03,761 --> 00:59:05,470
you want to go to sleep or if you're a
super nerd.

1398
00:59:05,590 --> 00:59:07,000
Exactly,
exactly.

1399
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:10,960
And sell medicine.com that's the,
that's the website.

1400
00:59:11,050 --> 00:59:12,760
Yep.
CLL medicine.com.

1401
00:59:12,810 --> 00:59:13,151
Well,
listen,

1402
00:59:13,151 --> 00:59:14,620
man,
this is fantastic stuff.

1403
00:59:14,650 --> 00:59:19,000
And uh,
I mean I'm very intrigued and I really

1404
00:59:19,001 --> 00:59:21,070
a,
I hope people that have issues can reach

1405
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:22,100
out to you and a,

1406
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:23,600
and try to see if you can get some
treatment.

1407
00:59:23,601 --> 00:59:25,190
And if a,
I would love to hear back from them.

1408
00:59:25,191 --> 00:59:25,850
I mean,
what,

1409
00:59:25,850 --> 00:59:27,890
what happened with you and what happened
with your dad?

1410
00:59:27,891 --> 00:59:30,950
It's just incredible.
And the stuff that I've experienced in

1411
00:59:30,951 --> 00:59:33,620
the United States seems like it's not
nearly as potent as the stuff that

1412
00:59:33,621 --> 00:59:35,990
you're using down there.
And I've had some pretty dramatic

1413
00:59:35,991 --> 00:59:37,100
results.
Yeah.

1414
00:59:37,330 --> 00:59:39,560
So it's incredible stuff.
Cool.

1415
00:59:39,630 --> 00:59:41,370
Pete?
TJ dillashaw says hi.

1416
00:59:41,430 --> 00:59:42,390
Oh,
you know Tj?

1417
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,270
Yeah.
He came down there and Daddy,

1418
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:46,320
yeah,
I came down here like three months

1419
00:59:46,321 --> 00:59:49,170
before the last fight and then he got
his belt back and he's really done.

1420
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:50,710
Well,
he,

1421
00:59:51,180 --> 00:59:52,500
he told me,
I could tell you everything.

1422
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:55,130
He got ibs and he got his shoulder done
cause he was,

1423
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,300
his shoulder was really bothering them.
So that was,

1424
00:59:57,301 --> 00:59:58,320
that was it.
And then he,

1425
00:59:58,321 --> 01:00:00,660
uh,
and he went down to Panama to get all

1426
01:00:00,661 --> 01:00:01,320
that done.
Yep.

1427
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:03,360
How'd you find out about him or how did
he find out?

1428
01:00:03,430 --> 01:00:05,280
Rather frankly,
I don't know,

1429
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:09,720
uh,
maybe boss or somebody else in that.

1430
01:00:09,721 --> 01:00:14,190
We've had a few MMA guys and I asked him
in Baas Baas and he both said that is

1431
01:00:14,191 --> 01:00:15,630
okay to talk about it.
I'm going down there.

1432
01:00:15,750 --> 01:00:16,583
Yeah.
Yeah.

1433
01:00:16,850 --> 01:00:17,301
Well,
listen,

1434
01:00:17,301 --> 01:00:18,134
man,
uh,

1435
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:21,500
Israel treat real pleasure.
I'm so fascinated about this stuff

1436
01:00:21,501 --> 01:00:23,690
because of my own personal experience
with the,

1437
01:00:23,691 --> 01:00:24,051
you know,
the,

1438
01:00:24,051 --> 01:00:26,450
the limited amount of a stem cell
treatments that I've gotten,

1439
01:00:26,451 --> 01:00:29,510
but I've had great results.
I had a knee injury that was bothering

1440
01:00:29,511 --> 01:00:31,250
me forever.
I don't feel it at all anymore.

1441
01:00:31,510 --> 01:00:32,480
Uh,
the shoulder,

1442
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:34,130
it doesn't bother me at all anymore.
I mean,

1443
01:00:34,131 --> 01:00:34,570
it's,
uh,

1444
01:00:34,570 --> 01:00:36,920
it's pretty amazing stuff.
And from what you're saying,

1445
01:00:36,950 --> 01:00:40,850
I'm getting a very watered down,
not nearly as potent version of what you

1446
01:00:40,851 --> 01:00:42,110
have in Panama.
Yeah.

1447
01:00:42,620 --> 01:00:43,940
Wow.
Okay.

1448
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,550
So a cell medicine.com.
Yes,

1449
01:00:46,551 --> 01:00:47,930
sir.
And then the books again,

1450
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:50,360
our MSC,
say that word again.

1451
01:00:50,361 --> 01:00:55,361
Mesil Mesenchymal stem cells,
stem cells and stem cell therapy arising

1452
01:00:56,270 --> 01:00:57,680
tide.
Mel Gibson.

1453
01:00:57,740 --> 01:00:58,940
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

1454
01:00:58,970 --> 01:01:00,500
This man in here.
Appreciate it.

1455
01:01:00,770 --> 01:01:01,790
All right,
fuckers.

1456
01:01:01,870 --> 01:01:03,410
Read it.
Look it up.

1457
01:01:03,890 --> 01:01:04,723
Get healthy.

1458
01:01:16,370 --> 01:01:17,203
Hm.

1459
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:18,500
Ooh.
