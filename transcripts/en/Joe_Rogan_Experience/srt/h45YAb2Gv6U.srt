1
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:05,123
What's bad?

2
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:06,823
Stevia,

3
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:10,690
the Joe Rogan experience

4
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:13,450
podcast by

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:16,830
looking at a Tom Papa.

6
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:18,323
He wants over this.

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,220
You know what this is?

8
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:20,980
Is Bulletproof coffee bulletproof?

9
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:22,870
The idea behind it is that.

10
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:23,733
Is there any in there?

11
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:24,723
Yeah.

12
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:25,910
I feel so cold.

13
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:26,150
No,

14
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:26,690
it's not.

15
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:27,523
Don't worry.

16
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:28,060
It's just.

17
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:32,470
It's coffee that's blended with
grass fed butter and MCT oil once.

18
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:33,343
It's actually.

19
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,361
It's a very conscious.

20
00:00:35,361 --> 00:00:36,194
It looks milky.

21
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:37,340
It's delicious.

22
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:40,430
The guy who invented it
was a guy named Rob Wolf,

23
00:00:40,431 --> 00:00:45,230
but the guy who popularized it as kind
of a nutty dude that had a lot of false

24
00:00:45,231 --> 00:00:47,750
claims about the benefits of it.

25
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,640
If you want some of this Stevia stuff,

26
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:50,630
this is actually pretty,

27
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:51,411
pretty Yummy,

28
00:00:51,411 --> 00:00:52,640
but you've got to use very little of it.

29
00:00:52,641 --> 00:00:53,474
It's very sweet,

30
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:54,920
but it has no sugar in it.

31
00:00:54,921 --> 00:00:55,970
It's a natural sweetener.

32
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,990
Is there milk in this?

33
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,033
It's butter.

34
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:59,960
Butter is butter.

35
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,590
Grass fed butter blended in with mct oil.

36
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:07,310
Mct Oil is a medium chain triglyceride.

37
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:08,180
Oil Oil.

38
00:01:08,181 --> 00:01:09,014
It's the most,

39
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,720
the healthiest aspects of coconut oil.

40
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:16,610
They're spun in a centrifuge and then
it's extracted and then they take that and

41
00:01:16,611 --> 00:01:19,480
they blended in with the coffee.

42
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,211
This is why I love you,

43
00:01:20,211 --> 00:01:21,020
Joe Rogan.

44
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:21,640
Why

45
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:21,851
doesn't.

46
00:01:21,851 --> 00:01:23,670
This is why this kind of stuff,

47
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:25,690
whenever I listen to you,

48
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:26,670
but whenever I listened to you,

49
00:01:26,671 --> 00:01:29,200
you can know more about
this kind of stuff you like.

50
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,690
When I listened to you
say stuff like that,

51
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:31,350
I'm like,

52
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:32,610
what do I do with my time?

53
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:35,310
I need to read more.

54
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:37,170
So is this is black coffee?

55
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:38,243
No,

56
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,210
it was black,

57
00:01:39,211 --> 00:01:41,160
but then it's blended in with this.

58
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:41,910
Gotcha.

59
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:42,620
Medium tree.

60
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:43,453
It mean that.

61
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:44,303
I don't know what's in that.

62
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:44,820
They're all.

63
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:45,541
They're all bulletproof,

64
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:46,374
right?

65
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:47,663
None of it's black.

66
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,970
It tastes good like it.

67
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:50,990
It's Yummy.

68
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:52,850
Coffee to coffee.

69
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:53,630
Me Too.

70
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:54,530
When I go to sleep at night,

71
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:55,610
I get so excited like,

72
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:56,503
oh,

73
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:58,910
I'm going to close my eyes
now and when I opened them,

74
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:00,080
it's gonna be coffee time again.

75
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:00,923
Really?

76
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:02,361
That's bizarre.

77
00:02:02,361 --> 00:02:02,670
Dude.

78
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:03,890
You might want to look into that.

79
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,960
Do you ever take time off of coughing?

80
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:07,400
No.

81
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:10,840
Not Interested in that.

82
00:02:10,841 --> 00:02:11,020
No,

83
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:11,690
no,

84
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:12,290
no.

85
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:14,600
I'm not fighting it like A.

86
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:14,871
I was like,

87
00:02:14,871 --> 00:02:16,520
maybe I shouldn't have
it in the afternoon.

88
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:18,363
No.

89
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:18,650
Well,

90
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:19,370
it's.

91
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:20,080
There's a lot of things,

92
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:20,913
false,

93
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:25,720
false ideas that people have about
the negative aspects of coughing.

94
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,400
It's not really that bad for you.

95
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:28,370
It's not right now.

96
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:31,030
It's a dehydrating element.

97
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,250
It has a diuretic effect,

98
00:02:33,251 --> 00:02:34,420
but you just drink water,

99
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:35,290
be right.

100
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:36,130
I need energy.

101
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:39,130
I need to get through all day and night,

102
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,360
but the problem is with some people that
stresses their adrenals can drink too

103
00:02:43,361 --> 00:02:44,194
much coffee.

104
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,000
It's like many things.

105
00:02:46,001 --> 00:02:46,391
You know,

106
00:02:46,391 --> 00:02:46,860
you can't.

107
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:47,740
You go overboard.

108
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:48,070
Yeah.

109
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:49,360
If you have too much salt,

110
00:02:49,361 --> 00:02:50,230
that will fucking kill you.

111
00:02:50,231 --> 00:02:50,411
I mean,

112
00:02:50,411 --> 00:02:50,561
look,

113
00:02:50,561 --> 00:02:51,730
if you eat a pound of salt,

114
00:02:51,731 --> 00:02:53,730
you're a dead man right now.

115
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:54,240
Yeah,

116
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:54,490
no,

117
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:55,101
that's how I feel.

118
00:02:55,101 --> 00:02:58,520
I feel like we're grown ups now and there
are things that are kind of vices and

119
00:02:58,521 --> 00:03:01,090
you have to them like drinking.

120
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:04,240
I'm not going to drink
like I did when I was 25.

121
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,350
I drink like a,

122
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:06,070
like a grownup,

123
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:06,903
like a gentleman,

124
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,691
like a gentleman,

125
00:03:07,691 --> 00:03:08,830
5:00 comes,

126
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,270
Martini Shaker,

127
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,440
one cocktail.

128
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:12,280
That's it.

129
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,000
Who's getting hurt?

130
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,020
No one's getting hurt.

131
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:14,751
Matter of fact,

132
00:03:14,751 --> 00:03:19,250
they've shown that a glass of wine a day
is actually as healthy as exercise for

133
00:03:19,251 --> 00:03:19,920
some people.

134
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,753
Really.

135
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:21,541
Who were those?

136
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:22,051
Some people.

137
00:03:22,051 --> 00:03:23,080
How do you know if you want to something?

138
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:23,311
Oh,

139
00:03:23,311 --> 00:03:25,120
you probably most.

140
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,140
I think the idea behind
a glass of wine is,

141
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:28,561
first of all,

142
00:03:28,561 --> 00:03:29,940
there's resveratrol in it,

143
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:30,691
which is a,

144
00:03:30,691 --> 00:03:31,380
um,

145
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:35,910
a natural antioxidant that comes from
grapes and exists in wine and it's

146
00:03:35,911 --> 00:03:36,810
actually very good for her.

147
00:03:36,811 --> 00:03:39,180
I actually take it as a
supplement because Charles,

148
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,053
very good for you.

149
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:40,381
But,

150
00:03:40,381 --> 00:03:41,220
and then on top of that,

151
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:46,190
there's a certain amount of
benefit in a stress relieving the,

152
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:46,580
the,

153
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:47,880
the wind hits you and you're like,

154
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:49,510
ah.

155
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,480
And that calmness and strength,

156
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:53,220
it's very hard to,

157
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,820
under or over emphasize
how important that is.

158
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:57,810
Huge.

159
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,100
It's a massive,

160
00:03:59,100 --> 00:03:59,880
huge.

161
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,110
Now I have a,

162
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:06,170
I do yoga and it's
primarily because of that.

163
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,080
Yeah.

164
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,280
When I'm not doing it,

165
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:10,530
my stress level is so much higher.

166
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,220
It's not the stress levels.

167
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:13,680
Stress is always the same.

168
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,240
My life is my life,

169
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,740
but it just kind of rolls off
when I'm really active with it.

170
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,060
You just kind of rolls off.

171
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:21,631
Manageable,

172
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:21,900
right?

173
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:22,320
Yeah,

174
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:22,681
exactly.

175
00:04:22,681 --> 00:04:23,514
Smoke weed.

176
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:24,240
Yeah,

177
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,073
there you go.

178
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:27,120
It is good for you.

179
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,713
I've kind of.

180
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:30,330
This is what I've cut back.

181
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,210
I know.

182
00:04:31,211 --> 00:04:32,910
Well I know I'm coming back.

183
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:33,841
Coming back to weed.

184
00:04:33,841 --> 00:04:34,674
Yeah.

185
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,090
I got some right here.

186
00:04:36,091 --> 00:04:37,440
If you want to find one of these bad boys.

187
00:04:37,441 --> 00:04:38,540
I don't know.

188
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:39,360
I got to drive.

189
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,230
Scared to drive.

190
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:40,780
I'm.

191
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,310
This is.

192
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:41,551
Yeah.

193
00:04:41,551 --> 00:04:42,384
I am scared.

194
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,041
I am scared.

195
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:44,874
You know what it is.

196
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:48,780
I have a friend who's an older guy,

197
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:51,030
comedian talking about me now.

198
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,273
You're young man.

199
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,040
This guy,

200
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,440
he's gay and that's definitely not me,

201
00:04:55,441 --> 00:04:55,740
bro.

202
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:56,190
Came up.

203
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,480
He came up during the,

204
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:01,830
during the time when
people weren't out right.

205
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,990
And now everybody's out.

206
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:07,620
But because he grew up during that
time and he's pretty much out.

207
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,450
He still like shaky.

208
00:05:09,451 --> 00:05:10,284
Like he doesn't.

209
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,131
He's still scared.

210
00:05:11,131 --> 00:05:15,510
Like he will speak in hushed tones about
certain stuff because that's how we

211
00:05:15,511 --> 00:05:16,050
grew up.

212
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:21,030
That's how I feel with weed I came up
with was illegal and you're paranoid all

213
00:05:21,031 --> 00:05:22,530
the time and trying to sneak it.

214
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,173
I'm 46,

215
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:25,700
so you're a year younger than me.

216
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,481
That's ridiculous.

217
00:05:26,481 --> 00:05:27,110
Yeah.

218
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:27,930
I'm 47.

219
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:29,070
Are you really smoke it son?

220
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:34,160
Don't be scared or this is what I
smoked up until I guess like maybe,

221
00:05:35,881 --> 00:05:36,211
I don't know,

222
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:37,560
five years after college,

223
00:05:37,561 --> 00:05:40,470
six years maybe something like a
good 10 year block of all the time.

224
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,573
And then,

225
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:42,630
uh,

226
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,530
I wasn't as funny.

227
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:44,423
I wasn't as,

228
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,420
I really wasn't,

229
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:45,840
I,

230
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,410
it was taking away my funny and uh,

231
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:53,930
so I put it down and stayed away
for a pretty long time and uh,

232
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:56,340
I've been a comedian for 20 years,

233
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:00,560
so like 10 years of it I was doing it
and then last 10 and I haven't been doing

234
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:01,870
it and uh,

235
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:04,820
just in the last year or two,

236
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:05,750
I'm like,

237
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,280
I'm bringing it back in.

238
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,630
Just been the last year or two.

239
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,260
Yeah.

240
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:10,680
What?

241
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,513
And it was,

242
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,050
was it a pragmatic decision,

243
00:06:13,051 --> 00:06:14,220
like a funny decision?

244
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:15,640
Um,

245
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:15,971
yeah,

246
00:06:15,971 --> 00:06:16,210
it's,

247
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:16,601
yeah,

248
00:06:16,601 --> 00:06:17,620
it's pretty thought.

249
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,250
Yeah.

250
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,031
It's pretty thoughtful.

251
00:06:19,031 --> 00:06:19,864
Like I,

252
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:24,850
I stopped because there was this kid
that I used to in high school I used to

253
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:27,100
riff with all the time
we would get together.

254
00:06:27,101 --> 00:06:27,480
He wasn't,

255
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,920
was just an Irish naturally funny,

256
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:30,491
you know,

257
00:06:30,491 --> 00:06:31,750
like naturally Irish,

258
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,040
those guys that could just curse,

259
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:37,000
like nobody could and just hilarious and
the two of us would always get together

260
00:06:37,001 --> 00:06:40,270
at these parties and we would just screw
around and everyone would be laughing

261
00:06:40,271 --> 00:06:40,630
and you know,

262
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,460
we're riffing together and it was great.

263
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,360
And so I went away and came back one time
in college and it was high and we met

264
00:06:51,731 --> 00:06:53,890
up at a party and he just
ran circles around me.

265
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:56,290
I completely didn't have it.

266
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:56,860
I was like,

267
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:57,670
Duh,

268
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:58,150
because you're too.

269
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,080
I was too high.

270
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:00,363
And uh,

271
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,840
I always thought about that.

272
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,160
And then as I was going along it was like,

273
00:07:03,161 --> 00:07:04,020
it wasn't as productive.

274
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,110
It wasn't as funny.

275
00:07:05,111 --> 00:07:05,944
It just wasn't,

276
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,030
wasn't working for me.

277
00:07:07,031 --> 00:07:10,270
So I just completely put it down and then,

278
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:10,450
you know,

279
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:13,180
worked on my comedy and did everything
that I wanted to do as a comedian.

280
00:07:13,181 --> 00:07:15,040
And now the same thing as the alcohol,

281
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,053
like a gentleman,

282
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,310
I know how to smoke,

283
00:07:18,311 --> 00:07:20,020
now I know how to drink the,

284
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:20,973
you know what I mean?

285
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:25,120
So I kind of bring it back and
especially I really use it,

286
00:07:25,121 --> 00:07:26,830
especially when I'm writing when.

287
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:27,850
Yeah,

288
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:29,830
I always at least have
a notebook around me.

289
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:31,803
You know,

290
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,850
don't like to smoke socially.

291
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:34,960
No,

292
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,793
no,

293
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,130
you get weird.

294
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:38,763
Um,

295
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:39,561
yeah.

296
00:07:39,561 --> 00:07:41,030
I get a little weird right now.

297
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,043
I'm always weird.

298
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,633
I always feel weird.

299
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:48,920
I always had a great quote
they asked her about.

300
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:51,880
She's gone to Coachella
and the asked her a,

301
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:53,420
are you going to get high or whatever.

302
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:53,781
She's like,

303
00:07:53,781 --> 00:07:54,531
do you know I do this.

304
00:07:54,531 --> 00:07:55,220
I do that.

305
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:55,311
Well,

306
00:07:55,311 --> 00:07:56,140
you get high there.

307
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:56,900
She's like,

308
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:57,321
I don't know.

309
00:07:57,321 --> 00:07:57,621
She goes,

310
00:07:57,621 --> 00:07:58,454
I have a rule.

311
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,810
I never get high.

312
00:07:59,811 --> 00:08:01,400
If I have to pretend that I'm not.

313
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,053
Isn't that great?

314
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,760
That really hit home for me.

315
00:08:05,761 --> 00:08:06,480
I'm like,

316
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,313
there's so many.

317
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:08,610
I don't want to be like,

318
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:09,001
no,

319
00:08:09,001 --> 00:08:09,331
I'm not.

320
00:08:09,331 --> 00:08:10,070
I'm not.

321
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,651
I'm okay.

322
00:08:10,651 --> 00:08:10,831
Yeah.

323
00:08:10,831 --> 00:08:12,390
You should never lie about being high.

324
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,410
Look,

325
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,130
people do.

326
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:16,740
It's like people lie about
three things on a regular basis.

327
00:08:16,741 --> 00:08:17,820
They lie about being high.

328
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,480
They lie about whether or not they were
awake when you called them and they lie.

329
00:08:21,481 --> 00:08:25,890
Whether or not they forwarded three things
that are super common that people lie

330
00:08:25,891 --> 00:08:26,280
about.

331
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,510
I was just with a friend of mine.

332
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:28,500
Uh,

333
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,333
I'll say his name,

334
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:29,760
Danny,

335
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,640
the guy who runs largo and uh,

336
00:08:31,641 --> 00:08:34,750
we were just having coffee this morning
and we're the only two people outside

337
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,300
any foreign fucker.

338
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:36,990
I mean,

339
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:38,270
like a big cabbage fart

340
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:41,160
planning.

341
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:41,993
He's like,

342
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,833
I didn't do it.

343
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:44,820
Yes you did.

344
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,150
Yes you did.

345
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,350
Was even if it was mine and it
snuck out and I wasn't aware.

346
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:52,840
My never smell like
big Scottish and Irish.

347
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:55,500
He completely lied right to face.

348
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:56,040
And then when we were

349
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,330
saying goodbye at the,

350
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:57,751
at the,

351
00:08:57,751 --> 00:08:57,930
uh,

352
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:58,763
parking meters,

353
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:02,410
the smell came up again and I just let
it go and when he's not going to come to

354
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,493
some people,

355
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:05,520
some people would just fart all over.

356
00:09:05,521 --> 00:09:07,350
You smoked the whole time.

357
00:09:07,351 --> 00:09:08,510
Did you smoke all the way through?

358
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,770
Did you pick up weed later on?

359
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,280
I picked up when I was 30.

360
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,293
When you were 30.

361
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:14,070
So last 17 years.

362
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:14,701
See,

363
00:09:14,701 --> 00:09:16,410
that's healthy because
your brain was already.

364
00:09:16,411 --> 00:09:17,670
You were already Joe Rogan.

365
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,140
I had a bad idea of it though.

366
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:21,420
My idea of weed was a
weed was bad for you.

367
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,370
My idea was that we'd was just,

368
00:09:23,371 --> 00:09:24,050
uh,

369
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:24,520
you know,

370
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:24,900
was,

371
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,720
it was a crutch and it was
for weak minded people.

372
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:28,740
You know,

373
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,573
I had this,

374
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,070
I had a lot of misconceptions about pot.

375
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,233
Yeah,

376
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,313
I picked it up.

377
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:38,190
I guess I want to see what year was it?

378
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:39,963
Um,

379
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:40,561
it was,

380
00:09:40,561 --> 00:09:40,741
yeah,

381
00:09:40,741 --> 00:09:43,000
it was somewhere around 2000.

382
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,980
What was your first time?

383
00:09:43,981 --> 00:09:44,680
Was it a big deal?

384
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,513
It was your first time.

385
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,030
Um,

386
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:50,730
you have this probably before 2000 now
let's think about it because it was

387
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,640
before y two k because I was
high when y twoK was happening,

388
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:54,930
was terrified.

389
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,990
It's all going down really happening.

390
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:58,801
Um,

391
00:09:58,801 --> 00:09:59,820
my ideas were about,

392
00:09:59,821 --> 00:10:04,320
were all wrong and they are all
based on people being losers.

393
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:04,671
Yeah.

394
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:08,250
There's also based on just
the idea of drugs themselves,

395
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:13,460
I had grown up around quite a few people
that had drug problems and especially

396
00:10:13,741 --> 00:10:14,574
with coke,

397
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,780
which I'd never have done.

398
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:16,200
Yeah.

399
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,730
And it's because of that.

400
00:10:17,731 --> 00:10:19,950
It's because of seeing these
people like their lives,

401
00:10:19,951 --> 00:10:21,870
like get devastated by this drug.

402
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,370
So I was a,

403
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,780
I was terrified of it all.

404
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,730
Drugs I felt like made you a loser.

405
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,713
Yeah.

406
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,100
Well it's not.

407
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,110
Yeah,

408
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:31,620
I mean if you're around it and you see it,

409
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,300
I didn't think that,

410
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:34,890
uh,

411
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:38,100
it was so much loser thing
and I don't at this point,

412
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:39,990
I do think you can start too early.

413
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,090
I do think as a parent,

414
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,960
I'm saying this in case my children's
friends listened to the show and then tell

415
00:10:45,961 --> 00:10:46,794
my daughter.

416
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:47,643
But uh,

417
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,920
but I do think like at a certain,

418
00:10:49,921 --> 00:10:51,330
like if you can start to early,

419
00:10:51,331 --> 00:10:56,220
everyone I know who started too early
got a little weird if you spun out a

420
00:10:56,221 --> 00:10:56,970
little bit,

421
00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:00,090
but your brain has to kind of become you.

422
00:11:00,091 --> 00:11:03,270
You're so just to figure
out who you are and what,

423
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,170
you know,

424
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:07,200
your brain is really hyper developing
then like why mess with it?

425
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:07,681
Yeah.

426
00:11:07,681 --> 00:11:09,660
I think you're taking like a real big,

427
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,760
like you take a big leap from your normal
consciousness when you're getting high

428
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,720
and we just sort of getting the
feel of your normal consciousness.

429
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,490
If you're getting high all the time,

430
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,980
it can miss out on a developmental period.

431
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,000
Completely,

432
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:25,740
very confusing period.

433
00:11:25,741 --> 00:11:26,050
And Lynn,

434
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:27,240
why throw that into it?

435
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,231
Yeah,

436
00:11:28,231 --> 00:11:28,471
no,

437
00:11:28,471 --> 00:11:29,460
I completely agree.

438
00:11:29,461 --> 00:11:33,060
I think that there's certain amount of
people especially that should never try

439
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:33,923
weed.

440
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,010
It's not for them.

441
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,000
Not at all.

442
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:38,820
Did you feel like by the time
you were 30 when you started,

443
00:11:38,821 --> 00:11:43,230
like you kind of were done with all
of figuring out who you were kind of

444
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:44,350
weirdness or were you,

445
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,950
um,

446
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:49,500
no real figuring out who I am?

447
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:50,120
I think will.

448
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:50,953
You're always.

449
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,500
I think if you really are
not growing as a person,

450
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:54,760
you're,

451
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,350
you're basically dead in the water,

452
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:56,740
right?

453
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,090
I mean it's A.

454
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,290
I'm not perfect.

455
00:11:59,291 --> 00:11:59,981
No one's perfect.

456
00:11:59,981 --> 00:12:00,820
So if you're not perfect,

457
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:04,030
you're constantly trying to improve
on various aspects of your life.

458
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:05,201
And as a comic,

459
00:12:05,201 --> 00:12:08,210
especially when you
abandoned your material,

460
00:12:08,211 --> 00:12:09,850
like you have an act,

461
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,850
you put out a special and then
you toss all your material out,

462
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:13,990
you're starting fresh.

463
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:18,990
You kinda got to reinvent like what
your thoughts are reinventing you.

464
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:22,540
Definitely reinventing what
you're presenting on stage.

465
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:22,990
Yeah.

466
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:27,990
So there's this constant sort of cycle
or developmental period where you go

467
00:12:29,561 --> 00:12:30,394
through,

468
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:30,780
you,

469
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,650
you put out the Special Yuh,

470
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,130
Yuh Yuh,

471
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:33,963
Yuh Yuh.

472
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,160
It too is,

473
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:39,700
is fine an edge as you think that you
can and then you release it and then you

474
00:12:39,701 --> 00:12:39,821
go,

475
00:12:39,821 --> 00:12:40,210
okay,

476
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:41,200
let's start all over again.

477
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,550
When you're starting all over again.

478
00:12:42,551 --> 00:12:43,930
There's a lot of thinking involved.

479
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:47,440
That's why those old
guys that never wrote.

480
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:47,940
Yeah,

481
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,200
there was a period like,

482
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,620
yeah,

483
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,500
we've all seen those guys that have
the same act from 20 years ago.

484
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:54,670
Scary.

485
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:55,750
Those poor bastards,

486
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,860
they become irrelevant.

487
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:57,821
They really quick.

488
00:12:57,821 --> 00:12:58,210
They,

489
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:59,043
they die,

490
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:00,460
die in their mind.

491
00:13:00,461 --> 00:13:01,690
Their mind is dead.

492
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,520
Dead.

493
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,890
Like you see them on stage
telling those old jokes,

494
00:13:04,891 --> 00:13:05,051
you know,

495
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:06,700
like fucking Christ man.

496
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:07,563
Yeah.

497
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,870
There was a guy that came into
the improv not too long ago.

498
00:13:09,871 --> 00:13:12,540
It was doing Oj jokes if,

499
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,230
unless it's a really good Oj joke.

500
00:13:14,231 --> 00:13:14,411
I mean,

501
00:13:14,411 --> 00:13:15,244
you never know.

502
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:16,610
It wasn't like that.

503
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,850
A guy has a new take on an old story.

504
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:20,320
Oh,

505
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,190
that old yarn.

506
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,113
But it was like.

507
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,130
So you guys heard about Oj,

508
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:24,973
right?

509
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:26,740
You think he was guilty.

510
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,580
But we're so self aware as Comedians,

511
00:13:30,581 --> 00:13:31,960
you're always looking at yourself,

512
00:13:31,961 --> 00:13:33,070
analyzing yourself,

513
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:34,151
you know what I mean?

514
00:13:34,151 --> 00:13:34,450
We're,

515
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:36,830
we're kind of hyper aware.

516
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:37,470
We,

517
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:38,303
you kind of have to.

518
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:39,550
Otherwise you can bomb.

519
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:42,760
You ever have like a big thing happen in
your life and you go back on stage and

520
00:13:42,761 --> 00:13:43,270
you're like,

521
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:43,541
oh,

522
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:46,210
I'm a different guy than the
guy that wrote this stuff.

523
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,200
Oh definitely.

524
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:47,890
You know what I mean?

525
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:50,510
Well that's the beautiful thing about
getting rid of your act every couple of

526
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:54,250
years or at least doing a new specialist
starting from scratch every couple of

527
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:54,760
years.

528
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,430
So you can kind of represent
who you are right now.

529
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,200
Right.

530
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:58,421
You know,

531
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:03,040
I'll go back and listen to like
my first CD from 1999 Christ.

532
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:04,440
It's hard.

533
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,690
Any leads that was like
a CD on warner brothers,

534
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:07,720
like a real cd.

535
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:10,060
Like I can go back and listen
to recordings before that.

536
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,130
Fucking God awful.

537
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,360
You had to go back and do your own
act from your first couple of years.

538
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,223
Oh my God.

539
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,460
What's amazing to me,

540
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:22,390
and I always think about is people were
hiring me when I was telling me stokes

541
00:14:22,391 --> 00:14:26,050
and like I was making money with this act.

542
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,280
It was so bad.

543
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:27,821
Well,

544
00:14:27,821 --> 00:14:30,370
if you went to any comedy
club across the country,

545
00:14:30,371 --> 00:14:33,740
you see various stages of
development and you're always gonna.

546
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,593
See that?

547
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:38,530
I remember really clearly like struggling
and trying to put it together and then

548
00:14:38,531 --> 00:14:40,990
go into see someone
really good and be like,

549
00:14:40,991 --> 00:14:41,920
fuck.

550
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:43,270
Never getting there.

551
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:43,780
Yeah.

552
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,130
This is never happening.

553
00:14:45,131 --> 00:14:46,990
I know it makes you almost want to quit.

554
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:47,600
I know,

555
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,940
you know it has been doing that
to me lately as a Maria Bamford.

556
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:57,730
I watched her ran into her a couple
times and she was just so prolific in

557
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,690
writing so much in such good
stuff and I was just like,

558
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,351
it's good.

559
00:15:03,351 --> 00:15:04,040
It's like you go,

560
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:04,820
all right,

561
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,990
let me look at my material.

562
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:06,500
Hm,

563
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,760
what am I cheating on?

564
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,860
Getting labs with this whole act,

565
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:12,740
but what am I really?

566
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:13,270
What am,

567
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,150
what am I mugging?

568
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:14,920
What am I,

569
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:19,520
where is there not really a solid idea
or solid joke and you start looking at

570
00:15:19,521 --> 00:15:19,730
you like,

571
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:20,180
all right,

572
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:20,400
I'm,

573
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,440
I'm cheating here.

574
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,120
That's a good line here is.

575
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:25,820
I don't know why they're laughing at this.

576
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:28,340
Maybe it was my funny face when I say it,

577
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:33,400
you know what it's like to really
kind of look at it and analyze it.

578
00:15:33,861 --> 00:15:38,450
It's like this is kind of
cheating 80 percent of the time.

579
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:40,823
Well that's why like,

580
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,310
you know,

581
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:43,350
being inspired by your peers.

582
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,190
It's one of the good things about being
in a big comedy community like New York

583
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:51,150
or is it you get to be around like all
these high level comics on a regular

584
00:15:51,151 --> 00:15:54,360
basis and you sorta can compare
yourself to them completely.

585
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,770
This is why I'm psyched to be here and I
really am very happy to be here because

586
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,170
I've been a fan of yours for a long,

587
00:16:00,171 --> 00:16:03,920
long time and we never
really never really hung out.

588
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,910
We never really is.

589
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:07,250
It's a big sea of comedy.

590
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:10,880
If we could both be in it
for that long and not really

591
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:12,443
see each other,

592
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:13,523
you know what I mean?

593
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:14,910
That's a big pool.

594
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:15,091
Well,

595
00:16:15,091 --> 00:16:16,200
there's a lot of places to go.

596
00:16:16,201 --> 00:16:17,034
You know,

597
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:19,140
how many we've been having
this discussion lately.

598
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:21,180
How many comics do you think
there are in this country?

599
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:24,630
Like working professional
comedians who actually,

600
00:16:24,631 --> 00:16:25,464
that's what they do.

601
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:29,100
It's their only gig or
if they're only Gig,

602
00:16:29,101 --> 00:16:30,780
they're like real headliners,

603
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,340
like the tomato of a TV
show or something like that,

604
00:16:32,341 --> 00:16:33,174
but there are legit,

605
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,171
you know,

606
00:16:34,171 --> 00:16:35,004
or you know,

607
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:36,870
a middle act and make their living.

608
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,760
They can make their living off comedy.

609
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:39,600
Yeah.

610
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,820
I'm going to say a real pro,

611
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:43,860
a real pro thousand.

612
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,530
I'm going to go a little higher.

613
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:47,703
Really?

614
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:48,773
Yeah.

615
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,690
Good for you.

616
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:50,690
There's a lot of gigs at.

617
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:52,810
I'm really bad at math,

618
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:55,090
but then wait a minute.

619
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,820
How many as a thousand fingers out?

620
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,073
Uh,

621
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:00,571
yeah,

622
00:17:00,571 --> 00:17:04,450
because I mean think about
every single night there's,

623
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,960
there's gigs happening everywhere.

624
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,610
Every stupid town.

625
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:11,460
There's some bar,

626
00:17:11,461 --> 00:17:12,690
some corporate gigs,

627
00:17:12,691 --> 00:17:14,100
some theater show,

628
00:17:14,101 --> 00:17:15,510
some something going on.

629
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:16,461
Yeah.

630
00:17:16,461 --> 00:17:19,260
But a lot of those I wouldn't
even think are real comics.

631
00:17:19,261 --> 00:17:21,960
They're just like the
best that that city has.

632
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:22,321
You know,

633
00:17:22,321 --> 00:17:24,750
they're not really like
touring like that same time.

634
00:17:24,751 --> 00:17:27,240
It's probably not going
to like Indiana next week.

635
00:17:27,241 --> 00:17:28,074
And then like,

636
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:28,440
you know,

637
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,520
Florida that does have.

638
00:17:30,521 --> 00:17:31,980
But they are pro comics.

639
00:17:31,981 --> 00:17:35,370
Like there's like you've always talk
about Boston having all those local

640
00:17:35,371 --> 00:17:37,470
professional communities that never left,

641
00:17:37,471 --> 00:17:37,711
that are,

642
00:17:37,711 --> 00:17:39,330
were undeniably pros.

643
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:40,610
Yeah.

644
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:42,470
I guess I don't think
it's maybe a thousand.

645
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:43,523
That's a lot.

646
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,230
Silat thousands of

647
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:46,571
out of that thousand.

648
00:17:46,571 --> 00:17:46,751
Okay.

649
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,760
Let's call it a thousand.

650
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:48,910
Out of that thousand,

651
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:50,130
how many are good?

652
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:50,993
200.

653
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,030
200 are good.

654
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,143
200.

655
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:54,660
Yeah.

656
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,340
Yeah.

657
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,460
I would say that's about right.

658
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:57,270
Yeah.

659
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:57,790
And then,

660
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:58,031
you know,

661
00:17:58,031 --> 00:17:58,864
you've got to add,

662
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:00,000
there's,

663
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,241
you know,

664
00:18:00,241 --> 00:18:03,020
there's a variability based on
taste and subjective thinking.

665
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:03,863
Sure.

666
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:04,621
But you know,

667
00:18:04,621 --> 00:18:06,120
you know when someone's good.

668
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:06,930
Yeah.

669
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:07,171
I mean,

670
00:18:07,171 --> 00:18:07,501
but what,

671
00:18:07,501 --> 00:18:07,800
you know,

672
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,270
what I might think is good.

673
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,120
I might have a higher standard and some,

674
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,000
some I've been,

675
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,930
have had people tell me,

676
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:14,190
this guy's really funny.

677
00:18:14,191 --> 00:18:14,851
You should see them then.

678
00:18:14,851 --> 00:18:16,660
I've got black guys.

679
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:17,491
Fucking dog.

680
00:18:17,491 --> 00:18:17,821
Shit.

681
00:18:17,821 --> 00:18:18,571
This is terrible.

682
00:18:18,571 --> 00:18:19,404
I can't watch this.

683
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:20,303
Yeah,

684
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,413
yeah.

685
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,920
But then there's other guys
that you see and you're like,

686
00:18:22,921 --> 00:18:23,220
alright,

687
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:23,761
I get it.

688
00:18:23,761 --> 00:18:24,511
It's not for me,

689
00:18:24,511 --> 00:18:26,620
but I get that he's right.

690
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:27,870
Turning a lot of people on.

691
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:29,820
He's not horrible.

692
00:18:29,821 --> 00:18:31,380
I just don't want to listen to it.

693
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:31,700
Well,

694
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:34,020
there's some people that are
like really good performers,

695
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:34,740
you know,

696
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:37,860
and they just fucking dollop
something that's really not there.

697
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:38,763
Right.

698
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:41,933
You know,

699
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,980
it's called cheap laughs.

700
00:18:43,981 --> 00:18:45,180
Built on fake energy.

701
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:45,870
Yeah.

702
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:46,320
What does,

703
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:46,611
you know?

704
00:18:46,611 --> 00:18:47,430
There's,

705
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:48,450
there's something to be learned.

706
00:18:48,451 --> 00:18:49,284
Even from that.

707
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:52,250
I mean that's one of the things that I
always used to say about Carlos when ceos

708
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,180
that I never understood
why people were laughing,

709
00:18:54,181 --> 00:18:55,014
but it was amazing.

710
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,610
The energy that he put out,

711
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:57,300
you get the.

712
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,290
I'd never got it,

713
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,190
like roads,

714
00:18:59,191 --> 00:19:00,840
like sit there like dead face going,

715
00:19:00,841 --> 00:19:02,190
what the fuck is happening here?

716
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:07,310
But there they were all caught up in this
energy and momentum of the blah blah,

717
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:07,401
blah,

718
00:19:07,401 --> 00:19:07,521
blah,

719
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:07,710
blah.

720
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:09,120
All this shit that was going on.

721
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:09,511
And I was like,

722
00:19:09,511 --> 00:19:09,871
wow,

723
00:19:09,871 --> 00:19:10,561
this is crazy.

724
00:19:10,561 --> 00:19:14,370
Like there are guys that
have that sort of like big,

725
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:15,061
loud,

726
00:19:15,061 --> 00:19:19,290
fake thing where they don't really give
a fuck about what they're talking about

727
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:20,124
new.

728
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:21,130
But they're kind of.

729
00:19:21,131 --> 00:19:22,950
It's closer to politicians.

730
00:19:22,951 --> 00:19:23,910
And they are comedians.

731
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:25,010
Yeah.

732
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,670
They know how to turn it on the crowd.

733
00:19:26,671 --> 00:19:27,870
They know how to work it.

734
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:30,330
But there's a clause for the ladies.

735
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:32,940
Ladies are working hard out there.

736
00:19:32,941 --> 00:19:33,421
Gentlemen,

737
00:19:33,421 --> 00:19:33,811
come on.

738
00:19:33,811 --> 00:19:35,700
How about a round of
applause for those ladies?

739
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:36,600
But one for the troops.

740
00:19:36,601 --> 00:19:37,434
Can we get one of

741
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:39,510
these?

742
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:40,343
That's those.

743
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:45,370
Those like really strategic
things that people will say.

744
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,730
They'll say things where you go,

745
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:48,001
oh,

746
00:19:48,001 --> 00:19:48,834
you whore,

747
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,520
you fucking whore.

748
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:52,710
Oh the ladies really have it hard.

749
00:19:52,711 --> 00:19:53,580
Am I right ladies?

750
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:56,800
Oh,

751
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,870
the worst is though when you're.

752
00:19:57,871 --> 00:19:59,550
Especially if you're in showcase clubs,

753
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:01,950
you're wondering like eight
guys that night and it's like,

754
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:02,960
oh,

755
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,110
they're telling me I gotta go.

756
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,191
I gotta go,

757
00:20:05,191 --> 00:20:06,220
guys are giving me the lag.

758
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,050
No,

759
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:12,050
please stay there telling
me I gotta go up there.

760
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,650
Really politicians,

761
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:14,941
a lot of that.

762
00:20:14,941 --> 00:20:15,580
Yeah.

763
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,413
It kind of slick.

764
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,210
But you kinda gotta be a little bit,

765
00:20:18,211 --> 00:20:18,451
right?

766
00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:20,580
You've got to kind of get
people to like you a little,

767
00:20:20,581 --> 00:20:24,300
especially if you want to push forth
and he really controversial idea.

768
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,820
You're going to kind of
sneaking in on them somehow.

769
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,050
Yeah.

770
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:29,430
Like what we were talking about earlier,

771
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,273
wound full of sugar.

772
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:34,380
Well we were talking about earlier where
you were saying that because it's so

773
00:20:34,381 --> 00:20:36,420
easy to criticize comedians these days,

774
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:39,510
so many people go after people
for controversial jokes.

775
00:20:39,511 --> 00:20:42,120
You were talking about how these
young guys you're seeing onstage,

776
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,570
young gals as well are saying jokes,

777
00:20:45,571 --> 00:20:47,800
but there's still like before say it,

778
00:20:47,801 --> 00:20:48,070
they had

779
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:48,281
to say,

780
00:20:48,281 --> 00:20:48,491
look,

781
00:20:48,491 --> 00:20:50,130
you know I am not racist.

782
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:51,643
Yeah.

783
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:52,480
Yeah.

784
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:52,960
I watched.

785
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,960
I watched five guys in front of me at
the Improv in la go up and these are all

786
00:20:58,211 --> 00:20:59,830
young guys and they're all coming up.

787
00:20:59,831 --> 00:21:01,240
They don't really have much credit,

788
00:21:01,241 --> 00:21:02,074
but they're working.

789
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:06,280
They've got spot at the Improv and
every anything that came up with,

790
00:21:06,281 --> 00:21:09,430
if it was about race
or religion or gender,

791
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,410
they would apologize before the joke.

792
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:12,310
I'm like,

793
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,240
Oh shit.

794
00:21:13,241 --> 00:21:15,040
It's gotten to this level.

795
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:16,780
Everyone's now scared.

796
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,000
We're gonna,

797
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,210
we're gonna be Improv.

798
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:22,630
There's probably 50 people
in the audience tops.

799
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:23,650
No.

800
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:24,191
You know what I mean?

801
00:21:24,191 --> 00:21:27,520
It's nothing you should
have if you're not free now,

802
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,211
when,

803
00:21:28,211 --> 00:21:29,020
when,

804
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:29,231
what?

805
00:21:29,231 --> 00:21:30,390
All it takes is one blogger,

806
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,233
tom.

807
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,151
Well,

808
00:21:32,151 --> 00:21:36,320
there's this thing at the comedy store
that they do every Tuesday night called

809
00:21:36,321 --> 00:21:37,041
the roast battle.

810
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:37,670
Have you ever seen it?

811
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:38,090
I haven't.

812
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:38,810
I've heard about it.

813
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:39,643
It's really funny.

814
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:39,970
Yeah.

815
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:42,080
Really Fun because they
do it in the belly room,

816
00:21:42,081 --> 00:21:43,250
which is this tiny little room.

817
00:21:43,251 --> 00:21:46,190
They pack it with people and
it's an insult competition,

818
00:21:46,191 --> 00:21:50,540
so right joke writing competition between
two comics and the insult each other

819
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:54,290
and the the audience and the
judges sort of get to decide who,

820
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:57,860
who wrote the better stuff and
they go hard at each other.

821
00:21:57,870 --> 00:21:59,180
They fucking go hard,

822
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:02,530
but somebody wrote an article because a,

823
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:07,310
someone white dropped an end bomb
during during the show and they're like,

824
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:07,671
you know,

825
00:22:07,671 --> 00:22:11,910
are white people getting the n word pass
at the comedy store and they wrote this

826
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,220
already,

827
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,450
like you fucking piece of shit.

828
00:22:14,451 --> 00:22:17,410
Like you know what they're doing
exactly what they're doing.

829
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:18,110
They weren't.

830
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:18,531
First of all,

831
00:22:18,531 --> 00:22:21,390
they weren't calling
someone who was saying like,

832
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,370
this guy's a nigger,

833
00:22:22,371 --> 00:22:22,581
you know,

834
00:22:22,581 --> 00:22:23,570
they weren't doing that.

835
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:27,590
They were using the word in the context
of some sort of a joke and even if.

836
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:28,160
Right.

837
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:28,401
Yeah,

838
00:22:28,401 --> 00:22:33,401
but it was just like the idea that it
can't be done like this is fuck you right

839
00:22:33,411 --> 00:22:35,030
now this it's comedy.

840
00:22:35,031 --> 00:22:37,550
Like there are things
that are said in comedy.

841
00:22:37,551 --> 00:22:37,731
Look,

842
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:37,911
yeah,

843
00:22:37,911 --> 00:22:38,970
in real life,

844
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:39,950
in real speech,

845
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,420
when you're talking to people,

846
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:43,520
it's probably not the best thing to say.

847
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,380
It's probably a rude thing to say,

848
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:46,301
of course,

849
00:22:46,301 --> 00:22:48,970
but as a comedian in a club
doing what you're doing,

850
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:53,650
the only way it's gonna go
away is if you don't fight it,

851
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:54,790
if you don't resist it,

852
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,833
which is difficult,

853
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:57,760
but if they come at you and say,

854
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:58,500
you're,

855
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,830
you're racist for saying this,

856
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:00,760
you just.

857
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,290
The only comment is I'm a comedian,

858
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:03,160
and then that's it.

859
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:03,993
End of story.

860
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:06,010
It's when you fight
back and you give them,

861
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:07,740
you take the bait and it become.

862
00:23:07,741 --> 00:23:10,180
If it fuels it and that's
what's been happening,

863
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,470
so now people think,

864
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:11,651
oh,

865
00:23:11,651 --> 00:23:15,080
I can get this famous guy
to Apollo to apologize,

866
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:16,850
doesn't make news and be a part of it.

867
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,960
Not really fight back,

868
00:23:17,961 --> 00:23:21,080
but really like sort of defend it.

869
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:21,681
I mean,

870
00:23:21,681 --> 00:23:22,650
not even defend it.

871
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:26,090
Apollo fighting back is important I think,

872
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,890
or at least stating your,

873
00:23:27,891 --> 00:23:28,240
your,

874
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,290
your mind speaking your opinion,

875
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:33,050
but this idea of apologizing for jokes,

876
00:23:33,051 --> 00:23:33,750
fuck off

877
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:34,561
those people,

878
00:23:34,561 --> 00:23:36,000
the people who write about it,

879
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:38,550
who are in the audience and taking
a fence in writing that they,

880
00:23:38,551 --> 00:23:42,810
to me are much more
offensive than a comedian.

881
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:43,853
The comedian is.

882
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:44,743
He says this man,

883
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:46,610
his is to make a joke.

884
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,430
That's his job is to make light of things.

885
00:23:49,431 --> 00:23:54,230
And if you're in the audience and you're
calling someone a racist or you're

886
00:23:54,231 --> 00:23:54,951
calling someone,

887
00:23:54,951 --> 00:23:56,810
massage dentist or whatever label,

888
00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:02,020
you are much more violent
than the clown up on stage.

889
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:03,470
Much more violent,

890
00:24:03,471 --> 00:24:04,080
more violent,

891
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,570
and more about your,

892
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:06,560
you're provoking.

893
00:24:06,561 --> 00:24:07,430
You're much more offensive,

894
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:08,390
much more offensive.

895
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,171
But I,

896
00:24:09,171 --> 00:24:09,890
and I,

897
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:14,450
and violence is close to the term
because I did a show for our good friend.

898
00:24:14,451 --> 00:24:15,050
Uh,

899
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:18,680
Greg Fitzsimmons was like a fundraiser
thing for the school thing and I was

900
00:24:18,681 --> 00:24:19,430
talking about,

901
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:22,330
I have this joke in my act
where I say I live in La,

902
00:24:22,331 --> 00:24:22,820
it's a,

903
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,990
it's a horrible school
district that we're,

904
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:29,660
that we live in and either had to pay for
school or pay for guns and Ammo and my

905
00:24:29,661 --> 00:24:31,430
kids have no skills.

906
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:36,430
So I pay for school and the only rule
I have school if I'm going to pay for

907
00:24:36,981 --> 00:24:38,620
school is a,

908
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,880
it cannot be predominantly Asian.

909
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:42,283
Why?

910
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:47,000
Why would I pay all that money for
my kids to be last in everything.

911
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,240
And then I talk about these families,

912
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:51,380
how they're just superior.

913
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:52,640
Asian families are superior.

914
00:24:52,641 --> 00:24:53,361
They work harder.

915
00:24:53,361 --> 00:24:54,171
They want their kids to,

916
00:24:54,171 --> 00:24:55,670
when they play five different instruments.

917
00:24:55,671 --> 00:24:59,840
My kids play the toilet paper roll on
and on and this woman yells out from the

918
00:24:59,841 --> 00:25:00,674
crowd,

919
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,860
get some new material in the middle of it.

920
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:04,880
Everyone else is laughing.

921
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:07,880
Get some new material as.

922
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:08,361
I'm sorry,

923
00:25:08,361 --> 00:25:09,140
what?

924
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:09,531
She goes,

925
00:25:09,531 --> 00:25:10,490
it's racist.

926
00:25:10,491 --> 00:25:11,660
You're a racist,

927
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:13,970
I've never been called
a racist in my life,

928
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,313
and it was like,

929
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:15,921
whoa.

930
00:25:15,921 --> 00:25:20,420
It was kind of like being
punched in the face and I said,

931
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,313
I'm sorry,

932
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:23,410
are you not listening
to the guy next door?

933
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:23,601
He goes,

934
00:25:23,601 --> 00:25:25,640
we're wondering where
you're going with this.

935
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:29,460
The Guy Friend,

936
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:30,853
he's with her,

937
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:31,880
he must be with her.

938
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,100
So I'm leaning on the side,

939
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,210
just stop and lean on the stool.

940
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:36,163
And I said,

941
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,610
where am I going with this?

942
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:41,750
I'm pointing out that a Asian families,

943
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:42,230
uh,

944
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:46,580
work harder than a traditional
American white families.

945
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:50,750
They work harder and hold their kids
to a higher standard and the therefore

946
00:25:50,751 --> 00:25:55,070
they're excelling more in sports and
they're excelling more in schools because

947
00:25:55,071 --> 00:25:55,860
of how they're raising their,

948
00:25:55,860 --> 00:26:00,260
held to these high standards and that
they are actually doing better for their

949
00:26:00,261 --> 00:26:04,400
families and we are giving our kids a
free pass and making sure that they have a

950
00:26:04,401 --> 00:26:04,970
good time.

951
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:08,870
But of course this all would have been
done through jokes and would have been

952
00:26:08,871 --> 00:26:13,220
much more enjoyable experience for the
rest of the audience if you had shut up.

953
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:14,070
I said,

954
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:14,631
I'm sorry,

955
00:26:14,631 --> 00:26:15,231
what part?

956
00:26:15,231 --> 00:26:16,460
Just so I understand

957
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:20,270
what race are you?

958
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:21,350
What part did you,

959
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,280
are you white?

960
00:26:22,281 --> 00:26:24,080
Are You Asian?

961
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:24,921
She goes,

962
00:26:24,921 --> 00:26:25,940
I'm Mexican.

963
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:27,920
I said,

964
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,190
alright,

965
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:29,270
I can't help you.

966
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,260
You're wrong,

967
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,340
and everybody applauded.

968
00:26:31,341 --> 00:26:32,840
The rest of the place applauded,

969
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:36,320
but I mean her calling me a racist.

970
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,251
I'm telling you,

971
00:26:37,251 --> 00:26:37,551
Joe,

972
00:26:37,551 --> 00:26:38,384
I was.

973
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:42,800
I went up and did a Neil Brennan show
after that in Santa Monica and then drove

974
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,010
home to my

975
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:47,850
place in the valley after that
and I was buzzing the whole time,

976
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:49,310
like by the time I got in,

977
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,700
like I was angry,

978
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,370
angry and the end and kind of hurt.

979
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,510
But you went into a moron.

980
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:55,381
I ran into a mormon,

981
00:26:55,381 --> 00:26:57,750
but just that term of
having someone say racist,

982
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:57,981
what?

983
00:26:57,981 --> 00:26:58,800
There's a lot of people

984
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,010
recreationally offended.

985
00:27:00,011 --> 00:27:02,260
They're looking to be offended
whether it makes sense or not,

986
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:02,740
you know?

987
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:04,660
It's like saying black
guys have bigger dicks,

988
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,380
racist writing,

989
00:27:06,381 --> 00:27:07,950
so that was a racist to be awesome.

990
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:09,211
How's it racist?

991
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:10,890
To be better as a racist,

992
00:27:10,891 --> 00:27:11,880
to be better at math.

993
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:14,550
You say the Asians are better
at school because it's racist.

994
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:19,790
It's racist to mock their eyes or say
they were inferior race that's racist,

995
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:25,320
racist to compliment a race
exactly opposite of racist,

996
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:28,050
sort of racist against
your own kids there.

997
00:27:28,051 --> 00:27:32,670
So there was so much fun in a time when
you could just talk about each other and

998
00:27:32,671 --> 00:27:33,450
enjoy it.

999
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:35,940
Like really be like he'd be like,

1000
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:40,080
we were Italian and my friends were
Irish and everybody had their things and

1001
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,350
you're celebrating.

1002
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:42,720
You're celebrating that stuff.

1003
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,390
My parents generation
really celebrated it,

1004
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:46,080
you know,

1005
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:51,080
now you can't even say what they are
without it being perceived as awful.

1006
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,570
I had this Mexican lady yelled at me once.

1007
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,060
I had this joke about,

1008
00:27:56,061 --> 00:27:56,200
uh,

1009
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:56,440
the,

1010
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,050
the,

1011
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:57,500
the,

1012
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,110
the Ufo that supposedly
crashed and Roswell,

1013
00:28:00,111 --> 00:28:02,420
New Mexico in 1947.

1014
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:03,170
There was this,

1015
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:06,260
the cover of the Roswell Times
or whatever the newspaper was.

1016
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,740
I actually have it framed in my house
that the cover of this newspaper,

1017
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:15,020
it said there was a headline that was
like flying disc recovered like that.

1018
00:28:15,381 --> 00:28:16,910
They have flying saucer mean.

1019
00:28:16,911 --> 00:28:18,140
They wrote about it in the paper.

1020
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:23,380
They had these statements from military
people that they had found crashed ufo.

1021
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,320
And then the next day
they came out and said,

1022
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:27,203
sorry,

1023
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:32,390
say the joke was they said they had a
crashed Ufo and alien bodies and then the

1024
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:38,000
next day they came out and they printed
in the paper or they came and had a

1025
00:28:38,001 --> 00:28:38,601
press release.

1026
00:28:38,601 --> 00:28:39,110
It said,

1027
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:40,160
I don't remember how this joke was.

1028
00:28:40,161 --> 00:28:40,994
It was a long time ago.

1029
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:41,750
They said,

1030
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:42,130
oh,

1031
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:42,561
we're sorry.

1032
00:28:42,561 --> 00:28:43,610
It was just a weather balloon.

1033
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:44,721
And I said,

1034
00:28:44,721 --> 00:28:45,980
well what about the aliens?

1035
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,510
Those are Mexicans.

1036
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:48,890
Apparently they were,

1037
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,880
they were on the balloon.

1038
00:28:49,881 --> 00:28:50,601
They thought it was a pen,

1039
00:28:50,601 --> 00:28:51,140
Yada.

1040
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,280
They had been drinking,

1041
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,440
some shenanigans took place.

1042
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:55,880
And this lady was yelling at me,

1043
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:56,743
hey,

1044
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:57,561
I go,

1045
00:28:57,561 --> 00:28:58,394
what did I say?

1046
00:28:58,690 --> 00:28:59,350
And she goes,

1047
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:00,950
because I said the word Mexican,

1048
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,060
I go like alien,

1049
00:29:02,061 --> 00:29:02,870
like another country,

1050
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:04,250
get aliens from another country.

1051
00:29:04,251 --> 00:29:05,084
Illegal aliens.

1052
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:05,983
That's what they're called,

1053
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:07,240
right?

1054
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:07,940
So it's Mexican,

1055
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:08,151
right?

1056
00:29:08,151 --> 00:29:08,571
Exactly.

1057
00:29:08,571 --> 00:29:09,200
But she was like,

1058
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,420
you shouldn't be fucking
to make it fun of Mexicans.

1059
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:13,731
And I was like,

1060
00:29:13,731 --> 00:29:13,941
well,

1061
00:29:13,941 --> 00:29:14,774
why not?

1062
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:15,021
Like,

1063
00:29:15,021 --> 00:29:15,801
what are you saying?

1064
00:29:15,801 --> 00:29:15,951
Like,

1065
00:29:15,951 --> 00:29:16,490
what did I say?

1066
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:17,170
Bad?

1067
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:19,010
Just fucking talking shit.

1068
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:19,790
Like,

1069
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:20,141
oh,

1070
00:29:20,141 --> 00:29:20,510
okay,

1071
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:21,171
you shouldn't be.

1072
00:29:21,171 --> 00:29:22,430
You're too dumb to be here.

1073
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:24,890
They should have made you fill out a
form before you walked through the door.

1074
00:29:24,891 --> 00:29:25,730
You fucking dope.

1075
00:29:25,731 --> 00:29:26,564
Exactly.

1076
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,670
If they were to describe what
was happening in this club,

1077
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:31,370
it was a series of people getting
on stage and talking shit.

1078
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:32,800
The old.

1079
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,370
So we went to this whole
back and forth thing.

1080
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,330
What does this make sense?

1081
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,560
Do Mexicans drink?

1082
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:37,161
Yes,

1083
00:29:37,161 --> 00:29:38,470
they do write everybody.

1084
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,330
A lot of people drink that are Mexicans.

1085
00:29:40,331 --> 00:29:41,164
There's nothing wrong with.

1086
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:42,003
I drink to.

1087
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:44,710
Do Mexicans have a history?

1088
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:45,810
A long history of the pin.

1089
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:46,570
Jada?

1090
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:46,871
Yes,

1091
00:29:46,871 --> 00:29:47,650
they do.

1092
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:48,483
They do.

1093
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,200
They beat those fucking things.

1094
00:29:50,201 --> 00:29:51,160
Candy comes out.

1095
00:29:51,161 --> 00:29:52,320
It's well documented.

1096
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:56,490
Why you talking?

1097
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:57,743
Shit.

1098
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:01,280
Do you think it's going to swing back,

1099
00:30:01,281 --> 00:30:01,820
do you think?

1100
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:02,001
Yeah,

1101
00:30:02,001 --> 00:30:02,600
I hope so.

1102
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:07,310
Don rickles junior's going to show up
and I just think people are just getting

1103
00:30:07,311 --> 00:30:08,600
smarter overall.

1104
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:09,910
More edge I may think.

1105
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:12,320
I think there's always going to be.

1106
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,270
There's no doubt about it that there are
people that's their mind does not work

1107
00:30:17,271 --> 00:30:17,850
as well.

1108
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:20,660
Just like there's kids that are
fucking two and they got big glasses.

1109
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:21,690
What is that?

1110
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:21,880
Well,

1111
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,780
their eyes don't work so fucking good.

1112
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:25,700
Some people are born deaf.

1113
00:30:25,701 --> 00:30:27,050
I have a friend who was born deaf.

1114
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:28,930
There's just the reality of the world.

1115
00:30:28,931 --> 00:30:31,730
There's some people's minds
are just not that good.

1116
00:30:31,731 --> 00:30:32,350
Yeah,

1117
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:32,690
no,

1118
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:32,870
there's.

1119
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:33,170
Yeah,

1120
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:34,200
there's no doubt about it.

1121
00:30:34,201 --> 00:30:34,550
Oh,

1122
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:35,420
it's physical.

1123
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:36,663
It's reality.

1124
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:37,560
Chemical makeup,

1125
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:38,511
big noses.

1126
00:30:38,511 --> 00:30:39,344
Some people.

1127
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,960
Some people are fucking shitty brains.

1128
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:42,520
Right?

1129
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,890
Why are you shitting on?

1130
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,410
There's no way around it,

1131
00:30:49,411 --> 00:30:49,681
man.

1132
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,270
You're always going to get dumb people.

1133
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:51,750
I,

1134
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:52,370
I,

1135
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:53,340
I do this joke

1136
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:57,540
and make fun of Italians,

1137
00:30:57,541 --> 00:30:59,130
which I am recorders.

1138
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:02,150
Italian and I had this guy
yelling at him and it'll fool.

1139
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,050
Can Be shooting on toe and I'm like,

1140
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,850
I'm shitting on my own people.

1141
00:31:05,851 --> 00:31:06,684
Fuck you.

1142
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:07,050
Right?

1143
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:09,630
Like what are you talking
about Mike talking about you?

1144
00:31:09,631 --> 00:31:10,231
Yes I am.

1145
00:31:10,231 --> 00:31:10,860
You know why?

1146
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,890
Because you're doing
exactly what it was saying.

1147
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,353
You're yelling.

1148
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:16,203
Fuck it.

1149
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:22,020
It's just that.

1150
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,130
Those are real people.

1151
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:24,630
It's not all Italians.

1152
00:31:24,631 --> 00:31:25,101
God Damn.

1153
00:31:25,101 --> 00:31:26,040
There's millions of them.

1154
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:30,750
But this whole thing like they're
intelligent people though that kind of

1155
00:31:30,751 --> 00:31:31,441
provoked this.

1156
00:31:31,441 --> 00:31:32,274
Don't you think?

1157
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:37,340
Like there's equal writing editorials
and educated people who want to control

1158
00:31:37,891 --> 00:31:40,050
human behavior by semantics,

1159
00:31:40,051 --> 00:31:40,680
by,

1160
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:45,090
by kind of they're going to set up
their own rules and you're gonna have to

1161
00:31:45,091 --> 00:31:45,924
abide by them.

1162
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:46,201
Well,

1163
00:31:46,201 --> 00:31:48,990
there's a lot of people that are unhappy
and they have a green light to start

1164
00:31:48,991 --> 00:31:49,824
talking shit,

1165
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:53,820
and there's also people that are bloggers
that are looking for a subject that

1166
00:31:53,821 --> 00:31:57,870
they can legitimately find a reason
to attack and they might not.

1167
00:31:57,930 --> 00:31:59,190
If they weren't bloggers,

1168
00:31:59,191 --> 00:32:00,930
they might not have even focused on it,

1169
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,910
but because of the fact
that it's a subject,

1170
00:32:02,911 --> 00:32:03,744
it's like,

1171
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:05,570
do I really give a fuck
about Kim Kardashian?

1172
00:32:05,571 --> 00:32:06,241
And no,

1173
00:32:06,241 --> 00:32:07,074
I do not.

1174
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:08,130
I really don't care.

1175
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,400
But if I'm looking for a joke
and she does something stupid,

1176
00:32:11,401 --> 00:32:11,640
I'm like,

1177
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,001
all right,

1178
00:32:12,001 --> 00:32:12,834
bitch,

1179
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,900
sit down in front of the
computer and I concoct a bit.

1180
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,040
I mean,

1181
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,210
this is life,

1182
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:19,480
this culture,

1183
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,440
that's this.

1184
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:20,731
I mean,

1185
00:32:20,731 --> 00:32:23,370
you can't fault them in some
ways because it is what they do,

1186
00:32:23,371 --> 00:32:26,910
but there's a really asinine
viewpoint when you're,

1187
00:32:26,911 --> 00:32:27,121
you know,

1188
00:32:27,121 --> 00:32:27,450
you're,

1189
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:30,780
you're looking at jokes and you're
trying to pretend that this person is in

1190
00:32:30,781 --> 00:32:34,350
court giving an affidavit and these are
their actual thoughts on these subjects.

1191
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:35,543
You know,

1192
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:36,541
there's got to be.

1193
00:32:36,541 --> 00:32:37,380
And I think it's,

1194
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:38,390
I think that's the,

1195
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:41,120
just the responsibility of the
comedians at the end of the day.

1196
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:42,560
You've just got to stick to it.

1197
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:43,101
Well,

1198
00:32:43,101 --> 00:32:44,480
do you remember when patrice o neal,

1199
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:45,770
he was on this thing.

1200
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:49,880
It was a Fox News show and it was
back when opie and Anthony got fired.

1201
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:51,530
They got suspended I guess,

1202
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,980
and he said he was a
really important point.

1203
00:32:54,981 --> 00:32:59,981
You said jokes that you are offended by
and jokes that you love all come from

1204
00:33:00,141 --> 00:33:01,010
the same place.

1205
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:02,720
Someone's just trying to be funny,

1206
00:33:02,721 --> 00:33:05,270
like you don't understand that
because you don't understand funny,

1207
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:06,320
right?

1208
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,110
They're just trying to
make you laugh and some,

1209
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:11,300
some of them hit and some of them
met and that's just the way it goes.

1210
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:16,390
And that's the scary part is that you're
in a club trying to make it hit and as

1211
00:33:16,611 --> 00:33:19,970
you're working out material
you'll say stuff just working.

1212
00:33:19,971 --> 00:33:24,410
It's going to take six months before
this joke is even ready and people are

1213
00:33:24,411 --> 00:33:27,980
taping you two weeks in when it's ugly
and you don't really know what you're

1214
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:28,820
saying.

1215
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:29,690
Blurting stuff out.

1216
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:30,800
That's dangerous.

1217
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:30,981
Well,

1218
00:33:30,981 --> 00:33:33,110
you know Chris Rock has
that world famous joke,

1219
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:35,900
one of his best jokes ever
that I love black people,

1220
00:33:35,901 --> 00:33:36,734
but I hate niggers.

1221
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:37,930
It was a bit.

1222
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:42,380
Well apparently Louis told me
that that bit took a year to work.

1223
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,041
Oh yeah.

1224
00:33:43,041 --> 00:33:44,450
He used to bomb.

1225
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:46,010
It just wasn't working.

1226
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:49,970
And if someone had been the
audience youtubing that at
the beginning when it was

1227
00:33:49,971 --> 00:33:51,470
eating Dick Stage,

1228
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,810
he would have looked like
an asshole right now.

1229
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:54,311
Yeah.

1230
00:33:54,311 --> 00:33:55,101
And tell people no,

1231
00:33:55,101 --> 00:33:56,060
just stick with me.

1232
00:33:56,061 --> 00:33:56,661
It's going to be funny.

1233
00:33:56,661 --> 00:33:59,150
At one point talking about
it and not only that,

1234
00:33:59,151 --> 00:34:01,100
but their joke gets released.

1235
00:34:01,101 --> 00:34:02,970
It gets online and it's like,

1236
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:07,190
which is really kind of a violation of
what a comic is doing by working out a

1237
00:34:07,191 --> 00:34:07,750
set.

1238
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,050
If you see someone at the seller,

1239
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,580
if you see someone at the comedy store,

1240
00:34:10,581 --> 00:34:11,414
at the Improv,

1241
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,040
most of the time,

1242
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:15,410
most of the time you see a
comedian like you are like me.

1243
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,940
We're working out stuff.

1244
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,040
That's what we're doing.

1245
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:19,190
This is our gym.

1246
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:20,660
It's our workshop.

1247
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:21,740
It's how these things.

1248
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:22,310
When you.

1249
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:26,210
When you see it on comedy central
or if you see it in a headline club,

1250
00:34:26,211 --> 00:34:28,250
you see what the Irvine
Improv on a weekend.

1251
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,290
Then you're seeing essentially
a finished product,

1252
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:32,180
but all that other stuff is like,

1253
00:34:32,181 --> 00:34:33,680
that's how bits get work done.

1254
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:38,240
We need an audience and I've done a lot
of them that don't fucking own man and

1255
00:34:38,241 --> 00:34:39,260
then one day they do.

1256
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:44,290
Have you ever been on stage doing this
stupid set in town and just say something

1257
00:34:44,661 --> 00:34:45,231
completely,

1258
00:34:45,231 --> 00:34:48,440
just come to you like that retard or mean.

1259
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:51,740
I said something horrible about
my wife's tits or something.

1260
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:55,520
It just kind of blurted it
out like I don't think that.

1261
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:57,290
I'm just trying to be funny.

1262
00:34:57,850 --> 00:34:58,130
Right,

1263
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:58,581
exactly.

1264
00:34:58,581 --> 00:35:02,270
You're just spitball and you're trying
to and people will get angry at you about

1265
00:35:02,271 --> 00:35:03,830
the contents of your imagination.

1266
00:35:03,831 --> 00:35:04,820
It's like you don't understand,

1267
00:35:04,821 --> 00:35:05,654
this is not,

1268
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:07,970
this is performance,

1269
00:35:07,971 --> 00:35:12,830
this is not me as a human being given
you my well thought out and clearly

1270
00:35:12,831 --> 00:35:14,510
analyzed views on life,

1271
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:15,140
right?

1272
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:15,320
I'm.

1273
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:15,590
Look,

1274
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:16,460
if you're a writer,

1275
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,510
any great writer,

1276
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:19,340
greatest of the greats,

1277
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:20,210
take updike,

1278
00:35:20,211 --> 00:35:22,370
whoever you,

1279
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:23,900
when you read their stuff,

1280
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:25,400
you're not reading a first draft,

1281
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:27,350
you're reading the 50th draft,

1282
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:32,290
them going to work on this thing and a
comedian is showing you as first draft

1283
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:32,960
every time,

1284
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,250
every time he's up there,

1285
00:35:34,251 --> 00:35:38,070
like until you go see those big
shows already should fear has quote

1286
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:41,130
that he has taped above his
keyboard from hemingway,

1287
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,950
says the first draft
of everything is Shit.

1288
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:45,023
It's great.

1289
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,110
It means everything.

1290
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:47,940
It means everything already.

1291
00:35:47,941 --> 00:35:49,110
Lang got in trouble recently.

1292
00:35:49,111 --> 00:35:50,430
I don't know if you've
been paying attention,

1293
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:51,691
paying attention to that.

1294
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:51,841
Yeah.

1295
00:35:51,841 --> 00:35:52,170
Yeah.

1296
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:53,003
I saw him.

1297
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:57,540
I saw him right after he had this joke
that we do on stage at the cellar where

1298
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,920
he said that,

1299
00:35:58,930 --> 00:35:59,763
uh,

1300
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:03,480
all this ferguson stuff is
really starting to fuck with my,

1301
00:36:03,481 --> 00:36:04,314
um,

1302
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,430
my personal life.

1303
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:06,613
And he said,

1304
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:07,060
no,

1305
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:09,720
all these protests are really starting
to fuck with my personal life,

1306
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:12,300
and those are the other day I'm
having sex with this black chick.

1307
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:13,410
And she goes,

1308
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:14,430
I can't breathe.

1309
00:36:14,431 --> 00:36:14,791
And he goes,

1310
00:36:14,791 --> 00:36:15,001
hey,

1311
00:36:15,001 --> 00:36:16,710
let's not bring politics into the bedroom.

1312
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:22,790
Funny jokes,

1313
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:27,320
but it was too soon and some
woman got up and yelled out,

1314
00:36:27,321 --> 00:36:28,580
that shit ain't funny.

1315
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:29,600
And uh,

1316
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:33,560
she started tweeting about it and I went
to her twitter page and just fucking

1317
00:36:33,561 --> 00:36:36,410
followed it like a hawk because
I thought it was fascinating.

1318
00:36:36,411 --> 00:36:37,710
And she was getting all these people.

1319
00:36:37,711 --> 00:36:40,730
There were social justice warrior
activists that were gonna.

1320
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,160
They were gonna protest
at the comedy cellar.

1321
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:45,930
We're going to show up at his clubs
were going to follow him around.

1322
00:36:45,931 --> 00:36:46,160
Yeah.

1323
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:46,940
Hilarious.

1324
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:47,720
Oh my God.

1325
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:47,840
No.

1326
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,800
Was with him at the cellar.

1327
00:36:48,801 --> 00:36:50,330
We were sitting at the table upstairs.

1328
00:36:50,331 --> 00:36:50,761
What did he say?

1329
00:36:50,761 --> 00:36:51,620
And he was talking,

1330
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:52,730
it was before that.

1331
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,650
He was talking about the espn one.

1332
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:55,191
Oh,

1333
00:36:55,191 --> 00:36:55,851
that was another one.

1334
00:36:55,851 --> 00:36:56,111
He did?

1335
00:36:56,111 --> 00:36:56,480
Yeah,

1336
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,313
about that.

1337
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:00,320
Which we've read online or read on air.

1338
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:01,810
He was hilarious.

1339
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,070
And then he's going on about that.

1340
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:05,330
And then two days later,

1341
00:37:05,331 --> 00:37:06,164
the other one,

1342
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:08,090
and then I was just looking,

1343
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,780
I thought I was looking up the espn one.

1344
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:10,581
I was so confused.

1345
00:37:10,581 --> 00:37:10,970
I'm like,

1346
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:11,630
wait,

1347
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:13,580
this is a totally new one.

1348
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,473
But it was so great.

1349
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:15,343
He didn't stop.

1350
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:16,160
He just put it out.

1351
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,090
He just kept going.

1352
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:17,410
Yeah,

1353
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:17,720
he will.

1354
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,490
He's doing what he's doing.

1355
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,010
I mean,

1356
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:20,843
todd,

1357
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:24,050
I'm good buddies with Daniel Tosh and he,

1358
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:25,453
uh,

1359
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,700
he does a lot of stuff on the
show that people would be like,

1360
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:32,060
that's racist or you're talking about
black people just because he's big and

1361
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:33,530
black audiences love him.

1362
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,670
Black Comedians love him.

1363
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:36,560
And then other people come
up Mexicans and stuff.

1364
00:37:36,561 --> 00:37:36,681
Like,

1365
00:37:36,681 --> 00:37:38,090
why don't you ever mess with us?

1366
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:42,500
Because they know it's a joke and it's
funny to laugh at yourself and it's his

1367
00:37:42,501 --> 00:37:43,334
style.

1368
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:46,630
It's once people sort of
accept that that's your stuff.

1369
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:48,140
You're an insult comedian,

1370
00:37:48,141 --> 00:37:48,600
right?

1371
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,231
And you know,

1372
00:37:49,231 --> 00:37:50,041
the guys are,

1373
00:37:50,041 --> 00:37:50,401
you know,

1374
00:37:50,401 --> 00:37:51,480
that he's not a bad guy.

1375
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:54,750
Like sorta like what people
want Jeff Ross to roast them.

1376
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,810
If you ask Jeff Ross to Rosie,

1377
00:37:57,020 --> 00:38:00,780
you're asking him to start insulting
you mean that's what he does.

1378
00:38:00,781 --> 00:38:01,620
Everybody knows that

1379
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,120
I worked with the wrinkles the summer.

1380
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:04,930
Oh,

1381
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:05,670
so great.

1382
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:06,503
Where did you work with them?

1383
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:07,443
I went to a,

1384
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:08,283
in Montreal.

1385
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:10,690
He was doing like when the
big gala shows staying,

1386
00:38:10,691 --> 00:38:11,524
doing two nights.

1387
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,020
So he is doing stand
up just doing standup.

1388
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:14,641
Wow.

1389
00:38:14,641 --> 00:38:16,210
And how much time did he do?

1390
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,610
He did about probably like 45.

1391
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:20,470
Oh yeah.

1392
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,250
Whoa.

1393
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:22,240
What was that like?

1394
00:38:22,241 --> 00:38:24,520
And then we get through a couple
of songs in and stuff like that.

1395
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:26,080
He said was it was the greatest.

1396
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:26,250
Yeah,

1397
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:27,520
he sings this song at the end.

1398
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:28,653
Was he saying about.

1399
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:29,171
It's like,

1400
00:38:29,171 --> 00:38:32,050
this one's not thanks for the memories,

1401
00:38:32,051 --> 00:38:32,970
but it's something like that,

1402
00:38:32,971 --> 00:38:33,100
you know,

1403
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:33,970
like see a little,

1404
00:38:33,971 --> 00:38:34,900
you know that a little,

1405
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:36,100
like a little heartfelt

1406
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:37,081
oh,

1407
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:39,850
to try to warm you up after you
shit in your mouth for an hour.

1408
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:41,613
Exactly,

1409
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:42,391
exactly.

1410
00:38:42,391 --> 00:38:43,224
We all love each other.

1411
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,673
And uh,

1412
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:45,161
I,

1413
00:38:45,161 --> 00:38:45,521
you know,

1414
00:38:45,521 --> 00:38:45,850
I,

1415
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:50,850
I didn't get to meet dangerfield
and I Miss Carlin and I was like,

1416
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:56,560
I just want to work with wrinkles at some
point and then it came up that I could

1417
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:59,800
work with them at in Montreal and I
was supposed to go on vacation with my

1418
00:38:59,801 --> 00:39:02,050
family and I literally
sent my wife and kids.

1419
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:02,771
I'm like,

1420
00:39:02,771 --> 00:39:03,220
I'm going meet up,

1421
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:05,830
I'm going to be three days
late to our family vacation.

1422
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:07,330
I'm going to go work with wrinkles.

1423
00:39:07,331 --> 00:39:07,831
I had to,

1424
00:39:07,831 --> 00:39:08,230
it was like,

1425
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:08,720
this is,

1426
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,070
yeah,

1427
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:11,070
it's a comic that's an opportunity.

1428
00:39:11,071 --> 00:39:12,490
It's really hard to pass.

1429
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:13,920
So I went up and uh,

1430
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:17,470
and worked with him and
it was so great to see.

1431
00:39:17,471 --> 00:39:17,681
I mean,

1432
00:39:17,681 --> 00:39:20,150
his references are so date.

1433
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:20,590
It's like,

1434
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:22,810
look at the Puerto Rican guy who was
gonna come at me with a switchblade

1435
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,100
switchblades what do you,

1436
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:27,163
what do you,

1437
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:28,930
what does the switch flip people,

1438
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:30,190
friend of my Puerto Rican,

1439
00:39:30,191 --> 00:39:30,431
they're like,

1440
00:39:30,431 --> 00:39:34,180
what does a switchblade switch
blade will Puerto Rican.

1441
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,020
It's like,

1442
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:36,820
it used to be like a,

1443
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,650
like almost like a negative term,

1444
00:39:38,651 --> 00:39:39,031
but it doesn't,

1445
00:39:39,031 --> 00:39:39,880
it's not anymore.

1446
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:40,470
Right.

1447
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:40,820
You know,

1448
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:43,020
it's like you can't call
someone a Puerto Rican anymore,

1449
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:43,751
like,

1450
00:39:43,751 --> 00:39:43,961
you know,

1451
00:39:43,961 --> 00:39:46,900
it's like calling someone
French from France.

1452
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:47,823
What does that mean?

1453
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:48,850
Are you from England?

1454
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,093
I don't get it,

1455
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:51,730
but his thing was he was.

1456
00:39:51,731 --> 00:39:52,540
So,

1457
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:53,950
he's such a history of it.

1458
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:54,310
Yeah.

1459
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:57,730
Everybody knows this is what he
does and he does this kind of thing.

1460
00:39:57,731 --> 00:39:59,650
So was he working the
crowd the entire time?

1461
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:00,321
Yeah,

1462
00:40:00,321 --> 00:40:01,154
it was kind of a,

1463
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,390
it was kind of a mix.

1464
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,530
Like he uh,

1465
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,790
he brought people up.

1466
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:05,811
He definitely,

1467
00:40:05,811 --> 00:40:07,580
I think when people on stage
for a couple of people,

1468
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:09,080
two guys on stage,

1469
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:09,730
wow.

1470
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:11,840
Not Walking very well.

1471
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:14,870
He doesn't walk very well know that
something's happened to his knee or

1472
00:40:14,871 --> 00:40:16,500
something and uh,

1473
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:17,900
it's amazing.

1474
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:22,100
You have all these show girls go up on
stage and they do this big dance in the

1475
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:23,330
beginning of the show and they
do like the feather thing,

1476
00:40:23,331 --> 00:40:23,750
you know,

1477
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:25,190
they all stand there with the feathers,

1478
00:40:25,191 --> 00:40:26,120
like a big scrim.

1479
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:30,860
And then they wheeled him out and put
them up on a stool and then they all part

1480
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:32,360
and there's Don rickles.

1481
00:40:32,361 --> 00:40:35,780
He just appeared to see
them walking and then he,

1482
00:40:35,781 --> 00:40:36,560
uh,

1483
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:36,890
you know,

1484
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:37,820
look at the black guy over there,

1485
00:40:37,821 --> 00:40:38,570
look at that,

1486
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:42,360
look at the [inaudible] over there and
was doing the Hitler and crazy stuff.

1487
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:43,971
It was great.

1488
00:40:43,971 --> 00:40:44,511
But he's just,

1489
00:40:44,511 --> 00:40:44,721
you know,

1490
00:40:44,721 --> 00:40:46,220
you know the guy so well,

1491
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:47,630
you just know who he is.

1492
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:48,583
So he,

1493
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:48,980
you know,

1494
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:51,710
it's not coming from hate
just as playful kind of guy.

1495
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:52,730
And it was like,

1496
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:57,040
I hope that there's somebody that's
going to be like that for our generation.

1497
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:58,080
Should be somebody.

1498
00:40:58,150 --> 00:40:58,931
I think so.

1499
00:40:58,931 --> 00:41:00,610
I think like what you
were saying about Tosh,

1500
00:41:00,611 --> 00:41:02,170
what we were saying about Jeff Ross,

1501
00:41:02,171 --> 00:41:03,880
like once you know what they do,

1502
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:07,020
if you just have to know what they do
and you know there's going to be building

1503
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:07,530
complained,

1504
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:08,380
but it doesn't matter.

1505
00:41:08,381 --> 00:41:09,214
They get,

1506
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:10,240
they get ignored,

1507
00:41:10,241 --> 00:41:13,590
they get marginalized and you're
allowed to not like somebody managed.

1508
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,390
People just don't like all
sorts of folks that I enjoy.

1509
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:20,350
My whole objective those two days
was I just want to be shit on by him.

1510
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:24,780
I was just lobbing stuff in like don.

1511
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:25,240
Um,

1512
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,073
so uh,

1513
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:28,030
but we're working together two nights,

1514
00:41:28,031 --> 00:41:29,040
so like you know,

1515
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:30,490
after that we're going to
know each other pretty well.

1516
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,450
You think when we get back to la,

1517
00:41:31,451 --> 00:41:32,284
we're going to hang out,

1518
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:33,833
don't push it.

1519
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,780
Then I'm like waiting for them
with just totally that I liked.

1520
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,340
Are you gonna Watch my act in height.

1521
00:41:40,341 --> 00:41:41,210
I really appreciate it.

1522
00:41:41,211 --> 00:41:42,044
If you watch my act,

1523
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:43,580
I had my little busy

1524
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:46,930
after the show.

1525
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:51,170
I go back to his dressing room when
the cool thing was you would love it.

1526
00:41:51,171 --> 00:41:52,004
He just,

1527
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:55,190
it's like old school show business
just walked into the building.

1528
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:55,911
It's like,

1529
00:41:55,911 --> 00:41:56,121
you know,

1530
00:41:56,121 --> 00:41:59,870
even in Montreal it was kind of thing
is everyone's doing shows all week when

1531
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:04,220
hit when it was his time for the show
guys in Tuxedos or walking around.

1532
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:09,380
Security guys are hanging out old school
guys with like gel in their hair and

1533
00:42:09,381 --> 00:42:11,180
like show businesses happening.

1534
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:11,511
This is,

1535
00:42:11,511 --> 00:42:15,170
the halls are cleared and
it's like this is just music,

1536
00:42:15,171 --> 00:42:16,460
classy music playing.

1537
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:16,911
And it's like,

1538
00:42:16,911 --> 00:42:17,061
no,

1539
00:42:17,061 --> 00:42:17,894
we're doing a show.

1540
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:20,450
Not Walking in and just gotten up on.

1541
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:20,750
No,

1542
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:21,800
this is a show.

1543
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:23,293
So great.

1544
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:25,340
So at the end I go to his dressing room,

1545
00:42:25,341 --> 00:42:26,540
he's in his dressing room in a,

1546
00:42:26,541 --> 00:42:27,680
in a silver,

1547
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:28,940
like silk robe.

1548
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,560
These little slippers.

1549
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,350
This is post your slippers,

1550
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:34,430
slippers,

1551
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:38,150
gold stuff on the toes and he's
got all the makings for Martinis.

1552
00:42:38,151 --> 00:42:38,641
Got The ice,

1553
00:42:38,641 --> 00:42:40,040
has got the olives.

1554
00:42:40,041 --> 00:42:40,761
It's got the glass,

1555
00:42:40,761 --> 00:42:41,330
the shake,

1556
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:42,980
but he just shoves it on his glass.

1557
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,150
He just puts it all.

1558
00:42:44,151 --> 00:42:44,811
It doesn't even shake.

1559
00:42:44,811 --> 00:42:48,380
It just puts ice olives and vodka and
you sitting there drinking it and I go

1560
00:42:48,381 --> 00:42:49,640
back to see him.

1561
00:42:50,090 --> 00:42:50,870
He's like,

1562
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:51,560
Tom,

1563
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:52,070
come here.

1564
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:53,100
He holds my holds.

1565
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,290
My hand doesn't let go of my hand.

1566
00:42:54,291 --> 00:42:55,160
It's just the greatest.

1567
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:56,030
And he was like,

1568
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:56,780
Tom,

1569
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:57,770
I watched your show tonight.

1570
00:42:58,010 --> 00:42:59,060
I've watched the whole thing.

1571
00:42:59,350 --> 00:42:59,630
Oh,

1572
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:00,171
thank you don.

1573
00:43:00,171 --> 00:43:01,004
Thank you.

1574
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:03,710
Have you considered a
career in grocery delivery?

1575
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:07,580
You go around and deliver food
and you make people happy.

1576
00:43:07,581 --> 00:43:09,800
Throw in a joke once in a while to
keep yourself from killing yourself.

1577
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:14,750
Like this is better
than the whole vacation.

1578
00:43:14,751 --> 00:43:16,490
I'm about to go on with my family.

1579
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:18,190
So much better that.

1580
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,130
Did you put pictures?

1581
00:43:19,131 --> 00:43:19,770
Did you take pictures?

1582
00:43:19,770 --> 00:43:21,140
And I got a couple shots.

1583
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:21,890
That's huge.

1584
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:22,150
Oh,

1585
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:23,120
was just the best.

1586
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:26,150
That's the best guy has
been added for forever.

1587
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:27,183
Yeah.

1588
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:28,053
I never met him.

1589
00:43:28,090 --> 00:43:29,230
I would love to meet that guy.

1590
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:29,861
It's a good one.

1591
00:43:29,861 --> 00:43:31,450
I never got a chance to meet Dangerfield,

1592
00:43:31,451 --> 00:43:33,040
but I stood next to him a couple times.

1593
00:43:33,041 --> 00:43:33,720
He did?

1594
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:34,140
Yeah.

1595
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:34,361
Yeah.

1596
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:36,220
He was doing some sets at the,

1597
00:43:36,221 --> 00:43:36,820
um,

1598
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:38,620
at the laugh factory before he died,

1599
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:43,330
like a and he performed up until
just a few years before he passed.

1600
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:45,250
And in the nineties,

1601
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:48,340
similar around the mid to late nineties,

1602
00:43:48,341 --> 00:43:51,940
he was doing sets occasionally he would
drop in the laugh factory and I was

1603
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,310
really fortunate to be there
a couple times when he did.

1604
00:43:54,610 --> 00:43:55,443
Did he live out here?

1605
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:56,141
Um,

1606
00:43:56,141 --> 00:43:56,771
I don't know.

1607
00:43:56,771 --> 00:43:58,370
I bet he probably lived a couple places.

1608
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,320
It was pretty wealthy.

1609
00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:00,363
Um,

1610
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:00,821
he,

1611
00:44:00,821 --> 00:44:01,390
um,

1612
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:02,141
why don't you meet them though?

1613
00:44:02,141 --> 00:44:02,990
You were standing next to him.

1614
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:04,690
I was young and stupid and I didn't.

1615
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:05,710
I wasn't good enough.

1616
00:44:06,130 --> 00:44:08,340
I didn't feel like it was good
enough to introduce myself to him,

1617
00:44:08,790 --> 00:44:13,390
that I was next to him once when I was
an open mic or I just didn't feel like I

1618
00:44:13,391 --> 00:44:14,740
can introduce myself to them.

1619
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:15,820
Just wasn't good enough.

1620
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:18,730
Is it crazy to think there's some
kids standing next to you now?

1621
00:44:18,731 --> 00:44:19,780
Like I just can't.

1622
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:22,300
I just can't kid say high.

1623
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:23,890
Especially if you're a comic,

1624
00:44:23,891 --> 00:44:24,920
I'll talk to you know,

1625
00:44:25,270 --> 00:44:26,103
but there was a.

1626
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:28,500
there's a couple moments
where you're like,

1627
00:44:28,530 --> 00:44:31,340
I saw Hicks live really two,

1628
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:31,950
three,

1629
00:44:31,950 --> 00:44:33,000
three or four times,

1630
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:36,120
probably three or four times
at least three times in Boston.

1631
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:36,560
Three.

1632
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,400
And that was a raw open miker.

1633
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:42,230
Like I had been doing comedy maybe six
months and I got a chance to see Hicks a

1634
00:44:42,231 --> 00:44:42,901
bunch of times.

1635
00:44:42,901 --> 00:44:43,880
She has time.

1636
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:44,723
It was awesome.

1637
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:45,520
How good was he?

1638
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:46,270
He was amazing,

1639
00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:47,010
man.

1640
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:47,730
It's amazing.

1641
00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:47,951
Yeah,

1642
00:44:47,951 --> 00:44:49,020
it just like the late eighties.

1643
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:53,010
He was probably in his prime.

1644
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:57,360
He died in [inaudible] 93 or 94.

1645
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:58,194
He died.

1646
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:00,300
So I saw him when he was hopping.

1647
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:00,541
I mean,

1648
00:45:00,541 --> 00:45:01,021
it was just,

1649
00:45:01,021 --> 00:45:01,950
he was on fire,

1650
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:02,580
man.

1651
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:03,450
He was so good.

1652
00:45:03,690 --> 00:45:06,960
I remember seeing him and I never saw
them live in some caroline's comedy hour

1653
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:10,620
and just seeing how he was just
like at the edge of the stage,

1654
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:14,720
cigarette in his hand is thinking
some guy's face like I was like,

1655
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:15,421
what the hell.

1656
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:18,540
This has been interesting to see how he
evolved and grew because he was still

1657
00:45:18,541 --> 00:45:19,374
young,

1658
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:19,710
you know,

1659
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:21,420
he was like 32 or something like that.

1660
00:45:21,421 --> 00:45:22,254
When he died,

1661
00:45:23,350 --> 00:45:24,570
he would have gotten a lot better.

1662
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:26,550
It makes you seem so much older.

1663
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:27,210
Well,

1664
00:45:27,210 --> 00:45:29,640
it makes you seem so
much more legendary to.

1665
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:30,270
Yeah.

1666
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:30,931
That's the other thing.

1667
00:45:30,931 --> 00:45:32,010
When someone dies,

1668
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:35,060
like everything that they did become
so much more important than when it.

1669
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,630
If they'd stayed alive.

1670
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:36,900
Yeah,

1671
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:37,733
absolutely.

1672
00:45:37,770 --> 00:45:39,570
Like if Elvis was still alive today.

1673
00:45:40,870 --> 00:45:41,703
Oh

1674
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:43,690
yeah.

1675
00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:44,700
You just wrap it up.

1676
00:45:44,830 --> 00:45:45,390
Yeah.

1677
00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:45,830
Right.

1678
00:45:45,830 --> 00:45:49,380
I mean like John Lennon and there's
so much more valued by most people.

1679
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:50,250
Then Paul Mccartney.

1680
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:50,720
Yeah.

1681
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:51,090
You know,

1682
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:51,841
because Paul is showing up,

1683
00:45:51,841 --> 00:45:53,130
it would award shows and he's like,

1684
00:45:53,131 --> 00:45:53,461
hi,

1685
00:45:53,461 --> 00:45:56,940
I'm still alive and we
get it when you're dead.

1686
00:45:56,941 --> 00:45:58,440
We're gonna fucking love you dude.

1687
00:45:59,010 --> 00:45:59,843
Completely.

1688
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:02,460
I saw dangerfield when I was working,

1689
00:46:02,461 --> 00:46:02,791
actually,

1690
00:46:02,791 --> 00:46:03,990
before I was ever a comic.

1691
00:46:03,991 --> 00:46:05,130
I got a chance to see I.

1692
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:07,110
I worked at a concert place.

1693
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:07,660
Oh yeah.

1694
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:11,420
And I was backstage because there was a
security guard and I was working in this

1695
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:16,140
backstage area where I got
to see dangerfield walking
around behind the stage

1696
00:46:16,141 --> 00:46:19,710
with his bathrobe on his slippers
and that's where he was performing.

1697
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:22,620
He would perform in a
bathrobe in the bathroom.

1698
00:46:22,621 --> 00:46:23,910
He'd gone totally naked,

1699
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:26,550
which throw a bathrobe on and just go on.

1700
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:27,200
Yup,

1701
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:27,800
Yup.

1702
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,760
He went through a period of time.

1703
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:31,680
That's how he was performing.

1704
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:32,611
That's crazy.

1705
00:46:32,611 --> 00:46:32,821
Yeah.

1706
00:46:32,821 --> 00:46:34,110
When I saw them at the laugh factory,

1707
00:46:34,111 --> 00:46:35,160
he was fully dressed,

1708
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:37,830
but he was doing this
place called great woods.

1709
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:40,290
It's a concert place in Mansfield,

1710
00:46:40,291 --> 00:46:41,124
Massachusetts.

1711
00:46:41,490 --> 00:46:43,530
And this was the height of his popularity.

1712
00:46:43,531 --> 00:46:48,531
This was like back to school during
those days because this is like the

1713
00:46:48,541 --> 00:46:49,141
eighties,

1714
00:46:49,141 --> 00:46:52,220
I want to say like 86 or something
like before I did comedy,

1715
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:53,340
that was probably 19,

1716
00:46:53,341 --> 00:46:55,770
so it must've been about 86 and uh,

1717
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:59,160
he was just walking
around with a bathrobe on.

1718
00:46:59,161 --> 00:47:01,590
It would show shuffle
on stage with slippers.

1719
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:03,660
I've got no respect that respect at all.

1720
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:07,380
My wife will tell you and
you're just carrying the drink.

1721
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:08,641
I don't remember.

1722
00:47:08,641 --> 00:47:09,361
It was carrying a drink.

1723
00:47:09,361 --> 00:47:09,901
I just remember,

1724
00:47:09,901 --> 00:47:12,360
look at this bad motherfucker
wearing a bathrobe.

1725
00:47:12,361 --> 00:47:15,600
It's crazy and everybody wanted to talk
about the fact that it had nothing on

1726
00:47:15,601 --> 00:47:16,434
under the bathroom.

1727
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:18,271
The bathroom.

1728
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:19,104
He's totally naked.

1729
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:20,123
I saw his balls,

1730
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:21,630
like he would just walk around.

1731
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:22,201
Is that him?

1732
00:47:22,201 --> 00:47:22,321
Yeah,

1733
00:47:22,321 --> 00:47:23,040
there's that,

1734
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:26,100
that there's a lot of photos of him where
you could actually see as Dick because

1735
00:47:26,101 --> 00:47:28,230
he's a sitting weird and
his dick hanging out.

1736
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:30,843
Yeah,

1737
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:32,940
he gave us Zeros.

1738
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:35,023
That's like,

1739
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:35,660
you know,

1740
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:37,170
it's so weird to bring
up his name and his.

1741
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:39,980
Because the context is we're
never like cosby went through.

1742
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:44,480
He just come out in like sweatpants
and a thing and with socks.

1743
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:45,380
Just socks.

1744
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:45,890
Really?

1745
00:47:45,890 --> 00:47:46,131
Yeah.

1746
00:47:46,131 --> 00:47:49,550
Just come out with like birkenstocks
and take them off and just just.

1747
00:47:49,610 --> 00:47:50,370
Yeah,

1748
00:47:50,370 --> 00:47:52,310
well he wears everything
else was in crowd.

1749
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:53,550
Were they a,

1750
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:57,840
a sweatshirt on it says hello
friends or hello friend.

1751
00:47:57,930 --> 00:47:58,361
Really?

1752
00:47:58,361 --> 00:47:59,850
That's what he wears
when he goes on stage.

1753
00:47:59,851 --> 00:48:01,830
Now he's got this sweatshirt on.

1754
00:48:01,831 --> 00:48:03,270
It's just hello friend.

1755
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:04,650
Yeah,

1756
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:06,000
I guess you just do it so long.

1757
00:48:06,001 --> 00:48:06,834
You just like,

1758
00:48:07,530 --> 00:48:08,160
I guess,

1759
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:08,670
right?

1760
00:48:08,670 --> 00:48:11,940
I mean the balls of that
guy to still do shows.

1761
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:13,710
This is going down.

1762
00:48:14,310 --> 00:48:15,100
I now.

1763
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,500
Do you think it goes online?

1764
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:19,773
No,

1765
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:20,921
no.

1766
00:48:20,921 --> 00:48:21,850
I think he had people that.

1767
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:22,181
Right?

1768
00:48:22,181 --> 00:48:24,550
Because remember when he put up that meme,

1769
00:48:24,551 --> 00:48:25,384
they were like,

1770
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:26,270
yeah,

1771
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:27,200
blew up in his face.

1772
00:48:27,230 --> 00:48:27,471
See,

1773
00:48:27,471 --> 00:48:29,520
I have my own theories about that meme,

1774
00:48:29,521 --> 00:48:29,991
man.

1775
00:48:29,991 --> 00:48:32,120
I think that somebody who works for him,

1776
00:48:32,130 --> 00:48:34,040
he knew what the fuck was going to happen.

1777
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:35,390
Oh yeah.

1778
00:48:35,391 --> 00:48:35,970
That's my,

1779
00:48:35,970 --> 00:48:36,801
my feeling.

1780
00:48:36,801 --> 00:48:37,634
One hundred percent.

1781
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,590
And they just did it to get them.

1782
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:39,951
Yeah.

1783
00:48:39,951 --> 00:48:42,740
I think that anybody who works in tech,

1784
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:44,840
anybody who designed to websites,

1785
00:48:44,870 --> 00:48:46,010
you're savvy,

1786
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:47,690
Internet savvy,

1787
00:48:47,691 --> 00:48:49,580
and if you're one of those
internet savvy people,

1788
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:51,740
he know what the fuck is gonna happen.

1789
00:48:51,741 --> 00:48:52,990
If you say me,

1790
00:48:53,010 --> 00:48:55,640
me take a picture of him.

1791
00:48:55,930 --> 00:48:56,360
Yeah.

1792
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:57,193
Hat on,

1793
00:48:57,410 --> 00:48:57,711
you know,

1794
00:48:57,711 --> 00:48:59,600
just let them rape jokes fly,

1795
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:00,540
you know?

1796
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:00,870
Do you.

1797
00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:02,460
Do you believe in any of this stuff?

1798
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:04,950
Like the illuminaries hello friend,

1799
00:49:05,190 --> 00:49:06,600
Hollywood illuminati.

1800
00:49:06,690 --> 00:49:07,160
Uh,

1801
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:09,420
like my uber driver was completely.

1802
00:49:09,450 --> 00:49:10,800
He thought for sure that like,

1803
00:49:10,830 --> 00:49:11,161
oh no,

1804
00:49:11,161 --> 00:49:12,730
Hollywood once some out now,

1805
00:49:12,731 --> 00:49:13,770
like he did something,

1806
00:49:13,771 --> 00:49:17,100
he fucked piss somebody off and they're
going after him and he had like this

1807
00:49:17,101 --> 00:49:18,090
whole theory and I'm like,

1808
00:49:18,091 --> 00:49:19,830
that's enough.

1809
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:21,820
You know what I mean?

1810
00:49:22,170 --> 00:49:22,921
It can go away.

1811
00:49:22,921 --> 00:49:23,470
What

1812
00:49:23,470 --> 00:49:25,260
the key is an old heater.

1813
00:49:25,270 --> 00:49:27,370
That sentence is my uber driver

1814
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:31,260
who's not making the
best fucking decisions.

1815
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:35,170
Picking up random
strangers based on an APP.

1816
00:49:35,690 --> 00:49:36,311
Get in my car,

1817
00:49:36,311 --> 00:49:36,760
man.

1818
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:40,510
Let me tell you what I think
about Hollywood and the
elite or what do you do in

1819
00:49:40,511 --> 00:49:41,021
that situation?

1820
00:49:41,021 --> 00:49:44,170
Just kind of agree with them to make
the conversation to get a free ride.

1821
00:49:44,171 --> 00:49:45,004
That's what you do.

1822
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:45,701
Yeah.

1823
00:49:45,701 --> 00:49:49,450
He just had this whole
theory and he connected with
other celebrities that were,

1824
00:49:49,451 --> 00:49:51,430
he thinks like Hollywood's
just done with them.

1825
00:49:51,431 --> 00:49:52,710
So they throw him under the bus.

1826
00:49:53,210 --> 00:49:53,950
He said,

1827
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:54,790
Charlie Sheen,

1828
00:49:55,050 --> 00:49:55,480
oh,

1829
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:56,313
come on,

1830
00:49:57,980 --> 00:50:01,540
Charlie Sheen was on tv
talking about smoking rocks.

1831
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:06,310
And then from then he went to get a deal
with fx that netted him somewhere in

1832
00:50:06,311 --> 00:50:08,860
the neighborhood of $500,000,000.

1833
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,830
The same amount of money.

1834
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:12,360
I mean,

1835
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:13,330
I don't really got him.

1836
00:50:13,870 --> 00:50:15,540
How much did he make off that fx thing?

1837
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:17,470
It was some insane amount of syndication.

1838
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:18,400
It was 100 episodes.

1839
00:50:18,430 --> 00:50:22,120
More than $100,000,000 he made
off of that stupid fx thing.

1840
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:23,710
And it's a terrible show.

1841
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:25,390
Anger management is a Goddamn.

1842
00:50:25,510 --> 00:50:28,040
No one even knows it's on together by

1843
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:30,260
monkeys with head injuries.

1844
00:50:30,290 --> 00:50:31,340
It's awful.

1845
00:50:31,470 --> 00:50:31,910
I mean,

1846
00:50:31,910 --> 00:50:32,661
it's so bad.

1847
00:50:32,661 --> 00:50:34,150
You watched the punchlines like what?

1848
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:34,911
$200,

1849
00:50:34,911 --> 00:50:36,650
million dollar Charlie Sheen experiment.

1850
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:38,090
God,

1851
00:50:38,090 --> 00:50:38,600
come on.

1852
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:38,841
Well,

1853
00:50:38,841 --> 00:50:43,130
they were riding on the waves of
him leaving two and a half men what?

1854
00:50:43,131 --> 00:50:43,470
Look,

1855
00:50:43,470 --> 00:50:44,840
what were the other two and a half men.

1856
00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:47,630
Some fucking executives
that want to be seen.

1857
00:50:47,690 --> 00:50:48,291
Look at me.

1858
00:50:48,291 --> 00:50:49,290
I'm a big shot.

1859
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:52,220
I'm like to do a blow and get hookers,

1860
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:52,461
right?

1861
00:50:52,461 --> 00:50:52,970
Charlie?

1862
00:50:52,970 --> 00:50:53,571
What are we going to make?

1863
00:50:53,571 --> 00:50:54,404
How about a fortune?

1864
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:55,731
Meanwhile,

1865
00:50:55,731 --> 00:50:57,590
you guys fucked up the TV business.

1866
00:50:57,591 --> 00:50:58,424
He'd dumb asses.

1867
00:50:58,760 --> 00:50:59,270
They did.

1868
00:50:59,270 --> 00:51:01,820
They tried to do that deal with a bunch
of other shows to try to do it with

1869
00:51:01,821 --> 00:51:03,770
George Lopez and it fizzled out.

1870
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:04,460
Right?

1871
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:04,611
Well,

1872
00:51:04,611 --> 00:51:04,760
they.

1873
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:07,760
What they did is if you get past
a certain amount of episodes,

1874
00:51:07,761 --> 00:51:09,470
they automatically pick it up for 100.

1875
00:51:10,130 --> 00:51:11,060
Set it at 10.

1876
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:11,720
Yeah.

1877
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:12,770
If you get past 10,

1878
00:51:12,990 --> 00:51:13,700
right,

1879
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:15,200
they automatically pick
it up for the back.

1880
00:51:15,201 --> 00:51:15,990
90.

1881
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:16,520
Yes.

1882
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:17,540
Insane.

1883
00:51:17,570 --> 00:51:18,350
Insane.

1884
00:51:18,350 --> 00:51:22,880
But some dummy agree to that based on the
hype behind Charlie Sheen and the fact

1885
00:51:22,881 --> 00:51:26,030
that he was doing live
shows with no material.

1886
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:26,280
Hey,

1887
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:27,380
I forgot about the live show.

1888
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:29,720
How could you put on.

1889
00:51:29,810 --> 00:51:32,990
One of them was he was a bastard.

1890
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:34,970
That's not.

1891
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:37,820
But then our boy russell saved it.

1892
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:41,450
Russell Peters started doing shows with
them and saved it because Russell's

1893
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:46,100
awesome comedian and started interviewing
Charlie and being funny while he was

1894
00:51:46,101 --> 00:51:46,821
interviewing them.

1895
00:51:46,821 --> 00:51:48,530
So Russell would crack some jokes,

1896
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:49,880
asked some questions,

1897
00:51:49,881 --> 00:51:50,840
crack some more jokes,

1898
00:51:50,930 --> 00:51:52,370
and everybody was entertained by it.

1899
00:51:52,371 --> 00:51:56,510
And then Charlie could tell his crazy
hooker stories in context of like a,

1900
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:56,900
uh,

1901
00:51:56,900 --> 00:52:00,270
like a show Biz set your panel.

1902
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:01,010
Yeah.

1903
00:52:01,010 --> 00:52:02,660
Russell knows how to do theater,

1904
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:02,980
right.

1905
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:04,460
He knows how to entertain these people.

1906
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:06,920
He's acutely aware that all
these folks are watching.

1907
00:52:06,921 --> 00:52:08,000
Whereas Charlie was just like,

1908
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:09,970
I'm just going to go out
there and be Charlie Sheen and

1909
00:52:11,570 --> 00:52:12,201
give us our money.

1910
00:52:12,201 --> 00:52:12,460
He's like,

1911
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:13,293
already got your money.

1912
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:15,073
Remember that?

1913
00:52:15,370 --> 00:52:18,830
Those were awful devastating.

1914
00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:20,230
I mean he,

1915
00:52:20,230 --> 00:52:23,780
he and he was in a panic after that and
that's when they brought in comics and

1916
00:52:23,781 --> 00:52:25,370
started bringing comics
on the road with them.

1917
00:52:25,371 --> 00:52:26,204
And uh,

1918
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:26,751
yeah,

1919
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:29,180
but that was riding the wave of that.

1920
00:52:29,181 --> 00:52:31,760
They did this anger
management thing and you know,

1921
00:52:31,761 --> 00:52:33,830
the first couple episodes
probably weren't so bad,

1922
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:36,770
but it's fucking terrible.

1923
00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:37,971
Yeah.

1924
00:52:37,971 --> 00:52:41,870
So take that aluminum 100 episodes
and it's not even their fault.

1925
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:43,970
They're running 102 a week.

1926
00:52:43,971 --> 00:52:44,450
Yeah.

1927
00:52:44,450 --> 00:52:45,230
So how,

1928
00:52:45,230 --> 00:52:45,640
how,

1929
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:47,510
how much time did they put
into these fucking jokes?

1930
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:49,040
You can have almost none.

1931
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:49,970
Almost no time.

1932
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:50,871
There's hardly any time.

1933
00:52:50,871 --> 00:52:51,770
If you do one a week.

1934
00:52:51,770 --> 00:52:52,190
Yeah.

1935
00:52:52,190 --> 00:52:53,450
It's fucking hard.

1936
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:56,300
Making a sitcom is fucking hard.

1937
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:57,050
I've done it.

1938
00:52:57,050 --> 00:52:58,250
I did it for five years.

1939
00:52:58,550 --> 00:52:59,570
It is not easy.

1940
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,570
It becomes easier once things get jealous.

1941
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:03,771
But even then,

1942
00:53:03,771 --> 00:53:04,071
man,

1943
00:53:04,071 --> 00:53:05,990
writers fucking hit blocks.

1944
00:53:05,991 --> 00:53:07,130
They don't know what you mean.

1945
00:53:07,131 --> 00:53:09,120
There was days like we were in news radio,

1946
00:53:09,121 --> 00:53:10,280
like season four,

1947
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,980
there was days where the
scriptures didn't fucking work.

1948
00:53:13,010 --> 00:53:13,790
These grinding,

1949
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:17,420
these writers had busted their ass and
banged against the keyboards and they

1950
00:53:17,421 --> 00:53:21,600
just couldn't find a way to make this
scene work and they have what they've

1951
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:26,550
abandoned a whole scenes and putting
on new ones and rewrite things the next

1952
00:53:26,550 --> 00:53:26,930
day.

1953
00:53:26,930 --> 00:53:28,740
Were you involved in writing
at all at that point?

1954
00:53:29,070 --> 00:53:30,090
Not Writing,

1955
00:53:30,091 --> 00:53:35,091
but I wrote a lot of the jokes that I
sat on the show I did ad Lib done on what

1956
00:53:35,911 --> 00:53:39,140
we do is onset the way the
way work with Newsradio.

1957
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:40,080
Paul Simms,

1958
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:41,910
who is a creative genius,

1959
00:53:42,030 --> 00:53:42,751
so really,

1960
00:53:42,751 --> 00:53:43,740
really smart guy,

1961
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:46,200
but also he had a really healthy ego,

1962
00:53:46,410 --> 00:53:48,930
like it didn't have to be
his words that were read,

1963
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:51,120
so he would write things.

1964
00:53:51,121 --> 00:53:56,121
And then Dave Foley was really like an
uncredited producer of that show is dave

1965
00:53:56,611 --> 00:53:58,230
rewrote entire scenes.

1966
00:53:58,231 --> 00:53:59,400
He rewrote jokes,

1967
00:53:59,401 --> 00:54:03,780
wrote jokes for me and for Vicky Lewis
and for Andy different everybody.

1968
00:54:03,781 --> 00:54:04,890
He rewrote stuff.

1969
00:54:05,130 --> 00:54:09,120
And then would present this new
version of it and dave was like really

1970
00:54:09,121 --> 00:54:09,601
respectful.

1971
00:54:09,601 --> 00:54:10,680
It's like we have this idea,

1972
00:54:10,681 --> 00:54:11,514
we'd like to see it.

1973
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:12,451
And Paul was like,

1974
00:54:12,451 --> 00:54:12,660
yeah,

1975
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:13,493
let's see what you got.

1976
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:14,850
And then Paul would be like,

1977
00:54:14,851 --> 00:54:15,631
I like yours better,

1978
00:54:15,631 --> 00:54:16,380
let's go with that.

1979
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:16,951
That's great.

1980
00:54:16,951 --> 00:54:20,400
And so like literally
40 percent of that show,

1981
00:54:20,401 --> 00:54:25,401
maybe even more was adlibbed set by by
either fully or Andy ad libbed a lot of

1982
00:54:26,881 --> 00:54:27,151
stuff.

1983
00:54:27,151 --> 00:54:30,440
I ad libbed a lot of stuff
we wrote for each other now.

1984
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:31,291
Like sometimes you know,

1985
00:54:31,291 --> 00:54:33,720
you'd see Andy doing
something and I would go,

1986
00:54:33,721 --> 00:54:34,501
why don't you say this?

1987
00:54:34,501 --> 00:54:34,830
And be like,

1988
00:54:34,830 --> 00:54:36,030
Oh yes,

1989
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:36,631
or no,

1990
00:54:36,631 --> 00:54:38,220
or Vicky or whoever.

1991
00:54:38,221 --> 00:54:42,060
It's like that sort of environment
where you can all contribute.

1992
00:54:42,061 --> 00:54:42,300
To me,

1993
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:43,290
it just makes it better show,

1994
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:47,610
but it's not always that you get a cast
that can do that and think about that.

1995
00:54:47,611 --> 00:54:49,110
Just those names that you're using.

1996
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:50,430
Just this great.

1997
00:54:50,431 --> 00:54:51,480
Everyone's a killer.

1998
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:55,410
And that's how difficult it
is to just pull up a show.

1999
00:54:55,450 --> 00:54:56,520
Use having all those killer,

2000
00:54:56,521 --> 00:54:57,354
all that talent.

2001
00:54:57,420 --> 00:54:58,320
Phil Hartman,

2002
00:54:58,321 --> 00:54:59,220
Stephen Root,

2003
00:54:59,370 --> 00:55:02,360
and one of the few that didn't run,

2004
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:03,600
he didn't ad Lib anything.

2005
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:06,300
Stephen Root would get
the script and he would.

2006
00:55:06,630 --> 00:55:08,640
He was a character like
if you talked to him,

2007
00:55:08,641 --> 00:55:09,820
will you see him on Newsradio?

2008
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:11,070
You assume that he's that guy.

2009
00:55:11,370 --> 00:55:12,450
He's nothing like that guy.

2010
00:55:13,050 --> 00:55:14,220
He's the sweetest guy ever.

2011
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:14,421
He's like,

2012
00:55:14,421 --> 00:55:16,120
he's so nice and normal
when you meet them,

2013
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:17,161
but you know,

2014
00:55:17,161 --> 00:55:18,090
he'd had this.

2015
00:55:18,150 --> 00:55:21,390
Jimmy James Character was a
character that he developed.

2016
00:55:21,450 --> 00:55:23,640
He was the him and Phil Hartman
with the ones who were like.

2017
00:55:23,641 --> 00:55:24,770
They were like characters.

2018
00:55:24,970 --> 00:55:25,570
Yeah,

2019
00:55:25,570 --> 00:55:25,950
yeah.

2020
00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:27,420
They had developed the character.

2021
00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:28,980
Now imagine doing two of those a week.

2022
00:55:29,010 --> 00:55:29,281
Yeah,

2023
00:55:29,281 --> 00:55:30,114
it's impossible.

2024
00:55:30,150 --> 00:55:31,590
I don't know how the
fuck anybody would do it.

2025
00:55:31,650 --> 00:55:32,190
Right.

2026
00:55:32,190 --> 00:55:32,821
Not only that,

2027
00:55:32,821 --> 00:55:37,821
but doing two of them a week without Dave
Foley and without Paul Simms and maybe

2028
00:55:38,761 --> 00:55:40,140
the people that are writing
that show were good.

2029
00:55:40,141 --> 00:55:40,451
I don't know.

2030
00:55:40,451 --> 00:55:41,280
I don't know,

2031
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:43,620
but also there's no fucking incentive.

2032
00:55:43,621 --> 00:55:45,480
When you got 90 episodes picked up.

2033
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:45,830
It's like,

2034
00:55:45,830 --> 00:55:48,490
let's just smell this in go,

2035
00:55:48,590 --> 00:55:49,020
yeah,

2036
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:49,853
we're stuck here.

2037
00:55:51,290 --> 00:55:51,900
It's,

2038
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:53,160
you've got the GIG already.

2039
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:55,480
Gigs not going to go away right now.

2040
00:55:55,630 --> 00:55:57,240
It's hard to pull those
things off the air.

2041
00:55:58,250 --> 00:55:58,850
Oh man,

2042
00:55:58,850 --> 00:55:59,683
that is rough.

2043
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:02,613
Illuminati,

2044
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:03,311
Illuminati.

2045
00:56:03,311 --> 00:56:04,270
Is that organized?

2046
00:56:05,510 --> 00:56:06,100
I don't think.

2047
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:07,990
I don't even know what the Illuminati is.

2048
00:56:07,991 --> 00:56:11,290
I just consider it like Hollywood is
with this uber driver was talking about.

2049
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:16,150
People always want to think that
when it doesn't work out for them.

2050
00:56:16,151 --> 00:56:17,620
That's the thing about Hollywood.

2051
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:21,730
They all want to think that there's
some sort of grand conspiracy,

2052
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:22,660
a hundred percent,

2053
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:23,963
but you know,

2054
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:25,300
I think that with A.

2055
00:56:25,690 --> 00:56:27,610
Whenever you talk to like you know,

2056
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:28,840
I'm around comedians all the time,

2057
00:56:28,841 --> 00:56:31,750
so depending on who you're talking to,

2058
00:56:32,110 --> 00:56:32,943
they'll say,

2059
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:33,700
well they don't want.

2060
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:34,030
They're not,

2061
00:56:34,030 --> 00:56:35,290
they're not looking for white guys.

2062
00:56:36,430 --> 00:56:39,070
And then you talk to your other buddies
like they're not looking for black guys

2063
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:41,410
because he's black and
whether or not Asians,

2064
00:56:41,411 --> 00:56:42,191
there's only one Asian.

2065
00:56:42,191 --> 00:56:44,080
You can gather everybody wherever you are,

2066
00:56:44,081 --> 00:56:45,190
you think they don't want,

2067
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:48,760
but if you can create something and
that something is popular and that's

2068
00:56:48,761 --> 00:56:52,180
something is sellable and then people
are buying it and everybody loves it,

2069
00:56:52,190 --> 00:56:55,660
that's one of the beautiful things about
being a comic is that you can prove it

2070
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:56,613
on your own.

2071
00:56:56,650 --> 00:57:00,490
If you develop a following and you go
on stage and you start killing it on the

2072
00:57:00,491 --> 00:57:02,230
road and everybody wants to come see you,

2073
00:57:02,470 --> 00:57:03,850
they want to do a show with Tom,

2074
00:57:03,851 --> 00:57:04,510
papa,

2075
00:57:04,510 --> 00:57:04,811
Tom,

2076
00:57:04,811 --> 00:57:05,470
what are we going to do?

2077
00:57:05,470 --> 00:57:06,303
How do we get a po?

2078
00:57:06,430 --> 00:57:10,780
How do we get a piece of this money and
time trying to figure out how to profit

2079
00:57:10,781 --> 00:57:11,650
off of what you're doing?

2080
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:11,981
Right,

2081
00:57:11,981 --> 00:57:12,491
exactly.

2082
00:57:12,491 --> 00:57:14,950
You know this idea that there's
some sort of a grand conspiracy.

2083
00:57:14,951 --> 00:57:16,630
Know what you're selling sucks,

2084
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:16,961
right?

2085
00:57:16,961 --> 00:57:17,690
That's what you're selling.

2086
00:57:17,690 --> 00:57:18,850
You're selling is nothing.

2087
00:57:18,910 --> 00:57:19,360
Yeah.

2088
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:19,631
Right.

2089
00:57:19,631 --> 00:57:20,380
Exactly,

2090
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:21,490
and no one's interested.

2091
00:57:21,950 --> 00:57:23,290
That's conspiracy.

2092
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:24,213
Conspiracy.

2093
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:27,100
People are conspiring to only
put things that they like on TV.

2094
00:57:27,190 --> 00:57:28,023
Sorry.

2095
00:57:30,430 --> 00:57:30,701
Sorry.

2096
00:57:30,701 --> 00:57:31,740
You don't fit into that plane.

2097
00:57:31,741 --> 00:57:32,020
Oh,

2098
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:35,290
Bill Cosby is a part
of a grand conspiracy.

2099
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:36,993
That's hilarious.

2100
00:57:37,050 --> 00:57:41,200
They ties all these different women
and they got them to say the exact same

2101
00:57:41,201 --> 00:57:42,034
thing.

2102
00:57:42,370 --> 00:57:43,390
And Randy Quaid,

2103
00:57:43,391 --> 00:57:45,400
did you see that video
ratings crazy as fuck.

2104
00:57:45,830 --> 00:57:46,510
Yeah,

2105
00:57:46,510 --> 00:57:47,530
quaid crazy as fuck.

2106
00:57:47,531 --> 00:57:48,280
What happened?

2107
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:51,580
He released a new video today
where he knew him really well.

2108
00:57:51,581 --> 00:57:52,690
I don't know if it's the same one.

2109
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:58,120
I just saw the crazy white beard and he
puts a mask on his girlfriend simulates.

2110
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:03,370
So these fucking bad acting really nice.

2111
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:04,630
She's gone nuts.

2112
00:58:04,631 --> 00:58:05,464
He went crazy.

2113
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:07,120
He went crazy a couple of years ago,

2114
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:10,050
owed a lot of money and there was
like a house that he was living in.

2115
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:12,220
They kicked him out and he
was running from hotels,

2116
00:58:12,870 --> 00:58:13,770
seed ranch.

2117
00:58:14,770 --> 00:58:16,060
Real expensive place.

2118
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:17,490
Beautiful place,

2119
00:58:17,490 --> 00:58:17,740
right?

2120
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:21,940
You can crank up a real big bill and a
couple of days and he stayed for six days

2121
00:58:21,941 --> 00:58:22,774
and then split.

2122
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:24,113
Didn't pay it.

2123
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:25,870
He did that a couple of places.

2124
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:26,501
Oh man,

2125
00:58:26,501 --> 00:58:27,290
it got weird.

2126
00:58:27,290 --> 00:58:27,651
Oh,

2127
00:58:27,651 --> 00:58:27,860
it's.

2128
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:28,121
You know,

2129
00:58:28,121 --> 00:58:29,110
when people get old,

2130
00:58:29,111 --> 00:58:29,944
some people,

2131
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:34,900
they have a tendency for centricity and
then as they get old that morphs into

2132
00:58:34,901 --> 00:58:35,501
full blown.

2133
00:58:35,501 --> 00:58:36,100
Crazy.

2134
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:36,610
Right.

2135
00:58:36,610 --> 00:58:36,880
You know,

2136
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:39,550
it's like you got a little bit of a
cold and then next thing you got aids.

2137
00:58:40,530 --> 00:58:44,920
What's really weird is that his girlfriend
is out of your control is his wife is

2138
00:58:44,921 --> 00:58:46,030
on the on board though,

2139
00:58:46,031 --> 00:58:48,910
so it almost seems like maybe they're
just drug addicts together instead of

2140
00:58:48,911 --> 00:58:51,610
being a crazy thing because
the fact that she's not like,

2141
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:53,200
my husband's going crazy.

2142
00:58:53,201 --> 00:58:55,900
They might just be parts of both.

2143
00:58:55,901 --> 00:58:57,310
Get on the same page with that.

2144
00:58:57,420 --> 00:58:58,390
That's a good point.

2145
00:58:58,490 --> 00:58:58,870
Yeah.

2146
00:58:58,870 --> 00:58:59,860
It might be messed up.

2147
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:02,140
They're not using their
drugs like they don't put.

2148
00:59:02,141 --> 00:59:02,360
No,

2149
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:04,300
they're actors just don't do drugs,

2150
00:59:04,310 --> 00:59:05,143
man.

2151
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:12,430
Gene in this conspiracy the fuck.

2152
00:59:12,431 --> 00:59:13,264
I've

2153
00:59:14,890 --> 00:59:19,870
been interviewed by the ABC talking
about doing rocks and rocks.

2154
00:59:19,871 --> 00:59:20,471
You remember that?

2155
00:59:20,471 --> 00:59:20,930
Yeah.

2156
00:59:20,930 --> 00:59:21,860
That's how I roll.

2157
00:59:21,930 --> 00:59:22,240
Right,

2158
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:23,073
exactly.

2159
00:59:23,150 --> 00:59:23,980
Get off.

2160
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:24,091
Yeah.

2161
00:59:24,091 --> 00:59:27,410
I know a couple of rows that have signed
the papers where they're not allowed to

2162
00:59:27,411 --> 00:59:29,720
talk about the stuff that
happened with Charlie Sheen.

2163
00:59:30,410 --> 00:59:31,640
He makes them sign confident,

2164
00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:32,640
confident that she.

2165
00:59:32,810 --> 00:59:34,570
You give them money or
just hanging out with them.

2166
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:34,861
Shit.

2167
00:59:34,861 --> 00:59:35,810
Loads of money.

2168
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:40,660
Like really retarded amounts
of money for doing nothing.

2169
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:41,900
Girls just to come hang out.

2170
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:42,590
It is now,

2171
00:59:42,590 --> 00:59:47,590
let's just say that he's a big fan of
prostitutes and I think when you've got

2172
00:59:48,141 --> 00:59:49,580
the kind of money that that guy's got,

2173
00:59:49,790 --> 00:59:50,001
I mean,

2174
00:59:50,001 --> 00:59:55,001
he's been on several big time series a
bunch of movies probably worth close to a

2175
00:59:55,310 --> 00:59:55,851
billion dollars at this point.

2176
00:59:55,851 --> 00:59:56,570
Right?

2177
00:59:56,570 --> 00:59:57,560
So when you've got that,

2178
00:59:57,890 --> 01:00:01,560
putting aside 100 grand
for some little Greta,

2179
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:02,180
nothing.

2180
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:02,541
Listen,

2181
01:00:02,541 --> 01:00:03,201
senior retail,

2182
01:00:03,201 --> 01:00:04,550
we had some strange times.

2183
01:00:04,551 --> 01:00:08,540
A lot of people wouldn't understand
what went on between you and me and the

2184
01:00:08,540 --> 01:00:09,373
glass table.

2185
01:00:11,110 --> 01:00:12,380
You and I love it,

2186
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:14,030
but they wouldn't understand.

2187
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:17,660
He's got a transmission issue and you
need to get your tires changed and I'm

2188
01:00:17,661 --> 01:00:18,740
willing to do that for you.

2189
01:00:19,190 --> 01:00:21,710
I'll actually put a little bit
of sugar in your bank account.

2190
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:22,820
Just sign this.

2191
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,600
Put a little sugar in your bank account.

2192
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:26,083
Yeah.

2193
01:00:26,090 --> 01:00:30,710
I ran into this gal once at the
comedy store back in the day,

2194
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:31,191
uh,

2195
01:00:31,191 --> 01:00:35,330
with her new boyfriend that was one of
the playboy bunnies that lived on the,

2196
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:36,513
at the house.

2197
01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:38,750
And she was apparently going
to write some tell all,

2198
01:00:38,751 --> 01:00:40,250
but I don't know if she
ever wind up doing it.

2199
01:00:40,251 --> 01:00:41,480
But you know,

2200
01:00:41,510 --> 01:00:42,343
those,

2201
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:46,070
those stories where people have that
sort of a situation where you know,

2202
01:00:46,071 --> 01:00:49,700
you're getting paid by some guy and
there's some money being exchanged.

2203
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:53,770
Semi prostitutional type situation.

2204
01:00:55,330 --> 01:00:56,163
Just get weird.

2205
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:56,570
You know,

2206
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:58,790
you're dealing with some uber wealthy cat.

2207
01:00:58,850 --> 01:00:59,470
Oh Man.

2208
01:00:59,470 --> 01:01:00,303
You know,

2209
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:01,290
fucked up.

2210
01:01:01,290 --> 01:01:03,920
And like some crazy king.

2211
01:01:04,070 --> 01:01:04,520
Yeah.

2212
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:05,110
Well he was like,

2213
01:01:05,110 --> 01:01:05,851
well if you have to.

2214
01:01:05,851 --> 01:01:07,090
It's kind of like a crazy king.

2215
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:08,793
It's weird.

2216
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:12,710
Harem of young gals and
walking around in his robe.

2217
01:01:12,830 --> 01:01:13,720
I think another role.

2218
01:01:13,790 --> 01:01:14,623
Another guy,

2219
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:16,500
he's got a smoking jacket though.

2220
01:01:16,501 --> 01:01:17,500
It's got to get robes,

2221
01:01:18,530 --> 01:01:19,260
robes,

2222
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:19,970
eat robes.

2223
01:01:19,970 --> 01:01:20,130
That's.

2224
01:01:20,130 --> 01:01:21,560
We should do a whole show in robes.

2225
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:22,640
You down.

2226
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:23,430
I'm that lady.

2227
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:25,970
That lady is making us
those astronauts shirts.

2228
01:01:26,030 --> 01:01:26,863
I can't wait.

2229
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:27,893
What are those?

2230
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:28,933
Do you remember that?

2231
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:31,670
There was a scientist that got in trouble.

2232
01:01:31,820 --> 01:01:34,160
They landed on a comet.

2233
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:38,750
They landed a robot on a comment
and the guy who was celebrating it,

2234
01:01:39,110 --> 01:01:42,680
he wore a shirt that his friend designed.

2235
01:01:42,710 --> 01:01:47,300
It was his friend who's
into like rockabilly sort of
pin up girl type stuff and

2236
01:01:47,301 --> 01:01:47,510
she,

2237
01:01:47,510 --> 01:01:48,110
she that,

2238
01:01:48,110 --> 01:01:49,250
that picture right there,

2239
01:01:49,490 --> 01:01:49,820
that,

2240
01:01:49,820 --> 01:01:54,820
that was like an homage to his friend
because his friend made him that shirt and

2241
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:56,270
that's what she does.

2242
01:01:56,390 --> 01:01:56,901
So he said,

2243
01:01:56,901 --> 01:01:57,330
I'll just wear.

2244
01:01:57,330 --> 01:02:00,800
I'll wear your shirt on TV and
then all these people got so mad.

2245
01:02:00,801 --> 01:02:00,921
Like,

2246
01:02:00,921 --> 01:02:01,910
look at this against women.

2247
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:02,631
Roll up,

2248
01:02:02,631 --> 01:02:03,111
scroll up,

2249
01:02:03,111 --> 01:02:03,451
look at the,

2250
01:02:03,451 --> 01:02:03,631
the,

2251
01:02:03,631 --> 01:02:04,910
the actual title is,

2252
01:02:04,911 --> 01:02:07,150
I don't care if you landed
a space craft on a comment.

2253
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:09,410
Your shirt is sexist and ostracizing

2254
01:02:11,420 --> 01:02:16,190
you fucking Tommy is so bad ass.

2255
01:02:16,191 --> 01:02:16,790
Awesome.

2256
01:02:16,790 --> 01:02:17,623
Not only that,

2257
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:18,860
it's just sexy.

2258
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:21,870
I mean if he was wearing a
shirt with a bunch of men,

2259
01:02:21,871 --> 01:02:23,310
masters of the universe on it,

2260
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:26,220
the Tarzan with his long flowing locks,

2261
01:02:26,221 --> 01:02:28,200
swinging from anybody complained,

2262
01:02:28,550 --> 01:02:29,600
negative sell.

2263
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:30,510
It could be on the back,

2264
01:02:30,870 --> 01:02:31,081
right?

2265
01:02:31,081 --> 01:02:31,861
If that girl,

2266
01:02:31,861 --> 01:02:33,810
if the girl interviewing
him for whatever reason,

2267
01:02:33,811 --> 01:02:35,340
if the roles were reversed,

2268
01:02:35,550 --> 01:02:39,980
if he was the interviewer and she was
the scientist and she had a shirt on like

2269
01:02:39,981 --> 01:02:42,240
a bowling shirt with a
bunch of like studly,

2270
01:02:42,750 --> 01:02:43,900
bodybuilder do dot,

2271
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:44,820
it would be funny.

2272
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:45,181
Right,

2273
01:02:45,181 --> 01:02:45,820
exactly.

2274
01:02:45,820 --> 01:02:46,440
Yeah.

2275
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:47,640
Just have a good time.

2276
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:49,140
Enjoy your lives.

2277
01:02:49,350 --> 01:02:50,183
Well this,

2278
01:02:50,370 --> 01:02:51,990
these are just pin up girls.

2279
01:02:52,190 --> 01:02:54,570
They're just girls in like swanky,

2280
01:02:54,690 --> 01:02:55,680
sort of like,

2281
01:02:55,681 --> 01:02:56,970
he invented that stuff.

2282
01:02:56,971 --> 01:02:57,850
Fucking assholes.

2283
01:02:57,851 --> 01:02:59,100
No one likes to have fun anymore.

2284
01:03:02,380 --> 01:03:03,540
Let's have a good time.

2285
01:03:04,570 --> 01:03:05,460
Who are you?

2286
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:06,870
That's so upsetting to you?

2287
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:08,280
What's wrong with you?

2288
01:03:08,830 --> 01:03:10,320
It's just fucking shirt.

2289
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:11,371
He'll be one thing.

2290
01:03:11,371 --> 01:03:16,050
It was a bunch of chicks getting fucking
double penetrated was like a bunch of

2291
01:03:16,060 --> 01:03:17,440
chicks getting just,

2292
01:03:17,870 --> 01:03:19,170
you know what a airtight is.

2293
01:03:19,220 --> 01:03:19,890
Yeah.

2294
01:03:19,890 --> 01:03:20,723
Yeah.

2295
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:21,550
I uh,

2296
01:03:21,550 --> 01:03:22,890
had a friend and

2297
01:03:25,190 --> 01:03:29,280
his friend was dating a porn star
and he was cool with it for awhile.

2298
01:03:29,310 --> 01:03:29,700
It was like,

2299
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:29,911
oh,

2300
01:03:29,911 --> 01:03:30,511
it's okay.

2301
01:03:30,511 --> 01:03:31,020
You know what?

2302
01:03:31,020 --> 01:03:33,660
She brings home girls and all
this different jazz and uh,

2303
01:03:33,661 --> 01:03:34,171
you know,

2304
01:03:34,171 --> 01:03:34,291
uh,

2305
01:03:34,291 --> 01:03:34,811
what do you think about,

2306
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:34,951
oh,

2307
01:03:34,951 --> 01:03:35,700
it's just sex.

2308
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:40,700
And then one day he got ahold of her
contract and the contract said air tight.

2309
01:03:41,820 --> 01:03:43,860
It was like in the
contract and he was like,

2310
01:03:43,861 --> 01:03:44,670
what's airtight?

2311
01:03:44,670 --> 01:03:45,810
She's like a Dick and every hole.

2312
01:03:45,811 --> 01:03:46,140
He's like,

2313
01:03:46,140 --> 01:03:46,973
I'm out.

2314
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:51,550
Done sober on track.

2315
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:52,980
This is not my special lady.

2316
01:03:53,550 --> 01:03:54,560
This is not my specialty.

2317
01:03:54,570 --> 01:03:54,930
He just.

2318
01:03:54,930 --> 01:03:55,590
That was,

2319
01:03:55,590 --> 01:03:56,940
that was the breaking point.

2320
01:03:56,941 --> 01:03:58,320
I can't explain that one to my mom.

2321
01:03:58,321 --> 01:04:02,970
It's just sitting in
there going air air tight.

2322
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:05,633
And that was it.

2323
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:06,121
I'm sorry.

2324
01:04:06,121 --> 01:04:06,321
What?

2325
01:04:06,321 --> 01:04:06,700
What?

2326
01:04:06,700 --> 01:04:07,411
What does that mean?

2327
01:04:07,411 --> 01:04:08,400
Like he was cool.

2328
01:04:08,610 --> 01:04:09,450
He was cool with her,

2329
01:04:09,451 --> 01:04:10,530
with two guys.

2330
01:04:11,010 --> 01:04:12,060
He was cool with her,

2331
01:04:12,090 --> 01:04:13,410
but three was it.

2332
01:04:14,010 --> 01:04:17,830
Three was where he just about air tight.

2333
01:04:22,060 --> 01:04:26,230
It's like that's a sure sign this
too much porn being made right.

2334
01:04:26,370 --> 01:04:27,061
That a plug.

2335
01:04:27,061 --> 01:04:28,470
Every hole has it been done?

2336
01:04:28,471 --> 01:04:30,420
No plug and plug it up.

2337
01:04:30,421 --> 01:04:31,254
We're innovators.

2338
01:04:31,410 --> 01:04:32,071
Get that little guy.

2339
01:04:32,071 --> 01:04:33,070
We got two years to fill

2340
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:37,393
a lawyer.

2341
01:04:37,710 --> 01:04:42,420
Drafting that contract to squirt and
lube and your ear and just grabbing a top

2342
01:04:42,421 --> 01:04:46,110
and a bottom and just the
two midgets or making out.

2343
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:47,340
So they're gay.

2344
01:04:47,450 --> 01:04:48,720
If they're making out with each other,

2345
01:04:48,721 --> 01:04:51,960
whether they skull fucker ears and
another guy's fucking her mouth,

2346
01:04:52,030 --> 01:04:52,890
put that on a shirt.

2347
01:04:52,950 --> 01:04:54,090
It's probably been done.

2348
01:04:54,300 --> 01:04:55,320
We probably were wrong.

2349
01:04:55,350 --> 01:04:56,350
It's probably been done.

2350
01:04:57,490 --> 01:05:00,600
I don't think you can think up anything
that hasn't probably at this point,

2351
01:05:00,620 --> 01:05:01,020
right?

2352
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:01,890
It's probably Asian man.

2353
01:05:02,540 --> 01:05:02,900
What?

2354
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:03,230
What?

2355
01:05:03,230 --> 01:05:05,800
What year was the first
asked to mouth done?

2356
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:09,330
I mean that had to be
in the two thousands.

2357
01:05:09,331 --> 01:05:09,571
Right.

2358
01:05:09,571 --> 01:05:10,404
That didn't exist.

2359
01:05:10,530 --> 01:05:14,460
If you go back to the glory days
of like a Ginger Lynn and Ron,

2360
01:05:14,461 --> 01:05:16,260
Jeremy and Peter North,

2361
01:05:16,290 --> 01:05:17,710
there was no to mouth.

2362
01:05:17,711 --> 01:05:18,010
They didn't

2363
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:18,843
have to.

2364
01:05:18,870 --> 01:05:21,920
It was just people having sex fashion.

2365
01:05:21,990 --> 01:05:22,720
Good time.

2366
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:24,790
Like when Don rickles does that show,

2367
01:05:26,530 --> 01:05:31,530
he's got a silver robot and slip as that
show business we didn't have to do what

2368
01:05:31,991 --> 01:05:36,700
you do have to do as to mouth are tighter
in this fucking midget fucking your

2369
01:05:36,701 --> 01:05:39,270
ear and nonsense gimmicks.

2370
01:05:39,940 --> 01:05:42,430
It's what you rely on
when you got no talent.

2371
01:05:42,910 --> 01:05:44,290
It's like boogie nights.

2372
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:46,030
I don't do video.

2373
01:05:46,790 --> 01:05:47,850
I make film.

2374
01:05:49,010 --> 01:05:50,620
Do Video.

2375
01:05:51,190 --> 01:05:53,470
Do they even make films anymore with film?

2376
01:05:53,590 --> 01:05:54,760
They don't use film anymore,

2377
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:55,210
right?

2378
01:05:55,210 --> 01:05:56,030
Some do.

2379
01:05:56,030 --> 01:05:57,730
Do they hardly do for movies,

2380
01:05:57,790 --> 01:05:58,623
but you could bring.

2381
01:05:59,220 --> 01:06:02,080
There's some directors that only want
to shoot film because they don't believe

2382
01:06:02,081 --> 01:06:04,450
in the whole digital Tarantino.

2383
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:05,493
Right.

2384
01:06:07,250 --> 01:06:08,040
He's a wild man.

2385
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:09,220
Think documentaries.

2386
01:06:09,221 --> 01:06:14,221
A lot of documentaries maybe still be
on film photographers to believe in

2387
01:06:14,381 --> 01:06:15,370
photography like that.

2388
01:06:15,371 --> 01:06:16,960
It has to like digital photography,

2389
01:06:16,961 --> 01:06:18,490
like some something's missing,

2390
01:06:18,910 --> 01:06:19,743
right?

2391
01:06:20,050 --> 01:06:21,040
Nobody else sees.

2392
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:22,571
It's like when people are like,

2393
01:06:22,571 --> 01:06:23,170
no,

2394
01:06:23,170 --> 01:06:26,050
you've got to use this
gold cable for your system.

2395
01:06:26,051 --> 01:06:26,390
It's gonna,

2396
01:06:26,390 --> 01:06:26,651
you know,

2397
01:06:26,651 --> 01:06:31,651
you can use an instagram filter to
achieve all that you fuck for free.

2398
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:32,980
Yeah.

2399
01:06:32,980 --> 01:06:35,260
I don't think the new star wars movie,

2400
01:06:35,261 --> 01:06:40,261
they're not using like CGI this time
around or they're using like old school

2401
01:06:40,421 --> 01:06:43,060
like puppets and like
how they used to do it.

2402
01:06:43,330 --> 01:06:44,590
It's going to be pretty cool.

2403
01:06:44,990 --> 01:06:48,910
So there was definitely an overload
of CGI where you're just like,

2404
01:06:48,911 --> 01:06:51,850
am I if I'm watching a
video game at this point?

2405
01:06:51,851 --> 01:06:52,150
Yeah.

2406
01:06:52,150 --> 01:06:56,110
The Guy who directed my last comedy
special in wanting to do it in black and

2407
01:06:56,111 --> 01:06:56,470
white,

2408
01:06:56,470 --> 01:06:59,830
Steven Spielberg will bird
did his in black and white,

2409
01:06:59,831 --> 01:07:00,960
but I think he actually filmed it.

2410
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:01,360
I don't know,

2411
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:02,193
maybe he didn't,

2412
01:07:02,290 --> 01:07:02,680
but I.

2413
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:03,760
This was before that,

2414
01:07:03,761 --> 01:07:08,470
before birth or even before I even knew
bill doing isn't black and white and I

2415
01:07:08,471 --> 01:07:08,591
go,

2416
01:07:08,591 --> 01:07:09,610
but it's already in color.

2417
01:07:09,940 --> 01:07:10,990
Like why would they do that?

2418
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:11,833
Like what?

2419
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:15,550
Why not just draw it,

2420
01:07:15,610 --> 01:07:19,300
take all the frames and
drop everything I'm doing.

2421
01:07:20,020 --> 01:07:22,080
Just do your best colorize it.

2422
01:07:23,970 --> 01:07:27,610
Have an option to make it black and white
by turning it on and off on your TV.

2423
01:07:27,611 --> 01:07:31,310
You can make any special black
and white if you can do that.

2424
01:07:31,311 --> 01:07:31,800
Right?

2425
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:34,360
But if you fuck with the
contrast in the color color,

2426
01:07:34,990 --> 01:07:35,381
God,

2427
01:07:35,381 --> 01:07:36,430
it's just so weird.

2428
01:07:36,431 --> 01:07:41,431
This desire for the archaic to go back
to the old old timey camera and I'm going

2429
01:07:41,621 --> 01:07:42,810
to put the fucking needle on the

2430
01:07:44,710 --> 01:07:45,880
turntable that you got me.

2431
01:07:45,881 --> 01:07:47,440
Like it's still not working right?

2432
01:07:47,441 --> 01:07:48,550
Do we ever do anything about that?

2433
01:07:49,030 --> 01:07:49,600
Oh really?

2434
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:50,260
What's wrong with it?

2435
01:07:50,260 --> 01:07:50,651
Jamie?

2436
01:07:50,651 --> 01:07:51,191
Get on the ball.

2437
01:07:51,191 --> 01:07:52,024
So,

2438
01:07:52,290 --> 01:07:52,541
so yeah,

2439
01:07:52,541 --> 01:07:53,141
that's the problem.

2440
01:07:53,141 --> 01:07:53,591
Wasn't working.

2441
01:07:53,591 --> 01:07:55,690
I got my daughter a
turntable and it didn't work.

2442
01:07:55,691 --> 01:07:56,351
We have to bring it back.

2443
01:07:56,351 --> 01:07:57,760
Then the other thing that starts skipping,

2444
01:07:57,761 --> 01:07:58,300
it's like,

2445
01:07:58,300 --> 01:07:59,133
yeah,

2446
01:07:59,260 --> 01:08:02,440
this is why we stopped
seeing this kind of shitty.

2447
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:04,073
It's cool though.

2448
01:08:04,090 --> 01:08:06,910
It's undeniable that the
sound is a little different.

2449
01:08:06,950 --> 01:08:08,260
It's undeniable.

2450
01:08:09,710 --> 01:08:10,090
Well,

2451
01:08:10,090 --> 01:08:14,500
apparently there's a new walkman
that's expensive as fuck.

2452
01:08:14,530 --> 01:08:16,370
It's a new Sony Walkman

2453
01:08:16,580 --> 01:08:21,020
and it's an MP three recorder that is
supposed to have the most incredible

2454
01:08:21,021 --> 01:08:26,021
premium sound and Sony just released
this at the latest video show,

2455
01:08:27,231 --> 01:08:30,650
the consumer electronics
show in Vegas in Vegas,

2456
01:08:30,710 --> 01:08:34,250
and it's a big gamble because it's
like more than a thousand bucks.

2457
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:34,940
Are you serious?

2458
01:08:34,940 --> 01:08:35,330
Yeah.

2459
01:08:35,330 --> 01:08:35,511
Here,

2460
01:08:35,511 --> 01:08:40,280
I'll pull it up and we'll try this little
while Neil Young's book or read about

2461
01:08:40,310 --> 01:08:41,150
Neil Young's book.

2462
01:08:41,420 --> 01:08:42,253
He has this.

2463
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:44,300
Sony wants you to buy a 1000,

2464
01:08:44,301 --> 01:08:45,080
$200.

2465
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:46,100
MP three player.

2466
01:08:46,130 --> 01:08:46,963
Okay.

2467
01:08:47,030 --> 01:08:47,863
What's that sound?

2468
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:49,833
Hold on.

2469
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:52,980
Now you're hearing a sound stopped.

2470
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:54,610
Was on this cable.

2471
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:55,220
Oh,

2472
01:08:55,220 --> 01:08:55,781
the Kayla.

2473
01:08:55,781 --> 01:08:59,320
Does that chronic as we're
talking about better sound?

2474
01:09:00,310 --> 01:09:01,143
Uh,

2475
01:09:02,370 --> 01:09:02,830
yeah.

2476
01:09:02,830 --> 01:09:03,640
Ironic.

2477
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:04,151
Last one.

2478
01:09:04,151 --> 01:09:04,480
Sone.

2479
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:05,141
Finally unveil.

2480
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:06,090
New Walkman MP.

2481
01:09:06,091 --> 01:09:06,924
Three player.

2482
01:09:07,510 --> 01:09:09,090
Which many have been
expected for some time.

2483
01:09:09,100 --> 01:09:11,020
People first got to look at device at ces.

2484
01:09:11,021 --> 01:09:14,710
Two thousand 15 was asleep design or
excellent ergonomics that caught people's

2485
01:09:14,711 --> 01:09:15,011
eyes.

2486
01:09:15,011 --> 01:09:16,180
It was the price tag.

2487
01:09:16,630 --> 01:09:20,050
The zx priced at just under 1000,

2488
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:21,880
$200 for.

2489
01:09:21,940 --> 01:09:25,570
That's more than a phone which
already has an MP three player.

2490
01:09:25,630 --> 01:09:26,463
Yeah.

2491
01:09:26,740 --> 01:09:27,290
Hm.

2492
01:09:27,290 --> 01:09:28,120
Ha.

2493
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:28,953
Why?

2494
01:09:29,260 --> 01:09:32,500
Because it sounds so great
as the audio files choice,

2495
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:34,830
a new focus of the music and,

2496
01:09:34,950 --> 01:09:35,771
and we'll see.

2497
01:09:35,771 --> 01:09:37,270
I think that this kind of,

2498
01:09:38,020 --> 01:09:41,680
this kind of technology
will exist in phones soon.

2499
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:42,370
Right?

2500
01:09:42,370 --> 01:09:42,970
That's the thing.

2501
01:09:42,970 --> 01:09:45,550
But to buy it as a handheld outside,

2502
01:09:45,551 --> 01:09:48,400
I don't have a fucking
thing outside of my phone.

2503
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:49,473
Okay.

2504
01:09:49,690 --> 01:09:50,770
I have one for phone.

2505
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:54,970
My phone has a 128 fucking gigabytes.

2506
01:09:55,330 --> 01:09:58,390
There's plenty of God damn songs in
this thing and I'm not buying something

2507
01:09:58,391 --> 01:09:58,610
else.

2508
01:09:58,610 --> 01:09:59,300
No.

2509
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:04,300
And if I took a MP three file that was
say record at 1:28 kilobits per second or

2510
01:10:04,761 --> 01:10:05,091
whatever,

2511
01:10:05,091 --> 01:10:05,780
or you know,

2512
01:10:05,780 --> 01:10:07,820
twice that played both of them.

2513
01:10:08,060 --> 01:10:12,710
I really doubt most of us would even
care or hear the difference in it at all.

2514
01:10:12,740 --> 01:10:12,891
Well,

2515
01:10:12,891 --> 01:10:13,090
you know,

2516
01:10:13,090 --> 01:10:14,840
what does matter though is really good.

2517
01:10:14,841 --> 01:10:15,321
Headphones.

2518
01:10:15,321 --> 01:10:15,710
Yeah.

2519
01:10:15,710 --> 01:10:16,131
Really good.

2520
01:10:16,131 --> 01:10:16,964
Headphones matter,

2521
01:10:17,150 --> 01:10:18,980
my kids can play like their phones,

2522
01:10:19,270 --> 01:10:23,210
the coldplay song just in that speaker
and just leave it and it's Gacaca Gacaca

2523
01:10:23,211 --> 01:10:25,790
and they love it and it
really drives me crazy.

2524
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:27,230
I just came here.

2525
01:10:27,231 --> 01:10:29,030
That lame quality.

2526
01:10:29,090 --> 01:10:30,170
It just drives me nuts.

2527
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:32,150
I have these earbuds from.

2528
01:10:32,151 --> 01:10:32,984
Sure.

2529
01:10:33,050 --> 01:10:33,561
Oh yeah.

2530
01:10:33,561 --> 01:10:37,280
And they have like steel braided cables
that are covered with plastic or they're

2531
01:10:37,730 --> 01:10:39,710
very expensive and I was like,

2532
01:10:39,711 --> 01:10:39,981
all right,

2533
01:10:39,981 --> 01:10:40,700
let me just,

2534
01:10:40,700 --> 01:10:43,760
just for a goof by these things
and see if it makes a difference.

2535
01:10:43,790 --> 01:10:44,720
It makes a big fucking.

2536
01:10:44,721 --> 01:10:45,201
It does,

2537
01:10:45,201 --> 01:10:45,381
yeah.

2538
01:10:45,381 --> 01:10:47,740
They have like drivers inside the ears,

2539
01:10:48,020 --> 01:10:48,591
like the little,

2540
01:10:48,591 --> 01:10:50,730
but they feel weird phone.

2541
01:10:50,990 --> 01:10:51,270
Yeah,

2542
01:10:51,270 --> 01:10:52,101
plug it into my phone.

2543
01:10:52,101 --> 01:10:53,090
It's fucking fantastic.

2544
01:10:53,091 --> 01:10:54,680
And they're like blown
away like the regular.

2545
01:10:54,740 --> 01:10:55,341
Oh yeah,

2546
01:10:55,341 --> 01:10:55,551
yeah.

2547
01:10:55,551 --> 01:10:56,440
It's quite a bit quieter.

2548
01:10:56,550 --> 01:10:57,430
It's quite a bit better,

2549
01:10:57,590 --> 01:10:57,921
you know,

2550
01:10:57,921 --> 01:10:58,221
is it.

2551
01:10:58,221 --> 01:11:00,800
I don't remember how much it
costs a lot of money though,

2552
01:11:00,801 --> 01:11:01,340
but yeah.

2553
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:03,020
Is it like a thousand dollars better?

2554
01:11:03,021 --> 01:11:03,854
I don't know.

2555
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:04,140
Right.

2556
01:11:04,140 --> 01:11:05,360
It's interesting that driver thing,

2557
01:11:05,361 --> 01:11:09,080
because beats when they were still
together with Dr Dre and beats,

2558
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:09,320
you know,

2559
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:11,780
they used their own special driver.

2560
01:11:11,781 --> 01:11:14,140
A lot of people complain
that it was really basic

2561
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:14,640
and too,

2562
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:17,040
too much base now that they broke up.

2563
01:11:17,041 --> 01:11:18,960
I just got a new pair and
it's completely different.

2564
01:11:18,961 --> 01:11:22,590
It's like it doesn't even seem like
the same headphones even though it was

2565
01:11:22,950 --> 01:11:23,591
specific.

2566
01:11:23,591 --> 01:11:27,240
Almost exactly the same headphones I used
to have the same but it doesn't sound

2567
01:11:27,241 --> 01:11:29,130
the same reading and
they're bluetooth now.

2568
01:11:29,131 --> 01:11:30,900
So you just have these awesome headphones.

2569
01:11:30,901 --> 01:11:32,010
You can answer calls on them.

2570
01:11:32,011 --> 01:11:32,671
I mean it's great.

2571
01:11:32,671 --> 01:11:33,770
It's so.

2572
01:11:34,110 --> 01:11:36,300
And you guys are tech savvy.

2573
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:38,610
He's a Lebron,

2574
01:11:38,611 --> 01:11:38,880
you know,

2575
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:39,870
he's doing like the beats,

2576
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:40,740
wireless,

2577
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:42,060
things like that working out.

2578
01:11:42,630 --> 01:11:43,980
So if you're running though,

2579
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:46,200
that means you're like
I run with a shuffle,

2580
01:11:46,510 --> 01:11:47,000
you know,

2581
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:47,580
connected.

2582
01:11:47,580 --> 01:11:49,080
But that's not bluetooth.

2583
01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:50,370
Now you can't do it with a shuffle,

2584
01:11:50,371 --> 01:11:51,790
but you mean you can.

2585
01:11:51,791 --> 01:11:52,860
I'm running through the streets,

2586
01:11:52,890 --> 01:11:53,940
but the IPOD shuffle,

2587
01:11:54,650 --> 01:11:55,290
right?

2588
01:11:55,290 --> 01:11:57,450
Those little tiny ones with
the clip on those dope.

2589
01:11:57,540 --> 01:11:59,310
Just put them right on
your waistband and go,

2590
01:11:59,850 --> 01:12:00,000
well,

2591
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,040
you can't use the wireless now for that.

2592
01:12:02,090 --> 01:12:04,980
See what you need is a fucking
phone and a fanny pack.

2593
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:07,560
Everyone's scared of Goddamn fanny packs.

2594
01:12:07,590 --> 01:12:08,520
It's the way to go.

2595
01:12:08,521 --> 01:12:09,360
You slipped out,

2596
01:12:09,361 --> 01:12:10,440
sucker right in there,

2597
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:13,620
clip it down and go run
and do whatever they have.

2598
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:14,790
You're running with your phone?

2599
01:12:15,060 --> 01:12:15,271
Yeah,

2600
01:12:15,271 --> 01:12:15,960
I run with my phone.

2601
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:16,741
That makes me nervous.

2602
01:12:16,741 --> 01:12:17,640
I don't really run though.

2603
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:20,580
They had to use for
like running type stuff.

2604
01:12:20,581 --> 01:12:22,150
I do everything on a treadmill or on a.

2605
01:12:22,710 --> 01:12:23,610
not even a treadmill.

2606
01:12:23,611 --> 01:12:24,780
Usually elliptical machine.

2607
01:12:24,810 --> 01:12:26,440
You're not running through
the streets like a maniac.

2608
01:12:26,460 --> 01:12:29,280
I do plenty of pounding with
my joint hitting things.

2609
01:12:29,281 --> 01:12:32,390
I don't like to do extra
pounding for a budget.

2610
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:35,280
I think I've already taken chances
with my joints from kickboxing.

2611
01:12:35,790 --> 01:12:36,301
Fuck with it.

2612
01:12:36,301 --> 01:12:37,410
With all that other stuff.

2613
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:38,273
Yeah.

2614
01:12:38,670 --> 01:12:40,800
I just stopped getting nervous
up running with my phone.

2615
01:12:40,830 --> 01:12:41,641
They have those cases.

2616
01:12:41,641 --> 01:12:45,570
I have one that your phone goes in and
it just goes on your own and those are

2617
01:12:45,571 --> 01:12:47,400
good and you don't even feel
like you have it on there.

2618
01:12:47,550 --> 01:12:48,060
Oh really?

2619
01:12:48,060 --> 01:12:48,511
Do you have the.

2620
01:12:48,511 --> 01:12:49,500
You don't have the plus though.

2621
01:12:49,501 --> 01:12:50,334
You have the six.

2622
01:12:50,390 --> 01:12:51,840
I went back down to the six.

2623
01:12:51,870 --> 01:12:52,703
You have a blessed.

2624
01:12:53,180 --> 01:12:54,013
Do you like it?

2625
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:54,913
I love it.

2626
01:12:54,990 --> 01:12:57,470
I feel like I got the six and I feel
like I should have gotten a bigger.

2627
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:58,380
What's better?

2628
01:12:58,380 --> 01:13:00,360
The battery life is tremendous.

2629
01:13:00,390 --> 01:13:01,290
It's so great.

2630
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:04,110
The battery's good for
like couple of days.

2631
01:13:04,770 --> 01:13:05,850
It's really good.

2632
01:13:06,150 --> 01:13:06,421
You know,

2633
01:13:06,421 --> 01:13:07,710
like I can listen to music.

2634
01:13:07,711 --> 01:13:10,170
I believe I bring it to when I do shows,

2635
01:13:10,171 --> 01:13:12,450
I have a bluetooth hooked
up to this little speaker.

2636
01:13:12,451 --> 01:13:14,190
I set the speaker up in the green room.

2637
01:13:14,460 --> 01:13:16,300
I play music with it
and then I get onstage.

2638
01:13:16,410 --> 01:13:19,320
I record all my sets with it
and I go to shows with that,

2639
01:13:19,321 --> 01:13:20,041
play in the music,

2640
01:13:20,041 --> 01:13:21,220
all that and pictures.

2641
01:13:21,510 --> 01:13:22,343
No braylee,

2642
01:13:22,380 --> 01:13:23,213
no problems.

2643
01:13:23,250 --> 01:13:24,180
The battery does go on.

2644
01:13:24,181 --> 01:13:24,571
The sixth one.

2645
01:13:24,571 --> 01:13:25,610
You're listening to the last supper.

2646
01:13:25,620 --> 01:13:27,390
Watching stuff goes.

2647
01:13:27,391 --> 01:13:29,360
I mean the six is essentially
the same batteries.

2648
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:30,233
A five,

2649
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:31,900
the five s it's the same battery.

2650
01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:32,491
It is this.

2651
01:13:32,491 --> 01:13:33,020
Yeah.

2652
01:13:33,020 --> 01:13:35,730
This basically the same battery
life but a larger screen.

2653
01:13:35,731 --> 01:13:36,750
So it sort of counters.

2654
01:13:36,980 --> 01:13:38,340
It might be a slightly larger battery,

2655
01:13:38,341 --> 01:13:39,060
but a larger screen.

2656
01:13:39,060 --> 01:13:40,520
I always buy the wrong stuff to do.

2657
01:13:40,521 --> 01:13:41,354
You could

2658
01:13:42,290 --> 01:13:42,920
get a new one,

2659
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:43,753
give it away,

2660
01:13:44,210 --> 01:13:45,060
give it to somebody,

2661
01:13:45,061 --> 01:13:45,600
to somebody.

2662
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:46,560
Give it to your kid.

2663
01:13:47,010 --> 01:13:47,843
Yeah.

2664
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:48,780
You know,

2665
01:13:48,780 --> 01:13:49,613
I guess

2666
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:52,430
first world problem.

2667
01:13:52,460 --> 01:13:53,670
I always find things twice.

2668
01:13:53,810 --> 01:13:55,560
I'm never like think things through.

2669
01:13:55,650 --> 01:13:56,970
I had to make the right purpose.

2670
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:02,000
I have a podcast phone for the studio
that's a Samsung Galaxy s five and there's

2671
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:05,640
parts of that that I liked
better than the iphone.

2672
01:14:05,950 --> 01:14:06,900
A little bit smaller.

2673
01:14:06,901 --> 01:14:09,110
It's five inches instead of a.

2674
01:14:09,410 --> 01:14:10,820
is this just because you're
friends with Newell Brands?

2675
01:14:10,821 --> 01:14:12,200
Like five point five now?

2676
01:14:12,820 --> 01:14:15,340
I don't want to say anything that
gets Neal Brennan in trouble,

2677
01:14:15,341 --> 01:14:17,560
but he might not always
use the phone all the time.

2678
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:19,470
I don't know what you're talking about.

2679
01:14:21,930 --> 01:14:22,990
What I like about this,

2680
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:23,913
the um,

2681
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:27,160
the Samsung is this
little bad boy right here.

2682
01:14:27,250 --> 01:14:30,430
This thing would it clips in place
before you can drop it in the toilet.

2683
01:14:31,090 --> 01:14:32,350
It's fucking waterproof.

2684
01:14:32,790 --> 01:14:34,330
It water resistant,

2685
01:14:34,331 --> 01:14:37,360
but the fucking thing and
go under water and be fine.

2686
01:14:37,810 --> 01:14:39,310
Whereas if this bitch goes underwater,

2687
01:14:39,340 --> 01:14:40,173
it's a dead man.

2688
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:43,840
There's nothing scarier than like having
a glass of water next to your phone on

2689
01:14:43,841 --> 01:14:47,470
the counter and it's got a
heartbeat detector right there.

2690
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:50,290
You put your finger over there and it
shows you your heartbeat to see if you're

2691
01:14:50,291 --> 01:14:50,860
in love.

2692
01:14:50,860 --> 01:14:51,690
Yes,

2693
01:14:51,690 --> 01:14:52,301
it's very important.

2694
01:14:52,301 --> 01:14:53,134
It's a mood ring,

2695
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:57,080
which you can do with
apps and now the Apps,

2696
01:14:57,090 --> 01:14:58,900
the way you put your finger over the,

2697
01:14:58,901 --> 01:15:00,070
it actually measures.

2698
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:03,010
They have an app on the
iphone where it measures the,

2699
01:15:03,011 --> 01:15:08,011
uses the flash from the camera and
it pulses on your finger and actually

2700
01:15:08,441 --> 01:15:09,610
measures the,

2701
01:15:09,670 --> 01:15:09,811
uh,

2702
01:15:09,811 --> 01:15:14,170
the heartbeats from reading with
the Camera Lens and reading your,

2703
01:15:14,171 --> 01:15:14,570
your,

2704
01:15:14,570 --> 01:15:14,820
the,

2705
01:15:14,820 --> 01:15:16,210
the light on your finger.

2706
01:15:16,630 --> 01:15:17,440
That's amazing.

2707
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:17,900
Easy,

2708
01:15:17,900 --> 01:15:18,270
right?

2709
01:15:18,270 --> 01:15:18,941
He's a great world.

2710
01:15:18,941 --> 01:15:19,720
We live in.

2711
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:20,800
What I like about this though,

2712
01:15:20,801 --> 01:15:23,080
there's two things that I
like about the Samsung first,

2713
01:15:23,110 --> 01:15:27,220
the big one is you could take the
fucking battery out and put a new one in.

2714
01:15:27,221 --> 01:15:29,950
So if your battery runs
dry extra in your bank,

2715
01:15:30,010 --> 01:15:34,750
you put a separate battery pack and
you have a full charge instantly.

2716
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:36,240
Then also I like,

2717
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:37,630
you can add memory,

2718
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:41,050
you could stick a little memory card
in there and you get an extra 128 gigs.

2719
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:41,351
Yeah.

2720
01:15:41,351 --> 01:15:42,184
But you don't,

2721
01:15:42,220 --> 01:15:43,570
you don't seem as cool.

2722
01:15:45,030 --> 01:15:46,680
Were you trying to impress Tom Pop?

2723
01:15:46,700 --> 01:15:48,580
I don't know everybody I think.

2724
01:15:48,581 --> 01:15:49,414
Well we,

2725
01:15:49,470 --> 01:15:51,640
there's no perfect phone
is what I'm saying.

2726
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:54,880
There's parts of this that I love
seeing the two phone numbers.

2727
01:15:55,030 --> 01:15:55,863
Yes.

2728
01:15:56,170 --> 01:15:56,991
This is the uh,

2729
01:15:56,991 --> 01:15:57,850
the studio phone.

2730
01:15:58,060 --> 01:15:58,600
Gotcha.

2731
01:15:58,600 --> 01:15:58,990
Yeah.

2732
01:15:58,990 --> 01:15:59,823
Gotcha.

2733
01:16:00,420 --> 01:16:01,253
This is,

2734
01:16:01,810 --> 01:16:02,643
this is better.

2735
01:16:03,270 --> 01:16:03,760
This is,

2736
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:04,180
yeah.

2737
01:16:04,180 --> 01:16:06,250
This is a better operating system.

2738
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:09,250
The iphone operating
system is clearly better.

2739
01:16:09,430 --> 01:16:09,870
Right.

2740
01:16:09,870 --> 01:16:12,010
And the iphone camera
is a little better too,

2741
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:13,720
but that's pretty God damn good.

2742
01:16:13,750 --> 01:16:18,340
I mean the difference between the galaxy
operating system and the iphone and the

2743
01:16:18,341 --> 01:16:19,840
camera and the camera.

2744
01:16:19,841 --> 01:16:20,300
And this is.

2745
01:16:20,300 --> 01:16:23,080
So you're kind of splitting hairs.

2746
01:16:23,140 --> 01:16:23,973
Yeah.

2747
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:25,421
It feels the same.

2748
01:16:25,421 --> 01:16:26,254
Brian Disagree.

2749
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:27,830
Have you fucked with the SRO?

2750
01:16:27,910 --> 01:16:29,710
Apple if you fucked
with the galaxy s five.

2751
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:30,070
I know,

2752
01:16:30,070 --> 01:16:31,640
but I've heard a lot of
complaints about the Svi,

2753
01:16:31,660 --> 01:16:33,850
especially with the a thumbprint sensors

2754
01:16:35,390 --> 01:16:37,120
sensor is dog shit.

2755
01:16:37,121 --> 01:16:37,870
I do love.

2756
01:16:37,870 --> 01:16:38,561
I do love that.

2757
01:16:38,561 --> 01:16:40,030
About it's great on the iphone.

2758
01:16:40,060 --> 01:16:41,530
It's dog shit.

2759
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:42,250
Oh really?

2760
01:16:42,250 --> 01:16:42,790
Yeah,

2761
01:16:42,790 --> 01:16:43,481
like I'll show you.

2762
01:16:43,481 --> 01:16:43,781
Watch.

2763
01:16:43,781 --> 01:16:44,950
I have to do it like four times.

2764
01:16:45,660 --> 01:16:46,120
Shit.

2765
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:46,421
Watch.

2766
01:16:46,421 --> 01:16:46,990
Here we go.

2767
01:16:46,990 --> 01:16:47,291
Let's look.

2768
01:16:47,291 --> 01:16:49,690
It says swipe the entire pad.

2769
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:49,901
Why?

2770
01:16:49,901 --> 01:16:50,830
You have to tell me that.

2771
01:16:50,831 --> 01:16:51,071
Okay,

2772
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:51,904
I'll swipe it.

2773
01:16:52,180 --> 01:16:52,931
Oh No,

2774
01:16:52,931 --> 01:16:53,411
match.

2775
01:16:53,411 --> 01:16:54,570
You fucking cunt.

2776
01:16:55,630 --> 01:16:56,710
No match again.

2777
01:16:56,711 --> 01:16:57,610
You fuckhead.

2778
01:16:57,820 --> 01:16:58,530
Let's see Warren.

2779
01:16:58,530 --> 01:16:59,290
Time.

2780
01:16:59,290 --> 01:17:00,100
Three times.

2781
01:17:00,100 --> 01:17:00,821
It's my thumb.

2782
01:17:00,821 --> 01:17:01,750
I only have one of them.

2783
01:17:02,510 --> 01:17:03,370
You fuck.

2784
01:17:03,810 --> 01:17:04,750
I've been five.

2785
01:17:04,751 --> 01:17:06,850
Unsuccessful attempts
to unlock your device.

2786
01:17:06,851 --> 01:17:07,870
Try again in 30 seconds.

2787
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:08,833
That's it.

2788
01:17:09,470 --> 01:17:10,190
I'm out.

2789
01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:11,060
You couldn't go through that.

2790
01:17:11,061 --> 01:17:11,780
I really couldn't.

2791
01:17:11,780 --> 01:17:14,660
Fucking son of a bitch.

2792
01:17:15,180 --> 01:17:18,210
You're getting chased down an alley
trying to call nine slash 11 while you're

2793
01:17:18,211 --> 01:17:20,220
doing this crap or you know.

2794
01:17:21,380 --> 01:17:23,130
The best thing is just go on a road trip.

2795
01:17:23,160 --> 01:17:24,060
Have both phones.

2796
01:17:24,061 --> 01:17:27,180
Try to use that on the way to somewhere
and try to use the iphone on the way

2797
01:17:27,181 --> 01:17:27,481
back.

2798
01:17:27,481 --> 01:17:28,470
You'll know what I'm talking about.

2799
01:17:28,650 --> 01:17:29,483
This crap.

2800
01:17:31,740 --> 01:17:32,970
Case closed counselor.

2801
01:17:33,390 --> 01:17:34,230
One second.

2802
01:17:34,260 --> 01:17:34,770
Let's see,

2803
01:17:34,770 --> 01:17:35,461
one second.

2804
01:17:35,461 --> 01:17:37,680
Let's see if I can do it faster.

2805
01:17:37,681 --> 01:17:40,560
Is sent me anything recognized.

2806
01:17:40,590 --> 01:17:40,711
Oh,

2807
01:17:40,711 --> 01:17:41,640
you recognize me?

2808
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:44,700
You love me.

2809
01:17:44,830 --> 01:17:45,810
That's so cute.

2810
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:46,711
We like it.

2811
01:17:46,711 --> 01:17:47,080
Joe.

2812
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:47,940
It's disgusting.

2813
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:48,151
Now,

2814
01:17:48,151 --> 01:17:48,984
did you.

2815
01:17:50,070 --> 01:17:50,550
What's up?

2816
01:17:50,550 --> 01:17:51,311
Did you do both?

2817
01:17:51,311 --> 01:17:51,671
Thumbs.

2818
01:17:51,671 --> 01:17:53,020
Are you using like the wrong thumb?

2819
01:17:53,050 --> 01:17:54,900
Like you only did one
film and not the others.

2820
01:17:55,690 --> 01:17:56,650
Oh Man.

2821
01:17:56,780 --> 01:17:57,500
No,

2822
01:17:57,500 --> 01:17:57,950
no.

2823
01:17:57,950 --> 01:17:58,211
I mean,

2824
01:17:58,211 --> 01:17:58,561
I mean I,

2825
01:17:58,561 --> 01:17:59,370
yeah,

2826
01:17:59,370 --> 01:18:00,660
I use one thumb.

2827
01:18:00,661 --> 01:18:02,940
I only use one thumb on
this fucking piece of shit.

2828
01:18:03,180 --> 01:18:04,590
I opened my laptop at home

2829
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:05,713
and it,

2830
01:18:06,230 --> 01:18:11,230
there's my wifi and then there's the
printer Wifi and it just goes to the

2831
01:18:11,751 --> 01:18:12,830
printer Wifi.

2832
01:18:13,340 --> 01:18:16,780
I opened it up and I go to and
it's just that having to go

2833
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:19,650
change it from the printer
to the thing every time.

2834
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:21,110
Just forget that me,

2835
01:18:21,390 --> 01:18:22,223
I might move.

2836
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:23,160
You should kill someone.

2837
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:28,020
I literally physically
with the table like Oh,

2838
01:18:30,260 --> 01:18:31,093
anger.

2839
01:18:31,630 --> 01:18:35,460
But I mean the idea of even having a
fingerprint sensor on your phone was so

2840
01:18:35,461 --> 01:18:36,060
sexy.

2841
01:18:36,060 --> 01:18:37,200
Just a little while ago.

2842
01:18:37,540 --> 01:18:38,430
They came out with that.

2843
01:18:38,431 --> 01:18:38,880
With the.

2844
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:39,990
Was this the first one?

2845
01:18:39,991 --> 01:18:42,300
I had the fingerprint sensor
with the iphone or the last five?

2846
01:18:42,690 --> 01:18:43,523
Five.

2847
01:18:43,870 --> 01:18:44,160
Five.

2848
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:44,750
Five.

2849
01:18:44,750 --> 01:18:46,010
Like the upgraded five?

2850
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:47,030
Yeah.

2851
01:18:47,030 --> 01:18:48,420
I'd love the fingerprint sensor.

2852
01:18:48,690 --> 01:18:51,900
It is general that cops can force
you to use the fingerprint sensor,

2853
01:18:52,050 --> 01:18:54,450
but they can't force you to enter in your,

2854
01:18:54,451 --> 01:18:55,140
um,

2855
01:18:55,140 --> 01:18:55,973
your code.

2856
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:56,820
Wow.

2857
01:18:56,820 --> 01:18:57,810
So have you ever get addressed,

2858
01:18:58,080 --> 01:18:58,830
arrested,

2859
01:18:58,830 --> 01:19:00,330
delete all of your fingerprints?

2860
01:19:00,430 --> 01:19:01,270
I have a great tip.

2861
01:19:01,271 --> 01:19:03,460
I just found out that it's really scary.

2862
01:19:03,490 --> 01:19:05,050
Is that turn off?

2863
01:19:05,380 --> 01:19:06,580
Turn off this thing,

2864
01:19:06,581 --> 01:19:06,761
you know,

2865
01:19:06,761 --> 01:19:09,970
like if you have your phone
up and you go up like that,

2866
01:19:09,971 --> 01:19:12,140
you can have like that quick menu shit.

2867
01:19:12,150 --> 01:19:13,210
Like you lose your phone,

2868
01:19:13,300 --> 01:19:14,140
somebody picks it up,

2869
01:19:14,141 --> 01:19:16,930
they put it in airplane mode so you
can't find your phone and they steal your

2870
01:19:16,931 --> 01:19:17,261
phone.

2871
01:19:17,261 --> 01:19:21,580
So there was no way for the
find your phone app to find you.

2872
01:19:22,060 --> 01:19:25,180
So you need to turn off
this swipe up Mineo uh,

2873
01:19:25,780 --> 01:19:27,160
because that's what they do.

2874
01:19:27,190 --> 01:19:28,750
Like if you leave a phone in a taxi,

2875
01:19:28,860 --> 01:19:30,610
the taxi guy goes up.

2876
01:19:30,990 --> 01:19:31,823
No,

2877
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:33,330
now he knows.

2878
01:19:33,880 --> 01:19:36,640
Now that you're sharing this
information with the terrorists.

2879
01:19:36,641 --> 01:19:37,660
Jesus Christ.

2880
01:19:37,661 --> 01:19:38,340
Brian.

2881
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:39,010
Brian,

2882
01:19:39,010 --> 01:19:40,000
that does make sense though.

2883
01:19:40,001 --> 01:19:40,834
They can't use the phone,

2884
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:43,330
your phone because people have
gotten their asses kicked from that.

2885
01:19:43,331 --> 01:19:44,164
Find your phone,

2886
01:19:44,410 --> 01:19:44,960
will you,

2887
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:46,290
you know someone stole your phone.

2888
01:19:46,300 --> 01:19:47,021
You Ding Dong.

2889
01:19:47,021 --> 01:19:47,411
Excuse me.

2890
01:19:47,411 --> 01:19:48,244
You have my phone.

2891
01:19:48,670 --> 01:19:49,503
I don't know what you're talking about.

2892
01:19:50,770 --> 01:19:52,030
I got to find your phone APP.

2893
01:19:52,031 --> 01:19:54,490
You fuckhead they could
only find the address.

2894
01:19:54,491 --> 01:19:56,020
They can't find like what room it's in.

2895
01:19:56,650 --> 01:19:58,180
You have to tear someone's Goddamn House.

2896
01:19:58,220 --> 01:19:59,320
Go through the whole hotel.

2897
01:19:59,580 --> 01:20:00,760
How accurate is it?

2898
01:20:00,940 --> 01:20:01,860
It's not like one of those.

2899
01:20:02,020 --> 01:20:02,220
No,

2900
01:20:02,220 --> 01:20:03,770
it's pretty on homing devices.

2901
01:20:03,810 --> 01:20:05,340
How motivated you phone?

2902
01:20:05,580 --> 01:20:06,880
Like what if it's an
apartment building in.

2903
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:08,340
It's pretty accurate

2904
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:08,531
Joe,

2905
01:20:08,531 --> 01:20:09,390
because I own my house.

2906
01:20:09,391 --> 01:20:11,040
I can see exactly what room I'm in.

2907
01:20:11,070 --> 01:20:12,270
If I look at myself,

2908
01:20:12,340 --> 01:20:12,810
it does it.

2909
01:20:12,810 --> 01:20:13,740
What does it show you?

2910
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:18,210
It shows me the outline of my house in
Google maps and then it shows me what

2911
01:20:18,211 --> 01:20:20,970
room I'm in this room.

2912
01:20:20,971 --> 01:20:21,481
Your phone,

2913
01:20:21,481 --> 01:20:21,820
isn't it?

2914
01:20:21,820 --> 01:20:22,653
Yeah,

2915
01:20:22,900 --> 01:20:23,790
I'll use that.

2916
01:20:23,990 --> 01:20:25,200
Like if I can't find my phone,

2917
01:20:25,350 --> 01:20:28,830
I'll go on my laptop and make it play
a sound and I'll find my phone like,

2918
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:29,170
you know,

2919
01:20:29,170 --> 01:20:30,630
underneath the couch
or something like that.

2920
01:20:30,750 --> 01:20:31,680
That's incredible.

2921
01:20:31,681 --> 01:20:34,230
So I could play a sound even if it's off.

2922
01:20:34,231 --> 01:20:34,620
Right.

2923
01:20:34,620 --> 01:20:36,660
Even if the sound the ringer's off.

2924
01:20:36,750 --> 01:20:37,160
Yeah.

2925
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:37,993
Yeah.

2926
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:40,950
There's also another app
I recommend called secret,

2927
01:20:40,951 --> 01:20:44,340
which is another one that I put on all
my phones and my laptops and stuff and

2928
01:20:44,341 --> 01:20:44,701
what it is.

2929
01:20:44,701 --> 01:20:47,670
It's a program that's always running
that does the same kind of thing,

2930
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:50,320
but you could also turn on
your Webcam and take photos.

2931
01:20:50,321 --> 01:20:51,810
So if somebody stole your laptop,

2932
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:54,210
they won't even know that you're
just sitting at filming them,

2933
01:20:54,211 --> 01:20:55,200
getting their gps,

2934
01:20:55,410 --> 01:20:59,750
get every single key type that they type
in or your girlfriend can put that shit

2935
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:00,511
on your phone and catch,

2936
01:21:00,511 --> 01:21:01,344
you know,

2937
01:21:02,810 --> 01:21:04,440
it always comes back to bite Ya.

2938
01:21:05,250 --> 01:21:05,940
My.

2939
01:21:05,940 --> 01:21:07,560
I did the find your phone.

2940
01:21:07,750 --> 01:21:12,270
It's like my friends or something to see
where my daughter was and it's not that

2941
01:21:12,271 --> 01:21:13,050
accurate.

2942
01:21:13,050 --> 01:21:16,140
It's always like it said she was in a
black neighborhood and that's just not.

2943
01:21:16,170 --> 01:21:16,741
It can't be.

2944
01:21:16,741 --> 01:21:17,574
Right.

2945
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:21,230
That's just bad technology.

2946
01:21:22,790 --> 01:21:24,780
I made no sense.

2947
01:21:25,860 --> 01:21:26,190
Tell me,

2948
01:21:26,190 --> 01:21:27,023
you were at school,

2949
01:21:27,430 --> 01:21:28,263
you were at school.

2950
01:21:28,980 --> 01:21:31,410
It's way more accurate if you're
connected to a wifi network.

2951
01:21:31,660 --> 01:21:35,100
Like if she's not connected to a wifi
network and it has to try to guess where

2952
01:21:35,101 --> 01:21:35,934
it's where it is,

2953
01:21:36,540 --> 01:21:38,280
but it doesn't work on airplane mode.

2954
01:21:38,281 --> 01:21:39,114
Huh?

2955
01:21:39,690 --> 01:21:40,520
That's weak.

2956
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:40,730
Yeah.

2957
01:21:40,730 --> 01:21:42,510
They need to change that
or they need to make it.

2958
01:21:42,511 --> 01:21:43,350
So your thumbprint.

2959
01:21:43,590 --> 01:21:45,780
If it's locked that menu.

2960
01:21:45,810 --> 01:21:47,280
I love that swiping up thing.

2961
01:21:47,290 --> 01:21:48,540
They'll use the flashlight.

2962
01:21:48,570 --> 01:21:50,010
I use the flashlight all the time.

2963
01:21:50,011 --> 01:21:52,050
There's no way I'm turning
off that up swipe thing.

2964
01:21:52,070 --> 01:21:52,241
Yeah.

2965
01:21:52,241 --> 01:21:53,250
That's why it bumped things.

2966
01:21:53,251 --> 01:21:53,791
Pretty Dope.

2967
01:21:53,791 --> 01:21:55,500
I just wonder if you could turn it off.

2968
01:21:55,650 --> 01:21:57,300
You know from the lock screen,

2969
01:21:57,330 --> 01:21:58,650
like if it's on a lock screen,

2970
01:21:58,730 --> 01:22:00,660
I like to use a camera from that or just

2971
01:22:02,610 --> 01:22:03,443
alarm.

2972
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:04,680
Oh,

2973
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:07,730
there's things I can't do two steps.

2974
01:22:07,730 --> 01:22:09,420
God dammit can't handle that.

2975
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:10,650
It's very busy.

2976
01:22:10,651 --> 01:22:11,770
You have a little day.

2977
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:12,740
Take a little bit about.

2978
01:22:13,130 --> 01:22:15,330
It's just things are constantly improving.

2979
01:22:15,331 --> 01:22:17,790
They're constantly innovating
and adding to them.

2980
01:22:17,791 --> 01:22:20,480
And that sound thing that
you see on that walk,

2981
01:22:20,481 --> 01:22:20,760
man.

2982
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:24,120
You'd be a silly person to buy
that stupid $1,200 dollar walkman.

2983
01:22:24,150 --> 01:22:24,900
Oh yeah.

2984
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:26,730
Because that's going to
be in your phone soon.

2985
01:22:26,870 --> 01:22:27,703
That sort of.

2986
01:22:27,750 --> 01:22:28,950
I know they're working on that.

2987
01:22:28,951 --> 01:22:32,640
They're working on improvements or I've
read something about the digital cell

2988
01:22:32,641 --> 01:22:36,420
phones working on improvements of sound
quality in anticipation of these types

2989
01:22:36,421 --> 01:22:37,254
of devices.

2990
01:22:37,980 --> 01:22:39,200
You know what I want them to do?

2991
01:22:39,230 --> 01:22:40,230
Do you use apple pay?

2992
01:22:40,231 --> 01:22:41,300
Do you use that brain wave?

2993
01:22:41,330 --> 01:22:42,163
The phone.

2994
01:22:42,450 --> 01:22:43,420
He's waving the phone and it pays.

2995
01:22:43,980 --> 01:22:48,270
I want them to fix the
a toll system at lax.

2996
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:51,090
You ever get in the car after a
Gig or whatever and then you like,

2997
01:22:51,430 --> 01:22:55,440
there's that line and nobody has the
thing and find the card and it just takes

2998
01:22:55,441 --> 01:22:56,430
me to get out of there.

2999
01:22:57,180 --> 01:23:00,900
You can't tell me there's not going to
be an APP and a waving of the phones.

3000
01:23:00,901 --> 01:23:02,610
It's going to solve this problem.

3001
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:04,400
We should be out of here immediately.

3002
01:23:04,401 --> 01:23:06,010
I remember when the fast pass in

3003
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:08,890
New York pass through and
you could just drive through.

3004
01:23:08,891 --> 01:23:10,420
You didn't have to pay the tolls.

3005
01:23:10,790 --> 01:23:11,240
Amazing.

3006
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:12,340
So excited.

3007
01:23:12,341 --> 01:23:13,570
You just had to drive.

3008
01:23:13,571 --> 01:23:14,800
The main light went on.

3009
01:23:14,801 --> 01:23:15,790
You went right through.

3010
01:23:15,970 --> 01:23:20,970
It saves so much fucking
time and traffic's so much
time because traffic in New

3011
01:23:21,460 --> 01:23:24,460
York on toll booths used to be insanity.

3012
01:23:24,470 --> 01:23:25,090
No,

3013
01:23:25,090 --> 01:23:27,730
you wanted to fucking eat his shotgun.

3014
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:32,170
Have you ever rented a car in New York
and realized you didn't have the fastest

3015
01:23:32,171 --> 01:23:34,630
time through anyway written that bill?

3016
01:23:34,980 --> 01:23:35,830
That was always cool.

3017
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:37,510
I'm not staying in that.

3018
01:23:37,511 --> 01:23:38,830
Like you bill me.

3019
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:40,870
She always did the pimp mood.

3020
01:23:40,890 --> 01:23:42,280
Like he would have a
rental car and he was like,

3021
01:23:42,281 --> 01:23:42,550
what?

3022
01:23:42,550 --> 01:23:44,230
PTO drive right by.

3023
01:23:44,340 --> 01:23:45,111
It was so cool.

3024
01:23:45,111 --> 01:23:46,560
I think that's so awesome.

3025
01:23:46,790 --> 01:23:49,320
I don't give a fuck man.

3026
01:23:49,420 --> 01:23:50,500
You get a bill in the mail.

3027
01:23:50,501 --> 01:23:51,850
You pay a shit.

3028
01:23:51,851 --> 01:23:52,900
I don't even pay my bills.

3029
01:23:52,900 --> 01:23:54,140
Somebody else pays Mongo.

3030
01:23:55,100 --> 01:23:55,933
I don't even feel it.

3031
01:23:56,050 --> 01:23:59,170
You have a business guy
trying to get one of those.

3032
01:23:59,250 --> 01:23:59,980
Is it great?

3033
01:23:59,980 --> 01:24:00,491
Oh,

3034
01:24:00,491 --> 01:24:01,780
I just met a guy yesterday.

3035
01:24:01,900 --> 01:24:03,170
Well my guys,

3036
01:24:03,190 --> 01:24:04,900
a good friend that I've
had for a long time.

3037
01:24:04,901 --> 01:24:05,731
You want to know the dude?

3038
01:24:05,731 --> 01:24:08,470
This guy knows he's worked
with other good friends.

3039
01:24:08,471 --> 01:24:09,304
That helps.

3040
01:24:09,670 --> 01:24:10,503
Um,

3041
01:24:11,140 --> 01:24:13,120
but it does make your
life that much better.

3042
01:24:13,180 --> 01:24:13,361
Oh,

3043
01:24:13,361 --> 01:24:14,380
most certainly does.

3044
01:24:14,950 --> 01:24:15,131
Well,

3045
01:24:15,131 --> 01:24:16,270
it's for everything too.

3046
01:24:16,300 --> 01:24:17,980
Like if you want to buy a house,

3047
01:24:17,981 --> 01:24:19,270
if you want to buy a car,

3048
01:24:19,271 --> 01:24:20,400
if you need take,

3049
01:24:20,410 --> 01:24:21,760
take care of your bills.

3050
01:24:21,761 --> 01:24:22,720
They took care of everything.

3051
01:24:22,721 --> 01:24:26,620
They give you an itemized monthly report
every week on your phone or every month

3052
01:24:26,621 --> 01:24:28,930
and finances and you don't have to worry.

3053
01:24:28,931 --> 01:24:29,920
You have to think about anything.

3054
01:24:29,921 --> 01:24:30,430
It's great.

3055
01:24:30,430 --> 01:24:34,720
We just downstairs a lot of time
involved in being a human being.

3056
01:24:34,930 --> 01:24:37,330
That takes away from work
that you could be doing.

3057
01:24:37,331 --> 01:24:39,160
The ache actually makes you more money.

3058
01:24:39,230 --> 01:24:39,510
Right?

3059
01:24:39,510 --> 01:24:40,211
So when people say,

3060
01:24:40,211 --> 01:24:40,690
oh,

3061
01:24:40,690 --> 01:24:41,020
but it's,

3062
01:24:41,020 --> 01:24:43,240
you're giving away x amount
of percent of your income.

3063
01:24:43,510 --> 01:24:44,110
Yeah,

3064
01:24:44,110 --> 01:24:48,010
but I'm making more money because I'm
thinking more and I'm doing more sit in

3065
01:24:48,011 --> 01:24:49,030
front of my fucking computer.

3066
01:24:49,031 --> 01:24:50,800
Paying bills for hours every night,

3067
01:24:51,940 --> 01:24:52,810
writing checks,

3068
01:24:52,940 --> 01:24:53,160
track,

3069
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:53,741
keep track.

3070
01:24:53,741 --> 01:24:56,600
And remember balancing
a checkbook locked up.

3071
01:24:57,240 --> 01:25:00,190
Fuck John Ledger Ledger.

3072
01:25:00,430 --> 01:25:01,263
Yeah.

3073
01:25:02,900 --> 01:25:03,220
No,

3074
01:25:03,220 --> 01:25:03,881
I'm so.

3075
01:25:03,881 --> 01:25:06,850
I feel like so tapped out for time.

3076
01:25:07,340 --> 01:25:08,140
No,

3077
01:25:08,140 --> 01:25:09,040
I need a staff.

3078
01:25:09,041 --> 01:25:09,190
And,

3079
01:25:09,190 --> 01:25:09,581
and this,

3080
01:25:09,581 --> 01:25:14,060
this seems like good for a spot where
you're a comic and you have a family too.

3081
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:16,000
And so there's a lot of stuff.

3082
01:25:16,060 --> 01:25:16,690
This.

3083
01:25:16,690 --> 01:25:19,090
I have too many things going on for that.

3084
01:25:19,110 --> 01:25:19,690
Yeah.

3085
01:25:19,690 --> 01:25:20,171
All right.

3086
01:25:20,171 --> 01:25:21,004
I'm going to do it.

3087
01:25:22,620 --> 01:25:23,640
I'm broke.

3088
01:25:24,670 --> 01:25:24,821
Well,

3089
01:25:24,821 --> 01:25:25,540
listen.

3090
01:25:25,540 --> 01:25:27,070
Well that has happened to,

3091
01:25:27,071 --> 01:25:27,331
you know,

3092
01:25:27,331 --> 01:25:29,410
there have been guys that
have been unscrupulous.

3093
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:30,550
I remember there was a um,

3094
01:25:31,270 --> 01:25:35,560
there was an issue way back in the
day where there was an agent that was

3095
01:25:35,561 --> 01:25:37,360
stealing money from a bunch of,

3096
01:25:37,361 --> 01:25:38,590
like big name clients,

3097
01:25:38,591 --> 01:25:43,210
like Lenny Clarke got hit stolen hundreds
of thousands of dollars from him and

3098
01:25:43,211 --> 01:25:44,290
Jerry Seinfeld.

3099
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:44,650
It was like,

3100
01:25:44,650 --> 01:25:45,040
really?

3101
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:45,221
Yeah.

3102
01:25:45,221 --> 01:25:49,210
There was an agency that was going
on that was doing that for pe.

3103
01:25:49,240 --> 01:25:49,751
I forget.

3104
01:25:49,751 --> 01:25:51,580
I'll have to ask lenny
next time I see him.

3105
01:25:51,581 --> 01:25:52,090
Yeah.

3106
01:25:52,090 --> 01:25:55,630
But it was devastating for a lot of
these guys who'd lost just hundreds of

3107
01:25:55,631 --> 01:25:56,351
thousands of dollars.

3108
01:25:56,351 --> 01:25:58,120
Somebody just Dane Cook's brother.

3109
01:25:58,390 --> 01:26:00,720
Oh yeah.

3110
01:26:00,730 --> 01:26:01,421
That was bad.

3111
01:26:01,421 --> 01:26:02,620
That was really brutal.

3112
01:26:02,660 --> 01:26:03,493
In jail.

3113
01:26:03,530 --> 01:26:04,010
Yeah.

3114
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:09,010
Imagine your brother is in jail for
robbing you and they have never recovered

3115
01:26:09,110 --> 01:26:10,940
millions of that money.

3116
01:26:10,970 --> 01:26:11,091
Well,

3117
01:26:11,091 --> 01:26:12,950
there was a lot that
was owed to the irs to.

3118
01:26:13,150 --> 01:26:14,180
There's a lot o to the irs,

3119
01:26:14,181 --> 01:26:15,820
but it's also missing.

3120
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:20,920
One of his brothers stole money from him
and went on a drive across the country

3121
01:26:21,561 --> 01:26:23,720
and they don't know what the
fuck he did when he was driving.

3122
01:26:23,721 --> 01:26:27,950
He could've stopped at banks and got
security boxes under assumed names.

3123
01:26:28,420 --> 01:26:28,730
I mean,

3124
01:26:28,730 --> 01:26:32,660
I don't know how much is involved
in getting a security box at a bank,

3125
01:26:32,930 --> 01:26:34,370
but there might be shank.

3126
01:26:34,570 --> 01:26:35,371
It's very deep.

3127
01:26:35,371 --> 01:26:40,371
I mean there might be fucking coffee
cans somewhere under fence posts with a

3128
01:26:40,730 --> 01:26:41,563
million dollars rolled up in it.

3129
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:42,680
I'm gonna find it.

3130
01:26:43,570 --> 01:26:43,910
I mean,

3131
01:26:43,910 --> 01:26:47,420
have you ever seen what a million dollars
looks like in a bag of $100 bills?

3132
01:26:47,690 --> 01:26:49,510
It's not as much as you would think it is.

3133
01:26:49,580 --> 01:26:50,091
You've seen it.

3134
01:26:50,091 --> 01:26:51,050
It's like a suitcase,

3135
01:26:51,240 --> 01:26:54,410
like a small bag do is
just dig a fucking hole.

3136
01:26:54,440 --> 01:26:55,640
You throw that shit in there.

3137
01:26:56,300 --> 01:27:00,050
We just got to be able to
triangulate it on a gps and oh shit.

3138
01:27:01,060 --> 01:27:03,600
Actually get there and there's an
apartment building where the spot was.

3139
01:27:04,220 --> 01:27:05,053
Whereas

3140
01:27:07,730 --> 01:27:09,080
20 years in the big house,

3141
01:27:09,740 --> 01:27:10,790
the big house,

3142
01:27:15,620 --> 01:27:17,000
that's an awful story.

3143
01:27:17,150 --> 01:27:18,860
What's fucked up because
it was his brother too,

3144
01:27:19,010 --> 01:27:21,250
and it was any found out
after his parents passed.

3145
01:27:22,100 --> 01:27:23,390
It was brutal.

3146
01:27:23,391 --> 01:27:24,020
He also,

3147
01:27:24,020 --> 01:27:25,160
I think it was a half brother,

3148
01:27:25,161 --> 01:27:29,570
which he should be really careful of
those little Fox brothers rather than

3149
01:27:29,571 --> 01:27:30,710
trying to pretend the brother.

3150
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:32,580
What's the other half lives?

3151
01:27:32,590 --> 01:27:32,810
Yeah,

3152
01:27:32,810 --> 01:27:33,820
they have you fuck.

3153
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:35,330
But um,

3154
01:27:35,330 --> 01:27:36,740
his brother apparently,

3155
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:37,051
you know,

3156
01:27:37,051 --> 01:27:37,821
Dane was like,

3157
01:27:37,821 --> 01:27:38,450
you know,

3158
01:27:38,450 --> 01:27:38,751
I'm,

3159
01:27:38,751 --> 01:27:39,110
I'm,

3160
01:27:39,110 --> 01:27:40,670
I'm going to start investing my money,

3161
01:27:40,671 --> 01:27:41,451
all those different things.

3162
01:27:41,451 --> 01:27:43,150
I talked to this guy and his brother,

3163
01:27:43,190 --> 01:27:43,341
like,

3164
01:27:43,341 --> 01:27:43,970
Nah,

3165
01:27:43,970 --> 01:27:44,510
don't do that.

3166
01:27:44,510 --> 01:27:44,871
Don't do that.

3167
01:27:44,871 --> 01:27:45,051
Look,

3168
01:27:45,051 --> 01:27:45,560
I got this.

3169
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:46,161
I got the door.

3170
01:27:46,161 --> 01:27:47,180
I'm taking care of everything,

3171
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:48,351
making plenty of money.

3172
01:27:48,351 --> 01:27:48,620
It's like,

3173
01:27:48,620 --> 01:27:48,801
well,

3174
01:27:48,801 --> 01:27:49,740
what do you mean I'm a bug?

3175
01:27:50,100 --> 01:27:51,350
So he started asking questions.

3176
01:27:51,351 --> 01:27:51,920
Well,

3177
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:54,140
I want to get somebody to
just go over the finances,

3178
01:27:54,690 --> 01:27:55,161
got everything,

3179
01:27:55,161 --> 01:27:55,611
don't worry about it.

3180
01:27:55,611 --> 01:27:56,230
Don't worry.

3181
01:27:56,230 --> 01:27:56,690
I was like,

3182
01:27:56,690 --> 01:27:57,220
what?

3183
01:27:57,220 --> 01:27:58,280
And then he started getting like,

3184
01:27:58,281 --> 01:27:59,091
super nervous,

3185
01:27:59,091 --> 01:27:59,540
like,

3186
01:27:59,540 --> 01:28:00,380
what are you talking about?

3187
01:28:00,381 --> 01:28:00,680
And then he,

3188
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:03,170
and then he started to
get it investigated.

3189
01:28:03,171 --> 01:28:04,090
And when you've got an investigator,

3190
01:28:04,091 --> 01:28:07,190
he realized his brother
just fucking dealing.

3191
01:28:07,480 --> 01:28:08,180
Oh,

3192
01:28:08,180 --> 01:28:08,871
they went to his house,

3193
01:28:08,871 --> 01:28:11,480
he had hundreds of thousands
of dollars in his bank.

3194
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:12,913
Safe Rather.

3195
01:28:13,310 --> 01:28:13,790
Yeah.

3196
01:28:13,790 --> 01:28:15,080
After all that success,

3197
01:28:15,110 --> 01:28:16,310
he had work.

3198
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:21,560
He had money that was in plastic
bags that was frozen in tomato sauce.

3199
01:28:23,020 --> 01:28:25,520
Like he had frozen it and
put it in the freezer,

3200
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:27,500
stuffed in like these,

3201
01:28:27,560 --> 01:28:29,930
these plastic bags and
then put it in his freezer.

3202
01:28:29,931 --> 01:28:31,430
Like he was hiding money all over the.

3203
01:28:31,680 --> 01:28:32,640
Oh my God.

3204
01:28:32,690 --> 01:28:32,871
Yeah.

3205
01:28:32,871 --> 01:28:33,531
It was dark.

3206
01:28:33,531 --> 01:28:34,880
I had is crazy.

3207
01:28:35,170 --> 01:28:35,810
And it was his,

3208
01:28:35,810 --> 01:28:36,710
his own blood.

3209
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:38,130
He trusted his brother.

3210
01:28:38,131 --> 01:28:40,520
He thought his brother
and hell never fuck me.

3211
01:28:40,521 --> 01:28:41,430
But you know,

3212
01:28:41,780 --> 01:28:42,950
I guess his brother was like,

3213
01:28:43,450 --> 01:28:45,170
fucking good as noodle this money.

3214
01:28:46,150 --> 01:28:48,990
Oh see you don't even know if you

3215
01:28:51,320 --> 01:28:52,330
stole from him.

3216
01:28:52,490 --> 01:28:53,720
Oh Man.

3217
01:28:53,740 --> 01:28:54,350
Yeah,

3218
01:28:54,350 --> 01:28:55,183
it's dark.

3219
01:28:55,190 --> 01:28:56,300
That is really dark.

3220
01:28:56,410 --> 01:28:56,930
All right.

3221
01:28:56,930 --> 01:28:58,040
Maybe I'll do my own billing.

3222
01:29:01,610 --> 01:29:02,443
Yeah,

3223
01:29:02,540 --> 01:29:03,770
I don't know man.

3224
01:29:03,780 --> 01:29:06,690
It's real tricky when you're trying
to save money like that and trying to.

3225
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:07,793
Yeah,

3226
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:08,461
but that's the thing.

3227
01:29:08,461 --> 01:29:10,950
I mean if I wouldn't
stop being on top of it,

3228
01:29:11,070 --> 01:29:11,903
you know what I mean?

3229
01:29:12,450 --> 01:29:13,280
We're all my savings.

3230
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:13,741
You know what I mean?

3231
01:29:13,741 --> 01:29:16,110
Here to kind of monitor
that stuff all the time.

3232
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:16,940
You should.

3233
01:29:16,940 --> 01:29:17,890
You most certainly show.

3234
01:29:17,970 --> 01:29:18,530
Yeah.

3235
01:29:18,530 --> 01:29:19,130
Yeah.

3236
01:29:19,130 --> 01:29:19,963
You know,

3237
01:29:20,280 --> 01:29:20,780
it's all,

3238
01:29:20,780 --> 01:29:22,440
it's all for the kids.

3239
01:29:22,441 --> 01:29:23,280
It's just all like,

3240
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:25,170
it's all setting them up,

3241
01:29:25,230 --> 01:29:26,100
you know what I mean?

3242
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:28,160
And he doesn't know anything.

3243
01:29:28,161 --> 01:29:28,440
Yeah.

3244
01:29:28,440 --> 01:29:29,400
So it's all like,

3245
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,780
it's all just for the future small,

3246
01:29:32,790 --> 01:29:33,623
you know what I

3247
01:29:35,910 --> 01:29:36,061
mean?

3248
01:29:36,061 --> 01:29:38,760
That's crazy accounts where
someone could like mess with me.

3249
01:29:39,070 --> 01:29:39,300
Yeah.

3250
01:29:39,300 --> 01:29:41,100
I know people that don't
even have managers,

3251
01:29:41,130 --> 01:29:44,210
they just have an agent and they just do
everything through their agent and have

3252
01:29:44,250 --> 01:29:45,360
agents take care of everything.

3253
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:45,571
I'm like,

3254
01:29:45,571 --> 01:29:46,860
but you know,

3255
01:29:46,861 --> 01:29:47,240
like,

3256
01:29:47,240 --> 01:29:47,451
well,

3257
01:29:47,451 --> 01:29:48,271
like I'm saving money.

3258
01:29:48,271 --> 01:29:48,511
I'm like,

3259
01:29:48,511 --> 01:29:48,871
yeah,

3260
01:29:48,871 --> 01:29:49,261
you are,

3261
01:29:49,261 --> 01:29:51,330
but you have to think
about more stuff that way.

3262
01:29:51,450 --> 01:29:52,060
Right.

3263
01:29:52,060 --> 01:29:52,830
That's the.

3264
01:29:52,830 --> 01:29:54,450
I know that's really,

3265
01:29:54,451 --> 01:29:55,284
that's.

3266
01:29:55,640 --> 01:30:00,330
It sucks up so much of your brain power
just to have to go and do that stuff.

3267
01:30:00,390 --> 01:30:00,871
Also,

3268
01:30:00,871 --> 01:30:04,140
I think that if you think too
much in the financial sense,

3269
01:30:04,141 --> 01:30:05,280
like how much am I making?

3270
01:30:05,281 --> 01:30:06,270
How much more can I make?

3271
01:30:06,300 --> 01:30:07,320
I can get this out of them.

3272
01:30:07,530 --> 01:30:07,711
Well,

3273
01:30:07,711 --> 01:30:10,950
I'm going to ask for that and
hopefully I'll get like less.

3274
01:30:10,951 --> 01:30:11,551
But you know,

3275
01:30:11,551 --> 01:30:12,450
all overshoot,

3276
01:30:12,660 --> 01:30:13,160
but if you,

3277
01:30:13,160 --> 01:30:15,510
if you have all that kind of
thinking going on in your head,

3278
01:30:15,870 --> 01:30:18,300
I think that's contrary
to creative thinking.

3279
01:30:18,780 --> 01:30:21,870
I think creative thinking
is like non selfish,

3280
01:30:21,990 --> 01:30:23,090
non aware.

3281
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:23,820
Like when,

3282
01:30:23,820 --> 01:30:26,400
when I think like creatively I'm empty.

3283
01:30:26,580 --> 01:30:28,410
When I think it might sit
in front of my computer.

3284
01:30:28,410 --> 01:30:30,030
I'm not thinking about myself at all.

3285
01:30:30,031 --> 01:30:31,680
I'm thinking about the idea.

3286
01:30:31,710 --> 01:30:32,370
I'm not thinking,

3287
01:30:32,370 --> 01:30:32,550
hmm,

3288
01:30:32,550 --> 01:30:34,200
how much money can this idea make me?

3289
01:30:34,420 --> 01:30:35,070
You know?

3290
01:30:35,070 --> 01:30:35,341
Right,

3291
01:30:35,341 --> 01:30:36,174
exactly.

3292
01:30:36,570 --> 01:30:37,090
It's a.

3293
01:30:37,090 --> 01:30:39,060
that's back to the the weed thing.

3294
01:30:39,170 --> 01:30:40,003
Yes.

3295
01:30:40,110 --> 01:30:45,110
Because I really started feeling like
I'm uber responsible and I'm running this

3296
01:30:46,680 --> 01:30:49,480
company running this

3305
01:30:58,410 --> 01:30:59,970
all these human beings doing all this.

3306
01:31:00,330 --> 01:31:01,163
And I'm like,

3307
01:31:01,530 --> 01:31:03,630
I don't start smoking weed.

3308
01:31:03,690 --> 01:31:05,700
I'm going to literally turned into IBM.

3309
01:31:07,230 --> 01:31:07,870
Seriously.

3310
01:31:07,870 --> 01:31:08,110
I'm like,

3311
01:31:08,110 --> 01:31:09,600
I needed not all the time,

3312
01:31:09,601 --> 01:31:10,434
but I need to.

3313
01:31:11,220 --> 01:31:12,330
I'd like riding high.

3314
01:31:12,630 --> 01:31:17,160
I write my best stuff when I'm high
original stuff or punch up stuff both of.

3315
01:31:17,250 --> 01:31:19,140
I mean I write without it too.

3316
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:23,100
There's a lot of times when I write I
just sit down and write and sometimes

3317
01:31:23,101 --> 01:31:25,950
those ideas are great jokes
or great ideas or great bits,

3318
01:31:25,951 --> 01:31:26,550
but yeah,

3319
01:31:26,550 --> 01:31:29,000
but there's stuff that
comes to me when I'm high,

3320
01:31:29,010 --> 01:31:29,431
when I'm like,

3321
01:31:29,431 --> 01:31:31,230
this is just a gift by the universe.

3322
01:31:31,890 --> 01:31:34,520
There's just something just
came into my head that I would,

3323
01:31:34,820 --> 01:31:36,480
I don't think I would've
come up with without the.

3324
01:31:36,481 --> 01:31:39,450
We now know it kicks up in these doors.

3325
01:31:39,480 --> 01:31:40,020
Yeah.

3326
01:31:40,020 --> 01:31:40,720
I mean that was like,

3327
01:31:40,720 --> 01:31:43,080
that's like a famous quote by Carl Sagan.

3328
01:31:43,081 --> 01:31:45,120
Carl Sagan had a famous quote about,

3329
01:31:45,180 --> 01:31:47,310
about what marijuana does to you.

3330
01:31:47,430 --> 01:31:48,060
Oh yeah.

3331
01:31:48,060 --> 01:31:48,451
Yeah.

3332
01:31:48,451 --> 01:31:49,370
This is like a here.

3333
01:31:49,380 --> 01:31:50,040
I'll find it.

3334
01:31:50,040 --> 01:31:51,210
There's a famous quote.

3335
01:31:51,211 --> 01:31:51,421
I mean,

3336
01:31:51,421 --> 01:31:52,700
Carl Sagan was like,

3337
01:31:52,860 --> 01:31:53,810
uh Oh,

3338
01:31:53,850 --> 01:31:55,290
a known pothead.

3339
01:31:55,470 --> 01:31:56,200
I didn't love that.

3340
01:31:56,200 --> 01:31:56,890
Yeah.

3341
01:31:56,890 --> 01:32:00,790
I'm convinced that there are genuine
and valid levels of perception available

3342
01:32:00,791 --> 01:32:05,590
with cannabis and probably with other
drugs which are through the defects of our

3343
01:32:05,591 --> 01:32:09,550
society and our educational system
unavailable to us without such drugs.

3344
01:32:09,940 --> 01:32:12,230
Carl motherfucking Sagan.

3345
01:32:12,231 --> 01:32:13,064
Well,

3346
01:32:13,150 --> 01:32:13,990
smoking weed,

3347
01:32:14,230 --> 01:32:16,900
using the telescope lightened bitches.

3348
01:32:16,901 --> 01:32:17,830
Brain's on fire.

3349
01:32:18,250 --> 01:32:22,410
Billions and billions and
billions and billions of stars.

3350
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:24,270
You like the new cosmos?

3351
01:32:24,271 --> 01:32:24,590
Yeah.

3352
01:32:24,590 --> 01:32:24,900
Love it.

3353
01:32:24,900 --> 01:32:25,733
It's great.

3354
01:32:25,740 --> 01:32:27,790
He's amazing and it's got into it.

3355
01:32:27,960 --> 01:32:28,060
Well,

3356
01:32:28,060 --> 01:32:28,691
he's another one.

3357
01:32:28,691 --> 01:32:29,560
Neil degrasse Tyson,

3358
01:32:29,630 --> 01:32:31,060
like in making that,

3359
01:32:31,630 --> 01:32:36,630
that show has taken so much shit from
creationists and from fucking people that

3360
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:39,610
you should show the other side as well.

3361
01:32:39,730 --> 01:32:43,630
How about having a creation is
to bait you upon your program.

3362
01:32:44,770 --> 01:32:45,940
They wouldn't run it in Kansas,

3363
01:32:45,941 --> 01:32:46,460
right?

3364
01:32:46,460 --> 01:32:47,293
Yeah.

3365
01:32:48,190 --> 01:32:48,761
They literally,

3366
01:32:48,761 --> 01:32:49,990
the first week it was like,

3367
01:32:50,050 --> 01:32:50,231
oh,

3368
01:32:50,231 --> 01:32:53,270
they said it was just didn't
happen real in that second week.

3369
01:32:53,271 --> 01:32:53,560
It was like,

3370
01:32:53,560 --> 01:32:53,831
oh no,

3371
01:32:53,831 --> 01:32:55,270
this is not running.

3372
01:32:55,271 --> 01:32:55,410
It.

3373
01:32:55,410 --> 01:32:56,243
Is that true?

3374
01:32:56,350 --> 01:32:59,380
Is a station at Google?

3375
01:32:59,640 --> 01:32:59,860
Google.

3376
01:32:59,860 --> 01:33:02,150
It was like the premiere
of the Cosmos did not run.

3377
01:33:02,230 --> 01:33:03,160
And Kansas.

3378
01:33:03,830 --> 01:33:04,663
Yeah.

3379
01:33:06,430 --> 01:33:07,210
Is that true?

3380
01:33:07,210 --> 01:33:08,043
Yes.

3381
01:33:08,160 --> 01:33:08,710
God,

3382
01:33:08,710 --> 01:33:09,543
it is.

3383
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:11,110
God,

3384
01:33:11,110 --> 01:33:12,370
they didn't run the uh,

3385
01:33:13,450 --> 01:33:14,890
the premier episode and they were like,

3386
01:33:15,010 --> 01:33:18,520
they said like it was a problem with
something like the broadcast or something.

3387
01:33:18,521 --> 01:33:21,010
And then what does that false.

3388
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:21,520
False.

3389
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:22,000
False.

3390
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:22,301
Oh,

3391
01:33:22,301 --> 01:33:24,730
you fucking purveyor of bad information,

3392
01:33:24,731 --> 01:33:25,031
Tom.

3393
01:33:25,031 --> 01:33:25,864
Papa.

3394
01:33:25,880 --> 01:33:26,200
No,

3395
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:28,150
I saw an interview where he is.

3396
01:33:28,220 --> 01:33:29,840
I saw her.

3397
01:33:29,870 --> 01:33:30,780
I saw it on.

3398
01:33:30,790 --> 01:33:31,780
What's his name?

3399
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:32,310
No,

3400
01:33:32,310 --> 01:33:33,143
what's his name?

3401
01:33:33,550 --> 01:33:34,231
Talking about it.

3402
01:33:34,231 --> 01:33:35,064
Seth rogen.

3403
01:33:35,530 --> 01:33:36,700
Know the other stuff.

3404
01:33:37,210 --> 01:33:38,770
Seth Macfarlane dancing one.

3405
01:33:39,070 --> 01:33:39,581
Who's that?

3406
01:33:39,581 --> 01:33:40,710
Seth Macfarlane Mcfarland.

3407
01:33:40,950 --> 01:33:41,580
While he.

3408
01:33:41,580 --> 01:33:42,341
He's full of Shit.

3409
01:33:42,341 --> 01:33:43,890
He's probably high pending a bill.

3410
01:33:43,891 --> 01:33:45,490
It would force Fox television network.

3411
01:33:47,730 --> 01:33:48,580
It's too many words.

3412
01:33:48,581 --> 01:33:49,414
What's it say?

3413
01:33:49,560 --> 01:33:50,393
Because

3414
01:33:51,770 --> 01:33:53,050
that's about a law.

3415
01:33:53,890 --> 01:33:54,850
I'm not wrong.

3416
01:33:55,400 --> 01:33:56,081
All right,

3417
01:33:56,081 --> 01:33:56,914
thank you.

3418
01:33:57,060 --> 01:33:57,341
This is.

3419
01:33:57,341 --> 01:33:58,330
You have a cracked staff here.

3420
01:33:58,360 --> 01:33:58,521
Well,

3421
01:33:58,521 --> 01:34:00,160
he gets a lot of shit though.

3422
01:34:00,280 --> 01:34:01,031
For sure.

3423
01:34:01,031 --> 01:34:03,190
He gets a lot of shit from creationists,

3424
01:34:03,230 --> 01:34:04,060
man.

3425
01:34:04,060 --> 01:34:07,270
People that are upset with him because
he's illuminating people on the actual

3426
01:34:07,271 --> 01:34:11,260
facts and measured reality of
the Internet of the universe.

3427
01:34:11,261 --> 01:34:12,100
The universe rather.

3428
01:34:12,910 --> 01:34:15,670
George Carlin said that
he would smoke doing.

3429
01:34:15,970 --> 01:34:20,620
He would come up with his ideas straight
but then make it funnier and punch it

3430
01:34:20,621 --> 01:34:21,454
up.

3431
01:34:21,490 --> 01:34:22,323
Yeah,

3432
01:34:22,390 --> 01:34:23,710
I mean everybody's got their own method.

3433
01:34:23,750 --> 01:34:25,480
That's not a bad method because for me,

3434
01:34:25,481 --> 01:34:26,710
I like to write high as fuck.

3435
01:34:26,711 --> 01:34:29,290
Sometimes when I ride high as fuck,

3436
01:34:29,291 --> 01:34:31,780
like sometimes I'll get high as fuck
and I think I'm going to go into the

3437
01:34:31,781 --> 01:34:34,080
isolation tank and my computer just,

3438
01:34:34,081 --> 01:34:34,301
she goes,

3439
01:34:34,301 --> 01:34:34,960
come here man,

3440
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:35,291
come here,

3441
01:34:35,291 --> 01:34:36,124
sit down,

3442
01:34:36,280 --> 01:34:38,350
just sit down and start
writing on the computer.

3443
01:34:38,350 --> 01:34:39,910
And I never make it into the tank.

3444
01:34:40,120 --> 01:34:40,600
Really?

3445
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:40,871
Yeah,

3446
01:34:40,871 --> 01:34:42,260
just an idea comes.

3447
01:34:42,290 --> 01:34:42,610
Yeah.

3448
01:34:42,610 --> 01:34:47,230
And it just gets out of my head like
in these big bursts and I feel like.

3449
01:34:47,620 --> 01:34:47,861
Yeah.

3450
01:34:47,861 --> 01:34:50,530
And I feel like you gotta you
just gotTa capture those moments,

3451
01:34:50,531 --> 01:34:50,681
you know,

3452
01:34:50,681 --> 01:34:51,400
you gotta figure.

3453
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:54,190
That's why I think it's very important
for comics to be able to type.

3454
01:34:54,191 --> 01:34:58,900
Well there's a lot of comics can't they
pack and poke and you miss out on them

3455
01:34:59,090 --> 01:35:00,470
ideas because you can't write.

3456
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:02,150
Can't grab them out of
the air quicker now.

3457
01:35:02,180 --> 01:35:02,840
Yeah.

3458
01:35:02,840 --> 01:35:03,920
Do you ever write longhand?

3459
01:35:04,040 --> 01:35:04,580
No,

3460
01:35:04,580 --> 01:35:05,413
I mean I do,

3461
01:35:05,620 --> 01:35:08,170
but when I write like
it's like all this shit,

3462
01:35:08,171 --> 01:35:12,340
like during shows and stuff or have an
idea that I don't want to forget their

3463
01:35:12,350 --> 01:35:13,710
most of what it is.

3464
01:35:13,730 --> 01:35:17,380
It's just like really
quick cliff notes or um,

3465
01:35:17,570 --> 01:35:18,440
when I have a,

3466
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:21,110
my notebook that I use for shows,

3467
01:35:21,350 --> 01:35:25,040
I just write the same things
down over and over again.

3468
01:35:25,040 --> 01:35:26,120
Like if you look at my notebook,

3469
01:35:26,121 --> 01:35:28,440
I'll look like a crazy person because I'm,

3470
01:35:28,620 --> 01:35:32,040
I'm just trying to remember the order
and make sure that I get the key punch

3471
01:35:32,041 --> 01:35:32,600
lines,

3472
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:33,980
especially on new stuff.

3473
01:35:34,150 --> 01:35:37,400
It's like the shining page
after page of the same stuff.

3474
01:35:37,740 --> 01:35:40,940
It's weird to use notes on your iphone.

3475
01:35:41,120 --> 01:35:41,710
Yes.

3476
01:35:41,710 --> 01:35:42,460
You do that?

3477
01:35:42,460 --> 01:35:44,100
What is it called?

3478
01:35:44,390 --> 01:35:45,380
Mine's called Bunny.

3479
01:35:45,470 --> 01:35:45,740
No,

3480
01:35:45,740 --> 01:35:46,180
it's just,

3481
01:35:46,180 --> 01:35:47,390
it's just notes,

3482
01:35:47,420 --> 01:35:47,781
you know,

3483
01:35:47,781 --> 01:35:49,160
just this little notepad thing.

3484
01:35:49,161 --> 01:35:51,050
Like I've got one here that
I had to write yesterday,

3485
01:35:51,970 --> 01:35:55,840
but racial profiling and yeah,

3486
01:35:56,120 --> 01:35:56,950
I have a lot of them,

3487
01:35:56,950 --> 01:35:57,190
you know,

3488
01:35:57,190 --> 01:35:58,880
these are all things that
are just written down.

3489
01:35:58,900 --> 01:35:58,980
Oh,

3490
01:35:58,980 --> 01:35:59,813
they're all random.

3491
01:35:59,860 --> 01:36:01,040
Put them all in one file.

3492
01:36:01,150 --> 01:36:01,270
Oh,

3493
01:36:01,270 --> 01:36:05,480
do I put them all under funny and it's
a very low percentage of what actually

3494
01:36:05,481 --> 01:36:06,440
gets turned into a joke.

3495
01:36:06,590 --> 01:36:06,920
Right.

3496
01:36:06,920 --> 01:36:09,110
But it's like you gotta throw a
lot of shit up against the wall.

3497
01:36:09,380 --> 01:36:10,490
Do you record your sets?

3498
01:36:10,550 --> 01:36:11,150
I do,

3499
01:36:11,150 --> 01:36:11,720
yeah.

3500
01:36:11,720 --> 01:36:12,380
I record,

3501
01:36:12,380 --> 01:36:15,470
I used to use this voice memos
thing that comes with the iphone,

3502
01:36:15,820 --> 01:36:18,020
but I found that it
crashed a couple of times.

3503
01:36:18,240 --> 01:36:22,040
Fucked me and it's not good when you're
listened to it and go over stuff.

3504
01:36:22,041 --> 01:36:22,820
I'll use this one.

3505
01:36:22,820 --> 01:36:25,310
It's way more dynamic recorder.

3506
01:36:25,370 --> 01:36:25,760
No,

3507
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:26,081
it's a.

3508
01:36:26,081 --> 01:36:26,960
it's a pay one.

3509
01:36:26,970 --> 01:36:27,810
You have to pay for it.

3510
01:36:27,811 --> 01:36:32,811
It was called the VRP full vrp.

3511
01:36:33,531 --> 01:36:36,300
Seven full years.

3512
01:36:37,850 --> 01:36:38,770
Your jokes and funny.

3513
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:39,260
Well I just,

3514
01:36:39,260 --> 01:36:41,660
I worked for the one that
got the best reviews.

3515
01:36:41,930 --> 01:36:42,950
All the people that are like,

3516
01:36:43,020 --> 01:36:45,950
like serious fucking audio files.

3517
01:36:46,340 --> 01:36:46,821
This one,

3518
01:36:46,821 --> 01:36:49,460
they think it's the most
flexible as the most shit doing.

3519
01:36:50,030 --> 01:36:55,030
I record all mine through a
$1,200 a Sony Walkman move.

3520
01:36:55,570 --> 01:36:56,060
Really good.

3521
01:36:56,060 --> 01:36:59,240
High quality and such really
high quality and audio files.

3522
01:37:00,180 --> 01:37:01,370
I mean I'm a foodie.

3523
01:37:01,970 --> 01:37:05,770
Kept people in the deck when they tell
me they're a foodie and and my wife are

3524
01:37:05,780 --> 01:37:06,490
foodies,

3525
01:37:06,490 --> 01:37:08,620
but she has the fuck out of here.

3526
01:37:10,580 --> 01:37:14,290
It's like the sexiest
steaks and I love food.

3527
01:37:14,790 --> 01:37:15,320
Food.

3528
01:37:15,320 --> 01:37:16,330
Who Doesn't love food?

3529
01:37:16,340 --> 01:37:17,380
You'll call it a foodie.

3530
01:37:17,410 --> 01:37:18,290
I'm not a fucking

3531
01:37:22,270 --> 01:37:22,640
bed.

3532
01:37:22,640 --> 01:37:23,473
Pajamas.

3533
01:37:26,100 --> 01:37:29,210
It's people that are
like kind of shy about.

3534
01:37:29,560 --> 01:37:33,260
I always like or that's what
they long for more than anything.

3535
01:37:33,261 --> 01:37:35,630
It's just an element of life.

3536
01:37:35,631 --> 01:37:36,920
I'm not a wine know either,

3537
01:37:37,450 --> 01:37:38,390
but I like wine.

3538
01:37:38,750 --> 01:37:39,470
You know,

3539
01:37:39,470 --> 01:37:44,030
I'm an auction Genair we this
we need in this studio and man,

3540
01:37:44,031 --> 01:37:44,900
we need some wine.

3541
01:37:44,901 --> 01:37:46,280
We don't have any wine hideaway.

3542
01:37:46,540 --> 01:37:47,230
Big Winery.

3543
01:37:47,230 --> 01:37:48,063
We have wind.

3544
01:37:48,420 --> 01:37:49,253
Yeah,

3545
01:37:51,250 --> 01:37:52,083
the

3546
01:37:53,430 --> 01:37:54,550
wine list data.

3547
01:37:54,810 --> 01:37:56,190
That would be cool if
you had a really nice

3548
01:37:56,190 --> 01:37:59,160
wine rack on one of these
walls in here though.

3549
01:37:59,750 --> 01:38:00,640
I was going to say,

3550
01:38:00,660 --> 01:38:01,321
well we should get.

3551
01:38:01,321 --> 01:38:04,950
Is one of those wine cooler little
frigerator thingies and put some wine in

3552
01:38:04,951 --> 01:38:05,250
there.

3553
01:38:05,250 --> 01:38:09,210
I enjoy a little glass one while
while you're doing a podcast.

3554
01:38:09,211 --> 01:38:10,410
Like some podcasts.

3555
01:38:10,440 --> 01:38:11,273
It's a good idea.

3556
01:38:11,540 --> 01:38:12,373
Yeah.

3557
01:38:12,610 --> 01:38:14,220
Little whiskey on ice.

3558
01:38:14,270 --> 01:38:16,160
I thought it was gonna
be wandering here was,

3559
01:38:16,350 --> 01:38:16,940
I don't know.

3560
01:38:16,940 --> 01:38:20,850
I was watching a home and I was trying
to size up turn on the air because it is

3561
01:38:20,851 --> 01:38:21,091
hot.

3562
01:38:21,091 --> 01:38:22,650
It's sometimes sometimes you know,

3563
01:38:22,651 --> 01:38:23,940
you come to places and it's cold.

3564
01:38:24,180 --> 01:38:25,080
Well you know what it is.

3565
01:38:25,110 --> 01:38:27,270
We have a lot of electronic
equipment running.

3566
01:38:27,330 --> 01:38:27,690
Yeah,

3567
01:38:27,690 --> 01:38:29,340
he would have all that shit over there.

3568
01:38:29,930 --> 01:38:30,920
I mean,

3569
01:38:31,560 --> 01:38:32,393
cool enough,

3570
01:38:32,430 --> 01:38:32,910
right?

3571
01:38:32,910 --> 01:38:34,350
It's not like 80 in here.

3572
01:38:35,220 --> 01:38:40,080
It's like 75 or something like
three degrees above perfect

3573
01:38:41,790 --> 01:38:42,623
legs and

3574
01:38:44,940 --> 01:38:47,270
nice people in New York or eating hail

3575
01:38:48,920 --> 01:38:51,180
and those people are fucked.

3576
01:38:51,190 --> 01:38:51,931
Oh God.

3577
01:38:51,931 --> 01:38:52,560
Again,

3578
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:53,580
hitting them again right now.

3579
01:38:53,581 --> 01:38:58,260
Right now I was just in
DC and man fuck all that.

3580
01:38:58,261 --> 01:38:58,630
Just.

3581
01:38:58,630 --> 01:38:59,130
Yeah,

3582
01:38:59,130 --> 01:39:00,480
I know I can't go back.

3583
01:39:00,481 --> 01:39:01,920
I was booking shows and I was like,

3584
01:39:01,950 --> 01:39:02,940
what am I doing?

3585
01:39:02,941 --> 01:39:03,540
I'm not going.

3586
01:39:03,540 --> 01:39:05,190
I don't want to go to Ohio right now.

3587
01:39:05,191 --> 01:39:09,540
So I'm like just west visiting man.

3588
01:39:10,530 --> 01:39:11,310
Yeah,

3589
01:39:11,310 --> 01:39:12,490
visiting in the cold.

3590
01:39:12,491 --> 01:39:12,930
Like,

3591
01:39:12,930 --> 01:39:15,360
like I was in fucking Sweden in January,

3592
01:39:15,361 --> 01:39:15,720
dude.

3593
01:39:15,720 --> 01:39:18,120
Well and it's cold as shit but it was fun.

3594
01:39:18,240 --> 01:39:19,390
It's fun to stay.

3595
01:39:19,790 --> 01:39:20,750
He'd drop in,

3596
01:39:20,760 --> 01:39:21,650
you have a good time,

3597
01:39:21,700 --> 01:39:23,130
get the fuck out of dodge.

3598
01:39:23,190 --> 01:39:24,300
Pick a couple of jokes about their,

3599
01:39:24,460 --> 01:39:25,293
whether

3600
01:39:26,450 --> 01:39:27,283
dummies

3601
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:30,570
talking to joey ideas last
night and he was just like,

3602
01:39:30,571 --> 01:39:31,710
I just got back from Ohio.

3603
01:39:31,770 --> 01:39:33,270
The Sun doesn't work there.

3604
01:39:33,271 --> 01:39:34,104
It was daylight.

3605
01:39:37,160 --> 01:39:37,993
Cocksucker.

3606
01:39:39,150 --> 01:39:39,990
That's so true.

3607
01:39:40,020 --> 01:39:41,400
We're so spoiled,

3608
01:39:41,401 --> 01:39:41,731
man.

3609
01:39:41,731 --> 01:39:46,110
I know like me and the wife talked at
one point in time about living in Seattle

3610
01:39:46,140 --> 01:39:46,710
and there was,

3611
01:39:46,710 --> 01:39:47,760
we had a real discussion.

3612
01:39:47,761 --> 01:39:48,720
We even looked at a house,

3613
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:50,130
there's a house that we really liked,

3614
01:39:50,430 --> 01:39:51,120
but I'm like,

3615
01:39:51,120 --> 01:39:54,100
you gotta tell me that you can
deal with this shit because I,

3616
01:39:54,150 --> 01:39:56,190
I can deal with a lot of shit
that you can't deal with it,

3617
01:39:56,600 --> 01:39:56,851
you know,

3618
01:39:56,851 --> 01:39:58,410
I don't know if you can deal with this.

3619
01:39:58,690 --> 01:40:00,780
Like you got to be able
to deal with clouds,

3620
01:40:01,620 --> 01:40:02,340
clouds,

3621
01:40:02,340 --> 01:40:03,190
and fucking Rad.

3622
01:40:03,191 --> 01:40:04,260
I want to hear any crying.

3623
01:40:04,290 --> 01:40:05,490
It breaks strong people.

3624
01:40:11,330 --> 01:40:14,720
I'm just sad and I don't
know why I take vitamin D,

3625
01:40:14,780 --> 01:40:15,650
getting a sun bed.

3626
01:40:15,651 --> 01:40:16,484
Shut your hole.

3627
01:40:16,870 --> 01:40:17,703
I don't know.

3628
01:40:17,960 --> 01:40:20,390
The last couple of trips
I've had up to Seattle,

3629
01:40:20,810 --> 01:40:22,730
I just have hit beautiful weather.

3630
01:40:22,731 --> 01:40:25,900
It's been sunny and great
at the last three weekends.

3631
01:40:25,901 --> 01:40:26,600
I've been up there.

3632
01:40:26,600 --> 01:40:27,880
I'm in Portland weeks.

3633
01:40:28,640 --> 01:40:29,473
Right?

3634
01:40:29,480 --> 01:40:30,500
And I'm telling people,

3635
01:40:30,501 --> 01:40:30,800
I'm like,

3636
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:31,581
it's really great.

3637
01:40:31,581 --> 01:40:32,000
I mean it's uh,

3638
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:32,780
seems like that.

3639
01:40:32,780 --> 01:40:35,000
And they get this dead look
in their eyes and like,

3640
01:40:35,270 --> 01:40:36,590
it's not like this all the time.

3641
01:40:40,310 --> 01:40:42,140
Just quit Portland.

3642
01:40:42,230 --> 01:40:42,760
Oh really?

3643
01:40:42,760 --> 01:40:43,160
Yeah,

3644
01:40:43,160 --> 01:40:45,710
because I'm the chief,

3645
01:40:45,730 --> 01:40:50,330
I'm the CIO and I still
want to quit real inner.

3646
01:40:50,610 --> 01:40:52,310
You ever go to the night you said that?

3647
01:40:52,810 --> 01:40:53,591
Wow,

3648
01:40:53,591 --> 01:40:54,040
that's like a

3649
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:55,210
big gig man.

3650
01:40:55,390 --> 01:41:00,070
Doesn't make it a little bit of money
and that's not like your Tom Papa.

3651
01:41:01,650 --> 01:41:04,300
Like if you're talking
Baba Zali one time Papa.

3652
01:41:04,301 --> 01:41:05,580
If someone's a time Papa Fan,

3653
01:41:05,581 --> 01:41:06,550
if you've got to do it,

3654
01:41:07,080 --> 01:41:08,230
you got to do that job.

3655
01:41:08,260 --> 01:41:08,770
That's it.

3656
01:41:08,770 --> 01:41:11,230
But if you're a fucking
the CEO of a company,

3657
01:41:11,231 --> 01:41:11,891
like guess what?

3658
01:41:11,891 --> 01:41:13,450
Fuck face can get some.

3659
01:41:13,460 --> 01:41:15,730
There's a bunch of those
dudes waiting for that Gig.

3660
01:41:16,470 --> 01:41:17,720
The guy that's running foot locker,

3661
01:41:17,730 --> 01:41:19,630
I'd be happy to come
over and run the Nike.

3662
01:41:20,010 --> 01:41:21,670
You know the Nike store?

3663
01:41:21,671 --> 01:41:22,504
The factory?

3664
01:41:22,660 --> 01:41:23,240
Yes.

3665
01:41:23,240 --> 01:41:24,820
Well I've been to the Nike,

3666
01:41:24,821 --> 01:41:28,060
the celebrity center thing where they
take you to the place and they give you

3667
01:41:28,061 --> 01:41:28,960
the free sneakers.

3668
01:41:29,380 --> 01:41:32,230
That is the bane of my
celebrity existence.

3669
01:41:32,410 --> 01:41:33,730
What is the Nike store?

3670
01:41:33,731 --> 01:41:35,770
I can't get into the Nike store in La.

3671
01:41:35,770 --> 01:41:36,603
I don't go anymore.

3672
01:41:36,910 --> 01:41:39,430
I want it to go since the
beginning of my career.

3673
01:41:39,430 --> 01:41:39,551
Yeah,

3674
01:41:39,551 --> 01:41:40,384
I just heard about it.

3675
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:41,950
You go and you get all this free stuff.

3676
01:41:41,980 --> 01:41:42,520
Yeah,

3677
01:41:42,520 --> 01:41:43,630
I've done shows.

3678
01:41:43,631 --> 01:41:44,590
I've been at Nike.

3679
01:41:44,650 --> 01:41:46,570
I just shot a nike commercial.

3680
01:41:46,600 --> 01:41:47,470
I cannot,

3681
01:41:48,430 --> 01:41:49,120
I can't,

3682
01:41:49,120 --> 01:41:49,480
it just,

3683
01:41:49,480 --> 01:41:51,730
something always falls
apart and I can never go.

3684
01:41:51,790 --> 01:41:52,061
You know,

3685
01:41:52,061 --> 01:41:52,894
when I stopped,

3686
01:41:53,140 --> 01:41:55,500
when I felt guilty about
wearing other sneakers,

3687
01:41:55,510 --> 01:41:55,751
I'm like,

3688
01:41:55,751 --> 01:41:59,860
this is bullshit given me money and I
feel bad because I'm wearing adidas.

3689
01:42:00,390 --> 01:42:01,390
Like this is stupid,

3690
01:42:01,391 --> 01:42:02,320
so I just stopped going.

3691
01:42:02,321 --> 01:42:02,531
I'm like,

3692
01:42:02,531 --> 01:42:03,251
I'm broke.

3693
01:42:03,251 --> 01:42:03,901
I can't afford it.

3694
01:42:03,901 --> 01:42:05,020
God Damn pair of sneakers,

3695
01:42:06,890 --> 01:42:08,410
everything online.

3696
01:42:08,710 --> 01:42:12,400
I love buying shit online comes
to you don't have to go anywhere.

3697
01:42:12,600 --> 01:42:13,510
I don't have to shop.

3698
01:42:13,570 --> 01:42:15,750
That's more time out of my day.

3699
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:17,290
I don't have to dedicate.

3700
01:42:17,590 --> 01:42:21,190
I love sitting at Amazon like
with my ipad at night and going,

3701
01:42:21,280 --> 01:42:21,640
Oh,

3702
01:42:21,640 --> 01:42:23,140
I'm out of those eyedrops.

3703
01:42:23,480 --> 01:42:24,220
Bam.

3704
01:42:24,220 --> 01:42:25,330
We need more toothpaste.

3705
01:42:25,360 --> 01:42:26,080
Bam.

3706
01:42:26,080 --> 01:42:27,240
And just Ah,

3707
01:42:28,310 --> 01:42:32,020
tape today about 12
rolls of athletic tape.

3708
01:42:32,460 --> 01:42:33,220
That's great.

3709
01:42:33,220 --> 01:42:33,550
I know.

3710
01:42:33,550 --> 01:42:34,960
I just do all the heavy stuff,

3711
01:42:34,961 --> 01:42:35,800
like cat litter.

3712
01:42:35,801 --> 01:42:37,900
Go into a store and a cat litter,

3713
01:42:38,200 --> 01:42:39,040
two liters of pop.

3714
01:42:39,041 --> 01:42:40,130
Anything that's heavy that I'm like,

3715
01:42:40,150 --> 01:42:41,350
why am I carrying this?

3716
01:42:41,351 --> 01:42:42,700
I'd rather waste gas

3717
01:42:44,260 --> 01:42:46,360
pellet grills that we got
from Green Mountain Grill.

3718
01:42:46,390 --> 01:42:48,580
I just bought a fuck load of pellets.

3719
01:42:49,790 --> 01:42:50,680
The pellet grill is.

3720
01:42:50,710 --> 01:42:51,361
Oh,

3721
01:42:51,361 --> 01:42:52,194
it's glorious.

3722
01:42:52,390 --> 01:42:53,680
There's a couple companies,

3723
01:42:53,681 --> 01:42:56,090
trieger Yoder,

3724
01:42:56,230 --> 01:42:57,130
green mountain grills,

3725
01:42:57,131 --> 01:42:59,710
the one we have and
what they are is these.

3726
01:42:59,740 --> 01:43:02,460
They take these hardwood
pellets now when you know,

3727
01:43:02,461 --> 01:43:06,700
like if you save you by like this table
is made out of oak and someone had a saw

3728
01:43:06,701 --> 01:43:10,420
this table down and when you're
sawing it creates a lot of sawdust.

3729
01:43:10,630 --> 01:43:15,000
They take that sawdust and they compress
it and the natural sugars just in

3730
01:43:15,070 --> 01:43:16,000
compressing it,

3731
01:43:16,030 --> 01:43:17,720
make these things stick together and,

3732
01:43:17,721 --> 01:43:19,690
and the pellets and you
could take the pellets.

3733
01:43:19,690 --> 01:43:20,830
You kinda break them in your hand.

3734
01:43:20,831 --> 01:43:21,480
They're not like,

3735
01:43:21,480 --> 01:43:23,230
it's not like a hard piece of wood,

3736
01:43:23,440 --> 01:43:24,700
but it is a hardwood.

3737
01:43:25,210 --> 01:43:26,490
And so you take these pellets,

3738
01:43:26,491 --> 01:43:29,260
he put them into this bucket
and it's super efficient.

3739
01:43:29,470 --> 01:43:31,690
Just like a small box,

3740
01:43:31,810 --> 01:43:32,171
you know,

3741
01:43:32,171 --> 01:43:37,171
like maybe two foot square of these
will last for fucking hours and hours of

3742
01:43:37,781 --> 01:43:38,770
cooking really.

3743
01:43:38,771 --> 01:43:42,760
And it regulates the temperature
perfectly and you can grill on it.

3744
01:43:42,940 --> 01:43:44,350
It works as a smoker.

3745
01:43:44,351 --> 01:43:47,940
You can slow cook food on it and
you could load every time you grill.

3746
01:43:48,360 --> 01:43:48,730
No,

3747
01:43:48,730 --> 01:43:49,391
it's loaded.

3748
01:43:49,391 --> 01:43:50,920
It's loaded for like out.

3749
01:43:50,930 --> 01:43:53,870
It's loaded for hours and hours of cooking
and then when you want more you just

3750
01:43:53,871 --> 01:43:54,704
pour some more

3751
01:43:54,810 --> 01:43:55,321
box.

3752
01:43:55,321 --> 01:43:56,470
So you put a state guidelines.

3753
01:43:56,471 --> 01:43:57,304
If you heat it up,

3754
01:43:57,420 --> 01:44:01,590
shut it off and you turn it back on
again and it takes a couple minutes.

3755
01:44:01,591 --> 01:44:03,690
It kicks on and heats up really quickly.

3756
01:44:04,020 --> 01:44:05,070
Tastes delicious.

3757
01:44:05,071 --> 01:44:05,950
I love cooking.

3758
01:44:06,170 --> 01:44:07,790
They have an app now that
you can just tell you how,

3759
01:44:07,800 --> 01:44:08,100
what your,

3760
01:44:08,100 --> 01:44:09,060
your temperature is.

3761
01:44:10,020 --> 01:44:11,010
Do it from your phone.

3762
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:14,730
They also have other thing
that you plug into your,

3763
01:44:14,820 --> 01:44:15,631
into the meat,

3764
01:44:15,631 --> 01:44:19,050
like a meat thermometer and it registers
on the thing so you could tell exactly

3765
01:44:19,051 --> 01:44:20,850
what temperature your
food is when it's done.

3766
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:21,620
Awesome.

3767
01:44:21,620 --> 01:44:22,870
Green mountain girls is the best.

3768
01:44:22,890 --> 01:44:24,020
I love it.

3769
01:44:24,180 --> 01:44:25,800
It's all gas at the Papa House.

3770
01:44:25,801 --> 01:44:29,610
Use Gas grills festival
doesn't taste as good.

3771
01:44:29,880 --> 01:44:30,720
I generally,

3772
01:44:30,780 --> 01:44:31,170
I like it

3773
01:44:31,170 --> 01:44:33,060
to grill on lump charcoal,

3774
01:44:33,210 --> 01:44:38,210
but I'd like to slow cook
things and smoke things on the,

3775
01:44:38,440 --> 01:44:39,570
on the Green Mountain Grill.

3776
01:44:39,660 --> 01:44:40,940
What's really not good as the,

3777
01:44:40,941 --> 01:44:41,260
uh,

3778
01:44:41,260 --> 01:44:43,550
the lid of my grill is the paint spin.

3779
01:44:43,830 --> 01:44:44,663
Oh my God,

3780
01:44:45,350 --> 01:44:46,620
this thing just happened to me.

3781
01:44:46,640 --> 01:44:48,670
You can't do that for a couple of years.

3782
01:44:48,770 --> 01:44:53,490
Not that the black stuff would fall on
your chicken and your don't know if it's

3783
01:44:53,491 --> 01:44:54,620
just a grind or you don't know.

3784
01:44:54,650 --> 01:44:57,510
Let's check into that for like two years
before Green Mountain girl sent me one.

3785
01:44:57,540 --> 01:44:58,790
Do you need to get a better grip?

3786
01:44:59,920 --> 01:45:00,750
Let's get new grill.

3787
01:45:00,750 --> 01:45:01,471
That's bullshit.

3788
01:45:01,471 --> 01:45:02,660
You guys should get groups together.

3789
01:45:03,390 --> 01:45:04,223
Yeah,

3790
01:45:05,430 --> 01:45:06,263
I have.

3791
01:45:06,440 --> 01:45:08,460
You know what a big green egg is?

3792
01:45:09,060 --> 01:45:09,480
No,

3793
01:45:09,480 --> 01:45:11,730
that's like a ceramic grill.

3794
01:45:11,910 --> 01:45:12,541
It's got like,

3795
01:45:12,541 --> 01:45:14,160
it's really heavy and the ceramic,

3796
01:45:14,161 --> 01:45:15,570
the fact that it's made as ceramic,

3797
01:45:15,571 --> 01:45:19,390
it keeps in the heat and a lot of people
like smoke things and cook things that

3798
01:45:19,400 --> 01:45:20,910
I use it mostly to grill,

3799
01:45:21,090 --> 01:45:22,260
but I don't have a big green egg.

3800
01:45:22,261 --> 01:45:23,190
I have a better one.

3801
01:45:23,191 --> 01:45:24,160
It's called a Kamado.

3802
01:45:24,170 --> 01:45:25,020
It's really beautiful.

3803
01:45:25,021 --> 01:45:28,260
It's big beautiful Japanese
thing with blue tiles on it.

3804
01:45:28,620 --> 01:45:29,370
But um,

3805
01:45:29,370 --> 01:45:31,830
I use that for grilling real stakes on it.

3806
01:45:32,070 --> 01:45:33,720
But anything that I want to slow cook,

3807
01:45:33,721 --> 01:45:36,120
like the other day I did a roast
on the green mountain grill.

3808
01:45:37,390 --> 01:45:38,110
Lovely.

3809
01:45:38,110 --> 01:45:38,740
That sounds good.

3810
01:45:38,740 --> 01:45:39,041
Photos.

3811
01:45:39,041 --> 01:45:42,930
Always lovely as I'm eating lean pockets.

3812
01:45:43,970 --> 01:45:46,300
I did my first Moose roast the other day.

3813
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:48,250
Where did you get shot?

3814
01:45:48,251 --> 01:45:48,880
That bitch.

3815
01:45:48,880 --> 01:45:51,840
Where the fuck it is right there.

3816
01:45:53,350 --> 01:45:54,600
I got it in studio city.

3817
01:45:54,601 --> 01:45:57,160
It was talking shit
about him at the winter.

3818
01:45:57,230 --> 01:45:58,990
Drive talking shit about Mexicans.

3819
01:45:59,330 --> 01:46:00,163
Take it out.

3820
01:46:00,860 --> 01:46:01,160
No,

3821
01:46:01,160 --> 01:46:02,290
I shot it in Canada.

3822
01:46:02,810 --> 01:46:03,440
Here.

3823
01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:04,300
Moose hunting is like,

3824
01:46:05,070 --> 01:46:06,480
like the top of the hunting.

3825
01:46:06,690 --> 01:46:10,350
Well it's delicious meat and you
can get a moose and it'll last you.

3826
01:46:10,410 --> 01:46:13,950
I mean I have 400 pounds of
Moose meat in my freezer.

3827
01:46:13,980 --> 01:46:14,813
Oh my God.

3828
01:46:15,050 --> 01:46:16,430
Give or take a couple of pounds.

3829
01:46:16,760 --> 01:46:17,690
His face right there.

3830
01:46:17,720 --> 01:46:18,021
Oh yeah,

3831
01:46:18,021 --> 01:46:18,560
that's right.

3832
01:46:18,560 --> 01:46:19,071
That's his head,

3833
01:46:19,071 --> 01:46:19,904
right?

3834
01:46:19,950 --> 01:46:20,131
Yeah.

3835
01:46:20,131 --> 01:46:20,340
That

3836
01:46:20,340 --> 01:46:22,540
was the moose fellow.

3837
01:46:23,810 --> 01:46:24,643
He looks.

3838
01:46:25,370 --> 01:46:26,830
He's really lean right now.

3839
01:46:27,510 --> 01:46:31,200
Books for 400 pounds.

3840
01:46:31,310 --> 01:46:33,340
So it was a 900 pound animal.

3841
01:46:33,900 --> 01:46:36,360
Debone it and skin it
and cut all the meat out.

3842
01:46:36,361 --> 01:46:37,530
It's a lot of meat.

3843
01:46:37,770 --> 01:46:40,350
And so that's like 400 meals.

3844
01:46:40,410 --> 01:46:41,910
Is it really gave me or no,

3845
01:46:41,911 --> 01:46:42,660
not at all.

3846
01:46:42,660 --> 01:46:43,493
This isn't even.

3847
01:46:44,580 --> 01:46:44,900
No.

3848
01:46:44,900 --> 01:46:47,070
Moose is like a very unique flavor.

3849
01:46:47,130 --> 01:46:47,890
It's like,

3850
01:46:47,890 --> 01:46:48,960
and even deer,

3851
01:46:49,140 --> 01:46:54,000
good percentage of like diy or like what
makes it gave me is the preparation.

3852
01:46:54,720 --> 01:46:55,710
It's how people,

3853
01:46:55,740 --> 01:46:56,370
uh,

3854
01:46:56,370 --> 01:46:57,390
take care of the meat.

3855
01:46:57,470 --> 01:47:00,030
Like glands are really important.

3856
01:47:00,031 --> 01:47:04,020
You avoid like they have these things
called tarsal glands that like a down near

3857
01:47:04,021 --> 01:47:05,550
their legs and when they're in heat,

3858
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:08,160
which is most of the time when
people hunt them what it's called,

3859
01:47:08,190 --> 01:47:09,023
the Rut.

3860
01:47:09,270 --> 01:47:09,960
And it's like,

3861
01:47:09,960 --> 01:47:13,560
that's when hunting season
is legal in a lot of states.

3862
01:47:13,590 --> 01:47:15,600
If you get that stuff on the meat,

3863
01:47:15,640 --> 01:47:16,010
it'll,

3864
01:47:16,010 --> 01:47:17,730
it'll fuck with the taste of the meat.

3865
01:47:17,731 --> 01:47:18,391
I get strong.

3866
01:47:18,391 --> 01:47:18,661
Yeah.

3867
01:47:18,661 --> 01:47:19,200
If it,

3868
01:47:19,200 --> 01:47:19,711
if it's,

3869
01:47:19,711 --> 01:47:20,070
um,

3870
01:47:20,070 --> 01:47:25,070
if it decomposes or if you let it sit
in the sun too long while you're gutting

3871
01:47:25,081 --> 01:47:25,260
it,

3872
01:47:25,260 --> 01:47:26,090
that's not good to me.

3873
01:47:26,090 --> 01:47:29,730
You can go bad if the organs
get too hot while you're.

3874
01:47:30,090 --> 01:47:31,740
While you're taking care of it.

3875
01:47:32,060 --> 01:47:34,640
There's a bunch of different
variables like the fat itself.

3876
01:47:34,660 --> 01:47:38,490
You got to trim the fat off of a
dearest guide through all this.

3877
01:47:39,150 --> 01:47:40,740
There's a guy named Steve Rinella,

3878
01:47:41,160 --> 01:47:43,260
he has a show called mediator,

3879
01:47:43,660 --> 01:47:44,730
sportsmans channel,

3880
01:47:44,731 --> 01:47:46,210
and he's taken me on a.

3881
01:47:46,230 --> 01:47:49,020
He took me on my first hunt and then I
started going hunting with a bunch of

3882
01:47:49,021 --> 01:47:52,530
different people ever since
then for the last two years,

3883
01:47:52,680 --> 01:47:53,690
which just get excited about.

3884
01:47:54,340 --> 01:47:54,860
Well,

3885
01:47:54,860 --> 01:47:57,140
I was looking up because fog rock

3886
01:47:58,670 --> 01:47:59,331
has been.

3887
01:47:59,331 --> 01:48:03,560
The band has been overturned here in Los
Angeles and I was just looking to see

3888
01:48:03,561 --> 01:48:05,660
what restaurants have it and
one of my favorite restaurants,

3889
01:48:05,840 --> 01:48:07,480
they announced that they carry it.

3890
01:48:07,560 --> 01:48:08,800
Do animal this.

3891
01:48:10,320 --> 01:48:12,370
There's a place right
down the street here,

3892
01:48:12,740 --> 01:48:13,100
right?

3893
01:48:13,100 --> 01:48:14,530
Like in the next town over.

3894
01:48:14,740 --> 01:48:17,800
It's called brandywine is fucking amazing.

3895
01:48:17,801 --> 01:48:19,180
It's on Ventura Boulevard.

3896
01:48:19,181 --> 01:48:20,700
They have the best Fagua.

3897
01:48:20,740 --> 01:48:21,550
It's amazing.

3898
01:48:21,550 --> 01:48:22,600
And people who don't like,

3899
01:48:22,601 --> 01:48:23,470
fuck Fagua Oh,

3900
01:48:23,471 --> 01:48:24,820
you're an asshole.

3901
01:48:25,030 --> 01:48:26,500
Why would you eat duck liver?

3902
01:48:26,710 --> 01:48:27,100
Well,

3903
01:48:27,100 --> 01:48:28,300
why would you duck

3904
01:48:30,440 --> 01:48:31,570
asshole here?

3905
01:48:31,950 --> 01:48:35,610
Overfeeding those ducks is that worst
and shoot him in the fucking face because

3906
01:48:35,620 --> 01:48:38,880
that's what's going to happen to cutting
his head off and pluck and all his

3907
01:48:38,900 --> 01:48:39,580
feathers out.

3908
01:48:39,580 --> 01:48:41,380
What's the humane way that they,

3909
01:48:41,381 --> 01:48:42,910
I guess now are doing.

3910
01:48:43,340 --> 01:48:44,620
Is it just like a,

3911
01:48:44,720 --> 01:48:48,910
there's a lot of debate about whether
or not it's humane to create fog and in

3912
01:48:48,950 --> 01:48:51,560
the all objectively speaking,

3913
01:48:51,561 --> 01:48:55,670
it is kind of fucked up that you take
this duck and you stick his mouth into a

3914
01:48:55,671 --> 01:48:58,580
tube and then you force feed them and
that's what makes their liver swell.

3915
01:48:58,940 --> 01:48:59,773
However,

3916
01:48:59,960 --> 01:49:04,520
the reality is when you go to these
places where they have these farms,

3917
01:49:04,580 --> 01:49:06,710
when it's time for the ducks to feed,

3918
01:49:06,711 --> 01:49:09,260
they all get close to that feeder.

3919
01:49:09,860 --> 01:49:11,300
They want that food,

3920
01:49:11,540 --> 01:49:11,841
you know,

3921
01:49:11,841 --> 01:49:15,320
they probably don't want you to grab
them roughly and stick their neck on it,

3922
01:49:15,590 --> 01:49:20,120
but the the best way to do it is to not
force feed them the best way to do it,

3923
01:49:20,121 --> 01:49:22,160
as to give them an abundance of food,

3924
01:49:22,490 --> 01:49:26,300
but you're going to get a smaller liver
than if you just pour it down their

3925
01:49:26,301 --> 01:49:26,960
throat.

3926
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:27,793
I've never had it.

3927
01:49:27,920 --> 01:49:29,120
They just don't have the same.

3928
01:49:29,150 --> 01:49:31,400
They don't have gag reflexes like we do.

3929
01:49:31,401 --> 01:49:31,731
They don't.

3930
01:49:31,731 --> 01:49:32,564
It's not like.

3931
01:49:32,980 --> 01:49:33,200
I mean,

3932
01:49:33,200 --> 01:49:37,040
I'm sure they don't like being grabbed
and have their mouse stuck into a tube,

3933
01:49:37,041 --> 01:49:38,870
but they also don't like being killed now.

3934
01:49:38,871 --> 01:49:43,130
There's no humane if there's no
nice way to kill and eat meat.

3935
01:49:43,220 --> 01:49:46,280
Well is a humane way to treat them
while they're alive and that's where the

3936
01:49:46,281 --> 01:49:47,114
debate live.

3937
01:49:47,430 --> 01:49:51,580
But when the animal rights
people passed that legislation,

3938
01:49:51,581 --> 01:49:56,581
I mean you kinda realized like the agenda
of like Peta and animal rights people,

3939
01:49:56,591 --> 01:49:58,690
they don't even want you eating eggs.

3940
01:49:58,870 --> 01:50:03,870
Do you know pete on their website has
eggs listed to as a chicken's period?

3941
01:50:04,240 --> 01:50:05,650
Do you really want to eat a chicken?

3942
01:50:05,670 --> 01:50:06,100
Scared.

3943
01:50:06,100 --> 01:50:06,641
Pull that up,

3944
01:50:06,641 --> 01:50:07,250
Jamie.

3945
01:50:07,250 --> 01:50:08,083
Pulling it up because it's.

3946
01:50:08,410 --> 01:50:08,921
Oh my God,

3947
01:50:08,921 --> 01:50:09,760
it's so hilarious.

3948
01:50:09,910 --> 01:50:10,743
Now listen,

3949
01:50:10,930 --> 01:50:14,050
I'm telling you this from personal
experience because I have chickens.

3950
01:50:14,051 --> 01:50:15,970
I have 22 fucking chickens.

3951
01:50:15,971 --> 01:50:16,690
Okay.

3952
01:50:16,690 --> 01:50:19,210
And I eat eggs from my chickens everyday.

3953
01:50:19,240 --> 01:50:20,230
They are delicious.

3954
01:50:20,470 --> 01:50:21,470
And they are.

3955
01:50:21,520 --> 01:50:22,900
It's not a chicken's period.

3956
01:50:22,901 --> 01:50:23,734
Okay.

3957
01:50:23,750 --> 01:50:25,480
It's an unfertilized egg.

3958
01:50:25,481 --> 01:50:25,930
Look at that.

3959
01:50:25,930 --> 01:50:27,220
Would you eat at chickens?

3960
01:50:27,221 --> 01:50:28,054
Period?

3961
01:50:28,440 --> 01:50:28,800
Dm.

3962
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:29,680
You fuck heads.

3963
01:50:29,681 --> 01:50:32,770
Are eggs come from
chickens administration?

3964
01:50:33,070 --> 01:50:33,903
Yeah.

3965
01:50:34,130 --> 01:50:36,800
So they have the underwear.

3966
01:50:38,170 --> 01:50:39,710
That's why a bloody underwear

3967
01:50:39,740 --> 01:50:42,680
where what kind of lazy bitch
can't put a fucking Tampon in.

3968
01:50:43,460 --> 01:50:44,360
Chickens were underwear.

3969
01:50:44,450 --> 01:50:45,283
They all do.

3970
01:50:45,680 --> 01:50:46,550
Every chicken does.

3971
01:50:47,220 --> 01:50:48,053
Candy protectors.

3972
01:50:48,350 --> 01:50:48,950
They all were.

3973
01:50:48,950 --> 01:50:50,090
They were maxi pads.

3974
01:50:50,630 --> 01:50:51,620
So stupid.

3975
01:50:51,860 --> 01:50:54,560
Have you ever cracked open and
ag have found blood inside.

3976
01:50:54,740 --> 01:50:56,480
It's like a scary carrie moment.

3977
01:50:56,481 --> 01:50:58,610
That's sure to make anybody gag.

3978
01:50:58,820 --> 01:51:00,230
Clean up in aisle six.

3979
01:51:00,290 --> 01:51:00,740
Hold on,

3980
01:51:00,740 --> 01:51:02,140
fuck wrote this one.

3981
01:51:03,170 --> 01:51:03,651
Pull up the.

3982
01:51:03,651 --> 01:51:06,650
Pull up the name of this
fucking dollar in writing.

3983
01:51:06,740 --> 01:51:08,480
Do they have a name on this thing?

3984
01:51:08,570 --> 01:51:09,403
Go all the way up.

3985
01:51:10,060 --> 01:51:11,660
It doesn't say coward.

3986
01:51:12,500 --> 01:51:13,610
You wrote a bad song.

3987
01:51:13,611 --> 01:51:13,940
PD.

3988
01:51:13,940 --> 01:51:15,290
Clean up in aisle six.

3989
01:51:15,830 --> 01:51:16,670
Fuck you.

3990
01:51:17,420 --> 01:51:18,253
Dumb ass.

3991
01:51:18,910 --> 01:51:20,450
It's like a Halloween prank.

3992
01:51:20,451 --> 01:51:24,020
Gone wrong periods or what you're eating.

3993
01:51:24,021 --> 01:51:25,160
Every time you fry,

3994
01:51:25,310 --> 01:51:26,690
scramble or bake with eggs,

3995
01:51:27,410 --> 01:51:29,420
you're getting delicious.

3996
01:51:29,540 --> 01:51:30,171
Cruelty.

3997
01:51:30,171 --> 01:51:31,010
Free Protein.

3998
01:51:31,320 --> 01:51:31,850
Okay.

3999
01:51:31,850 --> 01:51:34,370
My chickens are completely free range.

4000
01:51:34,371 --> 01:51:35,750
They wander around my yard.

4001
01:51:35,870 --> 01:51:36,890
I eat their eggs.

4002
01:51:37,010 --> 01:51:37,880
Nobody gets hurt.

4003
01:51:38,380 --> 01:51:41,000
My fucking four year old
picks the chickens up.

4004
01:51:41,030 --> 01:51:41,690
Okay.

4005
01:51:41,690 --> 01:51:42,830
These chickens are fine.

4006
01:51:42,870 --> 01:51:43,700
No one's getting hurt.

4007
01:51:43,700 --> 01:51:45,410
They're going to make eggs either way.

4008
01:51:45,440 --> 01:51:46,850
There's nothing wrong girls.

4009
01:51:46,880 --> 01:51:47,331
Period.

4010
01:51:47,331 --> 01:51:47,781
Anyway,

4011
01:51:47,781 --> 01:51:49,760
this girl is just not
having any fun at all.

4012
01:51:49,790 --> 01:51:50,001
I mean,

4013
01:51:50,001 --> 01:51:51,530
that's not gross blood.

4014
01:51:51,531 --> 01:51:54,310
It's his blood that my
stake is dripping of blood.

4015
01:51:54,340 --> 01:51:55,850
I don't know that fucking bitch.

4016
01:51:57,630 --> 01:51:57,781
Well,

4017
01:51:57,781 --> 01:51:59,520
most of the states you
either actually mails,

4018
01:51:59,521 --> 01:52:00,290
believe it or not,

4019
01:52:00,290 --> 01:52:01,260
their steers,

4020
01:52:01,670 --> 01:52:02,790
they're there a bullet.

4021
01:52:02,810 --> 01:52:03,960
They cut their balls off of.

4022
01:52:04,140 --> 01:52:06,690
You're going to eat 400
pounds of Moose eventually.

4023
01:52:06,930 --> 01:52:07,210
Yeah.

4024
01:52:07,210 --> 01:52:07,340
Yeah.

4025
01:52:07,340 --> 01:52:08,270
I give some away.

4026
01:52:08,330 --> 01:52:09,163
I've given some away.

4027
01:52:09,360 --> 01:52:12,610
I've given some to my friends actually
run a restaurant of Cuban son.

4028
01:52:12,810 --> 01:52:14,130
Owe you some moves to them,

4029
01:52:14,250 --> 01:52:15,810
told them to cook it and
tell me what it tastes like.

4030
01:52:16,010 --> 01:52:16,261
Tell me,

4031
01:52:16,261 --> 01:52:16,430
you know,

4032
01:52:16,430 --> 01:52:18,030
like she's a chef.

4033
01:52:18,060 --> 01:52:18,450
Yeah.

4034
01:52:18,450 --> 01:52:18,691
Mike,

4035
01:52:18,691 --> 01:52:20,110
what kind of preparations would you use?

4036
01:52:20,111 --> 01:52:20,370
Just like,

4037
01:52:20,370 --> 01:52:21,710
let me think about this and I go look it.

4038
01:52:21,740 --> 01:52:22,573
Tell me what you going to do.

4039
01:52:23,030 --> 01:52:23,160
Yeah,

4040
01:52:23,160 --> 01:52:24,540
but I've done it a
bunch of different ways.

4041
01:52:24,541 --> 01:52:25,380
I've grilled it.

4042
01:52:25,510 --> 01:52:26,010
Like I said,

4043
01:52:26,010 --> 01:52:29,790
I marinated it and grilled it and I
marinated made a roast the other day.

4044
01:52:29,850 --> 01:52:30,870
That was kind of interesting.

4045
01:52:31,410 --> 01:52:32,243
It was delicious.

4046
01:52:32,260 --> 01:52:32,761
It was pretty good.

4047
01:52:32,761 --> 01:52:32,851
Yeah.

4048
01:52:32,851 --> 01:52:37,500
You like sear it on a frying pan and
then you cook it over like 400 degree

4049
01:52:37,501 --> 01:52:38,130
temperature for,

4050
01:52:38,130 --> 01:52:39,480
but I was like about a half an hour.

4051
01:52:40,150 --> 01:52:40,380
Oh,

4052
01:52:40,380 --> 01:52:41,213
it's amazing.

4053
01:52:41,610 --> 01:52:42,360
Yeah.

4054
01:52:42,360 --> 01:52:43,140
Moose.

4055
01:52:43,140 --> 01:52:43,291
Well,

4056
01:52:43,291 --> 01:52:44,340
the good thing about it,

4057
01:52:44,520 --> 01:52:47,780
California to appeal ruling
overturning fog band.

4058
01:52:48,140 --> 01:52:48,501
Oh,

4059
01:52:48,501 --> 01:52:49,530
they're going to

4060
01:52:51,550 --> 01:52:53,540
fuck pulling to make
a reservation tonight.

4061
01:52:53,570 --> 01:52:54,790
I am upset.

4062
01:52:55,110 --> 01:52:55,943
What are they saying?

4063
01:52:56,430 --> 01:52:57,280
What are they saying?

4064
01:52:57,281 --> 01:52:58,520
A little scroll up.

4065
01:52:58,760 --> 01:52:59,880
What is this dummy setting?

4066
01:53:00,250 --> 01:53:02,960
California California's attorney
general on Wednesday filed.

4067
01:53:02,961 --> 01:53:07,961
Notice that her office Twat will
appeal of federal judges decision that

4068
01:53:08,781 --> 01:53:10,010
overturned the states.

4069
01:53:10,011 --> 01:53:14,660
Two year ban on sales of fog was a
delicacy made from fatty duck and geese

4070
01:53:14,661 --> 01:53:15,170
liver,

4071
01:53:15,170 --> 01:53:19,490
California outlawed fog was
sales and production in 2004,

4072
01:53:19,700 --> 01:53:22,700
but for really abandoned place take,

4073
01:53:22,760 --> 01:53:25,640
take place until 2012
proponents of the band say,

4074
01:53:25,641 --> 01:53:28,160
force feeding of ducks and
geese to enlarge their livers,

4075
01:53:28,340 --> 01:53:29,960
amount to animal cruelty.

4076
01:53:30,170 --> 01:53:32,750
Critics of the band say it
infringes upon culinary freedom.

4077
01:53:33,200 --> 01:53:36,380
Effectively turning chefs into criminals.

4078
01:53:36,680 --> 01:53:37,513
Silly,

4079
01:53:37,580 --> 01:53:38,061
silly,

4080
01:53:38,061 --> 01:53:38,451
silly,

4081
01:53:38,451 --> 01:53:39,284
silly.

4082
01:53:41,740 --> 01:53:43,640
Fuck this questionable ruling.

4083
01:53:43,820 --> 01:53:48,080
California has the right to prevent the
commerce in such a cruel and inhumane

4084
01:53:48,081 --> 01:53:48,914
product.

4085
01:53:48,950 --> 01:53:51,230
All meat products are cruel,

4086
01:53:51,231 --> 01:53:51,860
inhumane.

4087
01:53:51,860 --> 01:53:56,510
You're going to have to go through every
fucking single taco bell and take out

4088
01:53:56,570 --> 01:53:57,500
all their beef,

4089
01:53:57,530 --> 01:53:58,520
all the pork,

4090
01:53:58,530 --> 01:53:59,600
all their chicken,

4091
01:53:59,840 --> 01:54:01,190
every burger king,

4092
01:54:01,191 --> 01:54:02,450
every Mcdonald's,

4093
01:54:02,451 --> 01:54:03,320
every KFC.

4094
01:54:03,321 --> 01:54:08,321
That is all animals that are treated
far more cruel than these expensive duck

4095
01:54:09,770 --> 01:54:11,100
and geese that.

4096
01:54:11,190 --> 01:54:11,771
I mean they,

4097
01:54:11,771 --> 01:54:13,580
they treat those betters factory.

4098
01:54:13,650 --> 01:54:15,650
All they're doing is
feeding them a lot of,

4099
01:54:15,920 --> 01:54:17,030
a lot of grain.

4100
01:54:17,090 --> 01:54:17,930
That's all they're doing.

4101
01:54:18,230 --> 01:54:19,190
It's not like,

4102
01:54:19,250 --> 01:54:19,551
you know,

4103
01:54:19,551 --> 01:54:24,551
this idea that this is like a uniquely
cruel thing and then if you ban this,

4104
01:54:24,890 --> 01:54:27,560
all the other things that
you see are not as bad.

4105
01:54:27,561 --> 01:54:27,711
No.

4106
01:54:27,711 --> 01:54:29,690
All the other things
you see are way worse.

4107
01:54:30,230 --> 01:54:30,650
They,

4108
01:54:30,650 --> 01:54:31,640
they cut chickens,

4109
01:54:31,641 --> 01:54:35,690
beaks off when they're babies so that
they don't peck each other's eyeballs off

4110
01:54:35,691 --> 01:54:37,520
because they're in such close quarters,

4111
01:54:37,640 --> 01:54:39,320
stuffed into these little cages.

4112
01:54:39,440 --> 01:54:40,340
That's all legal.

4113
01:54:40,520 --> 01:54:41,630
If they want to make something,

4114
01:54:41,720 --> 01:54:44,180
what they should do is
have everything free range.

4115
01:54:44,210 --> 01:54:45,021
Everything should be free.

4116
01:54:45,021 --> 01:54:46,550
Range pork should be free.

4117
01:54:46,551 --> 01:54:47,930
Range chicken should be free.

4118
01:54:47,931 --> 01:54:49,220
Range beef should be free range.

4119
01:54:49,880 --> 01:54:53,960
You should have an allotted amount of
land that you have to own for a certain

4120
01:54:53,961 --> 01:54:54,651
amount of chickens,

4121
01:54:54,651 --> 01:54:55,700
a certain amount of cows,

4122
01:54:55,701 --> 01:54:56,534
a certain amount of beef,

4123
01:54:56,720 --> 01:54:59,560
but then you're going to have
problems with coyotes because I have.

4124
01:54:59,570 --> 01:55:00,730
I have a coyote,

4125
01:55:00,900 --> 01:55:03,890
I've had two chickens get killed
by coyotes and one by my dog.

4126
01:55:04,140 --> 01:55:05,510
So fucking man,

4127
01:55:05,511 --> 01:55:05,800
man,

4128
01:55:05,800 --> 01:55:06,440
it looked.

4129
01:55:06,440 --> 01:55:06,820
They.

4130
01:55:06,820 --> 01:55:10,160
They find a way to get to them
and if you have a big farm,

4131
01:55:10,310 --> 01:55:14,480
you're going to have to have sheep dogs
that run around or some sort of dog that

4132
01:55:14,481 --> 01:55:15,890
keeps the coyotes away.

4133
01:55:16,040 --> 01:55:16,311
I mean,

4134
01:55:16,311 --> 01:55:18,080
you're going to have
to change agriculture.

4135
01:55:18,081 --> 01:55:20,720
You have to change lives
to it at that level,

4136
01:55:20,780 --> 01:55:21,613
that mass.

4137
01:55:21,620 --> 01:55:25,070
That's the only way to stop animal
cruelty when it comes to livestock.

4138
01:55:25,071 --> 01:55:26,210
And if they don't do that,

4139
01:55:26,240 --> 01:55:27,110
then they're hypocritical.

4140
01:55:27,111 --> 01:55:27,950
This is silliness.

4141
01:55:28,270 --> 01:55:29,450
This is so many food.

4142
01:55:29,451 --> 01:55:29,631
Right?

4143
01:55:29,631 --> 01:55:29,991
Exactly.

4144
01:55:29,991 --> 01:55:32,990
The only force feeding them in
such a small scale compared to.

4145
01:55:34,010 --> 01:55:34,790
And it's delicious.

4146
01:55:34,790 --> 01:55:35,920
Oh fuck.

4147
01:55:35,930 --> 01:55:36,141
Well,

4148
01:55:36,141 --> 01:55:39,200
so buttery going tonight is the restroom.

4149
01:55:39,210 --> 01:55:39,530
Yeah,

4150
01:55:39,530 --> 01:55:40,670
go use the restroom.

4151
01:55:40,671 --> 01:55:40,941
Tom.

4152
01:55:40,941 --> 01:55:43,440
Papa can go through that door
and do your little business.

4153
01:55:43,970 --> 01:55:44,820
I

4154
01:55:45,030 --> 01:55:45,863
just.

4155
01:55:46,130 --> 01:55:46,410
Yeah,

4156
01:55:46,410 --> 01:55:47,243
we got paper.

4157
01:55:47,640 --> 01:55:48,500
If you take a shit though,

4158
01:55:48,501 --> 01:55:49,830
warned us and keep the fan on.

4159
01:55:51,720 --> 01:55:52,553
He's a funny guy.

4160
01:55:53,070 --> 01:55:54,600
I never met him before today.

4161
01:55:54,720 --> 01:55:56,520
I didn't know he was in so many movies.

4162
01:55:56,521 --> 01:55:59,880
He's been in a movie with
Matt Damon before the,

4163
01:56:00,380 --> 01:56:02,470
I forget what the name of it was a,

4164
01:56:03,030 --> 01:56:05,300
but he's been in a lot of tv
shows and stuff like that.

4165
01:56:05,960 --> 01:56:06,793
He had,

4166
01:56:07,280 --> 01:56:08,220
he had that show.

4167
01:56:08,260 --> 01:56:08,790
Oh yeah,

4168
01:56:08,790 --> 01:56:09,623
that was a good movie.

4169
01:56:09,810 --> 01:56:10,643
He had that show.

4170
01:56:10,740 --> 01:56:13,060
The wedding counselor,

4171
01:56:13,061 --> 01:56:15,060
a marriage counselor
or something like that.

4172
01:56:15,120 --> 01:56:15,870
Yeah.

4173
01:56:15,870 --> 01:56:16,260
Where he's like,

4174
01:56:16,260 --> 01:56:17,093
what was it called?

4175
01:56:17,130 --> 01:56:18,330
The uh,

4176
01:56:18,360 --> 01:56:20,280
marriage marriage.

4177
01:56:20,350 --> 01:56:21,183
Ralph,

4178
01:56:21,730 --> 01:56:22,590
where he was like,

4179
01:56:23,100 --> 01:56:27,120
that's a job you don't want trying to
get people to fucking work their marriage

4180
01:56:27,121 --> 01:56:27,954
out.

4181
01:56:27,960 --> 01:56:28,440
Fun.

4182
01:56:28,440 --> 01:56:29,273
Break up.

4183
01:56:29,910 --> 01:56:30,690
Try again.

4184
01:56:30,690 --> 01:56:31,710
You're a new person now.

4185
01:56:31,770 --> 01:56:32,670
Try it one more time.

4186
01:56:32,850 --> 01:56:33,840
That was the quickest tinkle.

4187
01:56:33,841 --> 01:56:34,970
Every we do in blow in there.

4188
01:56:34,980 --> 01:56:35,650
Dude,

4189
01:56:35,650 --> 01:56:37,280
did you do blow in there now?

4190
01:56:37,290 --> 01:56:38,670
But I washed my hands and everything.

4191
01:56:38,970 --> 01:56:39,510
Wow.

4192
01:56:39,510 --> 01:56:40,290
That's incredible.

4193
01:56:40,290 --> 01:56:40,740
Fuck,

4194
01:56:40,740 --> 01:56:41,830
how the fuck did you do that?

4195
01:56:42,780 --> 01:56:43,650
Did you peer shit?

4196
01:56:44,200 --> 01:56:44,440
I'm like,

4197
01:56:44,440 --> 01:56:44,791
Oh shit,

4198
01:56:44,791 --> 01:56:45,950
here you can sit here.

4199
01:56:46,960 --> 01:56:50,730
I would never have shit outside of
my own house with twice in my life.

4200
01:56:50,760 --> 01:56:51,593
Are you serious?

4201
01:56:51,900 --> 01:56:52,111
Dude?

4202
01:56:52,111 --> 01:56:53,400
I'll shit in the parking lot if I have.

4203
01:56:55,800 --> 01:56:57,780
I really don't feel very infrequent.

4204
01:56:57,781 --> 01:56:58,200
Yeah.

4205
01:56:58,200 --> 01:57:01,050
Well that show the marriage
rough that you did.

4206
01:57:01,051 --> 01:57:01,590
Yes.

4207
01:57:01,590 --> 01:57:02,640
Was that a nightmare?

4208
01:57:02,641 --> 01:57:04,800
Like talking to people about
the relationship troubles?

4209
01:57:05,220 --> 01:57:05,851
No,

4210
01:57:05,851 --> 01:57:07,080
that part was okay.

4211
01:57:07,800 --> 01:57:08,730
Talking to the real people.

4212
01:57:08,731 --> 01:57:09,564
It was fine.

4213
01:57:09,930 --> 01:57:14,580
It was trying to do a comedy show
with celebrities that weren't funny

4214
01:57:17,380 --> 01:57:19,830
staring into the eyes of
Donald Trump or gloria,

4215
01:57:19,831 --> 01:57:20,570
stefan.

4216
01:57:20,570 --> 01:57:21,450
Oh,

4217
01:57:21,451 --> 01:57:23,940
you're trying to get some
funny conversation going.

4218
01:57:24,030 --> 01:57:24,451
That was.

4219
01:57:24,451 --> 01:57:28,980
I could talk to regular people about
their relationships all night and day.

4220
01:57:29,010 --> 01:57:30,690
What was and have fun and interesting.

4221
01:57:30,720 --> 01:57:31,321
What was the bay?

4222
01:57:31,321 --> 01:57:31,860
I didn't,

4223
01:57:31,860 --> 01:57:32,693
I never saw it.

4224
01:57:32,730 --> 01:57:33,181
It was,

4225
01:57:33,181 --> 01:57:33,710
uh,

4226
01:57:33,710 --> 01:57:34,300
it was,

4227
01:57:34,300 --> 01:57:39,300
it was a good core idea of Seinfeld's
that when married couples get in fights,

4228
01:57:40,800 --> 01:57:43,740
the fights will last
forever because you know,

4229
01:57:43,770 --> 01:57:44,240
you both,

4230
01:57:44,240 --> 01:57:46,190
you're not really giving
in and solving the problem.

4231
01:57:46,210 --> 01:57:47,760
You just kind of hunker down.

4232
01:57:48,060 --> 01:57:49,230
But if you have a friend,

4233
01:57:49,620 --> 01:57:50,700
you can happened with him.

4234
01:57:50,701 --> 01:57:50,910
He,

4235
01:57:50,910 --> 01:57:54,330
him and his wife were in a fight and
he had a friend over and he said,

4236
01:57:54,540 --> 01:57:55,410
Jerry said to him,

4237
01:57:55,590 --> 01:57:58,860
will you please listen to both sides
and you tell us who's right and who's

4238
01:57:58,861 --> 01:57:59,340
wrong,

4239
01:57:59,340 --> 01:58:02,130
and the friend listen to and it
says you were right and she's wrong,

4240
01:58:02,140 --> 01:58:02,880
whatever.

4241
01:58:02,880 --> 01:58:05,880
And he thought this was a funny
thing for a show for married couples.

4242
01:58:05,881 --> 01:58:06,990
Have there you have these fights at last,

4243
01:58:06,991 --> 01:58:11,991
their whole marriage have a marriage ref
weigh in and say whether it's right or

4244
01:58:13,231 --> 01:58:14,730
wrong and uh,

4245
01:58:15,800 --> 01:58:16,830
it's at its core,

4246
01:58:16,831 --> 01:58:18,030
it's like a pretty good idea.

4247
01:58:18,031 --> 01:58:19,440
But then there's so many moving.

4248
01:58:19,470 --> 01:58:19,890
He was like,

4249
01:58:19,890 --> 01:58:20,760
part reality.

4250
01:58:20,761 --> 01:58:21,960
There was a talk show.

4251
01:58:21,961 --> 01:58:25,620
Then you had three celebrities weighing
in and giving their opinion on it.

4252
01:58:25,621 --> 01:58:29,180
And then it just became
too many moving parts.

4253
01:58:29,520 --> 01:58:31,200
Celebrities are goofy idea.

4254
01:58:31,470 --> 01:58:32,040
Yeah.

4255
01:58:32,040 --> 01:58:36,810
Because especially like
a lot of celebrities will
pretend they have an opinion

4256
01:58:36,811 --> 01:58:39,640
that's different than they really
have just in order to be like,

4257
01:58:39,750 --> 01:58:44,290
to get Brownie points sort of sound
like it's the right thing to say.

4258
01:58:44,320 --> 01:58:44,531
Right.

4259
01:58:44,531 --> 01:58:45,290
Or just to

4260
01:58:45,290 --> 01:58:46,430
make noise on TV,

4261
01:58:46,431 --> 01:58:48,020
just to be saying something.

4262
01:58:48,021 --> 01:58:50,800
And then it became a booking
nightmare because the,

4263
01:58:50,950 --> 01:58:55,950
it went through Jerry's Rolodex at first
it was like all these really famous

4264
01:58:56,150 --> 01:59:00,800
fund people that he knew like how Baldwin
and Larry David and Madonna and all

4265
01:59:00,801 --> 01:59:01,634
these crazy people.

4266
01:59:01,760 --> 01:59:03,460
And then they,

4267
01:59:04,030 --> 01:59:04,550
it was,

4268
01:59:04,550 --> 01:59:07,040
it wasn't going to just keep
asking friends and stuff.

4269
01:59:07,041 --> 01:59:11,070
And then the next year it was
like the level of went to Helen.

4270
01:59:11,140 --> 01:59:11,973
It was like,

4271
01:59:12,320 --> 01:59:12,531
you know,

4272
01:59:12,531 --> 01:59:13,490
you can't get those kinds of.

4273
01:59:13,510 --> 01:59:16,340
The network wanted Madonna
every week and you know,

4274
01:59:16,370 --> 01:59:20,090
you're getting some road comic
or something like I'm in.

4275
01:59:21,070 --> 01:59:24,270
That part became Kinda wiggy yeah.

4276
01:59:25,380 --> 01:59:27,490
Counting on celebrity guests.

4277
01:59:27,640 --> 01:59:28,510
It's rough.

4278
01:59:28,540 --> 01:59:29,740
Like celebrity apprentice.

4279
01:59:29,860 --> 01:59:30,970
How long can they do that?

4280
01:59:30,971 --> 01:59:31,151
I mean,

4281
01:59:31,151 --> 01:59:32,710
they're totally out of celebrities,

4282
01:59:32,711 --> 01:59:33,070
right?

4283
01:59:33,070 --> 01:59:34,060
Celebrity apprentice.

4284
01:59:34,610 --> 01:59:34,900
Yeah.

4285
01:59:34,900 --> 01:59:35,770
My way to the store.

4286
01:59:35,771 --> 01:59:40,000
The other night I've looked
at the billboard on Laurel
and I don't know who any

4287
01:59:40,001 --> 01:59:40,834
of those ones.

4288
01:59:43,830 --> 01:59:45,460
They offered that shit to me when I was,

4289
01:59:45,520 --> 01:59:47,230
when we were rebooting fear factor.

4290
01:59:47,231 --> 01:59:47,801
And I was like,

4291
01:59:47,801 --> 01:59:48,634
what?

4292
01:59:49,640 --> 01:59:50,473
No.

4293
01:59:50,600 --> 01:59:51,131
Then they're like,

4294
01:59:51,131 --> 01:59:51,371
yeah,

4295
01:59:51,371 --> 01:59:52,930
you got to live in New
York for two months.

4296
01:59:52,931 --> 01:59:53,764
I would get the fuck.

4297
01:59:53,890 --> 01:59:54,330
And then I,

4298
01:59:54,330 --> 01:59:54,690
my,

4299
01:59:54,690 --> 01:59:55,780
I talked to my wife and I'm like,

4300
01:59:55,781 --> 01:59:57,330
it might be fun to be
in New York for what?

4301
01:59:57,860 --> 01:59:59,540
I can fucking just go to New York.

4302
02:00:00,040 --> 02:00:03,680
I don't want to be on this stupid
fucking show and have him say yo fired.

4303
02:00:03,730 --> 02:00:04,563
Is the money,

4304
02:00:04,780 --> 02:00:05,980
is the money so good.

4305
02:00:06,070 --> 02:00:07,480
That's why they get these people.

4306
02:00:07,540 --> 02:00:08,370
They offer good money.

4307
02:00:08,370 --> 02:00:09,000
It is good.

4308
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:10,240
It was a good chunk of change.

4309
02:00:10,620 --> 02:00:11,351
It was real money.

4310
02:00:11,351 --> 02:00:12,190
I was kind of surprised.

4311
02:00:12,970 --> 02:00:13,500
It has.

4312
02:00:13,500 --> 02:00:14,740
It's been around forever.

4313
02:00:15,010 --> 02:00:17,800
You have for two months they were
going to give you like a real fucking,

4314
02:00:18,400 --> 02:00:19,660
a big slice,

4315
02:00:20,190 --> 02:00:21,510
a nice slice hat.

4316
02:00:21,570 --> 02:00:22,361
That's the only way.

4317
02:00:22,361 --> 02:00:23,260
I mean it's,

4318
02:00:23,261 --> 02:00:23,880
you know,

4319
02:00:23,880 --> 02:00:27,320
it's still not worth not worth it because
you're going to be stuck there and

4320
02:00:27,330 --> 02:00:28,360
you're going to have to do that.

4321
02:00:29,410 --> 02:00:32,260
But for people that are trying to
like really like I know Penn Jillette,

4322
02:00:32,940 --> 02:00:34,570
he found that when he did it,

4323
02:00:34,780 --> 02:00:35,920
like all these people,

4324
02:00:35,921 --> 02:00:39,310
like they got more people to
the show at the Rio really.

4325
02:00:39,520 --> 02:00:39,791
You know,

4326
02:00:39,791 --> 02:00:40,900
they have a weekly show.

4327
02:00:40,901 --> 02:00:41,860
They're there every week.

4328
02:00:41,861 --> 02:00:44,350
Penn and teller at the
Rio in Vegas every week,

4329
02:00:44,351 --> 02:00:48,190
every week and he kind of has to do
things outside of that in order to alert

4330
02:00:48,191 --> 02:00:52,000
people that are there and he said
it was very effective for that.

4331
02:00:52,030 --> 02:00:52,720
Yeah,

4332
02:00:52,720 --> 02:00:53,380
I guess.

4333
02:00:53,380 --> 02:00:54,730
I guess it's just a personal thing,

4334
02:00:54,731 --> 02:00:59,731
like I couldn't sit and look at Donald
trump and I just fired jetson that big

4335
02:01:01,991 --> 02:01:02,840
face and that

4336
02:01:04,530 --> 02:01:05,320
I couldn't,

4337
02:01:05,320 --> 02:01:06,280
but the marriage with was.

4338
02:01:06,520 --> 02:01:07,150
It was,

4339
02:01:07,150 --> 02:01:07,871
it was okay.

4340
02:01:07,871 --> 02:01:08,770
It was just chaos.

4341
02:01:08,771 --> 02:01:11,560
It was crazy producer
and it's crazy producer.

4342
02:01:11,680 --> 02:01:12,790
Those are great.

4343
02:01:13,290 --> 02:01:16,960
Wishes are great or not so stupid
ideas that you have to listen to.

4344
02:01:18,340 --> 02:01:21,670
It was crazy fighting with the
network and all this and saying,

4345
02:01:21,700 --> 02:01:21,940
oh,

4346
02:01:21,940 --> 02:01:22,660
what did the network?

4347
02:01:22,660 --> 02:01:24,090
It was supposed to be
like this nice little.

4348
02:01:24,330 --> 02:01:28,320
I show Jerry wanted to do this little
kid who's going to be like a Sunday night

4349
02:01:28,321 --> 02:01:32,250
show and just kind of like slowly
bring it out and let's just for married

4350
02:01:32,251 --> 02:01:32,641
people,

4351
02:01:32,641 --> 02:01:33,474
that's all it was.

4352
02:01:33,750 --> 02:01:38,750
And then Leno's primetime tanked and
they called Jerry and they were like,

4353
02:01:39,620 --> 02:01:41,630
we want you to save Thursday nights.

4354
02:01:42,350 --> 02:01:47,350
We're going put it on Thursday at 10
Seinfeld returns to Thursday nights and I

4355
02:01:48,801 --> 02:01:50,630
don't know if you remember
watching the Olympics that year.

4356
02:01:50,660 --> 02:01:51,920
They were every.

4357
02:01:51,950 --> 02:01:55,730
They were just kept pumping and
pumping it the greatest show.

4358
02:01:55,731 --> 02:01:56,570
Jerry's back,

4359
02:01:56,571 --> 02:02:01,571
the biggest comedy shadow every break of
the of the Olympics to the point where

4360
02:02:02,990 --> 02:02:06,560
when they had the final
ceremonies for the Olympics,

4361
02:02:07,040 --> 02:02:08,210
they cut it off.

4362
02:02:08,480 --> 02:02:12,320
Someone was in like mid singing made
Canadian song and they were like,

4363
02:02:12,470 --> 02:02:13,303
boop,

4364
02:02:13,420 --> 02:02:14,253
the marriage.

4365
02:02:15,490 --> 02:02:16,323
We're like,

4366
02:02:16,480 --> 02:02:17,313
oh,

4367
02:02:17,920 --> 02:02:19,560
this is not what you told us.

4368
02:02:19,870 --> 02:02:22,330
This is not the best
comedy thing of all time.

4369
02:02:22,480 --> 02:02:24,700
And they really came after it too much,

4370
02:02:25,300 --> 02:02:26,290
way too much.

4371
02:02:27,580 --> 02:02:29,520
We didn't even know we were doing it.

4372
02:02:29,620 --> 02:02:30,850
We didn't know what it was yet.

4373
02:02:30,940 --> 02:02:31,100
Yeah,

4374
02:02:31,100 --> 02:02:32,500
you got to let those things grow.

4375
02:02:32,501 --> 02:02:33,120
Right.

4376
02:02:33,120 --> 02:02:33,790
And they're like,

4377
02:02:33,790 --> 02:02:35,050
we were talking about with jokes,

4378
02:02:35,080 --> 02:02:35,440
you know,

4379
02:02:35,440 --> 02:02:39,270
getting the first draft on
NBC pumped up by the Olympics.

4380
02:02:39,400 --> 02:02:40,233
Totally.

4381
02:02:40,240 --> 02:02:41,650
It was so annoying.

4382
02:02:41,680 --> 02:02:43,240
Like I would watch the
Olympics and be like,

4383
02:02:43,270 --> 02:02:43,520
alright,

4384
02:02:43,520 --> 02:02:45,910
well I can't watch enough of these promos.

4385
02:02:48,340 --> 02:02:49,450
Letterman did a thing,

4386
02:02:49,540 --> 02:02:50,620
one of his top tens.

4387
02:02:50,680 --> 02:02:51,011
Remember,

4388
02:02:51,011 --> 02:02:51,561
that was the year,

4389
02:02:51,561 --> 02:02:52,420
like someone went off,

4390
02:02:52,640 --> 02:02:53,220
uh,

4391
02:02:53,220 --> 02:02:56,950
in not the Toboggan lift go lose or
something when flying off the side or

4392
02:02:56,951 --> 02:02:57,580
something,

4393
02:02:57,580 --> 02:03:00,550
and it was like the top 10 things that
he thought right before he crashed or

4394
02:03:00,551 --> 02:03:01,120
something.

4395
02:03:01,120 --> 02:03:04,240
And one was no more marriage
prep promos or something.

4396
02:03:05,490 --> 02:03:06,610
Did someone die?

4397
02:03:06,910 --> 02:03:07,301
Yeah,

4398
02:03:07,301 --> 02:03:08,530
I don't think it was the dead guy.

4399
02:03:08,820 --> 02:03:09,170
Yeah.

4400
02:03:09,170 --> 02:03:10,990
He wouldn't have done a
top 10 off the dead guy.

4401
02:03:11,200 --> 02:03:14,890
He might've maybe depending on where
his life was at at that moment.

4402
02:03:14,910 --> 02:03:15,260
Yeah.

4403
02:03:15,260 --> 02:03:16,060
Good point.

4404
02:03:16,060 --> 02:03:16,900
But it was a,

4405
02:03:17,110 --> 02:03:17,740
you know,

4406
02:03:17,740 --> 02:03:20,100
you just kind of get swept
into those things and just,

4407
02:03:20,200 --> 02:03:22,420
it was fun to have a show
for a couple of years.

4408
02:03:22,780 --> 02:03:24,220
Do you want to do something else now?

4409
02:03:24,310 --> 02:03:25,150
What are you doing that for?

4410
02:03:25,151 --> 02:03:25,930
Sure,

4411
02:03:25,930 --> 02:03:26,763
for sure.

4412
02:03:26,920 --> 02:03:27,753
I'm a,

4413
02:03:28,060 --> 02:03:29,030
I'm acting on the nick.

4414
02:03:29,080 --> 02:03:31,120
I have a couple of episodes
coming against the nick.

4415
02:03:31,200 --> 02:03:34,210
Nick is soderbergh's new
show with Clive Owen.

4416
02:03:34,900 --> 02:03:36,610
It's about a hospital in,

4417
02:03:36,630 --> 02:03:36,970
uh,

4418
02:03:36,970 --> 02:03:40,000
in New York in 1910 and uh,

4419
02:03:40,540 --> 02:03:41,410
it's really good.

4420
02:03:42,330 --> 02:03:44,030
Is it a comedy or is it a drama?

4421
02:03:44,031 --> 02:03:45,930
It's a drama and uh,

4422
02:03:46,310 --> 02:03:47,580
he's Clive Owen's May.

4423
02:03:47,630 --> 02:03:48,170
It's great.

4424
02:03:48,170 --> 02:03:48,651
It's really,

4425
02:03:48,651 --> 02:03:49,431
really well done.

4426
02:03:49,431 --> 02:03:50,030
This is it.

4427
02:03:50,030 --> 02:03:50,870
Oh whoa.

4428
02:03:50,930 --> 02:03:51,410
Yeah.

4429
02:03:51,410 --> 02:03:52,310
It's so good.

4430
02:03:52,490 --> 02:03:55,730
Modern medicine had to start
somewhere and soderbergh does it,

4431
02:03:56,380 --> 02:03:56,750
you know,

4432
02:03:56,750 --> 02:03:58,070
do a lot of stuff with soderbergh.

4433
02:03:58,310 --> 02:04:02,720
That really looks to me like
that scene in that movie.

4434
02:04:02,721 --> 02:04:03,650
The wolf man,

4435
02:04:03,830 --> 02:04:05,360
the most recent one with.

4436
02:04:05,361 --> 02:04:06,470
What the fuck is his name?

4437
02:04:06,830 --> 02:04:07,663
What's it?

4438
02:04:08,960 --> 02:04:09,830
Benicio del Toro.

4439
02:04:11,170 --> 02:04:12,590
Toro was the wolf man.

4440
02:04:12,620 --> 02:04:12,981
Oh yeah.

4441
02:04:12,981 --> 02:04:16,670
And they did an experiment on him and he
fucking turned into the wolf man in the

4442
02:04:16,671 --> 02:04:17,504
middle of the.

4443
02:04:17,750 --> 02:04:22,750
That's like one of them old school Lee
Auditorium type where they would operate

4444
02:04:23,130 --> 02:04:25,430
in medical school where
they do operations.

4445
02:04:25,460 --> 02:04:25,641
Oh,

4446
02:04:25,641 --> 02:04:26,240
it's so like.

4447
02:04:26,240 --> 02:04:29,990
And he's like addicted to cocaine and at
the end of the first season they treat

4448
02:04:29,991 --> 02:04:32,960
them for cocaine madness because
it's all legal back then.

4449
02:04:33,220 --> 02:04:35,120
They just a treatment for cocaine madness.

4450
02:04:35,121 --> 02:04:35,980
They give them heroin.

4451
02:04:36,280 --> 02:04:38,400
This is on cinemax?

4452
02:04:38,400 --> 02:04:38,790
Yeah.

4453
02:04:38,790 --> 02:04:40,800
I didn't even know cinemax still existed.

4454
02:04:40,860 --> 02:04:41,980
I know this is like,

4455
02:04:42,520 --> 02:04:44,820
this is like the only real be real.

4456
02:04:45,260 --> 02:04:48,810
It goes from this kind of been quiet,

4457
02:04:48,870 --> 02:04:49,141
right?

4458
02:04:49,141 --> 02:04:49,740
Yeah.

4459
02:04:49,740 --> 02:04:53,010
But I only did a couple episodes and I
have another couple coming up in the next

4460
02:04:53,010 --> 02:04:53,843
season.

4461
02:04:54,620 --> 02:04:56,940
But it's live and kicking.

4462
02:04:56,970 --> 02:04:57,181
Man.

4463
02:04:57,181 --> 02:04:58,014
This is a good show.

4464
02:04:58,200 --> 02:05:02,790
Showtime was dead in the fucking water
until shit like dexter now and now they

4465
02:05:02,791 --> 02:05:03,570

I love that show.

4470
02:05:11,980 --> 02:05:13,440
It's a fucking great show.

4471
02:05:13,710 --> 02:05:13,981
Yeah.

4472
02:05:13,981 --> 02:05:14,160
No,

4473
02:05:14,160 --> 02:05:14,560
it's good.

4474
02:05:14,560 --> 02:05:15,240
Silent Cinema.

4475
02:05:15,240 --> 02:05:16,720
I mean this is all they need to do.

4476
02:05:17,060 --> 02:05:19,280
Any was cutting up with a pink pig.

4477
02:05:19,580 --> 02:05:21,830
He was practicing Jesus Christ.

4478
02:05:23,900 --> 02:05:24,760
There's like some really.

4479

It aired already.

4480
02:05:26,070 --> 02:05:26,970
First season aired.

4481
02:05:26,971 --> 02:05:27,170

4482
02:05:27,170 --> 02:05:29,070
Well the first season's
already received there.

4483
02:05:29,071 --> 02:05:29,761
There's 10 of them.

4484
02:05:29,761 --> 02:05:31,560
And there's so many channels now.

4485
02:05:31,570 --> 02:05:32,670
It's amazing.

4486
02:05:33,390 --> 02:05:36,630
But all you have to do like
a and e or like what is,

4487
02:05:36,690 --> 02:05:37,550
what is um,

4488
02:05:38,280 --> 02:05:39,270
even worse.

4489
02:05:39,330 --> 02:05:42,390
What is the fucking walking dead on AMC?

4490
02:05:42,430 --> 02:05:42,780
See,

4491

4492
02:05:44,340 --> 02:05:47,690
Who the hell ever watched AMC before
the walking dead was on madmen.

4493
02:05:47,730 --> 02:05:49,520
Madmen zone there to breaking bad too,

4494
02:05:49,521 --> 02:05:49,910

4495
02:05:49,910 --> 02:05:50,580
Yeah.

4496
02:05:50,580 --> 02:05:51,210
I mean,

4497
02:05:51,210 --> 02:05:55,200
out of nowhere where all you have to do
is just put out amazing shows and people

4498
02:05:55,201 --> 02:05:56,700
will flock to your stupid network.

4499
02:05:56,730 --> 02:05:57,660
It's crazy.

4500
02:05:57,810 --> 02:06:00,180
You can do it on Netflix or Amazon.

4501
02:06:00,270 --> 02:06:00,900
Oh yeah.

4502
02:06:00,900 --> 02:06:03,030
Netflix is a house of cards is giant.

4503
02:06:03,031 --> 02:06:05,520
I'm writing for a show on Amazon now.

4504
02:06:05,790 --> 02:06:06,330

4505
02:06:06,330 --> 02:06:07,020
Yeah.

4506
02:06:07,020 --> 02:06:07,590

02:06:14,911 --> 02:06:19,080
It's red oaks as a country club in
northern New Jersey and it's about a young

4516
02:06:19,081 --> 02:06:21,180

02:06:21,181 --> 02:06:21,751
He's getting laid.

4518
02:06:21,751 --> 02:06:24,210
It's Kinda like caddyshack
kind of a feel to it.

4519
02:06:24,280 --> 02:06:25,250
It's art,

4520
02:06:25,330 --> 02:06:27,180

4522
02:06:31,531 --> 02:06:31,981
episodes.

4523
02:06:31,981 --> 02:06:32,940
That's incredible.

4524
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:33,540
Yeah.

4525
02:06:33,540 --> 02:06:33,751
Well,

4526
02:06:33,751 --> 02:06:36,320
I know a lot of original stuff.

4527
02:06:37,110 --> 02:06:37,943
Netflix,

4528
02:06:38,030 --> 02:06:39,930
Bill Burr has his new animated show.

4529
02:06:41,790 --> 02:06:43,050
They wrote it already.

4530
02:06:43,230 --> 02:06:43,321
Well,

4531
02:06:43,321 --> 02:06:44,490
you could make something man.

4532
02:06:44,491 --> 02:06:45,324
Don't be jealous.

4533
02:06:45,330 --> 02:06:46,163
Make something.

4534
02:06:46,730 --> 02:06:47,230
They had,

4535
02:06:47,230 --> 02:06:47,680
um,

4536
02:06:47,680 --> 02:06:48,540
they had,

4537
02:06:48,660 --> 02:06:52,210
they wrote it and then it's going to
be like a year until it's on the air

4538
02:06:52,620 --> 02:06:55,380
because they have to animate the shit
out of it and it takes a long fucking

4539
02:06:55,381 --> 02:06:55,661
time.

4540
02:06:55,661 --> 02:06:56,220
Oh Man,

4541
02:06:56,220 --> 02:06:58,380
I didn't sweat shop to do it.

4542
02:06:58,470 --> 02:06:59,303
That's what happened.

4543
02:07:01,800 --> 02:07:02,633
That's what we did.

4544
02:07:02,670 --> 02:07:07,320
Me and Rob Zombie did an animated
feature called a super beasto dude.

4545
02:07:07,321 --> 02:07:08,580
You were hanging out with Rob Zombie.

4546
02:07:08,640 --> 02:07:09,150

4548
02:07:09,990 --> 02:07:10,980
He's a good guy.

4549
02:07:11,580 --> 02:07:12,330
Really good guy.

4550
02:07:12,330 --> 02:07:13,200
Hard worker.

4551
02:07:13,380 --> 02:07:16,290
Real creative works for movies now.

4552
02:07:16,350 --> 02:07:17,130
How weird is that?

4553
02:07:17,130 --> 02:07:17,880
That's good.

4554
02:07:17,880 --> 02:07:18,713
Really good.

4555
02:07:18,820 --> 02:07:19,920
That guy works,

4556
02:07:19,950 --> 02:07:21,840
gets up early and just goes,

4557
02:07:21,970 --> 02:07:23,370
really goes talking about like,

4558
02:07:23,371 --> 02:07:23,971
make something.

4559
02:07:23,971 --> 02:07:26,010
He's just like one of those guys like,

4560
02:07:26,130 --> 02:07:26,431

4561

we're doing this and
you're going to do it.

4562
02:07:28,560 --> 02:07:29,340
Wow.

4563
02:07:29,340 --> 02:07:30,240
And when we did this,

4564
02:07:30,241 --> 02:07:31,074
uh,

4565
02:07:31,410 --> 02:07:31,800
enemy,

4566
02:07:31,800 --> 02:07:36,640
it took us like five years literally from
doing it and animating and remarketing

4567
02:07:36,641 --> 02:07:36,940
and.

4568
02:07:36,940 --> 02:07:37,180
Oh,

4569
02:07:37,180 --> 02:07:37,610
I mean,

4570
02:07:37,610 --> 02:07:38,790
just went on forever.

4571
02:07:38,860 --> 02:07:41,620
Five fucking years effort.

4572
02:07:41,860 --> 02:07:43,120
How many horror movies is that?

4573
02:07:43,121 --> 02:07:44,020
Kind of direct it down?

4574
02:07:44,080 --> 02:07:44,920
Quite a few.

4575
02:07:44,950 --> 02:07:46,000
Four or five.

4576
02:07:46,060 --> 02:07:46,630
He didn't.

4577
02:07:46,630 --> 02:07:49,720
Two halloweens has 1000 corpses.

4578
02:07:50,270 --> 02:07:51,103
Um,

4579
02:07:51,460 --> 02:07:52,570

4580
02:07:52,720 --> 02:07:54,220
a devil's rejects,

4581
02:07:54,490 --> 02:07:55,930
devil's rejects was crazy.

4582
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:57,150
They just had Salem,

4583
02:07:57,230 --> 02:07:58,540
the lords of Salem's.

4584
02:07:58,550 --> 02:08:01,540
That's like some fucked up horror movies.

4585
02:08:01,541 --> 02:08:03,070
He does get dark,

4586
02:08:03,400 --> 02:08:06,250
dark and file it really flatter films.

4587
02:08:06,370 --> 02:08:07,360
And then you just like,

02:08:07,760 --> 02:08:08,250

wife and my kids and totally normal

4592
02:08:14,200 --> 02:08:16,000
directed both my standup specials.

4593
02:08:16,150 --> 02:08:16,781
Did he really?

4594
02:08:16,781 --> 02:08:17,200
Yeah.

4595
02:08:17,200 --> 02:08:19,510
Rob Zombie directed your standup specials.

4596
02:08:20,410 --> 02:08:21,610
That's pretty fucking dope.

4597
02:08:21,670 --> 02:08:21,941
Yeah,

4598
02:08:21,941 --> 02:08:22,720
it was pretty cool.

4599
02:08:22,720 --> 02:08:23,553
That's pretty dope.

4600
02:08:23,710 --> 02:08:24,970
The last one we just were like,

4601
02:08:24,971 --> 02:08:25,121
you know,

4602
02:08:25,121 --> 02:08:26,140
people have given us money.

4603
02:08:26,400 --> 02:08:26,970
Let's,

4604
02:08:26,970 --> 02:08:27,803
let's make it,

4605
02:08:28,040 --> 02:08:28,450

4606
02:08:28,450 --> 02:08:29,110
let's use it.

4607
02:08:29,110 --> 02:08:31,210
Let's make it like show
business like we made.

4608
02:08:31,250 --> 02:08:32,410
We blew the whole thing out.

4609
02:08:33,330 --> 02:08:33,720
You know,

4610
02:08:33,720 --> 02:08:35,230
stairs are really just about the jokes,

4611
02:08:35,231 --> 02:08:36,280
but we just made it like,

4612
02:08:36,520 --> 02:08:37,600
it looks like a game show.

4613
02:08:37,670 --> 02:08:38,740
It was called freaked out.

4614
02:08:39,070 --> 02:08:39,790
Oh Wow.

4615
02:08:39,790 --> 02:08:40,630
That's on Netflix.

4616
02:08:40,631 --> 02:08:40,841
Yeah.

4617
02:08:40,841 --> 02:08:42,190
And it looks like literally,

4618
02:08:42,191 --> 02:08:44,600
like it's all bright and white.

4619
02:08:44,610 --> 02:08:46,330
Mike and yeah,

4620
02:08:46,331 --> 02:08:46,810
we just made.

4621
02:08:46,810 --> 02:08:48,040
He wanted to make like films,

4622
02:08:48,041 --> 02:08:49,270
like be creative with it.

4623
02:08:49,330 --> 02:08:50,560
Netflix is amazing.

4624
02:08:50,561 --> 02:08:54,430
Now I have my first
special on Netflix in 2005.

4625
02:08:54,700 --> 02:08:55,500
Oh yeah.

4626
02:08:55,500 --> 02:08:56,650
That was my first video.

4627
02:08:56,651 --> 02:08:57,490
Special.

4628
02:08:57,610 --> 02:08:58,090
Really?

4629
02:08:58,090 --> 02:08:58,650
Well.

4630
02:08:58,650 --> 02:08:58,950
Yeah,

4631
02:08:58,950 --> 02:09:03,670
and that was the beginning of like
the whole Internet for download.

4632
02:09:03,700 --> 02:09:04,390
Nobody.

4633
02:09:04,390 --> 02:09:08,530
Nobody really had the kind of broadband
to get shit like instantaneously back

4634
02:09:08,531 --> 02:09:13,531
then it was really gratifying to dial
up and 2005 or they had really shitty

4635
02:09:13,961 --> 02:09:15,190
cable or something like that.

4636
02:09:15,940 --> 02:09:20,940
But now Netflix has something like 70
million download or somebody million

4637
02:09:20,981 --> 02:09:21,814
customers.

4638
02:09:21,820 --> 02:09:22,270
Yeah,

4639
02:09:22,270 --> 02:09:22,870
it's big.

4640
02:09:22,870 --> 02:09:23,710
So think about that.

4641
02:09:23,711 --> 02:09:26,590
70 million people's spending
seven bucks a month.

4642
02:09:28,090 --> 02:09:30,280
That's why they're making shows
because they have so much cash.

4643
02:09:30,310 --> 02:09:31,690
That's fucking insane.

4644
02:09:31,691 --> 02:09:34,060
Money in sync about that every month.

4645
02:09:34,420 --> 02:09:35,253
Yeah,

4646
02:09:35,310 --> 02:09:36,260
that's they are there.

4647
02:09:36,430 --> 02:09:37,340
They have a lot of cats.

4648
02:09:37,870 --> 02:09:38,940
Why don't we make some shifts?

4649
02:09:39,160 --> 02:09:39,791
How much can that be?

4650
02:09:39,791 --> 02:09:40,624
A million an episode.

4651
02:09:40,690 --> 02:09:41,291
Not a big deal.

4652
02:09:41,291 --> 02:09:42,880
They have to have deals though too,

4653
02:09:42,881 --> 02:09:44,890
with like a cable providers and shit.

4654
02:09:44,891 --> 02:09:46,940
Remember they were throttling down there.

4655
02:09:47,860 --> 02:09:49,460
Netflix takes on $400,

4656
02:09:49,470 --> 02:09:53,980
million dollars in new debt to fund
original content and European expansion.

4657
02:09:54,490 --> 02:09:55,600
Wow.

4658
02:09:56,590 --> 02:09:57,423
I'll make it back.

4659
02:09:57,890 --> 02:09:58,750
Oh yeah.

4660
02:10:00,070 --> 02:10:01,780
They'll make that shit back in a month.

4661
02:10:01,800 --> 02:10:05,260
I have a great idea for a
Netflix special or movie.

4662
02:10:05,261 --> 02:10:06,094
Don't say it.

4663
02:10:06,370 --> 02:10:07,510
Someone will steal that shit.

4664
02:10:08,160 --> 02:10:08,771
You can't say,

4665
02:10:08,771 --> 02:10:09,670
I have a great idea.

4666
02:10:11,330 --> 02:10:12,730
It's not like I'm ever gonna do it.

4667
02:10:12,760 --> 02:10:13,300
Why do you say,

4668
02:10:13,300 --> 02:10:13,440
well,

4669
02:10:13,440 --> 02:10:14,170
don't give it.

4670
02:10:14,170 --> 02:10:15,100
Someone else will do it.

4671
02:10:15,520 --> 02:10:20,290
Just tell us when the shut this
motherfucker down and the notes.

4672
02:10:21,260 --> 02:10:22,870
You have a lot of great ideas.

4673
02:10:22,900 --> 02:10:23,111
Dude.

4674
02:10:23,111 --> 02:10:24,100
You're just lazy.

4675
02:10:24,101 --> 02:10:24,970
This is a funny idea.

4676
02:10:24,971 --> 02:10:25,820
I'm not really going to do this,

4677
02:10:25,870 --> 02:10:28,370
but don't tell anybody man.

4678
02:10:29,120 --> 02:10:29,441
What are you?

4679
02:10:29,441 --> 02:10:30,274
Crazy?

4680
02:10:31,510 --> 02:10:31,751
Okay,

4681
02:10:31,751 --> 02:10:32,260
go ahead.

4682
02:10:32,260 --> 02:10:32,591
Okay,

4683
02:10:32,591 --> 02:10:34,430
so people have got rid of their cable.

4684
02:10:34,431 --> 02:10:34,761
Right?

4685
02:10:34,761 --> 02:10:35,750
And most people,

4686
02:10:36,200 --> 02:10:37,033
that's not true.

4687
02:10:37,150 --> 02:10:37,880
There's a lot of new.

4688
02:10:37,880 --> 02:10:40,520
Every year there's more and more people
that are getting rid of their cable.

4689
02:10:40,521 --> 02:10:41,700
A lot of my friends don't have cable.

4690
02:10:41,770 --> 02:10:43,540
I don't have a.

4691
02:10:44,580 --> 02:10:47,640
One of the biggest things though is
I'm somebody that likes to watch TV.

4692
02:10:47,641 --> 02:10:48,510
When I go to bed,

4693
02:10:48,511 --> 02:10:51,600
I like to have the TV on when
I'm sleeping with Netflix.

4694
02:10:51,601 --> 02:10:53,340
Every time watch you watch something.

4695
02:10:53,341 --> 02:10:55,610
It says like this window
pops up after the shows,

4696
02:10:55,620 --> 02:10:56,670
like are you still watching?

4697
02:10:56,671 --> 02:10:57,690
And then just turns off.

4698
02:10:57,691 --> 02:10:59,250
Then halfway through you
have to like wake up,

4699
02:10:59,490 --> 02:11:00,720
turn on the TV again,

4700
02:11:00,721 --> 02:11:01,680
or hit play.

4701
02:11:01,980 --> 02:11:05,520
I just want to make a video or a
movie that's like 12 hours long.

4702
02:11:05,521 --> 02:11:05,880
So you know,

4703
02:11:05,880 --> 02:11:08,770
for people that just want to
sleep and have their tv on

4704
02:11:09,940 --> 02:11:10,773
the good news,

4705
02:11:11,200 --> 02:11:13,390
the good news is no one's
going to steal that.

4706
02:11:15,400 --> 02:11:16,660
That's a good idea to you.

4707
02:11:17,660 --> 02:11:18,300
Have you ever.

4708
02:11:18,300 --> 02:11:20,080
Do you do watch TV when you go to bed?

4709
02:11:20,081 --> 02:11:21,300
Like do you keep the shear off?

4710
02:11:21,310 --> 02:11:24,580
I felt like a normal fucking bedroom.

4711
02:11:24,581 --> 02:11:25,840
What's wrong with you Brian?

4712
02:11:25,860 --> 02:11:26,950
But you know a lot of people that do that,

4713
02:11:26,951 --> 02:11:27,191
right?

4714
02:11:27,191 --> 02:11:29,040
You just go to Dr. Doctor.

4715
02:11:29,080 --> 02:11:29,690
Oh my God.

4716
02:11:29,690 --> 02:11:31,330
Get your brain examined.

4717
02:11:31,680 --> 02:11:32,770
The something wrong there.

4718
02:11:32,771 --> 02:11:34,210
You know there's something wrong with you.

4719
02:11:34,211 --> 02:11:36,490
She probably got a mouse
size to live alone.

4720
02:11:36,910 --> 02:11:37,630
You live alone.

4721
02:11:37,630 --> 02:11:41,080
I mean I think there's a lot of people
that watch TV with like have to have the

4722
02:11:41,081 --> 02:11:42,970
TV on when they sleep and they want a 12.

4723
02:11:43,090 --> 02:11:45,720
Our netflix show to Jello in waistband.

4724
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:47,110
Just a great idea.

4725
02:11:47,150 --> 02:11:47,501
Sleeping,

4726
02:11:47,501 --> 02:11:48,370
not watching it.

4727
02:11:48,450 --> 02:11:48,671
Well,

4728
02:11:48,671 --> 02:11:49,504
you should pitch that.

4729
02:11:49,840 --> 02:11:50,980
You should set up a meeting

4730
02:11:52,750 --> 02:11:55,960
so they have another thing on netflix
where it just goes to the next episode.

4731
02:11:56,470 --> 02:11:57,770
After awhile it's A.

4732
02:11:57,770 --> 02:11:58,870
It's has this window pops up.

4733
02:11:58,871 --> 02:11:59,141
It's like,

4734
02:11:59,141 --> 02:12:01,570
are you still watching because
it doesn't want you to do that.

4735
02:12:01,930 --> 02:12:03,130
He doesn't want you to waste with.

4736
02:12:03,320 --> 02:12:08,320
So maybe have a really small low rez
video that's just like a normal movie

4737
02:12:08,830 --> 02:12:13,780
soundtrack and know they're not going
to do that to watch while you're falling

4738
02:12:13,781 --> 02:12:16,600
asleep and then the watcher while they're
halfway awake and it's you and your

4739
02:12:16,601 --> 02:12:17,940
underwear playing with your feet.

4740
02:12:17,950 --> 02:12:19,450
And boy this like,

4741
02:12:19,930 --> 02:12:20,830
shut this off.

4742
02:12:20,860 --> 02:12:23,120
It's the biggest hit for
people who are asleep.

4743
02:12:23,190 --> 02:12:24,023
No one.

4744
02:12:24,110 --> 02:12:24,910
No Man.

4745
02:12:24,910 --> 02:12:25,361
I'm telling you.

4746
02:12:25,361 --> 02:12:26,800
No one thinks that's a good idea.

4747
02:12:26,801 --> 02:12:27,634
What

4748
02:12:28,600 --> 02:12:29,200
I was going to say.

4749
02:12:29,200 --> 02:12:32,140
No one I'll show you guys
know what it will be.

4750
02:12:32,141 --> 02:12:34,330
The number one watched
the movie on Netflix.

4751
02:12:34,331 --> 02:12:35,480
Just for people that want to go.

4752
02:12:36,550 --> 02:12:39,850
It will be the number one wash for idiots.

4753
02:12:39,970 --> 02:12:41,200
People with head wounds,

4754
02:12:42,060 --> 02:12:44,780
people missing people.

4755
02:12:46,050 --> 02:12:46,600
Seriously,

4756
02:12:46,600 --> 02:12:48,280
traditional deficiencies,

4757
02:12:48,281 --> 02:12:49,510
the can't see straight.

4758
02:12:49,980 --> 02:12:51,460
They don't know how to work a remote,

4759
02:12:51,860 --> 02:12:53,170
can't find their glasses.

4760
02:12:53,200 --> 02:12:55,000
It streams and more eggs
all around the country.

4761
02:12:56,110 --> 02:12:57,100
That idea sucks,

4762
02:12:57,101 --> 02:12:57,934
bro.

4763
02:12:58,120 --> 02:12:58,241
Hey,

4764
02:12:58,241 --> 02:12:59,440
we have to plug our ears show.

4765
02:12:59,550 --> 02:12:59,821
Yes,

4766
02:12:59,821 --> 02:13:00,071
yes,

4767
02:13:00,071 --> 02:13:00,850
yes.

4768
02:13:00,850 --> 02:13:01,810
This is not happening.

4769
02:13:01,811 --> 02:13:03,550
It's on Thursday nights at 1230.

4770
02:13:03,730 --> 02:13:05,050
And you are on this Thursday.

4771
02:13:05,290 --> 02:13:06,010
I don't know.

4772
02:13:06,010 --> 02:13:06,251
Yeah,

4773
02:13:06,251 --> 02:13:06,770
maybe.

4774
02:13:06,770 --> 02:13:07,600
I think so.

4775
02:13:07,600 --> 02:13:08,381
We're here this week.

4776
02:13:08,381 --> 02:13:09,850
I believe you're on this Thursday.

4777
02:13:09,851 --> 02:13:10,480
Is that correct?

4778
02:13:10,480 --> 02:13:11,080
If not,

4779
02:13:11,080 --> 02:13:12,300
I'm on one of the Thursdays.

4780
02:13:12,350 --> 02:13:12,731
Is Better.

4781
02:13:12,731 --> 02:13:13,391
Keep watching.

4782
02:13:13,391 --> 02:13:14,141
What did you talk about?

4783
02:13:14,141 --> 02:13:16,300
Can you give us a preview
without giving away the story?

4784
02:13:16,660 --> 02:13:17,620
Um,

4785
02:13:17,920 --> 02:13:18,490
yeah,

4786
02:13:18,490 --> 02:13:19,420
it was episode about.

4787
02:13:19,840 --> 02:13:20,470
I Dunno,

4788
02:13:20,470 --> 02:13:21,190
there's a theme.

4789
02:13:21,190 --> 02:13:22,023
I don't know.

4790
02:13:22,110 --> 02:13:22,780
I don't know.

4791
02:13:22,780 --> 02:13:25,240
I know my story though was about,

4792
02:13:25,241 --> 02:13:26,074
um,

4793
02:13:26,200 --> 02:13:27,430
when I was in high school,

4794
02:13:27,431 --> 02:13:27,911
how I would,

4795
02:13:27,911 --> 02:13:28,744
uh,

4796
02:13:28,870 --> 02:13:31,950
I would sneak out of my house
to go to my girlfriend's house.

4797
02:13:31,951 --> 02:13:32,040
I

4798
02:13:32,040 --> 02:13:35,880
would come in for curfew
and then sneak out and uh,

4799
02:13:36,460 --> 02:13:39,720
I had this whole system and I would
sneak out and they get pushed my car into

4800
02:13:39,721 --> 02:13:40,171
the woods.

4801
02:13:40,171 --> 02:13:41,004
And then yeah,

4802
02:13:41,250 --> 02:13:44,460
put your car into the woods and then
start out and then Hyde Park it in the

4803
02:13:44,461 --> 02:13:46,080
woods by her house.

4804
02:13:46,290 --> 02:13:47,270
Oh,

4805
02:13:47,470 --> 02:13:52,470
they live it out to her house and then
push it into the woods so nobody could

4806
02:13:53,281 --> 02:13:55,770
hear it and not in the woods
and hide in the bushes.

4807
02:13:56,670 --> 02:14:00,440
It was all about saying goodnight to my
family and then going on and get going

4808
02:14:00,450 --> 02:14:00,810
out.

4809
02:14:00,810 --> 02:14:01,643
Yeah,

4810
02:14:01,650 --> 02:14:02,130
do do,

4811
02:14:02,130 --> 02:14:02,790
do.

4812
02:14:02,790 --> 02:14:03,290
It's A.

4813
02:14:03,290 --> 02:14:05,750
It's a funnier story than the preview.

4814
02:14:06,050 --> 02:14:07,470
But Ari has a great show.

4815
02:14:07,570 --> 02:14:11,820
It was the point in time after at
midnight already was on Conan last night.

4816
02:14:11,821 --> 02:14:12,654
Killed it.

4817
02:14:13,290 --> 02:14:13,880
Killed it.

4818
02:14:13,880 --> 02:14:14,970
It's just stand up.

4819
02:14:15,180 --> 02:14:15,341
Yeah.

4820
02:14:15,341 --> 02:14:18,360
Nobody gives a shit about Conan on
CBS store or tvs or whatever the fuck.

4821
02:14:18,690 --> 02:14:21,030
But it's such a good
place to go do stand up.

4822
02:14:21,570 --> 02:14:22,650
The audiences are great.

4823
02:14:22,830 --> 02:14:23,940
They do a good show.

4824
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:24,840
It's just weird.

4825
02:14:24,841 --> 02:14:26,670
It's just because no one's watching.

4826
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:28,110
It's just right.

4827
02:14:28,190 --> 02:14:29,560
What are the numbers like?

4828
02:14:29,640 --> 02:14:31,110
It's better than George Lopez.

4829
02:14:31,111 --> 02:14:32,250
Like $800,000.

4830
02:14:32,251 --> 02:14:34,620
Judge Lopez show was on after it.

4831
02:14:34,621 --> 02:14:35,020
Right?

4832
02:14:35,020 --> 02:14:36,280
It doesn't do that.

4833
02:14:36,940 --> 02:14:38,880
Conan first and George Lopez accurately.

4834
02:14:39,940 --> 02:14:40,830
It's below a million.

4835
02:14:41,460 --> 02:14:41,701
Yeah,

4836
02:14:41,701 --> 02:14:43,870
they tried to do that thing that,

4837
02:14:44,060 --> 02:14:44,390
that,

4838
02:14:44,390 --> 02:14:44,940
you know,

4839
02:14:44,940 --> 02:14:46,350
late night thing on tbs,

4840
02:14:46,351 --> 02:14:47,101
they try to do it,

4841
02:14:47,101 --> 02:14:48,840
but it's like people are addicted to that.

4842
02:14:48,900 --> 02:14:49,800
NBC,

4843
02:14:49,801 --> 02:14:50,940
CBS,

4844
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:52,500
sort of back and forth.

4845
02:14:52,650 --> 02:14:55,560
Do you know what tbs is on your tv?

4846
02:14:55,680 --> 02:14:56,250
I don't even,

4847
02:14:56,250 --> 02:14:56,770
I don't either.

4848
02:14:56,770 --> 02:14:57,600
Never see it.

4849
02:14:57,600 --> 02:14:58,740
I could not tell you what the number.

4850
02:14:58,741 --> 02:15:00,630
It's like Sitcom reruns.

4851
02:15:00,660 --> 02:15:02,520
I mean that's what I
think of when I think tbs.

4852
02:15:02,521 --> 02:15:03,190
I think it's be,

4853
02:15:03,190 --> 02:15:06,550
I guess they have their
own shows to cooperstown.

4854
02:15:07,270 --> 02:15:08,103
Cooperstown.

4855
02:15:08,600 --> 02:15:08,970
Yeah.

4856
02:15:08,970 --> 02:15:10,380
But that was an ABC show.

4857
02:15:10,510 --> 02:15:12,210
It was cougar town was,

4858
02:15:12,640 --> 02:15:13,330
um,

4859
02:15:13,330 --> 02:15:13,500
you.

4860
02:15:13,500 --> 02:15:17,850
The problem is like whenever
I like baseball and whenever
there's the playoffs I

4861
02:15:17,851 --> 02:15:18,301
was going,

4862
02:15:18,301 --> 02:15:19,134
tbs,

4863
02:15:19,720 --> 02:15:20,553
I

4864
02:15:21,670 --> 02:15:22,710
gotta look it up and find it.

4865
02:15:22,711 --> 02:15:23,910
And you're not doing that every night.

4866
02:15:23,911 --> 02:15:26,730
Just there's so many channels now.

4867
02:15:26,790 --> 02:15:27,541
It's amazing.

4868
02:15:27,541 --> 02:15:30,740
And with things like Netflix
essentially with Netflix is,

4869
02:15:30,741 --> 02:15:31,290
is uh,

4870
02:15:31,290 --> 02:15:36,290
is like a production company that's
like a bridge to the Internet and the

4871
02:15:36,631 --> 02:15:38,010
Internet is where it's at.

4872
02:15:38,160 --> 02:15:40,200
It's like that is the
future for all this stuff.

4873
02:15:40,230 --> 02:15:40,650
Yeah,

4874
02:15:40,650 --> 02:15:41,170
all of it.

4875
02:15:41,170 --> 02:15:41,520
Yeah.

4876
02:15:41,520 --> 02:15:42,840
Probably with Netflix is though.

4877
02:15:42,990 --> 02:15:43,950
This is a problem,

4878
02:15:44,190 --> 02:15:46,590
you can't download it and
keep it on your computer.

4879
02:15:46,850 --> 02:15:49,980
Like you can't watch a
netflix movie a on a plane.

4880
02:15:50,540 --> 02:15:51,373
That's stupid.

4881
02:15:51,390 --> 02:15:52,223
That is a bummer.

4882
02:15:52,380 --> 02:15:55,100
Because they don't want you
stealing and then take a pirate.

4883
02:15:55,170 --> 02:15:56,430
A stream it.

4884
02:15:56,490 --> 02:16:01,490
Why not do it like on when you rent a
movie on itunes like you get once you play

4885
02:16:02,820 --> 02:16:04,800
it terminates in 24 hours.

4886
02:16:05,160 --> 02:16:05,881
Why did they do that?

4887
02:16:05,881 --> 02:16:06,714
Netflix?

4888
02:16:06,750 --> 02:16:07,710
Well they should,

4889
02:16:07,740 --> 02:16:10,740
but I think and when you
download something on Itunes,

4890
02:16:10,741 --> 02:16:13,980
you don't have a physical copy
that you could copy and play.

4891
02:16:13,981 --> 02:16:15,810
Like it only appears in the APP.

4892
02:16:15,980 --> 02:16:16,620
Right?

4893
02:16:16,620 --> 02:16:18,240
It's not like in a file somewhere.

4894
02:16:18,241 --> 02:16:19,110
We could find it.

4895
02:16:19,150 --> 02:16:21,210
Now it comes up on your ipad.

4896
02:16:22,130 --> 02:16:23,670
Your that Netflix.

4897
02:16:23,671 --> 02:16:23,911
Yeah.

4898
02:16:23,911 --> 02:16:26,640
They should do that because that's
annoying that you can't get something in

4899
02:16:26,650 --> 02:16:27,510
watching a plane.

4900
02:16:27,511 --> 02:16:28,460
I think that's whack.

4901
02:16:28,760 --> 02:16:29,300
Whack.

4902
02:16:29,300 --> 02:16:29,980
And it's when you go back

4903
02:16:29,980 --> 02:16:30,813
into piracy,

4904
02:16:31,210 --> 02:16:32,043
Dave,

4905
02:16:33,160 --> 02:16:33,993
Brian,

4906
02:16:34,400 --> 02:16:35,830
they're going to arrest people.

4907
02:16:36,440 --> 02:16:38,890
They put those pirate bay
guys and they just fucking.

4908
02:16:38,920 --> 02:16:40,090
There's some new ruling.

4909
02:16:40,091 --> 02:16:41,830
Got passed on the Pirate Bay guys.

4910
02:16:41,831 --> 02:16:42,664
They're fucked.

4911
02:16:43,270 --> 02:16:43,720
Oh yeah.

4912
02:16:43,720 --> 02:16:44,150
Yeah.

4913
02:16:44,150 --> 02:16:46,660
They just actually
rereleased pirate bay today,

4914
02:16:46,661 --> 02:16:47,380
I believe.

4915
02:16:47,380 --> 02:16:48,640
I don't know what pirate bay is,

4916
02:16:48,700 --> 02:16:49,690
a new version of pirate bay.

4917
02:16:49,750 --> 02:16:54,750
Pirate Bay is a site that allows you to
find an access bit torrent files pretty

4918
02:16:55,841 --> 02:16:56,420
easily.

4919
02:16:56,420 --> 02:16:59,580
So like if Tom Papa is selling his,

4920
02:16:59,590 --> 02:16:59,950
uh,

4921
02:16:59,950 --> 02:17:01,690
his special online,

4922
02:17:01,691 --> 02:17:04,060
like if you do the Louis ck $5 thing,

4923
02:17:04,420 --> 02:17:06,610
they would just bit torrent the
shit out of it and people just,

4924
02:17:06,810 --> 02:17:07,120
you know,

4925
02:17:07,120 --> 02:17:08,590
somebody would buy it for five bucks,

4926
02:17:08,860 --> 02:17:10,090
throw it up on bit torrent.

4927
02:17:10,091 --> 02:17:11,830
And then a bunch of people
download it for free.

4928
02:17:12,190 --> 02:17:13,210
Like movies.

4929
02:17:13,310 --> 02:17:14,141
A lot of movies,

4930
02:17:14,141 --> 02:17:15,220
like the Sony Hack,

4931
02:17:15,550 --> 02:17:18,160
they released a lot of movies,

4932
02:17:18,610 --> 02:17:20,230
some movies that aren't even done yet.

4933
02:17:20,410 --> 02:17:23,500
She got files and just
fucking throw my line.

4934
02:17:23,740 --> 02:17:24,573
Oh man,

4935
02:17:24,820 --> 02:17:25,480
that's awful.

4936
02:17:25,480 --> 02:17:28,240
I use it for illegal books and pdfs.

4937
02:17:28,560 --> 02:17:30,160
I mean there's legal
reasons for pirate bay.

4938
02:17:30,161 --> 02:17:30,760
Austin.

4939
02:17:30,760 --> 02:17:31,211
Yeah.

4940
02:17:31,211 --> 02:17:31,450
No,

4941
02:17:31,450 --> 02:17:33,430
you could definitely get
some stuff that's illegal.

4942
02:17:33,460 --> 02:17:35,410
Like if you wanted to share things,

4943
02:17:35,411 --> 02:17:38,620
like say if you had a book and you decided
you were going to release it for free

4944
02:17:38,621 --> 02:17:40,240
as a pdf with a lot of people do,

4945
02:17:40,570 --> 02:17:44,500
you could just upload it and then
people can get it anytime they want.

4946
02:17:44,740 --> 02:17:49,120
And that's like one of the arguments
about what file sharing actually is.

4947
02:17:49,840 --> 02:17:52,930
Everyone says it's just
piracy and guys like,

4948
02:17:53,820 --> 02:17:54,653
you know,

4949
02:17:54,740 --> 02:17:55,720
Kim Dot com,

4950
02:17:55,721 --> 02:17:57,640
that dude from he lives in New Zealand.

4951
02:17:57,641 --> 02:17:58,331
I mean that they,

4952
02:17:58,331 --> 02:17:58,750
they've,

4953
02:17:58,750 --> 02:18:00,400
they are fucking that guy hard.

4954
02:18:00,401 --> 02:18:01,720
They took all of his money.

4955
02:18:01,721 --> 02:18:02,860
He's going bankrupt.

4956
02:18:03,420 --> 02:18:04,240
They mean it's,

4957
02:18:04,240 --> 02:18:05,170
it's incredible.

4958
02:18:05,171 --> 02:18:09,790
And it's because He created a mega upload
and mega upload was a place where a

4959
02:18:09,791 --> 02:18:11,740
lot of people downloaded,

4960
02:18:11,790 --> 02:18:12,070
you know,

4961
02:18:12,070 --> 02:18:15,070
quote unquote stolen or illegal files.

4962
02:18:15,950 --> 02:18:16,840
Was it stolen?

4963
02:18:17,710 --> 02:18:18,543
I don't know.

4964
02:18:18,820 --> 02:18:21,070
Why do you want your big show
and read by all these criminals?

4965
02:18:21,100 --> 02:18:21,550
What do you shot?

4966
02:18:21,550 --> 02:18:22,070
So alert.

4967
02:18:22,070 --> 02:18:24,490
Stay away from the Pirate Bay
website is we've gotten reports.

4968
02:18:24,491 --> 02:18:28,870
It has been seized indirectly
by the FBI and his logging Ip.

4969
02:18:30,220 --> 02:18:31,040
Mr White,

4970
02:18:31,040 --> 02:18:34,340
I legally use it only for
pdfs and you're going to.

4971
02:18:34,380 --> 02:18:36,520
Pirate Bay is an FBI honeypot,

4972
02:18:36,890 --> 02:18:39,610
a disconcertingly plausible
conspiracy theory.

4973
02:18:40,210 --> 02:18:40,451
Yeah,

4974
02:18:40,451 --> 02:18:44,490
that's totally plausible and it's
from motherboard.com of taken me back.

4975
02:18:44,500 --> 02:18:46,030
Motherboard.vice.com.

4976
02:18:46,070 --> 02:18:49,150
Rather back to the big
house with you honey.

4977
02:18:49,360 --> 02:18:50,021
Honey Hole.

4978
02:18:50,021 --> 02:18:51,600
And you and you.

4979
02:18:52,630 --> 02:18:52,991
Listen,

4980
02:18:52,991 --> 02:18:54,790
I gotta I gotta get the fuck out of here.

4981
02:18:54,791 --> 02:18:56,380
So let's wrap this bitch up tight.

4982
02:18:56,410 --> 02:18:57,070
This was great.

4983
02:18:57,070 --> 02:18:57,371
Tom.

There's no papa.

4992

It's like dad's italian.

4993
02:19:06,250 --> 02:19:06,930
It's not,

4994
02:19:06,930 --> 02:19:07,763
it's not.

4995
02:19:08,110 --> 02:19:08,291
Oh,

02:19:08,291 --> 02:19:09,910
it would be two PeAs if it was greek.

4997
02:19:09,910 --> 02:19:10,110

5001
02:19:11,420 --> 02:19:11,660

5002
02:19:11,660 --> 02:19:11,870
