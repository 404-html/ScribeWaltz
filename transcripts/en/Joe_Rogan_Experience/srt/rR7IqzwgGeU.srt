1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,320
We're live.
All Right Jeff,

2
00:00:01,321 --> 00:00:03,210
thank you very much man.
Appreciate you coming on here.

3
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:08,660
It was very cool talking to you in 
Brazil and even though it was a very 

4
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,751
short conversation,
I learned a lot and I got very fired up 

5
00:00:11,751 --> 00:00:11,751
about this podcast.
Awesome,

6
00:00:11,751 --> 00:00:12,420
man.
Great to be here.

7
00:00:12,421 --> 00:00:13,560
Thanks for having me.
Well,

8
00:00:13,561 --> 00:00:18,561
thank you.
And thank you for all the stuff you've 

9
00:00:18,561 --> 00:00:20,511
done it for folks who don't know,
you're the guy who essentially took down

10
00:00:20,551 --> 00:00:24,930
Lance Armstrong or at least made the 
case or solidify.

11
00:00:24,931 --> 00:00:26,160
I mean,
how would you describe it?

12
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:31,700
Yeah,
I mean I was involved in the 

13
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:31,700
investigation.
Um,

14
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,960
you know,
it was a case run by the Department of 

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:34,960
Justice out of Los Angeles.
I was one of the case agents on it,

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,711
so I was associated with it.
That's one of the things that's creepy 

17
00:00:39,711 --> 00:00:40,920
about it is that the government was 
going after bike riders.

18
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,480
It's like,
wouldn't you think that they've got some

19
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:47,510
really important shit to do?
Like I think that bothered a lot of 

20
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:50,031
people about the baseball thing with 
barry bonds and with mark mcgwire and 

21
00:00:50,031 --> 00:00:51,630
all that Sammy Sosa stuff.
It's like,

22
00:00:51,631 --> 00:00:53,790
why is that the fucking congress 
involved?

23
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:55,590
And it seems.
Yeah.

24
00:00:55,591 --> 00:00:56,400
You know,
uh,

25
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,200
you know,
on one hand these were laws that,

26
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,360
you know,
the agencies I was with was,

27
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,220
we're tasked to investigate,
uh,

28
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,290
on the other hand in terms of 
importance,

29
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:05,480
um,
you know,

30
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:10,510
I was on a personal level.
I looked at the message that was being 

31
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,810
sent to youth not only this country but 
of the world and that it,

32
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:18,030
it became a fact that in the mid to late
nineties,

33
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:23,690
steroid use was so pervasive in sports 
that kids are smart these days.

34
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:28,110
You on the Internet,
they know what's going on,

35
00:01:28,111 --> 00:01:32,010
that it really did see it trickling down
to kids,

36
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,120
you know,
in high school.

37
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,420
And at some point if you wanted to take 
that sport far enough,

38
00:01:36,421 --> 00:01:38,400
you ultimately had to make that 
decision,

39
00:01:38,401 --> 00:01:39,600
hey,
do I want to keep going?

40
00:01:39,601 --> 00:01:44,601
And if I do,
I'm gonna have to make a decision 

41
00:01:44,601 --> 00:01:44,601
whether or not,
you know,

42
00:01:44,601 --> 00:01:44,601
I'm going to use these things.
So,

43
00:01:44,601 --> 00:01:45,990
um,
I think,

44
00:01:45,991 --> 00:01:46,430
you know,
the,

45
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:51,620
I think about the number of 
conversations that probably happened 

46
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,580
around dinner table between parents and 
kids because of these cases,

47
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,820
got to be in the hundreds of thousands 
if not millions.

48
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:00,070
And that alone right there,
you know,

49
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:05,190
I think would justify the resources that
were spent defendants in those cases 

50
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:10,011
always.
I was always overblown in terms of the 

51
00:02:10,011 --> 00:02:13,971
research,
the resources that the government did 

52
00:02:13,971 --> 00:02:13,971
spend doing it,
you know,

53
00:02:13,971 --> 00:02:17,040
you heard often the barry bonds case was
50 slash $55,000,000

54
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:18,450
case.
It really wasn't,

55
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,040
um,
you know,

56
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:24,720
in that case involved not steroid use 
but lying in front of a grand jury.

57
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:29,670
So it transcended spare steroid use.
It was about lying and telling the truth

58
00:02:29,671 --> 00:02:34,671
and misusing the justice system.
I've had agents all across the country 

59
00:02:34,671 --> 00:02:36,600
on non-steroid related cases come up to 
me and say,

60
00:02:36,601 --> 00:02:37,260
hey,
thanks,

61
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,330
thanks for that case,
because we can use as a,

62
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:44,420
as an example when we go out and 
interview witnesses or witnesses come 

63
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,420
before a grand jury that,
look,

64
00:02:45,421 --> 00:02:48,600
you need to tell the truth and if you 
don't look what can happen.

65
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,640
You know,
the government went after barry bonds or

66
00:02:50,641 --> 00:02:55,641
shouldn't,
they will go after you and when that 

67
00:02:55,641 --> 00:02:58,371
truth starts being told like that,
the are legal justice system starts 

68
00:02:58,371 --> 00:02:58,980
working.
When it doesn't,

69
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:00,040
it breaks down.

70
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:03,100
So it wasn't $55,000,000.
How much was actually spent around,

71
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:04,060
you know,
it's funny.

72
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:06,770
A 49,
40 9:50,

73
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,230
no,
not even close.

74
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,700
Some media outlet,
uh,

75
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:15,710
did a freedom of information request 
with the US Attorney's office in San 

76
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:18,220
Francisco who prosecuted the case.
So this was after the case was done.

77
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:22,150
So they put the dollar figures together 
with the trial costs and not,

78
00:03:22,151 --> 00:03:23,350
not,
not necessarily,

79
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:24,730
you know,
the entire investigation.

80
00:03:24,731 --> 00:03:28,120
But the trial itself,
I think it was less than $100,000.

81
00:03:28,121 --> 00:03:33,121
And the comment was,
Jesus is the most cost efficient high 

82
00:03:33,121 --> 00:03:35,350
profile trial that's probably ever 
happened.

83
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,870
Um,
but that's not a full account of all the

84
00:03:37,871 --> 00:03:40,030
money that was spent trying to bring 
them down.

85
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,470
It's not that.
And again,

86
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,510
this wasn't trying to bring anybody 
down.

87
00:03:43,511 --> 00:03:46,900
This was a situation where he went 
before grand jury,

88
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,540
uh,
didn't tell the truth.

89
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,300
Uh,
his grand jury transcript,

90
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:57,330
ironically enough,
was leaked by the BALCO BALCO attorneys,

91
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,030
defense attorneys,
and so the public all of a sudden got to

92
00:04:01,031 --> 00:04:02,620
read exactly what he said in there.

93
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:08,030
Um,
it was obvious that he at least was 

94
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:08,030
obstructing,
if not outright,

95
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,740
not telling the truth.
Um,

96
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,430
and so I think the Justice Department 
was faced with,

97
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:17,730
what do we do now,
what kind of message are we sending if 

98
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:19,720
we don't prosecute this guy,
it sends a message that,

99
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,510
you know,
far transcends steroid use in sports.

100
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,370
There's thousands of witnesses every day
that appeared before grand juries.

101
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,560
So it was almost a necessity to have to 
do it.

102
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:34,640
It wasn't about steroids,
but it was about steroids because the 

103
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,170
only reason why he was there was 
questioning him about steroids.

104
00:04:35,171 --> 00:04:40,171
So it essentially was,
and it's not a lot of people feel like 

105
00:04:40,171 --> 00:04:43,141
when it comes to like organized crime,
like didn't they bust Al Capone on tax 

106
00:04:43,141 --> 00:04:46,381
evasion?
Like that's how a lot of people get 

107
00:04:46,381 --> 00:04:48,241
caught.
They get caught lying while they're in 

108
00:04:48,241 --> 00:04:48,241
the middle of committing a crime.

109
00:04:48,241 --> 00:04:48,310
But it's really about the original 
crime,

110
00:04:48,311 --> 00:04:48,970
wasn't it?
Well,

111
00:04:48,971 --> 00:04:49,480
they did.
I mean,

112
00:04:49,481 --> 00:04:51,160
that's why he was brought in there,
but you know,

113
00:04:51,161 --> 00:04:53,080
when he was brought in,
it was made very clear that,

114
00:04:53,081 --> 00:04:54,460
look,
you got to tell us,

115
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:57,790
accusing you for using steroids.
He was given immunity,

116
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,310
actually show them that long as you tell
the truth,

117
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:02,710
you're not targeting this thing,
you're just a witness.

118
00:05:02,711 --> 00:05:07,711
So tell the truth.
But he was never convicted for using 

119
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:10,891
steroids and wasn't he off the hook even
as far as the investigation goes,

120
00:05:12,941 --> 00:05:16,060
like he never did any time and it was 
even penalized.

121
00:05:16,061 --> 00:05:21,061
Like how was he penalize other than 
having to go through trials and spend a 

122
00:05:21,061 --> 00:05:21,061
lot of money?
Yeah.

123
00:05:21,061 --> 00:05:21,700
I mean ultimately,
you know,

124
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:23,950
after he was convicted in the jury 
trial,

125
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,890
the judge sentenced under house arrest.
Um,

126
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,540
but I tell you that he's got a sweet 
house.

127
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,960
It's not really that bad.
Can you can watch TV when you're in the 

128
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:33,960
house arrest?
I think you can,

129
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,390
you know,
it seems a little ridiculous.

130
00:05:34,391 --> 00:05:37,060
I like being at home,
but I'll tell you,

131
00:05:37,061 --> 00:05:42,061
even in a situation like that,
I tell people all the time and being 

132
00:05:42,061 --> 00:05:46,111
under investigation to begin with going 
through a public trial with know 

133
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,770
potentially embarrassing things about 
you.

134
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:49,510
That's rough.
I wouldn't,

135
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:54,570
I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy.
And I was standing with the ultimate 

136
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:55,690
sentence was.
But the most embarrassing thing was that

137
00:05:55,691 --> 00:05:59,030
he did what everybody knew he did,
which was take steroids to get bigger.

138
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,860
I mean that was the most embarrassing 
thing about it all right.

139
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:06,861
And it wasn't anything else.
It was like maybe there's some more 

140
00:06:06,861 --> 00:06:08,621
things.
So it was an ex girlfriends that were 

141
00:06:08,621 --> 00:06:10,280
called it went on the stand in his ass.

142
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:15,280
He got the thing that people have a 
problem with is that there's like legit 

143
00:06:16,311 --> 00:06:19,970
problems in the world and they're 
chasing people for hitting a ball with a

144
00:06:19,971 --> 00:06:21,330
stick better.
You know,

145
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,770
like baseball is boring as shit.
And the best part about baseball is when

146
00:06:24,771 --> 00:06:27,080
they hit home runs and people were 
saying,

147
00:06:27,081 --> 00:06:32,081
well these guys are doing something that
makes them hit more home runs and it 

148
00:06:32,081 --> 00:06:36,101
turns out that there's something 
involved science and chemicals and we 

149
00:06:36,101 --> 00:06:39,341
don't like it.
So we're going to come down on these 

150
00:06:39,341 --> 00:06:39,341
people and we're going to spend a lot of
taxpayers money.

151
00:06:39,341 --> 00:06:43,371
I'm going to bring these people before 
Congress and Joe Biden's going to get 

152
00:06:43,371 --> 00:06:46,001
all goofy about it.
That's how a lot of people felt about 

153
00:06:46,001 --> 00:06:46,001
it.
Well,

154
00:06:46,001 --> 00:06:49,631
I think anytime you,
you could spend resources on something 

155
00:06:49,631 --> 00:06:52,451
that's going to directly affect the 
youth of society and sending them a 

156
00:06:53,361 --> 00:06:55,730
message about what is right and what is 
wrong.

157
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,990
You know,
having grown up in a,

158
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,840
in a sporting household myself,
three daughters,

159
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:03,650
which,
you know,

160
00:07:03,651 --> 00:07:08,651
played sports growing up and I look at 
kind of what I went through and what my 

161
00:07:08,651 --> 00:07:12,701
daughters have gone through in the 
life's lessons that you learn in sports 

162
00:07:12,701 --> 00:07:15,230
that transcends sports and learn how to 
work under pressure,

163
00:07:15,231 --> 00:07:18,680
how to work as a team,
how to individually succeed.

164
00:07:18,681 --> 00:07:20,690
There's so many great lessons to be 
learned,

165
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:24,260
health aspects of being healthy and 
working out.

166
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:27,440
All the sudden you introduce into that 
equation,

167
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,180
number one,
breaking the law,

168
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:31,130
breaking the rules,
and so there's,

169
00:07:31,131 --> 00:07:33,980
you know,
the ethics to look at surrounding it.

170
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,110
And number two,
you know,

171
00:07:36,111 --> 00:07:40,700
ultimately there can be risks and health
consequences with using these things,

172
00:07:40,701 --> 00:07:42,590
especially if you're young doing that.
So,

173
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:43,790
you know,
again,

174
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:48,791
going back to the message,
I think that it's sent to our kids and 

175
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:53,561
two parents with where I think society 
was going back then with the pervasive 

176
00:07:53,561 --> 00:07:55,280
use of,
of drugs in sports.

177
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,850
I think it was a positive one that's 
going to benefit people positively.

178
00:07:58,851 --> 00:08:00,980
And I think it did.
It did have an impact.

179
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:04,400
The landscape has changed in the last 10
or 15 years.

180
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:09,401
Yeah,
I think you're definitely right about 

181
00:08:09,401 --> 00:08:09,401
that.
And that is,

182
00:08:09,401 --> 00:08:11,620
that's the most compelling aspect of it 
as far as the argument for chasing it 

183
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:14,600
down is if kids are growing up and the 
kid says,

184
00:08:14,601 --> 00:08:15,140
Hey,
I want to,

185
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:17,060
I want to be a professional baseball 
player.

186
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,980
How many people are going to tell that 
kid,

187
00:08:18,981 --> 00:08:23,981
look,
you gotta take steroids if you want to 

188
00:08:23,981 --> 00:08:23,981
get into a good college,
if you want to get it,

189
00:08:23,981 --> 00:08:24,650
you know a bunch of recruiters looking 
at you,

190
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:27,050
you got to start making some noise right
now.

191
00:08:27,051 --> 00:08:29,300
And the way to do it is this stuff right
here.

192
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:35,020
Score that stuff in there.
The amount of conversations I had with 

193
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:35,840
young athletes,
baseball players,

194
00:08:35,841 --> 00:08:40,841
definitely cyclists where they talked 
about that moment that all their life 

195
00:08:40,841 --> 00:08:41,210
growing up,
you know,

196
00:08:41,211 --> 00:08:46,211
they aspired to be a professional and 
then they got to a certain point in 

197
00:08:46,211 --> 00:08:46,211
baseball it was,
you know,

198
00:08:46,211 --> 00:08:49,640
minor league,
maybe triple a and cycling it was,

199
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:53,840
hey about to get signed onto a protein 
going over to Europe and realizing,

200
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,740
oh shit,
to go any further.

201
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,510
I'm seeing what's going on around me 
here.

202
00:08:57,511 --> 00:09:01,200
I'm going to have to make that decision.
I have had.

203
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:06,470
I can't even count the number of 
athletes I've had sitting across the 

204
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:10,131
table from me recounting those days when
those decisions were made that were 

205
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,550
bawling,
like little babies.

206
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:16,551
Talking about that.
And I think a lot of it was guilt in 

207
00:09:16,551 --> 00:09:16,920
terms of the decision that they 
ultimately did made,

208
00:09:16,921 --> 00:09:20,280
but just the pressure of,
of coming to that moment either given up

209
00:09:20,281 --> 00:09:23,310
your lifelong dream or hey kid,
if you want to go further,

210
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,730
this is what you gotta do.
And in some instances,

211
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:29,540
you know,
Kinda rebuffing that and not doing it.

212
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:30,870
Then after year realizing,
shit,

213
00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:33,570
I really do need to do this or I can't 
go any further.

214
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:35,400
How many,
many of those stories told to me,

215
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:40,640
yeah,
it is really crazy that sports like 

216
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,310
professional cycling especially.
We talked about this

217
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:46,380
when I saw you in Brazil,
that I had a buddy that was a 

218
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:49,321
professional cycler for awhile and he 
told me this was long before the Lance 

219
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:50,950
Armstrong stuff went down before he got 
caught.

220
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:53,470
He said they're all doing it.
He said,

221
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,960
you can't compete at that high level.
He said,

222
00:09:55,961 --> 00:10:00,961
not only that,
but the doctor that he talked to said 

223
00:10:00,961 --> 00:10:03,690
you could make an argument that it's 
actually more dangerous to compete in 

224
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:04,810
that sport without the drugs.
And then I said,

225
00:10:04,811 --> 00:10:09,811
well,
what kind of a fucking sport is this 

226
00:10:09,811 --> 00:10:09,811
man?
Like,

227
00:10:09,811 --> 00:10:11,971
this is crazy.
Then after you and I had this 

228
00:10:11,971 --> 00:10:15,181
conversation,
I started looking into the Tour de 

229
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:15,820
France Times.
We spoke about this briefly in Brazil,

230
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,280
that the guy who was winning the Tour de
France,

231
00:10:18,281 --> 00:10:22,420
I don't even know what his name is.
He was breaking records that were set by

232
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:26,080
guys that were on drugs and we were 
trying to figure out how the fuck that's

233
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:26,740
possible.

234
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,020
Yeah,
it's a pit suspicious

235
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:34,370
a bit.
I mean these are hyper human levels of 

236
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:38,040
performance and you know,
he's beating guys that we know where the

237
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:40,560
elite of the elite were also on 
steroids.

238
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,970
We're also on EPO.

239
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:45,310
Yeah,
the cycling,

240
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:50,311
I think we talked about this in terms of
level of sophistication versus all the 

241
00:10:50,311 --> 00:10:51,250
sports that I saw.
Her drug use was prevalent,

242
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:56,280
was by far at the top where they were 
investing in machines to bring along 

243
00:10:56,981 --> 00:11:01,981
with them as they were competing and 
traveling to to test their blood every 

244
00:11:01,981 --> 00:11:04,510
night to make sure that their levels 
were within reason.

245
00:11:04,511 --> 00:11:09,511
Wouldn't pop on a,
on a drug test or a biological passport 

246
00:11:09,511 --> 00:11:10,220
tests,
um,

247
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,790
biological passport,
if I'm not mistaken.

248
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:18,090
What that means is like say if we test 
you and we get your levels that we can 

249
00:11:18,131 --> 00:11:21,520
test you on a regular basis and you have
to stay within a consistent range.

250
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:22,720
Is that the idea?
Yeah,

251
00:11:22,721 --> 00:11:27,721
that's pretty much it.
And it's something we're using in our 

252
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:27,721
UFC program.
So you know,

253
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:29,230
the more tests you have,
the better you're able to read it,

254
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:34,360
but over a longitudinal study of your 
blood and urine markers,

255
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,350
a science and studies have shown you're 
going to have normal variances,

256
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:43,420
you know,
each human being will have a normal 

257
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,120
variants.
How does that factor in with 

258
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,520
overtraining and a lot of these athletes
are overtrained and that's a consistent 

259
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,360
aspect of mma camps as a guys are just 
really breaking themselves down,

260
00:11:52,361 --> 00:11:54,190
doing two and a days wrestling

261
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:56,520
strength and conditioning,
kickboxing.

262
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:59,650
It's just sometimes you see these guys 
testosterone levels,

263
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,470
they come in,
they're just racked and their mid camp.

264
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:04,420
Yeah,
that's definitely,

265
00:12:04,421 --> 00:12:05,410
you know,
I'm not a scientist,

266
00:12:05,411 --> 00:12:07,120
but in talking to the scientists and 
read these,

267
00:12:07,121 --> 00:12:12,121
they take that into consideration.
I think the overtraining you attend to 

268
00:12:12,121 --> 00:12:14,560
see some of those variances on the lower
side and that may be normal,

269
00:12:14,561 --> 00:12:19,561
but when they're reading these,
you know these biological passports and 

270
00:12:19,561 --> 00:12:24,181
you see some way on the lower side and 
then all of a sudden you see way one on 

271
00:12:24,181 --> 00:12:27,931
the higher side then begins to raise 
questions about what's going on.

272
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:33,181
Now a lot of times the biological 
passport will just lead to more 

273
00:12:33,181 --> 00:12:35,590
intelligent testing or targeted testing 
may not necessarily be,

274
00:12:35,591 --> 00:12:37,510
hey,
this person's definitely using,

275
00:12:37,511 --> 00:12:42,511
but based on these variances,
something may be suspiciously going on 

276
00:12:42,581 --> 00:12:44,140
here.
Let's test this,

277
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:48,370
this guy or girl,
you know more hone in on suspicions like

278
00:12:48,371 --> 00:12:48,610
that.

279
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:53,820
And really the most accurate tests or 
blood tests is that the case blood are 

280
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:54,730
the most accurate.
Correct.

281
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,010
Do you.
This is the other thing you were telling

282
00:12:57,011 --> 00:12:59,170
me about were in Brazil I thought was 
fascinating,

283
00:12:59,171 --> 00:13:04,171
was that there there,
there's a new type of testosterone that 

284
00:13:04,171 --> 00:13:05,440
they are making testosterone from Yams,
right?

285
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:10,830
Correct.
That now they're doing it through 

286
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:10,830
animals.
Yeah,

287
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:10,830
they are,
um,

288
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:10,830
so,
you know,

289
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:15,831
one of the most accurate test now to use
is called the carbon isotope ratio test 

290
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:21,060
and what that's able to do is 
differentiate between natural 

291
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:24,511
testosterone which all men and women 
have in their body and foreign 

292
00:13:24,511 --> 00:13:27,610
testosterone because there's a different
carbon atom in that testosterone because

293
00:13:27,611 --> 00:13:30,070
it's made from a plant instead of an 
animal.

294
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:31,930
Um,
there's now,

295
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:36,700
at least in research supply companies,
I don't think it's approved for use,

296
00:13:36,701 --> 00:13:41,701
but there's animal based testosterone 
floating around which has the potential 

297
00:13:41,701 --> 00:13:46,231
to possibly defeat a carbon isotope 
ratio test because it has the same 

298
00:13:46,231 --> 00:13:48,310
carbon atom as natural testosterone 
does.

299
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:53,640
Is there any hesitation and talking 
about these things because you worry 

300
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,430
that you might educate cheaters?
No,

301
00:13:54,431 --> 00:13:55,600
I don't think so.
I think,

302
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,370
you know,
I've always found that,

303
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:02,550
you know,
your credibility rises when you're 

304
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,420
forthright about what's going on and 
because on the other side of things,

305
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,490
um,
you know,

306
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,270
the sciences,
you know,

307
00:14:07,271 --> 00:14:09,850
looking at these things and always 
coming up with new tests.

308
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:11,250
I think something,
that's fact.

309
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:12,740
I just read it today.
Um,

310
00:14:12,741 --> 00:14:15,860
and we do this in our program as well,
is uh,

311
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:20,880
there was in cycling,
they will freeze samples both urine and 

312
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,691
blood and keep them for years at a time 
and cycling just recently went back and 

313
00:14:24,691 --> 00:14:29,401
retested some of the frozen urine and 
blood from a few years ago for a new 

314
00:14:30,821 --> 00:14:35,821
drug with shade,
just develop a test for and they were 

315
00:14:35,821 --> 00:14:37,060
able to catch a guy from a couple of 
years ago that had used it.

316
00:14:37,061 --> 00:14:39,490
We're going to do that in UFC as well.
So even if,

317
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,920
you know,
there's a new drug out there that,

318
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:44,050
you know,
scientists,

319
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:49,051
chemists are saying there's no test for 
potentially a couple of years down the 

320
00:14:49,051 --> 00:14:53,131
line when there is a test for it,
we'd have the ability to go back and 

321
00:14:53,131 --> 00:14:53,131
that now maybe that

322
00:14:53,131 --> 00:14:55,790
athletes no longer with the UFC are no 
longer competing at all anymore,

323
00:14:55,791 --> 00:15:00,791
but you know,
they're still reputation and legacy at 

324
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:00,791
stake.
Wow,

325
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:02,300
that's crazy.
So the UFC is going to have like a giant

326
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:06,890
meat locker filled with old blood and p 
laboratories will have that.

327
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,050
Wow,
that's a,

328
00:15:09,051 --> 00:15:10,760
that's fascinating stuff.
But doesn't that.

329
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:16,360
Well,
there's a chain of evidence issue with 

330
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,101
that isn't there?
Which just sitting around in some sort 

331
00:15:18,101 --> 00:15:18,101
of a lab somewhere.
Yeah.

332
00:15:18,101 --> 00:15:22,720
There'll be secure freezers where there 
is a chain of custody that goes along 

333
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,071
with each sample.
So outside that freezer will be guard 

334
00:15:27,071 --> 00:15:30,251
this paperwork.
No water laboratories are very secure 

335
00:15:30,251 --> 00:15:30,580
laboratories.
This.

336
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:32,660
Yeah,
I've tried to get in than before.

337
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:37,780
It's tough.
You're signing off your life to get in 

338
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:37,780
one of those things.
But um,

339
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:38,300
no.
So there's,

340
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:42,200
the chain of custody will be good going 
on indefinitely on those things.

341
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,090
So,
so far as you know,

342
00:15:44,091 --> 00:15:49,091
this hasn't been approved where people 
haven't used this animal based 

343
00:15:49,091 --> 00:15:50,060
testosterone yet.
I believe it's being used now.

344
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,310
You believe it is?
Yeah.

345
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:56,660
Um,
there's also like wasn't an Alex 

346
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:56,990
Rodriguez.
Is that who it was that was using a slow

347
00:15:56,991 --> 00:15:59,720
or quick release?
Testosterone was,

348
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:04,010
gets out of your system very quickly as 
short lifespan or short half life?

349
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:05,420
Yeah.
What was the deal with that stuff?

350
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:08,610
It's just fast acting flax clearing 
testosterone.

351
00:16:08,611 --> 00:16:09,650
And I think,
you know,

352
00:16:09,651 --> 00:16:14,651
the landscape on how drugs are used as 
changed over the last several years is 

353
00:16:14,651 --> 00:16:14,651
tests,
you know,

354
00:16:14,651 --> 00:16:18,500
got more accurate.
And so the idea is you could take this,

355
00:16:18,501 --> 00:16:20,830
I think he was taking like gummies or 
lozenges,

356
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,990
you know,
take it at night and by morning time,

357
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:29,160
you know,
the testosterone could be clear your 

358
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,211
system.
So you take it while you're sleeping to 

359
00:16:31,211 --> 00:16:31,211
help you recover.

360
00:16:31,211 --> 00:16:31,850
That's the idea behind it.
Yeah.

361
00:16:31,851 --> 00:16:34,670
I think you see more along the lines of 
it's called microdosing.

362
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:37,280
So small amounts where,
um,

363
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,060
you know,
again,

364
00:16:38,061 --> 00:16:41,600
talking more of recovery versus building
up massive muscles,

365
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:44,300
which you saw maybe in the mid to late 
nineties,

366
00:16:44,301 --> 00:16:47,450
you saw these cartoonish figures out 
least on a baseball field.

367
00:16:47,451 --> 00:16:52,451
I think now it's evolved a little bit 
more where there's less amounts using 

368
00:16:52,451 --> 00:16:55,910
more for recovery benefits.
Now a guy like Jose Conseco,

369
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:59,300
how much damage did he do when that guy 
or positive,

370
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:00,710
you know,
depending on how you're looking at it,

371
00:17:00,711 --> 00:17:04,180
when that guy came out with that book 
and explained what he did,

372
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,140
what everybody he knew did.
How,

373
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,660
how illuminating was that to guys like 
you?

374
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:14,260
Well,
I mean you talked before about 

375
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:14,260
congressional hearings.
I think his,

376
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:14,960
you know,
his book came out of the time when,

377
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:20,470
you know,
the balco case was kind of in the media 

378
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:22,331
and it probably caused those 
congressional hearings where Congress 

379
00:17:22,331 --> 00:17:23,800
called baseball to the table and bud 
see,

380
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:28,700
and you look now 10 years later and 
baseball is completely done a one 80.

381
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:31,310
They,
they lead sports in terms of,

382
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:32,720
you know,
anti-doping program,

383
00:17:32,721 --> 00:17:35,720
professional sports here.
Well before our program came along.

384
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:37,100
Um,
but,

385
00:17:37,101 --> 00:17:37,790
uh,
yeah,

386
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,250
I mean they're testing program is,
is pretty good.

387
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:42,510
And compared to 10 years ago,
do they,

388
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:45,140
do the athletes look different?
I don't follow baseball,

389
00:17:45,141 --> 00:17:47,120
but are they smaller guys now?
I think so.

390
00:17:47,121 --> 00:17:48,290
I mean,
I don't think you see,

391
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:50,210
you know,
the Mark Mcguire's

392
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:53,520
or the Jose Conseco Osers as prevalent 
as you did back then.

393
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:57,180
Definitely look at the statistics.
I mean those,

394
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,390
those don't lie.
You're not seeing 50,

395
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,310
60,
70 home runs anymore.

396
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:03,280
You know?
See,

397
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:08,620
I'm torn.
I'm torn on that because I think 

398
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:11,031
baseball socks and this.
The only cool thing about it is when a 

399
00:18:11,031 --> 00:18:14,241
guy wax a ball and sends it flying,
I totally agree with you on the message 

400
00:18:14,241 --> 00:18:18,261
that sends young people.
I think there's a difference between 

401
00:18:18,261 --> 00:18:21,531
that though and fighting and the 
difference between that and fighting 

402
00:18:21,531 --> 00:18:23,400
clearly in my eyes is that when you are 
taking something and you're fighting,

403
00:18:23,401 --> 00:18:28,401
you can do more damage to an opponent 
and you kind of force your opponent to 

404
00:18:28,401 --> 00:18:30,840
also do something if he wants to be on a
level playing field.

405
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:36,260
If we had a sport where it was just 
anything goes like the pride days now 

406
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,050
obviously we do.

407
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:43,140
A lot of it is speculation and anecdotal
evidence and and just people witness 

408
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,800
accounts from people that were there 
like in any.

409
00:18:44,801 --> 00:18:49,801
Anyway,
who's been on my podcast before and 

410
00:18:49,801 --> 00:18:51,741
talked about the pride contracts which 
openly stated we will not test you for 

411
00:18:51,741 --> 00:18:55,701
steroids.
That was in the contract and my own 

412
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:59,361
experiences with friends who went over 
there were there were telling them like 

413
00:18:59,361 --> 00:18:59,730
you should take steroids.
Like,

414
00:18:59,731 --> 00:19:01,830
uh,
I have a buddy that would normally fight

415
00:19:01,831 --> 00:19:04,020
at 170 pounds,
could even get down to 1:55.

416
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,480
They were telling them to do steroids 
and get up to one 85.

417
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:07,770
And he was like,
what?

418
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,970
Like he,
you know,

419
00:19:08,971 --> 00:19:13,971
he couldn't believe it when he came back
from Japan going do they told me to do 

420
00:19:13,971 --> 00:19:16,881
steroids.
And that was the wild west of the 

421
00:19:16,881 --> 00:19:20,691
performance enhancing era where it 
seemed like a giant percentage of the 

422
00:19:20,691 --> 00:19:20,820
people were on something.

423
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,030
The difference being that when you're on
something,

424
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:26,850
if you're on EPO and testosterone and 
human growth hormone,

425
00:19:26,851 --> 00:19:29,130
all this thing and you're inside of a 
ring or cage,

426
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:34,430
you can do more damage to your opponent.
You can possibly land strikes that you 

427
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:38,661
would not be able to land and some of 
those strikes may or may not have a 

428
00:19:38,661 --> 00:19:41,250
permanent effect on your opponent,
so in a lot of people's eyes it's a much

429
00:19:41,251 --> 00:19:45,270
more dire and serious consequence.
Then baseball,

430
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:47,040
were you just hitting a ball with a 
stick?

431
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,680
So in a lot of people's eyes and in my 
eyes,

432
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:55,160
I think it's amazing that the UFC has 
taken this chance and done what they're 

433
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,670
doing because they really didn't have to
do this.

434
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,310
What they did is bringing a guy like you
a board,

435
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:01,740
you know I,
I've talked to a lot of trainers nail.

436
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,630
They raised their eyebrows and shook 
their heads like,

437
00:20:03,631 --> 00:20:05,760
oh,
shit's going to be different now because

438
00:20:05,761 --> 00:20:07,140
they realized that this is.

439
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:12,000
This is a,
a real big commitment to try to clean up

440
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:15,000
MMA and a commitment that quite 
honestly,

441
00:20:15,001 --> 00:20:20,001
they really didn't have to do.
They could have stuck with the Nevada 

442
00:20:20,001 --> 00:20:20,460
state athletic commission protocol.
The urine tests after fights,

443
00:20:20,461 --> 00:20:25,461
the occasional blood tests,
if they wanted to do random tests on 

444
00:20:25,461 --> 00:20:28,941
people they were suspicious of,
but in a lot of people's eyes those 

445
00:20:28,941 --> 00:20:30,680
tests were more of an intelligence test 
and they wore have,

446
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:35,970
you know,
a real honest to goodness anti-doping 

447
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:35,970
effort.
Yeah,

448
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,820
I'd agree with everything you just said.
I'm,

449
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:38,970
I'm often asked,
hey,

450
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:44,710
do you think steroid use in mma or the 
UFC is way off the chart compared to 

451
00:20:44,821 --> 00:20:48,160
other sports?
And my answer is I don't know yet.

452
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,970
I mean I've seen very pervasive use in 
other sports.

453
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:55,990
I don't think it's unique to mma or UFC.
What is unique is what you just talked 

454
00:20:56,021 --> 00:21:00,460
about,
the importance of it and that this isn't

455
00:21:00,461 --> 00:21:02,830
hitting a ball over the fence with a 
stick.

456
00:21:02,831 --> 00:21:07,831
This is two human beings getting into an
octagon and trying to get the other to 

457
00:21:07,831 --> 00:21:09,700
submit by inflicting pain and hurting 
them.

458
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:12,070
And when you give someone,
you know,

459
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:17,130
an unfair and an artificially enhanced 
advantage over that other person,

460
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,860
a man in terms of it just not being 
right.

461
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,560
It's at a whole new level.
Um,

462
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,910
and yeah,
I mean Dana and Lorenzo from the minute,

463
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:33,090
you know,
I had conversations with them before 

464
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:35,580
coming over here,
jumped fully on to this and I think 

465
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:35,950
everybody realizes that,
you know,

466
00:21:35,951 --> 00:21:39,130
from a business standpoint,
especially short term this,

467
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:42,370
this could hurt the UFC,
but you know,

468
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:46,930
in terms of longterm and short term 
health and safety of their fighters,

469
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:49,090
which I'm telling you these guys are on 
board with.

470
00:21:49,091 --> 00:21:52,180
They care about their athletes.
Um,

471
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,880
I mean this speaks volumes of what 
they're doing.

472
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:56,380
It's a big turnaround

473
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:01,460
also from just a few years ago where 
testosterone replacement therapy was 

474
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,180
sanctioned by the Nevada state athletic 
commission.

475
00:22:03,181 --> 00:22:05,400
That was a big issue that you were 
getting.

476
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,320
I mean,
there's no need to mention names,

477
00:22:07,321 --> 00:22:10,290
but I know a guy who was in his twenties
who is on trt.

478
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,790
It's like,
what the fuck?

479
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:17,030
If you're on testosterone replacement 
and you're in your twenties and you're 

480
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:20,691
competing in mma,
you shouldn't be competing in mma if 

481
00:22:20,691 --> 00:22:23,330
you've got a real problem.
If you're at such a low level of 

482
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:26,241
testosterone.
I'm one of the things that when I was 

483
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,890
trying to sort it out and make sense of 
it all,

484
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:34,130
one of the things that I found most 
disturbing was my conversation with my 

485
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:37,071
friend Dr Mark Gordon,
who's a famous for his work with 

486
00:22:37,071 --> 00:22:40,371
traumatic brain injury,
a lot of soldiers that have come back 

487
00:22:40,371 --> 00:22:43,341
from getting blown up by an ids and the 
the impact that it has on the pituitary 

488
00:22:43,341 --> 00:22:48,021
gland and how a lot of these guys have 
very low testosterone because of the 

489
00:22:48,021 --> 00:22:50,490
impacts that they've taken and he's 
pretty adamant about it.

490
00:22:50,491 --> 00:22:52,620
He's like,
if you have to take testosterone because

491
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:54,390
you've been getting hit in the head too 
much,

492
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,150
that the answer is not take 
testosterone.

493
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,000
The answer is don't get hit in the head 
anymore like you.

494
00:23:00,001 --> 00:23:05,001
You shouldn't be like putting a patch on
that and then getting right back into 

495
00:23:05,001 --> 00:23:09,711
the octagon.
If you are forced to take testosterone 

496
00:23:09,711 --> 00:23:10,740
because of the head injuries,
you shouldn't be competing anymore.

497
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:12,280
Yeah,
I agree.

498
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:17,350
I really,
I can't believe how naive people were 

499
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,220
just a few years back to to allow that 
happen.

500
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,160
It's just,
it's amazing.

501
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:21,830
How did it happen?
I think just,

502
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:23,540
you know,
not being an educated,

503
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:24,500
uh,
just,

504
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,990
just not around it enough.
They didn't look into,

505
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:29,510
you know,
things as hard as they should have as my

506
00:23:29,511 --> 00:23:30,320
guest.
I don't know.

507
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:32,210
Yeah,
I don't know either.

508
00:23:32,211 --> 00:23:34,040
Um,
it was never approved by the Olympics.

509
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,750
The Olympic Committee never approved.
It did.

510
00:23:35,751 --> 00:23:40,751
They did not.
I think in the history of therapeutic 

511
00:23:40,751 --> 00:23:42,040
use exemption on the London or 
something,

512
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:44,600
there's maybe one and I think it was 
literally,

513
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:46,250
you know,
someone

514
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,420
involved,
I'm not sure,

515
00:23:47,421 --> 00:23:52,421
but say sailing that lost their 
testicles to testicular cancer and 

516
00:23:52,421 --> 00:23:54,950
almost got to that level versus someone 
who,

517
00:23:55,040 --> 00:24:00,040
you know,
urine test would show low testosterone 

518
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:03,071
on one or two occasions,
which my understanding was alleged was 

519
00:24:03,071 --> 00:24:06,611
being required for trt back in the day,
which not only that is easy to 

520
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:10,811
manipulate.
That's all they have to do is just be 

521
00:24:10,811 --> 00:24:13,091
tired.
Like literally all they have to do is 

522
00:24:13,091 --> 00:24:13,880
workout really hard to a crazy workout,
stay up all night,

523
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,670
piss on in a bottle in the morning.
And they're like,

524
00:24:16,671 --> 00:24:19,310
this poor guy got the testosterone,
have a 90 year old man.

525
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:24,700
But meanwhile they're manipulating it.
And also it's a sign of steroid abuse 

526
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:28,250
because if you have taken steroids,
you've wrecked your endocrine system and

527
00:24:28,251 --> 00:24:33,251
then you go in there and you take these 
tests and it shows that you're into 

528
00:24:33,251 --> 00:24:33,251
consistent direct and like,
wow,

529
00:24:33,251 --> 00:24:33,950
you need some steroids to fix that.

530
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:39,400
It's crazy that that was.
That was the protocol and this was a 

531
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:43,750
just a few years ago,
we were dealing with several athletes 

532
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:46,571
that were competing at the highest 
levels of MMA and they were Jews to the 

533
00:24:46,571 --> 00:24:46,571
tits.
Yeah.

534
00:24:46,571 --> 00:24:49,450
And it's a good thing we're talking 
about being in the past because that,

535
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,050
you know,
it's not happening going forward.

536
00:24:51,051 --> 00:24:53,810
Our program does have a therapeutic use 
exemption,

537
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:59,120
a possibility for athletes.
So athletes can apply for certain 

538
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:03,641
medicines that maybe our band that an 
independent group that you saw to puts 

539
00:25:03,641 --> 00:25:08,521
together a physicians and scientists 
will look at to determine if there 

540
00:25:08,521 --> 00:25:09,530
really isn't a medical need.
Like what would that be?

541
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:14,560
Testosterone replacement theory will not
be a therapy will not be one of those 

542
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,960
like adderall adderall.
So someone recently,

543
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:24,010
one of our fighters has some type of 
disease where they need medicine 

544
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:25,720
administered.
The Niv,

545
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:30,730
every month and ivy as we'll probably 
get to talking about here is a 

546
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:32,300
prohibited method under our system.

547
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,580
So they would apply for a cue saying,
look,

548
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:38,750
I'm using this ivy because I'd need this
drug for this disease I have,

549
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:39,890
so,
you know,

550
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:45,040
give me approval to use it and this 
board will look at it and determine 

551
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,850
whether or not that's needed.
This is one athlete.

552
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,790
Yeah.
And this athlete needs at once a month.

553
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:51,380
Yep.
So when you do that,

554
00:25:51,381 --> 00:25:56,030
would you test them when they're not 
doing that drug?

555
00:25:56,031 --> 00:26:01,031
Whatever they need and then make sure 
that they haven't been using an IV bag 

556
00:26:01,031 --> 00:26:01,031
then?
Yeah,

557
00:26:01,031 --> 00:26:02,390
I mean that's,
that's a difficult one to how you saw it

558
00:26:02,391 --> 00:26:03,560
is going to do it.
Uh,

559
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:08,561
I think they would go along with their 
normal testing protocol and that 

560
00:26:08,561 --> 00:26:09,350
individual and whether or not it was,
you know,

561
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:12,320
hit that individual when they were using
an ivy or not.

562
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:17,350
If evidence of an ivy usage did come up,
then they would go back and this could 

563
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:20,330
apply to any drug that is granted for 
therapeutic use exemption.

564
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:23,420
They then go back and look at that file 
for that athlete and say,

565
00:26:23,421 --> 00:26:28,421
Hey,
looks like that athletes use Nivea all 

566
00:26:28,421 --> 00:26:29,540
he was approved to use one under a 
therapeutic use exemption.

567
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:32,060
Are you at liberty to say what the drug 
is that they have to take a.

568
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,470
I don't remember what it was.
Okay.

569
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,480
Um,
now what is the,

570
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:40,690
what's the reason why they can't use an 
ivs to mask possible performance 

571
00:26:40,791 --> 00:26:43,490
enhancing drugs?
That's the primary reason.

572
00:26:43,491 --> 00:26:44,590
And I saw this,
you know,

573
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:46,560
we talked a little bit ago about cycling
community.

574
00:26:46,561 --> 00:26:48,000
I saw it,
you know,

575
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:53,120
front and center in cycling and that 
they were using ivs of sailing solution 

576
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:58,100
to manipulate their biological passport,
so to manipulate their blood level 

577
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:02,841
readings,
which were being used to determine if 

578
00:27:02,841 --> 00:27:02,841
they were blood doping.
Um,

579
00:27:02,841 --> 00:27:04,890
it could also be used to flush the 
system.

580
00:27:04,891 --> 00:27:07,350
It,
it dilutes blood in urine so that,

581
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:12,590
you know,
natural steroid steroid profiles are 

582
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:12,960
very hard to read after you've taken,
you know,

583
00:27:12,961 --> 00:27:13,950
an ivy bag.

584
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:16,270
So that's the primary reason.
Um,

585
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:19,500
I think water also prohibits them for 
some health reasons.

586
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:21,330
Um,
those are many.

587
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:22,140
I mean,
that's,

588
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:27,260
we can talk,
I'm sure we're going to talk about it 

589
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:29,151
here,
but those were on many different levels 

590
00:27:29,151 --> 00:27:29,151
of health reasons.
I think primarily,

591
00:27:29,151 --> 00:27:29,340
uh,
you know,

592
00:27:29,341 --> 00:27:31,240
when an IV is administered,
um,

593
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,380
and I've talked to too many athletes 
that have had this happen,

594
00:27:34,381 --> 00:27:36,960
especially close to a competition,
uh,

595
00:27:36,961 --> 00:27:41,961
there's a possibility of,
of blown out of vain or having clotting 

596
00:27:41,961 --> 00:27:42,300
after,
you know,

597
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:45,270
the [inaudible] taken out.
If the idea is to rehydrate,

598
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:50,550
it's much safer to do it orally.
There could be some issues with,

599
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:54,360
with ivy administration and a Dema,
so swelling,

600
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:59,420
so we're cells will not be able to get 
rid of fluid because they've got too 

601
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:00,400
much too quick.
Um,

602
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:02,750
I have heard of that.
I have heard of that being an issue with

603
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:07,470
ivy replacement and I think that was an 
issue with at least one UFC fighter.

604
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,820
I'm trying to remember the story,
but I,

605
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,530
I,
God,

606
00:28:10,531 --> 00:28:15,531
I wish I could put a name to this story,
but I know someone did have an issue 

607
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:19,600
with legal use of it back when it was 
approved where they got a Dema.

608
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:21,090
Yeah,
I,

609
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:21,750
I,
uh,

610
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:26,810
I don't know of any current fight.
I've talked to a few retired fighters 

611
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:27,270
who told me about problems that they had
with that.

612
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:30,360
I'm now,
I'm sorry to interrupt,

613
00:28:30,361 --> 00:28:35,361
but the concern that a lot of people 
have is that a lot of these guys are 

614
00:28:35,361 --> 00:28:39,591
cutting a tremendous amount of weight 
and some of them more than 20 pounds 

615
00:28:39,591 --> 00:28:44,090
that cut that the day of the weigh ins,
they weigh in looking like a skeleton 

616
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:47,811
and then 24 hours later they're supposed
to engage in the most ferocious form of 

617
00:28:47,811 --> 00:28:52,220
unarmed combat.
We know of what would these guys 

618
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,430
normally would do is rehydrate with an 
ivy.

619
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:59,480
They would go and they would have 
several bags of liquid put into their 

620
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,150
body and then they would just blow up 
like a balloon,

621
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,270
come back in 24 hours later and you'd 
see them the next day.

622
00:29:03,271 --> 00:29:04,740
They didn't even look at it,
the same person.

623
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:07,020
They look so much bigger.
I mean some guys,

624
00:29:07,021 --> 00:29:12,021
it was just freakish to see.
You would see them rehydrated and you'd 

625
00:29:12,021 --> 00:29:12,021
be like,
Whoa,

626
00:29:12,021 --> 00:29:13,410
like what?
How did this guy do this?

627
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:19,010
They can't do that anymore.
Now they have to drink the water and 

628
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:20,700
what are the issues with drinking the 
water and how hard is it going to be for

629
00:29:20,701 --> 00:29:23,340
these extreme weight cutting guys to 
rehydrate?

630
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:24,330
Yeah,
I mean,

631
00:29:24,331 --> 00:29:26,220
there there's many issues.
First off,

632
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:31,280
you know,
studies show that orally rehydrating is 

633
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:35,390
better for you if you're,
if you're mildly dehydrated.

634
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,440
But what studies are they done by 
Gatorade?

635
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:39,690
Who Does these studies?
Uh,

636
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,480
yeah,
American

637
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:47,680
meal,
now they're real American trainers 

638
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,150
association,
a Sports Medicine Journal.

639
00:29:49,151 --> 00:29:51,430
There's many of them out there.
Um,

640
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,310
there's,
there's two things that they,

641
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,700
that they show consistently.
Um,

642
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,500
well,
number one,

643
00:29:56,501 --> 00:30:00,100
it's obviously safer to put something 
through your mouth and you put it in the

644
00:30:00,101 --> 00:30:02,080
needle in your vein.
Uh,

645
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:07,230
number two,
I thought was interesting is your 

646
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:09,690
perceived rate of exertion.
So how hard do you feel you're working 

647
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:14,640
after rehydrating orally is less than if
you rehydrate Viv.

648
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:16,380
So,
you know,

649
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:17,890
the message we're trying to get out is,
look,

650
00:30:17,891 --> 00:30:21,010
if you,
if you rehydrate orally properly,

651
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:26,370
UFC fighters,
that next day you're going to feel a 

652
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:26,370
whole lot better when you're exerting 
yourself.

653
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:29,020
And multiple studies have showed that,
um,

654
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:34,590
now that's mild dehydration,
extreme dehydration,

655
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:39,410
the studies do show that ivs are 
necessary.

656
00:30:39,411 --> 00:30:43,750
You probably should go to a hospital and
get one if you're extremely dehydrated,

657
00:30:43,751 --> 00:30:46,510
that oral rehydration is not going to do
it for you.

658
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,300
And in this,
you know,

659
00:30:48,301 --> 00:30:53,301
in Wada's prohibited method policy,
there is an exception to ivs where if 

660
00:30:53,301 --> 00:30:57,940
you are administered to a hospital 
setting and given an ivy,

661
00:30:57,941 --> 00:31:02,941
it's okay.
You don't need a therapeutic use 

662
00:31:02,941 --> 00:31:04,831
exemption under our policy.
You don't need to notify Usada the 

663
00:31:04,831 --> 00:31:08,731
problem or the catch 22 there is,
I think you need to notify the 

664
00:31:08,731 --> 00:31:12,451
commission where you're fighting that 
you were administered to a hospital the 

665
00:31:12,451 --> 00:31:15,700
day before your fight and they wouldn't 
let me not going to let you fight.

666
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,950
Wow.
So what it all comes down to,

667
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:22,980
Joe,
is our guys and girls need to get 

668
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:26,761
smarter about those weight cuts and 
should not be excessively dehydrating 

669
00:31:26,761 --> 00:31:29,320
themselves the day before.
Let me tell you one more thing.

670
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:32,850
These studies are in their infancy of 
time.

671
00:31:32,851 --> 00:31:37,851
I'm talking to a lot of different 
scientists and physicians about this,

672
00:31:38,051 --> 00:31:43,051
but right now rehydration studies are 
showing that in 24 hours if you're 

673
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,970
dehydrated,
seriously,

674
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:51,360
you're likely not gonna fully rehydrate,
whether it be orally or ivy in 24 hours,

675
00:31:52,601 --> 00:31:57,601
it's probably going to take more like 48
hours and the last thing to fully 

676
00:31:58,721 --> 00:32:01,480
rehydrate is going to be the blood brain
barrier,

677
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:06,250
so that fluid around the head,
the brain that's protecting it from hard

678
00:32:06,251 --> 00:32:06,820
shots.

679
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:12,480
There's some science out there that 
shows that may take 72 hours to fully 

680
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,120
recover.
Wow.

681
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:16,290
So I mean really throw,
you know,

682
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:20,470
the ivy thing out the window.
Even with Ivy Rehydration,

683
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:25,150
you're still putting yourself in serious
danger 24 hours later if you're severely

684
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:26,470
dehydrated.
Well,

685
00:32:26,471 --> 00:32:30,650
let's talk about this because your,
your job as the VP of a.

686
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:33,180
What is it,
performance and what does the health and

687
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:38,260
health and performance.
What about zero way to stop weight 

688
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:40,010
cutting.
I mean,

689
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:45,100
look,
ideally what we should do is match 

690
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:48,161
people up that are the same size and 
have them compete against other elite 

691
00:32:48,981 --> 00:32:53,981
athletes that are the same size.
Forget about all the way cutting 

692
00:32:53,981 --> 00:32:53,981
nonsense.
Let's just.

693
00:32:53,981 --> 00:32:53,981
What do you wait?
You wait one 80.

694
00:32:53,981 --> 00:32:55,430
That's what you want.
When you're at your optimum,

695
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:57,260
you should be fighting guys that are 
also won 80.

696
00:32:57,261 --> 00:32:59,870
Let's find out who the best 180 pound 
person is.

697
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:03,290
There's a real problem in the UFC with 
weight classes there.

698
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:07,370
There's a giant jump in between them.
There's one 85 and then there's two.

699
00:33:07,371 --> 00:33:12,371
Oh,
five of you stand at 185 pound man next 

700
00:33:12,371 --> 00:33:15,491
to a 205 pound man.
You're dealing with 2016 ounce t-bones 

701
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:20,590
that's pushing that 205 pounds.
Just think about the amount of mass and 

702
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:24,671
power that you can generate with the 
amount of weight they have.

703
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,960
That extra 20 pounds.
That's significant.

704
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:30,200
The amount of more power that they could
possibly generate,

705
00:33:30,201 --> 00:33:31,490
the amount of,
you know,

706
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:35,720
just the ability to pick you up when 
they maybe couldn't if they were just 20

707
00:33:35,721 --> 00:33:38,630
pounds less.
The ability to push out of a lock,

708
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:40,520
to,
to break out of a submission,

709
00:33:40,521 --> 00:33:42,230
to,
to break out of a clench.

710
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:46,010
That's significant and when you have 
these big giant gaps,

711
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:50,150
it's encouraging people to make these 
extreme weight cuts because they want to

712
00:33:50,151 --> 00:33:51,290
be the big guy in the division.

713
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,100
I agree with you.
I agree with you with all of that.

714
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:59,460
Hopefully Viv ban and you know,
kind of those statistics I was quoting 

715
00:33:59,951 --> 00:34:02,980
earlier in those studies will have an 
effect on things and,

716
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,420
and,
and cause,

717
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:06,390
you know,
our athletes,

718
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:09,310
um,
trainers support to take a look at that.

719
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:14,640
Uh,
I can give you examples of ncaa 

720
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:17,131
wrestling in the late nineties had an 
issue with a bad issue with weight 

721
00:34:17,131 --> 00:34:19,000
cutting and last three wrestlers in one 
year,

722
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:22,090
two Saunas,
plastic suits,

723
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,590
things.
When you say last they die,

724
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:24,240
they died.
Yeah.

725
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:29,730
A NCA went to the extreme and band.
She's most weight cutting practices.

726
00:34:31,001 --> 00:34:34,300
They banned plastic suits,
Saunas,

727
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:36,730
things like that.
Um,

728
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:42,090
they adapted and became much more safer.
The Ivy ban went into effect after water

729
00:34:43,211 --> 00:34:45,010
past,
I think 2012.

730
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:49,390
And that effected severely Olympic 
boxing in Olympic wrestling.

731
00:34:49,930 --> 00:34:51,670
We're doing weight cuts,
you know,

732
00:34:51,671 --> 00:34:54,040
similar to what an amazing experience 
now.

733
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:59,130
But they,
those sports have much smaller weight 

734
00:34:59,130 --> 00:34:59,130
classes.
True.

735
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:00,940
I think they do.
I think that every 10 pounds,

736
00:35:00,941 --> 00:35:01,420
right?
Yeah.

737
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:02,710
Um,
well I mean,

738
00:35:02,711 --> 00:35:07,711
but there was,
I think initially kind of similar to 

739
00:35:07,711 --> 00:35:07,711
what we're talking about here.
A Lot,

740
00:35:07,711 --> 00:35:09,190
a lot of pushback from the athletes 
about,

741
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:10,330
you know,
this isn't fair,

742
00:35:10,331 --> 00:35:12,100
this isn't right,
this is going to be unsafe,

743
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:15,160
adapted pretty quickly and it's become a
thing of the past here.

744
00:35:15,161 --> 00:35:17,150
So I think,
you know,

745
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:19,420
in terms of what we're going and where 
we're going,

746
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:22,600
I'm constantly just trying to be a 
sponge and absorb,

747
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:24,820
you know,
studies,

748
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:26,260
science,
medicine,

749
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:30,400
pass it along to our fighters,
pass it along internally with UFC.

750
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:31,840
Um,
and,

751
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,310
you know,
let's see where it goes.

752
00:35:33,311 --> 00:35:34,480
There's,
as I said earlier,

753
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:38,340
my position and I think the position of 
leadership is always

754
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:40,320
with a health and safety of our 
fighters,

755
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:41,490
you know,
at the forefront.

756
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:43,410
Um,
so it'd be an issue that,

757
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:48,500
you know,
personally I'll definitely always be 

758
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:51,861
looking at have you had the conversation
with them whether or not there will be 

759
00:35:51,861 --> 00:35:56,211
additional weight classes.
I haven't talked about that 

760
00:35:56,211 --> 00:35:56,211
specifically,
but you know,

761
00:35:56,211 --> 00:35:59,871
have talked about what this issue of the
Ib band's gonna mean and some of the 

762
00:35:59,871 --> 00:36:02,640
statistics and stories that we're 
hearing about weight cutting,

763
00:36:02,641 --> 00:36:07,641
I'm definitely sharing that with,
with everybody that I think that's 

764
00:36:07,641 --> 00:36:10,940
hugely important,
but there has to be some sort of an 

765
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:13,611
option for these people.
And for someone who's like say Chris 

766
00:36:13,611 --> 00:36:13,611
Weidman,
Weidman's a big guy,

767
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:18,650
I mean,
he's very to the fact that he makes one 

768
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:21,111
85 is shocking enough.
I saw him when he cut weight on a short 

769
00:36:21,111 --> 00:36:23,760
notice to make one 85 for Damien Maia 
and he looked like death.

770
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:28,940
I mean he was on death's door when he 
weighed in and then the next day went 

771
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:32,331
out and won just by sheer toughness and 
will and skill and just the fact that 

772
00:36:32,331 --> 00:36:34,860
he's that Kinda guy.
But that's,

773
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:37,350
that's because he cut a lot of weight.
I mean,

774
00:36:37,351 --> 00:36:40,290
that's how he made that weight.
And then then he fought the next day and

775
00:36:40,291 --> 00:36:43,260
he was definitely depleted.
You could see in his performance.

776
00:36:43,261 --> 00:36:45,460
I mean,
he won a decision against my,

777
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:46,650
uh,
buddy look sluggish.

778
00:36:46,651 --> 00:36:49,350
And you just push through just through 
sheer toughness.

779
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:54,480
A guy like him was the champ at one 85.
If all of a sudden weight cutting starts

780
00:36:54,481 --> 00:36:56,130
getting banned.
I mean he's walking around.

781
00:36:56,300 --> 00:37:01,300
I,
I'd have to guess at least 20 pounds 

782
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:01,300
heavier than that.
At least.

783
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,100
What does a guy like that too?
He's the champion.

784
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:05,520
If he can't make the one 85 weight class
anymore.

785
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:06,630
So you just move up to two.
Oh,

786
00:37:06,631 --> 00:37:07,740
five.
Yeah,

787
00:37:07,741 --> 00:37:09,720
that's,
that's an interesting tough question.

788
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:10,890
I think,
you know,

789
00:37:10,891 --> 00:37:14,220
these,
these are the toughest guys and girls on

790
00:37:14,221 --> 00:37:18,810
the planet and just able to put 
themselves through unhuman,

791
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:24,320
uh,
pain and suffering both in the ring and 

792
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:24,480
I think through the weight cutting.
Um,

793
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:24,960
so,
you know,

794
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:27,510
I don't know the answer to that right 
now other than,

795
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:31,200
you know,
educate and share as much information.

796
00:37:31,201 --> 00:37:34,710
I'm not a big believer and throwing a 
million rules at people.

797
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:37,380
I think you take things one step at a 
time.

798
00:37:37,381 --> 00:37:39,900
Let's see.
With the [inaudible] band does,

799
00:37:39,901 --> 00:37:44,901
let's see,
kind of what the education that we're 

800
00:37:44,901 --> 00:37:45,780
providing our athletes does.
And you know,

801
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:48,900
all was reevaluated month to month,
year to year.

802
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:54,320
I just think that there should be some 
sort of an option for these guys.

803
00:37:55,560 --> 00:38:00,560
I mean the,
the idea that they have a 20 pound 

804
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:00,560
weight jumped between one 85 and two.

805
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,980
Oh five.
And then there's a big one is two.

806
00:38:01,981 --> 00:38:02,580
Oh,
five,

807
00:38:02,581 --> 00:38:05,550
two to 65.
I mean that is fucking crazy.

808
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:10,910
There's a lot of guys that are small 
heavyweights or just dehydrated light 

809
00:38:11,041 --> 00:38:14,730
heavyweights and they have to figure out
what to do about something like that.

810
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:20,000
I really think the UFC needs many more 
weight classes and they've resisted 

811
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,120
that.
They think it waters the sport down like

812
00:38:21,121 --> 00:38:26,121
it does with boxing.
But I think it creates more champions 

813
00:38:26,121 --> 00:38:29,511
and more champions creates the 
possibility of more champion versus 

814
00:38:29,511 --> 00:38:30,840
champion fights.
I just think that these,

815
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:34,080
these gaps,
if you're going to institute this no ivy

816
00:38:34,081 --> 00:38:36,760
thing and you're going to change the 
whole system of weight cutting,

817
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:38,680
it got to give these people some 
options.

818
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:40,660
Yeah,
we'll see where it goes.

819
00:38:40,661 --> 00:38:41,710
It's not,
you know,

820
00:38:41,711 --> 00:38:44,110
other than the ivs being used to defeat 
drug tests,

821
00:38:44,111 --> 00:38:46,600
which is in my past experience a new 
issue for me that,

822
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:49,180
you know,
I'm learning on a day to day basis.

823
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:49,780
So,
uh,

824
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,020
what about athletes and camp?
Are they allowed to use an Ivn camp?

825
00:38:53,021 --> 00:38:55,350
Like what if they have a particularly 
brutal day in the Hot Sun?

826
00:38:55,370 --> 00:38:58,720
They go run up hills and they come back 
and their doctor says,

827
00:38:58,721 --> 00:39:00,670
listen man,
you're really fucking dehydrated.

828
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:05,050
We would like to get an IV bag in you.
Can they call you guys up and say,

829
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:06,520
Hey,
we have an athlete that,

830
00:39:06,521 --> 00:39:08,750
uh,
he just did a two a day and didn't know,

831
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:12,700
did hill sprints and we would really 
like to get this kid in ivy again,

832
00:39:12,701 --> 00:39:15,010
in a,
in a hospital administration setting.

833
00:39:15,011 --> 00:39:17,350
They can do it.
Don't even need to notify us.

834
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:21,340
That may be an instance where they would
want to do it because then they wouldn't

835
00:39:21,341 --> 00:39:22,480
have to tell,
you know,

836
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:24,370
the commission.
Um,

837
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:29,550
if there was no fight coming up soon,
but wouldn't that be something that 

838
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:29,550
could potentially manipulate?

839
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,970
It could,
but you know,

840
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:32,180
they could manipulate.
Yeah,

841
00:39:32,181 --> 00:39:33,760
but uh,
their blood levels,

842
00:39:33,761 --> 00:39:34,930
absolutely,
but you know,

843
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,040
hey,
it's a balancing act.

844
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:39,370
If somebody is really truly that 
dehydrated and needs one,

845
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:44,790
you know,
even if it can be used to manipulate a 

846
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:47,730
blood test,
if it's for their health and safety 

847
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:47,730
because there are so severely 
dehydrated,

848
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:52,111
then you know,
the policy is made to so as not to stop 

849
00:39:52,111 --> 00:39:52,240
that.
Now,

850
00:39:52,241 --> 00:39:53,680
uh,
Andy Foster,

851
00:39:53,681 --> 00:39:55,930
who's the head of the California State 
Athletic Commission,

852
00:39:55,931 --> 00:39:58,120
has done a fantastic job here in 
California.

853
00:39:58,121 --> 00:40:03,121
I'm a big fan of this guy and he's just 
aggressively going after drug doping and

854
00:40:03,611 --> 00:40:06,160
tested a lot of people on the UFC card 
here.

855
00:40:06,161 --> 00:40:08,100
I believe he tested everyone.
Um,

856
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:11,620
and you just,
who got popped,

857
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:13,630
I think they gave him a three year 
period.

858
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:15,640
That's,
that's extreme.

859
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:17,230
I mean that,
that is sending a big,

860
00:40:17,231 --> 00:40:22,231
big message.
Do you think that that's the kind of 

861
00:40:22,231 --> 00:40:22,231
stuff that has to be done?

862
00:40:22,231 --> 00:40:25,690
Like it has to be so extreme that if you
have to have a few sacrificial lambs,

863
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:27,430
were the rest of the athletes have to 
go,

864
00:40:27,431 --> 00:40:29,110
look,
this is my fucking career.

865
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:30,700
You know,
if you want to really compete,

866
00:40:30,701 --> 00:40:32,380
this is the way you're going to have to 
do it.

867
00:40:32,381 --> 00:40:34,420
You,
you can't take any chances because we're

868
00:40:34,421 --> 00:40:39,421
not talking about nine months anymore,
which is not that bad for fighter 

869
00:40:39,421 --> 00:40:40,300
because the reality is they're not going
to fight more than once every six months

870
00:40:40,301 --> 00:40:41,140
anyway.
So they get,

871
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:43,150
you know,
at an elite level.

872
00:40:43,151 --> 00:40:47,140
It's very rare that a guy like say a 
Vito Belfort fights more than once every

873
00:40:47,141 --> 00:40:50,170
six months at the most.
You might fight three times a year.

874
00:40:50,171 --> 00:40:52,330
Right?
So the guy takes a few extra months off.

875
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:54,460
Not that big a deal.
Three years.

876
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:56,560
It's kind of the end of your career.
Yeah,

877
00:40:56,561 --> 00:40:57,700
I agree with you 100 percent.

878
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:02,700
There needs to be the deterrent effect 
upfront and that's one of the reasons I 

879
00:41:02,921 --> 00:41:07,000
think our policy is so strong.
It's our policy first time is too,

880
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:12,030
but if there's aggravating circumstances
and that would be quantified as say 

881
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:15,811
somebody was found to take a steroid and
did an ivy bag just before the test and 

882
00:41:16,091 --> 00:41:21,091
we found out about that.
That could be an aggravating 

883
00:41:21,091 --> 00:41:21,091
circumstance and possibility of four 
years,

884
00:41:21,091 --> 00:41:21,770
which,
you know,

885
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:23,790
as we get out and educate our fighters.
I,

886
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:24,640
I,
you know,

887
00:41:24,641 --> 00:41:26,740
I,
I talk about those terms and I asked who

888
00:41:26,741 --> 00:41:30,550
thinks to definitely for is a career 
ender.

889
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:33,950
Most of them heads bobbing up and down 
mean unless you're on the

890
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:36,290
absolute top of the UFC,
you know,

891
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:39,650
food chain for years,
for years as you're done long past.

892
00:41:39,651 --> 00:41:42,740
I mean if you get popped at 34,
then you come back,

893
00:41:42,741 --> 00:41:44,920
you 38,
that's crazy.

894
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:46,400
It's not going to happen.
It's just not.

895
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:47,510
I mean,
if it does happen,

896
00:41:47,511 --> 00:41:51,870
you'll be severely diminished and the 
likelihood of you being mean,

897
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,540
you're going to be off the sauce now 
too.

898
00:41:53,541 --> 00:41:55,350
Like you were probably doing something 
so your,

899
00:41:55,351 --> 00:41:57,090
your system has to recover,
you know,

900
00:41:57,091 --> 00:42:02,091
you're.
Then there's also the mental aspect for 

901
00:42:02,091 --> 00:42:04,631
a lot of these guys.
There's a lot of these fighters that 

902
00:42:04,631 --> 00:42:07,091
were fighting enhanced for most of their
career and they have this mental 

903
00:42:08,241 --> 00:42:13,241
advantage of fighting,
enhance where they know they're juiced 

904
00:42:13,241 --> 00:42:13,241
up and it gives them all this 
confidence.

905
00:42:13,241 --> 00:42:17,710
Then all of a sudden you take that away 
and they just don't seem to be the same 

906
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:17,710
guys.

907
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:17,710
Yeah.
You know,

908
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:18,650
it's really interesting on the mental 
side of things,

909
00:42:18,651 --> 00:42:19,690
and you know,
I didn't.

910
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:22,550
I learned this kind throughout my 
previous career.

911
00:42:22,551 --> 00:42:27,551
Talking to athletes is the mental effort
that it takes to use drugs when you're 

912
00:42:28,911 --> 00:42:33,911
under a good solid anti-doping system.
Many athletes say,

913
00:42:34,281 --> 00:42:39,281
hey,
despite the performance benefits I was 

914
00:42:39,281 --> 00:42:39,770
getting from these drugs,
I definitely felt stronger.

915
00:42:39,771 --> 00:42:44,270
Could go longer.
What it took to figure out what drugs to

916
00:42:44,271 --> 00:42:49,271
take,
how long they were going to clear my 

917
00:42:49,271 --> 00:42:50,891
system,
worry after I took a drug was shit or 

918
00:42:50,891 --> 00:42:50,891
the tests is going to come tomorrow 
morning.

919
00:42:50,891 --> 00:42:55,480
That mental burden for a lot of these 
athletes far outweighed the physical 

920
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,830
enhancement they were getting.
That's a good point.

921
00:42:58,010 --> 00:43:00,170
As an endless amount of stress,
could you imagine?

922
00:43:00,171 --> 00:43:01,700
I mean our,
our policy,

923
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:06,730
you're going to be tested.
The ability to be tested 365 days a 

924
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:06,730
year.

925
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:12,250
You know,
an athlete who would choose to use 

926
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:12,250
something that night,
that athlete use something.

927
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:15,740
Can you imagine like listening for that 
doorbell or that warnock all night long?

928
00:43:15,741 --> 00:43:18,230
All morning long.
There was some athletes I talked to that

929
00:43:18,231 --> 00:43:23,231
had surveillance systems up where they 
would literally at night after taking a 

930
00:43:23,231 --> 00:43:25,430
dose be looking at their television 
screens and shit's coming down.

931
00:43:25,830 --> 00:43:30,830
It's crazy now.
A huge mental tasks and they can't hide 

932
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:31,040
either.
Right.

933
00:43:31,041 --> 00:43:36,041
It's not like you could just go to palm 
beach and take a hotel room and camp 

934
00:43:36,041 --> 00:43:39,911
out.
You have to like let the UFC know where 

935
00:43:39,911 --> 00:43:39,911
you are all the time.
Yeah,

936
00:43:39,911 --> 00:43:43,451
so we have a whereabouts program and so 
that requires our athletes on a 

937
00:43:43,461 --> 00:43:47,270
quarterly basis to fill out whereabouts,
where they're going,

938
00:43:47,330 --> 00:43:49,940
where they can be located,
where they're staying overnight,

939
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:55,510
regularly scheduled activities that they
have during the day so that if you saw 

940
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:59,411
to who's administrating our program,
wants to go out and find that athlete 

941
00:43:59,411 --> 00:43:59,411
they can do that now.

942
00:43:59,411 --> 00:44:01,310
Doesn't include.
It doesn't include our involved.

943
00:44:01,311 --> 00:44:06,311
Twenty four slash seven.
Whereabouts are athletes don't need to 

944
00:44:06,311 --> 00:44:10,001
let you saw to know where they're going 
to be at all times if they're going out 

945
00:44:10,001 --> 00:44:11,240
to a movie or the supermarket or 
something like that.

946
00:44:11,330 --> 00:44:13,640
It doesn't mean that it just means if 
you saw to,

947
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:17,360
chooses on a day or night to go locate 
one of our athletes,

948
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:22,780
they have an idea of where to go find 
them and can find them within a 

949
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:26,441
reasonable amount of time.
I was having a conversation with a to 

950
00:44:26,441 --> 00:44:27,890
keep this as vague as possible.
Um,

951
00:44:27,891 --> 00:44:32,010
I was having a conversation with an 
athlete who was telling that he knew of

952
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:37,010
an athlete that was not clean.
And then so this athlete decided to go 

953
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:42,000
overseas and train,
just decided to like go hang out in some

954
00:44:42,001 --> 00:44:43,830
other country and train there for 
awhile.

955
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,900
What do you do if someone says,
you know,

956
00:44:45,901 --> 00:44:47,280
hey,
I'm going to go train and Thailand.

957
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:49,320
You guys going to go fly out to Thailand
and,

958
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:50,220
and test them.

959
00:44:50,590 --> 00:44:52,770
It's one of the reasons we hired you,
saw that you saw to,

960
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:56,400
has partnerships with international,
uh,

961
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:59,110
anti-doping agencies all across the 
world.

962
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:00,040
I mean,
that's,

963
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:02,590
that's their job.
They're constantly going to conferences,

964
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:07,591
they're going out and training 
collection officers from other 

965
00:45:07,591 --> 00:45:08,320
international bodies.
So they do,

966
00:45:08,321 --> 00:45:13,321
they have the ability to reach out 
anywhere in the world because our 

967
00:45:13,321 --> 00:45:16,711
population of athletes is spread across 
the world and get a test taken or a 

968
00:45:16,711 --> 00:45:17,340
sample taken from them at any time.

969
00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:18,120
Well,
let's,

970
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:19,820
let's just say like,
I mean,

971
00:45:19,821 --> 00:45:20,660
I'm not,
uh,

972
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:26,590
not accusing anybody of anything but 
let's just say if you were an 

973
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:31,031
unscrupulous athlete and you had ties to
maybe people who also do unscrupulous 

974
00:45:31,031 --> 00:45:34,760
things and they had a reasonable amount 
of power in a certain country,

975
00:45:35,170 --> 00:45:40,170
um,
and you could just go there and they 

976
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:40,700
kinda had deals with people and they,
uh,

977
00:45:40,701 --> 00:45:41,390
they said,
look,

978
00:45:41,391 --> 00:45:42,680
you know,
we're,

979
00:45:42,930 --> 00:45:47,930
we're going to give you a blood sample 
and we're going to give you a urine 

980
00:45:47,930 --> 00:45:50,681
sample,
but we just like you to wait here for a 

981
00:45:50,681 --> 00:45:52,661
moment and we'll just go in the other 
room and we come back with this stuff 

982
00:45:52,661 --> 00:45:52,661
and they come back and they give it to 
these guys.

983
00:45:52,661 --> 00:45:57,660
It,
are you getting like video tape of this 

984
00:45:57,660 --> 00:46:00,521
happening?
Are you making sure you're seeing the 

985
00:46:00,521 --> 00:46:01,530
exact athlete put the exact blood in the
exact thing,

986
00:46:01,531 --> 00:46:04,520
like how were you going to make sure 
that there's no fuckery,

987
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:08,030
no shenanigans going on,
especially in other countries?

988
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:09,580
Yeah.
So there's a certain standard,

989
00:46:09,581 --> 00:46:13,510
no matter which country the collection's
going onto a of how these,

990
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:17,920
how these collections happen and the 
doping collection officer,

991
00:46:17,921 --> 00:46:22,921
the,
the DCO has to physically witness the 

992
00:46:22,921 --> 00:46:24,950
athlete providing the sample.
Uh,

993
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,090
whether it be urine or blood test,
they have to.

994
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:31,370
How do you prove that they did that?
Like if you're dealing with someone like

995
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:34,010
I said in another country,
how do you prove that this,

996
00:46:34,011 --> 00:46:39,011
uh,
this commissioner guy actually was 

997
00:46:39,011 --> 00:46:39,011
there?

998
00:46:39,011 --> 00:46:39,011
Well,
I mean these,

999
00:46:39,011 --> 00:46:40,640
you know,
the Dcos are trained,

1000
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:45,740
uh,
based on worldwide collection standards 

1001
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:45,740
and um,
you know,

1002
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:48,280
they're vetted before they're hired.
I mean that,

1003
00:46:48,310 --> 00:46:53,310
that could happen anywhere Joe could 
happen in this country or another 

1004
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:53,310
country.
Um,

1005
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:53,310
but I like,
you know,

1006
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:54,470
Erika better than I like other 
countries,

1007
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,110
so like to talk shit about them.
I think part of it will be,

1008
00:46:57,111 --> 00:46:59,420
okay,
so the laboratory gets these samples,

1009
00:46:59,421 --> 00:46:59,960
you know,
we're,

1010
00:46:59,961 --> 00:47:03,620
I think we're doing 2,700
to 3000 tests a year.

1011
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:07,150
You start looking at samples,
you know,

1012
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:12,250
from a particular country,
whether it be the United States in a 

1013
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:15,011
certain region or another country,
and you start seeing suspicion in that 

1014
00:47:15,011 --> 00:47:15,460
sample.
Um,

1015
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:19,970
you start seeing Aaron variances in the 
biological passport and collections done

1016
00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:22,760
in another country versus when,
you know,

1017
00:47:22,761 --> 00:47:24,500
maybe they come here to the United 
States,

1018
00:47:24,501 --> 00:47:29,501
things like that.
So it's a constant detective game going 

1019
00:47:29,501 --> 00:47:30,100
on and there's,

1020
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:35,160
you know,
things put in place for every 

1021
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:37,800
conceivable situation to try to,
to try to detect that it's his seems 

1022
00:47:38,501 --> 00:47:39,250
like,
um,

1023
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:43,330
you're going to catch them.
It just seems like there's only so much,

1024
00:47:44,290 --> 00:47:47,200
so much wiggle room these guys have 
these days,

1025
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:52,260
but are there any things that are on 
your radar that could possibly be used 

1026
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:58,540
to cheat that we're not aware of yet 
that most people aren't aware of?

1027
00:47:58,570 --> 00:48:00,760
Like the testosterone that's being done 
with animals?

1028
00:48:00,970 --> 00:48:05,970
I never heard about that before.
Is there anything else like that that's 

1029
00:48:05,970 --> 00:48:06,250
going on right now?
That's why I can't give you any specific

1030
00:48:06,251 --> 00:48:11,251
example,
but I will give the example of cyclists 

1031
00:48:11,251 --> 00:48:13,720
that just got caught for the drugs still
in a clinical trial and what the 

1032
00:48:13,930 --> 00:48:18,930
anti-doping with that shows,
what the anti-doping community has been 

1033
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:22,591
doing is reaching out to the 
pharmaceutical industry and saying and 

1034
00:48:22,591 --> 00:48:22,930
querying,
hey,

1035
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,700
any drugs that you have,
you know,

1036
00:48:24,701 --> 00:48:29,701
in clinical trial or to being developed,
do you see any potential for athletic 

1037
00:48:29,701 --> 00:48:30,550
performance enhancing benefits?

1038
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:32,620
And if the pharmaceutical industry.
I said,

1039
00:48:32,621 --> 00:48:33,160
yeah,
you know,

1040
00:48:33,161 --> 00:48:36,040
this particular drug was,
it was called oxygen and a pill,

1041
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:41,520
so you take it and create more red blood
cells similar to hipo but in an oral 

1042
00:48:41,531 --> 00:48:46,531
form.
And so the pharmaceutical industry 

1043
00:48:46,531 --> 00:48:46,810
obviously told anti-doping,
now this is coming out.

1044
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:52,170
Anti-Doping community was able to 
develop a test kind of secretly and use 

1045
00:48:52,661 --> 00:48:55,390
the test and caught somebody's oxygen in
a pill.

1046
00:48:55,430 --> 00:48:56,260
So it was called.
Yup.

1047
00:48:56,290 --> 00:49:01,290
Wow.
So it's essentially the same thing as 

1048
00:49:01,290 --> 00:49:05,071
epo or works in a different way.
My understanding essentially the same 

1049
00:49:05,071 --> 00:49:08,221
thing.
It causes your body to produce more red 

1050
00:49:08,221 --> 00:49:10,450
blood cells which carry more oxygen and 
can replenish your muscles quicker.

1051
00:49:10,510 --> 00:49:12,760
Now here's the rub on that.
Okay.

1052
00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:15,580
Obviously that's an illegal substance 
and it should be banned,

1053
00:49:15,581 --> 00:49:17,950
but what about guys who trained at 
altitude?

1054
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:21,370
What about guys who,
who sleeping altitude tense?

1055
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:23,500
Like I remember on one of the countdown 
shows,

1056
00:49:23,501 --> 00:49:28,501
Bj Penn was sleeping in this crazy 
zip-up tent and one of the things he 

1057
00:49:28,501 --> 00:49:30,310
said,
Bj Penn's accent,

1058
00:49:30,311 --> 00:49:31,270
he goes,
you know what?

1059
00:49:31,271 --> 00:49:36,271
I'm sleeping in a plastic tent.
Someone's getting their ass kicked 

1060
00:49:36,271 --> 00:49:38,350
because yes,
the zip up this fucking tent to sleep in

1061
00:49:38,351 --> 00:49:41,560
it to simulate that he's at 10,000
feet or these sleeping there.

1062
00:49:41,810 --> 00:49:43,890
Um,
there's all sorts of other things like a

1063
00:49:43,891 --> 00:49:47,200
scent of you,
you're aware of those altitudes machines

1064
00:49:47,201 --> 00:49:49,090
that they use at very,
the altitude.

1065
00:49:49,430 --> 00:49:54,430
It's like A.
I know I'm a Ian Mccall is a big fan of 

1066
00:49:54,430 --> 00:49:54,730
those.
He said they have tremendous effects.

1067
00:49:55,090 --> 00:49:57,790
A cryogenic chambers.
I'm a huge fan of those.

1068
00:49:57,791 --> 00:50:00,130
They have massive effects on 
inflammation,

1069
00:50:00,131 --> 00:50:02,770
massive effects on the neo Pranav 
friend,

1070
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,440
a cold shock proteins,
all these different things that help you

1071
00:50:05,441 --> 00:50:08,840
heal and reduce inflammation and help 
you train more the.

1072
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:13,000
If you could do what that could do in a 
pill form,

1073
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:14,470
it might be illegal,
right?

1074
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:15,940
Yeah,
and you know,

1075
00:50:15,941 --> 00:50:16,370
I don't,
I,

1076
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:17,590
I hear the argument of,
Hey,

1077
00:50:17,591 --> 00:50:19,510
isn't that cheating getting in an oxygen
tent,

1078
00:50:19,511 --> 00:50:24,511
but I don't buy off that.
That's the same thing as taking a drug 

1079
00:50:24,511 --> 00:50:26,200
that manipulate the hormones and 
steroids in your body.

1080
00:50:26,201 --> 00:50:27,440
I think what ego,
I mean,

1081
00:50:27,470 --> 00:50:29,210
isn't it exactly the same.
I mean if you,

1082
00:50:29,211 --> 00:50:32,960
if you take gpo doesn't do exactly the 
same thing as sleeping at altitude,

1083
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:36,220
but I think it does,
but it does it in a quicker forum.

1084
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:41,260
You don't have to put forth the effort 
of sleeping in an oxygen tent every 

1085
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:43,790
night for a period of weeks or months.
It's instantaneous.

1086
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:47,990
I'm not on the side of EPO.
Don't get me wrong.

1087
00:50:47,991 --> 00:50:49,640
I don't think you should be allowed to 
take it.

1088
00:50:49,641 --> 00:50:54,641
And I think as far as I know,
the only fighter that has been popped 

1089
00:50:54,641 --> 00:50:57,311
for in the UFC was Ali bag off,
which shows you how impressive Demetrius

1090
00:50:58,640 --> 00:50:59,360
Johnson's cardio is.

1091
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:01,850
He outworked that guy who was on epo at 
the time.

1092
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:06,440
But if,
if he's taken that and that's illegal,

1093
00:51:06,441 --> 00:51:11,441
but he gets the exact same benefit as 
someone who's sleeping in an oxygen 

1094
00:51:11,441 --> 00:51:11,720
tent,
why is it more difficult?

1095
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:13,760
I just don't.
Why is that legal?

1096
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:16,090
I don't think you get the same exact 
benefit.

1097
00:51:16,170 --> 00:51:19,050
I think it's way more extreme.
Um,

1098
00:51:19,690 --> 00:51:22,300
and using the drug you can get your 
love.

1099
00:51:22,310 --> 00:51:27,310
I mean,
I've seen some hermatocrit levels of 

1100
00:51:27,310 --> 00:51:29,370
some athletes get up in the mid fifties,
60 years.

1101
00:51:29,390 --> 00:51:31,520
What's a normal number of adequate 
levels?

1102
00:51:31,521 --> 00:51:34,280
The amount of red blood cells per blood 
volume.

1103
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:38,990
Normal numbers are 42 percent,
maybe on the high end,

1104
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:42,170
47 or 48 percent.
Um,

1105
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:47,440
I've seen them again in the mid fifties 
to sixties and we start talking about 

1106
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,430
him.
Adequate levels of those amounts.

1107
00:51:49,790 --> 00:51:54,790
There's so many red blood cells per 
blood volume that your blood becomes 

1108
00:51:54,790 --> 00:51:54,790
thick.

1109
00:51:54,790 --> 00:51:59,060
Tar like,
and I think we saw this with cyclists in

1110
00:51:59,061 --> 00:52:02,360
the mid nineties that just discovered 
epo and we're using it.

1111
00:52:02,810 --> 00:52:07,810
They were dropping dead in their mid 
twenties because of having strokes 

1112
00:52:07,810 --> 00:52:10,040
because their blood became so thick that
any small little blockage,

1113
00:52:10,041 --> 00:52:12,350
the blood couldn't get through and stops
circulating.

1114
00:52:12,830 --> 00:52:17,830
You've got instances where they were 
setting their alarms in the middle of 

1115
00:52:17,830 --> 00:52:21,280
the night and to get up and drink water 
and do pushups and exercise to make sure

1116
00:52:21,451 --> 00:52:24,410
that their blood was,
was still flowing for fear of it slowing

1117
00:52:24,411 --> 00:52:26,960
down and stopped flowing in the middle 
of the night.

1118
00:52:26,961 --> 00:52:31,961
So you can extremely increase hematocrit
levels via using drugs like this versus 

1119
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:37,400
you know,
training at oxygen and oxygen tents.

1120
00:52:37,401 --> 00:52:39,790
I think maybe you can get up a little 
bit higher into that,

1121
00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:42,830
that normal range and the 47 or 48 
percent,

1122
00:52:43,370 --> 00:52:47,150
but I haven't seen extremes of getting 
into mid fifties and sixties from that.

1123
00:52:47,210 --> 00:52:52,210
Yeah.
My friend who was on the cycling team 

1124
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:52,210
said that he would hear,
they were,

1125
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:53,420
they would be on a tour,
a sleeping in a bus,

1126
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:58,600
and you would hear guys get up in the 
middle of the night and hear their bike 

1127
00:52:58,600 --> 00:52:58,640
come off the rack and they'd go riding 
because they had to.

1128
00:52:58,790 --> 00:53:03,790
Yeah,
because their heart would start beating 

1129
00:53:03,790 --> 00:53:03,790
funky and they'd be like,
Oh shit.

1130
00:53:03,790 --> 00:53:07,240
And they.
They literally are producing so much 

1131
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:07,240
blood that they had to burn some of it 
off.

1132
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:08,240
That's terrifying.
Yeah.

1133
00:53:08,241 --> 00:53:13,241
I don't know if it's burning it off.
It's just keeping it circulating 

1134
00:53:13,241 --> 00:53:16,430
internally,
but also the fact that these are the 

1135
00:53:16,430 --> 00:53:17,250
same guys who are taking this stuff.
I'm not the.

1136
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:19,400
The cyclists were obviously,
but fighters,

1137
00:53:19,401 --> 00:53:21,490
they would get hit.
You're going to get hit,

1138
00:53:21,491 --> 00:53:26,491
you're going to get a lot of bruising 
and bruising is essentially just 

1139
00:53:26,491 --> 00:53:26,491
internal bleeding.
I mean that's

1140
00:53:26,491 --> 00:53:28,980
what you're getting.
When you used to look at a guy's leg and

1141
00:53:28,981 --> 00:53:33,981
he gets leg kicked a bunch and you see 
these big welts and black and blue all 

1142
00:53:33,981 --> 00:53:34,140
over his legs.
That's blood.

1143
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:36,480
He's bleeding.
It's clotting up inside of his leg.

1144
00:53:36,481 --> 00:53:39,330
But he's bleeding and swelling when a 
guy's on epo,

1145
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:43,080
is there a more significant danger when 
when something like that's going on,

1146
00:53:43,081 --> 00:53:45,300
if you are bleeding like that or if your
a bruising?

1147
00:53:45,650 --> 00:53:46,320
Yeah,
I think so.

1148
00:53:46,321 --> 00:53:47,370
Again,
I'm not a scientist,

1149
00:53:47,371 --> 00:53:49,520
but common sense will show you if you 
had more,

1150
00:53:49,770 --> 00:53:51,960
lot more red blood cells floating around
that are,

1151
00:53:52,050 --> 00:53:53,700
that are able to clot,
then yeah,

1152
00:53:53,701 --> 00:53:58,701
you're likely running that risk.
It's just amazing what people are 

1153
00:53:58,701 --> 00:54:00,990
willing to risk just to win.
It sure is.

1154
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:03,590
It's certainly,
that's been a lesson that I'm just,

1155
00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:05,010
I'm not surprised anymore.
You know,

1156
00:54:05,011 --> 00:54:10,011
there's,
you see a lot informal questionnaires,

1157
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:15,080
interviews of athletes.
If you could give up a couple of years 

1158
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:15,080
in your life,
you know,

1159
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:18,730
and there was a pill that would allow 
you to win an Olympic gold medal that 

1160
00:54:18,730 --> 00:54:18,730
you had to give up,
you know,

1161
00:54:18,730 --> 00:54:20,100
four or five years and your life would 
you.

1162
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:23,100
And typically you see the answers to 
that overwhelmingly.

1163
00:54:23,101 --> 00:54:24,470
Yes.
Um,

1164
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:29,160
and I think a lot of it is athletes are 
a little bit younger and their mid,

1165
00:54:29,790 --> 00:54:32,010
early twenties feeling invincible at 
that time.

1166
00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:34,920
Who's thinking about five years on the 
end of your life then,

1167
00:54:34,921 --> 00:54:36,040
and I think,
you know,

1168
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:41,080
a lot of the decision making of,
of taking some of these performance 

1169
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:41,670
enhancing drugs occurs then,
um,

1170
00:54:41,671 --> 00:54:46,671
were you feel young and invincible and 
who cares what you have to pay 20 or 30 

1171
00:54:46,671 --> 00:54:48,440
years down the line,
uh,

1172
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,760
for making a decision now.
Yeah.

1173
00:54:50,761 --> 00:54:55,761
And there's also a bunch of athletes 
that are putting money in the bank of 

1174
00:54:55,761 --> 00:54:58,230
medical technology and innovation and 
they're like,

1175
00:54:58,231 --> 00:55:00,300
look,
one day they going to fix this.

1176
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:02,670
Let me just take the shit now.
And then five,

1177
00:55:02,671 --> 00:55:05,070
10 years from now,
they'll just build me a new liver.

1178
00:55:06,210 --> 00:55:07,110
Yeah,
yeah.

1179
00:55:07,111 --> 00:55:08,100
I'm a,
you know,

1180
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:13,460
one thing,
people were kind of surprised that this 

1181
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:13,460
is my opinion.
Uh,

1182
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:17,250
but I understand a lot of times why 
these decisions are made.

1183
00:55:17,251 --> 00:55:20,190
There's such temptation financially.
There's still,

1184
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:22,980
there's such incentive out there 
financially and a lot of these sports,

1185
00:55:23,430 --> 00:55:26,040
um,
there's such pressure.

1186
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:31,160
I don't know what the word is,
distrust of their competitors or 

1187
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:33,390
teammates that they all feel that,
that are using something.

1188
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:38,600
There's a lot of distrust of sports 
governing bodies that they really don't 

1189
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:41,640
feel that they care because they're 
programs aren't solid at.

1190
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:46,660
So I've had,
I've had so many of these athletes 

1191
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:46,660
really surprised that I say,
Hey,

1192
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:48,660
I understand why I made that decision.
I get it.

1193
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:49,950
As opposed to,
you know,

1194
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:52,080
well you do and you should never have 
done that.

1195
00:55:52,410 --> 00:55:54,750
So you do the good cop.
I do.

1196
00:55:54,751 --> 00:55:56,490
I mean,
I genuinely feel that.

1197
00:55:56,491 --> 00:55:58,620
I like to think that I wouldn't make 
that decision,

1198
00:55:58,621 --> 00:56:00,570
but health.
I was in my early twenties,

1199
00:56:00,571 --> 00:56:01,620
mid twenties.
I don't know.

1200
00:56:01,621 --> 00:56:04,710
I couldn't sit here and tell you that 
and if you're in the culture of,

1201
00:56:04,970 --> 00:56:09,970
you know,
you're in these camps and everyone in 

1202
00:56:09,970 --> 00:56:09,990
the camp is using you most likely would 
have a problem.

1203
00:56:09,991 --> 00:56:12,810
If you weren't where people wouldn't 
trust you or

1204
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:18,000
now they would be more likely to turn on
you or you'd have a problem with 

1205
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:20,050
training with these people.
And there's A.

1206
00:56:20,050 --> 00:56:22,720
There's this culture of comradery that 
comes with fight camps,

1207
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:24,100
especially where these

1208
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:29,100
guys have to trust each other because 
they're beating the shit out of each 

1209
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:29,920
other on a daily basis and they have to 
trust that they're hitting each other at

1210
00:56:29,921 --> 00:56:30,940
60,
70 percent,

1211
00:56:30,941 --> 00:56:35,941
not 100 percent,
and that they are trying to work and 

1212
00:56:35,941 --> 00:56:38,911
help each other.
Have you had resistance from any camps 

1213
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:39,430
in particular?
No.

1214
00:56:39,431 --> 00:56:40,390
Outwardly,
no.

1215
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:43,930
It's all been positive.
A lot of questioning on the ivy issue,

1216
00:56:44,050 --> 00:56:49,050
so maybe quantify a little bit of 
resistance there in terms of the 

1217
00:56:49,050 --> 00:56:49,630
anti-doping.
Overwhelmingly,

1218
00:56:49,870 --> 00:56:51,160
hey,
good for you guys.

1219
00:56:51,161 --> 00:56:54,640
This is great and I don't know if that's
some of that's lip service or not,

1220
00:56:55,150 --> 00:56:59,410
but I'm guessing that even those 
athletes that have chosen in the past to

1221
00:56:59,411 --> 00:57:01,810
use that,
a lot of them are like,

1222
00:57:01,870 --> 00:57:04,660
thank God I don't.
This decisions now made for me.

1223
00:57:04,661 --> 00:57:07,690
I don't have to be making this decision 
anymore.

1224
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:08,980
I'm now.

1225
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:13,980
There's something in place where I can 
trust that my sport really does care 

1226
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:14,380
about me.
I can trust that,

1227
00:57:14,470 --> 00:57:16,450
hey,
if my opponent is using,

1228
00:57:16,451 --> 00:57:18,910
he's risking at least his career,
you know,

1229
00:57:18,911 --> 00:57:23,911
go down the tubes so I can begin to 
trust that who I'm fighting is clean or 

1230
00:57:23,911 --> 00:57:27,280
just being really stupid.
We had this conversation in Brazil about

1231
00:57:27,281 --> 00:57:30,010
Vituro Belfort's levels.
Uh,

1232
00:57:30,011 --> 00:57:33,700
when he was tested during this camp for 
Chris Weidman.

1233
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:39,060
Vito Belfort was a guy who was on 
testosterone replacement because he 

1234
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:39,760
allegedly had low testosterone and you 
know,

1235
00:57:39,761 --> 00:57:43,630
he was making it out like he was a 
martyr and he needed medicine because,

1236
00:57:43,631 --> 00:57:45,850
you know,
he was sick and he had an issue and even

1237
00:57:45,851 --> 00:57:49,390
compared it to someone being a diabetic 
and needing insulin,

1238
00:57:49,391 --> 00:57:54,391
you have to give them their insulin,
which I thought was disingenuous and in 

1239
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:57,940
a lot of ways is kind of a crazy thing 
to say when everybody knows.

1240
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:03,460
It's not a mystery that he used to be 
240 pounds and he's 19 years old.

1241
00:58:03,461 --> 00:58:06,580
It's not a mystery that he was on 
testosterone replacement and looked like

1242
00:58:06,581 --> 00:58:11,581
a fucking gorilla.
And then during camp he tests three 

1243
00:58:11,711 --> 00:58:16,711
times higher than Weidman.
Weidman's tests at 300 Vittorio test at 

1244
00:58:16,711 --> 00:58:19,150
1200 and everybody was like,
well,

1245
00:58:19,151 --> 00:58:21,730
what the fuck is going on?
You know,

1246
00:58:21,731 --> 00:58:23,350
it wasn't a.
What am I saying?

1247
00:58:23,351 --> 00:58:23,860
The numbers,
right?

1248
00:58:23,861 --> 00:58:26,740
It was a four times higher or it was 
900,

1249
00:58:26,741 --> 00:58:27,550
1200,
1200,

1250
00:58:27,551 --> 00:58:28,490
right.
I think I was right.

1251
00:58:28,491 --> 00:58:31,060
Okay.
So he's four times higher.

1252
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:34,000
Right.
And he tells,

1253
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:36,040
you know,
Weidman tells him,

1254
00:58:36,041 --> 00:58:37,120
you know,
I'm going to punish you.

1255
00:58:37,210 --> 00:58:39,610
I know you were using in camp,
I'm going to punish you.

1256
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:44,850
But you were saying that it's not 
necessarily the case and that when 

1257
00:58:44,850 --> 00:58:48,520
someone tests at 1200 through a urine 
test,

1258
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:49,840
explain that.
How has.

1259
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:54,540
Yeah.
And I actually relied on experts to kind

1260
00:58:54,541 --> 00:58:59,290
of guide me through this,
but urine results like that,

1261
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:01,900
uh,
are depend on,

1262
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:03,400
I think it's called your excretion 
level.

1263
00:59:03,401 --> 00:59:08,401
Different people excrete out in urine,
different levels of testosterone depends

1264
00:59:08,861 --> 00:59:13,861
a lot on your metabolism.
One person could be a high excreta and 

1265
00:59:13,861 --> 00:59:17,770
one person could be a low Iq screener.
It's not necessarily a representation of

1266
00:59:17,771 --> 00:59:20,770
your true testosterone levels.
We've talked about earlier.

1267
00:59:20,771 --> 00:59:21,920
Blood tests would be

1268
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:25,340
way more accurate.
So why test him for urine at all?

1269
00:59:25,970 --> 00:59:26,450
Well,
I mean,

1270
00:59:26,451 --> 00:59:29,060
I think the urine test is done because 
it's a little bit cheaper.

1271
00:59:29,150 --> 00:59:33,050
They could initially look at the 
testosterone to epitestosterone ratio.

1272
00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:38,740
That is a pretty true marker and you're 
in the amount of testosterone that you 

1273
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:42,581
have to epitestosterone.
The levels can barely vary depending on 

1274
00:59:42,581 --> 00:59:45,020
how you're excluding out,
but that ratio,

1275
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:50,440
you know,
we'll stay will be very accurate of 

1276
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:51,980
what's in your body.
Normal human has a one to one ratio.

1277
00:59:53,030 --> 00:59:57,170
There are some variances on the positive
and on the plus and negative side.

1278
00:59:57,171 --> 01:00:00,860
And if you look at what vittores ratio 
was there,

1279
01:00:00,890 --> 01:00:03,950
it was within normal range.
Now you,

1280
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:06,410
but you allow up to four to one in 
Nevada.

1281
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:09,230
Is that still the case with the way the 
UFC has?

1282
01:00:09,231 --> 01:00:14,231
This new program is still four to one 
because he was six to one at one point 

1283
01:00:14,231 --> 01:00:15,050
in time that was criticized and it was 
dropped down to four to one.

1284
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:16,910
So that's gone out the window a little 
bit.

1285
01:00:16,990 --> 01:00:21,990
Um,
the ratio is looked at to determine 

1286
01:00:21,990 --> 01:00:25,691
whether or not you go to a more accurate
backup tests called we talked about 

1287
01:00:25,691 --> 01:00:26,780
earlier,
the carbon isotope ratio tests.

1288
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:29,230
So in all cases you know,
if,

1289
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:34,300
if,
if a test proves high over whatever the 

1290
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:34,300
number is,
three to one,

1291
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:38,360
four to one,
six to one than the termination is 

1292
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:38,360
usually made.
Hey,

1293
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:42,071
let's go to the definitive test carbon 
isotope to determine whether or not 

1294
01:00:42,071 --> 01:00:46,040
that's foreign based testosterone and if
it is foreign based testosterone,

1295
01:00:46,041 --> 01:00:48,680
how much of a time,
like once you get the test results,

1296
01:00:48,890 --> 01:00:51,800
like say if you test a guy and his urine
tests are kind of Funky,

1297
01:00:51,801 --> 01:00:55,400
he's reading really high and then you 
decide to go to a blood test.

1298
01:00:55,730 --> 01:01:00,730
If he's doing something like Alex 
Rodriguez was doing where it's like 

1299
01:01:00,730 --> 01:01:01,430
quick release or how would you describe 
it?

1300
01:01:01,430 --> 01:01:02,750
Quick,
quick half live,

1301
01:01:02,751 --> 01:01:03,630
what would you describe it?
Yeah,

1302
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:05,300
fast acting fast.
Ach Clearing,

1303
01:01:05,301 --> 01:01:07,520
fast clearing.
How would you,

1304
01:01:07,610 --> 01:01:11,090
how would you mitigate that?
So ask the question again.

1305
01:01:11,091 --> 01:01:16,091
So you do the.
So you do the one test and shows that 

1306
01:01:16,091 --> 01:01:16,680
he's got a very high level 1200.
Um,

1307
01:01:16,710 --> 01:01:18,830
and then you want to,
you want to do a blood test,

1308
01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:23,860
not necessarily you could go right to 
that same urine sample and do a 

1309
01:01:23,860 --> 01:01:24,620
different test or cir test on that.
So it can be.

1310
01:01:24,650 --> 01:01:29,650
So you don't do that.
Ordinarily the carbon isotope is not 

1311
01:01:29,650 --> 01:01:30,230
done immediately in our,
in our program.

1312
01:01:30,231 --> 01:01:32,420
It will be,
that will be as opposed to,

1313
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:33,530
you know,
hey,

1314
01:01:33,531 --> 01:01:37,160
let's do the testosterone 
epitestosterone ratio tests first.

1315
01:01:37,430 --> 01:01:39,830
In some cases we'll go right to the 
Usada,

1316
01:01:39,831 --> 01:01:43,640
we'll go right to the CIO,
our test and bypass the t ratio.

1317
01:01:43,641 --> 01:01:46,550
And that is because of the micro dosing 
issue.

1318
01:01:46,550 --> 01:01:50,120
So say like an Alex Rodriguez took a 
fast acting testosterone,

1319
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:55,160
didn't really manipulate his tat level 
too much if you were just doing that 

1320
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:59,021
test would show a two or three to one 
maybe and in the past and say,

1321
01:01:59,180 --> 01:01:59,960
okay,
well he's good.

1322
01:01:59,961 --> 01:02:02,270
He's under four to one or six to one.
Um,

1323
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:05,990
where if a car test was done on that,
they would have known right away that he

1324
01:02:05,991 --> 01:02:07,820
was using.
So under our program,

1325
01:02:08,390 --> 01:02:13,390
oftentimes the cir tests will be done 
right away regardless of what the t 

1326
01:02:13,390 --> 01:02:14,060
ratio is.
Okay.

1327
01:02:14,061 --> 01:02:17,190
So if you are doing with Alex,
Rodrigo was.

1328
01:02:17,690 --> 01:02:20,310
Rodriguez was doing,
even if he tests okay.

1329
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:25,340
Within his boundaries and normal levels,
you can do a cir test and catch him even

1330
01:02:26,851 --> 01:02:28,570
though it's out of a system.
Well,

1331
01:02:28,580 --> 01:02:28,950
no,
no.

1332
01:02:28,951 --> 01:02:31,020
If it's out of his system,
it's out of his system.

1333
01:02:31,021 --> 01:02:33,780
But if it's a four hour thing,
that's true.

1334
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:35,670
Is that actually the level.
I mean,

1335
01:02:35,950 --> 01:02:38,610
it really is gone for hours.
I mean,

1336
01:02:38,611 --> 01:02:41,820
that's what they say.
I'd be a little bit hesitant if I was an

1337
01:02:41,821 --> 01:02:43,360
athlete to depend on,
you know,

1338
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:45,240
I had a drug test in five hours.
It's,

1339
01:02:45,241 --> 01:02:47,100
something's going to clear in four 
hours.

1340
01:02:47,101 --> 01:02:52,101
They can detect pretty minute amounts,
but my understanding is it does clear 

1341
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:54,300
pretty quickly and you're going to ask 
guys in the middle of the night,

1342
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:55,970
uh,
the side,

1343
01:02:55,990 --> 01:02:58,110
it has the ability to do that.
I don't think they're gonna,

1344
01:02:58,160 --> 01:02:59,400
you know,
make that routine.

1345
01:02:59,401 --> 01:03:00,180
But if,
again,

1346
01:03:00,181 --> 01:03:05,181
this is all detective work,
if they're looking at biological 

1347
01:03:05,181 --> 01:03:09,111
passports over time and see variances 
between mornings and evenings,

1348
01:03:10,770 --> 01:03:12,930
they could get a tip or other 
information that's,

1349
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:14,550
you know,
non science related.

1350
01:03:14,551 --> 01:03:15,960
Just a tip from somebody that,
hey,

1351
01:03:15,961 --> 01:03:18,510
this is what's going on in this camp.
They'd had the ability to do that.

1352
01:03:18,510 --> 01:03:22,440
Yes.
I'm a tip.

1353
01:03:22,470 --> 01:03:27,470
Has that happened before?
Do you guys have tips from people like 

1354
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:27,500
the fighters are using?
There's a uh,

1355
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:32,570
so actually you saw it.
It has a hotline or a tip line that's 

1356
01:03:32,570 --> 01:03:32,570
given dollar athletes,
you know,

1357
01:03:32,570 --> 01:03:37,431
here's something about something going 
on from somebody or a camp they can 

1358
01:03:37,431 --> 01:03:38,490
anonymously call and lead that.
And you look back at,

1359
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:43,520
you look back at all of the major 
performance enhancing drug cases that 

1360
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:46,680
have come out over the past 15 years.
You look at Belko,

1361
01:03:46,681 --> 01:03:48,840
you look at Biogenesis,
uh,

1362
01:03:49,020 --> 01:03:51,090
you look at Kirk Radomski,
who in New York,

1363
01:03:51,091 --> 01:03:56,091
mets,
bat boy that was distributing to 

1364
01:03:56,091 --> 01:03:56,091
athletes.
There's a bat boy.

1365
01:03:56,091 --> 01:03:57,120
He was,
he was a clubhouse attendant.

1366
01:03:57,990 --> 01:04:00,270
The back boy was getting them dressed or
was.

1367
01:04:00,330 --> 01:04:01,680
Wow.
How they catch him.

1368
01:04:01,681 --> 01:04:03,030
Was He in jail now?
Uh,

1369
01:04:03,031 --> 01:04:03,690
he is,
uh,

1370
01:04:03,930 --> 01:04:07,650
he's a convicted felon.
I think he's done with probation.

1371
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,410
Um,
but all of those cases,

1372
01:04:10,411 --> 01:04:13,950
all the major cases that have happened 
over the last decade,

1373
01:04:13,951 --> 01:04:18,951
decade and a half all were a result of 
investigations not necessarily 

1374
01:04:18,951 --> 01:04:23,780
anti-doping side of things.
And you sorta who we're using is aware 

1375
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:28,131
of that.
They actually have someone on their 

1376
01:04:28,131 --> 01:04:30,321
staff,
former law enforcement who's 

1377
01:04:30,321 --> 01:04:32,730
investigator that will liaison and reach
out to various law enforcement agencies 

1378
01:04:32,730 --> 01:04:36,960
both here in the United States and 
internationally so that say another case

1379
01:04:36,961 --> 01:04:41,490
comes out and local law enforcement 
agency goes in and does a search warrant

1380
01:04:41,491 --> 01:04:43,040
and they find,
you know,

1381
01:04:43,050 --> 01:04:47,550
list of UFC athletes of what drugs they 
were getting or being distributed.

1382
01:04:48,030 --> 01:04:51,420
You saw it would have the ability 
hopefully to go to law enforcement said,

1383
01:04:51,421 --> 01:04:56,421
hey,
when you're done kind of with the 

1384
01:04:56,421 --> 01:04:56,421
criminal side of things here,
can you give us,

1385
01:04:56,421 --> 01:04:57,200
find a way to give us some of your 
evidence,

1386
01:04:57,230 --> 01:05:00,270
use it here and uh,
and use it that way.

1387
01:05:00,271 --> 01:05:01,260
So again,
Joe,

1388
01:05:01,261 --> 01:05:06,261
we're just trying to.
Our program has every resource available

1389
01:05:06,630 --> 01:05:11,630
that we know of science wise,
investigative lies to create that 

1390
01:05:11,630 --> 01:05:11,940
deterrent effect.
So athlete,

1391
01:05:11,941 --> 01:05:13,680
you may have found the newest,
latest,

1392
01:05:13,681 --> 01:05:16,140
greatest,
greatest strug that they will never be a

1393
01:05:16,141 --> 01:05:17,980
test for,
but you're running

1394
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:20,560
the risk of whoever's getting that for 
you at some point,

1395
01:05:20,910 --> 01:05:25,910
you know,
running along to some investigation and 

1396
01:05:25,910 --> 01:05:25,910
that information out and catching you on
the back door.

1397
01:05:25,910 --> 01:05:30,611
It's,
it's definitely happened a lot in the 

1398
01:05:30,611 --> 01:05:30,611
past.
And is that what happened with Bronco?

1399
01:05:30,611 --> 01:05:33,130
It was.
So Balco was a criminal investigation,

1400
01:05:33,370 --> 01:05:34,270
uh,
first,

1401
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:39,660
um,
and what we did there was interfaced 

1402
01:05:39,660 --> 01:05:42,361
with anti-doping.
So we discovered drugs in balco that 

1403
01:05:42,361 --> 01:05:44,190
were designer drugs that they were,
weren't tests for,

1404
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:47,920
and through the back door went to anti 
doping and said,

1405
01:05:47,921 --> 01:05:49,000
hey,
here's what we've got.

1406
01:05:49,001 --> 01:05:51,340
We're trying to figure out who palcos 
clients are,

1407
01:05:51,341 --> 01:05:52,990
what they're using.
If,

1408
01:05:52,991 --> 01:05:57,991
when we bring them in,
they're telling us the truth about what 

1409
01:05:57,991 --> 01:06:00,361
they've used.
So the anti-doping side of thing was 

1410
01:06:00,361 --> 01:06:03,430
able to develop tests for these drugs,
go out and test some of these athletes,

1411
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:08,520
both current samples provided and 
samples that were frozen and leftover 

1412
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:12,990
from previous provisions and kept some 
of those athletes for the drugs they 

1413
01:06:12,990 --> 01:06:13,240
were using.

1414
01:06:13,870 --> 01:06:18,870
They then pass that information back 
along to us so that when we go out and 

1415
01:06:18,870 --> 01:06:18,870
question athlete and they say,
I,

1416
01:06:18,870 --> 01:06:21,940
I didn't use anything we will to say 
you're full of shit now.

1417
01:06:21,941 --> 01:06:24,100
When you say it was a criminal 
investigation first,

1418
01:06:24,101 --> 01:06:27,430
what was the crime?
So actually that was back in my days,

1419
01:06:27,431 --> 01:06:32,431
I was a irs special agents.
So it involved a financial crime and 

1420
01:06:32,431 --> 01:06:36,750
money laundering.
So the taking of profits from Doug drug 

1421
01:06:36,750 --> 01:06:38,410
distribution and putting them back in 
the financial system.

1422
01:06:38,470 --> 01:06:43,470
Oh right.
Because they have to have some way to 

1423
01:06:43,470 --> 01:06:44,080
account for the money.
Correct.

1424
01:06:44,260 --> 01:06:49,260
Right.
Because you're making all these might 

1425
01:06:49,260 --> 01:06:49,260
look good.
How much does a guy like barry bonds pay

1426
01:06:49,260 --> 01:06:50,170
for for steroids to a guy like Victor 
Conte,

1427
01:06:50,230 --> 01:06:53,290
like how much does that work?
He was interesting because he didn't pay

1428
01:06:53,350 --> 01:06:56,320
anything.
He paid in the form of giving.

1429
01:06:56,321 --> 01:06:59,110
Advertise and it was really an ingenious
plan instead of,

1430
01:06:59,230 --> 01:07:01,420
you know,
in exchange for what I'm giving you,

1431
01:07:01,660 --> 01:07:06,660
you give me back money,
do advertising for my supplement 

1432
01:07:06,660 --> 01:07:08,740
company,
go in magazines and ads and say,

1433
01:07:08,741 --> 01:07:13,741
Hey,
you work with me and my supplements and 

1434
01:07:13,741 --> 01:07:13,930
they're the reason for your success,
like cma and stuff like that.

1435
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:15,850
Who knows what the value of that was of 
that.

1436
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:19,330
Advertise for a guy bonds millions.
It's really an engine.

1437
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:23,050
It was an ingenious plan.
Money Laundering plan.

1438
01:07:23,110 --> 01:07:25,870
I've had content here and Dana White 
fucking hates that guy,

1439
01:07:25,871 --> 01:07:27,700
but I found them to be a pleasant 
individual.

1440
01:07:28,060 --> 01:07:30,100
I didn't have a problem with him and he 
was very forthright.

1441
01:07:30,130 --> 01:07:35,130
He was very honest about what he did and
how he got away with it and what he 

1442
01:07:35,130 --> 01:07:37,540
thinks is going on right now.
A lot of people are suspicious of him of

1443
01:07:37,541 --> 01:07:42,541
course,
because I mean he's now like working as 

1444
01:07:42,541 --> 01:07:45,841
an anti performance enhancing drugs 
advocate when he became famous for being

1445
01:07:45,971 --> 01:07:49,510
a guy who provided performance enhancing
drugs to athletes.

1446
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:54,840
It's a weird sort of turnaround late in 
life and people or they're suspicious 

1447
01:07:56,090 --> 01:08:00,640
and rightly so,
but what he has,

1448
01:08:01,050 --> 01:08:06,050
what he has done is at least illuminates
what he was able to pull off.

1449
01:08:07,090 --> 01:08:12,090
Yeah.
I'm asking about him often and I always 

1450
01:08:12,090 --> 01:08:12,090
say,
Hey,

1451
01:08:12,090 --> 01:08:12,220
I,
I welcome anybody over to,

1452
01:08:12,330 --> 01:08:14,570
to the good side.
You believe him.

1453
01:08:15,050 --> 01:08:20,050
I'm a firm believer in second chances.
I think you have to have to take 

1454
01:08:20,050 --> 01:08:21,230
everything he says with a little bit of 
grain of salt.

1455
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:26,320
Um,
I read something the other day that he 

1456
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:28,901
still keeps a hand in kind of the dark 
world and that's where we learned about 

1457
01:08:28,901 --> 01:08:29,000
all this stuff.
And if you're truly,

1458
01:08:29,630 --> 01:08:34,630
if you're truly an anti-doping advocate 
and you know about things going on in 

1459
01:08:34,630 --> 01:08:37,100
the dark world and you're not exposing 
who those people are,

1460
01:08:37,101 --> 01:08:40,040
then you're really not truly an 
anti-doping advocate,

1461
01:08:40,041 --> 01:08:42,680
but a [inaudible] guy's a character.
I mean,

1462
01:08:42,681 --> 01:08:47,681
I enjoyed.
He's one of those guys and in my former 

1463
01:08:47,681 --> 01:08:50,891
career you run into a lot of characters 
like that and I enjoy everything about 

1464
01:08:50,891 --> 01:08:50,891
those people.

1465
01:08:50,891 --> 01:08:54,590
It's just living life and running into 
characters like that.

1466
01:08:54,591 --> 01:08:57,350
Whether in a good or bad way.
Fun.

1467
01:08:57,470 --> 01:09:01,370
You enjoy it because it's part of like 
the flavor of the Gig.

1468
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:06,520
Absolutely.
And also because you're a pretty 

1469
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:06,520
straight edge guy,
you know,

1470
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:07,670
like people are living on the edge like 
that.

1471
01:09:07,750 --> 01:09:09,980
It's always fun to see how the other 
side lives.

1472
01:09:11,060 --> 01:09:13,400
I don't trust anybody with a fucking 
mustache like that.

1473
01:09:13,430 --> 01:09:16,460
I'll tell you that when you get one of 
them little skinny mustaches,

1474
01:09:16,580 --> 01:09:18,380
there's just very few people that I 
trust.

1475
01:09:18,530 --> 01:09:23,530
Maybe a couple of black eyes,
maybe some people of Puerto Rican 

1476
01:09:23,530 --> 01:09:23,530
descent and have a little skinny 
mustache,

1477
01:09:23,530 --> 01:09:26,360
but I dunno content that you've seen his
mustache.

1478
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:32,160
Yeah.
It's a psalm about that mustache and 

1479
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:32,160
makes me go,
hmm.

1480
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:32,500
You know,
I just hope at some point when,

1481
01:09:32,540 --> 01:09:34,610
because he does.
He's got a bit of a platform,

1482
01:09:34,740 --> 01:09:36,860
you know,
still a lot of tell you had them in here

1483
01:09:37,510 --> 01:09:38,240
without mustache.

1484
01:09:38,890 --> 01:09:41,570
Get out of here dog.
Come on son.

1485
01:09:43,250 --> 01:09:44,140
I'm waiting for it.
You know,

1486
01:09:44,150 --> 01:09:45,650
he's been critical of me.
I'm waiting for.

1487
01:09:46,690 --> 01:09:48,720
I'm waiting for a thank you from him for
him.

1488
01:09:48,750 --> 01:09:52,120
Vocal to the good side.
What's his criticism in A.

1489
01:09:52,610 --> 01:09:54,550
I don't even know,
don't listen to it,

1490
01:09:54,590 --> 01:09:57,500
don't listen to it really good for you.
Um,

1491
01:09:57,830 --> 01:09:58,760
Aldo,
Josie,

1492
01:09:58,761 --> 01:10:03,761
although has said that he won't do the 
Ivy or that he won't listen to the band 

1493
01:10:03,761 --> 01:10:07,901
on Ivs,
he's going to take it and he said 

1494
01:10:07,901 --> 01:10:07,901
they'll still let me fight.
You know,

1495
01:10:07,901 --> 01:10:08,570
what do you think about that?
Actually,

1496
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:10,550
when we were in Brazil a couple of weeks
ago,

1497
01:10:10,551 --> 01:10:15,551
had a conversation with them about that 
and you said it was just one of those 

1498
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:17,950
days where he was in a certain mood,
uh,

1499
01:10:18,110 --> 01:10:23,110
maybe a little bit joking,
maybe a little bit pissed off about 

1500
01:10:23,110 --> 01:10:23,360
something else and said those things and
said he shouldn't have.

1501
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:26,330
Doesn't believe those,
you apologize for doing that.

1502
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:31,360
And uh,
so I felt pretty good at conor mcgregor 

1503
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:33,110
felt that way.
Crawl inside that Dude's head and camped

1504
01:10:33,111 --> 01:10:35,480
out,
planted flags shit all over the place.

1505
01:10:35,481 --> 01:10:40,481
I mean,
that guy was dealing with some serious 

1506
01:10:40,481 --> 01:10:42,191
psychological warfare at a level that I 
don't think he had ever experienced 

1507
01:10:42,191 --> 01:10:42,191
before.
It was.

1508
01:10:42,191 --> 01:10:43,400
Connor is really good at that,
isn't he?

1509
01:10:43,490 --> 01:10:46,040
He's the best.
He's the best.

1510
01:10:46,041 --> 01:10:51,041
It's like he took Mohamad Ali and chill 
Sunnen and he rolled it up in this crazy

1511
01:10:51,530 --> 01:10:54,420
Celtic warrior character.
It just and just.

1512
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:57,320
And He's good.
That's the thing.

1513
01:10:57,530 --> 01:11:00,020
He's not just trash-talker,
he's fucking dangerous.

1514
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:04,880
It's a once in a lifetime personality 
and he pulls it off consistently.

1515
01:11:04,881 --> 01:11:06,740
He's always on his game.
Well,

1516
01:11:06,741 --> 01:11:08,690
the fact that it was willing to Bet Dana
and Lorenzo,

1517
01:11:08,691 --> 01:11:13,691
$3,000,000,
it would knock Mendez out in the second 

1518
01:11:13,691 --> 01:11:13,691
round and he knocked Mendez out in the 
second round.

1519
01:11:13,950 --> 01:11:15,450
I mean,
he's a fucking freak.

1520
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:17,040
He really is.
He's a freak.

1521
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:19,230
I wonder if it,
if it comes naturally or you sits.

1522
01:11:19,231 --> 01:11:21,420
It sits around at night plotting these 
things out.

1523
01:11:22,150 --> 01:11:23,280
So damn good at it.
Well,

1524
01:11:23,281 --> 01:11:28,281
he was always a very good fighter.
I was a big fan of his when he was 

1525
01:11:28,281 --> 01:11:30,981
competing in Europe and you know,
he's fighting in the UK and quite an 

1526
01:11:30,981 --> 01:11:34,930
actually I tweeted him way back in the 
day before he ever came to the UFC 

1527
01:11:34,930 --> 01:11:37,230
saying that I enjoy his fights and I 
hope he gets over here.

1528
01:11:37,231 --> 01:11:39,600
And then boy,
did he get over here.

1529
01:11:39,660 --> 01:11:44,660
Jesus Christ.
I mean that UFC wayans when he fought 

1530
01:11:44,660 --> 01:11:48,771
Mendez was the craziest thing I've ever 
seen in my life of all the fights that 

1531
01:11:48,841 --> 01:11:51,300
have ever called all the weigh ins that 
I've ever been at.

1532
01:11:51,450 --> 01:11:53,940
I have never seen anything like that in 
America.

1533
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:56,670
And it was like we were in Dublin,
so it's amazing.

1534
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:58,080
I'm,
I'm four months into this,

1535
01:11:58,081 --> 01:12:00,410
so I'm a Newbie,
so I expect that now.

1536
01:12:00,910 --> 01:12:03,050
Don't know.
That was,

1537
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:05,970
that was a total outlier.
I've never seen any expected.

1538
01:12:05,971 --> 01:12:10,971
If he fights again though,
in a bigger way in December when he 

1539
01:12:10,971 --> 01:12:11,070
fights,
although Jesus Christ,

1540
01:12:11,071 --> 01:12:16,071
that's going to be crazy if,
although makes it to it without getting 

1541
01:12:16,071 --> 01:12:16,071
injured and he makes it to it without 
getting injured.

1542
01:12:16,071 --> 01:12:18,140
Which is a big problem with this sport.
You know,

1543
01:12:18,150 --> 01:12:21,660
if you look at boxing matches,
boxing matches that get arranged and how

1544
01:12:21,661 --> 01:12:24,210
many of them actually come to fruition?
It's most of them,

1545
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:26,890
most fights gets scheduled.
They'd come and they,

1546
01:12:26,891 --> 01:12:30,300
they actually,
they come to pass with the UFC.

1547
01:12:30,330 --> 01:12:32,790
It's,
it's maybe 70 percent,

1548
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:34,590
you know,
maybe 70 May.

1549
01:12:34,690 --> 01:12:35,730
I mean,
I might be wrong,

1550
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:38,520
but if I had to guess like big fights,
75 at the most,

1551
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:40,230
25 percent of them fall out.

1552
01:12:40,230 --> 01:12:42,150
It seems like just.
It's interesting,

1553
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:44,840
it's another,
it's lagging behind a little bit,

1554
01:12:44,850 --> 01:12:49,850
the anti-doping side,
because that's taken up so much of my 

1555
01:12:49,850 --> 01:12:49,850
time,
but it's another responsibility under my

1556
01:12:49,850 --> 01:12:52,860
title is to try to provide our athletes 
reach out,

1557
01:12:52,861 --> 01:12:56,040
provide them with other resources.
In terms of training,

1558
01:12:56,041 --> 01:13:01,041
rehabilitation.
We've reached out to a couple of 

1559
01:13:01,041 --> 01:13:01,710
companies here domestically,
exos,

1560
01:13:01,740 --> 01:13:06,740
which there's a lot of training for NFL 
exos or out of what does that x o,

1561
01:13:09,410 --> 01:13:11,820
s and what do they do?
Their training facility?

1562
01:13:11,821 --> 01:13:12,580
Yeah,
so they,

1563
01:13:12,660 --> 01:13:15,780
they are most widely known from taking 
shoot.

1564
01:13:15,781 --> 01:13:18,540
If you look at most of the first round 
draft picks in the NFL,

1565
01:13:18,541 --> 01:13:21,360
they've gone and trained at exos from,
you know,

1566
01:13:21,361 --> 01:13:26,361
their end of their last season in 
college through the combine and they've 

1567
01:13:26,401 --> 01:13:29,940
just instituted good nutrition,
good training methods.

1568
01:13:30,630 --> 01:13:32,850
We've contracted with them a couple 
months ago,

1569
01:13:32,851 --> 01:13:34,560
sent a couple athletes down there.

1570
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:37,920
Um,
I think Rashad Evans went down a forest,

1571
01:13:37,921 --> 01:13:40,230
went down kind of from an internal 
perspective,

1572
01:13:40,231 --> 01:13:45,231
look at things.
I think Luke rockhold went down their 

1573
01:13:45,231 --> 01:13:45,231
cm,
punk is retired.

1574
01:13:45,231 --> 01:13:50,181
He is,
and he went down there to look at 

1575
01:13:50,181 --> 01:13:52,880
experience week of training.
So the idea is to get our athletes to 

1576
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:54,000
train smarter,
to listen to their bodies,

1577
01:13:54,390 --> 01:13:56,140
to uh,
you know,

1578
01:13:56,141 --> 01:13:59,190
give them techniques and proper 
nutrition,

1579
01:13:59,250 --> 01:14:04,250
things like that.
So that as our guys are training 

1580
01:14:04,250 --> 01:14:04,830
smarter,
listening to their bodies better,

1581
01:14:04,890 --> 01:14:07,800
there will be less instances of getting 
injured.

1582
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:12,920
You know,
coming up to big fights in the UFC is 

1583
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:12,920
developing some sort of a performance

1584
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:13,420
center,
correct?

1585
01:14:13,980 --> 01:14:16,200
Correct.
We are that,

1586
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:18,480
I think they're breaking ground pretty 
soon on that,

1587
01:14:18,510 --> 01:14:23,510
but the idea would be through consulting
with these other companies that had been

1588
01:14:23,881 --> 01:14:28,881
in the business of training high level 
athletes to putting all these resources 

1589
01:14:29,221 --> 01:14:34,221
and tools and machines and space 
available to this state of the art world

1590
01:14:34,381 --> 01:14:38,730
class facility that our athletes would 
have the ability to come to and train to

1591
01:14:38,731 --> 01:14:43,290
come to an rehabilitate.
Not only UFC athletes,

1592
01:14:43,291 --> 01:14:47,040
but I think the idea is to make this 
place so state of the arts that we would

1593
01:14:47,041 --> 01:14:49,410
welcome in athletes from other sports 
that,

1594
01:14:49,411 --> 01:14:54,411
hey,
this is the world class place to go to 

1595
01:14:54,411 --> 01:14:58,131
your training and learn how to do your 
training and a similar that as we're 

1596
01:14:58,131 --> 01:15:00,600
doing with our anti-doping program,
hoping to lead the pack.

1597
01:15:00,601 --> 01:15:04,710
The idea is to lead the pack in terms of
how we teach our athletes that train.

1598
01:15:05,610 --> 01:15:10,610
Is there a consensus though on the 
correct way to train as far as strength 

1599
01:15:11,331 --> 01:15:16,331
and conditioning goes as far as like how
much time to spend doing skill work 

1600
01:15:16,331 --> 01:15:18,810
versus how much time to spend during 
endurance work.

1601
01:15:19,350 --> 01:15:24,350
There seems like there's a lot of debate
and then there's a lot of athletes very 

1602
01:15:24,751 --> 01:15:27,510
as far as their needs,
their style of fighting.

1603
01:15:27,511 --> 01:15:29,400
Like how would you manage something like
that?

1604
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:34,500
Yeah.
That's a tough one for me that I'm a be 

1605
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:34,500
the first to admit.
Just learning and coming up to speed.

1606
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:39,361
I mean,
you probably know better and your 

1607
01:15:39,361 --> 01:15:39,670
involvement in mma and what it feels 
like to train in which you would need to

1608
01:15:39,671 --> 01:15:44,671
do in your training to be able to ready 
to get into a real fight a month or a 

1609
01:15:46,180 --> 01:15:48,040
couple of weeks later.
I'll turn that back around on you.

1610
01:15:48,041 --> 01:15:53,041
What do you think in terms of how close 
to a fight these guys need to be going 

1611
01:15:53,041 --> 01:15:54,100
full speed so that when they get in that
octagon,

1612
01:15:54,101 --> 01:15:56,290
it's not a shock to the system like holy
shit

1613
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:57,460
going on?
Well,

1614
01:15:57,461 --> 01:16:02,461
it depends on who you ask because 
there's a lot of people that I respect 

1615
01:16:02,461 --> 01:16:05,330
that very wide wildly on how they 
approach things like you'll.

1616
01:16:05,390 --> 01:16:10,390
You'll talk to one guy who's a strength 
and conditioning coach and he has this 

1617
01:16:10,390 --> 01:16:13,831
very specific idea of how you should 
train and then another guy who was also 

1618
01:16:13,831 --> 01:16:15,220
very well respected but completely 
different methodology.

1619
01:16:15,790 --> 01:16:20,790
I'm a big fan of what Marv Marinovich 
was able to do with Bj Penn and the 

1620
01:16:20,790 --> 01:16:23,230
amount of work that he did with Bj's 
endurance.

1621
01:16:23,410 --> 01:16:28,410
I think that Bj during that time was 
just one of the greatest of all time 

1622
01:16:28,410 --> 01:16:32,640
during the time we fought to Diego 
Sanchez and Sean Sherk and when Bj was 

1623
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:37,081
in his prime and I know during the Diego
Sanchez fight in particular was an 

1624
01:16:37,081 --> 01:16:41,400
absolutely brutal camp for him and he 
went and worked with him for only a 

1625
01:16:43,331 --> 01:16:46,330
couple of fights because it was so,
so goddamn brutal,

1626
01:16:46,690 --> 01:16:51,190
but a lot of people think and nick curse
on who was a protege of Marinovich.

1627
01:16:51,190 --> 01:16:53,620
I've had him on the podcast.
We discussed it pretty,

1628
01:16:53,650 --> 01:16:57,640
pretty deep and he thinks and I liked 
the way he thinks.

1629
01:16:58,060 --> 01:17:03,060
He believes that strength and 
conditioning during camp is everything 

1630
01:17:03,060 --> 01:17:04,810
and that's really what you should 
primarily focus on.

1631
01:17:04,990 --> 01:17:09,990
That these guys already know how to 
fight and that really they should be 

1632
01:17:09,990 --> 01:17:11,150
putting almost all of their effort into 
conditioning.

1633
01:17:11,330 --> 01:17:16,330
Getting their body to the point where 
their body can perform at an extremely 

1634
01:17:16,330 --> 01:17:18,890
high level for five rounds,
five minutes each and that all the other

1635
01:17:18,891 --> 01:17:23,891
skill work and everything like that 
should actually take a back seat to 

1636
01:17:23,891 --> 01:17:26,651
conditioning.
Because what you're dealing with when 

1637
01:17:26,651 --> 01:17:28,691
you're dealing with a championship level
fight like that is an athlete that's so 

1638
01:17:28,691 --> 01:17:32,441
finely tuned in skill wise already that 
really what you need to do is give them 

1639
01:17:32,441 --> 01:17:35,770
the horsepower and give him the gas tank
and that also would,

1640
01:17:36,110 --> 01:17:41,110
that also would do is it would prevent 
the really hard training that is 

1641
01:17:41,110 --> 01:17:46,001
breaking guys down like the really hard 
wrestling training that's breaking guys 

1642
01:17:46,001 --> 01:17:46,001
down.

1643
01:17:46,001 --> 01:17:49,420
Instead of doing that,
you would just drill and instead of 

1644
01:17:49,420 --> 01:17:49,490
doing these hard sparring drills,
you would just drill.

1645
01:17:49,700 --> 01:17:54,700
Matter of fact,
Tim Kennedy was just on the fighter and 

1646
01:17:54,700 --> 01:17:57,371
the kid podcast with Brian Kaylin and 
Brendan Schaub and Brendan texted me 

1647
01:17:57,371 --> 01:17:59,120
last night and said that Kennedy said he
doesn't spar,

1648
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:04,600
said he just doesn't spark city moves 
around with guys and he just does 

1649
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:04,600
strength and conditioning work and 
everything like that.

1650
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:06,050
He said,
but the sparring,

1651
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:08,480
like if you take enough punishment 
fighting,

1652
01:18:08,750 --> 01:18:13,750
so he's.
He's of the mindset that you shouldn't 

1653
01:18:13,750 --> 01:18:17,441
be beating yourself up in the gym.
So I think there's a lot of variation 

1654
01:18:17,441 --> 01:18:17,441
there.

1655
01:18:17,441 --> 01:18:17,441
Yeah,
I agree.

1656
01:18:17,441 --> 01:18:19,850
I think that's something that exos 
promotes,

1657
01:18:19,851 --> 01:18:21,770
is that it depends on,
you know,

1658
01:18:21,771 --> 01:18:23,460
an athlete,
individual to individual,

1659
01:18:23,461 --> 01:18:25,100
some are,
are different than others.

1660
01:18:25,850 --> 01:18:30,850
One thing that they did tell us was they
were just amazed and getting back to 

1661
01:18:30,850 --> 01:18:34,901
kind of the weight cutting thing that an
athlete who's going to compete 24 hours 

1662
01:18:34,901 --> 01:18:39,311
later,
it's putting their body through such 

1663
01:18:39,311 --> 01:18:41,470
extreme conditions just 24 hours before 
and the fact that that's going to have 

1664
01:18:41,470 --> 01:18:45,971
on your performance when you do an 
extreme cut and then put that weight 

1665
01:18:45,971 --> 01:18:45,971
back on.
Um,

1666
01:18:45,971 --> 01:18:46,220
and that,
you know,

1667
01:18:46,221 --> 01:18:51,221
during the off season when you don't 
have a fight scheduled and you're maybe 

1668
01:18:51,221 --> 01:18:52,730
even 20 pounds heavier than that,
you know,

1669
01:18:52,731 --> 01:18:57,731
the muscle memory of getting used to 
working out at that 20 pounds heavier 

1670
01:18:57,731 --> 01:19:00,710
than you're actually going to be 
fighting a doesn't seem to make a lot of

1671
01:19:00,711 --> 01:19:05,711
common sense because you're fighting is 
a completely different feel and person 

1672
01:19:05,711 --> 01:19:06,890
and muscle mass.
Um,

1673
01:19:06,891 --> 01:19:07,340
that,
that,

1674
01:19:07,341 --> 01:19:08,030
that,
you know,

1675
01:19:08,060 --> 01:19:10,280
training wise doesn't seem to make a lot
of sense.

1676
01:19:10,281 --> 01:19:11,570
So I don't know,
again,

1677
01:19:11,571 --> 01:19:16,571
I'm new to all this and trying to be as 
a sponge and absorb everything and uh,

1678
01:19:17,380 --> 01:19:18,910
yeah,
I've seen the horror stories.

1679
01:19:19,210 --> 01:19:21,880
I've seen guys cut too much weight,
just fight like shit.

1680
01:19:21,881 --> 01:19:25,420
And I've seen guys that really blew 
their opportunity of being champion.

1681
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:28,870
The best example that I've ever used as 
Travis Luder,

1682
01:19:29,230 --> 01:19:34,230
Travis Luder.
It was one of the best American black 

1683
01:19:34,230 --> 01:19:34,230
belts in Brazilian Jujitsu,
especially at the time.

1684
01:19:34,540 --> 01:19:36,940
He was just extremely high level black 
belt,

1685
01:19:36,941 --> 01:19:38,350
very,
very technical,

1686
01:19:38,351 --> 01:19:42,850
very strong and fought Anderson Silva.
It didn't make weight,

1687
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:43,960
didn't make weight.
And,

1688
01:19:43,990 --> 01:19:46,810
and when I tell you that he was on 
fucking death's door,

1689
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:49,210
I've never,
in all my years of watching fights,

1690
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:50,750
uh,
watching weigh ins,

1691
01:19:50,970 --> 01:19:55,970
seeing guys look dehydrated,
I'd never seen anybody look as bad as 

1692
01:19:55,970 --> 01:19:55,970
him.
His lips were cracked,

1693
01:19:55,970 --> 01:19:58,240
like you could see like he'll like 
cracks in his lips.

1694
01:19:58,241 --> 01:20:01,210
His lips had shrunken down and like his,
his,

1695
01:20:01,330 --> 01:20:06,330
like he was chapped,
his face was completely sunk and scary 

1696
01:20:06,330 --> 01:20:06,700
and he was shuffling.

1697
01:20:06,730 --> 01:20:11,730
He Walk to the scale,
he was shuffling and he didn't make the 

1698
01:20:11,730 --> 01:20:15,021
weight and he tried for like an hour and
a half afterwards to try to make the 

1699
01:20:15,021 --> 01:20:15,990
weight still.
The next day took Anderson Silva down,

1700
01:20:16,050 --> 01:20:18,870
mounted him was on top of them and I'll 
tell you what,

1701
01:20:18,871 --> 01:20:22,650
if travis was 100 percent right there,
he would've submitted Anderson.

1702
01:20:22,790 --> 01:20:27,790
Like Travis was submitting.
Everybody who's was just kinda blood 

1703
01:20:27,790 --> 01:20:28,670
will like Charles Mccarthy who was a 
friend of mine,

1704
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:32,010
have train with them in the house.
He said it was like rolling with Ricardo

1705
01:20:32,010 --> 01:20:37,010
Laborio.
He said his level was like super high 

1706
01:20:37,010 --> 01:20:38,871
level and blues chance and really never,
never sort of reached the full potential

1707
01:20:41,220 --> 01:20:42,750
after that.
But that was,

1708
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:47,840
that was like the worst I've ever seen 
is like a guy who just blew his 

1709
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:47,840
potential.

1710
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:51,760
I'll tell you an interesting stat.
I think it was the American Journal of 

1711
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:51,760
Sports Medicine,
so they had a,

1712
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:56,550
a dehydration rehydration study and they
had certain percentages of dehydration 

1713
01:20:56,550 --> 01:21:01,271
and what that meant to a body,
and I think it was seven percent or 

1714
01:21:01,271 --> 01:21:04,010
more,
your cognitive skills decline immensely.

1715
01:21:04,011 --> 01:21:08,630
And I think it was 15 percent dehydrated
in the study.

1716
01:21:08,631 --> 01:21:12,230
It's a death imminent death organs shut 
down 15 percent.

1717
01:21:12,231 --> 01:21:13,430
Start doing the numbers,
Joe,

1718
01:21:13,431 --> 01:21:16,490
of what some of these cuts that you've 
heard about and seen.

1719
01:21:16,491 --> 01:21:21,491
I heard one the other day,
someone on the radio talking about an 

1720
01:21:21,491 --> 01:21:24,881
athlete that they had that was one 74 
days before a way in and went down I 

1721
01:21:26,721 --> 01:21:30,200
think to 1:45
and do the math on knots.

1722
01:21:30,201 --> 01:21:35,201
Assuming all that weight cut was water.
I don't know if that's actually the 

1723
01:21:35,201 --> 01:21:38,861
case,
but probably in where you're talking 

1724
01:21:38,861 --> 01:21:38,861
about your time,
that's almost 15 percent.

1725
01:21:38,861 --> 01:21:39,860
Conor mcgregor when he fought Chad 
Mendez,

1726
01:21:39,861 --> 01:21:44,861
he looked like a dead man.
I mean you could see people were 

1727
01:21:44,861 --> 01:21:44,861
commenting and online.
They like Jesus Christ,

1728
01:21:44,861 --> 01:21:46,280
look at him.
Can a guide like that?

1729
01:21:46,610 --> 01:21:48,650
A guy like that who's fighting a guy 
like Mendez,

1730
01:21:48,651 --> 01:21:53,651
Kennett guy like that in 24 hours orally
rehydrate properly.

1731
01:21:55,210 --> 01:21:56,950
Yeah.
I don't know what the question of that.

1732
01:21:56,951 --> 01:21:57,550
I mean,
I think,

1733
01:21:58,030 --> 01:22:03,030
I think our athletes are outliers.
They are the toughest individual,

1734
01:22:04,460 --> 01:22:06,430
you know,
their genetic freaks to begin with.

1735
01:22:06,431 --> 01:22:11,431
So you know,
maybe this common science doesn't quite 

1736
01:22:11,431 --> 01:22:13,540
apply to them by the exact number,
but I tell you,

1737
01:22:13,541 --> 01:22:18,541
it's something we had,
we had a meeting the other day with our 

1738
01:22:18,541 --> 01:22:19,540
operation staff and our fighters come in
on Monday or Tuesday and the first thing

1739
01:22:19,550 --> 01:22:23,680
I do is weigh a men just to kind of get 
an idea of hey,

1740
01:22:23,681 --> 01:22:27,010
where they're looking at,
they do a body or water company that I'm

1741
01:22:27,011 --> 01:22:32,011
aware of,
but I tell you I'm going to start being 

1742
01:22:32,011 --> 01:22:33,080
aware of kind of what these numbers are 
coming in versus you know,

1743
01:22:33,100 --> 01:22:35,020
what,
what the ultimate way it is.

1744
01:22:35,021 --> 01:22:37,150
And again,
just trying to be,

1745
01:22:37,180 --> 01:22:42,180
you know,
not trying to be the police but trying 

1746
01:22:42,180 --> 01:22:43,951
to be an advocate and maybe sit down 
with some of these fighters as a hey 

1747
01:22:43,951 --> 01:22:43,951
look,
look what the studies show here,

1748
01:22:43,951 --> 01:22:45,340
you know,
look what you're subjecting yourself to.

1749
01:22:45,370 --> 01:22:46,990
Maybe you can get away with it,
you know,

1750
01:22:46,991 --> 01:22:51,991
on the outside.
But on the inside these things don't go 

1751
01:22:51,991 --> 01:22:52,720
away and you're probably doing,
you know,

1752
01:22:52,721 --> 01:22:54,820
lasting damage.
Have you talked to any x fighters?

1753
01:22:54,821 --> 01:22:59,821
I've talked to a few about that.
Have ongoing kidney problems are 

1754
01:22:59,821 --> 01:22:59,821
probably going to have the rest of their
life.

1755
01:22:59,821 --> 01:23:04,770
Fibroid problems where their thyroid is 
all messed up from these extreme weight 

1756
01:23:04,770 --> 01:23:08,251
cuts.
It's definitely there if you have to 

1757
01:23:08,251 --> 01:23:08,251
have

1758
01:23:08,251 --> 01:23:08,251
a statement.
Yeah,

1759
01:23:08,251 --> 01:23:08,251
it's devastating.
And well,

1760
01:23:08,251 --> 01:23:10,350
Daniel Cormier didn't make the Olympic 
team because was in.

1761
01:23:10,420 --> 01:23:13,030
Didn't compete in the Olympics because 
of his kidneys shutting down.

1762
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:14,200
Um,
it's a,

1763
01:23:14,201 --> 01:23:16,000
it's a giant,
giant problem.

1764
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:17,500
Um,
it's just,

1765
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:21,050
it's awful and it doesn't.
Here's the thing for a guy like,

1766
01:23:21,051 --> 01:23:26,051
although when a guy like mcgregor,
what really people want to see is what 

1767
01:23:26,051 --> 01:23:26,620
they want to see.
Aldo fight mcgregor,

1768
01:23:26,680 --> 01:23:31,680
right?
They don't give a fuck if they weigh in 

1769
01:23:31,680 --> 01:23:33,601
at 1:45,
then rehydrate backup to whatever the 

1770
01:23:33,601 --> 01:23:33,601
hell they weighed before that.
That's nonsense.

1771
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:37,570
What they should do is figure out where 
are these guys are healthy,

1772
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:38,500
like,
where are you healthy?

1773
01:23:38,501 --> 01:23:40,210
Then we're going to see the best fight 
out of these guys.

1774
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:44,260
The problem is the title.
The title is everything,

1775
01:23:44,290 --> 01:23:45,520
right?
You want to be.

1776
01:23:45,700 --> 01:23:48,730
Chris Weidman is the UFC middleweight 
champion of the world.

1777
01:23:48,850 --> 01:23:51,430
If Chris Weidman releases his title and 
says,

1778
01:23:51,431 --> 01:23:56,431
look,
I can't make the UFC one 85 pound limit 

1779
01:23:56,431 --> 01:23:56,431
anymore because of this new,
um,

1780
01:23:56,431 --> 01:24:00,880
and non ivy using policy,
so I'm just going to drop the title 

1781
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:05,640
Chris Weidman and could still have huge,
super fights because he's Chris Weidman 

1782
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:06,310
and everybody knows he's a bad 
motherfucker.

1783
01:24:06,580 --> 01:24:08,120
So if he decided to fight at two,
oh,

1784
01:24:08,140 --> 01:24:10,210
five or whatever,
people are going to line up.

1785
01:24:10,330 --> 01:24:12,640
It doesn't matter if it's for the title,
he's got a name.

1786
01:24:12,670 --> 01:24:15,310
Rhonda Rousey has a name,
connor has a name,

1787
01:24:15,550 --> 01:24:17,830
but there's a lot of guys that just 
don't have a name.

1788
01:24:17,831 --> 01:24:19,340
So for those guys,
it's that,

1789
01:24:19,390 --> 01:24:21,160
that,
that title is critical.

1790
01:24:21,580 --> 01:24:26,580
The difference between Robbie lawler 
fighting Carlos condit just in a fight 

1791
01:24:26,580 --> 01:24:28,270
and Robbie lawler fighting crime was 
kind of as a champion.

1792
01:24:28,570 --> 01:24:30,910
It's too big goddamn difference.
It's a big difference.

1793
01:24:30,970 --> 01:24:34,330
And that's unfortunate because I think 
that this,

1794
01:24:34,460 --> 01:24:34,970
the,
the,

1795
01:24:35,030 --> 01:24:40,030
the situation that they're in right now 
where they have to hit this specific 

1796
01:24:40,030 --> 01:24:41,110
weight class,
I think we should match guys up based on

1797
01:24:41,111 --> 01:24:46,111
their size and not based on weighing in 
24 hours beforehand.

1798
01:24:46,420 --> 01:24:51,420
At a very specific way,
I think it's dangerous and I also think 

1799
01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:51,420
it's irrelevant.

1800
01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:51,970
I don't think it matters.
I mean,

1801
01:24:51,971 --> 01:24:56,971
I think there's advantages that guys 
would have if they were a more than a 

1802
01:24:56,971 --> 01:24:57,920
certain amount over their opponent or 
less than a certain amount of,

1803
01:24:57,980 --> 01:25:02,980
you know,
there's a way that you could mitigate 

1804
01:25:02,980 --> 01:25:04,741
that though.
There's a way that you could figure out 

1805
01:25:04,741 --> 01:25:04,741
like what,
what,

1806
01:25:04,741 --> 01:25:06,190
what is the range of these guys could 
weigh in,

1807
01:25:06,220 --> 01:25:10,990
but make sure that they are within the 
range of dehydration within the range of

1808
01:25:10,991 --> 01:25:14,410
body composition and then they're not 
fucking with the numbers any.

1809
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:16,660
Let's find out what you actually weigh.
What,

1810
01:25:16,820 --> 01:25:19,300
what does Johnny Hendricks actually way,
when he fights,

1811
01:25:19,420 --> 01:25:22,090
when Johnny Hendricks is at his best,
that's where Johnny Hendricks,

1812
01:25:22,091 --> 01:25:27,091
you'd be fighting.
What about Tyron Woodley all those guys 

1813
01:25:27,091 --> 01:25:27,820
and figure out where everybody belongs 
and then compete at that level.

1814
01:25:27,940 --> 01:25:30,360
But everybody's competing for titles.
You know,

1815
01:25:30,370 --> 01:25:33,490
and I think that is part of the problem 
is the 1:55

1816
01:25:33,491 --> 01:25:36,010
pound title,
the one 70 pound title.

1817
01:25:36,190 --> 01:25:41,190
But really what we want to see as the 
best fighters fighting against the best 

1818
01:25:41,190 --> 01:25:41,190
fighters.
That's where the money's at.

1819
01:25:41,220 --> 01:25:42,360
Yeah,
I hear you.

1820
01:25:42,570 --> 01:25:44,090
I don't think there's,
you know,

1821
01:25:44,150 --> 01:25:45,670
a simple answer to this.
I think it's,

1822
01:25:45,730 --> 01:25:50,730
you know,
it's a process and steps and then all I 

1823
01:25:50,730 --> 01:25:50,730
can say is,
and I already am beating this,

1824
01:25:50,730 --> 01:25:52,300
but I'm going to be the squeaky wheel 
here that,

1825
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:57,360
you know,
hopefully at some point squeaks enough 

1826
01:25:57,360 --> 01:25:57,360
that,
you know,

1827
01:25:57,360 --> 01:25:57,970
get some grease into this.
And in terms of the fighters,

1828
01:25:57,971 --> 01:26:01,560
hey,
I have just one interest at mind.

1829
01:26:01,570 --> 01:26:06,570
My one goal in one interest and that's 
looking out for their health short and 

1830
01:26:06,570 --> 01:26:10,091
longterm with everything we're doing 
with this anti doping program with the 

1831
01:26:10,091 --> 01:26:10,580
ivy ban.
I mean it,

1832
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:11,900
it is.
Ultimately,

1833
01:26:11,901 --> 01:26:16,901
I,
I challenge anyone to say that I don't 

1834
01:26:16,901 --> 01:26:16,901
have that,
you know,

1835
01:26:16,901 --> 01:26:18,170
at the forefront of what we're trying to
do here.

1836
01:26:18,470 --> 01:26:21,560
I certainly think you do,
but I just think that the ivy band,

1837
01:26:21,561 --> 01:26:26,561
without some sort of weight class 
management is almost like 

1838
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:31,960
counterintuitive.
I think there has to be something that 

1839
01:26:31,960 --> 01:26:34,631
allows these guys who they've got like 
Weidman is worked so hard to get to the 

1840
01:26:34,631 --> 01:26:39,580
185 pound title to all of a sudden he 
can't make it anymore because you can't 

1841
01:26:39,580 --> 01:26:43,901
use [inaudible].
It just seems ridiculous because you 

1842
01:26:43,901 --> 01:26:45,410
have a policy that he's too dehydrated 
and you check them and you find out what

1843
01:26:45,411 --> 01:26:50,411
he's doing to get to one 85.
Even though he's been doing his whole 

1844
01:26:50,411 --> 01:26:50,411
career.
You guys step in and say,

1845
01:26:50,411 --> 01:26:54,521
Hey,
this is too dangerous and we're not 

1846
01:26:54,521 --> 01:26:54,521
gonna allow you to do it anymore.
That's,

1847
01:26:54,521 --> 01:26:55,010
you know,
it's kind of crazy.

1848
01:26:55,011 --> 01:27:00,011
If he's gotta move up 20 pounds.
He's already talked about fighting Jon 

1849
01:27:00,011 --> 01:27:04,240
Jones statement he made recently and 
there's one thing I love about this guy 

1850
01:27:04,240 --> 01:27:08,050
said he wants to fight the best guys in 
the world and he says if Weidman or if 

1851
01:27:08,050 --> 01:27:09,380
John Jones rather comes back,
he goes,

1852
01:27:09,381 --> 01:27:14,381
I have to fight this guy because he's 
the best and I'm not leaving the sport 

1853
01:27:14,381 --> 01:27:17,120
until I fight Jon Jones and because he's
the best at two,

1854
01:27:17,121 --> 01:27:17,630
oh five.

1855
01:27:17,630 --> 01:27:22,250
And so he wants to do that,
but I just think that,

1856
01:27:23,300 --> 01:27:28,300
I think the,
making the weight cut and making that 

1857
01:27:28,300 --> 01:27:30,461
way classes probably reducing his career
and probably reducing a lot of these 

1858
01:27:30,461 --> 01:27:31,190
athletes' careers.
They can do it,

1859
01:27:31,191 --> 01:27:34,100
they get through it,
but at what price and that price is,

1860
01:27:34,101 --> 01:27:37,130
I'm sure cumulative.
It has to be.

1861
01:27:37,430 --> 01:27:39,230
Yeah,
I hear everything you're saying Joe.

1862
01:27:39,250 --> 01:27:40,110
Um,
you know,

1863
01:27:40,750 --> 01:27:43,640
I don't think I say as this program has 
been up and running now for a month,

1864
01:27:43,700 --> 01:27:46,580
month and a half,
I'm generally don't listen to me,

1865
01:27:46,581 --> 01:27:47,420
man.
They gotta listen to you.

1866
01:27:47,450 --> 01:27:49,670
They think I'm crazy.
You gotta you gotTa talk to them.

1867
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:54,760
Weight classes,
more weight classes and all the people 

1868
01:27:54,760 --> 01:27:56,420
who support shut up dummies.
Shut up.

1869
01:27:56,450 --> 01:28:01,450
All of you.
You don't know what you're talking 

1870
01:28:01,450 --> 01:28:01,450
about.

1871
01:28:01,450 --> 01:28:04,370
Just fucking sport is so filled with 
crazy people.

1872
01:28:04,490 --> 01:28:06,500
They're willing to do anything to win.
I mean,

1873
01:28:06,501 --> 01:28:11,501
that's one of the,
one of the things about the weight cut 

1874
01:28:11,501 --> 01:28:13,990
is that the amount of effort,
that titanic effort that it takes to get

1875
01:28:14,301 --> 01:28:19,301
down to some of these weight classes and
rehydrate and compete against world 

1876
01:28:19,301 --> 01:28:23,021
class athlete,
world class athletes and the toughest 

1877
01:28:23,021 --> 01:28:23,021
sport in the world.
Twenty four hours later.

1878
01:28:23,021 --> 01:28:25,220
It's just nuts.
They're superhuman on so many levels,

1879
01:28:25,490 --> 01:28:28,310
so many levels.
The fighting skills,

1880
01:28:28,460 --> 01:28:33,140
their ability to withstand pain.
It's just incredible.

1881
01:28:33,290 --> 01:28:38,290
The mental toughness to the mental 
toughness that it takes to go through 

1882
01:28:38,290 --> 01:28:38,660
those weight cuts and then compete 24 
hours later.

1883
01:28:38,661 --> 01:28:43,661
It's just insane.
So we were talking earlier about the 

1884
01:28:43,661 --> 01:28:48,341
designer drugs that you're catching 
people on or these drugs that they're 

1885
01:28:48,341 --> 01:28:51,800
testing that they like.
We were talking about the cyclist.

1886
01:28:52,520 --> 01:28:56,210
Is there anything else that's like that 
that you may see coming up?

1887
01:28:57,050 --> 01:29:02,050
Possibly.
I mean I don't have anything for you 

1888
01:29:02,050 --> 01:29:02,280
here today,
but there's

1889
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:06,600
constantly drugs in clinical trial phase
that could have an application to,

1890
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:12,120
you know,
performance enhancement and how do you 

1891
01:29:12,120 --> 01:29:12,420
guys stay on top of that stuff?
Like what is,

1892
01:29:12,450 --> 01:29:17,450
what's the method of making sure that 
you're aware of every new thing that 

1893
01:29:17,450 --> 01:29:21,981
these guys are doing to try to get some 
sort of an advantage and when these 

1894
01:29:21,981 --> 01:29:22,830
things should be legal and illegal?
Yeah.

1895
01:29:22,831 --> 01:29:23,570
What's.
I mean that's,

1896
01:29:23,630 --> 01:29:28,630
that's the role of the anti-doping 
authorities and you saw to who we use 

1897
01:29:28,630 --> 01:29:31,731
and they constantly interact and 
interface with the pharmaceutical 

1898
01:29:31,731 --> 01:29:32,940
industry so that way they know these 
things run the pipeline.

1899
01:29:33,450 --> 01:29:34,710
They can get a look at,
hey,

1900
01:29:34,711 --> 01:29:37,290
what's potentially performance enhancing
or not?

1901
01:29:37,291 --> 01:29:41,310
I think the pharmaceutical companies 
been pretty cooperative about it.

1902
01:29:41,430 --> 01:29:46,210
I mean financially they could probably 
care less but you know,

1903
01:29:46,230 --> 01:29:49,110
it doesn't look good.
I think when they have a product like an

1904
01:29:49,111 --> 01:29:54,111
EPO,
which is a great drug for someone who 

1905
01:29:54,111 --> 01:29:57,261
has cancer,
Rosa anemic and helps your body create 

1906
01:29:57,261 --> 01:29:58,830
red blood cells that you need to live 
great drug,

1907
01:29:59,340 --> 01:30:04,340
but then you know,
most of the press about it as athletes 

1908
01:30:04,340 --> 01:30:04,340
that are using it to cheat.

1909
01:30:04,340 --> 01:30:09,110
So I think it's good for our reputation 
standpoint for the pharmaceutical 

1910
01:30:09,110 --> 01:30:10,220
industry to,
you know,

1911
01:30:10,350 --> 01:30:15,350
get on top of these things and seeing 
what the application could be in and 

1912
01:30:15,350 --> 01:30:18,690
helping anti-doping with that.
Is there a window where these guys are 

1913
01:30:18,690 --> 01:30:22,251
going to be able to use certain things 
that you guys haven't caught onto yet 

1914
01:30:22,251 --> 01:30:24,780
that are actually legal for them at a 
certain point,

1915
01:30:24,781 --> 01:30:29,781
like some natural supplements perhaps 
that turn out to be like a little bit 

1916
01:30:29,781 --> 01:30:33,471
too effective.
Like how do you make that distinction 

1917
01:30:33,471 --> 01:30:33,471
potentially and that that really lies 
with water.

1918
01:30:33,471 --> 01:30:38,310
The world antidoping agency and they are
constantly monitoring things.

1919
01:30:38,311 --> 01:30:39,780
There's certain things,
I forget what it was,

1920
01:30:39,781 --> 01:30:43,230
we were talking last week,
but they have things on their watch list

1921
01:30:43,710 --> 01:30:48,710
so that something like you just talked 
about could be some type of legal 

1922
01:30:48,710 --> 01:30:50,040
supplement and they're taking a look at 
it and studying it.

1923
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:51,900
What are the performance enhancing 
benefits?

1924
01:30:51,901 --> 01:30:54,350
Does it have side effects were that,
you know,

1925
01:30:54,370 --> 01:30:59,370
if you had athlete and say hey,
I don't want to risk myself to those 

1926
01:30:59,370 --> 01:30:59,490
side effects,
so I don't want to use that.

1927
01:30:59,491 --> 01:31:04,491
Even if it is legal,
as somebody's gaining an unfair 

1928
01:31:04,491 --> 01:31:04,491
advantage because they're willing to 
risk,

1929
01:31:04,491 --> 01:31:08,421
so side effects.
So it's a constant monitoring process 

1930
01:31:08,421 --> 01:31:11,340
being done by the top level anti-doping 
authority,

1931
01:31:11,341 --> 01:31:16,341
which is water.
Now what about unintentional 

1932
01:31:16,341 --> 01:31:17,610
contamination?
Anderson Silva just got through this big

1933
01:31:17,611 --> 01:31:22,611
crazy trial in Vegas,
which I'm sure you watched those in the 

1934
01:31:22,611 --> 01:31:22,611
front row.
I was right behind him.

1935
01:31:22,611 --> 01:31:26,900
What the hell was that about?
The songs that kept playing I was 

1936
01:31:26,900 --> 01:31:28,860
hearing was disturbing on so many 
levels.

1937
01:31:28,980 --> 01:31:33,210
So many explain to people what I'm 
talking about because for some they hear

1938
01:31:33,211 --> 01:31:34,350
it from me.
They're gonna think I'm kidding.

1939
01:31:34,590 --> 01:31:37,580
Like explain what was going on.
So they had a,

1940
01:31:37,770 --> 01:31:40,020
they had a little conference call 
device,

1941
01:31:40,021 --> 01:31:45,021
which they have actually a couple of 
scientists on the line for that were 

1942
01:31:45,021 --> 01:31:48,021
testifying about some of his tests and 
somebody out there was able to get the 

1943
01:31:48,021 --> 01:31:50,580
number and in the middle of the hearing 
was playing these songs.

1944
01:31:50,581 --> 01:31:53,710
Uh,
so let's say he was taught,

1945
01:31:53,711 --> 01:31:57,420
he was testifying about the Cialis that 
he thought was cialis that he was using.

1946
01:31:57,421 --> 01:31:59,980
And like a shaggy came on,

1947
01:32:00,310 --> 01:32:02,580
salt and pepper song came on.
Yeah,

1948
01:32:02,581 --> 01:32:07,581
it was.
Songs about sex kept coming on during 

1949
01:32:07,581 --> 01:32:07,690
the.
It'll be such a zoo.

1950
01:32:07,720 --> 01:32:09,520
The whole thing was just so ridiculous.
Yeah.

1951
01:32:09,550 --> 01:32:13,420
It wasn't good.
It was great for people that were paying

1952
01:32:13,421 --> 01:32:14,470
attention.
I mean,

1953
01:32:14,471 --> 01:32:16,480
the courtroom burst out in laughter.
Yeah.

1954
01:32:16,481 --> 01:32:17,020
But it's,
I mean,

1955
01:32:17,070 --> 01:32:21,250
sad somebodies career,
reputation at stake in a bright.

1956
01:32:21,310 --> 01:32:22,360
I mean,
to me that's.

1957
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:25,300
I'm all about having a little humor 
injected into things,

1958
01:32:25,301 --> 01:32:27,650
but I hated to see that.
Um,

1959
01:32:28,090 --> 01:32:28,870
I.
well,

1960
01:32:30,100 --> 01:32:31,820
I can't say I hated it.
I,

1961
01:32:32,030 --> 01:32:37,030
it was just too funny to me.
I think the whole thing was odd in the 

1962
01:32:37,030 --> 01:32:37,030
first place.
Um,

1963
01:32:37,030 --> 01:32:41,520
the,
the argument is for folks who hadn't 

1964
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:44,971
heard that,
that he was taking or the excuses that 

1965
01:32:44,971 --> 01:32:47,971
he was taking liquid cialis that was 
apparently made in the laboratory that 

1966
01:32:47,971 --> 01:32:52,801
also made steroids and that this liquid 
cialis was tainted unintentionally.

1967
01:32:53,770 --> 01:32:58,770
Like you get a vat of stuff and you mix 
it all together and then you throw the 

1968
01:32:58,770 --> 01:33:00,130
new stuff and the next VAT and you 
haven't cleaned it.

1969
01:33:00,520 --> 01:33:05,520
His story was it was liquid.
Cialis from a friend that he recently 

1970
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:07,960
got to know that came from Thailand in a
blue on mark vial,

1971
01:33:08,650 --> 01:33:11,620
which is crazy,
but if you're gonna make something up,

1972
01:33:11,621 --> 01:33:14,380
but you really make that up.
I would lead,

1973
01:33:14,620 --> 01:33:19,150
lend more credibility to that story 
because of the personal nature of taking

1974
01:33:19,151 --> 01:33:22,630
it and maybe the embarrassing,
the embarrassment around taking that.

1975
01:33:22,631 --> 01:33:23,650
He have come in and said,
hey,

1976
01:33:23,651 --> 01:33:26,560
I used the protein powder and found 
something in it.

1977
01:33:26,680 --> 01:33:29,170
Right.
I would lend some credibility to that.

1978
01:33:29,620 --> 01:33:30,210
Well,
uh,

1979
01:33:30,310 --> 01:33:32,230
you know,
I had alluded to that on this show.

1980
01:33:32,620 --> 01:33:37,620
I didn't,
didn't express the exact nature of the 

1981
01:33:37,620 --> 01:33:41,011
issue,
but I'd known about this for a long 

1982
01:33:41,011 --> 01:33:41,011
time.

1983
01:33:41,011 --> 01:33:42,280
I had heard about the liquid cialis 
excuse for a long time,

1984
01:33:42,490 --> 01:33:47,490
but if I'm correct,
he said that he had taken that same 

1985
01:33:47,531 --> 01:33:52,531
steroid,
went while he was healing from his 

1986
01:33:52,531 --> 01:33:54,010
broken leg.
I'm pretty sure that he had said that he

1987
01:33:54,011 --> 01:33:56,980
had taken it before to heal his broken 
leg.

1988
01:33:57,200 --> 01:34:01,570
And then when he was surprised was that 
he had tested negative during camp,

1989
01:34:01,571 --> 01:34:06,571
but then positive after the fight and 
that's when they decided to check out 

1990
01:34:06,571 --> 01:34:07,900
the liquid cialis.
I wasn't,

1991
01:34:07,930 --> 01:34:10,350
I wasn't aware of of that.
That didn't come up in the,

1992
01:34:10,351 --> 01:34:12,790
in the here and yeah,
that's my boss route and was critical of

1993
01:34:12,791 --> 01:34:15,940
it boss route and was saying that he's 
changed his story more than once.

1994
01:34:16,450 --> 01:34:19,360
And boss was saying that,
that this is what he had said,

1995
01:34:19,361 --> 01:34:22,720
that he had taken it to heal up his leg 
and then you know,

1996
01:34:22,900 --> 01:34:25,750
then it was this new excuse with the 
liquid cialis.

1997
01:34:25,990 --> 01:34:30,990
And if there's a lesson I learned over 
the years of seeing so many of these 

1998
01:34:30,990 --> 01:34:33,700
high profile athletes kind of get 
brought to the table and you know,

1999
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:38,760
their reputations kind of tarnished 
forever is come to the table and just be

2000
01:34:41,201 --> 01:34:43,450
transparent and miss exactly.
Transparency.

2001
01:34:43,451 --> 01:34:46,360
That the public is very forgiving,
very forgiving.

2002
01:34:46,780 --> 01:34:51,780
Especially in a sport like this where 
most people believe that a large 

2003
01:34:51,780 --> 01:34:56,251
percentage of the athletes at one point 
in time have done something that at 

2004
01:34:56,251 --> 01:34:58,310
least now would not be legal,
including testosterone replacement,

2005
01:34:58,310 --> 01:35:01,160
which was legal just a little bit more 
than a year ago in Nevada.

2006
01:35:01,220 --> 01:35:03,170
Which again,
going back to what I said,

2007
01:35:03,171 --> 01:35:05,270
the,
the understanding of why things happen,

2008
01:35:05,300 --> 01:35:08,180
my personal understanding of why 
athletes shows to go that route.

2009
01:35:08,420 --> 01:35:09,950
I think most of the public will be like 
that.

2010
01:35:09,951 --> 01:35:12,590
Hey,
there wasn't much testing going on.

2011
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:17,640
You know,
maybe a couple weeks out the night of 

2012
01:35:17,640 --> 01:35:17,640
the fight,
um,

2013
01:35:17,640 --> 01:35:21,340
you know,
you were probably stupid if you weren't 

2014
01:35:21,340 --> 01:35:21,860
doing something based on your risk and 
your life every time you got in there.

2015
01:35:22,250 --> 01:35:25,760
So definitely under those circumstances.
Now under the new one here,

2016
01:35:25,790 --> 01:35:30,790
and I don't think people should be as 
forgiving because everybody should know 

2017
01:35:30,790 --> 01:35:31,070
now how serious this is,
that it's,

2018
01:35:31,100 --> 01:35:36,100
you know,
year round that there are serious 

2019
01:35:36,100 --> 01:35:38,270
consequences and the risk is far going 
to outweigh the reward.

2020
01:35:38,271 --> 01:35:40,500
Hopefully.
Now,

2021
01:35:40,910 --> 01:35:45,910
as far as inadvertent contamination,
as far as accidental dosing,

2022
01:35:47,270 --> 01:35:52,270
you,
if you buy something from some protein 

2023
01:35:52,270 --> 01:35:53,480
powder or vitamin that comes from some 
shop,

2024
01:35:53,900 --> 01:35:55,320
you know and you don't know,
you know,

2025
01:35:55,340 --> 01:35:58,070
it's supposed to boost testosterone 
naturally or something like that,

2026
01:35:58,071 --> 01:35:59,480
and then it turns out that steroids in 
it.

2027
01:35:59,660 --> 01:36:03,080
How often does that happen?
Is that a real issue with athletes or is

2028
01:36:03,081 --> 01:36:08,081
it a bullshit excuse they use to cover 
up the fact that it took steroids are 

2029
01:36:08,081 --> 01:36:12,040
real issue,
so my career I just left to come to the 

2030
01:36:12,040 --> 01:36:15,431
UFC.
I was with the Food and Drug 

2031
01:36:15,431 --> 01:36:15,431
Administration Office of Criminal 
Investigation.

2032
01:36:15,431 --> 01:36:19,241
We investigated the dietary sports 
supplement and industry and there's 

2033
01:36:20,361 --> 01:36:25,361
hundreds of products out there on the 
shelves with steroids over the counter 

2034
01:36:25,361 --> 01:36:30,310
with steroids and other substances which
would cause our athletes to test 

2035
01:36:30,310 --> 01:36:34,631
positive for and as we're getting out 
and going out and educating our 

2036
01:36:34,631 --> 01:36:36,140
athletes,
that is a huge portion of the education.

2037
01:36:36,650 --> 01:36:40,490
It is that you have to be more than 
careful,

2038
01:36:40,610 --> 01:36:45,610
extreme careful about what you take.
Ultimately you're liable for everything 

2039
01:36:45,610 --> 01:36:47,000
that goes into your body.
Hey,

2040
01:36:47,001 --> 01:36:52,001
we'll be here and will be a resource for
you to help kind of Wade through those 

2041
01:36:52,001 --> 01:36:53,210
issues and those,
those landmines that are out there,

2042
01:36:53,211 --> 01:36:56,150
but ultimately you're responsible for 
what goes in your body.

2043
01:36:56,540 --> 01:37:01,540
Now we have built in our policy 
mitigating factors that can reduce 

2044
01:37:01,540 --> 01:37:02,980
sanctions so that if somebody,
you know,

2045
01:37:03,110 --> 01:37:08,110
did test positive for steroids,
they were able to show because they kept

2046
01:37:08,751 --> 01:37:10,580
a sample of it.
Um,

2047
01:37:10,640 --> 01:37:13,310
they told us what the lot number with 
the bottle was.

2048
01:37:13,311 --> 01:37:15,920
Someone went and got that off the shelf 
to ensure that hey,

2049
01:37:15,921 --> 01:37:17,750
they didn't just spike the sample that 
they had,

2050
01:37:18,230 --> 01:37:23,230
that there was that steroid in it,
that there were other circumstances 

2051
01:37:23,230 --> 01:37:23,230
about,
you know,

2052
01:37:23,230 --> 01:37:25,640
occurrences like that,
something like that could,

2053
01:37:26,030 --> 01:37:29,240
could be grounds for a reduction and 
sanctioned to as low as,

2054
01:37:29,241 --> 01:37:34,241
you know,
maybe a public warning for the first 

2055
01:37:34,241 --> 01:37:34,241
time maybe.
Um,

2056
01:37:34,241 --> 01:37:38,260
but nevertheless there's still going to 
be some type of sanction and that'll be 

2057
01:37:38,260 --> 01:37:41,711
your first one.
So that the next one that came about 

2058
01:37:41,711 --> 01:37:41,711
could,
you know,

2059
01:37:41,711 --> 01:37:42,950
double potential penalties.
So it's tough issue,

2060
01:37:42,951 --> 01:37:43,130
man.

2061
01:37:43,130 --> 01:37:47,390
One that I worry about a lot because all
of our fighters take supplements.

2062
01:37:47,720 --> 01:37:50,510
We're not going to get up there and say 
don't take supplements.

2063
01:37:50,511 --> 01:37:52,840
Anybody I don't think that's realistic.
And they say,

2064
01:37:52,850 --> 01:37:53,470
hey,
John,

2065
01:37:53,630 --> 01:37:58,630
contradicting.
If you think about the fact that all 

2066
01:37:58,630 --> 01:37:59,190
these athletes takes off elements,
right,

2067
01:37:59,191 --> 01:38:04,191
why are they taking supplements?
Why gain in performance enhancing 

2068
01:38:04,191 --> 01:38:09,020
advantage?
How much of an advantage that we're 

2069
01:38:09,020 --> 01:38:09,020
talking and talking supplements you're 
talking,

2070
01:38:09,020 --> 01:38:10,500
you know,
derivatives of food.

2071
01:38:10,680 --> 01:38:15,680
I'm talking drugs here,
but some of these derivatives of food 

2072
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:17,820
had been known to enhance testosterone 
development or production.

2073
01:38:17,850 --> 01:38:19,040
Theoretically,
no,

2074
01:38:19,070 --> 01:38:24,070
I haven't seen tests.
Some of these natural testosterone 

2075
01:38:24,070 --> 01:38:24,070
boosters.
Uh,

2076
01:38:24,070 --> 01:38:24,510
you know,
personally,

2077
01:38:24,511 --> 01:38:28,590
I think a lot of it's Hocus pocus and 
just marketing and sales pitches.

2078
01:38:28,770 --> 01:38:30,300
Well,
the standard ones,

2079
01:38:30,390 --> 01:38:33,840
things like creatine,
we know that has an athletic advantage.

2080
01:38:33,870 --> 01:38:36,450
There's a performance enhancing benefit 
of creatine,

2081
01:38:36,510 --> 01:38:37,620
but creatines legal,
right?

2082
01:38:37,770 --> 01:38:38,430
It is.
Yep.

2083
01:38:38,790 --> 01:38:42,150
So the amount is just small enough so 
that it's not,

2084
01:38:42,690 --> 01:38:44,040
it's under the wire,
it doesn't,

2085
01:38:44,100 --> 01:38:49,100
it doesn't reach this steroid,
like level where you guys have to step 

2086
01:38:49,100 --> 01:38:52,671
in and say.
I guess that would be the reasoning why 

2087
01:38:52,671 --> 01:38:52,671
water has not prohibited Korea,
10 that,

2088
01:38:52,671 --> 01:38:56,630
you know,
in terms of the level of what it's 

2089
01:38:56,630 --> 01:38:56,630
really going to do for you.
It's,

2090
01:38:56,630 --> 01:39:01,021
it's minor is zero and avenue that 
fighters have where they can send you 

2091
01:39:01,021 --> 01:39:02,370
guys stuff that they're thinking about 
taking.

2092
01:39:02,371 --> 01:39:04,890
And then you could test it like say if a
guy is at,

2093
01:39:05,010 --> 01:39:10,010
you know,
some vitamin store or something like 

2094
01:39:10,010 --> 01:39:10,410
that and see some human growth hormone 
booster,

2095
01:39:10,411 --> 01:39:12,960
that's all amino acids and totally 
natural.

2096
01:39:12,961 --> 01:39:13,590
And I'm like,
ah,

2097
01:39:13,591 --> 01:39:14,910
I don't know man,
can we,

2098
01:39:14,970 --> 01:39:16,440
can they send it to you?
Uh,

2099
01:39:16,460 --> 01:39:18,630
now we don't have anything in place 
where they can send it to us.

2100
01:39:18,640 --> 01:39:19,620
That would be,
you know,

2101
01:39:19,890 --> 01:39:23,100
I'm sure we get inundated with things 
and be spending money.

2102
01:39:23,101 --> 01:39:25,200
We could be spending on a testing on 
that.

2103
01:39:25,201 --> 01:39:30,120
But what they do do is shoot.
I get 20 to 30 a week,

2104
01:39:30,150 --> 01:39:32,940
maybe emails from athletes about,
hey,

2105
01:39:32,941 --> 01:39:34,680
here's what I'm taking.
Can I take this one?

2106
01:39:35,220 --> 01:39:36,420
Um,
that one.

2107
01:39:36,421 --> 01:39:41,421
And typically what I do is for that to 
United States antidoping agency you saw 

2108
01:39:42,261 --> 01:39:44,210
to where they,
uh,

2109
01:39:44,250 --> 01:39:45,090
actually have,
uh,

2110
01:39:45,091 --> 01:39:47,230
a phd,
a woman who's,

2111
01:39:47,500 --> 01:39:52,500
she is probably the nation's expert on 
dietary supplements and she buys you 

2112
01:39:53,551 --> 01:39:58,551
Sato will buy on their own hundred or so
a year and test them theirselves.

2113
01:39:59,220 --> 01:40:03,660
They actually have a website that lists 
a lot of these that have tested positive

2114
01:40:03,661 --> 01:40:08,400
for substances that would be a positive 
test under our program.

2115
01:40:08,910 --> 01:40:11,640
So yeah,
we're constantly answering questions,

2116
01:40:11,641 --> 01:40:16,641
providing resource.
But ultimately I tell everybody and 

2117
01:40:16,641 --> 01:40:19,071
they're disappointed that I say I could 
never give you 100 percent green light 

2118
01:40:19,071 --> 01:40:19,140
to take something.

2119
01:40:19,590 --> 01:40:21,630
I can't on the other side,
say 100 percent,

2120
01:40:21,631 --> 01:40:24,150
don't touch that one.
I can give you red flags.

2121
01:40:24,151 --> 01:40:25,230
But you know,
even,

2122
01:40:25,860 --> 01:40:28,560
you know,
the most reputable company that sells,

2123
01:40:28,700 --> 01:40:33,700
you know their vitamin in Costco,
you don't know about that one bottle 

2124
01:40:34,141 --> 01:40:37,290
from that one batch.
I gave you the horror story of all time.

2125
01:40:37,291 --> 01:40:38,670
And it's in the,
it's in the news,

2126
01:40:38,671 --> 01:40:43,671
you can google it and read it.
But there was a a vitamin company that 

2127
01:40:43,830 --> 01:40:46,740
had a vitamin B,
I don't know if it was 12,

2128
01:40:46,741 --> 01:40:49,890
I think it was manufactured in long 
island a couple of years back,

2129
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:54,820
and the guy that was manufacturing it on
the run before vitamin took,

2130
01:40:54,821 --> 01:40:59,500
did a run of a raw product that he got 
from some guy in the south.

2131
01:41:00,250 --> 01:41:05,250
Ran that through the machine with 
instructions of how much to put in each 

2132
01:41:05,250 --> 01:41:05,470
capsule.
Sent that off to the guy in the south.

2133
01:41:05,770 --> 01:41:08,020
The vitamin companies product is next on
the machine.

2134
01:41:08,021 --> 01:41:09,610
You didn't clean the machine off well 
enough,

2135
01:41:10,270 --> 01:41:13,060
and that previous product had a 
designer,

2136
01:41:13,150 --> 01:41:15,910
anabolic steroids,
super drawl mythos drone,

2137
01:41:15,911 --> 01:41:18,970
which is one of the most powerful 
anabolic steroids.

2138
01:41:18,971 --> 01:41:22,670
It's orally taken.
That got into the [inaudible].

2139
01:41:23,870 --> 01:41:27,740
The [inaudible] I'm sure I'm thinking it
was maybe a.

2140
01:41:28,050 --> 01:41:32,890
I mean it was a reputable retail store 
or it was sold a week or two later.

2141
01:41:33,010 --> 01:41:36,850
Elderly people started presenting 
themselves at hospitals in this area.

2142
01:41:36,851 --> 01:41:40,870
What was being sold with yellow eyes,
yellow palms.

2143
01:41:41,200 --> 01:41:46,200
Because they were ingesting a vitamin 
that had his very toxic steroid in it 

2144
01:41:46,200 --> 01:41:47,980
and they were getting sick from liver 
damage.

2145
01:41:48,580 --> 01:41:53,580
Luckily that's the extreme,
but there have been cases of and we 

2146
01:41:53,580 --> 01:41:55,840
talked and then we start talking to 
sports supplement and industry,

2147
01:41:55,841 --> 01:41:56,560
which is,
you know,

2148
01:41:56,570 --> 01:41:58,990
testosterone boosters,
maybe more edgy stuff.

2149
01:41:59,020 --> 01:42:01,300
You see that happen way more often.

2150
01:42:01,720 --> 01:42:03,550
I invite you after it go on.
You saw it aside.

2151
01:42:03,551 --> 01:42:06,850
It's publicly available.
A supplement for one one.

2152
01:42:06,910 --> 01:42:11,910
They have listed all of the dietary 
supplements that they've bought this 

2153
01:42:11,910 --> 01:42:13,240
year and tested.
I was just looking at it last night.

2154
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:17,020
I don't know if it's over 100,
but it's probably more than 50 in there,

2155
01:42:17,380 --> 01:42:22,150
which the public can still go out and 
buy a there on the shelves of stores and

2156
01:42:22,151 --> 01:42:24,370
they contain,
in many instances,

2157
01:42:24,730 --> 01:42:29,050
anabolic steroids in all instances,
compounds which would cause our athletes

2158
01:42:29,051 --> 01:42:30,730
to test positive.
Wow,

2159
01:42:30,731 --> 01:42:33,250
that's crazy.
There's that many of these things.

2160
01:42:33,400 --> 01:42:34,600
Here it is right here.
There it is.

2161
01:42:34,630 --> 01:42:35,890
Supplement four,
one one.

2162
01:42:35,891 --> 01:42:37,750
Realize,
recognize and reduce.

2163
01:42:37,780 --> 01:42:40,000
So if you scroll down,
Scroll Down Syndrome list,

2164
01:42:40,330 --> 01:42:41,710
keep going,
go,

2165
01:42:41,740 --> 01:42:46,740
go back up a little bit.
High risk list there on the left high 

2166
01:42:46,740 --> 01:42:47,890
risk supplement products.
Are you going to have to enter?

2167
01:42:47,891 --> 01:42:51,490
You can put my name in there baby.
Put Joe's name and there you have to put

2168
01:42:51,491 --> 01:42:52,590
it on.
Were searching.

2169
01:42:53,110 --> 01:42:54,540
I think the idea behind,
Ya know,

2170
01:42:54,570 --> 01:42:59,570
motherfucker,
the idea behind that is actually a 

2171
01:42:59,570 --> 01:43:01,270
protection of the athlete so that if you
went in there,

2172
01:43:01,410 --> 01:43:06,410
um,
and you put your name in and then later 

2173
01:43:06,410 --> 01:43:06,410
said,
hey,

2174
01:43:06,410 --> 01:43:06,880
I went and searched,
you know,

2175
01:43:07,120 --> 01:43:09,420
you saw it as site.
Um,

2176
01:43:09,490 --> 01:43:11,830
there will be a record of,
of you haven't searched that.

2177
01:43:13,330 --> 01:43:15,640
All right,
let's see what we got here.

2178
01:43:16,850 --> 01:43:17,660
Okay,
got it.

2179
01:43:18,360 --> 01:43:21,710
What do we got?
All these different.

2180
01:43:24,450 --> 01:43:26,840
You're scrolling down,
but scroll the page down for.

2181
01:43:26,841 --> 01:43:28,950
So we get a full screen.
So there you go.

2182
01:43:29,360 --> 01:43:34,360
Zero liquid and that stuff has got dag.
A product contains a list of prohibited 

2183
01:43:38,371 --> 01:43:43,371
substance label lists a prohibited 
substance product contains prohibitive 

2184
01:43:43,371 --> 01:43:47,370
in testing revealed presence of one 
Andrew [inaudible] dial.

2185
01:43:47,400 --> 01:43:48,990
And that stuff's illegal.
Now though,

2186
01:43:48,991 --> 01:43:53,991
isn't it interesting that those 
prohormones he used to be able to sell 

2187
01:43:53,991 --> 01:43:53,991
those?
There is.

2188
01:43:53,991 --> 01:43:55,490
It was a new law passed.
It was late last year,

2189
01:43:55,491 --> 01:43:56,960
early this year,
the designer,

2190
01:43:57,050 --> 01:44:02,050
anabolic steroid control act or Baska 
and it basically made it easier to 

2191
01:44:02,091 --> 01:44:06,260
quantify some of these designer drugs as
steroids and took a whole bunch of known

2192
01:44:06,261 --> 01:44:08,570
ones that weren't on the steroid.
Yes.

2193
01:44:08,630 --> 01:44:11,090
List yet and converted them to control 
Sepsis,

2194
01:44:11,330 --> 01:44:14,750
but here we're still only at the aes on 
product name on the list.

2195
01:44:14,990 --> 01:44:17,150
This is a crazy list.
Look,

2196
01:44:17,160 --> 01:44:18,470
look,
all this stuff.

2197
01:44:18,530 --> 01:44:21,950
A lot of xander's teen dial up.
Wow.

2198
01:44:23,420 --> 01:44:24,470
This is amazing.
Now.

2199
01:44:24,860 --> 01:44:27,860
It used to be just a few years ago that 
you could basically.

2200
01:44:27,861 --> 01:44:29,690
I mean I guess more than a decade ago 
now,

2201
01:44:29,691 --> 01:44:32,180
but you could basically buy steroids 
from like GNC.

2202
01:44:32,510 --> 01:44:34,700
I mean the stuff that they had was oral 
steroids.

2203
01:44:34,940 --> 01:44:36,800
Yeah.
Are there still some of these out there?

2204
01:44:36,801 --> 01:44:41,801
They've just become more designers.
Just look at the fucking list of 

2205
01:44:42,351 --> 01:44:44,360
prohibited substance in this Angel Dust 
Shit.

2206
01:44:44,990 --> 01:44:47,240
Oh my God.
Wow.

2207
01:44:47,270 --> 01:44:48,240
Okay.
Well we'll.

2208
01:44:48,241 --> 01:44:50,000
We'll leave it to anybody who wants to 
look into this.

2209
01:44:50,270 --> 01:44:51,500
I mean,
our athletes,

2210
01:44:51,501 --> 01:44:53,360
we're constantly directing them toward 
that.

2211
01:44:53,420 --> 01:44:55,250
Obviously if it's on this list,
don't take it,

2212
01:44:55,251 --> 01:44:58,490
but there's hundreds of others that 
aren't on that list.

2213
01:44:58,491 --> 01:45:00,680
They only have so much time and 
resources to buy these.

2214
01:45:00,681 --> 01:45:04,730
They they could probably hire another 
two or three phds and by these full time

2215
01:45:04,731 --> 01:45:06,890
and triple or quadruple that list.

2216
01:45:06,920 --> 01:45:07,810
That is mad.
No,

2217
01:45:07,870 --> 01:45:12,870
the industry that's crazy.
So an athlete go into a vitamin store 

2218
01:45:12,870 --> 01:45:13,070
and just buying a bunch of these things 
off the counter.

2219
01:45:13,340 --> 01:45:16,550
There's a very good possibility that 
he's going to get an actual steroids and

2220
01:45:17,030 --> 01:45:20,510
I'd be very concerned and that's where 
we pass it along to them.

2221
01:45:20,511 --> 01:45:25,511
They shouldn't be concerned.
Now the story that you told about the 

2222
01:45:25,511 --> 01:45:26,330
[inaudible] is really disturbing because
I would think that if they cleaned it at

2223
01:45:26,360 --> 01:45:28,130
all,
how would it be possible?

2224
01:45:28,140 --> 01:45:33,140
These trace amounts would get into these
people's vitamins to the point where 

2225
01:45:33,140 --> 01:45:33,800
they're getting sick from liver damage 
when it's toxic.

2226
01:45:33,810 --> 01:45:38,810
Steroids,
they obviously didn't do a good job and 

2227
01:45:38,810 --> 01:45:38,810
you know,
clean it at all.

2228
01:45:38,810 --> 01:45:39,590
It's exactly.
You know,

2229
01:45:39,591 --> 01:45:44,591
as a,
so the dietary laws in here in the 

2230
01:45:44,591 --> 01:45:46,010
United States and you know,
for foods and dietary supplements,

2231
01:45:46,011 --> 01:45:48,800
there's no premarket review of a 
product,

2232
01:45:49,100 --> 01:45:50,420
so you and I and I,
in fact,

2233
01:45:50,421 --> 01:45:52,730
I think the bells you had on last week 
as part of bigger,

2234
01:45:52,731 --> 01:45:53,540
faster,
stronger,

2235
01:45:53,541 --> 01:45:57,170
did a little piece on what the dietary 
supplement industry is.

2236
01:45:57,170 --> 01:46:02,170
And I think he hired a couple people off
the street to make supplements and 

2237
01:46:02,170 --> 01:46:02,720
showed you could put them right to the 
shop.

2238
01:46:02,750 --> 01:46:07,070
That's accurate.
So it's up to the FDA after the fact,

2239
01:46:07,880 --> 01:46:12,880
after something's already been on the 
shelf after probably somebody's already 

2240
01:46:12,880 --> 01:46:16,781
got sick or hurt,
unless you have somebody in the FDA 

2241
01:46:16,781 --> 01:46:16,940
being very proactive,
which I'll tell you,

2242
01:46:16,941 --> 01:46:18,740
coming from the FDA,
they're not proactive.

2243
01:46:18,741 --> 01:46:21,230
They're reactive agency,
um,

2244
01:46:21,231 --> 01:46:26,231
that typically either a complaint has to
be made or somebody gets hurt before 

2245
01:46:26,391 --> 01:46:29,480
they go out and you know,
enforce what the law is.

2246
01:46:29,481 --> 01:46:31,460
That product shouldn't be at the show on
the shelf.

2247
01:46:31,461 --> 01:46:34,190
They need to do a much,
much better job.

2248
01:46:34,191 --> 01:46:38,330
And especially in my position now where 
I have this group of athletes,

2249
01:46:38,331 --> 01:46:42,650
which I feel very fatherly over a,
I would call on the FDA to,

2250
01:46:42,651 --> 01:46:43,610
do,
you know,

2251
01:46:43,730 --> 01:46:47,030
a way better job than what I saw was 
happening on the inside.

2252
01:46:47,390 --> 01:46:49,740
It's a huge organization,
mostly regulatory.

2253
01:46:49,741 --> 01:46:49,980
I was

2254
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:54,980
on the criminal side,
but they have a huge population of 

2255
01:46:54,980 --> 01:46:58,311
regulatory employees that they could be 
doing a much better job in managing and 

2256
01:46:58,801 --> 01:47:00,690
uh,
and taking these products off the shelf.

2257
01:47:01,610 --> 01:47:04,770
It just seems almost like there's no way
to keep up with.

2258
01:47:04,771 --> 01:47:09,771
And if there's that,
I mean you looked at so many different 

2259
01:47:09,771 --> 01:47:12,111
supplements right there that just were 
the letter a and how many of them all 

2260
01:47:12,181 --> 01:47:14,250
told that they have on their list.
Jamie,

2261
01:47:14,251 --> 01:47:15,980
you can answer that.
How many,

2262
01:47:15,981 --> 01:47:16,800
uh,
if you say it,

2263
01:47:16,801 --> 01:47:19,980
is there a number that shows how many 
they have now?

2264
01:47:19,990 --> 01:47:21,810
These were all even just tested this 
year.

2265
01:47:22,770 --> 01:47:25,530
She's been doing that for a period of.
Oh my God,

2266
01:47:25,531 --> 01:47:27,730
that's so crazy.
Wow.

2267
01:47:28,480 --> 01:47:33,480
Cause you know,
you'd heard about that before from 

2268
01:47:33,480 --> 01:47:33,480
athletes.
We've all heard,

2269
01:47:33,480 --> 01:47:33,480
you know,
that he,

2270
01:47:33,480 --> 01:47:38,360
he took a supplement and it turned out 
to have a banned substance in it and 

2271
01:47:38,360 --> 01:47:43,161
inadvertently tested positive for 
steroids and a lot of times you think 

2272
01:47:43,161 --> 01:47:43,320
they're full of shit and that's just 
their excuse.

2273
01:47:43,320 --> 01:47:48,320
But Wow,
I'm looking at it a different way right 

2274
01:47:48,320 --> 01:47:49,980
now because of that.
It's no doubt concerning.

2275
01:47:50,700 --> 01:47:55,700
Now what about,
is it possible that one of these things 

2276
01:47:55,700 --> 01:48:00,240
like an Hvac machine or,
or altitude training,

2277
01:48:00,241 --> 01:48:05,241
or is it possible that one of those 
things will eventually be so effective 

2278
01:48:05,241 --> 01:48:06,450
that you guys are going to have to think
about banning that as well?

2279
01:48:06,780 --> 01:48:07,590
I don't know.
I mean we're,

2280
01:48:07,770 --> 01:48:11,250
we're following the law prohibited lists
and Wada prohibited methods.

2281
01:48:11,251 --> 01:48:14,100
So it ultimately would be if,
if water decided this,

2282
01:48:14,101 --> 01:48:17,370
it would fall under our program and 
actually under our program,

2283
01:48:17,630 --> 01:48:18,840
um,
you know,

2284
01:48:18,960 --> 01:48:23,190
I think we'd have the ability to 
evaluate it and determine whether or not

2285
01:48:23,191 --> 01:48:24,780
we wanted to adopt it.
We likely would,

2286
01:48:24,900 --> 01:48:27,600
I mean,
what is the gold standard and you know,

2287
01:48:27,650 --> 01:48:31,050
they're not just arbitrarily throwing 
things out there that that wouldn't give

2288
01:48:31,051 --> 01:48:34,160
someone an unfair advantage to put on 
their prohibited lists.

2289
01:48:34,160 --> 01:48:36,120
So we'd fall along likely.
Now.

2290
01:48:36,121 --> 01:48:41,121
One of the things that I really wanted 
to make sure I talked to you about 

2291
01:48:41,121 --> 01:48:42,630
because it was one that really raised my
eyebrows when we're talking in Brazil is

2292
01:48:43,080 --> 01:48:48,080
gene doping and it seems like we are at 
this very strange point when it comes to

2293
01:48:49,771 --> 01:48:53,050
technology and innovation that there 
it's.

2294
01:48:53,700 --> 01:48:58,700
I don't think they're more than a decade
away from doing something very bizarre 

2295
01:48:58,700 --> 01:49:02,601
to human bodies where it might be 
undetectable or might be so prevalent 

2296
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:06,080
that it might change the rules.
If you,

2297
01:49:06,130 --> 01:49:11,130
you're aware of crispr.
Do you know about the innovation that 

2298
01:49:11,130 --> 01:49:14,031
they created in 2012 called Crispr?
That allows them to much more 

2299
01:49:14,031 --> 01:49:18,180
efficiently manipulate genes and they're
doing it mostly,

2300
01:49:18,350 --> 01:49:22,590
you know,
they're testing it in non viable embryos

2301
01:49:22,591 --> 01:49:27,000
in China and they're doing it in all 
different animals and different things.

2302
01:49:27,001 --> 01:49:31,140
But the idea being that within a certain
amount of time,

2303
01:49:31,170 --> 01:49:36,120
it's just undoubtedly going to be 
something that they experiment with with

2304
01:49:36,121 --> 01:49:37,500
people.
In fact,

2305
01:49:37,740 --> 01:49:41,910
I have a friend who knows someone that 
was.

2306
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:47,000
They were traveling to the Middle East 
where in this one lab they were 

2307
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:48,610
performing these tests

2308
01:49:48,880 --> 01:49:52,120
where they were going to make it so that
you could determine.

2309
01:49:52,270 --> 01:49:54,160
I mean this is all.
A lot of it is.

2310
01:49:54,161 --> 01:49:57,370
I'm in the preliminary stages and a lot 
of it is,

2311
01:49:58,340 --> 01:50:01,360
it hasn't been totally proven that it's 
effective,

2312
01:50:01,690 --> 01:50:02,860
but they're gonna be able to manipulate 
it.

2313
01:50:02,861 --> 01:50:05,170
I call her think I'm going to build,
manipulate sex,

2314
01:50:05,470 --> 01:50:07,150
change the hair color,
they're gonna,

2315
01:50:07,151 --> 01:50:09,370
be able to do all sorts of different 
things to,

2316
01:50:10,060 --> 01:50:15,060
to the baby in the embryonic stage to 
change what they are as adults.

2317
01:50:15,580 --> 01:50:20,580
And the idea of creating a super athlete
through genetic manipulation is not that

2318
01:50:21,671 --> 01:50:22,240
far away.

2319
01:50:23,080 --> 01:50:24,370
It's crazy.
You know,

2320
01:50:24,560 --> 01:50:29,560
I know anti-doping when they get 
together many times during the year and 

2321
01:50:29,560 --> 01:50:31,310
have their conferences and bring 
together leading scientists.

2322
01:50:31,311 --> 01:50:33,590
It's almost always,
you know,

2323
01:50:33,591 --> 01:50:37,460
one or two hour block on where gene 
doping is going,

2324
01:50:37,461 --> 01:50:40,310
where it is now.
When was it now I don't,

2325
01:50:40,530 --> 01:50:42,980
I don't know the technicalities of where
it is now,

2326
01:50:42,981 --> 01:50:45,680
how close athletes are doing it,
but God,

2327
01:50:45,681 --> 01:50:47,540
man,
you talk about taking a risk,

2328
01:50:47,541 --> 01:50:51,020
one thing to take a drug,
but when you're manipulating your gene,

2329
01:50:51,021 --> 01:50:52,370
who knows,
you know,

2330
01:50:53,070 --> 01:50:56,120
and shoot one or two years,
what that's gonna do to you.

2331
01:50:57,470 --> 01:50:59,120
It feels like an x men movie though.
Does that?

2332
01:50:59,180 --> 01:51:00,620
It's like Jurassic Park,
you know,

2333
01:51:00,650 --> 01:51:04,010
or getting out of control real quick.
I'm mostly that happening.

2334
01:51:04,720 --> 01:51:07,830
I'm talking about Wolverine Guy Heels 
like that and saying,

2335
01:51:07,840 --> 01:51:08,680
yeah,
yeah,

2336
01:51:08,740 --> 01:51:13,740
I mean Jurassic Park Wolverine.
Although I mean I just feel like there 

2337
01:51:15,070 --> 01:51:17,560
people are gonna be the first to take 
the leap.

2338
01:51:17,680 --> 01:51:20,260
There's going to be someone or some 
government or

2339
01:51:20,300 --> 01:51:25,300
somebody who's going to be.
It's going to be the bodybuilding 

2340
01:51:25,300 --> 01:51:27,310
community and every drug that I've seen 
used in athletics,

2341
01:51:28,010 --> 01:51:29,330
performance,
anti benefits,

2342
01:51:29,360 --> 01:51:31,610
that is the community that always tries 
at first.

2343
01:51:31,910 --> 01:51:36,800
Those guys are willing to risk anything.
What does it get bigger or die trying?

2344
01:51:37,070 --> 01:51:40,320
Kind of the motto that is very common,
uh,

2345
01:51:40,730 --> 01:51:43,970
saw it firsthand.
They're willing to try and be the Guinea

2346
01:51:43,971 --> 01:51:46,490
pig for anything and they'll still get a
little bit bigger,

2347
01:51:46,580 --> 01:51:49,250
die young.
I do a lot of those guys.

2348
01:51:49,470 --> 01:51:53,540
They're usually the ones that refine how
the drugs are taken to determine,

2349
01:51:53,541 --> 01:51:54,350
hey,
this,

2350
01:51:54,950 --> 01:51:55,840
even though it's,
you know,

2351
01:51:55,880 --> 01:51:59,300
marketed or promoted for this,
actually we'll do this for you as well.

2352
01:51:59,810 --> 01:52:04,810
And saw that firsthand where non 
bodybuilding athletes would rely on 

2353
01:52:05,151 --> 01:52:08,660
advice from them of how to do it and 
what the effects were.

2354
01:52:08,990 --> 01:52:09,920
Well,
they turn over again,

2355
01:52:09,950 --> 01:52:11,540
saw that insulin,
right?

2356
01:52:11,550 --> 01:52:13,580
Yeah.
Which is super dangerous,

2357
01:52:13,581 --> 01:52:18,581
isn't it?
No doubt that make you a diabetic real 

2358
01:52:18,581 --> 01:52:18,581
quick

2359
01:52:19,940 --> 01:52:24,940
myostatin inhibitors.
That's something that I have been 

2360
01:52:24,940 --> 01:52:27,080
fascinated ever since I saw a photo of 
those whippets that have that genetic.

2361
01:52:27,310 --> 01:52:32,310
It just an aberration in the whippets 
from breeding and they've been able to 

2362
01:52:32,310 --> 01:52:35,870
manipulate cows and pigs and,
and cause it to happen now.

2363
01:52:36,230 --> 01:52:39,110
And pigs I think are the latest ones.
They've been able to do it to where they

2364
01:52:39,111 --> 01:52:44,111
have double muscle.
I've seen some of those photos and sane 

2365
01:52:44,111 --> 01:52:47,530
and they've been able to do it to mice 
and the fucked up thing about mice as 

2366
01:52:47,530 --> 01:52:50,831
they live longer,
they have doubled their lifespan I 

2367
01:52:50,831 --> 01:52:50,840
think,
and they look awesome.

2368
01:52:51,770 --> 01:52:55,280
Beach,
they look like Kevin Randleman mice.

2369
01:52:56,300 --> 01:52:57,350
I mean,
what is,

2370
01:52:57,940 --> 01:53:00,830
what's going to happen when that stuff 
makes its way into mma?

2371
01:53:00,831 --> 01:53:01,610
What do you do?

2372
01:53:01,840 --> 01:53:06,840
Yeah,
I mean my guessing an anti doping is is 

2373
01:53:06,840 --> 01:53:09,550
you're going to at some point get to 
some type of gene testing and the 

2374
01:53:09,550 --> 01:53:13,801
ability to look at human genes and see 
if they'd been manipulated,

2375
01:53:14,160 --> 01:53:15,700
manipulated or inhibited.

2376
01:53:15,820 --> 01:53:18,880
But what if someone has a natural 
manipulation?

2377
01:53:18,881 --> 01:53:22,030
Like there's a boy that was born.
I think it's been more than one person,

2378
01:53:22,031 --> 01:53:27,031
but I know of one that was born in 
Germany that has that same issue that 

2379
01:53:27,031 --> 01:53:28,990
these cows have and these whippets have.
And this young boy,

2380
01:53:29,020 --> 01:53:31,090
there he is.
Jesus fucking Christ.

2381
01:53:31,270 --> 01:53:33,310
Is that real?
That's not real.

2382
01:53:33,311 --> 01:53:34,090
Oh,
come on.

2383
01:53:34,150 --> 01:53:36,730
Is that real way to scroll up?
Scroll up.

2384
01:53:36,731 --> 01:53:41,731
Don't hold on.
How genetic engineering to make us look 

2385
01:53:41,731 --> 01:53:41,731
like.
Bodybuilders naturally it.

2386
01:53:41,731 --> 01:53:43,570
Just scroll down so it can hear what 
she.

2387
01:53:44,380 --> 01:53:49,380
In past posts.
We'll look into this because this might 

2388
01:53:49,380 --> 01:53:52,771
be bullshit because that's Chris Bell 
right there posing with that cow that's 

2389
01:53:52,771 --> 01:53:52,771
from bigger,
stronger,

2390
01:53:52,771 --> 01:53:52,771
faster.
Find.

2391
01:53:52,771 --> 01:53:57,510
Find out if.
Because I know there was a young boy 

2392
01:53:57,510 --> 01:53:58,240
looked different than that because I 
looked like a kid with an adult arm.

2393
01:53:58,750 --> 01:54:01,560
The other one looked like a kid that had
like a six pack.

2394
01:54:01,590 --> 01:54:03,040
It was.
It was really bizarre.

2395
01:54:03,041 --> 01:54:08,041
He had really thick leg muscles and and 
they were saying that this child was 

2396
01:54:08,041 --> 01:54:11,950
born without that gene.
I mean myostatin inhibitor gene and that

2397
01:54:12,490 --> 01:54:14,770
this is something that's.
It might be him.

2398
01:54:14,800 --> 01:54:16,090
Yeah.
Myostatin muscle.

2399
01:54:16,130 --> 01:54:17,290
Her looks real like,
look at that.

2400
01:54:17,291 --> 01:54:20,050
That doesn't look real.
That kid is fucking shredded.

2401
01:54:20,580 --> 01:54:21,580
Look,
get a six pack.

2402
01:54:21,850 --> 01:54:26,850
That's nonsense.
He looks like he's got a turtle shell 

2403
01:54:26,850 --> 01:54:26,850
grown out of his stomach.
Jesus Christ.

2404
01:54:27,130 --> 01:54:30,580
That kid is going to be a stud.
So what do you do with a kid like that?

2405
01:54:30,581 --> 01:54:32,200
If a kid like that,
once it compete in the UFC,

2406
01:54:32,201 --> 01:54:32,770
do you say,
no,

2407
01:54:32,771 --> 01:54:35,050
you're a mutant.
You have to compete in the x games.

2408
01:54:35,490 --> 01:54:36,300
Yeah.
I don't know.

2409
01:54:37,050 --> 01:54:42,050
I always liked seeing that,
that genetic freak of nature that comes 

2410
01:54:42,050 --> 01:54:46,221
along.
Everyone Herschel Walker or even like a 

2411
01:54:46,221 --> 01:54:49,311
babe ruth who was,
had a boiler on him that was obviously 

2412
01:54:49,311 --> 01:54:49,311
strong as hell.
So maybe one of these.

2413
01:54:49,311 --> 01:54:54,250
He's one of those,
those cool people that come along once 

2414
01:54:54,250 --> 01:54:57,051
every generation and everybody can get 
behind because I know in there knowing 

2415
01:54:57,051 --> 01:54:57,051
that that's real.

2416
01:54:57,051 --> 01:54:58,220
I Dunno.
Well it's real,

2417
01:54:58,221 --> 01:55:01,490
but it's also a genetic freak accident.
I mean,

2418
01:55:01,491 --> 01:55:04,760
he is definitely a real kid.
I mean he didn't,

2419
01:55:04,790 --> 01:55:07,760
he wasn't born as far as we know it 
wasn't created in a lab,

2420
01:55:07,790 --> 01:55:10,850
but he has some sort of a freak 
advantage.

2421
01:55:11,280 --> 01:55:16,280
Like it wasn't.
I mean Lebron James is a genetic freak 

2422
01:55:16,280 --> 01:55:16,280
accident.
Izzy.

2423
01:55:16,280 --> 01:55:16,280
I mean,
one could argue that.

2424
01:55:16,280 --> 01:55:16,500
Yeah,
no,

2425
01:55:16,501 --> 01:55:18,900
you absolutely can and you would be 
right,

2426
01:55:19,290 --> 01:55:24,290
but he's not competing and fighting.
I see that that is a little bit more 

2427
01:55:24,290 --> 01:55:24,790
extreme there.
Uh,

2428
01:55:24,810 --> 01:55:29,810
I don't know how you deal with that.
I mean obviously he's going to be able 

2429
01:55:29,810 --> 01:55:30,630
to show through medical records that 
it's been that way.

2430
01:55:30,631 --> 01:55:35,631
And all through his life and didn't just
suddenly appear when he was 16 and did 

2431
01:55:35,631 --> 01:55:40,370
manipulate his jeans.
So I mean I guess you can show that was 

2432
01:55:40,370 --> 01:55:40,370
his natural.
I don't know.

2433
01:55:40,370 --> 01:55:43,140
I don't know what the answer to that is.
It seems like a for your job,

2434
01:55:43,170 --> 01:55:48,170
it seems like there's like a window of 
time for you to enact change before all 

2435
01:55:48,170 --> 01:55:52,971
this crazy genetic shit starts rolling 
in from China and Russia and who knows 

2436
01:55:52,971 --> 01:55:53,100
where.

2437
01:55:53,460 --> 01:55:58,460
Not accusing China and Russia,
but they have been known to do some 

2438
01:55:58,460 --> 01:55:59,130
funky things in the past.
Yeah.

2439
01:55:59,131 --> 01:56:00,900
You know,
I worked at my last job,

2440
01:56:00,901 --> 01:56:05,901
I worked at the Air Mail facility at San
Francisco International Airport and part

2441
01:56:06,661 --> 01:56:11,661
of that job was to monitor everything 
coming in from China and the stuff that 

2442
01:56:12,091 --> 01:56:17,091
came through there.
And my primary focus was on drugs and 

2443
01:56:17,091 --> 01:56:20,520
raw product and compounds that we're 
putting into dietary supplements here.

2444
01:56:20,521 --> 01:56:24,570
But the majority of bad stuff going into
these supplements come in here.

2445
01:56:24,571 --> 01:56:26,370
That's where it's coming from.
From China.

2446
01:56:26,400 --> 01:56:27,070
It is,
Yep.

2447
01:56:27,540 --> 01:56:28,950
They don't have a lot of rules over 
there.

2448
01:56:29,040 --> 01:56:34,040
They don't.
And that's why it's also scary than 

2449
01:56:34,040 --> 01:56:36,171
manufacturing standards over there 
aren't good so that they'll send 

2450
01:56:36,171 --> 01:56:37,980
something over to a US manufacturer here
saying,

2451
01:56:37,981 --> 01:56:42,981
Hey,
here's what's in this product or this 

2452
01:56:42,981 --> 01:56:45,801
raw compound,
and the US manufacturers take that at 

2453
01:56:45,801 --> 01:56:47,580
its word and really not know what's 
going into his product.

2454
01:56:47,580 --> 01:56:51,030
And that's why often you see supplements
that don't have on the label.

2455
01:56:51,031 --> 01:56:56,031
What's what's really in that and it's 
not cost effective for them to test 

2456
01:56:56,031 --> 01:56:58,290
every batch and every lot that comes in.
So you see a lot of that as well.

2457
01:56:58,710 --> 01:57:01,020
Well,
I learned from the Sopranos that most of

2458
01:57:01,021 --> 01:57:06,021
the shipping containers are coming to 
the United States don't get tested and 

2459
01:57:06,021 --> 01:57:07,680
true volume that comes in,
it would be in pot,

2460
01:57:07,710 --> 01:57:12,420
you'd have to hire a million or 2 
million people to inspect everything.

2461
01:57:12,421 --> 01:57:15,360
So they target things.
I mean the intelligently target,

2462
01:57:15,870 --> 01:57:20,870
you know,
depending on what area is it comes from 

2463
01:57:20,870 --> 01:57:20,870
and what,
you know,

2464
01:57:20,870 --> 01:57:21,750
what is declared at.
But no,

2465
01:57:21,780 --> 01:57:26,700
there's the percentage of things that 
actually do get looked at and tested is,

2466
01:57:26,780 --> 01:57:29,130
is pretty low.
It's just kind of disturbing.

2467
01:57:29,780 --> 01:57:32,940
It's just,
it's amazing to consider that there's so

2468
01:57:32,941 --> 01:57:35,450
many shipping containers that are coming
in from somewhere like China,

2469
01:57:35,550 --> 01:57:38,790
China on a daily basis and who knows 
what could be possibly in them.

2470
01:57:39,030 --> 01:57:44,030
Scary now as far as like what is 
prohibited in band right now,

2471
01:57:46,410 --> 01:57:48,960
how many different things are prohibited
in band?

2472
01:57:49,560 --> 01:57:54,560
We could actually pull up.
Water's got they're prohibited list 

2473
01:57:54,560 --> 01:57:58,150
available and that's one of the cool 
things about our policy is how 

2474
01:57:58,150 --> 01:58:00,480
transparent it is.
Everything that we're doing,

2475
01:58:00,510 --> 01:58:05,510
our rules,
UFC rules are fighters can go look at 

2476
01:58:05,510 --> 01:58:07,440
their support personnel,
can look at the public and go look at.

2477
01:58:07,980 --> 01:58:10,050
They can look at the water prohibited 
lists,

2478
01:58:10,140 --> 01:58:12,960
the water prohibited method.
It's out there for everyone to see.

2479
01:58:13,680 --> 01:58:17,880
Another thing that you know,
a lot of people are surprised at this,

2480
01:58:17,881 --> 01:58:21,270
but actually when we as our testing,
we're testing now,

2481
01:58:21,271 --> 01:58:23,460
but it goes forward and starts really in
earnest.

2482
01:58:23,461 --> 01:58:28,461
You cited will start posting who's 
tested and how many times they're tested

2483
01:58:28,890 --> 01:58:33,890
by athlete name,
by the end of this year of public and 

2484
01:58:33,890 --> 01:58:37,791
pull up the USADA UFC websites who ufc 
fighter a was tested eight times UFC 

2485
01:58:38,101 --> 01:58:38,400
fighter.

2486
01:58:38,400 --> 01:58:43,400
Be They were tested three times total 
transparency and that's done.

2487
01:58:43,541 --> 01:58:48,541
Again,
to go back to what we talked about 

2488
01:58:48,541 --> 01:58:48,541
earlier,
trust and credibility of the system.

2489
01:58:48,541 --> 01:58:49,000
It's,
it's paramount.

2490
01:58:49,001 --> 01:58:52,810
It's huge for us.
For you to be able to say,

2491
01:58:53,140 --> 01:58:58,140
we're not hiding anything here.
It's all out in the open what we're 

2492
01:58:58,140 --> 01:58:58,140
doing.
So that athlete,

2493
01:58:58,140 --> 01:59:03,060
you know,
if you don't really think you know 

2494
01:59:03,060 --> 01:59:03,630
what's going on or I think this has got 
here,

2495
01:59:03,940 --> 01:59:07,330
it's all out there in the open for you.
Take a look exactly what we're doing is.

2496
01:59:07,390 --> 01:59:12,390
One of the things that people found 
disturbing about the Anderson Silva 

2497
01:59:12,390 --> 01:59:15,301
allegations was that it was revealed 
that he would never been tested outside 

2498
01:59:15,301 --> 01:59:18,520
of competition except this one time 
where we tested negative for most of our

2499
01:59:18,521 --> 01:59:21,310
athletes fall under that same 
circumstance.

2500
01:59:21,311 --> 01:59:24,850
Um,
Nevada California started doing it too.

2501
01:59:24,851 --> 01:59:29,851
It was probably the best,
I think maybe New Jersey where they 

2502
01:59:29,851 --> 01:59:31,981
would do what we call enhanced testing 
where they would maybe take the top two 

2503
01:59:31,981 --> 01:59:35,590
or three fights on a card and go out for
maybe six weeks.

2504
01:59:35,710 --> 01:59:39,970
That was the extent of any out of 
competition tests,

2505
01:59:40,290 --> 01:59:41,620
you know,
as we educate,

2506
01:59:41,650 --> 01:59:46,030
we're going out to different gyms,
we're educating the fight cards,

2507
01:59:46,140 --> 01:59:48,400
uh,
on the Wednesday before Saturday fight.

2508
01:59:48,880 --> 01:59:49,990
We usually ask the question,
hey,

2509
01:59:49,991 --> 01:59:52,080
who's been tested other than,
you know,

2510
01:59:52,090 --> 01:59:56,200
a day of competition test.
Very few hands go up,

2511
01:59:56,590 --> 01:59:58,300
you know,
maybe a couple per session.

2512
01:59:58,930 --> 02:00:00,130
So yeah,
I mean,

2513
02:00:00,131 --> 02:00:01,360
in terms of,
again,

2514
02:00:01,361 --> 02:00:03,460
understanding why an athlete will do 
something,

2515
02:00:03,461 --> 02:00:05,740
Hey,
when you're not testing anybody,

2516
02:00:06,340 --> 02:00:11,340
unless it's on the day of the fight,
which is really just an Iq test as long 

2517
02:00:11,340 --> 02:00:13,630
as you're smart enough to know how fast 
a drug a clear your system,

2518
02:00:13,631 --> 02:00:16,900
you could easily use drugs in the past 
and get off,

2519
02:00:16,901 --> 02:00:17,600
um,
you know,

2520
02:00:17,601 --> 02:00:22,601
a week or two ahead of time,
have them clear system and maintain the 

2521
02:00:22,601 --> 02:00:24,400
benefits of those drugs,
most of them through the fight.

2522
02:00:24,401 --> 02:00:26,650
So is it,
is it any surprise,

2523
02:00:27,120 --> 02:00:28,080
uh,
y,

2524
02:00:28,430 --> 02:00:33,430
you know,
especially when you're risking your 

2525
02:00:33,430 --> 02:00:34,120
health and in some arguments your life 
when you're getting in that octagon,

2526
02:00:34,121 --> 02:00:37,840
is it any surprise why a lot of athletes
have made that under really?

2527
02:00:37,840 --> 02:00:39,580
No testing in the past,
it's not to me,

2528
02:00:39,850 --> 02:00:42,580
but a guy like Anderson Silva who's 
widely considered to be,

2529
02:00:42,640 --> 02:00:47,640
if not the greatest of all time,
one of the top two or three grants of 

2530
02:00:47,640 --> 02:00:51,391
all time.
The fact that he was only tested once 

2531
02:00:51,391 --> 02:00:51,730
out of competition and failed.
That's a,

2532
02:00:51,731 --> 02:00:53,560
that's really disturbing to a lot of 
people.

2533
02:00:53,561 --> 02:00:54,170
They go,
well,

2534
02:00:54,460 --> 02:00:59,460
you know,
you're looking at these spectacular 

2535
02:00:59,460 --> 02:01:01,141
performances that he was able to have.
Who knows what he was under or on when 

2536
02:01:01,751 --> 02:01:03,790
he pulled those off.
Yeah,

2537
02:01:03,791 --> 02:01:04,810
I mean,
and not just,

2538
02:01:04,860 --> 02:01:06,670
you know,
taints the legacy.

2539
02:01:06,700 --> 02:01:08,320
Looking at him individually.
But yeah,

2540
02:01:08,321 --> 02:01:10,360
you extrapolate that out with,
you know,

2541
02:01:10,900 --> 02:01:13,190
everybody in the sport that likely,
you know,

2542
02:01:13,191 --> 02:01:18,191
if he wasn't tested out of competition,
how about the other 549 behind him if 

2543
02:01:18,611 --> 02:01:20,650
he's at the top of the game.
So you extrapolate that out.

2544
02:01:20,651 --> 02:01:21,310
It's scary.

2545
02:01:21,850 --> 02:01:23,680
Um,
so a,

2546
02:01:23,681 --> 02:01:25,480
we'll see.
We'll see real quick here.

2547
02:01:25,540 --> 02:01:29,110
I'm in.
I think a lot of it though early on is,

2548
02:01:29,111 --> 02:01:30,730
and then thank you for this platform 
today,

2549
02:01:30,731 --> 02:01:34,510
but just getting the message out,
being that deterrent effect upfront.

2550
02:01:34,980 --> 02:01:39,980
You know,
having those athletes and support look 

2551
02:01:39,980 --> 02:01:39,980
now saying,
okay,

2552
02:01:39,980 --> 02:01:41,120
the game's changed now.
It's no longer,

2553
02:01:41,121 --> 02:01:43,610
you're not going to be tested.
You don't trust that your opponents.

2554
02:01:43,910 --> 02:01:48,230
Now the game's changed that they're 
using every method and tool available.

2555
02:01:48,500 --> 02:01:52,430
They're using blood,
urine testing for specific drugs.

2556
02:01:52,610 --> 02:01:54,710
They're looking at a biological 
passport.

2557
02:01:54,711 --> 02:01:57,650
So if a specific drug doesn't show up,
they could catch somebody that way.

2558
02:01:57,651 --> 02:02:02,651
Hell,
they're freezing our blood and urine 

2559
02:02:02,651 --> 02:02:04,780
that if the test isn't available today 
and maybe in a year or two and they'll 

2560
02:02:04,780 --> 02:02:05,660
go back and test that and then maybe if 
I'm not fighting,

2561
02:02:05,750 --> 02:02:07,550
my legacy is,
is done.

2562
02:02:08,210 --> 02:02:13,210
Hopefully everybody's hearing all these 
things that we're doing a hearing me 

2563
02:02:13,210 --> 02:02:16,451
talk about experiences I've had with 
athletes in the past about how damn 

2564
02:02:16,451 --> 02:02:20,711
stressful it's going to be for a UFC 
athlete right now to use drugs and get 

2565
02:02:20,711 --> 02:02:20,711
away with it.

2566
02:02:21,200 --> 02:02:23,990
They are going to be thinking about that
24 slash seven.

2567
02:02:23,991 --> 02:02:26,390
I guarantee you a shit who's coming 
tomorrow.

2568
02:02:26,410 --> 02:02:31,410
Okay,
how long do I got for this clears my 

2569
02:02:31,410 --> 02:02:31,410
system?
Can I trust the person that's telling me

2570
02:02:31,410 --> 02:02:33,920
that all this shit's going to be 
happening from now out in the hope would

2571
02:02:33,921 --> 02:02:38,570
be being that determine up front,
so the decisions made on the front end.

2572
02:02:38,571 --> 02:02:43,571
Okay.
It wasn't something that we can do now 

2573
02:02:43,571 --> 02:02:44,420
as opposed to all of a sudden dozens of 
positive tests on the back end.

2574
02:02:44,421 --> 02:02:49,421
The hope is I can get out and do a good 
enough job of expressing how serious is 

2575
02:02:49,421 --> 02:02:52,010
going to be that that our population of 
fighter here that

2576
02:02:52,640 --> 02:02:57,640
now.
What about the difference between in 

2577
02:02:57,640 --> 02:02:59,560
competition and the competition testing 
and as far as like what the penalties 

2578
02:02:59,631 --> 02:03:04,631
are for added competition testing and 
what about recreational drugs in 

2579
02:03:04,631 --> 02:03:05,990
competition?
Not a competition.

2580
02:03:05,991 --> 02:03:10,991
Testing like John Jones tested positive 
for cocaine and it was out of 

2581
02:03:10,991 --> 02:03:13,130
competition so he was still allowed to 
compete in.

2582
02:03:13,131 --> 02:03:18,131
A lot of people were kind of critical of
that and like how is that possible that 

2583
02:03:18,131 --> 02:03:20,330
you tested guy?
He tests positive for a banned substance

2584
02:03:20,450 --> 02:03:22,670
and yet he still allowed to compete.
You don't even hear about it,

2585
02:03:22,671 --> 02:03:26,660
but the results were known before he 
fought and they never went public.

2586
02:03:27,100 --> 02:03:28,870
Yeah,
I mean a lot of different issues there.

2587
02:03:28,871 --> 02:03:32,020
So let me one at a time.
So first our UFC policy,

2588
02:03:32,380 --> 02:03:36,310
so out of competition,
the test for out of competition drugs,

2589
02:03:36,311 --> 02:03:41,311
those drugs are,
those substances will be your hard 

2590
02:03:41,311 --> 02:03:41,311
substances,
your anabolic steroids,

2591
02:03:41,311 --> 02:03:44,080
your human growth hormones,
your blood doping type drugs,

2592
02:03:44,640 --> 02:03:49,640
those are tested for both out and in.
And those are tested 365 days a year in 

2593
02:03:49,781 --> 02:03:54,781
competition.
And the definition of in competition 

2594
02:03:54,781 --> 02:03:54,781
under our policy is six hours before the
weigh,

2595
02:03:54,781 --> 02:03:59,020
in to six hours after the fight.
During that period of time,

2596
02:03:59,470 --> 02:04:03,310
the drugs tested will be your drugs,
recreational drugs,

2597
02:04:03,311 --> 02:04:06,160
marijuana stimulants,
including cocaine,

2598
02:04:07,180 --> 02:04:09,040
other drugs.
So there's only really a,

2599
02:04:09,340 --> 02:04:14,340
you know,
a 48 hour so window that those will be 

2600
02:04:14,340 --> 02:04:16,540
tested for those recreational drugs are 
not tested for at a competition.

2601
02:04:16,930 --> 02:04:21,250
And the John Jones situation that was in
Nevada State Athletic Commission test,

2602
02:04:21,400 --> 02:04:23,620
uh,
they have the same rules at the time.

2603
02:04:23,620 --> 02:04:26,890
Drugs of abuse were to be tested for 
only in competition.

2604
02:04:27,430 --> 02:04:30,040
My understand drugs of abuse,
you mean recreational drugs?

2605
02:04:30,041 --> 02:04:31,110
Racial drugs.
Sorry.

2606
02:04:31,120 --> 02:04:32,860
Yeah.
Some.

2607
02:04:32,861 --> 02:04:37,861
My understanding is somebody made a 
mistake and check the box to do 

2608
02:04:37,861 --> 02:04:40,560
recreational drugs and an attic 
competition collection.

2609
02:04:40,950 --> 02:04:45,950
Oh,
so he wasn't supposed to be tested for 

2610
02:04:45,950 --> 02:04:45,950
cocaine?
Correct.

2611
02:04:45,950 --> 02:04:45,950
Dave,
you know,

2612
02:04:45,950 --> 02:04:48,240
their policy was not to test for 
cocaine,

2613
02:04:48,241 --> 02:04:50,520
marijuana,
they're stimulants out of competition.

2614
02:04:50,730 --> 02:04:55,410
It was a mistake of checking a box.
So when it turns out positive,

2615
02:04:55,500 --> 02:05:00,500
he's not punished for it because they 
weren't supposed to test for it in the 

2616
02:05:00,500 --> 02:05:00,500
first place.
That's my understanding.

2617
02:05:00,500 --> 02:05:00,500
Yep.
Okay.

2618
02:05:00,980 --> 02:05:01,920
Um,
you know,

2619
02:05:02,010 --> 02:05:07,010
it's unfortunate.
I don't like when any mistakes are made 

2620
02:05:07,010 --> 02:05:07,010
like that.
I think,

2621
02:05:07,010 --> 02:05:07,710
you know,
even though it was Nevada state athletic

2622
02:05:07,711 --> 02:05:10,770
commission,
it taints the entire anti-doping,

2623
02:05:11,280 --> 02:05:12,180
you know,
arena.

2624
02:05:12,181 --> 02:05:17,181
I think anti-doping needs to be almost 
perfect because again,

2625
02:05:17,581 --> 02:05:20,610
going back to that trust and credibility
factor,

2626
02:05:21,090 --> 02:05:26,090
regardless of who's doing it,
when they make mistakes and anti-doping 

2627
02:05:26,090 --> 02:05:26,090
like a false positive.

2628
02:05:26,090 --> 02:05:26,220
I mean,
to me,

2629
02:05:26,221 --> 02:05:31,020
a false positive could never happened 
because no one would ever trust anything

2630
02:05:31,021 --> 02:05:33,520
that's going on for a,
you know,

2631
02:05:33,690 --> 02:05:38,690
mistakes like that,
collection errors where the collectors 

2632
02:05:38,690 --> 02:05:43,161
aren't going observing.
If you have holes in the system and it 

2633
02:05:43,161 --> 02:05:43,260
gets out,
does it matter who's doing it?

2634
02:05:43,261 --> 02:05:48,261
I think it taints all of anti-doping and
so that's one of the reasons we went to 

2635
02:05:48,261 --> 02:05:50,940
Usada is these guys have been in the 
business longer than anybody else.

2636
02:05:51,360 --> 02:05:56,360
They're known as kind of the gold 
standard entity and all the world they 

2637
02:05:56,491 --> 02:05:59,280
are in that business.
They've been doing it for 15 years.

2638
02:05:59,281 --> 02:06:03,390
They know what all the pitfalls are and 
they expect themselves to be perfect and

2639
02:06:03,560 --> 02:06:07,830
I think that's huge to lend that 
credibility and trust to our athletes.

2640
02:06:08,400 --> 02:06:13,320
Nevada recently changed its levels of 
acceptable use of marijuana.

2641
02:06:13,440 --> 02:06:16,710
They changed the levels of acceptable 
and metabolites in the system.

2642
02:06:17,040 --> 02:06:20,040
What is it at now and what you were 
discussing with me in Brazil,

2643
02:06:20,041 --> 02:06:25,041
you were saying that you essentially 
would have to fight high in order to 

2644
02:06:25,041 --> 02:06:25,041
test positive.
Yeah,

2645
02:06:25,041 --> 02:06:29,810
likely.
So Nevada adopted in terms of marijuana 

2646
02:06:29,810 --> 02:06:33,291
with the water standard was,
and that's 150 nanograms per milliliter 

2647
02:06:33,860 --> 02:06:38,860
a,
it probably doesn't mean much to most 

2648
02:06:38,860 --> 02:06:38,910
people.
But to give you some perspective,

2649
02:06:38,911 --> 02:06:42,360
it used to be 15 nanograms per 
milliliter.

2650
02:06:42,810 --> 02:06:45,330
So they've increased it 10 times,
10 times.

2651
02:06:45,360 --> 02:06:46,950
Exactly.
Um,

2652
02:06:47,460 --> 02:06:49,440
so you'd have to be under the influence 
while you're fighting.

2653
02:06:50,070 --> 02:06:52,350
It's tough because that's,
as we're out educating,

2654
02:06:52,440 --> 02:06:54,780
the next question we get is,
hey,

2655
02:06:54,870 --> 02:06:56,760
how long would I,
if I was a chronic smoker,

2656
02:06:56,761 --> 02:07:01,290
how long would it have to be off it?
It's tough to say each individual varies

2657
02:07:01,291 --> 02:07:06,291
in terms of how they metabolize the fat 
content on your body may store it 

2658
02:07:06,291 --> 02:07:09,921
longer.
So we can't give our athletes guidance 

2659
02:07:09,921 --> 02:07:09,921
like,
hey,

2660
02:07:09,921 --> 02:07:11,790
if you do it a week out or two days out,
you're fine.

2661
02:07:12,260 --> 02:07:17,260
I'm the only thing we can give them is 
just kind of what statistics have borne 

2662
02:07:17,260 --> 02:07:18,070
out.
Um,

2663
02:07:18,270 --> 02:07:21,330
you sought as tested all their Olympic 
athletes.

2664
02:07:22,140 --> 02:07:27,140
Thousands now under this standard of 150
milligrams per milliliter over the last 

2665
02:07:28,410 --> 02:07:31,080
couple of years.
They've had very few positive tests.

2666
02:07:31,081 --> 02:07:32,280
Maybe,
you know,

2667
02:07:32,850 --> 02:07:35,550
a couple.
Then along comes Nick Diaz

2668
02:07:37,650 --> 02:07:41,500
was under 150 nanogram per milliliter.
Stays at that point he was under,

2669
02:07:41,980 --> 02:07:44,200
but he's still tested positive.
He was over.

2670
02:07:44,201 --> 02:07:46,090
That was over when,
I mean Andrea,

2671
02:07:46,091 --> 02:07:47,440
he fell under.
Oh,

2672
02:07:47,441 --> 02:07:48,880
that standard.
So what was,

2673
02:07:48,910 --> 02:07:51,640
what was his test results?
I don't know specifically what it was.

2674
02:07:51,641 --> 02:07:53,560
Other than that,
it would have been over 150.

2675
02:07:53,561 --> 02:07:57,880
So he essentially fought high.
Probably respect.

2676
02:07:59,710 --> 02:08:01,990
Imagine that you're not just fighting 
Anderson Silva.

2677
02:08:01,991 --> 02:08:05,260
You fighting them while you're stoned.
Damn.

2678
02:08:05,930 --> 02:08:09,040
Nick Diaz is a beast.
I mean,

2679
02:08:09,070 --> 02:08:13,000
I don't advise it,
but I respect it kinda crazy though,

2680
02:08:13,001 --> 02:08:18,001
right?
That he could a fight in the UFC in the 

2681
02:08:18,001 --> 02:08:18,001
main event like that.
Yeah.

2682
02:08:18,001 --> 02:08:18,670
I don't know.
I was uh,

2683
02:08:18,730 --> 02:08:21,530
I was a basketball player in college 
basketball player and uh,

2684
02:08:21,840 --> 02:08:22,840
you know,
when I played,

2685
02:08:23,380 --> 02:08:26,620
I had guys on my team that will get 
stone before practice.

2686
02:08:27,230 --> 02:08:30,070
I'm dominate practice.
Yeah.

2687
02:08:30,070 --> 02:08:32,870
People love it.
A Jujitsu to Jujitsu.

2688
02:08:32,890 --> 02:08:37,890
It's a huge part of the Jujitsu world.
So many guys like you go to a lot of 

2689
02:08:37,890 --> 02:08:38,590
Jujitsu schools and you'll see the 
parking lot before,

2690
02:08:38,591 --> 02:08:40,540
but he goes into train.
Guys are smoking pot.

2691
02:08:40,900 --> 02:08:45,900
It's very,
very common because they feel like it 

2692
02:08:45,900 --> 02:08:47,700
puts them in a zone.
My own personal experience I feel like 

2693
02:08:47,700 --> 02:08:48,010
it does puts me in a,
in a zone.

2694
02:08:48,011 --> 02:08:53,011
It makes me understand the techniques 
better because you look more of a 

2695
02:08:53,011 --> 02:08:53,011
sensitivity to training.
Well,

2696
02:08:53,011 --> 02:08:57,511
how about in the MMA world because 
you're worried about so many different 

2697
02:08:57,511 --> 02:09:00,961
things.
A strike a take that you got so many 

2698
02:09:00,961 --> 02:09:00,961
things to worry about.
I mean,

2699
02:09:00,961 --> 02:09:04,641
do you find that you're focusing in on 
this one thing and you're not paying 

2700
02:09:04,641 --> 02:09:04,641
attention to?
No,

2701
02:09:04,641 --> 02:09:04,870
no,
no,

2702
02:09:04,871 --> 02:09:05,320
no,
no,

2703
02:09:05,321 --> 02:09:07,210
no.
Unless you're not ready.

2704
02:09:07,360 --> 02:09:07,690
This is.
Yeah.

2705
02:09:07,710 --> 02:09:07,860
What

2706
02:09:07,860 --> 02:09:12,860
I find,
I find that it's not that good for 

2707
02:09:12,860 --> 02:09:15,591
learning things.
I find that when you're learning 

2708
02:09:15,591 --> 02:09:18,441
something,
especially like if you're drilling 

2709
02:09:18,441 --> 02:09:19,680
something,
I find drilling is better done sober.

2710
02:09:19,830 --> 02:09:21,840
Like I'm better off at learning things 
sober,

2711
02:09:21,841 --> 02:09:25,050
but once something is committed to my 
nervous system,

2712
02:09:25,051 --> 02:09:28,440
once I understand how to do the move,
like there's certain positions,

2713
02:09:28,670 --> 02:09:32,910
there are certain positions that did 
just fall into the way a Eddie Bravo is,

2714
02:09:32,911 --> 02:09:34,890
describes it best.
I love this analogy.

2715
02:09:34,891 --> 02:09:36,420
It's like,
you know when you tie your shoes,

2716
02:09:36,421 --> 02:09:41,421
you don't even think about it.
You just wish you just tie your shoes 

2717
02:09:41,421 --> 02:09:44,001
because you've tied your shoes every day
for your whole life and it just becomes 

2718
02:09:44,001 --> 02:09:46,941
natural.
There are certain positions where you 

2719
02:09:46,941 --> 02:09:48,771
find yourself sinking into submission.
You don't even know what's happening 

2720
02:09:48,771 --> 02:09:52,641
until you've done it because you've done
it so many times in drills that it just 

2721
02:09:52,641 --> 02:09:52,740
becomes automatic.

2722
02:09:52,740 --> 02:09:56,850
Those are enhanced by marijuana,
but the learning part,

2723
02:09:56,910 --> 02:10:00,780
I feel like sometimes you don't get all 
the finer details,

2724
02:10:00,781 --> 02:10:02,590
but maybe that's me.
Yeah.

2725
02:10:02,650 --> 02:10:07,650
I think there's also the possibility 
that everybody has their own different 

2726
02:10:07,650 --> 02:10:10,850
way of experiencing marijuana.
The biodiversity aspect of human beings.

2727
02:10:12,270 --> 02:10:14,550
It's.
Some people just don't like it at all.

2728
02:10:14,760 --> 02:10:17,090
I have friends that just can't do it.
They'll smoke a little pot and like,

2729
02:10:17,100 --> 02:10:18,490
fuck.
They just hate,

2730
02:10:18,491 --> 02:10:21,030
it freaks them out,
they don't like doing anything on it.

2731
02:10:21,210 --> 02:10:23,400
And then other people,
they like doing everything on it.

2732
02:10:23,760 --> 02:10:27,210
So I don't know.
I don't know what other folks feel,

2733
02:10:27,240 --> 02:10:30,750
but for me I feel like I learn things 
better when I'm not high,

2734
02:10:31,200 --> 02:10:34,310
but I feel like once I'm,
once I understand

2735
02:10:34,310 --> 02:10:35,500
something,
it just become,

2736
02:10:35,920 --> 02:10:40,920
it's like a second nature thing,
then I feel like I'm more tuned in if 

2737
02:10:40,920 --> 02:10:45,401
that makes any sense.
That's interesting because there's the 

2738
02:10:45,401 --> 02:10:45,410
argument out there from a lot like why 
is that even band?

2739
02:10:45,411 --> 02:10:48,110
That's not.
How is marijuana performance enhancing?

2740
02:10:48,111 --> 02:10:49,730
So it's interesting to hear you say 
that.

2741
02:10:49,760 --> 02:10:52,100
I think it can be a performance 
enhancing drug.

2742
02:10:52,101 --> 02:10:53,190
I really do.
Oh,

2743
02:10:53,200 --> 02:10:58,200
how bout,
how bout deadening pits obviously used 

2744
02:10:58,200 --> 02:10:58,330
for pain relief.
So what do you think about it?

2745
02:10:58,340 --> 02:11:00,050
Could mask pain?
Certainly could.

2746
02:11:00,110 --> 02:11:02,690
It's certainly possible.
It's definitely not even,

2747
02:11:02,720 --> 02:11:04,220
it's not baseline.
You're not,

2748
02:11:04,460 --> 02:11:06,270
you're not sober.
So the,

2749
02:11:06,280 --> 02:11:11,280
the idea that anything that you could 
use that could possibly give you an 

2750
02:11:11,280 --> 02:11:13,100
advantage,
I just know it gives you an advantage.

2751
02:11:13,140 --> 02:11:14,990
Uses Jujitsu.
I know it does.

2752
02:11:15,290 --> 02:11:20,290
I know so many guys use it,
so many guys roll with it like big name 

2753
02:11:20,290 --> 02:11:21,860
guys that that are high level Jujitsu 
competitors.

2754
02:11:22,070 --> 02:11:27,070
They train high every time and they love
it and I just think you can't ignore 

2755
02:11:27,070 --> 02:11:31,601
that.
I think that it's quite possible that 

2756
02:11:31,601 --> 02:11:33,380
there's an advantage to using it and 
then the pain relief aspect of it.

2757
02:11:33,650 --> 02:11:38,650
Look,
you can't fight on pain pills or and if 

2758
02:11:38,650 --> 02:11:38,650
you,
if there was a pain blocker that allowed

2759
02:11:38,650 --> 02:11:43,631
you to not feel impacts of strikes and 
he just went out there and fought and 

2760
02:11:43,631 --> 02:11:44,720
dealt with the consequences tomorrow 
when it wore off,

2761
02:11:44,990 --> 02:11:47,420
that would be illegal for sure.
Well,

2762
02:11:47,930 --> 02:11:51,740
marijuana is absolutely used to help 
people with pain management.

2763
02:11:51,980 --> 02:11:56,980
Absolutely.
So I don't think it should be legal to 

2764
02:11:56,980 --> 02:11:56,980
compete with.
I just think I.

2765
02:11:56,980 --> 02:12:01,511
I think there's too many possibilities.
I also don't think a lot of testing has 

2766
02:12:01,511 --> 02:12:04,220
been done on the performance enhancing 
aspects of marijuana,

2767
02:12:04,430 --> 02:12:08,900
but what has been revealed recently is 
the benefits that ultra marathon runners

2768
02:12:08,901 --> 02:12:13,901
experience with and marijuana that they 
can push through better put their mind 

2769
02:12:13,901 --> 02:12:14,300
in a different place and not.

2770
02:12:14,600 --> 02:12:19,600
Yeah.
I took this on the hours and hours of 

2771
02:12:19,600 --> 02:12:19,910
monotony and I don't think you can 
ignore that.

2772
02:12:19,970 --> 02:12:20,400
I think,
uh,

2773
02:12:20,440 --> 02:12:24,860
I think that's certainly something that 
should be considered and if you're going

2774
02:12:24,861 --> 02:12:27,980
to ban a lot of different things,
obviously I liked marijuana.

2775
02:12:27,981 --> 02:12:30,870
I'm an enthusiastic,
but I think that there's,

2776
02:12:31,030 --> 02:12:36,030
there's absolutely potential that it 
could be a performance enhancing drug 

2777
02:12:36,030 --> 02:12:38,720
and a lot of ways I was people mocked me
on that for a long time,

2778
02:12:38,721 --> 02:12:41,000
but now that this,
these new studies are coming out,

2779
02:12:41,001 --> 02:12:43,040
especially with a ultra marathon 
runners,

2780
02:12:43,041 --> 02:12:46,490
I feel vindicated.
I feel vindicated for you.

2781
02:12:46,610 --> 02:12:47,420
Thank you.
Um,

2782
02:12:47,540 --> 02:12:51,350
is there anything else we should cover?
We pretty much nailed almost everything,

2783
02:12:51,710 --> 02:12:54,590
the comprehensive aspect of the drug 
testing policy.

2784
02:12:54,830 --> 02:12:56,100
The randomness,
uh,

2785
02:12:56,101 --> 02:13:00,220
I believe the top athletes are going to 
be tested five times a year randomly.

2786
02:13:00,240 --> 02:13:00,830
So it's going.
I,

2787
02:13:00,890 --> 02:13:02,720
that's,
I think if you look the average with our

2788
02:13:02,721 --> 02:13:07,721
population versus how many tests that 
were contracted to do or that you saw 

2789
02:13:07,721 --> 02:13:08,740
this contractor to do with us,
um,

2790
02:13:08,930 --> 02:13:10,040
it'll average to that.

2791
02:13:10,040 --> 02:13:10,910
But you know,
again,

2792
02:13:10,970 --> 02:13:14,000
everybody will be able to go on and see 
starting soon here,

2793
02:13:14,420 --> 02:13:16,280
who's tested by name,
how many times,

2794
02:13:16,281 --> 02:13:18,110
and you're not going to see across the 
board,

2795
02:13:18,111 --> 02:13:22,070
five for everybody.
Likely you're going to see 10 or a dozen

2796
02:13:22,071 --> 02:13:23,780
per year for some people.
Really.

2797
02:13:23,810 --> 02:13:26,080
Maybe two or three.
And is there a.

2798
02:13:26,420 --> 02:13:28,100
sorry,
it's not random testing.

2799
02:13:28,160 --> 02:13:31,620
It's intelligent testing.
You saw it as not going to say hey,

2800
02:13:31,621 --> 02:13:33,510
we're going to roll the dice and whoever
comes up,

2801
02:13:33,540 --> 02:13:37,020
they're going to look at everything from
tips they may get.

2802
02:13:37,710 --> 02:13:41,070
How they'll even look at physical 
appearances of athletes.

2803
02:13:41,520 --> 02:13:46,520
You know,
does this athlete pass kind of the 

2804
02:13:46,520 --> 02:13:46,520
physical appearance,
smell tests?

2805
02:13:46,520 --> 02:13:51,231
And if they don't,
hey maybe we need to test that person a 

2806
02:13:51,231 --> 02:13:51,231
little bit more.
Physical appearance,

2807
02:13:51,231 --> 02:13:51,231
smell,
test.

2808
02:13:52,050 --> 02:13:52,940
Really.
So like,

2809
02:13:53,250 --> 02:13:55,200
like what would you like?
You look at a guy and you go,

2810
02:13:55,201 --> 02:13:56,860
man,
that guy just looks juiced.

2811
02:13:57,030 --> 02:13:57,960
He looks different.
One,

2812
02:13:57,990 --> 02:13:59,160
you've seen it.
Yeah,

2813
02:13:59,161 --> 02:14:00,330
but I don't know man.
I mean,

2814
02:14:00,331 --> 02:14:05,331
I've seen it on guys that have tested 
negative and I've seen guys that have 

2815
02:14:05,331 --> 02:14:06,660
been accused of things,
but they've tested negative every time.

2816
02:14:06,690 --> 02:14:08,610
I agree.
I agree with Dos Anjos,

2817
02:14:08,870 --> 02:14:12,240
heartfelt dos Anjos was a UFC 
lightweight champion when he beat Pettis

2818
02:14:12,241 --> 02:14:14,250
and he beat Pettis in such a convincing 
way.

2819
02:14:14,610 --> 02:14:19,610
Boy,
there were so many people accusing that 

2820
02:14:19,610 --> 02:14:19,610
guy and being on performance enhancing 
drugs.

2821
02:14:19,610 --> 02:14:23,130
But if you look at his body over the 
years really hasn't varied that much,

2822
02:14:23,450 --> 02:14:25,410
a little bit from the first time he was 
in the UFC,

2823
02:14:25,411 --> 02:14:30,411
but that was before he was on 
comprehensive strength and conditioning 

2824
02:14:30,411 --> 02:14:33,021
program.
You look at him like over the last few 

2825
02:14:33,021 --> 02:14:33,030
years,
he's pretty consistent,

2826
02:14:33,360 --> 02:14:38,360
but yet once he wins the title,
everybody starts pointing fingers at 

2827
02:14:38,360 --> 02:14:41,751
them.
And if you look at him like pull up a 

2828
02:14:41,751 --> 02:14:43,731
picture of a Hoffeld dos Anjos UFC 
lightweight champion of the world,

2829
02:14:44,150 --> 02:14:49,150
uh,
when he is fighting and when he's in 

2830
02:14:49,150 --> 02:14:49,150
shape and he's fit.

2831
02:14:49,150 --> 02:14:49,150
Yeah.
He looks like,

2832
02:14:49,530 --> 02:14:52,440
like I would like to look like if you 
were on steroids,

2833
02:14:52,650 --> 02:14:57,650
I would say that people would take 
steroids if they could look like this 

2834
02:14:57,650 --> 02:14:58,350
guy.
Does he pass the smell test?

2835
02:15:00,060 --> 02:15:05,060
Like see,
see if you could find a picture of him 

2836
02:15:05,060 --> 02:15:08,390
where he's just looked jacked.
So there's a picture of him over in the 

2837
02:15:08,390 --> 02:15:09,900
far left up there.
That's him after he beat Pettis.

2838
02:15:10,260 --> 02:15:11,220
But look there,
there's like,

2839
02:15:11,340 --> 02:15:12,750
no,
that looks just like an athlete,

2840
02:15:12,751 --> 02:15:14,910
but that looks okay.
That's a perfect one.

2841
02:15:15,360 --> 02:15:19,770
That's him.
When he was fighting pedes I believe.

2842
02:15:19,860 --> 02:15:22,600
Is that from the same fight?
Okay.

2843
02:15:23,010 --> 02:15:26,640
Look at that.
He's fucking shredded.

2844
02:15:27,020 --> 02:15:29,790
His six pack has a six pack.
I mean,

2845
02:15:30,630 --> 02:15:34,980
but not much different physically other 
than like a little bit less body fat.

2846
02:15:35,140 --> 02:15:37,380
I mean he's a fucking Stud,
you know?

2847
02:15:37,410 --> 02:15:38,490
I mean that's why he's the champ.

2848
02:15:39,030 --> 02:15:41,910
Obviously there's a lot of hard work 
that goes into that,

2849
02:15:41,911 --> 02:15:43,800
but when people look at him,
you know,

2850
02:15:43,801 --> 02:15:44,760
you say,
well,

2851
02:15:45,660 --> 02:15:48,870
that looks like a guy who,
if,

2852
02:15:48,930 --> 02:15:53,930
if someone didn't look like that and 
then they took something and look like 

2853
02:15:53,930 --> 02:15:53,930
that,
you would say,

2854
02:15:53,930 --> 02:15:55,650
well then the guys on steroids.
But if he always looks like that,

2855
02:15:56,550 --> 02:15:57,620
it's hard.
It's hard to.

2856
02:15:57,680 --> 02:16:00,150
I different.
There's outliers,

2857
02:16:00,180 --> 02:16:01,530
uh,
you know,

2858
02:16:02,130 --> 02:16:07,130
over those,
that 15 year law enforcement career I 

2859
02:16:07,130 --> 02:16:07,130
had involved with all of these cases.
I mean,

2860
02:16:07,130 --> 02:16:10,380
I knew of many athletes who look like 
they did,

2861
02:16:10,381 --> 02:16:13,200
who didn't release no evidence appeared 
of it.

2862
02:16:13,230 --> 02:16:16,080
Many who didn't look like they did,
did.

2863
02:16:16,680 --> 02:16:18,390
Uh,
this is strictly,

2864
02:16:18,660 --> 02:16:20,970
you know,
another tool to be used.

2865
02:16:20,971 --> 02:16:22,590
It doesn't mean all the time that,
you know,

2866
02:16:22,591 --> 02:16:26,190
an athlete that doesn't pass the smell 
test will test positive.

2867
02:16:26,191 --> 02:16:28,910
But a lot of the times it does,
is,

2868
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:29,320
it,
means,

2869
02:16:29,321 --> 02:16:30,190
is a test doesn't

2870
02:16:30,190 --> 02:16:33,760
mean that person's all your positive 
because you look like you did.

2871
02:16:33,761 --> 02:16:34,300
It's like,
hey,

2872
02:16:34,301 --> 02:16:37,330
you may be an extra test or two.
And if I was at athlete,

2873
02:16:37,540 --> 02:16:39,250
that was that freak,
I'd say,

2874
02:16:39,251 --> 02:16:44,251
Hey,
yeah man touched me more because people 

2875
02:16:44,251 --> 02:16:44,251
were accusing me of it.
So that'll be cool.

2876
02:16:44,251 --> 02:16:48,361
At the end of the year,
everybody will look at my stats on the 

2877
02:16:48,361 --> 02:16:50,080
webpage and see I was tested 10 times 
and no positive test for me here.

2878
02:16:50,081 --> 02:16:55,081
So I'm hoping a lot of this is,
it's going to be,

2879
02:16:55,460 --> 02:16:57,520
you know,
in terms of the whereabouts program,

2880
02:16:57,521 --> 02:16:59,140
the amount of tests are athletes 
getting,

2881
02:16:59,141 --> 02:17:04,141
it's going to be an inconvenience.
But I'm hoping that there's a lot of 

2882
02:17:04,141 --> 02:17:06,190
acceptance and embracement of it that 
like hell yeah,

2883
02:17:06,460 --> 02:17:09,460
not only is this the baddest sport in 
the world were the toughest dude,

2884
02:17:09,461 --> 02:17:12,640
but we have the toughest anti-doping 
program and bring it on.

2885
02:17:13,270 --> 02:17:16,570
I'm hoping that there's a lot of that in
the sentiment that I get is as we go out

2886
02:17:16,571 --> 02:17:18,930
and talk is a lot of that.
Um,

2887
02:17:18,940 --> 02:17:20,470
maybe it's lip service,
I don't know.

2888
02:17:20,471 --> 02:17:21,550
But,
um,

2889
02:17:21,551 --> 02:17:23,230
I would like to think that,
you know,

2890
02:17:23,420 --> 02:17:25,560
little certainly become that.
If it's not that right now,

2891
02:17:25,561 --> 02:17:30,561
it will certainly become that.
Is there any potential for manipulation 

2892
02:17:30,561 --> 02:17:33,760
by opponents calling into hotlines,
accusing someone of something and having

2893
02:17:33,761 --> 02:17:35,980
them task,
giving false information,

2894
02:17:36,670 --> 02:17:38,200
false tips.
Sure.

2895
02:17:38,201 --> 02:17:40,450
There always is.
I can see her doing that.

2896
02:17:40,540 --> 02:17:43,690
I dealt with that all the time.
And in law enforcement,

2897
02:17:43,691 --> 02:17:44,530
right?
First Time,

2898
02:17:44,590 --> 02:17:47,470
first thing a tip comes in,
you have to evaluate who is this person?

2899
02:17:47,471 --> 02:17:50,020
Are they an x wide for an ex husband?
Okay.

2900
02:17:50,290 --> 02:17:51,580
Hey,
are they being sued by this?

2901
02:17:51,581 --> 02:17:54,040
You know,
evaluate that and you it do that too.

2902
02:17:54,630 --> 02:17:57,010
Um,
so does someone have to say who they are

2903
02:17:57,011 --> 02:17:59,040
when they give a tip or can they leave 
anonymous today?

2904
02:17:59,050 --> 02:18:01,420
Can leave it anonymously.
Funnels conor Mcgregor.

2905
02:18:01,421 --> 02:18:03,880
I'd be calling that although hotline old
day.

2906
02:18:03,881 --> 02:18:06,160
I bet he just to fuck with them.
You know,

2907
02:18:06,700 --> 02:18:08,200
it's got to be guys that are going to do
that.

2908
02:18:08,201 --> 02:18:09,880
Right?
The brogue might give it away.

2909
02:18:09,881 --> 02:18:10,870
I don't know.
Yeah,

2910
02:18:10,871 --> 02:18:11,450
right.
Uh,

2911
02:18:11,850 --> 02:18:16,850
is full.
Can shape but a guy like like say dose 

2912
02:18:16,850 --> 02:18:17,560
on Joe's,
you know,

2913
02:18:17,770 --> 02:18:22,770
like who has that appearance just looks 
absolutely shredded and is beating 

2914
02:18:23,531 --> 02:18:28,531
everybody is automatically going to be 
people that point fingers at a guy like 

2915
02:18:28,531 --> 02:18:28,531
that.
Right?

2916
02:18:28,531 --> 02:18:29,050
Potentially.
Sure.

2917
02:18:29,620 --> 02:18:34,460
Is there any other type of testing that 
they're working on on,

2918
02:18:34,840 --> 02:18:39,840
on the pipeline that may perhaps be even
more effective than what they're doing 

2919
02:18:39,840 --> 02:18:39,840
now?
Oh sure.

2920
02:18:39,990 --> 02:18:40,540
Yeah,
sure.

2921
02:18:40,541 --> 02:18:41,110
I mean,
again,

2922
02:18:41,111 --> 02:18:46,111
I'm not the scientist.
I don't get too far in the weeds when 

2923
02:18:46,111 --> 02:18:46,810
the scientists and these conferences 
break off the middle,

2924
02:18:46,811 --> 02:18:49,510
a little group or if ever I have a lot 
of it goes over my head.

2925
02:18:49,510 --> 02:18:51,010
I don't understand what they're talking 
about,

2926
02:18:51,011 --> 02:18:56,011
but I mean there's really,
really smart people that their 

2927
02:18:56,011 --> 02:19:00,430
profession and life is dedicated to this
arena of anti-doping.

2928
02:19:00,730 --> 02:19:05,730
Figuring out what's out there,
figuring out if there's not a test for 

2929
02:19:05,730 --> 02:19:09,031
something,
how to do it and develop it or some 

2930
02:19:09,031 --> 02:19:09,610
super intelligent people on that mission
out there.

2931
02:19:09,640 --> 02:19:14,640
So I'd be concerned if I was using 
anything that at some point someone's 

2932
02:19:15,161 --> 02:19:17,070
not going to come up with a test for it 
or tech.

2933
02:19:17,080 --> 02:19:18,910
What it was,
I would,

2934
02:19:19,240 --> 02:19:19,870
you know,
again,

2935
02:19:19,871 --> 02:19:23,740
part of the stress that's going to be 
out there from someone who's still under

2936
02:19:23,741 --> 02:19:26,260
this program chooses to do something 
that's going to be stressful.

2937
02:19:26,530 --> 02:19:26,950
Yeah.
I mean,

2938
02:19:26,960 --> 02:19:29,060
this is really the gold standard program
now,

2939
02:19:29,090 --> 02:19:29,760
isn't it?
I mean,

2940
02:19:29,850 --> 02:19:31,100
in professional sports.
Okay.

2941
02:19:31,101 --> 02:19:34,820
So there's no other professional sport 
that has number one,

2942
02:19:34,880 --> 02:19:38,120
a truly independent authority 
administering it.

2943
02:19:38,150 --> 02:19:43,150
And what that does is it shows you 
there's not going to be any business 

2944
02:19:43,150 --> 02:19:44,130
interest,
um,

2945
02:19:44,360 --> 02:19:45,400
in,
you know,

2946
02:19:45,410 --> 02:19:50,410
carrying out the program you saw doesn't
give a shit if it's our number one 

2947
02:19:50,410 --> 02:19:51,170
earner,
if they test positive,

2948
02:19:51,380 --> 02:19:53,600
does that benefit them?
They don't care.

2949
02:19:53,601 --> 02:19:55,990
All they care about is clean sport.
They don't care.

2950
02:19:56,030 --> 02:19:59,180
There's gonna be no allegations of 
favoritism.

2951
02:19:59,240 --> 02:20:01,370
You sought.
It doesn't care who the athlete is,

2952
02:20:01,371 --> 02:20:02,720
where,
where they live,

2953
02:20:02,750 --> 02:20:04,610
they're all about clean sport.
Again,

2954
02:20:05,150 --> 02:20:07,190
365 day a year or two.
Well,

2955
02:20:07,191 --> 02:20:12,191
first off,
no other professional sports have that 

2956
02:20:12,191 --> 02:20:12,320
independent nature.
Olympic sports had that.

2957
02:20:12,680 --> 02:20:15,770
They have independent agencies,
but professional sports don't.

2958
02:20:15,860 --> 02:20:17,030
That's huge.
To begin with,

2959
02:20:17,480 --> 02:20:19,520
365 days a year.
Testing.

2960
02:20:19,970 --> 02:20:24,970
I mean,
you look at the other professional 

2961
02:20:24,970 --> 02:20:24,970
sports here,
at least in the United States,

2962
02:20:24,970 --> 02:20:29,030
they can't say that I'm urine and blood 
tests,

2963
02:20:29,200 --> 02:20:31,100
um,
at any point blood by the way,

2964
02:20:31,110 --> 02:20:32,600
we,
a lot of concerns from athletes like,

2965
02:20:32,601 --> 02:20:33,900
man,
how much blood he taken from me,

2966
02:20:33,901 --> 02:20:36,950
that's going to be a deterrent or that 
could affect my performance.

2967
02:20:36,950 --> 02:20:41,950
If you take blood from me,
it's less than a tablespoon of blood 

2968
02:20:41,950 --> 02:20:43,010
really.
So very little amount science shows will

2969
02:20:43,011 --> 02:20:46,970
have no effect whatsoever on your 
performance even later that day.

2970
02:20:47,720 --> 02:20:49,040
Um,
you know,

2971
02:20:49,041 --> 02:20:54,041
the biological passports huge.
So even if you don't find a specific 

2972
02:20:54,041 --> 02:20:54,041
drug,
you know,

2973
02:20:54,041 --> 02:20:56,570
we can go over time and look at abnormal
variances.

2974
02:20:57,090 --> 02:21:02,090
Um,
and so you throw all those things 

2975
02:21:02,090 --> 02:21:03,020
together and you know,
in my experience,

2976
02:21:03,050 --> 02:21:05,540
both dealing with sports here in the US 
and worldwide,

2977
02:21:05,690 --> 02:21:10,690
there's no other organization that 
touches with this thing is now there's 

2978
02:21:10,690 --> 02:21:15,421
some sports that you could argue really,
they just can't exist without 

2979
02:21:15,421 --> 02:21:16,220
performance enhancing drugs.
Bodybuilding,

2980
02:21:16,221 --> 02:21:17,450
of course,
comes to the frontline.

2981
02:21:17,451 --> 02:21:18,980
That's the first one that everybody 
thinks about.

2982
02:21:19,010 --> 02:21:24,010
If bodybuilding instituted something 
like this to sport would change 

2983
02:21:24,010 --> 02:21:27,820
radically overnight.
I mean you would see people shrink to 

2984
02:21:27,820 --> 02:21:27,820
the point where they didn't.

2985
02:21:27,820 --> 02:21:32,460
They bear no resemblance to Dorian Yates
or green or any of these guys that were 

2986
02:21:34,100 --> 02:21:37,600
in their prime that were just these 
freaks that look,

2987
02:21:37,640 --> 02:21:39,560
they didn't even look like real people.
Yeah.

2988
02:21:39,690 --> 02:21:42,410
Not agree with that.
But what about pro football?

2989
02:21:42,650 --> 02:21:47,650
Like those guys are fucking gigantic.
How much of that is strength and 

2990
02:21:47,650 --> 02:21:47,650
conditioning programs?
I mean,

2991
02:21:47,650 --> 02:21:52,481
do you know how much of that is that 
they didn't have those strength and 

2992
02:21:52,481 --> 02:21:55,571
conditioning programs in the sixties and
how much of it is steroids and growth 

2993
02:21:55,571 --> 02:21:55,571
hormone and.
Yeah,

2994
02:21:55,571 --> 02:21:56,450
it's,
it's hard to say.

2995
02:21:56,451 --> 02:21:58,040
I mean they,
they do have,

2996
02:21:58,130 --> 02:21:59,990
they have,
and I know and I've worked with,

2997
02:21:59,991 --> 02:22:02,210
they're people who are instituting their
program.

2998
02:22:02,211 --> 02:22:06,980
Their program is not administered at a,
is not independently administered.

2999
02:22:07,090 --> 02:22:08,630
It's them.
It's in house,

3000
02:22:08,660 --> 02:22:10,790
in house.
So say if they have a star athlete,

3001
02:22:10,791 --> 02:22:12,080
the test positive,
they can kind of.

3002
02:22:12,420 --> 02:22:17,420
You don't know that.
I don't think that's happening because 

3003
02:22:17,420 --> 02:22:19,571
you looked at,
you looked at some of the athletes that 

3004
02:22:19,571 --> 02:22:19,571
have.
And,

3005
02:22:19,571 --> 02:22:19,571
uh,
you know,

3006
02:22:19,571 --> 02:22:20,450
I don't think that's happening,
but you know,

3007
02:22:20,451 --> 02:22:25,451
that question would always pose itself 
because that is the Fox guarding the hen

3008
02:22:25,651 --> 02:22:28,320
house.
They're not nearly as comprehensive.

3009
02:22:28,770 --> 02:22:30,240
It's not.
And you know,

3010
02:22:30,241 --> 02:22:33,240
one thing that I've found in anti-doping
programs,

3011
02:22:33,241 --> 02:22:36,570
you could have the most solid program 
all the way around.

3012
02:22:36,571 --> 02:22:41,571
If you have one little weakness in it.
The tiniest weakness could be a loophole

3013
02:22:41,850 --> 02:22:44,130
that you can drive a tractor trailer 
through.

3014
02:22:44,300 --> 02:22:49,300
I'll give you a perfect example.
Say a program has everything that we 

3015
02:22:49,300 --> 02:22:51,990
have a 365 day year testing.
Say it's even,

3016
02:22:51,991 --> 02:22:56,991
you know,
you sought administering it and say in 

3017
02:22:56,991 --> 02:22:59,010
the collection process,
during the season,

3018
02:22:59,460 --> 02:23:04,460
the collector would call up somebody on 
the team or in the organization the 

3019
02:23:04,460 --> 02:23:04,460
night before and say,
hey,

3020
02:23:04,460 --> 02:23:06,090
I need a parking pass tomorrow.

3021
02:23:06,320 --> 02:23:07,470
Um,
to get in,

3022
02:23:07,471 --> 02:23:09,900
I'm going to be showing up that one 
little phone call.

3023
02:23:09,901 --> 02:23:14,010
Despite all the strength,
comprehensive strength could be,

3024
02:23:14,130 --> 02:23:19,130
could be the weakness that would cause 
everybody to run through that employee 

3025
02:23:19,350 --> 02:23:24,350
is friends with somebody you know,
the players on the team knows who's hot 

3026
02:23:24,350 --> 02:23:25,020
or not makes a call the night before.
Hey Man,

3027
02:23:25,021 --> 02:23:30,021
they're coming tomorrow.
Don't show up tomorrow to the 

3028
02:23:30,021 --> 02:23:34,191
professional sports leagues.
I don't think they do have a three 

3029
02:23:34,191 --> 02:23:34,191
strikes.
Whereabouts,

3030
02:23:34,191 --> 02:23:35,250
policy where if they're not there for a 
certain day,

3031
02:23:35,340 --> 02:23:40,340
then that can be used against them.
Or if they're not there for that day as 

3032
02:23:40,340 --> 02:23:40,340
a test said,
oh,

3033
02:23:40,340 --> 02:23:41,880
I'll just get that person later.
Um,

3034
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:45,040
so little things like that can be 
manipulated to,

3035
02:23:45,110 --> 02:23:47,640
to again,
drive a truck for.

3036
02:23:47,940 --> 02:23:52,940
What did you think about the vandelay 
Silva situation for people not aware of 

3037
02:23:52,940 --> 02:23:53,670
it?
Vandelay Silva,

3038
02:23:53,760 --> 02:23:57,030
they showed up for random drug test out 
of competition.

3039
02:23:57,350 --> 02:23:59,610
Um,
he wasn't scheduled for a fight and just

3040
02:23:59,611 --> 02:24:02,160
bolted.
And when he bolted,

3041
02:24:02,220 --> 02:24:05,610
they gave him a lifetime suspension.
They said you're done.

3042
02:24:05,820 --> 02:24:09,810
Your career is over you.
You avoided a drug test.

3043
02:24:10,350 --> 02:24:11,430
Um,
what,

3044
02:24:11,460 --> 02:24:13,800
what did you think about that?
So first under our program,

3045
02:24:13,801 --> 02:24:17,880
well we had this whereabouts where you 
get basically three strikes in a rolling

3046
02:24:17,881 --> 02:24:22,881
12 months and then there's a sanction 
that's if you know they just can't 

3047
02:24:22,881 --> 02:24:27,351
locate you or you didn't do a good 
enough job or using complete your 

3048
02:24:27,351 --> 02:24:28,590
whereabouts.
If a tester comes to test,

3049
02:24:28,591 --> 02:24:30,720
one of our athletes say out of Jim says,
Hey,

3050
02:24:30,721 --> 02:24:33,960
I'm here from Usada to test you and that
athlete says,

3051
02:24:34,230 --> 02:24:37,680
screw you and runs out the back door as 
a sanction right there,

3052
02:24:37,740 --> 02:24:42,740
a penalty and potentially under our 
system with aggravating circumstances 

3053
02:24:42,740 --> 02:24:47,721
could be four years.
That may be an aggravating circumstance 

3054
02:24:47,721 --> 02:24:47,940
where this guy or girl said,
screw you,

3055
02:24:47,970 --> 02:24:50,220
I'm not doing this thing and runs out 
the back door.

3056
02:24:50,220 --> 02:24:55,220
So that's four years on the first time 
his case that he had had one before and 

3057
02:24:55,220 --> 02:24:56,910
he had a positive before.
That was the first one.

3058
02:24:56,970 --> 02:24:58,050
It was this first one.
Uh,

3059
02:24:58,200 --> 02:25:03,200
well he,
he obviously didn't test positive even 

3060
02:25:03,200 --> 02:25:03,200
then because he didn't test it all.
But then he admitted that he was,

3061
02:25:03,720 --> 02:25:07,380
in his words,
he was taking some sort of a.

3062
02:25:07,740 --> 02:25:10,500
It wasn't a steroid,
I think it was a diuretic,

3063
02:25:10,501 --> 02:25:13,800
it was saying because he had fluid build
up something.

3064
02:25:14,300 --> 02:25:16,660
It didn't make any sense to me.
Um,

3065
02:25:16,980 --> 02:25:20,970
but like Aldo,
he avoided taking a drug test in Brazil.

3066
02:25:20,971 --> 02:25:22,080
Correct.
Uh,

3067
02:25:22,110 --> 02:25:23,010
I mean,
I don't know if that's the,

3068
02:25:23,350 --> 02:25:24,400
that he avoided it.
I mean,

3069
02:25:24,401 --> 02:25:28,350
there was obviously,
I think Nevada play,

3070
02:25:28,380 --> 02:25:31,300
you know,
publicly disclosed what was played out.

3071
02:25:31,360 --> 02:25:36,360
They sent a collector here from the 
United States down there and showed up 

3072
02:25:36,360 --> 02:25:36,520
at the gym.

3073
02:25:37,510 --> 02:25:39,660
They disputed whether or not.
Yeah.

3074
02:25:39,670 --> 02:25:41,110
Who knows what happened.
One thing,

3075
02:25:41,140 --> 02:25:44,410
you know,
I don't know exactly how everything went

3076
02:25:44,411 --> 02:25:49,411
down there.
One thing I can say is under our 

3077
02:25:49,411 --> 02:25:49,411
program,
and that's one of the reasons we went to

3078
02:25:49,411 --> 02:25:54,121
Usada.
Usada needs to go to another country to 

3079
02:25:54,121 --> 02:25:55,510
do a collection like that.
They reach out to the national authority

3080
02:25:55,511 --> 02:26:00,511
of that country so that when somebody 
shows up on behalf of you saw or with 

3081
02:26:00,511 --> 02:26:05,011
Usada out of gym,
you're not going to get an instance or 

3082
02:26:05,011 --> 02:26:05,011
you know,
reasoning that,

3083
02:26:05,011 --> 02:26:06,460
hey,
we didn't know who this person was.

3084
02:26:06,461 --> 02:26:09,250
There'll be credentialed.
Every bone will know who they are.

3085
02:26:09,550 --> 02:26:12,490
There'll be a representative from that,
that nation there.

3086
02:26:12,670 --> 02:26:15,190
I think they tested,
although sample anyway,

3087
02:26:15,191 --> 02:26:17,230
if I'm correct.
And he tested negative,

3088
02:26:17,231 --> 02:26:18,160
is that true?
They did.

3089
02:26:18,161 --> 02:26:23,161
Ultimately,
I think it was the next day that he 

3090
02:26:23,161 --> 02:26:23,161
provided a sample,
um,

3091
02:26:23,161 --> 02:26:27,210
and that did test negative,
but there was some issues about the day 

3092
02:26:27,210 --> 02:26:29,890
before or sample wasn't provided,
um,

3093
02:26:30,160 --> 02:26:35,160
because because it went 24 hours and he 
could have whatever he had could have 

3094
02:26:35,160 --> 02:26:37,280
cleaned out of a system that is,
you know,

3095
02:26:37,330 --> 02:26:38,200
that would be a concern.

3096
02:26:38,200 --> 02:26:39,270
Sure.
What,

3097
02:26:39,290 --> 02:26:44,290
uh,
so they can test for human growth 

3098
02:26:44,290 --> 02:26:46,741
hormone now too,
which was something that they couldn't 

3099
02:26:46,741 --> 02:26:47,410
ask for for a long time.
They couldn't true.

3100
02:26:47,411 --> 02:26:50,230
And there's also another test that came 
out for it,

3101
02:26:50,380 --> 02:26:55,380
um,
where they can run back a couple of 

3102
02:26:55,380 --> 02:26:55,380
weeks.
It used to be with a blood test,

3103
02:26:55,380 --> 02:26:59,230
she would have had to detect it within 
maybe 24 hours of its use.

3104
02:26:59,850 --> 02:27:02,350
Um,
there is now an isoform test,

3105
02:27:02,351 --> 02:27:05,620
which isn't necessarily for the drug 
itself,

3106
02:27:05,621 --> 02:27:07,900
but kind of like with the biological 
passport.

3107
02:27:07,901 --> 02:27:12,901
If you take growth hormone,
it will affect certain markers in you 

3108
02:27:12,901 --> 02:27:14,500
that will last over time,
even if the drug is cleared your system,

3109
02:27:14,890 --> 02:27:19,890
so it gives anti-doping that ability to 
reach back a couple of weeks and 

3110
02:27:19,890 --> 02:27:20,980
determine if it was used.
So again,

3111
02:27:21,160 --> 02:27:26,110
an evolving tool that you know,
maybe some organization says,

3112
02:27:26,120 --> 02:27:27,700
Oh,
news tests two weeks,

3113
02:27:28,060 --> 02:27:33,060
we can call back all those frozen sample
that's go back and retest them and see 

3114
02:27:33,060 --> 02:27:35,800
that maybe it wasn't within 24 hours an 
athlete use but two weeks.

3115
02:27:35,800 --> 02:27:40,800
So that factor I think is always hanging
out there for somebody who chooses to 

3116
02:27:40,800 --> 02:27:42,370
do,
to use the substances band.

3117
02:27:43,030 --> 02:27:48,030
Well Jeff,
thank you very much for coming on here 

3118
02:27:48,030 --> 02:27:50,761
and then taking the time to explain all 
this stuff and thank you very much for 

3119
02:27:50,761 --> 02:27:52,930
this incredibly comprehensive effort to 
clean up the sport.

3120
02:27:52,931 --> 02:27:55,360
I think it's awesome and I think what 
you're doing is just.

3121
02:27:55,780 --> 02:27:56,840
It's very,
it's very,

3122
02:27:56,890 --> 02:28:01,890
it's very intriguing.
It's inspiring and I think ultimately 

3123
02:28:01,890 --> 02:28:02,530
it's great for the sport.
Appreciate it.

3124
02:28:02,531 --> 02:28:04,020
Yeah.
He wants to say no,

3125
02:28:04,030 --> 02:28:04,810
I think I'm good,
man.

3126
02:28:04,840 --> 02:28:06,640
Thanks for having me on.
Thanks for the platform.

3127
02:28:06,641 --> 02:28:08,530
And Yeah,
look forward to seeing you at a,

3128
02:28:08,670 --> 02:28:09,880
an event soon.
Absolutely.

3129
02:28:09,940 --> 02:28:11,740
My pleasure,
Jeff Novitsky.

3130
02:28:11,741 --> 02:28:16,741
Ladies and gentlemen,
we'll be back tomorrow with Jeff Ross 

3131
02:28:16,741 --> 02:28:16,741
and,
uh,

3132
02:28:16,741 --> 02:28:17,110
that's it.
Enjoy your day.

3133
02:28:17,111 --> 02:28:17,980
Thank you everybody.
Bye.

3134
02:28:17,981 --> 02:28:22,981
Bye.
Two hours.

3135
02:28:29,241 --> 02:28:29,930
Thirty five minutes.
