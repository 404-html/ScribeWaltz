1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:05,290
The joe rogan experience,
you can actually beat him if you're

2
00:00:05,291 --> 00:00:07,690
going to push it all the,

3
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:09,910
what is it in your brain that makes you
do that?

4
00:00:09,911 --> 00:00:13,870
Cause like we just looked at your mvps
that you burned a thousand calories.

5
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:16,900
Is there some sort of,
I talked to Pat McAfee one time,

6
00:00:16,901 --> 00:00:18,220
he said it's about exclusivity.

7
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:22,640
It's about rape and murder.
It's my head's filled with it.

8
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:27,080
Stopping rapists and stop and murderers
and killing child molesters.

9
00:00:27,081 --> 00:00:30,170
That's what I think about killing bad
people when you work out.

10
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,730
Yeah.
That's what I do when I get tired.

11
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,550
If I get tired,
I think about like saving someone I care

12
00:00:34,551 --> 00:00:37,190
about.
I think about stopping someone who's

13
00:00:37,191 --> 00:00:39,710
trying to murder someone I love.
That's what I think about.

14
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:43,370
I love your face.
I'm not kidding.

15
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:48,860
I think about my second wife.
I think about protecting people I care

16
00:00:48,861 --> 00:00:49,930
about.
Then you tell,

17
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,060
you told me one time,
um,

18
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:53,990
if it's hard,
you'll go a pretending someone is trying

19
00:00:53,991 --> 00:00:54,950
to kill me.
Yeah.

20
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:56,960
Yeah.
So you're like pretending.

21
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,530
Yeah.
I really don't have words for that.

22
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:02,780
That's what you gotta do.
Cause that's,

23
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:05,450
that's what if you think about worst
case scenario,

24
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:09,290
you're tired and someone's trying to
kill someone you care about and you

25
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:10,700
don't have enough energy to stop them.

26
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,480
But do you think you learned that switch
in like a tie?

27
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:16,040
Tuck one or not taekwondo?
Uh,

28
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,130
uh,

29
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:18,600
yeah,
I learned it from martial arts for sure.

30
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:19,463
Yeah.
Yeah,

31
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:20,281
sure.
Yeah.

32
00:01:20,281 --> 00:01:22,230
Yeah,
because that's the scariest place you

33
00:01:22,231 --> 00:01:24,660
could ever be.
Like the scariest place you could be is

34
00:01:24,661 --> 00:01:28,470
life and death.
So like it just putting yourself in

35
00:01:28,471 --> 00:01:29,550
Olin,
just want to lose weight.

36
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:30,503
Okay,
good.

37
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:31,980
Yeah,
that's good.

38
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:33,840
Well,
but that's not,

39
00:01:33,841 --> 00:01:37,960
you're not going to save yourself like
you gotta you gotta put yourself in like

40
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,130
animalistic fury.
That's how you get,

41
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,710
you got to put yourself,
you got to put yourself in this,

42
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:47,150
this state of just 100% effort.
Yeah.

43
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:52,160
I was pegged at like 180 177 beats per
minute for the last 35 35 minutes.

44
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,490
That's really right.
It's got to do it.

45
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:59,950
See the,
you know that David Goggins guy had

46
00:01:59,951 --> 00:02:03,210
gotten my head with a just embrace the
suck.

47
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:03,910
Yeah,
I can,

48
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:06,360
I can get there where I go and just pray
like,

49
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:07,950
like doing the marathon.
I just go,

50
00:02:07,951 --> 00:02:09,450
this is where I'm going be in for the
next five and half hours.

51
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,340
This is where I'm at and this what I'm
doing and I can,

52
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,130
I can wrap my head around that.
I don't know if I can wrap my head

53
00:02:14,131 --> 00:02:17,190
around like I don't know the explicit
severity of it and going like,

54
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,560
I'm going to save my family and then
getting,

55
00:02:19,561 --> 00:02:21,510
but that might not work for you,
but there still could be a different

56
00:02:21,511 --> 00:02:23,310
tactic that works for you.
You know what I mean?

57
00:02:23,311 --> 00:02:28,311
Like even like bat going that fucking
hard to where your body is completely

58
00:02:29,761 --> 00:02:31,440
giving out.
There's part of me that goes,

59
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:32,970
hey man,
what are we doing here?

60
00:02:32,971 --> 00:02:34,920
You know,
like when I'm working out I go,

61
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,330
that's really fucking hard.

62
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,700
Well you got,
you definitely have to protect your

63
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:39,534
health,
right?

64
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,120
Like the last you want to be doing this
and having a heart attack.

65
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,070
That's my,
that's always my fear is I go easy

66
00:02:45,071 --> 00:02:45,850
buddy.

67
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:50,590
Easy buddy is a good way to look at it.
But I've been doing that kind of working

68
00:02:50,591 --> 00:02:52,660
out forever.
That's how I work out.

69
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:53,430
Yeah,
that's,

70
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,020
you always were crazy.
Yeah,

71
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:58,150
I go crazy.
Did you ever think of,

72
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,220
have you ever thought about who like
really

73
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:03,130
disrespected you right before you lift?
You know what I mean?

74
00:03:03,131 --> 00:03:05,230
Like right before us.
And that's all that happens online.

75
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:09,680
You can't read that shit
ever.

76
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,530
I've gone to like a moment where you're
like,

77
00:03:11,531 --> 00:03:13,420
I wish I would have cracked that dude in
the face.

78
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:16,180
And then right before,
right before I said no,

79
00:03:16,181 --> 00:03:18,750
I have not been.
I know I'm definitely know what I want.

80
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,500
I know who I'm thinking about and I'm
gonna try it.

81
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:21,440
All right.
Don't say any names.

82
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:24,080
What does he rhyme with?
[inaudible]

83
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,610
you guys are doing or you guys can do a
benefit,

84
00:03:27,611 --> 00:03:29,350
a comedy benefit?
I would do anything.

85
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:32,440
I'll help out however I can,
but he doesn't need come on my show to

86
00:03:32,441 --> 00:03:33,550
do.
If he's thinking I went here for three

87
00:03:33,551 --> 00:03:34,780
hours,
I'll do whatever you want.

88
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:36,580
What?
Same like make sure I don't forget his

89
00:03:36,581 --> 00:03:38,830
name.
It seemed like I was on the plane the

90
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:39,580
other day,
man.

91
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:40,980
And this,
um,

92
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,210
I don't want mess up his name and be a
dickhead.

93
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:44,410
And uh,
Oh,

94
00:03:44,411 --> 00:03:46,350
Ray Borg.
I've seen Ray Borg son,

95
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:51,700
no sick babies having these surgeries.
And I saw someone post a shirt,

96
00:03:52,661 --> 00:03:53,930
that ray board,
uh,

97
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,280
go to Ray Borg,
instagram or twitter and he puts his

98
00:03:57,281 --> 00:03:57,671
shirt,
he goes,

99
00:03:57,671 --> 00:04:01,750
all these profe the proceeds from the
shirt go to help me pay for my child's

100
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:04,660
medical bill.
And so a song,

101
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:05,800
go shop,
look into this.

102
00:04:05,801 --> 00:04:07,670
And so I clicked on it and I see it.

103
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:08,920
You don't have a two and a half ago.
It's son.

104
00:04:08,921 --> 00:04:10,980
I see his son on the,
the like the,

105
00:04:10,981 --> 00:04:15,981
the frickin respirator broke my heart.
So I dm Tim and Ray,

106
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:18,490
I,
I'm sure bunch of people hit you up,

107
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:19,540
man.
There it is.

108
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,780
Idm Gray because we need help with the
medical bills.

109
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,940
I will pay for your medical bills,
right?

110
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,620
I will cover it man.
So when I,

111
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:29,320
when I say here,
I get emotional because I see a son.

112
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,220
When I say I'll help you re I'm dead
serious man.

113
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,160
I'm not one of these guys who just,
I don't need the publicity.

114
00:04:36,161 --> 00:04:39,970
I don't need any of that.
I sent you my idmg by number.

115
00:04:39,971 --> 00:04:41,800

00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:47,710
It's not a game.
It's no publicity.

119
00:04:47,711 --> 00:04:49,720
I will take care of you.
You and your family.

120
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:51,570
That's it.
Well look,

Emotional dude.

122
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,640

125
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:59,500
Just took me by surprise.
Sorry Dude.

126
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,090
I'm good now.
Do you know ray?

127
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:02,560
I don't know man.
I'll never met him.

128
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,480
Wow.
Never met him.

129
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:08,050
So how much money does he need to raise?
I don't know,

130
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:09,100
but I'm fucking rich.

131
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,150
I'm doing a show in Utah.
Donate all the money I make from my six

132
00:05:16,151 --> 00:05:17,680
shows.
And you told his medical bills.

133
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,120
Beautiful.
That's beautiful man.

134
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:21,040
Wiseguys St Louis.
October,

I think 10th through the 12th I'm doing
for her.

136
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,060
I think it's six shows.
I'll take all that money.

137
00:05:25,061 --> 00:05:26,470
You can have it right.
That was beautiful.

138
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,040
That's a beautiful place to great place,
man.

139
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,390
Yeah.
Love,

00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,660
Love Utah.

141
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:35,170
Does he not have medical insurance?
I don't know.

142
00:05:35,171 --> 00:05:36,370
I don't think it covers it.
And He,

143
00:05:36,371 --> 00:05:37,540
you know,
he's a broke fighter.

144
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:39,040
Yeah.
He's a broke fighter man.

145
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,290
And I just,
dude,

146
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:44,350
I'm so fortunate,
like me finding standup and I get so

You know,

152
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:52,720
I'm like,
after we have to figure something out

153
00:05:52,721 --> 00:05:54,070
here,
that's when I saw that I'm like,

154
00:05:54,071 --> 00:05:56,230
what the fuck man,
that's awesome man.

155
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,580
They think that it's because of the
singular

156
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:02,030
aspect of their diet and the fact that
they've eliminated everything else,

157
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,450
but they're not,
they don't do any studying of

158
00:06:05,451 --> 00:06:08,480
elimination diets.
They don't do any study of the prolonged

159
00:06:08,481 --> 00:06:11,720
benefits of fasting and all these
different things that you're talking

160
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:13,790
about,
which I think are v there.

161
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:19,330
These are all factors in this really
complicated thing that's going on that

162
00:06:19,371 --> 00:06:23,330
most likely has something to do with
their gut biome and their immune system.

163
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:24,750
Right?
Absolutely.

164
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,640
I mean,
those are two major confounding factors

165
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:30,630
was like so major,
you know,

166
00:06:30,631 --> 00:06:31,800
it's,
um,

167
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:36,420
it's important.
It's just important to approach this

168
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,710
like a science,
you know,

169
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,570
and,
and not like a religion,

170
00:06:39,571 --> 00:06:41,190
like you said,
where are you want to believe something.

171
00:06:41,191 --> 00:06:42,810
And so you just find,
you know,

172
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,960
this,
this study that I also see circulating

173
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,460
lot around that why plants are really
bad to eat.

174
00:06:47,461 --> 00:06:51,180
It's like they're there,
they're there means that the insect anti

175
00:06:51,181 --> 00:06:53,820
nutrients or pesticides or my former
mentor.

176
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:56,400
Okay.
Dr. Bruce Ames who spent his entire

177
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:01,230
career like advocating micro nutrients
from vegetables and from me and from

178
00:07:01,231 --> 00:07:01,900
fish.
Okay.

179
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:05,040
It's like so ironic,
but if you actually read the paper,

180
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:06,990
not only does it say it doesn't,
you know,

181
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:09,090
these,
these insect anti feed ins like

182
00:07:09,091 --> 00:07:12,250
sulforaphane don't cause cancer,
but it also goes,

183
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:16,890
has a whole section on Heterocyclic
aimings from cooked meat.

184
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:19,830
So if you really want to use that paper
as an argument,

185
00:07:19,831 --> 00:07:22,800
why to not eat plants,
then maybe read the paper and realize,

186
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,630
oh,
it's also talking about Heterocyclic

187
00:07:24,631 --> 00:07:27,630
aimings as well.
The point of the paper was like,

188
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,350
I'm getting a little motion him.
I'm sorry sir.

189
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,390
I'm sorry.
I like it.

190
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,480
Um,
the getting out of your robot.

191
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:38,130
The point of the paper was basically not
to worry about like some of the amounts

192
00:07:38,131 --> 00:07:40,230
that you're being exposed to you with
some of these natural,

193
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,690
you know,
ants in sec anti feed that are found in

194
00:07:42,691 --> 00:07:46,230
plants and some of the cook things and
meet and as well as some of the

195
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:49,680
pesticides that are found in synthetic
pesticides because it basically that

196
00:07:49,681 --> 00:07:52,110
they're in such small amounts that,
so that was kind of the point of the

197
00:07:52,111 --> 00:07:54,270
paper was back in the 90s.
Um,

198
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,940
and,
but I just think that it's a little,

199
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,670
I don't know how hypocritical to use a
paper,

200
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:00,760
you know,
as a,

201
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,130
as like,
and literally it's like,

202
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,380
I mean it's like proliferate it
everywhere.

203
00:08:04,381 --> 00:08:06,090
That's a pic,
this paper all the time.

204
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:07,020
It's like,
well,

205
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,080
did you read the paper?
Because it has a whole section on um,

206
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,780
on the insect antipodes from coffee,
which a lot of people drink.

207
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:14,700
And also for me,

208
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:17,900
like that didn't stick.
But then some of them do stay,

209
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,890
you can't say retarded anymore.
That one sticking.

210
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,080
Right.
Like and people are realizing there's

211
00:08:23,081 --> 00:08:25,300
certain things that you can do and
certain things you can't do.

212
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,730
Certain things.
We accept certain things we can't accept

213
00:08:27,731 --> 00:08:31,120
anymore and we're figuring it out and
we're figuring it out in real time,

214
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,730
in a,
at a radical pace that's never existed

215
00:08:33,731 --> 00:08:38,731
before in human history where something
that was acceptable just 10 15 years ago

216
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:42,580
is completely unacceptable now that's,
there's never been a time like that

217
00:08:42,581 --> 00:08:45,610
before.
Never been a time in the entire world

218
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,780
since people started talking.
There's never been a time where change

219
00:08:49,781 --> 00:08:54,220
is taking place at such a radical pace,
and you're a part of it and I'm a part

220
00:08:54,221 --> 00:08:56,040
of it and everyone is to,
this is a part of it.

221
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:59,250
We're all together in this and no one
knows where the fuck it's going.

222
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:00,330
Okay.

223
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:03,780
I love that you're,
you're saying that the reason all this

224
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,760
is happening right now is because we are
now,

225
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,010
we're just communicating at a more rapid
pace.

226
00:09:08,011 --> 00:09:10,650
That's all it boils down to.
You're absolutely right.

227
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:13,470
It's the communication revolution.

228
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,480
Yeah.
Yeah.

229
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:15,800
And if so,
if someone says,

230
00:09:15,801 --> 00:09:16,634
you know,
well,

231
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:17,503
hey you,
you,

232
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:18,920
you said it doesn't make sense.
Like,

233
00:09:18,921 --> 00:09:19,730
yeah,
yeah,

234
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:20,563
for sure.
Well,

235
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,670
no one's going to get it right.
No one's going to get it right all the

236
00:09:22,671 --> 00:09:23,870
time.
Like no one does.

237
00:09:23,871 --> 00:09:24,351
No,
I'm,

238
00:09:24,351 --> 00:09:26,540
I'm not an oracle.
My fucking human.

239
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:28,520
I was born in New Jersey.
No,

240
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,200
it's no getting this right.

241
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,380
Being held to that standard oil.
We all are now

242
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,940
what's be,
there's good to that too.

243
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,940
Okay.
The good is you realize like what you're

244
00:09:38,941 --> 00:09:40,960
responsible,
like if you make a mistake and what,

245
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:43,800
or you say something incorrect or you
say something mean they were just trying

246
00:09:43,801 --> 00:09:45,870
to be funny to came out bad,
but the,

247
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:46,500
the,
the,

248
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,820
the blow back,
let's,

249
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:50,940
you know,
this is how people feel about that and

250
00:09:50,941 --> 00:09:54,570
it's a disproportionate,
because your signals disproportionate do

251
00:09:54,571 --> 00:09:56,530
your ability to express yourself as
disproportionate.

252
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:57,840
Yeah.
So the blow back is going to be

253
00:09:57,841 --> 00:10:00,810
disproportionate as well,
so it feels awful.

254
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,970
But that's just,
uh,

255
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,200
an affirmation.
Just letting you know.

256
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:04,801
Okay.
No,

257
00:10:04,801 --> 00:10:08,490
the fake ass as an audience,
you got to just keep the spectacle alive

258
00:10:08,491 --> 00:10:09,540
almost.
You know what I mean?

259
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,390
Yeah.
If it's not a spectacle,

260
00:10:12,391 --> 00:10:15,000
it's not interesting.
I guess I have to keep changing things.

261
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:17,640
If it's not an absolute spectacle to the
vision,

262
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:21,470
your,
your brain will catch onto the the my

263
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,080
favorite word.

264
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,340
Fuckery.
Yeah.

265
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,230
I love that word too.
It's my favorite word.

266
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,230
It's a great word.
Yeah,

267
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,740
it's a good way.
It really is like a great,

268
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:30,690
first of all,
it's a word that you can get away with

269
00:10:30,691 --> 00:10:32,570
no matter what.
It's not a word that you,

270
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:34,350
you know,
eventually you won't be able to use

271
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,860
anymore.
Oh fuck.

272
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:38,430
He is just going to be around forever
and it's just,

273
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:41,400
it is perfect for like nonsense.
Yeah.

274
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:44,130
I've,
I've been my English friends for years.

275
00:10:44,131 --> 00:10:47,100
We're saying fuckery.
That's the thing that's in that it's

276
00:10:47,101 --> 00:10:49,260
only recently catching on over here.
Yeah.

277
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,810
Really?
No last,

278
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:51,810
you know,
10 years.

279
00:10:51,811 --> 00:10:53,970
I'm talking about since the eighties I
been here fuckery.

280
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,710
I'm trying to figure out when I started
using it,

281
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:57,840
I started using in regards to martial
arts,

282
00:10:57,841 --> 00:11:01,050
like fake martial arts.
I use it in all kinds of stuff.

283
00:11:01,051 --> 00:11:03,690
You can use it lightheartedly you could
use it seriously.

284
00:11:03,691 --> 00:11:05,000
Yeah.
Everything.

285
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,260
It's as versatile as just plain old
fuck.

286
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:08,460
Yeah.
Yeah.

287
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:11,070
Steve Maxwell,
that's where I got it from and I started

288
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,830
using what Steve Maxwell,
he was describing some fake martial arts

289
00:11:13,831 --> 00:11:16,800
talking about,
cause you know Steve's a black belt in

290
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:17,820
Jujitsu and he's like,
yeah,

291
00:11:17,821 --> 00:11:19,260
it's,
it's a lot of fuckery.

292
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:20,130
And I was like,
Ooh,

293
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,030
it's a great word.
That's a word I'm going to keep using.

294
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,670
I just looked it up to see if there was
a good definition.

295
00:11:26,671 --> 00:11:29,880
And it says it's also a definition for
another word for a brothel.

296
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,080
A fucker.
Fucker.

297
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:34,860
Right.
Holy Shit Dude.

298
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:37,500
You're just like opened my brain and a
new way.

299
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:40,720
Chorus.
Oh Duh.

300
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,350
Of course they'd call it,
are you going to the fuckery?

301
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:49,170
Yeah,
like a brewery of fuckery.

302
