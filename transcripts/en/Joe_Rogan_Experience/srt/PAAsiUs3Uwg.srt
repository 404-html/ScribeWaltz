1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,560
The joe rogan experience,

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:02,251
which by the way,

3
00:00:02,251 --> 00:00:05,370
did you just see this new fucking
thing that they're going to release the

4
00:00:05,371 --> 00:00:06,204
Facebook phone?

5
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:06,631
No,

6
00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:10,350
the Samsung is going to release
something called the Galaxy Mega.

7
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:11,310
No.

8
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:12,270
Holy Shit,

9
00:00:12,271 --> 00:00:12,541
dude.

10
00:00:12,541 --> 00:00:13,830
It's six inches.

11
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,080
It's like there's two versions of it.

12
00:00:16,081 --> 00:00:19,410
There's a 5.8 inch and a 6.3 inch.

13
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:20,101
You're like,

14
00:00:20,101 --> 00:00:21,840
what the fuck are you talking about?

15
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:22,980
That's not a phone.

16
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,061
What am I going to do it?

17
00:00:24,061 --> 00:00:24,540
That's,

18
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:25,140
that's,

19
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,310
that's a crazy thing.

20
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:27,630
I don't know what that is.

21
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:28,561
I Dunno what that is.

22
00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:33,390
That's some cross crossover world thing
that you have to have a man first to

23
00:00:33,391 --> 00:00:34,224
carry that around.

24
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:36,150
Or a woman and woman would be excellent.

25
00:00:36,151 --> 00:00:38,040
If I was a girl and I had a bag,

26
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:38,461
you know,

27
00:00:38,461 --> 00:00:39,780
girls are allowed to carry purses,

28
00:00:39,781 --> 00:00:41,040
which is so awesome.

29
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:41,630
You know,

30
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:43,480
there's one thing they have got us with,

31
00:00:43,481 --> 00:00:44,790
with this society,

32
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:45,301
not women,

33
00:00:45,301 --> 00:00:48,870
but the societies got us whipped with
this stupid idea that somehow or another,

34
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,680
a man's on a lot of carry a purse.

35
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,590
You don't record the Robin Hood days.

36
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,510
Those mother fuckers had shoulder bags.

37
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:55,200
Okay.

38
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,580
You're allowed to wear a backpack.

39
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:59,310
I'm wearing a backpack like
I'm a fucking school kid.

40
00:00:59,311 --> 00:01:00,730
Went through to two.

41
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,340
Nobody gives me a hard time with it,

42
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:03,660
but if I wear a fanny pack,

43
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:05,110
they will look at me like someone,

44
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:06,900
God damn freaking nature.

45
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,191
I'll tell you folks,

46
00:01:08,191 --> 00:01:09,620
we got to take back the fanny packs.

47
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:13,230
Go to take back the fanny pack and
maybe even introduce a fucking purse.

48
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:13,860
Huh?

49
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,090
How about them apples?

50
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:16,890
Get yourself a purse,

51
00:01:16,891 --> 00:01:17,724
boys.

52
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,630
Fuck it.

53
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:18,961
Yeah,

54
00:01:18,961 --> 00:01:20,160
you got a little man purse.

55
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,410
There's nothing wrong with that man.

56
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,450
The idea that there's something somehow
or another feminine or weak about

57
00:01:27,451 --> 00:01:32,451
carrying around a bag is a
perplexing aspect of this society.

58
00:01:32,521 --> 00:01:33,241
Ladies and gentlemen,

59
00:01:33,241 --> 00:01:35,100
it doesn't make any sense.

60
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:37,340
We are allowed to carry certain bags.

61
00:01:37,341 --> 00:01:39,630
If you're carrying like a
military style Duffel bag,

62
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:40,770
that's fine,

63
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,570
but you're not allowed to have a purse.

64
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,220
You can't go through the
airport with a purse.

65
00:01:44,221 --> 00:01:45,180
Dudes will laugh at you.

66
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,800
Dudes with backpacks,

67
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,290
carrying duffle bags will laugh at you.

68
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:50,190
If you've got a purse,

69
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,620
we'll give you this guy
with his fucking purse.

70
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,341
What is that?

71
00:01:53,341 --> 00:01:53,881
A purse,

72
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:54,630
Bro.

73
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:55,620
You go to fucking prison.

74
00:01:55,621 --> 00:01:58,080
What is that difference
between the fucking person?

75
00:01:58,081 --> 00:01:58,980
A backpack?

76
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,480
What's going on here?

77
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,231
Come on,

78
00:02:01,231 --> 00:02:02,060
man.

79
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:02,970
A duffel bags.

80
00:02:02,971 --> 00:02:03,361
Okay.

81
00:02:03,361 --> 00:02:04,920
And I can't have a fucking purse.

82
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,600
This is nonsense.

83
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:11,430
We have subjected ourselves
to some nonsense that we
just have accepted over the

84
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,010
years and now it's become
culture and Brian Red Bank.

85
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,540
God bless you for breaking the mold,

86
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:16,020
young man.

87
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:16,561
God bless you.

88
00:02:16,561 --> 00:02:17,550
Keep my zantax.

89
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,840
Keep your antech.

90
00:02:18,841 --> 00:02:19,530
What does antiques,

91
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,140
but is that I have from drinking
too much heartburn medicine.

92
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,690
You take heartburn medicine.

93
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,410
Yeah.

94
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:26,243
Oh Dude.

95
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,470
Silly Bitch.
