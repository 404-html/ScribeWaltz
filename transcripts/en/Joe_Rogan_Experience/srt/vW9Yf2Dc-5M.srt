Hello Freak bitches.
I'm just something has hit the Internet 

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:08,830
that I need to show you.
I guess it may or may not be legit,

3
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:13,420
but I decided to retire young thanks to 
the cheese catches later.

4
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:16,030
Conor mcgregor.
He's trolling you think so.

5
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:16,923
Fuck yeah,
there's a lot of people have been 

6
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:22,140
hitting me up telling me to show you and
no one knows what's going on.

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,650
I decided to retire young,
which means like 34 eventually.

8
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:28,323
Listen man.
Unless he got fucking head kick today 

9
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:32,303
and knocked into oblivion.
The idea that he's going to go out on a 

10
00:00:35,641 --> 00:00:39,060
loss like that to nate Diaz Hook.
He's got plenty of cash.

11
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,170
If he wanted to retire young and step 
away,

12
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:44,693
I mean I guarantee you,
he probably made somewhere in the 

13
00:00:48,691 --> 00:00:51,150
neighborhood of 5 million bucks of the 
Aldo fight.

14
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,210
He probably made more than that for the 
Nate Diaz fight.

15
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,253
I would.
I would imagine after he spent a fuck 

16
00:00:56,731 --> 00:00:57,564
load of it,
he's probably still got a few million 

17
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,990
bucks laying around.
He's a hero in Ireland.

18
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:04,110
He could always make money.
You can always run a gym and be fine,

19
00:01:04,111 --> 00:01:07,890
but if I had a gas,
it doesn't make any sense.

20
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:09,023
The only reason why it would make sense,
the only reason why it would make sense 

21
00:01:11,581 --> 00:01:16,410
as connor had actually thought about 
retiring from mma before he got the call

22
00:01:16,411 --> 00:01:17,244
for the UFC.
There was a point in time where he had 

23
00:01:19,981 --> 00:01:20,814
some friends that were experiencing some
serious health issues from fighting and 

24
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:25,913
then most recently that young man from 
the Portuguese guy died in an mma 

25
00:01:30,361 --> 00:01:32,430
contest,
which I think took place in the UK.

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,833
What wasn't he involved or related in 
some way to one of those guys that just 

27
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:39,350
died too?
Didn't he know him?

28
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:40,050
Are trained with him?

29
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:43,130
I think he trained with the Portuguese 
guy that just died recently.

30
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:46,760
It is entirely possible in that sense,
but if I had to guess,

31
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:48,860
there's no way he'd do it like this.
