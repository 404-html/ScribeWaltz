1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,930
The joe rogan experience.
Joey.

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:05,180
Oh,
Joey Diaz calm.

3
00:00:05,181 --> 00:00:06,110
Yeah,
but damn,

4
00:00:06,111 --> 00:00:08,090
you got 18 say bitch ass shit ain't
going to work in here.

5
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:10,430
Hung Up.
T and t doesn't work in here.

6
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:14,620
Yeah,
but a column call it called Joe Joey

7
00:00:14,621 --> 00:00:16,630
really quick.
I think he knows I'm on the podcast.

8
00:00:16,631 --> 00:00:18,920
He probably wants to say something.
It's probably hard as fuck right now.

9
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:21,340
Joe Rogan.
What is he going to say?

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,540
Predict,
uh,

11
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:25,330
what he would say Eddie Bravo.
I told you I told you.

12
00:00:25,331 --> 00:00:27,430
Cock saga.
Electric Chair all day.

13
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:29,563
Let's see.

14
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,420
You have reached the voice.

15
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,750
Oh yeah.
Something might have happened.

16
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,460
It might've got pulled into a meeting
and Joey Diaz,

17
00:00:38,461 --> 00:00:42,270
his Bolo on the fuck up.
He's selling out everywhere.

18
00:00:42,271 --> 00:00:45,900
He's constantly getting brought in from
meetings and fucking people want them to

19
00:00:45,901 --> 00:00:48,060
do movies and it's just,
it's incredible.

20
00:00:48,061 --> 00:00:48,894
It's incredible scene.

21
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:50,953
Okay.

22
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:53,130
Yeah,
he's okay.

23
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,880
I might've went over the four oh five or
something.

24
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:58,570
This is it.
I have to ask you this.

25
00:00:58,590 --> 00:00:58,750
Okay.

26
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,020
Did the,
did the Indian come out after

27
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,340
party?
No.

28
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:03,440
No.
I don't feel it.

29
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:04,531
I don't know.
It was like,

30
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:07,350
no,
probably so tired right now.

31
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:09,080
I just didn't feel it,
Joey.

32
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:10,573
Oh,
it's ringing.

33
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,700
Check this out.
I think it's going to work.

34
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:14,683
Yeah.

35
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:17,063
Okay.

36
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:19,480
I'm not sure if he's going to answer.

37
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,310
How are you?
Good to be a gangster.

38
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:24,960
You're on the radio.
Tell him,

39
00:01:24,961 --> 00:01:27,210
tell him you love that you're live on
the podcast.

40
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,050
I'm telling you right now dog.
Damn.

41
00:01:30,051 --> 00:01:32,710
It feels good to be a beautiful,

42
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,800
ah,

43
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:41,180
you got out.
He was full on a child's flags at half

44
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:46,550
mast.
Okay.

45
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,250
It's over.
That's all I love to say.

46
00:01:55,251 --> 00:01:56,084
I love you.

47
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:56,970
Hello.
Do you mind?

48
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:57,900
We love you too,
man.

49
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:02,650
Thank you.
He came in and just dropped a bomb right

50
00:02:02,651 --> 00:02:03,870
there.
He's the greatest.

51
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,460
Joey Diaz.
The greatest.

52
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,620
What we need is a food emancipation
proclamation.

53
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:15,480
We need a food emancipation proclamation
to free the food system from the

54
00:02:15,481 --> 00:02:20,481
enslavement of bureaucratic orthodoxy
so that consenting adults,

55
00:02:22,591 --> 00:02:27,591
and I'm choosing my words very carefully
here so that consenting adults could

56
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:32,781
make a voluntary choice of food choice,
the type that they want from the source

57
00:02:35,671 --> 00:02:40,671
that they want.
And if we allowed however many in our

58
00:02:41,071 --> 00:02:46,071
society,
5% 10% 20% whoever didn't come,

59
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:53,960
whoever wanted to opt out of government
sanctioned orthodoxy and say,

60
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,750
hmm,
is there something better out here?

61
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:03,290
Can I choose something different?
If anybody who wanted to opt out of the

62
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:08,680
of the current industrial government
orthodoxy could do so,

63
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:15,390
voluntary consenting adults here,
you know we're talking about the right

64
00:03:15,401 --> 00:03:16,360
of private contract.

65
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,460
If I want to,
if I want to come to your farm

66
00:03:18,461 --> 00:03:20,200
voluntarily,
no extortion here,

67
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:22,870
okay,
voluntarily look around,

68
00:03:22,871 --> 00:03:25,690
smell around,
ask around and I want what you're

69
00:03:25,691 --> 00:03:28,600
producing.
I should be able to get it.

70
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,690
When the government gets between my lips
and my throat,

71
00:03:31,691 --> 00:03:35,020
I call that an invasion of privacy.
And yes,

72
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:39,100
I do also believe that we should
legalize all drugs,

73
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,040
all of them.
Because the government that can tell you

74
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:46,720
you can't smoke dope can also tell you
you can't drink raw milk or,

75
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:47,710
or,
or,

76
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:50,530
or refuse to vaccinate your children or
you know,

77
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:55,590
go down the line.
The fact is that the orthodoxy is so

78
00:03:56,351 --> 00:04:01,351
convoluted now that it's perfectly safe
and fine to feed your kids.

79
00:04:02,321 --> 00:04:06,040
Coca Cola,
mountain dew count Chocula cheerios and

80
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:11,041
pop tarts,
but not homemade charcuterie,

81
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:16,780
pickles,
raw milk and backyard butcher chickens.

82
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,450
Not Crazy.
It's absolutely crazy.

83
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,600
And if we would free up,
I mean I travel a lot.

84
00:04:22,601 --> 00:04:25,060
I talked to thousands and thousands of
farmers.

85
00:04:25,061 --> 00:04:28,480
I just talked to 200 farmers up in San
Jose this weekend.

86
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:31,570
You know,
and what's the limiting factor?

87
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,990
Why is local food cheap?
Why is our kind of food,

88
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,760
I mean cheap,
more expensive,

89
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,140
uh,
that it has to be.

90
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:42,040
Why are we perceived as elitist?
Why isn't it more available?

91
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:44,620
Why is it so hard to find integrity
food?

92
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:50,160
This is the issue.
And if we would free up those of us in

93
00:04:50,381 --> 00:04:55,381
the system that are ready to access our
neighbors with quiche and noodles and

94
00:04:57,491 --> 00:05:00,850
charcuterie and you know a name,
your name,

95
00:05:00,851 --> 00:05:04,540
it to free us up,
it would,

96
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:09,750
it would completely invert the entire
food system in a year.

97
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:14,000
That's what's weird about like bill
o'reilly or the Big Bang theory or any

98
00:05:14,001 --> 00:05:17,090
of those shows,
is they have this perfect opportunity at

99
00:05:17,091 --> 00:05:22,091
any moment to blow people's minds by
just making 180 degree turn just turning

100
00:05:23,361 --> 00:05:27,770
in some complete opposite direction.
Imagine if bill had me direct an episode

101
00:05:27,771 --> 00:05:30,020
of Big Bang theory with no notes.
Yes,

102
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,540
there's going to be a lot of active,
but you'd have to write it to you

103
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,030
couldn't know I can I,
if I,

104
00:05:35,031 --> 00:05:37,010
if I have creative liberties with the
script,

105
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,220
yes,
I can get as many gay teens is.

106
00:05:40,221 --> 00:05:42,200
I want God,
that'd be so fun.

107
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:45,260
That'd be so fun.
If like they had to do that at once a

108
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:48,470
year.
They had to let underground artists edit

109
00:05:48,471 --> 00:05:51,080
and direct their shows just to see what
it would turn into.

110
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,750
Why that would be a terrible idea.
Be Fun.

111
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:55,640
Yeah,
it'd be fun for you,

112
00:05:55,641 --> 00:05:57,950
but just low stakes shows,
sitcoms,

113
00:05:57,951 --> 00:06:01,760
you know it's not low stakes because
imagine if it was your show and then

114
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:04,250
some fucking dj doug pound comes along
and he's like,

115
00:06:04,251 --> 00:06:05,990
I'd like to direct your show for a week
and be like,

116
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:07,010
fuck you man.

117
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,420
We're going to kill your whole cast.
No,

118
00:06:08,421 --> 00:06:09,680
you're not man.
No.

119
00:06:09,681 --> 00:06:11,390
Who wants to watch that shit?
Listen man,

120
00:06:11,391 --> 00:06:14,450
trust me.
Seven 18 it's going to be awesome.

121
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,460
They wake up and it's all a dream
though.

122
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,720
That's the,
that's the caveat.

123
00:06:17,721 --> 00:06:21,650
Blossom becomes a demon.
They all start eating babies.

124
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,830
Baby Salad every day,
but we'll just use like rubber baby

125
00:06:24,831 --> 00:06:26,090
dolls.
Don't worry.

126
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:29,780
But if bill o'reilly came out for one
show in drag

127
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:35,210
and just it's like this is who I am now.
It doesn't really explain it.

128
00:06:35,211 --> 00:06:37,040
Same Guy and he's the same guy.
It's just like,

129
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:40,460
this is who I am.
This is how I've changed deal with it.

130
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:43,280
That would be as big as Geeth.
I'd be as big as Jesus.

131
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:47,350
That is how Jesus will come back.
It will be below right now.

132
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,440
Wilamena we'll Amena o'reilly and he
starts slowly beginning of a

133
00:06:51,441 --> 00:06:53,870
transformation to the female gender.

134
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:54,840
Yeah.
Yeah.

135
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:58,160
That would be incredibly,
it just tells you like the reason why he

136
00:06:58,161 --> 00:06:59,900
was like that.
It's just she was scared,

137
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,530
scared all the time that people find out
that he identifies with being a woman

138
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:06,620
and that's where all the hate came from,
the homophobia,

139
00:07:06,621 --> 00:07:09,100
all the Jesus' love,
all that craziness that was,

140
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,970
he was into.
It was really just,

141
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:14,660
I wanted to be a woman and then he just
starts putting pictures of his news,

142
00:07:14,661 --> 00:07:19,190
surgical crusty below or ile pussy up on
it and people just,

143
00:07:19,191 --> 00:07:22,490
it causes waves of suicide.
But here's what's crazy.

144
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,380
People still spot him out at night,
like dress like a man and he looks

145
00:07:27,381 --> 00:07:30,500
perfectly normal and they realize it's
just a fucking scam.

146
00:07:30,501 --> 00:07:33,260
Like everything else he does.
He's not really becoming a woman.

147
00:07:33,261 --> 00:07:36,650
It's just a bullshit artist.
That would be one of the salvage.

148
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,180
No,
it's what happens is you realize

149
00:07:38,181 --> 00:07:39,290
someone's blackmailing him.

150
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:42,140
You realize somebody has something worse
than that and they're like,

151
00:07:42,141 --> 00:07:42,974
listen,
bill,

152
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:46,040
that's like a house of cards move.
Here's what I want you to do on your

153
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:47,510
show.
What do you think?

154
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:48,650
Oh my God.
You know,

155
00:07:48,651 --> 00:07:51,920
I've got these pictures of you fisting
chimpanzees,

156
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,233
chimps,
water.

157
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,300
I was doing it for Jesus.
So it goes in and tide goes out.

158
00:07:59,301 --> 00:08:04,301
You don't know why it fits chimps
who could explain it?

159
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:13,970
God moves in mysterious ways while their
fist and I to wear a dress.

160
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,420
You fucking Cock sucker.
I'm not wanting to go out.

161
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,670
That's my deal,
my personal life.

162
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:22,070
Eh?
