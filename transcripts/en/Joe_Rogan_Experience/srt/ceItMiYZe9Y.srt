1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:00,923
Hold us.
All the good stuff happens before you 

2
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:04,600
know he's does three,
two,

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:05,673
one.

4
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:08,403
Okay.

5
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:09,221
Dan Carlin,
ladies,

6
00:00:09,221 --> 00:00:10,090
gentlemen.
And we're live.

7
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,230
Hey Dude.
First of all,

8
00:00:11,231 --> 00:00:14,350
thank you so much for this coin.
This coin from Constantine.

9
00:00:14,351 --> 00:00:15,430
You brought me,
uh,

10
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:17,560
how many years old?
1700.

11
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:18,970
That's fucking crazy,
man.

12
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:19,953
It's fun to,
I always say I like giving something 

13
00:00:20,951 --> 00:00:23,680
that is the oldest manmade objects in 
most people's homes.

14
00:00:23,681 --> 00:00:24,514
Maybe not yours.
You'll have some aboriginal instrument 

15
00:00:25,991 --> 00:00:27,370
or something that's like from the Stone 
Age,

16
00:00:27,371 --> 00:00:30,220
but most people that'll be the oldest 
manmade thing in their home.

17
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:32,170
My friend,
Dr.

18
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:34,150
Mark Gordon actually gave me a Roman 
coin as well,

19
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:36,430
but I dunno who's coin is all yours.
Looks older.

20
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,110
I don't know.
That's depressing though.

21
00:00:38,111 --> 00:00:38,944
Cause normally I'm the coin guy so I 
hate that I've been beaten to the punch 

22
00:00:41,321 --> 00:00:43,300
by anybody on that.
Well he's,

23
00:00:43,301 --> 00:00:47,010
he's kind of a historical efficient auto
or a history aficionados.

24
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:50,590
Well not the extent that you are though,
but so this is from Constantine?

25
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:52,450
Yeah,
my wife would spend that by accident.

26
00:00:52,451 --> 00:00:54,730
Just so you know.
Oh,

27
00:00:54,731 --> 00:00:56,800
I got a coffee.
I got a pair of shoes.

28
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:57,700
That's right.
And there were no,

29
00:00:57,701 --> 00:00:58,990
wouldn't buy shoes?
No.

30
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:02,500
W W how much was that worth back then?
Do you know what that's like?

31
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,760
There probably is.
It is.

32
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:06,810
Did they have,
what kind of units do they have?

33
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:07,653
Like A,
they probably had like some dead metal 

34
00:01:08,741 --> 00:01:09,574
type thing and then some kind of bronze 
and then you get into the silver and 

35
00:01:11,621 --> 00:01:14,140
gold and how much is mixed into the rest
and uh,

36
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:15,423
and they have those like you can go and 
it's actually really cool because they 

37
00:01:17,111 --> 00:01:18,550
were better like,
like they'll,

38
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:21,460
they'll clean the silver often it looks 
like yesterday.

39
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,073
So you always know what's the cheap 
stuff when they're all dirty and 

40
00:01:24,791 --> 00:01:25,960
everything like that.
Oh,

41
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:27,580
right.
Because then that's like a penny.

42
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:28,900
Well,
our pennies get the same way.

43
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,370
Right.
What do you think this is made out of?

44
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:31,600
Oh,
some alloy.

45
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:33,430
I Dunno,
they had alloys back then.

46
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:33,971
Oh,
sure.

47
00:01:33,971 --> 00:01:35,560
Electrum was the cool,
when were you mixed?

48
00:01:35,561 --> 00:01:37,040
Gold and silver.
Ooh.

49
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,350
Yeah.
I've never heard of that.

50
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:39,890
Yeah.
Electrum they still have,

51
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:41,221
they still do.
They use it.

52
00:01:41,221 --> 00:01:42,160
If,
I hope I'm right about this,

53
00:01:42,161 --> 00:01:43,240
this is gonna be one of these is on 
twitter.

54
00:01:43,241 --> 00:01:45,120
Can Carly doesn't know what he's talking
about it about electron.

55
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:46,000
It's not bad.
Well,

56
00:01:46,001 --> 00:01:50,920
the beautiful thing about your podcast 
is you can research things in advance so

57
00:01:50,921 --> 00:01:52,210
you know what the fuck you're talking 
about.

58
00:01:52,211 --> 00:01:54,280
By the time you speak when you're 
radically.

59
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:55,360
Yes,
allegedly.

60
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,420
I supposedly,
I have a lot of,

61
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,550
a lot of wiggle room words,
defensive journalism.

62
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:01,493
Yeah,
but the,

63
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,300
I don't have to tell you again,
but I will.

64
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,400
Your,
your podcast is for me,

65
00:02:06,401 --> 00:02:10,990
has been the most educational historical
thing in my entire life.

66
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:12,183
I've never had anything in my life that 
it's taught me more about history than 

67
00:02:15,191 --> 00:02:16,024
hardcore history.
I don't even know how to react when 

68
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:20,650
people say that.
It is the kindest things that you hear.

69
00:02:20,651 --> 00:02:23,260
And I always say the same thing.
I always hope everybody gets a chance in

70
00:02:23,261 --> 00:02:24,094
their lives to have people that they 
admire turning around and telling them 

71
00:02:26,891 --> 00:02:28,900
something like that.
Cause it is the need is feeling.

72
00:02:28,901 --> 00:02:31,120
And when,
when you realize all the crap you put up

73
00:02:31,121 --> 00:02:33,760
with for decades and other jobs and 
other businesses to say,

74
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,470
okay,
I'm 51 or whatever,

75
00:02:35,471 --> 00:02:37,420
and they really like what you do.
You just,

76
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,580
everybody should feel this way.
So I appreciate that though.

77
00:02:39,581 --> 00:02:42,040
You my pleasure and I appreciate you.
You,

78
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,630
you found your niche,
man.

79
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,940
You like,
think about all the other stuff you did,

80
00:02:45,941 --> 00:02:49,960
all the broadcast work you did before.
It really prepared you for this,

81
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:50,794
this podcast,
because obviously this medium is so 

82
00:02:53,651 --> 00:02:56,950
incredibly new and this ability for you 
to just put something out.

83
00:02:56,951 --> 00:02:58,690
I mean,
I see when you put out new podcasts,

84
00:02:58,691 --> 00:03:02,560
they're at the top of the heap of all 
the podcasts in the world.

85
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,720
That's incredible.
When you think about that,

86
00:03:04,721 --> 00:03:06,760
that all you,
it's just you and you have a,

87
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,220
an a guy who helps you with editing 
theoretically.

88
00:03:09,221 --> 00:03:10,990
Yeah.
And that's fucking it.

89
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,400
I mean,
that is amazing.

90
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,533
I mean,
how is that any different from this 

91
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:15,010
empire?
You've this,

92
00:03:15,011 --> 00:03:17,470
cause I'm just talking.
That's all I'm doing too.

93
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,700
But you walk into this place,
you go,

94
00:03:18,701 --> 00:03:19,534
this is,
this is the Joe Rogan's talking has 

95
00:03:20,771 --> 00:03:21,830
built,
yeah,

96
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,290
something,
something along those lines.

97
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,180
Talking to people like you,
but you're right.

98
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,340
I mean I keep trying to remind myself 
because you know,

99
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:28,750
you and I both been doing this a long 
time,

100
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:31,810
got into it pretty,
pretty early on and so for us it doesn't

101
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:33,790
feel new,
but you keep trying to think about,

102
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:34,624
okay,
what's this going to be like in 30 

103
00:03:35,531 --> 00:03:37,060
years,
40 years?

104
00:03:37,061 --> 00:03:39,410
I keep telling everybody that.
What you're seeing now in Mike,

105
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:40,181
my children,
no,

106
00:03:40,181 --> 00:03:41,880
no other world.
I mean in their minds,

107
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:45,190
I tell my oldest all the time at at the 
time you were born,

108
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:48,700
we weren't even texting yet.
That is all since you've come around.

109
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:52,960
So I keep thinking we're at still at the
tip of the tip of the tip of the iceberg

110
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,033
in this era that we're in now.
What's podcasting going to be like when 

111
00:03:56,351 --> 00:03:59,830
whole generations grow up and it's just 
a part of their world and podcasts are a

112
00:03:59,831 --> 00:04:01,390
part of it and it won't even be 
podcasting.

113
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,223
I mean there'll be broadcasting into the
matrix cord in the back of your neck or 

114
00:04:04,751 --> 00:04:05,584
something.
But,

115
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:07,030
but I mean,
we're still at the,

116
00:04:07,031 --> 00:04:07,864
it seems hard for longterm podcasters to
understand that this is still the 

117
00:04:10,871 --> 00:04:13,870
beginning.
It's almost impossible for us to predict

118
00:04:13,871 --> 00:04:17,500
because when you really think about what
we're doing now in terms of like,

119
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,840
like you could put a youtube video right
now,

120
00:04:19,841 --> 00:04:23,800
you could make a video and you could,
it could go viral for whatever reason,

121
00:04:23,801 --> 00:04:27,130
and a million people all over the world 
to be watching your video.

122
00:04:27,131 --> 00:04:29,590
Like almost instantly.
This was not,

123
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:32,170
uh,
not only unheard of 10 years ago.

124
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,180
Just go back 20,
30,

125
00:04:34,181 --> 00:04:35,830
40.
It's insanity.

126
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,020
You're talking insanity.
Like people would be like,

127
00:04:38,021 --> 00:04:40,810
what the fuck are you saying?
You have a phone in your pocket?

128
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,690
That would be insane.
You have a phone in your pocket that has

129
00:04:43,691 --> 00:04:44,524
a camera.

130
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,780
What?
You wait,

131
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,633
don't you have a phone in your pocket?
That's a video camera that takes high 

132
00:04:49,901 --> 00:04:54,760
definition video with stereo sound and 
you can we meet,

133
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:57,640
you're uploading it through the sky just
through the air.

134
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:01,180
What in real time.
Instantaneously.

135
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:03,340
That's insane.
So now think,

136
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,533
what could we be looking at in terms of 
augmented reality in terms of virtual 

137
00:05:08,951 --> 00:05:11,320
reality and working on something along 
those lines.

138
00:05:11,321 --> 00:05:12,060
Right now it's,
it's,

139
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:12,910
it's,
it's crazy.

140
00:05:12,911 --> 00:05:13,690
Yeah.
It's what you doing.

141
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,460
I can't tell you what I'm doing.
Tell me off.

142
00:05:15,461 --> 00:05:15,910
No,
but,

143
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,720
but the point of the podcast up,
the point is,

144
00:05:17,721 --> 00:05:18,430
is that this,
this,

145
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:19,840
you're absolutely right about this 
stuff.

146
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:20,590
And,
and you,

147
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:21,550
you know,
I spent,

148
00:05:21,551 --> 00:05:23,170
before I got into podcasting,
I was in,

149
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,250
uh,
in the era where,

150
00:05:24,251 --> 00:05:25,084
you know,
like Mark Cuban made it big and 

151
00:05:25,751 --> 00:05:28,660
everybody was just going to start a high
tech company and sell it for billions of

152
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:28,690
dollars.

153
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:31,120
What did Cuban make it big with a 
broadcast.com

154
00:05:31,121 --> 00:05:31,520
I think,
which,

155
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,310
which we call it was basically like a 
website with a bunch of links and,

156
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:36,250
and you know,
everybody was like,

157
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,740
Dang,
if he can do so.

158
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,030
So I was in one of these companies with 
a bunch of buddies and we were,

159
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,880
we were pushing what we called amateur 
content back then.

160
00:05:42,881 --> 00:05:44,830
So we're talking 95,
96.

161
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:45,903
And one of my jobs was to go with the 
staff to all these venture capitalists 

162
00:05:49,421 --> 00:05:52,540
and try to sell them on the idea of what
amateur content was going to become.

163
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:53,853
Joe,
we went from like place to place to 

164
00:05:55,301 --> 00:05:57,010
place with all these people who are 
supposedly the,

165
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:59,000
who can see the future and every one of 
them.

166
00:05:59,001 --> 00:05:59,834
And I mean every single one said 
nobody's going to view amateur content 

167
00:06:03,651 --> 00:06:05,810
because if anybody could make anything,
anybody would wanted to see,

168
00:06:05,811 --> 00:06:06,860
they'd be paid for it.

169
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:11,120
And I kept talking about the quantity 
has a quality all its own idea,

170
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:11,751
right?
Where you say,

171
00:06:11,751 --> 00:06:12,584
listen,
if only 1% of this stuff is worth 

172
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:15,074
watching,
you're still going to have millions of 

173
00:06:16,491 --> 00:06:19,580
pieces of content uploaded all the time.
There's going to be good stuff in there.

174
00:06:19,581 --> 00:06:20,930
And they were like,
you.

175
00:06:20,931 --> 00:06:23,900
So you thought this was coming.
It was in some ways.

176
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,730
Well.
Yeah,

177
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:26,600
and it wasn't just because,
um,

178
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,100
you know,
I was in with a bunch of tech people who

179
00:06:28,101 --> 00:06:28,934
understood this too,
but one of them had taken me off the 

180
00:06:30,351 --> 00:06:32,900
radio and said,
we're going to put you on the Internet.

181
00:06:32,901 --> 00:06:35,540
This was in 94.
And I said,

182
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,280
put me on the Internet.
I said,

183
00:06:37,281 --> 00:06:38,450
you know,
we're just learning how to use the,

184
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,380
I said,
what are we going to do?

185
00:06:39,381 --> 00:06:39,950
And you just,
well,

186
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:40,783
I'm going to invent the,
the way to do this and you going to be 

187
00:06:43,161 --> 00:06:44,420
the test person,
right.

188
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,680
That shows everybody,
hey,

189
00:06:45,681 --> 00:06:47,270
you could,
so that fell through.

190
00:06:47,271 --> 00:06:48,590
But once that happened,
I was,

191
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,970
you know,
it was in the back of my head going,

192
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,013
okay,
someday we might be able to do this on 

193
00:06:51,861 --> 00:06:53,060
the Internet,
that kind of thing.

194
00:06:53,061 --> 00:06:53,631
But,
but the,

195
00:06:53,631 --> 00:06:56,030
the point was is that these people do 
venture capital meetings.

196
00:06:56,031 --> 00:06:59,030
All these hardcore guys were inventing 
our future and funding it.

197
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,550
None of them saw this amateur content.
Then coming,

198
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,610
there was one thing that they were doing
quite a long time ago.

199
00:07:04,611 --> 00:07:05,444
There was like some Internet radio 
channel because they had tried to put 

200
00:07:08,391 --> 00:07:09,224
together and you know,
they had funded it and spend a bunch of 

201
00:07:11,661 --> 00:07:12,494
money on,
they hired a bunch of people to do it 

202
00:07:13,401 --> 00:07:15,830
and Bobby Slayton was actually one of 
the,

203
00:07:15,831 --> 00:07:16,664
uh,
the online broadcasters and I did his 

204
00:07:18,381 --> 00:07:19,214
show and he didn't know and he was 
talking about how they were having a 

205
00:07:21,021 --> 00:07:25,400
hard time keeping it up and wasn't 
catching on the way they wanted to.

206
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,950
They were just a little bit ahead of 
your head too far.

207
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:30,920
I read somewhere too,
cause I was actually sort of researching

208
00:07:30,921 --> 00:07:33,140
the history of what we do and what the 
precursors were.

209
00:07:33,141 --> 00:07:33,974
And I guess there were audio blogs and 
stuff that some really high tech types 

210
00:07:37,311 --> 00:07:41,330
where we're pursuing in the 90s also.
And maybe even the late eighties where,

211
00:07:41,331 --> 00:07:42,164
you know,
they're like send in full files to each 

212
00:07:43,371 --> 00:07:44,690
other or something.
But you know,

213
00:07:44,691 --> 00:07:45,524
it's funny because somebody is going to 
write a book someday about the history 

214
00:07:47,451 --> 00:07:49,580
of this and how it got started and all 
that kind of stuff.

215
00:07:49,581 --> 00:07:50,414
And it's crazy to think about that.
We're actually due to sort of a 

216
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,100
serendipity.
Good,

217
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:59,240
good timing sense that here we are,
like I said in the first 10 years,

218
00:07:59,241 --> 00:08:02,150
15 years of of what's not just going to 
be a phenomenon,

219
00:08:02,151 --> 00:08:02,984
but it's going to be a huge part I think
of the future world that people grow up 

220
00:08:05,271 --> 00:08:07,490
and not our show specifically but,
but,

221
00:08:07,491 --> 00:08:10,250
but this world we're creating,
I mean everyone's a broadcast or now.

222
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,780
Yeah.
And look,

223
00:08:11,781 --> 00:08:14,600
anyone could have been,
I mean there's been a lot of barriers to

224
00:08:14,601 --> 00:08:16,460
keep people that are really talented,
interesting,

225
00:08:16,461 --> 00:08:18,950
funny people from getting their stuff 
out there.

226
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,560
And that thing was like always like they
didn't know how to start.

227
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,990
How do I like how do I become a standup 
comedian enough to,

228
00:08:23,991 --> 00:08:27,020
I've talked to so many funny guys and 
they just go,

229
00:08:27,021 --> 00:08:28,100
wow,
how do I get started?

230
00:08:28,101 --> 00:08:28,934
I'm like,
well you got to go sign up at an open 

231
00:08:29,721 --> 00:08:31,160
mic night and like,
ah,

232
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,870
to seems too much.
And the,

233
00:08:32,871 --> 00:08:33,704
the idea of it is too daunting.
But if you just sit in front of a 

234
00:08:36,381 --> 00:08:38,090
camera,
that's all you have to do.

235
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,040
Turn your cell phone on and start 
talking.

236
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,053
Here's what I think about Donald Trump.
That is what I think about Harvey 

237
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,373
Weinstein.
All you have to do is have a unique 

238
00:08:46,341 --> 00:08:46,610
take.

239
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:47,870
Be Funny,
be interesting,

240
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:50,900
somehow engaging.
And it doesn't even have to be visual.

241
00:08:50,901 --> 00:08:51,560
I mean,
God,

242
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,393
there's a hundred maybe more really 
funny what I would call twitter 

243
00:08:55,981 --> 00:08:56,814
comedians that just save funny shit.
They write funny shit on twitter and 

244
00:09:00,811 --> 00:09:03,930
they have huge followings because of it.
I always say,

245
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:05,003
you know,
you try to look at what the brick and 

246
00:09:05,881 --> 00:09:09,070
mortar analog version of this was before
this came around.

247
00:09:09,071 --> 00:09:11,370
And Remember Mc Hammer was selling,
you know,

248
00:09:11,371 --> 00:09:12,204
cassette tapes of his music out of the,
out of his hatchback at the Oakland a's 

249
00:09:14,851 --> 00:09:15,684
games or,
or I think of like Eddie Murphy or 

250
00:09:17,371 --> 00:09:19,200
Richard Pryor.
These people who are just,

251
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,640
they're so funny that you could put them
on a crappily recorded cassette tape and

252
00:09:23,641 --> 00:09:25,680
it wouldn't make any difference.
And I,

253
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:26,523
and I remember Eddie Murphy saying 
something about if he hadn't gotten on 

254
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:29,034
Saturday night live,
he doesn't know how he would of how he 

255
00:09:30,721 --> 00:09:32,220
would have exposed himself to the 
public.

256
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:33,181
Well,
these days,

257
00:09:33,181 --> 00:09:36,870
if you're that funny and you put that on
audio and you put it out there,

258
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:38,210
you will,
you know,

259
00:09:38,211 --> 00:09:39,044
know you no longer need the facilitator,
the gatekeeper to open the doors for 

260
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:43,530
you.
You have a wide open,

261
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:44,281
um,
uh,

262
00:09:44,281 --> 00:09:44,791
Mike,
you know,

263
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:47,670
you called it open Mike Nights.
This is open mic night for the world,

264
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:48,504
right?
Yeah.

265
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:50,160
Every country.
It's fucking crazy.

266
00:09:50,161 --> 00:09:50,994
There's some kid who's 20 years old.
They bought a house in my neighborhood 

267
00:09:52,831 --> 00:09:56,370
for $9 million or $7 million.
$7 million.

268
00:09:56,371 --> 00:09:58,980
I'm fucking youtube kid.
I was reading about it today.

269
00:09:58,981 --> 00:10:00,780
I weigh what?
He's 20.

270
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:04,380
He bought a $7 million fucking house.
I was like,

271
00:10:04,381 --> 00:10:07,350
this is insane.
Don't even pull it up enough of him.

272
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,190
No,
I was,

273
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,470
I was at Youtube Youtube about a month 
ago.

274
00:10:10,471 --> 00:10:11,304
I did a speaking engagement at Google 
and across the street in New York above 

275
00:10:13,501 --> 00:10:15,780
the Camden market.
They own the whole building.

276
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,510
So they take me up there,
I get the six hour tour and at one point

277
00:10:18,511 --> 00:10:22,620
they have on a wall with all these 
youtube stars on it and you know,

278
00:10:22,621 --> 00:10:24,080
I'm old,
so there's one or two.

279
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:24,631
So I go,
okay,

280
00:10:24,631 --> 00:10:28,470
that's lady Gaga I guess.
And there's a bunch of like 20 year olds

281
00:10:28,471 --> 00:10:29,131
and they're going,
oh,

282
00:10:29,131 --> 00:10:31,500
this guy has a bazillion followers.
And I'm looking at him going,

283
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,360
really?
I mean at his age,

284
00:10:33,361 --> 00:10:34,194
I don't know what the Hell I was doing.
I was taking a year off college or 

285
00:10:36,241 --> 00:10:37,074
something.
But it's all these kids with multiple 

286
00:10:38,311 --> 00:10:39,144
piercings and tattoos and face stuff and
they're all the Google people were 

287
00:10:41,851 --> 00:10:42,211
telling me,
Oh,

288
00:10:42,211 --> 00:10:43,044
these people are all huge giant.
He's come in with their entourages and 

289
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,000
that's great.
Yeah,

290
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:48,023
some kid just died.
He was 21 and saw in the paper these 

291
00:10:50,671 --> 00:10:52,200
tattoos and I was like,
what the fuck is this kid?

292
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,770
Well he said giant Youtube Star,
some Youtube Rep star.

293
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,090
Do you know?
Did you know who he was?

294
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,960
I've heard the name.
I didn't know.

295
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,780
See you're,
you're young Jamie,

296
00:11:00,781 --> 00:11:02,700
but you're actually all taught these 
young folks,

297
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:03,481
hey,
hey,

298
00:11:03,481 --> 00:11:04,410
calm down.
How old are you?

299
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:06,540
Uh,
34 that's old to these yarn.

300
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,080
Trust.
Anybody over 30?

301
00:11:08,081 --> 00:11:09,210
It wasn't that the line.
Yeah,

302
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,570
that was back in the day.
Right,

303
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,790
but the 30s,
forties,

304
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:13,680
the new 30 so you know,
everything changes.

305
00:11:13,681 --> 00:11:14,514
So what the fuck am I dirt like dirt 
still at the top of the of the iceberg 

306
00:11:19,051 --> 00:11:19,884
though,
doing the ahead of the game and 

307
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,400
everybody,
this whole thing,

308
00:11:23,401 --> 00:11:24,234
what we're experiencing now I think is 
the top of the iceberg because I think 

309
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:28,403
there's some shit that's coming down the
pipe that is going to blow all this out 

310
00:11:31,651 --> 00:11:34,050
of the water and the idea of just 
listening to things,

311
00:11:34,051 --> 00:11:35,040
it's going to be ridiculous.

312
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,873
It's going to be so surface.
I really believe like what you were 

313
00:11:37,561 --> 00:11:40,080
saying about some sort of a matrix 
plugin.

314
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:40,890
You can,
my friend,

315
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:43,710
my friend Dunkin has one of those htc 
vives.

316
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,410
If you've ever seen those,
those you mean virtual reality?

317
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:47,700
Yeah.
You put the helmet on.

318
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:49,620
I have one.
You have one of those as well.

319
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,150
Part of the part of the Gig I'm working 
on.

320
00:11:51,151 --> 00:11:51,631
Yeah.
Oh,

321
00:11:51,631 --> 00:11:53,170
you want to talk about it?
They sent it to me.

322
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:55,180
They sent it to me and I'll tell you 
what's cool.

323
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:57,580
I didn't want to interrupt your story.
You go have been a change as well.

324
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,850
Google earth is on the the virtual 
reality thing,

325
00:12:00,851 --> 00:12:01,571
right,
and they just,

326
00:12:01,571 --> 00:12:04,240
and they just started,
they just put out a new,

327
00:12:04,241 --> 00:12:05,440
I think it's a new update.
Don't go.

328
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:06,850
I'm old so don't quote me on this,
but,

329
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:10,360
but the update allows you now to zoom in
at the ground level now.

330
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,310
It's not virtual reality at the ground 
level.

331
00:12:12,311 --> 00:12:15,910
It's more like your in the photograph,
but it's really cool.

332
00:12:15,911 --> 00:12:17,740
I I,
it was just a week ago I went to all the

333
00:12:17,741 --> 00:12:20,670
homes I grew up in as a kid and went 
back to Jamie's.

334
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:21,750
Yeah.
He said,

335
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,710
this is how it always looked,
even like a year ago,

336
00:12:23,711 --> 00:12:27,870
but now you can zoom into the ground and
there's people around you at all these,

337
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:32,560
it's truly awesome.
I have spent sane and it's only going to

338
00:12:32,561 --> 00:12:34,450
be better.
They'll actually at some point have real

339
00:12:34,451 --> 00:12:37,120
virtual reality on the ground.
Anywhere you want to go.

340
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,650
This is insane.
Well,

341
00:12:38,651 --> 00:12:40,390
that's what I think is going to come up 
next.

342
00:12:40,391 --> 00:12:44,260
I think we're going to have it set up 
where like this podcast,

343
00:12:44,261 --> 00:12:47,110
you'll be able to put on some goggles 
like this lady is wearing here.

344
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,600
You're gonna be able to put up some 
goggles.

345
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,920
You're going to be in this room with us.
You'll be behind me.

346
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:53,560
You'll be staring at my butt.
You'll do whatever the fuck you want.

347
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,300
You'd be in the room.
You know what I'm saying?

348
00:12:55,301 --> 00:12:57,340
You will.
You will be like a Sim game,

349
00:12:57,341 --> 00:12:58,900
but you're in it.
That's common,

350
00:12:58,901 --> 00:12:59,501
man.
This is,

351
00:12:59,501 --> 00:13:04,501
this whole thing is going to feel so two
d and flat and archaic and just a decade

352
00:13:05,501 --> 00:13:06,334
or so.
Everybody's waiting though for the big 

353
00:13:07,301 --> 00:13:09,550
seat.
It's funny how you wait for,

354
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:10,490
you know it.
It's,

355
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:12,180
you know how technology is adopted,
right?

356
00:13:12,181 --> 00:13:14,140
You don't buy the computer just to have 
the computer,

357
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,810
some new game or some new new ability 
comes you,

358
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:17,621
oh,
I got to do that.

359
00:13:17,621 --> 00:13:18,910
Well,
I guess I need a computer for that.

360
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:21,400
Everybody's waiting for that and the 
virtual reality room to what's,

361
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:22,323
what's the must have thing that then 
next Christmas everybody's got to have 

362
00:13:25,391 --> 00:13:27,190
the virtual reality set up under the 
tree for,

363
00:13:27,191 --> 00:13:27,580
you know.

364
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,413
Well I think one of the things that 
setting android ahead of the curve in 

365
00:13:30,971 --> 00:13:34,330
terms of like android versus apple as 
these android phones,

366
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:38,570
they slide into these headsets now and 
they act as virtual reality screen.

367
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,370
Like a low level one.
Yeah.

368
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,940
Not that bad man.
No,

369
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,490
I haven't seen it,
but they,

370
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,850
you know,
they told me again,

371
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,170
they um,
that,

372
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,340
that the overlords,
yes,

373
00:13:48,341 --> 00:13:50,940
the overlords.
I understand the mushroom overlords.

374
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:52,360
That's what I heard earlier.
Um,

375
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:53,830
but,
but uh,

376
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:55,290
but no,
they were telling me that,

377
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:59,200
that the I phones from apple also are 
built for that capability.

378
00:13:59,201 --> 00:14:01,300
They just haven't introduced the add ons
that you would need.

379
00:14:01,301 --> 00:14:03,760
But in terms of the power that they've 
put in there,

380
00:14:03,761 --> 00:14:06,280
they built it for that so it can scale 
up.

381
00:14:06,281 --> 00:14:07,114
Eventually.
He just pulled it going to be talking 

382
00:14:08,111 --> 00:14:09,000
out of my rear.
Right.

383
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:09,950
You got it right there.

384
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:10,783
Apple reportedly readying standalone Ar,
which is augmented reality headset for 

385
00:14:15,671 --> 00:14:18,310
2019 well,
hey fuck face,

386
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:21,250
that's a year and a half away from now.
You fucking assholes.

387
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,380
When is this going to hit you?
That's what no one knows.

388
00:14:23,381 --> 00:14:27,100
And everybody's afraid to put money 
forward and not and be too early.

389
00:14:27,101 --> 00:14:29,020
Like you were just talking about.
Hold on.

390
00:14:29,021 --> 00:14:33,160
Look at this.
The device would run r o s apples,

391
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,440
reality operating system.
See,

392
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,480
that's the fucking Matrix,
man.

393
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,640
This is what everybody was worried about
with google,

394
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,670
that Google was skynet.
Google has your email,

395
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:45,310
google.
Some people were using google voice.

396
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:47,770
People use Google maps.
You,

397
00:14:47,771 --> 00:14:48,604
I mean there's,
there's so much now that you're 

398
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:51,883
connected to with this one company.
If they come out with some crazy 

399
00:14:54,111 --> 00:14:58,130
augmented reality thing and then you 
like tap into that as well,

400
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,050
but everybody wants you in their 
environment,

401
00:15:00,051 --> 00:15:00,884
right?
Or I want you in the closed environment 

402
00:15:01,841 --> 00:15:02,571
so that,
I mean,

403
00:15:02,571 --> 00:15:07,180
it's funny how the old aol model is,
is similar now to what they still,

404
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,230
facebook never wants you to have to 
leave facebook.

405
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:11,240
Google wants you to be googled all the 
time.

406
00:15:11,241 --> 00:15:14,090
I mean old,
they keep me with the imessage.

407
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:18,530
I tried switching over to a Google Pixel
about a year ago for two days.

408
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:19,813
It was so bad,
like trying to get people to message me 

409
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,540
like I would text people.
Did you get it?

410
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:24,470
No.
Did you get it?

411
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,670
No.
Send me a text.

412
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,660
I didn't get it.
Fuck.

413
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:28,460
And that'd be calling them back.
Did you send it?

414
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:29,420
Yeah,
I didn't get it.

415
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,680
It says it's centered.
Okay,

416
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:31,750
hold on.
I'm gonna send you one tone.

417
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,170
You get it.
He didn't get it.

418
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:34,250
Did you get it?
No.

419
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:35,930
Fuck.
So what do you got to do?

420
00:15:35,931 --> 00:15:38,960
So then I go online.
You have to go to the apple.

421
00:15:38,961 --> 00:15:42,350
I messaged servers and have your email 
removed.

422
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,580
Okay,
I'll go and do that.

423
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,960
Nothing.
I was like,

424
00:15:44,961 --> 00:15:47,630
fuck this.
And then I talk to people online like,

425
00:15:47,631 --> 00:15:48,530
what's the best way to do this?

426
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,390
They go,
you gotta change your number or watts.

427
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,160
So if you want to try to use an android 
phone,

428
00:15:52,161 --> 00:15:53,360
you have to change your phone number.
I'm like,

429
00:15:53,361 --> 00:15:54,170
all right,
fuck it.

430
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:56,720
I went right back to apple.
I was like,

431
00:15:56,721 --> 00:15:58,460
I don't have time for this.
This is like,

432
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:01,170
this is too much noodling around high.
Now.

433
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:02,443
One problem with a password these days 
can occupy your whole day trying to 

434
00:16:05,151 --> 00:16:06,260
figure out the problem.
So I mean,

435
00:16:06,261 --> 00:16:07,490
I had it with the email.
I,

436
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:11,330
I didn't know Yahoo Mail was down.
So I'm thinking it's my problem.

437
00:16:11,331 --> 00:16:12,890
So I'm spending the whole day working on
it.

438
00:16:12,891 --> 00:16:14,000
I'm changing passwords,
look,

439
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:14,991
find out.
At the end of the day,

440
00:16:14,991 --> 00:16:15,824
no,
Yahoo was just down all those past 

441
00:16:16,431 --> 00:16:17,264
rigid,
you'd have to do any of that and it's 

442
00:16:18,011 --> 00:16:18,844
screwed up.
Everything that Yad before and I'm 51 

443
00:16:21,141 --> 00:16:22,400
that's what happens when you get old.
Well,

444
00:16:22,401 --> 00:16:25,400
I got a Mac book and I got a phone call 
in my book.

445
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:26,180
Yeah,
me too.

446
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,013
What is this bullshit?
I updated something and all of a sudden 

447
00:16:30,021 --> 00:16:32,390
my laptop started ringing and I'm like,
no,

448
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:32,961
no,
no,

449
00:16:32,961 --> 00:16:33,530
no,
no.

450
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:34,760
We're not doing this.
No,

451
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,500
I'm not doing this.
Ask my children.

452
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:37,663
I'm at the point now where I'm literally
asking my teenage children for help and 

453
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:41,623
that to me is a sign right there.
It's the first sign that eventually 

454
00:16:43,821 --> 00:16:46,310
leads you into that home that they put 
you in.

455
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:47,323
You know what I mean?
This is the first step towards my 

456
00:16:48,261 --> 00:16:49,340
children going,
oh my God,

457
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,530
my father.
You know what's bizarre man?

458
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,140
My kids,
they just figure shit out.

459
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,910
Like if you give a kid,
it's,

460
00:16:55,911 --> 00:16:58,940
it's amazing how intuitive some of these
APP creators are.

461
00:16:58,941 --> 00:17:00,530
Absolutely.
Because my eye,

462
00:17:00,531 --> 00:17:03,950
my nine year old,
she started making these little movies.

463
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:06,620
She's got this little editing thing on 
our ipad.

464
00:17:06,621 --> 00:17:07,610
My 12 year old does it too.

465
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:08,443
So she's filming little scenes.
She splices them all together and then 

466
00:17:11,061 --> 00:17:13,730
she adds music and text to it.
And then she goes,

467
00:17:13,731 --> 00:17:14,570
Daddy,
you want to see the movie?

468
00:17:14,571 --> 00:17:15,220
I mean,
I went,

469
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,380
what the fuck are you doing?
Good.

470
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:19,300
And it's good,
weird.

471
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:20,360
You know what?
You know what though?

472
00:17:20,361 --> 00:17:21,830
I mean,
from a creative standpoint,

473
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,370
it's so easy.
Um,

474
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,253
and,
and I tend to have a personality that 

475
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:25,874
does this.
Any way to look at the negative 

476
00:17:26,721 --> 00:17:27,950
Dystopian,
Ya know,

477
00:17:27,951 --> 00:17:29,450
things that can happen.
The big brother things,

478
00:17:29,451 --> 00:17:30,830
which is totally the way I see the 
world.

479
00:17:30,831 --> 00:17:31,460
But,
um,

480
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:34,340
but my kids,
when I look at the creativity,

481
00:17:34,341 --> 00:17:35,174
so in my family,
I come from a family of people who 

482
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:37,910
worked in film.
And so when I was a kid,

483
00:17:37,911 --> 00:17:38,744
I had a super eight camera.
I had the old editing setup dance 

484
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,430
licensed by,
I used to make a little space videos and

485
00:17:43,431 --> 00:17:44,264
I figured out you scratch the film with 
a needle frame after frame and you can 

486
00:17:46,641 --> 00:17:47,570
make laser beams.

487
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:48,830
And so when I was a kid,
I did that.

488
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,040
So like you said,
my,

489
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,680
my daughter comes up,
it was only two weeks ago and she's,

490
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:55,560
she's taken all of her school plays that
she's done.

491
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:56,603
She's taken scenes out of them,
she's backed it with music and she's 

492
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:02,010
turned it into like a movie promo that 
you see at the beginning of the theater.

493
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:05,880
And I'm looking at this and I'm going,
this is so dang creative.

494
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:08,820
And it's made,
you know how hard it would have been for

495
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:10,830
her to get a super eight camera and the 
editing device.

496
00:18:10,831 --> 00:18:11,221
We,
I mean,

497
00:18:11,221 --> 00:18:12,054
this,
this makes it available to all these 

498
00:18:14,311 --> 00:18:15,900
people.
And so theoretically,

499
00:18:15,901 --> 00:18:18,690
if it doesn't go the Dan Carlin 
dystopian blade runner way,

500
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:19,853
it could easily be like this and this is
how I used to sell the the amateur 

501
00:18:22,531 --> 00:18:23,364
content to the venture capitalists in 
the nineties by saying it's going to be 

502
00:18:25,231 --> 00:18:26,064
a creativity revolution and Joe Rogan's 
nine year old is already taking part in 

503
00:18:29,131 --> 00:18:30,900
it and you're not even sure how she did 
it.

504
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,420
That's how we know we're have no idea.
I watched her do it.

505
00:18:33,421 --> 00:18:34,560
Mike,
how are you doing this?

506
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:36,510
Who taught you how to do this?
Because I figured it out.

507
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:39,450
You figured it out.
You just figured it out because God,

508
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:41,130
he just put destiny into that.
My Blah blah blah blah,

509
00:18:41,131 --> 00:18:41,700
blah,
blah.

510
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,820
She's like,
you want to do one?

511
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:43,654
Let's do one.
Like you can do them fast and slow mo 

512
00:18:46,201 --> 00:18:48,270
and all these different little effects 
he could put on it.

513
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:49,463
Do you remember the old days when you 
have two vhs tapes to trying to do this 

514
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:54,203
and you would press one on record and 
the other one I'm planning you would 

515
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:58,590
record from each other?
Yes.

516
00:18:58,591 --> 00:19:02,220
And it worked about 50% of the time.
It was like the cuts were so obvious,

517
00:19:02,221 --> 00:19:05,640
like the cuts and scenes,
it was never seamless.

518
00:19:05,641 --> 00:19:09,860
There was always like this big fucking 
digital fas in between the scenes aspect

519
00:19:09,861 --> 00:19:12,450
of something that you and I were talking
about when we first started here.

520
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:14,670
So it's,
it's what the technology can do.

521
00:19:14,671 --> 00:19:16,110
So like I'm straight,
if you're out there,

522
00:19:16,111 --> 00:19:17,310
you're going to hear me talk about this.
Now,

523
00:19:17,311 --> 00:19:18,144
this may be a personal one to one 
conversation with someone in your 

524
00:19:20,431 --> 00:19:21,264
audience,
but somebody did something that is both 

525
00:19:22,741 --> 00:19:25,740
flattering and absolutely terrifying to 
me recently.

526
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:29,190
Um,
they went and they said it took hundreds

527
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:30,023
of hours and they called a ton of my 
shows and they made little clips of all 

528
00:19:34,561 --> 00:19:35,394
the things I said and then rearrange 
them and created an absolutely new show 

529
00:19:39,601 --> 00:19:42,150
about politics.
Unfortunately with me.

530
00:19:42,151 --> 00:19:45,120
And you cannot tell that they've cut 
this thing 9,000

531
00:19:45,121 --> 00:19:48,810
different times,
but it's my voice saying a whole show of

532
00:19:48,811 --> 00:19:51,190
political stuff that I never said made 
up.

533
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,633
He said,
the guy said it took him hundreds of 

534
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:54,101
hours.
Oh,

535
00:19:54,101 --> 00:19:55,290
he's crazy.
Yeah.

536
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:56,970
But you turn around and you go,
okay,

537
00:19:56,971 --> 00:19:58,270
somebody is going to take a little tie.

538
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,103
And he had at the beginning,
this is not Dan Carlin really saying 

539
00:20:00,391 --> 00:20:01,224
this,
but some guys going to take like some 

540
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:02,843
obscure weird segment,
put it on the Internet and I'm going to 

541
00:20:04,441 --> 00:20:06,180
be chasing,
you know that group going,

542
00:20:06,181 --> 00:20:06,841
no,
it's not me.

543
00:20:06,841 --> 00:20:07,674
That guy didn't,
well you don't even have to do that 

544
00:20:08,611 --> 00:20:09,870
anymore.
If it's just audio.

545
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,840
What they're doing now is you could take
40 hours of audio,

546
00:20:12,841 --> 00:20:15,750
which obviously you and I both have way 
more than that.

547
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,793
They take that 40 hours of audio and 
they can essentially have you say 

548
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,080
anything,
anything ever.

549
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:24,390
So is that going to get us out of,
this is the conversation we had.

550
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:26,190
So can you say to somebody when they 
say,

551
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:29,100
I heard Dan Carlin said he's all for 
child molesting all this clip.

552
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,300
Can you say,
hey,

553
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:31,590
hey,
that's not me.

554
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:33,660
And look there,
there's all this stuff out there.

555
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,553
I mean,
is it gonna?

556
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,393
Is that gonna get you out of trouble or 
a CNN gonna run that story and you'll 

557
00:20:37,471 --> 00:20:38,304
never be able to whack a mole your way 
out of once they understand that that 

558
00:20:40,951 --> 00:20:41,784
technology is available,
they're going to have to be at least 

559
00:20:43,471 --> 00:20:45,570
questioning the source of it.
But if they don't,

560
00:20:45,571 --> 00:20:47,980
you just see the shit out of him,
but I don't think they're going to

561
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,150
jump on.
It's sort of like photo shopping.

562
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:51,163
I'm shopping.
Do you remember when Oscar de la Hoya 

563
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:57,610
got caught wearing fish nets and high 
heeled shoes with boxing gloves on?

564
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:58,563
He was coked up and he was hanging 
around with some crazy rush and 

565
00:21:00,371 --> 00:21:01,204
strippers and he was having a good old 
time and just thought it was fun to 

566
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:05,680
dress up like a girl.
And you know,

567
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:06,514
I thought it was funny,
but he was very deeply embarrassed by 

568
00:21:09,431 --> 00:21:11,320
it.
Obviously he's Mexican,

569
00:21:11,321 --> 00:21:15,580
so Latino boxing fans were not taken 
very kindly to that.

570
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:16,660
So he just said,
look,

571
00:21:16,661 --> 00:21:18,490
that shits fake.
It's been photoshop.

572
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,510
Perfect.
Yeah,

573
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:20,530
look at it.
There he is.

574
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,470
Look,
how do we know that's Oscar Dela.

575
00:21:23,471 --> 00:21:25,670
He's having a good time.
He's wearing a wig and one of them and a

576
00:21:25,671 --> 00:21:26,504
hat they were thinking about is the,
is the left hook to the liver that 

577
00:21:30,311 --> 00:21:31,144
Bernard Hopkins hit him with,
put him down on the deck and I think 

578
00:21:34,031 --> 00:21:36,940
about him beating up Julio,
Cesar Chavez where all the Mexicans were

579
00:21:36,941 --> 00:21:37,880
mad at him.
[inaudible]

580
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,013
prime.
Is that the girl that he was with go 

581
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:41,330
above that.
The,

582
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,360
the two pictures with him and the girl?
Yeah.

583
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:46,180
Is that the girl that turned to been 
keep an eye on that bitch.

584
00:21:46,181 --> 00:21:48,190
If you're going to get a lap dance,
she's going to tell people.

585
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,980
She was like,
guess I guess they uh,

586
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:54,100
she,
that's her right there.

587
00:21:54,101 --> 00:21:54,934
I guess that looks,
Photoshop does look sort of photoshop 

588
00:21:57,531 --> 00:22:01,030
and I'm not gladly because it's his body
means always an athlete's body,

589
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:04,300
but he's wearing a skirt and look,
they were partying.

590
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:06,520
He's having a good fucking time.
We thought it was silly to play.

591
00:22:06,521 --> 00:22:09,640
Dress up.
What the fuck you mean?

592
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:12,250
Look at the one in the upper right 
though and he's bending over.

593
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:14,860
Look at that one.
That one's rough weight of it.

594
00:22:14,861 --> 00:22:15,694
So could you see,
it almost seems to me that it's the 

595
00:22:16,811 --> 00:22:19,840
perfect cover cause now you could do 
anything you wanted to.

596
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,673
I mean if it's,
if it's the Clinton years in office and 

597
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:23,500
bill cleanse,
I can do anything you wanted to just hit

598
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,940
it's photoshop.
That's not me.

599
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:28,750
You kind of can,
but they can tell they can sorta towel.

600
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,870
If you have an expert look at it,
they can break it down sort of.

601
00:22:30,871 --> 00:22:31,704
Yeah.
But there's a lot of the problem is all 

602
00:22:33,581 --> 00:22:37,750
you have to do is have a few people say 
it's real and then a few people say it's

603
00:22:37,751 --> 00:22:39,700
fake.
And the people that want it to be real.

604
00:22:39,701 --> 00:22:40,860
That's exactly right.
Yeah.

605
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,753
And how do you chase it down?
I mean you would constantly be one step 

606
00:22:44,981 --> 00:22:47,050
behind.
It's even this way.

607
00:22:47,051 --> 00:22:50,050
Like I was talking about piracy earlier 
and trying,

608
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:51,183
you know I have a,
I have these old line advisors who will 

609
00:22:52,841 --> 00:22:53,674
say things like,
you need to be charging for your new 

610
00:22:54,671 --> 00:22:56,120
shows and not and more money into it.

611
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:58,660
And I sit there and go,
our competition is piracy,

612
00:22:58,661 --> 00:22:59,494
man.
I mean you got to make everything so 

613
00:23:00,611 --> 00:23:03,580
cheap and guilt amounts of that.
They don't want to go pirate your stuff.

614
00:23:03,581 --> 00:23:04,510
They feel but,
but,

615
00:23:04,511 --> 00:23:05,350
but the,
the,

616
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:09,070
the idea of um,
I'm forgetting where I told him,

617
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:09,963
I told you this was going to happen.
Didn't have any shopping your moments 

618
00:23:12,251 --> 00:23:13,270
now.
Um,

619
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:14,100
yeah,
I mean,

620
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:14,933
uh,
well we had it with Obama's birth 

621
00:23:16,271 --> 00:23:17,104
certificate or something like that.
The Obama birth certificate was a real 

622
00:23:19,301 --> 00:23:20,134
issue because there was people that were
examining it and they say they were 

623
00:23:22,091 --> 00:23:24,100
going putting it through photoshop.
They go and look,

624
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,830
this is clearly fake.
Look,

625
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:27,693
here's the filters.
You can see how it's been added and 

626
00:23:29,021 --> 00:23:29,854
edited.
But then you had a bunch of people that 

627
00:23:30,821 --> 00:23:32,680
were actually photoshop experts say,
no,

628
00:23:32,681 --> 00:23:33,610
no,
no dip shit.

629
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:35,920
This is how photoshop breaks down 
images.

630
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,920
It breaks them down into layers.
This isn't fake.

631
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:42,730
Like this is the actual image and this 
is how photoshop process is.

632
00:23:42,731 --> 00:23:43,820
Images.
And so,

633
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,673
but it didn't matter.
All it took was enough people to show 

634
00:23:47,631 --> 00:23:50,600
you the original photoshop image and 
say,

635
00:23:50,601 --> 00:23:52,910
look,
here's why when we put it in photoshop,

636
00:23:52,911 --> 00:23:53,744
you see all these layers,
clearly it's fake and then they just 

637
00:23:55,671 --> 00:23:56,504
fucking run with it.
They just run with it on their online 

638
00:23:58,431 --> 00:23:59,264
forums and on there they got the little 
twitter group of right wing people that 

639
00:24:02,331 --> 00:24:03,164
want to think that Obama's at Kenyan 
Muslim who's a some sort of Manchurian 

640
00:24:06,021 --> 00:24:08,690
candidate and there was a lot of that 
going on,

641
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:13,010
but when I talked to people like Red 
Band who actually understands photoshop,

642
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:13,340
he,
he's like,

643
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,173
no,
this is what happens when you put an 

644
00:24:15,381 --> 00:24:16,214
image in photoshop.
It breaks it down into layers like it 

645
00:24:18,561 --> 00:24:22,520
shows you how this is how you would edit
something in photoshop.

646
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,640
I think the point you made earlier when 
you started talking about that though is

647
00:24:25,641 --> 00:24:29,060
the key one,
which is if you want to believe this,

648
00:24:29,061 --> 00:24:29,894
here's your evidence and you're going to
ignore it and if you don't want to the 

649
00:24:32,121 --> 00:24:34,700
opposite.
I wrote a piece that never got published

650
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:37,340
in the late eighties called the death of
objective truth.

651
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:38,503
And I thought at the time that this was 
because you couldn't have arguments 

652
00:24:40,971 --> 00:24:43,730
anymore because no one would accept your
source if you said,

653
00:24:43,731 --> 00:24:44,564
okay,
the New York Times said this when I was 

654
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:47,570
a kid.
That was the starting point.

655
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,051
Right.
Okay.

656
00:24:48,051 --> 00:24:49,280
If the New York Times says this,
okay,

657
00:24:49,281 --> 00:24:50,114
we both believe it,
now we can have a conversation about 

658
00:24:51,231 --> 00:24:53,130
what the New York Times says.
Um,

659
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:57,830
nowadays I can't have political 
discussions with people anymore cause it

660
00:24:57,831 --> 00:24:59,990
never gets past ground zero.
Right?

661
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:02,150
We start,
I make a premise,

662
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,620
you challenge the premise.

663
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,660
I bring in a piece of evidence.
You say,

664
00:25:05,661 --> 00:25:07,700
I don't believe that evidence at all.
Here's the other evidence.

665
00:25:07,701 --> 00:25:09,290
And Boom,
Jonah Goldberg,

666
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:10,303
who's a,
like a standard conservative columnist 

667
00:25:12,111 --> 00:25:14,060
wrote a piece a couple months ago where 
he said,

668
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,133
I can't even have fun political 
discussions anymore cause you never get 

669
00:25:17,451 --> 00:25:19,430
past the beginning of the talk,
right.

670
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:23,810
We disagree over over the fact that 
isn't even what we're talking about.

671
00:25:23,811 --> 00:25:24,410
Right.
Here's,

672
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:25,490
here's,
here's reality.

673
00:25:25,491 --> 00:25:26,810
Now let's talk about it.
Wait a minute.

674
00:25:26,811 --> 00:25:28,520
That's your reality.
That's not my area.

675
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:31,850
And so you can't even have the kind of 
fun political discussions we had as kids

676
00:25:31,851 --> 00:25:32,684
or teenagers because there's a basic 
disagreement on what reality looks like 

677
00:25:36,231 --> 00:25:37,220
to different people.
Yeah.

678
00:25:37,221 --> 00:25:39,980
Well there's these tribal agreeing 
tribals the perfect.

679
00:25:39,981 --> 00:25:40,814
Yeah.
We have a tribal agreement to support 

680
00:25:42,051 --> 00:25:44,180
the left.
And you saw that with Hillary Clinton.

681
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,253
There was so many people that were 
defending Hillary Clinton and people 

682
00:25:47,541 --> 00:25:49,610
were calling me right wing people that I
know.

683
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:50,600
We're like,
what are you a right wing?

684
00:25:50,601 --> 00:25:51,590
Or now I'm like,
no,

685
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:55,130
Hillary Clinton is a fucking liar.
Like it's really simple.

686
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,053
Look,
I'm not saying that I liked Donald 

687
00:25:57,170 --> 00:25:57,950
Trump,
I don't,

688
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:01,280
but I'm saying you can't just because 
you don't like Donald Trump.

689
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:05,060
Ignore the fact that the Clinton 
Foundation is Super Fucking Shady,

690
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,073
that Hillary Clinton is clearly a liar.
That they definitely did something with 

691
00:26:09,381 --> 00:26:13,310
the DNC to rig the primaries to keep 
Bernie Sanders out.

692
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:15,020
And now you have Donna,
what is her name?

693
00:26:15,021 --> 00:26:15,854
Donna Brazil.
Donna Brazil coming out about all this 

694
00:26:17,511 --> 00:26:18,344
stuff too.
And she's showing how it was all done 

695
00:26:20,181 --> 00:26:21,014
and how Clinton sort of hijack the 
entire DNC during the campaign made 

696
00:26:24,741 --> 00:26:29,741
everybody dependent upon her campaign.
The whole thing is tribal because people

697
00:26:30,081 --> 00:26:30,641
didn't,
they,

698
00:26:30,641 --> 00:26:35,641
they wanted so badly to get Donald Trump
and make sure he wasn't in office,

699
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:36,943
that they were supporting someone who 
didn't even support gay marriage until 

700
00:26:40,011 --> 00:26:40,844
2013 I mean,
she was a creepy person in so many 

701
00:26:43,891 --> 00:26:44,220
different

702
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,053
ways and still is,
but she represents their team so they 

703
00:26:48,361 --> 00:26:52,470
would had this blind allegiance in this 
tribal loyalty towards the left.

704
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:53,573
I think that's a real problem.
It's a real problem we have in this 

705
00:26:55,441 --> 00:26:59,520
country where people just,
I'm a fucking dolphins fan.

706
00:26:59,521 --> 00:27:03,480
It's dolphins to the death and they get 
that way with the cubs and they get that

707
00:27:03,481 --> 00:27:04,314
way with Democrats and they get that way
with Republicans and you're seeing it 

708
00:27:06,811 --> 00:27:07,644
right now.
You're seeing it right now with people 

709
00:27:08,881 --> 00:27:09,714
that have an inability to in any way say
anything negative about Donald Trump 

710
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:18,330
because he's the president because he's 
a Republican.

711
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:20,760
Well,
you're not living in reality.

712
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:22,650
There's some,
there's certain things,

713
00:27:22,651 --> 00:27:23,484
there's certain,
there's certain things that we really 

714
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:26,700
need to be concerned about.
Forget about politics.

715
00:27:26,701 --> 00:27:28,950
What about the Environmental Protection 
Agency standards?

716
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:29,933
What about what they're doing in Alaska 
where they're trying to drill for 

717
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,060
minerals and,
and,

718
00:27:33,061 --> 00:27:34,380
and uh,
they have this,

719
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:39,950
a very important salmon river that 
they're going to drill right next to and

720
00:27:39,961 --> 00:27:42,690
they're passing this without any advice 
from scientists.

721
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:43,643
They're just going straight to it to try
to make money and people are freaking 

722
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:49,350
the fuck out about this kind of stuff.
And Republicans,

723
00:27:49,351 --> 00:27:51,450
there's so many of them don't want to 
say a peep.

724
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,090
They don't want to say a word about it 
because he's their guy.

725
00:27:54,091 --> 00:27:56,850
He's on their team and people are super 
tribal about it.

726
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:57,963
You know,
this is part of the problem I've been 

727
00:27:59,041 --> 00:27:59,874
having with my political show is I feel,
and everybody thinks it's a trump 

728
00:28:02,311 --> 00:28:04,110
related thing,
but I think it's what you said.

729
00:28:04,111 --> 00:28:07,230
I'm,
I'm having an issue trying to figure out

730
00:28:07,231 --> 00:28:09,150
if my basic,
um,

731
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,013
if my basic understanding of how a 
system like ours is supposed to work is 

732
00:28:13,261 --> 00:28:15,000
fundamentally flawed.
You know,

733
00:28:15,001 --> 00:28:15,834
I always,
I always like to say that wisdom 

734
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:20,160
requires a flexible mind,
but I gotta I gotta live that too,

735
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:22,760
right?
So if I'm seeing stuff that doesn't back

736
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:24,780
up my theory on how things are supposed 
to work,

737
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:26,910
I feel like I have to sit back a little 
bit and go,

738
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,440
okay,
what are we seeing here?

739
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:31,380
And you mentioned a bunch of fundamental
societal changes we're going through.

740
00:28:31,381 --> 00:28:32,214
And we started talking with whether 
we're talking about amateur content or 

741
00:28:33,931 --> 00:28:35,460
everybody being able to broadcast and 
all that.

742
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:38,930
We didn't even mention the fact that our
broadcasts are international now,

743
00:28:38,931 --> 00:28:40,710
so you're not just talking to Americans 
anymore.

744
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:41,843
Um,
and it makes me start to wonder about 

745
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:47,100
the basic idea of are we smart enough 
and this,

746
00:28:47,101 --> 00:28:49,620
this goes against all my principles.
So it's hard for me,

747
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:54,890
but are we smart enough and does our 
modern society require us all to be more

748
00:28:55,441 --> 00:28:59,040
intelligent or in touch or understanding
of the facts?

749
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,120
Then,
for example,

750
00:29:00,121 --> 00:29:03,840
American voters 75 years ago had to be,
um,

751
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,010
I'm starting to see,
and again,

752
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,650
this isn't about trump.
It's about what you were talking about.

753
00:29:07,651 --> 00:29:12,030
The fact that we're having discussions 
over stuff that either isn't real or you

754
00:29:12,031 --> 00:29:12,864
don't understand the issue,
but you have a very strong opinion one 

755
00:29:14,401 --> 00:29:17,460
way or the other about it or some talk 
show host you trust,

756
00:29:17,461 --> 00:29:18,420
told you this is the way it is.

757
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:21,780
So you're going to believe it.
Let's put it this way,

758
00:29:21,781 --> 00:29:22,614
let's,
let's say we've always have had 

759
00:29:23,731 --> 00:29:26,430
uninformed or tribal voters because we 
always have,

760
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,280
is there a tipping point where if you 
have,

761
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:30,403
you know,
if it's changing 10% every decade that 

762
00:29:32,761 --> 00:29:33,241
you say,
okay,

763
00:29:33,241 --> 00:29:35,820
we used to have 20% of people who really
didn't know what was going on.

764
00:29:35,821 --> 00:29:39,420
Now we have 70% of people.
I mean I'm starting to look back and go,

765
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,970
if you can't have basic discussions 
about reality,

766
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:45,610
can you do your job as an,
as a,

767
00:29:45,611 --> 00:29:48,130
as a voter in this society?
Um,

768
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:49,083
and I don't know.
I'm backing up going cause I'm a 

769
00:29:50,531 --> 00:29:52,450
Jeffersonian guy.
So I believe,

770
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:53,231
you know,
in the,

771
00:29:53,231 --> 00:29:55,440
in the old agricultural,
old Republican,

772
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:56,403
you know,
there's a bunch of ideas that go to 

773
00:29:57,041 --> 00:29:57,874
that.
Part of it is a real trust in the 

774
00:29:58,931 --> 00:30:00,220
people.
Okay.

775
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:01,833
I can't decide if,
if the trust I've always had in the 

776
00:30:03,761 --> 00:30:06,370
people was misplaced from the bay,
from the get go,

777
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:07,503
or if the challenges of this modern 
society that we have and an entire 

778
00:30:10,871 --> 00:30:12,730
generation and generations behind them.

779
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:13,563
Let's be honest,
growing up in a world of 140 character 

780
00:30:15,791 --> 00:30:17,380
conversations and all these different 
things,

781
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:20,290
if that doesn't fundamentally change us 
in a way that you might say,

782
00:30:20,291 --> 00:30:22,090
listen,
in the 50s we could handle our,

783
00:30:22,091 --> 00:30:22,924
our voting responsibilities better than 
now because the challenge is to human 

784
00:30:26,231 --> 00:30:28,600
beings now are greater.
I don't know,

785
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:30,880
and I don't have an answer,
which is why I'm sort of backing off and

786
00:30:30,881 --> 00:30:33,600
kind of observing instead of yakking 
about it for a change.

787
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:34,443
Well,
I mean it's simple.

788
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:35,303
I think it's important to talk about it 
just because we were all trying to 

789
00:30:37,121 --> 00:30:38,590
figure it out together.
I think so.

790
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:39,453
And I think that's,
that's really what's going on here is 

791
00:30:40,931 --> 00:30:41,764
that collectively,
we've never really had a voice the way 

792
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:46,780
we have now.
It's never been 320,

793
00:30:46,781 --> 00:30:49,770
whatever it is,
million people that can just chime in.

794
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:50,590
And it's not even that.

795
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:52,540
I mean we have foreigners in Russian 
bots.

796
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:54,250
Uh,
I mean,

797
00:30:54,251 --> 00:30:56,050
this is crazy.
This is never happened.

798
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,010
You know,
in the old days.

799
00:30:57,011 --> 00:30:57,844
Do you remember they used to,
it used to be considered like what your 

800
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:00,724
CIA would do or something just to,
to broadcast Radio Free Europe over the 

801
00:31:04,541 --> 00:31:07,450
Iron Curtain.
Radio Free Europe is a joke.

802
00:31:07,451 --> 00:31:09,650
Now we all talk to each other.
All the timing.

803
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,470
It's,
and then you say to yourself,

804
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:14,440
okay,
if the Russians are doing this to us,

805
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:16,460
aren't we doing this to the Russians 
have hindsight.

806
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:18,520
It's 100%.
In other words,

807
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:19,563
the fake news that's going on.
There may be a bunch of governments and 

808
00:31:22,271 --> 00:31:24,520
corporations and everything,
you know,

809
00:31:24,521 --> 00:31:25,211
they,
they used to say,

810
00:31:25,211 --> 00:31:26,044
the best way to cover up your lie is to 
just flood the system with more lies 

811
00:31:30,761 --> 00:31:33,040
because then everything's up in the air.
Right?

812
00:31:33,041 --> 00:31:33,450
I mean,
yeah,

813
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:34,060
that makes sense.

814
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:34,610
Yeah.
And just,

815
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:37,180
it flooded and,
and I feel like we're flooded now.

816
00:31:37,181 --> 00:31:38,014
And so if you say to yourself,
are we more flooded than we were 75 

817
00:31:39,761 --> 00:31:40,810
years ago?
And if we are,

818
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:45,190
does that require more from the average 
voter than we required 75 years ago?

819
00:31:45,191 --> 00:31:46,024
And let's be honest,
the dirty little secret of the American 

820
00:31:47,951 --> 00:31:48,784
system is everyone who studies it knows 
is that once upon a time this voting 

821
00:31:52,031 --> 00:31:56,710
franchise was actually in relatively few
hands and you had to,

822
00:31:56,810 --> 00:31:58,720
I mean the old idea behind running a 
farm,

823
00:31:58,721 --> 00:32:01,330
I used to read this,
a left wing writer who said it was all a

824
00:32:01,331 --> 00:32:02,590
part of,
they hated poor people,

825
00:32:02,591 --> 00:32:04,080
so they didn't want it to,
I dunno,

826
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:05,860
I think it was more of a voting 
requirement that said,

827
00:32:05,861 --> 00:32:07,120
hey,
if you can run a farm,

828
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:10,190
you can't be too much of an idiot.
So that'll be our requirement.

829
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:12,400
Yet I have this much land.
I don't know,

830
00:32:12,401 --> 00:32:13,234
but,
but you do feel like as democracies 

831
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,390
taken over,
because we're really a republic,

832
00:32:16,391 --> 00:32:19,450
but we've been moving more towards a 
democracy for 200 some years.

833
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,580
If that happens and you turn it go 
clean.

834
00:32:21,581 --> 00:32:25,150
Now we have no qualifications because 
how would you implement them?

835
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:28,330
Somebody would say this is racist or 
classist or whatever,

836
00:32:28,331 --> 00:32:31,690
but without any requirements.
Are we doing a ha,

837
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:35,140
I mean how many people who are voting 
really understand what's going on?

838
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:36,340
Well,
what are those requirements like?

839
00:32:36,341 --> 00:32:37,174
Think about it from telling you that the
20 year old kid in my neighborhood 

840
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,190
bought a $7 million

841
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:41,023
house from Youtube.
This kid is obviously very wealthy and 

842
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:44,203
but does he know what's going on?
Do you have to be smart or do you have 

843
00:32:46,221 --> 00:32:48,620
to be wealthy?
Like do you have to be a land owner?

844
00:32:48,621 --> 00:32:50,630
Do you have to be a farmer?
Do you have to be a business owner?

845
00:32:50,631 --> 00:32:53,980
He's essentially a business and you're 
going to take you to design test sort of

846
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:55,040
grades the test.
Who,

847
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,470
who decides what the questions of an 
informed voter,

848
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,490
you know,
would know would be,

849
00:32:58,491 --> 00:33:00,790
I mean other right in the left going 
agree in a parameter,

850
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,640
be like gerrymandering,
the Gerrymander,

851
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:05,000
the test,
and you know these people,

852
00:33:05,001 --> 00:33:05,834
these 320 million people,
this new found responsibility of being 

853
00:33:09,201 --> 00:33:10,034
able to chime in and communicate.
They're used to just being able to talk 

854
00:33:12,381 --> 00:33:13,214
shit at the gas station they used to be.
They're not used to this being 

855
00:33:15,531 --> 00:33:16,310
permanent.

856
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:20,060
They're not used to this being political
arguments on twitter or crazy dude.

857
00:33:20,061 --> 00:33:22,280
The crazy crazy I want you look at him 
all the time.

858
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,173
The crazy,
they're fascinating though because I 

859
00:33:24,501 --> 00:33:25,334
think this is one step.
I think this is step one to this 

860
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:30,830
augmented reality situation that we're 
talking about.

861
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,233
I think what this represents is a,
a deeper and deeper connection that 

862
00:33:36,531 --> 00:33:37,364
we're going to have with each other.
And I think we're going to get past 

863
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:44,000
language and we're going to get past 
culture and some sort of a weird way,

864
00:33:44,001 --> 00:33:45,770
and it might take a hundred years to do 
this,

865
00:33:45,771 --> 00:33:46,604
but I really believe it's going to be 
some sort of a universal operating 

866
00:33:48,741 --> 00:33:52,680
system that allows us to exchange 
thoughts in a,

867
00:33:52,681 --> 00:33:53,514
in a,
in a way that everyone understands some 

868
00:33:55,161 --> 00:33:57,380
sort of a Rosetta stone for the human 
mind.

869
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,161
Oh,
I love that.

870
00:33:58,161 --> 00:33:58,790
I love that idea.

871
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:00,890
I really think it's possible.
The stone for the human mind.

872
00:34:00,891 --> 00:34:02,780
I think it's possible because I think,
look,

873
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:03,621
the,
the new,

874
00:34:03,621 --> 00:34:05,060
um,
uh,

875
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:05,953
Google Pixel has ear buds and these 
earbuds translate languages in real 

876
00:34:10,311 --> 00:34:12,320
time.
Oh yeah.

877
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:15,050
So if you're in another country and 
fascinating,

878
00:34:15,051 --> 00:34:17,630
fascinating,
and someone's talking in Spanish,

879
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:18,583
you will hear the translation in English
in real time and you'll be able to 

880
00:34:21,231 --> 00:34:24,080
understand what they're saying.
So that's what Esperanto was supposed to

881
00:34:24,081 --> 00:34:25,470
be once upon a time.
Right?

882
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,313
I'm going to be the common language and 
we would all learn it and because we 

883
00:34:28,341 --> 00:34:29,174
would speak it,
there would be no more wars and no more 

884
00:34:30,681 --> 00:34:31,700
awful things.
They thought,

885
00:34:31,701 --> 00:34:32,570
and this is,
this is a,

886
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:35,030
the digital Esperanto.
I forgot about that.

887
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:36,080
Well that's that.
That was,

888
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:37,483
well,
Esperanza has been around for longer 

889
00:34:38,811 --> 00:34:39,644
than this,
but I mean the big push came after the 

890
00:34:40,761 --> 00:34:41,594
first world war was over and the League 
of nations was formed and they were 

891
00:34:43,911 --> 00:34:46,340
trying to figure out how do we never 
have a world war again?

892
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:48,080
We'll have to understand each other 
first of all.

893
00:34:48,081 --> 00:34:50,570
And you know what,
if you could understand all the speeches

894
00:34:50,571 --> 00:34:52,640
and all the demagogues and all these 
other countries,

895
00:34:52,641 --> 00:34:53,474
right?
Yeah,

896
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,070
that's a giant issue.
I mean,

897
00:34:55,071 --> 00:34:57,350
the Tower of Babel is based on that.
Totally.

898
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:00,350
And that that is a real issue.
I can't read Korean.

899
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:00,891
I,
you know,

900
00:35:00,891 --> 00:35:03,320
I don't know what they're saying.
I look at Russian language and I'm like,

901
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:05,290
does these cases are really craving?
Yeah,

902
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,553
it's all,
it's all problem because the lack of 

903
00:35:09,291 --> 00:35:14,000
communication is one of the things that 
makes it easier for us to look at people

904
00:35:14,001 --> 00:35:15,410
as the other.
Yes.

905
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:16,371
Yeah.
And listen,

906
00:35:16,371 --> 00:35:17,204
that's,
that's the common problem because when 

907
00:35:18,711 --> 00:35:19,900
people look at these,
um,

908
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,833
regimes,
let's,

909
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:21,703
we'll,
we'll take the standard one that you'd 

910
00:35:22,301 --> 00:35:23,134
talk about the Nazis,
but there's a bazillion regimes like 

911
00:35:24,471 --> 00:35:25,304
that.
The first thing you do is you have to 

912
00:35:26,241 --> 00:35:27,074
dehumanize the people you want to go 
after because obviously we have human 

913
00:35:29,931 --> 00:35:31,790
feeling towards each other.
But if you can say something,

914
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:32,953
and I think this is what's been most 
depressing for me is that we seem to be 

915
00:35:35,841 --> 00:35:37,800
backsliding on how we see people.

916
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,720
Um,
but I mean this idea that,

917
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:40,861
well,
for example,

918
00:35:40,861 --> 00:35:42,810
one of the things I see all the time,
all the time,

919
00:35:42,811 --> 00:35:45,780
and I don't know where it comes from on 
twitter and everywhere else is this idea

920
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:48,450
that a,
that the different races are inferior to

921
00:35:48,451 --> 00:35:51,360
white folks because white folks built 
all of this and therefore we must,

922
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,220
and you turn around and go,
okay,

923
00:35:53,221 --> 00:35:54,870
one,
how is that helpful too?

924
00:35:54,871 --> 00:35:56,370
Is that even true?
Three.

925
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,970
So what,
so I mean,

926
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,610
the,
so what part is where you just go,

927
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:00,953
okay.
Are you doing anybody any good with 

928
00:36:03,001 --> 00:36:03,541
this?
I mean,

929
00:36:03,541 --> 00:36:04,470
what,
what are we at?

930
00:36:04,471 --> 00:36:05,281
And,
and truthfully,

931
00:36:05,281 --> 00:36:06,990
I don't think most human beings think 
like this.

932
00:36:06,991 --> 00:36:09,150
We're trying to make a living.
We're trying to get by.

933
00:36:09,151 --> 00:36:10,470
We try to get a date.
We're trying to,

934
00:36:10,471 --> 00:36:10,771
you know,
I mean,

935
00:36:10,771 --> 00:36:12,540
there's a bazillion things you have to 
do in this life.

936
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,060
The idea that you have to be responsible
for,

937
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:16,163
uh,
pushing back racism in America seems a 

938
00:36:17,521 --> 00:36:20,310
heck of a lot of responsibility to put 
on an average joe or Jane.

939
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:21,303
Well,
I think that these conversations are 

940
00:36:22,091 --> 00:36:22,924
very,
very important and I think we're having 

941
00:36:23,981 --> 00:36:24,814
them more so than ever before and these 
conversations show how ridiculous it is 

942
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:30,213
to have blind allegiance towards people 
that have the same amount of melanin as 

943
00:36:32,831 --> 00:36:35,080
you do.
It's so fucking stupid.

944
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,720
All human beings essentially either came
from,

945
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:40,630
actually is some speculation that some 
of them might have come from Europe,

946
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:42,220
uh,
thousands of years,

947
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:43,690
uh,
ago as well.

948
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:46,480
But we're talking about hundreds of 
thousands of years ago.

949
00:36:46,481 --> 00:36:49,030
The very first homo sapiens,
they believe came from Africa.

950
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:51,430
Everybody migrated out of there and 
moved wrong.

951
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:53,350
We essentially came from the same 
source.

952
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:54,303
So all of this idea of race is just 
based on a particular amount of time in 

953
00:36:58,751 --> 00:37:03,100
a particular climate that forced people 
to adapt to that climate.

954
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:05,500
And the colder,
darker climates,

955
00:37:05,501 --> 00:37:09,100
you see Paler skin in the Sunnier hotter
climates.

956
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:10,023
You see more Melanin in the idea that 
these people that live with have more 

957
00:37:14,261 --> 00:37:16,900
pale skin are superior than the people 
that have more.

958
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:20,200
Melanin is just patently stupid.
It's just,

959
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:21,123
it's a dumb idea.
If you take into account all the socio 

960
00:37:24,341 --> 00:37:25,174
economic factors that cause people to 
live certain ways as people that are 

961
00:37:29,741 --> 00:37:32,740
isolated,
that live in certain tribal traditions,

962
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:35,530
that these things are all easily 
explained.

963
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,513
And if you want to chalk it off to 
intelligence or the superiority of the 

964
00:37:39,311 --> 00:37:43,000
white race in 2017,
you're a fucking moron.

965
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,330
And this is,
uh,

966
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,020
it's a good thing that we can have these
conversations.

967
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:47,973
So you can expose these all these 
Charlottesville people that you see 

968
00:37:51,221 --> 00:37:54,730
walking around with fucking swastika 
tattoos like Jesus Christ.

969
00:37:54,731 --> 00:37:57,430
You fucking dummies.
Those people that were involved in that,

970
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:01,060
those riots and all that racial bullshit
that just went on.

971
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,313
These people,
they need to see the reaction that the 

972
00:38:05,531 --> 00:38:06,364
rest of the world has and they are 
isolated and insulated in their weird 

973
00:38:08,831 --> 00:38:12,250
little worlds and when they go global 
with that shit and they march with those

974
00:38:12,251 --> 00:38:13,084
Tiki torches down this tree and people 
mock them and talk shit about them 

975
00:38:16,331 --> 00:38:17,164
openly online,
they get to understand how the rest of 

976
00:38:19,091 --> 00:38:23,230
the world sees this ridiculous ideology 
that they subscribed to.

977
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:24,213
This is the power of of free expression 
and communication that we're 

978
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,113
experiencing in 2017 and this is the 
power to nip a lot of this shit in the 

979
00:38:31,841 --> 00:38:32,674
bud.
If we can get past this tribal that 

980
00:38:36,371 --> 00:38:39,220
we're all taking part of this truck 
we're doing,

981
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:42,700
there's tribal nonsense that's male 
versus female.

982
00:38:42,701 --> 00:38:44,950
There's tribal nonsense.
It's white versus black,

983
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:48,340
but there's tribal nonsense that's left 
versus right.

984
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:53,550
There's nationalism does all this tribal
stupidity and all of this stuff is,

985
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:54,783
is being debated and exposed and it's 
happening in real time and to you and I 

986
00:38:58,841 --> 00:39:02,260
can't happen quick enough.
It's still still too goddamn slow.

987
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:05,260
It's still too frustrating to the idea 
that it's still around.

988
00:39:05,261 --> 00:39:07,750
It's still mind boggling.
This kind of racism,

989
00:39:07,751 --> 00:39:08,584
this open,
blatant racism still exists in 2017 but 

990
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:15,250
it's way less prevalent than it was a 
thousand years ago.

991
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:19,030
It's way less accepted than it was 2000 
years ago.

992
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:22,120
And I think that's a blip in time as you
know,

993
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,310
probably better than anybody that I 
know.

994
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,840
Yeah.
But you know,

995
00:39:25,841 --> 00:39:30,430
it's funny because there's a part of me 
that thinks that there must be something

996
00:39:30,431 --> 00:39:31,264
deeply embedded in the DNA or our code 
or whatever that that because it's 

997
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:41,620
either that or people run into this 
stuff and it appeals to them.

998
00:39:41,621 --> 00:39:42,660
So let's say,
you know,

999
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,490
the first time you ever hear a speaker,
and look,

1000
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,940
let me,
let me draw a distinction.

1001
00:39:45,941 --> 00:39:46,774
Because when we took,
I'm one of those people that actually 

1002
00:39:48,251 --> 00:39:49,450
buys into the idea of,
you know,

1003
00:39:49,451 --> 00:39:50,284
I'd love to get to a place where we 
judge people by the content of their 

1004
00:39:52,211 --> 00:39:54,070
character,
not the color of their skin,

1005
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:58,240
but let's not pretend that it's only the
white supremacist types that do that.

1006
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,103
No,
we are so hung up on race that if you 

1007
00:40:00,911 --> 00:40:02,700
could say something like,
uh,

1008
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:06,580
in 15 years we are going to be a society
that doesn't even notice race.

1009
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:07,413
Well in 1968 folks like Martin Luther 
King might have thought that that was a 

1010
00:40:10,451 --> 00:40:12,130
great thing today.
A lot of people would be like,

1011
00:40:12,131 --> 00:40:12,491
no,
wait,

1012
00:40:12,491 --> 00:40:12,790
wait,
wait,

1013
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:13,031
wait,
wait,

1014
00:40:13,031 --> 00:40:15,730
wait.
We should still be noticing race for all

1015
00:40:15,731 --> 00:40:15,971
the,
you know,

1016
00:40:15,971 --> 00:40:17,050
the,
these people need help.

1017
00:40:17,051 --> 00:40:18,430
Or the,
I guess what I'm saying is,

1018
00:40:18,431 --> 00:40:20,620
is that there's a pendulum and,
and I'm,

1019
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:23,680
I'm looking at this,
I feel like we're right in the middle of

1020
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,360
this right now.
So it's so hard to analyze it.

1021
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:27,160
So everybody take this with a grain of 
salt,

1022
00:40:27,161 --> 00:40:27,791
but,
but I,

1023
00:40:27,791 --> 00:40:30,520
I wonder if there's not a pendulum 
involved.

1024
00:40:30,521 --> 00:40:33,520
So for example,
I tend to buy into most of the theories,

1025
00:40:33,521 --> 00:40:34,354
for example,
about racism that have always been put 

1026
00:40:35,861 --> 00:40:36,694
out there.
But I think some are less helpful than 

1027
00:40:38,921 --> 00:40:39,754
others.
And I think they all give you an 

1028
00:40:41,231 --> 00:40:42,064
example.
And I think they come from academia 

1029
00:40:43,451 --> 00:40:45,700
because I think this is sort of what 
academics do.

1030
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,080
And I,
and I think that that's their job,

1031
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:48,860
but a lot of times they'll come up with 
theories.

1032
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:51,970
So one of the ones that,
that drives me crazy is white privilege.

1033
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:52,983
Okay.
White privilege is true in the sense 

1034
00:40:55,451 --> 00:40:56,190
that,
uh,

1035
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:57,023
like,
like one African American guy said to 

1036
00:40:58,121 --> 00:40:58,451
me,
he said,

1037
00:40:58,451 --> 00:41:00,940
I would love to forget about race,
but white people won't let me.

1038
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:01,803
Right.
Which is an,

1039
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:04,480
he says,
every morning I wake up and reminded,

1040
00:41:04,481 --> 00:41:06,640
and you don't have to deal with that.
I get that.

1041
00:41:06,641 --> 00:41:08,370
And I,
and I approve and I understand it,

1042
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:09,693
but here's my problem.
You have to be able to see how telling 

1043
00:41:13,061 --> 00:41:13,894
somebody that you were born with 
something that you didn't earn is going 

1044
00:41:16,931 --> 00:41:19,900
to be received on the other side,
right.

1045
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:20,943
There are some people that have become 
these white supremacists types or or 

1046
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:28,600
anti racial group because they're so 
upset about their perceived position.

1047
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,640
Right?
Like somehow you're blaming me for stuff

1048
00:41:30,641 --> 00:41:32,680
that happened to now.
True or not.

1049
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:33,543
It doesn't.
What I always tell people is it doesn't 

1050
00:41:34,731 --> 00:41:35,564
matter what's true or not.
It matters how that person reacts and 

1051
00:41:38,091 --> 00:41:40,070
if,
if you're explaining to them that,

1052
00:41:40,071 --> 00:41:40,904
listen,
you born with all these unearned 

1053
00:41:41,931 --> 00:41:44,750
privileges and their reaction is,
I'm starving here.

1054
00:41:44,751 --> 00:41:46,830
I don't have a job.
I'm living in a crappy,

1055
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:49,940
how can you tell me that?
Then it might prompt,

1056
00:41:49,941 --> 00:41:52,820
and again I'm analyzing from within the 
Maelstrom that we're in now,

1057
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:53,923
but that that might be a reaction 
counter reaction thing to say that we 

1058
00:41:56,871 --> 00:41:57,704
could have a society where you judge 
people on the content of their 

1059
00:41:59,601 --> 00:42:01,010
character,
not the color of their skin.

1060
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:02,143
That might be as upsetting for an 
African American activist as a white 

1061
00:42:06,051 --> 00:42:06,884
supremacist because this society right 
now pays really close attention to your 

1062
00:42:11,121 --> 00:42:12,740
race for all kinds of reasons.

1063
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:13,873
I mean,
I'm one of those people that believes 

1064
00:42:14,631 --> 00:42:17,690
we're all going to be a nice 10 color 
someday,

1065
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:20,120
you know?
And so it's a moot point.

1066
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:23,030
But there are people out there who 
literally think it's life or death.

1067
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:25,550
If we do become a Tan people at one 
point,

1068
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,390
right?
We have to preserve this race or this.

1069
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,920
I don't get any of that.
None of that makes sense.

1070
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:31,510
That seems foolish.
But it's,

1071
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,353
it's very,
it's consistent with the way human 

1072
00:42:35,931 --> 00:42:38,840
beings evolved.
Trying to listen to the perfect,

1073
00:42:38,841 --> 00:42:41,240
her short lived in these small groups of
people.

1074
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:42,463
We looked like each other and when we 
saw these blond hair dudes pull up in 

1075
00:42:46,341 --> 00:42:48,560
boats with battle ax as you're like,
oh shit,

1076
00:42:48,561 --> 00:42:49,850
they don't even look like us.
Fuck,

1077
00:42:49,851 --> 00:42:50,684
we gotta get Outta here.
That's literally what you had to worry 

1078
00:42:52,851 --> 00:42:53,391
about.
I mean,

1079
00:42:53,391 --> 00:42:55,310
you had to worry about someone who was 
the other.

1080
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:56,300
Well,
and again,

1081
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:57,133
we forget in this time and place that 
the other didn't happen to be a skin 

1082
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,830
color thing.
I mean you could be the shark,

1083
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:03,673
the Carolingian Empire that's being 
attacked by the Vike Vikings and to an 

1084
00:43:06,711 --> 00:43:07,544
outside observer,
you all look like a bunch of blonde 

1085
00:43:09,231 --> 00:43:10,064
haired blue eyed guys.
But to them the vikings are the other 

1086
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:13,813
and in a tribal sense there is inferior 
and awful and barbaric as anything you 

1087
00:43:17,061 --> 00:43:17,894
can think of.
So we make the distinction now based on 

1088
00:43:19,941 --> 00:43:23,150
this or that visual thing.
But throughout history,

1089
00:43:23,151 --> 00:43:23,984
like you said,
I mean you could go to China and they 

1090
00:43:25,461 --> 00:43:28,970
have all sorts of different peoples in 
China that they recognize as the other,

1091
00:43:28,971 --> 00:43:31,340
but if you're looking at them,
they all looked Chinese to you.

1092
00:43:31,370 --> 00:43:32,990
Well,
here's a perfect example where we have a

1093
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:33,824
blind spot of,
this was in Iraq when we took over and 

1094
00:43:38,301 --> 00:43:39,134
killed Saddam Hussein and overthrew him 
and then the Sunni's and the Shias went 

1095
00:43:42,501 --> 00:43:44,830
into a full scale and the Kurds and the 
current,

1096
00:43:44,850 --> 00:43:45,681
everybody's like,
Whoa,

1097
00:43:45,681 --> 00:43:47,510
Whoa,
what the fuck is going on?

1098
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:52,720
I thought you guys were all Muslim.
So many people had no idea there was two

1099
00:43:53,241 --> 00:43:56,750
competing sects of Muslims that lived in
that area.

1100
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:58,530
They have no idea.
There was no struggle.

1101
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:02,030
We may be talking about the population 
as a whole but but come on,

1102
00:44:02,031 --> 00:44:04,130
the people in the government understood 
this really well.

1103
00:44:04,131 --> 00:44:04,964
I mean this is why the first George Bush
didn't want to go in and and to topple 

1104
00:44:08,061 --> 00:44:08,894
Saddam Hussein directly the way the 
second Gulf War did because he didn't 

1105
00:44:11,301 --> 00:44:12,134
want to own that mass and we knew that 
those groups were there because we were 

1106
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:17,870
encouraging them and funding them to 
overthrow.

1107
00:44:17,871 --> 00:44:18,704
I mean we,
there was a big Sunni Shiite rebellion 

1108
00:44:20,571 --> 00:44:23,030
against Saddam at one point after the 
first Gulf War,

1109
00:44:23,031 --> 00:44:26,930
which we were funding and hoping for.
The Kurds have been for a long time.

1110
00:44:26,931 --> 00:44:29,420
Our friends and we've been pushing for 
something.

1111
00:44:29,421 --> 00:44:32,070
They're less than a state,
but more than what

1112
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:34,800
they had under Saddam cause the Turks 
don't love him and not well,

1113
00:44:34,801 --> 00:44:35,634
whenever you overthrow a dictator,
you leave a power vacuum and that power 

1114
00:44:39,661 --> 00:44:43,410
vacuum is never filled in a nice and 
calm and democratic way.

1115
00:44:43,411 --> 00:44:44,880
I mean,
look what's going on in Libya.

1116
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:48,640
Libya is now a failed state and it is a,
uh,

1117
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:51,690
like a breeding ground for Isis.
And it's be,

1118
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:52,533
the reason why is because you had this 
tie radical dictator and we had him 

1119
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:58,950
killed.
We had Kadafi killed,

1120
00:44:59,100 --> 00:44:59,933
which is another great piece of evidence
I used to point to with people with 

1121
00:45:02,971 --> 00:45:04,050
Hillary Clinton.
Like,

1122
00:45:04,051 --> 00:45:07,170
watch the interview where she is about 
to be interviewed.

1123
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:08,550
She's still on camera,
but they,

1124
00:45:08,551 --> 00:45:09,384
they're not,
it's not any of you hasn't officially 

1125
00:45:10,651 --> 00:45:13,800
started and she's talking about the 
death of Kadafi and she's laughing.

1126
00:45:13,801 --> 00:45:15,360
She's like,
we came,

1127
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:16,980
we saw he died.
Yeah,

1128
00:45:16,981 --> 00:45:17,570
that's right.

1129
00:45:17,570 --> 00:45:19,020
That's right.
And she's laughing.

1130
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:20,003
This is not the kind of cavalier mindset
you ever want to see in someone that 

1131
00:45:24,661 --> 00:45:28,800
possesses the power to overthrow a 
government and someone who possesses the

1132
00:45:28,801 --> 00:45:33,390
power to wield nuclear weapons.
This is a person who's a chicken hawk.

1133
00:45:33,391 --> 00:45:34,224
You're completely shielded from the idea
of actually engaging in v actual 

1134
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:40,350
visceral combat yourself.
You're,

1135
00:45:40,351 --> 00:45:43,890
you're outside in,
in flying around in jets,

1136
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:44,873
having catered food.
You're in war rooms making decisions 

1137
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:49,740
while you're an air conditioned 
buildings.

1138
00:45:49,741 --> 00:45:52,740
It's all bullshit.
And these,

1139
00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:57,750
these decisions that you make have 
massive repercussions for decades,

1140
00:45:57,751 --> 00:45:59,240
if not centuries,
centuries.

1141
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:00,623
Here's the thing that you talked about 
that I think is incredibly important in 

1142
00:46:02,521 --> 00:46:06,390
the wrath of the cons.
When gingiss con took over Baghdad,

1143
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:07,553
Baghdad essentially was knocked into the
fucking stone age and might not have 

1144
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:12,780
ever recovered.
That's true.

1145
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:13,793
[inaudible] he just,
the Mongols destroyed the irrigation 

1146
00:46:16,681 --> 00:46:17,514
system that had been around from time in
memorial and wood and how complicated 

1147
00:46:22,111 --> 00:46:22,944
and and advanced their civilization was 
at the time when the Mongols showed up 

1148
00:46:26,341 --> 00:46:28,680
and did all this,
how few people knew this.

1149
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:29,700
I think the,
the,

1150
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:30,563
the question of asking about dictators 
is really important because I think 

1151
00:46:33,991 --> 00:46:34,824
sometimes you have to ask how much of 
the fact that the country is held 

1152
00:46:38,071 --> 00:46:40,440
together is only because there's a 
dictator.

1153
00:46:40,441 --> 00:46:43,230
So we'll use the Yugoslavia example 
cause it's pretty classic.

1154
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:44,730
Um,
for those who don't know,

1155
00:46:44,731 --> 00:46:45,564
Yugoslavia is,
it was a country made up of a bunch of 

1156
00:46:47,311 --> 00:46:51,270
different independent countries now and 
they didn't necessarily get along.

1157
00:46:51,271 --> 00:46:52,104
As a matter of fact,
it's some of the oldest ethnic hatreds 

1158
00:46:54,421 --> 00:46:57,540
in Europe.
When you talk about Serbs and Croats and

1159
00:46:57,541 --> 00:46:58,374
coastal vars and Bosnian Muslims and 
Albanians and all the people in that 

1160
00:47:00,931 --> 00:47:05,600
area there historically at odds,
but under certain governments,

1161
00:47:05,610 --> 00:47:06,650
a Tito,
uh,

1162
00:47:06,670 --> 00:47:07,503
after the second world war formed a 
government where he essentially ruled 

1163
00:47:10,201 --> 00:47:12,720
with an iron fist.
But that's how you kept all these people

1164
00:47:12,721 --> 00:47:13,554
from killing each other.
So when you say Iraq is not even a real 

1165
00:47:16,351 --> 00:47:17,184
country,
because if you didn't have an iron fist 

1166
00:47:19,001 --> 00:47:21,870
to dictator holding it together,
it wouldn't be together.

1167
00:47:22,110 --> 00:47:22,943
Right?
So then when you take the one lynch pin 

1168
00:47:25,230 --> 00:47:28,380
as awful and Saddam Hussein was awful,
awful,

1169
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:29,830
I'll give you a book read that will 
just,

1170
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:32,050
you'll have to,
it's the only book I've ever read that I

1171
00:47:32,051 --> 00:47:32,884
had to read another book afterwards 
before I went to bed at night cause it 

1172
00:47:34,961 --> 00:47:36,230
was so horrible.
Wow.

1173
00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:38,010
He's evil.
It's a,

1174
00:47:38,050 --> 00:47:41,140
it's called the great war for 
civilization by Robert Fisk.

1175
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:42,243
But he,
he's in reporter on the scene and he 

1176
00:47:43,331 --> 00:47:44,164
would tell you what,
what is scrawled on the walls and the 

1177
00:47:46,931 --> 00:47:49,240
prisons that Saddam Hussein's prisons at
the,

1178
00:47:49,390 --> 00:47:51,040
the prisoners would write in their own 
bloody,

1179
00:47:51,041 --> 00:47:52,780
it's horrible stuff.
But the point is,

1180
00:47:52,781 --> 00:47:54,640
is that if there hadn't been a regime 
like that,

1181
00:47:54,910 --> 00:47:57,880
would you have even had in Iraq?
So if you say to yourself,

1182
00:47:57,881 --> 00:47:59,340
okay,
this guy is the only reason this country

1183
00:47:59,341 --> 00:48:02,530
is held together,
what if you pull out that linchpin,

1184
00:48:02,590 --> 00:48:03,311
right?
And he'd say,

1185
00:48:03,311 --> 00:48:04,780
he's horrible.
Yes.

1186
00:48:04,781 --> 00:48:06,670
But if you could look into the crystal 
ball and find out,

1187
00:48:06,671 --> 00:48:08,530
yes,
but we're going to lose a million people

1188
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:10,480
in warfare between all these people.

1189
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,030
If you pull the Saddam Hussein character
out of there too quickly,

1190
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:15,610
it's like a giant Jenga game.
And if you put in the wrong piece,

1191
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:17,230
and that's what happened,
right?

1192
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:20,050
And it's still happening.
It's still happening.

1193
00:48:20,490 --> 00:48:22,030
Listen to Iran is the next,
I mean,

1194
00:48:22,031 --> 00:48:22,864
they're,
they're really gunning for lack of a 

1195
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:25,800
better word for Iran.
Um,

1196
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:29,020
and you can see it if you,
if you know how to read the news and you

1197
00:48:29,021 --> 00:48:32,800
connect this dot with that dot.
It doesn't provide a clear picture,

1198
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:35,350
but he say they demean the United States
military,

1199
00:48:35,470 --> 00:48:37,450
the United States government and our 
friends.

1200
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:41,320
And why are they gunning after Iran?
Iran has been on our,

1201
00:48:41,321 --> 00:48:43,140
on our net.
Naughty boy listens.

1202
00:48:43,210 --> 00:48:46,570
1979 they used to be our best friend in 
the region,

1203
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:47,463
uh,
even even better than Israel early on 

1204
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:53,020
because the Israeli relationship really 
got tight after like 73,

1205
00:48:53,021 --> 00:48:56,830
74 but Iran,
we overthrew a government there with the

1206
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:57,580
British.

1207
00:48:57,580 --> 00:48:58,413
Kermit Roosevelt was one of the people 
involved in that and overthrew a 

1208
00:49:01,031 --> 00:49:04,300
democratically elected regime under Dr 
Mohammed Moza Deck,

1209
00:49:04,450 --> 00:49:06,520
put the shaw back in,
power his son.

1210
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,800
And that became our little,
you know,

1211
00:49:08,830 --> 00:49:10,450
we had,
if you look at geopolitics,

1212
00:49:10,451 --> 00:49:12,490
it's all sort of like playing a risk 
game,

1213
00:49:12,670 --> 00:49:13,503
you know,
and you want to have a little territory 

1214
00:49:14,801 --> 00:49:16,240
on this side of the,
of the,

1215
00:49:16,241 --> 00:49:18,670
of the continent and then another one on
this side and that places.

1216
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:21,730
So if you have Turkey as a friend and 
you have a Israel as a friend,

1217
00:49:21,790 --> 00:49:23,980
then on the other side you have Iran as 
a friend.

1218
00:49:23,981 --> 00:49:26,410
I mean,
we had this whole area sussed for awhile

1219
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:27,453
and the 1979 revolution screwed 
everything up and you could make a 

1220
00:49:31,030 --> 00:49:31,863
decent case that it's since 1979 that 
all this crap that we're dealing with 

1221
00:49:35,741 --> 00:49:36,574
today,
including modern terrorism directed at 

1222
00:49:38,951 --> 00:49:40,840
us stems from all that.

1223
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:42,850
I mean,
that's the domino that begins tumbling,

1224
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:43,833
that explains a lot of things,
including the 82 83 Lebanon involvement 

1225
00:49:46,331 --> 00:49:47,860
and all that stuff.
Yeah.

1226
00:49:47,861 --> 00:49:48,694
It just seems like such a colobus mess 
when you look at all the potential 

1227
00:49:51,881 --> 00:49:54,240
pieces that are in place that could 
cause chaos.

1228
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:56,110
It's money though,
Dude.

1229
00:49:56,111 --> 00:49:58,360
It's money.
I mean there's so much.

1230
00:49:58,750 --> 00:49:59,690
You know,
I went to it,

1231
00:49:59,691 --> 00:50:02,140
I've said this before and it's like a 
violation probably of my,

1232
00:50:02,141 --> 00:50:03,310
uh,
of what I said I would do.

1233
00:50:03,311 --> 00:50:04,990
But I've been,
I went to a Centcom meeting,

1234
00:50:04,991 --> 00:50:06,900
I was invited to this weird symptom,
um,

1235
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:07,833
US Central Command.
I thought I'll tell you the story of 

1236
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:10,624
what time cause it was,
I thought they were going to kill me 

1237
00:50:11,231 --> 00:50:12,760
that there was an assassination attempt 
and you know,

1238
00:50:12,761 --> 00:50:15,220
I'm not a conspiracy nut,
but the whole story was really funny.

1239
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:16,173
But long story short,
I ended up at this Central Command 

1240
00:50:18,671 --> 00:50:20,530
planning meeting with 11 guys.

1241
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:21,513
It's me and 11 other guys and generals 
mean it was chaired by the guy who is 

1242
00:50:24,651 --> 00:50:27,100
the defense secretary now.
Madis um,

1243
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:29,900
so we sat there and they started talking
about half of it was,

1244
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:30,734
well,
what do you think we ought to do about 

1245
00:50:31,281 --> 00:50:32,360
this,
that or the other thing.

1246
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:35,930
And the second half blew my mind because
the whole second half of the meeting was

1247
00:50:35,931 --> 00:50:38,510
about procurement,
not procurement.

1248
00:50:38,511 --> 00:50:40,940
Sounds boring when it basically means is
buying stuff,

1249
00:50:40,941 --> 00:50:41,774
military stuff.
And the meeting was kind of about how 

1250
00:50:44,031 --> 00:50:44,864
important it was that that countries 
don't start shifting over from say our 

1251
00:50:49,791 --> 00:50:50,624
tanks to another country's tanks.
And it wasn't because we wanted to sell 

1252
00:50:53,541 --> 00:50:54,374
them tanks,
it was because we wanted to sell them 

1253
00:50:55,731 --> 00:50:58,670
spare parts for the tanks.
It's the old printer model,

1254
00:50:58,671 --> 00:50:59,361
right?
Oh,

1255
00:50:59,361 --> 00:51:00,770
we'll give you the foreign aid.
Sure.

1256
00:51:00,771 --> 00:51:01,340
We'll give you a lot.

1257
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:03,200
We're going to defend you.
I'll send all this stuff free.

1258
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:04,760
Yeah,
but then who do you have to call for the

1259
00:51:04,761 --> 00:51:06,110
spare parts,
right?

1260
00:51:06,410 --> 00:51:08,750
If you're using US jets,
well,

1261
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:10,970
who's making the parts for those that,
who's selling them?

1262
00:51:11,330 --> 00:51:13,610
So when you sit there and realize how 
much money is involved,

1263
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:16,100
you're doubling down in a place like the
Middle East,

1264
00:51:16,101 --> 00:51:17,750
right?
You're doubling down because one,

1265
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:20,180
you want to get the oil or you want to 
have,

1266
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,880
you want to,
you want to negate what's called,

1267
00:51:22,910 --> 00:51:26,090
um,
used to be called petro extortion.

1268
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:28,760
Petro Black Male.
Because in the 70s,

1269
00:51:28,761 --> 00:51:30,170
and you and I are old enough to remember
this,

1270
00:51:30,171 --> 00:51:31,970
when you had the long gas lines and all 
this,

1271
00:51:32,210 --> 00:51:35,720
when OPEC punished countries like the 
United States for supporting Israel,

1272
00:51:35,990 --> 00:51:38,390
the first thing you realize when 
somebody can do that to you as,

1273
00:51:38,391 --> 00:51:40,310
oh my God,
job number one has to be,

1274
00:51:40,550 --> 00:51:42,080
make sure no one can ever do that again.

1275
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:42,913
You can't,
you can't control our foreign policy by 

1276
00:51:44,271 --> 00:51:46,280
saying you'll cut off the oil.
Because if you do that,

1277
00:51:46,281 --> 00:51:47,610
we'll just come and take the oil,
right?

1278
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:51,530
We'll make sure you can't shut down the 
western world because you don't like our

1279
00:51:51,531 --> 00:51:52,760
policies.
Okay,

1280
00:51:52,761 --> 00:51:54,380
I understand that a bit.
But then you say,

1281
00:51:54,381 --> 00:51:56,090
okay,
not only are we in there for the oil,

1282
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,610
but these countries that are our friends
in the region who help,

1283
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:04,940
who helped keep open access to the oil.
These are places that should be using US

1284
00:52:04,941 --> 00:52:06,830
equipment.
And if they're using US equipment,

1285
00:52:06,831 --> 00:52:08,360
we can sell them us spare parts.
So you're,

1286
00:52:08,450 --> 00:52:10,970
you're not only keeping the oil access,
which is important to us,

1287
00:52:11,150 --> 00:52:14,960
but you're also keeping the one industry
in this country we still made make a ton

1288
00:52:14,961 --> 00:52:15,794
of money in,
which is we still sell great military 

1289
00:52:17,931 --> 00:52:21,770
equipment and great military parts and 
we send our advisers and our maintenance

1290
00:52:21,771 --> 00:52:22,604
crews in every place all over the world 
to to keep that stuff in running 

1291
00:52:24,921 --> 00:52:25,754
operation.

1292
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:28,490
That's doubling down.
So you get the oil and you get the spare

1293
00:52:28,491 --> 00:52:30,770
parts that you give away to them to 
protect the oil.

1294
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:32,900
So you're in this meeting with these 
people.

1295
00:52:32,901 --> 00:52:33,950
How,
how'd you get,

1296
00:52:34,110 --> 00:52:34,943
okay,
well I'll tell the story because it's a 

1297
00:52:35,481 --> 00:52:37,010
fun story,
but it goes so,

1298
00:52:37,011 --> 00:52:38,420
so we get,
you know how it is,

1299
00:52:38,421 --> 00:52:39,254
we get emails,
we get an email one day and we get a 

1300
00:52:40,731 --> 00:52:41,564
letter to our mailbox.
The letter looks like some of what were 

1301
00:52:43,791 --> 00:52:45,440
you doing at the time?
Just the podcast.

1302
00:52:45,441 --> 00:52:47,000
Just you know what we do.
And so they just said,

1303
00:52:47,001 --> 00:52:47,721
hey,
come on down.

1304
00:52:47,721 --> 00:52:48,640
We want to kill you.
No,

1305
00:52:48,650 --> 00:52:49,221
no.
It looked,

1306
00:52:49,221 --> 00:52:51,380
it looked like tell you about some shit 
you should know about.

1307
00:52:51,470 --> 00:52:51,921
Well,
okay.

1308
00:52:51,921 --> 00:52:54,770
It even goes deeper.
I used to have a discussion board online

1309
00:52:55,070 --> 00:52:55,903
and some dude came on the discussion 
board and was saying he was this giant 

1310
00:52:58,071 --> 00:52:59,630
hacker,
this famous hacker.

1311
00:52:59,630 --> 00:53:00,463
You would all know me if I told you and 
you know the discussion boards said 

1312
00:53:02,511 --> 00:53:03,251
you're an idiot.
You know,

1313
00:53:03,251 --> 00:53:04,010
you don't know.
You know,

1314
00:53:04,010 --> 00:53:05,510
and the guy left the discussion board 
saying,

1315
00:53:05,511 --> 00:53:06,344
I'm going to show you what I can do.
You won't believe you just keep your 

1316
00:53:07,941 --> 00:53:09,890
eyes open for a couple of days.
You'll see what I can do.

1317
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:12,140
So three days letter this letter.
Three days later,

1318
00:53:12,141 --> 00:53:15,230
this letter arrives in our mailbox.
The same day I'd get an email saying,

1319
00:53:15,231 --> 00:53:17,570
we'd love to have you come over to 
central command and blah,

1320
00:53:17,571 --> 00:53:18,404
blah,
blah.

1321
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:20,660
It looked like my daughter did it on her
printer.

1322
00:53:20,661 --> 00:53:21,650
There was no like,
you know,

1323
00:53:21,651 --> 00:53:22,484
government seals.
It didn't look official at all and it 

1324
00:53:24,381 --> 00:53:26,250
was in,
I'm going,

1325
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:27,750
okay,
this is this hacker dude.

1326
00:53:27,751 --> 00:53:29,670
This is what he was going to do.
So,

1327
00:53:29,730 --> 00:53:31,200
so it says it's got a phone number to 
call.

1328
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,033
So I called the phone number and it 
doesn't even ring once and a machine 

1329
00:53:34,381 --> 00:53:35,820
picks it up and just leave a message at 
the beep.

1330
00:53:36,270 --> 00:53:37,920
I'm going,
what the hand telling my wife,

1331
00:53:37,921 --> 00:53:40,920
what the hell is this?
So I leave a message at the beep,

1332
00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:41,783
I hardly put the receiver down.
Boom rings and somebody on the other 

1333
00:53:43,921 --> 00:53:46,140
line and it's a guy with a German 
accent.

1334
00:53:46,170 --> 00:53:47,590
I'm going,
what the hell?

1335
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:50,010
It's like some weird bad movie,
right?

1336
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:50,791
And he goes,
no,

1337
00:53:50,791 --> 00:53:50,941
no,
no.

1338
00:53:50,941 --> 00:53:52,350
This is all legit.
Don't worry.

1339
00:53:52,351 --> 00:53:54,680
You just show up at the airport.
There'll be a ticket waiting for you.

1340
00:53:54,681 --> 00:53:57,030
You take it to Washington DC,
there'll be a car waiting for you.

1341
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:57,953
And I looked at my wife and I said,
but this hackers just going to take a 

1342
00:54:00,571 --> 00:54:01,404
photo of me at the airport,
standing there like an idiot and then 

1343
00:54:03,901 --> 00:54:04,920
put it on the website.

1344
00:54:05,370 --> 00:54:06,203
She says,
just go to the airport when there's no 

1345
00:54:07,321 --> 00:54:08,670
ticket.
We'll know it's a scam.

1346
00:54:08,671 --> 00:54:10,700
So I go to the airport does,
it's so crazy.

1347
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:11,960
I wish I was talking.
Okay.

1348
00:54:11,970 --> 00:54:13,630
So there's a ticket,
the ticket.

1349
00:54:13,810 --> 00:54:16,770
So now I've got my bag,
I guess I'm going to dc from Eugene,

1350
00:54:16,771 --> 00:54:18,330
Oregon.
So I get on the plane,

1351
00:54:18,390 --> 00:54:20,550
I get off the plane,
there's no car.

1352
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:21,780
So I called my wife,
I said,

1353
00:54:21,781 --> 00:54:23,010
there's no car.
This is all a scam.

1354
00:54:23,011 --> 00:54:26,190
I don't know what this is a heck of a 
lot of trouble to go through to scam me.

1355
00:54:26,191 --> 00:54:27,360
Right.
Okay.

1356
00:54:27,361 --> 00:54:29,510
So she gets a call from the German dude 
in Florida.

1357
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:30,930
He's at the wrong gate.
Go to this other gate.

1358
00:54:30,931 --> 00:54:31,764
So we go to this other gate.
A town car pulls up with a Middle 

1359
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:35,850
Eastern driver.
Yes.

1360
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:36,713
Get in the car.
So I get in the car and then he starts 

1361
00:54:38,221 --> 00:54:41,910
driving through like side streets in the
backwoods of Virginia or something.

1362
00:54:41,910 --> 00:54:44,160
So I'm on the phone when my wife go on,
if you never hear from him again,

1363
00:54:44,370 --> 00:54:46,350
I see a couple of landmarks here or 
whatever.

1364
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:49,350
He drops me off at this hotel in DC.
I still have,

1365
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:50,213
I don't know what I'm doing.
I don't know why I walk up to the front 

1366
00:54:52,201 --> 00:54:55,350
desk and I go to,
you have a reservation?

1367
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:56,250
Oh yes,
Mr Carlin.

1368
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:58,620
Hold on.
And they come back with this packet,

1369
00:54:58,890 --> 00:54:59,723
this and they headed to be there.
This is your homework for tomorrow 

1370
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:02,333
morning.
And I,

1371
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:03,480
I go,
what?

1372
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:06,270
I go up to the room,
I opened up this and it's all legit.

1373
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:07,860
Long story short,
it's all,

1374
00:55:07,870 --> 00:55:09,660
and there's people at this meeting,
you're not allowed to say,

1375
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:12,420
but there's people that if they sat next
to you would know exactly who they are.

1376
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:15,870
And so I get to the meeting and it's,
it's all like Pentagon milk,

1377
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:20,100
everything's confiscated at the door and
you get this military guy who walks with

1378
00:55:20,101 --> 00:55:20,640
you everywhere.

1379
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:21,473
So if you have to go to the bathroom,
this dude has to walk to the bathroom 

1380
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:23,694
with you.
And so it's a table in this room and 

1381
00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:30,590
madness is at the head of the table.
And then a bunch of soldiers standing in

1382
00:55:31,050 --> 00:55:33,240
a circle around the table just sort of 
standing there.

1383
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:34,163
So you've got like a cordon of soldiers.
And I'm sitting down there with all 

1384
00:55:36,661 --> 00:55:38,430
these other people and I have no idea 
why I'm there.

1385
00:55:38,431 --> 00:55:39,264
But,
so I opened up the packet and it's 

1386
00:55:39,601 --> 00:55:43,200
everybody at the meeting and everybody's
got like three pages on their bio.

1387
00:55:43,230 --> 00:55:46,620
This the honorable Dododododo.
And then I opened it up and then there's

1388
00:55:46,830 --> 00:55:48,840
this little teeny piece of paper that 
says Dan Carlin,

1389
00:55:48,841 --> 00:55:51,570
podcaster.
And they went to like Wikipedia,

1390
00:55:51,571 --> 00:55:53,910
which is all wrong anyway,
and printed it.

1391
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:54,960
And I thought,
Oh yeah,

1392
00:55:54,961 --> 00:55:55,794
these August people at this meeting are 
so excited to be at this meeting with 

1393
00:55:57,961 --> 00:55:59,250
Dan Carlin podcaster.

1394
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:00,083
Right?
So the meeting goes on for awhile and 

1395
00:56:02,161 --> 00:56:03,900
then it breaks up in,
all these people know each other,

1396
00:56:03,901 --> 00:56:06,330
so they go off in their little corners 
to start talking during the lunch break.

1397
00:56:06,331 --> 00:56:07,164
I don't know anyone.
I'm sitting at this table by myself and 

1398
00:56:08,821 --> 00:56:11,910
this officer comes up and goes,
I bet you wonder why you're here.

1399
00:56:12,330 --> 00:56:12,991
I said,
yeah,

1400
00:56:12,991 --> 00:56:14,040
I really would love to know why I'm 
here.

1401
00:56:14,041 --> 00:56:15,690
He goes,
that's my fault.

1402
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:16,583
He goes,
I'm the one.

1403
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:17,880
He goes,
we listened to the show.

1404
00:56:18,030 --> 00:56:19,140
He goes,
we're looking for out.

1405
00:56:19,170 --> 00:56:20,003
This was all about getting outside or 
opinions on what you should do in the 

1406
00:56:22,690 --> 00:56:23,523
Middle East,
and he goes,

1407
00:56:23,710 --> 00:56:25,210
it was my okay,
but here's the,

1408
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:26,073
here's the other thing I was outside or 
opinions on what you should do in the 

1409
00:56:28,810 --> 00:56:29,643
Middle East.
Let's contact that guy does a history 

1410
00:56:30,641 --> 00:56:34,000
pod,
but it's little fly him out to DC,

1411
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:35,800
but here there's your tax dollars at 
work.

1412
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:36,721
Okay,
but it's,

1413
00:56:36,721 --> 00:56:37,300
it's,
it's,

1414
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:38,133
it's,
it's a little bit more sneaky than that 

1415
00:56:39,371 --> 00:56:41,650
because I was there with a guy who knows
how this all runs,

1416
00:56:41,651 --> 00:56:42,484
another guest and we took the taxi cab 
to this place together and he's a real 

1417
00:56:45,611 --> 00:56:46,510
cynical,
he goes,

1418
00:56:46,511 --> 00:56:48,310
let me tell you while you're here,
this is all a cover.

1419
00:56:48,550 --> 00:56:49,510
I go,
what do you mean it's a cover?

1420
00:56:49,511 --> 00:56:50,344
He goes,
it's a cover because these guys are 

1421
00:56:51,671 --> 00:56:55,450
required by law to solicit outside 
opinions for some of this stuff.

1422
00:56:55,451 --> 00:56:57,290
So that's what we're here we're going to
get.

1423
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:59,930
And what they're going to say is they're
going to do exactly what they were going

1424
00:56:59,931 --> 00:57:00,764
to do anyway,
but there'll be able to say we solicit 

1425
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:04,420
to the outside opinion from all these 
different people.

1426
00:57:04,570 --> 00:57:08,890
So I think that's what it was.
La Is it their radars?

1427
00:57:08,891 --> 00:57:09,724
Them,
I don't know.

1428
00:57:10,090 --> 00:57:10,923
But apparently they were supposed to 
think outside the box and so they 

1429
00:57:12,581 --> 00:57:15,100
invited and I was like,
I don't say mandated.

1430
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:16,810
I don't know.
But I was the real outlier.

1431
00:57:16,811 --> 00:57:19,000
All these other people made sense.
I was the guy that was like,

1432
00:57:19,001 --> 00:57:19,834
okay they really getting crazy.
You wearing a suit or are you dressing 

1433
00:57:21,461 --> 00:57:22,294
like that with a beach people wearing a 
suit you wear was the last time I wore 

1434
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:26,820
one.
I,

1435
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:28,543
it's funny cause they take this like 
commemorative photo of you at the end 

1436
00:57:31,210 --> 00:57:32,770
and then they say you can't show those 
photos.

1437
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:33,980
Anybody,
why are you taking it?

1438
00:57:34,690 --> 00:57:35,523
So I could show my wife.
Can you put it on the wall and your 

1439
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:37,744
house?
I don't know what's on the wall in my 

1440
00:57:38,291 --> 00:57:41,920
house now.
So when you're standing there,

1441
00:57:41,921 --> 00:57:43,640
do you have like a badge on it?
So,

1442
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:44,493
hi,
my name is Dan Carlin or it just says 

1443
00:57:45,581 --> 00:57:46,414
Dan Carlin.
And then there's the dude who stands 

1444
00:57:47,741 --> 00:57:50,500
behind you the whole time.
The military and say Dan Carlin.

1445
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:51,970
Hardcore history.
What does it say?

1446
00:57:52,030 --> 00:57:52,721
I Dunno.
I'll show you.

1447
00:57:52,721 --> 00:57:53,890
It's on my phone.
I'll show you later.

1448
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:54,960
Wow.
Um,

1449
00:57:55,210 --> 00:57:56,043
but,
but it was one of those get togethers 

1450
00:57:56,591 --> 00:57:57,424
where you just,
I really wasn't as prepared as I should 

1451
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:02,290
have been because I was pretty darn sure
the whole thing was a hoax,

1452
00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:03,610
you know?
I mean,

1453
00:58:03,611 --> 00:58:05,500
first of all,
if you're going to send me a letter,

1454
00:58:05,501 --> 00:58:06,334
could it look like a letter that the u s
does it have to look like something 

1455
00:58:08,411 --> 00:58:09,244
where you printed the label on your 
brother label maker printer or 

1456
00:58:12,341 --> 00:58:13,420
something?
They always want to leave.

1457
00:58:13,450 --> 00:58:14,283
Maybe they have multiple filters to 
leave in the possibility of plausible 

1458
00:58:16,781 --> 00:58:18,160
deniability.
And the German guy,

1459
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:20,200
by the way,
what turned out to be like a west German

1460
00:58:20,201 --> 00:58:21,034
general that was,
was cooperating with the u s government 

1461
00:58:22,811 --> 00:58:25,870
as part of an exchange program where we,
but I mean the whole thing seemed like,

1462
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:26,913
I just thought it was this hacker dude 
figuring out he's going to really 

1463
00:58:28,541 --> 00:58:30,460
embarrass me in front of the whole 
forum,

1464
00:58:30,461 --> 00:58:30,820
you know?

1465
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:31,653
Oh Wow.
Dan Carlin at the airport thinking he's 

1466
00:58:33,011 --> 00:58:34,540
going to Washington DC.
Yeah,

1467
00:58:34,541 --> 00:58:35,920
exactly.
That's what I thought it was.

1468
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:36,813
Some operation paperclip type shit 
that's snuck him over there and dumped 

1469
00:58:40,781 --> 00:58:43,120
them into Virginia swamp.
Wow,

1470
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:44,253
that's fascinating man.
So did they solicit your opinions and 

1471
00:58:47,621 --> 00:58:50,410
they talk to you about things that day?
All I can say is that both,

1472
00:58:50,411 --> 00:58:51,500
both Madison,
his,

1473
00:58:51,501 --> 00:58:52,151
um,
his aid,

1474
00:58:52,151 --> 00:58:56,380
which was Vice Admiral Harwood,
they are generals these days are so good

1475
00:58:56,381 --> 00:58:57,214
at pr because you,
you get this wonderful thank you note 

1476
00:58:58,901 --> 00:58:59,530
where they go,
oh,

1477
00:58:59,530 --> 00:59:00,720
so great to have you.
Uh,

1478
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:01,893
here's,
here's my,

1479
00:59:01,930 --> 00:59:03,610
please contact us if you,
and you're thinking,

1480
00:59:04,450 --> 00:59:07,150
I mean that's,
it's like a pr thing and I mean,

1481
00:59:07,151 --> 00:59:09,340
I do think there's a little bit of the 
pr involved and I think,

1482
00:59:09,341 --> 00:59:10,174
you know,
has to be having the podcast or there 

1483
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:12,880
might have been good for pr.
Well,

1484
00:59:12,881 --> 00:59:15,280
for sure.
Maybe they thought it shut me up with my

1485
00:59:15,281 --> 00:59:16,120
criticism.
Right.

1486
00:59:16,121 --> 00:59:16,954
Bring you on in the inside.
You're one of our buddies know now you 

1487
00:59:18,641 --> 00:59:19,474
have to be quiet.
Remember when Dennis Miller became with 

1488
00:59:21,381 --> 00:59:22,010
George Bush

1489
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:23,810
and you wouldn't make jokes about George
Bush anymore.

1490
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:25,790
He's my friend.
I give him a pass.

1491
00:59:25,791 --> 00:59:26,900
Like what?
Yeah,

1492
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:28,760
exactly.
What a fucking comic pal.

1493
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:29,990
What are you doing?
Yeah,

1494
00:59:29,991 --> 00:59:30,824
it's um,
that's a fascinating thing that they 

1495
00:59:31,911 --> 00:59:34,010
would bring you over there.
So you got to meet Madis.

1496
00:59:35,410 --> 00:59:37,010
He not only was he cool,
um,

1497
00:59:37,190 --> 00:59:39,050
but he,
he knows his history,

1498
00:59:39,051 --> 00:59:39,471
which,
you know,

1499
00:59:39,471 --> 00:59:41,570
I have a soft spot in heart,
but he was talking about,

1500
00:59:41,810 --> 00:59:42,643
you know,
we're talking about the Middle East and 

1501
00:59:43,161 --> 00:59:45,230
he's talking about the history of this 
and history of that.

1502
00:59:45,231 --> 00:59:46,490
And,
and I'm sitting here going,

1503
00:59:46,491 --> 00:59:47,960
and you know,
I know that history pretty well.

1504
00:59:48,310 --> 00:59:49,820
And I was sitting there going,
gee,

1505
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:51,710
don't they call them the warrior monk?
I mean,

1506
00:59:51,711 --> 00:59:54,150
he said he was,
I found him fascinating I think.

1507
00:59:54,170 --> 00:59:57,710
And I thought he really understood what 
I always hope these people understand,

1508
00:59:57,711 --> 00:59:59,120
which is the limits of power.

1509
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:01,190
So you would say madison was very good 
about saying,

1510
01:00:01,191 --> 01:00:02,024
listen,
we can't keep doing this and we can't 

1511
01:00:03,171 --> 01:00:04,910
keep doing that.
And I thought to myself,

1512
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:06,013
that's right.
I don't know how much the president's 

1513
01:00:06,950 --> 01:00:08,790
listen,
but I mean I remember thinking Madison's

1514
01:00:08,810 --> 01:00:10,620
right about that.
So I think he is listening.

1515
01:00:11,270 --> 01:00:14,690
My friends that are in the military,
almost all of them universally,

1516
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:17,150
we're very pleased that madness was 
taking over.

1517
01:00:17,390 --> 01:00:18,530
He's popular especially.
Yeah,

1518
01:00:18,531 --> 01:00:20,960
he's popular.
Extremely popular because they feel like

1519
01:00:20,961 --> 01:00:21,794
they finally have support now.
They felt like they were handcuffed 

1520
01:00:24,261 --> 01:00:27,530
during the Obama administration and that
there was this,

1521
01:00:27,531 --> 01:00:28,730
uh,
you know,

1522
01:00:28,731 --> 01:00:31,860
you had to go almost through a PR firm 
before any decisions for me,

1523
01:00:31,861 --> 01:00:35,150
they had to like consult the 
ramifications publicly is like that too.

1524
01:00:35,330 --> 01:00:36,163
They said,
Lyndon Johnson was picking the specific 

1525
01:00:37,401 --> 01:00:38,510
bombing targets.
But,

1526
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:40,220
but here's the problem you have.

1527
01:00:40,660 --> 01:00:42,170
Um,
if you realize,

1528
01:00:42,171 --> 01:00:43,430
and if you don't,
you're an idiot,

1529
01:00:43,790 --> 01:00:47,480
that you will actually hurt your 
longterm goals.

1530
01:00:47,481 --> 01:00:48,320
If,
for example,

1531
01:00:48,321 --> 01:00:51,050
you hit a school and killed 200 little 
children,

1532
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:52,190
you realize,
listen,

1533
01:00:52,191 --> 01:00:53,024
the whole policy has really held hostage
by the potential for a disastrous 

1534
01:00:56,481 --> 01:00:59,960
mistake because if the goal is to win 
hearts and minds and listen,

1535
01:00:59,961 --> 01:01:00,794
you're not going to,
that's the only way to win this kind of 

1536
01:01:02,091 --> 01:01:03,140
thing.
Um,

1537
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:06,470
then you do damage to the goal with a 
mistake.

1538
01:01:06,471 --> 01:01:07,304
And mistakes in war are inevitable.
So everybody I think is just trying to 

1539
01:01:10,381 --> 01:01:11,214
be really careful,
but it's hard to fight a war really 

1540
01:01:12,561 --> 01:01:13,394
carefully.
And this war is particularly weird when 

1541
01:01:15,861 --> 01:01:17,930
it comes to that because of the use of 
drones.

1542
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:23,200
The use of drones has changed the entire
idea of what war is.

1543
01:01:24,021 --> 01:01:27,500
Because if you look at what happened 
during the Obama administration,

1544
01:01:27,501 --> 01:01:28,334
this is one of the things that people 
don't like to talk about their 

1545
01:01:29,601 --> 01:01:30,590
supporters of Obama.

1546
01:01:31,790 --> 01:01:32,623
I believe the number is higher than 80% 
of innocent civilians that were killed 

1547
01:01:38,061 --> 01:01:39,350
by drones.
It's,

1548
01:01:39,351 --> 01:01:40,184
I think it's more than 80% imagine any 
sort of technique and war or anything 

1549
01:01:44,001 --> 01:01:45,920
else.
How about policing?

1550
01:01:45,921 --> 01:01:48,800
Let's just go for policing.
Imagine if there was some criminals that

1551
01:01:48,801 --> 01:01:49,634
were holed up in a building and you add 
a hundred people in the building and 20 

1552
01:01:52,881 --> 01:01:55,250
of them were criminals and you killed 
everybody,

1553
01:01:55,460 --> 01:01:56,293
so you killed 80 people that were just 
secretaries and plumbers and just folks 

1554
01:02:00,321 --> 01:02:02,780
doing their job live in their life,
children,

1555
01:02:03,050 --> 01:02:03,883
their families.
You killed all those people to get to 

1556
01:02:05,991 --> 01:02:10,250
those 20 people.
Everyone would freak the fuck out if you

1557
01:02:10,251 --> 01:02:13,570
did it physically yourself,
you ran in with a machine gun and gun,

1558
01:02:13,590 --> 01:02:14,630
everybody down.
You just,

1559
01:02:14,631 --> 01:02:15,464
I had to kill everybody.
That's the only way to get to the bad 

1560
01:02:16,581 --> 01:02:18,320
guys.
Nobody would,

1561
01:02:18,650 --> 01:02:19,950
nobody would forgive you

1562
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:24,060
and it would be front page news and it 
would be a horrific crime,

1563
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:29,720
but it happens constantly when it comes 
to drone warfare in Yemen,

1564
01:02:30,030 --> 01:02:32,820
in parts of the world that we're not 
even supposed to be at war with.

1565
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:33,833
We're sending these flying robots,
they shoot something called Hell fire 

1566
01:02:37,351 --> 01:02:38,184
missiles like Jesus Christ.
They're shooting Hellfire missiles at 

1567
01:02:41,131 --> 01:02:43,600
these,
these targets that they're looking at us

1568
01:02:44,030 --> 01:02:46,490
screen and they're often in like the 
midwest.

1569
01:02:46,491 --> 01:02:47,640
I mean that's where some of these 
things,

1570
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:49,360
you know what it is though.
It's all part of it.

1571
01:02:49,390 --> 01:02:49,910
Listen,
there's a,

1572
01:02:49,910 --> 01:02:50,743
there's a term and you military guys 
listening will all know what it's 

1573
01:02:52,551 --> 01:02:53,780
called,
Rma.

1574
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:59,180
A real revolution in military affairs 
and RMA periods in time happens.

1575
01:03:00,461 --> 01:03:01,294
So you imagine the period between no 
gunpowder and the mass use of gunpowder 

1576
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:07,430
weapons.
That's an RMA period in history,

1577
01:03:07,431 --> 01:03:11,180
right?
But normally what appears to be fast,

1578
01:03:11,181 --> 01:03:12,014
like the transition from no gunpowder,
gunpowder is really relatively slow by 

1579
01:03:16,101 --> 01:03:16,934
modern standards.
So you have several generations to get 

1580
01:03:19,641 --> 01:03:20,474
used to the changes,
but the speed of the pace of change now 

1581
01:03:23,361 --> 01:03:25,640
is so quickly that by the time you begin
to say,

1582
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:26,713
okay,
we've been using the current weapons 

1583
01:03:27,890 --> 01:03:28,723
systems and set up for five years,
now we think we're starting to 

1584
01:03:30,531 --> 01:03:31,280
understand it.

1585
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:32,840
It's obsolete.
Right?

1586
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:33,793
What I said,
and this is so long ago that we've been 

1587
01:03:35,541 --> 01:03:36,374
podcasting a long time Joe,
but I remember years and years ago when 

1588
01:03:38,271 --> 01:03:40,040
we first started using these drones,
I said,

1589
01:03:40,490 --> 01:03:44,360
we're going to screw this up because 
we're using them the same way the United

1590
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:47,510
States used atomic weapons,
which is as though no one else will ever

1591
01:03:47,511 --> 01:03:48,590
get them,
right.

1592
01:03:48,770 --> 01:03:52,790
We are establishing the rules and when 
other people get this stuff,

1593
01:03:52,820 --> 01:03:55,070
those are going to be the rules.
They operate under two.

1594
01:03:55,071 --> 01:03:57,050
But our attitude,
and I've never understood this,

1595
01:03:57,051 --> 01:03:58,910
but we have a very,
maybe it's the um,

1596
01:03:59,060 --> 01:03:59,893
maybe it's how democratic or republics 
work in the sense that we can only 

1597
01:04:03,351 --> 01:04:04,184
really think short term because the 
politicians are only rewarded short 

1598
01:04:06,891 --> 01:04:08,600
term.
But I mean if you say,

1599
01:04:08,601 --> 01:04:10,850
listen,
these are the goals of our drone program

1600
01:04:10,851 --> 01:04:13,790
for the next five years,
you're not incorporating what's going to

1601
01:04:13,791 --> 01:04:15,260
happen when China gets drones.

1602
01:04:15,380 --> 01:04:17,420
And if,
and what I said at the time is,

1603
01:04:17,690 --> 01:04:18,523
do you know how mad we're going to be if
another major country uses drones the 

1604
01:04:21,231 --> 01:04:22,064
way we're using them now?
And it's the same thing with nuclear 

1605
01:04:24,141 --> 01:04:24,974
weapons.
Once other countries got nuclear 

1606
01:04:25,731 --> 01:04:26,720
weapons,
we backed off and went,

1607
01:04:26,750 --> 01:04:29,350
oh well then we have to have some rules 
governing this now.

1608
01:04:29,660 --> 01:04:30,493
Well,
but when we were the only ones with 

1609
01:04:31,431 --> 01:04:32,264
them,
we would threaten to use them all the 

1610
01:04:32,631 --> 01:04:33,330
time.
Yeah.

1611
01:04:33,330 --> 01:04:34,310
You know,
you better not do that.

1612
01:04:34,311 --> 01:04:36,860
We'll Nuku easy to say when you're the 
only ones with it.

1613
01:04:36,861 --> 01:04:38,570
So when you talk about the drone 
warfare,

1614
01:04:38,930 --> 01:04:40,910
um,
I would suggest that the problem of,

1615
01:04:40,911 --> 01:04:42,980
of,
of collateral damage,

1616
01:04:42,981 --> 01:04:44,510
for lack of a better word,
um,

1617
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:46,730
is when we've been dealing with for a 
long time now.

1618
01:04:46,731 --> 01:04:47,564
I mean,
once you talk about the strategic 

1619
01:04:48,471 --> 01:04:50,660
bombing of cities,
um,

1620
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:53,090
first world war,
it started Second World War,

1621
01:04:53,370 --> 01:04:54,440
uh,
was massive.

1622
01:04:54,630 --> 01:04:56,380
Um,
then you,

1623
01:04:56,420 --> 01:04:58,880
then anything is a walk back.
So if you say something like,

1624
01:04:59,060 --> 01:05:00,110
yes,
Joe Rogan,

1625
01:05:00,170 --> 01:05:02,330
sure we killed those 200 kids at that 
school.

1626
01:05:02,331 --> 01:05:04,190
And it's regrettable,
but that's an unusual thing.

1627
01:05:04,191 --> 01:05:07,160
It's not like world war two where we 
carpet bombed whole cities.

1628
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:08,540
Right?
And they're right.

1629
01:05:08,930 --> 01:05:10,820
But is that the standard we can operate 
with?

1630
01:05:10,821 --> 01:05:12,620
Will,
I would suggest that the question is,

1631
01:05:12,890 --> 01:05:15,020
is does it hurt or help what you're 
really after?

1632
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:16,520
If,
if Joe Rogan's,

1633
01:05:16,790 --> 01:05:18,430
God,
sorry for even going here,

1634
01:05:18,610 --> 01:05:19,443
but if Joe Rogan's children were killed 
in a bombing raid that another country 

1635
01:05:22,601 --> 01:05:23,434
launched,
there is nothing that they could do to 

1636
01:05:25,181 --> 01:05:28,600
stop Joe Rogan from hating them for the 
rest of his life.

1637
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:29,793
And if Joe Rogan hating the means,
Joe Rogan's going to find a way to make 

1638
01:05:32,141 --> 01:05:35,980
you feel his pain.
You just created another enemy while you

1639
01:05:35,981 --> 01:05:36,814
were trying to eliminate enemies.
This is what's so scary about 

1640
01:05:39,230 --> 01:05:39,960
terrorists.

1641
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:43,030
You just changed not just the people 
that were directly affected,

1642
01:05:43,031 --> 01:05:45,910
but the people that saw the ripples of 
pain.

1643
01:05:45,940 --> 01:05:46,870
Giant.
Yes,

1644
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:47,733
and again,
all I tell people and people get 

1645
01:05:50,171 --> 01:05:50,771
offended,
Joe,

1646
01:05:50,771 --> 01:05:52,510
I've never understood people get 
offended where I say,

1647
01:05:52,540 --> 01:05:56,650
just put yourself in the other guy's 
moccasins for a minute,

1648
01:05:56,900 --> 01:05:57,980
right?
If you say,

1649
01:05:58,120 --> 01:05:58,953
because what people say to me is I had 
some guy get screaming mad at me saying 

1650
01:06:01,151 --> 01:06:03,070
basically he,
he followed the dominoes and saying,

1651
01:06:03,071 --> 01:06:05,980
are you saying we deserved nine 11 and I
said,

1652
01:06:05,981 --> 01:06:09,100
if that's really where you took that,
if that's where your argument goes,

1653
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:11,020
I said,
then you totally misunderstood me.

1654
01:06:11,260 --> 01:06:12,093
I'm saying no one's saying deserved,
but saying this is probably what caused 

1655
01:06:15,221 --> 01:06:17,200
it.
I listen.

1656
01:06:17,201 --> 01:06:19,030
Why are we a target?
It's not,

1657
01:06:19,031 --> 01:06:20,800
it's not wrong.
As a matter of fact,

1658
01:06:20,801 --> 01:06:24,430
I would suggest it is freedom.
What does that even mean?

1659
01:06:25,090 --> 01:06:27,730
And I would suggest this,
while there are some people who say,

1660
01:06:27,731 --> 01:06:28,564
listen,
look at the way you have women on 

1661
01:06:29,261 --> 01:06:30,520
billboards,
scantily clad.

1662
01:06:30,521 --> 01:06:32,140
Yes,
there are people that hate that and that

1663
01:06:32,141 --> 01:06:33,970
they don't want that either.
At the same time,

1664
01:06:34,210 --> 01:06:36,610
in a lot of these countries,
you were talking about Iran earlier.

1665
01:06:36,611 --> 01:06:39,970
Let's talk about Iran.
Iran has got two separate things going.

1666
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:40,833
They've got the countryside and they've 
got the cities and they've got a ton of 

1667
01:06:43,301 --> 01:06:47,680
the population that's under 30 and in 
the cities they'd love to dance and they

1668
01:06:47,681 --> 01:06:48,131
loved,
you know,

1669
01:06:48,131 --> 01:06:49,900
the Iranians are not like the,
you know,

1670
01:06:50,260 --> 01:06:51,910
you said they all seem like Muslims to 
us,

1671
01:06:51,911 --> 01:06:53,270
but they're all very different from each
other.

1672
01:06:53,271 --> 01:06:54,550
And,
and the Arabians,

1673
01:06:54,551 --> 01:06:55,384
for example,
are known to be kind of Spartan and 

1674
01:06:57,191 --> 01:06:58,150
Stoic,
whereas the,

1675
01:06:58,151 --> 01:07:00,100
the Persians,
as they used to be called,

1676
01:07:00,310 --> 01:07:01,810
are a fun,
loving food,

1677
01:07:01,811 --> 01:07:02,980
loving dance,
loving.

1678
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:05,110
I mean,
they're very capitalistic.

1679
01:07:05,111 --> 01:07:06,400
So in a funny way,
there's an,

1680
01:07:06,430 --> 01:07:08,140
and that's why we were so close to them 
for so long.

1681
01:07:08,141 --> 01:07:12,610
There's a natural affinity between us 
and I always say it would be pretty darn

1682
01:07:12,611 --> 01:07:15,400
easy if we treated them right the same 
way my Stepdad said,

1683
01:07:15,401 --> 01:07:16,234
you know,
you can destroy the Soviet Union by 

1684
01:07:17,621 --> 01:07:21,070
dumping Elvis records,
porn and blue jeans on them,

1685
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:22,203
which kind of is what happened.
There's a way I think to approach this 

1686
01:07:25,061 --> 01:07:25,894
Muslim world thing and let's not pretend
it won't be totally destabilizing 

1687
01:07:28,660 --> 01:07:31,450
because if you drop porn,
blue jeans and Elvis on those countries,

1688
01:07:31,451 --> 01:07:32,284
now you're going to have a counter 
reaction with all these clerics and 

1689
01:07:34,811 --> 01:07:38,020
whatever that are freaking out.
But at the end of the game,

1690
01:07:38,290 --> 01:07:41,410
you won't end up looking like the bad 
guy if you're bombing them.

1691
01:07:41,411 --> 01:07:42,244
It's,
it is so hard to look like the good guy 

1692
01:07:44,711 --> 01:07:46,570
when you're bombing people,
you know?

1693
01:07:46,690 --> 01:07:48,490
And so if you could say to me,
listen Dan,

1694
01:07:48,491 --> 01:07:51,070
these are killers who want to hurt us 
and we've got to take them out.

1695
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:53,050
I totally get that.
But then I would say to you,

1696
01:07:53,051 --> 01:07:56,200
you have to take them out in a way that 
doesn't screw up.

1697
01:07:56,410 --> 01:07:57,610
You know,
the main mission,

1698
01:07:57,611 --> 01:08:00,250
which is let's stop people from wanting 
to kill us.

1699
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:01,233
Right?
Like the way they took out Osama bin 

1700
01:08:03,310 --> 01:08:04,630
Ladin.
Yeah,

1701
01:08:04,660 --> 01:08:05,380
that's about,
you know,

1702
01:08:05,380 --> 01:08:06,300
and listen,
what are some,

1703
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:07,153
what that showed us too is that a lot of
these people that are supposedly our 

1704
01:08:09,191 --> 01:08:12,370
friends in this war on terror aren't,
and we knew this has been the Pakistanis

1705
01:08:12,371 --> 01:08:13,204
especially,
but I mean they're not really that 

1706
01:08:14,471 --> 01:08:16,400
close.
There'd be our friends because they want

1707
01:08:16,401 --> 01:08:17,234
the,
the spare parts for the tanks we gave 

1708
01:08:18,831 --> 01:08:21,470
them and all these kinds of things.
So I mean,

1709
01:08:22,190 --> 01:08:24,270
yeah,
this global warfare things just,

1710
01:08:25,190 --> 01:08:26,023
you got to wonder at what point in time 
is this ever gonna level is ever going 

1711
01:08:29,161 --> 01:08:29,920
to normalize?

1712
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:33,440
Is it ever going to calm down or what 
does it get us?

1713
01:08:33,530 --> 01:08:35,270
What doesn't get us?
That's a song.

1714
01:08:35,910 --> 01:08:37,570
Well look,
I know what it gets some people there,

1715
01:08:37,620 --> 01:08:39,050
and this is the problem our whole 
country has,

1716
01:08:39,051 --> 01:08:39,884
doesn't it?
That that some people are able to get 

1717
01:08:42,051 --> 01:08:42,884
government to respond to them because 
they give government money or what have 

1718
01:08:46,131 --> 01:08:47,810
you,
and then they can get what they want.

1719
01:08:47,811 --> 01:08:50,690
But does that correspond to what we 
need?

1720
01:08:50,810 --> 01:08:53,060
Right.
Do we need these wars?

1721
01:08:53,210 --> 01:08:54,043
I don't know.
I mean when they say we need to protect 

1722
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:55,641
the oil.
Well,

1723
01:08:55,641 --> 01:08:57,920
you know,
the whole oil climate has really changed

1724
01:08:58,130 --> 01:08:58,963
since the 19th just to protect the oil.
The idea is to keep these people at bay 

1725
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:06,650
so that none of them could ever 
consolidate and become some gigantic,

1726
01:09:06,651 --> 01:09:10,490
huge war machine that could threaten us 
globally.

1727
01:09:10,550 --> 01:09:11,580
You know what's at,
again,

1728
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:13,220
this is a military history major 
talking,

1729
01:09:13,221 --> 01:09:14,054
so I think differently about this,
but in a sense that would be so much 

1730
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:17,870
easier for us to beat.

1731
01:09:18,290 --> 01:09:19,123
I mean,
the funny thing is we know how to beat 

1732
01:09:19,941 --> 01:09:22,160
big countries doing audit,
but if we're,

1733
01:09:22,161 --> 01:09:24,350
we're engaging in thermo nuclear 
warfare,

1734
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:28,100
nobody wins.
If we can stop them from ever getting to

1735
01:09:28,101 --> 01:09:29,510
that point,
that's the success.

1736
01:09:29,630 --> 01:09:33,140
The success is keeping them fragmented,
keeping them beaten down,

1737
01:09:33,380 --> 01:09:35,900
and that if we could do that,
we can keep them,

1738
01:09:35,901 --> 01:09:38,060
but they are showing that they can 
destroy.

1739
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:39,171
You know,
it's funny,

1740
01:09:39,171 --> 01:09:40,520
there's two kinds of destroy your 
country.

1741
01:09:40,521 --> 01:09:42,560
There's destroy your country and leave 
it in rubble,

1742
01:09:42,590 --> 01:09:45,560
which they can't do,
but there's destroy your country.

1743
01:09:45,620 --> 01:09:46,453
You know,
the old line is if they hate our 

1744
01:09:47,181 --> 01:09:49,280
freedoms,
well they did a pretty good job limiting

1745
01:09:49,281 --> 01:09:49,940
them,
didn't they?

1746
01:09:49,940 --> 01:09:50,720
I mean,
because,

1747
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:53,360
because we're eliminating them to 
ourselves.

1748
01:09:53,380 --> 01:09:55,310
And I describes like fleas on a dog.
I mean,

1749
01:09:55,340 --> 01:09:59,780
they're like fleas on a dog and yet the 
dog can tear himself to pieces trying to

1750
01:09:59,781 --> 01:10:02,180
get rid of those fleas and still not get
rid of the fleas.

1751
01:10:02,180 --> 01:10:03,210
Right.
Um,

1752
01:10:03,380 --> 01:10:03,820
but it's,
it,

1753
01:10:03,820 --> 01:10:04,551
it,
you really,

1754
01:10:04,551 --> 01:10:05,384
I mean,
terrorism is so effective because it 

1755
01:10:06,501 --> 01:10:09,620
requires people to act against human 
nature,

1756
01:10:09,830 --> 01:10:10,663
which we can do as individuals,
but it's very tough to get us all 

1757
01:10:12,741 --> 01:10:15,140
collectively to not act like human 
beings.

1758
01:10:15,141 --> 01:10:17,540
It requires us to act against our 
nature,

1759
01:10:17,541 --> 01:10:20,300
which is you punched me on punching you.
Right.

1760
01:10:20,690 --> 01:10:21,523
And in a funny way,
it requires us to be punched and to not 

1761
01:10:23,721 --> 01:10:25,010
punch back,
I think.

1762
01:10:25,220 --> 01:10:26,750
But how does that work?
Right.

1763
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:27,673
There's a,
there's a book by Mark Kurlansky who's 

1764
01:10:28,851 --> 01:10:30,080
a,
who's a leftist for sure.

1765
01:10:30,081 --> 01:10:31,880
So just know going into it what you're 
dealing with.

1766
01:10:32,180 --> 01:10:35,520
But it's a book on nonviolence and he's 
trying to,

1767
01:10:35,540 --> 01:10:36,373
to point out something which I've always
tried to point out to nonviolence is a 

1768
01:10:39,561 --> 01:10:44,270
tactic and against certain things,
it's extremely effective,

1769
01:10:44,330 --> 01:10:45,860
right?
It's not effective against everything,

1770
01:10:45,861 --> 01:10:47,810
but sometimes it's,
it's a fun,

1771
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:48,560
I mean,
mark,

1772
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:52,520
if you could do to Martin Luther King 
what we could do to people now his,

1773
01:10:52,521 --> 01:10:53,354
his sitting,
uh,

1774
01:10:53,420 --> 01:10:54,253
for example,
one of the things you young people may 

1775
01:10:55,101 --> 01:10:58,010
not know is one of the,
his effective protest was to go to these

1776
01:10:58,011 --> 01:10:59,390
all white,
um,

1777
01:10:59,780 --> 01:11:00,613
counters in the south where they 
wouldn't serve black folks and just sit 

1778
01:11:02,661 --> 01:11:04,100
at the counter and wait to be arrested.

1779
01:11:04,310 --> 01:11:06,800
And then when he was arrested,
Time magazine would be there to get,

1780
01:11:06,980 --> 01:11:07,813
and there's a great photograph of him 
being handcuffed just for the audacity 

1781
01:11:10,821 --> 01:11:12,320
of sitting at a soda counter.
Right?

1782
01:11:12,321 --> 01:11:13,154
And it was very powerful,
but it was powerful because you saw 

1783
01:11:15,781 --> 01:11:18,990
violence initiated against somebody who 
was totally peaceful,

1784
01:11:18,991 --> 01:11:22,230
right?
If today you could go up to him and just

1785
01:11:22,231 --> 01:11:23,064
tase him or do something that,
that that was not physically violent 

1786
01:11:26,941 --> 01:11:29,040
than he wouldn't get what he needed out 
of that,

1787
01:11:29,041 --> 01:11:29,874
which is he needed that photograph of 
him being physically manhandled for the 

1788
01:11:33,150 --> 01:11:33,983
simple or like not to change subjects,
it's the same subject but like the 

1789
01:11:36,421 --> 01:11:38,280
pictures that were coming out when I was
a kid,

1790
01:11:38,281 --> 01:11:39,114
you can open up those giant life 
magazine books with a great photos of 

1791
01:11:41,521 --> 01:11:45,980
life and one of them was famous,
it was a black protester in the south of

1792
01:11:45,981 --> 01:11:49,350
Alabama or Mississippi and he's standing
there with his arms at his side,

1793
01:11:49,351 --> 01:11:50,220
not resisting at all.

1794
01:11:50,220 --> 01:11:51,053
And the police officer has,
has sicked a German shepard on him who 

1795
01:11:53,461 --> 01:11:55,110
was biting him,
right?

1796
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:56,880
And you look at yourself right there and
you go,

1797
01:11:56,910 --> 01:11:58,350
okay,
that photograph,

1798
01:11:58,351 --> 01:12:01,560
right.
They're motivated so much public opinion

1799
01:12:01,561 --> 01:12:02,394
in a different direction.
But what if they didn't need to use a 

1800
01:12:03,931 --> 01:12:04,764
dog or a water cannon?
What if they could have just injected 

1801
01:12:06,931 --> 01:12:08,920
you from behind?
The guy falls limping.

1802
01:12:08,950 --> 01:12:09,783
You just carry him off silently.
Will you just diminished his power to 

1803
01:12:12,931 --> 01:12:13,681
make a deal?
Oh yeah.

1804
01:12:13,681 --> 01:12:15,000
That's it.
That's it right there.

1805
01:12:15,670 --> 01:12:16,503
And you look how powerful that is,
but it's powerful because some guy is 

1806
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:21,620
being violently attacked.
Two appears to be new.

1807
01:12:21,630 --> 01:12:23,300
Nothing more than asking,
uh,

1808
01:12:23,310 --> 01:12:24,360
you know,
for his rights.

1809
01:12:24,510 --> 01:12:26,670
Now,
if you didn't have that violence,

1810
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:29,480
does that somehow change the message and
make it less powerful?

1811
01:12:29,490 --> 01:12:31,260
They could,
could've just injected him quietly,

1812
01:12:31,261 --> 01:12:32,490
taken him off to jail.

1813
01:12:33,090 --> 01:12:35,730
This doesn't happen,
and this made a big difference.

1814
01:12:36,650 --> 01:12:39,120
That's a very powerful photograph.
Well,

1815
01:12:39,121 --> 01:12:43,350
it's people who aren't there get a 
chance to understand the barbaric nature

1816
01:12:43,351 --> 01:12:44,790
of this.
You get to see your,

1817
01:12:44,791 --> 01:12:45,624
you're literally getting attacked by an 
animal that's on a leash and being 

1818
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:52,170
black.
I was going to say,

1819
01:12:52,171 --> 01:12:52,681
you would say,
well,

1820
01:12:52,681 --> 01:12:54,390
what did that guy do if he just murdered
somebody?

1821
01:12:54,391 --> 01:12:55,230
We're all going,
okay,

1822
01:12:55,260 --> 01:12:56,330
well that's what you get,
pal.

1823
01:12:56,331 --> 01:12:57,164
But if all he's doing is saying,
do I really have to sit at the back of 

1824
01:12:59,941 --> 01:13:03,640
the bus in 1965 or something?
It this,

1825
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:05,580
this kind of thing motivated a lot of 
people.

1826
01:13:05,850 --> 01:13:09,570
But if you know it's like 60 minutes did
a great piece,

1827
01:13:09,571 --> 01:13:10,404
I want to say 1992,
1993 where they were showing all of the 

1828
01:13:12,751 --> 01:13:16,320
new anti protestor weapons that were in 
development.

1829
01:13:16,530 --> 01:13:18,780
And what's funny is several of them have
arrived.

1830
01:13:18,780 --> 01:13:22,410
One of them is the sonic cannon,
which they deployed against uh,

1831
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:24,700
anti new world order protest or types 
the,

1832
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,990
isn't that what they used against people
that were in Cuba?

1833
01:13:28,020 --> 01:13:29,940
Wasn't that something,
I know there's a,

1834
01:13:29,941 --> 01:13:30,774
there's a rumor that there was something
used in people that hasn't been figured 

1835
01:13:33,091 --> 01:13:35,160
out yet,
but this was the sonic canon thing where

1836
01:13:35,161 --> 01:13:37,680
you can target but something.
Got You.

1837
01:13:38,140 --> 01:13:39,510
Some people,
well some people said,

1838
01:13:39,511 --> 01:13:40,051
well,
Madsen,

1839
01:13:40,051 --> 01:13:40,710
Cuba,
right?

1840
01:13:40,710 --> 01:13:41,101
Yeah,
they will.

1841
01:13:41,101 --> 01:13:41,934
They said they lost their hearing or 
something and they assume it was the 

1842
01:13:43,441 --> 01:13:45,910
government that they were fucked up.
Like what the,

1843
01:13:45,911 --> 01:13:48,480
the,
they couldn't physically here it is that

1844
01:13:48,481 --> 01:13:50,850
what it was like something like that.
Just that's not hearing damage,

1845
01:13:51,690 --> 01:13:53,940
but see if he could pull that up and 
figure out what the,

1846
01:13:54,580 --> 01:13:56,940
imagine instead of that power here photo
that made a difference.

1847
01:13:56,941 --> 01:13:59,250
Imagine if you could have just aim the 
sonic cannon and,

1848
01:13:59,251 --> 01:14:01,770
and people leave because it's painful.
Well,

1849
01:14:01,830 --> 01:14:02,663
does that reduce the value then of that 
nonviolent protest that was so powerful 

1850
01:14:06,140 --> 01:14:06,851
and well,
this is what they're,

1851
01:14:06,851 --> 01:14:09,300
they're doing this right here.
This is,

1852
01:14:09,301 --> 01:14:12,310
this is really weird.
Um,

1853
01:14:12,310 --> 01:14:15,340
so a group of American diplomats in 
Havana,

1854
01:14:15,341 --> 01:14:16,174
Cuba have suffered severe and 
unexplained hearing loss over the past 

1855
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:19,833
year,
which u s officials believe was caused 

1856
01:14:20,681 --> 01:14:25,240
by a covert and advanced sonic device.
So this is something that we're not even

1857
01:14:25,241 --> 01:14:27,490
aware of,
but we have those devices.

1858
01:14:27,491 --> 01:14:28,324
That's why they might know.
But do they just not want to comment on 

1859
01:14:30,970 --> 01:14:32,200
that?
We possess these things.

1860
01:14:32,201 --> 01:14:33,034
He's able,
we know we've deployed them rip into 

1861
01:14:34,121 --> 01:14:36,070
this one.
They don't know what this one is.

1862
01:14:36,071 --> 01:14:37,900
Right?
So they should know.

1863
01:14:37,990 --> 01:14:40,120
Anyway,
the device admitted a sound that was not

1864
01:14:40,121 --> 01:14:42,010
audible to human ears.
They added,

1865
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:43,233
it would indicate that it was most 
likely an infrasonic or ultrasonic 

1866
01:14:46,151 --> 01:14:46,984
weapon.
Infrasonic weapons can cause physical 

1867
01:14:48,341 --> 01:14:52,420
pain without detection though,
they usually target the entire body than

1868
01:14:52,421 --> 01:14:53,920
rather just the eardrums.
Wow.

1869
01:14:53,921 --> 01:14:56,260
How fucking bizarre.
That's like,

1870
01:14:56,261 --> 01:14:59,440
it's a different kind of origin bond out
control though,

1871
01:14:59,441 --> 01:14:59,850
you know?

1872
01:14:59,850 --> 01:15:00,910
And,
and if,

1873
01:15:00,911 --> 01:15:01,660
um,
you know,

1874
01:15:01,660 --> 01:15:04,270
for example,
the famous Gandhi Salt March,

1875
01:15:04,271 --> 01:15:06,210
which,
which is considered a,

1876
01:15:06,250 --> 01:15:07,083
one of the big moments in nonviolent 
history where he had all of his 

1877
01:15:09,011 --> 01:15:13,540
supporters walk into the clubs of the 
authorities and he told them,

1878
01:15:13,541 --> 01:15:14,374
don't resist it all.
You just go down and then let the next 

1879
01:15:16,871 --> 01:15:18,250
row get hit too.
And then the neck,

1880
01:15:18,370 --> 01:15:21,120
because that was a powerful sign of,
you know,

1881
01:15:21,130 --> 01:15:23,110
who's right and who's wrong in this 
whole thing.

1882
01:15:23,290 --> 01:15:24,123
But if you could just deploy that Sonic 
Canon and all those people had so much 

1883
01:15:26,681 --> 01:15:27,514
pain in the rear,
they just had to leave and nobody got 

1884
01:15:28,601 --> 01:15:29,530
beaten.
There was no blood,

1885
01:15:29,531 --> 01:15:31,540
there was no dogs,
there were no water cannons.

1886
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:35,500
Does that undercut the power of 
nonviolent protest to make change?

1887
01:15:35,650 --> 01:15:36,483
It's fascinating that that might have 
been in the minds of the people who 

1888
01:15:38,801 --> 01:15:39,970
designed this thing,
right?

1889
01:15:39,970 --> 01:15:41,500
Well,
it's so abstract,

1890
01:15:41,501 --> 01:15:45,400
the idea of this sonic weapon that you 
don't hear,

1891
01:15:45,670 --> 01:15:50,020
but that affects your hearing and it 
causes injury to your body,

1892
01:15:50,110 --> 01:15:53,380
but you don't hear it like the,
that's not going to affect us because it

1893
01:15:53,381 --> 01:15:54,430
doesn't,
it's not a bat,

1894
01:15:54,610 --> 01:15:56,240
right.
A bat that hits a person,

1895
01:15:56,250 --> 01:15:59,380
you understand it when you get a picture
afterwards that you can circulate.

1896
01:15:59,381 --> 01:16:00,430
Look what they did to me.
Well,

1897
01:16:00,431 --> 01:16:03,820
remember the Chicago convention in 68 
that everybody,

1898
01:16:03,940 --> 01:16:04,773
you know,
where the protesters were beaten so 

1899
01:16:05,861 --> 01:16:08,310
badly on television and all that stuff,
um,

1900
01:16:08,740 --> 01:16:11,920
if you didn't have to beat him,
does it lose a lot of its power?

1901
01:16:11,921 --> 01:16:12,754
If you just deployed the sonic cannon 
and everybody goes away because it 

1902
01:16:14,381 --> 01:16:15,214
hurts,
it seems to me like you would've just 

1903
01:16:16,871 --> 01:16:19,370
diffused one of the most important 
movement.

1904
01:16:19,490 --> 01:16:20,323
I would call that one of the big 
political things that happened in the 

1905
01:16:22,601 --> 01:16:24,130
United States in the past 50 years.

1906
01:16:24,460 --> 01:16:27,160
And if you didn't,
if there was no actual violence,

1907
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:31,600
it's not a thing.
Isn't it fascinating that we have to see

1908
01:16:31,601 --> 01:16:33,640
something where we go,
oh,

1909
01:16:33,641 --> 01:16:35,490
I know what that is,
that's bad.

1910
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:38,530
And then everybody gets outraged and 
then then change happens.

1911
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:40,290
Isn't that how the Arab spring stuff,
right.

1912
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:41,770
That's the thing about drones,
right?

1913
01:16:42,010 --> 01:16:43,160
We're not there.
Right,

1914
01:16:43,290 --> 01:16:44,123
right.
The one of the reasons why you can 

1915
01:16:44,651 --> 01:16:48,580
justify this is it's not actually done 
by a human who's on the premises.

1916
01:16:48,610 --> 01:16:49,443
There was talk during the big bombing 
campaigns at the Second World War when 

1917
01:16:51,941 --> 01:16:52,774
they were talking about the morality.
This and Churchill famously saw the 

1918
01:16:56,111 --> 01:16:58,450
movies showing some of these German 
cities just leveled.

1919
01:16:58,451 --> 01:17:00,460
And he said,
are we beasts now?

1920
01:17:00,461 --> 01:17:01,780
This is the guy who ordered it.
Right?

1921
01:17:01,781 --> 01:17:03,730
But when he actually saw what happened,
well,

1922
01:17:04,050 --> 01:17:05,640
the guy I grew up next door,
um,

1923
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:07,270
to was,
it was almost an astronaut,

1924
01:17:07,271 --> 01:17:08,320
but he was a fighter pilot.

1925
01:17:08,620 --> 01:17:10,610
And he,
but they conducted bombing runs in,

1926
01:17:10,660 --> 01:17:13,070
in Korea and Vietnam and stuff.
And he said to me,

1927
01:17:13,071 --> 01:17:16,130
if you actually had to see the people we
killed,

1928
01:17:16,131 --> 01:17:17,240
he goes,
we wouldn't have done this.

1929
01:17:17,540 --> 01:17:19,070
But you didn't have to see them.
There was,

1930
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:21,050
there was a uh,
a distance and them,

1931
01:17:21,140 --> 01:17:25,010
and there's a book called on killing by 
US army psychologist David Grossman's,

1932
01:17:25,011 --> 01:17:28,430
his name,
where he talks about killing in terms of

1933
01:17:28,431 --> 01:17:29,810
distance.
Everything is distance.

1934
01:17:29,811 --> 01:17:32,450
So there's intimacy range.
That's when you're killing somebody with

1935
01:17:32,451 --> 01:17:35,270
a knife close up and then the farther 
away you get,

1936
01:17:35,271 --> 01:17:38,000
the easier it is to do the deed he says.
And the less you,

1937
01:17:38,030 --> 01:17:40,310
the less damage you have later 
psychologic.

1938
01:17:40,311 --> 01:17:41,144
Isn't there an analogy to social media 
here about people that can say maybe 

1939
01:17:45,010 --> 01:17:45,843
we'll cruel shit to people,
it's actually on connection and they 

1940
01:17:48,201 --> 01:17:50,810
can't do it in person,
in person,

1941
01:17:50,850 --> 01:17:51,683
it wouldn't,
it wouldn't even be in your character 

1942
01:17:52,570 --> 01:17:54,550
doing a person that not even in your 
case.

1943
01:17:54,550 --> 01:17:55,383
In other words,
you almost have like a dual character 

1944
01:17:57,231 --> 01:18:00,380
that comes out when you know you don't,
you don't have to see this person.

1945
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:01,333
And truthfully,
all I really want from Joe Rogan has to 

1946
01:18:02,541 --> 01:18:03,374
answer to answer me in the best way.
He can answer me as if I call him 

1947
01:18:05,181 --> 01:18:05,990
something,
you know?

1948
01:18:05,990 --> 01:18:10,790
Well anybody who does anything negative 
where the public is aware of it.

1949
01:18:10,791 --> 01:18:12,070
Like,
say this Louis C.

1950
01:18:12,070 --> 01:18:12,903
Case thing or something like that,
or you can immediately find and target 

1951
01:18:15,530 --> 01:18:16,363
that.
Now I have a reason to go after this 

1952
01:18:18,471 --> 01:18:19,340
person.
There's a,

1953
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:20,421
it's a,
it's a,

1954
01:18:20,421 --> 01:18:21,254
it's an acceptable target.
It's an agreed upon target and then 

1955
01:18:24,680 --> 01:18:25,513
people from all over the world could 
just pour their vitriol and anger and 

1956
01:18:29,211 --> 01:18:33,050
bitterness and whatever it is because 
they have some sort of a righteous anger

1957
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:34,333
that they could,
well there's a reason I can be angry at 

1958
01:18:35,661 --> 01:18:36,494
this person or I saw what a Kathy 
Griffin did when she held up that head 

1959
01:18:40,731 --> 01:18:41,510
of Donald Trump.

1960
01:18:41,510 --> 01:18:43,940
But I have a reason now.
I mean I don't,

1961
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:46,730
I'm not standing up for Kathy Griffin 
cause I think what she did was stupid,

1962
01:18:47,030 --> 01:18:47,863
but she was just devastated by that.
I mean they went after her like death 

1963
01:18:53,751 --> 01:18:56,040
threats and hate and anger.
Joe,

1964
01:18:56,060 --> 01:18:58,250
you've taught me a lot about the whole 
social media thing though,

1965
01:18:58,251 --> 01:19:00,170
because I would come in here,
the audience doesn't know this,

1966
01:19:00,171 --> 01:19:01,700
but I would have questions about that 
stuff.

1967
01:19:01,701 --> 01:19:02,534
And you've,
you've thought more about this than I 

1968
01:19:03,681 --> 01:19:06,630
have and you were able on several of k I
quoted you where I,

1969
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:07,401
you know,
I mean,

1970
01:19:07,401 --> 01:19:09,530
cause I tried to make sense of this 
stuff and like I said,

1971
01:19:09,531 --> 01:19:10,364
you're farther along.
I think the road of thinking about some 

1972
01:19:11,661 --> 01:19:13,730
of this stuff and it gave me some 
shortcuts,

1973
01:19:13,940 --> 01:19:14,773
but I mean I do because I think it's a 
fascinating phenomenon because it's 

1974
01:19:17,841 --> 01:19:18,680
never been available.

1975
01:19:18,680 --> 01:19:20,630
And when did people ever have this kind 
of power?

1976
01:19:20,900 --> 01:19:24,320
Your average guy locked in his basement,
you know,

1977
01:19:24,470 --> 01:19:27,170
never goes out,
but he could still talk to the world.

1978
01:19:27,171 --> 01:19:28,004
I mean that's the problem.
We have the stereotype of this loser in 

1979
01:19:30,231 --> 01:19:31,750
their basement.
Which basement?

1980
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:32,451
Good.
No,

1981
01:19:32,451 --> 01:19:34,700
it could be a guy with a family who's at
work.

1982
01:19:34,730 --> 01:19:35,563
Yeah.
And it was just his wife or his wife or 

1983
01:19:37,371 --> 01:19:40,160
his kids.
Anybody just saying horrible shit.

1984
01:19:40,161 --> 01:19:45,161
I mean there's just,
there's so many options for people to be

1985
01:19:45,620 --> 01:19:49,370
nasty to each other.
And this absence of social cues,

1986
01:19:49,640 --> 01:19:52,880
absence of like being in the physical 
presence of someone,

1987
01:19:52,910 --> 01:19:53,390
it's,
it's,

1988
01:19:53,390 --> 01:19:56,240
this is an alien way of communicating.
It's not normal.

1989
01:19:56,420 --> 01:19:57,253
It's one of the reasons why I always 
hated the letters because people could 

1990
01:19:59,511 --> 01:20:00,344
write some,
like I'd get letters from an ex 

1991
01:20:01,401 --> 01:20:02,061
girlfriend.
I'm like,

1992
01:20:02,061 --> 01:20:03,680
what are you talking about?
This is,

1993
01:20:04,070 --> 01:20:08,100
this is a bullshit depiction of our 
relationship made this

1994
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:11,430
romanticized idea of what this is all 
about.

1995
01:20:11,431 --> 01:20:15,300
Like I don't like letters because 
someone can't be there to go,

1996
01:20:15,301 --> 01:20:16,021
wait,
what?

1997
01:20:16,021 --> 01:20:17,660
That didn't happen.
Yeah it did.

1998
01:20:17,700 --> 01:20:19,290
No,
don't you remember you said this?

1999
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:20,153
Oh yeah.
You know there's a physical proximity 

2000
01:20:21,691 --> 01:20:22,524
question too.
Like you're not going to go up to this 

2001
01:20:23,311 --> 01:20:25,440
guy and say this stuff to his face 
because he might knock you in.

2002
01:20:25,441 --> 01:20:26,274
The head.
Can think about a letter is maybe if 

2003
01:20:28,231 --> 01:20:29,064
someone is an honest person,
they can express themselves in a letter 

2004
01:20:31,770 --> 01:20:32,603
in a way that they would have a 
difficult time doing it in first and 

2005
01:20:34,460 --> 01:20:36,840
then cause they full too and they feel 
embarrassed or they have,

2006
01:20:37,290 --> 01:20:39,900
when you're writing something,
you have the opportunity to really think

2007
01:20:39,901 --> 01:20:43,200
about your words and edit and go over it
and then decide,

2008
01:20:43,201 --> 01:20:48,201
this actually represents my real 
thoughts and as imperfect as it is,

2009
01:20:50,310 --> 01:20:51,143
send it.

2010
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:52,013
But when you can do that any moment of 
any day with your phone in the middle 

2011
01:20:57,661 --> 01:20:58,500
like someone's talking to,
yeah,

2012
01:20:58,501 --> 01:20:59,580
hold on a second,
hold on a second.

2013
01:20:59,581 --> 01:21:02,970
Jump the fuck you fucking asshole.
And just tweet the top of these athletes

2014
01:21:02,971 --> 01:21:03,804
or celebrities getting with with what 
was obviously I'm just about to board 

2015
01:21:06,451 --> 01:21:07,284
the plane so I'll just and boom they get
off the plane and there's a huge 

2016
01:21:08,911 --> 01:21:13,170
firestorm cause cause something was 
taken wrong or not the way you meant it.

2017
01:21:13,171 --> 01:21:14,110
Sure.
Yeah.

2018
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:15,233
Yeah.
I mean it's a weird time and I think 

2019
01:21:17,161 --> 01:21:17,994
this is,
I think we're at an adolescent stage of 

2020
01:21:21,211 --> 01:21:23,040
communication.
That's what I think.

2021
01:21:23,041 --> 01:21:25,380
I think we went through all these 
rudimentary steps,

2022
01:21:25,381 --> 01:21:26,214
right?
We went through grunts and then we had 

2023
01:21:27,541 --> 01:21:28,374
verbal language and then we had written 
language and then we had the printing 

2024
01:21:30,811 --> 01:21:31,644
press and then we had the ability to 
broadcast and then then we had social 

2025
01:21:34,531 --> 01:21:35,250
media.

2026
01:21:35,250 --> 01:21:36,083
The ability for anybody to broadcast.
And I think as we move into augmented 

2027
01:21:39,691 --> 01:21:40,524
reality and what I've been thinking 
about more and more is this Rosetta 

2028
01:21:43,381 --> 01:21:44,214
stone idea.
This idea that we're going to come up 

2029
01:21:46,591 --> 01:21:47,424
with some sort of a way of communicating
ideas that's not limited and restricted 

2030
01:21:51,541 --> 01:21:54,750
to language as a military history 
fanatic.

2031
01:21:54,780 --> 01:21:58,710
Do you know what I instantly think of?
I instantly think of the fact that could

2032
01:21:58,711 --> 01:21:59,544
you start a war if one country's average
joes and Janes on social media or 

2033
01:22:04,831 --> 01:22:05,664
whatever passes or start really 
disagreeing in their thousands and tens 

2034
01:22:09,901 --> 01:22:12,630
of thousands and 50 thousands with 
people in another country.

2035
01:22:12,631 --> 01:22:13,464
And we could,
could the Russian people via social 

2036
01:22:15,241 --> 01:22:16,074
media anger the American people via 
social media to such a degree that 

2037
01:22:19,531 --> 01:22:21,490
countries get pulled into conflict?
I don't even,

2038
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:24,780
it's never been possible.
So you can't know.

2039
01:22:24,950 --> 01:22:25,471
Uh,
but,

2040
01:22:25,471 --> 01:22:26,610
but,
but you turn around and go,

2041
01:22:27,030 --> 01:22:28,810
that would be an interesting,
that you,

2042
01:22:28,890 --> 01:22:32,460
you point out quite correctly that we're
essentially Guinea pigs here right now.

2043
01:22:32,490 --> 01:22:33,323
Yes.
Which is what I tried to explain to my 

2044
01:22:34,171 --> 01:22:38,040
daughters that we are,
we are in an era where we're seeing what

2045
01:22:38,041 --> 01:22:41,700
happens when you hand humanity these 
tools that they've never had before.

2046
01:22:42,020 --> 01:22:43,440
Uh,
and there's two ways of looking at it.

2047
01:22:43,441 --> 01:22:45,420
The optimistic one with this is going to
free up,

2048
01:22:45,421 --> 01:22:48,600
open up all or the pessimistic ones,
which say maybe something like,

2049
01:22:48,601 --> 01:22:49,434
Ken,
our representative democracy handled 

2050
01:22:51,571 --> 01:22:54,990
this and not because we can't handle 
communication,

2051
01:22:54,991 --> 01:22:55,824
but maybe like you would say the kind of
communication that we have where these 

2052
01:22:59,281 --> 01:23:00,114
are little teeny chunk.
We're not having deep philosophical 

2053
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:04,890
coffee house Ben Franklin,
kind of calmer.

2054
01:23:05,050 --> 01:23:06,280
We're having 140

2055
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:10,030
character discussions.
What can you say at 140 characters other

2056
01:23:10,031 --> 01:23:11,290
than you're an idiot.
You're wrong.

2057
01:23:11,291 --> 01:23:14,170
It's fake news,
you know in the story and where it to 80

2058
01:23:14,171 --> 01:23:15,004
now.
I'm sure that will make all the 

2059
01:23:16,271 --> 01:23:17,770
difference in.
I wonder if it does.

2060
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:21,790
I help me get clear my,
I can't clear my throat 140 characters,

2061
01:23:21,990 --> 01:23:24,910
so it'll help me.
I think it's going to cause a shift.

2062
01:23:24,911 --> 01:23:25,744
I really do.
I believe that the shift from one 40 to 

2063
01:23:28,061 --> 01:23:28,894
two 80 will make people,
it'll give people the opportunity to be 

2064
01:23:32,261 --> 01:23:35,980
more clear with their ideas.
I will say that it's disheartening for a

2065
01:23:35,981 --> 01:23:36,814
person like myself who enjoys depth 
because even the history shows her so 

2066
01:23:39,311 --> 01:23:40,144
long as I enjoy the depth to see people 
confronted with like a page of text 

2067
01:23:44,081 --> 01:23:47,110
going on too long to read it funny,
but you do go,

2068
01:23:47,111 --> 01:23:47,944
okay,
can you really be a useful citizen as a 

2069
01:23:49,541 --> 01:23:52,400
voting member of this,
an informed citizenry and do your job if

2070
01:23:52,401 --> 01:23:54,240
if,
if you see a page of text like Whoa,

2071
01:23:54,370 --> 01:23:57,160
I mean the constitution today would have
to be 140 characters,

2072
01:23:57,340 --> 01:23:57,860
you know,
for,

2073
01:23:57,860 --> 01:23:59,290
for,
for most of the people today to go,

2074
01:23:59,291 --> 01:24:00,460
okay,
I'll sit down and read that.

2075
01:24:00,580 --> 01:24:01,413
One of the things that your podcast has 
done that's amazing has given people 

2076
01:24:03,911 --> 01:24:04,744
information in a very entertaining form 
that they would never sit down and read 

2077
01:24:08,141 --> 01:24:09,910
a book about.
There's a ton of people,

2078
01:24:09,911 --> 01:24:14,911
probably me included that will never 
read as much about Genghis Khan as I got

2079
01:24:15,011 --> 01:24:17,470
from your podcast.
But you went to see,

2080
01:24:17,471 --> 01:24:19,930
and this is what I hope for because we 
always say I don't,

2081
01:24:19,990 --> 01:24:22,990
I liked the idea of being an appetizer 
for people on history.

2082
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:24,033
If I introduced somebody to the Hmong 
goals and then they went and go to our 

2083
01:24:27,791 --> 01:24:28,624
website,
we put all of the materials we use and 

2084
01:24:29,801 --> 01:24:31,510
we linked directly to a place where you 
can get them.

2085
01:24:31,780 --> 01:24:32,613
So if you actually went out and bought 
some books on the Mongols after that or 

2086
01:24:35,860 --> 01:24:40,070
or that created an intellectual 
relationship between you and the Mongols

2087
01:24:40,120 --> 01:24:41,350
were for the rest of your life.

2088
01:24:41,380 --> 01:24:43,840
Oh this is a mongols they found Genghis 
Khan's tomb or something.

2089
01:24:43,841 --> 01:24:48,220
You're into it because you know about,
well I mean that's awesome.

2090
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:50,580
In terms of,
I mean I heard 'em,

2091
01:24:50,620 --> 01:24:51,453
I got a great letter,
this is the highlight of my career was 

2092
01:24:53,051 --> 01:24:57,130
this letter from the wife of a historian
that we used in the world war one series

2093
01:24:57,131 --> 01:24:59,290
and she wrote me this letter saying you 
have no,

2094
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:00,333
this is like very self serving,
but you have no idea what you're doing 

2095
01:25:02,650 --> 01:25:03,483
because history is something that not a 
lot of people were getting interested 

2096
01:25:05,531 --> 01:25:07,240
in.
And now we have people showing up in the

2097
01:25:07,241 --> 01:25:08,074
classrooms becoming history majors 
because they got interested in what you 

2098
01:25:10,701 --> 01:25:11,534
were doing.
So if we're poking people with a stick 

2099
01:25:14,021 --> 01:25:15,650
and getting them interested in this 
subject,

2100
01:25:15,651 --> 01:25:17,500
do you know how cool it would be to have
that?

2101
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:18,310
You know,
when you're,

2102
01:25:18,310 --> 01:25:19,900
when you're all dead and gone and 
somebody says,

2103
01:25:19,901 --> 01:25:20,770
what did you do?

2104
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:21,800
He said,
wait,

2105
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:24,280
he got a lot of people really interested
in history.

2106
01:25:24,850 --> 01:25:26,680
I think that's the coolest thing in the 
world.

2107
01:25:26,950 --> 01:25:27,783
They've done that.
But it dovetails with what we were 

2108
01:25:28,931 --> 01:25:30,340
talking about.
This whole new media.

2109
01:25:30,341 --> 01:25:31,510
Will it be good?
Would it be bad?

2110
01:25:31,511 --> 01:25:32,890
And it's probably going to be both,
right?

2111
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:36,430
But the idea that people could get 
interested in history again because some

2112
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,040
idiot in his garage was talking about 
it.

2113
01:25:39,041 --> 01:25:41,170
Uh,
I think could be everybody,

2114
01:25:41,171 --> 01:25:42,004
but it's going to be a lot of people and
for those people it is going to have a 

2115
01:25:44,201 --> 01:25:48,550
profound effect and me included.
And I think that ha this new media,

2116
01:25:48,551 --> 01:25:52,030
this thing where nobody is telling you,
Hey dan,

2117
01:25:52,090 --> 01:25:55,960
it's time to do a podcast on blank.
It's time to,

2118
01:25:55,990 --> 01:25:56,823
you know,
cut back this edit that you're doing it 

2119
01:25:58,421 --> 01:25:59,254
based on your interests.
Your knowledge wouldn't have been this 

2120
01:26:00,871 --> 01:26:01,930
show if we'd had yet.

2121
01:26:01,930 --> 01:26:03,710
There was anybody else.
There wouldn't have been this show.

2122
01:26:03,940 --> 01:26:05,540
I would never been able to pull this 
off.

2123
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:06,633
Not in a hundred years.
It's what we have is this unique 

2124
01:26:09,560 --> 01:26:12,940
opportunity to express ourselves in,
um,

2125
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:14,150
uh,
like with a,

2126
01:26:14,750 --> 01:26:17,750
with a personal viewpoint.
Like this is,

2127
01:26:17,790 --> 01:26:18,291
uh,
your,

2128
01:26:18,291 --> 01:26:20,160
your personal interest,
the things that you're,

2129
01:26:20,270 --> 01:26:21,110
you,
there's a pure,

2130
01:26:21,111 --> 01:26:21,944
yeah,
it's the difference between blended 

2131
01:26:22,731 --> 01:26:27,380
whiskey and like a single malt where,
where if like when I get these TV offers

2132
01:26:27,381 --> 01:26:28,214
and you've had zillions of them,
where you go and you talk to these 

2133
01:26:30,051 --> 01:26:32,660
people and you realize instantly if I go
do this with them,

2134
01:26:32,870 --> 01:26:35,060
they're going to homogenize it,
dumb it down,

2135
01:26:35,061 --> 01:26:36,650
but they're going to check and you sit 
there and go,

2136
01:26:36,740 --> 01:26:37,573
they're going to make something far 
inferior to what I'm able to do myself 

2137
01:26:40,671 --> 01:26:43,330
because they really don't understand why
it works in,

2138
01:26:43,380 --> 01:26:44,091
in other words,
like you said,

2139
01:26:44,091 --> 01:26:45,620
you couldn't have been able to do this 
show.

2140
01:26:45,890 --> 01:26:49,010
It's funny to me that the industry,
for example,

2141
01:26:49,011 --> 01:26:51,920
doesn't realize what it is that people 
like about what you do.

2142
01:26:51,921 --> 01:26:53,290
And figure out a way to,
you know,

2143
01:26:53,350 --> 01:26:54,770
they,
they're not open minded enough to say,

2144
01:26:54,771 --> 01:26:56,330
listen,
Joe come under this TV show,

2145
01:26:56,331 --> 01:26:58,300
which is a lot like what you do.
I don't,

2146
01:26:58,380 --> 01:26:59,213
I don't get it.
I don't understand how people like you 

2147
01:27:01,880 --> 01:27:03,830
and people like me and all the people to
do what we do,

2148
01:27:03,831 --> 01:27:07,730
haven't created more of an understanding
in the old media.

2149
01:27:07,820 --> 01:27:09,110
I think they're getting it.
Do you think?

2150
01:27:09,111 --> 01:27:10,850
Well,
eventually there was no way to avoid it.

2151
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:13,250
They're getting it now.
I see.

2152
01:27:13,550 --> 01:27:16,220
Like when I get offers for things,
I understand things like,

2153
01:27:16,250 --> 01:27:16,910
oh,
they're trying,

2154
01:27:16,910 --> 01:27:18,650
they're seeing what I'm doing.
And they're going,

2155
01:27:18,651 --> 01:27:19,790
hey,
we want a piece of this.

2156
01:27:20,060 --> 01:27:20,721
How do we,
and then,

2157
01:27:20,721 --> 01:27:22,730
but if you do a pan,
they pull it off.

2158
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:24,170
I mean,
it would be the same thing.

2159
01:27:24,171 --> 01:27:25,760
This is the problem.
If they did this,

2160
01:27:26,070 --> 01:27:27,080
it's like say if say,
hey,

2161
01:27:27,081 --> 01:27:28,590
we want to put your podcast on blah,
blah,

2162
01:27:28,591 --> 01:27:29,930
Blah and network.
Okay,

2163
01:27:29,931 --> 01:27:33,440
well now I have a bunch of people that 
I'm talking to that I have to run things

2164
01:27:33,441 --> 01:27:34,274
by.
Now I have Zach have a bunch of people 

2165
01:27:35,871 --> 01:27:36,704
that say,
I just think that if you're dress nicer 

2166
01:27:38,570 --> 01:27:39,201
and then,
oh,

2167
01:27:39,201 --> 01:27:40,100
Jesus,
okay,

2168
01:27:40,130 --> 01:27:41,480
well now,
now it's not me.

2169
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:42,650
I'll tell you a story.
So,

2170
01:27:42,651 --> 01:27:43,191
so the,
so,

2171
01:27:43,191 --> 01:27:44,540
so finally,
the TV people,

2172
01:27:44,550 --> 01:27:46,060
um,
they're always promising things.

2173
01:27:46,061 --> 01:27:46,894
Well,
you can do it any way you want you so 

2174
01:27:47,901 --> 01:27:48,770
far.
So finally,

2175
01:27:48,771 --> 01:27:50,420
one of these companies did it so many 
times.

2176
01:27:50,421 --> 01:27:50,961
I said,
okay,

2177
01:27:50,961 --> 01:27:53,120
I'll go forward with you and we'll start
with this project.

2178
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:54,193
Great.
So I'm in a particular us city in the 

2179
01:27:56,811 --> 01:27:59,390
south and we're,
we're cutting the sizzle reel.

2180
01:27:59,390 --> 01:28:01,490
And I said,
now this is going to be hardcore,

2181
01:28:01,491 --> 01:28:02,360
right?
You got me.

2182
01:28:02,361 --> 01:28:03,650
You want hardcore history?
Yes,

2183
01:28:03,710 --> 01:28:05,540
we all the history channel.
Everybody wants it.

2184
01:28:05,541 --> 01:28:06,470
Okay.
So I said,

2185
01:28:06,471 --> 01:28:08,170
so here's what we're going to do.
So the,

2186
01:28:08,220 --> 01:28:09,053
the,
the sizzle reel was on the bombings in 

2187
01:28:11,511 --> 01:28:13,190
the late sixties,
early seventies,

2188
01:28:13,191 --> 01:28:16,130
of like the new left.
So the weather underground and all those

2189
01:28:16,131 --> 01:28:16,964
people,
right?

2190
01:28:17,090 --> 01:28:18,230
So I'm going to do this.
And I said,

2191
01:28:18,380 --> 01:28:19,213
I said,
so the hardcore history way to do this 

2192
01:28:20,721 --> 01:28:21,554
though is to imagine that era with 
today's anti-terror laws and the way we 

2193
01:28:26,061 --> 01:28:26,894
treat terrorists today.
So we were filming like recreation's of 

2194
01:28:29,931 --> 01:28:30,764
like Abbie Hoffman and his American tee 
shirt being waterboarded by CIA agents 

2195
01:28:35,541 --> 01:28:36,374
because if we applied to the modern 
anti-terror to the way that the 

2196
01:28:38,841 --> 01:28:42,260
Americans and they out,
they said,

2197
01:28:42,261 --> 01:28:43,094
listen,
there's a lot of red southern states 

2198
01:28:44,871 --> 01:28:48,080
that would not go for that and all these
guys and you wanted hardcore.

2199
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:49,220
That's,
that's no,

2200
01:28:49,250 --> 01:28:50,083
they didn't really want hardcore.
They wanted to get me through the doors 

2201
01:28:52,251 --> 01:28:54,470
and then we're going to make some group 
think thing,

2202
01:28:54,471 --> 01:28:56,990
you know,
or the group or no effort in group think

2203
01:28:56,991 --> 01:28:57,824
creativity.
Well group think would be fine if you 

2204
01:28:59,191 --> 01:29:03,330
respected all the think in the group,
think if they were all as good as you.

2205
01:29:03,990 --> 01:29:07,050
They don't have the sensibility that not
most of these people,

2206
01:29:07,051 --> 01:29:09,600
most of them were kids.
From my standpoint as an old man,

2207
01:29:09,601 --> 01:29:12,060
now they're all counters.
They're bean counters that are trying to

2208
01:29:12,061 --> 01:29:12,894
protect their own jobs.
What they're worried about is the 

2209
01:29:14,191 --> 01:29:16,050
numbers.
We got the dailies in,

2210
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:17,033
we've got the,
we got the numbers in your trending 

2211
01:29:18,241 --> 01:29:19,074
really well in 18 to 34 Dan Carlin,
and it's not about building an audience 

2212
01:29:22,230 --> 01:29:23,760
over the long haul.
Like you said,

2213
01:29:23,761 --> 01:29:24,594
it's literally about the next rating.
You've got to jump in out of the gate 

2214
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:30,540
big time and you have to have billboards
and a big push.

2215
01:29:30,660 --> 01:29:32,640
I'll give you notice anytime a show 
launches,

2216
01:29:32,850 --> 01:29:33,683
you'll see bill bill board,
like there's this new show called white 

2217
01:29:35,911 --> 01:29:38,640
famous and it's on showtime.
And everywhere you go,

2218
01:29:38,641 --> 01:29:40,890
this is giant billboards for white 
famous.

2219
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:43,320
They're not letting this thing build 
slowly.

2220
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:46,020
They want to push it out of the gate 
with gunpowder,

2221
01:29:46,110 --> 01:29:46,943
boom.
And they're hoping that with that 

2222
01:29:49,231 --> 01:29:52,260
momentum,
the quality of this show will add to the

2223
01:29:52,261 --> 01:29:53,094
momentum and then you're going to build 
up and a bunch of people catch on and 

2224
01:29:56,341 --> 01:29:58,680
eventually we'll get rolling.
But in order to do that,

2225
01:29:58,681 --> 01:30:01,320
they want to take away all the jagged 
edges,

2226
01:30:01,321 --> 01:30:03,990
smooth everything down to make it 
aerodynamic,

2227
01:30:04,140 --> 01:30:04,973
make everything like super homogenize.
I mean that's what they do with every 

2228
01:30:07,351 --> 01:30:08,050
single city.
Oh.

2229
01:30:08,050 --> 01:30:08,883
And what they'll do to your career.
Like the last physical fight I almost 

2230
01:30:11,251 --> 01:30:14,730
had with another adult male was a radio 
program director.

2231
01:30:15,330 --> 01:30:17,580
And the radio program director came into
my town knew,

2232
01:30:17,581 --> 01:30:18,930
and you know,
if you've ever been in radio,

2233
01:30:18,931 --> 01:30:20,700
when they come into town,
knew the first thing they're going to do

2234
01:30:20,701 --> 01:30:21,534
is change everything cause they got to 
put their own stamp on it or why are 

2235
01:30:23,131 --> 01:30:25,080
they there?
So this guy comes in and he goes,

2236
01:30:25,081 --> 01:30:27,180
we're going to rebrand you.
He goes,

2237
01:30:27,181 --> 01:30:30,450
I want everyone to think of your name 
and instantly think of the brand.

2238
01:30:30,451 --> 01:30:31,780
And I'm already,
you know Brian?

2239
01:30:31,860 --> 01:30:32,281
Yeah.
Okay.

2240
01:30:32,281 --> 01:30:33,114
So here's what he said.
So I hate to say this because this will 

2241
01:30:34,651 --> 01:30:37,230
become a meme online that I will have to
live with the rest of my life.

2242
01:30:37,231 --> 01:30:39,690
But it's an absolutely true story.
So the guy says to me,

2243
01:30:39,691 --> 01:30:40,480
he goes,
listen,

2244
01:30:40,480 --> 01:30:41,313
uh,
imagine a billboard that says Dan 

2245
01:30:43,290 --> 01:30:44,310
Carlin,
he fucks chickens.

2246
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:45,930
And I said,
excuse me?

2247
01:30:45,931 --> 01:30:46,381
He goes,
yeah,

2248
01:30:46,381 --> 01:30:47,940
I mean,
so that anytime anybody thought,

2249
01:30:47,941 --> 01:30:48,511
if you,
they would think,

2250
01:30:48,511 --> 01:30:49,344
okay,
he used the chicken fucker and I'm 

2251
01:30:50,011 --> 01:30:50,880
going,
wait a minute.

2252
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:52,440
Really?
He really said yes,

2253
01:30:52,441 --> 01:30:53,340
and I said,
I said to him,

2254
01:30:53,341 --> 01:30:54,600
I said,
I said two things,

2255
01:30:54,601 --> 01:30:55,530
dude.
I said,

2256
01:30:55,531 --> 01:30:57,630
the first thing is I got to live in this
town,

2257
01:30:57,780 --> 01:30:58,613
right,
so really you want that to be the first 

2258
01:30:59,701 --> 01:31:00,690
thing people think.
Okay.

2259
01:31:00,720 --> 01:31:01,553
The second thing is I got to have a 
career after this stupid idea of yours 

2260
01:31:04,531 --> 01:31:08,970
fails to understand where we're building
up a mental image.

2261
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:10,350
You'll be a household name.
I said,

2262
01:31:10,351 --> 01:31:11,520
yes,
I'll be the household name.

2263
01:31:11,521 --> 01:31:13,100
The guy who fucks chickens.
I said,

2264
01:31:14,020 --> 01:31:15,020
and,
and finding,

2265
01:31:15,050 --> 01:31:15,391
you know,
he was.

2266
01:31:15,391 --> 01:31:16,470
After that,
I find these guys.

2267
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:17,460
I said,
dude,

2268
01:31:17,460 --> 01:31:18,293
do you want to step outside right now?
I don't mean my wife laughed at me 

2269
01:31:21,091 --> 01:31:22,650
because I'm already an old man.
When I'm saying,

2270
01:31:22,651 --> 01:31:23,760
she goes,
that would have been great.

2271
01:31:23,761 --> 01:31:24,091
I said,
no,

2272
01:31:24,091 --> 01:31:25,590
this,
this guy was as old as I was,

2273
01:31:25,591 --> 01:31:29,760
but I was so incensed and so angry that 
this guy would,

2274
01:31:29,761 --> 01:31:34,761
would be so cavalier with your future 
human being and every family,

2275
01:31:35,401 --> 01:31:36,620
I mean,
my kicker,

2276
01:31:36,870 --> 01:31:38,700
how are they going to spell fucker on 
billboards?

2277
01:31:38,701 --> 01:31:39,534
You know what?
That's a really good credit they might 

2278
01:31:40,261 --> 01:31:42,240
have had is a euphemism.
But I mean,

2279
01:31:42,241 --> 01:31:43,170
you think about that.
You think,

2280
01:31:43,171 --> 01:31:44,340
okay,
as you said,

2281
01:31:44,341 --> 01:31:47,100
this guy's career depends on him making 
a difference.

2282
01:31:47,130 --> 01:31:50,190
I'm just a tool in his career,
right?

2283
01:31:50,310 --> 01:31:54,150
So you start to realize that when you 
did the podcast and it's your podcast,

2284
01:31:54,750 --> 01:31:57,330
the person that you're worried about 
here is you.

2285
01:31:57,570 --> 01:31:59,680
And not just that,
the ideas that are coming from your,

2286
01:31:59,681 --> 01:32:00,130
not just

2287
01:32:00,130 --> 01:32:01,720
yours alone,
but you own them.

2288
01:32:01,900 --> 01:32:02,530
Right?
So,

2289
01:32:02,530 --> 01:32:05,260
so when I say something that's stupid,
I own that.

2290
01:32:05,261 --> 01:32:06,940
It's not like some stations said,
oh,

2291
01:32:06,941 --> 01:32:07,840
it doesn't push.
You know,

2292
01:32:07,870 --> 01:32:08,703
I got to know fight over the Oj Simpson 
thing when the Oj Simpson trials going 

2293
01:32:11,171 --> 01:32:12,940
on and everybody,
it's all you hear anywhere.

2294
01:32:12,970 --> 01:32:13,803
So I didn't talk about it.
And so they got on me about not talking 

2295
01:32:16,451 --> 01:32:19,930
about it and I had a big fight and I 
walked into the studio and I said,

2296
01:32:19,960 --> 01:32:20,860
fine,
I'll talk about it.

2297
01:32:20,861 --> 01:32:21,700
I said,
you know,

2298
01:32:21,730 --> 01:32:23,500
the whole topic was,
isn't it just too much?

2299
01:32:23,501 --> 01:32:26,390
Damn Oj Simpson everywhere you go.
Oh they were.

2300
01:32:26,440 --> 01:32:27,520
They were.
They were at the,

2301
01:32:27,521 --> 01:32:28,810
you know,
there was a window.

2302
01:32:28,811 --> 01:32:30,550
We were like zoo creatures and they had 
this window.

2303
01:32:30,551 --> 01:32:31,384
They could bring all the sales clients 
to watch us perform and I'm doing there 

2304
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:34,833
and there's like five executives in the 
window just waiting till the next 

2305
01:32:36,971 --> 01:32:38,310
commercial break because we're going to 
be,

2306
01:32:38,311 --> 01:32:40,660
we're going to,
but I mean that's why radio was so awful

2307
01:32:40,661 --> 01:32:41,980
for me and I didn't get fired.

2308
01:32:41,980 --> 01:32:44,440
I must have done a good enough job to 
stay employed,

2309
01:32:44,830 --> 01:32:47,740
but it was go home and pull your hair.
[inaudible] intention.

2310
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:50,740
Constant 10 imagine this is a good 
example for people.

2311
01:32:50,741 --> 01:32:52,510
Imagine if you're a painting,
a picture.

2312
01:32:52,540 --> 01:32:53,373
You had an idea to paint the Mona Lisa 
and you got a bunch of people standing 

2313
01:32:55,751 --> 01:32:56,680
over your shoulder like,
hey,

2314
01:32:56,681 --> 01:32:58,510
make her no small.
Exactly right.

2315
01:32:58,570 --> 01:32:59,081
You know,
you get to,

2316
01:32:59,081 --> 01:33:01,690
her eyebrows are too bushy.
She looks to Italian and I'm like,

2317
01:33:02,930 --> 01:33:06,940
there's a bunch of fucking people.
If you're dealing with these things that

2318
01:33:06,941 --> 01:33:09,490
are just essentially trying to justify 
their jobs,

2319
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:11,270
I mean you're always having that 
whenever you're,

2320
01:33:11,350 --> 01:33:14,410
you're dealing with any sort of an 
executive position and one of the things

2321
01:33:14,411 --> 01:33:17,770
that you realize is how many people are 
unnecessary.

2322
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:18,753
I did Bill Simmons Show,
you know Bill Simmons had a successful 

2323
01:33:21,521 --> 01:33:22,354
podcast and that podcast that led to an 
hbo show and I had a great time on the 

2324
01:33:25,991 --> 01:33:26,350
show.

2325
01:33:26,350 --> 01:33:27,190
No,
no,

2326
01:33:27,191 --> 01:33:28,420
I like him.
He's very nice guy,

2327
01:33:28,660 --> 01:33:31,000
very smart guy.
But when I did his show,

2328
01:33:31,001 --> 01:33:33,760
I'm like,
there's a hundred people working here.

2329
01:33:33,960 --> 01:33:37,060
It's fucking people everywhere.
I get that you need cameraman.

2330
01:33:37,090 --> 01:33:37,923
I get the need sound men,
but then who are all these other 

2331
01:33:39,611 --> 01:33:40,444
fuckers?
You got all these executive type people 

2332
01:33:42,851 --> 01:33:45,300
and office people and all these people 
running around.

2333
01:33:45,310 --> 01:33:46,420
I'm like,
you've,

2334
01:33:46,421 --> 01:33:47,254
you've made this way too complicated.
Like the reason why his podcast is so 

2335
01:33:50,981 --> 01:33:54,340
successful is because it's him.
It's his singular vision.

2336
01:33:54,341 --> 01:33:55,380
His idea,
you're,

2337
01:33:55,381 --> 01:33:56,214
you're getting it from this person and 
when you know that you're getting 

2338
01:33:58,661 --> 01:34:01,660
something from a person and you like how
that guy thinks,

2339
01:34:01,810 --> 01:34:02,643
then it becomes interesting.
But when you're not really getting it 

2340
01:34:05,231 --> 01:34:07,420
from that person,
you've got a bunch of people holding cue

2341
01:34:07,421 --> 01:34:12,421
cards and standing behind them and 
you're creating this bullshit thing.

2342
01:34:12,640 --> 01:34:13,840
Well,
my wife said today we're,

2343
01:34:13,841 --> 01:34:14,674
we're in the hotel room and she turns on
the TV and Ryan seacrest is on and he'd 

2344
01:34:17,821 --> 01:34:18,790
liked,
does 10,000

2345
01:34:18,791 --> 01:34:19,640
things a day,
you know,

2346
01:34:19,690 --> 01:34:20,920
multiple shows.
And she says,

2347
01:34:21,130 --> 01:34:21,963
I don't know how he does that.
That's amazing that he can do all these 

2348
01:34:23,021 --> 01:34:23,840
kinds of things.
I said,

2349
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:26,750
how much of it's really Ryan seacrest's.
I mean how you,

2350
01:34:26,770 --> 01:34:27,603
you basically have to have everything 
ready to go when you walk into a room 

2351
01:34:29,891 --> 01:34:30,724
and who did that?
You know what I like listening to Ryan 

2352
01:34:32,100 --> 01:34:32,933
seacrest.
I like listening to him on the radio 

2353
01:34:34,810 --> 01:34:35,643
because it's almost like listening to an
alien that tries to be like a woman 

2354
01:34:41,141 --> 01:34:46,141
who's a secretary because he does these 
contests like cola call in right now and

2355
01:34:47,681 --> 01:34:48,191
like,
you know,

2356
01:34:48,191 --> 01:34:49,024
have someone to call him.
I like the nagging or whack and then I 

2357
01:34:51,821 --> 01:34:54,160
can go to the bathroom and look at my 
phone.

2358
01:34:54,190 --> 01:34:55,360
Hey,
everybody likes that.

2359
01:34:55,530 --> 01:34:56,950
All right,
let's neck and you're,

2360
01:34:57,140 --> 01:34:58,100
hey,
you want two tickets

2361
01:34:58,100 --> 01:34:59,510
to this art?
Congratulations.

2362
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:00,433
All right,
Monica,

2363
01:35:00,470 --> 01:35:01,580
nice talking to you.
I was like,

2364
01:35:01,581 --> 01:35:03,680
he's not even a fucking human on those 
things.

2365
01:35:03,681 --> 01:35:08,681
It's like he's figured out a way to hit 
this wall,

2366
01:35:09,410 --> 01:35:14,410
this droning sound that resonates with 
the people that live in that existence.

2367
01:35:14,731 --> 01:35:15,564
So the people that are stuck in traffic 
and that checking their phone every 15 

2368
01:35:17,991 --> 01:35:18,824
minutes,
those are the people that are on 

2369
01:35:19,550 --> 01:35:21,650
instagram 35 times a day.
You know?

2370
01:35:21,651 --> 01:35:22,484
That's the average amount of time a 
person looks at instagram 35 times a 

2371
01:35:26,301 --> 01:35:28,280
day.
Wool wool,

2372
01:35:28,340 --> 01:35:30,290
Ryan seacrest fucks chickens,
dude.

2373
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:31,850
Well,
if he fuck chickens,

2374
01:35:31,851 --> 01:35:34,830
he would be like outrageous.
Like that would be like that.

2375
01:35:34,970 --> 01:35:36,860
The guy who said,
you're going to be the chicken fucker.

2376
01:35:37,130 --> 01:35:38,630
He probably listened to Howard Stern.
He's like,

2377
01:35:38,631 --> 01:35:39,464
this guy is outrageous.
We need to get Dan Carlin to be 

2378
01:35:41,001 --> 01:35:42,280
outrageous.
You're a chicken farmer.

2379
01:35:42,360 --> 01:35:43,320
Well,
I it,

2380
01:35:43,321 --> 01:35:45,420
that is the other thing with the 
homogenization talked to,

2381
01:35:45,430 --> 01:35:48,630
it's always about imitating somebody 
who's found a good formula.

2382
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:50,633
I will say this about limbo.
Limbo is right when he says that there 

2383
01:35:52,261 --> 01:35:55,320
will be a wing in the talk radio museum 
devoted to him one day,

2384
01:35:55,580 --> 01:35:57,000
but,
but what he always says,

2385
01:35:57,210 --> 01:35:58,043
which I find interesting is he tried to 
do what he does now multiple times and 

2386
01:36:01,141 --> 01:36:04,560
got fired because their attitude was,
what is the way and we're not taking any

2387
01:36:04,561 --> 01:36:05,760
chances with this.
And then he says,

2388
01:36:05,761 --> 01:36:06,594
the minute I'm successful,
every consultant out there is telling 

2389
01:36:09,121 --> 01:36:11,190
everybody to be as just like him.
In other words,

2390
01:36:11,550 --> 01:36:13,530
if you really,
and if you're a podcast are out there,

2391
01:36:13,531 --> 01:36:15,420
are thinking about doing something in 
the new media,

2392
01:36:15,660 --> 01:36:19,890
understand that there is something so 
valuable about what you specifically are

2393
01:36:19,891 --> 01:36:21,030
bringing to the table.

2394
01:36:21,240 --> 01:36:23,340
And the minute you ask these other 
people what to do,

2395
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:25,830
they're going to,
they don't know what specific about it.

2396
01:36:25,831 --> 01:36:26,850
They're going to go and say,
well,

2397
01:36:26,851 --> 01:36:29,910
we can pull a little piece of what this 
person does and eventually it's not even

2398
01:36:29,911 --> 01:36:31,800
you.
One of the great things I always thought

2399
01:36:31,801 --> 01:36:35,520
about hardcore history is that over time
you self select your audience.

2400
01:36:35,910 --> 01:36:38,310
I think you do that with every podcast.
So you say something like,

2401
01:36:38,311 --> 01:36:39,144
okay,
I'm only going to talk about the stuff 

2402
01:36:39,541 --> 01:36:40,374
I'm interested in.
Well what you know then a year later is 

2403
01:36:42,271 --> 01:36:45,780
whatever fans are listening to you.
It's a pretty good gauge because they're

2404
01:36:45,781 --> 01:36:48,360
there because they like what you're,
so I don't have to sit there and go,

2405
01:36:48,510 --> 01:36:50,070
gosh,
this would be a popular topic.

2406
01:36:50,071 --> 01:36:50,904
I just do what I want to do.
And over time you developed an audience 

2407
01:36:53,761 --> 01:36:54,810
that likes that.

2408
01:36:55,030 --> 01:36:59,050
I also think that there's something 
happening when you do have this sing,

2409
01:36:59,170 --> 01:37:02,380
when you have a singular vision,
like one person who's,

2410
01:37:02,410 --> 01:37:04,570
who's driving this thing,
right?

2411
01:37:05,230 --> 01:37:10,230
And over time I feel like people get a 
sense of you in a way deeper sense.

2412
01:37:11,651 --> 01:37:14,950
And just listening to your words,
they're chunking data,

2413
01:37:15,280 --> 01:37:17,950
they're adding up all of the 
communication that you've had.

2414
01:37:17,951 --> 01:37:18,784
They're seeing how you add,
they're analyzing how you see different 

2415
01:37:23,081 --> 01:37:26,080
scenarios.
They're analyzing how you,

2416
01:37:26,140 --> 01:37:30,190
how you navigate certain and they're 
seeing you when you're tired and they're

2417
01:37:30,191 --> 01:37:33,550
seeing you the way you're feeling in a 
great mood and then maybe they're seeing

2418
01:37:33,551 --> 01:37:35,440
you when something bad happened.
You don't feel so good.

2419
01:37:35,460 --> 01:37:35,951
Yeah.
You know,

2420
01:37:35,951 --> 01:37:36,784
there's,
there's,

2421
01:37:36,790 --> 01:37:37,623
and all this is like,
so they get to know you and there's 

2422
01:37:39,941 --> 01:37:41,350
very,
there they,

2423
01:37:41,470 --> 01:37:44,110
there,
there's an intimate understanding of you

2424
01:37:44,111 --> 01:37:44,944
that is almost impossible to get when 
you're hosting the tonight show or 

2425
01:37:47,801 --> 01:37:49,480
you're acting in a television show

2426
01:37:49,580 --> 01:37:53,270
or doing a five minute piece of content 
opposed to a three hour piece of cotton.

2427
01:37:53,380 --> 01:37:54,940
Yeah.
There's a weird thing.

2428
01:37:55,140 --> 01:37:56,130
I think that's one

2429
01:37:56,130 --> 01:37:58,380
of the things,
like if people know me,

2430
01:37:58,650 --> 01:38:00,090
if you listen to his podcast long 
enough,

2431
01:38:00,091 --> 01:38:00,924
you know me and you might not agree with
me and you might think I'm wrong or I'm 

2432
01:38:04,261 --> 01:38:06,030
a blowhard,
but you know,

2433
01:38:06,031 --> 01:38:07,260
I'm honest.
Right.

2434
01:38:07,400 --> 01:38:08,161
Um,
this,

2435
01:38:08,161 --> 01:38:11,280
I might be wrong,
but I'll tell you if I think I'm wrong,

2436
01:38:11,310 --> 01:38:13,560
if I think I'm wrong,
I'm the first person go,

2437
01:38:13,890 --> 01:38:15,220
I think I'm wrong.
I'm,

2438
01:38:15,221 --> 01:38:16,840
I'm not.
I'm never going to cover that up.

2439
01:38:16,920 --> 01:38:18,840
And you shouldn't believe people that 
don't think they're wrong.

2440
01:38:18,870 --> 01:38:21,300
You can't,
it's not good for you either.

2441
01:38:21,301 --> 01:38:22,134
The person who pulls it off,
it's not good for you because you know 

2442
01:38:23,551 --> 01:38:24,384
you're wrong and you're know you're 
carrying that shit around your head all 

2443
01:38:26,071 --> 01:38:27,090
the time.
Though I always say,

2444
01:38:27,091 --> 01:38:29,330
if you think if people,
and this is again why,

2445
01:38:29,331 --> 01:38:30,164
why one of my current events,
podcasts is not really happening right 

2446
01:38:32,251 --> 01:38:33,084
now because I,
I feel like when you're in absolutely 

2447
01:38:35,491 --> 01:38:38,040
uncharted water,
you can't know what's going on.

2448
01:38:38,040 --> 01:38:41,940
So that's how you feel right now.
I think we're in uncharted and I think,

2449
01:38:41,941 --> 01:38:43,100
I think it's a combination.
Everyone,

2450
01:38:43,200 --> 01:38:44,520
everyone always thinks it's a trump 
thing,

2451
01:38:44,521 --> 01:38:45,810
but to me,
trump is a vector.

2452
01:38:46,060 --> 01:38:46,893
A,
to me,

2453
01:38:47,070 --> 01:38:50,370
what you were talking about with the 
social media is as much a part of,

2454
01:38:50,420 --> 01:38:51,253
of what makes this an absolutely 
unprecedented time and a bunch of other 

2455
01:38:54,751 --> 01:38:57,150
things.
The globalization of the earth.

2456
01:38:57,151 --> 01:38:58,030
Like you're saying,
I'm,

2457
01:38:58,140 --> 01:39:00,570
we're doing shows and hearing from 
people from other countries,

2458
01:39:00,571 --> 01:39:01,404
I mean all this stuff interacting 
together has created an absolutely 

2459
01:39:04,620 --> 01:39:05,453
unprecedented situation.
So maybe I just organize my thinking 

2460
01:39:08,371 --> 01:39:09,204
differently,
but I organize it historically and 

2461
01:39:10,201 --> 01:39:14,130
there's no way to put this into any box 
that's ever existed before.

2462
01:39:14,460 --> 01:39:15,293
So when I watched these talk shows or,
or whatever with people who have no 

2463
01:39:17,911 --> 01:39:19,050
choice,
it's 6:00

2464
01:39:19,050 --> 01:39:19,883
PM I have to be on the air and I have to
have something to say to rile the 

2465
01:39:21,571 --> 01:39:22,110
audience.

2466
01:39:22,110 --> 01:39:23,340
Um,
you know,

2467
01:39:23,370 --> 01:39:24,960
they have no options.
They have to,

2468
01:39:25,110 --> 01:39:26,910
their Gig is,
I know what's going on in,

2469
01:39:26,911 --> 01:39:27,744
let me tell you.
Whereas if they were honest with 

2470
01:39:29,251 --> 01:39:30,990
themselves,
they either would have to say,

2471
01:39:31,020 --> 01:39:32,790
I don't know what's going on and I'm 
watching too.

2472
01:39:33,030 --> 01:39:35,430
Or if they really do believe they know 
what's going on,

2473
01:39:35,730 --> 01:39:37,650
well then you really shouldn't be 
listened to them at all.

2474
01:39:37,950 --> 01:39:40,620
Right.
Then there is no way they could,

2475
01:39:40,650 --> 01:39:42,170
there's no way they could know.
Yeah.

2476
01:39:42,240 --> 01:39:43,073
I think we're dealing with the 
ramifications of a bunch of different 

2477
01:39:45,061 --> 01:39:46,550
pieces that are in play.
Yes.

2478
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:47,393
And I think one of those pieces that 
it's in play and one of the reasons why 

2479
01:39:49,441 --> 01:39:52,770
you see so much bitterness and anger and
social media and you know,

2480
01:39:52,771 --> 01:39:53,604
we talked about this mechanism that 
social media allows people to 

2481
01:39:56,521 --> 01:39:57,354
communicate in this really cruel way 
without experiencing that person right 

2482
01:40:00,331 --> 01:40:00,870
in front of you.

2483
01:40:00,870 --> 01:40:02,790
Right.
But I think one of the reasons why these

2484
01:40:02,791 --> 01:40:03,624
people have this deep seated anger and 
resentment is there's a bunch of people 

2485
01:40:06,331 --> 01:40:07,164
out there that have these lives that are
deeply unsatisfying because I think 

2486
01:40:12,060 --> 01:40:12,893
somehow or another through momentum and 
just through just things falling into 

2487
01:40:16,741 --> 01:40:17,574
place the way they are and people trying
to fit their lives around the way these 

2488
01:40:20,791 --> 01:40:21,624
pieces have fallen into place,
there are so many people that are 

2489
01:40:23,791 --> 01:40:28,791
working all day long doing something 
that is deeply unsatisfying and,

2490
01:40:29,210 --> 01:40:31,210
and almost painful to them.
Yeah.

2491
01:40:31,211 --> 01:40:32,610
Soul killing,
soul killing.

2492
01:40:32,611 --> 01:40:33,444
They're stuck in traffic all day and 
then they're stuck in a cubicle after 

2493
01:40:36,151 --> 01:40:37,020
that.
They,

2494
01:40:37,070 --> 01:40:37,670
they,
they,

2495
01:40:37,670 --> 01:40:41,490
they relish the time to take a shit in 
the bathroom and look at their phone.

2496
01:40:41,640 --> 01:40:42,870
I mean,
they literally do that.

2497
01:40:42,871 --> 01:40:46,980
That's a highlight of someone's day.
They get in traffic on the way home.

2498
01:40:46,981 --> 01:40:47,814
They get home after that,
they're watching television and they're 

2499
01:40:49,471 --> 01:40:51,450
fucked.
They have deep debt.

2500
01:40:51,480 --> 01:40:54,010
This is not like there's this soul 
killing thing is not giving

2501
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:55,690
them any three.
That's huge and you know what?

2502
01:40:55,730 --> 01:40:56,563
You just sit there and go in and you 
look at what people make and you sit 

2503
01:40:58,121 --> 01:40:58,954
there and go,
you can make quite a lot of money by 

2504
01:41:01,481 --> 01:41:04,700
average Joe Standards and still not be 
in good shape.

2505
01:41:05,050 --> 01:41:07,090
So I know people turn around and make 
good living,

2506
01:41:07,091 --> 01:41:08,410
really good living and turn around and 
go,

2507
01:41:08,470 --> 01:41:11,110
I'm just holding my head above water.
And so you go,

2508
01:41:11,111 --> 01:41:13,210
okay,
if you're holding your head just barely,

2509
01:41:13,450 --> 01:41:16,690
what's a person making a third or a 
quarter of what you're making doing?

2510
01:41:16,900 --> 01:41:18,220
I mean,
this is really,

2511
01:41:18,310 --> 01:41:19,143
when you talk about revolutions 
happening in [inaudible] and things 

2512
01:41:21,641 --> 01:41:23,410
going down in weird,
unpredictable,

2513
01:41:23,411 --> 01:41:26,080
negative ways.
You and we've talked about this before,

2514
01:41:26,200 --> 01:41:27,033
you let enough of your society fall into
the loser class for lack of a better 

2515
01:41:30,821 --> 01:41:32,380
word,
winners and losers in society.

2516
01:41:32,620 --> 01:41:33,453
If you,
every society can suck up a certain 

2517
01:41:34,961 --> 01:41:38,830
amount of people not able to to make it,
but if that number gets large enough,

2518
01:41:39,070 --> 01:41:40,060
revolutions happen.

2519
01:41:40,240 --> 01:41:41,073
I think so too,
but I think the revolution doesn't 

2520
01:41:42,251 --> 01:41:43,084
necessarily have to be violent.
I think the revolution can be a 

2521
01:41:45,221 --> 01:41:46,054
revolution of action and ideas and I 
think that there's a ton of people out 

2522
01:41:48,611 --> 01:41:49,444
there that are probably listening to 
this that would like to be able to do 

2523
01:41:51,911 --> 01:41:54,340
something else.
Whether it's make furniture,

2524
01:41:54,370 --> 01:41:55,480
well,
they don't want a revolution.

2525
01:41:55,481 --> 01:41:56,950
They want to do something that's not 
sold.

2526
01:41:57,670 --> 01:42:00,790
If you make furniture,
you make furniture for a living and you,

2527
01:42:00,791 --> 01:42:04,030
you feel a great satisfaction out of 
that and you sell that furniture.

2528
01:42:04,180 --> 01:42:06,490
Look man for making furniture feels 
good.

2529
01:42:06,670 --> 01:42:07,750
If you can do that,
you could,

2530
01:42:07,870 --> 01:42:08,703
you could cut those corners perfectly 
and sand everything down nice and stain 

2531
01:42:11,471 --> 01:42:12,304
it and then it's done and you get 
dissatisfied and you sell it to someone 

2532
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:15,633
and that pays your bills.
That is infinitely more satisfying than 

2533
01:42:18,941 --> 01:42:19,774
being stuck in some fucking cubicle 
working for someone that you don't want 

2534
01:42:21,851 --> 01:42:22,510
to work for.

2535
01:42:22,510 --> 01:42:24,790
Having to have these stupid fucking 
office meetings,

2536
01:42:24,791 --> 01:42:29,080
talking to people in human resources,
sitting down with your supervisor,

2537
01:42:29,081 --> 01:42:31,960
where they evaluate your job performance
and you know,

2538
01:42:31,961 --> 01:42:32,890
you're not really,
you know,

2539
01:42:32,930 --> 01:42:36,100
you really need to be enthusiastic about
this company,

2540
01:42:36,101 --> 01:42:37,890
this company is your future.
This kind of like,

2541
01:42:37,891 --> 01:42:38,830
and you're like,
fuck,

2542
01:42:38,860 --> 01:42:40,270
kill me now.
You know,

2543
01:42:40,271 --> 01:42:43,150
there's a lot of people out there that 
would way rather do something else.

2544
01:42:43,151 --> 01:42:45,940
And I hope they understand that they 
can.

2545
01:42:46,120 --> 01:42:47,830
And that's what's funny about that cause
we were in,

2546
01:42:48,790 --> 01:42:51,610
because we've been talking about us and 
podcasting in new medium,

2547
01:42:51,611 --> 01:42:52,180
whatever.
But,

2548
01:42:52,180 --> 01:42:53,200
but really,
and I tell,

2549
01:42:53,201 --> 01:42:55,150
I give,
I rarely like to give advice because you

2550
01:42:55,151 --> 01:42:55,984
know,
you don't wanna you don't wanna be 

2551
01:42:56,291 --> 01:42:58,870
responsible for people acting on it and 
having it not turn out well.

2552
01:42:59,080 --> 01:43:00,880
But what I tell people is two things.
Right now,

2553
01:43:00,881 --> 01:43:01,714
the United States of America,
the way it's built is built to help 

2554
01:43:05,020 --> 01:43:08,140
industry and corporations and companies.

2555
01:43:08,410 --> 01:43:10,720
But that doesn't necessarily mean it has
to be Microsoft.

2556
01:43:10,721 --> 01:43:12,020
It can be you,
right?

2557
01:43:12,100 --> 01:43:12,933
You can have your own.
And let's talk about the furniture 

2558
01:43:14,801 --> 01:43:15,850
builder.
Once upon a time,

2559
01:43:15,851 --> 01:43:16,684
there are huge things in your way,
including needing to get loans and all 

2560
01:43:19,631 --> 01:43:21,250
these other things to just start a 
business.

2561
01:43:21,370 --> 01:43:23,840
So you're behind the eight ball right 
away and the pressures on,

2562
01:43:23,841 --> 01:43:24,940
because if it doesn't work,
you're in debt.

2563
01:43:25,210 --> 01:43:28,390
Whereas we started these podcasts,
there's no brick or mortar.

2564
01:43:28,391 --> 01:43:29,580
I mean,
now you've got just the,

2565
01:43:29,630 --> 01:43:30,970
the,
the Rogan Tower.

2566
01:43:30,971 --> 01:43:31,804
It's a little bit different,
but once upon a time it's like in the 

2567
01:43:33,701 --> 01:43:34,534
back of your bedroom and you've got a 
company and it's got a show and people 

2568
01:43:36,371 --> 01:43:38,560
are listening.
If you make your furniture and you don't

2569
01:43:38,561 --> 01:43:41,110
have to have a brick and mortar store,
but you can put a website up,

2570
01:43:41,330 --> 01:43:43,300
uh,
make it with squarespace or one of those

2571
01:43:43,301 --> 01:43:46,810
other things and all of a sudden you 
have a business out of your house.

2572
01:43:47,320 --> 01:43:49,510
The freedom,
the satisfaction,

2573
01:43:49,630 --> 01:43:52,070
the ability to set your own hours.
And here's the best part,

2574
01:43:52,220 --> 01:43:53,053
the fact that if you start making a lot 
of money somehow you're not going to 

2575
01:43:56,061 --> 01:43:56,894
have your boss cut your commissions.
I mean I knew sales guys who made so 

2576
01:43:59,391 --> 01:44:00,224
much money that their bosses cut their 
commissions cause you can't make more 

2577
01:44:02,541 --> 01:44:04,400
than your bosses.
Well listen,

2578
01:44:04,401 --> 01:44:06,530
when you have your own small business,
the sky is the limit.

2579
01:44:06,531 --> 01:44:09,050
If you make $10 million,
you make $10 million.

2580
01:44:09,370 --> 01:44:10,203
So I always tell people that if you can,
and it's not always something they can 

2581
01:44:12,801 --> 01:44:13,634
do,
maybe you do it on the side when you've 

2582
01:44:14,301 --> 01:44:15,134
got your regular job.
Starting a small business now in this 

2583
01:44:18,021 --> 01:44:21,170
climate that we have right now is not 
only possible,

2584
01:44:21,740 --> 01:44:25,160
it's not that much of a gamble.
Because if worst comes to worst,

2585
01:44:25,161 --> 01:44:25,994
you didn't invest $100,000
you didn't have starting at all the 

2586
01:44:28,671 --> 01:44:29,504
time,
right?

2587
01:44:29,630 --> 01:44:31,370
I mean that website didn't cost you that
much.

2588
01:44:31,371 --> 01:44:31,950
You know,
the,

2589
01:44:31,950 --> 01:44:34,220
the investment for the tools you may 
have had already.

2590
01:44:34,330 --> 01:44:35,163
Podcasting is a perfect example.
We make business like my buddy says we 

2591
01:44:37,851 --> 01:44:40,610
sell Zeros and ones.
That's what we do.

2592
01:44:40,640 --> 01:44:41,473
Well,
it's been never been easier to have a 

2593
01:44:42,021 --> 01:44:44,420
website either knows or with companies 
like squarespace,

2594
01:44:44,421 --> 01:44:45,254
you can develop a website.
You could literally build amazing 

2595
01:44:46,760 --> 01:44:50,800
website and sell your furniture and you 
have a free online store with it and you

2596
01:44:50,840 --> 01:44:51,673
put you,
they have these drag and drop user 

2597
01:44:53,061 --> 01:44:53,894
interfaces.
You use photos and drag them onto their 

2598
01:44:55,761 --> 01:44:57,170
sides and in place,
boom.

2599
01:44:57,320 --> 01:44:58,670
Next thing you know you've got a 
website,

2600
01:44:58,671 --> 01:45:01,190
so your furniture.
So whatever the fuck you make,

2601
01:45:01,191 --> 01:45:04,520
whether you make clothes or you're 
designing backpacks or there's,

2602
01:45:04,550 --> 01:45:08,600
there's a lot of people out there that 
have interests and they've never pursued

2603
01:45:08,601 --> 01:45:13,601
those interests because they're fucking 
tired from doing some higher soul suck.

2604
01:45:13,610 --> 01:45:14,443
It's hard to go to work and put your 
effort into that and then come home and 

2605
01:45:17,301 --> 01:45:18,980
then work for yourself.
It's very hard.

2606
01:45:18,981 --> 01:45:20,200
But I'll tell you what,
there's,

2607
01:45:20,260 --> 01:45:21,500
there's a part,
like you said,

2608
01:45:21,501 --> 01:45:25,130
there's a part of it that once you start
making stuff for yourself,

2609
01:45:25,340 --> 01:45:27,040
that self motivating,
right?

2610
01:45:27,140 --> 01:45:27,973
Like I told somebody to start a podcast 
and I said the first time you get some 

2611
01:45:30,141 --> 01:45:33,530
feedback email that will kick you in the
rear end to keep doing the pie.

2612
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:34,850
It becomes,
it becomes,

2613
01:45:34,851 --> 01:45:35,450
um,
you know,

2614
01:45:35,450 --> 01:45:37,280
life is a verb,
I always say.

2615
01:45:37,281 --> 01:45:38,114
And you have to actually act,
but by acting you change everything in 

2616
01:45:41,781 --> 01:45:43,010
your future.
Um,

2617
01:45:43,011 --> 01:45:44,330
another guy said to me,
it's a great line.

2618
01:45:44,331 --> 01:45:45,164
He said with podcasts,
it's not always how many people are 

2619
01:45:46,491 --> 01:45:48,380
listening.
Sometimes it's who they are,

2620
01:45:48,710 --> 01:45:49,543
right?
So my grandmother's philosophy was 

2621
01:45:50,781 --> 01:45:52,550
always that you should keep walking and 
talking.

2622
01:45:52,580 --> 01:45:53,413
But in her era,
walking and talking meant going and 

2623
01:45:54,801 --> 01:45:58,160
shaking people's hands.
And now you can network like through the

2624
01:45:58,161 --> 01:46:00,410
Internet and you never really shaking 
people's hands.

2625
01:46:00,590 --> 01:46:02,780
But you may have a podcast for the only 
a hundred listeners,

2626
01:46:02,870 --> 01:46:05,480
but if one of those listeners,
just some guy somewhere else who says,

2627
01:46:05,510 --> 01:46:07,340
oh my God,
this guy's furniture is great,

2628
01:46:07,341 --> 01:46:08,450
or whatever,
I'm going to,

2629
01:46:08,510 --> 01:46:09,343
I'm gonna,
maybe you can come and start giving a 

2630
01:46:10,251 --> 01:46:11,840
pottery barn.
You know what I mean?

2631
01:46:11,841 --> 01:46:12,674
Things open up in ways that you can't 
predict because you started doing 

2632
01:46:15,531 --> 01:46:16,364
something and because you have 
legitimate passion for what you can in 

2633
01:46:19,081 --> 01:46:21,050
that resonates.
Doesn't it feel experience that?

2634
01:46:21,120 --> 01:46:22,610
Yeah,
if they seem fine.

2635
01:46:22,640 --> 01:46:23,473
I mean,
I can't tell you how many artists that 

2636
01:46:24,531 --> 01:46:28,370
I've discovered online just through 
instagram or through twitter,

2637
01:46:28,371 --> 01:46:31,340
like this isn't sent me to creative 
revolution in a,

2638
01:46:31,390 --> 01:46:33,410
in an amazing way.
And I hope,

2639
01:46:33,530 --> 01:46:36,260
and I think there's way more creative 
people out there,

2640
01:46:36,261 --> 01:46:37,340
then we realize,
Oh yes,

2641
01:46:37,341 --> 01:46:39,590
absolutely.
And I think they would love to have some

2642
01:46:39,591 --> 01:46:41,030
sort of an opportunity to do something 
like that.

2643
01:46:41,031 --> 01:46:43,040
And especially like an artist,
someone who is an artist,

2644
01:46:43,250 --> 01:46:44,083
man,
there's never been a better time to be 

2645
01:46:45,021 --> 01:46:47,840
an artist because you could showcase 
your work and,

2646
01:46:47,841 --> 01:46:48,830
and,
and look,

2647
01:46:48,831 --> 01:46:50,220
if you send me something cool

2648
01:46:50,370 --> 01:46:53,920
and you know,
he sent it to me on twitter or I'll do,

2649
01:46:53,990 --> 01:46:54,823
we treat things all the time.
And all that takes is someone else has 

2650
01:46:57,661 --> 01:46:58,471
to see that and say,
wow,

2651
01:46:58,471 --> 01:46:59,620
that's amazing.
And then two,

2652
01:46:59,621 --> 01:46:59,911
two,
two,

2653
01:46:59,911 --> 01:47:00,181
two,
two,

2654
01:47:00,181 --> 01:47:00,540
two,
two.

2655
01:47:00,540 --> 01:47:01,373
It just propagates to all these 
different people's instagram feeds and 

2656
01:47:03,991 --> 01:47:05,220
all these people,
twitter feeds.

2657
01:47:05,221 --> 01:47:06,054
And next thing you know,
you've got a business and you're up and 

2658
01:47:07,441 --> 01:47:09,930
running and it's not going to be easy 
and it's not going to be quick.

2659
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:12,050
But the job you're doing now,
ladies,

2660
01:47:12,070 --> 01:47:13,440
your cricket,
the soul killing one,

2661
01:47:13,441 --> 01:47:15,330
eight easier quickie that people think 
like,

2662
01:47:15,331 --> 01:47:16,710
oh,
how long is it going to take?

2663
01:47:16,740 --> 01:47:17,573
Oh,
but you know when you start out doing a 

2664
01:47:18,721 --> 01:47:20,640
podcast,
when we got turned downloads,

2665
01:47:20,850 --> 01:47:23,520
well that's how it works.
Next call where there was,

2666
01:47:23,730 --> 01:47:24,870
I was there once.
Dude,

2667
01:47:24,871 --> 01:47:25,970
when we first did it,
when we,

2668
01:47:25,971 --> 01:47:26,804
we,
when Brian and I were first doing this 

2669
01:47:28,591 --> 01:47:31,320
podcast and we were doing it on like 
Ustream,

2670
01:47:31,321 --> 01:47:35,970
we would have 200 viewers and I wasn't 
doing it for money.

2671
01:47:36,150 --> 01:47:39,810
I wasn't.
I was literally doing it because my,

2672
01:47:40,200 --> 01:47:41,033
my wife had gotten pregnant.
We had to move from Colorado back to La 

2673
01:47:44,941 --> 01:47:46,590
and I was bummed out and I was like,
fuck,

2674
01:47:46,591 --> 01:47:49,830
I thought I escaped.
I thought I got out of La,

2675
01:47:49,831 --> 01:47:51,240
I was living in the mountains.
I was like,

2676
01:47:51,241 --> 01:47:52,920
this is what I want.
I want to be in nature.

2677
01:47:53,190 --> 01:47:54,023
I was like,
I don't want to be back in this fucking 

2678
01:47:54,751 --> 01:47:56,100
hell hole.
Like all right,

2679
01:47:56,101 --> 01:47:56,934
let's do something.
And so we started doing podcasts just 

2680
01:47:58,921 --> 01:47:59,754
for a goof cause I was doing stand up.
That was all well and good and how it 

2681
01:48:02,431 --> 01:48:03,950
tied into your standups on,
yeah.

2682
01:48:04,080 --> 01:48:05,970
Well,
but it started,

2683
01:48:05,971 --> 01:48:06,804
my point is it didn't start out.
I didn't start out thinking this is 

2684
01:48:09,721 --> 01:48:12,360
going to replace my income.
This is going to be,

2685
01:48:12,390 --> 01:48:17,390
I just did it as a passion project and I
think if people have a regular day job,

2686
01:48:17,581 --> 01:48:18,414
if you could just find some one thing 
that you do as a passion project and 

2687
01:48:20,941 --> 01:48:24,780
just keep building on it,
just keep at cheap watering it,

2688
01:48:24,870 --> 01:48:27,330
keep adding fertilizer,
keep giving it attention,

2689
01:48:27,331 --> 01:48:28,164
keep giving it focus and you can escape,
you can escape and you can be self 

2690
01:48:31,231 --> 01:48:31,650
serving.

2691
01:48:31,650 --> 01:48:33,240
You could be okay.
You're going to be okay.

2692
01:48:33,300 --> 01:48:35,970
I always ask people when they want to 
start it like a podcast.

2693
01:48:35,971 --> 01:48:36,804
I'll say something like,
how many listeners would you have to 

2694
01:48:38,041 --> 01:48:40,140
have for you to care?
Right?

2695
01:48:40,690 --> 01:48:42,900
And that's an magic number that's 
different for everybody,

2696
01:48:42,901 --> 01:48:43,770
right?
But,

2697
01:48:43,800 --> 01:48:44,633
but what,
what's great about what we do that's 

2698
01:48:46,531 --> 01:48:51,000
different from broadcasting is that 
there is a giant pie of people.

2699
01:48:51,001 --> 01:48:51,834
Let's pretend it's a billion.
And if you're going to do a podcast on 

2700
01:48:56,611 --> 01:48:57,444
science fiction comic books from the 
1950s or something that there's such a 

2701
01:49:00,421 --> 01:49:01,254
narrow audience,
they'd never put it on television 

2702
01:49:02,321 --> 01:49:03,480
because it's,
it's too narrow.

2703
01:49:03,810 --> 01:49:07,230
You will be able,
if you even get 0.01%

2704
01:49:07,231 --> 01:49:08,064
of that billion pie,
it's not only going to be a decent 

2705
01:49:10,231 --> 01:49:13,380
number of people in terms of what you 
would think is successful,

2706
01:49:13,620 --> 01:49:14,453
but they're going to be so enthusiastic 
because this is an outlet that they 

2707
01:49:17,791 --> 01:49:19,260
don't have.
It's like I always tell somebody,

2708
01:49:19,261 --> 01:49:21,930
if you're into Harry Potter,
what are the TV networks given you?

2709
01:49:22,170 --> 01:49:24,420
But there's multiple Harry Potter 
podcasts.

2710
01:49:24,450 --> 01:49:26,060
Listen to this.
You want to hear something crazy.

2711
01:49:26,150 --> 01:49:26,983
Time magazine just had some top 50 
podcast thing and a buddy of mine who 

2712
01:49:30,391 --> 01:49:32,880
was angry that he wasn't on,
sent me some stuff about it.

2713
01:49:33,210 --> 01:49:34,470
And uh,
one of the things he said,

2714
01:49:34,471 --> 01:49:35,304
dude,
there's a fucking podcast on there 

2715
01:49:36,271 --> 01:49:37,104
called the Gilmore boys.
That's guys two guys sitting around 

2716
01:49:40,830 --> 01:49:43,650
talking about the Gilmore Girls 
Television show.

2717
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:47,710
There's another one called something 
about Richard Simmons where there's

2718
01:49:48,070 --> 01:49:49,540
finding Richardson,
Richard Simmons,

2719
01:49:49,810 --> 01:49:53,050
where they're trying to figure out why 
Richard Simmons went into hiding.

2720
01:49:53,080 --> 01:49:55,090
What's so great about that idea though,
and again,

2721
01:49:55,091 --> 01:49:55,924
and you at home can learn this too.
What's so great about that idea is that 

2722
01:49:58,631 --> 01:50:03,631
they instantly tied their podcast to 
somebody who already had tons of fan,

2723
01:50:04,440 --> 01:50:05,650
right?
So you sit there and go,

2724
01:50:05,651 --> 01:50:07,100
I don't know who these guys are or what 
this spot,

2725
01:50:07,120 --> 01:50:09,220
but I'm a huge Richard Simmons Fan.
So I'll listen.

2726
01:50:09,430 --> 01:50:12,970
And that's like instant audience.
Isn't this another podcast called guys?

2727
01:50:12,971 --> 01:50:16,060
We fucked these girls cramp came up with
this podcast.

2728
01:50:16,061 --> 01:50:20,080
And this is one that I always use an as 
example because these who were the girls

2729
01:50:20,081 --> 01:50:20,920
from God's,
we fucked.

2730
01:50:21,390 --> 01:50:22,240
You see it?
Find the names.

2731
01:50:22,610 --> 01:50:23,590
Um,
these,

2732
01:50:23,591 --> 01:50:25,060
uh,
comedians from New York,

2733
01:50:25,061 --> 01:50:27,010
they came and they actually going to be 
on the podcast Monday.

2734
01:50:27,730 --> 01:50:29,020
Oh,
that was a clever tie.

2735
01:50:29,021 --> 01:50:32,620
And I didn't mean to,
but I used them as an example because,

2736
01:50:32,910 --> 01:50:35,770
cause we just booked this earlier today.

2737
01:50:36,190 --> 01:50:38,140
Christina Hutchinson and Corinne 
[inaudible],

2738
01:50:38,260 --> 01:50:39,093
Jimmy Curran Fisher,
and they came up with this clever idea 

2739
01:50:41,831 --> 01:50:42,664
for the title and it became huge and me,
it's always top 10 it's like one of the 

2740
01:50:46,841 --> 01:50:49,330
top 10 comedy podcasts and people say,
oh well too,

2741
01:50:49,331 --> 01:50:51,010
it's a traded.
No it's not stupid.

2742
01:50:51,240 --> 01:50:52,750
You just just to do something that's 
good.

2743
01:50:52,751 --> 01:50:54,460
Stop saying it's saturated.
If you're good,

2744
01:50:54,461 --> 01:50:57,870
it'll stand out.
This idea that [inaudible],

2745
01:50:58,150 --> 01:51:01,270
everybody's got these stupid barriers 
they put in their own head.

2746
01:51:01,410 --> 01:51:02,243
You've got to resist those goddamn 
things cause they don't do you any good 

2747
01:51:04,450 --> 01:51:08,230
and they certainly defined the potential
for your future in a negative way that's

2748
01:51:08,231 --> 01:51:10,630
not self serving and it's not even real.
You know,

2749
01:51:10,631 --> 01:51:11,051
you've,
you've,

2750
01:51:11,051 --> 01:51:11,884
you've,
you've put this artificial ceiling on 

2751
01:51:13,661 --> 01:51:16,660
the potential for what you're doing.
If you hit a wall,

2752
01:51:16,840 --> 01:51:17,673
okay,
that just means you need to regroup and 

2753
01:51:18,761 --> 01:51:20,950
rethink.
It doesn't mean that wall's there.

2754
01:51:21,100 --> 01:51:24,610
Especially when it comes to something 
like social media or like a podcast,

2755
01:51:24,820 --> 01:51:27,190
something where you're just,
you're putting out a piece of art,

2756
01:51:27,191 --> 01:51:28,720
you're putting out something that you've
created.

2757
01:51:28,960 --> 01:51:29,793
There's no wall as far as like how many 
people are gonna enjoy it or how far 

2758
01:51:32,441 --> 01:51:33,700
it's gonna go.
It's just,

2759
01:51:33,910 --> 01:51:36,820
it is what it is.
And if people don't like it,

2760
01:51:36,821 --> 01:51:39,790
make it better.
If they like it less fixed that,

2761
01:51:40,080 --> 01:51:42,310
figure out a way to do it.
You can do that.

2762
01:51:42,340 --> 01:51:43,173
And this,
this idea that there's no way to get 

2763
01:51:45,461 --> 01:51:48,400
past the starting block today is just 
ludicrous.

2764
01:51:48,401 --> 01:51:49,840
It's crazy.
And it's just this,

2765
01:51:50,110 --> 01:51:55,030
this poor thinking and people that are 
trapped in bad situations,

2766
01:51:55,390 --> 01:51:58,810
one of the problems is you feel like 
this is your future.

2767
01:51:58,840 --> 01:52:00,850
You feel like you're fucked and you 
can't get out of that.

2768
01:52:00,851 --> 01:52:01,684
There's no hope.
There's no light at the end of the 

2769
01:52:02,801 --> 01:52:03,190
tunnel.

2770
01:52:03,190 --> 01:52:06,130
There's no rainbow.
And if you feel like that,

2771
01:52:06,131 --> 01:52:09,340
that alone can be incredibly defining 
and limiting.

2772
01:52:09,580 --> 01:52:10,413
But if you can look at,
if you look at yourself objectively and 

2773
01:52:12,851 --> 01:52:13,330
say,
okay,

2774
01:52:13,330 --> 01:52:14,890
I Connie,
I am fucked here.

2775
01:52:15,070 --> 01:52:17,830
I'm in credit card debt.
I'm working in a shitty job.

2776
01:52:18,050 --> 01:52:18,883
I don't like what I'm doing,
but I have some ideas I need to feed 

2777
01:52:22,781 --> 01:52:25,270
those fucking ideas and that I need to 
feed them.

2778
01:52:25,271 --> 01:52:30,010
And water them and I need to set aside a
certain amount of time every day to just

2779
01:52:30,190 --> 01:52:32,890
try to make those things happen.
You can do that.

2780
01:52:33,340 --> 01:52:35,410
I have a wii.
I like visual images.

2781
01:52:35,411 --> 01:52:36,244
You know,
we use that in the hardcore history a 

2782
01:52:36,641 --> 01:52:36,921
lot.
These,

2783
01:52:36,921 --> 01:52:38,320
you know,
what's it like to fight an elephant with

2784
01:52:38,321 --> 01:52:39,650
a spear and things like that.
I like,

2785
01:52:39,990 --> 01:52:41,950
but the image to die,
that's what it's like.

2786
01:52:42,330 --> 01:52:44,260
The image I have though for what you're 
talking about.

2787
01:52:44,261 --> 01:52:45,980
I've always thought it's a little like a

2788
01:52:45,980 --> 01:52:50,330
running back in football who takes the 
ball and who goes forward and there's no

2789
01:52:50,331 --> 01:52:50,871
hole,
right?

2790
01:52:50,871 --> 01:52:53,000
All you run into is the back of your 
offensive linemen,

2791
01:52:53,001 --> 01:52:56,370
but if you keep hitting,
if a hole is going to open up,

2792
01:52:56,390 --> 01:52:57,410
boom,
you'll squirt through.

2793
01:52:57,470 --> 01:52:59,630
Now there's no guarantee in life.
The whole will be there.

2794
01:52:59,840 --> 01:53:02,720
But there is a guarantee that if you're 
not continually smacking at it,

2795
01:53:02,930 --> 01:53:04,340
then when it opens up,
you won't be ready.

2796
01:53:04,550 --> 01:53:05,150
Right,
right.

2797
01:53:05,150 --> 01:53:06,620
And so I don't know about you,
Joe.

2798
01:53:06,621 --> 01:53:08,960
You've had a charmed life I think,
and how well you've done.

2799
01:53:08,961 --> 01:53:10,700
But I mean,
some of us have failed many times.

2800
01:53:10,760 --> 01:53:11,593
I've failed at a bunch of shit.
But I guess what I'm saying is I 

2801
01:53:14,661 --> 01:53:17,000
remember being a TV reporter at a small 
station,

2802
01:53:17,070 --> 01:53:17,510
uh,
and,

2803
01:53:17,510 --> 01:53:20,630
and I would get out of work at like 
midnight and the Sh and the story that I

2804
01:53:20,631 --> 01:53:23,030
just spent all day on aired and it was 
awful.

2805
01:53:23,330 --> 01:53:25,430
And I would get out and I would 
literally,

2806
01:53:25,431 --> 01:53:27,110
this is when I still had quite a bit of 
hair.

2807
01:53:27,111 --> 01:53:29,300
I would sit there and like you like pull
your hair out,

2808
01:53:29,301 --> 01:53:30,530
you go,
what am I doing?

2809
01:53:30,590 --> 01:53:31,011
Right,
right.

2810
01:53:31,011 --> 01:53:31,844
This is horrible.
And I look back on those now and I 

2811
01:53:34,191 --> 01:53:34,701
think,
you know,

2812
01:53:34,701 --> 01:53:38,030
what if you had just given up then,
right,

2813
01:53:38,310 --> 01:53:39,440
or the podcast,
I mean,

2814
01:53:39,710 --> 01:53:41,780
do you know how my wife did a great 
thing for me?

2815
01:53:41,810 --> 01:53:42,171
Uh,
we,

2816
01:53:42,171 --> 01:53:43,004
we,
we'd had that company that I just told 

2817
01:53:43,911 --> 01:53:45,410
you about it.
We were trying to do the new media thing

2818
01:53:45,411 --> 01:53:48,200
and it just fell apart like everybody's 
companies were starting to do.

2819
01:53:48,710 --> 01:53:49,543
And I wasted a lot of time.
And a lot of money in my life doing 

2820
01:53:51,111 --> 01:53:51,944
that.
And she would have been totally 

2821
01:53:52,881 --> 01:53:53,714
justified in saying that's it.
You know you're going to Indianapolis 

2822
01:53:55,911 --> 01:53:57,890
gonna a talk radio show job wherever 
they're higher.

2823
01:53:58,130 --> 01:53:59,390
But she did and she said,
you know what,

2824
01:53:59,391 --> 01:54:01,280
you tried to try this next thing,
you could do it,

2825
01:54:01,281 --> 01:54:03,560
you can and here we are.
And I think,

2826
01:54:03,561 --> 01:54:05,300
you know,
if you hadn't tried,

2827
01:54:05,330 --> 01:54:07,190
it's that weird thing of it.
And folks,

2828
01:54:07,340 --> 01:54:08,960
I tried being a TV reporter,
I'd try b.

2829
01:54:09,080 --> 01:54:09,913
You try all those things and either 
they're not successful or they're 

2830
01:54:11,901 --> 01:54:15,120
moderately successful or they're 
successful but not enough for you.

2831
01:54:15,610 --> 01:54:17,780
You got life is a verb.
You have to,

2832
01:54:18,200 --> 01:54:22,070
you know the thing that people that 
makes people the most sad in life.

2833
01:54:22,071 --> 01:54:25,400
And I already have a couple of friends 
my own age who are there is the regrets,

2834
01:54:25,610 --> 01:54:26,360
right?
They don't,

2835
01:54:26,360 --> 01:54:27,860
they don't,
they're not sorry,

2836
01:54:27,861 --> 01:54:30,080
they failed.
They're sorry they didn't try.

2837
01:54:30,500 --> 01:54:33,170
And the funny thing is there,
some of them are only 50 and they think,

2838
01:54:33,171 --> 01:54:33,860
okay,
my my,

2839
01:54:33,860 --> 01:54:35,720
my window to try is already gone.

2840
01:54:35,720 --> 01:54:37,730
And which is wrong too.
But folks,

2841
01:54:37,731 --> 01:54:38,564
you will be so happy.
There's so many things that have 

2842
01:54:39,441 --> 01:54:40,274
happened in my life because I,
I mean I got my first talk radio show 

2843
01:54:42,291 --> 01:54:43,040
job.
I was,

2844
01:54:43,040 --> 01:54:44,750
I was a reporter.
I covered the story.

2845
01:54:44,751 --> 01:54:47,180
There was some big guy showing up at the
local radio station.

2846
01:54:47,490 --> 01:54:48,323
As I was leaving,
I wrote a letter to the program 

2847
01:54:49,851 --> 01:54:51,680
director.
Just say thanks for having us to thought

2848
01:54:52,100 --> 01:54:55,520
do I may have this joint not mail it.
Do I mainly do it and just,

2849
01:54:55,521 --> 01:54:56,354
you know,
I closed my eyes and a male that he 

2850
01:54:57,111 --> 01:54:58,100
called me two days later.
He said,

2851
01:54:58,101 --> 01:55:00,950
you want a job?
What if you didn't send that letter?

2852
01:55:00,951 --> 01:55:01,784
It's a stupid,
the little things that your life can 

2853
01:55:03,411 --> 01:55:08,411
hinge on but if you don't do them you 
don't give and opportunity to intervene.

2854
01:55:08,820 --> 01:55:11,700
I think here's an important thing to 
failure is important.

2855
01:55:11,701 --> 01:55:12,534
It is important.
I think failure teaches you things that 

2856
01:55:14,041 --> 01:55:17,670
you don't learn from success.
I think failure gives you an opportunity

2857
01:55:17,671 --> 01:55:22,020
for self examination and also gives you 
a feeling that is very uncomfortable and

2858
01:55:22,021 --> 01:55:22,854
that very uncomfortable feeling helps 
you grow that when you feel like shit 

2859
01:55:25,831 --> 01:55:28,320
and you screw something up.
Like when I've had bad podcasts,

2860
01:55:28,470 --> 01:55:30,120
my podcast has always gotten better 
afterwards.

2861
01:55:30,121 --> 01:55:30,954
When I've had bad standup sets,
I've always gotten better after that 

2862
01:55:33,001 --> 01:55:35,370
because those bad sets motivate you.
They get,

2863
01:55:35,520 --> 01:55:37,260
they give you a perspective like,
Hey,

2864
01:55:37,440 --> 01:55:40,110
here's some clear examples of where you 
fucked up,

2865
01:55:40,280 --> 01:55:44,340
what not to do.
Don't and don't look these failures

2866
01:55:44,340 --> 01:55:45,173
as like proof that you suck.
Look at them as opportunities for 

2867
01:55:48,451 --> 01:55:49,284
growth.
Look at them as opportunities to be 

2868
01:55:50,641 --> 01:55:51,474
motivated to do better.
And Winston Churchill had a line about 

2869
01:55:53,611 --> 01:55:57,840
reading quotes about how inspirational 
reading famous quotes were.

2870
01:55:58,170 --> 01:56:00,990
And he says they motivate you from a 
number of different ways,

2871
01:56:00,991 --> 01:56:01,824
including the idea that you know,
you think it's just you or you think 

2872
01:56:04,261 --> 01:56:07,800
that these people who did so well,
we're so incredibly gifted or privileged

2873
01:56:07,801 --> 01:56:09,270
from the get go.
And when you realize,

2874
01:56:09,271 --> 01:56:09,521
no,
no,

2875
01:56:09,521 --> 01:56:10,354
no,
they're more like me than I think that 

2876
01:56:11,281 --> 01:56:12,900
becomes inspirational.
Right?

2877
01:56:13,050 --> 01:56:15,480
You telling your audience,
this is inspirational.

2878
01:56:15,780 --> 01:56:17,450
You don't want to hear,
go back to school,

2879
01:56:17,460 --> 01:56:20,130
go to this word note,
but if you hate your job,

2880
01:56:20,131 --> 01:56:20,964
that is like nature telling you to try 
something different and it's motivating 

2881
01:56:23,971 --> 01:56:24,804
because the motivation is you might not 
have to do that soul killing job 

2882
01:56:27,121 --> 01:56:27,540
anymore.

2883
01:56:27,540 --> 01:56:28,373
Well,
if you look at someone who's doing 

2884
01:56:28,921 --> 01:56:29,754
really well,
I'd say if you focus on like Kevin Hart 

2885
01:56:31,921 --> 01:56:32,754
or something like that,
some very famous and successful 

2886
01:56:34,531 --> 01:56:35,364
comedian,
all you see is him now flying around on 

2887
01:56:38,221 --> 01:56:39,054
private jets wearing a new pair of 
sneakers every day driving around in 

2888
01:56:41,551 --> 01:56:43,410
bentleys.
You just see that.

2889
01:56:43,650 --> 01:56:47,190
You don't see him being a young kid in 
Philadelphia,

2890
01:56:47,191 --> 01:56:50,760
going to open mic nights,
scratching and Clawing Mc Hammer selling

2891
01:56:50,761 --> 01:56:52,370
the tapes out of the hatchback.
Yeah,

2892
01:56:52,380 --> 01:56:53,460
all of that stuff,
man.

2893
01:56:53,490 --> 01:56:54,323
There's a path and you,
we think of people like you see an old 

2894
01:56:57,301 --> 01:56:58,800
person walking down the street,
you go,

2895
01:56:58,801 --> 01:57:00,300
oh,
that person's always been an old person.

2896
01:57:00,301 --> 01:57:02,580
Now that was a baby.
That was a baby.

2897
01:57:02,581 --> 01:57:04,440
That became a 90 year old man.
There's a,

2898
01:57:04,441 --> 01:57:07,200
there's a progression that you are not 
witnessed too.

2899
01:57:07,260 --> 01:57:09,180
You don't see it and that,
that,

2900
01:57:09,181 --> 01:57:10,800
that takes place in everything.

2901
01:57:10,800 --> 01:57:14,460
It takes place in author as it takes 
place in comedians and musicians,

2902
01:57:14,700 --> 01:57:19,410
there is a starting point.
And then with time and focus and as long

2903
01:57:19,411 --> 01:57:20,244
as you reevaluate and reassess and 
constantly objectively look at what 

2904
01:57:24,181 --> 01:57:26,490
you're doing and then pursue it with 
passion and focus,

2905
01:57:26,760 --> 01:57:28,560
you get better at things.
And you know what,

2906
01:57:28,561 --> 01:57:30,390
doing all those things ends up,
you know,

2907
01:57:30,391 --> 01:57:32,580
it's funny,
but your life experiences create who you

2908
01:57:32,581 --> 01:57:35,700
are and all those things actually make 
you a more,

2909
01:57:35,701 --> 01:57:37,020
for me,
I know I'm speaking,

2910
01:57:37,040 --> 01:57:37,873
speaking to the choir here but,
but all those things make you a more 

2911
01:57:39,751 --> 01:57:44,260
formidable person so that eventually 
that next endeavor is,

2912
01:57:44,290 --> 01:57:47,550
is you're more prepared for and you're 
more formidable and,

2913
01:57:47,760 --> 01:57:48,481
and so,
you know,

2914
01:57:48,481 --> 01:57:49,314
you turn around,
you say,

2915
01:57:49,320 --> 01:57:53,970
what was I like as a 23 year old intern 
compared to what I'm like now?

2916
01:57:53,971 --> 01:57:57,510
And I'm basically a different person and
you're a different person because of all

2917
01:57:57,511 --> 01:57:58,650
these life experiences.

2918
01:57:58,650 --> 01:58:01,060
I mean you go to a Centcom meeting with 
the big breath,

2919
01:58:01,090 --> 01:58:02,850
well,
you're more formidable afterwards,

2920
01:58:02,851 --> 01:58:03,900
right?
For sure.

2921
01:58:03,990 --> 01:58:06,300
But if you don't put yourself in the 
position,

2922
01:58:06,301 --> 01:58:08,130
you know it's,
it's life is like coming up to the,

2923
01:58:08,160 --> 01:58:08,993
to the plate and taking a swing.
There are no guarantees you're going to 

2924
01:58:10,861 --> 01:58:12,060
get a hit,
no guarantee.

2925
01:58:12,120 --> 01:58:13,860
And you might even look foolish 
swinging,

2926
01:58:14,100 --> 01:58:16,620
but there's no chance of it if you don't
get in the batter's box.

2927
01:58:16,621 --> 01:58:17,850
Right.
On hundred percent.

2928
01:58:17,851 --> 01:58:21,660
And one of the things that I've found 
over the last few years in particular,

2929
01:58:21,970 --> 01:58:23,370
um,
I've done in the past,

2930
01:58:23,371 --> 01:58:26,460
but I did it because they were just 
goals that I was pursuing on the side as

2931
01:58:26,461 --> 01:58:28,710
well as doing standup and all the other 
things that I do with my life.

2932
01:58:28,950 --> 01:58:29,783
But I've found that things that are 
completely unrelated to my career that 

2933
01:58:32,821 --> 01:58:34,740
are difficult,
enhance what I do,

2934
01:58:35,100 --> 01:58:40,100
whether it's yoga or running hills or 
archery or all these things

2935
01:58:42,340 --> 01:58:45,460
that I incorporate them into what you do
sort of.

2936
01:58:45,640 --> 01:58:46,980
But that's just cause I,
my,

2937
01:58:46,990 --> 01:58:49,630
one of the things that I do is just talk
about things that I'm interested in,

2938
01:58:49,930 --> 01:58:54,520
but they make my,
my focus better because they're hard and

2939
01:58:54,521 --> 01:58:57,670
because I'm not good at them.
So like when I do yoga,

2940
01:58:57,671 --> 01:58:59,860
I'm not good at Yoga.
So when I do it,

2941
01:59:00,040 --> 01:59:01,960
it's hard.
It's a fucking struggle.

2942
01:59:01,961 --> 01:59:02,794
And forcing myself to get through that 
90 minute class and try a 100% with 

2943
01:59:07,511 --> 01:59:12,511
every pose enhances my stamina for 
thinking and approaching other things.

2944
01:59:13,240 --> 01:59:14,073
Let's macro it out a little bit because 
I'm very interested in what you're 

2945
01:59:15,881 --> 01:59:16,510
saying.
So,

2946
01:59:16,510 --> 01:59:18,670
so here you and I are talking to the 
listeners,

2947
01:59:19,240 --> 01:59:21,610
many of whom were already accomplished 
and well into their goals.

2948
01:59:21,611 --> 01:59:23,440
But if they're not,
they're listening to this.

2949
01:59:23,441 --> 01:59:24,670
And I'm thinking to myself,
okay,

2950
01:59:25,030 --> 01:59:27,700
if you're trying to design a society,
you know,

2951
01:59:27,701 --> 01:59:28,990
we had talked about revolution.

2952
01:59:29,030 --> 01:59:31,650
If too many people are,
are the losers in the society.

2953
01:59:32,110 --> 01:59:32,943
If you said to yourself,
what really matters in the society's 

2954
01:59:34,270 --> 01:59:37,180
making more Americans who are happier 
with their lives,

2955
01:59:37,181 --> 01:59:38,800
more successful doing what they want to 
do,

2956
01:59:38,801 --> 01:59:41,560
in other words,
empowering them to create.

2957
01:59:42,460 --> 01:59:43,293
How different is that in terms of a 
setup from what our school system's 

2958
01:59:46,120 --> 01:59:48,670
designed to do now,
which is a hold over to essentially make

2959
01:59:48,671 --> 01:59:50,650
good factory workers,
right?

2960
01:59:50,770 --> 01:59:52,150
I mean if you said to somebody,
listen,

2961
01:59:52,151 --> 01:59:52,984
this entire country is built for you to 
become a businessman with your own 

2962
01:59:56,021 --> 01:59:57,240
business.
You Start Your own club.

2963
01:59:57,430 --> 01:59:58,263
If you taught that in the schools from 
the get go and you had workshops all 

2964
02:00:01,871 --> 02:00:02,920
and,
and everybody's going to say,

2965
02:00:02,921 --> 02:00:04,150
damn,
we already do that in the schools.

2966
02:00:04,151 --> 02:00:04,984
I already know.
But I mean if that was the entire goal 

2967
02:00:06,941 --> 02:00:07,774
of your education to turn every student 
in that class and do a small business 

2968
02:00:10,841 --> 02:00:11,674
person doing their own dreams someday,
how would you do it differently than 

2969
02:00:15,131 --> 02:00:16,450
what you do now?

2970
02:00:16,780 --> 02:00:17,613
Because to me the biggest crime isn't 
that we had the kind of system we have 

2971
02:00:19,931 --> 02:00:23,600
is that we're not training people on how
to utilize it.

2972
02:00:23,601 --> 02:00:23,831
And,
I mean,

2973
02:00:23,831 --> 02:00:26,860
we have all these opportunities there 
and it sounds like a cliche,

2974
02:00:27,190 --> 02:00:29,710
but we're doing it.
And as you go through it,

2975
02:00:29,711 --> 02:00:30,640
you say to yourself,
well,

2976
02:00:30,641 --> 02:00:32,560
why can't more people do this?
Well,

2977
02:00:32,740 --> 02:00:34,840
who told them they could?
And who said,

2978
02:00:34,960 --> 02:00:35,440
you know,
I mean,

2979
02:00:35,440 --> 02:00:36,273
this is a little bit of a handholding,
but I'm teaching this to my kids right 

2980
02:00:38,531 --> 02:00:39,580
now,
right?

2981
02:00:39,790 --> 02:00:40,780
I'm telling them,
listen,

2982
02:00:40,781 --> 02:00:43,330
don't go do the soul killing job,
uh,

2983
02:00:43,331 --> 02:00:46,240
work on this thing that you seem to be 
good at and that you love and let's work

2984
02:00:46,241 --> 02:00:47,470
on it.
Now what the,

2985
02:00:47,730 --> 02:00:49,240
I mean,
I guess what I'm saying is,

2986
02:00:49,241 --> 02:00:51,650
could we be doing a better job here?
Uh,

2987
02:00:51,670 --> 02:00:52,780
and if,
if so,

2988
02:00:53,030 --> 02:00:53,863
you know,
would you have to fight teachers unions 

2989
02:00:54,941 --> 02:00:55,500
to do it?

2990
02:00:55,500 --> 02:00:56,333
What do you have to do to break apart a 
system that's 140 years old and not 

2991
02:00:59,471 --> 02:01:00,304
working all that well right now?
Two more correspond to the reality that 

2992
02:01:03,401 --> 02:01:04,960
people are growing up in now.
Well,

2993
02:01:04,961 --> 02:01:07,330
I had a conversation with my daughter 
yesterday about this,

2994
02:01:07,331 --> 02:01:10,960
my nine year old and she to do it,
but she was saying,

2995
02:01:10,990 --> 02:01:13,540
she was saying,
school is so boring.

2996
02:01:13,750 --> 02:01:15,810
I don't want to go to school more.
And when she was laughing about,

2997
02:01:15,820 --> 02:01:19,420
I was picking her up from a class that 
she goes to and uh,

2998
02:01:19,421 --> 02:01:20,231
I said,
well,

2999
02:01:20,231 --> 02:01:21,370
what's the most boring?
She goes,

3000
02:01:21,371 --> 02:01:24,070
it's all boring to spend funny.
Right,

3001
02:01:24,071 --> 02:01:24,970
right.
And I go,

3002
02:01:24,971 --> 02:01:26,580
well,
you like reading and you're,

3003
02:01:26,581 --> 02:01:27,730
you're,
you're really into reading.

3004
02:01:27,731 --> 02:01:28,240
She goes,
yeah,

3005
02:01:28,240 --> 02:01:29,590
I do.
I like it.

3006
02:01:29,591 --> 02:01:31,810
But they make it boring.
She goes,

3007
02:01:31,811 --> 02:01:33,520
they make reading boring.
And she goes,

3008
02:01:33,521 --> 02:01:34,211
they make,
I go,

3009
02:01:34,211 --> 02:01:35,320
but you like writing,
right?

3010
02:01:35,350 --> 02:01:36,183
You're like writing shows.
I like writing what I want to write 

3011
02:01:38,171 --> 02:01:40,070
about.
They make writing bars,

3012
02:01:40,070 --> 02:01:42,590
she's creative,
but she was being silly.

3013
02:01:42,740 --> 02:01:43,573
But the wisdom from a nine year old,
we were just laughing and having fun 

3014
02:01:45,771 --> 02:01:46,604
talking about it.
But the wisdom from a nine year old 

3015
02:01:48,381 --> 02:01:52,640
expressing how they make things that she
likes boring.

3016
02:01:52,641 --> 02:01:53,474
It's like,
I think there's a certain amount that 

3017
02:01:55,641 --> 02:01:57,260
you have to do that's boring,
right?

3018
02:01:57,261 --> 02:01:58,670
There's a certain amount of the hard 
work,

3019
02:01:58,700 --> 02:02:01,400
even in your business that you're sure 
learning,

3020
02:02:01,401 --> 02:02:02,540
learning,
grammar,

3021
02:02:02,541 --> 02:02:04,550
learning language,
certain amount of that stuff,

3022
02:02:04,551 --> 02:02:05,384
it's fucking boring.
Once you get past that boring shit and 

3023
02:02:07,911 --> 02:02:11,150
you have a base understanding of how to 
communicate and how to add,

3024
02:02:11,151 --> 02:02:13,790
how to count,
how to multiply,

3025
02:02:13,791 --> 02:02:14,624
how government works,
all these different things that you 

3026
02:02:16,430 --> 02:02:18,230
should have sort of a base understanding
of.

3027
02:02:18,350 --> 02:02:21,140
Then it's like everyone has a different 
personality.

3028
02:02:21,141 --> 02:02:23,330
They have different,
different interests,

3029
02:02:23,331 --> 02:02:24,164
different different things that they 
would be really satisfied pursuing 

3030
02:02:27,290 --> 02:02:28,640
that's not encouraged.

3031
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,250
The what's encouraged encourages go find
a job.

3032
02:02:31,460 --> 02:02:36,160
What's encouraged is go find some place 
that you can shove yourself into.

3033
02:02:36,170 --> 02:02:37,003
Go find a square hole that you can stick
your round peg and just fucking jamming 

3034
02:02:41,331 --> 02:02:43,580
in there and shave down the top and the 
bottom.

3035
02:02:43,700 --> 02:02:44,533
So you slide in with all this extra 
space on the sides and feel like shit 

3036
02:02:47,600 --> 02:02:48,433
for the rest of your life because you 
need a job because you're in debt 

3037
02:02:51,500 --> 02:02:52,333
because you have credit cards because 
you have student loans because that's 

3038
02:02:55,131 --> 02:02:57,230
what everybody does and so you do it 
too.

3039
02:02:57,500 --> 02:02:58,333
That's what's wrong.
What's wrong is that we don't like we 

3040
02:03:01,221 --> 02:03:04,250
don't give,
it's like we met,

3041
02:03:04,280 --> 02:03:07,460
let them figure it out on their own and 
it fucking takes forever.

3042
02:03:07,670 --> 02:03:09,380
It takes,
it took forever for me.

3043
02:03:09,530 --> 02:03:10,363
My,
the only thing that I had going for me 

3044
02:03:11,361 --> 02:03:12,194
that was that I was crazy and that I had
been spending most of my high school 

3045
02:03:15,681 --> 02:03:16,514
years fighting so that I was already so 
far outside of anybody that I was so 

3046
02:03:21,231 --> 02:03:22,064
weird.

3047
02:03:22,160 --> 02:03:23,990
I didn't fit in anywhere.
It was weird too.

3048
02:03:23,991 --> 02:03:26,240
Isn't that funny?
I didn't feel like I had a pot.

3049
02:03:26,390 --> 02:03:30,050
I knew one thing.
I couldn't work like a regular job.

3050
02:03:30,051 --> 02:03:32,900
Like I had to figure out something else.
Cause I think there's the idea of,

3051
02:03:33,050 --> 02:03:36,500
it was literally the idea of being in an
office was like torture.

3052
02:03:36,710 --> 02:03:38,630
Can I just tell you,
so that's the hinge point.

3053
02:03:38,750 --> 02:03:40,430
The difference between you and this.
So,

3054
02:03:40,460 --> 02:03:41,293
so here's if I was,
if I was creating a fantasy educational 

3055
02:03:43,701 --> 02:03:44,534
system,
the hinge point between what you just 

3056
02:03:46,101 --> 02:03:48,680
said is that you said,
I couldn't stand this.

3057
02:03:48,681 --> 02:03:50,870
I couldn't work the real job.
I couldn't fit into this.

3058
02:03:51,020 --> 02:03:53,930
So I did something,
I had to find another way.

3059
02:03:54,560 --> 02:03:57,860
A lot of people get stuck with the,
so I had to find another way apart.

3060
02:03:57,920 --> 02:03:58,980
Yeah.
Um,

3061
02:03:59,160 --> 02:04:01,430
you know it's funny cause you know your 
kids are young enough to,

3062
02:04:01,431 --> 02:04:02,264
so you went through this,
but I mean when my kids were really 

3063
02:04:03,651 --> 02:04:04,484
young before they were in the school 
there and now we put them in one of 

3064
02:04:05,631 --> 02:04:06,860
those Montessori schools.

3065
02:04:06,860 --> 02:04:09,650
You know the ones that everybody goes 
together.

3066
02:04:09,940 --> 02:04:10,311
No,
it's,

3067
02:04:10,311 --> 02:04:12,110
it's,
it's different school to school.

3068
02:04:12,140 --> 02:04:12,973
But,
but the basic concept is that you don't 

3069
02:04:14,481 --> 02:04:16,970
force the children to learn anything 
specific.

3070
02:04:16,971 --> 02:04:20,780
You have all these things around and the
children go to work they want to do.

3071
02:04:21,250 --> 02:04:22,083
Um,
so the upsides obviously that from the 

3072
02:04:23,421 --> 02:04:25,490
get go they're only reading what they're
into.

3073
02:04:25,491 --> 02:04:26,324
Or the downside of course is that 
there's all this other stuff you're 

3074
02:04:27,951 --> 02:04:28,970
supposed to,
to learn.

3075
02:04:28,971 --> 02:04:29,804
It's the Diet.
It's the dichotomy between how do you 

3076
02:04:31,701 --> 02:04:31,951
know,
you,

3077
02:04:31,951 --> 02:04:33,650
you had talked about needing to have 
these skills,

3078
02:04:33,651 --> 02:04:35,870
a little math skills.
You need some basic foundational stuff,

3079
02:04:36,290 --> 02:04:38,070
but something also happening at

3080
02:04:38,070 --> 02:04:38,903
that level,
which is you're finding out which 

3081
02:04:40,051 --> 02:04:42,780
students are into math and would like to
have a career in math.

3082
02:04:43,020 --> 02:04:43,853
Other people are being touched by a 
foreign language in a way that they 

3083
02:04:45,601 --> 02:04:47,610
think I'd like to learn more than I'd 
like to speak in fluent.

3084
02:04:47,640 --> 02:04:49,050
I'd like to teach it.
So in a way,

3085
02:04:49,051 --> 02:04:49,884
you're already beginning to select what 
kids are into by exposing them to this 

3086
02:04:52,501 --> 02:04:54,420
stuff.
Most of us find it boring,

3087
02:04:54,600 --> 02:04:57,630
but there might be something.
That's where I first found history as a,

3088
02:04:57,660 --> 02:04:59,220
as a discipline,
right?

3089
02:04:59,380 --> 02:05:00,810
If,
if most kids is,

3090
02:05:00,860 --> 02:05:01,693
Oh God,
the last thing I want to hear some 

3091
02:05:02,131 --> 02:05:04,710
history,
but I get turned on by it.

3092
02:05:04,711 --> 02:05:05,544
Okay,
well we'll then it's worth exposing you 

3093
02:05:06,931 --> 02:05:08,370
to all those things.
Um,

3094
02:05:08,400 --> 02:05:11,040
I think the problem is though is that it
would be great,

3095
02:05:11,041 --> 02:05:13,740
for example,
to have half your schooling,

3096
02:05:13,741 --> 02:05:14,574
maybe at that young age,
be sort of a Montessori model where you 

3097
02:05:16,531 --> 02:05:17,160
say,
okay,

3098
02:05:17,160 --> 02:05:18,510
we spend our time on reading,
writing,

3099
02:05:18,511 --> 02:05:19,320
and arithmetic.

3100
02:05:19,320 --> 02:05:21,570
Now we want you to go around and it has 
to be,

3101
02:05:21,571 --> 02:05:22,404
you can't be playing video games and 
less playing video games is what you 

3102
02:05:24,241 --> 02:05:25,950
want to do for a living and you're going
to be able to,

3103
02:05:26,060 --> 02:05:28,260
to do some educational work on it.
But I mean,

3104
02:05:28,261 --> 02:05:31,170
I would love to see more of a fostering 
for the fact that,

3105
02:05:31,171 --> 02:05:32,004
listen,
we're trying to create entrepreneurs 

3106
02:05:33,481 --> 02:05:37,740
here rather than trying to create drone 
workers on the Amazon assembly line.

3107
02:05:37,920 --> 02:05:41,160
Now if you end up on the Amazon assembly
line anyway,

3108
02:05:41,161 --> 02:05:41,941
great.
Good for you.

3109
02:05:41,941 --> 02:05:42,774
I'm glad you can bring some food home.
But the goal ought to be to let you 

3110
02:05:46,051 --> 02:05:48,360
start a business and maybe employ a 
bunch of other people,

3111
02:05:48,361 --> 02:05:49,470
you know?
Yeah.

3112
02:05:49,471 --> 02:05:53,040
And the goal would be to have less 
unhappy,

3113
02:05:53,070 --> 02:05:56,340
dissatisfied p that because it creates a
more stable society.

3114
02:05:56,370 --> 02:05:57,690
Well,
it also happier.

3115
02:05:57,750 --> 02:06:00,150
Yeah.
It creates more,

3116
02:06:00,180 --> 02:06:03,570
more satisfaction in the people that I 
know that get to do what they want to do

3117
02:06:03,571 --> 02:06:04,790
for a living.
It's not like they're,

3118
02:06:05,160 --> 02:06:07,190
their lives are completely how 
everybody's going to,

3119
02:06:07,340 --> 02:06:09,990
that's what its problems.
No matter who you are,

3120
02:06:10,370 --> 02:06:11,203
you know what a,
it was a Kanye west who said to rich 

3121
02:06:12,991 --> 02:06:14,610
people have problems or just different 
problems.

3122
02:06:14,611 --> 02:06:17,250
I mean it's,
everybody's got these challenges,

3123
02:06:17,251 --> 02:06:18,084
but like you said,
there's not a lot more more stressful 

3124
02:06:19,981 --> 02:06:22,230
than having a ton of credit card debt 
wondering,

3125
02:06:22,231 --> 02:06:23,490
you know,
if you're going to lose your house,

3126
02:06:23,491 --> 02:06:25,440
wondering how you're going to pay for 
your kids' education.

3127
02:06:25,441 --> 02:06:27,840
I mean all those things are soul 
crushing.

3128
02:06:27,870 --> 02:06:29,730
Not only that,
because you're in debt,

3129
02:06:29,731 --> 02:06:30,564
you get nervous.
So it suppresses your ability to take 

3130
02:06:32,791 --> 02:06:34,320
risks,
take risks,

3131
02:06:34,580 --> 02:06:36,930
cause you're in your cycle.
You don't want to lose your Gig.

3132
02:06:36,930 --> 02:06:38,100
You don't want to,
you know,

3133
02:06:38,101 --> 02:06:40,440
it's like man,
then you're tired,

3134
02:06:40,830 --> 02:06:41,663
you're tired.
I mean the one thing is as you get 

3135
02:06:43,141 --> 02:06:43,974
older,
I mean it's funny because I'm getting 

3136
02:06:45,721 --> 02:06:48,630
older is one of those things that you 
can only understand when you get there.

3137
02:06:48,631 --> 02:06:50,910
So I all through your life,
you're going through these,

3138
02:06:50,911 --> 02:06:52,800
God isn't it?
Isn't this the interesting part of being

3139
02:06:52,801 --> 02:06:55,920
in your 30s or being in your foot?
So as I go into my 50s now,

3140
02:06:55,921 --> 02:06:59,880
I'm sitting here going,
energy is so under talked about,

3141
02:07:00,290 --> 02:07:01,950
you know,
the ability to,

3142
02:07:01,980 --> 02:07:03,960
like my buddy who wrote me and said,
you know,

3143
02:07:03,961 --> 02:07:06,270
I feel like I screwed up my life.
I didn't take enough chances.

3144
02:07:06,460 --> 02:07:09,180
I played it safe and now I'm so unhappy.
He says,

3145
02:07:09,181 --> 02:07:10,014
and I just can't motivate myself at 50 
years old any more energy wise to start 

3146
02:07:14,551 --> 02:07:17,250
over,
energy is underrepresented.

3147
02:07:17,250 --> 02:07:19,410
It's hard.
Guys got to fix his health.

3148
02:07:19,890 --> 02:07:21,570
I knew you were going to say that.
See what it is.

3149
02:07:21,571 --> 02:07:25,100
Your health is your engine.
It helped is literally the,

3150
02:07:25,120 --> 02:07:26,940
the chassis,
the tires,

3151
02:07:26,941 --> 02:07:30,420
the brakes,
the engine of your vehicle that you move

3152
02:07:30,421 --> 02:07:31,254
through this life with.
And too many people don't pay attention 

3153
02:07:33,481 --> 02:07:35,000
to it at the end of the lack of energy 
is,

3154
02:07:35,500 --> 02:07:37,420
and as you get older,
especially not just that,

3155
02:07:37,450 --> 02:07:40,300
it,
it changes your ability to do things.

3156
02:07:40,630 --> 02:07:43,630
If you don't have energy,
not only will you not have the energy to

3157
02:07:43,631 --> 02:07:44,920
pursue things,
but you won't,

3158
02:07:45,340 --> 02:07:47,440
you won't be able to do them the same 
way.

3159
02:07:47,470 --> 02:07:48,303
If you have energy and enthusiasm and 
say like you're healthy and you want to 

3160
02:07:51,221 --> 02:07:52,054
write a book,
you're going to have thoughts that will 

3161
02:07:54,281 --> 02:07:58,000
come into your mind that won't come into
your mind if you're exhausted.

3162
02:07:58,060 --> 02:08:00,790
Agreed.
That's fucking huge.

3163
02:08:01,090 --> 02:08:03,370
That's huge for anything you're trying 
to pursue.

3164
02:08:03,371 --> 02:08:05,140
Whether we're talking about furniture 
making,

3165
02:08:05,290 --> 02:08:06,940
what they're talking about,
being an author,

3166
02:08:07,090 --> 02:08:07,923
whatever it is.
Let's talk about ideas for a minute 

3167
02:08:09,371 --> 02:08:10,204
because I think that's another one.
When we talk about small businesses or 

3168
02:08:11,771 --> 02:08:13,930
starting as an entrepreneur,
you know,

3169
02:08:14,140 --> 02:08:14,973
I'm one of those people that is not sure
that we don't have a finite number of 

3170
02:08:17,891 --> 02:08:18,724
ideas to each of us and all of them are 
valuable enough even if they don't 

3171
02:08:22,751 --> 02:08:24,700
appear to be on the surface to write 
down.

3172
02:08:25,680 --> 02:08:26,580
Um,
you know,

3173
02:08:26,620 --> 02:08:27,281
I,
as a matter fact,

3174
02:08:27,281 --> 02:08:29,740
I keep,
I went to a business meeting a couple of

3175
02:08:29,740 --> 02:08:32,680
years ago with one of these TV guys I 
was just talking about and we go to this

3176
02:08:32,681 --> 02:08:35,110
business meeting and you know,
we're all on our phones and whatever and

3177
02:08:35,111 --> 02:08:35,944
he pulls out an old fashioned journal 
that you write in and he's just starts 

3178
02:08:39,581 --> 02:08:40,414
writing.

3179
02:08:40,900 --> 02:08:43,720
And I looked at that and I thought in 
one sense he looks like a dinosaur,

3180
02:08:43,721 --> 02:08:48,520
but I went out and bought one and now 
it's crazy how often,

3181
02:08:48,550 --> 02:08:49,383
you know,
all I do is write ideas in it and a lot 

3182
02:08:51,341 --> 02:08:52,930
of them I look back on now and I go,
okay,

3183
02:08:52,931 --> 02:08:55,300
that's still stupid.
But other ones I look back on and go,

3184
02:08:55,301 --> 02:08:56,134
God,
I didn't know what this idea meant at 

3185
02:08:57,521 --> 02:08:58,354
the time,
but five years later this idea is 

3186
02:08:59,591 --> 02:09:00,424
really,
you know,

3187
02:09:00,670 --> 02:09:01,503
I guess what I'm saying is,
is that if you wanted to take almost 

3188
02:09:03,011 --> 02:09:03,844
like a religious view of it,
God only gives you somebody that right 

3189
02:09:05,920 --> 02:09:09,730
down and cherish the ideas.
But there is something to that folks.

3190
02:09:10,150 --> 02:09:10,983
What really is going to make you unique 
sometimes is the way your brain works 

3191
02:09:13,901 --> 02:09:16,990
differently than anyone's brain who's 
ever existed on the planet.

3192
02:09:17,410 --> 02:09:20,860
That's valuable right there.
Write down what comes out of the brain.

3193
02:09:21,100 --> 02:09:21,933
Um,
because you capture those calves are 

3194
02:09:23,371 --> 02:09:26,830
don't tap to them.
They will slip around and sometimes,

3195
02:09:26,980 --> 02:09:31,210
sometimes the idea isn't good until you,
until the second half arrives later,

3196
02:09:31,340 --> 02:09:32,173
right?
So idea number ones in your book from 

3197
02:09:33,641 --> 02:09:34,474
five years ago.
Idea number two that finally completes 

3198
02:09:35,891 --> 02:09:37,120
that.
Id arrives later.

3199
02:09:37,420 --> 02:09:38,253
I mean,
I had a friend who was so creative and 

3200
02:09:39,041 --> 02:09:39,874
he said he gets the best ideas at night.
So he just turns on the light and the 

3201
02:09:42,670 --> 02:09:43,503
light at the side of the table writes it
down in the book and by morning there's 

3202
02:09:45,641 --> 02:09:49,780
another idea down there.
And quantity has a quality all its own.

3203
02:09:49,781 --> 02:09:54,781
And sometimes a book filled with 
interesting ideas out of your individual

3204
02:09:55,091 --> 02:09:58,420
unique head will help you later on.
So write them down.

3205
02:09:58,470 --> 02:09:58,870
Yeah.
Yeah.

3206
02:09:58,870 --> 02:09:59,770
There's no downside.

3207
02:09:59,860 --> 02:10:02,560
I have an APP on my phone where I can 
just,

3208
02:10:02,561 --> 02:10:03,820
uh,
you know the notes app?

3209
02:10:03,870 --> 02:10:06,250
Yes,
use that microphone filled.

3210
02:10:06,251 --> 02:10:07,930
Let's talk into that.
I do too.

3211
02:10:07,931 --> 02:10:10,510
And it dictates it really almost 
perfectly.

3212
02:10:10,660 --> 02:10:12,910
So I'll have an idea and I'll just be 
driving down the road.

3213
02:10:12,911 --> 02:10:15,100
I just press that button.
I started talking into it and then I put

3214
02:10:15,101 --> 02:10:16,180
it down.
I got it.

3215
02:10:16,240 --> 02:10:17,073
Like I got that one a captured it.
Think about people who've had one 

3216
02:10:19,421 --> 02:10:23,200
fantastic idea and their life and built 
their whole life on it.

3217
02:10:23,560 --> 02:10:25,360
And you never know which idea that's 
going to be.

3218
02:10:25,361 --> 02:10:25,921
And you know what,
I,

3219
02:10:25,921 --> 02:10:28,690
I was an Improv again.
You know more about this than I do,

3220
02:10:28,691 --> 02:10:31,500
but I was a theater major for my first 
two years of college and we,

3221
02:10:31,530 --> 02:10:35,990
we did improv comedy and the Guy who 
taught us Improv in high school really?

3222
02:10:36,160 --> 02:10:38,930
He had a great line.
He said that part of your brain,

3223
02:10:38,931 --> 02:10:40,640
like every part of your brain is a 
muscle.

3224
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:42,650
And he said,
the more you're thinking,

3225
02:10:42,651 --> 02:10:44,900
okay,
I got to show this Friday that I have to

3226
02:10:44,901 --> 02:10:46,910
come up with something funny for the 
better.

3227
02:10:46,911 --> 02:10:48,360
You get at it and,
and,

3228
02:10:48,480 --> 02:10:49,313
and you start looking,
your brain starts looking at things and 

3229
02:10:51,981 --> 02:10:52,814
finding thing.
So you're almost like training it to 

3230
02:10:54,651 --> 02:10:58,700
help you now in this new endeavor.
It's a very plastic sort of an approach.

3231
02:10:58,701 --> 02:11:00,410
But,
but it's the same thing with the ideas.

3232
02:11:00,710 --> 02:11:04,040
One idea in your little book that you 
wrote down could make your life,

3233
02:11:04,041 --> 02:11:06,050
your child.
I mean if you're a Henry Ford,

3234
02:11:06,290 --> 02:11:07,123
I mean,
how many people did you employ for 

3235
02:11:08,691 --> 02:11:11,270
decades afterwards because of a good 
idea.

3236
02:11:11,271 --> 02:11:13,070
I mean,
our world is built on those things.

3237
02:11:13,100 --> 02:11:18,100
And also like the idea of having these 
ideas and the enthusiasm that comes from

3238
02:11:18,411 --> 02:11:18,560
it.

3239
02:11:18,560 --> 02:11:22,100
Like it starts to escalate and you start
to calculate like,

3240
02:11:22,130 --> 02:11:23,750
oh,
and I need more.

3241
02:11:23,751 --> 02:11:25,420
And I think this and maybe that.
And,

3242
02:11:25,560 --> 02:11:28,310
and then the,
the motivation and the momentum of these

3243
02:11:28,311 --> 02:11:32,420
ideas can lead to enthusiasm.
You attract other people who have,

3244
02:11:32,421 --> 02:11:33,254
who can add,
I mean this is what we said about like 

3245
02:11:35,151 --> 02:11:38,030
you start your website and you just do 
it because things,

3246
02:11:38,031 --> 02:11:38,864
once you push the,
the verb of living manages to create 

3247
02:11:41,870 --> 02:11:45,830
ripples into get ultimate metaphysical 
ubit ripples in time in front of you.

3248
02:11:45,831 --> 02:11:48,620
That open up possibilities and because 
someone may,

3249
02:11:48,780 --> 02:11:52,580
if you only have one podcast listener 
but that podcast listeners like,

3250
02:11:52,581 --> 02:11:53,420
wow,
that's great.

3251
02:11:53,421 --> 02:11:54,254
I'm going to and gets a hold of you and 
your life goes off in another different 

3252
02:11:56,301 --> 02:11:58,040
direction.
But you have to try.

3253
02:11:58,370 --> 02:11:59,810
You have to try.
Yeah,

3254
02:11:59,811 --> 02:12:02,420
well you don't have to,
you could just drone on,

3255
02:12:02,870 --> 02:12:04,700
but no,
I would recommend not doing that.

3256
02:12:04,940 --> 02:12:08,510
I would also suggest that you and I and 
everyone has an interest in,

3257
02:12:08,511 --> 02:12:11,120
in not allowing people to drone on too 
much because,

3258
02:12:11,600 --> 02:12:13,480
because for the same reason I talked 
about Insta,

3259
02:12:13,540 --> 02:12:17,360
we did a common sense show once called 
the revenge of the gangrenous finger.

3260
02:12:17,720 --> 02:12:19,790
And the idea was that,
you know,

3261
02:12:19,791 --> 02:12:24,320
if you ignore people in your society 
that aren't doing well long enough,

3262
02:12:24,350 --> 02:12:27,050
it's a little like saying yes,
my finger has gang green,

3263
02:12:27,051 --> 02:12:28,940
but it's the little ones,
so who the hell cares?

3264
02:12:29,210 --> 02:12:31,430
But eventually if you ignore it long 
enough,

3265
02:12:31,431 --> 02:12:34,310
it will poison your bloodstream and 
destroy the body itself.

3266
02:12:34,730 --> 02:12:38,480
If you have enough people in soul 
crushing situations who can't,

3267
02:12:38,570 --> 02:12:40,460
you know,
a guy called me once on the radio when I

3268
02:12:40,461 --> 02:12:43,430
was preaching revolution in the middle 
of 1990s and said,

3269
02:12:43,790 --> 02:12:46,390
you're an idiot.
He said you're an idiot because no one's

3270
02:12:46,400 --> 02:12:47,270
going to face the bay.

3271
02:12:47,270 --> 02:12:48,103
Annette's as long as they have enough 
food in their bellies and they're doing 

3272
02:12:49,821 --> 02:12:50,870
halfway.
Okay.

3273
02:12:51,110 --> 02:12:54,530
But of course the implication there is 
if they don't have food in their bellies

3274
02:12:54,650 --> 02:12:57,740
and they're not doing okay,
then all bets are off.

3275
02:12:58,100 --> 02:12:58,933
We all have a vested interest in seeing 
that more of our country men do better 

3276
02:13:01,910 --> 02:13:02,743
because it's better for the society as a
whole creates a better world for your 

3277
02:13:04,671 --> 02:13:06,020
kids.
Happier.

3278
02:13:06,770 --> 02:13:07,790
I mean,
there's so many.

3279
02:13:07,791 --> 02:13:09,470
And the one thing about our system,
you know,

3280
02:13:09,471 --> 02:13:11,540
people talk about patriotism all the 
time.

3281
02:13:11,930 --> 02:13:13,700
Uh,
but to me the real patriotism is saying,

3282
02:13:13,701 --> 02:13:16,100
we've created a system here.
It works this way.

3283
02:13:16,160 --> 02:13:18,410
It encourages people to go do these 
things.

3284
02:13:18,770 --> 02:13:21,350
So if the system's designed and set up 
for that,

3285
02:13:21,380 --> 02:13:23,720
you ought to give it a try.
You ought to just see,

3286
02:13:24,150 --> 02:13:24,983
know the suggestion that I always give 
to people is write down things that you 

3287
02:13:28,221 --> 02:13:29,300
want to try to accomplish.

3288
02:13:29,420 --> 02:13:31,010
Just write them down.
Or a guy said to,

3289
02:13:31,080 --> 02:13:31,913
he said,
who said right the way you want your 

3290
02:13:33,121 --> 02:13:36,810
obituary to appear?
Now sit down,

3291
02:13:36,811 --> 02:13:38,370
write your obituary.
He says,

3292
02:13:38,371 --> 02:13:40,740
because that'll show you how far off 
your goals you are.

3293
02:13:41,120 --> 02:13:42,360
Here's a,
here's a better one.

3294
02:13:42,690 --> 02:13:43,523
Pretend there's a documentary crew 
filming your success story and they're 

3295
02:13:46,381 --> 02:13:48,300
following you around right now.
What would you do?

3296
02:13:48,620 --> 02:13:49,453
What would you do if you knew that there
was a crew following you around with 

3297
02:13:51,991 --> 02:13:55,140
cameras documenting your future?
Incredible success,

3298
02:13:55,530 --> 02:13:57,450
and they want to catch you in the act of
at all.

3299
02:13:57,510 --> 02:13:59,130
You would do all the right things.
You would have to do.

3300
02:13:59,131 --> 02:14:00,510
Think about that,
organize it.

3301
02:14:00,511 --> 02:14:01,344
But we're,
we are saddled down by so many doubts 

3302
02:14:03,870 --> 02:14:04,703
and so,
so much just mental horse shit that 

3303
02:14:07,831 --> 02:14:08,890
keeps people from,
uh,

3304
02:14:09,060 --> 02:14:10,950
from action.
But look at the thing,

3305
02:14:10,951 --> 02:14:11,784
that's,
to me maybe the number one thing that's 

3306
02:14:13,141 --> 02:14:15,270
the impediment and the make society 
unequal.

3307
02:14:15,300 --> 02:14:17,700
It's,
it's the luck of who your parents are.

3308
02:14:17,730 --> 02:14:18,780
That's a big one.
I mean,

3309
02:14:18,781 --> 02:14:19,380
if,
if,

3310
02:14:19,380 --> 02:14:20,370
if you say,
listen,

3311
02:14:20,520 --> 02:14:21,353
this guy grew up and started his own 
business because his folks taught in 

3312
02:14:23,341 --> 02:14:26,760
those kinds of things and encouraged him
when he is or she with her creativity.

3313
02:14:27,150 --> 02:14:27,983
Okay,
that's a person that's got a huge 

3314
02:14:28,711 --> 02:14:29,544
advantage in life.
We talked about white privilege giving 

3315
02:14:30,571 --> 02:14:31,290
you an advantage.
Well,

3316
02:14:31,290 --> 02:14:33,420
good parent privilege gives you an 
advantage.

3317
02:14:33,810 --> 02:14:34,643
But then the question that as if you're 
looking at it macro in a society since 

3318
02:14:37,051 --> 02:14:38,070
that comes up is okay,
what,

3319
02:14:38,220 --> 02:14:42,540
what can society do if you say this is a
real problem for the rest of us,

3320
02:14:42,541 --> 02:14:45,240
not enough good parents,
cause those people never learned it.

3321
02:14:45,510 --> 02:14:46,343
How do you compensate for that?
And that almost gets a little 

3322
02:14:47,911 --> 02:14:51,450
socialistic where you're talking about 
the state teaching you creativity and it

3323
02:14:51,451 --> 02:14:52,740
doesn't really make a whole lot of 
sense,

3324
02:14:52,741 --> 02:14:53,574
but there's got to be,
if we decide that this is a national 

3325
02:14:55,261 --> 02:14:56,970
security interest,
you know,

3326
02:14:56,971 --> 02:15:00,150
having more Americans live in the dream 
have less losers.

3327
02:15:00,780 --> 02:15:02,730
But what if your parents are losers?
Yeah,

3328
02:15:02,731 --> 02:15:03,564
well you can get past that.
I know a lot of people that are fucking 

3329
02:15:05,030 --> 02:15:07,040
losers for parents.
Could we increase the,

3330
02:15:07,070 --> 02:15:08,220
the,
the number of people,

3331
02:15:08,340 --> 02:15:08,821
you know,
if you say,

3332
02:15:08,821 --> 02:15:11,310
okay,
500 out of a thousand overcome that,

3333
02:15:11,490 --> 02:15:12,323
how do you get to 600 how do you get to 
700 out of a thousand and if you say 

3334
02:15:14,851 --> 02:15:17,100
it's a national security concern that we
do,

3335
02:15:17,430 --> 02:15:20,520
I mean I think ambition is a gene.
I really do.

3336
02:15:20,521 --> 02:15:24,390
And I think that that some of us,
you could be born into any circumstance,

3337
02:15:24,391 --> 02:15:25,224
but you've got this gene so you're going
to be ambitious and you're going to 

3338
02:15:26,761 --> 02:15:27,594
overcome it.
Then I think there's people who have no 

3339
02:15:28,891 --> 02:15:31,140
ambition gene and there's nothing you 
can do to help them.

3340
02:15:31,350 --> 02:15:32,183
And then I think there's a huge number 
of people in the middle that could go 

3341
02:15:34,141 --> 02:15:34,920
either way.

3342
02:15:34,920 --> 02:15:37,620
And the question I have is,
you don't have to help the ones with the

3343
02:15:37,621 --> 02:15:38,454
gene.
You can't do anything for the ones 

3344
02:15:39,511 --> 02:15:40,344
without the gene.
How do you increase the odds for the 

3345
02:15:41,821 --> 02:15:44,940
people who could go either way?
I think you give them a template.

3346
02:15:45,030 --> 02:15:48,870
You give them some,
some markers that they can follow.

3347
02:15:48,900 --> 02:15:49,890
Who's we though?
I mean,

3348
02:15:49,960 --> 02:15:51,450
they're little me.
Yes,

3349
02:15:51,451 --> 02:15:52,284
it's yes.
Okay.

3350
02:15:52,290 --> 02:15:55,020
Anybody who has maybe gone,
anybody who's ahead.

3351
02:15:55,030 --> 02:15:55,681
Here you go,
hey,

3352
02:15:55,681 --> 02:15:56,880
come on,
come this way.

3353
02:15:56,940 --> 02:15:57,773
I mean that's,
there's a responsibility that we have 

3354
02:15:59,071 --> 02:16:01,140
for each other.
What about last and Canadian businesses?

3355
02:16:01,141 --> 02:16:01,561
I mean,
you know,

3356
02:16:01,561 --> 02:16:02,760
you look at some of these,
um,

3357
02:16:02,850 --> 02:16:04,260
in the little town where it was a little
town,

3358
02:16:04,261 --> 02:16:04,951
Eugene,
Oregon,

3359
02:16:04,951 --> 02:16:07,260
where I live now,
they have a above Eugene,

3360
02:16:07,261 --> 02:16:08,010
by the way,
you know,

3361
02:16:08,010 --> 02:16:11,180
it's great if you're from Los Angeles,
green,

3362
02:16:11,210 --> 02:16:12,510
it's,
I liked boulder where you live.

3363
02:16:12,511 --> 02:16:13,640
I went to college there.
Um,

3364
02:16:13,890 --> 02:16:15,900
but if you are living in a place like 
that,

3365
02:16:15,901 --> 02:16:16,734
they have a venture capitalist angel 
investor thing for people who are 

3366
02:16:19,861 --> 02:16:22,350
starting small businesses and it's not a
government deal,

3367
02:16:22,351 --> 02:16:24,060
although the counties,
and I think of a little bit,

3368
02:16:24,061 --> 02:16:24,894
but,
but it's one of those things where you 

3369
02:16:25,261 --> 02:16:25,921
go,
okay,

3370
02:16:25,921 --> 02:16:28,890
if this is a good idea,
could we be doing more of this where you

3371
02:16:29,410 --> 02:16:30,070
joe blow

3372
02:16:30,070 --> 02:16:32,470
wants to start a business,
he needs $100,000

3373
02:16:32,471 --> 02:16:33,304
to do it.
Uh,

3374
02:16:33,430 --> 02:16:34,263
if you go to a bank,
they're never going to approve it 

3375
02:16:34,961 --> 02:16:36,220
because you have too much credit card 
debt.

3376
02:16:36,221 --> 02:16:37,720
Could we as a society say,
hey,

3377
02:16:37,721 --> 02:16:39,700
we have an interest in Joe blow doing 
well,

3378
02:16:39,701 --> 02:16:41,950
would that furniture company,
what can we do to help?

3379
02:16:42,550 --> 02:16:43,383
I think the pie in the sky,
the better thing would be the not have 

3380
02:16:45,701 --> 02:16:48,350
alone to try to figure out how to do 
without a alone.

3381
02:16:48,520 --> 02:16:49,353
I agree.
Beautiful things about kickstarter and 

3382
02:16:51,071 --> 02:16:52,540
go fund me.
Is it,

3383
02:16:52,870 --> 02:16:53,621
you know,
you can,

3384
02:16:53,621 --> 02:16:56,230
you could raise money now.
We don't need a storefront.

3385
02:16:56,260 --> 02:16:57,370
Oh,
you don't need anything.

3386
02:16:57,420 --> 02:16:58,121
Yeah.
You know,

3387
02:16:58,121 --> 02:17:02,200
I just,
I just feel like people need inspiration

3388
02:17:02,201 --> 02:17:03,034
and they need guidelines.
And if long as you could just start 

3389
02:17:06,341 --> 02:17:08,320
moving,
just get action.

3390
02:17:08,321 --> 02:17:10,360
Like you just getting,
just movement,

3391
02:17:10,570 --> 02:17:12,730
get such as a girl you got,
yeah.

3392
02:17:12,820 --> 02:17:14,830
And folks listen,
that's the one thing you really take out

3393
02:17:14,831 --> 02:17:17,830
of this is that just try and see what 
happens.

3394
02:17:17,831 --> 02:17:19,420
And my stepfather had a great line.
He said,

3395
02:17:19,421 --> 02:17:21,120
what's the worst that can happen?
Yeah.

3396
02:17:21,260 --> 02:17:22,093
And you know,
sometimes you have to think about that 

3397
02:17:22,991 --> 02:17:25,930
to realize if you're scared about 
failure,

3398
02:17:25,931 --> 02:17:28,360
don't be scared of it.
The greatest in the world have failed.

3399
02:17:28,600 --> 02:17:30,820
If you're worried about going into debt,
I understand that.

3400
02:17:30,940 --> 02:17:33,550
Don't be scared of failure.
I think failure is awesome for you.

3401
02:17:33,640 --> 02:17:35,290
And that's one of the reasons why,
like I said,

3402
02:17:35,291 --> 02:17:37,670
I like doing things that I suck at.
You know,

3403
02:17:37,680 --> 02:17:38,513
there's,
you could get real complacent if you're 

3404
02:17:39,791 --> 02:17:42,400
really good at something and you only do
that thing all the time.

3405
02:17:42,401 --> 02:17:43,990
Agree with that and you're not growing 
anymore.

3406
02:17:44,260 --> 02:17:46,210
You're just not challenged.
You're not like,

3407
02:17:46,211 --> 02:17:47,860
you're not at the bottom of the heap.

3408
02:17:48,190 --> 02:17:49,023
You know,
if you start Jujitsu right now and 

3409
02:17:49,901 --> 02:17:50,890
you're a white belt,
you're like,

3410
02:17:50,891 --> 02:17:52,420
Oh God,
what the fuck?

3411
02:17:52,421 --> 02:17:53,860
How,
how can I ever get good at this?

3412
02:17:54,130 --> 02:17:55,420
And it's,
it's humbling.

3413
02:17:55,540 --> 02:17:59,620
But in that humbling thing,
you learn about yourself,

3414
02:17:59,621 --> 02:18:02,470
you learn about discipline and you build
up that engine,

3415
02:18:02,471 --> 02:18:07,360
that muscle that is trying to work 
things out and figure things out,

3416
02:18:07,361 --> 02:18:09,430
creating a more formidable you.
Yeah.

3417
02:18:09,490 --> 02:18:12,130
It's a good way to look at it.
Now as a historian,

3418
02:18:12,400 --> 02:18:14,580
you know,
and [inaudible] like to say that you are

3419
02:18:14,590 --> 02:18:15,423
motherfucker,
I would didn't teach teacher you 

3420
02:18:18,041 --> 02:18:20,620
probably one of the most important 
historians ever.

3421
02:18:20,621 --> 02:18:21,700
How about that fuck face.

3422
02:18:23,960 --> 02:18:25,630
Don't know what,
I'm speechless.

3423
02:18:26,770 --> 02:18:29,620
But as someone who is a fan of history,
how about this,

3424
02:18:29,621 --> 02:18:31,240
I'll tell you got it more palatable for 
you.

3425
02:18:31,590 --> 02:18:33,790
Um,
how do you look at,

3426
02:18:33,791 --> 02:18:34,624
what do you do you look at like what's 
going on with this administration and 

3427
02:18:37,991 --> 02:18:39,820
with this country and this the,
I mean,

3428
02:18:39,821 --> 02:18:44,200
our president is he,
he tweeted at the,

3429
02:18:44,410 --> 02:18:48,700
at Kim Jong [inaudible] saying that Kim 
Jong owns said that I'm old.

3430
02:18:48,701 --> 02:18:49,534
I don't know why he said that because I 
never say that he's short and fat and 

3431
02:18:51,881 --> 02:18:53,770
like maybe we can be friends.
I'm just like,

3432
02:18:53,771 --> 02:18:56,800
he's like Don rickles as president.
Fucking hilarious.

3433
02:18:56,801 --> 02:18:57,634
But do you look at it in terms of like 
one day someone is going to do a 

3434
02:19:02,261 --> 02:19:06,850
hardcore history series about the trump 
administration?

3435
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:09,940
Do you ever look at it that way?
Do you look at it in terms of like,

3436
02:19:10,330 --> 02:19:11,163
like establishing a narrative or like 
trying to describe it to the two people 

3437
02:19:16,860 --> 02:19:19,810
some day?
I think we're too in the Maelstrom,

3438
02:19:19,830 --> 02:19:21,520
like we said earlier,
for me to figure that out,

3439
02:19:21,521 --> 02:19:25,000
I will say that I see a certain side 
benefits.

3440
02:19:25,001 --> 02:19:26,320
So for example,
you know,

3441
02:19:26,321 --> 02:19:28,010
one of the things that I've talked about
for many,

3442
02:19:28,010 --> 02:19:28,843
many years,
and we did a whole six hour podcast on 

3443
02:19:30,411 --> 02:19:31,041
it too,
is the,

3444
02:19:31,041 --> 02:19:35,270
is the president's power to launch a 
nuclear war all by himself or herself?

3445
02:19:36,190 --> 02:19:36,770
Well,
and it's,

3446
02:19:36,770 --> 02:19:37,910
here's the thing is that,
that,

3447
02:19:37,930 --> 02:19:40,670
that's an obvious flaw.
I mean that's,

3448
02:19:40,840 --> 02:19:43,790
and everybody understands it,
but nobody's done anything about it.

3449
02:19:44,120 --> 02:19:46,430
So now because everyone's so scared of 
trump,

3450
02:19:46,520 --> 02:19:48,950
they're talking about fixing a problem 
that has,

3451
02:19:48,951 --> 02:19:50,930
should have been fixed decades and 
decades ago.

3452
02:19:51,170 --> 02:19:53,780
Not because he's a great president and 
they're looking for,

3453
02:19:53,870 --> 02:19:56,810
but because they're so fricking scared 
of him and he's so outside.

3454
02:19:56,960 --> 02:19:57,531
You know?
I mean,

3455
02:19:57,531 --> 02:19:58,364
it's funny because why these politicians
and they'll trust people from the other 

3456
02:20:02,181 --> 02:20:02,931
parties.
It doesn't matter.

3457
02:20:02,931 --> 02:20:05,150
You didn't hear the Democrats saying,
we can't have George W.

3458
02:20:05,150 --> 02:20:06,470
Bush with his finger on the nuclear 
button.

3459
02:20:06,680 --> 02:20:07,830
You didn't hear George W.
Bush.

3460
02:20:08,070 --> 02:20:10,700
They were all fine with it.
As long as you're one of those insiders,

3461
02:20:10,701 --> 02:20:13,220
the first time you get an outsider in 
there,

3462
02:20:13,490 --> 02:20:15,290
now they're scared to death.

3463
02:20:15,290 --> 02:20:17,810
But they should have been scared to 
death decades and decades ago.

3464
02:20:18,020 --> 02:20:18,853
So if you said that we have a trump 
presidency and the only big thing that 

3465
02:20:21,411 --> 02:20:22,244
comes out of it,
as they finally fixed that one person 

3466
02:20:23,961 --> 02:20:26,750
can't launch a nuclear war holocaust by 
themselves,

3467
02:20:27,590 --> 02:20:29,450
that's a pretty big deal,
right?

3468
02:20:29,451 --> 02:20:30,284
The almost had to break a little aspect 
of the system for people to freak out 

3469
02:20:32,781 --> 02:20:34,550
enough to fix it.
But when you think,

3470
02:20:34,580 --> 02:20:36,140
look,
worst case scenarios,

3471
02:20:36,170 --> 02:20:37,003
you think worst case,
look at World War One is a worst case 

3472
02:20:38,361 --> 02:20:39,600
scenario.
Um,

3473
02:20:39,710 --> 02:20:44,710
if you have a person with the power to 
launch a nuclear war by themselves,

3474
02:20:47,090 --> 02:20:49,370
if anybody can't see that,
that's an untenable,

3475
02:20:49,371 --> 02:20:51,560
horrible situation and you look at human
history and go,

3476
02:20:51,561 --> 02:20:52,910
okay,
it's a ticking time bomb.

3477
02:20:52,940 --> 02:20:54,240
Literally.
Um,

3478
02:20:54,320 --> 02:20:56,360
then you're not,
you don't own very much history.

3479
02:20:56,510 --> 02:20:57,343
And the fact that we've escaped decades 
and decades without anybody fixing this 

3480
02:20:59,901 --> 02:21:00,770
problem.
Crazy.

3481
02:21:00,830 --> 02:21:01,663
Well,
so if the trump presidency alone caused 

3482
02:21:03,471 --> 02:21:06,710
us to fix that problem,
you'd have to say that for no,

3483
02:21:06,711 --> 02:21:09,470
I mean this wasn't trump's side,
he didn't want to fix that problem.

3484
02:21:09,680 --> 02:21:12,590
But as a byproduct of him getting into 
office,

3485
02:21:12,591 --> 02:21:13,424
if we could fix that problem,
depending on how history went in the 

3486
02:21:15,861 --> 02:21:17,750
future,
you could be saving 100 million lives.

3487
02:21:17,820 --> 02:21:19,500
Yeah.
If you could fix that problem.

3488
02:21:19,501 --> 02:21:20,334
But what if we get through the trump 
administration and we move ourselves 

3489
02:21:22,711 --> 02:21:23,544
into 2020 and someone really accepted 
into the car dash in administration 

3490
02:21:27,280 --> 02:21:30,000
after that?
Kanye will you do think,

3491
02:21:30,001 --> 02:21:31,350
I mean if,
if a q rating,

3492
02:21:31,351 --> 02:21:34,620
the q rating is a is is the,
is how well your name is known,

3493
02:21:34,621 --> 02:21:35,790
right?
So if,

3494
02:21:35,880 --> 02:21:36,713
if what trump proved is that you do not 
need a ton of money if you walk in the 

3495
02:21:40,441 --> 02:21:43,620
door with a q rating because that's what
the other politicians wanted for.

3496
02:21:43,621 --> 02:21:44,454
Right?
Well he's uniquely good at ignoring his 

3497
02:21:47,161 --> 02:21:50,730
fault and projecting his strengths and 
being confident.

3498
02:21:51,030 --> 02:21:53,310
All those things.
I mean he might be a sociopath,

3499
02:21:53,640 --> 02:21:58,640
but all those things that allow him to 
do that and completely ignore his faults

3500
02:21:58,920 --> 02:22:03,540
and keep constantly droning on about his
successes and how good he is.

3501
02:22:03,541 --> 02:22:06,660
It things that resonates with people in 
a very weird way.

3502
02:22:06,760 --> 02:22:11,670
We respect and admire the strong man and
people give into him.

3503
02:22:11,671 --> 02:22:13,980
There's a lot of halfass bay.
The hate that,

3504
02:22:13,981 --> 02:22:16,680
that to me that's so anti-american 
though is strong man.

3505
02:22:16,710 --> 02:22:19,350
But it is what happened.
That is what happened.

3506
02:22:19,351 --> 02:22:21,810
That's why I find it distasteful.
But I will say this,

3507
02:22:21,840 --> 02:22:22,673
uh,
there are certain things that he did 

3508
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,130
that are part of his,
that

3509
02:22:26,160 --> 02:22:26,993
that worked really well because it,
there are so many Americans so upset 

3510
02:22:29,881 --> 02:22:32,600
with the system.
I mean I remember one line from trumpet,

3511
02:22:32,610 --> 02:22:35,520
one of these debates that I thought was 
one of the great lines of all time.

3512
02:22:35,820 --> 02:22:39,810
And when he turned to rand Paul after 
Rand Paul slammed him and said,

3513
02:22:39,811 --> 02:22:41,520
you're not having a very good night,
are you?

3514
02:22:41,820 --> 02:22:43,530
And I remember thinking,
okay,

3515
02:22:43,531 --> 02:22:44,364
they're not a lot of Americans who just 
love anybody sticking it to these 

3516
02:22:48,181 --> 02:22:49,014
politicians.
Now because everybody is so upset with 

3517
02:22:50,251 --> 02:22:51,084
all the pollen.
So here's a guy who's sticking it to 

3518
02:22:52,171 --> 02:22:52,980
them.
But there's a,

3519
02:22:52,980 --> 02:22:56,130
there's a cutting off your nose to spite
your face side of this.

3520
02:22:56,131 --> 02:22:59,400
Cause I've always wanted an outsider,
but not this outsider.

3521
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:01,860
So you say to yourself,
okay,

3522
02:23:01,890 --> 02:23:04,800
we could have had a normal human being.
Cause look,

3523
02:23:04,980 --> 02:23:07,290
if you want to say what trump has,
I don't know the guy,

3524
02:23:07,291 --> 02:23:09,480
so I can't diagram when he,
but he's,

3525
02:23:09,540 --> 02:23:11,580
he's an extreme narcissist.

3526
02:23:11,840 --> 02:23:12,673
Now,
all these people have narcissistic 

3527
02:23:14,401 --> 02:23:17,310
complexes or you don't think I'm a good 
enough guy to be president.

3528
02:23:17,311 --> 02:23:18,240
Right.
Right there.

3529
02:23:18,241 --> 02:23:21,120
It's almost like you don't get through 
the door without too much narcissism.

3530
02:23:21,300 --> 02:23:22,920
I've never seen this much from,
uh,

3531
02:23:22,950 --> 02:23:24,090
from anybody.
I mean this is,

3532
02:23:24,300 --> 02:23:26,130
this is,
but um,

3533
02:23:26,430 --> 02:23:27,263
you know,
if if for a while that was working for 

3534
02:23:29,281 --> 02:23:33,510
him because he was so outside the norms,
there are certain like unspoken rules of

3535
02:23:33,511 --> 02:23:34,344
things you do and behave and he violated
all those and it was refreshing to have 

3536
02:23:37,381 --> 02:23:39,010
him violate them.
Um,

3537
02:23:39,900 --> 02:23:40,733
now we have,
I,

3538
02:23:41,310 --> 02:23:42,143
well when he told Hillary Clinton 
because you'd be in jail and everybody 

3539
02:23:44,281 --> 02:23:45,270
went nuts.
It's like,

3540
02:23:45,271 --> 02:23:47,640
yes,
because a lot of people cause people and

3541
02:23:47,641 --> 02:23:48,660
people and people,
you know,

3542
02:23:48,690 --> 02:23:50,340
the real thing I think a lot of people 
said,

3543
02:23:50,341 --> 02:23:51,840
which is tragic,
but I understand it,

3544
02:23:51,841 --> 02:23:52,674
is if we have to live with one of these 
people for four years and listened to 

3545
02:23:55,351 --> 02:23:56,184
them talk,
I'd rather have somebody who's making 

3546
02:23:57,211 --> 02:23:59,010
funny jokes that make me laugh rather 
than,

3547
02:23:59,250 --> 02:24:00,930
you know,
somebody who's obviously reading another

3548
02:24:00,931 --> 02:24:02,250
prepared speech that they didn't.

3549
02:24:02,260 --> 02:24:03,093
Exactly.
Or Sony where you really don't get a 

3550
02:24:04,951 --> 02:24:05,784
sense of who they really are.
Like a Hillary Clinton who is a career 

3551
02:24:07,981 --> 02:24:09,330
politician,
he's a chameleon.

3552
02:24:09,390 --> 02:24:13,500
She's just saying what she thinks the 
Poles are going to favor.

3553
02:24:13,770 --> 02:24:15,380
So then if,
um,

3554
02:24:16,530 --> 02:24:18,450
if you know the part that drives me the 
craziest,

3555
02:24:18,490 --> 02:24:19,323
it is 321 million people you said and 
the two people that we're voting on at 

3556
02:24:22,801 --> 02:24:25,830
the end of this thing or Hillary Clinton
and Donald Trump's hilarious.

3557
02:24:25,860 --> 02:24:26,693
That's the problem.
Well nobody wants that fucking 

3558
02:24:28,591 --> 02:24:31,140
magnifying glass turned on their life.
My stepdad said,

3559
02:24:31,141 --> 02:24:34,210
if you,
if you are really August person and,

3560
02:24:34,320 --> 02:24:35,153
and you're going to sit there and say 
the word to just means you're really 

3561
02:24:37,350 --> 02:24:39,510
powerful,
formidable human being.

3562
02:24:39,690 --> 02:24:40,800
How do you spell it?
Like August.

3563
02:24:40,801 --> 02:24:41,550
August.
Yeah.

3564
02:24:41,550 --> 02:24:42,920
And so,
so you sit down and if you're,

3565
02:24:43,110 --> 02:24:43,943
he said they,
those kinds of people divide a piece of 

3566
02:24:45,451 --> 02:24:46,284
paper in half and they write pros on one
side and cons on the other and they 

3567
02:24:49,651 --> 02:24:51,950
running for president and they go down 
the pros and the cons and go,

3568
02:24:52,230 --> 02:24:53,210
he goes to cons.

3569
02:24:53,300 --> 02:24:57,130
Outnumbered the pros five to one.
It might be 100 million.

3570
02:24:57,190 --> 02:24:59,160
I'm not going to have as much power as I
have now.

3571
02:24:59,220 --> 02:24:59,641
I Blah,
blah,

3572
02:24:59,641 --> 02:24:59,921
blah,
blah,

3573
02:24:59,921 --> 02:25:00,930
blah.
Everyone's going to hate you.

3574
02:25:00,931 --> 02:25:01,900
And he's,
he's so,

3575
02:25:01,920 --> 02:25:04,950
so people who are really intelligent,
if they do that calculation,

3576
02:25:04,951 --> 02:25:06,570
the calculation says,
don't run for president.

3577
02:25:06,571 --> 02:25:07,980
You'd be an idiot.
Now he says,

3578
02:25:07,981 --> 02:25:08,814
people though who run anyway,
it's because something on the pro side 

3579
02:25:12,181 --> 02:25:16,800
outweighs everything on the con side,
like I want to be on tv all the time,

3580
02:25:16,920 --> 02:25:18,660
or I want to be the most powerful person
in the world,

3581
02:25:18,690 --> 02:25:20,460
or it's the natural extension.
I've been a senator,

3582
02:25:20,461 --> 02:25:21,360
you know,
whatever it is.

3583
02:25:21,361 --> 02:25:24,250
In other words,
there's some ego question that's out

3584
02:25:24,280 --> 02:25:26,920
that that's drowning all the columns 
and,

3585
02:25:27,100 --> 02:25:27,933
and he said,
that's why you have to be careful 

3586
02:25:29,051 --> 02:25:29,884
because that's so,
so either have somebody who's not 

3587
02:25:31,121 --> 02:25:31,954
intelligent enough to,
to weigh the pros and cons or somebody 

3588
02:25:33,371 --> 02:25:34,204
who's so smart that the cons outweigh 
the pros and they choose to do it 

3589
02:25:37,070 --> 02:25:39,310
anyway.
What a crazy system.

3590
02:25:39,311 --> 02:25:40,144
When you think that that is the way we 
develop a person who is going to be in 

3591
02:25:43,811 --> 02:25:44,644
control of nuclear weapons.
We have a popularity contest where to 

3592
02:25:48,191 --> 02:25:50,800
when the popularity contest,
which is totally,

3593
02:25:51,220 --> 02:25:52,630
you know,
a elective,

3594
02:25:52,631 --> 02:25:54,470
you don't have to join,
but to,

3595
02:25:54,480 --> 02:25:58,230
to get into this contest and to win,
you're gonna,

3596
02:25:58,270 --> 02:26:00,310
you're gonna,
you're life's going to be torn apart.

3597
02:26:00,340 --> 02:26:01,173
They're going to go over there.
People are going to lie about you and 

3598
02:26:03,340 --> 02:26:05,160
look at your favorite person and say,
say,

3599
02:26:05,161 --> 02:26:05,994
you know,
you go look at some of these candidates 

3600
02:26:06,551 --> 02:26:08,010
from the past that we'd like to lionize.

3601
02:26:08,080 --> 02:26:09,820
Would they have even made it through the
process today?

3602
02:26:09,821 --> 02:26:12,610
Imagine what Kennedy would have had to 
jog and then it with John Kennedy,

3603
02:26:13,120 --> 02:26:13,953
the kind of things that would,
he'd have all these women coming 

3604
02:26:15,401 --> 02:26:16,960
forward.
Can you imagine it?

3605
02:26:16,961 --> 02:26:19,600
Who had never made it?
The doctor feelgood's would show up.

3606
02:26:20,120 --> 02:26:20,741
Oh my God.
Yeah.

3607
02:26:20,741 --> 02:26:23,170
They used to give him like amphetamines.
Right?

3608
02:26:23,530 --> 02:26:26,580
You had like some serious disease.
Addison's disease.

3609
02:26:27,490 --> 02:26:30,970
Glandula a problem with the glands where
it's not providing adrenaline.

3610
02:26:30,971 --> 02:26:32,320
I think,
don't quote me on that.

3611
02:26:32,350 --> 02:26:33,183
Wow.
So they had him on some sort of 

3612
02:26:34,091 --> 02:26:35,330
amphetamines.
So he,

3613
02:26:35,350 --> 02:26:36,183
he,
he was apparently on a lot of 

3614
02:26:36,851 --> 02:26:37,684
medication.
I think he had the last rights given to 

3615
02:26:38,951 --> 02:26:41,320
him once before because he came so close
to dying.

3616
02:26:42,040 --> 02:26:42,873
Well,
and truthfully I read that it impacted 

3617
02:26:45,251 --> 02:26:48,820
the way he kind of saw his life cause he
didn't expect it to be a long life.

3618
02:26:49,090 --> 02:26:50,860
And so it impacted on how,
but if you,

3619
02:26:50,880 --> 02:26:52,000
if somebody told you,
Joe,

3620
02:26:52,001 --> 02:26:52,834
you're not going to have,
well you're not going to have a long 

3621
02:26:53,861 --> 02:26:54,694
life.
How much does that change the way you 

3622
02:26:56,111 --> 02:26:58,450
live the rest of your life?
You probably live crazy.

3623
02:26:58,451 --> 02:26:59,284
You probably go navy skiing every day.
He'd skydiving or maybe you try to try 

3624
02:27:02,411 --> 02:27:06,670
to get the things on your bucket list in
terms of accomplishments done quick more

3625
02:27:06,671 --> 02:27:07,850
quickly or,
um,

3626
02:27:08,290 --> 02:27:09,123
but,
but you look at someone like that and 

3627
02:27:09,641 --> 02:27:10,930
said,
could a guy like that it made it through

3628
02:27:10,931 --> 02:27:12,640
the process?
Could Lyndon Johnson and made it through

3629
02:27:12,641 --> 02:27:13,870
the process get richer?
I mean,

3630
02:27:13,871 --> 02:27:14,704
all those people lived at a time period.
That was a lot less of a fishbowl than 

3631
02:27:17,891 --> 02:27:18,724
today.
And if you say that these great leaders 

3632
02:27:19,871 --> 02:27:22,330
can't make it through the process,
and the only people that make it through

3633
02:27:22,331 --> 02:27:24,160
the process are the ones who've been so 
careful,

3634
02:27:24,640 --> 02:27:27,350
never taken a risk,
lied like crazy co.

3635
02:27:27,370 --> 02:27:28,203
I mean,
if you say those are the only people 

3636
02:27:29,141 --> 02:27:29,974
that can make it through the process,
then maybe that explains why we 321 

3637
02:27:32,290 --> 02:27:35,020
million people,
this is the choice we end up with at the

3638
02:27:35,020 --> 02:27:35,351
end of the day.
Well,

3639
02:27:35,351 --> 02:27:36,184
we also have this problem where we look 
at someone's entire life and we look at 

3640
02:27:40,421 --> 02:27:41,254
all the different things that they do 
and we decide whether or not we accept 

3641
02:27:44,561 --> 02:27:45,394
certain things.
Like we're not talking about whether or 

3642
02:27:46,961 --> 02:27:49,380
not someone's honest with business,
whether you,

3643
02:27:49,420 --> 02:27:51,400
we want you to be honest with 
everything.

3644
02:27:51,430 --> 02:27:52,080
Yeah.
You gotta be,

3645
02:27:52,080 --> 02:27:54,770
you gotta get c average and everything.
You can't have an a in here.

3646
02:27:54,790 --> 02:27:57,280
And it wouldn't be the truly great 
people as we know,

3647
02:27:57,290 --> 02:27:59,470
often very flawed,
very flawed.

3648
02:27:59,471 --> 02:28:03,880
And also like what percentage of people 
who want to be leaders.

3649
02:28:03,881 --> 02:28:05,290
I think about that thing,
right?

3650
02:28:05,470 --> 02:28:08,530
You want to be the one on the podium 
telling everybody what's up.

3651
02:28:09,160 --> 02:28:11,410
What percentage of those guys want to 
fuck other women?

3652
02:28:11,560 --> 02:28:14,550
Is it a hundred right?
I mean,

3653
02:28:14,710 --> 02:28:17,290
I can't answer that,
but if you think about like nature,

3654
02:28:17,380 --> 02:28:21,860
like the natural leader types,
like throughout human history,

3655
02:28:22,040 --> 02:28:24,530
what percentage of those have been 
monogamous?

3656
02:28:24,800 --> 02:28:29,630
Those ones who want to control the army,
the ones who want to run the thing.

3657
02:28:29,750 --> 02:28:34,370
The ones who want to be at the top,
getting everybody to do their bidding.

3658
02:28:34,490 --> 02:28:35,323
The ones who want to have all the money 
and all the power and live in the 

3659
02:28:37,671 --> 02:28:41,600
castle.
Those guys are almost all adulterers,

3660
02:28:41,940 --> 02:28:42,950
you know?
It does.

3661
02:28:42,980 --> 02:28:43,813
It does argue for the idea that it might
be better to appoint somebody who 

3662
02:28:48,021 --> 02:28:50,150
doesn't want the job.
It's like somebody had talked to him,

3663
02:28:50,151 --> 02:28:51,770
he wants to talk about that with police 
officers.

3664
02:28:51,771 --> 02:28:52,940
And they had said,
listen,

3665
02:28:53,300 --> 02:28:54,133
there are all kinds of police officers,
but if you're the one who wants the job 

3666
02:28:57,530 --> 02:28:58,363
because you're going to chase bad guys 
and you want that adrenaline rush and 

3667
02:29:00,891 --> 02:29:01,724
the whole thing,
you're not the guy who should get the 

3668
02:29:02,151 --> 02:29:04,340
job or if the guy wants respect.

3669
02:29:04,340 --> 02:29:05,150
Yes.
But well like,

3670
02:29:05,150 --> 02:29:08,210
and you can see the funny thing is is,
and somebody sent this to me a long time

3671
02:29:08,211 --> 02:29:08,890
ago,
they showed a,

3672
02:29:08,890 --> 02:29:10,880
there's all these different um,
like um,

3673
02:29:10,940 --> 02:29:13,670
recruitment videos that the different 
police agencies have.

3674
02:29:13,671 --> 02:29:15,530
Right.
And some of them are more like,

3675
02:29:15,650 --> 02:29:18,110
you can get cats out of trees,
you can help old ladies.

3676
02:29:18,260 --> 02:29:19,740
And some of them are like,
you can try traffic,

3677
02:29:19,741 --> 02:29:20,574
great car.
And,

3678
02:29:20,580 --> 02:29:21,940
and,
and the funny thing is,

3679
02:29:22,010 --> 02:29:26,450
I would imagine that that influences the
sort of people that answer your ad.

3680
02:29:26,480 --> 02:29:27,160
Oh,
for sure.

3681
02:29:27,160 --> 02:29:27,993
I mean,
they have billboards in La for to try 

3682
02:29:30,141 --> 02:29:32,990
where they used to at least to try to 
hire new cops.

3683
02:29:33,110 --> 02:29:34,910
And they did it based on the money.
Like,

3684
02:29:34,911 --> 02:29:35,744
this is how much money you can get.
La PD is paying this mount and they'd 

3685
02:29:38,781 --> 02:29:40,220
show and you're like,
drive by like,

3686
02:29:40,250 --> 02:29:41,510
oh,
I can make that amount.

3687
02:29:41,700 --> 02:29:43,160
Okay,
I should try to do that.

3688
02:29:43,200 --> 02:29:45,830
John.
If you appointed cops see a billboard,

3689
02:29:45,831 --> 02:29:48,680
what I'm saying?
It's like when you're advertising,

3690
02:29:48,681 --> 02:29:51,590
it's the same problem you have when 
you're advertising for drug companies.

3691
02:29:51,860 --> 02:29:53,540
You get people thinking like,
oh,

3692
02:29:53,541 --> 02:29:55,460
maybe I need that abilify,
my life.

3693
02:29:55,610 --> 02:29:57,160
Oh humira.
Woo.

3694
02:29:57,170 --> 02:29:59,750
I need that.
That that seems like I liked the music,

3695
02:29:59,751 --> 02:30:01,850
their plan.
I like everybody's dancing.

3696
02:30:01,970 --> 02:30:03,710
Oh,
I like how that cop looks up there.

3697
02:30:03,711 --> 02:30:05,210
He looks,
he looks for medieval.

3698
02:30:05,300 --> 02:30:06,860
He looks like Amanda gets respect.
Look,

3699
02:30:06,861 --> 02:30:07,694
he's got his hands on his hips and he's 
got a nice car behind him and look as a 

3700
02:30:10,551 --> 02:30:13,760
female co squad leader with him.
I wonder if he fucks her.

3701
02:30:13,940 --> 02:30:14,773
You know,
like people start to look at an ad and 

3702
02:30:16,521 --> 02:30:20,120
you start imagining yourself in the 
position of that person,

3703
02:30:20,121 --> 02:30:22,150
in that Ad.
And then next thing you know,

3704
02:30:22,151 --> 02:30:22,984
you know you're the one who was going to
go get the bad guys and you're the one 

3705
02:30:25,011 --> 02:30:25,844
who's going to go.

3706
02:30:25,940 --> 02:30:28,100
But yeah,
if you talk to a real cop,

3707
02:30:28,101 --> 02:30:31,280
like a good cop is someone who respects 
community,

3708
02:30:31,281 --> 02:30:32,114
someone who wants to help someone who 
wants to establish some sort of a bond 

3709
02:30:35,661 --> 02:30:37,240
with the people that are in the 
community.

3710
02:30:37,241 --> 02:30:38,074
The patrols th like that's why they're 
trying to do in some neighborhoods are 

3711
02:30:40,881 --> 02:30:41,714
trying to have more people on foot and 
actually walk through the streets and 

3712
02:30:44,930 --> 02:30:47,030
become a part of the community.
Like don't,

3713
02:30:47,210 --> 02:30:49,340
you're not an outsider that's patrolling
it.

3714
02:30:49,341 --> 02:30:50,930
You're actually one of the people that's
there.

3715
02:30:51,260 --> 02:30:53,990
It goes to what we were saying about the
politicians that are tied it all in.

3716
02:30:54,020 --> 02:30:55,790
Why are you doing this?
Right?

3717
02:30:55,970 --> 02:30:56,803
Are you doing this because you want to 
be the person at the podium that 

3718
02:30:58,371 --> 02:30:59,001
everybody's,
you know,

3719
02:30:59,001 --> 02:30:59,834
admiring the,
you want to be the person that 

3720
02:31:00,531 --> 02:31:01,364
everyone's talking about or are you 
sincerely interested in public service 

3721
02:31:04,610 --> 02:31:05,630
and helping things?
I mean,

3722
02:31:05,780 --> 02:31:06,613
what if you,
I can think of 20 people that you would 

3723
02:31:10,311 --> 02:31:11,144
say got,
it'd be interesting to see what that 

3724
02:31:12,591 --> 02:31:14,990
person would do in the presidency,
right?

3725
02:31:14,991 --> 02:31:16,250
Yeah.
But like you said,

3726
02:31:16,280 --> 02:31:18,970
I can't imagine any of them wanting to 
do it to,

3727
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:20,040
none of them are going to want to do

3728
02:31:20,040 --> 02:31:21,660
it.
Mark Cuban has want to be the president.

3729
02:31:21,690 --> 02:31:23,580
Elon Musk's not,
don't want to be the president.

3730
02:31:23,850 --> 02:31:28,170
I think we really need a council.
I think the idea of one second,

3731
02:31:29,020 --> 02:31:31,050
that's what it's supposed to do.
Remember,

3732
02:31:31,220 --> 02:31:32,053
we're supposed to be,
if everybody remembers their founding 

3733
02:31:33,621 --> 02:31:36,830
father federalist papers,
I mean the presidency was a much,

3734
02:31:36,831 --> 02:31:38,540
much,
much less powerful job.

3735
02:31:38,570 --> 02:31:39,403
Right?
This was a country that was run by the 

3736
02:31:40,911 --> 02:31:43,700
legislative branch basically.
Um,

3737
02:31:43,730 --> 02:31:45,890
we're not that way anymore because of a 
whole bunch of things,

3738
02:31:45,891 --> 02:31:47,960
including the nuclear weapons thing we 
talked about earlier.

3739
02:31:48,260 --> 02:31:49,093
The,
the,

3740
02:31:49,120 --> 02:31:54,120
the atomic age changed the presidency 
because of the need to have one person.

3741
02:31:55,700 --> 02:31:59,270
You couldn't declare war anymore because
what if the missiles are on their way to

3742
02:31:59,271 --> 02:32:00,800
you now?
Right.

3743
02:32:00,860 --> 02:32:03,530
Can you really go to Congress and debate
it and have the no,

3744
02:32:03,531 --> 02:32:07,160
you needed a person who within 10 
minutes could launch a counter strike.

3745
02:32:07,370 --> 02:32:08,203
Okay,
well how much power does that take out 

3746
02:32:09,650 --> 02:32:13,220
of the hands of the legislature who was 
supposed to be running things?

3747
02:32:13,221 --> 02:32:15,740
For example,
why do we not declare war anymore?

3748
02:32:16,310 --> 02:32:18,560
We haven't declared war since the Second
World War.

3749
02:32:18,770 --> 02:32:19,603
We have a country that the constitution 
says you can't go to war without a 

3750
02:32:22,251 --> 02:32:25,460
declaration is certainly not that you 
can get some barbary pirates cleared out

3751
02:32:25,461 --> 02:32:26,960
of North Africa,
but you can't,

3752
02:32:26,961 --> 02:32:28,400
like,
that's why Congress,

3753
02:32:28,401 --> 02:32:29,750
by the way,
with the trump thing,

3754
02:32:29,751 --> 02:32:30,584
is they want to say that you can't 
launch nuclear weapons unless less 

3755
02:32:33,171 --> 02:32:36,860
congress has declared war first,
which creates this wonderful thing about

3756
02:32:36,861 --> 02:32:39,740
trying to figure out if we can sort of 
retroactively,

3757
02:32:40,030 --> 02:32:40,863
um,
replace a power that's been gone since 

3758
02:32:43,311 --> 02:32:45,280
1942.
You know,

3759
02:32:45,370 --> 02:32:46,203
when we,
we declared war on like Romania and 

3760
02:32:48,351 --> 02:32:49,184
something else.
You did the subsidiary powers in the 

3761
02:32:50,571 --> 02:32:52,520
Second World War and that's the last 
time it's been done.

3762
02:32:52,760 --> 02:32:53,593
But according to the constitution,
we shouldn't have been able to fight a 

3763
02:32:55,281 --> 02:32:56,570
war since without that.

3764
02:32:56,960 --> 02:32:57,793
It's going to be very interesting to see
what happens in 2020 it's going to be 

3765
02:33:00,291 --> 02:33:04,280
really interesting and I to to remove 
some of the power that the president has

3766
02:33:04,281 --> 02:33:05,114
is going to be a really big uphill 
battle unless some would actually drops 

3767
02:33:07,701 --> 02:33:11,600
a nuke on somebody unless trump decides 
to bomb North Korea.

3768
02:33:11,870 --> 02:33:13,940
Like Kim John owns says something about 
his wife,

3769
02:33:13,941 --> 02:33:14,960
like,
could you piece of shit?

3770
02:33:14,990 --> 02:33:15,823
You fucking launches a bomb Adam.
Unless it's something so egregious and 

3771
02:33:18,501 --> 02:33:19,334
ridiculous like that,
it's going to be really hard to dial 

3772
02:33:21,501 --> 02:33:22,334
back the power without any real specific
need because people are going to 

3773
02:33:25,311 --> 02:33:28,160
concentrate on all the other issues that
the country faces economically,

3774
02:33:28,400 --> 02:33:30,800
militarily,
the need for health care,

3775
02:33:30,801 --> 02:33:32,120
the need for to,
you know,

3776
02:33:32,121 --> 02:33:32,954
environmental standards.
What are we gonna do about global 

3777
02:33:34,281 --> 02:33:35,114
warming?
There's so many issues that take the 

3778
02:33:36,561 --> 02:33:40,100
front stage.
The idea of someone actually launching a

3779
02:33:40,101 --> 02:33:43,190
nuclear attack seems so distant and 
ridiculous,

3780
02:33:43,360 --> 02:33:44,193
but that's not going to be on the 
forefront of everybody's like list of 

3781
02:33:46,101 --> 02:33:47,450
priorities of things to handle.

3782
02:33:47,640 --> 02:33:48,473
Makes me think of Eisenhower ordering 
the local German population at the end 

3783
02:33:54,001 --> 02:33:58,800
of the Second World War to go tour the 
death camps themselves and actually have

3784
02:33:58,801 --> 02:33:59,634
to walk past piles and piles and piles 
of human bodies because he wanted them 

3785
02:34:03,571 --> 02:34:06,030
to not forget why are going to look at 
this.

3786
02:34:06,360 --> 02:34:06,871
And I,
you know,

3787
02:34:06,871 --> 02:34:07,704
I didn't know he did that.
And when you look at the end of the 

3788
02:34:09,151 --> 02:34:10,350
world wars,
for example,

3789
02:34:10,351 --> 02:34:14,130
in both of them,
people were so shocked by what happened.

3790
02:34:14,131 --> 02:34:16,050
You get this idea that we're never 
again,

3791
02:34:16,051 --> 02:34:17,680
right?
We're never going to let this again.

3792
02:34:18,280 --> 02:34:21,250
But you get a generation later,
two generations later.

3793
02:34:21,251 --> 02:34:24,610
How long does it take for those lessons 
to fade away?

3794
02:34:24,910 --> 02:34:25,743
So when I hear or read on twitter,
it's probably some 13 year old boy in 

3795
02:34:28,421 --> 02:34:29,590
his basement.
So you never know.

3796
02:34:29,800 --> 02:34:30,880
But the,
the racial stuff,

3797
02:34:30,881 --> 02:34:33,340
I always think to myself,
if you only,

3798
02:34:33,341 --> 02:34:35,440
you know,
maybe we need some dead bodies out there

3799
02:34:35,441 --> 02:34:37,600
so you can go see,
this is what it looks like,

3800
02:34:37,630 --> 02:34:39,370
right?
We're not fooling around here.

3801
02:34:39,371 --> 02:34:41,930
This kind of stuff leads to this,
uh,

3802
02:34:41,950 --> 02:34:45,340
stop fooling around with 140 characters 
and look at what real death tastes,

3803
02:34:45,341 --> 02:34:46,174
smells like and what the long term 
ramifications of pushing these sorts of 

3804
02:34:49,751 --> 02:34:53,350
attitudes can lead to and has over and 
over and over again.

3805
02:34:53,470 --> 02:34:54,303
Well,
I think there's a real problem with the 

3806
02:34:55,241 --> 02:34:58,990
human condition when it comes to 
complacency and comfort.

3807
02:34:59,050 --> 02:34:59,883
And I think that we get real comfortable
in real complacent and we have a very 

3808
02:35:02,861 --> 02:35:05,830
distorted idea of what life is without 
struggle.

3809
02:35:06,070 --> 02:35:10,180
And there's a great book by Sebastian 
younger who was on last week and uh,

3810
02:35:10,200 --> 02:35:13,300
it's called tribe and he did a perfect 
storm too,

3811
02:35:13,301 --> 02:35:14,890
is wonderful.
He's amazing.

3812
02:35:15,130 --> 02:35:15,963
But talking to him about what happens 
when people overcome significant 

3813
02:35:22,361 --> 02:35:25,300
tragedies,
whether it's war or whether it's natural

3814
02:35:25,301 --> 02:35:27,760
disasters or you know,
I was in,

3815
02:35:28,210 --> 02:35:32,530
I was in New York right after nine 11 
and it was palpable,

3816
02:35:32,590 --> 02:35:35,590
the sense of community and how friendly 
people were.

3817
02:35:35,860 --> 02:35:36,693
And it was because people had had their 
world shaken up by an attack and it 

3818
02:35:40,241 --> 02:35:41,074
literally did good.
It really did good for the people that 

3819
02:35:43,871 --> 02:35:44,704
survive in a fucked up way.
But it makes me think of that project 

3820
02:35:47,051 --> 02:35:50,140
for a new America document that before 
nine 11 had said that there's,

3821
02:35:50,380 --> 02:35:51,213
you know,
without some kind of Pearl Harbor style 

3822
02:35:52,901 --> 02:35:53,734
attack,
the American system is designed right 

3823
02:35:55,181 --> 02:35:57,550
now in a way where people are gonna pull
apart more and more.

3824
02:35:58,150 --> 02:35:59,140
In other words,
just saying,

3825
02:35:59,141 --> 02:35:59,974
you know,
you can almost wish for something like 

3826
02:36:01,091 --> 02:36:01,924
that to happen to pull us together.
I remember when I was horrible thought 

3827
02:36:04,571 --> 02:36:05,111
though,
right?

3828
02:36:05,111 --> 02:36:05,944
Yeah.
And maybe maybe it's the only way we 

3829
02:36:07,121 --> 02:36:07,954
learn and you need the refresher,
but that's what I think people need war 

3830
02:36:10,511 --> 02:36:13,030
in their own life and I think they need 
struggle.

3831
02:36:13,090 --> 02:36:13,923
I need structure.
They need something to do in their own 

3832
02:36:16,001 --> 02:36:16,834
life that's incredibly difficult to keep
them from being this to many of us not 

3833
02:36:20,201 --> 02:36:21,850
place it in mundane.
When I was,

3834
02:36:21,940 --> 02:36:24,600
when I was um,
trying to localize the story from the,

3835
02:36:24,601 --> 02:36:25,434
the,
the Yugoslavian civil war that we were 

3836
02:36:26,561 --> 02:36:27,394
just talking about earlier,
I interviewed a Croatian man in Eugene 

3837
02:36:30,280 --> 02:36:31,113
and we were talking about it and I was 
bringing up these age old hatreds and 

3838
02:36:33,641 --> 02:36:34,391
basically saying,
you know,

3839
02:36:34,391 --> 02:36:35,920
they've always hated each other and he 
stopped me.

3840
02:36:35,920 --> 02:36:36,221
He said,
no,

3841
02:36:36,221 --> 02:36:36,671
stop,
stop,

3842
02:36:36,671 --> 02:36:37,600
stop.
He goes,

3843
02:36:37,601 --> 02:36:38,890
we didn't,
he goes,

3844
02:36:39,130 --> 02:36:41,920
up until recently we were intermarrying 
with each other.

3845
02:36:42,010 --> 02:36:43,870
We got along,
it was all working out.

3846
02:36:43,871 --> 02:36:44,920
He goes,
do you know what changed?

3847
02:36:44,921 --> 02:36:45,251
I said,
what?

3848
02:36:45,251 --> 02:36:46,390
He goes,
the economy tanked.

3849
02:36:46,750 --> 02:36:49,000
He goes,
and all of a sudden he goes,

3850
02:36:49,001 --> 02:36:53,080
the first thing that started to 
resurface when everybody was just hating

3851
02:36:53,081 --> 02:36:54,390
everything,
their lives and the,

3852
02:36:54,520 --> 02:36:55,930
and everything he has,
all of a sudden,

3853
02:36:55,931 --> 02:36:59,350
all these old things that had been 
buried just came right back.

3854
02:36:59,710 --> 02:37:01,750
And so that tribalism you're talking 
about were younger.

3855
02:37:02,020 --> 02:37:03,760
I think there are times,
and you had mentioned it,

3856
02:37:03,761 --> 02:37:04,594
right,
post postwar errors these times when 

3857
02:37:06,041 --> 02:37:07,420
they go away,
most disasters,

3858
02:37:07,950 --> 02:37:10,270
but then certain kinds of conditions,
for example,

3859
02:37:10,271 --> 02:37:12,460
terrible economic conditions for too 
many people.

3860
02:37:12,670 --> 02:37:16,010
It's funny how quickly the scape goats 
come and and

3861
02:37:16,010 --> 02:37:17,670
things that,
I mean truthfully,

3862
02:37:17,671 --> 02:37:20,510
you mean the biggest thing that I've 
missed politically in terms of just,

3863
02:37:20,810 --> 02:37:23,540
I just didn't see it was the resurgence 
of the racism,

3864
02:37:23,541 --> 02:37:24,710
bigotry,
prejudice thing.

3865
02:37:24,711 --> 02:37:25,790
I mean I thought,
you know,

3866
02:37:25,791 --> 02:37:26,624
we grew up in the era where our country 
was trying to figure out through things 

3867
02:37:28,851 --> 02:37:31,370
like broadcasting,
how we transition.

3868
02:37:31,371 --> 02:37:33,260
So you remember all in the family when 
it started?

3869
02:37:33,261 --> 02:37:34,094
Yeah.
It's a show that doesn't even run very 

3870
02:37:34,881 --> 02:37:35,714
much anymore because simply trying to 
address those issues is too hot button 

3871
02:37:39,171 --> 02:37:40,550
for most advertisers.
Now.

3872
02:37:40,580 --> 02:37:42,580
You could never have an archibald.
No.

3873
02:37:42,590 --> 02:37:43,423
And,
but that whole show was part of 

3874
02:37:44,661 --> 02:37:49,661
society's attempt to transition from an 
era where it wasn't that long beforehand

3875
02:37:49,941 --> 02:37:53,390
where you couldn't stay in a hotel that 
wasn't a black or a white person's hotel

3876
02:37:53,391 --> 02:37:55,670
in the south to one where we got now.
And I always thought,

3877
02:37:55,671 --> 02:37:56,504
okay,
the message of Archie bunker was they 

3878
02:37:57,771 --> 02:37:58,604
would try to teach him,
the young people would try to teach you 

3879
02:38:00,921 --> 02:38:01,754
about how to be a more open human being,
but it didn't matter because the archie 

3880
02:38:04,761 --> 02:38:06,440
bunker's of the world,
we're going to die off.

3881
02:38:06,590 --> 02:38:08,330
They were the dinosaurs from another 
era.

3882
02:38:08,331 --> 02:38:11,180
And eventually that would be a way of 
looking at things.

3883
02:38:11,181 --> 02:38:12,900
That was in the past.
And I,

3884
02:38:13,010 --> 02:38:14,750
I thought that that was what it was 
going to be.

3885
02:38:15,050 --> 02:38:17,090
And I never,
I never saw the resurgence,

3886
02:38:17,091 --> 02:38:17,924
but like my Croatian friend had said,
just maybe things had to get bad enough 

3887
02:38:21,231 --> 02:38:24,290
economically and whatever for all the 
tribal things to just come back.

3888
02:38:24,291 --> 02:38:26,810
Cause that's,
there's something deep in us that that's

3889
02:38:26,811 --> 02:38:29,780
all embedded in.
I think there's far less of those people

3890
02:38:29,790 --> 02:38:32,860
that are allowed for,
that's,

3891
02:38:32,960 --> 02:38:34,100
that's done.
Me Too.

3892
02:38:34,220 --> 02:38:35,053
And it's so homogenized when he's seen 
what they're fucking home depot torches 

3893
02:38:37,821 --> 02:38:38,654
walking on this tree,
the Tiki torches dorks that the whole 

3894
02:38:41,601 --> 02:38:43,580
thing was.
So what did you hear Richard Spencer?

3895
02:38:43,581 --> 02:38:44,351
He did the,
the,

3896
02:38:44,351 --> 02:38:45,800
the,
the white supremacists.

3897
02:38:46,200 --> 02:38:47,270
But if he did it,
he did an,

3898
02:38:47,330 --> 02:38:48,163
uh,
an interview about two weeks ago where 

3899
02:38:49,461 --> 02:38:50,294
he was basically saying slavery was good
and all these kinds of things that 

3900
02:38:52,791 --> 02:38:55,070
British man got the eds and stuff.

3901
02:38:55,070 --> 02:38:56,630
They're like,
you're an idiot or whatever.

3902
02:38:56,780 --> 02:38:57,613
But I mean it wasn't,
it was,

3903
02:38:57,910 --> 02:39:01,370
it was a ridiculous thing to say.
And yet normally,

3904
02:39:01,371 --> 02:39:03,860
and you know,
you remember 60 minutes used to have the

3905
02:39:03,861 --> 02:39:08,420
KKK white supremacists guys in the old 
days on like once a year they didn't,

3906
02:39:08,421 --> 02:39:09,254
if you'd like the grand dragon or 
whatever and they give them a lot of 

3907
02:39:11,331 --> 02:39:14,180
airtime and Mike Wallace would question 
and at the end of that,

3908
02:39:14,181 --> 02:39:17,120
you just always thought the same thing.
These people are idiots,

3909
02:39:17,180 --> 02:39:17,780
right?
And you know,

3910
02:39:17,780 --> 02:39:21,560
it was the give them enough rope and 
they'll hang themselves type journalism.

3911
02:39:21,760 --> 02:39:22,593
I thought that that the journalists,
like everybody was talking about that 

3912
02:39:24,930 --> 02:39:26,690
the guy did the perfect interview with 
them.

3913
02:39:26,691 --> 02:39:29,930
But I honestly think that's not the way 
to do the perfect interview with them.

3914
02:39:29,990 --> 02:39:32,690
I think that guy standing up there 
standing up facing each other,

3915
02:39:32,691 --> 02:39:34,790
I think they'd be far better off if they
sat down.

3916
02:39:35,030 --> 02:39:35,863
And if they talked for a long period of 
time and I think there's plenty more 

3917
02:39:38,511 --> 02:39:40,550
rope in that car.
Could've hung them way better.

3918
02:39:40,840 --> 02:39:41,673
There's a,
there's a book by a black gentleman who 

3919
02:39:42,761 --> 02:39:45,170
is a musician,
a Boogie woogie piano player.

3920
02:39:45,171 --> 02:39:46,760
I don't remember his name.
This is what is that?

3921
02:39:46,850 --> 02:39:47,900
It was a,
it was a book on,

3922
02:39:48,290 --> 02:39:49,580
yeah,
but it was a style.

3923
02:39:49,581 --> 02:39:51,440
It was a book on the class.
Um,

3924
02:39:51,510 --> 02:39:53,270
and,
and he was a guy,

3925
02:39:53,271 --> 02:39:56,240
a black man who I'm going from memory 
here,

3926
02:39:56,241 --> 02:39:58,400
but he likes set up an interview with 
one of the heads of the,

3927
02:39:58,401 --> 02:39:59,234
of the state clan or whatever.
It didn't tell the guy who was coming 

3928
02:40:01,701 --> 02:40:02,534
that he was a black man and they have,
so they had this interview and if this 

3929
02:40:05,061 --> 02:40:07,820
interesting thing he says,
but long story short,

3930
02:40:07,821 --> 02:40:08,654
he started to make friends with these 
KKK members and it wasn't like rank and 

3931
02:40:11,331 --> 02:40:11,990
file people.

3932
02:40:11,990 --> 02:40:13,920
It was like the Grand Dragon,
whatever.

3933
02:40:14,130 --> 02:40:14,963
That's the guy.
How one man convinced 200 Klu Klux Klan 

3934
02:40:17,971 --> 02:40:21,320
members to give up their roles.
That motherfucker.

3935
02:40:21,420 --> 02:40:24,240
But long story short is,
I mean these were the cal Davis.

3936
02:40:24,300 --> 02:40:26,730
They didn't have any black people.
They knew,

3937
02:40:26,850 --> 02:40:29,070
right?
They had stereotypes and things.

3938
02:40:29,190 --> 02:40:31,620
So he said once you're,
like you had said,

3939
02:40:31,621 --> 02:40:34,650
when you're face to face with somebody 
and you have to interact with them on an

3940
02:40:34,680 --> 02:40:36,870
eye to eye level,
it's,

3941
02:40:37,590 --> 02:40:41,160
it's very intriguing what he did because
you say to yourself,

3942
02:40:41,161 --> 02:40:41,994
okay,
you can never reach these archie bunker 

3943
02:40:43,021 --> 02:40:45,190
guys,
but people have and do and,

3944
02:40:45,191 --> 02:40:46,024
and I do want to say,
listen for all of the white 

3945
02:40:47,251 --> 02:40:49,440
supremacists,
other than think I'm being unfair,

3946
02:40:49,950 --> 02:40:54,050
this racial tribal thing is all over the
place because there are,

3947
02:40:54,060 --> 02:40:54,893
you know,
like you will meet black folks who are 

3948
02:40:56,041 --> 02:40:56,874
racist too.
Now what I always say to people though 

3949
02:40:58,321 --> 02:40:59,154
is the one thing you have to understand 
as a white person that's different is 

3950
02:41:01,711 --> 02:41:02,970
we're the dominant culture.

3951
02:41:03,270 --> 02:41:05,160
Okay?
It does make things different.

3952
02:41:05,161 --> 02:41:07,950
If you are a minority in any country,
there's a tendency,

3953
02:41:08,100 --> 02:41:08,930
I mean,
you go to the place,

3954
02:41:08,930 --> 02:41:10,260
they'll have neighborhoods,
right?

3955
02:41:10,261 --> 02:41:11,790
Remember the Italian neighborhoods in 
our country,

3956
02:41:11,791 --> 02:41:13,290
that Jewish neighborhood,
the Irish neighborhoods,

3957
02:41:13,291 --> 02:41:15,090
why did they do that?
Where they racist?

3958
02:41:15,240 --> 02:41:15,960
No,
there's,

3959
02:41:15,960 --> 02:41:18,420
there's some strength in gathering with 
your own kind,

3960
02:41:18,421 --> 02:41:21,300
reading your own newspapers and keeping 
your culture along language.

3961
02:41:21,330 --> 02:41:21,990
That's right.
But,

3962
02:41:21,990 --> 02:41:24,360
but it's also a self defense mechanism,
right?

3963
02:41:24,540 --> 02:41:26,640
So it's a very different thing to say,
well listen,

3964
02:41:26,641 --> 02:41:29,970
there are being racist to okay,
but we're the dominant culture.

3965
02:41:29,971 --> 02:41:30,804
And it means that there's something a 
little different when we say what's 

3966
02:41:32,671 --> 02:41:33,900
wrong with saying,
you know,

3967
02:41:33,901 --> 02:41:36,930
white people should be proud of their 
heritage to theoretically nothing.

3968
02:41:37,320 --> 02:41:38,153
But historically speaking,
there are some issues and you need to 

3969
02:41:40,111 --> 02:41:40,944
recognize that.
Not can we ever get to a time when we 

3970
02:41:42,331 --> 02:41:44,490
can judge people by the content of their
character.

3971
02:41:44,970 --> 02:41:46,110
I don't know.
But I think if,

3972
02:41:46,170 --> 02:41:48,510
I think even if white people said we're 
going to do that right now,

3973
02:41:48,511 --> 02:41:50,040
there'd be people of other colors going,
no,

3974
02:41:50,041 --> 02:41:51,510
wait a minute.
We don't want to give up.

3975
02:41:51,810 --> 02:41:52,351
Uh,
you know,

3976
02:41:52,351 --> 02:41:54,630
some extra admissions into universities 
and we don't,

3977
02:41:55,050 --> 02:41:58,770
it becomes a very difficult thing to 
give up this racial identity.

3978
02:41:59,130 --> 02:42:00,660
Um,
in the 60s,

3979
02:42:00,661 --> 02:42:03,030
that was the goal.
Now people on all sides,

3980
02:42:03,031 --> 02:42:03,960
it'd be,
what are you talking about?

3981
02:42:03,961 --> 02:42:04,591
It very,
you know,

3982
02:42:04,591 --> 02:42:07,590
the cultural appropriation thing drives 
me crazy.

3983
02:42:07,800 --> 02:42:08,633
Like if you're going to have dreadlocks,
you can't because that's a black 

3984
02:42:10,921 --> 02:42:11,754
hairstyle.
What are we want to say is don't black 

3985
02:42:13,101 --> 02:42:15,400
people want to try different hairstyles 
to the cre?

3986
02:42:15,630 --> 02:42:16,463
Create creativity is putting things 
together that never went together 

3987
02:42:19,381 --> 02:42:20,214
before.
This is that it's not even a 

3988
02:42:21,721 --> 02:42:23,940
historically correct.
You know as well as I do,

3989
02:42:23,941 --> 02:42:24,774
the dreadlocks had been around for a 
long fucking time with white people 

3990
02:42:27,110 --> 02:42:30,250
about how it just polarizes us even more
if you read this once.

3991
02:42:30,350 --> 02:42:33,960
Not Real though is people looking for 
things to be polarized.

3992
02:42:34,230 --> 02:42:34,950
Yes,
and I,

3993
02:42:34,950 --> 02:42:35,783
and again,
I do think and I love academia and I 

3994
02:42:37,180 --> 02:42:38,580
could've,
I could've got swept up.

3995
02:42:38,581 --> 02:42:41,010
I enjoyed school at the college level so
much.

3996
02:42:41,011 --> 02:42:42,390
I could still be there today.
I mean,

3997
02:42:42,391 --> 02:42:44,480
I've never gotten a job.
I would just be one of those guys.

3998
02:42:44,550 --> 02:42:47,310
I'm a graduate student at 51 helping the
professors,

3999
02:42:47,490 --> 02:42:48,690
but at the same time,
look,

4000
02:42:48,900 --> 02:42:49,733
we all understand that those people are 
incentivized to come up with new 

4001
02:42:52,321 --> 02:42:53,400
theories,
new ideas,

4002
02:42:53,401 --> 02:42:54,570
groundbreaking,
cutting edge,

4003
02:42:54,870 --> 02:42:55,703
you know,
this is what they're rewarded for with 

4004
02:42:56,551 --> 02:42:58,230
the carrots and sticks.
So I get it.

4005
02:42:58,380 --> 02:43:01,080
It's different when it spreads to the 
general culture a little bit though,

4006
02:43:01,081 --> 02:43:04,140
because now we're not in the ivory tower
having a theoretical debate.

4007
02:43:04,440 --> 02:43:06,960
We're sitting there going,
should that person be shamed on twitter?

4008
02:43:06,961 --> 02:43:08,940
Cause he's a Asian person with 
dreadlocks.

4009
02:43:09,180 --> 02:43:10,140
Okay.
Folks,

4010
02:43:10,170 --> 02:43:13,300
if you don't see that might backfire on 
you down the road.

4011
02:43:13,301 --> 02:43:14,134
I mean,
we've all got to cut each other some 

4012
02:43:15,071 --> 02:43:17,350
slack on all sides.
If we're gonna make this work.

4013
02:43:17,380 --> 02:43:18,213
Well,
it's cultural appropriation is one of 

4014
02:43:19,661 --> 02:43:21,940
the things that makes America so 
fascinating.

4015
02:43:22,150 --> 02:43:22,983
Literally the melting pot of humans all 
together exploring each other's food 

4016
02:43:27,391 --> 02:43:28,224
and,
and all the various aspects of their 

4017
02:43:29,921 --> 02:43:30,754
communities.
The funny part is the cultural 

4018
02:43:31,721 --> 02:43:35,470
appropriators out there are sometimes 
the most sympathetic to that side.

4019
02:43:35,550 --> 02:43:37,210
I mean,
if you're willing to get,

4020
02:43:37,240 --> 02:43:37,750
uh,
uh,

4021
02:43:37,750 --> 02:43:38,583
Rastafarians hairstyle,
you're probably not an anti black 

4022
02:43:41,171 --> 02:43:42,004
racist,
right?

4023
02:43:42,130 --> 02:43:44,590
So when you tell them that they 
shouldn't be doing that,

4024
02:43:45,190 --> 02:43:46,023
aren't you going after the people most 
likely to see your side of things and 

4025
02:43:49,511 --> 02:43:51,040
help you and push angels as to what I'm 
saying?

4026
02:43:51,041 --> 02:43:54,070
It's almost like we're eating our own on
that.

4027
02:43:54,180 --> 02:43:56,620
And on the left,
it is particularly about eating your own

4028
02:43:56,621 --> 02:43:59,760
because you can't be progressive enough.
There's always going to be someone who's

4029
02:43:59,770 --> 02:44:01,660
more progressive.
And that just how we think,

4030
02:44:01,740 --> 02:44:04,030
you know,
when I was a punk back in the old days,

4031
02:44:04,031 --> 02:44:04,864
and I remember saying that we're,
we're killing the movement because the 

4032
02:44:06,941 --> 02:44:09,550
biggest thing was,
was this idea of a poser,

4033
02:44:09,790 --> 02:44:11,220
right?
And the first thing everybody said,

4034
02:44:11,320 --> 02:44:12,880
we didn't welcome you into the group.
We said,

4035
02:44:12,881 --> 02:44:14,110
when did you start wearing these 
clothes?

4036
02:44:14,111 --> 02:44:15,640
When did you get that hairstyle?
You pose her,

4037
02:44:15,641 --> 02:44:17,860
in other words,
the entire thing was exclusive,

4038
02:44:18,010 --> 02:44:19,840
right?
So you tried to build this movement,

4039
02:44:19,900 --> 02:44:22,450
you have to be an Oji degree.
It was ridiculous.

4040
02:44:22,451 --> 02:44:23,284
And then many years you have to be a 
punk for before you're allowed to be 

4041
02:44:25,040 --> 02:44:26,980
upon.
You go in slowly.

4042
02:44:27,330 --> 02:44:28,001
I mean,
I remember them,

4043
02:44:28,001 --> 02:44:30,200
they were going after like John lied and
Johnny Rotten.

4044
02:44:30,280 --> 02:44:32,800
You're a poser.
Okay then what are we doing here?

4045
02:44:33,720 --> 02:44:34,553
But I mean in the same way,
the one thing you have to do is cut 

4046
02:44:36,731 --> 02:44:37,564
people some slack.
And the one thing we human beings seem 

4047
02:44:39,311 --> 02:44:41,210
to have such a problem with is cutting 
people.

4048
02:44:41,211 --> 02:44:42,490
Slack and I,
it seems to be,

4049
02:44:42,970 --> 02:44:43,803
if you say the social media seems to be 
worse because you'll cut somebody slap 

4050
02:44:46,370 --> 02:44:49,000
face to face more easily than you will.
You know,

4051
02:44:49,001 --> 02:44:51,370
when you can just throw 140 characters 
and you go to bed.

4052
02:44:51,371 --> 02:44:53,920
But that comedian on the other side of 
your hundred and 40 characters,

4053
02:44:54,130 --> 02:44:55,180
I mean,
let me just,

4054
02:44:55,360 --> 02:44:56,193
you've seen this and I've seen this,
but if you've never been on the 

4055
02:44:57,341 --> 02:45:01,370
receiving end of these things where Pete
and I've been very lucky and people have

4056
02:45:01,371 --> 02:45:03,540
been very nice and kind to me,
but even I,

4057
02:45:03,550 --> 02:45:04,660
when you read these things,
you go,

4058
02:45:04,661 --> 02:45:06,160
who is this person?

4059
02:45:06,530 --> 02:45:08,710
Why do they think that this is,
did they,

4060
02:45:08,740 --> 02:45:10,870
did their lives get better?
Cause they texted me this.

4061
02:45:10,871 --> 02:45:11,704
I mean,
do you see what I'm saying?

4062
02:45:11,920 --> 02:45:14,230
I don't get the motivation.
They don't even know it.

4063
02:45:14,260 --> 02:45:16,540
They don't even know thinking about it.
They're just acting.

4064
02:45:16,541 --> 02:45:19,240
It's a human instinct.
They hurt and they want to hurt others.

4065
02:45:19,500 --> 02:45:21,460
They,
that's what you told me years ago.

4066
02:45:21,790 --> 02:45:22,890
You told me that that's what,
Hey,

4067
02:45:22,960 --> 02:45:25,810
you've helped me a lot when I look at 
those things and I think he chose,

4068
02:45:25,811 --> 02:45:28,810
right Joe,
this is people that are angry with their

4069
02:45:28,811 --> 02:45:30,700
situation and their,
what did,

4070
02:45:30,820 --> 02:45:31,653
what did they say?
It's like the crabs in a pot and one 

4071
02:45:33,350 --> 02:45:36,040
crab crabs in a bucket and you pull the 
crab down.

4072
02:45:36,310 --> 02:45:38,380
Um,
and it's too bad because you know what?

4073
02:45:38,381 --> 02:45:41,160
A lot of those people are the very 
people who could be doing much better if

4074
02:45:41,161 --> 02:45:41,994
we,
if we could figure out a way to help 

4075
02:45:42,671 --> 02:45:47,671
empower them to unleash their been 
haters that aren't haters anymore.

4076
02:45:48,190 --> 02:45:50,310
And unfortunately a lot of people have 
already blocked them.

4077
02:45:50,400 --> 02:45:51,233
Oh,
just,

4078
02:45:51,310 --> 02:45:52,143
Oh,
just dissatisfied people that are so 

4079
02:45:53,081 --> 02:45:54,820
upset with the way things are.
I mean I really,

4080
02:45:55,480 --> 02:45:56,313
I would love to see more effort made in 
that regard because I think the 

4081
02:45:58,481 --> 02:46:02,080
subsidiary down the road domino effects 
would help us all so much.

4082
02:46:02,081 --> 02:46:02,914
But listen,
we're a country that can't even get the 

4083
02:46:04,331 --> 02:46:05,164
most basic things passed.
How are we going to get something like 

4084
02:46:06,761 --> 02:46:09,010
that done?
I think change is happening.

4085
02:46:09,050 --> 02:46:10,460
I think it's happening incredibly

4086
02:46:10,460 --> 02:46:12,800
rapidly,
but I think we're stuck in the mix of it

4087
02:46:12,801 --> 02:46:13,634
and we don't realize it.
It's sort of like when you come over 

4088
02:46:15,231 --> 02:46:16,064
someone's house and you haven't been 
over there house in like five years and 

4089
02:46:18,321 --> 02:46:19,700
all of sudden their kid is 10 you're 
like,

4090
02:46:19,910 --> 02:46:21,470
Holy Shit,
you're 10 now.

4091
02:46:21,740 --> 02:46:26,740
To them it just happened gradually and 
slowly and they barely have noticed.

4092
02:46:27,411 --> 02:46:28,244
Yup.
But to you when you take five years off 

4093
02:46:29,901 --> 02:46:30,980
and then you see that kid,
you're like,

4094
02:46:30,981 --> 02:46:33,210
holy sugar in the hot water.
Right?

4095
02:46:33,650 --> 02:46:36,230
It's happening.
It is happening,

4096
02:46:36,530 --> 02:46:37,363
but it's just how I see this is where I 
can't again in the maelstrom trying to 

4097
02:46:39,591 --> 02:46:42,320
analysts,
but is it positive or negative?

4098
02:46:42,350 --> 02:46:43,620
Now you're an author.
I was just like,

4099
02:46:43,640 --> 02:46:44,421
you're an optimist,
Joe.

4100
02:46:44,421 --> 02:46:45,254
We'd had this conversation before and 
I'm a little bit more cynical and 

4101
02:46:47,090 --> 02:46:48,440
misanthropic may be.
Um,

4102
02:46:48,680 --> 02:46:50,870
but I,
I worry about,

4103
02:46:50,900 --> 02:46:52,190
um,
figuring it out.

4104
02:46:52,190 --> 02:46:53,023
So if you say that human beings 
individually and as groups learn by 

4105
02:46:55,551 --> 02:46:56,700
mistakes.
Yeah.

4106
02:46:56,720 --> 02:46:59,540
So you have to have a Holocaust type 
mistake to,

4107
02:46:59,580 --> 02:47:01,280
to come out of this before we go.
Wow.

4108
02:47:01,281 --> 02:47:02,114
Well,
here's where we screwed up on that 

4109
02:47:02,841 --> 02:47:04,400
social media thing.
I mean,

4110
02:47:04,401 --> 02:47:06,680
I wonder whether we're going to be 
allowed.

4111
02:47:06,681 --> 02:47:07,514
I would not,
I don't know how you would turn the 

4112
02:47:08,121 --> 02:47:09,680
genie,
put the genie back in the bottle.

4113
02:47:10,070 --> 02:47:14,300
But I mean at what point do terrorists 
or dangerous people are,

4114
02:47:14,301 --> 02:47:15,134
I mean,
look at the,

4115
02:47:15,440 --> 02:47:16,273
to go back to that weather underground 
new left bombing thing that I said that 

4116
02:47:18,501 --> 02:47:20,150
they didn't know the south,
they'd like me,

4117
02:47:20,220 --> 02:47:21,860
uh,
waterboarding Abbie Hoffman.

4118
02:47:22,310 --> 02:47:24,770
But I mean,
if you'd had a bunch of people back then

4119
02:47:25,010 --> 02:47:27,170
with twitter saying,
I support the,

4120
02:47:27,290 --> 02:47:28,880
the Abby Hoffman's,
I supported that.

4121
02:47:29,330 --> 02:47:31,550
Okay.
At what point would the government first

4122
02:47:31,551 --> 02:47:32,990
of all get you on a watch list then?

4123
02:47:32,990 --> 02:47:33,823
Or Now?
But at what point would somebody have 

4124
02:47:34,971 --> 02:47:36,200
said,
listen for our own good,

4125
02:47:36,201 --> 02:47:37,034
we can't have average Americans because 
look how many terrorists are using this 

4126
02:47:39,981 --> 02:47:40,814
tool.
I mean,

4127
02:47:41,180 --> 02:47:42,013
we'll see what happens.
But you'd mentioned nine 11 and how you 

4128
02:47:44,071 --> 02:47:46,580
know so much of that they were,
there was a feeling of community and all

4129
02:47:46,581 --> 02:47:48,320
that other stuff,
but there was other things too.

4130
02:47:48,530 --> 02:47:50,300
There were,
there was the government literally,

4131
02:47:50,301 --> 02:47:51,134
and I remember Peter Defazio's,
the congressmen a up in Oregon who said 

4132
02:47:53,421 --> 02:47:54,410
this to me.
He said,

4133
02:47:54,411 --> 02:47:55,244
Dan,
he said there were bills that had been 

4134
02:47:56,991 --> 02:47:57,824
written and put on a shelf because there
was no way to pass them for the longest 

4135
02:48:01,251 --> 02:48:02,330
time.
And he goes,

4136
02:48:02,331 --> 02:48:05,660
when nine 11 happened,
they pulled all those bills down,

4137
02:48:05,930 --> 02:48:08,250
cobbled them into one thing and send it 
back.

4138
02:48:08,510 --> 02:48:10,670
And then he said,
here's the real scandal.

4139
02:48:10,671 --> 02:48:11,690
And most people don't know this.

4140
02:48:11,690 --> 02:48:12,523
He says,
do you know how many parts that bill 

4141
02:48:13,431 --> 02:48:16,460
were blank that we signed to be filled 
in later?

4142
02:48:16,640 --> 02:48:17,930
He said,
that's not unusual.

4143
02:48:17,960 --> 02:48:18,793
He goes,
because we get a lot of bills that they 

4144
02:48:19,641 --> 02:48:22,310
haven't figured out all the details 
because most bills aren't as important.

4145
02:48:22,311 --> 02:48:23,144
Is that when he goes,
we signed off to a bunch of things with 

4146
02:48:24,651 --> 02:48:27,500
a bunch of blank categories to be filled
in later.

4147
02:48:28,070 --> 02:48:28,903
Okay.
It gets us back to leadership right 

4148
02:48:30,141 --> 02:48:31,070
there.
What's wrong with the country?

4149
02:48:31,071 --> 02:48:33,650
A bunch of people signing a bunch of 
stuff that have nothing in it yet.

4150
02:48:34,640 --> 02:48:36,630
Like I said before,
when you're talking about it,

4151
02:48:36,631 --> 02:48:39,320
like are you optimistic?
Are you pessimistic?

4152
02:48:39,321 --> 02:48:41,360
Is it negative or is it positive?
It's both.

4153
02:48:41,540 --> 02:48:45,350
And I think the negative and the 
positive are both necessary.

4154
02:48:45,530 --> 02:48:46,363
I don't think we're gonna live in this 
utopian world where everybody's just 

4155
02:48:48,351 --> 02:48:49,184
friendly to each other.
I think people are going to make 

4156
02:48:50,241 --> 02:48:51,920
mistakes.
They're going to be shitty.

4157
02:48:52,100 --> 02:48:52,933
They're going to realize that their 
shitty and the understanding of that 

4158
02:48:55,791 --> 02:48:56,624
behavior and the ramifications of that 
behavior is becoming more and more 

4159
02:48:59,121 --> 02:48:59,954
apparent every day.
And I think we're seeing that and I 

4160
02:49:02,241 --> 02:49:03,074
think we're caught up in this storm and 
there's a fucking hurricane going on 

4161
02:49:06,261 --> 02:49:08,250
man.
This cows by and bathtubs

4162
02:49:08,310 --> 02:49:11,760
in the air.
All this stuff is happening right now.

4163
02:49:12,200 --> 02:49:13,910
The hope is though that we could get to 
the good cause.

4164
02:49:13,940 --> 02:49:15,710
I might agree with you at the long term,
right?

4165
02:49:15,711 --> 02:49:17,630
If you're saying optimistic real long 
term,

4166
02:49:18,020 --> 02:49:18,853
but how many,
I mean if you said in 1900 I'm 

4167
02:49:20,571 --> 02:49:24,140
optimistic long term that by the year 
2000 things will be better.

4168
02:49:24,290 --> 02:49:25,123
Yes.
But you have two world wars to go 

4169
02:49:26,091 --> 02:49:28,610
through in the interim and the nude near
misses on nuclear wars.

4170
02:49:28,820 --> 02:49:32,540
So I can agree with you that long term 
we may have a positive outcome here.

4171
02:49:32,541 --> 02:49:33,374
I don't know what our immediate short 
term with you and I have 2030 40 you 

4172
02:49:36,471 --> 02:49:38,270
probably have a hundred years left on 
your lifespan,

4173
02:49:38,450 --> 02:49:41,250
but some of us are not in great shape.
So I'm hunt.

4174
02:49:41,420 --> 02:49:42,253
She said the next 2025 30 years,
are you going to see good or bad from 

4175
02:49:45,201 --> 02:49:46,034
this?
We may have to go through some learning 

4176
02:49:47,301 --> 02:49:50,210
experiences and those tend to not be so 
fun to live through.

4177
02:49:50,370 --> 02:49:51,300
Yeah,
there's that.

4178
02:49:51,301 --> 02:49:54,360
But also there's like how bout just 
disengaged from that?

4179
02:49:54,361 --> 02:49:55,950
Every now and then.
I agree with you.

4180
02:49:55,980 --> 02:49:56,813
Don't have your life completely 
dependent upon the success and failures 

4181
02:49:59,611 --> 02:50:01,710
of other people's emotions and ideas 
like it.

4182
02:50:01,711 --> 02:50:06,270
Just go off on your own more often.
Spend more time by yourself,

4183
02:50:06,271 --> 02:50:07,104
more time pursuing your own activity.
Spend more time in nature with your 

4184
02:50:09,571 --> 02:50:10,980
phone off.
Spend more time,

4185
02:50:11,470 --> 02:50:13,590
really good idea to cause giant.
Yes,

4186
02:50:13,810 --> 02:50:15,120
and you know what?
Because folks,

4187
02:50:15,121 --> 02:50:18,540
that's what connects you to all the 
other human beings who ever lived before

4188
02:50:18,541 --> 02:50:18,921
us.
That the,

4189
02:50:18,921 --> 02:50:19,754
the,
the thing that makes our time period 

4190
02:50:20,521 --> 02:50:21,354
different here,
this vast human experiment is we've 

4191
02:50:23,221 --> 02:50:25,140
never had a generation growing up with 
mobile phones,

4192
02:50:25,141 --> 02:50:26,700
for example.
What does that mean?

4193
02:50:26,701 --> 02:50:27,534
Well,
one thing it does is it takes you away 

4194
02:50:28,651 --> 02:50:29,484
from the part that your aunts,
I mean looking up at a night sky with 

4195
02:50:32,971 --> 02:50:33,804
nothing to do for hours,
just sitting there contemplating the 

4196
02:50:36,211 --> 02:50:38,490
silence or the rustling of the trees or 
whatever.

4197
02:50:39,030 --> 02:50:40,890
I don't know if you get anything out of 
that or not,

4198
02:50:40,920 --> 02:50:41,753
but that's something that human beings 
have done since caveman times that 

4199
02:50:44,851 --> 02:50:47,280
you're sharing an experience that's 
innately human.

4200
02:50:47,520 --> 02:50:51,150
If that becomes less and less common 
because we're detached from that.

4201
02:50:51,860 --> 02:50:52,920
Does that mean,
and we'd,

4202
02:50:52,930 --> 02:50:55,070
like I said,
we talked about an experiment earlier,

4203
02:50:55,071 --> 02:50:55,904
that we're an experiment.
What does it mean when people detach 

4204
02:50:57,891 --> 02:50:58,724
from that part of the human existence to
spend more time in this new part of 

4205
02:51:02,121 --> 02:51:03,470
human existence?
I don't know.

4206
02:51:03,530 --> 02:51:06,200
Well,
I think that part of being a person,

4207
02:51:06,201 --> 02:51:09,200
like being in nature is an,
it's part of us.

4208
02:51:09,470 --> 02:51:10,303
It's part of how we developed.
It's attached to our human reward 

4209
02:51:13,551 --> 02:51:14,384
system.
There's something that's deeply 

4210
02:51:15,081 --> 02:51:18,590
satisfying about lying down in a field 
and looking up at the stars.

4211
02:51:18,591 --> 02:51:22,130
And there's a reason for all that.
And the more we detach from that,

4212
02:51:22,131 --> 02:51:24,890
the more you're going to get these 
disenfranchised,

4213
02:51:24,891 --> 02:51:25,724
very unhappy people that feel like 
they're a prisoner or a slave to some 

4214
02:51:28,941 --> 02:51:30,740
system that doesn't give a fuck about 
them.

4215
02:51:30,741 --> 02:51:32,600
Cause it doesn't,
it really doesn't.

4216
02:51:32,810 --> 02:51:35,570
What the people that give a fuck about 
you or your community,

4217
02:51:35,690 --> 02:51:37,100
they're your friends.
The,

4218
02:51:37,101 --> 02:51:37,670
the,
the,

4219
02:51:37,670 --> 02:51:38,503
the community of likeminded humans that 
you've bonded with that share your 

4220
02:51:43,221 --> 02:51:48,221
occupation or share your interests.
And that's how people develop satisfying

4221
02:51:48,981 --> 02:51:50,870
relationships.
And satisfying lives.

4222
02:51:51,050 --> 02:51:56,050
The more you put yourself connected to 
something that doesn't even value you.

4223
02:51:56,270 --> 02:52:01,270
Some huge monolithic creation that's,
there's no one even running it.

4224
02:52:02,270 --> 02:52:06,640
It's not like some architect has figured
out a great to design civilization

4225
02:52:06,790 --> 02:52:08,880
to satisfy all the humans that are a 
part of it.

4226
02:52:08,890 --> 02:52:09,723
No,
you're feeding this machine and some 

4227
02:52:11,741 --> 02:52:15,610
sort of a weird way that nobody really 
understands the ramifications of because

4228
02:52:15,760 --> 02:52:19,450
we haven't done it before.
There hasn't been this global connection

4229
02:52:19,451 --> 02:52:23,080
of cell phones for thousands of years.
We know how to manage it.

4230
02:52:23,200 --> 02:52:25,360
We know how to manage your time and all 
your,

4231
02:52:25,510 --> 02:52:26,200
your,
your,

4232
02:52:26,200 --> 02:52:28,690
your emotions on social media now.
This is all,

4233
02:52:28,930 --> 02:52:29,763
this is all experimental.
It's all happening in the moment and 

4234
02:52:32,651 --> 02:52:33,484
we're all a part of it.
And what's it going to be like three 

4235
02:52:34,691 --> 02:52:36,970
generations from now?
I'm scared.

4236
02:52:37,060 --> 02:52:37,893
I'm scared that we're eliminating as 
much as possible boredom from our lives 

4237
02:52:41,670 --> 02:52:43,630
because I think the boredom is 
important.

4238
02:52:43,990 --> 02:52:44,950
Um,
when I was a kid,

4239
02:52:44,951 --> 02:52:47,230
we talked about being weird when I was a
kid,

4240
02:52:47,270 --> 02:52:49,180
um,
had a lot of free time on my hands.

4241
02:52:49,180 --> 02:52:51,940
Had to figure out ways to entertain 
myself,

4242
02:52:52,210 --> 02:52:54,040
no video games.
And you,

4243
02:52:54,070 --> 02:52:56,800
you,
you end up doing things that like,

4244
02:52:56,860 --> 02:52:57,551
um,
you know,

4245
02:52:57,551 --> 02:52:58,770
you had talked about your whole,
you know,

4246
02:52:58,990 --> 02:53:01,690
we found this niche for me and this 
history show thing cause it's what I was

4247
02:53:01,691 --> 02:53:03,160
born to do or whatever.
Yes.

4248
02:53:03,161 --> 02:53:03,994
But,
but it goes back to me trying to figure 

4249
02:53:05,711 --> 02:53:06,191
out,
okay,

4250
02:53:06,191 --> 02:53:08,260
I've played with these toy plastic 
soldiers,

4251
02:53:08,430 --> 02:53:09,460
uh,
every single day,

4252
02:53:09,461 --> 02:53:10,294
how do I make something new so that I 
can be entertained with these same toy 

4253
02:53:12,671 --> 02:53:13,504
soldier?
You know?

4254
02:53:13,950 --> 02:53:15,920
And I think that all,
you know,

4255
02:53:15,950 --> 02:53:18,790
if we think about building blocks in 
your brain,

4256
02:53:18,820 --> 02:53:21,580
the need to overcome boredom,
for example,

4257
02:53:21,760 --> 02:53:23,650
is a prime mover.
When you're young,

4258
02:53:23,651 --> 02:53:25,690
you're not motivated by money,
you're not motivate.

4259
02:53:25,750 --> 02:53:26,410
It's,
it's,

4260
02:53:26,410 --> 02:53:29,080
you're not even motivated by,
by the opposite sex.

4261
02:53:29,081 --> 02:53:29,861
You know,
when you're a kid,

4262
02:53:29,861 --> 02:53:30,694
you're like,
what am I going to do to fill this 

4263
02:53:32,290 --> 02:53:32,290
afternoon?

4264
02:53:32,290 --> 02:53:33,550
And you find ways to,
you know,

4265
02:53:33,551 --> 02:53:37,810
I remember tearing up my mom's garden 
wants to create a giant river system,

4266
02:53:37,811 --> 02:53:38,860
you know?
Yeah.

4267
02:53:39,800 --> 02:53:41,560
But would you do that today?
Was even bothered,

4268
02:53:41,561 --> 02:53:43,120
took hours.
I mean I would,

4269
02:53:43,150 --> 02:53:44,680
but maybe a kid would.
Maybe there's,

4270
02:53:44,681 --> 02:53:46,220
maybe there's an app where you can do 
it.

4271
02:53:46,240 --> 02:53:48,120
Do the,
do the same thing on my point is,

4272
02:53:48,121 --> 02:53:48,954
is that there's these sorts of prime 
movers end up creating their needs that 

4273
02:53:52,961 --> 02:53:55,930
create the need for solutions.
If you get rid of that need,

4274
02:53:56,110 --> 02:53:57,850
do you need the solution anymore?
And did,

4275
02:53:57,851 --> 02:53:58,684
did the,
did the need for the solution create a 

4276
02:54:00,201 --> 02:54:01,034
different Joe Rogan Dan Carlin or Joe 
blow out on the street then would have 

4277
02:54:04,091 --> 02:54:06,730
been otherwise we've talked about 
creating a more formidable human being,

4278
02:54:06,940 --> 02:54:11,800
having to overcome my childhood boredom 
created a more formidable human being.

4279
02:54:12,000 --> 02:54:14,920
It did Dan Carlin,
we just did three hours again,

4280
02:54:15,190 --> 02:54:16,330
just went flying by.

4281
02:54:16,360 --> 02:54:17,620
Always done.
It always does.

4282
02:54:17,800 --> 02:54:19,540
We got to do this more often.
We always say this,

4283
02:54:19,541 --> 02:54:21,820
but can we please,
I may.

4284
02:54:21,821 --> 02:54:23,380
I may do a book soon.
It was,

4285
02:54:23,381 --> 02:54:24,214
you'd like to have a stress stupid book 
tour interview and are you gonna do 

4286
02:54:26,351 --> 02:54:27,184
that?
I don't know.

4287
02:54:27,570 --> 02:54:29,620
Same,
same time the virtual reality comes out.

4288
02:54:30,010 --> 02:54:32,530
Let's please sit down and talk more 
often.

4289
02:54:32,531 --> 02:54:33,550
I'm really,
I really enjoy it.

4290
02:54:33,551 --> 02:54:34,384
Can I just tell you,
you're one of the most open minded 

4291
02:54:35,801 --> 02:54:36,634
people though,
and I do quote you at times because 

4292
02:54:37,781 --> 02:54:38,830
you've taught me a lot.
Oh,

4293
02:54:38,831 --> 02:54:40,360
thank you brother.
And you've taught me a lot too.

4294
02:54:40,450 --> 02:54:42,130
I appreciate it.
Dan Carlin,

4295
02:54:42,131 --> 02:54:43,690
ladies and gentlemen,
hardcore history.

4296
02:54:44,140 --> 02:54:45,430
Go download,
subscribe.

4297
02:54:45,700 --> 02:54:50,700
Bye.
You do know.
