00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:02,890
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:03,291
Hey,

3
00:00:03,291 --> 00:00:04,410
this is a quote from Ray Kurzweil,

4
00:00:04,411 --> 00:00:06,930
which is things aren't getting worse.

5
00:00:06,931 --> 00:00:08,460
Our information's getting better,

6
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:09,240
right?

7
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,230
And so with Hillary Clinton,

8
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,260
who is a career politician,

9
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,273
right?

10
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,070
And we've all known since we were young,

11
00:00:20,071 --> 00:00:20,701
most people,

12
00:00:20,701 --> 00:00:22,770
I think when they think about politicians,

13
00:00:22,771 --> 00:00:25,170
they don't think those
are some honest people.

14
00:00:25,171 --> 00:00:26,370
Those politicians,

15
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,200
they usually are telling the truth.

16
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,930
I think most of his think politicians,

17
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:32,003
they lie,

18
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:33,090
they warp things,

19
00:00:33,091 --> 00:00:34,350
they fabricate things,

20
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:39,560
they use a form of deception to gain
control of various power structures.

21
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,400
That's what the animal does.

22
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:46,550
So that's not new information when you
find out that Hillary Clinton and the

23
00:00:46,681 --> 00:00:47,610
DNC,

24
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:50,010
and I don't know if they
completely connected those two,

25
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:51,920
but when you find out that they,

26
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:52,770
they,

27
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:53,670
they were not,

28
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:55,530
they didn't do what
they're supposed to do.

29
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:00,860
They helped Hillary Clinton become the
Democratic nominee and they actively

30
00:01:01,051 --> 00:01:02,580
tried to fuck up Bernie Sanders.

31
00:01:02,581 --> 00:01:03,150
Right?

32
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:03,983
That's creepy.

33
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,210
But it's not a new thing.

34
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:06,571
I know,

35
00:01:06,571 --> 00:01:07,321
but it is creepy.

36
00:01:07,321 --> 00:01:08,160
It's creepy.

37
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:12,570
And it's even more creepy that the
woman who was in charge resigns and then

38
00:01:12,571 --> 00:01:13,500
immediately gets hired.

39
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:14,340
Great Shot.

40
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:14,611
Got It.

41
00:01:14,611 --> 00:01:15,090
Great job.

42
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:16,080
Hillary Clinton's like,

43
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:16,950
fuck it,

44
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,500
I'm going to hire you
and it won't do anything.

45
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:20,580
She hires her.

46
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:25,670
She's so fucking unafraid of what's going
to happen that she hires the woman who

47
00:01:26,401 --> 00:01:27,690
did such shitty thing,

48
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:28,020
she

49
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,210
had to resign booed off stage.

50
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,420
Hires her into her fucking
party cause she's like,

51
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,433
fuck you.

52
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,090
I'm getting elected.

53
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,740
Are Not stopping it.

54
00:01:37,741 --> 00:01:38,130
Right.

55
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:40,730
But this is again tech.

56
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:41,970
It's gangster too though.

57
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:46,020
It's also a move in on her part where,

58
00:01:46,021 --> 00:01:50,000
I mean she's looking at it like what
Trump is calling her crooked Hillary like

59
00:01:50,001 --> 00:01:50,190
yeah,

60
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:53,940
it's a gangster move to
hire a woman like that.

61
00:01:53,941 --> 00:01:54,930
Like right in front of you.

62
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:55,381
Yeah.

63
00:01:55,381 --> 00:02:00,330
Wasserman Schultz top post
mission accomplished the DNC.

64
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,171
This is,

65
00:02:01,171 --> 00:02:02,190
this is not a new,

66
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:03,990
this is not a new thing man.

67
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,160
This is what exactly,

68
00:02:05,161 --> 00:02:09,240
well let's go over this because what
exactly did they do that's so awful about

69
00:02:09,241 --> 00:02:09,901
Bernie Sanders?

70
00:02:09,901 --> 00:02:10,734
What did they do?

71
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,310
They apparently came up with a way to
disseminate information to the press,

72
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:18,510
highlighting certain aspects of Bernie
Sanders that would be unappealing to the

73
00:02:18,511 --> 00:02:19,010
voter

74
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:21,050
and they did this and this
has all been confirmed.

75
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:21,560
Can you,

76
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:21,951
can you,

77
00:02:21,951 --> 00:02:22,340
uh,

78
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,000
Google that?

79
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,230
Find out what they actually said.

80
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:24,921
Let's find out what the,

81
00:02:24,921 --> 00:02:28,670
actually summarize the Wiki if we think
they're being a bunch of whiny bitches,

82
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,130
but for sure they wanted him.

83
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:30,591
Look,

84
00:02:30,591 --> 00:02:33,440
she's got way deeper arms in politics.

85
00:02:33,441 --> 00:02:35,420
She's way more connected
than he is for sure.

86
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:35,810
There's,

87
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:36,860
and this is what we're seeing too,

88
00:02:36,861 --> 00:02:40,400
that it's like a big part of being a
political candidate is how many favors do

89
00:02:40,401 --> 00:02:41,030
you have?

90
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,770
How many people you are you connected to,

91
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:43,010
how,

92
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,720
how deep does your influence go?

93
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:45,260
Right.

94
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:50,210
And obviously her influence didn't just
sit within her are her own little group

95
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:53,270
of people that were working for
it had gotten to the DNC itself.

96
00:02:53,271 --> 00:02:54,020
So she's,

97
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,210
she's deeply embedded
in this whole system,

98
00:02:56,211 --> 00:02:59,950
whether it's because of friendships or
ideologies or people just wanted her,

99
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,210
she's the chosen one.

100
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:02,020
Whatever reason,

101
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,910
whatever deals were made or whoever,

102
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,140
who knows who knows what it is.

103
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,590
But when you find out that an organization
that's supposed to be the head,

104
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,521
it's supposed to be,

105
00:03:09,521 --> 00:03:09,970
if we,

106
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:12,190
if everything was on the up and up,

107
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:15,760
it's supposed to be objective and looking
for what the people want as the best

108
00:03:15,761 --> 00:03:16,180
party,

109
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,210
but now they're actually
actively steering it,

110
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:22,900
which is massively corrupt and kind of
scary is that these people are deciding

111
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:24,580
to steer an entire party,

112
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:28,300
which is 50% of a political
process because there's no,

113
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:28,990
look,

114
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:29,190
you've,

115
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:32,080
we've got libertarian party for the first
time people are taking Gary Johnson.

116
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:32,481
Seriously,

117
00:03:32,481 --> 00:03:33,190
it's going to do that.

118
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:33,600
Um,

119
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,240
um,

120
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,090
a town hall debate on
Wednesday or town hall,

121
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:39,430
one of those town hall
things on Wednesday on CNN,

122
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:43,330
but for the most part it's Democrats
or Republicans in most people's eyes.

123
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:47,590
So would there essentially doing
is rigging half of that process?

124
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,040
Yup.

125
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,780
That's Carrie that we just,

126
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,490
we don't think anything's wrong with that,

127
00:03:51,491 --> 00:03:55,720
but we put Martha Stewart in jail for
not telling exactly the truth about where

128
00:03:55,721 --> 00:03:58,950
she bought and sold stocks or
whatever the fuck she lied about.

129
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,630
We do that

130
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,250
think something's wrong about it,

131
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,650
but we can't do anything about it.

132
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,180
We do think something's wrong,

133
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,133
but right now,

134
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:06,891
but okay,

135
00:04:06,891 --> 00:04:11,891
so if like that institution is corrupt
and if the Republican institution is in

136
00:04:12,261 --> 00:04:13,430
some ways corrupt,

137
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,130
I think it might be safe to say,

138
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:20,810
and I don't think too many people would
be outraged at the idea that there is a

139
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:26,590
institutionalized corruption in the
entire American political system and it's

140
00:04:27,321 --> 00:04:30,500
very similar to the problem
that happens in bike racing.

141
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:35,770
If one motherfucker rigs their bike or
gets on fucking doping stuff that can't

142
00:04:36,201 --> 00:04:37,034
be detected.

143
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,170
If you want to have a fair advantage,

144
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:42,290
you've got a rig your
bike and start doping to,

145
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:45,020
or the person who rigs
their bike will always win.

146
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:48,080
So if politics is a competition,

147
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,490
which it clearly is,

148
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:54,670
and if members of the competition are
using nefarious means to achieve their

149
00:04:55,131 --> 00:04:55,641
goals,

150
00:04:55,641 --> 00:04:56,600
which they clearly are,

151
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,830
which they clearly are,

152
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:01,370
then that would imply that if you
wanted to survive in that system,

153
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:05,720
you would also have to
use nefarious means dom,

154
00:05:05,721 --> 00:05:06,554
dom.

155
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,053
Wow,

156
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,540
this is not new.

157
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,130
This is old,

158
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:12,940
old,

159
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:13,661
old shit.

160
00:05:13,661 --> 00:05:16,360
What's new is technology.

161
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:21,510
What's new is now people like Julian
Assan change are shining a light on the

162
00:05:22,511 --> 00:05:24,460
corruption in his whole ideas.

163
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,410
If I reveal this information,

164
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:31,650
it will force reform via the outrage
of the people who are supposed to be

165
00:05:32,951 --> 00:05:35,590
represented by a person
who's breaking the law.

166
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,760
That's his idea.

167
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,080
We need reform.

168
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:42,280
And right now we're at the point where
it's very similar to when you're in a

169
00:05:42,281 --> 00:05:44,890
family and this is one of the
worst things can fucking happen,

170
00:05:44,891 --> 00:05:45,580
man.

171
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,510
In a family.

172
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,510
If there is somebody
who's molesting somebody,

173
00:05:49,511 --> 00:05:51,110
it happens all the time where uh,

174
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:51,610
uh,

175
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:53,260
a father or a brother,

176
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,290
we'll start fucking molesting somebody,

177
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:56,800
right?

178
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,090
But in people in the family know it,

179
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:01,880
but they don't do anything about it.

180
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:07,030
Because to talk about what GRANDPA does
every couple of years means the complete

181
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:11,060
disintegration of the fucking family,

182
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:13,610
an apocalypse for the family.

183
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:17,210
And the same way is more of
these revelations become clear,

184
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,320
which we always knew.

185
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,900
But you could always float
into a happy place and be like,

186
00:06:20,901 --> 00:06:21,530
Nah,

187
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:23,210
I'm just being a conspiracy dude.

188
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:28,250
I'm sure the stuff they're doing up on
Capitol Hill is all fair and square.

189
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:28,670
I,

190
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:28,911
you know,

191
00:06:28,911 --> 00:06:32,510
you can just pretend to
believe it now it's like,

192
00:06:32,511 --> 00:06:33,980
well now you're wrong.

193
00:06:33,981 --> 00:06:34,340
Look,

194
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:34,700
hey,

195
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,880
here's the fucking proof and here's going
to be more proof and there's going to

196
00:06:37,881 --> 00:06:42,080
be more proof and there's going to be
more proof until finally the American

197
00:06:42,081 --> 00:06:44,570
people are going to have
to either just be like,

198
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:50,720
I'm just going to believe that fours
three and three is four because I have a

199
00:06:50,721 --> 00:06:54,920
nice comfortable life and I don't
want to fucking deal with this shit,

200
00:06:54,921 --> 00:06:55,580
man.

201
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:58,460
I'm just going to trust the
banks because the banks lie.

202
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,300
They like money at my job
and as long as I keep my job,

203
00:07:02,301 --> 00:07:03,380
I'll keep my benefits.

204
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:03,920
Yeah,

205
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,880
and by the way,

206
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:05,511
ps,

207
00:07:05,511 --> 00:07:06,230
man,

208
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,340
when you consider that,

209
00:07:07,341 --> 00:07:10,370
it's like there's something
pragmatic about that.

210
00:07:10,371 --> 00:07:12,160
As sad as it is theirs,

211
00:07:12,161 --> 00:07:12,341
as,

212
00:07:12,341 --> 00:07:12,920
as,

213
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,641
as depressing.

214
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:14,040
It is.

215
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,451
It is.

216
00:07:14,451 --> 00:07:19,451
But they're the real awful
problem is that this country,

217
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:25,520
I think is that they get metaphysical
machine that was built by some very

218
00:07:25,521 --> 00:07:30,260
intelligent people who understood the
energy flow that comes through a society

219
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,250
and the elections were supposed to be
an outlet valve for the pressure that

220
00:07:34,251 --> 00:07:37,130
builds up when people feel
that they're being repressed,

221
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:37,880
right.

222
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:42,880
And if you start fucking with that output
valve by putting up fake politicians

223
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:47,540
that don't truly represent the people and
hope that the people will believe that

224
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:49,010
they have elected these people,

225
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:53,240
if you put two shitty choices in front
of us and we're supposed to look at that

226
00:07:53,241 --> 00:07:53,580
and be like,

227
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,413
okay,

228
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:55,820
everything's fine,

229
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:57,110
then you're,

230
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:58,790
you're missing the point,

231
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,840
which is that there is an energetic
system that needs to get released.

232
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,070
You know,

233
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:06,080
at some point the energy's got to go out.

234
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,310
If it doesn't go out,

235
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,480
you get revolution.

236
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:11,690
That's what the way the
energy goes out the wrong way.

237
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,200
The idea is let's fucking
the American revolution,

238
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:16,130
brutal,

239
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:16,850
bloody,

240
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:19,460
awful fucked these geniuses.

241
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:22,310
Many of them Freemasons got
together and they were like,

242
00:08:22,311 --> 00:08:23,144
you know what?

243
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:28,010
Is there a way that we can program
history so that a society doesn't destroy

244
00:08:28,011 --> 00:08:31,070
itself intermittently
with a fucking revolution?

245
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,360
Because if we could do that,

246
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:37,570
we'll build one of the most powerful
never ending societies on earth because we

247
00:08:37,641 --> 00:08:41,540
figured out a way to outflow
the pressure that builds up.

248
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:45,260
So when you start fucking with a goddamn
political system and pretend that

249
00:08:45,261 --> 00:08:46,610
everything's gonna be okay,

250
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,170
you are missing,

251
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:52,760
I think the the point which is
that people who are very smart,

252
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:57,910
maybe a lot smarter than
then the politicians we have
today recognize something,

253
00:08:58,290 --> 00:08:59,820
built a thing and said,

254
00:08:59,821 --> 00:09:01,440
let's just trust the fucking people.

255
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:04,990
Let's trust the people release
the steam and while ah,

256
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,560
everything runs according to plan.

257
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:10,980
Now the gears are a little
fucking gummed up man.

258
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:11,880
A little,

259
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,713
yeah,

260
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:14,580
a little how gummed up,

261
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,080
how gummed up the gears
are really crazy comes up.

262
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:23,060
This is the first time we're realizing
how much money people make by running for

263
00:09:23,061 --> 00:09:23,894
president.

264
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,531
How much,

265
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:24,771
you know,

266
00:09:24,771 --> 00:09:26,420
money costs to run for president.

267
00:09:26,421 --> 00:09:31,421
But how much money top political figures
make and donations and in speeches have

268
00:09:31,551 --> 00:09:31,731
you,

269
00:09:31,731 --> 00:09:34,760
have you paid attention to how much they
make in speeches like Rudy Giuliani and

270
00:09:34,761 --> 00:09:37,670
Hillary Clinton and
Bill Clinton may bribes?

271
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:38,150
Well,

272
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,020
this is what it is.

273
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:43,910
These corporations can fund various,

274
00:09:43,911 --> 00:09:44,091
uh,

275
00:09:44,091 --> 00:09:45,020
universities.

276
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:49,640
They can donate money to have all sorts
of different programs where they would

277
00:09:49,641 --> 00:09:53,720
have someone speak and they can decide
who gets to speak and who doesn't get to

278
00:09:53,721 --> 00:09:54,320
speak.

279
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,540
And they also have like
the Clinton Foundation,

280
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,400
people donate money into that.

281
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,180
They don't donate to sh fuck loads
of now it's all these things,

282
00:10:02,181 --> 00:10:05,270
but hold on a second says all these
things with what they are essentially.

283
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:05,601
Or you're,

284
00:10:05,601 --> 00:10:10,010
you're paying someone to speak for an
hour and you're going to give him $750,000

285
00:10:10,011 --> 00:10:11,570
and you want me to pretend
that that's normal.

286
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,130
That's crazy.

287
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,420
And what does this person do?

288
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,620
They are a public servant.

289
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:16,820
Okay.

290
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:17,061
Okay.

291
00:10:17,061 --> 00:10:19,550
So there are public servant and
while they're publicly serving,

292
00:10:19,551 --> 00:10:23,480
they're also making $750,000 to talk.

293
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,410
Yeah,

294
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:25,670
that seems a little crazy,

295
00:10:25,671 --> 00:10:26,360
doesn't it?

296
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:26,541
Like,

297
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:29,840
why do they make so much money to do that
and who was paying them and what what,

298
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:34,490
what do you have to benefit by having
them come and read some nonsense,

299
00:10:34,491 --> 00:10:35,400
bullshit,

300
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,800
boring speech.

301
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,860
A friend of mine went to see Rudy Giuliani
after post nine one one when he was

302
00:10:39,861 --> 00:10:40,820
on his victory tour.

303
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:43,400
He was on like a lap of
the country doing these,

304
00:10:43,401 --> 00:10:46,310
these speeches because everybody loved
him because he's saved the world.

305
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:49,540
During September 11th he was
the guy who stood strong,

306
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,271
everybody like,

307
00:10:50,271 --> 00:10:50,601
wow,

308
00:10:50,601 --> 00:10:51,151
Rudy Giuliani,

309
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:51,531
he's a good man.

310
00:10:51,531 --> 00:10:54,290
So he wrote that and he started doing
these speeches and he'd come to colleges

311
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:58,910
and a friend of mine went to see him
and said it was dog shit that he just,

312
00:10:58,911 --> 00:11:03,440
it was a boring ass like
reading with no passion.

313
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:07,820
It was a chick chain go in there and
say some nonsense about freedom and the

314
00:11:07,821 --> 00:11:12,590
American way and terrorism or whatever
the fuck and first responders and just

315
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:12,900
there.

316
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,420
There wasn't anything real.

317
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:15,050
It was just,

318
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,130
it was a performance.

319
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:20,270
It was like he was doing a one man show
all across the country for exorbitant

320
00:11:20,271 --> 00:11:21,104
sums of money.

321
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:21,981
God,

322
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:24,920
that'd be fucking great if he was
actually doing a one man show,

323
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:29,950
hundred and $53 million in bill and
Hillary Clinton speaking fees documented.

324
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:31,641
This is just,

325
00:11:31,641 --> 00:11:32,720
Jamie just pulled this up.

326
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:36,290
That that is stunning.

327
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:40,500
That's a s dunning amount
of money and whatever,

328
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,211
15 years.

329
00:11:41,211 --> 00:11:44,540
It's from 2001 to about now it's it still,

330
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:45,171
it's more than,

331
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:45,590
yeah,

332
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:46,480
that's mean.

333
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:46,760
Well,

334
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,740
it's perfect then because
that's $10 million a year.

335
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,040
This is more recent of which shit,

336
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,050
2100 25,000 that's our standard fee.

337
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,573
Oh my God.

338
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:02,350
She prefers a private jet and prefers
a Gulfstream four 50 or larger.

339
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,070
The memo outlines at Clinton
requires travel by private jet.

340
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,280
Yeah.

341
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:07,531
You know,

342
00:12:07,531 --> 00:12:08,640
it'd be fucking cold out.

343
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,391
Is this like,

344
00:12:09,391 --> 00:12:11,310
what if you are like a mad billionaire?

345
00:12:11,311 --> 00:12:14,880
Could you just get Hillary Clinton to
come to your house and like just speak to

346
00:12:14,881 --> 00:12:16,650
you for an hour and your living room?

347
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,880
This is fascinating.

348
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:20,301
Hold up,

349
00:12:20,301 --> 00:12:21,310
but scroll back down there.

350
00:12:21,311 --> 00:12:23,020
She may $21 million to and what?

351
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:26,770
She made 21 point $6 million in
speeches and just under two years.

352
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:29,423
That's amazing.

353
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,650
That's incredible.

354
00:12:31,651 --> 00:12:32,910
That's so much money.

355
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:37,740
She's like a kind of like crazy animal
that you can like lure with money.

356
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:38,700
Like you can actually,

357
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,430
if you have enough money
you can learn again,

358
00:12:41,431 --> 00:12:42,810
Hillary Clinton into your house.

359
00:12:42,811 --> 00:12:44,100
Like you just have to lay it out.

360
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:44,941
She'll show up.

361
00:12:44,941 --> 00:12:46,590
Like if I put carrots in my backyard,

362
00:12:46,591 --> 00:12:47,850
I'll probably get a rabbit or two.

363
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,110
If you have enough money,

364
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,610
you can get politicians to come
and start feeding it your mansion.

365
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:53,950
When does it become,

366
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:55,260
when does it become bribe?

367
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:55,661
Okay,

368
00:12:55,661 --> 00:12:57,640
so should she like say,

369
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:57,881
well,

370
00:12:57,881 --> 00:12:58,900
you can never be,

371
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,120
it's weird,

372
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:01,450
right?

373
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:06,450
You couldn't be someone who is in public
office and go and also have like a,

374
00:13:06,731 --> 00:13:11,731
a book reading tour where you read from
your novel about crime or something like

375
00:13:11,771 --> 00:13:11,951
that.

376
00:13:11,951 --> 00:13:16,320
You'd have to be like a no
fiction person who's we?

377
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:17,230
When you're talking,

378
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:19,210
you're talking about what you do for work.

379
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,680
That's part of what you're talking about.

380
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:20,951
Like,

381
00:13:20,951 --> 00:13:24,910
nobody's gonna re ask Hillary Clinton
to come and speak about the history of

382
00:13:24,911 --> 00:13:26,110
jazz in the United States.

383
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:26,591
Right.

384
00:13:26,591 --> 00:13:28,000
She's not going to give speeches on that.

385
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:29,740
It's going to give speeches on politics.

386
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,633
Right,

387
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:31,250
right,

388
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:31,570
right.

389
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:31,751
So,

390
00:13:31,751 --> 00:13:32,320
okay,

391
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,030
so why is that okay.

392
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,800
Why can you like have two jobs?

393
00:13:35,801 --> 00:13:37,300
That means you're having a second job.

394
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:38,590
Like you're doing your job.

395
00:13:38,591 --> 00:13:39,250
Like you're,

396
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,500
you're saying the things
that you say during your job,

397
00:13:41,501 --> 00:13:42,910
but somebody else is paying you to,

398
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,470
why is it okay that,

399
00:13:44,471 --> 00:13:45,490
why is it okay to do that?

400
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:45,790
Like,

401
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:48,940
that seems like that's like,

402
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,380
that seems like very problematic.

403
00:13:50,381 --> 00:13:51,214
Right?

404
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,850
Why is it okay for your
husband to go talk?

405
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:58,060
Who was he talked to you that the
head of the whoever the prosecutor,

406
00:13:58,061 --> 00:14:01,930
who was he to district his Bill Clinton
went and had this secret meeting with

407
00:14:01,931 --> 00:14:02,680
what's his,

408
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,513
who was it?

409
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:04,913
What about what?

410
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:05,390
Well,

411
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:06,040
right.

412
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:06,640
Oh,

413
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:06,881
right,

414
00:14:06,881 --> 00:14:07,031
right,

415
00:14:07,031 --> 00:14:07,330
right.

416
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:07,540
Uh,

417
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,620
Lindsey,

418
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:10,023
what the hell is her name?

419
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:13,421
I've had it.

420
00:14:13,421 --> 00:14:14,254
I lost it.

421
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:14,940
Dammit.

422
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:18,570
The point is like you just
are openly like hiring,

423
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:19,530
hiring the,

424
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:20,090
the,

425
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:25,090
the woman who somehow warped the process
of getting a Democratic nominee there.

426
00:14:26,731 --> 00:14:27,210
Yeah.

427
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:28,043
What's her name?

428
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:28,800
Loretta.

429
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,820
Loretta Lynch.

430
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:30,470
Yeah.

431
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,800
Doesn't that sound like a country singer?

432
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,310
Is that uh,

433
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:32,611
yeah.

434
00:14:32,611 --> 00:14:33,250
That's fine.

435
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,081
We're gonna land first.

436
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:34,291
I was like,

437
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:34,381
oh,

438
00:14:34,381 --> 00:14:34,831
that's isn't right.

439
00:14:34,831 --> 00:14:35,071
Yeah.

440
00:14:35,071 --> 00:14:35,701
Loretta Lynn,

441
00:14:35,701 --> 00:14:35,941
right.

442
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:36,691
That's what it sounds like.

443
00:14:36,691 --> 00:14:37,500
Loretta Lynch.

444
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,080
Yeah.

445
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:41,820
Now she met Bill Clinton meets with the
attorney general on an Arizona Tarmac

446
00:14:41,821 --> 00:14:42,211
now list,

447
00:14:42,211 --> 00:14:42,570
by the way,

448
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:45,810
flew in on his private
plane and said that he,

449
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,010
it was impromptu.

450
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:51,210
Who Love Fuck flat and
prompt to on a private.

451
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,713
Yeah.

452
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:53,171
Hey,

453
00:14:53,171 --> 00:14:54,004
you know what?

454
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:54,760
Hey,

455
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,560
who are we flying over right now?

456
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:57,580
He's one of us.

457
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:57,851
Wait,

458
00:14:57,851 --> 00:14:58,661
are we flying over?

459
00:14:58,661 --> 00:14:59,470
Loretta Lynch.

460
00:14:59,470 --> 00:14:59,681
Oh,

461
00:14:59,681 --> 00:15:00,071
come on,

462
00:15:00,071 --> 00:15:00,621
stop down.

463
00:15:00,621 --> 00:15:01,960
I'm going to get a piece of Apple Pie.

464
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:03,450
She's a good one.

465
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:05,740
We're going to sit on the
porch and drink lemonade.

466
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,570
Talk about our grandchildren on the porch,

467
00:15:07,571 --> 00:15:08,410
on the tarmac.

468
00:15:08,411 --> 00:15:09,850
Nothing I love more than a nice,

469
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:12,940
a nice picnic on the tarmac of an airport.

470
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:13,211
Well,

471
00:15:13,211 --> 00:15:13,710
this is the other

472
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:17,730
saying that she lied about being dead
broke after leaving the White House.

473
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:18,390
Right.

474
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:19,290
Not only dead broke,

475
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:19,831
but in debt.

476
00:15:19,831 --> 00:15:21,660
She said that apparently the system,

477
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,010
so not true.

478
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:24,571
Yeah.

479
00:15:24,571 --> 00:15:26,190
And now and now it's like t tea.

480
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,570
To make matters worse,

481
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,020
it's like you have to it.

482
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:32,460
There's this weird idea that's like,

483
00:15:32,461 --> 00:15:33,294
listen,

484
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,970
you might not like
Hillary fucking Clinton.

485
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,230
Can you go back to that real quick?

486
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:37,590
Yeah,

487
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:38,220
but they're like,

488
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:43,110
you better shut the fuck up about her
because do you want Trump to be president

489
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:43,590
daddy's?

490
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:44,071
What's going on?

491
00:15:44,071 --> 00:15:44,310
Right?

492
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:44,581
Yeah.

493
00:15:44,581 --> 00:15:45,330
So good.

494
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:45,751
It says here,

495
00:15:45,751 --> 00:15:46,230
this is what,

496
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,460
this is where it's confusing.

497
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,031
It says,

498
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:51,720
when Hillary filed a financial disclosure
document after entering in the Senate

499
00:15:51,721 --> 00:15:56,550
in 2001 she reported assets of less
than 1.8 million in liabilities are more

500
00:15:56,551 --> 00:15:57,384
than 2 million.

501
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:57,691
Well,

502
00:15:57,691 --> 00:15:58,410
where are they doing?

503
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:01,530
What were they doing with all
the money he's spending money on?

504
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,820
There's like,

505
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:03,810
who the fuck?

506
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,560
Okay,

507
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:09,560
who has like $2 million in
assets and in $2 million in debt?

508
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,550
Do you have $2 million in debt?

509
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,060
No.

510
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:14,400
Most people don't have $2 million in debt.

511
00:16:14,401 --> 00:16:14,630
That's,

512
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:15,990
that's a crazy amount of money.

513
00:16:15,991 --> 00:16:16,530
Like,

514
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:17,910
did you guys have a budget?

515
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,930
You're dead broke now.

516
00:16:18,931 --> 00:16:19,830
You guys are crazy.

517
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,800
He party and you guys do a
blow and buying Ferrari's.

518
00:16:22,801 --> 00:16:24,630
Just staying on a Amazon lady.

519
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:29,430
Who the fuck gets $2 million
in the hole like that?

520
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:31,140
Dan is like,

521
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:34,050
if you want it to have someone that
you wanted to balance the budget,

522
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:37,200
wouldn't you pick the person that
doesn't get 2 million in the hole?

523
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:38,220
I mean,

524
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,120
no man,

525
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:42,690
it tracks Trump's been
bankrupt a gang at times too,

526
00:16:42,691 --> 00:16:42,990
right?

527
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:43,520
How's he been

528
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,271
bankrupt a few times?

529
00:16:44,271 --> 00:16:44,510
Yep.

530
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:45,440
That's what they say.

531
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,150
He says he likes going bankrupt.

532
00:16:47,151 --> 00:16:48,740
It's somehow part of some plan.

533
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:51,350
But now the question,

534
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,360
what about the shit about Saudi Arabia?

535
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,343
What is this?

536
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:55,221
You don't remember this?

537
00:16:55,221 --> 00:16:57,920
I remember when it was like Saturday
night live was making jokes about them

538
00:16:57,921 --> 00:16:59,300
stealing like uh,

539
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:02,860
like silverware and fine
China and stuff from it.

540
00:17:02,861 --> 00:17:05,810
When they were like leaving
like on their last day,

541
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,640
what year was this?

542
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:11,540
Was like two and from 2000 like when
they were literally living in the bushes

543
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:12,230
were coming in.

544
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:12,910
Oh my God.

545
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:16,370
Taking all sorts of extra artwork
and all clocks and kinds of things.

546
00:17:16,371 --> 00:17:17,300
And I don't know if it's true,

547
00:17:17,301 --> 00:17:18,290
but it's,

548
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:18,770
it's,

549
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:20,090
I don't think the meme has gone away.

550
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:20,811
I don't know,

551
00:17:20,811 --> 00:17:21,644
man.

552
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:22,843
Ha.

553
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,900
That's hilarious.

554
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:25,610
She's so gangster.

555
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:26,420
Pardon me?

556
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,253
Look,

557
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:28,110
I,

558
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:30,530
I kind of appreciate it in a way.

559
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,690
She's like our Putin.

560
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,673
Uh Huh.

561
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:33,800
Yeah.

562
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,633
Great.

563
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:35,541
Great.

564
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:36,350
Just what we need.

565
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:38,840
[inaudible] part of me
appreciates how gangster she is.

566
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:46,200
Okay.
