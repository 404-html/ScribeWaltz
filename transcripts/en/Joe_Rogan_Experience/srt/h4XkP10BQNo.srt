1
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:07,370
Boom, and we're alive. Kevin Lee. Yes.

2
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:10,910
It's about as fresh off of a fight
as you can get, man. Yeah, just about

3
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:17,140
barely slept. Yeah. It must've
been a crazy, first of all,

4
00:00:17,141 --> 00:00:21,040
like after a fight it's probably you
probably so wired and like can't believe

5
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:24,820
it's over. Right. What does it like? It
takes you a minute for it to hit you.

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,540
Really? Uh, I didn't sleep at
all after the fight. I just,

7
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:34,020
I laid there for a little bit. Mind kind
of racing, didn't really settle down. Uh,

8
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,010
I just ended up just getting up,

9
00:00:36,011 --> 00:00:38,680
getting some breakfast and then
a right on the plane over here.

10
00:00:38,681 --> 00:00:42,850
Densely ball and on playing came over
here. Three Aum. I'd been up all morning.

11
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:46,220
But you, what do you like 25? Yeah.
Yeah. Keep going. Yeah, keep going.

12
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:49,240
Rockstar lifestyle, baby.
I've got to live it at 25.

13
00:00:49,241 --> 00:00:52,640
You can do that for like two days in a
row before it really starts to settle it.

14
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:55,690
Yeah. No, I'll be good for a minute. I
mean, besides getting kicked in the head,

15
00:00:55,691 --> 00:00:59,530
I'm all good. Other than that did that,
that was the, first of all, it was a very,

16
00:00:59,531 --> 00:01:01,420
very, very impressive performance. I mean,

17
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:06,340
Edson Barboza is no fucking joke and
notoriously difficult to take down.

18
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:09,760
Even Khabib struggled getting him down
the early parts of the first round,

19
00:01:09,761 --> 00:01:13,090
but you got them down quick. Yeah. I
think a lot of people underestimate that,

20
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,440
especially how technical my
wrestling can get. Um, I,

21
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:22,030
I just feel like Edison was really strong.
Uh,

22
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:26,820
he was probably the strongest guy that
I've ever faced. Physically. It just,

23
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:29,200
his body is just,
it moved a little bit different,

24
00:01:29,201 --> 00:01:31,980
but technically I just had to
the aspect there. And when,

25
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:35,500
when you add those two things up, I'm
equally as strong, you know? Yeah.

26
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,790
I'm just going to blow him off the water.
Well,

27
00:01:36,791 --> 00:01:41,260
he's just a bundle of fast twitch
muscle fiber, man. That dude,

28
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,210
I mean, people, you know,

29
00:01:43,211 --> 00:01:45,190
they'll see the cubby fight and
they'll see this fight with you.

30
00:01:45,191 --> 00:01:48,850
They might not understand how good that
guy really is. He's very, very good.

31
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,090
He's obese and he's going to come back
and he's going to knock some people out.

32
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:56,200
He's only gonna get better from here.
I think it's just he,

33
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,400
it's the styles make the fights too in me.
I feel like I can fight any style,

34
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:03,130
you know, that that was my number
one goal when I got into this sport,

35
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:06,840
just to be the most well rounded,
complete fighter that there is an,

36
00:02:06,841 --> 00:02:11,841
and I feel like I can take advantage of
some of his things that he's not good

37
00:02:12,301 --> 00:02:14,380
and good at, but he's going to
get better at him. He's going to,

38
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:15,520
he's going to be back.
He's a beast.

39
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:19,510
Well that focus in that mindset of being
well rounded was very obvious in that

40
00:02:19,511 --> 00:02:21,520
fight.
I was very impressed by the fact you,

41
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:25,630
you fight just as good south southpaw as
you do orthodox, you switch up easily.

42
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:29,440
I've, I've been, uh, I've only been
going south for maybe the past year,

43
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:33,880
year and a half or so, uh, and just
kind of getting a filler for a down.

44
00:02:33,881 --> 00:02:35,350
But I feel like that could be one of the,

45
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:38,770
when you listen to a lot of the
great fighters in, in the past,

46
00:02:38,771 --> 00:02:40,600
they talk about a right hand,
a softball.

47
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:44,080
There's so many advantages they
can be there. Uh, and it's just,

48
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:46,770
it's just always great to be able
to switch up and change timings,

49
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:49,980
especially when you've got a god that's,
that's trying to time you like Edson, uh,

50
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,490
because he say that,
I'm sorry,

51
00:02:51,491 --> 00:02:53,830
but they say that if you
work on the opposite side,

52
00:02:53,831 --> 00:02:55,690
it actually makes the other
side better. Yeah. Yeah.

53
00:02:55,691 --> 00:02:58,720
It makes it a little bit easier when
you switch back. And I've noticed that,

54
00:02:58,721 --> 00:03:00,130
I mean, still some, some

55
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:03,250
kinks and twist that I want to kind of
get out of there. You know what you see,

56
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:08,490
I study a lot of people. I study a lot of
switch fighters, especially in MMA. Uh,

57
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,440
recently,
I want to say about the last two years.

58
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:14,680
He hasn't been doing it more often,
but some guys do it better than others.

59
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:17,050
I try to get the perfect mix,
you know?

60
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:21,150
Well, some guys do it, but there's a
twist, right? Like wonder boy does it.

61
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,340
But when Wonderboy does it, you know that
the front leg is coming and then he's,

62
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:29,400
you know, he's, he can fight any style.
I mean he could fight left or right,

63
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:31,560
but when he switches,
when he goes right,

64
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,380
you know that front leg side kicks coming,

65
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:36,810
that front leg roundhouse kick is
coming and then when he stands Orthodox,

66
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,440
he's much more likely to throw a
punch or you know, maybe even spin,

67
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,660
he mixes it up.
But he,

68
00:03:42,661 --> 00:03:45,870
he's limited maybe in the way he attacks

69
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:47,060
blending of it.

70
00:03:47,061 --> 00:03:51,860
I think Wonderboy is one of those guys
that his switches are like really, uh,

71
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:55,670
you could see him coming, you know, he,
he makes them really pronounced, you know,

72
00:03:55,671 --> 00:03:58,870
they're big switches and you know,
the, the attacks that are coming,

73
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:02,090
there are certain guys like Tj
Dillashaw who was great at mixing it up

74
00:04:02,091 --> 00:04:06,770
completely. I feel like he doesn't sit
down on his punches too much or, you know,

75
00:04:06,771 --> 00:04:10,340
he gets in spots where he can get clip
and between those with your feet off the

76
00:04:10,341 --> 00:04:13,160
ground. So I tried to find the
happy medium between those two,

77
00:04:13,161 --> 00:04:17,070
switching up too much and uh, being
able to make those hard switches too.

78
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,400
Teachers really been doing that style
for just like three or four years now

79
00:04:20,401 --> 00:04:23,820
since he's been with bang. Maybe it
was about, I want to say three years,

80
00:04:23,821 --> 00:04:24,240
four years.

81
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,030
Yeah. Probably some of that. It
takes some time to get used to it,

82
00:04:27,031 --> 00:04:29,460
get used to the time in and everything.
And, and that's one of the things with me,

83
00:04:29,461 --> 00:04:33,090
like I try and beat the most consistent
a guy that there is out there.

84
00:04:33,091 --> 00:04:34,770
So the more consistently
I'm getting in there,

85
00:04:34,771 --> 00:04:39,020
the more I'm seeing things come in. Um,
um, um, reading the angles and, you know,

86
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:42,060
getting a lot of different looks, a lot
of different bodies being thrown at me.

87
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:45,830
Uh, so all that adds up to
experience and you know,

88
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,130
it's only gonna get better from there.

89
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:50,050
Yeah. It's also one of those things
when you're 25 years old, you,

90
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:54,450
you still are like realistically five
years away from your athletic prime.

91
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:58,510
Yeah. I kept that. I keep that in the back
of my mind sometimes because you know,

92
00:04:58,511 --> 00:05:00,490
you obviously don't want to
overwork the body too much.

93
00:05:00,491 --> 00:05:04,750
You don't want to burn out. Uh, but
I think it's just staying consistent,

94
00:05:04,751 --> 00:05:07,090
is staying healthy as long as
I'm healthy through it. You know,

95
00:05:07,091 --> 00:05:10,730
I got through that fight. No,
no serious damages at all. Uh,

96
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,920
and that's the most important thing is
just staying healthy when I'm young. Uh,

97
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,010
and uh,
you know,

98
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:17,710
tail him back when I'm starting to
get more damages are more injuries,

99
00:05:17,711 --> 00:05:21,310
but I do a great job with keeping my
body all the, I think more than anything.

100
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,470
What do you like when you were in,

101
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,120
I know Robert Follis was your
coach for quite a long time and uh,

102
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,190
we both miss him. I'm sure you,
you were very close with him.

103
00:05:30,191 --> 00:05:33,400
He was such a great guy. Yeah.
Yeah. Was he the guy that,

104
00:05:33,401 --> 00:05:37,300
like did he sort of map out your training
program when you were in camp or,

105
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,140
you know, I had, uh, we,
we kind of structured it,

106
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,820
or at least I try and structure it
like a full team, uh, aspect. You know,

107
00:05:44,821 --> 00:05:48,150
rob was kind of like, I think of
it like a race car, you know, I'm,

108
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:52,260
I'm the race car itself. Uh, but Robert
was like the hit driver, you know,

109
00:05:52,261 --> 00:05:55,880
rob is telling me where to go, what to do
a Dewey was kind of like my horsepower,

110
00:05:56,030 --> 00:06:00,300
you know, he's, yeah. Do
Cooper, uh, phenomenal striking
coach. If you ever, you know,

111
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,580
task fighter with him. He,
he was a smaller heavyweight,

112
00:06:04,581 --> 00:06:08,330
but he would fight giant guys like
Peter Arts and a dude that you got to,

113
00:06:08,331 --> 00:06:12,050
you know, you look at him, he's
only about two 26 foot one.

114
00:06:12,051 --> 00:06:15,110
Maybe he's fighting six
foot, seven, 300 pound guys.

115
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:19,610
So he has to be extra technical in there.
Uh, not rely on his speed and power.

116
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,580
That's why I think he,

117
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,440
he makes such a great coaching
and he pushes me through it.

118
00:06:24,441 --> 00:06:25,640
But I had another guy,

119
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:28,550
I've been working with Cory Goodwin for
the last four or five years since I've

120
00:06:28,551 --> 00:06:31,400
been on Vegas. He's kind of like
the mechanic, you know, he keeps me,

121
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:34,390
he keeps my body fresh and going is he,
or strength and conditioning,

122
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:39,370
but we call it that.
But what we do is a lot different than,

123
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:42,380
than strength and condition. And,
you know, it's, it's not a lot of,

124
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:45,850
I don't lift any weights and people
when people are seating. Yeah.

125
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,350
I haven't touched on weight since college.
You know,

126
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:53,090
the only time I did was when I went over
and I started working with the UFC PR

127
00:06:53,091 --> 00:06:56,690
guys a little bit. They wanted me
to touch weights, but, uh, I, I,

128
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:59,210
it's just not a good fit for me.
Are you doing,

129
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,680
what are you doing plyometrics or you're
doing is he'd have to explain it to you

130
00:07:03,681 --> 00:07:07,040
more. You know, that's his,
that's what he does. He,

131
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:09,860
he worked through as xls for a long time,
so he took a lot of their,

132
00:07:09,861 --> 00:07:14,180
their physiology or xls.
What's exos? The, uh,

133
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,300
I think they just signed a deal with
the UFC to a lot of guys been going over

134
00:07:17,301 --> 00:07:21,560
and uh, they're a big strength and
conditioning program. They'd get,

135
00:07:21,561 --> 00:07:23,300
they've got a big
facility down in Arizona,

136
00:07:23,301 --> 00:07:25,310
but they used to be based out of Vegas.
Uh,

137
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:29,090
so he worked for them where he gets a lot
of his training philosophies and stuff

138
00:07:29,091 --> 00:07:33,170
from a, but it's not, it's not any,
any wait, listen, calisthenics.

139
00:07:33,171 --> 00:07:36,950
Chatting a lot of calisthenics,
lot of movement, a lot of,

140
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:40,940
we work a lot of the joints especially,
you know, where he overextends my joints,

141
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:44,420
he pushes them past, past the limit,
and then we work out from there.

142
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:47,410
So it's not very heavy lift
and it's maybe 15 pounds.

143
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:51,320
Do you mean by pushing them past the
limit? Like, like a hyper extended? Yeah,

144
00:07:51,321 --> 00:07:54,470
I mean, well, it's like you
getting onboard. So, uh,

145
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:57,040
one of the things we do
is he takes a band and he,

146
00:07:57,041 --> 00:08:00,450
and he stretches it out so it really pulls
my shoulder and I was telling you, I,

147
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:04,610
I very rarely have shoulder problems
and I think a large reason he,

148
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:07,580
he pulls it all the way out,
kind of out the socket.

149
00:08:07,581 --> 00:08:11,420
And then we work out from there
to build strength from those,

150
00:08:11,421 --> 00:08:14,630
those little muscles. Uh,
which I felt like is, is,

151
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,360
that's the part where I get my
true strength from. You know,

152
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,410
I do that a lot of yoga, a
lot, a lot of things that just,

153
00:08:21,411 --> 00:08:24,110
all the strength comes from within me.
Not Lifting weights or anything.

154
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:28,040
How often are you doing yoga when you're
in camp? A two to three times a week.

155
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:32,420
I've only been doing it for like four
or five months since, since the 25. Uh,

156
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:36,680
it's been helping me out a lot. When I,
when I started doing it guys, we're like,

157
00:08:36,681 --> 00:08:40,040
oh, what are you lifting or something?
I'm like, Nah, just I should, it's hard.

158
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:43,550
I'm like, Oh fuck it. Just do it. Yoga
like isn't it crazy how hard it is?

159
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:48,260
Like you just fucking off like,
yeah, I'm doing yoga. You Lazy Bitch,

160
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,400
stretch and touching your toes.
Maybe for like the first two months,

161
00:08:52,401 --> 00:08:55,040
like I'd be like ashamed to tell people.
They're like, where are you going to,

162
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:00,250
you know, going into this one class we're
going to be lifting a lot of weights.

163
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:04,660
We're going to be great. Like Shit. Nah,
I'm in there with like dumb fucking know.

164
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:09,390
Housewives, housewives and nick killing
me. It's crazy, right? They killing me,

165
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:11,850
killing me. I've done
good now though, but a,

166
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:18,660
I do a couple of different state,
even the Vinyasa a little bit.

167
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:22,830
I try and dabble, but I've only been
doing it for a couple months now.

168
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:26,320
Now when you do,
how do you structure your camp?

169
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:29,120
Like it terms of like how much
strength and conditioning you doing,

170
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,010
how much skill work,

171
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,540
how much? So it kind of depended
on, it depends on the opponent to,

172
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:39,280
but generally I'm doing three times
a week of, of some type of grappling,

173
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:42,830
whether it has wrestling
or, or, uh, Nogi uh,

174
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:46,910
then I only s spar once a week
at the end of the weeks, uh,

175
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,720
we pick our spar partners that
we pay, that we choose, you know,

176
00:09:49,721 --> 00:09:52,570
we flogged guys in or guys that
are in town, cause I'm in Vegas.

177
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,470
All gods are always in and out. Right.
Um, but then, uh, you know, I only,

178
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:58,990
I only do strength conditioning
maybe two times a week. Not Too much.

179
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:03,710
Now when you say, um, you spar once
a week and you bring guys in, um,

180
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,510
are you sparring hard or
do you far more technical?

181
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:10,310
Don't make camp, uh,
maybe four or five. Good.

182
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:15,050
But I go pretty hard and it ruins me
sometimes cause I run out of sparring

183
00:10:15,051 --> 00:10:18,440
partners and guys don't want to
show up and all this. But uh,

184
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:22,040
I ended up having to start paying guys
just come on man, give me some words.

185
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:25,600
Right. Yeah, we try and make some money.
Do you think that that's the way to go?

186
00:10:25,601 --> 00:10:29,230
Like, um, for longevity there's
a, there's a big debate, right?

187
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:32,680
Whether or not you should sparse skill
wise and then save it up for the fight or

188
00:10:32,681 --> 00:10:35,860
whether you should just fucking go to
war. I think, I think you need that,

189
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:40,970
that reaction time, you know, with a
god that's seriously throwing at you.

190
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:43,250
And I mean we're, we're not trying
to hurt each other for sure.

191
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:46,890
The smart partners, 80%, maybe
70%, something like that.

192
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:51,470
W W we go pretty hard up
until you obviously can see
that there's an injury or

193
00:10:51,471 --> 00:10:53,180
somebody is hurt or you know,
you backed down.

194
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:55,970
And even on like some of
my takedowns I bagged down,

195
00:10:55,971 --> 00:10:59,090
obviously I'm not trying
to knock the guy out,

196
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:03,210
but I am trying to give them some good
work. And I hope he does the same return,

197
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:07,100
but we picked smart guys that will do it.
That's what it's about at that level.

198
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:10,520
When you got two very high level
guys going against each other,

199
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:15,590
we can go hard and not injure. If I'm
going with like a new guy or you know,

200
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:17,900
it's a newer team, like I
don't even try. I gonna make

201
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:21,930
a name off a few fuck around this.
There's a lot of that man. Too much. Yeah.

202
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:25,130
I remember I ran into [inaudible] once
and his hand was in a cast and he hadn't

203
00:11:25,131 --> 00:11:27,050
had a fight in a while. I
said, what happened? He said,

204
00:11:27,051 --> 00:11:31,310
some new guy came into the gym and he's
sparring with this new guy and this new

205
00:11:31,311 --> 00:11:33,980
guy is trying to kill him and he
broke his hand on this dude's for it.

206
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,980
And I was thinking, your Vito
Belfort, I mean, and this is Vito.

207
00:11:36,981 --> 00:11:41,360
Or like I want to say like eight,
nine years ago. I was like, man,

208
00:11:41,361 --> 00:11:44,210
like that's crazy. But that's the
kind of shit that happens. Right.

209
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:47,130
And guys are very tough in a gym. I
mean, especially something illegal,

210
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:50,630
like they tougher than you think.
[inaudible] 16 and they're tough.

211
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,980
They're coming out with, with,
you know, newest. I think

212
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:57,500
each dinner generation has a new
style to that. You're, you, you,

213
00:11:57,501 --> 00:12:01,260
you don't get used to it. And if it, you
know, if the boys are catch you, if they,

214
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,680
they'd be hungry or they knew,
uh,

215
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:05,800
what you're seeing all these new guys
that are coming up that can do everything.

216
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:08,710
You know, they, they have like taekwondo
skills. They've got Moyie Thai,

217
00:12:08,711 --> 00:12:13,090
they can wrestle, they do flying
armbars and shit. There's just kids are,

218
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:18,270
because MMA is such a part of like the
zeitgeists now and everybody understands

219
00:12:18,281 --> 00:12:22,600
it and kids know,
if you want to be a really tough fighter,

220
00:12:22,601 --> 00:12:25,030
it's not about boxing,
it's about MMA.

221
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:29,710
And so you're getting these wild ass kids
that have really young age practicing

222
00:12:29,711 --> 00:12:33,220
this shit on each other, learning it,
trying going to gyms when they're nine,

223
00:12:33,221 --> 00:12:36,620
10 years old. By the time they're in high
school, they're killers. Yeah. I mean,

224
00:12:36,621 --> 00:12:39,490
and we have so many of them that
come through Vegas especially.

225
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:42,890
And I think that's what,
that's my favorite part about
living there is, is the,

226
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,370
the training partners. And
like you said, the new kids.

227
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:47,410
I try and even though I'm only 25,

228
00:12:47,411 --> 00:12:50,470
I'm trying to see what they
doing that's coming up next.

229
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,180
That's smart because they,

230
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:56,660
they're going to come with something that
UAC before it is some out there. Like,

231
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,430
like even my younger brother,
uh,

232
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:02,080
my younger brothers just getting started
in his America where he's only got five

233
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:05,830
profiles now, uh, eight in total.
So not that many fights, but the,

234
00:13:05,831 --> 00:13:08,770
some of the things that he do,
I'm like, you know, let me try it.

235
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:13,130
Let me learn from you a little bit.
Well, the pot bows a fight. Um,

236
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,790
you got clipped was a third round.
The beginning of the third round,

237
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:19,120
he got clipped with that. We'll kick
that. Recovery was amazing though, man.

238
00:13:19,121 --> 00:13:20,810
That's an amazing
recovery mean Barbara was,

239
00:13:20,811 --> 00:13:24,880
it puts people out with that shit
and your legs completely gave out.

240
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:29,800
But man, that's a weird moment,
right, where like anything,

241
00:13:29,801 --> 00:13:32,200
if he wasn't near you right,

242
00:13:32,201 --> 00:13:35,860
where you could grab a hold of him and
take him down if he just stepped back a

243
00:13:35,861 --> 00:13:40,390
little bit, you know? Interesting. Right?
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I was still there.

244
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:44,080
Uh, you know, I never went
away. And I think a lot of,

245
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,630
even the way I moved it,

246
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,940
when somebody showed me that video
after I cracked though, I was,

247
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:51,400
I was dying laughing because
when I'm in there, I don't,

248
00:13:51,401 --> 00:13:52,540
I don't know what happened.
You know,

249
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,720
I see the video and I see my legs just
go see the music is a cup of love of Bro.

250
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,840
They ain't pretty good though. I've
been laughing a lot though all morning.

251
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:05,820
Cause you won. It's funny.
It's funny, it's funny,

252
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:10,690
but I think a lot of you see my, a lot
of what I was, my focus going into,

253
00:14:10,691 --> 00:14:14,650
this one was really on my footwork,
uh, my balance, you know, doing yoga.

254
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,550
I've been dancing to a
little bit. Okay. Awesome.

255
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:23,360
Some ballet. I mean, I, you
know, I've heard a lot of
guys, look, Loma Chenko was uh,

256
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:27,580
you know, his dad had him enrolled
in dance for four fucking years,

257
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:31,810
traditional Russian dancing and he
credits that for his foot work. Yeah.

258
00:14:31,811 --> 00:14:34,450
I mean I've, I've only been doing
it for a short amount of time,

259
00:14:34,451 --> 00:14:38,440
but still I can tell right off the bat
and I think a lot of what you saw there

260
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:41,290
was that, you know, uh,
when I looked at before,

261
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,650
the only other fight I've ever got
dropped in her hurt seriously was uh,

262
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:46,240
the Leonardo Santos fight.

263
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:50,800
And really it was me drop him back on
my ankle and I broke my ankle in that

264
00:14:50,801 --> 00:14:54,170
fight. When I tried to stand back
up, it looked like a wobble to,

265
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:56,500
and that's why John Know
John McCarthy stepped in.

266
00:14:56,810 --> 00:15:00,470
So a lot of what I focused on was
the balance. So when my, you know,

267
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:04,280
that equilibrium gave off and you see
how it saw four guys in front of me,

268
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:07,170
I'm just like, let me just keep my
eyes on this motherfucker right here.

269
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:11,690
Cause you think of how hard Barboza is
usually to take down. You just got you.

270
00:15:11,691 --> 00:15:14,570
It was very fortunate that he was right
there for you to grab him because he was

271
00:15:14,571 --> 00:15:18,770
trying to move in for the kill. Yeah.
Yeah. I mean it's, if you were his coach,

272
00:15:18,771 --> 00:15:21,200
you would have been screaming,
get the fuck away from him. Right.

273
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:26,030
His coaches was not doing them no
favors by, I felt bad for the guy.

274
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:30,710
What do you mean they could, if
they could have did them better, uh,

275
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:36,110
through the sec, he, I probably could
have put them away in the second row. Um,

276
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:40,820
but he was panicking and I could see it
in them, you know, and this coach is like,

277
00:15:40,821 --> 00:15:42,950
cause them to panic a little bit more.
You know,

278
00:15:42,951 --> 00:15:44,660
they just kept screaming at him the time.
Like,

279
00:15:44,661 --> 00:15:48,830
you only got two minutes to survivor.
And I was like, let me not, you know,

280
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,680
new Barboza Nice Guy. He
really is. And uh, you know,

281
00:15:51,681 --> 00:15:53,150
I didn't want to hurt them too bad.

282
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:58,080
That's too very similar fights for him
in a row, two mornings in a row. That's,

283
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:01,640
you know, when you're that guy who
wants to stand up and you know,

284
00:16:01,641 --> 00:16:05,110
you got guys that are just, just
constant pressure, constant pressure,

285
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:08,900
know people don't realize
how much endurance it takes
to move away to you moving

286
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:13,160
backwards. It's a lot more difficult to
do. Yeah, true. I mean, I feel like it,

287
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:14,540
everything kind of pushed,
you know,

288
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,030
it's about who controls
the pace of the fight.

289
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:19,830
And I felt like I did a good
job of that. And again, I, I,

290
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:22,370
I thought even after I got wobbled
with the, with the kick and the third,

291
00:16:22,371 --> 00:16:25,670
I still came back and ground. Yeah. I
tried to make it a point to finish the,

292
00:16:25,671 --> 00:16:27,860
in that moment you weren't around,
you know,

293
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:31,610
and you heard him bad in the second round,
two with a kick to the body.

294
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:34,760
Like you see him cover up and tense
in that, but you could see it,

295
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:38,710
it was a strong right kick to the body.
One of the reporters he asked me like,

296
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:42,410
why was that standing at at range
with them? Uh, and it's just like,

297
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:46,740
I feel like I can do it all, you
know? And that's my true sense.

298
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,680
It's like I can stand at range with with,

299
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:52,370
I mean he's definitely the
most explosive dynamic. Uh,

300
00:16:52,371 --> 00:16:55,580
all those things that you want to say
that the best kicker in the lightweight

301
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:59,600
division and I and I can stand at range
with them and kick just as well with

302
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:01,640
them. I can wrestle with
the best wrestlers I can.

303
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:04,910
I can kick with the kick best kickbox is,
I could punch with the best boxers.

304
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:08,390
So A, why not test myself? I'm not one
of these guys who shy away from Shit.

305
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:11,810
He's an interesting case because
he's really primarily a kicker.

306
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,480
He will throw punches, but that's
not his strong suit. I mean,

307
00:17:14,481 --> 00:17:18,410
he's not a god that just wants to, you
know, just, just digging and throw bombs.

308
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:22,820
Yeah. But he got some bombs
hit me with that left.

309
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:27,500
He hit me with a, a Matias left hook
and the fifth round I was like, man,

310
00:17:27,501 --> 00:17:31,610
he's still there. The kid now, he
never gave up. He was taking a beating.

311
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,950
He hit me with a Matias left hook.

312
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:39,080
So I gave him one back and buses orbital
up. Pretty good plan. Uh, you know,

313
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:42,220
she was still there till the very
end. He, he, he can box to eat.

314
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,680
He's got some power in his hand. Yeah.
And the cut was a pretty nasty cut.

315
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:47,810
Pretty nasty cut over his right
eye when it stopped the fight.

316
00:17:47,811 --> 00:17:49,940
When you were you shocked that they stop?
Nah,

317
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,970
I thought, I thought it was
the right call. You know,

318
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:56,980
I think more coaches in MMA to definitely
get in there and a little bit sooner.

319
00:17:58,241 --> 00:18:01,690
And I think, I think that's what the, some
of our problem with his corner was to,

320
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:03,250
uh,
you know,

321
00:18:03,251 --> 00:18:06,550
you see some of these fights and you can
kind of tell when a guy just doesn't,

322
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,280
you know, it, it doesn't make
sense to make them take more beats.

323
00:18:09,281 --> 00:18:12,760
Not somebody like barbels. Barboza
is explosive to the very, very end.

324
00:18:12,761 --> 00:18:15,280
You have to give that to them. That's
the thing. You never know. Right. I mean,

325
00:18:15,281 --> 00:18:18,260
if he connected with that left hook,
perfect. And you went out and then,

326
00:18:18,261 --> 00:18:21,910
and then he's a hero, then you know, I
guess you, then you look like the asshole.

327
00:18:21,911 --> 00:18:25,130
But uh, you know, I don't know
is it's a deadline. Cross.

328
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,760
Yeah.
It's a tough decision.

329
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,880
You don't want to be there when you
guys getting beaten up like that and you

330
00:18:29,881 --> 00:18:30,930
have to make that call.

331
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,350
Yeah, yeah. No, I mean, maybe I'm just
speaking from, cause I'm not a coach yet.

332
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:37,470
Maybe, you know, my stance will change
when him, when I am a coach, but you know,

333
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:41,910
or if I have a coach, but
we'll see. Yeah. It's uh, it's,

334
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,750
it's different with D.
I mean,

335
00:18:43,751 --> 00:18:47,170
the same thing with referees and Keith
Peterson did a great job in that fight.

336
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:50,930
He's a God that doesn't get enough credit.
There's a, there's a few like, you know,

337
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:53,170
Herb Dean,
I think because John McCarthy is retired,

338
00:18:53,171 --> 00:18:55,890
I think he's the gold standard. Josh
Rosenthal, there's a bunch of really,

339
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:59,590
really good guys, but that's a
tough call to decide when to stop.

340
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,470
I think even Yamasaki, you
know, Yamasaki takes a lot of,

341
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:05,970
it takes on a lot of bullshit, especially
in front of me from, from Dana.

342
00:19:05,971 --> 00:19:10,740
Don't like him at all. He ate them. But
uh, he, he does a great job in there.

343
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:14,490
Even that, that fight where he let
the girl take a lot of punches,

344
00:19:14,491 --> 00:19:16,260
a lot of damage.
She was still moving.

345
00:19:16,261 --> 00:19:17,760
She was still showing
that she was in the fight.

346
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:20,910
I think you got to put that on her
coaches and her inner trainers.

347
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,770
They know that she's, if she's
really in there, you know,

348
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:28,240
some guys are just too tough
or they aren't good. Like,
like Barboza well she was

349
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:31,300
vinyl found shift Cenk coach.
It just shits been in there.

350
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,970
She just shouldn't have been there and
it was awful lot in the first UFC fight

351
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,510
and she's fighting a woman who's
just a straight up assassin.

352
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:40,370
Yeah. And it can't be on the breath. You
can't put it on the ref to know that,

353
00:19:40,371 --> 00:19:44,250
you know, or to to make that call.
The Rep has to be completely, uh,

354
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:49,160
you know, non, not
objective at all. Um, it's,

355
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,480
I think it's got to put it on the coaches.

356
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,230
They should know what weight do
you walk around at about one,

357
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:58,630
if I'm completely just kinda like bullshit
and doing whatever I've gotten to as

358
00:19:58,631 --> 00:19:59,660
high as like one 95.

359
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,400
Uh,
when you're in training,

360
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:05,680
like when you get like save your four
weeks out where you're at 85 usually when

361
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:09,930
85, 85, eight, you're cutting a lot of
weight man. Yeah. Yeah. I mean that's a,

362
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,720
do you see yourself ever moving to 70 or

363
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,480
[inaudible] 70 necessarily?

364
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:18,560
Just because though those guys there at
that point you're talking about a frame

365
00:20:18,561 --> 00:20:22,240
issue, right. You know, you got guys had
like six foot one and you know, they're,

366
00:20:22,241 --> 00:20:25,370
they're just, it's a, it's a
different, it's a different body style.

367
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:28,690
I trained with a lot of them. High
level welterweights tool, you knows,

368
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:33,770
it's a different body style that I'm more
suited for one 55. It's just, you know,

369
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:37,960
some of the things that I got to play
around with I think will keep happening in

370
00:20:37,961 --> 00:20:42,620
the upcoming months. I didn't project
that I would fight again until July or so.

371
00:20:42,621 --> 00:20:45,950
So a lot of the things that I was doing
diet wise was kind of getting to that

372
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:47,500
and they approached me with this barbells,
a fight

373
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,780
maybe like eight weeks earlier than that.

374
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:54,370
So I just had to do with that and to
do so is it a matter of just you didn't

375
00:20:54,371 --> 00:20:58,000
taper off quick enough or you just
came in too heavy before you started?

376
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:00,250
You know, it was just, it was
just the timing wise. You know,

377
00:21:00,251 --> 00:21:03,580
I missed it by one pound. Yeah. Yeah.
It's, it's some non that time and that I,

378
00:21:03,581 --> 00:21:06,250
that I've really got to figure out.
And that was the biggest problem with,

379
00:21:06,251 --> 00:21:09,930
with the, uh, Tony Ferguson fight. Uh,
you know, I can break it down for you. It,

380
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,040
so usually, uh, you know,

381
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:15,890
I'm normally about one 85 through six
weeks of diet and I can usually die it

382
00:21:15,891 --> 00:21:20,500
down until about 76 77.
That's where I'm optimal. Uh,

383
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:23,260
and then from there I start their
water cuts. So the week of the fight,

384
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:26,640
the Tuesday, I'm 76, uh, you know,

385
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:28,720
I saved that all the way until,
you know,

386
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:30,820
I overload my body with
water and you know,

387
00:21:30,821 --> 00:21:35,160
cause a flush out some of the sodium
and the carbs and all that. Um,

388
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:39,190
I saved the rest of that up until the
day before and I try and cut as much as I

389
00:21:39,191 --> 00:21:41,830
can as he has.

390
00:21:41,831 --> 00:21:45,970
I want to spend as little time
dehydrated that dehydrated as possible.

391
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:49,950
And I think that's some of the problem
with having these early morning Wayans is

392
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:54,430
the timing issue of it as you wake up
and then you have to start from the time

393
00:21:54,431 --> 00:21:57,480
you wake up rather than if it's at four
o'clock in the afternoon and like it

394
00:21:57,481 --> 00:22:01,240
used to be, you'd be able to do it
all throughout the day. Yeah, yeah.

395
00:22:01,241 --> 00:22:04,650
I can cut more, you know, reasonably
through the morning, you know,

396
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:07,060
you can wake up whenever you had more
time, you would have been able to make it.

397
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:10,040
Oh yeah, absolutely.
1%. Yeah. My body was,

398
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:12,940
I got confused when they were
doing this early morning wins.

399
00:22:12,941 --> 00:22:17,680
I thought you had like like from
8:00 AM to four o'clock right? Yeah.

400
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:20,080
I thought if you could weigh in early,
go ahead way in early.

401
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,830
But they gave you the time.
Yeah, I mean I, I'm not really,

402
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,440
I don't really know the solution either.
You know?

403
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:29,910
I don't think nobody really knows
the solution to that problem, the,

404
00:22:29,911 --> 00:22:33,190
the timeframe because you are seeing a
lot of guys miss weight because of that

405
00:22:33,191 --> 00:22:36,160
and I think that's, that's one of the
biggest problems and not only that,

406
00:22:36,161 --> 00:22:39,730
but guys are going asleep completely
dehydrated and sleeping through the night,

407
00:22:39,731 --> 00:22:43,120
20 pounds, the hydrated, that's a
lot of water coming from your blood.

408
00:22:43,121 --> 00:22:46,450
Your blood gets thicker, your heart rate
slows down when you, when you sleep.

409
00:22:46,451 --> 00:22:51,370
I mean, you know, I try my best not to
spend as much time dehydrated as possible.

410
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,440
So it's just a timing
issue on that last one.

411
00:22:53,441 --> 00:22:56,740
Especially when you see guys like those
on Joe's that just can't do it anymore

412
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:59,770
and he goes up to 70 he looks better
than ever. What do you think about that?

413
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:04,840
It is, it's always an option for me. It
would be an option now, like I, I would,

414
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:08,270
I would entertain the right fight at
it for sure. It's just right now at,

415
00:23:08,271 --> 00:23:09,530
at the state of it is,
you know,

416
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,680
they're doing this bullshit
interim title and you know,

417
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:14,020
Tyron sitting right there and just,
it's a lot of movement.

418
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:15,940
It's not a lot of movement
at the top right now.

419
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:19,390
So one 55 just more fights interests me.
It's bigger challenges.

420
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:24,040
I think the guys are honestly better
at one 55 one 70 maybe in a future,

421
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:26,740
but you know, it's gotta be the right
type of fight or something. Yeah.

422
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:31,090
Well there's so many good fighters now
from, I mean, you go all across the board.

423
00:23:31,091 --> 00:23:33,910
I mean pretty much every week class.
It's strong now. But yeah, I agree.

424
00:23:33,911 --> 00:23:36,980
I think 55 is probably the strongest
way class right now and it's,

425
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:40,240
and it's so strong that you can
make a one 65 I don't mean, I don't,

426
00:23:40,241 --> 00:23:42,090
I really don't see what
the holdup is on it.

427
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:47,430
Do a 65 to a 75 because we have so many
guys that can bounce between those.

428
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:52,790
And you'll have a whole new top 15 whole
new champion in the be just as strong

429
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:55,700
as any of the two weight classes
next to it. I couldn't agree more.

430
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:58,760
I think it's very important
that we spread it out better.

431
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:03,280
I think 10 pounds is reasonable then. I
mean the way boxing has it, they just,

432
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:06,680
you know, they have a 54 and then they
have a 60 that seems a little ridiculous.

433
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:11,480
47 and then they have a 54 I think
you'd be better off with 10 just said

434
00:24:11,481 --> 00:24:13,370
straight up 10 pounds.
That's reasonable.

435
00:24:13,371 --> 00:24:17,650
But when you go from like 85 to two
oh five, that shit's crazy. Big Boys.

436
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:23,390
What's up big? Some of them to
even 55 to 70 because most guys,

437
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:28,310
uh, you know, like a normal sized guy,
he's about my size, 180 590 pounds.

438
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:31,010
That puts you in that,
in that middle, you know,

439
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:34,130
you got guys like me with a lot of muscle
where I'm not going to lose a lot of

440
00:24:34,131 --> 00:24:37,820
fat in between. You know, even
for this one, I was one 77,

441
00:24:37,821 --> 00:24:41,210
but I was four and a half percent body
fat. You know, I couldn't really lean.

442
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,400
He can't get too much more lean
in that uh, uh, 64 and a half.

443
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:47,960
Somebody fighting when
you wait in. Yeah. Before,

444
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,870
well I was four and a half percent maybe
two weeks before the fight actually.

445
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:53,300
But are you getting calipers?
Are you doing the how they,

446
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:56,540
how they tested in over at the
few in the water? Not all over it.

447
00:24:56,541 --> 00:24:59,940
The Pi they have. Especially the
scanning. Yeah. They've got like,

448
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,960
so the scales aren't that good yet.
Here's the thing about those scales,

449
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:06,410
those scales when you hold onto those
things and some of them are okay,

450
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:09,230
but the best way they
say is submerging you.

451
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:12,800
There's a submerge one and there's
another one that uses some sort of like

452
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:13,970
electricity thing,

453
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:18,620
like you lying in a bed and then I think
the performance institute has that too.

454
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:22,350
There explain that shit to me. Yeah. Yeah.
The, the, the, the full scanner. Yeah.

455
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:26,360
I've done that a few times, but
it's much quicker, much easier.

456
00:25:26,361 --> 00:25:28,280
Just to get on the scale and
as long as it's real low,

457
00:25:28,281 --> 00:25:32,420
four and a half percent sounds a
does. But as long as it's, it's uh,

458
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:35,360
still the same measurement.
You know what I'm saying?

459
00:25:35,361 --> 00:25:38,820
As my last fight for the Tony Fight,
I was five and a half percent on.

460
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:42,920
So as long as it's in the same with the
same calipers, I mean they're using,

461
00:25:42,921 --> 00:25:46,940
you know that you're basically on point.
Yeah, exactly. I can compare it at least.

462
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:49,870
Uh, but again I can't get much
that much leaner. You know,

463
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:53,670
it's mostly just going to come out of
water. If they added 65, then you know, I,

464
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:56,360
I've got 10 more pounds of water
that I don't have to cut out.

465
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,560
Fucking ridiculous.

466
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,890
How frustrating was it for you going
into that Tony Ferguson fight with that

467
00:26:00,891 --> 00:26:03,550
staph infection because that was a,
that was a serious fall.

468
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:07,910
I didn't notice it at the weigh ins but
then the moment you walked into the cage,

469
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:11,480
it was funny man because they were
telling DC don't talk about it cause I was

470
00:26:11,481 --> 00:26:15,160
going that staff that that is fucking
staff. And then they said to DC,

471
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:19,250
don't talk about it. He goes,
Yup, that looks like staff
to me. He just ignored him.

472
00:26:19,251 --> 00:26:22,250
He was like, fuck you. That's that man.

473
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:25,250
I don't know why they didn't want
anybody breaking it up because it's an

474
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:25,971
important point.

475
00:26:25,971 --> 00:26:30,971
It's an unfortunate thing that
happens during training sometimes.

476
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:33,920
Yeah. Eight a, I kind of noticed
him on a Sunday, you know,

477
00:26:33,921 --> 00:26:37,130
and then Tuesday we do the check ins
and everything and uh, I had the girl,

478
00:26:37,131 --> 00:26:38,490
I'm like, ew, you know,

479
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:42,350
put some makeup on it because I
didn't want nobody to find out.

480
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:45,800
And even Tony, you know, I, if he
would have saw it, he would have no,

481
00:26:45,801 --> 00:26:49,650
he knew our compromise all that.
Um, but yeah, it frustrated things.

482
00:26:49,651 --> 00:26:52,140
They make things a lot more complicated.
It put me,

483
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:57,450
it made the weight cut terrible.
Uh, just to go back to it, I mean,

484
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:00,530
I'm cutting from 76 to to fifties.

485
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,650
I had to be 55 for that fight and
I try my best to skim it down, uh,

486
00:27:04,651 --> 00:27:05,730
in about 12 hours.

487
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:09,960
So I woke up at 5:00 AM
with at about one 62.

488
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:14,030
Uh, and Wayne's are
between nine and 11. Um,

489
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:19,190
and from 5:00 AM til 8:00 AM I had only
cut one pound compare to in other cuts

490
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,100
that have gone really well.

491
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:26,730
I'll normally cut by four or five
pounds in that time. But because I,

492
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:30,210
I just was feeling good and I
wasn't worried about it. And thus,

493
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:33,420
and I was using the same temperature of
water, I was using the same everything,

494
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:36,600
but the staff may my
body hold onto the water.

495
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:40,800
So when I went down and checked and saw
that it was still like five pounds up

496
00:27:40,801 --> 00:27:42,510
with like two hours ago,

497
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:47,780
they started like throwing a boiling
hot water on me to get my botany. Yeah.

498
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:51,450
To give me sweat and to get it
off. It was brutal. That's a for,

499
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:55,530
for know for someone who doesn't,
never, never experienced staff.

500
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:57,310
Explain what it does to your body.
Yeah.

501
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:00,990
It makes it feel the next day I just,

502
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:06,630
I felt so tired. I never felt as
tired in my life. And it felt,

503
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:11,460
I felt so tired to the point where I tried
to counteract it by getting myself as

504
00:28:11,461 --> 00:28:14,400
pumped as I can. And the, you know,

505
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,380
would you normally get there
two hours before the fight?

506
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:19,950
When I walked into the arena that night,
two hours before I was in a sweat,

507
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,130
you know,
my body was like full of adrenaline.

508
00:28:22,131 --> 00:28:25,330
Like I wasn't taking any medication.
You weren't going on in antibiotics.

509
00:28:25,331 --> 00:28:29,310
He figured I do have to decide whether
you should take antibiotics and then,

510
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:31,950
you know,
that compromises your endurance for sure.

511
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:34,680
Or just let your body fight it off.
I had it before,

512
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:38,010
so I had been on the antibiotics and
they just make terrible, you know,

513
00:28:38,011 --> 00:28:41,850
if you've ever been through it,
I mean, it's a terrible feeling.

514
00:28:41,851 --> 00:28:43,890
So I'd just like,
you know what,

515
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:47,830
I think I can just push through it
and I'm young and I was like, fuck it.

516
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:52,140
Let's just go like,
did you try any like a natural remedies?

517
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:56,160
You know,
it wasn't a whole lot I could take,

518
00:28:56,161 --> 00:29:00,580
cause I also got to cut the weight still.
Uh, there's not some topical stuff that,

519
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:03,330
one of the things they say that
works really well, topical,

520
00:29:03,331 --> 00:29:06,070
believe it or not is mince garlic.
Very Long.

521
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:10,020
Garlic apparently has a tremendous
effect on staph infections.

522
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,410
I was swallowing whole cloves of ginger.
I remember I would take ginger,

523
00:29:13,411 --> 00:29:17,230
I would chop it up and I'll swallow
it to see if that would do some,

524
00:29:17,231 --> 00:29:20,490
but it's hard. Yeah, it's a
heart. There's a lot other cause.

525
00:29:20,491 --> 00:29:24,280
Some real strong antibacterial properties
and one of the people that have been

526
00:29:24,281 --> 00:29:27,090
on the podcast many times
Doctor Rhonda Patrick said she,

527
00:29:27,091 --> 00:29:31,560
she had dealt with some persistent staph
infection and she had like a, you know,

528
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:36,270
hole in her skin and what she did was
she took garlic and packed it into that

529
00:29:36,271 --> 00:29:40,860
hole. Jen and fucking killed
it. I mean Jesus, I wish I
would've known that before.

530
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:44,020
I just kind of just fought
through it. I was like, fuck it.

531
00:29:44,021 --> 00:29:47,560
I'm just going to defense soap makes
some really good stuff for that too.

532
00:29:47,561 --> 00:29:49,270
They make us these essential oils.

533
00:29:49,271 --> 00:29:53,380
It's tea tree oil and eucalyptus oil
and you put it on like right where they

534
00:29:53,381 --> 00:29:54,214
have an issue.

535
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:58,990
Where were you in in October would have
been there for anybody else there that

536
00:29:58,991 --> 00:29:59,890
has that staff.

537
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:04,120
Anytime you have any sort of a
ring warm or staff or anything,

538
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:08,380
there's some natural stuff. Not like
some bullshit homeopathic nonsense,

539
00:30:08,381 --> 00:30:11,530
but some actual real natural
stuff that can help you.

540
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:15,580
And Defense soap specializes
in that because a guy sacco,

541
00:30:15,581 --> 00:30:17,820
the guy who owns the
company, he is, you know,

542
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:22,300
coaches wrestling and deals with kids
that always have ringworm and staph

543
00:30:22,301 --> 00:30:24,130
infection. So she can, he
came out with these soaps.

544
00:30:24,131 --> 00:30:27,130
He's natural soaps that are
just designed for grapplers.

545
00:30:27,131 --> 00:30:28,600
That's why it's called defense soap.
No.

546
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:33,640
And then I'll have him send you some and
then the essential oils and balms and

547
00:30:33,641 --> 00:30:36,250
stuff like ointments for
scratches and shit like that.

548
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:39,220
So they don't get infected.
That's, you know, Jim's, it's,

549
00:30:39,221 --> 00:30:41,080
you're always getting an
infected. Yeah. And that's it.

550
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,240
That was one of the biggest
focuses of this canvas.

551
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,640
Like make sure I stay healthy because
they, if you don't have your health,

552
00:30:45,641 --> 00:30:46,474
you don't have nothing.

553
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:50,350
And that was what it was at that
Tony fight and it's just, it,

554
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,060
it became something I didn't want to.

555
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:57,280
It was such a big event and it was my
first real big event to a that I just

556
00:30:57,281 --> 00:30:59,680
wanted it all just to go ride and go over.

557
00:30:59,681 --> 00:31:04,390
But it ended up being just a lot of my,
by the staff originally.

558
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:07,780
I think it came from mental
stress, you know, it,

559
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:11,730
it was so many stresses going on,
you know, you really sure. Yeah.

560
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,170
And you look at the three
biggest stressors, you know,

561
00:31:14,171 --> 00:31:17,260
I was going through a divorce and
I had just moved into a house.

562
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,880
You look at those in a normal day to day
life that though those are like the two

563
00:31:21,881 --> 00:31:22,601
biggest stressors,

564
00:31:22,601 --> 00:31:26,830
you can have a then to add on fighting
for a world title in six weeks.

565
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:30,020
So I'm just like, oh, that's fucking
go. Like I was like, you know,

566
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:34,390
I wasn't expecting to, I was thinking
maybe a, they was gonna give me Tony,

567
00:31:34,391 --> 00:31:37,390
but maybe in December. Indeed and in
Detroit or if something like that,

568
00:31:37,391 --> 00:31:40,710
but he was like six weeks. I was
like, hi, what fog does, right.

569
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,570
They were thinking about doing you in
Detroit. Right. That was a, that was,

570
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:47,560
that was the talk. And you were requesting
a big fight in Detroit? Yeah, yeah.

571
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:49,050
That's where all my life,
you know,

572
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:52,220
every year I kind of Chore
Plan Out my year and a and a,

573
00:31:52,221 --> 00:31:55,540
and I got my vision in my head.
I got to call them water bulls in there.

574
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:57,250
That was one of them.
But yeah,

575
00:31:57,251 --> 00:32:01,240
it ended up putting a little bit too much
stress on me all at once and I took on

576
00:32:01,241 --> 00:32:04,480
a lot for that one. But you
did learn, tell you what man,

577
00:32:04,481 --> 00:32:08,530
when you took him down and mounted him
and the first round I was like Holy Shit.

578
00:32:08,531 --> 00:32:10,870
Cause I know how good Tony
is on the ground. You know,

579
00:32:10,871 --> 00:32:13,990
it's interesting because you don't,
you look at someone when they fight,

580
00:32:13,991 --> 00:32:16,780
and this is one of the things that
I've been saying about Khabib. Um,

581
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:21,010
it's because it's so hard because
he's doing what people do, right?

582
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:23,270
He's taking people down this
mountain and grounding, pounding.

583
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:26,320
But he's doing it to people that
other people can't do it too.

584
00:32:26,321 --> 00:32:28,780
And he's doing it in a way that it's like,
wow,

585
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:33,010
how good is this motherfucker like
when he was mall and Michael Johnson,

586
00:32:33,011 --> 00:32:35,680
I was like, how fucking good
is he? Cause this is crazy.

587
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:40,400
Like he's in that moment
several better than anybody.

588
00:32:40,401 --> 00:32:41,810
Michael had fought before on the ground.

589
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:47,090
And when I'm seeing you first of all see
the chaos of fight in right to this day,

590
00:32:47,091 --> 00:32:51,320
I'm like, Jesus fucking Christ. Just
let them go out. Let them go out.

591
00:32:51,321 --> 00:32:55,370
And we would have known, but that
minor controversy from that moment,

592
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:59,150
you've got to fully locked in rear
naked choke. And he still conscious.

593
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:03,770
Let them go out. He doesn't want to tap.
Let 'em go out. He, he was going lip.

594
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:08,330
He was maybe but let them go out. But
you know the fit is it, you can't,

595
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:11,420
you can't some guys 10 but the
thing is what you're saying,

596
00:33:11,421 --> 00:33:14,990
but I know Hixon camp. Yeah.
But the thing is that the ref,

597
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:16,550
you can't put that on a Rep.
You know,

598
00:33:16,551 --> 00:33:20,930
it's defend yourself and Ted Intelligent
Mario was that Mario, Mario. But it's,

599
00:33:20,931 --> 00:33:21,860
it's defend yourself.

600
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:28,610
Defend yourself intelligently.
It all, you can't,

601
00:33:28,611 --> 00:33:32,870
you can't say I'm blocking punches
with my face until the guy gets tired,

602
00:33:32,871 --> 00:33:35,680
you know, you can't say, oh, I'm just
going to try to sleep in this choke.

603
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:40,520
The guy trying to concentrate on his neck
and just completely tensed up his neck

604
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:44,900
and try to push blood through. I've
seen guys do that. I know. I feel you,

605
00:33:44,901 --> 00:33:49,010
but only to a point, right. Only to a
point. Right. And then you go to sleep,

606
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:53,490
go to sleep. Yeah. I mean, yeah, I'm with
you. He could have let them go. But uh,

607
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:54,770
I think as soon as he,

608
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:59,510
as soon as Mario saw that his hands went
from fighting the hands to doing this,

609
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:02,390
Mario stopped it. I mean, and, and I
thought it was a good stop. I mean,

610
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:05,780
it's not a bad stop it as such,
but it was controversial.

611
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:09,260
You can call it odd things. Controversy's
always good. I said that right after,

612
00:34:09,261 --> 00:34:13,460
like keep it up, keep it going. Like I
love it. They got you to talk about it.

613
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:17,540
So about,
this is an undercard fight,

614
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:21,020
but it became like bigger even then a lot
of the other fights on the car because

615
00:34:21,021 --> 00:34:24,470
of the, yeah, yeah. No, no,
we uh, we headlined that, that
event, you know, that wasn't,

616
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:29,480
it wasn't, I thought that was like a paper
view. That's right. Yeah, you're right.

617
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:30,890
I'm sorry it's doing my thing.

618
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:36,660
But that fight was really like a
top contender for mean chaos. Uh,

619
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:40,220
had been on a roll.
He's very strong on the ground,

620
00:34:40,221 --> 00:34:42,650
which is one of the reasons why it was
so impressive that you took his back and

621
00:34:42,651 --> 00:34:46,760
choked him like that. Yeah.
I mean, I think I have a
different style than, than, uh,

622
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:50,810
a lot of people can see, you
know, you, you, you go back
to Khabib and, and all this.

623
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:54,140
I like, his style is, it's
good. It's obviously very good,

624
00:34:54,141 --> 00:34:57,500
but I can see a lot of holes in it.
And I saw those holes many years ago.

625
00:34:57,501 --> 00:34:59,750
I've been called how big could beat for
years I've been wanting to fight them

626
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:03,770
just because people got those questions.
I've got those questions too.

627
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:06,890
So I'm like, let's see what this
motherfucker got like, because I see it,

628
00:35:06,891 --> 00:35:10,340
I see them hoes, you know, I don't really
focus on too much of the good. I'm like,

629
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:15,410
what holes? I got that boy number.
I'll tell you what are the holes?

630
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:17,000
What do you see it,
you know,

631
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:19,540
even though some of his take
on a lot of his takedowns, he,

632
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:24,050
he misses a lot of them. You know, he's
very square. He kinda just bum rushes.

633
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:26,990
You know, people were talking about the
Barboza fight before and they're like,

634
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:29,840
are you looking at that fight and you're
going to try and build off that one?

635
00:35:29,841 --> 00:35:33,650
I'm like, yeah. I mean he
did okay. The fight was good.

636
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:36,800
He'd beat the hell out of Barboza,
but I saw the holes in it. You know,

637
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,260
he's just running a square for

638
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,350
Adam, you know, he's, he
got hit with a lot of shots.

639
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,270
I didn't see it for people in the outside
watching him because the way he just

640
00:35:45,271 --> 00:35:47,850
came forward on Barboza was like,
he was indestructable

641
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:51,240
it didn't matter. I'm just going to
get you. It's just a matter of time.

642
00:35:51,241 --> 00:35:53,550
Keep throwing your kicks. I'm going
to get you. I'm going to get you. Ooh,

643
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:54,060
I got you.

644
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:57,080
You got those guys. But the body gives
up. You know you got Justin Gates,

645
00:35:57,081 --> 00:36:00,110
you as the same way the body
will give up and met with you.

646
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:03,210
You can't keep putting your body
on the line like that. I mean,

647
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:06,090
if he wants to run at me square
four square like that, that's

648
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:09,390
what I'm getting paid.

649
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:13,140
I'm getting paid. Oh sorry. I love
the, I love watching him fight,

650
00:36:13,141 --> 00:36:17,610
but part of me is like Jesus man,
just if he mixed what he can do,

651
00:36:17,611 --> 00:36:21,240
cause he's one of the very best
at leg kicks and close that too,

652
00:36:21,241 --> 00:36:24,480
to be in the middle of a combination
like chest to chest with you and then

653
00:36:24,481 --> 00:36:28,410
somehow or another he whips a leg kick
straight down on your leg. I mean,

654
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:29,730
he's nasty with that.

655
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:32,110
He's, he's got a couple of things
that he does real good. You know, I,

656
00:36:32,111 --> 00:36:35,620
I've been studying get you too. He's
just, he, he's just hardheaded than him.

657
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:36,970
He like, he don't, he don't care.

658
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:41,380
We'll take it. Yeah. He'll just take it
and just walk right into it. But it's,

659
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:45,010
it seems like we, when you look
at all the skills that he has,

660
00:36:45,011 --> 00:36:48,790
like that would be better represented
with some movement and some foot work and

661
00:36:48,791 --> 00:36:49,624
some other things.

662
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,220
Yeah. Especially with a guy like Trevor
Whitman in this morning and you know,

663
00:36:52,221 --> 00:36:55,890
Trevor's a great, great
coach. He did the rose.

664
00:36:56,290 --> 00:37:00,560
He's been there. I think their
styles are, are very opposite. Uh,

665
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:03,790
you know, he should probably listen
to him a little bit more, like a,

666
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:06,110
even one of the things with
me and Robert Falls, you know,

667
00:37:06,111 --> 00:37:08,300
I had been with brother Robert was the,

668
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:13,250
the pretty much the only reason why
I moved to Vegas, uh, because he,

669
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:18,290
there's a, there's a weird bond between
a, like a fighter and a coach, you know,

670
00:37:18,291 --> 00:37:22,420
and, and he just got me more
than any other coach before or,

671
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:26,180
or since we'll, you know,
uh, we were very different,

672
00:37:26,181 --> 00:37:29,780
but he just understood me as
an athlete a little bit more.

673
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:32,750
And even some of the things that he
would tell me, I wouldn't listen to it.

674
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:36,950
Like he, you know, maybe like, you know,
he tried to tell me to stay smart and,

675
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:42,200
you know, not bra, because at the end
of the day, Joe, I could, I'm like,

676
00:37:42,201 --> 00:37:45,110
fuck this, I'm a fight. You know,
I'm a buy down on my mouthpiece.

677
00:37:45,111 --> 00:37:47,310
He tried to get me to be smarter.
Uh,

678
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:52,740
and just some of the things that he
would say to me resonated way more than

679
00:37:52,741 --> 00:37:57,160
anybody else.
So I think now that he's gone,

680
00:37:57,490 --> 00:38:02,410
I've put what he said, it's still
in my head and it, you know,

681
00:38:02,411 --> 00:38:06,550
I try and follow it even more
now, you know? Uh, and I,

682
00:38:06,551 --> 00:38:10,090
I wish somebody like gates you
wouldn't listen because, you know,

683
00:38:10,091 --> 00:38:13,330
Whitman is telling them what to do,
the right thing to do. He should,

684
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:14,290
he should probably listen to him.

685
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:18,580
Well, I think Trevor just
tries to compliment your
style and gauge you styles.

686
00:38:18,581 --> 00:38:20,810
Just savage. He's just, he's just

687
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:24,270
going to war. We're going to
war every time you go to war.

688
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:29,640
I guess I get it. Yeah. But you
know, I watch, I think you can,

689
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:31,710
I think you'd learn from learning
from somebody else, you know,

690
00:38:31,711 --> 00:38:35,340
I think everybody has what
they do that that's like say I,

691
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:40,300
I try and create a strong team around
me where everybody has what they do and

692
00:38:40,301 --> 00:38:42,400
I'm just going to try and
listen to him, you know, and,

693
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:45,020
and even more so now it's not,

694
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,820
I understand that a little bit more
as I'm getting older and you know,

695
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:52,210
going through life too with it. I said,
well rob, you know what, one of the,

696
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,040
one of the reporters there,
he asked me, he was like,

697
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:58,690
we seen you in there talking and they
thought I was talking to Barboza. Uh,

698
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:02,770
but I was really just talking to myself
like I was saying things that he would

699
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:06,670
say or the Robert.
Yeah. Robert was saying,

700
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:10,180
and I'm saying them to myself
and I guess my mouth was moving.

701
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:13,150
I don't really know. I thought it was
in my head the whole time, but, uh,

702
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:16,840
I guess like some of the reporters
could see it. Uh, but you know,

703
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:18,820
I really tried to make that a focus on.
Interesting.

704
00:39:18,821 --> 00:39:23,470
So do you do that in sparring
too? Uh, I don't, I don't know.

705
00:39:23,471 --> 00:39:26,320
I usually try. And did you realize you
were doing it until they brought it up?

706
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:29,420
I didn't realize. I know and not
because he, when he asked me that,

707
00:39:29,421 --> 00:39:31,830
it kind of caught me off guard
because I remember in the fight I'm,

708
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:36,150
I'm very cerebral. I, I, I
remember everything about it. Uh,

709
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:39,880
but I remember I was going to say
something to Barboza to, you know,

710
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,700
I talking my shit, you know, I
do it in quite some time to time,

711
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:44,260
but it didn't cause he was a nice guy.

712
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:47,860
I didn't realize that I was
talking to myself too on it. Even.

713
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,520
So you were just kind of going through
the things that you wanted to focus on in

714
00:39:51,521 --> 00:39:55,510
the fight while it was happening and
like stay, you're saying even the kick,

715
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:56,470
the kick that he landed,

716
00:39:56,770 --> 00:40:00,910
if you see like a microsecond before
that I was nodding my head because I was,

717
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:06,340
I was, I took my mind off them for a
split second. I saw the knock out there,

718
00:40:06,341 --> 00:40:09,280
I seen him dip to his left and I'm
like, oh, next time he did, so I'm,

719
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:14,140
I'm about to get it.
So I started to talk and I was like,

720
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,280
ah.
I like,

721
00:40:15,281 --> 00:40:18,860
I got this and I took my mind off of him
and he hit me with that fucking spin.

722
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:24,370
But what it should have said was stay
sharp, you know, stay, stay focused.

723
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:27,220
Like that's what I was saying in the
fourth and the fifth round after that kick

724
00:40:27,221 --> 00:40:29,080
landed, I was like, stay
sharp. Stay focused on him.

725
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:32,020
I'm just saying that to myself
because that's what Robert told me.

726
00:40:32,021 --> 00:40:34,210
He wouldn't tell me to
look for the knockout.

727
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:38,050
What was the thought process when you're
going to face a guy like Barboza that's

728
00:40:38,051 --> 00:40:41,050
such a dangerous kicker.
Was it a lot of faints plus pressure?

729
00:40:41,051 --> 00:40:44,830
Like what was the thought process about
getting close to him with a guy like

730
00:40:44,831 --> 00:40:48,280
Barboza, he throws everything
so hard and so explosive.

731
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,890
I knew I was going to have
to eat some of that, uh,

732
00:40:50,891 --> 00:40:53,740
and just keep pushing forward and
just not take my eyes off of him.

733
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:57,610
Even when I got wobbled and I was wrong,
I just try not take my eyes off of him,

734
00:40:57,611 --> 00:41:02,030
you know, with, with a, with a guy like
that, that's such a great athlete. Uh,

735
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:06,280
which is what I considered Barboza as
you know, rob had these three things.

736
00:41:06,281 --> 00:41:09,730
He put everybody in an athlete,
a competitor or fighter category,

737
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:14,140
and Barboza was like apitomy of
an athlete. Uh, but with that,

738
00:41:14,141 --> 00:41:17,680
you can't show him no,
you can't show him that he's doing good.

739
00:41:17,681 --> 00:41:20,920
You know what I'm saying? So every
time you was stolen, and I'm just like,

740
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:25,870
that fucking switch kick is ridiculous.
He's got the most ridiculous,

741
00:41:25,871 --> 00:41:30,260
which kicking the game so fast,
Mark Della Grotto,

742
00:41:30,261 --> 00:41:34,070
who's seen some of the best of
the best fight in Thailand, in,

743
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:37,820
in real, you know, in life. And
like right there in person, he said,

744
00:41:37,821 --> 00:41:40,910
I've never seen a guy with a faster
switch kick. He was even the top,

745
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:44,340
the most elite of the ties. He
goes, that's the fastest way.

746
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:47,340
Everyone's saying they're tired tire.
I'm, I beat the hell out of him.

747
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,190
And he was still thought,
I was like,

748
00:41:49,191 --> 00:41:53,440
how is this even possible to even
in the third and fourth round swap?

749
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:56,600
And some of it, I'm kind of like
looking while I'm in there, I'm like,

750
00:41:56,630 --> 00:42:00,980
what is he doing that can make
him do that? You know? Uh,

751
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:04,040
I try and steal a little bit from
every guy that a fight especially,

752
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:08,930
and I'm like, what is he doing as allowing
him to be that Goddamn fast with it?

753
00:42:08,931 --> 00:42:13,220
But you know, I prepare, I prepare with
a lot of high level kickboxers that,

754
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,750
you know, they got that
style, that kicking it.

755
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:17,510
Just kick it fucking block
off if you let them. Yeah.

756
00:42:17,511 --> 00:42:18,920
You're going to get something from that.
Right?

757
00:42:18,921 --> 00:42:22,070
Like the little [inaudible] calls
it the rub and then your fight.

758
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:26,000
Someone's real good. You get that rub from
him, from him. You just realize now, oh,

759
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:28,960
those kids could come at you that
fast. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, and,

760
00:42:28,961 --> 00:42:32,310
and you get that in a lot of different
ways. Uh, like, like with Tony, you know,

761
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:37,330
Tony did a lot of things in there
that I didn't expect and I didn't,

762
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:39,800
you know,
didn't really plan for it.

763
00:42:39,801 --> 00:42:43,220
It's only so much planning that you can
do until you get in there and you need

764
00:42:43,221 --> 00:42:44,810
that experience to rely back on.

765
00:42:44,811 --> 00:42:46,940
And I feel like that's what I'm
building up at a young age. Even.

766
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:51,950
It's possible for you to rematch with
Tony Ain't got to get touch with Tony now

767
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:56,480
coming off of that very disappointing
fall, you know when he was,

768
00:42:56,570 --> 00:43:00,230
which is crazy. I feel bad for her to do
say something to, this is very important.

769
00:43:00,231 --> 00:43:03,500
And I actually have pictures
too. I'm going to send them
to you right now, Jamie.

770
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:08,450
So we could put it online because uh,
everybody was repeating the,

771
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:13,310
the,
the thought that he had worn sunglasses.

772
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:18,270
Um, and that's why he fell down,
um, that he was wearing sunglasses,

773
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:22,550
his little AP wearing them
little misspoke. He misspoke.

774
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,440
And he said it too.

775
00:43:24,441 --> 00:43:28,310
I think he said my prescription
sunglasses to Ariel Helwani.

776
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:31,940
I think that's what they were saying.
The square ones that he wears a,

777
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:35,540
I'll send it. I'm going to send it
to Jamie right now, but it wasn't,

778
00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:39,540
but he was probably wearing sunglasses.
No photos.

779
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:44,910
Totally. I'll find it. God Damn
it. Tony loves those songs.

780
00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:50,270
I know. He does love the,
okay. I know where it is. Um,
he does love the sunglasses.

781
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:53,360
Don't, he's a smart guy. You
know, I, I don't, I don't, I
don't hold that against him.

782
00:43:53,410 --> 00:43:58,410
He was probably something that was already
injured in his leg and I feel bad for

783
00:43:58,521 --> 00:44:00,470
the guy and I really do.
I don't think you'll ever be the same.

784
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:04,960
Coming back off that one. The, that's
a big, you know, I hear detached.

785
00:44:04,961 --> 00:44:08,510
It detached them for the
loan. I mean, that's huge.

786
00:44:08,511 --> 00:44:11,690
Especially at 34 to try and come
back off that that's it's going to,

787
00:44:12,010 --> 00:44:15,110
and it kind of sucks for me too,
because I think I fought the best.

788
00:44:15,111 --> 00:44:19,610
Tony Ferguson that you're going to
see a period. Really? You think so?

789
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:21,250
Because it was before that injury.
Yeah.

790
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,320
I don't think he's going to
be the same again after any,

791
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:26,450
he'll come back and he'll still beat
a great guys. You know, he's still,

792
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:30,020
he's still going to do very good. But
you know, I don't think it be the same.

793
00:44:30,021 --> 00:44:30,920
And you know,

794
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,600
dammit, I got this photo in
here somewhere. I'm going
to find it. I can't find it.

795
00:44:36,350 --> 00:44:39,710
I'll send it to you later.
But in the photo he's wearing glasses.

796
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:42,680
He's not wearing per se.
He's not wearing prescription sunglasses.

797
00:44:42,681 --> 00:44:46,160
He said he misspoke and said
prescription sunglasses.

798
00:44:46,370 --> 00:44:50,060
That's why Dana told me Shane is ruthless.
Dana goes,

799
00:44:50,061 --> 00:44:53,120
everybody who wears sunglasses should
have inside should have that happen.

800
00:44:56,320 --> 00:45:01,280
This is after this huge fight fell apart.
What probably about right dude.

801
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:04,080
It was funny though. Yeah. But um,

802
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:06,920
it wasn't,
he wasn't wearing sunglasses.

803
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,810
Yeah. I mean I just want to clear it up
for Tony that I, like I say, I mean I,

804
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:11,520
I feel bad for them.
I really do.

805
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:15,180
I think the good news is you can come
back from that injury. That's an injury.

806
00:45:15,181 --> 00:45:18,450
You can come back at 34 especially with
the way he trains. I mean, I think he,

807
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:20,130
I think the body can come back.
It's just,

808
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:23,820
I don't know if his mind will
let him be as free as it.

809
00:45:23,821 --> 00:45:27,330
That was one of Tony's biggest assets
to the style is he was, I mean,

810
00:45:27,331 --> 00:45:29,100
he just does whatever the fuck he wants,
you know?

811
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:32,250
And now when he gets back in here, is
he going to be thinking about, is knee,

812
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:34,850
even if that's in the back of
your mind, it's still, it's,

813
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:38,100
it's limited on that type of style
that he, that he likes to fight

814
00:45:38,830 --> 00:45:40,930
maybe, or maybe you just
fucking with his head right now.

815
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:48,740
He planted some seeds. Kevin
Lee, you never know. Here's
some money to be made. Joe.

816
00:45:48,741 --> 00:45:51,470
I gotta be, I gotta
get it. I understand it

817
00:45:52,130 --> 00:45:53,360
be out for quite a while.

818
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:56,840
I would imagine he won't be able to
even really train hard for six months.

819
00:45:56,910 --> 00:46:00,860
Yeah. At least. At least. Yeah. He's
at least a year or so. Uh, I'll, I'll,

820
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:05,370
I'll let us send me when I look at
that and I see that fight and just,

821
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:09,270
you know, how much different
shit could be now. You know, uh,

822
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:12,280
head I went into that fight healthy.
Especially I think the,

823
00:46:12,281 --> 00:46:13,740
the entire division would look different,

824
00:46:13,741 --> 00:46:16,640
but I'm a correct all that in a little
bit. Let me, let me get my hands. Oh,

825
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:17,660
could be first.
Yeah.

826
00:46:17,810 --> 00:46:20,660
Well it's interesting me,
you're in the running now for sure.

827
00:46:20,661 --> 00:46:25,400
And before this fight, I think you were
a slight underdog in the Barboza fight.

828
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:28,520
Yeah. But after that
domination, I mean, you,

829
00:46:28,521 --> 00:46:32,900
you for sure more moved up and
you're in the running now 100%.

830
00:46:32,901 --> 00:46:34,010
So you got poor Yay.

831
00:46:34,011 --> 00:46:37,490
Who just looked real good against Gagey
and won that fight after getting his

832
00:46:37,491 --> 00:46:41,030
legs chewed up. Yup. Um, and
then you've got, but you know,

833
00:46:41,031 --> 00:46:43,880
poor Yay of course was knocked
out by Michael Johnson.

834
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:49,240
And then you've got you coming off of the
loss to Tony Storm the gates with this

835
00:46:49,611 --> 00:46:50,290
fight.

836
00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:54,140
And then you've got Eddie Alvarez who
look great against Justin Gagey that it's

837
00:46:54,141 --> 00:46:56,840
very hot. Yeah. And
Connor is going to jail.

838
00:46:57,620 --> 00:46:58,800
Wait,
who knows what's happened?

839
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:01,630
I think that's the x factor is what's
happening. What Kotter. Yeah. Uh,

840
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:05,560
I mean Dustin is out there. He,
he, but I just don't see, no,

841
00:47:06,730 --> 00:47:11,200
I'm speaking as it from a fan.
You know, I just don't see no, uh,

842
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:15,250
upsize today. You know what I mean? To
you fighting him? No, no, no. To, to,

843
00:47:15,270 --> 00:47:17,970
to him make a beep. I mean, they
can make it happen and it can be,

844
00:47:17,971 --> 00:47:22,230
we'll go out there and he'll smoke them.
I mean, they should be real here, but uh,

845
00:47:22,390 --> 00:47:25,420
I just don't see many
fans getting behind that.

846
00:47:25,421 --> 00:47:28,240
Just from what does [inaudible] bring
to the table that could be made already

847
00:47:28,241 --> 00:47:30,040
seen.
This is big fight right

848
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:31,600
now. I mean, just being completely honest,

849
00:47:31,601 --> 00:47:35,590
the big fire right now is Khabib and
con 100% sure. That's the big fight.

850
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:38,490
Whatever. Take five or either Madison
Square Garden. I mean, they, they can,

851
00:47:38,491 --> 00:47:39,310
they can make that happen.

852
00:47:39,310 --> 00:47:42,220
I don't think New York has ever letting
that mother fucker fuck there again.

853
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,310
I just don't think they're going to
do that. They don't play games, man.

854
00:47:45,311 --> 00:47:46,270
Then athletic commissions,

855
00:47:46,271 --> 00:47:50,050
a different commission and they're new to
MMA and that was embarrassing for them.

856
00:47:50,051 --> 00:47:53,530
I mean him throwing the fucking Dolly
and the fact that they let them get in

857
00:47:53,531 --> 00:47:56,710
there with all his boys and the whole
thing was just so thuggish and didn't,

858
00:47:56,711 --> 00:47:59,980
the thing at Bella [inaudible] happened
in was that in New York? In New Jersey,

859
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:02,670
what thing happened in Beltour where he,

860
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:06,910
where he went over and slap
Goddard and audit a cop.

861
00:48:06,930 --> 00:48:08,950
People bitches and hoes and it was that,

862
00:48:08,951 --> 00:48:12,190
I want to say that was an Ireland
or England. Was it an Ireland?

863
00:48:12,550 --> 00:48:14,710
I think it was in England.
I want to say it was in London.

864
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:19,350
Wasn't that the bell toward London Card?
I don't know.

865
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:22,750
But that got her thing was crazy.
I felt like that happened.

866
00:48:22,751 --> 00:48:26,050
Don't on the east coast too, but I mean
if that was one, neither waist too.

867
00:48:26,051 --> 00:48:31,051
It's like he just keeps fucking up with
this kind of stuff and and you know,

868
00:48:31,390 --> 00:48:35,740
no one's saying get rid of him, you know,
he's just, he's worth so much money.

869
00:48:35,741 --> 00:48:37,150
It's really fascinating.
What I was saying is,

870
00:48:37,151 --> 00:48:40,180
imagine if Ray Borg and him switch sides.

871
00:48:40,330 --> 00:48:44,350
If Ray pour it showed up with all his
boys and was screaming and yelling and

872
00:48:44,351 --> 00:48:48,760
through a Dolly at the window.
It's done. Done deal for. Yeah.

873
00:48:49,190 --> 00:48:51,820
Ray Paul Daley.
Paul Daley must be at home going,

874
00:48:54,490 --> 00:48:56,100
hey, look, it's starting phase.

875
00:48:57,150 --> 00:49:01,930
It's certain things that we just,
Kay, do you know Paul, I'm sorry,

876
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:07,740
until you get to that
stratosphere that Conor McGregor,

877
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:10,750
it's like there's so much money
to be made. That's the problem.

878
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:13,450
It's like the rules get
Bet Paul Paul Daley was,

879
00:49:13,630 --> 00:49:18,280
did was throw a punch as he was Josh
Koscheck after it didn't even connect.

880
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:22,560
That could have been sorted out.
Yeah. And you even heck, I was like,

881
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:25,290
we'll Brooks kinda got the hammer
put down on them. Dinny uh,

882
00:49:25,330 --> 00:49:28,750
after he got knocked out
and then push the ref. Uh,

883
00:49:29,230 --> 00:49:33,010
I think what that will Brooks, I'm
sorry. I don't know. I don't know.

884
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:37,210
You're looking at me funny
on it. I'm thinking, right.
It was somebody, you know,

885
00:49:37,211 --> 00:49:40,780
he got knocked out and then push the rep
right out there and it's like they put

886
00:49:40,781 --> 00:49:45,170
a lot on. Oh No, it wasn't well
books. I'm sorry it was a god.

887
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:49,090
What's that many ponder. Hmm. I
know who you're talking about.

888
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:54,970
God dammit. Who was that?
God, this is going to kill me.

889
00:49:55,150 --> 00:49:55,983
Sorry.
Yeah.

890
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:01,210
And they held them against him and he
was concussed. You know, you didn't know.

891
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:04,980
You barely know where you
at. He said, Jason, I it's,
that's what it was. Yeah. See,

892
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:06,220
great fighter too.

893
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:09,760
He's a very good fighter and when people
don't understand is that once you get

894
00:50:09,761 --> 00:50:12,910
knocked out and then you come back, you
really don't know what happened. You're,

895
00:50:12,970 --> 00:50:17,380
you're really out of it. Yeah. Who knocked
him out? It was no soft gels. Right.

896
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:22,800
So Angelo's welterweight
debut, right? 55 still.

897
00:50:22,801 --> 00:50:25,750
She had 55 still. Yeah. Yeah. But
again, he was great fighter on me.

898
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:30,320
It's just certain things that,
oh, well we just can't do Jo.

899
00:50:30,650 --> 00:50:35,060
We meaning people of color.
I don't want to say it that way.

900
00:50:35,070 --> 00:50:35,903
They can do it though.

901
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:41,300
I do think it's people with that there's
a level to the game where you are so

902
00:50:42,711 --> 00:50:46,790
valuable that you like if Conor
McGregor does a pay per view fight,

903
00:50:47,450 --> 00:50:48,710
especially if they do,

904
00:50:48,890 --> 00:50:51,230
you heard all that crazy nonsense
they're going to do with Mcgregor.

905
00:50:51,231 --> 00:50:55,230
Like no shoes. You can clinch
but no kicks, no take downs.

906
00:50:55,270 --> 00:50:59,460
Know if they ever did that. Greg going to
digital printing money, printing money,

907
00:51:00,570 --> 00:51:03,190
but so hard for them to
not take that money. But

908
00:51:03,410 --> 00:51:05,040
I mean, and it, and I don't
hold that against them.

909
00:51:05,041 --> 00:51:07,650
And I always said that about the UFC.
Do you see about the green? And I,

910
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:12,230
and I understand that and uh, that's
kind of where I'm coming from it from,

911
00:51:12,231 --> 00:51:16,460
but he, you know, it's just
consistency. Yeah. Well you,

912
00:51:16,730 --> 00:51:21,530
I think you just have to realize as a,
as a, as a black man in America really,

913
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:23,480
like there's two ways to
approach the situation.

914
00:51:23,481 --> 00:51:25,430
You need to be the victim or you
can just say it is what it is.

915
00:51:25,431 --> 00:51:27,700
That some circumstances, you know, uh,

916
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,520
by people just don't support other black
people to way to iris support the Irish,

917
00:51:31,521 --> 00:51:33,770
the Russia support. I mean, I'm
just being real with you. That's

918
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:37,900
reality is white people in America don't
support white Americans the way the

919
00:51:37,901 --> 00:51:41,770
Irish support Connor, nobody does
100% and it's an American thing.

920
00:51:41,771 --> 00:51:45,460
I mean when he was fighting,
when he was fighting Mayweather,

921
00:51:45,461 --> 00:51:48,100
did you see the fucking,
the people that were in Mandalay bay,

922
00:51:48,101 --> 00:51:50,020
which wasn't even where
the was taking place,

923
00:51:50,290 --> 00:51:53,500
the entire place was flooded
with people singing together.

924
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:57,640
When he fought dust import. Yay.
At one 78 they kept me up all for,

925
00:51:57,641 --> 00:51:59,090
I was on the undercard it up by,

926
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:02,080
it kept me up all fucking
night sitting in the MGM.

927
00:52:02,590 --> 00:52:07,460
They were running up and down the,
the, the, the halls of the MGM leads.

928
00:52:07,790 --> 00:52:12,580
The security couldn't stop them. I mean
they had to crazy to rabbit, but that's,

929
00:52:12,670 --> 00:52:13,510
that's what's gonna.

930
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:16,480
I mean obviously he had a great
performance is on top of it for sure.

931
00:52:16,510 --> 00:52:18,640
But that definitely helps.
You know what I mean?

932
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:22,420
When your first fight in
the UFC debut is in Boston.

933
00:52:22,421 --> 00:52:27,070
Nick going crazy for you
like that. You just don't see
that much. Uh, and it's sad.

934
00:52:27,071 --> 00:52:29,440
Really. Uh, you, you talk
about Floyd Mayweather,

935
00:52:29,470 --> 00:52:33,330
really how Floyd got big like that is he
had to go against the Mexicans and you

936
00:52:33,331 --> 00:52:35,950
know, he had to get them to really
hate them in order to get big.

937
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:38,440
Exactly, yes. But that's also his style.

938
00:52:38,590 --> 00:52:41,170
Whereas Connor style's very
different cause he knocks guys dead.

939
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:44,650
It's a different style. You know, like
may remember when Tyson was in his prime,

940
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:47,290
you knew no one was kind of beat them.
It was just,

941
00:52:47,291 --> 00:52:50,230
you're waiting to see the executions
where you were just a little boy at the

942
00:52:50,231 --> 00:52:54,200
time. Probably weren't even
born. My pops was like,

943
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:57,370
what time were you born in [inaudible]
92. Yeah. See Jesus Christ,

944
00:52:57,371 --> 00:53:01,630
you missed everything. Well, my positive,
they used my title. I'm a huge boxing fan,

945
00:53:01,631 --> 00:53:05,490
so you know, I go back, I would have
92. That's a huge boxing fan. Yeah.

946
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:08,030
Just all of these, the UFC
actually, so that's crazy right.

947
00:53:08,031 --> 00:53:12,310
It pretty much a year after you
were born. It started. Yeah man.

948
00:53:12,311 --> 00:53:16,480
But the Tyson days, he was the biggest
paper you draw it, but it was really just,

949
00:53:16,481 --> 00:53:19,060
you were watching an execution
and there was also like,

950
00:53:19,061 --> 00:53:21,070
people were thinking like, man,
is this going to be worth it?

951
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:22,450
How long has this one going to last?

952
00:53:22,810 --> 00:53:26,160
He's still, but he's still, he was, he
had to be the a little bit, you know,

953
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:29,780
and that's the every, and it, I mean, I,

954
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:34,190
it sucks to say it was just like
every real big black fighter.

955
00:53:34,191 --> 00:53:37,260
Is it usually the villain, you know, and,
and that, that's the way that it was not,

956
00:53:37,290 --> 00:53:40,230
but that's not American. He's, and he's
British. That's different, you know,

957
00:53:40,231 --> 00:53:44,550
he's totally different. Totally
different. Totally different atmosphere.

958
00:53:44,551 --> 00:53:44,851
And I mean,

959
00:53:44,851 --> 00:53:49,851
this was the last time we had a really
loved African American fighter in

960
00:53:50,521 --> 00:53:54,270
America. I mean, they're there,
they're out there. I mean,

961
00:53:54,271 --> 00:53:57,450
for sure people love roadshows.
Peter Jones love.

962
00:53:57,710 --> 00:54:00,520
And people love Muhammad
Ali after, uh, you know,

963
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:03,870
but even Roy Johnson Shit for
being cocky. Oh, for sure.

964
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:08,940
Because he was so dominant. But that's
the culture though. You gotta be cocky.

965
00:54:08,941 --> 00:54:10,500
You gotta be,
you gotta be all those things.

966
00:54:10,501 --> 00:54:13,740
Like even the way I talk a lot of shit.
But that's just,

967
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:16,930
that's just because that's the culture.
Like that's what I do. I mean, well,

968
00:54:16,950 --> 00:54:20,970
it's also an effective mind,
mind games strategy,

969
00:54:21,030 --> 00:54:25,560
like a guy who's talking shit to you.
It makes you more anxious,

970
00:54:25,770 --> 00:54:30,660
more nervous, more emotions,
more everything. Certain guys,

971
00:54:30,661 --> 00:54:33,480
you know, there's certain guys that
you can play that too. Like I said,

972
00:54:33,481 --> 00:54:36,930
everybody's got like those three
categories, you know, with athletes,

973
00:54:36,931 --> 00:54:40,220
especially athletes and competitors,
you know, they Kinda, you know,

974
00:54:40,230 --> 00:54:44,750
get more shooken up by stuff like that.
Fall fire ideas. He don't give a fuck.

975
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:50,010
Like, he likes me. I like
it a little bit more.

976
00:54:50,070 --> 00:54:52,610
Connor, you could tell he
likes it a little bit more. Uh,

977
00:54:52,650 --> 00:54:57,390
it gets my mind off the actual fight
itself because that's what we grew up like

978
00:54:57,391 --> 00:55:00,480
talking shit, you know, so it's, some
guys do, it rattles them. You know,

979
00:55:00,481 --> 00:55:04,680
the best I've ever seen the best response
to someone. Shit-Talking Rose Nama.

980
00:55:04,681 --> 00:55:08,190
Eunice. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. She,
she massive, full dark master full.

981
00:55:08,191 --> 00:55:12,100
She went like that like a month. I'm
a huge role is fair. She's, yeah,

982
00:55:12,690 --> 00:55:15,720
she's dope.
Might be the best looking girl in the UFC.

983
00:55:15,721 --> 00:55:18,540
And she shaves her fucking head and never
wears makeup. She doesn't give a fuck.

984
00:55:19,170 --> 00:55:23,940
I mean it's crazy. Yeah. And she, I mean,
and a phenomenal, phenomenal fighter.

985
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:24,810
I,

986
00:55:24,810 --> 00:55:28,770
but just when she was standing in front
of Yolanda and she was citing the Lord's

987
00:55:28,771 --> 00:55:29,540
prayer,

988
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:34,200
gangster man coming to get you
and the boogie man and she's like,

989
00:55:34,201 --> 00:55:38,980
our father in heaven, hallowed be thy
name of gangster shit. You ever light?

990
00:55:39,190 --> 00:55:42,990
It's like crazy. She made me
nervous. I'm a big fan of next door.

991
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:44,490
That's where the thing with, uh, you know,

992
00:55:44,491 --> 00:55:48,270
people look at my style even of the way
I promoted her and all the talk fights

993
00:55:48,290 --> 00:55:52,470
and, you know, Talk Shit or whatever.
Uh, but there's so many ways to do it.

994
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:56,160
You know, there's so many ways to like
entertain at hit, have fun with it.

995
00:55:56,161 --> 00:55:59,970
You don't always have to be almost smack
the shit out of your Mama and all that.

996
00:55:59,971 --> 00:56:02,880
Right. You know, it's, there's
so many different ways you get,

997
00:56:02,881 --> 00:56:06,500
you can not say anything.
It'd be come off just as fucking is.

998
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:10,440
You know the dude this screaming from
across the room with there is a pressure,

999
00:56:10,441 --> 00:56:10,860
right?

1000
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:14,910
Isn't there a pressure on fighters to sal
and hype fights to talk a lot of shit.

1001
00:56:14,911 --> 00:56:19,170
I mean, you see seen Colby Covington
taking it off the deep end. He goes,

1002
00:56:19,530 --> 00:56:22,050
he goes so crazy. I don't even
think they let him go to Brazil.

1003
00:56:22,370 --> 00:56:24,640
Like when I heard he was
gonna Fight Dos Anjos

1004
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:26,470
in Brazil, I was like, no, Colby.

1005
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,170
I was thinking of reaching out and
telling people like to call it,

1006
00:56:29,171 --> 00:56:33,160
bring your own water, whatever you do. I
mean, I guess he's doing his thing. He,

1007
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:35,980
he's still winning fights.
Yeah. So at the end of the day,

1008
00:56:36,490 --> 00:56:40,000
that's what really matters is that
he's winning fights. But yeah,

1009
00:56:40,001 --> 00:56:44,350
I mean that's got us talking about him.
He's got us talking about that too.

1010
00:56:44,530 --> 00:56:48,160
But that style on me is, is that should
get played out and you could just,

1011
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:52,150
you could just tell it when it,
when it's forced is not good.

1012
00:56:52,151 --> 00:56:52,984
You know what I mean?

1013
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:56,280
He just goes, he goes against
people. He doesn't have to, like,

1014
00:56:56,281 --> 00:56:57,930
he was talking some shit about Jon Jones.

1015
00:56:58,470 --> 00:57:01,410
Jon Jones will smack you in your fucking
face and there's not much you're going

1016
00:57:01,411 --> 00:57:02,280
to be able to do about it.

1017
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:05,820
One day you might be in front of him and
then when are you going to do, you know,

1018
00:57:05,821 --> 00:57:08,700
I mean just that you're not
even fighting Jon Jones.

1019
00:57:08,701 --> 00:57:09,870
Why you talking Shit about John?

1020
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:13,330
Yeah. I don't make any sense. I don't
know a couple people, even even females,

1021
00:57:13,331 --> 00:57:14,730
like he started to, I
mean, I guess he's, he,

1022
00:57:14,731 --> 00:57:16,660
he's just trying to get the
noise running or whatever.

1023
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:18,730
I just think it's so many
different ways to do it. That's,

1024
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:21,730
that's like the most primitive way of,
you know,

1025
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:25,210
kind of trying to sell yourself and
sell a fight. It's like so many ways.

1026
00:57:25,211 --> 00:57:30,210
Like even me, like I came up with a lot
of the shit that I started doing it.

1027
00:57:30,211 --> 00:57:33,220
I just like kind of came up with, you
know, like in the moment. Yeah. Just,

1028
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:37,750
well before the, the, the, the, the
first big one was the [inaudible] thing,

1029
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:42,340
you know, where I kind of hit him at the
press conference. Uh, but going into that,

1030
00:57:43,450 --> 00:57:47,650
my mindset wasn't like all let me,

1031
00:57:47,890 --> 00:57:52,090
you know, talk as much shit as I can
about them, you know, or let me, you know,

1032
00:57:52,190 --> 00:57:55,660
jump up and down and all
this, you know, it just was,

1033
00:57:56,050 --> 00:58:00,370
I did have that I wanted to stand out,
not necessarily that I want to entertain.

1034
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,340
I just was like, I'm on, I wanted to stay.

1035
00:58:02,350 --> 00:58:05,890
I'm sitting behind fucking Jon Jones and
Daniel Cormier like I'm like a kid in a

1036
00:58:05,891 --> 00:58:09,460
candy store, you know? Uh, so I just,

1037
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:12,860
I wanted to stand out as much as possible.
And you know,

1038
00:58:13,470 --> 00:58:16,020
now the dom had a few of these big fights,
right?

1039
00:58:16,021 --> 00:58:18,960
The Kia sulfite was a high profile fight
and then of course the 25 was a very

1040
00:58:18,961 --> 00:58:21,870
high profile. And then this last
Barboza fight was a real big fight.

1041
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:26,670
Do you feel like now you've like settled
more into the fact that not only do you

1042
00:58:26,671 --> 00:58:29,580
do, do you belong here,
you deserve to be here,

1043
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:31,410
but you're more comfortable being here.

1044
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:35,460
Yeah, there's a, there's that saying
like the fake it till you make it

1045
00:58:37,150 --> 00:58:40,130
hyper real,
like that's not a joke in it.

1046
00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:41,390
When did you feel like you were fee?

1047
00:58:41,410 --> 00:58:44,260
We obviously you would never really
faking it because you were winning fights.

1048
00:58:44,470 --> 00:58:48,130
I exaggerate. It is her, you know,
like I exaggerated shorty, this shit.

1049
00:58:48,131 --> 00:58:49,720
Like I was having fun with it,

1050
00:58:49,721 --> 00:58:54,670
but I was kind of learning on the job
too because like doing interviews and

1051
00:58:54,671 --> 00:58:57,580
stuff like that, it takes some,
it's, it's hard to get to your level.

1052
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:01,480
Like you are very likely I listen to
your show all the time. Like I love it.

1053
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:04,360
Thank you. But you are like
very good at it, you know?

1054
00:59:04,361 --> 00:59:08,530
And it takes a long time to do that. I
had to kind of learn on the job. So yeah,

1055
00:59:08,531 --> 00:59:12,100
I would exaggerate a little bit
too much here and there. But, uh,

1056
00:59:12,430 --> 00:59:17,430
the fake it till you make it thing like
I think it's a lot of people hear that

1057
00:59:17,801 --> 00:59:22,010
and they like take it, take it like
negatively all the time. You know,

1058
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:25,320
I always heard that not to
get positive, you know, uh,

1059
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:28,430
I've read George Saint Pierre his
book and he talked about that a lot.

1060
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:32,450
He texted me two days before this fight
with Barboza and he was talking about,

1061
00:59:32,451 --> 00:59:35,540
you know, giving me some tips
and pointers and all that.

1062
00:59:35,541 --> 00:59:37,790
But the last thing he said to me was,
you know,

1063
00:59:37,850 --> 00:59:40,460
you're going to have that fear
when you go before you go in there,

1064
00:59:40,461 --> 00:59:42,980
but once you get in there, your body's
just going to turn the autopilot.

1065
00:59:43,130 --> 00:59:45,680
Just fake it till you make it fake
the confidence until you make it.

1066
00:59:46,370 --> 00:59:49,950
That's how he approaches it. That's
interesting. That's interesting. Fight.

1067
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:54,350
What it was is like I said, going
into that press conference especially,

1068
00:59:54,351 --> 00:59:58,040
I wanted it to stand out and through the
rest of my life in Detroit especially,

1069
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:02,060
I was always taught like, don't stand
out as much as you can. Like I was like,

1070
01:00:02,070 --> 01:00:05,930
I was like stay low and keep moving.
Chill. Like keep your head now like that,

1071
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:08,790
you know, don't focus business businesses,
done folks, business, you know,

1072
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:12,020
I always stayed on what I'm doing,
you know, always kind of had a vision,

1073
01:00:12,230 --> 01:00:14,540
always had to go.
So it,

1074
01:00:15,110 --> 01:00:20,110
my opposite was to stand out so I
had to kind of fake it till I am not

1075
01:00:21,261 --> 01:00:23,720
necessarily fake it till you make it,
fake it til I became it,

1076
01:00:24,050 --> 01:00:24,860
you know what I'm saying?

1077
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:29,840
And I think it was right after the Tony
fight where I was like maybe the two

1078
01:00:29,841 --> 01:00:33,950
months it took me to get over it.
At that moment I was like, man,

1079
01:00:33,990 --> 01:00:38,420
I really like to have that confidence
to to, you know, I do have like,

1080
01:00:38,430 --> 01:00:41,960
I don't have to fake it. You know what
I'm saying? The Tony that Tony Fight,

1081
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:45,920
I mean your, your podcast
too. I mean you'll park has,

1082
01:00:45,921 --> 01:00:49,070
has been huge to me.
I mean this and it's,

1083
01:00:49,490 --> 01:00:53,510
it's hard for me to really explain
it. You know, when me just growing up,

1084
01:00:53,511 --> 01:00:55,550
like I didn't have a lot of confidence,
you know,

1085
01:00:55,551 --> 01:00:58,580
like people see me and see me in
interviews and they just think that just,

1086
01:00:59,000 --> 01:00:59,840
that's how it was.

1087
01:01:00,170 --> 01:01:05,170
But I would lose a lot of my wrestling
matches as a kid just because I thought

1088
01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:06,823
that,

1089
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:12,280
and this might like alienator alienates
some people and it might sound like off,

1090
01:01:12,591 --> 01:01:17,120
but it's just the way I grew up is
the white boys above eight mile,

1091
01:01:17,630 --> 01:01:21,500
you know, they got the money that
they're working harder than you,

1092
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:26,570
they're better than you. So that was
kind of like my mentality kind of.

1093
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:29,690
Even when I started wrestling and like
these kids start wrestling with your five,

1094
01:01:29,691 --> 01:01:34,350
I started wanting to 16 and they
just would beat me and then be like,

1095
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:36,950
I couldn't even, I wouldn't even
really compete with them, you know,

1096
01:01:37,370 --> 01:01:42,210
it took me to go to
college, uh, B because I,

1097
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:47,020
that was my first real explosion
of white people. That's how,

1098
01:01:47,310 --> 01:01:49,990
like I obviously knew white
people went out to get, you know,

1099
01:01:49,991 --> 01:01:53,750
we the teachers and stuff, you
know, but nobody around my same age,

1100
01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:56,290
you know what I'm saying?
So when I got around and there,

1101
01:01:56,291 --> 01:01:58,850
there's one school in particular,
Detroit Catholic Central,

1102
01:01:58,940 --> 01:02:03,460
they were number one school in, in, in
Michigan at the time, but they were, uh,

1103
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:07,040
so in Detroit, every mile is, is numbered.

1104
01:02:07,570 --> 01:02:09,650
I was born and raised
pretty much all seven mile,

1105
01:02:10,850 --> 01:02:14,390
eight mile is like the divider
between the suburbs and the city.

1106
01:02:14,750 --> 01:02:17,670
These kids were like on 26 miles. So they
were like, wait, he'll tell like with,

1107
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:21,300
you know, rich regional are,
uh, so I just, I don't know,

1108
01:02:21,301 --> 01:02:23,670
for some reason I just didn't
have the confidence. Uh,

1109
01:02:24,180 --> 01:02:27,840
but when I got around them and I started
living in kind of training together

1110
01:02:27,841 --> 01:02:31,110
every day and I realized, I'm
like, we all the same, you know,

1111
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:35,550
like he works as just as hard as I
can see him every day, you know, he's,

1112
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:39,000
I see him going, it's a class and
I see them going through it too.

1113
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:43,200
Is Allison it that moment gave me
the confidence to be like, okay,

1114
01:02:43,201 --> 01:02:46,500
I can't compete with them. W W
W with other people, you know,

1115
01:02:46,501 --> 01:02:48,810
I can't compete with anybody.
Really.

1116
01:02:49,170 --> 01:02:52,440
Your podcast was like the
next step to that, you know,

1117
01:02:52,441 --> 01:02:54,090
that was me at the collegiate level.

1118
01:02:54,510 --> 01:02:58,050
The of the first podcast I heard
from you was the Lance Armstrong one.

1119
01:02:58,510 --> 01:03:03,210
And I was like, this is
like world level, you know?

1120
01:03:03,630 --> 01:03:06,870
And when I hear him talking, I hear
him talk so candidly and I'm like, oh,

1121
01:03:06,871 --> 01:03:09,720
he's just a normal dude. You
know what I mean? He's just,

1122
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:12,600
I guess in my head I didn't
have that before. You know?

1123
01:03:12,601 --> 01:03:16,530
And it's like we all the same and that
really has allowed me to go over to

1124
01:03:16,531 --> 01:03:18,840
Ireland and compete to go down
to Brazil and get Pete to,

1125
01:03:18,990 --> 01:03:22,470
to fight the best kick boxer in the world
and not have that and still had that

1126
01:03:22,471 --> 01:03:23,790
same confidence. You know
what I'm saying? Right.

1127
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:24,710
I see what you're saying.

1128
01:03:24,710 --> 01:03:29,370
Like you just hearing people talk and
realizing that we're all just human. Yeah,

1129
01:03:29,510 --> 01:03:33,650
yeah, yeah. But all the sudden you
see some superstar and whatever,

1130
01:03:33,740 --> 01:03:36,500
whatever their field is,
whether it's a musician or whatever,

1131
01:03:36,501 --> 01:03:39,970
you just assume that person has got to
be like a different thing than you. This,

1132
01:03:40,490 --> 01:03:42,980
you know, if you see Mick
Jagger or something like that,

1133
01:03:43,340 --> 01:03:46,970
that gets gotta be a different thing than
me. Yeah. He's not the same thing as me.

1134
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:48,980
And, and the thing with, uh,

1135
01:03:49,070 --> 01:03:53,180
and I started the Hashtag like 25 to life
and all that be mostly because the way

1136
01:03:53,181 --> 01:03:57,140
I grew up, I didn't get to
see many successful people.
You know what I'm saying?

1137
01:03:57,141 --> 01:04:01,280
I didn't have him. I, it's, it's,
uh, nobody ever told me, Oh,

1138
01:04:01,281 --> 01:04:04,240
you can't do this. You know what I'm
saying? But nobody ever told me. Yeah.

1139
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:05,000
Could either.

1140
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,850
And nobody showed you other people
that were doing it right around you,

1141
01:04:07,851 --> 01:04:08,930
where you could learn from them,

1142
01:04:09,060 --> 01:04:12,390
had no examples. You know,
the only examples, literally,
only examples I had was,

1143
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:16,880
was the dope man. You know, the,
the, the Jag Boys, you know, the,

1144
01:04:16,890 --> 01:04:18,330
the pimps and you know,

1145
01:04:18,331 --> 01:04:22,590
you didn't really have much else to
really look forward to. So when I was,

1146
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:25,830
I thought when I was 25 like burning
him now, I thought for sure I'm

1147
01:04:25,830 --> 01:04:28,290
just going to be in
jail like that is that,

1148
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:31,500
that's one of the most important points
when people talk about people being able

1149
01:04:31,501 --> 01:04:34,470
to pull themselves up by their bootstraps
and they should just get a job and

1150
01:04:34,471 --> 01:04:38,400
they should just do this. Like you say
that because you grew up around that,

1151
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:40,830
but if you didn't grow up
around anybody doing that,

1152
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:44,340
like your feeling that you feeling
the way you felt when you were around

1153
01:04:44,341 --> 01:04:46,410
wrestlers that had been
competing their whole lives.

1154
01:04:46,411 --> 01:04:47,940
You didn't feel like you belong there.

1155
01:04:48,060 --> 01:04:50,490
You didn't have any of
that at success around you.

1156
01:04:50,790 --> 01:04:55,790
That's that is one of the most important
things in life is surrounding yourself

1157
01:04:55,801 --> 01:04:59,850
with positive people. It's so difficult
to do if you're in a bad place.

1158
01:05:00,090 --> 01:05:03,450
If you grew up in a bad neighborhood
and you're surrounded by bad people,

1159
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:08,780
very few people have the vision to see
past that and they have no examples.

1160
01:05:09,150 --> 01:05:12,300
Yeah, I mean you see someone on
television again, you're going to think,

1161
01:05:12,301 --> 01:05:15,240
that's not me. Like, still to
this day when I meet a rock star,

1162
01:05:15,241 --> 01:05:18,100
I still get word of it. I still
get weirded out. Doesn't matter how

1163
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:20,530
famous you get, you get weirded
out and run other famous people.

1164
01:05:21,130 --> 01:05:23,130
They just don't seem like you,
you know?

1165
01:05:23,270 --> 01:05:27,200
And especially when you kind of grow
up in that environment and you know,

1166
01:05:27,201 --> 01:05:31,570
is you don't really, you know, you
see a doctor on TV and you don't,

1167
01:05:31,630 --> 01:05:34,720
you just don't connect with
it, you know, at least for me,

1168
01:05:34,721 --> 01:05:38,140
like that's what I wanted to be. I wanted
to be a doctor, uh, first, but I didn't,

1169
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:40,180
you know, I didn't live in
neighborhoods with doctors. You know,

1170
01:05:40,181 --> 01:05:41,950
I didn't meet a doctor when I did.

1171
01:05:41,951 --> 01:05:44,710
He was like some old dude and it's like
he didn't really give a fuck. Like,

1172
01:05:44,750 --> 01:05:47,930
he's like, you know, your mom, you know,
you're on Medicaid motherfucker. Like,

1173
01:05:48,060 --> 01:05:52,540
you know, take it 35 bucks and
get the fuck off. But, you know,

1174
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:54,450
uh, Eh, I,

1175
01:05:54,470 --> 01:05:59,470
I think that is a big point of it is just
to have somebody to tell you that you

1176
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:03,280
can, you know what I'm
saying? So at least I tried.

1177
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:05,930
And then to see people around
you that are working hard,

1178
01:06:06,450 --> 01:06:10,900
succeeding and emulate them
and learn from them people,

1179
01:06:11,020 --> 01:06:14,670
we don't exist in a vacuum. We
exist in communities. And that's,

1180
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:18,190
this is something that it's very difficult
to people for people to understand if

1181
01:06:18,191 --> 01:06:19,420
they're in a good community,

1182
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:21,940
if you're in a good community
or if you're in a bad community,

1183
01:06:21,941 --> 01:06:25,210
it's difficult to understand to the
value of a good community, 100%.

1184
01:06:25,211 --> 01:06:29,800
And I think one of the biggest things
is just that integration is like really

1185
01:06:29,801 --> 01:06:30,371
important.
Like,

1186
01:06:30,371 --> 01:06:33,220
and I'm starting to see that the more
I'm getting out and kind of seeing the

1187
01:06:33,221 --> 01:06:38,050
world and seeing the way things run and
kind of comparing that to the way I grew

1188
01:06:38,051 --> 01:06:42,070
up. And it's just like there
was no, there was so much.

1189
01:06:42,130 --> 01:06:45,010
It's just seems so segregated to me.
Uh,

1190
01:06:45,130 --> 01:06:48,250
which is a weird term to use
and this day and age, you know?

1191
01:06:48,251 --> 01:06:51,520
But it just did like literally not the,

1192
01:06:52,090 --> 01:06:56,200
I remember because my mom, she did a
good job of keeping us in good schools,

1193
01:06:56,201 --> 01:06:58,690
you know, so our school was on 10
mile, which was in the suburbs.

1194
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:03,190
I went to Southfield high. Uh, I remember
a couple of times, me and my brother,

1195
01:07:03,460 --> 01:07:05,050
we would try and walk to the school.

1196
01:07:05,170 --> 01:07:10,170
So you had to walk pass through eight
mile and a policeman had pulled over three

1197
01:07:10,181 --> 01:07:10,751
or four times,

1198
01:07:10,751 --> 01:07:14,340
picked us up in the car and took us back
across and they dropped us off and just

1199
01:07:14,341 --> 01:07:17,770
like you don't, and it's like we go
to school there, you know what I mean?

1200
01:07:17,771 --> 01:07:22,320
Like they didn't believe you and
not a [inaudible]. We, you know, we,

1201
01:07:22,450 --> 01:07:26,140
we were also like, the best I can give is
probably starting to solve it. You know,

1202
01:07:26,950 --> 01:07:30,210
you're up to no good. Yeah, yeah,
we do. But you know, I have to,

1203
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:34,030
but I feel like that integration,
if it's just, it's just really,

1204
01:07:34,031 --> 01:07:36,360
really important and I'm starting to
see that the more I'm getting out and

1205
01:07:36,361 --> 01:07:39,880
learning in the world, it's all
the same. Literally all the same.

1206
01:07:39,910 --> 01:07:44,800
All the same like, and everything
for sure, but we're all just people,

1207
01:07:44,830 --> 01:07:45,470
you know,
and,

1208
01:07:45,470 --> 01:07:49,210
and sometimes having all those advantages
when you're young is a disadvantage

1209
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:53,530
because the hungriest most determined
people are the people that had nothing at

1210
01:07:53,531 --> 01:07:56,790
one point in their life when they
understand what nothing means. Yeah. Yeah.

1211
01:07:56,810 --> 01:08:01,030
And I mean, I think I attribute that to
a lot of my success and that's what I,

1212
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:03,550
I always keep in the back of my head,
you know,

1213
01:08:03,551 --> 01:08:07,660
it's especially going through college,
like such a rough, like, you know,

1214
01:08:08,470 --> 01:08:12,280
20 bucks a week as a vibe. Delpha. And
I was, I was fighting for the time.

1215
01:08:12,281 --> 01:08:15,980
I was taking 15 credits.
Uh, I was wrestling still at

1216
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:19,850
the same time, like, and I just was on the
hustle. I was moving up the grind. Yeah.

1217
01:08:19,851 --> 01:08:24,480
Super Grind, but on nothing.
Like, you know, I had like a, uh,

1218
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:26,210
1996,

1219
01:08:26,290 --> 01:08:31,290
a Thunderbird would like 300,000 miles
and I was Bernadette Shit over here every

1220
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:35,900
day. Uh, but I keep that in the back of
my head. Even now. Like, I don't, I don't,

1221
01:08:36,110 --> 01:08:38,030
I don't never get comfortable,
never get contented.

1222
01:08:38,030 --> 01:08:41,900
When I think about that with having kids
because I have young kids and I think

1223
01:08:42,110 --> 01:08:46,070
my kids have never known like
that kind of financial struggle.

1224
01:08:46,270 --> 01:08:48,200
Like I think financial
struggle in particular,

1225
01:08:48,201 --> 01:08:52,170
something that just to this day I still
think about being broken. It just, it, it,

1226
01:08:52,340 --> 01:08:56,550
it motivates me. Like I'll, I'll
never slack off because I just,

1227
01:08:56,660 --> 01:08:59,900
I think if you haven't,
but also like when you have kids,

1228
01:08:59,901 --> 01:09:01,160
you don't want your kids to struggle.

1229
01:09:01,161 --> 01:09:04,400
It's like all my friends that are
interesting, all I've fucked up lives,

1230
01:09:04,460 --> 01:09:08,210
all of them, everyone,
everything went crazy.

1231
01:09:08,390 --> 01:09:11,890
Everyone was fucking abused
or someone was an asshole.

1232
01:09:11,980 --> 01:09:14,860
The alcoholics or drug addicts and
their family. Yeah, yeah, yeah,

1233
01:09:14,890 --> 01:09:15,140
yeah.

1234
01:09:15,140 --> 01:09:18,040
They're on the fun ones and they're all
my favorite people and they use it as

1235
01:09:18,041 --> 01:09:20,440
motivation to learn the
world and learn things.

1236
01:09:20,441 --> 01:09:22,410
And that's what I kind of did as a,
as a kid.

1237
01:09:22,610 --> 01:09:26,410
I kind of took a look
around when I was maybe 15.

1238
01:09:26,610 --> 01:09:27,930
I was probably like the,

1239
01:09:27,990 --> 01:09:31,130
the time that really clicked for
me when I found him in May and I,

1240
01:09:31,131 --> 01:09:34,090
and I kind of saw that this
is what I want to do. Uh,

1241
01:09:34,390 --> 01:09:35,710
that's when it kinda
clicked how she's like,

1242
01:09:35,711 --> 01:09:39,220
I don't want to be around like light
the rest of these motherfuckers here.

1243
01:09:39,460 --> 01:09:43,900
How'd you get started? Where'd
you, where'd you find a
good gym? So when I was 15,

1244
01:09:43,901 --> 01:09:44,890
I just,
uh,

1245
01:09:46,060 --> 01:09:50,200
I saw George Saint Pierre and Bj Penn
was the first time I'd seen a fight.

1246
01:09:50,201 --> 01:09:51,660
And you know,

1247
01:09:51,730 --> 01:09:55,390
there was no MMA gyms
or anything like that.

1248
01:09:55,420 --> 01:09:57,460
I had just went out for
the rest of the team at,

1249
01:09:57,500 --> 01:10:00,730
at the high school because I was
already there and all that. So, uh,

1250
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:06,190
I didn't start really getting into MMA
and until I came back from college or one

1251
01:10:06,191 --> 01:10:07,600
year from college and,
uh,

1252
01:10:07,601 --> 01:10:11,140
I wanted to sign up for a Jujitsu
tournament and I had never trained it or

1253
01:10:11,141 --> 01:10:14,500
anything. I went and signed up for a
Jujitsu tournament and the guy's like,

1254
01:10:14,620 --> 01:10:17,530
oh yeah, we do some fights on, on the,
the sermon was Sunday. And he was like,

1255
01:10:17,531 --> 01:10:21,060
we do some fights on Saturday and uh,
there's nobody, uh, you know, for this,

1256
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:23,530
for this guy. I was like, fuck
that motherfucker right now. Like,

1257
01:10:23,531 --> 01:10:28,300
and I never tried before. I just wrestled.
So I was like, yeah, please sign.

1258
01:10:28,340 --> 01:10:32,220
It was like Tuesday. I had,
how old are you? 18. Yeah.

1259
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:35,730
So I just showed up, you
know, no mouthpiece. No,

1260
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:37,900
I didn't know you needed a
mouthpiece or cup or anything,

1261
01:10:37,901 --> 01:10:41,370
like have a car yet to do that fall.
It was like 26 and I just went, well,

1262
01:10:41,410 --> 01:10:43,730
they went to a Walmart,
uh, because as I've,

1263
01:10:44,170 --> 01:10:46,810
as I'm getting ready to step into
the octagon to go, it was like,

1264
01:10:46,990 --> 01:10:49,380
where's your mouthpiece and
cup? And I was like, what?

1265
01:10:49,510 --> 01:10:54,000
Like prepare for a wrestling match, I
guess. And they ran through Walmart,

1266
01:10:54,020 --> 01:10:55,380
grabbed me one it,
I'll beat the fuck out it.

1267
01:10:58,950 --> 01:11:02,200
Did you have any striking at all?
What I saw on the TV?

1268
01:11:04,570 --> 01:11:09,570
Oh my God, I didn't really have real
training until I got into the, uh,

1269
01:11:09,580 --> 01:11:13,830
until I got over to, I mean,
I trained hard, uh, with,

1270
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:15,090
with one of my coaches.
I had,

1271
01:11:15,091 --> 01:11:19,470
Sean did say he was my first true coaching
in Michigan and we trained hard, uh,

1272
01:11:19,471 --> 01:11:21,330
and he, he showed me a lot
of things. He was a boxer,

1273
01:11:21,331 --> 01:11:25,680
so he showed me a lot of things. Um, but
I didn't really have a real, you know,

1274
01:11:25,681 --> 01:11:28,860
I was still a full time student and when
I got the call from the UFC, you know,

1275
01:11:28,861 --> 01:11:33,060
I got the call in like December and
finals. I got the call like finals week.

1276
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:34,770
And I was like, well shit, let me,

1277
01:11:34,950 --> 01:11:37,470
let me go ahead and bust out
these vitals and then, you know,

1278
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:41,280
I'm done with this shit. Uh, and then
the fight was like late January, I think,

1279
01:11:41,281 --> 01:11:44,490
or so. So I was like a full
time student when I took the,

1280
01:11:44,610 --> 01:11:47,040
I was taking 15 credits as a med student.

1281
01:11:47,041 --> 01:11:50,450
So you really only had like a couple of
years of striking at that point. Yeah,

1282
01:11:50,451 --> 01:11:54,090
yeah. If that, yeah. You know, a lot
of wrestling and a lot of, you know,

1283
01:11:54,210 --> 01:11:56,310
I didn't really get it really good.

1284
01:11:56,311 --> 01:11:58,680
It's a striking until I got over to
Vegas and work with Dewey Cooper.

1285
01:11:58,760 --> 01:12:00,740
That makes it even more impressive man.

1286
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:04,580
You know that you've been able to make
such a big leap in such a short amount of

1287
01:12:04,581 --> 01:12:07,370
time. I mean that's your were
talking about like seven years that,

1288
01:12:07,371 --> 01:12:09,110
I mean that's really,
that's really crazy

1289
01:12:09,110 --> 01:12:12,070
consistency. I think consistency
is the key. Like I love,

1290
01:12:12,190 --> 01:12:16,010
I actually love this shit.
Like I got the most fights, uh,

1291
01:12:16,011 --> 01:12:19,490
in the lightweight division
since my debut, the anybody else.

1292
01:12:19,491 --> 01:12:23,690
And it's just cause I stay consistent. I
keep my body healthy, I keep showing up.

1293
01:12:23,691 --> 01:12:27,260
And you know, the more you see things
coming at you, the, the, the better gift.

1294
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:27,800
You know,

1295
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:31,060
that's definitely a factor. But I
think it's also intelligence, the,

1296
01:12:31,061 --> 01:12:33,620
the understanding of your also,
like there's,

1297
01:12:33,650 --> 01:12:35,600
there's different kinds
of intelligence too.

1298
01:12:35,601 --> 01:12:40,310
And there's intelligence of like how to
get good at things. And some people just,

1299
01:12:40,730 --> 01:12:42,650
I don't know if it's a physical thing,

1300
01:12:42,860 --> 01:12:47,630
if their body works better or if it's
just that they are able to see how someone

1301
01:12:47,631 --> 01:12:51,920
does something and listen to instruction
and then break it down and put it

1302
01:12:51,921 --> 01:12:55,100
together. But I've seen in little kids,
man, when I used to teach little kids,

1303
01:12:55,740 --> 01:12:58,910
there was little kids that weren't even
like physically town does not like the,

1304
01:12:59,090 --> 01:13:00,940
they were gymnasts.
They could do back flips and shit.

1305
01:13:00,950 --> 01:13:02,210
They do crazy shit with their body.

1306
01:13:02,450 --> 01:13:05,390
There's some kids where you would
show him like, see this foot,

1307
01:13:05,391 --> 01:13:07,730
this foot's got pivot, and then
you're, it's all about your hips.

1308
01:13:07,940 --> 01:13:10,370
And they would see you and they would go,
okay.

1309
01:13:10,371 --> 01:13:14,110
And then you'd see them breaking it down.
And then other kids, oh, the fucking,

1310
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:16,000
they just couldn't see
what you were doing there.

1311
01:13:16,001 --> 01:13:18,230
Throw their feet up in their air,
their foot would never pivot.

1312
01:13:18,470 --> 01:13:20,590
They're putting all this pressure on the
knee. Like, what? Whoa, Whoa, whoa. Don't,

1313
01:13:20,630 --> 01:13:22,760
don't do that. Don't do that.
You got to turn your hips,

1314
01:13:22,910 --> 01:13:24,140
your foot's got to go with it.

1315
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:28,040
And then some people just could
mirror you see in Jujitsu too.

1316
01:13:28,110 --> 01:13:32,460
Yeah, yeah, for sure. Big Time and Jujitsu
and grapple and especially, you know,

1317
01:13:32,470 --> 01:13:36,180
grappling, wrestling it. They just see
it. I think it's, I think it's come,

1318
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:39,490
like you said, it's a,
it's an intelligence there.

1319
01:13:39,570 --> 01:13:43,830
There's people think it's just a brute, no
thing that you're doing. But it's, it's,

1320
01:13:43,860 --> 01:13:47,190
it's very, you know, at least
from me, like our approach,
it kind of like a science.

1321
01:13:47,191 --> 01:13:52,050
It's almost is a, B, c, d, e
you know, I go from here. If,
if, if not, then I branch off.

1322
01:13:52,051 --> 01:13:57,051
I have different systems for every
kind of a situation that will arise,

1323
01:13:57,331 --> 01:14:01,680
but I, I kind of approach
it like a scientist. Like I
went to school if a biomed,

1324
01:14:01,700 --> 01:14:04,560
like that kind of stuff interests me,
you know what I mean?

1325
01:14:04,561 --> 01:14:08,850
Like there's art to it. There's a,
there's a huge, huge portion of it.

1326
01:14:08,851 --> 01:14:12,040
That's our expression. Yeah. The
expression part is his art and I

1327
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:16,030
think it's one of the pure as art forms
fighting this, make sure that there is,

1328
01:14:16,060 --> 01:14:19,540
you know, if someone looks great
doing it, that is like a form of art.

1329
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:21,710
Oh 100% a hundred percent I think it's,
I,

1330
01:14:21,711 --> 01:14:25,330
I get so irritated whenever somebody
says is not there because I get so

1331
01:14:25,331 --> 01:14:29,750
irritated. Like, did you see Beltour
when Gaston Bolanos landed that uh,

1332
01:14:30,130 --> 01:14:33,820
insane spinning elbow. It's like one of
the greatest spinning elbows of all time.

1333
01:14:34,460 --> 01:14:36,280
She said Shit about 80 times.

1334
01:14:36,610 --> 01:14:40,690
I just play it back like I'm watching a
flower bloom or watching a fucking eagle

1335
01:14:40,691 --> 01:14:45,190
soar. It's just, he lands this,
he just, the dude's coming at him,

1336
01:14:45,191 --> 01:14:49,870
he steps and she's had the perfect face
plants. I'm like, that shit is just art.

1337
01:14:49,871 --> 01:14:52,720
That's art.
But even when you see like a really,

1338
01:14:52,721 --> 01:14:56,920
really high level fighter move around,
every one of our bodies moves different,

1339
01:14:56,950 --> 01:15:00,520
you know, every, you know, yeah.
You, you, you go back to, you know,

1340
01:15:00,521 --> 01:15:02,170
being able to see somebody in emulate it,

1341
01:15:02,290 --> 01:15:05,010
but you still will put your own
style on it. You still put you on.

1342
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:06,700
Nobody moves the same,
you know?

1343
01:15:06,701 --> 01:15:10,750
And I think that's what
makes it a pure art form.

1344
01:15:10,751 --> 01:15:13,600
And I think MMA is more so even the
boxing because in boxing you only got two

1345
01:15:13,601 --> 01:15:15,820
hands, right? It's a science,
you know, it's the sweet science.

1346
01:15:16,300 --> 01:15:19,840
There's only so many combinations
that you can even put together that.

1347
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:24,460
But when you, when you talk about
something that you know, without limit,

1348
01:15:24,490 --> 01:15:27,550
then there's so much art that goes
into, it's like dance. It's like,

1349
01:15:27,790 --> 01:15:28,630
it's like yoga.

1350
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:32,800
It's like all these things that are really
the truest form of art I think. Yeah.

1351
01:15:32,801 --> 01:15:36,460
I couldn't agree more, you
know? And that's why I was
mad at Mel's Meryl Streep.

1352
01:15:36,810 --> 01:15:37,643
Yeah.
Yeah.

1353
01:15:38,380 --> 01:15:42,520
Know she doesn't know anything
about mixed martial arts,

1354
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:46,510
not VR.
They are the arts 100%.

1355
01:15:47,140 --> 01:15:51,850
And I think the most purest form of it
to, uh, what else did you call arts,

1356
01:15:51,851 --> 01:15:54,760
if not that it's not simply
to understand what it is.

1357
01:15:54,790 --> 01:15:59,590
And one of the things that they don't
understand is that it's so difficult to do

1358
01:15:59,770 --> 01:16:02,410
and that your,
when you see the finished product,

1359
01:16:02,411 --> 01:16:04,720
when the person steps into the
cage and competes that night,

1360
01:16:04,721 --> 01:16:08,620
you're not just seeing these brutish
moves. You're seeing their soul.

1361
01:16:08,650 --> 01:16:10,240
You're seeing how much focus,

1362
01:16:10,390 --> 01:16:13,030
where they are as a human
in their life at this point.

1363
01:16:13,150 --> 01:16:15,070
Where's the vitality of their body?

1364
01:16:15,380 --> 01:16:18,940
What kind of martial arts
education have they gotten?

1365
01:16:18,990 --> 01:16:23,380
How technically aware then how much did
they think about the training? Did they,

1366
01:16:23,381 --> 01:16:25,660
if they're a wrestler, did they
only concentrate on the wrestling?

1367
01:16:25,740 --> 01:16:28,360
Did they stay away from striking cause
they don't like getting hit if they're a

1368
01:16:28,361 --> 01:16:28,990
striker,

1369
01:16:28,990 --> 01:16:31,870
did they only concentrate on staying up
or did they learn how to fight on the

1370
01:16:31,871 --> 01:16:33,250
ground?
Did they absorb it all?

1371
01:16:33,340 --> 01:16:38,020
Did they develop a full repertoire
of expression with their body,

1372
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:40,630
throwing bones and choking each other?
I mean,

1373
01:16:40,810 --> 01:16:44,350
and at the same time going through life
through the whole situation, you know,

1374
01:16:44,810 --> 01:16:46,600
kind of because the hardest part,

1375
01:16:46,620 --> 01:16:48,920
like at the end of the day I was
still a 25 year old dude. Like,

1376
01:16:48,950 --> 01:16:53,570
I'm still like learning and shit and try
to keep it together like everybody else.

1377
01:16:53,571 --> 01:16:54,020
So,

1378
01:16:54,020 --> 01:16:59,020
and I'd be like that when you're 80 men
rally and we look at these 80 year old

1379
01:17:00,581 --> 01:17:02,500
people who say, well that guy
should have his shit together,

1380
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:05,830
that fucking guys better today than he
was yesterday. If I was paying attention,

1381
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:09,470
I think that he had to go back. And I
think that's what it is to at the of it.

1382
01:17:09,530 --> 01:17:12,140
I always think that everybody
else has their shit together.

1383
01:17:12,620 --> 01:17:17,210
I just saw sold everybody all
childhood, 100%. I think one it was,

1384
01:17:17,250 --> 01:17:18,320
I had the same problem.

1385
01:17:18,350 --> 01:17:21,650
I think everybody has their shit
together and everybody can see that.

1386
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:26,180
I don't feel like they can see my flaws.
And it keeps me sharp though.

1387
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:28,790
Like it translates to fight and too,

1388
01:17:28,940 --> 01:17:32,000
it's like if my hand calls
here for a split second,

1389
01:17:32,001 --> 01:17:34,580
I feel like the guy can see it, you know
what I mean? Or why not throw something.

1390
01:17:34,581 --> 01:17:38,400
I'm, I feel like he's gonna be there
to block it or, you know, it makes,

1391
01:17:38,570 --> 01:17:41,260
it makes me stay sharp, but, uh, it's,

1392
01:17:41,780 --> 01:17:44,660
it goes up from sometimes outside
of life too, you know? Well,

1393
01:17:44,661 --> 01:17:48,320
it's good that you think like this because
clearly you're a very confident guy

1394
01:17:48,321 --> 01:17:51,080
and you're obviously successful and
you're mixed martial arts career.

1395
01:17:51,290 --> 01:17:55,610
But to have just a little bit
of that insecurity is fuel.

1396
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:58,860
It's just like, he keeps you sharp.
It keeps you aware, you know,

1397
01:17:58,861 --> 01:18:03,700
like to be confident is good, to
be delusional is terrible. Yeah.

1398
01:18:03,740 --> 01:18:04,820
100% terrible.

1399
01:18:05,420 --> 01:18:08,690
Everybody knows that one guy that thinks
he can beat a guy that he's not ever

1400
01:18:08,691 --> 01:18:11,360
going to fucking be able to be. You know?
I mean, there's a lot of people like,

1401
01:18:11,361 --> 01:18:14,020
give me that fight. I'll, oh yeah,

1402
01:18:16,790 --> 01:18:19,640
wait, no, that's why
you don't see, you know,

1403
01:18:19,641 --> 01:18:23,960
you never see me say some outlandish
shit. Like, oh, I can't never be beat or,

1404
01:18:24,130 --> 01:18:27,500
you know, or I'm, oh, I can go out there
and, you know, our bar, Cain Velasquez,

1405
01:18:27,700 --> 01:18:31,420
you know, or something like that. I
mean, not meaning to pick on Ron, but uh,

1406
01:18:31,450 --> 01:18:34,780
I know he was saying, yeah, but
you know, but I think, you know,

1407
01:18:35,270 --> 01:18:39,800
the Rhonda thing was there was a lot
going on there, man. Coaching wise,

1408
01:18:39,801 --> 01:18:41,290
there's a lot going on there.
What?

1409
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:46,300
She just came along at a time when there
was no one like her when she was a real

1410
01:18:47,010 --> 01:18:51,860
Olympic caliber athlete and her
judo was at such a high level.

1411
01:18:52,010 --> 01:18:53,670
No one could fuck with him and shit,

1412
01:18:53,950 --> 01:18:58,190
throwing people around until someone
could fuck with her until she ran into

1413
01:18:58,191 --> 01:18:59,390
someone like Holly Holm.
And then,

1414
01:18:59,570 --> 01:19:03,650
then we really saw the holes in
the preparation, the distractions,

1415
01:19:03,651 --> 01:19:07,440
the fact that she had, you
know, movie deals going on.

1416
01:19:07,470 --> 01:19:12,290
They wanted her to do road house and
she's scripts and this and agent meetings

1417
01:19:12,291 --> 01:19:14,420
and all the bullshit man.
It's like a fucking Hollywood.

1418
01:19:14,580 --> 01:19:17,080
It was like a Hollywood script.
Like,

1419
01:19:17,140 --> 01:19:19,670
this is what happens to you
and this is how it look rocky.

1420
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:22,970
When rocky went soft and this
is literally what happens.

1421
01:19:23,210 --> 01:19:26,720
And then all of a sudden you've got this
bad ass Holly Holm sitting there ready

1422
01:19:26,721 --> 01:19:30,020
to fucking head kick you into another
dimension. And that's what happened.

1423
01:19:30,021 --> 01:19:30,920
And like you said,
I think,

1424
01:19:30,950 --> 01:19:34,640
I think most of it is just trying to stay
aware and not get the delusional about

1425
01:19:34,641 --> 01:19:38,390
it. Cause it's, it is very easy to kind
of slip into that and fall into that.

1426
01:19:38,391 --> 01:19:42,230
And you know, sometimes she will hit
you. And that's what happened in my,

1427
01:19:42,231 --> 01:19:47,000
in my second fight that I lost,
uh, to Leonardo Santos and,

1428
01:19:47,610 --> 01:19:52,310
and each fight I can always
see myself losing. You know,

1429
01:19:52,790 --> 01:19:54,110
and people ask me that and they're like,

1430
01:19:54,740 --> 01:19:56,660
you talk about all this
visualization that you do.

1431
01:19:56,661 --> 01:19:58,940
Like sometimes I visualize
myself getting hurt too.

1432
01:19:58,941 --> 01:20:02,810
When fights do you do that to see how
you recover? How do you, what do you do?

1433
01:20:02,811 --> 01:20:04,580
So it's not a new experience.

1434
01:20:04,860 --> 01:20:07,770
I Went Barboza fucking spinning
heel kicks me in the head

1435
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:12,150
like his, it's not, uh, it's not, it's
always the punch that don't hurt you.

1436
01:20:12,990 --> 01:20:16,870
It hurts. You were texting before that
fight and we were setting up this podcast.

1437
01:20:16,871 --> 01:20:19,080
You, I just listen, I just got to
concentrate on making sure I do.

1438
01:20:19,081 --> 01:20:21,680
Don't kick me in the head.
And then after the pilot, Dan,

1439
01:20:21,700 --> 01:20:22,860
we fucking kicked me in the head.

1440
01:20:25,750 --> 01:20:30,750
You have definitely, definitely prepare
yourself for the possibility it because,

1441
01:20:30,890 --> 01:20:31,570
because it has to be,

1442
01:20:31,570 --> 01:20:35,800
be there. That's the only fight
that it wasn't there for me was uh,

1443
01:20:35,830 --> 01:20:37,990
Leonardo Santos because he,
he was,

1444
01:20:38,260 --> 01:20:42,280
I mean he multiple times a
champion on the ground and Jujitsu.

1445
01:20:42,640 --> 01:20:46,570
So I was only really worried about his
ground game. I kind of just dismissed his,

1446
01:20:46,900 --> 01:20:49,810
his, uh, his standup and I was like,
no way this guy's going to beat me.

1447
01:20:49,811 --> 01:20:52,420
And the worst thing happened in the fight.

1448
01:20:52,421 --> 01:20:55,270
Like the first minute he
got me down and I got all,

1449
01:20:55,330 --> 01:20:58,660
I got him off me and like 30 seconds or
something. Then after that I was like,

1450
01:20:58,661 --> 01:21:02,020
whew, this about to be a cakewalk.
I'm might just run through this man.

1451
01:21:02,230 --> 01:21:07,090
Like he don't, you know, I'm like,
it was 17,000 people in an arena.

1452
01:21:07,330 --> 01:21:10,900
I'm like, we all just waiting on
him to fall, you know, only him.

1453
01:21:11,080 --> 01:21:13,750
He was the only one that sought it.
He could clip me

1454
01:21:15,710 --> 01:21:19,690
and I'd be dead.
But how valuable was that fight for you?

1455
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:24,760
I mean it was probably one of the
most important ones in my career.

1456
01:21:25,151 --> 01:21:29,560
I mean there there's been a couple of
the losses are have always been the ones

1457
01:21:29,561 --> 01:21:31,660
that I feel like I will look back and say,
damn,

1458
01:21:31,661 --> 01:21:33,220
that was the one that really made it.

1459
01:21:33,221 --> 01:21:35,850
That fight in particular I
think really made it because it,

1460
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:37,570
it kind of drilled home.

1461
01:21:37,571 --> 01:21:40,690
Some of the things that Robert follows
was sounding to me that's the only fight

1462
01:21:40,691 --> 01:21:44,530
since I've been in Vegas.
Well obviously since before this fight,

1463
01:21:44,620 --> 01:21:47,770
but that Robert Follis wasn't
in my corner and it was,

1464
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:51,970
if I'm being honest with save some
money, you know, saved the 10% that he,

1465
01:21:52,060 --> 01:21:54,710
that he wasn't wanted or whatever, and
I was like, I'm going to smoke this kid.

1466
01:21:55,250 --> 01:21:57,130
I'm like, rob, just sit back, you know,

1467
01:21:57,490 --> 01:22:01,750
you watch it from home and joy and I'm
gonna go out there and I'm a smoke this

1468
01:22:01,751 --> 01:22:06,040
kid.
And I didn't have his voice of reason

1469
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:11,650
to make me say, this kid is dangerous
everywhere. You know what I mean?

1470
01:22:11,651 --> 01:22:15,790
Stay sharp everywhere and I let my
guard down any and he hit me with a good

1471
01:22:15,791 --> 01:22:20,770
punch. Uh, but it was
that one where I was like,

1472
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:24,160
I've never had robbed, not in my
corner again or that voice, you know,

1473
01:22:24,161 --> 01:22:28,740
and now I have to make do without it.
But you know, now usually was that boy.

1474
01:22:28,750 --> 01:22:29,740
So yeah,
he was,

1475
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:32,830
but to go back and he was just that
voice of reason not to get delusional.

1476
01:22:32,831 --> 01:22:34,420
You know what I mean?
Cause it's because it is easy,

1477
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:38,260
especially when you're young and you got
the no hormones line or you feel like

1478
01:22:38,261 --> 01:22:41,370
you would a man, like, you know, you
competent like shit, I'm the man.

1479
01:22:41,430 --> 01:22:46,000
Like he can't touch me. But you got
to have somebody like, hey bro, bro,

1480
01:22:46,290 --> 01:22:50,030
you know, you are very good, but
you still gotta be sharp to the,

1481
01:22:50,100 --> 01:22:52,660
these men that you fighting are very,
very good too.

1482
01:22:52,770 --> 01:22:55,360
Do you think that sometimes
someone can't tell it to you?

1483
01:22:55,430 --> 01:22:57,450
You just have to learn it.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

1484
01:22:57,460 --> 01:22:59,280
You got to go through those
experiences and I think doesn't,

1485
01:22:59,410 --> 01:23:02,330
that's an all walks of everything,
you know, and, and, and,

1486
01:23:02,390 --> 01:23:05,590
and that's kind of what I bring to a year.
Like I don't,

1487
01:23:05,660 --> 01:23:08,020
I don't want to just be a,
just a great fighter, you know,

1488
01:23:08,021 --> 01:23:09,850
I want to be graded everything.

1489
01:23:10,060 --> 01:23:12,610
I want to be a chef and I want to
be a dancer and I want to be a,

1490
01:23:12,611 --> 01:23:15,520
science isn't a doctor. And like
that's just the way my brain works.

1491
01:23:15,580 --> 01:23:19,780
I just wanted to be a better fucking
everything the right way to think, man.

1492
01:23:20,010 --> 01:23:24,790
I've done that. It's kind of
inner sometimes, but you know,

1493
01:23:25,660 --> 01:23:28,510
but, uh, you know, there's
a great, I need that

1494
01:23:28,580 --> 01:23:31,430
depression. The way you do anything
is the way you do everything.

1495
01:23:32,120 --> 01:23:35,530
Yeah. Well probably. Yeah.

1496
01:23:35,790 --> 01:23:38,430
Yeah. I mean, I, I think, I
think there's something to that.

1497
01:23:38,431 --> 01:23:41,490
If you have fast things mean you can
get away with being a great fighter and

1498
01:23:41,491 --> 01:23:43,320
still half ass things you live,

1499
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:47,470
but maybe you would be better if you
didn't like maybe you would be even in an

1500
01:23:47,490 --> 01:23:51,320
even better fighter or better whatever
you are, fucking tennis player,

1501
01:23:51,330 --> 01:23:54,960
whatever it is. If you didn't half ass
other things in your life, maybe you,

1502
01:23:55,260 --> 01:23:57,120
you would really reach your full potential

1503
01:23:57,240 --> 01:24:01,120
100%. And I think that even even
in the fighting realm, you know,

1504
01:24:01,121 --> 01:24:03,820
that that's what a lot of
this last fight was for me.

1505
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:08,920
A is getting back to making
the fight first, doing,

1506
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:13,300
focusing on the fight before anything
else and relieving some of the mental

1507
01:24:13,301 --> 01:24:18,070
stress off me before I stepped into
the, when I stepped in for that Co, uh,

1508
01:24:18,190 --> 01:24:21,730
Tony Fight, I was already tired. I
was already, my body was already,

1509
01:24:21,820 --> 01:24:25,780
my brain was just overloaded and I
was already broken down and you know,

1510
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:29,890
I'd made the fight second or I
made the fight last, you know, uh,

1511
01:24:30,220 --> 01:24:33,130
I put everything else before, you
know, it. We went and race car,

1512
01:24:33,131 --> 01:24:36,880
drive it the week of the fight and, and
looking back on it after, I was like,

1513
01:24:36,910 --> 01:24:41,680
oh my God. Yeah. You go to one of
those exotic places during races,

1514
01:24:41,710 --> 01:24:45,770
shout out to them like they, I mean
they look me up. I have fun too.

1515
01:24:45,771 --> 01:24:49,360
I think it's also important to have some
recreation. Yeah. Yeah. But you know,

1516
01:24:49,361 --> 01:24:52,030
that's, that sounds like it was
too much. A little too much.

1517
01:24:52,150 --> 01:24:55,210
And mostly because they were like filming
it and I wanted to make it good and

1518
01:24:55,211 --> 01:24:58,790
then, you know, we have fun with it and Oh
for like the countdown shows. Yeah, yeah,

1519
01:24:58,791 --> 01:25:01,250
yeah. But you know, so you
get that balance. Right.

1520
01:25:01,490 --> 01:25:02,320
How hard is that?

1521
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:06,470
The press obligations and all the
constant interviews and all that shit.

1522
01:25:06,680 --> 01:25:07,970
Joy. I mean, I enjoy them.

1523
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:12,630
I honestly enjoy doing media for
the most part is just, you know,

1524
01:25:12,631 --> 01:25:17,550
on a certain it can be
too much sometimes

1525
01:25:17,930 --> 01:25:21,320
organize it around your training or
did you have to organize your training

1526
01:25:21,350 --> 01:25:24,920
around media obligate? I usually
organize it around my training. Uh,

1527
01:25:25,010 --> 01:25:27,150
and that's good.
It was when,

1528
01:25:27,151 --> 01:25:30,710
when you hear that the training has to
be organized around media obligations and

1529
01:25:30,711 --> 01:25:32,480
like, Oh yeah, that's not true.

1530
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:36,530
I mean maybe I've heard of people having
to get up at six in the morning and do

1531
01:25:36,531 --> 01:25:40,070
a write blocker radio calls and shit.
I'm like, well I don't like that.

1532
01:25:40,490 --> 01:25:41,360
I don't like that shit.

1533
01:25:41,480 --> 01:25:46,410
Yeah. I mean, yeah, you have to do
that, but you know, I still, I kinda,

1534
01:25:46,700 --> 01:25:47,940
I just make do with it,
you know what I mean?

1535
01:25:47,970 --> 01:25:51,440
I think as long as you enjoying it and
you just kind of going with the flow is

1536
01:25:51,441 --> 01:25:54,530
not a hindrance necessarily.
If you, if you like, fuck,

1537
01:25:54,531 --> 01:25:57,760
I don't want to fucking be here. I want
to get up at 6:00 AM and do this shit.

1538
01:25:58,040 --> 01:26:00,960
You know? Then when you get to all that
want to do is train, the whole time,

1539
01:26:00,970 --> 01:26:03,950
you know, is it can be a
hindrance. Even Morrison. Right?

1540
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:08,630
Yeah, I guess, right. Like the way
you approach something will change,

1541
01:26:08,631 --> 01:26:10,300
like what that thing is.

1542
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:13,150
Yeah. And it's gotta be
natural for you to, you know,

1543
01:26:13,180 --> 01:26:17,590
I actually liked liked doing it, so,
uh, I think it's just something that,

1544
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:22,000
you know, if you, if, if I could see
myself, if I forced it or if I, you know,

1545
01:26:22,001 --> 01:26:24,880
was one of these guys that didn't at all,
then yeah,

1546
01:26:24,881 --> 01:26:28,420
I could see it being even a
bigger hindrance, but since
I get at me, it's fine.

1547
01:26:28,610 --> 01:26:30,820
Does great. Well, as long as it
doesn't fuck with your training.

1548
01:26:31,060 --> 01:26:33,970
One of the things I was really impressed
about Saturday night is your endurance.

1549
01:26:34,300 --> 01:26:37,600
I mean, you were, you were fresh
as a daisy even in the fifth round,

1550
01:26:37,601 --> 01:26:39,820
and that was a grueling pace,

1551
01:26:39,910 --> 01:26:44,320
you know? And, uh, we didn't really focus
too much on, on too much conditioning.

1552
01:26:44,321 --> 01:26:46,550
You know, I did a lot of long
runs to, to kind of thin the,

1553
01:26:46,551 --> 01:26:50,830
my muscles out a little bit. Uh, I
did a lot of like longer distance,

1554
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:52,270
longer cardio stuff,

1555
01:26:52,410 --> 01:26:55,360
kind of got away from like a lot of the
explosiveness that I used to do on the,

1556
01:26:55,720 --> 01:26:58,510
especially for the Tony Fight,
Tony fight was all explosion.

1557
01:26:58,720 --> 01:27:02,770
It was all like big movements. It was all
like, you know, I'm out there, I'm a nut,

1558
01:27:02,970 --> 01:27:07,270
this motherfucker out. Uh, but this
fight. And I realized like during it,

1559
01:27:07,271 --> 01:27:11,210
I was like, you know, I got to
approach it smarter and, and,

1560
01:27:11,970 --> 01:27:16,960
and in that it actually became better
cardio then me pushing myself too hard,

1561
01:27:17,350 --> 01:27:18,183
you know what I'm saying?

1562
01:27:19,350 --> 01:27:19,591
You know,

1563
01:27:19,591 --> 01:27:23,370
I'm torn on that because I see guys
preparing that way where they do a lot of

1564
01:27:23,371 --> 01:27:24,670
long runs and you know,

1565
01:27:24,870 --> 01:27:27,990
that's a big Nate Diaz thing and
his brother Nick and you know,

1566
01:27:27,991 --> 01:27:32,991
they do ultra marathons and triathlons
and I feel like there's some real benefit

1567
01:27:33,361 --> 01:27:35,670
to having that deep bass and cardio

1568
01:27:35,810 --> 01:27:39,850
100%. But I mean, it's, it's balanced,
balanced, like anything else would life,

1569
01:27:39,851 --> 01:27:44,750
you know, you gotta, you gotta be able
to, to balance those really strong, tough,

1570
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:47,210
you know, you can't explore every
time. He has spread the whole time.

1571
01:27:47,211 --> 01:27:51,100
But I can't run a marathon the whole time.
So I try my best to,

1572
01:27:51,430 --> 01:27:54,110
that's how I want to be as well
rounded as I possibly can be. And,

1573
01:27:54,160 --> 01:27:58,020
and having great cardio in and
understanding what that's like. Uh,

1574
01:27:58,170 --> 01:28:00,520
as part of that, yes. It's hard for

1575
01:28:00,590 --> 01:28:01,430
people don't understand,

1576
01:28:01,431 --> 01:28:04,640
but you're not throwing a hundred
percent of your power all the time.

1577
01:28:04,990 --> 01:28:09,140
Yeah. You can't, you can't.
No, you can't. Especially not
with a guy like Barboza, uh,

1578
01:28:09,141 --> 01:28:10,880
who is in there the whole time.

1579
01:28:10,881 --> 01:28:15,380
There was some spots that I got him and
it's like, guys, normally we'll, we'll,

1580
01:28:15,381 --> 01:28:17,120
we'll give up. They'll quit or, you know,

1581
01:28:17,121 --> 01:28:21,110
I'm hitting them with big shots and
he's just steady showing the ref day.

1582
01:28:21,170 --> 01:28:24,590
I'm still in this thing. I'm still moving.
And then he stands up and he can spit.

1583
01:28:24,591 --> 01:28:29,330
It will get you in. You know, he's still
got that explosiveness and uh, you know,

1584
01:28:29,331 --> 01:28:32,840
you, you can't go 100% right out the gate.
You, you got to pick him, be kind of,

1585
01:28:32,841 --> 01:28:34,910
be smarter.
You can't wear out how to be smart.

1586
01:28:35,450 --> 01:28:38,330
And that's one of the things that
rob would always tell me. And again,

1587
01:28:38,390 --> 01:28:41,320
that's one of the things I'm
telling myself during the
fights. Be Smart, be smart.

1588
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:42,410
Barboza is also the,

1589
01:28:42,500 --> 01:28:46,220
I think the first guy and the only
guy to stop to people with leg.

1590
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:51,090
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Vicious. Like Kit Kat,
my shit, my shit is on fire right now.

1591
01:28:52,680 --> 01:28:54,000
I checked a couple of them up,

1592
01:28:54,030 --> 01:28:57,660
but did you bring in anybody that does
wheel kicks or anything to get used to

1593
01:28:57,661 --> 01:29:02,640
the timing of that? Yeah. A couple
of guys, a really good taekwondo,

1594
01:29:02,770 --> 01:29:05,240
a specialist, and his name
is, I mean, you wouldn't know.

1595
01:29:05,270 --> 01:29:08,950
Notice a flash out off the black.
I know he,

1596
01:29:08,980 --> 01:29:12,890
he's probably the best at easy, little
bit better than marbles. The marbles is,

1597
01:29:13,950 --> 01:29:14,280
no, no, no.

1598
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:19,050
It just on that not telegraphic portion
of it because that's what really gets

1599
01:29:19,051 --> 01:29:23,610
you hurt, which Barboza is
very non telegraphy. But
those taekwondo guys, they,

1600
01:29:23,850 --> 01:29:27,330
they can move a little bit different. You
know, Chris Bang is a, is another one, uh,

1601
01:29:27,331 --> 01:29:29,870
that, that uh, like
woolly brought out for,

1602
01:29:29,930 --> 01:29:32,340
for wonder boy because he's
got that same style day.

1603
01:29:32,640 --> 01:29:36,060
Th that taekwondo style of spinning is,
it's a little bit different.

1604
01:29:36,061 --> 01:29:38,690
I brought up like three or four guys.
Well it's the guy when they,

1605
01:29:38,730 --> 01:29:41,460
when you train like that,
you're not throwing punches to the face.

1606
01:29:41,490 --> 01:29:45,720
So the kicks have to be ultra fast. It's,
and there's also, I think there's, uh,

1607
01:29:45,930 --> 01:29:46,591
there's this,

1608
01:29:46,591 --> 01:29:51,030
this is some benefit to learning like
Kyoko Shin for that and talk window for

1609
01:29:51,031 --> 01:29:53,610
that. W when they, they take
out those punches to the face.

1610
01:29:53,970 --> 01:29:55,620
There's something about leg dexterity.

1611
01:29:55,621 --> 01:30:00,540
Those guys have crazy leg like Yaya
Rodriguez style, like crazy leg dexterity.

1612
01:30:00,570 --> 01:30:03,370
Yeah, man. Yeah. You've got to spar a
couple of times before this last fight,

1613
01:30:03,780 --> 01:30:06,360
you know, and he, he's another
one of those. I mean he,

1614
01:30:06,570 --> 01:30:10,270
he's got that same type of style and not,
and I steal a lot from those guys. Uh,

1615
01:30:10,340 --> 01:30:15,340
I kind of started picking it up when I
fought a kid named James Mutasa re very

1616
01:30:15,481 --> 01:30:20,330
good. He was married champion champion a
couple of times I think, uh, for, for uh,

1617
01:30:21,030 --> 01:30:23,430
Korea.
But I mean he's just super underrated,

1618
01:30:23,610 --> 01:30:26,610
especially as kicking but
prepared for that fight.

1619
01:30:27,510 --> 01:30:31,110
I had to work with a lot of taekwondo
guys and right off the back I'm like, oh,

1620
01:30:31,111 --> 01:30:34,770
this is a different style. Like
it's, it's like four different,

1621
01:30:34,830 --> 01:30:36,450
four or five different
styles of kicking up.

1622
01:30:36,450 --> 01:30:41,450
Think there's this like wanted a
better mixes of speed and power and not

1623
01:30:42,601 --> 01:30:45,420
telegraphic.
And I try to blend that a little bit more.

1624
01:30:45,421 --> 01:30:48,390
What Moy Tai and find the best style.

1625
01:30:48,840 --> 01:30:50,970
I feel like more is absolutely the best,

1626
01:30:50,971 --> 01:30:54,570
but there's some shit that those taekwondo
guys can do that'll catch you off

1627
01:30:54,571 --> 01:30:58,560
guard. And if you know those other
things, you can do those things. Yeah,

1628
01:30:58,561 --> 01:31:02,920
100% like the wheel kicks. And that's what
what you see with the eds. I mean the,

1629
01:31:02,921 --> 01:31:07,650
the Thai style has probably the hardest
kicks and the, the most technical,

1630
01:31:07,890 --> 01:31:11,790
uh, from it. But you know, you can kind
of see some of them come in, you know,

1631
01:31:11,791 --> 01:31:16,530
you could see unless you got free
speed light like Barboza you know,

1632
01:31:16,620 --> 01:31:19,110
but actual technical wise,
you know,

1633
01:31:19,111 --> 01:31:23,520
you can kind of see it coming a little
bit more time is more effective because

1634
01:31:23,521 --> 01:31:26,940
it's just more effective. This chopping
the legs, it just brutally effective.

1635
01:31:27,330 --> 01:31:30,710
And obviously in taekwondo there's none
of that. Yeah. So those guys wouldn't,

1636
01:31:30,720 --> 01:31:34,260
if you were seeing like matches we're
talking with no guys fight Moy Thai guys,

1637
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:37,140
they get a blood red.
Yeah, yeah. No for sure.

1638
01:31:37,170 --> 01:31:39,810
If you allow the Moy Thai
guy to kick the legs,

1639
01:31:39,890 --> 01:31:43,230
taekwondo guys just really don't
know what to do. Once they learn it,

1640
01:31:43,530 --> 01:31:46,620
then they have the taekwondo too.
But it's a matter of whether or not,

1641
01:31:46,621 --> 01:31:48,930
like we were talking about before,
like if you're a wrestler,

1642
01:31:48,931 --> 01:31:52,030
do you really learn how to try? Could you
just try take everybody? But you know,

1643
01:31:52,031 --> 01:31:56,070
it's, if the taekwondo guys really
learn how to check leg kicks,

1644
01:31:56,220 --> 01:31:58,020
they already know how
to kick. Yeah. They'll,

1645
01:31:58,021 --> 01:32:00,220
they'll be able to pick up the style way

1646
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:03,820
quicker than the Thai guys are going to
be able to do jumping wheel kicks and

1647
01:32:03,821 --> 01:32:06,730
shit like that. That stuff is already
ingrained in their wheelhouse.

1648
01:32:06,731 --> 01:32:08,920
It's in their synapses.
They know what to do.

1649
01:32:09,260 --> 01:32:10,150
Yeah.
And that's that.

1650
01:32:10,151 --> 01:32:14,150
I think that's one of the things that
the beauties about MMA being such a young

1651
01:32:14,151 --> 01:32:18,620
sport is, you know, you still seeing guys
evolving and, and you know, like, like me,

1652
01:32:18,621 --> 01:32:22,340
I'm trying to take that, the best of
those styles and make them great for MMA.

1653
01:32:22,520 --> 01:32:24,820
You know, because there are certain, you
know, you can't chop down the leg if,

1654
01:32:24,830 --> 01:32:26,370
if a guy's trying to take you down,
you know,

1655
01:32:26,380 --> 01:32:28,100
but you could steal a chopped the leg.

1656
01:32:28,101 --> 01:32:31,130
But there's certain ways that
you can change that up. And, uh,

1657
01:32:31,220 --> 01:32:35,450
that's one of the beauties about the sport
being so youngest. Still figuring out,

1658
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:39,440
people ask me, I sat right next to a Oh
area, what shall I sat right next to,

1659
01:32:39,490 --> 01:32:43,340
to Demetrius Johnson and they asked me
who's the best pound for pound fighter.

1660
01:32:43,910 --> 01:32:45,080
And you know,

1661
01:32:45,081 --> 01:32:48,680
I think people like expected me to
say me or something or to say Dj.

1662
01:32:48,680 --> 01:32:53,300
And I honestly don't think that
he's been testing yet. You know,

1663
01:32:53,540 --> 01:32:57,140
I think he's still like a 16 year old
kid out there somewhere that's going to

1664
01:32:57,141 --> 01:32:59,440
find the best guy out. That really, yeah.

1665
01:32:59,990 --> 01:33:02,500
You don't think Demetrius is the best
guy? No, I didn't meet you as hell.

1666
01:33:02,540 --> 01:33:06,230
I mean Demetrius does a, I mean
he's great, he does a lot of things,

1667
01:33:06,231 --> 01:33:10,340
but he gets away with a lot of stuff
that he does because the guys that he's

1668
01:33:10,341 --> 01:33:12,200
going against our 25 pounders,
you know,

1669
01:33:12,210 --> 01:33:16,610
they don't have a whole lot of explosive
one punch power to really make you pay

1670
01:33:16,611 --> 01:33:18,650
for something to mistakes.
You know, the like as far as,

1671
01:33:18,651 --> 01:33:21,500
especially as far as like the hop
switching and stuff, you know,

1672
01:33:21,501 --> 01:33:22,334
that's why I got like,

1673
01:33:22,340 --> 01:33:27,340
like Tj can get away with it a lot more
at 35 I think then a 55 pound fighter

1674
01:33:28,131 --> 01:33:32,270
would, you know, Tj crews, a lot of those
35 years that can kind of, that style

1675
01:33:32,330 --> 01:33:36,350
leave opening the consequences could be
so much more devastating because they

1676
01:33:36,351 --> 01:33:37,040
hit so much harder.

1677
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:40,370
Yeah. I mean your legs are your,
your shock absorbers. You know, when,

1678
01:33:40,380 --> 01:33:42,920
when I get the wall,
the leg or the shotguns doors,

1679
01:33:42,921 --> 01:33:47,270
if your legs are in the air while you
get hit by somebody that's explosive like

1680
01:33:47,271 --> 01:33:50,180
that you going night night, you
know, the only thing that's eaten,

1681
01:33:50,181 --> 01:33:51,590
all the shock of your brain,

1682
01:33:52,970 --> 01:33:55,760
Duane Ludwig would disagree with you
if you sat down and talked to him.

1683
01:33:55,761 --> 01:34:00,761
Cause I think the idea is to present a
very complex target and to overload the

1684
01:34:01,341 --> 01:34:02,174
brain with positive

1685
01:34:02,190 --> 01:34:06,750
buildings. I feel that, you know, and,
and, and, and I try and do that too.

1686
01:34:06,751 --> 01:34:09,140
I try and uh, you know,
I've taken Dwayne's a,

1687
01:34:09,160 --> 01:34:12,060
a couple of the ways seminars actually,
and he's a wizard. Yeah. Yeah.

1688
01:34:12,061 --> 01:34:15,430
He comes over to extreme, but 200 does
some things. So, you know, I liked,

1689
01:34:15,431 --> 01:34:18,320
I like his style. Shout out to
Duane Ludwig. Yeah, no, I, I,

1690
01:34:18,440 --> 01:34:20,820
I love the way you style and it's
just a different style to be had,

1691
01:34:20,821 --> 01:34:23,600
but I feel like that's not even, it's
still not the best out. You know,

1692
01:34:23,610 --> 01:34:26,940
I don't think the best style has been,
Demetrius Johnson has a great style,

1693
01:34:26,970 --> 01:34:29,370
but I don't think it's the
best style has been seen yet.

1694
01:34:29,720 --> 01:34:34,110
Hmm. Especially for him, it, but out of
what you've seen, he's got the best style.

1695
01:34:34,380 --> 01:34:37,500
Yeah. I mean, everybody's
different. Everybody's different,

1696
01:34:37,501 --> 01:34:40,770
you know what I'm saying is the argument
is him and Jon Jones, the two arguments,

1697
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:45,780
and I feel like John Jones, as far
as the level of talent, no question.

1698
01:34:45,930 --> 01:34:50,930
John's faced for show
gone d c twice Gustafson.

1699
01:34:51,900 --> 01:34:55,760
I mean, yeah, Vito Belfort.
I mean, Jesus Christ do,

1700
01:34:55,761 --> 01:34:57,620
you could just keep going and going and,
and gone

1701
01:34:58,010 --> 01:35:01,730
Glover to sharer. You know, he's got, he's
got the resume, but I don't know, I think,

1702
01:35:01,970 --> 01:35:06,800
I think George Saint Pierre, uh, right
steel, you know, Georgia is a little bit,

1703
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:10,640
uh, you know, behind the
times now a little bit.

1704
01:35:10,730 --> 01:35:14,180
Do you think so a little bit, man. I
don't know. After that that's been fired.

1705
01:35:14,181 --> 01:35:16,790
I would never say that. Yeah.
Yeah. But, but you know,

1706
01:35:16,791 --> 01:35:19,510
Bisping is also from the
same era. I think. Um,

1707
01:35:20,630 --> 01:35:23,480
I think Georgia, if Jason,
George Saint Pierre for sure,

1708
01:35:23,481 --> 01:35:26,330
I think is the greatest fighter
that there's been. I don't, I mean,

1709
01:35:26,390 --> 01:35:30,260
when you look at the resumes, I don't
think nobody else compares really. Uh,

1710
01:35:30,261 --> 01:35:33,820
you know, he's got two losses to binge
both those losses and devastatingly,

1711
01:35:34,030 --> 01:35:34,281
you know,

1712
01:35:34,281 --> 01:35:38,210
came back after four years and won the
title at a higher weight class and he's

1713
01:35:38,211 --> 01:35:42,410
never really been in too much
trouble in a fight. Uh, you know,

1714
01:35:42,411 --> 01:35:45,950
I look at his style. He's one of those
guys, he's one of the very first guys.

1715
01:35:46,310 --> 01:35:51,310
He's really what got me into the sport
because I saw his fight with Bj and I

1716
01:35:52,821 --> 01:35:56,630
just, I can see it. I'm like, Oh,
this guy is, you know, he's smart.

1717
01:35:56,690 --> 01:36:01,370
He's approaching it smart like a,
like a true athlete,

1718
01:36:01,430 --> 01:36:04,880
you know, like a true artist,
like true athlete. And uh, there,

1719
01:36:04,900 --> 01:36:07,250
there are people that do it too.
You know, Demetrius does too.

1720
01:36:07,251 --> 01:36:10,790
But I just don't think to the level
that George has done well, again,

1721
01:36:10,791 --> 01:36:12,590
it's the level of
competition that he faced.

1722
01:36:12,591 --> 01:36:15,880
I mean judge George face some
seriously stiff competition.

1723
01:36:15,890 --> 01:36:18,740
Not that Demetrius didn't,
I mean he fought Dominick Cruz.

1724
01:36:18,741 --> 01:36:23,480
He's fought some tough cause I was really
looking forward to Demetrius versus Tj

1725
01:36:23,720 --> 01:36:26,000
and I know they were trying
to put that together,

1726
01:36:26,001 --> 01:36:29,960
but that would have been the one love
that fight. And it still might be the one,

1727
01:36:29,961 --> 01:36:31,550
they might still do it.
I mean,

1728
01:36:31,551 --> 01:36:36,551
if a Tj can defeat Cody or even if he
doesn't and if he decides to go down to

1729
01:36:36,951 --> 01:36:41,350
25, he can make it. He says,
yeah, he says he can make it.
Yeah, I think you can in a,

1730
01:36:41,390 --> 01:36:43,790
I think he can give them
some real problems. Oh,

1731
01:36:43,791 --> 01:36:48,470
it'll be the biggest fight of his life.
100% sure he's fast. He hits hard,

1732
01:36:48,471 --> 01:36:50,270
he knocks guys out at 35,

1733
01:36:50,390 --> 01:36:53,120
what the fuck is he going to
do to people at 25 if he can,

1734
01:36:53,310 --> 01:36:56,480
if his body will stay healthy
with that weight cut, you know,

1735
01:36:56,481 --> 01:36:59,480
and you know as good as anybody that
that's very difficult to do because you

1736
01:36:59,481 --> 01:37:03,560
just feel weaker. Yeah. Yeah.
I mean there's that, uh,
I, I know the guys that he,

1737
01:37:03,620 --> 01:37:08,570
that he trains down in South California
with um, uh, the training lab.

1738
01:37:09,740 --> 01:37:12,650
That man approaches it like
a scientist for real. He,

1739
01:37:12,651 --> 01:37:17,570
I think he's a mathematician over at
UC Berkeley. I want to change this guy.

1740
01:37:17,571 --> 01:37:21,050
I sat down with them for about, we
talked for maybe about five, six hours.

1741
01:37:21,051 --> 01:37:22,130
It was mostly him just talking.

1742
01:37:22,190 --> 01:37:26,540
It may just sitting there absorbing all
the shit that he could tell me about,

1743
01:37:26,780 --> 01:37:31,220
you know, exactly. He, I mean,
he measures those guys to,

1744
01:37:31,280 --> 01:37:36,170
to a t. Uh, so if he feels like he
can, who's training with him? Uh,

1745
01:37:36,330 --> 01:37:40,150
Dillashaw and is he a strength
and conditioning guys? Sam, uh,

1746
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:45,050
cal cal veto. If I'm saying that Right Sam
Cup or you know, down to train and lap.

1747
01:37:45,200 --> 01:37:49,060
Okay. Brilliant. Brilliant man. He,
he's, he's one of the very few guys that,

1748
01:37:49,061 --> 01:37:53,950
that I think in MMA especially that
really, he, he trained a lot of uh,

1749
01:37:53,990 --> 01:37:56,070
he trains David Taylor, a lot of the, the

1750
01:37:56,070 --> 01:38:00,770
u s uh, Olympic wrestling team. He
worked with those guys for a long time.

1751
01:38:00,900 --> 01:38:03,240
What are you seeing?
Some mad scientists get into the game now,

1752
01:38:03,241 --> 01:38:06,390
right when they realize that there's
real money in it and it's just mad.

1753
01:38:06,391 --> 01:38:10,020
Is what 55 56 does a those iron mans,

1754
01:38:10,340 --> 01:38:11,910
you know where you got to like,

1755
01:38:11,970 --> 01:38:16,970
I think it's like something crazy like
bike 120 miles and then you swim 20 miles

1756
01:38:17,461 --> 01:38:22,080
and then you run a full marathon and
he's doing it like 53 54 years old.

1757
01:38:22,081 --> 01:38:25,490
I'm like, God, I went over and
train with them before and it is,

1758
01:38:25,630 --> 01:38:28,770
is something is another level of
like strength and conditioning.

1759
01:38:28,780 --> 01:38:32,310
So if he says he can get TJ down to 25,
I mean I would,

1760
01:38:32,910 --> 01:38:35,790
I would think he could do it.
And if he's confident in it,

1761
01:38:35,820 --> 01:38:37,950
then he can do it in the right
way. At least. I spoke to Tj,

1762
01:38:37,951 --> 01:38:40,620
he was a hundred percent confident
that it could make the way and he just,

1763
01:38:40,621 --> 01:38:44,970
well you got also realize Dj
Dimitris just got shoulder surgery,

1764
01:38:45,390 --> 01:38:47,760
so he's still rehabbing from that,
you know,

1765
01:38:47,761 --> 01:38:49,050
and who knows how long
that's going to take.

1766
01:38:49,051 --> 01:38:53,530
I don't know how complex this shoulder
surgery was, but yeah, that's, you know,

1767
01:38:53,590 --> 01:38:56,700
still interested in that fight. I
mean that's, it's a big one for, uh,

1768
01:38:56,730 --> 01:39:00,990
for Demetrius Johnson
especially, you know, he needs
that extra little push over.

1769
01:39:00,991 --> 01:39:02,310
You know how Shannon gave him some tips,

1770
01:39:02,311 --> 01:39:06,990
some tricks when we were
still in the media tours
together for the talk shit. No,

1771
01:39:06,991 --> 01:39:09,720
not necessarily to talk shit,
but, you know, cause he, he,

1772
01:39:09,721 --> 01:39:12,710
he's not going to be able to come
out and just talk shit. You know,

1773
01:39:12,870 --> 01:39:17,370
he's kind of style. It's not his
style. It don't work, you know. Uh,

1774
01:39:17,790 --> 01:39:22,550
but to round out his game a little bit.
Boy, let's say that I know he says,

1775
01:39:22,890 --> 01:39:26,760
because I'm going to go back to
the most well rounded fighter.

1776
01:39:26,761 --> 01:39:29,430
You got to be able to promote to, you
know, you've got to be able to see,

1777
01:39:29,431 --> 01:39:34,260
people want to want to see you fight
to, uh, and that thing is a stress.

1778
01:39:34,530 --> 01:39:38,910
It's a, it's a stressor on you and you're
on your, you're training, like you said,

1779
01:39:38,911 --> 01:39:41,340
you've got to get up at 6:00
AM because when you do it,

1780
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:43,320
you get more media requests.
So you get,

1781
01:39:43,350 --> 01:39:46,590
you get to have those interviews more
and that's a stress and it's something

1782
01:39:46,591 --> 01:39:49,830
that you, Barron at your opponent
don't necessarily have to, you know, a,

1783
01:39:49,831 --> 01:39:53,790
a guy like Conor does a lot more media
than, than his opponent though of course,

1784
01:39:53,810 --> 01:39:56,250
it's,
it's a bigger stress and you know,

1785
01:39:56,340 --> 01:40:00,140
if you can handle all those stresses
and still go out there and compete, uh,

1786
01:40:00,630 --> 01:40:02,700
then if you shy away from that,

1787
01:40:02,730 --> 01:40:06,600
I got to take that away from you as far
as being the best power file pod fighter.

1788
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:09,480
You know what I mean? That's
interesting. But if it's not Demetrius,

1789
01:40:09,481 --> 01:40:12,570
and who the fuck is it other than
George and George isn't really fighting

1790
01:40:13,140 --> 01:40:15,400
[inaudible] for short.
John Jones, you know,

1791
01:40:15,490 --> 01:40:19,290
I think George really fighting right
now either. Oh you saying right,

1792
01:40:19,291 --> 01:40:22,480
right now in this sport it was hard
because John, I mean it's up there.

1793
01:40:22,481 --> 01:40:25,890
I mean I don't think John took PDDs and
people give me a hard time about that.

1794
01:40:25,950 --> 01:40:26,760
I don't think he did.

1795
01:40:26,760 --> 01:40:30,630
I think he took something tainted just
based on what you saw to has said about

1796
01:40:30,631 --> 01:40:35,220
the levels pre and post test.
I think you fucked up and tell us.

1797
01:40:35,221 --> 01:40:40,110
I'm that muddy up mass man.
I was roof too fucked up money.

1798
01:40:40,111 --> 01:40:43,650
But he could still, they could still come
back and be much bigger. Uh, you know,

1799
01:40:43,651 --> 01:40:45,390
like I said, controversy,
especially when you know,

1800
01:40:45,410 --> 01:40:48,130
especially when you're black in
America, controversy is, is, is,

1801
01:40:48,170 --> 01:40:51,000
is one of the best things they can
have until you really, well John,

1802
01:40:51,090 --> 01:40:54,120
when he's loose and when you know,
like when

1803
01:40:54,250 --> 01:40:57,580
him and Daniel were in that
press conference and Danny
was talking shit, he goes,

1804
01:40:57,581 --> 01:40:59,590
I beat you after I did cocaine.
Yeah.

1805
01:40:59,790 --> 01:41:03,390
What jaws. Just himself. I mean,
he's huge. He's, he's, he's,

1806
01:41:03,391 --> 01:41:06,680
he's going to be the biggest, uh, he
could have already been the biggest star.

1807
01:41:06,681 --> 01:41:08,280
V You're just on the beginning.

1808
01:41:08,310 --> 01:41:12,510
If they don't really suspend him for
very long when he comes back within a few

1809
01:41:12,510 --> 01:41:15,900
months, it's entirely possible
that he could come back, you know,

1810
01:41:15,901 --> 01:41:20,070
and be the biggest still of all time. I
think he's going to be way bigger. Uh,

1811
01:41:20,100 --> 01:41:22,320
especially after, like I said,
controversies is a great one.

1812
01:41:22,321 --> 01:41:27,000
Where you black in America, they really,
dad, it's like for John, like how much,

1813
01:41:27,330 --> 01:41:29,510
how much more focus will there,

1814
01:41:29,640 --> 01:41:34,640
I mean my fear is that he's going to s
somehow another sabotage again and that,

1815
01:41:36,050 --> 01:41:38,130
that this is not just this,

1816
01:41:38,430 --> 01:41:42,480
that these lessons aren't sinking in
because there's been so many of them.

1817
01:41:42,481 --> 01:41:46,500
The car accident where the broke the
lady's arm and she's pregnant and he runs

1818
01:41:46,501 --> 01:41:51,420
away and then slamming the car
into the tree. There was so many.

1819
01:41:51,450 --> 01:41:55,590
And then there's, you know, the first
test positive and then the second test,

1820
01:41:55,591 --> 01:42:00,060
positive like, fuck the brawl, the
press conference. Fuck. It's like,

1821
01:42:00,061 --> 01:42:01,350
there's so many things

1822
01:42:01,470 --> 01:42:03,390
I think that goes back to,
you know,

1823
01:42:03,480 --> 01:42:07,050
not being delusional and having the right
team around you and somebody that you

1824
01:42:07,051 --> 01:42:10,700
really listened to, that's that you
really truly listened to, you know,

1825
01:42:10,710 --> 01:42:14,970
not just somebody that you just kind
of hard. Right. Yeah, I hear you. Uh,

1826
01:42:15,300 --> 01:42:19,830
because it's easy to get that way.
It really is. I'm sure like in,

1827
01:42:19,831 --> 01:42:21,960
I've approached it a couple of
times, you know, you get that,

1828
01:42:22,230 --> 01:42:25,770
especially when you got that confidence
in the thing that made you great in the

1829
01:42:25,771 --> 01:42:30,390
first place. It can be like a
hindrance to you too. And I think

1830
01:42:32,130 --> 01:42:33,060
a lot of it has been,

1831
01:42:33,330 --> 01:42:36,180
or at least a lot of my growth in the
past couple of months has been me getting

1832
01:42:36,181 --> 01:42:40,950
in my own head and understanding it
and, and kind of breaking it down. Uh,

1833
01:42:41,250 --> 01:42:42,430
you know,
smoke weed helps

1834
01:42:44,810 --> 01:42:49,090
a lot to you that God is legal now.
Yeah.

1835
01:42:49,170 --> 01:42:53,700
I didn't start until after my last,
uh, to Leonardo. Really? Yeah.

1836
01:42:54,270 --> 01:42:58,280
First Time that idea. But honestly it
was probably like the best thing that,

1837
01:42:59,610 --> 01:43:02,430
because I was angry at the fight. I
was angry at everything, you know, the,

1838
01:43:02,460 --> 01:43:04,620
I was like, fuck, how can
I, you know, this guy,

1839
01:43:04,650 --> 01:43:06,630
I was like a 10 to one
favorite going into that fight.

1840
01:43:06,631 --> 01:43:10,620
That was the one fight without never saw
him. I was like, don't you smoke them? Uh,

1841
01:43:10,621 --> 01:43:15,621
so I just had this anger and the only way
I saw my dad can I deal with it was it

1842
01:43:15,750 --> 01:43:20,340
was alcohol. So I kind of turned to
that and you know that it's no good.

1843
01:43:20,690 --> 01:43:23,310
It's really, it's the worst way
to do it. Worst way to do it.

1844
01:43:23,340 --> 01:43:26,010
It just makes the delusions bigger.
You know what I'm saying?

1845
01:43:26,040 --> 01:43:30,270
It just makes you angry or
in, and it just, it just kind
of compounded everything.

1846
01:43:30,720 --> 01:43:33,960
But honestly, like what I smoke weed was
like, cause at that point hasn't like,

1847
01:43:33,970 --> 01:43:34,803
you know what,

1848
01:43:35,610 --> 01:43:40,610
I had tuned it out for so long because
that's what folks did that I kind of

1849
01:43:41,071 --> 01:43:43,980
associated with being lazy and the hospice
as well. And you know, these fucking,

1850
01:43:44,220 --> 01:43:49,080
you know, you know, I don't want
to be on a corner, right? Like, uh,

1851
01:43:49,380 --> 01:43:54,290
but when I did it, it kind of
opened up the anger towards myself.

1852
01:43:54,291 --> 01:43:57,720
You know what I mean? It kind of opened
up my mom for the first time and, and,

1853
01:43:57,721 --> 01:44:01,400
and I think that actually did help a
lot of help with any, you know, I don't,

1854
01:44:01,401 --> 01:44:04,520
I don't like karate or nothing, but you
know, I know what you're saying. Yeah.

1855
01:44:04,700 --> 01:44:05,990
I think that's what people were afraid

1856
01:44:06,070 --> 01:44:08,160
of with it too,
is that paranoia.

1857
01:44:08,490 --> 01:44:13,060
I would say paranoia is just you looking
at things realistically and even the

1858
01:44:13,080 --> 01:44:17,070
possibilities of things
happening realistically. I
mean, some people for sure,

1859
01:44:17,071 --> 01:44:20,700
if they have tendencies to be
schizophrenia in particular
and then they smoke a

1860
01:44:20,701 --> 01:44:22,020
lot of weed,
it could spiral them.

1861
01:44:22,120 --> 01:44:26,580
Cool. Yeah, it does sound like anything
else I spoke, it's not a good idea that,

1862
01:44:26,600 --> 01:44:30,720
you know, isn't doing too much of any
one thing is not a good idea. I mean,

1863
01:44:30,870 --> 01:44:35,290
he's the same way. You have to,
you have to be able to, to balance,

1864
01:44:35,350 --> 01:44:37,570
you know what I mean? You can't just
fucking sit on the couch all day,

1865
01:44:37,840 --> 01:44:38,450
but I'm glad.
Yeah.

1866
01:44:38,450 --> 01:44:41,140
You're saying that there's a real
benefit to it too. There's some,

1867
01:44:41,210 --> 01:44:45,500
there's a benefit to it
mentally and exposing that
vulnerability and just making

1868
01:44:45,501 --> 01:44:49,520
you aware of who you really are.
Like maybe to other people.

1869
01:44:49,860 --> 01:44:51,500
We all,
especially men,

1870
01:44:51,770 --> 01:44:56,770
I think we puff our chests up and we like
to look at ourselves as a baby better

1871
01:44:56,931 --> 01:44:58,790
than we really are because it's,
it's,

1872
01:44:58,820 --> 01:45:03,410
it's like a shield that like a false
confidence shield that you put up to

1873
01:45:03,411 --> 01:45:06,680
protect yourself from your vulnerability.
But marijuana says not enough.

1874
01:45:06,720 --> 01:45:07,550
Fuck that.

1875
01:45:07,550 --> 01:45:10,190
Why don't you just look at whatever
the fuck your vulnerability and stopped

1876
01:45:10,191 --> 01:45:12,740
doing that stupid like this is,
this is your problem,

1877
01:45:12,741 --> 01:45:15,230
this is what you're scared of
me. Like Shit. The weeds, right?

1878
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:18,500
Yeah. It can help you. Yeah.
And it, and it Kinda Alexa App,

1879
01:45:18,550 --> 01:45:21,730
especially after that fight, I
remember it. That really made me,

1880
01:45:21,820 --> 01:45:24,940
that really helped me to get
over and not just get over it,

1881
01:45:25,150 --> 01:45:29,560
but to understand it and understand
what I was doing. Uh, because again,

1882
01:45:29,561 --> 01:45:33,150
you just don't, you know, you get that
the informal is maybe it's testosterone.

1883
01:45:33,160 --> 01:45:35,650
You get that fucking, yeah.
Puppy. He's just all, you know,

1884
01:45:35,651 --> 01:45:37,630
you don't give a fuck
you part of it for sure.

1885
01:45:38,160 --> 01:45:41,120
It's just, it's also think about what
you're doing for a living man, ma'am.

1886
01:45:41,121 --> 01:45:41,730
It's the most,

1887
01:45:41,730 --> 01:45:46,170
one of the most risky propositions you
could do as a human being outside of war.

1888
01:45:46,210 --> 01:45:49,640
That, that too. That too. And I
took that into, you know, you,

1889
01:45:49,820 --> 01:45:51,770
you obviously you take that
into consideration when you,

1890
01:45:51,800 --> 01:45:53,420
when you start doing something like this,

1891
01:45:54,570 --> 01:45:59,300
I'd taken into consideration every fight.
Um, you know, once slight one slip up,

1892
01:45:59,360 --> 01:46:04,280
you could be bad news. Sure. Injury
can take you out forever, you know,

1893
01:46:04,281 --> 01:46:05,840
especially when the EU was,

1894
01:46:05,841 --> 01:46:09,500
and when I was in my situation and
even when I was signed with the UFC,

1895
01:46:10,430 --> 01:46:15,010
it was like, okay, do I go and try and be
a doctor and you know, or you know, I was,

1896
01:46:15,020 --> 01:46:18,350
I was going into bio mat so I was like,
I was really,

1897
01:46:19,070 --> 01:46:21,530
that seemed more secure.
You know what I mean?

1898
01:46:21,531 --> 01:46:26,531
That seems more like
attainable easier or do I like,

1899
01:46:27,340 --> 01:46:29,540
I can't like throw caution to the wind.
And you know,

1900
01:46:29,541 --> 01:46:34,120
at the time when I was 18 or
19, uh, no, I guess I'm a yeah,

1901
01:46:34,340 --> 01:46:38,980
19. Uh, you know, that was like
a hard, you know what I'm saying?

1902
01:46:38,981 --> 01:46:41,180
I'm one of those ones that
was hard for me to make,

1903
01:46:41,181 --> 01:46:44,370
but it turned out well I guess at least.
Well it's,

1904
01:46:45,250 --> 01:46:48,520
you're going to have more
than one interest too. That's
also part of the problem.

1905
01:46:48,521 --> 01:46:49,354
There's probably,

1906
01:46:49,800 --> 01:46:52,430
there's a lot of people out there that
like doing different things and you,

1907
01:46:52,500 --> 01:46:52,861
you know,

1908
01:46:52,861 --> 01:46:56,760
you might be leaning more towards one
than the other and you just got to kind of

1909
01:46:56,970 --> 01:46:59,910
soul search and nobody could
answer that other than you.

1910
01:46:59,940 --> 01:47:03,330
That's why it's terrible when
people tell people what to do.

1911
01:47:03,630 --> 01:47:08,100
When people tell people what you need to
do is get a good job or you need to go

1912
01:47:08,101 --> 01:47:11,880
with something that's going to be saved,
go with what's attainable. Go with that.

1913
01:47:12,120 --> 01:47:14,820
And I'm like, man, that's not
right. Well, everybody's different.

1914
01:47:14,900 --> 01:47:19,370
100% and I think that's the,
I mean to go back just to rob desk,

1915
01:47:19,430 --> 01:47:23,060
that's what he did so well he didn't,
he didn't tell me what to do.

1916
01:47:23,090 --> 01:47:26,540
He just showed me the truth kind
of, you know what I mean? He just,

1917
01:47:26,630 --> 01:47:29,730
he was that voice. Am I, it was
like the conscious and I mean,

1918
01:47:29,740 --> 01:47:33,350
and it hit your show. It too, like you do
a good job, you do a great job of it. Uh,

1919
01:47:33,351 --> 01:47:35,450
and I mean I know you've heard it before,

1920
01:47:35,451 --> 01:47:40,451
like you just are very truthful in
what you say and instead of being like

1921
01:47:42,230 --> 01:47:44,510
preachy because nobody listened to
fucking preachy. You know what I mean?

1922
01:47:44,610 --> 01:47:48,010
She's usually,
well I try not to be,

1923
01:47:48,040 --> 01:47:51,250
but sometimes it comes off maybe
sounding preachy if you don't know me,

1924
01:47:51,251 --> 01:47:54,640
but it's just honest and that,
you know,

1925
01:47:55,150 --> 01:47:57,550
there's what you said about Robert,

1926
01:47:57,700 --> 01:48:00,520
one of the most important things
about it is that he shows you,

1927
01:48:00,940 --> 01:48:03,910
he's just showing you and you
could trust him. You know, those,

1928
01:48:03,911 --> 01:48:07,030
those two things are very important.
Someone who would just show you things,

1929
01:48:07,240 --> 01:48:10,990
show you what's wrong, showing and that
you can trust. He's not bullshitting you.

1930
01:48:11,170 --> 01:48:14,290
When as soon as you think that someone
is bullshitting you are bullshitting

1931
01:48:14,291 --> 01:48:17,290
themselves or being Dell,
you're like, fuck man,

1932
01:48:17,291 --> 01:48:19,990
I can't cause they might have good
information about other things.

1933
01:48:19,991 --> 01:48:22,330
That's a real problem
when someone's an idiot,

1934
01:48:22,450 --> 01:48:25,220
but also a genius like that that exists.

1935
01:48:25,221 --> 01:48:27,260
There's people out there
and those people you can,

1936
01:48:27,330 --> 01:48:29,280
that's how fucking puzzle you got to go.
Okay,

1937
01:48:29,290 --> 01:48:31,600
how much of this do what
he's saying is stupid?

1938
01:48:31,920 --> 01:48:35,680
How much of what he's saying is genius
and sometimes it's a weird mixture.

1939
01:48:35,830 --> 01:48:38,400
Yeah. This is, I think that's one
of the things that I'm learning,

1940
01:48:38,610 --> 01:48:42,240
especially as I'm kind of going forward
and cause you may get to meet so many

1941
01:48:42,241 --> 01:48:44,940
people and uh,
so many people want to be a friend.

1942
01:48:45,090 --> 01:48:47,670
All of a sudden there's so many people,
everybody's got,

1943
01:48:47,671 --> 01:48:49,890
they want to tell you how to do your job.

1944
01:48:49,950 --> 01:48:52,620
Like everybody want to tell me how to
fight and everybody wanted to tell me like

1945
01:48:52,621 --> 01:48:55,050
what to do and how to
do this awesome thing.

1946
01:48:55,170 --> 01:48:57,360
But some people really know what
they're talking about actually though.

1947
01:48:57,361 --> 01:49:00,230
So you have to be able to,
you know,

1948
01:49:00,240 --> 01:49:03,470
I think you got to find that
yellow bullshit meter in there and,

1949
01:49:03,590 --> 01:49:08,020
and kind of pick it apart. It for me,
rob was dead and you know, he, but the,

1950
01:49:08,060 --> 01:49:10,560
the shit that he's still says this is,
you know,

1951
01:49:11,180 --> 01:49:13,970
I mean, you still get information on
how to fight from your yoga instructor.

1952
01:49:13,971 --> 01:49:18,080
She could say something to you and that
one thing will just sit in your head. Oh

1953
01:49:18,470 --> 01:49:22,880
yeah. I had a, uh, a girl named, you
call it a little Japanese girl, uh,

1954
01:49:23,150 --> 01:49:25,250
that was giving me privates and,
and Yoga.

1955
01:49:25,550 --> 01:49:28,880
But the way she broke it
down was like anatomy almost.

1956
01:49:29,540 --> 01:49:31,790
She knew the exact,
you know,

1957
01:49:31,820 --> 01:49:35,990
position that I was here instead of being
here where I was losing my balance or

1958
01:49:35,991 --> 01:49:39,770
I was losing something of power or it
was putting more strain on one area the

1959
01:49:39,771 --> 01:49:44,360
other and making it harder. And I'm just
like, this translates so well, you know,

1960
01:49:45,050 --> 01:49:48,010
even when I do ballet,
it's like, you know,

1961
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:51,730
I can see when I'm off balance when um,
you know,

1962
01:49:52,210 --> 01:49:54,730
as one of the things and ballets
as you spend in, you know,

1963
01:49:54,731 --> 01:49:56,920
keep your eyes on there
so you don't get dizzy.

1964
01:49:57,130 --> 01:50:00,940
So even when proposal he kicked me,
I just made sure I saw four of them,

1965
01:50:01,060 --> 01:50:05,050
but I'm like, let me keep my eyes
on this motherfucker. He's like,

1966
01:50:05,260 --> 01:50:06,910
stay on of it.
But it all,

1967
01:50:06,911 --> 01:50:10,970
it all translate because it's all the
human body is called the same thing. Yeah.

1968
01:50:11,260 --> 01:50:11,561
You know,

1969
01:50:11,561 --> 01:50:16,180
it's just different ways of expressing
the way your body moves and what it does.

1970
01:50:16,181 --> 01:50:19,960
But it's the same shit. It says it's
only one, it's like a giant computer.

1971
01:50:20,110 --> 01:50:22,960
And I would think that learning all
these different ways to move would just

1972
01:50:22,961 --> 01:50:27,010
enhance your overall understanding of
how your body works and it makes you,

1973
01:50:27,130 --> 01:50:29,620
I think it like makes you more in
tune with it too. You know what,

1974
01:50:29,621 --> 01:50:32,350
I may get healthy.
That's one of the biggest keys.

1975
01:50:32,351 --> 01:50:36,310
I think it's just being as healthy as
as possible. And not, uh, you know,

1976
01:50:36,480 --> 01:50:40,240
tamper on with that too much for sure.
And also flexibility.

1977
01:50:40,241 --> 01:50:44,080
I think having flexibility is so
important. They are a fighter, you know,

1978
01:50:44,081 --> 01:50:47,710
being able to move your body. Like there's
some people that just aren't flexible,

1979
01:50:47,711 --> 01:50:50,000
they just can't move in certain ways.
And you know,

1980
01:50:50,020 --> 01:50:52,960
I can tell from watching you throw
head kicks and not fight. Like you're,

1981
01:50:52,970 --> 01:50:53,860
you're flexible.

1982
01:50:54,520 --> 01:50:57,440
You don't have a lot of tension in your
legs when you're doing that. You know,

1983
01:50:57,640 --> 01:50:58,870
I think tension is that,

1984
01:50:58,900 --> 01:51:03,700
is that it's like the perfect word for
it really is because that's what causes

1985
01:51:03,701 --> 01:51:06,510
you to tighten to, yeah. Like
when you got, when a guys,

1986
01:51:06,640 --> 01:51:08,500
it's difficult for him
to throw a body kick.

1987
01:51:08,501 --> 01:51:11,340
Can you see him kind of like lean
in and you see the instructor?

1988
01:51:12,250 --> 01:51:15,160
I loved Dan Henderson,
big fan. I've got to say,

1989
01:51:15,220 --> 01:51:19,570
you can even touch his toes when he
threw a head kick in the Hector lumbar

1990
01:51:19,571 --> 01:51:22,480
finals. Like Holy Shit.
But it's the way he

1991
01:51:24,010 --> 01:51:27,160
takes a lot of,
you know,

1992
01:51:27,161 --> 01:51:31,690
whereas some people throw head kicks and
you don't even see it coming. Yeah. Yeah.

1993
01:51:32,170 --> 01:51:34,450
And, and also Lynn and
grappling into, you know,

1994
01:51:34,451 --> 01:51:38,590
you have to be able to have
strength I think in every direction.

1995
01:51:39,070 --> 01:51:41,830
That's one of the biggest reason why I
don't lift weights as cause you get so

1996
01:51:41,831 --> 01:51:46,660
used to in that one uniform direction,
you have to be able to move.

1997
01:51:46,750 --> 01:51:49,660
I have to be just as strong
here as I am here as I am there.

1998
01:51:49,940 --> 01:51:53,260
Do you get all your resistance
from just grappling or from these,

1999
01:51:53,290 --> 01:51:57,110
these calisthenics and plow metrics
and different things? Grappling a lot.

2000
01:51:57,820 --> 01:52:01,600
Just pick guys up and put them
down. So it's concise. It does 100%.

2001
01:52:01,660 --> 01:52:04,540
A lot of body weight to 100% exercise.

2002
01:52:05,110 --> 01:52:10,020
Now did they concentrate on like
specific core exercises or do you know,

2003
01:52:10,030 --> 01:52:14,080
do you, do you have days where you
concentrate on just using your legs or uh,

2004
01:52:14,440 --> 01:52:18,550
yeah, different, different days dependent.
We do. We do do a lot of core stuff,

2005
01:52:18,551 --> 01:52:21,160
especially recently. Uh, probably
like the last year or so,

2006
01:52:21,161 --> 01:52:25,450
we've been doing a lot more, uh, with
the core. Uh, legs is a, is a huge one.

2007
01:52:25,451 --> 01:52:29,800
You know, your legs carry pretty much
the whole way. Kills. Yeah. Yeah. I mean,

2008
01:52:30,100 --> 01:52:34,710
I live in Henderson, so it's like,
you know, a lot of hills, but, um,

2009
01:52:35,500 --> 01:52:38,290
legs is one of the biggest,
just even my movement,

2010
01:52:38,410 --> 01:52:42,910
like the way you move to a lot of times
I'll notice how I'll be to, you know,

2011
01:52:42,911 --> 01:52:47,000
up on the balls on my feet or
I'll be too flat on, on my heels.

2012
01:52:47,210 --> 01:52:50,070
So as you know, I think that came
from wrestling a little bit though.

2013
01:52:50,200 --> 01:52:51,810
The stances are different.
Um,

2014
01:52:52,080 --> 01:52:57,080
but it's just rounding out me as a
individual is going to round out me as a

2015
01:52:57,561 --> 01:53:00,230
fighter, which has just
gone make it bigger, better.

2016
01:53:00,320 --> 01:53:04,010
Do you watch fights outside of MMA?
Do you watch kickbox 100%.

2017
01:53:04,910 --> 01:53:06,890
What do you like to
watch? Love Him. I mean,

2018
01:53:06,891 --> 01:53:10,670
I watch a lot of the big box and
fights, especially, I barely,

2019
01:53:10,671 --> 01:53:14,510
I only got to see like little clips and
pieces of the Broner and, and, and uh,

2020
01:53:14,511 --> 01:53:19,360
I was paying more attention
to his arguments with fits
rapper kid. That's six EA.

2021
01:53:19,380 --> 01:53:21,940
You're going back and forth and look
what the fuck is wrong with Andrew Brown

2022
01:53:21,960 --> 01:53:25,430
and he's entertaining this. The week
of the fight talking shit on Instagram.

2023
01:53:25,460 --> 01:53:28,910
I think they were just doing their
thing, making it, making media. Uh,

2024
01:53:28,970 --> 01:53:33,200
I think it was bullshit because he came
out to six nines a song and it's six,

2025
01:53:33,201 --> 01:53:36,650
nine kind of like shouted it out for
Broner. Came out to six, nine songs,

2026
01:53:36,890 --> 01:53:39,440
came out to the solid during the fight.
I haven't seen the video yet.

2027
01:53:39,441 --> 01:53:42,270
I got to go back and listen and go
on, go on. Six, nine, his Instagram,

2028
01:53:42,350 --> 01:53:47,000
he posted it up. Hilarious. So 69
changes to now. He likes Broner. I mean,

2029
01:53:47,001 --> 01:53:50,680
look at it. He was shouting, Gopros,
smart move. I mean they did they pay.

2030
01:53:52,450 --> 01:53:55,130
He actually, you know,
brought her is a he,

2031
01:53:56,120 --> 01:53:57,970
I mean he did his thing
and in that fight too,

2032
01:53:58,140 --> 01:54:00,730
he outworked Jesse Vargas
that that's hard to do. Uh,

2033
01:54:00,810 --> 01:54:03,610
I heard he beat the hell out of
them at the after eight rounds. Uh,

2034
01:54:03,710 --> 01:54:06,590
he beat out the hell out of him for
the last four, so I have to watch it,

2035
01:54:07,190 --> 01:54:11,900
watch it to home. I wanted to watch
your fight and Frankie's fight and um,

2036
01:54:12,410 --> 01:54:17,090
and uh, David Branch man knocking out
to, I'll go Santos like that. Holy Shit.

2037
01:54:17,320 --> 01:54:20,450
Branch is tough, but he's a bad
motherfucker. Do People Sleep on branch?

2038
01:54:20,451 --> 01:54:24,070
Cause he lost to Luke Rockhold.
Luke Rockhold is a fucking beast,

2039
01:54:24,071 --> 01:54:25,030
especially on top.

2040
01:54:27,920 --> 01:54:32,000
He got Weidman down on the
ground. By the way. Luke Rockhold,

2041
01:54:32,001 --> 01:54:34,510
we fought Weidman had staff. He was, yeah,

2042
01:54:34,550 --> 01:54:37,370
he was going through his fucking the
antibiotics. He was two weeks out. He's,

2043
01:54:37,380 --> 01:54:41,440
he's in like serious fucking IV
antibiotics. The whole deal. He was,

2044
01:54:41,540 --> 01:54:45,800
he was really hurting man. And that's no
joke. I mean he had the fight with Tony.

2045
01:54:45,801 --> 01:54:50,750
I was out for six weeks. I couldn't do
anything. I was, I got stabbed twice,

2046
01:54:50,780 --> 01:54:54,860
but I got it once and they caught it
real early when I got it the second time.

2047
01:54:55,580 --> 01:54:59,090
The second time barely even affected
me because it caught it so early.

2048
01:54:59,270 --> 01:55:03,890
But the first time I got it,
I got on the heavy medication and man,

2049
01:55:03,891 --> 01:55:08,780
I was like dizzy and I wasn't even
train and I stopped training after I,

2050
01:55:08,880 --> 01:55:12,740
I got on the medication. I just just, just
hung around and I was just like, Jesus,

2051
01:55:12,800 --> 01:55:16,550
the first couple of days on
the medication, I'm dizzy.
I'm like, I feel terrible.

2052
01:55:16,590 --> 01:55:19,550
It destroys your body. I mean,
especially when you talk to, I mean,

2053
01:55:19,551 --> 01:55:21,300
you've taught so many
microbiologists that,

2054
01:55:21,301 --> 01:55:25,310
that tell you what it does to the gut
flora. I didn't know back then either.

2055
01:55:25,311 --> 01:55:29,240
I got it back in like 2010.
What the fuck?

2056
01:55:29,250 --> 01:55:32,470
Y'All don't know shit
about gut flora back then.

2057
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:36,290
I literally didn't know what it was.
So I just took the medication,

2058
01:55:36,291 --> 01:55:40,010
just ate what I always ate.
Took some vitamins like I
always did and that was it.

2059
01:55:40,011 --> 01:55:44,190
But I was like, wow, like lightheaded.
Yeah. Yeah. No, it's no, it's no joke. Uh,

2060
01:55:44,280 --> 01:55:48,000
none of the body and it's,
that shit scares the fuck out of me,

2061
01:55:48,260 --> 01:55:52,560
Marissa and staff and those
fucking infections. They
scared the shit out of me,

2062
01:55:52,561 --> 01:55:56,100
man. Anything from within you?
It's Kinda, it's Kinda scary. Yeah.

2063
01:55:56,500 --> 01:55:59,910
That was fucking little monsters. Just
want to take over your body and eat it.

2064
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,310
You know, that's what it is. There's
more of them than there are of us.

2065
01:56:02,311 --> 01:56:03,144
I mean there's more,

2066
01:56:03,150 --> 01:56:07,500
there's more bacteria in your body than
there are human cells. Yeah. I mean it's,

2067
01:56:07,560 --> 01:56:10,980
it's crazy to think about
it, but it, but it just,

2068
01:56:12,540 --> 01:56:16,620
it's all about balance. You know what I
mean? You, you careful with your diet.

2069
01:56:16,621 --> 01:56:18,890
Like do you take in a lot
of probiotics and, yeah.

2070
01:56:19,680 --> 01:56:22,970
Especially when they can't make very,
very careful or maybe outside of it.

2071
01:56:23,490 --> 01:56:27,600
Recently I've been going a lot more,
uh, Kido a little bit, you know,

2072
01:56:27,601 --> 01:56:32,100
I still eat carbs obviously because I
have to for to have that explosion still.

2073
01:56:32,101 --> 01:56:33,720
I feel like,
just think you do,

2074
01:56:33,721 --> 01:56:36,990
I think you have to eat more carbs and
you probably still stay key to genic.

2075
01:56:37,380 --> 01:56:39,900
I think that when people look
at carbs and they say like,

2076
01:56:40,140 --> 01:56:43,020
you only have 25 to 50 grams
of carbs during the day.

2077
01:56:43,020 --> 01:56:48,020
Like that's great if you're not doing
two a days and fucking wrestling and run

2078
01:56:48,561 --> 01:56:51,780
and hills and shit. Like you body probably
needs more carbohydrates than that.

2079
01:56:51,900 --> 01:56:55,680
Yeah. I mean definitely.
Uh, and that, that's kind of
where I try and supplement it,

2080
01:56:55,681 --> 01:56:57,550
especially before I trained,
you know,

2081
01:56:57,990 --> 01:57:01,660
trying to eat more carbs and then I kind
of cut them back towards the end of the

2082
01:57:01,660 --> 01:57:05,330
day. Is it, what are you eating? A lot
of chicken is a lot of, uh, because I,

2083
01:57:05,340 --> 01:57:10,150
I can't eat fish or shellfish.
So a lot of chicken. A lot
of, uh, yeah, largely. Yeah,

2084
01:57:10,170 --> 01:57:15,090
completely. Oh really? Wow.
Yeah. It's a lobster shit. Yeah.

2085
01:57:16,190 --> 01:57:19,430
I mean, I just convince myself it
takes like shit anyway, but it doesn't,

2086
01:57:19,500 --> 01:57:24,000
I mean I could, I could look at it,
I'm sure with melted butter. Ooh.

2087
01:57:24,280 --> 01:57:26,670
It tastes like melted
butter. Oh, it's so good.

2088
01:57:26,940 --> 01:57:31,050
Lobster with either melted butter
on like some, some grass fed steak.

2089
01:57:31,410 --> 01:57:35,730
Well that was pretty fucking good too.
I love to cook. I love it. Cause I mean,

2090
01:57:35,760 --> 01:57:38,820
I think there's a real
art to cook it into. Uh,

2091
01:57:39,330 --> 01:57:42,150
that could probably be me
and another life. A chef.

2092
01:57:42,151 --> 01:57:46,920
He was saying that one person, that's a
hard to it. Right? Yeah. I would love to,

2093
01:57:47,010 --> 01:57:50,040
uh, you know, eventually
maybe we'll see. I Cook a lot.

2094
01:57:50,070 --> 01:57:52,380
I love cooking and it makes
me feel good, man. I like,

2095
01:57:52,470 --> 01:57:56,100
I like knowing that I prepared a meal
together. It's just, it's a nice thing,

2096
01:57:56,150 --> 01:57:59,180
especially if it's healthy and
especially when you, you know, I don't,

2097
01:57:59,181 --> 01:58:03,400
I don't get people that are, I mean,
I don't want to say I don't get Vegas.

2098
01:58:04,520 --> 01:58:07,860
Like I have a lot of friends
that are Vegan and, and you know,

2099
01:58:07,861 --> 01:58:10,080
I never kinda down,

2100
01:58:10,110 --> 01:58:15,030
but the fact that they don't want to
eat meat for, there are certain people,

2101
01:58:15,060 --> 01:58:17,160
like my brother tried to do this too.
He's like,

2102
01:58:17,161 --> 01:58:20,680
he don't want to eat meat because he's
like afraid of the animal, you know,

2103
01:58:20,750 --> 01:58:24,610
or feel bad for the animal itself.
It's just like you said,

2104
01:58:24,660 --> 01:58:28,450
we've got more not us
sales then we do us sales.

2105
01:58:28,910 --> 01:58:31,650
Like we're all the same shit.
You know what I mean? Even the,

2106
01:58:31,800 --> 01:58:34,350
even the animals like we are the same,
you know?

2107
01:58:34,351 --> 01:58:38,820
So I mean it's the same as the plants
don't want animal cruelty. I mean,

2108
01:58:38,821 --> 01:58:42,460
I think of course that's what
most, the, the most noble aspects

2109
01:58:42,460 --> 01:58:46,360
of becoming a Vegan is to avoid
animal cruelty and factory farming.

2110
01:58:46,690 --> 01:58:49,930
And I think that that in that way,
I agree with them.

2111
01:58:49,931 --> 01:58:54,280
The real problem with vegans is that
there's a certain percentage of them that

2112
01:58:54,281 --> 01:58:57,850
are just fucking idiots and it's just
a certain percentage of any group of

2113
01:58:57,851 --> 01:59:01,060
people. It's not most vegans,
most vegans are kind people.

2114
01:59:01,690 --> 01:59:05,110
It's a certain percentage of them that
are using being a Vegan as an excuse to

2115
01:59:05,111 --> 01:59:07,720
be a fucking asshole. And that's
what it is. And they just,

2116
01:59:07,780 --> 01:59:11,260
they have this thing and most of
them use Vegan in their screen name.

2117
01:59:11,280 --> 01:59:16,280
They always have like the vegans a part
of their identity and then they attack

2118
01:59:17,411 --> 01:59:20,110
people who aren't vegans.
There's a few people that have followed.

2119
01:59:20,111 --> 01:59:23,650
I literally go to their Twitter page
and just watch them attack people who

2120
01:59:23,651 --> 01:59:27,070
aren't vegans. Yeah. I mean it's crazy to
watch. It's just like that's all they do.

2121
01:59:27,170 --> 01:59:28,390
And, and like you said, it's, it's,

2122
01:59:28,510 --> 01:59:31,600
that's why I don't want to say like I
don't understand Vegas cause that's just

2123
01:59:31,601 --> 01:59:35,600
people in general. You get
that. Yeah. You're going to
get that in any walk Sjoberg

2124
01:59:35,890 --> 01:59:39,790
be fucking idiots.
And it's almost like when I've said that,

2125
01:59:39,791 --> 01:59:41,290
like veganism is sort of a religion.

2126
01:59:41,890 --> 01:59:46,840
It's an ideology in the sense of the way
some people practice it that they want

2127
01:59:46,841 --> 01:59:50,530
to go after. There's some people that are
Catholic that Hate Protestants, right?

2128
01:59:50,710 --> 01:59:53,290
So they think the Protestants are
the enemy. And then this is just,

2129
01:59:53,291 --> 01:59:56,860
I mean this is obviously something that
went on for a long time in human history,

2130
01:59:57,040 --> 02:00:01,540
but I think it's just groups of people
get real tribal. And then, you know,

2131
02:00:01,541 --> 02:00:04,450
the fucking Yankees hate the red
sox and this is just how it goes.

2132
02:00:04,660 --> 02:00:07,960
And these people just decide that
you're on the other team, so fuck you.

2133
02:00:08,200 --> 02:00:12,450
And no one can see any middle ground.
You know,

2134
02:00:12,460 --> 02:00:14,110
there's this guy from this restaurant,
uh,

2135
02:00:14,230 --> 02:00:19,230
antler from Toronto I had on last week
and these people are protesting his

2136
02:00:19,331 --> 02:00:21,490
restaurant, these vegans. Oh, I seen that.

2137
02:00:22,260 --> 02:00:25,930
They want him to put a sign in
the window saying something like,

2138
02:00:25,931 --> 02:00:29,830
no animal should die so that we live and
it's not our right to take their lives

2139
02:00:29,831 --> 02:00:33,970
on like, and so they're like the
protest every week until he does it.

2140
02:00:33,990 --> 02:00:36,400
But he's not going to do it. Yeah.
So what the fuck are you doing?

2141
02:00:36,401 --> 02:00:39,310
Like what is this like where's this,
they've just asked. There's, there's,

2142
02:00:40,120 --> 02:00:44,230
there's an ideological battle going on,
you know, and they're not, it's not,

2143
02:00:44,290 --> 02:00:46,210
it doesn't,
it's not a thought,

2144
02:00:46,211 --> 02:00:50,950
well like examined objective thing in my,
in my opinion.

2145
02:00:51,080 --> 02:00:52,980
Yeah. But it's so natural
though, like you said,

2146
02:00:53,090 --> 02:00:56,160
is it's almost like communities
[inaudible] you know, is,

2147
02:00:56,180 --> 02:00:59,120
is you have your, your, your thoughts.

2148
02:00:59,121 --> 02:01:03,350
I've got my thoughts and we're part of
two separate communities and it's just

2149
02:01:03,351 --> 02:01:04,300
like with anything else,

2150
02:01:04,550 --> 02:01:09,550
I think that integration between the two
and that balance is like the most key

2151
02:01:10,131 --> 02:01:13,700
to everybody really. You kind of will
grow everybody, you know, the, the,

2152
02:01:13,880 --> 02:01:17,020
the bounty hunters can learn
something from the vegans.

2153
02:01:17,030 --> 02:01:19,100
Just much the vegans can learn
from the bombing hunters.

2154
02:01:19,101 --> 02:01:20,690
You know what I'm saying?
I think so too. You know,

2155
02:01:20,691 --> 02:01:24,470
and I think that really the problem is
when people don't want to hear the other

2156
02:01:24,471 --> 02:01:26,290
side and they want to shout people down,
they don't,

2157
02:01:26,390 --> 02:01:27,650
they're not willing to listen.
And there's,

2158
02:01:27,651 --> 02:01:32,390
there's common ground across the board.
And some of it probably is just learnt,

2159
02:01:32,540 --> 02:01:35,120
I think a lot about like how you grew up.

2160
02:01:35,600 --> 02:01:39,320
And I think it's important to like
understand that it's like I said,

2161
02:01:39,321 --> 02:01:41,540
just to go back to march,
how old it is,

2162
02:01:41,541 --> 02:01:44,090
just that's the way I grew up
and that's what I understood.

2163
02:01:44,091 --> 02:01:47,570
But when I look at like
my dad, you know, like my,

2164
02:01:47,640 --> 02:01:52,490
my dad didn't have his dad so, and
he was out the house by 15, you know,

2165
02:01:52,760 --> 02:01:57,760
he and I try and put myself
there sometimes being a 15
year old kid that didn't

2166
02:01:59,181 --> 02:02:02,060
have a place to go. Like,
what are you going to do?

2167
02:02:02,180 --> 02:02:06,140
And the only people you see around you
is, is drug dealers and, and in, in on us.

2168
02:02:07,280 --> 02:02:11,690
So like a lot of it I give credit to
him for sticking around for me because I

2169
02:02:11,691 --> 02:02:15,870
would have no, I've hit people over
Todd to hit. Right, right. You know,

2170
02:02:16,050 --> 02:02:18,080
you know what I mean? Uh,
and that's why people do it.

2171
02:02:18,380 --> 02:02:21,080
Because those people that are doing that
are just like you and me, everybody's,

2172
02:02:22,100 --> 02:02:25,550
we're all just human beings.
And we very genetically and we vary,

2173
02:02:25,551 --> 02:02:29,240
but we very more bar environment, how much
love we get. Yeah, yeah. That, that's a,

2174
02:02:29,250 --> 02:02:33,290
that's a big part of it is like
it's just the culture is, it's just,

2175
02:02:33,980 --> 02:02:34,490
you know,

2176
02:02:34,490 --> 02:02:39,490
and I think it stems from one culture
being separated from others and not having

2177
02:02:41,211 --> 02:02:42,440
that integration.

2178
02:02:42,740 --> 02:02:46,850
Then you get that like even more of a
disconnect and then once you get the even

2179
02:02:46,851 --> 02:02:50,390
bigger than, you know, it's, it's
all like downhill, more insecurity,

2180
02:02:50,391 --> 02:02:53,720
which leads to more tribalism and it's,
the whole thing is just,

2181
02:02:54,020 --> 02:02:56,420
it's so disappointing that
people still operate like this,

2182
02:02:56,421 --> 02:02:59,660
but I think people were opening
up to that more now than before.

2183
02:02:59,661 --> 02:03:02,330
I just think it's a slow process.
Slowly but surely,

2184
02:03:02,540 --> 02:03:04,350
slowly but surely we still working at it.
Yeah.

2185
02:03:04,690 --> 02:03:08,240
Know we were talking before about
the Rosa parks picture out there.

2186
02:03:08,241 --> 02:03:12,730
That wasn't that long ago man. No,
no, no. It really wasn't in it.

2187
02:03:12,850 --> 02:03:15,530
And that'd be the thing with certain,

2188
02:03:15,780 --> 02:03:18,740
there's certain white people too
that just be like, all right,

2189
02:03:18,741 --> 02:03:21,510
just get over it already. And
it's like, come on, like it,

2190
02:03:21,511 --> 02:03:26,400
they didn't have to get over it. Exactly.
They don't understand. Then you don't,

2191
02:03:26,420 --> 02:03:29,190
you truly don't understand.
Uh,

2192
02:03:29,630 --> 02:03:34,630
and you've don't even like take the time
to try and understand their tribal to,

2193
02:03:34,821 --> 02:03:37,790
they'd talked to other people that say
the same shit and like, yeah, well,

2194
02:03:37,970 --> 02:03:41,600
and they'll just start rattling off the
statistics about the instances of crime

2195
02:03:41,601 --> 02:03:44,870
in the black community and how the
Asians don't do this, but the blacks do.

2196
02:03:44,871 --> 02:03:47,630
It's like, it's fucking cultural.
If you don't think it's cultural,

2197
02:03:47,631 --> 02:03:50,030
you haven't been enough around enough
people and it does not go back.

2198
02:03:50,030 --> 02:03:53,240
A lot of generations. It's like you said,
the parts is not very long ago. You know,

2199
02:03:53,241 --> 02:03:54,530
my dad didn't have his dad.

2200
02:03:54,531 --> 02:03:58,520
He didn't have that person to teach him
what not to do and what to do. You know,

2201
02:03:58,521 --> 02:04:01,760
it's, it's, that's a, that's a, that's
a hard road, especially for a young,

2202
02:04:02,060 --> 02:04:05,650
like you go back earlier, like young
guys get delusional real quick. You know,

2203
02:04:05,690 --> 02:04:07,520
they feel invincible. He felt like, oh,

2204
02:04:07,521 --> 02:04:09,350
I can do this and I'm
never going to get caught.

2205
02:04:09,890 --> 02:04:14,780
You don't have that voice of reason
to tell you right from wrong when you,

2206
02:04:14,810 --> 02:04:17,810
when you that kind of age and it's because
he didn't have his dad and then why

2207
02:04:17,820 --> 02:04:20,550
didn't have his dad because he didn't
have his dad. You know what I mean?

2208
02:04:20,551 --> 02:04:22,700
And that only goes back two,
three generations.

2209
02:04:22,720 --> 02:04:27,050
And you know what's crazy is you are
talking about 1865 is when slavery was

2210
02:04:27,051 --> 02:04:27,531
abolished.

2211
02:04:27,531 --> 02:04:31,610
So we're talking about a small amount
of time in human history where there

2212
02:04:31,611 --> 02:04:34,120
haven't been slave.
So all your isolation when you,

2213
02:04:34,121 --> 02:04:37,670
you felt as a kid where you felt separate
from the people that were in those,

2214
02:04:37,671 --> 02:04:38,220
the miles

2215
02:04:38,220 --> 02:04:39,330
that were higher than yours.

2216
02:04:39,600 --> 02:04:44,600
Think about that times a hundred is if
you were a slave and maybe a million

2217
02:04:45,730 --> 02:04:46,563
remediate,

2218
02:04:46,720 --> 02:04:51,720
insurmountable gap between a slave that
has no chance of ever not being a slave.

2219
02:04:52,230 --> 02:04:55,560
And someone who can go to school wherever
they want and travel abroad abroad and

2220
02:04:55,561 --> 02:04:56,490
do whatever the fuck they want.

2221
02:04:56,730 --> 02:05:01,080
And then the idea that some of these white
people think that these people should

2222
02:05:01,081 --> 02:05:04,830
just get over it with the amount
of time is so fucking short.

2223
02:05:04,831 --> 02:05:08,040
You're talking about we just had
black panther, the lifestyle,

2224
02:05:08,820 --> 02:05:11,980
we just had it beat Avatar.
It's beating

2225
02:05:13,450 --> 02:05:17,150
one of the number one biggest
movies of all time. Stupid, big.

2226
02:05:17,180 --> 02:05:20,150
That should help.
Believe it or not,

2227
02:05:20,270 --> 02:05:22,450
I really think it would help.

2228
02:05:22,490 --> 02:05:25,580
It was a beautiful movie and it
was a beautiful movie to describe.

2229
02:05:25,581 --> 02:05:30,581
Even like when you say 1865 I feel
like we so disconnected from even that,

2230
02:05:32,420 --> 02:05:34,640
and this is,
I've talked to a lot of people about this,

2231
02:05:34,880 --> 02:05:38,450
the difference between being called a
black American and African American,

2232
02:05:38,451 --> 02:05:41,180
you know, I don't, I hate being
called an African American. I just,

2233
02:05:41,181 --> 02:05:45,590
that's what everybody says, but we know
it's just bothers it. Taped it to me, it,

2234
02:05:46,010 --> 02:05:49,550
it makes you seem, because you put
me in Francis' next to each other,

2235
02:05:49,640 --> 02:05:53,570
Frances and an African American, you
know what I mean? He's, he's from Africa.

2236
02:05:53,571 --> 02:05:58,430
He has ties to African. Who else is
in African American? Elon Musk. Yeah.

2237
02:05:58,431 --> 02:06:01,070
I mean, yeah. Really when you were ill.

2238
02:06:01,520 --> 02:06:05,060
But I think even more now it Kinda like

2239
02:06:06,560 --> 02:06:10,100
I just, why can't we be, the black
comes in so many different shades.

2240
02:06:10,370 --> 02:06:12,260
You know what I mean?
And this is African obviously,

2241
02:06:12,800 --> 02:06:14,690
so maybe black Americans
a better way to put it.

2242
02:06:14,960 --> 02:06:17,120
But Africans have ties to African,
you know what I'm saying?

2243
02:06:17,121 --> 02:06:19,580
Like black American slavery,
like we feel,

2244
02:06:19,640 --> 02:06:22,010
I feel we should have our ties in America.

2245
02:06:22,011 --> 02:06:24,510
Like I should be proud
to just be in American,

2246
02:06:24,530 --> 02:06:26,470
not be called the an
African American woman.

2247
02:06:27,520 --> 02:06:29,800
Well it's with every generation.
I mean it's,

2248
02:06:29,810 --> 02:06:33,190
it's going to take a long time before
we just abandoned all this nonsense and

2249
02:06:33,191 --> 02:06:36,070
just treat people based on
who they are as a human being.

2250
02:06:36,071 --> 02:06:40,030
But my grandparents came from Italy
and they were treated like dog shit.

2251
02:06:40,110 --> 02:06:43,900
And my grandfather always talked about
the racism that he encountered when he

2252
02:06:43,901 --> 02:06:45,850
came over from Italy to America.

2253
02:06:45,851 --> 02:06:48,940
And they didn't think of
Italians as white people.

2254
02:06:49,180 --> 02:06:54,180
Now they think of Italians is white
people 100% and Mexicans are experiencing

2255
02:06:54,251 --> 02:06:58,990
that. Like, you know, if you're from
Spain, you're basically white. Like,

2256
02:06:58,991 --> 02:07:02,830
nobody thinks of a guy
from Spain as being like,

2257
02:07:02,860 --> 02:07:05,190
you don't think of in the same
way you think of Mexicans,

2258
02:07:05,770 --> 02:07:10,420
but one day all that shit will go away.
One day we'll get past this,

2259
02:07:10,421 --> 02:07:13,060
whether it's who knows how
many generations it will take.

2260
02:07:13,061 --> 02:07:16,600
But I think it's changing now because of
the Internet. I think there's, there's,

2261
02:07:16,630 --> 02:07:20,080
there's definitely like more hate
groups that consolidate and they'd get

2262
02:07:20,081 --> 02:07:23,890
together and they, they, they, you know,
they, they live in an echo chamber online.

2263
02:07:23,891 --> 02:07:27,390
They talk, you know, and they agree
with each other. You see it on Twitter.

2264
02:07:27,540 --> 02:07:29,080
And Twitter's trying to stop that.

2265
02:07:29,081 --> 02:07:31,720
And maybe that's misguided
because maybe it strengthens it.

2266
02:07:31,721 --> 02:07:35,890
But I think that ultimately is the ability
to exchange information is going to

2267
02:07:35,891 --> 02:07:38,950
allow more and more people
to compare notes and, and,

2268
02:07:39,280 --> 02:07:42,040
and understand that there's no,

2269
02:07:42,340 --> 02:07:45,310
there's no benefit to describe or to,
to,

2270
02:07:45,311 --> 02:07:49,090
to thinking of people as being inferior
or superior or better or worse.

2271
02:07:49,300 --> 02:07:52,800
We're just all different. But we're
all human. We're all just humans

2272
02:07:52,870 --> 02:07:56,470
of all the same. I mean really, you
see that when you, when you see people,

2273
02:07:56,490 --> 02:07:59,450
you know, you can really see
somebody that you really know them.

2274
02:07:59,470 --> 02:08:03,610
You really see them. Yeah. It
is. We literally all the same

2275
02:08:04,050 --> 02:08:07,050
but all different too, because that's
one of the beautiful things is that you,

2276
02:08:07,051 --> 02:08:11,160
you see these little different
aspects of individual's personalities,

2277
02:08:11,310 --> 02:08:14,610
but to lump people in a group, Oh,
you know, you're a Chinese guy. Oh,

2278
02:08:14,611 --> 02:08:16,710
I know what the fuck you
are. You're this, oh,

2279
02:08:16,711 --> 02:08:20,160
you're an African guy on what the fuck
you are. You're this. No, that's nonsense.

2280
02:08:20,660 --> 02:08:24,810
There's a broad spectrum in each and
every classification, but at the,

2281
02:08:25,010 --> 02:08:27,870
at the end of the day, we're all the
same thing because we're all just people.

2282
02:08:27,960 --> 02:08:32,730
Yeah. Wait, what, 100% I mean, it's
just when you talk about heaven,

2283
02:08:33,150 --> 02:08:37,860
like pride in, in, in it I feel
like helps a little bit more if I,

2284
02:08:37,900 --> 02:08:40,830
if I identify with like as a black
American, you know, instead of,

2285
02:08:41,280 --> 02:08:43,920
instead of like an African American,
it's just see what you're saying.

2286
02:08:43,921 --> 02:08:47,160
You know what I mean? I feel like
I said a little more, you know,

2287
02:08:47,161 --> 02:08:48,780
I just look different,
you know what I mean?

2288
02:08:48,781 --> 02:08:53,781
Like I'm more integrated and it
would give me more pride to beat it.

2289
02:08:54,210 --> 02:08:57,060
You know what I'm saying?
And, and I think that's still,

2290
02:08:57,420 --> 02:09:00,690
you were obviously all the same
in there needs to be integration,

2291
02:09:00,691 --> 02:09:04,020
but you still have to have some type
of identity. You know what I'm saying?

2292
02:09:04,170 --> 02:09:05,880
I know what you're saying. Yeah. I mean,

2293
02:09:05,940 --> 02:09:09,400
and I think that the movie in itself
did a good job. Uh, I don't know.

2294
02:09:09,450 --> 02:09:11,370
I just went back to Black Panther,
Black Panther.

2295
02:09:11,520 --> 02:09:14,160
I think it did a great job in
describing like the differences,

2296
02:09:14,340 --> 02:09:19,320
there are differences between the black
community and the African and African

2297
02:09:19,320 --> 02:09:23,490
Community. You know what I mean?
Or African Africa itself and it,

2298
02:09:24,060 --> 02:09:28,350
because you get that,
you get that like anger,

2299
02:09:28,530 --> 02:09:29,363
you know what I mean?

2300
02:09:29,780 --> 02:09:33,480
Like that's like the stereotype
is like the black angry black man.

2301
02:09:33,960 --> 02:09:38,960
But some of it stems from not no one
where you're from and not having that core

2302
02:09:39,691 --> 02:09:40,524
identity.

2303
02:09:41,580 --> 02:09:45,510
And I feel like we can just do that
again here in America as black Americans

2304
02:09:45,511 --> 02:09:46,250
instead of,

2305
02:09:46,250 --> 02:09:49,610
I hope. Yeah. I hope
what it represents is a,

2306
02:09:49,760 --> 02:09:53,420
it's a meter to register
that racism is dying. Yeah.

2307
02:09:53,600 --> 02:09:56,900
And that this is,
this is also people in,

2308
02:09:56,901 --> 02:10:00,710
there's a lot of like white people that
were going way out of their way to go

2309
02:10:00,711 --> 02:10:03,740
see it because they wanted to show
everybody that they're not racist.

2310
02:10:03,741 --> 02:10:07,070
But I think that's good
too. Yeah. Ultimately it's,

2311
02:10:07,071 --> 02:10:12,071
it's showing that this is something that
people recognize as a stupid problem

2312
02:10:12,291 --> 02:10:13,370
and we should get past it.

2313
02:10:13,670 --> 02:10:18,000
It took God damn long enough.
You done, I mean, what,

2314
02:10:18,030 --> 02:10:20,870
we're probably going to be telling this
to our grandchildren and they're still

2315
02:10:20,871 --> 02:10:22,280
going to be experiencing some of it.

2316
02:10:22,340 --> 02:10:24,340
And then there's going to be something
new comes out and be like, God,

2317
02:10:24,710 --> 02:10:28,780
we just now doing this. Like, you know,
that's the way it's just going to be. Uh,

2318
02:10:28,990 --> 02:10:33,290
but for me personally, you know,
he's just eight cause everybody,

2319
02:10:33,320 --> 02:10:36,020
every kid wants to be a sober here. I'm
like, oh, how are you doing? You know? So

2320
02:10:36,980 --> 02:10:39,050
a lot of them, you can be half
of the empire and be blade.

2321
02:10:39,300 --> 02:10:42,810
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, yeah, but played was
like a hit man. You know what I mean?

2322
02:10:43,160 --> 02:10:46,200
It goes back to what you see
around me. If I only see the, the,

2323
02:10:46,400 --> 02:10:49,300
the drug dealers and the,
you know, in every, you know,

2324
02:10:49,310 --> 02:10:52,070
there was never a black superhero and it
was like, all right, well shit. All right.

2325
02:10:52,610 --> 02:10:55,590
You know, we didn't go
up there, Huh? Yeah.

2326
02:10:55,730 --> 02:10:59,520
And it portrayed us as scientists
or, you know, it was a loud, I just

2327
02:11:00,700 --> 02:11:04,180
white get over it guys. That doesn't
register for you cause they're all white.

2328
02:11:04,240 --> 02:11:08,120
Every fucking superhero. Batman,
spider man. Even the Hawk is white oak

2329
02:11:08,180 --> 02:11:12,790
first. Yeah. And I mean, I, and
I, I get it from a lot of it.

2330
02:11:12,850 --> 02:11:15,200
I mean there's just, it's just
culture. You know what I mean?

2331
02:11:15,201 --> 02:11:19,310
And it's not better or worse than one
thing or another. You know, there,

2332
02:11:19,311 --> 02:11:21,570
there's Hawaiian culture,
there's, there's, you know,

2333
02:11:22,820 --> 02:11:27,440
it's just culture and it just,
that needs to be celebrated too,

2334
02:11:27,441 --> 02:11:30,200
because the more you celebrate culture,
the more you can integrate between

2335
02:11:30,670 --> 02:11:32,680
all of them. Right. And then
there's the real problem with,

2336
02:11:32,681 --> 02:11:34,700
I don't want those cultures to go away.
Yeah.

2337
02:11:34,970 --> 02:11:38,830
I was in Chinatown in Boston this
weekend and we went and ate dinner at two

2338
02:11:38,831 --> 02:11:42,310
o'clock in the morning. It's Chinese
restaurant. It's China town, right? Jamie?

2339
02:11:42,580 --> 02:11:46,080
What that place was? China
town, they got like fucking, uh,

2340
02:11:46,100 --> 02:11:49,780
Alaskan king crabs and a fish tank. Like,
how the fuck did you even get that here?

2341
02:11:49,970 --> 02:11:50,920
It's still alive.

2342
02:11:51,070 --> 02:11:54,730
All these fish on top of each other and
they pull the fish out of the tank and

2343
02:11:54,731 --> 02:11:59,200
cook it up for you. I mean, it's like
they barely speak English. I mean,

2344
02:11:59,220 --> 02:12:04,030
this is their culture and I want that to
still exist too. You know what I mean?

2345
02:12:04,180 --> 02:12:05,590
I just want them to be accepted

2346
02:12:05,690 --> 02:12:08,370
100% I mean, and, and
that's the beauty about it.

2347
02:12:08,371 --> 02:12:10,370
And I think you need to keep that alive.
You know,

2348
02:12:10,371 --> 02:12:13,360
there's two different spectrums to it.
There's the, there's the, the person,

2349
02:12:13,361 --> 02:12:15,130
it's just like, oh, just go
ahead and get over it. Right.

2350
02:12:15,140 --> 02:12:18,140
And there is a person that just like,
okay, what you don't even have, like,

2351
02:12:18,141 --> 02:12:19,950
they don't want even like,
uh,

2352
02:12:20,060 --> 02:12:24,830
like I did it or acknowledge your culture,
you know what I mean?

2353
02:12:24,831 --> 02:12:27,920
They just want to like, just
shun it or just not, you know,

2354
02:12:28,100 --> 02:12:32,300
just put it in a closet somewhere
and you know that that's almost the,

2355
02:12:32,420 --> 02:12:35,610
it's the opposite, but it's just
as bad as just needs to be though.

2356
02:12:35,710 --> 02:12:38,500
A buddy of mine who lives on
the big island about that,

2357
02:12:38,501 --> 02:12:41,860
he's a white guy and he lives in Hawaii
and he grew up in Hawaii and I said,

2358
02:12:41,861 --> 02:12:44,890
did you experience a lot of racism
against white people? He's like, no,

2359
02:12:44,891 --> 02:12:48,790
cause I'm not a fucking asshole. And I
said, that's what it is, right? It's like,

2360
02:12:48,791 --> 02:12:52,320
yeah, man. He goes, you can't be a white
guy coming over here trying to push your,

2361
02:12:52,350 --> 02:12:56,200
uh, you know, mainland culture is like,
this is the fucking culture dude. He goes,

2362
02:12:56,201 --> 02:12:58,720
if you just accept the culture
the way it is out here, he goes,

2363
02:12:58,721 --> 02:13:00,680
they're not racist.
Let's see if you can get a good,

2364
02:13:00,700 --> 02:13:03,390
you could gonna run into a few,
but for the most part you're

2365
02:13:03,390 --> 02:13:05,920
going to run into a few eight everywhere
you go. Because people were like,

2366
02:13:05,921 --> 02:13:09,470
you got to go back to it. Like people are
fucking idiots in every walks of it. Uh,

2367
02:13:09,730 --> 02:13:12,720
but for the most part it's always, you're
not. It has no you good. Right. I mean,

2368
02:13:12,780 --> 02:13:15,160
and this,
it's the same way across the board.

2369
02:13:15,161 --> 02:13:17,530
And I've kind of realized that as I'm,
as I'm getting older,

2370
02:13:17,531 --> 02:13:22,350
because before I just thought, you
know, we've just what we are. Right.

2371
02:13:22,390 --> 02:13:26,050
You know what I mean? I've got family
members that only will ever see Detroit.

2372
02:13:26,260 --> 02:13:28,030
They will only ever see those same blocks.

2373
02:13:28,031 --> 02:13:32,640
They will only ever see the same people.
And that's just what you think it is.

2374
02:13:32,700 --> 02:13:35,790
And it's just like, oh, so much
now there's so much, much more.

2375
02:13:35,791 --> 02:13:40,791
And it's not that different that you
think is different is it's different.

2376
02:13:41,640 --> 02:13:45,590
But you know what I'm saying? It's
not, it's not alien. It's just,

2377
02:13:45,610 --> 02:13:48,150
it's just different. It's just different.
It's not better. It's not worse.

2378
02:13:48,280 --> 02:13:51,370
One of the things that I really enjoyed
about traveling so much with the UFC,

2379
02:13:51,371 --> 02:13:54,280
as you got to see all these different
cultures and you got to see all these

2380
02:13:54,281 --> 02:13:57,760
different styles of life that
these people live in and you know,

2381
02:13:57,761 --> 02:14:00,730
you kind of like put it all together
and you, you, it just gives you,

2382
02:14:01,360 --> 02:14:04,720
I think this is one of the best things
about traveling is that it gives you this

2383
02:14:04,780 --> 02:14:08,830
more rounded perspective.
Like if you lived in Italy,

2384
02:14:08,831 --> 02:14:12,040
you'd be like one of these people, if this
is how they live, they live like this.

2385
02:14:12,340 --> 02:14:15,640
You know, if you lived in Dublin,
you'd be like this, this is,

2386
02:14:15,641 --> 02:14:16,960
this is their style of living.

2387
02:14:17,240 --> 02:14:17,661
Yeah.
And it's,

2388
02:14:17,661 --> 02:14:21,320
and it's important to acknowledge I
think all those different styles until,

2389
02:14:21,330 --> 02:14:24,760
you know, and of living.
Uh, and that, and,

2390
02:14:24,761 --> 02:14:28,610
and I think if you really want to like
cure racism in American, all that,

2391
02:14:28,611 --> 02:14:32,990
and it's just being open about it
and just talking and, you know,

2392
02:14:32,991 --> 02:14:36,250
people understand other
people's upbringing is,

2393
02:14:36,251 --> 02:14:39,590
and what they went through and what they
do because that makes you understand it

2394
02:14:39,591 --> 02:14:43,760
more if you try and just shun it away or
just say if you even bring up the word

2395
02:14:43,761 --> 02:14:46,850
black or white or it's anything like
people get, you know, you kind of see it.

2396
02:14:46,851 --> 02:14:50,070
Sometimes people get tense and
it's just like, just, just,

2397
02:14:50,870 --> 02:14:54,710
just be honest about it and just be open
about it. And that will make it go away.

2398
02:14:54,711 --> 02:14:57,190
It's not, it's not, you know, shun it.

2399
02:14:57,690 --> 02:14:59,240
Well,
don't want to be uncomfortable.

2400
02:14:59,290 --> 02:15:01,010
They don't want to talk
about uncomfortable shit.

2401
02:15:01,040 --> 02:15:04,380
So if something comes up that's a, well,
you know, as a black man, you're like, oh,

2402
02:15:05,730 --> 02:15:09,800
here we go. I didn't do it.
Okay. I never had a slave. Okay.

2403
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:12,530
You know, and you're like, all right man,

2404
02:15:12,560 --> 02:15:15,760
you just super uncomfortable
with being uncomfortable. You,

2405
02:15:16,670 --> 02:15:19,240
I think that makes you that more
of the ass over there. You know,

2406
02:15:19,241 --> 02:15:20,480
you're talking to a human being.

2407
02:15:20,481 --> 02:15:22,340
If you really want to have
a conversation with them,

2408
02:15:22,341 --> 02:15:24,620
you want to know their actual experience.
You know?

2409
02:15:24,621 --> 02:15:28,250
And if their experience is as a Puerto
Rican that came from Puerto Rico,

2410
02:15:28,251 --> 02:15:28,860
that feels disc,

2411
02:15:28,860 --> 02:15:32,330
a lot of Puerto Ricans feel
super disconnected with
the United States because

2412
02:15:32,331 --> 02:15:36,860
they're not really United States citizens,
but they are, it's like a weird thing.

2413
02:15:36,861 --> 02:15:39,590
It's Kinda like, it's not
really a state, but it's,

2414
02:15:39,591 --> 02:15:43,190
it's of protected by the United States.
And so they're disconnected.

2415
02:15:43,191 --> 02:15:45,790
And there's a, like on the east
coast growing up with Puerto Ricans,

2416
02:15:46,040 --> 02:15:48,320
there's a weird,
they have a weird alienation.

2417
02:15:49,790 --> 02:15:52,610
If you don't want to talk to them and
you don't want to hear about that from

2418
02:15:52,611 --> 02:15:53,444
them,
that's fine,

2419
02:15:53,540 --> 02:15:56,900
but you're just going to miss out on
that part of what life is for them.

2420
02:15:57,140 --> 02:15:58,220
You're never going to get it.

2421
02:15:58,370 --> 02:16:00,600
Yeah. And all the things that
they bring to it, and you know,

2422
02:16:00,620 --> 02:16:04,040
the food that they bring that to
different arts, you know what I mean?

2423
02:16:04,050 --> 02:16:06,980
The different styles of fighting that
they bring, the different dances,

2424
02:16:06,981 --> 02:16:11,060
like everything is about the culture.
You're going to miss if you try and just,

2425
02:16:11,090 --> 02:16:13,190
you know,
shy away from it.

2426
02:16:13,700 --> 02:16:17,840
Martial arts is a perfect example of
like all these different cultures coming

2427
02:16:17,841 --> 02:16:20,820
together as one boiling pot.
Yeah.

2428
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:21,631
Yeah. I mean, and,

2429
02:16:21,631 --> 02:16:24,840
and that does help me get us one of
the most beautiful things about it.

2430
02:16:24,841 --> 02:16:29,841
It's just I can go over to Ireland and
fight a Russian in Ireland and you know,

2431
02:16:30,020 --> 02:16:34,660
is, it's different than going down to
Brazil then find the Brazilian, you know,

2432
02:16:34,661 --> 02:16:35,860
or something like that.
It's just sure.

2433
02:16:36,010 --> 02:16:39,760
But it's at the core of it is still is
fighting. It's just different styles of,

2434
02:16:39,880 --> 02:16:41,860
of being able to do it.
But everybody does it.

2435
02:16:41,890 --> 02:16:46,240
What's crazy to me is how when you go
to these other places like Brazil or

2436
02:16:46,241 --> 02:16:50,230
Ireland or something like that, like how
rabid they are for their local people.

2437
02:16:50,231 --> 02:16:54,220
Yeah, yeah. Well you find someone
who's Brazilian in Brazil.

2438
02:16:54,940 --> 02:16:57,040
I mean maybe it's
relaxed a little bit now,

2439
02:16:57,041 --> 02:17:00,860
but I was there for some of
the earlier years as well.

2440
02:17:00,880 --> 02:17:03,370
And I've made the mistake of
flipping off the crowd before, uh,

2441
02:17:03,460 --> 02:17:07,440
at the way is because, because
Lou, you down there, uh,

2442
02:17:07,570 --> 02:17:10,480
for Cisco Toronado Oh,
bottom. Yeah. So he, you know,

2443
02:17:10,510 --> 02:17:15,130
three times a Brazilian
kickboxing champion, a monstrous,

2444
02:17:15,131 --> 02:17:17,440
that was one of the, at the
height of his, you know,

2445
02:17:17,441 --> 02:17:20,290
he's on a seven fight win streak. He
was feeling good. He was, you know,

2446
02:17:20,291 --> 02:17:24,490
Kinda had his labs were on until he was,
he wasn't tough at a one 85 pound,

2447
02:17:24,491 --> 02:17:29,290
two big gates, big guru. A hit
like a truck too. But you know,

2448
02:17:29,291 --> 02:17:32,530
before the way is they, they scream at
you gonna die. And I'm like, all right,

2449
02:17:32,760 --> 02:17:36,470
you know, I, I'm a shit talker. So you,
you, you've talked that shit to be,

2450
02:17:36,480 --> 02:17:40,440
I'm giving it back to you.
I love loving it.

2451
02:17:40,640 --> 02:17:43,920
It was a good Dewey too.
I'm loving it,

2452
02:17:43,921 --> 02:17:47,680
but I mean they were rabid for that when
people were throwing stuff at me as I

2453
02:17:47,681 --> 02:17:52,540
was walking out, uh, I kinda just threw
my headphones in and just went to town.

2454
02:17:52,540 --> 02:17:55,210
But yeah, they got a lot of
pride in Brazil and they love it.

2455
02:17:55,280 --> 02:17:58,270
But lot around the world,
a lot of the the,

2456
02:17:58,570 --> 02:18:02,890
because I think they truly
appreciate the art of what they do.

2457
02:18:03,040 --> 02:18:06,580
And it is a representation of
the culture there. You know,

2458
02:18:06,790 --> 02:18:09,240
for sure what Jujitsu for
sure, for sure. When they,

2459
02:18:09,250 --> 02:18:12,340
when they get somebody that's Damien Maia,
you know,

2460
02:18:12,341 --> 02:18:16,810
they kind of stand behind that man because
he represents the art of it or just

2461
02:18:16,811 --> 02:18:19,540
MMA, a general, like they,
they appreciate the art of it.

2462
02:18:19,640 --> 02:18:23,190
Russia is appreciate the art of what
they do, you know, the Sabo and you know,

2463
02:18:23,290 --> 02:18:26,920
it's so deep rooted in a culture,
uh, in a, in American is due to,

2464
02:18:26,980 --> 02:18:28,840
I mean for the most part he's just,

2465
02:18:29,260 --> 02:18:33,730
we don't get as behind our
own fighters I think is, yeah,

2466
02:18:33,731 --> 02:18:36,130
we have a certain amount
of loyalty but we're,

2467
02:18:36,131 --> 02:18:40,600
so this is such an ambitious
country. Yeah. Hello. Hey,

2468
02:18:40,601 --> 02:18:42,370
you gotta win some money.

2469
02:18:42,670 --> 02:18:46,780
Know we're shy talks of shit.
And we're like,

2470
02:18:47,430 --> 02:18:50,130
well listen man, you're doing all
those things right now. Hello.

2471
02:18:50,230 --> 02:18:52,040
I'm trying to do it slowly but surely.

2472
02:18:52,870 --> 02:18:55,690
I think there was a good conversation
too cause I think people understand you

2473
02:18:55,691 --> 02:18:59,230
more now. Yeah. Get a better sense of
who you are. I got, I got a couple of,

2474
02:18:59,760 --> 02:19:03,310
you know, I've got a couple of layers
to view you got to do. You do, Kevin.

2475
02:19:03,490 --> 02:19:07,240
I really appreciate it,
man. I really enjoyed this
conversation puffers. All right.

2476
02:19:07,270 --> 02:19:08,710
That's it. Fuckers. See Ya.

2477
02:19:20,980 --> 02:19:21,813
Okay.

2478
02:19:23,470 --> 02:19:23,600
Hmm.
