1
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:09,883
Hi.

2
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,233
I've always been,

3
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,900
I've always been a fan of Jimi Hendrix,

4
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:16,770
but huge,

5
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:18,810
huge fan and I'm not just,

6
00:00:18,811 --> 00:00:20,400
I listened to his music all the time,

7
00:00:20,401 --> 00:00:20,901
which I do.

8
00:00:20,901 --> 00:00:24,960
I listen to Jimi Hendrix at least once
a week for the longest time when I would

9
00:00:24,961 --> 00:00:26,550
land in any city,

10
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:31,200
my landing music have landing music
that I put on the airport as soon as the

11
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:32,063
thing.

12
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:34,560
Boom.

13
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,060
Food child every time.

14
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,320
Fucking years.

15
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:37,530
Man.

16
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,920
I felt like the lungs time and that's
one of the reasons why I decided to call

17
00:00:41,921 --> 00:00:42,810
it a podcast.

18
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:50,930
Joe Rogan experience as [inaudible]
experience [inaudible] I saw

19
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:20,503
and what it is

20
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:27,130
his mugshot or uh,

21
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:27,660
you know,

22
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,130
a series of his mugshot.

23
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,040
Isn't it the same way he
was arrested in Toronto,

24
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:32,903
same photo.

25
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,200
It's just a bunch of images
of it is the hardest.

26
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:36,413
I don't know.

27
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,313
I don't give a fuck.

28
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,940
Don't even today Mike,

29
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:46,560
we've had some pretty epic podcast
for 10 might have the most efficacy.

30
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:47,791
Cool man.

31
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:48,061
Yeah,

32
00:01:48,061 --> 00:01:49,950
it was awesome in front of you that day.

33
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:50,931
Yeah.

34
00:01:50,931 --> 00:01:52,620
I think we've covered a lot.

35
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,320
I had the right mixture
of Alpha brain pills,

36
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,640
marijuana,

37
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,140
alcohol and coffee.

38
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,263
It's perfect.

39
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:00,460
Yeah.

40
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,440
We should add some vitamins.

41
00:02:01,441 --> 00:02:02,530
We didn't take it to the next level.

42
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:07,700
Here's a few times we were searching
for words if we have the vitamins.

43
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,543
Yeah.

44
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,473
Nailed it.

45
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,310
How old was he?

46
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,143
I think

47
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:14,260
he died when he was 27 what year?

48
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:19,740
That was 64 I think he died in 63
seeing that this is may one was with 69

49
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,620
Woodstock was 69 oh,

50
00:02:22,621 --> 00:02:23,840
it says may 60 votes.

51
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:26,730
I thought it was a four so [inaudible] 69

52
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,633
I think it died.

53
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,100
Not that much longer afterwards.

54
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:33,123
Right.

55
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,230
Shogun on his own farm
it like like a champ,

56
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,213
like a champ.

57
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,620
You saw late night.

58
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:45,600
Podcasts are fucking hit or miss.

59
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,800
Sometimes they work,

60
00:02:46,801 --> 00:02:47,634
sometimes they don't.

61
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:48,330
You know,

62
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:48,460
they're,

63
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:51,620
it's a different vibe and sometimes
people are tired and I've worked out,

64
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:53,280
worked in quotes.

65
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:55,163
It's not really work,

66
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,300
but I was out in the sun
all day and you know,

67
00:02:57,301 --> 00:02:58,380
you get a little,

68
00:02:58,670 --> 00:02:59,620
a little tired,

69
00:02:59,621 --> 00:03:00,454
loopy,

70
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,870
but you might have a weird fucking report.

71
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:04,540
Dude,

72
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,530
when we do podcasts,

73
00:03:05,531 --> 00:03:06,610
they get very strange.

74
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,500
I know it's not just the podcast,

75
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,010
every conversation.

76
00:03:11,011 --> 00:03:11,210
Yes.

77
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:12,010
Yeah,

78
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:13,000
we have gets weird.

79
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:13,210
Yeah.

80
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:17,080
We both go to places where we wouldn't
necessarily go without each other.

81
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:17,680
You know,

82
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,370
we might,

83
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:19,150
I don't know,

84
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:24,040
but I find myself there way more often
with you and super comfortable with it,

85
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:24,311
you know,

86
00:03:24,311 --> 00:03:25,140
whatever the fuck it is.

87
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:25,441
Yeah,

88
00:03:25,441 --> 00:03:25,651
man,

89
00:03:25,651 --> 00:03:28,680
we definitely like have
an awesome cenergy man.

90
00:03:28,681 --> 00:03:30,510
I just got to get a
fucking flotation tank.

91
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,460
I'm thinking about starting a Kickstarter

92
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:38,230
going down the field lab or go into,

93
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,380
how far are you away from Burbank?

94
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,130
I could do that,

95
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:44,710
but I've got this garage
that she's dying for a flood.

96
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,090
Listen,

97
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,850
any time you have some
time off during the day,

98
00:03:47,851 --> 00:03:49,020
you're more than welcome to come here.

99
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:49,700
And he's cool.

100
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:50,533
Anytime,

101
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,300
you know,

102
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,133
just come on over,

103
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:53,130
come on over and use it.

104
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,330
How often do you use it?

105
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:55,040
All the time.

106
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,830
Every day.

107
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:56,610
No,

108
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:56,791
no.

109
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:57,960
I believe in taking days off.

110
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:58,440
Um,

111
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,470
I think you can get too
addicted to the experience.

112
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,800
So it's a freaky experience.

113
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:02,850
And I know I'm not,

114
00:04:02,851 --> 00:04:03,930
I don't want to say too addicted,

115
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:04,950
but I,

116
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:07,370
I like going in there,

117
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,540
absorbing something,

118
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:11,810
coming out and then sort of
applying that to my life.

119
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,510
And one of the things that I
think about psychedelic trips,

120
00:04:14,511 --> 00:04:15,530
about meditation,

121
00:04:15,531 --> 00:04:17,480
about times at a tank,

122
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:22,280
which I think I find to be different
than meditation and different from

123
00:04:22,281 --> 00:04:24,740
psychedelic trips and sort
of a combination of the two,

124
00:04:24,741 --> 00:04:26,390
especially when I go in there and eat pot,

125
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,580
which is how I usually do it.

126
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,070
Yeah,

127
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,030
it's pretty intense,

128
00:04:29,031 --> 00:04:31,610
but it's not quite a
psychedelic experience,

129
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:35,490
the regular sentence
because of good part of the,

130
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:38,150
the visual stimuli and the
effects that I'm getting.

131
00:04:38,151 --> 00:04:41,180
It's because I'm floating
and fucking warm salt water,

132
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:41,670
you know?

133
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:44,690
And I feel like I'm flying through space
and I have no sensory input going in.

134
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:45,541
So it's,

135
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:47,710
it's a weird combination between
the two things we should,

136
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,340
meditation and psychedelic experience.

137
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:50,031
But,

138
00:04:50,031 --> 00:04:50,360
um,

139
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,630
I think in one of the most important
parts about any of that stuff,

140
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:57,920
when your experiment experimenting with
consciousness or pushing the boundaries

141
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:59,360
of thinking ideas,

142
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,770
you've got to be a little applied.

143
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,570
You can't be a cripple in this world.

144
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,291
A mental cripple.

145
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:03,830
You can't,

146
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:04,460
you can't,

147
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:04,881
you know,

148
00:05:04,881 --> 00:05:08,680
just only want to get high or just
only one to escape are all there and

149
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:09,440
meditate.

150
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:09,650
You know,

151
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:14,650
why would my instinct when I see like
monks is to Meijer their virtue and

152
00:05:14,691 --> 00:05:15,620
admired their,

153
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,820
their discipline,

154
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:17,990
but also some time to be,

155
00:05:17,991 --> 00:05:19,580
you're not getting any policy.

156
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,880
You're not having sex,

157
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,050
you're not having fun.

158
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:24,780
You don't listen to good music up there,

159
00:05:24,781 --> 00:05:25,080
you know,

160
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,430
party and you'll never
get a little too drunk.

161
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,800
You never really eat a
little too much food.

162
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:30,341
You know,

163
00:05:30,341 --> 00:05:31,580
you don't ever go to see a moat.

164
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:32,350
May Laugh,

165
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,640
laugh photo too loud.

166
00:05:33,641 --> 00:05:34,510
Come on man.

167
00:05:34,511 --> 00:05:35,140
What are you doing?

168
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:35,920
You're missing,

169
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,240
you're missing a big thing.

170
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:40,390
I understand that it's difficult
to manage this experience,

171
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:44,140
but don't tell me you got it right with
this minimalist approach because that's

172
00:05:44,141 --> 00:05:44,920
nonsense.

173
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,710
No one's got it.

174
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:45,891
Yeah,

175
00:05:45,891 --> 00:05:47,120
but maybe me and I'm not you.

176
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,320
Can I play devil's advocate?

177
00:05:48,321 --> 00:05:49,190
Can I play monkeys?

178
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:49,910
Advocate?

179
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:50,390
Yeah.

180
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:55,340
Maybe they look at us the same way cause
they plugged in to sometimes a million

181
00:05:55,341 --> 00:05:58,240
times better than music or blocking.

182
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,230
Maybe they've plugged
into something bigger.

183
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,153
You're right navy.

184
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,120
Maybe not though.

185
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,920
Maybe the most scared pusses wearing
orange robes and they don't get that.

186
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,300
They don't even have cars.

187
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:13,410
They never gotten a fucking Shelby gt
500 and heard that fucking engine grouth

188
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:14,510
that four inch pipe

189
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,980
hit that first gear and
fucking went sideways

190
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,800
is fun and all these things about them.

191
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:26,410
It was fun and all these things people
live invented great music and awesome

192
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:29,060
movies and and really
comfortable blankets.

193
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:31,250
They've invented all that shit
to make life more awesome.

194
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,470
Give blow blowjobs from
other monks may be,

195
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:35,280
do you really want that?

196
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:35,990
We don't know.

197
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:36,630
Do you want a monk?

198
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,840
Blowjobs brown

199
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,390
was enough.

200
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,230
Enough.

201
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,190
Thanks for everything.

202
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:46,770
See Son party rolls on.

203
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:50,090
Alright.

204
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:51,470
When I'm on the road I get jet lag.

205
00:06:51,471 --> 00:06:53,300
I take them the great for hangovers too.

206
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:54,440
I don't know why.

207
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,670
I don't understand the science behind it.

208
00:06:55,671 --> 00:06:56,860
Don't give it was raving about,

209
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,930
and I guess you gave him
some last time he did it.

210
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:02,070
People are gonna think that
this is some sort of a,

211
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,360
uh,

212
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,030
a big,

213
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:04,550
uh,

214
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,490
commercial push.

215
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:08,510
Like those some reason while we're talking
about this other than the fact that

216
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:09,790
it really works cause I,

217
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:14,810
the problem is I have a financial interest
of this company so people think that

218
00:07:15,261 --> 00:07:16,011
it's all,

219
00:07:16,011 --> 00:07:16,844
of course I'm just,

220
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,850
when you hired Tim Ferriss,

221
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:19,693
yeah.

222
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:20,430
Hired

223
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,260
at the author Tim Ferriss to come in,

224
00:07:22,261 --> 00:07:23,220
cause I showed it to him.

225
00:07:23,221 --> 00:07:23,461
I said,

226
00:07:23,461 --> 00:07:24,450
what do you think about the ingredients?

227
00:07:24,451 --> 00:07:25,830
This thing he said he
thought it was great.

228
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,990
So it was a perfect combination
and then he took it,

229
00:07:27,991 --> 00:07:29,610
he tried it and he liked it and people,

230
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,860
there's some idiots on my message board
that were accusing me of hiring him and

231
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:33,150
like,

232
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,290
even if you're just joking,

233
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,300
it's so annoying.

234
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,860
Like stop.

235
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,350
She says Brandon.

236
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:42,990
So pretty quickly you uh,

237
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:43,261
yeah.

238
00:07:43,261 --> 00:07:44,880
You feel pretty quick
with that couple of days.

239
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,410
1515.

240
00:07:46,411 --> 00:07:47,071
Oh this is here,

241
00:07:47,071 --> 00:07:47,904
man.

242
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,180
He felt it too.

243
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,440
Tim Ferriss,

244
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,340
he felt it right away.

245
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,710
I don't think I feel it right away.

246
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:53,031
You know,

247
00:07:53,031 --> 00:07:54,720
like he felt it within an hour or two.

248
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:59,250
I think it takes me a few hours at the
very least have to feel any effect of it.

249
00:07:59,620 --> 00:07:59,881
You know,

250
00:07:59,881 --> 00:08:01,040
I always want to be careful of like,

251
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,850
what is the placebo effect?

252
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,650
I'm not bullshitting myself.

253
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:05,161
Well,

254
00:08:05,161 --> 00:08:08,700
the main reason why I say I'm not bullshit
myself was because of the dreams that

255
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:10,430
I never had dreams like this before.

256
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,180
There's no way that that is bullshit.

257
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:14,400
That's because I didn't expect that.

258
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:15,510
So when it happened,

259
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:19,560
it was a very tangible result of something
new that's been introduced into my

260
00:08:19,561 --> 00:08:20,394
system.

261
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,560
And that's what's been
new Alpha brain shit.

262
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,450
And the other thing it does is it I've,

263
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,840
I know I don't sound like
a smooth talker right now,

264
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:28,771
but I'm tired.

265
00:08:28,771 --> 00:08:29,604
I've been working all day.

266
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:31,530
I do a scene.

267
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:34,110
It seems to me that my
words flow out better.

268
00:08:34,111 --> 00:08:35,580
I'm searching for words less.

269
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:37,080
I feel cleaner.

270
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,390
I felt like my mind works more crisply.

271
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:39,700
Yeah.

272
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,500
Do you agree with that?

273
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,640
Do you feel what you feel to,

274
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,200
what's that drug that writers use?

275
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:46,080
Adderall is like natural Adderall for me.

276
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,530
That's what Dunkin keeps saying.

277
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,940
Dunkin keep saying it's like a mile.

278
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:51,250
And I'm scared of it.

279
00:08:51,251 --> 00:08:52,240
That sounds awesome.

280
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:54,790
Out of Adderall scares the shit out
of me because I think I would love it.

281
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:55,351
You know,

282
00:08:55,351 --> 00:08:55,710
some,

283
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:56,281
some uh,

284
00:08:56,281 --> 00:08:57,810
productivity drug.

285
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:58,531
That's me,

286
00:08:58,531 --> 00:08:58,831
man.

287
00:08:58,831 --> 00:09:00,030
I fucking out.

288
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,220
And really,

289
00:09:01,221 --> 00:09:02,050
I mean,

290
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:02,710
uh,

291
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:04,830
amphetamine salts is what it is.

292
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,450
I have a friend that is David.

293
00:09:06,451 --> 00:09:09,750
A lot of girls hooked on speed and
the nightmare stories that he told me

294
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,940
elsewhere in your mid twenties,

295
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,990
they're all,

296
00:09:14,991 --> 00:09:17,780
they were all prescribed it
going through grade school.

297
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:18,561
Yeah.

298
00:09:18,561 --> 00:09:21,830
It's an ADHD drug or add whatever.

299
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,180
But basically like,

300
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,040
so Adderall is just ramp it down.

301
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:25,770
Yeah.

302
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:26,031
Yeah.

303
00:09:26,031 --> 00:09:26,890
There's no comics.

304
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:28,263
Yeah.

305
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:29,210
Andy kindler takes it.

306
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:29,870
Does he?

307
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:30,021
Yeah.

308
00:09:30,021 --> 00:09:31,160
He just started though.

309
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,180
And he said it's changed
his life immensely.

310
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,070
Like he went through the,

311
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,250
he,

312
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,350
he's not like a pill head.

313
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:35,570
Right.

314
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:37,650
He got prescribed the
changes life immensely.

315
00:09:37,651 --> 00:09:40,070
How he said that he had really bad add.

316
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:40,901
Well,

317
00:09:40,901 --> 00:09:44,230
I don't know if that's something
that I do it and I gave us hope,

318
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:44,811
hope,

319
00:09:44,811 --> 00:09:45,644
trips.

320
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:47,031
Like I do it.

321
00:09:47,031 --> 00:09:48,410
It makes me have my coke flashbacks.

322
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:49,520
Yeah.

323
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,780
I mean you can abuse it lasts.

324
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:51,890
A lot of people do that now.

325
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:53,460
They'll cut off the pills and snorting,

326
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,770
but like I get,

327
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,600
I have some 30 milligram pills.

328
00:09:56,601 --> 00:10:00,440
I take a quarter of it if like
I'm just completely wiped out.

329
00:10:00,441 --> 00:10:01,310
And what does it do for you?

330
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:02,360
Hey,

331
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,020
I'm here.

332
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:03,560
Wow.

333
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,010
Yeah.

334
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:05,690
What does the crash like when it's over?

335
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:06,570
No.

336
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:08,090
Do you ever worry about
heart attacks or anything?

337
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:08,631
Oh,

338
00:10:08,631 --> 00:10:10,310
constantly with everything.

339
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,183
The uh,

340
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:14,400
with the,

341
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:14,970
um,

342
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:15,803
no,

343
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:16,930
like,

344
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:17,390
you know,

345
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:18,410
I think about like,

346
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:20,180
I don't really think about him often,

347
00:10:20,181 --> 00:10:20,511
but like,

348
00:10:20,511 --> 00:10:20,631
yeah,

349
00:10:20,631 --> 00:10:22,280
it's smoking and drinking and,

350
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:22,870
right.

351
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:23,121
You know,

352
00:10:23,121 --> 00:10:23,411
getting,

353
00:10:23,411 --> 00:10:23,490
yeah,

354
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,390
closer to 40.

355
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:25,830
It's like 44,

356
00:10:25,831 --> 00:10:26,280
dude.

357
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:26,640
Yeah.

358
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,780
Well you exercise pretty,

359
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:28,531
I do,

360
00:10:28,531 --> 00:10:31,050
but it's like a lot of it
is fighting father time.

361
00:10:31,051 --> 00:10:31,211
I mean,

362
00:10:31,211 --> 00:10:33,630
I don't want to make sure that
it doesn't slide too far back.

363
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:37,660
Take vitamins all day and monitoring my
health and getting my blood work done

364
00:10:37,661 --> 00:10:41,400
and drinking this crazy green shit
they're going to get in and all that shit

365
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:45,420
that this green drink I drink every
morning a drink first thing in the day to

366
00:10:45,421 --> 00:10:45,661
Kevin.

367
00:10:45,661 --> 00:10:47,460
James taught me about it cause he uh,

368
00:10:47,461 --> 00:10:48,780
he lost incredible amount of weight.

369
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:49,830
He lost like 80 pounds,

370
00:10:49,831 --> 00:10:51,780
started looking great face slimmed up.

371
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:56,170
And what he did was he started drinking
this really healthy plant based smoothie

372
00:10:56,171 --> 00:10:57,300
at the beginning of every day.

373
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,700
So every day starts off of
this plant based smoothie.

374
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:00,534
And the idea is,

375
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,051
first of all,

376
00:11:01,051 --> 00:11:01,681
it's very rare.

377
00:11:01,681 --> 00:11:02,870
There's a lot of roughage.

378
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:07,830
It's fiber cleans out your system and
it's sort of lubes the way up for all the

379
00:11:07,831 --> 00:11:09,000
food that comes behind it.

380
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:12,420
So the idea is to start off your day with
one of these things and it's just sort

381
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:15,690
of like cleans the track and it
makes all of your food digest better,

382
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,610
chew your food much better,

383
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:17,971
you know,

384
00:11:17,971 --> 00:11:19,620
don't eat shit with a
lot of chemicals in it.

385
00:11:19,621 --> 00:11:21,750
And so he just didn't
altering his diet that way.

386
00:11:21,751 --> 00:11:24,120
Is potty just for it just fucking changed.

387
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:28,170
He was basically eating entirely plant
based diet for the first time in his

388
00:11:28,171 --> 00:11:28,740
life.

389
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:29,460
Just changes,

390
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,770
health changed everything
changed the way you know,

391
00:11:31,771 --> 00:11:32,700
the way he felt.

392
00:11:32,701 --> 00:11:36,240
He would get up in the morning and feel
fucking fantastic like all of his life.

393
00:11:36,241 --> 00:11:36,451
You know,

394
00:11:36,451 --> 00:11:38,130
he's been a big guy and you know,

395
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:38,791
he's getting older.

396
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:40,710
His joints were starting to
hurt and he said I would get up.

397
00:11:40,711 --> 00:11:41,910
I'd feel like a fucking old man.

398
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:42,451
He goes,

399
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:44,980
I started drinking this green
drink and drinking it everyday.

400
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,090
No,

401
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:47,270
no,

402
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:47,421
no.

403
00:11:47,421 --> 00:11:50,230
It's not prepackaged show you make it.

404
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,093
Yeah.

405
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:55,690
Well well this is my green
shake that I make everything.

406
00:11:55,990 --> 00:12:00,990
This is what I learned this from Kevin
James who lost like lost like 80 pounds.

407
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:06,040
What it is mostly is fresh Kale,

408
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,593
Kale,

409
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:09,821
cucumber,

410
00:12:09,821 --> 00:12:10,654
celery,

411
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,160
a little bit of um,

412
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:16,900
ginger and I throw a
pair on there as well.

413
00:12:16,901 --> 00:12:19,940
And we do everything about
mixing an apple on there.

414
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:49,280
I

415
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:52,480
take all this stuff

416
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,360
and I'll bring it over here.

417
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:56,471
And you know what?

418
00:12:56,471 --> 00:12:58,390
This is awesome for first and foremost,

419
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:00,123
your poop

420
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,510
poop just slides.

421
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,093
Do is

422
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:18,280
first thing I chop up,

423
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:33,670
is there a reason why you use
a blender instead of a juicer?

424
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:34,390
Yeah,

425
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:35,870
because the a,

426
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:38,980
the idea is that when
you're juicing things,

427
00:13:38,981 --> 00:13:41,950
you're not getting all of the
planning and not getting the fiber,

428
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:43,560
which is great for your body.

429
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:49,090
What this is is

430
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:55,090
having to break it all down and chew and
chew it and swallow and eat all these

431
00:13:55,091 --> 00:13:55,924
vegetables,

432
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:58,120
which should be boring
as fuck really to eat.

433
00:13:58,121 --> 00:13:59,650
I'm in this state except the payer.

434
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:00,670
You know,

435
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:01,503
it's kind of boring,

436
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:05,890
so what you do is you blend it
all up and drink it as a shape.

437
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:12,620
It's called the Vitamix and it's meant
for specifically for this how this works.

438
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:17,700
[inaudible]

439
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:40,070
should mix it all up with,

440
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:45,683
I'm 12

441
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:55,120
[inaudible]

442
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:04,100
comes out looking

443
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,780
at the whole case loads.

444
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,520
I'd probably do everything
except the ginger.

445
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:15,320
Ginger is good for any man.

446
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,210
How should that just

447
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:22,733
got me

448
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:29,690
super good for you and I've been doing
this every day for a few weeks now.

449
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:32,270
It's one of the nicest things
about not being on the road.

450
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,120
When I'm home,

451
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,160
I get to eat super clean and healthy.

452
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,700
So between this and uh,

453
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:46,530
all the vitamins I take vitamins

458
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:53,510
Alpha brain course.

459
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:54,590

Keep your balls off him.

472
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:35,420
Jack Three d take this
right before a workout.

473
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,440
It gets me jacked.

474
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,360
Nitric oxide

aminos amino clear from nutrition.

476
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:44,121
A company.

477
00:16:44,121 --> 00:16:45,200
I highly recommend.

478
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,550
Very strong products.

479
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,280
That's most of what I think day.

480
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:54,171
No,

481
00:16:54,171 --> 00:16:54,381
no,

482
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:55,130
fuck that.

483
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:56,100
I take pig paths.

484
00:16:56,280 --> 00:17:00,500
Eventually we're going to sell them at
the same company selling Alpha brain.

485
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:04,610
And we're going to do is we're
going to package all the highest,

486
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,050
most potent nutrients and put it in a
pack so that you don't have to do what I'm

487
00:17:09,051 --> 00:17:09,530
doing.

488
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:14,060
So you'd have to do this stacking all
your stuff and go into stores and buying

489
00:17:14,061 --> 00:17:14,894
things.

490
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:15,980
We're going to put together a thing.

491
00:17:15,981 --> 00:17:16,970
So just a little comment.

492
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:17,481
One a day,

493
00:17:17,481 --> 00:17:18,314
a little packet.

494
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:18,840
Oh,

495
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,130
I get it out.

496
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:21,340
Take it other,

497
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,850
you're probably not going
to take as much as I do.

498
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,490
I take 10 of these dead fish.

499
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:28,910
I took 10 days,

500
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:31,850
seven of these,

501
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,343
three of these.

502
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:43,370
And that's for real though.

503
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:48,110
I feel fantastic and my mind is super
clear and this is a lot of people that

504
00:17:48,111 --> 00:17:50,460
