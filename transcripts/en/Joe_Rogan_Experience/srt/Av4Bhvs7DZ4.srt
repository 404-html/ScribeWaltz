1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:02,910
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:04,080
Hey Rory.

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:04,680
What's up buddy?

4
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:05,370
Hey Joe,

5
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:06,300
how are you doing this man?

6
00:00:06,301 --> 00:00:06,841
I appreciate it.

7
00:00:06,841 --> 00:00:07,381
And seriously,

8
00:00:07,381 --> 00:00:08,520
I really appreciate you having me,

9
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:08,860
dude.

10
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:10,500
You have a fucking amazing story.

11
00:00:10,501 --> 00:00:11,820
You have a Hollywood success story.

12
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,290
It's very,

13
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:13,530
it's,

14
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:14,363
it's the,

15
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:16,890
it's pretty get the stone
right up to your face,

16
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:17,780
so if you could hear it.

17
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:18,151
Yeah,

18
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:19,030
that feels good.

19
00:00:19,031 --> 00:00:19,321
He'd be,

20
00:00:19,321 --> 00:00:20,154
that's what I'm saying.

21
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:21,930
Can I get another one on my other sheet?

22
00:00:21,931 --> 00:00:24,060
Fucking everywhere would
have put them all over you.

23
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:26,561
Sweet man.

24
00:00:26,561 --> 00:00:26,830
I'm too.

25
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:27,660
You up.

26
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:28,620
Turn that off for a second.

27
00:00:28,621 --> 00:00:29,454
I've got to do something.

28
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:31,321
No,

29
00:00:31,321 --> 00:00:31,501
I,

30
00:00:31,501 --> 00:00:31,880
it's,

31
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:32,521
it's very,

32
00:00:32,521 --> 00:00:32,730
uh,

33
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:36,330
on Hollywood in the sense that I was in
New York and working at the daily show,

34
00:00:36,331 --> 00:00:39,840
which is next to the horse
stables for central park.

35
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:40,051
Yeah,

36
00:00:40,051 --> 00:00:42,560
I should say W it's a great showbiz story.

37
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:43,111
I guess so,

38
00:00:43,111 --> 00:00:43,470
yeah.

39
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:48,470
It went from being like a PA to the
executive producer of the daily show and

40
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,770
that's fucking awesome.

41
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,070
Yeah,

42
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,150
well it was good.

43
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,060
It was not the,

44
00:00:52,061 --> 00:00:52,560
uh,

45
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,210
I didn't know that that
was going to happen.

46
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:54,980
I got a job,

47
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:56,040
wanted to do comedy.

48
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,080
I wanted to do standup,

49
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,080
but I went to college,

50
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,680
so I felt weird coming out of college and
tell my parents I was just going to be

51
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:02,490
competing it,

52
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:03,290
you know,

53
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:03,870
like yeah,

54
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:05,340
remember all that money and stuff.

55
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:08,670
Like I'm just going to tell
jokes like I come from like,

56
00:01:08,671 --> 00:01:09,270
uh,

57
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:10,980
my dad was like an old school Italian guy.

58
00:01:10,981 --> 00:01:12,690
Like he doesn't understand
this kind of stuff.

59
00:01:12,691 --> 00:01:12,991
He's like,

60
00:01:12,991 --> 00:01:13,410
what?

61
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:14,243
What about a job?

62
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:14,881
You know what I mean?

63
00:01:14,881 --> 00:01:15,661
Like get a job.

64
00:01:15,661 --> 00:01:18,430
Like he would have been happier
if I said I was going to be a,

65
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:20,430
like a mailman or an electrician,

66
00:01:20,431 --> 00:01:23,190
like that would have made
more sense than a job in TV.

67
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:24,630
So we're comedy in general,

68
00:01:24,631 --> 00:01:28,800
so I got the job through were and like
that could at least justify the love of

69
00:01:28,801 --> 00:01:29,440
comedy.

70
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,690
That's sort of makes sense.

71
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:30,961
Like,

72
00:01:30,961 --> 00:01:31,231
look,

73
00:01:31,231 --> 00:01:33,120
I'm working in the serious business.

74
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:33,981
Yeah.

75
00:01:33,981 --> 00:01:36,120
Leave television shows
were very successful,

76
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,040
or at least I had to go somewhere.

77
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:38,903
Do you know what?

78
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,650
I think that was a big part of it.

79
00:01:40,651 --> 00:01:41,071
It was like,

80
00:01:41,071 --> 00:01:41,511
well,

81
00:01:41,511 --> 00:01:43,220
what do you do when the
morning when the alarm was on?

82
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:43,351
Oh,

83
00:01:43,351 --> 00:01:46,270
you don't have to get up in the morning
cause you just work at night and comedy

84
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:47,123
clubs like what?

85
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,113
Yeah,

86
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,370
the comics that we know that
don't do anything during the,

87
00:01:50,371 --> 00:01:51,120
during the doll.

88
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,320
Yeah.

89
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,970
I mean they'd just fuck off
completely and totally get on stage,

90
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,000
which I'm always quite
jealous of actually.

91
00:01:57,001 --> 00:01:57,300
You know,

92
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:57,570
I,

93
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,340
but I always had that
feeling when people go,

94
00:01:59,341 --> 00:02:00,150
how do you do both?

95
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:00,391
I'm like,

96
00:02:00,391 --> 00:02:01,650
well you know,

97
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,700
once during the day,

98
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:03,271
you know.

99
00:02:03,271 --> 00:02:05,460
So that's one way to do both though.

100
00:02:05,461 --> 00:02:06,121
As I got older,

101
00:02:06,121 --> 00:02:09,900
I got more tired at night and it's harder
to go out and do clubs after the daily

102
00:02:09,901 --> 00:02:10,200
show.

103
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:10,561
It is.

104
00:02:10,561 --> 00:02:10,861
Right.

105
00:02:10,861 --> 00:02:12,000
It's the hardest thing
in the world when you,

106
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:12,930
when you're on a set,

107
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,040
not the hardest thing in the world.

108
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:17,580
I shouldn't look compared
to anything else.

109
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:18,690
It's really easy.

110
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:19,950
It's as easy as fuck.

111
00:02:19,951 --> 00:02:20,341
But I mean,

112
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:21,390
it's hard to work.

113
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:22,051
What I was going to say,

114
00:02:22,051 --> 00:02:25,830
it's the hardest thing in the world to
work a full time job and then try to go

115
00:02:25,831 --> 00:02:27,620
out and pursue something
because you're all your,

116
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,890
your juice has gone.

117
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:30,390
If you're,

118
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:30,601
I mean,

119
00:02:30,601 --> 00:02:33,690
anything you're trying to do that's
like athletes that have full time jobs,

120
00:02:33,691 --> 00:02:34,920
like fighters at a fulltime jobs.

121
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:35,491
Fuck,

122
00:02:35,491 --> 00:02:36,001
that's hard.

123
00:02:36,001 --> 00:02:38,880
And that's even harder because they have
hours of training they have to put in

124
00:02:38,881 --> 00:02:39,600
every day.

125
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,760
But just when you're done
at the end of the day,

126
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:42,331
you're done.

127
00:02:42,331 --> 00:02:43,500
You want to get a bite to eat,

128
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:44,570
watch TV.

129
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:48,470
You don't want to except for your
notes and fucking yet or the,

130
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:48,961
for me,

131
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:52,100
the other thing was too is still not
even at a place where like I walk in with

132
00:02:52,101 --> 00:02:52,831
club and they're let go,

133
00:02:52,831 --> 00:02:53,730
just get right up.

134
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:54,780
It's,

135
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:55,350
you know,

136
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:56,011
usually they're like,

137
00:02:56,011 --> 00:02:58,490
why don't you clean up this
mess at 1:30 AM you know?

138
00:02:58,930 --> 00:02:59,740
Um,

139
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,573
but I,

140
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,840
so for me it was a lot of,

141
00:03:01,841 --> 00:03:03,760
it was just I loved doing the time,

142
00:03:03,761 --> 00:03:06,190
but sometimes you've got to
hang out at the club and then,

143
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:06,491
you know,

144
00:03:06,491 --> 00:03:06,820
it's like,

145
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:07,270
yeah,

146
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,150
my bigger problem was because then I have
fun hanging out with other comics and

147
00:03:10,151 --> 00:03:10,871
I have afterwards,

148
00:03:10,871 --> 00:03:13,510
I have a couple of drinks and cause I
know like the harder problem was getting

149
00:03:13,511 --> 00:03:15,820
up the next morning and be three hours.

150
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:16,150
Right.

151
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,980
So that's where I started to have that.

152
00:03:17,981 --> 00:03:18,730
Uh,

153
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:19,030
you know,

154
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:19,361
well,

155
00:03:19,361 --> 00:03:19,990
I'm doing,

156
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:22,660
the thing that was good about my day
job is it got me better at comedy,

157
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:26,890
so I didn't really lose the
like sort of experience.

158
00:03:26,891 --> 00:03:31,660
I think I would've gotten on stage what
I didn't get by doing it every night for

159
00:03:31,661 --> 00:03:32,620
a while was a,

160
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,150
you know,

161
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,220
like seasoned on stage.

162
00:03:36,221 --> 00:03:39,550
It took me a little longer to get like
comfortable on stage to get back into the

163
00:03:39,551 --> 00:03:39,940
groove.

164
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:40,180
Yeah,

165
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:40,620
exactly.

166
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,200
Yeah.

167
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,033
But uh,

168
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:42,441
still,

169
00:03:42,441 --> 00:03:42,580
uh,

170
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,450
it was a good experience.

171
00:03:43,451 --> 00:03:44,650
Pa was fun.

172
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:45,670
That's amazing.

173
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:48,850
That's one of those stories that you're
going to ruin the expectations for every

174
00:03:48,851 --> 00:03:49,450
fucking kid who,

175
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:54,450
everybody there obviously I have to say
at the daily show because it's been on

176
00:03:55,091 --> 00:03:58,270
so long at John's such a cool guy and
like really gave people opportunities

177
00:03:58,271 --> 00:03:58,870
there.

178
00:03:58,870 --> 00:03:59,560
Um,

179
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:03,070
I was among the first people
to kind of make that journey,

180
00:04:03,071 --> 00:04:04,810
but now have not been the only one.

181
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,120
That writer there was a PA that's amazing.

182
00:04:08,121 --> 00:04:08,840
A bunch of the EPA,

183
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,830
the eps and peas and stuff where Peter's,

184
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:10,961
yeah,

185
00:04:10,961 --> 00:04:12,500
like people can,

186
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:13,690
you know,

187
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:16,360
that's like a farm system almost
for good writing and producing.

188
00:04:16,361 --> 00:04:17,080
It's pretty cool.

189
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,100
That's fantastic.

190
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,940
And it's become like for a lot
of people how they get the news.

191
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:22,571
Yeah.

192
00:04:22,571 --> 00:04:23,404
That's a problem.

193
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:25,840
Isn't that weird?

194
00:04:25,841 --> 00:04:26,350
Like that?

195
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,690
That's how people get
the new John Stewart.

196
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,081
Yeah.

197
00:04:29,081 --> 00:04:30,160
People tell me that a lot.

198
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:30,581
They say,

199
00:04:30,581 --> 00:04:30,681
well,

200
00:04:30,681 --> 00:04:32,260
I guess where I get my news and I get it.

201
00:04:32,261 --> 00:04:34,300
Like I remember being in
college would go to college,

202
00:04:34,301 --> 00:04:35,134
kids get their news.

203
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:37,540
I felt like I didn't even watch
the news when I was in college.

204
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:37,691
Like,

205
00:04:37,691 --> 00:04:38,111
I don't know,

206
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:38,890
you're in college,

207
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:39,490
you know,

208
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:41,260
so I guess it's better than nothing.

209
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:41,561
But,

210
00:04:41,561 --> 00:04:42,040
uh,

211
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,580
I always tell people it's a good place
to start to get interested in a topic and

212
00:04:45,581 --> 00:04:48,430
then go off and do your own
research or whatever you want.

213
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:53,230
Because when people get into political
debates off of like emails and like daily

214
00:04:53,231 --> 00:04:54,670
show clips and they were like,

215
00:04:54,671 --> 00:04:55,690
that's actually not true.

216
00:04:55,691 --> 00:04:55,961
It's like,

217
00:04:55,961 --> 00:04:56,261
you know,

218
00:04:56,261 --> 00:04:59,350
they don't have like a real
understanding of each story necessarily,

219
00:04:59,351 --> 00:05:00,070
you know?

220
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:00,820
Yeah.

221
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:01,631
It's weird thing,

222
00:05:01,631 --> 00:05:01,991
isn't it?

223
00:05:01,991 --> 00:05:02,470
When you're,

224
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:02,951
when you're,

225
00:05:02,951 --> 00:05:07,951
when you're doing a television show that's
also an educational show and also has

226
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,720
like a very progressive
point of view are very,

227
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:14,710
what you would think of when you think
of John Stewart is like very intelligent,

228
00:05:14,711 --> 00:05:15,544
very progressive,

229
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:18,670
mocking of both the left and the
right when they do ridiculous shit.

230
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:19,360
Yeah.

231
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,000
But it's gotta be funny for sure.

232
00:05:21,001 --> 00:05:23,440
I mean that's a hard job.

233
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:23,711
Yeah.

234
00:05:23,711 --> 00:05:25,300
Well it's really hard for him.

235
00:05:25,301 --> 00:05:28,330
For me it was a lot easier
cause I got to watch him do it.

236
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,110
Right.

237
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:29,351
I mean,

238
00:05:29,351 --> 00:05:31,810
that's the thing about John
that's amazing is he does all,

239
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:36,580
he's involved from 9:00 AM through the
end of the show obviously when he hosts

240
00:05:36,581 --> 00:05:36,700
it.

241
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,533
But in other words,

242
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:41,860
she so intimately involved and he's so
smart and so sharp that like when he's in

243
00:05:41,861 --> 00:05:42,694
the chair,

244
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:47,560
I never worried about a joke not working
because even when they didn't work,

245
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,520
he just would like call an audible and
his own head and then like remember a

246
00:05:51,521 --> 00:05:54,640
joke from like the 90 and meeting that
he liked that didn't make the script and

247
00:05:54,641 --> 00:05:58,100
throw that in or it's pretty amazing
to watch him to sitting in the studio

248
00:05:58,101 --> 00:06:03,101
because he'll change a joke in prompter
as a prompter scrolling and then later

249
00:06:03,501 --> 00:06:04,890
there's a call back to the joke.

250
00:06:04,891 --> 00:06:08,980
He changed and he remembers the change
the callback or skip the call back.

251
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:09,820
And I'm like,

252
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,050
and I'm sitting there with the
script watching the prompter going,

253
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:13,010
oh no.

254
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:13,400
I'm like,

255
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:13,761
oh no,

256
00:06:13,761 --> 00:06:14,940
here comes the callback.

257
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,010
Like we're screwed,

258
00:06:16,011 --> 00:06:16,640
you know,

259
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,230
and then he's just jumps it or,

260
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:18,500
or,

261
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,020
or tags it with the jokey.

262
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:20,930
It's amazing.

263
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:21,141
Yeah.

264
00:06:21,141 --> 00:06:22,280
It's really like watching

265
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,730
for that long too.

266
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:26,181
I mean,

267
00:06:26,181 --> 00:06:28,100
he's fucking smooth.

268
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,140
He's so used to that Gig.

269
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:34,290
Like for Jimmy Fallon or me for Seth
Meyers who tried the same sort of an

270
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,810
impromptu ad Lib.

271
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,070
They might pull it off,

272
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,860
but Jon Stewart has been doing it forever.

273
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,100
Yeah.

274
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,180
Forever and ever.

275
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:41,391
Oh,

276
00:06:41,391 --> 00:06:41,840
no doubt.

277
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,680
And he also,

278
00:06:42,681 --> 00:06:43,514
uh,

279
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:43,700
yeah,

280
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,150
he just,

281
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:46,640
and he also just knows a lot.

282
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,750
What does a good comic too.

283
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:49,040
Yeah.

284
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,791
He's a great comic,

285
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:51,520
but he also just knows,

286
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,800
he understands comedy in a way that,

287
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:55,611
um,

288
00:06:55,611 --> 00:06:56,280
I'm sure those,

289
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:56,411
I,

290
00:06:56,411 --> 00:06:56,690
you know,

291
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,580
I know both Seth and Jimmy,

292
00:06:58,820 --> 00:06:59,570
Super Funny Guy,

293
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:01,100
I just never worked with
them in that capacity.

294
00:07:01,101 --> 00:07:03,350
So I know John understands it,

295
00:07:03,351 --> 00:07:04,190
like music,

296
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,053
you know what I'm saying?

297
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:05,481
Oh No,

298
00:07:05,481 --> 00:07:06,111
that won't work.

299
00:07:06,111 --> 00:07:06,944
This will work.

300
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:07,490
You know,

301
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:08,000
and people go,

302
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,860
how do you know something's
going to work before you try it?

303
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:10,670
And it's like,

304
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:11,710
you just kind of know.

305
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,201
I don't know.

306
00:07:12,201 --> 00:07:13,040
You just kind of know.

307
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:13,191
Well,

308
00:07:13,191 --> 00:07:15,170
he also has a very specific voice.

309
00:07:15,171 --> 00:07:18,140
He knows his voice and
his style of delivery.

310
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,033
Absolutely.

311
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:19,431
It's,

312
00:07:19,431 --> 00:07:19,850
um,

313
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:20,151
it's,

314
00:07:20,151 --> 00:07:20,600
it's an,

315
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,410
it's a fascinating show
because it's very political,

316
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,670
but yet very funny.

317
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:26,590
It's,

318
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:30,110
he doesn't sacrifice like going for funny.

319
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:30,590
Yeah.

320
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:35,090
Like to try to look like less
silly or try to look dignified.

321
00:07:35,091 --> 00:07:36,740
He's not trying to monologue it.

322
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:37,011
Yeah.

323
00:07:37,011 --> 00:07:37,131
No,

324
00:07:37,131 --> 00:07:38,690
he's just making this stuff.

325
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:42,020
It's funny as you can and sometimes he
gets extremely animated and it's fucking

326
00:07:42,021 --> 00:07:42,541
hilarious.

327
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:43,350
Yeah.

328
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:43,610
That,

329
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:44,210
I mean he's,

330
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:45,043
he's,

331
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:46,520
he's versatile in that sense.

332
00:07:46,521 --> 00:07:48,380
Like he can really do and he tied comedy.

333
00:07:48,381 --> 00:07:48,710
Yeah.

334
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:49,543
And uh,

335
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:50,330
but yeah,

336
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:51,163
as far as it,

337
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:51,891
I think it's,

338
00:07:51,891 --> 00:07:52,940
cause it really is,

339
00:07:52,941 --> 00:07:53,360
and people,

340
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,160
there's always bothers people
so much that was wanting to go,

341
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:55,341
oh,

342
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:57,770
what they think the daily
show us that can agenda.

343
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:58,041
I was like,

344
00:07:58,041 --> 00:07:59,420
we're all sitting around
in a circle be like,

345
00:07:59,421 --> 00:08:00,780
how do we screw the right?

346
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,060
It's like,

347
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:02,511
no,

348
00:08:02,511 --> 00:08:03,170
it doesn't.

349
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:03,950
It's,

350
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:04,880
people don't believe that.

351
00:08:04,881 --> 00:08:05,090
And they go,

352
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:05,241
Oh,

353
00:08:05,241 --> 00:08:07,150
you're just hiding behind the
fact that it's a comedy show.

354
00:08:07,151 --> 00:08:07,341
He'd go,

355
00:08:07,341 --> 00:08:07,760
no.

356
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,380
Doing comedy is really hard.

357
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:10,090
There's nothing to hide.

358
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,960
Like we still have to take the stories.

359
00:08:11,961 --> 00:08:13,220
We still tried to get everything right.

360
00:08:13,221 --> 00:08:15,410
We have people who fact check.

361
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:19,040
There's a guy there named Adam
maciato coffee was like just a guru of

362
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:23,540
information and we'll come in
to the rewrite room between
rehearsal and the show

363
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:24,800
after we change a joke and I go,

364
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,300
you can't say this this way cause
it's statistically inaccurate to like

365
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:30,380
sometimes I'm like,

366
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:30,861
yeah man,

367
00:08:30,861 --> 00:08:31,694
no one's going to care.

368
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:32,930
I can't say that,

369
00:08:32,931 --> 00:08:34,250
but I'm saying it's not even,

370
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:35,690
it was a we're,

371
00:08:35,691 --> 00:08:36,530
we're so we're,

372
00:08:36,531 --> 00:08:39,150
we really fact check stuff
that goes out but the,

373
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:39,620
you know,

374
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,490
so it really,

375
00:08:40,491 --> 00:08:43,250
a big part of the day is figuring
out how to tell the story,

376
00:08:43,251 --> 00:08:46,070
the narrative and then adding
the jokes is why you have,

377
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:46,460
you know,

378
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,540
writers and guys like John,

379
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:48,374
you know,

380
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,520
then you can pile on the funny,

381
00:08:49,521 --> 00:08:51,230
but funny is the most important thing.

382
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,070
There really is.

383
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:53,150
That's what's so fun.

384
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:55,140
That's why I stayed so long
because it's not like a,

385
00:08:55,141 --> 00:08:55,920
uh,

386
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,320
I don't know.

387
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:56,520
It's,

388
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,230
there's no like movement happening.

389
00:08:58,231 --> 00:08:59,280
There was just a comedy show.

390
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:02,140
Well that's why everybody
who gets so attached to it,

391
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:02,881
it's so crazy.

392
00:09:02,881 --> 00:09:07,881
It's like they want it almost to be
more ideologically driven than it is.

393
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:08,790
You know?

394
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:09,570
It's like people would,

395
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:11,730
they would want it if he
said something ridiculous,

396
00:09:11,731 --> 00:09:13,620
supportive and supportive of Obama,

397
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:14,520
they would like it.

398
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:14,760
Sure.

399
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,900
But if Obama fucks up,

400
00:09:15,901 --> 00:09:17,430
he goes after him too all the time.

401
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:17,820
Yeah.

402
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:18,690
I mean that's the thing.

403
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:19,380
Yeah.

404
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:24,060
The show really became what it is or
what people think of it as now during the

405
00:09:24,061 --> 00:09:25,020
Bush administration.

406
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:30,140
So I think people really associated with
being this like hardcore left wing a

407
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:33,180
show and it definitely slants laughed.

408
00:09:33,181 --> 00:09:38,181
I mean it's hard sometimes for it not
to within in comedy because everything

409
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:43,770
that's when you're pointing out some
things are just straight up absurd.

410
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:44,460
Yeah.

411
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:47,790
It's hard sometimes not to seem left
cause you're throwing away like,

412
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:48,211
right.

413
00:09:48,211 --> 00:09:48,840
You know?

414
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,240
So I think that's what people go.

415
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,950
Why don't people do a
right wing daily show?

416
00:09:52,951 --> 00:09:53,430
It's like,

417
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:54,900
it's not really a left or a right thing.

418
00:09:54,901 --> 00:09:58,290
It's just a lot of times comedy is
dismissive of people taking themselves too

419
00:09:58,291 --> 00:09:58,891
seriously.

420
00:09:58,891 --> 00:10:03,180
And Conservatives have a tendency
to take things very seriously.

421
00:10:03,181 --> 00:10:03,811
You know what I'm saying?

422
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:05,430
That's exactly what they are.

423
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:06,870
They're conservative,

424
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,700
exacting,

425
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,331
more centered.

426
00:10:08,331 --> 00:10:11,820
Comic by nature is the guy sitting in
the back of the classroom being like,

427
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,781
look at his dick.

428
00:10:12,781 --> 00:10:13,160
You know,

429
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,880
it's like you don't really care.

430
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,020
You know what the person's saying,

431
00:10:16,021 --> 00:10:18,210
you're just finding places to get a laugh.

432
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,710
And I think so for us,

433
00:10:19,711 --> 00:10:20,940
like when the left does sort of things,

434
00:10:20,941 --> 00:10:22,350
which is also quite frequent,

435
00:10:22,351 --> 00:10:23,910
like occupy Wall Street.

436
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:24,560
Yeah.

437
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,390
Was a perfect example of my
favorite times at the daily show.

438
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,340
Well were like ripping the left
and new asshole and the audience,

439
00:10:30,341 --> 00:10:31,290
cause I'm in the studio,

440
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:32,124
we're used to be.

441
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,270
And the audience is like,

442
00:10:33,271 --> 00:10:37,010
what are you guys doing man John,

443
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,340
this is our movement man.

444
00:10:38,341 --> 00:10:38,671
And he's,

445
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:40,170
and they'll let you
know I don't like they,

446
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:41,700
if they zip up their zip,

447
00:10:41,701 --> 00:10:42,091
he's over there.

448
00:10:42,091 --> 00:10:43,740
John Stewart for president t shirts.

449
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:44,410
Gosh,

450
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:44,880
Shit.

451
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,500
And for me it was like we crush those
dudes and then I'd go to the desk between

452
00:10:49,501 --> 00:10:50,370
commercials and we'd be like,

453
00:10:50,371 --> 00:10:51,070
yeah,

454
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:51,903
you know,

455
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:52,680
you know,

456
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,050
it's a standups mentality.

457
00:10:54,051 --> 00:10:55,130
Like do you feel the crowd?

458
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:55,321
Like,

459
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,520
I just came back from Madison,

460
00:10:56,521 --> 00:10:57,510
Wisconsin this weekend.

461
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,190
And it's an amazing city.

462
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:00,590
Like the,

463
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:02,370
the club is awesome.

464
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:03,540
The shows were so fun,

465
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:04,950
but they were,

466
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:05,730
it was grown.

467
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:05,850
They,

468
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:08,400
there were groans from the crowd
on certain things I would say,

469
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:09,960
cause it was this college town,

470
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:10,240
right?

471
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,690
And colleges now are really at like,

472
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,050
I know that's like a,

473
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,140
a taboo right wing thing to say,

474
00:11:16,141 --> 00:11:21,141
but there's a left wing
political correctness in
college now that is an extreme

475
00:11:21,721 --> 00:11:22,410
extreme.

476
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:25,680
And I remember like 10 years ago doing a
college gig is very different than now.

477
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:26,960
You make a joke about being like,

478
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,150
whoa.

479
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,660
And that was happening
in Madison and there's,

480
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:31,501
you know,

481
00:11:31,501 --> 00:11:32,071
as a comic,

482
00:11:32,071 --> 00:11:32,281
right?

483
00:11:32,281 --> 00:11:34,170
Like you feel that from
the crowd and you go,

484
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:34,531
wait,

485
00:11:34,531 --> 00:11:35,340
what just happened?

486
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:35,790
Yeah.

487
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:36,240
And then you,

488
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:36,510
you know,

489
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:37,890
you want to like poke it a little bit.

490
00:11:37,891 --> 00:11:39,030
So on the daily show,

491
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:39,990
John's a comic,

492
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:40,820
but we hit it,

493
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:40,930
well,

494
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:42,060
we hit a note on something.

495
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:44,310
We were going after Hillary
in Oh eight same thing.

496
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:44,671
Go.

497
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:45,810
What do you guys do it?

498
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,163
I don't know.

499
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,950
Doing what we do and making fun
of people who were in charge,

500
00:11:49,951 --> 00:11:50,700
like,

501
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,160
you know,

502
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:51,620
it's sorry.

503
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,140
You don't,

504
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,550
