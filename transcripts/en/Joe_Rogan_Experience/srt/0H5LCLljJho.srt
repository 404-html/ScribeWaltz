1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:05,190
Rogan experience Joe Rogan podcast.
And we're live gentlemen,

2
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:10,420
here we go again.
What's happening back in the room?

3
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:12,460
A pleasure to see you guys.
As always.

4
00:00:12,461 --> 00:00:14,740
This is one of my favorite podcasts that
we ever do.

5
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:16,173
And uh,
this is very timely because first of 

6
00:00:19,601 --> 00:00:22,180
all,
the Big New York Times article about the

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,270
possibility of a,
a comet hitting Los Angeles.

8
00:00:25,271 --> 00:00:29,650
The preparations for what they would do 
if a common hit Los Angeles.

9
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:31,210
And uh,
the comment,

10
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,320
no one has Donald Trump that's hit the 
United States and he's even got the hair

11
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,640
and just the whole thing is,
I mean,

12
00:00:39,641 --> 00:00:41,440
if the end of the world was coming,
boy,

13
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:43,000
it's all on the wall.
You know,

14
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:44,770
the writing's all there.
It's kind of crazy.

15
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,200
So what's the latest and the greatest?

16
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:48,643
Well,
the latest and the latest and the 

17
00:00:49,281 --> 00:00:50,114
greatest is like,
I mean last year when we sat down with 

18
00:00:51,711 --> 00:00:53,450
you,
I think it was last November.

19
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,153
Yeah,
it was almost a year got floated in the 

20
00:00:56,091 --> 00:00:56,924
discussion.
The idea that this really important 

21
00:00:58,341 --> 00:01:02,480
comet research that's going on,
which is just changing our whole view of

22
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:05,810
history and prehistory and of the future
of humanity,

23
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,730
that it would be good to make a film 
about this.

24
00:01:07,731 --> 00:01:08,564
And crowdfunded.
I actually mentioned that to the 

25
00:01:09,741 --> 00:01:14,000
scientists and they said what we really 
need is more funding for our research.

26
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:17,660
And so they've inspired by basically by 
your shell,

27
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:20,690
they have put out a crowdfunding 
campaign,

28
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:23,210
um,
which is linked on my,

29
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,640
on my website,
it's the comic research group.

30
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:26,780
Um,
uh,

31
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:28,400
it's,
it's a big story right now.

32
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,680
So how can people find it really 
quickly?

33
00:01:30,681 --> 00:01:34,100
It's indeigogo well researched much 
quicker way.

34
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,990
Just go,
just go to my website,

35
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,930
Graham hancock.com
and there's a revolving banner,

36
00:01:38,931 --> 00:01:41,900
which is the comic research group.
Click on that and you're in business.

37
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:42,730
Beautiful.
Okay.

38
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:43,563
Graham hancock.com
and then crowdfunding for common 

39
00:01:47,351 --> 00:01:48,184
research.
And so what are they you are trying to 

40
00:01:49,421 --> 00:01:50,254
put together?

41
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:51,383
Well,
they're,

42
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:52,880
they're wanting to,
he said,

43
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:55,770
the thing is these guys have actually 
not had any official funding.

44
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,633
This is a group of major,
highly credentialed scientists who for 

45
00:01:58,711 --> 00:01:59,544
the last decade have been investigating 
the extraordinary story of a massive 

46
00:02:04,171 --> 00:02:08,190
comic series of comic impacts on the 
North American ice cap 12,800

47
00:02:08,191 --> 00:02:10,080
years ago.
That is the,

48
00:02:10,081 --> 00:02:14,260
the global cataclysm that wipes out a 
whole civilization from,

49
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,280
from prehistory.
So that's why it's of interest to me.

50
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:20,100
Um,
they're not coming at it from that point

51
00:02:20,101 --> 00:02:20,934
of view.
They're coming at it from rediscovering 

52
00:02:22,411 --> 00:02:24,350
something that we've lost about 
ourselves.

53
00:02:24,351 --> 00:02:28,020
Something is really important to 
understand the role of cataclysms in the

54
00:02:28,021 --> 00:02:31,020
story of the earth and they need to do 
much more research.

55
00:02:31,021 --> 00:02:33,410
So they need to go back to greenland 
and,

56
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,610
and look for the nano diamonds in the,
in,

57
00:02:35,611 --> 00:02:37,830
in the greenland ice cores they need,
there's a,

58
00:02:37,831 --> 00:02:38,664
there's an ancient city,
which they're not revealing the name of 

59
00:02:40,801 --> 00:02:41,634
which they're pretty certain was wiped 
out by a comet impact about four and a 

60
00:02:44,191 --> 00:02:45,024
half thousand years ago.
They want to go there and investigate 

61
00:02:47,311 --> 00:02:48,870
that.
So there's a lot of field work they need

62
00:02:48,871 --> 00:02:49,704
to do to drive home this hypothesis and 
to frankly put down the opposition 

63
00:02:54,421 --> 00:02:55,254
because there's been so much opposition 
to this idea from people with vested 

64
00:02:57,931 --> 00:03:00,040
interest in other theories that a,

65
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,660
and that's why these guys have not got 
funding,

66
00:03:01,661 --> 00:03:02,494
so the only place they're going to get 
funding to do this further research is 

67
00:03:05,201 --> 00:03:06,034
from members of the general public and 
that's what we're hoping that will will 

68
00:03:08,681 --> 00:03:11,230
happen.
It's called the comet research group.

69
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,710
There's a banner on my site and all the 
links are there to their crowd funding,

70
00:03:14,711 --> 00:03:15,544
to their website,
which is full of masses of scientific 

71
00:03:17,171 --> 00:03:19,750
information and to their facebook page 
as well.

72
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:20,943
It is a very unusual thing,
the the fact that we know that comments 

73
00:03:26,261 --> 00:03:29,710
and all sorts of various large objects 
have impacted the earth.

74
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,230
We see the craters,
we know they exist,

75
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,870
but it's so rarely discussed.
It's so,

76
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:37,480
it's so strange.
If it wasn't for this article in the New

77
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,130
York Times,
I can't remember when the last time,

78
00:03:39,131 --> 00:03:42,010
and that even came up and it's such a 
huge issue.

79
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:43,900
It's a massive issue.
It's a massive issue,

80
00:03:43,901 --> 00:03:45,480
both randall and I have really,
you know,

81
00:03:45,481 --> 00:03:47,590
give it a great deal of thought to this.
And I think Randall,

82
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:52,660
the point is that catastrophes are the 
untold story of our past.

83
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:56,980
We were given a little,
we were given a little hint of it.

84
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,290
Um,
February of 2013.

85
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:02,140
Chelyabinsk Siberia.
Remember the event?

86
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:02,990
Yeah,
yeah.

87
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:03,823
No,
that was just a little cosmic Spec came 

88
00:04:05,651 --> 00:04:07,870
in.
I was about 50 feet in diameter,

89
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:08,940
which is about,
um,

90
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:13,770
and it came in at a fairly low angle of 
blew up nearly 18.

91
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,670
Get that thing right in front of you.
Right in front of me.

92
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,390
Like this.
Yeah.

93
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:19,660
If you have flat it out,
it's usually easier when there's better.

94
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:20,830
Yeah.
There we go.

95
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,300
So it,
it came in,

96
00:04:22,301 --> 00:04:23,134
I think it exploded 12 miles,
about 20 kilometers up in the 

97
00:04:26,381 --> 00:04:27,214
atmosphere,
but it was still enough to damage 

98
00:04:28,451 --> 00:04:31,900
thousands of buildings and injure 1500 
people.

99
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,733
Now,
the thing about that one is if it had 

100
00:04:33,611 --> 00:04:34,444
been slightly larger,
if it had come in at a slightly steeper 

101
00:04:37,001 --> 00:04:39,250
angle,
a little bit higher velocity,

102
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,710
you could have had thousands of 
fatalities.

103
00:04:41,711 --> 00:04:42,544
Rather than just injuries.
And that would have been major headline 

104
00:04:44,981 --> 00:04:48,580
news at that point as it was.
It's already forgotten.

105
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:50,970
But you do remember.
Yes.

106
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:53,290
Oversight.
We may even talk have talked.

107
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:54,340
I believe we did.
We did.

108
00:04:54,341 --> 00:04:55,960
Yeah.
We showed videos of it.

109
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,430
Yeah.
What's fascinating is a,

110
00:04:57,431 --> 00:05:01,180
Russia has so many of those trail camp 
on not trail cam mom,

111
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,280
uh,
Dash Cam photo cameras.

112
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,263
That's right.
Cause they have so much insurance fraud 

113
00:05:05,621 --> 00:05:08,500
apparently over there and people slam 
into each other all the time and we want

114
00:05:08,501 --> 00:05:09,334
to record it.
So we were fortunate enough to have so 

115
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:14,920
many of those videos because of that,
which puts it on the record.

116
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,570
Whereas other,
otherwise it would,

117
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:17,690
it would not be,
I think,

118
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:20,980
I think people don't,
it doesn't like to talk about cataclysms

119
00:05:20,981 --> 00:05:21,814
and catastrophes and actually nor do I,
nobody wants a horrible cataclysm to 

120
00:05:25,121 --> 00:05:25,954
occur.
But this is the point which is that the 

121
00:05:28,511 --> 00:05:29,344
prospect of a comet or asteroid 
cataclysm on the earth is actually much 

122
00:05:32,831 --> 00:05:36,730
higher than has been told to us up till 
now.

123
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,593
And something can be done about it.
It doesn't have to be the end of the 

124
00:05:40,271 --> 00:05:41,800
world.
We don't have to say,

125
00:05:41,801 --> 00:05:42,611
okay,
it's all over.

126
00:05:42,611 --> 00:05:44,080
Forget about it.
Quite the contrary,

127
00:05:44,081 --> 00:05:44,914
this is,
this is just something that would be 

128
00:05:45,851 --> 00:05:46,684
prudent and rational for the human 
species to do and amongst many other 

129
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:54,490
imprudent and irrational things that we 
focus on.

130
00:05:54,491 --> 00:05:55,324
Instead,
we should be focusing on a bit on this 

131
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,093
at least just to heighten awareness of 
it and and also the possibility that we 

132
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:05,330
been nailed a bunch of times and we've 
forgotten about it and this is,

133
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:08,270
this is the big thing that you've been 
dealing with your entire career,

134
00:06:08,271 --> 00:06:11,240
this skepticism about past 
civilizations.

135
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,760
I mean,
I got into it with Michael Shermer,

136
00:06:13,761 --> 00:06:16,280
who's a friend of mine who's a very 
famous skeptic.

137
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,143
I got into him with it yesterday because
I posted that you were going to be on 

138
00:06:21,921 --> 00:06:26,180
and he started chirping something about 
civilizations 12,000

139
00:06:26,181 --> 00:06:27,730
years ago.
Where's the evidence on like,

140
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:28,703
dude,
you don't even,

141
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,593
you're saying this and you don't even 
know about gold Beckley tappy so I sent 

142
00:06:32,481 --> 00:06:33,314
him,
go back to the tapping.

143
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,153
Literally like five hours later he wrote
something claiming that while that was 

144
00:06:37,911 --> 00:06:38,744
made by hunter gatherers,
it was all just really to sort of suit 

145
00:06:40,881 --> 00:06:42,830
his narrative.
So he doesn't know that.

146
00:06:42,831 --> 00:06:43,664
No one knows that.
He knows that they are so determined to 

147
00:06:45,771 --> 00:06:48,920
keep the existing model and when new 
evidence comes in,

148
00:06:48,921 --> 00:06:50,990
which company explained by the existing 
model,

149
00:06:50,991 --> 00:06:54,920
they just tried to explain away the new 
evidence and not not think,

150
00:06:54,921 --> 00:06:57,050
maybe it's time to change our theory.

151
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:57,801
You know,
this is,

152
00:06:57,801 --> 00:06:59,540
this is the,
and the unfortunate thing,

153
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:04,280
but cataclysms a global cataclysm,
the massive event that happened 12,800

154
00:07:04,281 --> 00:07:06,590
years ago,
the younger dryas impact,

155
00:07:06,591 --> 00:07:09,230
which were a series of comet impacts on 
the North American ice cap.

156
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:13,010
This accounts for why we don't have a 
lot of evidence,

157
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:14,773
hard evidence of a 12,000
plus year old civilization because it 

158
00:07:17,241 --> 00:07:19,880
went down in that catastrophe was wiped 
out.

159
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,103
I've been trying to amass the evidence 
actually that compliments what Graham 

160
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:27,230
was doing and it really answers that 
question at schermer brought up,

161
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:29,720
and it's a legitimate question,
where's the evidence?

162
00:07:29,721 --> 00:07:30,554
But I'm quite sure that Schermer is not 
really educated in the extreme events 

163
00:07:36,111 --> 00:07:40,280
that have really taken place on this 
planet in the last 10 to 20,000

164
00:07:40,281 --> 00:07:41,114
years.
Um,

165
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,580
and what that would do to any kind of 
evidence.

166
00:07:43,581 --> 00:07:45,320
And maybe while we have some time here 
today,

167
00:07:45,321 --> 00:07:46,154
I brought a few things to try to convey 
some sense of how extreme some of these 

168
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:52,363
changes of ban and how one would 
actually be quite shocked to find 

169
00:07:55,731 --> 00:07:59,300
anything existing in the aftermath of 
these events.

170
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:01,280
Well,
Michael Shermer is a brilliant guy and I

171
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:02,480
don't mean to shit on him,
but,

172
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,373
but what,
what is disturbing to me is that his 

173
00:08:05,241 --> 00:08:06,074
knee jerk reaction to this without 
having any research at all in the 

174
00:08:08,811 --> 00:08:09,644
subject,
not knowing it all about go back like 

175
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,380
tabby,
which was discovered in what,

176
00:08:12,381 --> 00:08:14,150
the nineties yeah,
96.

177
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:16,160
So this is,
to me,

178
00:08:16,161 --> 00:08:19,580
this is something that I've looked at 
because of you guys in great depth.

179
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:20,443
When I read your book,
I was just completely enthralled with 

180
00:08:22,581 --> 00:08:24,860
this idea of history,
having some sort of,

181
00:08:24,861 --> 00:08:25,551
uh,
uh,

182
00:08:25,551 --> 00:08:28,340
or rise and fall and civilization having
these resets.

183
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,110
So I've been absorbed in it for a long 
time.

184
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:34,190
But what's fascinating to me is people 
that consider themselves to be skeptical

185
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:35,203
or you know,
or I mean he's a skeptic professional 

186
00:08:38,211 --> 00:08:39,044
issue,
but many people who question anything 

187
00:08:41,031 --> 00:08:41,864
that's outside of what they've been told
as soon as they hear any sort of a 

188
00:08:44,361 --> 00:08:45,590
theory outside of what they've been 
told,

189
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:48,580
the immediately call,
quackery and this.

190
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:49,543
But it's,
it's a weird knee jerk reaction to 

191
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:51,764
something,
especially when you talk about 

192
00:08:52,911 --> 00:08:56,160
asteroids,
that is a very real part of our past.

193
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:56,994
We have a ton of evidence.
I mean there's actual craters that you 

194
00:08:59,461 --> 00:09:01,800
can look at on earth.
The moon,

195
00:09:01,801 --> 00:09:04,380
which has no atmosphere is littered with
them.

196
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:08,370
And if we look at the moon as a model 
for what could possibly have happened to

197
00:09:08,371 --> 00:09:09,930
earth,
or at least you know,

198
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:10,853
some of them,
obviously with the moon having no 

199
00:09:12,571 --> 00:09:14,370
atmosphere,
it's going to get hit a lot more than we

200
00:09:14,371 --> 00:09:15,990
are.
But still,

201
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,920
and I mean this is a very real situation
that this,

202
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:21,900
this solar system,
you know,

203
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,700
it was,
was at least as far as we know the only,

204
00:09:23,701 --> 00:09:25,200
so it was solar system has to deal with 
this.

205
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:28,050
But we know this is a,
this is a real issue.

206
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,300
I mean we've seen impacts which like you
just said,

207
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,533
on one hand you have earth scientists 
looking at the earth and what they're 

208
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:34,614
realizing is that the earth is 
pockmarked with scars in each of these 

209
00:09:37,441 --> 00:09:40,640
scars represents a tremendously powerful
catastrophe,

210
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:41,503
has happened in the history of the earth
now that's accepted by mainstream 

211
00:09:43,981 --> 00:09:44,814
science that that major catastrophes 
have happened in the history of the 

212
00:09:47,701 --> 00:09:48,210
earth.

213
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:51,780
But where this thing now is about to 
come full circle is the recognition that

214
00:09:51,781 --> 00:09:52,614
these kinds of catastrophes of also 
influenced the rise and fall of 

215
00:09:55,051 --> 00:09:57,880
civilization and a lot more,
um,

216
00:09:58,710 --> 00:09:59,543
a lot more extremely than,
than has been recognized up to this 

217
00:10:01,981 --> 00:10:02,814
point.
And while geologists and 

218
00:10:03,861 --> 00:10:05,610
neuroscientists,
scientists are looking at the surface of

219
00:10:05,611 --> 00:10:07,250
the earth in realizing that,
um,

220
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,250
etched into the surface of the earth are
imprinted into the surface of the earth,

221
00:10:11,251 --> 00:10:12,084
are hundreds of scars of which are 
undoubtedly are only a small percentage 

222
00:10:15,271 --> 00:10:18,570
of the total that exist.
At the same time,

223
00:10:18,571 --> 00:10:23,571
astronomers are looking out into near 
space and discovering that we cohabitate

224
00:10:23,671 --> 00:10:26,220
space with a lot of stuff.
It's not as empty as we thought.

225
00:10:26,221 --> 00:10:27,780
And just within the last six or seven 
weeks,

226
00:10:27,781 --> 00:10:28,614
we've had two close flybys of previously
undiscovered that have previously 

227
00:10:32,491 --> 00:10:34,950
undiscovered asteroids.
This is the plank is NASA keeps saying,

228
00:10:34,951 --> 00:10:35,761
well there's,
you know,

229
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:38,220
there's,
we've counted 1,650

230
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:41,070
asteroids and none of them are going to 
hit the earth in the next hundred years.

231
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:41,551
Well,
yeah,

232
00:10:41,551 --> 00:10:43,740
that's true.
But what about all the ones they haven't

233
00:10:43,741 --> 00:10:46,710
counted,
which are estimated to run into hundreds

234
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:48,000
of thousands in which haven't been seen 
yet.

235
00:10:48,001 --> 00:10:52,410
And what happens is we see them roughly 
10 days before they passed the earth.

236
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,440
That is not enough time to do anything 
about them.

237
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:56,303
But we have time if we're prepared to be
rational and reasonable as a 

238
00:10:58,561 --> 00:11:02,340
civilization to take care of this issue.
Now when you're dealing with hundreds of

239
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,350
thousands of near Earth objects that are
flying around,

240
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,213
like what?
What are the things that could be done 

241
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:11,670
to protect earth?
You can paint.

242
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,633
It's low tech.
Actually you can paint one side of the 

243
00:11:14,221 --> 00:11:15,054
asteroid effect.
It's Albido so that the sun's rays push 

244
00:11:17,321 --> 00:11:19,410
differentially on one side rather than 
the other.

245
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,420
That will shift.
It's all bits slightly.

246
00:11:21,421 --> 00:11:24,600
It has to be calculated.
You can give it a little knock with,

247
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:25,171
uh,
with,

248
00:11:25,171 --> 00:11:26,140
with a,
a Rockett.

249
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:27,810
Basically,
you don't want to blow it up.

250
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,700
You don't want to turn,
you know,

251
00:11:29,701 --> 00:11:32,640
your one big piece of artillery shell 
into Buckshot.

252
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,020
You don't want to do that.
You want to,

253
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:37,350
you want to move it into a safer orbit.
You can mount jets on it.

254
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,600
People are looking now to mining 
asteroids,

255
00:11:39,601 --> 00:11:41,610
of course,
are our society always goes,

256
00:11:41,611 --> 00:11:44,050
I civilization always goes for the 
where,

257
00:11:44,051 --> 00:11:45,810
where the,
where the money's to be made.

258
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,960
But if we can mine asteroids,
we can move as to relates.

259
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,610
And,
and the technology is there.

260
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:51,683
And ironically,
the most dangerous asteroids are going 

261
00:11:53,561 --> 00:11:54,280
to be the ones

262
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,820
that are the closest to the earth,
which are the most accessible.

263
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:58,983
And the asteroids pretty much have 
unbelievable amounts of resources on 

264
00:12:03,671 --> 00:12:04,001
them.
I mean,

265
00:12:04,001 --> 00:12:04,834
pretty much everything that is being 
mined on the earth can be found in 

266
00:12:07,481 --> 00:12:11,620
asteroids from the hydrocarbons to 
precious metals to all of these things.

267
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:16,950
And we're not that far away from 
technologically being able to actually,

268
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:18,143
you know,
mount expeditions to asteroids and mind 

269
00:12:20,461 --> 00:12:21,400
them.
And that's,

270
00:12:21,401 --> 00:12:22,610
that's the,
the um,

271
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:23,683
you know,
that's the solution I kind of prefer 

272
00:12:24,731 --> 00:12:25,564
because again,
these things are tremendous sources of 

273
00:12:27,821 --> 00:12:28,511
reese,
of,

274
00:12:28,511 --> 00:12:29,344
of,
of all kinds of things that would be 

275
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:34,450
usable to an expanding civilization.
And,

276
00:12:34,451 --> 00:12:38,200
um,
we could feasibly within a decade or two

277
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:42,940
be mining asteroids and again,
the ones that are the easiest access are

278
00:12:42,941 --> 00:12:43,774
also going to be the ones that are more 
dangerous because they're the ones that 

279
00:12:45,851 --> 00:12:48,730
are coming to closest to the earth.
So,

280
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:54,010
and add another point here is that there
is one specific danger.

281
00:12:54,051 --> 00:12:54,884
There's one specific if you like,
region of the sky that really needs to 

282
00:12:57,501 --> 00:13:00,080
be looked at and this is,
this is the region of the sky.

283
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,153
This is why I wrote magicians of the 
gods because because of this discovery 

284
00:13:04,071 --> 00:13:06,410
that there's a thing called the taurid 
meteor stream,

285
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:07,693
which is 30 million kilometers wide and 
which envelops the solar system and the 

286
00:13:11,721 --> 00:13:16,460
earth on its orbit around the sun passes
through the Taurid meteor stream twice a

287
00:13:16,461 --> 00:13:17,294
year.
Turns out the Taurid meteor stream is 

288
00:13:20,121 --> 00:13:20,954
the debris of a giant comment that came 
in to the inner solar system about 

289
00:13:25,881 --> 00:13:27,290
20,000
years ago.

290
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:28,603
That thing was at least a hundred 
kilometers in diameter according to 

291
00:13:30,951 --> 00:13:33,170
their calculations if may have been more
so.

292
00:13:33,171 --> 00:13:34,850
And then like other comments like 
shoemaker,

293
00:13:34,851 --> 00:13:35,684
Levy nine which spectacularly hit 
Jupiter in 1994 it began to break up 

294
00:13:39,561 --> 00:13:43,700
into multiple fragments and those carry 
on orbiting on the original path,

295
00:13:43,701 --> 00:13:45,530
which and as they break up more and 
more,

296
00:13:45,531 --> 00:13:49,580
they degrade and small bits and large 
bits break off and it gradually fills up

297
00:13:49,581 --> 00:13:54,581
a kind of huge hoop of debris that the 
earth is passing through twice a year.

298
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:55,423
It takes us 12 days to pass through it.
We do two and a half million kilometers 

299
00:13:58,251 --> 00:14:01,700
a day on our orbital path,
12 days to get through the Taurid meteor

300
00:14:01,701 --> 00:14:06,470
stream and the scientists of of the 
comic research group have made the point

301
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:07,304
that a big object out of the Taurid 
meteor stream multiple objects as a 

302
00:14:11,151 --> 00:14:11,984
matter of fact,
was what hit the North American ice cap 

303
00:14:13,611 --> 00:14:15,260
12,800
years ago.

304
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:18,560
It looks like there was a second series 
of impacts 11,600

305
00:14:18,561 --> 00:14:19,394
years ago from the same source.
It looks like there were other impacts 

306
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:24,980
in the bronze age.
The most recent,

307
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:25,933
almost definite impact out of the Taurid
meteor stream was Tunguska in Siberia 

308
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:34,190
back in 1,908
that hit on the 30th of June 1,908

309
00:14:34,191 --> 00:14:37,100
and that's at the peak of the torrid 
June shower.

310
00:14:37,101 --> 00:14:39,950
When we pass through the Tory,
it's in June and in November.

311
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,273
And what they're saying is we really 
need to focus on this story of meteor 

312
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:44,660
stream.

313
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:48,980
Their calculations are that there are 
hundreds and hundreds of massive objects

314
00:14:48,981 --> 00:14:52,910
in that Taurid meteor stream and you as 
a comet breaks up into bits.

315
00:14:52,911 --> 00:14:53,744
It becomes those bits become asteroids 
and those asteroids are circling in the 

316
00:14:56,661 --> 00:14:57,494
Taurid meteor stream.
And I've likened it to strapping on a 

317
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:01,583
blindfold and crossing an eight lane 
interstate twice a year and just hoping 

318
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,120
that we don't hit any heavy traffic,
you know,

319
00:15:08,121 --> 00:15:12,200
that we meet bicycles or motorcycles 
rather than rather than trucks.

320
00:15:12,201 --> 00:15:13,034
But the trucks are out there.
And what the common research group 

321
00:15:15,141 --> 00:15:15,974
scientists are saying is we need now to 
be in depth investigating the Taurid 

322
00:15:19,851 --> 00:15:23,750
meteor stream because it appears to be 
the hidden hand in human civilization.

323
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:24,883
It is wiped out episodes of our history 
in the past and there's no reason to 

324
00:15:27,951 --> 00:15:28,784
expect that it won't do so again unless 
we do something about it because the 

325
00:15:32,811 --> 00:15:33,644
remnants of that original giant comment 
are still circling in the Tory of media 

326
00:15:36,651 --> 00:15:38,720
stream and they are fucking dangerous.

327
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:41,000
Now,
how is this being received in mainstream

328
00:15:41,001 --> 00:15:41,834
science?
I mean is there any resistance to this 

329
00:15:43,341 --> 00:15:44,174
because it seems like this is all pretty
straightforward and in traceable Mosley 

330
00:15:47,481 --> 00:15:49,940
being ignored,
mostly being ignored.

331
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I think that is why scientists who have 
a vested interest in other ideas,

332
00:15:55,011 --> 00:15:55,844
first of all,
there's a vested interest in not 

333
00:15:57,471 --> 00:16:00,050
admitting that cataclysms are important 
at all.

334
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:00,913
This goes right back to really to the 
19th century when science began to take 

335
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:06,374
shape in the form that we know it now 
and they wanted to separate themselves 

336
00:16:08,871 --> 00:16:09,704
off understandably from superstition.
So they didn't want anything to do with 

337
00:16:12,711 --> 00:16:14,720
something that sounds like the biblical 
flood,

338
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:15,613
for example.
They felt they would be contaminated by 

339
00:16:17,571 --> 00:16:18,404
that and they preferred to explain any 
cataclysmic evidence as a result of 

340
00:16:21,561 --> 00:16:22,394
gradual processes.
So you really think it's because of the 

341
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,733
reluctance to accept religion or 
religious ideas or to to separate 

342
00:16:29,211 --> 00:16:29,610
themselves.

343
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:31,250
I think that was the,
that's where it starts,

344
00:16:31,251 --> 00:16:33,350
where it started to separate them 
ourselves off from that.

345
00:16:33,351 --> 00:16:35,150
Now they've gone a long way from that.
And many,

346
00:16:35,151 --> 00:16:35,984
many scientists have got a vested 
interest in what is called 

347
00:16:37,941 --> 00:16:40,800
uniformitarianism more gradualism and 
they,

348
00:16:40,801 --> 00:16:41,634
they don't like to hear about cataclysms
having any major impact on the story of 

349
00:16:45,411 --> 00:16:46,950
life on earth.
So is it sort of the,

350
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,170
the momentum of these initial,
uh,

351
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,173
desires to escape religious influence 
that have sort of led them down this 

352
00:16:53,061 --> 00:16:53,900
path?
Yes.

353
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:54,763
And then there are others who have a 
vested interest in current accounts of 

354
00:16:57,471 --> 00:16:58,304
global warming and there's others who 
have a vested interest in extinctions 

355
00:17:01,281 --> 00:17:02,114
taking place.
Now they want to say that our ancestors 

356
00:17:03,651 --> 00:17:07,070
were responsible for the extinction of 
all the mammoths and mastodons and so on

357
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:07,904
and so forth.
Whereas the comment research group 

358
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:10,124
scientists are saying no,
those huge mega fauna of North America 

359
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:14,023
were wiped out as a result of the 
massive series of impacts on the North 

360
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:17,570
American ice cap.

361
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,730
I'm reading a book right now by Dan 
Flores.

362
00:17:19,731 --> 00:17:21,800
Really interesting book called Coyote 
America.

363
00:17:21,801 --> 00:17:24,350
He's a wildlife historian and he,
uh,

364
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:28,520
is really an expert on all the different
forms of wildlife in North America where

365
00:17:28,521 --> 00:17:30,500
they originated,
where they migrated to.

366
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:34,220
And one of the more fascinating things 
about it is he's talking about all these

367
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:35,810
animals that went extinct,
you know,

368
00:17:35,811 --> 00:17:37,160
10,000
plus years ago,

369
00:17:37,161 --> 00:17:41,480
this mass extinction event and never 
once does he bring up cataclysms.

370
00:17:41,481 --> 00:17:43,640
And there's all these different,
uh,

371
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,520
is different ideas.
And one of the big ones being that human

372
00:17:46,521 --> 00:17:50,070
beings with Adam [inaudible],
which is like really a very weird

373
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:50,903
sort of a spear throwing device and 
wiped out the wooly mammoths and all 

374
00:17:53,401 --> 00:17:55,920
these other animals and Tummy tuck 
posture,

375
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,133
lunatic idea.
I'll see if you have any contact with 

376
00:17:58,861 --> 00:17:59,694
hunter gatherer as today.
You find that a hunter gatherer peoples 

377
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,550
don't overkill that game.
They,

378
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:04,463
they hunt them respectfully,
they take what they need and they leave 

379
00:18:06,421 --> 00:18:08,610
the rest because it's a renewable 
resource for them.

380
00:18:08,611 --> 00:18:12,660
So I don't think hunter gatherers wiped 
out the mammoths in North America.

381
00:18:12,661 --> 00:18:14,400
The evidence is compelling.
It was the comment,

382
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,473
well,
the evidence that you brought up when 

383
00:18:16,141 --> 00:18:16,974
you were here the first time,
when you showed the images of all those 

384
00:18:18,961 --> 00:18:23,961
mammoths that had been literally knocked
over with broken legs from the impact of

385
00:18:24,661 --> 00:18:28,590
something mass burial grounds,
like these mass,

386
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:34,920
not burial grounds obviously,
but mass casualties mortality.

387
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:37,410
So it's a good way of putting it.
That's a good way of putting it.

388
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:37,951
Yeah.
In fact,

389
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,784
grandma,
I visited one up in South Dakota called 

390
00:18:40,141 --> 00:18:43,920
hot springs where there's just several 
dozen,

391
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,960
nobody knows how many are actually 
there,

392
00:18:45,961 --> 00:18:47,960
but there's at least several dozen,
uh,

393
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:49,943
two species,
woolly mammoths and Columbian mammoths 

394
00:18:51,391 --> 00:18:53,790
that have been in tuned.
And,

395
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:55,230
um,
while we were there,

396
00:18:55,231 --> 00:18:56,250
I interestingly,
I,

397
00:18:56,251 --> 00:18:56,970
you know,
the,

398
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:57,803
the guide,
the woman giving us the tour there was 

399
00:18:59,911 --> 00:19:02,760
kind of giving the a gradualist 
explanation.

400
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,320
Well,
over long periods of time,

401
00:19:04,321 --> 00:19:07,830
these mammoths wandered into a sinkhole 
and we're too dumb to get out.

402
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:11,010
And so they became in tuned and I asked 
the question,

403
00:19:11,011 --> 00:19:11,844
well,
what studies have been done on the 

404
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:17,580
sedimentary matrix in which their 
remains are being found?

405
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:18,763
Um,
because as I'm looking at this 

406
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:23,220
sedimentary matrix,
I'm seeing a massive deposit.

407
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:26,400
In other words,
a deposit that was instantaneous,

408
00:19:26,401 --> 00:19:28,650
instantaneous.
And when I brought that up,

409
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,820
she actually got very irritated and 
Miley,

410
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:32,730
they all got dismissed.

411
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:34,380
My question didn't,
um,

412
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:36,060
you know what,
we've got it all worked out.

413
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:36,431
You know,
we,

414
00:19:36,431 --> 00:19:37,500
we,
we know about that.

415
00:19:37,501 --> 00:19:38,700
Well,
what is it?

416
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:39,923
Well,
we've got it all worked out and then 

417
00:19:41,061 --> 00:19:41,894
immediately went on with her,
but yet I had an article that was 

418
00:19:46,741 --> 00:19:49,680
actually written by one of the original 
scientists or worked under site,

419
00:19:49,681 --> 00:19:50,590
and he,
he,

420
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,560
his description was,
well,

421
00:19:52,561 --> 00:19:55,500
it could have been that,
but also as an alternative.

422
00:19:55,501 --> 00:19:56,334
And he used the term bloat and float 
that what you had was wooly mammoths 

423
00:20:00,871 --> 00:20:03,150
that had been caught in a flood,
drowned,

424
00:20:03,151 --> 00:20:07,380
and they're bloated carcasses floated 
into a depression in the landscape,

425
00:20:07,381 --> 00:20:10,830
and that's where they were in tuned.
And that makes a whole lot more sense to

426
00:20:10,831 --> 00:20:12,750
me then the fact that,
you know,

427
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,240
individually,
over several thousand years,

428
00:20:15,241 --> 00:20:19,050
these in these mammoths wandered into 
this sinkhole and then couldn't get out.

429
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:21,030
Um,
but you've got to bear in mind we're,

430
00:20:21,031 --> 00:20:21,880
we're talking about,
you know,

431
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:22,733
at the end of the last ice age,
120 roughly species of megafauna 

432
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:27,493
disappeared,
which is about equivalent to the same 

433
00:20:28,951 --> 00:20:30,510
number of megafauna.

434
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:31,343
Species didn't habits.
The Earth today was a short period of 

435
00:20:33,601 --> 00:20:34,434
time,
was something like 65% of the north 

436
00:20:35,671 --> 00:20:38,430
American mammals when extinct 75 per 
75%.

437
00:20:38,431 --> 00:20:39,870
Yep.
Very short period of time,

438
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:40,704
very short period of time,
but pretty much totally coincident with 

439
00:20:43,531 --> 00:20:44,364
that period called the younger dryas.
And so there's nothing what we're 

440
00:20:48,521 --> 00:20:50,350
capable of doing today.
Back then,

441
00:20:50,351 --> 00:20:51,184
I mean,
when you look at human extinction 

442
00:20:52,031 --> 00:20:54,100
events,
human cause extinction events,

443
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,390
well,
it's very logical.

444
00:20:55,391 --> 00:20:56,224
And what we're doing today with 
pollution and the expanse of 

445
00:20:59,021 --> 00:21:02,410
civilization and weapons are a super 
sophisticated.

446
00:21:02,411 --> 00:21:03,244
If we wanted to,
we could wipe out a lot of different 

447
00:21:04,271 --> 00:21:05,104
species.
But what we're actually seeing is that 

448
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:10,120
at the end of what's called the Bowling 
Alley Rod,

449
00:21:10,121 --> 00:21:10,954
which was the gradual warming at the end
of the last ice age that preceded the 

450
00:21:15,881 --> 00:21:16,714
sudden catastrophic change at 12,800,
was it the clovis culture that existed 

451
00:21:20,801 --> 00:21:23,340
for three to 500 years,
I think somewhere,

452
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:25,450
but they suddenly were gone.

453
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,800
Right,
exactly.

454
00:21:26,801 --> 00:21:27,634
Simultaneous with the mammoths.
And then there are interesting studies 

455
00:21:29,981 --> 00:21:33,220
that are coming out now showing that at 
least continental wide,

456
00:21:33,221 --> 00:21:36,670
there was apparently a major human 
population crash.

457
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,533
Exactly coincident with the Megafauna 
extinctions because you had quarries 

458
00:21:41,141 --> 00:21:45,280
that had been mined for centuries that 
are suddenly abandoned.

459
00:21:45,281 --> 00:21:47,370
You have campsites that had been,
uh,

460
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,510
that had generations of,
of,

461
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:52,840
uh,
debris and in tool kits accumulating and

462
00:21:52,841 --> 00:21:54,940
so on debris from the,
from the,

463
00:21:54,941 --> 00:21:56,230
the,
the fluting of the,

464
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:59,080
the spear points and so on that are 
suddenly abandoned.

465
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,273
Right.
So the evidence actually suggests that 

466
00:22:02,051 --> 00:22:02,884
the human population crashed,
which would certainly imply that they 

467
00:22:06,521 --> 00:22:07,354
would have been far less capable of 
wiping out all of these species of 

468
00:22:10,391 --> 00:22:11,980
Megafaun.
Also the,

469
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:12,893
the studies of their,
their diet and their lifeways suggest 

470
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:15,923
that they were very quite diverse.
They were hunter gatherers and they 

471
00:22:18,731 --> 00:22:21,790
focus mostly on small game.
They ate a lot of fish,

472
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:24,400
a lot of shellfish.
They gathered food.

473
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:29,700
And why would they go after the biggest,
most dangerous animal,

474
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,180
you know,
in the end,

475
00:22:31,181 --> 00:22:32,180
the whole,
um,

476
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:34,270
and the whole array of,
of animal

477
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:35,223
and with incredible efficiency,
hunt them to extinction in a hundred 

478
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:38,861
years.
It doesn't make sense.

479
00:22:38,861 --> 00:22:40,060
No,
it makes no sense.

480
00:22:40,061 --> 00:22:41,890
And it seems pretty silly.
It,

481
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:42,913
and especially from that time of her may
say rattled mentioned the clovis 

482
00:22:45,761 --> 00:22:48,580
culture.
This is for a very long time,

483
00:22:48,581 --> 00:22:49,414
really until just a couple of years ago,
all of the mainstream academics in the 

484
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:53,914
fields of archeology and anthropology 
were saying there were no human beings 

485
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:00,760
in North America before,
let's say 13,000

486
00:23:00,761 --> 00:23:02,680
years ago,
give or take 500 years.

487
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:06,820
They came across the bering land bridge.
The Bering Strait at that time was above

488
00:23:06,821 --> 00:23:08,140
water.
Sea level was lower.

489
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,870
They entered the Americas then they 
weren't hit there before.

490
00:23:10,871 --> 00:23:11,704
Now in the last two to three years,
there's just been a whole raft of new 

491
00:23:14,711 --> 00:23:15,544
scientific research and no scientist 
today is prepared to defend the clovis 

492
00:23:19,511 --> 00:23:21,160
model anymore.
It's accepted,

493
00:23:21,161 --> 00:23:21,994
of course,
that have been human beings in America 

494
00:23:23,261 --> 00:23:26,860
for fifty thousand sixty thousand years,
and there's weird genetic links,

495
00:23:26,861 --> 00:23:30,970
like for example,
there's a trace that connects aboriginal

496
00:23:30,971 --> 00:23:34,360
Australians with North Americans.
They had a common ancestor.

497
00:23:34,361 --> 00:23:36,640
It's a very peculiar thing that's going 
on,

498
00:23:36,641 --> 00:23:37,474
and so what happens is that actually the
scientific models which constrain and 

499
00:23:40,901 --> 00:23:41,734
restrict research for so long do get 
overthrown and that clovis model is 

500
00:23:45,561 --> 00:23:46,310
being overthrown

501
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:48,170
and what the missing piece of the puddle
puzzle,

502
00:23:48,171 --> 00:23:51,350
I think for everybody working in this 
field is the cataclysm.

503
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,213
The comment,
what happened between twelve thousand 

504
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:56,091
eight hundred and eleven thousand six 
hundred years ago,

505
00:23:56,091 --> 00:23:56,924
which changed everything?
Is it be bizarre to you guys or 

506
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:02,780
frustrating in any way that this is not 
a mainstream idea?

507
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,940
This is,
this is very much fringe,

508
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:05,893
but yet it's,
it's not something that we don't have 

509
00:24:08,601 --> 00:24:09,610
any evidence.
Whenever,

510
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:13,520
whenever I put out a book,
I'm immediately,

511
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,740
there's this,
there's this huge hostile reactions.

512
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,110
The Michael Shermer thing,
like the Michael Shermer thing.

513
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,270
I mean,
I would say magicians of the gods,

514
00:24:20,271 --> 00:24:21,104
which I published it in 2015 which deals
with his whole comedy issue is actually 

515
00:24:23,781 --> 00:24:27,410
the most thoroughly documented,
the most thoroughly referenced book that

516
00:24:27,411 --> 00:24:28,790
I've ever written.
It's calm,

517
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:30,980
it's measured.
They actually don't read it.

518
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:31,671
They just say,
oh,

519
00:24:31,671 --> 00:24:34,010
Hancock's brought out another book.
He's a pseudo scientists.

520
00:24:34,011 --> 00:24:36,380
That's what they always call me,
or a pseudo archaeologist.

521
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:37,341
Um,
and,

522
00:24:37,341 --> 00:24:40,400
and it's obviously rubbish because it 
disagrees with everything that we know.

523
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:41,503
Well,
that's the point of the heretic in 

524
00:24:42,501 --> 00:24:45,560
society is to offer an alternative view 
and,

525
00:24:45,561 --> 00:24:47,570
and,
and well documented evidence.

526
00:24:47,571 --> 00:24:51,680
But it seems that we're dealing with 
such a deeply ingrained mindset,

527
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:52,843
which is connected in curious ways to 
power structures in our society that 

528
00:24:55,581 --> 00:24:57,080
it's very difficult to change it

529
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,111
absolutely.
In,

530
00:24:58,111 --> 00:24:58,710
in,
in here.

531
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:00,840
Like Greg mentioned earlier,
there's kind of a,

532
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:02,363
it went from a religious motive I think 
in the 19th century and now it's more a 

533
00:25:05,191 --> 00:25:07,020
political motive.
And again,

534
00:25:07,021 --> 00:25:10,590
the idea that every day you'll find 
something,

535
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:11,453
you know,
coming from various factions that or 

536
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:17,760
we're destroying the earth and the earth
has never suffered this kind of,

537
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:21,090
you know,
assault on it before and,

538
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:22,283
and you know,
we're causing the sixth great mass 

539
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:24,564
extinction and we're going to cause 
catastrophic global warming if we pump 

540
00:25:28,481 --> 00:25:29,314
another 50 or a hundred parts per 
million of carbon dioxide into the 

541
00:25:32,461 --> 00:25:33,450
atmosphere.
And,

542
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:37,740
and so what that has done is like many,
I won't say many,

543
00:25:37,741 --> 00:25:38,574
but several of the scientists now that 
have been in the forefront of 

544
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,233
criticizing the younger dryas impact 
hypothesis are also very much involved 

545
00:25:48,121 --> 00:25:48,954
in the global warming movement.
And the idea that we are now 

546
00:25:52,471 --> 00:25:56,790
precipitating the sixth grade mass 
extinction having looked now at,

547
00:25:56,791 --> 00:25:57,624
at mass extinctions and been really an 
obsession of mine for about 30 years 

548
00:26:01,441 --> 00:26:02,274
now.
I've looked at everything from the 

549
00:26:03,091 --> 00:26:05,430
cretaceous tertiary that the Permian 
Triassic,

550
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:06,803
you know,
right on down the line to the most 

551
00:26:08,131 --> 00:26:08,964
recent one,
which to me is really in some ways the 

552
00:26:10,351 --> 00:26:13,770
most interesting because the most recent
mass extinction that we're talking about

553
00:26:13,771 --> 00:26:16,260
is the one that took place.
While we humans,

554
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,720
we're,
we're a part of the,

555
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,550
of the story and

556
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:21,603
between twelve thousand eight hundred 
and eleven thousand six hundred years 

557
00:26:23,501 --> 00:26:24,490
ago,
the younger Dryas,

558
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,690
yes,
the younger dryas,

559
00:26:25,691 --> 00:26:30,040
which is still an unexplained climate 
anomaly that happened.

560
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,650
Um,
and I mentioned this I think in previous

561
00:26:32,651 --> 00:26:33,550
broadcasts it's,
you know,

562
00:26:33,551 --> 00:26:34,384
what you had was you had to spasm of,
of extreme warming followed by rapid 

563
00:26:39,041 --> 00:26:43,030
shifting into extreme cold,
literally within a matter of a few.

564
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:44,010
And

565
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:44,843
we're talking about um,
climate changes that are up to 15 

566
00:26:47,791 --> 00:26:51,360
degrees Fahrenheit within perhaps one to
five years,

567
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:55,650
which utterly dwarfs anything that we've
experienced in the last,

568
00:26:55,651 --> 00:27:00,330
since the industrial revolution began.
And we still don't really understand.

569
00:27:00,331 --> 00:27:04,650
And that's why this research is so 
important because now we understand that

570
00:27:04,651 --> 00:27:06,690
there was something cosmic that 
happened.

571
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:10,020
It's left its imprint in the landscape 
over what,

572
00:27:10,021 --> 00:27:13,500
four continents,
five continents now of a over 50 million

573
00:27:13,501 --> 00:27:14,334
square kilometers of the Earth's surface
is a Gi giant debris field of their 

574
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:22,020
stuff that is only produced by massive 
impacts.

575
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:22,863
These things come in at 70,000
miles an hour and you know if they have 

576
00:27:27,871 --> 00:27:29,400
any diameter at all,
if they're,

577
00:27:29,401 --> 00:27:32,790
if they're a hundred meters or more in,
in diameter,

578
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:33,653
they are,
they are going to hit the earth really 

579
00:27:34,951 --> 00:27:35,784
hard.
They're not going to burn up in the 

580
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:38,010
atmosphere.
And when they do,

581
00:27:38,011 --> 00:27:40,050
they pack a huge amount of kinetic 
energy,

582
00:27:40,051 --> 00:27:42,120
a huge amount of heat and shock.

583
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,390
And that creates very definite chemical 
products.

584
00:27:45,391 --> 00:27:47,550
So nano diamonds,
so carbons,

585
00:27:47,551 --> 00:27:49,080
fareol's,
so melt glass,

586
00:27:49,081 --> 00:27:53,220
let's like the trinity site that was 
produced in nuclear explosions.

587
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:54,263
All of these,
when they're all found together in the 

588
00:27:55,531 --> 00:27:56,364
same layer of soil,
and when you can put a date on that 

589
00:27:58,621 --> 00:28:01,050
layer of soil and when it's all over the
world,

590
00:28:01,051 --> 00:28:04,050
there's only one thing can explain them,
a massive cosmic it.

591
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:06,990
I don't understand why this is 
controversial.

592
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,460
I really don't.
I mean I do.

593
00:28:08,461 --> 00:28:09,294
I understand it because I know that once
people start teaching things and once 

594
00:28:11,281 --> 00:28:13,290
people start doing lectures and giving 
speeches,

595
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:15,900
they want to stick to their guns and 
they want to,

596
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:19,860
they want to somehow or another avoid 
anything that's going to contradict what

597
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:22,810
what they've been espousing.
It's gay.

598
00:28:22,811 --> 00:28:24,750
This is a game changer.
This information,

599
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:25,603
it changes everything.
It changes the way we've looked at our 

600
00:28:27,751 --> 00:28:28,230
past.

601
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:29,063
It changes the whole story of archeology
and it changes the way we're going to 

602
00:28:31,591 --> 00:28:32,424
look at the future.
I think that people in academia are 

603
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:36,773
reluctant to embrace that change and 
they're afraid of being called pseudo 

604
00:28:40,711 --> 00:28:41,544
scientists because there's a whole lobby
of skeptics who use this word pseudo 

605
00:28:44,401 --> 00:28:45,234
scientist or a pseudo archeologist as an
instant dismissal of other ideas and 

606
00:28:48,781 --> 00:28:49,614
those who are in the profession,
they don't want to get tarred with that 

607
00:28:51,781 --> 00:28:52,614
brush.
They want to keep themselves clean and 

608
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:56,310
can understand that.
But you're talking about hard evidence.

609
00:28:56,311 --> 00:28:58,320
Yeah.
You're talking about this nuclear glass.

610
00:28:58,321 --> 00:28:59,154
You're talking about nano diamonds.
You're talking about core samples that 

611
00:29:01,111 --> 00:29:04,530
show this massive shift when you do the 
ice core samples,

612
00:29:04,531 --> 00:29:05,364
massive shift in temperature,
and you're talking about a very clear 

613
00:29:07,861 --> 00:29:11,130
evidence of impacts that we know exist.
It's not like a calm,

614
00:29:11,131 --> 00:29:11,964
it's a theory.

615
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:13,680
It's not like it's big foot or something
like,

616
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,060
you know,
like what we're looking for.

617
00:29:15,061 --> 00:29:17,520
The final piece of evidence that shows 
that comma is a real thing.

618
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:18,660
Exactly.
It's real.

619
00:29:18,661 --> 00:29:19,800
It's totally,
it's totally,

620
00:29:19,801 --> 00:29:20,634
it's totally real.
But it's so difficult for those who are 

621
00:29:23,581 --> 00:29:24,414
invested in other models to accept and 
unfortunately they have the ear of the 

622
00:29:26,971 --> 00:29:28,140
media.
It's the,

623
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:29,550
it's uh,
there are all,

624
00:29:29,551 --> 00:29:30,384
by the way,
all the scientists in the comic comic 

625
00:29:31,571 --> 00:29:32,404
research group are absolutely mainstream
scientists and they have taken a lot of 

626
00:29:36,901 --> 00:29:41,010
flack from their colleagues for even 
daring to investigate this area.

627
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:41,980
Why they've had no

628
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,690
funding.
They've had to fund themselves.

629
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:48,340
That is so crazy because this is not a 
controversial thing in my mind.

630
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,960
It shouldn't be.
It should not be.

631
00:29:49,961 --> 00:29:52,660
This is not an airy fairy thing.
We're not talking about psychics.

632
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:53,703
We're not talking about Ufos.
Were were talking about something we 

633
00:29:55,601 --> 00:29:56,434
know exists,
so to bury your head in the sand over 

634
00:29:58,751 --> 00:30:02,500
something like this seems to me vested 
interests tested interest right now.

635
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:03,334
Now say spending the equivalent of a one
attack helicopter a year on 

636
00:30:08,111 --> 00:30:10,600
investigating the comets and asteroids 
danger,

637
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:12,130
you know,
$50 million a year.

638
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:14,590
That's not that much.
It's peanuts.

639
00:30:14,591 --> 00:30:15,910
It's a tiny,
it's a minuscule,

640
00:30:15,911 --> 00:30:16,744
some hundreds of billions of dollars on 
on massive sophisticated military 

641
00:30:20,711 --> 00:30:21,544
equipment,
which we can use to slaughter one 

642
00:30:23,141 --> 00:30:23,974
another in evermore sophisticated ways,
but just $50 million a year on saving 

643
00:30:28,151 --> 00:30:28,984
the earth from,
from a potential cataclysm that could 

644
00:30:30,581 --> 00:30:33,580
put our civilization back into the stone
age tomorrow.

645
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:37,180
And I don't mean to keep harping on 
Michael Shermer because I liked Michael,

646
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:38,103
but he,
he highlights this sort of natural 

647
00:30:41,651 --> 00:30:42,484
inclination to poke fun at something 
that he has done no research on 

648
00:30:45,971 --> 00:30:47,920
whatsoever.
When I pointed out,

649
00:30:47,921 --> 00:30:50,980
go back Lee Tappi and I sent him some 
articles from national geographic,

650
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:51,963
he went radio silent.
I mean cause just like he should know 

651
00:30:54,791 --> 00:30:56,650
about it.
It's astonishing.

652
00:30:56,651 --> 00:30:58,880
The number of people will mocking it.
Yeah,

653
00:30:59,140 --> 00:30:59,973
you're going to mock it.
You should actually know what you're 

654
00:31:01,061 --> 00:31:02,560
mocking.
And to say that,

655
00:31:02,561 --> 00:31:04,690
go back to the tempe was created by Hud 
together as well.

656
00:31:04,691 --> 00:31:06,130
I'm sorry.
That's just a theory.

657
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:07,263
That's not it.
That's not a fact that you have a 

658
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:13,240
sophisticated site with astronomical 
alignments with hundreds and hundreds of

659
00:31:13,241 --> 00:31:15,430
megalithic pillars weighing up to 20 
tons each.

660
00:31:15,431 --> 00:31:18,550
The world's first perfectly aligned 
north south building,

661
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,380
which you can only do with astronomy.

662
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:22,810
This is,
it's not enough to say,

663
00:31:22,811 --> 00:31:23,644
oh,
they were just hunter gatherer is there 

664
00:31:24,281 --> 00:31:26,860
was something as strong from a half a 
mile away.

665
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:27,940
Yeah.
I mean there's,

666
00:31:27,941 --> 00:31:29,950
there's some serious sophistication.
I mean,

667
00:31:29,951 --> 00:31:31,270
what,
how big were these stones?

668
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:32,080
Well,
the,

669
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,970
the biggest one actually still in the 
quarry,

670
00:31:33,971 --> 00:31:35,500
they left it because it had a fault in 
it.

671
00:31:35,501 --> 00:31:38,050
They clearly intended to move it 50 
tons.

672
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:40,410
You're looking at 20 foot high objects 
and they,

673
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:42,790
and then it's the,
it's the putting together of them.

674
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:44,590
See,
here's the problem.

675
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:45,953
Hunter gatherer societies are not the 
kinds of societies that produce large 

676
00:31:50,711 --> 00:31:52,330
scale fixed monuments.
Why?

677
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:53,463
Because they don't generate a surplus.
You can't pay for somebody to become an 

678
00:31:56,711 --> 00:32:00,520
architect and four of those times 
somebody to come and astronomy,

679
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,770
you'd busy hunting and gathering and 
that's what you do.

680
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:05,740
Agriculture generates a surplus and 
that's the,

681
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:09,250
that is the problem at Gabelli Tapi 
because there is no background.

682
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:13,300
This site just appears out of nowhere,
a midst what appears to be a hunter,

683
00:32:13,301 --> 00:32:14,134
gather a community.
But what they're not considering is the 

684
00:32:15,551 --> 00:32:16,384
possibility.
We're looking at a technology transfer 

685
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:19,323
that the survivors of a lost 
civilization who already had all that 

686
00:32:22,421 --> 00:32:23,254
knowledge came to go back,
Lee Tepi and use that site as a center 

687
00:32:26,381 --> 00:32:27,214
of initiation to teach the local hunter 
gatherer is how to do agriculture and 

688
00:32:30,671 --> 00:32:34,060
that's now taken as the beginnings of 
civilization.

689
00:32:34,061 --> 00:32:37,630
I would say it is the reinvention or the
re making of civilization.

690
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:40,130
So when we're looking at Summa,

691
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:45,140
there are any artifacts we find ancient 
Mesopotamia and that area of Iraq.

692
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:48,830
Those are the people that are sort of 
reinventing and relearning.

693
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,110
Well that that's hence all those.
They,

694
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,940
when we talk of Mesopotamia,
which means between two rivers,

695
00:32:53,941 --> 00:32:54,774
the Tigris and the Euphrates go Beckley.
Tempe is sitting right there in the 

696
00:32:57,391 --> 00:32:59,610
headwaters between the Tigris and 
Euphrates.

697
00:32:59,611 --> 00:33:00,444
And we cannot separate that from the 
later cultures that enter history five 

698
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,153
thousand six thousand years ago.
They're part of the lineage that 

699
00:33:06,661 --> 00:33:08,850
descended from Gore Beckley,
Tempe Times.

700
00:33:08,851 --> 00:33:12,660
And what's fascinating about Gabelli 
Tempe is the way it doesn't fit the way.

701
00:33:12,661 --> 00:33:13,494
There's no background to it that you 
would expect to see them practicing 

702
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:20,670
learning architectural skills.
The oldest stuff should be the worst.

703
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,320
And as they carry on,
it gets better.

704
00:33:22,321 --> 00:33:25,680
That site ran for a thousand years.
The best stuff is the oldest.

705
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:28,680
A thousand years later,
what they were producing wasn't so good.

706
00:33:28,681 --> 00:33:30,960
This is a real anomaly and it needs to 
be investigated,

707
00:33:30,961 --> 00:33:31,794
not mocked by skeptics,
but actually explore to consider maybe 

708
00:33:34,501 --> 00:33:38,300
this does rock the whole paradigm.
And it's kind of ironic

709
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,133
that in their desire to get away from 
the ancient myths and tales in the 

710
00:33:42,261 --> 00:33:43,094
Bible,
they've ignored those ancient myths and 

711
00:33:45,091 --> 00:33:47,780
tales,
which all talk about cataclysms.

712
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:49,123
Well,
part of our modern psychology is to 

713
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,153
imagine that we are somehow so far 
advanced from our predecessors that we 

714
00:33:56,361 --> 00:33:58,640
now represent the pinnacle of 
civilization.

715
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:03,400
And anything to proceeded us has to be 
looked upon almost is as if the,

716
00:34:03,401 --> 00:34:04,234
the workings of children.
It requires a major psychological shift 

717
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:13,550
to admit or accept that our ancestors 
who may have been far,

718
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:18,140
far more sophisticated than,
than we had imagined in our 19th century

719
00:34:18,141 --> 00:34:18,974
models,
which basically still dominate thinking 

720
00:34:20,931 --> 00:34:22,280
today.
And,

721
00:34:22,281 --> 00:34:23,031
um,
you know,

722
00:34:23,031 --> 00:34:23,864
in Graham's book he devotes several 
chapters to the story of one 19th or 

723
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:31,370
20th century heretic.
J Harlan Brett's in his story to me,

724
00:34:31,371 --> 00:34:32,204
kind of encapsulates the whole,
the whole process of forcing this 

725
00:34:36,021 --> 00:34:37,130
paradigm shift.

726
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:38,383
And for years he was out there exploring
this evidence that there had been this 

727
00:34:41,061 --> 00:34:42,650
tremendous flooding in,
uh,

728
00:34:42,651 --> 00:34:44,150
in,
in Washington state.

729
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,433
And all of his critics were dismissive 
without ever even going out and looking 

730
00:34:48,831 --> 00:34:53,831
at the evidence firsthand in the field.
But what he did was he stuck to his guns

731
00:34:53,961 --> 00:34:54,794
for three decades and continued to amass
evidence to the point where they just 

732
00:34:59,661 --> 00:35:01,790
couldn't,
they couldn't dismiss it anymore.

733
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:03,860
And finally,
um,

734
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:05,800
a group of them went out,
um,

735
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:08,470
and began to explore the,
the,

736
00:35:08,471 --> 00:35:11,450
the landscapes for themselves in one of 
the leaders.

737
00:35:11,451 --> 00:35:13,040
I think you talked about it in your 
book,

738
00:35:13,041 --> 00:35:13,874
James Gillooly,
who was sort of the leader of the 

739
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:16,823
skeptic faction that had set out their 
sole purpose was to discredit and lay 

740
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:24,620
this whole flood heresy to rest once and
for all.

741
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:25,993
But he went out into field and they 
spent about eight days in the field 

742
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:32,960
where he's seeing this evidence for 
himself over and over again.

743
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:35,210
And when you're looking at just one 
piece of it,

744
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:36,710
you might be able to say,
okay,

745
00:35:36,711 --> 00:35:37,544
there's all other explanations for that.
But what happens is when you get 

746
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:44,220
multiple lines of evidence all 
converging,

747
00:35:44,221 --> 00:35:48,390
and there's no way to individually 
explain a way each one of those things,

748
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:49,740
other than just saying,
oh,

749
00:35:49,741 --> 00:35:52,230
well it's all coincidence.
He,

750
00:35:52,231 --> 00:35:56,730
this James Gillooly was honest enough so
that after a week out there,

751
00:35:56,731 --> 00:35:59,910
they were at a place called palouse 
falls in southern Washington,

752
00:35:59,911 --> 00:36:00,744
which was one of these areas where these
tremendous inland tsunami swept across 

753
00:36:05,131 --> 00:36:06,630
the land.
Um,

754
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:07,913
and I actually just visited there about 
eight weeks ago when I took a group of 

755
00:36:11,431 --> 00:36:12,580
people out there and,
and,

756
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:13,423
and took them to palouse falls to show 
them right on the spot where James 

757
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:19,200
Gillooly was standing when he finally 
had his epiphany.

758
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:21,420
Do you have any images of that that you 
brought with us?

759
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,580
I have images.
I can dig them up here.

760
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:24,840
Yeah,
I sure do.

761
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:25,763
Yeah.
I've got some really interesting images 

762
00:36:27,181 --> 00:36:28,380
to show you.
Um,

763
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,513
which relates because see this flooding 
stuff relates directly to the idea of 

764
00:36:32,821 --> 00:36:35,580
the impact and we can get into a little 
bit of that,

765
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:37,650
um,
explaining how,

766
00:36:37,651 --> 00:36:41,970
how these parallel lines of,
of evidence are now converging.

767
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:46,320
But the interesting thing about,
but Gillooly was that in the,

768
00:36:46,321 --> 00:36:47,154
in the,
uh,

769
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,730
uh,
descriptions of,

770
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:49,583
of the trip,
he wandered off by himself for a long 

771
00:36:52,381 --> 00:36:53,214
time away from the group.
And we're standing here looking at this 

772
00:36:56,070 --> 00:37:01,070
massive cataract with 400 foot cliffs in
this little tiny ribbon of water flowing

773
00:37:01,801 --> 00:37:06,090
over it in this huge canyon below it and
these big boulders.

774
00:37:06,091 --> 00:37:08,940
And he'd seen for a whole week he'd been
seeing this stuff.

775
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:13,980
And it finally got to the point where it
was undeniable and he walked back to the

776
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:16,950
group and the words out of his mouth 
verbatim where,

777
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:19,230
how could I have been so wrong?

778
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,753
And he finally admitted.
And at that that was like a turning 

779
00:37:22,771 --> 00:37:23,640
point.
And now,

780
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:24,703
and again,
Graham describes it's very effectively 

781
00:37:26,131 --> 00:37:26,964
in the book how in a,
in a way the flooding phenomena was 

782
00:37:29,641 --> 00:37:34,500
hijacked and then placed within this 
more gradual listic context,

783
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:36,090
um,
to,

784
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:40,360
to really to avoid the fact that it was 
something so anomalous in,

785
00:37:40,361 --> 00:37:41,194
so such a departure from our modern 
experience that we had to look outside 

786
00:37:44,701 --> 00:37:47,010
of our modern experience to find an 
explanation.

787
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:51,240
What they wanted to do was find 
something within our modern experience.

788
00:37:51,241 --> 00:37:52,074
And this is the cornerstone of the 
uniformitarian a approach is that we 

789
00:37:55,711 --> 00:37:59,100
look for a modern example and then we 
extrapolate backwards from that.

790
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:02,750
And so what they did was they saw,
well in,

791
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:04,800
in the modern term,
in the modern world,

792
00:38:04,801 --> 00:38:09,210
we have pro glacial lakes lake,
that's that form in front of glaciers.

793
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:13,020
And sometimes these pro glacial lakes 
might be held in by uh,

794
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:13,973
an ice dam or another glacier.
These ice dams will give away and they 

795
00:38:17,431 --> 00:38:18,264
will cause pretty catastrophic flooding.
They're very common up in Iceland 

796
00:38:21,721 --> 00:38:23,960
because you've got several volcanoes 
under the Wioa,

797
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,833
the Icelandic ice sheets.
And up there they use the term Yoga 

798
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:31,860
Lopes to describe these outburst floods.
But here's the thing,

799
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:34,140
when you look at the modern versions of 
it,

800
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:35,363
you basically are looking at floods that
are less than 1000th of one single flow 

801
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:43,000
from these floods we're talking about.
That happened,

802
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,190
you know,
12 and 13,000

803
00:38:45,191 --> 00:38:46,024
years ago,
1000 less than a thousandth less than a 

804
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:51,880
thousand then peak discharge and in 
total volume.

805
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,163
And,
and so in his been admitted in several 

806
00:38:55,181 --> 00:38:57,310
places,
I've extracted the quotes saying,

807
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:58,383
well,
we do admit that this is a major 

808
00:39:00,161 --> 00:39:02,530
extrapolation upwards,
but nevermind.

809
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,650
Yeah,
you know,

810
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:05,230
her

811
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:09,460
mind is so disturbing me.
See Holland breaths for for 30 years was

812
00:39:09,461 --> 00:39:11,260
walking the walk and the channel scab 
lands.

813
00:39:11,261 --> 00:39:13,560
And what he saw was evidence for,
um,

814
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,970
as he called it,
a humongous flood,

815
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,253
which,
which actually rosen fall within fell 

816
00:39:19,541 --> 00:39:21,170
within three weeks.
And,

817
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:26,110
and he went through decades of being put
aside by his colleagues in salted.

818
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,930
They mocked him,
they laughed at him just as the skeptics

819
00:39:28,931 --> 00:39:31,460
do today.
But gradually the evidence began to Matt

820
00:39:31,461 --> 00:39:33,910
and they couldn't deny it anymore that 
there had been,

821
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:37,180
there had been flooding.
And actually eventually they gave Harlan

822
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:38,740
Brett's j Harlan,
Brett's the penrose metal,

823
00:39:38,741 --> 00:39:40,330
which is the ultimate,
you know,

824
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:42,460
uh,
the ultimate bestowal of,

825
00:39:42,461 --> 00:39:46,330
of geology in America.
He got the accolade and he said it,

826
00:39:46,331 --> 00:39:48,400
that he was born more than 90 years old 
at that time.

827
00:39:48,401 --> 00:39:50,410
And he said at that time,
he said,

828
00:39:50,411 --> 00:39:53,800
all my enemies are dead,
so I have no one left a gloat over.

829
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:55,121
Um,
but,

830
00:39:55,121 --> 00:39:56,470
but the point is,
in a way,

831
00:39:56,471 --> 00:39:59,040
there was nothing to gloat about because
what they did was they,

832
00:39:59,070 --> 00:39:59,903
they,
they separated him from his central 

833
00:40:01,781 --> 00:40:04,120
idea.
Instead of accepting that there had been

834
00:40:04,121 --> 00:40:06,820
one huge flood.
And that was always his view.

835
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:07,900
They said,
oh,

836
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:11,230
there must have been 70 or 80 floods 
that caused all this damage.

837
00:40:11,231 --> 00:40:14,710
And that's what we're,
that's what we are seriously challenging

838
00:40:14,711 --> 00:40:15,544
right now.
It's so ironic in a way that the human 

839
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:21,790
desire for knowledge is what has led us 
to where we are today.

840
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:25,780
We have this insatiable desire for 
knowledge and for innovation,

841
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:30,640
but that same human desire to achieve is
also what,

842
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,153
what's the,
is responsible for that and the ego 

843
00:40:34,571 --> 00:40:38,650
blocks anything that's contrary to what 
you've already established as fact.

844
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:39,543
Exactly.
As soon as you see something that might 

845
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:45,250
throw a monkey wrench into the gears of 
what you've been teaching and practicing

846
00:40:45,251 --> 00:40:45,940
your whole life.

847
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:48,130
And I know that you've gone through this
with Egypt,

848
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:52,390
you're your whole issue with the Sphinx 
and with a doctor shock.

849
00:40:52,391 --> 00:40:53,224
And John Anthony West who was on the 
podcast last one was with you just 

850
00:40:55,511 --> 00:40:55,960
recently.
Yeah,

851
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,070
he's amazing.
By the way,

852
00:40:57,071 --> 00:40:58,030
I'm going to be doing,
uh,

853
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:02,470
an event in New York with John Anthony 
West and on the 29th of November where,

854
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:03,280
uh,
it's,

855
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:03,630
well,
it's,

856
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:04,241
it's,
again,

857
00:41:04,241 --> 00:41:05,074
it's linked on my website.
The details are on the talks and events 

858
00:41:07,211 --> 00:41:07,781
page.
It's in,

859
00:41:07,781 --> 00:41:10,270
it's in some church somewhere,
but I'm going to give a presentation and

860
00:41:10,271 --> 00:41:12,670
then I'm going to interview John Live on
live on stage.

861
00:41:12,671 --> 00:41:14,740
First Time I've ever done that.
I'm kind of,

862
00:41:14,741 --> 00:41:19,210
podcasting is such a character.
He's an amazing dude and um,

863
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:21,700
magical Egypt is,
I think one of the most important things

864
00:41:21,701 --> 00:41:25,090
that anybody could ever watch.
I think that DVD series is just insane.

865
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:29,250
It's so spectacular and so fantastic.
And next to going to Egypt without,

866
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:30,183
which I haven't done.
I think that's probably the second best 

867
00:41:32,231 --> 00:41:33,650
thing.
Just bet you bet.

868
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,070
And John

869
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:36,580
is an example of why we need heretics.
This is,

870
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:37,760
this is the thing,
you see that,

871
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:39,170
that the science today,
yes,

872
00:41:39,171 --> 00:41:40,004
you're right.
We have this thirst for knowledge and 

873
00:41:41,241 --> 00:41:42,074
it's k human characteristic,
but also we get invested in particular 

874
00:41:44,931 --> 00:41:47,060
positions and when people criticize 
those positions,

875
00:41:47,061 --> 00:41:47,894
we take it as an existential threat and 
where we get all angry and hot and 

876
00:41:51,081 --> 00:41:53,240
bothered about it.
If we allow that to happen too much,

877
00:41:53,241 --> 00:41:56,120
we don't keep a place for heretics in 
our society,

878
00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:58,130
then we're never going to do anything 
novel.

879
00:41:58,131 --> 00:42:01,700
We are gradually going to get locked 
down ossified into the,

880
00:42:01,701 --> 00:42:03,710
into the existing system we need 
heretics.

881
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:07,280
John has been the leading heretic on 
ancient Egypt for decades.

882
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,700
Pointing out that we should listen to 
what the ancient Egyptians said,

883
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,180
that their civilization was not a 
development,

884
00:42:14,181 --> 00:42:15,014
it was a legacy.
It was a legacy from the time of the 

885
00:42:16,881 --> 00:42:20,660
gods and that cost me back again to this
whole issue of a lost civilization.

886
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:24,110
Now when God Bagley,
tabby was discovered,

887
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:27,800
it vindicated you in so many ways,
but what are the possibilities,

888
00:42:27,801 --> 00:42:28,634
if any,
of more of these sites being explored 

889
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:31,400
and exposed?
A few.

890
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:32,383
Are there,
are there more that people are looking 

891
00:42:33,711 --> 00:42:35,960
at right now?
Are there any that are under the radar?

892
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:36,823
Just a year ago at the bottom of the 
Sicily channel at a depth of more than 

893
00:42:40,521 --> 00:42:45,260
120 feet.
It's been underwater for at least 9,000

894
00:42:45,261 --> 00:42:50,261
years is a huge megalithic sites.
Before the discovery of go Beckley Tepi,

895
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:53,000
that site could never have been 
explained.

896
00:42:53,001 --> 00:42:53,834
The dating is absolutely definite.
The seas rose and covered it at least 

897
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:57,110
9,000
years ago.

898
00:42:57,111 --> 00:42:57,944
We don't know how long it stood there 
before it was covered by the rising 

899
00:43:00,741 --> 00:43:02,900
seas.
But there it sits under water.

900
00:43:02,901 --> 00:43:07,340
And I think underwater discoveries or,
and I've had a part to play in this over

901
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:08,110
the years,
are,

902
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:09,290
are one of the ways forward.

903
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:13,850
We need to look at those areas because 
there was a 400 foot rise in sea level.

904
00:43:13,851 --> 00:43:14,684
At the end of the ice age.
You're looking at the amount of land 

905
00:43:17,031 --> 00:43:18,740
that would be put together in,
say,

906
00:43:18,741 --> 00:43:19,574
Europe and China added together.
That amount of land was swallowed by 

907
00:43:22,101 --> 00:43:22,934
those rising seas.
And archeology has largely proceeded 

908
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:28,220
without taking account of those lost 
lands.

909
00:43:28,221 --> 00:43:29,810
I'm not saying they haven't looked at 
all,

910
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:33,290
but they're primarily in marine 
archeology interested in shipwrecks.

911
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:34,641
Now this,
uh,

912
00:43:34,641 --> 00:43:37,360
this megalithic site is their images of 
this that we could look at.

913
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,710
There are,
yeah.

914
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:40,100
Yeah.
I can,

915
00:43:40,101 --> 00:43:41,800
I can probably find it,
um,

916
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:45,440
a monolith at the bottom of the Sicily 
channel.

917
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,060
Try that.
Try that.

918
00:43:47,061 --> 00:43:48,290
A search on that.
Pull that up,

919
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:49,133
Jamie.

920
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:52,281
But,
um,

921
00:43:52,281 --> 00:43:53,870
so what does this look like?
Is this,

922
00:43:53,871 --> 00:43:57,350
and this has been clearly established 
that this actually is the work of man.

923
00:43:57,370 --> 00:43:59,540
This is not some sort of a Yardang or 
something.

924
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:01,700
Of course there's dispute.
Of course,

925
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:04,670
the mainstream is not going to just 
accept this overnight,

926
00:44:04,671 --> 00:44:06,380
but again,
it's mainstream scientists are funded.

927
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:08,930
They're absolutely certain that they're 
dealing with a manmade site.

928
00:44:08,931 --> 00:44:11,030
There are holes drilled through these 
megaliths.

929
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:12,830
Uh,
one of them is very,

930
00:44:12,831 --> 00:44:13,664
very large.
There's a series of other megaliths 

931
00:44:15,531 --> 00:44:17,360
round about,
it's not a natural thing.

932
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:20,060
So here we're looking at some of her,
right?

933
00:44:20,110 --> 00:44:21,290
Yeah.
So there's that big,

934
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,720
big megalith broken into two parts right
there.

935
00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:24,980
Oh Wow.
Yeah.

936
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:25,851
And,
and,

937
00:44:25,851 --> 00:44:26,684
and this,
we can say often with archeological 

938
00:44:28,851 --> 00:44:30,800
sites,
the problem is dating them.

939
00:44:31,310 --> 00:44:32,280
You know,
for example,

940
00:44:32,281 --> 00:44:35,400
there are incredible megalithic temples 
all over the island of Malta,

941
00:44:35,401 --> 00:44:36,750
not far away from this place.

942
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:41,340
Incredible megalithic temples,
but they can't date the stone directly.

943
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:42,233
They have to date organic material 
associated with the stone and that can 

944
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:46,793
give them misleadingly young dates.
In a case of a site that's been covered 

945
00:44:49,531 --> 00:44:52,200
by sea level rise,
there can be no argument.

946
00:44:52,201 --> 00:44:54,540
Nobody went down there and built that 
9,000

947
00:44:54,541 --> 00:44:55,374
years ago.
It had to be built before the seas rose 

948
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:00,420
and that puts a minimum age on it of 
9,000

949
00:45:00,421 --> 00:45:01,254
years.
What are the best images that we can 

950
00:45:02,401 --> 00:45:04,080
look at it?
Cause right now I'm just seeing rocks.

951
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:04,943
It's very difficult cause I'm looking at
something that I mentioned and I'm 

952
00:45:07,021 --> 00:45:08,850
afraid that's all you're going to see.
Those are,

953
00:45:08,851 --> 00:45:12,360
those are the best images of it that 
exists over one right above that.

954
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:14,030
That's Indiana Goonie.
That's that.

955
00:45:14,210 --> 00:45:17,100
That's not in,
that's not in the Sicily channel.

956
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:18,270
So,
um,

957
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:21,270
what,
what are the biggest pieces down there?

958
00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:22,980
Is it this right here?
Is this what yeah,

959
00:45:22,981 --> 00:45:25,770
that big thing.
Big thing there is 30 feet long I think.

960
00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:27,930
And is it,
what,

961
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,850
what leads you to believe that this is 
manmade?

962
00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:31,883
The scientists who worked on it,
the fact that there are holes drilled 

963
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:35,633
through the stone,
the fact that you can go to neighboring 

964
00:45:37,381 --> 00:45:42,381
areas like Armenia and find Brealey,
very ancient megalithic sites where they

965
00:45:42,901 --> 00:45:46,210
have exactly the same kind of holes 
drilled through the stones and the whole

966
00:45:46,211 --> 00:45:49,080
seem to have been used for astronomical 
sightings.

967
00:45:49,081 --> 00:45:51,540
Now this sites a mass,
it's been knocked over by the sea.

968
00:45:51,541 --> 00:45:53,730
It's fallen down,
but we're seeing the same thing.

969
00:45:53,731 --> 00:45:55,530
Big megaliths with holes drilled through
them.

970
00:45:55,650 --> 00:45:59,740
And you're also dealing with 9,000
plus years of erosion and barnacle grows

971
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,313
all of that.
And the ocean is a difficult place to 

972
00:46:02,521 --> 00:46:03,290
work.
You know,

973
00:46:03,290 --> 00:46:03,920
it's,
it's a,

974
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:04,540
it's,
it does,

975
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:06,240
it's not easy.
Visibility can be bad.

976
00:46:06,241 --> 00:46:07,860
You're dealing with currents.
There's all kinds of,

977
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:09,870
all kinds of problems because this is 
the important just cubs,

978
00:46:09,871 --> 00:46:12,510
cameron and his crazy little summary in 
ringing James Cameron.

979
00:46:13,830 --> 00:46:14,663
Well I spent seven years scuba diving 
all around the world looking at this 

980
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:17,970
stuff.
And you know,

981
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:20,010
it's pretty convincing in my view.
Well

982
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:21,053
it is.
It does make sense that if we do know 

983
00:46:22,711 --> 00:46:23,544
for a fact and we do that the sea level 
rose dramatically at the end of the ice 

984
00:46:26,521 --> 00:46:28,410
age,
it makes sense that some things would be

985
00:46:28,411 --> 00:46:30,650
buried under the water.
Well in,

986
00:46:30,651 --> 00:46:33,030
during the Ice Age,
whatever,

987
00:46:33,031 --> 00:46:33,864
you know,
you don't have to talk about advanced 

988
00:46:34,921 --> 00:46:38,010
civilizations or anything,
but during the ice age,

989
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:41,250
living under coastlines in establishing 
your villages,

990
00:46:41,251 --> 00:46:43,950
communities and everything under 
coastlines would've been probably one of

991
00:46:43,951 --> 00:46:46,270
the most benign places,
um,

992
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:47,730
to get,
you know,

993
00:46:47,731 --> 00:46:48,630
because for one thing,
you're,

994
00:46:48,631 --> 00:46:49,464
you're down,
you're see the sea level of this 

995
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:52,720
presence of the c's is going to,
uh,

996
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:54,960
you know,
smooth out the climate and so forth.

997
00:46:54,961 --> 00:46:56,280
So,
you know,

998
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:57,173
you're going to have mold.
Probably most cultural development 

999
00:46:59,311 --> 00:47:01,220
during the ice age is going to be close 
to this,

1000
00:47:01,330 --> 00:47:04,110
to the sea.
So it's going to be underwater now,

1001
00:47:04,111 --> 00:47:05,730
just like grandma's was talking about.

1002
00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:10,380
Um,
and so this to me is probably the future

1003
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:11,353
of archeology is marine archeology where
a lot of discoveries are going to be 

1004
00:47:14,581 --> 00:47:15,640
made.
And,

1005
00:47:15,650 --> 00:47:16,483
and that particular thing,
I mean there's a lot of megalithic 

1006
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:19,373
structures around the world that if you 
set that thing up like this and put 

1007
00:47:22,891 --> 00:47:24,870
those siding holes through it,
um,

1008
00:47:25,590 --> 00:47:26,423
would,
would look precisely like scrape the 

1009
00:47:27,451 --> 00:47:29,530
barnacles off of it,
you know,

1010
00:47:29,531 --> 00:47:30,430
and,
and no one's saying,

1011
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:31,330
oh,
it's proven,

1012
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:34,090
but what it is is we have to keep an 
open mind and say,

1013
00:47:34,091 --> 00:47:34,924
well,
there are some very strong similarities 

1014
00:47:36,581 --> 00:47:38,890
here,
so let's investigate this thing further.

1015
00:47:38,891 --> 00:47:39,724
And that's the whole point of all this 
is all of this stuff needs more 

1016
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:43,773
research.
It doesn't need some cavalier dismissal 

1017
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:48,100
by somebody who's,
you know,

1018
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:53,120
protecting their own paradigm.
It needs more research on all fronts.

1019
00:47:53,321 --> 00:47:54,154
I mean,
because I think that there's enough 

1020
00:47:55,421 --> 00:47:56,254
evidence that has now accumulated to 
suggest that there is a deep history to 

1021
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:00,064
the human species on earth and we're 
just beginning to really appreciate how 

1022
00:48:03,281 --> 00:48:04,630
much deeper it really is.

1023
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:05,463
Then the conventional models of history 
and rather than just waving an arm and 

1024
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:11,260
dismissing this,
um,

1025
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:14,260
with a skeptical sneaker with a 
skeptical sneer.

1026
00:48:14,261 --> 00:48:15,730
Exactly.
Oh,

1027
00:48:15,731 --> 00:48:16,564
it's interesting is that there is an 
accepted scientific models of humanity 

1028
00:48:19,841 --> 00:48:21,720
when you're talking about 
supervolcanoes,

1029
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:24,580
right,
like the Super Volcano of 60 70,000

1030
00:48:24,581 --> 00:48:25,960
years ago.
Yeah.

1031
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:26,883
I mean they're,
they pretty much accept that that wiped 

1032
00:48:28,421 --> 00:48:31,060
out of the vast majority of human beings
on earth.

1033
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:35,980
And why is the super volcano hypothesis 
so easily accepted?

1034
00:48:35,981 --> 00:48:38,280
But yet the asteroidal impact,
I mean,

1035
00:48:38,281 --> 00:48:39,114
both of them are real events.
Both of them are historically 

1036
00:48:41,321 --> 00:48:42,550
documented.
In fact,

1037
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:43,773
we really don't,
we've never watched a supervolcano take 

1038
00:48:45,681 --> 00:48:46,514
over the world,
but we've seen asteroids hit other 

1039
00:48:48,461 --> 00:48:51,130
planets.
We've actually watched shoemaker Levy,

1040
00:48:51,131 --> 00:48:53,470
like you were talking about before,
we call them bonding Jupiter.

1041
00:48:53,471 --> 00:48:54,304
Unbelievable.
Bigger impact in the planet earth 

1042
00:48:56,051 --> 00:48:56,884
itself.
Yeah,

1043
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:57,540
yeah,

1044
00:48:57,540 --> 00:48:58,710
exactly.
Exactly.

1045
00:48:58,711 --> 00:48:59,940
So,
yeah,

1046
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:02,670
and actually more than 20 impacts each,
each,

1047
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:05,430
each one of them would have wiped out 
all life on earth if that,

1048
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:07,690
if that object at hit the earth.
Yeah.

1049
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:08,700
So,
you know,

1050
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:09,481
so it's a,
it's a,

1051
00:49:09,481 --> 00:49:12,750
it's another thing to when we were 
talking about underwater structures,

1052
00:49:12,751 --> 00:49:14,760
but let's also consider the possibility,
and again,

1053
00:49:14,761 --> 00:49:16,680
John Anthony West work is important 
here.

1054
00:49:16,681 --> 00:49:20,730
Let's also considered the possibility 
that we have miss identified a number of

1055
00:49:20,731 --> 00:49:21,564
structures that are standing in plain 
view like the Great Sphinx Egyptology 

1056
00:49:25,801 --> 00:49:28,860
read any age of logical text,
any encyclopedia.

1057
00:49:28,861 --> 00:49:32,280
Actually they will tell you that thing 
was put there by a specific pharaoh,

1058
00:49:32,550 --> 00:49:37,140
Pharaoh carfrae of the fourth dynasty 
round about 2,500

1059
00:49:37,141 --> 00:49:41,010
BC.
That is not a fact that is an opinion,

1060
00:49:41,430 --> 00:49:42,263
but it's presented as a fact.
There is not a single inscription that 

1061
00:49:44,791 --> 00:49:48,780
relates the Sphinx to that fair or not a
contemporary inscription,

1062
00:49:48,781 --> 00:49:51,570
not one dating from 2,500
BC.

1063
00:49:51,850 --> 00:49:52,591
Um,
in fact,

1064
00:49:52,591 --> 00:49:53,424
there's nothing at all.
It's just the assumption because it's 

1065
00:49:55,501 --> 00:49:59,550
close to a pyramid which they assume the
same fair are built.

1066
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:02,760
Again on the absence of evidence that 
the Sphinx must have been built by them.

1067
00:50:02,761 --> 00:50:05,430
But John Anthony West was the first to 
see that.

1068
00:50:05,431 --> 00:50:06,264
Actually when we look at this thing,
we we're looking at a highly eroded 

1069
00:50:08,671 --> 00:50:09,504
stone object and that erosion is very 
odd and that's why he brought professor 

1070
00:50:13,081 --> 00:50:13,914
Robert Schoch,
professor of geology from Boston 

1071
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:18,990
University to Giza in 1992 to look at 
the Sphinx.

1072
00:50:18,991 --> 00:50:19,824
And say what actually caused this 
weathering on the Sphinx and shock 

1073
00:50:22,321 --> 00:50:23,154
immediately saw it,
what caused it was exposure to a very 

1074
00:50:25,831 --> 00:50:28,430
long period of heavy,
heavy,

1075
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:33,440
heavy rainfall and no such rains have 
fallen in Egypt in the last 5,000

1076
00:50:33,441 --> 00:50:34,274
years,
but they did fall during the younger 

1077
00:50:35,751 --> 00:50:36,584
dryas.
We had a prolonged rain out from this 

1078
00:50:38,661 --> 00:50:39,410
comet impact.

1079
00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:40,243
As that ice cap was pulverized and a 
massive amount of ice water was thrown 

1080
00:50:43,911 --> 00:50:46,190
up into the upper atmosphere,
prolonged grainer,

1081
00:50:46,191 --> 00:50:48,410
which could have been the cause of the 
erosion on the Sphinx.

1082
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:51,110
Now,
what has occurred,

1083
00:50:51,111 --> 00:50:55,820
knew what discoveries have been 
discovered in the last year.

1084
00:50:55,940 --> 00:51:00,200
Like what,
what is new that we can look at the,

1085
00:51:00,201 --> 00:51:02,960
in terms of archeology,
there's not much new,

1086
00:51:03,170 --> 00:51:03,911
um,
go back.

1087
00:51:03,911 --> 00:51:06,920
Lee Tempe at the moment is in deep 
freeze.

1088
00:51:07,010 --> 00:51:09,140
It's right 30 miles from the Syrian 
border.

1089
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:12,990
There's been massive unrest,
unrest in Shenandoah,

1090
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:13,993
which is the main town archeology is 
very difficult for them to carry on 

1091
00:51:18,261 --> 00:51:19,094
their space,
basically just frozen where they just 

1092
00:51:21,201 --> 00:51:23,270
sort of stopped.
They've just kind of stopped,

1093
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:24,230
you know,
and in fact,

1094
00:51:24,231 --> 00:51:26,390
there's amazing number of these of these
sites.

1095
00:51:26,391 --> 00:51:29,540
And other sites that I visited for 
magicians of the gods was Baalbek in the

1096
00:51:29,541 --> 00:51:30,110
Lebanon.

1097
00:51:30,110 --> 00:51:34,550
Absolutely stunning sight and again,
I'm convinced that that site is nuanced.

1098
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:35,810
It is,
yes,

1099
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:36,673
there is a rub temple there,
but they put that temple there because 

1100
00:51:39,081 --> 00:51:39,914
the site was sacred long before and 
there's this incredible u shaped 

1101
00:51:42,561 --> 00:51:43,394
megalithic wall which surrounds Baalbek,
which does not appear to have any 

1102
00:51:47,271 --> 00:51:49,880
connection to the,
to the Roman structure at at,

1103
00:51:49,881 --> 00:51:51,590
at all.
Again,

1104
00:51:51,770 --> 00:51:55,970
that's an area which is subject to 
tremendous unrest and difficult and it's

1105
00:51:55,971 --> 00:52:00,971
difficult for archaeologists to proceed,
but just just in 2014 they,

1106
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:06,380
they made a huge new discovery at 
Baalbek cover buried block,

1107
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:07,543
which weighs 1,460
tons which was sitting there on the 

1108
00:52:11,361 --> 00:52:12,194
site.
They've been working on that site for 

1109
00:52:13,001 --> 00:52:17,420
100 years.
They only found it in 2014 1000 tons.

1110
00:52:17,421 --> 00:52:18,890
What?
1,460

1111
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:20,900
times that 2 million pounds.
Is that what that is?

1112
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,033
I don't know.
Maybe it was math is better than mine 

1113
00:52:23,571 --> 00:52:24,650
and converting it into power

1114
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:28,540
2000 pounds,
2000 pounds to a,

1115
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:32,580
to a turn to an imperial ton,
so whatever,

1116
00:52:32,581 --> 00:52:36,300
and add three zeros on it,
doubled it and add three zeros on it.

1117
00:52:36,410 --> 00:52:38,590
It's a horrendous amount of pounds,
put it that way.

1118
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:42,140
It's the single largest block of stone 
ever cut and it in the ancient world.

1119
00:52:42,141 --> 00:52:42,974
And they found this just in 2014 found 
in 2014 now there's another big one 

1120
00:52:46,131 --> 00:52:46,964
right beside it,
which has been in plain view for about 

1121
00:52:49,850 --> 00:52:51,890
the last hundred years and it's 
astonishing to me that this one,

1122
00:52:51,891 --> 00:52:54,110
which is just below it was covered by 
sediment.

1123
00:52:54,390 --> 00:52:55,223
We have an actual calculator.
You might be the only person unless I 

1124
00:52:58,411 --> 00:53:01,050
never go anywhere without my calculator.
We'll calculator.

1125
00:53:01,530 --> 00:53:02,363
Nobody has one of those.
We were just talking about that 

1126
00:53:03,331 --> 00:53:04,590
yesterday.
We were like,

1127
00:53:04,591 --> 00:53:09,591
who the fuck is an actual guy can carry 
one.

1128
00:53:11,010 --> 00:53:14,810
Wow.
So Baalbek was also the site of a,

1129
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:15,653
I mean there,
there's many mountain model lists that 

1130
00:53:16,741 --> 00:53:17,574
have been discovered there and it's a 
really fascinating site that most many 

1131
00:53:19,350 --> 00:53:20,183
people have sort of overlooked.
When you talk about ancient structures 

1132
00:53:22,171 --> 00:53:24,660
in the past,
I have to resist.

1133
00:53:24,661 --> 00:53:26,100
I,
I've got nothing against

1134
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:30,090
aliens,
but I don't need aliens to explain these

1135
00:53:30,091 --> 00:53:31,070
things.
Um,

1136
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:32,353
I think a much,
a much leaner and more elegant 

1137
00:53:34,831 --> 00:53:35,664
explanation for these huge archeological
anomalies is a lost human civilization 

1138
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:40,013
much better.
That's been the case that I've been 

1139
00:53:41,011 --> 00:53:45,510
making for pr for 25 years.
I think that the alien thing is a bit of

1140
00:53:45,511 --> 00:53:47,160
a distraction for,
of course there's aliens.

1141
00:53:47,161 --> 00:53:47,994
Of course the universe is full of life,
but the ancient archeological sites are 

1142
00:53:51,841 --> 00:53:54,330
not good evidence for that idea that 
they're very,

1143
00:53:54,390 --> 00:53:56,730
unless you massage the evidence a lot,
they're not good evidence.

1144
00:53:56,750 --> 00:53:57,583
I think we are dealing with a lost human
civilization and at Baalbek 20 feet 

1145
00:54:00,901 --> 00:54:01,734
above the ground,
we have three blocks of stone joined so 

1146
00:54:04,711 --> 00:54:08,520
closely together that you can't get it 
edge of a sheet of paper between them.

1147
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:13,560
Each one weighs more than 900 tons and 
they are 20 feet above the ground.

1148
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:15,960
The stunning,
it's a stunning achievement.

1149
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:19,110
It's just absolutely astonishing.
How on earth did they do that?

1150
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:22,080
How does mainstream archeology deal with
that?

1151
00:54:22,110 --> 00:54:24,660
They say are the Romans built it all?
Oh the Romans.

1152
00:54:24,990 --> 00:54:27,750
The Romans did it.
The Romans did do some awesome stuff.

1153
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:30,330
They did do some awesome stuff.
They absolutely did.

1154
00:54:30,331 --> 00:54:32,610
But this site is separate from the Roman
site.

1155
00:54:32,611 --> 00:54:35,010
Its surrounds it,
but it's not part of it in my view.

1156
00:54:35,710 --> 00:54:36,543
In terms of your question,
what's happened within the last year or 

1157
00:54:38,111 --> 00:54:38,944
two,
I would think that probably the most 

1158
00:54:40,481 --> 00:54:41,314
significant thing or certainly right up 
there would be the the the comic 

1159
00:54:44,111 --> 00:54:44,944
research and the discovery.
I mean like this article I have right 

1160
00:54:47,351 --> 00:54:48,184
here,
which came out in 2014 so it's not that 

1161
00:54:50,381 --> 00:54:51,214
old.
A Nano diamond rich layer across three 

1162
00:54:55,181 --> 00:55:00,181
continents consistent with major cosmic 
impact at 12,800

1163
00:55:00,971 --> 00:55:05,971
years ago and it's something like 24 25 
highly pedigreed science

1164
00:55:07,390 --> 00:55:08,223
and these are the comic research group.
These are the scientists from the call 

1165
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:13,650
research group who have funded all their
research themselves.

1166
00:55:13,651 --> 00:55:16,770
They came out with another paper in 2015
where was this published?

1167
00:55:16,771 --> 00:55:18,900
If anybody wants to read this?
That's in the general of Glg.

1168
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:20,093
Yeah,
but then there's the proceedings of the 

1169
00:55:22,470 --> 00:55:24,330
National Academy of Sciences host a lot 
of their work as well,

1170
00:55:24,331 --> 00:55:27,330
and the proceedings of the National 
Academy of Sciences get into trouble for

1171
00:55:27,331 --> 00:55:28,164
hosting their work,
but they feel it's important so they 

1172
00:55:29,341 --> 00:55:32,790
keep on hosting it.
This is so spectacularly confusing to me

1173
00:55:32,791 --> 00:55:35,880
because that's rock solid science.
This is evidence.

1174
00:55:35,881 --> 00:55:37,410
This is actually,
you can weigh this stuff.

1175
00:55:37,411 --> 00:55:38,700
You can measure it.
You can,

1176
00:55:38,701 --> 00:55:41,730
you can run tests on it and find out 
what its components are.

1177
00:55:42,270 --> 00:55:43,770
This to me is so baffling.
Yeah,

1178
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:47,160
it's very baffling.
They brought out another paper in 2015 I

1179
00:55:47,161 --> 00:55:49,440
won't go into the some of the details 
that boring,

1180
00:55:49,441 --> 00:55:51,630
but it's called a Basey and 
chronological analysis.

1181
00:55:51,631 --> 00:55:54,060
And basically what they're,
what they were looking at is it,

1182
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:56,370
they ask themselves,
is it possible that this evidence,

1183
00:55:56,371 --> 00:55:58,080
these nano diamonds,
these melt glass,

1184
00:55:58,081 --> 00:55:58,914
that carbon's failures could that have 
been laid down gradually and the 

1185
00:56:02,191 --> 00:56:05,370
chronological analysis that they've done
absolutely answers that.

1186
00:56:05,371 --> 00:56:08,160
No,
it was not laid down gradually.

1187
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:11,460
This whole thing unfolded in a period of
about 24 hours.

1188
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:14,400
Whoa.
One at night.

1189
00:56:15,590 --> 00:56:17,150
Yeah.
And what had happened,

1190
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:17,984
Joe,
was that for years archeologists had 

1191
00:56:19,731 --> 00:56:24,731
recognized this a black matte layer at,
at about two dozen or more of the clovis

1192
00:56:28,691 --> 00:56:29,524
sites around North America,
which there had been over 50 of them 

1193
00:56:32,050 --> 00:56:32,883
that have been studied.
And it would see Vance Haynes who wrote 

1194
00:56:35,501 --> 00:56:37,840
an interesting paper saying that,
um,

1195
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:42,220
that he was the one who noted that below
this black matte layer,

1196
00:56:42,221 --> 00:56:45,430
which is only two to three inches thick 
in most sites,

1197
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:48,550
you found evidence of the clovis 
culture.

1198
00:56:48,551 --> 00:56:51,430
You found their tool kits in their,
their,

1199
00:56:51,431 --> 00:56:52,630
um,
spear points.

1200
00:56:52,631 --> 00:56:53,464
And so on.
You found evidence of the extinct 

1201
00:56:56,201 --> 00:56:58,570
megafauna,
but not above it.

1202
00:56:58,960 --> 00:56:59,793
You would find this evidence of this 
cultural activity and the megafauna 

1203
00:57:04,091 --> 00:57:06,490
right up to the bottom of the,
of the,

1204
00:57:06,491 --> 00:57:08,020
um,
black matte layer,

1205
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:12,520
but not above it.
So what finally happened was in 2007,

1206
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:13,593
um,
Richard firestone and Allen West and 

1207
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:16,893
some of their colleagues,
and it was just basically a small group 

1208
00:57:18,821 --> 00:57:21,400
at that point,
took a look at this closer look,

1209
00:57:21,730 --> 00:57:24,850
and that's when they began to discover 
these impact proxies,

1210
00:57:25,450 --> 00:57:27,430
usually right at the base of the layer.

1211
00:57:27,970 --> 00:57:32,230
And the layer itself is carbonaceous,
which suggests that there had been a lot

1212
00:57:32,231 --> 00:57:33,064
of sick deposited,
which would imply widespread wildfires 

1213
00:57:36,230 --> 00:57:37,063
factors.
A study off the right off the coast of 

1214
00:57:38,891 --> 00:57:39,724
California here on the Santa Rosa Island
is it pretty much concluded that there 

1215
00:57:43,091 --> 00:57:46,780
was just massive wildfires.
It pretty much just in Ila,

1216
00:57:46,781 --> 00:57:47,614
did everything.
And in this was proceeded by the 

1217
00:57:48,791 --> 00:57:49,624
deposition of this black matte layer.
And right at the bottom of this black 

1218
00:57:52,781 --> 00:57:54,850
matte layers where you find the nano 
diamonds,

1219
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:57,590
the magnetic grains,
the microspheres roles,

1220
00:57:57,830 --> 00:57:59,920
um,
the carbonaceous spherials.

1221
00:58:00,190 --> 00:58:02,050
Um,
fullerenes you,

1222
00:58:02,051 --> 00:58:05,380
you find these impact proxies and then 
are not all the same at all the sites.

1223
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:06,513
In fact,
that's been one of the things that the 

1224
00:58:07,181 --> 00:58:10,810
critics of seized upon,
but what they're doing is I think taking

1225
00:58:10,811 --> 00:58:14,950
an oversimplified model and when you 
look at a comic fragmentation event,

1226
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:16,113
you could be looking at the individual 
pieces could be have very different 

1227
00:58:19,511 --> 00:58:23,170
compositions and what we were talking 
about earlier,

1228
00:58:23,171 --> 00:58:24,370
the Taurid meteor stream.

1229
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:26,313
I'm not convinced at this point that it 
was necessarily just a single impact 

1230
00:58:28,931 --> 00:58:29,764
event.
It may have been a bombardment episode 

1231
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:36,010
that may have lasted even several 
decades.

1232
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:36,873
It may have been ceased for a while and 
we were talking about this last night 

1233
00:58:39,551 --> 00:58:44,551
over dinner that there seems to be a 
second spasm at 11,600

1234
00:58:44,861 --> 00:58:45,694
years ago.
That's also associated with a massive 

1235
00:58:48,311 --> 00:58:50,700
rise in sea level.
They call a,

1236
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:51,553
there's two meltwater spikes,
meltwater spike one a and meltwater 

1237
00:58:53,801 --> 00:58:57,260
spike one B.
I'm quite convinced that these meltwater

1238
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:01,810
spikes that have been documented by 
marine geologists and oceanographers are

1239
00:59:01,811 --> 00:59:02,644
correlated with these melting events of 
the ice sheet that I've been looking at 

1240
00:59:06,161 --> 00:59:08,030
in terms of their,
their geomorphic,

1241
00:59:08,510 --> 00:59:09,820
uh,
um,

1242
00:59:10,060 --> 00:59:12,820
consequences because some of these 
events,

1243
00:59:12,821 --> 00:59:13,654
I mean,
the only way I can describe some of 

1244
00:59:14,591 --> 00:59:15,424
these meltwater advances that the only 
modern analog to this would be a 

1245
00:59:18,671 --> 00:59:19,504
tsunami.

1246
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:24,200
And we've seen some pretty devastating 
tsunamis within the last decade or two.

1247
00:59:24,250 --> 00:59:26,630
Um,
both in Indonesia and in Japan.

1248
00:59:26,631 --> 00:59:28,160
And I don't know if you've ever seen any
of that,

1249
00:59:28,161 --> 00:59:31,490
like the videos of these tsunamis,
anybody listening,

1250
00:59:31,491 --> 00:59:32,324
it is definitely worthwhile to go online
and look at some of these videos where 

1251
00:59:35,421 --> 00:59:39,770
you can actually see the,
the unbelievably powerful effects of a,

1252
00:59:39,771 --> 00:59:43,670
of a 30 or 40 or 50 foot tsunami right 
now,

1253
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:45,290
some of the landscapes,
and I have a,

1254
00:59:45,291 --> 00:59:47,480
um,
some images we can pull up here shortly.

1255
00:59:48,030 --> 00:59:51,110
Um,
our places in Montana,

1256
00:59:51,410 --> 00:59:52,243
Idaho,
Washington where you literally had as 

1257
00:59:54,870 --> 00:59:55,703
tsunami sweeping over the land there was
over a thousand feet deep and that 

1258
01:00:00,231 --> 01:00:03,410
tsunami came off the ice cap.
And that that's not an oceanic tsunami.

1259
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:07,640
It's a freshwater tsunami.
It's meltwater coming off this,

1260
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:08,773
this catastrophic melting of the ice 
sheet and I've traced the sources of 

1261
01:00:12,471 --> 01:00:13,340
some of these meltwater.

1262
01:00:13,340 --> 01:00:14,173
I've made two trips now up into the end 
of the plateau country of British 

1263
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:18,013
Columbia looking for the source of this 
meltwater because in the conventional 

1264
01:00:21,801 --> 01:00:22,634
models now of the this flooding this 
that goes back to Harlan Brett's and 

1265
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:32,570
basically what they've done is they said
initially there could have been no flood

1266
01:00:32,571 --> 01:00:35,570
because Harlan Brett's didn't provide a 
source for the water.

1267
01:00:36,050 --> 01:00:37,340
They said,
the critics said,

1268
01:00:37,341 --> 01:00:38,174
well,
you're saying that all of this evidence 

1269
01:00:39,411 --> 01:00:41,210
in the landscape is evidence of the 
flood,

1270
01:00:41,211 --> 01:00:44,210
but what was the source of the flood?
And he didn't have a source.

1271
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:45,680
So the crane and said,
well,

1272
01:00:45,681 --> 01:00:47,210
you don't have a source for the 
floodwater.

1273
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:50,120
Therefore the flood didn't take place.
Then as,

1274
01:00:50,121 --> 01:00:50,954
as the research evolved,
you had independent evidence 

1275
01:00:55,730 --> 01:00:59,070
accumulating in western Montana by jt 
Pardee,

1276
01:00:59,090 --> 01:00:59,923
who was with the US Geological Survey 
and he was investigating evidence that 

1277
01:01:03,770 --> 01:01:04,603
the mountain valleys of western Montana 
had been filled up with an enormous 

1278
01:01:07,281 --> 01:01:08,240
volume of water.

1279
01:01:08,630 --> 01:01:09,463
And this volume of water seemed to be 
exactly the same time as Brett's is 

1280
01:01:13,491 --> 01:01:14,324
floods.
He then assumed that this was a giant 

1281
01:01:17,751 --> 01:01:19,800
lake.
And because you can see in,

1282
01:01:19,801 --> 01:01:21,800
and we can,
I think we have some images,

1283
01:01:21,801 --> 01:01:24,080
I think Jamie has some images,
so we'll pull them up shortly.

1284
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:26,660
We're on a mountain side,
you see to shorelines etched,

1285
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:28,910
you know,
a thousand feet above the valley floor.

1286
01:01:29,450 --> 01:01:34,100
And what he then decided was that based 
upon an old 19th century,

1287
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:35,073
uh,
interpretation by TC chamberlain that 

1288
01:01:37,161 --> 01:01:39,230
there had been an ice dam.
He said,

1289
01:01:39,231 --> 01:01:40,064
well,
there must have been an ice dam west of 

1290
01:01:41,151 --> 01:01:45,320
here somewhere in the Clark Fork Valley.
A giant lake backed up,

1291
01:01:45,620 --> 01:01:46,453
burst through the ice dam.
And then this is what would have caused 

1292
01:01:49,401 --> 01:01:50,870
Harlan.
Brett's is floods.

1293
01:01:51,170 --> 01:01:55,580
So now the geological community is 
shifting because number one,

1294
01:01:55,581 --> 01:02:00,050
the evidence is overwhelming and they 
can't deny it anymore.

1295
01:02:00,230 --> 01:02:01,063
But what they're doing is looking for a 
gradualist or a more uniformitarian 

1296
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:06,500
explanation.
So they immediately latched on to this.

1297
01:02:06,710 --> 01:02:07,543
Well,
there was a giant pro glacial or in 

1298
01:02:09,051 --> 01:02:11,090
front of a glacial lake,
uh,

1299
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:13,100
in western Montana.
Well,

1300
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:18,130
you're talking about somewhere between 
520 and 550 cubic miles of water.

1301
01:02:18,501 --> 01:02:21,030
That's a of water right in,
in,

1302
01:02:21,090 --> 01:02:22,980
in a,
normally when you have a large lake,

1303
01:02:23,010 --> 01:02:23,843
you have a huge catchment base and it is
feeding lots of streams and rivers that 

1304
01:02:27,331 --> 01:02:29,340
are feeding into that lake.
When you look at the,

1305
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:31,380
any of the big lakes around North 
America,

1306
01:02:31,950 --> 01:02:32,783
you have the lake and then you have this
big ole catchment basin and all of 

1307
01:02:35,281 --> 01:02:36,114
that's feeding in Lake Missoula.
The whole lake fills almost the whole 

1308
01:02:39,751 --> 01:02:41,610
catchment basin.
It's like,

1309
01:02:42,270 --> 01:02:43,860
to me what they did was they said,
okay,

1310
01:02:43,861 --> 01:02:47,790
we're just going to push the source of 
the water from here over to here,

1311
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:51,210
but let's not go into the question of 
where did the water come from?

1312
01:02:51,220 --> 01:02:54,030
That's filling these mountain valleys of
western Montana.

1313
01:02:54,750 --> 01:02:55,583
And this is what I had.
I spent a couple of weeks in September 

1314
01:02:59,310 --> 01:03:00,143
going up into some of these,
following these valleys up into British 

1315
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:06,480
Columbia.
And they're spectacular evidence.

1316
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:11,430
And it's almost like the American 
geologists stop at the,

1317
01:03:11,431 --> 01:03:13,260
at the 49th parallel,
and they say,

1318
01:03:13,261 --> 01:03:15,420
well,
that's the Canadians,

1319
01:03:15,820 --> 01:03:16,980
uh,
preserve up there.

1320
01:03:17,010 --> 01:03:19,110
We'll let them there.
They've got their own theories.

1321
01:03:19,111 --> 01:03:21,180
We've got ours.
Interestingly,

1322
01:03:21,181 --> 01:03:22,014
the Canadians are saying that we think 
that the water for these floods came 

1323
01:03:25,921 --> 01:03:30,060
from up here,
but they don't like that because you see

1324
01:03:30,090 --> 01:03:32,810
one of the leading geologists who,
who,

1325
01:03:32,870 --> 01:03:37,320
who's saying that these floods came from
from Canada is John Shaw,

1326
01:03:37,350 --> 01:03:39,410
who,
who basically came up.

1327
01:03:39,411 --> 01:03:40,244
There was this idea that drum Lynn's,
which are these inverted bolt hole 

1328
01:03:43,311 --> 01:03:47,130
shaped land forms,
they're found by hundreds of thousands,

1329
01:03:47,270 --> 01:03:48,750
uh,
in regions where,

1330
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:51,090
where glaciers were that they were 
formed,

1331
01:03:51,091 --> 01:03:53,880
not by the glaciers grinding over the 
landscape,

1332
01:03:53,881 --> 01:03:57,720
but they were actually formed by massive
subglacial flows of water.

1333
01:03:58,380 --> 01:04:01,200
And his critics have all been saying,
well,

1334
01:04:01,470 --> 01:04:04,230
here's the problem.
What's the source of your water?

1335
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:06,480
Therefore,
it wasn't water,

1336
01:04:06,481 --> 01:04:10,290
wasn't subglacial floods.
It's easy parallels that Harlan.

1337
01:04:10,291 --> 01:04:13,320
Brett's his story very closely.
Well,

1338
01:04:13,321 --> 01:04:15,060
here's the thing,
Sean,

1339
01:04:15,061 --> 01:04:18,810
his colleagues couldn't really come up 
with a plausible explanation for how you

1340
01:04:18,811 --> 01:04:21,950
could form these massive subglacial 
reservoirs.

1341
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:22,793
In fact,
what they call the living stone lake 

1342
01:04:24,091 --> 01:04:29,091
event required 84,000
cubic kilometers of water and I 84,000

1343
01:04:29,701 --> 01:04:32,070
kilometers.
I can do it really quickly here.

1344
01:04:32,350 --> 01:04:37,350
We would divide that by 30 36 that's 
about 2,300

1345
01:04:37,771 --> 01:04:38,604
cubic miles of water.
That's more than all of the Great Lakes 

1346
01:04:41,071 --> 01:04:41,904
combined,
vastly bigger than all of the Great 

1347
01:04:44,250 --> 01:04:45,083
Lakes combined.
It's probably every lake in North 

1348
01:04:46,201 --> 01:04:48,240
America combined,
and he said,

1349
01:04:48,241 --> 01:04:52,560
this one event required over 2000 cubic 
miles of water.

1350
01:04:53,070 --> 01:04:54,810
Well,
where did that water come from?

1351
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:56,580
So he basically said,
well,

1352
01:04:56,970 --> 01:04:57,803
there must have been a reservoir.
Somehow that formed his critics have 

1353
01:05:00,271 --> 01:05:01,740
said,
that's impossible.

1354
01:05:01,741 --> 01:05:05,400
You couldn't form that much water under 
the ice sheet.

1355
01:05:05,820 --> 01:05:06,653
Well,
what's happened now is the idea of a 

1356
01:05:08,731 --> 01:05:09,564
major cosmic impact into the ice sheet 
has completely obviated the need for a 

1357
01:05:14,461 --> 01:05:15,294
subglacial reservoir.
Because now we have a way of 

1358
01:05:17,621 --> 01:05:18,730
instantaneously

1359
01:05:18,730 --> 01:05:21,010
melting enormous volumes of,

1360
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:23,560
it's no longer a mystery where the water
came from.

1361
01:05:23,590 --> 01:05:24,423
It's fully explained,
and this has been the missing piece of 

1362
01:05:25,901 --> 01:05:26,734
the puzzle until the [inaudible] 
research group began to identify this 

1363
01:05:29,141 --> 01:05:29,974
evidence

1364
01:05:30,110 --> 01:05:30,943
baffling to me that this is a source of 
controversy because we know that the 

1365
01:05:33,231 --> 01:05:35,180
great lakes were created by melting 
glaciers.

1366
01:05:35,181 --> 01:05:36,014
We also know that there's vast areas of 
North America that are flattened by 

1367
01:05:39,411 --> 01:05:40,940
these glaciers.
You know,

1368
01:05:40,941 --> 01:05:42,710
a buddy of mine,
my friend Doug,

1369
01:05:42,711 --> 01:05:44,720
lives in Cazenovia,
Wisconsin,

1370
01:05:44,721 --> 01:05:46,340
which is what's called the driftless 
area,

1371
01:05:46,341 --> 01:05:48,560
where the,
the glaciers didn't go through.

1372
01:05:48,590 --> 01:05:50,160
I just was there,
uh,

1373
01:05:50,210 --> 01:05:51,800
in May.
It's beautiful.

1374
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:53,630
It's beautiful.
It's gorgeous gifts,

1375
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:55,490
rolling hills,
and it's just,

1376
01:05:55,491 --> 01:05:56,324
it wasn't,
it wasn't crushed flat like other parts 

1377
01:05:59,031 --> 01:06:00,470
of North America war.
Right?

1378
01:06:00,471 --> 01:06:01,304
So we know,
we know that those glaciers melted and 

1379
01:06:03,681 --> 01:06:04,930
they created the Great Lakes.
I mean,

1380
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:08,780
the Great Lakes were from glaciers.
We know that that's an established fact.

1381
01:06:09,020 --> 01:06:09,853
So why has all this confusing?
I just don't understand why they 

1382
01:06:11,421 --> 01:06:14,360
wouldn't just add that to it.
They just couldn't accept the great,

1383
01:06:14,361 --> 01:06:17,300
the glaciers.
Somehow or another in the last 10,000

1384
01:06:17,301 --> 01:06:18,134
years,
the glaciers just decided to stop 

1385
01:06:19,491 --> 01:06:20,324
smashing North America flat and melt and
create these great inland oceans of 

1386
01:06:24,081 --> 01:06:25,130
French water.
Yeah,

1387
01:06:25,310 --> 01:06:26,300
yeah.
Bizarre.

1388
01:06:26,490 --> 01:06:27,490
It's,
it's very bizarre.

1389
01:06:27,530 --> 01:06:29,800
Ultimately a lot,
a lot of ideology is,

1390
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:31,440
is involved in this.
There's,

1391
01:06:31,450 --> 01:06:33,510
there's um,
there's this design.

1392
01:06:33,530 --> 01:06:36,490
I also have been cut in the modern world
as a design not to panic.

1393
01:06:36,491 --> 01:06:38,050
The public,
not to say things that are,

1394
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:40,900
that are going to cause that are going 
to cause panic.

1395
01:06:40,901 --> 01:06:41,734
You know,

1396
01:06:42,190 --> 01:06:45,310
Donald Trump being president.
I think people are ready now.

1397
01:06:45,550 --> 01:06:48,130
I think people are ready for panic.
I think so.

1398
01:06:48,190 --> 01:06:49,960
Is there,
is anybody debated you on this,

1399
01:06:49,990 --> 01:06:50,980
either one of you on this?

1400
01:06:51,260 --> 01:06:51,711
Well,
you know,

1401
01:06:51,711 --> 01:06:53,990
I tried to them but not specifically on 
this.

1402
01:06:53,991 --> 01:06:54,824
I tried to do a debate with Zahi Hawass 
who was the guy who runs the Giza 

1403
01:06:57,471 --> 01:07:00,020
pyramids.
And then total total,

1404
01:07:00,021 --> 01:07:01,760
I mean,
very crazy event.

1405
01:07:01,790 --> 01:07:05,380
There's a video of it online.
Quite a a video of it online.

1406
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:07,170
Did they last what,
30 seconds?

1407
01:07:07,171 --> 01:07:08,710
It's something like something like that.
Yeah,

1408
01:07:08,750 --> 01:07:09,261
yeah,
yeah.

1409
01:07:09,261 --> 01:07:11,170
And then,
and then later on when he,

1410
01:07:11,330 --> 01:07:14,960
when he finally agreed to come back into
the room,

1411
01:07:14,961 --> 01:07:16,640
cause he was so angry with me,
walked out,

1412
01:07:16,641 --> 01:07:19,520
when he finally came back into the room,
he was asked a question about it.

1413
01:07:19,521 --> 01:07:22,130
Go back to the tippy and just like 
you're skeptic,

1414
01:07:22,131 --> 01:07:22,964
he didn't know anything about go back to
the technique or he claimed not to know 

1415
01:07:25,011 --> 01:07:25,721
about it.
I mean this is the,

1416
01:07:25,721 --> 01:07:26,554
this is supposed to be the world's most 
famous archaea Egyptologist and he knew 

1417
01:07:29,391 --> 01:07:31,670
nothing about this incredible sight in 
a,

1418
01:07:32,090 --> 01:07:33,020
in a neighboring country.

1419
01:07:33,260 --> 01:07:37,820
But one point to make the Randall was 
talking about the second event 11,600

1420
01:07:37,821 --> 01:07:39,350
years ago.
We're dealing with an with,

1421
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:42,950
with an episode of Cataclysm,
which begins 12,800

1422
01:07:42,951 --> 01:07:45,500
years ago,
an ends 11,600

1423
01:07:45,501 --> 01:07:46,334
years ago,
both episodes accompanied by massive 

1424
01:07:49,341 --> 01:07:52,380
floods and the 11,600
years ago data,

1425
01:07:52,381 --> 01:07:54,050
I may have mentioned this last year,
it's in,

1426
01:07:54,051 --> 01:07:57,260
it's in magicians of the gods.
What's interesting about that is that is

1427
01:07:57,261 --> 01:08:02,150
the exact date that plato gives us for 
the destruction of the lost civilization

1428
01:08:02,151 --> 01:08:03,710
of Atlantis.
Plato.

1429
01:08:03,950 --> 01:08:06,170
That's the only source we have for 
Atlantis.

1430
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:07,033
It comes to us.
Many people think it's all over the 

1431
01:08:08,061 --> 01:08:08,930
place,
but it's not.

1432
01:08:09,290 --> 01:08:11,780
Atlantis comes to us from the Greek 
philosopher Plato,

1433
01:08:12,020 --> 01:08:12,853
who lived around 340 BC and he got the 
story from through his family line from 

1434
01:08:18,141 --> 01:08:23,141
his ancestors so long who had visited 
Egypt in 600 BC and they're sold on,

1435
01:08:23,631 --> 01:08:26,720
was told of a great civilization that 
had existed on earth.

1436
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:28,940
That was the progenitor civilization of 
Egypt.

1437
01:08:29,210 --> 01:08:32,120
But that was destroyed in a terrible 
cataclysm.

1438
01:08:32,450 --> 01:08:33,283
And he asked at a cataclysm involving a 
gigantic flood and Atlantis was 

1439
01:08:37,191 --> 01:08:39,660
submerged beneath the waves and was 
never seen again.

1440
01:08:39,661 --> 01:08:42,290
And so solid said to the priest,
when did this happen?

1441
01:08:42,890 --> 01:08:46,550
And they said three to 9,000
years ago,

1442
01:08:46,730 --> 01:08:49,610
that was in 600 BC.
So that's 9,600

1443
01:08:49,611 --> 01:08:51,230
BC,
that's 11,600

1444
01:08:51,231 --> 01:08:52,730
years ago.
That's meltwater pulse.

1445
01:08:52,731 --> 01:08:54,080
One B.
How could they know?

1446
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:55,353
You know,
how could we have to start taking this 

1447
01:08:56,361 --> 01:08:57,194
stuff more seriously instead of sneering
attitude and skepta sizing it out of 

1448
01:09:00,321 --> 01:09:01,154
existence?
We need to leave a little bit of room 

1449
01:09:02,841 --> 01:09:05,360
for extraordinary ideas possibly being 
right.

1450
01:09:05,361 --> 01:09:06,194
That's the main beef I have with the 
skeptics is that they want to throw the 

1451
01:09:08,241 --> 01:09:09,370
baby out with the bath water.
Okay,

1452
01:09:09,420 --> 01:09:10,920
I want to add something to that.
In,

1453
01:09:10,921 --> 01:09:12,350
in the tomatoes,
you know,

1454
01:09:12,750 --> 01:09:17,190
Plato Discusses Atlantis in two 
dialogues and into tomatoes.

1455
01:09:17,220 --> 01:09:21,950
He prefaces the story of Atlantis by 
recounting the myth of fate.

1456
01:09:22,470 --> 01:09:25,170
Now the myth of Fayton is a very 
interesting story.

1457
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:26,033
And basically what it is,
is Fayton was the offspring of Haley 

1458
01:09:29,701 --> 01:09:30,534
owes the sun.
God who was raised didn't know who his 

1459
01:09:32,881 --> 01:09:35,730
father was.
His mother kept it a secret from him.

1460
01:09:35,731 --> 01:09:36,564
And then one day he was being taunted at
school because all of his school mates 

1461
01:09:39,301 --> 01:09:40,510
had,
you know,

1462
01:09:40,890 --> 01:09:43,260
recounting the great deeds of their 
fathers and everything.

1463
01:09:43,261 --> 01:09:45,300
So he went home distraught and finally 
his mother said,

1464
01:09:45,301 --> 01:09:48,720
well actually your father is the,
the big granddaddy of them all.

1465
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:49,913
Haley owes the Sun God.
So Fayton decides he's going to go and 

1466
01:09:53,401 --> 01:09:54,234
find his father and eventually does and 
he goes to some celestial realm or his 

1467
01:10:00,751 --> 01:10:01,890
father is located.

1468
01:10:01,890 --> 01:10:05,010
And the way it is with the,
with the,

1469
01:10:05,030 --> 01:10:05,863
with the,
the Greek gods they have on limited 

1470
01:10:08,281 --> 01:10:10,470
powers except they also have certain 
restrictions.

1471
01:10:10,471 --> 01:10:13,020
For example,
if a god makes a promise,

1472
01:10:13,290 --> 01:10:15,450
he,
he or she cannot go back on it,

1473
01:10:15,510 --> 01:10:17,540
right?
So when Haley,

1474
01:10:17,541 --> 01:10:19,950
Oh sees fate and his,
his lost son come,

1475
01:10:19,951 --> 01:10:21,060
he's sober joy,
he says,

1476
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:21,953
I'm so happy to see you.
I will grant you any boone you want and 

1477
01:10:24,811 --> 01:10:27,960
fate and says,
I want to drive the chariot to the sun.

1478
01:10:27,990 --> 01:10:31,450
I want to drive your chariot.
And Haley,

1479
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:32,293
oh says,
well I meant anything you wanted to 

1480
01:10:34,311 --> 01:10:36,060
accept that,
you know,

1481
01:10:36,330 --> 01:10:38,580
so it goes back and forth and back and 
forth.

1482
01:10:38,581 --> 01:10:42,750
Finally Phaeton convinces his father,
let him let me do it.

1483
01:10:42,751 --> 01:10:43,561
His father says,
look,

1484
01:10:43,561 --> 01:10:44,394
you've got to hang onto those reins 
tight cause those steeds are going to 

1485
01:10:46,101 --> 01:10:46,934
pull away from you.

1486
01:10:48,420 --> 01:10:50,610
He gets in there at the gates of the sun
open.

1487
01:10:50,910 --> 01:10:53,780
It describes in the myth you can go,
you know,

1488
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:56,460
you can read edith with Hamilton or 
bulfinch or any of the,

1489
01:10:56,510 --> 01:10:57,343
the,
the great retellings of the Greek myths 

1490
01:10:58,831 --> 01:10:59,664
and they'll describe it in there.
It goes through the signs of the Zodiac 

1491
01:11:02,671 --> 01:11:05,490
and then all of a sudden it careens off 
and heads down to earth.

1492
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:08,010
And then it describes his whole litany 
of catastrophes.

1493
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:11,850
This setting the earth on fire.
And finally the,

1494
01:11:11,910 --> 01:11:13,350
uh,
Jupiter,

1495
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:14,080
uh,
at,

1496
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:14,913
at the,
uh,

1497
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:19,140
at the beseeching of Poseidon and who's 
afraid that the oceans are going to boil

1498
01:11:19,141 --> 01:11:21,480
away,
gets Zeus to mount his,

1499
01:11:21,510 --> 01:11:22,530
his,
uh,

1500
01:11:22,890 --> 01:11:23,723
Mount Olympus and hurl his thunderbolt,
which knocks Fayton from the sky and he 

1501
01:11:27,511 --> 01:11:28,970
falls to Earth in,
in,

1502
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:29,833
in falls into the river Eridanus which 
is a metaphor for the a Milky Way and 

1503
01:11:34,621 --> 01:11:39,540
his sisters the hell yachty's then a 
weep over the death of their brother and

1504
01:11:39,541 --> 01:11:43,320
their tears fall to earth and caused the
great flood plato.

1505
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:47,280
Then after re referencing that myth,
he then says,

1506
01:11:47,281 --> 01:11:48,114
now this has the form of a myth,
but what it really represents is a 

1507
01:11:51,901 --> 01:11:52,734
declaration or a declining of the bodies
in space orbiting around the earth and 

1508
01:11:57,121 --> 01:11:57,954
an eventual falling to earth of one of 
those bodies and a conflagration of all 

1509
01:12:01,531 --> 01:12:04,230
things triggered by the fall of that 
body.

1510
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,650
It's intriguing that he mentioned the 
Zodiac because you know,

1511
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:07,493
cause the Taurid meteor stream is so 
cold because it appears to come at us 

1512
01:12:10,830 --> 01:12:14,310
from the direction of the constellation 
of Tourist Zodiacal constellation.

1513
01:12:14,790 --> 01:12:15,623
That's where those shooting stars 
amongst which has some very large 

1514
01:12:18,541 --> 01:12:20,760
objects that,
that have hit us in the past and can hit

1515
01:12:20,761 --> 01:12:22,590
us again in the future.
That's where they come from.

1516
01:12:22,591 --> 01:12:26,760
They come from that area of the sky.
It's an actual human illusion.

1517
01:12:26,761 --> 01:12:27,594
It appears that they're,
they're not actually coming from 

1518
01:12:29,131 --> 01:12:29,610
tourists.

1519
01:12:29,610 --> 01:12:31,890
It looks like that they come from that 
area of the sky.

1520
01:12:32,020 --> 01:12:32,853
They come from that area of the sky.
And so anybody in in ancient times who 

1521
01:12:36,301 --> 01:12:41,220
was witnessing and according to the 
Victor Club and William Napier and those

1522
01:12:41,221 --> 01:12:42,054
guys who are the British new 
catastrophists that had been doing all 

1523
01:12:43,831 --> 01:12:48,831
of this work for decades on the Taurid 
meteor shower have concluded that,

1524
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:53,070
you know,
in times past it was an extremely active

1525
01:12:53,071 --> 01:12:57,090
shower and would have created some 
pretty darn impressive light shows,

1526
01:12:57,390 --> 01:12:58,223
uh,
even if it wasn't causing catastrophes 

1527
01:13:00,481 --> 01:13:01,800
down here below.
But what they've,

1528
01:13:02,070 --> 01:13:02,903
what they've conjectured is that there 
might be times of multiple tongue goose 

1529
01:13:05,861 --> 01:13:10,230
go like impact bombardment when um,
you know,

1530
01:13:10,231 --> 01:13:11,064
there could be,
cause there could be thousands of 

1531
01:13:12,451 --> 01:13:13,284
objects within the tarred meteor stream 
on the same scale as the tin goose got 

1532
01:13:16,431 --> 01:13:18,250
object.
And that if,

1533
01:13:18,580 --> 01:13:19,413
if you go and you read the accounts,
the eyewitness accounts over and over 

1534
01:13:21,781 --> 01:13:23,400
again,
people are saying things like,

1535
01:13:23,401 --> 01:13:26,100
well it looked like it was being 
disgorged from the sun.

1536
01:13:26,490 --> 01:13:28,590
It looked like it was being born out of 
the sun.

1537
01:13:28,620 --> 01:13:31,380
Right.
It looked like a second son in the sky.

1538
01:13:31,410 --> 01:13:34,200
Like for a short period of time,
the son had a twin,

1539
01:13:34,201 --> 01:13:35,220
right?
Well,

1540
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:36,113
the summertime cards are coming from 
their para helion passage around the 

1541
01:13:39,661 --> 01:13:40,494
sun.
So you like green was saying they make 

1542
01:13:41,941 --> 01:13:46,230
an elliptical orbit out to Jupiter and 
back around the sun in this stream,

1543
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:47,093
right.
Earth crosses that stream twice each 

1544
01:13:49,231 --> 01:13:50,790
year.
One time,

1545
01:13:50,820 --> 01:13:52,470
late June,
early July,

1546
01:13:52,740 --> 01:13:53,573
we crossed.
But at that point they're coming from 

1547
01:13:54,901 --> 01:13:57,330
the direction of the sun.
So they're,

1548
01:13:57,340 --> 01:13:58,173
their arrival to earth is going to be 
very difficult to see because they're 

1549
01:14:01,140 --> 01:14:03,150
coming from the direction of the sun.
Right.

1550
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:07,800
But that's exactly where on June 30th 
the Taurid meteor would be coming from.

1551
01:14:08,210 --> 01:14:09,043
Um,
and then also the fact that it's the 

1552
01:14:10,741 --> 01:14:13,420
perfect date for the peak of the,
of the shower and the,

1553
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:14,273
the correct place in the sky to me is 
pretty convincing evidence that it was 

1554
01:14:18,161 --> 01:14:21,670
most likely a remnant of that towards 
stream.

1555
01:14:22,090 --> 01:14:25,120
The other time that the earth crosses 
his late October,

1556
01:14:25,121 --> 01:14:26,230
early November,
in fact,

1557
01:14:26,231 --> 01:14:27,730
we've just passed out of it,
um,

1558
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:31,810
within the last week basically.
But it peaks interestingly,

1559
01:14:31,870 --> 01:14:32,703
coincidentally,
between like October 30th and November 

1560
01:14:36,070 --> 01:14:36,903
4th or fifth,
so it's peaking right around Halloween 

1561
01:14:39,101 --> 01:14:40,270
time.
In fact,

1562
01:14:40,271 --> 01:14:42,790
they've been called the Halloween 
meteors and there's some very,

1563
01:14:43,380 --> 01:14:45,700
sometimes they call them the Halloween 
fireworks.

1564
01:14:45,701 --> 01:14:46,534
Yeah.
But there's some very interesting work 

1565
01:14:48,011 --> 01:14:49,000
done by a,
um,

1566
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:50,353
a researcher background,
early 20th century named Grant 

1567
01:14:53,260 --> 01:14:57,760
Halliburton,
who spent about 15 years researching the

1568
01:14:57,820 --> 01:15:01,720
connections between ancient calendars.
And he concluded,

1569
01:15:01,721 --> 01:15:02,554
one thing very interesting was that lot 
of these ancient calendars where being 

1570
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:10,630
synchronized by people's observations of
the rise and fall of the pleiades,

1571
01:15:10,660 --> 01:15:13,990
which is the shoulder of the bowl,
the pleiades comprises,

1572
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:16,540
uh,
basically part of that,

1573
01:15:16,860 --> 01:15:18,900
uh,
constellations all tourists.

1574
01:15:19,110 --> 01:15:20,530
Yeah.
The shoulder of the bull.

1575
01:15:20,980 --> 01:15:24,670
And what he came up with was that in his
research,

1576
01:15:24,671 --> 01:15:29,230
he discovered that many of these stories
that were associated with this,

1577
01:15:29,231 --> 01:15:31,840
like the slaying of the celestial bull,
you know,

1578
01:15:32,170 --> 01:15:36,940
Gilgamesh and thank do into,
and the earliest known a story,

1579
01:15:36,941 --> 01:15:38,840
they,
they fight the celestial bowl.

1580
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:41,500
There's many counterparts and variants 
of that in,

1581
01:15:41,501 --> 01:15:43,060
in,
in mythical stories.

1582
01:15:43,510 --> 01:15:47,140
Um,
and so what he then found out though was

1583
01:15:47,141 --> 01:15:49,450
that in many cases,
the,

1584
01:15:49,660 --> 01:15:50,493
that,
that our modern halloween actually goes 

1585
01:15:52,271 --> 01:15:53,104
back thousands of years to an ancient 
day of the dead that was observed all 

1586
01:15:57,671 --> 01:16:00,430
over the earth at the same time every 
year,

1587
01:16:00,431 --> 01:16:03,630
even in the southern hemisphere.
And it usually revolves,

1588
01:16:03,940 --> 01:16:07,720
revolved around a commemoration of the,
the culmination of the pleiades,

1589
01:16:07,721 --> 01:16:11,080
which is when the pleiades crosses the 
local meridian.

1590
01:16:11,081 --> 01:16:11,770
Another words,
it,

1591
01:16:11,770 --> 01:16:14,260
it reaches the key stone of the Royal 
Arch,

1592
01:16:14,261 --> 01:16:16,060
so to speak,
up in the sky.

1593
01:16:16,061 --> 01:16:16,894
So if you got an eye on Halloween now 
and you face the south in the northern 

1594
01:16:19,571 --> 01:16:20,404
hemisphere,
you will see the pleiades right at 

1595
01:16:22,150 --> 01:16:24,400
midnight,
at midnight,

1596
01:16:24,401 --> 01:16:25,940
they will be,
if you think of the,

1597
01:16:25,990 --> 01:16:28,270
the,
the arch of the Zodiac as being,

1598
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:28,980
uh,
a,

1599
01:16:28,980 --> 01:16:29,920
uh,
a,

1600
01:16:29,921 --> 01:16:31,270
um,
like a clock.

1601
01:16:31,330 --> 01:16:33,190
It's right there at midnight,
at midnight.

1602
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:34,091
Right?
Well,

1603
01:16:34,091 --> 01:16:37,420
here's the interesting link is that in 
all of these myths,

1604
01:16:37,570 --> 01:16:38,403
what Halliburton discovered over and 
over again was that the day of the dead 

1605
01:16:42,460 --> 01:16:43,293
ultimately went back to myths about,
of the destruction of the world by a 

1606
01:16:47,711 --> 01:16:49,660
great flood and,
or fire.

1607
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:53,470
It's fascinating that it's all coming 
out of the Constellation tourists too,

1608
01:16:53,471 --> 01:16:54,304
and it's the celestial bowl that they're
fighting in these ancient myths and all 

1609
01:16:57,761 --> 01:16:58,594
these cultures around the world are 
celebrating the day of the dead have 

1610
01:17:01,511 --> 01:17:02,344
this exact same time.
This is amazing stuff and right now our 

1611
01:17:04,930 --> 01:17:09,500
science is closing its eyes to this.
I think it's fair to say with the Taurid

1612
01:17:09,501 --> 01:17:10,370
meteor stream,

1613
01:17:10,430 --> 01:17:11,263
which is a very big issue in this whole 
discussion that we are dealing with the 

1614
01:17:14,241 --> 01:17:15,074
hidden hand in human history.
It's something that is going to 

1615
01:17:17,210 --> 01:17:20,630
ultimately require us to reexplain 
almost everything,

1616
01:17:20,631 --> 01:17:21,464
but the skeptics hate it.
They can't bear it because first of all 

1617
01:17:25,910 --> 01:17:26,743
it involves cataclysms and secondly it 
involves the possibility of losing a 

1618
01:17:30,651 --> 01:17:33,080
whole civilization from the record.
It's really,

1619
01:17:33,350 --> 01:17:37,190
it's really interesting when you look at
the dates of the this cluster,

1620
01:17:37,220 --> 01:17:41,300
this episode of bombardment between 
twelve thousand eight hundred and eleven

1621
01:17:41,300 --> 01:17:42,133
thousand six hundred years ago.
That's the period that just immediately 

1622
01:17:44,271 --> 01:17:45,104
precedes what mainstream academia think 
of as the very beginnings of 

1623
01:17:49,250 --> 01:17:53,840
civilization and they've just never the,
maybe it's not even their fault,

1624
01:17:53,870 --> 01:17:54,703
it's this is so recent.
This science is so new that they've not 

1625
01:17:58,101 --> 01:17:58,934
had time to adapt to it,
but if they adapt to it and take this 

1626
01:18:01,071 --> 01:18:01,904
into account,
then suddenly what was an extraordinary 

1627
01:18:04,161 --> 01:18:09,050
and absurd and impossible idea that 
there was a lost civilization 12,000

1628
01:18:09,051 --> 01:18:09,884
years ago becomes a very plausible and 
reasonable idea and then we start once 

1629
01:18:13,191 --> 01:18:13,550
we can.

1630
01:18:13,550 --> 01:18:14,383
Once we take that on board,
then we can start opening our eyes to 

1631
01:18:17,770 --> 01:18:20,600
archeological anomalies like the Great 
Sphinx,

1632
01:18:20,601 --> 01:18:21,434
like Baalbek likes submerged ruins like 
go Beckley tappy and begin to consider 

1633
01:18:26,151 --> 01:18:30,890
what does all this mean?
Are we in fact a species with Amnesia?

1634
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:33,980
Are we here forgetful of the truth about
ourselves?

1635
01:18:33,981 --> 01:18:36,230
Maybe that's why we're so fucked up,
you know,

1636
01:18:36,231 --> 01:18:37,064
because we just actually don't know.
We've made up a story about where we 

1637
01:18:39,591 --> 01:18:42,320
came from and what we are.
I certainly think it plays a part.

1638
01:18:42,450 --> 01:18:43,283
I also think that conservative 
skepticism is probably prudent when 

1639
01:18:45,681 --> 01:18:49,280
you're dealing with most scientific,
most things that come up that people are

1640
01:18:49,281 --> 01:18:50,114
claiming.
I mean there's so many charlatans out 

1641
01:18:51,831 --> 01:18:54,620
there and crazy people that are claiming
new discoveries,

1642
01:18:54,950 --> 01:18:58,020
but in some cases they examine these 
discoveries.

1643
01:18:58,021 --> 01:18:58,854
Is as long as they're far enough away 
from us or weird enough like this new 

1644
01:19:02,751 --> 01:19:05,930
planet that they believe their,
they have a 90 plan sign.

1645
01:19:05,940 --> 01:19:06,773
Yeah,
yeah.

1646
01:19:07,130 --> 01:19:09,190
They're pretty sure there's something 
out there.

1647
01:19:09,191 --> 01:19:11,900
I'd passed the Kuyper belt and they 
think it's massive.

1648
01:19:11,901 --> 01:19:12,734
They think it's at least four times,
maybe larger than the United States or 

1649
01:19:16,641 --> 01:19:17,211
then,
excuse me,

1650
01:19:17,211 --> 01:19:19,730
the world and the world and got to know 
a bit of about 10,000

1651
01:19:19,731 --> 01:19:23,930
years and that's interesting with 
comments because this huge,

1652
01:19:23,931 --> 01:19:28,250
massive object circulating in the outer 
solar system through the Kuiper belt,

1653
01:19:28,251 --> 01:19:29,084
which is a source of many of the 
comments that hit the earth is 

1654
01:19:31,251 --> 01:19:32,084
destabilizing comments from safe orbits 
and putting them into really dangerous 

1655
01:19:35,811 --> 01:19:38,360
or bits that come our way that correctly
if I'm wrong,

1656
01:19:38,361 --> 01:19:39,194
but like what?
What is the source of all these near 

1657
01:19:40,761 --> 01:19:41,594
Earth objects?
Is this have anything to do with Earth 

1658
01:19:43,311 --> 01:19:44,144
One and earth to,
does it have anything to do with the 

1659
01:19:45,381 --> 01:19:46,214
initial impact that created the moon?
Is that because we were hit by another 

1660
01:19:49,641 --> 01:19:51,830
planet,
right during the formation of the earth,

1661
01:19:52,100 --> 01:19:54,320
and this is all scientifically 
established.

1662
01:19:54,650 --> 01:19:57,770
Astro scientists or astrophysicist 
rather,

1663
01:19:58,040 --> 01:20:00,440
and a astronomers all agree on that,
right?

1664
01:20:00,441 --> 01:20:01,274
There's a lot of debris.
The would would go back to that to that 

1665
01:20:03,921 --> 01:20:04,754
time,
but comments are another story because 

1666
01:20:06,561 --> 01:20:09,030
they're coming in from the far reaches 
of outer space.

1667
01:20:09,031 --> 01:20:09,864
They are coming,
they're coming in from the oort cloud 

1668
01:20:11,551 --> 01:20:14,300
and the coin just vast distances away 
there.

1669
01:20:14,540 --> 01:20:15,373
Their voyagers,
they're kind of messages from the 

1670
01:20:16,891 --> 01:20:17,724
distant reaches of the cosmos,
who come in in an unpredictable way 

1671
01:20:20,371 --> 01:20:21,204
because they're all bits are 
destabilized by something like planet 

1672
01:20:24,091 --> 01:20:24,924
nine.
Isn't there something called bodes law 

1673
01:20:26,201 --> 01:20:27,210
where you,
uh,

1674
01:20:27,270 --> 01:20:28,103
you can measure the mass and the orbit 
of a certain planet and you can 

1675
01:20:30,481 --> 01:20:31,314
accurately depict where the next planet 
is going to be and doesn't that fall 

1676
01:20:33,511 --> 01:20:35,280
apart somewhere between Mars and 
Jupiter,

1677
01:20:35,300 --> 01:20:37,010
this asteroid belt?
Yeah.

1678
01:20:37,290 --> 01:20:38,123
Which,
which would indicate that something was 

1679
01:20:38,941 --> 01:20:39,774
probably there.

1680
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:41,550
That's why the theory of the asteroid 
belt,

1681
01:20:41,551 --> 01:20:43,110
that it wasn't exploded planet.
Of course,

1682
01:20:43,111 --> 01:20:44,970
there's a lot of opposition to that 
theory too.

1683
01:20:45,210 --> 01:20:46,170
You know,
you're right.

1684
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:49,680
Skepticism really has an important role 
to play.

1685
01:20:49,810 --> 01:20:50,641
It's,
it's very,

1686
01:20:50,641 --> 01:20:51,474
it's really,
it's really essential that we are 

1687
01:20:52,801 --> 01:20:53,634
skeptical and otherwise we'd all be 
found Zacharias itching and waiting for 

1688
01:20:56,221 --> 01:20:59,400
the Annunaki to land.
Exactly what the solar houses.

1689
01:20:59,401 --> 01:21:01,860
December 21st,
2012 we'd all be going,

1690
01:21:01,861 --> 01:21:02,694
what the fuck?
Now I'm homeless four years later and I 

1691
01:21:04,651 --> 01:21:05,484
have to say there's a skeptic called 
Michael Heizer who has done really an 

1692
01:21:08,100 --> 01:21:10,800
excellent job of,
of thoroughly,

1693
01:21:10,850 --> 01:21:11,683
you know,
debunking the bogus translations of 

1694
01:21:13,450 --> 01:21:14,530
Zachariah stitching.
Is,

1695
01:21:14,580 --> 01:21:17,180
is such an as wrong.com
is that section is wrong.com.

1696
01:21:17,370 --> 01:21:19,890
It's a very useful,
it's a very useful site.

1697
01:21:19,891 --> 01:21:21,820
So we hated him and loved him at the 
same time.

1698
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:22,830
So,
so sad.

1699
01:21:22,831 --> 01:21:23,664
I love the idea of the aliens come down 
and manipulating the monkeys and making 

1700
01:21:27,190 --> 01:21:28,440
us to mine gold.

1701
01:21:28,470 --> 01:21:31,050
It's a wonderful story,
but unfortunately it's a work of science

1702
01:21:31,051 --> 01:21:32,430
fiction.
There's not a work of fact.

1703
01:21:32,850 --> 01:21:35,250
Zachariah we need,
I knew him.

1704
01:21:35,251 --> 01:21:36,084
He was a fascinating man.
I once drove him from stonehenge to 

1705
01:21:37,861 --> 01:21:38,520
London.
We had,

1706
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:41,580
we had many conversations.
He was a deep and serious researcher,

1707
01:21:41,581 --> 01:21:43,920
but I think he,
I think he got,

1708
01:21:43,980 --> 01:21:44,813
he got carried away with his own fat.
I also think that that fantasy became 

1709
01:21:48,031 --> 01:21:51,810
very lucrative and it also became a 
source of identity to him.

1710
01:21:52,180 --> 01:21:54,090
And I followed him pretty closely as 
well.

1711
01:21:54,091 --> 01:21:56,040
I've read the 12th Planet and,
uh,

1712
01:21:56,060 --> 01:21:56,893
I got really into his research and this 
is in my early pot smoking days when I 

1713
01:22:00,571 --> 01:22:02,130
first started smoking pot.
So I was,

1714
01:22:02,610 --> 01:22:05,400
I was all in,
I was all in.

1715
01:22:05,580 --> 01:22:10,580
And then as I got wiser and then as I 
got mine on this maybe not wiser,

1716
01:22:11,550 --> 01:22:15,060
I started recognizing objectively why 
these,

1717
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:16,320
these things are so attractive.

1718
01:22:16,470 --> 01:22:19,530
The fantastical is more attractive than 
the practical.

1719
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:22,230
And so something else,
again,

1720
01:22:22,231 --> 01:22:24,010
I don't want to,
I don't want to put in down and I'm,

1721
01:22:24,011 --> 01:22:27,090
I'm here also to say that and did a lot 
of really good work.

1722
01:22:27,091 --> 01:22:27,924
He was at,
he's a clever guy and he did a lot of 

1723
01:22:28,801 --> 01:22:29,521
very,
very,

1724
01:22:29,521 --> 01:22:32,000
very thorough research.
Um,

1725
01:22:32,010 --> 01:22:33,750
I've just lost my track actually smoking
too much.

1726
01:22:33,751 --> 01:22:34,740
Dope.
Where was I going?

1727
01:22:35,050 --> 01:22:36,510
Ah,
well we were talking about,

1728
01:22:36,540 --> 01:22:37,590
um,
the,

1729
01:22:37,710 --> 01:22:38,543
all the,
the difference between the fantastical 

1730
01:22:39,721 --> 01:22:40,554
and the practical,
that there's this inclination to accept 

1731
01:22:43,950 --> 01:22:45,670
things that are fun.
Yeah.

1732
01:22:45,860 --> 01:22:46,693
You know,
that's where I was going to say is that 

1733
01:22:47,821 --> 01:22:49,770
when you start talking about the 
Annunaki,

1734
01:22:49,771 --> 01:22:53,430
those from heaven to earth came these 
fantastic creatures from,

1735
01:22:53,431 --> 01:22:54,264
thank you.
You've brought my memory in the Arrow 

1736
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:56,700
thing.
I remembered what I was going to say.

1737
01:22:57,150 --> 01:23:00,150
What's interesting in part because I 
know it kind of wants could be good.

1738
01:23:00,390 --> 01:23:01,320
What was,
um,

1739
01:23:01,350 --> 01:23:02,183
what's,
what's interesting is that the level of 

1740
01:23:03,841 --> 01:23:06,400
technology that's attributes

1741
01:23:06,430 --> 01:23:07,263
to the Anu Nakia bleak Nephilim,
that that level of technology is the 

1742
01:23:11,231 --> 01:23:15,460
level of technology that we had in the 
1970s when we were,

1743
01:23:15,730 --> 01:23:16,541
um,
you know,

1744
01:23:16,541 --> 01:23:17,374
Nasa was doing its stuff.
So it's NASA technology from the 1970s 

1745
01:23:20,231 --> 01:23:24,970
that is projected out onto,
that is projected over the ground,

1746
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:29,500
but it's projected out that is projected
out onto his theory of the past.

1747
01:23:29,501 --> 01:23:30,334
Now,
it seems to me very unlikely that the 

1748
01:23:31,691 --> 01:23:35,440
Nefa limb or the Anunnaki would have had
for 400,000

1749
01:23:35,441 --> 01:23:36,760
years,
which is what he's saying,

1750
01:23:37,030 --> 01:23:37,863
the same technology that NASA had in the
1970s as much more likely that he's 

1751
01:23:40,841 --> 01:23:41,674
projecting that onto the data rather 
than that it's actually inherent in the 

1752
01:23:44,711 --> 01:23:44,960
dark.

1753
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:45,793
There was also some interesting ideas 
that he had that turned out to be ideas 

1754
01:23:49,131 --> 01:23:52,940
that scientists had also proposed about 
preserving our atmosphere by,

1755
01:23:53,510 --> 01:23:58,510
by levitating or by suspending 
reflective particles in our atmosphere.

1756
01:23:58,790 --> 01:24:02,930
And that that is something that the 
Annunaki in his books we're going to use

1757
01:24:02,931 --> 01:24:05,540
gold for because gold has such unique 
properties,

1758
01:24:05,780 --> 01:24:08,270
which is why they use gold to plate 
things.

1759
01:24:08,420 --> 01:24:10,070
Cause you can take a little tiny piece 
of gold.

1760
01:24:10,071 --> 01:24:14,960
You could play this entire table goals.
Really spectacular piece of,

1761
01:24:14,961 --> 01:24:16,320
uh,
I mean it's just,

1762
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:17,780
there's nothing like it,
right?

1763
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:21,730
Absolutely.
There's a lot of really good material in

1764
01:24:21,731 --> 01:24:22,564
such in,
but unfortunately the translations of 

1765
01:24:24,251 --> 01:24:25,084
the texts,
the translations of the techs are not 

1766
01:24:27,311 --> 01:24:29,950
translations of the text.
They misrepresent the text off.

1767
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:30,793
And what he did was he took a 19th 
century translation and he massaged it 

1768
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:37,000
so that it would fit his fit,
his argument.

1769
01:24:37,001 --> 01:24:37,834
And that's a pity.
So we need skeptics and they help us to 

1770
01:24:40,061 --> 01:24:41,970
sift out the wheat from the chaff and 
that.

1771
01:24:42,020 --> 01:24:44,680
But,
but at occasionally what the skeptics do

1772
01:24:44,980 --> 01:24:45,813
with this drive to,
to criticize anything that's not 

1773
01:24:49,061 --> 01:24:51,460
mainstream.
Occasionally what they do is they let go

1774
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:55,150
a really good idea which deserves 
investigation in which the human species

1775
01:24:55,151 --> 01:24:55,984
could benefit from.
And that's my feeling is where this 

1776
01:24:57,401 --> 01:25:00,340
amazing species,
we've developed all this science.

1777
01:25:00,580 --> 01:25:01,413
Why are we,
why are we so ready to let go of 

1778
01:25:04,421 --> 01:25:05,440
wonderful ideas?

1779
01:25:05,710 --> 01:25:08,260
Well,
it's also fascinating to me that because

1780
01:25:08,261 --> 01:25:09,094
of what situation has been sort of 
criticized for people now ignore the 

1781
01:25:12,541 --> 01:25:13,374
stuff that's absolutely undeniable.
Like the actual stone tablets 

1782
01:25:16,151 --> 01:25:17,470
themselves,
the clay tablets,

1783
01:25:17,820 --> 01:25:21,820
or you can see the depictions of the 
solar system somehow or another,

1784
01:25:21,821 --> 01:25:26,200
these people from 6,000
plus years ago had a detailed map of the

1785
01:25:26,201 --> 01:25:27,034
solar system.
Clear idea of the soldiers was the size 

1786
01:25:28,781 --> 01:25:31,120
in like a,
a relatively correct order.

1787
01:25:31,270 --> 01:25:32,103
And the planets in the right place.
Like they somehow or another knew that 

1788
01:25:35,201 --> 01:25:39,820
Jupiter was bigger than Mars.
They knew these things in some weird way

1789
01:25:39,850 --> 01:25:42,220
and we don't know why.
And we don't know how.

1790
01:25:42,490 --> 01:25:45,360
Also the caduceus representing the,
the,

1791
01:25:45,361 --> 01:25:47,590
the,
the double helix of the DNA.

1792
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:48,593
That's a really fascinating concept too,
that the caduceus is used for medicine 

1793
01:25:52,210 --> 01:25:53,043
and it's used to rep mean it's just,
he had some really interesting points 

1794
01:25:56,771 --> 01:25:58,660
saccharide did.
So it's Kinda,

1795
01:25:58,661 --> 01:25:59,494
it's Kinda too bad.
There was so much crazy involved in 

1796
01:26:01,121 --> 01:26:01,954
that.
I think

1797
01:26:02,070 --> 01:26:05,420
any of us should,
when we're exploring the deep and hidden

1798
01:26:05,421 --> 01:26:09,500
mysteries of the past is,
is to go to a lot of different sources.

1799
01:26:09,560 --> 01:26:11,830
Go to a lot of dots,
just stick with the mainstream.

1800
01:26:11,900 --> 01:26:12,733
Don't just stick with the alternative,
but try to tie it to bring it all 

1801
01:26:15,141 --> 01:26:15,980
together.
And in a way,

1802
01:26:15,981 --> 01:26:19,040
that's what I tried to do in my books 
except the skeptics still hate them.

1803
01:26:20,050 --> 01:26:24,410
But this is so hard because it's so,
it's so fun to go with the crazy story.

1804
01:26:24,510 --> 01:26:25,340
Yeah.
Like the,

1805
01:26:25,340 --> 01:26:28,400
the alien story is so compelling.
It's so fun.

1806
01:26:28,430 --> 01:26:29,780
Very compelling story.
I mean,

1807
01:26:29,781 --> 01:26:32,630
if we found some sort of evidence of 
aliens,

1808
01:26:32,631 --> 01:26:36,800
it would be so utterly spectacular.
Even if it was a simple alien.

1809
01:26:37,070 --> 01:26:37,903
Like I've always said this,
that if we found a a jellyfish on the 

1810
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:40,880
moon,
we would freak out.

1811
01:26:41,300 --> 01:26:43,310
But you know,
there's really complex,

1812
01:26:43,311 --> 01:26:44,144
bizarre things at the bottom of our 
ocean and we've never discovered just 

1813
01:26:46,731 --> 01:26:50,690
they're just not in the correct location
for us to be excited.

1814
01:26:50,810 --> 01:26:52,520
And then the other,
the other issue,

1815
01:26:52,550 --> 01:26:54,350
we're getting slightly off our flood 
topic here,

1816
01:26:54,980 --> 01:26:56,250
but the other issue of,
uh,

1817
01:26:56,251 --> 01:26:57,900
of,
of entities that,

1818
01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:02,920
that the encounters with entities,
anybody who smoked dmt will know that as

1819
01:27:04,281 --> 01:27:04,881
I have,
as,

1820
01:27:04,881 --> 01:27:05,714
as you have,
that will know that you do encounter 

1821
01:27:07,371 --> 01:27:10,760
entities in the DMT,
in the DMT state and they do communicate

1822
01:27:10,761 --> 01:27:11,594
with us.
And there's a lot of parallels with the 

1823
01:27:13,430 --> 01:27:17,630
ets or the aliens as they are described 
in modern ufo abduction accounts.

1824
01:27:18,160 --> 01:27:20,450
And Rick Strassman,
have you ever had them on your show?

1825
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:21,770
You know,
rick got sick.

1826
01:27:21,830 --> 01:27:23,690
He was supposed to be here a couple of 
times.

1827
01:27:23,691 --> 01:27:24,524
We're trying to reschedule it now,
but he had some pretty serious health 

1828
01:27:27,111 --> 01:27:29,390
issues now.
We had a date scheduled out,

1829
01:27:29,391 --> 01:27:30,224
but I love that guy.
I got a chance to sit down with them a 

1830
01:27:31,761 --> 01:27:34,810
couple of times and talked to them and I
have of course you presented dmt.

1831
01:27:34,820 --> 01:27:35,900
That's cool.
Yeah,

1832
01:27:35,901 --> 01:27:40,610
he's brilliant and he's so important to 
me because I remember when I did it,

1833
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:45,020
I was so confused.
I mean to me it was like the first,

1834
01:27:45,021 --> 01:27:48,590
my first dmt experience changed 
everything I thought about the world and

1835
01:27:48,591 --> 01:27:50,840
I immediately didn't give a shit about 
aliens anymore.

1836
01:27:50,900 --> 01:27:52,910
Right.
Like it was almost instantaneous.

1837
01:27:52,911 --> 01:27:56,780
Like before then I was like Roswell,
they've got the got the ship pan.

1838
01:27:56,810 --> 01:27:57,920
Yeah,
it's in a hangar.

1839
01:27:58,280 --> 01:27:59,113
But what I encountered doing dmt was so 
spectacularly alien that the pedestrian 

1840
01:28:03,771 --> 01:28:04,604
concept of something that looks like a 
person but has a bigger head in large 

1841
01:28:07,341 --> 01:28:08,810
eyes and high tech.
Yeah,

1842
01:28:09,380 --> 01:28:10,790
it's weird and cools.
It would be,

1843
01:28:10,791 --> 01:28:12,710
if it was real,
it was nothing.

1844
01:28:12,740 --> 01:28:13,573
I mean,
literally not 1000000th as interesting 

1845
01:28:15,980 --> 01:28:18,620
as what you absolutely can encounter 
when you do dmt.

1846
01:28:18,860 --> 01:28:20,930
That's the aliens.
That's the aliens.

1847
01:28:20,931 --> 01:28:24,290
And utterly alien realm filled with 
alien intelligences who commute.

1848
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:25,790
And of course again the skeptics say,
oh,

1849
01:28:25,791 --> 01:28:27,590
it's all just made up in your brain,
but we don't know.

1850
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:28,433
That is open to the possibility that we 
are dealing with areas of reality that 

1851
01:28:32,331 --> 01:28:34,340
are not normally accessible to our 
senses.

1852
01:28:34,341 --> 01:28:35,174
And that become accessible to our senses
by retuning the receiver wavelength of 

1853
01:28:37,971 --> 01:28:40,850
the brain,
which is what he suggests DMT does.

1854
01:28:40,851 --> 01:28:42,470
And I think,
I think that's very plausible.

1855
01:28:42,471 --> 01:28:43,304
And at the very least,
those who are interested in Ufos and 

1856
01:28:45,021 --> 01:28:48,250
aliens should be also investigating this
line of inquiry.

1857
01:28:48,270 --> 01:28:49,103
Can we,
can we use changes in consciousness to 

1858
01:28:52,011 --> 01:28:55,400
understand the majestic complexity of 
the universe in which we live?

1859
01:28:55,401 --> 01:28:57,080
And I think the answer is definitely 
yes.

1860
01:28:57,081 --> 01:29:00,050
And many of Rick's volunteers,
I paraphrase,

1861
01:29:00,410 --> 01:29:02,100
but they came with reports that

1862
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:03,900
the entities who had encountered them 
said,

1863
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:07,560
we're so glad you've discovered this 
technology.

1864
01:29:07,620 --> 01:29:10,110
Now we can communicate with you much 
more easily.

1865
01:29:11,010 --> 01:29:12,450
You know,
it's fascinating.

1866
01:29:12,570 --> 01:29:17,570
So there's a technology for encountering
other intelligences and against that,

1867
01:29:18,061 --> 01:29:18,894
this mechanistic simplistic alien meme 
that's going around now that they're a 

1868
01:29:21,841 --> 01:29:23,880
bit like us,
but they came here in higher tech,

1869
01:29:24,210 --> 01:29:25,043
higher tech.
It's dull by comparison with his dog by 

1870
01:29:28,051 --> 01:29:29,660
comparison,
if you're interested in anybody's,

1871
01:29:29,740 --> 01:29:31,380
the book is amazing.
It's called DMT,

1872
01:29:31,381 --> 01:29:32,214
the spirit molecule.
And he has a new book that he's putting 

1873
01:29:34,501 --> 01:29:37,200
out about dmt and the spirit and the 
soul of prophecy.

1874
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:39,900
And um,
he's just a really,

1875
01:29:39,901 --> 01:29:41,400
really interesting guy.
But his,

1876
01:29:41,610 --> 01:29:44,580
his experience that he did experiments 
that he did were the first,

1877
01:29:44,850 --> 01:29:45,683
I think in many,
many decades to get approved by the 

1878
01:29:47,941 --> 01:29:48,774
government.
Correct.

1879
01:29:48,900 --> 01:29:51,210
So he did everything above ground.
I mean,

1880
01:29:51,211 --> 01:29:52,410
he was above board.

1881
01:29:52,410 --> 01:29:53,970
He was a kid.
And because it,

1882
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:55,890
because it was government approved the,
his,

1883
01:29:55,950 --> 01:29:56,783
his remit was that he had to find some 
therapeutic benefit for dmt and he 

1884
01:30:00,571 --> 01:30:03,180
couldn't actually,
but that's not the point.

1885
01:30:03,810 --> 01:30:05,880
I'm sure actually there are therapeutic 
benefits,

1886
01:30:05,881 --> 01:30:06,714
but that's not the point.
The point is here is a tool for 

1887
01:30:08,941 --> 01:30:09,774
investigating the mystery of 
consciousness and the mysterious nature 

1888
01:30:12,001 --> 01:30:13,470
of reality.
I mean,

1889
01:30:13,471 --> 01:30:14,304
fuck me if we get five or six volunteers
who haven't compared notes all coming 

1890
01:30:17,641 --> 01:30:18,474
back who've met entities who said,
we're so happy you found this 

1891
01:30:20,521 --> 01:30:21,354
technology.
It's hard to explain that as just to 

1892
01:30:23,851 --> 01:30:26,010
reduce it to brain activity.
Not only that,

1893
01:30:26,011 --> 01:30:26,844
when we talk about things that are so 
big in are ignored by mainstream 

1894
01:30:30,541 --> 01:30:32,970
culture,
this is one that's just like that.

1895
01:30:32,971 --> 01:30:35,280
You're talking about an indogenous human
chemical.

1896
01:30:35,300 --> 01:30:36,133
Yeah.
That not only is in us but is in 

1897
01:30:37,891 --> 01:30:39,450
thousands of different plants.

1898
01:30:39,470 --> 01:30:41,610
Like I mean,
how many different plants contain DMT?

1899
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:42,593
Huge number.
Very prosaic ones like peas and you 

1900
01:30:45,781 --> 01:30:48,330
know,
there's the main store acacia.

1901
01:30:48,331 --> 01:30:51,720
That's what I was going to say.
The tree is actually illegal.

1902
01:30:51,870 --> 01:30:54,000
This isn't that.
But the Jerusalem,

1903
01:30:54,030 --> 01:30:54,863
uh,
the professors from the University of 

1904
01:30:56,490 --> 01:30:57,570
Jerusalem,
I believe that any Shannon,

1905
01:30:57,740 --> 01:30:58,800
yeah,
they were talking about,

1906
01:30:58,801 --> 01:31:01,860
they believe that that's what the story 
of the burning Bush and Moses's.

1907
01:31:01,950 --> 01:31:03,120
So that is,
um,

1908
01:31:03,150 --> 01:31:08,070
Mimosa with the DMT and Syrian root with
the monoamine oxidase inhibitor.

1909
01:31:08,071 --> 01:31:08,904
In other words,
it's,

1910
01:31:09,030 --> 01:31:10,920
it's Iowasca,
but a,

1911
01:31:10,921 --> 01:31:14,550
a Middle Eastern alternative of it doing
the same thing like molecularly.

1912
01:31:14,570 --> 01:31:15,403
And isn't it possible in some way that 
the idea of the burning Bush was them 

1913
01:31:18,481 --> 01:31:21,600
figuring out how to dry or extract DMT 
and burn it?

1914
01:31:21,601 --> 01:31:22,770
Very likely,
possibly.

1915
01:31:22,771 --> 01:31:23,604
Right?
Because they're talking about the 

1916
01:31:23,761 --> 01:31:27,540
burning Bush producing God,
and it just so happens that this bushes,

1917
01:31:27,740 --> 01:31:31,920
the Acacia tree is incredibly common and
super rich and DMT and it's all over the

1918
01:31:31,921 --> 01:31:32,754
area.
And I should probably insert at this 

1919
01:31:34,741 --> 01:31:37,650
point that if you're at all familiar 
with the masonic ritual,

1920
01:31:37,651 --> 01:31:40,530
you'll know that the acacia plant plays 
a central role.

1921
01:31:40,890 --> 01:31:43,950
That's why you're one of them.
1% Mason characters.

1922
01:31:44,010 --> 01:31:45,860
Everyone now,
every now allows insider.

1923
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:50,130
Every now and then on facebook Randall,
I get accused of being a free mason.

1924
01:31:50,550 --> 01:31:54,370
Hancock is a freemason.
That's not as exciting as that.

1925
01:31:54,371 --> 01:31:56,730
It explains everything.
I know lots of free masons.

1926
01:31:56,731 --> 01:31:57,564
I spoken in Masonic Lodges,
but I'm an author and they belong to 

1927
01:31:59,860 --> 01:32:00,250
clubs.

1928
01:32:00,250 --> 01:32:01,660
You know,
I went to a fee,

1929
01:32:01,690 --> 01:32:02,523
I went to a wedding that my friend 
Duncan trussell was performing at and 

1930
01:32:05,281 --> 01:32:09,340
for these two satanists and like 2003 
and to this day it was,

1931
01:32:10,070 --> 01:32:13,690
what's the one of the lovies?
Anton Levay or Stanton Levay,

1932
01:32:13,691 --> 01:32:17,110
whatever is his son.
And his son got married.

1933
01:32:17,111 --> 01:32:19,510
It was some young hedonist,
you know,

1934
01:32:19,511 --> 01:32:21,230
and they call themselves satanists and 
a,

1935
01:32:21,250 --> 01:32:24,040
so dunkin performed at this a wedding 
and I went there.

1936
01:32:24,310 --> 01:32:25,143
To this day,
I get fucking tweets about being a 

1937
01:32:27,311 --> 01:32:29,290
satanist.
So I can't join your little club pal.

1938
01:32:29,640 --> 01:32:32,420
I can't go into your masons.
I need to confess here.

1939
01:32:33,100 --> 01:32:34,390
Yes.
You didn't realize this,

1940
01:32:34,391 --> 01:32:37,060
but I secretly initiated you.
Oh my God.

1941
01:32:37,090 --> 01:32:37,923
Oh,
you're in.

1942
01:32:38,360 --> 01:32:39,193
So you get in.
How do you still feel the initiated 

1943
01:32:40,520 --> 01:32:42,250
somebody?
Can you do that for real?

1944
01:32:42,700 --> 01:32:44,310
No,
I'm scared.

1945
01:32:44,620 --> 01:32:45,453
I sort of did sort of,
so you could get him in if you want it 

1946
01:32:47,771 --> 01:32:48,604
to though,
right?

1947
01:32:48,700 --> 01:32:51,910
If you know the people,
of course you even you joe.

1948
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:53,410
I don't think so.
It's on helping,

1949
01:32:53,470 --> 01:32:54,500
bro.
I,

1950
01:32:54,940 --> 01:32:56,830
I met a couple of masons.
They're very cool.

1951
01:32:56,890 --> 01:32:57,723
Well,
most masons don't really understand the 

1952
01:33:00,371 --> 01:33:03,880
corpus of symbolism.
That's that they're sitting on top of,

1953
01:33:03,910 --> 01:33:06,190
I got to say that not to get off on the 
free masons,

1954
01:33:06,191 --> 01:33:07,024
but same thing.
There's a mass of symbolism and that's 

1955
01:33:09,611 --> 01:33:11,350
the whole,
that's,

1956
01:33:11,380 --> 01:33:12,213
that's the thing that they are 
custodians of and most of them don't 

1957
01:33:14,111 --> 01:33:14,944
have a clue what it means.
But near doing an important job by 

1958
01:33:17,141 --> 01:33:19,570
preserving this corpus of symbolism 
through the,

1959
01:33:19,990 --> 01:33:22,180
through the layout of the lodge,
the,

1960
01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:23,313
um,
the meaning of every component in the 

1961
01:33:25,451 --> 01:33:28,420
lodge because it's a purely astronomical
allegory.

1962
01:33:28,840 --> 01:33:29,673
And then you have the masonic carpets 
and that's where you have the whole 

1963
01:33:31,541 --> 01:33:33,280
story of the comet,
the flood.

1964
01:33:33,281 --> 01:33:34,090
It's all there.

1965
01:33:34,090 --> 01:33:36,220
The acacia plant,
it's all there.

1966
01:33:36,280 --> 01:33:37,570
It's all,
correct me if I'm wrong,

1967
01:33:37,571 --> 01:33:38,470
but it's,
it's all,

1968
01:33:38,471 --> 01:33:39,304
uh,
also an integral part of how Washington 

1969
01:33:40,661 --> 01:33:43,210
DC was designed.
Is that true?

1970
01:33:43,450 --> 01:33:44,710
Yeah,
to some extent.

1971
01:33:44,711 --> 01:33:45,281
I haven't,
you know,

1972
01:33:45,281 --> 01:33:49,900
I honestly haven't studied that.
What I've seen is that there's a,

1973
01:33:49,901 --> 01:33:52,040
there's a bunch of videos we could watch
it where they started.

1974
01:33:52,050 --> 01:33:54,420
Describe how the layout,
you know,

1975
01:33:54,430 --> 01:33:56,830
is in some way some sort of sacred 
geometry.

1976
01:33:57,280 --> 01:33:58,113
I think what it's based on.
Free masons were massively involved in 

1977
01:34:00,671 --> 01:34:01,504
the construction of Washington as they 
were as many great cities and city I 

1978
01:34:03,451 --> 01:34:06,880
lived in England has got,
you know the major masonic architecture.

1979
01:34:06,881 --> 01:34:09,370
So is it like people like me,
like my initial prejudice,

1980
01:34:09,371 --> 01:34:12,100
I hear something like the Mason was like
up fucking dudes in a cult.

1981
01:34:12,130 --> 01:34:13,420
Get outta here,
leave me alone.

1982
01:34:13,570 --> 01:34:17,770
Like we,
we assume that all groups of people that

1983
01:34:17,771 --> 01:34:22,120
follow anything somehow or another a 
wacky Mason's in my opinion,

1984
01:34:22,121 --> 01:34:23,680
they're largely a drinking club for men.

1985
01:34:23,980 --> 01:34:26,560
Mainly that's what it is women in at 
all.

1986
01:34:26,620 --> 01:34:27,453
But they,
you can make special arrangements to 

1987
01:34:28,361 --> 01:34:32,290
bring women into my life.
When I've given a talk in a lodge,

1988
01:34:32,291 --> 01:34:33,124
I've given talks in two or three lodges 
been asked to do so then they make a 

1989
01:34:36,521 --> 01:34:37,354
special ceremony to allow my wife Santha
to coming cause I won't go anywhere 

1990
01:34:39,971 --> 01:34:42,850
without Santa's.
So women can,

1991
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:44,800
women can go in,
but then there are more,

1992
01:34:44,801 --> 01:34:45,634
there are others within masonry who are 
pursuing deeply esoteric interest and 

1993
01:34:48,911 --> 01:34:49,744
exploring the mysteries and you can have
incredible conversations and facet and 

1994
01:34:53,050 --> 01:34:55,900
it's just another,
another group of people who you know are

1995
01:34:55,901 --> 01:34:56,320
doing,
uh,

1996
01:34:56,320 --> 01:34:57,500
doing their thing.
It's not for me.

1997
01:34:57,501 --> 01:34:58,220
I wouldn't join,

1998
01:34:58,220 --> 01:34:59,270
I don't,
I would lose.

1999
01:34:59,300 --> 01:35:01,910
I think if I joined free masonry it 
would,

2000
01:35:01,911 --> 01:35:02,744
we can meet as an author I think.
I think I'm better able to comment on 

2001
01:35:05,691 --> 01:35:07,460
these things by not being a member of 
any such.

2002
01:35:07,461 --> 01:35:08,211
Great.
That's interesting.

2003
01:35:08,211 --> 01:35:09,980
Why do you think that?
Well,

2004
01:35:10,040 --> 01:35:12,860
because I think I have to remain open to
all possibilities and if I,

2005
01:35:12,861 --> 01:35:15,290
if I,
if I commit myself to a particular line,

2006
01:35:15,291 --> 01:35:17,270
I don't commit myself to a particular 
religion.

2007
01:35:17,271 --> 01:35:20,090
I don't protect,
commit myself to a particular men's club

2008
01:35:20,091 --> 01:35:20,811
either.
I just,

2009
01:35:20,811 --> 01:35:23,780
which is what masonry is.
I think if I commit that then,

2010
01:35:23,800 --> 01:35:24,633
but then ultimately I would become a 
spokesperson for that and I don't want 

2011
01:35:27,561 --> 01:35:29,090
to be that.
That makes a lot of sense.

2012
01:35:29,091 --> 01:35:29,924
Considering your occupation and how 
important being open minded has been to 

2013
01:35:32,991 --> 01:35:34,130
your life.
It's vital.

2014
01:35:34,280 --> 01:35:36,380
It's absolutely,
absolutely without it.

2015
01:35:36,380 --> 01:35:38,300
How could you have ever done 
fingerprints of the gods?

2016
01:35:38,360 --> 01:35:41,230
I could not.
I mean the,

2017
01:35:41,231 --> 01:35:42,110
the,
the thing,

2018
01:35:42,111 --> 01:35:43,760
the initial thing where,
uh,

2019
01:35:43,820 --> 01:35:47,750
you were telling me about Ethiopia,
that place where they believe that the,

2020
01:35:47,780 --> 01:35:48,613
the arc of the covenant lays,
which is one of the most bizarre ideas 

2021
01:35:52,761 --> 01:35:53,594
ever,
and that was my first book on a 

2022
01:35:55,371 --> 01:35:57,260
historical mystery was the sign and the 
ceiling.

2023
01:35:57,800 --> 01:36:01,520
You go into it,
it's so interesting,

2024
01:36:01,640 --> 01:36:02,473
but I just,
I've always imagined you as a young guy 

2025
01:36:04,881 --> 01:36:08,990
forced to sort of reconcile with this 
bizarre piece of evidence.

2026
01:36:08,991 --> 01:36:11,750
You've got these old men that have 
cataracts in her eyes,

2027
01:36:11,751 --> 01:36:12,584
like they were on radiation sites and no
one's allowed to go inside and see this 

2028
01:36:15,711 --> 01:36:16,544
thing and they claim they have the Ark 
of the covenant in there and like what 

2029
01:36:18,831 --> 01:36:21,800
the fuck is,
it was the beginning of the magic.

2030
01:36:21,800 --> 01:36:23,630
It was the beginning of a magical 
journey for me.

2031
01:36:23,690 --> 01:36:25,700
It's been a magical journey for all your
fans too.

2032
01:36:25,701 --> 01:36:26,750
For guys like me,
man,

2033
01:36:26,751 --> 01:36:29,300
when I read fingerprints of the gods,
it was to me,

2034
01:36:29,301 --> 01:36:30,134
it was a one of those books I just 
couldn't put down and it was so mind 

2035
01:36:32,091 --> 01:36:36,700
blowing and this is again was in the 
heart of my fucking thank you.

2036
01:36:36,820 --> 01:36:37,653
Prince was published in 1995 and 
magicians came out in 20 in 2015 and I 

2037
01:36:41,541 --> 01:36:42,374
would say in that time the,
the evidence when I made the case for a 

2038
01:36:45,381 --> 01:36:49,160
lost civilization and a global cataclysm
in fingerprints of the gods,

2039
01:36:49,550 --> 01:36:50,383
I can't begin to account for the amount 
of hostility and anger and rage that I 

2040
01:36:55,161 --> 01:36:58,520
generated in the academic community.
The idea was considered to be absolutely

2041
01:36:58,521 --> 01:37:01,400
absurd 20 years later with magicians of 
the gods.

2042
01:37:01,460 --> 01:37:03,090
It's not so absurd anymore.

2043
01:37:03,110 --> 01:37:03,943
The evidence is mounting.
We have incredible evidence now for a 

2044
01:37:07,311 --> 01:37:08,144
global cataclysm in exactly the period 
that counts between twelve thousand 

2045
01:37:12,170 --> 01:37:13,190
eight hundred eleven thousand six 
hundred years ago and we have sites,

2046
01:37:13,191 --> 01:37:14,120
Laker Beckley,
Tempe.

2047
01:37:14,121 --> 01:37:14,954
We have a redefinition of the Sphinx.
The whole area is just about to explode 

2048
01:37:19,010 --> 01:37:19,631
in,
in,

2049
01:37:19,631 --> 01:37:20,510
in,
in the future.

2050
01:37:20,511 --> 01:37:21,344
We're on the edge.
I believe of a of a paradigm shift in 

2051
01:37:23,161 --> 01:37:23,994
this comic material is central to it.
What I really appreciate about your 

2052
01:37:26,211 --> 01:37:27,044
courage is that you've also had the 
courage to admit when you've made 

2053
01:37:29,691 --> 01:37:30,700
mistakes.
You're,

2054
01:37:30,740 --> 01:37:31,573
you're not,
you don't in any way pretend to be some 

2055
01:37:33,711 --> 01:37:37,700
sort of a bear of secret knowledge that 
no one else possesses.

2056
01:37:37,701 --> 01:37:40,430
Absolutely not a guru.
I don't want to be anything like that.

2057
01:37:40,431 --> 01:37:41,660
I'm a reporter.
That's,

2058
01:37:41,661 --> 01:37:42,494
that's what I am and I'm,
I'm a reporter who's reporting on 

2059
01:37:45,050 --> 01:37:48,050
offbeat subjects and to some extent I'm 
an I'm an outsider.

2060
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:51,500
It's one of the talks I do now.
It's about being an being an outsider.

2061
01:37:51,501 --> 01:37:52,334
I think there is a,
I think there is a place for outsiders 

2062
01:37:53,871 --> 01:37:56,280
in society.
I don't think you're an outsider.

2063
01:37:56,310 --> 01:38:00,480
I think you're an outsider from the 
established mainstream ideas.

2064
01:38:00,690 --> 01:38:03,120
I just think that I do love the same.
We're both,

2065
01:38:03,121 --> 01:38:03,954
we're both outside is in that area.
I'm working in different fields to get 

2066
01:38:06,241 --> 01:38:07,074
into this,
but don't you think that these 

2067
01:38:07,621 --> 01:38:11,580
established channels that were so deeply
grooved in distributing information,

2068
01:38:11,581 --> 01:38:12,414
those things have widened so wide now 
where you're getting [inaudible] a 

2069
01:38:16,440 --> 01:38:20,790
professor could do a podcast,
like he could teach a class and go write

2070
01:38:20,791 --> 01:38:25,770
a book or he can do a podcast on a 
certain subject and like you're aware of

2071
01:38:25,771 --> 01:38:29,460
Dan Carlin and that hardcore history 
podcast I just can't stop raving about.

2072
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:33,300
But what he's done is brought 
historical,

2073
01:38:33,301 --> 01:38:34,134
accurate,
but really dramatic stories of real 

2074
01:38:37,171 --> 01:38:40,070
events that took place to millions.
Like,

2075
01:38:40,071 --> 01:38:40,904
you know,
that's just that no one's doing that 

2076
01:38:42,240 --> 01:38:44,910
like this is,
but it's not mainstream.

2077
01:38:45,060 --> 01:38:48,060
Well,
what's more mainstream than being number

2078
01:38:48,061 --> 01:38:51,630
one on the itunes podcast list,
which he has all the time.

2079
01:38:51,750 --> 01:38:55,080
What is more mainstream and he must be 
getting millions of downloads.

2080
01:38:55,110 --> 01:38:55,943
It's part of the big changes taking 
place in our society that the old 

2081
01:38:58,081 --> 01:39:00,930
structures are being overthrown.
That being thrown away.

2082
01:39:00,931 --> 01:39:01,764
It's a very uncomfortable time.
It's a very uncertain time is a very 

2083
01:39:03,541 --> 01:39:04,840
exciting time,
right?

2084
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:05,753
Because we can build out of this 
something something amazing in the 

2085
01:39:07,681 --> 01:39:08,514
future.
The Internet is had a huge part to play 

2086
01:39:09,571 --> 01:39:10,404
in it.
The fact that people can communicate 

2087
01:39:11,131 --> 01:39:11,964
with one another all around the world.
Since I've had a web presence in the 

2088
01:39:14,101 --> 01:39:15,900
last,
I was late comer,

2089
01:39:15,930 --> 01:39:20,040
but maybe two or two to three years ago 
I've been getting contacted by,

2090
01:39:20,430 --> 01:39:22,710
I mean professionals from around the 
world.

2091
01:39:22,711 --> 01:39:23,544
I've got probably a dozen major ones.
I've geologists who want to know more 

2092
01:39:27,151 --> 01:39:30,540
about an interest in what you said 
earlier about debating.

2093
01:39:30,660 --> 01:39:31,493
You know,
I'm always looking for somebody to 

2094
01:39:33,061 --> 01:39:35,040
debate about I,
you know,

2095
01:39:35,070 --> 01:39:38,220
because I have questions and I'm 
thinking maybe somebody,

2096
01:39:38,221 --> 01:39:41,820
even somebody who would disagree with me
on something good still helped me answer

2097
01:39:41,821 --> 01:39:42,730
some of the questions.

2098
01:39:42,740 --> 01:39:43,573
Right.
But I tried to associate as much as 

2099
01:39:45,991 --> 01:39:49,320
possible and hang out with professionals
in the field.

2100
01:39:49,380 --> 01:39:53,820
And of course what I discover is that a 
lot of them are working in these things,

2101
01:39:53,821 --> 01:39:54,654
park time,
almost clandestinely without making it 

2102
01:39:56,581 --> 01:39:57,900
part of their,
you know,

2103
01:39:57,930 --> 01:40:00,600
if I go on a field trip of geologists 
into the,

2104
01:40:00,690 --> 01:40:01,523
the flood lands,
none of them are really working on it 

2105
01:40:03,691 --> 01:40:05,160
full time.
It's all part time.

2106
01:40:05,310 --> 01:40:06,143
You know,
they're working for the government or 

2107
01:40:06,691 --> 01:40:09,200
working for the oil companies are,
you know,

2108
01:40:09,240 --> 01:40:11,520
x exploration,
mineral exploration,

2109
01:40:11,521 --> 01:40:12,354
whatever.
They're doing this research into 

2110
01:40:13,950 --> 01:40:17,790
geological catastrophes.
[inaudible] on their own time.

2111
01:40:18,120 --> 01:40:19,470
Right.
But recently,

2112
01:40:19,471 --> 01:40:20,304
just last summer,
I got invited to actually present some 

2113
01:40:23,131 --> 01:40:26,370
of my research to the Atlanta Geological
Society,

2114
01:40:26,371 --> 01:40:27,204
which is the largest society of 
professional geologists in the 

2115
01:40:30,780 --> 01:40:34,440
southeast.
So I jumped at the chance rather than,

2116
01:40:34,680 --> 01:40:35,513
you know,
and so I presented hoping that I would 

2117
01:40:37,171 --> 01:40:38,640
get challenged,
that somebody would say,

2118
01:40:38,641 --> 01:40:40,860
wait a second,
there's a flaw in your thinking.

2119
01:40:40,860 --> 01:40:41,693
Your didn't happen.
So did you make friends with some of 

2120
01:40:44,251 --> 01:40:45,000
these,
uh,

2121
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:46,410
mainstream geologists?
Yeah,

2122
01:40:46,411 --> 01:40:46,831
well,
I mean,

2123
01:40:46,831 --> 01:40:47,670
I've been knowing,
I mean,

2124
01:40:47,671 --> 01:40:49,320
when I,
I just took a trip for,

2125
01:40:49,321 --> 01:40:50,310
um,
uh,

2126
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:52,290
in September,
spent 10,

2127
01:40:52,380 --> 01:40:54,450
10 days back out in the flood lions.
Yeah.

2128
01:40:55,460 --> 01:40:58,750
I had a geologist with me on that trip.
Um,

2129
01:40:58,990 --> 01:41:01,450
so yeah,
I'm getting to know more and more people

2130
01:41:01,451 --> 01:41:02,970
who are working as well.
You know,

2131
01:41:02,971 --> 01:41:04,850
I,
I majored in geology in college,

2132
01:41:04,990 --> 01:41:09,580
so I still am in touch regularly with 
the head of the geology department.

2133
01:41:09,581 --> 01:41:10,414
I see her pretty much on a regular basis
and had been keeping her apprised of 

2134
01:41:13,271 --> 01:41:18,271
some of my stuff and she has off offered
to sponsor me at whatever point.

2135
01:41:18,311 --> 01:41:20,770
I think that I can pull it together as a
dissertation,

2136
01:41:22,120 --> 01:41:23,590
but we'll see how that goes.
I mean,

2137
01:41:23,740 --> 01:41:27,850
my objective was to learn geology,
not to become a professional geologist.

2138
01:41:27,851 --> 01:41:28,684
I wasn't interested in working for the 
government or working for the energy 

2139
01:41:31,991 --> 01:41:32,824
industry.
I had geological questions and that's 

2140
01:41:34,391 --> 01:41:35,740
why I majored in geology.

2141
01:41:35,910 --> 01:41:38,370
And you've walked the walk.
And in my opinion,

2142
01:41:38,371 --> 01:41:42,400
you know more about this stuff than 10 
fully phd geologists.

2143
01:41:42,420 --> 01:41:45,260
So you always freaked me out.
So what's,

2144
01:41:45,270 --> 01:41:46,900
what's fascinating to me,
uh,

2145
01:41:46,940 --> 01:41:51,570
about all this is that I think what 
you've done has been very measured.

2146
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:52,673
You know,
everything you back up with facts and 

2147
01:41:54,061 --> 01:41:57,330
photographs and descriptions and 
disclaimers.

2148
01:41:57,331 --> 01:41:58,350
You know when you,
when you say,

2149
01:41:58,351 --> 01:41:59,700
well it's,
it is possible.

2150
01:41:59,701 --> 01:42:00,534
You will go down other various paths.
You're not dogmatic about these ideas 

2151
01:42:03,511 --> 01:42:08,280
but you've spent so much time going over
this.

2152
01:42:08,570 --> 01:42:09,403
I don't know if there's another,
if there's a commensurate guy in 

2153
01:42:12,901 --> 01:42:13,734
mainstream archeology that has been 
public about it the way you have been 

2154
01:42:16,651 --> 01:42:18,810
because if there is,
I feel like we probably would have heard

2155
01:42:18,811 --> 01:42:19,644
about them.
Your podcasts have been the ones that 

2156
01:42:21,271 --> 01:42:22,104
we've done.
They'd been seen by millions of people 

2157
01:42:24,150 --> 01:42:25,230
they didn't listen to.

2158
01:42:25,230 --> 01:42:26,880
By millions of people.
I mean the,

2159
01:42:26,950 --> 01:42:29,550
the information is getting out there and
making a real difference.

2160
01:42:30,030 --> 01:42:32,520
You're always going to have the,
the guys like I think Michael Shermer is

2161
01:42:32,521 --> 01:42:33,354
very important and not criticizing him 
and put that knee jerk reaction to do 

2162
01:42:35,881 --> 01:42:39,690
something to mock something or put down 
something that's not mainstream.

2163
01:42:40,020 --> 01:42:42,120
Like one of his tweets,
he said,

2164
01:42:42,140 --> 01:42:44,910
you know what archeology with evidence 
is,

2165
01:42:45,030 --> 01:42:47,880
and he wrote archeology.
Like why would you even tweet that?

2166
01:42:48,240 --> 01:42:49,720
This doesn't even make any sense like 
that.

2167
01:42:49,740 --> 01:42:52,350
That's someone who's not paying 
attention to your work that makes it all

2168
01:42:52,351 --> 01:42:55,490
you do is focus on Evan.
I'm reminded of the Shakespearian line.

2169
01:42:55,491 --> 01:42:57,780
We thinks the lady doth protest too 
much.

2170
01:42:57,810 --> 01:42:59,940
Why does he need to say that?
It's got the evidence.

2171
01:42:59,941 --> 01:43:00,774
You know,
always tweets like Fox News saying fair 

2172
01:43:02,551 --> 01:43:05,160
and balanced.
You know he's tweeting at you with this.

2173
01:43:05,430 --> 01:43:06,263
Meanwhile,
your entire book is based on 

2174
01:43:08,191 --> 01:43:11,970
photographic evidence and all the other 
various pieces of evidence.

2175
01:43:11,971 --> 01:43:16,971
I mean that you're examining all these 
pieces of evidence.

2176
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:18,273
It's not,
these aren't things that you've 

2177
01:43:19,081 --> 01:43:20,000
invented.
No,

2178
01:43:20,130 --> 01:43:22,980
these are actual real sites that you can
look at.

2179
01:43:23,040 --> 01:43:25,590
I'm drawing inferences from them that 
they don't like.

2180
01:43:25,680 --> 01:43:26,850
That's the thing.
Well,

2181
01:43:26,851 --> 01:43:29,970
what Robert Schoch and guys like him are
so important.

2182
01:43:29,971 --> 01:43:30,804
Guys who have the courage that WHO's a 
Boston university professor has the 

2183
01:43:34,561 --> 01:43:39,390
courage to look at the stones and say,
this is the product of water erosion.

2184
01:43:39,391 --> 01:43:42,550
The stones.
Kudos to rubbish Shellac as a geologist,

2185
01:43:42,551 --> 01:43:43,384
as a,
as a a career academic geologist who's 

2186
01:43:45,301 --> 01:43:46,134
taken that risk and put himself out 
there and follow the evidence where it 

2187
01:43:48,901 --> 01:43:49,734
leads.
Another one is Danny hilman not to with 

2188
01:43:50,691 --> 01:43:52,640
judge in Indonesia

2189
01:43:52,670 --> 01:43:55,820
who's been responsible for the 
investigation of this extraordinary site

2190
01:43:55,821 --> 01:43:57,590
at Gunung Padang.
Uh,

2191
01:43:57,620 --> 01:44:00,890
where work has been stopped since 2014 
again,

2192
01:44:00,891 --> 01:44:01,724
he's a highly credential geologist is 
Indonesia's leading expert in mega 

2193
01:44:05,241 --> 01:44:08,030
thrust earthquakes,
but he's been looking at archeology,

2194
01:44:08,031 --> 01:44:11,120
bringing his geological expertise to 
that.

2195
01:44:11,121 --> 01:44:13,610
So the things are changing.
We are finding,

2196
01:44:13,611 --> 01:44:17,570
we are finding academics who are willing
to engage and willing to to discuss.

2197
01:44:17,571 --> 01:44:18,404
I,
I got into a very interesting email 

2198
01:44:20,151 --> 01:44:20,984
correspondence with a guy called Daniel 
Lowman at Baalbek but from the German 

2199
01:44:23,661 --> 01:44:27,890
archeological institute who's an 
architect and an archeologist and he was

2200
01:44:27,891 --> 01:44:30,350
very civil with me and he answered my 
questions.

2201
01:44:30,351 --> 01:44:32,930
We went into it in depth.
We had quite a long debate.

2202
01:44:32,931 --> 01:44:33,764
That's very refreshing.
That kind of thing wasn't happening 20 

2203
01:44:35,361 --> 01:44:36,470
years ago.
Yeah,

2204
01:44:36,471 --> 01:44:40,550
that is very refreshing.
Now what about those pyramids in Bosnia?

2205
01:44:40,640 --> 01:44:42,380
Has that been?
What is,

2206
01:44:42,410 --> 01:44:43,310
what is the deal with that?

2207
01:44:43,360 --> 01:44:45,230
I,
those things I've been there,

2208
01:44:45,560 --> 01:44:48,560
I know some were magic personally.
Same as the guy who's,

2209
01:44:48,561 --> 01:44:50,690
who's promoted the site.
Um,

2210
01:44:50,900 --> 01:44:52,950
I liked sam very much.
Um,

2211
01:44:53,030 --> 01:44:56,240
I must say when I'm in his aura,
I'm extremely convinced.

2212
01:44:56,720 --> 01:44:57,950
Uh,
but when I,

2213
01:44:57,980 --> 01:45:01,580
when I look rationally at the,
at the so-called Pyramids,

2214
01:45:01,610 --> 01:45:03,440
I don't think there are pyramids.
I think they're hills.

2215
01:45:03,470 --> 01:45:08,470
I did spend with Sam showing me around,
I did spend three days in Bosnia looking

2216
01:45:08,661 --> 01:45:10,910
at the so called Pyramid of the Sun,
the Pyramid of the moon.

2217
01:45:10,911 --> 01:45:13,190
They love pyramid and so on and so 
forth.

2218
01:45:13,520 --> 01:45:14,353
I do see that,
uh,

2219
01:45:14,590 --> 01:45:18,110
a tourist industry has built up around 
this and it's a fabulously beautiful,

2220
01:45:18,111 --> 01:45:19,940
intriguing site.
Massive,

2221
01:45:19,941 --> 01:45:22,460
beautiful mountainous place.
But they are hills.

2222
01:45:22,520 --> 01:45:24,560
They are not pyramids.
Impression is,

2223
01:45:24,561 --> 01:45:28,070
given that there are tunnels,
passageways inside the pyramids,

2224
01:45:28,071 --> 01:45:30,620
that's not true.
The passageways are about two,

2225
01:45:30,680 --> 01:45:32,300
two and a half kilometers away.

2226
01:45:32,570 --> 01:45:34,700
They're very low tech.
Um,

2227
01:45:34,850 --> 01:45:36,020
I,
I just don't,

2228
01:45:36,110 --> 01:45:37,520
I just don't see it.
And for that reason,

2229
01:45:37,521 --> 01:45:40,130
I did not cover the Bosnian pyramids and
magicians of the Gods.

2230
01:45:40,131 --> 01:45:41,930
I'm not going to say they're not 
pyramids.

2231
01:45:41,931 --> 01:45:44,330
I'm not going to write a book saying 
that they're wrong,

2232
01:45:44,750 --> 01:45:49,370
but I they didn't excite me enough to 
justify devoting a chapter to them.

2233
01:45:49,371 --> 01:45:53,330
There's much more exciting and important
archeological discoveries that are being

2234
01:45:53,331 --> 01:45:54,590
made,
like go back to the Tempe,

2235
01:45:54,591 --> 01:45:55,424
which need more space and there's some,
there's some pyramid like structures or 

2236
01:45:58,881 --> 01:45:59,714
hills and China as well,
right as the thousands of pyramids in 

2237
01:46:02,721 --> 01:46:05,400
China cm,
the province of crm,

2238
01:46:05,401 --> 01:46:08,660
and it's just the moment you land there 
for a few aircraft.

2239
01:46:08,661 --> 01:46:09,494
You're seeing pyramids everywhere.
I've been feeling that there are 

2240
01:46:11,961 --> 01:46:12,794
certainly hundreds and hundreds of them 
distributed across fields vanishing off 

2241
01:46:16,521 --> 01:46:19,370
into the distance in all,
in all directions.

2242
01:46:19,550 --> 01:46:22,430
They'd been terrorist and used as 
agriculture,

2243
01:46:22,550 --> 01:46:25,580
but local farmers grow,
grow crops on them.

2244
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:30,050
I went there with Chinese archeologists.
They haven't excavated a single one,

2245
01:46:30,350 --> 01:46:32,540
not one.
Why not?

2246
01:46:32,600 --> 01:46:34,160
They said,
we don't have,

2247
01:46:34,161 --> 01:46:35,900
this was nearly 10 years ago.
I was there.

2248
01:46:35,901 --> 01:46:37,220
They said they probably got the money 
now,

2249
01:46:37,221 --> 01:46:38,960
but they said then they didn't have the 
money.

2250
01:46:39,350 --> 01:46:40,820
They said,
we're an old country.

2251
01:46:41,120 --> 01:46:46,040
We don't mind if we wait 200 years to 
get to grips with this is Christ and the

2252
01:46:46,041 --> 01:46:49,160
famous tomb of the first emperor is part
of this pattern.

2253
01:46:49,170 --> 01:46:50,190
It is also a pyramid.

2254
01:46:50,190 --> 01:46:51,023
It has also not been excavated.
The terracotta army around it has been 

2255
01:46:53,461 --> 01:46:56,160
from the terracotta army is amazing.
Oh yeah.

2256
01:46:56,580 --> 01:46:58,260
It was on display somewhere,
wasn't it?

2257
01:46:58,261 --> 01:47:00,470
Where you can go and see it live.
They did some kind of trouble.

2258
01:47:00,510 --> 01:47:03,060
I want to see that thing.
I'd want to look at those things.

2259
01:47:03,061 --> 01:47:06,570
What put a bizarre concept now these 
pyramids.

2260
01:47:06,720 --> 01:47:08,370
So this one that this,
uh,

2261
01:47:08,371 --> 01:47:11,700
this emperor was buried in,
that had the terracotta army.

2262
01:47:11,970 --> 01:47:14,280
Was that a pyramid as well?
It is a period.

2263
01:47:14,460 --> 01:47:15,480
It is,
absolutely.

2264
01:47:15,481 --> 01:47:17,040
It's a manmade pyramid.
Uh,

2265
01:47:17,041 --> 01:47:20,490
the terracotta army was buried around 
its edges,

2266
01:47:20,580 --> 01:47:23,850
not in the pyramid itself.
So the army was there to protect him,

2267
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:27,150
to protect his soul into the afterlife.
Seems to be in the,

2268
01:47:27,180 --> 01:47:29,910
seems to be in the idea.
And then there's a mythology that's come

2269
01:47:29,911 --> 01:47:30,744
down that the,
that within the pyramid is a lake of 

2270
01:47:32,731 --> 01:47:33,564
mercury.

2271
01:47:33,930 --> 01:47:38,580
That there are mechanical devices in 
there which will fire arrows at you.

2272
01:47:38,581 --> 01:47:39,414
If you go in there.
There's a whole story about how how 

2273
01:47:41,161 --> 01:47:43,870
intensely protected it is.
And up to this day,

2274
01:47:43,871 --> 01:47:46,320
it's not been excavated.
That's so crazy.

2275
01:47:46,321 --> 01:47:48,390
How could someone leave that alone?
And you know,

2276
01:47:48,391 --> 01:47:52,200
even major archeological sites like t 
when Arco in Bolivia for example,

2277
01:47:52,290 --> 01:47:55,170
you'll find that only about 2% of the 
scientists being excavated.

2278
01:47:55,171 --> 01:47:56,004
I don't know how we can draw inferences 
about the whole site from a tiny little 

2279
01:47:58,921 --> 01:48:00,450
fragment fraction like that.
And that's the,

2280
01:48:00,870 --> 01:48:04,320
that's the problem I think with 
archeology and it's why we have to,

2281
01:48:04,730 --> 01:48:06,270
you know,
consider another way.

2282
01:48:06,300 --> 01:48:07,133
We're looking at an image of the 
terracotta army now in front of this 

2283
01:48:10,801 --> 01:48:14,610
pyramid and it is spectacular now that I
think about it.

2284
01:48:14,611 --> 01:48:17,040
I don't think that was on display 
anywhere.

2285
01:48:17,100 --> 01:48:18,750
I think maybe they had a couple of them.

2286
01:48:18,750 --> 01:48:20,700
They brought some of them.
They came to the British Museum.

2287
01:48:20,701 --> 01:48:21,534
There were a number of museums,
but it's so much bigger than I thought 

2288
01:48:23,191 --> 01:48:24,024
it was.
Yeah.

2289
01:48:24,360 --> 01:48:25,380
I mean there's,
I mean,

2290
01:48:25,381 --> 01:48:26,850
how many,
there's thousands.

2291
01:48:27,030 --> 01:48:29,190
There's thousands of these terracotta 
figures.

2292
01:48:29,250 --> 01:48:31,590
Absolutely.
And this period was made out of,

2293
01:48:31,591 --> 01:48:33,870
what is it?
Stone rammed earth mainly.

2294
01:48:34,440 --> 01:48:37,440
Okay.
So they just sort of shaped the,

2295
01:48:37,480 --> 01:48:41,190
the ground they just dug around.
They brought in earth and turn it into a

2296
01:48:41,310 --> 01:48:43,350
pyramid of mouse over the,
but it wasn't,

2297
01:48:43,520 --> 01:48:46,280
it was just massive stone blocks.
It's not massive stuff.

2298
01:48:46,281 --> 01:48:48,870
That's why they can grow crops on the 
sides of some of these pyramids.

2299
01:48:49,140 --> 01:48:49,973
How weird.
So they would build these giant mounds 

2300
01:48:52,441 --> 01:48:53,274
of dirt and then dig holes in him and 
support him like they would be doing 

2301
01:48:56,260 --> 01:48:57,093
inside.
They created the interior subterranean 

2302
01:48:59,551 --> 01:49:00,384
as they were building the whole thing 
over it and they just stacked dirt on 

2303
01:49:03,151 --> 01:49:03,720
top of it.

2304
01:49:03,720 --> 01:49:04,560
Yeah.
Wow.

2305
01:49:04,561 --> 01:49:06,430
What a weird way to make a house.
Yeah.

2306
01:49:06,570 --> 01:49:08,370
And then we have to consider this with,
you know,

2307
01:49:08,371 --> 01:49:09,204
with,
with archeological sites all all around 

2308
01:49:11,101 --> 01:49:15,090
the world is that any site may actually 
not be the product of just one culture,

2309
01:49:15,091 --> 01:49:18,330
but may have been reworked and worked 
over and used by many different cultures

2310
01:49:18,331 --> 01:49:20,100
over this,
any different periods.

2311
01:49:20,220 --> 01:49:21,840
Stunning to me.
Um,

2312
01:49:21,841 --> 01:49:25,020
I found out about this because of a 
friend of John Anthony West who was here

2313
01:49:25,021 --> 01:49:25,890
with him.
He showed me,

2314
01:49:25,891 --> 01:49:28,500
he lives in China and he showed me some 
video of it and I was like,

2315
01:49:28,501 --> 01:49:31,080
how do I not know about this?
I had no idea.

2316
01:49:31,081 --> 01:49:32,070
There's this many of them.
Also.

2317
01:49:32,100 --> 01:49:37,100
Here's one that's exposed was this 
controversial ancient pyramids of China.

2318
01:49:38,250 --> 01:49:41,220
That one looks blocky.
Yeah.

2319
01:49:41,320 --> 01:49:42,900
Yeah.
Well that is a,

2320
01:49:42,901 --> 01:49:46,800
another thing about China that we just 
don't have a clue.

2321
01:49:47,600 --> 01:49:48,140
When we,
when

2322
01:49:48,140 --> 01:49:50,990
we think about the,
the age and scale of things,

2323
01:49:51,730 --> 01:49:54,080
we're so silly.
We've only been around since,

2324
01:49:54,081 --> 01:49:54,914
you know,
the 1776 is when the country was 

2325
01:49:56,481 --> 01:49:58,310
established.
It's not really that long ago.

2326
01:49:58,580 --> 01:49:59,413
You're dealing with China.
You're dealing with literally thousands 

2327
01:50:02,330 --> 01:50:03,163
of years of civilization all rising and 
falling and taking place and adapting 

2328
01:50:07,371 --> 01:50:12,371
and growing all in this one area.
It's still in our eyes in a lot of ways.

2329
01:50:13,071 --> 01:50:14,990
It's kind of behind,
right?

2330
01:50:15,170 --> 01:50:17,270
I mean,
they're behind environmentally.

2331
01:50:17,271 --> 01:50:19,040
They're behind when it comes to human 
rights.

2332
01:50:19,180 --> 01:50:20,013
Consider this.
The Portuguese in the late 14 hundreds 

2333
01:50:24,880 --> 01:50:25,713
have rounded the Cape of Good Hope and 
they've entered the Indian Ocean in 

2334
01:50:28,721 --> 01:50:29,554
their little ships.
They've entered the Indian Ocean and 

2335
01:50:31,991 --> 01:50:35,820
they actually establish a huge empire.
They go to Monica,

2336
01:50:35,830 --> 01:50:37,210
they go all over the place.
Okay.

2337
01:50:37,450 --> 01:50:40,990
The seas are open to them.
If they had come 40 years earlier,

2338
01:50:41,170 --> 01:50:42,003
they would have encountered the Chinese 
treasure ships ships that were 50 times 

2339
01:50:45,791 --> 01:50:49,920
larger than the little caravels that the
Portuguese were sailing in Varsha.

2340
01:50:49,921 --> 01:50:51,190
And know what the Chinese did at that 
time.

2341
01:50:51,191 --> 01:50:52,024
They went through a period where they 
felt they just wanted to give gifts to 

2342
01:50:54,641 --> 01:50:55,474
people and they put together these huge 
fleets carrying incredibly precious 

2343
01:50:59,141 --> 01:51:00,210
gifts,
silks and,

2344
01:51:00,380 --> 01:51:03,280
and ceramics.
And they took them all around the Indian

2345
01:51:03,280 --> 01:51:04,113
Ocean and they just gave them to people.
So off the coast of east Africa and in 

2346
01:51:07,181 --> 01:51:08,014
East Africa,
you can find remains of this pottery 

2347
01:51:09,610 --> 01:51:10,443
from this episode.
And then a Chinese emperor came along 

2348
01:51:13,750 --> 01:51:16,750
and he closed the doors and burned all 
the boats,

2349
01:51:16,840 --> 01:51:17,673
shut everything down,
and didn't let anybody speak to China 

2350
01:51:19,541 --> 01:51:21,130
for 200 years.
Wow.

2351
01:51:21,220 --> 01:51:22,053
What a Dick.

2352
01:51:23,040 --> 01:51:23,490
Well,
he,

2353
01:51:23,490 --> 01:51:26,550
he felt that it was time for the Chinese
culture to turn inward.

2354
01:51:26,730 --> 01:51:29,070
Yeah.
They were afraid that they were,

2355
01:51:29,160 --> 01:51:29,993
that their ancient culture on one,
and there might have been maybe a 

2356
01:51:32,641 --> 01:51:33,474
laudable motive in that they were 
concerned that the age had culture was 

2357
01:51:36,541 --> 01:51:37,374
going to get contaminated by too much 
contact with the generative cultures 

2358
01:51:41,701 --> 01:51:43,980
from other places.
And that was a factor in it.

2359
01:51:44,400 --> 01:51:49,400
The constant desire to maintain the 
current situation.

2360
01:51:50,200 --> 01:51:51,960
It's human.
We have to say it's some kind of,

2361
01:51:51,961 --> 01:51:52,794
some kind of human nature for sure.
I'd love to see some of these images of 

2362
01:51:55,721 --> 01:51:56,554
the,
of the crowd and stuff from the chemist 

2363
01:51:58,260 --> 01:52:00,660
that comes prairie at what,
what please,

2364
01:52:00,950 --> 01:52:02,430
unless let's,
let's have a look at it.

2365
01:52:02,431 --> 01:52:03,264
You've got that little carrier that this
Chinese parents are still blowing my 

2366
01:52:05,791 --> 01:52:07,590
mind.
They blow my mind as well.

2367
01:52:07,740 --> 01:52:09,240
I just can't believe that they haven't 
been asked.

2368
01:52:09,330 --> 01:52:11,160
It's an eerie,
spooky scene.

2369
01:52:11,161 --> 01:52:13,770
I'm at our recommended anybody to go to 
Seattle and I just,

2370
01:52:13,771 --> 01:52:14,604
I just,
it's incredible how many of them there 

2371
01:52:16,351 --> 01:52:17,530
are.
Um,

2372
01:52:17,700 --> 01:52:20,010
and how unexplained it all is.
And this again,

2373
01:52:20,011 --> 01:52:21,670
it feeds into my general point is we do,

2374
01:52:21,960 --> 01:52:24,030
I remember our past,
what are we looking at here?

2375
01:52:24,700 --> 01:52:26,190
Let's,
can we pause?

2376
01:52:26,310 --> 01:52:28,230
Sorry.
I can talk about what we're looking at.

2377
01:52:28,500 --> 01:52:29,370
Yeah.
You look at this one.

2378
01:52:29,371 --> 01:52:30,750
That way you can hit the mic right in 
front of you.

2379
01:52:30,930 --> 01:52:32,010
Okay.
This is the beginning of it.

2380
01:52:32,011 --> 01:52:32,490
Okay.
What were,

2381
01:52:32,490 --> 01:52:33,380
here's what we're looking at,
Mike,

2382
01:52:33,390 --> 01:52:34,223
right up to there.
We're looking at a place in western 

2383
01:52:36,391 --> 01:52:37,224
Montana called Khamish prairie,
and you'll see some hills in the 

2384
01:52:39,571 --> 01:52:42,060
foreground and you see a base and in the
background,

2385
01:52:42,570 --> 01:52:43,890
right?
Okay.

2386
01:52:44,220 --> 01:52:46,100
Right here on of this hill and down

2387
01:52:46,100 --> 01:52:46,933
on the side here,
you'll see that there are some coring 

2388
01:52:48,141 --> 01:52:48,974
operations.
Those are coring gravel because 

2389
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:52,033
everything you're looking at your,
this whole landscape between the hills 

2390
01:52:54,560 --> 01:52:58,820
are these large masses of gravel,
trillions of tons of gravel.

2391
01:52:59,930 --> 01:53:00,763
Now what we're gonna do is we're going 
to start sweeping around as the video 

2392
01:53:03,051 --> 01:53:03,884
plays,
and you're going to load us down here a 

2393
01:53:06,091 --> 01:53:08,870
series of ripples.
Oh,

2394
01:53:08,871 --> 01:53:09,710
okay.
I see that.

2395
01:53:09,860 --> 01:53:10,693
Okay.
And I'm going to have Jamie pause in a 

2396
01:53:11,841 --> 01:53:13,730
second,
but let's keep coming around.

2397
01:53:13,890 --> 01:53:16,160
Do you start seeing the ripples?
I am landscape.

2398
01:53:17,240 --> 01:53:20,390
Let's pause right there.
Right there.

2399
01:53:20,391 --> 01:53:21,224
Let's pause.
No,

2400
01:53:21,890 --> 01:53:24,560
I wish I had a pointer,
but if you look up,

2401
01:53:24,561 --> 01:53:26,450
you're going to see a flat piece of 
land,

2402
01:53:26,451 --> 01:53:29,030
like a tone coming out,
rounded out.

2403
01:53:29,060 --> 01:53:30,490
Jamie's uh,

2404
01:53:33,520 --> 01:53:34,353
right here.

2405
01:53:36,960 --> 01:53:38,310
That's it.
He gets you a laser.

2406
01:53:38,460 --> 01:53:40,740
That's a delta.
That's a delta.

2407
01:53:40,741 --> 01:53:44,340
You know what a Delta is?
You ever heard of the delta?

2408
01:53:44,341 --> 01:53:45,174
It's when the river comes into a body of
water and it's carrying sediment and 

2409
01:53:48,601 --> 01:53:50,880
because the river is moving along 
swiftly,

2410
01:53:50,881 --> 01:53:53,850
it's carrying the sediment.
But when it comes into the standing body

2411
01:53:53,851 --> 01:53:54,684
of water,
it slows down and it drops its sediment 

2412
01:53:56,881 --> 01:53:59,760
had built a delta.
The whole city of Portland,

2413
01:53:59,761 --> 01:54:01,740
for example,
is built on a giant Delta.

2414
01:54:02,310 --> 01:54:04,680
Right?
New Orleans is built on a delta.

2415
01:54:05,160 --> 01:54:06,270
Right.
Okay,

2416
01:54:06,271 --> 01:54:09,120
so what we're seeing near as at Delta 
and then in front of it,

2417
01:54:09,150 --> 01:54:11,490
we're seeing rippled landscape.

2418
01:54:12,490 --> 01:54:12,970
Yeah.

2419
01:54:12,970 --> 01:54:15,640
Let's keep coming around Jamie and 
soulful landscaped.

2420
01:54:15,641 --> 01:54:17,950
It looks exactly like the beach looks.
Yeah,

2421
01:54:17,980 --> 01:54:20,800
keep coming around with this.
The thing is fractal because this,

2422
01:54:20,801 --> 01:54:21,634
this is the whole mystery of this,
that this happens at a scale of inches 

2423
01:54:24,101 --> 01:54:26,290
on beaches and the scale of hundreds of 
feet here.

2424
01:54:26,350 --> 01:54:27,970
Top again.
Lord,

2425
01:54:28,810 --> 01:54:29,643
right here in the middle you see a 
massive delta spewed out like a big 

2426
01:54:32,591 --> 01:54:33,424
tongue splayed out.
And then right down here you start 

2427
01:54:35,531 --> 01:54:38,280
seeing the ripples and there was a farm 
house.

2428
01:54:38,590 --> 01:54:39,423
You see the farmhouse there.
Now those ripples are the tallest ones 

2429
01:54:43,930 --> 01:54:46,120
are about the height of a five story 
building.

2430
01:54:46,780 --> 01:54:49,420
Whoa.
How bizarre.

2431
01:54:49,480 --> 01:54:50,261
Keep,
okay,

2432
01:54:50,261 --> 01:54:51,690
let's keep,
keep sweet.

2433
01:54:51,700 --> 01:54:53,200
Swinging around.
Stop it.

2434
01:54:53,230 --> 01:54:54,580
Stop this for a second.
Um,

2435
01:54:54,910 --> 01:54:55,960
if you don't mind.
No,

2436
01:54:55,961 --> 01:54:56,794
I don't see these things.
They're the size of a five story 

2437
01:54:58,151 --> 01:55:00,130
building.
What does that like 70 feet or something

2438
01:55:00,131 --> 01:55:00,640
like that?

2439
01:55:00,640 --> 01:55:01,600
50 feet.
Okay,

2440
01:55:01,960 --> 01:55:04,120
so that's,
those are 50 feet high.

2441
01:55:04,450 --> 01:55:07,210
And how much water we'll,
we'll get to that.

2442
01:55:08,110 --> 01:55:08,943
Let's see.
So let's see the rest of it and these 

2443
01:55:10,001 --> 01:55:12,110
are just dirt right there,
there.

2444
01:55:12,160 --> 01:55:13,720
Well,
if you dig into one,

2445
01:55:13,721 --> 01:55:16,060
what you're going to find is there are,
there are a massive,

2446
01:55:16,540 --> 01:55:18,550
okay,
let's pause the game.

2447
01:55:19,090 --> 01:55:21,010
Look at this.
This is crazy.

2448
01:55:21,070 --> 01:55:21,903
This is totally crazy.
This is one of the craziest things 

2449
01:55:23,621 --> 01:55:24,454
you'll ever see.
These ripples repeated ripples in an 

2450
01:55:28,091 --> 01:55:31,180
area where there's nothing else like it.
This is the fingerprints of the flood.

2451
01:55:31,420 --> 01:55:34,090
That's what it is.
Wow.

2452
01:55:34,490 --> 01:55:38,050
Where can someone look at this?
How does someone look at this in real?

2453
01:55:38,200 --> 01:55:39,033
You know this right now.
This is what we're looking at this as 

2454
01:55:40,501 --> 01:55:42,280
this video.
Um,

2455
01:55:42,490 --> 01:55:44,100
well my colleague

2456
01:55:44,100 --> 01:55:48,480
Brad Young did this with his drone.
Um,

2457
01:55:48,481 --> 01:55:49,314
and I think he's got it on the website.
Geo Cosmic rex is being played in the 

2458
01:55:52,291 --> 01:55:53,550
youtube video right now.
Okay.

2459
01:55:53,660 --> 01:55:55,980
All right.
So the youtube people are cool with it.

2460
01:55:55,981 --> 01:55:58,470
If you're listening on Itunes,
find it,

2461
01:55:59,130 --> 01:56:01,290
find it on youtube,
but it's worth looking at it.

2462
01:56:01,291 --> 01:56:02,370
It's what my point,
this is,

2463
01:56:02,371 --> 01:56:03,960
um,
this is mind blowing shit.

2464
01:56:04,390 --> 01:56:05,880
I think you made the crucial point,
Joe,

2465
01:56:05,890 --> 01:56:06,723
which is,
which is that we can understand what 

2466
01:56:08,161 --> 01:56:10,260
this is because we can see it on any 
beach.

2467
01:56:10,261 --> 01:56:11,094
We can see how water flows receding 
across a sandy medium will produce 

2468
01:56:15,420 --> 01:56:16,253
ripples.
But here they're on this unbelievable 

2469
01:56:18,781 --> 01:56:21,570
scale where they're hundreds of feet 
long and 50 feet high,

2470
01:56:21,571 --> 01:56:24,410
where they dwarf houses and they're 
lying all across.

2471
01:56:24,430 --> 01:56:25,263
And that to what that tells us is that a
huge waterflow went across this plane 

2472
01:56:28,620 --> 01:56:29,520
and did this.

2473
01:56:29,670 --> 01:56:32,110
You will seeing it from this perspective
above,

2474
01:56:32,160 --> 01:56:34,800
which is a rare perspective,
unless you're in a plane or a helicopter

2475
01:56:34,801 --> 01:56:37,260
or something,
you get a chance to look at it this way.

2476
01:56:37,261 --> 01:56:39,060
You really get a better sense of what it
is.

2477
01:56:39,061 --> 01:56:40,860
If you are on the ground there,
you'd probably say,

2478
01:56:40,861 --> 01:56:41,694
Oh,
look at all the hills taught to say 

2479
01:56:42,930 --> 01:56:45,050
quite get the impression are we did 
visit this,

2480
01:56:45,240 --> 01:56:46,590
this location.
Um,

2481
01:56:46,850 --> 01:56:47,371
and,
and,

2482
01:56:47,371 --> 01:56:48,204
and to that day it was overcast.
So you don't quite get the effect like 

2483
01:56:51,091 --> 01:56:55,010
you do when you've got low sun angle 
really helps you to see what,

2484
01:56:55,040 --> 01:56:56,910
what,
what's going on in the landscape.

2485
01:56:56,940 --> 01:56:58,920
Can I ask you,
is there a dispute to this?

2486
01:56:58,921 --> 01:57:00,750
Is there no,
no.

2487
01:57:00,780 --> 01:57:03,990
Nobody disputes it.
Nobody knows from a flood.

2488
01:57:04,050 --> 01:57:05,640
Not Anymore.
Wow.

2489
01:57:05,820 --> 01:57:06,451
No.
In fact,

2490
01:57:06,451 --> 01:57:10,080
it was this j t party,
nobody disputes that.

2491
01:57:10,081 --> 01:57:12,120
It was caused by massive waterflows.

2492
01:57:12,670 --> 01:57:13,503
Those same people would still not buy 
into the notion that there was this one 

2493
01:57:16,141 --> 01:57:17,130
humongous flood.
Okay.

2494
01:57:17,131 --> 01:57:19,500
So they think it's an accumulative 
effect,

2495
01:57:19,501 --> 01:57:22,020
but that this was all created towards 
the bottom of Lake Missoula,

2496
01:57:22,021 --> 01:57:23,020
right?
Yeah.

2497
01:57:23,220 --> 01:57:26,490
And this was supposed to actually 
represent the draining of lake missoula.

2498
01:57:26,670 --> 01:57:27,503
Right.
Whereas I argue from a number of 

2499
01:57:29,221 --> 01:57:31,970
different reasons that this is the 
filling missoula.

2500
01:57:32,160 --> 01:57:34,320
I have a friend of mine who,
uh,

2501
01:57:34,350 --> 01:57:37,710
his friend lives in Montana and they 
found a dinosaur on his ranch.

2502
01:57:37,830 --> 01:57:38,820
Allow,
yeah.

2503
01:57:38,821 --> 01:57:41,550
Like really recently.
That's a nice thing to find.

2504
01:57:41,610 --> 01:57:43,830
We should come back to that because 
there's a connection here.

2505
01:57:43,840 --> 01:57:44,250
Yeah.
The,

2506
01:57:44,250 --> 01:57:45,810
well,
the Great Western inland sea,

2507
01:57:45,811 --> 01:57:47,100
all that,
that area there was,

2508
01:57:47,160 --> 01:57:49,890
I mean this is a crazy place at one 
point in time.

2509
01:57:50,010 --> 01:57:53,310
It's still is,
I'll give it a different way.

2510
01:57:54,440 --> 01:57:56,130
The water here,
Joe,

2511
01:57:56,190 --> 01:57:59,160
that did this,
the way to visualize this is to again,

2512
01:57:59,161 --> 01:58:00,630
begin to think a tsunami.

2513
01:58:00,870 --> 01:58:01,703
You have to think tsunami because it's a
tsunami is the closest scale of water 

2514
01:58:05,531 --> 01:58:07,920
flow that we've experienced in,
in modern times.

2515
01:58:07,921 --> 01:58:12,270
No river flood.
His even approached this,

2516
01:58:12,320 --> 01:58:12,740
right?
No,

2517
01:58:12,740 --> 01:58:13,870
no,
no flooding,

2518
01:58:13,871 --> 01:58:14,704
any flood plain,
nothing that we can put into 

2519
01:58:15,901 --> 01:58:17,640
perspective.
The closest,

2520
01:58:17,760 --> 01:58:20,220
the closest we can get to it as this is 
a tsunami,

2521
01:58:20,490 --> 01:58:21,323
but even there you got to picture the 
tsunamis that we've experienced in the 

2522
01:58:25,020 --> 01:58:26,970
last decade and a half and you know in,
in Indonesia,

2523
01:58:26,971 --> 01:58:27,804
in Japan when they made landfall,
both tsunamis were roughly between 20 

2524
01:58:31,471 --> 01:58:36,090
and 50 feet depending on where you were 
relative to the,

2525
01:58:36,120 --> 01:58:38,850
to the oncoming wave and how far 
distance you were from it.

2526
01:58:39,270 --> 01:58:42,550
Here what you have to visualize is a 
tsunami

2527
01:58:42,580 --> 01:58:45,610
sweeping over the land that's over a 
thousand feet deep.

2528
01:58:46,390 --> 01:58:48,220
That's,
that's what happened here.

2529
01:58:49,210 --> 01:58:51,400
And we know that because we can trace 
the,

2530
01:58:51,460 --> 01:58:52,293
the,
the high water marks on the hillsides 

2531
01:58:54,040 --> 01:58:54,873
are clearly left.
The high water marks are clearly etched 

2532
01:58:57,311 --> 01:58:59,050
into the,
into the hillsides.

2533
01:58:59,440 --> 01:59:04,270
So we now know based upon the study of 
the ripples in the water here was moving

2534
01:59:04,420 --> 01:59:05,253
down,
it's filling this base and it's rushing 

2535
01:59:07,331 --> 01:59:11,800
in and a great tsunami from the north of
freshwater melt water coming off the ice

2536
01:59:11,801 --> 01:59:14,470
sheet and it's sweeping down over this 
land.

2537
01:59:14,471 --> 01:59:17,980
It probably two or 300 million cubic 
feet per second,

2538
01:59:18,010 --> 01:59:20,620
which is an inconceivable amount of 
water.

2539
01:59:21,010 --> 01:59:25,060
It's,
it's many times in excess of every river

2540
01:59:25,510 --> 01:59:28,240
flowing on earth flowing today all at 
once.

2541
01:59:28,270 --> 01:59:30,340
It's,
it's beyond that many times,

2542
01:59:30,610 --> 01:59:31,443
10 or 20 times beyond that one of the 
trip you're things about water is that 

2543
01:59:34,811 --> 01:59:36,250
water in in itself?

2544
01:59:36,250 --> 01:59:38,230
It's kind of fractal on some sort of a 
weird way.

2545
01:59:38,231 --> 01:59:39,340
When you look at the,
the,

2546
01:59:39,430 --> 01:59:42,100
the actual molecules of water,
it's almost like we don't do,

2547
01:59:42,120 --> 01:59:42,953
we don't distinguish it as being a 
fractal thing cause we see it as like 

2548
01:59:45,220 --> 01:59:46,053
this moving flowing.
But if you're looking at the actual 

2549
01:59:47,441 --> 01:59:51,340
molecules of water,
a cup of water with that,

2550
01:59:51,341 --> 01:59:54,820
you dip your fingers in,
which is seemingly completely innocuous,

2551
01:59:55,150 --> 01:59:55,983
becomes this massive element of change.
When the volume is a thousand feet high 

2552
02:00:02,381 --> 02:00:06,010
and it's rolling over with massive 
amounts of weight behind them,

2553
02:00:06,190 --> 02:00:08,620
it's that same stuff.
Massive amounts of weight,

2554
02:00:08,621 --> 02:00:09,454
enough enough voice that it's actually 
causing seismic responses in only 

2555
02:00:14,590 --> 02:00:16,670
imagine how much weight are you talking 
about?

2556
02:00:16,671 --> 02:00:19,270
Let's get can create these 50 foot high 
walls.

2557
02:00:19,510 --> 02:00:23,560
But this what's fascinating to me is 
that we don't have,

2558
02:00:23,730 --> 02:00:24,563
we,
we don't have a scale like in our minds 

2559
02:00:26,441 --> 02:00:27,274
as a reference,
like the difference between that Little 

2560
02:00:29,230 --> 02:00:32,470
Cup and these gigantic waves that,
uh,

2561
02:00:32,471 --> 02:00:33,304
you,
you see that a surfer's a travel by jet 

2562
02:00:35,531 --> 02:00:36,520
ski to get to,
you know,

2563
02:00:36,521 --> 02:00:38,140
the off of a,
uh,

2564
02:00:38,180 --> 02:00:39,460
I believe it's Mexico,
right?

2565
02:00:39,460 --> 02:00:41,980
You ever seen those massive ways they go
way out,

2566
02:00:41,981 --> 02:00:45,160
miles out to get to these crazy waves 
and we ride them in that like 60,

2567
02:00:45,161 --> 02:00:46,990
70 feet high.
Like that's,

2568
02:00:47,110 --> 02:00:47,943
that's the comparison.
Almost like a glass of water to those 

2569
02:00:50,561 --> 02:00:53,440
waves.
And then that to this scales up,

2570
02:00:53,470 --> 02:00:54,303
it scales up,
it scales up and at a certain point it 

2571
02:00:55,961 --> 02:00:56,794
can change.
The whole story of civilization almost 

2572
02:00:58,541 --> 02:01:01,120
doesn't compute.
You can intellectualize it,

2573
02:01:01,121 --> 02:01:01,954
but it's almost not computing.
One of these flood flows here is three 

2574
02:01:05,111 --> 02:01:10,000
orders of magnitude greater than the 
largest measured modern flood.

2575
02:01:10,390 --> 02:01:11,223
In other words,
over a thousand times greater in terms 

2576
02:01:13,571 --> 02:01:14,404
of peak discharge or volume,
you would have to scale up at least a 

2577
02:01:18,880 --> 02:01:23,880
thousand times greater than any modern 
measured flood to get to the smallest.

2578
02:01:24,461 --> 02:01:27,130
Really of these flows here cause this 
is,

2579
02:01:27,370 --> 02:01:28,203
this is just one re one place,
one locale of an five states where you 

2580
02:01:33,311 --> 02:01:35,560
can trace the,
the literally the,

2581
02:01:35,561 --> 02:01:36,394
the uh,
an ocean of fresh water sweeping across 

2582
02:01:38,771 --> 02:01:40,460
the Pacific northwest.

2583
02:01:41,300 --> 02:01:43,310
Pretty much washing away anything that 
was there.

2584
02:01:43,530 --> 02:01:44,363
It's almost like we have a defense 
mechanism built in where we ignore how 

2585
02:01:48,961 --> 02:01:49,794
vulnerable we really are.
Like we put it maybe that's one of the 

2586
02:01:52,021 --> 02:01:52,854
reasons why people are so reluctant to 
really go deep into studying asteroidal 

2587
02:01:55,411 --> 02:01:56,730
impacts.
I think it was,

2588
02:01:56,880 --> 02:01:59,220
or even to pay attention to this,
stuff like that.

2589
02:01:59,221 --> 02:02:00,054
This could happen and this is,
I mean it does enough to separate 

2590
02:02:03,841 --> 02:02:06,780
subjects because this is the result of 
the comment impact on the,

2591
02:02:06,781 --> 02:02:07,800
on the ice cap.
This is,

2592
02:02:08,280 --> 02:02:09,113
this is the,
this is why I feel that the research in 

2593
02:02:11,311 --> 02:02:12,600
this field is so vital.

2594
02:02:12,640 --> 02:02:13,473
Okay.
Right there.

2595
02:02:13,960 --> 02:02:15,460
Yeah.
Now here,

2596
02:02:15,580 --> 02:02:17,560
notice this is Craig.
That's a beach.

2597
02:02:19,270 --> 02:02:20,103
It's a beach.
It's a beach for giant monsters is what 

2598
02:02:22,421 --> 02:02:23,254
it is.
You can see in this here that you've 

2599
02:02:25,181 --> 02:02:28,720
actually got three massive currents 
converging here.

2600
02:02:29,380 --> 02:02:30,213
Do you see that over here on the right,
you've got a massive current coming in 

2601
02:02:33,610 --> 02:02:37,390
that would be uh,
from the west and then we're standing.

2602
02:02:37,420 --> 02:02:40,930
We would be standing looking down 
current of course this,

2603
02:02:40,990 --> 02:02:41,740
the,
um,

2604
02:02:41,740 --> 02:02:45,520
the drone I'm guessing here is about 200
feet in elevation.

2605
02:02:45,940 --> 02:02:50,940
So the top of the water was another 
eight to 900 feet above this perspective

2606
02:02:51,521 --> 02:02:52,354
right here and it's moving very,
very fast and it's sweeping down into a 

2607
02:02:57,431 --> 02:03:01,000
river valley that's down in those 
mountains you see in the distance.

2608
02:03:01,480 --> 02:03:02,313
And from there it's being carried down 
in joining up other equally as large 

2609
02:03:05,591 --> 02:03:10,420
floods coming in from other valleys.
And all of this is happening at once and

2610
02:03:10,421 --> 02:03:11,254
it's covering five states basically.
And that's just one region that's being 

2611
02:03:15,941 --> 02:03:19,060
affected by this sudden catastrophic 
melting of the ice sheet.

2612
02:03:19,260 --> 02:03:21,780
They are dealing with the largest flood 
that ever occurred on earth.

2613
02:03:21,810 --> 02:03:22,670
It's the simplest,
yeah,

2614
02:03:22,920 --> 02:03:24,540
this is insane.
I mean,

2615
02:03:24,541 --> 02:03:25,374
it's insane.
Look at just how large here in North 

2616
02:03:26,461 --> 02:03:27,294
America and it happened 12,800
years ago and it's story has yet to be 

2617
02:03:32,431 --> 02:03:35,520
fully told isn't impossible.
There was something larger before,

2618
02:03:35,521 --> 02:03:38,760
like a the 65 million year ago,
one that hit the Yucatan.

2619
02:03:38,761 --> 02:03:39,930
Like what?
You know,

2620
02:03:40,110 --> 02:03:42,580
what kind of an impact did that have?
Well it actually,

2621
02:03:42,810 --> 02:03:45,420
cause if,
if different kind of happened 12,000

2622
02:03:45,421 --> 02:03:46,680
years ago,
we wouldn't be having,

2623
02:03:46,681 --> 02:03:48,300
none of us would.
Yeah,

2624
02:03:48,301 --> 02:03:49,230
that'd be a wrap,
right?

2625
02:03:49,231 --> 02:03:50,064
Yeah.
That was a single lodge objective about 

2626
02:03:52,021 --> 02:03:54,390
six miles wide.
That was,

2627
02:03:54,420 --> 02:03:59,040
that was a much more devastating impact 
then the impact of 12,800

2628
02:03:59,041 --> 02:04:00,720
years ago,
but nevertheless,

2629
02:04:00,721 --> 02:04:03,750
those impacts of 12,800
years ago were really,

2630
02:04:03,780 --> 02:04:04,613
really bad and they did stuff like this 
and anything that was in the way of 

2631
02:04:07,291 --> 02:04:08,124
this,
of these massive flows of water would 

2632
02:04:10,160 --> 02:04:12,690
have been rubbed completely from the 
story.

2633
02:04:13,150 --> 02:04:14,160
He makes sense.

2634
02:04:14,510 --> 02:04:16,760
Here's the thing that the Michael 
Shermer is don't get,

2635
02:04:17,300 --> 02:04:18,133
when you understand the extent of this,
the scale of this phenomena in the 

2636
02:04:21,291 --> 02:04:22,124
severity,
the inconceivable severity of this in 

2637
02:04:25,971 --> 02:04:30,210
the aftermath of an event like this,
what would remain of a,

2638
02:04:30,570 --> 02:04:32,000
of a city of Villi

2639
02:04:32,250 --> 02:04:33,990
refrigerator?
No,

2640
02:04:34,110 --> 02:04:36,340
not a goddamn thing.
Nothing.

2641
02:04:36,930 --> 02:04:40,680
Nothing would exist in the aftermath of 
this and most things wouldn't exist.

2642
02:04:40,681 --> 02:04:41,514
I mean,
you find like an old refrigerator or a 

2643
02:04:42,601 --> 02:04:46,490
car up on blocks and someone's backyard 
and the south and it seemed good.

2644
02:04:46,491 --> 02:04:50,670
1970s in the the,
the rot has gotten into a frame.

2645
02:04:51,010 --> 02:04:51,843
The H is going to eat it.
Nature's eating it up just in a couple 

2646
02:04:54,570 --> 02:04:55,140
of decades.
Right.

2647
02:04:55,140 --> 02:04:56,910
What's it going to be like in a couple 
of thousand years?

2648
02:04:57,730 --> 02:05:01,710
It should not be surprised about how 
little we really know about our pos.

2649
02:05:01,740 --> 02:05:03,410
This is also a comfort game,
but our kill,

2650
02:05:03,430 --> 02:05:05,160
oh yeah,
we've got the past all worked out.

2651
02:05:05,161 --> 02:05:07,380
We understand it.
Here is what we teach in schools.

2652
02:05:07,590 --> 02:05:09,630
This is what our friends in the media 
report.

2653
02:05:09,920 --> 02:05:11,250
This is the fat.
It's not the fence.

2654
02:05:11,251 --> 02:05:12,700
We know nothing.
It's there's,

2655
02:05:12,701 --> 02:05:13,534
there's been so much lost,
so many missing pieces of the puzzle 

2656
02:05:16,500 --> 02:05:17,350
that we're,
you know,

2657
02:05:17,430 --> 02:05:20,130
desperately trying to stitch together 
and it's important.

2658
02:05:20,310 --> 02:05:21,143
I think that we actually do get some 
clarity on events like this because we 

2659
02:05:25,231 --> 02:05:26,064
still live on this planet and we have 
kids and we have a future and we want 

2660
02:05:28,981 --> 02:05:30,000
to,
we want to,

2661
02:05:30,001 --> 02:05:32,370
hopefully we wanted one of those big 
boys comes our way.

2662
02:05:32,410 --> 02:05:33,810
Well that's right.
But again,

2663
02:05:33,811 --> 02:05:35,550
I come,
I come down to this,

2664
02:05:35,551 --> 02:05:36,384
which is,
which is that we are not dealing with 

2665
02:05:38,461 --> 02:05:39,294
gloom and doom and the end of the world.
We're dealing with a problem that 

2666
02:05:42,061 --> 02:05:42,894
humanity should be confronting.
We should not be sticking our heads in 

2667
02:05:44,911 --> 02:05:47,670
the sand.
We should be confronting this problem.

2668
02:05:47,970 --> 02:05:48,803
And that's why I support the work of the
comment research group because they are 

2669
02:05:51,181 --> 02:05:53,880
the only people right now who are 
confronting this problem.

2670
02:05:53,881 --> 02:05:56,160
And really getting to grips with it.
We should all confront,

2671
02:05:56,220 --> 02:05:57,053
I mean,
we should absolutely all support them 

2672
02:05:58,471 --> 02:06:01,830
and confront it because this,
if something like this can happen once,

2673
02:06:02,070 --> 02:06:02,903
what's,
but what really makes sense is how many 

2674
02:06:04,501 --> 02:06:05,334
stories of floods there are an ancient 
times and how many parallels there are 

2675
02:06:09,540 --> 02:06:12,630
there are and how many there are from 
North America?

2676
02:06:13,370 --> 02:06:14,120
Dozens.

2677
02:06:14,120 --> 02:06:14,821
Dozens.
Yeah.

2678
02:06:14,821 --> 02:06:15,690
It was the,
um,

2679
02:06:16,120 --> 02:06:17,430
Caitlyn,
um,

2680
02:06:17,910 --> 02:06:22,110
the Indian artist who spent 30 years or 
so pre civil war,

2681
02:06:22,111 --> 02:06:22,944
I think maybe a decade after the civil 
war painting Indians of different 

2682
02:06:25,981 --> 02:06:28,460
tribes.
And he wrote a book called last rambled.

2683
02:06:28,461 --> 02:06:30,540
So amongst the North American Indians.
Very,

2684
02:06:30,570 --> 02:06:31,403
very interesting book.
But what really is interesting to me 

2685
02:06:33,181 --> 02:06:36,450
when I read the book years and years ago
was his final conclusion of the book.

2686
02:06:36,451 --> 02:06:38,730
He says,
after all of these different customs and

2687
02:06:38,731 --> 02:06:41,130
traditions that have been handed down 
amongst these tribes,

2688
02:06:41,640 --> 02:06:42,473
they all have one thing in common.
They all have a memory or a story of a 

2689
02:06:44,701 --> 02:06:48,150
gigantic world destroying flood.
And he and he,

2690
02:06:48,300 --> 02:06:51,630
this is included tribes down into 
Central America that he visits.

2691
02:06:51,630 --> 02:06:52,040
It did,

2692
02:06:52,040 --> 02:06:52,873
I believe the Americas are the 
repository that the native American 

2693
02:06:56,691 --> 02:07:01,310
peoples who have been subjected to so 
much destruction over the years,

2694
02:07:01,730 --> 02:07:03,770
they,
in their mythology,

2695
02:07:03,771 --> 02:07:05,150
their traditions,
their memories,

2696
02:07:05,151 --> 02:07:07,730
they keep more of this than almost 
anybody else.

2697
02:07:07,760 --> 02:07:08,541
It's,
it's re,

2698
02:07:08,541 --> 02:07:09,374
it's really tragic what has happened in 
the Americas from the time of the 

2699
02:07:11,451 --> 02:07:12,284
Spanish conquest,
the deliberate destruction of knowledge 

2700
02:07:14,841 --> 02:07:15,180
that,
that,

2701
02:07:15,180 --> 02:07:16,013
that the terrible,
horrendous abuses that native American 

2702
02:07:18,171 --> 02:07:20,540
people suffered.
They are our wisdom keepers.

2703
02:07:20,541 --> 02:07:24,110
They are the people who pass down the 
oral tradition and remembered the past.

2704
02:07:24,111 --> 02:07:27,740
So not only do we have cataclysms wiping
the human memory,

2705
02:07:27,890 --> 02:07:31,670
but we ourselves actively get involved 
in the human memory and wipe it.

2706
02:07:31,880 --> 02:07:32,713
We rub it out,
the burning of the Maya courtesies by 

2707
02:07:34,521 --> 02:07:36,190
the Spanish thousands and

2708
02:07:36,190 --> 02:07:38,620
thousand God knows what was in those 
documents.

2709
02:07:39,040 --> 02:07:39,873
You know,
we might have had a whole other story 

2710
02:07:41,261 --> 02:07:43,360
about ourselves if we could have had 
access to those,

2711
02:07:43,361 --> 02:07:44,194
but instead,
where this destructive cannibalistic 

2712
02:07:45,581 --> 02:07:49,510
species that just goes and dismisses 
everything to bits,

2713
02:07:49,760 --> 02:07:50,593
it's a weird impulse that human beings 
have is when they move into an era and 

2714
02:07:52,941 --> 02:07:55,670
they take over at one of the things they
like to do is destroy their icons,

2715
02:07:55,671 --> 02:07:59,340
destroy everything that's going on with 
Isis and all these ancient Buddhist sort

2716
02:07:59,341 --> 02:08:01,730
of structures.
Thousand plus year old,

2717
02:08:01,731 --> 02:08:04,490
beautiful sculptures obsolete and 
they're blowing them up.

2718
02:08:04,720 --> 02:08:06,350
You know?
And and yelling,

2719
02:08:06,351 --> 02:08:09,710
praise God while they're doing it.
It's really very bizarre.

2720
02:08:09,711 --> 02:08:11,380
It's a very bizarre inclination that we 
have,

2721
02:08:11,381 --> 02:08:13,970
but it's so,
it's almost like we don't want people to

2722
02:08:13,971 --> 02:08:15,110
know,
you know,

2723
02:08:15,111 --> 02:08:16,190
it's,
it's a bizarre,

2724
02:08:16,191 --> 02:08:17,024
almost human instinct to wipe out the 
past and just to constantly keep moving 

2725
02:08:21,171 --> 02:08:22,340
forward.
There's some trauma.

2726
02:08:22,341 --> 02:08:24,450
Is there some collective trauma,
some deeply,

2727
02:08:24,560 --> 02:08:28,490
deeply suppressed memory?
Could be that we can't quite confront.

2728
02:08:28,730 --> 02:08:30,860
That's,
that's exactly the thought I had because

2729
02:08:30,861 --> 02:08:31,694
I think that that's the one way,
one of those areas where Vela Lucovsky 

2730
02:08:34,371 --> 02:08:35,204
finally really nailed it,
was mankind in Amnesia that somehow we 

2731
02:08:38,991 --> 02:08:42,140
carry this,
the trump cause once you begin to get,

2732
02:08:42,440 --> 02:08:46,370
get a handle and you get to get the 
picture of these events as they occurred

2733
02:08:46,400 --> 02:08:49,520
and did occur and would have been 
experienced by our ancestors,

2734
02:08:50,330 --> 02:08:51,163
you've got to understand what would it 
be like to see your entire world 

2735
02:08:54,170 --> 02:08:55,003
completely obliterated starting over 
again from basically a bear and mud 

2736
02:08:58,971 --> 02:08:59,804
field.

2737
02:09:01,550 --> 02:09:04,340
That's essentially what these people 
were faced if they lived at all.

2738
02:09:04,341 --> 02:09:07,160
And so few probably did because here we 
are.

2739
02:09:07,161 --> 02:09:08,630
But you know,
again,

2740
02:09:08,631 --> 02:09:11,570
the evidence is emerging of major 
cultural collapse.

2741
02:09:11,600 --> 02:09:12,433
If you had a guess,
what percentage of the population of 

2742
02:09:14,511 --> 02:09:16,730
human beings,
just as obviously just to gas,

2743
02:09:16,731 --> 02:09:18,200
but how many do you think were wiped 
out?

2744
02:09:19,430 --> 02:09:21,710
Half of them.
Three quarters of them.

2745
02:09:21,740 --> 02:09:23,690
I don't think that would be unrealistic.
No,

2746
02:09:23,740 --> 02:09:24,573
it doesn't seem like it would be.
And if it was that number and those 

2747
02:09:26,991 --> 02:09:29,300
people,
that's enough for people to survive.

2748
02:09:29,660 --> 02:09:31,310
And if it was that number,
boy,

2749
02:09:31,311 --> 02:09:35,030
what a strange fucking mythical past.

2750
02:09:35,920 --> 02:09:38,980
The other thing to bear in mind is in 
the world today,

2751
02:09:39,100 --> 02:09:41,740
our world,
we have an advanced civilization.

2752
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:44,020
America,
you know,

2753
02:09:44,140 --> 02:09:44,973
Germany,
the industrialized technological 

2754
02:09:47,501 --> 02:09:48,334
countries,
and we have coexisting with them in 

2755
02:09:50,651 --> 02:09:53,010
South America,
in the the,

2756
02:09:53,050 --> 02:09:54,550
the,
the Namibian desert,

2757
02:09:54,551 --> 02:09:56,560
we have hunter gatherers.
So the,

2758
02:09:56,561 --> 02:09:57,394
the notion that hunter gatherers and an 
advanced civilization might coexist in 

2759
02:10:02,201 --> 02:10:03,034
the same epoch of history should not be 
strange to us because we are doing that 

2760
02:10:05,801 --> 02:10:08,530
today.
And that's what I would suggest happened

2761
02:10:08,920 --> 02:10:12,730
before 12,800
years ago before the cataclysm of 12,800

2762
02:10:12,731 --> 02:10:13,564
years ago,
that there was a fairly advanced 

2763
02:10:15,311 --> 02:10:18,070
civilization that was capable of mapping
and exploring the world,

2764
02:10:18,670 --> 02:10:19,503
creating gigantic works of architecture 
and it coexisted with hunter gatherers 

2765
02:10:23,680 --> 02:10:26,650
and who were the ones who survived the 
catechism?

2766
02:10:27,160 --> 02:10:30,850
The answer is the ones who survived the 
cataclysm where the hunter gatherers,

2767
02:10:31,180 --> 02:10:32,013
not the sophisticated peoples.
A few of them survived and they then 

2768
02:10:34,581 --> 02:10:35,414
settled amongst the hunter gatherers and
tried to transfer some of their 

2769
02:10:37,791 --> 02:10:40,760
knowledge and skills to them and it's 
the same today.

2770
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:41,833
If we,
if we were to have a repeat of the 

2771
02:10:43,731 --> 02:10:44,564
younger dryas cataclysm today,
I don't think that people from Los 

2772
02:10:48,560 --> 02:10:51,200
Angeles or London would be amongst the 
leading survivors.

2773
02:10:51,380 --> 02:10:52,213
I think the survivors would be people 
like the hunter gatherers of the Amazon 

2774
02:10:54,561 --> 02:10:57,410
rain forest because they are in the 
business of surviving.

2775
02:10:57,680 --> 02:10:59,660
That's what they do.
It's not a mystery to them.

2776
02:10:59,810 --> 02:11:01,310
It's not even a problem.
They do it.

2777
02:11:01,311 --> 02:11:03,290
They do it all the time.
They would,

2778
02:11:03,320 --> 02:11:06,830
they would carry the human story forward
and 10,000

2779
02:11:06,831 --> 02:11:07,664
years from now,
their descendants would be telling a 

2780
02:11:09,531 --> 02:11:10,364
myth about how there was once a great 
civilization on this planet so advanced 

2781
02:11:14,660 --> 02:11:18,980
that they could even go to the moon.
They could fly around the planet,

2782
02:11:18,981 --> 02:11:21,590
they could speak to one another on other
sides of the earth,

2783
02:11:22,310 --> 02:11:23,990
but they did something wrong.
They,

2784
02:11:23,991 --> 02:11:26,480
they fell out of harmony with the 
universe.

2785
02:11:26,480 --> 02:11:29,270
They ceased to where their prosperity 
with moderation.

2786
02:11:29,271 --> 02:11:31,640
That's actually a line from Plato about 
Atlantis.

2787
02:11:31,660 --> 02:11:34,190
Wow.
And the universe slap them down.

2788
02:11:35,030 --> 02:11:38,030
So there would be a differential 
survival rate.

2789
02:11:38,060 --> 02:11:38,893
Those who were,
I would say that those who are more 

2790
02:11:40,311 --> 02:11:41,144
technologically advanced or less likely 
to survive because they depend on a 

2791
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:44,833
complex,
interrelated network of skills and any 

2792
02:11:47,931 --> 02:11:50,630
individual on his or her own,
most of them.

2793
02:11:50,631 --> 02:11:52,600
But you are different Joe,
because you do know how to survive.

2794
02:11:52,700 --> 02:11:54,710
But a lot of people don't know how to 
survive,

2795
02:11:55,010 --> 02:11:58,730
how to survive.
I'd most likely you've worked at it,

2796
02:11:58,731 --> 02:12:00,140
you know,
I'm not that good at it,

2797
02:12:00,170 --> 02:12:01,003
but most of us,
most of us haven't even worked out at 

2798
02:12:02,281 --> 02:12:03,350
the time.
We haven't got a clue.

2799
02:12:03,351 --> 02:12:06,050
Let me fucking open everybody's eyes to 
all these people that think the,

2800
02:12:06,070 --> 02:12:08,330
you could just go out there and shoot 
animals and stay alive.

2801
02:12:08,570 --> 02:12:10,910
Good fucking luck.
You're,

2802
02:12:10,940 --> 02:12:13,370
you're probably screwed if you have a 
rifle.

2803
02:12:13,400 --> 02:12:15,200
Even if you have a rifle,
you're probably screwed.

2804
02:12:15,201 --> 02:12:17,420
If you have a bow and Arrow,
you're going to fucking starve to death.

2805
02:12:17,421 --> 02:12:19,910
Right?
It's an extremely difficult,

2806
02:12:19,911 --> 02:12:21,620
yes.
To get clothes,

2807
02:12:21,720 --> 02:12:22,553
you know,
and yet hunter gatherers for thousands 

2808
02:12:24,920 --> 02:12:26,120
and thousands of years have succeeded in
doing that.

2809
02:12:26,121 --> 02:12:26,641
Like the,
the,

2810
02:12:26,641 --> 02:12:28,210
the,
the bushmen of the Kalahari,

2811
02:12:28,800 --> 02:12:31,690
less humans and more animals.
Right.

2812
02:12:31,730 --> 02:12:33,830
I think that's also part of the rub.
Okay.

2813
02:12:33,940 --> 02:12:37,840
It's like we're dealing with just one of
the terrible things we've done is taking

2814
02:12:38,230 --> 02:12:42,100
these giant swaths of land and made them
entirely inhabitable for wildlife.

2815
02:12:42,460 --> 02:12:44,060
Like cities like you,
you,

2816
02:12:44,080 --> 02:12:46,150
when you w how many people grow food in 
the city,

2817
02:12:46,151 --> 02:12:46,984
then what is the percentage that even 
one 10th of 1% of people in the city 

2818
02:12:49,361 --> 02:12:50,810
grow their own food?
Probably not.

2819
02:12:50,820 --> 02:12:51,653
Probably not even that.
So you have these massive essentially 

2820
02:12:53,861 --> 02:12:54,694
deserts with,
we're no wildlife exist other than 

2821
02:12:57,160 --> 02:13:00,700
predatory species like coyotes and 
ravens and things like that that take,

2822
02:13:01,060 --> 02:13:02,260
and then you,
you,

2823
02:13:02,320 --> 02:13:05,470
you go out from there and then you have 
these vast farmlands.

2824
02:13:05,860 --> 02:13:09,700
The only benefit of the vast farm lands 
is the amount of deer that exists now as

2825
02:13:09,701 --> 02:13:10,534
greatly more than when Columbus landed.
But it's because they've almost become 

2826
02:13:14,591 --> 02:13:16,120
an agricultural animal.

2827
02:13:16,130 --> 02:13:18,550
It's almost like they're almost a 
domesticated animal.

2828
02:13:18,551 --> 02:13:21,280
There are free,
wild domesticated animal.

2829
02:13:21,460 --> 02:13:24,490
Like I have a friend who has a farm in 
Iowa and when you go there,

2830
02:13:24,491 --> 02:13:25,324
it's very strange because he's got these
wild giant 300 pound forest horses 

2831
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:33,240
running around his backyard.
I mean they're,

2832
02:13:33,241 --> 02:13:36,240
they're fucking everywhere.
There's all these giant deer and when we

2833
02:13:36,241 --> 02:13:37,680
were there,
it's what's called the Rut.

2834
02:13:37,681 --> 02:13:38,430
So all these,
the,

2835
02:13:38,430 --> 02:13:41,550
they're very horny.
So the big bucks who usually hide,

2836
02:13:41,551 --> 02:13:42,690
they show themselves.
I'm like,

2837
02:13:43,140 --> 02:13:46,890
this is a crazy place.
Like there's all these wild animals that

2838
02:13:47,010 --> 02:13:51,030
exist along with people and even in an a
game rich place like that,

2839
02:13:51,180 --> 02:13:54,570
it's incredibly difficult to get to one.
And you'd have to have vegetables,

2840
02:13:54,750 --> 02:13:55,583
you'd have to have your own vegetables.
So let's imagine a situation where all 

2841
02:13:58,261 --> 02:13:59,940
the resources of our cities,
all the,

2842
02:14:00,380 --> 02:14:02,940
all the amenities,
all the infrastructure are gone.

2843
02:14:02,970 --> 02:14:05,760
Most of us are fucked.
I would say radically.

2844
02:14:06,290 --> 02:14:07,170
I would say.
In fact,

2845
02:14:07,171 --> 02:14:08,004
our civilization,
which appears so strong is actually 

2846
02:14:09,811 --> 02:14:11,310
very,
very fragile.

2847
02:14:11,340 --> 02:14:13,110
Extremely.
It just a little push.

2848
02:14:13,140 --> 02:14:15,660
It's like when you look out the window 
and you're like,

2849
02:14:15,661 --> 02:14:16,800
wow,
that's the outside.

2850
02:14:16,801 --> 02:14:18,390
No,
that's a piece of glass.

2851
02:14:18,420 --> 02:14:21,840
You're outside knocked that piece of 
glass in your outside,

2852
02:14:21,841 --> 02:14:23,490
you know,
the effortless it is.

2853
02:14:23,700 --> 02:14:26,160
It just seems impenetrable because you 
know,

2854
02:14:26,161 --> 02:14:29,520
you pulled the shades tied and you set 
your alarm clock and sleep.

2855
02:14:29,640 --> 02:14:31,570
You're sleeping next to the glass.
Yes.

2856
02:14:31,880 --> 02:14:32,713
Like hilarious.
You feel confident and yet you're 

2857
02:14:34,710 --> 02:14:36,490
sleeping next to a piece of fucking 
glass.

2858
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:42,000
Credible complacency and arrogance of 
modern civilization that we are the apex

2859
02:14:42,091 --> 02:14:42,924
and pinnacle of the Human Story.
That we're the best that's ever come 

2860
02:14:45,091 --> 02:14:45,770
and,
and,

2861
02:14:45,770 --> 02:14:46,603
and that's a danger.
Mythologically that is a very dangerous 

2862
02:14:49,891 --> 02:14:54,600
place to be when you start imagining 
yourself as the apex and the pinnacle of

2863
02:14:54,601 --> 02:14:54,930
everything.

2864
02:14:54,930 --> 02:14:55,763
That's precisely when the universe 
reminds you that you are not that at 

2865
02:14:58,261 --> 02:14:59,340
all.
Yeah.

2866
02:14:59,341 --> 02:15:04,341
It's a very weird existence that we have
where we just sort of look at how things

2867
02:15:04,621 --> 02:15:05,454
are right now and we can't imagine 
things being any different no matter 

2868
02:15:09,271 --> 02:15:11,760
what,
whether it's people that have to come to

2869
02:15:12,480 --> 02:15:14,310
the realization that they had been 
injured,

2870
02:15:14,370 --> 02:15:16,830
like someone breaks their leg and all of
a sudden it just doesn't compute.

2871
02:15:16,831 --> 02:15:18,390
Like,
how come I can't walk anymore?

2872
02:15:18,690 --> 02:15:19,523
Well,
your reality is now shifted and this 

2873
02:15:21,031 --> 02:15:21,864
reality that we have here with this 
fairly healthy earth could shift at any 

2874
02:15:25,651 --> 02:15:26,484
moment that the yellowstone volcano is 
the one that's been freaking me out the 

2875
02:15:29,671 --> 02:15:31,990
most over the last few years.
Another big

2876
02:15:32,380 --> 02:15:33,213
issue.
Yeah.

2877
02:15:34,090 --> 02:15:37,550
An interesting parallel would be if we 
look at smaller,

2878
02:15:37,570 --> 02:15:40,750
what happens in smaller catastrophes 
like we've seen today,

2879
02:15:41,020 --> 02:15:42,210
when we look at the,
um,

2880
02:15:42,970 --> 02:15:43,990
at,
for example,

2881
02:15:43,991 --> 02:15:46,780
when Katrina hit and hit New Orleans,
right?

2882
02:15:47,410 --> 02:15:51,460
It was almost as if the human species 
separated into two subspecies.

2883
02:15:51,940 --> 02:15:56,940
You had one group of people that rose to
the occasion and did heroic things.

2884
02:15:57,401 --> 02:16:00,460
They organized and they saved people 
spontaneously.

2885
02:16:00,461 --> 02:16:03,010
You know,
because the government was conspicuously

2886
02:16:03,011 --> 02:16:03,844
absent for five days,
the first five days of the Katrina 

2887
02:16:06,461 --> 02:16:09,580
disaster.
And here you had a major flooding of,

2888
02:16:09,581 --> 02:16:10,870
of New Orleans,
and,

2889
02:16:11,260 --> 02:16:12,093
and you had people spontaneously 
organizing and performing these heroic 

2890
02:16:15,880 --> 02:16:18,420
actions of,
of saving their fellow man and,

2891
02:16:18,710 --> 02:16:22,450
and doing just stupendous things,
superhero type things.

2892
02:16:22,720 --> 02:16:25,360
But then you had another segment of the 
population.

2893
02:16:25,361 --> 02:16:29,560
It just went completely barbaric and you
had mass rapes and you know,

2894
02:16:29,561 --> 02:16:30,250
smashing

2895
02:16:30,250 --> 02:16:33,400
of,
of businesses and looting and in,

2896
02:16:33,460 --> 02:16:36,580
and just people running in wild,
complete,

2897
02:16:36,880 --> 02:16:41,880
unrestrained gangs just in just 
committing violent acts at random.

2898
02:16:42,550 --> 02:16:43,383
So,

2899
02:16:43,720 --> 02:16:44,553
and America,
the richest country on earth did not 

2900
02:16:46,031 --> 02:16:47,260
manage that crisis.
Well,

2901
02:16:47,290 --> 02:16:48,123
no,
I mean it was very,

2902
02:16:48,520 --> 02:16:51,310
and that was a little crisis by 
comparison with what we talked.

2903
02:16:51,370 --> 02:16:53,140
Can you remember when Kanye West go on 
TV?

2904
02:16:53,141 --> 02:16:56,500
George Bush does not like black people.
I don't remember that.

2905
02:16:56,501 --> 02:16:57,970
But yeah.
George Bush,

2906
02:16:57,971 --> 02:16:58,804
I think it was on day four.
George Bush flew over in Air Force One 

2907
02:17:01,721 --> 02:17:03,700
and look out the window.
It's wave.

2908
02:17:03,701 --> 02:17:04,550
Yeah.
Yeah.

2909
02:17:04,900 --> 02:17:06,040
Give people hope.
But there's,

2910
02:17:06,070 --> 02:17:08,920
there's a lesson lessons in those kinds 
of events.

2911
02:17:08,970 --> 02:17:09,521
Sure.
Yeah,

2912
02:17:09,521 --> 02:17:12,370
we're not prepared.
And we have to extrapolate from that.

2913
02:17:12,690 --> 02:17:13,390
And,
and you know,

2914
02:17:13,390 --> 02:17:14,720
if you,
if you go back and we will,

2915
02:17:14,790 --> 02:17:16,840
you know,
I oftentime is a thought exercise.

2916
02:17:16,841 --> 02:17:17,674
Think how,
how would we respond if we knew that 

2917
02:17:20,411 --> 02:17:21,244
there was a high probability of a 
younger dryas type event or series of 

2918
02:17:25,181 --> 02:17:28,660
events impending in our future?
What would you do to start drinking or,

2919
02:17:29,560 --> 02:17:33,270
well it all depends on lead time.
It all depends on lead time.

2920
02:17:33,280 --> 02:17:34,113
If it's a 10 day lead time,
my [inaudible] not going to be able to 

2921
02:17:35,381 --> 02:17:40,330
shoot a rocket up there and man fire up 
that Dubar again unless I go hard.

2922
02:17:40,360 --> 02:17:41,650
Go hard to the end.
Yeah,

2923
02:17:42,130 --> 02:17:45,910
10 days but 10 years or 20 minutes,
then we can do some stuff.

2924
02:17:45,950 --> 02:17:46,783
Then we can do some stuff.
The real scary thing is there's two 

2925
02:17:48,731 --> 02:17:49,990
scary things.
One,

2926
02:17:50,520 --> 02:17:52,630
uh,
if you survived cause he's like,

2927
02:17:52,631 --> 02:17:53,860
fuck.
You know,

2928
02:17:53,861 --> 02:17:54,694
if you,
if you really did survive and everybody 

2929
02:17:55,811 --> 02:17:56,644
else was jacked and all of sudden you're
dealing with some mad max type reality 

2930
02:17:59,410 --> 02:18:00,243
where people are starving to death and 
they're very desperate and they become 

2931
02:18:02,411 --> 02:18:03,244
almost like animals.
That's entirely inside the realm of 

2932
02:18:06,191 --> 02:18:08,410
possibility.
Well that's what we learned from Katrina

2933
02:18:08,440 --> 02:18:09,273
or the other terrifying possibility is 
that you leave the future of 

2934
02:18:13,001 --> 02:18:13,834
civilization up to those other people 
cause it tastes survive and they have 

2935
02:18:18,731 --> 02:18:20,800
kids and their kids survive.
And somehow or another,

2936
02:18:20,801 --> 02:18:21,634
somewhere along the line we get better 
and better at understanding our place 

2937
02:18:24,041 --> 02:18:24,874
here,
which is what I think has happened and 

2938
02:18:26,411 --> 02:18:27,244
all it would take is one,
I mean this is as much as people are 

2939
02:18:29,771 --> 02:18:30,604
complaining right now,
as much as there's riots in the streets 

2940
02:18:32,621 --> 02:18:33,850
because of,
or excuse me,

2941
02:18:33,880 --> 02:18:35,020
uh,
protests in the street,

2942
02:18:35,400 --> 02:18:36,233
some rights apparently,
but over the president elect with this 

2943
02:18:39,731 --> 02:18:43,510
time is it represents the greatest time 
in history when it comes to safety,

2944
02:18:43,720 --> 02:18:46,030
when it comes to knowledge,
access to information,

2945
02:18:46,031 --> 02:18:47,200
the way we understand each other.

2946
02:18:47,200 --> 02:18:49,300
I don't think it's ever been better as 
far as,

2947
02:18:49,301 --> 02:18:50,410
as long as we know

2948
02:18:50,640 --> 02:18:53,030
we have everything at our feet.
Yeah,

2949
02:18:53,040 --> 02:18:53,873
there's the,
there's incredible potential in modern 

2950
02:18:56,911 --> 02:18:57,990
civilization.
The,

2951
02:18:58,320 --> 02:19:02,340
but the problem is that there's also 
very rigid mind control.

2952
02:19:02,430 --> 02:19:05,940
The way that our society's work,
it's turning people into drones.

2953
02:19:06,300 --> 02:19:07,133
People,
people brought up to believe that their 

2954
02:19:08,251 --> 02:19:11,310
only purpose in existence is production 
and consumption.

2955
02:19:11,550 --> 02:19:15,900
That the people forced to fit into a 
sort of narrow place in the machine,

2956
02:19:15,901 --> 02:19:17,940
mass media beaming,
you know,

2957
02:19:17,941 --> 02:19:18,774
messages at us at us all the time.
Even the concept of democracy is absurd 

2958
02:19:22,411 --> 02:19:23,244
when you don't,
when you don't have complete 

2959
02:19:24,181 --> 02:19:25,740
transparency,
when there are secrets,

2960
02:19:25,741 --> 02:19:27,560
when things are hidden,
how can the people vote?

2961
02:19:27,950 --> 02:19:29,000
You know,
with the clear,

2962
02:19:29,001 --> 02:19:31,820
with clear minded out a lot is being 
hidden from them.

2963
02:19:31,821 --> 02:19:35,360
That's not democracy.
Democracy is in fact invest in,

2964
02:19:35,450 --> 02:19:38,150
in mind control.
Most unfortunate development.

2965
02:19:38,640 --> 02:19:39,473
Well I,
I wonder how long it's going to take 

2966
02:19:41,971 --> 02:19:42,804
before the rigid mindsets that are in 
place right now and this idea of this 

2967
02:19:47,401 --> 02:19:51,120
resistance to change that we were 
talking about when it comes to science,

2968
02:19:51,121 --> 02:19:54,150
when it comes to accepting this,
uh,

2969
02:19:54,880 --> 02:19:57,870
asteroidal impact theory.
And I think that exists in politics.

2970
02:19:57,871 --> 02:20:00,570
I think it exists in religion.
I think it exists socially,

2971
02:20:00,571 --> 02:20:01,404
the way we approach relationships and 
friendships and just all of it is 

2972
02:20:04,981 --> 02:20:08,310
evolving in front of our eyes.
I was watching a movie last night.

2973
02:20:08,640 --> 02:20:11,730
I'm not another teenage movies said what
it is.

2974
02:20:11,760 --> 02:20:13,530
Is that what it's called?
And I was live tweeting it.

2975
02:20:13,680 --> 02:20:14,513
So smoking pot and writing and sometimes
I just like to have the TV on and not 

2976
02:20:17,701 --> 02:20:18,534
listen to it.
Just just sometimes I like to see some 

2977
02:20:20,611 --> 02:20:22,470
things when I'm just writing things 
sometimes.

2978
02:20:22,471 --> 02:20:23,304
I know that last night I chose to do it 
that way and I just got so enamored in 

2979
02:20:26,881 --> 02:20:31,881
this weird movie from 2001 this is the 
movie felt like a time machine.

2980
02:20:32,610 --> 02:20:37,610
It was like I was watching this culture 
that does not exist anymore.

2981
02:20:38,130 --> 02:20:38,963
It's one of those like a teenager movies
where like in college and they're 

2982
02:20:43,621 --> 02:20:44,454
drinking,
there's a lot of naked women and really 

2983
02:20:46,471 --> 02:20:47,304
racist,
sexist humor and it's really crude and 

2984
02:20:50,071 --> 02:20:52,110
goofy and stupid.
And I'm like,

2985
02:20:52,140 --> 02:20:55,020
this is so bizarre because they,
this doesn't exist anymore.

2986
02:20:55,021 --> 02:20:57,290
And this kind of film like this is like 
a,

2987
02:20:57,300 --> 02:20:59,850
this is like Al Jolson with black face 
on or something.

2988
02:21:00,120 --> 02:21:02,730
And in a way it's like a cultural time 
machine.

2989
02:21:02,880 --> 02:21:03,713
Like you get to go and for a brief 
moment see like this comedy that 

2990
02:21:07,231 --> 02:21:10,560
somebody can cocked it in 2001 which 
seems so recent,

2991
02:21:11,010 --> 02:21:11,843
but it's such a,
in that film you get evidence of this 

2992
02:21:15,421 --> 02:21:17,460
weird cultural change.
I shouldn't say weird,

2993
02:21:17,790 --> 02:21:18,623
massive cultural change that's happened 
as far as the where we're allowed to 

2994
02:21:21,751 --> 02:21:22,584
joke around about things and if there's 
some racist shit in that movie like 

2995
02:21:25,471 --> 02:21:26,304
racist and sexist Shit and violence like
men punching women in the face and shit 

2996
02:21:29,881 --> 02:21:30,714
like that.
He just can't really do in a comedy 

2997
02:21:31,990 --> 02:21:35,040
today and that's only 15 years ago and 
what,

2998
02:21:35,041 --> 02:21:35,874
what is it going to be like if we can 
avoid getting hit by a rock blowing 

2999
02:21:39,361 --> 02:21:40,660
ourselves up.
Yellowstone,

3000
02:21:40,680 --> 02:21:43,080
blow it up in our face if we can keep 
going.

3001
02:21:43,290 --> 02:21:44,123
I think we're on a great path.
I think our lists of where people think 

3002
02:21:46,111 --> 02:21:47,460
about the president elect,
and

3003
02:21:47,840 --> 02:21:51,230
I think we're on a great path.
It's a hazardous passed it path.

3004
02:21:51,231 --> 02:21:52,064
It's a,
it's a path where the future is not a 

3005
02:21:53,541 --> 02:21:58,541
tall certain but but humanity is at one 
of those moments,

3006
02:21:58,940 --> 02:22:02,660
one of those crossroads where you kind 
of stand on the edge of an abyss and and

3007
02:22:02,661 --> 02:22:03,494
you don't quite know what lies ahead and
we can take a really great path out of 

3008
02:22:07,341 --> 02:22:09,570
this or we can take a really horrible 
path.

3009
02:22:10,530 --> 02:22:11,363
And the,
I think the key issue is that we do 

3010
02:22:13,311 --> 02:22:15,290
actually have choice.
It doesn't have to be that way.

3011
02:22:15,291 --> 02:22:16,124
I see a lot of positive,
a lot that's positive out there out 

3012
02:22:19,011 --> 02:22:21,440
there in the world.
I do think people are waking up.

3013
02:22:21,470 --> 02:22:23,300
I think they are questioning old 
structures.

3014
02:22:23,301 --> 02:22:26,430
They're refusing to put up with the 
bullshit any longer.

3015
02:22:26,640 --> 02:22:27,473
More and more people are doing that as 
happening in the realm of politics is 

3016
02:22:29,461 --> 02:22:31,680
happening in the realm of dealing with 
the big corporations.

3017
02:22:31,680 --> 02:22:34,290
It's happening in the realm of 
investigating the past.

3018
02:22:34,590 --> 02:22:37,260
We're just not going to be told what to 
think anymore.

3019
02:22:37,500 --> 02:22:39,480
That's encouraging.
But then on the other side,

3020
02:22:39,720 --> 02:22:40,553
there are huge efforts being put 
precisely into making people think in 

3021
02:22:43,111 --> 02:22:45,300
certain ways,
whether it's the advertising industry,

3022
02:22:45,301 --> 02:22:48,540
whether it's political messages.
And so we have to be aware of that.

3023
02:22:48,541 --> 02:22:51,300
And it could go,
it could go down the drone path.

3024
02:22:51,301 --> 02:22:53,490
I mean like the b,
the beehive path,

3025
02:22:53,491 --> 02:22:54,324
which would be it.
Why even bother to be human if your 

3026
02:22:56,430 --> 02:22:57,263
society is turning you into a worker 
drone in a a beehive life existence or 

3027
02:23:01,411 --> 02:23:04,400
it could go down and expansion of 
consciousness and,

3028
02:23:04,401 --> 02:23:06,600
and,
and the realization of the incredible,

3029
02:23:06,930 --> 02:23:10,830
beautiful potential of the human race.
That's where it's going.

3030
02:23:11,790 --> 02:23:13,530
I'm optimistic,
I'm very optimistic.

3031
02:23:13,820 --> 02:23:14,653
Beautiful to hear because this is a time
like I was watching the John Oliver 

3032
02:23:17,571 --> 02:23:19,420
show.
It's a great show on Hbo,

3033
02:23:19,430 --> 02:23:22,490
Very Funny Guy and is very left wing,
uh,

3034
02:23:22,700 --> 02:23:23,533
leaning as as his show.
But they had this fuck 2016 thing where 

3035
02:23:26,961 --> 02:23:27,794
they were just naming off all the 
horrible things that happened in 2016 

3036
02:23:31,010 --> 02:23:33,120
and then just saying goodbye to this 
terrible year.

3037
02:23:33,121 --> 02:23:34,050
And I'm like,
yeah,

3038
02:23:34,340 --> 02:23:36,650
I have a lot of good shit happened this 
year too.

3039
02:23:36,680 --> 02:23:40,640
There's a lot of fantastic discoveries,
a lot of interesting observations.

3040
02:23:40,641 --> 02:23:45,380
A lot of people learned a lot of things 
in 2016 as well and I think that

3041
02:23:45,740 --> 02:23:48,470
quite a number of American states have 
made cannabis legal.

3042
02:23:48,560 --> 02:23:49,341
Yes,
that's,

3043
02:23:49,341 --> 02:23:50,780
I think there's a huge develop,

3044
02:23:50,830 --> 02:23:52,560
it's,
it's also a big,

3045
02:23:52,680 --> 02:23:55,470
it's going to be a big factor in our 
cultural evolution.

3046
02:23:55,530 --> 02:23:56,363
It really well,
well it was a big factor in the 60s it 

3047
02:23:58,801 --> 02:24:01,800
was a huge factor in in effect what 
happened.

3048
02:24:01,801 --> 02:24:02,634
You had a very closed conservative 
society and then you had an outside 

3049
02:24:06,271 --> 02:24:09,140
shock in the form of the psychedelic 
drugs.

3050
02:24:09,150 --> 02:24:09,983
They came in and completely stirred up 
everything in art and music and fashion 

3051
02:24:14,071 --> 02:24:14,904
and even into scientific concepts of,
of our place in the universe and time 

3052
02:24:19,231 --> 02:24:20,064
and space and in so many ways that had 
just a major impact on the direction 

3053
02:24:25,531 --> 02:24:26,364
that our society when and what would be 
the equivalent today or in our near 

3054
02:24:30,871 --> 02:24:31,704
future in terms of an outside shock that
would suddenly wake people up would be 

3055
02:24:37,831 --> 02:24:38,664
another event.
Another 10 goose government and based 

3056
02:24:41,821 --> 02:24:42,654
upon everything that I've seen,
it would suggest that events like that 

3057
02:24:46,771 --> 02:24:50,670
are going to happen and probably within 
our lifetime and when it does happen,

3058
02:24:51,390 --> 02:24:52,223
especially if the message of the story 
has been out and enough people have 

3059
02:24:55,801 --> 02:24:56,634
heard it,
5% of the people are 10% of the people 

3060
02:24:58,860 --> 02:24:59,693
are aware that there is this major 
impending potential paradigm shift and 

3061
02:25:04,861 --> 02:25:06,390
then we have an event like that.

3062
02:25:06,810 --> 02:25:11,450
An event like Tunguska 1908 I think 
that's all it would take because the,

3063
02:25:11,451 --> 02:25:16,451
the magnitude of that event would have 
been such that it occurred today and you

3064
02:25:16,591 --> 02:25:17,424
had anywhere from a million to 2 million
people instantly wiped out or a whole 

3065
02:25:21,901 --> 02:25:24,490
city instantly annihilated

3066
02:25:25,060 --> 02:25:26,530
from a thing,
from a shot,

3067
02:25:26,531 --> 02:25:29,200
from space.
What effect would that have on,

3068
02:25:29,230 --> 02:25:31,000
on the planetary consciousness

3069
02:25:31,220 --> 02:25:32,053
and which with this latest exercise,
NASA coming late to the party finally 

3070
02:25:35,031 --> 02:25:37,520
seems to be thinking about that.
What happened there?

3071
02:25:38,120 --> 02:25:39,930
What happened if la is hit by,
you know,

3072
02:25:39,931 --> 02:25:41,480
a 350 foot diameter,

3073
02:25:41,540 --> 02:25:43,850
right.
And after the comment is because we'll,

3074
02:25:43,910 --> 02:25:44,581
when the,
when the,

3075
02:25:44,581 --> 02:25:48,820
the probability models for a tin Guscott
type event were first laid out in,

3076
02:25:49,040 --> 02:25:51,260
in the fifties and sixties and into the 
70s,

3077
02:25:51,261 --> 02:25:52,094
it was pretty much determined that it 
was like something that would happen 

3078
02:25:54,351 --> 02:25:57,110
once a millennium,
once every couple of millenniums,

3079
02:25:57,320 --> 02:26:00,080
then it sort of got contracted to once 
every few centuries.

3080
02:26:00,350 --> 02:26:01,183
You know,
it may be that it's actually much more 

3081
02:26:02,961 --> 02:26:03,794
like one or two a century or maybe even 
perhaps clustered events where you may 

3082
02:26:08,421 --> 02:26:09,254
have three or four or half a dozen of 
those type events occurring over very 

3083
02:26:13,341 --> 02:26:16,880
short window of time.
But an event like that happening,

3084
02:26:16,881 --> 02:26:20,990
not one that would be caused the 
extinction of civilization by any means,

3085
02:26:21,290 --> 02:26:26,290
but an event like that that could wipe 
out a thousand square miles of landscape

3086
02:26:26,841 --> 02:26:28,180
completely,
um,

3087
02:26:28,580 --> 02:26:33,580
in an instant would have a major effect.
I think on the people of this planet.

3088
02:26:34,010 --> 02:26:34,843
It would focus minds.
It would focus minds in a way that 

3089
02:26:36,861 --> 02:26:38,320
nothing else would.
And I,

3090
02:26:38,380 --> 02:26:39,213
I,
it's not to me is it pessimistic to say 

3091
02:26:41,601 --> 02:26:44,870
that might be what it's going to take or
is it just realistic?

3092
02:26:45,230 --> 02:26:46,250
I don't know.
Well,

3093
02:26:46,310 --> 02:26:47,143
I think it's like the,
the massive impact versus the slow 

3094
02:26:49,791 --> 02:26:50,840
trickle effect.
I mean,

3095
02:26:50,841 --> 02:26:54,740
is it going to happen eventually or is 
it going to happen in one gigantic swoop

3096
02:26:54,741 --> 02:26:55,574
because of an event like a asteroidal 
impact where it kills a bunch of people 

3097
02:26:58,341 --> 02:27:01,010
and we wake up to the fragility of our 
existence.

3098
02:27:01,080 --> 02:27:02,760
But either way,
it's a waking up of,

3099
02:27:02,790 --> 02:27:03,623
of,
of humanity and that is in process that 

3100
02:27:05,131 --> 02:27:06,660
is happening.
That is in process.

3101
02:27:06,661 --> 02:27:07,494
Now look as a,
as a Brit observing what's been 

3102
02:27:09,961 --> 02:27:10,794
happening in America as an outsider,
I'm enormously encouraged by the 

3103
02:27:13,590 --> 02:27:15,900
legalization of cannabis movement that 
is,

3104
02:27:15,901 --> 02:27:17,640
that is taking place here and,
and,

3105
02:27:17,670 --> 02:27:20,130
and what it and what it all means.
Sure.

3106
02:27:20,131 --> 02:27:22,530
I liked to smoke a joint,
but this is not about getting high.

3107
02:27:22,531 --> 02:27:23,364
It's not about recreation.
What this is about is recognizing the 

3108
02:27:25,651 --> 02:27:29,520
sovereignty of adults to make decisions 
over their own bodies,

3109
02:27:29,730 --> 02:27:30,563
their own health and their own 
consciousness while doing no harm to 

3110
02:27:32,971 --> 02:27:34,170
others.
That's what it's about.

3111
02:27:34,171 --> 02:27:36,660
And that's a really fucking important 
issue.

3112
02:27:36,661 --> 02:27:37,560
That is,
for me,

3113
02:27:37,561 --> 02:27:38,394
that is the most important issue because
if we live in a society that is not 

3114
02:27:40,921 --> 02:27:44,460
prepared to recognize adults sovereignty
over one's own body,

3115
02:27:44,461 --> 02:27:45,294
in one's own consciousness,
then that cannot be a free society in 

3116
02:27:48,031 --> 02:27:48,960
any meaningful way.

3117
02:27:48,960 --> 02:27:49,793
And so I applaud the people of America 
in those states who have voted for full 

3118
02:27:53,251 --> 02:27:55,740
legalization.
That's a brilliant thing to do,

3119
02:27:55,741 --> 02:27:56,574
and that's going to have an impact 
around the world because the war on 

3120
02:27:58,441 --> 02:28:01,560
drugs,
all the ideology and lies about cannabis

3121
02:28:01,770 --> 02:28:02,603
are all going to be proved wrong.
We're going to know that the emperor 

3122
02:28:05,431 --> 02:28:06,264
wears no clothes,
that you can legalize cannabis and 

3123
02:28:08,071 --> 02:28:08,904
civilization does not fall apart as the 
war on drugs lobby had been telling us 

3124
02:28:12,091 --> 02:28:13,800
for ages.
It's going to,

3125
02:28:13,950 --> 02:28:14,783
it's going to change everything.
And it's a beautiful thing because it's 

3126
02:28:16,531 --> 02:28:17,364
the American people.
Whereas the American state America as a 

3127
02:28:20,900 --> 02:28:22,160
governmental state

3128
02:28:22,160 --> 02:28:26,420
presence on the world stage has been the
dark force behind the war on drugs.

3129
02:28:26,660 --> 02:28:28,130
So it's,
it's,

3130
02:28:28,131 --> 02:28:28,964
uh,
to me a beautiful thing that is the 

3131
02:28:29,931 --> 02:28:33,170
American people's state by state who are
winding that back and saying,

3132
02:28:33,380 --> 02:28:35,420
we will not put up with this shit 
anymore.

3133
02:28:35,780 --> 02:28:38,030
I think when you were talking about 
earlier is really important too.

3134
02:28:38,031 --> 02:28:43,031
We were talking about different factions
of our civilization or creating it.

3135
02:28:43,461 --> 02:28:44,294
To this day,
they're still creating disinformation 

3136
02:28:45,771 --> 02:28:46,604
and still trying to mislead people.
But I think that goes to what we're 

3137
02:28:50,870 --> 02:28:51,703
talking about before where it's a system
and systems protect themselves and I 

3138
02:28:55,311 --> 02:28:57,950
think that they develop almost a 
consciousness of their own.

3139
02:28:57,951 --> 02:28:59,310
It's scary in a way.
Yeah.

3140
02:28:59,340 --> 02:29:00,750
Yeah.
Big bureaucracies arm,

3141
02:29:00,751 --> 02:29:02,750
the bureaucracies,
they got to kind of personality.

3142
02:29:02,800 --> 02:29:03,633
Well,
even when there's no financial stake in 

3143
02:29:04,611 --> 02:29:06,410
it,
there's just a social stake.

3144
02:29:06,590 --> 02:29:09,110
Like what you're seeing right now with 
the left versus the right.

3145
02:29:09,320 --> 02:29:10,153
Like there's some people,
like my friend Wanda Sykes just got 

3146
02:29:13,071 --> 02:29:13,904
booed off stage at some thing last night
apparently when she went on some anti 

3147
02:29:17,001 --> 02:29:20,300
trump rant and then,
and people got super upset at her.

3148
02:29:20,540 --> 02:29:22,820
There's these systems that are in place.
It's there.

3149
02:29:22,821 --> 02:29:23,750
There's this,
uh,

3150
02:29:23,990 --> 02:29:28,730
Wa almost like wanting to fight.
Like it's not,

3151
02:29:29,380 --> 02:29:30,213
it,
it sets us up in this bizarre team 

3152
02:29:31,911 --> 02:29:35,900
mentality with his left,
protects its ideas of the future and the

3153
02:29:35,901 --> 02:29:36,734
right protects its ideas.
And I'm watching these people go at it 

3154
02:29:39,231 --> 02:29:41,870
back and forth on social media and it's 
toxic.

3155
02:29:42,020 --> 02:29:45,140
And I don't like to use that term 
because it's so compromised by,

3156
02:29:45,400 --> 02:29:46,233
you know,
toxic sexuality or toxic masculinity is 

3157
02:29:48,821 --> 02:29:51,050
so many uses of that word in our 
culture.

3158
02:29:51,051 --> 02:29:51,884
But I think that this desire to fight 
with each other and be deeply 

3159
02:29:54,531 --> 02:29:56,360
unpleasant,
really horrible,

3160
02:29:56,361 --> 02:29:57,770
hurtful,
ghastly things.

3161
02:29:57,771 --> 02:30:01,820
They just see it so often and it really,
I mean vile and from the left to as well

3162
02:30:01,821 --> 02:30:04,070
as the right,
the left is the right word.

3163
02:30:04,130 --> 02:30:04,963
Exactly.
And I think that we have to resist the 

3164
02:30:07,971 --> 02:30:12,290
urge to fight.
I think this is when people push too far

3165
02:30:12,291 --> 02:30:14,450
on the left.
That's when the alt right emerges.

3166
02:30:14,690 --> 02:30:15,523
When people push too far on the right,
that's when the left comes up and you 

3167
02:30:18,201 --> 02:30:19,034
know,
and that's when you know Kent state 

3168
02:30:19,700 --> 02:30:22,790
emergency,
you have all these weird factions duking

3169
02:30:22,791 --> 02:30:23,624
it out that have so much in common and a
lot of times the things that they don't 

3170
02:30:26,931 --> 02:30:27,764
have in common,
it's either because of an ignorance or 

3171
02:30:29,931 --> 02:30:33,080
it's because of an ideological dispute 
or a lack of communication.

3172
02:30:33,081 --> 02:30:34,940
And I think if those three things are in
place,

3173
02:30:35,240 --> 02:30:36,073
at least open lines of communication,
which is also fostered by marijuana and 

3174
02:30:40,370 --> 02:30:41,203
it gets these people talking openly and 
vulnerably about these things and you 

3175
02:30:45,051 --> 02:30:45,884
find out that a lot of our misgivings 
and our misunderstandings about each 

3176
02:30:48,981 --> 02:30:53,180
other or just misconceptions,
miscommunications and we will even if we

3177
02:30:53,181 --> 02:30:56,540
disagree on things.
I have friends that disagree on a lot of

3178
02:30:56,541 --> 02:30:58,400
stuff with,
but we're very close.

3179
02:30:58,420 --> 02:30:59,260
Yeah,
because we're all,

3180
02:30:59,330 --> 02:31:00,890
you're allowed to have different 
opinions.

3181
02:31:00,891 --> 02:31:02,470
Of course.
That's what makes the world interest.

3182
02:31:02,471 --> 02:31:05,050
It doesn't have to be we hand at each 
other because one weekend is land.

3183
02:31:05,060 --> 02:31:05,893
Listen to somebody else's opinion with 
empathy rather than with hatred or 

3184
02:31:08,900 --> 02:31:09,733
anger.
We have.

3185
02:31:09,740 --> 02:31:13,250
We're too,
it's too attractive to be on a team like

3186
02:31:13,251 --> 02:31:14,150
the fucking mason.

3187
02:31:17,090 --> 02:31:17,871
Yeah,
it is,

3188
02:31:17,871 --> 02:31:18,281
man.
It's,

3189
02:31:18,281 --> 02:31:20,370
it's too attractive.
It's too attractive

3190
02:31:20,370 --> 02:31:21,181
and we love,
I mean,

3191
02:31:21,181 --> 02:31:23,370
we love city versus city.
We'd love that.

3192
02:31:23,371 --> 02:31:24,204
We love when you know,
Chicago is going to take on Cleveland 

3193
02:31:26,490 --> 02:31:27,930
folk you,
we'd love that.

3194
02:31:27,931 --> 02:31:29,640
The tribal,
the tribal thing.

3195
02:31:29,641 --> 02:31:29,971
We,
you know,

3196
02:31:29,971 --> 02:31:30,381
we,
we've,

3197
02:31:30,381 --> 02:31:34,170
we've not really evolved out of that.
We've changed our social structures,

3198
02:31:34,171 --> 02:31:35,004
but we're still tribal tribal mentality.
Nationalism is just tribalism writ 

3199
02:31:38,401 --> 02:31:39,630
large.
Solid.

3200
02:31:39,720 --> 02:31:41,970
It really is.
Just like I was religions.

3201
02:31:41,971 --> 02:31:43,650
Just a coat with a lot more people.
Yeah,

3202
02:31:44,340 --> 02:31:45,173
exactly.
Yeah.

3203
02:31:45,180 --> 02:31:46,440
Should we look at one more?
Yeah.

3204
02:31:46,441 --> 02:31:47,760
We could look at as many as you want,
man.

3205
02:31:47,900 --> 02:31:48,840
Oh,
roll the party.

3206
02:31:49,810 --> 02:31:50,643
What do you got?
Yeah.

3207
02:31:50,700 --> 02:31:51,720
Let's see.
The next one.

3208
02:31:51,870 --> 02:31:52,703
Back to the flood.
This is the place that I didn't get to 

3209
02:31:54,241 --> 02:31:54,870
take.
Graham,

3210
02:31:54,870 --> 02:31:57,890
can I really pay more?
I really wanted to take you here.

3211
02:31:57,930 --> 02:31:59,190
Let's see it.
Let's see it.

3212
02:31:59,730 --> 02:32:01,380
So you're going to see it second best.

3213
02:32:01,420 --> 02:32:02,690
Okay.
Possibly did.

3214
02:32:02,691 --> 02:32:06,810
This is the potholes.
Oh Shit.

3215
02:32:06,811 --> 02:32:08,940
Look at that.
This is crazy.

3216
02:32:08,941 --> 02:32:11,220
This will,
we're looking at folks that,

3217
02:32:11,221 --> 02:32:12,054
people who are just listening in,
you have to go to the youtube now cause 

3218
02:32:16,321 --> 02:32:17,154
this is insanity.
This is as close a like an art for a 

3219
02:32:20,851 --> 02:32:23,640
dummy like me to look at something like 
that and then go,

3220
02:32:23,641 --> 02:32:24,810
oh fuck he for,
yeah,

3221
02:32:24,811 --> 02:32:28,430
that's definitely a river.
The river carve that and cable.

3222
02:32:28,650 --> 02:32:29,483
What you're looking at there is a 
gigantic extinct set of cataract like 

3223
02:32:35,010 --> 02:32:39,330
you would find it Niagara Falls,
but to use grams term writ large,

3224
02:32:40,680 --> 02:32:43,380
we're looking at a ridge.
We're looking east.

3225
02:32:43,830 --> 02:32:47,340
The tsunami wave that swept down over 
these four states.

3226
02:32:47,370 --> 02:32:48,203
One branch of it swept off to the west.
This particular branch of it was 400 

3227
02:32:52,141 --> 02:32:52,974
feet deep.
When it hit this ridge and what it did 

3228
02:32:54,961 --> 02:32:56,760
was it spilled over the ridge in.

3229
02:32:56,760 --> 02:32:57,593
Down here in the foreground you see the 
modern day Columbia River from the top 

3230
02:33:01,111 --> 02:33:02,960
of the ridge where you see the,
the,

3231
02:33:02,980 --> 02:33:07,050
the agriculture and the landscape down 
to the river's about a thousand feet.

3232
02:33:07,680 --> 02:33:08,513
So you basically have to picture,
you've got this huge sheet of of water 

3233
02:33:12,810 --> 02:33:15,960
three to 400 feet deep.
It's rushing over in.

3234
02:33:15,961 --> 02:33:16,794
It finds a low little the lowest spot 
within this ridge and that's where it 

3235
02:33:20,521 --> 02:33:23,400
starts focusing its energy and as it 
does,

3236
02:33:23,401 --> 02:33:24,234
it begins to just strip away the rock.
Now what you're looking at here is this 

3237
02:33:27,601 --> 02:33:28,434
cataract complex.
It's about five miles across and the 

3238
02:33:31,510 --> 02:33:32,343
water came in.
You'll see you've got those kind of 

3239
02:33:33,511 --> 02:33:36,720
curved finger lakes at the top and 
there's tunnels.

3240
02:33:37,530 --> 02:33:38,363
Those are potholes.
Hot holds are formed by underwater 

3241
02:33:41,521 --> 02:33:42,354
turbulence and in in a flood.
This swiftly moving with this much 

3242
02:33:45,841 --> 02:33:46,674
turbulence,
you literally have 40 secular Eddie's 

3243
02:33:49,111 --> 02:33:52,080
high intensity,
high amplitude,

3244
02:33:52,170 --> 02:33:54,870
high energy,
underwater tornadoes,

3245
02:33:54,871 --> 02:33:56,520
literally underwater tornadoes.

3246
02:33:56,550 --> 02:33:57,383
Now these underwater tornadoes are 
typically in this case about a half a 

3247
02:34:00,841 --> 02:34:02,000
mile walk.
Oh my God.

3248
02:34:02,190 --> 02:34:04,860
You're spinning at a high rate of speed 
and they're right there.

3249
02:34:04,861 --> 02:34:05,694
They're probably 600 feet deep because 
the water pouring over the ridges at 

3250
02:34:09,301 --> 02:34:12,780
least 200 and you can see what it's done
to the bedrock.

3251
02:34:12,810 --> 02:34:14,850
Anybody listening you gotta you gotta 
look at this.

3252
02:34:14,851 --> 02:34:16,770
You have to look at this and then listen
to the scale.

3253
02:34:16,870 --> 02:34:20,470
This is,
this is a gigantic scar in the landscape

3254
02:34:20,650 --> 02:34:23,290
of which there are hundreds,
uh,

3255
02:34:23,560 --> 02:34:24,860
around this,
this region,

3256
02:34:24,880 --> 02:34:26,050
the exact location.
Randall,

3257
02:34:26,740 --> 02:34:28,450
this is potholes cataract,
right?

3258
02:34:28,690 --> 02:34:30,950
The exact location.
Um,

3259
02:34:31,720 --> 02:34:34,510
plan he wants to get to it,
which we were in Washington state still.

3260
02:34:34,630 --> 02:34:35,890
Yes,
we're in Washington state,

3261
02:34:35,891 --> 02:34:38,230
central Washington.
It can be right on the Columbia River.

3262
02:34:38,540 --> 02:34:40,740
Um,
just below a Naturi.

3263
02:34:41,150 --> 02:34:42,220
Okay,
well we saw that.

3264
02:34:42,320 --> 02:34:44,740
We saw that huge,
that huge erotic,

3265
02:34:45,100 --> 02:34:45,520
yes.

3266
02:34:45,520 --> 02:34:46,353
Giant 18,000
ton Baldet brought there and chained in 

3267
02:34:49,451 --> 02:34:52,300
an ice bag,
an ice bag floating on the flood.

3268
02:34:52,301 --> 02:34:53,134
Carry a nice bag.
The size of an oil tanker carrying an 

3269
02:34:55,301 --> 02:34:59,110
18,000
ton boulder carried on the flood grounds

3270
02:34:59,111 --> 02:35:03,610
700 feet at La Valley side rest there.
As the flood waters recede,

3271
02:35:03,611 --> 02:35:04,444
the ice melts away and the boulder is 
left sitting there of that boulder in a 

3272
02:35:08,981 --> 02:35:11,740
sec.
What did the people back in this part of

3273
02:35:11,741 --> 02:35:13,330
the country?
What do they think about this?

3274
02:35:13,420 --> 02:35:14,470
Well,
you know,

3275
02:35:14,500 --> 02:35:17,520
they're only just catching on to what 
they're sitting on top of cheese.

3276
02:35:17,560 --> 02:35:19,870
This the first time I went out here in 
[inaudible] 98,

3277
02:35:20,200 --> 02:35:20,951
there was the,
the,

3278
02:35:20,951 --> 02:35:24,700
the Ice Age floods institute.
And I went to their only location,

3279
02:35:24,701 --> 02:35:25,534
which was a,
which was in the better business bureau 

3280
02:35:28,031 --> 02:35:29,920
in Moses Lake,
Washington.

3281
02:35:29,921 --> 02:35:30,754
And it was,
they had one room in the back of this 

3282
02:35:32,441 --> 02:35:34,570
better business or no chamber of 
commerce,

3283
02:35:34,571 --> 02:35:35,530
Chamber of Commerce.

3284
02:35:35,920 --> 02:35:39,250
And there was two elderly ladies in 
there who are basically the,

3285
02:35:39,251 --> 02:35:43,630
the overseers of the group.
Now there's about two dozen chapters and

3286
02:35:44,020 --> 02:35:46,870
every year there's several guided field 
trips,

3287
02:35:47,040 --> 02:35:47,873
uh,
led by geologists who are studying this 

3288
02:35:50,591 --> 02:35:51,424
in their off time.
And I've been on a number of these just 

3289
02:35:53,230 --> 02:35:56,950
to participate and get the,
the access to the geologists in order to

3290
02:35:56,951 --> 02:35:58,380
pick their brains.
Um,

3291
02:35:59,110 --> 02:36:01,360
but this is,
this is very close to um,

3292
02:36:01,420 --> 02:36:02,470
Wenatchee,
Washington.

3293
02:36:02,471 --> 02:36:04,930
So if anybody's wanting to find this on 
google earth,

3294
02:36:04,931 --> 02:36:07,750
this is a google earth image.
Now what we're going to open book before

3295
02:36:07,751 --> 02:36:08,584
we leave the Google Earth image,
I was going to explain that you've got 

3296
02:36:10,601 --> 02:36:11,620
those,
you got those.

3297
02:36:11,830 --> 02:36:13,270
See those lakes,
those,

3298
02:36:13,330 --> 02:36:15,140
there's meandering lakes up.
What?

3299
02:36:15,141 --> 02:36:15,974
You got to pictures?
You've got a sheet of water coming and 

3300
02:36:17,831 --> 02:36:22,780
as it's coming over this ridge,
it's beginning to selectively erode into

3301
02:36:22,900 --> 02:36:25,600
fault lines and cracks within the 
bedrock.

3302
02:36:25,600 --> 02:36:26,433
Can you picture that?
The water is going to naturally try to 

3303
02:36:28,211 --> 02:36:29,044
go into those low spots where there's 
cracks and fissures and it'll start 

3304
02:36:33,010 --> 02:36:37,060
going from a sheet into channeling what 
goes from sheet to a channel.

3305
02:36:37,061 --> 02:36:41,650
Then then that spills over the ridge and
in the middle you see this,

3306
02:36:41,651 --> 02:36:44,800
it's called a rock blade.
See that the rock played?

3307
02:36:44,801 --> 02:36:46,870
Is that that that,
yes,

3308
02:36:46,900 --> 02:36:49,360
that's it right there.
Separating the two alcoves.

3309
02:36:49,900 --> 02:36:53,140
If the flood,
he'd continued for another few days,

3310
02:36:53,141 --> 02:36:53,974
that rock blade would have been gone and
you would've had a single alcove up 

3311
02:36:57,311 --> 02:36:59,890
there.
Now in the next as,

3312
02:36:59,891 --> 02:37:01,750
as this proceeds,
what we're going to do with,

3313
02:37:01,751 --> 02:37:02,584
we're going to go down and we're going 
to be right at the head of the rock 

3314
02:37:04,991 --> 02:37:06,460
blade right there.
Yeah,

3315
02:37:06,670 --> 02:37:09,130
right there.
We're standing right there,

3316
02:37:09,131 --> 02:37:13,600
so now you're going to get to see as the
drone is about to take off,

3317
02:37:13,601 --> 02:37:14,680
you're seeing the landscape.

3318
02:37:14,680 --> 02:37:15,513
We're looking to the east in the 
direction of those finger lakes and I 

3319
02:37:19,671 --> 02:37:23,150
guess the soundtrack,
is it not playing in the sound?

3320
02:37:23,530 --> 02:37:25,150
Not,
oh there we go on here.

3321
02:37:25,420 --> 02:37:29,390
A little Toccata and fugue in d minor.
Ooh,

3322
02:37:29,630 --> 02:37:31,580
okay.
And the landscape opens up.

3323
02:37:31,581 --> 02:37:34,940
So you're on that rock blade.
We're on the rock blade right there.

3324
02:37:35,030 --> 02:37:39,170
So now you can begin to see the scale of
this thing that we were just seeing from

3325
02:37:39,171 --> 02:37:42,200
google earth.
Well now the way when you describe it,

3326
02:37:42,410 --> 02:37:44,990
I mean I would have just looked at it 
and go,

3327
02:37:44,991 --> 02:37:46,220
wow,
that's kind of cool looking.

3328
02:37:46,550 --> 02:37:48,350
I would have never have thought,
oh,

3329
02:37:48,351 --> 02:37:51,080
that was obviously created by water 
pouring through.

3330
02:37:51,130 --> 02:37:55,190
That's the problem is because we haven't
had the scale of perception,

3331
02:37:55,191 --> 02:37:59,450
it took Brett's 25 years to put the 
pieces together.

3332
02:37:59,480 --> 02:38:00,313
We'll also,
we haven't been able to take these sort 

3333
02:38:02,151 --> 02:38:06,620
of high resolution photographs,
drones right above it till recently.

3334
02:38:06,650 --> 02:38:07,530
Yeah,
that's,

3335
02:38:07,590 --> 02:38:10,520
it gives us a whole other insight.
I mean it used to be $1,000

3336
02:38:10,521 --> 02:38:11,930
an hour to get up there and the 
helicopter.

3337
02:38:11,931 --> 02:38:13,610
Now you can fly a drone around,
you know,

3338
02:38:13,700 --> 02:38:15,050
with the phone.
Yeah,

3339
02:38:15,130 --> 02:38:16,370
exactly.
Go pro on it.

3340
02:38:16,460 --> 02:38:17,293
Right here in the middle ground,
you see that big hole that's about 200 

3341
02:38:19,491 --> 02:38:21,170
feet in diameter.
That's,

3342
02:38:21,500 --> 02:38:22,333
that's a pot hole that was created by 
this swirling vortex of massively 

3343
02:38:27,051 --> 02:38:29,210
turbulent water.
Oh Shit.

3344
02:38:29,211 --> 02:38:30,860
This is incredible.
In other words,

3345
02:38:30,861 --> 02:38:34,310
the evidence is all over the landscape,
all staring us in the eyes.

3346
02:38:34,311 --> 02:38:38,330
And it's only in the recent years that 
it started to make sense where we've,

3347
02:38:38,331 --> 02:38:41,720
we've evolved the,
the eyes to be able to see this.

3348
02:38:41,930 --> 02:38:43,580
And so now by going out here with a 
drum,

3349
02:38:43,590 --> 02:38:44,423
I've been over this landscape several 
times in a small plane to see it from 

3350
02:38:47,451 --> 02:38:49,550
that perspective.
But now,

3351
02:38:49,700 --> 02:38:51,980
like he just said,
like graeme just said,

3352
02:38:51,981 --> 02:38:53,030
now we've got a drone.

3353
02:38:53,030 --> 02:38:55,700
It can go up and see it from a whole 
different perspective.

3354
02:38:56,040 --> 02:38:57,320
And,
and now you can see,

3355
02:38:57,530 --> 02:39:00,010
see the,
see the man standing right down there on

3356
02:39:00,011 --> 02:39:01,210
the rock.
No.

3357
02:39:01,690 --> 02:39:02,523
Oh,
that little dude.

3358
02:39:02,760 --> 02:39:04,470
Yeah.
Yeah.

3359
02:39:04,730 --> 02:39:07,130
That little,
that little dude is six feet tall.

3360
02:39:07,131 --> 02:39:08,870
He's not that little.
I mean,

3361
02:39:08,871 --> 02:39:10,670
on the picture.
He's a little now.

3362
02:39:10,700 --> 02:39:11,511
No.
In real life,

3363
02:39:11,511 --> 02:39:15,080
these are rs four inches and it's,
it's,

3364
02:39:15,230 --> 02:39:17,520
it's an illusion.
What's to me,

3365
02:39:17,521 --> 02:39:20,060
stunning.
I mean this is really beautiful and cool

3366
02:39:20,061 --> 02:39:20,894
and everything like that,
but what's really stunning as the 

3367
02:39:21,831 --> 02:39:25,940
initial picture where it becomes so 
obvious that above picture where you see

3368
02:39:25,941 --> 02:39:29,060
the farm land and that just,
it's so obviously cut,

3369
02:39:29,090 --> 02:39:30,970
cut,
slice out of the landscape.

3370
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:34,760
I see the rest of it then as as the 
drone flies over.

3371
02:39:34,790 --> 02:39:35,660
Yeah.
So,

3372
02:39:36,200 --> 02:39:39,140
and then we have what's called classic 
scab land.

3373
02:39:39,160 --> 02:39:41,240
You see all these mounds,
he's kind of lumps.

3374
02:39:41,690 --> 02:39:44,270
That's what,
what are the scabs on the scab land?

3375
02:39:44,480 --> 02:39:46,160
That's why it's called scab land.
And again,

3376
02:39:46,161 --> 02:39:50,660
it's flooding that causes it plucking,
plucking material off the surface.

3377
02:39:51,590 --> 02:39:53,900
Wow.
This is incredible.

3378
02:39:53,901 --> 02:39:55,790
And then there's water remaining.
Yeah,

3379
02:39:55,791 --> 02:39:57,680
they fill fill the potholes.
Yeah.

3380
02:39:57,740 --> 02:39:59,050
God,
it's there.

3381
02:39:59,060 --> 02:40:00,430
You get a song.
My God.

3382
02:40:00,431 --> 02:40:03,350
Are you get a sense of the Rock Blade?
Well they,

3383
02:40:03,351 --> 02:40:04,184
you get a sense of what the volume of 
water must have looked like when it was 

3384
02:40:06,351 --> 02:40:07,730
rushing through there.
Right.

3385
02:40:07,760 --> 02:40:11,300
And see this is just holy shit.
We've looked at two features now,

3386
02:40:11,301 --> 02:40:13,650
camera's prairie and potholes cataract.

3387
02:40:14,670 --> 02:40:15,503
We could sit here for the next 10 hours 
looking at dozens and dozens of these 

3388
02:40:18,871 --> 02:40:21,230
mega features.
And you'll look at,

3389
02:40:21,240 --> 02:40:25,080
there's a whole bar.
This is a gravel bar down here.

3390
02:40:25,140 --> 02:40:26,230
Over there.
Okay.

3391
02:40:26,530 --> 02:40:28,170
See,
see the giant rep was on it.

3392
02:40:28,560 --> 02:40:29,730
You see those?
Yeah.

3393
02:40:30,360 --> 02:40:32,250
I've never seen those reported in the 
literature.

3394
02:40:32,251 --> 02:40:33,084
It may be that nobody's ever seen really
seen him before or no one's ever paid 

3395
02:40:36,451 --> 02:40:37,810
attention.
Nobody's ever paid attempt,

3396
02:40:37,850 --> 02:40:39,390
but there they are.
So how,

3397
02:40:39,391 --> 02:40:41,940
what does mainstream science use to 
describe this?

3398
02:40:42,090 --> 02:40:42,923
This sort of or mainstream archeology 
used to describe these features should 

3399
02:40:45,841 --> 02:40:47,660
be geology.
Well,

3400
02:40:47,670 --> 02:40:49,620
catastrophic archeology.
Yeah.

3401
02:40:49,680 --> 02:40:50,730
What?
What would they,

3402
02:40:50,731 --> 02:40:52,350
so they believe this is catastrophic 
flooding is,

3403
02:40:52,380 --> 02:40:53,820
Oh,
you just think it's a slower,

3404
02:40:54,220 --> 02:40:56,790
I think it's lots of small catastrophic 
floods that not,

3405
02:40:56,791 --> 02:40:58,770
not one,
not one big catastrophic flood.

3406
02:40:58,980 --> 02:40:59,813
And how,
what kind of timeline are these 

3407
02:41:00,931 --> 02:41:02,040
geologists putting on us?

3408
02:41:02,070 --> 02:41:03,720
Oh,
two or 3000 years.

3409
02:41:03,740 --> 02:41:05,340
Yeah.
And why did they think that?

3410
02:41:05,640 --> 02:41:06,540
Well,
because of the,

3411
02:41:06,541 --> 02:41:07,374
the,
the ice damned model and how much time 

3412
02:41:09,601 --> 02:41:10,434
it would take.
See it gets complicated because until 

3413
02:41:14,101 --> 02:41:17,510
the commit research,
there was no credible source of,

3414
02:41:17,511 --> 02:41:18,344
uh,
of heat that could melt that amount of 

3415
02:41:19,471 --> 02:41:20,304
ice and close that up.
Now that's the new factor that's come 

3416
02:41:21,941 --> 02:41:24,020
into the equation.
Now you look at,

3417
02:41:24,040 --> 02:41:26,370
look at the people standing on the cliff
edge there,

3418
02:41:26,371 --> 02:41:28,260
the edge of the rock.
Would you see him down there?

3419
02:41:28,370 --> 02:41:31,230
Yeah.
So now you get the sense of scale.

3420
02:41:31,260 --> 02:41:33,810
What would survive again in the 
aftermath?

3421
02:41:33,840 --> 02:41:34,673
Not that dude.
So,

3422
02:41:34,770 --> 02:41:35,603
no,
not that dude.

3423
02:41:37,320 --> 02:41:39,720
Not Dad.
You or his buddies.

3424
02:41:39,810 --> 02:41:41,970
Yeah.
This is the crazy place,

3425
02:41:41,971 --> 02:41:43,230
man.
It's crazy to look at.

3426
02:41:44,070 --> 02:41:46,710
It's just so when you were looking above
it,

3427
02:41:46,890 --> 02:41:48,120
like even here,
I mean,

3428
02:41:48,300 --> 02:41:49,133
you get a sense of it,
but if you had just showed this to make 

3429
02:41:50,731 --> 02:41:51,564
quite honestly,
I probably wouldn't have put piece that 

3430
02:41:53,311 --> 02:41:54,144
together.

3431
02:41:54,840 --> 02:41:56,610
But when you look at it,
the original image,

3432
02:41:56,640 --> 02:41:59,180
it's so blatantly obvious.
Well that's,

3433
02:41:59,210 --> 02:42:01,980
that's the thing now is we are in this 
position where we can,

3434
02:42:02,070 --> 02:42:04,680
we can see it and when I take people out
in the field,

3435
02:42:04,681 --> 02:42:05,514
what I do is I,
I prep them first by showing these 

3436
02:42:09,091 --> 02:42:10,820
images from NASA,
the,

3437
02:42:10,970 --> 02:42:13,640
the satellite photography to Google 
Earth imagery,

3438
02:42:13,800 --> 02:42:17,130
aerial photography,
then ground photography.

3439
02:42:17,131 --> 02:42:17,964
And then you go out in the landscape and
at that point you can start having this 

3440
02:42:21,181 --> 02:42:23,040
framework for understanding what you're 
seeing.

3441
02:42:23,400 --> 02:42:26,430
Otherwise you just don't it,
the scale of it is too vast.

3442
02:42:26,940 --> 02:42:28,890
It's amazing.
It's really amazing.

3443
02:42:29,340 --> 02:42:33,360
You know,
this is an adventure of exploration that

3444
02:42:33,361 --> 02:42:33,990
we're,
we're,

3445
02:42:33,990 --> 02:42:36,840
we're just getting launched on this is,
this is recovering,

3446
02:42:37,470 --> 02:42:39,900
recovering the last,
the last past of,

3447
02:42:39,960 --> 02:42:41,760
of humanity.
And if I may,

3448
02:42:41,761 --> 02:42:45,420
I want to make a pitch again for the 
comments for the comic research group.

3449
02:42:45,480 --> 02:42:47,610
If anybody,
I think it's really important.

3450
02:42:47,611 --> 02:42:48,444
It's not,
it's not just a matter of funding their 

3451
02:42:50,371 --> 02:42:51,204
research.
It's also a matter of sending a message 

3452
02:42:53,310 --> 02:42:54,143
that we,
the people are prepared to take matters 

3453
02:42:55,981 --> 02:42:56,814
into our own hands and,
and support those scientists who are 

3454
02:43:00,151 --> 02:43:03,330
working with open minds inquiring into 
the past.

3455
02:43:03,630 --> 02:43:04,700
And whether,
you know,

3456
02:43:04,710 --> 02:43:08,250
give a dollar or $100 or whatever,
any little counts.

3457
02:43:08,251 --> 02:43:09,084
It,
it says it's the voice of the people as 

3458
02:43:10,501 --> 02:43:12,340
much as the,
that really,

3459
02:43:12,340 --> 02:43:13,780
that really matters.
These guys,

3460
02:43:13,781 --> 02:43:16,000
the common research group,
they need their research funding.

3461
02:43:16,001 --> 02:43:18,640
They have an Indiegogo crowdfunding 
campaign.

3462
02:43:18,641 --> 02:43:22,360
You can go to my website,
press the comet research group banner.

3463
02:43:22,361 --> 02:43:25,090
It will take you to a page with all the 
relevant links.

3464
02:43:25,270 --> 02:43:27,460
Please consider supporting it.
It's valid,

3465
02:43:27,461 --> 02:43:28,294
it's worthwhile,
it's worth the work and it has the 

3466
02:43:29,621 --> 02:43:33,760
potential to change the whole story of 
our past and our future.

3467
02:43:33,970 --> 02:43:38,250
It's a story that would be incredibly 
exciting to be a part of.

3468
02:43:38,910 --> 02:43:40,890
And that's what I'm trying to get people
to think,

3469
02:43:40,930 --> 02:43:41,763
look,
there's this thing happening and it 

3470
02:43:42,661 --> 02:43:43,494
really,
it is democratic in its own way and you 

3471
02:43:45,691 --> 02:43:46,524
don't have to be some specialist or a 
thorough particular authority in some 

3472
02:43:50,401 --> 02:43:51,234
branch of academically approved science 
to begin to appreciate and understand 

3473
02:43:55,741 --> 02:43:56,574
this and you're a human being getting 
out into the field and seeing this kind 

3474
02:43:59,191 --> 02:44:00,530
of stuff firsthand.
Um,

3475
02:44:00,870 --> 02:44:03,120
getting it into the discussion and to 
debate and,

3476
02:44:03,121 --> 02:44:05,310
and spending more time on this because 
it's,

3477
02:44:05,580 --> 02:44:07,620
it's such an interesting story

3478
02:44:07,710 --> 02:44:08,543
and that's what the scientists,
that the comment research group or 

3479
02:44:10,051 --> 02:44:10,890
offering that,
that,

3480
02:44:10,891 --> 02:44:13,710
that people who contribute,
we'll participate in certain ways.

3481
02:44:13,711 --> 02:44:14,000
Yeah.

3482
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:14,960
That's awesome.
The future.

3483
02:44:15,140 --> 02:44:15,481
Well,
we're,

3484
02:44:15,481 --> 02:44:16,314
we're all,
what I was going to say is we're all 

3485
02:44:16,731 --> 02:44:18,350
human beings.
We're a part of this planet.

3486
02:44:18,351 --> 02:44:22,340
We are pedestrians walking along at the,
on that were,

3487
02:44:22,370 --> 02:44:26,390
were being carried by this planet and 
all this stuff is all right.

3488
02:44:26,420 --> 02:44:27,253
It's,
it's your right to understand what the 

3489
02:44:28,640 --> 02:44:31,700
history of this crazy rock has gone 
through.

3490
02:44:31,760 --> 02:44:33,050
Absolutely.
This is amazing.

3491
02:44:33,090 --> 02:44:34,220
Yes.
Amazing stuff.

3492
02:44:34,221 --> 02:44:36,680
Into perspective.
To understand this is like this.

3493
02:44:36,920 --> 02:44:38,570
For 12,000
years,

3494
02:44:38,630 --> 02:44:39,463
this story has been written into the 
landscape of the earth and only now are 

3495
02:44:44,541 --> 02:44:48,550
we able to step back and begin to see 
the big picture in,

3496
02:44:48,710 --> 02:44:53,710
in tandem with ever greater detail and 
what's emerging is really,

3497
02:44:55,310 --> 02:44:56,143
it's a really wild tale,
but the evidence is there to support it 

3498
02:44:58,881 --> 02:44:59,410
complete.

3499
02:44:59,410 --> 02:45:00,990
Wait and this is,
I mean,

3500
02:45:00,991 --> 02:45:01,824
this is,
if,

3501
02:45:01,890 --> 02:45:03,810
this is what I've,
this is the story I've told him,

3502
02:45:03,811 --> 02:45:05,040
magicians of the gods,
this is,

3503
02:45:05,041 --> 02:45:07,110
this is recovering this,
this last memory.

3504
02:45:07,410 --> 02:45:08,800
It really is wild.
Um,

3505
02:45:08,940 --> 02:45:09,450
the,
our,

3506
02:45:09,450 --> 02:45:14,450
our time here on this planet has been 
confusing for so many reasons and one of

3507
02:45:15,421 --> 02:45:18,240
the big ones is not a not understanding 
how we got here.

3508
02:45:18,241 --> 02:45:21,360
And that's one of the reasons why your 
book I think is so important to me.

3509
02:45:21,510 --> 02:45:25,290
Just give you this new perspective of 
how this sort of civilization emerged.

3510
02:45:25,740 --> 02:45:27,780
Another problem I think we deal with all
the time,

3511
02:45:27,930 --> 02:45:29,160
uh,
is light pollution.

3512
02:45:29,430 --> 02:45:31,320
I think light pollution,
if I see the stars,

3513
02:45:31,350 --> 02:45:32,183
it's,
I think it's really a perspective 

3514
02:45:33,661 --> 02:45:35,070
blocker in a big way.

3515
02:45:35,730 --> 02:45:36,260
No,
it absolutely,

3516
02:45:36,260 --> 02:45:37,093
it absolutely is rattled.
And I were having a discussion earlier 

3517
02:45:39,271 --> 02:45:43,140
about how ancient cultures related to 
the cosmos as above.

3518
02:45:43,141 --> 02:45:46,020
So below they felt sls connected with 
the cosmos.

3519
02:45:46,021 --> 02:45:49,680
They made their monuments in alignment 
with key celestial bodies.

3520
02:45:49,980 --> 02:45:50,813
They did it very carefully.
There was a sense of bringing down the 

3521
02:45:53,610 --> 02:45:55,580
enchantment of the heavens onto,
on,

3522
02:45:55,610 --> 02:45:57,960
onto earth.
In modern societies,

3523
02:45:57,961 --> 02:46:00,480
we can't even see the stars.
He live in the middle of the big city.

3524
02:46:00,660 --> 02:46:02,370
The stars are gone.
The light,

3525
02:46:02,371 --> 02:46:04,080
the light pollution just blocks them 
out.

3526
02:46:04,090 --> 02:46:04,923
You never think they're there and you 
forget actually that you're part of a 

3527
02:46:07,591 --> 02:46:10,190
majestic cosmos.
The everything about

3528
02:46:10,190 --> 02:46:11,023
it is mystery.
We are immersed in mystery from the 

3529
02:46:12,951 --> 02:46:13,784
moment we're born to the moment we're 
die and yet our society is telling us 

3530
02:46:16,341 --> 02:46:17,174
how it's all very prosaic and dull and 
it's just about production and 

3531
02:46:19,101 --> 02:46:20,530
consumption explained.
She,

3532
02:46:20,550 --> 02:46:21,383
you don't really need to worry yourself 
about it too much cause some authority 

3533
02:46:23,931 --> 02:46:26,780
somewhere has it all figured out and no 
one has it all figured out.

3534
02:46:26,781 --> 02:46:27,614
It's not possible.
I think everybody owes it to themselves 

3535
02:46:29,751 --> 02:46:32,870
to go out into the desert in the middle 
of when,

3536
02:46:32,871 --> 02:46:33,704
when you know there's a stretch where 
the moon is not going to be out and 

3537
02:46:35,780 --> 02:46:36,613
there's going to be clear skies,
especially if you live in southern 

3538
02:46:38,391 --> 02:46:39,224
California,
you can get out to the desert pretty 

3539
02:46:40,011 --> 02:46:40,610
easy.
Yeah,

3540
02:46:40,610 --> 02:46:41,443
just get out away from all the cities 
and just look up and it'll freak you 

3541
02:46:43,581 --> 02:46:45,210
out.
It'll freak you out because it's,

3542
02:46:45,211 --> 02:46:46,044
it's one of those things that you kind 
of really take for granted because most 

3543
02:46:48,681 --> 02:46:53,060
of the time the sky is just a,
a dark black featureless thing.

3544
02:46:53,090 --> 02:46:54,890
The little couple little white dots that
don't,

3545
02:46:54,891 --> 02:46:55,724
aren't really that compelling.
When you get out there and you see the 

3546
02:46:57,261 --> 02:46:58,880
actual Milky Way itself,
you go,

3547
02:46:58,940 --> 02:47:01,490
Oh holy shit.
We'll see.

3548
02:47:01,491 --> 02:47:02,930
Now we could have,
you know,

3549
02:47:03,320 --> 02:47:04,153
every year there's probably a dozen high
altitude events that could have been 

3550
02:47:07,881 --> 02:47:11,240
witnessed by ancient peoples that we are
completely oblivious to.

3551
02:47:11,290 --> 02:47:11,931
Right.
Because of the,

3552
02:47:11,931 --> 02:47:12,764
our urban existence because of light 
pollution because nobody is really 

3553
02:47:15,441 --> 02:47:16,274
looking at the sky.
But these high altitude events would be 

3554
02:47:18,441 --> 02:47:23,441
essentially equivalent to like here or 
she Shima sized bombs going off 20 miles

3555
02:47:24,171 --> 02:47:26,190
up and just outside.
Yeah.

3556
02:47:26,320 --> 02:47:27,153
It was basically like if it's in the 
daytime and you're not looking right up 

3557
02:47:29,481 --> 02:47:30,220
there,
that's right.

3558
02:47:30,220 --> 02:47:33,890
You're not going to say daytime and at 
night if you're living in the city,

3559
02:47:33,891 --> 02:47:37,820
if you're inside the light pollution,
by the time it happens,

3560
02:47:37,821 --> 02:47:38,360
it's over.

3561
02:47:38,360 --> 02:47:42,470
But if you're out in a completely 
wilderness area where you've got,

3562
02:47:43,600 --> 02:47:44,433
you know,
visual access to the stars and you're 

3563
02:47:46,431 --> 02:47:50,270
aware of that and you're constantly 
aware of the presence of the sky,

3564
02:47:50,510 --> 02:47:53,150
you're going to see much more of that 
kind of thing happening.

3565
02:47:53,690 --> 02:47:57,410
Then if the cosmos decides to get a 
little bit more active,

3566
02:47:57,440 --> 02:47:59,750
which it apparently does from time to 
time,

3567
02:48:00,050 --> 02:48:02,760
suddenly the sky is now,
uh,

3568
02:48:02,810 --> 02:48:06,200
becomes a major factor in your,
in your existence,

3569
02:48:06,230 --> 02:48:08,600
your tribal existence,
your cultural existence.

3570
02:48:08,830 --> 02:48:12,290
Um,
especially if in those episodes you have

3571
02:48:12,291 --> 02:48:13,640
multiple,
um,

3572
02:48:13,900 --> 02:48:17,650
fireball type of ants that could be on 
the scale of anywhere from [inaudible],

3573
02:48:17,750 --> 02:48:21,200
Guppta Tin Goose.
And that's what clue in napier.

3574
02:48:21,620 --> 02:48:24,340
That's their scenario is these clusters 
of,

3575
02:48:24,550 --> 02:48:25,383
of that we enter episodes have been 
bodman when we up tossing through a 

3576
02:48:29,361 --> 02:48:30,194
filament of the tour,
had meteor stream that's thick with 

3577
02:48:31,731 --> 02:48:32,564
heavy debris,
asteroids have a kilometer of more in 

3578
02:48:34,581 --> 02:48:35,414
diameter.

3579
02:48:35,700 --> 02:48:36,533
Uh,
when we entered those filaments were 

3580
02:48:37,910 --> 02:48:40,040
entering a period of episodic 
bombardment.

3581
02:48:40,041 --> 02:48:43,910
When human civilization is at risk and 
according to their calculations,

3582
02:48:43,911 --> 02:48:47,020
we are entering one of those filaments 
in the next 30 years.

3583
02:48:47,060 --> 02:48:47,893
Jesus.
And that's why we need to pay attention 

3584
02:48:49,971 --> 02:48:53,000
to this because 30 years is enough time 
to do something about it.

3585
02:48:53,001 --> 02:48:55,340
If we apply the resources of our 
civilization to this,

3586
02:48:55,341 --> 02:48:56,174
we can solve this problem.
Let's look at a couple more pictures 

3587
02:49:01,370 --> 02:49:02,730
cause I'd like to get the picture of 
Graham.

3588
02:49:02,731 --> 02:49:06,380
I want it too busy making new phones.
They don't have time to fix the asteroid

3589
02:49:06,381 --> 02:49:07,280
thing.
Exactly.

3590
02:49:07,580 --> 02:49:08,430
Need a photo.

3591
02:49:08,520 --> 02:49:10,260
Projects,
images and holograms.

3592
02:49:10,470 --> 02:49:11,303
That's my uh,
my contention and it's going to take a 

3593
02:49:13,241 --> 02:49:14,820
little bit,
but again,

3594
02:49:14,821 --> 02:49:19,020
those are know the serious commercial 
talk of mining asteroids than is that is

3595
02:49:19,021 --> 02:49:20,370
the way into this.
That if they can,

3596
02:49:20,400 --> 02:49:21,233
if they can,
if they can see an economic return for 

3597
02:49:22,621 --> 02:49:23,454
them in that,
then maybe they'll do the good thing 

3598
02:49:24,331 --> 02:49:27,090
actually for the human race.
This have to be a manned expedition like

3599
02:49:27,091 --> 02:49:29,430
Bruce Willis and then asteroid movie not
necessary.

3600
02:49:29,520 --> 02:49:30,130
Okay.

3601
02:49:30,130 --> 02:49:31,600
What's the image that will show?
Well,

3602
02:49:31,630 --> 02:49:33,040
uh,
Jamie,

3603
02:49:33,041 --> 02:49:34,320
why don't you go to the,
the,

3604
02:49:34,330 --> 02:49:37,420
the folder of the one we opened that 
folder of Awesomeness,

3605
02:49:37,480 --> 02:49:39,760
the bolt,
a folder.

3606
02:49:40,170 --> 02:49:41,770
A folder of awesome.
This.

3607
02:49:41,771 --> 02:49:42,604
Yeah.
Just let's start with a one zero zero 

3608
02:49:44,261 --> 02:49:47,380
seven what are we going to look at here?
Well,

3609
02:49:47,381 --> 02:49:49,330
we're going to look at some NASA stuff.
Oh,

3610
02:49:49,331 --> 02:49:50,164
cool.
And then we'll look at a couple of 

3611
02:49:50,981 --> 02:49:55,810
google earth things and then we will 
look at a couple of us geological survey

3612
02:49:55,811 --> 02:49:58,210
things and then we'll look at some 
photographs.

3613
02:49:59,860 --> 02:50:01,170
Five deals worth.
Okay,

3614
02:50:01,190 --> 02:50:03,850
let's do it.
Holy Shit,

3615
02:50:04,030 --> 02:50:04,863
this is,
this is an early one of the early NASA 

3616
02:50:06,461 --> 02:50:09,680
photographs taken from 500 miles up,
uh,

3617
02:50:09,880 --> 02:50:12,010
back in the late seventies,
actually.

3618
02:50:12,280 --> 02:50:13,113
And what we got here is the two big scab
land tracts that show two of the big 

3619
02:50:17,831 --> 02:50:22,270
meltwater streams that have left their,
their scars in the landscape.

3620
02:50:22,570 --> 02:50:24,640
So each one of those,
um,

3621
02:50:25,000 --> 02:50:28,210
is very roughly between 10 and 20 miles 
wide.

3622
02:50:28,480 --> 02:50:32,530
And the bigger one on the right is 
probably 50 to 60 miles long,

3623
02:50:32,531 --> 02:50:33,364
or actually a little bit longer net.
But you can actually see that when the 

3624
02:50:36,731 --> 02:50:39,580
water swept down from the north out of 
British Columbia,

3625
02:50:39,760 --> 02:50:40,593
it washed away 200 feet,
roughly one to 200 feet of the existing 

3626
02:50:44,891 --> 02:50:48,430
top soil that had covered the basalt 
bedrock,

3627
02:50:48,580 --> 02:50:50,530
right.
Basalt bedrock by the way,

3628
02:50:50,531 --> 02:50:52,360
that was originally formed by,
uh,

3629
02:50:52,810 --> 02:50:55,870
eruptions of the Yellow Stone Caldera 
interestingly,

3630
02:50:56,140 --> 02:50:59,560
but so the water came down,
swept away the,

3631
02:50:59,561 --> 02:51:00,370
the,
um,

3632
02:51:00,370 --> 02:51:04,240
the topsoil and left the bear dark 
basalt exposed,

3633
02:51:04,510 --> 02:51:05,590
uh,
down below.

3634
02:51:06,010 --> 02:51:11,010
The feature that we just looked at is 
not even really in Nis NASA photograph.

3635
02:51:11,081 --> 02:51:14,590
It's over to the west.
But let's go ahead to the next one,

3636
02:51:14,860 --> 02:51:17,890
Jamie with the snake river down there,
which is,

3637
02:51:17,930 --> 02:51:20,080
um,
where's the snake river?

3638
02:51:20,320 --> 02:51:25,060
Snake River comes up out of Idaho and it
joins the Columbia and then flows out to

3639
02:51:25,061 --> 02:51:26,080
the Pacific Ocean.

3640
02:51:27,870 --> 02:51:28,703
All right.
Then we got a google earth image coming 

3641
02:51:30,121 --> 02:51:30,954
up.

3642
02:51:33,230 --> 02:51:33,840
Oh,
okay.

3643
02:51:33,840 --> 02:51:35,820
Want to order cause there's just a lot,
there's a lot in here.

3644
02:51:36,150 --> 02:51:36,960
Oh,
okay.

3645
02:51:36,960 --> 02:51:38,590
Well tell me which number you want me to
pull up.

3646
02:51:38,630 --> 02:51:42,240
Pull up we 1008 one zero zero eight.
The next one.

3647
02:51:42,630 --> 02:51:44,820
What's going on with our TV?
It keeps going off and on.

3648
02:51:45,300 --> 02:51:47,520
That CV is not really made for the way 
we use it,

3649
02:51:47,521 --> 02:51:48,354
so it doesn't like the inputs.
I just turned it off so I can pull up 

3650
02:51:50,911 --> 02:51:52,200
the next one.
Okay.

3651
02:51:53,070 --> 02:51:54,340
Hmm.
Hmm.

3652
02:51:58,120 --> 02:51:58,953
There we go.
So now we're getting actually a bigger 

3653
02:52:01,241 --> 02:52:02,860
view of,
of the landscape.

3654
02:52:02,861 --> 02:52:07,430
And you can see the two meltwater.
That's a scab land tracks,

3655
02:52:07,810 --> 02:52:12,680
I mean here and here.
And then you have what's called green.

3656
02:52:12,720 --> 02:52:15,460
No one can hear you if you do this.
Is this,

3657
02:52:15,490 --> 02:52:16,720
just tell me where it is.
I get it.

3658
02:52:16,750 --> 02:52:19,230
Okay.
So there's the two scab land track.

3659
02:52:19,720 --> 02:52:22,210
Then you've got the uh,
Grand Coulee,

3660
02:52:22,211 --> 02:52:26,290
which has that dark room and going up to
Columbia river there.

3661
02:52:26,530 --> 02:52:29,680
Grand Coulee dam is right almost.
You almost had it.

3662
02:52:29,681 --> 02:52:33,280
It's where the Columbia river suddenly 
gets skinny right there.

3663
02:52:33,281 --> 02:52:35,320
That's grand coulee dam.
That's the widest,

3664
02:52:35,560 --> 02:52:37,780
the most massive concrete dam in North 
America.

3665
02:52:38,230 --> 02:52:39,063
And it's impounding water.
And Franklin Delano Roosevelt Lake to 

3666
02:52:41,171 --> 02:52:45,790
about 400 feet deep right now.
All of the area at the top,

3667
02:52:45,791 --> 02:52:47,660
the glacier,
the green mountainous area.

3668
02:52:47,680 --> 02:52:51,700
This was all covered in ice and then 
over to the left,

3669
02:52:52,000 --> 02:52:52,833
right there you have that Brown area and
do you see the kind of semicircular arc 

3670
02:52:57,250 --> 02:52:59,170
of dark ground right there?

3671
02:52:59,170 --> 02:53:00,003
Yes.
That is where a tongue of the ice came 

3672
02:53:03,461 --> 02:53:07,540
out of Canada and it stopped right there
and when it receded,

3673
02:53:07,541 --> 02:53:09,190
when it melted,
melted back,

3674
02:53:09,640 --> 02:53:13,840
what it did was it left all this rubble 
that can't really be farmed effectively.

3675
02:53:14,170 --> 02:53:17,230
This it's called tail glacial till and 
where the glacier,

3676
02:53:17,260 --> 02:53:19,780
where the glacier and did,
that's called more Maureen,

3677
02:53:19,810 --> 02:53:20,643
Maureen,
and you can see it's circular where the 

3678
02:53:23,111 --> 02:53:26,710
glacier came and then coming right off 
the snout of the glacier.

3679
02:53:26,711 --> 02:53:27,544
Do you see kind of up a ribbony that's a
giant scar on the landscape that was 

3680
02:53:31,541 --> 02:53:35,710
formed by a meltwater stream coming off 
of that ice sheet.

3681
02:53:35,711 --> 02:53:37,180
It's called Moses Cooley.

3682
02:53:37,350 --> 02:53:38,183
Hey Randall,
I think we should keep in mind a lot of 

3683
02:53:39,211 --> 02:53:42,840
the audience aren't actually seeing the 
visuals on this tape.

3684
02:53:42,960 --> 02:53:43,793
The takeaway is that all across the 
Pacific northwest is a landscape that 

3685
02:53:46,771 --> 02:53:50,970
has been utterly scarred and devastated 
by gigantic flood that took place.

3686
02:53:50,971 --> 02:53:51,804
12,008
it's left its marks everywhere and this 

3687
02:53:54,211 --> 02:53:54,641
is right.
Yeah,

3688
02:53:54,641 --> 02:53:54,690
right

3689
02:53:54,690 --> 02:53:57,090
near core de Lane,
so cordileone is from that.

3690
02:53:57,120 --> 02:53:59,640
That's the residue of this quarter lane 
right there.

3691
02:53:59,910 --> 02:54:00,743
If people go to the Geo cosmic rex 
website or the sacred geometry 

3692
02:54:04,501 --> 02:54:05,334
international website,
they can see most of the images that 

3693
02:54:07,351 --> 02:54:08,520
we're showing you.
You'll see it.

3694
02:54:08,521 --> 02:54:09,354
If they watched the youtube video,
they can watch it and hear you talk 

3695
02:54:11,161 --> 02:54:12,670
about it at the same time.
It's just the,

3696
02:54:12,810 --> 02:54:15,070
the vast majority,
probably 90% of our new,

3697
02:54:15,071 --> 02:54:15,904
but just seeing the visuals right now,
but they can and so they probably will 

3698
02:54:19,441 --> 02:54:20,274
so they can go to that and watch it.
You can look down way down on the lower 

3699
02:54:24,871 --> 02:54:28,140
left is the potholes cataract,
right.

3700
02:54:28,830 --> 02:54:32,940
Go up a little up along the river.
Come down south south,

3701
02:54:33,150 --> 02:54:35,160
keep coming,
keep coming.

3702
02:54:35,161 --> 02:54:37,800
Stop.
Look to the right of the river.

3703
02:54:37,890 --> 02:54:40,770
That's what we were just,
this man knows his landscapes.

3704
02:54:41,490 --> 02:54:44,130
To note to the right,
to the right to the right,

3705
02:54:44,131 --> 02:54:45,300
Jamie,
Jamie,

3706
02:54:45,301 --> 02:54:48,070
how dare you.
Yeah.

3707
02:54:48,090 --> 02:54:49,320
This,
this whole area.

3708
02:54:49,321 --> 02:54:50,670
So we get it.
This whole,

3709
02:54:50,671 --> 02:54:51,504
every area has been absolutely anon 
unequivocably undeniably you see this 

3710
02:54:56,281 --> 02:54:57,114
Joe,
and you realize the scale of what we 

3711
02:54:57,871 --> 02:54:58,704
just looked at and now you're seeing 
that within this whole landscape there 

3712
02:55:02,341 --> 02:55:04,880
was essentially inundated.
You're,

3713
02:55:04,940 --> 02:55:05,773
you'll start to get the,
the scale of the thing and that's what 

3714
02:55:07,671 --> 02:55:10,730
I'm trying to do here.
If you joke and get the scale of this in

3715
02:55:10,731 --> 02:55:12,800
your mind,
I've accomplished something.

3716
02:55:12,950 --> 02:55:15,410
I think I got it from that one image was
a,

3717
02:55:15,411 --> 02:55:17,620
that was a real mind blower.
The right bolts.

3718
02:55:17,630 --> 02:55:18,560
Yeah.
The ripples.

3719
02:55:18,561 --> 02:55:19,394
Yeah.
There were all the ripples were real 

3720
02:55:20,031 --> 02:55:20,864
mind blower and then the,
the other one with the farm land and 

3721
02:55:22,461 --> 02:55:24,650
then there's just massive channel cut 
into it.

3722
02:55:25,010 --> 02:55:25,880
You kind of get it.

3723
02:55:26,020 --> 02:55:26,670
Yeah.
Um,

3724
02:55:26,670 --> 02:55:30,020
the ripples aren't even on this image 
there their way to the east.

3725
02:55:30,021 --> 02:55:33,290
Has Anybody sat down with you and tried 
to dispute this?

3726
02:55:33,350 --> 02:55:37,040
I mean the people that believe that this
was a slow and gradual effect.

3727
02:55:37,041 --> 02:55:40,250
Does anybody sat down and tried to 
debate you on this?

3728
02:55:40,340 --> 02:55:41,173
No,
that seems like something that would be 

3729
02:55:42,171 --> 02:55:44,210
really interesting to debate.
I mean,

3730
02:55:44,211 --> 02:55:46,820
I would love to see someone who's a 
geologist that,

3731
02:55:47,050 --> 02:55:47,480
you know,
the,

3732
02:55:47,480 --> 02:55:48,313
I'm sure there's someone out there that 
is listening to this that may have a 

3733
02:55:51,021 --> 02:55:52,620
dispute with it.
There is,

3734
02:55:52,880 --> 02:55:54,290
I'm sure,
but I would love to,

3735
02:55:54,410 --> 02:55:55,243
I would love to see them talk to you 
about it and go over all the various 

3736
02:55:59,691 --> 02:56:02,870
things.
The nuclear glass that they find,

3737
02:56:02,871 --> 02:56:04,700
the uh,
I mean all of it,

3738
02:56:04,701 --> 02:56:06,560
all the top to bottom.
Here's the thing,

3739
02:56:06,561 --> 02:56:07,490
Joe,
at this point,

3740
02:56:07,491 --> 02:56:08,324
nobody is connecting the work of the,
of the comic research group with the 

3741
02:56:12,201 --> 02:56:14,020
Missoula flood effects that we're 
looking at or,

3742
02:56:14,040 --> 02:56:14,873
or rest.

3743
02:56:14,950 --> 02:56:16,880
Except except us.
That's crazy.

3744
02:56:17,450 --> 02:56:18,620
Most people were like,
that's crazy.

3745
02:56:18,621 --> 02:56:21,830
How's it possible?
Because it's such an obvious,

3746
02:56:21,860 --> 02:56:22,693
it's such an obvious connection and it 
really merits expos scares the shit out 

3747
02:56:25,371 --> 02:56:27,110
of me.
What if you guys didn't exist?

3748
02:56:27,470 --> 02:56:29,850
What if you guys would never born?
What if you never wrote that book?

3749
02:56:29,851 --> 02:56:32,510
And what if you never been freaking out 
about this shit your whole life?

3750
02:56:32,840 --> 02:56:36,920
How would I know about many times in the
human story as this happened where stuff

3751
02:56:36,921 --> 02:56:37,754
has just not been explored that really 
need to put the pet sounds crazy to 

3752
02:56:40,570 --> 02:56:43,040
something like a Michael Shermer to a 
skeptical person.

3753
02:56:43,250 --> 02:56:44,540
Well,
I say to Michael Shermer,

3754
02:56:44,541 --> 02:56:45,374
come on man,
let's go spend a week out in that 

3755
02:56:46,401 --> 02:56:48,350
landscape.
Well he does want to debate you.

3756
02:56:48,351 --> 02:56:50,480
He wants to sit down and debate you 
Graham.

3757
02:56:50,920 --> 02:56:51,890
Let's,
can we set that up?

3758
02:56:51,920 --> 02:56:52,753
We can set that up.

3759
02:56:52,820 --> 02:56:54,570
I will love it.
That sounds,

3760
02:56:55,250 --> 02:56:59,090
that sounds like it would be a good time
in my mind.

3761
02:56:59,091 --> 02:57:01,250
There's really no,
no arguing with with this,

3762
02:57:01,580 --> 02:57:03,800
this evidence,
I mean overwhelming.

3763
02:57:03,801 --> 02:57:04,634
And the question really comes down to at
this point nobody disputes that there 

3764
02:57:08,481 --> 02:57:12,110
were catastrophic flood.
The question is what was the mechanism?

3765
02:57:12,230 --> 02:57:14,370
How many were there?
How long would it take?

3766
02:57:14,960 --> 02:57:15,793
How long did it take?
Was it a bunch of catastrophic but 

3767
02:57:18,561 --> 02:57:23,561
smaller floods or was it back to Brett's
original model of one giant flood?

3768
02:57:24,080 --> 02:57:27,640
And I think the truth actually lies 
somewhere between the two and,

3769
02:57:27,641 --> 02:57:28,580
and it,
again,

3770
02:57:28,581 --> 02:57:29,414
the geology gets complicated,
but I'm writing it up so I will explain 

3771
02:57:33,080 --> 02:57:35,690
in detail what my thoughts are.
And after,

3772
02:57:35,691 --> 02:57:36,524
after having criss crossed thousands of 
miles of this landscape repeatedly and 

3773
02:57:41,301 --> 02:57:42,134
basically absorbed every piece of 
scientific literature every written on 

3774
02:57:45,621 --> 02:57:48,620
it,
I've evolved some ideas about what could

3775
02:57:48,621 --> 02:57:50,600
have happened here and how it happened.
Well,

3776
02:57:50,601 --> 02:57:54,740
I was a grown adult and I found out that
North America,

3777
02:57:54,920 --> 02:57:57,240
most of it was by,
you know,

3778
02:57:57,320 --> 02:57:58,400
what was it?
10 12,000

3779
02:57:58,401 --> 02:58:01,070
years ago was covered by a mile high 
sheet of ice.

3780
02:58:01,930 --> 02:58:02,480
Yes.

3781
02:58:02,480 --> 02:58:03,850
Odd.
I was a grown adult and I went,

3782
02:58:03,890 --> 02:58:06,150
well,
America roughly north of Minneapolis.

3783
02:58:06,151 --> 02:58:06,650
Yeah.
Yeah.

3784
02:58:06,650 --> 02:58:08,400
And that was,
that's common knowledge,

3785
02:58:08,401 --> 02:58:08,851
right?
I mean,

3786
02:58:08,851 --> 02:58:09,684
everybody knew that.
Anybody who's actually studied the 

3787
02:58:11,161 --> 02:58:11,994
history of it,
but it never made it to my dopey head 

3788
02:58:14,190 --> 02:58:15,930
until I was a grown adult.
And then I went,

3789
02:58:15,931 --> 02:58:16,770
wait a minute,
wait a minute,

3790
02:58:16,771 --> 02:58:20,190
wait a minute.
What the idea in my mind that this whole

3791
02:58:20,191 --> 02:58:23,520
thing was covered just 12,000
years ago.

3792
02:58:23,840 --> 02:58:26,820
It seems so incredibly recent.
And by the way,

3793
02:58:26,821 --> 02:58:27,654
that ice was more like two miles deep,
could consider the weight of those ice 

3794
02:58:31,471 --> 02:58:32,850
masses pressing down.
I mean,

3795
02:58:32,851 --> 02:58:33,684
anything that was there before the ice 
came down would have been ground to 

3796
02:58:36,451 --> 02:58:37,284
powder and then as the ice cataclysmic,
he melts everything below it is washed 

3797
02:58:41,011 --> 02:58:43,320
away forever so I can erase her for the 
world.

3798
02:58:44,220 --> 02:58:47,040
That's exactly,
that's a great phrase and eraser for the

3799
02:58:47,041 --> 02:58:47,400
world.

3800
02:58:47,400 --> 02:58:51,150
And that is the thing that so many of 
the skeptics haven't factored into their

3801
02:58:51,151 --> 02:58:52,500
thinking when you're going,
well,

3802
02:58:52,501 --> 02:58:55,740
where's the evidence?
The evidence is you've got to understand

3803
02:58:55,741 --> 02:58:56,574
is that we have to rethink the 
possibility of evidence once we know 

3804
02:59:00,121 --> 02:59:00,954
that there has been,
these are racers of the world that have 

3805
02:59:03,150 --> 02:59:06,150
transpired and,
and not just once,

3806
02:59:06,151 --> 02:59:06,984
but I mean what we're looking at here is
probably the most severe events in the 

3807
02:59:10,321 --> 02:59:14,730
last 5 million years and I have a reason
for using that number 5 million.

3808
02:59:14,880 --> 02:59:15,930
What's the reason?
Well,

3809
02:59:15,931 --> 02:59:18,090
the reason is is based upon the,
the,

3810
02:59:18,180 --> 02:59:19,013
the severity of the mass extinction.
We have to go back 5 million years to 

3811
02:59:22,201 --> 02:59:27,201
find an extinction event of an 
equivalent level as what occurred at the

3812
02:59:27,661 --> 02:59:28,494
younger dryas.
It's funny because what I would call a 

3813
02:59:30,031 --> 02:59:30,864
kneejerk skeptical person would always 
say that extraordinary claims require 

3814
02:59:33,301 --> 02:59:34,380
extraordinary evidence.

3815
02:59:34,620 --> 02:59:35,453
Is there anything more extraordinary 
than that image of those farmlands and 

3816
02:59:38,011 --> 02:59:40,980
that giant swath cut instead of land?
That's,

3817
02:59:41,070 --> 02:59:43,020
that is the,
what is it?

3818
02:59:43,530 --> 02:59:45,510
That's pretty right.
Pretty extraordinary.

3819
02:59:45,660 --> 02:59:46,493
And then the core samples,
the core samples that show this massive 

3820
02:59:49,171 --> 02:59:51,900
fluctuation of temperature and we've 
looked at,

3821
02:59:51,920 --> 02:59:52,753
yeah,
in pre gout that coincides with the 

3822
02:59:54,301 --> 02:59:55,830
melting of the ice.
Yes,

3823
02:59:55,831 --> 02:59:56,730
yes.
It's all there.

3824
02:59:57,270 --> 03:00:00,060
Obviously all leads,
even if someone like me,

3825
03:00:00,420 --> 03:00:04,260
it leads to an event and this 
cataclysmic episode immediately precedes

3826
03:00:04,261 --> 03:00:07,110
the time when we'd been told that 
civilization began.

3827
03:00:07,170 --> 03:00:08,820
Yeah.
That's the other point,

3828
03:00:08,821 --> 03:00:09,654
which is really important.
We had this huge punctuation mark and 

3829
03:00:11,491 --> 03:00:14,190
then civilization suddenly started to 
evolve.

3830
03:00:14,191 --> 03:00:15,600
No,
it was there before.

3831
03:00:15,601 --> 03:00:17,700
This is a reinvention.
Those hunter gatherers,

3832
03:00:17,701 --> 03:00:18,534
like those people that you would wash 
and one of those shows where they 

3833
03:00:19,741 --> 03:00:21,640
survive in Alaska.
Even watch those shows.

3834
03:00:21,650 --> 03:00:22,483
Yes,
this shows a great life below zero s 

3835
03:00:24,180 --> 03:00:27,420
crazy assholes and live in those people 
would make it.

3836
03:00:27,690 --> 03:00:30,540
Those people would make it and they 
would breed and they would carry on.

3837
03:00:30,740 --> 03:00:31,830
Yeah.
What does that,

3838
03:00:31,860 --> 03:00:32,693
what does it say?
1012 you could just say it next day and 

3839
03:00:35,721 --> 03:00:37,980
age.
I don't want to interrupt your Joe.

3840
03:00:38,010 --> 03:00:39,030
No worries.
No worries.

3841
03:00:39,330 --> 03:00:40,650
Look at this.
Wow.

3842
03:00:41,070 --> 03:00:42,120
Okay.
So that to me,

3843
03:00:42,121 --> 03:00:42,954
I'm looking at this after what you've 
told me that looks like water that is 

3844
03:00:45,541 --> 03:00:48,510
sort of like receded and left these 
lines and this hillside.

3845
03:00:48,830 --> 03:00:51,420
Thank thank you have a bath tub ring 
after Joe.

3846
03:00:51,421 --> 03:00:52,254
You get in there and you take a bath and
the water is basically brown with 

3847
03:00:54,991 --> 03:00:59,100
sediment.
[inaudible] the way you've taken tub,

3848
03:01:00,990 --> 03:01:03,070
you leave in sediment and your tub.
Hey man,

3849
03:01:03,080 --> 03:01:03,913
how'd your quoting genesis and the 
water's prevailed exceedingly upon the 

3850
03:01:07,091 --> 03:01:09,310
earth and all the high hills were 
cupboard.

3851
03:01:09,400 --> 03:01:10,470
Wow.

3852
03:01:10,550 --> 03:01:11,660
Because I'm,
you know,

3853
03:01:12,020 --> 03:01:14,840
trying to pump the biblical flood model 
and the far from it.

3854
03:01:15,170 --> 03:01:16,003
What I am trying to do is draw out 
pictures whenever I realized here's a 

3855
03:01:18,651 --> 03:01:19,484
great quote and it doesn't matter where 
it's from because there's so many flood 

3856
03:01:21,501 --> 03:01:22,690
legends you can quote from.

3857
03:01:22,750 --> 03:01:26,400
Well the biblical flood model is it is 
one of those,

3858
03:01:26,401 --> 03:01:27,234
Smith's is one of those traditions that 
have come to want to thousands of 

3859
03:01:29,681 --> 03:01:30,514
traditions that speak of this.
The whole ancestral memory of the human 

3860
03:01:33,641 --> 03:01:36,100
race is telling us that something 
terrible happened.

3861
03:01:36,160 --> 03:01:36,993
It's also very unfortunate.
That's all that's all connected with an 

3862
03:01:39,431 --> 03:01:42,890
ideology that a lot of people find 
problematic like that.

3863
03:01:42,891 --> 03:01:44,890
There's this issues with that being,
you know,

3864
03:01:44,900 --> 03:01:47,580
religion of course colt or there's a 
faith based beliefs.

3865
03:01:47,770 --> 03:01:48,603
We must have immediately realize the 
flood is not the property of the 

3866
03:01:50,711 --> 03:01:54,700
monotheistic religions that is found in 
every culture on it.

3867
03:01:54,820 --> 03:01:55,653
Also in that a lot of these stories 
you're talking about massive 

3868
03:01:57,521 --> 03:02:00,210
translations from ancient Hebrew to 
Latin.

3869
03:02:00,280 --> 03:02:04,150
The Greek and a lot is lost in the 
process and the you're dealing with.

3870
03:02:04,180 --> 03:02:05,013
A lot of these stories were handed down 
from generation to generation for like 

3871
03:02:07,661 --> 03:02:11,190
what was it like a thousand years before
the first version was ever ripped?

3872
03:02:11,191 --> 03:02:13,670
Sedately absolutely.
So all that's,

3873
03:02:13,671 --> 03:02:16,060
I mean that is unbelievably fascinating.

3874
03:02:16,710 --> 03:02:21,710
Go to 1014 one zero one four and we'll 
see a topographic map.

3875
03:02:24,690 --> 03:02:25,320
Ah,
yeah.

3876
03:02:25,320 --> 03:02:26,220
Whoa.

3877
03:02:27,910 --> 03:02:30,970
Now that you know,
it's like it's crazy.

3878
03:02:30,971 --> 03:02:31,804
It looks like something just wa like you
had a sand castle or some flat sand set 

3879
03:02:36,311 --> 03:02:40,000
up and a wave came in and cut through it
and then

3880
03:02:40,080 --> 03:02:40,913
pulled back.
The wave came from the north and it's 

3881
03:02:43,221 --> 03:02:44,054
swept down over the landscape and 
basically carved and plucked and 

3882
03:02:47,641 --> 03:02:48,474
quarried and gouged and Gash that 
landscape and this is one of the places 

3883
03:02:53,131 --> 03:02:54,930
Graham and I went.
If you look right in there,

3884
03:02:54,931 --> 03:02:58,200
you'll see where it says grand part of 
Grand Coulee,

3885
03:02:58,230 --> 03:02:59,063
G,
r a n d right there with the D is we 

3886
03:03:02,131 --> 03:03:02,964
have a great video clip online of me and
gray and we're looking at this actual 

3887
03:03:06,451 --> 03:03:11,370
Topo map right here and and then 
surveying the cataract around us.

3888
03:03:11,610 --> 03:03:12,443
You'll also notice that there's a rock 
blade just like similar to the one that 

3889
03:03:16,351 --> 03:03:17,184
we just saw on the drone footage.
See the Rock Lake and you recognize the 

3890
03:03:19,831 --> 03:03:21,870
alcoves now.
Yeah.

3891
03:03:22,290 --> 03:03:23,123
And if we go to the next one,
we have a google earth image of 1015 of 

3892
03:03:29,251 --> 03:03:30,084
this feature

3893
03:03:33,770 --> 03:03:38,540
and there's the Google Earth emh.
And for scale in the upper left hand,

3894
03:03:38,570 --> 03:03:42,620
I've super imposed Niagara Falls at the,
at the same scale.

3895
03:03:43,010 --> 03:03:46,190
So you can see by comparison.
Wow.

3896
03:03:46,430 --> 03:03:48,390
Have you been to Niagara Falls,
Joe?

3897
03:03:48,740 --> 03:03:51,530
I went when I was a little kid.
I honestly don't remember.

3898
03:03:51,560 --> 03:03:52,393
I think I went when I was a little kid.
I'll have to check with my mom on 

3899
03:03:54,370 --> 03:03:56,650
sensitive to see it.
But you could.

3900
03:03:56,780 --> 03:03:59,300
The here is that anybody looking at this
and you know,

3901
03:03:59,301 --> 03:04:01,110
if the folks look at the,
um,

3902
03:04:01,400 --> 03:04:05,180
the imagery on the online,
the biggest waterfalls in the world.

3903
03:04:06,110 --> 03:04:08,840
What Niagara?
Not In terms of volume.

3904
03:04:08,870 --> 03:04:09,703
No,
but nor in terms of the African or 

3905
03:04:10,871 --> 03:04:11,361
something.
Yeah.

3906
03:04:11,361 --> 03:04:14,090
Or South American.
Maybe Victoria Falls a Ted pans,

3907
03:04:14,091 --> 03:04:16,220
you know,
the highest or the greatest volume.

3908
03:04:16,480 --> 03:04:20,480
It's about 200,000
between 150 and 200,000

3909
03:04:20,481 --> 03:04:24,020
cubic feet per second going over those 
false depending on the f,

3910
03:04:24,110 --> 03:04:25,070
the flow of the river.

3911
03:04:25,520 --> 03:04:26,353
But the,
the flow that came through here was 

3912
03:04:27,771 --> 03:04:32,771
about 350 million cubic feet per second 
and left this and uh,

3913
03:04:33,890 --> 03:04:34,723
yeah,
if you go in line on the Geo cosmic rex 

3914
03:04:36,370 --> 03:04:37,203
website,
there's a video clip of me and Graham 

3915
03:04:39,560 --> 03:04:42,530
down there just just uh,
by perch lake.

3916
03:04:42,550 --> 03:04:43,880
May I ask you a question here?
Yeah.

3917
03:04:44,000 --> 03:04:48,710
Now if the water that was creating Grand
Canyon or the Niagara Falls rather right

3918
03:04:48,711 --> 03:04:51,560
up there,
if that all receded and we could see the

3919
03:04:51,561 --> 03:04:54,140
bottom,
wouldn't it look similar to what you see

3920
03:04:54,141 --> 03:04:56,990
in here?
The one of Grand Canyon?

3921
03:04:57,030 --> 03:04:57,863
No,
excuse me,

3922
03:04:57,890 --> 03:04:59,900
nine with Agora falls right there.
Right above it.

3923
03:04:59,901 --> 03:05:01,070
Right there.
Yes it would,

3924
03:05:01,071 --> 03:05:03,110
but on a smaller scale on a smaller 
scale,

3925
03:05:03,230 --> 03:05:04,063
but like on a smaller scale,
like some of the smaller features that 

3926
03:05:06,141 --> 03:05:07,340
you see right there,
right?

3927
03:05:07,341 --> 03:05:09,060
Yeah.
And that's the thing you were saying.

3928
03:05:09,061 --> 03:05:09,980
You're right,
it's fractal.

3929
03:05:10,130 --> 03:05:10,963
The interesting thing about water 
erosion and sedimentation is its scale 

3930
03:05:13,521 --> 03:05:14,354
in variant.
So you can look at features and coming 

3931
03:05:16,281 --> 03:05:17,114
up into pictures.
Here I've got a beautiful example of 

3932
03:05:18,621 --> 03:05:19,454
scale and variants where you see the 
small version and the large version and 

3933
03:05:22,341 --> 03:05:23,174
it's exactly the same thing.
That's why if you go into any geology 

3934
03:05:25,881 --> 03:05:26,714
text,
they've always got something in the 

3935
03:05:28,191 --> 03:05:32,270
photographs like a a rock pick or a 
person standing there.

3936
03:05:32,360 --> 03:05:35,330
Otherwise it's hard to get a sense of 
the scale of what you're looking at.

3937
03:05:35,930 --> 03:05:36,880
Right.
So my,

3938
03:05:36,910 --> 03:05:39,140
my question though was that if that's 
the case,

3939
03:05:39,141 --> 03:05:44,141
if you could drain Niagara Falls and it 
would have a similar feature set to what

3940
03:05:44,331 --> 03:05:45,710
you're seeing on the ground there.
Well,

3941
03:05:45,711 --> 03:05:48,020
we know that Niagara Falls has been 
doing that for a long,

3942
03:05:48,021 --> 03:05:48,854
long time.
Years of work of the river at night 

3943
03:05:50,780 --> 03:05:51,613
holes right here.
You're looking at a moment in time to 

3944
03:05:53,481 --> 03:05:54,860
unfold it in a few weeks.

3945
03:05:54,950 --> 03:05:56,210
Right?
But how do we know that?

3946
03:05:56,240 --> 03:05:58,010
Well for one thing to scale of it 
because if,

3947
03:05:58,140 --> 03:05:58,973
if,
if,

3948
03:05:59,150 --> 03:05:59,983
because in other words,
how long would it take Niagara to carve 

3949
03:06:04,191 --> 03:06:07,820
something on this scale?
If it's taken Niagara 10,000

3950
03:06:07,821 --> 03:06:09,770
years,
say to carve that,

3951
03:06:10,220 --> 03:06:13,130
how long would it take a equivalent flow
to carve this?

3952
03:06:13,400 --> 03:06:15,830
But it will look like if you drained it 
though,

3953
03:06:15,860 --> 03:06:18,560
what would it look like an equivalent to
any of these things right here.

3954
03:06:18,770 --> 03:06:19,603
For one thing,
it's not basalt bedrock so you're not 

3955
03:06:21,741 --> 03:06:24,470
going to see quite the same type of 
erosion because really what you,

3956
03:06:24,490 --> 03:06:25,323
what you've got to consider is that all 
different rock types of road 

3957
03:06:27,261 --> 03:06:29,030
differently.
Also.

3958
03:06:29,031 --> 03:06:30,200
Um,
you know,

3959
03:06:30,201 --> 03:06:31,034
what happens is you have regimes of flow
so that what you have in in Niagara 

3960
03:06:35,421 --> 03:06:36,254
today is a lower flow regime which 
doesn't have anywhere near the type of 

3961
03:06:40,611 --> 03:06:41,444
turbulence or erosive potential is when 
you get water moving at 50 or 60 miles 

3962
03:06:46,011 --> 03:06:46,700
an hour.

3963
03:06:46,700 --> 03:06:47,533
One reason we definitely can know that 
this is the case is because we see the 

3964
03:06:51,141 --> 03:06:53,450
association with the giant current 
ripples.

3965
03:06:53,690 --> 03:06:54,523
We see the boulders that have been 
plucked and quarried and some of them 

3966
03:06:57,181 --> 03:07:00,060
are 40 and 50 feet in diameter.
You see,

3967
03:07:00,120 --> 03:07:01,440
and we'll,
we'll look at some of those,

3968
03:07:01,860 --> 03:07:03,270
uh,
coming up in the next,

3969
03:07:03,570 --> 03:07:04,403
next picture.
Do you have that image that you were 

3970
03:07:05,671 --> 03:07:06,504
talking about before of that one 
gigantic boulder that was carried on 

3971
03:07:09,331 --> 03:07:10,290
this?
It's coming up.

3972
03:07:10,310 --> 03:07:11,880
Okay.
If we move quickly through here,

3973
03:07:11,881 --> 03:07:12,540
we'll,
we'll,

3974
03:07:12,540 --> 03:07:15,560
we'll get to it.
So go to go to um,

3975
03:07:16,260 --> 03:07:17,093
1017 and that will be from the ground 
view again with Niagara Falls super 

3976
03:07:21,561 --> 03:07:25,530
imposed for scale,
the horseshoe falls,

3977
03:07:25,531 --> 03:07:28,380
the Canadian falls superimposed for 
scale.

3978
03:07:28,381 --> 03:07:33,381
Now basically that cataract at horseshoe
falls is about 120 feet in height.

3979
03:07:34,860 --> 03:07:39,860
The cliff wall of this giant cataract 
has about 400 feet high and then you see

3980
03:07:40,111 --> 03:07:40,944
the beginning of the blade rock out 
there and the full extent of the thing 

3981
03:07:44,581 --> 03:07:47,010
actually goes all the way to the 
horizon,

3982
03:07:47,850 --> 03:07:49,500
but we can't see that beyond there.

3983
03:07:49,500 --> 03:07:50,333
But this erosion goes all the way to the
horizon to stone that cut into basalt 

3984
03:07:54,211 --> 03:07:55,044
hard columnar basalt that was extruded 
basically with the eruption of the 

3985
03:08:01,290 --> 03:08:02,123
Yellowstone Caldera.
Long mill 15 million years ago 

3986
03:08:05,010 --> 03:08:05,843
basically,
but then covered up by a couple of 

3987
03:08:08,340 --> 03:08:09,173
hundred feet of loss topsoil and then 
that was exposed when the floods came 

3988
03:08:12,151 --> 03:08:13,500
through.
Um,

3989
03:08:13,770 --> 03:08:14,603
go,
go to the next 1018 and you'll see an 

3990
03:08:18,091 --> 03:08:23,091
example of some of the debris that was 
left behind by the floodwaters when they

3991
03:08:23,461 --> 03:08:24,294
finally ceased.
There's the step that you're looking at 

3992
03:08:27,571 --> 03:08:28,404
now.
The bigger stuff there is 30 and 40 

3993
03:08:30,421 --> 03:08:31,500
feet.
Those,

3994
03:08:31,501 --> 03:08:33,660
it'd be like four story buildings down 
there.

3995
03:08:34,230 --> 03:08:37,880
So those are just washed away by this 
gigantic river that's just this,

3996
03:08:37,890 --> 03:08:41,070
this write,
this massive gigantic river moving 50,

3997
03:08:41,071 --> 03:08:41,904
60 miles an hour sweeps through their 
plucks and tears the bedrock and then 

3998
03:08:46,621 --> 03:08:47,454
wind up spigots finally get turned off.
The water starts subsiding and this 

3999
03:08:50,881 --> 03:08:53,940
stuff that's being carried in air just 
gets left into wake.

4000
03:08:53,970 --> 03:08:56,250
Just like you're going to see any 
modern,

4001
03:08:56,251 --> 03:08:58,920
smaller flood is going to leave material
in its wake.

4002
03:08:58,921 --> 03:09:02,460
The differences.
This material is piles of boulders,

4003
03:09:02,461 --> 03:09:04,500
the size of houses,
gravel bars,

4004
03:09:04,501 --> 03:09:07,440
two and 300 feet thick and three miles 
long,

4005
03:09:07,920 --> 03:09:09,150
and you're all in it.
So see,

4006
03:09:09,300 --> 03:09:11,670
here's the,
the answer to your question is,

4007
03:09:11,940 --> 03:09:12,773
and this is what,
how Brett's finally did it was by 

4008
03:09:14,161 --> 03:09:17,250
showing that it was the full suite of 
evidence.

4009
03:09:17,460 --> 03:09:18,293
Take an integrally that created a 
picture that was undeniable to the 

4010
03:09:21,451 --> 03:09:22,950
skeptics.
It was just,

4011
03:09:22,951 --> 03:09:27,951
it was overwhelming because it was every
piece fit together to perfectly to two.

4012
03:09:28,470 --> 03:09:33,120
And there was no other explanation other
than gigantic hydraulic events.

4013
03:09:33,780 --> 03:09:36,810
And,
and now it's a question of the detail,

4014
03:09:36,811 --> 03:09:38,910
what caused them,
how long did it take?

4015
03:09:39,330 --> 03:09:40,163
And you know,
that's where the controversy is now is 

4016
03:09:43,390 --> 03:09:46,050
amazing.
It's amazing and terrifying.

4017
03:09:46,051 --> 03:09:48,000
But what's cool about is it's 
terrifying,

4018
03:09:48,600 --> 03:09:51,520
but everything's okay right now.
Everything's okay right now now.

4019
03:09:51,700 --> 03:09:53,410
So it's like you feel,
ah,

4020
03:09:53,411 --> 03:09:54,190
it'd be fine,

4021
03:09:54,190 --> 03:09:56,920
but maybe not.
If something like this happens again,

4022
03:09:57,370 --> 03:10:00,250
you have to ask what,
what could be the change in,

4023
03:10:00,280 --> 03:10:02,890
you know,
in the human orientation to life on this

4024
03:10:02,891 --> 03:10:04,270
planet.
Like,

4025
03:10:04,330 --> 03:10:05,163
for example,
I remember the first Earth Day in 1970 

4026
03:10:07,691 --> 03:10:09,910
right?
When when this consciousness about,

4027
03:10:09,911 --> 03:10:10,750
hey,
you know what?

4028
03:10:12,250 --> 03:10:15,280
Our existence on this planet is having 
an effect on this planet.

4029
03:10:15,400 --> 03:10:16,233
Right?
And at that point you see this whole 

4030
03:10:17,231 --> 03:10:21,250
environmental consciousness emerge that 
didn't exist before that,

4031
03:10:21,430 --> 03:10:23,290
right?
Well,

4032
03:10:23,291 --> 03:10:24,124
I think maybe in the next decade or two 
we're going to see a new environmental 

4033
03:10:26,171 --> 03:10:27,004
consciousness that involves the 
recognition that this planet we live on 

4034
03:10:31,811 --> 03:10:32,644
is a very dynamic place and has been so,
and is the key to decipher in a lot of 

4035
03:10:37,151 --> 03:10:38,650
mysteries,
geological,

4036
03:10:38,710 --> 03:10:42,730
cultural,
historical and paleontological,

4037
03:10:42,731 --> 03:10:44,240
biological,
et Cetera,

4038
03:10:44,260 --> 03:10:45,093
that this has been a dominant factor in 
the evolution of basically everything 

4039
03:10:49,961 --> 03:10:50,794
that's been going on on this planet,
whether you're looking at millions of 

4040
03:10:54,040 --> 03:10:56,050
years or thousands of years,
it's just,

4041
03:10:56,110 --> 03:11:00,760
it's such a strange time to be alive 
where all this stuff is coming together.

4042
03:11:01,180 --> 03:11:06,180
All this information is being exposed 
and had an archive,

4043
03:11:08,141 --> 03:11:08,974
has been,
has been broken open and the stuff is 

4044
03:11:10,751 --> 03:11:11,584
spilling out and you don't know whether 
you've opened Pandora's box by letting 

4045
03:11:15,041 --> 03:11:16,840
it out,
but it's all logical.

4046
03:11:16,890 --> 03:11:18,730
And when this whole logical,
easy to follow,

4047
03:11:18,760 --> 03:11:20,630
it's all,
I mean it seems like when,

4048
03:11:20,680 --> 03:11:21,513
when it comes to like a step by step two
nine one zero two nine coming up one 

4049
03:11:24,611 --> 03:11:28,330
zero two nine one I fell like I'm a 
Bingo guy.

4050
03:11:28,900 --> 03:11:32,740
Now there's where he traveled about 500 
miles south out onto the Utah,

4051
03:11:33,950 --> 03:11:34,920
uh,
Canyon.

4052
03:11:34,930 --> 03:11:35,763
It's beautiful.
And what you're seeing there is 

4053
03:11:37,781 --> 03:11:42,430
basically dry cataracts.
Now that you've seen these cataracts,

4054
03:11:42,790 --> 03:11:45,190
you can begin to recognize them all over
the place.

4055
03:11:45,580 --> 03:11:46,413
Now,
this has not been acknowledged as being 

4056
03:11:49,000 --> 03:11:49,833
a cataract,
but what you actually see when you look 

4057
03:11:51,791 --> 03:11:52,624
at the modern erosion is that these 
features are being slowly eroded and 

4058
03:11:55,661 --> 03:11:57,400
eaten away by the modern erosion.

4059
03:11:57,910 --> 03:11:58,743
And it's the different erosional regime 
altogether that creates features like 

4060
03:12:01,571 --> 03:12:02,404
this.
And this is a vast scale of erosion 

4061
03:12:04,811 --> 03:12:07,180
here.
And when you travel over the south west,

4062
03:12:07,210 --> 03:12:11,860
that is the most striking thing that 
you're going to experience if you're,

4063
03:12:11,861 --> 03:12:12,760
if you're,
you know,

4064
03:12:12,761 --> 03:12:14,830
in,
in empathic with the landscape,

4065
03:12:14,831 --> 03:12:17,410
which is that there's been this enormous
amount of erosion.

4066
03:12:18,010 --> 03:12:19,870
Now,
I'm not saying that this enormous amount

4067
03:12:19,871 --> 03:12:20,704
of erosion was all created by one flood,
but I think what it is possibly saying 

4068
03:12:24,341 --> 03:12:26,740
is that when we go back over several 
million years,

4069
03:12:27,400 --> 03:12:31,720
gigantic floods on this scale aren't 
that exceptional,

4070
03:12:31,870 --> 03:12:34,360
that there's something to that from time
to time.

4071
03:12:34,840 --> 03:12:35,800
And See,
here's the thing,

4072
03:12:35,801 --> 03:12:37,960
this is completely removed from the 
glaciers.

4073
03:12:38,080 --> 03:12:38,913
Any water that would have eroded this 
landscape was not coming from the 

4074
03:12:40,931 --> 03:12:43,210
glaciers.
It had to have been coming from rainfall

4075
03:12:43,600 --> 03:12:45,550
go.
If you go to the next slide,

4076
03:12:45,580 --> 03:12:46,413
Jamie went out,
which is not a disconnected element 

4077
03:12:48,641 --> 03:12:51,920
because that because of the massive rain
out that was,

4078
03:12:51,921 --> 03:12:54,230
that resulted from the impacts on the 
ice cap.

4079
03:12:55,280 --> 03:12:57,560
What's this?
This is Vollis call Doris.

4080
03:12:57,890 --> 03:13:00,800
This is the largest volcanic Caldera and
North America.

4081
03:13:00,890 --> 03:13:03,320
Oh,
it's 11 miles across.

4082
03:13:03,950 --> 03:13:08,950
And here's what it was born out of a 
catastrophe millions of years ago,

4083
03:13:09,350 --> 03:13:10,183
right?
And then subsequent eruptions over 

4084
03:13:13,550 --> 03:13:14,960
hundreds of thousands of years of 
leftists feature.

4085
03:13:15,320 --> 03:13:18,620
But what's interesting to us,
here's what happened around 12,000

4086
03:13:18,621 --> 03:13:21,890
years ago.
The entire Caldera filled up suddenly.

4087
03:13:22,190 --> 03:13:23,023
And if you look at right about,
if you look at it as a clock at about 

4088
03:13:25,581 --> 03:13:29,450
eight o'clock you can see a breach of 
valley coming off.

4089
03:13:29,720 --> 03:13:31,760
You see that?
Jamie,

4090
03:13:31,761 --> 03:13:32,450
can you?
Yeah,

4091
03:13:32,450 --> 03:13:34,970
right there.
That was the spill over.

4092
03:13:35,090 --> 03:13:35,923
So at the same time,
now get this at the same window of time 

4093
03:13:40,040 --> 03:13:40,873
that this,
these flood events are happening up in 

4094
03:13:42,801 --> 03:13:43,634
Washington and Idaho and Montana.
This caldera suddenly fills up with 

4095
03:13:47,871 --> 03:13:52,670
water and the water spills over the rim 
and cuts a canyon hundreds of feet deep.

4096
03:13:53,240 --> 03:13:54,073
Now,
what could cause that to suddenly fill 

4097
03:13:55,851 --> 03:13:57,860
up with water and it's completely 
removed.

4098
03:13:57,861 --> 03:14:01,850
It's not receiving glacial melt water.
There's only one thing by default.

4099
03:14:01,851 --> 03:14:02,684
And that would be rainfall.
A lot of rainfall falling over days and 

4100
03:14:07,250 --> 03:14:12,250
days at a time.
So if you go to the next slide,

4101
03:14:12,530 --> 03:14:13,363
we'll see what sits down in the bottom 
of this valley is thousands of these 

4102
03:14:18,861 --> 03:14:19,694
gigantic rolled boulders and you know 
that their water transport it because 

4103
03:14:23,331 --> 03:14:25,550
they're round their role.
That's what water does.

4104
03:14:25,551 --> 03:14:28,040
It rolls these things.
Now this is in New Mexico.

4105
03:14:28,340 --> 03:14:31,580
See?
So this is related to the spillway.

4106
03:14:31,581 --> 03:14:32,414
The overflow of all called era,
which has been dated to that same 

4107
03:14:35,481 --> 03:14:38,360
interval when the floods were happening 
up north,

4108
03:14:38,450 --> 03:14:41,600
the same interval that now the comment 
is dating too.

4109
03:14:41,990 --> 03:14:44,510
Is this coincidence or are the two 
related?

4110
03:14:44,540 --> 03:14:45,373
I would say it would be very premature 
to dismiss it and say that they're not 

4111
03:14:48,381 --> 03:14:50,750
relating to that because as graeme just 
said,

4112
03:14:50,900 --> 03:14:53,660
one of the once at one of the 
consequences of an impact,

4113
03:14:53,661 --> 03:14:55,820
whether it's into the ocean or the ice 
sheet,

4114
03:14:56,090 --> 03:15:01,090
is you're going to have extreme amounts 
of water vapor injected catastrophic Lee

4115
03:15:01,310 --> 03:15:02,143
into the atmosphere,
which is then going to rain out in 

4116
03:15:05,001 --> 03:15:09,770
incredible torrential downpours that 
might last for days at a time,

4117
03:15:10,130 --> 03:15:10,963
and we'll along with that,
water vapor is a tremendous amount of 

4118
03:15:13,101 --> 03:15:13,934
particulate mass and it's that right out
that I would say close the erosion on 

4119
03:15:17,271 --> 03:15:19,820
the Sphinx and tells us that the Sphinx 
is 12,000

4120
03:15:19,821 --> 03:15:23,840
years old,
2005 you guys are freaking me out.

4121
03:15:25,040 --> 03:15:28,880
This is amazing.
This is the most convincing argument yet

4122
03:15:29,410 --> 03:15:33,980
that you guys have ever made for this 
because it's all,

4123
03:15:33,981 --> 03:15:35,780
it's all been convincing.
This is a,

4124
03:15:35,781 --> 03:15:39,980
this is more compelling and then all the
pieces with the go home together.

4125
03:15:41,120 --> 03:15:42,650
Next slide,
Jamie,

4126
03:15:42,740 --> 03:15:43,573
which would be thousand and 32 which is 
to me a beautiful example of scale and 

4127
03:15:47,931 --> 03:15:49,150
variance.
Oh Wow.

4128
03:15:49,410 --> 03:15:49,980
Here we have the

4129
03:15:49,980 --> 03:15:52,890
modern snake river flowing into modern 
channel,

4130
03:15:53,610 --> 03:15:54,443
and then we have the ancient flood 
channel and which you can see there the 

4131
03:15:58,321 --> 03:16:02,250
average annual discharge of the snake,
56,900

4132
03:16:02,251 --> 03:16:05,520
cubic feet,
but the estimated flood that created the

4133
03:16:05,521 --> 03:16:06,354
big channel is 40 million cubic feet.
And now this flood actually was coming 

4134
03:16:11,581 --> 03:16:13,710
up,
get this out of Utah.

4135
03:16:14,250 --> 03:16:17,670
It was coming up.
It was part of the giant Lake Bonneville

4136
03:16:17,760 --> 03:16:21,810
of which the Great Salt Lake is,
but a diminutive remnant.

4137
03:16:21,870 --> 03:16:25,290
So the Bonneville Salt Flats,
a Bonneville salt flats where the bottom

4138
03:16:25,291 --> 03:16:30,291
of this gigantic lake that that filled 
the basins of north eastern Utah,

4139
03:16:31,080 --> 03:16:31,913
and at the end of the last ice age,
it's suddenly filled up very rapidly in 

4140
03:16:35,801 --> 03:16:40,190
spilled over a mountain pass to the 
north and then flooded the south.

4141
03:16:40,200 --> 03:16:44,400
The the Snake River Plain of southern 
Idaho in anybody can see the snake river

4142
03:16:44,401 --> 03:16:45,234
plain.
If you go to google earth or any 

4143
03:16:46,141 --> 03:16:51,141
topographic map and it cut channels like
this that ultimately led to the Columbia

4144
03:16:51,211 --> 03:16:52,044
river,
but interestingly the dating of this 

4145
03:16:54,331 --> 03:16:56,430
puts it again right in that window.

4146
03:16:56,820 --> 03:17:00,000
Um,
so that window of 12,000,

4147
03:17:00,001 --> 03:17:03,690
800 to 11,600
years ago when everything changes,

4148
03:17:04,110 --> 03:17:04,943
everything changes.
And so what I'm showing you is just a 

4149
03:17:06,691 --> 03:17:07,524
little bit selecting random almost dots 
to show you that no matter where you 

4150
03:17:11,941 --> 03:17:14,280
look,
you're going to see evidence of these,

4151
03:17:14,310 --> 03:17:16,800
of these events imprinted into the 
landscape.

4152
03:17:17,220 --> 03:17:18,870
Um,
yeah,

4153
03:17:18,871 --> 03:17:23,871
go to the next slide.
1033 and if you go down and you stand on

4154
03:17:23,971 --> 03:17:24,804
that flood plain down there,
you'll see the kind of stuff that got 

4155
03:17:28,261 --> 03:17:29,094
left behind.
This is the sediment load being carried 

4156
03:17:32,641 --> 03:17:33,870
into flood.
Wow.

4157
03:17:34,950 --> 03:17:35,783
So you got what kind of powerful 
currents are necessary to transport and 

4158
03:17:39,331 --> 03:17:42,420
I'm standing in the canyon,
it was cut by the flood.

4159
03:17:42,600 --> 03:17:43,433
Those walls are 400 feet high.
So what we would think of as being like 

4160
03:17:46,321 --> 03:17:49,710
little pebbles at the bottom of a stream
and it gets moved around.

4161
03:17:49,760 --> 03:17:50,593
Yes.
Grand Scans is like sand grains on the 

4162
03:17:53,071 --> 03:17:57,510
bottom of a modern little creek or river
set that humongous boulders.

4163
03:17:57,600 --> 03:17:58,433
Yes.
And this is what a geologist or 

4164
03:18:00,001 --> 03:18:00,834
geomorphologists would call it,
the bed load to stuff being swept along 

4165
03:18:03,620 --> 03:18:06,570
in,
in the floodwaters reenrolled and tumble

4166
03:18:06,600 --> 03:18:10,890
and geologists recognize this,
but they think it took mainstream.

4167
03:18:10,891 --> 03:18:14,220
Geologists think it took a long no,
I mean the few geological,

4168
03:18:14,400 --> 03:18:15,233
uh,
papers had been written on this admit 

4169
03:18:16,521 --> 03:18:18,960
that it was a one big catastrophic 
flood.

4170
03:18:19,200 --> 03:18:20,033
Wow.
And what is their explanation for that 

4171
03:18:21,481 --> 03:18:22,860
catastrophic flood?
Well,

4172
03:18:22,861 --> 03:18:26,070
that Somehow Lake Bonneville rose up 
and,

4173
03:18:26,130 --> 03:18:27,240
and Z,
right.

4174
03:18:27,241 --> 03:18:30,060
Breached him up pass and it's northern 
rim.

4175
03:18:30,630 --> 03:18:32,700
But you know,
is that possible in any way?

4176
03:18:33,390 --> 03:18:34,223
Well,
yeah,

4177
03:18:34,230 --> 03:18:36,780
if you have enough rainfall prolonged 
over a period of time,

4178
03:18:36,781 --> 03:18:38,590
days or weeks,
um,

4179
03:18:39,000 --> 03:18:42,030
that the whole body of water could have 
raised by 300 feet roughly.

4180
03:18:42,060 --> 03:18:42,751
And then at that,
you,

4181
03:18:42,751 --> 03:18:44,950
again,
you would need something like the commit

4182
03:18:44,951 --> 03:18:46,860
impact to provide you with a source for 
that.

4183
03:18:47,220 --> 03:18:48,053
Right.
Because otherwise there's no other 

4184
03:18:48,631 --> 03:18:49,464
explanation for that kind of that kind 
of rainfall in it's known from the 

4185
03:18:51,871 --> 03:18:52,704
modeling of Oceanic impacts that yes,
there would be unbelievable rainout in 

4186
03:18:57,301 --> 03:19:01,430
the aftermath of an oceanic impact.
And clearly the same thing would,

4187
03:19:01,470 --> 03:19:04,050
would follow in the wake of a,
of an ice impact.

4188
03:19:04,080 --> 03:19:06,990
What oceanic impacts that we have on 
record only a few of them.

4189
03:19:07,020 --> 03:19:09,720
Um,
there's one up by Sweden,

4190
03:19:10,350 --> 03:19:13,170
we were discussing also the possible 
Indian Ocean impact,

4191
03:19:13,200 --> 03:19:16,200
possibly one in the Indian Ocean 5,000
years ago,

4192
03:19:16,201 --> 03:19:17,034
which,
which creates tsunamis on both sides of 

4193
03:19:19,141 --> 03:19:23,280
the Indian Ocean dated to about massive,
massive tsunami disposit deposits.

4194
03:19:24,020 --> 03:19:25,870
Um,
and then again,

4195
03:19:26,180 --> 03:19:27,013
this whole argument of the younger dryas
cataclysm between twelve thousand eight 

4196
03:19:31,440 --> 03:19:32,273
hundred and eleven thousand six hundred 
years ago.

4197
03:19:32,550 --> 03:19:37,260
The strongest case is the focus of the 
science has been on 12,800

4198
03:19:37,261 --> 03:19:38,094
years ago,
but there's a lot of interest in the 

4199
03:19:39,061 --> 03:19:41,040
11,600
years ago as well.

4200
03:19:41,041 --> 03:19:41,874
And the strongest suggestion of what 
caused that that sudden rise in 

4201
03:19:46,561 --> 03:19:48,840
temperatures accompanied by meltwater 
pulse.

4202
03:19:49,170 --> 03:19:54,170
One B was a second encounter with more 
fragments of the debris of the comment.

4203
03:19:54,950 --> 03:19:55,783
This time,
the impact of not being on the North 

4204
03:19:57,990 --> 03:20:00,090
American ice cap,
but in a major ocean,

4205
03:20:00,120 --> 03:20:02,370
probably the Pacific,
and that,

4206
03:20:02,400 --> 03:20:03,233
that then puts a huge plume of water 
vapor into the upper atmosphere and 

4207
03:20:06,611 --> 03:20:07,444
shrouds the earth and creates the 
greenhouse effect that accounts for the 

4208
03:20:10,891 --> 03:20:14,400
radical rise in temperature that 
occurred 11,600

4209
03:20:14,401 --> 03:20:17,040
years ago.
More science needs to be done on that.

4210
03:20:17,041 --> 03:20:17,874
It's another reason why I want to see 
the comment research group funded 

4211
03:20:19,651 --> 03:20:21,840
because this is,
this is important work.

4212
03:20:22,640 --> 03:20:24,440
Goddamn is an awesome podcast.

4213
03:20:25,270 --> 03:20:27,950
This might be my all time favorite.
Whew.

4214
03:20:28,210 --> 03:20:30,700
Okay.
Half a dozen more.

4215
03:20:30,820 --> 03:20:31,750
Yeah,
for sure.

4216
03:20:31,751 --> 03:20:32,680
Let's roll.
Okay.

4217
03:20:32,770 --> 03:20:33,603
1039 and this is here now.
You'll be able to see actually a person 

4218
03:20:39,010 --> 03:20:39,843
in the,
in the field of view next to one at a 

4219
03:20:41,351 --> 03:20:43,430
giant current ripple.
And uh,

4220
03:20:45,650 --> 03:20:47,900
there's a giant that's a giant current 
ripple field.

4221
03:20:47,901 --> 03:20:50,300
We did see this one gram.
This is the west bar.

4222
03:20:50,710 --> 03:20:51,650
Um,
all right,

4223
03:20:51,651 --> 03:20:52,510
cool.
Yes.

4224
03:20:52,580 --> 03:20:56,810
If you go back one slide,
we can see an aerial photo.

4225
03:20:56,811 --> 03:21:00,680
I took years ago of West bar.
It's three miles long.

4226
03:21:01,530 --> 03:21:02,300
Okay,

4227
03:21:02,300 --> 03:21:03,410
there it is.
Whoa.

4228
03:21:03,890 --> 03:21:04,723
And there's an airport down.
The lighter colored buff stuff is a 

4229
03:21:07,431 --> 03:21:09,770
landing strip and the the,
the,

4230
03:21:09,820 --> 03:21:10,880
the,
the uh,

4231
03:21:11,000 --> 03:21:13,340
airport building,
there is three stories tall.

4232
03:21:13,550 --> 03:21:14,383
So this whole feature is um,
three miles long and the ripples here 

4233
03:21:18,321 --> 03:21:21,950
are on the same scale as the canvas 
prairie ripples that we just looked at.

4234
03:21:22,280 --> 03:21:24,500
Of course,
this is in central Washington,

4235
03:21:24,501 --> 03:21:27,250
the other one was in Montana.
So again,

4236
03:21:27,251 --> 03:21:28,084
you,
as we begin to place these event nodes 

4237
03:21:30,710 --> 03:21:31,543
around on the map,
we can begin to see the outlines of a 

4238
03:21:34,011 --> 03:21:34,844
really,
really huge event and all of this is 

4239
03:21:37,011 --> 03:21:39,590
going on at the same time.
You've got to understand the data to the

4240
03:21:39,591 --> 03:21:41,720
same time.
All this is dated to the,

4241
03:21:41,721 --> 03:21:46,100
the the same time that you think the 
impact took place and all over

4242
03:21:46,100 --> 03:21:46,933
that coast.
The only dates that we have that are 

4243
03:21:49,221 --> 03:21:50,054
hard dates are a volcanic ash,
primarily from Mount Saint Helens that 

4244
03:21:53,671 --> 03:21:55,610
date at 13,000
years.

4245
03:21:56,000 --> 03:21:56,833
But they use that as a baseline and then
assume that there was multiple floods 

4246
03:22:01,251 --> 03:22:04,490
and each flood was separated by 50 to a 
hundred years,

4247
03:22:04,790 --> 03:22:05,623
and what they've done is they've gone 
from Brett's his original model of a 

4248
03:22:08,451 --> 03:22:13,400
single flood into a dozen floods into 40
floods and now up to 80 or 90 floods,

4249
03:22:13,970 --> 03:22:17,240
which I disagree with.
But on the other hand there were,

4250
03:22:17,300 --> 03:22:18,133
see,
I think you have to understand this in 

4251
03:22:19,761 --> 03:22:20,594
two phases because the impact phase is 
going to melt a whole lot of ice all of 

4252
03:22:25,221 --> 03:22:27,410
a sudden,
but it's not going to melt all of it.

4253
03:22:27,710 --> 03:22:32,180
It's going to leave a huge amount of 
residual ice in the aftermath.

4254
03:22:32,660 --> 03:22:36,500
Now what we see is that particularly 
after the 11,600

4255
03:22:36,590 --> 03:22:38,780
year ago event,
at that point,

4256
03:22:38,781 --> 03:22:42,030
the whole planet comes right out of the 
ice age inexplicably.

4257
03:22:42,030 --> 03:22:42,863
That's the end.
That's the end of the IC at the 

4258
03:22:44,390 --> 03:22:46,580
beginning of the Holocene.
It's over and,

4259
03:22:46,690 --> 03:22:51,440
and basically what we're seeing there is
that there's a great deal of,

4260
03:22:51,670 --> 03:22:52,503
of heat.
Suddenly that's brought the planet out 

4261
03:22:54,021 --> 03:22:56,990
of the IC.
It does not convert revert back into the

4262
03:22:56,991 --> 03:23:00,560
ice age like I did at the 12,900
event.

4263
03:23:01,070 --> 03:23:01,903
See.
So what we then have is that in the 

4264
03:23:03,741 --> 03:23:04,574
aftermath of this event,
the whole climate of the earth has been 

4265
03:23:08,361 --> 03:23:09,194
completely altered.
The whole balance of nature has been 

4266
03:23:11,781 --> 03:23:16,100
completely altered from before these 
events to after these events.

4267
03:23:16,610 --> 03:23:17,443
But what you have now is a lot of 
residual ice that takes about two or 

4268
03:23:20,331 --> 03:23:23,480
3000 years to melt away.
So say levels continue to rise.

4269
03:23:23,510 --> 03:23:24,343
Sea level of continual work to rise and 
the melting of this ice produces some 

4270
03:23:27,771 --> 03:23:28,604
pretty big floods,
but not on the scale of what we're 

4271
03:23:31,791 --> 03:23:32,540
looking at here.

4272
03:23:32,540 --> 03:23:37,190
And I think it's my personal opinion 
that there's a confusion between the two

4273
03:23:37,191 --> 03:23:39,240
different flood regimes.
And,

4274
03:23:39,241 --> 03:23:42,950
and I'm going to document all,
I'm writing all this up in detail as a,

4275
03:23:42,951 --> 03:23:45,980
as a,
like as a thesis to explain,

4276
03:23:46,150 --> 03:23:48,020
um,
my interpretation of,

4277
03:23:48,021 --> 03:23:51,890
of the phenomena over 20 years.
But let's go to,

4278
03:23:51,891 --> 03:23:53,930
um,
that would be so important.

4279
03:23:53,960 --> 03:23:58,100
I would love to see people really go 
over this with a fine tooth comb because

4280
03:23:58,101 --> 03:24:00,080
it's so compelling.
She saw amazing,

4281
03:24:00,081 --> 03:24:02,690
like just this image itself.
It's just wow,

4282
03:24:02,900 --> 03:24:03,733
what would it,
what kind of power and force would it 

4283
03:24:06,651 --> 03:24:07,484
take to create those rebels,
those 50 foot high ripples all over the 

4284
03:24:09,951 --> 03:24:12,260
place.
Miles and miles and miles of them.

4285
03:24:12,470 --> 03:24:13,051
Yeah.
And,

4286
03:24:13,051 --> 03:24:13,884
and she nothing,
since that event has really affected 

4287
03:24:16,251 --> 03:24:17,084
them,
they're still sitting here as these 

4288
03:24:17,541 --> 03:24:20,810
gigantic monstrous fossil features in 
the landscape.

4289
03:24:20,990 --> 03:24:22,850
Now when they do core samples on that 
stuff,

4290
03:24:22,851 --> 03:24:25,040
what do they find out?
Like as far as the dating of it,

4291
03:24:25,220 --> 03:24:27,080
like if they get to the bottom and one 
of those ripples,

4292
03:24:27,220 --> 03:24:28,640
well you,
you've got to find,

4293
03:24:28,970 --> 03:24:32,390
you've got to be able to find organic 
material in there.

4294
03:24:32,660 --> 03:24:34,640
And to the extent that there's organic 
material,

4295
03:24:34,700 --> 03:24:37,010
it basically all dates from the end of 
the ice age.

4296
03:24:37,011 --> 03:24:37,844
The problem is,
is when you have a flood like this 

4297
03:24:39,171 --> 03:24:42,560
coming through,
it's sweeping up everything in its path,

4298
03:24:42,561 --> 03:24:43,980
including forests

4299
03:24:43,980 --> 03:24:44,813
and animals.
So if you've got a bone in there or a 

4300
03:24:46,501 --> 03:24:50,640
piece of wood deck doesn't necessarily 
mean when the flood happened.

4301
03:24:51,140 --> 03:24:53,930
It's not a nice layer of sets,
layers of sediment.

4302
03:24:53,931 --> 03:24:56,630
It's a jumbled mess.
Chaotic,

4303
03:24:56,720 --> 03:24:59,660
chaotic mass.
It's not like you could just go right

4304
03:24:59,700 --> 03:25:00,533
dig into the side of that hill at that 
same level and find something that's 

4305
03:25:03,151 --> 03:25:06,150
organic and absolutely dated it to that 
cause that's all stone,

4306
03:25:06,340 --> 03:25:06,990
right?
Right.

4307
03:25:06,990 --> 03:25:07,830
It's Boulder's.
It's,

4308
03:25:07,840 --> 03:25:08,673
yeah.
If you saw a cross section of one of 

4309
03:25:09,601 --> 03:25:10,920
those ripples,
it's,

4310
03:25:10,950 --> 03:25:11,783
it's just a jumbled,
chaotic mess of everything from the 

4311
03:25:13,950 --> 03:25:14,783
finest sand and silt up to boulders,
the size of cars and even houses and 

4312
03:25:19,410 --> 03:25:20,400
stuff.
Just yeah.

4313
03:25:20,760 --> 03:25:24,660
That's so crazy.
Go to 10 41 and we'll see an interesting

4314
03:25:24,690 --> 03:25:26,960
uh,
artist's rendition by um,

4315
03:25:27,900 --> 03:25:31,050
Edward Rio who did all the illustrations
for the jewels,

4316
03:25:31,070 --> 03:25:34,330
original Jules Verne books and he did a 
version for an,

4317
03:25:34,340 --> 03:25:37,740
a straw straw geology text.
Um,

4318
03:25:38,850 --> 03:25:40,800
what was the guy's name is skipping me 
right now,

4319
03:25:40,801 --> 03:25:41,634
but I thought it was an interesting 
image because it basically shows an 

4320
03:25:44,701 --> 03:25:47,010
event on the scale of what we're talking
about.

4321
03:25:48,060 --> 03:25:48,893
And what's interesting here is you see 
that the torrents are carrying icebergs 

4322
03:25:51,960 --> 03:25:54,060
and in this one iceberg and the 
foreground,

4323
03:25:54,600 --> 03:25:56,010
I call it grams rock.

4324
03:25:56,010 --> 03:25:57,450
From now on,
it's going to be,

4325
03:25:57,510 --> 03:26:02,430
I have officially turned named Greg is 
carrying a gigantic grant and I are,

4326
03:26:02,540 --> 03:26:03,373
we're talking about it now.
It's great because I went and climbed 

4327
03:26:06,121 --> 03:26:09,320
that no longer there when acci erratic 
gray.

4328
03:26:09,390 --> 03:26:10,580
Erratic.
Oh,

4329
03:26:10,670 --> 03:26:11,940
I'm on it driving.
Thank you.

4330
03:26:12,180 --> 03:26:14,850
Okay,
so we've got the grant already coming up

4331
03:26:14,851 --> 03:26:17,370
in about three images.
So let's go to the next one,

4332
03:26:17,371 --> 03:26:18,204
10 42 and this is basically another key 
piece of evidence is strewn for 

4333
03:26:23,191 --> 03:26:26,700
thousands of square miles throughout the
path of the flood.

4334
03:26:26,880 --> 03:26:31,600
You have these gigantic boulders and 
these are being carried aboard iceberg.

4335
03:26:31,650 --> 03:26:32,483
So let me,
let me describe what we're looking at 

4336
03:26:33,391 --> 03:26:35,550
right now because this is a person.
Is that you there?

4337
03:26:35,660 --> 03:26:36,690
Uh,
I took the picture.

4338
03:26:36,691 --> 03:26:39,410
So it's two of my fellow travelers.
Okay.

4339
03:26:39,420 --> 03:26:42,330
Normal sized people and you know,
whatever.

4340
03:26:42,331 --> 03:26:46,380
Six feet tall and,
and bounce them on top of each other.

4341
03:26:46,560 --> 03:26:47,393
1218.
You're looking at probably the least 35 

4342
03:26:51,541 --> 03:26:52,470
40 feet tall,
right?

4343
03:26:52,471 --> 03:26:53,304
Yeah,
yeah.

4344
03:26:53,580 --> 03:26:55,200
And Yeah,
and wider.

4345
03:26:55,380 --> 03:26:56,850
Wider than it is tall.
Oh yeah.

4346
03:26:56,851 --> 03:26:58,230
It's 60 feet wide.
Does,

4347
03:26:58,231 --> 03:27:00,690
that's insane.
And that was carried by water.

4348
03:27:00,720 --> 03:27:04,110
It was carried.
It was carried on icebergs in the water.

4349
03:27:04,380 --> 03:27:05,213
Oh my God.

4350
03:27:06,120 --> 03:27:07,840
This flood is not just water.
It's,

4351
03:27:07,841 --> 03:27:08,140
it's,
it's,

4352
03:27:08,140 --> 03:27:10,240
it's huge.
Thousands of icebergs.

4353
03:27:10,241 --> 03:27:15,241
It's far strips up by their moods.
It's a jumbling mass of powerful erosive

4354
03:27:15,431 --> 03:27:16,780
flow.
Amazing.

4355
03:27:16,990 --> 03:27:19,360
Thousands of megafauna are done down.
In fact,

4356
03:27:19,361 --> 03:27:23,920
a lot of the,
there've been a lot of a mammoth remains

4357
03:27:23,950 --> 03:27:27,580
found in missoula flood sediments,
particularly in the Willamette valley.

4358
03:27:28,480 --> 03:27:30,760
Okay.
Let's go to the next image.

4359
03:27:31,630 --> 03:27:32,500
There we go.
This is,

4360
03:27:32,501 --> 03:27:34,840
I like out in the middle of the prayer.
You again,

4361
03:27:34,841 --> 03:27:36,790
you've got thousands of these things.
I'll tell you what.

4362
03:27:36,791 --> 03:27:38,200
I'm a chicken.
I wouldn't stand right there.

4363
03:27:38,470 --> 03:27:40,210
I think that thing's gonna roll on top 
of you.

4364
03:27:40,900 --> 03:27:42,740
That would be a wrap son.
Yeah.

4365
03:27:43,330 --> 03:27:44,163
This is known as yeager raw.
That thing's huge and is that you want 

4366
03:27:47,621 --> 03:27:48,401
to need there?
No,

4367
03:27:48,401 --> 03:27:50,440
that's one of my tribe.
I took the picture and tell them.

4368
03:27:50,441 --> 03:27:51,400
Stand there.
Yeah.

4369
03:27:51,401 --> 03:27:52,234
I said stand here and then I had the 
other guys go around the back rock push 

4370
03:27:55,960 --> 03:27:56,793
on it.
This thing has kind of hanging off the 

4371
03:27:59,020 --> 03:28:02,650
side of that hill the way some of those 
Hollywood hills houses are the ones that

4372
03:28:02,651 --> 03:28:06,460
are on stilts that that rounded massive 
stuff that it's sitting in.

4373
03:28:06,460 --> 03:28:10,420
It's called the Berg mound,
and you see these icebergs are not clean

4374
03:28:10,421 --> 03:28:11,260
ice,
they're dirty,

4375
03:28:11,261 --> 03:28:15,190
they're filled with gravel and debris.
So when a Berg Berg,

4376
03:28:15,220 --> 03:28:18,250
it's being carried into flood and the 
flood waters subside,

4377
03:28:18,251 --> 03:28:21,820
the burgs get stranded in the land,
they then melt.

4378
03:28:22,120 --> 03:28:24,610
And if there's no boulder,
there's just a mound.

4379
03:28:24,611 --> 03:28:27,280
If there's no gigantic boulder,
there's just a mound.

4380
03:28:27,640 --> 03:28:31,870
But if there is a gigantic boulder being
carried aboard the iceberg,

4381
03:28:32,020 --> 03:28:34,150
it will be sitting in a Burg mound like 
you see.

4382
03:28:34,151 --> 03:28:35,170
Right.
That's amazing.

4383
03:28:35,171 --> 03:28:36,004
So that white line that we see,
it was where the iceberg was when it 

4384
03:28:38,651 --> 03:28:40,930
deposited that thing,
then it just melted from there.

4385
03:28:40,990 --> 03:28:41,823
No,
that's actually a bedding plane between 

4386
03:28:43,661 --> 03:28:46,270
two different kinds of basalt.
Oh,

4387
03:28:46,300 --> 03:28:47,133
okay.
So the mound itself below it is what 

4388
03:28:49,211 --> 03:28:52,630
you're saying is the Berg mound,
that's the Berg mound and the bolder,

4389
03:28:52,631 --> 03:28:56,140
the big boulder was the cargo sitting on
top of the iceberg.

4390
03:28:56,200 --> 03:28:57,160
Ah,
okay.

4391
03:28:57,161 --> 03:28:57,994
So the [inaudible] is not just water,
it's water with a bunch of dirt and all 

4392
03:29:00,851 --> 03:29:03,220
kinds of other shit in it as well.
And so when it melts,

4393
03:29:03,221 --> 03:29:05,980
that's what it leaves behind.
But at least I see.

4394
03:29:06,160 --> 03:29:08,110
That's amazing.
Okay.

4395
03:29:08,140 --> 03:29:10,460
In the next image we have the hancock 
around.

4396
03:29:11,140 --> 03:29:13,480
Is that you up there?
Well that's me on top of that.

4397
03:29:16,900 --> 03:29:17,920
Once you're breaking the law.

4398
03:29:18,080 --> 03:29:19,430
Yeah,
I was.

4399
03:29:19,450 --> 03:29:21,200
I,
I do that from time to time,

4400
03:29:21,201 --> 03:29:22,100
but it,
but it,

4401
03:29:22,130 --> 03:29:22,740
it's,
it,

4402
03:29:22,740 --> 03:29:23,573
it's an amazing experience to stand 
there and to think what transported 

4403
03:29:26,211 --> 03:29:26,661
this?
Well,

4404
03:29:26,661 --> 03:29:27,494
we know it was transported in an iceberg
and it was dumped there on the side of 

4405
03:29:29,841 --> 03:29:30,674
that valley.
And it's just the thought of thousands 

4406
03:29:32,601 --> 03:29:36,440
of these things plowing along at 60 or 
70 miles an hour,

4407
03:29:36,441 --> 03:29:40,010
carried on a gigantic flood.
How do we have anything left?

4408
03:29:40,011 --> 03:29:41,330
You know,
no wonder.

4409
03:29:41,510 --> 03:29:43,100
No wonder we forgotten our past.

4410
03:29:43,360 --> 03:29:44,530
And here's the thing.
I mean,

4411
03:29:44,590 --> 03:29:45,423
what we're doing here is we're looking 
where these flood events are preserved 

4412
03:29:48,461 --> 03:29:49,294
the most spectacularly in.
The reason is is because you had a very 

4413
03:29:52,061 --> 03:29:55,690
steep gradient from the ice sheet 
elevation to the Pacific Ocean.

4414
03:29:56,200 --> 03:29:59,170
But like Graham and I,
when we traveled across,

4415
03:29:59,290 --> 03:30:00,123
we traveled across the continental 
divide and traveled from the rocky 

4416
03:30:03,491 --> 03:30:04,324
mountains to the twin cities,
which is on the Mississippi River and 

4417
03:30:06,850 --> 03:30:07,683
all the way across,
we were caught crossing huge meltwater 

4418
03:30:10,151 --> 03:30:12,970
Cooley's.
We crossed the Missouri River valley,

4419
03:30:12,971 --> 03:30:16,540
which is an under fifth stream,
just very similar to the snake where the

4420
03:30:16,541 --> 03:30:17,374
modern Missouri is just a little ribbon 
of river occupying this massive 

4421
03:30:21,160 --> 03:30:25,000
meltwater channel of which there are 
hundreds across the plains.

4422
03:30:25,360 --> 03:30:26,193
And then when we got to Minneapolis,
we went up and we visited some of the 

4423
03:30:28,781 --> 03:30:29,614
largest

4424
03:30:30,200 --> 03:30:32,660
amazing potholes,
which again,

4425
03:30:32,661 --> 03:30:34,820
you're looking on the scale of giants.
This is,

4426
03:30:34,821 --> 03:30:38,270
this is beyond imagination.
What you look at and the,

4427
03:30:38,280 --> 03:30:40,160
and the only the flood

4428
03:30:40,160 --> 03:30:44,840
explanation makes sense of it.
Go to go to one zero five four Jamie,

4429
03:30:47,090 --> 03:30:48,890
and you'll see,
oh,

4430
03:30:48,980 --> 03:30:51,830
there we go.
I'm down inside the pot hole.

4431
03:30:51,831 --> 03:30:53,870
One of the potholes looking up at 
Graham.

4432
03:30:53,900 --> 03:30:57,860
So that's a pothole carved into stone by
whirlpool.

4433
03:30:58,120 --> 03:31:01,070
Yeah.
Picking up rocks and amend that.

4434
03:31:01,071 --> 03:31:03,140
Rob said,
the erosive agent that's cutting out the

4435
03:31:03,160 --> 03:31:03,993
pothole,
just think like a massive hydraulic 

4436
03:31:07,641 --> 03:31:08,990
drill.
Wow.

4437
03:31:09,050 --> 03:31:10,150
Just picking up,
you know,

4438
03:31:10,630 --> 03:31:11,463
course rock and just drilling.
Literally drilling holds 50 60 80 feet 

4439
03:31:16,611 --> 03:31:17,361
deep.
Again,

4440
03:31:17,361 --> 03:31:18,680
for the Rock,
go to the Youtube,

4441
03:31:18,890 --> 03:31:20,270
please.
If you're listening to this,

4442
03:31:20,540 --> 03:31:23,420
just go.
Just so you got to fast forward to this.

4443
03:31:23,421 --> 03:31:25,730
This is insane.
Image is insane.

4444
03:31:26,000 --> 03:31:28,550
Just thinking of watching rock spin 
around,

4445
03:31:29,670 --> 03:31:30,503
drilling into the ground,
and you're talking about over a short 

4446
03:31:31,521 --> 03:31:32,620
period of time.
Yeah,

4447
03:31:33,620 --> 03:31:34,360
probably.
You know,

4448
03:31:34,360 --> 03:31:36,590
I'm guessing you know these giant 
meltwater floods.

4449
03:31:36,650 --> 03:31:38,360
This is right along the Saint Croix 
River,

4450
03:31:38,361 --> 03:31:41,210
which forms the border between Minnesota
and Wisconsin.

4451
03:31:42,530 --> 03:31:46,460
It was probably of several weeks 
duration to its peak at its peak,

4452
03:31:46,820 --> 03:31:47,653
and so the drilling of the bedrock 
probably was accomplished within that 

4453
03:31:51,531 --> 03:31:52,364
time span.
What I wouldn't give to know what that 

4454
03:31:55,251 --> 03:31:56,084
was like just to see it,
but you would've had to be in an orbit 

4455
03:31:59,421 --> 03:32:01,190
to survive it,
right?

4456
03:32:01,191 --> 03:32:03,240
Yeah.
Even if you're flying over in a plane pr

4457
03:32:03,260 --> 03:32:05,180
probably that just the atmosphere 
change.

4458
03:32:05,210 --> 03:32:09,200
Liz on top of these flood sediments 
from,

4459
03:32:09,320 --> 03:32:12,350
I've documented it from Ohio to 
Washington state.

4460
03:32:12,380 --> 03:32:13,213
There are thick layers of loss.
Now euless is this strange topsoil that 

4461
03:32:18,621 --> 03:32:22,580
came down and it's,
they've been arguing for generations.

4462
03:32:22,581 --> 03:32:23,414
Is it wind deposited or water deposited?
But the curious thing is it seems to be 

4463
03:32:27,471 --> 03:32:32,471
both wind and water deposited,
but then I think the obvious explanation

4464
03:32:32,721 --> 03:32:35,420
for it is,
is that when you see the,

4465
03:32:35,650 --> 03:32:38,540
the like the,
the top layers of the flood sediments,

4466
03:32:38,541 --> 03:32:40,880
particularly in the back flood regions 
where the,

4467
03:32:40,910 --> 03:32:43,670
where the water was calm or rather than 
so torrential,

4468
03:32:44,120 --> 03:32:46,490
you'll see these layers,
these beautiful,

4469
03:32:46,491 --> 03:32:47,720
it's because they're called writhe 
mites.

4470
03:32:47,720 --> 03:32:48,553
They're very rhythmical.
On top of that is a layer of this lust 

4471
03:32:52,221 --> 03:32:54,950
topsoil with this vertical structure.
Right.

4472
03:32:55,520 --> 03:32:57,040
Well,
the to me,

4473
03:32:57,090 --> 03:32:59,480
and again without getting into the 
technical background,

4474
03:32:59,481 --> 03:33:00,314
I think the logical explanation and most
likely explanation is that at the tail 

4475
03:33:03,921 --> 03:33:05,810
end of the,
the final flood flows,

4476
03:33:05,811 --> 03:33:09,080
what you're seeing is,
is rainfall of mud.

4477
03:33:09,380 --> 03:33:12,410
And this rainfall of mud came down in a,
in a fiction,

4478
03:33:12,411 --> 03:33:16,100
many ancient traditions speak of black 
but humanist rain,

4479
03:33:16,101 --> 03:33:19,040
mud falling from the sky,
darkness,

4480
03:33:19,041 --> 03:33:21,860
a time of darkness.
It's all described in the myth.

4481
03:33:21,861 --> 03:33:24,440
Myths are the memory banks of,
of humanity.

4482
03:33:24,441 --> 03:33:26,930
We should not call the myths,
we should call them memories.

4483
03:33:26,990 --> 03:33:28,040
Yeah,
exactly.

4484
03:33:28,490 --> 03:33:29,630
And,
and again,

4485
03:33:29,631 --> 03:33:30,464
this,
this muddy rainfall perfectly fits the 

4486
03:33:32,421 --> 03:33:35,030
whole narrative.
And yet with the mythology,

4487
03:33:35,031 --> 03:33:35,864
it,
it's,

4488
03:33:36,380 --> 03:33:37,920
it's right there.
When we think of these,

4489
03:33:38,110 --> 03:33:39,540
the,
the idea of these tsunamis,

4490
03:33:39,541 --> 03:33:40,374
we think of water that you can see more,
most likely dealing with the entire air 

4491
03:33:43,531 --> 03:33:44,364
around you,
filled with torrential downpour and 

4492
03:33:46,321 --> 03:33:49,380
solid matter and everything's flying to 
the air.

4493
03:33:50,370 --> 03:33:52,990
Incredible wins.
Incredible wins.

4494
03:33:53,010 --> 03:33:53,843
Yes.
So it's both wind and water and just 

4495
03:33:55,741 --> 03:33:58,530
full on chaos,
super hurricanes.

4496
03:33:58,560 --> 03:34:03,560
It's nature gone chaotic and crazy on 
ultimate steroids.

4497
03:34:04,440 --> 03:34:05,910
This is what it is.
Wild.

4498
03:34:06,090 --> 03:34:06,923
And it's real.
That's the thing that didn't happening 

4499
03:34:08,191 --> 03:34:09,960
while people were alive.
Oh yeah.

4500
03:34:09,961 --> 03:34:11,130
It happened a while.
People were alive.

4501
03:34:11,770 --> 03:34:13,900
Absolutely.
Some dinosaur thing.

4502
03:34:13,920 --> 03:34:15,610
No,
it happened to blink of an eye ago.

4503
03:34:15,670 --> 03:34:16,503
It happened.
It happened when anatomically modern 

4504
03:34:17,651 --> 03:34:20,230
humans had already been around for 
200,000

4505
03:34:20,231 --> 03:34:21,160
years.
Writing.

4506
03:34:21,250 --> 03:34:21,900
Well,
no,

4507
03:34:21,900 --> 03:34:22,733
but the,
the not according to the orthodox 

4508
03:34:23,981 --> 03:34:24,814
historians,
but if we're dealing with a lost 

4509
03:34:25,871 --> 03:34:27,790
civilization,
which I believe to be the case,

4510
03:34:27,791 --> 03:34:29,050
then yes,
it's totally,

4511
03:34:29,080 --> 03:34:31,690
it totally makes sense.
Completely.

4512
03:34:31,780 --> 03:34:32,940
Totally makes sense.
Yeah.

4513
03:34:33,100 --> 03:34:35,110
And it's time.
It's time to get to grips with this.

4514
03:34:35,111 --> 03:34:38,260
It's time to move,
move forward to the next level and start

4515
03:34:38,261 --> 03:34:39,094
recovering our memory,
yelling and also start recognizing that 

4516
03:34:41,081 --> 03:34:43,420
this is a,
this is a potential reality.

4517
03:34:43,790 --> 03:34:47,620
This is not just the past.
This is also very possible.

4518
03:34:47,650 --> 03:34:48,520
Yeah.
And,

4519
03:34:48,521 --> 03:34:49,330
and,
and again,

4520
03:34:49,330 --> 03:34:50,163
if I may say so crowdfunding,
it's the opportunity for the people to 

4521
03:34:55,001 --> 03:34:56,980
give their voice show.
Can you show that page?

4522
03:34:56,990 --> 03:34:57,823
This is the,
the crowdfunding page for the comment 

4523
03:34:59,951 --> 03:35:00,784
research group.

4524
03:35:01,330 --> 03:35:02,163
Um,
and it's on in the lake is on Graham 

4525
03:35:04,930 --> 03:35:07,390
Hancock.
So if you've got to Graham hancock.com

4526
03:35:07,391 --> 03:35:10,090

4527
03:35:10,490 --> 03:35:11,530

4528
03:35:11,560 --> 03:35:14,000

4530
03:35:15,520 --> 03:35:17,830
Whatever you can give,
it'll make all the difference.

4531
03:35:17,831 --> 03:35:21,580
It sends a message that we,
that we care about alternative,

4532
03:35:21,730 --> 03:35:26,590
heretical research and also what you're 
at my website.

4533
03:35:26,591 --> 03:35:29,560
I put up there a lot of other followups 
to this podcast.

4534
03:35:29,561 --> 03:35:32,540
If people want to go places,
I'm talking in America in the next weeks

4535
03:35:33,010 --> 03:35:33,843
and links and connections.
A lot of stuff related to this podcast 

4536
03:35:36,551 --> 03:35:39,940
is on my site.
I'd like to plug my ideas that has a lot

4537
03:35:39,941 --> 03:35:41,500
of these images on it.
Okay.

4538
03:35:41,570 --> 03:35:45,730
It's about five hours of stuff.
Blu Ray and if they go to the website,

4539
03:35:45,731 --> 03:35:46,564
sacred geometry international,
do you have that available as a 

4540
03:35:48,491 --> 03:35:51,250
download?
It's going to be if it's not already.

4541
03:35:52,300 --> 03:35:54,910
I think it is available for a download.
My laptop doesn't even,

4542
03:35:55,120 --> 03:35:57,280
I don't know.
Nobody's does anymore.

4543
03:35:57,310 --> 03:35:58,600
The answer is yes.
Okay.

4544
03:35:58,780 --> 03:36:00,250
It's not now.
It will be.

4545
03:36:00,251 --> 03:36:01,084
I think it is actually now available for
that and get it on itunes or Amazon or 

4546
03:36:04,241 --> 03:36:06,220
something,
hours of stuff.

4547
03:36:06,221 --> 03:36:08,360
But I get into a lot of other stuff,

4548
03:36:09,290 --> 03:36:10,123
some of the interesting sidelines,
the Rko astronomy and the sacred 

4549
03:36:13,431 --> 03:36:17,090
geometry and so forth that might be 
associated with ancient cultures.

4550
03:36:17,120 --> 03:36:17,953
And what's the name of this again?
I'm a cosmic patterns and cycles of 

4551
03:36:21,111 --> 03:36:22,580
Catastrophe.
Beautiful.

4552
03:36:22,610 --> 03:36:25,310
And is there it is,
yeah.

4553
03:36:25,311 --> 03:36:28,130
That's the older version.
This is the newer upgraded version.

4554
03:36:28,640 --> 03:36:29,750
All right.
Yeah,

4555
03:36:29,780 --> 03:36:31,040
there we go.
There we go.

4556
03:36:31,100 --> 03:36:32,650
Beautiful.
And there's the Blue Ray.

4557
03:36:32,930 --> 03:36:34,190
Yeah,

4558
03:36:34,220 --> 03:36:35,053
Yup.

An HD download.

4560
03:36:36,430 --> 03:36:37,810
Excellent Barrios.
Yeah.

4561
03:36:38,830 --> 03:36:42,160
Gentlemen,
this has been a long,

4562
03:36:42,310 --> 03:36:44,830
long podcast of awesomeness.
Hey man,

4563
03:36:44,860 --> 03:36:47,440
this a cemented in my head.
I may not the,

4564
03:36:47,540 --> 03:36:49,180
the idea was already cemented in my 
head,

4565
03:36:49,181 --> 03:36:50,014
but these images along with your 
compelling narrative is cemented even 

4566
03:36:52,901 --> 03:36:53,950
further.
It was amazing.

4567
03:36:54,520 --> 03:36:55,353
Such a cool podcast and a magic to 
entertain and scare the shit out of me 

4568
03:36:58,841 --> 03:37:01,810
at the same time.
So thank you for that Graham.

4569
03:37:01,910 --> 03:37:02,950

4580
03:37:24,431 --> 03:37:27,200

I got 100,000
followers there but they haven't yet.

4582
03:37:29,350 --> 03:37:32,120
They haven't verified me.
I am me.

4583
03:37:32,650 --> 03:37:33,483
Randall,
how much do you pay attention to social 

4584
03:37:34,241 --> 03:37:37,520
media at all?
The time.

4585
03:37:37,690 --> 03:37:38,523
I'll,
I'll immerse myself into it for a few 

4586
03:37:40,360 --> 03:37:44,430
days or as much as I can take.
And then I got to back off for a while.

4587
03:37:44,540 --> 03:37:45,373
Well you're going to get a flood of 
questions about this one cause this was 

4588
03:37:46,841 --> 03:37:48,730
awesome and really thank you so much.
I'm,

4589
03:37:48,830 --> 03:37:52,450
I'm so,
so thankful and honored to know you guys

4590
03:37:52,750 --> 03:37:53,583
because to me this is a,
I mean th th th the ultimate thing for 

4591
03:37:56,561 --> 03:37:57,394
me on this podcast is to be able to have
people on that are talking about things 

4592
03:38:01,271 --> 03:38:04,030
that I find absolutely captivating and 
you guys,

4593
03:38:04,960 --> 03:38:06,250
I think what you're doing is so 
important.

4594
03:38:06,320 --> 03:38:08,200
You'll takes huge role,
joe in,

4595
03:38:08,201 --> 03:38:11,800
in opening people's minds to unthinkable
thoughts all around the world.

4596
03:38:11,801 --> 03:38:14,860
Stuff that people had been told they are
not allowed to think about.

4597
03:38:15,010 --> 03:38:15,843
Your,
your show is opening doors that I've 

4598
03:38:17,741 --> 03:38:19,660
never been opened before.
Stumbled into it.

4599
03:38:19,870 --> 03:38:22,780
I don't know how it happened.
I would like to get you out in the field

4600
03:38:22,830 --> 03:38:23,663
though.
I would like to get out in the field to 

4601
03:38:24,501 --> 03:38:26,380
get you out in the field because you 
want to see that stuff.

4602
03:38:26,440 --> 03:38:27,273
Yeah.
That's what I want to go to Washington 

4603
03:38:27,791 --> 03:38:28,660
state.
Let's do it.

4604
03:38:28,690 --> 03:38:30,100
Let's set something out.
We'll make a video.

4605
03:38:30,130 --> 03:38:31,240
I want to go there.
I want to see that.

4606
03:38:31,270 --> 03:38:32,740
Let's do it.
That looks crazy serious.

4607
03:38:32,741 --> 03:38:33,910
This,
this is Jamie.

4608
03:38:33,911 --> 03:38:35,470
You in?
Jamie's in.

4609
03:38:35,550 --> 03:38:37,480
All right.
Thank you so much everybody.

4610
03:38:37,600 --> 03:38:38,433
See you soon.
