00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,580
Hello Freak bitches.
Well,

2
00:00:03,581 --> 00:00:05,620
you did some guys who just get trapped 
in a persona.

3
00:00:05,621 --> 00:00:06,454
We were just talking about emo phillips 
the other night cause emo phillips is 

4
00:00:08,861 --> 00:00:13,000
apparently back to his persona.
He let it go for a long time and he just

5
00:00:13,001 --> 00:00:15,670
started just being a guy on stage 
talking about shit.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,230
Apparently the people weren't into that.
He's like,

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,750
all right,
give the people what they want.

8
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:24,030
By the way,
I should just clarify this is,

9
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,450
which is what I've heard.
I haven't seen him,

10
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,040
but this is like,
um,

11
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:29,580
you know,
robin was a,

12
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:31,270
when he was,
was my best pal and,

13
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:34,060
and uh,
he got me a job on,

14
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:34,680
on,
uh,

15
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,350
a snickers commercial and I needed bread
and he was so nice.

16
00:00:38,351 --> 00:00:38,921
He's like,
Oh,

17
00:00:38,921 --> 00:00:39,640
you know,
you know,

18
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,730
so I want you to use my friend Bob cat.
You know,

19
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:42,760
he's gotta be in it,
you know,

20
00:00:42,761 --> 00:00:44,390
and like,
and they're like,

21
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:45,373
you know,
he actually put their feet on the fire 

22
00:00:48,161 --> 00:00:49,300
and they had to hire me.

23
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:50,890
And then he goes,
he's like,

24
00:00:50,891 --> 00:00:52,570
don't take the first money.
Just the way,

25
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,370
you know,
tell him no,

26
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:55,663
I tell him no.
And then they came back with more and 

27
00:00:58,001 --> 00:00:59,740
when you know,
I mean he was great.

28
00:00:59,741 --> 00:01:00,460
Right,
right.

29
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,293
So then he calls what,
because you know they're going to want 

30
00:01:02,381 --> 00:01:04,270
you to do the voice.
Are you okay doing the voice?

31
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:07,390
And I go for the amount of money 
snickers is paying.

32
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,980
I will fuck a snickers behind camera.
By the way.

33
00:01:11,981 --> 00:01:16,981
I should say it's a really big candy,
but it's my all time favorite.

34
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:19,101
You know,
I,

35
00:01:19,101 --> 00:01:20,200
I said I was going to go,
but,

36
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:21,583
well,
we'll address a little bit and talk 

37
00:01:22,911 --> 00:01:23,691
about,
you know,

38
00:01:23,691 --> 00:01:24,610
robin had,
um,

39
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:29,660
has his coroner's report came out and he
had lewy body dementia and that is a,

40
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:31,003
it's a form of dementia that is very 
rarely ever discovered when someone's 

41
00:01:36,171 --> 00:01:36,560
alive.

42
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,550
It's usually discovered in there.
They're a autopsy.

43
00:01:40,551 --> 00:01:44,930
So he had this form of dementia.
I witnessed it.

44
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:49,100
It was missed a diagnosis.
Parkinson's.

45
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:50,900
Ah,
and I,

46
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,033
I witnessed this eye witnesses 
processing reality completely different 

47
00:01:56,181 --> 00:01:59,540
than the way every body else does.
What causes it?

48
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,760
It's,
um,

49
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:03,900
I'm not sure if it's a gene or what,
but I mean it,

50
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:05,570
it is,
sadly,

51
00:02:05,571 --> 00:02:09,590
his brain was riddled with this.
And so when I think about that,

52
00:02:09,591 --> 00:02:13,670
I think about how strong he was.
You know,

53
00:02:13,671 --> 00:02:18,671
you would have like some days you'd have
a lot of days where he was doing kind of

54
00:02:19,251 --> 00:02:22,950
ocd stuff and processing things 
incorrectly,

55
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,040
but then you'd have a day where he was 
back.

56
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,970
So you'd go,
oh well maybe set a bad day or no,

57
00:02:28,971 --> 00:02:32,390
maybe it's the Parkinson's drugs.
And they've got to get those dialed in.

58
00:02:32,391 --> 00:02:33,140
You know,
he had,

59
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:35,780
he was going to doctors use in therapy,
he was doing,

60
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,130
and it just,
the only reason I talk about that is,

61
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,480
is his brain was giving him 
misinformation,

62
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:43,370
completeness,
Information.

63
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:49,240
And I don't if some people die from 
depression and uh,

64
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:53,180
and my heart goes out to them,
but that's not what killed him.

65
00:02:53,181 --> 00:02:54,230
He,
he,

66
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,333
he really was getting misinformation 
from his own brain and was suffering 

67
00:02:58,761 --> 00:02:59,594
from disease.
So I just put that out there because I 

68
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:05,280
folks know that we were friends in 
there.

69
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,980
They'll ask me about it.
And,

70
00:03:06,981 --> 00:03:07,814
and,
and I would like a spotlight put on the 

71
00:03:10,931 --> 00:03:11,764
disease.
That actually in my mind was what was 

72
00:03:15,281 --> 00:03:18,150
responsible for its demise.
Because,

73
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,640
you know,
a lot of people say,

74
00:03:19,641 --> 00:03:22,390
did he ever talk about suicide ago?
Comics,

75
00:03:22,391 --> 00:03:25,190
we talked about suicide for 33 years.
You know,

76
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,420
sometimes we talk about other shit,
you know,

77
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,150
hey,
congratulations on the ASCA.

78
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:30,761
Oh,
thank you.

79
00:03:30,761 --> 00:03:31,600
How would you do it?
I don't know.

80
00:03:31,601 --> 00:03:33,770
I think a car,
you know,

81
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:36,730
but I just say that because he fought,
you know,

82
00:03:36,731 --> 00:03:37,540
that's what we do.

83
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,340
I don't know about you,
but it comic,

84
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,200
that's what we do.
We fight depression.

85
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,450
Things don't add up.
It doesn't,

86
00:03:43,451 --> 00:03:45,580
this world doesn't seem right.
And we'd go out and we spew,

87
00:03:45,581 --> 00:03:49,420
but it,
and I feel better on a selfish level.

88
00:03:49,421 --> 00:03:53,080
I don't really give a rat's ass,
you know,

89
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,620
I vent and I feel better.
And,

90
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:58,480
and,
and he fought it.

91
00:03:58,481 --> 00:04:01,090
And that wasn't,
it wasn't depression.

92
00:04:01,091 --> 00:04:02,170
It wasn't career.
It wasn't,

93
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:05,200
you know,
he'd been sober most of his adult life,

94
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,130
you know,
so,

95
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:06,993
so it was very disturbing to me that a 
lot of people were trying to attribute 

96
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:13,180
all sorts of reasons for why he did it.
And even there was a lot of like,

97
00:04:13,181 --> 00:04:14,014
um,
well that's the main thing is rights 

98
00:04:15,101 --> 00:04:19,470
groups that were attributing it to his 
divorce settlements.

99
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,320
Brother.
Yeah.

100
00:04:20,321 --> 00:04:21,154
There was a whole thing where this guy 
was doing this video and I even talked 

101
00:04:25,451 --> 00:04:26,284
to him about it.

102
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,010
It's,
he,

103
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,053
he had a disease.
He had a disease that caused dementia 

104
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:38,320
that I witnessed.
I didn't have anybody.

105
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:40,280
I talked to him more,
you know,

106
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:45,300
I talked to him and text and every day I
didn't have a buddy that I talked to him

107
00:04:46,021 --> 00:04:48,190
more.
So just to be,

108
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:52,840
it wasn't a divorce.
It was,

109
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:54,410
it didn't,
it wasn't as family.

110
00:04:54,411 --> 00:04:56,380
It wasn't,
we have the same agent.

111
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:57,573
So like when this guy was saying,
this is one of the reason why it pissed 

112
00:04:59,561 --> 00:05:01,030
me off because he's guy was saying that,
you know,

113
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,720
he's in financial ruins.
Like,

114
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,400
no,
he wasn't.

115
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,690
No,
he was wealthy.

116
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,610
Yeah.
Yeah.

117
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,150
And also it's,
it's,

118
00:05:07,151 --> 00:05:08,800
uh,
it's,

119
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:09,580
yeah,
I mean,

120
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,850
no one wants to,
uh,

121
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:14,440
because we as human beings,
we're trying to make sense of,

122
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,460
of,
of,

123
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:20,550
of why w why that happened and why that 
happened in my opinion,

124
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,143
which is right,
was his brain was who would know more 

125
00:05:25,001 --> 00:05:25,330
than you?

126
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:28,270
It was his brain was getting,
uh,

127
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:31,990
misinformation and he was processing 
reality completely wrong.

128
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:34,150
I mean,
I W I won't go into details,

129
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:39,420
but I did witness him thinking things 
that weren't real or happening and to me

130
00:05:43,151 --> 00:05:44,800
in the middle of the night.
And that's the only thing.

131
00:05:44,801 --> 00:05:45,461
Like people say,
oh,

132
00:05:45,461 --> 00:05:47,200
he wasn't in the same bedroom as his 
wife.

133
00:05:47,201 --> 00:05:47,621
It's like,
yeah,

134
00:05:47,621 --> 00:05:50,290
because he was having seizures and he 
didn't like to wake her up.

135
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:51,783
Oh God.
It's not a question of somebody not 

136
00:05:53,951 --> 00:05:56,140
getting along.
I didn't mean to get so personal.

137
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:57,123
I don't mean,
and I don't mean to talk about about 

138
00:05:59,181 --> 00:05:59,930
his,
his,

139
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:03,270
uh,
his home life because you know,

140
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,100
Susan's a wonderful Gal and,
and,

141
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,710
and it's just sad,
you know?

142
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,030
No,
it's awful.

143
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,080
That's the one of the scariest things is
I'm talking to someone who's,

144
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,530
whether it's a loved one,
a father,

145
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,790
mother that's losing their grip.

146
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:24,810
And I think people were s they were 
courteous to a point,

147
00:06:24,811 --> 00:06:26,550
but I don't think they,
they take his,

148
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:28,103
his kids and the consideration and 
friends and people worked with them for 

149
00:06:32,581 --> 00:06:34,830
all these years.
And I guess I can't expect them to,

150
00:06:34,831 --> 00:06:35,664
you know,
I mean I'm sure I've taken shots at 

151
00:06:36,751 --> 00:06:39,540
people when they pass away,
but it's just,

152
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,500
it's like people would come up and they 
go,

153
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,920
did you hear?
What did you,

154
00:06:43,921 --> 00:06:45,540
what rush limbaugh said?
And I'd be like,

155
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:46,823
I don't care what it says.
I'm dealing with people who dealt well 

156
00:06:50,381 --> 00:06:52,630
then we had a daily basis.
Let me ask you this,

157
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:56,470
what is it,
what is this impulse that people have to

158
00:06:56,530 --> 00:07:00,790
denigrate people right after they die?
It's almost like everyone else is,

159
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,373
everyone else is talking about that.
Like I saw a lot of that with prince 

160
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:10,060
when it was revealed that prince was 
suffering through opiate addiction.

161
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,320
Yeah.
And I was like,

162
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:14,440
well there was like even gene Simmons 
said some crazy shit.

163
00:07:14,441 --> 00:07:17,580
And he had to apologize.
And I'd seen some other people say too,

164
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:20,410
but what,
it's almost like it's a crunch,

165
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:23,380
a contrarian thing.
Like everyone else is saying,

166
00:07:23,381 --> 00:07:25,090
oh you got,
we lost his genius.

167
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,900
Well you get heat from it and I'm sure 
in Gene Simmons is,

168
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,750
you know,
I'm sure there's a jealousy thing,

169
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:32,740
but you say,
look,

170
00:07:32,741 --> 00:07:35,170
I used to say outrageous things about 
people and,

171
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,000
and this bomb will go off and I would 
get,

172
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:42,580
I would get some heat and now I get some
buzz and I stopped doing that.

173
00:07:42,581 --> 00:07:44,440
I made a decision,
you know,

174
00:07:44,441 --> 00:07:48,670
realizing that these weren't just a 
harmless things I was saying.

175
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,360
Right,
right,

176
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,141
right.
You just,

177
00:07:50,141 --> 00:07:51,680
yeah.
Yeah.

178
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,280
You know,
it was,

179
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:56,523
yeah.
Cause there are a lot of that when Kurt 

180
00:07:57,191 --> 00:07:58,024
cobain died too.

181
00:07:58,740 --> 00:07:59,461
But yeah.
You know,

182
00:07:59,461 --> 00:08:03,660
and that's the way,
I wasn't best these with Kurt,

183
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:06,630
but I did know him.
I toured with Nirvana,

184
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:07,463
Kurt,
like my standup and asked me to go on 

185
00:08:08,731 --> 00:08:11,170
the road with them.
I did a bunch of date.

186
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:12,150
No,
we talked about it.

187
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,013
But,
but I,

188
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:15,270
I mean,
it wasn't like the situation was wrong,

189
00:08:15,271 --> 00:08:16,104
but,
but I did have times in my life where I 

190
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:23,690
spent hours with Kurt when no one else 
sitting around talking and laughing,

191
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,100
you know?
Um,

192
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,770
I don't know why we want to do that.
I think,

193
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,920
I think,
I think we try to make sense of it.

194
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,770
Trying to make sense of it,
I think.

195
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:37,830
I think that's where a lot of 
conspiracies come from.

196
00:08:37,831 --> 00:08:38,664
I think when,
when someone who's in our mind reached 

197
00:08:41,531 --> 00:08:42,364
the American dream and then they die or 
look or con or take their life or 

198
00:08:47,251 --> 00:08:49,260
overdose,
we have to say,

199
00:08:49,261 --> 00:08:50,520
well,
they had it all.

200
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,750
And that's what we believe is the 
ultimate fulfillment and happiness.

201
00:08:54,751 --> 00:08:55,584
You know,
America is like People's Republic of 

202
00:08:57,351 --> 00:08:58,530
spring break.
You know what?

203
00:08:58,531 --> 00:09:02,160
No one's pursuing fulfillment.
Everyone's pursuing happiness.

204
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,140
You know,
there's two different things.

205
00:09:04,141 --> 00:09:06,750
I'm really fulfilled.
Am I happy?

206
00:09:06,751 --> 00:09:08,670
Am I laughing?
I don't think I might know.

207
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:11,190
But you're happy sometimes.
I'm happy a lot of the time.

208
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:11,541
Yeah.
Well,

209
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:12,730
I've never,
not top here.

210
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,750
Like,
if I didn't know that you're this nuance

211
00:09:15,751 --> 00:09:16,584
guy that's very thoughtful and you have 
a lot of opinions and you're always 

212
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:23,940
considering all sensitive.
If I just took like if I tried to form a

213
00:09:23,941 --> 00:09:27,630
view of you based on you and I talking,
we're always laughing.

214
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:29,460
Yeah.
I would say bobcat.

215
00:09:29,461 --> 00:09:33,540
So jolly every toddler talking to them 
like laughs and hugs and,

216
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,540
but it is true and it's,
and it's uh,

217
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:37,853
uh,
cause we never see each other before 

218
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:39,360
noon.

219
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,140
First of all,
it's a,

220
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,780
it's a,
it's a daily reprieve.

221
00:09:45,781 --> 00:09:47,880
It's a daily decision.
You know,

222
00:09:47,881 --> 00:09:51,780
I get up,
the squirrels are up before I do and I,

223
00:09:51,781 --> 00:09:56,280
and I beat him down and then it turns 
and when I'm directing on a set,

224
00:09:56,281 --> 00:09:57,114
I'm like,
I can react and fear or I can just sit 

225
00:09:59,731 --> 00:10:02,940
here for a second or two and it all,
he's usually works out.

226
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:05,880
Very rarely do I have to say no man,
this is,

227
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:09,720
you just sit there.
I think so much of show business,

228
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,450
everything's based on fear and people 
thinking someone's going to say,

229
00:10:12,451 --> 00:10:13,284
you screwed up or you didn't do it right
or you didn't get extra takes and all 

230
00:10:15,751 --> 00:10:16,950
that stuff.
But man,

231
00:10:16,951 --> 00:10:21,951
my job is really not to to freak out.
I'm really happy right now.

232
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:33,240
[inaudible] okay.
