1
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:10,430
And where are you writing notes?
Yes.

2
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:11,713
What are you writing notes about?
Just things that would be cool if we 

3
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:18,500
talk about.
What are you organized to do that?

4
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,540
Man,
I just know you don't like me looking at

5
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:22,010
my computer so.
Well,

6
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:23,600
trying to go analog.
Yeah.

7
00:00:23,601 --> 00:00:24,434
I think both of us would be better off 
in these things if we just said it's so 

8
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:31,550
easy to just start reading computers,
especially when you read and shit that's

9
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,260
on the Internet.
Just to get when one person's talking to

10
00:00:34,261 --> 00:00:35,094
start thinking about the next thing 
you're going to read about instead of 

11
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,620
just talking,
you know,

12
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:42,140
there's just too much.
It's too much coming at us.

13
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,450
It's like obsessive.
I like to obsessive Lee,

14
00:00:44,451 --> 00:00:47,100
like fact check though and like make 
sure I'm saying the right thing.

15
00:00:47,101 --> 00:00:47,934
So you

16
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,420
get trumped later.
Yeah.

17
00:00:51,421 --> 00:00:53,400
You uh,
you have to with this stuff.

18
00:00:53,401 --> 00:00:54,234
But I mean don't think it's like harder 
to form an opinion now than it's ever 

19
00:00:57,781 --> 00:00:59,070
been before.
Oh yeah.

20
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:02,580
It's insane.
I mean just looking back at old videos,

21
00:01:02,581 --> 00:01:03,960
I'm like,
oh that's a different day.

22
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:04,973
You know,
I,

23
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:08,820
I should probably delete this now if 
you,

24
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,670
you know,
like the,

25
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,700
the amount of data that you take in 
today as opposed to just 20 years ago.

26
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:19,890
Like when I,
when I see something,

27
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,590
anything that's happened and I read a 
story about something,

28
00:01:22,591 --> 00:01:24,690
I got to throw it through like 10 
filters.

29
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:26,670
I kind of like,
is this real?

30
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:27,950
This is bullshit.
Like who,

31
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,460
who's making this?
What is this?

32
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:31,170
Then you have to trust,
you know,

33
00:01:31,171 --> 00:01:32,770
like every time someone sends you some 
how,

34
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:33,623
what articles on.
That's what I always do with Eddie 

35
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:36,533
Bravo.
Every Eddie Bravo hit me up with some 

36
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:37,980
crazy shit.
I go,

37
00:01:37,981 --> 00:01:40,440
okay,
what before you get too excited.

38
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:44,970
What website was this world?
Truther organization West.

39
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,490
You know,
like there's some nutty fucking articles

40
00:01:47,491 --> 00:01:51,180
that are written that aren't real.
It's hard to figure out what the fuck is

41
00:01:51,181 --> 00:01:53,360
really going on with some things.
Yeah.

42
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:58,420
And they're so tricky now to like go be 
like NBC News Dot Com Dot Com.

43
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,140
You know,
I'd just like to.com.

44
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:03,243
There's fucking weird ones man.
Like I saw one the other day that I 

45
00:02:06,781 --> 00:02:08,190
think was a scam,

46
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,063
it was for some,
some fucking brain pill and it lead you 

47
00:02:14,491 --> 00:02:16,950
to some NBC looking website.
And I was like,

48
00:02:16,951 --> 00:02:18,660
what is this?
That's what I'm talking about.

49
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,450
Followed this rabbit hole of,
okay,

50
00:02:21,451 --> 00:02:23,010
what happens when you click that?
Okay,

51
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,510
what's going on over here?

52
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,673
Yeah,
it's like a fake cnn where it's just 

53
00:02:26,931 --> 00:02:27,790
like.
And it has like a,

54
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:28,983
like an article about this brain pill 
and you're reading it as if CNN wrote 

55
00:02:32,431 --> 00:02:33,264
this article it,
there's a lot of those brain pilled 

56
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,990
things too in the soylent soylent.
Uh,

57
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:42,330
it's like that all.
It's like a full meal.

58
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,060
Yeah.
And they,

59
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:43,893
they released these bars the other day 
or recently and all these people are 

60
00:02:47,281 --> 00:02:49,370
going to the hospital and like they,
they,

61
00:02:49,371 --> 00:02:51,730
they sent it to the lab trying to figure
out what it is.

62
00:02:51,731 --> 00:02:54,390
Is this a fact check thing?
This is true.

63
00:02:54,391 --> 00:02:57,810
And so they just recalled all these 
protein bars,

64
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:00,340
like the whole thing.
And

65
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,263
it's like this one guy couldn't stop 
throwing up and you have to go far just 

66
00:03:05,321 --> 00:03:07,590
from these pills.
Are these uh,

67
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:09,490
food bars?
Oh my God,

68
00:03:09,491 --> 00:03:11,260
what's in these fucking things?
I don't know.

69
00:03:11,261 --> 00:03:15,020
But the old soylent is people thing.
You think they would change their name?

70
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:19,930
Fucking giant line in a science fiction 
movie.

71
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,130
A movie.
I know.

72
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,120
So I let green is paypal.
That's what they said,

73
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:27,010
right?
Wasn't that the line was in the movie?

74
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,140
Yeah.
Speaking of bullies,

75
00:03:29,141 --> 00:03:31,680
but not really.
This is not happening already.

76
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:34,690
Should fear show premieres tonight?
Midnight.

77
00:03:34,691 --> 00:03:37,060
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm in.

78
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,213
He,
I know he's got a lot of funny fucking 

79
00:03:39,551 --> 00:03:41,200
people on the season.
It's a great show.

80
00:03:41,201 --> 00:03:42,034
If you haven't seen it before,
it's really one of the best shows on 

81
00:03:43,871 --> 00:03:47,170
television because it's,
it's really funny.

82
00:03:47,171 --> 00:03:51,280
People like Joey Diaz and I mean he's 
had stan hope bond.

83
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,790
I know Rawlins is on the season.
Henry rollins notice I said rollins.

84
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:59,020
It's like when people used to pretend 
they knew Eddie Murphy,

85
00:03:59,021 --> 00:04:00,040
they just call him Eddie.
You know,

86
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:02,610
me and Eddie were tight.
We're just type me.

87
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,310
Uh,
you know,

88
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,990
just hang out together.
You know what,

89
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:06,620
you don't want to say his last name.
Like Eddie who?

90
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:09,490
Murphy Pro Murphy.
I'm trying to think.

91
00:04:09,491 --> 00:04:10,324
Is there anyone that you.
I mean if you really were hanging out 

92
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:13,940
with them,
like,

93
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:17,170
like sharing a pizza or you know,
would you call him by his last name?

94
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,190
Rawlins?
No,

95
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:19,080
I definitely wouldn't.
Not.

96
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:23,650
That would be so,
so like,

97
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,281
hey,
rogen.

98
00:04:24,281 --> 00:04:25,270
I'd be like,
Oh man,

99
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:27,280
yeah,
that's.

100
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,780
But actually no,
that's not bad.

101
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:33,520
It depends on the length of the name.
Right?

102
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:37,540
Like if your name,
if you have a long crazy name,

103
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,680
like a fatal or a million Ngo,
if you like.

104
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,950
Hey,
a million inco,

105
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:44,590
like my name's faith or pitch,
just call me fader.

106
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:46,780
That's when you get a nickname real 
quick.

107
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,370
Yeah.
You have to get a nickname.

108
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:51,000
You know?
What about Jerry Seinfeld?

109
00:04:51,001 --> 00:04:53,080
You would probably say Mr Seinfeld,
right?

110
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,170
Or I would say Mr Seinfeld.
I said Mr Ventura,

111
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:58,450
when I met Jesse Ventura,
I called him Sir.

112
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,433
I always try to show,
especially to like older guys that I 

113
00:05:02,021 --> 00:05:02,854
like.
I was trying to show them a lot of 

114
00:05:03,431 --> 00:05:04,630
respect.
Yeah.

115
00:05:04,631 --> 00:05:07,180
If I met Seinfeld for sure,
I'd called him Mr Seinfeld,

116
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:08,163
Jerry Seinfeld,
but if you're sharing a pizza like 

117
00:05:10,001 --> 00:05:11,930
watching a movie,
Mr Seinfeld,

118
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:15,220
let me ask you this.
It will be weird.

119
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:18,070
That's weird.
That's weird,

120
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,083
but let me tell me like some young kid 
who's seen you online for all these 

121
00:05:21,101 --> 00:05:22,240
years,
hasn't done that to you.

122
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,760
Oh yeah.
We went in.

123
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,870
Friends call me red bad.
It's gross.

124
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,570
Like what the fuck?
My name is Brian.

125
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,080
People introduce me as red.
It's gross.

126
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,850
You're like a rapper.
You have a name?

127
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:35,010
Yeah.
Did you know,

128
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:38,560
did we already say this?
Did you know red man?

129
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,120
The rapper?
Yeah.

130
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:44,380
Has a group called death death squad 
squad.

131
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,330
That's like simulation shit.
Holy Shit.

132
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,710
I had no idea.
It's like parallel universe.

133
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:56,970
It's fucking weird.
That's so bizarre.

134
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:03,500
It's so bizarre and totally independent 
of each other and just think.

135
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:07,070
Think of like how many different 
variables that are in between.

136
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:12,490
Is there a red baron deaf squad?
Redman deaf squad.

137
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:19,700
Larry is dude always go.
Eric sermon from epmd.

138
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:26,650
Dude,
he's like one of the best rappers of all

139
00:06:26,961 --> 00:06:29,900
time and he's got like a weird speech 
thing going on.

140
00:06:29,901 --> 00:06:32,000
Right?
I don't know him.

141
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:36,410
EPMD dude.
I used to love epmd.

142
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,740
You don't know epmd.
I definitely know the name,

143
00:06:39,741 --> 00:06:44,741
but that's a generation just above my 
dude old school hip hop.

144
00:06:45,141 --> 00:06:47,990
What's the main song?
I probably know the songs.

145
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:51,110
They probably just don't really have in 
listening to their shit in a long time.

146
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:53,720
I used to be a giant fan.
Strictly business.

147
00:06:53,721 --> 00:06:54,940
Yes.
There we go.

148
00:06:55,850 --> 00:07:00,850
We'll go to like a uh,
an album strictly business was great.

149
00:07:01,851 --> 00:07:04,460
You got to chose great business.

150
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:07,340
They still got my space.
How about safety profile?

151
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:10,250
Here's something that people forget.
Big Daddy Kane.

152
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:12,710
Follow the leader.
Yeah,

153
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:13,820
dude,
what was that?

154
00:07:13,821 --> 00:07:15,470
Eric B and Rakim?
Eric B.

155
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:17,660
and Rakim was follow the leader.
Big Daddy Kane.

156
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:21,800
Goddamn big.
Daddy cane had a bunch of giant hits.

157
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:22,693
I met him when I was a kid.
My cousin loved him and he went to his 

158
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:30,470
show in Florida.
Let's see what his.

159
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:31,543
What would the big daddy cane hits where
ain't no half stuff and I get the job 

160
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:39,950
done.
Yeah.

161
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:44,900
He had a lot of great shit.
Taste the chocolate album.

162
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:49,850
He had a great style to like a great 
smooth,

163
00:07:49,851 --> 00:07:54,290
quick style of rapping.
I wish we could play some of this.

164
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:57,700
Hate is yanked off mother fucking juice.

165
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:03,470
It's too bad,
but it educate yourself folks.

166
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,150
Go get it.
Get Ahold of some big daddy kane.

167
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:08,300
Go listen to Kool Moe dee.
I go to work.

168
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,420
You gotta.
Think back then.

169
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:18,950
Rap was only a few years old.
That's what's even cooler about it.

170
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,070
Like if you listen to Kool Moe dee,
I go to work.

171
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:25,370
Let me take a guess because I listened 
to that when I was a kid.

172
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,490
If I had a guest.
That's a song from the eighties,

173
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,301
right?
Yeah,

174
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:30,930
I would say that 1989.
Yeah.

175
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,830
Okay,
so I went to school.

176
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,053
I went to a a middle school in Jamaica 
Plain Massachusetts when I was 13 years 

177
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:45,041
old and I remember that's when that hip 
hop hip it to the hippity hop.

178
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:50,540
That's when that was going on.
That's when the sugar hill gang had just

179
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:55,440
come out with the first rap music ever 
that I had ever rather.

180
00:08:55,441 --> 00:08:56,550
I mean,
there might've been some before,

181
00:08:56,551 --> 00:09:00,210
but that was the first mainstream rap 
that I was exposed to as a kid.

182
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:06,500
So that was 1980 I think.
Come on.

183
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,780
This is good shit.
Yeah.

184
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,660
Come on man.
Kool moe dee.

185
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:16,890
Look at the glasses.
That's great.

186
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:20,520
Now is this.
How does not get us kicked off Youtube?

187
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:24,240
Okay.
Let's hope Kool moe dee doesn't fuck.

188
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,060
Which I was trying to give you props 
dude.

189
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,710
When ll cool J.
uh,

190
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,600
you know,
don't call it a comeback.

191
00:09:30,601 --> 00:09:31,434
Came out.
I had a Ford Taurus and I had like the 

192
00:09:32,881 --> 00:09:33,714
best base ever,
but that time period of music was 

193
00:09:36,121 --> 00:09:37,800
exciting because it.
Dude,

194
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:38,723
ll cool J is a bad mother fucker,
but people don't like to give ll cool j 

195
00:09:43,951 --> 00:09:46,840
too much props because he's too good 
looking and he's two years old.

196
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,700
Yeah.
He's always eating ice cream like it.

197
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:52,060
He's jacked.
He's built like a superhero.

198
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:54,220
It was a beautiful man,
somber form.

199
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:56,090
The summer in Columbus.
He was at.

200
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:56,983
He headlined a big festival and there 
was a ton of the ladies that were just 

201
00:10:00,261 --> 00:10:03,170
rapping all his old songs,
like getting excited for the night,

202
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,390
like just walking up thing in the 
phenomenon.

203
00:10:05,391 --> 00:10:08,150
And did he.
Did he play the old stuff?

204
00:10:08,151 --> 00:10:10,000
Yeah.
Even at one point I stopped.

205
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:10,831
The show is like,
right,

206
00:10:10,831 --> 00:10:13,490
well you guys want some new shit.
You went to old shit and there was like,

207
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,590
oh shit.

208
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:17,460
That's crazy.
Wow.

209
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:19,740
Mama said,
knock you out.

210
00:10:19,741 --> 00:10:20,910
I mean,
come on dude,

211
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:25,290
come on Song doesn't Jack you up when 
you're on the elliptical machine.

212
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:31,130
It's a great fucking song and it's so 
loud.

213
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:33,830
And going back to Cali,
Cali,

214
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:37,410
come on man.
He's got some great songs,

215
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:43,130
great songs.
Her Bikini small heels tall.

216
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:48,710
She said she likes the ocean.
She chooses to really listen to that.

217
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:54,960
I haven't heard that fucking song rules.
And again,

218
00:10:54,961 --> 00:10:57,270
I mean think ll cool j one.
When was that?

219
00:10:57,271 --> 00:10:59,490
When was going back to Cali?
That was probably the nineties.

220
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:00,290
Yeah,
80.

221
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:01,250
Same.
Same time period,

222
00:11:01,251 --> 00:11:02,130
right?
Eighty nine.

223
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,473
80 seven.

224
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,090
What about um,
uh,

225
00:11:06,091 --> 00:11:09,000
go to work that what we just said that 
it's 89,

226
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,000
right?
Yeah.

227
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:11,920
So what about,
uh,

228
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:12,990
going back to Cali

229
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,150
88,
89,

230
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:19,470
right.
I was a middle school.

231
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,530
80 nine.
That's insane.

232
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,870
That's insane.
Yeah.

233
00:11:24,871 --> 00:11:26,670
I was just about to graduate high 
school.

234
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,870
No,
I graduated high school.

235
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:30,030
80 five.
80 nine was.

236
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,220
I thought that's so weird.
My brain works.

237
00:11:32,221 --> 00:11:34,140
I think of graduating high school.

238
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:37,730
80 eight,
87 released January 27th,

239
00:11:37,731 --> 00:11:38,400
1988.

240
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,233
[inaudible] 88.
I think of a graduating high school and 

241
00:11:41,461 --> 00:11:45,450
the day I started comedy I superimpose 
those times,

242
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:46,703
like literally are you think of those 
are the two milestones of my youth for 

243
00:11:50,341 --> 00:11:52,230
sure.
Graduating high school,

244
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:56,830
1985 and then starting comedy 1988.
Those are the big milestones.

245
00:11:56,831 --> 00:11:59,110
So sometimes I confabulated them.
Is that the word?

246
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,140
No,
might not be the right word.

247
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,033
Stepped out of my lane again.
Do you have one of those word of the 

248
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:07,290
day?
Like calendars and everyday you,

249
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,290
you,
you look at it?

250
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:09,200
No,
no.

251
00:12:09,201 --> 00:12:13,240
I just try to find a good word that fits
my friend has one of those and every day

252
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:16,060
she tries to use a new word and I'm just
like the word,

253
00:12:16,061 --> 00:12:17,260
isn't it?
What is this?

254
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,750
Okay.
In Psychiatry,

255
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:23,950
psychiatry.
Confabulation is a disturbance of memory

256
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,143
defined as the production of fabricated,
distorted or misinterpreted memories 

257
00:12:28,721 --> 00:12:33,550
about oneself or the world without 
conscious intention to deceive.

258
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,940
Never used it.
Right.

259
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:38,703
How do they use it again?
What did I write that I confabulated 

260
00:12:42,931 --> 00:12:46,840
them,
but I know that I'm wrong once I say it.

261
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,960
Okay.
So it was a disturbance of memory?

262
00:12:49,961 --> 00:12:50,800
Yeah.
So it's right.

263
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,420
Confabulation.
Okay.

264
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,560
Yeah,
I did.

265
00:12:55,561 --> 00:12:57,760
Um,
I think about it man.

266
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,770
Think about those like the date you 
graduated high school.

267
00:13:02,771 --> 00:13:05,590
Did you ever have nightmares that you 
had to go back?

268
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:09,880
That you didn't take tests?
I slept through most of high school,

269
00:13:09,881 --> 00:13:10,714
like the whole,
the whole school I was sleeping so it 

270
00:13:13,321 --> 00:13:16,540
was all a dream to me.
I actually probably slept honestly,

271
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,120
40 percent of high school.
Why?

272
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:22,330
Because I only liked art class and 
that's all I liked.

273
00:13:22,331 --> 00:13:23,164
I hated everything else except English.
I liked English class because I liked 

274
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:27,043
like stories and writing crazy shit.
I have to bring this up because I 

275
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:33,040
brought her up on the podcast before 
there was a guy,

276
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:35,040
I think I told you that,
um,

277
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:35,883
when I was in high school that I had a,
an art teacher that was just a Douche 

278
00:13:39,311 --> 00:13:40,144
bag.
He just was not nice and he was like 

279
00:13:41,981 --> 00:13:44,320
really negative and he must have been 
depressed.

280
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,430
I mean,
the guy,

281
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:46,263
he was just wasn't a happy guy and um,
he made me stop doing art because I 

282
00:13:50,201 --> 00:13:51,910
didn't want to be in his class.
I was like,

283
00:13:51,911 --> 00:13:52,750
he was just,
he,

284
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:57,960
I liked frank frazetta illustrations and
I like comic book illustrations.

285
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,473
That's what I was really into learning 
how to do and this guy was just like 

286
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,700
pissing on dreams,
you know,

287
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:06,160
just saying like,
you'll never be able to do that.

288
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:10,990
You're going to have to be able to do 
advertisements for magazines that's most

289
00:14:10,991 --> 00:14:13,990
likely where you're going to work.
He was just super negative,

290
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:18,160
but there was one guy in the class that 
was the most talented guy by far.

291
00:14:18,161 --> 00:14:18,994
His name's John Devor and I talked about
on the podcast and John reached out to 

292
00:14:23,531 --> 00:14:24,364
me,
Oh fuck,

293
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,293
John Got Ahold of me and um,
he told me that he fucking quit that 

294
00:14:30,101 --> 00:14:30,670
guy's class.

295
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,290
That guy failed him.
And I'm like,

296
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,080
and this guy was insanely talented.
He was like,

297
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:37,630
this is like,
I was always pretty good,

298
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:39,760
but there was always,
it was another guy in our class.

299
00:14:39,761 --> 00:14:41,290
It was better than me too.
His name was Kevin.

300
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:45,400
He was a football player who's a big,
stocky fucking dude.

301
00:14:45,401 --> 00:14:46,780
And his brother was on the football 
team.

302
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:48,490
Got Damn.
I wish I could remember his last name,

303
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:51,190
but those were the two guys.
I was like number three.

304
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,870
Those are two guys who they were.
And it was all this.

305
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:57,080
We all did the same style of was all 
comic book,

306
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:57,943
illustration Type Shit.
And devor could draw like he was the 

307
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:01,874
most versatile.
He could draw like things like he could 

308
00:15:05,331 --> 00:15:06,164
draw a beautiful things like huge,
huge or rose or you could draw a 

309
00:15:07,701 --> 00:15:11,320
monster.
I can only draw monsters how to draw and

310
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,580
look like shit,
but I draw a fucked up,

311
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:16,090
you know,
Werewolf's for something like that.

312
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:16,923
And so that was into that kind of stuff 
and in all three of us were into like 

313
00:15:20,391 --> 00:15:25,370
that sort of comic book style aren't.
And this fucking teacher just,

314
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,233
she,
she,

315
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,103
I mean he rather uh,
got the most talented guy in the class 

316
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,410
and gave them an f.
yeah.

317
00:15:33,411 --> 00:15:37,610
When he told me that I went what I think
he said give him an f that's fucked up.

318
00:15:37,611 --> 00:15:38,444
And that teacher went in,
exists in today's world because you 

319
00:15:39,771 --> 00:15:42,060
would have filmed him,
you would have put on Youtube.

320
00:15:42,061 --> 00:15:42,894
But when it became a news story,
it would have been like checking the 

321
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:49,460
teachers is like another big thing where
it is.

322
00:15:49,461 --> 00:15:50,294
But it's when a teacher has tenure,
it can be really difficult in certain 

323
00:15:54,081 --> 00:15:55,080
schools,
you know,

324
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,620
I know they have that problem with that 
in certain universities.

325
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,040
Teachers have tenure,
like you really can't fire them.

326
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:04,520
And once they know they can't be fired.
Like if they can be like really,

327
00:16:04,521 --> 00:16:09,380
really radical and some crazy fucking 
ideas and teach your kids some shit that

328
00:16:09,381 --> 00:16:10,214
you don't agree with that no one agrees 
with and if they get into a university 

329
00:16:13,941 --> 00:16:17,090
and they get into the system and your 
kid winds up in their class,

330
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,313
I mean some really crazy teachers out 
there and there's this guy in Toronto 

331
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:24,703
who is a professor and they are 
demanding that he take a sensitivity 

332
00:16:29,271 --> 00:16:30,104
courses and all kinds of crazy shit and 
they're calling him transphobic because 

333
00:16:34,881 --> 00:16:39,440
you won't use the 28 different gender 
pronouns that are available today.

334
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:44,150
Like 30 fucking gender pronouns.
So talking to him.

335
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,273
They're calling him transphobic and 
gender binary gender believer and this 

336
00:16:51,591 --> 00:16:54,830
guy is a lashing out.
Instead of backing off,

337
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:55,693
he's decided to make more and more 
educational youtube videos about what's 

338
00:16:58,341 --> 00:17:02,840
wrong with this kind of censorship 
because he was.

339
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,420
He saying is,
and I agree with this,

340
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,153
if you look at a lot of like what's 
going on with like maybe what people 

341
00:17:10,221 --> 00:17:11,054
would call a social justice warrior or 
people want to shut people down from 

342
00:17:14,121 --> 00:17:16,700
being able to say something.
What's going on,

343
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:21,260
it's like there's this need to control 
and there's a.

344
00:17:21,261 --> 00:17:22,094
there's like a need to control other 
people and to push your idea on other 

345
00:17:26,931 --> 00:17:28,640
people whether or not they agree with 
you or not.

346
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,270
That mirrors the same thing that happens
with religions.

347
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,960
It's like you might be right or you 
might not be right.

348
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:36,823
There might be an argument against what 
you're saying that you might have to 

349
00:17:38,361 --> 00:17:42,080
consider like in that one when people 
get an idea one way in their head,

350
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,293
they don't want to consider any other 
possibilities and when you see these 

351
00:17:47,151 --> 00:17:50,160
kids rallying against this professor,

352
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:50,993
it's never been more evident because 
this professor is brilliant and what 

353
00:17:54,631 --> 00:17:55,464
he's saying is nonemotional and he's 
talking about the problems with how 

354
00:17:59,461 --> 00:18:00,294
these things are defined and one of the 
things is he brought up this DVD that 

355
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:07,490
one of the teachers of this course was 
making about how to.

356
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:08,383
How to make sure that you're not 
subconsciously biased or subconsciously 

357
00:18:13,741 --> 00:18:14,574
a prejudiced and the dvds were like 700 
bucks or something like that for a DVD 

358
00:18:21,031 --> 00:18:22,530
series.
Yeah.

359
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,480
Well this guy outlines all of this in 
his.

360
00:18:24,481 --> 00:18:26,460
In his video,
in this youtube video,

361
00:18:26,461 --> 00:18:28,910
and he's like,
this is craziness like gold.

362
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,630
This is that.
This doesn't make sense.

363
00:18:30,631 --> 00:18:31,464
It's never been proven to work.
Like in the idea that there's 

364
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:35,243
subconscious biases that you're accusing
someone of being guilty before you're 

365
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,270
ever even talking to them about 
something.

366
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,970
I get it like you don't even know.

367
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:51,990
Saying a subconscious bias is a very 
strange thing.

368
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:53,160
Like,
boy,

369
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:53,993
how do you know if you have that?
It's subconscious like you can't even 

370
00:18:57,331 --> 00:18:57,990
like you're,
you're,

371
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:59,850
you're making people think they're 
guilty.

372
00:18:59,851 --> 00:19:00,684
Even if they're not.
Like if you say you have a subconscious 

373
00:19:03,001 --> 00:19:03,834
bias,
that's one of the things that people do 

374
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,293
when they're super,
super liberal in order to prevent from 

375
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:11,400
other people think and they have a 
subconscious bias.

376
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:16,080
They go way out of their way to show no 
bias whatsoever and even favor something

377
00:19:16,081 --> 00:19:19,620
that people would be biased against.
Like there's super and a gay marriage.

378
00:19:19,621 --> 00:19:21,930
I love seeing gay couples.
It's amazing.

379
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,770
Do you love seeing heterosexual couples 
to like,

380
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,940
or do you just freak out over gay 
people?

381
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:28,530
Like what's going on?
You know,

382
00:19:28,531 --> 00:19:31,600
I like seeing people in love to,
but I really don't.

383
00:19:31,601 --> 00:19:34,050
You like seeing all of them.
I like seeing the whole batch.

384
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:34,840
It's nice.

385
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,690
It's very exhausting nowadays.
Like April in love,

386
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:39,970
just everything.
Like the how you're supposed to act,

387
00:19:39,971 --> 00:19:41,650
what you're supposed to say.
Ridiculous.

388
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:44,560
There was a last night I was at this bar
and this,

389
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:48,830
I thought it was sitting next to a,
a taller woman and then she looked up,

390
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:51,730
she looked over and it was obviously a 
post,

391
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:52,983
you know,
like a transformation and a transgender 

392
00:19:55,511 --> 00:19:56,344
woman,
you fuck,

393
00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:00,490
you have to say the right word,
but you have to say the right word.

394
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:02,690
She transformed.
Uh,

395
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,760
anyways,
so,

396
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:06,320
but then the whole time she.
Right,

397
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,253
right.
She kept on looking at me as if that 

398
00:20:10,031 --> 00:20:10,864
person was way taller and so if it was a
guy it would be a big giant guy just 

399
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:19,300
staring at me.
So either way I feel I felt like freaked

400
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,260
out about it,
you know,

401
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:25,130
so I might not allowed to be freaked out
because she's a woman now that some guys

402
00:20:25,131 --> 00:20:26,020
staring at me.
Woman.

403
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,780
Yeah.
Well everyone's staring at you.

404
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,920
You're allowed to get freaked out over 
anyone staring at you.

405
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:31,843
I mean,
if a little kid was staring at you like 

406
00:20:33,201 --> 00:20:34,280
mad dog,
New News,

407
00:20:34,281 --> 00:20:34,760
10,
you're like,

408
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,050
oh my God,
am I have to fuck this?

409
00:20:36,051 --> 00:20:41,051
Ten year old up anybody staring at you?
It's not good.

410
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,010
I didn't know how to act as.
It was weird though.

411
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:46,200
Stand your ground.
You have ground.

412
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:49,300
Can you get your back up?
Get your particles up.

413
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:52,913
It's weird.
If you don't want to vote for Hillary 

414
00:20:54,991 --> 00:20:57,720
this election.
People kind of think that you hate women

415
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:59,480
essentially.
I don't know that it's

416
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,980
essentially just fools.
Just fools.

417
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:03,990
There's people that are.
What's the.

418
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,650
It's an obvious target,
right?

419
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:08,140
You don't vote for because you hate 
women.

420
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:08,974
You just.
You don't understand what a milestone 

421
00:21:09,821 --> 00:21:10,450
this is,
man.

422
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:12,190
You don't care because you don't fucking
care.

423
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:14,050
Okay?
You know what you're worried about,

424
00:21:14,051 --> 00:21:14,884
man.
You worried about going to the gym and 

425
00:21:15,461 --> 00:21:16,510
being a Bro.
Okay,

426
00:21:16,511 --> 00:21:19,300
so why don't you do that?
I want you to go to gym and be a bro and

427
00:21:19,301 --> 00:21:21,430
leave the fucking voting to people who 
care.

428
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:24,580
You know,
those super like aggro,

429
00:21:24,581 --> 00:21:25,414
progressive type people.
Like I remember I was in a bar once in 

430
00:21:30,161 --> 00:21:32,680
New York and I was having a conversation
with this,

431
00:21:32,681 --> 00:21:33,514
uh,
this girl who was a waitress and the 

432
00:21:35,531 --> 00:21:39,970
bartender got so aggro bro on me and it 
was a,

433
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:45,540
it was about the,
it was the Oj Simpson case where like Oj

434
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:50,740
Simpson had been accused of domestic 
violence before,

435
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,510
like before the murder.

436
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:53,763
It was something like that,
something along those lines and our 

437
00:21:57,281 --> 00:21:58,810
member,
all I asked was,

438
00:21:58,811 --> 00:21:59,980
I said,
that's interesting.

439
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:05,040
I said he was accused of being,
but he was acquitted and the,

440
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:08,940
and the guy just totally ego brought me 
in.

441
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:10,540
He goes,
listen man,

442
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:14,170
when a woman says that something 
happened,

443
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:16,570
it fucking happened.
Okay.

444
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:18,280
Until you know better.
It happened.

445
00:22:18,281 --> 00:22:19,114
Like,
but didn't you just say he was 

446
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:22,900
acquitted?
Like I think he probably murdered his ex

447
00:22:22,901 --> 00:22:23,734
wife and that dude.
But didn't you say that he was 

448
00:22:25,001 --> 00:22:26,470
acquitted?
Like you can't,

449
00:22:26,471 --> 00:22:29,500
like you can't,
you can't attack that in there.

450
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:30,573
If he was acquitted,
we don't really know what happened 

451
00:22:31,961 --> 00:22:32,794
unless you were there.
We know that a court of law found that 

452
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:38,440
he wasn't guilty of it.
Is that because he had a lot of money?

453
00:22:38,441 --> 00:22:39,220
Is it.
Did it.

454
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,053
Did he never go to trial for that?
Was it just something that somebody 

455
00:22:42,341 --> 00:22:44,410
accused him of dropping and then drop 
the charges?

456
00:22:44,411 --> 00:22:45,244
What was it?
But he didn't want to hear none of that 

457
00:22:47,351 --> 00:22:48,184
dude.
He wanted to come strong with the ECO 

458
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,580
bro.
He just puffed up.

459
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,013
I didn't even respond to them.
I remember going to look at this silly 

460
00:22:55,001 --> 00:22:56,200
fuck.
This is ridiculous.

461
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,550
He got so aggro with me.

462
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,433
Did you watch that make and made in 
America the ESPN 30 for 30 on the trial 

463
00:23:01,921 --> 00:23:03,900
yet?
No.

464
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:05,280
It's available on demand.
I'm.

465
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,890
They probably leave it up there for 
awhile.

466
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:08,340
It's still.
As far as I recall,

467
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,193
I looked it up.
It's the only place you can find that 

468
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:14,000
show.
The actual photos from the crime scene.

469
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:16,620
Photos of autopsy.
Photos of,

470
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,910
of Ab Nicole with like a slashing her 
throat can see Ron Goldman to.

471
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:23,280
They don't show up when they hear it on 
TV,

472
00:23:23,281 --> 00:23:25,110
so if you're watching it and you can try
to catch it there,

473
00:23:25,111 --> 00:23:26,400
because I tried to show it to my friend 
that,

474
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:27,570
uh,
the other day I was like,

475
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:28,081
wait,
wait,

476
00:23:28,081 --> 00:23:28,914
right here,
it's going to come up.

477
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,360
And then it didn't take the,
cut it out.

478
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:33,270
It's literally only on,
on demand if you want to see it.

479
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:34,840
Wow.
There's not,

480
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:35,723
you can't even find them online anymore.
I don't know how they kept it off the 

481
00:23:37,681 --> 00:23:38,514
web,
but it's amazing how some things can be 

482
00:23:41,221 --> 00:23:44,460
kept off the web pretty easy nowadays.
Like it's like,

483
00:23:44,461 --> 00:23:46,160
I forget what it was recently where

484
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:48,320
they did just the best job.
Oh,

485
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:51,770
those photos of uh,
the SNL girl.

486
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:53,580
Oh yeah.
And uh,

487
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,420
those were just gone,
like every link dead,

488
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,480
like there was not one place to find it.
It was really well done.

489
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:03,950
And it's weird.
How did you hear four chance closing?

490
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:04,680
Uh,
they're,

491
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:08,970
they're going bankrupt and it costs 
money to run for town a lot.

492
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:11,900
And the servers mostly lead must get 
mad.

493
00:24:11,901 --> 00:24:13,190
Mad.
Crazy traffic,

494
00:24:13,191 --> 00:24:14,024
right?
Yeah,

495
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,560
it's weird.
All our websites are dying.

496
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:21,620
Remember style project and always used 
to talk to that dude on the phone.

497
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:22,573
Jay Style even dig.
I don't think I've been a dig in so 

498
00:24:26,211 --> 00:24:27,320
long.
I don't even know if that's still

499
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,700
gigs there.
Yeah,

500
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:30,710
yeah.
I go to dig all the time.

501
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:32,570
Yeah,
you get crazy stories.

502
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:37,600
Dig is like one of the one stop shops of
getting interesting shit online.

503
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:38,901
For me,
I'm like,

504
00:24:38,901 --> 00:24:39,734
what the fuck is going on in the world?
I'll go to dig and dig will be about 

505
00:24:42,501 --> 00:24:46,110
some new scientific adventure next to 
you know,

506
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:51,220
some new fucking paleo logical fine next
to some new technological discovery next

507
00:24:52,461 --> 00:24:54,200
to Nino,
new cell phones,

508
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:55,034
new cars.
Like it's all kinds of crazy stories 

509
00:24:56,511 --> 00:24:57,344
come out.
It seems like when Kevin left I kind of 

510
00:24:58,881 --> 00:25:02,510
just stopped going.
I started using reddit more and Fark.

511
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:05,690
All those are great,
but to me it's a super easy one.

512
00:25:05,691 --> 00:25:07,310
Stop.
What's the weird shit?

513
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,470
You know?
And always like weird,

514
00:25:09,471 --> 00:25:10,760
interesting things.
They'll,

515
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:14,930
they'll aggregate these stories from all
these other different websites and stuff

516
00:25:14,931 --> 00:25:16,660
too.
It's a,

517
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,533
it's like it's easy to go to someone 
who's already done the collecting for 

518
00:25:19,971 --> 00:25:20,804
you,
you know,

519
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:21,660
like the,
I,

520
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:24,040
I believe in supporting collectors 
because I don't,

521
00:25:24,041 --> 00:25:25,430
I don't have the time to do that.

522
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:26,503
You're going out and finding all these 
cool stories about space and you're 

523
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:34,361
putting them up in one spot that's very 
valuable because it's like a Dj there,

524
00:25:35,211 --> 00:25:36,044
like a Dj for stories because they're 
not just covering any fucking story 

525
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:43,310
because if they covered any fucking 
story it would be boring as shit.

526
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:44,383
You know?
There's a lot of stories that are going 

527
00:25:44,961 --> 00:25:45,794
on.
They're just like,

528
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,760
oh,
that's not that good.

529
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,900
But they figured out like,
what's the juiciest shit?

530
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:51,790
Like what's the more interesting shit?
What's the,

531
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,700
this,
what's the debt?

532
00:25:52,701 --> 00:25:57,470
And they shuffle it all in together and 
you always can get something fascinating

533
00:25:57,471 --> 00:25:59,300
out of it.
It's very addictive man.

534
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,630
Like looking on the Internet for those 
stories,

535
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:06,500
like weird,
crazy fucking scientific discoveries and

536
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:09,920
it's,
it's very addictive.

537
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:11,083
I went deep jewelry that I just like 
when you get deep into a subject and 

538
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:15,560
then you start watching videos and start
learning more.

539
00:26:15,561 --> 00:26:18,230
And then if anyone asks happens to ask 
you that question,

540
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:18,681
you'd be like,
oh,

541
00:26:18,681 --> 00:26:19,730
I know everything.
Like I,

542
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:20,663
I went deep on toaster ovens.
So if you need any information with 

543
00:26:23,091 --> 00:26:23,924
toaster ovens,
I know all the recent news on toaster 

544
00:26:26,591 --> 00:26:27,424
ovens,
but I went so deep I just laid in bed 

545
00:26:28,491 --> 00:26:31,190
for two hours watching reviews of 
toaster ovens.

546
00:26:31,191 --> 00:26:33,380
And Dude,
you're the go to toaster oven guy.

547
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,500
Tell everybody do you have a toaster 
oven?

548
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,770
It's great.
They're great.

549
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,633
I've never had one.

550
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,090
You know what?
They're really good forman.

551
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:43,140
English muffins with like a tuna fish on
them.

552
00:26:43,141 --> 00:26:44,010
And a little cheese.

553
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,100
Why that bitch?
Damn.

554
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:48,960
He just made a face like he's disgusted.
How dare you?

555
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:49,950
Yeah.
Martin,

556
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:51,540
you can put a chicken in it,
but you know,

557
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:54,300
you don't believe in a tuna melt with 
the English muffin.

558
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:56,330
No.
You would need a tune them out.

559
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:59,780
Tune has got a stench to it that someone
doesn't need.

560
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,880
Post.
Someone doesn't meet you.

561
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:04,770
Like when you have fraud.
What is the fresh?

562
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:05,950
My,
my,

563
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:06,510
my,
my.

564
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:07,201
Yeah.
Yes.

565
00:27:07,201 --> 00:27:08,280
Yeah.
So like that.

566
00:27:08,281 --> 00:27:11,760
And I know it's different from what it 
starkist and a little pouch or whatever.

567
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:12,923
Obviously way different tuna.
But to me when it's out in the open and 

568
00:27:16,111 --> 00:27:20,120
someone who's just cooked it,
it just fills up the room with a fucking

569
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:22,950
stench.
That's why you have mustard and Mayo.

570
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:25,080
Hm?
I don't know how to describe it.

571
00:27:25,081 --> 00:27:27,560
Smells like the ocean.
Real weird.

572
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,210
Yeah.
That doesn't bother me.

573
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,073
No Shit though.
You don't want a bunch of weird shit 

574
00:27:34,201 --> 00:27:37,200
with your food guy.
Eddie Bravo has got an onion thing.

575
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:39,210
If he gets unused something he'll 
fucking throw up.

576
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,370
Really?
Yeah.

577
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:41,760
Hates onions.
Hates him.

578
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:45,370
Why?
Stepfather was a dick and his stepfather

579
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:49,240
used to make them eat.
So Vj and still to this day,

580
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:51,510
she's onions.
He wants to fucking throw up.

581
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:54,240
Wait.
Who wants being made to eat?

582
00:27:54,241 --> 00:27:55,740
So Vj,
vj is great.

583
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:57,360
Hey Man,
I wasn't there.

584
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:00,570
What the pot.
I don't know what went down,

585
00:28:00,571 --> 00:28:03,560
but that is my boy.
Yeah.

586
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,790
They just can't eat.
He can't eat any onions.

587
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:07,710
He like.
He,

588
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:10,830
if he gets on until fucking puke.
Tau is a.

589
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,530
She is Korean.
So she eats all this,

590
00:28:13,531 --> 00:28:15,110
fucked up Kimchi,
do.

591
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,880
She eats eyeballs,
she loves eating fish eyeballs.

592
00:28:17,881 --> 00:28:19,890
She'll just go up to a fish and pull up 
the eyeball and eat it.

593
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:21,010
I'm like,
what are you born?

594
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:25,800
And she had this like,
her mom is sick.

595
00:28:25,801 --> 00:28:30,801
So she went to go visit her mom and so 
she opens up this thing and she got.

596
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,341
She's like,
mom,

597
00:28:32,341 --> 00:28:33,174
I got you everything.
And it was like every thing that you 

598
00:28:35,401 --> 00:28:40,020
wouldn't want to eat like a pig,
you're a pig feet like cow noses.

599
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:43,760
Like it was just like a smorgasbord.
There was one,

600
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:46,440
not one thing that I would eat in,
in this whole tray.

601
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:51,650
And it was like a Delicatessen to Whoa,
where did the balloon?

602
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,690
That's Philippines.
They love that stuff.

603
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,990
We used to serve that on fear factor as 
a,

604
00:28:57,030 --> 00:29:01,560
like a hard thing to do.
And my Filipino friends because in pool,

605
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:05,190
like a lot of the best pool players in 
the world are Filipino.

606
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,173
So I played pool a lot.
I was always around Filipino guys and 

607
00:29:08,131 --> 00:29:10,080
while I was doing fear factor,
I played a lot of pool.

608
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,150
This fucking dudes.
They were like,

609
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:14,340
I'll eat that shit tomorrow.
Like bring somebody.

610
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:16,650
Didn't you got any leftover?
They wanted to eat it.

611
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:17,573
I was like,
we made people eat that stuff is if you 

612
00:29:19,441 --> 00:29:23,370
don't know what we're talking about,
it's a fetus to duck fetus that's in.

613
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:27,450
It's like it's cooked in the yolk.
It's really kind of fucked up.

614
00:29:27,451 --> 00:29:29,430
It's kind of gruesome and it looks like 
a duck.

615
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,313
Like the picture.
I remember it looked like a baby duck 

616
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:33,690
that you'd just eat a baby duck.
Yeah.

617
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:38,500
I didn't know until I was like fucking 
39 years old or something.

618
00:29:38,501 --> 00:29:39,334
I mean,
I don't know how old I was when I found 

619
00:29:40,201 --> 00:29:41,990
out that uh,
of

620
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:47,200
a chicken egg doesn't become a chicken.
Like I never thought of it.

621
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:50,080
I never even thought of it.
Like,

622
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:52,300
of course it can't become a chicken.
That's just like,

623
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,460
I thought he had to describe them quick 
for the chicken,

624
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,900
eat them.
Don't get if you got them

625
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,100
early,
but if you sat on them then you're going

626
00:30:01,101 --> 00:30:01,934
to have to take care of that God damn 
chicken because it checks going to be 

627
00:30:03,851 --> 00:30:04,684
born.
And that's what I thought I felt you 

628
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:06,693
like you had to eat the eggs quick 
because they were just going to become 

629
00:30:09,281 --> 00:30:11,110
chickens.
Because in my mind,

630
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:12,023
and this is as a dopey child,
I felt like once something's out of the 

631
00:30:15,581 --> 00:30:17,950
body,
well it's obviously,

632
00:30:17,951 --> 00:30:19,180
it's just that's how they do it.
They,

633
00:30:19,181 --> 00:30:21,940
they lay their eggs and then the things 
come out of the eggs.

634
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:23,920
It's out of the body.
It must have given birth.

635
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:26,500
Like in my mind it has to be.
It's an egg.

636
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:28,690
It's in a shell.
It gave birth.

637
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:30,510
So I didn't understand that.
No,

638
00:30:30,511 --> 00:30:32,620
it has to be a fertilized egg.
Oh.

639
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:35,200
So what happens then within all that 
shit that's in the egg,

640
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:38,110
all that shit becomes a little.
A little bird.

641
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:39,183
But birds are such hose.
They're so goddamn prolific that they 

642
00:30:42,371 --> 00:30:43,204
drop an egg every day.
I know I might have birds that I have 

643
00:30:46,121 --> 00:30:48,400
chickens to drop an egg every day.
That means everyday they,

644
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,080
they want to be shitting out a baby.

645
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:51,643
As your cholesterol or anything gone up 
since he got these chickens is a 

646
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:58,670
gigantic myth.
Dietary cholesterol

647
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:02,540
strong according to the most recent 
science,

648
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:05,540
according to people that are way smarter
than me.

649
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,940
Okay.
And I know there's some disputes on this

650
00:31:07,941 --> 00:31:08,774
amongst people that are plant based,
people that believe that you can get 

651
00:31:12,681 --> 00:31:14,260
everything that you,
uh,

652
00:31:14,261 --> 00:31:17,550
you need from vegetables.
But um,

653
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:24,070
I think dietary cholesterol is less 
significant than sedentary lifestyle.

654
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:30,350
Less like genetics are a huge factor in 
having high cholesterol.

655
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:35,270
And then there's also,
I've come to learn about ldl cholesterol

656
00:31:35,271 --> 00:31:36,104
and hdl cholesterol and that having a 
higher levels of each other can balance 

657
00:31:40,731 --> 00:31:41,564
each other out.
And it's not necessarily the level of 

658
00:31:44,361 --> 00:31:47,810
cholesterol they're concerned with.
It's the type of cholesterol.

659
00:31:47,811 --> 00:31:50,000
So it's,
it's not food,

660
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,283
it's not like dietary cholesterol is 
actually important for developing 

661
00:31:54,351 --> 00:31:58,430
hormones.
It's actually an important factor in,

662
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:04,120
in your,
your body having the proper nutrients to

663
00:32:04,281 --> 00:32:05,114
rebuild itself.
Like dietary cholesterol is actually 

664
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:09,260
good for you.
We've been fucked.

665
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:10,573
We've been fucked.
We've been fucked by these food 

666
00:32:12,441 --> 00:32:13,274
industries.
There was an article today from Arab 

667
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:15,923
Technica and how do you say that?
Ars Technica where they were talking 

668
00:32:19,041 --> 00:32:21,680
about the sugar industry,
the Soda Industry,

669
00:32:21,681 --> 00:32:26,570
paying off people to lie about the 
negative health effects of sugar,

670
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:29,090
of sugar in these sodas.

671
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:32,090
W when we forget this,
so this were created as a desert.

672
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,920
You're not supposed to drink it as a 
beverage.

673
00:32:33,921 --> 00:32:34,754
Really.
It's,

674
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:35,930
yeah,
it was supposed to be like,

675
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:37,003
oh,
after dinner maybe we can all split a 

676
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:40,040
coca cola.
Big Soda is

677
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,550
buying off health orgs to keep profits 
in Americans.

678
00:32:43,551 --> 00:32:48,551
Fat Top Producers Back 90 six national 
organizations defeated $29.

679
00:32:49,861 --> 00:32:51,980
Proposed regulations.
Whoa.

680
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:56,920
And now I switched to Arnold Palmer's a 
few years ago,

681
00:32:56,921 --> 00:32:59,080
an ice teas.
Rest in peace.

682
00:32:59,081 --> 00:33:00,340
Arnold Palmer.
But uh,

683
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:03,160
uh,
I don't know if that's better though,

684
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,930
because the sugar of the lemonade

685
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,040
probably not,
but it's,

686
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:07,650
it's prob half a glass.
Well,

687
00:33:07,651 --> 00:33:10,140
it depends on how much,
how many grams,

688
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,780
you know,
really you would think there's some,

689
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:15,470
there's a new soda that they sweetened 
with Stevia.

690
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,580
Wonder if it's any good.
It's gross.

691
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:20,880
I saw somebody was drinking it.
That's a very health conscious.

692
00:33:20,881 --> 00:33:22,980
The other day I looked at them drinking 
it.

693
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:24,610
I tried to.
What is it,

694
00:33:24,611 --> 00:33:25,444
the trader Joe's or the whole foods?
A Stevia Cola and it tastes like RC RC 

695
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:32,110
Cola.

696
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:34,060
Nate Diaz.
Nate Diaz was drinking it.

697
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:36,330
Nate had it on his.
Uh,

698
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:37,201
I think that.
Is it.

699
00:33:37,201 --> 00:33:40,480
This is it called Xavia.
Nate had it on his instagram page.

700
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,550
That's.
Look,

701
00:33:42,551 --> 00:33:44,560
I like Stevie and coughing.
I like it.

702
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:47,320
It's different than soda,
different than sugar,

703
00:33:47,321 --> 00:33:49,960
but at least I know it's not fucking 
man.

704
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:50,943
You know,
starbucks just finally got Stevia and 

705
00:33:53,021 --> 00:33:55,180
almond milk within the last month.
There he goes.

706
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:57,910
Yeah.
And you know,

707
00:33:57,911 --> 00:33:58,721
if,
you know nate,

708
00:33:58,721 --> 00:34:01,570
nate is super health conscious.
He eats real clean.

709
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:03,663
They,
uh,

710
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:07,660
once they really got deep into like 
triathlons and stuff like that,

711
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,370
that's when they really,
like.

712
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:13,090
Nick was the first one.
He really met a bunch of people that ate

713
00:34:13,091 --> 00:34:13,924
really clean,
all these racers and then you realize 

714
00:34:16,071 --> 00:34:17,110
like,
oh,

715
00:34:17,111 --> 00:34:18,460
okay,
like organic foods,

716
00:34:18,461 --> 00:34:19,630
way better for you.
Oh,

717
00:34:19,631 --> 00:34:19,981
there's,
oh,

718
00:34:19,981 --> 00:34:20,850
okay.
You know,

719
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:24,460
don't eat pastas and breads.
And then they,

720
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:27,790
I think he cut out everything except for
fish.

721
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:31,530
I think it was like no land animals he 
was doing for awhile.

722
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:36,220
But he might even be full vegan now and 
his brother's gone back and forth.

723
00:34:36,221 --> 00:34:39,730
Sometimes they take in fish and I know 
that they were eating eggs.

724
00:34:39,731 --> 00:34:41,500
Jake shields eat eggs,
you know,

725
00:34:41,501 --> 00:34:42,334
like a lot of those guys hanging out 
together and they have a real similar 

726
00:34:45,881 --> 00:34:48,340
diet.
But um,

727
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,740
the um,
those guys,

728
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:53,890
if they're drinking something like that,
like that cvs shit guarantee.

729
00:34:53,891 --> 00:34:56,950
It's not bad for you.
Steve is just not bad for you.

730
00:34:56,951 --> 00:34:57,370
Right?
Like,

731
00:34:57,370 --> 00:34:59,440
I've never seen any negative effects of 
Steve.

732
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,760
I thought there was that because I 
remember I was really big in the Stevia.

733
00:35:02,761 --> 00:35:05,820
And then there was an article that came 
out about something that I was like,

734
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:07,140
Yo,
I'm just going back to sugar.

735
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,033
I'm just sick of this.
My only sugar that I really take now is 

736
00:35:11,341 --> 00:35:12,174
like,
I get some sugar in my ice coffee 

737
00:35:13,231 --> 00:35:16,080
instead of putting sweeteners in there.
I just put it in your.

738
00:35:16,081 --> 00:35:17,910
So you get an unsweetened and dump it 
in.

739
00:35:17,911 --> 00:35:20,090
Yeah,
just a little bit man.

740
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:23,520
But I don't know how bad that is.
And I've cut down starbucks now.

741
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,560
I used to do it every day,
like one of these every day.

742
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:26,610
Now.
I did it like twice a week.

743
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:27,963
I think they're saying more and more 
that it's just not good unless it's in 

744
00:35:33,041 --> 00:35:38,041
the food naturally like sugar and when 
it's connected to all the fiber

745
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:43,350
and all the vitamins and nutrients in 
like an like an orange or something like

746
00:35:43,351 --> 00:35:44,040
that.
Like you know,

747
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:44,873
there's some juicy oranges that you get 
that are probably better than any 

748
00:35:47,251 --> 00:35:48,084
dessert you ever have,
but isn't there like a factor in 

749
00:35:51,481 --> 00:35:53,970
desserts that you know you're not 
supposed to be eating that shit.

750
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,473
They know the thing I missed the most 
and it's hard to get out here in 

751
00:35:59,411 --> 00:36:01,630
California or at least I,
unless you go to like a,

752
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:06,600
like a market or like a outdoor.
When those is a peach or,

753
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:09,730
or a nectarine or a plum.
That's actually nice.

754
00:36:09,731 --> 00:36:10,564
And were you in Ohio?
You would just bite these humongous 

755
00:36:13,181 --> 00:36:15,310
peaches and they just melt in your mouth
out here.

756
00:36:15,311 --> 00:36:17,250
They're like hard as a rock and then you
might,

757
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:20,320
you just have to kind of wait for them 
to get like mushy one day and go,

758
00:36:20,321 --> 00:36:21,330
okay,
now it's mushy.

759
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,350
Mushy is not the same as

760
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,590
catch them and season.
Yeah.

761
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:26,881
I think.
Look,

762
00:36:26,881 --> 00:36:27,714
it's dry as fuck out here.
I bet a lot of like fruit trees and 

763
00:36:30,451 --> 00:36:32,390
shit.
I mean we're good.

764
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,440
We're good for almonds,
man.

765
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:38,250
This is what California is good for.
Almonds.

766
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,790
Oh,
here's some shit I found out.

767
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:40,763
Okay.
When I was at the home ranch that to 

768
00:36:42,781 --> 00:36:46,290
hone ranch,
they have pistachio trees,

769
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:51,710
but they graphed the pistachio leaves 
and branches onto another sturdier tree,

770
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:55,200
like an avocado.
Cool.

771
00:36:55,320 --> 00:37:00,320
And so you've got like a pistachio tree 
growing out of an avocado tree.

772
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,490
That's awesome.
And the dude was telling me,

773
00:37:02,491 --> 00:37:03,420
I was like,
what?

774
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:06,480
They can do that.
Did you know they could do that?

775
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:07,603
I think they,
they do a lot of things like that in 

776
00:37:08,721 --> 00:37:10,170
farming nowadays.
Like

777
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:13,670
how did I not know that?
I mean I knew about grafting,

778
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,713
like limbs onto other plants,
but I would've thought it was the same 

779
00:37:17,871 --> 00:37:18,704
plant.
Like you would graft your tomato branch 

780
00:37:20,751 --> 00:37:23,960
onto another tomato.
What the fuck man?

781
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:24,823
How do they do that?

782
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,150
Uh,
it's kind of,

783
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:28,400
I don't know.
Again,

784
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:33,550
I would say they probably like a.
What is this Jamie hand drawn diagram?

785
00:37:35,271 --> 00:37:37,670
It looks like it says right here,
like figure one cut.

786
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,833
You know what this looks like whenever 
dudes get abducted by aliens and then 

787
00:37:41,601 --> 00:37:42,950
they come back.
What was it like?

788
00:37:42,951 --> 00:37:44,030
Well,
let me draw it for you.

789
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:47,250
This is the first one.
The first one I come to,

790
00:37:47,251 --> 00:37:49,230
I'm on the table.
The second one,

791
00:37:49,231 --> 00:37:50,070
the table said,
stop,

792
00:37:50,071 --> 00:37:50,371
stop,
stop,

793
00:37:50,371 --> 00:37:50,731
stop,
stop,

794
00:37:50,731 --> 00:37:51,450
go back.
Go back.

795
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:52,283
Well,
you're doing the second one that's 

796
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:54,173
stable,
starts to vibrate and then the alien 

797
00:37:56,071 --> 00:38:00,150
comes in from overhead and now all I 
could see was his head and the lights in

798
00:38:00,151 --> 00:38:04,500
the ceiling.
And then an examining machine came down,

799
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,620
see the Arrow down into exactly what it 
looks like.

800
00:38:07,621 --> 00:38:11,880
And then I became one with the galaxy.
See?

801
00:38:11,881 --> 00:38:16,410
There's the alien and then the galaxy.
He reaches the next level,

802
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:18,720
the next level of the game.
That's what I see.

803
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:22,310
I say Dick and a butthole and it's 
getting probed on that last one.

804
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,720
Uh,
I don't see a Dick if you.

805
00:38:24,721 --> 00:38:26,000
Dick looks like that.
Dr.

806
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:30,740
Doctor.
Quite sure with Dick it's a,

807
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:35,070
it looks like a nail.
That's a tea cup o' tea cut stem.

808
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,220
And then they're implanting.

809
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:38,550
It says a bud gets implanted in there.
Oh Wow.

810
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,560
Then the bud grows into out of the stem.
Wow.

811
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:43,320
That's crazy.
So they,

812
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,280
they implant the button there and then 
they cut it.

813
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:47,840
Is that what they're saying?
This is cutting the bud.

814
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:51,220
Just trying to do some other pictures 
where you could kind of see that.

815
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:53,640
But like this is a little more of a 
bizarre.

816
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,713
Is that man,
they make a tree grow inside another 

817
00:38:56,561 --> 00:38:57,394
tree.
I did not know that they can frank and 

818
00:38:59,111 --> 00:39:00,940
tree but I should've known.
Right.

819
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:03,970
Because it makes sense.
Did they,

820
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:04,833
did they uh,
talk about the drought and like how 

821
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:12,520
pistachios are supposedly going to 
double in price in the next year because

822
00:39:12,521 --> 00:39:13,354
we had such a drought this year and I 
guess pistachios are just about to go 

823
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:17,470
crazy.
Sky High.

824
00:39:17,471 --> 00:39:18,304
So by now I know that's a really good 
point and I know it's important for 

825
00:39:22,511 --> 00:39:27,511
agriculture in California,
but I want to go get it.

826
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:28,963
Cause smog.
Oh you fuck what if you buy a bag a day 

827
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:35,021
that's like,
dude,

828
00:39:35,021 --> 00:39:38,980
it's $2 more a day and pistachios,
I'm fucked.

829
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:39,903
It's also a good of how much.
What percentage of your fucking budget 

830
00:39:42,581 --> 00:39:47,581
goes to pistachios ever in your life?
Like if you had to even consume a moment

831
00:39:48,431 --> 00:39:51,130
of your time thinking about this as a 
possibility.

832
00:39:51,131 --> 00:39:52,960
Like what about the stock price is going
up.

833
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:54,303
Like I love it.
What's your favorite three things that 

834
00:39:57,071 --> 00:39:57,741
you buy?
Well,

835
00:39:57,741 --> 00:40:00,970
if I gave you an opportunity to give up 
pistachios for the rest of your life,

836
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:04,480
do you think you would struggle now?
Don't be no issue.

837
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,800
Go Mad.
Walnuts.

838
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:09,280
The Brazil nuts.
I'm interesting.

839
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,320
Complex flavors.
Yeah,

840
00:40:11,321 --> 00:40:13,690
I mean there'd be no problem.
You eat peanuts,

841
00:40:13,691 --> 00:40:16,180
you'd be like cashews.
I'm down with cashews.

842
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:18,950
Don't need.
Where do you buy walnuts?

843
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:22,180
Like full walnuts.
Like I tried to buy like walnuts,

844
00:40:22,181 --> 00:40:23,014
not like chopped up walnuts.
It's like I'm talking about the ones in 

845
00:40:25,031 --> 00:40:26,970
the shower.
You crack on with this stupid crackers.

846
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:28,570
Good question.
I guess the supermarket,

847
00:40:28,571 --> 00:40:29,710
right?
I looked.

848
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:31,930
They don't have walnuts.
Walnuts.

849
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:33,730
Nobody gives a fuck about Walmart's 
anymore.

850
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:39,180
People realize like mixed nuts.
Walnuts give me that almond motherfucker

851
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:40,480
to crack that.

852
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:43,630
Especially.
Yeah,

853
00:40:43,631 --> 00:40:46,120
like how many people buy nutcrackers 
these days?

854
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:50,650
If you're not cracking clause,
like lobster claws or crab claws.

855
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,680
Right?
You're not buying a fucking nut.

856
00:40:52,681 --> 00:40:54,520
Cracker was the last time he cracked a 
nut.

857
00:40:57,910 --> 00:41:00,670
Cracking any nuts.
I have a netcracker collection at home.

858
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:02,950
It's one of those things.
You just leave in Ohio.

859
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:10,260
Just like the dance one where you like 
to handle that?

860
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,233
Yeah,
those are real.

861
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,210
That's what people don't know.
Like the nutcracker.

862
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,320
When I was a kid,
I was always like,

863
00:41:14,321 --> 00:41:17,680
why they call it the nutcracker when 
it's just a bunch of wooden toys.

864
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:20,020
Like why is that the nutcracker?
And realized,

865
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:21,820
oh,
those are actual nutcrackers.

866
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,350
[inaudible] was,
boy,

867
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:26,660
we cracked on notes.
We didn't just go and buy Aum.

868
00:41:26,661 --> 00:41:31,661
Aum shilled and packaged by Mexicans.
I also had a box of wooden ducks.

869
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:33,883
Remember when that was a popular thing 
where you'd have like a stupid people 

870
00:41:35,961 --> 00:41:40,360
will when we were kids like,
here have a wooden fucking dumped.

871
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:43,130
You're too stupid to play with anything 
that moves you.

872
00:41:43,131 --> 00:41:47,000
Piece of shit.
Just take this fucking wouldn't duck and

873
00:41:47,001 --> 00:41:49,780
pretend it's real.
Yeah.

874
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:51,410
Have duck fights.
I don't give a shit.

875
00:41:51,411 --> 00:41:55,610
I'm over here starving to death and 
there was duck.

876
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:57,560
There was something that was ultra 
realistic like that,

877
00:41:57,561 --> 00:41:58,394
the green head and everything.
And then there was ones that we were 

878
00:41:59,331 --> 00:42:01,220
just all brown that weren't painted and 
stuff,

879
00:42:01,221 --> 00:42:04,250
but I have like 20 of them.
That's hilarious.

880
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:07,780
Did you got wooden ducks?
Oh,

881
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:08,653
the role or wants a baby?
Do you know what I'm talking about 

882
00:42:12,381 --> 00:42:14,080
though?
Was that a thing or is that just an arm?

883
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:14,983
Like a,
like a stupid redneck thing or 

884
00:42:17,091 --> 00:42:17,924
something?
I'm sure there's like wouldn't stupid 

885
00:42:19,941 --> 00:42:22,100
wooden toys it.
I remember when I was a boy,

886
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,600
she.
Here's the argument though,

887
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:24,643
is the argument that it gave us more 
room for creativity when we were kids 

888
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:32,450
because we're playing with these stupid 
toys that really didn't do much,

889
00:42:32,451 --> 00:42:33,284
so we had to do it all in our own head 
instead of being overwhelmed by a video 

890
00:42:36,891 --> 00:42:38,210
game.
You know what I'm saying?

891
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:39,130
That.
Yeah,

892
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:39,890
that's.
Oh,

893
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,030
that's a decoy,
bro.

894
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:44,390
That's actually like a,
a well done decoy.

895
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:47,660
Like what that is.
They use those when they hunt ducks,

896
00:42:47,661 --> 00:42:49,190
they put that shit in the water.

897
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,090
Well,
this had like a.

898
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:51,983
well maybe they did,
but this had like real feathers and 

899
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:54,143
yeah,
that misstep.

900
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,800
We.
You'd put it on your fireplace.

901
00:42:55,830 --> 00:42:56,360
Okay,
well,

902
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,940
so that's because people use them for 
decoration.

903
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:01,571
No,
no,

904
00:43:01,571 --> 00:43:03,130
no.
Some of them are beautiful.

905
00:43:03,370 --> 00:43:04,970
What they started out.
See,

906
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:06,093
when you call it a decoy,
it's just because it's the exact same 

907
00:43:09,101 --> 00:43:11,920
shape as a decoy might not ever see the 
water,

908
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:13,173
but what those were.
Originally it was people trying to make 

909
00:43:15,881 --> 00:43:16,714
ducks that looked exactly like a duck so
you could float it on the pond and the 

910
00:43:19,991 --> 00:43:21,260
ducks would fly over and go,
oh,

911
00:43:21,261 --> 00:43:23,380
these ducks are just hanging out here.
This is a cool spot.

912
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:26,410
And they land and you blast them.
I mean,

913
00:43:26,411 --> 00:43:27,244
that's a duck.
Dynasty is all about that as a show and 

914
00:43:29,381 --> 00:43:34,381
an empire built on duck slaughter,
trickery and fuckery.

915
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:35,913
That's what they should rename duck 
dynasty trickery and fuckery because 

916
00:43:38,921 --> 00:43:41,290
they're tricking those ducks and is 
blowing them out of the sky.

917
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:44,380
But um,
because people got really good at it,

918
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:46,960
they started doing as art.
Like some of them are just art,

919
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:51,430
like people like grandma type people 
have on their mantle piece.

920
00:43:51,431 --> 00:43:53,830
And I love this.
I love this.

921
00:43:53,831 --> 00:43:56,500
I Love What it represents to pee in a 
fall.

922
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:58,640
Yeah,
I got a lot of them if you want it.

923
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:03,470
No,
I'm not.

924
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:06,620
I'm not into that.
It's funny because my mom is like,

925
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,080
Brian,
I don't want.

926
00:44:08,130 --> 00:44:09,830
I want to throw away all this shit.
And I was like,

927
00:44:09,831 --> 00:44:11,000
mom,
you have a basement.

928
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:13,820
It's like,
why bother throwing it away?

929
00:44:13,821 --> 00:44:15,530
It's not,
you don't need more room,

930
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:16,393
you know,
it's like you barely even go in your 

931
00:44:17,151 --> 00:44:17,984
basement and she's just telling me all 
this shit that I have there that 

932
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:22,610
completely forgot.
Like I have a brand new laser,

933
00:44:22,611 --> 00:44:24,500
this player back home.
I have laser,

934
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:27,403
laser district.
Funny that some things get to a certain 

935
00:44:28,851 --> 00:44:30,680
point,
like if you hang onto that laser disc,

936
00:44:30,930 --> 00:44:31,763
maybe it'll be one day like that Tuba 
with a needle on it that you dropped 

937
00:44:34,641 --> 00:44:36,390
down on the records,
you know,

938
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:38,760
because that shit is dope now.
If you had one of those,

939
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:41,610
if you had one of those old school like 
19.

940
00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:43,440
Oh,
three Tuba things,

941
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:44,380
you know what I mean?
Yeah.

942
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:47,910
It's like it was non mechanical or 
electrical.

943
00:44:47,911 --> 00:44:48,744
You turn the handle.
I think so the record player with the 

944
00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:53,670
speaker shout.
Yeah,

945
00:44:53,671 --> 00:44:55,020
there was.
There was like a,

946
00:44:55,590 --> 00:44:56,423
like the needle was attached to like a 
thing that looked like a musical 

947
00:44:59,731 --> 00:45:00,511
instrument.
Right?

948
00:45:00,511 --> 00:45:01,760
Graph.
Yeah.

949
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:03,420
Phonograph.
It's called the phonograph.

950
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:04,363
Yeah.
Yeah.

951
00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:06,450
Is there a video of that thing?
For sure.

952
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:08,310
For sure.
That pull up a video of the thing.

953
00:45:08,311 --> 00:45:12,780
I haven't even thought of that thing.
And do you watch antique roadshow?

954
00:45:12,781 --> 00:45:14,100
I'll be like,
in 10 years.

955
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:15,140
No,
I,

956
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:16,543
I just,
I forgot those things were real at one 

957
00:45:17,611 --> 00:45:18,444
point in time.
It's like one of those things where you 

958
00:45:19,301 --> 00:45:21,780
go back to like the history of stuff and
you go,

959
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:24,480
oh yeah,
this is even showing.

960
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:25,080
Uh,
I,

961
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:26,640
I tried to tell you about this before.

962
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:30,120
This is what they used before.
A records that Edison cylinder,

963
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,650
right?
That's right.

964
00:45:31,651 --> 00:45:35,070
You did tell him about this Mrs.
just a metal like,

965
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:37,470
yeah,
it's like a kid's toy nowadays.

966
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:38,880
Yeah.
But God,

967
00:45:38,881 --> 00:45:41,850
that'd be so valuable if you had that in
your house.

968
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:44,970
Like if you had that in your mom's house
and you,

969
00:45:44,990 --> 00:45:45,823
you,
you've fished that out one day and be 

970
00:45:47,211 --> 00:45:48,300
like,
Holy Shit,

971
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:50,400
if it's an edison on it,
dude,

972
00:45:50,670 --> 00:45:54,060
that laser disk recorder.
As goofy as it seems now,

973
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:56,580
there's gonna come a time where it's not
goofy anymore.

974
00:45:56,860 --> 00:45:59,370
Right now it's going to make a comeback 
and be like watching.

975
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:02,160
We're going to make a comeback,
but it's going to be interesting.

976
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:03,840
It's going to be like,
Whoa,

977
00:46:03,841 --> 00:46:04,674
look at this fucking thing from 1999 
where they had these silver discs 

978
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:11,693
earlier this year,
July the last few car got made right 

979
00:46:14,370 --> 00:46:15,203
until they've started making them again 
because someone's going to realize that 

980
00:46:16,621 --> 00:46:19,080
can make a shitload of money,
but no weird.

981
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:22,350
About five years ago I bought a VCR just
because I was like,

982
00:46:22,351 --> 00:46:23,184
you know what this is,
this is on its way out and I have tons 

983
00:46:24,901 --> 00:46:28,830
of vhs tapes so I'm just going to buy 
$29 on Amazon.

984
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,530
So I bought one and it's so light 
nowadays.

985
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:34,470
The technology is so basic.
It's like you could just pick,

986
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:36,360
pick on like one finger easily,
you know?

987
00:46:36,361 --> 00:46:38,610
Yeah.
It's ridiculous how light it is.

988
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:39,593
It feels cheap.
The only one on Amazon now costs a 180 

989
00:46:41,941 --> 00:46:42,930
bucks.
Whoa.

990
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:45,120
Fuck you.
As a DVD player,

991
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:49,060
you got to get one of those both.
Yeah.

992
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:52,710
Well maybe it's telling you.
Is it the other one that dvr now?

993
00:46:53,170 --> 00:46:54,003
Just like what is the price?
What is a good price for like a vhs 

994
00:46:58,531 --> 00:47:00,180
player?
It used to be like 50,

995
00:47:00,181 --> 00:47:03,510
$60.
They got down to like 29 to $39,

996
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:05,980
but look at these companies that make 
them like,

997
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:10,440
who I've heard of that.
So,

998
00:47:10,441 --> 00:47:11,274
um,
did you hear about that thing that they 

999
00:47:12,691 --> 00:47:13,524
were doing?
I've been paying more attention to this 

1000
00:47:14,551 --> 00:47:15,384
now.
I'm trying to figure out what a lot of 

1001
00:47:16,531 --> 00:47:19,680
this was.
There was a story,

1002
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:21,030
um,
that uh,

1003
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:21,953
Eddie Bravo actually told them about it 
first were the Pentagon was making fake 

1004
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:29,650
al Qaeda videos and faked like isis 
videos.

1005
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:33,490
And um,
there was this documentary about this.

1006
00:47:33,491 --> 00:47:34,324
Um,
we're not a documentary but this video 

1007
00:47:35,771 --> 00:47:40,120
online about the company that was 
involved in making these things.

1008
00:47:40,710 --> 00:47:41,950
It's crazy,
dude.

1009
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:43,840
It's crazy story.
Come in for a meeting like,

1010
00:47:43,841 --> 00:47:46,210
who am I meeting with Kevin seat.
Okay,

1011
00:47:46,211 --> 00:47:47,710
you got the job,
you're going to Iraq.

1012
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:50,230
They fucking ship this guy off.
It's a really interesting,

1013
00:47:50,231 --> 00:47:51,064
like this guy talking about being 
recruited to create these propaganda 

1014
00:47:54,791 --> 00:47:58,180
films for the US government and what 
they were was seat.

1015
00:47:58,540 --> 00:47:59,470
Everybody goes,
oh my God,

1016
00:47:59,471 --> 00:48:00,850
the US government's line to us.
Yeah,

1017
00:48:00,851 --> 00:48:01,684
definitely not good to have these videos
that we think are al Qaeda but are 

1018
00:48:05,801 --> 00:48:06,634
actually CIA that are or whoever it is 
that's doing these things as propaganda 

1019
00:48:11,170 --> 00:48:12,003
from.
But what's interesting is what they did 

1020
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:15,700
with it.
So there's a,

1021
00:48:15,701 --> 00:48:18,180
there was a thing called realplayer.
You Remember Real player?

1022
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:19,013
Yeah.
Yeah.

1023
00:48:19,090 --> 00:48:22,030
They only streamed it through real 
player so people would go to it,

1024
00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:23,123
they would stream it and it would get 
their Ip and they would know where they 

1025
00:48:25,001 --> 00:48:25,834
were and so they would know where people
who were all grouping up in these like 

1026
00:48:32,950 --> 00:48:35,320
radical factions,
radical groups,

1027
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:36,513
and they would be able to isolate them 
to a certain extent because of that or 

1028
00:48:39,821 --> 00:48:42,550
at least isolate their location,
you know,

1029
00:48:42,551 --> 00:48:45,250
so,
but which is really interesting.

1030
00:48:45,251 --> 00:48:46,084
Right.
It's really interesting because that's 

1031
00:48:48,370 --> 00:48:49,203
another thing that someone was telling 
me and this I had never considered this 

1032
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:55,120
fucking who fucking said this.
I want to say it's on the message board,

1033
00:48:55,690 --> 00:48:59,500
but they were talking about all the 
different factions that were sort of put

1034
00:48:59,501 --> 00:49:00,334
together to become isis and that they 
weren't even really necessarily against 

1035
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:07,030
or together with each other.
You know,

1036
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:10,240
there was Boko Haram,
there's the Taliban,

1037
00:49:10,590 --> 00:49:12,430
al Qaeda,
there's ice,

1038
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:13,293
there's all these different people,
but they just sort of lump all these 

1039
00:49:16,061 --> 00:49:18,940
groups in together like we're fighting 
those fuckers everybody.

1040
00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:22,570
And we think of him as an organized 
group,

1041
00:49:22,690 --> 00:49:24,670
like they got together and said,
you know what,

1042
00:49:25,110 --> 00:49:25,943
we've got to get together and organize a
group and put together our powers and 

1043
00:49:28,721 --> 00:49:29,270
no,
they didn't.

1044
00:49:29,270 --> 00:49:32,000
They basically on each other sides,
like the whole,

1045
00:49:32,030 --> 00:49:32,863
the whole thing is like a,
just a giant group of people that don't 

1046
00:49:35,261 --> 00:49:40,261
like us foreign policy and we sort of 
call them whatever we want to call them.

1047
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:41,893
Some of them are isis and some of them 
are al Qaeda and some of them are 

1048
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:47,690
Taliban and some of them are what they 
used to be the Mujahideen.

1049
00:49:48,730 --> 00:49:49,600
It's crazy.

1050
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,680
Right.
Did you watch the debates?

1051
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:56,570
The funniest thing on twitter is the 
Hashtag Muslims reporting.

1052
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:58,460
Uh,
whatever trump says,

1053
00:49:58,461 --> 00:49:59,294
like the Muslims need to report things.
So there's a Hashtag of just Muslims 

1054
00:50:02,781 --> 00:50:05,040
reporting things.
Like it's.

1055
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:07,250
But it's all shit.
Like,

1056
00:50:07,430 --> 00:50:10,540
like a fart in a little poop came out 
and listened to recordings.

1057
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:12,060
You know,
God,

1058
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:15,110
it's hilarious.
Or so they just took over that Hashtag.

1059
00:50:15,170 --> 00:50:16,003
Yeah,
they actually made it because it is 

1060
00:50:17,661 --> 00:50:20,660
pretty ridiculous.
That's when he said that.

1061
00:50:20,810 --> 00:50:23,590
So now they're just taking advantage of 
it to make it funny and it's.

1062
00:50:23,591 --> 00:50:27,380
It's hilarious to Rio,
a Muslim report stuff.

1063
00:50:27,590 --> 00:50:28,423
Hashtag

1064
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:30,890
dude.
It doesn't even seem real.

1065
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:34,880
It really doesn't.
I'm watched the debate and I was like,

1066
00:50:34,881 --> 00:50:35,714
this is.
It's so strange to watch that this is 

1067
00:50:38,301 --> 00:50:39,134
their choice.
This is our choice of who gets to be 

1068
00:50:41,241 --> 00:50:42,720
president.
It's like,

1069
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:44,930
how did we.
What happened here?

1070
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:48,250
I got really freaked out when he was 
hovering over,

1071
00:50:48,310 --> 00:50:50,170
like,
I don't know what triggered something in

1072
00:50:50,171 --> 00:50:50,460
me,
but I said,

1073
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:50,780
get,
get,

1074
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:52,380
get,
get away from her later taught.

1075
00:50:53,710 --> 00:50:55,310
Big powerful man.
Yeah.

1076
00:50:55,710 --> 00:50:58,350
He's a big looming,
powerful,

1077
00:50:58,351 --> 00:51:01,020
successful,
rich man.

1078
00:51:01,170 --> 00:51:03,630
Scares off everybody,
you know,

1079
00:51:04,390 --> 00:51:06,550
I Kim hovering over her and that debate 
was just.

1080
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:09,940
The whole thing was bizarre.
It's really bizarre what

1081
00:51:10,470 --> 00:51:14,160
talking to people that watch the same 
program as you with completely different

1082
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:15,033
hockey,
like in fights with family members over 

1083
00:51:17,670 --> 00:51:18,780
and like,
did you not?

1084
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:22,440
What I watched,
I've been tuning the Fox News nonstop.

1085
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:23,333
That's all been watching.
It's so interesting to see how people 

1086
00:51:27,841 --> 00:51:30,300
just fucking form teams,
man,

1087
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:35,420
they just form teams.
They go right or they go left,

1088
00:51:36,270 --> 00:51:37,103
but they form a team and then they write
shit that doesn't necessarily make 

1089
00:51:40,951 --> 00:51:41,784
sense,
but it fits within the narrative of 

1090
00:51:43,621 --> 00:51:46,880
their team winning and they duke it out 
back and forth with each other.

1091
00:51:46,881 --> 00:51:47,714
There's a bunch of people that we're 
talking with big smiles about how great 

1092
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:54,750
trump came away from that debate.
He had one good line.

1093
00:51:55,110 --> 00:51:56,580
You'd be in jail.
Oh yeah,

1094
00:51:56,581 --> 00:51:57,570
that was a good line.
Yeah,

1095
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:01,230
because you'd be in jail.
That was a good line.

1096
00:52:01,290 --> 00:52:02,123
He got her there.
I mean that was a fucking nice quick 

1097
00:52:03,931 --> 00:52:05,160
one.
Got,

1098
00:52:05,161 --> 00:52:06,300
ain't got out.
Boom,

1099
00:52:06,301 --> 00:52:07,230
knockout,
blow.

1100
00:52:08,490 --> 00:52:10,530
But the debate itself,
man.

1101
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:13,430
And then when he kept on saying like,
Hey,

1102
00:52:13,431 --> 00:52:14,180
you know,
she's uh,

1103
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:16,520
she did her time interrupting while 
interrupting.

1104
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:19,790
He interrupted more and took more time 
to answer questions.

1105
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,420
It was like,
what road is,

1106
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:25,040
is he living in a strange guy?
Politics.

1107
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:26,480
I hate both of them,
but uh,

1108
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:29,940
it's really interesting seeing how 
grocery bill,

1109
00:52:29,990 --> 00:52:32,210
I feel bad for billy Bush.
Like I think,

1110
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:35,270
I think a lot's going to come out on him
now that he's under the microscope.

1111
00:52:35,350 --> 00:52:38,440
Let me ask you this.
Why does there have to be moderators?

1112
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:42,160
Wouldn't it be better to watch the two 
of them sit down and talk?

1113
00:52:43,330 --> 00:52:48,330
This is what I think.
Get Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.

1114
00:52:48,550 --> 00:52:51,370
Sit them in a room together across a 
nice table like this.

1115
00:52:51,610 --> 00:52:56,190
Put a camera on the bolt them and let,
let them have a conversation.

1116
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:57,790
Let's find out what they're really all 
about.

1117
00:52:58,590 --> 00:52:59,423
You know,
because everyone's doing their 

1118
00:53:00,731 --> 00:53:04,360
broadcasting to you.
Everyone's broadcasting to you,

1119
00:53:04,361 --> 00:53:06,070
including me right now,
which is very ironic,

1120
00:53:06,610 --> 00:53:07,600
but everyone,
that's what they're doing.

1121
00:53:07,630 --> 00:53:08,463
They're broadcasting,
but don't just think Donald Trump would 

1122
00:53:10,970 --> 00:53:13,750
overpower for her.
So she can't even talk as you will learn

1123
00:53:13,751 --> 00:53:15,170
a lot about him.
If he does that well,

1124
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:18,370
we'll learn a lot about him.
If he does that and I bet she'll be able

1125
00:53:18,371 --> 00:53:20,680
to manipulate that and make him look 
really bad.

1126
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:23,560
Look,
I think you get them together,

1127
00:53:23,561 --> 00:53:26,300
the moderators asking him to answer 
questions,

1128
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:28,620
telling her the time is up and all this 
different jazz.

1129
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:32,340
That's an added element.
Why am I not talking to her?

1130
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:33,391
Okay.
I'm not.

1131
00:53:33,391 --> 00:53:34,060
I can't.
Well,

1132
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:35,010
I'm not there.
Okay.

1133
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:36,390
Well,
why doesn't he talk to her?

1134
00:53:36,391 --> 00:53:38,580
Let's find out what they think about 
each other.

1135
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:39,810
Let's let,
let them.

1136
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:40,733
Why I'm.
Why are you going to do it better than 

1137
00:53:41,491 --> 00:53:42,330
me?
Tell me.

1138
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:44,613
You know,
why does it have to be fucking bitter 

1139
00:53:46,731 --> 00:53:51,530
dire enemies every time to people are 
running for the same position kit.

1140
00:53:51,531 --> 00:53:53,930
They've recognized that without 
competition,

1141
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:55,033
you know,
this is allegedly not the best we can 

1142
00:53:57,021 --> 00:53:57,854
do.
Right?

1143
00:53:58,170 --> 00:53:59,270
I think most people think,
well,

1144
00:53:59,271 --> 00:54:00,104
we probably could find a few scientists 
or doctors or whatever that might do a 

1145
00:54:02,541 --> 00:54:04,250
better job in those two.
Running the country,

1146
00:54:04,251 --> 00:54:06,530
but whatever.
Just put that aside.

1147
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:11,270
It's not the best.
Do you think is the best?

1148
00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:12,973
There's no way,
right?

1149
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:13,873
No Way.

1150
00:54:16,550 --> 00:54:17,383
Why don't

1151
00:54:18,290 --> 00:54:21,080
just doesn't seem real.
Even discussing it.

1152
00:54:21,081 --> 00:54:22,690
I like lose my train of thought because 
I'm like,

1153
00:54:22,691 --> 00:54:25,160
I can't believe we're actually sitting 
here talking about this,

1154
00:54:27,970 --> 00:54:29,350
but whatever people do,
man,

1155
00:54:29,590 --> 00:54:34,590
they get on a team and they fucking wave
that flag and it's the team of the right

1156
00:54:35,011 --> 00:54:35,844
of the team of the left is a few people 
that sort of dangling between the 

1157
00:54:38,021 --> 00:54:38,854
middles,
so like if you had big giant piles of 

1158
00:54:40,511 --> 00:54:41,344
ants and then there was like a little 
trail in between those piles of ants 

1159
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:48,250
that was like kinda thinned out and then
the,

1160
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:49,113
the pile would be on the lefthand side 
and the pile of being the right hand 

1161
00:54:51,431 --> 00:54:52,264
side.
There's a few people that are in the 

1162
00:54:53,291 --> 00:54:54,124
middle.
There's a few people that are walking 

1163
00:54:54,971 --> 00:54:57,490
back and forth in the middle.
They don't know which way to go,

1164
00:54:58,090 --> 00:55:02,080
but the vast majority,
they kill a fucking pile and they decide

1165
00:55:02,081 --> 00:55:04,480
fucking circular movement or they,
you know,

1166
00:55:04,481 --> 00:55:07,720
they decide whatever it is,
whatever they decide,

1167
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:08,830
you know,
fourth amendment,

1168
00:55:09,490 --> 00:55:10,840
you know,
freedom of speech,

1169
00:55:10,990 --> 00:55:12,550
whatever it is they ride with.

1170
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:15,270
Yep.
It's like apple,

1171
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:17,070
pc,
Samsung,

1172
00:55:17,910 --> 00:55:21,090
like is that whole thing?
Just gender rights.

1173
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,640
What do you think the chances this 
happens again in 20,

1174
00:55:23,641 --> 00:55:24,474
20 are the same.
I don't know if she wins a big Kanye 

1175
00:55:27,901 --> 00:55:30,000
versus trump in 2020.
It's going to be worse.

1176
00:55:30,030 --> 00:55:33,540
It's not getting better cognac when you 
could.

1177
00:55:33,541 --> 00:55:35,700
When I can't take it.
He could win.

1178
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:40,980
I can you imagine having years of Kanye 
like trump shit.

1179
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:42,870
Trump.
Eight years in a row.

1180
00:55:43,010 --> 00:55:44,460
All right.
I would throw my tv out.

1181
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:46,980
Could have a new election every year.
You keep winning.

1182
00:55:51,790 --> 00:55:54,000
Just so people could say president 
Kanye.

1183
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:56,260
Hey Man.
Is it that bad?

1184
00:55:56,890 --> 00:55:58,090
I mean,
what do we,

1185
00:55:58,091 --> 00:55:59,440
what are we getting into right now?

1186
00:56:01,130 --> 00:56:04,720
This is bananas.
It doesn't seem right.

1187
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:07,580
Real.
I mean I really am feeling more and more

1188
00:56:07,581 --> 00:56:08,414
everyday like we're living in a 
simulation and the simulation is 

1189
00:56:11,841 --> 00:56:14,420
revealing itself to us.
A hundred percent.

1190
00:56:14,450 --> 00:56:16,370
A guy named wiener can't stop showing 
his dick.

1191
00:56:16,430 --> 00:56:18,270
Really?
How you obviously

1192
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:19,330
this guy.
Damn script.

1193
00:56:19,590 --> 00:56:22,130
One hundred percent was writing this.
The,

1194
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:26,230
it's Eddie Bravo.
It's like a 1990 [inaudible] Sitcom.

1195
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,710
Eddie Bravo isn't.
They had a trolling us.

1196
00:56:28,810 --> 00:56:32,920
Corey Feldman back on the today show 
dressed all in gold.

1197
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:33,833
Yeah,
I did another crazy performance called 

1198
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:39,120
America and then he accidentally threw a
flag on the ground.

1199
00:56:39,330 --> 00:56:43,290
Corey Feldman looses his damn mind again
with another today.

1200
00:56:43,291 --> 00:56:43,981
Performance.
Well,

1201
00:56:43,981 --> 00:56:45,840
hey man.
That's how he staying relevant.

1202
00:56:45,990 --> 00:56:48,600
He banned me off twitter after I talked 
about him.

1203
00:56:48,601 --> 00:56:51,310
Last time we talked about him on here.
Blocked you.

1204
00:56:51,311 --> 00:56:53,010
You blocked me.
Did he block you?

1205
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:56,850
I don't know Corey Feldman's twitter 
page ever,

1206
00:56:57,750 --> 00:56:59,280
ever,
but I'm sure he's a good guy.

1207
00:56:59,430 --> 00:57:00,430
I don't.
This one.

1208
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:02,550
I'm not giving him out here.
That's what I'm saying.

1209
00:57:03,030 --> 00:57:06,420
Saying he's just being super outrageous 
in order to get attention.

1210
00:57:06,421 --> 00:57:08,910
It's smart because otherwise they're not
going to pay attention.

1211
00:57:09,390 --> 00:57:13,410
It's fucking hard for a guy that's been 
in movies and had a lot of shit going on

1212
00:57:13,411 --> 00:57:16,620
that it all kind of goes away and he's 
just trying to do it himself.

1213
00:57:16,621 --> 00:57:21,000
He's trying to figure out some way,
some way to stay in entertainer.

1214
00:57:21,150 --> 00:57:22,590
I get it.
Nothing wrong with it.

1215
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:24,840
It's weird.
It's doing weird stuff,

1216
00:57:24,990 --> 00:57:25,920
but I,
I get.

1217
00:57:25,921 --> 00:57:26,754
I mean look,
we're talking about him because he's 

1218
00:57:27,451 --> 00:57:29,970
doing weird stuff.
He does questionable things though,

1219
00:57:30,390 --> 00:57:32,190
that it's on purpose.
Weird,

1220
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:35,490
but think he's just a weird dude and 
that's kind of art he likes to make.

1221
00:57:36,170 --> 00:57:41,170
I mean the whole feldman angel thing 
really is gross and creepy and awful,

1222
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:45,260
so I think he's just talented and he 
thinks he is talented.

1223
00:57:45,490 --> 00:57:47,400
Like he's in denial.

1224
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:54,420
Could be a grand Andy Kaufman 
requirements could be.

1225
00:57:54,421 --> 00:57:55,254
But if you've watched any ethic,
magnitudes the album cover for his 

1226
00:57:58,140 --> 00:58:01,070
double disc that he's releasing and 
Jello to the core.

1227
00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:04,830
He hates rock on Corey Feldman on you.
Dude,

1228
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:06,233
I'm not hating on you.
They are racer tool around some fun 

1229
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:09,930
crop.
That's what he likes,

1230
00:58:09,931 --> 00:58:12,720
man.
He's at a party.

1231
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:14,333
He uh,
he know he sells like $20 videos or 

1232
00:58:17,011 --> 00:58:18,540
something like that.
If you pay him,

1233
00:58:18,541 --> 00:58:20,220
pay him 20 bucks,
he'll be like,

1234
00:58:20,340 --> 00:58:21,173
he'll read something for you.
And he does it in characters like when 

1235
00:58:24,001 --> 00:58:26,700
he was in lost boys who has the same 
jacket on and stuff like that.

1236
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:30,210
So Larry,
forget what's comic.

1237
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:31,193
Uh,
there's one of our buddies just spends 

1238
00:58:32,581 --> 00:58:34,990
like 20 bucks a week just getting a new 
video.

1239
00:58:37,470 --> 00:58:38,303
Well that's,
that's probably a smart way to make 

1240
00:58:39,721 --> 00:58:40,554
money.
I bet he can turn out fucking dozens of 

1241
00:58:42,541 --> 00:58:44,520
those an hour.
Yeah,

1242
00:58:44,930 --> 00:58:47,010
if he's just doing that.

1243
00:58:47,350 --> 00:58:49,480
That just reminded me of the story I've 
been hearing recently.

1244
00:58:49,490 --> 00:58:52,360
You know all the comic con convention is
others,

1245
00:58:52,420 --> 00:58:53,171
not just one.
Now.

1246
00:58:53,171 --> 00:58:54,004
There are multiple.
They're all over the country and they 

1247
00:58:55,721 --> 00:58:59,440
have a old TV stars come in to beyond 
them.

1248
00:59:00,130 --> 00:59:00,963
They're making.
When I heard hundreds of thousands of 

1249
00:59:03,461 --> 00:59:08,461
dollars per convention leaving with cash
and bags because they're.

1250
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:12,700
It's 20 bucks.
It's at least 20 bucks a photo if not 40

1251
00:59:12,701 --> 00:59:13,534
or 50 or 80.
If you're signing them and it's a deal 

1252
00:59:15,911 --> 00:59:16,744
they're making with the photographer 
that's taken the photo and the 

1253
00:59:18,341 --> 00:59:19,174
convention and then the person who's who
of the actual star gets the rest of it 

1254
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:26,010
and they're making a lot of money,
like really old people making.

1255
00:59:26,250 --> 00:59:27,083
I forget it.

1256
00:59:27,770 --> 00:59:28,603
I can give you an example.
I've said this before on the podcast 

1257
00:59:30,751 --> 00:59:31,584
when I saw daisy duke,
the girl that played daisy duke and I a 

1258
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:37,650
comic convention and she was just 
sitting there and Catherine Bach?

1259
00:59:37,690 --> 00:59:39,060
Yeah.
She was just sitting there by herself.

1260
00:59:39,061 --> 00:59:41,970
No one knew who knew who she was just 
sitting there and then I'm like,

1261
00:59:41,971 --> 00:59:43,980
Holy Shit,
daisy dukes to sitting there.

1262
00:59:44,190 --> 00:59:45,180
And so I came up and said,
oh,

1263
00:59:45,181 --> 00:59:46,380
can I get a picture?
And she's like,

1264
00:59:46,381 --> 00:59:47,214
sure it's going to be 20 bucks.
And sounded like she was just making 

1265
00:59:48,961 --> 00:59:50,460
money.
Like I had to use my own camera,

1266
00:59:50,730 --> 00:59:53,580
but she was charging 20 bucks for to 
take a picture with her.

1267
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:55,350
Yeah.
So it was pretty sad.

1268
00:59:55,710 --> 00:59:59,220
Uh,
I just saw that a fucking weird man.

1269
00:59:59,221 --> 01:00:01,020
That's a weird practice,
right?

1270
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:02,610
It is,
it's gross.

1271
01:00:02,670 --> 01:00:07,320
The guy played thor is going to wander 
around a little over $350,000

1272
01:00:07,321 --> 01:00:08,154
in a weekend.
Robert Downey jr would make about a one 

1273
01:00:10,231 --> 01:00:12,300
point 5 million for his appearance at 
comicon.

1274
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:13,733
And then it goes down to say how much 
like a autograph from John [inaudible] 

1275
01:00:17,140 --> 01:00:19,820
Jack was like 70 bucks.
But if he's,

1276
01:00:19,870 --> 01:00:20,910
he's probably not there.

1277
01:00:21,270 --> 01:00:25,320
So wait a minute.
So these guys go there and take pictures

1278
01:00:25,321 --> 01:00:26,220
with people for money.

1279
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:27,133
Yeah.
Ralph Macho cost 40 bucks for a photo 

1280
01:00:30,401 --> 01:00:33,260
op.
But his costars

1281
01:00:33,550 --> 01:00:35,550
honestly the ones you were saying in the
millions.

1282
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:37,800
So Robert Downey Jr.
Yeah.

1283
01:00:38,350 --> 01:00:41,040
It takes pictures of peoples from 
probablY not doing that,

1284
01:00:41,041 --> 01:00:44,480
but that's for him to show up at just at
the event to other people.

1285
01:00:45,390 --> 01:00:49,710
So just to get them to show up and be in
the main hall to say like,

1286
01:00:49,711 --> 01:00:51,240
hey,
here's the new avengers trailer.

1287
01:00:51,270 --> 01:00:53,880
Oh my goodness.
That's Insane how ballers.

1288
01:00:53,881 --> 01:00:58,260
that guy.
That's insane.

1289
01:00:58,261 --> 01:00:59,460
That's a lot of money,
man.

1290
01:00:59,650 --> 01:01:01,380
God damn.
Just to show up.

1291
01:01:01,381 --> 01:01:02,214
Hey dude,
just come to my thing and I'll give you 

1292
01:01:03,301 --> 01:01:04,740
a million bucks.
That's awesome.

1293
01:01:04,770 --> 01:01:06,630
Okay.
But I'm only talking a couple of lines.

1294
01:01:06,810 --> 01:01:07,470
Okay,
good,

1295
01:01:07,470 --> 01:01:08,180
good,
good.

1296
01:01:08,180 --> 01:01:09,013
It's cool.
Just smile costs like 200 bucks for a 

1297
01:01:10,891 --> 01:01:12,550
ticket for the weekend.
Just to go to comic con.

1298
01:01:13,230 --> 01:01:14,063
Just to hang out with everyone.
I mean that's pretty much what paris 

1299
01:01:15,811 --> 01:01:16,644
hilton does nowadays.
She just makes appearances and get some 

1300
01:01:18,970 --> 01:01:19,980
shitloads of cash.

1301
01:01:20,070 --> 01:01:22,800
Buys new puppies for $10,000.
Yeah.

1302
01:01:22,801 --> 01:01:24,120
Appearances are big,
right?

1303
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:28,140
It's like the way people who don't have 
an act perform to show up.

1304
01:01:28,530 --> 01:01:33,530
I'm here like just being there is your 
performance now and now she's a dj.

1305
01:01:33,570 --> 01:01:34,403
She literally just presses play and just
wave their arms around for like an hour 

1306
01:01:37,831 --> 01:01:38,910
and that's it.
It's good.

1307
01:01:39,090 --> 01:01:42,630
It's probably have someone else do it 
for like someone else.

1308
01:01:42,631 --> 01:01:45,240
Can cox the music or does she cocked her
own music?

1309
01:01:45,330 --> 01:01:46,163
She just gets a cd and she presses play 
and turns knobs here and there to make 

1310
01:01:50,791 --> 01:01:53,010
it look like she's doing some typical dj
stuff nowadays.

1311
01:01:54,150 --> 01:01:56,850
Russell peters would get angry.
he doesn't call that dj and.

1312
01:01:57,030 --> 01:01:57,680
Oh yeah,
I know.

1313
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:58,513
You know russell gets furious.
I've heard some of the bigger dj's that 

1314
01:02:02,131 --> 01:02:02,964
are making money in vegas.
They have to fees for an event like 

1315
01:02:04,831 --> 01:02:06,570
that.
They have a press play fee and then they

1316
01:02:06,571 --> 01:02:09,270
have an actual like outperforming mixed 
songs fee.

1317
01:02:09,390 --> 01:02:10,560
Oh,
that makes sense.

1318
01:02:10,570 --> 01:02:11,850
That's really expensive.
That makes sense.

1319
01:02:11,870 --> 01:02:12,703
I to do that,
a comedy show have one fee where I just 

1320
01:02:15,151 --> 01:02:18,960
stand there in front of a tape recorder 
and I go like this while my jokes play,

1321
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:23,693
I pause.
I do my whole act like they got another 

1322
01:02:25,171 --> 01:02:26,990
fever.
I actually do the stand up.

1323
01:02:27,570 --> 01:02:28,403
That's cool.

1324
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:34,360
Have you ever ate one of the hottest 
peppers in the rural members?

1325
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:36,080
would you ever eat one of those peppers?

1326
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:39,390
Um,
I'd probably try it just to see what the

1327
01:02:39,391 --> 01:02:41,460
fuss is all about.
I mean I've had some,

1328
01:02:41,461 --> 01:02:42,294
um,
there was a piece to be a place in 

1329
01:02:43,950 --> 01:02:44,783
encino called chili,
my soul and it was just like super 

1330
01:02:47,611 --> 01:02:52,350
awesome fucking chili place that had 
like the most legit chili,

1331
01:02:52,590 --> 01:02:55,740
like they had mild chili where it didn't
fuck with you at all.

1332
01:02:55,741 --> 01:03:00,420
But then at the top end of the scale 
they had like some himalayan death shit.

1333
01:03:00,690 --> 01:03:01,523
They had some chili that you couldn't 
even fucking believe a person can eat 

1334
01:03:04,171 --> 01:03:05,670
it.
And I never even tried 10.

1335
01:03:05,970 --> 01:03:07,920
They have a 10.
Apparently they had a 10,

1336
01:03:08,130 --> 01:03:11,760
but I did try a nine once and I,
they give you,

1337
01:03:11,820 --> 01:03:14,880
this is how strong the chileans they 
give it to you in like a thimble and I'm

1338
01:03:14,881 --> 01:03:15,714
not fucking joking.
It'S like a little tiny cup that you 

1339
01:03:18,091 --> 01:03:20,370
would get ketchup at,
at a shitty diner.

1340
01:03:20,590 --> 01:03:22,710
Those little tiny ones.
That's what they give you.

1341
01:03:22,711 --> 01:03:26,580
The chili.
And I put it in my mouth and immediately

1342
01:03:26,581 --> 01:03:30,540
start hiccuping.
My body's like freaking out.

1343
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:35,600
Tears are pouring down my face,
my snots porn out of my nose.

1344
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:38,130
And that was like a tiny little bite of 
this stuff.

1345
01:03:38,131 --> 01:03:39,780
I was like,
what the fuck?

1346
01:03:39,781 --> 01:03:41,400
My whole tongue was numb.
I was like,

1347
01:03:41,401 --> 01:03:42,234
whoa.

1348
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:43,073
Youtube videos of like ghost peppers,
I highly recommend is sitting there and 

1349
01:03:45,601 --> 01:03:46,434
watching this.
One of my favorite shows is called hot 

1350
01:03:48,541 --> 01:03:49,670
ones.
I want to like,

1351
01:03:49,830 --> 01:03:50,663
I wanted to do this show so bad.
I don't know if you've seen it where 

1352
01:03:53,010 --> 01:03:58,010
this guy answered 10 questions and each 
one you start off at like,

1353
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:00,780
like tap eto.
Then it gets hotter,

1354
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:03,690
each chicken wings.
So each one you take a bite of a chicken

1355
01:04:03,691 --> 01:04:04,524
wing and then he will ask you a question
and it starts off to see how if you 

1356
01:04:08,071 --> 01:04:10,650
could get all the way to the end in the 
end it's like the hottest one.

1357
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:13,980
So it's really interesting to see who 
can do it and who can't.

1358
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:17,310
And it's genetic.
I don't know,

1359
01:04:17,311 --> 01:04:22,311
like a tommy chung did it and he did it,
but I think there were some shenanigans,

1360
01:04:22,321 --> 01:04:25,020
but uh,
the first three he was like,

1361
01:04:25,050 --> 01:04:27,330
even the tapteal when it goes well or 
this is hot and he's like,

1362
01:04:27,331 --> 01:04:28,680
whatever.
But then he gets to the end.

1363
01:04:28,681 --> 01:04:33,681
He wasn't breaking a sweat where other 
people are like gagging on the japanese,

1364
01:04:33,931 --> 01:04:36,480
whatever you want,
couldn't handle that hot shit.

1365
01:04:36,481 --> 01:04:37,314
He went for it first and like almost 
started barfing heat the hot one first 

1366
01:04:39,961 --> 01:04:42,220
and then he touched his dick with it 
instead.

1367
01:04:42,980 --> 01:04:43,800
It was,
you got broke.

1368
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:45,630
Chrysler did one of my favorite 
episodes.

1369
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:49,820
A shout out to hot ones.
So jamie just pulled this up while we're

1370
01:04:49,830 --> 01:04:50,663
talking.

1371
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:53,850
This guy does a bong rip with the 
carolina reaper.

1372
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:54,953
Carolina reapers.
Apparently the top of the food chain 

1373
01:04:56,761 --> 01:04:58,400
when it comes to the hot peppers.
One of them.

1374
01:04:58,401 --> 01:05:00,570
Yeah.
That's they say is the hottest.

1375
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:02,940
Is it?
I thought it was that other one,

1376
01:05:02,941 --> 01:05:05,160
but I think I read recently.
Yeah.

1377
01:05:05,510 --> 01:05:06,343
I thought.
I think I read recently the carolina 

1378
01:05:07,441 --> 01:05:08,400
reaper is the hottest.

1379
01:05:08,490 --> 01:05:10,470
See,
I want to know what would that really do

1380
01:05:10,471 --> 01:05:11,580
anything though.
You're,

1381
01:05:11,610 --> 01:05:12,990
you're burning it,
you know,

1382
01:05:12,991 --> 01:05:15,990
I don't know if that would actually.
This might be a fucking bullshit.

1383
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:17,033
Until.

1384
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:19,950
What was it doing?
Just a ghetto.

1385
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:22,600
Exactly what happens to me second after 
he takes the hit.

1386
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:24,153
It's like three minutes of him coughing.
It's not search flying out of his nose 

1387
01:05:26,741 --> 01:05:27,221
and.
Oh,

1388
01:05:27,221 --> 01:05:28,870
let's watch.
Oh shit.

1389
01:05:32,230 --> 01:05:36,690
I have something better to do.
Go full screen.

1390
01:05:36,691 --> 01:05:41,691
Please don't let anybody see it.
So this guy's got the carolina reaper.

1391
01:05:43,290 --> 01:05:44,123
Here's if you want to watch online.
Ted barris bong rips the carolina 

1392
01:05:47,731 --> 01:05:49,350
reaper.
And then uh,

1393
01:05:49,450 --> 01:05:54,450
ask derek puke warning original video.
Here we go.

1394
01:05:54,741 --> 01:05:57,660
So this guy's just telling you to 
fucking take a carolina reaper.

1395
01:05:57,960 --> 01:05:58,793
Oh,
jesus.

1396
01:05:59,970 --> 01:06:02,010
OH my goodness.
I don't think I would do anything.

1397
01:06:02,870 --> 01:06:04,240
Let's try it.
Fuck that.

1398
01:06:04,250 --> 01:06:07,950
It's no professional though.
Comes to bong.

1399
01:06:07,951 --> 01:06:11,590
Rips a bud tender.
So tender.

1400
01:06:11,830 --> 01:06:16,220
I don't say that again.
Bong rip and bud tender.

1401
01:06:16,250 --> 01:06:18,480
Come on.
Is that what they're calling them now?

1402
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:23,400
That's like the barista at starbucks.
I have issues with that.

1403
01:06:23,430 --> 01:06:26,610
It's like the guy at the restaurant that
wants to get really fancy with the wines

1404
01:06:26,611 --> 01:06:27,444
and explained to you the way that wants 
to get really crazy and tell you what 

1405
01:06:31,201 --> 01:06:34,030
part of the world it's growing in,
why the grapes are so important there.

1406
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,260
I'm a bud tender will.
Okay.

1407
01:06:37,261 --> 01:06:39,180
This is going to give you that stony 
high.

1408
01:06:39,390 --> 01:06:43,260
The most important thing here is no more
than three heads do.

1409
01:06:43,270 --> 01:06:45,960
Trust me.
I know you like to do deep.

1410
01:06:45,961 --> 01:06:48,360
Trust me three heads and you can.
He'll be beautiful.

1411
01:06:48,361 --> 01:06:51,660
It'd be mellow and they just.
This is more like an earthy,

1412
01:06:51,661 --> 01:06:52,494
nutty.

1413
01:06:53,580 --> 01:06:55,580
Somebody like the girls are like,
I always smoke this.

1414
01:06:55,620 --> 01:06:57,540
I start cleaning my whole house.
It makes me so mad.

1415
01:06:58,250 --> 01:06:59,083
Cleaning your own ass liar.
There is definitely some wheat I've had 

1416
01:07:03,391 --> 01:07:05,520
that makes me feel like cleaning my 
house.

1417
01:07:06,330 --> 01:07:07,460
Well,
you just look around you.

1418
01:07:07,550 --> 01:07:10,280
What am I doing with my fucking life?
Yeah,

1419
01:07:10,340 --> 01:07:11,640
eat edibles.
Do that to me.

1420
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:13,200
Edibles freaked me out,
man.

1421
01:07:13,350 --> 01:07:15,870
I had a bad edible the other day.
EverybOdy does.

1422
01:07:16,230 --> 01:07:17,380
If you take edibles,
you're going to have,

1423
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:22,520
but the good side of those is almost 
every time I've had a bad one I come out

1424
01:07:23,191 --> 01:07:27,420
of it and I realized like whatever was 
bothering me,

1425
01:07:27,780 --> 01:07:30,990
like whatever issues or whatever,
paranoia,

1426
01:07:30,991 --> 01:07:33,900
whatever weirdness,
I look at it from a different way.

1427
01:07:33,901 --> 01:07:35,430
I look aT it in a better way.
Oh,

1428
01:07:35,431 --> 01:07:39,090
here he is.
Even though I didn't believe this,

1429
01:07:40,010 --> 01:07:44,400
that's not real bad.
Acting always going to keep digging.

1430
01:07:46,070 --> 01:07:48,600
Don't know.
Have you ever hit some really harshly?

1431
01:07:48,650 --> 01:07:50,640
That just immediately tastes terrible.
Yeah.

1432
01:07:50,641 --> 01:07:51,361
Well,
here's the thing,

1433
01:07:51,361 --> 01:07:52,980
man.
We don't know that this,

1434
01:07:52,981 --> 01:07:53,814
uh,
that the oils from the pepper or 

1435
01:07:55,831 --> 01:07:59,790
transmitted in the air and they really 
don't know and that looks good.

1436
01:07:59,830 --> 01:08:02,590
Overacting from a hillbilly,
maybe a little bit,

1437
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:05,560
but maybe it's trying to get used to,
knows what he's doing with that,

1438
01:08:05,561 --> 01:08:06,394
but it's still like,

1439
01:08:06,980 --> 01:08:07,813
no man.
He mighT be seriously experiencing the 

1440
01:08:09,501 --> 01:08:10,520
oils.
I mean,

1441
01:08:10,521 --> 01:08:13,460
do you think the oils from the pepper,
that's where the heat is.

1442
01:08:13,461 --> 01:08:15,580
You think you can carry carrying the 
smoke be right?

1443
01:08:17,050 --> 01:08:19,550
If it can transmit just skin to your 
dick,

1444
01:08:20,030 --> 01:08:21,160
of course.
That's a good.

1445
01:08:21,210 --> 01:08:22,520
That's a good point.
Yeah.

1446
01:08:22,521 --> 01:08:24,470
This guy's fucked.
This is real dude.

1447
01:08:25,370 --> 01:08:26,600
Maybe.
Yeah.

1448
01:08:26,660 --> 01:08:30,350
I think this guy's foxville.
IT doesn't seem like a good idea either.

1449
01:08:31,250 --> 01:08:32,360
anyway,
watch this video.

1450
01:08:32,410 --> 01:08:35,330
Support it.
Give it a few folks.

1451
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:38,190
Don't go smoke.
Carolina rebreathe dumb ass.

1452
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:39,873
There's that.
There's this one guy that does it at 

1453
01:08:41,050 --> 01:08:41,883
vegas.
He like walks around on the streets in 

1454
01:08:43,061 --> 01:08:43,781
vegas and he goes,
hey,

1455
01:08:43,781 --> 01:08:44,614
you know what?
You eat one of these peppers is the 

1456
01:08:45,701 --> 01:08:46,534
hottest peppers you can eat it.
I'll give you 20 bucks and it's just 

1457
01:08:48,611 --> 01:08:49,444
destroying people's lives here.
Like families like dab will do it for a 

1458
01:08:52,620 --> 01:08:54,970
tour and you're trying to do a hot spicy
pepper,

1459
01:08:55,330 --> 01:08:56,163
you know,
but they're eating like those peppers 

1460
01:08:57,461 --> 01:09:01,990
and just like puking and crying like and
toxic.

1461
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:05,650
It's not.
You could probably get sued for.

1462
01:09:05,910 --> 01:09:06,743
Yeah,
but I mean is it toxic to the person as 

1463
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:10,960
a person eating a carolina reaper?
Is that toxic?

1464
01:09:10,990 --> 01:09:12,100
This is the guy.
What does it.

1465
01:09:13,090 --> 01:09:16,360
What does it say?
They're payinG people to worlds house.

1466
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:20,560
This guy's a complete asshole to like,
well,

1467
01:09:20,561 --> 01:09:21,394
I think you have to be.
If you're having people eat the worlD's 

1468
01:09:23,501 --> 01:09:26,170
hottest pepper,
he holding this guys

1469
01:09:26,450 --> 01:09:27,283
at the end of this video,
he acts like such a dick to this chick 

1470
01:09:29,810 --> 01:09:32,200
that made me hate this guy.
What?

1471
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:35,580
He's like a prick.
I think I've seen another video of his.

1472
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:36,553
There's a couple.
He's a prankster that dustin on the 

1473
01:09:37,881 --> 01:09:38,714
street and uh,
the strip in vegas and he might be 

1474
01:09:40,521 --> 01:09:42,620
getting away with extra.
Can't you do a,

1475
01:09:42,690 --> 01:09:44,000
do things in vegas?
Yeah.

1476
01:09:44,130 --> 01:09:45,120
Yeah.
That's why,

1477
01:09:45,121 --> 01:09:47,310
uh,
what was the comedy central show?

1478
01:09:47,430 --> 01:09:49,860
Okay.
I see people throw up anymore.

1479
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:54,430
Yeah.
Crank yankers yeah.

1480
01:09:54,431 --> 01:09:55,264
These,
do that in vegas because you could Just 

1481
01:09:55,861 --> 01:09:56,694
call people up.

1482
01:09:58,740 --> 01:09:59,573
Yeah.
that's the problem with tv and nowadays 

1483
01:10:01,321 --> 01:10:03,900
is half these shows are like that.
They're all like,

1484
01:10:03,901 --> 01:10:05,440
there's a show.
I don't want to say what it is.

1485
01:10:05,441 --> 01:10:06,274
It's,
I don't wanna say what network at his 

1486
01:10:06,631 --> 01:10:09,420
arm because people hate me so much when 
I talked shit on this network.

1487
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:11,210
But uH,
uh,

1488
01:10:11,250 --> 01:10:14,760
this show is a prank show where they pay
all the people in it.

1489
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:16,310
So the other people that are getting 
prankeD.

1490
01:10:16,311 --> 01:10:17,160
No,
they're getting prank,

1491
01:10:17,220 --> 01:10:19,500
but they sell it as a real show and 
dries me.

1492
01:10:19,690 --> 01:10:21,990
Why do you know that?
They know they're getting pranked before

1493
01:10:21,991 --> 01:10:22,370
the prank.

1494
01:10:22,370 --> 01:10:24,740
Okay.
Because I know somebody that did it.

1495
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:27,560
This is say he got paid to be a.
Okay.

1496
01:10:27,561 --> 01:10:28,394
So we're going to come in here.
We're going to hand make a fart sound 

1497
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:31,050
in.
You're going to,

1498
01:10:31,050 --> 01:10:32,570
you know,
like daily.

1499
01:10:32,571 --> 01:10:34,490
Yeah.
And it's on a channel that's.

1500
01:10:34,790 --> 01:10:35,623
Yeah.
Yeah.

1501
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:37,960
Huh?
I just,

1502
01:10:37,961 --> 01:10:40,360
I just hate that shit.
That's why I say get away with that.

1503
01:10:41,420 --> 01:10:44,980
They'll say it's a scripted show.
They say written by or I don't know.

1504
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:47,560
Probably.
What do you think?

1505
01:10:47,561 --> 01:10:49,000
They just hope that.
Well,

1506
01:10:49,001 --> 01:10:50,830
is it like here's the question,
right?

1507
01:10:51,220 --> 01:10:54,670
Is that different than like see that's a
prank.

1508
01:10:55,210 --> 01:10:58,030
Prank is like almost like a sketch,
right?

1509
01:10:58,031 --> 01:11:03,031
So if you have a setup sketch like that,
that's a bigger deception then a reality

1510
01:11:05,831 --> 01:11:10,420
show where you already know what you're 
going to do during that day.

1511
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:11,313
Right?
Right.

1512
01:11:11,620 --> 01:11:13,000
Like what's a reality show?
Like,

1513
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:14,040
oh,
we're all

1514
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:16,410
going to go to the football game,
you know,

1515
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:19,410
my sons playing football.
Today's is big day.

1516
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:20,880
And all the cameras day,
yay.

1517
01:11:20,881 --> 01:11:22,280
Go making enriched.
Here's like,

1518
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:24,630
like they know that they were going to 
do that,

1519
01:11:25,050 --> 01:11:28,980
but It is at least technically like a 
real thing you can do.

1520
01:11:29,050 --> 01:11:31,870
It's a real thing.
Meaning like they were going to do it if

1521
01:11:31,871 --> 01:11:34,990
the cameras were there and not exactly.
They know the cameras are there.

1522
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:38,980
So I consider that like duh.
They know the cameras are there,

1523
01:11:38,981 --> 01:11:40,400
I've accepted this.
I can see.

1524
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:42,060
But it's like real,
like the most.

1525
01:11:42,220 --> 01:11:43,540
One of my favorite shows is the profit.

1526
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:45,280
Yeah.
But it's a lie though.

1527
01:11:45,310 --> 01:11:48,010
All of it is a lie was different than.
The other thing is.

1528
01:11:48,011 --> 01:11:49,480
The other thing is like they're going to
the game.

1529
01:11:49,481 --> 01:11:50,600
Yay.
We're cheering.

1530
01:11:50,601 --> 01:11:52,580
We're aware of the cameras were acting 
weird because it.

1531
01:11:52,690 --> 01:11:53,523
But the other one,
you're pretending that you didn't know 

1532
01:11:55,421 --> 01:11:57,370
that that fart sound like a plan.
Yeah.

1533
01:11:58,410 --> 01:12:01,830
So like it's not really acting like 
you're,

1534
01:12:01,860 --> 01:12:04,660
you're being deceptive.
Deceptive.

1535
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:06,490
Right?
Like it's not.

1536
01:12:06,510 --> 01:12:09,940
You guys aren't doing a sketch about a 
prank show.

1537
01:12:09,941 --> 01:12:10,774
You're doing an acTual prank show zone.
The only one reason to watch an actual 

1538
01:12:14,111 --> 01:12:17,170
prank show is to see people legitimately
get what?

1539
01:12:17,380 --> 01:12:18,160
What do?
What do you mean?

1540
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:18,993
What does that speak like?
People come up to people and a lot of 

1541
01:12:21,701 --> 01:12:22,534
people act in weird ways.
You ever had someone come up to you and 

1542
01:12:24,341 --> 01:12:25,660
you don't know who they are and they 
touch you.

1543
01:12:25,710 --> 01:12:27,040
They got their hands on you like,
whoa,

1544
01:12:27,041 --> 01:12:27,550
whoa,
whoa.

1545
01:12:27,550 --> 01:12:29,260
Who are you?
What's this?

1546
01:12:29,620 --> 01:12:32,460
What's going on?
So people get weird and defensive.

1547
01:12:32,470 --> 01:12:37,470
Like that's a real prank show.
That's why like ali g in his prime,

1548
01:12:39,090 --> 01:12:39,923
in that ology character.
SOme of the all time best prank 

1549
01:12:43,521 --> 01:12:45,770
interviews ever.
I mean,

1550
01:12:45,771 --> 01:12:49,370
some of his shit was fucking hilarious.
Now,

1551
01:12:49,940 --> 01:12:50,773
could you imagine if you found out that 
those people on the other side were in 

1552
01:12:53,721 --> 01:12:54,554
on it?

1553
01:12:55,770 --> 01:12:58,440
Like remember he did not do one with ron
paul [inaudible].

1554
01:12:59,070 --> 01:13:02,070
He did one with Buzz aldrin.
Yeah.

1555
01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:05,580
How did you tell If the moon is made out
of cheese?

1556
01:13:09,370 --> 01:13:10,203
He had a bunch of like ridiculous 
fucking interviews with people where 

1557
01:13:13,261 --> 01:13:14,310
they just.
They couldn't.

1558
01:13:14,460 --> 01:13:15,293
They had no idea.
They thought he was a guy from an mtv 

1559
01:13:17,701 --> 01:13:20,010
show that had come to do interviews with
them.

1560
01:13:20,220 --> 01:13:21,730
Check it.
No,

1561
01:13:21,750 --> 01:13:23,700
he was the best.
It was the best.

1562
01:13:23,820 --> 01:13:26,130
If you found out those were all 
fraudulent,

1563
01:13:26,970 --> 01:13:27,840
wouldn't you be mad?

1564
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:29,250
Yeah,
and that's what I'm saying.

1565
01:13:29,251 --> 01:13:31,710
That's why it pisses me so off,
like not even.

1566
01:13:31,890 --> 01:13:32,723
That's one of the things that drives me 
crazy about this network because they 

1567
01:13:35,851 --> 01:13:39,390
have a lot of these shows just like that
where they're selling things that.

1568
01:13:39,810 --> 01:13:40,643
But is that okay if it's good?
It's not good when you know it's fake 

1569
01:13:43,381 --> 01:13:44,520
though.
You can tell it's fake.

1570
01:13:44,550 --> 01:13:45,383
A lot of the actors are such bad actors 
that you don't even need to know 

1571
01:13:49,351 --> 01:13:51,120
somebody that's working on you.
Just watch and go,

1572
01:13:51,121 --> 01:13:53,840
oh god,
they at least got good actors.

1573
01:13:53,850 --> 01:13:56,280
You know,
like it's that bad.

1574
01:13:57,170 --> 01:13:58,440
Well,
maybe it's tv.

1575
01:13:58,441 --> 01:14:00,690
I hate garbage to you,
but maybe in a way,

1576
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:05,730
maybe in a way.
It's good if you're really that stone.

1577
01:14:05,731 --> 01:14:06,930
I guess it's good.
Yeah.

1578
01:14:06,931 --> 01:14:09,840
Maybe in a way it's good because it's so
stupid.

1579
01:14:09,870 --> 01:14:12,220
like there's a show that I like.
Have you seen impractical

1580
01:14:12,220 --> 01:14:13,030
jokers?

1581
01:14:13,030 --> 01:14:13,863
No,
I have not,

1582
01:14:13,900 --> 01:14:17,690
but I've heard it's really good.
It's very funny and when they keep doing

1583
01:14:17,691 --> 01:14:20,630
it really bad,
what I'm saying is like if,

1584
01:14:20,690 --> 01:14:22,460
if it sucks,
I don't know.

1585
01:14:22,461 --> 01:14:24,560
It sucks because they haven't seen it,
but if it sucks,

1586
01:14:24,561 --> 01:14:25,850
as hard as yOu say,
it sucks.

1587
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:26,953
Some things that suck become awesome,
they suck and then you go to see him 

1588
01:14:32,211 --> 01:14:33,044
later or he seem when you're high or you
go to see them knowing that they suck 

1589
01:14:36,290 --> 01:14:38,930
like showgirls.
Remember showgirls?

1590
01:14:39,170 --> 01:14:42,590
God damn dude does one of my all time 
favorite ridiculous movies.

1591
01:14:42,620 --> 01:14:45,290
That's totally different than what I'm 
saying.

1592
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:49,120
Troll troll to.
It's like the worst movie ever made it.

1593
01:14:49,140 --> 01:14:51,140
Everyone loves it and I saw that 
documentary.

1594
01:14:51,150 --> 01:14:51,760
Yeah,

1595
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:53,320
it's so stupid,
dude.

1596
01:14:53,590 --> 01:14:55,510
It's so stupid,
but it's awesome.

1597
01:14:55,930 --> 01:14:57,200
You know,
but it's.

1598
01:14:57,490 --> 01:15:01,270
They have to be.
They have to be shitty on accident,

1599
01:15:01,780 --> 01:15:06,610
like waterworld,
like a movie that or worse way worse.

1600
01:15:06,700 --> 01:15:07,533
The post man,
you gotta give him credit because you 

1601
01:15:11,081 --> 01:15:14,230
know kevin costner is the man.
He did wyatt earp,

1602
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:17,260
which I really liked.
He did dances with wolves.

1603
01:15:17,350 --> 01:15:20,080
Dan's waterworld going to have a few 
fuck ups in there,

1604
01:15:20,081 --> 01:15:22,540
bro.
Just didn't work out,

1605
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:24,033
but what had happened in my pain was 
constant and a while he was doing a 

1606
01:15:27,701 --> 01:15:28,534
bunch of.
You think he's doing some new thing for 

1607
01:15:29,351 --> 01:15:30,610
hbo?
I believe too.

1608
01:15:30,770 --> 01:15:33,010
It can't be on purpose.
You can't make something bad.

1609
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:34,970
Yes.
You can't make something bad on purpose.

1610
01:15:34,971 --> 01:15:35,804
My point being like a movie like 
showgirls and there's a few other ones 

1611
01:15:39,651 --> 01:15:44,651
you could go back to Texas roadhouse and
a lot of ways I fucking love roadhouse,

1612
01:15:46,550 --> 01:15:49,610
but it's so dumb.
It's so dumb when you watch it,

1613
01:15:49,611 --> 01:15:51,950
it's awesome.
It becomes really good.

1614
01:15:51,980 --> 01:15:56,540
It goes away from being like Just a 
statement,

1615
01:15:57,610 --> 01:16:00,980
like a just a bad ass action movie and 
it becomes a comedy,

1616
01:16:01,190 --> 01:16:02,023
like it really does morph,
especially over time because what it's 

1617
01:16:05,301 --> 01:16:06,021
like,
it's like something.

1618
01:16:06,021 --> 01:16:10,490
You had a plant and it had to grow and 
as culture grew around,

1619
01:16:10,491 --> 01:16:11,324
roadhouse roadhouse is in a lot of ways 
it's a time capsule because it captures 

1620
01:16:17,001 --> 01:16:21,680
how fucking ridiculous people were in 
the year that it was made where you will

1621
01:16:21,681 --> 01:16:22,514
let you.
You could see like what people accepted 

1622
01:16:24,111 --> 01:16:27,410
back then.
You could see how lame the script is,

1623
01:16:27,530 --> 01:16:28,363
how ridiculous the dialogue is,
how preposterous the fucking plot is is 

1624
01:16:33,351 --> 01:16:34,184
a bad guy.
I've been screwing this town over and 

1625
01:16:35,811 --> 01:16:38,300
out.
I'll have keeps drilling them over like,

1626
01:16:38,460 --> 01:16:39,293
hey,
you've been screwing up his towel for 

1627
01:16:40,731 --> 01:16:42,670
too long.
a cheap.

1628
01:16:42,710 --> 01:16:47,710
Keep screwing them over too.
it's so bad that it becomes awesome.

1629
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:50,793
Are you worried about the potential new 
one they're going to make and the 

1630
01:16:54,490 --> 01:16:55,323
thought behind it might be they're going
to try to make something badly awesome 

1631
01:16:57,941 --> 01:17:00,550
again,
but start with bad intentions.

1632
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:03,580
Here's what I think.
I think.

1633
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:05,993
Do you piggy back like,
and this is coming from a guy who did 

1634
01:17:08,071 --> 01:17:10,040
the man show to version to me and

1635
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:14,900
stan home,
but I think you piggy back on when you.

1636
01:17:14,901 --> 01:17:17,020
When you're,
you're confined to the ideal,

1637
01:17:17,021 --> 01:17:19,710
like you piggyback on the love that the 
original roadhouse hat,

1638
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:21,230
right?
Because it's a classic movie.

1639
01:17:21,410 --> 01:17:24,320
You piggyback on that love and you're 
already in a deficit.

1640
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:28,670
It's like the ghostbusters thing,
which by the way wasn't a good movie.

1641
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:30,860
It was a good movie for a little bit 
though.

1642
01:17:31,220 --> 01:17:33,200
There was some funny shit and 
ghostbusters,

1643
01:17:33,201 --> 01:17:35,450
but then it got monotonous and I didn't 
enJoy the end,

1644
01:17:35,900 --> 01:17:38,780
but I thought you told me you loved it.
I love some parts of it,

1645
01:17:38,790 --> 01:17:41,020
so I bought it based on your 
recommendation.

1646
01:17:41,170 --> 01:17:43,510
Not saying I love that.
Definitely did not say I love it.

1647
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:45,710
It just wasn't a good show.
At the end of it I was like,

1648
01:17:45,711 --> 01:17:46,550
wow,
this is like,

1649
01:17:46,970 --> 01:17:51,110
it seems like 200 people fucked with it.
It's one of those things where sometimes

1650
01:17:51,111 --> 01:17:54,380
you look at a movie and you go,
what so much going on here?

1651
01:17:54,410 --> 01:17:58,280
So much special effects.
The special effects were so monumental.

1652
01:17:58,310 --> 01:18:01,360
The one at the end that used to be the 
donut guy or the,

1653
01:18:01,361 --> 01:18:02,790
uh,
the pillsbury doughboy.

1654
01:18:02,791 --> 01:18:04,400
Yeah.
In the original ghostbusters,

1655
01:18:04,550 --> 01:18:05,383
that fucking thing is taken to this 
crazy new cgi level where they're going 

1656
01:18:09,681 --> 01:18:10,730
into,
spoiler alert,

1657
01:18:10,970 --> 01:18:11,803
they're going into other dimensions or 
retrieving their friends and it's 

1658
01:18:14,451 --> 01:18:18,020
fucking craziness.
Fucking craziness.

1659
01:18:18,770 --> 01:18:19,603
But there were some funny moments in the
beginning of that movie where I laughed 

1660
01:18:22,251 --> 01:18:23,480
pretty hard.
I was like,

1661
01:18:23,481 --> 01:18:26,450
there's a funny fucking movie.
I tend to Just lost its way,

1662
01:18:26,540 --> 01:18:28,700
I felt,
but it's hard to make a movie,

1663
01:18:28,701 --> 01:18:29,534
man.
I bought that godzilla movie that came 

1664
01:18:30,621 --> 01:18:32,960
out like two years ago.
That was dog shit.

1665
01:18:33,170 --> 01:18:34,700
You didn't like it.
I thought it was okay.

1666
01:18:34,701 --> 01:18:36,770
The guy from breaking bad in it and 
stuff.

1667
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:38,420
He was great.
He was great and everything,

1668
01:18:38,810 --> 01:18:39,670
but it was like god.

1669
01:18:39,700 --> 01:18:41,480
So corny.
You know they're making another one.

1670
01:18:41,481 --> 01:18:43,940
Right.
Was funds being made by a.

1671
01:18:43,941 --> 01:18:44,774
I think it's being made in Japan,
so it's like the way they originally 

1672
01:18:47,541 --> 01:18:49,730
made god.
Here's my problem with it.

1673
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:50,593
I shouldn't say it's corny because I 
love monster movies and it definitely 

1674
01:18:52,131 --> 01:18:55,100
don't want to discourage monster movies 
and we'll absolutely see it next time it

1675
01:18:55,101 --> 01:18:55,934
comes out.
The problem Is there's a dude in this 

1676
01:18:58,041 --> 01:18:59,360
movie,
spoiler alert,

1677
01:18:59,450 --> 01:19:01,190
the original godzilla,
not the original,

1678
01:19:01,191 --> 01:19:03,770
but the most recent one,
the one with the guy from breaking bad.

1679
01:19:04,070 --> 01:19:04,903
There's a.
There's a dude that keeps fucking 

1680
01:19:06,801 --> 01:19:08,900
surviving.
This guy,

1681
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:12,530
I mean he falls off buildings.
He said earthquakes.

1682
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:14,660
they dig them out of the bottom of the 
fucking earth.

1683
01:19:14,661 --> 01:19:17,120
He's dusts himself off.
I'm going to go fight godzilla.

1684
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:19,300
His fucking families waiting back.
For me.

1685
01:19:19,301 --> 01:19:22,790
It's just a.
It's a tornado of cliches that literally

1686
01:19:22,791 --> 01:19:26,180
literally makes you travel back in time 
to the 19 sixties.

1687
01:19:26,420 --> 01:19:29,180
It's so corny to like look at each other
in the eye.

1688
01:19:29,910 --> 01:19:30,743
It's a big green monster.
I think you could do that big green 

1689
01:19:37,761 --> 01:19:38,594
monster with like the kind of People 
that write game of thrones or tHe kind 

1690
01:19:43,131 --> 01:19:45,440
of people that are writing this 
westworld show.

1691
01:19:46,010 --> 01:19:50,560
Holy shit.
Westworld is good.

1692
01:19:50,710 --> 01:19:51,543
What is this head?
Fucking harris is playing the yule 

1693
01:19:54,741 --> 01:19:55,574
brenner character from the movie 
westworld from 1973 and now they made a 

1694
01:20:00,531 --> 01:20:01,364
series of it on hbo and it's amazing.
People are still even moods you fuck 

1695
01:20:07,110 --> 01:20:11,060
fucking terrible taste in shoes or to 
us.

1696
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:14,670
It'S fucking good.
This is a really good show.

1697
01:20:14,671 --> 01:20:17,160
It's complex.
It's weird.

1698
01:20:17,460 --> 01:20:19,770
There's all these patterns that you 
don't expect.

1699
01:20:20,010 --> 01:20:22,510
There's a lot of weird shit going on.
It's a.

1700
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:27,240
It's a strange kind of violence because 
it's like a robot violence will hope I.

1701
01:20:27,420 --> 01:20:28,440
Yeah.
Do this whole.

1702
01:20:28,470 --> 01:20:31,500
This movie is a trip or this show rather
is a trip.

1703
01:20:31,580 --> 01:20:33,720
Oh cool.
And it just keeps getting better.

1704
01:20:34,260 --> 01:20:37,040
They've been like $25,
million dollars a hopkins.

1705
01:20:37,910 --> 01:20:38,743
Anthony hopkins is in it.
ed harris is fucking fantastic in this 

1706
01:20:42,961 --> 01:20:45,330
show.
He freaks me out at home.

1707
01:20:45,570 --> 01:20:47,790
I'm at home and I'm on my couch.
I'm like,

1708
01:20:47,791 --> 01:20:50,550
please don't let that boogeyman come get
me.

1709
01:20:51,090 --> 01:20:51,923
Ed harris.
You forget what a bad motherfucker he 

1710
01:20:53,971 --> 01:20:55,380
is,
and he watched his show.

1711
01:20:56,060 --> 01:20:57,480
Wow,
this looks really interesting.

1712
01:20:57,481 --> 01:20:59,170
I thought it was just a cowboy shirt.
No,

1713
01:20:59,171 --> 01:20:59,491
no,
no,

1714
01:20:59,491 --> 01:21:00,720
no.
It's about westworld.

1715
01:21:00,750 --> 01:21:03,990
The movie westworld was all about a 
place where you would go,

1716
01:21:04,170 --> 01:21:05,003
well,
you'd have these shoot them ups with 

1717
01:21:06,061 --> 01:21:06,894
robots and the robots eventually smarten
up and rebel and that's what this show 

1718
01:21:11,431 --> 01:21:12,470
is about.
It's fuck it.

1719
01:21:12,471 --> 01:21:13,710
There's ed harris.
Dude,

1720
01:21:13,711 --> 01:21:14,544
I'm telling you.
I kinda forgot how good of an actor ed 

1721
01:21:17,971 --> 01:21:18,804
harris's.
You watch him in this movie and you're 

1722
01:21:20,341 --> 01:21:21,174
like,
this guy's one of the most untalked 

1723
01:21:23,671 --> 01:21:25,500
about best actors ever.

1724
01:21:25,540 --> 01:21:29,400
It's great.
he's so creepy in this fucking show.

1725
01:21:30,330 --> 01:21:31,740
I'm watching this tonight,
dude.

1726
01:21:31,741 --> 01:21:35,340
He's so good at freaks me out.
like I really believe him.

1727
01:21:35,660 --> 01:21:38,700
You know?
I really believe he's a psychotic madman

1728
01:21:38,790 --> 01:21:42,150
that can't be killed.
It's fucking awesome man.

1729
01:21:42,210 --> 01:21:44,280
It's really good.
I recommend mr.

1730
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:45,510
Robot,
but every said that to you.

1731
01:21:45,540 --> 01:21:46,041
It's.
Yeah.

1732
01:21:46,041 --> 01:21:49,500
I don't have that time for that.
I love it.

1733
01:21:49,940 --> 01:21:52,650
It's right up your alley.
I prime for one robot.

1734
01:21:52,770 --> 01:21:53,603
Christian Slater thing is like,
this is the problem with movies like 

1735
01:21:55,891 --> 01:21:58,200
godzilla.
No disrespect to godzilla again.

1736
01:21:58,201 --> 01:21:59,034
I love a good monster movie.
I watched the fucking wolf man with 

1737
01:22:01,051 --> 01:22:03,570
Benicio del toro like five times.
I don't even like it.

1738
01:22:04,170 --> 01:22:05,003
I thought it was corny,
but I watched like five times just 

1739
01:22:06,331 --> 01:22:09,600
because I love a fucking werewolf movie.
It's fun.

1740
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:11,540
It's cool.
When you,

1741
01:22:11,541 --> 01:22:16,260
when you do movies like godzilla and you
have these kind of,

1742
01:22:16,350 --> 01:22:17,183
you know,
really cookie cutter cliche cbs drama 

1743
01:22:22,620 --> 01:22:23,280
type.

1744
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:25,440
You know what I mean?
Like it's like that like a show.

1745
01:22:25,441 --> 01:22:27,990
It's not a bad show,
but like a tv show,

1746
01:22:27,991 --> 01:22:30,870
it's kind of obvious what's happening to
the other.

1747
01:22:30,940 --> 01:22:31,773
Wrap it up nice and tight at the end and
you have to compete against game of 

1748
01:22:34,831 --> 01:22:36,540
thrones,
game of thrones,

1749
01:22:36,541 --> 01:22:39,750
which goes season.
It's like a movie every week and it goes

1750
01:22:39,751 --> 01:22:43,920
season after season of chaos and 
awesomeness and amazing writing.

1751
01:22:44,250 --> 01:22:48,000
Like you can't just have that dude 
living over and over again,

1752
01:22:48,180 --> 01:22:50,370
getting trampled by godzilla.
I'm fine.

1753
01:22:50,371 --> 01:22:53,490
I'm just fucking this fucking dinosaur 
up.

1754
01:22:53,610 --> 01:22:55,230
This to just keeps getting his ass 
kicked.

1755
01:22:55,231 --> 01:22:57,360
He's falling out of helicopters into the
ocean,

1756
01:22:57,450 --> 01:22:59,310
swimming to soar.
Fuck up godzilla.

1757
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:02,220
He just keeps surviving and it's driving
me nuts.

1758
01:23:02,340 --> 01:23:04,290
He doesn't even have a coma,
You know,

1759
01:23:04,291 --> 01:23:06,400
concussion.
No broken bones.

1760
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:09,280
Yeah.
I fucked up my neck And a shower once,

1761
01:23:09,281 --> 01:23:09,940
dude.

1762
01:23:09,940 --> 01:23:10,773
Okay.
I,

1763
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:11,713
I turned around and try to grab some 
shampoo and I popped my neck and I had 

1764
01:23:14,621 --> 01:23:18,160
to drive to vegas that day and I drove 
to vegas like this.

1765
01:23:18,250 --> 01:23:19,083
Uh,
this fucking dudes get launched off the 

1766
01:23:21,281 --> 01:23:24,580
top of buildings and dinosaurs are 
chasing them.

1767
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:29,530
And in the end he sticks around to watch
the fight out between god's bad.

1768
01:23:29,531 --> 01:23:30,364
You'd be shitting your fucking pants if 
you were in a boat off the coast of 

1769
01:23:33,371 --> 01:23:34,204
seattle and a 600 pound lizard was 
duking it out with another 600 pound 

1770
01:23:38,921 --> 01:23:39,754
lizard and they're fucking going to war 
with fire breath and one of them opens 

1771
01:23:43,781 --> 01:23:44,614
up.
The other ones had and blows fire into 

1772
01:23:46,301 --> 01:23:47,530
it.
Spoiler.

1773
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:50,260
You would not be sitting there going,
yeah,

1774
01:23:50,300 --> 01:23:51,850
godzilla go,
good.

1775
01:23:51,890 --> 01:23:54,190
That thing's gonna.
Fuck you up to stupid.

1776
01:23:54,430 --> 01:23:55,263
It's going to fuck up everything.
It's not going to care about these ants 

1777
01:23:57,281 --> 01:24:00,280
in these buildings.
You wouldn't be watching that.

1778
01:24:01,300 --> 01:24:02,860
You can't say out.
You can't say.

1779
01:24:02,861 --> 01:24:03,694
Those people wouldn't be screaming and 
crying and spasming and snot pouring 

1780
01:24:10,121 --> 01:24:14,230
down their nose and terrified because 
their eyes must be deceiving them.

1781
01:24:14,231 --> 01:24:19,231
They're watching a 600 foot lizard that 
lives in the ocean and blows fire out of

1782
01:24:20,270 --> 01:24:21,103
its mouth and it's not going over 
buildings like their little cardboard 

1783
01:24:24,341 --> 01:24:25,174
boxes.
That's what he just sitting off the 

1784
01:24:28,061 --> 01:24:29,200
coast watching this.

1785
01:24:31,570 --> 01:24:32,403
You'd be shitting your pants.
There's not enough cool in the world to 

1786
01:24:35,951 --> 01:24:39,220
just sit there and watch that.
You'd be like,

1787
01:24:39,221 --> 01:24:40,480
fuck,
how far as Australia?

1788
01:24:40,570 --> 01:24:41,650
Fuck,
fuck,

1789
01:24:41,710 --> 01:24:45,310
fuck.
You just get to a plane or to a boat.

1790
01:24:45,311 --> 01:24:47,950
You get In a traffic jam.
People would die.

1791
01:24:47,951 --> 01:24:49,990
They would run over each other and not 
care.

1792
01:24:50,260 --> 01:24:51,093
That would trample each other like a 
fire in a building all throughout the 

1793
01:24:53,141 --> 01:24:58,141
land to get the fuck away from a 600 
foot fire breathing lizard.

1794
01:24:58,930 --> 01:25:03,130
So until you show that in the movies,
you have failed us in this.

1795
01:25:03,910 --> 01:25:04,930
You have failed us

1796
01:25:05,190 --> 01:25:09,610
in this portrayal.
We're going to say we'd actually,

1797
01:25:09,611 --> 01:25:12,530
that just came out yesterday.
What movie know?

1798
01:25:12,610 --> 01:25:13,890
But that's the fake.
that's the.

1799
01:25:13,891 --> 01:25:16,080
Yeah,
that's the one that came up dahlia.

1800
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:18,480
That's the japanese one.
The guys are wearing suits.

1801
01:25:18,481 --> 01:25:19,310
yeah,
right.

1802
01:25:19,310 --> 01:25:20,220
It's still good.
Good.

1803
01:25:20,260 --> 01:25:21,340
It's,
it's just a different kind.

1804
01:25:21,390 --> 01:25:22,750
It's like the original godzilla.
Good.

1805
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:25,480
I would like to see that.
That's kind of good.

1806
01:25:25,540 --> 01:25:28,050
It actually got good reviews and it 
actually looks really cool.

1807
01:25:28,470 --> 01:25:29,303
Look,
the movie godzilla and the idea of 

1808
01:25:31,861 --> 01:25:35,220
godzilla is very fun.
The ocean is

1809
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:39,850
fucking huge folks and uh,
there's whales in it.

1810
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:42,170
Right?
Okay.

1811
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:46,780
So we know that there's something as big
as a godzilla sort of.

1812
01:25:47,230 --> 01:25:48,063
Not really like what's a big whale,
how many hundreds of feet is a big 

1813
01:25:51,011 --> 01:25:51,844
whale?
There's the size comparison of the 

1814
01:25:53,441 --> 01:25:55,420
godzilla is of all of them.
Yeah.

1815
01:25:55,421 --> 01:25:57,400
They all get bigger.
We need bigger.

1816
01:25:57,401 --> 01:26:02,080
We need to double doubles and big gulps.
Big gulps.

1817
01:26:02,081 --> 01:26:04,550
And our godzilla's what I just asked 
you.

1818
01:26:04,551 --> 01:26:05,980
Jamie whale.
oh this?

1819
01:26:06,090 --> 01:26:08,240
Yeah.
How big is the biggest whale?

1820
01:26:09,590 --> 01:26:11,070
Sperm.
Is it a sperm whale?

1821
01:26:11,071 --> 01:26:12,380
A blue whale?
Blue whale.

1822
01:26:13,490 --> 01:26:15,860
How much?
One hundred and 70 meters?

1823
01:26:15,890 --> 01:26:17,270
Ninety eight feet.
okay.

1824
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:18,560
Wow.
Wow.

1825
01:26:19,670 --> 01:26:22,940
Okay.
So that's still quite a bit smaller than

1826
01:26:22,941 --> 01:26:23,774
godzilla.
But if a whale can be real and a whale 

1827
01:26:30,830 --> 01:26:35,830
is 93 feet long and you are five.
Eight.

1828
01:26:38,140 --> 01:26:40,940
Okay.
So we know one thing can be way bigger,

1829
01:26:41,180 --> 01:26:42,230
right?
Because I'm five,

1830
01:26:42,240 --> 01:26:43,073
eight,
but my daughter has a hamster and that 

1831
01:26:44,391 --> 01:26:47,360
little fucker fits in my hand.
So let's start thinking here.

1832
01:26:47,510 --> 01:26:48,343
What's the stop?
Something from getting godzilla sized 

1833
01:26:50,820 --> 01:26:53,750
for so far we haven't really seen 
anything other than the dinosaurs.

1834
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:55,670
But then it really got godzilla sized 
either.

1835
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:58,040
But it doesn't mean that it couldn't 
have happened.

1836
01:26:58,060 --> 01:27:02,330
Me and someone probably has like an 
argument against like the gravity effect

1837
01:27:02,331 --> 01:27:03,164
on something that large,
like how much mass you'd have to be 

1838
01:27:05,151 --> 01:27:07,790
moving around and how big your muscles 
and bones would have to be.

1839
01:27:08,450 --> 01:27:12,410
They'll they say that happens to certain
animals at a certain size.

1840
01:27:12,411 --> 01:27:15,020
It just becomes impractical due to the 
environment of earth.

1841
01:27:15,340 --> 01:27:16,173
And that was one of the things that they
thought was a reason why the dinosaurs 

1842
01:27:18,441 --> 01:27:19,460
are so huge.

1843
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:20,593
Was it?
The atmosphere might've been different 

1844
01:27:21,861 --> 01:27:22,694
than that.
It might've been a different kind of 

1845
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:29,000
atmosphere that allowed them to move 
more easily,

1846
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:30,650
which is really fascinating.
Right?

1847
01:27:30,740 --> 01:27:32,900
Where oxygen maybe.
Well,

1848
01:27:32,901 --> 01:27:34,790
I think it was way warmer,
right?

1849
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:35,713
Wasn't that in real tropical?
I think they think during the dinosaur 

1850
01:27:38,661 --> 01:27:41,030
days,
obviously not everywhere.

1851
01:27:41,031 --> 01:27:42,980
There's,
I'm sure they had probably had polarized

1852
01:27:42,981 --> 01:27:43,814
caps even back then.
But I think that the temperature in the 

1853
01:27:47,181 --> 01:27:50,420
jurassic and the other,
um,

1854
01:27:50,570 --> 01:27:53,930
here we go here,
dinosaur era at five times today,

1855
01:27:53,950 --> 01:27:55,310
ceo two.
There you go.

1856
01:27:56,170 --> 01:27:59,000
Oh wow.
Listen to that folks.

1857
01:27:59,180 --> 01:28:01,160
Okay.
So they had,

1858
01:28:01,310 --> 01:28:02,143
they knew world.
The dinosaurs roamed the earth 250 

1859
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:07,580
million years ago,
knew a world with five times more carbon

1860
01:28:07,581 --> 01:28:09,650
dioxide than president earth.
Today,

1861
01:28:10,220 --> 01:28:11,053
researchers say,
and new techniques for estimating the 

1862
01:28:13,371 --> 01:28:14,204
amount of carbon dioxide on prehistoric 
earth may help scientists predict how 

1863
01:28:18,441 --> 01:28:20,240
earth's climate may change in the 
future.

1864
01:28:20,240 --> 01:28:21,650
Fuck dude,
we're going to have dinosaurs.

1865
01:28:22,040 --> 01:28:23,990
We fucked up.
We fucked up.

1866
01:28:23,991 --> 01:28:26,630
We had coal power plants and we're gonna
make dinosaurs.

1867
01:28:26,780 --> 01:28:27,613
Those lizards are just going to keep 
getting bigger and bigger and all the 

1868
01:28:29,901 --> 01:28:30,734
liberals are going to go.
We have to keep them alive because 

1869
01:28:33,430 --> 01:28:38,320
they're important part of our ecosystem 
and they are scaly.

1870
01:28:38,330 --> 01:28:39,163
Friends can.
And then the alligators just keep 

1871
01:28:41,221 --> 01:28:43,760
getting bigger and alligators get to be 
like 30 feet long.

1872
01:28:43,761 --> 01:28:44,594
And people go,
hey,

1873
01:28:45,230 --> 01:28:47,990
what's going on?
Why the alligators so big?

1874
01:28:48,220 --> 01:28:49,550
Like they're getting bigger.
do you guys?

1875
01:28:49,570 --> 01:28:50,030
no,
no,

1876
01:28:50,030 --> 01:28:50,451
no,
no.

1877
01:28:50,451 --> 01:28:53,000
These are just unusual examples.
These are outliers.

1878
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:56,110
These are outliers of our scaly friends.
And uh,

1879
01:28:56,120 --> 01:29:00,710
you know,
a size shame as a human or with animals.

1880
01:29:00,740 --> 01:29:01,573
And a big alligators don't next.
He no alligators or 300 feet long anD 

1881
01:29:05,131 --> 01:29:08,100
they just smashing through buildings,
eaten your kids.

1882
01:29:09,450 --> 01:29:12,560
JuraSsic park was technically real 
alligators.

1883
01:29:12,570 --> 01:29:13,403
Keep growing.
My story that I'm talking about right 

1884
01:29:14,191 --> 01:29:16,020
now,
it's not too far off of that.

1885
01:29:16,021 --> 01:29:18,320
like what would you go visit it?
They kept them on.

1886
01:29:18,490 --> 01:29:22,680
Why jesus jv?
I don't know man.

1887
01:29:22,681 --> 01:29:26,340
I'm just saying that at one point in 
time the alligators keep getting bigger.

1888
01:29:26,550 --> 01:29:27,420
They're going to have to say,
okay,

1889
01:29:27,421 --> 01:29:28,500
they're too big.
We gotta kill him.

1890
01:29:28,700 --> 01:29:29,533
Yeah,
we can't have him wandering around if 

1891
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:33,180
they're 50 feet long and they just want 
to kill people,

1892
01:29:33,210 --> 01:29:34,140
we can't do that.
Right.

1893
01:29:34,350 --> 01:29:37,830
so my point is they accept alligators up
to a certain size.

1894
01:29:38,130 --> 01:29:38,963
Like right now,
alligators like the alligator on the 

1895
01:29:40,501 --> 01:29:41,334
golf course video,
which got like millions and millions of 

1896
01:29:42,900 --> 01:29:44,730
hits.
That alligator was like 15 feet long.

1897
01:29:45,060 --> 01:29:47,010
Like that.
Alligator is like on the border.

1898
01:29:47,190 --> 01:29:48,900
Like okay,
we're letting that thing live.

1899
01:29:49,150 --> 01:29:53,340
You don't let this 15 foot long monster 
just roam around and everybody's like,

1900
01:29:53,341 --> 01:29:54,600
hey,
we always have before.

1901
01:29:54,601 --> 01:29:55,110
Okay,
okay,

1902
01:29:55,110 --> 01:29:55,943
okay,
we're cool.

1903
01:29:55,950 --> 01:29:58,770
Cool.
But if he's 30 feet long,

1904
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:00,330
you're not going to be out there.
Right?

1905
01:30:00,390 --> 01:30:04,020
If he's 90 feet long,
like a fucking whale,

1906
01:30:04,350 --> 01:30:05,183
you're not going to be out there.
No one's going to be out there and 

1907
01:30:07,021 --> 01:30:09,060
you're not going to be safe.
That's a giant carnivore.

1908
01:30:09,180 --> 01:30:11,580
So my point was,
what?

1909
01:30:11,670 --> 01:30:14,180
When do we shoot that thing?
We.

1910
01:30:14,760 --> 01:30:16,950
Would you shoot it or would you capture 
it?

1911
01:30:18,270 --> 01:30:21,360
Sci world record stakes,
stokes,

1912
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:23,010
stokes,
or stakes stokes.

1913
01:30:23,100 --> 01:30:24,300
Stokes,
stokes,

1914
01:30:24,301 --> 01:30:25,680
alligator.
What's the stokes alligator?

1915
01:30:26,090 --> 01:30:27,120
Is that a type of alligator?

1916
01:30:28,430 --> 01:30:29,263
no.

1917
01:30:30,290 --> 01:30:31,970
Fifteen feet.
Nine inches long.

1918
01:30:31,971 --> 01:30:34,700
Holy shit.
God.

1919
01:30:34,760 --> 01:30:35,060
Oh,
see,

1920
01:30:35,060 --> 01:30:36,980
that's an sci.
You know what that means?

1921
01:30:36,981 --> 01:30:40,210
That's safari club international.
That's like a,

1922
01:30:40,280 --> 01:30:42,530
it might be.
Make sure that I'm correct there.

1923
01:30:43,460 --> 01:30:44,700
But that's like,
um,

1924
01:30:44,750 --> 01:30:45,583
that's one of those organizations that 
measures the largest animals of each 

1925
01:30:48,711 --> 01:30:50,300
species that were killed hunting.

1926
01:30:51,390 --> 01:30:52,223
hmm.

1927
01:30:52,570 --> 01:30:54,850
So that's,
that might be what that is.

1928
01:30:55,350 --> 01:30:57,460
See If that's right.
Is that the sci?

1929
01:30:59,590 --> 01:31:00,870
What is it?
Stokes was.

1930
01:31:00,900 --> 01:31:02,380
It keeps saying.
oh,

1931
01:31:02,590 --> 01:31:06,730
the name mandy stokes told the website 
now.

1932
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:08,870
Okay.
Dan.

1933
01:31:11,010 --> 01:31:12,030
Oh yeah,
they kIlled it.

1934
01:31:12,930 --> 01:31:14,510
They killed that thing.
Eric.

1935
01:31:14,511 --> 01:31:15,344
It goes so that she went through with a 
range of emotions as they first stalk 

1936
01:31:18,551 --> 01:31:20,400
the animal before baiting it.
Oh,

1937
01:31:20,401 --> 01:31:21,234
battling it and killing it.
Finally struggling to take it and 

1938
01:31:26,521 --> 01:31:28,320
finally struggling to take it back to 
shore.

1939
01:31:28,321 --> 01:31:32,250
How weird alligator meat is supposed to 
be super good for you,

1940
01:31:32,580 --> 01:31:33,930
which is really kind of crazy,
right?

1941
01:31:33,931 --> 01:31:36,450
You look at that thing like,
how could you eat that fucking thing?

1942
01:31:37,020 --> 01:31:39,300
But apparently their tails are 
delicious.

1943
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:41,460
You just have to,
uh,

1944
01:31:41,490 --> 01:31:46,260
prepare it properly and you get it like 
right off the alligator and that,

1945
01:31:46,830 --> 01:31:47,660
those things

1946
01:31:47,660 --> 01:31:49,310
in that place we used to always go to in
Texas,

1947
01:31:49,490 --> 01:31:52,040
have alligator soup.
Oh yeah,

1948
01:31:52,041 --> 01:31:52,874
yeah.
Yeah.

1949
01:31:53,180 --> 01:31:58,180
So he's favorite place.
Was it popping out in the hotel is right

1950
01:31:58,641 --> 01:31:59,441
next door,
right,

1951
01:31:59,441 --> 01:32:00,070
right.

1952
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:01,950
There's more than one dose.
There's,

1953
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:02,833
there's like a poppa doughs and just 
like does a seafood one and the cajun 

1954
01:32:06,250 --> 01:32:07,083
one,
right.

1955
01:32:07,720 --> 01:32:08,980
There's a steakhouse.
They have like a,

1956
01:32:09,070 --> 01:32:10,050
it's like a bunch of.
Yeah,

1957
01:32:10,100 --> 01:32:11,050
it's a chain.
Yeah.

1958
01:32:11,670 --> 01:32:13,030
Yeah.
I think if you get alligator,

1959
01:32:13,031 --> 01:32:13,864
you've got to get it from someone who 
shot the alligator like I think or get 

1960
01:32:17,501 --> 01:32:22,390
it from a chef that knows how to get it.
Like when it's really fresh.

1961
01:32:22,570 --> 01:32:25,070
It's supposed to be amazing.
It's.

1962
01:32:26,180 --> 01:32:28,180
It's a really uncomfortable subject for 
people.

1963
01:32:28,330 --> 01:32:29,163
At what point in time are we in danger 
and at what point in time do we step in 

1964
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:33,633
like a grizzly bears?
Just start wandering the streets and 

1965
01:32:35,141 --> 01:32:35,974
eating people.
Are we gonna have the same feeling that 

1966
01:32:37,571 --> 01:32:39,790
we have about them in the woods?
no,

1967
01:32:39,820 --> 01:32:40,653
we're not going to.
So we're going to have to do something 

1968
01:32:42,071 --> 01:32:42,640
then,
right?

1969
01:32:42,640 --> 01:32:43,151
Yeah.
Okay.

1970
01:32:43,151 --> 01:32:44,680
I just checking.
I just want to check.

1971
01:32:44,890 --> 01:32:45,723
I just want to know what team you're on.
I'm not saying we need to go to the 

1972
01:32:47,530 --> 01:32:51,820
woods and clean out the grizzly bears.
I just want to know if the grizzly bears

1973
01:32:51,910 --> 01:32:53,530
come to burbank.
Okay.

1974
01:32:53,531 --> 01:32:54,910
We can stop that.
Right?

1975
01:32:55,150 --> 01:32:56,320
We could shoot them.
Right.

1976
01:32:56,500 --> 01:32:58,510
If the grizzly bears just start eating 
people in burbank.

1977
01:32:58,660 --> 01:33:00,940
You're on team people write it.
Okay.

1978
01:33:01,620 --> 01:33:02,453
I'm not.
I'm not saying we should kill them in 

1979
01:33:03,260 --> 01:33:05,650
yellowstone.
Hey live and let live.

1980
01:33:05,651 --> 01:33:09,310
Let those big giant monsters go wander 
through the woods.

1981
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:10,960
Have a good time.
Eat your hiker.

1982
01:33:11,080 --> 01:33:15,610
OCcasional oCcasional hiker.
Just stay the fuck out of,

1983
01:33:15,611 --> 01:33:16,630
uh,
san francisco,

1984
01:33:17,220 --> 01:33:18,053
right?
If grizzlies started wandering through 

1985
01:33:18,581 --> 01:33:21,070
san francisco.
Fuck that dude.

1986
01:33:21,820 --> 01:33:22,653
I was in this town near bakersfield 
called le bec and it's named after a 

1987
01:33:28,001 --> 01:33:28,834
dude named peter lubeck,
who is purportedly the last man in 

1988
01:33:31,661 --> 01:33:33,910
California to get killed by a grizzly 
bear.

1989
01:33:35,090 --> 01:33:37,510
So I went to the website to read about 
this dude.

1990
01:33:37,780 --> 01:33:38,960
And uh,
that's.

1991
01:33:39,140 --> 01:33:39,973
We're reading it.
I'm reading that his feet were bitten 

1992
01:33:42,431 --> 01:33:43,420
off.
This is not financial.

1993
01:33:43,510 --> 01:33:46,510
It's not funny because his feet were 
bitten off.

1994
01:33:46,511 --> 01:33:51,511
One of his hands was gone.
This bear just fucked him up.

1995
01:33:52,660 --> 01:33:53,493
And uh,
they named the town after him after the 

1996
01:33:56,231 --> 01:33:57,064
guy had died in his honor.
They named this town after the last guy 

1997
01:34:00,910 --> 01:34:03,160
to get killed by a grizzly bear.
So like,

1998
01:34:03,161 --> 01:34:04,420
people that go,
huh?

1999
01:34:04,421 --> 01:34:06,790
You know,
they've ruined California.

2000
01:34:06,791 --> 01:34:09,520
The grizzly bears extinct from 
California,

2001
01:34:09,820 --> 01:34:11,020
listened to me,
listened to me.

2002
01:34:11,710 --> 01:34:16,710
Let Montana have the fucking grizzlies.
You don't want them here.

2003
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:20,620
Just trust me.
I know they seem so romantic.

2004
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:23,950
They seem so lovely when you're on 
television.

2005
01:34:24,130 --> 01:34:26,590
That's great,
and there's a spot for them on earth.

2006
01:34:26,620 --> 01:34:29,530
That's great too,
but this idea of bringing them back like

2007
01:34:29,531 --> 01:34:31,360
what do you want to be one of those 
pioneers.

2008
01:34:31,361 --> 01:34:32,194
It's scared to get to your fucking 
recyclable bin in the middle of the 

2009
01:34:34,420 --> 01:34:35,253
night.
You're terrifying because your 

2010
01:34:36,340 --> 01:34:39,370
neighborhood is filled with bears and 
lions and shit.

2011
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:41,590
The fuck out of here.
That's ridiculous.

2012
01:34:41,680 --> 01:34:42,513
30 foot long.
Crocodiles wandering down your 

2013
01:34:43,781 --> 01:34:45,020
neighborhood.
No,

2014
01:34:45,580 --> 01:34:47,350
no.
Gotta.

2015
01:34:47,470 --> 01:34:48,550
Shoot.
Those things got.

2016
01:34:48,610 --> 01:34:49,443
Dammit.
They found the story of him because it 

2017
01:34:51,641 --> 01:34:53,470
was scary.
It was written into a tree.

2018
01:34:53,740 --> 01:34:55,810
Did you read that one?
Let'S say.

2019
01:34:55,900 --> 01:34:56,950
Whoa,
whoa.

2020
01:34:57,920 --> 01:34:58,753
Let's

2021
01:34:58,870 --> 01:34:59,703
say I'm looking up the story about,
and I keep talking about this 

2022
01:35:01,791 --> 01:35:02,624
inscription written on a tree that was 
found when people were passing through 

2023
01:35:05,571 --> 01:35:09,140
and the 18 fifties low.
Do you think if we didn't have the teddy

2024
01:35:09,141 --> 01:35:12,040
bears as kids,
we would not be so attached to bears.

2025
01:35:12,050 --> 01:35:12,883
Oh,
for sure.

2026
01:35:12,980 --> 01:35:13,671
Well,
that's right.

2027
01:35:13,671 --> 01:35:15,380
There was a story written on the tree.

2028
01:35:15,620 --> 01:35:20,120
I dug him up and his bones were torn 
apart.

2029
01:35:20,740 --> 01:35:21,710
Wow.
Yeah.

2030
01:35:21,860 --> 01:35:25,310
That's exactly what it was.
Now that I refresh my memory,

2031
01:35:25,340 --> 01:35:27,860
I'd forgotten it was written somewhere.
I didn't know it was on a tree.

2032
01:35:27,861 --> 01:35:30,800
I thought it was a note.
That's insane.

2033
01:35:31,640 --> 01:35:32,900
Fuck bears,
dude.

2034
01:35:32,901 --> 01:35:34,310
Seriously,
fuck them.

2035
01:35:35,310 --> 01:35:37,700
And again,
I'm not for eradicating bears,

2036
01:35:37,701 --> 01:35:38,301
ladies.
Gentlemen.

2037
01:35:38,301 --> 01:35:40,070
I just want to be clear.
I love them.

2038
01:35:40,100 --> 01:35:41,720
I'm glad they exist.
They're cool.

2039
01:35:41,750 --> 01:35:45,170
Just like lions are Cool.
I Don't want lions in burbank.

2040
01:35:45,830 --> 01:35:47,930
You know,
I just a whole cecil the lion thing.

2041
01:35:47,960 --> 01:35:50,870
Let's not get carried away folks.
Let's not,

2042
01:35:51,410 --> 01:35:52,243
don't bring them over here.
Don't get crazy because a guy who wants 

2043
01:35:54,531 --> 01:35:58,190
to bring them over to england.
Do you know the guy who is the,

2044
01:35:58,191 --> 01:36:00,290
um,
when bulls created rivers guy,

2045
01:36:01,540 --> 01:36:02,373
the guy with wolves change rivers.
He made this really cool documentary or 

2046
01:36:05,690 --> 01:36:08,590
a video that shows what the.

2047
01:36:08,670 --> 01:36:10,400
It's been criticized.
I don't know who's right,

2048
01:36:10,430 --> 01:36:13,010
but to me it's interesting and it makes 
a lot of really cool points.

2049
01:36:13,250 --> 01:36:14,083
And one of the things was that these 
wolves were reintroduced them to the 

2050
01:36:16,811 --> 01:36:20,480
yellowstone.
They started killing the elk and killing

2051
01:36:20,481 --> 01:36:21,314
the deer.
And that allowed a lot of the plants to 

2052
01:36:23,091 --> 01:36:23,924
grow better,
which allowed a lot of the rivers that 

2053
01:36:25,551 --> 01:36:26,384
changed the course of the rivers because
the root system got stronger and all 

2054
01:36:29,271 --> 01:36:31,580
these other animals survived and 
thrived.

2055
01:36:31,610 --> 01:36:34,640
They all did better because they weren't
the prey of the wolf,

2056
01:36:34,641 --> 01:36:38,120
but they were benefiting from the elk 
and the deer not being around anymore.

2057
01:36:38,510 --> 01:36:39,343
and so a look,
it's really cool to see like how when 

2058
01:36:42,411 --> 01:36:43,244
they introduce a predator into an area,
it's almost like you're watching a 

2059
01:36:47,271 --> 01:36:48,104
mathematical program,
like you introduced this and it's a 

2060
01:36:50,391 --> 01:36:51,224
really controversial subject because a 
lot of elk hunters in particular were 

2061
01:36:55,010 --> 01:36:55,843
really mad when they brought these 
wolves in because they killed half the 

2062
01:36:58,041 --> 01:36:58,850
elk population.

2063
01:36:58,850 --> 01:37:02,210
They chopped them down to 50 percent.
But some people think that it's probably

2064
01:37:02,211 --> 01:37:05,360
overall healthy for the actual animals 
themselves.

2065
01:37:05,361 --> 01:37:06,194
It's like a more honest life.
It's not really honest for these wild 

2066
01:37:10,221 --> 01:37:12,620
cows and undulates to not have any 
predators.

2067
01:37:12,621 --> 01:37:14,270
They've never had that all throughout 
history.

2068
01:37:14,450 --> 01:37:15,283
So our idea that we're going to 
eliminate all the predators and they're 

2069
01:37:17,661 --> 01:37:20,210
just going to run wild.
That's crazy.

2070
01:37:20,240 --> 01:37:21,073
Like that's how you get like Michigan,
where people are fucking hitting him 

2071
01:37:22,851 --> 01:37:25,550
with cars to a tune of a million a year.
Some was it.

2072
01:37:25,551 --> 01:37:28,880
No one was at one point $5 million in 
the whole country for a year.

2073
01:37:28,881 --> 01:37:29,714
Right?
200 people dead from colliding with 

2074
01:37:32,391 --> 01:37:34,070
deer.
You know.

2075
01:37:34,071 --> 01:37:37,010
So like wolves.
Wolves are important.

2076
01:37:37,011 --> 01:37:38,780
Bears are important.
They're interesting.

2077
01:37:38,840 --> 01:37:40,490
They're fucking fascinating,
man.

2078
01:37:40,550 --> 01:37:44,090
I'm so glad they're around,
but don't get crazy.

2079
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:48,250
Don't get fucking to coyotes in my 
neighborhood.

2080
01:37:48,251 --> 01:37:50,160
It's getting out of hand.
And the crows,

2081
01:37:50,570 --> 01:37:51,540
crows and coyotes

2082
01:37:51,770 --> 01:37:53,410
out of control.
I love coyotes,

2083
01:37:53,480 --> 01:37:54,680
man.
I do.

2084
01:37:55,350 --> 01:37:56,190
They're fucking

2085
01:37:56,190 --> 01:37:57,870
cool.
I mean,

2086
01:37:57,960 --> 01:38:01,610
I remember the first time I saw one,
I was staying at the um,

2087
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:06,600
what is those a furnished apartments 
that oakwood's oh no.

2088
01:38:06,601 --> 01:38:09,800
You know the oakwoods everybody gets you
first moved to hollywood.

2089
01:38:10,170 --> 01:38:11,880
I was staying at one of those things,
man.

2090
01:38:11,881 --> 01:38:12,714
I was driving to the apartment and I saw
these fucking dogs running down the 

2091
01:38:15,331 --> 01:38:16,164
street,
like little german shepherds and is the 

2092
01:38:17,641 --> 01:38:19,290
first time I'd ever seen a coyote.
And I realized,

2093
01:38:19,291 --> 01:38:21,660
holy shit,
these are coyotes.

2094
01:38:22,020 --> 01:38:25,110
How weird is this?
He's a little wild predators,

2095
01:38:25,111 --> 01:38:29,220
just small enough that we let them stay 
just small enough.

2096
01:38:29,430 --> 01:38:30,263
If they were hyenas,
we would be gunning them down from the 

2097
01:38:32,371 --> 01:38:33,810
top of buses.
Right?

2098
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:36,930
If he needs a roman down the street 
tearing apart dogs and shit,

2099
01:38:38,100 --> 01:38:38,933
we'd be terrified,
but is just dickie enough to slip under 

2100
01:38:42,451 --> 01:38:44,520
the radar.
I like to eat a cat every now and then.

2101
01:38:44,670 --> 01:38:46,110
Don't leave your cat out,
bro.

2102
01:38:46,410 --> 01:38:49,500
I'm going eat your fucking cat.
We like tolerate that.

2103
01:38:49,501 --> 01:38:53,890
This little predator will eat your dog.
I just snatch youR dog right out of your

2104
01:38:53,891 --> 01:38:55,860
art and hop over the fence with them.
You got to deal with that.

2105
01:38:56,610 --> 01:38:57,443
I saw one kill my chicken saw and saw 
that fucker hop over the fence with my 

2106
01:39:01,681 --> 01:39:04,980
chicken and its mouth,
but I still love them.

2107
01:39:05,910 --> 01:39:06,743
I love them because they're like.
They're like little criminals like 

2108
01:39:09,991 --> 01:39:14,991
skirting the system.
They're scary enough that you don't want

2109
01:39:15,541 --> 01:39:17,720
your kids to be around them,
but you're not scared of him.

2110
01:39:19,090 --> 01:39:21,960
A little skiddish it Probably fuck you 
up if they want it to.

2111
01:39:22,410 --> 01:39:25,650
Like if a coyote really came after,
he'd probably have a real problem.

2112
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:27,840
You probably have a real problem.
It's like a dog,

2113
01:39:27,870 --> 01:39:29,670
right?
It's a lot less sharp teeth.

2114
01:39:29,740 --> 01:39:31,980
Yeah,
but they're more survival oriented.

2115
01:39:32,040 --> 01:39:34,980
They'd be scared if you put up a good 
fight,

2116
01:39:35,490 --> 01:39:38,550
like if you booted a coyote in the head,
if you've got a good roundhouse kick,

2117
01:39:39,120 --> 01:39:41,400
you know,
if feel like a chocolate dell,

2118
01:39:41,550 --> 01:39:42,383
like have a coyote,
tries to fuck with chuck liddell and 

2119
01:39:44,130 --> 01:39:44,963
chuck a duck kicks that fucking thing in
the head that that's how he's going to 

2120
01:39:48,101 --> 01:39:49,380
run.
He's going to go,

2121
01:39:49,381 --> 01:39:50,214
what was that?
Fuck this that's ever happened to me 

2122
01:39:52,441 --> 01:39:53,550
before.
And they'll just take off.

2123
01:39:53,551 --> 01:39:54,900
You know,
if He doesn't knock them unconscious,

2124
01:39:54,901 --> 01:39:59,901
they'll just run and get the fuck away.
But they'll kill you if you're small.

2125
01:40:00,840 --> 01:40:02,730
If you're a little kid,
coyotes will kill you.

2126
01:40:03,470 --> 01:40:03,950
Well,
they don't.

2127
01:40:03,950 --> 01:40:06,270
They don't have any morals.
Like why would they not?

2128
01:40:06,670 --> 01:40:08,790
The only thing they look,
is there people arounD?

2129
01:40:08,820 --> 01:40:10,650
Can I get away with this?
I'm going to do it.

2130
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:12,440
As they do,
they don't have any rules there.

2131
01:40:12,500 --> 01:40:16,290
God damn wild animals.
Remember that 19 year old singer who was

2132
01:40:16,291 --> 01:40:20,220
killed in Canada a few years back?
She's a folk singer,

2133
01:40:20,790 --> 01:40:22,560
she's killed by coyotes.
Really?

2134
01:40:22,620 --> 01:40:25,680
Dude is ugly because they found her.
She was still alive.

2135
01:40:26,040 --> 01:40:27,810
God,
but here's the thing about coyotes,

2136
01:40:27,811 --> 01:40:28,650
dude,
they start eating.

2137
01:40:28,651 --> 01:40:30,000
You asked first.
Oh,

2138
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:32,700
that's right.
I remember that.

2139
01:40:32,701 --> 01:40:33,534
Do you have any idea how horrific it 
must be for a coyote to pull your guts 

2140
01:40:37,291 --> 01:40:38,124
out through your asshole while you're 
screaming and no one can hear you and 

2141
01:40:42,601 --> 01:40:45,150
you're in the woods?
That is a demon.

2142
01:40:45,390 --> 01:40:49,010
It's Just a demon that only attacks 
occasionally if coyote,

2143
01:40:49,011 --> 01:40:49,844
he's wearing a real thing and there was 
a murder where a demon from hell came 

2144
01:40:53,410 --> 01:40:58,410
out of the ground and ate a 19 year old 
aspiring folk singer through her asshole

2145
01:40:59,320 --> 01:41:01,210
eight.
Her ripped her guts Out,

2146
01:41:01,211 --> 01:41:02,044
tore apart,
and then the demon just disappeared and 

2147
01:41:03,791 --> 01:41:06,330
went into space and we knew that he was 
gonna.

2148
01:41:06,350 --> 01:41:09,190
Come back in 30 years,
that town would live in terror,

2149
01:41:11,050 --> 01:41:15,100
lIve in terror of the possibility of 
something they could commit that kind of

2150
01:41:15,101 --> 01:41:18,520
enact would return like you'll be 
looming over us.

2151
01:41:18,521 --> 01:41:20,860
We'd prepare,
we'd have armor and shit.

2152
01:41:20,861 --> 01:41:23,640
Be waiting for the thirtY years to come.
Meanwhile,

2153
01:41:23,650 --> 01:41:25,570
they're outside,
checking out your mail.

2154
01:41:26,320 --> 01:41:28,240
They're sniffing around your garbage 
cans,

2155
01:41:28,890 --> 01:41:30,260
tick either nails,
click,

2156
01:41:30,261 --> 01:41:30,651
click,
click,

2157
01:41:30,651 --> 01:41:31,011
click,
click,

2158
01:41:31,011 --> 01:41:31,844
click.
My security camera gets in once in 

2159
01:41:32,651 --> 01:41:33,670
awhile.
Of couRse it does.

2160
01:41:34,600 --> 01:41:35,680
Of course it does,
man.

2161
01:41:36,210 --> 01:41:37,270
Yeah,
they're everywhere.

2162
01:41:37,690 --> 01:41:39,880
They're everywhere.
I'm having a guy come on soon.

2163
01:41:40,150 --> 01:41:44,230
That is a a wildlife biologist that 
studying.

2164
01:41:44,231 --> 01:41:45,064
We're trying to coordinate a date.
He's studying coyotes that live in the 

2165
01:41:48,551 --> 01:41:49,384
city and surprisingly like healthy 
populations of coyotes that live in the 

2166
01:41:54,971 --> 01:41:56,530
city.
It's crazy.

2167
01:41:56,590 --> 01:41:57,460
Yeah,
there's a lot of them,

2168
01:41:57,461 --> 01:41:58,240
man.
They just.

2169
01:41:58,240 --> 01:41:59,073
They find places where they can sleep.
They find find places where no one's 

2170
01:42:01,481 --> 01:42:02,314
going to fuck with them and then that's 
their spot and then they venture out at 

2171
01:42:05,021 --> 01:42:05,854
night or venture out at dusk or they're 
and they've just figured out a way in a 

2172
01:42:10,061 --> 01:42:10,420
fucking.

2173
01:42:10,420 --> 01:42:13,270
AvoId people bothering them,
but they live in cities.

2174
01:42:13,271 --> 01:42:14,890
Man,
it's weird.

2175
01:42:14,970 --> 01:42:17,200
Everybody just gets out of their car.
They get into their house,

2176
01:42:17,380 --> 01:42:19,900
getting your car drive off to work.
You'd go down here,

2177
01:42:19,901 --> 01:42:20,734
you go on there.
How often you check in that weird 

2178
01:42:21,701 --> 01:42:25,180
alleyway behind your apartment building?
How often you check in that place?

2179
01:42:25,181 --> 01:42:26,770
Is anybody checking that place?
You know,

2180
01:42:26,771 --> 01:42:27,604
there's like trees back there for no 
reason and then behind that there's a 

2181
01:42:29,681 --> 01:42:32,800
fence you ever go look in.
There were coyotes live motherfucker.

2182
01:42:32,801 --> 01:42:34,330
If you don't go there for a certain 
amount of time,

2183
01:42:34,331 --> 01:42:35,164
they find that spot.
They sniff around like these dumb fucks 

2184
01:42:37,541 --> 01:42:39,370
don't come here anymore and they'll 
just,

2185
01:42:39,430 --> 01:42:42,070
they'll use that and they find these 
spots all around the city.

2186
01:42:42,071 --> 01:42:47,071
Apparently it's pretty cool to.
So like a weird animal that's just small

2187
01:42:49,551 --> 01:42:52,700
enough that will let it hunt near us.

2188
01:42:55,590 --> 01:42:56,423
I wish it was.
There was foxes more foxes around boxes 

2189
01:42:58,650 --> 01:42:59,483
are pretty dope.
Did you say you see that video with the 

2190
01:43:00,751 --> 01:43:02,640
fox laughing like,
oh,

2191
01:43:02,840 --> 01:43:04,940
this guy I guess has a fox.
Oh,

2192
01:43:05,140 --> 01:43:06,390
pet fox.
Pet fox.

2193
01:43:06,570 --> 01:43:09,000
And the guy just be like,
ha ha.

2194
01:43:09,020 --> 01:43:10,010
And the fox just goes.

2195
01:43:10,910 --> 01:43:11,310
Yeah.

2196
01:43:11,310 --> 01:43:13,260
Like it's just like,
it's so weirD.

2197
01:43:13,261 --> 01:43:14,980
Such a weird video.
Yeah,

2198
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:17,340
box.
It's a pet.

2199
01:43:17,910 --> 01:43:19,560
Yeah.
It's got a collar on and everything.

2200
01:43:19,561 --> 01:43:20,200
That's a far.

2201
01:43:20,200 --> 01:43:21,033
Yeah.
And look at.

2202
01:43:22,420 --> 01:43:23,770
Oh my god.

2203
01:43:23,960 --> 01:43:26,210
Laughing.
Whoa.

2204
01:43:28,590 --> 01:43:31,470
That's a hilarious sound.
It rolls over at fox,

2205
01:43:31,471 --> 01:43:34,470
probably so happy.
He's inside a house getting free food.

2206
01:43:34,471 --> 01:43:38,110
You just have to go out there and earn 
fox.

2207
01:43:38,610 --> 01:43:40,010
Do you ever see the video,
uh,

2208
01:43:40,011 --> 01:43:40,844
of the fox with a grizzly man when 
grizzly man was up in the woods and the 

2209
01:43:46,141 --> 01:43:47,770
fox and him became buddies?
Yeah,

2210
01:43:47,820 --> 01:43:51,150
it's really beautiful footage.
I think honestly,

2211
01:43:51,350 --> 01:43:52,100
I know I make fun

2212
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:52,933
of that movie a lot because that guy was
out of his fucking mind and that's 

2213
01:43:56,091 --> 01:43:56,924
another unintentional comedy.
This is another perfect example of 

2214
01:43:59,601 --> 01:44:01,070
something that's not supposed to be 
funny,

2215
01:44:01,190 --> 01:44:02,023
but it's god damned hilarious and no 
disrespect to this guy who got eaten by 

2216
01:44:05,601 --> 01:44:06,434
the bear.
No disrespect because I think he really 

2217
01:44:08,811 --> 01:44:09,644
did do a lot of great stuff.
I think he was a little delusional with 

2218
01:44:12,291 --> 01:44:15,860
his idea that he was saving these bears,
but what he did do,

2219
01:44:16,010 --> 01:44:16,843
his got amazing,
incredible up close footage of grizzly 

2220
01:44:21,021 --> 01:44:24,260
bears involved in all sorts of crazy 
shit.

2221
01:44:24,261 --> 01:44:25,094
Like he,
he captured grizzly bear wars at like 

2222
01:44:27,950 --> 01:44:28,783
really close range and he did a great 
job and he deVeloped friendships with 

2223
01:44:34,641 --> 01:44:36,740
these animals.
Like this little fox right here.

2224
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:40,310
This fox just comes right up to him,
man is hanging out with him.

2225
01:44:40,640 --> 01:44:41,473
AT one point it steals his hat and 
playfully runs off with it and he's 

2226
01:44:45,411 --> 01:44:45,861
like,
hey,

2227
01:44:45,861 --> 01:44:48,740
give me that hat back and the fucking.
The fox isn't scared of a man.

2228
01:44:49,010 --> 01:44:52,370
The fox just thinks it's funny.
Like why would the fox take the hat?

2229
01:44:53,090 --> 01:44:55,220
He just rolling around and they're 
biting on it.

2230
01:44:55,221 --> 01:44:58,310
It's really adorable and the grizzly man
gets mad,

2231
01:44:58,520 --> 01:45:01,290
so he goes chasing after the fox and

2232
01:45:01,930 --> 01:45:02,763
it was just like weird moment of 
camaraderie between two life forms that 

2233
01:45:07,091 --> 01:45:11,970
are just hanging out in the woods 
together.

2234
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,490
Like that thing accepted him into its 
community.

2235
01:45:14,491 --> 01:45:16,110
Man.
It's really interesting.

2236
01:45:16,920 --> 01:45:17,753
Another interesting thing is the wolves 
killed one of those boxes while he was 

2237
01:45:20,581 --> 01:45:24,240
there already.
They got ahold of that fox torn apart.

2238
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:28,740
They don't want any competing predators.
Same with coyotes.

2239
01:45:29,250 --> 01:45:30,550
Coyotes,
coyotes.

2240
01:45:31,300 --> 01:45:33,630
Same with coyotes.
They don't want competing predators.

2241
01:45:33,750 --> 01:45:36,120
That's apparently the main reason why 
they kill cats.

2242
01:45:36,570 --> 01:45:37,403
They don't even kill them to eat them as
much as they kill them because they 

2243
01:45:39,091 --> 01:45:39,924
don't want any predators that are 
competing for the same things they're 

2244
01:45:42,240 --> 01:45:43,073
competing for.

2245
01:45:45,960 --> 01:45:46,793
So,
so he got this amazing footage of him 

2246
01:45:47,971 --> 01:45:50,940
like running after this fox hanging out 
with his fox.

2247
01:45:51,190 --> 01:45:52,023
He was like buddies with this little fox
and then when the fox kid got eaten by 

2248
01:45:55,201 --> 01:45:58,290
the wolf,
he found like a paul and you're like,

2249
01:45:58,291 --> 01:46:01,950
whoa,
this world is gangster.

2250
01:46:02,220 --> 01:46:07,220
Like these little crazy animals make 
friends with this nutty guy who's camped

2251
01:46:07,501 --> 01:46:10,830
out in a tent and while he's camped on 
that tent in the middle of the night,

2252
01:46:10,831 --> 01:46:15,510
the wolves come into town and tear one 
of those boxes apart and he's crying and

2253
01:46:15,511 --> 01:46:16,740
he said,
I heard the screams.

2254
01:46:16,741 --> 01:46:18,870
I heard the howls.
I heard the wolves.

2255
01:46:19,110 --> 01:46:21,120
I'm like,
what in the fuck are you live in through

2256
01:46:21,121 --> 01:46:21,954
dude?
Like there you have in monster wars and 

2257
01:46:23,461 --> 01:46:24,294
your yard.

2258
01:46:25,250 --> 01:46:29,390
LiTerally watched that movie.
I don't know where these parts are.

2259
01:46:29,540 --> 01:46:30,830
So good.
Fox a little,

2260
01:46:30,831 --> 01:46:35,420
but I've seen it way too many times.
I've seen that fucking movie

2261
01:46:36,730 --> 01:46:37,563
15 times.
I watched it on planes and I'm bored if 

2262
01:46:40,661 --> 01:46:41,494
I'm bored

2263
01:46:41,750 --> 01:46:43,880
again.
Did you,

2264
01:46:44,540 --> 01:46:45,373
did you see that report that there's 
like 1300 chinese old ladies or old 

2265
01:46:50,371 --> 01:46:51,204
people get go missing every day?
Like there's this whole thing where the 

2266
01:46:54,821 --> 01:46:59,240
old people just are missing like daily 
1300 chinese.

2267
01:46:59,650 --> 01:47:01,080
Wait a minute.
This is recent.

2268
01:47:01,110 --> 01:47:01,943
Yeah,
and then they're saying it's up to 

2269
01:47:03,481 --> 01:47:04,314
500,000
old women go ms dot or old people go 

2270
01:47:07,081 --> 01:47:07,914
missing every year in China and so 
there's all these theories like that 

2271
01:47:11,010 --> 01:47:11,843
they become food and in the government 
takes them because it costs so much 

2272
01:47:15,181 --> 01:47:17,010
money.
Oh no,

2273
01:47:18,570 --> 01:47:21,380
that's a lot.
And I know $500.

2274
01:47:21,400 --> 01:47:24,100
Mark and old people.
500,000.

2275
01:47:24,290 --> 01:47:25,410
Okay.
How many,

2276
01:47:25,470 --> 01:47:26,303
how many people go missing in America 
every year from the old people go 

2277
01:47:30,211 --> 01:47:32,910
missing in America year?
See there's a difference,

2278
01:47:33,390 --> 01:47:36,180
but I think $500,000
seems like a lot,

2279
01:47:36,330 --> 01:47:40,020
but China has a billion in China.
It's 80 percent.

2280
01:47:40,290 --> 01:47:42,570
Eighty percent of what people are 
missing people.

2281
01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:45,190
Eighty percent of missing.
Yeah.

2282
01:47:45,750 --> 01:47:47,400
Yeah.
Over 75.

2283
01:47:52,830 --> 01:47:54,120
Oh my god.
They're killing all people.

2284
01:47:54,270 --> 01:47:56,040
That's what I'm saying.
Oh my god,

2285
01:47:57,240 --> 01:47:59,460
they killed babies and older people.
Oh my god.

2286
01:47:59,461 --> 01:48:01,500
That's so insane.
On average in the usa,

2287
01:48:01,501 --> 01:48:04,950
there's only $90,000
missing persons at any given time.

2288
01:48:05,070 --> 01:48:06,220
Okay.
$90,000

2289
01:48:06,221 --> 01:48:08,580
missing persons,
but in their defense,

2290
01:48:08,610 --> 01:48:13,610
China has probably three plus times more
people than we do,

2291
01:48:15,540 --> 01:48:18,450
so wouldn't.
Shouldn't still be under 300,000

2292
01:48:18,451 --> 01:48:20,160
if that was the.
But that's close.

2293
01:48:20,670 --> 01:48:21,503
That's close.
And you considered the fact that they 

2294
01:48:22,591 --> 01:48:25,180
live in a really rural place in a lot 
of.

2295
01:48:25,220 --> 01:48:27,930
A lot of the errors are very rural.
Do they have predators?

2296
01:48:27,931 --> 01:48:28,830
They have bears,
right?

2297
01:48:28,860 --> 01:48:31,350
China has some bears.
What else did they have?

2298
01:48:31,920 --> 01:48:33,300
What kind of credit?
What hate?

2299
01:48:33,420 --> 01:48:34,253
Hey google.
What kind of shit eats people in China 

2300
01:48:37,840 --> 01:48:40,200
and they'll say chinese people.
Chinese.

2301
01:48:40,590 --> 01:48:43,760
It's just the infinity sign.
Just a few animals.

2302
01:48:43,880 --> 01:48:45,600
It's very aware,
but we've got a few guys.

2303
01:48:46,740 --> 01:48:48,790
That would be a weird thing to find out 
how many people in America,

2304
01:48:48,791 --> 01:48:51,460
he and people right now and if America 
has 90,000

2305
01:48:51,480 --> 01:48:54,420
missing people or how percent of that is
old people?

2306
01:48:54,421 --> 01:48:56,460
Probably only like small amount.
What do you,

2307
01:48:56,461 --> 01:48:57,480
what are you googling here,
buddy?

2308
01:48:58,570 --> 01:49:03,400
Get exactly what you still kind of weird
shit meets people in China to meet me.

2309
01:49:06,290 --> 01:49:11,130
I was being silly.
You should actually go google.

2310
01:49:11,910 --> 01:49:14,400
That's hilarious.
Creditors of humans in China.

2311
01:49:15,090 --> 01:49:17,880
Sorry,
I had to be more specific for ladies and

2312
01:49:17,881 --> 01:49:19,440
gentlemen.
Just want tO announce right now.

2313
01:49:19,441 --> 01:49:22,890
We were way too high to start this 
podcast when we did.

2314
01:49:23,400 --> 01:49:23,970
So.
Uh,

2315
01:49:23,970 --> 01:49:26,310
thanks for hanging in there.
We've come back around.

2316
01:49:26,700 --> 01:49:31,700
everybody's okay now.
Do they have predators?

2317
01:49:32,431 --> 01:49:35,060
Is there maybe the old ladies get 
scooped up by tara.

2318
01:49:35,250 --> 01:49:38,080
Those are some shit.
Pterodactyls were real.

2319
01:49:38,400 --> 01:49:41,010
Shoot them out of the sky.
You can't be an alligator that can fly.

2320
01:49:41,340 --> 01:49:42,090
Right?
Right.

2321
01:49:42,090 --> 01:49:42,923
Agreed,
right?

2322
01:49:42,990 --> 01:49:43,823
Yeah.
You could crawl around on the golf 

2323
01:49:44,791 --> 01:49:45,241
course.
I'm like,

2324
01:49:45,241 --> 01:49:46,260
ah,
leT that slide.

2325
01:49:46,620 --> 01:49:48,000
As soon as they can fly.
Fuck

2326
01:49:48,030 --> 01:49:48,720
you.
Fuck.

2327
01:49:48,720 --> 01:49:51,220
You can't just land in my yard.
You piece of shit.

2328
01:49:51,340 --> 01:49:53,470
and then what?
You can fly away and I can't fly.

2329
01:49:53,500 --> 01:49:54,333
Fuck you.
Is there anything that flies right now 

2330
01:49:56,201 --> 01:49:58,810
that attacks people?
See that's the thing about eagles.

2331
01:49:58,870 --> 01:49:59,703
Eagles got smart.
They never got big enough to fuck with 

2332
01:50:01,301 --> 01:50:02,320
us,
so we said,

2333
01:50:02,321 --> 01:50:04,090
all right,
we'll let you be our national bird.

2334
01:50:04,720 --> 01:50:07,990
He eagles got really close.
They got scary.

2335
01:50:08,110 --> 01:50:08,943
I mean,
if you see an eagle and you see those 

2336
01:50:09,641 --> 01:50:11,530
towns and shit,
they'll freak you out.

2337
01:50:11,720 --> 01:50:16,720
I get attacked by birds a lot recently.
I think I just must be near ness.

2338
01:50:17,950 --> 01:50:20,800
You don't be doing that.
I just like sitting in my backyard.

2339
01:50:21,100 --> 01:50:21,791
What do you,
uh,

2340
01:50:21,791 --> 01:50:22,624
what do you got here?
James is just a wildlife with China on 

2341
01:50:24,461 --> 01:50:26,170
wikipedia.
There's a different mammals.

2342
01:50:26,171 --> 01:50:29,160
Does it say predators of humans?
Did you have predators?

2343
01:50:29,830 --> 01:50:31,120
They have giant tiger's.
Oh,

2344
01:50:31,121 --> 01:50:31,871
they do?
Well,

2345
01:50:31,871 --> 01:50:33,850
that's it.
Old people getting eaten by tigers.

2346
01:50:33,880 --> 01:50:35,110
There you go.
In it.

2347
01:50:35,230 --> 01:50:38,970
What if we find out south China tiger 
said,

2348
01:50:39,880 --> 01:50:42,670
toilet chinese people are sewing.
Figured.

2349
01:50:43,140 --> 01:50:44,580
Oh my god.
And they're like,

2350
01:50:44,590 --> 01:50:48,580
we told you it was in the fucking dumb 
piece of shit.

2351
01:50:50,440 --> 01:50:51,970
Oh my god.
They have siberian tigers.

2352
01:50:51,971 --> 01:50:53,390
Oh,
they have a bunch of other cats to it.

2353
01:50:53,391 --> 01:50:55,540
What does that population of bengal 
tigers.

2354
01:50:55,990 --> 01:50:57,820
What are those things?
Those other cats?

2355
01:50:57,900 --> 01:51:00,340
Laptop leopards.
Leopards are terrifying.

2356
01:51:00,490 --> 01:51:04,390
So this is what I think since they have 
a bunch of shit that we don't have,

2357
01:51:04,391 --> 01:51:05,224
they can kill you.
My estimation is that poor 

2358
01:51:07,481 --> 01:51:10,510
communication,
a lack of resources.

2359
01:51:11,050 --> 01:51:11,883
I'm very rural.
Neighborhoods connected to tigers and 

2360
01:51:14,681 --> 01:51:15,514
cats are causing the extra 200,000
that would account for them having the 

2361
01:51:19,901 --> 01:51:22,690
exact same amount of old people go 
missing as we do.

2362
01:51:22,900 --> 01:51:25,300
Said 25 percent of those old people have
dementia.

2363
01:51:25,480 --> 01:51:25,991
Oh,
There you go.

2364
01:51:25,991 --> 01:51:27,460
You wander off.
You get eaten by the tiger.

2365
01:51:28,510 --> 01:51:30,820
I forget.
What am I not supposed to get eaten by a

2366
01:51:30,850 --> 01:51:31,780
tree?
No.

2367
01:51:32,320 --> 01:51:33,153
Did you see that video?
That chinese person eating the other on 

2368
01:51:35,621 --> 01:51:37,150
the subway?
Like cannibalism.

2369
01:51:37,710 --> 01:51:39,140
What?
Yeah,

2370
01:51:39,580 --> 01:51:40,413
what?
Maybe just say asian and maybe it's not 

2371
01:51:43,721 --> 01:51:45,490
in good.
Let's not show him for sure.

2372
01:51:45,910 --> 01:51:46,743
Well you can't really see anythIng.
You just see a guy hunched over another 

2373
01:51:48,641 --> 01:51:51,320
guy and he just blood coming out.
So he attacks the dot.

2374
01:51:51,330 --> 01:51:52,330
Yeah.
Is that real?

2375
01:51:52,331 --> 01:51:53,920
It's happened a few times.
It's happened.

2376
01:51:53,921 --> 01:51:55,270
Like there's more than one real.
Yeah.

2377
01:51:55,271 --> 01:51:58,690
There's more than one video attacking.
He's attacking some other guy.

2378
01:51:58,691 --> 01:52:00,580
Oh my god.
Is that all blood?

2379
01:52:00,581 --> 01:52:02,590
Yes.
What did he attack them with?

2380
01:52:02,710 --> 01:52:04,300
He's with his mouth.
He's eating him.

2381
01:52:04,390 --> 01:52:05,223
Oh my god,
there's more than one of these videos 

2382
01:52:07,711 --> 01:52:11,720
and this guy I know and there's more 
than one of these videos to.

2383
01:52:11,770 --> 01:52:14,920
You would let that go on and it get on.
But I mean like,

2384
01:52:15,690 --> 01:52:17,010
oh my god,
I don't know.

2385
01:52:17,340 --> 01:52:19,980
You have how many people know?
But I know I can't do shit.

2386
01:52:20,130 --> 01:52:21,430
I would,
I would faint.

2387
01:52:23,140 --> 01:52:25,060
Killed the fuck out of that guy if I 
could.

2388
01:52:25,950 --> 01:52:26,783
You'd have to worry that he's going to 
go after you next or your kid or your 

2389
01:52:28,991 --> 01:52:30,660
friend or your bite.
Shit.

2390
01:52:30,661 --> 01:52:31,494
You're fucked too.
And that's the subway in China by the 

2391
01:52:32,621 --> 01:52:33,454
way.
And there's more than one of these 

2392
01:52:33,971 --> 01:52:37,020
cannibalism videos.
Like there's China on subways,

2393
01:52:37,030 --> 01:52:39,100
there's this.
I don't know what happens,

2394
01:52:39,101 --> 01:52:39,934
but there's a lot of this happening.
This is a bunch of videos of people 

2395
01:52:43,001 --> 01:52:45,260
randomly attacking people on subways or 
something.

2396
01:52:45,440 --> 01:52:46,310
We were just watching.

2397
01:52:46,340 --> 01:52:46,911
Well,
here's the thing,

2398
01:52:46,911 --> 01:52:47,744
when you're some about being contained 
in a subway where you're in this thing 

2399
01:52:51,470 --> 01:52:53,900
or you know,
like it's a container and you know,

2400
01:52:53,901 --> 01:52:54,734
nobody can get away.
There's some weird instinct that people 

2401
01:52:57,591 --> 01:53:00,350
have where like if someone was like a 
predator already,

2402
01:53:00,680 --> 01:53:01,513
I bet they would be in that thing and it
would like excite their predator 

2403
01:53:04,281 --> 01:53:05,680
desIres,
you know,

2404
01:53:05,690 --> 01:53:06,523
if somebody just with some crazy person 
that wanted to go on a subway and just 

2405
01:53:09,891 --> 01:53:12,970
beat the shit out of somebody,
like if they're there in the.

2406
01:53:13,040 --> 01:53:14,450
We all know there's people like that in 
the world,

2407
01:53:14,451 --> 01:53:15,284
right?
They just want to go and hurt somebody 

2408
01:53:16,641 --> 01:53:18,590
for whatever reason.
that's the place to do it.

2409
01:53:18,591 --> 01:53:19,580
Right?
Trapped.

2410
01:53:20,240 --> 01:53:22,250
You want to eat somebody,
subways the move.

2411
01:53:22,340 --> 01:53:25,640
And I think a lot of schizophrenia,
people blowing like pcp,

2412
01:53:26,210 --> 01:53:28,030
it freaks them out more and more.
And,

2413
01:53:28,100 --> 01:53:29,500
and they,
they're like,

2414
01:53:29,501 --> 01:53:30,334
they can't just like they get there,
they feel like they're in a confined 

2415
01:53:32,991 --> 01:53:34,010
space,
that they freak out,

2416
01:53:34,050 --> 01:53:34,810
you know,
they,

2417
01:53:34,810 --> 01:53:39,210
they attack or I guess that cop that 
shot or the.

2418
01:53:39,290 --> 01:53:40,850
Remember the guy that recently,
he got shot,

2419
01:53:40,851 --> 01:53:43,130
I guess like,
I had pcp in his system.

2420
01:53:43,190 --> 01:53:44,023
So says so says.
So it says who Alex Jones did you see 

2421
01:53:47,121 --> 01:53:48,000
Alex Jones?
Uh,

2422
01:53:48,060 --> 01:53:51,470
let's stay on one subject at a time.
Fucking ocd.

2423
01:53:51,560 --> 01:53:52,850
Add,
fuck,

2424
01:53:53,660 --> 01:53:55,840
this guy had pcp in his system.
Yeah.

2425
01:53:55,841 --> 01:53:58,070
That one.
The girl cop that shot magic

2426
01:53:58,220 --> 01:54:00,710
fake that he didn't have any pcp and 
system.

2427
01:54:00,740 --> 01:54:04,400
RIght.
Like a who's checking that shit?

2428
01:54:04,490 --> 01:54:05,121
Where,
where,

2429
01:54:05,121 --> 01:54:05,954
where that happened.
Wasn't it like North Carolina or some 

2430
01:54:07,071 --> 01:54:08,150
shit.
Texas.

2431
01:54:08,710 --> 01:54:11,060
where was that?
Huh?

2432
01:54:12,470 --> 01:54:13,550
Tulsa.
Oklahoma.

2433
01:54:13,960 --> 01:54:17,570
Yeah.
They faked that mendez pcp in Oklahoma.

2434
01:54:17,630 --> 01:54:19,050
They rigged that.
Uh,

2435
01:54:19,090 --> 01:54:19,790
let me,
maybe.

2436
01:54:19,790 --> 01:54:20,900
Maybe he did.
Maybe.

2437
01:54:20,910 --> 01:54:23,780
Maybe that makes sense.
Like even if he wasn't threatening,

2438
01:54:23,810 --> 01:54:25,910
maybe that makes sense why he wasn't 
listening.

2439
01:54:26,120 --> 01:54:29,030
Why walked back to his car and reached 
into his door.

2440
01:54:29,090 --> 01:54:32,240
Like maybe he was fucked up on pcp.
It totally makes sense.

2441
01:54:34,220 --> 01:54:35,053
Yeah.
Well she shot him apparently what I've 

2442
01:54:36,351 --> 01:54:39,310
understood by people that are around,
um,

2443
01:54:39,550 --> 01:54:40,383
a law enforcement and tactical 
situations when people don't have 

2444
01:54:44,630 --> 01:54:49,160
triggered discipline and they haven't 
been in a firefight before.

2445
01:54:49,161 --> 01:54:49,994
Any kind of situation where your 
adrenaline is jacked and you're really 

2446
01:54:53,031 --> 01:54:55,580
scared for your life and she might have 
been in some before,

2447
01:54:55,730 --> 01:54:58,940
which may be even,
could exacerbate that and jack it up.

2448
01:54:59,420 --> 01:55:02,900
But her adrenaline was jack.
She was shitting her pants.

2449
01:55:02,901 --> 01:55:03,734
Dude wasn't listening and then they 
tased the guy and the my friend justin 

2450
01:55:08,601 --> 01:55:09,434
said to me,
what most lIkely happened is when they 

2451
01:55:12,081 --> 01:55:14,660
tase the guy,
she freaked out and pulled the trigger.

2452
01:55:14,690 --> 01:55:17,360
Absolutely because It's loud.
It's a loud popping noise.

2453
01:55:18,050 --> 01:55:18,883
Somebody.
I think what he's saying is that she 

2454
01:55:21,741 --> 01:55:25,280
didn't even mean to shoot this guy and 
that what happened with her was she just

2455
01:55:25,281 --> 01:55:27,920
didn't have good trigger discipline and 
she freaked out because,

2456
01:55:28,460 --> 01:55:28,911
you know,
man,

2457
01:55:28,911 --> 01:55:32,630
if you've never been in a life or death 
situation with a giant dude who might be

2458
01:55:32,631 --> 01:55:35,570
on pcp or might be on something and he's
not listening,

2459
01:55:35,760 --> 01:55:38,490
pcp scary and there's many videos you're
going to watch guy.

2460
01:55:38,491 --> 01:55:40,770
I'm pcp and mcdonald's,
you know,

2461
01:55:41,160 --> 01:55:41,993
battling cops and stuff like that and he
gets tased a million times and nothing 

2462
01:55:45,151 --> 01:55:46,210
happens.
yeah,

2463
01:55:46,230 --> 01:55:47,520
dude,
you got to be careful.

2464
01:55:48,210 --> 01:55:50,160
Pcp people,
they feel pain different.

2465
01:55:50,540 --> 01:55:51,373
This,
this cop in Texas the other day just 

2466
01:55:52,801 --> 01:55:55,830
tase somebody on a highway and almost 
got hit by a truck.

2467
01:55:56,630 --> 01:55:57,463
They were chasing this guy and this guy 
starts running through this highway and 

2468
01:56:00,660 --> 01:56:05,660
so they cop tasers on the guy falls and 
just misses like a truck by like an inch

2469
01:56:06,020 --> 01:56:06,853
it cars like who?
Why would you take somebody while 

2470
01:56:08,461 --> 01:56:13,080
running on a highway while cars because 
you don't give a fuck bitch,

2471
01:56:13,560 --> 01:56:16,080
but depends on what the dude did.
What if the dude was raping kids?

2472
01:56:16,081 --> 01:56:16,801
True.
Perfect.

2473
01:56:16,801 --> 01:56:17,860
Taze,
rIght?

2474
01:56:17,970 --> 01:56:18,803
It's all legit.
It depends on like if the guy was 

2475
01:56:19,981 --> 01:56:21,480
growing weed,
that's ridiculous,

2476
01:56:21,990 --> 01:56:24,120
right?
We need to find out what his crime was,

2477
01:56:24,150 --> 01:56:27,810
but there's also a helicopter on you,
so maybe let the guy cross the road will

2478
01:56:27,840 --> 01:56:29,610
get you on.
Understand we don't get them.

2479
01:56:29,700 --> 01:56:30,533
We don't.
We don't get him and he's out there 

2480
01:56:30,870 --> 01:56:33,750
fucking kids.
What if it's like spiderman?

2481
01:56:34,040 --> 01:56:36,270
If you don't get them.
This is craziness.

2482
01:56:36,271 --> 01:56:38,460
I mean,
Peter Parker member,

2483
01:56:38,461 --> 01:56:40,890
he led his dad,
go or lead to his uncle.

2484
01:56:40,980 --> 01:56:43,170
He let the guy passes uncle and the guy 
wound up.

2485
01:56:43,200 --> 01:56:44,430
LeT me see how they do this.
Bam.

2486
01:56:47,270 --> 01:56:49,570
Oh,
oh yes.

2487
01:56:49,610 --> 01:56:53,610
I go on there like stock cars.
Oh my god.

2488
01:56:53,611 --> 01:56:54,444
He tased him in the middle of the lane 
on the highway and if you go back 30 

2489
01:56:57,841 --> 01:56:59,190
seconds when he first jumped on the 
highway,

2490
01:56:59,191 --> 01:57:01,160
he almost gets hit like three times.
So like,

2491
01:57:01,161 --> 01:57:02,930
it's ridiculous,
you know?

2492
01:57:03,590 --> 01:57:05,250
Did you know that you could,

2493
01:57:07,120 --> 01:57:09,360
you could pay someone for that far away.
Look,

2494
01:57:09,361 --> 01:57:10,194
look How far he does this for me.
It's the ones that shoot out those 

2495
01:57:11,801 --> 01:57:12,960
three.
Yeah,

2496
01:57:13,110 --> 01:57:14,470
that's pretty good.
That's accurate.

2497
01:57:14,471 --> 01:57:15,910
Hit.
Damn.

2498
01:57:15,911 --> 01:57:17,080
That's under pressure.
That's good.

2499
01:57:17,140 --> 01:57:22,060
True discipline control accuracy is in 
check.

2500
01:57:23,230 --> 01:57:27,730
I found a taser in my car recently and 
it's scary to you turn on.

2501
01:57:27,970 --> 01:57:28,631
See,
here's the thing.

2502
01:57:28,631 --> 01:57:32,340
Then even if that dude was on pcp,
she shouldn't have shot him by.

2503
01:57:32,440 --> 01:57:33,273
It doesn't make it any different.
It's just sort of explains his weird 

2504
01:57:34,961 --> 01:57:36,940
behavior.
[inaudible] she made a mistake,

2505
01:57:37,760 --> 01:57:38,593
but it's a,
it's a mistake that cost somebody their 

2506
01:57:40,121 --> 01:57:40,954
life,
but it's also like the whole thing is 

2507
01:57:42,971 --> 01:57:43,804
kind of fucked up man.
Having a girl in that kind of a 

2508
01:57:47,040 --> 01:57:47,873
situation.
I don't know what kind of training she 

2509
01:57:49,121 --> 01:57:51,070
had or how long she had been on the job.
Do you know?

2510
01:57:51,490 --> 01:57:54,100
Five,
five years.

2511
01:57:54,910 --> 01:57:57,010
Let's make some shit up.
Five decades.

2512
01:57:57,070 --> 01:58:01,570
I want to say it was 52 and 50 of those 
years were on the force.

2513
01:58:04,720 --> 01:58:05,553
I just think it's fucking terribly hard 
to do and we don't get mad if somebody 

2514
01:58:08,501 --> 01:58:10,330
fucks up your fries.
You know,

2515
01:58:10,331 --> 01:58:13,150
if you go to mcdonald's and you got 
burnt fries,

2516
01:58:13,151 --> 01:58:17,920
like each guys fucked the fries up.
This is the equivalent in her job.

2517
01:58:17,980 --> 01:58:20,500
Fucking up the fries.
Somebody dies.

2518
01:58:20,560 --> 01:58:22,180
She made a mistake.
She screwed up.

2519
01:58:23,440 --> 01:58:24,273
Somebody got shot and kill that.
It's so much different than any other 

2520
01:58:27,041 --> 01:58:28,780
job.
It's so crazy.

2521
01:58:30,120 --> 01:58:30,953
I,
I believed that it probably is exactly 

2522
01:58:32,831 --> 01:58:36,940
the sound of the taser in her being in a
high stress that makes complete sense to

2523
01:58:36,941 --> 01:58:37,600
me.
I mean,

2524
01:58:37,600 --> 01:58:42,160
I think you just react by hearing the 
sound and my buddy justin

2525
01:58:42,160 --> 01:58:44,920
would definitely know because he's,
he's down with all those.

2526
01:58:44,921 --> 01:58:47,890
A tactical guys and military guys and 
he's a,

2527
01:58:47,891 --> 01:58:50,290
he's a gun nut so constantly around 
those dudes.

2528
01:58:50,590 --> 01:58:52,840
So if that's what they're saying,
that's most likely what happened.

2529
01:58:52,900 --> 01:58:53,733
It's probably what she relayed and 
private or what they figured out or who 

2530
01:58:56,921 --> 01:58:59,260
knows,
but and fuck,

2531
01:58:59,290 --> 01:59:00,123
fuck that job.
Imagine just chasing after people that 

2532
01:59:03,640 --> 01:59:06,430
are committing crimes all day.
Holy shit.

2533
01:59:06,460 --> 01:59:07,930
How stressful would that be,
man?

2534
01:59:08,800 --> 01:59:10,380
She Was a five year veteran.
Yes,

2535
01:59:10,510 --> 01:59:13,510
correct.
They drop.

2536
01:59:15,490 --> 01:59:16,900
Yeah.
It's just,

2537
01:59:17,020 --> 01:59:18,280
it's just weird,
man.

2538
01:59:18,460 --> 01:59:19,293
It's just weird that we need them and 
it's weird that they become what they 

2539
01:59:23,141 --> 01:59:23,974
are,
you know,

2540
01:59:23,980 --> 01:59:27,790
they become this death dealer or 
lifesaver,

2541
01:59:27,850 --> 01:59:28,683
you know,
someone's coming after you and the cops 

2542
01:59:29,531 --> 01:59:30,960
break in there.
The lifesaver.

2543
01:59:30,970 --> 01:59:34,270
They're gonna like what a crazy position
for someone to take,

2544
01:59:34,900 --> 01:59:37,870
you know,
fucking stressful.

2545
01:59:39,130 --> 01:59:41,170
I would never do that.
Fuck that.

2546
01:59:41,470 --> 01:59:43,660
especially nowadays it's even worse.
I mean,

2547
01:59:43,661 --> 01:59:46,270
I probably was cooler back then because 
he got away with so much,

2548
01:59:46,271 --> 01:59:47,530
you know.
Did you see the seven,

2549
01:59:47,531 --> 01:59:48,820
five,
seven,

2550
01:59:48,821 --> 01:59:49,654
five,
the documentary of the 75 whole lee 

2551
01:59:53,050 --> 01:59:54,400
shit.
Okay.

2552
01:59:54,460 --> 01:59:58,990
And uh,
we had uh,

2553
01:59:59,020 --> 02:00:01,210
mike dowd from the,
um,

2554
02:00:01,720 --> 02:00:05,380
from the movie come in and explain to us
like what it was like back then.

2555
02:00:05,610 --> 02:00:07,020
Great guy.
By the way,

2556
02:00:07,030 --> 02:00:10,750
he's been on joey's podcast to um,
how do you spell his name?

2557
02:00:12,360 --> 02:00:14,030
Dow d

2558
02:00:15,130 --> 02:00:16,840
does the way it sounds.
He's awesome.

2559
02:00:17,500 --> 02:00:18,820
Yeah.
I didn't want to fuck it up,

2560
02:00:19,300 --> 02:00:21,670
but I think it's just the real mike 
doubt on twitter.

2561
02:00:21,671 --> 02:00:22,504
What is the on twitter.

2562
02:00:24,450 --> 02:00:26,160
Great guy.
But holy shit.

2563
02:00:26,161 --> 02:00:27,900
Was he a criminal?
Really?

2564
02:00:28,080 --> 02:00:29,970
Oh my god.
They were the cops.

2565
02:00:29,990 --> 02:00:30,823
The 75th precinct he foUnd out from the.
It's an amazing documentary and you 

2566
02:00:35,581 --> 02:00:38,970
found out from the very first week on 
the job,

2567
02:00:38,971 --> 02:00:43,920
lIke in that range that the cops were 
all corrupt and that you never turned on

2568
02:00:43,921 --> 02:00:46,410
one of your own and you know,
you just fucking.

2569
02:00:46,800 --> 02:00:51,300
They had rules that they would skirt 
around and he got deeply,

2570
02:00:51,540 --> 02:00:56,540
deeper and deeper ingrained in this 
world of a crime while you were a police

2571
02:00:57,391 --> 02:00:58,224
officer.
Drug dealing while your police officer 

2572
02:01:00,241 --> 02:01:02,850
intimidation while you're police 
protection,

2573
02:01:02,851 --> 02:01:03,684
while you're a police officer and he's 
driving a corvette and live in like a 

2574
02:01:07,321 --> 02:01:08,154
bar and they're going on trips,
they're driving a boat and then a bunch 

2575
02:01:10,831 --> 02:01:12,810
of crazy shit happens.
And one guy,

2576
02:01:12,811 --> 02:01:15,310
rats the other guy out.
It's madness.

2577
02:01:15,360 --> 02:01:17,520
It's fucking great,
dude.

2578
02:01:17,521 --> 02:01:22,500
It's a great documentary and also he's 
like super honest about the whole thing.

2579
02:01:22,530 --> 02:01:24,900
He's super honest about everything 
because he went to jail,

2580
02:01:25,050 --> 02:01:25,883
did his time and then got out and then 
they made the documentary because it's 

2581
02:01:28,261 --> 02:01:30,570
all about like.
It's like the 19 eighties.

2582
02:01:31,350 --> 02:01:33,330
It's fucking amazing,
dude.

2583
02:01:33,360 --> 02:01:36,090
It's a great documentary.
I missed apollo.

2584
02:01:36,120 --> 02:01:37,060
Told me about it.
Well,

2585
02:01:37,100 --> 02:01:38,580
that's cool.
You still get it.

2586
02:01:38,581 --> 02:01:40,250
I mean it's on.
I think it's on itunes.

2587
02:01:40,251 --> 02:01:43,370
I think it's on everything.
Fucking good.

2588
02:01:43,371 --> 02:01:44,204
Dude.

2589
02:01:44,360 --> 02:01:48,380
Did you look at the video yet with the 
pigeons in the bread factory in Russia?

2590
02:01:48,980 --> 02:01:49,640
No,
no,

2591
02:01:49,640 --> 02:01:51,110
I haven't looked that.
It's disturbing.

2592
02:01:51,470 --> 02:01:56,470
There's this a mil fill with grain and 
these pigeons are eating from the top of

2593
02:01:57,111 --> 02:02:00,640
it and they're so stupid that they just 
get sucked into the.

2594
02:02:00,700 --> 02:02:03,980
The grain jesus and chopped up into the 
bread.

2595
02:02:03,981 --> 02:02:06,410
So like if you've had bread in Russia 
lately,

2596
02:02:06,710 --> 02:02:10,820
a lot of his pitch and the pitch video 
two down.

2597
02:02:11,810 --> 02:02:12,643
Oh my god.
Three down to one of them falls and 

2598
02:02:16,611 --> 02:02:17,444
lands in and just get sucked in.
This isn't saying this is fucking 

2599
02:02:22,191 --> 02:02:24,620
insane.
It's one of the most disturbing.

2600
02:02:24,680 --> 02:02:27,660
Jamie immediately make a video of this

2601
02:02:28,420 --> 02:02:32,200
to my phone so I can instagram this.
The world needs to know more.

2602
02:02:33,450 --> 02:02:34,660
Yeah,
it's fucked.

2603
02:02:34,700 --> 02:02:38,310
That's harsh.
It's very gross and scary and sad.

2604
02:02:39,420 --> 02:02:42,930
It's just a harsh life.
a dumber pigeons to.

2605
02:02:43,410 --> 02:02:43,831
Well,
look,

2606
02:02:43,831 --> 02:02:44,664
I live.
Their heads are mad if your head was 

2607
02:02:45,331 --> 02:02:46,164
that little.

2608
02:02:46,760 --> 02:02:47,593
Yeah,
I guess,

2609
02:02:47,960 --> 02:02:52,960
but I mean zIka babies grow up to be 
pretty smart.

2610
02:02:56,300 --> 02:02:57,620
Nope,
we haven't had any.

2611
02:02:58,130 --> 02:03:00,710
That's true.
It hasn't grown up are really.

2612
02:03:00,740 --> 02:03:03,380
I don't think so.
I mean not that I've ever heard of.

2613
02:03:03,410 --> 02:03:04,243
I just made that up.
I think there's actually adult zika 

2614
02:03:05,721 --> 02:03:06,554
babies.
I think so because I was thinking about 

2615
02:03:08,150 --> 02:03:11,390
making zika hats for zika people,
so it makes it look like their heads are

2616
02:03:11,391 --> 02:03:12,224
bigger.
I don't want to start a conspiracy on 

2617
02:03:17,471 --> 02:03:18,304
it,
but I read recently that the zika has 

2618
02:03:19,281 --> 02:03:20,810
been around for a long time.
Yes.

2619
02:03:21,250 --> 02:03:24,470
Like and then I just looked it up.
Now it says since 19 forties.

2620
02:03:24,471 --> 02:03:26,390
That's when it was first discovered.
Yes.

2621
02:03:26,480 --> 02:03:30,290
There's actually a zika adults and they 
look like zika babies by grown up.

2622
02:03:30,520 --> 02:03:30,780
Yeah.

2623
02:03:30,780 --> 02:03:34,240
Google that google zika adults.
Hm.

2624
02:03:35,430 --> 02:03:36,263
There's some pictures of like really,
really old picture of people with weird 

2625
02:03:39,600 --> 02:03:44,130
deformities that you'll think of like 
carnival pictures and shit like that.

2626
02:03:44,190 --> 02:03:46,230
I wonder how many of those were that 
kind of a thing.

2627
02:03:46,300 --> 02:03:47,450
So like or like.
Yeah,

2628
02:03:47,910 --> 02:03:49,610
I know what to say.
Like beetle juice or.

2629
02:03:49,630 --> 02:03:50,463
No,
that's.

2630
02:03:51,380 --> 02:03:52,350
I don't know.
Yeah,

2631
02:03:52,351 --> 02:03:53,300
maybe.
Yeah.

2632
02:03:53,340 --> 02:03:54,410
Who knows?
There's some.

2633
02:03:54,570 --> 02:03:58,590
I mean the little errors in the scripts 
that make a person.

2634
02:03:58,680 --> 02:03:59,820
Now,
what are those errors?

2635
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:01,200
What is this?
Oh my god.

2636
02:04:02,240 --> 02:04:05,890
So you can virus.
Michael microcephaly suffers.

2637
02:04:06,670 --> 02:04:11,670
Cephalopathy casey scarborough,
sef allopathy suffers campaign.

2638
02:04:13,470 --> 02:04:15,350
Wow.
How many people go,

2639
02:04:15,370 --> 02:04:16,620
oh,
that's crazy.

2640
02:04:16,710 --> 02:04:17,543
How many people are zika?
but they just have hats and you never 

2641
02:04:19,510 --> 02:04:21,230
another zika.
See,

2642
02:04:21,320 --> 02:04:22,153
is that a thing?

2643
02:04:22,380 --> 02:04:23,790
Hold on,
go back to the picture.

2644
02:04:24,060 --> 02:04:24,893
That's crazy.
There's a fucking bug that makes your 

2645
02:04:26,761 --> 02:04:27,594
head smaller.
Just just stop and think about how 

2646
02:04:30,061 --> 02:04:33,060
insane that is.
We need to eradicate that bug.

2647
02:04:33,990 --> 02:04:36,120
There's a bug that makes your baby's 
head smaller.

2648
02:04:36,121 --> 02:04:36,954
Okay.
I don't givE fuck what is going on in 

2649
02:04:38,701 --> 02:04:41,490
Russia.
We need to kill all these god damn bugs.

2650
02:04:41,730 --> 02:04:42,563
Stop worrying about stupid shit is 
people that are going to be born with 

2651
02:04:44,521 --> 02:04:45,930
little tiny heads.
Well,

2652
02:04:45,970 --> 02:04:48,720
they're killing the bees in a lot of 
cities.

2653
02:04:48,721 --> 02:04:51,840
They're spraying for zika,
ms dot rosemary are bs.

2654
02:04:51,920 --> 02:04:54,930
Yeah.
It's all fucked up from top to bottom.

2655
02:04:54,990 --> 02:04:57,390
It's fucked up.
Birth defects.

2656
02:04:57,420 --> 02:04:58,680
Ooh,
scary.

2657
02:04:59,010 --> 02:04:59,843
Terrifying.
It's just terrifying to think that 

2658
02:05:03,171 --> 02:05:06,080
there's bugs that can just all this.
I mean,

2659
02:05:06,110 --> 02:05:06,943
even when you hear about things like the
spanish plague that like one flew over 

2660
02:05:10,371 --> 02:05:14,080
the spanish flu,
one flu and like the 18 hundreds was the

2661
02:05:14,081 --> 02:05:16,550
1800 and $1,900
was the spanish flu.

2662
02:05:16,670 --> 02:05:19,080
I want to say the 18 hundreds.
18 nineties,

2663
02:05:19,130 --> 02:05:20,010
you know,
I know this.

2664
02:05:20,090 --> 02:05:23,540
My grasp of history ready beCause uh,
in,

2665
02:05:23,541 --> 02:05:24,850
um,
uh,

2666
02:05:24,860 --> 02:05:25,693
interview with a vampire,
the dude that plays brad pitt had the 

2667
02:05:31,191 --> 02:05:35,960
spanish flu and he was a soldier and he 
was dying in 1918.

2668
02:05:36,110 --> 02:05:36,943
There you go.

2669
02:05:38,660 --> 02:05:39,493
Yeah,

2670
02:05:40,190 --> 02:05:42,620
he was.
I'm so old timey.

2671
02:05:42,680 --> 02:05:43,513
Basically folks,
the other dude who played brad pitt's 

2672
02:05:45,681 --> 02:05:48,920
character of brad pitt's character,
dude black brad pitt played.

2673
02:05:49,250 --> 02:05:50,083
It's hard to say he died with that flu 
and the stat gave him the vampire gene 

2674
02:05:55,520 --> 02:05:56,790
got real issues after that,
bro.

2675
02:05:56,830 --> 02:06:00,530
I didn't really like doing them.
Really like being a vampire,

2676
02:06:02,020 --> 02:06:05,150
really like choking on people's blood,
drink his own daughters.

2677
02:06:05,151 --> 02:06:06,170
Blood was kind of dark.

2678
02:06:06,900 --> 02:06:10,170
We were talking about westworld earlier 
reminded me of something a thought I had

2679
02:06:10,171 --> 02:06:12,900
on here of a couple of people mentioned 
some things about,

2680
02:06:13,050 --> 02:06:13,883
I think dimensions.
Maybe it might've had to do a string 

2681
02:06:16,351 --> 02:06:18,630
theory,
but it had to go with the store.

2682
02:06:18,631 --> 02:06:19,464
I think I showed you this story before.
This came out earlier this year about 

2683
02:06:22,231 --> 02:06:25,020
the scientists have found out that the 
human brain,

2684
02:06:25,050 --> 02:06:27,510
the size of it,
or at least at what a store might be way

2685
02:06:27,511 --> 02:06:32,511
more than they thought previously based 
on the way the brain codes,

2686
02:06:32,760 --> 02:06:33,810
what it's calling bits.

2687
02:06:34,010 --> 02:06:36,440
They need to stop the study right now 
and examined red band,

2688
02:06:37,220 --> 02:06:39,790
but my only point on this is that a.

2689
02:06:40,320 --> 02:06:44,070
There was like 26 up to 26 neuropathways
are discovering the brain,

2690
02:06:44,071 --> 02:06:47,490
which allows for more of maybe thought 
storage and they knew about,

2691
02:06:47,880 --> 02:06:50,080
but when the person came on to mention,
uh,

2692
02:06:50,400 --> 02:06:52,830
dimensions in the past,
a couple of months ago,

2693
02:06:53,220 --> 02:06:57,120
I'd never heard that there was up to 26 
dimensions possibly.

2694
02:06:57,540 --> 02:06:58,950
I'd always heard it was 11.
Yeah.

2695
02:06:58,951 --> 02:06:59,784
And this is the first time I heard 26,
which made me go back to something I 

2696
02:07:01,981 --> 02:07:04,390
had.
I had just heard about what had 26 to do

2697
02:07:04,400 --> 02:07:06,810
with it in the brain and it was this.

2698
02:07:07,180 --> 02:07:07,901
Okay.
So it says,

2699
02:07:07,901 --> 02:07:08,734
according to super string theory,
there are at least 10 dimensions in the 

2700
02:07:11,321 --> 02:07:12,154
universe.
M theory actually suggests there are 11 

2701
02:07:14,981 --> 02:07:15,814
dimensions to space time.
And then both sonic string theory 

2702
02:07:19,361 --> 02:07:22,960
suggests 26 dimensions.
What is both sonic string theory?

2703
02:07:22,970 --> 02:07:25,930
I had never heard that term either,
but that was just kind of ask,

2704
02:07:26,030 --> 02:07:29,360
asking in a strange way like,
do you think that those could be related

2705
02:07:29,361 --> 02:07:30,194
in any way?

2706
02:07:30,230 --> 02:07:31,370
Dude,
when you see that stuff,

2707
02:07:31,371 --> 02:07:34,580
they're writing down on those little 
yellow legal pads and they'll.

2708
02:07:34,581 --> 02:07:37,410
String theorists are going off and 
they're doing computations,

2709
02:07:37,420 --> 02:07:39,190
like you just got to take their word for
it,

2710
02:07:39,740 --> 02:07:40,573
like you can't even try to rationally 
understand how the fuck some dude is 

2711
02:07:44,680 --> 02:07:45,513
looking at a note notebook and figuring 
out how many dimensions there are 

2712
02:07:48,611 --> 02:07:51,520
potentially in the universe,
what the masonic is.

2713
02:07:51,521 --> 02:07:55,030
The original version is string theory 
and now they're on superstring theory or

2714
02:07:55,031 --> 02:07:57,430
supersymmetric string theory.
You know,

2715
02:07:57,431 --> 02:07:59,260
there's a push back about this stuff.

2716
02:07:59,420 --> 02:08:00,253
People and I don't know if the people 
that push back or smart enough to 

2717
02:08:03,171 --> 02:08:06,500
actually be hanging in there with these 
dudes and their ideas.

2718
02:08:07,070 --> 02:08:08,390
I don't know who's right.
It's too,

2719
02:08:08,391 --> 02:08:09,350
it's way,
way,

2720
02:08:09,351 --> 02:08:11,750
way over my head.
I see them talking about this stuff.

2721
02:08:11,751 --> 02:08:13,670
I don't,
I don't have a fucking clue.

2722
02:08:13,980 --> 02:08:17,060
The all the stuff that fascinates me.
I mean that fascinates me for sure.

2723
02:08:17,061 --> 02:08:18,440
But it's.
So,

2724
02:08:18,441 --> 02:08:19,970
uh,
what's the word?

2725
02:08:19,971 --> 02:08:21,500
A theorial.
It's so.

2726
02:08:21,890 --> 02:08:24,380
It's so misty.
It doesn't seem like you can grab it,

2727
02:08:25,190 --> 02:08:26,023
but the quantum physics,
like the guys who are actually studying 

2728
02:08:29,811 --> 02:08:33,200
things like the guys who were looking at
subatomic things,

2729
02:08:33,440 --> 02:08:36,270
that fascinates me like where they can 
actually like the,

2730
02:08:36,280 --> 02:08:40,040
um,
like things being in a state of movement

2731
02:08:40,160 --> 02:08:41,900
and then being still,
you know,

2732
02:08:41,901 --> 02:08:42,734
they've,
they've discovered that and subatomic 

2733
02:08:44,061 --> 02:08:46,000
particles,
it's called a superstate.

2734
02:08:46,840 --> 02:08:48,830
There's moving and still at the same 
time,

2735
02:08:48,860 --> 02:08:50,780
like what,
what does that mean?

2736
02:08:51,430 --> 02:08:52,820
They don't know,
but they were observing it.

2737
02:08:52,850 --> 02:08:55,520
They're observing particles blink in and
out of existence.

2738
02:08:56,120 --> 02:08:56,953
And so I'm sure that it has some 
mathematical computations that go along 

2739
02:08:59,031 --> 02:08:59,864
with that.
But the bottom line is they're aCtually 

2740
02:09:00,441 --> 02:09:03,290
observing this stuff.
This isn't something that,

2741
02:09:03,560 --> 02:09:04,393
you know,
they're writing down on notebooks and 

2742
02:09:05,331 --> 02:09:07,490
you can't get it and you know,
I don't,

2743
02:09:07,570 --> 02:09:08,403
I don't know that language.
So I don't know what the fuck they're 

2744
02:09:09,351 --> 02:09:10,730
getting at.
These are,

2745
02:09:10,731 --> 02:09:11,564
these are people observing subatomic 
particles blinking in and out of 

2746
02:09:15,891 --> 02:09:17,510
existence.
They don't know where they're going.

2747
02:09:18,050 --> 02:09:20,690
This is real.
This is where scientists are going,

2748
02:09:20,691 --> 02:09:25,691
holy shit.
At the smallest visible matter in earth,

2749
02:09:29,150 --> 02:09:30,290
in the world.
And the universe,

2750
02:09:30,291 --> 02:09:33,530
the smallest of the smallest measurable 
matter,

2751
02:09:33,531 --> 02:09:36,890
subatomic particles.
It's magic.

2752
02:09:37,940 --> 02:09:38,773
So when you get to the very bottom to 
get to the smallest thing that we can 

2753
02:09:42,231 --> 02:09:43,064
currently observe,
you're looking at things that perform 

2754
02:09:46,281 --> 02:09:49,310
magic.
They go in and out of existence,

2755
02:09:49,820 --> 02:09:52,130
they're there and they're gone.
They're still in.

2756
02:09:52,131 --> 02:09:52,964
They're moving there like a god.
They're like a crazy magician that like 

2757
02:09:59,241 --> 02:10:04,241
a psychedelic trip at the smallest 
measurable amount of reality.

2758
02:10:06,320 --> 02:10:10,550
The universe behaves like a magic trick.
That's fucking amazing.

2759
02:10:11,990 --> 02:10:15,170
It's mostly nothing like an atom is 
mostly nothing.

2760
02:10:16,550 --> 02:10:17,383
It's probably still there.
It probably does a trick to the eye of 

2761
02:10:19,191 --> 02:10:21,590
not being able to see it.
Your navy could be,

2762
02:10:21,591 --> 02:10:22,880
but I don't think if they're using an 
item,

2763
02:10:22,881 --> 02:10:23,714
measure it.
They using some pretty sophisticated 

2764
02:10:25,131 --> 02:10:27,080
equipment right there,
pretty sure.

2765
02:10:27,081 --> 02:10:27,200
Or

2766
02:10:27,200 --> 02:10:32,200
this thing somehow or another disappears
and reappears and they don't know how.

2767
02:10:32,530 --> 02:10:33,351
And you might.
Right?

2768
02:10:33,351 --> 02:10:34,184
They might be able to come up with 
better and better equipment than 10 

2769
02:10:36,321 --> 02:10:37,071
years from now.
They go,

2770
02:10:37,071 --> 02:10:39,100
oh,
that's not what we were saying.

2771
02:10:39,310 --> 02:10:41,030
We were seeing this.
It's totally possible,

2772
02:10:41,060 --> 02:10:44,240
but they're all saying it right now.
And if they're right,

2773
02:10:44,530 --> 02:10:46,690
if mean this is not only a debated 
thing,

2774
02:10:46,720 --> 02:10:50,540
like the fact that subatomic particles 
blink in and out of existence,

2775
02:10:50,541 --> 02:10:52,820
I think all those super smart dudes 
except that shit.

2776
02:10:54,050 --> 02:10:55,100
That's magic,
dude.

2777
02:10:55,310 --> 02:10:58,010
they're going away and coming back like,
where the fuck are they going?

2778
02:10:58,011 --> 02:11:00,600
what's happening in there?
How's that thing moving?

2779
02:11:00,601 --> 02:11:01,371
Instill?
Well,

2780
02:11:01,371 --> 02:11:04,610
it just is what you mean.
What are you looking at?

2781
02:11:07,540 --> 02:11:10,990
Discovery by the large hadron collider,
jesus christ,

2782
02:11:11,020 --> 02:11:13,300
or not enough official discovery.
What's the new theory?

2783
02:11:13,690 --> 02:11:14,523
Large hadron collider set to discover,
discover fifth dimension and doorway to 

2784
02:11:18,371 --> 02:11:20,710
other universes.
Jesus christ.

2785
02:11:21,460 --> 02:11:24,670
This is not good.
This is a movie.

2786
02:11:26,300 --> 02:11:29,360
They're going to open that fucking 
doorway and those grades are going to Be

2787
02:11:29,361 --> 02:11:30,440
waiting on the other side.

2788
02:11:31,340 --> 02:11:33,210
You can take your exit.
Do you have any eggs?

2789
02:11:33,970 --> 02:11:34,803
If you have eggs,
they're going to take you middle of the 

2790
02:11:38,441 --> 02:11:40,780
night.
Speaking of eggs,

2791
02:11:40,781 --> 02:11:41,614
did you hear that?
That there's one of those places that 

2792
02:11:44,810 --> 02:11:48,610
gets like sperm and eggs and I made a 
person with three people's dna.

2793
02:11:48,820 --> 02:11:51,100
No one wants to hear about that.
What's that?

2794
02:11:51,780 --> 02:11:55,480
They combined the dna of three people 
and uh,

2795
02:11:55,590 --> 02:11:58,740
through in vitro fertilization made a 
baby.

2796
02:11:59,340 --> 02:12:00,173
so the baby was born.
So there's a baby born with the dna of 

2797
02:12:02,911 --> 02:12:04,770
three people.
Not two people,

2798
02:12:04,770 --> 02:12:06,210
but three people.
How did they mix it?

2799
02:12:06,211 --> 02:12:09,050
Like gargling,
they just don't know.

2800
02:12:09,450 --> 02:12:10,283
They just did.
We just put it on this in the bitches 

2801
02:12:12,901 --> 02:12:14,850
mouth and tell her to gargle and spit in
a cup.

2802
02:12:15,360 --> 02:12:18,420
Don't use that word pitch and this show 
just so rude.

2803
02:12:18,450 --> 02:12:19,490
Rich.
Hey,

2804
02:12:19,750 --> 02:12:24,360
where did that take place?
That baby was born in like Russia is her

2805
02:12:24,430 --> 02:12:26,400
name came up on the.
I just googled it.

2806
02:12:26,401 --> 02:12:29,610
There's an actual faq on web md about 
it.

2807
02:12:29,611 --> 02:12:30,480
So it's.
Oh really?

2808
02:12:30,481 --> 02:12:32,560
What are they saying?
Babies definitely gay or no,

2809
02:12:33,520 --> 02:12:36,300
I've found another article.
It's going to be a gay gladiator.

2810
02:12:36,590 --> 02:12:39,630
It's going to be the most handsome about
the technique is safe on.

2811
02:12:39,690 --> 02:12:41,340
Whoa.
Three person babies.

2812
02:12:41,400 --> 02:12:43,320
Ivf technique safe.
Okay.

2813
02:12:43,321 --> 02:12:44,190
If you say so,
dude,

2814
02:12:44,240 --> 02:12:46,050
that's awesome.
I got to take your word for it.

2815
02:12:46,350 --> 02:12:47,970
I don't know wHat that means.
That it's safe.

2816
02:12:48,030 --> 02:12:49,950
We don't know how many people have been 
born.

2817
02:12:50,200 --> 02:12:51,033
Do we have a real good study group?
Said 500 eggs from 64 donor women found 

2818
02:12:55,441 --> 02:12:58,460
that the new procedure did not adversely
affect embryo development.

2819
02:12:58,970 --> 02:13:01,160
That's what you say.
Now when that baby grows up to read your

2820
02:13:01,161 --> 02:13:03,140
fucking mind,
he got a problem.

2821
02:13:03,830 --> 02:13:07,130
Imagine if They put chips in these kids 
when they were little like killed.

2822
02:13:07,131 --> 02:13:09,550
Chips were just like,
we don't know how this is gonna work out

2823
02:13:09,570 --> 02:13:11,780
just in cases.
dude goes on a murderous rampage.

2824
02:13:12,020 --> 02:13:12,853
We want to be able to have a button that
we can press that just shuts them off 

2825
02:13:15,681 --> 02:13:17,090
because if you have a designer baby,
me,

2826
02:13:17,091 --> 02:13:19,520
your baby could be like a super athlete,
super genius,

2827
02:13:19,820 --> 02:13:23,900
but we don't know longterm consequences.
So if you agree to this,

2828
02:13:23,930 --> 02:13:27,440
we'll put the chip and your baby and 
we'll give you a kill switch.

2829
02:13:27,710 --> 02:13:30,110
So if your baby goes on a rampage of it 
all goes wrong.

2830
02:13:30,200 --> 02:13:32,570
We'll give a kill switch.
But the parents of the babies,

2831
02:13:32,571 --> 02:13:33,404
a super baby was going to be pissed.
How come these fucking regular babies 

2832
02:13:35,401 --> 02:13:36,240
don't have a kill switch?

2833
02:13:36,240 --> 02:13:37,073
You think about all the goddamn 
murderers that have ever existed all 

2834
02:13:39,241 --> 02:13:41,400
throughout time.
none of them were super babies,

2835
02:13:41,460 --> 02:13:45,210
so you're blaming my kids.
You're blaming my super kids for all the

2836
02:13:45,211 --> 02:13:46,044
shit you regular kids.
Do you want my kid to have a fucking 

2837
02:13:48,181 --> 02:13:49,050
chip?
You can kill them.

2838
02:13:49,110 --> 02:13:50,790
Everybody's got to have a chip.
We can kill them.

2839
02:13:51,030 --> 02:13:51,863
So we all signed an agreement because we
want to keep the people safe from the 

2840
02:13:53,731 --> 02:13:54,564
super baby,
so everybody signs an agreement that 

2841
02:13:55,651 --> 02:13:58,590
everybody has a chip in the back of 
their head and we all were chips,

2842
02:13:58,920 --> 02:13:59,753
regular baby,
super babies and everybody just say so 

2843
02:14:01,861 --> 02:14:02,694
polite because you're terrified.
Terrified that the government is going 

2844
02:14:05,771 --> 02:14:07,380
to come along and kill.
Switch,

2845
02:14:07,440 --> 02:14:09,080
chip.
That's the.

2846
02:14:09,120 --> 02:14:12,090
That's the key to a healthy,
happy society.

2847
02:14:12,330 --> 02:14:15,060
Everyone's terrified of getting your 
kill switch hit.

2848
02:14:15,960 --> 02:14:16,793
ThAt's the future.
That's why we have to look forward to 

2849
02:14:17,941 --> 02:14:18,570
it.

2850
02:14:18,570 --> 02:14:19,403
Close to the house.
Remember that movie gattica with ethan 

2851
02:14:22,171 --> 02:14:24,630
hawke and they have a kIll switch.
It wasn't kill switch,

2852
02:14:24,631 --> 02:14:27,090
but when you're born you're either valid
or invalid,

2853
02:14:27,091 --> 02:14:27,924
I think is what it was and like the tie 
the society and invalid do all the rest 

2854
02:14:33,061 --> 02:14:34,260
of the shit work.
Whoa.

2855
02:14:34,290 --> 02:14:37,090
He likes chicks himself to become a 
valid in some way.

2856
02:14:37,091 --> 02:14:38,490
That's how the.
That's what the movie's all about.

2857
02:14:38,550 --> 02:14:40,460
He tricks his code.
Yeah.

2858
02:14:40,470 --> 02:14:42,520
Yeah.
He gets a fake fingerprint hair,

2859
02:14:42,610 --> 02:14:44,850
fake eyes and all this shit and all 
those sensors.

2860
02:14:45,100 --> 02:14:47,520
This is the early nineties,
late nineties.

2861
02:14:47,521 --> 02:14:48,354
I feel like for

2862
02:14:48,440 --> 02:14:49,273
if somebody creates a synthetic person 
who told me this synthetic person's not 

2863
02:14:52,011 --> 02:14:55,520
going to have a kill switch.
Like if you don'T know,

2864
02:14:55,550 --> 02:14:57,380
if you don't know what that guy's 
capable of.

2865
02:14:57,410 --> 02:14:59,600
Like if someone says,
well there is one option.

2866
02:14:59,750 --> 02:15:02,750
Like what if they tried to pass it 
through congress congress like fuck you.

2867
02:15:03,290 --> 02:15:04,310
And then someone says,
okay,

2868
02:15:04,311 --> 02:15:09,311
there's this solution would if every 
synthetic kid is born with a kill switch

2869
02:15:10,460 --> 02:15:11,180
and then they go,
okay,

2870
02:15:11,180 --> 02:15:12,620
well it's reasonable,
it's reasonable.

2871
02:15:13,360 --> 02:15:14,193
And then everybody by 2070 we're all 
born with a kill switch is no more 

2872
02:15:17,781 --> 02:15:18,614
crime.
Every now and then someone freaks out 

2873
02:15:19,701 --> 02:15:21,920
and they just zap,
drop them,

2874
02:15:22,190 --> 02:15:23,840
chop them up,
feed it to the garden.

2875
02:15:25,610 --> 02:15:26,443
I'm remembering that other movie,
that justin timberlake movie where he's 

2876
02:15:28,251 --> 02:15:32,330
got a time to end time now everyone is 
25 and then they all die.

2877
02:15:32,450 --> 02:15:33,283
You watch too many movies.
The so future movie that you made a 

2878
02:15:36,771 --> 02:15:39,380
movie.
the concept is really good.

2879
02:15:39,381 --> 02:15:41,660
Movies.
Timberlake did a bunch of movies.

2880
02:15:41,661 --> 02:15:45,140
He was actually actually a good actor.
Alpha dog or something else.

2881
02:15:45,390 --> 02:15:47,450
It was in something else too.
It's good actor.

2882
02:15:49,970 --> 02:15:50,810
Okay,
kimberly,

2883
02:15:50,890 --> 02:15:52,590
it will be in time.
It was a really cool concept.

2884
02:15:52,591 --> 02:15:55,260
Once you get 20 fIve,
you stop aging and then your,

2885
02:15:55,290 --> 02:15:57,090
your uh,
your whatever,

2886
02:15:57,120 --> 02:16:01,770
a year of life starts going.
But that's all the currency to you.

2887
02:16:01,771 --> 02:16:03,720
Work for time.
You can trade time,

2888
02:16:03,750 --> 02:16:06,600
you spend time and then once your time 
is up,

2889
02:16:06,720 --> 02:16:07,553
you're done.
But people have thousands of centuries 

2890
02:16:09,900 --> 02:16:11,130
of years built up on their little clock.

2891
02:16:11,460 --> 02:16:14,010
Right?
So like a sultan of Brunei or some super

2892
02:16:14,011 --> 02:16:16,320
rich centuries and centurIes live 
forever.

2893
02:16:17,140 --> 02:16:17,973
Huh?

2894
02:16:20,620 --> 02:16:21,453
Listen man,
all this we're talking about when it 

2895
02:16:23,591 --> 02:16:26,250
comes to the future about what could 
happen like these,

2896
02:16:26,290 --> 02:16:30,670
these silly science fiction movies,
they probably in comparison to how crazy

2897
02:16:30,671 --> 02:16:31,540
it's actually going to be

2898
02:16:34,190 --> 02:16:37,490
playing vr know you've got to play the 
dunkin's vr.

2899
02:16:37,760 --> 02:16:40,670
How awesome was that on the gary?
Was it scary?

2900
02:16:40,671 --> 02:16:41,900
Awesome,
scary,

2901
02:16:42,120 --> 02:16:44,040
awesome and awesome in a way where you 
go,

2902
02:16:44,160 --> 02:16:44,840
well,
it's not.

2903
02:16:44,840 --> 02:16:46,890
Not like right now.
I knew I had goggles on.

2904
02:16:47,250 --> 02:16:48,083
I knew I was playing a video game where 
you're on a castle and these little 

2905
02:16:51,121 --> 02:16:53,400
cartoons are bouncing.
You shoot bows and arrows.

2906
02:16:53,401 --> 02:16:54,450
I don't know if you've played that one 
yet.

2907
02:16:54,630 --> 02:16:54,930
Yeah,
no.

2908
02:16:54,930 --> 02:16:55,920
Yeah.
I haven't played it,

2909
02:16:55,921 --> 02:16:57,330
but I know what we're talking about.
It's really fun.

2910
02:16:57,420 --> 02:16:57,730
Yeah,

2911
02:16:57,730 --> 02:16:59,380
so part of it was like,
whoa,

2912
02:16:59,381 --> 02:17:02,110
this is so cool,
but there's another party that goes,

2913
02:17:02,111 --> 02:17:03,430
you know where this is going.
Right.

2914
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:07,870
Where this has gone in.
This is not that far of a time.

2915
02:17:08,290 --> 02:17:10,960
You got to think when we were watChing 
that phonograph ones.

2916
02:17:10,961 --> 02:17:12,100
That photograph from jamie.

2917
02:17:13,700 --> 02:17:14,590
Yeah.
Okay.

2918
02:17:15,130 --> 02:17:17,050
So let's,
let's give it 1880,

2919
02:17:17,110 --> 02:17:18,100
let's say 18.
18.

2920
02:17:18,130 --> 02:17:20,560
Think about 18,
80 to 2016.

2921
02:17:20,740 --> 02:17:21,573
That's not very fucking long.
So we've gone from a phonograph to a 

2922
02:17:25,451 --> 02:17:28,420
fake world in what,

2923
02:17:28,720 --> 02:17:30,190
a couple hundred years?
Yeah,

2924
02:17:30,191 --> 02:17:32,710
what a thousand years.
Exactly.

2925
02:17:32,770 --> 02:17:37,770
We're in it right now.
That's why this election is happening.

2926
02:17:38,070 --> 02:17:39,970
Yeah.
That's why this thing is so ridiculous.

2927
02:17:40,050 --> 02:17:40,883
Yeah,
it could be that it's happening right 

2928
02:17:41,771 --> 02:17:42,604
now.
The playstation just release their 

2929
02:17:44,950 --> 02:17:47,920
virtual reality today or last night.
And uh,

2930
02:17:47,980 --> 02:17:50,230
so now that's going to be.
It's for the first time.

2931
02:17:50,500 --> 02:17:53,590
It's a price point that's going to hit 
the masses.

2932
02:17:54,100 --> 02:17:56,140
Uh,
so you're going to see a lot more people

2933
02:17:56,141 --> 02:17:57,640
are going to have it.
Uh,

2934
02:17:57,641 --> 02:18:02,290
so this was a huge day yesterday and 
there's one of the games that come,

2935
02:18:02,320 --> 02:18:03,153
comes with that I believe is where 
you're underwater and it's not really a 

2936
02:18:05,831 --> 02:18:07,810
game.
You're just hanging out in a shark,

2937
02:18:08,170 --> 02:18:10,960
comes close to you and you get attacked 
by a shark.

2938
02:18:10,990 --> 02:18:13,150
But I guess it's so scary that you're 
like,

2939
02:18:13,200 --> 02:18:18,200
oh good.
And that's just the atari 2,600

2940
02:18:18,761 --> 02:18:19,780
of vr.
You know,

2941
02:18:19,781 --> 02:18:23,140
what is going to happen?
And it's going to be insane if it hasn't

2942
02:18:23,141 --> 02:18:24,100
already.
I mean,

2943
02:18:24,101 --> 02:18:25,930
we both remember pong.
Oh yeah.

2944
02:18:26,120 --> 02:18:27,670
Amazing.
Right?

2945
02:18:27,671 --> 02:18:29,650
But when it first came out,
you were amazed.

2946
02:18:29,770 --> 02:18:31,990
You can actually interact with something
that's on the tv.

2947
02:18:31,991 --> 02:18:33,130
Yeah,
it was insane.

2948
02:18:33,960 --> 02:18:36,990
That was so good.
Was so crazy and wasn't that bIg.

2949
02:18:37,320 --> 02:18:38,153
He like,
look how little it is when we plan and 

2950
02:18:39,411 --> 02:18:40,720
you stick a cartridge in there.
Dude.

2951
02:18:41,490 --> 02:18:42,510
Dude,
dude,

2952
02:18:43,280 --> 02:18:48,280
it was awesome.
And compare that to this new doom,

2953
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:51,000
you know?
I mean,

2954
02:18:51,060 --> 02:18:51,893
what,
what we're seeing now in just a short 

2955
02:18:53,251 --> 02:18:56,480
amount of time is insane.
I mean we've got a,

2956
02:18:56,481 --> 02:18:57,314
a giant jump of progress in 200 years.
So what the fuck is it going to be in 

2957
02:19:04,291 --> 02:19:05,430
less than 200 years?
Right.

2958
02:19:05,431 --> 02:19:06,600
And you say 18.
Eighties.

2959
02:19:07,490 --> 02:19:08,600
I mean that's.
What

2960
02:19:08,660 --> 02:19:09,493
did you see what bmw is announced?
I don't know if they just did it 

2961
02:19:11,031 --> 02:19:12,330
yesterday or this week,
but it's,

2962
02:19:12,370 --> 02:19:14,090
it's long this vr stuff.
Oh,

2963
02:19:14,091 --> 02:19:16,400
I did see this motorcycle.
Yeah.

2964
02:19:16,450 --> 02:19:17,760
Dude,
that's insane.

2965
02:19:17,770 --> 02:19:19,790
Says you won't get into a wreck and you 
won't need a helmet.

2966
02:19:20,330 --> 02:19:21,830
it balances itself.
Dude,

2967
02:19:21,890 --> 02:19:23,060
I don't know about.
Won't get in a wreck,

2968
02:19:23,061 --> 02:19:25,130
but he basically can't,
is what they're trying to say.

2969
02:19:25,700 --> 02:19:28,220
How could it not rec?
Explain that.

2970
02:19:28,340 --> 02:19:30,500
it doesn't make any sense.
Nothing can record.

2971
02:19:30,620 --> 02:19:32,480
Something can still reckoned to you 
probably.

2972
02:19:32,630 --> 02:19:34,610
But uh,
but you can't fall over it.

2973
02:19:34,670 --> 02:19:38,060
That's what I'm saying.
You could fall off it.

2974
02:19:38,061 --> 02:19:39,350
Yeah.
Maybe.

2975
02:19:39,450 --> 02:19:40,283
Sounds fun.
You're going to fall off it because the 

2976
02:19:42,501 --> 02:19:45,690
force that it's going to need to require
to correct you.

2977
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,080
You can look at that.
Oh my god.

2978
02:19:48,500 --> 02:19:49,333
That's what it looks like.
It's trying to find the helmet because 

2979
02:19:51,980 --> 02:19:54,140
you don't have to go to the thing.

2980
02:19:54,320 --> 02:19:57,020
Here's the head.
Show us a video bitch.

2981
02:19:57,590 --> 02:19:58,700
These are all from.
These aren't real.

2982
02:20:00,320 --> 02:20:01,153
Oh my god.
What were you going to stay there and 

2983
02:20:02,300 --> 02:20:03,950
opened that up?
Oh my god,

2984
02:20:03,951 --> 02:20:05,230
that's real.
That's tron.

2985
02:20:05,380 --> 02:20:06,770
It's,
I don't know that it's out yet,

2986
02:20:06,771 --> 02:20:10,490
but I already have.
But they have visors.

2987
02:20:10,491 --> 02:20:11,324
The visor gives information including 
speed and cornering hints to help ride 

2988
02:20:14,711 --> 02:20:16,760
or it's got a rear view like it's a,
it's a screen.

2989
02:20:16,761 --> 02:20:17,594
It's ar,
which is what a lot of companies are 

2990
02:20:18,951 --> 02:20:20,240
making a bet on.
Vr,

2991
02:20:20,270 --> 02:20:21,500
ar,
augmented reality.

2992
02:20:22,220 --> 02:20:24,700
So this is an ar visor that's gonna sit 
there.

2993
02:20:24,750 --> 02:20:26,390
Your rear view mirror is going to be in 
that.

2994
02:20:26,391 --> 02:20:29,900
Your speed is going to be in that 
updated info on cars.

2995
02:20:29,960 --> 02:20:31,130
Probably ahead of you are going to be 
in,

2996
02:20:31,131 --> 02:20:33,860
especially if it's dark dude,
that's the batman thing.

2997
02:20:33,861 --> 02:20:35,200
Right in the upper right hand corner.

2998
02:20:35,360 --> 02:20:38,000
The dark knight batman thing.
How close is that?

2999
02:20:38,001 --> 02:20:40,730
Pretty close.
I would sue like bitch,

3000
02:20:40,731 --> 02:20:43,310
that's my try.
God damn that link.

3001
02:20:43,370 --> 02:20:44,820
It's so.
It's basically they look,

3002
02:20:44,870 --> 02:20:49,130
it looks like the wheels are a little 
bit wider than a typical motorcycle.

3003
02:20:49,131 --> 02:20:51,650
Is There a different profile view where 
you could see how,

3004
02:20:51,651 --> 02:20:55,490
why the tires are okay now?
Not much wider.

3005
02:20:55,880 --> 02:20:57,020
like a little bit though,
right?

3006
02:20:57,350 --> 02:20:59,030
A little bit wider than a regular 
motorcycle.

3007
02:20:59,090 --> 02:20:59,923
Yeah.
They have a car that goes along with 

3008
02:21:00,831 --> 02:21:02,600
this I think is what I was hearing,
but the car,

3009
02:21:02,630 --> 02:21:05,960
the car they showed seems like it's 
completely computer generated.

3010
02:21:05,961 --> 02:21:08,140
We're living in The future.
Is this real nice?

3011
02:21:08,141 --> 02:21:10,230
they're eating healthy so I can have 
this in sunday.

3012
02:21:10,550 --> 02:21:11,810
Dude,
look at this.

3013
02:21:12,110 --> 02:21:12,943
This is insane.
This girl is on this thing and she's 

3014
02:21:16,161 --> 02:21:20,450
flying around in this space age 
motorcycle.

3015
02:21:20,480 --> 02:21:23,670
Oh my god.
And looking at the.

3016
02:21:23,720 --> 02:21:28,340
The view through these goggles that are 
showing where everything is.

3017
02:21:28,910 --> 02:21:30,860
Oh my god,
this is amazing,

3018
02:21:32,520 --> 02:21:33,353
dude.
We live in awesome times and that's the 

3019
02:21:35,121 --> 02:21:35,954
navigation system.
Is that what she's looking at it or 

3020
02:21:37,011 --> 02:21:38,570
goggles?
That's what it's going.

3021
02:21:38,780 --> 02:21:41,660
Oh man,
this is amazing.

3022
02:21:42,410 --> 02:21:45,440
It illuminates the road in front of you.
Is that what was supposed to show?

3023
02:21:45,441 --> 02:21:49,880
What was that acid kicked in?
Was this called jamie?

3024
02:21:50,240 --> 02:21:52,910
I don't notice the video next.
The next.

3025
02:21:53,150 --> 02:21:55,670
I don't know.
It's just be observant of motorcycling.

3026
02:21:55,671 --> 02:21:58,820
The bmw motor.
Rad.

3027
02:21:58,880 --> 02:21:59,750
What does it say?
Modal.

3028
02:21:59,840 --> 02:22:03,350
I'm not on youtube for this video.
This is from the daily mail website.

3029
02:22:03,380 --> 02:22:05,870
Motor rad vision.
Next 100.

3030
02:22:06,040 --> 02:22:08,150
It's sexy.
It's pretty dope.

3031
02:22:08,800 --> 02:22:09,633
But

3032
02:22:10,390 --> 02:22:11,223
you know,

3033
02:22:11,620 --> 02:22:14,180
it's still like someone Could still run 
a red light.

3034
02:22:15,170 --> 02:22:18,200
You can't say that.
You're not going to get t boned.

3035
02:22:19,190 --> 02:22:21,830
The car looks like they get a car that 
does the same thing,

3036
02:22:21,831 --> 02:22:22,664
but check this shit out because the way 
that you're going to say this is super 

3037
02:22:25,261 --> 02:22:30,120
fake stuff.
StrAnge looking.

3038
02:22:30,300 --> 02:22:32,250
Oh my god,
thIs is crazy.

3039
02:22:32,940 --> 02:22:35,640
You sit inside of it,
you press a button

3040
02:22:37,580 --> 02:22:40,340
and a steering wheel pops out of the 
dashboard.

3041
02:22:41,720 --> 02:22:42,940
What is this?
Real,

3042
02:22:43,790 --> 02:22:45,890
real tired.
Pretty cgi,

3043
02:22:45,891 --> 02:22:46,724
but it's like a cdi.
This is what they're saying they are 

3044
02:22:48,351 --> 02:22:50,570
making and whether or not they're going 
to actually get there.

3045
02:22:50,660 --> 02:22:52,280
Oh my god.
This is dope.

3046
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:58,000
So it shows you where does debris is on 
the road ahead and like highlights.

3047
02:22:59,310 --> 02:23:02,060
It says there's a bike right there.
See it?

3048
02:23:02,070 --> 02:23:03,110
Biker.
How's it?

3049
02:23:03,111 --> 02:23:04,940
See that though?
It saw it before.

3050
02:23:05,060 --> 02:23:06,010
I don't know.
It's using.

3051
02:23:06,020 --> 02:23:07,820
Wow.
Different kinds of technology.

3052
02:23:07,821 --> 02:23:10,060
Like probably like radar and pulses and 
excuse him.

3053
02:23:10,070 --> 02:23:12,680
Big brother bro.
We going to know where you live bro.

3054
02:23:13,670 --> 02:23:16,280
What about the handle?
I want an actual steering wheel.

3055
02:23:16,281 --> 02:23:18,400
Bitch.
Don't give me this stupid joystick.

3056
02:23:18,620 --> 02:23:20,510
Need to drive it because it's going to 
be self driving.

3057
02:23:20,511 --> 02:23:24,350
So it's a really self driving 100 
percent here.

3058
02:23:25,670 --> 02:23:26,780
God,
you trust that.

3059
02:23:26,840 --> 02:23:27,673
I do not trust that now and I haven't 
done the test with him and some people 

3060
02:23:31,731 --> 02:23:34,470
don't even change their oil.
No.

3061
02:23:34,550 --> 02:23:37,340
You think you think they're going to 
have this thing maintained properly,

3062
02:23:38,120 --> 02:23:38,601
right?
I mean,

3063
02:23:38,601 --> 02:23:39,434
how many people are out there?
You get stuck in a lot of traffic and 

3064
02:23:42,441 --> 02:23:45,140
someone in front of you,
it's just below in pollution,

3065
02:23:45,141 --> 02:23:45,974
out of the back of their pipe and you 
cough and just have a fucked up exhaust 

3066
02:23:48,621 --> 02:23:49,454
system or something.
Did you see the self driving car that 

3067
02:23:52,610 --> 02:23:55,850
ran over its own?
Like one of its own engineers?

3068
02:23:55,910 --> 02:23:56,743
Like he was trying to Make it,
trying to show like how the car detects 

3069
02:23:59,661 --> 02:24:01,010
people walking.
Oh no,

3070
02:24:01,440 --> 02:24:02,273
it will slam on the brakes.
And so I think it's volkswagen or 

3071
02:24:04,131 --> 02:24:04,964
something and the guy just said goes,
now watch the car will stop and it just 

3072
02:24:07,551 --> 02:24:08,540
runs them over.

3073
02:24:09,590 --> 02:24:10,490
No,
really?

3074
02:24:10,491 --> 02:24:11,241
Yeah.
Oh,

3075
02:24:11,241 --> 02:24:12,350
poor bastard.
Yeah,

3076
02:24:12,351 --> 02:24:15,100
he,
I don't think he got hurt too bad like,

3077
02:24:15,380 --> 02:24:16,820
but uh,
it didn't stop.

3078
02:24:17,990 --> 02:24:20,750
Will,
they'll probably get it down eventually.

3079
02:24:20,780 --> 02:24:23,450
But you want to be like super sure.
Here it is.

3080
02:24:23,590 --> 02:24:24,423
Oh no,
please don't tell me that this is going 

3081
02:24:26,001 --> 02:24:27,440
to happen.
Oh no.

3082
02:24:27,500 --> 02:24:30,290
Oh no.
Oh my god.

3083
02:24:30,470 --> 02:24:33,970
Oh my god.
And they did that for a demonstration.

3084
02:24:34,020 --> 02:24:37,230
The guy had a suit on his hands in his 
pocket and that was the winner.

3085
02:24:37,270 --> 02:24:38,103
The engineer.
Yeah.

3086
02:24:38,240 --> 02:24:40,300
How about just put a cardboard cutout,
right?

3087
02:24:41,020 --> 02:24:43,430
Okay.
WhaT are we playing games here folks?

3088
02:24:43,500 --> 02:24:44,780
They're real doll.
Yeah,

3089
02:24:44,870 --> 02:24:46,520
exactly.
You don't need to do that,

3090
02:24:46,580 --> 02:24:48,590
but the crash test dummies.
This guys just disappeared.

3091
02:24:48,620 --> 02:24:49,720
Exactly.
Why don't they have crashed?

3092
02:24:49,721 --> 02:24:50,690
Has done,
but to stand.

3093
02:24:50,691 --> 02:24:52,850
They're fucking idiots.
Still stand there yourself.

3094
02:24:52,851 --> 02:24:54,800
Don't you have a life?
Get hit by a car,

3095
02:24:54,801 --> 02:24:56,450
bro.
That guy is probably broken.

3096
02:24:56,540 --> 02:24:58,010
Probably every part of his body is 
broken.

3097
02:24:58,160 --> 02:24:59,360
Yeah.
I mean,

3098
02:25:00,290 --> 02:25:03,530
if you don't think you're going to get 
bumped by that car like that,

3099
02:25:03,680 --> 02:25:06,860
you could easily have broken hip,
broken legs.

3100
02:25:07,850 --> 02:25:11,720
Fuck that dude.
I'm very passionate about this.

3101
02:25:14,990 --> 02:25:18,460
we're losing our autonomous nature.
We're gonna.

3102
02:25:18,470 --> 02:25:19,490
Eventually.
We're going to.

3103
02:25:19,970 --> 02:25:23,060
We're going to be controlled by 
everything that we have in our life.

3104
02:25:23,550 --> 02:25:24,190
You're not going to have

3105
02:25:24,190 --> 02:25:27,040
any freedom,
any freedom to move around.

3106
02:25:27,041 --> 02:25:27,874
You're going to get in your car.
It's going to take you on a path to 

3107
02:25:29,591 --> 02:25:31,300
work.
You're gonna punch in the data.

3108
02:25:31,600 --> 02:25:34,050
You'll be allowed to have your own car,
but nobody could drive anymore.

3109
02:25:34,070 --> 02:25:34,903
Well,
once we stopped letting people drive 

3110
02:25:36,221 --> 02:25:37,840
their own car,
I mean it was just.

3111
02:25:38,050 --> 02:25:39,610
First of all,
road rage,

3112
02:25:39,640 --> 02:25:40,473
death stopped.
That's one thing and it was worth it 

3113
02:25:42,460 --> 02:25:45,970
alone to lose that freedom.
you know why your road rage right?

3114
02:25:46,450 --> 02:25:47,440
In a way?
Road rage,

3115
02:25:48,760 --> 02:25:49,593
road rage,
because you're scared when you get in 

3116
02:25:51,511 --> 02:25:54,790
the car and you're going fast,
you're senses are heightened.

3117
02:25:54,820 --> 02:25:58,000
You know your senses are heightened.
Everything is dangerous.

3118
02:25:58,001 --> 02:26:00,820
You don't feel it because you feel like 
I'm just chilling going on the road,

3119
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:03,430
but you're super aware that you're going
fast.

3120
02:26:03,670 --> 02:26:05,380
You're super aware.
there's people around you.

3121
02:26:05,381 --> 02:26:06,790
They're also in these metal boxes.

3122
02:26:06,790 --> 02:26:09,250
You got to trust these idiots to stay in
your lane.

3123
02:26:09,490 --> 02:26:12,640
You're already on level eight,
so when someone gets in front of you,

3124
02:26:12,641 --> 02:26:13,474
even if it's like nothing,
that's why people don't get road rage 

3125
02:26:16,001 --> 02:26:16,834
when they're walking.
Like if you're walking in the mall and 

3126
02:26:18,821 --> 02:26:20,710
it's kind of a lot of people and someone
gets in front of you,

3127
02:26:20,711 --> 02:26:21,790
you can go,
fuck you.

3128
02:26:21,791 --> 02:26:22,624
Don't give a fuck at all.
Do you ever give a fuck if somebody 

3129
02:26:24,281 --> 02:26:26,680
walks past you and get them in front of 
you with the mall?

3130
02:26:26,920 --> 02:26:29,200
They're just walking down the hallway.
No one gives A shit.

3131
02:26:29,410 --> 02:26:31,210
Right,
but there's something about being in the

3132
02:26:31,211 --> 02:26:32,044
car that your senses are super 
heightened up because you're worried 

3133
02:26:34,301 --> 02:26:36,370
about the consequences of someone 
crashed into you.

3134
02:26:36,700 --> 02:26:38,260
So you're like,
fuck dude,

3135
02:26:38,350 --> 02:26:39,183
fuck box.
And that's where all that shit comes 

3136
02:26:41,651 --> 02:26:42,940
from.
And then you pull over bitch,

3137
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:45,850
pull over bitch.
Like that's where all that shit cut.

3138
02:26:46,030 --> 02:26:50,020
You'll fuck you think you.
Your life's on the line when it's really

3139
02:26:50,410 --> 02:26:51,243
a minor fender bender or a minor traffic
infraction or minor rudeness where 

3140
02:26:56,471 --> 02:26:58,810
someone cut you off were they didn't 
have to.

3141
02:26:58,840 --> 02:27:01,510
Maybe they could have waited a little 
bit and got behind you.

3142
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:03,650
That makes sense.
It just happen to me,

3143
02:27:03,651 --> 02:27:05,930
but when I left the other night after 
the fight companions,

3144
02:27:05,931 --> 02:27:07,010
like 2:00
in the morning,

3145
02:27:07,011 --> 02:27:07,844
I was almost home in hollywood.
Some cars were In front of a bar is 

3146
02:27:10,471 --> 02:27:11,600
there was a little.
You couldn't.

3147
02:27:11,780 --> 02:27:14,000
Some cars were blocking the two lanes of
road,

3148
02:27:14,001 --> 02:27:16,700
so everyone was merging over.
I merged over,

3149
02:27:16,970 --> 02:27:19,310
that guy behind me apparently thought I 
cut them off,

3150
02:27:19,311 --> 02:27:20,144
so we started getting up on my ass.
I could tell like the guy behind me is 

3151
02:27:22,011 --> 02:27:22,844
pissed.
I was getting that time so I started 

3152
02:27:24,081 --> 02:27:26,010
slowing down to just like let them go 
past me,

3153
02:27:26,020 --> 02:27:27,680
let I'm in a hurry,
go for it.

3154
02:27:27,950 --> 02:27:31,070
He just pulls up next to me and stops 
and starts cussing me out.

3155
02:27:31,080 --> 02:27:32,120
Middle finger,
all this and that.

3156
02:27:32,121 --> 02:27:33,650
I just thumbs up,
man.

3157
02:27:33,651 --> 02:27:35,000
Like I don't.
I'm not in a hurry.

3158
02:27:35,001 --> 02:27:36,740
I don't know where you're going.
I don't know why you're mad,

3159
02:27:36,741 --> 02:27:38,720
but I started thinking like,
oh shit,

3160
02:27:38,721 --> 02:27:39,554
he's going to follow me around the 
corner and it's going to have to get 

3161
02:27:40,581 --> 02:27:42,470
serious.
But he just went away.

3162
02:27:42,930 --> 02:27:46,020
Some people are just nuts and some 
people are angry at everything,

3163
02:27:46,440 --> 02:27:48,270
right?
They're angry at their wife.

3164
02:27:48,300 --> 02:27:50,970
They're angry at their job,
they're angry at their friend.

3165
02:27:50,971 --> 02:27:51,804
They're angry at their fucking 
neighborhood softball league that won't 

3166
02:27:56,011 --> 02:27:57,300
let theM pitch.
you know,

3167
02:27:57,301 --> 02:27:59,790
people are nuts.
You run into someone.

3168
02:27:59,791 --> 02:28:02,640
That's why like getting in those kinds 
of exchanges,

3169
02:28:03,660 --> 02:28:06,540
like over nothing over cars getting in 
front of you.

3170
02:28:06,720 --> 02:28:09,000
I state this chick,
she was hilarious.

3171
02:28:09,270 --> 02:28:11,670
She is very smart,
like super smart,

3172
02:28:12,270 --> 02:28:17,100
but she also would do occasionally she 
would do dumb,

3173
02:28:17,101 --> 02:28:19,740
reckless shit and one thing should do if
someone cut her off she'd be like,

3174
02:28:19,770 --> 02:28:20,603
fuck you,
and she can't find a car and cut them 

3175
02:28:23,481 --> 02:28:24,314
off.
It was totally contrary to her regular 

3176
02:28:26,091 --> 02:28:28,070
personality,
her regular personalities,

3177
02:28:28,090 --> 02:28:28,923
like super fun loving and she was always
smiling but there was something in her 

3178
02:28:33,081 --> 02:28:35,270
head about like someone cutting her off.

3179
02:28:35,300 --> 02:28:36,890
She was like,
fuck that,

3180
02:28:37,130 --> 02:28:37,963
and she would get in front of them and 
she cut this dude off and she had a 

3181
02:28:40,371 --> 02:28:42,890
convertible to little white convertible 
bmw.

3182
02:28:42,891 --> 02:28:43,360
I was like,
what?

3183
02:28:43,360 --> 02:28:44,690
What are You doing?
Like what are you doing?

3184
02:28:44,940 --> 02:28:47,120
Like you can't.
You can't just go around doing that.

3185
02:28:47,360 --> 02:28:50,540
Like you.
You've gotten lucky if you do that,

3186
02:28:50,541 --> 02:28:52,130
someone's going to do something terrible
to you.

3187
02:28:52,340 --> 02:28:57,170
Like do you know like this is a part of 
like the news road rage murders.

3188
02:28:57,171 --> 02:28:58,004
There was at one point in time,
la had a streak of them were it became 

3189
02:29:00,021 --> 02:29:00,854
trendy and there was people were just 
shooting each other on the freeway 

3190
02:29:03,980 --> 02:29:06,680
during traffic.
Like that scene from la story.

3191
02:29:06,681 --> 02:29:07,514
They made fun of it where he has a gun 
and it was mrs when I was a kid and I 

3192
02:29:11,631 --> 02:29:14,810
had heard and we would hear the news 
about road rage deaths.

3193
02:29:14,960 --> 02:29:15,793
There were always in California and 
there was people just shooting people 

3194
02:29:18,111 --> 02:29:20,240
like fucking crazy.
In California,

3195
02:29:21,920 --> 02:29:25,040
you just got to be careful.
You can't cut off the wrong person.

3196
02:29:25,610 --> 02:29:26,443
You can't like you can.
You could fuck up in those situations 

3197
02:29:30,680 --> 02:29:34,840
and you accidentally get killed like you
accidentally.

3198
02:29:34,910 --> 02:29:38,120
People kill people in road rage 
incidents all the time and I bet the guy

3199
02:29:38,121 --> 02:29:41,690
who kills the other guy probably regrets
it for the rest of his life.

3200
02:29:41,730 --> 02:29:42,563
90 nine point nine percent of the time,
but you just run into the wrong person 

3201
02:29:45,861 --> 02:29:47,930
at the wrong time and you stand your 
ground.

3202
02:29:47,931 --> 02:29:50,090
They stand their ground and next thing 
you know,

3203
02:29:50,091 --> 02:29:52,940
there's violence.
Unnecessary,

3204
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:55,340
stupid,
senseless violence.

3205
02:29:55,370 --> 02:29:59,060
There's too many gangsters in la,
especially like people that have way too

3206
02:29:59,061 --> 02:30:03,140
much money and gang violence and so you 
don't even know who you're fucking with.

3207
02:30:03,141 --> 02:30:06,590
like a prince shore that is a 
billionaire and he'll just like kill you

3208
02:30:06,591 --> 02:30:07,401
and just be like,
fuck it.

3209
02:30:07,401 --> 02:30:08,700
I'll just go,
you know,

3210
02:30:08,750 --> 02:30:13,750
go back to la has most road rage related
incidents in the us study finds.

3211
02:30:14,990 --> 02:30:16,190
Wow.
Of course,

3212
02:30:16,191 --> 02:30:17,840
I'm not surprised what's the numbers 
though?

3213
02:30:19,040 --> 02:30:22,640
Auto insurance center analyze $65,000.
Us on instagram.

3214
02:30:23,030 --> 02:30:23,870
Hashtag road,
rotary.

3215
02:30:23,950 --> 02:30:24,783
Chatswood lucky reporting of our 
detailed analysis of the situation by 

3216
02:30:32,781 --> 02:30:36,560
going to hashtag road rage.
I wrote this article five minutes before

3217
02:30:36,561 --> 02:30:39,770
I posted it and a fucking.
California is a lot.

3218
02:30:39,771 --> 02:30:42,920
You know what that means?
People just bitch in California.

3219
02:30:42,921 --> 02:30:44,810
Oh my god.
Fucking road rage.

3220
02:30:44,900 --> 02:30:45,733
It does say there's more than 1500 
people have been killed or injured in 

3221
02:30:48,021 --> 02:30:50,810
road rage incidents in the us over the 
last five years.

3222
02:30:51,350 --> 02:30:54,050
But what about California?
And it doesn't say that he's got to be.

3223
02:30:54,051 --> 02:30:57,490
There's gotta be like California road 
rage statistics for 2016.

3224
02:30:58,160 --> 02:30:58,993
I mean,
we have polIce chases multiple times a 

3225
02:31:00,231 --> 02:31:00,861
day.
I mean,

3226
02:31:00,861 --> 02:31:03,530
I'm watching them nonstop all day,
either the greatest.

3227
02:31:03,710 --> 02:31:07,340
Don't you think that what's going on 
with us though is that it's just so over

3228
02:31:07,341 --> 02:31:08,174
populated.
There's a real frustration that people 

3229
02:31:09,621 --> 02:31:10,454
have and that's also

3230
02:31:10,570 --> 02:31:11,403
part of the road rage.
So if you try to drive to orange county 

3231
02:31:14,710 --> 02:31:15,940
at 4:00
in the afternoon,

3232
02:31:15,941 --> 02:31:20,340
if you leave in downtown la and you try 
to make it down to like redondo beach,

3233
02:31:21,930 --> 02:31:22,763
good luck.
How many hours is that going to take at 

3234
02:31:24,661 --> 02:31:26,940
four.
If you leave at 4:30.

3235
02:31:27,120 --> 02:31:28,140
Oh,
you fucked up,

3236
02:31:28,141 --> 02:31:29,160
dude.
What time do you leave?

3237
02:31:29,161 --> 02:31:30,120
I left at five.
Oh,

3238
02:31:30,121 --> 02:31:33,230
two.
How long did you take you to get home?

3239
02:31:33,250 --> 02:31:36,090
Three hours.
I got three hours in the car.

3240
02:31:36,120 --> 02:31:37,920
that's normal.
That happens.

3241
02:31:38,700 --> 02:31:40,530
That can happen.
Do you want to go to newport beach?

3242
02:31:40,550 --> 02:31:42,960
You want to.
You don't want to live in newport beach,

3243
02:31:42,961 --> 02:31:47,961
but work in downtown la.
There's still many of us.

3244
02:31:49,330 --> 02:31:52,540
There was a.
I had to go to culver city wherever sony

3245
02:31:52,541 --> 02:31:54,310
studios is and all that.
It's at culver city.

3246
02:31:54,730 --> 02:31:57,130
I had to go there the other day at like 
two in the afternoon.

3247
02:31:57,131 --> 02:31:57,964
Now on paper it's like seven miles from 
my house or something like that or like 

3248
02:32:01,210 --> 02:32:02,043
it took me an hour and 20 minutes to get
there the other day and it's literally 

3249
02:32:05,740 --> 02:32:10,060
like seven to 10 hours for my h or s 
seven to 10 miles from my house.

3250
02:32:10,120 --> 02:32:11,050
Yeah,
you

3251
02:32:11,050 --> 02:32:12,400
could almost walk there.
Yeah.

3252
02:32:12,430 --> 02:32:14,470
That's quick.
Yeah.

3253
02:32:15,040 --> 02:32:15,873
Yeah.
I mean if you walked how many miles now 

3254
02:32:17,131 --> 02:32:17,964
and he walk five.
I think if I were on a bicycle I could 

3255
02:32:19,990 --> 02:32:22,000
got it half the time.
I bet.

3256
02:32:23,670 --> 02:32:24,760
Yeah,
for sure.

3257
02:32:24,820 --> 02:32:27,880
A bike fOr sure.
If you didn't get killed by someone with

3258
02:32:27,881 --> 02:32:31,540
road rage in a fucking fuck you with 
some other guy drunk.

3259
02:32:32,300 --> 02:32:33,133
fuck.
You cutting each other off and you just 

3260
02:32:34,931 --> 02:32:37,300
get clipped.
You go flying through the air.

3261
02:32:38,740 --> 02:32:40,750
People are angry.
It's too many of us,

3262
02:32:40,810 --> 02:32:41,643
but meanwhile you get in a plane,
you fly over the country like a space 

3263
02:32:44,400 --> 02:32:49,400
while we all huddled up while we fucking
huddled up so much because the ocean,

3264
02:32:51,280 --> 02:32:52,113
we need to figure out a way to get the 
fucking salt out of the ocean in big 

3265
02:32:55,481 --> 02:32:57,820
pipes.
Pump it to the middle where everything's

3266
02:32:57,821 --> 02:33:00,070
dry and let's fix this.

3267
02:33:00,460 --> 02:33:02,560
We do have a lot of desalinization 
plants.

3268
02:33:02,561 --> 02:33:05,490
If you look it up,
it's a super expensive and slow.

3269
02:33:05,910 --> 02:33:08,020
They're not that efficient.
It's a very difficult process.

3270
02:33:08,021 --> 02:33:09,760
It's very expensive.
It's not worth it,

3271
02:33:10,090 --> 02:33:13,090
you know,
and even not worth it with water,

3272
02:33:13,180 --> 02:33:17,650
as jesse ventura was saying on before,
water being more expensive than oil.

3273
02:33:18,160 --> 02:33:20,020
It's still not worth it.
Take the salt out of the water.

3274
02:33:20,050 --> 02:33:20,883
That's how hard the process is.
It's kind of ironic right next to the 

3275
02:33:23,801 --> 02:33:24,910
water.
We had a water problem.

3276
02:33:25,150 --> 02:33:28,150
Fucking hilarious.
Really stop and thInk about it,

3277
02:33:29,110 --> 02:33:29,943
but the like when you're flying over and
you look down at like some of the big 

3278
02:33:34,391 --> 02:33:36,250
dry spots on the way to vegas,
like,

3279
02:33:36,251 --> 02:33:39,910
jesus,
can't you boIl the water out right now?

3280
02:33:40,030 --> 02:33:41,380
Kind of go ahead,
try it.

3281
02:33:42,310 --> 02:33:43,900
What am I thinking?
That boy not boil.

3282
02:33:44,230 --> 02:33:45,063
Boil spring water or pond water or lake 
water and you kill most of the shit 

3283
02:33:49,421 --> 02:33:50,254
that's in there.

3284
02:33:50,320 --> 02:33:52,180
There's some shit that can survive that 
though.

3285
02:33:52,300 --> 02:33:53,133
They have all these water filters that 
people take when they're like hardcore 

3286
02:33:55,181 --> 02:33:56,014
backpackers shit in it and drink it.
Most recently I got really into like 

3287
02:34:01,450 --> 02:34:05,470
hardcore backpackers because I was 
listening to this one podcast where they

3288
02:34:05,471 --> 02:34:07,270
were talking about the appalachian 
trail.

3289
02:34:07,650 --> 02:34:08,483
Have you ever heard of that?
Appalachian trail is a trail that goes 

3290
02:34:10,901 --> 02:34:13,720
from Georgia all the way to Maine and 
they walk.

3291
02:34:13,721 --> 02:34:16,060
It takes five months.
That's crazy.

3292
02:34:16,061 --> 02:34:16,894
Yeah,
and they wear the clothes the entire 

3293
02:34:18,671 --> 02:34:20,350
time.
They live off their backpack.

3294
02:34:20,860 --> 02:34:22,930
I mean I was listening to you talk about
it.

3295
02:34:22,931 --> 02:34:24,060
I'm like,
that is nuts,

3296
02:34:24,070 --> 02:34:27,010
man.
That has a nutty way to live.

3297
02:34:27,011 --> 02:34:27,844
Like that's how crazy accomplishment.
I mean people think they're bad ass by 

3298
02:34:30,191 --> 02:34:33,940
doing a marathon do to run 26 miles.
Took me four hours,

3299
02:34:33,941 --> 02:34:34,774
but I've perseverance now.
These people are walking to main and 

3300
02:34:38,880 --> 02:34:39,680
it's one of those things.

3301
02:34:39,680 --> 02:34:42,910
Once you start something like that,
like you're kind of committed to it,

3302
02:34:43,180 --> 02:34:44,850
you're kind of committed to the stupid 
thing.

3303
02:34:44,851 --> 02:34:47,410
It's going to take five months.
Fringes did not the whole thing,

3304
02:34:47,411 --> 02:34:49,540
but he was just there for a part of it 
for five days.

3305
02:34:49,541 --> 02:34:53,260
Like last weekend I think he was a 
marine but they just went and camped and

3306
02:34:53,270 --> 02:34:57,880
you just put up facebook message like 
I'm in a hammock but it's 37 degrees.

3307
02:34:57,890 --> 02:34:58,723
It's raining and we're fucked.
But the point was they don't know where 

3308
02:35:02,561 --> 02:35:03,394
they're getting their water from,
so a lot of them bring filters and they 

3309
02:35:06,311 --> 02:35:07,144
have these things that they hang there.
There's a bunch of different kinds of 

3310
02:35:09,461 --> 02:35:11,980
filters.
Some of them actually are straws and you

3311
02:35:11,981 --> 02:35:12,814
can take it and you actually dip into a 
pond and suck it through the straw and 

3312
02:35:15,851 --> 02:35:19,480
you can drink it and then they have 
other ones where they're gravity filters

3313
02:35:19,510 --> 02:35:22,240
and they have these like buckets and all
this shit.

3314
02:35:22,500 --> 02:35:23,333
If it gets filtered out of the water and
then it comes down to it comes out 

3315
02:35:25,181 --> 02:35:27,010
clear.
It's really interesting man,

3316
02:35:27,011 --> 02:35:27,844
because these people are using like the 
best state of the art survival 

3317
02:35:32,561 --> 02:35:35,650
technology,
like that kind of shit and just drinking

3318
02:35:35,651 --> 02:35:37,630
out of ponds and stuff.
Yeah.

3319
02:35:38,680 --> 02:35:39,513
Yeah.
I saw the [inaudible] where they like 

3320
02:35:40,330 --> 02:35:43,120
the ceo goes,
now watch this is urine and it makes it.

3321
02:35:43,270 --> 02:35:44,200
Shrinks it.
Yeah.

3322
02:35:44,201 --> 02:35:46,030
But you can drink piss.
Pisses new.

3323
02:35:46,031 --> 02:35:47,560
Taste that bad.
I know.

3324
02:35:47,860 --> 02:35:51,030
It's nothing.
I drank my own piss a bunch of times.

3325
02:35:51,100 --> 02:35:54,370
There's a video of you drink and piss on
the internet of me and this dude,

3326
02:35:54,371 --> 02:35:55,204
no name because someone had told me that
drink in your own piss was like really 

3327
02:35:59,081 --> 02:35:59,914
good.
Had vitamins and minerals in it isn't 

3328
02:36:01,610 --> 02:36:03,480
it's stuff that came out of your body.
Yeah.

3329
02:36:03,760 --> 02:36:06,160
The fighter guy.
This is about a bunch of them,

3330
02:36:06,161 --> 02:36:06,994
a bunch of people.

3331
02:36:07,150 --> 02:36:07,983
Leo machida did it.
He was like kind of famous for drinking 

3332
02:36:10,241 --> 02:36:13,330
your own business and so I will.
What the fuck is this about?

3333
02:36:13,331 --> 02:36:17,020
And I drank it a couple of times and uh,
I was thinking after I drank it,

3334
02:36:17,021 --> 02:36:18,760
I can't believe I just drank my piss.
Like,

3335
02:36:18,761 --> 02:36:21,620
what the fuck is wrong with me?
Yeah,

3336
02:36:22,180 --> 02:36:23,260
yeah,
me and that dude.

3337
02:36:24,010 --> 02:36:29,010
So we both just whipped it out and peed 
in the cup and then we make.

3338
02:36:30,520 --> 02:36:32,920
That's the dude incidentally.
It's no name.

3339
02:36:33,040 --> 02:36:34,480
That's the dude who,
uh,

3340
02:36:34,540 --> 02:36:37,870
introduced me to a nootropics,
believe it or not.

3341
02:36:38,470 --> 02:36:39,303
How ironic.
Inappropriate when we're about to do 

3342
02:36:40,871 --> 02:36:45,871
something really stupid because we feed 
in there.

3343
02:36:50,950 --> 02:36:52,660
We clicked it,
I just download it.

3344
02:36:54,650 --> 02:36:55,483
But you know what man,
I've been working on fear factor for so 

3345
02:36:58,641 --> 02:37:01,970
long and he couldn't do it,
man.

3346
02:37:01,971 --> 02:37:04,880
He was hurl and don't be a pussy.
Damn,

3347
02:37:04,930 --> 02:37:07,670
that's what I'm talking about.
Don't make deal

3348
02:37:21,830 --> 02:37:23,780
old school,
old school.

3349
02:37:24,080 --> 02:37:24,913
Um,
I don't know why point was about 

3350
02:37:25,940 --> 02:37:26,631
drinking piss.
Oh,

3351
02:37:26,631 --> 02:37:28,280
it's not that big a deal.
It's all in your head.

3352
02:37:28,370 --> 02:37:30,320
It's like eating roaches.
Same thing.

3353
02:37:30,350 --> 02:37:31,183
It's all in your head.
Like there's a lot of bugs that we 

3354
02:37:32,841 --> 02:37:34,010
serve.
People on fear factor.

3355
02:37:34,011 --> 02:37:36,650
They didn't taste bad at all.
They barely tasted like anything.

3356
02:37:37,160 --> 02:37:38,810
Like spiders,
a bunch of spiders.

3357
02:37:38,811 --> 02:37:39,531
We ate,
you know,

3358
02:37:39,531 --> 02:37:42,080
spiders are um,
they're cousins of crabs,

3359
02:37:42,650 --> 02:37:45,020
lobsters and shit.
You know,

3360
02:37:45,350 --> 02:37:46,520
oysters taste bad.

3361
02:37:46,840 --> 02:37:49,150
Oysters are,
is amazing that we eat oysters.

3362
02:37:49,151 --> 02:37:49,984
Like just pulling them out of the ocean,
you can just open them up and just like 

3363
02:37:52,871 --> 02:37:53,810
sucked down this

3364
02:37:54,180 --> 02:37:57,360
slimy vagina.
It is kinda like that,

3365
02:37:57,930 --> 02:37:59,000
you know what?

3366
02:37:59,490 --> 02:38:00,323
As I said,
do you know how lobsters switched from 

3367
02:38:00,971 --> 02:38:03,940
being like a,
I don't want to say poor people's food,

3368
02:38:03,941 --> 02:38:06,640
but I thought that's what it was.
I didn't make the change.

3369
02:38:06,980 --> 02:38:07,813
Well,
um,

3370
02:38:07,910 --> 02:38:11,750
it all happened when lobsters used to be
like a bar food.

3371
02:38:12,170 --> 02:38:14,660
They used to go to the east river and 
the turn of the century,

3372
02:38:14,810 --> 02:38:15,643
I think it was like in the 18 hundreds 
of the early 19 hundreds and they would 

3373
02:38:19,040 --> 02:38:19,873
cast out for lobsters and catch them and
feed them to people that were like 

3374
02:38:22,370 --> 02:38:23,203
hungry at bars.
And it was taught to be like garbage 

3375
02:38:25,371 --> 02:38:26,204
food.
Somewhere along the line probably the 

3376
02:38:27,951 --> 02:38:30,380
supplied dwindled because they overfish 
them.

3377
02:38:30,980 --> 02:38:31,813
Who knows?
I don't know.

3378
02:38:31,920 --> 02:38:32,753
I don't know who.
I was reading this thing about diamonds 

3379
02:38:34,551 --> 02:38:38,660
the other day and how they managed to 
keep diamond super valuable when they're

3380
02:38:38,661 --> 02:38:39,494
not really rare anymore.
It was fascinating that they recognize 

3381
02:38:42,321 --> 02:38:43,154
it coming and that diamond production up
until the time they discovered these 

3382
02:38:46,581 --> 02:38:47,414
mines in South Africa,
I think it was diamond production was 

3383
02:38:50,001 --> 02:38:51,620
very small,
few pounds a year,

3384
02:38:51,740 --> 02:38:54,770
and then all of a sudden they just hit 
the motherload.

3385
02:38:54,980 --> 02:38:56,690
They just found so many diamonds.
They realize,

3386
02:38:56,691 --> 02:38:58,340
oh my god,
diamonds are just weird,

3387
02:38:58,640 --> 02:39:01,610
like they're not valuable.
So they formed this giant group,

3388
02:39:01,611 --> 02:39:03,530
the debaters group,
and they said,

3389
02:39:03,531 --> 02:39:04,364
well,
just hoard all these fucking diamonds 

3390
02:39:05,151 --> 02:39:08,510
control all the diamond mining.
We decide that they're still valuable,

3391
02:39:09,050 --> 02:39:09,883
so because they don't release them,
but they keep mining them and so they 

3392
02:39:12,021 --> 02:39:15,590
have way more diamonds than they sell.
Like the amount of diamonds,

3393
02:39:15,591 --> 02:39:16,424
the diamonds they sell,
and then diamonds are worth a fuck load 

3394
02:39:18,861 --> 02:39:20,180
of money.
So they.

3395
02:39:20,220 --> 02:39:21,230
They're rare,
right?

3396
02:39:21,320 --> 02:39:22,790
They split,
they sell them all the time.

3397
02:39:22,840 --> 02:39:24,830
They sell them as if they're rare,
but they couldn't be rare.

3398
02:39:24,831 --> 02:39:26,780
If there were that rare,
you wouldn't be selling so many of them.

3399
02:39:27,050 --> 02:39:27,883
Like how many do you have?
They essentially have an unlimited 

3400
02:39:28,971 --> 02:39:31,150
supply of diamonds,
but they're making an outline.

3401
02:39:31,200 --> 02:39:32,033
Times are so rare.
It's so rare that we found this diamond 

3402
02:39:35,010 --> 02:39:35,431
like,
bitch,

3403
02:39:35,431 --> 02:39:37,350
you got a lot of them.
You got warehouses full of them.

3404
02:39:37,500 --> 02:39:41,610
It's kind of like the sunglasses and 
glasses industry are all owned,

3405
02:39:41,611 --> 02:39:43,800
like all the known,
like ray bans,

3406
02:39:43,801 --> 02:39:46,050
oakleys,
they're all owned by one company,

3407
02:39:46,080 --> 02:39:46,913
so they.
So like glasses shouldn't be that 

3408
02:39:48,751 --> 02:39:50,840
expensive or sunglass shouldn't be that 
expensive.

3409
02:39:50,841 --> 02:39:54,720
It's a lot of sunglass companies do and 
they are all owned by the same company.

3410
02:39:54,721 --> 02:39:55,920
If you should,
if you look it up,

3411
02:39:55,921 --> 02:39:57,330
there's a company.
How many,

3412
02:39:57,360 --> 02:39:58,810
how many different.
There's got to be competitive.

3413
02:39:58,811 --> 02:40:00,630
It's the same thing.
You watch those on a tv show,

3414
02:40:00,631 --> 02:40:04,050
that guy like a whole big breakdown,
big video of the whole thing.

3415
02:40:04,080 --> 02:40:05,110
I'll look it up.
But uh,

3416
02:40:06,060 --> 02:40:09,630
even what's weird is that like companies
held out like oakley was like,

3417
02:40:09,760 --> 02:40:12,120
no,
we're not gonna.

3418
02:40:12,460 --> 02:40:13,440
We're gonna to

3419
02:40:14,390 --> 02:40:15,230
africa.
What happened?

3420
02:40:15,231 --> 02:40:16,110
It's like the store was like,
no,

3421
02:40:16,130 --> 02:40:18,330
we don't want to carry this brand 
because they won't,

3422
02:40:18,390 --> 02:40:20,710
they're not a part of our company.
And then,

3423
02:40:20,730 --> 02:40:21,563
uh,
then they just ended up buying oakley 

3424
02:40:23,190 --> 02:40:24,023
and then raising the price.
Like ray bands used to be cheap glasses 

3425
02:40:26,910 --> 02:40:27,743
and then when they bought ray ban,
they pumped it up to like now you can 

3426
02:40:30,341 --> 02:40:32,930
buy a ray ban and like 200 bucks for.
Yeah.

3427
02:40:33,300 --> 02:40:34,133
And what did they used to be?
They used to be just like the cheap 

3428
02:40:35,701 --> 02:40:38,790
glasses,
like a $10 glass or something like that.

3429
02:40:38,860 --> 02:40:39,693
Turns out a single company control 
several of the outlets where you buy 

3430
02:40:42,780 --> 02:40:44,340
eyeglasses.
Okay.

3431
02:40:44,341 --> 02:40:46,530
So they control the outlets,
but did they own the company?

3432
02:40:46,531 --> 02:40:48,000
Yes.
And they have on the company.

3433
02:40:48,001 --> 02:40:52,170
So they also own lens crafters.
They also own sunglass hut or any of the

3434
02:40:52,171 --> 02:40:54,780
sunglass stores.
They own everything.

3435
02:40:55,200 --> 02:40:56,610
That's pretty slick,
right?

3436
02:40:56,611 --> 02:40:57,470
Because how many people

3437
02:40:57,520 --> 02:40:58,353
buy sunglasses from those sunglass huts?
That's where a lot of people buy them 

3438
02:41:02,710 --> 02:41:03,543
right statement to snopes.com.
The company said it's sales account for 

3439
02:41:08,171 --> 02:41:11,770
only 10 percent of the frame sold 
worldwide's shouldn't snopes.com

3440
02:41:11,771 --> 02:41:12,341
did.
However,

3441
02:41:12,341 --> 02:41:14,830
conclude that regardless of the actual 
figure,

3442
02:41:14,831 --> 02:41:15,664
much of adam's ruins everything's 
assessment of luxottica's market 

3443
02:41:19,631 --> 02:41:21,760
dominance was accurate.
Okay,

3444
02:41:21,761 --> 02:41:22,594
so that's that.
Adam ruins everything show interesting 

3445
02:41:24,310 --> 02:41:25,540
fucking show.
I love that guy.

3446
02:41:25,720 --> 02:41:26,140
Yeah,
it's,

3447
02:41:26,140 --> 02:41:28,570
it's an interesting show.
It's a,

3448
02:41:28,600 --> 02:41:31,390
some of the stuff that he gets on it.
It's really a really,

3449
02:41:31,880 --> 02:41:35,560
it's a well measured take that some 
people disagree with.

3450
02:41:36,100 --> 02:41:36,933
But um,
there was one that steven crowder just 

3451
02:41:41,621 --> 02:41:45,610
was mocking one and he had some really 
good points.

3452
02:41:45,770 --> 02:41:47,780
Car dealership is one of my favorite 
episodes.

3453
02:41:47,781 --> 02:41:50,540
I had no idea about car dealerships.
It was about illegal

3454
02:41:50,810 --> 02:41:51,643
ration and he was talking about how the 
fence wouldn't help and the fence 

3455
02:41:55,581 --> 02:41:56,414
wouldn't help because only I think it 
was like a certain percentage of the 

3456
02:42:04,011 --> 02:42:07,550
people that got into the country came to
the country by foot.

3457
02:42:09,040 --> 02:42:13,250
It was something like only like 60,
60 percent came in by foot.

3458
02:42:13,520 --> 02:42:14,720
So the idea was like,
wait a minute,

3459
02:42:15,260 --> 02:42:16,093
see if you could find it.
This is interesting statistics because 

3460
02:42:18,831 --> 02:42:21,110
it means a lot of people came in by 
foot.

3461
02:42:21,320 --> 02:42:23,240
Like yeah,
fence would definitely stop that.

3462
02:42:23,241 --> 02:42:26,180
Like it wouldn't stop everything,
but by the own,

3463
02:42:26,210 --> 02:42:27,043
the definition of the own show explored,
it would stop a large number of people 

3464
02:42:31,930 --> 02:42:32,700
you see it.

3465
02:42:32,700 --> 02:42:34,450
But it probably just changed people 
video.

3466
02:42:34,500 --> 02:42:36,780
But I'm trying to find the,
the numbers.

3467
02:42:37,290 --> 02:42:39,840
So that's 60 percent.
I don't know what the numbers are.

3468
02:42:39,910 --> 02:42:40,743
You go,
if you go to louder with crowder is 

3469
02:42:41,401 --> 02:42:42,234
website explains it in the,
the not just in the video but in the 

3470
02:42:44,911 --> 02:42:47,130
actual description of the video.
It has the numbers.

3471
02:42:47,400 --> 02:42:49,170
So yeah.
Wouldn't that 60 percent though?

3472
02:42:49,200 --> 02:42:50,880
Like if there was a wall just fly,
go.

3473
02:42:50,910 --> 02:42:52,080
Well I guess we have to fly now.

3474
02:42:52,530 --> 02:42:55,020
It's not that easy to fly though.
It's super hard to fly.

3475
02:42:55,021 --> 02:42:57,200
The idea is that it's really easy to 
walk across that stage.

3476
02:42:57,230 --> 02:43:00,510
The idea that offense would help.
But here's something even weirder.

3477
02:43:00,780 --> 02:43:01,613
Pete,
dominick.

3478
02:43:01,830 --> 02:43:04,260
Pete dominick from the stand up with 
pete dominick,

3479
02:43:04,261 --> 02:43:07,980
I think radio show on sirius.
I think that's what this show is called.

3480
02:43:08,070 --> 02:43:10,260
Forgive me if I'm wrong.
He um,

3481
02:43:10,470 --> 02:43:12,010
he was saying the actual

3482
02:43:12,010 --> 02:43:14,770
amount of mexicans that immigrate to the
United States,

3483
02:43:14,771 --> 02:43:15,880
like the net amount and.
No,

3484
02:43:15,881 --> 02:43:17,320
they go back and forth.
Who goes here?

3485
02:43:17,321 --> 02:43:18,154
Who there is zero.
It's like it's even like the same 

3486
02:43:22,001 --> 02:43:23,260
amount.
Go over there as,

3487
02:43:23,261 --> 02:43:24,094
come over here.

3488
02:43:25,860 --> 02:43:26,693
Yeah.
But how do they know that in plus are 

3489
02:43:28,500 --> 02:43:29,333
all those people just killed?
Like are people that go down there to 

3490
02:43:31,430 --> 02:43:35,250
murder?
It depends on where they're going.

3491
02:43:35,280 --> 02:43:36,950
Right.
What do you got there?

3492
02:43:36,951 --> 02:43:37,784
Jamie doesn't have anything.
He just has a three paragraphs of like 

3493
02:43:41,810 --> 02:43:44,280
his opinion of what the video is talking
about.

3494
02:43:44,530 --> 02:43:47,530
Does it have anything with numbers?
No numbers at all?

3495
02:43:47,590 --> 02:43:48,423
No.
Okay.

3496
02:43:49,090 --> 02:43:49,923
Well he explains it in the,
if you like play the beginning of the 

3497
02:43:52,751 --> 02:43:55,150
clip,
it explains it in the clip.

3498
02:43:55,160 --> 02:43:57,400
It gets to it pretty quickly.
It's kind of interesting.

3499
02:43:58,570 --> 02:44:02,680
Why don't you just play it?
It's kind of interesting because it gets

3500
02:44:02,681 --> 02:44:04,720
to the,
the weird numbers of it pretty quick.

3501
02:44:04,721 --> 02:44:06,970
We can get this taken off without his 
permission.

3502
02:44:07,390 --> 02:44:09,250
Can we play?
It's only brian and I can hear it.

3503
02:44:10,540 --> 02:44:13,570
Sorry fuckers.
I'll reenact what he says.

3504
02:44:16,660 --> 02:44:20,880
Okay.
What'd you do?

3505
02:44:22,160 --> 02:44:23,280
Go to the beginning please.

3506
02:44:24,450 --> 02:44:26,340
It's a 32nd intro for.

3507
02:44:34,800 --> 02:44:38,460
Okay.
Twenty 40 percent came here on planes.

3508
02:44:39,120 --> 02:44:40,030
Okay.
Kill it.

3509
02:44:40,080 --> 02:44:41,760
You can kill it.
That's all I wanted to hear.

3510
02:44:42,030 --> 02:44:46,020
So that's 27 to 40 percent of the people
came here on planes.

3511
02:44:46,320 --> 02:44:51,320
That means that between 60 and 73 
percent came here walking like.

3512
02:44:54,241 --> 02:44:56,430
How would you say that?
A fence is not going to stop that.

3513
02:44:56,460 --> 02:44:58,200
We're in a car.
Yes.

3514
02:44:58,460 --> 02:45:00,360
Which will.
Which even if we had a wall,

3515
02:45:00,361 --> 02:45:04,470
we mexicans are still allowed to come to
the United States to go on vacation,

3516
02:45:04,471 --> 02:45:05,304
aren't sure.
Yeah,

3517
02:45:05,400 --> 02:45:06,870
and that's all they're gonna do it.

3518
02:45:07,660 --> 02:45:08,493
They have one shot.
If especially if I don't know how it 

3519
02:45:11,501 --> 02:45:12,334
works,
like how you can get a visa or how you 

3520
02:45:13,451 --> 02:45:14,590
don't get a visa to visit

3521
02:45:15,140 --> 02:45:17,330
some countries.
Some countries are harder,

3522
02:45:17,331 --> 02:45:19,310
but Mexico,
the United States ain't that hard.

3523
02:45:19,340 --> 02:45:20,173
But going into like philippinEs,
like trying to get it can I try to 

3524
02:45:22,430 --> 02:45:24,820
remember them when I tried to rescue a 
filipino woman,

3525
02:45:24,830 --> 02:45:29,060
but she was killed by that tsunami.
I Tried to get her visa and it was like,

3526
02:45:29,061 --> 02:45:30,780
oh no,
you have to wait in line.

3527
02:45:30,810 --> 02:45:31,643
You have to like six months you won't 
get approved because they know they're 

3528
02:45:34,191 --> 02:45:35,690
not coming back to the Philippines.

3529
02:45:35,790 --> 02:45:38,130
That's a lot of people from a lot of 
parts of the world.

3530
02:45:38,160 --> 02:45:38,993
If you're in a really,
really super poor part of the world and 

3531
02:45:40,441 --> 02:45:43,670
you get a shot at trying to eek it out 
here in the United States,

3532
02:45:43,690 --> 02:45:45,360
like fuck it,
I'll take a chance here.

3533
02:45:45,540 --> 02:45:48,060
You can establish a life over here over 
long periods of time,

3534
02:45:49,020 --> 02:45:52,590
man.
Yeah,

3535
02:45:52,940 --> 02:45:54,600
I guess you could just come over and 
visit.

3536
02:45:54,750 --> 02:45:56,700
Pretty easy.
I mean there's a road there.

3537
02:45:56,701 --> 02:46:00,140
They have to find a reason why you can't
come over and visit video.

3538
02:46:00,150 --> 02:46:03,300
I saw recently people climbing the 
fence.

3539
02:46:03,320 --> 02:46:03,500
Yeah.

3540
02:46:03,500 --> 02:46:06,650
And then they take the kind of stocks 
and notice they're caught on camera.

3541
02:46:06,740 --> 02:46:08,090
So they run and climbed back over.

3542
02:46:09,340 --> 02:46:10,030
well they've got

3543
02:46:10,030 --> 02:46:13,150
backpacks on.
They look over at the camera.

3544
02:46:15,490 --> 02:46:17,360
The guy got a cell phone near his ear.
Yeah.

3545
02:46:17,950 --> 02:46:21,300
I assume there are drug runners,
but I don't know that that's necessarily

3546
02:46:21,470 --> 02:46:24,740
because they have those backpacks so 
they climbed back over again.

3547
02:46:24,860 --> 02:46:25,760
It's that easy.

3548
02:46:25,860 --> 02:46:27,030
Skip,
I'll skip ahead.

3549
02:46:27,031 --> 02:46:27,420
But

3550
02:46:27,420 --> 02:46:30,060
holy shit.
Border patrol.

3551
02:46:30,390 --> 02:46:31,980
So border patrol season.

3552
02:46:32,640 --> 02:46:33,830
So they're hanging out for a minute.

3553
02:46:34,150 --> 02:46:36,340
Wow.
So then the United States right now they

3554
02:46:36,341 --> 02:46:38,030
got walkie talkies dude.
Oh,

3555
02:46:38,060 --> 02:46:39,820
they see that.
Don't know.

3556
02:46:39,850 --> 02:46:41,980
Grab in.
No good.

3557
02:46:41,981 --> 02:46:42,641
I've been,
yeah,

3558
02:46:42,641 --> 02:46:45,130
they're talking and then they're 
covering their face.

3559
02:46:46,480 --> 02:46:51,480
Wow.
Wow.

3560
02:46:51,870 --> 02:46:54,470
It's so easy to climb.
That was easy

3561
02:46:55,150 --> 02:46:58,070
clock showing you how fast it takes to 
take 10 seconds.

3562
02:46:58,750 --> 02:47:01,420
Holy shit.
Those dudes are like,

3563
02:47:02,310 --> 02:47:03,143
they're like little acrobats to be able 
to have that kind of hand strength to 

3564
02:47:06,790 --> 02:47:08,890
pin down those things and climate like 
that.

3565
02:47:09,190 --> 02:47:10,023
That's pretty fucking impressive.
So they're just holding onto those 

3566
02:47:13,711 --> 02:47:14,430
things,
right?

3567
02:47:14,430 --> 02:47:16,050
Yeah.
Wow.

3568
02:47:16,980 --> 02:47:19,890
That's interesting.
Is that the news caster catching them?

3569
02:47:20,510 --> 02:47:22,740
Look at that.
Pretty god.

3570
02:47:23,960 --> 02:47:24,793
Oh,
she's.

3571
02:47:24,870 --> 02:47:27,600
She's very angry.
They were on the wrong side of the dirt.

3572
02:47:28,770 --> 02:47:29,670
Wow.
Yeah.

3573
02:47:29,671 --> 02:47:31,170
Imagine if you're on the wrong side of 
the dirt.

3574
02:47:31,320 --> 02:47:34,710
You're looking at all those nice people 
hanging around corpus christi,

3575
02:47:35,550 --> 02:47:38,400
partying it up down here,
dodging bullets,

3576
02:47:38,970 --> 02:47:39,803
going fucking bull fights and shit.
It's fucking weird that we just decide 

3577
02:47:45,121 --> 02:47:47,130
that people are born in the wrong batch 
of dirt.

3578
02:47:47,260 --> 02:47:49,510
Drives me crazy.
Especially with the mexicans.

3579
02:47:49,511 --> 02:47:51,610
I just love all my mexican friends and 
everything like that.

3580
02:47:51,611 --> 02:47:53,380
And the fact that like,
you know,

3581
02:47:53,470 --> 02:47:55,750
like trump just pisses me off when it 
comes to that.

3582
02:47:56,230 --> 02:47:57,000
He's a string,

3583
02:47:57,000 --> 02:47:59,790
man.
This thing's very strange.

3584
02:48:00,540 --> 02:48:01,373
I just have the crazy feelings.
This is like the last gasps of this 

3585
02:48:04,371 --> 02:48:05,204
silly system.
It's going to take a few more election 

3586
02:48:07,591 --> 02:48:10,920
cycles before completely mpo implodes.
Some,

3587
02:48:10,950 --> 02:48:11,783
some disasters occurrence has to take 
place for someone comes up with an 

3588
02:48:14,521 --> 02:48:18,900
alternative method that people embrace.
Let's got to be something like it's not.

3589
02:48:19,210 --> 02:48:21,750
It's just not going to keep going like 
this and can't,

3590
02:48:22,680 --> 02:48:24,750
you know,
this is why we're down to these two.

3591
02:48:25,320 --> 02:48:26,430
Nobody wants that gig.

3592
02:48:27,020 --> 02:48:29,420
It's going to be how long until it's a 
computer program.

3593
02:48:30,930 --> 02:48:32,900
It's probably not the worst idea.
Twenty years.

3594
02:48:32,901 --> 02:48:33,734
Yeah.
You have a siri that's just is common 

3595
02:48:35,331 --> 02:48:36,164
sense.
It looks up facts and figures and it 

3596
02:48:38,450 --> 02:48:40,610
tells you what the best answer is that 
that situation.

3597
02:48:40,640 --> 02:48:40,820
Well,

3598
02:48:40,820 --> 02:48:41,653
not only that may be instead of you just
sitting down and making one impulsive 

3599
02:48:45,651 --> 02:48:48,140
choice as to who's going to be the 
leader of the free world.

3600
02:48:48,500 --> 02:48:52,610
Maybe if you want to participate in 
choosing the next leader,

3601
02:48:52,640 --> 02:48:56,330
you have to interface with the system 
and then asked to talk to you about your

3602
02:48:56,331 --> 02:48:57,164
wants and your needs and desires and 
they try to find a solution that's 

3603
02:49:00,951 --> 02:49:01,784
mutually compatible with ethics and the 
desires of all the people that are 

3604
02:49:04,491 --> 02:49:05,324
attached to the system so they run the 
desires of all the people that are 

3605
02:49:08,491 --> 02:49:09,324
attached to the system through some sort
of ethics program where they try to 

3606
02:49:11,941 --> 02:49:12,774
think about what's important and what's 
unimportant and where people are just 

3607
02:49:15,001 --> 02:49:15,834
being bitches and where people are being
lazy and where people are being too 

3608
02:49:18,991 --> 02:49:22,170
controlling and where and just figure 
out,

3609
02:49:22,530 --> 02:49:27,530
figure out a way that you can concoct a 
system of government where a.

3610
02:49:28,080 --> 02:49:28,913
Nobody's profiting from being in charge 
and as soon as people say they won't do 

3611
02:49:32,221 --> 02:49:33,054
that because there's just too many 
people that profit from being in charge 

3612
02:49:34,921 --> 02:49:38,220
and gigantic way.
So it's too valuable to be in charge.

3613
02:49:38,610 --> 02:49:41,580
It's not something you get off on doing 
just because you did a great job.

3614
02:49:41,600 --> 02:49:46,140
It's something you get off on doing 
because you used it in a personal way to

3615
02:49:46,141 --> 02:49:46,974
enrich your own bank account.
You've figured out a way to use these 

3616
02:49:50,641 --> 02:49:54,300
weird laws that you set up to suck a 
bunch of money out of the system.

3617
02:49:54,570 --> 02:49:56,460
That's what we're getting over and over 
and over again.

3618
02:49:56,940 --> 02:49:58,150
That's just all that's,
that's,

3619
02:49:58,280 --> 02:50:00,330
that's the reason why they're doing it 
in the first place.

3620
02:50:00,400 --> 02:50:01,233
Nobody else wants that gig.
You have to be like a crazy person with 

3621
02:50:04,931 --> 02:50:05,764
a,
uh,

3622
02:50:06,060 --> 02:50:06,893
an amazing view of yourself or you just 
got to grab them by the pussy grabbing 

3623
02:50:13,770 --> 02:50:15,490
grabbed by the pussy man.

3624
02:50:15,570 --> 02:50:16,403
But imagine if he wins magic.
We have a president that talks about 

3625
02:50:18,511 --> 02:50:21,060
grabbing chips by the posting.
I just so sick of him.

3626
02:50:21,300 --> 02:50:23,200
I just kept on it though.
It's kind of if,

3627
02:50:23,400 --> 02:50:25,980
if this is a simulation man,
they're ending it good.

3628
02:50:26,820 --> 02:50:30,780
It's coming down nice.
I'd love to see somebody.

3629
02:50:30,781 --> 02:50:33,240
I'd rather have kania then trump.
Yeah.

3630
02:50:33,241 --> 02:50:34,074
He's going to win next year.
It's gonna be jesse ventura versus 

3631
02:50:35,941 --> 02:50:36,774
conduit.
They might team up together to kanye 

3632
02:50:38,071 --> 02:50:38,904
smart,
make jesse his running mate because 

3633
02:50:40,111 --> 02:50:41,730
jesse like spent a lot of time,
Mexico,

3634
02:50:42,300 --> 02:50:43,133
make some sort of a joint agreement 
where president kanye takes care of the 

3635
02:50:46,140 --> 02:50:49,800
heavy lifting and then a vice president,
ventura,

3636
02:50:50,640 --> 02:50:51,473
he just works his fanny pack and hangs 
around Mexico and case needs me as calm 

3637
02:50:54,510 --> 02:50:55,343
on the phone because he doesn't have a 
cell phone at least to try to get 

3638
02:50:57,151 --> 02:51:01,470
somebody elected like one of our friends
like joey diaz or something next,

3639
02:51:02,230 --> 02:51:07,050
that's not going to work,
but it's almost coming down to that.

3640
02:51:07,110 --> 02:51:10,890
I mean the reason why kanye west really 
could be president is because it is kind

3641
02:51:10,891 --> 02:51:13,230
of almost coming down to a popularity 
contest,

3642
02:51:13,760 --> 02:51:14,593
so it's almost coming down to.
It doesn't necessarily have to be the 

3643
02:51:18,211 --> 02:51:19,044
person who could do the job best.
It's the person who the people love the 

3644
02:51:22,651 --> 02:51:25,020
most,
who they can convince themselves,

3645
02:51:25,021 --> 02:51:28,830
can do a good enough job or who the 
person can convince them,

3646
02:51:28,831 --> 02:51:31,800
but they'll do a good enough job.
It's not necessarily the best person for

3647
02:51:31,801 --> 02:51:33,870
the job.
A popular person,

3648
02:51:33,930 --> 02:51:38,520
like if a guy like kanye west and kanye 
and drake ran together for the children,

3649
02:51:39,630 --> 02:51:41,550
it might be they might win.
Man.

3650
02:51:41,820 --> 02:51:44,070
Kanye and jay z ran.
Okay.

3651
02:51:44,650 --> 02:51:47,700
What if nas runs for president nas and 
jay z?

3652
02:51:47,701 --> 02:51:49,260
It's a joint ticket.
Hey man,

3653
02:51:49,261 --> 02:51:52,680
I might fucking vote for them.
I might do that to nausea.

3654
02:51:52,700 --> 02:51:54,570
Smart dude.
Jay z is a smart dude.

3655
02:51:54,600 --> 02:51:56,400
Maybe they would come up with something 
that makes sense,

3656
02:51:56,970 --> 02:51:59,010
but then jay z did have that streaming 
music service.

3657
02:51:59,020 --> 02:52:00,780
That wasn't really good idea.
What it still does.

3658
02:52:00,790 --> 02:52:04,920
Doesn't he still do that?
People buy stuff tight,

3659
02:52:05,440 --> 02:52:06,240
didn't work.

3660
02:52:06,240 --> 02:52:09,880
I think they're trying to figure out how
to get bought by somebody else probably.

3661
02:52:09,881 --> 02:52:10,810
Right?
Yeah.

3662
02:52:11,710 --> 02:52:13,930
I mean he's just trying to make a buck.
Got to take a chance.

3663
02:52:14,440 --> 02:52:16,330
But anyway,
at the end of the day,

3664
02:52:16,540 --> 02:52:19,210
there's a lot of fucking smart people 
that are super popular is my point.

3665
02:52:19,600 --> 02:52:21,190
If you can get really,
really popular,

3666
02:52:21,220 --> 02:52:22,430
like george clooney,
me.

3667
02:52:22,440 --> 02:52:23,680
If george clooney didn't run for 
president,

3668
02:52:23,681 --> 02:52:26,530
he couldn't.
When george clooney can be the president

3669
02:52:26,531 --> 02:52:29,260
of this fucking country,
without a doubt,

3670
02:52:29,290 --> 02:52:33,050
ronald reagan even sampled when now the 
door's opened.

3671
02:52:33,070 --> 02:52:34,480
Alec baldwin.
Okay.

3672
02:52:34,690 --> 02:52:36,370
Because after all that,
grab the pussy stuff.

3673
02:52:36,580 --> 02:52:37,413
All that crazy shit that alec baldwin 
did screaming at people calling them 

3674
02:52:39,221 --> 02:52:40,054
faggots and shit.
No one's going to have to remember that 

3675
02:52:41,891 --> 02:52:43,240
anymore.
The daughter stuff was terrible.

3676
02:52:43,241 --> 02:52:43,870
Yeah,
the daughter.

3677
02:52:43,870 --> 02:52:44,703
That was terrible,
but you know why he could say he was 

3678
02:52:45,731 --> 02:52:47,140
drunk.
He apologized.

3679
02:52:47,140 --> 02:52:49,330
They have a great relationship now.
People forgive you.

3680
02:52:49,331 --> 02:52:50,164
You don't have to be perfect.
I think if we look for a person who's 

3681
02:52:52,301 --> 02:52:53,134
perfect to be president,
we're not going to have a president 

3682
02:52:55,181 --> 02:52:58,090
because there are no perfect people,
but everybody's been lying,

3683
02:52:58,210 --> 02:52:59,043
so we have to readjust our curve.
Our curves all fucked up because we've 

3684
02:53:01,751 --> 02:53:03,220
been dealing with a bunch of 
politicians,

3685
02:53:03,221 --> 02:53:04,054
had been pretending to be someone who 
whether or not they've been lying about 

3686
02:53:05,441 --> 02:53:06,274
everything they do,
they've been lying about who's paying 

3687
02:53:07,751 --> 02:53:09,520
them to do this and who they're 
supporting,

3688
02:53:09,521 --> 02:53:11,650
where the money's coming from and why 
they do it,

3689
02:53:11,651 --> 02:53:12,484
and there's unspoken arrangements that 
they have with certain people that pam 

3690
02:53:15,730 --> 02:53:18,400
large sums of money.
They don't even have to say,

3691
02:53:18,401 --> 02:53:19,234
I want you to do this.
It's understood that you're going to do 

3692
02:53:21,671 --> 02:53:24,700
things to support their interest because
they've paid a shitload of money to help

3693
02:53:24,701 --> 02:53:25,534
you out and to pay you to come do these 
fucking speeches of these ridiculous 

3694
02:53:28,811 --> 02:53:29,080
play.

3695
02:53:29,080 --> 02:53:29,913
Nobody wants us.
Nobody wants to see a fucking bill 

3696
02:53:31,631 --> 02:53:33,550
clinton speech.
Who's paying?

3697
02:53:33,760 --> 02:53:35,710
Who's paying for that?
Who's,

3698
02:53:35,750 --> 02:53:36,583
who's excited about that?
Who's going to pay enough money to 

3699
02:53:38,831 --> 02:53:41,950
justify a $250,000
hillary clinton's speech?

3700
02:53:42,100 --> 02:53:44,110
Who's paying that?
Who's paying that?

3701
02:53:44,400 --> 02:53:46,210
A crazy person.
You have to be like,

3702
02:53:46,211 --> 02:53:48,640
dude,
this is going to be the shit we have.

3703
02:53:48,730 --> 02:53:51,610
We have tickets to kiss.
We're going to see kiss.

3704
02:53:51,680 --> 02:53:52,513
They have a reunion tour.
I know it's not the real ace freely and 

3705
02:53:54,521 --> 02:53:57,370
it's not the real peter chris,
but the fucking show is awesome,

3706
02:53:57,371 --> 02:53:58,204
dude.
It's amazing and then right after that 

3707
02:54:00,881 --> 02:54:04,840
to top it off,
hillary clinton is going to speak.

3708
02:54:06,490 --> 02:54:07,323
Now.
That's not something she can be a very 

3709
02:54:08,651 --> 02:54:09,484
effective politician,
but to pay someone that much money to 

3710
02:54:12,941 --> 02:54:16,720
speak like you just make it an obvious 
you're not.

3711
02:54:16,780 --> 02:54:19,810
That's not what a normal super famous 
person gets.

3712
02:54:19,900 --> 02:54:22,900
They don't get $250,000
to speak at a luncheon.

3713
02:54:23,050 --> 02:54:27,760
Some comedians not that much clothes,
but you sell out madison square garden.

3714
02:54:28,150 --> 02:54:30,100
You know there's a difference.
Like that's ticket sales.

3715
02:54:30,101 --> 02:54:32,260
Like if bill burst sells out madison 
square garden,

3716
02:54:32,650 --> 02:54:34,150
he's going to get a giant chunk of 
money.

3717
02:54:34,151 --> 02:54:34,984
I don't know what that number is,
but it's probably a giant chunk of 

3718
02:54:36,341 --> 02:54:37,174
money.
Right?

3719
02:54:37,700 --> 02:54:40,540
I'm sure we could ask dane cook.
Dane cook sold out madison square garden

3720
02:54:40,541 --> 02:54:42,280
four times.
okay.

3721
02:54:42,430 --> 02:54:44,830
That's a giant chunk of money he must 
have made,

3722
02:54:44,950 --> 02:54:48,160
but he made it because people paid money
to see them,

3723
02:54:48,460 --> 02:54:51,610
like they want to see him entertain them
or the bankers really doing that.

3724
02:54:51,790 --> 02:54:52,623
Are they fucking psyched?
they have lighters up while she's 

3725
02:54:54,551 --> 02:54:57,460
talking like,
fuck you talking about deregulation.

3726
02:54:58,750 --> 02:54:59,360
Fuck

3727
02:54:59,360 --> 02:55:00,360
yeah,
hillary,

3728
02:55:00,630 --> 02:55:01,463
she's up there with a bite suit on like 
a german shepherd is to jump out of the 

3729
02:55:03,651 --> 02:55:04,484
back of a paddy wagon and bite her legs 
and try to take her down wearing that 

3730
02:55:07,770 --> 02:55:12,770
boxy bite suit the fuck out of here.
It's the whole thing is ridiculous,

3731
02:55:14,340 --> 02:55:16,230
so it's so obvious.

3732
02:55:17,840 --> 02:55:18,673
These people are just.
They're just running this thing the way 

3733
02:55:21,081 --> 02:55:23,480
they've always been running this thing.
We're just getting to see it.

3734
02:55:23,481 --> 02:55:25,970
Now we're getting to see it like really 
super clear.

3735
02:55:26,900 --> 02:55:27,733
We're a real weird,
real weird to watch them scramble and 

3736
02:55:30,411 --> 02:55:31,244
readjust and change and shift and move,
but if you want to be successful in the 

3737
02:55:36,081 --> 02:55:41,070
world that those people run in,
you got to be one of those people like.

3738
02:55:41,090 --> 02:55:45,050
That's why bernie sanders is shunned 
because bernie sanders,

3739
02:55:45,051 --> 02:55:47,990
whether you agree with his politics or 
you disagree with his politics,

3740
02:55:48,180 --> 02:55:52,580
and I agree with a lot of things,
he says he's an outsider.

3741
02:55:52,700 --> 02:55:56,330
They don't want that guy.
that guy's not going to play ball.

3742
02:55:56,360 --> 02:56:00,470
That guy's going to talk to people,
he's going to be reasonable.

3743
02:56:00,710 --> 02:56:02,220
He might be,
you know,

3744
02:56:02,560 --> 02:56:05,720
anti capitalist to a certain extent to 
some people,

3745
02:56:06,290 --> 02:56:11,290
but ultimately what he does represent is
some thing that's different than the way

3746
02:56:12,261 --> 02:56:16,130
things are running now and that they're 
not having that fuck that.

3747
02:56:16,520 --> 02:56:19,640
But he got closer than anybody like him 
has ever gotten ever.

3748
02:56:20,210 --> 02:56:24,500
So I think if four more years of chaos,
whoever the fuck gets in qa,

3749
02:56:24,770 --> 02:56:26,510
you might want to go to Canada for a 
little bit,

3750
02:56:27,350 --> 02:56:30,800
just hang out,
just go to vancouver and yeah,

3751
02:56:31,340 --> 02:56:33,140
who knows what the fuck's going to 
happen man.

3752
02:56:33,200 --> 02:56:34,033
I mean people are up in arms.
I've been watching exclusively fox news 

3753
02:56:39,620 --> 02:56:42,140
because those are the people that think 
the least liked me.

3754
02:56:42,320 --> 02:56:43,153
So I've been exclusively watching and 
occasionally I agree with them on many 

3755
02:56:45,771 --> 02:56:46,604
things,
but those are the people that I agree 

3756
02:56:48,741 --> 02:56:52,040
with the lease.
So it is fascinating watching them.

3757
02:56:52,041 --> 02:56:53,900
First of all,
the trump debate.

3758
02:56:54,200 --> 02:56:55,520
I thought he's too.
I thought he's.

3759
02:56:55,580 --> 02:56:56,413
Oh,
and two,

3760
02:56:56,720 --> 02:56:59,930
I thought hillary whooped him in the 
first one and I thought she.

3761
02:56:59,960 --> 02:57:00,793
She clearly outboxed him and out moved 
him in the second one he did land a 

3762
02:57:04,761 --> 02:57:08,730
devastating blow that you'd be in jail 
because you'd be in jail.

3763
02:57:08,730 --> 02:57:11,270
I was devastating.
That was like a total two point round.

3764
02:57:11,750 --> 02:57:13,250
It was a 10,
eight round for sure.

3765
02:57:13,280 --> 02:57:14,870
He dropped her.
She got rocked.

3766
02:57:15,140 --> 02:57:17,990
Referee saved her.
She saved by the bell there,

3767
02:57:18,500 --> 02:57:22,400
but other than that I think she won.
I think she's just,

3768
02:57:22,520 --> 02:57:26,200
she's just better at that.
She's got better economy of words unlike

3769
02:57:26,210 --> 02:57:28,640
me rambling.
She's got.

3770
02:57:28,730 --> 02:57:33,730
She says her sentences more concisely.
She's more measured in her approach.

3771
02:57:34,220 --> 02:57:35,053
She's more disciplined in her 
preparation to say that she didn't win 

3772
02:57:37,731 --> 02:57:38,840
is.
It's not fair.

3773
02:57:39,140 --> 02:57:40,590
It's not true.
Like if you're.

3774
02:57:40,670 --> 02:57:41,503
So I'm watching these people just lie.
Well obviously Donald Trump was the 

3775
02:57:45,501 --> 02:57:47,750
winner of that debate.
I think there can be no doubt.

3776
02:57:47,760 --> 02:57:48,670
There could be no doubt.
Like,

3777
02:57:48,690 --> 02:57:50,120
oh,
are you really serious?

3778
02:57:50,510 --> 02:57:51,890
Is that what you guys are arguing?

3779
02:57:52,750 --> 02:57:54,960
It blows my fucking mind though.
Like like,

3780
02:57:55,060 --> 02:57:59,080
how are you watching the same thing as 
me and every person that was in the room

3781
02:57:59,081 --> 02:58:00,160
with me agreed with me.
You know,

3782
02:58:00,161 --> 02:58:01,890
like how like if you were in the room,

3783
02:58:02,070 --> 02:58:04,650
would we be both sitting there like 
fighting?

3784
02:58:04,670 --> 02:58:05,503
There's,
there's terms that he uses that you 

3785
02:58:07,591 --> 02:58:08,424
should only use very,
very sparingly because they indicate 

3786
02:58:14,071 --> 02:58:17,020
that you're scrambling and one of those 
is a,

3787
02:58:17,280 --> 02:58:19,440
and I'm going to be honest with you and 
I'll be honest with you.

3788
02:58:20,400 --> 02:58:21,233
This is A shame.
I find this to be a shame like that to 

3789
02:58:23,311 --> 02:58:24,450
me,
says he's,

3790
02:58:24,540 --> 02:58:26,580
he's in the moment.
He's in the moment,

3791
02:58:26,790 --> 02:58:29,100
but he's free ball and a little bit he's
free balling.

3792
02:58:29,580 --> 02:58:30,413
She's not doing that.
She's saying the America that we see in 

3793
02:58:33,541 --> 02:58:34,374
front of us is not perfect,
but it is the best that we can find in 

3794
02:58:37,801 --> 02:58:38,634
the world today and I'm proud to be an 
american and she says this stuff with 

3795
02:58:41,911 --> 02:58:44,450
the right inflection and whether or not 
that's.

3796
02:58:44,550 --> 02:58:45,383
I know it.
Google news crew can choose going to 

3797
02:58:47,530 --> 02:58:49,290
ruin this country.
I understand that,

3798
02:58:49,500 --> 02:58:50,670
but that's not what the debate is.

3799
02:58:50,730 --> 02:58:53,460
Okay.
Would a debate is some sort of a contest

3800
02:58:53,461 --> 02:58:57,060
of words or it's a battle of words.
It's a battle of ideas.

3801
02:58:57,061 --> 02:58:59,670
It's battle concepts about of words and 
personalities.

3802
02:58:59,671 --> 02:59:02,280
Importantly,
he did everything wrong in that respect,

3803
02:59:02,490 --> 02:59:04,560
looming over her and it wasn't 
effective.

3804
02:59:05,040 --> 02:59:06,300
You know,
she,

3805
02:59:06,360 --> 02:59:08,250
she didn't take the bait.
She didn't engage.

3806
02:59:08,251 --> 02:59:10,710
She laughed and smiled when he said 
ridiculous shit.

3807
02:59:10,920 --> 02:59:11,753
Even when he said you'd be in jail,
she walked off and jusT stood there as 

3808
02:59:14,881 --> 02:59:16,500
if nothing happened.
Like she had.

3809
02:59:17,100 --> 02:59:17,933
She had a great reaction to him.
So it's not whether or not she'd be a 

3810
02:59:21,151 --> 02:59:23,940
better president,
but if you want to judge a debate like a

3811
02:59:24,120 --> 02:59:27,290
game of tic tac toe or checkers or you 
know,

3812
02:59:27,390 --> 02:59:28,223
or,
or some sort of a thing that you're 

3813
02:59:30,391 --> 02:59:32,910
sCoring your scoring this thing.
I mean the people,

3814
02:59:32,940 --> 02:59:35,700
it's like a team.
You watch it on online.

3815
02:59:35,700 --> 02:59:36,533
Sixty seven percent think mr.
Secretary of state clinton won the 

3816
02:59:40,291 --> 02:59:41,124
debate.
Now the trump supporters feel 

3817
02:59:42,361 --> 02:59:44,310
differently and then you go to these 
people and they're like,

3818
02:59:44,311 --> 02:59:45,660
well,
I felt he was strong.

3819
02:59:45,810 --> 02:59:48,120
I felt like what he said and that one 
thing,

3820
02:59:48,450 --> 02:59:50,560
you go to jail that really rang with 
moo,

3821
02:59:50,820 --> 02:59:51,660
moo,
moo,

3822
02:59:51,661 --> 02:59:52,494
and see all these people that they've 
chosen that it kind of interesting or 

3823
02:59:55,711 --> 02:59:56,544
controversial or stupid or that one guy 
with the crazy sweater they had that 

3824
02:59:59,911 --> 03:00:02,940
poor bastard,
they have some poor bastard with a giant

3825
03:00:02,941 --> 03:00:03,774
red sweater and he stood out there and 
he saId his name and so his name became 

3826
03:00:07,531 --> 03:00:09,570
like a meme.
that sweater became a meme.

3827
03:00:09,571 --> 03:00:12,240
That sweater sold out everywhere.
All over the world.

3828
03:00:12,241 --> 03:00:13,074
Like instantly.
People are going to be that guy for 

3829
03:00:14,581 --> 03:00:16,360
halloween now.
Yeah,

3830
03:00:16,380 --> 03:00:18,180
he's everywhere.
He's everywhere.

3831
03:00:18,540 --> 03:00:19,680
Shirts.
Good for him,

3832
03:00:19,770 --> 03:00:20,900
good for him,
but he's cool.

3833
03:00:21,420 --> 03:00:23,460
But that's.
It's a fucking.

3834
03:00:23,710 --> 03:00:25,980
It's a game and it's an entertaining 
show.

3835
03:00:26,220 --> 03:00:27,053
That's what these debates are and it's a
giant hustle and this is what I'm 

3836
03:00:29,791 --> 03:00:30,624
sending out saying this a conspiracy 
theory sort of a way because I think 

3837
03:00:32,311 --> 03:00:34,620
we're hustling ourself.
We want this hustle.

3838
03:00:34,920 --> 03:00:36,120
This is a hustle.
We all want to say,

3839
03:00:36,121 --> 03:00:36,954
we all want to pretend that he's going 
to fix it or we don't want to pretend 

3840
03:00:38,671 --> 03:00:42,140
that she's going to be amazing.
We all want to pretend it's a.

3841
03:00:42,180 --> 03:00:44,850
It's a weird,
weird show.

3842
03:00:45,370 --> 03:00:48,870
It's a weird show and we're watching 
these people improvise right in front of

3843
03:00:48,871 --> 03:00:51,080
us.
Alex Jones,

3844
03:00:51,150 --> 03:00:54,390
response to it was very upsetting to me.
It was wonderful.

3845
03:00:54,450 --> 03:00:55,830
Alex johnson,
literally,

3846
03:00:55,890 --> 03:00:57,690
literally,
she's a demon from hell.

3847
03:00:57,990 --> 03:01:00,850
Literally.
We've flies land on her head.

3848
03:01:01,870 --> 03:01:03,720
Ladies and gentlemen,
we seen flies,

3849
03:01:04,170 --> 03:01:06,090
talked to people who are on the scene.

3850
03:01:06,860 --> 03:01:10,390
He's fucking beat red sky purple,
red face.

3851
03:01:10,420 --> 03:01:13,540
thursday evens demons are real.
he was crying.

3852
03:01:14,070 --> 03:01:15,340
It's wonderful.
I love that guy.

3853
03:01:15,341 --> 03:01:16,960
He's the best.
I agree with that.

3854
03:01:17,010 --> 03:01:19,990
That was upset and he's taken it to the 
right place.

3855
03:01:20,020 --> 03:01:22,510
I think he's just gone full parody.
Just go.

3856
03:01:22,630 --> 03:01:24,970
Just get so crazy.
I think it's perfect.

3857
03:01:25,000 --> 03:01:26,440
That's perfect.
Yeah.

3858
03:01:26,441 --> 03:01:30,430
Just give people just a little more than
they can swallow.

3859
03:01:30,460 --> 03:01:31,293
I'm choking back.
The irony and the crazy is making even 

3860
03:01:35,081 --> 03:01:38,050
like the serious conspiracy theories 
reconsider their position,

3861
03:01:38,470 --> 03:01:39,303
which I think is good.
Which is also the best argument that he 

3862
03:01:41,971 --> 03:01:42,804
psyops that he's actually cia,
nsa undercover to discredit the entire 

3863
03:01:48,341 --> 03:01:51,360
truth or movement.
Don't you understand?

3864
03:01:52,210 --> 03:01:55,020
I went down to rabbit holes last night 
to tower seven rabbit hole.

3865
03:01:55,021 --> 03:01:58,690
So I went down the explanation tower 
seven rabbit hole,

3866
03:01:58,691 --> 03:01:59,524
which I found to be very plausible.
And then I went down the other rabbit 

3867
03:02:04,121 --> 03:02:07,960
hole,
which is actual scientists that are uh,

3868
03:02:08,080 --> 03:02:11,140
saying that nine slash 11 was absolutely
a controlled demolition.

3869
03:02:11,470 --> 03:02:13,810
And it's really weird man because one of
them,

3870
03:02:13,811 --> 03:02:15,550
the scientist guys who's given this 
lecture,

3871
03:02:15,551 --> 03:02:16,384
I forget the gentleman's name,
but he's a professor emeritus of some 

3872
03:02:18,521 --> 03:02:23,080
university which means a,
he was a professor and then he retired,

3873
03:02:23,081 --> 03:02:25,450
but they allow him to keep his title and
keep his office.

3874
03:02:26,260 --> 03:02:28,080
And this dude is off his rocker.
He's.

3875
03:02:28,130 --> 03:02:32,050
He does.
He's to our speeches about tower seven,

3876
03:02:32,920 --> 03:02:33,753
you know,
about free fall speed and thermite and 

3877
03:02:36,251 --> 03:02:39,610
all these different chemicals that were 
found in the wreckage.

3878
03:02:39,611 --> 03:02:43,870
And he's just obsessed with this idea.
And apparently he's not the only one.

3879
03:02:43,900 --> 03:02:46,820
There's thousands of different,
at least a thousand.

3880
03:02:46,900 --> 03:02:47,733
I think it was like 1500 or something,
architects and engineers in that nine 

3881
03:02:50,831 --> 03:02:55,750
slash 11 truth thing that think that 
nine slash 11 was an inside job or tower

3882
03:02:55,751 --> 03:02:58,000
seven was a controlled demolition or 
both.

3883
03:02:58,001 --> 03:02:58,834
You know,
there's a spectrum of belief systems 

3884
03:03:00,550 --> 03:03:02,650
that's involved in the nine slash 11 
truther movement.

3885
03:03:03,040 --> 03:03:03,873
You know,
some people think that there's a lot of 

3886
03:03:05,801 --> 03:03:08,680
nuts to think that planes didn't even 
really hit the towers,

3887
03:03:08,681 --> 03:03:12,520
that there were explosions and then 
there's other people that think that the

3888
03:03:12,521 --> 03:03:13,354
towers were rigged and that they rigged 
these things like years in advance and 

3889
03:03:17,321 --> 03:03:18,154
they remember seeing these maintenance 
people and they were like these 

3890
03:03:20,110 --> 03:03:20,943
nefarious maintenance people are setting
up through my bombs all throughout the 

3891
03:03:23,681 --> 03:03:24,514
beams of the.
But then there's this other video that 

3892
03:03:26,411 --> 03:03:27,244
shows how how easily things weakened.
A under fire shows a bunch of shit 

3893
03:03:31,991 --> 03:03:34,060
collapsing under fire,
including a bridge.

3894
03:03:34,330 --> 03:03:35,163
There was one where a bridge collapsed 
just because of a fire underneath the 

3895
03:03:37,031 --> 03:03:37,864
bridge.
The steel and the bridge heated up too 

3896
03:03:39,011 --> 03:03:43,480
much and just couldn't support the 
weight and apparently what is explaining

3897
03:03:43,481 --> 03:03:46,930
is that people think that steel melts at
a certain temperature,

3898
03:03:46,931 --> 03:03:51,250
which is very true,
but it's significantly weakens way lower

3899
03:03:51,310 --> 03:03:53,230
at a way lower temperature.
Then it melts.

3900
03:03:53,380 --> 03:03:55,950
So they were showing all these different
things that,

3901
03:03:55,990 --> 03:03:58,100
that collapsed just fall

3902
03:03:58,100 --> 03:04:01,490
down to just give up just like that 
tower seven did.

3903
03:04:02,060 --> 03:04:02,893
But it's fun to think that there is an 
evil genius that lives in a mountain 

3904
03:04:07,400 --> 03:04:10,040
that rigged all that shit.
And now he's laughing in a pile of money

3905
03:04:11,090 --> 03:04:12,620
because he got away with it 15 years 
ago,

3906
03:04:13,820 --> 03:04:16,130
you know,
they opened a walmart in burbank,

3907
03:04:16,340 --> 03:04:17,320
thank god.
And,

3908
03:04:17,380 --> 03:04:22,380
and I was excited and I decided,
I decided I hate mom and pop businesses.

3909
03:04:23,820 --> 03:04:26,110
It just because it's not.
See people working for the sheep,

3910
03:04:26,340 --> 03:04:27,350
you know,
it's just nice.

3911
03:04:27,690 --> 03:04:28,523
Uh,
but you go there thinking it's in 

3912
03:04:30,411 --> 03:04:31,244
burbank,
one of the suburban nicer areas of los 

3913
03:04:32,931 --> 03:04:33,800
angeles.
No way.

3914
03:04:33,801 --> 03:04:37,070
It's going to be the same people that go
to a walmart in burbank.

3915
03:04:37,071 --> 03:04:37,731
Then you're,
you know,

3916
03:04:37,731 --> 03:04:40,880
you see on the internet or no,
whatever it is,

3917
03:04:40,881 --> 03:04:43,160
it's like a,
like flies on poop.

3918
03:04:43,390 --> 03:04:43,980
Uh,
it,

3919
03:04:43,980 --> 03:04:45,740
it was just filled with like tits 
hanging out.

3920
03:04:45,741 --> 03:04:49,040
This woman's Bruises all over like kids 
with no shoes on.

3921
03:04:49,041 --> 03:04:51,740
Like it was just like,
where are all these people from?

3922
03:04:51,830 --> 03:04:54,450
They find it,
they find it and I,

3923
03:04:54,460 --> 03:04:55,011
you know,
the,

3924
03:04:55,011 --> 03:04:58,020
the conspiracies and all that crap.
To me it just,

3925
03:04:58,030 --> 03:05:00,380
it's like that half the people on my 
facebook,

3926
03:05:00,381 --> 03:05:01,400
I just look at him like,
dude,

3927
03:05:01,401 --> 03:05:02,234
I,
I should leave.

3928
03:05:02,680 --> 03:05:03,513
We need to get chinese assassins of old 
people to come over here and make 

3929
03:05:07,830 --> 03:05:12,730
walmart big fly trap.
Walmart's and he just say,

3930
03:05:12,760 --> 03:05:13,593
hey,
you tired of white people being pushed 

3931
03:05:14,861 --> 03:05:19,861
down and we'll come on in this room were
organized and know,

3932
03:05:20,140 --> 03:05:20,973
like having a bunch of different like 
social honey traps where people just 

3933
03:05:25,060 --> 03:05:26,590
fall into a pillow up

3934
03:05:26,650 --> 03:05:29,660
all the walmart's on black friday and 
then trump loses.

3935
03:05:30,000 --> 03:05:30,833
Could you imagine if we got to a point 
wHere we had to start killing people 

3936
03:05:33,751 --> 03:05:34,584
off?
Like there's just way too many people 

3937
03:05:35,611 --> 03:05:37,290
and there's no other way around.
In China.

3938
03:05:37,320 --> 03:05:38,153
We got a call people the same way they 
want to call wolves and the greater 

3939
03:05:41,341 --> 03:05:44,940
yellowstone ecosystem.
What the fuck,

3940
03:05:44,941 --> 03:05:46,320
man?
Is that possible?

3941
03:05:46,380 --> 03:05:47,270
Is it possible?
I mean,

3942
03:05:47,460 --> 03:05:49,290
we're keep overpopulating,
right?

3943
03:05:49,530 --> 03:05:51,540
We're at 7 billion.
They project,

3944
03:05:51,630 --> 03:05:55,320
I think they project 8 billion by 2050.
I think that's what they said.

3945
03:05:55,800 --> 03:05:56,633
See if that's true.
Jamie.

3946
03:05:57,010 --> 03:06:00,400
There's a lot of middle states though.
We got a lot of room.

3947
03:06:00,401 --> 03:06:00,930
We just got it.

3948
03:06:00,930 --> 03:06:02,820
You don't have the water right that we 
talked about this,

3949
03:06:02,821 --> 03:06:04,950
the desalinization.
It can't fill up those areas,

3950
03:06:05,220 --> 03:06:08,880
but don't you think that there's gonna 
come a time if we survive,

3951
03:06:08,881 --> 03:06:10,800
right?
Say if there's no super volcanoes,

3952
03:06:10,801 --> 03:06:12,800
no asteroid impacts,
no plague,

3953
03:06:12,801 --> 03:06:15,270
no nuclear war,
and we avoid all that shit.

3954
03:06:16,020 --> 03:06:18,150
You know the water is going to ride.
We're going to move in.

3955
03:06:18,151 --> 03:06:18,984
We'll be fine.
The coast to just be in a different 

3956
03:06:19,831 --> 03:06:22,140
spot.
It's not that big of a deal.

3957
03:06:22,470 --> 03:06:24,060
I mean it's a big deal obviously,
but it's not the,

3958
03:06:24,061 --> 03:06:26,970
it's not a kill off the population.
Big a deal.

3959
03:06:27,330 --> 03:06:30,870
So if it keeps going and we keep.
the technology keeps getting better,

3960
03:06:31,090 --> 03:06:33,450
we Just keep.
Keep making people,

3961
03:06:33,660 --> 03:06:34,493
we just keep doing it.
We keep the numbers keep rising and 

3962
03:06:36,591 --> 03:06:39,060
rising and rising and then we get to be 
like $30 million,

3963
03:06:39,330 --> 03:06:40,260
$40,
million,

3964
03:06:40,470 --> 03:06:44,310
$50 million and we have real problems 
where we don't have enough food,

3965
03:06:44,340 --> 03:06:46,890
we don't have enough air,
we don't have enough space.

3966
03:06:47,760 --> 03:06:48,593
What are we going to do?

3967
03:06:51,030 --> 03:06:52,500
Make food.
That's already a thing.

3968
03:06:52,950 --> 03:06:54,270
What about gil?
Stupid people.

3969
03:06:54,720 --> 03:06:55,670
Stupid.
Sure.

3970
03:06:55,740 --> 03:06:55,980
No,
you

3971
03:06:55,980 --> 03:06:57,510
can't say that because that's what 
hitler wanted.

3972
03:06:58,280 --> 03:06:59,113
He had.
He had some good ideas and some bad 

3973
03:07:00,151 --> 03:07:02,430
ideas.
No,

3974
03:07:02,460 --> 03:07:03,293
I mean there's definitely like the look 
this chinese thing that makes complete 

3975
03:07:07,351 --> 03:07:09,600
sense if they're killing off.
Do you think they're doing that though?

3976
03:07:09,630 --> 03:07:11,250
Yes.
There's too many people in China.

3977
03:07:11,280 --> 03:07:12,113
They cannot have that many people.
So if they get rid of a certain age of 

3978
03:07:17,371 --> 03:07:18,204
people,
especially if they have mental issues 

3979
03:07:20,160 --> 03:07:21,590
like homeless people,
you know,

3980
03:07:21,600 --> 03:07:25,790
but we already figured out that the 
United States has almost 100,000.

3981
03:07:25,800 --> 03:07:27,600
Right.
Was it [inaudible] 90 something thousand

3982
03:07:27,750 --> 03:07:30,930
at any given yet said about $90,000
any given year.

3983
03:07:31,070 --> 03:07:32,820
Any given day.
Any given 10,000

3984
03:07:32,850 --> 03:07:34,140
missing.
Oh,

3985
03:07:34,400 --> 03:07:36,270
excellent.
So overall I see,

3986
03:07:36,271 --> 03:07:39,390
I see,
and this is elderly people.

3987
03:07:39,420 --> 03:07:41,790
Oh this is including kids.
Well that's way different.

3988
03:07:41,791 --> 03:07:44,530
Are they talking about 500,000
elderly or $500,000?

3989
03:07:44,570 --> 03:07:45,870
100,000
elderly.

3990
03:07:45,950 --> 03:07:47,950
Ooh.
Oh yeah.

3991
03:07:48,020 --> 03:07:49,170
They're killing them for sure.

3992
03:07:49,440 --> 03:07:50,130
Right,
right.

3993
03:07:50,130 --> 03:07:53,250
For sure.
That's why they killed kids or they used

3994
03:07:53,251 --> 03:07:54,240
to,
but they,

3995
03:07:54,250 --> 03:07:56,040
you know,
if you will.

3996
03:07:56,060 --> 03:07:57,570
That's kind of what I'm saying.
Right.

3997
03:07:58,470 --> 03:08:00,720
About populations.
If they get too high,

3998
03:08:00,850 --> 03:08:03,780
see people aren't valuable anymore.
500,000

3999
03:08:03,810 --> 03:08:06,060
elderly people go missing in China every
year,

4000
03:08:06,100 --> 03:08:06,933
which is 80 percent.
Eighty percent of the missing people 

4001
03:08:09,361 --> 03:08:12,560
are,
I believe to 80 percent of people.

4002
03:08:12,890 --> 03:08:13,723
Do you think that's real?
Do you think they're killing people or 

4003
03:08:15,061 --> 03:08:16,620
do you think people just get lost really
easy.

4004
03:08:17,220 --> 03:08:18,053
A look at it,
it's eigHty percent of 80 percent are 

4005
03:08:20,911 --> 03:08:21,840
elderly,
so yes,

4006
03:08:21,841 --> 03:08:26,100
I believe that they're killing them or 
there's 72 percent suffered some sort of

4007
03:08:26,101 --> 03:08:27,720
memory impairment.
Yeah.

4008
03:08:27,750 --> 03:08:28,583
But it might be a mental health issue,
but they might just not treat their 

4009
03:08:31,891 --> 03:08:34,470
mentally ill.
But look at the numbers in that chart.

4010
03:08:34,471 --> 03:08:35,580
Jamie.
Scroll back up there,

4011
03:08:35,581 --> 03:08:36,414
look at that shit.
Look at the difference between what is 

4012
03:08:38,161 --> 03:08:43,161
the earliest part of the chart in 1965 
population of people over 65.

4013
03:08:43,620 --> 03:08:46,950
Yeah,
but 1965 page thing.

4014
03:08:46,951 --> 03:08:49,990
Jamie the bottom 19.
Sixty five to 2015.

4015
03:08:50,460 --> 03:08:53,670
If you look at the way he runs up to 
2015,

4016
03:08:53,671 --> 03:08:54,504
that's a spike man or at least a steep 
ramp and then they're saying that kill 

4017
03:08:59,500 --> 03:09:03,240
an old now and they're saying that out 
of those groups that are missing,

4018
03:09:03,330 --> 03:09:04,163
a large amount of them have been 
diagnosed already with like an illness 

4019
03:09:07,240 --> 03:09:08,073
like alzheimer's or something like that.
So they're already on the way out there 

4020
03:09:09,661 --> 03:09:11,510
saying so.
So they just.

4021
03:09:11,690 --> 03:09:13,550
They isom they get rid of soy.
Yeah,

4022
03:09:13,560 --> 03:09:17,190
because it's costing them more money and
population.

4023
03:09:17,191 --> 03:09:18,024
It's.
It's taken up space to to imagine if we 

4024
03:09:19,621 --> 03:09:23,910
find out that there is a murder racket 
in China that kills 500,000

4025
03:09:23,940 --> 03:09:27,270
old sick people a year.
Imagine.

4026
03:09:27,271 --> 03:09:28,104
I mean,
right now we're just looking at a 

4027
03:09:28,651 --> 03:09:29,484
number,
but if we found out that is absolutely 

4028
03:09:32,341 --> 03:09:35,820
what was going on,
I think by 20,

4029
03:09:35,821 --> 03:09:36,654
30 they're going to have more than 400 
million people over 60 their g and they 

4030
03:09:43,231 --> 03:09:45,600
last longer.
The asians because they eat so nice.

4031
03:09:47,160 --> 03:09:49,140
That's so racist.
It's so funny.

4032
03:09:49,200 --> 03:09:51,930
As a meme,
like a racist,

4033
03:09:51,931 --> 03:09:53,740
mean people are going to beat your ass.

4034
03:09:54,520 --> 03:09:57,160
Isn't that funny?
But you said nothing but a good thing.

4035
03:09:57,161 --> 03:09:58,450
No,
you said good things,

4036
03:09:58,451 --> 03:09:59,284
but it's racial and so when it's racial,
people automatically get recreationally 

4037
03:10:02,770 --> 03:10:03,603
upset,
recreational outrage kicks in and 

4038
03:10:05,831 --> 03:10:06,664
they'll call you a racist for saying 
that asian people last longer because 

4039
03:10:09,371 --> 03:10:11,510
they eat well.
But you just said eat night.

4040
03:10:11,880 --> 03:10:14,010
Nice.
That was a better way to say it.

4041
03:10:14,460 --> 03:10:15,190
The,
uh,

4042
03:10:15,190 --> 03:10:16,140
the,
my,

4043
03:10:16,460 --> 03:10:17,293
my girlfriend's agent and she's the most
racist of chinese people have all the 

4044
03:10:20,131 --> 03:10:24,340
time and most asians hate chinese people
and you're like,

4045
03:10:24,341 --> 03:10:26,470
why are you racist against chinese 
people?

4046
03:10:26,700 --> 03:10:27,131
She's like,
oh,

4047
03:10:27,131 --> 03:10:30,490
they're stupid dude.
Then you research it and you're like,

4048
03:10:30,491 --> 03:10:31,324
maybe you should let her say to my ex 
girlfriend the one that died in the 

4049
03:10:35,260 --> 03:10:36,970
crash,
but uh,

4050
03:10:37,420 --> 03:10:38,253
but,
but then you read all these things like 

4051
03:10:39,181 --> 03:10:40,780
that.
I like about this and you're like,

4052
03:10:40,781 --> 03:10:42,880
holy shit.
what's going on in China?

4053
03:10:43,720 --> 03:10:45,160
It's fucked up over there,
man.

4054
03:10:46,090 --> 03:10:47,910
Tell you what's going on.
Or he's been there.

4055
03:10:48,570 --> 03:10:50,670
I know of quite a few people that have 
been in China.

4056
03:10:50,760 --> 03:10:51,600
Somebody just.
Oh,

4057
03:10:51,601 --> 03:10:53,230
tate tate's in China right now?
Yeah,

4058
03:10:53,580 --> 03:10:55,320
he's doing some crossfit shit over 
there.

4059
03:10:55,770 --> 03:10:57,900
He's doing some stuff with the guy who 
owns crossfit.

4060
03:10:58,440 --> 03:11:00,160
Yeah.
Is a trip man.

4061
03:11:00,840 --> 03:11:01,673
Apparently though there's something like
50 new billionaires are created every 

4062
03:11:05,700 --> 03:11:08,160
day in China.
Something insane like that.

4063
03:11:08,720 --> 03:11:13,440
Tate told me I should probably know 
these things before I say them out loud,

4064
03:11:13,441 --> 03:11:15,150
but you know,
it is folks.

4065
03:11:16,110 --> 03:11:19,230
How many new billionaires are Created 
every day in China?

4066
03:11:19,290 --> 03:11:20,250
What do you say,
brian?

4067
03:11:20,910 --> 03:11:21,743
50 sure was it say business insider says
China gets the new billionaire every 

4068
03:11:28,051 --> 03:11:30,990
five days.
So not five every day.

4069
03:11:30,991 --> 03:11:33,660
It's one every five days.
Well that sounds more likely.

4070
03:11:35,970 --> 03:11:40,970
So that's a 20 a month one every one 
every five days.

4071
03:11:42,060 --> 03:11:42,893
Six month wait a minute.
When every five days or seven days in a 

4072
03:11:47,521 --> 03:11:49,410
week,
there's four weeks in a month.

4073
03:11:49,730 --> 03:11:54,570
Thirty days every month.
So every so six,

4074
03:11:54,960 --> 03:11:58,710
six times 5:30.
So every month they get a billion.

4075
03:11:58,711 --> 03:12:00,330
Except for like february.
It's short months.

4076
03:12:00,331 --> 03:12:02,610
Sixty every year.
Something like how crazy is that?

4077
03:12:02,700 --> 03:12:05,400
So it's 68 year essentially 50,
60 year instead of 50,

4078
03:12:05,401 --> 03:12:09,150
60 a day when I was only off by a factor
of 365.

4079
03:12:09,780 --> 03:12:11,790
Let's see whAt tate said.
Maybe tate lied to me.

4080
03:12:11,910 --> 03:12:16,440
Motherfucker.
It is a strange place though.

4081
03:12:16,441 --> 03:12:17,274
Like when we think about like that 
language can develop in two different 

4082
03:12:21,691 --> 03:12:22,524
places in two completely different ways.
Like if you got your language that we 

4083
03:12:25,201 --> 03:12:26,034
have over here with our very specific 
sounds that sound like english and then 

4084
03:12:29,731 --> 03:12:32,250
they get a little weirder when they go 
to certain places.

4085
03:12:32,460 --> 03:12:34,680
Like if you go to a,
you know,

4086
03:12:34,681 --> 03:12:39,681
like a Germany or like thoSe places that
they have different sounds and they have

4087
03:12:41,101 --> 03:12:45,240
the parts of the world where they have 
like different sort of sounds like that.

4088
03:12:45,950 --> 03:12:46,783
And then you've got China which has got 
its own kind of weird thing and then on 

4089
03:12:50,101 --> 03:12:50,911
top of that,
okay,

4090
03:12:50,911 --> 03:12:52,000
here he says they

4091
03:12:52,000 --> 03:12:52,833
have made a here each year for 400,
$9 millionaires made their each day of 

4092
03:12:59,840 --> 03:13:01,250
the year.
That's more impressive.

4093
03:13:01,350 --> 03:13:02,390
Wow.
That's what it was.

4094
03:13:02,391 --> 03:13:06,940
He said 409 millionaires made their each
day and $50.

4095
03:13:06,941 --> 03:13:09,410
Million people living in shanghai.
Okay.

4096
03:13:09,411 --> 03:13:10,670
That's,
that's the 40.

4097
03:13:10,730 --> 03:13:12,320
That's the 50.
That's where I got confused.

4098
03:13:13,250 --> 03:13:14,870
Fuck man.
But their language,

4099
03:13:14,871 --> 03:13:16,640
like when you look at it written down 
and you're like,

4100
03:13:16,700 --> 03:13:17,960
whoa,
this is alien.

4101
03:13:18,290 --> 03:13:19,123
Alien language.
Like we didn't know that chinese was 

4102
03:13:21,171 --> 03:13:22,070
chinese.
You know,

4103
03:13:22,071 --> 03:13:23,180
you pass by chinatown,
you go,

4104
03:13:23,181 --> 03:13:23,871
oh,
they have a.

4105
03:13:23,871 --> 03:13:25,220
Yeah,
chinese language on the wall.

4106
03:13:25,520 --> 03:13:29,510
If you went into space and you found 
that shit on a rock in a cave somewhere,

4107
03:13:29,630 --> 03:13:30,321
he'd be like,
oh my god,

4108
03:13:30,321 --> 03:13:31,154
it's alien language.
It's so much more sophisticated than 

4109
03:13:32,871 --> 03:13:34,130
ours.
Look at the characters.

4110
03:13:34,131 --> 03:13:35,690
I can't.
I can't be deciphered.

4111
03:13:35,990 --> 03:13:38,090
We will be looking at it like what is 
that?

4112
03:13:38,510 --> 03:13:39,343
These little characters,
sort of strange characters and they all 

4113
03:13:42,471 --> 03:13:43,304
know and they have way more characters 
and we have letters way more because 

4114
03:13:47,331 --> 03:13:50,810
each character is like a word,
like waterfalls.

4115
03:13:51,230 --> 03:13:52,400
Exactly.
Fucked up.

4116
03:13:52,600 --> 03:13:56,420
What was it supposed to be on your arm 
are for chinese are from my last name.

4117
03:13:56,430 --> 03:13:57,263
Written.
There's no such thing as an in chinese 

4118
03:13:58,521 --> 03:14:02,480
and so they thought you said wow,
a waterfall fall.

4119
03:14:04,330 --> 03:14:05,163
Yeah.

4120
03:14:06,100 --> 03:14:08,260
Well it wasn't a asian person that did 
it though.

4121
03:14:08,261 --> 03:14:10,240
Right?
A white girl horse.

4122
03:14:10,330 --> 03:14:11,800
She didn't know.
Eighteen year old was writing.

4123
03:14:12,160 --> 03:14:14,980
That bitch made up some shit on you,
drew on you.

4124
03:14:14,981 --> 03:14:17,620
I made up some shit.
She had a book that actually said like I

4125
03:14:17,621 --> 03:14:18,251
said,
hey.

4126
03:14:18,251 --> 03:14:20,740
And it showed the symbol be,
but it was Just bullshit.

4127
03:14:20,860 --> 03:14:21,693
People that made that book are laughing 
while they pushed it out the door and 

4128
03:14:26,920 --> 03:14:31,920
chinese joke book,
racist,

4129
03:14:32,020 --> 03:14:33,370
racist.
Do a chinese accent,

4130
03:14:33,371 --> 03:14:35,140
but you can do an english accent all 
day.

4131
03:14:35,520 --> 03:14:38,110
It was strange,
but isn't it odd he can go,

4132
03:14:38,140 --> 03:14:40,810
hello and how are you brian reichle and 
no to go.

4133
03:14:40,811 --> 03:14:43,390
You fucking racist.
You're racist piece of shit.

4134
03:14:43,750 --> 03:14:47,030
But if you will,
not the whole malakal

4135
03:14:47,170 --> 03:14:49,000
if you do that,
you're racist.

4136
03:14:49,630 --> 03:14:51,190
Right?
That sounds racist.

4137
03:14:51,191 --> 03:14:53,560
You are mocking the way chinese people 
sound.

4138
03:14:53,561 --> 03:14:54,610
well.
he ever unusual

4139
03:14:54,610 --> 03:14:57,580
sound like I'm on the whole or you hear 
them talk.

4140
03:14:57,581 --> 03:15:00,310
It's like a very weird kind of 
fascinating.

4141
03:15:00,640 --> 03:15:01,860
I think it sounds cool,
but it's,

4142
03:15:01,990 --> 03:15:06,070
it's a strange sound in comparison to 
the english that we're used to.

4143
03:15:06,160 --> 03:15:08,980
Is it racist though?
I mean like I've told you about.

4144
03:15:08,981 --> 03:15:10,780
How old is mr brian?
Well,

4145
03:15:11,060 --> 03:15:11,893
yeah,
but if I just like I told you about 

4146
03:15:14,021 --> 03:15:16,300
this,
my girlfriend who has to speak korean,

4147
03:15:16,330 --> 03:15:19,420
so I try to speak korean,
like I just tried to make the noises,

4148
03:15:19,690 --> 03:15:20,523
not anything racist.
Like I jusT try to make the noises and 

4149
03:15:22,691 --> 03:15:26,020
then like every couple,
like 10 seconds she'll be like,

4150
03:15:26,021 --> 03:15:30,610
you just said grasshopper.
You just said haka and like it's weird.

4151
03:15:30,880 --> 03:15:33,560
And then like make noises,
noises that sound like,

4152
03:15:33,570 --> 03:15:34,520
like,
well if you collect these,

4153
03:15:34,730 --> 03:15:35,563
doing that with her and you'll learn the
language I know is to constantly create 

4154
03:15:40,181 --> 03:15:42,150
a database in your head.
You can do it.

4155
03:15:42,151 --> 03:15:43,810
Dude,
I got faith in you.

4156
03:15:43,870 --> 03:15:45,430
I've learned that.
I've learned a few words.

4157
03:15:46,630 --> 03:15:50,460
I used to teach taekwondo in Korea and 
really stiff count and korean.

4158
03:15:50,750 --> 03:15:51,950
No way.
Do you still know?

4159
03:15:52,330 --> 03:15:53,101
Yeah,
I think so.

4160
03:15:53,101 --> 03:15:54,410
I'll probably fuck it up.
Uh,

4161
03:15:54,411 --> 03:15:59,411
it was like a dual set net dose now 
fucked it up already.

4162
03:16:00,270 --> 03:16:03,090
Those use.
It'll go to dude.

4163
03:16:03,120 --> 03:16:03,953
I'm not saying it very good either 
beCause my instructor had a very strong 

4164
03:16:07,320 --> 03:16:11,370
accent and it was hard sometimes to 
understand exactly how to say the words.

4165
03:16:11,730 --> 03:16:15,410
But like a kicks would be in um,
in,

4166
03:16:15,640 --> 03:16:18,180
in taekwondo kicks would be.
You'd say it in koRean,

4167
03:16:18,480 --> 03:16:22,740
like a up chuggy.
Chuggy was front kick.

4168
03:16:23,340 --> 03:16:27,120
Chuggy is roundhouse kick.
It was like a bunch of different.

4169
03:16:27,150 --> 03:16:30,480
Yeah.
I don't remember all of them though.

4170
03:16:31,560 --> 03:16:33,020
I forgot a lot of them.
Man,

4171
03:16:33,270 --> 03:16:34,200
I forgot a lot of it.

4172
03:16:34,600 --> 03:16:35,433
I learned how to say like,
I guess it means like gay or something 

4173
03:16:37,871 --> 03:16:39,160
like that.
But you say I did,

4174
03:16:39,190 --> 03:16:40,630
but you say it as like,
like,

4175
03:16:40,690 --> 03:16:42,160
like,
like that or something.

4176
03:16:42,310 --> 03:16:43,890
So like japanese?
No,

4177
03:16:43,900 --> 03:16:44,230
no,
no.

4178
03:16:44,230 --> 03:16:44,971
Korean,
korean.

4179
03:16:44,971 --> 03:16:45,271
So,
so.

4180
03:16:45,271 --> 03:16:47,300
Okay.
So I embarrassed my girlfriend,

4181
03:16:47,301 --> 03:16:48,490
like will be in publiC and out have 
nowhere.

4182
03:16:48,491 --> 03:16:49,324
I'd just turned to me like.

4183
03:16:50,400 --> 03:16:51,233
And she's like [inaudible].
I guess it's really embarrassing saying 

4184
03:16:54,660 --> 03:16:55,830
nookie.
Nookie.

4185
03:16:55,860 --> 03:16:56,970
Yeah.
Like,

4186
03:16:57,060 --> 03:16:58,530
oh,
that limp bizkit song.

4187
03:16:58,970 --> 03:17:00,530
Yeah,
I did it all for the nicki.

4188
03:17:00,650 --> 03:17:02,740
Nicki.
so if they went to see limp bizkit,

4189
03:17:02,741 --> 03:17:04,080
they just start laughing.
Oh,

4190
03:17:04,100 --> 03:17:08,870
I cAn't believe I'm saying this.
Is that what happened?

4191
03:17:08,880 --> 03:17:09,713
Yeah,
probably there was a weird time where 

4192
03:17:13,801 --> 03:17:18,750
I'm like,
it's very strange where a word from some

4193
03:17:18,751 --> 03:17:19,584
other language means nothing over here.
Like we say words and it means like 

4194
03:17:24,230 --> 03:17:28,950
something really fucked up over there.
Like just certain words like,

4195
03:17:29,130 --> 03:17:31,050
okay,
here's a perfect example of fanny pack.

4196
03:17:31,560 --> 03:17:35,190
Fanny means vagina and england.
I got that app,

4197
03:17:36,590 --> 03:17:37,423
have fuck that happens.
Simulation theory or facts for 

4198
03:17:40,831 --> 03:17:42,930
cigarettes,
they call cigarette a fag

4199
03:17:43,160 --> 03:17:44,510
or a faggots.

4200
03:17:45,460 --> 03:17:47,350
You know what that is,
man.

4201
03:17:47,620 --> 03:17:48,890
Here's the thing,
there's,

4202
03:17:48,891 --> 03:17:51,460
there's a misconception about that.
The entomology,

4203
03:17:51,461 --> 03:17:52,294
I think that's the word of that word,
the word faggot even was even miss 

4204
03:17:56,900 --> 03:17:57,733
misspoke on the louis ck show that they 
said that it was originally that the 

4205
03:18:02,501 --> 03:18:03,334
reason why they use that term for gay 
people is because it's a bundle of 

4206
03:18:07,511 --> 03:18:10,300
sticks and they would light the bundle 
of sticks on fire,

4207
03:18:10,720 --> 03:18:11,553
and so the reason why they call someone 
a faggot in the reason why it was so 

4208
03:18:13,721 --> 03:18:16,900
offensive is because that means that 
they're to be lit on fire.

4209
03:18:17,290 --> 03:18:19,070
That's not true.
No,

4210
03:18:19,210 --> 03:18:20,043
that's not true,
and it wouldn't have taken long to 

4211
03:18:21,041 --> 03:18:23,260
research this.
The actual origin,

4212
03:18:23,470 --> 03:18:27,430
what it means is it's a bundle of wood,
like a burdensome woman.

4213
03:18:27,910 --> 03:18:28,743
A faggot is very difficult to carry 
because it's like a bundle of wood and 

4214
03:18:33,281 --> 03:18:34,061
you're,
you're.

4215
03:18:34,061 --> 03:18:36,460
It's very difficult to balance a budget.
It's cumbersome.

4216
03:18:36,940 --> 03:18:41,940
So a burdensome woman became a faggot.
So a guy who act like a woman,

4217
03:18:43,120 --> 03:18:43,953
like a burdensome woman became a faggot.
It had nothing to do with lighting on 

4218
03:18:47,621 --> 03:18:48,100
fire,

4219
03:18:48,100 --> 03:18:51,580
and there's no evidence other than 
isolated hate crimes,

4220
03:18:51,640 --> 03:18:52,473
crimes.
There is no evidence of a practice of 

4221
03:18:54,671 --> 03:18:58,540
lighting people on fire other than war,
you know,

4222
03:18:58,600 --> 03:19:01,300
some horrible things that people have 
done when they've conquered cities.

4223
03:19:01,301 --> 03:19:04,510
They've lit entire villages On fire and 
shit along those lines,

4224
03:19:04,900 --> 03:19:08,740
but for the most part,
even the salem witch trials,

4225
03:19:08,800 --> 03:19:11,110
like most people think that they let 
those people on fire,

4226
03:19:11,800 --> 03:19:14,710
most of them were drowned.
That's what theY did with most of them.

4227
03:19:14,711 --> 03:19:16,660
They weren't burning witches at the 
stake really,

4228
03:19:16,900 --> 03:19:18,820
but they did drown a bunch of fucking 
people.

4229
03:19:19,240 --> 03:19:20,230
BuT they didn't,
they didn't,

4230
03:19:20,260 --> 03:19:21,760
they,
they've done it throughout history,

4231
03:19:21,761 --> 03:19:22,594
but it's not been something that they 
practiced on gay people to the point 

4232
03:19:24,911 --> 03:19:28,220
where that became the nickname because 
it was a bundle of woods.

4233
03:19:28,221 --> 03:19:29,054
They're going to light them on fire.
But people love to reiterate that 

4234
03:19:31,450 --> 03:19:34,930
without looking into it and it's uh,
it's still,

4235
03:19:36,400 --> 03:19:37,233
it's still a gross word when you're 
applying it to a homosexual person to 

4236
03:19:42,490 --> 03:19:43,990
sort of dehumanize them.

4237
03:19:44,020 --> 03:19:47,080
It's still gross term,
but that's not what it originally meant.

4238
03:19:47,770 --> 03:19:49,540
it meant a burden.
some woman,

4239
03:19:49,840 --> 03:19:51,460
yeah,
I've never heard the fire before,

4240
03:19:51,490 --> 03:19:54,460
but I've always heard the wood and like 
if you talk to your gay friends,

4241
03:19:54,870 --> 03:19:57,990
it's okay if you,
if they say it back to fourth year,

4242
03:19:58,000 --> 03:20:01,730
that we can do it around other dudes are
getting to the punch you gave.

4243
03:20:01,740 --> 03:20:02,710
Those are dudes,
man.

4244
03:20:02,830 --> 03:20:05,710
Hey,
I'm make sure that I'm correct on that.

4245
03:20:06,120 --> 03:20:09,220
I'm 99 percent sure I am,
but um,

4246
03:20:09,640 --> 03:20:10,440
the,
the,

4247
03:20:10,440 --> 03:20:11,273
the entomology of the word faggot and 
pretends to a burdensome woman as it 

4248
03:20:17,351 --> 03:20:18,184
pretends that it's one of those things 
just get sort of repeated as an urban 

4249
03:20:21,701 --> 03:20:23,380
myth or as a,
you know,

4250
03:20:24,670 --> 03:20:26,620
it's,
it's weird.

4251
03:20:26,890 --> 03:20:30,040
It's weird how many different fucking 
slurs there are for people.

4252
03:20:30,580 --> 03:20:31,413
You know,
it almost in some ways be better if 

4253
03:20:34,151 --> 03:20:38,800
there's just one and we use it 
universally [inaudible] what would yours

4254
03:20:38,801 --> 03:20:39,880
be?
Oh,

4255
03:20:40,690 --> 03:20:42,730
I like for everybody.
Like it's too,

4256
03:20:42,731 --> 03:20:46,840
it's too hard to call morons.
Like moron is always good.

4257
03:20:46,930 --> 03:20:48,470
I to say here at jimmy.

4258
03:20:50,660 --> 03:20:52,270
No,
make it a little bigger.

4259
03:20:52,300 --> 03:20:55,060
The word faggot,
it's been used in english since the late

4260
03:20:55,330 --> 03:20:57,730
16th century and his abusive term for 
women,

4261
03:20:58,210 --> 03:21:00,290
particularly old women,
uh,

4262
03:21:00,310 --> 03:21:04,180
in reference to homosexuality may derive
from this,

4263
03:21:04,181 --> 03:21:05,014
uh,
female,

4264
03:21:05,320 --> 03:21:06,153
uh,
as female terms are often used with 

4265
03:21:08,291 --> 03:21:11,800
reference to homosexual feminine men.
Uh,

4266
03:21:11,930 --> 03:21:12,191
duh,
duh,

4267
03:21:12,191 --> 03:21:13,840
duh duh.
Um,

4268
03:21:13,841 --> 03:21:14,674
what does it say?
The application of a term to a woman as 

4269
03:21:16,451 --> 03:21:17,284
possibly the shortening of the term 
faggot gatherer applied to 19th century 

4270
03:21:22,121 --> 03:21:24,880
people.
I'm going to call mIlo that from now on.

4271
03:21:25,410 --> 03:21:26,243
A especially older women who made a 
meager living by gathering and selling 

4272
03:21:30,521 --> 03:21:32,170
firewood.
Interesting.

4273
03:21:32,930 --> 03:21:33,763
Hmm.
Also the sense of something awkward to 

4274
03:21:36,371 --> 03:21:37,151
be carrIed.
Okay.

4275
03:21:37,151 --> 03:21:37,984
That's where it is.
So compared to the use of the word 

4276
03:21:40,301 --> 03:21:41,470
baggage.
Okay.

4277
03:21:41,530 --> 03:21:42,363
That makes sense.
As a pejorative term for old people in 

4278
03:21:45,050 --> 03:21:47,360
general.
So awkward to carry.

4279
03:21:48,110 --> 03:21:48,650
Okay.

4280
03:21:48,650 --> 03:21:49,940
Yeah.
So that's essentially it.

4281
03:21:50,210 --> 03:21:53,540
So that's where it came from.
The comparing men to women,

4282
03:21:53,600 --> 03:21:56,690
not comparing men to something that theY
light on fire.

4283
03:21:56,720 --> 03:21:58,280
So when people say that it's just not 
true,

4284
03:21:58,750 --> 03:22:02,030
still doesn't excuse people for slurs,
but we shouldn't lie,

4285
03:22:02,540 --> 03:22:03,770
you know.
And that's the problem wIth something.

4286
03:22:03,771 --> 03:22:04,604
Sounds so good.
You want to repeat it over and over 

4287
03:22:05,811 --> 03:22:06,770
again,
but it's not true.

4288
03:22:07,100 --> 03:22:07,761
Like,
yeah,

4289
03:22:07,761 --> 03:22:10,040
it's terrible to slur people.
Yes,

4290
03:22:10,041 --> 03:22:12,740
you're rIght.
But we should be honest about the origin

4291
03:22:12,741 --> 03:22:13,700
of words,
you know,

4292
03:22:13,840 --> 03:22:14,673
and that's not honest,
but It's something that gets repeated a 

4293
03:22:16,401 --> 03:22:18,590
lot and people don't look into it at 
all.

4294
03:22:18,890 --> 03:22:21,170
They just want to say it because it 
sounds awesome.

4295
03:22:21,470 --> 03:22:25,040
And when you say it well,
the reason why it's so offensive because

4296
03:22:25,041 --> 03:22:28,460
at one point in time that's what they 
use to describe a bundle of wood.

4297
03:22:28,670 --> 03:22:30,680
Okay.
So when you and your friends,

4298
03:22:30,681 --> 03:22:31,514
you think you're funny,
you think you're Casually calling each 

4299
03:22:33,171 --> 03:22:34,810
other faggots.
Okay.

4300
03:22:35,510 --> 03:22:39,440
Calling each other the other f word.
How long before faggot becomes the other

4301
03:22:39,441 --> 03:22:40,670
f word?
Is it already happened?

4302
03:22:41,960 --> 03:22:43,190
Is there any happened?
I think so,

4303
03:22:43,191 --> 03:22:44,024
right?

4304
03:22:46,520 --> 03:22:49,880
Riders on the storm.
Doom.

4305
03:22:49,881 --> 03:22:50,480
Doom,
doom,

4306
03:22:50,480 --> 03:22:51,313
doom.
