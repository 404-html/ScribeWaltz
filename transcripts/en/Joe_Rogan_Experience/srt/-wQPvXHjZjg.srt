00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:02,770
Hello freaky bitches.

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:08,280
I feel like if you created a situation
where Iran saw that there was much more

3
00:00:08,921 --> 00:00:13,450
to be gained from joining the Economic
Community and playing ball in accordance

4
00:00:13,451 --> 00:00:17,440
with its laws is then in getting
weapons of mass destruction.

5
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:20,530
They're all scared that those chicks
are going to find out they don't have to

6
00:00:20,531 --> 00:00:21,640
wear burkas in America.

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,650
Votes cover your cover,

8
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:28,540
your come over on boats and the
seek out black dick like a magnet,

9
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,210
like a magnet to steal filings.

10
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,460
Perhaps they're tired of being suppressed.

11
00:00:33,461 --> 00:00:35,350
They want a torque on some dude in a club,

12
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:39,040
maybe no crazy funky religious
outfit on and they can escape.

13
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:39,371
You know why?

14
00:00:39,371 --> 00:00:42,030
Because no one knows the fuck they look
like they could just blend right in.

15
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:44,710
Good luck in your passport photo when
it's looking through a fucking lit of a

16
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:47,490
garbage can like Oscar the
grouch and that's what you're,

17
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:49,010
that's what you're fucking passport.

18
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:50,410
It looks like he's here eyeballs.

19
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,660
I mean they have to take their
shit out for their basketball,

20
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:52,931
right?

21
00:00:52,931 --> 00:00:54,790
Don't they are they are loud too.

22
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:56,440
It's like stealing
their soul or something.

23
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:57,220
Right?

24
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:57,611
Well,

25
00:00:57,611 --> 00:00:57,780
I,

26
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,810
the minute that a lot of Saudi women goes
to places like London and quite guess

27
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:04,000
what comes off immediately
their head dress,

28
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:08,260
the whole burden of thing and then go
shopping and they dress sexy outfits and

29
00:01:08,261 --> 00:01:08,830
they're just like,

30
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:11,020
yeah cause Russian man.

31
00:01:11,021 --> 00:01:12,270
It's just amazing that you're,

32
00:01:12,271 --> 00:01:17,271
you've got countries that in 2015 still
make women dressed like they're in star

33
00:01:19,361 --> 00:01:19,700
wars.

34
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:20,890
This is not the reason for it.

35
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:22,063
Another reason for it.

36
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:23,830
There was not there very
logical reason for it.

37
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:24,701
Logical.

38
00:01:24,701 --> 00:01:26,050
Well I'm just saying if you're,

39
00:01:26,051 --> 00:01:26,411
if you're,

40
00:01:26,411 --> 00:01:26,951
if you're really,

41
00:01:26,951 --> 00:01:27,784
if you're a,

42
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:29,373
if you're a living,

43
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm just saying if you're a religious
man and if you are trying to create a

44
00:01:34,001 --> 00:01:35,050
productive society,

45
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,790
the logic went,

46
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:41,350
if you have women walking around
looking all sexy and naked,

47
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:43,360
which was a lot of the Middle East,

48
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,070
well if you have that,

49
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:49,630
what happens is we're thinking
about fucking and not producing.

50
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:50,440
Yeah.

51
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:55,090
So you've got it covers your chicks up
jam and she want to get any work done.

52
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,133
That's not true though.

53
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,160
I come to America producers
like a mother fucker about that.

54
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:02,890
How he got hot freaks over the hill.

55
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:04,240
It's so true.

56
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:04,870
Freedom.

57
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:05,590
Freedom.

58
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:08,410
Is that what you really
Prince Princess Leia.

59
00:02:08,411 --> 00:02:09,250
Is that a real body?

60
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:09,740
Yeah.

61
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:10,271
Damn Shit.

62
00:02:10,271 --> 00:02:15,271
A banging body as she did those
real to those pre pre suck and Tuck.

63
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:16,443
God bless her.

64
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:17,150
You know,

65
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:19,570
she didn't have no light Po
couldn't look more board.

66
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:20,950
Um,

67
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:22,270
she was beautiful at the time.

68
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:23,531
Very exotic.

69
00:02:23,531 --> 00:02:24,364
I must say.

70
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,213
Bruns Leo,

71
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,500
what does steel bro I
made out with her brother.

72
00:02:27,501 --> 00:02:28,334
I remember that Shit.

73
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:28,901
I love it.

74
00:02:28,901 --> 00:02:30,620
She kissed her brother and Ellipsis tick.

75
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:32,020
Is that true?

76
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:32,853
It had to.

77
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,780
He didn't know that it was his sister.

78
00:02:34,781 --> 00:02:35,501
That's rude.

79
00:02:35,501 --> 00:02:39,510
You sister comes along and gives you a
real kiss since he got some Univision

80
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,020
cheesy,

81
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,200
even bother telling you that she's,

82
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,510
did she know at the
time she knows she was?

83
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:43,810
No,

84
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:44,530
no one knew.

85
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:45,390
I don't know if

86
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:46,650
you've experienced this yet,

87
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:48,000
but for me,

88
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:48,780
you know,

89
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,780
I've hunted a lot and so I almost
like to punish myself and some,

90
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,590
I like it to be hard.

91
00:02:55,591 --> 00:02:56,670
I like to be a challenge.

92
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,590
So I will actually create it to be,

93
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:01,720
I just this hunt in New Zealand
where I was hunting these,

94
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:06,940
these fallow deer and at any given time
for the first few days I could have shot

95
00:03:06,941 --> 00:03:07,420
a deer.

96
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:11,080
Well if hunt a lot of people
don't realize as hunters,

97
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:13,420
it's not always the goal
to just go shoot something.

98
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:15,970
It's part of the experience.

99
00:03:15,971 --> 00:03:16,804
And so for me,

100
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:22,080
I just kept passing up animals because
the experience wasn't right until the

101
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:25,240
last day when I was supposed
to leave early and I end up,

102
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:25,391
oh,

103
00:03:25,391 --> 00:03:27,910
I'm just going to be hunting for
two hours and don't bring any water.

104
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:30,610
And I ended up hunting all day and going,

105
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,320
I don't even know how far,

106
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:34,000
18 miles maybe.

107
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,930
And I didn't bring any food,

108
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:36,820
any water and I'm hurting.

109
00:03:36,821 --> 00:03:39,520
And I ended up shooting a deer last light.

110
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:40,953
And,

111
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:44,980
and now is to me is awesome experience.

112
00:03:44,981 --> 00:03:47,050
It made the trip and made that memory,

113
00:03:47,051 --> 00:03:52,051
the hardship made the memory and something
that I as a hunter that non hunters

114
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:56,290
don't really maybe understand is
like having these antlers around.

115
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,540
And when the meets long gone,

116
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:02,410
I can look at that and remember the
hardship and the journey and the adventure

117
00:04:02,411 --> 00:04:06,520
and these other things
about the experience and the
meat was a bright product.

118
00:04:06,521 --> 00:04:07,930
But these are the memories that I like.

119
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:10,420
You look at that Moose and you think of
something completely different than I.

120
00:04:10,421 --> 00:04:12,220
Do you remember how it went down?

121
00:04:12,221 --> 00:04:13,090
You remember,

122
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:13,631
you know,

123
00:04:13,631 --> 00:04:18,010
maybe the struggle or carrying
the meat back or whatever.

124
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:21,810
So I've may have a rack in my house
that's sitting up on the mountain.

125
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:23,320
Why is that one on the mantle on that one?

126
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:23,711
Well,

127
00:04:23,711 --> 00:04:25,140
that one I had to work real hard for.

128
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:29,740
So I look at it and I think it reminds
me constantly of what I went through.

129
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,200
When you say that the
experience wasn't right,

130
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:32,450
what,

131
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:33,490
what do you mean by that?

132
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:37,390
Like I feel sometimes it
just wasn't a challenge.

133
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,790
It was I would have
been shooting an animal,

134
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:41,800
not the adventure wasn't there.

135
00:04:41,801 --> 00:04:42,940
The challenge wasn't there.

136
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:45,280
It just wasn't the right time.

137
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,860
I wanted to keep going until it,

138
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:49,000
until it happened.

139
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:49,690
I don't know.

140
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:50,350
It's a weird,

141
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:53,920
but for me hunting's about the
adventure and everything behind it,

142
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,980
and so as well as obviously getting meat,

143
00:04:56,981 --> 00:04:58,660
but there comes a point where you know,

144
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,271
okay,

145
00:04:59,271 --> 00:05:01,030
if I didn't get a deer this week,

146
00:05:01,031 --> 00:05:01,670
well maybe I'll,

147
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:02,590
I'll get one next week.

148
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,670
I'm not going to starve to death.

149
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,380
I've got a freezer with meat,

150
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:09,820
but I also want to keep that freezer full,

151
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:14,680
but so it comes to a point for me
where it's about other things as well,

152
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:15,550
the experience,

153
00:05:15,551 --> 00:05:16,450
the adventure,

154
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,033
the meat,

155
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,200
all combining into this.

156
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,430
If it's too easy,

157
00:05:21,431 --> 00:05:23,040
I just don't like it that fast.

158
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:23,510
I don't know.

159
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:24,310
It'll come.

160
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:24,851
It'll happen.

161
00:05:24,851 --> 00:05:25,420
You know?

162
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,470
For me it happened.

163
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:29,050
I started when I was younger.

164
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,670
I never wanted to stop hunting because I
liked the experience of being out there

165
00:05:33,671 --> 00:05:34,480
so much.

166
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,740
So I would do it.

167
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:39,490
A lot of people call trophy hunting and
I'm air quoting that because it means

168
00:05:39,491 --> 00:05:40,660
something different to me.

169
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:45,840
Or I would look for a bigger deer because
I wanted to keep hunting and make it

170
00:05:46,211 --> 00:05:47,710
more of a challenge for myself.

171
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:53,440
I find that quite remarkable that people
worry about this simply because it's

172
00:05:53,841 --> 00:05:57,020
not the way that people
actually think about anything.

173
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:04,240
Let's remember that the longevity aspect
of all of that work is a side effect.

174
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,860
I don't work on longevity.

175
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:07,840
I don't,

176
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,540
I work on [inaudible] the way you
might think if you read the papers,

177
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,120
I just work on health.

178
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:18,110
I'm just interested in stopping people
from getting sick when they get older.

179
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:20,750
Now if you think about it,

180
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,160
oh medicine is like that.

181
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:26,180
All medicine involves stopping people
from getting sick or fixing the other.

182
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:30,230
If they I affec and all Madison had a
side effect that people live longer than

183
00:06:30,231 --> 00:06:31,250
they otherwise would have done.

184
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:35,930
So the only real difference between the
work that sensory effect foundation dove

185
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,310
and the work that everything,

186
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:41,240
everyone else in medical referral
is a difference of degree.

187
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:46,690
The fact that the longevity side effect
of our work may be substantially greater

188
00:06:47,151 --> 00:06:49,550
than the longevity side effect
that we're familiar with.

189
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:51,200
It's still a side effect.

190
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,610
So if we come to the question,

191
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:54,590
how will I might one to live,

192
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:55,783
you know,

193
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:58,790
it's not even a meaningful question to me.

194
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:03,200
It's like saying what time would you
like to go to the toilet next Sunday?

195
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,513
You know,

196
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:07,190
we know that that's a dumb thing
to have an opinion about us.

197
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:12,320
It's a dumb thing to have an opinion
about because we know we're going to have

198
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:16,070
more information on the topic nearer the
time we were going to be able to act on

199
00:07:16,071 --> 00:07:18,510
the information and it's the same Dell,

200
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:19,520
you know,

201
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,600
nobody makes decisions on the basis
of how long ago they were bought.

202
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:27,650
People increasingly make decisions as
they get older on the basis of how long

203
00:07:27,651 --> 00:07:29,450
they think they've got to live,

204
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,660
but that's because the amount of time
they think they've got to live is going

205
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:33,494
down,

206
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,310
which it won't be going down anymore.

207
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,140
If you've got an arbitrary amount of time
behind you and other arbitrary amount

208
00:07:39,141 --> 00:07:40,100
of time ahead of you,

209
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,480
you're deficient backing.

210
00:07:41,481 --> 00:07:44,090
It's going to be based on more
short term considerations.

211
00:07:44,091 --> 00:07:44,720
You know,

212
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,460
like peer pressure and thought.

213
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:46,911
You know,

214
00:07:46,911 --> 00:07:48,410
I thought I'd point
out when people ask me,

215
00:07:48,411 --> 00:07:49,520
they things oftentimes say,

216
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:50,893
okay,

217
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,740
take yourself back to the
first time you got laid.

218
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:56,280
Oh yeah.

219
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:56,920
All right.

220
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,950
Now think about what you
were thinking at the time.

221
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,480
What are you thinking?

222
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:03,171
Oh my God.

223
00:08:03,171 --> 00:08:03,591
Oh my God,

224
00:08:03,591 --> 00:08:06,620
I have to get this person into bed right
now because I've only got another 60

225
00:08:06,621 --> 00:08:07,610
years to live.

226
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,340
I mean,

227
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,360
it's just ridiculous.

228
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:21,410
Okay.
