00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:02,850
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:03,900
I remember I was,

3
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:05,430
I met an older dude and we were,

4
00:00:05,431 --> 00:00:05,940
we were,

5
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:06,751
he was cool guy.

6
00:00:06,751 --> 00:00:07,530
We hung out.

7
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:08,363
That's how it starts.

8
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,290
I always starts with older dude.

9
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,100
We're in Wisconsin sweatsuit,

10
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:13,080
we're in Wisconsin,

11
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:14,400
the northwoods of Wisconsin.

12
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:18,510
Summertimes and I remember I meet
this guy and there was this girl,

13
00:00:18,511 --> 00:00:21,450
they're all two girls
older and we were like,

14
00:00:21,451 --> 00:00:21,781
oh,

15
00:00:21,781 --> 00:00:22,320
we were there.

16
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:22,801
I don't know,

17
00:00:22,801 --> 00:00:23,370
who cares?

18
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:24,360
Let's say 14,

19
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,610
13 or 14.

20
00:00:26,611 --> 00:00:28,800
It was so hot and I was 11,

21
00:00:28,801 --> 00:00:30,780
10 something beyond even younger,

22
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:32,200
younger because I'll tell you why.

23
00:00:32,201 --> 00:00:33,034
I know I was younger.

24
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:36,950
So I am hanging out with this guy and uh,

25
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,070
we can we keep.

26
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:38,550
We keep.

27
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:38,881
And I'm,

28
00:00:38,881 --> 00:00:40,040
I was sexual pervert.

29
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:40,903
How old is he?

30
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:41,850
Well,

31
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:42,710
I'll tell you open.

32
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,550
I'm going to tell you how
I know he was a lot older.

33
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:44,821
Ready?

34
00:00:44,821 --> 00:00:45,590
This is how you,

35
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:46,010
this is,

36
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:46,843
this is why I'm going.

37
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:47,700
This is the point.

38
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:49,530
So we start.

39
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,730
I actually say we should try to have
sex with those girls trying to conspire.

40
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,530
I don't know how old I was
or at least I was like,

41
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:57,480
we should try to see their boobs.

42
00:00:57,481 --> 00:00:58,370
I don't know what I was
saying to me because.

43
00:00:58,410 --> 00:00:58,621
Yes,

44
00:00:58,621 --> 00:00:59,520
that's a great plan.

45
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,560
So we're talking,

46
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:02,100
he goes calm.

47
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,020
We have to go into the woods
and come up with a plan.

48
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:05,180
So No.

49
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:05,400
Yeah,

50
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:05,940
so I'm like,

51
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:06,630
alright,

52
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,980
so we go to the God damn it.

53
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:11,820
No wonder you've been molested several.

54
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:14,760
The next thing I know this
is coming through now.

55
00:01:14,761 --> 00:01:17,660
The next time that he pulled his pants
down and I noticed how Harry is assets.

56
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:18,550
So I go,

57
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:19,830
that's weird if there is,

58
00:01:19,831 --> 00:01:21,750
there's this dick and his ass.

59
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:23,310
And he had,

60
00:01:23,311 --> 00:01:25,230
he lies down and he goes,

61
00:01:25,231 --> 00:01:27,090
do you wanna do you wanna
rub on top of me or no?

62
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:27,841
And I go,

63
00:01:27,841 --> 00:01:29,520
I don't think so.

64
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:30,853
I was like,

65
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,710
rub on me or no,

66
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:33,843
I was young.

67
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,460
I was young enough to have to think about.

68
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,180
Imagine if that's like fucking go to la.

69
00:01:39,181 --> 00:01:40,050
I swear to God,

70
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:40,410
you know,

71
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:42,210
how do you get these
kids to fuck you dude,

72
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,170
this is all you have to do.

73
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,910
You lie down and you go,

74
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,000
do you want to rub on top of me?

75
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:48,150
I know I can always just start fucking

76
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,640
spit on your asshole
and start paddling away.

77
00:01:53,641 --> 00:01:54,500
They all do it.

78
00:01:54,501 --> 00:01:55,410
It's like hypnosis.

79
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,250
He laid down with great.

80
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,520
It wasn't like he was bent lakes.

81
00:01:58,530 --> 00:01:58,900
Right.

82
00:01:58,900 --> 00:01:59,100
They,

83
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,030
you want to rub on top of me,

84
00:02:00,031 --> 00:02:00,251
you know,

85
00:02:00,251 --> 00:02:00,900
and I go,

86
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,640
I don't think I was just curious.

87
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:03,150
Yeah.

88
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,140
I saw the crack and I was like,

89
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:04,650
I was like,

90
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:05,580
do I say yes?

91
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,091
I was like,

92
00:02:06,091 --> 00:02:07,350
this is vaguely sexual.

93
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:07,950
And I go,

94
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:08,491
no,

95
00:02:08,491 --> 00:02:08,971
I don't think so.

96
00:02:08,971 --> 00:02:11,400
So then he gets up and he goes,

97
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:11,791
all right,

98
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:13,600
well just hold off for
a second and he starts,

99
00:02:13,601 --> 00:02:14,431
I'm going to show you something.

100
00:02:14,431 --> 00:02:14,731
And I go,

101
00:02:14,731 --> 00:02:15,080
all right.

102
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,070
He starts jerking off and I go,

103
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:19,210
I go,

104
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:20,260
I take all my Tutu to.

105
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,270
I used to rubbing as my mother called her.

106
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:23,971
So,

107
00:02:23,971 --> 00:02:24,620
um,

108
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,110
I go,

109
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:25,530
so he's,

110
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:25,830
he's,

111
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:28,320
he's winking off and that
was the first time he goes,

112
00:02:28,321 --> 00:02:28,591
hold on,

113
00:02:28,591 --> 00:02:28,920
ready,

114
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,370
ready?

115
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:29,990
And I go,

116
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:30,450
yeah,

117
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,430
and he comes on you.

118
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,690
He busted in your face,

119
00:02:33,691 --> 00:02:34,231
not on my face.

120
00:02:34,231 --> 00:02:35,640
He just shoot and I go,

121
00:02:35,641 --> 00:02:36,510
what the fuck?

122
00:02:36,511 --> 00:02:37,260
I go,

123
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,041
what's that white?

124
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:38,910
I couldn't believe it.

125
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,890
Seeing white stuff is the
first time I saw somebody.

126
00:02:40,891 --> 00:02:41,261
A jacket.

127
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:41,550
Oh,

128
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:42,330
hold on.

129
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:42,960
She,

130
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,590
you were watching this do jack off in
the woods for a solid four minutes.

131
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:47,131
Hey Man.

132
00:02:47,131 --> 00:02:48,130
And US courage ma'am.

133
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,260
What were you saying to them?

134
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,490
I don't remember.

135
00:02:50,491 --> 00:02:51,151
It was so long ago.

136
00:02:51,151 --> 00:02:52,300
He goes on.

137
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:53,821
Hold on.

138
00:02:53,821 --> 00:02:55,250
You called this Mr. Yeah,

139
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:56,011
hold on.

140
00:02:56,011 --> 00:02:56,341
He was like,

141
00:02:56,341 --> 00:02:56,740
watch this.

142
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,120
Wait,

143
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,331
wait,

144
00:02:57,331 --> 00:02:57,751
wait a minute.

145
00:02:57,751 --> 00:02:58,140
Hold on.

146
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:58,973
Wait for it.

147
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,210
And it's going to happen.

148
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:00,940
And then we went.

149
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,800
Then we left and we went
and spy on those girls.

150
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:04,590
You hung out with them after that?

151
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,320
I did assured that you watched a
grown man Jack off bus near you.

152
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:09,220
Not on your face.

153
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,600
Then you went to go find chicks.

154
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:11,680
Know what man?

155
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,030
When you were 11 years old.

156
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:16,330
Weird Shit can happen to you
to this 11 year old hockey.

157
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,200
Hell No.

158
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:17,891
You got lucky.

159
00:03:17,891 --> 00:03:19,330
But I'm not saying that
would have happened.

160
00:03:19,331 --> 00:03:20,860
You would've stood around
with a guy jerked off.

161
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,410
But I am saying it's possible that a guy,

162
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,371
when you were 11,

163
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:25,600
could've lied down and say,

164
00:03:25,601 --> 00:03:25,871
Hey,

165
00:03:25,871 --> 00:03:27,160
you want to rub on top of mayor know?

166
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,001
And you would have been like,

167
00:03:28,001 --> 00:03:28,870
what the fuck?

168
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,080
Yeah.

169
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,900
It's good to have fatty foods is fun.

170
00:03:31,901 --> 00:03:33,040
Sometimes it's not.

171
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:33,581
It's not.

172
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:38,581
I don't believe it's good to miss out on
all the pleasures in life because some

173
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:39,610
people get hooked on them.

174
00:03:39,611 --> 00:03:39,911
I sing.

175
00:03:39,911 --> 00:03:41,070
I think that's horseshit.

176
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:41,770
I agree.

177
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:44,290
Like Bacon is fucking delicious.

178
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:45,400
I'm not quitting.

179
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,410
I will never stop eating bacon.

180
00:03:47,411 --> 00:03:48,820
It's not going to fucking happen.

181
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,050
It's too good.

182
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:54,010
When I sit there and I'm chewing
on a crispy piece of Bacon,

183
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:56,080
this cooked maybe just a little too long,

184
00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:01,290
but it's just crunching on my mouth and
the saltiness and the sweetness of the

185
00:04:01,331 --> 00:04:02,260
pig fat.

186
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:05,980
It's just warm and melting in
my mouth as I chew it down.

187
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:09,970
Breaking down the crispy fat.

188
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:11,703
I'm not.

189
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,641
I'm not stopping.

190
00:04:12,641 --> 00:04:13,990
Never have any Naza.

191
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:17,560
If you bake bacon at like four,

192
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,860
25 or 20 minutes,

193
00:04:18,861 --> 00:04:19,694
whatever it is,

194
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:20,481
the perfect.

195
00:04:20,481 --> 00:04:20,711
I mean,

196
00:04:20,711 --> 00:04:20,830
it's,

197
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:24,740
it's translucent and it melts in your
mouth and I swear to God of dictates like

198
00:04:24,741 --> 00:04:24,921
that.

199
00:04:24,921 --> 00:04:25,970
My Dad had bruised knees.

200
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,190
Like I fucking love Bacon.

201
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:29,773
I was telling Jay,

202
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,220
was I telling you today I haven't had a

203
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:33,643
bruised knees.

204
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:35,150
I fucking love that taste.

205
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:35,810
Well,

206
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:37,610
wolf is one of the Paleo Diet.

207
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:41,180
Pioneer guys wanted to just sort
of genius fitness health guy.

208
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:44,000
He slow cooks bacon every morning.

209
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:44,631
He's like,

210
00:04:44,631 --> 00:04:45,650
it's a ritual.

211
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,530
He gets that fat bacon from wholefoods,

212
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:51,040
Bacon's dude,

213
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:55,130
and he puts on this fucking
slow bacon cooker and he's like,

214
00:04:55,131 --> 00:04:56,720
as I'm getting ready for my day,

215
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:57,471
I'm going through my day.

216
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,420
It's smelling the Aromas,

217
00:04:59,421 --> 00:05:00,590
filling the house.

218
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:01,070
It's like a,

219
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,870
there's a bunch of experiences going on.

220
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:03,740
I'm like,

221
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:04,281
God damn,

222
00:05:04,281 --> 00:05:05,210
these poor vegans,

223
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,260
these poor bastards.

224
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:06,900
My wife,

225
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:07,381
my wife.

226
00:05:07,381 --> 00:05:10,680
You know how like women have sense like
a woman to have a sense when you start

227
00:05:10,681 --> 00:05:10,891
dating.

228
00:05:10,891 --> 00:05:11,130
They were like,

229
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:11,230
oh,

230
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:12,230
shanice smells like strawberry.

231
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,360
Smells like Bacon.

232
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:13,760
I had a,

233
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,610
I had a chick one time,

234
00:05:14,611 --> 00:05:15,780
it smelled like fucking Bologna.

235
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:16,623
He was like,

236
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,840
Adam Dana for two years process.

237
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:19,620
But uh,

238
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,380
but my wife's smells like Bacon every
morning she makes the same thing.

239
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:23,850
She's southern bacon,

240
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:24,750
eggs,

241
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,600
biscuits and fruit for the
kids every fucking morning.

242
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:28,463
Good call,

243
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:28,951
good call.

244
00:05:28,951 --> 00:05:29,820
That's a good backrest.

245
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,430
My house reeks of bay.

246
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,300
I'd even take my bacon
game to the next level.

247
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,500
When you go to buy your Bacon,

248
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,270
if you buy it at like
just a regular story,

249
00:05:36,271 --> 00:05:37,970
they have the thick cut you get.

250
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,360
Don't get the thick cut that spread out.

251
00:05:39,361 --> 00:05:40,290
Like playing cards,

252
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:40,710
like,

253
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:41,580
like fanned out,

254
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:44,190
get the thick cut that's
packed in like dollar bills.

255
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,000
And then look at this.

256
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:50,220
You've got to make sure that the beginning
to the end of that thick cut is even.

257
00:05:50,221 --> 00:05:51,270
You don't want any dips in it.

258
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,070
Go for fucking straight even.

259
00:05:53,071 --> 00:05:55,080
That's the most amount of bacon
you can get for your money.

260
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,593
I'll take them my bay.

261
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:58,050
I'm taking my pink and pretty seriously

262
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,330
needs to go to a butcher.

263
00:05:59,331 --> 00:06:00,890
That's when you take into the next level,

264
00:06:00,891 --> 00:06:01,460
right?

265
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,810
When you're really taking the next level,

266
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:05,720
when you raise your own fucking pigs walk,

267
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:06,800
raise your own pigs,

268
00:06:06,801 --> 00:06:08,690
get friendly with them and then
shoot them right in the head,

269
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:10,580
oh my God,

270
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:14,510
I'm going to lean my headlights into
your bedroom windows through blah blah,

271
00:06:14,511 --> 00:06:14,810
blah,

272
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:15,870
redneck crazy redneck,

273
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,550
crazy for fuck.

274
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,170
But that.

275
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:18,450
I mean,

276
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:19,280
and people,

277
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,790
it's playing on pop radio because it
strikes a chord and I think some girls

278
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:23,270
think,

279
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:23,571
man,

280
00:06:23,571 --> 00:06:24,610
he really was into,

281
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,101
you know,

282
00:06:25,101 --> 00:06:25,460
he,

283
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:28,940
he really loved her because look at what
he's doing on the other side and that's

284
00:06:28,941 --> 00:06:29,480
just the.

285
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:33,350
That's just a tricky little trap that
we got to transcend the least of my

286
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:34,070
concerns.

287
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:37,440
My concerns is that there'll be guys that
listened to it and think it's okay to

288
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:41,420
act like that if a girl is so
silly that she thinks all that.

289
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,590
He just loves him.

290
00:06:42,591 --> 00:06:44,150
That's why he's all doing that.

291
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,290
Shooting up the house.

292
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:46,124
Shit.

293
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,860
You think he really wants to shoot up
it's fucking house and just letting her

294
00:06:48,861 --> 00:06:49,694
know he loves

295
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,480
his women who grow up like that.

296
00:06:53,481 --> 00:06:56,150
They all fucking black guy and there
having this conversation to their kid with

297
00:06:56,151 --> 00:06:58,640
a Marlboro hanging out of
their mouth lists and sugar.

298
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:03,280
Your Dad and I have very passionate
relationship and I pushed his buttons and

299
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:03,680
you know,

300
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,020
and he loves me and if he didn't love me,

301
00:07:06,021 --> 00:07:08,990
he wouldn't fucking hit me and I know
I don't make sense to you right now,

302
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,280
but someday we'll.

303
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:11,940
Yeah,

304
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:12,773
that's it.

305
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:17,990
That's this old paradigm that is in dire
need of transcendence and the need is

306
00:07:18,801 --> 00:07:19,634
basically,

307
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:19,911
you know,

308
00:07:19,911 --> 00:07:21,320
we have to be fully full.

309
00:07:21,321 --> 00:07:23,420
I think Don Miguel Ruiz
makes the example of,

310
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:24,410
you know,

311
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:25,610
create enough self,

312
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:26,110
love enough,

313
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:30,020
self satisfaction enough inside yourself
that you don't need anything from

314
00:07:30,021 --> 00:07:30,854
anybody else.

315
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:33,350
Your kitchen is fully stocked
so you're not starving.

316
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:38,660
You stock your own kitchen with your
own self fulfillment and then you don't

317
00:07:38,661 --> 00:07:41,720
need to eat any little burger that comes
on the side of the road or something.

318
00:07:41,721 --> 00:07:42,830
Hot Dog from a stand.

319
00:07:42,831 --> 00:07:44,360
Whatever you can get
because you're starving.

320
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:45,830
You got plenty to eat.

321
00:07:45,831 --> 00:07:46,281
And that's,

322
00:07:46,281 --> 00:07:47,660
I think the analogy that we need to have.

323
00:07:47,661 --> 00:07:51,530
We need to be full and whole and we need
to have standards as human beings we

324
00:07:51,531 --> 00:07:53,240
accept of ourselves,

325
00:07:53,241 --> 00:07:55,040
like what you shouldn't
accept from yourself.

326
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:57,560
Don't accept from yourself that you're
the guy that's going to be outside

327
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:58,910
someone's house at 3:00 in the morning,

328
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:01,430
shiny head light to their fucking
windows and throwing beer cans.

329
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:02,810
Don't accept that you're that guy.

330
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,310
You're not.

331
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:05,600
You can't be that guy if you're that guy.

332
00:08:05,601 --> 00:08:07,310
No one's gonna come to you for advice.

333
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,990
No one's going to take you seriously.

334
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:09,191
You're.

335
00:08:09,191 --> 00:08:10,490
You're a fucking dumb ass.

336
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:14,420
You're a dumb ass child
who gives into every whim.

337
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,890
It's like someone who comes
after one stroke every time.

338
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:17,450
I can't help,

339
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:19,520
but like you're a baby.

340
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:20,930
You're a fucking baby.

341
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,850
You learned some goddamn discipline.

342
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:23,301
Yeah,

343
00:08:23,301 --> 00:08:23,901
it sucks.

344
00:08:23,901 --> 00:08:24,111
Yeah.

345
00:08:24,111 --> 00:08:24,921
You feel lonely?

346
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:25,191
Yeah.

347
00:08:25,191 --> 00:08:26,040
You depressed.

348
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,260
Go on tinder stupid.

349
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,670
Fuck more chicks.

350
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:29,331
They're everywhere.

351
00:08:29,331 --> 00:08:30,200
People want to fuck.

352
00:08:30,201 --> 00:08:30,980
They love it.

353
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,210
That's why there's so many of us.

354
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:33,050
What are you doing,

355
00:08:33,051 --> 00:08:33,650
man?

356
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:34,990
You telling me you get this one chick,

357
00:08:34,991 --> 00:08:35,990
you can't get another check.

358
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:36,880
Go get another one.

359
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,221
Stupid,

360
00:08:37,221 --> 00:08:38,110
and he will too.

361
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:38,780
That's the thing.

362
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:39,860
Do not have any friends,

363
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,090
not have any friends,

364
00:08:41,091 --> 00:08:42,920
anybody that talks you
through it and goes,

365
00:08:42,921 --> 00:08:43,191
do,

366
00:08:43,191 --> 00:08:43,461
do,

367
00:08:43,461 --> 00:08:43,730
do.

368
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:44,690
Come on,

369
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:45,471
let's go.

370
00:08:45,471 --> 00:08:46,304
So what?

371
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:50,250
People get so goddamn
connected when they date,

372
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:55,030
they get so fucking connected that they
feel like you stole something from them

373
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:58,680
who have been getting some
pleasure from another entity.

374
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:00,840
I'm tolerating it.

375
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,600
Sent us bust up your sleep patterns.

376
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,050
I'm going to fuck with your Beta waves.

377
00:09:06,051 --> 00:09:09,030
So I'm going to kick your fucking
rem sleep right in the deck.

378
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,860
You fuck with me?

379
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,023
You fuck with

380
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:14,423
fallon?

381
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:16,420
It fucks with your sleep bank.

382
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:18,060
That's what he's doing.

383
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:19,500
He's a fucking baby.
