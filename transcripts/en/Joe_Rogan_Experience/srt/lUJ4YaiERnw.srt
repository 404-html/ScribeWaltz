1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,340
The joe rogan experience and I,

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:05,640
and I'm not going to be because I tried,

3
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:06,603
uh,

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:09,520
we eat yeah.

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:14,780
Once two years ago and I stayed
hide for 14 days straight to God,

6
00:00:16,931 --> 00:00:17,460
man.

7
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:18,091
Did you eat it?

8
00:00:18,091 --> 00:00:18,661
14 days.

9
00:00:18,661 --> 00:00:19,560
900 he smoked.

10
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:20,700
He wasn't a vaporizer.

11
00:00:20,701 --> 00:00:21,050
Is that,

12
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:21,440
yeah.

13
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,380
Vaporize vaporizer.

14
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:23,283
Yeah.

15
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:27,930
And I say hi for 14 days and
I thought it doesn't right.

16
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:28,780
He doesn't,

17
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:29,461
I wasn't high.

18
00:00:29,461 --> 00:00:30,200
Right.

19
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,033
Well hopefully it wasn't,

20
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:35,610
but I thought it was like
disconnected from reality.

21
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,990
Well sometimes that does happen and I
know a story about a guy who is a straight

22
00:00:39,991 --> 00:00:44,580
laced guy who took some marijuana edible
so that he could get to sleep and he

23
00:00:44,581 --> 00:00:46,440
had a real problem.

24
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:51,650
Like he got suicidal and freaked out
and became just irrationally anxious.

25
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:57,390
He had crippling anxiety and some
time for some time for weeks.

26
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:01,290
And he's a confident
guy and a very handsome,

27
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,790
big muscular guy.

28
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:03,660
Like he just like,

29
00:01:03,661 --> 00:01:05,820
you would never imagine this
guy have any antianxiety.

30
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:10,650
I think some people have just the
chemistry of different individuals.

31
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,860
I wasn't bar for death and that's what
the doctor told me because I went to the

32
00:01:13,861 --> 00:01:14,694
psychiatrist.

33
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:15,631
Wow,

34
00:01:15,631 --> 00:01:16,464
you went to this like

35
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:18,600
I swear to God,

36
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,950
I'm dead week.

37
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,450
That week I went to the psych guy
through smell and I told him no,

38
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:27,790
I smoked that thing like 14
days ago and I still high.

39
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:28,851
And he,

40
00:01:28,851 --> 00:01:31,170
he looked at me and he gave me some,

41
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,930
some cycle one.

42
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,630
He gave me some pills and I was like,

43
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:36,990
Oh,

44
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,660
if you stay high until tomorrow,

45
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:39,570
take these pills.

46
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,040
Because what he told me,

47
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:46,041
it's something that I didn't know that
he can be a trigger if you're has some

48
00:01:46,051 --> 00:01:51,051
tennis of schizophrenia and a
psychopath or if you feel have,

49
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:52,740
which was not my case.

50
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,300
And He's told this is very rare,

51
00:01:54,301 --> 00:01:55,200
but he can't happen,

52
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,520
which is not your case.

53
00:01:56,521 --> 00:01:56,841
And I,

54
00:01:56,841 --> 00:02:01,841
it was happy because of the up and the
next day I was okay and I felt okay and I

55
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:04,950
did it took the pills and it was crazy,

56
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,793
man.

57
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:06,451
It's crazy.

58
00:02:06,451 --> 00:02:08,880
And I remember that I
decided to record it,

59
00:02:08,881 --> 00:02:09,810
but I was like,

60
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:10,060
like,

61
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:10,360
Hey,

62
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,070
let me,

63
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:13,350
let me record what I'm thinking.

64
00:02:13,351 --> 00:02:15,420
At least let's get some
good experience out of it.

65
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,090
And I remember that it
started to record and I said,

66
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:18,470
uh,

67
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,760
now I'm going to record
everything that I'm thinking.

68
00:02:20,761 --> 00:02:22,560
And when I look at the cell phone,

69
00:02:22,561 --> 00:02:23,550
it was 45 minutes,

70
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,070
45 minutes to talk.

71
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,920
And I didn't even realize I just
said that I'm going to record now.

72
00:02:28,921 --> 00:02:32,790
And there was 45 minutes and when I
listened to like 15 days after that,

73
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:33,750
I was like,

74
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,411
I'm so crazy.

75
00:02:34,411 --> 00:02:35,244
I'm so crazy.

76
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,993
So crazy.

77
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,123
I'm going to die.

78
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,830
I'm never going to understand
on my son's talking,

79
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:42,780
talking to me right now.

80
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,100
Wow.

81
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,580
That was one hit of available.

82
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:46,310
No,

83
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,520
it was more than one.

84
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,210
A bunch of hits.

85
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,200
He was a bunch.

86
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:49,620
Oh,

87
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,520
you're too tall.

88
00:02:50,521 --> 00:02:51,091
You're big.

89
00:02:51,091 --> 00:02:53,610
You're like a 250 pounds.

90
00:02:53,611 --> 00:02:55,470
So fucking use it a lot.

91
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:55,700
Oh,

92
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,660
so they were saying keep
hitting it because you're tall.

93
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,920
Because I wasn't feeling it.

94
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,070
Oh No.

95
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,150
But when I felt it,

96
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:04,240
I felt for 14 and you know,

97
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,650
having that belief does,

98
00:03:05,651 --> 00:03:06,910
does add up to that.

99
00:03:06,911 --> 00:03:10,420
I mean that's step one in my opinion is
visualize a nam believing it and on the

100
00:03:10,421 --> 00:03:11,200
flip side,

101
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:16,200
having a negative self worth or a negative
opinion of what you're about to do or

102
00:03:16,301 --> 00:03:20,260
a negative thought about the future
can also manifest all sorts of terrible

103
00:03:20,261 --> 00:03:20,830
results.

104
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:21,491
Absolutely.

105
00:03:21,491 --> 00:03:22,300
Absolutely.

106
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,760
Gotta think placebo
effect is a real thing.

107
00:03:24,761 --> 00:03:25,301
We know that,

108
00:03:25,301 --> 00:03:25,601
right?

109
00:03:25,601 --> 00:03:29,710
We know that if you really do believe
that you're going to get better because of

110
00:03:29,711 --> 00:03:31,150
some sugar pill they give you,

111
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,010
there's a tangible result,

112
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:36,430
100% if you really believe that salt guy,

113
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,280
if the thing about all
that stupid shit is,

114
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:40,570
if you believe it,

115
00:03:40,571 --> 00:03:41,930
it actually has an effect.

116
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:42,730
There's,

117
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:47,380
there's a lot of healers out there that
at least on paper are totally full of

118
00:03:47,381 --> 00:03:48,070
shit.

119
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:50,080
But if you believe in these assholes,

120
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:50,770
yeah,

121
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:51,780
I can make a difference.

122
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,500
It's very slippery.

123
00:03:53,501 --> 00:03:55,990
The human mind is such a slippery thing.

124
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:56,521
I mean,

125
00:03:56,521 --> 00:03:58,810
and I'll go back to my
own experience and again,

126
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,240
I don't know how a femoral
are out there you want to get,

127
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:04,630
but I'm out there in
Antarctica 54 days alone.

128
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,970
Like I'm telling you I'm doing
this for this bigger purpose.

129
00:04:06,971 --> 00:04:11,440
I'm feel like I'm tapped into that and
like legitimately there were moments,

130
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:12,221
at least for me,

131
00:04:12,221 --> 00:04:13,960
whether I'm manifesting that in my mind,

132
00:04:13,961 --> 00:04:14,980
whatever you want to call it,

133
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:18,670
that I am actually feeling energetically
uplifted by the people pushing me on.

134
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,460
Like there were days that were incredibly
hard where I would sit there and I'd

135
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:22,180
be like,

136
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:22,571
oh my God,

137
00:04:22,571 --> 00:04:23,860
I don't know if I can
do this and I'm done.

138
00:04:23,861 --> 00:04:24,551
Like boom.

139
00:04:24,551 --> 00:04:25,440
Like I would get over,

140
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,250
I would hit with this
sort of larger purpose,

141
00:04:27,251 --> 00:04:28,990
that's larger outcome and again,

142
00:04:28,991 --> 00:04:29,830
like I'm not,

143
00:04:29,831 --> 00:04:31,720
I'm not a super religious person.

144
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,390
I was actually raised on a hippie commune.

145
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,440
Like I come from a pretty
untraditional background,

146
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,360
but like the energetic field,

147
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:40,120
whatever you want to call that or if
that's just the belief in something,

148
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:40,601
you know,

149
00:04:40,601 --> 00:04:41,500
the power of that.

150
00:04:41,501 --> 00:04:43,630
Like I felt the strength
from those moments.

151
00:04:43,631 --> 00:04:46,660
There was moments when my body's
switched from kind of being negative.

152
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:47,141
Oh my God,

153
00:04:47,141 --> 00:04:48,010
another hard day out here.

154
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,431
Oh my God,

155
00:04:48,431 --> 00:04:50,890
it's minus 25 to tapping
into those flow states.

156
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:51,790
So again,

157
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:52,060
I don't,

158
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,740
I don't have perfect words for that.

159
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:54,220
Um,

160
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:54,431
you know,

161
00:04:54,431 --> 00:04:56,800
I'm starting to try to build
my vocabulary around that.

162
00:04:56,801 --> 00:04:57,940
But that energy,

163
00:04:57,941 --> 00:04:59,320
I think it was derived
from what you're saying.

164
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:00,550
If you start to believe it,

165
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:01,630
if you can believe like,

166
00:05:01,631 --> 00:05:01,901
hey,

167
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:03,070
there's a larger purpose in this,

168
00:05:03,071 --> 00:05:03,431
or hey,

169
00:05:03,431 --> 00:05:05,920
this blue force fields A's and one foot,

170
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,130
there is something that
if you can originate that
positivity in your mind that I

171
00:05:09,131 --> 00:05:11,590
think can give us incredible
amounts of strength,

172
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,270
um,

173
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:12,491
and,

174
00:05:12,491 --> 00:05:13,930
and then we can tap
into something greater.

175
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,740
And so imagine being this guy getting
medals and awards for helping create jobs

176
00:05:17,741 --> 00:05:22,240
around the country and then realizing
that automation is coming like a tidal

177
00:05:22,241 --> 00:05:26,470
wave and that your efforts that you're
getting applauded for really not going to

178
00:05:26,471 --> 00:05:27,304
do the trick.

179
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:31,810
And then Donald Trump wins the election
in 2016 and for whatever reason,

180
00:05:31,811 --> 00:05:32,561
in my opinion,

181
00:05:32,561 --> 00:05:35,260
the media is just not being honest
about all the economic drivers.

182
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:37,510
They're blaming racism,

183
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:39,760
Russia base book,

184
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:40,840
the FBI.

185
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,650
And if you look at the voter district
data on a district by district basis,

186
00:05:44,651 --> 00:05:49,120
there's a straight line up between the
adoption of industrial robots in that

187
00:05:49,121 --> 00:05:51,610
voting district and the
movement towards Trump.

188
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:57,440
Like it's a straight economic story where
we blasted away 4 million jobs in the

189
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:01,550
swing states and Donald
Trump is our president.

190
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:05,210
So imagine being me and then
seeing that and being like,

191
00:06:05,211 --> 00:06:06,044
okay,

192
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,130
I get it.

193
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:08,210
This is an economic,

194
00:06:08,211 --> 00:06:09,410
technological story.

195
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:12,020
And then I went to
people in Washington DC.

196
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:12,621
I was like,

197
00:06:12,621 --> 00:06:13,011
hey guys,

198
00:06:13,011 --> 00:06:13,700
what are we going to do?

199
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:17,270
We're in the third inning of the
greatest economic and technological

200
00:06:17,271 --> 00:06:19,160
transformation in the
history of our country.

201
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,530
And the third inning has
brought us Donald Trump.

202
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:22,611
The fourth,

203
00:06:22,611 --> 00:06:22,911
fifth,

204
00:06:22,911 --> 00:06:24,860
sixth endings are going to be horrific.

205
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:26,660
What are we going to do?

206
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:31,190
And then the answers I got were somewhere
between disappointing and horrifying,

207
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,800
where if you go to mainstream
politicians and you're like,

208
00:06:33,801 --> 00:06:34,634
what are we going to do?

209
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:37,400
The answers I got were
literally number one.

210
00:06:37,401 --> 00:06:38,600
We cannot talk about that.

211
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,461
Number two,

212
00:06:40,461 --> 00:06:41,480
we should study that.

213
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,020
We cannot talk about that.

214
00:06:43,021 --> 00:06:43,251
That was,

215
00:06:43,251 --> 00:06:44,630
that's verbatim really.

216
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:45,440
Yeah.

217
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,550
And why were they saying that?

218
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:51,170
Because it seems alarmists
like anti progress or like,

219
00:06:51,171 --> 00:06:51,840
you know,

220
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,551
you're like,

221
00:06:52,551 --> 00:06:53,360
uh,

222
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:53,720
you know,

223
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,570
throwing stones at like,

224
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,890
like big tech companies and it's like,

225
00:06:57,891 --> 00:06:58,730
I'm not throwing stones at anyone.

226
00:06:58,730 --> 00:06:59,780
I'm just pointing out the fact.

227
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,370
So number one is,

228
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:02,090
uh,

229
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,560
so number one was can't talk about it.

230
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:04,910
Number two was need to study it.

231
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:07,790
And the number three was the
point you made a originally,

232
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:10,760
which was we must educate and retrain
Americans for the jobs of the future.

233
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,170
And then when I was like,

234
00:07:12,171 --> 00:07:12,411
Hey,

235
00:07:12,411 --> 00:07:14,900
we're terrible at that by the numbers,

236
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:16,400
then they'd literally be like,

237
00:07:16,401 --> 00:07:16,581
well,

238
00:07:16,581 --> 00:07:18,230
I guess we'll learn to
get better at it then.

239
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:18,890
And then I,

240
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:21,860
so I came back to my home in
New York City and I was like,

241
00:07:21,861 --> 00:07:22,694
oh my gosh,

242
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:26,590
we are so backward and far gone as a,

243
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:27,980
certainly as a government.

244
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:28,790
Um,

245
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:31,760
and so then I was grappling with
it and I'm a parent like you are.

246
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,470
And I looked at my kids and I was like,

247
00:07:33,471 --> 00:07:35,690
am I really going to bring
them up in this shit show?

248
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,270
Like,

249
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:36,990
is this really the,

250
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,000
is this really the plan?

251
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,560
And so then I was like,

252
00:07:39,561 --> 00:07:40,310
okay,

253
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:43,280
how would you actually
solve this problem if you,

254
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,300
if you had to do so?

255
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,470
And so then I said,

256
00:07:45,471 --> 00:07:46,304
okay,

257
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,540
universal basic income,

258
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:50,480
rebranded the freedom dividend after we
did a bunch of tests because it tests

259
00:07:50,481 --> 00:07:54,620
much better as the freedom dividend
and universal basic income and,

260
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:57,240
and then try and make the,

261
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:01,160
the rules of the economy work better
for more people as fast as we can before

262
00:08:01,161 --> 00:08:03,670
this automation wave really crescendo.

263
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:04,430
And then,

264
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,263
uh,

265
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:06,340
okay,

266
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,173
sure.

267
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:07,980
Um,

268
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,240
and then Alzheimer's,

269
00:08:09,241 --> 00:08:09,660
you know,

270
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,493
uh,

271
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:10,861
again,

272
00:08:10,861 --> 00:08:13,140
I know you're plus a plus 50,

273
00:08:13,141 --> 00:08:13,921
so you know,

274
00:08:13,921 --> 00:08:16,690
cheeks see Saint Jo has alzheimers.

275
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,650
I know that he wants to keep
doing this podcast for forever.

276
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,660
That'd be excused to stuff.

277
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,513
So,

278
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,730
so THC has been shown to inhibit the
formation of Beta amyloid plaques.

279
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:29,360
That's the,

280
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:29,531
you know,

281
00:08:29,531 --> 00:08:31,710
the hallmark of Alzheimer's disease.

282
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:36,960
And then CBD CBD has also been
shown to be effective for um,

283
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:38,550
for Alzheimer's disease as well.

284
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,220
It was a rat study that was going to,

285
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:40,770
um,

286
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:41,311
get into,

287
00:08:41,311 --> 00:08:42,630
but it's fairly fairly,

288
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:43,830
it's fairly detailed.

289
00:08:43,831 --> 00:08:44,431
So you know,

290
00:08:44,431 --> 00:08:46,140
it might be best just to say that it can,

291
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,153
you know,

292
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:52,310
help with rescue memory in patients if
you do use CBD meaning and that it may

293
00:08:52,381 --> 00:08:54,980
actually reverse and that's
been shown before to,

294
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,280
they've done that in mice.

295
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,960
I got to interrupt you for one second.

296
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,210
Okay.

297
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:00,420
And I think you would agree this data is,

298
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,033
some of it's,

299
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:03,810
some of it sort of epidemiological,

300
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,250
some of it's preclinical,

301
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:06,480
it's very,

302
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:07,590
very early.

303
00:09:07,591 --> 00:09:12,591
None of it really proves game and
just let me say I'm a clinician.

304
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,260
Okay.

305
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,660
If someone comes to me and
they have a concussion,

306
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,790
it's very frustrating just to say to them,

307
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:18,331
hey,

308
00:09:18,331 --> 00:09:18,901
physical,

309
00:09:18,901 --> 00:09:19,501
cognitive,

310
00:09:19,501 --> 00:09:19,890
rest,

311
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:20,520
go home.

312
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:20,761
Okay.

313
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:23,490
It's really frustrating to
say that to someone also to,

314
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:23,851
you know,

315
00:09:23,851 --> 00:09:24,391
the uh,

316
00:09:24,391 --> 00:09:25,590
the high fat diet thing.

317
00:09:25,591 --> 00:09:25,920
You know,

318
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,210
Joe and I both fall,

319
00:09:27,211 --> 00:09:27,421
you know,

320
00:09:27,421 --> 00:09:27,721
very,

321
00:09:27,721 --> 00:09:29,500
very similar die.

322
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,010
So that's something I wanted
to share with regards to,

323
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:32,440
you know,

324
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:32,670
the,

325
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:33,810
the Alzheimer's disease,

326
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:34,830
we have really,

327
00:09:34,831 --> 00:09:38,850
really poor medications for that
and we have an aging population.

328
00:09:38,851 --> 00:09:39,684
So again,

329
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:40,291
like Alex,

330
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:41,730
like you want to look at everything,

331
00:09:41,731 --> 00:09:42,570
which is what I'm doing.

332
00:09:42,571 --> 00:09:46,050
Like I'm looking at everything and I'm
trying to make a clinical decision.

333
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,510
Am I using some things like without,

334
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,170
you know,

335
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:50,670
randomized control trials?

336
00:09:50,671 --> 00:09:51,420
Of course I am.

337
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,110
But again,

338
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:53,640
I'm a clinician so I'm using,

339
00:09:53,641 --> 00:09:54,060
you know,

340
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,170
mechanisms of action.

341
00:09:55,171 --> 00:09:59,400
I'm using what I've see and clinic and
I'm using epidemiological studies and I'm

342
00:09:59,401 --> 00:10:03,480
also taking into account what other
medicines do I have your base upon all the

343
00:10:03,481 --> 00:10:03,790
data.

344
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:07,080
This seems to be an effective treatment
and I am absolutely not saying that you

345
00:10:07,081 --> 00:10:08,430
as a clinician shouldn't do that.

346
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:11,340
Especially you're in Canada
at t cannabis is legal.

347
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,360
You should,

348
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,980
you should use your best judgment.

349
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:18,240
What I'm saying is that when we're
talking about policy decisions around

350
00:10:18,241 --> 00:10:19,710
cannabis and Thc,

351
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,580
and to a much lesser extent,

352
00:10:21,581 --> 00:10:22,414
CBD,

353
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:25,410
the advocacy groups have
seized on this very,

354
00:10:25,411 --> 00:10:30,150
very preliminary data to to say a lot of
things about cannabis and THC that have

355
00:10:30,151 --> 00:10:31,200
not been proven.

356
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:32,221
And you know,

357
00:10:32,221 --> 00:10:33,810
a guy I know named Peter Bock,

358
00:10:33,811 --> 00:10:35,130
who very smart,

359
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:35,850
uh,

360
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:36,780
he's a pulmonologist,

361
00:10:36,781 --> 00:10:40,800
is at Memorial Sloan Kettering in New
York and he wrote a piece in the Wall

362
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:40,801
Street Journal,

363
00:10:40,801 --> 00:10:41,410
a few,

364
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:41,740
Oh,

365
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:45,330
a couple of weeks ago talking about
cannabis is limits as medicine.

366
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:48,120
And he said something that I
thought it was so well put,

367
00:10:48,121 --> 00:10:53,121
which is the reason why
people want cannabis to work
for Alzheimer's and cancer

368
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,121
and a bunch of things.

369
00:10:54,121 --> 00:10:54,570
Where does,

370
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:57,570
where there's really no evidence that
it works is that we don't have good

371
00:10:57,571 --> 00:10:58,404
treatments.

372
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,940
We want cures.

373
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,290
We want help.

374
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:01,891
We,

375
00:11:01,891 --> 00:11:02,760
if we're clinicians,

376
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:03,211
I mean,

377
00:11:03,211 --> 00:11:03,901
I'm not a clinician.

378
00:11:03,901 --> 00:11:04,650
You're a clinician.

379
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:07,350
Want to be able to give people who
come into our offices something.

380
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,170
But that hope is not a
substitute for science.

381
00:11:10,171 --> 00:11:12,000
It doesn't mean that it works.

382
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,220
And even you want,

383
00:11:14,221 --> 00:11:15,690
you want your patients to have hope.

384
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,650
Okay.

385
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:18,210
But the advocates,

386
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:18,900
the people,

387
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,550
we're using this to push,

388
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:25,200
especially to push THC and to capitalize
on the public confusion around THC and

389
00:11:25,201 --> 00:11:25,980
CBD.

390
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,230
I think that is a real,

391
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:29,200
it's a real

392
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,250
disservice to people.

393
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:31,983
Okay.

394
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:32,800
Um,

395
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,360
listen,

396
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:33,520
uh,

397
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,600
I think we covered everything.

398
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:36,880
So it's a complicated subject.

399
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:37,743
It really is.

400
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:38,320
And a,

401
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,410
I think it's really important to
discuss how complicated it is.

402
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:42,220
I don't,

403
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,690
I don't think there's a,

404
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:48,170
I've never heard such a detailed
analysis of all this stuff in,

405
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:51,130
in a way where you can get
two opposing people that are,

406
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:51,521
you know,

407
00:11:51,521 --> 00:11:52,540
very civil about it,

408
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:54,700
but agree on certain aspects of it.

409
00:11:54,701 --> 00:11:55,270
I think.

410
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,950
I think we really
highlighted all those things.
